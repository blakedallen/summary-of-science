      "Abstract In supersymmetric models the lightest Higgs boson may decay with a sizable branching ratio into a pair of light neutralinos. We analyze such decays within the context of the minimal supersymmetric standard model with R-parity violation, where the neutralino itself is unstable and decays into Standard Model fermions. At the LHC, the Higgs decay may be observed, for instance, through its decay -via two neutralinos- into final states containing missing energy and isolated charged particles [5, 6]. We also point out that Higgs searches at the LHC might additionally provide the first evidence of R-parity violation.\n",

The existence of these compressible, non-barotropic magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) modes requires that there be a maximum in the angular velocity  (r) of the accreting material larger than the angular velocity of the star , and that the fluid is in approximately circular motion near this maximum rather than moving rapidly towards the star or out of the disk plane into funnel flows. We suggest that the first mode with m = 1 is associated with the upper QPO frequency, u ; that the nonlinear interaction of the first and second modes gives the lower QPO frequency, l = u   ; and that the nonlinear interaction of the first and third modes gives the lower QPO frequency l = u   /2, where  =  /2.\n",

The effect on the cavity Q factor and mode volume of single diamond nanocrystals of various sizes and locations embedded in the center and on top of the nanocavity is simulated, demonstrating that Q > 2  105 is achievable for realistic parameters. An analysis of the figures of merit for cavity quantum electrodynamics reveals that strong coupling between an embedded diamond nitrogen-vacancy center and the cavity mode is achievable for a range of cavity dimensions.  2019 Optical Society of America OCIS codes: (230.5298) Photonic crystals; (230.5750) Optical devices,\n",

Several successful applications are presented, which show the capability of the kernel-based approach for detecting generalized synchronization, and dynamical change of the coupling strength between two chaotic systems can be captured by the proposed approach.\n",
