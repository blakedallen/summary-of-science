       "'This method was shown to be a generalization of the reference distribution method (Johnson and Riezler, 2000). Johnson and Riezler (2000) suggested the possibility of the method for adapting a stochastic unification-based grammar including HPSG to another domain. This model is introduced as a reference distribution (Jelinek, 1998; Johnson and Riezler, 2000) of the probabilistic HPSG model; i.e., the computation of parse trees given low probabilities by the model is omitted in the estimation stage (Miyao and Tsujii, 2005), or a probabilistic model can be augmented by several distributions estimated from the larger and simpler corpus (Johnson and Riezler, 2000). Johnson and Riezler (2000) achieved a gain of 1% over this result by including a classbased lexicalization. Johnson and Riezler (2000) looked at adding features to a maximum entropy model for stochastic unification-based grammars (SUBG), from corpora that are not annotated with the SUBG, but rather with simpler treebank annotations for which there are much larger treebanks.

       "'  Parallel texts have been used in a number of studies in computational linguistics. Brown et al (1993) defined a series of probabilistic translation models for MT purposes. While people may question the effectiveness of using these models for a full-blown MT system, the models are certainly valuable for developing translation assistance tools. For example, we can use such a translation model to help complete target ext being drafted by a human translator (Langlais et al, 2000)@@@@@Another utilization is in cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) where queries have to be translated from one language to another language in which the documents are written. In CLIR, the quality requirement for translation is relatively low. For example, the syntactic aspect is irrelevant. Even if the translated word is not a true translation but is strongly related to the original query, it is still helpful. Therefore, CLIR is a suitable application for such a translation model@@@@@However, a major obstacle to this approach is the lack of parallel corpora for model training. Only a few such corpora exist, including the Hansard English-French corpus and the HKUST EnglishChinese corpus (Wu, 1994). In this paper, we will describe a method which automatically searches for parallel texts on the Web. We will discuss the text mining algorithm we adopted, some issues in translation model training using the generated parallel corpus, and finally the translation models performance in CLIR@@@@@2 Para l le l  Text  M in ing  A lgor i thm The PTMiner system is an intelligent Web agent that is designed to search for large amounts of parallel text on the Web. The mining algorithm is largely language independent. It can thus be adapted to other language pairs with only minor modifications@@@@@Taking advantage ofWeb search engines as much as possible, PTMiner implements he following steps (illustrated in Fig. 1): 1 Search for candidate sites Using existing Web search engines, search for the candidate sites that may contain parallel pages; 2 File name fetching For each candidate site, fetch the URLs of Web pages that are indexed by the search engines; 3 Host crawling Starting from the URLs collected in the previous tep, search through each candidate site separately for more URLs; 4 Pair scan From the obtained URLs of each site, scan for possible parallel pairs; 5 Download and verifying Download the parallel pages, determine file size, language, and character set of each page, and filter out non-parallel pairs@@@@@2.1 Search for candidate Sites We take advantage of the huge number of Web sites indexed by existing search engines in determining candidate sites. This is done by submitting some particular equests to the search engines. The requests are determined according to the following observations. In the sites where parallel text exists, there are normally some pages in one language containing links to the parallel version in the other language. These are usually indicated by those links anchor texts 1. For example, on some English page there may be a link to its Chinese version with the anchor text \"Chinese Version\" or \"in Chinese\"@@@@@1An anchor text  is a piece of text on a Web page which, when clicked on, will take you to another linked page. To be helpful, it usual ly  contains the key information about the l inked page@@@@@21 Figure 1: The workflow of the mining process@@@@@The same phenomenon can be observed on Chinese pages. Chances are that a site with parallel texts will contain such links in some of its documents@@@@@This fact is used as the criterion in searching for candidate sites@@@@@Therefore, to determine possible sites for EnglishChinese parallel texts, we can request an English document containing the following anchor: anchor : \"engl ish version H \\\\[\"in english\", ...\\\\]@@@@@Similar requests are sent for Chinese documents@@@@@From the two sets of pages obtained by the above queries we extract wo sets of Web sites. The union of these two sets constitutes then the candidate sites@@@@@That  is to say, a site is a candidate site when it is found to have either an English page linking to its Chinese version or a Chinese page linking to its English version@@@@@2.2 File Name Fetching We now assume that a pair of parallel texts exists on the same site. To search for parallel pairs on a site, PTMiner first has to obtain all (or at least part of) the HTML file names on the site. From these names pairs are scanned. It is possible to use a Web crawler to explore the candidate sites completely. However, we can take advantage of the search engines again to accelerate the process. As the first step, we submit the following query to the search engines: host : hostname to fetch the Web pages that they indexed from this site. If we only require a small amount of parallel texts, this result may be sufficient. For our purpose, however, we need to explore the sites more thoroughly using a host crawler. Therefore, we continue our search for files with a host crawler which uses the documents found by the search engines as the starting point@@@@@2.3 Host Crawling A host crawler is slightly different from a Web crawler. Web crawlers go through innumerable pages and hosts on the Web. A host crawler is a Web crawler that crawls through documents on a given host only. A breadth-first crawling algorithm is applied in PTMiner as host crawler. The principle is that when a link to an unexplored ocument on the same site is found in a document, it is added to a list that will be explored later. In this way, most file names from the candidate sites are obtained@@@@@2.4 Pair Scan After collecting file names for each candidate site, the next task is to determine the parallel pairs@@@@@Again, we try to use some heuristic rules to guess which files may be parallel texts before downloading them. The rules are based on external features of the documents. By external feature, we mean those features which may be known without analyzing the contents of the file, such as its URL, size, and date@@@@@This is in contrast with the internal features, such as language, character set, and HTML structure, which cannot be known until we have downloaded the page and analyzed its contents@@@@@The heuristic criterion comes from the following observation: We observe that parallel text pairs usually have similar name patterns. The difference between the names of two parailel pages usually lies in a segment which indicates the language. For example, \"file-ch.html\" (in Chinese) vs. \"file-en.html\" (in English). The difference may also appear in the path, such as \".../chinese/.../fi le.html\" vs. \".../english/.../f i le.html. The name patterns described above are commonly used by webmasters to help organize their sites. Hence, we can suppose that a pair of pages with this kind of pattern are probably parallel texts@@@@@22First, we establish four lists for English prefixes, English suffixes, Chinese prefixes and Chinese suffixes. For example: Engl ish P re f ix  = {e, en, e_, en_, e ,  en ,  ...}. For each file in one language, if a segment in its name corresponds to one of the language affixes, several new names are generated by changing the segment to the possible corresponding affixes of the other language. If a generated name corresponds to an existing file, then the file is considered as a candidate parallel document of the original file@@@@@2.5 Filtering Next, we further examine the contents of the paired files to determine if they are really parallel according to various external and internal features. This may further improve the pairing precision. The following methods have been implemented in our system@@@@@2.5.1 Text Length Parallel files often have similar file lengths. One simple way to filter out incorrect pairs is to compare the lengths of the two files. The only problem is to set a reasonable threshold that will not discard too many good pairs, i.e. balance recall and precision@@@@@The usual difference ratio depends on the language pairs we are dealing with. For example, ChineseEnglish parallel texts usually have a larger difference ratio than English-French parallel texts. The filtering threshold had to be determined empirically, from the actual observations. For Chinese-English, a difference up to 50% is tolerated@@@@@2.5.2 Language and  Character Set It is also obvious that the two files of a pair have to be in the two languages of interest. By automatically identifying language and character set, we can filter out the pairs that do not satisfy this basic criterion. Some Web pages explicitly indicate the language and the character set. More often such information is omitted by authors. We need some language identification tool for this task@@@@@SILC is a language and encoding identification system developed by the RALI laboratory at the University of Montreal. It employs a probabilistic model estimated on tri-grams. Using these models, the system is able to determine the most probable language and encoding of a text (Isabelle et al, 1997)@@@@@2.5.3 HTML Structure and Alignment In the STRAND system (Resnik, 1998), the candidate pairs are evaluated by aligning them according to their HTML structures and computing confidence values. Pairs are assumed to be wrong if they have too many mismatching markups or low confidence values@@@@@Comparing HTML structures seems to be a sound way to evaluate candidate pairs since parallel pairs usually have similar HTML structures. However, we also noticed that parallel texts may have quite different HTML structures. One of the reasons is that the two files may be created using two HTML editors. For example, one may be used for English and another for Chinese, depending on the language handling capability of the editors. Therefore, caution is required when measuring structure difference numerically@@@@@Parallel text alignment is still an experimental area. Measuring the confidence values of an alignment is even more complicated. For example, the alignment algorithm we used in the training of the statistical translation model produces acceptable alignment results but it does not provide a confidence value that we can \"confidently\" use as an evaluation criterion. So, for the moment his criterion is not used in candidate pair evaluation@@@@@3 Generated  Corpus  and Trans la t ion  Mode l  Tra in ing  In this section, we describe the results of our parallel text mining and translation model training@@@@@3.1 The Corpus Using the above approach for Chinese-English, 185 candidate sites were searched from the domain hk@@@@@We limited the mining domain to hk because Hong Kong is a bilingual English-Chinese city where high quality parallel Web sites exist. Because of the small number of candidate sites, the host crawler was used to thoroughly explore each site. The resulting corpus contains 14820 pairs of texts including 117.2Mb Chinese texts and 136.5Mb English texts. The entire mining process lasted about a week. Using length comparison and language identification, we refined the precision of the corpus to about 90%. The precision is estimated by examining 367 randomly picked pairs@@@@@3.2 Statistical Translation Model Many approaches in computational linguistics try to extract ranslation knowledge from previous translation examples. Most work of this kind establishes probabilistic models from parallel corpora. Based on one of the statistical models proposed by Brown et al (1993), the basic principle of our translation model is the following: given a corpus of aligned sentences, if two words often co-occur in the source and target sentences, there is a good likelihood that they are translations of each other. In the simplest case (model 1), the model earns the probability, p(tls), of having a word t in the translation of a sentence containing a word s. For an input sentence, the model then calculates a sequence of words that are most probable to appear in its translation. Using a similar statistical model, Wu (1995) extracted a largescale English-Chinese l xicon from the HKUST cor23  <s id=\"00~\"> <HTML> <HEAD> <META HTrP-EQUIV=\"Content-type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset--iso-8859-1\"> <META HTIP-EQUIV=\"Content-language\" CONTENT=\"Western\"> </s> <s id=\"0001\"> <TITLE>Journal of Primary Education 1996, VoI., No. l&2, pp. 19-27 </TITLE> </HEAD> </s> <s id=\"0002\"> <BODY BACKGROUND=\".Jgif/pejbg.jpg\" TEXT=\"#000(3(O\" BGCOLOR=\"#ffffff\"> <CENTER> </s> <s id=\"0003\"> <HI>Journal of Primary Education </HI> </s> <s id=\"0004\"> <HR> <B>Volume 6, No l&2, pp. 19-27 (May, 1996) </B> <HR> </s> <s id=\"0005\"> <H3>Principles for Redesigning Teacher Education </H3> Alan TOM </CENTER> </s> <s id=\"0006\"> <P> <B> <I> Abstract </I> </B> </s> <s id=\"0000\"> <HTML> <HEAD> <META HITP-EQUW=\"Content-type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=bigS\"> <META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-language\" CONTENT=\"zh\"> <Is> <s id=\"0001\"> <TITLE> Journal of Primary Education 1996, Vol., No. l&2, Page 19-27 </TITLE> </HEAD> </s> <s id=\"0002\"> <BODY BACKGROUND=\".Jgif/pejbg.jpg\" TEXT=\"#000000\" BGCOLOR=\"#ffffff\"> <A HREF=\"/erdpej/b2g__pej.phtml?URL=%2fen%2fp ej%2f0601%2f0601019c.htm\"> <IMG SRC=\"/en/gif/kan.gif\" ALT=\"~\"  BORDER=0 ALIGN=R IGHT> </A> <CENTER> </s> <s id=\"0003\"> <H2>~ ~ 11I ~ O.</H2> </s> <s id=\"0004\"> <HR> (~:~h-fv-c?.JLJl) ~,-\\\\]?~.@@@@@</s> <s id=\"0005\"> ~ 19-27\\\\]~ <I-1R> </s> Figure 2: An alignment example using pure length-based method@@@@@pus which is built manually. In our case, the probabilistic translation model will be used for CLIR@@@@@The requirement on our translation model may be less demanding: it is not absolutely necessary that a word t with high p(tls ) always be a true translation of s. It is still useful if t is strongly related to s. For example, although \"railway\" is not a true translation of \"train\" (in French), it is highly useful to include \"railway\" in the translation of a query on \"train\". This is one of the reasons why we think a less controlled parallel corpus can be used to train a translation model for CLIR@@@@@3.3 Parallel Text Al ignment Before the mined documents can be aligned into parallel sentences, the raw texts have to undergo a series of some preprocessing, which, to some extent, is language dependent. For example, the major operations on the Chinese-English corpus include encoding scheme transformation (for Chinese), sentence level segmentation, parallel text alignment, Chinese word segmentation (Nie et al, 1999) and English expression extraction@@@@@The parallel Web pages we collected from various sites are not all of the same quality. Some are highly parallel and easy to align while others can be very noisy. Aligning English-Chinese parallel texts is already very difficult because of the great differences in the syntactic structures and writing systems of the two languages. A number of alignment techniques have been proposed, varying from statistical methods (Brown et al, 1991; Gale and Church, 1991) to lexical methods (Kay and RSscheisen, 1993; Chen, 1993). The method we adopted is that of Simard et al (1992). Because it considers both length similarity and cognateness as alignment criteria, the method is more robust and better able to deal with noise than pure length-based methods@@@@@Cognates are identical sequences of characters in corresponding words in two languages. They are commonly found in English and French. In the case of English-Chinese alignment, where there are no cognates shared by the two languages, only the HTML markup in both texts are taken as cognates. Because the HTML structures of parallel pages are normally similar, the markup was found to be helpful for alignment@@@@@To illustrate how markup can help with the alignment, we align the same pair with both the pure length-based method of Gale & Church (Fig. 2), and the method of Simard et al (Fig. 3).

The sentences are marked by <s id=\"xxxx\"> and </s>.  Note that we determine sentences not only by periods, but also by means of HTML markup@@@@@We further notice that it is difficult to align sentences 0002. The sentence in the Chinese page is much longer than its counterpart in the English page because some additional information (font) is added@@@@@The length-based method thus tends to take sentence 0002, 0003, and 0004 in the English page as the translation of sentence 0002 in the Chinese page (Fig. 2), which is wrong. This in turn provocated the three following incorrect alignments. As we can see in Fig. 3, the cognate method did not make the same mistake because of the noise in sentence 0002@@@@@Despite their large length difference, the two 0002 sentences are still aligned as a 1-1 pair, because the sentences in the following 4 alignments (0003 0003; 0004 0004, 0005; 0005 0006; 0006 0007) have rather similar HTML markups and are taken by the program to be the most likely alignments@@@@@Beside HTML markups, other criteria may also be incorporated. For example, it would be helpful to consider strong correspondence b tween certain English and Chinese words, as in (Wu, 1994). We hope to implement such correspondences in our future research@@@@@3.4 Lex icon  Eva luat ion  To evaluate the precision of the English-Chinese translation model trained on the Web corpus, we examined two sample lexicons of 200 words, one in each direction. The 200 words for each lexicon were randomly selected from the training source. We examined the most probable translation for each word@@@@@The Chinese-English lexicon was found to have a precision of 77%. The English-Chinese l xicon has a higher precision of 81.5%. Part of the lexicons are shown in Fig. 4, where t / f  indicates whether a translation is true or false@@@@@These precisions seem to be reasonably high@@@@@They are quite comparable to that obtained by Wu (1994) using a manual Chinese-English parallel corpus@@@@@3.5 Effect  o f  S topwords  We also found that stop-lists have significant effect on the translation model.

Because these words exist in most alignments, the statistical model cannot derive correct translations for them. More importantly, their existence greatly affects the accuracy of other translations. They can be taken as translations for many words@@@@@A priori, it would seem that both the English and Chinese stop-lists hould be applied to eliminate the noise caused by them. Interestingly, from our observation and analysis we concluded that for better precision, only the stop-list of the target language should be applied in the model training@@@@@We first explain why the stop-list of the target language has to be applied. On the left side of Fig. 5, if the Chinese word C exists in the same alignments with the English word E more than any other Chinese words, C will be the most probable translation for E. Because of their frequent appearance, some Chinese stopwords may have more chances to be in the same alignments with E. The probability of the translation E --+ C is then reduced (maybe ven less than those of the incorrect ones). This is the reason why many English words are translated to \"~   (of) by the translation model trained without using the Chinese stop-list@@@@@We also found that it is not necessary to remove the stopwords of the source language. In fact, as illustrated on the right side of Fig. 5, the existence of the English stopwords has two effects on the probability of the translation E -~ C: 1 They may often be found together with the Chinese word C. Owing to the Expectation Maximization algorithm, the probability of E -~ C may therefore be reduced@@@@@2 On the other hand, there is a greater likelihood that English stopwords will be found together with the most frequent Chinese words. Here, we use the term \"Chinese frequent words\" instead of \"Chinese stopwords\" because ven if a stop-list is applied, there may still remain some common words that have the same effect as the stopwords. The coexistence ofEnglish and Chinese frequent words reduces the probability that the Chinese frequent words are the translations of E, and thus raise the probability of E -+ C@@@@@The second effect was found to be more significant than the first, since the model trained without the English stopwords has better precision than the model trained with the English stopwords. For the correct ranslations given by both models, the model 26Mono-Lingual IR Translation Model Dictionary C-E CLIR 0.3861 0.1504 (39.0%mono) 0.1530 (39.6%mono) 0.2583 (66.9%mono) E-C CLIR 0.3976 0.1841 (46.3%mono) 0.1427 (35.9%mono) 0.2232 (56.1%mono) Table 1: CLIR results@@@@@trained without considering the English stopwords gives higher probabilities@@@@@4 Eng l i sh -Ch inese  CL IR  Resu l ts  Our final goal was to test the performance of the translation models trained on the Web parallel corpora in CLIR. We conducted CLIR experiments u ing the Smart IR system@@@@@4.1 Results  The English test corpus (for C-E CLIR) was the AP corpus used in TREC6 and TREC7. The short English queries were translated manually into Chinese and then translated back to English by the translation model. The Chinese test corpus was the one used in the TREC5 and TREC6 Chinese track@@@@@It contains both Chinese queries and their English translations@@@@@Our experiments on these two corpora produced the results hown in Tab. 1. The precision of monolingual IR is given as benchmark. In both E-C and C-E CLIR, the translation model achieved around 40% of monolingual precision. To compare with the dictionary-based approach, we employed a ChineseEnglish dictionary, CEDICT (Denisowski, 1999), and an English-Chinese online dictionary (Anonymous, 1999a) to translate queries. For each word of the source query, all the possible translations given by the dictionary are included in the translated query. The Chinese-English dictionary has about the same performace as the translation model, while the English-Chinese dictionary has lower precision than that of the translation model@@@@@We also tried to combine the translations given by the translation model and the dictionary. In both C-E and E-C CLIR, significant improvements were achieved (as shown in Tab. 1). The improvements show that the translations given by the translation model and the dictionary complement each other well for IR purposes. The translation model may give either exact ranslations orincorrect but related words. Even though these words are not correct in the sense of translation, they are very possibly related to the subject of the query and thus helpful for IR purposes. The dictionary-based approach expands a query along another dimension. It gives all the possible translations for each word including those that are missed by the translation model@@@@@4.2 Comparison Wi th  MT Systems One advantage of a parallel text-based translation model is that it is easier to build than an MT system@@@@@Now that we have examined the CLIR performance of the translation model, we will compare it with two existing MT systems. Both systems were tested in E-C CLIR@@@@@4.2.1 Sunshine WebTran Server Using the Sunshine WebTran server (Anonymous, 1999b), an online Engiish-Chinese MT system, to translate the 54 English queries, we obtained an average precision of 0.2001, which is 50.3% of the mono-lingual precision. The precision is higher than that obtained using the translation model (0.1804) or the dictionary (0.1427) alone, but lower than the precison obtained using them together (0.2232)@@@@@4.2.2 Transperfect Kwok (1999) investigated the CLIR performance ofan English-Chinese MT software called Transperfect, using the same TREC Chinese collection as we used in this study. Using the MT software alone, Kwok achieved 56% of monolingual precision. The precision is improved to 62% by refining the translation with a dictionary. Kwok also adopted pretranslation query expansion, which further improved the precison to 70% of the monolingual results@@@@@In our case, the best E-C CLIR precison using the translation model (and dictionary) is 56.1%. It is lower than what Kwok achieved using Transperfect, however, the difference is not large@@@@@4.3 Further  Problems The Chinese-English translation model has a fax lower CLIR performance than that of the EnglishFrench model established using the same method (Nie et al, 1999). The principal reason for this is the fact that English and Chinese are much more different than English and French. This problem surfaced in many phases of this work, from text alignment to query translation. Below, we list some further factors affecting CLIR precision@@@@@? The Web-collected corpus is noisy and it is difficult to align English-Chinese t xts. The alignment method we employed has performed more poorly than on English-French alignment. This in turn leads to poorer performance of the translation model. In general, we observe a higher 27 variability in Chinese-English translations than in English-French translations@@@@@? For E-C CLIR, although queries in both languages were provided, the English queries were not strictly translated from the original Chinese ones. For example, A Jg ,~ (human right situation) was translated into human right issue. We cannot expect he translation model to translate issue back to ~ (situation)@@@@@? The training source and the CLIR collections were from different domains. The Web corpus are retrieved from the parallel sites in Hong Kong while the Chinese collection is from Peoples Daily and Xinhua News Agency, which are published in mainland China. As the result, some important erms such as ~$ $ (mostfavored-nation) and --I!! ~ ~ (one-nation-twosystems) in the collection are not known by the model@@@@@5 Summary  The goal of this work was to investigate he feasibility of using a statistical translation model trained on a Web-collected corpus to do English-Chinese CLIR@@@@@In this paper, we have described the algorithm and implementation we used for parallel text mining, translation model training, and some results we obtained in CLIR experiments. Although further work remains to be done, we can conclude that it is possible to automatically construct a Chinese-English parallel corpus from the Web. The current system can be easily adapted to other language pairs. Despite the noisy nature of the corpus and the great difference in the languages, the evaluation lexicons generated by the translation model produced acceptable precision. While the current CLIR results are not as encouraging asthose of English-French CLIR, they could be improved in various ways, such as improving the alignment method by adapting cognate definitions to HTML markup, incorporating a lexicon and/or removing some common function words in translated queries@@@@@We hope to be able to demonstrate in the near future that a fine-tuned English-Chinese translation model can provide query translations for CLIR with the same quality produced by MT systems@@@@@Re ferences  Anonymous. 1999a.

       "'  Parallel texts have been used in a number of studies in computational linguistics. Brown et al (1993) defined a series of probabilistic translation models for MT purposes. While people may question the effectiveness of using these models for a full-blown MT system, the models are certainly valuable for developing translation assistance tools. For example, we can use such a translation model to help complete target ext being drafted by a human translator (Langlais et al, 2000)@@@@@Another utilization is in cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) where queries have to be translated from one language to another language in which the documents are written. In CLIR, the quality requirement for translation is relatively low. For example, the syntactic aspect is irrelevant. Even if the translated word is not a true translation but is strongly related to the original query, it is still helpful. Therefore, CLIR is a suitable application for such a translation model@@@@@However, a major obstacle to this approach is the lack of parallel corpora for model training. Only a few such corpora exist, including the Hansard English-French corpus and the HKUST EnglishChinese corpus (Wu, 1994). In this paper, we will describe a method which automatically searches for parallel texts on the Web. We will discuss the text mining algorithm we adopted, some issues in translation model training using the generated parallel corpus, and finally the translation models performance in CLIR@@@@@2 Para l le l  Text  M in ing  A lgor i thm The PTMiner system is an intelligent Web agent that is designed to search for large amounts of parallel text on the Web. The mining algorithm is largely language independent. It can thus be adapted to other language pairs with only minor modifications@@@@@Taking advantage ofWeb search engines as much as possible, PTMiner implements he following steps (illustrated in Fig. 1): 1 Search for candidate sites Using existing Web search engines, search for the candidate sites that may contain parallel pages; 2 File name fetching For each candidate site, fetch the URLs of Web pages that are indexed by the search engines; 3 Host crawling Starting from the URLs collected in the previous tep, search through each candidate site separately for more URLs; 4 Pair scan From the obtained URLs of each site, scan for possible parallel pairs; 5 Download and verifying Download the parallel pages, determine file size, language, and character set of each page, and filter out non-parallel pairs@@@@@2.1 Search for candidate Sites We take advantage of the huge number of Web sites indexed by existing search engines in determining candidate sites. This is done by submitting some particular equests to the search engines. The requests are determined according to the following observations. In the sites where parallel text exists, there are normally some pages in one language containing links to the parallel version in the other language. These are usually indicated by those links anchor texts 1. For example, on some English page there may be a link to its Chinese version with the anchor text \"Chinese Version\" or \"in Chinese\"@@@@@1An anchor text  is a piece of text on a Web page which, when clicked on, will take you to another linked page. To be helpful, it usual ly  contains the key information about the l inked page@@@@@21 Figure 1: The workflow of the mining process@@@@@The same phenomenon can be observed on Chinese pages. Chances are that a site with parallel texts will contain such links in some of its documents@@@@@This fact is used as the criterion in searching for candidate sites@@@@@Therefore, to determine possible sites for EnglishChinese parallel texts, we can request an English document containing the following anchor: anchor : \"engl ish version H \\\\[\"in english\", ...\\\\]@@@@@Similar requests are sent for Chinese documents@@@@@From the two sets of pages obtained by the above queries we extract wo sets of Web sites. The union of these two sets constitutes then the candidate sites@@@@@That  is to say, a site is a candidate site when it is found to have either an English page linking to its Chinese version or a Chinese page linking to its English version@@@@@2.2 File Name Fetching We now assume that a pair of parallel texts exists on the same site. To search for parallel pairs on a site, PTMiner first has to obtain all (or at least part of) the HTML file names on the site. From these names pairs are scanned. It is possible to use a Web crawler to explore the candidate sites completely. However, we can take advantage of the search engines again to accelerate the process. As the first step, we submit the following query to the search engines: host : hostname to fetch the Web pages that they indexed from this site. If we only require a small amount of parallel texts, this result may be sufficient. For our purpose, however, we need to explore the sites more thoroughly using a host crawler. Therefore, we continue our search for files with a host crawler which uses the documents found by the search engines as the starting point@@@@@2.3 Host Crawling A host crawler is slightly different from a Web crawler. Web crawlers go through innumerable pages and hosts on the Web. A host crawler is a Web crawler that crawls through documents on a given host only. A breadth-first crawling algorithm is applied in PTMiner as host crawler. The principle is that when a link to an unexplored ocument on the same site is found in a document, it is added to a list that will be explored later. In this way, most file names from the candidate sites are obtained@@@@@2.4 Pair Scan After collecting file names for each candidate site, the next task is to determine the parallel pairs@@@@@Again, we try to use some heuristic rules to guess which files may be parallel texts before downloading them. The rules are based on external features of the documents. By external feature, we mean those features which may be known without analyzing the contents of the file, such as its URL, size, and date@@@@@This is in contrast with the internal features, such as language, character set, and HTML structure, which cannot be known until we have downloaded the page and analyzed its contents@@@@@The heuristic criterion comes from the following observation: We observe that parallel text pairs usually have similar name patterns. The difference between the names of two parailel pages usually lies in a segment which indicates the language. For example, \"file-ch.html\" (in Chinese) vs. \"file-en.html\" (in English). The difference may also appear in the path, such as \".../chinese/.../fi le.html\" vs. \".../english/.../f i le.html. The name patterns described above are commonly used by webmasters to help organize their sites. Hence, we can suppose that a pair of pages with this kind of pattern are probably parallel texts@@@@@22First, we establish four lists for English prefixes, English suffixes, Chinese prefixes and Chinese suffixes. For example: Engl ish P re f ix  = {e, en, e_, en_, e ,  en ,  ...}. For each file in one language, if a segment in its name corresponds to one of the language affixes, several new names are generated by changing the segment to the possible corresponding affixes of the other language. If a generated name corresponds to an existing file, then the file is considered as a candidate parallel document of the original file@@@@@2.5 Filtering Next, we further examine the contents of the paired files to determine if they are really parallel according to various external and internal features. This may further improve the pairing precision. The following methods have been implemented in our system@@@@@2.5.1 Text Length Parallel files often have similar file lengths. One simple way to filter out incorrect pairs is to compare the lengths of the two files. The only problem is to set a reasonable threshold that will not discard too many good pairs, i.e. balance recall and precision@@@@@The usual difference ratio depends on the language pairs we are dealing with. For example, ChineseEnglish parallel texts usually have a larger difference ratio than English-French parallel texts. The filtering threshold had to be determined empirically, from the actual observations. For Chinese-English, a difference up to 50% is tolerated@@@@@2.5.2 Language and  Character Set It is also obvious that the two files of a pair have to be in the two languages of interest. By automatically identifying language and character set, we can filter out the pairs that do not satisfy this basic criterion. Some Web pages explicitly indicate the language and the character set. More often such information is omitted by authors. We need some language identification tool for this task@@@@@SILC is a language and encoding identification system developed by the RALI laboratory at the University of Montreal. It employs a probabilistic model estimated on tri-grams. Using these models, the system is able to determine the most probable language and encoding of a text (Isabelle et al, 1997)@@@@@2.5.3 HTML Structure and Alignment In the STRAND system (Resnik, 1998), the candidate pairs are evaluated by aligning them according to their HTML structures and computing confidence values. Pairs are assumed to be wrong if they have too many mismatching markups or low confidence values@@@@@Comparing HTML structures seems to be a sound way to evaluate candidate pairs since parallel pairs usually have similar HTML structures. However, we also noticed that parallel texts may have quite different HTML structures. One of the reasons is that the two files may be created using two HTML editors. For example, one may be used for English and another for Chinese, depending on the language handling capability of the editors. Therefore, caution is required when measuring structure difference numerically@@@@@Parallel text alignment is still an experimental area. Measuring the confidence values of an alignment is even more complicated. For example, the alignment algorithm we used in the training of the statistical translation model produces acceptable alignment results but it does not provide a confidence value that we can \"confidently\" use as an evaluation criterion. So, for the moment his criterion is not used in candidate pair evaluation@@@@@3 Generated  Corpus  and Trans la t ion  Mode l  Tra in ing  In this section, we describe the results of our parallel text mining and translation model training@@@@@3.1 The Corpus Using the above approach for Chinese-English, 185 candidate sites were searched from the domain hk@@@@@We limited the mining domain to hk because Hong Kong is a bilingual English-Chinese city where high quality parallel Web sites exist. Because of the small number of candidate sites, the host crawler was used to thoroughly explore each site. The resulting corpus contains 14820 pairs of texts including 117.2Mb Chinese texts and 136.5Mb English texts. The entire mining process lasted about a week. Using length comparison and language identification, we refined the precision of the corpus to about 90%. The precision is estimated by examining 367 randomly picked pairs@@@@@3.2 Statistical Translation Model Many approaches in computational linguistics try to extract ranslation knowledge from previous translation examples. Most work of this kind establishes probabilistic models from parallel corpora. Based on one of the statistical models proposed by Brown et al (1993), the basic principle of our translation model is the following: given a corpus of aligned sentences, if two words often co-occur in the source and target sentences, there is a good likelihood that they are translations of each other. In the simplest case (model 1), the model earns the probability, p(tls), of having a word t in the translation of a sentence containing a word s. For an input sentence, the model then calculates a sequence of words that are most probable to appear in its translation. Using a similar statistical model, Wu (1995) extracted a largescale English-Chinese l xicon from the HKUST cor23  <s id=\"00~\"> <HTML> <HEAD> <META HTrP-EQUIV=\"Content-type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset--iso-8859-1\"> <META HTIP-EQUIV=\"Content-language\" CONTENT=\"Western\"> </s> <s id=\"0001\"> <TITLE>Journal of Primary Education 1996, VoI., No. l&2, pp. 19-27 </TITLE> </HEAD> </s> <s id=\"0002\"> <BODY BACKGROUND=\".Jgif/pejbg.jpg\" TEXT=\"#000(3(O\" BGCOLOR=\"#ffffff\"> <CENTER> </s> <s id=\"0003\"> <HI>Journal of Primary Education </HI> </s> <s id=\"0004\"> <HR> <B>Volume 6, No l&2, pp. 19-27 (May, 1996) </B> <HR> </s> <s id=\"0005\"> <H3>Principles for Redesigning Teacher Education </H3> Alan TOM </CENTER> </s> <s id=\"0006\"> <P> <B> <I> Abstract </I> </B> </s> <s id=\"0000\"> <HTML> <HEAD> <META HITP-EQUW=\"Content-type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=bigS\"> <META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-language\" CONTENT=\"zh\"> <Is> <s id=\"0001\"> <TITLE> Journal of Primary Education 1996, Vol., No. l&2, Page 19-27 </TITLE> </HEAD> </s> <s id=\"0002\"> <BODY BACKGROUND=\".Jgif/pejbg.jpg\" TEXT=\"#000000\" BGCOLOR=\"#ffffff\"> <A HREF=\"/erdpej/b2g__pej.phtml?URL=%2fen%2fp ej%2f0601%2f0601019c.htm\"> <IMG SRC=\"/en/gif/kan.gif\" ALT=\"~\"  BORDER=0 ALIGN=R IGHT> </A> <CENTER> </s> <s id=\"0003\"> <H2>~ ~ 11I ~ O.</H2> </s> <s id=\"0004\"> <HR> (~:~h-fv-c?.JLJl) ~,-\\\\]?~.@@@@@</s> <s id=\"0005\"> ~ 19-27\\\\]~ <I-1R> </s> Figure 2: An alignment example using pure length-based method@@@@@pus which is built manually. In our case, the probabilistic translation model will be used for CLIR@@@@@The requirement on our translation model may be less demanding: it is not absolutely necessary that a word t with high p(tls ) always be a true translation of s. It is still useful if t is strongly related to s. For example, although \"railway\" is not a true translation of \"train\" (in French), it is highly useful to include \"railway\" in the translation of a query on \"train\". This is one of the reasons why we think a less controlled parallel corpus can be used to train a translation model for CLIR@@@@@3.3 Parallel Text Al ignment Before the mined documents can be aligned into parallel sentences, the raw texts have to undergo a series of some preprocessing, which, to some extent, is language dependent. For example, the major operations on the Chinese-English corpus include encoding scheme transformation (for Chinese), sentence level segmentation, parallel text alignment, Chinese word segmentation (Nie et al, 1999) and English expression extraction@@@@@The parallel Web pages we collected from various sites are not all of the same quality. Some are highly parallel and easy to align while others can be very noisy. Aligning English-Chinese parallel texts is already very difficult because of the great differences in the syntactic structures and writing systems of the two languages. A number of alignment techniques have been proposed, varying from statistical methods (Brown et al, 1991; Gale and Church, 1991) to lexical methods (Kay and RSscheisen, 1993; Chen, 1993). The method we adopted is that of Simard et al (1992). Because it considers both length similarity and cognateness as alignment criteria, the method is more robust and better able to deal with noise than pure length-based methods@@@@@Cognates are identical sequences of characters in corresponding words in two languages. They are commonly found in English and French. In the case of English-Chinese alignment, where there are no cognates shared by the two languages, only the HTML markup in both texts are taken as cognates. Because the HTML structures of parallel pages are normally similar, the markup was found to be helpful for alignment@@@@@To illustrate how markup can help with the alignment, we align the same pair with both the pure length-based method of Gale & Church (Fig. 2), and the method of Simard et al (Fig. 3). First of all, we observe from the figures that the two texts are 24<s id=\"0000\"> <HTML> <HEAD> <META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-type\" CONTENT=\"text/html; charset=iso-8859-1 \"> <META HTTP-EQUIV=\"Content-language\" CONTENT=\"Westem\"> </s> <s id=\"0001\"> <TITLE>Journal of Primary Education 1996, Vol., No. l&2, pp. 19-27 </TITLE> </HEAD> </s> <s id=\"0002\"> <BODY BACKGROUND=-\".

The sentences are marked by <s id=\"xxxx\"> and </s>.  Note that we determine sentences not only by periods, but also by means of HTML markup@@@@@We further notice that it is difficult to align sentences 0002. The sentence in the Chinese page is much longer than its counterpart in the English page because some additional information (font) is added@@@@@The length-based method thus tends to take sentence 0002, 0003, and 0004 in the English page as the translation of sentence 0002 in the Chinese page (Fig. 2), which is wrong. This in turn provocated the three following incorrect alignments. As we can see in Fig. 3, the cognate method did not make the same mistake because of the noise in sentence 0002@@@@@Despite their large length difference, the two 0002 sentences are still aligned as a 1-1 pair, because the sentences in the following 4 alignments (0003 0003; 0004 0004, 0005; 0005 0006; 0006 0007) have rather similar HTML markups and are taken by the program to be the most likely alignments@@@@@Beside HTML markups, other criteria may also be incorporated. For example, it would be helpful to consider strong correspondence b tween certain English and Chinese words, as in (Wu, 1994). We hope to implement such correspondences in our future research@@@@@3.4 Lex icon  Eva luat ion  To evaluate the precision of the English-Chinese translation model trained on the Web corpus, we examined two sample lexicons of 200 words, one in each direction. The 200 words for each lexicon were randomly selected from the training source. We examined the most probable translation for each word@@@@@The Chinese-English lexicon was found to have a precision of 77%. The English-Chinese l xicon has a higher precision of 81.5%. Part of the lexicons are shown in Fig. 4, where t / f  indicates whether a translation is true or false@@@@@These precisions seem to be reasonably high@@@@@They are quite comparable to that obtained by Wu (1994) using a manual Chinese-English parallel corpus@@@@@3.5 Effect  o f  S topwords  We also found that stop-lists have significant effect on the translation model.

Because these words exist in most alignments, the statistical model cannot derive correct translations for them. More importantly, their existence greatly affects the accuracy of other translations. They can be taken as translations for many words@@@@@A priori, it would seem that both the English and Chinese stop-lists hould be applied to eliminate the noise caused by them. Interestingly, from our observation and analysis we concluded that for better precision, only the stop-list of the target language should be applied in the model training@@@@@We first explain why the stop-list of the target language has to be applied. On the left side of Fig. 5, if the Chinese word C exists in the same alignments with the English word E more than any other Chinese words, C will be the most probable translation for E. Because of their frequent appearance, some Chinese stopwords may have more chances to be in the same alignments with E. The probability of the translation E --+ C is then reduced (maybe ven less than those of the incorrect ones). This is the reason why many English words are translated to \"~   (of) by the translation model trained without using the Chinese stop-list@@@@@We also found that it is not necessary to remove the stopwords of the source language. In fact, as illustrated on the right side of Fig. 5, the existence of the English stopwords has two effects on the probability of the translation E -~ C: 1 They may often be found together with the Chinese word C. Owing to the Expectation Maximization algorithm, the probability of E -~ C may therefore be reduced@@@@@2 On the other hand, there is a greater likelihood that English stopwords will be found together with the most frequent Chinese words. Here, we use the term \"Chinese frequent words\" instead of \"Chinese stopwords\" because ven if a stop-list is applied, there may still remain some common words that have the same effect as the stopwords. The coexistence ofEnglish and Chinese frequent words reduces the probability that the Chinese frequent words are the translations of E, and thus raise the probability of E -+ C@@@@@The second effect was found to be more significant than the first, since the model trained without the English stopwords has better precision than the model trained with the English stopwords. For the correct ranslations given by both models, the model 26Mono-Lingual IR Translation Model Dictionary C-E CLIR 0.3861 0.1504 (39.0%mono) 0.1530 (39.6%mono) 0.2583 (66.9%mono) E-C CLIR 0.3976 0.1841 (46.3%mono) 0.1427 (35.9%mono) 0.2232 (56.1%mono) Table 1: CLIR results@@@@@trained without considering the English stopwords gives higher probabilities@@@@@4 Eng l i sh -Ch inese  CL IR  Resu l ts  Our final goal was to test the performance of the translation models trained on the Web parallel corpora in CLIR. We conducted CLIR experiments u ing the Smart IR system@@@@@4.1 Results  The English test corpus (for C-E CLIR) was the AP corpus used in TREC6 and TREC7. The short English queries were translated manually into Chinese and then translated back to English by the translation model. The Chinese test corpus was the one used in the TREC5 and TREC6 Chinese track@@@@@It contains both Chinese queries and their English translations@@@@@Our experiments on these two corpora produced the results hown in Tab. 1. The precision of monolingual IR is given as benchmark. In both E-C and C-E CLIR, the translation model achieved around 40% of monolingual precision. To compare with the dictionary-based approach, we employed a ChineseEnglish dictionary, CEDICT (Denisowski, 1999), and an English-Chinese online dictionary (Anonymous, 1999a) to translate queries. For each word of the source query, all the possible translations given by the dictionary are included in the translated query. The Chinese-English dictionary has about the same performace as the translation model, while the English-Chinese dictionary has lower precision than that of the translation model@@@@@We also tried to combine the translations given by the translation model and the dictionary. In both C-E and E-C CLIR, significant improvements were achieved (as shown in Tab. 1). The improvements show that the translations given by the translation model and the dictionary complement each other well for IR purposes. The translation model may give either exact ranslations orincorrect but related words. Even though these words are not correct in the sense of translation, they are very possibly related to the subject of the query and thus helpful for IR purposes. The dictionary-based approach expands a query along another dimension. It gives all the possible translations for each word including those that are missed by the translation model@@@@@4.2 Comparison Wi th  MT Systems One advantage of a parallel text-based translation model is that it is easier to build than an MT system@@@@@Now that we have examined the CLIR performance of the translation model, we will compare it with two existing MT systems. Both systems were tested in E-C CLIR@@@@@4.2.1 Sunshine WebTran Server Using the Sunshine WebTran server (Anonymous, 1999b), an online Engiish-Chinese MT system, to translate the 54 English queries, we obtained an average precision of 0.2001, which is 50.3% of the mono-lingual precision. The precision is higher than that obtained using the translation model (0.1804) or the dictionary (0.1427) alone, but lower than the precison obtained using them together (0.2232)@@@@@4.2.2 Transperfect Kwok (1999) investigated the CLIR performance ofan English-Chinese MT software called Transperfect, using the same TREC Chinese collection as we used in this study. Using the MT software alone, Kwok achieved 56% of monolingual precision. The precision is improved to 62% by refining the translation with a dictionary. Kwok also adopted pretranslation query expansion, which further improved the precison to 70% of the monolingual results@@@@@In our case, the best E-C CLIR precison using the translation model (and dictionary) is 56.1%. It is lower than what Kwok achieved using Transperfect, however, the difference is not large@@@@@4.3 Further  Problems The Chinese-English translation model has a fax lower CLIR performance than that of the EnglishFrench model established using the same method (Nie et al, 1999). The principal reason for this is the fact that English and Chinese are much more different than English and French. This problem surfaced in many phases of this work, from text alignment to query translation. Below, we list some further factors affecting CLIR precision@@@@@? The Web-collected corpus is noisy and it is difficult to align English-Chinese t xts. The alignment method we employed has performed more poorly than on English-French alignment. This in turn leads to poorer performance of the translation model. In general, we observe a higher 27 variability in Chinese-English translations than in English-French translations@@@@@? For E-C CLIR, although queries in both languages were provided, the English queries were not strictly translated from the original Chinese ones. For example, A Jg ,~ (human right situation) was translated into human right issue. We cannot expect he translation model to translate issue back to ~ (situation)@@@@@? The training source and the CLIR collections were from different domains. The Web corpus are retrieved from the parallel sites in Hong Kong while the Chinese collection is from Peoples Daily and Xinhua News Agency, which are published in mainland China. As the result, some important erms such as ~$ $ (mostfavored-nation) and --I!! ~ ~ (one-nation-twosystems) in the collection are not known by the model@@@@@5 Summary  The goal of this work was to investigate he feasibility of using a statistical translation model trained on a Web-collected corpus to do English-Chinese CLIR@@@@@In this paper, we have described the algorithm and implementation we used for parallel text mining, translation model training, and some results we obtained in CLIR experiments. Although further work remains to be done, we can conclude that it is possible to automatically construct a Chinese-English parallel corpus from the Web. The current system can be easily adapted to other language pairs. Despite the noisy nature of the corpus and the great difference in the languages, the evaluation lexicons generated by the translation model produced acceptable precision. While the current CLIR results are not as encouraging asthose of English-French CLIR, they could be improved in various ways, such as improving the alignment method by adapting cognate definitions to HTML markup, incorporating a lexicon and/or removing some common function words in translated queries@@@@@We hope to be able to demonstrate in the near future that a fine-tuned English-Chinese translation model can provide query translations for CLIR with the same quality produced by MT systems@@@@@Re ferences  Anonymous. 1999a.

PTMiner is a web-based tool that searches the web for candidate sites that may contain parallel pages. The following is a guide to search engines and how they work: An anchor text is a piece of text that, when clicked on, will take you to another linked page. When searching for a website in English, you may notice that some pages contain links to other websites. We do not have any English parallel texts on our website. The following table shows the search results for the following Web sites: This article describes how to search for parallel texts using the search engines. PTMiner uses a host crawler to crawl documents on a given host. In this tutorial, I will show you how to find parallel pairs between two files. In this paper, we show that the external features of a parailel page, such as its name and path, can be deduced from its internal features.

       "[' In recent years, speech and natural anguage technologies have matured enough to enable the development ofspoken dialogue systems in limited domains. Most existing systems employ dialogue strategies pre-specified during the design phase of the dialogue manager without taking into account characteristics of actual dialogue interactions. More specifically, mixed initiative systems typically employ rules that specify conditions (generally based on local dialogue context) under which initiative may shift from one agent o the other. Previous research, on the other hand, has shown that changes in initiative strategies inhuman-human dialogues can be dynamically modeled in terms of characteristics of the user and of the on-going dialogue (Chu-Carroll and Brown, 1998) and that adaptability of initiative strategies in dialogue systems leads to better system performance (Litman and Pan, 1999). However, no previous dialogue system takes into account these dialogue characteristics or allows for initiative-oriented adaptation of dialogue strategies',\n",
       " 'In this paper, we describe MIMIC, a voice-enabled telephone-based dialogue system that provides movie showtime information, emphasizing its dialogue management aspects. MIMIC improves upon previous ystems along two dimensions. First, MIMIC automatically adapts dialogue strategies based on participant roles, characteristics of the current utterance, and dialogue history. This automatic adaptation allows appropriate dialogue strategies to be employed based on both local dialogue context and dialogue history, and has been shown to result in significantly better performance than non-adaptive systems. Second, MIMIC employs an initiative module that is decoupled from the goal selection process in the dialogue manager, while allowing the outcome of both components ojointly determine the strategies chosen for response generation. As a result, MIMIC can exhibit drastically different dialogue behavior with very minor adjustments o parameters in the initiative module, allowing for rapid development and comparison of experimental prototypes and resulting in general and portable dialogue systems',\n",
       " '2 Adaptive Mixed Initiative Dialogue Management 2.1 Motivation In naturally occurring human-human dialogues, peakers often adopt different dialogue strategies based on hearer characteristics, dialogue history, etc. For instance, the speaker may provide more guidance if the hearer is having difficulty making progress toward task completion, while taking a more passive approach when the hearer is an expert in the domain. Our main goal is to enable a spoken dialogue system to simulate such human behavior by dynamically adapting dialogue strategies during an interaction based on information that can be automatically detected from the dialogue. Figure 1 shows an excerpt from a dialogue between MIMIC and an actual user where the user is attempting to find the times at which the movie Analyze This playing at theaters in Montclair. S and U indicate system and user utterances, respectively, and the italicized utterances are the output of our automatic speech recognizer. In addition, each system turn is annotated with its task and dialogue initiative holders, where task initiative tracks the lead in the process toward achieving the dialogue participants domain goal, while dialogue initiative models the lead in determining the current discourse focus (Chu-Carroll and Brown, 1998). In our information query application domain, the system has task (and thus dialogue) initiative if its utterances provide helpful guidance toward achieving the users domain goal, as in utterances (6) and (7) where MIMIC provided valid response choices to its query intending to solicit a theater name, while the system has 97 dialogue but not task initiative if its utterances only specify the current discourse goal, as in utterance (4). i This dialogue illustrates everal features of our adaptive mixed initiative dialogue manager. First, MIMIC automatically adapted the initiative distribution based on information extracted from user utterances and dialogue history. More specifically, MIMIC took over task initiative in utterance (6), after failing to obtain a valid answer to its query soliciting a missing theater name in (4)',\n",
       " 'It retained task initiative until utterance (12), after the user implicitly indicated her intention to take over task initiative by providing a fully-specified query (utterance (11)) to a limited prompt (utterance (10)). Second, initiative distribution may affect the strategies MIMIC selects to achieve its goals. For instance, in the context of soliciting missing information, when MIMIC did not have task initiative, a simple information-seeking query was generated (utterance (4)). On the other hand, when MIMIC had task initiative, additional guidance was provided (in the form of valid response choices in utterance (6)), which helped the user successfully respond to the systems query. In the context of prompting the user for a new query, when MIMIC had task initiative, a limited prompt was selected to better constrain the users response (utterance (10)), while an open-ended prompt was generated to allow the user to take control of the problem-solving process otherwise (utterances (1) and (13))',\n",

In Section 3, we discuss how this framework was incorporated into the dialogue management component of a spoken dialogue system to allow for automatic adaptation of dialogue strategies. Finally, we outline experiments evaluating the resulting system and show that MIMICs automatic adaptation capabilities resulted in better system performance',\n",
       " '2.2 An Evidential Framework for Modeling Initiative In previous work, we proposed a framework for modeling initiative during dialogue interaction (Chu-Carroll and Brown, 1998). This framework predicts task and dialogue initiative holders on a turn-by-turn basis in humanhuman dialogues based on participant roles (such as each dialogue agents level of expertise and the role that she plays in the application domain), cues observed in the current dialogue turn, and dialogue history. More specifically, we utilize the Dempster-Shafer theory (Shafer, 1976; Gordon and Shortliffe, 1984), and represent the current initiative distribution as two basic probability assignments (bpas) which indicate the amount of support for each dialogue participant having the task and dialogue initiatives. For instance, the bpa mt-cur({S}) =l Although the dialogues we collected in our experiments (Section 5) include cases in which MIMIC has neither initiative, such cases are rare in this application domain, and will not be discussed further in this paper',\n",

This framework was evaluated using annotated dialogues from four task-oriented domains, achieving, on average, a correct prediction rate of 97% and 88% for task and dialogue initiative holders, respectively. In Section 3.2, we discuss how this predictive model is converted into a generative model by enabling the system to automatically detect cues that were previously labelled manually.

MIMICs automatic adaptation capabilities allow it to employ appropriate strategies based on the cumulative ffect of information dynamically extracted from user utterances during dialogue interactions, enabling MIMIC to provide more cooperative and satisfactory responses than existing nonadaptive systems. Furthermore, MIMIC was implemented as a general framework for information query systems by decoupling its initiative module from the goal selection process, while allowing the outcome of both processes to jointly determine the response strategies employed. This feature nables easy modification to MIMICs adaptation behavior, thus allowing the framework to be used for rapid development and comparisons 103 of experimental prototypes of spoken dialogue systems',\n",

       " 'Furthermore, methods have also been proposed to change the dialogue initiative based on various cues (Litman and Pan, 2000; Chu-Carroll, 2000; Lamel et al. , 1999). In some systems (e.g. Chu-Carroll, 2000), user inexperience is countered with initiative shifts towards the system, so that in the extreme case, the system leads the user from one task state to the next. Further details of MIMIC are presented in the relevant sections below, but see (Chu-Carroll, 2000) for a complete overview. Another approach is proposed by Chu-Carroll (2000) who distinguish between task initiatives and discourse initiatives that are identified based on cues. In mixed-initiative systems, as opposed to directed dialog systems, users can influence the dialog flow, and are not restricted to answering system questions in a prescribed format (e.g. Walker 1990, Chu-Carroll 2000).
