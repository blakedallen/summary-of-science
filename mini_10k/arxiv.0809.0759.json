In the past, the focus has mostly been on the magnetic properties of clean surfaces, thin films, and interfaces\nin multilayers1,2,3,4 , but now magnetism of nanostructures is\nemerging as a new subfield with the aim of exploring and\nmodifying the exchange interaction at the nanometer level.\nGiven that the symmetry in the surface area is always reduced\nas compared to the bulk, more attention needs to be given\nto possible additional surface-induced magnetic anisotropy\neffects1,2,5,6,7,8,9,10,11 . Recently, magnetic anisotropy on surfaces studied at the atomic level has become a new focus of interest with potential applications in ultra-dense magnetic data\nstorage. Using scanning tunneling spectroscopy, the magnetic\nanisotropy can be measured on the single-atom level by analyzing the splittings of magnetic excitation peaks as a function of the applied magnetic field8,10 . Magnetic anisotropy\nconstants were found to be very large, often in the meV/atom\nrange5,10,12 .\nSingle magnetic impurity atoms adsorbed on surfaces or\nburied in the near-surface regions can be described using\nquantum impurity models13,14 with anisotropy terms10,15 . The\ndominant anisotropy terms are of the form D(S *n)2 , where n\nis a vector along a privileged axis that is commonly chosen to\nbe the z-axis15,16 . The most important contributions seem to\narise from the local spin-orbit coupling, as the reduced symmetry leads to unequal hybridization of the different d-orbitals\nof the impurity atom17,18 . For an impurity buried in the nearsurface region, D depends on the distance from the surface\nand oscillates in sign18 .\nNumerical calculations and experiments show that the magnetic anisotropy strongly depends on the microscopic details.\nDepending on the impurity species and on the substrate, dif-\n\nferent directions of the privileged axis may be found. Density\nfunctional theory calculation predict, for example, that perpendicular anisotropy is common for single adatoms on metallic surfaces19 .\nSpin-excitation spectroscopy using a scanning tunneling\nmicroscope (STM) has revealed a rich variety of different\nclasses of behavior. For example, for Fe (spin-2) adatom on a\nthin CuN decoupling layer on a Cu surface, the anisotropy is\nnegative with the z-axis in the surface plane, along the direction of nitrogen atoms, while for Mn (spin-5/2) on the\nsame surface, the anisotropy is weaker but with an out-ofplane z-axis, however D is still negative10. No anomalies at\nthe Fermi level (surface Kondo effect20,21,22,23,24 ) are observed\nfor D < 010 . For Co (spin-3/2) on CuN layer, the anisotropy\nD is positive and signatures of the Kondo effect are observed\nin tunneling spectra25 . These results strongly motivate a study\nof the entire family of the Kondo impurity models for various\nvalues of spin and for different signs and magnitudes of the\nmagnetic anisotropy. Due to the low symmetry at the surface,\nit appears sufficient as a first approximation to consider coupling to a single conduction channel (the one with the largest\nexchange coupling constant); it is unlikely that coupling constants to two orthogonal channels would be equal under these\nconditions.\nSimilar impurity models with large anisotropies also appear in the context of single molecular magnets, e.g. Mn12\nor Fe8 . It was possible to attach metallic contacts to these\nmolecules allowing for electron transport measurements26,27 .\nThe molecules exhibit very large spin values (S = 10 for\nMn12 ) and a negative-D axial anisotropy term DSz2 , so that\nground states with two polarized large-spin states are favored\nin the absence of quantum spin tunneling due to the transverse\nanisotropy E(Sx2 \u2212 Sy2 ) terms28,29,30,31 .\n\nSince the ultimate miniaturization limit appears to be storing information in the spin states of single magnetic atoms,\nit is important to study decoherence by possible magnetic\n\n\f2\nscreening effects through nearby conduction electrons (Kondo\neffect), since the goal is to have long-lived large-spin magnetic\nimpurity states. The appropriate model is thus the impurity\nKondo model with additional anisotropy terms that we introduce in Sec. II. In Sec. III we relate these models by means of\nscaling equations to the Kondo models with XXZ anisotropic\nexchange coupling to the conduction band. Numerical renormalization group results are presented in Sec. IV where we\ncompare calculations for S = 1, S = 3/2 and S = 2.\nS = 3/2 is a typical representative for all half-integer-spin\nmodels, S = 2 a typical representative for all integer-spin\nmodels, while S = 1 is a special case with some additional\nfeatures when compared to higher integer spins. We present\nresults both for static properties (magnetic susceptibility, impurity entropy) and for dynamic properties (spectral functions,\ndynamic magnetic susceptibility). This section also contains\na discussion of the various fixed points, focusing on the nonFermi-liquid behavior in the D < 0 models.\nII.\n\nMODEL\n\nA general approach to study the anisotropy effects of adsorbed impurity atoms would start with a multi-orbital Anderson model for the d-orbitals with a suitable hybridization\nfunction for the coupling with the substrate and with electronelectron repulsion and Hund coupling parameters extracted,\nfor example, from density functional theory calculations. The\nnext step would then consist of obtaining an effective Kondolike model using a Schrieffer-Wolff transformation. We aim,\nhowever, to explore only the effects due to local magnetic\nanisotropy effects. We thus study a very simplified Kondo\nimpurity model defined by the following Hamiltonian:\nH = Hband + HK + Haniso ,\nX\nHband =\n\u01ebk c\u2020k\u03c3 ck\u03c3 ,\n\n(1)\n\nk\u03c3\n\nHK = Js * S.\n\nHere operators ck\u03c3 describe the conduction band electrons\nwith momentum k and spin \u03c3 \u2208 {\u2191, \u2193}. In numerical calculations, we will for simplicity assume a flat band \u01ebk = W k,\nwhere the dimensionless momentum (energy) k ranges from\n\u22121 to 1 and W is the half-bandwidth; the density of states is\nthus constant, \u03c1 = 1/(2W ). Furthermore, the effective exchange constant J is defined as\n1 X\nJ= 2\nJk,k\u2032 ,\n(2)\nN\n\u2032\nkk\n\nwhere Jk,k\u2032 describe exchange scattering of the conduction\nband electrons on the impurity, and the spin-density of the\nconduction band electrons s is defined as\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n1 X Jk,k\u2032 \u2020\n(3)\nck\u03b1\n\u03c3 \u03b1\u03b1\u2032 ck\u2032 \u03b1\u2032 .\ns=\nN \u2032 \u2032 J\n2\nkk \u03b1\u03b1\n\nIf Jk,k\u2032 \u2261 J is constant, then s can be interpreted as the spindensity of conduction band electrons at the position of the impurity. For an impurity adsorbed on a surface, this clearly\n\nS=1\n\nSz=\u00b11/2\n\n|D|\n\nD>0\n\n|D|\nSz=\u00b12\n\nSz=\u00b13/2\n\nE\n\nSz=\u00b11\n\nE\n\nSz=\u00b13/2\n\nSz=\u00b12\nSz=\u00b11\n\n|D|\nSz=0\n\nSz=0\n\n|D|\n\nSz=\u00b11\n\nSz=\u00b11\n\nE\n\nE\n\nE\nSz=0\n\nD<0\n\nS=2\n\nS=3/2\n\nE\n\n|D|\nSz=\u00b11/2\n\n|D|\nSz=0\n\nFigure 1: (Color online) Energy level diagrams for the anisotropic\nmagnetic impurities with spin 1, 3/2 and 2 as a function of the absolute value of the anisotropy, |D|. Wide (blue) lines represent pairs of\nstates, narrow (red) lines represent non-degenerate states.\n\ncannot be a good approximation as the exchange interaction\nJk,k\u2032 is inevitably anisotropic in the reciprocal space; nevertheless, since we focus mostly on the role of the local magnetic anisotropy terms, we will not pursue this issue in this\nwork. We furthermore assumed that the exchange interaction\nis isotropic in the spin space.\nIn the anisotropy term of the Hamiltonian,\n\u0001\n(4)\nHaniso = DSz2 + E Sx2 \u2212 Sy2 ,\n\nthe first term is the axial magnetic anisotropy, while the second is named the transverse magnetic anisotropy. The axis\nz is by convention chosen such that |D| is maximized, while\naxes xy are oriented so that E > 0. If the axial anisotropy\nterm is negative, D < 0, we call the z axis an easy axis; if,\nhowever, D > 0 the anisotropy is said to be hard-axis (or planar). Axial anisotropy term D leads to the splitting of magnetic levels, Fig. 1. In the case of easy-axis anisotropy, D < 0,\nthe moment tends to be maximal in size with two degenerate states pointing in the opposite directions, i.e. Sz = \u00b1S.\nSince the conduction band electrons can only change the impurity spin by one unit during a spin-flip scattering event, the\nexchange scattering rate is expected to be strongly reduced\nfor large enough |D|. In the case of hard-axis anisotropy,\nD > 0, the single level Sz = 0 is favored for integer\nS and the doublet Sz = \u00b11/2 for half-integer S; in both\ncases, the impurity moment will be compensated at low temperatures, since the doublet can be screened via the conventional spin-1/2 Kondo\u0002 screening. It \u0003should be noted that\nE(Sx2 \u2212 Sy2 ) = E/2 (S + )2 + (S \u2212 )2 term, i.e. the transverse anisotropy, mixes levels with different values of Sz .\nThis term, even when E is small, plays an essential role in\nthe easy-axis case28 ; in the hard-axis case, however, it only\nleads to a small correction.\nThe isotropic Kondo model (i.e. the D = E = 0\nlimit) has been intensively studied by a variety of techniques, such as numerical renormalization group32,33,34,35 ,\nBethe Ansatz36,37,38,39,40,41 , and other methods42,43,44 . These\nstudies have uncovered the physics of underscreening: a single conduction channel can screen at most 1/2 unit of spin, so\nthat at low temperatures the impurity remains magnetic with\na residual spin of S \u2212 1/245 . It was found that for S \u2265 1 the\napproach to the stable Fermi-liquid fixed point is slow (loga-\n\n\f3\nrithmic); this behavior was characterized as that of a singular\nFermi liquid34,35 .\nThe anisotropic Kondo model with D 6= 0 (and with additional anisotropy in the exchange coupling) was studied by\nthe Bethe-Ansatz technique46,47 . It was shown that anisotropy\ncan induce a quantum critical point (i.e. non-Fermi-liquid behavior). The applicability of the Bethe-Ansatz approach is,\nhowever, limited to a set of models with restrained parameters\nthus a direct comparison with the model considered in this\nwork is not possible. Nevertheless, there is qualitative agreement in that we also find a non-Fermi-liquid state for D < 0.\nThe anisotropic Kondo model was also previously studied\nby the numerical renormalization group technique in Refs. 28\nand 29 with the focus on high values of spin S and easy-axis\nanisotropy as appropriate for molecular magnets (we note that\nthe definition of D in the cited works differs in sign from\nours). Where comparisons can be made, our results agree with\ntheirs.\nFinally, we mention that related models and physical effects are also studied in the context of transport spectroscopy\nof quantum dots and impurity clusters. The high conductance in the case of underscreening in spin-1 quantum dots\nand the two-stage Kondo screening were discussed in Refs. 48\nand 49. Furthermore, the two-stage Kondo screening is also\nfound in the case of a single conduction channel in multiplequantum-dot structures, in particular in the case of sidecoupled quantum dots50,51,52,53 . High-spin states can be obtained in systems of multiple impurities if the conductionband-mediated exchange interaction is ferromagnetic54,55 ,\nwhich may occur for small inter-impurity separations. Twostage Kondo screening and the closely related \"singlet-triplet\"\nKondo effect56,57,58,59,60,61 have both been intensively studied\nexperimentally62,63,64,65,66,67 .\nIII. SCALING ANALYSIS\n\nThere is a close relation68,69 between the Kondo model with\nthe DSz2 magnetic anisotropy term and the Kondo model with\nthe XXZ anisotropic exchange constants Jz and J\u22a5 69,70,71,72,73\ndefined by the Hamiltonian\nHK = Jz sz Sz + J\u22a5 (sx Sx + sy Sy ) .\n\n(5)\n\nTo be specific, we consider here the S = 1 anisotropic Kondo\nmodel with both types of the anisotropy (XXZ exchange and\nthe DSz2 term, but E = 0). Taking into account that the energy of the Sz = \u00b11 intermediate states is higher by D as\ncompared with the energy of the Sz = 0 state, the following\nscaling equations are obtained68,69,70\ndjz\n1 2\n=\nj ,\n(6)\ndl\n1\u2212d \u22a5\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n1\ndj\u22a5\n1+\nj\u22a5 jz ,\n(7)\n=\ndl\n2\n1+d\n\u0001\ndd\n2\n.\n(8)\n= d \u2212 ln 2 jz2 \u2212 j\u22a5\ndl\nHere the scaling parameter is l = \u2212 ln W ; it runs from 0 to\npositive infinity as the energy scale is reduced. Note that here\n\nwe denote the half-bandwidth by W (this departs from the\nNRG convention of denoting it by D). We have introduced\ndimensionless running coupling constants by absorbing the\ndensity of states \u03c1: j\u22a5 = \u03c1J\u22a5 , jz = \u03c1Jz , while d is measured in the units of W : d = D/W . These scaling equations\ndiffer from those in Ref. 69 only by the d-dependent factors\nin Eqs. (6) and (7), which arise due to the energy shift by D\nin the Sz = \u00b11 states.\nFrom Eq. (8) it follows that d will rapidly grow in absolute\nvalue69 , since the d term on the right hand side is first order,\n2\nwhile the jz2 and j\u22a5\nterms are second order, hence smaller.\nThe importance of the axial anisotropy is thus always reinforced at lower energy scales. Furthermore, starting from initially equal bare coupling constants, jz = j\u22a5 , a non-zero d induces XXZ exchange anisotropy by unequal renormalization\nof jz and j\u22a5 , as seen from Eqs. (6) and (7). At low energy\nscales, the physical properties are qualitatively the same irrespective of the origin of the anisotropy. From Eq. (8) we may\nalso anticipate that the D > 0 case corresponds to a J\u22a5 > Jz\nexchange anisotropic Kondo model, while the D < 0 case to\na J\u22a5 < Jz model69 .\n\nIV. NUMERICAL RESULTS\n\nCalculations were performed using the numerical renormalization group technique13,14,32,33,74,75 which consists of a\nlogarithmic discretization of the continuum of states of the\nconduction band electrons, followed by mapping to a onedimensional chain Hamiltonian with exponentially decreasing\nhopping constants. This Hamiltonian is then diagonalized iteratively by taking into account one new lattice site at each\niteration. We have used discretization parameter \u039b = 2.5\n(\u039b = 2 for spectral function calculations) and truncation with\nthe energy cutoff at Ecutoff = 10\u03c9N , where \u03c9N is the characteristic energy scale at the N -th iteration step. As a further precaution, truncation is always performed in a \"gap\" of\nwidth at least 0.01\u03c9N , so as not to introduce systematic errors. To prevent spurious polarization of the residual impurity\nspin in the D < 0 case due to floating-point round-off errors, it is helpful to symmetrize the energies of states which\nshould be exactly degenerate (i.e. the \u00b1Sz pairs). In all calculations, we have taken explicitly into account the conservation\nof charge Q; in calculations with only the DSz2 anisotropy\nterm (E = 0), a further conserved quantum number is Sz .\nIn all calculations we set \u03c1J = 0.1, therefore the Kondo\n(0)\ntemperature in the isotropic case, TK , is the same for all val37,44,54,76\n74,75\nues of spin S\nand given by\n:\n(0)\n\nTK \u2248 W\n(0)\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\np\n1\n= 1.4 \u00d7 10\u22125 W.\n\u03c1J exp \u2212\n\u03c1J\n\n(9)\n\nExtracting TK directly from the NRG results we obtain a\n(0)\nmore accurate value of TK = 1.16 \u00d7 10\u22125 W . (We use Wilson's definition of the Kondo temperature37,74,77 .)\n\n\f4\nA. Static properties\n\nWe first consider the static (thermodynamic) properties, in\nparticular the impurity contribution to the magnetic susceptibility, \u03c7imp , and the impurity contribution to the entropy,\nSimp . The first quantity, when multiplied by the temperature,\nis a measure of the effective magnetic moment at a given temperature scale, while the second provides information about\nthe effective impurity degrees of freedom.\nIn Fig. 2 we plot the thermodynamic properties of the\nanisotropic Kondo model with the axial DSz2 term (E = 0) for\nthree different values of the impurity spin S and for a range of\nthe anisotropy strength. As long as the temperature is larger\nthan the anisotropy D, the curves follow closely the results\nfor the isotropic case (black curves). At lower temperatures,\nthe behavior of the system strongly depends on the sign of\nD. For negative D (easy-axis case), the impurity spin remains\npartially unscreened at low temperatures; for small |D|, the effective moment is slightly above the isotropic strong-coupling\nfixed-point value with spin S \u2212 1/2 [i.e. \u03bc = (S 2 \u2212 1/4)/3]\nand it saturates with increasing |D| at the value of \u03bc = S 2 .\nThe low-temperature impurity entropy is ln 2 for all negative\nD. This suggests that the impurity behaves as a residual twolevel system with states |+i and |\u2212i, which in the large-|D|\nlimit become equal to the |Sz = +Si and |Sz = \u2212Si states.\nThe scattering of the low-energy electrons on this residual impurity states is discussed in App. A. For spin S > 1, the\neffective moment always increases as the temperature T is\ndecreased below |D|, which reflects the progressive freezing\nout of the magnetic levels other than the maximally aligned\nSz = \u00b1S states. For spin 1, this is still the case for large\nenough |D|, but for lower |D| the temperature dependence\nbecomes monotonic. The boundary between the two differ(0)\nent behaviors can be approximately located at |D| \u223c TK .\n(0)\nThe reason appears to be that for |D| < TK , the S = 1\nKondo effect had already significantly screened the impurity\nspin yielding a residual spin 1/2 by the time the anisotropy\nbegins to be felt; the only effect of the anisotropy is then to\nprevent the screening process from completing, which gives a\nresidual spin value slightly above 1/2.\nFor positive D (hard-axis case), the impurity is nonmagnetic at low temperatures for any value of the impurity\nspin S. Unlike in the easy-axis case, we see a larger variety of\npossible behaviors in the approach to the fixed point depending on the spin and on the anisotropy strength. We discuss\nS = 3/2 and S = 2 first; these are characteristic representatives for all half-integer and integer spin cases.\n(0)\n\nFor half-integer spin and small D < TK , the curves just\nfollow the results for the isotropic case until T \u223c D, when\nspin states other than the Sz = 0 state of the residual (integer!) S \u2212 1/2 impurity spin freeze out and the system approaches the non-magnetic ground state exponentially fast.\n(0)\nFor sufficiently large D > TK , the high |Sz | states of the\noriginal impurity spin freeze out exponentially fast at T \u223c D,\nthis time yielding a Sz = \u00b11/2 doublet which then undergoes spin-1/2 Kondo screening. It must be stressed, however, that after the high-|Sz | states are frozen out, the effec-\n\ntive model in the restrained Sz = \u00b11/2 subspace does not\ncorrespond to an isotropic spin-1/2 model, but rather to an\nexchange anisotropic spin-1/2 model with\nJ\u22a5 \u2248 2J,\n\nJz \u2248 J.\n\n(10)\n\nThe mapping on an anisotropic Kondo model stems from the\nspin-3/2 operators which are given in the matrix notation as\n\u221a\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n3\n0 0\n0\n2\n\u221a\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec 3\n0 1 \u221a0 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec\nSx = \uf8ec 2\n\uf8f7,\n\uf8ed 0 1 0 23 \uf8f8\n\u221a\n0 0 23 0\n(11)\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb3\n0\n0\n0\n2\n\uf8ec0 1 0\n0 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7.\n\uf8ec\nSz = \uf8ed 2\n0 0 \u2212 12 0 \uf8f8\n0 0 0 \u2212 23\n\nIn the Sz = \u00b11/2 subspace, Sz yields 12 \u03c3z , while Sx,y yield\n2 \u00d7 21 \u03c3x,y , i.e. twice the spin-1/2 operators in the transverse\ndirections.

We plot the impurity contribution to the magnetic\nsusceptibility, \u03c7imp , and the impurity contribution to the entropy, Simp . Full (blue) lines correspond to positive anisotropy, D > 0, dashed\n(red) lines correspond to negative anisotropy, D < 0, while black line is the isotropic case, D = 0. The arrow indicate in which direction the\nanisotropy is increasing. Note that the vertical axis in the upper panels is additionally rescaled as 1/S(S + 1).\n\nJ\u22a5 = (S + 1/2)J.\n\n(15)\n\nFor integer S \u2265 2, the situation is the opposite. Now the\nregime of the exponential approach to the Sz = 0 ground\n(0)\n(0)\nstate corresponds to D > TK . For D < TK , on the other\nhand, the low-temperature behavior is again that of the spin1/2 Kondo model. This is made possible by the combined\neffect of the spin-S Kondo screening at higher temperatures\ngiving rise to the S \u2212 1/2 (i.e. half-integer) residual impurity\nspin, and of the axial anisotropy which leads to freezing out\nof the high-spin Sz = \u00b1(S \u2212 1/2), . . ., \u00b13/2 levels of this\nresidual object to finally give rise to a residual spin-1/2 object. This residual spin-1/2 then finally undergoes a spin-1/2\nKondo screening. At first sight it might even seem surprising that the residual spin is compensated at all, given that in\nthe isotropic high-spin Kondo model the residual exchange\ninteraction is ferromagnetic, yet for D > 0 the induced exchange anisotropy (see Sec. III) is of the type which leads to\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n10\n\nTK/W\n\nout. The intrinsic anisotropy of the effective spin-1/2 Kondo\nmodel also plays a role in the splitting (shifting) of the Kondo\nresonance in a magnetic field: for strong magnetic field Bz\nin the z-direction, we expect a shift of \u223c g\u03bcB Bz , and a\nshift approximately twice as large for fields in the transverse\ndirections25 . Finally, we note that for larger spin values we\nhave J\u22a5 = 3J (spin 5/2), J\u22a5 = 4J (spin 7/2), and in general\n\n-5\n\n10\n\n-6\n\n10\n\n\u03c1Jz=0.1\n\n-7\n\n10\n\nS=1/2 XXZ anisotropic model\n\n-8\n\n10\n\n1\n\nJ\u22a5/Jz\n\n2\n\n3\n\nFigure 3: The Kondo temperature of the XXZ anisotropic S = 1/2\nKondo model as a function of the J\u22a5 /Jz ratio.\n\ncomplete screening of the impurity spin68 . Since the residual\n(S \u2212 1/2) spin is an extended object, there is no simple mapping on the effective spin-1/2 Kondo model and it appears\ndifficult to estimate the effective exchange constants J\u22a5 and\nJz even in the D \u2192 0 limit. The effective bandwidth on the\nother hand is clearly given by Weff = \u03b1D, where \u03b1 is some\nconstant of order 1. The Kondo temperature is thus given\nby TK (S = 1/2) \u2248 Df (D), where f (D) turns out to be a\n\n\f\u03c1J=0.1\n(0)\n-5\nTK =1.4 10 W\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n10\n\n-8 slope 1.5\n10 slope 1.7\n\n10\n\n-12\n\n10\n\nslope 2.3\n\n-14\n\n10\n\n-8\n\n10\n\n-7\n\n10\n\nJ\u22a5<Jz \u2194 D<0\n\n1/4\n\n1/8\n\n0.5\n0.8\n0.9\n1\n1.05\n1.1\n1.2\n1.5\n\n0\nln3\n\n\u03c1Jz=0.1\n\n-5\n\nTK =1.4 10 W\n\nln2\nS=1\n\n-6\n\n10\n\n-5\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n10\nD/W\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n0 -12\n10\n\nFigure 4: (Color online) The cross-over temperature (indentified with\n(0)\nthe spin-1/2 Kondo temperature TK for D < TK ) in integer-spin\nanisotropic Kondo models for the hard-axis case.\n\nWe would like to emphasize the important fact that the original impurity spin S and the residual spin S \u2212 1/2 after the\nKondo screening belong to different classes (one is integer,\nthe other half-integer). For this reason we always find differ(0)\nent behavior depending on which of the D and TK is smaller.\nFurthermore, this explains similarities between integer S for\n(0)\n(0)\nD < TK and half-integer S for D > TK .\nFinally we consider the special case of integer spin 1. For\n(0)\nlarge D > TK , the behavior is the same as for other inte(0)\nger spins. For small D < TK , the approach to the strongcoupling fixed point is of the spin-1/2 Kondo model type.\n(2)\nHowever, we find that the second Kondo temperature TK de(0)\npends exponentially on the D/TK ratio, see Fig. 4, a situation strongly reminiscent of the two-stage Kondo screening78\n(0)\nin the side-coupled impurity systems50,51,52,53,79 . At TK the\nspin is screened from S = 1 to S = 1/2 by the spin-1 Kondo\n(2)\neffect, then at TK from S = 1/2 to S = 0 by the spin-1/2\nKondo effect.

We consider both the case when E is large\n[subfigure a) with E = 0.2|D|; such ratio is found, for example, for integer spin-2 Fe impurities on CuN/Cu surfaces\nwhere D = \u22121.5 meV and E = 0.3 meV, and for halfinteger spin-5/2 Mn impurities on the same surface10 ] and\nfor the case where E is much lower than |D| [subfigure b)\nwith E = 0.01|D|; no such magnetic adatom/surface system\nhad been identified so far in the negative-D systems, but E\nappears to be much smaller than D in the positive-D Co on\nCuN/Cu system].\nThe ground state for E 6= 0 is non-degenerate for all parameters. For D > 0, the Sx2 \u2212 Sy2 operator is an irrelevant\nperturbation and the thermodynamic behavior of the system\nis hardly affected. For D < 0, however, the perturbation is\nrelevant and drives the system to a different, non-magnetic\nground state for all S. For S = 1, the degeneracy is lifted\n(0)\n(0)\non the scale of E if E > TK ; for E < TK there appears\nto be Kondo-like screening of the residual spin-1/2 with exponential reduction of the second Kondo temperature, similar\nto what happens in the D > 0 case. Thus the E-term can\ninduce two-stage Kondo behavior even in the D < 0 case.\nFor half-spin S = 3/2, the degeneracy is again lifted on the\n(0)\n(0)\nscale of E if E < TK . If E > TK , previously known\nKondo effect with pseudo-spin 1/2 occurs28 ; the Kondo temperature depends on parameters in a non-trivial way. For integer spin S = 2, we find degeneracy lifting on the scale of E if\n(0)\n(0)\nE > TK , and a pseudo-spin 1/2 Kondo effect if E < TK .\nThe effective bandwidth is now given by Weff = \u03b1E, where\n\u03b1 is some constant of order 1, so the Kondo temperature is\n\n\f7\ngiven by TK \u2248 Ef (D, E) where f (D, E) has power-law behavior as a function of D with a D/E (and spin S) dependent\nexponent, see Fig. 7.\nWe conclude that the easy-axis systems with transverse\nanisotropy behave rather similarly to hard-axis systems; in\nthe conditions for the emergence of the pseudo-spin S = 1/2\nKondo effect the quantity E takes the place of D.\nB.\n\nelectron spectrum with some intermediate phase shift with additional splitting due to residual exchange interaction; as |D|\nis swept from 0 to +\u221e, the (spin-dependent) phase shift is\nreduced from \u03c0/2 to 0, while the nature of the residual impurity spin changes from isotropic spin-1/2 doublet to the\nanisotropic Sz = \u00b11 magnetic doublet, and the residual exchange constants increase from 0 to some finite value of the\norder of the bare exchange coupling J, see also App. A.\n\nProperties of the D < 0 systems\nC.\n\nFor any S \u2265 1 and D < 0, E = 0, the ground state is\ntwofold degenerate. The fixed-point spectra depend on the\nvalue of D, thus the Sz2 term is a marginal operator. At low\ntemperatures, these systems have a Curie-like magnetic response with fractional spin\n\u03c7imp (T \u2192 0) = (g\u03bcB )2\n\nC(D)\n.\nkB T\n\n(18)\n\nThis is reminiscent of the fractional-spin non-Fermi-liquid\nfixed points in the pseudo-gap Kondo model with \u03c1(\u03c9) \u223c |\u03c9|r\ndensity of states for spin 1 and r > 080,81,82,83 and in the related power-law Kondo model in the case of ferromagnetic\ncoupling and r < 084 . There are nevertheless some notable\ndifferences. The fixed points in the pseudo-gap Kondo model\nare found to be unstable with respect to the particle-hole symmetry breaking. The fixed points we find are, however, stable with respect to particle-hole symmetry breaking: both\nanisotropy, Sz2 , and potential scattering, nf0 , are marginal operators. Furthermore, the fixed point in the anisotropic Kondo\nmodel has entropy ln 2 (i.e. impurity behaves as a two-level\nsystem), while the fixed point in the pseudo-gap Kondo model\nhas entropy (1 + 2r) ln 280,81 .\nIn Fig. 8 we plot the Curie constant as a function of the\n(0)\nD/TK ratio. The transition from the isotropic limit\nC = (S \u2212 1/2)(S + 1/2)/3 = (S 2 \u2212 1/4)/3,\n\n(19)\n\nto the saturated easy-axis anisotropic behavior,\nC = S2,\n\n(20)\n\nis approximately logarithmic, i.e. very slow. This reflects the\nunderlying underscreened Kondo effect and the partial screening of the impurity moment which also feature similarly slow\nlogarithmic dependence of the magnetic susceptibility on temperature and magnetic field.\nIn Fig. 9 we plot the energy levels of the spin-1 negativeD model as a function of the anisotropy D. For small |D|,\nthe levels approach the free electron spectrum with \u03c0/2 phase\nshift (which is due to the Kondo effect) with additional twofold degeneracy of all levels due to the decoupled spin-1/2\nresidual impurity spin. For large |D|, the levels tend towards\na spectrum with states clustered near the energies of the free\nelectron spectrum with zero phase shift (no Kondo effect) with\nadditional splitting due to residual anisotropic exchange coupling that will be studied in App. A. For intermediate |D|,\nthe spectrum is more complex. It can be characterized as free\n\nDynamic properties\n\nTo characterize dynamic properties of the anisotropic\nmodels, we calculate the T-matrix and the dynamical spin\nsusceptibility85,86,87,88 .

For S = 1 and\n(0)\nD < TK , this can be explained by the two-stage Kondo\nscreening: the first S = 1 screening stage leads to increased\n\n\f9\n\n2\n\nE\u039b\n\n(N-1)/2\n\n\u03be\n\n3\n\nS=1, D<0, \u03c1J=0.1\nN=80, \u039b=2.5\n\n1\n\nFree electrons, even\nFree electrons, odd\n\n0\n\n-6\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\n|D|/W\n\n0\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\nFigure 9: (Color online) Energy levels at iteration N = 80 (T \u223c\n10\u221216 W ) as a function of the anisotropy D in the spin-1 Kondo\nmodel with easy-axis anisotropy, D < 0.\n\nconductance as in the isotropic case, however the conduc(2)\ntance drops to zero at a lower temperature scale TK when\nthe residual spin-1/2 is compensated in the second screening stage. This is similar to the screening of a S = 1 impurity by two conduction channels with unequal exchange\nconstants42,63 , but here the two-stage screening occurs with\na single channel. Non-monotonous energy-dependence of the\nspectral function is also found in the case of side-coupled impurities, but there both screening stages are of the S = 1/2\n(0)\nkind50,51,52,53 . For large D > TK , the anisotropy makes the\nimpurity non-magnetic, there is no exchange scattering at energy scales below D and the low-temperature conductance\ndrops to zero. Note that in both cases the stable fixed point\n(0)\nis the same, the ratio D/TK merely determines by which\nmechanism the S = 1 Kondo screening is interrupted by the\nanisotropy; the transition between the two regimes is smooth.\nFor higher integer spins (represented in Fig. 10 by the\nS = 2 case), the situation is in some respect similar. For\n(0)\nD < TK , the conductance at first increases during the initial\nspin-S Kondo screening, there is even a slight bump above the\nresult for the isotropic case on the energy scale of D when the\neffective spin doublet is formed and there is additional resonantly enhanced scattering. Spin-S Kondo screening yields a\nhalf-integer effective impurity spin, thus a spin-1/2 doublet\non the energy scale D. The spin-1/2 Kondo screening then\nleads to a decrease in conductance to zero. As previously discussed, the main difference from the S = 1 case is that there\n(0)\nis no exponential reduction of the energy scale for D < TK .\nFor half-integer spins (represented in Fig. 10 by the S =\n3/2 case), the conductance at low temperatures is unitary, as\n(0)\nin the isotropic case. For D > TK , this may be explained by\nthe fact that the anisotropy leads in this case to a low-laying\ndoublet formed by the Sz = \u00b11/2 magnetic doublet which\nundergoes Kondo screening like in the conventional spin-1/2\nKondo model. The doublet is formed before the spin-S Kondo\nscreening commences and the mapping to the spin-1/2 Kondo\nmodel is a good approximation: the Kondo resonance then has\n\napproximately Lorentzian form. It may be noted that there is\nagain an additional peak in \u03c3(\u03c9) at \u03c9 \u223c D due to resonantly\nenhanced scattering by the Sz \u2192 Sz \u00b1 1 processes. For D <\n(0)\nTK , the conductance curve first follows the logarithmically\nincreasing isotropic spin-S curve, then at D the approach to\nthe unitary limit becomes faster.\nWe emphasize the marked difference between the integer\nspin S = 2 and the half-integer spin S = 3/2 regarding the\nenergy scale where the limiting value of \u03c3total (0 viz. 1) is\napproached: for S = 2, the characteristic frequency decreases\nfaster than linearly with D for small D, while for S = 3/2\nit tends to increase very slowly with D for large D. In both\ncases this behavior is due to the underlying effective S = 1/2\nKondo physics; for S = 2 it implies that the effective exchange constant becomes smaller as D is reduced, while for\nS = 3/2 this is due to the saturation of the effective J\u22a5 /Jz\nratio for large D as already discussed.\nWe now consider the easy-axis D < 0 case. For all S,\nthe conductance is found to saturate at some D-dependent finite value here. This reflects the presence of a residual uncompensated impurity spin which induces scattering at low\ntemperatures which is neither unitary nor zero (these are the\nonly two possibilities compatible with a Fermi-liquid system\nin the presence of the particle-hole symmetry which imposes\nthe restriction \u03b4 \u2261 \u2212\u03b4 mod \u03c0 on the quasiparticle scattering\nphase shift \u03b4, thus \u03b4 = 0 or \u03b4 = \u03c0). This implies that the stable fixed point may be classified as a non-Fermi liquid, which\nis confirmed by the non-vanishing inelastic scattering rate at\nthe Fermi level, see Fig. 11. In the limit |D| \u2192 0, this nonFermi-liquid fixed point evolves continuously into a singular\nFermi-liquid fixed point of the isotropic underscreened Kondo\nmodel. Since the approach to this limit is slow (in particular for S \u2265 3/2), even very small negative axial anisotropy\nwill lead to significantly reduced conductance at low temperatures. In the following we show that this behavior is modified\nby non-zero E (see also Ref. 28). Nevertheless, if E \u226a |D|,\nthere might exist a temperature range where the non-Fermiliquid behaviour is observable.\nWe now consider the imaginary part of the dynamic spin\nsusceptibility S\u03b1\u03b1 (\u03c9). We recall that these quantities are\ngiven at zero temperature by\n1 1 X\nS\u03b1\u03b1 (\u03c9) = \u2212\n|hi|S\u03b1 |jGS i|2 \u03b4 (\u03c9 \u2212 (Ei \u2212 EGS ))\n\u03c0 ZN i,j\nGS\n\n(26)\nwhere the index i runs over the excited states and the index\njGS over the degeneracy of the ground state, while ZN is the\nzero-temperature partition function (equal to the degeneracy\nof the ground state). In the absence of the coupling to the\nconduction band, the transverse susceptibility Sxx (\u03c9) features\ndelta peak(s) at\n\u03c9 = |DSz2 \u2212 D(Sz \u2212 1)2 | = |D(2Sz \u2212 1)|,\n\n(27)\n\nsince Sx couples neighboring levels. For S = 1, there is thus\na peak at |D|, for S = 3/2 a peak at 2|D| and for S = 2,\ndepending on the sign of D, a peak at D (for D > 0) or at\n3|D| (for D < 0).

We plot the spectral function of the T -matrix (\"conductance\")\nand the longitudinal and transversal dynamical suspectibility Szz (\u03c9) and Sxx (\u03c9). The curves correspond to |D| = 10\u22122 , . . . , 10\u22126 ; the curve\nstyles are the same as in Fig. 2. Note that for S = 2 and D = 10\u22126 the susceptibility curves do not diverge; they start decreasing at an energy\nscale outside the displayed range.\n\nThe S = 1 case has some special features, so we focus first\non the regular cases, S \u2265 3/2. The longitudinal susceptibility\nSzz (\u03c9) always has a single peak. In the hard-axis D > 0 case\nwe find that the peak occurs at the energy scale of the effec(0)\ntive S = 1/2 Kondo effect (when it occurs, i.e. D > TK\n(0)\nfor S = 3/2 and D < TK for S = 2, respectively) or at\n\u223c D in the regime with no S = 1/2 Kondo effect. In both\ncases this corresponds to the energy scale where the conductance approaches its limiting value, as discussed above. This\nresult is expected, since in the presence of the Kondo effect\nthe largest magnetic fluctuations always occur on the energy\nscale of TK , which is a reflection of the anomalously strong\nspin-flip scattering of the conduction band electrons off the\nimpurity; in the absence of the Kondo effect, magnetic fluctuations occur on the scale of the local magnetic excitation\nenergy, in this case the anisotropy D. In the easy-axis D < 0\ncase, the position of the peak in Szz (\u03c9) is always \u223c |D|.\n\nFor all D and all S \u2265 3/2, the approach to the zero frequency limit is linear, while the behavior at high frequencies\nis described approximately by a power law S(\u03c9) \u223c \u03c9 \u2212\u03b3 with\nexponents \u03b3 that are slightly above 173 .\nThe transverse susceptibility Sxx (\u03c9) is more complex. In\n\nthe hard-axis D > 0 case, we find a two-peak behavior in the\nparameter regime with S = 1/2 Kondo effect: the first peak\ncorresponds to the scale of D, the second to the scale of TK .\n(0)\nIn the transition regime D \u223c TK , the two peaks merge into\na single peak which then follows the scale of anisotropy D.\nIn the easy-axis D < 0 case, the curves again have a single\npeak at \u223c |D|. At this point a comment on the peak width\nis in order: the peaks at \u223c |D| are over-broadened due to the\nbroadening procedure used in the NRG method, thus the very\nnarrow peaks take the form of the broadening kernel96 .\nWe now finally turn to S = 1. For hard-axis D > 0\nanisotropy, we find for both Szz (\u03c9) and Sxx (\u03c9) a single peak\n(0)\n(2)\ncentered at \u03c9 \u223c D (for D > TK ) or at \u03c9 \u223c TK (for\n(0)\nD < TK ). In Sxx (\u03c9), there is no additional peak on the scale\n(0)\nof D for D < TK , as was the case for the spin-2 model, but\n(0)\nwe observe a change of slope at \u03c9 \u223c TK . Even more peculiar are the results for the easy-axis D < 0 case. The longitudinal susceptibility has a linear frequency dependence for\n(0)\n(0)\n|D| & TK , but for |D| . TK we observe \u03c9 \u03b1 scaling with\nexponent \u03b1 which depends on the anisotropy D and which\n(0)\nturns negative approximately at |D| \u223c TK , i.e. the suscep-\n\n\f11\n1\n\n\u03c3/\u03c30\n\n0,8\n\nD=0\n\nwisdom that a single channel can screen at most 1/2 unit of\nspin, which results in a residual spin of S \u2212 k/2 in the case of\nk screening channels: such a behavior will only be observable\nfor isotropic systems, a situation which is rather unlikely for\nmagnetic impurities adsorbed on surfaces.\n\ntotal\nelastic\ninelastic\n\n0,6\n0,4\n0,2\n0\n\n\u03c3/\u03c30\n\n0,8\n\n-5\n\nS=1\n\nD=10 W\n\n0,6\n\n\u03c1J=0.1\n\n0,4\n\nTK =1.4 10 W\n\n(0)\n\n-5\n\n0,2\n0\n\n\u03c3/\u03c30\n\n0,8\n0,6\n\n-5\n\nD=-10 W\n\n0,4\n0,2\n0\n-12\n10\n\n-9\n\n10\n\n-6\n\n10\n\u03c9/W\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\nFigure 11: (Color online) Total, elastic and inelastic scattering cross\nsections for the S = 1 Kondo model with no anisotropy, positive\nanisotropy and negative anisotropy.\n\ntibility becomes divergent. In the transverse susceptibility we\nfind a strong deviation from linear scaling for all values of\n|D|, with divergent behavior already for |D| much larger than\n(0)\nTK . We emphasize that for all spin values S, the easy-axis\nD < 0 systems exhibit non-Fermi-liquid features (such as finite inelastic scattering at \u03c9 = 0), but only for S = 1 is the\ndynamic spin susceptibility divergent at low frequencies.\nWe note that a linear frequency dependence of S\u03b1\u03b1 (\u03c9) at\nlow frequencies must hold in Fermi-liquid systems as mandated by the Korringa-Shiba relations72,96,97,98 . For D < 0 the\nsystem is, however, non-Fermi liquid and the static magnetic\nsusceptibility is diverging for all S, thus S(\u03c9) is not expected\nto be linear. We view the fact that it is linear for S \u2265 3/2\nmerely as a coincidence.\nWe finish our discussion of dynamic properties by showing\nthat in the presence of the transverse anisotropy term E(Sx2 \u2212\nSy2 ), all non-Fermi-liquid features disappear, Fig. 11. In particular, we observe that for all integer S the low-temperature\nconductance is zero, while for all half-integer S it is unitary,\nirrespective of the sign and size of the axial anisotropy D. Furthermore, the spin susceptibility always has linear frequency\ndependence at low frequencies. This agrees with the results\nfor static properties.\n\nV. CONCLUSION\n\nDue to the presence of the magnetic anisotropy, the impurity spin is always completely compensated at low enough\ntemperature, even in the case of high-spin impurities coupled\nto a single continuum channel. This goes against the common\n\nThe approach to the fully screened impurity spin with decreasing energy scale depends on the impurity spin S, the\nsign of axial anisotropy D, and on the hierarchy of the energy\n(0)\n(0)\nscales, in particular on the dichotomy D < TK or D > TK\nin the positive-D models. For positive D (hard-axis case),\nwe find spin-1/2 Kondo screening at low temperatures in the\n(0)\nweak-anisotropy case D < TK for integer spin (with exponentially reduced Kondo temperature in the special case of\n(0)\nspin 1) and in the strong-anisotropy case D > TK for halfinteger spin; in other cases, the effective impurity moment\ndrops to zero exponentially on the energy scale of D. The\ntransverse anisotropy E does not play an important role for\nD > 0. For negative D (easy-axis case), however, it changes\nthe behavior of the system completely. For E = 0, the impurity spin would be only partially screened, leading to residual\nspin-dependent scattering and non-Fermi-liquid behavior. In\nreal systems E 6= 0 and the behavior of D < 0 becomes similar to that of the D > 0 systems: for S = 1 we again find\n(0)\ntwo-stage Kondo screening for E < TK , for S = 3/2 there\n(0)\nis effective spin-1/2 Kondo effect for E > TK , while for\n(0)\nS = 2 we find effective spin-1/2 screening for E < TK .\nIf E \u226a |D|, some features of the non-Fermi-liquid behavior\nmight be observable in intermediate temperature respectively\nenergy regimes. The zero-temperature conductance is found\nto be zero for all integer spins and unitary for all half-integer\nspins for both signs of D (assuming E 6= 0). For integer spin\n(0)\nand E, D < TK , the temperature dependence of the conductance is expected to be non-monotonous with increased\n(0)\nconductance in the TK (S = 1/2) < T < TK range. The\nmost likely candidate for observation of underscreening is the\nS = 1 case due to the exponential reduction of the second\nKondo temperature, which is a special feature of the S = 1\nmodel and is not found for other integer spins.\nWe conclude by noting that taking the magnetic anisotropy\neffects into account is essential in interpreting scanning tunneling spectra of magnetic impurities measured at low temperatures (T \u226a |D|). The appropriate low-temperature effective impurity model depends on the parameters of the original physical model. While most interpretations of the surface Kondo effect have been based on the Anderson impurity\nmodel (which maps on the isotropic Kondo model), it is more\nlikely that the appropriate effective model is, in fact, some\nanisotropic Kondo model. This is especially true for impurities on decoupling layers, but also applies to impurities adsorbed directly on metallic surface where due to stronger hybridisation charge fluctuation effects also play a role. Appropriate description in terms of an anisotropic model has important consequences on the relation between the Kondo temperature and the \"bare\" model parameters (effective bandwidth,\nexchange constants J\u22a5 and Jz ), and on the coupling of the\neffective impurity spin with the external magnetic field.\n\n\f12\n\nS=1\n\nS=3/2\n\nS=2\n\n\u03c3total(\u03c9)/\u03c30\n\n1\n0,8\n\nE=0.2 |D|\n\n\u03c1J=0.1\n\n0,6\n0,4\n0,2\n9\n\n10\nSzz(\u03c9)\n\n6\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n10 9\n10\nSxx(\u03c9)\n\n6\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n10 -12 -9\n-3\n-9\n-6\n10 10 10 10 10\n\u03c9/W\n\n-6\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n10\n\u03c9/W\n\n-12\n\n10\n\n-9\n\n10\n\n-6\n\n-3\n\n10 10\n\u03c9/W\n\n0\n\n10\n\nFigure 12: (Color online) Dynamic properties of the anisotropic Kondo model with the E(Sx2 \u2212 Sy2 ) term.

In other words, there is no decoupling of\nthe residual impurity spin, as in the isotropic S = 1 Kondo\nmodel35 . There is furthermore no effective potential scattering in the |D| \u2192 \u221e limit, since the conduction band electrons\ncannot flip the impurity spin due to the high energy barrier,\nthus there can be no quasiparticle phase shift due to Kondo\nscreening. We may thus take the Hamiltonian for the uncoupled conduction band chain35\nHband = \u03be \u22121 \u039b\u2212(N \u22121)/2\n\nX\u0010\nr\n\n\u0011\n(0)\nEp(0) p\u2020r,\u03c3 pr,\u03c3 + Eh h\u2020r,\u03c3 hr,\u03c3 ,\n\n(A1)\nwhere p and h are second quantization operators for particle\n(0)\n(0)\nand hole excitations, while Ep and Eh are their energies in\nthe units of the characteristic energy scale at the N -th NRG\n\n\u221a\niteration, and \u03be = ln \u039b \u039b/(1 \u2212 \u039b\u22121 ) \u2248 2.41 is an additional\nscale factor in the discretization scheme used in this work99 .\nThe fixed-point Hamiltonian can be written as H \u2032 =\nHband + Hc with\n\u2217\nHc = Jz\u2217 sz Sz + J\u22a5\n(sx Sx + sy Sy ) ,\n\n(A2)\n\nwhere si are the spin operators on the first site of the Wilson\nchain,\n\u0013\nX \u2020 \u00121\ni\nsi =\nf0,\u03b1\n(A3)\n\u03c3 \u2032 f0,\u03b1\u2032 ,\n2 \u03b1\u03b1\n\u2032\n\u03b1\u03b1\n\nwhile Si are the impurity spin-1 operators.
