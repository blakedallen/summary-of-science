Nevertheless, the thermodynamics is not understood\nat lower temperature (T ) because of its nonperturbative nature. The thermodynamics is closely related to not only natural phenomena such as compact stars and the early universe\nbut also laboratory experiments such as relativistic heavyion collisions. Lattice QCD (LQCD) is a first-principle calculation, but it has the well-known sign problem when the\nquark-number chemical potential (\u03bcq ) is real; for example,\nsee Ref. [1]. So far, several approaches have been proposed\nto circumvent the difficulty; for example, the reweighting\nmethod [2], the Taylor expansion method [3] and the analytic\ncontinuation from imaginary \u03bcq to real \u03bcq [4\u20137]. However,\nthese are still far from perfection particularly at \u03bcq /T >\n\u223c 1.\nThe success of the approaches is linked to how difficult the\nsign problem is. As a good index of the difficulty, one can\nconsider the average of the phase factor\ne2i\u03b8 =\n\ndet(D + \u03bcq \u03b30 + m)\ndet(D + \u03bcq \u03b30 + m)\u2217\n\n(1)\n\nof the Fermion determinant. If the average of the phase factor\nis much smaller than 1, this means that there are severe cancellations in the path integral of the QCD partition function.\nIn this situation, LQCD simulations are not feasible.\nThe average is obtained by taking the expectation value of\nthe phase factor in the phase-quenched theory in which the\nFermion determinant is replaced by the absolute value. In the\ntwo-flavor case, the average is\nhe2i\u03b8 i =\n\n\u2217 sakai@phys.kyushu-u.ac.jp\n\u2020 sasaki@phys.kyushu-u.ac.jp\n\u2021 kounoh@cc.saga-u.ac.jp\n\u00a7 yahiro@phys.kyushu-u.ac.jp\n\nZ1+1\n,\nZ1+1\u2217\n\n(2)\n\nwhere Z1+1 stands for the partition function of the ordinary\ntwo-flavor theory and Z1+1\u2217 represents that of the two-flavor\nphase-quenched theory in which one of two flavors is changed\ninto a conjugate flavor. For comparison of the 1+1\u2217 system\nwith the 1+1 system, let us introduce the modified isospin\nchemical potential \u03bcI related to the isospin chemical potential \u03bciso as \u03bcI = \u03bciso /2. When the 1+1 system has a value of\n\u03bcq , the 1+1\u2217 system possesses the same value of \u03bcI .\nIt is not easy to calculate the average phase factor with\nLQCD even for small \u03bcq /T . Actually, several LQCD results\non the average phase factor are spotted; see Ref. [11] and references therein. It is then important to make a systematic analysis on the phase factor by using effective theories. This was\ndone by the chiral perturbation theory [8, 9]. The result is consistent with LQCD one [11] when T is lower than the critical\none Tc . However, the theory is not valid for T > Tc .\nRecently, the average phase factor at T > Tc was calculated by the random matrix theory [10] and the Nambu\u2013JonaLasinio (NJL) model [12]. When the saddle-point approximation is applied to the path integrals in the partition functions\nZ1+1 and Z1+1\u2217 , the average phase factor can be described by\np\ndet H1+1\u2217 \u2212\u03b2V (\u03a91+1 \u2212\u03a91+1\u2217 )\n2i\u03b8\ne\n,\n(3)\nhe i \u2248 p\ndet H1+1\n\nwhere \u03b2 = 1/T , \u03a9 is the thermodynamic potential at\nmean field level and H is the Hessian matrix showing\nstatic fluctuations (SF) at the saddle point. The average\nphase factor thus obtained is dominated not by the ex\u2212\u03b2V (\u03a91+1 \u2212\u03a91+1\u2217 )\nponential\nfactor\nbut by the SF factor\np e\np\ndet H1+1\u2217 / det H1+1 [12], because \u03a91+1 = \u03a91+1\u2217 in\nthe normal phase with no pion condensate and the SF factor\nis zero in the pion condensate phase; this will be explained\nexplicitly in subsection II B. Thus, the average phase factor\nshould be calculated with the mean field (MF) approximation\nplus SF corrections. This framework is referred to as MF+SF\nin the present paper.\nThe NJL model describes the chiral phase transition [13\u2013\n18], but not the deconfinement transition. The Polyakovloop extended Nambu\u2013Jona-Lasinio (PNJL) model [19\u201338]\nwas constructed to treat both the transitions simultaneously.\nVery recently, the PNJL model was shown to be successful\n\n\f2\nin reproducing LQCD data for imaginary quark chemical potential [34, 35], imaginary quark and isospin chemical potentials [36] and real isospin chemical potential [38]. Thus, the\nPNJL model is one of the most reliable models.\nIn this paper, we evaluate the average phase factor by the\nPNJL model in the MF+SF framework and investigate a relation between the Polyakov-loop and the average phase factor. For thermal systems at \u03bcI = \u03bcq = 0 and at \u03bcI > 0\nand \u03bcq = 0, the scalar-type eight-quark interaction is essential for the PNJL model to reproduce LQCD data [35, 38].\nWe then analyze an effect of the eight-quark interaction on\nthe average phase factor, too. Finally, we consider dynamical\nmesonic fluctuations (DF), instead of static mesonic fluctuations, to compare the PNJL results with LQCD data.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we recapitulate the PNJL model and a way of calculating the average\nphase factor. The numerical results are shown in Sec. III. Effects of the Polyakov loop, the eight-quark interaction, static\nfluctuations and dynamical mesonic fluctuations are investigated. Section IV is devoted to summary.\n\nFor later convenience, we use \u03bcI instead of \u03bciso and call it\nthe isospin chemical potential simply. The 1+1 and the 1+1\u2217\ntheory correspond to taking (\u03bcq , \u03bcI ) = (\u03bcq , 0) and (0, \u03bcq ),\nrespectively, in L of (4). In the limit of m0 = \u03bcI = 0, the\nPNJL Lagrangian has the SUL (2)\u00d7SUR (2)\u00d7Uv (1)\u00d7SUc (3)\nsymmetry. For m0 6= 0 and \u03bcI 6= 0, it is reduced to UI3 (1) \u00d7\nUv (1) \u00d7 SUc (3).\nThe Polyakov-loop operator \u03a6\u0302 and its Hermitian conjugate\n\u2020\n\u03a6\u0302 are defined as\n\u03a6\u0302 =\n\n1\nTrL,\n3\n\n\u03a6\u0302\u2217 =\n\n1\nTrL\u2020 ,\n3\n\nwith\nh Z\nL(x) = P exp i\n\n0\n\n\u03b2\n\ni\nd\u03c4 A4 (x, \u03c4 ) ,\n\nIn this section, we first explain the PNJL model in the MF\nlevel for the case of finite \u03bcq and \u03bcI and treat SF in order to\nevaluate the average phase factor.\nA.\n\nPNJL model\n\na\n\nwhere D\u03bd = \u2202 \u03bd + iA\u03bd and A\u03bd = \u03b40\u03bd gA0a \u03bb2 with the gauge\nfield A\u03bda , the Gell-Mann matrix \u03bba and the gauge coupling\ng. The coupling constant Gs (Gs8 ) represents a strength\nof the scalar-type four-quark (eight-quark) interaction. The\nPolyakov potential U of (18) is a function of the Polyakov\nloop \u03a6 and its Hermitian conjugate \u03a6\u2217 .\nThe chemical potential matrix \u03bc\u0302 is defined by \u03bc\u0302 =\ndiag(\u03bcu , \u03bcd ) with the u-quark (d-quark) number chemical potential \u03bcu (\u03bcd ), while m\u03020 = diag(m0 , m0 ).

In the limit, the Polyakov potential yields\na first-order deconfinement phase transition at T = T0 . Since\nthe first-order transition takes place at T = 270 MeV in\nLQCD, T0 is often set to 270 MeV in the PNJL calculation.\nIn the light-quark case, however, the PNJL calculation with\nthis value of T0 yields a larger value of Tc than the full LQCD\nprediction Tc = 173 MeV [41\u201343]. Therefore, we rescale T0\nto 200 MeV to reproduce Tc = 173 MeV [35].\na0\n3.51\n\na1\n-2.47\n\na2\n15.2\n\nb3\n-1.75\n\nTABLE I: Summary of the parameter set in the Polyakov-potential\nsector determined in Ref. [25]. All parameters are dimensionless.\n\nIn the NJL sector, two parameter sets are taken; in the\nfirst set Gs8 is finite, while in the second set it is zero. The\nfirst set is \u039b = 0.6315 GeV, Gs = 4.673 [GeV\u22122 ], Gs8 =\n452.12 [GeV\u22128 ] and m0 = 5.5 MeV. This set reproduces not\nonly the pion decay constant f\u03c0 = 93.3 MeV and the pion\nmass m\u03c0 = 139 MeV at vacuum but also LQCD data [41\u201343]\non \u03c3 and |\u03a6| for thermal systems with no \u03bcq and \u03bcI [35]. The\nsecond set is \u039b = 0.6315 GeV, Gs = 5.498 GeV\u22122 , Gs8 = 0\nand m0 = 5.5 MeV. This set can reproduce the pion decay\nconstant and the pion mass at vacuum, but not LQCD data for\nthermal systems with no \u03bcq and \u03bcI . Thus, the first set with\nfinite Gs8 is more reliable.\n\nfor \u03c6 = (\u03c3, ~\u03c0 , \u03c63 , \u03c68 ) rather than \u03c6 = (\u03c3, ~\u03c0 , \u03a6, \u03a6\u2217 ) [25],\nalthough the solutions are not so different between the two\ncases. However, the first case does not guarantee that \u03a9 is\nreal. Following Ref. [25], we then put \u03c68 = 0 to keep \u03a9 real.\nNoting that the first-order derivative with respect to \u03c68 does\nnot vanish, we expand \u03a9 up to quadratic terms of fluctuations:\n\u0012\n\u0012 2\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u03b4\u03a9\n\u03b4 \u03a9\n1\n\u03a9 = \u03a9MF +\n\u03b4\u03c6i \u03b4\u03c6j , (21)\n\u03b4\u03c6i +\n\u03b4\u03c6i MF\n2 \u03b4\u03c6i \u03b4\u03c6j MF\nP\nwhere \u03c6 =\ni \u03b4\u03c6i + \u03c6MF for mean fields \u03c6MF and static\n(constant) fluctuations \u03b4\u03c6i . Since first-order terms in \u03b4\u03c6i are\npurely imaginary, we can regard an integral over \u03b4\u03c6i as a\nFourier integral.

Therefore, the average phase factor is obtained by (3) with \u03a9 replaced by \u03a9\u0303. The average phase factor\nthus obtained is a function of the \u03c6MF that satisfy the stationary conditions (20). Thus, the average phase factor is calculable in the MF+SF framework.\nThe static fluctuations are composed of those of \u03c3 and \u03c0 and\nof \u03c63 and \u03c68 . In subsection III C, we keep treating static fluctuations for \u03c63 and \u03c68 , but consider dynamical fluctuations for\n\u03c3 and \u03c0, that is, \u03c3 and \u03c0 mesons.\nIt was revealed in Ref. [12] with the NJL model that in the\npion condensate phase, where \u03c0MF is finite and then a massless mode appears, the average phase factor vanishes owing\n\n\f4\n\nIII.\n\nNUMERICAL RESULTS\n\ntends to 1. This implies that the NJL model overestimates the\naverage phase factor compared with the PNJL model, since\n\u03a6 = 1 in the NJL model. This is true, as shown below in\nFig. 2.\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\nT[GeV]\n\nto det H1+1\u2217 = 0. Obviously, this is true also for the PNJL\nmodel, as shown in (25). In the normal phase with no pion\ncondensate, \u03a91+1 and \u03a91+1\u2217 are the same in the MF level,\nso thatp\nthe average phase\np factor is determined by only the SF\nfactor det H1+1\u2217 / det H1+1 .\nLQCD calculation in Ref. [6] has a lattice size 163 \u00d7 4.\nHence, the three-dimensional volume is V = (16a)3 for a lattice spacing a and the inverse of temperature is 1/T = 4a.\nThe four-dimensional volume is then obtained by V /T =\n64T \u22124. This four-dimensional volume is taken also for the\nPNJL model in its calculation of the average phase factor.\n\n0.2\n\nPNJL\n\n0.1\n\nA. Average phase factor and Polyakov loop\n\nNJL\n0\n0\n\nSolving the stationary conditions (20) and inserting the solutions in (3), one can obtain \u03a6, \u03c0 and he2i\u03b8 i as a function of\nT and \u03bcq . As a shorthand notation, we use \u03a6 for \u03a61+1 and\n\u03c0 for \u03c01+1\u2217 . All the calculations in this subsection are done\nwithout the scalar-type eight-quark interaction; roles of the\neight-quark interaction will be discussed in subsection III B.\n\n<e\n\n\u03c0/\u03c30\n\n1\n\n2i\u03b8\n\n>\n\n0.5\n\n0\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n\u03a6\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nFig. 1: \u03a6 dependence of the scaled pion condensate \u03c0/\u03c30 and the\naverage phase factor he2i\u03b8 i at \u03bcq = 100 MeV. Here, \u03c30 is a chiral\ncondensate at T = \u03bcq = 0. The former is plotted by a dashed curve,\nwhile the latter is by a solid curve.\n\nIn Fig. 1, we plot (\u03a6(T ), \u03c0(T )) by a dashed line and\n(\u03a6(T ), he2i\u03b8 i(T )) by a solid line, varying T with \u03bcq fixed\nat 100 MeV. Since \u03a6 is an increasing function of T [35], an\nincrease of \u03a6 means that of T . The pion condensate \u03c0 decreases as \u03a6 increases and finally vanishes at a critical value\n\u03a6c of \u03a6. Below \u03a6c , the average phase factor is always zero,\nwhile \u03c0 is finite. Above \u03a6c , inversely, the average phase factor is finite, while \u03c0 is always zero. Thus, there is a negative\ncorrelation between the average phase factor and the pion condensate. This property is also seen in the NJL model [12]. In\ncontrast, there exists a positive correlation between the average phase factor and the Polyakov loop: the average phase\nfactor is zero at small \u03a6 such as \u03a6 < \u03a6c , but at large \u03a6 such\nas \u03a6 > \u03a6c the average phase factor is finite and an increasing\nfunction of \u03a6.

Thus, the fact that \u03a6 < 1 in the PNJL model\nmakes the region wider and the average phase factor smaller\noutside the region. The critical endpoint (CEP) of the firstorder chiral phase transition is also plotted by a cross (\u00d7) for\nthe PNJL model and a plus (+) for the NJL model. For both\nthe models, thus, the CEP and the first-order phase transition\nare in the he2i\u03b8 i = 0 region. This implies that the location\nof CEP cannot be determined by LQCD directly. The CEP is\nlocated at higher T and lower \u03bcq in the PNJL model compared\nwith the NJL model. However, a relative distance of CEP\nto the boundary of the he2i\u03b8 i = 0 region is almost the same\nbetween the two models.\nB. Scalar-type eight-quark inteaction\n\nThe scalar-type eight-quark interaction\nGs8 [(q\u0304q)2 + (q\u0304i\u03b35~\u03c4 q)2 ]2\n\n(26)\n\nis inevitable to reproduce LQCD data at finite real isospin\nchemical potential [38] and zero and finite imaginary quark\nchemical potential [35]. Furthermore, the interaction affects a\nlocation of CEP for real \u03bcq . Therefore, it is important to see\nhow the scalar-type eight-quark interaction affects the average\nphase factor.\nFigure 3 shows \u03bcq dependence of the average phase factor\nat T = 0.9Tc , Tc and 1.1Tc . The solid and dashed lines correspond to the PNJL result with and without the eight-quark\ninteraction. Below Tc such as T = 0.9Tc , the scalar-type\neight-quark interaction does not affect the average phase factor, and at T = Tc the effect becomes appreciable. Above\n\n\f5\nTc such as T = 1.1Tc , it enhances the average phase factor\nsizably.\n\nproportional to the relative distance.

For \u03bcq < m\u03c0 /2, the average phase factor is finite and then calculable with LQCD in principle.

Thus, the relative distance\nof CEP to the boundary becomes much smaller by the scalartype eight-quark interaction, although CEP itself lies in the\nhe2i\u03b8 i = 0 region even after the scalar-type eight-quark interaction is taken into account.

Dynamical mesonic fluctuations\n\nThe average phase factor was calculated with LQCD [6] in\nwhich the lattice size is 163 \u00d7 4 and the pion mass at vacuum\nis mLQCD\n\u2248 280 MeV. In the PNJL calculation, we have then\n\u03c0\nvaried the quark mass from m0 = 5.5 MeV to 22.5 MeV to reproduce mLQCD\n= 280 MeV. For this value of m0 , the decon\u03c0\nfinement transition temperature becomes a bit higher value,\ni.e., Tc = 180 MeV.\n\nMF+SF\nMF+DF\nLQCD\n\nT=0.9Tc\n1\n\nthe 90% confidence level region for the extrapolation, while\nthe MF+SF calculation is represented by dotted lines. The\nMF+SF calculation overestimates LQCD data largely. Therefore, we consider dynamical mesonic fluctuations beyond the\nMF+SF framework.\nBelow Tc where the system is confined, it is natural to\nthink that mesonic modes dominate rather than quark modes.\nTherefore, we should take all possible channels (mesonic\nmodes) in the bubble summation in the random phase approximation (RPA). If there is no pion condensate, \u03c3 and \u03c0 meson\nmodes are decoupled to each other. Hence, the mesonic polarization function matrix does not have off-diagonal elements.\nUp to order 1/Nc , where Nc is the number of colors, the thermodynamic potential is obtained by\n\n<e\n\n2i\u03b8\n\n>\n\n\u03a9 = \u03a9MF + \u03a9DF ,\n0.5\n\n0\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n2\u03bcq/m\u03c0\n1\n\nG\u2217s\u03c3 =\n\n>\n\n2i\u03b8\n\n<e\n\n\u2202M\n\u2202N\n, G\u2217s\u03c0+ = G\u2217s\u03c0\u2212 = G\u2217s\u03c00 =\n,\n\u2202\u03c3\n\u2202\u03c0\n\nand the mesonic polarization bubbles\nZ\nd4 p\nTr[\u0393j\u2217 S(p + q)\u0393k S(p)]\n\u03a0jk (q) = i\n(2\u03c0)4\n\n0.5\n\n0\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n2\u03bcq/m\u03c0\nT=1.25Tc\n2i\u03b8\n\n>\n\n1\n\n<e\n\nwhere \u03a9MF is the mean-field part shown in (16) and \u03a9DF is\nthe dynamical mesonic fluctuation (DF) part in the ring diagram.

The effective action of the NJL-type model to 1/Nc\norder is derivable by using the auxiliary field method [17].\nThe second derivative of the effective action with respect to\nmeson fields yields the inverse meson propagator G\u2217s [1 \u2212\nG\u2217s \u03a0(q)]. Since the static fluctuations are constant, the Hessian matrix (25) is obtained by setting the external momentum\nq = 0 in the inverse propagator:\nH = G\u2217s [1 \u2212 G\u2217s \u03a0(q = 0)].\n\n(31)\n\nSetting q = 0 in (28) reduces \u03a9DF to ln det[H] and the resultant partition function turns out to be (22). Thus, the static\nmesonic fluctuation \u03a9SF = ln det[H] can be regarded as an\napproximation to the dynamical one \u03a9DF .\nNow we introduce the effective meson mass m\u2217j which satisfy\ndet[1 \u2212 G\u2217s \u03a0(q0 + \u03bcj = m\u2217j , q = 0)] = 0\n\n(32)\n\nwith the meson chemical potentials \u03bc\u03c3 = \u03bc\u03c00 = 0, \u03bc\u03c0+ =\n2\u03bcI and \u03bc\u03c0\u2212 = \u22122\u03bcI . Here note that physical meson masses\n\n\f7\nare not m\u2217j but mj = m\u2217j \u2212 \u03bcj because they are calculated\nfrom q0 .\nSince it is difficult to calculate the dynamical mesonic fluctuations (28) exactly, here we make the pole approximation\nthat neglects the scattering phase shift. If T < Tc and there\nis no pion condensation, m\u2217j is well approximated by the meson mass m0j at vacuum. In this approximation, \u03a9DF can be\nobtained by a sum of four quasiparticles, \u03c3, \u03c0 + , \u03c0 \u2212 and \u03c0 0 :\nX\n\u03a9j ,\n(33)\n\u03a9DF =\nj\n\n\u0014\n\u0011\u0015\n\u0010\nd3 q 1\n\u2212\u03b2(Ej \u2212\u03bcj )\n,\n\u03a9j =\n(Ej \u2212 \u03bcj ) + T ln 1 \u2212 e\n(2\u03c0)3 2\n(34)\nq\nwhere Ej =\nq2 + m\u2217 2j . However, corrections due to \u03c3\nZ\n\nand \u03c0 0 mesons are exactly cancelled out between \u03a91+1 and\n\u03a91+1\u2217 . This framework is referred to as MF+DF in this paper;\nhere, the static fluctuations of \u03c63 and \u03c68 are taken into account\nin the Hessian matrix.\nAs seen in Fig. 6, at lower T such as T = 0.9Tc and Tc , the\nMF+DF calculation (dashed line) almost reproduces LQCD\ndata. Above Tc such as T = 1.25Tc , the MF+DF calculation underestimates LQCD data. For T > Tc , in general, the\npion mass becomes larger than m0\u03c0 [37]. If m\u03c0 = 2.8m0\u03c0\nis taken, the calculation (dot-dashed line) is consistent with\nLQCD data; this calculation is denoted by MF+DF2 in Fig. 6.\nIV.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nWe have calculated the average phase factor of the QCD\ndeterminant at finite quark chemical potential \u03bcq , using the\ntwo-flavor version of the PNJL model with the scalar-type\neight quark interaction, since the model is successful in reproducing LQCD data not only on the 1+1 system in the limit\nof no \u03bcq [35] but also on the 1+1\u2217 system with finite isospin\nchemical potential \u03bcI [38]. In the present model, there exists a\ncritical endpoint (CEP) in the 1+1 system with finite \u03bcq . The\nCEP lies inside the he2i\u03b8 i = 0 region. This implies that the\nlocation cannot be determined by LQCD solely.\n\n[1] J. B. Kogut and D. K. Sinclair Phys. Rev. D 77, 114503 (2008).\n[2] Z. Fodor, and S. D. Katz, Phys. Lett.

At \u03a6 >\n0.5,\nthe\nfactor\nhe\ni is\n\u223c\nfinite and an increasing function of \u03a6. Thus, there exists a\npositive correlation between he2i\u03b8 i and \u03a6. Therefore, LQCD\nis feasible only in the deconfinement phase with large \u03a6, when\n\u03bcq > m\u03c0 /2.\nThe eight-quark interaction makes the he2i\u03b8 i = 0 region\nshrink, while it shifts the CEP toward higher T and smaller\n\u03bcq . As a consequence of these properties, a relative distance\nof the CEP to the boundary of the he2i\u03b8 i = 0 region becomes\nsmaller. If more accurate LQCD data becomes available in\nfuture outside the he2i\u03b8 i = 0 region, we can predict a location\nof the CEP with the PNJL model the parameters of which are\nfitted to the data. The accuracy of the model prediction seems\nto be proportional to the distance. In this sense, the fact that\nthe relative distance is small is important.\nFor \u03bcq < m\u03c0 /2 where no pion condensate takes place,\nthe PNJL calculation with static fluctuations cannot reproduce\nLQCD data [6] at both T \u2264 Tc and T > Tc . This problem is\nsolved partly by treating dynamical mesonic fluctuations with\nthe pole approximation. The PNJL model with the dynamical\nmesonic fluctuations reproduces LQCD data at T \u2264 Tc . For\nT > Tc , however, the calculation cannot reproduce the data.\nThe first possible reason is that the meson mass at T > Tc is\ndifferent from the value at vacuum. The second possible reason is that the pole approximation is not good, because meson\nat T > Tc is generally in a resonance state. The third possible\nreason is effects of physical states with nonzero baryon numbers. It is reported in Ref. [6] that the physical states tend to\nenhance the average phase factor, although the PNJL model\ndoes not include such effects. This problem should be solved\nin future in order to construct a reliable effective model that\nmakes it possible to predict a location of CEP and the phase\ndiagram at finite \u03bcq .\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors thank K.
