In particular, the charmed-strange mesons Ds0\ns1\nwhich in the limit of an infinitely heavy quark form a pair of mass-degenerate states with\nj P = 12 (where j the total angular momentum of the light quark and P is parity) turn out\nto be narrow states with masses below the DK and D \u22c6 K thresholds. Due to their unanticipated properties, it has been conjectured that these states are not of a simple qq nature.\nLattice QCD is ideally suited to calculate the properties of hadrons from first principles.\nIn recent years conceptional and algorithmic improvements have enabled calculations\nwith light dynamical quarks in boxes of size \u22482.5fm and with fine lattice spacings. We\npresent results from a recent calculation of charmonium and charmed mesons using dynamical gauge configurations with light sea quarks corresponding to pion masses as low\nas 156MeV, which is a significant improvement over previous simulations which employed\neither the quenched approximation or very heavy sea quarks. The following section summarizes the technical aspects of our simulation and the last section presents selected results.\nFor more details please refer to the full published results [2].\n1 mohler@triumf.ca\n\n1\n\n\fXIV International Conference on Hadron Spectroscopy (hadron2011), 13-17 June 2011, Munich, Germany\n\n2\n\nTechnicalities\n\nFor this study 2+1 Clover-Wilson configurations generated by the PACS-CS collaboration [3] have been used. While the mass of the strange quark is kept close to its physical\nmass, pions made from light up and down quarks range from 702 MeV to 156 MeV. The\nnumber of lattice points is 323 \u00d7 64 and the lattice spacing has been determined [3] to be\n0.907(13)fm.

The quantity csw denotes the heavy quark clover coefficient.\n\nFor the charm quarks we use the Fermilab method [4\u20136]. In this approach the spin-averaged\nkinetic mass of the charmed-strange mesons is tuned to assume its physical value. Once\nthe tuning has been done, differences in the rest masses are to be compared to experiment.\nThe resulting charm quark hopping parameter \u03bac is listed in Table 1.\nThe spectrum results are obtained using the variational method [7, 8].

The results we obtain for the lightest sea quarks are plotted in\nthe left panel of Figure 1. Some additional results are also shown in Table 2. In general\nour charmonium results agree qualitatively with the experimental spectrum. The Spindependent splittings displayed in Table 2 are expected to be sensitive to discretization\neffects and we expect that these are the dominant reason for underestimating the splittings\ncompared to experiment.\nMass difference\n\nOur results [MeV]\n\nExperiment [MeV]\n\n1S hyperfine\n1P spin-orbit\n1P tensor\n2S hyperfine\n\n97.8 \u00b1 0.5 \u00b1 1.4\n37.5 \u00b1 2.4 \u00b1 0.5\n10.44 \u00b1 1.13 \u00b1 0.15\n48 \u00b1 18 \u00b1 1\n\n116.6 \u00b1 1.2\n46.6 \u00b1 0.1\n16.25 \u00b1 0.07\n49 \u00b1 4\n\nTable 2: Spin dependent mass splitting in the Charmonium spectrum.\n\nThe right panel of Figure 1 shows the D and Ds spectrum as extracted from our simulation\non the ensemble with the lightest sea quark mass.

At our lowest pion\nmass the artificially heavy scattering states are very close to the measured ground state\nenergy.\n\nin the heavy quark limit. While light sea quarks are important for several of the states, the\ndoublets corresponding to j P = 12 in the heavy quark limit show a substantial difference\ncompared to experiment, which is hard to explain by discretization effects alone. For these\nstates the nearby DK and D \u22c6 K thresholds may play an important role. Figure 2 compares\nthe measured energy levels in the lattice simulation with the experimental resonance and\nthe relevant scattering threshold from experiment. It can be seen that the scattering threshold in our simulation is slightly unphysical. While the state we observe seems to coincide\nwith the scattering threshold at the smallest pion mass, this is no longer the case for larger\npion masses and the overlaps of the state with our interpolator basis (as encoded in the\neigenvectors of the GEVP) suggests that we see the same state at all pion masses. In light\nof this, further studies should include the relevant multi-meson states in the variational\nbasis, which is challenging from a computational point of view.\n\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank the PACS-CS collaboration for access to their gauge configurations.
