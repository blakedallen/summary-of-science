Recently, the two inner planets around\nthe 55 Cancri were found to be in a possible 3:1 MMR (Ji et\nal. 2003). In numerical simulations, the resonant angles are\nfound to librate around certain values. At the same time,\nthe difference between the two periastrons is found to be\nlocked to a fixed value, that is, the two planets precess at\nthe same rate.\nIt is commonly accepted that these extra-solar planets\nare not formed in situ but have suffered orbital migrations.\nDifferent migration speeds of planets may lead to a variation of mutual distance between two neighboring planets\nand eventually a capture into the current resonant configurations (Kley 2000; Kley 2003; Nelson & Papaloizou 2002).\nThe dynamics of these resonances may contain important information of the capturing process and therefore give valuable hints to the planet formation and the evolution of a\nplanetary disk. As a result, planetary systems with reso\u22c6 zhouly@nju.edu.cn\nc 0000 RAS\n\nnance require special attention. Moreover, the possibility of\nan Earth-type (habitable) planet in the 55 Cancri system\nhas been discussed (Cuntz et al. 2003). The existence of a\nhabitable planet in a system depends not only on the current dynamical features of the system but also on the history it has experienced. Therefore it is important to study\nthe now-known planets before an Earth-like planet was observed someday. All these points make this planetary system\ninteresting.\nIn this paper, we confirm the possibility that the two\nplanets are in a 3:1 MMR by numerical integrations and\ndiscuss the possible configurations this system would take\n(section 2), then with a new expansion of the Hamiltonian\nfor a planar three-body problem (section 3), we analyse the\ndynamics of this system. We will discuss the occurrence of\nthe apsidal corotation and its influence on the stability of\nthis system (section 4). Finally the conclusions and discussions are given in section 5.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nNUMERICAL SIMULATIONS\nNumerical model and initial set-up\n\nThe 55 Cancri system is a system with three planets. We\nadopt the orbital solution given by Fischer et al. (2003), as\nbeing listed in Table 1. To numerically simulate this system, we use a symplectic integrator (Wisdom & Holman\n1991; Mikkola & Palmer 2000), which allows us to follow\nthe orbital evolution of each body and simultaneously the\n\n\f2\n\nZhou et al.\n\nTable 1.

Each planet orbit has an\nLCI and we choose the largest one among the three to indicate the stability of this planetary system in this paper.\nThe time step is set to be 0.3 d, which is about 2% of the\norbital period of the innermost planet.\nWe adopt the masses, semimajor axes and eccentricities\nof planets the values listed in Table 1. The initial orbital\ninclination of companion D is set to be zero, while the companion B and C have initial inclinations of 10\u22125 degrees.\nOther angles (the ascending node, the periastron and the\nmean anomaly) are randomly generated from [0, 2\u03c0). Four\nhundred simulations, with different initial conditions, are integrated up to 106 years.\nIgnoring the companion D, we first integrate a system\ncomposed of the central star and the companion B and C.\nThen, retaining the initial conditions of these three bodies\nand adding the companion D on an initial orbit with the\ngiven a, e, i and randomly selected angle elements, we integrate the four-body system. As the simulations show, the\ncompanion D has nearly no influence on the motion of the\ninner planets, although it is much heavier. This is due to\nits large semimajor axis (5.461 au). However, in order to get\nreliable simulations for the real system, we report here the\nnumerical results from the four-body model.\nDuring the integrations, if the distance between any two\nof the planets became smaller than half of the criterion for\nthe \"Hill stability\" (Gladman 1993), the system was considered become collapsed and the simulation was terminated.\nGenerally, the motion of a planet is dominated by the\ncentral star and its orbit is a conic section with small deviations due to the gravitational perturbation from other\nplanet(s). This perturbation can be described by the disturbing function, which can be expanded in terms of the orbital\nelements. We use a, e, i, \u031f, \u03a9, \u03bb to denote the semi-major\naxis, eccentricity, inclination, longitude of periastron, longitude of ascending node, and mean longitude, respectively.\nThe disturbing function for a planet with mass m1 and orbital elements (a1 , e1 , i1 , \u031f1 , \u03a91 , \u03bb1 ), perturbed by another\nplanet (indicated by subscripts '2'), can be written as\nR = \u03bc2\n\nX\n\nF (a1 , a2 , e1 , e2 , i1 , i2 ) cos \u03c6.\n\nHere \u03bc2 = Gm2 and \u03c6 is a linear combination of angles\n\u03c6 = j1 \u03bb1 + j2 \u03bb2 + j3 \u031f1 + j4 \u031f2 + j5 \u03a91 + j6 \u03a92\nwhere j1 , j2 , * * * , j6 are integers satisfying j1 +j2 +* * *+j6 = 0.\nParticularly, when the orbital periods satisfy P2 /P1 \u2248\n3, that is, \u03bb\u03071 \u2212 3\u03bb\u03072 \u2248 0 (dots denote the time derivation),\nwe have \u03c6\u0307(j1 =1,j2 =\u22123) \u2248 0 since generally \u031f\n \u0307 1, \u031f\n \u0307 2 , \u03a9\u03071 , \u03a9\u03072 \u226a\n\u03bb\u03071 , \u03bb\u03072 . Then in the disturbing function R, those terms con-\n\nFigure 2. A typical temporal evolution of the semimajor axes\na1 , a2 in a stable system.\n\ntaining \u03bb1 \u2212 3\u03bb2 can not be eliminated by the averaging\ntechnique and become the leading terms. And if the inclinations i1 , i2 are not too large, the leading terms in R\nare of O(e21 ), O(e22 ), O(e1 e2 ) and the corresponding angle \u03c6,\nnow called resonant arguments, are \u03b81 = \u03bb1 \u2212 3\u03bb2 + 2\u031f1 ,\n\u03b82 = \u03bb1 \u2212 3\u03bb2 + 2\u031f2 , \u03b83 = \u03bb1 \u2212 3\u03bb2 + \u031f1 + \u031f2 . Therefore the\nlibration of any one of \u03b81,2,3 indicates the two planets are in\nan (eccentricity-type) 3:1 MMR. We note that no more than\ntwo of them are linear independent and \u03b83 = (\u03b81 + \u03b82 )/2 [see\nfor example Murray & Dermott (1999) for more details].\nBeside these resonant arguments, the relative apsidal\nlongitude \u2206\u031f = \u031f1 \u2212 \u031f2 is also a critical argument often\nto be discussed. We call the libration of \u2206\u031f in an MMR\nthe apsidal corotation. In a 3:1 MMR, if both \u03b81 and \u03b82\nlibrate with small amplitudes, \u2206\u031f = 12 (\u03b81 \u2212 \u03b82 ) will also\nnecessarily librate. In this sense, the apsidal corotation is not\nindependent and should be different from the term of apsidal\nresonance, which is in the context of a secular perturbation.\nHereafter we use subscripts 1, 2 to label the orbital elements of companion B and C respectively.\n2.2\n\nNumerical results\n\nAbout one third (133 out of 400) of the simulations collapse\nduring the integrations, and all the remainders survive for\nthe 106 yr integration. Most of the survivors have very short\n(< 102 yr) e-folding time Te (= 1/LCI, the reciprocal of\n3\nLCI), while 38 of them have Te >\n= 10 yr, and they are in\nthis sense regarded as stable. In these stable systems, all the\n\u25e6\nthree planets have final inclinations <\n\u223c 0 .1, but those un3\nstable (Te < 10 yr) systems may have inclinations of companion B and C as high as \u223c 20\u25e6 , that is, the stable system\nprefers to retain to be coplanar. All the stable systems are\nfound to be associated with the 3:1 MMR between the two\ninner planets.\nAccording to different configurations of \u03b81,2,3 and \u2206\u031f,\nthe stable systems can be divided into three groups, with\nrepresentative cases illustrated in Fig. 1. In all the cases,\nthe companion D is in a steady motion (we don't illustrate\nthis here) and, the semi-major axes of companion B and C\nvibrate with very small variations (an example is shown in\nFig. 2).\nCase a (Fig. 1) shows a strong resonance with \u03b81 , \u03b82\nand \u03b83 librating around 215\u25e6 , 75\u25e6 and 325\u25e6 , respectively.\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fapsidal corotation in 55 Cnc\n\n3\n\nFigure 1.

Case a, b, and c are from different initial conditions.\n\nSimultaneously, the \u2206\u031f also librates around 250\u25e6 . The well\nknown symmetric configurations of \u2206\u031f librating around 0\u25e6\n(alignment) or 180\u25e6 (anti-alignment) imply the conjunctions\nof the two planets always occur at a certain position and this\nattributes to the stability of the system (Lee & Peale 2002).\nHowever the asymmetric configuration with \u2206\u031f librating\naround angles other than 0\u25e6 or 180\u25e6 , has been predicted by\nBeaug\u00e9, Ferraz-Mello & Michtchenko (2003).\nCase b differs from case a in the behavior of \u03b81 , \u03b83 and\n\u2206\u031f, which circulate now. The \u03b82 still librates around 80\u25e6\nwith an amplitude of 40\u25e6 . In fact, when \u03b82 librates with a\nsmall amplitude, we may assume \u03b82 \u2248 const., that is, \u03b8\u03072 \u2248 0.\nFrom \u03b8\u03072 = \u03bb\u03071 \u2212 3\u03bb\u03072 + 2\u031f\n \u0307 2 \u2248 0 we can derive\n1\nn2 \u2212 \u031f\n \u03072\n\u2248 ,\nn1 \u2212 \u031f\n \u03072\n3\nwhere n1,2 = \u03bb\u03071,2 are the mean motions of planets. In a\nreference frame corotating with the periastron of the second\nplanet, the relative mean motions are n\u2032k = nk \u2212 \u031f\n \u0307 2 (k =\n1, 2), and from n\u20322 /n\u20321 \u2248 1/3 we know that in this reference\nframe the conjunctions of planets always happen at a certain\ndirection. Meanwhile, given nk \u226b \u031f\n \u0307 2 , we have n2 /n1 \u2248\nn\u20322 /n\u20321 and there is still a 3:1 relation between the two orbital\nperiods. In the 55 Cancri system, our numerical results show\nn1,2 are larger than \u031f\n \u0307 2 by at least two order of magnitudes.\nAlthough the numerical simulations give more examples\nwith configuration as case a than case b (28 vs 7, see Table\n2), we notice that among the most stable sets with e-folding\ntime Te \u223c 106 yr (the same order as the integration time),\nthere are two sets having configurations as case b but only\none as case a. This prevents us from concluding which type,\ncase a or case b, is more stable.\nIn case c, \u03b81 , \u03b83 and \u2206\u031f circulate, while \u03b82 librates\naround 180\u25e6 with a quite large amplitude of 160\u25e6 . As a result, it is less stable than the above two cases. The only three\nexamples with this configuration in our simulations all have\ne-folding times < 5 \u00d7 103 yr.\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\nTable 2.

Another noteworthy feature of\nnumerical results is that the system has a symmetry over\nangles \u03b8i and \u2206\u031f, that is, when \u03c6 is a libration center of\n\u03b8i or \u2206\u031f, the argument (360\u25e6 \u2212 \u03c6) is too. For example, we\nobserve \u03b82 librates around \u223c 80\u25e6 and \u223c 280\u25e6 with nearly\nthe same ratio in our simulations.\n\n2.3\n\nSome extended calculations\n\nTo integrate all the surviving systems to 107 yr or even\nlonger is out of our current computational capability. However, to explore further the stabilities of different configurations, we integrate the three examples shown in Fig. 1 further\nto 3 \u00d7 107 years. Both the case a and b last this time span\nand keep the configurations all the time. But case c loses\nthe stability when the inclinations of companion B and C\nincrease to \u223c 5\u25e6 after \u223c 1 \u00d7 107 years. As in those unstable\nexamples, this inclination increasing is due to a sequence of\nclose encounters between the two planets. On the contrary,\nthe mechanism of the 3:1 MMR can protect those systems\nas case a and b from catastrophic close encounters.\nOther 5 examples randomly selected from the 17 systems with Te \u223c 103 yr are integrated to 1\u00d7107 yr. Again, except the one having motion configuration as case c, they all\n\n\f4\n\nZhou et al.\n\nTable 3.

[The LCI\nwill converge to a certain value as the integrating time approaches to infinity, so Te of an orbit would change when it's\nintegrated to a longer time span. see for example (Froeschl\u00e9\n1984).] As for those systems with larger Te , they are more\nstable and should have longer surviving lives.\nSo far, our discussions are all based on the small initial\ninclinations of the two inner planets. We find that in stable\nsystems the inner two planets are locked to the 3:1 MMR and\ntheir small orbital inclinations can be kept to at least 106 yr.\nWhile in those unstable systems, chaotic close encounters of\nplanets could cause inclinations to increase. Furthermore, we\nalso numerically simulated hundreds of examples with larger\ninitial inclinations. In these systems, except the inclinations\nof the two inner planets are set to higher values, all the\norbital elements are initialized in the same way as before,\nand we integrate these systems to 106 yr. A brief summary\nis given in Table 3.\nWe see the survive probability drops from 66% to 21%\nas the initial inclinations increase from 10\u22125 to 25 degrees,\nbut at the same time the percentage of stable systems even\ndoes not decrease until i01,2 = 10\u25e6 before it attains a value\nof \u223c 5%. This implies that the stability of the system is\nnot so sensitive to the inclinations, and if smaller than 10\ndegrees, they have nearly no influence on the stability of the\nsystem. On the other hand, that all the stable examples are\nassociated with the 3:1 MMR reveals again the importance\nof this resonance in stabilizing this planetary system, even\nwhen the orbits are far from coplanar. We don't give more\nanalysis to the problem of higher inclinations here, but it\ndeserves a detailed discussion in future .\n\n3\n\nANALYTICAL MODEL\n\nTo understand the dynamics of the 3:1 MMR in the 55 Cancri, it is useful to describe it with an analytical model. As\nwe mentioned above, the companion D has a very weak influence on the motion of the inner planets. In addition, the\nnumerical simulations show it is mainly the 3:1 MMR that\nis responsible for the stability of the system, in spite of the\nhigher orbital inclinations. So, a planar three-body problem is a reasonable model for describing this planetary system, especially when we mainly focus on the 3:1 MMR. Of\ncourse, considering the possible substantial difference between the coplanar and non-coplanar motion, a more realistic and reliable model is still needed. On the other hand, the\nusual analytical perturbation models, such as the Laplace\nexpansions, are not convergent for high eccentricities, and\nexpansions with low-order truncations may yield imprecise\nresults (Ferraz-Mello 1994). Recently, a new expansion of the\nHamiltonian suitable for high-eccentricities has been developed by Beaug\u00e9 and Michtchenko (2003). We will apply this\nexpansion to the system the 55 Cancri.\n\n3.1\n\nThe Hamiltonian\n\nSuppose three bodies with mass M0 , m1 , m2 orbiting around\ntheir common center of mass. M0 \u226b m1,2 is the central star\nand m1,2 > 0 are the planets. Near the 3 : 1 MMR, a set of\ncanonical variables are defined as:\n1\n\u03bb1 ;\nJ1 = L1 + (I1 + I2 )\n2\n3\n\u03bb2 ;\nJ2 = L2 \u2212 (I1 + I2 )\n2\n1\n3\nI1 = L1 \u2212 G1\n(1)\n\u03c31 = \u03bb 2 \u2212 \u03bb 1 \u2212 \u031f 1 ;\n2\n2\n3\n1\n\u03c32 = \u03bb 2 \u2212 \u03bb 1 \u2212 \u031f 2 ;\nI2 = L2 \u2212 G2\n2\n2\np\n\u221a\nwhere Li = m\u2032i \u03bci ai and Gi = Li 1 \u2212 e2i are Delaunay\nvariables, ai , ei , \u03bbi , \u031fi are the orbital elements of the ith\nplanet, \u03bci = G(mi +M0 ), G is the gravitational constant, and\nM0\nm\u2032i = mmii+M\nis the reduced mass. These canonical variables\n0\ndefine a four degree-of-freedom system. And let's bear in\nmind \u03b8i = \u22122\u03c3i (i = 1, 2), \u03b83 = \u2212\u03c31 \u2212\u03c32 and \u2206\u031f = \u03c32 \u2212\u03c31 .\nAfter considering the conservation of angular momentum and averaging over the fast-angle, we get two integrals\nof motion Jsum = J1 + J2 , Jdif = J1 \u2212 J2 . At the same time,\nthe problem is reduced to a two degree-of-freedom system in\ncanonical variables (Ii , \u03c3i ). The resulting Hamiltonian reads\nH=\u2212\n\n2\nX\n\u03bc2 m\u20323\ni\n\ni=1\n\ni\n\n2L2i\n\n+ H1\n\n(2)\n\nwhere H1 is the truncated disturbing function,\nH1 =\n\n3 jmax kmax umax\nGm1 m2 X X X X\na2\n\nlmax\n\nX\n\nn=0 j=0 k=0 u=0 l=\u2212lmax\n\nRn,j,k,u,l (\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b10 )n\n\n\u00d7ej1 ek2 cos(2u\u03c31 + l(\u03c32 \u2212 \u03c31 )).\n\n(3)\n\nHere \u03b1 = a1 /a2 is the ratio between the two semimajor\naxes and \u03b10 is its value in the exact MMR. The coefficients Rn,j,k,u,l can be determined beforehand (Beaug\u00e9 &\nMichtchenko 2003). Considering the high value of eccentricities, we adopt the upper limits of sums umax = lmax = 12\nand jmax = kmax = 15 in this paper. For convenience, the\nHamiltonian has been expressed explicitly in (ai , ei ) instead\nof (Ii , Ji ), therefore the integrals Jsum and Jdif don't appear\nexplicitly but exist as constrains. We note the total energy\nH is an integral too. Furthermore, it is easy to prove the\nsymmetry buried in the Hamiltonian:\nH(\u03c31 , \u03c32 ) \u2261 H(\u2212\u03c31 , \u2212\u03c32 ) \u2261 H(180\u25e6 + \u03c31 , 180\u25e6 + \u03c32 ).\n3.2\n\nThe reliability of the Hamiltonian\n\nWe can calculate planet orbits by applying this Hamiltonian.\nSince it is an averaged system, the time step can now be\nmuch longer than that used in our symplectic integrator.\nA comparison between this Hamiltonian expansion and the\ndirect numerical integration is shown in Fig. 3, in which we\nchoose the most unstable case of Fig. 1c as an example. We\nget the same initial conditions and recalculate the orbits\nfrom the Hamiltonian equations with an average (variable)\ntime step of 60 d, which is four times of the inner planet's\norbital period.\nThe agreements in Fig. 3, not only imply the reliability\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fapsidal corotation in 55 Cnc\n\n5\n\nFigure 4.

Although it is still non-integrable, it can help us to\nunderstand the dynamical properties of the system. In this\nsection, we will use it to find out why and when the system\nfollows the different types of resonant evolutions as shown in\nFig. 1, and then via the surface of section technique we study\nthe stability of the systems with different configurations.\n\n4.1\n\nThe eccentricities and the resonant angles\n\nSince Jsum and Jdif are integrals, J1 = 12 (Jsum + Jdif )\nand J2 = 21 (Jsum \u2212 Jdif ) are invariables too. They constrain the variation of the planetary semi-major axes by\n\u221a\n\u221a\n3J1 + J2 = 3m\u20321 \u03bc1 a1 + m\u20322 \u03bc2 a2 = const. However, when\nwe discuss planets trapped in an MMR, we may simply assume the semi-major axes are constants, otherwise the resonance would be destroyed. In fact, the numerical simulations\nin section 2 also support this assumption (Fig. 2). Similarly,\nsimple calculations show that\nJsum = m\u20321\n\np\n\n\u03bc1 a1 (1 \u2212 e21 ) + m\u20322\n\np\n\n\u03bc2 a2 (1 \u2212 e22 ).\n\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n(4)\n\nThis confines the variation of the eccentricities when we\nfix the semi-major axes a1 and a2 . Besides this, the variation range of the eccentricities is also bounded by other\nconstrains, e.g., the total energy of the system.\nWe assume the two semi-major axes are fixed, a1 =\n0.115 au and a2 = 0.241 au. Then Eq. (4) defines a family\nof curves on the (e1 , e2 )-plane (Fig. 4). Each curve in Fig. 4\ncorresponds to a definite value of the integral Jsum . The\norbital elements in Table 1 give Jsum = 3.591733 \u00d7 10\u22124 , so\nthat the eccentricities e1 , e2 of orbits beginning from these\ninitial conditions are restricted on the corresponding curve\nduring the dynamical evolution.\nAfter assuming a1,2 fixed, for certain e1,2 values, we\ncan calculate the energy level curves of the Hamiltonian on\nthe (\u03c31 , \u03c32 )-plane. Fig. 5 shows such contours. At the first\nglance, we note the symmetry over both \u03c31 and \u03c32 . This\nhas been observed in our numerical simulations (recalling\n\u03b8i = \u22122\u03c3i ).\nSince the total energy H is an integral, a system starting from a point on any curve in Fig. 5 can never jump to\nother curve with a different energy. On the other hand, the\nvariation of eccentricities (Fig. 4) is constrained by the integral Jsum through Eq. (4). Therefore, as the eccentricities\nvary following Eq. (4), an energy curve on the (\u03c31 , \u03c32 )-plane\nwill extend to an energy surface (e.g. a cylinder) and the\nsystem will evolve on this surface. To illustrate this, we fix\na1 = 0.115 au and a2 = 0.241 au, set e1 = 0.03 (and sequently 0.10, 0.15, 0.20), evaluate the corresponding e2 from\nEq. (4) with Jsum = 3.591733\u00d710\u22124 , then calculate contours\nfor different pairs of (e1 , e2 ). Finally, we get a series of section of the energy surface in Fig. 5. In this way, we can follow\nthe dynamical evolution of a system starting from definite\ninitial conditions.\nFor example, the thick curves in Fig. 5, representing an\nenergy H = \u22123.957679 \u00d7 10\u22123 , keep the closed oblate shape\nwhen e1 evolves from the initial value 0.03 to 0.20. The\noblate profile of the curve implies that the angle \u03c31 (\u03b81 ) has\na larger reachable range than \u03c32 (\u03b82 )during the temporal\nevolution of a system with initial conditions located on this\ncurve. The angle \u03c31 could vary in a range of \u223c (160\u25e6 , 400\u25e6 ),\nwhile \u03c32 is bounded between 20\u25e6 and 60\u25e6 . Correspondingly,\n\n\f6\n\nZhou et al.\n\nFigure 6.

The energy level curves of the Hamiltonian on the\n(\u03c31 , \u03c32 )-plane. A gray level code is used to measure energy values, the darker regions indicate smaller energy value, and vice\nversa. a, b, c, and d are the case for e1 = 0.03, 0.10, 0.15 and 0.20\nrespectively, with e2 obtained from Eq. (4).\n\nthe resonant angle \u03b81 and \u03b82 could vary in ranges with widths\nof 480\u25e6 (circulation) and 80\u25e6 (libration), respectively. This\nis just the situation of case b in Fig. 1. Another example\nindicated by a dashed curve with H = \u22123.957722 \u00d7 10\u22123\nexhibits the possibility of circulating of both \u03b81 and \u03b82 .\nWe denote the possible variation of \u03c3i in Fig. 5 by \u2206\u03c3i .\nAccording to the foregoing analysis, \u2206\u03c32 < \u2206\u03c31 . If \u2206\u03c31 <\n\u223c\n\u25e6\n180\u25e6 , both \u03b81 and \u03b82 would librate (\u2206\u03b82 < \u2206\u03b81 <\n\u223c 360 )\nand the system could run as Fig. 1a. It could run as Fig. 1b,\n\u25e6\nif \u2206\u03c31 >\n\u223c 180 while \u03c32 is still bounded in a narrow range,\n\u25e6\n\u25e6\nsay \u2206\u03c32 <\n90\n. And if 90\u25e6 <\n\u223c\n\u223c \u2206\u03c32 <\n\u223c 180 , Fig. 1c could be\nfollowed. So the measures of such areas in the whole (\u03c31 , \u03c32 )plane tell the probabilities of different types of motion. Calculations show the proportions of these regions in the whole\nplane, i.e. the probabilities of motion type a, b and c, approximatively are 10%, 16% and 4.5%, respectively. They\nare coarse estimates because we don't count the stability of\nthe a possible motion. After considering the stability, these\nestimates must decrease in different extents.\nIn a word, given ai , ei , the dynamical evolution of a\nsystem is determined by the initial values of \u03c3i (i = 1, 2),\nwhich consequently correspond to different energy H.\n\n\"free\" variables e2 and \u2206\u031f. We calculate the contour of such\nHamiltonian on the (e2 , \u2206\u031f)-plane and show it in Fig. 6.\nThe contour of the velocity of \u2206\u031f is also calculated and\nshown in Fig. 7.\nA system approximately satisfying the assumptions\nmentioned above will evolve along one of the curves in Fig. 6.\nFor the inner two planets in the 55 Cancri, the initial orbital\nelements listed in Table 1 (e01 = 0.03, e02 = 0.41) correspond\nto the right boundary of the box in Fig. 6. Two different fates\nof a system starting from these initial conditions are distinguished: one is characterized by a libration of \u2206\u031f around\n\u223c 250\u25e6 and the other a circulation of \u2206\u031f. In the latter case,\nthe eccentricity e2 can reach a smaller value (correspondingly e1 a higher value). These agree pretty well with the\ndirectly numerical integrations. Such agreements are shown\nin Fig. 6 by a comparing plots of the numerical results.\nFig. 7 shows the velocity of \u2206\u031f. Through this figure,\nwe can explain how \u2206\u031f evolves. Along the right boundary of the box, the absolute value of velocity could be\nvery large, so that \u2206\u031f increases or decreases quickly. Let\nus write\nthe perturbing part of the Hamiltonian as H1 =\nP\njmax Pkmax\nRj,k ej1 ek2 , where Rj,k contains the coefficients\nj=0\nk=0\nRn,j,k,u,l and sums over n, u, l in Eq.(3).

Since \u03c32\ngenerally has a smaller libration amplitude than \u03c31 , we can\nfurther simplify the Hamiltonian by safely setting \u03c32 \u2261 \u03c320 .\nTo determine \u03c320 , we can calculate the stable stationary solutions of the Hamiltonian equations (Beaug\u00e9 et al 2003),\nor we can get an estimate from the position of the Hamiltonian extremum in Fig. 5. But in this paper, we simply\nadopt \u03c320 = 320\u25e6 (\u03b82 = 80\u25e6 ) from the numerical results. Recalling the constant semimajor axes and the constrain on\neccentricities, the Hamiltonian can be explicitly expressed\nas H = H(a02 , a01 , e2 , e1 (Jsum , e2 ), \u03c320 , \u2206\u031f), with only two\n\njmax kmax\ne22\n\nXX\n1\u2212\nkRj,k ej1 ek2 .\ne22 L2\n\n(5)\n\nj=0 k=1\n\nObviously, when ei \u226a 1, the dominating term on the right\nhand side has the order \u223c e1i . Near the right boundary of the\nbox in Fig. 7, we have e1 \u223c 0.03 \u226a 1. That's the reason why\n\u2206\u031f has a quick change when e1 approaches its minimum\nvalue as shown in Fig. 1b,c.\nThe numerical simulations reveal that the quick varying\nof \u2206\u031f in Fig. 1b,c is caused by a quick varying of \u031f1 when\ne1 \u2192 0. In fact, when an orbit is nearly circular (e \u223c 0),\nit would be relatively easy to change its direction (\u031f), thus\nthe two planets could loose the locking of periastrons if they\nwere not in a strong coupling. On the other hand, whether\nthey can strongly couple with each other depends also on\nhow close they can approach each other, that is, how large\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fapsidal corotation in 55 Cnc\n\nFigure 7.

Dots and squares are the same as in Fig. 6.\n\ntheir eccentricities (especially e2 ) are. Bearing this in mind\nwe can understand why in case a e2 has a higher lower-limit\nthan in cases b and c. Of course, a small e2 can also cause\na quick variation of \u2206\u031f, but this situation does not happen\nbecause the energy integral prevents e2 from approaching\nvery small value.\nFrom Fig. 6 and Fig. 7, we see different behaviors of\n\u2206\u031f (circulation or libration) have different varying directions along the right edge of the box. By numerically solving the equation d\u2206\u031f/dt = 0, we find two zero velocity\npoints on the boundary. They define the boundaries of the\ninitial conditions leading to a librating or circulating of \u2206\u031f.\nThe calculations show that the apsidal corotation happens\nif \u2206\u031f 0 \u2208 (160\u25e6 , 330\u25e6 ), while if \u2206\u031f 0 \u2208 (\u221230\u25e6 , 160\u25e6 ), \u2206\u031f\ncirculates.\nThe case c has a Hamiltonian value a little further from\nthe extremum in Fig. 5, so that \u03c32 (\u03b82 ) has a large amplitude\nof libration and can not be assumed as a constant. As a\nresult, we can not find a corresponding curve for it in Fig. 6.\nHowever, if we draw a series of Hamiltonian contour with\ndifferent value of \u03c32 (adding another dimension to Fig. 6),\nwe can also understand its dynamical evolution.\nFig. 8 summarizes the initial conditions of the 38 stable\nexamples in the numerical simulations. For clarity, we have\nmapped the symmetric configurations to one regime according to the symmetry of the Hamiltonian. Except the three\nexamples as case c, all the points for stable systems gather\nalong the line of \u03c320 = 320\u25e6 , and points for librating and\ncirculating \u2206\u031f (case a and b) are separated by the dotted\nlines of \u2206\u031f 0 = 160\u25e6 , 330\u25e6 . These agree very well with the\nabove analysis with the Hamiltonian.\nWe have given an estimate of the probability of following different ways as case a, b and c. The analyses here tell\nthat all the initial conditions leading to stable configurations\ngather in a narrow strip along the line in Fig. 8. That is, for\nsystems having given a1,2 , e1,2 as in Table 1, only those with\ninitial conditions satisfying \u03c320 \u2248 320\u25e6 and \u03c310 + \u2206\u031f 0 \u2248 320\u25e6\ncan survive for long time.\n\n4.3\n\nSurfaces of section\n\nWe know now the initial conditions determine whether the\napsidal corotation happens or not, but whether a system\nwould follow a definite evolution type also depends on the\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n7\n\nFigure 8. The initial conditions of the 38 stable systems. Open\nsquares, plus and solid squares indicate the systems evolving as\ncase a, b and c in Fig. 1. The dotted lines give the positions of\n\u2206\u031f 0 = 160\u25e6 , 330\u25e6 and the solid line is \u03c320 = \u2206\u031f 0 + \u03c310 = 320\u25e6 .\n\nstability of an evolution type. The stability of an orbit\nin the phase space can be revealed by its projection on\nthe surface of section. We present in Fig. 9 the sections of\n(I2 cos \u03c32 , I2 sin \u03c32 ) for the three orbits in Fig. 1. The plane\nis defined as \u03c31 = 270\u25e6 , \u03c3\u03071 > 0. To obtain these, we adopt\nthe initial conditions of orbits from Fig. 1, and then integrate\nthe corresponding Hamiltonian equations based on the expansion as Eq. (2,3).\nFig. 9c indicates case c has a chaotic orbit. On the contrary, the invariant curves for cases a and b (Fig. 9a,b) imply\nthat both these two orbits are regular. That is, no matter\nwhether the apsidal corotation happens or not, the system\ntrapped in the 3:1 MMR could be stable. From this point of\nview we may argue the apsidal corotation only has a limited\ncontribution to the stability of the system.\nBecause the Hamiltonian is expressed explicitly in ai , ei\nand the integrals of motion Jsum , Jdif affect the system as\nconstrains, we can only define an energy surface (H \u2261 H0 )\nwith certain pre-determined Jsum , Jdif , then calculate the\nsurface of section. We find the structure of the phase space\nand the stability of the system depends sensitively not only\non H but also on Jsum and Jdif . For example, with the same\nvalues of H, Jsum and Jdif as the ones in Fig. 1b, we calculate\ntens of orbits with different initial conditions. On the surface\nof section, these orbits occupy a big regular-motion region.\nThis result does not conflict with the fact that there are only\na small fraction of stable systems in numerical simulations,\nin fact, when we change H, (or Jsum , Jdif ) just a little, we\nfind remarkable chaotic region on the surface of section. The\napplication of the surface-of-section technique is limited by\nthe high dimension of the system. This will be discussed in\ndetail in our future paper.\n\n5\n\nSUMMARY AND DISCUSSION\n\nWith hundreds of numerical simulations of the planetary\nsystem of the 55 Cancri, we find the third planet has a\nvery weak influence on the motion of the inner two planets. We confirm the inner two could be trapped in a 3:1\nmean motion resonance and three different types of motion\nare found. Judging from the Lyapunov character indicators\nand the surviving time of integration, two of them (case a,\n\n\f8\n\nZhou et al.\n\nFigure 9. The projection on the surfaces of sections for case a, b and c in Fig. 1.\n\nb) are practically stable, so that the real system could be\nrunning in one of these configurations.\nVia a new Hamiltonian expansion which is suitable for\nhigh-eccentricities planar three-body problem, we study the\ndynamics of the different configurations. We discuss the variations of eccentricities and resonant angles, explain the happenings of different evolving types, and give a criterion of\nthe occurrence of the apsidal corotation.\nThe surfaces of section for the three types of motion are\ncalculated and they reveal the stabilities of systems with or\nwithout the apsidal corotation. With these results we argue\nthat the stability of the system is mainly due to the 3:1\nMMR, and the apsidal corotation has only a limited contribution. We would like to mention that this method can also\nbe applied to other extra-solar planetary systems with other\nmean motion resonances.\nNumerical simulations suggest at least \u223c 10 percent of\nsystems are in a 3:1 MMR, while the Hamiltonian analyses give an upper limit of \u223c 30%, which however will drop\ndown after considering the stability. We also list the initial\nconditions leading to this MMR.\nSystems with different motion configurations have different energy (H) levels. The apsidal corotation happens\nwhen the Hamiltonian approaches the extreme value. So,\nif the two planets are captured into current configuration\nthrough orbital migration caused by the action of nonconservative forces, the system should have an extremum of\nenergy so that the apsidal corotation happens (Kley 2003).\nWhen the future observations would reveal more accurate\nproperties of this system, we may consider what signatures\nof the migration are still presented in this system.\nThe masses of planets adopted in this paper are the\nvalues from the orbital solutions when assuming sin i = 1.\nAs for the situations of sin i < 1, our initial analysis with\nthe Hamiltonian get the very similar results in a wide range\nof sin i. This is also consistent with the results in (Beaug\u00e9\net al 2003). We have also analysed the possible motion configurations and their stabilities if the initial eccentricities\ndiffer from the values adopted above. With the help of the\nHamiltonian model, we find that a higher e2 favors the establishment of a 3:1 MMR. Anyway, we'd like to leave more\ndetails of these to our future paper.\nLast but not least, the general relativity effect may af-\n\nfects the secular dynamics of the 55 Cancri system, since the\nCompanion B and C are quite close to the central star. For\nthe innermost planet, the orbital precession caused by the\ngeneral relativity effect, is calculated. Although this periastron shift, \u223c 1.66 \u00d7 10\u22126 radians per orbit, is quite small,\nit's about three times larger than that of Mercury in our\nSolar system.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nWe thank Dr. Beaug\u00e9 for helpful discussions.
