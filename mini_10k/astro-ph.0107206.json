Pulsars in this cluster with\na negative period derivative, which must lie in the distant half of the cluster, have significantly higher measured\nintegrated electron column densities than the pulsars with a positive period derivative. We derive the plasma\ndensity within the central few pc of the cluster using two different methods which yield consistent values. Our\nbest estimate of ne = 0.067 \u00b1 0.015 cm\u22123 is about 100 times the free electron density of the ISM in the vicinity of\n47 Tucanae, and the ionized gas is probably the dominant component of the intracluster medium.\nSubject headings: globular clusters: individual (47 Tucanae) - pulsars: general\nbefore, but uses a 2 \u00d7 512 \u00d7 0.5-MHz filter bank centered on\n1390 MHz, and a sampling interval of 80 \u03bcs. With these data\nwe acquire very high quality pulse profiles, from which we obtain the precise dispersion measure for each pulsar (DM, the\nintegrated electron column density along the line of sight from\nthe Earth), from the relative delays in the arrival times of pulses\nin four contiguous 64-MHz subbands.\nWe do this with the TEMPO timing software1 as follows. First\nwe determine timing solutions for all pulsars including spin, astrometric, and binary parameters where relevant, as detailed in\nFreire et al. (2001), but using only data collected at 1.4 GHz\n(medium-resolution data during 1997 August\u20131999 August and\nhigh-resolution data during 1999 August\u20132001 February). In\nvirtually all cases the parameters obtained are consistent at the\n3 \u03c3 level with those reported by Freire et al. (2001). We then\nhold the pulsar ephemerides fixed at these values, and fit for\nDM, using only high-resolution times-of-arrival measured in\nfour frequency subbands. The resulting DMs are listed in Table 1, along with the (\u1e56/P)obs , and angular offset from the center of the cluster for each pulsar, \u03b8\u22a5 , as determined by Freire et\nal. (2001).\nAs Figure 1 shows, all 15 pulsars are located near the center of the cluster. Having periods of a few milliseconds, they\nare expected to have the small positive intrinsic period derivatives \u1e56int which are typical of millisecond pulsars. However, the\ngravitational field of the cluster causes the pulsars to accelerate\ntoward its center. The line-of-sight component a of this acceleration results in a contribution to the observed period derivative\nof each pulsar given by \u1e56/P = a/c, where c is the speed of\nlight. In the central regions of 47 Tuc, these values are typically greater than the (\u1e56/P)int for millisecond pulsars (Freire et\nal. 2001), so that the pulsars act as tracers of the cluster gravitational field.\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\n8\n\nEvery \u223c 10 yr, globular clusters pass through the plane of\nthe Galaxy, during which any intracluster gas is expected to\nbe stripped from the systems (Spergel 1991). However, winds\nfrom evolved stars continuously fill the cluster with gas between passages. Heretofore, numerous searches for the expected neutral and ionized material have been unsuccessful (see\nreferences in Spergel 1991; Hesser & Shawl 1977; Smith et al.\n1990; Knapp et al. 1996; Penny, Evans, & Odenkirchen 1997;\nHopwood et al. 1999) or inconclusive (Krockenberger & Grindlay 1995; Origlia et al. 1997b). The most convincing evidence\npresented so far was a 3 \u03c3 detection of two CO lines in the direction of 47 Tucanae (henceforth 47 Tuc). These were interpreted\nas resulting from a bow shock formed as the cluster moves in\nthe Galactic halo (Origlia et al. 1997a), indicating the presence\nof an intracluster medium. There is also an unconfirmed 3.5 \u03c3\nSCUBA detection of dust in NGC 6356 at \u03bb = 850 nm (Hopwood et al. 1998), and a tentative detection of diffuse X-ray\nemission by the intracluster medium of NGC 6779 (Hopwood\net al. 2000).\nIn this Letter we report the detection of ionized gas in 47 Tuc\nfrom new measurements of the radio dispersion of 15 of the 20\nmillisecond pulsars known in the cluster (Camilo et al. 2000).\n2. OBSERVATIONS\n\nObservations of 47 Tuc using the Parkes radio telescope at\na frequency of 1.4 GHz have been used to measure the precise positions, periods P, and apparent rates of change of period \u1e56obs , for 15 of its 20 known pulsars (Freire et al. 2001).\nWe have continued timing observations of the pulsars in this\ncluster, and since 1999 August have used a new system providing a three-fold increase in time resolution. This consists of\nthe central beam of the Parkes telescope multibeam receiver, as\n1 http://pulsar.princeton.edu/tempo\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nIonized Gas in 47 Tuc\n24.8\nD\n\nU\n\n24.7\n\nH\n\nJ\n\nN\n\nL\nO\n\nM\n\n\u22123\n\nC\n\nE\n\nJ\n\nN\n\nT G,I\n\nDM (cm pc)\n\nQ\nD\n\nC\n\n24.6\n\nF\n\n24.5\nM\nI\n\n24.4\n\nL\n\nG\n\nT\nH\n\n24.3\n\nO\nQ\n\nF\nU\nE\n\n24.2\n\n24.1\n\nF IG . 1.- The positions of 15 millisecond pulsars in 47 Tuc superimposed\non an optical image of the cluster (obtained by D. Malin, Anglo-Australian\nObservatory). All pulsars are located within 1.\u2032 2 (\u2248 2 pc, delineated by the\ncircle) of the center of the cluster (Freire et al. 2001). North is to the top and\neast is to the left.\n\nConversely, from a knowledge of the gravitational field of\nthe globular cluster, one can use an observed period derivative\nto constrain the position of a pulsar in the cluster along the line\nof sight. In particular, pulsars located on the far side of the cluster will experience an acceleration directed towards the Earth,\nresulting in a negative period derivative which often exceeds\nthe intrinsic value, leading to a negative value of (\u1e56/P)obs . We\nobserve this for nine of the 15 pulsars (Table 1). Figure 2 shows\nthe measured DMs plotted against (\u1e56/P)obs . Strikingly, most of\nthe nine pulsars with negative (\u1e56/P)obs , which must lie in the\ndistant half of the cluster, have significantly higher DMs than\nthose with positive (\u1e56/P)obs, most of which are likely to reside\non the near side.\nWe now show that this configuration is unlikely to arise by\nchance, by computing the chance probability of observing (as\nwe do) the 7 pulsars with the highest DMs all having a negative\n\u1e56 (we neglect in this calculation 47 Tuc L and T, whose DMs\nand uncertainties make their contribution to this argument uncertain). The number of sets of 7 pulsars among the 13 with a\ntiming solution is 13!/(7! \u00d7 6!) = 1716. The number of sets of 7\npulsars among the 8 with a negative \u1e56 is 8. Therefore the probability that the observed arrangement is due to chance is small,\n8/1716 \u2248 0.005. It is conceivable that the observed variations\nin DM are simply a result of electron density variations along\nthe different lines of sight in the interstellar medium. However this is very unlikely, because the variations in DM caused\nby irregularities in the Galactic electron column density are at\nthe level \u03b4DM \u223c 0.05 cm\u22123 pc over the small angle subtended\nby the pulsars (Nordgren, Cordes, & Terzian 1992), while the\nvariations we observe are 10 times larger than this.\nWe conclude that the most likely cause of the observed DM\nvariations is the presence of a free electron plasma within the\ncluster, and estimate its density in the next section.\n\n\u22125\n\n\u22124\n\n\u22123\n\n\u22122\n\n\u22121\n0\n1\n\u221217 \u22121\n(P/P)obs(10 s )\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nF IG . 2.- Measured DM plotted against (\u1e56/P)obs for 15 millisecond pulsars.\nMost of the pulsars with negative (\u1e56/P)obs have significantly higher DMs than\nthose with positive (\u1e56/P)obs . The curves show the expected observed variation\nof (\u1e56/P) with DM along lines of sight passing through the cluster core (dotted)\nand passing 2 pc from the cluster core (dashed). These are calculated using the\ncluster mass distribution described in Freire et al. (2001), assuming that all the\npulsars have the same intrinsic h(\u1e56/P)int i, and that there is a uniform electron\ndensity of 0.067 cm\u22123 throughout the cluster. The vertical and horizontal lines\nrepresent the fitted values of h(\u1e56/P)int i and DMc as described in \u00a7 3.\n\n3. PLASMA DENSITY\n\nWe derive the plasma density in the central regions of 47 Tuc\nusing two different methods. In the first, and simpler method,\nthe density ne of a uniform plasma is obtained from the ratio\nof dispersion in measured DMs to the one-dimensional dispersion in offsets in the plane of the sky from the cluster center\n(Table 1):\nne \u2243\n\n\u03c3DM\n0.13 \u00b1 0.04 cm\u22123 pc\n=\n= 0.17 \u00b1 0.05 cm\u22123 , (1)\n\u03c3(\u03b8\u22a5 D)\n0.75 \u00b1 0.14 pc\n\nwhere we have used D = 5 kpc (Reid 1998), and assume a spherically symmetric distribution of pulsars.\nIn the second method we calculate the positions of the pulsars\nalong the line of sight from their period derivatives and compare\nthese with the DMs. The measured values of \u1e56/P are biased by\nthe intrinsic period derivative of each pulsar: with no a priori\nknowledge of (\u1e56/P)int for individual pulsars, we assume that\nall have the average value h(\u1e56/P)int i. Then, from the inferred\naccelerations a/c = (\u1e56/P)obs \u2212 h(\u1e56/P)int i and a King model for\nthe gravitational potential of the cluster (King 1966; see Freire\net al. 2001), we compute the distance R of each pulsar along\nthe line of sight from the plane of the sky containing the center of the cluster. Here we are assuming that a King model\nfor the potential computed with known cluster parameters, together with a relatively small contribution from (\u1e56/P)int , provides a good description for the observed values of \u1e56/P, which\nFreire et al. (2001) have shown to be the case. Using a uniform\nelectron density ne , we then calculate the incremental DM with\nrespect to the DM to the center of the cluster, DMc , required\nto obtain the observed DM for each pulsar. In summary, our\n\n\fFreire et al.\nmodel for the DMs contains the free parameters DMc , ne , and\nh(\u1e56/P)int i, and is represented by\nDMi = DMc + neRi ([\u1e56/P]obs i \u2212 h[\u1e56/P]int i),\n\n(2)\n\nthe cloud of ionized gas at the center of 47 Tuc is fairly homogeneous on \u223c pc scales, and that the King model (one simple\nchoice amid many possible ones; see Phinney 1993) provides a\nconsistent description for the potential of the cluster.\n\nwhere we have noted the explicit dependence of each pulsar's\nline-of-sight distance Ri on the inferred acceleration. There are\noften two distances at which a given a/c can be obtained (see\nFig. 2). We resolve this ambiguity by choosing the distance\nthat produces a model dispersion measure DM closest to the\nobserved value DM.\nWe determine the model parameters by minimizing\n(3)\n\ni=1\n\nand in order to obtain reliable uncertainty estimates in the derived parameters we implement this with a Monte Carlo procedure. We do so by generating 10,000 data sets where both\nthe observed pulsar DMs and relevant cluster parameters are\nchosen in a random fashion consistent with their measured uncertainties (distance: 5.0 \u00b1 0.4 kpc; Reid 1998; central stellar line-of-sight velocity dispersion: 11.6 \u00b1 1.4 km s\u22121 ; Meylan & Mayor 1986; angular core radius: 23.\u2032\u2032 1 \u00b1 1.\u2032\u2032 4; Howell,\nGuhathakurta, & Gilliland 2000).\nMinimization of \u03bc (eq. [3]) in the Monte Carlo procedure\nresulted in an average and rms for the model parameters2 of\nne = 0.067 \u00b1 0.015 cm\u22123 , DMc = 24.381 \u00b1 0.009 cm\u22123 pc and\nh(\u1e56/P)int i = (0.48 \u00b1 0.18) \u00d7 10\u221217 s\u22121 . The latter corresponds\nto an average \"characteristic age\" of h(P/2\u1e56)int i = 3 Gyr and an\naverage magnetic field of \u2248 3 \u00d7 108 Gauss for these 15 millisecond pulsars in 47 Tuc. The line-of-sight distances Ri and\nuncertainties resulting from the fitting procedure are displayed\nin Figure 3 and listed in Table 1.\nEach pulsar's (\u1e56/P)int is different from the average. In order to investigate the effect of this approximation in the evaluation of our model parameters we repeated the Monte Carlo\nprocedure described above, replacing h(\u1e56/P)int i with a value\nof (\u1e56/P)int for each pulsar drawn from a Gaussian distribution of characteristic ages centered on 5 Gyr with an rms of\n2.5 Gyr, truncated at the low end by the limits derived by Freire\net al. (2001). We repeated the procedure for a flat distribution\nof ages between 2 and 9 Gyr. Both distributions were chosen\nto be approximately representative of the distribution of characteristic ages observed for \u223c 30 millisecond pulsars in the\nGalactic disk. The results were similar in both cases, yielding parameters smaller by about 1 \u03c3 compared to the original\n\u22123\nmodel represented by equation (2): ne = 0.058+0.017\nand\n\u22120.012 cm\n\u22123\nDMc = 24.37 \u00b1 0.02 cm pc. Additionally, for three pulsars\nthe inferred distances Ri or their uncertainties changed significantly, owing to the prominence of the \"second solution\" in\nRi (a) (cf. Fig. 2), and are indicated in Table 1.\nIndividual DMs are affected by fluctuations in the Galactic\ncolumn density, as noted in \u00a7 2. There is also some uncertainty\nregarding the detailed form of the potential used to derive Ri\nfrom the inferred accelerations. And each pulsar's characteristic age is different from the average value determined in the\nmodel. All these factors contribute to the scatter visible in Figure 3. Nevertheless, the small scatter about the linear relation\nbetween DM and R emphasizes that the observations are consistent with two of the central assumptions made in the fit: that\n\nD\n24.7\nC\n\nJ\n\n24.6\nN\n\n\u22123\n\n(DMi \u2212 DMi ) ,\n2\n\n24.8\n\nDM (cm pc)\n\n\u03bc\u2261\n\n15\nX\n\n3\n\n24.5\nM\nI\n\n24.4\n\nT\nHF\nO\nU\n\n24.3\n\nG\nL\n\nQ\n\nE\n24.2\n\u22122\n\n\u22121\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n3\nR (pc)\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\nF IG . 3.- The measured DM plotted against the inferred line-of-sight distance of 15 pulsars from the plane of the sky containing the cluster center. A\nstrong correlation is observed, for which the inferred free electron density is\n0.067 \u00b1 0.015 cm\u22123 .\n\nThe values of ne derived by the methods represented by equations (1) and (2) agree at the 2 \u03c3 level, although the value derived in equation (1) is nominally higher than the one derived\nin the Monte Carlo procedure. This is partly due to the apparently smaller effective radius of the pulsar distribution in the\nplane of the sky (1.9 pc; Fig. 1), than along the line of sight\n(3.3 pc; Fig. 3). We attribute this apparent asphericity of the\npulsar distribution to small-number statistics (confirmed with\na KS test), and hereafter consider the pulsars to be distributed\nin a sphere with effective radius the geometrical mean of the\ntwo, r p = 2.5 pc. We also retain 0.067 \u00b1 0.015 cm\u22123 as the most\nprecise estimate for ne .\nEight pulsars with well-measured DM and (\u1e56/P)obs are also\nknown in the globular cluster M15. The DM variations among\nthese pulsars were interpreted by Anderson (1992) as arising\nfrom a gradient in the Galactic electron column density across\nthe cluster. As an alternative interpretation, we find the data for\nthe four millisecond pulsars (P < 10 ms) in M15 to be consistent with the existence of a homogeneous plasma with an electron density of about 0.2 cm\u22123 , slightly larger than in 47 Tuc.\nThe other pulsars in M15 have longer periods and likely have\nlarge contaminating values of (\u1e56/P)int .\n4. DISCUSSION\n\nUsing high precision pulsar timing applied to 15 pulsars observed in the globular cluster 47 Tuc, we have detected ionized intracluster gas with a density undetectable by other methods. Our measurement is consistent with previous upper limits for 47 Tuc (Hesser & Shawl 1977). The central electron\n\n2 In general the parameters obtained in this procedure are not Gaussian distributed. Where the difference is small we approximate to average and rms values, and\notherwise present the median and one-sided \"34%\" error bars.\n\n\f4\n\nIonized Gas in 47 Tuc\n\ndensity derived, ne = 0.07 cm\u22123 , compares to \u223c 0.0007 cm\u22123 for\nthe ISM in the vicinity of 47 Tuc, at a z-height of 3.5 kpc, and\n\u223c 0.02 cm\u22123 in the solar neighborhood (Taylor & Cordes 1993).\nWith a value of 0.07 cm\u22123 for the mean electron density and\nassuming that each electron is accompanied by a single proton, we obtain a plasma mass density \u03c1 \u223c 10\u221225 g cm\u22123 . Within\nthe approximately spherical region of radius r p = 2.5 pc occupied by the pulsars this corresponds to a total mass \u223c 0.1 M\u2299 .\nRecent ISO observations (Hopwood et al. 1999) put a strong\nupper limit of 2 \u00d7 10\u22124 M\u2299 on the dust content in 47 Tuc, so\nthat virtually any intracluster medium should be present as ionized or neutral gas. Moreover, we expect any gas present to\nbe completely ionized: the detection of hot stars in the cluster\n(Paresce et al. 1991; Guhathakurta et al. 1992; O'Connell et al.\n1997) indicates an intense background of UV photons, enough\nto ionize at least 10\u22123.5 M\u2299 yr\u22121 . This is more than enough to\ncompletely ionize the \u1e40 \u223c 10\u22125 M\u2299 yr\u22121 which is lost by all the\nevolved stars in a typical cluster (Roberts 1986). We therefore\nconclude that the detected plasma represents the total intracluster medium in the inner few pc.\nThe inferred \u223c 0.1 M\u2299 is much less than the \u223c 100 M\u2299 of intracluster material expected to accumulate within r p of the cluster core over a period of 107 \u2013108 yr (Roberts 1986). What process is then responsible for ejecting most of the gas from this region? Several different mechanisms have been proposed, most\nof which invoke winds such as those driven by main-sequence\nstars (Smith 1999), novae (Scott & Durisen 1978), M dwarfs\n(Coleman & Worden 1977), or pulsars. Indeed, Spergel (1991)\nproposed that 47 Tuc and other globular clusters should be devoid of any plasma, owing to the kinetic effects of strong winds\nfrom millisecond pulsars. Using the derived h(\u1e56/P)int i, the typ-\n\nical spin-down luminosity (\u221d \u1e56/P3 ) of a millisecond pulsar in\n47 Tuc is \u2248 1034 erg s\u22121 . Thus, the \u223c 1034 erg s\u22121 needed to expel 10\u22125 M\u2299 yr\u22121 from the cluster's potential, which requires an\nescape velocity of 58 km s\u22121 (Webbink 1985), can be provided\nby just \u223c 0.5% of the spin-down luminosity of the \u223c 200 pulsars believed to exist in the cluster (Camilo et al. 2000).\nIf we assume that mass loss within the central few pc of\nthe cluster is \u1e40 \u223c f \u00d7 10\u22125 M\u2299 yr\u22121 , with f of order unity\n(Roberts 1986), then a steady state situation implies that the\nplasma is being expelled from the inner r p = 2.5 pc with velocity v = \u1e40/(4\u03c0r2p \u03c1) \u223c f \u00d7 80 km s\u22121 , which is comparable to\nthe escape velocity of the cluster. Also, the existence of this\nplasma, together with sensitive X-ray limits on accretion luminosity from a central source, can be used to place an upper limit\non the mass of a central black hole of about 100 M\u2299 (Grindlay\net al. 2001).\nTo conclude, we have detected the long-sought intracluster\nmedium in a globular cluster, 47 Tucanae. It is somewhat ironic\nthat the very objects which allow us to detect the ionized gas\nmight also be responsible for its low concentration in the cluster.\nThe Parkes radio telescope is part of the Australia Telescope\nwhich is funded by the Commonwealth of Australia for operation as a National Facility managed by CSIRO.
