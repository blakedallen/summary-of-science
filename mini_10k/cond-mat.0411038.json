Langer and Ana\u00ebl Lema\u0131\u0302tre\n\narXiv:cond-mat/0411038v2 [cond-mat.mtrl-sci] 7 Apr 2005\n\nDepartment of Physics, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA 93106-9530 USA\n(Dated: January, 2005)\nSuper-Arrhenius relaxation rates in glassy materials can be associated with thermally activated\nrearrangements of increasing numbers of molecules at decreasing temperatures. We explore a model\nof such a mechanism in which string-like fluctuations in the neighborhood of shear transformation\nzones provide routes along which rearrangements can propagate, and the entropy associated with\ncritically long strings allows the rearrangement to be distributed stably in the surrounding material.\nWe further postulate that, at low enough temperatures, these fluctuations are localized on the\ninterfaces between frustration-limited domains, and in this way obtain a modified Vogel-Fulcher\nformula for the relaxation rate.\n\nRecent developments in the shear-transformation-zone\n(STZ) theory of amorphous plasticity [1, 2], especially\nits success in accounting for the behavior of bulk metallic\nglasses [3, 4], have prompted us to take a fresh look at the\nsuper-Arrhenius rates that characterize relaxation mechanisms in such materials. In our STZ calculations so far,\nwe have simply deduced these transition rates from measured linear viscosities and used them in predicting, for\nexample, nonlinear plastic responses to driving forces. To\nmake further progress, it will be useful to have a deeper\nunderstanding of the physical mechanism that underlies\nthese rates. (See [5] for a recent summary of a wide variety of research in this and related fields.)\nThe main assumption of the STZ theory is that a deformable glassy material is fundamentally an elastic solid\nin which irreversible molecular rearrangements occur at\nspecial sites \u2013 so called \"flow defects\" or \"STZ's.\"[6, 7, 8]\nThe STZ theory therefore differs from mode-coupling\ntheories [9, 10] whose starting point is a liquid-like model.\nOur version of STZ theory differs also from the earlier\nflow-defect theories in that it models the defects as twostate systems that carry information about the internal\nstate of the material. In this way, the theory describes\nboth the onset of plastic flow at a yield stress and a variety of memory effects.\nIn our most recent version of the STZ theory [4], we\ncharacterized the configurational degrees of freedom, i.e.\nthe inherent states of the system [11], by an effective\ndisorder temperature which, under nonequilibrium conditions, can be different from the temperature of the thermal bath. We supposed that the STZ's are especially deformable local density fluctuations that are far out in the\nwings of the effective thermal distribution. Our implicit\nassumption was that only a narrow range of these configurational fluctuations is sufficiently deformable yet populous enough to participate in plastic deformation. We are\nconcerned here with several different but closely related\ntransformation rates pertaining to the STZ's. Specifically, we want to compute the rate at which STZ's switch\nfrom one orientation to another during shear deformations, the rates at which they are created and annihilated,\nand the rate at which the effective temperature relaxes\n\ntoward the temperature of the heat bath. More generally, we are interested in the mechanisms by which an\namorphous solid makes transitions between its inherent\nstates.\nAs has long been recognized in theories of glass dynamics (e.g. see Adam and Gibbs [12]), a qualitative\nreason why transition rates become anomalously slow\nat low temperatures is that, as the temperature decreases, the statistically most probable transition states\nare those that involve increasingly large numbers of\nmolecules. There have been several recent attempts to\nmake this idea more precise. Notably, Xia and Wolynes\n[13] have postulated that the transitions are nucleated\nby liquid-like droplets characteristic of an incipient random first-order transition between solid-like and liquidlike (jammed and unjammed) phases. This postulate,\nplus some scaling analysis, produces the Vogel-Fulcher\nresult. An alternative picture has been proposed by Garrahan and Chandler [14], whose transitions are enabled\nby fluctuating patterns of mobile defects in an otherwise jammed system. The mobility of these defects \u2013\nas opposed to our immobile STZ's \u2013 produces distinctive behavior in this model. In particular, Garrahan and\nChandler conclude that relaxation times should obey the\nArrhenius formula only at low temperatures rather than,\nas is more commonly supposed, changing from Arrhenius to super-Arrhenius as the temperature decreases. So\nfar as we can tell, neither of these approaches attributes\nenough structure to the transition mechanism to describe\nthe stress-driven change from thermally assisted viscous\ncreep to superplastic flow that emerges from the present\nSTZ theory. Our purpose here is to examine a transition\nmechanism that relates directly to our dynamical model\nof the STZ's.\nThe model that we shall explore is motivated in part by\nwork of Glotzer and colleagues [15, 16], who discovered\nin molecular-dynamics simulations that transitions between inherent states in glass-forming liquids take place\nvia motions of string-like groups of molecules. We postulate that, at temperatures low enough that most of the\nsystem is tightly jammed, localized molecular rearrangements might be entropically enabled by strings of small\n\n\f2\nmolecular displacements that distribute the disturbance\nthroughout larger parts of the material. In granular materials, our hypothetical mechanism might be visualized\nas a kinetic fluctuation that allows molecules to undergo\nsmall displacements along a force chain.\nFor simplicity, consider first just the spontaneous STZ\ncreation rate, that is, the rate at which STZ's are created\nby thermal fluctuations in the absence of external driving. It is useful to think of STZ creation as an event in\nwhich the glassy analog of a vacancy and an interstitial\nfirst form, then move away from one another, and finally\nstabilize at an indefinitely large separation. More generally, the formation of an STZ is a spontaneous increase\nin the configurational disorder of the system, as measured by the intensity of density fluctuations. Suppose\nthat, with a probability that we must calculate, the material in the neighborhood of this event contains a string\nof relatively loose molecules that provides a route along\nwhich the \"vacancy\" and the \"interstitial\" can propagate.\nOur strategy is to estimate the height of the free-energy\nbarrier over which this system must fluctuate in order\nfor it to become energetically favorable for the string to\nlengthen without bound. When that happens, we postulate that a dynamically stable STZ has formed. In short,\nwe propose to solve a nucleation problem where the reaction coordinate is the length of this string. The entropy\nassociated with different string configurations is a measure of the number of routes across this energy barrier\nand, therefore (see [17]), reduces the free energy of the\nbarrier for purposes of computing the nucleation rate.\nTo describe the string model outlined in the preceding\nparagraphs, we let the string have length N in units of\nsome characteristic molecular length, say, l, and suppose\nthat it occupies a region of size R in the neighborhood\nof the emerging STZ. The total excess free energy of the\nsystem consists of several parts, which we denote:\n\u2206G(N, R, T ) = \u2206G\u221e + N e0 \u2212 T S(N, R) + Eint (N, R).\n(1)\nThe first term, \u2206G\u221e , is the bare activation energy for\nthe transition, that is, the energy required to form the\n\"vacancy\" and the \"interstitial.\" Until these two defects\nseparate from each other, it will be energetically favorable for them simply to recombine; thus, especially at low\ntemperatures, we need the string to enable the system to\nreach a stable configuration. At high enough temperatures, \u2206G\u221e ought to become the ordinary Arrhenius\nactivation energy.\nThe remaining terms on the right-hand side of Eq.(1)\ndescribe the string. e0 is the energy per unit step along it.\nS(N, R) is its entropy, which we obtain by computing the\nnumber of random walks of N steps extending a distance\nR. In the limit of large N , the number of such walks, say\nW (N, R), is approximately\n\u0013\n\u0012\nR2\nN\n,\n(2)\nW (N, R) \u2248 constant \u00d7 q exp \u2212\n2 N l2\n\nwhere q is the number of choices that the walk can make\nat each step. Thus,\nS(N, R) \u2248 \u03bd kB N \u2212 kB\n\nR2\n;\n2 N l2\n\n\u03bd = ln q.\n\n(3)\n\nThe last term in Eq.(1), Eint (N, R), is a repulsive interaction energy that accounts for the fact that no two\npieces of the string can occupy the same position at the\nsame time. This part of the analysis resembles Flory's\ncalculation of excluded-volume effects in polymers.[18]\nFollowing Flory, we assume that Eint (N, R) is approximately the square of the string density integrated over\nthe volume occupied by the string. Therefore, using\nFlory's mean-field approximation, also in the limit of\nlarge N , we write\nEint (N, R) \u2248 kB Tint\n\nN 2 ld\n,\nRd\n\n(4)\n\nwhere kB Tint is a repulsive energy (which contains dimensionless geometric factors) and d is the dimensionality of the space in which this string exists. As we shall\nargue, it is not necessarily true that d = 3.\nCombining these terms, we have\n\u2206G\u221e\n\u2206G(N, R, T )\n\u2248\n\u2212 \u03bd N (T \u2212 T0 )\nkB\nkB\n2\nN 2 ld\nR\n+\nT\n,\n+ T\nint\n2 N l2\nRd\n\n(5)\n\nwhere T0 \u2261 e0 /(\u03bd kB ). The activation barrier is a saddle\npoint in the N , R plane. That is, it is a minimum of\n\u2206G(N, R, T ) as a function of R (the smallest free energy\nfor fixed N ) and a maximum as a function of N (the highest point along the reaction path). The two R-dependent\nterms have a minimum at R = R\u2217 (N, T ), where\n[R\u2217 (N, T )]d+2 \u221d\n\nN3\n,\nT\n\n(6)\n\nwhich is the Flory expression for the swelling of a ddimensional polymer chain. Inserting this result into the\nR-dependent terms in (5), we find that the activation\nenergy has the following form as a function of N :\n\u2206G\u2217 (N, T ) = \u2206G(N, R\u2217 , T )\n\u2248 \u2206G\u221e + constant \u00d7 T d/(d+2) N (4\u2212d)/(d+2)\n\u2212 \u03bd N kB (T \u2212 T0 ).\n(7)\nThe second term on the right-hand side is positive and,\nfor 1 < d < 4, is dominant for small enough N ; the third\nterm dominates at large N . For T > T0 , the activation\nenergy goes through a maximum at N = N \u2217 (T ), where\nT d/(d+2)\nN (T ) \u221d\n(T \u2212 T0 )\n\u2217\n\n\u0014\n\nd+2\n\u0015 2 (d\u22121)\n\n.\n\n(8)\n\nAs in conventional nucleation theory, this fluctuation\nmost probably will collapse for N < N \u2217 , but will grow\n\n\f3\nwithout bound if N becomes larger than N \u2217 . Thus the\nactivation energy \u2206G\u2217 (T ) is the value of \u2206G\u2217 (N, T ) at\nits maximum, that is,\n\u2206G\u2217 (T ) = \u2206G(N \u2217 , R\u2217 , T )\nd\n\n\u2248 \u2206G\u221e + constant \u00d7\n\nT 2(d\u22121)\n4\u2212d\n\n. (9)\n\n(T \u2212 T0 ) 2(d\u22121)\nFor the naively expected case of d = 3, these results\nare entirely unsatisfactory. The T -dependent factor in\nthe activation energy, T 3/4 /(T \u2212 T0 )1/4 , has too weak\na divergence to be consistent with experimental data.\nMoreover, the energy scale is wrong. The implicit picture is one in which the string consists of a chain of N\nmonopolar, vacancy-like fluctuations, so that e0 would\nbe roughly equal to \u03bc l3 , where \u03bc is the shear modulus\nand l is the molecular length scale introduced previously.\nSuch an energy would be of the order of an electron volt,\nand would correspond to a temperature T0 in the range\nof 104 K \u2013 too large for our purposes by about two orders\nof magnitude.\nAn apparently more plausible picture, and one which\npertains specifically to the molecular structure of glassy\nmaterials, emerges from the concept of \"frustrationlimited domains,\" introduced by Kivelson et al. [19, 20].\nTheir idea is that, in a glass-forming material, the energetically preferred structure of small clusters of the\nconstituent molecules is one that cannot tile an infinite\nspace. That is, the energetically favorable short-range\norder is \"frustrated\" because it cannot extend over long\ndistances. Thus a quenched glass may consist of many\ndomains, inside of which the molecules have arranged\nthemselves so as to have their preferred local coordinations \u2013 or some approximation thereto; but these coordinations are violated on the interfaces between the domains. Accordingly, we speculate that the STZ activity\nis localized on a network of two-dimensional interfaces\nthat separate the domains. In addition to giving us a rationale for choosing d = 2 in the preceding analysis, this\nhypothesis allows the energy e0 to be much smaller than\nbefore, because the fluctuations are occurring in regions\nwhere the molecules already are more loosely bound to\neach other than they are within the bodies of the domains.\nChoosing d = 2 and restoring missing constants, we\nwrite Eqs. (6), (8), and (9) as follows:\n\u0012\n\u00131/2\n2 Tint\n[R\u2217 (N, T )]2 \u2248\nl2 N 3/2 ;\n(10)\nT\nN \u2217 (T ) \u2248\n\nTint T\n1\n;\n2 \u03bd 2 (T \u2212 T0 )2\n\n(11)\n\nand\n\u2206G\u221e\nTint T\n\u2206G\u2217 (T )\n\u2248\n+\n.\nkB\nkB\n2 \u03bd (T \u2212 T0 )\n\n(12)\n\nThis result exhibits the well-known Vogel-Fulcher linear\ndivergence at T = T0 ; therefore we know from earlier\nanalyses (e.g. see [20]) that it will agree with experimental data near the glass temperature.\nIn the limit T \u2192 \u221e, however, Eq.(12) predicts an\nexcess, Arrhenius-like activation energy of magnitude\nkB Tint /2 \u03bd. (The situation is worse in three dimensions,\nwhere the activation energy grows like T 1/2 at high temperatures.) This physically unrealistic high-temperature\nbehavior is a result of the fact that our large-N , meanfield approximations for the interaction energy and the\nentropy fail when N becomes small. In this limit, the\nstring disappears and the interaction energy should vanish accordingly; but our approximation says that the ratio N 2 /R2 in Eq.(4) goes to a constant. Note that the\nfailure of the large-N approximation, by definition, occurs at the same temperature where the system switches\nfrom super-Arrhenius to simple Arrhenius behavior. This\ntransition region apparently is where the system also\nswitches from being solid-like to liquid-like.\nThe theoretical analysis in [4] implies that the Newtonian viscosity \u03b7N (T ) can be written in the form\n\u03b7\u221e exp [\u2206G\u2217 (T )/kB T ] up to slowly varying logarithmic\ncorrections. In that analysis as well as here, the Arrhenius part of \u2206G\u2217 (T ), i.e. \u2206G\u221e , is the STZ formation energy; and the prefactor in the plastic strain rate, proportional to the Boltzmann factor exp (\u2212\u2206G\u221e /kB T ), is the\nequilibrium density of STZ's. The non-Arrhenius part of\n\u2206G\u2217 (T ) in Eq.(12) determines the nonequilibrium rate\nfactor denoted in [4] (up to a prefactor) by exp [\u2212\u03b1(T )];\nthat is, \u03b1(T ) \u2248 Tint /[2 \u03bd (T \u2212 T0 )]. Thus, in the spirit\nof Adam and Gibbs [12], our super-Arrhenius rates are\ntruly nonequilibrium quantities. They describe transitions between near-equilibrium, inherent states and not,\nas sometimes has been assumed, an equilibrium distribution associated with the states themselves. For example,\nit is assumed in [7, 21, 22, 23] that the equilibrium density\nof flow defects has a Vogel-Fulcher form; and the CohenGrest model [24] attributes super-Arrhenius behavior to\npercolation of liquid-like regions in equilibrated states.\nIn our opinion, the nonequilibrium interpretation is the\nmore natural of the two possibilities.\nIn Fig.(1), we illustrate both the agreement near T0\nand the asymptotic disagreement at higher temperatures by plotting \u2206G\u2217 (T ) obtained from our theory\nand from measurements of \u03b7N (T ) for the bulk metallic glass Zr41.2 Ti13.8 Cu12.5 Ni10 Be22.5 . We obtained the\nexperimental points by first fitting the high-T (above\nT \u223c\n= 900 K) part of the data in [26, 27] with the Arrhenius function \u03b7N \u223c\n= \u03b7\u221e exp (\u2206G\u221e /kB T ), finding\n\u03b7\u221e = 1.78 \u00d7 10\u221210 and \u2206G\u221e /kB T = 24300 K. We\nthen followed the procedure described in [25] and plotted\nT log (\u03b7/\u03b7\u221e ) as a function of the temperature. To compare this data with the prediction of Eq.(12), we used\n\u03bd = ln 4, T0 = 515 K and Tint = 2800 K. As expected,\nthe theory fails above T \u223c\n= 700 K.

The dashed\nline is a fit of the low temperature data with our theory. Parameters are \u2206G\u221e /kB = 24300 K, T0 = 515, Tint = 2800,\nand \u03bd = ln 4.\n\nnote, however, that the deformation measurements reported in [27] and discussed in [3, 4] were made in the lowtemperature regime, where Eq.(12) fits the data quite\nwell. (Our theoretical comparisons to data for structural\nglasses such as those discussed in [20] or [25] are qualitatively the same as that shown here for the metallic\nglass.)\nAlthough the failure of Eq.(12) at high temperatures is\nclearly related to a failure of our large-N approximations,\nwe believe that simply improving the mathematics of our\nstring model is not what is needed at this point. Rather,\nit seems to us that somehow we must construct a realistic\nmodel of the transition between solid-like and liquid-like\nglasses using physics that so far we have not brought to\nbear on this problem. The picture of a solid-like glass\nas a three dimensional mosaic of frustration-limited domains must break down at higher temperatures, where\nthe domains must become smaller and the active, liquidlike regions between them must occupy a larger fraction\nof the system. As this happens, our strings \u2013 or whatever\nreplaces them \u2013 must begin to look very different than\nthey do in our simple two-dimensional approximation.\nAt the most fundamental level, we believe we next must\nfind a way to describe how a solid-like theory of the kind\ndiscussed here crosses over to a mode-coupling theory of\na liquid-like glass forming material.\nThis research was supported primarily by U.S. Department of Energy Grant No. DE-FG03-99ER45762, and\n\n[1] M.L.
