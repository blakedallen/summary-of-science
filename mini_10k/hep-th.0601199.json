Introduction\nIn four dimensions a massive spin-s boson can be described via a totally symmetric\nrank-s tensor \u03c6 \u03bc1 ...\u03bcs subject to the conditions [1]\n(2 + m2 ) \u03c6 \u03bc1 ...\u03bcs = 0 ,\n\u2202 \u03bc1 \u03c6 \u03bc1 ...\u03bcs = 0 ,\n\u03c6\n\n\u03bd\n\u03bd\u03bc1 ...\u03bcs\u22122\n\n(1)\n\n= 0,\n\nwhere the two constraints on the trace and the divergence remove the polarizations not\nwithin a single irreducible representation of the Poincar\u00e9 Group. Their distinct role\nwas clearly recognized long ago by Fierz and Pauli [2] when they tried to analyze the\ninteraction with an electromagnetic field. While the first two equations in (1) became\nincompatible, the trace conditions proved harmless from the point of view of the minimal\nsubstitution, and they proposed to proceed in the search for an action principle leaving\nthem as algebraic constraints, a choice that was to influence all subsequent research\nin the field. The Fierz-Pauli program of constructing an action principle leading\nto eqs. (1) was completed only in 1974 by Singh and Hagen [3], who also confined\ntheir attention to massive fields, while the massless limit of their Lagrangians was\nsubsequently investigated by Fronsdal [4] and Fang and Fronsdal [5]. The resulting\nabelian gauge theories have been regarded since then as a paradigm for the free dynamics\nof higher-spin gauge fields.\nIn the Fronsdal equation for a spin-s boson,\nF\u03bc1 ...\u03bcs \u2261 2\u03c6\u03bc1 ...\u03bcs \u2212 (\u2202\u03bc1 \u2202 \u03c1 \u03c6\u03c1\u03bc2 ...\u03bcs + . . .) + (\u2202\u03bc1 \u2202\u03bc2 \u03c6 \u03c1\u03c1\u03bc3 ...\u03bcs + . . .) = 0, (2)\nwhere terms completing the symmetrizations are left implicit, the gauge field \u03c6 \u03bc1 ... \u03bcs is a\ntotally symmetric rank-s tensor subject to the condition that its double trace \u03c6\u03c1 \u03c3 \u03c1 \u03c3 \u03bc5 ...\u03bcs\nvanish identically, while the parameter \u039b\u03bc1 ...\u03bcs\u22121 entering the gauge transformation\n\u03b4 \u03c6 \u03bc1 ... \u03bcs = \u2202 \u03bc1 \u039b \u03bc2 ... \u03bcs + . . ., under which eq. (2) is invariant, is a traceless rank(s \u2212 1) tensor. Similar conditions are to be met for fermions, whose equations, for the\ncorresponding cases of symmetric rank-n spinor-tensors \u03c8 \u03bc1 ... \u03bcn , are\n6 \u03bc2 ... \u03bcn + . . .) = 0 .\nS \u03bc1 ... \u03bcn \u2261 6 \u2202 \u03c8 \u03bc1 ... \u03bcn \u2212 (\u2202\u03bc1 \u03c8\n\n(3)\n\nIn the fermionic case the triple \u03b3-trace of the gauge field is required to vanish,\n\u03b3 \u03b1 \u03b3 \u03b2 \u03b3 \u03b3 \u03c8 \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03bc4 ... \u03bcn \u2261 0, while the gauge parameter \u01eb\u03bc1 ...\u03bcn\u22121 , entering the\ntransformation law \u03b4 \u03c8 \u03bc1 ... \u03bcn = \u2202 \u03bc1 \u01eb \u03bc2 ... \u03bcn + . . . , is a symmetric rank-(n \u2212 1) spinortensor whose \u03b3-trace is required to vanish, \u03b3 \u03c1 \u01eb \u03c1 \u03bc2 ... \u03bcn\u22121 \u2261 0 . This class of higherspin gauge fields, while not exhaustive in more than four dimensions, is nonetheless a\nconvenient ground for arriving at general results, that can typically be extended to cases\nof mixed symmetry without major difficulties. Here, following a common practice, in\narbitrary dimensions we shall often call loosely \"spin\" the rank s of the bosonic gauge\nfields, or the rank n of the fermionic fields augmented by 12 .\nThese trace and \u03b3\u2212trace constraints, that as we have stressed are somehow a legacy\nof similar conditions on the massive fields of [2], appear somewhat unpleasing, and thus\n\n\fHigher-Spin Geometry and String Theory\n\n3\n\nwe were motivated to reformulate the theory in such a way as to bypass them. Actually,\na positive answer to this query had already been given by Pashnev, Tsulaia, Buchbinder\nand others in [6, 7], where the free dynamics of individual and unconstrained higher-spin\ngauge fields was first described via BRST techniques [8]. Their construction, however,\nrequires many additional fields, their total number increasing linearly with the spin.\nThis is to be contrasted with the approach resulting from our investigations [9, 10],\nthat is being reviewed here, that removes the trace constraints from the Fronsdal and\nFang-Fronsdal Lagrangians for all spins via at most a pair of additional fields.\nA convenient starting point for our constructions are the Lagrangians related to\neqs. (2) and (3), here written for unconstrained fields that transform with unconstrained\ngauge parameters. Whereas under these conditions the Lagrangians are not gauge\ninvariant, in Section 2 we shall see that in the bosonic case a rank-(s \u2212 3) compensator\nfield \u03b1 \u03bc1 ...\u03bcs\u22123 transforming as \u03b4 \u03b1 \u03bc1 ...\u03bcs\u22123 = \u039b\u03c1 \u03c1 \u03bc1 ...\u03bcs\u22123 , suffices to eliminate from\nthe variation all terms involving the trace of the gauge parameter. Interestingly, the\nremainder is then proportional to the gauge invariant combination\n\u03c6 \u03c1 \u03c3\u03c1 \u03c3 \u03bc5 ... \u03bcs \u2212 4 \u2202 * \u03b1 \u03bc5 ...\u03bcs \u2212 (\u2202\u03bc5 \u03b1 \u03c1\u03c1\u03bc6 ...\u03bcs + . . . ) ,\n\n(4)\n\nand as a result once this last constraint is enforced by a Lagrange multiplier \u03b2 one ends\nup with fully gauge invariant Lagrangians, whose equations of motion, as reviewed in\nSection 3, propagate indeed the correct polarizations. Similar results hold for fermionic\nfields as well: in all cases (including actually the BRST formulations of [6, 7], as shown\nin [11]), the field equations can be reduced to the local non-Lagrangian compensator\nequations of [12, 11], that in the bosonic case read simply\nF\u03bc1 ...\u03bcs = 3 \u2202\u03bc1 \u2202\u03bc2 \u2202\u03bc3 \u03b1\u03bc4 ...\u03bcs + . . . ,\n\u03c6\u03c1\u03c3 \u03c1\u03c3\u03bc5 ...\u03bcs = 4 \u2202 * \u03b1\u03bc5 ...\u03bcs + (\u2202\u03bc5 \u03b1\u03c1 \u03c1\u03bc6 ...\u03bcs + . . . ) ,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u03b1 denotes the rank-(s \u2212 3) compensator defined above.\nIn Section 4 we shall review how the additional fields can be eliminated without\nreintroducing any trace constraints: the end result will be a non-local theory along the\nlines of [13, 12]. For instance, for spin three the non-local equations one obtains are\n1\n( \u2202\u03bc1 \u2202\u03bc2 F \u03c1 \u03c1\u03bc3 + \u2202\u03bc2 \u2202\u03bc3 F \u03c1 \u03c1\u03bc1 + \u2202\u03bc3 \u2202\u03bc1 F \u03c1 \u03c1\u03bc2 ) = 0 , (6)\nF\u03bc1 \u03bc2 \u03bc3 \u2212\n32\nwhere F is defined in (2). The dynamical content of this theory is again the usual one\nof the Fronsdal formulation, as we shall see following [13, 12, 10].\nGiven the relative simplicity of the local formulation, the actual interest in the\nnon-local equations is mostly driven by conceptual issues. Their most appealing feature\nis indeed a direct link to the geometry of these higher-spin fields, since the non-local\nequations obtained eliminating the additional fields confer a dynamical meaning to the\nhigher-spin curvatures introduced in [14] by de Wit and Freedman, that do not play\na direct role in the Fronsdal formulation. As will be explained in Section 5, these\ncurvatures involve as many derivatives as the spin of the basic fields, and for this simple\nreason they can only enter two-derivative equations provided they are accompanied by\n\n\fHigher-Spin Geometry and String Theory\n\n4\n\ninverse powers of the d'Alembertian operator, but all resulting non-localities can be\nconsistently eliminated by a partial gauge-fixing procedure involving the trace of the\ngauge parameter. The end result of this procedure was anticipated in [13], and has the\nsuggestive feature of being a direct generalization of the geometric equations known for\nthe more familiar spin-one and spin-two cases. Thus, if R\u03bc1 \u03bc2 \u03bc3 , \u03c11 \u03c12 \u03c13 is the curvature\nfor the spin-three case, fully symmetric within the two sets of indices, it is possible to\nshow that the non-local equation (6) can be written in the form\n1 \u03c11 \u03c12 \u03c3\n\u03b7\n\u2202 R \u03c3\u03c11 \u03c12 , \u03bc1 \u03bc2 \u03bc3 = 0 ,\n(7)\n2\nwhere \u03b7 \u03c11 \u03c12 denotes the flat Minkowski metric, a direct generalization of the spin-one\nMaxwell equation. In a similar fashion, for spin four, the first non-trivial even-spin case,\nthe non-local geometric equations take the form [13, 12]\n1 \u03c11 \u03c12 \u03c13 \u03c14\n\u03b7\n\u03b7\nR \u03c11 \u03c12 \u03c13 \u03c14 , \u03bc1 \u03bc2 \u03bc3 \u03bc4 = 0 ,\n(8)\n2\nin clear analogy with the linearized spin-two Einstein equation. It should be appreciated\nthat the spin-one and spin-two cases are the only ones for which these geometric\nequations are local.\nThe need for a better understanding of the relation between Higher-Spin Gauge\nTheory and String Theory is a serious motivation behind the interest in the former\nthat is building up nowadays, and some elementary related issues will be reviewed in\nSection 6, where free equations emerging from String Field Theory [15] in the lowtension limit will be compared with the compensator equations (5). In that limit, as\nwas known for a long time, the structure of the String equations simplifies to systems\nof three fields usually called \"triplets\" [16, 12, 17] (or their fermionic analogues of\n[12], or generalizations thereof [16, 11]). In all cases, the resulting fields are not\nsubject to any trace constraints and display a correspondingly unconstrained gauge\nsymmetry. A consistent truncation of the propagating modes then suffices to recover\nthe local compensator equations (5) for spin-s bosons and corresponding ones for spin(n + 12 ) fermions. This result and its generalizations to the mixed-symmetry case\n[11] can be taken as a hint that the unconstrained formulation should be of help in\nunraveling the precise relationship between higher-spin systems and String theory at the\ninteracting level. A precise statement to this effect, however, would still require further\ninvestigation, in particular since at present the only window on consistent higher-spin\ninteractions is provided by the Vasiliev construction [18, 19, 20], which is strictly an onshell formulation. We shall therefore conclude in Section 7 with some cursory remarks\non the role of the unconstrained gauge symmetry in this construction, following [23].\nThe key result will be that the extended symmetry can indeed be accommodated in\nthe free Vasiliev equations based on vector oscillators [19], that are actually closer in\nspirit to an off-shell form than their original version of [18] based on spinor oscillators.\nInterestingly, the compensators \u03b1 do not appear explicitly in the equations. Rather,\nthey emerge as exact forms of a generalized cohomological problem first discussed by\nDubois-Violette and Henneaux [24].\n\n\fHigher-Spin Geometry and String Theory\n\n5\n\nIn order to simplify the discussion, in the following we shall resort to a concise\nnotation that we found quite useful in our previous works. Thus, primes (or bracketed\nsuffixes) will denote traces, while all indices carried by the symmetric tensors \u03c6\u03bc1 ...\u03bcs\nand \u039b\u03bc1 ...\u03bcs\u22121 , by the metric tensor \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd or by derivatives will be left implicit.

(5). As was the case for the Fronsdal operator F (see eq. (14)),\nits Bianchi identity contains a violation related to the double trace of the gauge field \u03c6,\nthat does not allow one to regard A \u2212 \u03b7/2A\u2032 as a proper linearized Einstein-like tensor\nfor higher spins. The key difference with respect to the Fronsdal operator, however, is\nthat now the fully gauge invariant combination (13) is involved, so that\n3\n1\n(20)\n\u2202 * A \u2212 \u2202 A \u2032 = \u2212 \u2202 3 (\u03c6 \u2032\u2032 \u2212 4 \u2202 * \u03b1 \u2212 \u2202 \u03b1 \u2032 ).\n2\n2\n\n\fHigher-Spin Geometry and String Theory\n\n7\n\nThe trial Lagrangian L0 has therefore a simple variation, that can be nicely expressed\nin terms of a pair of gauge-invariant quantities:\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0012 \u0013\ns\n3 s\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2202 * \u2202 * \u2202 * \u039b (\u03c6 \u2032\u2032 \u2212 4\u2202 * \u03b1 \u2212 \u2202\u03b1 \u2032 ) .\n(21)\n\u039b \u2202*A +3\n\u03b4L0 =\n4\n4 3\nIn the same spirit as above, but in a simpler fashion, it is now possible to compensate\nthis remainder introducing the fields \u03b1 and \u03b2, and the complete Lagrangian is then\nsimply\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0012\n1\ns\n3\u03b1 s\n1\n\u2032\n\u2032\nL = \u03c6 A \u2212 \u03b7A \u2212\n(\u03c6 \u2032\u2032 \u2212 4\u2202 * \u03b1 \u2212 \u2202\u03b1 \u2032 ) .(22)\n\u2202*A \u22123 \u03b2\n4\n2\n2\n4 3\nThis alternative way of presenting (16) has the virtue of allowing handy\ngeneralizations to the cases of (A)dS backgrounds, that will presented elsewhere [29].\nSimilar results that hold for fermion fields are not discussed here for brevity, but can be\nfound in [9, 10, 29].\n3. Structure and meaning of the field equations\nIn the previous Section we have reviewed how invariant bosonic Lagrangians can be\nbuilt introducing at most two additional fields. Differently from the Fronsdal fields,\nthe gauge fields \u03c6 involved in this description are not subject to any trace constraints,\nand in order to check the consistency of the result one would thus like to display the\ndynamical content of eq. (16). To this end let us consider the field equations, and let us\nshow that they can be reduced to the Fronsdal equations (2) by a partial gauge fixing.\nThe equations following from the Lagrangian (16) for the fields \u03c6 , \u03b2 and \u03b1 are of\nthe form\n1\nA \u2212 \u03b7 B + \u03b72 C = 0 ,\n2\n\u03c6 \u2032\u2032 \u2212 4 \u2202 * \u03b1 \u2212 \u2202 \u03b1 \u2032 = 0 ,\n(23)\nG\u03c6,\u03b2 (\u03b1) = 0 ,\nwith\nA \u2261 F \u2212 3\u22023\u03b1,\n\n(24)\n\nwhere the explicit expressions for B, C and G, not needed for the present discussion, can\nbe found in [9]. It should be noted that, when \u03b2 is on-shell, the first of (23) reduces to\n1\n(25)\nA \u2212 \u03b7 A \u2032 + \u03b72 C = 0 ,\n2\nwhile the double trace of A vanishes identically. A straightforward analysis [9, 10] then\nshows that the equation for \u03c6 implies the independent relations C = 0, A \u2032 = 0, and\nfinally the first of (5),\nA \u2261 F \u2212 3\u22023\u03b1 = 0.\n\n(26)\n\nOnce this form is reached, the Fronsdal equation (2) can be directly recovered after a\npartial gauge fixing, making use of the trace \u039b\u2032 of the gauge parameter, that can shift\n\n\fHigher-Spin Geometry and String Theory\n\n8\n\naway the field \u03b1, while the second of (23) removes at the same time the double trace of\nthe gauge field \u03c6.\nThis discussion completes the proof that the Fronsdal theory is gauge equivalent\nto the unconstrained formulation. Nonetheless, the unconstrained Lagrangians possess\na wider gauge symmetry, and one may wonder whether this could play a role in the\nnon-linear deformations of the theory.\nThe first hint that the wider gauge symmetry can imply some relevant differences\nwith the Fronsdal theory as soon as one moves away from the free case can be appreciated\ncomparing the properties of external currents coupled to the physical fields in the two\napproaches. Let us indeed introduce the coupling to an external source J in the standard\nfashion, adding to the Lagrangian (16) a \u03c6 * J term. The equations of motion become\nin this case\n1\nA \u2212 \u03b7 B + \u03b72 C = J ,\n2\n\u03c6 \u2032\u2032 \u2212 4 \u2202 * \u03b1 \u2212 \u2202 \u03b1 \u2032 = 0 ,\n(27)\nG\u03c6,\u03b2 (\u03b1) = 0 ,\nand it is possible to show that the divergence of the left-hand side of the first equation\nis proportional to the operator G defining the field equation of \u03b1 [9, 10]. Explicitly,\nthe divergence of the first equation in (27) gives \u03b74 G\u03c6,\u03b2 (\u03b1) = \u2202 * J , and therefore,\nbecause of the third of (27), the source must be divergence-free on-shell, as expected\nfrom Noether's theorem. This result shows that the properties of the unconstrained\nsystem are consistent with physical expectations for the most natural interactions in a\nField Theory, and marks a sizeable difference with the Fronsdal scheme. In this last\ncase, in fact, the corresponding equations are\n1\nF \u2212\n\u03b7 F\u2032 = J,\n(28)\n2\nand consequently their divergence yields \u2212 12 \u03b7 \u2202 * F \u2032 = \u2202 * J . Hence, while for s = 1, 2\nthe usual condition \u2202 * J = 0 is recovered, in Fronsdal's theory from spin s = 3 onwards\nconsistency only implies the weaker condition that the traceless part of the divergence\nvanish. Although sufficient to guarantee that only physical polarizations contribute to\nthe exchange of quanta between sources [4], this does not completely fit the conditions\nfor a Noether current. An equivalent argument can be given for fermions, as in [9, 10].\n4. Removing the additional fields: non-local formulation\nIn this Section we would like to show that it is possible to eliminate the auxiliary fields\nfrom the unconstrained theory to recover a formulation which is closer in spirit to the\nfamiliar cases of spin one or two [12, 10]. The resulting dynamics is not local, but it is\nagain possible to reduce it to the local Fronsdal form by a partial gauge fixing involving\nthe trace of the gauge parameter.\nThe idea is to look for minimal combinations of the F operator with its traces and\ndivergences, not involving \u03b1 and such that the resulting expression vanishes identically\n\n\fHigher-Spin Geometry and String Theory\n\n9\n\nwhen the first of (5) is satisfied. In the spin-3 case one can find in this fashion two\nindependent, fully gauge invariant, unconstrained equations of this type,\n1 \u22022 \u2032\nF = 0,\n(29)\nF \u2212\n3 2\n\u22023\nF \u2212 2 \u2202 * F\u2032 = 0.\n(30)\n2\nThe second can be obtained combining the first with its trace, but is anyway quite\ninteresting, since it is of the form\nF = 3 \u2202 3 H(\u03c6) ,\n\n(31)\n\nwhere H(\u03c6) = 3 21 2 \u2202 * F \u2032 is such that \u03b4 H(\u03c6) = \u039b \u2032 . In other words, the non-local\nconstruct H plays the role of the compensator \u03b1!\nWe have thus seen that in the spin-3 case it is possible to eliminate \u03b1 from the\ncompensator equation arriving at a fully gauge invariant equation for the single field \u03c6,\nwithout reintroducing any trace constraints. The irreducible equation is not local, as\nanticipated, but can be cast into the particularly useful form (31), in which it is manifest\nthat using only of the trace \u039b\u2032 of the gauge parameter all non localities can be removed,\nthus recovering the Fronsdal form F = 0.\nFor bosons of arbitrary spin s one can reproduce the scheme just described for spin\n3: starting from the first of (5), it is possible to find a linear combination of constructs\nbuilt from F that vanishes identically and does not involve \u03b1, without reintroducing any\ntrace constraints [13, 12]. To this end, let us define F (1) \u2261 F and let us consider the\nsequence of kinetic operators\n\u2202 2 (n) \u2032\n1 \u2202\n1\n(n+1)\n(n)\nF\n\u2212\n\u2202 * F (n) .\n(32)\nF\n= F +\n(n + 1)(2n + 1) 2\nn+1 2\nThey possess the crucial property that we need, since eqs. (5) and (32) imply that\n\u2202 2n+1 [n\u22121]\n\u03b1\n.\n(33)\n2 n\u22121\n}, the trace \u03b1[p+1] of the\nHence, for any spin s, if p denotes the integer part of { s\u22123\n2\ncompensator is simply not available, and hence the non-local kinetic operator F (p+2)\nsatisfies the irreducible gauge-invariant equation\n\u03b4 F (n) = (2n + 1)\n\nF (p+2) = 0 ,\n\n(34)\n\nwhere the compensator \u03b1 has disappeared. Moreover, these kinetic operators satisfy the\nmodified \"Bianchi identities\" [13, 12]\n\u0013 2n+1\n\u0012\n\u2202\n1\n1\n(n) \u2032\n(n)\n\u2202F\n= \u2212 1+\n\u03c6[n+1] .\n(35)\n\u2202*F \u2212\nn\u22121\n2n\n2n 2\nwhere for n sufficiently large the classical \"anomaly\" also disappears, so that they\neventually suffice to define for all spin-s fields fully gauge invariant analogues of the\nEinstein tensor,\nX\n(\u22121)p\n\u0010 \u0011 \u03b7 p F (n) [p] ,\nG(n) =\n(36)\nn\np p !\n2\np\u2264n\np\n\n\fHigher-Spin Geometry and String Theory\n\n10\n\nthat have vanishing divergences like their spin-2 counterpart. From G(n) one can then\nbuild generalized Lagrangians that are fully gauge invariant without any restrictions on\ngauge fields or gauge parameters. Making use repeatedly of eq. (35), it is also possible\nto show that eqs. (34) can always be reduced to the compensator-like form (31) and\nthen finally gauge fixed to the local Fronsdal form [10]. Again, similar results hold for\nfermion fields, but are not discussed here for brevity and can be found in [13, 12, 10].\n5. Higher-spin geometry from the non-local formulation\nThe non-local formulation, although dynamically equivalent to the local one, is clearly\nless manageable, both at the classical and at the quantum level. So, what advantages\ncan it possibly have? Briefly stated, as we shall review in this Section, the non-local\nformulation encodes a geometric description, for all higher spins, along lines familiar\nfrom the two cases of spin-one and spin-two fields.\nIn order to motivate and explain this statement, our starting point will be provided\nby the hierarchy of \"connections\" introduced by de Wit and Freedman in [14], that\nagain can be nicely motivated by a closer look at the first non-trivial case of a spin-3\nboson. In analogy with the two lower-spin cases, the key idea is to consider a linear\ncombination of first derivatives of the basic field \u03c6\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 such that the resulting gauge\ntransformation be as simple as possible. The proper choice is\n(1)\n\n\u0393\u03c1,\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 = \u2202\u03c1 \u03c6\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 \u2212 (\u2202\u03b1 \u03c6\u03c1\u03b2\u03b3 + \u2202\u03b2 \u03c6\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3 + \u2202\u03b3 \u03c6\u03b1\u03b2\u03c1 ) ,\n\n(37)\n\nsince indeed\n(1)\n\n\u03b4\u0393\u03c1,\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 = \u2212 2(\u2202\u03b1 \u2202\u03b2 \u039b\u03c1\u03b3 + \u2202\u03b1 \u2202\u03b3 \u039b\u03c1\u03b2 + \u2202\u03b2 \u2202\u03b3 \u039b\u03c1\u03b1 ) ,\n\n(38)\n\nwhere for the sake of clarity all indices have been displayed. It is possible to simplify\nfurther the gauge transformation taking a combination of second derivatives of \u03c6: the\nproper choice is now\n1\n(1)\n(2)\n(1)\n(39)\n\u0393\u03c1\u03c3,\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 = \u2202\u03c1 \u0393\u03c3,\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 \u2212 (\u2202\u03b1 \u0393\u03c3,\u03c1\u03b2\u03b3 + . . .) ,\n2\nsince the resulting variation is simply\n(2)\n\n\u03b4 \u0393\u03c1\u03c3,\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 = 3 \u2202\u03b1 \u2202\u03b2 \u2202\u03b3 \u039b\u03c1\u03c3 ,\n\n(40)\n\nthat resembles more closely the behavior of the spin-2 Christoffel connection or of the\nspin-1 gauge field. In this respect, for spin 3 this \u0393(2) , more than \u0393(1) , is what one\nwould properly call a \"connection\", and indeed a sort of \"symmetric curl\" of \u0393(2) builds\na gauge invariant \"curvature\" for the spin 3 field \u03c6:\n1\n(2)\n(3)\n(3)\n(2)\n(41)\n\u0393 \u03c1\u03c3\u03c4, \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 \u2261 R \u03c1\u03c3\u03c4, \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 = \u2202 \u03c1 \u0393 \u03c3\u03c4, \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3 \u2212 (\u2202 \u03b1 \u0393 \u03c3\u03c4, \u03c1\u03b2\u03b3 + . . .) .\n3\nIn order to deal with the general case, one can follow a strategy that should be\n(m)\nclear from the previous example, the key observation being that in each \u0393 \u03c11 ... \u03c1m , \u03b11 ... \u03b1s\nthe two groups of indices are not equivalent. The \u03c1's are \"special\" indices, related to the\nintroduction of m derivatives at the m-th step, and the combinations should be chosen\n\n\fHigher-Spin Geometry and String Theory\n\n11\n\nin such a way that in the gauge variation of \u0393(m) the special indices end within the gauge\nparameter \u039b \u03bc1 ... \u03bcs\u22121 . If this is attained, in the gauge transformation of \u0393(s\u22121) all indices\nbelonging to the gauge parameter will be special ones, and consequently \u0393(s) (along with\nany \u0393(s+k) for k > 0) will be necessarily gauge invariant, simply because there will be no\nroom in \u039b to accommodate more special indices. In order to present these results in a\ncompact fashion, let us resort to a mixed notation, in which the \"\u2202\" symbol is reserved\nfor derivatives with respect to \"special\" indices while \"\u25bd\" is taken to denote derivatives\nwith respect to the remaining ones. Bearing in mind that symmetrization only applies\nto pairs of indices within each of the two sets, one could write the de Wit-Freedman\nsymbols in the form\nm\nX\n(\u22121)k m\u2212k k\n(m)\n\u0001 \u2202\n\u25bd \u03c6,\n(42)\n\u0393\n=\nm\nk=0\n\nk\n\nand the corresponding gauge transformations,\n\n\u03b4 \u0393(m) = (\u22121)m (m + 1) \u25bd m+1 \u039b ,\n\n(43)\n\nthen display their direct correspondence with the kinetic operators F (n) of the previous\nSection (see eq. (33). In particular, in this notation the gauge-invariant curvatures\nbecome\ns\nX\n(\u22121)k s\u2212k k\n(s)\n\u0001 \u2202\n\u25bd \u03c6.\n(44)\nR =\ns\nk=0\n\nk\n\nThese curvatures can not be used directly to describe the Fronsdal dynamics, simply\nbecause they are higher-derivative objects, and this was the reason why the authors of\n[14] rejected the possibility of describing higher-spin fields in an unconstrained fashion,\nreturning at the end of their analysis to the constrained Fronsdal formulation. And\nindeed, if one assumes that \u039b \u2032 \u2261 0, the trace of each connection in the hierarchy is also\ngauge invariant, and in particular the trace of the \u0393 (2) defines a gauge invariant second\norder operator, that coincides with F and in [14] was chosen to define the field equation,\nthus justifying Fronsdal's result from a different viewpoint.\nNonetheless, one can well try and describe via the curvatures (44) an\n\"effective\" second-order dynamics, acting on them with suitable inverse powers of the\nd'Alembertian operator in order to recover the physical dimensions of a second-order\noperator. The resulting geometric equations [13, 12]\n1\nR[n] \u03bc1 ***\u03bc2n = 0 ,\n(s = 2 n) ,\n(45)\nn\u22121\n2\n1\n\u2202 * R[n\u22121] \u03bc1 ***\u03bc2n\u22121 = 0 , (s = 2 n + 1) ,\n(46)\nn\n2\nare a nice way of encoding the results of the previous Section, once the curvatures are\nidentified with suitably iterated F (n) operators. These geometric equations are natural\ngeneralizations of the well-known spin-1 and spin-2 cases, are of course non-local on\naccount of our preceding arguments, but as we have reviewed in previous Sections the\nnon local terms are harmless gauge artifacts, as was the case for the non-local terms in\n\n\fHigher-Spin Geometry and String Theory\n\n12\n\nthe equivalent kinetic operators (32). These equations were generalized to the case of\nmixed symmetry in [30, 31].\nIn conclusion, the curvatures of de Wit and Freedman acquire a direct dynamical\nmeaning in the non-local theory, whose equivalence to the local unconstrained one has\nbeen discussed in the previous Section. This description embodies the linearized forms\nof the non-linear Yang-Mills and Einstein equations, for spin 1 and 2 respectively, and\nleads naturally to speculate that a currently unknown non-linear metric-like geometry\n(to be contrasted with Vasiliev's frame-like geometry [18, 19, 20]) could alternatively be\ntaken to underlie higher-spin interactions, in such a way as to give rise to eqs. (45) and\n(46) in the linearized limit. Similar results hold for fermionic fields, and are discussed\nin some detail in [10].\n6. Higher-spin geometry and String Field Theory\nHigher-spin states are an intrinsic, inevitable part of the string spectrum. Hence, it is\nnatural to look for links between these properties of higher-spin fields and what can be\ndeduced from String Field Theory in the linearized approximation.\nIn this Section we would thus like to review briefly how the unconstrained\nformulation of free higher-spin gauge fields can be related to the low-tension limit of free\nString Field Theory. We shall depart slightly from [12, 11], and follow [10]. As shown\nin [15], in all cases the free equations of String Field Theory can be written in the form\nQ |\u03a6i = 0 ,\n\n(47)\n\nwhere Q is the BRST operator of the first-quantized string. These systems display the\nchain of gauge invariances\n\u03b4|\u03a6(n) i = Q |\u03a6(n+1) i ,\n\n(48)\n\nwith \u03a6(1) the string gauge field and \u03a6(n) (n > 1) a corresponding chain of gauge\nparameters.\nIn the usual case of tensile strings, these equations describe massive higher-spin\nmodes, with masses determined by the string tension, but it is important to stress\nthat neither (47) nor (48) involve trace conditions. Hence, it is reasonable to expect\nthat in the low-tension limit \u03b1 \u2032 \u2192 \u221e the resulting massless dynamics should naturally\nrelate to the unconstrained formulation reviewed in the previous Sections, rather than\nto Fronsdal's constrained equations.\nEven for the open bosonic string, the complete analysis of the spectrum would\nrequire to deal with mixed-symmetry tensors, as discussed in [11]. Here it will suffice to\nnote that for symmetric tensors (corresponding to states in the leading Regge trajectory\nof the open bosonic string, generated by the lowest string oscillators \u03b1\u22121 ) the limit\n\u03b1 \u2032 \u2192 \u221e yields triplet systems of the type [16, 12, 17]\n2\u03c6 = \u2202 C ,\n\u2202 * \u03c6 \u2212 \u2202D = C,\n2D = \u2202 * C ,\n\n(49)\n\n\fHigher-Spin Geometry and String Theory\n\n13\n\nwhere \u03c6, C and D are symmetric tensors of ranks s, s \u2212 1 and s \u2212 2 respectively. Notice\nthat no trace constraints are enforced on these fields, while these equations are invariant\nunder the unconstrained gauge transformations\n\u03b4\u03c6 = \u2202 \u039b,\n\u03b4C = 2\u039b,\n\n(50)\n\n\u03b4D = \u2202 *\u039b.\nIn order to establish contact with the unconstrained equations of the preceding\nSections, one can proceed as in [13], or alternatively one can manipulate eq. (49) in\norder to reproduce the Fronsdal operator (2), as in [10]. In particular, making use of\nthe second of (49) to express the gradient of \u2202 * \u03c6 in terms of C and D according to\n\u2202 \u2202 * \u03c6 = 2\u22022D + \u2202 C ,\n\n(51)\n\nand taking a double gradient of the trace of the first, after dividing by the d'Alembertian\noperator one can arrive at\n\u22023 \u2032\nC .\n2\nPutting together (51) and (52) with the first of (49), the final result,\n\u2202 2 \u03c6\u2032 = 2 \u2202 2 D + 3\n\n(52)\n\n\u22023 \u2032\nC ,\n(53)\n2\nis clearly of the form (5), with the identification of \u03b1 with 21 C \u2032 . And indeed, starting\nfrom the third of the triplet equations one can also arrive at\n\u2202 \u2032\u2032\n1\nC .\n(54)\n\u03c6 \u2032\u2032 = 4 \u2202 * C \u2032 +\n2\n2\nNotice that in this fashion one has truncated all modes that are responsible for the\npropagation of lower spins (s \u2212 2), (s \u2212 4), . . . in the triplet, so that the end result is to\nexhibit a direct link between the (truncated) triplet (49) and the compensator equations\n(5). To reiterate, in the low-tension limit the equations of String Field Theory for fully\nsymmetric tensors bear a direct relationship to the unconstrained formalism for higher\nspins reviewed in Section 2 of this paper, and hence to the non-local geometric equations\nreviewed in Section 3. Similar results hold for mixed-symmetry tensors [11], and for\nfermion fields [12, 11, 10], but are not discussed here for the sake of brevity.\nF = 3\n\n7. Unconstrained gauge symmetry and the Vasiliev equations\nAt present not much is known in a systematic fashion about higher-spin interactions,\naside from the fact that they are bound to involve infinitely many fields, but a remarkable\nexample is available. Consistent non-linear interactions for an infinite set of fully\nsymmetric tensors can be elegantly encoded in the Vasiliev equations [18, 19, 20], a set of\ncurvature constraints relating a one-form master field A containing the higher-spin fields\nand a zero-form master field \u03a6 subsuming the content of corresponding Weyl curvatures\n(as well as an independent scalar mode). These fields may also be matrix-valued, in\n\n\fHigher-Spin Geometry and String Theory\n\n14\n\nanalogy with standard Chan-Paton [21] constructions, which suggests a natural link\nwith the leading Regge trajectory of open bosonic strings. The key idea behind these\nequations is to bypass the standard S-matrix no-go theorems for higher-spin interactions\nby introducing a cosmological term [22], that builds naturally an expansion about dS or\nAdS backgrounds rather than around flat space, and to generalize the frame formulation\nof gravity to higher spins by properly extending the SO(1, D) (SO(2, D \u2212 1)) tangentspace Lorentz algebra of (A)dSD Einstein gravity. Thus, while the latter can be realized\nvia quadratic expressions in oscillators, the Vasiliev formulation rests on the use of\narbitrary polynomials, that essentially define what are commonly called \"higher-spin\nalgebras\".\nThere are actually two distinct versions of the Vasiliev equations. The original\none [18] applies to the four-dimensional case, rests on the properties of Grassman-even\noscillators \u03be\u03b1 and \u03be\u03b1\u0307 that are spinors of the tangent-space Lorentz group, and if truncated\nresults in free equations that are precisely in the constrained Fronsdal form, although\nthey are partly presented in spinor notation. On the other hand, a more recent version\n[19] rests on a different set of Grassman-even oscillators, YAi , that are simultaneously\nLorentz vectors and doublets of an internal Sp(2, R). It is closer in spirit to an offshell form and, interestingly, can accommodate the extended symmetry reviewed in this\npaper. The internal Sp(2, R) symmetry brings about some subtleties, requires suitable\nprojections, and allows two distinct options. The first, usually called \"weak projection\",\npursued by Vasiliev in [19] and reviewed in detail in [20], treats in a similar fashion the\none-form A and the zero-form \u03a6, and at the free level reduces again to the Fronsdal\nformulation. The second option, usually called \"strong projection\" [23], restricts only\nthe zero form \u03a6 while letting the gauge fields adjust correspondingly.\nOnce trace constraints are not enforced on the gauge fields, it is natural to expect\nthat the compensators \u03b1 should play a role, but this happens in a rather amusing and\nsurprising fashion. In the following we shall try to give a flavor of this result, following\n[23]. We should stress, however, that the prospects for the \"strong\" projection at the\ninteracting level are not fully clear at the moment, since it apparently brings about Weylordering divergences in non-linear terms, but on the other hand the off-shell origin of\nthe Vasiliev equations, where the unconstrained formulation would be expected to play\na key role, is also unclear. The recent work in [23] contains a preliminary analysis of the\nproblem. Although with the \"strong\" projection divergences would naively manifest\nthemselves in non-linear interactions, one can not exclude at the present time that\ndivergent field redefinitions or other subtleties may eventually suffice to remove them\u2217 .\nA proper discussion of the Vasiliev equations and of all these issues, however, is beyond\nthe scope of this review, and therefore we shall content ourselves with providing some\nhints.\nThe key fact is that, in building master fields with the vector oscillators YAi that\n\u2217 A.S. is grateful to C. Iazeolla and P. Sundell for extensive discussions on this point.\n\n\fHigher-Spin Geometry and String Theory\nsatisfy the commutation relations\n\u0002 i j\u0003\nYA , YB = i \u01ebij \u03b7AB\n\n15\n\n(A, B = 1, ..., D + 1) (i, j = 1, 2)\n\n(55)\n\none ends up in principle with Taylor coefficients, the ordinary fields, that aside from\nfilling the desired SO(2, D \u2212 1) or SO(1, D) representations generally transform under\nSp(2, R) as well.\nThe Sp(2, R) internal symmetry, on the other hand, reflects a redundancy, its origin\nbeing the need to dispose of dual sets of \"coordinates\" (the YA1 ) and \"momenta\" (the\nYA2 ) in order to write eq. (55). Hence the need for a restriction to fields that are Sp(2, R)\nsinglets, that can be effected by suitable constraints on A and \u03a6, but in order to arrive at\ndynamical equations one is to go further, removing also traces from the Weyl tensors in\n\u03a6, for a reason that we shall now try to explain. To this end, following [23], and abiding\nto a similar notation, let us begin by recalling that, if all interactions are neglected and\nthe cosmological constant is subsequently contracted away, the Vasiliev equations with\na \"strong\" projection reduce to the flat-space relations (s \u2265 2; k = 0, . . . , s \u2212 1) [32]\n(s\u22121,k)\n\n(s\u22121,k+1)\n\n\u2202[\u03bc W\u03bd],a(s\u22121),b(k) + W[\u03bc|,a(s\u22121),|\u03bd]b(k) = \u03b4k,s\u22121 C[\u03bc|a(s\u22121),|\u03bd]b(s\u22121) .\n\n(56)\n\nHere W (s\u22121,k) identifies a field transforming according to a traceful two-row Young\ntableau, with (s \u2212 1) boxes in the first row and k boxes in the second, in a convention\nwhere total row symmetrization is manifest, while for instance a(s \u2212 1) and b(k) denote\ntwo sets of (s \u2212 1) and k fully symmetrized tangent-space vector indices. Eqs. (56) are\ninvariant under the gauge transformations\n(s\u22121,k)\n\n(s\u22121,k)\n\n(s\u22121,k+1)\n\n\u03b4W\u03bc,a(s\u22121),b(k) = \u2212\u2202\u03bc \u03bea(s\u22121),b(k) + \u03bea(s\u22121),b(k)\u03bc\n(s\u22121,s\u22121)\n\n(s\u22121,s\u22121)\n\n\u03b4W\u03bc,a(s\u22121),b(s\u22121) = \u2212\u2202\u03bc \u03bea(s\u22121),b(s\u22121) ,\n(s\u22121,k)\n\n(k = 0, . . . , s \u2212 2)\n(57)\n\ninvolving the sequence of gauge parameters \u03bea(s\u22121),b(k) , for k = 0, . . . , s \u2212 1. It takes\nsome work to bring the compact-looking non-linear equations of [19],\ni\nb \u22c6\u03ba ,\nb\u03a6\nb = 0,\ndZ i \u2227 dZi \u03a6\nD\n(58)\nFb =\n2\nto this form, since the former involve additional non-commutative Z coordinates to be\ndisposed of via a perturbative expansion in powers of \u03a6. A nice discussion of how this\ncan be achieved for the simpler spinorial construction can be found in [33]. At any rate,\neq. (56) has a rather transparent meaning: it equates Riemann-like tensors to Weyl-like\nones. If the latter are trace-free, the end result is then enforcing, in an indirect way nicely\ncompatible with gauge invariance, via the trace of eq. (56), higher-spin generalizations\nof the Einstein equation \"Ricci = 0\".\nInsofar as the free limit is concerned, working with the \"strong\" projection of [23]\namounts to allowing in eqs. (56) one-forms W subject to no trace conditions while\nrestricting the corresponding Weyl tensors in C to be traceless. Let us consider eq. (56)\nfor the two cases of s = 2 and s = 3, in order to display explicitly what subtlety presents\nitself in the latter, leading eventually to the emergence of the compensator \u03b1.\nThe s = 2 case is the familiar example of linearized Einstein gravity in the\nframe formulation. Eqs. (56) becomes in this case a set of two conditions: the first,\n\n\fHigher-Spin Geometry and String Theory\n\n16\n\ncorresponding to k = 0, is the \"vielbein\" postulate, that relates the spin connection\n(1,1)\n(1,0)\nW\u03bc,a,b to the vielbein W\u03bc,a , while the trace of the second, corresponding to k = 1,\n(1,0)\n\ngives the Einstein equation. A partial gauge fixing of W\u03bc,a to a symmetric h\u03bc\u03bd recovers\nthe linearized Einstein equation in the metric form, that is also the s = 2 case of the\nFronsdal equation (2). Notice that the condition that this gauge choice be preserved\ncorrelates the two gauge parameters \u03bea and \u03bea,b , in the (1, 0) and (1, 1), in such a way\nthat\n1\n(\u2202b \u03bea \u2212 \u2202a \u03beb ) ,\n(59)\n\u03bea,b =\n2\nwhich turns the gauge transformation of the vielbein\n(1,0)\n\u03b4 W\u03bca\n= \u2212 \u2202\u03bc \u03bea + \u03bea,\u03bc\n\n(60)\n\ninto a proper transformation for h\u03bc\u03bd .\nThe novelty first shows up for spin s = 3, since in this case the iterative solution\nof the homogeneous constraints builds up at the second step a second-order operator\n(2,2)\nW\u03bc , whose trace in a pair of tangent-space indices has the right structure to be the\nfield equation. This is fully determined by its original gauge transformation into the\ngradient of a parameter \u03beab,cd transforming in the (2, 2) of the tangent-space group, built\nfrom the lowest gauge parameter \u03beab and two derivatives,\nc\n\u03beab,c\n\u223c 2 \u03beab \u2212 \u2202a \u2202 * \u03beb \u2212 \u2202b \u2202 * \u03bea + \u2202a \u2202b \u03be \u2032 ,\n\n(61)\n\nso that\n(2,2)\n\n\u03b7 cd Wab,cd = 2 \u03c6\u03bcab \u2212 \u2202a \u2202 * \u03c6\u03bcb \u2212 \u2202b \u2202 * \u03c6\u03bca + \u2202a \u2202b \u03c6\u2032 \u03bc ,\n\n(62)\n\n(2,0)\n\nafter gauge fixing W\u03bc,ab to a fully symmetric tensor \u03c6\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 .\nHowever, given the trace-free condition on the Weyl tensor C, the k = 2 condition\nimplies the additional constraint\n(2,2)\n\n\u2202[\u03bc W\u03bd],ab,c c = 0 ,\n\n(63)\n\nand therefore the term in eq. (62) is to be a pure gradient,\n2\u03c6ab\u03bc \u2212 \u2202a \u2202 * \u03c6b\u03bc \u2212 \u2202b \u2202 * \u03c6a\u03bc + \u2202a \u2202b \u03c6\u2032\u03bc = \u2202\u03bc \u03b2ab ,\n\n(64)\n\nbut a curl of this implies an additional constraint on \u03b2:\n\u2202[\u03bc (\u2202 * \u03c6a]b \u2212 \u2202a] \u03c6\u2032b ) = \u2202[\u03bc \u03b2b]a ,\n\n(65)\n\nThis constraint has an inhomogeneous solution,\n\u03b2ab = (\u2202 * \u03c6ab \u2212 \u2202a \u03c6\u2032b \u2212 \u2202b \u03c6\u2032a ) ,\n\n(66)\n\nbut also a homogenous solution, and this is where the compensator \u03b1 actually sits, as\nan \"exact\" form in the sense of Dubois-Violette and Henneaux [24].\nLet us pause to see explicitly the subtlety. They key point is that, if one tries to\nsolve the condition\n\u2202[\u03bc \u03b2a]b = 0 ,\n\n(67)\n\n\fHigher-Spin Geometry and String Theory\n\n17\n\nthe symmetry in (a, b) does not allow a single gradient. This is simple to see since,\nletting\n\u03b2ab = \u2202a \u03b1b + \u2202b \u03b1a ,\n\n(68)\n\neq. (67) implies indeed the additional constraint\n\u2202b \u2202[\u03bc \u03b1a] = 0 ,\n\n(69)\n\nwhose solution is\n\u03b1a = \u2202a \u03b1 .\n\n(70)\n\nThis identifies the compensator \u03b1, and putting these results together one finally recovers\nthe compensator equation (5) for s = 3. For higher spins one must similarly work\nbackwards from the highest constraint to the two-derivative operator, retaining the\nexact terms emerging at subsequent steps and subjecting them to due constraints. The\nend result is in the general the recovery of eq. (5), with spin-(s \u2212 3) compensators\nemerging from terms that are exact in the sense of [24]. This derivation resonates with\na result found by Bekaert and Boulanger [30] in their analysis of the link between\nthe compensator \u03b1 and the hierarchy of Freedman-deWit connections of [14], but\nit is actually different since, despite some unfortunate nomenclature in [23], in the\nVasiliev construction one is working with generalized spin connections, rather than with\ngeneralized Christoffel symbols.\nAcknowledgements\nWe are grateful to J.
