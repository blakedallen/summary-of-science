This goal is extremely challenging: one should be able to\nperform, on a system with a well-defined quantum state space (the computational space),\nprecise quantum-state preparation, coherent quantum manipulations (gating) of arbitrary\nlength, and state detection as well. It is well known that the major obstacle to implement\nthis ideal scheme is decoherence: the spoiling of the unitary character of quantum evolution\ndue to the uncontrollable coupling with environmental, i.e., non-computational, degrees of\nfreedom. Mostly due to the need of low decoherence rates, the first proposals for experimental realizations of quantum information processing devices originated from specialties in\natomic physics [2], in quantum optics [3], and in nuclear and electron magnetic-resonance\nspectroscopy [4]. On the other hand, practically relevant quantum computations require\na large number of quantum-hardware units (qubits), that are known to be hardly achievable in terms of such systems. In contrast, in spite of the serious difficulties related to\nthe \"fast\" decoherence times, a solid-state implementation of QIC seems to be the only\nway to benefit synergistically from the recent progress in ultrafast optoelectronics [5] as\nwell as in meso/nanostructure fabrication and characterization [6]. Among the proposed\nsolid-state implementations one should mention those in superconducting device physics [7]\nand in meso- and nanoscopic physics [8]. In particular, the first semiconductor-based proposal, by Loss and DiVincenzo, relies on spin dynamics in quantum dots; it exploits the low\ndecoherence of spin degrees of freedom in comparison to the one of charge excitations.\nAs originally envisioned in [9], gating of charge excitations could be performed by exploiting present ultrafast laser technology [5], that allows to generate and manipulate electronhole quantum states on a sub-picosecond time-scale: coherent-carrier-control [10]. In this\nrespect, decoherence times on nano/microsecond scales can be regarded as \"long\" ones.\nBased on this idea a few implementations have been recently put forward [11]; However,\nwhile in these proposals single-qubit operations are implemented by means of ultrafast optical spectroscopy, the control of two-qubit operations still involves the application of external\n2\n\n\ffields and/or microcavity-mode couplings, whose switching times are much longer than decoherence times in semiconductor quantum dots (QDs). It clearly follows that such proposals\nare currently out of reach in terms of state-of-the-art optoelectronics technology.\nAs already pointed out in [9], in order to take full advantage from modern ultrafast laser\nspectroscopy one should be able to design fully optical gating schemes able to perform singleand two-qubit operations on a sub-picosecond time-scale. Following this spirit, in this Letter\nwe propose the first all-optical implementation with semiconductor macromolecules. Our\nanalysis is based on a realistic, fully three-dimensional, description of multi-QD structures,\nwhose many-body electron-hole Hamiltonian can be schematically written as [12]:\nH = H\u25e6 + H\u2032 = (Hc + Hcc ) + (Hcl + Henv ) ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere Hc describes the non-interacting electron-hole system within the nanostructure confinement potential, Hcc is the sum of the three (electron-electron, hole-hole, and electronhole) Coulomb-interaction terms, Hcl describes the coupling of the carrier system with a\nclassical light field [13], while Henv describes the interaction of the carrier system with\nenvironmental degrees of freedom, like phonon and plasmon modes of the host material.\nThe latter is responsible for decoherence processes and it will be accounted for within a\ndensity-matrix formalism (see below).\nFor any given number of electron-hole pairs N, a direct diagonalization of H\u25e6 will provide\nthe many-body states of the interacting electron-hole system; they, in turn, allow to evaluate\nmany-exciton optical spectra, i.e., the absorption probability corresponding to the generic\nN \u2192 N \u2032 transition.\nThe above theoretical scheme has been applied to realistic state-of-the-art QD arrays.\nIn particular, as quantum hardware, we consider a GaAs-based structure with in-plane\nparabolic confinement potential [14]; Moreover, as discussed below (see Fig. 2), in order\nto induce a significant exciton-exciton dipole coupling, an in-plane static electric field F is\napplied. The square-like carrier confinement along the growth (z) direction for electrons\nand holes is schematically depicted in Fig. 1 for the array unit cell a + b. We stress that\n3\n\n\fthe geometrical and material parameters of the proposed prototypical structure in Fig. 1 are\nfully compatible with current QD growth and characterization technology [6,10].\nLet us discuss first the optical response of the semiconductor macromolecule (a + b) in\nFig. 1. The excitonic (0 \u2192 1) optical spectrum in the presence of an in-plane electric field\nF = 15 kV/cm is shown in Fig. 2(A), where the two lowest optical transitions correspond\nto the formation of direct ground-state excitons in dot a and b, respectively (see Fig. 1). In\ncontrast, the high-energy peaks correspond to optical transitions involving excited states of\nthe in-plane parabolic potential. Due to the strong in-plane carrier confinement, the lowenergy excitonic states are expected to closely resemble the corresponding single-particle\nones, thus involving the parabolic-potential ground state only. This is confirmed by the\nexcitonic spectrum (solid curve) in Fig. 2(B), which has been obtained limiting our singleparticle basis set to the parabolic-potential ground state. As we can see, apart from a small\nrigid shift, the relative position of the lowest transitions is the same. This suggests to use\nas a basis of our computational space the set formed by the lowest excitonic transition in\neach QD.\nLet us now come to the biexcitonic spectrum [dashed line in Fig. 2(B)]; it describes the\ngeneration of a second electron-hole pair in the presence of a previously created exciton (1 \u2192\n2 optical transitions). The crucial feature in Fig. 2(B) is the magnitude of the \"biexcitonic\nshift\" [6], i.e., the energy difference between the excitonic and the biexcitonic transition (see\nsolid and dashed curves). For the QD structure under investigation we get energy splittings\nup to 5 meV [see inset in Fig. 2(B)], which is by far larger than typical biexcitonic splittings\nin single QDs [6]. This is due to the in-plane static field F , which induces a charge separation\nbetween electrons and holes. This, in turn, gives rise to significant dipole-dipole coupling\nbetween adjacent excitonic states. The microscopic origin of such exciton-exciton coupling\nis the same of the Forster process exploited by Quiroga and Johnson [15] for the generation\nof entangled states in coupled QDs.\nThe physical origin of the biexcitonic shift \u2206E is qualitatively described in Fig. 2(C),\nwhere we show the electron and hole charge distribution corresponding to the biexcitonic\n4\n\n\fground state.\nThe central idea in our QIC proposal is to exploit such few-exciton effect to design conditional operations. To this end let us introduce the excitonic occupation number operators\nn\u0302l , where l denotes the generic QD in our array. The two states with eigenvalues nl = 0 and\nnl = 1 correspond, respectively, to the absence (no conduction-band electrons) and to the\npresence of a ground-state exciton (a Coulomb-correlated electron-hole pair) in dot l; they\nconstitute our single-qubit basis: |0il and |1il . The whole computational state-space H is\nthen spanned by the basis |ni = \u2297l |nl i, (nl = 0, 1).\nThe full many-body Hamiltonian H\u25e6 in (1) restricted to the above computational space\nH reduces to\nH\u0303\u25e6 =\n\nX\nl\n\nEl n\u0302l +\n\n1X\n\u2206Ell\u2032 n\u0302l n\u0302l\u2032 .\n2 ll\u2032\n\n(2)\n\nHere, El denotes the energy of the ground-state exciton in dot l while \u2206Ell\u2032 is the biexcitonic\nshift due to the Coulomb interaction between dots l and l\u2032 , previously introduced (see Fig. 2).\nThe effective Hamiltonian in (2) has exactly the same structure of the one proposed by Lloyd\nin his pioneering paper on quantum cellular automata [16], and it is the Model Hamiltonian\ncurrently used in most of the NMR quantum-computing schemes [17]. This fact is extremely\nimportant since it tells us that: (i) the present semiconductor-based implementation contains\nall relevant ingredients for the realization of basic QIC processing; (ii) it allows to establish a\none-to-one correspondence between our semiconductor-based scheme and much more mature\nimplementations, like NMR [17].\nAccording to (2), the single-exciton energy El is renormalized by the biexcitonic shift\n\u2206Ell\u2032 , induced by the presence of a second exciton in dot l\u2032 (\u1ebcl = El +\n\nP\n\nl\u2032 6=l\n\n\u2206Ell\u2032 nl\u2032 ). In\n\norder to better illustrate this idea, let us focus again on the two-QD structure, i.e. two-qubit\nsystem, of Fig. 1 and fix our attention on one of the two dots, say dot b. The effective energy\ngap between |0ib and |1ib depends now on the occupation of dot a. This elementary remark\nsuggests to design properly tailored laser-pulse sequences to implement controlled-not logic\ngates among the two QDs as well as single-qubit rotations. Indeed, by sending an ultrafast\n5\n\n\flaser \u03c0-pulse with central energy h\u0304\u03c9b [na ] = Eb + \u2206Eba na , the transition |nb ib \u2192 |1 \u2212 nb ib\n(\u03c0-rotation) of the target qubit (dot b) is obtained if and only if the control qubit (dot a)\nis in the state |nia . Notice that the above scheme corresponds to the so-called selective\npopulation transfer in NMR [17]; alternative procedures used in that field can be adapted\nto the present proposal as well.\nMoreover, by denoting with Ubna the generic unitary transformation induced by the laser\n\u03c0-pulse of central frequency \u03c9b [na ], it is easy to check that the two-color pulse sequence\nUb0 Ub1 achieves the unconditional \u03c0-rotation of qubit b.\nIn order to test the viability of the proposed quantum-computation strategy, we have\nperformed a few simulated experiments of basic quantum information processing. Our timedependent simulations are based on the realistic state-of-the-art QD structure of Fig. 1:\nEa = 1.70 eV, Eb = 1.71 eV, \u2206E = 4, 5 meV, which correspond to F = 30 kV/cm [see inset in\nFig. 2(B)]. They are based on a numerical solution of the Liouville-von Neumann equation\ndescribing the exact quantum-mechanical evolution of the many-exciton system (2) within\nour computational subspace H in the presence of environment-induced decoherence processes\n[see term Henv in Eq. (1)] [18]. Figure 3 shows a simulated sequence of single- plus two-qubit\noperations driven by a two-color laser-pulse sequence.\nInitially the system is in the state |0, 0i \u2261 |0ia \u2297 |0ib . The first laser pulse (at t = 0.2 ps)\n\u221a\nis tailored in such a way to induce a \u03c02 rotation of the qubit a: |0, 0i \u2192 (|0, 0i+|1, 0i)/ 2. At\ntime t = 0.8 ps a second pulse induces a conditional \u03c0-rotation of the qubit b: |0, 0i+|1, 0i \u2192\n|0, 0i+|1, 1i. This last operation plays a central role in any quantum information processing,\nsince it transforms a factorized state ((|0i + |1i) \u2297 |0i) into an entangled state. The scenario\ndescribed so far is confirmed by the time evolution of the exciton occupation numbers na\nand nb reported in (A) as well as of the diagonal elements of the density matrix (in our\nfour-dimensional computational basis) reported in (B). As we can see, during the pulse\nenergy-nonconserving (or off-resonant) transitions [12] take place; however, at the end of\nthe pulse such effects vanish and the desired quantum state is reached.\nThe experiment simulated above clearly shows that the energy scale of the biexcitonic\n6\n\n\fsplitting in our quantum-dot molecule [see Fig. 2] is compatible with the sub-picosecond\noperation time-scale of Fig. 3.\nAt this point a few comments are in order. First we stress a very important feature\nof the proposed semiconductor-based implementation: as for NMR quantum computing,\ntwo-body interactions are always switched on (this should be compared to the schemes in\nwhich two-qubit gates are realized by turning on and off the coupling between subsystems,\ne.g., by means of slowly-varying fields and cavity-mode couplings); conditional as well as\nunconditional dynamics is realized by means of sequences of ultrafast single-qubit operations\nwhose length does not scale as a function of the total number of QDs in the array [19].\nLet us now come to the state measurement. In view of the few-exciton character of the\nproposed quantum hardware, the conventional measurement of the carrier subsystem by\nspectrally-resolved luminescence needs to be replaced by more sensitive detection schemes.\nTo this end, a viable strategy could be to apply to our semiconductor-based structure the\nwell-known recycling techniques commonly used in quantum-optics experiments [20]. Generally speaking, the idea is to properly combine quantum- and dielectric-confinement effects\nin order to obtain well-defined energy levels, on which to design energy-selective photonamplification schemes.\nThe nanoscale range of the inter-dot coupling we employed for enabling conditional dynamics does not allow for space-selective optical addressing of individual qubits. For this\nreason, at least for our basic QD molecule (a+ b), we resorted to an energy selective addressing scheme. However, extending such strategy to the whole QD array would imply different\nvalues of the excitonic transition in each QD, i.e., El 6= El\u2032 . This, besides obvious technological difficulties, would constitute a conceptual limitation of scalability towards massive\nQuantum Computations. The problem can be avoided following a completely different strategy originally proposed by Lloyd [16] and recently improved in [21]: by properly designed\nsequences of multicolor global pulses within a cellular-automaton scheme, local addressing\nis replaced by information-encoding transfer along our QD array.\nFinally, a present limitation of the proposed quantum hardware are the non-uniform\n7\n\n\fstructural and geometrical properties of the QDs in the array, which may give rise to energy\nbroadenings larger than the biexcitonic shift. However, recent progress in QD fabrication\n-including the realization of QD structures in microcavities- will allow, we believe, to\novercome this purely technological (non conceptual) limitation.\nIn summary, the first all optical implementation of QIC with a semiconductor-based quantum hardware has been proposed. Our analysis has shown that energy-selected optical transitions in realistic state-of-the-art QD structures are good candidates for quantum-information\nencoding and manipulation. The sub-picosecond time-scale of ultrafast laser spectroscopy\nallows for a relatively large number of elementary operations within the exciton decoherence\ntime.\nWe are grateful to David DiVincenzo, Neil Johnson, Seth Lloyd, and Mario Rasetti for\nstimulating and fruitful discussions.\nThis work has been supported in part by the European Commission through the Research\nProject SQID within the Future and Emerging Technologies (FET) programme.\n\n8\n\n\fREFERENCES\n[1] See, e.g., D.P.

(B) Excitonic (solid\ncurve) and biexcitonic spectrum (dashed curve) obtained including the in-plane ground state only.\nDue to the well-defined polarization of our laser source, the two structures in the biexcitonic\nspectrum correspond to the formation of an exciton in dot a given an exciton in dot b and vice\nversa. (C) Three-dimensional view of the spatial charge distributions of the two electrons (ea and\neb ) and holes (ha and hb ) corresponding to the biexcitonic ground state in (B). As we can see, the\ncharge separation induced by the static field increases significantly the average distance between\nelectrons and holes, thus decreasing their attractive interaction. On the other hand, the repulsive\nterms are basically field independent. This is the origin of the positive energy difference \u2206E in (B).\nFIG. 3.
