The TG regime of\nstrongly interacting bosons has been reached in a one-dimensional optical-lattice trap [20].\nThe one-dimensional TG gas of bosons moving freely was also recently realized [21] for 87 Rb\natoms by trapping them with a combination of two light traps. By changing the trap intensities it was possible to vary the ratio of the effective interaction to kinetic energy, achieving\nthe TG regime, with this ratio reaching 5.5. The physical properties of low-dimensional Bose\ngases have been discussed in reviews [22,23]. However the important problem of the FermiBose mapping in one-dimensional gases has not received the proper attention. It is the aim\nof the present short survey to compensate this deficiency by concentrating primarily on the\nFermi-Bose mapping, first advanced over 40 years ago [24,25] for one-dimensional Bose gases.\nParticular emphasis will be placed on demonstrating the generality of this mapping, whose\napplicability is essentially wider than solely to the ground states of impenetrable bosons,\nas it is often considered in literature, when the mapping is reduced to an absolute-value\nrelation. We shall stress that the mapping in its general form [24,25] is valid for the total\nspectrum of excited states, for the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation, and not only for\nimpenetrable bosons, but also for the Lieb-Liniger gas with contact interactions of arbitrary\nstrength.\n\n2\n\nTG gas\n\nThe mapping theorem was formulated for a quantum one-dimensional system of N bosons\nat zero temperature [24,25]. First, only the stationary states were considered. But, since\nthe mapping procedure does not involve time, it was later stressed that the same mapping\nalso applies for the time dependent many-body Schr\u00f6dinger equation, which was employed\nfor treating temporal interference properties of the one-dimensional hard-core Bose gas [26\u2013\n31]. Therefore from the very beginning we may consider a time-dependent Hamiltonian\n\u0124 \u2261 \u0124(x1 , . . . , xN , t) where xi \u2208 [0, L], with i = 1, 2, . . . , N. The Hamiltonian is written as\na general expression\nN\n1 X\n\u0124 = K\u0302 + U +\n\u03a6ij ,\n(1)\n2 i6=j\nin which K\u0302 is a kinetic-energy operator, having for nonrelativistic atoms of mass m the form\nN\n\u22022\nh\u03042 X\n;\nK\u0302 \u2261 \u2212\n2m i=1 \u2202x2i\n\n(2)\n\nthe term U \u2261 U(x1 , . . . , xN , t) describes any external potentials, such as confining potentials,\ngenerally allowing for the time dependence; and \u03a6ij \u2261 \u03a6(xi \u2212xj ) is a two-particle interaction\npotential. For bosonic atoms, the wave function\n\u03c8B \u2261 \u03c8B (x1 , . . . , xN , t)\n2\n\n(3)\n\n\fis symmetric with respect to the permutations of any xi and xj . The wave function (3) is a\nsolution to the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation\nih\u0304\n\n\u2202\n\u03c8 = \u0124\u03c8 .\n\u2202t\n\n(4)\n\nIn the stationary case, this reduces to the eigenvalue problem\n\u0124\u03c8 = E\u03c8 .\n\n(5)\n\nThe two-particle interaction is assumed to contain a hard core of diameter a, which can be\nconveniently treated as a constraint on allowed wave functions\n\u03c8(x1 , . . . , xN , t) = 0\n\n(|xi \u2212 xj | \u2264 a)\n\n(6)\n\nfor 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 N, rather than as an infinite contribution to the interaction potential.\nUnder constraint (6), the infinite hard-core potentials can be omitted from the Schr\u00f6dinger\nequation, at the same time including all other possible finite interactions into the term U.\nThen Hamiltonian (1) can be contracted to the form\n\u0124 = K\u0302 + U ,\n\n(7)\n\nwhile imposing constraint (6) on the solution of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation. The latter in a\nparticular case of point-like impenetrable particles simplifies to\n\u03c8(x1 , . . . , xN , t) = 0\n\n(xi = xj ) ,\n\n(8)\n\nwhere 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 N.\nThe problem of a one-dimensional hard-core gas was raised by Tonks [32], who considered\nthe statistical mechanics of the classical high-temperature regime, while Girardeau [24,25]\ngave the solution for the quantum problem. That is why the one-dimensional system of\nimpenetrable bosons is now commonly called the Tonks-Girardeau gas.\nThe mapping theorem [24,25] can be formulated as follows. Let a wave function \u03c8F \u2261\n\u03c8F (x1 , . . . , xN , t) be a solution to the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation (4), with Hamiltonian (7), possessing the fermionic antisymmetric property with respect to all permutations\nof any xi and xj , for i 6= j, and satisfying constraint (6). Introduce a unit antisymmetric\nfunction\nA(x1 , . . . , xN ) \u2261\n\nN\nY\n\ni>j\n\nsgn(xi \u2212 xj ) ,\n\n(9)\n\nin which\nx\nsgn(x) \u2261\n=\n|x|\n\n(\n\n1, x > 0 ,\n\u22121, x < 0 .\n\nThen the bosonic solution to Eq. (4) is given by the mapping\n\u03c8B (x1 , . . . , xN , t) = A(x1 , . . . , xN ) \u03c8F (x1 , . . . , xN , t) .\n3\n\n(10)\n\n\fBy this construction, function (10) satisfies the same hard-core constraint (6) as \u03c8F . In\nthe case of point particles, condition (8) holds automatically owing to the Pauli principle\nfor \u03c8F . Function (10) is totally symmetric under permutations of any xi and xj . It satisfies\nthe initial and boundary conditions directly following from those for \u03c8F . In the case of a\nstationary uniform system with periodic boundary conditions, the latter are preserved under\nmapping (10) if N is odd, but if N is even, periodic (antiperiodic) boundary conditions on\n\u03c8B require antiperiodic (periodic) boundary conditions on \u03c8F . However for large N \u226b 1, the\ncharacter of such boundary conditions becomes not important. The fermionic wave function\n\u03c8F can be considered as corresponding to a fictitious system of spinless fermions, or better\nto say, to a system of real fermions with frozen spins aligned in the same direction.\nThe Fermi-Bose mapping (10) is valid for the time-dependent wave functions, since the\nantisymmetric function (9) does not include time. The system Hamiltonian may contain any\nexternal fields and any other finite particle interactions in addition to the hard-core ones.\nFor the stationary Schr\u00f6dinger equation (5), the mapping applies for the whole spectrum of\nall eigenstates.\n\n3\n\nGround state\n\nIt is solely for the stationary ground state that mapping (10) reduces to a simplified form\n\u03c80B (x1 , . . . , xN ) = |\u03c80F (x1 , . . . , xN )| .\n\n(11)\n\nAs is evident, the absolute-value mapping (11) cannot apply to excited states or to the timedependent case, when the wave functions are, generally, complex, whereas mapping (11)\nyields only real functions. In addition, for excited states (11) introduces unphysical cusps in\n\u03c80B arising from the requirement of orthogonality of different fermionic eigenstates \u03c80F , and\npositivity of (11) violates the requirement of orthogonality of different bosonic eigenstates\n\u03c80B . These defects are not present in the original mapping (10).\nUnder the assumption that the only two-particle interaction is a zero-range hard-core\nrepulsion, represented by the hard-core constraint (8), and there are no external potentials,\nthe ground state can be found explicitly [24]. Since the fermionic wave functions vanish automatically whenever any xi = xj for i 6= j, the constraint has no effect, and the corresponding\nfermionic ground state is that of the ideal gas of fermions, given by a Slater determinant of\nthe lowest N single-particle plane-wave orbitals. The exact bosonic ground state was found\n[24] to be a product\n\u03c80B (x1 , . . . , xN )\n\n2N (N \u22121)\n=\nN!LN\n\"\n\n#1/2\n\nN\nY\n\nsin\n\ni>j\n\nk0 (xi \u2212 xj )\n,\nN\n\n(12)\n\nin which k0 plays the role of the Fermi wave vector,\nN\n.\n(13)\nL\nThe ground-state energy can also be determined exactly [24,33,34].

Using the\nknown asymptotics of the Toeplitz determinants, it was possible to prove the absence of\nBose-Einstein condensate by showing the power-law decay of the density matrix at large\ndistance, that is, by demonstrating the absence of long-range order. The precise form of\nthis power-law decay was found later by Lenard [41,42], who obtained the long-distance\nbehaviour as\n\u03c1\n\u03c11 (x, 0) \u2243 C \u221a\n(|x| \u2192 \u221e) ,\n(31)\nk0 x\nZ\n\nn(k)\n\nwhere k0 \u2261 \u03c0\u03c1. The coefficient C = 0.92418 was found by Vaidya and Tracy [43,44]. Higherorder terms in the asymptotic behaviour of \u03c11 (x, 0) were derived by Jimbo et al. [45]. The\nmost accurate results are due to the recent work by Gangardt [46], who obtained\nC\u03c1\n\u03c11 (x, 0) \u2243 \u221a\nk0 x\n\n\"\n\n1\u2212\n\ncos(2k0 x)\n3 sin(2k0 x)\n1\n\u2212\n\u2212\n+\n2\n2\n32(k0x)\n8(k0 x)\n16(k0x)3\n\n33\n93 cos(2k0 x)\n+\n+\n4\n2048(k0x)\n256(k0x)4\n\n#\n\n.\n\n(32)\n\nHe also found the finite-size corrections for atoms in the harmonic trapping potential and\nfor the case of circular geometry [46].\nThe investigation of the properties of the first-order density matrix (26) revealed that the\nnumber of particles in the Bose condensate, which is associated\nwith the largest eigenvalue\n\u221a\nof eigenproblem (28), is of the order of N0 \u2261 supj nj \u223c N. This implies that there is no\nreal Bose-Einstein condensate in the uniform Tonks-Girardeau gas.\nThe case of trapped atoms does not allow for a simple analytical expression of the largest\neigenvalue nj . The multidimensional integral (26) was evaluated numerically by Monte Carlos integration [35,36]. Highly accurate results for large values of N were found by Forrester\n\u221a\net al. [47]. These results show that again, as in the spatially uniform case, N0 \u223c N .\nThus, there is no true Bose-Einstein condensate in the trapped TG gas, because of which\nthe Gross-Pitaevskii equation, presuming the existence of a well-defined order parameter associated with genuine Bose-Einstein condensate, has limited utility, especially, for temporal\nprocesses [26,31,48]. This is contrary to the case of the trapped ideal gas, where Bose-Einstein\ncondensation can develop, though as a gradual crossover but not as a sharp phase transition\n7\n\n\f[49]. Nevertheless, since for N \u226b 1 the momentum distribution of the Tonks-Girardeau gas\nexhibits a peak n(k) \u223c k \u22121/2 in the neighbourhood of zero momentum, and a kind of order\ndoes exist, such a system displays some coherence effects, and the Gross-Pitaevskii equation\nhas a limited region of applicability [50].\nIn order to accurately classify the type of order arising in the TG gas, it is possible to\nresort to the notion of the order indices, introduced for density matrices [39] and generalized\nfor the case of arbitrary operators [51]. The order index of an operator \u00c2 is defined [51] as\nlog ||\u00c2||\n,\nlog |Tr\u00c2|\n\n\u03c9(\u00c2) \u2261\n\n(33)\n\nwhere || * || means a Hermitian norm. For an n-th order boson density matrix \u03c1\u0302n , one has\n||\u03c1\u0302n || \u223c ||\u03c1\u03021 ||n . Also, log |Tr\u03c1\u0302n | \u2243 n log N, when N \u226b 1. Therefore, applying definition (33)\nfor a reduced density matrix \u03c1\u0302n , we have\n\u03c9(\u03c1\u0302n ) =\n\nlog ||\u03c1\u03021 ||\n.\nlog N\n\n(34)\n\nTaking into account that\n||\u03c1\u03021 || = max nj = N0 ,\nj\n\nEq. (34) can be rewritten as\n\u03c9(\u03c1\u0302n ) =\n\nlog N0\n.\nlog N\n\nFor the Tonks-Girardeau gas, both uniform as well as trapped, N0 \u223c\n\n\u221a\n\nN . Thence\n\n1\n.\n(35)\n2\nIn the case of a genuine Bose-Einstein condensate with long-range order, one would have\n\u03c9(\u03c1\u0302n ) = 1. The order index (35) characterizes a system with mid-range order [39,51]. The\noccurrence of mid-range order means that, though there is no true Bose-Einstein condensate,\nsome partial coherence does exist in the system.\n\u03c9(\u03c1\u0302n ) =\n\n6\n\nLieb-Liniger gas\n\nUp to now, the Fermi-Bose mapping (10) has been applied to the TG gas, that is, the onedimensional gas of impenetrable bosons. However, as it turned out, the applicability of this\nmapping is much wider, being valid for a large class of one-dimensional systems called the\nLieb-Liniger gas, which is characterized by the contact two-particle interaction\n\u03a6(x) = \u03a60 \u03b4(x) .\n\n(36)\n\nThe one-dimensional system with this interaction was studied by Lieb and Liniger [52,53].\nThe delta potential (36) leaves the wave function continuous but yields a jump in the derivative according to the condition\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2212\n\u2202xi\n\u2202xj\n\n!\n\n\u03c8B\n\nxi =xj +0\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\n=\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2202xi\n\u2202xj\n8\n\n!\n\n\u03c8B\n\nxi =xj \u22120\n\n=\n\nm\u03a60\n\u03c8B\nh\u03042\n\nxi =xj \u00b10\n\n.\n\n(37)\n\n\fThe dimensionless ground-state energy of this gas,\ne(g) \u2261\n\n2mE0\n,\nh\u03042 \u03c12 N\n\n(38)\n\nexpressed as a function of the dimensionless coupling parameter\ng\u2261\n\nm\u03a60\n,\n\u03c1h\u03042\n\n(39)\n\nis given [52] by the equation\ne(g) =\n\n\u0012 \u00133 Z\n\ng\n\u03bb\n\n1\n\n\u22121\n\nf (x)x2 dx ,\n\n(40)\n\nin which the function f (x) satisfies the integral equation\n2\u03c0f (x) = 1 + 2\u03bb\n\nZ\n\n1\n\n\u22121\n\nf (y) dy\n,\n\u03bb2 + (x \u2212 y)2\n\n(41)\n\nand the constant \u03bb is defined by the normalization condition\ng\n\u03bb\n\nZ\n\n1\n\n\u22121\n\nf (x) dx = 1 .\n\n(42)\n\nNumerical solution for e(g) was given in Refs.

The scattering length a1D diverges at\n(ap /l\u22a5 )3 \u223c\n= \u22121.134. The fermionic TG gas regime occurs in the neighbourhood of this resonance. The one-dimensional scattering lengths are invariant under the Fermi-Bose mapping\n(10), as a result of which the scattering length a1D is the same for bosons and fermions.\nThe contact condition (47) is generated by the one-dimensional pseudopotential operator\n[62]\n!\n\u2202\u03c8F\n1 \u2202\u03c8F\nF\nF \u2032\n\u2212\n,\n(49)\n\u03a6 (x) = \u03a60 \u03b4 (x)\n2 \u2202x x+0\n\u2202x x\u22120\nin which \u03b4 \u2032 (x) is the derivative of the Dirac delta-function and the effective coupling strength\nis\na1D\n.\n\u03a6F0 = 2h\u03042\nm\nThis should be compared with the bosonic interaction strength\n\u03a6B\n0 = \u2212\n\n2h\u03042\n.\nma1D\n\nThe spin-aligned Fermi gas maps to the Lieb-Liniger Bose gas, with the fermionic and bosonic\ninteraction strengths inversely related [60,61] as\nF\n\u03a6B\n0 \u03a60 = \u2212\n\n4h\u03044\n.\nm2\n\n(50)\n\nFrom here, it is clear that a strongly interacting Fermi gas can be mapped to a weakly\ninteracting Bose gas.

The properties of\nsuch gases are drastically different from those of their three-dimensional counterparts. For\ncomparison, we may recall the ground-state energy of the three-dimensional dilute Bose gas\nwith a hard-sphere interaction. The dimensionless ground-state energy is\n\u0010\n\u0011\n2mE0\n1/2\n\u2032\n1/3\n1\n+\nb\n\u03b1\n+\nb\n\u03b1\n+\nb\n\u03b1\nln\n\u03b1\n,\n\u2248\n4\u03c0\u03b1\n1\n2\n2\nh\u03042 \u03c12/3 N\n\nwhere \u03b1 \u2261 \u03c1a3 \u226a 1, with a being the sphere diameter, and where the coefficients b1 and b\u20322\nare\n\u0012\n\u221a \u0013\n128\n4\u03c0\n\u2032\nb1 = \u221a = 4.814418 ,\nb2 = 8\n\u2212 3 = 19.653915 .\n15 \u03c0\n3\nThe coefficient b1 was found in Refs. [65\u201369] and b\u20322 in Refs. [70,71]. The coefficient b2\nhas not been determined exactly. According to Wu [70], one has b2 = b\u20322 ln(12\u03c0) = 71.337.\nHugenholtz and Pines [72] give b2 \u2248 74.617. Another quantity that could be compared with\nits one-dimensional counterpart is the pair correlation function of the three-dimensional\ndilute gas of hard-sphere bosons, which is found [67] to be\nC\ng(r) \u2243 1 \u2212 1/6\n\u03b1\nwhere r \u226b a0 , \u03b1 \u226a 1 and\n\nC=\n\n1\n\u221a ,\n(2\u03c0)2 \u03c0\n\n\u0012\n\na0\nr\n\n\u00134\n\n,\n\n\u03c1a30 \u2261 1 ,\n\na0 being the mean interparticle distance. The behaviour of both E0 and g(r) for the threedimensional gas is essentially different from their one-dimensional analogs. Being principally\ndifferent, the three-dimensional gas does not allow for a direct mapping between bosons and\nfermions, as in the one-dimensional case, which makes its treatment much more involved.\nWhile in the one-dimensional case, the Fermi-Bose mapping (10) gives a great advantage in\nthe simplification of the mathematical description.\nNowadays one-dimensional Bose gases are not just artificial models, but vise versa are\nreal physical objects realized in a number of experiments [5\u201321] with quasi-one-dimensional\ntraps and waveguides. Quasi-one-dimensional dilute Bose gases can be treated as purely\none-dimensional gases, with their effective interaction of the contact type (36), where the\ninteraction strength\n\"\n#\u22121\n|\u03b6(1/2)|as\n2h\u03042 as\n\u221a\n1\u2212\n\u03a60 =\n2\nml\u22a5\n2l\u22a5\nis expressed\nthrough the three-dimensional scattering length as and the oscillator length\nq\nl\u22a5 \u2261 h\u0304/m\u03c9\u22a5 of the confining radial potential [73,74]. Here \u03b6(1/2) = \u22121.4603.\nAn additional dimension is provided by the Feshbach resonance techniques which make\nit possible: to vary the scattering length in a very wide range, transforming the interaction\nstrength from weak to strong coupling; to realize heteronuclear resonances between two\ndifferent atomic species [75,76]; and to perform a crossover between a degenerate fermionic\ngas and a gas of bosonic molecules (see Refs. [23,77\u201379]). In quasi-one-dimensional traps, the\n11\n\n\fFeshbach resonance techniques would allow for a continuous tuning of the system properties\nfrom a weakly interacting gas to the hard-core TG gas [80].\nThe remarkable generality of the Fermi-Bose mapping (10) provides us with a convenient\npractical tool for considering different regimes of one-dimensional or quasi-one-dimensional\ndilute Bose systems, from the TG gas of impenetrable bosons to the Lieb-Liniger gas with\ncontact interactions. Moreover, mapping (10) is applicable for describing nonequilibrium\nprocesses in such one-dimensional gases. A great variety of available experiments, to which\nthe general mapping (10) is applicable, makes the latter of fundamental importance.\n\n12\n\n\fReferences\n[1] P.W. Courteille, V.S.
