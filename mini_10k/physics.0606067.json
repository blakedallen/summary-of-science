Our technique for producing the vapor is based\non coating the inner walls of the fiber core with an organosilane and using light-induced atomic\ndesorption to release Rb atoms into the core. We develop a model to describe the dynamics of\nthe atomic density, and as an initial demonstration of the potential of this system for supporting\nultra-low-level nonlinear optical interactions, we perform electromagnetically-induced transparency\nwith control-field powers in the nanowatt regime, which represents more than a 1000-fold reduction\nfrom the power required for bulk, focused geometries.\nPACS numbers: 42.50.Gy,32.80.Qk,42.70.Qs\n\n\u2217\n\nElectronic address: a.gaeta@cornell.edu\n\n1\n\n\fRemarkable advances have been made in the past decade in generating and controlling\nquantum states of light using atomic vapors, including the realization of on-demand singlephoton sources [1], manipulation of photonic states [2], and storage and retrieval of the states\nwith high fidelity [3, 4]. Much of the motivation for these efforts has been to realize a practical\nquantum network [5]. In most cases, the underlying optical process for realizing these\nschemes has been the phenomenon of electromagnetically-induced transparency (EIT) [6] in\nwhich a coherent superposition of atomic states is created by a strong control field such that\nan optically thick atomic ensemble is rendered transparent to a weak, resonant probe field.\nThe concept of EIT has been applied and expanded to schemes that allow two extremely weak\nfields, which in principle can consist of single photon pulses, to strongly interact [7, 8, 9, 10].\nPractical implementation of these proposals in which a single photon can switch another\nphoton will lead to the realization of critical components (e.g., a quantum phase gate) for\nquantum information applications [11].\nThe two generic requirements to achieve EIT-based, ultralow-level optical interactions\nare: 1) a large optical depth \u03ba = nL\u03c3, where n is the density of the atomic sample of length\nL, and \u03c3 is the atomic absorption cross-section, and 2) confinement of the light beams to\nan area A comparable to the atomic scattering cross-section of 3\u03bb2 /2\u03c0 [8, 9, 10, 12]. For\nexample, the phase shift due to nonlinear interactions between few photon-pulses in the\nproposed scheme of Andr\u00e9 et al. [10] and the inverse of the critical power required to switch\na signal field in the four-level scheme of Harris and Yamamoto [8] are each proportional to\n\u03ba/A. In order to maximize the optical depth, a natural choice for the atomic ensemble is an\nalkali atom due to its relatively simple energy-level structure and its large \u03c3 as compared to,\nfor example, molecules with ro-vibrational transitions [13]. There is a limit on how much \u03ba\ncan be increased by increasing the density n since this will result in undesirable dephasing\neffects due to atomic collisions. Alternatively, increasing the length L of the atomic sample\ncan further enhance the optical depth. However, in a bulk focused geometry, this length L\nis limited to the Rayleigh length, which can only be increased by a corresponding increase\nin beam area A [5, 10], and thus no change in the quantity \u03ba/A.\nIn this Letter, we realize a new experimental geometry for alkali vapors that overcomes\nthe limitations of bulk focused geometries by using light-induced atomic desorption (LIAD)\nto produce controllable densities of Rb atoms within a suitably coated core of a photonic\nband-gap fiber (PBGF).

Part of Cell 1 is expanded to illustrate the region of the cell in front of the\nfiber tip. The beam reflected off a mirror at the back end of Cell 1 is used to calibrate the density\nin the cell.\n\n[see Fig. 1(a)] provides an unmatched ability to tightly confine light with a gas in a region\na few microns in diameter over meter-long distances, and thus provides an ideal system to\nperform nonlinear optics at extremely low light levels [10, 12]. Recent demonstrations of\nnonlinear optical processes in PBGFs using gases with relatively weak nonlinearities has led\nto the observation of low-threshold stimulated Raman scattering [15], high-power soliton\ngeneration [16], and coherent resonant interactions with molecules [13, 17]. By using a gas\nsuch as an alkali vapor with a strong nonlinear optical response, such a fiber system can\nform a the basis for creation, manipulation, storage and transmission of photonic states in\na fiber geometry. However up until now, the ability to inject alkali atoms into PBGFs has\neluded researchers due to the strong interaction of the vapor with silica walls of the fiber.\nThe primary challenge to creating a useful vapor of Rb atoms within a PBGF is that Rb\n\n3\n\n\fvapor attacks and adheres to silica glass fiber walls through both physisorption, in which the\natoms stick to the surface for a finite time, and through chemisorption, in which the atoms\nare lost to the wall [18]. These issues are particularly severe for a fiber with a core 6-\u03bcm\nin diameter [19], which is a factor of 108 smaller than the atomic mean free path at room\ntemperature. Furthermore, for the fraction of atoms undergoing physisorption, the spindecoherence is large [20], which makes this system unsuitable as a practical quantum device.\nHowever, treating a glass surface with paraffin or siloxane coatings [21] significantly alters\nthe Rb-surface interaction properties such that the wall-induced dephasing rate decreases by\nfour orders of magnitude with a significant reduction in chemisorption when compared with\nthat for uncoated silica glass walls [22]. In addition, atoms attached to such coated walls\ncan be released by sudden exposure to optical radiation through the non-thermal process\ntermed LIAD [23, 24, 25].\nWe applied these techniques to the fiber geometry by surface-modifying the core walls of\na PBGF {AIR-6-800, Crystal Fibre, with a core diameter of 6 \u03bcm [Fig.1(a)] and a bandgap\nextending from 750 to 810 nm, chosen to accommodate the D1 and D2 lines of Rb at\n795 nm and 780 nm, respectively [Fig.1(b)]} with a monolayer of C18 H35 moieties by selfassembly of octadecyldimethylmethoxysilane (ODMS) [26] via hydrolysis and condensation\nfrom solution. This monolayer deposition technique avoids the clogging of the fiber core\nthat would occur for vacuum deposition of paraffin. The coating solution was introduced\nfrom polyolefin syringes to the PBGF via swaged PEEK fixtures, , incubated in the core to\nfacilitate the monolayer deposition, and then flushed out. As seen in Fig.1(b), the bandgap of\nthe fiber is preserved following the coating process. Following the monolayer deposition, the\nends of the PBGF of length Lf ib = 25 cm are placed in separate vacuum cells which are each\nconnected to an ultra-high vacuum system [Fig. 1(c)]. One of the cells [left cell, in Fig. 1(c)]\nis subsequently exposed to natural Rb vapor, at a pressure of 10\u22126 Torr, and a beam from\nan external-cavity diode laser reflected from a mirror inside the cell allows for monitoring\nthe Rb density n0 in the cell, which is kept at n0 = 2.1 \u00d7 1010 cm\u22123 . Bulk condensation of\nRb vapor inside the fiber core is prevented by maintaining a constant temperature along the\nentire length of the fiber. In the absence of LIAD, a finite fraction of atoms diffuse a length z\ndown the fiber core of radius rf ib , and this atomic flux, which is proportional to the thermal\nvelocity, can be estimated in the Knudsen limit [27]. A steady-state condition, known as\n\"ripening\", is reached when this flux equals the rate of adsorption to the wall surface at\n4\n\n\fz [25]. For the PBGF in which Lf ib /rf ib \u2243 105 , this ripening time can be extremely large. For\nsimplicity, we rely on the Knudsen flow for the atoms to diffuse down the core. However, the\natomic flux can be significantly enhanced with techniques such as light-induced drift [28] or\ndipole-force guidance [19] into the core. The total number of atoms in the core is determined\nby monitoring the transmission of a weak laser beam coupled to the core and by scanning\nover the D1 transition. We take into account the density contribution due to the beam\npath in the cell before the fiber [Fig. 1(c)] and fit the resulting absorption trace to the\ntransmission coefficient,\n\u001a Z\nT (\u03c9) = exp \u2212\n\nLf ib\n\nn(z)dz\n0\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\u001b\n\n\u03c3(v, \u03b3, \u03c9)W (v)dv ,\n\u2212\u221e\n\n(1)\n\nwhere n(z) is the atomic density at position z in the core, and the atomic cross-section\n\u03c3(v, \u03b3, \u03c9) of the transition is a function of the atomic velocity v, the homogeneous linewidth\n\u03b3, and the laser frequency \u03c9. The cross-section is averaged over the Doppler profile W (v).\nFrom the fit of the experimental trace to Eq. 1, we estimate that in the absence of LIAD\nR L\nthe total number of atoms in the core to be Ncore = Af iber 0 f ib n(z)dz \u2243 1.93 \u00d7 103 , where\nAf iber is the cross-sectional area of the fiber core.\n\nIn our experiments, the intensity of the probe beam is maintained at 100 pW, which\nis an order of magnitude lower than the measured saturation power of 3 nW in the core.\nBy coupling a desorbing beam counterpropagating to the probe beam into the core and\ntuned far off resonance at 770 nm, we observe a dramatic increase in the total number of\natoms. Figure 2(a) shows that the atomic population undergoes a nearly instantaneous\nincrease by three orders of magnitude after the turn-on of the 1-mW desorbing beam, with\na maximum optical depth in excess of 2000. While a recent experiment [29] has reported\nRb desorption from porous silica, we have not observed measurable desorption in uncoated\nfibers. From the fitted absorption profile, we estimate a homogeneous linewidth of \u03b3 =\n96 MHz for the F = 1 \u2192 F \u2032 = 1, 2 transitions. The broadening associated with the\ndipole dephasing of the atoms colliding with core wall can be estimated from the wallcollisional frequency v\u0304/2rf ib \u224385 MHz, where v\u0304 is the thermal velocity, which suggests\nthat the dominant contribution to the homogeneous linewidth is due to the wall-collisional\ndephasing as opposed to atomic collisional broadening. This is consistent with our data that\nshows the linewidth to be nearly constant as a function of time as the density varies over\ntwo orders of magnitude.\n5\n\n\f6\n\nNumber of Atoms\n\n10 8\n\n5P1/2 F'=2\nF'=1\n\n4\n2\n5\n10 8\n\n812 MHz\n\n5S1/2 F=1\n\n4\n2\n4\n\n10 8\n4\n\n(a)\n\n2\n\nTransmission (Normalized)\n\n50\n\n55\n\n60\n65\nTime (secs)\n\n70\n\n75\n\n1.0\n0.8\n0.6\nBefore LIAD\nAfter 0.8 s\nAfter 6 s\nTheory\n\n0.4\n0.2\n0 (b)\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n40\n45\nDetuning (100 MHz)\n\n50\n\nFIG. 2: (a) Measurement of the number of Rb atoms in the core of the photonic band-gap fiber\nas a function of time, obtained from a theoretical fit to the transition shown in the inset.

(b) Corresponding variation in the number of\natoms adsorbed to the wall; the line in red illustrates the timing for the desorbing beam.\n\nterm is the contribution from the Nwall atoms stuck to the core walls. This increase consists\nof two contributions: a light-independent thermal desorption rate \u03b3T and a light-induced\ndesorption rate, which is proportional to the intensity Id of the desorbing beam at the core\nwall with a proportionality constant a. It is via this second process that the atomic density\nand the optical depth of the system can be varied. The last factor in Eq. 2 represents the\nrelaxation of the atomic number to the steady-state value Ncell = n0 Af ib Lf ib at a rate \u03be. An\nequation similar to Eq. 2 is assumed for Nwall , where the first two factors contribute with\nopposite signs, leading to an increase and decrease of atoms stuck to the walls, respectively.\nFig. 3(a) shows a plot of variation in the atomic population for various exposures of the\ndesorbing beam of 60\u03bcW , together with a fit of the adopted model. The model was fitted\nto the experiment up to time \u03c4B [Fig. 3(b)], and the subsequent comparison of the theory\nto the experiment shows excellent agreement.\nTo demonstrate the potential of this system to facilitate nonlinear optics at low-light\n7\n\n\flevels, we investigate EIT in a V -type system with a probe at 100 pW and with control\npowers as low as 10 nW; these control powers are smaller by more than a factor of 1000X\nthan what is typically used to achieve EIT in bulk geometries [30]. The probe is tuned\nto the F = 2 \u2192 F \u2032 = 1 transition of the D1 line of\n\n87\n\nRb at 795 nm, and a control field,\n\ncopropagating with the probe, is tuned to the F = 2 \u2192 F \u2032 = 3 transition of the D2 line\nat 780 nm. For this particular level scheme [inset of Fig. 4(b)], optical pumping between\nthe hyperfine levels is avoided, since the F = 1 \u2192 F \u2032 = 3 transition is dipole forbidden.\nFurthermore, the probe-field saturation and the optical pumping between the magnetic\nsublevels tend to cancel each other, and as a result the observed transparency is primarily\ndue to pure EIT [30]. To analyze this system, we solve the density-matrix equations for a\n3-level V system in steady state, with level a as the ground state and with b and c as the\ntwo excited states [Fig. 4(b)]. The coherence \u03c3ca to first order in the probe field is given\nby [13],\n\n\u03c3ca =\n\n\u2212i\u03a9p\n\n\u00d7\n2\nc | /4\n]\n2[\u03b3ac \u2212 i\u03b4p + \u03b3bc |\u03a9\n+i(\u03b4c \u2212\u03b4p )\n\u001a\n\u001b\n|\u03a9c |2 (\u03c10bb \u2212 \u03c10aa )\n0\n0\n(\u03c1cc \u2212 \u03c1aa ) \u2212\n,\n4(\u03b3bc + i\u03b4c )[\u03b3bc + i(\u03b4c \u2212 \u03b4p )]\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03a9c (\u03a9p ) and \u03b4c (\u03b4p ) are the Rabi frequency and detuning, respectively, for the control\n(probe) field, \u03c10ii , (i = a, b, c) are the steady-state population distributions, \u03b3ij = (\u03b3i +\u03b3j )/2+\n\u03b3ijcoll , (i, j = a, b, c) are the dephasing rates, and \u03b3i is the decay rate of level i. The imaginary\npart of the Doppler-averaged susceptibility, calculated from this coherence, is integrated over\nthe length of the fiber to fit to the transmission trace of the probe field.\nFigure 4 shows results in which a 1-mW desorbing beam releases Rb atoms into the core,\nand a series of probe transmission spectra are taken at ensuing time intervals. The time\n(250 ms) to obtain a trace is chosen to be long compared to the atomic time scales (100's\nns) but short compared to the time scales (secs) associated with the desorption dynamics\nof the atomic density in the core. The input power of the probe field is set to 100 pW,\nand that of the control field is varied from 10 nW to 3 \u03bcW. Figure 4(a) shows a typical\ntrace of the probe field transmission in presence of a 361-nW control field, together with\nthe corresponding theoretical fit as calculated from Eq. (3). Using the fitting procedure\ndescribed in [13], we estimate a decay rate for the coherence between the two upper states\n8\n\n\fTransmission (Normalized)\n\n1.0\n\n(a)\n\n1.0\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n0.2\n-4\n\n0.6\n\n4\n\n0\n\nExperiment\nTheory\n\n0.4\n-6\n\n-4\n\n-2\n0\n2\n4\nDetuning (100 MHz)\n\n6\n\n8\n\n(b)\nFWHM (MHz)\n\n140\n\nExperiment\nTheory\n\n100\nb\n\n5P3/2\nc\n\n60\n\n5P1/2\n\nControl\n\nProbe\n\na\n\n20\n\n5S1/2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n6\n8\nIntensity (W/cm 2 )\n\n10\n\nFIG. 4: (a) Transmission spectra of the probe field in presence of a 361-nW control field.

Figure 4(b) shows the measured transparency full-width at half maximum (FWHM)\ntogether with the corresponding FWHM calculated from Eq. 3. The error bar denotes the\nvariation in measurements which were taken at different time intervals of atomic desorption\n[ Fig 2(a)]. At higher powers or for transitions in which optical pumping and saturation\neffects contribute, larger than 90% transparencies are observed [see inset of Fig. 4(a)].\nIn conclusion, we have demonstrated a new technique to create a significant density of\n\n9\n\n\fRubidium vapor in the core of a PBGF and as a proof of concept, we have demonstrated EIT\nin this system with a control power as low as 10 nW which represents more than a factor\nof 107 reduction, as compared to acetylene-based EIT in PBGF [13, 17]. Such a system\nrepresents a new experimental geometry for performing nonlinear optics at extremely low\nlight levels due to its unmatched combination of strong light confinement and long interaction\nlengths with atoms of large optical cross-section.\nWe thank D.
