We analyze the observed properties of cosmic\ngamma-ray bursts, Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars and their CO-cores in the end of\nevolution. WR stars are deprived of their extended hydrogen envelopes, which\nmakes it easier for the collapse energy to transform into observed gamma-ray\nemission. Presently, of \u223c 90 well-localized gamma-ray bursts, 21 ones are optically identified and for 16 of them redshifts are measured (z = 0.4 \u00f7 4.5). The\nobserved energy of gamma-ray bursts spans over a wide range from 3 \u00d7 1051\nto 2 \u00d7 1054 ergs. There is some evidence that this distribution N (\u2206E) is\nbimodal if take into account GRB980425 associated with a peculiar type Ic\nsupernova SN1998bw in a nearby galaxy ESO 184-G82 for which \u2206E\u03b3 \u2248 1048\nergs. These characteristics of gamma-ray bursts are similar to the distribution\nof the final masses of CO-cores of WR stars which is also wide and homogeneous: MCO = (1 \u2212 2)M\u2299 \u00f7 (20 \u2212 44)M\u2299. A possible bimodality of the\ngamma-ray burst energy distribution (E1 = 1048 erg; \u2206E2 = 3\u00d71051 \u00f72\u00d71054\nerg) is in accord with the bimodal mass distribution of relativistic objects\n(MN S = (1.35 \u00b1 0.15)M\u2299; MBH = (4 \u00f7 15)M\u2299). That the supernova\nSN1998bw is of the \"peculiar Ic\" type, atypical for WR collapses (type Ib/c),\ncan be related to the rotation of the collapsing CO-core which can make the\ncollapse longer and lead to the formation of a neutron star, the decrease of\nthe gamma-ray burst energy, and the increase of the fraction of kinetic energy\ntransported to the envelope. The expected collapse rate of CO-cores of most\ncompact WR stars of type WO in the Galaxy is \u223c 10\u22125 per year, which is\nonly by one and a half order of magnitude higher than the average gamma-ray\nburst rate in one galaxy (\u223c 10\u22126 \u2212 10\u22127 per year). Two particular models\nthat use WR stars as gamma-ray burst progenitors are considered: the hypernova model by Paczy\u0144ski (1998) and the model of unstable CO-core collapse\nsuggested by Gershtein (2000). In both models the allowance of a gamma-ray\nbeaming or random outcome of the CO-core collapse due to some instabilities\npermits one to bring the rate of CO-core collapses in accordance with that\nof gamma-ray bursts. We argue that WR stars (most probably, of type WO)\ncan be considered as progenitors of cosmic gamma-ray bursts. Two types of\ngamma-ray bursts are predicted in correspondence with the bimodal mass distribution of the relativistic objects. Three types of optical afterglows should\nappear depending on which CO-core is collapsing: of a single WR star, of a\nWR star in a WR+O or a hypothetic WR+(A-M) binary system. In addition,\nwe briefly consider a model of gamma-ray bursts as a transient phenomenon\noccurring at early stages of galactic evolution (z > 1), when very massive\n1\n\n\f(M > 100M\u2299) low-metallicity stars could form. Such massive stars should\nalso loose their hydrogen envelopes and become massive WR stars whose collapses could be accompanied by gamma-ray bursts. WR-galaxies can be most\nprobable candidates for gamma-ray burst host galaxies.\n\nIntroduction\nThe principal requirements to the central engine of GRBs include (1) The ability to release the\nelectromagnetic energy \u223c 1052 ergs during 10-100 s (the typical duration of \"long\" GRBs, only for\nwhich X-ray and optical observations are possible; a separate group of short single-peak GRBs is\nmuch less studied, apart from the fact that they are isotropically distributed over the sky, and well\nmay be another phenomenon) and (2) The event rate is on average about one burst per typical galaxy\n(assuming isotropy of the emission and homogeneity of galaxies) per \u223c 107 years. The beaming of\ngamma-ray emission decreases the energy emitted and increases by the same amount the event rate.\nThese requirements are met (with different degree of accuracy) by two broad classes of astrophysical sources. The first class includes coalescencs of binary NS and/or BH [1]). The fireball\nis generated by neutrino-antineutrino annihilation copiously produced during the coalescence. The\nsecond class comprises models related to final stages of evolution of massive stars, among which:\n\u2022 Collapses of massive stars [2, 3, 4]. An accretion disk is formed around a massive rotating\nblack hole during late stages of the core collapse of a massive star; in this model, a narrow\njet is produced inside the star and punches through the stellar envelope reaching very high\nLorentz-factors.\n\u2022 Electromagnetic model by V.Usov [5], in which the energy comes from the rapid rotation of\na young neutron star (millisecond pulsar) with a very strong magnetic field. Other models in\nwhich magnetic field is crucial see in [6, 7].\n\u2022 GRB during core collapse of a non-rotating Wolf-Rayet star by Gershtein [8], in which the\ninternal shocks are created due to the collapse non-stationarity and energy is brought away by\nelectron-positron plasma.\nAt the late stages of evolution, very massive stars lose their hydrogen-rich envelopes (via stellar\nwind or in a binary system) and are observed as helium-rich Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars. They are\nconsidered as progenitors of Ib type supernovae (if strong helium lines are present in the maximum\nbrightness) or Ic supernova (if helium lines are weak or absent). If GRBs are directly related to\ncollapses to massive stars, there should be some links between properties of WR stars before collapse\n2\n\n\fand GRBs. We suggest that observed broad (and, possibly, bimodal) distribution of GRB energetics\nis related (1) to the broad distribution of final masses of CO cores of observed WR stars before\ncollapse and (2) to the observed bimodal distribution of masses of relativistic remnants of stellar\nevolution (neutron stars and black holes).\n\nGRB association with star formation\nThere is a growing evidence that cosmic GRBs are associated with star-forming regions:\n\u2022 Optical observations of the identified GRB host galaxies evidence for an enhanced star formation rate inside the GRB sites, sometimes by an order of magnitude higher than in our Galaxy\n[9].\n\u2022 Large column densities 1022 \u2212 1023 cm\u22122 toward GRBs derived from known X-ray and optical\nafterglows of GRBs [10], typical for giant molecular clouds.\n\u2022 Observed offset distribution of GRBs from their host galaxies statistically suggests association\nwith the location of massive stars [11].\n\u2022 Detections of line features in several GRB X-ray afterglows ([12] and references therein) imply\na dense surrounding.\nThis favors GRBs association with evolution of massive stars and makes other GRB progenitors\n(such as double neutron star coalescences) less likely.\n\nEnergetics of GRBs with known redshifts\nTable 1 lists GRBs with known energetics. Photometric distances are calculated using a flat Universe\nwith \u03a9m = 0.3, \u03a9\u039b = 0.7, H0 = 60 km/s/Mpc. The Table also contains BATSE fluences (50-300 keV)\nand peak luminosities Lp phot/s (from [20]).\nAs seen from Table 1 and Fig. 1, 2, the observed GRB energetics spans from \u2248 7 \u00d7 1051 ergs\nto \u2248 2 \u00d7 1054 ergs. This observational fact is usually explained by a broad luminosity function of\nGRBs (see [22], [23]), although one can construct a self-consistent model with a universal energy\nrelease of E0 \u223c 5 \u00d7 1051 ergs and a complex beam shape [24].

The\nwith the wide range of CO cores of WR stars before collapse, MCO\n\ntotal energy released in collapse is EG \u223c GMc2 /Rc , where Mc in the compact remnant mass, Rc its\nradius. During black hole formation in such collapses without mass ejection the available energy\ncan reach 1053 \u2212 1056 ergs for the observed mass range of compact remnants, i.e. conversion of 1%\nof the available energy into kinetic energy of shocks with subsequent radiation would be sufficient\nto explain the broad luminosity function. Note that during collapse into black hole without mass\nejection Rc \u221d Mc \u221d MCO and available energy range is proportional to the CO core mass range,\nwhich is likely to be the case.\n(2) Bimodality of GRB energy distribution and stellar remnant mass distribution. The\nknown masses of NS and BH in binaries are shown in Fig. 4. NS masses are groupped ina anarrow\ninterval is MN S = (1.35 \u00b1 0.15)M\u2299 , while BH masses fall in a broader range MBH = (5 \u00f7 15)M\u2299 . A\nreal gap between NS and BH masses is observed.\nGRBs with low energetics associated with peculiar supernovae type Ic (such as GRB980425) can\nbe explained by collapses of bare CO cores of massive stars with significant rotation which causes\nmost envelope to be ejected and neutron star to be formed, while collapses of slower rotating cores\n5\n\n\fFigure 3: Masses of final CO cores MCO of WR stars as calclated using observed stellar wind mass\nloss \u1e40 \u221d M \u03b1 . Masses of known NS and BH candidates in binary systems are also shown.\ndo not accompanied by a significant envelope ejection and lead to black hole formation. In the latter\ncase an energetic GRB can be generated with energy proportional to the pre-collapse core mass.\n(3) Association of GRBs with star-forming regions\n(4) A diversity of the observed afterglows A GRB in a binary system can induce different\noptical phenomena due to illumination of the companion's atmosphere by hard X-ray and gammaradiation [26]. This should add some light to the \"pure\" power-law afterglow from relativistic blast\nwave thus producing a great variety of the observed light curves. These effects can occur in a time\ninterval \u2206topt > D/c after the burst (D is the distance to the optical star from GRB, c is the speed\nof light). Deviations are indeed observed in some bursts (for example, in GRB980326 afterglow three\nweeks after the burst [27]).\nAstronomical observations indicate [28, 29, 30] that about 50% of all WR stars in our Galaxy can\n6\n\n\fFigure 4: Dependence of the masses mx of NS (circles) and BH (triangles and rectangles) on the\nmasses of their companion stars mV in close binary systems. Filled circles correspond to radio pulsars,\nfilled triangles to BH in X-ray novae.\nbe in binaries with O-star or A-M-star. For example, for WR+O system V444 Cyg with an orbital\nperiod of P = 4d .2 we have D \u2248 40R\u2299 and the time delay \u2206topt \u2248 100 s, and for parameters of\nWR+O binary system CV Ser \u2206topt \u2248 300 s. An extremely bright optical emission (V \u2243 9m ) was\nobserved in the famous burst GRB990123 only 50 s after the burst beginning [31].\nAnother example is a peculiar shape of achromatic optical afterglow light curve observed in\nGRB000301c [32, 21]. The observed several peaks separated by 2-3 days days can be a manifestation\nof an orbital period in the underlied binary system, for example, through the binary-period shaped\nmass loss before collapse. An alternative explanation by a microlensing event [33] seems less probable.\nOrbital periods of order of several days perfectly fit the observed period range 1d .6 \u00f72900d in WR+O\nbinary systems (see Table 2 in [25]).\n7\n\n\fThese arguments favor the GRB-WR stars association, but there is a general requirement which\nshould be met by all viable GRB models. The point is that GRB phenomenon should be an extremely\nrare astronomical event.\n\nEvent rate problem\nThe GRB event rate per unit comoving volume using BATSE data with Ftr = 0.1 ph/cm2 [34] is\nRGRB \u223c 10\u22129 GRB/yr/Mpc3 ,\ni.e about 10\u22127 per year in the average galaxy with a mass of 1011 M\u2299 . This is by several orders\nof magnitude lower than the total rate of core collapses associated with SN II and Ibc (RSN Ibc \u223c\n3 \u00d710\u22125 /yr/Mpc3 , [35]). This discrepancy is usually eliminated by introducing a beaming of gammaray emission (e.g. [20]). It is not excluded that not each SN Ibc is associated with GRB for internal\nreasons.\nThe mean formation rate of all types of WR stars in the Galaxy is\nRW R = R\u2299\n\n1\nNW R \u2206t\u2299\n\u223c\nyr\u22121 .\nN\u2299 \u2206tW R\n1000\n\n(1)\n\ni.e. by a factor of 1000 exceeds that of GRBs. The most compact WR stars, so called WO stars,\nare much less frequent (3 out of total 200 are known in the Galaxy), so their formation rate is only\nby one order of magnitude higher than that of GRB. This issue can be solved either by postulating\ngenerically thin jets or, admitting quasi-spherically symmetric emission, by assuming the existence\nof some \"hidden\" collapse parameters (rotation, magnetic field, etc.), which was suggested by [36]\nfrom an independent analysis of black hole formation in binaries.\nIn the hypernova scenario by Paczy\u0144ski [3] the rarity of GRB phenomenon is also explained by\nrequiring an extremely high magnetic field during core collapse of a rotating massive star into a 10\nM\u2299 black hole.\nIn contrast, in the model of coalescing neutron star/black hole binaries (which is currently less\nfavored by association of all observed GRB hosts with strong star forming regions, see above) the\nevent rates varies from \u223c 10\u22124 to \u223c 10\u22126 per year depending on the binary evolution parameters\n[37], which is marginally consistent with the observed GRB rate and the event rate problem is not\nvery strong.\n\nGRBs as a transient galactic phenomenon\nThere is another possibility to explain the observed association of cosmic GRBs with star-forming\nregions at high redshifts and their extreme rarity. GRBs may represent a transient galactic phe8\n\n\fnomenon occurring at the early stages of galactic evolution, like quasars and AGNs. It is established\nnow [38] that at high redshifts z \u223c 1 \u2212 2 a violent epoch of star formation in young galaxies occurred.\nIt is also known that a lot of cold matter were bound in giant proto-galactic clouds at redshifts z > 2,\nwhich are observed as \"Lyman-alpha forest\" of absorption lines in quasar spectra. The formation of\nvery massive stars 100-500 M\u2299 which final collapse into massive black holes took place at that epoch.\nSuch massive star can not form from matter enriched with metals because of pulsational instabilities\n(see [39] and references therein). At low metallicity at the epoch of violent star formation, however,\nthey could have formed. The possibility of energetic GRBs from collapses of such massive stars was\nstudied in [40] with negative conclusion about their ability to produce an energetic GRB. But we\nnote here that physical processes in such stars are still far from full understanding and potentially\nsuch stars could be GRB progenitors. The weakness of GRB980425 in a nearby galaxy can be a natural consequence of smaller upper masses of stars in regions of violent star formation at the present\nepoch.\n\n9\n\n\fReferences\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n[17]\n[18]\n[19]\n[20]\n[21]\n[22]\n[23]\n[24]\n[25]\n[26]\n[27]\n[28]\n[29]\n[30]\n[31]\n[32]\n[33]\n[34]\n[35]\n[36]\n[37]\n[38]\n[39]\n[40]\n\nBlinnikov S.I., et al.
