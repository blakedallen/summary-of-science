HOWE, KRISTIN E. LAUTER, AND JAAP TOP\nAbstract. A curve over a field k is pointless if it has no k-rational points.\nWe show that there exist pointless genus-3 hyperelliptic curves over a finite\nfield Fq if and only if q \u2264 25, that there exist pointless smooth plane quartics\nover Fq if and only if either q \u2264 23 or q = 29 or q = 32, and that there exist\npointless genus-4 curves over Fq if and only if q \u2264 49.\n\n1. Introduction\nHow many points can there be on a curve of genus g over a finite field Fq ?\nResearchers have been studying variants of this question for several decades. As\nvan der Geer and van der Vlugt write in the introduction to their biannuallyupdated survey of results related to certain aspects of this subject, the attention\npaid to this question is\nmotivated partly by possible applications in coding theory and\ncryptography, but just as well by the fact that the question represents an attractive mathematical challenge. [4]\nThe complementary question - how few points can there be on a curve of genus\ng over Fq ? - seems to have sparked little interest among researchers, perhaps\nbecause of the apparent lack of possible applications for such curves in coding\ntheory or cryptography. But despite the paucity of applications, there are still\nmathematical challenges associated with such curves. In this paper, we address one\nof them:\nProblem. Given an integer g \u2265 0, determine the finite fields k such that there\nexists a curve of genus g over k having no rational points.\nWe will call a curve over a field k pointless if it has no k-rational points. Thus\nthe problem we propose is to determine, for a given genus g, the finite fields k for\nwhich there is a pointless curve of genus g.\nThe solutions to this problem for g \u2264 2 are known. There are no pointless curves\nof genus 0 over any finite field; this follows from Wedderburn's theorem, as is shown\nby [16, \u00a7 III.1.4, exer. 3]. The Weil bound for curves of genus 1 over a finite field,\nproven by Hasse [5], shows that there are no pointless curves of genus 1 over any\nfinite field. If there is a pointless curve of genus 2 over a finite field Fq then the\nWeil bound shows that q \u2264 13, and in 1972 Stark [19] showed that in fact q < 13.\nFor each q < 13 there do exist pointless genus-2 curves over Fq ; a complete list of\nthese curves is given in [13, Table 4].\nDate: 1 March 2004.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification.

HOWE, KRISTIN E. LAUTER, AND JAAP TOP\n\nIn this paper we provide solutions for the cases g = 3 and g = 4.\nTheorem 1. There exists a pointless genus-3 curve over Fq if and only if either\nq \u2264 25 or q = 29 or q = 32.\nTheorem 2. There exists a pointless genus-4 curve over Fq if and only if q \u2264 49.\nIn fact, for genus-3 curves we prove a statement slightly stronger than Theorem 1:\nTheorem 3.\n(1) There exists a pointless genus-3 hyperelliptic curve over Fq if and only if q \u2264\n25.\n(2) There exists a pointless smooth plane quartic curve over Fq if and only if\neither q \u2264 23 or q = 29 or q = 32.\nThe idea of the proofs of these theorems is simple. For any given genus g, and\nin particular for g = 3 and g = 4, the Weil bound can be used to provide an upper\nbound for the set of prime powers q such that there exist pointless curves of genus\ng over Fq . For each q less than or equal to this bound, we either provide a pointless\ncurve of genus g or use the techniques of [8] to prove that none exists.\nWe wrote above that the question of how few points there can be on a genusg curve over Fq seems to have attracted little attention, and this is certainly the\nimpression one gets from searching the literature for references to such curves.\nOn the other hand, the question has undoubtedly occurred to researchers before.\nIndeed, the third author was asked this very question for the special case g = 3 by\nboth N. D. Elkies and J.-P. Serre after the appearance of his joint work [1] with\nAuer. Also, while it is true that there seem to be no applications for pointless\ncurves, it can be useful to know whether or not they exist. For example, Leep\nand Yeomans were concerned with the existence of pointless plane quartics in their\nwork [12] on explicit versions of special cases of the Ax-Kochen theorem. Finally,\nwe note that Clark and Elkies have recently proven that for every fixed prime p\nthere is a constant Ap such that for every integer n > 0 there is a curve over Fp of\ngenus at most Ap npn that has no places of degree n or less.\nIn Section 2 we give the heuristic that guided us in our search for pointless\ncurves. In Section 3 we give the arguments that show that there are no pointless\ncurves of genus 3 over F27 or F31 , no pointless smooth plane quartics over F25 , no\npointless genus-3 hyperelliptic curves over F29 or F32 , and no pointless curves of\ngenus 4 over F53 or F59 . Finally, in Sections 4 and 5 we give examples of pointless\ncurves of genus 3 and 4 over every finite field for which such curves exist.\nConventions. By a curve over a field k we mean a smooth, projective, geometrically irreducible 1-dimensional variety over k. When we define a curve by a set\nof equations, we mean the normalization of the projective closure of the variety\ndefined by the equations.\nAcknowledgments.

Several of our Magma programs are available on the\nweb: start at\nhttp://www.alumni.caltech.edu/~however/biblio.html\nand follow the links related to this paper. One of our proofs depends on an explicit\ndescription of the isomorphism classes of unimodular quaternary Hermitian forms\nover the quadratic ring of discriminant \u221211. The web site mentioned above also\ncontains a copy of a text file that gives a list of the six isomorphism classes of such\nforms; we obtained this file from the web site\nhttp://www.math.uni-sb.de/~ag-schulze/Hermitian-lattices/\nmaintained by Rainer Schulze-Pillot-Ziemen.\n2. Heuristics for constructing pointless curves\nTo determine the correct statements of Theorems 1 and 2 we began by searching\nfor pointless curves of genus 3 and 4 over various small finite fields. In this section\nwe explain the heuristic we used to find families of curves in which pointless curves\nmight be abundant. We begin with a lemma from the theory of function fields over\nfinite fields.\nLemma 4. Let L/K be a degree-d extension of function fields over a finite field k,\nlet M be the Galois closure of L/K, let G = Gal(M/K), and let H = Gal(M/L).\nLet S be the set of places p of K that are unramified in L/K and for which there is\nat least one place q of L, lying over p, with the same residue field as p. Then the\nset S has a Dirichlet density in the set of all places of K unramified in L/K, and\nthis density is\n# \u222a\u03c4 \u2208G H \u03c4\n.\n\u03b4 :=\n#G\nWe have \u03b4 \u2265 1/d, with equality precisely when L is a Galois extension of K.\nFurthermore, we have \u03b4 \u2264 1 \u2212 (d \u2212 1)/#G.\nProof. An easy exercise in the class field theory of function fields (cf. [6, proof of\nLemma 2]) shows that the set S is precisely the set of places p whose Artin symbol\n(p, L/K) lies in the union of the conjugates of H in G. The density statement then\nfollows from the Chebotarev density theorem.\nSince H is an index-d subgroup of G, we have\n# \u222a\u03c4 \u2208G H \u03c4\n#H\n1\n\u2265\n= .\n#G\n#G\nd\nIf L/K is Galois then H is trivial and the first relation in the displayed equation\nabove is an equality. If L/K is not Galois then H is a nontrivial non-normal\nsubgroup of G, so the first relation above is an inequality.\nTo prove the upper bound on \u03b4, we note that two conjugates H \u03c3 and H \u03c4 of H are\nidentical when \u03c3 and \u03c4 lie in the same coset of H in G, so when we form the union\nof the conjugates of H we need only let \u03c4 range over a set of coset representatives\nof the d cosets of H in G. Furthermore, the identity element lies in every conjugate\nof H, so the union of the conjugates of H contains at most d*#H \u2212(d\u22121) elements.\nThe upper bound follows.\n\u0003\n\n\f4\n\nEVERETT W. HOWE, KRISTIN E. LAUTER, AND JAAP TOP\n\nNote that the density mentioned in Lemma 4 is a Dirichlet density. If the\nconstant field of K is algebraically closed in the Galois closure of L/K, then the\nset S also has a natural density (see [14]). In particular, the set S has a natural\ndensity when L/K is a Galois extension and L and K have the same constant field.\nLemma 4 leads us to our main heuristic:\nHeuristic. Let C \u2192 D be a degree-d cover of curves over Fq , let L/K be the\ncorresponding extension of function fields, and let \u03b4 be the density from Lemma 4.\nIf the constant field of the Galois closure of L/K is equal to Fq , then C will be\npointless with probability (1 \u2212 \u03b4)#D(Fq ) . In particular, if C \u2192 D is a Galois cover,\nthen C will be pointless with probability (1 \u2212 1/d)#D(Fq ) .\nJustification. Lemma 4 makes it reasonable to expect that with probability 1 \u2212 \u03b4,\na given rational point of D will have no rational points of C lying over it. Our\nheuristic follows if we assume that all of the points of D behave independently. \u0003\nConsider what this heuristic tells us about hyperelliptic curves. Since a hyperelliptic curve is a double cover of a genus-0 curve, we expect that a hyperelliptic curve\nover Fq will be pointless with probability (1/2)q+1 . However, if the hyperelliptic\ncurve has more automorphisms than just the hyperelliptic involution, it will be\nmore likely to be pointless. For instance, suppose C is a hyperelliptic curve whose\nautomorphism group has order 4. This automorphism group will give us a Galois\ncover C \u2192 P1 of degree 4. Then our heuristic suggests that C will be pointless\nwith probability (3/4)q+1 .\nOn the other hand, consider a generic smooth plane quartic C over Fq . A generic\nquartic has a 1-parameter family of non-Galois maps of degree 3 to P1 . For any\none of these maps, the Galois group of its Galois closure is the symmetric group on\n3 elements. In this case, the density \u03b4 from Lemma 4 is 2/3, so we expect (modulo\nthe condition on constant fields mentioned in the heuristic) that a typical plane\nquartic will be pointless with probability (1/3)q+1 . But if the quartic C has an\nautomorphism group of order 4, and if the quotient of C by this automorphism\ngroup is P1 , then we expect C to be pointless with probability (3/4)q+1 .\nThis heuristic suggested two things to us. First, to find pointless curves it is\nhelpful to look for curves with larger-than-usual automorphism groups. We decided\nto focus on curves whose automorphism groups contain the Klein 4-group, because\nit is easy to write down curves with this automorphism group and yet the group\nis large enough to give us a good chance of finding pointless curves. Second, the\nheuristic suggested that we look at curves C that are double covers of curves D that\nare double covers of P1 . The Galois group of the resulting degree-4 cover C \u2192 P1\nwill typically be the dihedral group of order 8, and the heuristic predicts that C will\nbe pointless with probability (5/8)q+1 . For a fixed D, if we consider the family of\ndouble covers C \u2192 D with C of genus 3 or 4, our heuristic predicts that C will be\npointless with probability (1/2)#D(Fq ) . If #D(Fq ) is small enough, this probability\ncan be reasonably high.\nThe curves that we found by following our heuristic are listed in Sections 4 and 5.\n3. Proofs of the theorems\nIn this section we prove the theorems stated in the introduction. Clearly Theorem 1 follows from Theorem 3, so we will only prove Theorems 2 and 3.\n\n\fPOINTLESS CURVES\n\n5\n\nProof of Theorem 3. The Weil bound says that a curve of genus 3 over Fq has at\n\u221a\nleast q + 1 \u2212 6 q points, and it follows immediately that if there is a pointless\ngenus-3 curve over Fq then q < 33. In Section 4 we give examples of pointless\ngenus-3 hyperelliptic curves over Fq for q \u2264 25 and examples of pointless smooth\nplane quartics for q \u2264 23, for q = 29, and for q = 31. To complete the proof, we\nneed only prove the following statements:\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\n(5)\n\nThere\nThere\nThere\nThere\nThere\n\nare\nare\nare\nare\nare\n\nno\nno\nno\nno\nno\n\npointless\npointless\npointless\npointless\npointless\n\ngenus-3 curves over F31 .\ngenus-3 curves over F27 .\nsmooth plane quartics over F25 .\ngenus-3 hyperelliptic curves over F32 .\ngenus-3 hyperelliptic curves over F29 .\n\nStatement 1. Theorem 1 of [11] shows that every genus-3 curve over F31 has at\nleast 2 rational points, and statement 1 follows.\nStatement 2. To prove statement 2, we begin by running the Magma program\nCheckQGN described in [8]. The output of CheckQGN(27,3,0) shows that if C is a\npointless genus-3 curve over F27 then the real Weil polynomial of C (see [8]) must\nbe (x \u2212 10)2 (x \u2212 8). (To reach this conclusion without relying on the computer, one\ncan adapt the reasoning on 'defect 2' found in [10, \u00a7 2].) Applying Proposition 13\nof [8], we find that C must be a double cover of an elliptic curve over F27 with\nexactly 20 rational points.\nUp to Galois conjugacy, there are two elliptic curves over F27 with exactly 20\nrational points; one is given by y 2 = x3 + 2x2 + 1 and the other by y 2 = x3 + 2x2 + a,\nwhere a3 \u2212 a + 1 = 0. By using the argument given in the analogous situation in [8,\n\u00a7 6.1], we see that every genus-3 double cover of one of these two E's can be obtained\nby adjoining to the function field of E an element z that satisfies z 2 = f , where\nf is a function on E of degree at most 6 that is regular outside \u221e, that has four\nzeros or poles of odd order, and that has a double zero at a point Q of E that is\nrational over F27 . In fact, it suffices to consider Q's that represent the classes of\nE(F27 )/2E(F27 ). The first E given above has four such classes and the second has\ntwo. We can also demand that the representative points Q not be 2-torsion points.\nThe divisor of the function f is\nP1 + P2 + P3 + P4 + 2Q \u2212 6\u221e\nfor some geometric points P1 , . . . , P4 . We are assuming that the double cover C\nhas no rational points, so none of the Pi can be rational over F27 . In particular,\nnone of the Pi is equal to the infinite point. Since Q is also not the infinite point\n(because we chose it not to be a 2-torsion point), we see that the degree of f is\nexactly 6.\nIt is easy to have Magma enumerate, for each of the six (E, Q) pairs, all of the\ndegree-6 functions f on E that have double zeros at Q. For each such f we can\ncheck to see whether there is a rational point P on E such that f (P ) is a nonzero\nsquare; if there is such a point, then the double D cover of E given by z 2 = f would\nhave a rational point. For those functions f for which such a P does not exist, we\ncan check to see whether the divisor of f has the right form. If the divisor of f\ndoes have the right form, we can compute whether the curve D has a rational point\nlying over Q or over \u221e.\n\n\f6\n\nEVERETT W. HOWE, KRISTIN E. LAUTER, AND JAAP TOP\n\nWe wrote Magma routines to perform these calculations; they are available on the\nweb at the URL mentioned in the acknowledgments. As it happens, no (E, Q) pair\ngives rise to a function f that passes the first two tests described in the preceding\nparagraph, so we never had to perform the third test.\nOur conclusion is that there are no pointless genus-3 curves over F27 , which\ncompletes the proof of statement 2.\nStatement 3. To prove statement 3 we start by running CheckQGN(25,3,0). We\nfind that the real Weil polynomial of a pointless genus-3 curve over F25 is either\nf1 := (x \u2212 10)2 (x \u2212 6) or f2 := (x \u2212 10)(x2 \u2212 16x + 62) or f3 := (x \u2212 10)(x \u2212 9)(x \u2212 7)\nor f4 := (x \u2212 10)(x \u2212 8)2 . (This list can also be obtained by using Table 4 and\nTheorem 1(a) of [8].)\nWe begin by considering the real Weil polynomial f1 = (x\u2212 10)2 (x\u2212 6). Suppose\nC is a genus-3 curve over F25 with real Weil polynomial equal to f1 . Arguing as in\nthe proof of [8, Cor. 12], we find that there is an exact sequence\n0 \u2192 \u2206 \u2192 A \u00d7 E \u2192 Jac C \u2192 0,\nwhere A is an abelian surface with real Weil polynomial (x \u2212 10)2 , where E is an\nelliptic curve with real Weil polynomial x \u2212 6, where \u2206 is a self-dual finite group\nscheme that is killed by 4, and where the projections from A\u00d7 E to A and to E give\nmonomorphisms \u2206 \u0592\u2192 A and \u2206 \u0592\u2192 E. Furthermore, there are polarizations \u03bbA and\n\u03bbE on A and E whose kernels are the images of \u2206 under these monomorphisms,\nand the polarization on Jac C induced by the product polarization \u03bbA \u00d7 \u03bbE is the\ncanonical polarization on Jac C.\nSince \u2206 is isomorphic to the kernel of \u03bbE and since \u2206 is killed by 4, we see that\nif \u2206 is not trivial then it is isomorphic to either E[2] or E[4]. If \u2206 were trivial\nthen Jac C would be equal to A \u00d7 E and the canonical polarization on Jac C would\nbe a product polarization, and this is not possible. Therefore \u2206 is isomorphic\neither to E[2] or E[4]. Since the Frobenius endomorphism of A is equal to the\nmultiplication-by-5 map on A, the group of geometric 4-torsion points on A is a\ntrivial Galois module. But E[4] is not a trivial Galois module, so we see that \u2206\nmust be isomorphic to E[2]. Arguing as in the proof of [8, Prop. 13], we find that\nthere must be a degree-2 map from C to E.\nThus, to find the genus-3 curves over F25 whose real Weil polynomials are equal\nto (x \u2212 10)2 (x \u2212 6), we need only look at the genus-3 curves that are double covers\nof elliptic curves over F25 with 20 points and with three rational points of order 2.\nThere are two such elliptic curves, and, as in the proof of statement 2, we can use\nMagma to enumerate their genus-3 double covers with no points. (Our Magma\nprogram is available at the URL mentioned in the acknowledgments.) We find that\nthere is exactly one such double cover: if a is an element of F25 with a2 \u2212 a + 2 = 0,\nthen the double cover C of the elliptic curve y 2 = x3 + 2x given by setting z 2 =\na(x2 \u2212 2) has no points.\nThe curve C is clearly hyperelliptic, because it is a double cover of the genus-0\ncurve z 2 = a(x2 \u2212 2). By parametrizing this genus-0 curve and manipulating the\nresulting equation for C, we find that C is isomorphic to the curve y 2 = a(x8 + 1),\nwhich is the example presented below in Section 4.\nNext we show that there are no pointless genus-3 curves over F25 with real Weil\npolynomial equal to f2 or f3 or f4 .\n\n\fPOINTLESS CURVES\n\n7\n\nSuppose C is a pointless genus-3 curve over F25 whose real Weil polynomial is\nf2 or f3 or f4 . By applying Proposition 13 of [8], we find that C must be a double\ncover of an elliptic curve over F25 having either 16 or 17 points. There is one\nelliptic curve over F25 of each of these orders. As we did above and in the proof\nof statement 2, we can easily have Magma enumerate the genus-3 double covers of\nthese elliptic curves. The only complication is that for the curve with 16 points, we\ncannot assume that the auxiliary point Q mentioned in the proof of statement 2 is\nnot a 2-torsion point.\nThe Magma program we used to enumerate these double covers can be found\nat the web site mentioned in the acknowledgments. Using this program, we found\nthat the curve with 17 points has no pointless genus-3 double covers. On the other\nhand, we found two functions f on the curve E with 16 points such that the double\ncover of E defined by z 2 = f is a pointless genus-3 curve. But when we computed\nan upper bound for the number of points on these curves over F625 , we found that\nboth of the curves have at most 540 points over F625 . This upper bound is not\nconsistent with any of the three real Weil polynomials we are considering. (In fact,\none can show by direct computation that the two curves are isomorphic to the curve\ny 2 = a(x8 + 1) that we found earlier, whose real Weil polynomial is f1 .) Thus, there\nare no pointless genus-3 curves over F25 with real Weil polynomial equal to f2 or\nf3 or f4 .\nThis proves statement 3.\nStatement 4. Suppose that C is a pointless genus-3 curve over F32 . If C were\nhyperelliptic, then its quadratic twist would be a genus-3 curve over F32 with 66\nrational points. But [10, Thm. 1] shows that no such curve exists.\nWe give a second proof of statement 4 as well, which provides us with a little\nextra information and foreshadows some of our later arguments. This same proof\nis given in [3, \u00a7 3.3] and attributed to Serre.\nSuppose that C is a pointless genus-3 curve over F32 . Then C meets the WeilSerre lower bound, and (as Serre shows in [18]) its Jacobian is therefore isogenous\nto the cube of an elliptic curve E over F32 whose trace of Frobenius is 11. Note that\nthe endomorphism ring of this elliptic curve is the quadratic order O of discriminant\n112 \u2212 4 * 32 = \u22127. The polarizations of abelian varieties isogenous to a power of a\nsingle elliptic curve whose endomorphism ring is a maximal order can be understood\nin terms of Hermitian modules (see the appendix to [11]). Since the endomorphism\nring O is a maximal order and a PID, there is exactly one abelian variety in the\nisogeny class of E 3 , namely E 3 itself. Furthermore, the theory of Hermitian modules\nshows that the principal polarizations of E 3 correspond to the isomorphism classes\nof unimodular Hermitian forms on the O-module O3 . Hoffmann [7] shows that there\nis only one isomorphism class of indecomposable unimodular Hermitian forms on\nO3 , so there is at most one Jacobian in the isogeny class of E 3 , and hence at most\none genus-3 curve over F32 with no points. The example we give in Section 4 is a\nplane quartic, so there are no pointless genus-3 hyperelliptic curves over F32 . This\nproves statement 4.\nStatement 5. We wrote a Magma program to find (by enumeration) all pointless\ngenus-3 hyperelliptic curves over an arbitrary finite field Fq of odd characteristic\nwith q > 7. We applied our program to the field F29 , and we found no curves. Our\nMagma program is available at the URL mentioned in the acknowledgments.\n\u0003\n\n\f8\n\nEVERETT W. HOWE, KRISTIN E. LAUTER, AND JAAP TOP\n\nNote that in the course of proving Theorem 3 we showed that the pointless genus3 curves over F25 and F32 exhibited in Section 4 are the only such curves over their\nrespective fields. Also, our program to enumerate pointless genus-3 hyperelliptic\ncurves shows that there is only one pointless genus-3 hyperelliptic curve over F23 .\nProof of Theorem 2. It follows from Serre's refinement of the Weil bound [17, Th\u00e9or\u00e8me 1] that if a curve of genus 4 over Fq has no rational points, then q \u2264 59. In\nSection 5 we give examples of pointless genus-3 curves over Fq for all q with q \u2264 49,\nso to prove the theorem we must show that there are no pointless genus-4 curves\nover F53 or F59 .\nCombining the output of CheckQGN(53,4,0) with Theorem 1(b) of [8], we find\nthat a pointless genus-4 curve over F53 must be a double cover of an elliptic curve\nE over F53 with exactly 42 points. (Again, the information obtained by running\nCheckQGN can also be obtained without recourse to the computer by modifying the\n'defect 2' arguments in [10, \u00a7 2].)\nThere are four elliptic curves E over F53 with exactly 42 points. Following the\narguments of [8, \u00a7 6.1], we find that every genus-4 double cover of such an E can\nbe obtained by adjoining to the function field of E a root of an equation z 2 = f ,\nwhere f is a function on E whose divisor is of the form\nP1 + * * * + P6 + 2Q \u2212 8\u221e,\n\nwhere Q is a rational point of E that is not killed by 2, and where it suffices\nto consider Q that cover the residue classes of E(F53 ) modulo 3E(F53 ). As in the\npreceding proof, we wrote Magma programs to enumerate the genus-4 double covers\nof the four possible E's and to check to see whether all of these covers had rational\npoints. Our programs, available at the URL mentioned in the acknowledgments,\nshowed that every genus-4 double cover of these E's has a rational point. Thus\nthere are no pointless genus-4 curves over F53 .\nNext we show that there are no pointless curves of genus 4 over F59 . If C were\nsuch a curve, then C would meet the Weil-Serre lower bound, and therefore the\nJacobian of C would be isogenous to the fourth power of an elliptic curve E over\nF59 with 45 points. Note that there is exactly one such E, and its endomorphism\nring O is the quadratic order of discriminant \u221211. As in the proof of statement 4 of\nthe proof of Theorem 3, we see that there is only one abelian variety in the isogeny\nclass of E 4 , and principal polarizations of E 4 correspond to the isomorphism classes\nof unimodular Hermitian forms on the O-module O4 . Schiemann [15] states that\nthere are six isomorphism classes of unimodular Hermitian forms on the module O4 .\nWe were unable to find a listing of these isomorphism classes at the URL mentioned\nin [15], but we did find them by following links from the URL\nhttp://www.math.uni-sb.de/~ag-schulze/Hermitian-lattices/\nWe have put a copy of the page listing these six forms on the web site mentioned\nin the acknowledgments.\nThree of the isomorphism classes of unimodular Hermitian forms on O4 are\ndecomposable, and so do not come from the Jacobian of a curve. The three indecomposable Hermitian forms can each be written as a matrix with an upper left\nentry of 2. Arguing as in the proof of [8, Prop. 13], we find that our curve C must\nbe a double cover of the curve E.\nWe are again in familiar territory. As above, it is an easy matter to write\na Magma program to enumerate the genus-4 double covers of the given elliptic\n\n\fPOINTLESS CURVES\n\n9\n\ncurve E and to check that they all have a rational point. (Our Magma programs\nare available at the URL mentioned in the acknowledgments.) Our computation\nshowed that there are no pointless curves of genus 4 over F59 .\n\u0003\n4. Examples of pointless curves of genus 3\nIn this section we give examples of pointless curves of genus 3 over the fields\nwhere such curves exist. We only consider curves whose automorphism groups\ncontain the Klein 4-group V . We begin with the hyperelliptic curves.\nSuppose C is a genus-3 hyperelliptic curve over Fq whose automorphism group\ncontains a copy of V , and assume that the hyperelliptic involution is contained in V .\nThen V modulo the hyperelliptic involution acts on C modulo the hyperelliptic\ninvolution, and gives us an involution on P1 . By changing coordinates on P1 , we\nmay assume that the involution on P1 is of the form x 7\u2192 n/x for some n \u2208 F\u2217q .\n(When q is odd we need consider only two values of n, one a square and one a\nnonsquare. When q is even we may take n = 1.)\nIt follows that when q is odd the curve C can be defined either by an equation\nof the form y 2 = f (x + n/x), where f is a separable quartic polynomial coprime to\nx2 \u2212 4n, or by an equation of the form y 2 = xf (x + n/x), where f is a separable\ncubic polynomial coprime to x2 \u2212 4n. However, the latter possibility cannot occur\nif C is to be pointless. When q is even, if we assume the curve if ordinary then it\nmay be written in the form y 2 + y = f (x + 1/x), where f is a rational function with\n2 simple poles, both nonzero.\nWe wrote a simple Magma program to search for pointless hyperelliptic curves\nof this form. We found such curves for every q in\n{2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 16, 17, 19, 23, 25}.\n\nWe give examples in Table 1.\nNow we turn to the pointless smooth plane quartics. We searched for pointless\nquartics of the form\nax4 + by 4 + cz 4 + dx2 y 2 + ex2 z 2 + f y 2 z 2 = 0\nover finite fields of odd characteristic, because the automorphism groups of such\nquartics clearly contain the Klein group. We found pointless quartics of this form\nover Fq for q in\n{5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29}.\nWe present sample curves in Table 2.\nOver F3 there are many pointless smooth plane quartics; for instance, the curve\nx4 + xyz 2 + y 4 + y 3 z \u2212 yz 3 + z 4 = 0\n\nhas no points.\nWe know from the proof of Theorem 3 that there is at most one pointless genus3 curve over F32 , and its Jacobian is isomorphic to the cube of an elliptic curve\nwhose endomorphism ring has discriminant \u22127. This suggests that we should look\nat twists of the reduction of the Klein quartic, and indeed we find that the curve\n(x2 + x)2 + (x2 + x)(y 2 + y) + (y 2 + y)2 + 1 = 0\nhas no points over F32 . (This fact is noted in [3, \u00a7 3.3].) For the other fields of\ncharacteristic 2, we find examples by modifying the example for F32 . We list the\nresults in Table 3.\n\n\f10\n\nEVERETT W.

Suppose C is a genus-3 curve over a field of characteristic not 2, and\nsuppose that C has a pair of commuting involutions (like the curves we considered in\nthis section). Then either C is an unramified double cover of a genus-2 curve, or C is\na genus-3 curve of the type considered in [9, \u00a7 4], that is, a genus-3 curve obtained\nby 'gluing' three elliptic curves together along portions of their 2-torsion. This\nsuggests a more direct method of constructing genus-3 curves with no points: We\ncan start with three elliptic curves with few points, and try to glue them together\nusing the construction from [9, \u00a7 4]. This idea was used by the third author to\nconstruct genus-3 curves with many points [20].\n5.

Examples of pointless curves of genus 4 over Fq (with\nq odd) with automorphism group containing the Klein 4-group.\n\nWe mention two points of interest about curves of this form. First, if the Fq vector subspace of Fq [x] spanned by the cubic polynomials f and g contains the\nconstant polynomial 1, then the curve C defined by the two equations y 2 = f and\nz 2 = g is trigonal: If we have af + bg = 1, then (x, y, z) 7\u2192 (y, z) defines a degree-3\nmap from C to the genus-0 curve ay 2 + bz 2 = 1. Second, if q \u2261 1 mod 3 and if\nthe coefficients of x and x2 in f and g are zero, then the curve C has even more\nautomorphisms, given by multiplying x by a cube root of unity. (Likewise, if q is a\npower of 3 and if f and g are both of the form a(x3 \u2212 x) + b, then x 7\u2192 x + 1 gives\nan automorphism of C.) When it was possible, we chose the examples in Table 4\nto have these properties. In Table 5 we provide trigonal models for the curves in\nTable 4 that have them.\nIt remains for us to find examples of pointless genus-4 curves over F2 , F4 , F8 , F16 ,\nand F32 .\n\n\fPOINTLESS CURVES\n\nq\n\nliftable involutions of P1\n\ncurve\n\n3 v 3 \u2212 v = (u4 + 1)/(u2 + 1)2\n3\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n5 v \u2212 v = \u22122(u \u2212 2) /(u + 2)\n3\n\n13\n\n6\n\n7 v = 2u + 2\n3\n\n4\n\n2\n\n2\n\n5 2\n\n9 v \u2212 v = (u + a )/(u + a )\n\n11 v 3 \u2212 v = (3u4 + 4u2 + 3)/(u2 + 1)2\n6\n\n3\n\n6\n\n13 v = 4u + 6\n19 v = 2u + 2\n3\n\n18\n\n4\n\n2\n\n2\n\n27 v \u2212 v = a (u + 1)/(u + 1)\nwhere a3 \u2212 a + 1 = 0\n\n31 v 3 = 5u6 \u2212 11u4 \u2212 11u2 + 5\n3\n\n6\n\n3\n\n6\n\n4\n\n2\n\n43 v = 7u + 8u + 8u + 7\n49 v = 2u + a\nwhere a2 \u2212 a + 3 = 0\n\nu 7\u2192 1/u\n\nu 7\u2192 \u2212u,\n\nu 7\u2192 1/u\n\nu 7\u2192 \u2212u,\nu 7\u2192 \u2212u,\n\nwhere a2 \u2212 a \u2212 1 = 0\n3\n\nu 7\u2192 \u2212u,\n\nu 7\u2192 2/u\nu 7\u2192 a/u\n\nu 7\u2192 \u2212u,\n\nu 7\u2192 1/u\n\nu 7\u2192 \u2212u,\n\nu 7\u2192 1/u\n\nu 7\u2192 \u2212u,\nu 7\u2192 \u2212u,\n\nu 7\u2192 2/u\nu 7\u2192 1/u\n\nu 7\u2192 \u2212u,\n\nu 7\u2192 1/u\n\nu 7\u2192 \u2212u,\n\nu 7\u2192 a3 /u\n\nu 7\u2192 \u2212u,\n\nu 7\u2192 1/u\n\nTable 5.

Examples of pointless genus-4 hyperelliptic curves over\nFq (with q even). On each line, the symbol t refers to an arbitrary\nelement of Fq whose trace to F2 is equal to 1.\n\nLet q be a power of 2. An easy argument shows that a genus-4 hyperelliptic curve\nover Fq provided with an action of the Klein group must have a rational Weierstrass\npoint, and so will not be pointless. Thus we decided simply to enumerate the genus4 hyperelliptic curves (with no rational Weierstrass points) over the remaining Fq\nand to check for pointless curves. We found pointless hyperelliptic curves over Fq\nfor q \u2208 {2, 4, 8, 16}; the examples we give in Table 6 are all twists over Fq of curves\nthat can be defined over F2 .\nOur computer search also revealed that every genus-4 hyperelliptic curve over\nF32 has at least one rational point. So to find an example of a pointless genus-4\ncurve over F32 , we decided to look for genus-4 double covers of elliptic curves E.\n\n\f14\n\nEVERETT W. HOWE, KRISTIN E. LAUTER, AND JAAP TOP\n\nOur heuristic suggested that we might have good luck finding pointless curves if E\nhad few points, but for the sake of completeness we examined every E over F32 .\nWe found that up to isomorphism and Galois conjugacy there are exactly two\npointless genus-4 curves over F32 that are double covers of elliptic curves. The first\ncan be defined by the equations\ny 2 + y = x + 1/x + 1\nz2 + z =\n\na7 x4 + a30 x3 y + a13 x2 + x + a23 xy + a6\nx3 + a15 x2 + x + a28\n\nand the second by\ny 2 + y = x + a7 /x\nz2 + z =\n\na4 x4 + a7 x3 y + a3 x3 + a23 x2 y + a28 x2 + a28 xy + a16\n,\nx3 + a25 x2 + a22 x + a25\n\nwhere a5 + a2 + 1 = 0.\nReferences\n[1] Roland Auer and Jaap Top: Some genus 3 curves with many points, pp. 163\u2013171 in\nAlgorithmic Number Theory (Claus Fieker and David R.
