As a result, the numerically determined synchronization threshold agree with the analytical\nresults previously obtained [C. Anteneodo et al., Phys. Rev. E. 68, 045202(R) (2003)] for this class\nof systems. We present both careful numerical experiments and a rigorous mathematical explanation\nconfirming this fact, allowing for a generalization involving hyperbolic coupled map lattices.\n\nThe possibility of synchronizing chaotic dynamics has\nbeen harnessed in a large number of systems of physical interest [1], like coupled Josephson junctions [2] and\nlasers [3]. Although there have been identified different\ntypes of chaos synchronization, we shall concentrate on\nthe so-called amplitude or complete synchronization, for\nwhich all dynamical variables undergo the same time evolution [4]. The essential dynamics involved in the process\nof chaos synchronization lies on the low-dimensionality of\nthe subspace (in the phase space of the system) in which\nsynchronized motion sets in.\nFor example, if we consider a lattice of N coupled oscillators, each of them represented by a vector field of D\ndimensions, where typically D \u226a N , the synchronized\nstate belongs to a D-dimensional subspace of the N Ddimensional phase space. In order for this synchronized\nstate to exist the coupling among oscillators takes on a\nsuitable form [5]. Whether or not this synchronized state\nis stable, however, is a more difficult question, since it involves the analysis of infinitesimal displacements from the\nsynchronized state along all (N \u22121)D directions transversal to the synchronization subspace [6]. The stability condition of the synchronized orbit with respect to transversal perturbations can be obtained from the negativeness\nof the largest transversal Lyapunov exponent.\nIn this letter we consider a coupled chaotic map lattice (CML) in which the coupling prescription is nonlocal, for it takes into account the distance between them\nalong the lattice. Such non-local couplings appear in\nmany problems of physical [7] and biological interest [8].\nWe suppose that the coupling strength decreases with\nthe lattice distance as a power-law, which characteristic exponent can take on any positive value [9]. The\nloss of transversal stability of the synchronized state, as\nthe coupling parameters are varied, was found in such\npower-law couplings, with help of the largest transversal\nLyapunov exponent, for a number of chaotic maps [10].\nIn the particular case of maps with constant eigenvalues\nof the Jacobian matrix (piecewise-linear chaotic maps)\nwe obtained analytical results for the loss of transversal\nstability of the synchronized state which agree with the\nnumerical simulations [11]. Such CML's represent hyperbolic dynamical systems, what enables us to use powerful\nmathematical tools like ergodicity and global shadowing\nof numerically generated orbits [12].\n\nOn the other hand, in a recent paper there was argued that in the special case of coupled non-smooth maps\nthe synchronization transition would not be given by the\nlargest transversal exponent, but rather by a different approach taking into account finite distances from the synchronized state [13]. To investigate this apparent contradiction we considered in this letter the transient behavior\nof the non-synchronized orbits for coupled piecewise linear maps. Our results show that the analytical results\nof Ref. [11] (using linear transversal stability of the synchronized state) hold for both smooth and non-smooth\nmaps, the numerical results being strongly affected by\nmany factors as the large transient time and the choice\nof initial conditions. Due to these factors, the time it\ntakes to achieve convergence to the synchronized state\nmay be extremely large, what may lead to wrong conclusions about the stationary state of the system. Motivated by this problem, we investigated the validity of\nthe transversal linear stability analysis in a class of hyperbolic CML's, using periodic-orbit theory to unveil the\nrole of the unstable orbits embedded in the synchronized\nstate [14, 15, 16].\nThe CML we consider in this work can be written in\nthe explicit form of a N -dimensional dynamical system\nxn+1 = (1 + C)F(xn ) \u2261 BF(xn ),\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n(1)\n(N ) T\n\nwhere the components of xn = (xn , xn , . . . , xn ) denote the state variable attached to the map located at\nthe site i = 1, . . . , N at time n = 0, 1, . . .. If the uncoupled maps are written as x 7\u2192 f (x) we can write\nT\nF(x) = [f (x(1) ), f (x(2) ), . . . , f (x(N ) )] . Moreover, the\ncoupling prescription is represented by the matrix C, and\n1 is the identity matrix.\nIn the following we consider the generalized Bernoulli\nmap f (x) = \u03b2x, (mod 1), where x \u2208 [0, 1) and \u03b2 > 1,\nsuch that the isolated map generates a strongly chaotic\norbit. When these piecewise-linear maps are coupled ac(i)\ncording to Eq. (1), in order to ensure that xn \u2208 [0, 1),\nthe elements B must satisfy the following necessary and\nP\nsufficient conditions: Bij \u2265 0, and 0 \u2264 N\nj=1 Bij \u2264 1, for\nall i, j = 1, 2, . . . N [17]. Moreover, we use a symmetric\ncoupling matrix with elements\n\u0003\n\u0002 \u2212\u03b1\n(2)\n(1 \u2212 \u03b4ij ) \u2212 \u03b7\u03b4ij ,\nCij = \u03b5\u03b7 \u22121 rij\n\n\f2\n\n0,3\n\nN = 129\n\n0,2\n\n0,1\n\n(c)\n\ns=0\n4\ns = 10\n\n0,4\n\nmax{\u03b5num}\nmin{\u03b5num}\n\nN = 257\n\n(d)\n\nN = 33\n\n(1 \u2264 k \u2264 N )\n\n(3)\n\n\u03b5num\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\nN\nX\n1\n2\u03c0km\n,\ncos\nm\u03b1\nN\nm=1\n\n0,4\n\n(b)\n\nw=4\nw=5\nw=6\n\n0,3\n\n\u2032\n\nb(k) =\n\n(a)\n\nN = 17\nN = 33\nN = 65\nN = 129\nN = 257\n\n\u03b5num\n\nwhere rij = minl\u2208Z |i \u2212 j + lN | is the minimum lattice\ndistance between the sites i and j (with periodic boundP \u2032 \u2212\u03b1\n, with N \u2032 = (N \u2212 1)/2,\nary conditions), \u03b7 = 2 N\n1 r\nand the coupling strength satisfies 0 \u2264 \u03b5 \u2264 1 due to the\nconstraints on Bij . The effective range of interactions is\nrepresented by \u03b1 \u2265 0 such that the limits \u03b1 = 0 and\n\u03b1 \u2192 \u221e correspond, respectively, to global (mean field)\nand local (first neighbors) coupling prescriptions.\nA completely synchronized state is the chaotic orbit\n(1)\n(N )\nfor which xn = . . . = xn , and which is a solution of\nEq. (1). Since the Jacobian DF = \u03b2B is a circulant\nmatrix, its eigenvalues can be analytically obtained as\n\u039b(k) = \u03b2[(1 \u2212 \u03b5) + (\u03b5/\u03b7)b(k\u22121) ], where\n\n0,2\nN\n\nsuch that the Lyapunov spectrum {\u03bbi }i=1 can be derived [11]. The stability threshold of the synchronized\nstate with respect to infinitesimal transversal displacements, obtained by imposing \u03bb2 = 0, gives two curves\nin the parameter plane (\u03b5 versus \u03b1): (i) \u03b5\u2032c (\u03b1, N ) =\nmin{\u03b5up (\u03b1, N ), 1}; and (ii) \u03b5c (\u03b1, N ) = min{\u03b5lo (\u03b1, N ), 1},\nwhere we defined\n\u2032\n\n\u03b5up (\u03b1, N ) = (1 + \u03b2 \u22121 )[1 \u2212 (b(N ) /\u03b7)]\n\u03b5lo (\u03b1, N ) = (1 \u2212 \u03b2 \u22121 )[1 \u2212 (b(1) /\u03b7)]\n\n\u22121\n\n\u22121\n\n.\n\n,\n\n(4)\n(5)\n\nIn order to check the validity of these analytical conditions for the threshold of transversal stability we have\nmade careful numerical experiments using the same criteria as proposed in Ref. [13] (where it has been claimed\nthat those conditions would hold only for coupled smooth\n(i)\nmaps). Accordingly, we choose initial conditions x0 uniformly distributed in the interval [0, 1) [19]. The CML\nis firstly iterated for a transient time of Tw = 10w \u00d7 N\ntimes and further iterated by more T = 103 \u00d7 N times.\nAs a numerical diagnostic of complete synchronization\nwe computed the following quantity\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nX 1\nX\n1\n\uf8f8 ,\n\uf8ed\nR=\nx(j)\nx(i)\n(6)\nn\nn \u2212\nN\nT\nN\nn,i\nj\nwhich is essentially a mean deviation from the latticeaveraged amplitude. The resulting dynamical state is\nconsidered as being completely synchronized if R < 10\u22128 .\nIn the coupling parameter space we keep \u03b1 constant and\nsweep through the values of \u03b5 \u2208 [0, 1]. The value corresponding to the synchronization threshold, denoted as\n\u03b5num , is obtained from bisection as \u03b5num = (\u03b5s + \u03b5d )/2,\nwhere \u03b5s and \u03b5d are, respectively, the last value corresponding to a synchronized state and the first value for\na non-synchronized one. The numerical value of \u03b5num is\nturned more accurate from refining the increment mesh\nand repeating the process, until (\u03b5s \u2212 \u03b5d ) \u2264 10\u22123 .\nThe results of this numerical procedure, for the case\n\u03b2 = 1.1, are depicted in Figure 1, where we show the\n\n0,1\n0\n\n0,2\n\n0,4\n\n\u03b1\n\n0,6\n\n0,8\n\n10\n\n0,2\n\n0,4\n\n\u03b1\n\n0,6\n\n0,8\n\n1\n\nFIG. 1: (color online) Values of the coupling strength at the\nonset of transversal stability loss of the synchronized state, as\na function of the effective coupling range. We used \u03b2 = 1.1\nand (a) different lattice sizes; (b) different transient times\nTw , for a fixed lattice size; (c) different distributions of initial\nconditions, for N = 257; (d) different initial conditions, for\nN = 33 and a fixed transient time. The solid lines represent\nthe analytical results from linear transversal stability of the\nsynchronized state.\n\nvalue of the coupling strength at the synchronization\nthreshold as a function of \u03b1. In Fig. 1(a) we show how\nthe numerically determined critical value increases with\n\u03b1 for different lattice sizes N , the transient time being\ndifferent for each choice, using w = 5. The solid lines\ncorrespond to the analytical condition derived in Ref.[11]\n(and that depend on the lattice size as well). In fact, as\nthe lattice size N increases, the numerical values of \u03b5num\nmay no longer match the analytically predicted values, if\n\u03b1 is large enough [13]. This does not mean, however, that\nthe analytical value of \u03b5c is not valid in those cases, but\nrather that the numerical simulations have not been performed using a transient long enough. To show the influence of the transient time in the results, we show in Fig.\n1(b) the dependence of \u03b5num with \u03b1 for a fixed lattice of\nN = 129 sites by changing the parameter w. By increasing the transient time the numerically obtained values\nfor the synchronization threshold agree better with those\nderived from transversal linear stability. The same conclusions were obtained using other lattice sizes as well.\nThese results suggest that the analytical result for \u03b5c remains valid, as long as we use sufficiently long transient\ntimes, in contrast with Ref. [13].\nAnother factor that affects the accuracy of numerical results for the threshold of synchronization is that\n\n\f3\na distribution of initial conditions over the interval [0, 1)\nshould respect the natural measure of the chaotic orbit.\nWhile for integer values of \u03b2 the natural measure is uniform, this is no longer valid for fractional \u03b2, and small\nerrors are introduced if we choose initial conditions with\na uniform probability distribution. In order to overcome\nthis problem we iterated each map s times before starting coupling them according to Eq. (1) (this transient\ntime should not be confused with the transient time Tw\nwe compute after having started coupling the maps). In\nFigure 1(c) we compare the results of two simulations:\nfor the line with filled triangles we used initial conditions\nuniformly distributed along [0, 1), without discarding any\ntransients (s = 0); whereas the line with open triangles\nwas obtained from initial conditions chosen with respect\nto a numerical approximation of the natural measure,\nthe latter having being obtained from a transient time of\ns = 104 iterations. The results obeying the natural measure are more likely to agree with the analytical results\nsince, after the synchronized state sets in, the corresponding orbit must follow this natural measure.\nNumerical results on the synchronization of coupled\ngeneralized Bernoulli maps depend also on the distribution of initial conditions on [0, 1). In order to analyze\nthe dependence of \u03b5num on the initial conditions, we performed extensive numerical simulations with an ensemble\nof 5000 identically prepared CML's, each of them with a\ndifferent initial condition [Fig. 1(d)] and the same transient time (w = 5). We observed different values of \u03b5num\nfor each initial condition, provided \u03b1 is large enough.\nInstead of showing each of them (what would turn the\nfigure too much loaded with symbols) we represented in\nFig. 1(d) only those numerical values of \u03b5num that are\nclosest (open circles) and farthest (filled circles) with respect to the analytical value (full line).\nIt is possible to understand, from a general point of\nview, the causes of the strong dependence of the synchronization threshold results on the transient time and the\ninitial conditions. These causes are not restricted to coupled piecewise-linear maps as ours, but are rather generic\nfor hyperbolic CML's [20]. We can extend our conclusions to a CML given by Eq. (1) where the coupling preN\nscription keeps invariant the phase space \u03a9 = [0, 1) , and\n(1)\n(N )\nfor which S = {x = * * * = x } is the one-dimensional\ninvariant synchronization manifold defined by the corresponding state. We consider a \u2206-neighborhood of S as\nthe set of points whose distances from the S do not exceed \u2206: \u03a3\u2206 = {x : d(x, S) \u2264 \u2206}, where d is a suitably defined distance on the metric space \u03a9. We define\n\u03a3 \u2261 lim\u2206\u21920 \u03a3\u2206 as a linear neighborhood of S. Accordingly \u0393 = \u03a9 \u2212 \u03a3 is the phase space region, except the\nlinear neighborhood of the synchronization manifold.\nWe can speak of the global dynamics generated by the\ncoupled map lattice xn+1 = BF(xn ) in terms of their periodic points. In this spirit we denote xj (p) the jth fixed\npoint of the p-times iterated vector function BF(xn ).\nThe ith eigenvalue of the Jacobian matrix of BF[p] (xn ),\nevaluated at this point, is written as \u039bi (xj (p)), such that\n\n|\u039b1 (xj (p))| \u2265 * * * \u2265 |\u039bN (xj (p))|.\nLet us consider a subset of the phase space, A \u2286 \u03a9,\nwith natural measure \u03bc(A). Note that, by construction,\nwe have \u03bc(\u03a9) = 1. For hyperbolic systems satisfying the\nAxiom-A [21] the natural measure of such subset can be\nobtained from the unstable periodic points embedded in\nit as [14]\n\u03bc(A) = lim\n\np\u2192\u221e\n\nX\n\n1/Lj (p),\n\n(7)\n\nQdu\n|\u039bi (xj (p))| (du is the largest intewhere Lj (p) = i=1\nger such that |\u039bdu (xj (p))| > 1) and the sum sweeps over\nall xj (p) \u2208 A. The exploitation of this identity is the\nobject of periodic-orbit theory, that has been used for\na number of theoretical investigations on the properties\nof chaotic dynamical systems [15, 16]. For generalized\nBernoulli maps \u03b2x (mod 1) and a linear coupling, the\nJacobian matrix has constant entries and thus do not\ndepend on the orbit points, i.e. all the unstable periodic orbits have the same eigenvalue spectra (consequently Lj (p) = L(p) for all j), and the natural measure\nis \u03bc(A) = limp\u2192\u221e NA (p)/L(p), where NA (p) is the number of period-p points contained in the subset A of \u03a9.\nA byproduct of the periodic-orbit theory is that the\n(linear) transversal stability of the synchronization manifold can be studied either from the natural measure of\na typical chaotic orbit (by the second largest Lyapunov\nexponent) or from the atypical measure generated by the\nunstable periodic orbits. In particular, with respect to\nthe period-p orbit the threshold of transversal stability of\nthe synchronization manifold can be obtained from the\ncondition |\u039b2 (xj (p))| = 1 for all xj (p) \u2208 S. As the period\np goes to infinity we expect an increasingly better agreement of this result with that obtained by using the second\nlargest transversal Lyapunov exponent (or \u03bb2 = 0). For\na given \u03b1 and values of the coupling strengths such that\n\u03b5lo (\u03b1) < \u03b5 < \u03b5up (\u03b1), that the natural measure of the\nsubset A is\n\u03bc(A) = lim NA (p)/\u03b2 p .\np\u2192\u221e\n\n(8)\n\nTaking A to be the linear neighborhood of the synchronization manifold, \u03a3, there follows that the number\nof orbits in this neighborhood is N\u03a3 = \u03b2 p \u2212 1 for integer\n\u03b2 (if \u03b2 is fractional, as in the numerical simulations of\nthe previous section, one has to take the integer part of\nthis expression) and the corresponding natural measure\nis given by\n\u03bc(\u03a3) = lim (\u03b2 p \u2212 1)\u03b2 \u2212p = 1,\np\u2192\u221e\n\n(9)\n\ndemonstrating that the linear neighborhood of the synchronization manifold S is the asymptotic state of any\ntypical initial condition (in the sense that the set of initial\nconditions that do not converge to \u03a3 has zero Lebesgue\nmeasure). An immediate consequence of this result is\nthat the natural measure outside the linear neighborhood\n\n\f4\nis zero since, using the fact that the natural measure is\nergodic, we have \u03bc(\u0393) = \u03bc(\u03a9) \u2212 \u03bc(\u03a3) = 0.\nGiven that almost all initial conditions outside the synchronization manifold eventually asymptote to it, we may\nwell ask why sometimes it takes so long for this convergence to be observed in numerical experiments. As we\nsaw in the previous section, this long transient time may\neven be mistaken as a effect of non-convergence. The answer lies in the properties of the horseshoe-like invariant\nchaotic set embedded in \u0393. This set is non-attracting\nsince almost all initial conditions in \u0393 converge to S as\nthe time goes to infinity.\nHowever, the measure generated by chaotic orbits\nwhose initial conditions are uniformly distributed over\nof an open region B of the phase space \u03a9 decays exponentially with time with escape rate \u03b3, according to\nX\n1/Lj (p),\n(10)\nlim e\u2212\u03b3t = lim\nt\u2192\u221e\n\np\u2192\u221e\n\nxj (p)\u2208B\n\nwhere in the sum we consider only the periodic orbits\nof the horseshoe-like set B outside the synchronization\nmanifold [14]. Hence, if one picks up at random an initial\ncondition off the synchronization manifold, the distribution of the transient times is likely to be exponential,\n\n[1] A. Pikovsky, M. Rosemblum, and J.

If the initial condition is too close to an invariant manifold of an unstable periodic orbit of B it would\nstick to the manifold for some time-span and hence it\ntakes a very long time for such a trajectory to approach\nthe synchronization manifold. This seems to occur very\noften if we use fractional values of \u03b2, like in the numerical\nsimulations we shown in this letter.\nIn conclusion, the analytical conditions for the threshold of transversal stability of the synchronized state of\ncoupled piecewise-linear maps are confirmed by numerical experiments as long as we observe the following precautions: (i) the transient time should be chosen as large\nas possible, (ii) the choice of initial conditions should be\ndone using a probability distribution which best matches\nthe natural measure of the distribution.\nAlthough these computational problems are less likely\nto occur in coupled smooth maps, they do not invalidate\nthe analytical approach to the transversal stability of\ncoupled non-smooth maps, like piecewise-linear ones. We\nhave used general arguments valid for hyperbolic CML's\nso as to prove that the transversal stability of the synchronized state actually implies the synchronization of\nall typical orbits.\n\n[16] R.

For coupled generalized Bernoulli\nmaps the set \u03a9 is the N-torus [0, 1)N and the Jacobian\nmatrix DF has constant entries and does not depend on\nx \u2208 \u03a9, thus the dimension of the invariant subspaces is\nconstant everywhere [condition (i)]. Thanks to this particular form of the Jacobian its eigenvectors (which span\nthe invariant subspaces) are everywhere orthogonal [condition (ii)]. Let u be any of such eigenvectors: under the\ndynamics of F it follows that u is mapped to a vector\nalong the same direction [condition (iii)]. Hence the set\n\u03a9 is hyperbolic.\n[21] A hyperbolic system satisfying Axiom-A must be mixing.\nThis condition is fulfilled if the system possesses a dense\nset of unstable periodic orbits embedded in the chaotic\norbit [12].\n\n\f"}
