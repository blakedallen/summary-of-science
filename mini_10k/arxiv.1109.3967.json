The study of intracluster light (ICL) can help us to understand the mechanisms taking place in galaxy clusters, and\nto place constraints on the cluster formation history and physical properties. However, owing to the intrinsic faintness of ICL\nemission, most searches and detailed studies of ICL have been limited to redshifts z< 0.4.\nAims. To help us extend our knowledge of ICL properties to higher redshifts and study the evolution of ICL with redshift, we\nsearch for ICL in a subsample of ten clusters detected by the ESO Distant Cluster Survey (EDisCS), at redshifts 0.4 <z< 0.8,\nthat are also part of our DAFT/FADA Survey.\nMethods. We analyze the ICL by applying the OV WAV package, a wavelet-based technique, to deep HST ACS images in the\nF814W filter and to V-band VLT/FORS2 images of three clusters. Detection levels are assessed as a function of the diffuse light\nsource surface brightness using simulations.\nResults. In the F814W filter images, we detect diffuse light sources in all the clusters, with typical sizes of a few tens of kpc\n(assuming that they are at the cluster redshifts). The ICL detected by stacking the ten F814W images shows an 8\u03c3 detection in\nthe source center extending over a \u223c 50 \u00d7 50 kpc2 area, with a total absolute magnitude of \u221221.6 in the F814W filter, equivalent\nto about two L\u2217 galaxies per cluster. We find a weak correlation between the total F814W absolute magnitude of the ICL and\nthe cluster velocity dispersion and mass. There is no apparent correlation between the cluster mass-to-light ratio (M/L) and\nthe amount of ICL, and no evidence for any preferential orientation in the ICL source distribution. We find no strong variation\nin the amount of ICL between z=0 and z=0.8. In addition, we find wavelet-detected compact objects (WDCOs) in the three\nclusters for which data in two bands are available; these objects are probably very faint compact galaxies that in some cases\nare members of the respective clusters and comparable to the faint dwarf galaxies of the Local Group.\nConclusions. We have shown that ICL is important in clusters at least up to redshift z=0.8. The next step is now to detect it\nat even larger redshifts, to see if there is a privileged stage of cluster evolution where it has been stripped from galaxies and\nspread in the intracluster medium.\nKey words. galaxies: clusters\n\n\f1. Introduction\nThe search for intracluster light (hereafter ICL) provides\na complementary way of determining the mechanisms occurring inside galaxy clusters, as well as constraining the\nproperties and formation history of the ICL. These studies promise to yield possible answers to many fundamental questions about the formation and evolution of galaxy\nclusters and their constituent galaxies. In addition, it is\nimportant to determine how and when the ICL formed,\nand the connection between the ICL and the central\nbrightest cluster galaxy (see e.g. Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2005).\nCosmological N-body and hydrodynamical simulations are\nbeginning to predict the kinematics and origin of the ICL\n(see e.g. Dolag et al. 2010). The ICL traces the evolution of baryonic substructures in dense environments and\ncan thus be used to constrain some aspects of cosmological simulations that are uncertain, such as the modeling\nof star formation and the mass distribution of the baryonic light-emitting component in galaxies. The study by\nDa Rocha et al. (2005) also produced important results\nabout the significant presence of ICL in groups, which are\ncrucial if we assume that groups are the basic building\nblocks of clusters, that are able to bring their own ICL to\nthe cluster-building process.\nFrom a technical point-of-view, modern CCD cameras\nnow allow us to study the properties of the diffuse light in\nclusters, i.e. its morphology, radial distribution, and colors, in a quantitative way (e.g. Uson et al. 1991, Bernstein\net al. 1995, Gregg & West 1998, Mihos et al. 2005, Zibetti\net al. 2005, Gonz\u00e1lez et al. 2007, Krick & Bernstein 2007,\nRudick et al. 2010). However, accurate photometric measurements of the diffuse light are difficult to perform because its surface brightness is typically fainter than 1% of\nthat of the night sky, and it can be difficult (especially\nat high redshift) to distinguish the extended outer halos\nof the brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) in a cluster core\nfrom the stars floating freely in the cluster potential, i.e.\nthe intracluster light component. Moreover, the dimming\nfactor plays an important role in our study and makes it\nintrinsically difficult to detect ICL at high redshift. This\ncosmological surface-brightness dimming, which follows a\n(1 + z)4 law, places de facto an upper limit on the redshift\n\nSend\noffprint\nrequests\nto:\nL.\nGuennou\ne-mail:\nloic.guennou@oamp.fr\n\u22c6\nBased on observations made at ESO Telescopes at the\nParanal Observatory under programme ID 082.A-0374. Also\nbased on the use of the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database\n(NED) which is operated by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory,\nCalifornia Institute of Technology, under contract with the\nNational Aeronautics and Space Administration. Based on observations made with the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope,\nobtained from the data archives at the Space Telescope\nEuropean Coordinating Facility and the Space Telescope\nScience Institute, which is operated by the Association of\nUniversities for Research in Astronomy, Inc., under NASA contract NAS 5-26555.\n\nto which the ICL can be practically studied, that depends\non the image depth and the detection methods.\nThis explains why, until now, most studies of the ICL\nhave been performed on galaxy clusters at redshifts below\nz\u223c0.3 (see e.g. Toledo et al. 2011). However, since it is\ncrucial to understand how the evolution of galaxy clusters\naffects that of the ICL, we must study the ICL within a\nrange of clusters at various redshifts. It would be ideal to\ninvestigate as much as possible the period between z=0.3\nand z\u223c2, and investigate clusters since their birth. We\npropose here to fill part of this gap in the 0.4-0.8 redshift\nrange for a sample of ten clusters. This redshift range is\nsufficient to cover about half of the typical cluster lifetimes. To help us follow the cluster formation history, we\nalso compare our ICL results in terms of cluster prefered\norientations obtained here with those obtained with the\nSerna & Gerbal (1996) dynamical method.\nColors are useful for determining the evolution of\ngalaxy clusters, and we have been able to detect the ICL in\ntwo bands (the HST/ACS F814W-band and the groundbased VLT/FORS2 V-band) for the three lowest redshift\nclusters. In summary, we studied the diffuse light in ten\ndifferent clusters in one band up to z\u223c0.8 based on deep\nHST ACS images and in three of them (up to z\u223c0.58) in\ntwo bands with FORS2 data. However, these deep data\nwould not have been sufficient if we were not using a very\nsensitive wavelet-detection technique, the ov wav method\n(Pereira 2003 and Da Rocha et al. 2005), itself a variant\nof the \u00e0 trous wavelet transform described by Starck et al.\n(1998, see also Starck et al. 2002). This method is independent of both the galaxy and star modelling, and of the\nsky level subtraction.\nIn Sect. 2, we describe the sample and observational\ndata. In Sect. 3, we present the data analysis methods and\ndetection efficiency estimates. In Sect. 4, we present our\nanalysis for the F814W images. In Sect. 5, we discuss the\nnature of our detections, taking advantage of our V-band\ndata. Finally, the main results are summarized in Sect. 6.\nThroughout the paper, we assume that H0 = 71 km s\u22121\nMpc\u22121 , \u03a9m =0.27, and \u03a9\u039b =0.73. All magnitudes are in\nthe AB system.\n\n2. Sample and observational data\n2.1. The cluster sample\nOur study is focused on ten clusters from the Las\nCampanas Distant Cluster Survey (hereafter LCDCS:\nGonz\u00e1lez et al. 2001) observed in the HST/ACS F814Wband, and for three of these ten clusters also in the\nVLT/FORS2 V-band. The LCDCS sample consists of optically selected clusters in the z=[0.3, 1] range identified\nfrom fluctuations in the extragalactic background light.\nThe LCDCS was a drift-scan imaging survey of a 130 deg2\nstrip of the southern sky. Selection criteria for the LCDCS\nsurvey are fully automated so it constitutes a well-defined\nhomogeneous sample that can be used to address issues\nof cluster evolution and cosmology. Several studies have\n\n\fGuennou et al.: Intracluster light in 0.4<z<0.8 clusters\n\nalready been performed for these individual clusters (e.g.\nHalliday et al. 2004 and Milvang-Jensen et al. 2008).\nThe ten considered clusters are also part of the\nDAFT/FADA Survey, which consists of 91 distant clusters ranging from z=0.4 to z=0.9 and for which we have\nimages in several bands 1 .\nThese ten clusters were chosen because of the very\ndeep HST/ACS F814W data available (prop. 9476, PI:\nJ. Dalcanton), especially in a central \u223c 2 \u00d7 2 arcmin2 area\n(see next section). We present in Table 1 the basic characteristics of these ten clusters, including the redshift, velocity dispersion, and mass-to-light ratio (M/L) from Clowe\net al. (2006), and the total ICL F814W absolute magnitude.\n\n2.2. Observational data\n2.2.1. HST ACS data\nWe have at our disposal HST ACS F814W data, each image including 4 tiles (2\u00d72 mosaic) of 2 ks and a central tile\nof 8 ks (Desai et al. 2007). The depth achieved for point\nsources at the 90% level is of the order of 28 magnitude for\nthe deep parts and 26 magnitude for the shallow parts in\nF814W (see Guennou et al. 2010). These values are only\nestimates of the true completeness levels as the simulated\nobjects do not perfectly reproduce the full range of real\nobject profiles. In addition to the different exposure times,\nthe different thresholds used in SExtractor for the shallow\nand deep regions also explain the two magnitude difference\nbetween the two completeness levels2 . The full data reduction technique is described in Schrabback et al. (2010) but\nhere we describe the salient points. The data were reduced\nusing a modified version of the HAGGLeS pipeline, with\ncareful background subtraction, improved bad pixel masking, and a proper image registration. Stacking and cosmic\nray rejection were done with Multidrizzle (Koekemoer et\nal. 2002), taking the time-dependent field-distortion model\nfrom Anderson (2007) into account. The pixel scale was\n0.05 arcsec and we used a Lanczos3 kernel. After aligning the exposures of each tile separately, we determined\nthe shifts and rotations between the tiles from separate\nstacks by measuring the positions of objects in the overlap regions. As a final step, we created mosaic stacks by\nincluding all tiles for a given cluster.\n\n2.2.2. FORS2 V-band data\nFORS2 is a multi-mode (including an imaging-mode) optical instrument mounted on the ESO VLT/UT1 Cassegrain\nfocus. The considered images had 0.25 arcsec pixels, covering a 6.8\u00d76.8 arcmin2 field of view. Guennou et al. (2010)\nshowed that the V-band images we selected were basically\n1\n\n(see http://cencos.oamp.fr/DAFT/ and Guennou et al.\n2010 for details)\n2\nThis is based on total magnitudes and an analysis performed at the 1.8\u03c3 and 3\u03c3 SExtractor levels, respectively, for\nthe deep and shallow parts to limit fake object detections.\n\n3\n\ncomplete down to F814W\u223c26 for point sources. We refer\nthe reader to White et al. (2005) for further details about\nthe observations.\n\n3. Methods\n3.1. Wavelet analysis\nDeep images are not always sufficient to detect ICL in distant clusters because of the dimming factor. We therefore\napplied the very sensitive ov wav package (see e.g. Pereira\n2003 and Da Rocha & Mendes de Oliveira 2005) to HST\nF814W images and FORS2 V-band images. The method\nis a multi-scale vision model (e.g. Ru\u00e9 and Bijaoui 1997),\nand we now describe its main steps. After applying the\nwavelet transform (i.e. the \u00e0 trous algorithm) to a given\n\"sky image\" (direct observation of the targeted cluster) a\nthresholding in the wavelet transform space is performed\nto identify the statistically significant pixels. These are\ngrouped in connected fields by a scale by scale segmentation procedure, in order to define the object structures. An\ninter-scale connectivity tree is then established and the object identification procedure extracts each connected tree\nthat contains connected fields of significant pixels across\nthree or more scales and, by referring to the object definition, can be associated with the objects. Finally, an\nindividual image can be recovered for each identified object, by applying an iterative reconstruction algorithm to\nthe data contained in the corresponding tree. Both measurement and classification operations can then be carried\nout.\nSince the images were by far too wide (8k\u00d78k) for the\ncode to operate efficiently, we divided the total area to be\nanalyzed into five subareas (see below).\nIn a first step, we detected high frequency objects in a\ntwo pass process. These objects were first detected in the\nsky image to produce our first object image. We used characteristic scales between 1 and 1024 pixels in the wavelet\nspace. The first object image was then subtracted from\nthe sky image to produce the first residual image. This\nfirst residual image therefore still includes objects larger\nthan 1024 pixels (51.2 arcsec diameter) as well as several\nsmaller previously hidden features. These hidden features\nare typically objects too faint to satisfy the wavelet first\npass thresholding conditions described in the following.\nWe then detected objects in this residual image, with\ncharacteristic scales between 1 and 128 pixels, to create\na second object image still including objects larger than\n128 pixels (6.4 arcsec diameter) as well as several smaller\npreviously hidden features. This second object image was\nthen subtracted from the original sky image to produce a\nsecond residual image. The main parameter for the object\ndetection in the wavelet method was a significance level\nof at least 5\u03c3 for each of the two passes.\nAt this point, most of the major compact objects have\nbeen removed from the second residual image. Small scale\n(radius smaller than 3.2 arcsec) bright diffuse light sources\nalso have been removed. At z\u223c0.6, this means that plume-\n\n\f4\n\nGuennou et al.: Intracluster light in 0.4<z<0.8 clusters\n\nTable 1.

In a similar way as in Adami et al. (2005), the third\npass involves a search for what we will call the real ICL\nsources, i.e. the most extended surface brightness features\nin the second residual images. These features were detected by considering pixels where the signal was larger\nthan 2.5\u03c3 (for each of the clusters), compared to an empty\narea of the residual image. Each of these sources was visually inspected before the removal of obvious residuals\nof bright saturated Galactic stars or defects due to image\ncosmetics (for example areas of low signal-to-noise ratio).\nBy definition, ICL sources do not include star residuals.\nWe show in Fig. 1 the results for the central area of\nLCDCS 0541. Objects detected in the first two passes are\nall compact and are similar to classical galaxies or stars. A\nlarge part of them also are detected by a SExtractor analysis, with the exception of several very faint objects that we\nwill later discuss and refer to as \"wavelet detected compact\nobjects\" (hereafter WDCOs). These WDCOs are waveletdetected (during the two first passes) objects which would\nnot have been detected by SExtractor.\nObjects detected in the third pass are several tens of\nkpc wide; they are not compact objects such as galaxies,\nbut are what we refer to as real ICL sources.\nFig. 1. 1.1\u00d71.1 arcmin2 images of the various steps of the\nwavelet analysis for LCDCS 0541. Upper left: sky image,\nupper right: first pass objects, lower left: second pass objects, lower right: final residual image.\n\n3.2. Detection efficiency\nBefore attempting any analysis of our detections, a crucial step is to assess the detection levels of our method\nas a function of the surface brightness of the diffuse light\nsources.

To\nachieve this, we employed a classical method where artificial sources are introduced into real images and then\ndetected with our codes. The same method was applied\nfor example in Adami et al. (2006) to estimate the detection levels of low surface brightness galaxies in the Coma\ncluster. Since both HST ACS and FORS2 V-band exposure times and observing conditions were similar for all\nthe considered clusters (see e.g. Guennou et al. 2010), we\narbitrarily selected the LCDCS 0541 cluster F814W and\nV images to perform our tests.\nAs a model of diffuse light sources, we chose a uniform disk with a radius of 25 pixels that we scaled to\ndifferent surface brightnesses. These 25 pixels correspond\nto a \u223c20 kpc wide object at z\u223c0.8, which is typical of\nmajor-galaxy sizes. It is an intermediate size between the\nWDCOs and the real ICL sources. The predicted detection\nlevels will therefore be intermediate between the WDCOs\nand the true detection rates of the ICL sources. Surface\nbrightnesses were chosen in successive 0.5 mag wide bins\nbetween F814W = 21.5 and 28.5 mag/arcsec2. We used\nvarious V-F814W colors to include these objects in the\nV-band images, namely V-F814W=1., 2.1, and 2.6. These\nvalues are typical of very blue, blue, and red objects (see\nFig. 2).\nFor each magnitude bin, we repeated the exercise ten\ntimes to compute a mean detection rate. We were unable\nto repeat this 100 times as in Adami et al. (2006) because the wavelet detection algorithm would have required\na prohibitively long computing time. The whole process\nwas performed in various places in both the deep (10 ks)\nand the wide (2 ks) HST ACS image areas. In Fig. 2,\nwe display our results and compare them with the detection levels achieved using a classical SExtractor detection\n(Bertin & Arnouts 1996, with a 1.8\u03c3 detection threshold\nand a minimum significant area of 4 pixels) instead of the\nwavelet technique.\nWe clearly see that SExtractor detections are basically impossible for objects fainter than F814W\u223c24\nmag/arcsec2, even when considering the deepest parts of\nthe HST ACS images. The use of the wavelet technique al-\n\n\fGuennou et al.: Intracluster light in 0.4<z<0.8 clusters\n\n5\n\nFig. 3.

We selected the\nbrightest diffuse light source detected in Coma (source 3 of\nAdami et al 2005) and estimated its F814W surface brightness by using the colors given in Fukugita et al. (1995) and\napplying (1+z)4 cosmological dimming. This source is very\nsimilar to the ICL sources listed in Table 1, with a diameter of \u223c60 kpc, no significantly peaked surface brightness profile, and a mean surface brightness of RV ega \u223c25\nat z=0.023.

Blue ellipses show the classical SExtractor-detected objects (not visible since they\nare removed by the first two wavelet passes). The image is\n1.6\u00d71.6 arcmin2 wide. Lower panel: same as before using\nonly the 1 orbit exposures. This image is zoomed on the\ncentral ICL source. The first white contour is at the 1.5\u03c3\nlevel.\n\nz=0.4 and z=0.8 (extreme redshift values of our cluster\nsample) are shown in Fig. 2 as the two vertical lines.\nHowever, we must keep in mind that these vertical lines\nare valid for very extended ICL sources while the detection\nlevels shown in Fig. 2 are for smaller (25 arcsec radius) objects. It appears that the shallow parts of the HST ACS\nimages are insufficiently deep to allow diffuse light source\ndetections for a large part of our cluster sample, even when\nusing the wavelet detection technique. We therefore consider only the deepest parts of the HST ACS images.\nFor the FORS2 V-band images, Fig. 2 shows that we\ncan only expect to detect blue to very blue objects and\nnot at redshifts significantly higher than 0.4. We therefore\nchose to consider only the three clusters in the sample at\nz\u22640.58 to attempt the detection of diffuse light sources\n(WDCOs) in the V-band.\nFinally, we verified our ability to recover the true surface brightness value after applying the wavelet detection\nprocess. Fig. 3 shows the mean error in the surface brightness estimate as a function of surface brightness. This\nerror was calculated to be the mean difference between\nthe chosen surface brightness of the artificial diffuse light\nsources and the measured one. We see that our estimated\nuncertainty is smaller than 0.25 magnitudes over the entire magnitude range considered. This value is taken to be\nthe typical magnitude uncertainty in the following.\n\n\f6\n\nGuennou et al.: Intracluster light in 0.4<z<0.8 clusters\n\n4. F814W diffuse light detections\n4.1. Stacked images\n\nFig. 5. Stacked F814W HST ACS second residual images\nof all ten considered clusters (upper figure), of the z\u22640.65\nclusters (middle figure: 5 clusters taken into account), and\nof the z\u22650.70 clusters (lower figure: 5 clusters taken into\naccount). Images are 200\u00d7200 kpc2 wide. The upper figure also shows as red circles the positions of the brightest\ncluster galaxies of the stacked clusters.\n\nThe first two passes of the wavelet process essentially provide detections of faint compact objects, the WDCOs.\nThese objects are not diffuse light sources but rather compact galaxies (or stars) that were too faint to be detected\nby SExtractor. In Sect. 5.2, we discuss the WDCOs that\nwere detected in both the F814W and the V-band images.\nHere, we concentrate on the third pass objects, which\nare much larger in size and represent the real ICL sources.\nThese objects are very similar to those detected in Coma\n(Adami et al. 2005) and A2667 (Covone et al. 2006a), and\nextend over several tens of kpc. In Fig. 4, we show examples of these objects detected at the 3\u03c3 level at the\nLCDCS 0541 center. None of these objects (when obvious residuals from bright saturated Galactic stars are removed) can be stars.\nTo establish whether all of the detected large-scale diffuse light sources are located at the cluster centers, we applied a stacking technique similar to the one employed by\nZibetti et al. (2005). We rescaled all the second residual\nimages in units of kpc and added them together using the\nEDISCS cluster centers as reference nodes. Results are\nshown in Fig. 5.\nThese diffuse light sources have typical sizes of a few\ntens of kpc. This implicitly assumes that the detected diffuse light sources are at the cluster redshifts, a hypothesis\nwhich does not seem unreasonable given the characteristics of these sources. Fig. 5 shows a very clear 8\u03c3 detection\n(at the source center) extending over a \u223c 50\u00d750 kpc2 area.\nThe total absolute magnitude of this source is \u221221.6 in the\nF814W filter, which is equivalent to about two L\u2217 galaxies for each of the ten clusters (assuming the L\u2217 values of\nIlbert et al. 2006).\nTotal absolute magnitudes were measured first evaluating the apparent magnitude of the diffuse light sources.\nThis was done by measuring the total flux in the second\nresidual image inside a circle immediately surrounding\nthe considered source (limited by the 2.5\u03c3 external coutour, typically slightly more than 200 pixels). Background\nwas estimated in a of 10 pixel (5 arcsec) wide concentric\nannulus surrounding the measurement circle and starting\n50 pixels after the measurement circle radius. Star residuals were not included in the computation in this annulus.\nThen, as previously, we assumed the diffuse light\nsource to be part of the considered cluster in order to\ncompute a distance modulus with the adopted cosmology.\nFinally, we k-corrected the computed absolute magnitudes\nwith the values listed in Section 4.5., assuming ellipticallike colors.\nFig. 5 also shows the brightest cluster galaxies of the\nstacked clusters. This allows us to see that the detected\ndiffuse light sources are most of the time close to these\ngalaxies, but not always centered on these positions.\nWe divided our sample into low and high redshift clusters and produced two stacked residual images for clus-\n\n\fGuennou et al.: Intracluster light in 0.4<z<0.8 clusters\n\nters at z\u22640.65 and z\u22650.70. This permitted 6\u03c3 and 8\u03c3 detections in both redshift bins (see Fig. 5). The absolute\nmagnitudes of the diffuse light sources detected at z\u22640.65\nand z\u22650.70 (\u221220.9 and \u221221.3, respectively, in the F814W\nfilter) correspond to about two L\u2217 galaxies for each of\nthe individual clusters. It is not easy, however, to express\nthe amount of ICL as a percentage of the total cluster\nlight, because it requires a measurement of the total cluster light. In the considered redshift range, we were only\nable to use photometric redshifts to define cluster membership, and the relatively large photometric redshift uncertainties (\u00b10.1: see Guennou et al. 2010) would have in\nturn created too large an uncertainty on the measurement\nof the total cluster light.\nWe note that in the LCDCS detection technique the\nclusters are detected as positive surface brightness fluctuations in the background sky. If the amount of diffuse light\ndetected was greater than the galaxy contribution, then\nthe detection method would preferentially identify clusters\nwith a large amount of diffuse light. Given the moderate\namount of diffuse light, this bias, even if present, should\nnot have a strong effect.\n\n4.2. Superflat residuals?\nIn this subsection, we check by two ways that our ICL\ndetections are not artefacts due to the numerical image\nreduction. Superflat defaults may produce such sources.\nA good method to check this is to try to redetect our\nICL sources in HST F814W ACS images where they physically lie in different CCD regions. This would be possible\nby using only the external 1 orbit tiles in order to generate\nthe central image. This means that we would exclude the\ncentral 4 orbits tile and that the area where the ICL source\nis present will not be affected in the same way by the possible numerical artefacts. The problem is that we showed\nthat 1 orbit images are not deep enough to efficiently detect ICL sources in the most distant of our clusters. We\ntherefore only selected LCDCS 0541, which is one of the\nclosest structures in our sample (z=0.54) and the structure with the second brightest detected ICL source. We\nanalyzed for this cluster the 1 orbit images in the same\nway as the full depth image. We show the result in Fig. 4.\nWe redetect the ICL source, as expected at a lower signal to noise of 1.5. The magnitude of this source is \u221219.6,\nfainter than the \u221220.4 value predicted by the full depth\nimage. This is not surprising since we do not detect the\nexternal part of the ICL source with images taken during\nonly one orbit.\nAnother test is to search for diffuse light in places\nwhere it is not supposed to be present. For this, we selected all the central areas (1000\u00d71000 pixels) of the external 1 orbit tiles. These areas only cover the cluster outskirts where we did not detect any significant ICL sources.\nWe then added together these images disregarding their\nastrometry and produced in this way a very deep fake\nimage supposed to be free of ICL sources. This image is\n\n7\n\nmade of forty 1 orbit tiles and provides an image quality\nsimilar to that of the full depth central images. Analyzing\nthis fake field in the same way as previously, we produced\na residual map which shows nearly no significant ICL\nsource (see Fig. 6). Numerical artefacts therefore do not\nseem to be a problem in our analysis.\nFig. 6. Fake image built with the forty external 1 orbit\ntiles. We only show the area of 1000\u00d71000 pixel2 . Red\ncontours correspond to levels starting at 2.5\u03c3 and increasing by 0.5\u03c3. The large black square represents the typical\nsize of ICL sources detected in real images. The black circle is the only diffuse light source detected in this fake\nimage which is not a star residual.\n\n4.3. Anisotropic ICL distribution?\nThe stacked images presented in the previous section were\nobtained by assuming random orientations of the clusters. The images of the ICL were therefore, by definition,\nisotropic. To determine whether any preferential orientation could be identified in the spatial distribution of the\nICL, we chose to rely on another measurement of the orientation, based on the substructures potentially populating the clusters (we could also have relied on the brightest cluster galaxy orientation but the goal of the present\npaper is not a detailed study of these galaxy characteristics). As shown in several studies (e.g. Adami et al. 2009),\nthese substructures are good indicators of the directions in\nwhich matter is being accreted from the cosmic web, and\nwhen they are detected they appear as special orientations\nof the clusters.\nWe therefore analyzed the inner structure of the ten\nclusters using the Serna-Gerbal method (Serna & Gerbal,\n1996), which allows us to both find and study substructures in galaxy clusters based on dynamical arguments.\nThis method adopts a hierarchical clustering analysis to\ndetermine the relationship between galaxies based on their\nrelative binding energies (see Serna & Gerbal 1996 for\na complete description of the method). To determine\nwhether a given galaxy is part of a given cluster substructure or not, we need to know its projected position,\nits magnitude, and its spectroscopic redshift (see Table 1\nfor the number of such available redshifts along the considered lines of sight). We considered only substructures\ncontaining at least three galaxies and within a redshift\ninterval of \u00b10.012 from the cluster redshift (this is \u00b13\ntimes the maximal velocity dispersion for a cluster). For\ntwo of the ten clusters, no substructures were detected.\nThis does not mean that these clusters are fully relaxed:\nit is possible that our spectroscopic sampling was insufficient to detect potential substructures. For eight clusters,\nsignificant substructures were detected and we show their\nspatial distributions in Fig. 7.\n\n\f8\n\nGuennou et al.: Intracluster light in 0.4<z<0.8 clusters\n\nThe comparison of these subtructures with the study\nof Halliday et al. (2004) (based on the Dressler-Shectman\ntest) is not straightforward. However, limiting our analysis to the clusters in common, we note that clusters\nwith no subtructures detected with the Serna & Gerbal\nmethod are found to have no significant substructure\nin the Dressler-Shectman test. Conversely, all clusters\nfor which substructures are detected with the DresslerShectman test also exhibit subtructures according to the\nSerna & Gerbal method.\nTo help identify any cluster orientations, we computed\nhistograms of the angular positions of the galaxies found\nto be part of substructures in the cluster (see Fig. 8).\nWe also tried to infer the orientations directly from the\nICL emission. However, these sources are quite faint and\nany orientation estimate has a very large uncertainty (of\ntypically \u00b170 deg). Similarly, we could have considered the\norientation of the brightest cluster galaxy, but the choice\nof this galaxy is not always obvious. We therefore decided\nto rely only on the Serna-Gerbal results. Clear preferential\ndirections appear for LCDCS 0110 (300 deg), LCDCS 0130\n(220 deg), LCDCS 0172 (295 deg), LCDCS 0504 (240 deg),\nand LCDCS 0853 (25 deg). The prefered orientation for\nLCDCS 0110 is mainly explained by substructure 1 (see\nFig. 7). LCDCS 0130 shows a main orientation around 130\ndeg due to substructures 2 and 3, and there is a secondary\norientation due to substructure 1 around 100 deg. The\nprefered orientations for LCDCS 0172 and LCDCS 0504\nare due to all their substructures. Finally, the orientation\nof LCDCS 0853 is mainly driven by substructure 2.\nAdopting the orientation directions determined by the\nSerna-Gerbal method, we stacked the second residual images computed with the wavelet code using these same directions, and compared our results with those for the randomly oriented stack. The ratio of these two image stacks\ndoes not vary by more than 5%, which means that, there\nis no significant detected orientation in the ICL source\ndistribution.\n\namount of diffuse light and the cluster mass. We estimated\nthe mass (see Table 1) using the velocity dispersions and\nEq. 6 of Evrard et al. (2008). We still see a modest increase in the total F814W absolute magnitude of the diffuse light with mass, mainly because of the two highest\nmass clusters. We attempted to identify any obvious relation between the cluster M/L and the amount of ICL.\nWe were unable to find any clear trend (see Fig. 11) and\nsimply note that the amount of dark matter in a cluster does not appear to strongly influence the amount of\nmaterial expelled from galaxies that probably forms the\nICL (see also below). This is in good agreement with the\nsimulations of Dolag et al. (2010), which do not predict\nany significant relation between the cluster mass and the\nfraction of diffuse light in clusters.\n\nFig. 9. Relation between the cluster velocity dispersions\nfrom Halliday et al. (2004) and Milvang-Jensen et al.\n(2008) and the amount of diffuse light in the F814W band.\nThe red line has a slope of \u221285 km s\u22121 mag\u22121 . This figure\ndoes not show the low redshift clusters seen in Fig. 12.\n\n4.4. Amount of ICL as a function of cluster velocity\ndispersion\nAn obvious question is whether the amount of diffuse light\ndetected is related to the cluster properties. We now consider ICL detections in individual clusters. The magnitudes quoted in Table 1 are obviously lower limits, only\ncharacteristic of the diffuse light we are able to detect\ngiven our instrumental configuration. We show in Fig. 9\nthe relation between the cluster velocity dispersions (from\nHalliday et al. 2004 and Milvang-Jensen et al. 2008) and\nthe amount of diffuse light (see Table 1). We note here\nthat these velocity dispersions are reasonably close to the\nClowe et al. (2006) estimates.

Comparison with low redshift detections\nWe now place our results in perspective with our previous\nstudies of less distant clusters, namely Coma and A2667\n(see Adami et al. 2005 and Covone et al. 2006a respectively). The detection of diffuse light in these two structures has been made with the same wavelet method and\nthe results are therefore directly comparable. In Coma\n(z=0.023), Adami et al. detected diffuse light sources\nequivalent to a \u221222.6 galaxy in the F814W filter. This\nvalue was estimated by translating the Adami et al. (2005)\nR band Vega value to an F814W AB value using the\nFukugita et al. (1995) k-corrections (0.05 mag at the Coma\ncluster redshift) and elliptical galaxy colors. In A2667\n(z=0.233), we detected diffuse light sources equivalent to a\n\u221221.12 galaxy in the F814W filter (adopted k-correction:\n0.25 mag).\nThese values allow us to search for any evolution in\nthe amount of ICL in clusters between z\u223c0.8 and z=0.\nBefore trying to plot the amount of ICL in clusters as a\nfunction of redshift, we must correct for the dependence\non velocity dispersion and mass discernible in Figs. 9 and\n10. The best-fit relation between the velocity dispersion\n\u03c3v (respectively the mass) and the absolute magnitude of\nthe diffuse light in the F814W filter is\n\u03c3v = \u221285MF 814W \u2212 1056\nand\nM ass200 = \u22121.85MF 814W \u2212 32.66\nIf we assume that the same relation applies to Coma\nand A2667 (adopting velocity dispersions of 1200 km/s\nfor Coma from Adami et al. 2009 and 960 km/s for A2667\nfrom Covone et al. 2006b), we can correct for the differences in velocity dispersion between all the clusters considered here. Adopting the cluster masses of Kubo et al.\n(2007) and Ota & Mitsuda (2004) for Coma and A2667,\nwe can also correct for any dependence on mass. We show\n\nFig. 12. Relation between the total magnitude of the diffuse light in the F814W band and the cluster redshift.\nFilled symbols are raw values. Open circles are the ICL\ntotal F814W magnitudes corrected for the effects of velocity dispersion. Crosses are the values corrected for the\neffects of mass. The large square at the bottom left of the\nfigure represents the locus occupied by intracluster light\ndetected in the Gonz\u00e1lez et al. (2005) low-redshift clusters\n(see text).\n\nSeveral other studies have been performed at low redshift, some of which based on galaxy subtraction via\ntheir shape modeling (e.g. Gonz\u00e1lez et al. 2007, Krick &\nBernstein 2007, Rudick et al. 2010). These studies sometimes predict more diffuse light in structures than the\nstudies based on the wavelet method (e.g. Adami et al.\n2005, Covone et al. 2006a, Da Rocha et al. 2008).\nFor example, we can use the results of Gonz\u00e1lez et al.\n(2005) to make this comparison. By fitting several profiles\nof the brightest galaxies of 24 z=[0.03,0.13] galaxy clusters, these authors estimated the total magnitude included\nwithin several radii. This definition differs from the one\nadopted here (we do not use, for example, any parametric\nmodel of the diffuse light). However, we can adapt these\nvalues by removing the amount of light included in the\n10 kpc radius from the value included in the 50 kpc radius\nof Gonz\u00e1lez et al. (2005) (see their Table 6). Assuming a kcorrection factor of 0.07 (Gonz\u00e1lez et al. 2005), a F814W-I\nof 0.04 (Fukugita et al. 1995), and an AB-Vega correction\nfactor of 0.46, we then plot in Fig. 12 the locus occupied\nby the Gonz\u00e1lez et al. (2005) clusters. The diffuse light\nvalues are somewhat brighter than our present detections,\nperhaps because our typical ICL sources radii are close to\n20 kpc, hence less extended than the 50 kpc of Gonz\u00e1lez\net al. (2005).\n\n\f10\n\nGuennou et al.: Intracluster light in 0.4<z<0.8 clusters\n\n5.

In order to compare the WDCO colors with\ncess appears to detect very faint objects in the HST ACS very faint galaxies of massive clusters, we defined an apF814W images, that are sometimes not detected by classi- proximate locus for the red-sequence in the WDCO regime\n\n\fGuennou et al.: Intracluster light in 0.4<z<0.8 clusters\n\nassuming the mean V-F814W color from faint cluster\nmember galaxies defined in a deep Coma cluster spectroscopic redshift catalog (see Adami et al. 2009). We assumed a 1\u03c3 red envelope width of 0.7 at magnitudes between F814W=26 and 28 (leading to a 3\u03c3 width of \u00b12.1),\nbased on the typical cluster red-sequence 1\u03c3 width for\nComa at R=22 being close to 0.5 (see Adami et al. 2009).\nGiven the lack of knowledge of the red sequence width at\nF814W\u226526, we adopted the simplest approach of considering a horizontal envelope for the red sequence. We see\nin Fig. 13 that part of the WDCOs are also located on\nthe red-sequence defined above. The WDCOs with colors\nconsistent with the cluster red-sequence could therefore\nbe small, very faint, compact galaxies and members of the\nconsidered clusters (at least part of them).\nWe also note that most of the WDCOs are more than\none magnitude fainter than the SExtractor detection limit,\nand remarkably, nearly none of them are brighter than this\nlimit. Therefore, they appear to be an independent population in the three considered clusters or might also be\natypically faint Galactic stars. We cannot use SExtractor\nto make a classification since these WDCOs are by definition not detected by this code. We are similarly unable\nto place the WDCOs in a central magnitude versus total\nmagnitude plot because WDCOs usually have very irregular brightness profiles, hence a reliable computation of\nthe central brightness is impossible. We therefore fitted a\ntwo-dimensional Gaussian with an added constant background to each of the WDCO images. We assumed that\nthe full-width at half maximum (FWHM) of the Gaussian\nwas the HST ACS spatial resolution and only allowed the\nlevel of the background and the amplitude of the Gaussian\nto vary. We show in Fig. 14 the histogram of the reduced\n\u03c72 computed for the best fits.\nAll objects have quite large reduced \u03c72 values, making\nthem very unlikely to be faint stars. Even the lowest reduced \u03c72 values are on the order of 8, much too high for\nthis population to be dominated by objects limited by the\ninstrumental resolution.\nWe now consider the redshifts of these WDCOs: are\nthey part of the considered clusters? It is obviously impossible to measure their spectroscopic redshifts with the\ntelescopes presently available. Photometric redshifts are\nalso impossible to compute because these objects are only\ndetected in two bands and our photometry in the other\noptical bands is insufficiently deep. Beyond the colormagnitude relations already discussed, another way to investigate the cluster membership of these objects is then\nto study their spatial distribution. If cluster members for\npart of them, WDCOs should at least partially follow the\nlight of the cluster potential well. Fig. 15 clearly shows\nsuch a behavior. To generate this figure we used an adaptive kernel technique (e.g. Adami et al. 1998) and computed the projected density map on the sky of all the\ndetected WDCOs along the line of sight. We selected a\nstructure-free area and computed the 1\u03c3 variation in the\nWDCO density. Dividing the original WDCO density map\nby this value, this produced Fig. 15, which is expressed in\n\n11\n\nFig. 13. Color-magnitude diagram V-F814W versus\nF814W for the three considered clusters. Black dots represent the SExtractor-detected objects along the considered lines of sight. Blue-filled hexagons are the SExtractordetected objects in each cluster according to their spectroscopic redshift. Triangles are WDCOs with a \u03c72 lower than\n8, crosses with a \u03c72 between 8 and 10, pentagons with a \u03c72\nbetween 10 and 15, and small dots with higher \u03c72 values.\nFor these last four classes, red is the color for WDCOs detected in the first pass and green in the second pass.

The values of these four cyan circles were\ncomputed (from left to right) with 29689, 35804, 4788,\nand 511 galaxies. The large cyan open triangles with error\nbars are for the galaxies in the VIRMOS field with mean\nsurface brightness typical of the first pass WDCOs.

Fig. 16 clearly shows that we have no specific correlation of WDCOs with bright objects (stars or bright\ngalaxies). The density of WDCOs in this area is globally\nlower than in the central regions: the most significant concentrations detected in this area show at the 5\u03c3 level while\nFig. 15 shows concentrations at the 10\u03c3 level.\nWe therefore believe that our WDCOs are most probably not spurious detections and that part of them are\nlikely to be cluster members.\n\nFig. 14. Histogram of the reduced \u03c72 values obtained by\nmerging the results for the three clusters.\n\nunits of this 1\u03c3 variation. We clearly see a central concentration with a scale typical of a cluster (we used the mean\nredshift of the considered clusters to give Fig. 15 in units\nof kpc). If WDCOs are real, this is tempting evidence in\nfavor of these objects being cluster members.\nDespite the fact that the considered WDCOs are detected in two different bands observed with two different instruments, it could be argued that since they are\nsuch low signal to noise objects they could well be purely\nnoise at least partly occuring at the edges of bright objects and/or in noisy regions. We would then naturally\nexpect these \"spurious\" detections to be located near the\nhaloes of bright objects. They would then follow the cluster profile and this could explain why their spatial distribution is centrally concentrated. However, we first note\nthat the spatial distribution of WDCOs is not exactly centered on the cluster centers: a \u223c200 kpc shift is seen in\nFig. 15. Second, Fig. 15 also shows the location of the\nWDCOs in the stacked central cluster regions. We made\nthe sum of the images of LCDCS 0110, LCDCS 0340, and\nLCDCS 0541 after centering each image on the cluster\ncenter and rescaling to physical units (kpc). While a few\nof the WDCOs are indeed located in the vicinity of bright\nobjects and may well be spurious objects, the vast majority of WDCOs appears to be far from any bright object.\nMoreover, the higher noise part of images shown in Fig. 15\nexhibits only two WDCOs. It is therefore very likely that\nthe large majority of our WDCOs is not made of spurious\ndetections.\nWe made a last test: in the external parts of our deep\nHST images of LCDCS 0110, we considered a region populated with bright objects (including stars), but without any known cluster. If WDCOs were spurious objects\nwrongly detected at the edges of bright objects, we should\nthen detect significant concentrations of WDCOs in these\n\nFig. 15.

Local Group dwarf galaxies have typical\nV-band magnitudes between \u221213 and \u221214, in good agreement with the dwarf absolute magnitudes computed from\nour color-magnitude plots when we assume that WDCOs\non the red-sequence are part of the considered clusters.\nIt is therefore likely that part of these WDCOs are dwarf\ngalaxies similar to faint Local Group dwarfs.\n\n\fGuennou et al.: Intracluster light in 0.4<z<0.8 clusters\n\n6. Summary\nTo help us analyse the mechanisms taking place in galaxy\nclusters, and place constraints on their formation history\nand physical properties, we have searched for intracluster\nlight (ICL) in ten galaxy clusters at redshifts 0.4 <z< 0.8.\nFor the first time, we have detected significant diffuse light\nsources in an unprecedentedly high redshift bin z=[0.4,0.8]\nbased on very deep HST ACS images to which we have\napplied a very sensitive wavelet detection method. Until\nnow, most searches and detailed studies of ICL emission\nhave been limited to redshifts z< 0.4 because of the intrinsic faintness of ICL emission, so our study represents\na significant step forward in measuring any ICL evolution\nwith redshift.\nOur analysis has applied a wavelet code (see e.g.\nPereira 2003 and Da Rocha & Mendes de Oliveira 2005)\nto deep HST ACS images in the F814W filter and Vband VLT/FORS2 images (for three of the ten clusters).\nDetection levels have been assessed as a function of the\nsurface brightnesses of the diffuse light sources via simulations.\nIn the F814W filter, we have detected diffuse light\nsources in all the clusters with typical sizes of a few tens\nof kpc (assuming that the diffuse light sources are at the\ncluster redshifts). The ICL detected by stacking the ten\nF814W images shows a very clear 8\u03c3 detection in the\nsource center extending over a \u223c 50 \u00d7 50 kpc2 area. The\ntotal absolute magnitude of this source is \u221221.6 in the\nF814W filter, equivalent to about two L\u2217 galaxies for each\nof the 10 clusters.\nWe have also discussed the possible anisotropy of the\nICL distribution and the existence of substructures in the\ninner regions of the clusters. We have found a weak correlation between the total F814W absolute magnitude of\nthe ICL and both the velocity dispersion and the mass.\nNo correlation was found between the cluster M/L and\nthe amount of ICL (in agreement with Dolag et al. 2010),\nand there is no evidence for any special orientation in the\nICL source distributions. We have found no strong variation in the amount of ICL between z=0 and z=0.8, besides\nperhaps a modest increase.\nFinally, besides the extended ICL, we have also found\nWavelet-detected compact objects (WDCOs). Since these\nsources are very faint, we only considered those detected\nin both the HST/ACS/F814W and FORS2/V-band filters, in the three clusters for which sufficiently deep data\nin both bands are available. The fit of a two-dimensional\nGaussian plus a constant background on each of the\nWDCO images suggests that they are very unlikely to\nbe faint Galactic stars. On the other hand, part of the\nWDCOs are located on the cluster red sequences in colormagnitude diagrams and their spatial distribution also\nsuggests that they could be very faint compact galaxies\nbelonging to the considered clusters and comparable to\nfaint Local Group Dwarfs.\nAcknowledgements.
