We confirm the presence of the seven known ULXs with luminosities exceeding the\nEddington luminosity for a 10M \u2299 black hole, a low luminosity active galactic nucleus with 2 \u2212 10 keV\nluminosity of 1.6 \u00d7 1039 erg s\u22121 , and soft thermal extended emission from NGC 5194 detected with\nChandra. In addition, we also detected a new ULX with luminosity \u223c 1039 erg s\u22121 . We have studied\nthe spectral and temporal properties of the LLAGN and 8 ULXs in NGC 5194, and an ULX in\nNGC 5195. Two ULXs in NGC 5194 show evidence for short-term variability, and all but two ULXs\nvary on long time scales (over a baseline of \u223c 2.5 years), providing strong evidence that these are\naccreting sources. One ULX in NGC 5194, source 69, shows possible periodic behavior in its X-ray\nflux. We derive a period of 5925 \u00b1 200 s at a confidence level of 95%, based on three cycles. This\nperiod is lower than the period of 7620 \u00b1 500 s derived from a Chandra observation in 2000. The\nhigher effective area of XMM-Newton enables us to identify multiple components in the spectra of\nULXs. Most ULXs require at least two components \u2013 a power law and a soft X-ray excess component\nwhich is modeled by an optically thin plasma or multicolor disk blackbody (MCD). However, the\nsoft excess emission, inferred from all ULXs except source 69, are unlikely to be physically associated\nwith the ULXs as their strengths are comparable to that of the surrounding diffuse emission. The\nsoft excess emission of source 69 is well described either by a two temperature mekal plasma or a\nsingle temperature mekal plasma (kT \u223c 690 eV) and an MCD (kT \u223c 170 eV). The MCD component\nsuggests a cooler accretion disks compared to that in Galactic X-ray binaries and consistent with\nthat expected for intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs). An iron K\u03b1 line (EW \u223c 700 eV) or K\nabsorption edge at \u223c 7.1 keV is present in the EPIC PN spectrum of source 26. The spectrum of the\nULX in NGC 5195, source 12, is consistent with a simple power law. The LLAGN in NGC 5194 shows\nan extremely flat hard X-ray power-law (\u0393 \u223c 0.7), a narrow iron K\u03b1 line at 6.4 keV (EW \u223c 3 keV),\nand strong soft X-ray excess emission. The full band spectrum is well described by a two component\nmekal plasma and reflection from cold material such as putative torus.\nSubject headings: accretion, accretion disks - galaxies: active - galaxies: individual (M 51) -\nX-rays: binaries - X-rays: galaxies\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\nX-ray emission from spiral galaxies consists of several components including an active nucleus (if present),\nextra-nuclear point X-ray sources, hot gas, supernova etc.\nMany spiral galaxies contain a mildly or non-active nucleus and, in this case, the luminosity in the X-ray band\nis dominated by the emission from a few luminous offnuclear point sources (Roberts & Warwick 2000). The\nbrightest of these X-ray sources, with luminosities exceeding the Eddington luminosity for a 10M \u2299 black hole,\nare defined as the ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs).\nThese objects, which may sometimes individually outshine the rest of the galaxy, were first discovered in Einstein observations (Fabbiano & Trincheri 1987; Fabbiano\n1989). Later they were detected in large numbers by\nROSAT (Colbert & Mushotzky 1999; Roberts & Warwick 2000; Colbert & Ptak 2002). The first detailed\nX-ray spectral characteristics of ULXs were revealed by\nASCA and demonstrated that most ULXs exhibit multicolor disk blackbody spectra with a 'high temperature'\n1 Department of Physics, Carnegie Mellon University, 5000\nForbes Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15213 USA\n2 National Center for Radio Astrophysics, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Pune 411007, India\n\nsimilar to that observed from Galactic X-ray binaries in\ntheir high state. Some ULXs were also found to vary\nand make a transition, at lower luminosities, to powerlaw spectra, similar to the spectral transitions seen in\nmany Galactic XRBs. However, the observed X-ray\nflux of many ULXs implies (assuming isotropic emission\nand Eddington-luminosity limited systems) black holes\nof \u223c 102 \u2212 104 M \u2299. These masses are much larger than\nthe measured masses of known Galactic X-ray binaries\nor black holes (GXRBs or GBHs) and much lower than\nthe measured masses of active galactic nuclei, thus making them candidates for intermediate-mass black holes\n(IMBHs).\nSeveral models have been proposed to explain the high\nluminosities of ULXs. These include (i) accreting IMBHs\nwith sub-Eddington rates (e.g., Colbert & Mushotzky\n1999), (ii) XRBs with anisotropic emission (King et al.\n2001), (iii) beamed XRBs with relativistic jets directly\npointing towards us i. e., scaled down versions of blazars\n(Mirabel & Rodriguez 1999), and (iv) XRBs with superEddington accretion rates (Begelman 2002). A few ULXs\nhave been found to be young supernova (e.g., SN 1979,\nImmler, Pietsch & Aschenbach 1998) with X-ray emission powered by the interactions of shock waves and the\nsurrounding dense inter stellar medium. Some of the\n\n\f2\naccretion-powered ULXs are also observed to be associated with older supernova remnant-like structures (e.g.,\nIC 342-X1, Roberts et al. 2003). The recent observation of a break at a frequency of \u223c 28 mHz in the power\ndensity spectrum of the ULX NGC 4559 X-7 suggests a\nmass of a few thousands solar masses, consistent with the\nmeasured thermal temperature of kT = 120 eV. This observation clearly supports the IMBH scenario for ULXs.\nIt has become increasingly clear that there are two separate populations of ULXs. A large number of ULXs are\nlocated in regions of current star formation in star-burst\nand spiral galaxies (The Antennae, Zezas et al. 2002;\nNGC 3256, Lira et al. 2002; NGC 4485/90, Roberts et\nal. 2002; Arp 299, Zezas, Ward, & Murray 2003; M 51,\nTerashima & Wilson 2004). These ULXs are likely to be\nassociated with young stellar populations. Other ULXs\nhave been observed in early-type elliptical/SO galaxies\nand are likely to be associated with older stellar populations. A recent study of the ULX population of 82\ngalaxies by Swartz et al. (2004) suggests that \u223c 25% of\nthese sources may be background objects, including 14%\nin spiral galaxies and 44% in elliptical galaxies.\nChandra has revolutionized the detection of ULXs primarily due to its superior angular resolution (see e. g.,\nSwartz et al. 2004). XMM-Newton, on the other hand,\nhas been probing the detailed characteristics of the ULX\npopulations in nearby galaxies due to its large effective area. XMM-Newton is well suited to study detailed\nspectral and temporal characteristics of ULXs in nearby\ngalaxies (e.g., Strohmayer & Mushotzky 2003; Cropper\net al. 2003; Miller et al. 2004; Dewangan et al. 2004).\nM 51, also known as the Whirlpool galaxy, is a faceon spiral galaxy and is located at a distance of 8.4 Mpc\n(Feldmeier et al. 1997). Optical studies of emission lines\nclassified it as a LINER or a Seyfert 2 galaxy (Stauffer\n1982). Furthermore, Ho et al. (1997) suggest the presence of a broad H\u03b1 line. Kohno et al. (1996) found a\nnuclear molecular disk, and constrained the dynamical\nmass within 70 pc of the nucleus to be 4 \u2212 7 \u00d7 106 M\u2299 .\nThis indicates that M 51 hosts as massive a black hole\nas many AGNs.\nX-ray observations also strongly suggest the presence\nof an AGN in M 51. Einstein (Palumbo et al. 1985) and\nROSAT (Marston et al. 1995; Ehle et al. 1995) observations constrained the soft X-ray luminosity of the M 51\nnucleus to be LX < 5 \u00d7 1039 erg s\u22121 . Ginga scanning\nobservations in 1988 detected bright hard X-ray emission with 2 \u2212 20 keV luminosity of \u223c 1.2 \u00d7 1041 erg s\u22121 ,\na photon index of 1.43 \u00b1 0.08 and an intrinsic absorption of < 7 \u00d7 1021 cm\u22122 (Makishima et al. 1990). Such\nhard nuclear X-ray emission is often considered to be\nevidence for a low luminosity AGN (LLAGN). ASCA\nobserved M 51 in the hard (2 \u2212 10 keV) X-ray band\nin 1993, and did not detect such a bright hard component. Instead, a faint hard X-ray continuum with a\nneutral Fe K\u03b1 line was detected, whose flux was an order of magnitude lower than that measured by Ginga\n(Terashima et al. 1998). The reason for this large difference in luminosity has recently been clarified by BeppoSAX observations. Fukazawa et al. (2001) find that\nthe nucleus is photoelectrically absorbed below 10 keV\nbut is observed directly above 20 keV, implying an absorbing column of NH \u2243 5.6 \u00d7 1024 cm\u22122 . The 2-10 keV\nluminosity measured by BeppoSAX was similar to that\n\nof ASCA. Fukazawa et al. (2001) attributed the higher\nGinga luminosity to variability of the absorbing column.\nHigh angular resolution ROSAT HRI observations also\nrevealed eight X-ray point sources and diffuse soft X-ray\nemission in M 51. Chandra observed M 51 during June\n2000 and June 2001 with ACIS-S. These data have been\nstudied in detail by Terashima & Wilson (2001, 2004).\nThe X-ray image revealed the nucleus, 113 X-ray sources\nand extended emission which resembled the morphology of both the radio and optical emission line images\n(Terashima & Wilson 2001). The X-ray image of the\nnucleus is well represented by a model consisting of soft\nthermal plasma (kT \u2243 0.5 keV), a very hard continuum\nand an Fe K\u03b1 emission line at 6.45 keV with an equivalent width of greater than 2 keV. The X-ray spectra\nof the extra-nuclear clouds are well fitted by a thermal\nplasma model with kT \u2243 0.5 keV. The spectral shape\nand morphology strongly suggest that the clouds are\nshock-heated by a bipolar outflow from the nucleus. Out\nof 113 extra-nuclear sources, 9 sources have luminosities\nexceeding 1039 erg s\u22121 in the 0.5-8 keV band. The number of extra-nuclear sources in M 51 is much higher than\nin most other normal spiral and elliptical galaxies and is\nsimilar to galaxies experiencing star-burst activity. The\nX-ray spectra of most of the detected sources are consistent with a power-law spectral form with a photon index\nbetween 1 and 2, while one source has an extremely hard\nspectrum and two sources have particularly soft spectra.\nThe X-ray spectra of three of the ULXs are consistent\nwith both a power-law and multi-color blackbody model.\nOne ULX showed a remarkable spectrum with prominent\nemission lines.\nIn this paper we present an XMM-Newton EPIC observation of M 51. Utilizing the large collecting area of\nXMM-Newton, we have studied spectral and temporal\nproperties of nine ULXs and the LLAGN in M 51. The\npaper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2, we outline the\nobservation and the data selection. In Sect. 3, 4, and\n5, we present the spatial, temporal, spectral analysis.\nSect. 6 describes properties of the individual ULXs. We\ndiscuss the results in Sect. 7, followed by conclusions in\nSect. 8.\n2. OBSERVATIONS AND DATA SELECTION\n\nThe galaxy M 51 was observed by XMM-Newton observatory (Jansen et al. 2001) on 2003 January 15 for a\nduration of \u223c 21 ks. The EPIC PN (Str\u00fcder et al. 2001)\nand MOS (Turner et al. 2001) cameras were operated in\nfull-frame mode using the thin filter. The optical monitor\n(OM) instrument and the reflection grating spectrometers operated simultaneously with the EPIC cameras.\nThe raw PN and MOS events were processed and filtered using the most recent version of the calibration\ndatabase and analysis software (SAS v6.0) available in\nMarch 2004. Examination of the background light curves\nextracted from source-free regions showed that our observations was not strongly affected by particle induced\nflares. Events in known bad pixels were discarded. For\nthe spectral analysis, we used events with patterns 0\u20134\n(single and double) and flag zero for the PN, and patterns 0\u201312 (similar to ASCA event grades 0\u20134) and flag\nzero for the MOS. However, for the temporal analysis,\nwe used all events with pattern 0\u201312 for both the PN\nand MOS cameras.\n\n\f3\n3. SPATIAL ANALYSIS\n\nWe extracted PN images in the full (0.2 \u2212 10 keV),\n0.2 \u2212 0.7 keV, 0.7 \u2212 2 keV, and 2 \u2212 10 keV bands. First\nwe adaptively smoothed the full band image using the\nCIAO task csmooth and created a smoothing kernel. The\nimages in the 0.2 \u2212 0.7 keV, 0.7 \u2212 2 keV and 2 \u2212 10 keV\nbands were then adaptively smoothed using the kernel\ncreated above, and combined to form a three-color image shown in Figure 1 (Left). The color image shows\nseveral discrete sources, diffuse soft emission, and the\nbright nucleus of NGC 5194. Interestingly, the bright\nnucleus of NGC 5194 actually consists of two hard Xray sources \u223c 20\u2032\u2032 apart (see below). Also present is the\ncompanion galaxy NGC 5195 showing diffuse emission,\nmultiple sources in the central region, and a bright point\nsource to the left of the nucleus. To avoid any possible\nconfusion on multiple source identification numbers arising from multiple X-ray missions, we follow the Chandra\nsource identification numbers as set by Terashima & Wilson (2004). Figure 1 (right) shows the EPIC PN image in\nthe 2 \u2212 10 keV band and the positions of the ULXs studied in this paper have been marked. The ULX source 9 in\nNGC 5194 is not seen in the hard band image image due\nto its location in the chip gap and its extreme softness.\nThe source counts and positions listed in Table 1 have\nbeen determined by a source detection procedure by utilizing a series of SAS tasks as described by Miyaji et al.\n(2003). In short, an input image is searched for pointlike sources by a simple sliding-cell detection method\nwith local background using eboxdetect. This is followed\nby a \"background map\" creation by a spline fit to the\nsource-excluded region using esplinemap. A sliding cell\ndetection is repeated to find excess over this background\nmap (eboxdetect). The final source positions and counts\nare determined by a multi-source maximum-likelihood fit\nwith the XMM-Newton PSF, using the sources detected\nin the previous step as the starting points (emldetect).\nIn order to be free from the effects of soft diffuse emission, which could prevent the accurate determination of\nthe background map, the hard-band (2-10 keV) image is\nused to obtain the source counts, except source 9, which\nhas not been detected in the hard band. In Figure 2,\nwe show the UV image of M 51 taken with the XMMNewton OM. The image shows beautiful spiral arms, a\nprominent nucleus, and bright star clusters surrounding\nthe nucleus with either a ring-like morphology or multiple inner spiral arms. One of the spiral arm of NGC 5194\nappears to be tidally connected to the companion galaxy\nNGC 5195. This galaxy shows a bright nucleus with dark\ndust lanes near the nucleus.\nIn Fig. 2, we have overlaid the X-ray contours onto\nthe UV image. The contours represent the hard (1.5 \u2212\n12 keV) X-ray sources only. Fig. 2 highlights the\ntwo bright hard X-ray sources in the central region of\nNGC 5194. The two sources are separated by \u223c 20\u2032\u2032 .\nThe fainter of the two X-ray sources coincides with the\nUV nucleus. The brighter source is an ULX, which is\nclearly resolved in Chandra images (Terashima & Wilson 2004).\nIn this paper we study the active nucleus and the\npoint sources with luminosities \u2265 1039 erg s\u22121 in the\n0.3 \u2212 12 keV band. There are eight ULXs in addition\nto the LLAGN in NGC 5194. There is also a well iso-\n\nlated ULX in the companion galaxy NGC 5195. However, the central region of NGC 5195 consists of multiple\nbright point sources and extended soft emission as seen in\nthe Chandra ACIS-S image (Terashima & Wilson 2004).\nDue to lower angular resolution of XMM-Newton, it is\nnot possible to extract counts for individual sources in\nthe central region of NGC 5195. Therefore we exclude\nthe bright sources in the central region of NGC 5195 from\nour analysis. The Chandra source NGC 5194#63 had an\nX-ray luminosity < 1039 erg s\u22121 during the two previous\nChandra observations. In this observation this source has\na luminosity of \u223c 2 \u00d7 1039 erg s\u22121 in the 0.3 \u2212 10 keV\nband and we now include this source in our sample.\n4. TEMPORAL ANALYSIS\n4.1. Short-term variability\n\nWe extracted 0.2 \u2212 12 keV X-ray light curves for the\nLLAGN and ULXs in M 51 from the EPIC PN data. The\nextraction regions had radii in the range of 15 \u2212 35\u2032\u2032 and\nenclosed > 60% of the X-ray emission from each source.\nThe smallest circular regions were chosen to avoid contamination from nearby sources. We used time bins of\n520 s and required that the bins be at least 50% exposed\nin order to minimize the errors due to the low number of\ncounts from the weak sources. We also extracted individual background light curves for each of the sources using\ncircular regions lying approximately at the same readout\ndistance as that for the source. The source light curves\nwere then corrected for the background contribution using the background light curves and appropriate scaling\nfactors to take into account the different extraction areas.\nWe fit a constant count rate model to each of the light\ncurves to investigate the possibility of rapid variability.\nWe rebin the light curves, if required, to ensure a minimum of 20 counts per bin to allow the use of \u03c72 fitting\nstatistics. The results for each light curve are listed in\nTable 2. We find that only two of the sources show significant variability: source 26 (at the 98.6% confidence\nlevel) and source 69 (99.95% confidence level). The light\ncurves of these two sources are plotted in Figure 3.\n4.2. Periodicity\n\nSource 69 shows the most significant rapid variability.\nThe light curve shows three tentative peaks at regular\nintervals. The first Chandra observation of this ULX\nin June 2000 showed two peaks separated by \u223c 7000 s.\nThese features were interpreted by Liu et al. (2002) as\na signal with a period of \u223c 2.1 hr. We have searched\nfor a similar periodic signal in the XMM-Newton light\ncurves. For this purpose, we combined the PN and MOS\nlight curves, binned to 520 s. The initial search for periodicity in the source, as well as the folding of the light\ncurve with respect to the final period obtained was performed with the XRONOS 5.19 package, which is a part\nof FTOOLS 5.2. The periodogram was obtained using\nthe algorithm of Scargle (1982), following the recipe of\nnormalizing the periodogram power using the total variance of the complete light curve as prescribed by Horne\n& Baliunas (1986). This algorithm is very robust for\ndetecting periodic signals in light curves with few data\npoints as well as non-uniformly distributed observational\ndata, while providing a 'false alarm probability' of the\nperiodicity arising in the light curve from random noise.\n\n\f4\nThis probability is obtained using the signal to noise ratio, where the variance of the noise is obtained under\nthe basic assumption that it is a normally distributed\nrandom variable. The periodogram is shown in Figure 4\n(left). The period obtained was 5925\u00b1200 s, with a 'false\nalarm probability' of 0.045, suggesting that the observed\nmodulation is not generated by the statistical fluctuation\nof the noise, to a confidence level of 95.5%. The main\nsource of the noise in the power in the Fourier frequency\ndomain are the inherent statistical fluctuations at scales\n< 2 ks (Figure 4). We have tested for the periodicity\non top of a constant count rate. However, in reality, the\nsource probably has a red-noise power spectrum, similar to XRBs. Therefore, the \u223c 2\u03c3 or 95.5% detection of\nthe period is an upper limit, and the periodicity may or\nmay not be a true signal. Future long baseline X-ray observations will be crucial for the robust detection of the\nperiodicity from this ULX. In Figure 4 (right) we provide\nthe light curve folded with respect to the period of 5925\ns, with a bin size of 520 s. Evidently, the modulation\nfraction is in excess of 45%, similar to the estimate of\nLiu et al. (2002).\n4.3. Long-term Variability\nWe have compared the 0.5 \u2212 8 keV fluxes derived from\nthe XMM-Newton observation (see below) and earlier\ntwo observations with Chandra (Terashima & Wilson\n2004) in June 2000 and June 2001. Figure 5 shows\nthe comparison of the fluxes. Cross-calibration results\nsuggest that the fluxes measured with Chandra and\nXMM-Newton agree at a level better than 10% (Snowden 2002). Thus, all the ULXs, except NGC 5194#41\nand NGC 5195#12, show long-term significant variability over a baseline of 2.5 yr.\n5. SPECTRAL ANALYSIS\n\nFor each ULX and the LLAGN, we extracted source\nand background spectra from the final filtered PN event\nlist using the same extraction regions that we used for\nthe PN light curves. We also extracted the source spectra from the MOS data using source regions similar to\nthat used for the PN. The background MOS spectra for\nthe individual ULXs were extracted using circles in the\nnearby source-free regions. Appropriate PN and MOS\nresponses and effective area files were created for each\nsource using the SAS tasks rmfgen and arfgen. A grouping of 20 counts per spectral channel resulted in significant degradation in the spectral resolution of the ULX\nspectra above 2kev. Therefore, all the source spectra\nwere grouped to a minimum of 10 counts per spectral\nchannel so that discrete spectral features are not missed.\nThe spectra were analyzed with the XSPEC 11.3 spectral analysis package (Arnaud 1996), and using the Cstatistics instead of \u03c72 -statistic which is not useful in\n< 20) counts per bin. Unlike the \u03c72 the case of low ( \u223c\nstatistic, the C-statistic does not provide a goodness-offit (GOF) criterion. Therefore we simulate 5000 spectra\nbased on the best-fit model derived using the C-statistic,\nand calculate the percentage of these spectra with the\nC-statistic less than that for the data. This number provides the GOF, and if this number is \u223c 50%, then the\nmodel is a good fit to the observed spectrum (similar to\nthe reduced \u03c72 \u223c 1 criterion), though obviously we cannot statistically exclude fits for which GOF\u2264 95%. The\n\nconfidence intervals are calculated in the same way as in\nthe case of \u03c72 -statistic. All the errors quoted below were\ncalculated at 90% confidence level for one interesting parameter i.e., \u2206C = 2.7.\nAt first the MOS and PN spectra of a few bright\nsources were fitted separately to check for the possible uncertainties due to cross-calibration problems. We\nfound generally good agreement between MOS and PN\ncameras in the 0.3 \u2212 10 keV bands. Therefore we present\nthe spectral results obtained by fitting the same model\njointly to the PN and MOS data while leaving the relative normalizations to vary.\n5.1. The low luminosity AGN in NGC 5194\n\nAn absorbed power-law model is a poor fit to the PN\nand MOS spectra of the nucleus of NGC 5194 (C =\n4117.2 for 409 degrees of freedom (dof), GOF=100.0%).\nTo show the significant spectral features, we fitted the absorbed power-law model in the 3 \u2212 5 keV and 7 \u2212 10 keV\nbands and plotted the ratio of the observed data in the\n0.3 \u2212 10 keV band and the best-fit power-law in Figure 6.\nA strong soft X-ray excess below 1.5 keV and a narrow\niron K\u03b1 line at 6.4 keV are evident in the spectrum. The\nX-ray image, shown in Fig. 1, clearly shows presence of\nextended emission which we interpret as originating from\noptically thin thermal plasma. Accordingly, we added a\nmekal component to describe the soft component and\na Gaussian line model at 6.4 keV. The fit improves\nsignificantly (C = 452.3 for 404 dof, GOF = 88.5%),\nhowever, the soft X-ray emission is not well described.\nThere are still line-like residuals below 2 keV, suggesting\neither the hot gas responsible for the soft excess emission has a temperature structure and/or its abundance\nratio is non-solar. Including an additional mekal component (model 1) further improves the fit (C = 414.7 for\n401 dof; 47.8%), and removes the soft residuals seen earlier. The best-fit temperatures are kT = 171+23\n\u221229 eV and\n+16\nkT = 610\u221214 eV, and the best-fit abundances, relative\n+0.05\nto solar, are 0.20+2.49\n\u22120.14 and 0.18\u22120.02 for the two mekal\ncomponents. The observed data, the best-fit model and\ntheir ratio are plotted in Figure 7. We also tested the\npossibility of the non-solar abundance ratio by replacing\nthe two mekal component by a vmekal component (model\n2) which allows the abundance ratios of individual elements to vary. This model also improved the fit over that\ninvolving a single mekal component. The best-fit parameters for both models are listed in Table 3. Model 1 and 2\ndescribe the data statistically equally well (GOF = 48%,\nand 47% for model 1 and 2, respectively). Both models\nresult in an extremely flat hard X-ray slope (< 0.8), and\nstrong iron K\u03b1 line (EW \u223c 3 keV) from neutral material.\nThe flat spectrum and strong iron line strongly suggest that the hard X-ray emission from the LLAGN\nin NGC 5194 is dominated by reflection from a cold\nmaterial. Previous BeppoSAX observations of M 51\nshowed the LLAGN is obviously Thomson thick (NH =\n24\ncm\u22122 ; Fukazawa et al. 2001). There5.6+4.0\n\u22121.6 \u00d7 10\nfore, we replaced the simple power-law model with the\nCompton reflection model pexrav (Magdziarz & Zdziarski\n1995). This model calculates the reflected spectrum from\na neutral disk exposed to an exponentially cutoff powerlaw spectrum. Since XMM-Newton does not cover the\nexpected peak (20\u201340 keV) of the reflection component,\n\n\f5\nit is not possible to tightly constrain all the parameters\nof the reflection model using this data alone. Instead,\nwe fix the power-law photon index at 1.9, cutoff energy\nof the primary power law at 200 keV, disk inclination at\n70 degrees and the abundance of heavy elements at 0.1\nrelative to solar value. We also fixed the relative amount\nof reflection, R = 1, corresponding to an isotropic source\nabove a reflecting plane. The only variable parameter of\nthe pexriv model was the normalization of the incident\npower law. We chose a high inclination angle due to the\nThomson-thick nature of the LLAGN. We also set the reflection model to produce the reflection component alone.\nThis corresponds to a situation in which the primary Xray emission is completely absorbed by a column density\nin excess of \u223c 1024 cm\u22122 along the line of sight and we\nobserve the X-ray emission scattered by the matter near\nthe nucleus. We also include a narrow Gaussian line\nmodel to describe the Fe K emission. Fitting the above\nmodel (model 3) resulted in no strong apparent residuals.\nModel 3 consisting of two mekal components, Compton\nreflection, and a narrow Gaussian resulted in C = 420.9\nfor 400 dof and GOF = 61.8%. We consider this model\nto be the best-fit model as it is more physical than th earlier model involving simple power-law. The best-fit mekal\n+13\ntemperatures are 177+36\n\u221232 eV, 614\u221211 eV. The iron line\n+1.4\nequivalent width is 2.5\u22121.4 keV, similar to that measured\nfrom Chandra observations (Levenson et al. 2002). The\nbest-fit parameters are listed in Table 3 (Model 3). The\nobserved flux is 8.2 \u00d7 10\u221213 erg s\u22121 in the 0.3 \u2212 10 keV\nband, and 2.0 \u00d7 10\u221213 erg s\u22121 in the 2 \u2212 10 keV band,\nwhich correspond to luminosities 6.9\u00d71039 erg s\u22121 in the\n0.3 \u2212 10 keV band, and 1.7 \u00d7 1039 erg s\u22121 , respectively.\n5.2. ULXs in M 51\n\nWe performed joint fits for the PN and MOS spectra of each ULX with the following spectral models:\n(i) a power law (PL), (ii) multicolor accretion disk\nblackbody (MCD), (iii) thermal plasma (mekal), (iv)\nPL+MCD, (v) PL+mekal. The models also incorporate\nphotoelectric absorption (wabs with a minimum value of\n1.5 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 , the Galactic absorption in the direction\nof M 51; Stark et al. 1992). We assume an abundance of\n0.1 relative to the solar in all the mekal components. The\npoint spread function for the two sources 82 and 37 partially coincide with PN CCD chip gaps and/or bad pixel\ncolumns, prompting us to restrict ourselves to using only\nMOS data for the spectral analysis of these sources. One\nor more of the above models provided a reasonably good\nfit to all the ULXs except for sources 9, 26 and 69. The\nbest-fit models and the unfolded X-ray spectra of these\nULXs are shown in Figure 8. The best-fit parameters\nare listed in Table 4. We have also listed the 0.5 \u2212 8 keV\nobserved flux and luminosity for the PN data in Table 4.\nThe errors on flux were estimated at 90% level based on\n1000 sets of parameter values drawn from the distribution that is assumed to be multivariate Gaussian centered\non the best-fit parameters with sigmas from the covariance matrix. The fluxes measured with PN and MOS\ncameras are within the 90% errors quoted in Table 4.\nThe mekal model alone does not provide a good fit to\nthe spectra of all ULXs except source 12, therefore the\nbest-fit parameters are not listed in Table 4.\nX-ray spectra of sources 5, 37 and 41 in NGC 5194 are\n\nequally well described by a PL+MCD or a PL+mekal\nmodel, while source 63 prefers PL+mekal model. Two\nULXs source 82 in NGC 5194 and source 12 in NGC 5195\nonly requires a single spectral component. Source 82 is\ndescribed by a simple power law and does not statistically\nrequire any soft component at a level \u2265 99%. Source 12\nis well described either by a simple power law or a mekal\nmodel. In Table 4, we have listed the reduction in the\nC-statistic value (\u2206C) for \u2206p additional parameters for\nthe addition of a soft component (mekal, MCD or both,\nsee below) to the simple power-law model. We have also\nlisted the statistical significance derived from the maximum likelihood ratio (MLR) test. The 99% criterian for\nselecting the more complex model is significance < 0.01.\nAs a caveat we note that the MLR test is statistically not\nrobust in cases that involve testing a hypothesis that is\non the boundary of the parameter space e.g., the null values of the normalizations of MCD, mekal and Gaussian\nlines occur in the simple power law model (Protassov et\nal. 2002). The results of the MLR test presented here\nshould be treated only as indicative.\nThe spectra of sources 9, 26 and 69 are not satisfactorily described by any of the four models mentioned above.\nSource 9 is the softest ULX in our sample. Although not\na good fit, the PL+MCD model is marginally better than\nthe PL+mekal model for this ULX (see Table 4). Adding\na mekal component to the PL+MCD model improves the\nfit (\u2206C = \u22129.7 for two additional parameters), and results in a good fit (C = 59.8 for 50 dof, GOF = 46.9%).\nReplacing the MCD component by another mekal component in the PL+MCD+mekal model slightly worsened\nthe fit (C = 67.9 for 51 dof; GOF = 78.2%).\nThe ULX source 26 is located in the region of strong,\nextended soft X-ray emission. Its X-ray spectrum is not\nwell described either by a simple power law or an optical thin plasma. Similar to the spectral modeling of the\nLLAGN, we used multiple mekal components to describe\nthe soft emission. Two mekal components are statistically required to explain the soft X-ray excess emission.\nThe addition of the second mekal component is significant at a level > 99.99% (\u2206C = \u221228 for two additional\nparameters). In Figure 9, we show the ratio of the EPIC\ndata and the best-fit model consisting of two mekal components and an absorbed power-law. An iron K\u03b1 line at\n\u223c 6.4 keV is clearly seen in the spectrum. The addition\nof a Gaussian line improves the fit (\u2206C = 19.2 for three\nadditional parameters). The best-fit resulted in C = 278\nfor 295 dof (GOF = 9.3%). The observed EPIC data, the\nbest-fit model and their ratio are plotted in Figure 10.\nThe best-fit parameters are listed in Table 5.\nThe above fit clearly shows the presence of a Gaussian line. The best-fit line parameters are Eline =\n+180\n+1.5\n6.33+0.11\n\u22120.13 keV, \u03c3 = 158\u2212155 eV, line flux fline = 2.3\u22121.2 \u00d7\n\u22126\n\u22122 \u22121\n10 photons cm s\nand EW = 550 eV, consistent\nwith an iron K\u03b1 line from neutral material. The LLAGN\nin NGC 5194, a Compton-thick AGN, also shows strong\n(EW \u223c 3 keV; see also Levenson et al. 2002). The\nULX NGC 5194#26 is separated by only 28\u2032\u2032 from the\nLLAGN. The fractional encircled energy for the PN is\n\u223c 80% at a redius of 28\u2032\u2032 . The location of NGC 5194#26\nwithin the wings of the point spread function and the\nvery strong narrow iron line of LLAGN raise doubt if\nthe iron K\u03b1 emission inferred from the ULX is sim-\n\n\f6\nply cross-contamination from the LLAGN. To investigate\nthis possibility, we extracted a background spectrum using circular regions with centers at the same distance\nfrom the LLAGN as that of NGC 5194#26. The radii\nof the two circles were chosen to be the same as that\nof the circular region used to extract the spectrum of\nNGC 5194#26. We used the PN data only and carried out the spectral analysis in the 2 \u2212 10 keV band.\nA simple absorbed power-law model provided C = 83.8\nfor 77 dof and GOF = 57.0%. Addition of a Gaussian line improved the fit (\u2206C = \u221213.4 for three additional parameter). The best-fit parameters are \u0393 =\n+0.5\n\u22124\n2.4+0.5\nphotons cm\u22122 s\u22121 keV\u22121 ,\n\u22120.5 , nP L = 3.0\u22121.8 \u00d7 10\n+0.2\n+380\nEline = 6.3\u22120.2 keV, \u03c3 = 210\u2212140 eV, fline = 2.7+2.7\n\u22121.5 \u00d7\n\u22126\n\u22122 \u22121\n10 photons cm s , EW = 690 eV. Replacing the\nGaussian line with an accretion disk line (the diskline\nmodel in XSPEC) resulted in C = 69.5 for 74 dof. The\nbest-fit parameters are Eline = 6.3+0.3\n\u22120.4 keV, disk in+2.3\nclination angle, i = 26+32\ndegree,\nf\nline = 3.9\u22121.9 \u00d7\n\u221226\n10\u22126 photons cm\u22122 s\u22121 . The emissivity index, inner and\nouter radii were kept fixed at \u22122.5, 6rg and 1000rg ,\nrespectively, where rg is the gravitational radius. The\naddition of the diskline to the simple power law model\nimproved the fit at a significance level of 99.7%. We\nalso tested if the broad iron line-like feature could be\ndescribed in terms of an absorption edge. Addition of\nan edge at \u223c 7.1 keV to the absorbed power-law model\nimproved the fit (C = 70.6 for 75 dof). The best-fit pa22\nrameters are NH = 2.5+2.1\ncm\u22122 , \u0393 = 1.2+0.6\n\u22122.3 \u00d7 10\n\u22120.6 ,\n+0.2\nedge energy Eedge = 7.1\u22120.1 keV and \u03c4 = 1.4+0.8\n.\nThus\n\u22120.6\nthe 2 \u2212 10 keV EPIC PN spectrum of source 26 is equally\nwell described by an absorbed power law and a broad iron\nline at \u223c 6.3 keV or an iron K-edge at \u223c 7.1 keV. It is\nstill possible that the background correction, we adopted\nhere, may not be accurate due to poor signal-to-noise of\nthe data, the presence of extended X-ray emission and\nmoderate spatial resolution of XMM-Newton. Future\nlong X-ray observations with Chandra and XMM-Newton\nwill help detecting the line and/or edge unambiguously.\nSource 69 is located in a region of extended soft Xray emission in an spiral arm. It is likely that Xray emission from source 69 is contaminated by the\nextended emission. Adding another mekal component\nto the PL+mekal model improved the fit significantly\n(\u2206C = 52.7 for two additional parameters; C = 191.9\nfor 200 dof; GOF = 18%). The best-fit parameters are\nlisted in Table 4. Replacing one of the mekal component by the MCD component slightly worsened the fit\n(C = 200.9 for 199 dof, GOF = 29.2%). However, both\nthe fits are acceptable. The spectral data and the best-fit\nmodel PL+mekal+mekal are plotted in Figure 8.\nWe compared the soft excess flux in the 0.3 \u2212 2 keV\nband, modeled as mekal component above a power-law,\nof ULXs with that of the diffuse emission in the surrounding regions. We estimated the flux of the diffuse\nemission from the count rates measured in annular regions centered at the source positions or nearby circular\nregions. We used the best-fit mekal temperature, estimated from the PL+mekal model for an ULX, to convert the appropriately scaled count rate of the nearby\ndiffuse emission into the flux in the 0.3 \u2212 2 keV. For\nall ULXs except source 69, the nearby diffuse emission\n\nis comparable to the soft excess emission, suggesting\nthat the soft excess emission may not be associated with\nthese ULXs . The soft excess emission of source 69\n(fmekal \u223c 6.6 \u00d7 10\u221214 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 ) is about a factor\nof four stronger than the surrounding diffuse emission in\nthe 0.3 \u2212 2 keV band. Thus, at least a part of the soft\nexcess emission is intrinsic to the ULX.\n5.2.1. The comptonized accretion disk model\n\nThe power law and the MCD model used to fit the ULX\nspectra above are only a mathematical approximation of\nthe real physical spectra and do not provide much physical insight. Therefore, we also tried a spectral model\nbased on 'real' physics of an accretion disk-corona system. This model called as the 'comptonized accretion\ndisk (CMCD)' has been used to describe the spectra of\nsix bright ULXs (Wang et al. 2004). The CMCD model\nwas constructed by Yao et al. (2003). The model assumes a thermal energy distribution for electrons in a\nspherical corona around an accretion disk. The parameters of the CMCD model are the radius of the spherical\ncorona (Rc ), electron temperature (Tc ), coronal optical\ndepth (\u03c4c ), the temperature of the inner accretion disk\n(kTin ), and disk inclination angle (i). The model is implemented as a standard XSPEC table model (see Yao\net al. 2003 and Wang et al. 2004 for more details).\nWe fitted the CMCD model to the spectra of all the\nULXs. It was not possible to constrain the parameters\nfor all but one ULX source 26, due to poor signal-to-noise\nand/or best-fit parameters outside the tabulated ranges.\nDue to the contamination of the extended soft X-ray\nemission, source 26 statistically required two mekal components in addition to an absorbed CMCD model. The\naddition of the first and second mekal components improved the fit by \u2206C = \u2212491.1 and \u221219.1, respectively,\nfor three additional parameters in each case. The mekal\ntemperatures are similar to that derived earlier using the\ncombination of two mekal and a power law model. The\nbest-fit parameters are listed in Table 5. For the best-fit\nCMCD model, the inner disk temperature is 291+93\n\u221282 eV.\nThe disk inclination angle is poorly constrained.\n6. INDIVIDUAL ULX CHARACTERISTICS\n\nIn this section we describe the X-ray properties of individual ULXs.\n6.1. NGC 5194 source 5\nThis source is located in the western outer spiral arm of NGC 5194, coincident with the ROSAT\nHRI source 4 (Ehle et al. 1995). Chandra resolved\nthis source into two discrete sources NGC 5194#5\n(CXOM51 J132939.5+471244) and NGC 5194#6\n(CXOM51 J132940.0+471237).\nNGC 5194#5 is\nbrighter than NGC 5194#6 by factors of 1.5 and 11\nin the 0.5 \u2212 8 keV and 2 \u2212 8 keV bands, respectively\n(Terashima & Wilson 2004).\nOur XMM-Newton\nspectrum of this source requires a soft X-ray excess\ncomponent that is equally well described either by an\nMCD or a mekal component. This soft excess component\ncontributes \u223c 42% to the total flux in the 0.5 \u2212 2 keV.\nTherefore, the detection of soft X-ray excess emission\nabove the power-law component in the XMM-Newton\nspectrum could be due to the contamination of the\n\n\f7\nsofter NGC 5194#6 and the ULX spectrum is likely to\nbe a simple power-law.\n6.2. NGC 5194 source 9\nThis is the softest ULX in M 51 (see Fig. 1). This\nsource is coincident to the ROSAT HRI source 5 (Ehle\net al. 1995) and Chandra source NGC 5194#9 which was\na super-soft source (Terashima & Wilson 2004). Chandra detected no photons above 1 keV from NGC 5194\nsource 9 and its spectrum was well described by an\nMCD model with kT \u223c 100 eV. XMM-Newton EPIC\nMOS detected this source at 6\u03c3 and 3\u03c3 levels above\n1 keV and 2 keV, respectively. The MOS spectra of this\nsource statistically require three components: a powerlaw (\u0393 \u223c 1.4), an MCD (kT \u223c 130 eV), and a mekal\n(kT \u223c 340 eV). Alternatively, the MOS spectra can\nalso be described by a power law (\u0393 \u223c 1.6) and two\nmekal components (kT \u223c 80, 306 eV). The X-ray flux\nof source 5 was a factor of \u223c 3 higher during our XMMNewton observation than that during the Chandra observations. The soft X-ray excess (MCD + mekal) flux is\n7.4 \u00d7 10\u221214 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 in the 0.5 \u2212 8 keV band which\nis similar to the total flux observed by Chandra in June\n2001.\n6.3. NGC 5194 source 26\nThis is the nearest ULX to the LLAGN in NGC 5194.\nIt is located about 28\u2032\u2032 west of the LLAGN and its soft\nX-ray emission is heavily contaminated by extended soft\nemission. This source was not detected in the ROSAT\nHRI possibly due to the extended soft X-ray emission.\nThis ULX is brighter than the LLAGN in the 1.5\u221210 keV\nband (see Fig. 2). Chandra also detected this source as\nthe hardest ULX in M 51 (Terashima & Wilson 2004).\nIn the two Chandra observations, this source showed interesting spectral behavior. The first Chandra observation revealed an absorbed power-law spectrum and emission lines at \u223c 1.8 keV, 3.24 keV, \u223c 4.03 keV, and \u223c\n6.65 keV, most likely the K\u03b1 lines of Si, Ar, Ca, and Fe,\nrespectively (Terashima & Wilson 2004). In the second\nChandra observation, no emission lines were clearly detected although the source was brighter by \u223c 50%. The\nXMM-Newton spectra of this source are well described by\nan absorbed power-law (\u0393 \u223c 2.4, NH \u223c 7.1 \u00d7 1022 cm\u22122 )\nand two mekal components (kT \u223c 250 eV, \u223c 590 eV).\nThe absorbed power-law is consistent with that observed\nby the second Chandra observation. The two mekal components represent the contribution of the extended soft\nemission. We do not detect any emission lines except the\niron line or an edge. Future deep X-ray observations will\nestablish if the line is real. The EPIC PN spectrum of\nsource 26, after appropriately correcting for the contribution of extended emission, requires either a moderately\nbroad (\u03c3 \u223c 200 eV) iron K\u03b1 line or a strong iron K edge\nat \u223c 7.1 keV.\n6.4. NGC 5194 source 37\nThis source is coincident with a southern spiral arm\nof NGC 5194 that displays extended UV emission (see\nFig. 2). This source was not detected in the first Chandra\nobservation but was detected in the second observation\n(Terashima & Wilson 2004). During our XMM-Newton\nobservations, the ULX was \u223c 50% brighter than dur-\n\ning the second Chandra observation. The Chandra spectrum was described by a simple power law, while the\nXMM-Newton spectra statistically require a soft component that is equally well described by a mekal or an MCD\ncomponent, in addition to a power law. The power law is\nflatter (\u0393 = 0.8+0.4\n\u22120.5 ) than that derived from the Chandra\ndata (\u0393 = 1.55+0.19\n\u22120.15 ). It is likely that this discrepancy is\nattributable to the different number of spectral components used to describe the Chandra and XMM-Newton\nspectra.\n6.5. NGC 5194 source 41\n\nThis ULX is closer to the nucleus of NGC 5195 than\nto the nucleus of NGC 5194 but may be associated\nwith the outer edge of an outermost spiral arm to the\nnorth of the nucleus of NGC 5194. This source was\nalso detected in the ROSAT HRI (source 10 in Ehle\net al. 1995). Chandra resolved this source into two\nsources NGC 5194#41 (CXOM51 J132953.7+471436)\nand NGC 5194#42 (CXOM51 J132953.8+471432).\nNGC 5194#41 is a factor of \u223c 2 more luminous than\nNGC 5194#42. Remarkably, the XMM-Newton source is\nfainter by \u223c 50% than the Chandra source NGC 5194#41\nalone. Chandra spectra of this ULX are consistent with\neither a power-law or an MCD and no variability between the two observations. XMM-Newton spectra statistically require either an MCD (kT \u223c 270 eV) or a\nmekal (kT \u223c 340 eV) in addition to a power-law. Since\nthe Chandra source NGC 5194#42 is an absorbed source,\nthe thermal component inferred from the XMM-Newton\ndata is likely a genuine component.\n6.6. NGC 5194 source 63\nThis is faintest ULX in M 51 with a 0.5 \u2212 8 keV luminosity of \u223c 1039 erg s\u22121 . This source was fainter by a\nfactor of \u223c 2 in the 0.5 \u2212 8 keV band during the Chandra\nobservations and was not considered to be a ULX. We\nconsider this source to be a ULX at its increased flux.\nIt is possible that the source is a stellar mass black hole\naccreting at or near the Eddington rate. The ULX is\nlocated to the south-east region coincident with a spiral\narm, displaying extended UV emission. The X-ray spectrum of this source shows soft excess emission above a\npower law (\u0393 \u223c 2.0) and is statistically better described\nby a mekal plasma than an MCD. The presence of an\nextended UV source and optically thin thermal plasma\nboth suggest that this ULX may be associated with a region of strong star-formation or unusually X-ray bright\nsupernova remnant.\n6.7. NGC 5194 source 69\nThis ULX is well known for the tentative detection of\na 2.1 hr periodicity in its X-ray flux (Liu et al. 2002).\nIt is located in a region of extended soft X-ray emission\nand strong UV emission in an spiral arm to the northeast of the nucleus. The ULX is closer to the nucleus of\nNGC 5195 than to the nucleus of NGC 5194 but is clearly\nassociated with NGC 5194. This source was detected in\nthe ROSAT HRI (Ehle et al. 1995). The ULX showed\ndrastic long term X-ray variability, its 0.5 \u2212 8 keV luminosity declining by a factor of \u223c 75 from the first to the\nsecond Chandra observation. During our XMM-Newton\nobservation, the ULX had brightened by a factor of \u223c 50\n\n\f8\nin the 0.5 \u2212 8 keV band. Source 69 also shows variability\non short-times scales. The first Chandra observation tentatively detected two peaks separated by \u223c 7000 s. Liu\net al. (2002) interpreted these features as a 2.1 hr periodicity. The number of counts was too low to detect any\nsuch periodicity during the second Chandra observation.\nDuring a bright flux state during the XMM-Newton observation, the source again shows three possible peaks\nseparated this time by \u223c 6000 s. We detect a periodic signal at a significance level of 2\u03c3 with a period of\n5925\u00b1200 s from the EPIC light curves (see section 7.2.4\nfor further discussion). The XMM-Newton spectrum of\nthis source is well described by either of the following\nthree component models: (i) a power law (\u0393 \u223c 1.2) and\ntwo mekal components (kT \u223c 180 eV, 680 eV); (ii) a\npower law (\u0393 \u223c 1.2), an MCD (kT \u223c 170 eV), and a\nmekal (kT \u223c 690 eV).\n6.8. NGC 5194 source 82\nThis is the brightest ULX in M 51 with an observed\nluminosity of \u223c 2.2 \u00d7 1039 erg s\u22121 in the 0.5 \u2212 8 keV\nband. The ULX is coincident with an outer spiral arm\neast of the nucleus. This source was previously detected\nwith Einstein HRI (Palumbo et al. 1985), ROSAT HRI\n(source 14 in Ehle et al. 1995), BeppoSAX (Fukazawa et\nal. 2001), and Chandra (Terashima & Wilson 2004). The\nsource had dimmed in the second Chandra observation\nbut was brighter by 35% in the XMM-Newton observation, a level similar to that seen during the first Chandra\nobservation. Both Chandra and XMM-Newton spectra\nof this ULX are consistent with an absorbed power law.\n6.9. NGC 5195 source 12\n\nThis is the only ULX in NGC 5195 that is well separated from the nucleus. The ULX is \u223c 70\u2032\u2032 away to east\nof the nucleus. The ULX was earlier detected with the\nROSAT HRI (source 13 in Ehle et al. 1995). Source\n12 is the only ULX in M 51 to have X-ray spectrum\nthat is well described by a single spectral component either a simple power-law (\u0393 \u223c 1.6 \u00b1 0.2) or mekal plasma\n(kT \u223c 7.7 keV). The ULX is not resolved spatially with\nChandra. Modeling the spectrum as an optically thin\nplasma requires an unrealistically high temperature and,\nas a result, we prefer the non-thermal power-law interpretation despite the equally good spectral fits. The notable lack of an optical/UV counterpart for the source\nstrongly suggests that this source is not a background\nAGN, particularly given its low intrinsic X-ray absorption (NH \u223c 5.6 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 )\n7. DISCUSSION\n\nWe have performed the temporal and spectral analysis\nof the LLAGN and nine ULXs in M 51 using a XMMNewton observation. Below we discuss the main results\nobtained.\n7.1. The LLAGN of NGC 5194\nThe X-ray spectrum of the LLAGN is a typical of\nThomson-thick Seyfert 2 galaxies, namely an extremely\nflat continuum, a strong and narrow line from neutral\niron, and unabsorbed soft X-ray emission. Our spectral\nmodeling shows that the flat continuum can be described\nas the reflection of the primary power-law (\u0393 = 1.9) by\n\ncold and dense material, assuming the cold material subtends a 2\u03c0 solid angle to the central source, the luminosity of the primary continuum is then estimated to\nbe \u223c 1040 erg s\u22121 in the 0.3 \u2212 10 keV band. This luminosity is about two orders of magnitude lower than\nthat for Seyfert 1 galaxies, thus confirming the nucleus\nof NGC 5194 as an LLAGN as already established with\nprevious BeppoSAX and optical observations. Since the\nLLAGN is nearly Thomson thick, the soft X-ray emission\nin the spectrum must be associated with the extended\nsoft emission seen in Fig. 1.\n7.2. ULXs in M 51\nThere are nine ultra-luminous X-ray sources in M 51\n>\nwith the observed luminosity of \u223c\n1039 erg s\u22121 in the\n0.5 \u2212 8 keV band. Three ULXs, source 9, 41 and 63,\nwith LX \u223c 1039 erg s\u22121 (0.5 \u2212 8 keV) may actually be\nstellar mass black holes (\u223c 10 \u2212 20M\u2299 ). The brightest\nULX in M 51, source 82, has a 0.5 \u2212 8 keV luminosity of\n2.2 \u00d7 1039 erg s\u22121 , lower than the Eddington luminosity\n(\u2243 2.6 \u00d7 1039 erg s\u22121 ) for a 20 M\u2299 black hole. Thus, all\nULXs in M 51 could plausibly be stellar mass black holes\nat around (or slightly above) the Eddington limit.\nThe larger collecting area of XMM-Newton compared\nto Chandra has enabled us to investigate the nature of\nULXs in greater detail. While Chandra spectrum of individual ULXs in M 51 is well described by a single spectral component, XMM-Newton spectrum of most ULXs\nin NGC 5194 require at least two spectral components.\n7.2.1. Cool accretion disks\n\nX-ray spectra of two ULXs, sources 9 and 69, require\nsoft components, modeled by either mekal plus MCD or\ntwo mekal components. The MCD components suggest\ninner disk temperatures of kTin \u223c 130 eV (source 9) and\n\u223c 170 eV (source 69). These temperatures are lower\nthan that found for ULXs studied with ASCA (Makishima et al. 2000) and Galactic X-ray binaries, but\nare similar to that found for ULXs studied with XMMNewton (Miller et al. 2003; Miller, Fabian, & Miller 2004;\nDewangan et al. 2004). The XMM-Newton observation\nof M 51 supports the increasing trend that ULXs have\ncooler accretion disks than GBH binaries. The temperature of the innermost regions of an accretion disk is given\nby\n!1/4 \u0012\n\u00131/2 \u0010\n\u0013\u2212 14\n\u0012\n\u03ba \u0011 \u22121/2 \u1e40\nM\n\u03be\n\u03b1\nkTin \u2248 1.2 keV\n0.41\n1.7\n10 M\u2299\n\u1e40E\n(1)\n(see e.g., Makishima et al. 2000). Here \u03ba \u2243 1.7 is a\nspectral hardening factor. The factor \u03be \u2243 0.4 takes into\naccount the fact that the radius of maximum temperature is larger than the innermost stable orbit, and \u03b1 = 1\nfor a Schwarzschild geometry or 1/6 for a Kerr geometry.\nThus objects with lower MCD temperatures must have\neither higher black hole masses or lower accretion rates.\nAssuming a relative accretion rate of \u1e40\u1e40 \u223c 0.1, equaEdd\ntion 1 implies black hole masses of \u223c 7300M \u2299 (source\n9) and \u223c 2500M \u2299 (source 69).\nThe results of the CMCD model fit to the spectrum\nof source 26 suggests that this ULX has cool accretion\ndisk (kT = 291+13\n\u221282 eV). Using the normalization and the\n\n\f9\ninclination angle of CMCD model, it is possible to derive\na BH mass as detailed in Wang et al. (2004). Using this\nprocedure, we derive a black hole mass of \u223c 2800M \u2299 for\nthe ULX sources 26.\n7.2.2. ULXs with a power-law spectrum\n\nThe X-ray spectrum of two ULXs, source 82 and source\n12, can be described by a simple power-law models with\na photon indices of \u223c 2.4 and \u223c 1.7, respectively. Source\n12 does not show any signature of emission from an accretion disk. The power-law spectral form of this ULX is\nsimilar to that of XRBs in their low state (Terashoma &\nWilson 2004) or type 1 AGNs (excluding the narrow-line\nSeyfert 1 galaxies). If the above analogy is correct, then\nthe ULXs with simple power-law spectrum may imply\nvery high mass (> a few times 100M \u2299) black hole. A\npower-law spectrum may also result from beamed X-ray\nemission. The X-ray spectrum of source 82 is very steep\nand may be similar to that of Galactic XRBs in their very\nhigh state (see Terashima & Wilson 2004 and Roberts et\nal. 2004 for a detailed discussion on the power-law spectral form of ULXs). It is also possible that ULXs with a\nsimple power-law spectrum are background AGNs.\n7.2.3. Spectral variability\n\nIt is not possible to compare directly the best-fit spectral form derived from the Chandra and XMM-Newton\nobservations due to the different number of spectral components used to fit the spectra. Therefore, we compare\nthe best-fit model derived from the Chandra, usually\na single component model, and the corresponding single component model best-fit to the XMM-Newton data.\nThe single component model is not necessarily the bestfit model to the XMM-Newton data. Figure 11 compares\nthe spectral parameters illustrating the spectral variability of ULXs in M 51. The steeper spectrum of source 5\nduring the XMM-Newton observation may be due to the\ncontribution of the soft source NGC 5194#6 detected\nwith Chandra (see section 6.1). Source 9 shows a very\nsoft X-ray spectrum and is consistent with no spectral\nshape variability. The detection of the power law component in addition to the soft component in the spectra\nof source 9 may be due to the larger collecting area of\nXMM-Newton particularly at higher energies. Sources\n26, 37, 63 and 12 do not show significant variability in\ntheir spectral shape. Sources 41 and 82 show slightly\nsteeper X-ray spectra compared with the earlier Chandra observation.\nSource 69 continues to show drastic spectral and flux\nvariability. The source was in a high/hard state (power\n+1.0\nlaw \u0393 = 1.24+0.12\n\u22120.17 or MCD kT = 2.3\u22120.5 ) in June\n2000 and subsequently made a transition to an extremely soft/low state (power law \u0393 > 5.1 or MCD\nkT = 0.17+0.13\n\u22120.06 ) in June 2001 (Terashima & Wilson\n2004). The ULX made another transition back to a state\nsimilar to its earlier high/hard state, in January 2003.\nThe spectral transitions of source 69 are completely different from the high/soft to low/hard spectral transitions\nusually observed from Galactic XRBs but similar to those\nobserved from some ULXs (The Antennae, Fabbiano et\nal. 2003; Holmberg II X-1, Dewangan et al. 2004; an\nULX in NGC 7714, Soria & Motch 2004). The ULXs\nthat show distinct spectral transitions may a comprise a\n\ndistinct class of ULXs. The physics of these transitions\nis yet to be understood clearly.\n7.2.4. Periodicity\n\nSource 69 is the only ULX in M 51 that shows indications for a possible periodic variations in its X-ray flux.\nThe periods detected from our XMM-Newton observation\n(P = 5925 \u00b1 200 s at a \u223c 2\u03c3 level) and the first Chandra\nobservation (P = 7620\u00b1500 s) are significantly different.\nThe two observations are separated by \u223c 1.5 yrs. The\nvariation in period, if real, clearly argues against orbital\nperiodicity, and suggests the presence of quasi-periodic\noscillations. Liu et al. (2002) discussed the possibility\nthat the observed periodicity is due to orbital variations\nand as noted by Liu et al. (2002), only low mass X-ray\nbinaries (LMXBs) can have orbital periods as small as\n2 hr with high luminosities. In this case Liu et al. (2002)\nestimate the mass of the donor to be \u2243 0.23M \u2299. The\nspectrum of source 69 derived from the first Chandra observation was found to be consistent with an absorbed\nmulticolor disk model with inner disk temperature of\nkT = 2.10+0.63\n\u22120.40 keV and showed marginal improvement\nin the fit after including a single temperature blackbody\ncomponent. Based on these results, Liu et al. (2002) do\nnot rule out the possibility that source 69 is a neutron\nstar. Our XMM-Newton spectra require three components - a power-law (\u0393 \u223c 1.2), a mekal (kT \u223c 680 eV)\nand another mekal (kT \u223c 180 eV) or a cool accretion\ndisk (kTin \u223c 170 eV). The stellar mass black hole systems and high luminosity neutron star binary systems,\nboth have high disk temperatures (kT = 1\u22122 keV). The\npossible variation in the period, due to a QPO and the\nX-ray spectrum both are inconsistent with the LMXB\npicture. Moreover, source 69 resides in a region that is\nlikely to be undergoing active star formation, making it\nlikely that the ULX is a high mass X-ray binary (HMXB).\nThe spectral transition of source 69 from a high-hard to\nlow-soft state also is in disagreement with the behavior\nof most Galactic LMXBs (Terashima & Wilson 2004).\nIf we interpret the variation of the apparent periodicity as resulting from QPOs, then QPO frequency\nof \u223c 0.15mHz is much lower than 67mHz QPO observed with RXTE from the Galactic black hole candidate GRS 1915+105, which has a dynamically measured mass of 14 \u00b1 4M \u2299 (Morgan, Remillard & Grener\n1997). The only ULX known to show QPO is M 82 X-1\n(Strohmayer & Mushotzky 2003). Its QPO frequency of\n54mHz is also lower than that of GRS 1915+105 but\nmuch larger than the implied frequency for source 69. It\nis not necessary the case that QPO frequency scales with\nthe mass of the black hole, only twin peak QPOs with a\nfrequency ratio of 3:2 have been established to scale with\nblack hole mass (McClintock & Remillard 2003). The\nmicro-quasar GRS 1915+105 is known to show QPOs at\nkHz as well as mHz frequencies, the lowest frequency of\nQPO observed from GRS 1915+105 is 1.6 mHz (Morgan\net al. 1997). Therefore it is not entirely unlikely the\npossibility of a \u223c 0.15 mHz QPO from source 69. Long\nobservations are required to clarify the presence of periodicity or QPO in this ULX.\n8. CONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have analyzed XMM-Newton EPIC observation of\nM 51 performed in January 2003. Our main findings are\n\n\f10\nis about a factor four stronger than the surrounding\ndiffuse emission and is likely intrinsic to the ULX.\n\nas follows:\n\u2022 We detected 9 ULXs, an LLAGN and extended soft\nthermal emission from M 51. One of the sources\n(source 63) is a new ULX, not identified earlier due\nto its previously faint flux levels.\n\u2022 All eight ULXs in NGC 5194 are located in or near\nspiral arms. Four ULXs are located in the regions\nof strong UV emission in the spiral arms, suggesting association of these ULXs with current star formation.\n\u2022 Two ULXs (sources 26 and 69) show evidence\nfor short-term variability. Source 69 is the most\nrapidly variable ULX in M 51 and shows a possible period of \u223c 5925 s. All the ULXs except\nNGC 5194#12, show long-term variability by a factors of few to several.\n\u2022 Most ULXs in M 51 show soft X-ray excess emission, above a hard power law, that is modeled by\na mekal plasma and/or an MCD component. However the strength of the soft excess emission inferred from an ULX is comparable to the diffuse\nemission around individual ULXs excluding source\n69. Thus the soft excess emission is unlikely to be\nphysically associated with any of the ULXs except\nsource 69. The soft excess emission from source 69\n\n\u2022 There is an indication of either a moderately broad\n(\u03c3 = 100 eV) iron K\u03b1 line or an iron K absorption\nedge both due to neutral iron in the spectrum of\nsource 26.\n\u2022 The X-ray spectrum of LLAGN in NGC 5194 is\nextremely flat (\u0393 \u223c 0.7) and shows a strong (EW\u223c\n2.5 keV), narrow, iron line from neutral material.\nThe X-ray emission from the LLAGN in NGC 5194\nis dominated by reflection from cold material.\n\nWe are grateful to an anonymous referee for the valuable comments and suggestions that improved the paper.
