Introduction\n\nIn physics, theoretical predictions of new experimental results rely mainly on the\nmathematical structure of the relevant theory. In this sense, the activity in theoretical\nphysics is analogous to that of mathematics. However, unlike problems belonging\nto the realm of mathematical investigation, there are physical problems where the\ntheoretical analysis cannot proceed without a knowledge of some experimental data\nthat describe specific properties of the system. These two elements are used below in\nan explanation of the possibility that the data which will be obtained from CERN's\nLarge Hadron Collider (LHC) may show a significant increase of the cross section for\nregions of very high energy that have not been explored before.\n\n2. The Experimental Data\n\nPreliminary results of the experimental data needed for the analysis have been\nreported nearly 10 years ago [1,2]. These experiments have been carried out at HERA\nand use e+ p colliding beams. Both H1 and ZEUS experiments show a significant\nexcess of the number of events for regions where Q2 > T GeV2 . Here Q2 is the absolute\nvalue of the squared 4-momentum transferred in the interaction and T denotes the\nthreshold used, which is 15000, 35000 GeV2 , respectively. The validity of this result\nis crucial for the discussion carried out below. The main problem with the data\nreported in [1,2] is the small number of events found in the analysis. Thus, different\nanalyses use different cuts of the kinematic region and the number of events found\nranges between 2 and 12 [1,2]. Hence, more data are needed.\nFurther publications that use a larger set of data obtained from the HERA facility\nhave been published since then. It turns out that recent publications [3,4] which rely\n2\n\n\fon all the relevant HERA data still leave this issue undecided. Thus, unlike the first\npublications that use Q2 as a parameter for grouping the data, the new analyses use\nthe value of the transverse momentum pT . (In the latter calculations the contribution\nof the longitudinal component of Q2 is lost and it becomes more difficult to detect\nevents restricted to very high Q2 .) The recent analyses [3,4] show that the two HERA\ngroups, H1 and ZEUS, do not agree now on the issue described above and that the\nexcess of the number of events found is still too small.\nThis state of affairs explains why today it is not clear whether or not there is a\nsignificant increase of the cross section for events where Q2 is very high.\nThe foregoing discussion explains why the following statement takes the status\nof a conjecture.\nA. The increase of the cross section reported in [1,2] is just the tip of the iceberg.\nA significant increase will be found in the data of more energetic interactions.\nHenceforth, this statement is called conjecture A. It is explained why also the\ntheoretical analysis carried out below indicates that several alternatives are possible\nand that conjecture A is consistent with one of them.\nThe HERA facility contains a beam of protons that collide with a beam of leptons.\nThe leptonic beam is made of electrons or positrons. In the theoretical analysis\ndescribed below it is explained why results of the proton-proton LHC facility are\nrelevant to the problem presented above.\n\n3. A Theoretical Discussion\n\nThe theory used herein is the Regular Charge-Monopole Theory (RCMT) [5,6]\nand its application to strong interactions [7]. Let us begin with a brief description\n3\n\n\fof relevant properties of RCMT. As usual, the term \"monopole\" is used sometimes\ninstead of \"magnetic charge\". Thus, monopoles are defined by the following duality\ntransformation (called also duality rotation by \u03c0/2)\nE \u2192 B,\n\nB \u2192 \u2212E\n\n(1)\n\nand\ne \u2192 g, g \u2192 \u2212e,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere g denotes the magnetic charge of monopoles.\nThe structure of RCMT [5,6] conserves the duality relations between two electromagnetic theories: the theory of electromagnetic fields and a matter carrying electric\ncharge (and no magnetic charge) - namely, the ordinary Maxwellian electrodynamics\nand the corresponding theory of fields and a matter carrying magnetic charge (and no\nelectric charge). Duality conservation is consistent with a self-evident requirement imposed on a monopole theory. RCMT is the union of these subtheories which conserves\nthe form of the charge-monopole duality relations. This theory can be derived from\na regular Lagrangian density. Hence, the corresponding quantum mechanical theory\ncan be constructed in a straightforward manner. The main result of RCMT can be\nput in the following words: Charges do not interact with bound fields of monopoles\nand monopoles do not interact with bound fields of charges. Charges interact with\nall fields of charges and with radiation fields emitted from monopoles. Monopoles\ninteract with all fields of monopoles and with radiation fields emitted from charges.\nAnother important result of RCMT is that the unit of the elementary magnetic charge\ng is a free parameter. However, hadronic data indicate that this unit is much larger\nthan that of the electric charge. More details of RCMT can be found in [5-7].\nThese properties of RCMT fit like a glove the data of electromagnetic projectiles\ninteracting with nucleons (see [7], pp. 90, 91). Thus, protons and neutrons do not\nlook alike in cases of charged lepton scattering whereas they look very similar if the\n4\n\n\fprojectile is a hard enough photon [8]. It is also shown [7,9,10] that an application of\nRCMT provides explanation for other physical properties in general and for hadronic\nproperties in particular. Thus, explanations are obtained for the following properties:\nthe reason why magnetic monopoles have not been detected in our instruments; the\nuniform density of nuclear matter; the fact that a system of six valence quarks is a\ndeuteron, which is a proton-neutron loosely bound state; the fact that strongly bound\nstates of pentaquarks do not exist; the reason why antiquarks of nucleons occupy a\nlarger spatial volume than that of quarks; the EMC effect [11,12] which shows that\nin a nucleus, the volume of a single quark increases together with the increase of the\nnucleon number A.\nThese results encourage one to continue the examination of the relevance of\nRCMT to the baryonic structure. The main baryonic property inferred from RCMT is\nthat baryons have a core whose magnetic charge is 3g and each quark has one negative\nunit of magnetic charge \u2212g. Therefore, baryons are neutral with respect to magnetic\ncharge. (The existence of a baryonic core is consistent with the portion of momentum\nof a very energetic nucleon, which is carried by quarks [13].) At this point, RCMT\ncan say nothing more on the structure of the baryonic core. In particular, it is not\nclear whether the core is an elementary structureless object or a complicated system\nwhich contains closed shells of quarks. However, the following arguments support the\nsecond alternative:\n\u2022 An elementary structureless baryonic core is certainly a simpler object than a\ncore which contains closed shells of quarks. Thus, if one does not expect to find\nthat Nature is too simple then he should be ready to realize that the baryonic\ncore has closed shells of quarks.\n\u2022 Here a comparison of atomic size with that of the nucleon and of the \u03c0 meson\nprovides another hint. The size of the radial variable of the positronium's\n5\n\n\fground state is very nearly two times larger than that of the hydrogen atom\nground state. However, for the hydrogen atom the classical meaning of this\nvariable represents the Bohr atomic radius r = 0.53 \u00c5. On the other hand, in\nthe case of the positronium it represents the diameter of the system. Thus, one\nconcludes that the geometrical size of the positronium's ground state is roughly\nthe same as that of the hydrogen atom.\nNow let us examine the helium atom. Here the strength of the Coulomb attraction of the nucleus is twice as large as that of the hydrogen atom and the Pauli\nexclusion principle allows the two electrons to be in the lowest orbital. Thus,\ndue to the stronger attraction of the nucleus, one finds that the radius of the\nground state of the helium atom, r = 0.31 \u00c5, is considerably smaller than that\nof the corresponding state of the hydrogen atom and of the positronium as well.\nLet us turn to the corresponding hadronic data and examine the \u03c0 meson and\nthe proton. Here the \u03c0 meson, which consists of a q\u0304q pair, corresponds to the\npositronium's ground state. In the case of the proton, we have uud quarks and\nthe Pauli exclusion principle allows all these quarks to be in the lowest empty\norbital. Thus, if the analogy with the atomic data mentioned above is relevant\nto this case then one expects that the size of the proton should be considerably\nsmaller than that of the \u03c0 meson. The experimental data is inconsistent with\nthis expectation and the effective radius of the \u03c0 meson is smaller than that of\nthe proton r\u03c0 \u2243 0.8 rp .\nThese experimental data can be interpreted as follows. The proton (as well\nas all other baryons) has a core charged with monopole units and inner closed\nshells of quarks. The net monopole units of the core and the closed shells of\nquarks is +3 and it attracts the three valence quarks. The entire system is\nneutral with respect to magnetic monopole charge. Since the orbitals of the\n6\n\n\fthree valence quarks are orthogonal to those of the closed shells, the former are\npushed outwards. This effect explains the rather large geometrical size of the\nproton.\nFollowing these arguments, it is assumed here that\nB. Baryons have a core which contains closed shells of quarks.\nClearly, the previous statement is a conjecture which is called below conjecture B.\nThe following discussion shows how conjecture B can explain conjecture A.\nAs of today, the energies used in collisions which involve nucleons are analyzed by\nthe interaction of the valence quarks and the associated q\u0304q pairs [13]. Now, according\nto conjecture B, the closed shells of quarks at the baryonic core make a quantum\nmechanical bound system. Thus, in cases of interactions with projectiles having a\nrelatively low energy, the baryonic core behaves like an inert object. On the other\nhand, interactions that involve a high enough energy may excite quarks of the baryonic\ncore. This scenario is analogous to the effect demonstrated by the Franck-Hertz\nexperiment which is known for more than 90 years [14]. Thus, if the projectile has\nenough energy then quarks of the outer closed shell of the baryonic core begin to\nparticipate in the scattering process. The contribution of the new participants should\nincrease the number of events.\nNow, interactions of the projectiles with the three valence quarks (and with the\nadditional q\u0304q) explain the data of the lower Q2 part of the HERA experiments whereas\nan excess of events is found for the higher Q2 values [1,2]. According to conjecture A,\nthis effect is significant. Thus, these reports indicate that the energies of the HERA\nfacility are just above the threshold of the energy required for exciting quarks of the\nclosed baryonic shells. Evidently, due to phase space consideration, one expects that\nthe excess of the number of events will be more significant for energies which are\n7\n\n\fhigher than those of the HERA facility.\n\n4. Concluding Remarks\n\nThe theoretical analysis of the previous Section examines the conditions required\nfor the excitation of the closed shells of quarks belonging to the baryonic core. Therefore, it is relevant to scattering processes that include baryons. For this reason, the\ndata obtained from the electron-positron CERN's LEP collider cannot cast light on\nthis problem. Similarly, the TEVATRON proton-antiproton collider cannot be used\nfor this purpose. Indeed, by definition, in a particle-antiparticle collision, all constituents participate in the mutual annihilation. This property is independent of the\ncollision energy. It follows that the quark analog of the Franck-Hertz effect cannot\nbe seen in this case. Restricting the discussion to facilities that have been used till\nnow, one finds that the HERA facility is the sole source of data required for a confirmation of conjecture B of Section 3. The HERA data provide us with no more than\na hint indicating that for higher energies, the excess of the number of events may be\nsignificant [1,2]. This hint enables one to make conjecture A of Section 2.\nThe operation of the LHC will yield data of proton-proton collisions at very high\nenergy. This experiment differs from those of HERA, where a proton collides with\nan electron (positron). However, if conjectures A, B hold then the analogue of the\nFranck-Hertz effect of the closed shells of quarks should be seen in the LHC data.\nAt the time when this work is finished the LHC has not yet begun to work.\nHence, at present, it is still not known whether its data will support conjecture A.\nAs explained in the previous Section, an experimental verification of conjecture A\nsupports conjecture B stating that the baryonic core contains closed shells of quarks.\nThree different kinds of explanation can be used for a case where the LHC data\n8\n\n\fwill not support this prediction: the regular charge-monopole theory is irrelevant to\nbaryons; the baryonic core is an elementary structureless object which contains no\nclosed shells of quarks; closed shells of the baryonic core exist but the LHC energy is\nlower than the threshold required for their excitation. Let us wait and see.\n\n9\n\n\fReferences:\n* Email: elic@tauphy.tau.ac.il\nInternet site: http://www-nuclear.tau.ac.il/\u223celic\n[1] C. Adloff et al., Z. Phys C74, 191 (1997).\n[2] J.
