Introduction\nWe briefly present the necessary background for locally conformally K\u00e4hler (in short,\nLCK) geometry.\nIn the sequel, J will denote an integrable complex structure on a connected, smooth\nmanifold M 2n of complex dimension n \u2265 2. For a Hermitian metric g on (M, J), we\ndenote by \u2207g its Levi-Civita connection and by \u03c9 its fundamental two-form \u03c9(X, Y ) :=\ng(JX, Y ).\nTraditionally, a LCK metric g on the complex manifold (M, J) is defined by the\nfollowing \"integrability\" condition satisfied by its fundamental two-form:\nd\u03c9 = \u03b8 \u2227 \u03c9,\n\nd\u03b8 = 0.\n\n(1)\n\nThe closed one-form \u03b8 is called the Lee form. Note that, on manifolds of complex\ndimension at least 3, the first equation implies the closedness of \u03b8, the second condition\nbeing relevant only on complex surfaces.\nAny other Hermitian metric ef g which is conformal with g is a LCK metric too, its\nLee form being \u03b8 + df . Hence, a LCK metric determines a 1-cocycle associated merely\nto the conformal class c = [g].\nThis work was accomplished in the framework of the Associated European Laboratory \"MathMode\".\nL.O. is partially supported by CNCSIS PNII grant code 8.\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nANDREI MOROIANU AND LIVIU ORNEA\n\nClearly, on local open sets on which \u03b8 is exact, g is conformal with some local K\u00e4hler\nmetrics which, on overlaps, are homothetic. The above 1-cocycle is associated to this\nsystem of scale factors.\nNote that on the universal cover of M, the pull-back of \u03b8 is exact (the pull-backs of\nthe local K\u00e4hler metrics glue together to a global K\u00e4hler metric) and the fundamental\ngroup of M acts by biholomorphic homotheties with respect to this K\u00e4hler metric. This\nis usually taken for definition of a LCK manifold.\nReturning on M, the Levi-Civita connection D U of a local K\u00e4hler metric in the\nconformal class of g on some open set U is related to the Levi-Civita connection of g\nby the formula:\n1\nD U = \u2207g \u2212 (\u03b8 \u2297 id + id \u2297 \u03b8 \u2212 g \u2297 \u03b8\u266f ).\n(2)\n2\nIt is obvious that, in fact, these connections do not depend on the particular local K\u00e4hler\nmetric, i.e. they glue together to a global connection, here denoted D, which has the\nfollowing two properties:\nDJ = 0,\n\nDg = \u03b8 \u2297 g.\n\nThe second equation implies that D preserves the conformal class: Dc = 0. Being\ntorsion free (as, locally, any Levi-Civita connection), it is a Weyl connection. Notice\nthat the Lee form of the Weyl connection D with respect to g defined by (2) coincides\nwith the Lee form of the complex structure J with respect to g defined by (1).\nDefinition 1.1. A Hermitian-Weyl structure on M 2n is a triple (c, J, D) where c is\na conformal structure, J is a complex structure compatible with c and D is a Weyl\nconnection such that DJ = 0 and Dc = 0.\nFrom the above, every LCK structure defines a Hermitian-Weyl structure on M, and\nconversely, every metric in the conformal class of a Hermitian-Weyl structure is LCK,\nprovided n \u2265 3. Notice that the Weyl connection D is uniquely defined by J (see e.g.\n[2, Lemma 5.1]). We call D the minimal Weyl connection.\nIn general, there is no way to choose a \"canonical\" metric in the conformal class\nof a Hermitian-Weyl manifold (M, c, J, D), unless M is compact, where there exists a\nunique, up to homothety, metric g0 in c such that the Lee form \u03b80 of D with respect\nto g0 is co-closed (and hence harmonic), see [5, p.502]. We call g0 the the Gauduchon\nmetric.\nA particular class of LCK manifolds are the Vaisman manifolds. These are defined\nby the condition \u2207g \u03b8 = 0. By the uniqueness up to homotheties, a Vaisman metric\nis, necessarily, the Gauduchon metric in its conformal class. The prototype of Vaisman\nmanifolds are the Hopf manifolds Cn \\ {0}/Z, with Z generated by a semi-simple endomorphism (see [10] for the structure of compact Vaisman manifolds). On the other\nhand, there exist examples of compact LCK manifolds which do not admit any Vaisman\nmetric: such are the Inoue surfaces and the non-diagonal Hopf surfaces, see [1].\n\n\fTRANSFORMATIONS OF LOCALLY CONFORMALLY K\u00c4HLER MANIFOLDS\n\n3\n\nThe hypercomplex version of LCK geometry is straightforward. One starts with a\nhypercomplex manifold (M, I, J, K) endowed with a conformal class [c] and with a Weyl\nconnection D satisfying:\nDc = 0,\n\nDI = DJ = DK = 0.\n\nOne obtains the notion of hyperhermitian-Weyl structure. It can be seen that for any g \u2208\nc, the Lee forms associated to the three complex structures coincide. As above, the Lee\nform is closed in real dimension at least 8, and hence, with the exception of dimension\n4, a hyperhermitian-Weyl manifold is locally conformally hyperk\u00e4hler (LCHK).\nThe local K\u00e4hler metrics of a LCHK manifold are now hyperk\u00e4hler, hence Ricciflat. It follows that LCHK manifolds are necessarily Einstein-Weyl. But on compact\nEinstein-Weyl manifolds, the Gauduchon metric is parallel, see [6]. Hence, a compact\nLCHK manifold bears three nested Vaisman structures.\nFor examples and properties of LCK and LCHK manifolds, we refer to [3], to more\nrecent papers by Ornea and Verbitsky and to the references therein.\nRemark 1.2. In the whole paper, we tacitly assume that the manifolds we consider\nare not globally conformally K\u00e4hler, i.e. the Lee form is never exact. This is especially\nimportant on compact manifolds, where LCK and K\u00e4hler structures impose completely\ndifferent topologies.\nWe now consider the following transformation groups on a Hermitian-Weyl manifold\n(M, c, J, D):\n\u2022 Aff(M, D), the group of affine transformations, i.e. preserving the Weyl connection.\n\u2022 H(M, J), the group of biholomorphisms with respect to J.\n\u2022 Conf(M, c), the group of conformal transformations.\n\u2022 Aut(M):= Hol(M, J) \u2229 Conf(M, c), the group of automorphisms.\nIt is well known that these are Lie groups. Their Lie algebras will be denoted,\nrespectively by: aff(M, D), h(M, J), conf(M, c), aut(M).\nOn Vaisman manifolds, the Lee field \u03b8\u266f is Killing and real-analytic but on non-Vaisman\nLCK manifolds, almost no information about these groups is available. It is the purpose\nof this note to clarify some relations among the above groups. Essentially, we prove that:\n\u2022 aff(M, D) = aut(M), provided that Hol0 (D) is irreducible and M is not LCHK\n(Corollary 2.3).\n\u2022 conf(M, c) = aut(M) on compact Vaisman manifolds which are neither LCHK\nnor diagonal Hopf manifolds (Theorem 3.2).\nNote that on compact LCHK manifolds and on Hopf manifolds there exist examples\nof affine transformations which are not holomorphic, see Remark 2.4 (ii) below.\nWe believe that the second equality holds on all compact LCK manifolds which are\nneither LCHK nor diagonal Hopf manifolds. By Lemma 2.5 below, this amounts to\n\n\f4\n\nANDREI MOROIANU AND LIVIU ORNEA\n\nprove that every conformal vector field is Killing for the Gauduchon metric, which is\nthe LCK counterpart of the result saying that every conformal vector field on a compact\nK\u00e4hler manifold is Killing ([8, \u00a790]).\n2. Affine vector fields on LCK manifolds\nOur first result is the LCK analogue of [8, \u00a754], (see also [7]).\nLemma 2.1. Let (M, c, J, D) be a LCK manifold which is not locally conformally hyperk\u00e4hler and such that Hol0 (D) is irreducible. Then any f \u2208 Aff(M, D) is holomorphic\nor anti-holomorphic.\nProof. Let f \u2208 Aff(M, D) and let Jx\u2032 := (dx f )\u22121 \u25e6 Jf (x) \u25e6 (dx f ) denote the image by f of\nthe complex structure J. Then J \u2032 2 = \u2212id and, as J and df commute with the parallel\ntransport induced by D, we easily derive that J \u2032 is D-parallel too.\nConsider the decomposition of JJ \u2032 into symmetric and skew-symmetric parts: JJ \u2032 =\nS + A, where\n(\nS := 21 (JJ \u2032 + J \u2032 J),\nA := 21 (JJ \u2032 \u2212 J \u2032 J).\nSince S is D-parallel, its eigenvalues are constant and the corresponding eigenbundles are\nD-parallel. The irreducibility assumption implies S = kid for some k \u2208 R. Similarly, the\nD-parallel symmetric endomorphism A2 has to be a multiple of the identity: A2 = pid.\nIf A were non-zero, A(X) 6= 0 for some X \u2208 T M, so\n\n0 > \u2212c(AX, AX) = c(A2 X, X) = pc(X, X),\n\u221a\nwhence p < 0. The endomorphism K := A/ \u2212p is then a D-parallel complex structure\nand satisfies KJ = \u2212JK, so (J, K) defines a LCHK structure on (M, c), which is\nforbidden by the hypothesis. Thus A = 0 and JJ \u2032 = kid, so J \u2032 = \u2212kJ. Using\nJ \u2032 2 = \u2212id we get k = \u00b11, so J \u2032 = \u00b1J, which just means that f is holomorphic or\nanti-holomorphic.\n\u0003\nIn a similar manner one can prove the following\nLemma 2.2. Let (M, c, J, D) be a LCK manifold such that Hol0 (D) is irreducible. Then\nany f \u2208 Aff(M, D) is conformal.\nProof. Since f is affine, the pull-back by f of the conformal structure c is a D-parallel\nconformal structure c\u2032 . The symmetric endomorphism B of T M defined by c\u2032 (X, Y ) =\nc(BX, Y ) is D-parallel. The irreducibility of Hol0 (D) shows as before that B is a\nmultiple of the identity.\n\u0003\n\n\fTRANSFORMATIONS OF LOCALLY CONFORMALLY K\u00c4HLER MANIFOLDS\n\n5\n\nCorollary 2.3. Let (M, c, J, D) be a LCK manifold which is not LCHK and such that\nHol0 (D) is irreducible. Then any infinitesimal affine transformation of the Weyl connection is an infinitesimal automorphism, i.e. aff(M, D) = aut(M).\nRemark 2.4. (i) We do not know whether the assumption of irreducibility of the\nWeyl connection can be relaxed or not, at least on compact M. But we can show\nthat a compact Vaisman manifold, which is not a (diagonal) Hopf manifold, is Weylirreducible. Indeed, by the structure theorem in [10], M is a mapping torus of a Sasakian\nisometry and its universal cover is a K\u00e4hlerian cone over the compact, hence complete,\nSasakian fibre. Then, as D is, locally, the Levi-Civita connection of the local K\u00e4hler\nmetrics, if D is reducible, the K\u00e4hler metric of the covering cone is reducible. Now, by\nProposition 3.1 in [4], a cone over a complete manifold is reducible if and only if it is\nflat. But a flat cone is the cone over a sphere, hence M is a Hopf manifold.\n(ii) Let W be a 3-Sasakian manifold. Then M := W \u00d7 S 1 is LCHK (for W = S 2n\u22121 ,\nM is a Hopf manifold) and each of the three Killing fields on W which generate the\nSU(2) action, induce Killing, hence affine with respect to the Weyl connection, fields\non M and each of them is holomorphic only with respect to one of the three complex\nstructures (see e.g. [3, Chapter 11]).\nWe apply the above to prove:\nLemma 2.5. Let (M, c, J, D) be a compact LCK manifold which is not LCHK and such\nthat Hol0 (D) is irreducible. Then every Killing vector field \u03be of the Gauduchon metric\nis a holomorphic vector field.\nProof. According to Corollary 2.3, it is enough to prove that \u03be is affine. As the Weyl\nconnection is uniquely defined by the Gauduchon metric and its Lee form \u03b80 , it will be\nenough to show that\nL\u03be \u03b80 = 0.\n(3)\nBut, as \u03be is g0 -Killing, the codifferential \u03b4 of g0 commutes with L\u03be , hence \u03b4(L\u03be \u03b80 ) =\nL\u03be (\u03b4\u03b80 ) = 0, because \u03b80 is co-exact. Now, \u03b80 is closed, so d(L\u03be \u03b80 ) = 0, i.e. L\u03be \u03b80 is\nharmonic. On the other hand, by Cartan's formula, L\u03be \u03b80 = d(\u03be y \u03b80 ). On a compact\nRiemannian manifold, a one-form which is both exact and harmonic necessarily vanishes,\nso (3) is proved.\n\u0003\n3. Conformal vector fields on Vaisman manifolds\nAs mentioned in the introduction, every conformal vector field on a compact K\u00e4hler\nmanifold is Killing ([8, \u00a790]). We consider the LCK analogue of this statement: Is\nevery conformal vector field on a compact LCK manifold Killing with respect to the\nGauduchon metric?\nAs no sphere S 2n can bear an LCK metric for n \u2265 2 (S 2n being simply connected,\nsuch a structure would be automatically K\u00e4hler), by Obata's theorem we derive that\nany conformal vector field on a compact LCK manifold is Killing for some metric in the\n\n\f6\n\nANDREI MOROIANU AND LIVIU ORNEA\n\ngiven conformal class, but not necessarily the Gauduchon metric. In fact, an argument\nentirely similar to the above, shows that a conformal vector field is Killing with respect\nto the Gauduchon metric if and only if it preserves the Lee form of the metric with\nrespect to which it is Killing.\nThe answer to the above question is not known to us in general. Nevertheless, we\ncan show that it holds on compact Vaisman manifolds, on which every conformal field\nis Killing with respect to the Gauduchon metric. This, actually, follows from a more\ngeneral statement:\nTheorem 3.1. Let \u03c6 be an isometry of a compact Riemannian manifold (W, h) and let\n(M, g) := (W, h) \u00d7 R/{(x,t)\u223c(\u03c6(x),t+1)} be the mapping torus of \u03c6. Then every conformal\nvector field on (M, g) is Killing.\nProof. In [9] it is shown that every twistor form on a Riemannian product is defined by\nKilling forms on the factors. We adapt the argument there to the situation of mapping\ntori.\nEvery conformal vector field on (M, g) induces a conformal vector field denoted \u03be on\nthe covering space W \u00d7 R of M, endowed with the product metric g\u0303 := h + dt2 . We\nwrite \u03be as\n\u03be = a\u2202t + \u03b7,\nwhere \u2202t = \u2202/\u2202t, \u03b7 is tangent to W and a is a function. Both a and \u03b7 can be viewed\nas objects on W indexed upon the parameter t on R. Since \u03be is invariant under the\nisometry (x, t) 7\u2192 (\u03c6(x), t + 1) of W \u00d7 R, we get in particular a(w, t) = a(\u03c6(w), t + 1),\nand thus, if we write at (w) for a(w, t),\nat = \u03c6\u2217 at+1 ,\n\n\u0227t = \u03c6\u2217 \u0227t+1 ,\n\n\u2200 (w, t) \u2208 W \u00d7 R.\n\n(4)\n\nNow, \u03be being conformal, there exists a function f on W \u00d7 R such that L\u03be g\u0303 = f g\u0303. This\ncan be written\ng\u0303(\u2207A \u03be, B) + g\u0303(A, \u2207B \u03be) = f g\u0303(A, B)\n(5)\nfor every tangent vectors to W \u00d7 R, A and B. Taking A = B = \u2202t in (5) gives\nf = 2g\u0303(\u2207\u2202t \u03be, \u2202t ),\nhence, by the parallelism of \u2202t , one has\nf = 2\u2202t (a) = 2\u0227.\n\n(6)\n\nApplying the same equation (5) on pairs (\u2202t , X), (Y, Z), with X, Y, Z tangent to W and\nindependent on t, we obtain, respectively:\n\u2207\u2202t \u03b7 + da = 0,\nand\nh(\u2207Y \u03b7, Z) + h(Y, \u2207Z \u03b7) = f h(Y, Z).\n\n\fTRANSFORMATIONS OF LOCALLY CONFORMALLY K\u00c4HLER MANIFOLDS\n\n7\n\nNotice that here da denotes the exterior derivative of a on W and should be understood\nas a family of 1-forms on W indexed on t, identified by h with a family of vector fields\non W . Taking (6) into account, the two equations above become:\n(\n\u03b7\u0307 = \u2212da,\n(7)\nW\nh(\u2207W\nY \u03b7, Z) + h(Y, \u2207Z \u03b7) = 2\u0227h(Y, Z)\nAs the vector fields Y, Z are independent on t, we can take the derivative with respect\nto t in the second equation of (7):\nW\nh(\u2207W\nY \u03b7\u0307, Z) + h(Y, \u2207Z \u03b7\u0307) = 2\u00e4h(Y, Z).\n\nLetting here Y = Z = Ei , where {Ei } is a local orthonormal basis on W , we obtain\n\u03b4 W \u03b7\u0307 = \u2212m\u00e4,\n\n(m = dim W ).\n\nUsing the first equation in (7), we finally obtain:\n\u03b4 W da = m\u00e4.\n\n(8)\n\nWe use this equation to show that a is constant. To this end, we integrate kdak2 on W :\nZ\nZ\nZ\nZ\nZ\nW\n\u2032\nh(da, da) =\n(\u03b4 da)a = m\na\u00e4 = m\n(a\u0227) \u2212 m\n(\u0227)2 .\nW\n\nW\n\nW\n\nW\n\nW\n\nIf we let b := ma\u0227, then, from the above equation we have\nZ\nZ\nZ\n\u1e03 =\nh(da, da) + m\n(\u0227)2 \u2265 0.\nW\n\nW\n\n(9)\n\nW\n\nOn the other hand, taking t = 0 in (4) yields\nZ\nZ\nZ\n\u2217\nb0 =\n\u03c6 b1 =\nb1 ,\nW\n\nW\n\nW\n\nbecause \u03c6 is a diffeomorphism. We can therefore compute\nZ\nZ 1\u0012Z \u0013\nZ\nZ\n\u1e03 =\n\u1e03 dt =\nb1 \u2212\nb0 = 0.\nW \u00d7[0,1]\n\n0\n\nW\n\nW\n\nW\n\nBy (9), \u0227 = 0 and da = 0. As M is connected, a is constant. It follows that f = 0 and\nthus \u03be is Killing.\n\u0003\nWe apply the previous result to compact Vaisman manifolds which, by the structure\ntheorem in [10], are mapping tori with compact, Sasakian fibre. As a direct consequence\nof Remark 2.4(i), Lemma 2.5 and Theorem 3.1 we get:\nTheorem 3.2. Any conformal vector field on a compact Vaisman manifold which is\nneither LCHK nor a diagonal Hopf manifold is Killing and holomorphic.\n\n\f8\n\nANDREI MOROIANU AND LIVIU ORNEA\n\nReferences\n[1] F.
