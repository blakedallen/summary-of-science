The ratio Rjet is studied as a function of the cumulative transverse\nmomentum distribution of the jet. This result can be compared to NLO pQCD calculations and\nthe prediction from LO matrix element + parton shower generators.\n\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nMeasurements of the cross sections of the W and Z bosons in association with hadronic activity are important\ntests of the standard model, particularly perturbative quantum chromodynamics. In addition many searches for\nmodels of physics beyond the Standard Model have significant W +jets or Z+jets backgrounds, adding to the\nimportance of understanding these processes. Individual measurements of W or Z cross sections in association\nwith jets are limited by systematics that are shared between the two measurements, such as the luminosity and\nthe jet energy scale. In contrast, in measurements of the ratio between W and Z cross sections, many of these\nuncertainties cancel due to the similar nature of W and Z production. For this reason the W/Z cross section\nratio can be the basis for a program of high precision measurements.\nThis study reports on a measurement of the ratio of production cross sections of the W and Z bosons with\nexactly one associated jet with pT > 30 GeV as a function of jet transverse momentum threshold. This binning\nimplies that each bin contains all events with a jet above the threshold. The data for this analysis consists of\nthe entire 2010 ATLAS dataset, operating at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). This corresponds to 33 pb\u22121\nof integrated luminosity, taken at a center of mass energy of 7 TeV. A paper on this measurement has been\nproduced by the ATLAS collaboration [1].\nThe ratio is measured in a fiducial measurement volume of the detector where the leptons and jets are\nmeasured with good resolution, in order to avoid theoretical uncertainties associated with modeling particles\noutside of the detector volume. The fiducial region is defined by the following kinematic ranges of the lepton(s)\njet\n`, neutrino \u03bd, and jet: p`T > 20 GeV, p\u03bdT > 25 GeV, pjet\nT > 30 GeV, |\u03b7 | < 2.8. The electrons and muons\nwere restricted to different pseudorapidity ranges, for electrons\nq 1.52 < |\u03b7| < 2.47 or |\u03b7| < 1.37, while for muons\n|\u03b7| < 2.4. For the W, the transverse mass, defined as mT = 2p`T p\u03bdT (1 \u2212 cos(\u03c6` \u2212 \u03c6\u03bd )) was required to satisfy\nmT > 40 GeV. The dilepton invariant mass of the Z was required to be within the range 71 < m`` < 111 GeV.\nParticle level jets were defined as jets reconstructed in simulated events by applying the anti-kt jet reconstruction algorithm [2] with a radius parameter R = 0.4 to all final state particles with a lifetime longer than\n10 ps (including muons and non-interacting particles). Particle level electrons were definedpby including the\nenergy of all radiated photons within a cone of \u2206R = 0.1 around each electron (with \u2206R = (\u2206\u03b7)2 + (\u2206\u03c6)2 ).\nIn the muon case the \"bare\" final state muon is taken as the particle level muon, with no radiated photons\nincluded.\n\nII.\n\nTHE ATLAS DETECTOR\n\nThe ATLAS detector is described in detail elsewhere [3]. Immediately surrounding the interaction point is\nthe inner detector (ID), providing precision tracking and vertexing capabilities, surrounded by a large solenoidal\nmagnet. Outside of this volume lies the electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters, used for energy measurement\nand electron and photon identification. The outermost portion of the detector is the muon spectrometer (MS),\nbased on three large superconducting toroids and a system of three stations of trigger chambers and precision\ntracking chambers.\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nProceedings of the DPF-2011 Conference, Providence, RI, August 8-13, 2011\nIII.\n\nSIMULATED EVENT SAMPLES\n\nSimulated event samples were used to correct signal yields for detector effects, for some of the background\nestimates, and for comparison of the results to theoretical expectations. Samples of W \u2192 `\u03bd + Nparton and\nZ \u2192 `` + Nparton (where ` = e, \u03bc, \u03c4 ) were generated using Alpgen [4]. Background and additional signal\nsamples were generated with Pythia [5] and Powheg [6]. To take into account overlapping pp collisions some\nsamples were generated with multiple non-diffractive scattering events overlapping with the primary collision\nevent. These samples were reweighted such that the distribution of the number of reconstructed primary vertices\nmatched that of the data sample. GEANT4 [7] was used to simulate the detector response for all samples, and\nthese samples were subject to the same reconstruction and analysis chain as the pp collision data.\nPredictions for the W and Z cross sections as a function of jet pT threshold at NLO were obtained using\nMCFM, with corrections to particle level calculated using Pythia, to account for initial and final state radiation,\nhadronization, and underlying event.\nIV.\n\nDATA AND EVENT SELECTION\n\nKinematic requirements for reconstructed muon and electron candidates match those of the fiducial definition:\npT > 25 GeV, |\u03b7| < 2.4. In the electron channel events were triggered based on the presence of an electromagnetic cluster with ET > 15 GeV. Electron candidates were required to satisfy lateral shower containment, shape\nand width criteria, and minimal leakage into the hadronic calorimeter in order to be classified as \"medium\".\nConsistency between track pT and cluster energy as well as tighter hit requirements are additionally required\nto categorize an electron as \"tight\". For the electron channel the pseudorapidity range region 1.37 < |\u03b7| < 1.51\nis rejected due to a gap in the calorimeter coverage.\nIn the muon channel, events were selected by the trigger based on muon spectrometer hits consistent with a\ntrack of 10 or 13 GeV, the tighter requirement applying to later data with higher instantaneous luminosity. Muon\ncandidates were required to have inner detector and muon spectrometer tracks and pass kinematic requirements\nto be classified as \"medium\". To be classified as \"tight,\" consistency is demanded between ID and MS track,\nand requirements on the number of inner detector hits were made. In addition, the impact parameters of the\nmuon are required to be consistent with the\nP interaction point, and the inner detector track is required to be\nisolated from other energetic tracks, with\npT of all tracks within \u2206R < 0.2 less than 1.8 GeV.\nEach event was required to have a reconstructed primary vertex with three or more tracks, and to be within\n150 mm of the center of the detector along the beamline. W candidates were required to have exactly one\nmiss\n\"tight\" lepton with no additional \"medium\" leptons, ET\n> 25 GeV, and MT > 40 GeV. Z candidates are\nrequired to have exactly two leptons of opposite charge, one \"tight\", and one of \"medium\" or higher quality.\nThe invariant mass m`` of the lepton pair is required to be in the range 71 < m`` < 111 GeV.\nReconstructed jets were defined using the anti-kt jet reconstruction algorithm with a radius parameter R = 0.4\nas in the fiducial definition. These jets were required to be within the kinematic range pT > 30 GeV, |\u03b7| < 2.8.\nEvents were rejected if identified as likely to contain a jet from detector noise or a cosmic ray. Events with jets\nwithin a cone of \u2206R < 0.6 from an electron are rejected to avoid distortion of the shower shape from the nearby\nelectromagnetic shower, which could result in reconstruction inefficiency or incorrect energy measurement. Jets\nfrom additional interactions in a bunch crossing were rejected by requiring that 75% of the scalar sum pT of all\ntracks associated with a jet came from tracks originating from the same primary vertex. This approach is termed\nthe jet vertex fraction (JVF) algorithm. Only events containing exactly one jet passing these requirements were\nselected as candidate events.\nUsing these W (Z) selection criteria, 12112 (948) events and 12995 (1376) events were found in the electron\nand muon channels respectively.\nV.\n\nBACKGROUND ESTIMATION\n\nBackgrounds to the measurement are determined independently for each bin of the measurement in jet pT\nthreshold. These backgrounds are categorized as resulting from electroweak or QCD multijet processes, and are\nsubtracted from the total number of events passing selection using the following formula to obtain the signal\nevent yield Nsig :\nNsig = Ntot * (1 \u2212 fmultijet )(1 \u2212 fewk )\n\n(1)\n\n\fProceedings of the DPF-2011 Conference, Providence, RI, August 8-13, 2011\n\n3\n\nThe predicted number of events passing selection cuts is shown for all signal and background processes in\nTable I.\nThe electroweak background fraction fewk is estimated from simulated data as a fraction of the total multijet\nsubtracted event count. This has the advantage of having no dependence on the luminosity, and reduces\ndependence of the background on our measurement volume, as the electroweak processes have similar kinematic\ndistributions.\nThe multijet background processes are estimated using data driven methods that vary based on the channel. In\nmiss\nthe W \u2192 e\u03bd channel, signal and background templates were fit to the control region 15 GeV < ET\n< 55 GeV\nto determine the background fraction. The signal and electroweak background template shapes are taken\nfrom simulation. The multijet event shapes are found from data by selecting \"medium\" electron candidates\nand requiring that 2 of the \"tight\" selection requirements, as well as isolation, are failed, producing what is\nessentially an electron-like multijet sample. The Z \u2192 ee background estimate was performed using a similar\nmethod by fitting templates to the dilepton invariant mass spectrum. Because of smaller background, a looser\nelectron selection and reversal of two of the \"medium\" selection criteria were used in the determination of the\nmultijet template.\nIn the W \u2192 \u03bc\u03bd channel, the multijet background is estimated by measuring the number of events passing\nall selection, and all selection but isolation. The efficiency of this selection is then measured on data control\nsamples in the data. Dimuon events from Z events are used to measure the efficiency for muons from electroweak\nprocesses like the W and Z signal, and dijet events are used to measure the efficiency for muons from the\nmultijet background. Since these two efficiencies are significantly different, the multijet background fraction\ncan be determined. In the Z \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc channel, the multijet background is very small. In this case a scale factor\nis derived by comparing non-isolated dimuon pairs in data and simulation, and used to normalize a simulated\nmultijet sample.\nIn the electron W channel, multijet backgrounds are the dominant background due to the relatively high\nprobability of a jet fragmentation product being reconstructed as an electron. The electron multijet background\nfraction was about 16% for the lowest jet threshold, 30 GeV. Z \u2192 ee, W \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd, and tt\u0304 events are all significant\nsources of electroweak background, which is around 3.4%. The dominant backgrounds in the W \u2192 \u03bc\u03bd channel\nare W \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd decaying to a muon (2%), Z \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc with one muon failing to be reconstructed (3%), and multijet\nevents (3%). In both the electron and muon Z channels, backgrounds were very small, less than 1% for all Z\ncandidates.\nProcess\nW \u2192 e\u03bd\nW \u2192 e\u03bd 9340 \u00b1 40\nZ \u2192 ee\n106 \u00b1 3\nW \u2192 \u03c4\u03bd\n191 \u00b1 6\ntt\u0304\n33 \u00b1 1\nZ \u2192 \u03c4\u03c4\n19 \u00b1 1\nMultijet\n1800 \u00b1 60\nOther\n58 \u00b1 2\nTotal\n11550 \u00b1 70\nData Ntot\n12112\n\nZ \u2192 ee\n3\u00b11\n880 \u00b1 10\n0.2 \u00b1 0.2\n1.9 \u00b1 0.2\n0.3 \u00b1 0.1\n2.9 \u00b1 0.6\n1.1 \u00b1 0.1\n880 \u00b1 10\n948\n\nProcess\nW \u2192 \u03bc\u03bd\nW \u2192 \u03bc\u03bd 11860 \u00b1 40\nZ \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc\n360 \u00b1 6\nW \u2192 \u03c4\u03bd\n234 \u00b1 6\ntt\u0304\n35 \u00b1 1\nZ \u2192 \u03c4\u03c4\n22 \u00b1 1\nMultijet\n380 \u00b1 70\nOther\n117 \u00b1 1\nTotal\n13010 \u00b1 80\nData Ntot\n12995\n\nZ \u2192 \u03bc\u03bc\n4\u00b12\n1370 \u00b1 40\n0.3 \u00b1 0.6\n3\u00b12\n0.3 \u00b1 0.6\n4\u00b14\n8\u00b13\n1380 \u00b1 40\n1376\n\nTABLE\nI: Predicted and observed events in data in the electron and muon channels for the W and Z selections for\nR\nLdt = 33 pb\u22121 .

Therefore, these efficiencies\nwere binned in lepton pT and \u03b7 for the electron channel, and \u03b7 and \u03c6 for the muon channel, for all jet pT\nthresholds.\nWhen the ratio of cross sections is measured, jet resolution and scale effects almost completely cancel. A\n`\ncorrection Cjet\nwas applied to take into account small differences. This correction is defined as the ratio between\nthe Rjet value as a function of particle level jet pT threshold and the Rjet value as a function of reconstructed\njet pT threshold. This factor is measured in simulation samples and applied as follows:\n\nRjet =\n\n`,W\nNpart\n`,Z\nNpart\n\n`\n\u00d7 Cjet\n.\n\n(3)\n\nThis correction is shown for the muon channel in Figure 1. Differences from unity correspond to an offset in\nthe amount of migration between jet pT bins between W+jet and Z+jet events. This is mostly due to selection\ndifferences in the two channels before the jet selection, such as the requirement that the decay products be\nlocated in the detector volume. Note that binning in terms of jet pT threshold eliminates migration across the\nupper bin edges.\n\nVII.\n\nSYSTEMATIC UNCERTAINTIES\n\nIn order to properly take into account correlations between the W and Z measurements, and to maximize\ncancellation of systematic uncertainties, all such uncertainties were measured as a relative change in Rjet .\nThe total systematic uncertainty varies from 4% to 15%, generally increasing with increased jet pT threshold.\nSystematic uncertainties on the measured ratio were divided into five broad groups: multijet background,\n`\n`\nelectoweak background, boson reconstruction (combining \u000f`trig \u00d7 \u000f` \u00d7 CV\n), the jet spectrum correction Cjet\n, and\nuncertainties related to generator differences, as shown in Figure 2.\nSystematics on the multijet background were estimated by varying the parmeters of each method, such as the\nselection of control samples used to derive the background fractions. Systematics on the electoweak background\nare estimated by varying the lepton identification criteria, by varying momentum scale and resolution, and by\ncomparing samples generated with and without additional overlapping pp interactions.\n\n\f0.5\n\nUncertainties\n\nUncertainties\n\nProceedings of the DPF-2011 Conference, Providence, RI, August 8-13, 2011\n\nElectron Channel Uncertainties\n\n0.4\n\nStatistics\n\n0.3\n\nTotal Systematics\n\n0.2\n\nMuon Channel Uncertainties\n0.4\n\nStatistics\n\n0.3\n\nTotal Systematics\n\n0.1\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\n160\n\n180\n\n200\n\nJet p Threshold [GeV]\nT\n\nElectron Channel Systematics\n\nATLAS\n\nMultijet\nElectroweak\n\n0.1\n\nBoson Reconstruction\nJets\nGenerator (Syst. \u2295 Stat.)\n\n0.05\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\n160\n\n180\n\n200\n\nJet p Threshold [GeV]\nT\n\nSystematic Uncertainties\n\nSystematic Uncertainties\n\n0.5\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n0\n\n5\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\n160\n\n180\n\n200\n\nJet p Threshold [GeV]\nT\n\nMuon Channel Systematics\n\nATLAS\n\nMultijet\nElectroweak\n\n0.1\n\nBoson Reconstruction\nJets\nGenerator (Syst. \u2295 Stat.)\n\n0.05\n\n0\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\n140\n\n160\n\n180\n\n200\n\nJet p Threshold [GeV]\nT\n\nFIG. 2: Relative systematic uncertainties on Rjet in the electron channel (left) and in the muon channel (right). The\ntop plot displays the total systematic and statistical uncertainty (shown as red dashed line) versus jet pT threshold.\nThe lower plot shows the breakdown of the systematic uncertainties. The \"boson reconstruction\" entry contains the\nmiss\n(including trigger and lepton identification). The \"jet\" entry contains\nuncertainties related to the leptons and ET\nsystematics of the jet correction as well as the jet energy scale and resolution. Uncertainties from each group were added\nin quadrature.\n\nBoson reconstruction systematic uncertainties included those associated with identification and trigger efficiency, as well as scale and resolution effects. The single lepton trigger and identification efficiency uncertainties\nwere derived using the methods documented in Ref. [8], and then propagated to uncertainties on Rjet . This\nleads to a total identification efficiency uncertainty of 1.1%(1.7%) for electrons (muons) independent of jet pT .\nTrigger efficiency uncertainties were very small in both channels.\nmiss\nUncertainties involving the scale of lepton momenta and ET\nwere evaluated by directly scaling up and down\nthe quantity in question by the measured scale uncertainty. In each case the deviation of Rjet was applied as\na systematic uncertainty. Similarly, resolution effects were evaluated by smearing the quantities by a gaussian\nwith the width of the measured resolution, repeating this process and taking the root mean squared deviation\nas the systematic uncertainty. Lepton momentum scale and resolution measurements and their uncertainties\nare determined by comparing the width and position of the invariant mass spectrum of Z candidates in data to\nthat in a simulated sample.\nJet related systematics included those involved with jet energy scale (JES), jet energy resolution (JER) and\ntheir associated uncertainties. These quantities were determined from data and simulation comparisons [9].\nThe JES uncertainty includes components from calibration and jet sample composition differences. The JES\ncalibration uncertainty varies with |\u03b7| and pT , and ranges from 4% to 8%. The JES and JER were measured\nwith di-jet events, which have different proportions of quark and gluon initiated jets than events containing\nvector bosons. Therefore, an uncertainty was assigned to account for the difference in calorimeter response\nbetween jets in V + jet events and the di-jet events used for calibration, ranging from 2 to 5%, and was added\nin quadrature to the JES calibration uncertainty. The total JES uncertainty ranges from approximately 10% at\n20 GeVto 5% at 100 GeV. The JER is measured to vary from 2% at 20 GeVto 1% at 100 GeV. The uncertainties\non Rjet due to JER and JES were evaluated using the same approach as for the lepton scale and resolution\nuncertainties. The uncertainties on Rjet due to the JER and JES were found to be approximately 0.5% and 2%\nrespective. This uncertainty includes a very small term to to take into account the uncertainty on JER itself.\nJet related systematics also included the dominant uncertainty related to multiple pp collisions, the uncertainty of the efficiency of the JVF algorithm. Applying this algorithm to simulation with multiple interactions\nwas found to produce consistent results with simulation not including additional interactions. The residual\n`\ndifference on Rjet between these cases was used as a systematic uncertainty on Cjet\n.\nTo account for systematics associated with generator modeling, correction factors were computed with samples\ngenerated with Pythia instead of Alpgen, and the observed difference was applied as a systematic uncertainty.\n`\nSystematic uncertainties were assigned from this variation to the following corrections: (Cjet\n), the boson re`\nconstruction correction CV\n, and the electroweak background estimation fewk . At large jet pT threshold, where\nthe statistical uncertainty on the measurement dominates the total uncertainty, this systematic uncertainty is\nlimited in statistical precision due to the size of the samples used, and is the dominant systematic uncertainty.\n\n\f6\n\nProceedings of the DPF-2011 Conference, Providence, RI, August 8-13, 2011\nSystematic uncertainties were also estimated on the theoretical prediction. As our NLO parton-level calculation does not include the effects of hadronisation and underlying event, a correction was computed using\nPythia as a function of jet pT threshold. The uncertainty on this correction was evaluated by observing the\neffect of various generator tunes on the final Rjet result. These tunes increased or decreased the amount of\nunderlying event, or varied the parameters controlling initial and final state radiation. Renormalization and\nfactorization scale uncertainties were also included in our systematic uncertainties, as were PDF uncertainties.\n\nVIII.\n\nRESULTS\n\nThe ratio Rjet was measured in the fiducial region of the ATLAS detector as a function of jet pT threshold,\nand corrected for detector effects. The electron and muon measurements were performed in slightly different\nphase space, due to the different \u03b7 range and electron-jet isolation requirements, as well as for the different\nQED treatment between electron and muon definitions. The observed signal yields were corrected to recover\nthe yield at particle level as described in Section VI.\nThe corrected ratio Rjet of the production cross sections in the leptonic (electron or muon) decays of the\ngauge bosons W and Z in association with exactly one jet is shown in Figure 3 as a function of the jet pT\nthreshold for the electron (left) and muon (right) channels. As the jet pT threshold increases, the ratio Rjet is\nexpected to decrease as the effective scale of the interaction becomes large compared to the difference in boson\nmasses. This dependence is observed in the data.

Each channel was extrapolated to a common phase\nspace, defined as |\u03b7` | < 2.5 before any QED radiation (Born level) with Pythia. The electron channel was\nfurther corrected for the effect of the electron-jet isolation requirements on the acceptance. This extrapolation\nto a common fiducial region decreases the value of the ratio for both channels primarily due to the more central\ndistribution of leptons from the Z.

This ratio was measured in fiducial phase\nspace of the detector separately for muons and electrons. These results were also extrapolated to a common\nphase space and combined, as well as extrapolated to be the full phase space of the boson decay products. These\nresults were provided as a function of jet pT threshold from 30 to 200 GeV, exploring the transition region of\nelectroweak scale breaking in perturbative jet production. The accepted theoretical model was found to be\nconsistent with all results. This measurement has the advantage of having reduced theoretical and experimental\nsystematic uncertainties due to correlations between the W and Z processes. This measurement builds the\nfoundations of a high precision test of the Standard Model, and provides model-independent sensitivity to new\nphysics coupling to leptons and jets. Comparisons with LO and NLO perturbative QCD predictions were made\nand found to be in agreement with data over the jet pT threshold range covered by this measurement.\n\n\f8\n\nProceedings of the DPF-2011 Conference, Providence, RI, August 8-13, 2011\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n\nATLAS Collaboration, arXiv:1108.4908[hep-ex] (2011).\nM.
