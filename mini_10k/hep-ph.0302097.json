INTRODUCTION\n\nThe masses and flavor mixing angles of six quarks are free parameters in the standard\nelectroweak model, but their values can directly or indirectly be determined from a number\nof experiments [1]. The fact that three quark masses in each (up or down) sector perform a\nstrong hierarchy is a big puzzle to particle physicists, so is the hierarchy of three quark mixing\nangles. Theoretical attempts to solve the puzzle, e.g., those starting from supersymmetric\ngrand unification theories or from superstring theories [2], are encouraging but have not\nproved to be very successful. Phenomenologically, the common approach is to find out simple\ntextures of quark mass matrices, from which a bridge between the hierarchy of quark mixing\nangles and that of quark masses can naturally be established [3]. The flavor symmetries\nhidden in such textures might finally provide us with useful hints towards the underlying\ndynamics responsible for the generation of quark masses and the origin of CP violation.\nThe Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) quark mixing matrix V arises from the mismatch between the diagonalization of the up-type quark mass matrix MU and that of the\ndown-type quark mass matrix MD [4]. Without loss of generality, one may arrange MU and\nMD to be Hermitian in the framework of the standard model or its extensions which have\nno flavor-changing right-handed currents [5]. There exist two reciprocal ways to explore\npossible relations between the hierarchy of V and that of MU and MD :\n(a) Taking account of a specific texture of the Hermitian quark mass matrix MU or MD ,\nwhich might result from a new flavor symmetry and its explicit breaking or rely on some\nplausible theoretical arguments, one may do the unitary transformation\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\u03b4u 0 0\n\uf8ec\n\u2020\nOU MU OU = \uf8ed 0 \u03b4c 0 \uf8f7\n\uf8f8 ,\n0 0 \u03b4t\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\u03b4d 0 0\n\uf8f7\n\u2020\nOD\nMD OD = \uf8ec\n\uf8ed 0 \u03b4s 0 \uf8f8 ,\n0 0 \u03b4b\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b4i stands for the mass eigenvalue of the i-quark. Then the CKM matrix V is given\nas V = OU\u2020 OD , from which the quark mixing angles can be expressed in terms of the ratios\nof quark masses (and other unfixed parameters of MU and MD ). This normal approach has\nextensively been discussed in the literature [3].\n(b) Taking account of the experimentally-allowed pattern of V and making some proper\nassumptions to decompose V into V = OU\u2020 OD (e.g., the principle of \"naturalness\" disfavors\nany severe fine-tuning of or delicate cancellations between relevant parameters in the unitary\ntransformation matrices OU and OD ), one may construct the Hermitian quark mass matrices\nMU and MD through\n\uf8eb\n\n\u03b4u 0\n\uf8ec\nMU = OU \uf8ed 0 \u03b4c\n0 0\n\uf8eb\n\u03b4d 0\n\uf8ec\nMD = OD \uf8ed 0 \u03b4s\n0 0\n2\n\n\uf8f6\n\n0\n\uf8f7\n0 \uf8f8 OU\u2020 ,\n\u03b4t\n\uf8f6\n0\n\uf8f7 \u2020\n.\n0 \uf8f8 OD\n\u03b4b\n\n(2)\n\n\fThis reverse approach has also attracted some attention in the literature [6].\nIn this Brief Report, we present a further study of the relationship between the CKM\nmatrix and the quark mass matrices by following approach (b). Our main goal is to derive\nthe phenomenologically-favored textures of Hermitian quark mass matrices from the CKM\nmatrix. We are guided by the hierarchy of quark masses, the hierarchy of the CKM matrix\nelements and the afore-mentioned principle of naturalness. The only assumption that we\nneed to make is the structural parallelism between up- and down-quark mass matrices. Such\nan empirical assumption should essentially be true, if two quark sectors are governed by the\nsame dynamics. We arrive at two explicit textures of quark mass matrices, which were\nnot obtained in Ref. [6]. One of them is particularly interesting, as its form is somehow\nsimilar to the Ans\u00e4tze proposed by Rosner and Worah [7] and by Roberts et al [8]. A\ncareful comparison shows that our pattern of quark mass matrices is compatible with the\nansatz advocated in Ref. [8], while the Rosner-Worah pattern is not favored by the present\nexperimental data.\nII. HIERARCHY AND UP-DOWN PARALLELISM\n\nThe hierarchy of quark flavor mixing can clearly be seen from the Wolfenstein\nparametrization of the CKM matrix V [9]:\n1 \u2212 21 \u03bb2 \u2212 18 \u03bb4\n\uf8ec\nV \u2248 \uf8ed\n\u2212\u03bb\nq\u03bb3\n\uf8eb\n\n\u03bb\n1 2\n1\n1 \u2212 2 \u03bb \u2212 8 (1 + 4A2 ) \u03bb4\n\u2212A\u03bb2 + 12 (2q \u2212 A) \u03bb4\n\np\u03bb3\n\uf8f7\nA\u03bb2\n\uf8f8 ,\n1 \u2212 21 A2 \u03bb4\n\uf8f6\n\n(3)\n\nwhere p \u2261 A(\u03c1\u2212i\u03b7), q \u2261 A(1\u2212\u03c1\u2212i\u03b7), and the terms of or below O(\u03bb5 ) have been neglected.\nCurrent experimental data yield \u03bb \u2248 0.22, A \u2248 0.83, \u03c1 \u2248 0.17 and \u03b7 \u2248 0.36 [10]. Thus we\nhave\nq\n\n|p| = A \u03c12 + \u03b7 2 \u2248 0.33 ,\nq\n\n|q| = A (1 \u2212 \u03c1)2 + \u03b7 2 \u2248 0.75 .\n\n(4)\n\nWe find that |p|/|q| \u2248 2\u03bb holds and |Vub| = |p|\u03bb3 is actually of O(\u03bb4 ).\nTo construct the Hermitian quark mass matrices MU and MD from V through Eq. (2),\nthe key point is to determine the unitary transformation matrices OU and OD . As the\nphysical quark masses (mu , mc , mt ) or (md , ms , mb ) approximately perform a geometrical\nhierarchy at a common energy scale (e.g., the electroweak scale \u03bc = MZ [3]),\nmc\nmu\n\u223c\n\u223c \u03b62 ,\nmc\nmt\nmd\nms\n\u223c\n\u223c \u03bb2 ,\nms\nmb\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u03b6 is of O(\u03bb2 ) and can be defined as \u03b6 \u2261 \u03ba\u03bb2 with \u03ba \u223c O(1), we are allowed to\nexpand the matrix elements of MU or MD in powers of \u03b6 or \u03bb. Provided two quark sectors\nare governed by the same dynamics, MU and MD are then expected to have approximately\nparallel structures characterized respectively by the perturbative parameters \u03b6 and \u03bb. This\n3\n\n\fup-down parallelism would be exact, if the geometrical relations in Eq. (5) held exactly\n(i.e., mu /mc = mc /mt = \u03b6 2 and md /ms = ms /mb = \u03bb2 ). Note that the parallelism between\nMU and MD implies the parallelism between OU and OD , whose textures can respectively be\nexpanded in terms of \u03b6 and \u03bb. Since the CKM matrix V = OU\u2020 OD deviates from the unity\nmatrix only at the O(\u03bb) level, both OU and OD must be close to the unity matrix in the\nspirit of naturalness. It is therefore instructive to expand OU and OD as follows:\nOU = I +\nOD = I +\n\n\u221e \u0010\nX\n\n\u0011\n\nZnU \u03b6 n ,\n\nn=1\n\u221e \u0010\nX\n\n\u0011\n\nZnD \u03bbn ,\n\n(6)\n\nn=1\n\nwhere I stands for the unity matrix, and ZnU or ZnD (for n = 1, 2, 3, ***) denotes the coefficient\nmatrix of \u03b6 n or \u03bbn . While ZnU \u223c ZnD should in general hold, the simplest possibility is\nZnU = ZnD (\u2261 Zn ), equivalent to the exact parallelism between OU and OD . In this especially\ninteresting case, the expressions of Z1 , Z2 , Z3 and Z4 can concretely be determined from\nEqs. (3) and (6):\nZ1\n\nZ2\n\nZ3\n\nZ4\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n0\n1\n0\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n0\n0\uf8f8 ,\n= \uf8ed \u22121\n0\n0\n0\n\uf8eb 1\n\uf8f6\n\u22122\n\u03ba\n0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n= \uf8ed \u2212\u03ba \u2212 21 A \uf8f8 ,\n0 \u2212A 0\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\u2212\u03ba 0\np\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n= \uf8ed 0 \u2212\u03ba 0 \uf8f8 ,\nq\n0\n0\n\uf8eb 1\n\uf8f6\n2\n\u2212 8 (1 + 4\u03ba )\n\u2212 12 \u03ba (1 + 2\u03ba2 )\nA\u03ba\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n= \uf8ed 21 \u03ba (1 \u2212 2\u03ba2 ) \u2212 18 (1 + 4\u03ba2 + 4A2 ) A\u03ba2 \uf8f8 .\n0\n\u2212A\u03ba2 + 21 (A \u2212 2p\u2217 ) \u2212 12 A2\n\n(7)\n\nWe see that the complex CP -violating phase enters OU or OD at the level of O(\u03b6 3 ) or O(\u03bb3 ).\nAs a straightfoward consequence of \u03b6 \u223c O(\u03bb2 ), the contribution of OD to V is dominant\nover that of OU to V .\nWith the help of Eqs. (6) and (7), we are now able to derive the hierarchical textures of\nMU and MD from Eq. (2). Note that the quark mass eigenvalues (\u03b4u , \u03b4c , \u03b4t ) and (\u03b4d , \u03b4s , \u03b4b ) in\nEq. (2) may be either positive or negative. Without loss of generality, we take \u03b4t = mt and\n\u03b4b = mb . The other four mass eigenvalues can be expressed, in view of Eq. (5), as follows:\n\u03b4u = ru \u03b6 4 mt ,\n\u03b4c = rc \u03b6 2mt ;\n\n(8)\n\n\u03b4d = rd \u03bb4 mb ,\n\u03b4s = rs \u03bb2 mb ,\n\n(9)\n\nand\n\n4\n\n\fwhere |ru | \u223c |rc | \u223c |rd | \u223c |rs | \u223c O(1) holds. Then we arrive at the results of MU and MD :\n(ru + rc )\u03b6 4\n\uf8ec\nr\u0303c \u03b6 3\nMU \u2248 mt \uf8ed\np\u2217\u03b6 \u03b6 3\n\uf8eb\n(rd + rs )\u03bb4\n\uf8ec\nr\u0303s \u03bb3\nMD \u2248 mb \uf8ed\np\u2217\u03bb \u03bb3\n\uf8eb\n\nr\u0303c \u03b6 3 p\u03b6 \u03b6 3\n\uf8f7\nrc \u03b6 2 A\u03b6 2 \uf8f8 ,\nA\u03b6 2\n1\n\uf8f6\n3\nr\u0303s \u03bb p\u03bb \u03bb3\n\uf8f7\nrs \u03bb2 A\u03bb2 \uf8f8 ,\nA\u03bb2\n1\n\uf8f6\n\n(10)\n\nwhere\nr\u0303c \u2261 rc (1 + \u03ba\u03b6) ,\nr\u0303s \u2261 rs (1 + \u03ba\u03bb) ,\n\n(11)\n\np\u03b6 \u2261 p + \u03baA\u03b6 ,\np\u03bb \u2261 p + \u03baA\u03bb .\n\n(12)\n\nand\n\nWe see that the parallelism between MU and MD in Eq. (10) is not exact (e.g., p\u03b6 \u2248 p 6= p\u03bb ),\neven though the exact parallelism between OU and OD has been assumed in our calculations.\nNote that the sign uncertainties of quark mass eigenvalues may lead to two distinct\ntextures of MU and MD . If ru (or rd ) and rc (or rs ) have the same sign, the (1,1) element of\nMU (or MD ) amounts approximately to 2rc \u03b6 4 (or 2rs \u03bb4 ). In this case, we obtain\n2rc \u03b6 4\nMU \u2248 mt \uf8ec\n\uf8ed r\u0303c \u03b6 3\np\u2217 \u03b6 3\n\uf8eb \u03b6 4\n2rs \u03bb\n\uf8ec\nMD \u2248 mb \uf8ed r\u0303s \u03bb3\np\u2217\u03bb \u03bb3\n\uf8eb\n\nr\u0303c \u03b6 3 p\u03b6 \u03b6 3\nrc \u03b6 2 A\u03b6 2 \uf8f7\n\uf8f8 ,\n2\nA\u03b6\n1\n\uf8f6\n3\nr\u0303s \u03bb p\u03bb \u03bb3\n\uf8f7\nrs \u03bb2 A\u03bb2 \uf8f8 .\nA\u03bb2\n1\n\uf8f6\n\n(13)\n\nIf the signs of ru (or rd ) and rc (or rs ) are opposite to each other, however, a very significant\ncancellation must appear between them 1 . In this case, the (1,1) elements of MU and MD\nare expected to be of or below O(\u03b6 5 ) and O(\u03bb5 ), respectively. Then we are led to a somehow\nsimpler texture of quark mass matrices:\n\uf8eb\n\n0\n\uf8ec\nMU \u2248 mt \uf8ed r\u0303c \u03b6 3\np\u2217 \u03b6 3\n\uf8eb \u03b6\n0\n\uf8ec\nMD \u2248 mb \uf8ed r\u0303s \u03bb3\np\u2217\u03bb \u03bb3\n\nr\u0303c \u03b6 3 p\u03b6 \u03b6 3\n\uf8f7\nrc \u03b6 2 A\u03b6 2 \uf8f8 ,\nA\u03b6 2\n1\n\uf8f6\n3\nr\u0303s \u03bb p\u03bb \u03bb3\n\uf8f7\nrs \u03bb2 A\u03bb2 \uf8f8 .\nA\u03bb2\n1\n\uf8f6\n\n1 This\n\n(14)\n\ncancellation does not involve two different quark sectors, thus it has no conflict with the\nprinciple of naturalness mentioned before.\n\n5\n\n\fThe textures of Hermitian quark mass matrices in Eqs. (13) and (14) result naturally from\nthe quark mass hierarchy and the up-down parallelism. Therefore they can be regarded\nas two promising candidates for the \"true\" quark mass matrices in an underlying effective\ntheory of quark mass generation at low energies.\nIII. COMPARISON WITH TWO EXISTING ANS\u00c4TZE\n\nNow let us compare the texture of quark mass matrices obtained in Eq. (14) with two\nexisting Ans\u00e4tze proposed by Rosner and Worah (RW) in Ref. [7] and by Roberts, Romanino,\nRoss and Velasco-Sevilla (RRRV) in Ref. [8]. Note that quark mass matrices of both RW\nand RRRV forms are symmetric instead of Hermitian. Their consequences on quark flavor\nmixing and CP violation are essentially unchanged, however, if the Hermiticity is imposed\non them [8]. For this reason, we consider the Hermitian versions of the RW and RRRV\nAns\u00e4tze and compare them with Eq. (14).\nThe RW ansatz of quark mass matrices is based on a composite model of spin-1/2\nparticles [7] and its Hermitian form can be written as\n\u221a\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n0\n2\u03b1U \u221a\u03b1U\n\u221a\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\u2217\nMU = \uf8ed 2\u03b1U\n2\u03b2U \uf8f8 ,\n\u03b2U\n\u221a\n\u2217\n2\u03b2\n\u03b3U\n\u03b1U\n\u221a U\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n0\n2\u03b1\n\u03b1\nD\nD\n\u221a\n\uf8ec\u221a \u2217\n\uf8f7\nMD = \uf8ed 2\u03b1D\n\u03b2\n2\u03b2D \uf8f8 ,\n(15)\nD\n\u221a\n\u2217\n2\u03b2D\n\u03b1D\n\u03b3D\nwhere \u03b1U and \u03b1D are complex parameters so as to accommodate the observed effects of\nCP violation in the quark sector [1]. Comparing between Eqs. (14) and (15), we find that\nthe latter could basically be reproduced from the former, if the following conditions were\nsatisfied:\n\u221a\n|r\u0303c |\nA\n\u2248\n\u2248 2,\n|p\u03b6 |\n|rc |\n\u221a\nA\n|r\u0303s |\n\u2248\n\u2248 2.\n|p\u03bb |\n|rs |\n\n(16)\n\nIn view of Eqs. (8) and (9) as well as Eqs. (11) and (12), we immediately realize that the\nrelations in Eq. (16) are impossible to hold. Hence the RW texture is actually incompatible\nwith ours given in Eq. (14). Does this incompatibility imply the disagreement between the\nRW ansatz and current experimental data? We find that the answer is affirmative. Since\nthe (1,2) and (1,3) elements of MU or MD in Eq. (15) are comparable in magnitude, we\nare led to the prediction\n1\n|Vtd | \u2248 |Vub| \u223c \u221a \u03bb3\n2\n\n(17)\n\nin the leading-order approximation. Such a result is obviously inconsistent with the present\nexperimental data, which require |Vub| \u223c O(\u03bb4 ) and |Vub /Vtd | \u2248 |p|/|q| \u2248 2\u03bb. Thus the\n6\n\n\fRW texture of quark mass matrices, no matter whether it is Hermitian or symmetric, is no\nlonger favored in phenomenology.\nThe Hermitian RRRV ansatz of quark mass matrices [8] takes the form 2\n0\nbU \u01eb3U cU \u01eb4U\n\uf8ec \u2217 3\n\u01eb2U\naU \u01eb2U \uf8f7\nMU = mt \uf8ed bU \u01ebU\n\uf8f8 ,\nc\u2217U \u01eb4U a\u2217U \u01eb2U\n1\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n0\nbD \u01eb3D cD \u01eb4D\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\u01eb2D\naD \u01eb2D \uf8f8 ,\nMD = mb \uf8ed b\u2217D \u01eb3D\nc\u2217D \u01eb4D a\u2217D \u01eb2D\n1\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8eb\n\nq\n\n(18)\n\nq\n\nwhere \u01ebU \u2248 mc /mt and \u01ebD \u2248 ms /mb stand respectively for the expansion parameters of\nup- and down-quark sectors, and the remaining parameters (aU , bU , cU ) and (aD , bD , cD ) are\nall of O(1) in magnitude. From Eqs. (8) and (9), we obtain the relation between \u01ebU (or \u01ebD )\nand \u03b6 (or \u03bb) as follows:\nq\n\n\u01ebU \u2248 \u03b6 |rc | ,\nq\n\n\u01ebD \u2248 \u03bb |rs | .\n\n(19)\n\nIn addition, we find\n|aU | \u2248\n\nA\n,\n|rc |\n1 + \u03ba\u03b6\n\n,\n|bU | \u2248 q\n|rc |\n|cU | \u2248\n\n|p\u03b6 |\n;\n\u03b6|rc |2\n\n|aD | \u2248\n\nA\n,\n|rs |\n1 + \u03ba\u03bb\n\n(20)\n\nand\n\n,\n|bD | \u2248 q\n|rs |\n|cD | \u2248\n\n|p\u03bb |\n.\n\u03bb|rs |2\n\n(21)\n\nIt is obvious that the moduli of (aU , bU , cU ) and (aD , bD , cD ) are all of O(1), consistent with\nthe assumption made in Ref. [8] 3 . Hence the RRRV ansatz is compatible with our texture of\n\n2 This\n\ntexture is indeed similar to the one discussed by Branco et al in Ref. [11].\n\n3 Note\n\nthat |cU | \u223c \u03bb/\u03b6 \u223c 1/\u03bb may be around 4.5, but it has little impact on the global fit of the\nRRRV ansatz to current experimental data [8].\n\n7\n\n\fquark mass matrices given in Eq. (14) and favored by current experimental data on quark\nflavor mixing.\nIt is worth remarking that a simplification of the RRRV ansatz to the following four-zero\ntexture\n0\nbU \u01eb3U\n0\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec \u2217 3\n\u01eb2U\naU \u01eb2U \uf8f8 ,\nMU = mt \uf8ed bU \u01ebU\n0\na\u2217U \u01eb2U\n1\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n3\n0\nbD \u01ebD\n0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\u01eb2D\naD \u01eb2D \uf8f8\nMD = mb \uf8ed b\u2217D \u01eb3D\n0\na\u2217D \u01eb2D\n1\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8eb\n\n(22)\n\nq\n\nwould give rise to the prediction |Vub |/|Vcb| \u2248 mu /mc \u2264 0.06 [12] for reasonable values of\nmu and mc [13], which is difficult to agree with the present experimental result |Vub/Vcb |ex \u2248\n0.09 [1]. Such a discrepancy implies that the interesting four-zero pattern of quark mass\nmatrices in Eq. (22) might no longer be favored 4 .\nComparing Eq. (18) with Eqs. (15) and (22), we see that the (1,3) elements of MU and\nMD should be neither larger than or comparable with their neighboring (1,2) elements nor\nvanishing or negligibly small. This observation is particularly true for MD , which contributes\ndominantly to the CKM matrix V .\nIV. SUMMARY\n\nWe have derived two phenomenologically-favored textures of Hermitian quark mass matrices from the CKM matrix. Our starting points of view include the hierarchy of quark\nmasses, the hierarchy of the CKM matrix elements and the principle of naturalness. The\nmain assumption that we have made is the structural parallelism between up- and downquark mass matrices, which is expected to be true if two quark sectors are governed by the\nsame dynamics.\nWe have compared one of the obtained textures with two existing Ans\u00e4tze of quark\nmass matrices, proposed by Rosner and Worah and by Roberts et al. It turns out that the\nRosner-Worah ansatz is no more favored in phenomenology, while the ansatz of Roberts et\nal is in good agreement with current experimental data.\nWe hope that our results for the structures of quark mass matrices may serve as useful\nguides to model building, from which some deeper understanding of quark masses, flavor\nmixing and CP violation can finally be achieved.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThis work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China.\n\n4 Note,\n\nhowever, that the general four-zero texture of Hermitian quark mass matrices can still be\nin good agreement with current experimental data.
