I have been studying quasicrystals for over 15 years\nand investigating nanomechanical systems for just about a decade, and although one always\nfinds connections between different scientific fields, I had never expected such an invitation.\nNevertheless, the organizers insisted and explained that they wanted to learn about the\npossibility of exploiting nontrivial symmetries-perhaps imitating what viruses do-and in\ngeneral, learn the lesson of a scientific community that was forced by nature to keep an open\nmind and \"think outside of the box\".\nThis chapter is motivated by my presentation on quasicrystals at the NATO ARW on\nnanotechnology in St. Petersburg. I begin in Sec. 2 by describing the discovery of quasicrystals and the scientific revolution that followed. I argue that now that the surprise has long\nsubsided, and we are well aware of the possibility for having long-range order without periodicity, we are equipped with much knowledge that can be adopted in other fields-possibly\nnanotechnology. Particularly relevant are efforts to fabricate artificial functional micro- or\nnanostructures, as well as efforts to control the self-assembly of nanostructures. I give an\nelementary introduction to quasicrystals in Sec. 3. I then continue in Sec. 4 with an overview\non the use of quasicrystalline structures in artificial metamaterials for photonic applications,\nand proceed in Sec. 5 to give a description of our current studies of the self-assembly of\n1\n\n\fNanotechnology and Quasicrystals\n\nRon Lifshitz\n\nsoft matter, namely micelle-forming dendrimers and polymeric stars, into quasicrystals. I\nmake an interlude in Sec. 6 to an even softer system-parametrically-excited surface waves\nin fluids-that spontaneously forms quasicrystalline patterns. I finish in Sec. 8 by mentioning some dynamical properties of quasicrystals that might be more easily investigated in\nsoft-matter quasicrystals than in solid-state quasicrystals, introducing yet another physical\nsystem, that of optically-induced nonlinear photonic quasicrystals, which we have been using\nto study quasicrystals.\n\n2\n\nThe discovery of quasicrystals as a modern-day\nscientific revolution\n\nFor almost two millennia crystallography was predominantly concerned with the external\nmorphology of crystals. Crystallographers studied the naturally-occurring facets of crystals,\nwhich always intersect at precise and characteristic angles. It was only in the 17th century\nthat modern crystallography was born, thanks to the brilliant idea-attributed to such great\nscientists as Kepler and Hooke-that crystal shapes were the result of internal order of\n\"atomic\" units. In his study of tilings of the plane by polygons, Kepler [1] was quick to\nrealize that very few regular polygons-namely the triangle, the square, and the hexagon-\ncan tile the plane without introducing overlaps or leaving holes. Yet, this observation did\nnot deter him from constructing a well-ordered tiling of the plane, consisting of pentagons\nand decagons that requires some of the decagons to overlap, and leaves holes in the form of\n5-fold stars-a tiling that was to be rediscovered by Penrose more than 350 years later [2, 3].\nWithout realizing it, Kepler had discovered some of the basic properties of aperiodic order,\ncommenting in his own words that \"The structure is very elaborate and intricate.\"\nUnfortunately, by the end of the 18th century, when Ha\u00fcy began formulating the mathematical theory of crystallography [4], Kepler's insightful drawings of aperiodic tilings with\ndecagonal symmetry were long forgotten. Consequently, mathematical crystallography was\nfounded upon the premise that the internal order of crystals was necessarily achieved through\na periodic filling of space. Thus, crystallography treated order and periodicity synonymously,\nusing either property interchangeably to define the notion of a crystal. The periodic nature\nof crystals was \"confirmed\" with the discovery of x-ray crystallography and numerous other\nexperimental techniques throughout the 20th century. As they are more \"elaborate and intricate\" and less commonly found in Nature, aperiodic crystals were completely overlooked.\nPeriodicity became the underlying paradigm, not only for crystallography itself, but also\nfor other disciplines such as materials science, solid state chemistry, and condensed matter\nphysics, whose most basic experimental and theoretical tools rely on its existence.\nThis historical oversight was corrected with Shechtman's discovery of quasicrystals in\n1982-a discovery that sparked a bona fide Kuhnian scientific revolution [5], as described\nby Cahn [6], one of the co-authors of the announcement of the discovery, which appeared\nonly two years later in 1984 [7]. In the famous Hargittai interviews [8] with all the scientists\n2\n\n\fNanotechnology and Quasicrystals\n\nRon Lifshitz\n\ninvolved in the initial study of quasicrystals, Mackay is quoted as saying that\n\"It's a discovery of a material which breaks the laws that were artificially constructed. They were not laws of nature; they were laws of the human classificatory\nsystem.\"\nNature had found a way of achieving order without periodicity, and Shechtman was the\nfirst to pay attention to it, and not to dismiss it as an experimental artifact, as many must\nhave done before him. He confronted a skeptical scientific community that was unwilling to\nrelinquish its most basic paradigm that order stems from periodicity. His biggest challenger\nwas Pauling, one of the greatest chemists of the 20th century and a leading crystallographer\nof that time. In a remarkable article, suggesting an alternative description of Shechtman's\nicosahedral quasicrystal as multiple twinning of periodic cubic crystals-a description that\nnot much later was shown to be incorrect [9]-Pauling [10] concluded by saying that\n\"Crystallographers can now cease to worry that the validity of one of the accepted\nbases of their science has been questioned\".\nToday, thousands of diffraction diagrams later, compounded by high-quality experimental\ndata-such as images from high-resolution transmission electron microscopes and atomicresolution scanning tunneling microscopes-the existence of order without periodicity has\nbeen unequivocally established. Not only has the periodicity paradigm been questioned,\nas Pauling worried, it has been completely shattered. By 1992, only a decade after the\ndiscovery, the International Union of Crystallography, through its Commission on Aperiodic\nCrystals [11], was ready to publish a provisional definition of the term crystal that abolishes\nperiodicity, and implies that order should be its replacement. The commission was not ready\nto give precise microscopic descriptions of all the ways in which order can be achieved. Clearly,\nperiodicity is one way of achieving order, quasiperiodicity as in the Penrose-Kepler tiling is\nanother, but the committee was uncertain whether there were other ways that were yet to\nbe discovered. The Commission opted to shift the definition from a microscopic description\nof the crystal to a property of the data collected in a diffraction experiment. It decided on a\ntemporary working-definition whereby a crystal is\n\"any solid having an essentially discrete diffraction diagram.\"\nThus, crystals that are periodic are now explicitly called periodic crystals, all others are called\naperiodic crystals.\nThe 1992 definition is consistent with the notion of long-range order-one of the basic\nnotions of condensed-matter physics [12, 13]-dating back to ideas of Landau in which the\nsymmetry-breaking transition from a disordered (high-symmetry) phase to an ordered (lowsymmetry) phase is quantified by the appearance of a non-zero order parameter-in this case,\nthe appearance of Bragg peaks in the Fourier spectrum. Stated in plain words, long-range\norder-or in the context of our current discussion, long-range positional order-is a measure\nof the correlations between the positions of atoms in distant regions of the material.\n3\n\n\fNanotechnology and Quasicrystals\n\nRon Lifshitz\n\nThe 1992 definition was left sufficiently vague so as not to impose unnecessary constraints\non any further study of crystallinity. Indeed, the discovery inspired a renaissance in crystallography, and has made a great impact on mathematics [14], as can be seen by an ever\nincreasing number of books [15\u201318]. Much effort has been invested in studying the characteristics of order, as well as in the development of diffraction theory [19\u201321], once it was\nrealized that periodicity was not a necessary condition for order and for the appearance of\nBragg peaks in a diffraction spectrum. In particular, Baake and several co-workers [22\u201326]\nhave performed a systematic study whose purpose is to characterize which distributions of\nmatter diffract to produce a pure point component in their spectrum, and thus can qualify\nas possessing long-range order. Sufficient progress has already been made, that we are now\nready to complete the paradigm shift and adopt a permanent definition of crystal that is\nfirmly based on the notion of order [27].\nIn October 2007 the quasicrystal community-consisting of mathematicians, physicists,\nchemists, materials scientists, surface scientists, and even photonics engineers-celebrated\nthe 25th anniversary of the discovery in a \"Silver Jubilee\" conference [28]. Today, the science\nof quasicrystals, with its growing number of textbooks [15\u201318, 29\u201333], is a mature science.\nOld paradigms have been carefully transformed into new ones [34]; definitions have been\nchanged [35]; space-group theory has been generalized to quasicrystals using two alternative\napproaches [36\u201339], and even extended to treat novel long-range order possessing color [40]\nor magnetic symmetry [41, 42]); and many fundamental problems-including Bak's famous\nquestion: \"Where are the atoms?\" [43]-are finding their solutions [44, 45]. Nevertheless,\nother important questions have remained unanswered to this day. Many of these-such as\nthe electronic and other physical properties of quasicrystals [46], the surface science of quasicrystals [47], and the importance of the phason degree of freedom [48]-were hotly debated\nat the \"Silver Jubilee\" conference [28], and continue to drive us forward. One particularly\ninteresting set of questions, and the focus of this chapter, deals with metamaterials and\nsoft-matter quasicrystals-the newly added members of the quasicrystal family.\nWe know today that quasicrystals are more common than one had originally expected.\nScores, or even hundreds, of binary and ternary metallic alloys are known to form quasicrystalline phases [49]-mostly with icosahedral or decagonal point-group symmetry-and more\nare continuously being discovered. Nevertheless, it is only in the last few years that quasicrystals have been discovered (independently) in two different soft-matter systems: micelleforming dendrimers [50\u201352] and three-armed star block copolymers [53\u201355]. These newly\ndiscovered soft quasicrystals not only provide exciting alternative experimental platforms for\nthe basic study of quasiperiodic long-range order, but also hold the promise for new applications based on self-assembled nanomaterials [56\u201358], with unique electronic or photonic\nproperties that take advantage of the quasiperiodicity, which is relevant to our focus here.\nThe current emphasis in the study of soft-matter quasicrystals is to find an explanation\nfor their thermodynamic stability, and thus learn how to control their self-assembly. To this\ndate, soft quasicrystals have been observed only with dodecagonal point-group symmetry.\nTheir source of stability is therefore likely to be different from their solid-state siblings, yet\na good understanding of the stability of one quasiperiodic system may help to understand\n4\n\n\fNanotechnology and Quasicrystals\n\nRon Lifshitz\n\nthe stability of the other. In what follows I shall review our initial understanding of what\nmight be the source of stability of soft quasicrystals, while providing a concise background on\nthe subject. I will try to emphasize the important relations between the variety of different\nphysical and chemical systems that form quasicrystalline phases-atomic quasicrystals, soft\nquasicrystals, surface waves, and also artificially-produced structures and metamaterials.\n\n3\n\nQuasicrystals-Terminology and general framework\n\nLet us consider a scalar function \u03c1(r) that describes the electronic density or the ionic potential of a material. The Fourier transform of a quasiperiodic density \u03c1(r) has the form\nX\n\u03c1(k)eik*r ,\n(1)\n\u03c1(r) =\nk\u2208L\n\nwhere the (reciprocal) lattice L is a finitely generated Z-module, i.e. it can be expressed as\nthe set of all integral linear combinations of a finite number D of d-dimensional wave vectors,\nb(1) , . . . , b(D) . In the special case where D, called the rank of the crystal, is equal to the\nphysical dimension d, the crystal is periodic. We refer to all quasiperiodic crystals that are\nnot periodic as \"quasicrystals\".1 This term was first coined by Levine and Steinhardt [59,60]\nin the first of a series of important theoretical papers that were published in the eighties.\nIt is useful to introduce a physical setting based on the notion of symmetry breaking that\nwas mentioned earlier [12, 13, 62]. Let us assume that the quasiperiodically-ordered state,\ndescribed by \u03c1(r), is a symmetry-broken stable ground state of some generic free energy\nF , invariant under all translations and rotations in Rd . This is the same as saying that\nthe physical interactions giving rise to the quasicrystal are themselves translationally and\nrotationally invariant, and that the ground state breaks this symmetry. The free energy F\nis a functional of \u03c1(r), which in Fourier space takes the general form\nF {\u03c1} =\n\n\u221e X\nX\n\nn=2 k1 ...kn\n\nA(k1 , . . . kn )\u03c1(k1 ) * * * \u03c1(kn ).\n\n(2)\n\nBased on the idea of such a generic free energy, Rokhsar, Wright, and Mermin [36] introduced\nthe notion of indistinguishability, namely that two functions \u03c1(r) and \u03c1\u2032 (r) are indistinguishable if a generic free energy cannot distinguish between them and assigns them both the\nsame value. It then follows [36\u201338] that \u03c1(r) and \u03c1\u2032 (r) are indistinguishable if and only if\n\u2200k \u2208 L :\n\n\u03c1\u2032 (k) = e2\u03c0i\u03c7(k) \u03c1(k),\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03c7(k), called a gauge function, has the property that \u03c7(k1 + k2 ) \u2261 \u03c7(k1 ) + \u03c7(k2 )\n1\n\nSome older texts require crystals to possess so-called \"forbidden symmetries\" in order to be regarded as\nquasicrystals. It is now understood that such a requirement is inappropriate. See Ref. [35] for details, and\nRef. [61] for examples of square and cubic quasicrystals.\n\n5\n\n\fNanotechnology and Quasicrystals\n\nRon Lifshitz\n\nwhenever k1 and k2 are in L, where '\u2261' denotes equality to within an additive integer.\nGauge functions are useful in describing the relations between the different symmetrybroken ground states of F . Dr\u00e4ger and Mermin [63] showed that gauge functions form a\nvector space V \u2217 of all real-valued linear functions on the lattice L, and because L has rank\nD, V \u2217 is a D-dimensional vector space over the real numbers. The space V \u2217 contains, as a\nsubspace, all the integral-valued linear functions on L. This subset, which has the algebraic\nstructure of a rank-D Z-module (just like L itself) is denoted by L\u2217 . Gauge functions in L\u2217\nleave the ground-state density invariant. Gauge functions that belong to the quotient space\nV \u2217 /L\u2217 take the ground state described by \u03c1 into a different, yet indistinguishable, ground\nstate described by some other density function \u03c1\u2032 . Thus, one can parameterize all the related\nsymmetry-broken ground states of F on a simple D-torus-the order parameter space V \u2217 /L\u2217 .\nDifferent, yet indistinguishable, ground states may also be related by rotations g \u2208 O(d).\nIn this case \u03c1\u2032 in (3) is simply a rotated version of \u03c1, and for each such rotation g there is a\nspecial gauge function \u03c6g , called a phase function, satisfying\n\u2200k \u2208 L :\n\n\u03c1(gk) = e2\u03c0i\u03c6g (k) \u03c1(k).\n\n(4)\n\nThe set of all rotations satisfying (4) forms the point group of the crystal, and along with the\ncorresponding phase functions completely characterizes its space group [36\u201338,40\u201342]. Unlike\nperiodic crystals, quasicrystals are not restricted in the order of their rotational symmetry.\nThe point-group condition (4) is applicable to operations of any order (as long as the rank\nof the crystal is finite). Thus, in general, g may be an n-fold rotation of any order n.\n\n4\n\nExploiting quasicrystalline order in artificially constructed metamaterials\n\nInteresting applications are starting to emerge lately that take advantage of quasiperiodic\nlong-range order in metamaterials, or artificially constructed quasicrystals [64]. Two main\nfeatures distinguish quasicrystals from periodic crystals in the practical sense of using them\nas metamaterials. The first and more obvious is the relaxation of any symmetry constraints.\nIn dealing with quasicrystals for over a quarter of a century we have learned how to design\nstructures with axes of symmetry of arbitrarily high order. Of course, as the order of symmetry increases, so does the rank of the crystal and therefore its complexity. Nevertheless,\nsimple rank-4 2-dimensional structures already allow one to construct structures with axes\nof 5-fold, 8-fold, 10-fold, and 12-fold symmetry-a substantial improvement over the limited\n2-fold, 3-fold, 4-fold, and 6-fold axes possible with periodic crystals. Most applications of\nquasicrysalline metamaterials to date are thus based on this notion. These are mostly linear\nphotonic crystals, where quasiperiodic modulations of the index of refraction of different materials are used in order to engineer their optical response. These applications take advantage\nof the fact that there are no restrictions on the order of the rotational symmetry in order\nto obtain nearly-isotropic photonic band gaps [65, 66]. Dodecagonal (12-fold) quasicrystals\n6\n\n\fNanotechnology and Quasicrystals\n\nRon Lifshitz\n\nare particularly useful as they are at the same time quite simple (the rank is only 4) yet the\ndodecagon is a far better approximation of a circle than the hexagon, which is the best one\ncan achieve with periodic photonic crystals. Initial work is also carried out with phononic\nquasicrystals for controlling the propagation of sound waves [64].\nThe second feature of quasicrystals, useful for metamaterial applications, is the complete relaxation of any constraints on the positions of Bragg peaks in their diffraction diagrams. One may design quasiperiodic metamaterials in which the Bragg peaks are placed\nat predetermined positions in Fourier space. We have exploited this idea in the nonlinear\noptical domain [67\u201369], where recent technological progress has enabled to modulate the\nsecond-order nonlinear susceptibility with micron-scale resolution in various materials, such\nas ferroelectrics, semiconductors, and polymers. In these nonlinear photonic crystals the\nmodulation can be achieved by planar techniques, thereby offering either one or two dimensions for modulation. Moreover, there are no photonic bandgaps in these metamaterials,\nbecause the first-order susceptibility, and hence the refractive index, remain constant. We\nemphasize that the advantage of using quasicrystals in this case is not in their arbitrarilyhigh symmetry, but rather in the fact that there is no restriction on the combinations of\nwave vectors that may appear in their reciprocal lattices (provided that the symmetry of the\nquasicrystal is not of particular importance [38, 70]).\nThe novel optical devices that we have been developing are based on materials that\nfacilitate the nonlinear interaction between light waves in the form of three-wave mixing.\nThese are processes in which two incoming waves of frequencies \u03c91 and \u03c92 interact through\nthe quadratic dielectric tensor \u03c7(2) of the material to produce a third wave of frequency\n\u03c93 = \u03c91 \u00b1 \u03c92 ; or the opposite processes in which a single wave spontaneously breaks up into\ntwo. Three-wave mixing is severely constrained in dispersive materials, where \u03c9(k) is not a\nlinear function, because the interacting photons must also conserve their total momentum.\nEven the slightest wave-vector mismatch \u2206k = k1 \u00b1 k2 \u2212 k3 appears as an oscillating phase\nthat averages out the outgoing wave, giving rise to the so-called \"phase-matching problem.\"\nWe have explained how one could fully solve the most general phase-matching problem using\nwell-known ideas from the theory of quasicrystals [67]. The solution is based on the idea\nthat in crystals, whether periodic or not, continuous translation symmetry is broken, as\ndescribed above in Sec. 3. As a consequence, momentum conservation is replaced by the lessrestrictive conservation law of crystal momentum whereby momentum need only be conserved\nto within a wave vector from the reciprocal lattice of the crystal. The fabrication of an efficient\nfrequency-conversion device is therefore a matter of reciprocal-lattice engineering-designing\nan artificial crystal, from the quadratic dielectric field of the material \u03c7(2) (r), whose reciprocal\nlattice contains any desired set of mismatch wave vectors \u2206k(j) , j = 1 . . . N, required for\nphase matching any arbitrary combination of N three-wave mixing processes.\nThe idea of using a one-dimensional periodic modulation of the relevant component of the\nquadratic dielectric tensor, for the purpose of phase matching a single three-wave process, was\nsuggested already in the early 1960's [71\u201373], and is termed \"quasi-phase matching\". Since\nthen this approach has been generalized using more elaborate one-dimensional [74\u201376] and\ntwo-dimensional [77\u201380] designs, but only as ad hoc solutions for multiple processes. We have\n7\n\n\fNanotechnology and Quasicrystals\n\nRon Lifshitz\n\ndemonstrated that engineering the reciprocal lattice of a nonlinear photonic quasicrystal to\ncontain any desired set of mismatch vectors-a task that 25 years of research in quasicrystals\nhave taught us how to solve-provides the most general solution for the long-standing problem\nof multiple phase-matching [67]. We described elsewhere [68, 69] a number of novel optical\ndevices that have actually been fabricated using these ideas, and tested experimentally. These\ndevices attest to the general nature of the quasicrystal-based solution to the multiple phasematching problem.\n\n5\n\nTowards self-assembly of quasicrystalline nanostructures \u2013 The recent discovery of soft-matter quasicrystals\n\nAn important development accured recently with the experimental discovery that even soft\nmatter can self-assemble into structures with quasiperiodic long-range order.2 In one case,\ndendrimers that assume a conical shape assemble into micelles, which then pack to form\na perfect dodecagonal (12-fold) quasicrystal [50\u201352]. In another case, ABC star-shaped\nblock terpolymers-in which the length ratios of the three arms, B/A and C/A, can be\nchemically-controlled-assemble into a host of 2-dimensional columnar structures, one of\nwhich is, again, a dodecagonal quasicrystal [53\u201355]. This phase has also been reproduced\nnumerically using lattice Monte Carlo simulations [87]. A similar square-triangle tiling has\nalso been observed in a liquid crystal composed of T-shaped molecules [88], which forms yet\na third soft system which may potentially self-assemble into a dodecagonal quasicrystal. The\ncharacteristic length of the basic building blocks ranges in these systems from about 10 to\nabout 100 nanometers-2 to 3 orders of magnitude greater than the atomic length scales\nfound in solid-state quasicrystals. This property of soft quasicrystals is what will potentially\nmake them useful as functional self-assembled nanomaterials [56\u201358], and at the same time as\na new experimental platform for detailed-real-space and real-time-study of quasiperiodic\nlong-range order.\nInvestigations of these new soft members of the quasicrystal family of materials, are only\nat their infancy. For example, even the space groups of the observed phases have not been\ndetermined, although from the diffraction patterns of the dendrimer liquid crystals given by\nZeng et al. [50, 51] it seems that they have a 12-fold screw axis, and therefore, most likely,\nthe nonsymmorphic space group P 126 /mcm [37]. More generally, the same questions [46\u201348]\nconcerning the thermodynamic stability, the role of clusters in formation and dynamics, and\nthe importance of phasons, apply to soft quasicrystals as they do to hard quasicrystals.\n2\n\nFor the sake of historical accuracy, it should be noted that at some point the blue phase III of liquid\ncrystals, also known as the \"blue fog\", was thought to have icosahedral quasicrystalline order [81,82], but this\neventually turned out not to be the case [83, 84]. Also, incommensurate helical twist-grain-boundary phases\nare known to exist in smectic liquid crystals [85, 86], but the quasiperiodic order in this case is essentially\nonly along the 1-dimensional screw axis.\n\n8\n\n\fNanotechnology and Quasicrystals\n\nRon Lifshitz\n\nYet the answers may be more tractable (albeit possibly different as the systems are quite\ndifferent). Thus, the study of soft quasicrystals will clearly have implications well beyond the\nlimits of the specific soft systems that have been discovered so far, and is likely to promote\nthe fundamental understanding of quasicrystals in general. Fortunately, the study of soft\nquasicrystals is happening at a point in time when the science of quasicrystals is ready and\nmature to tackle these newly discovered systems. We are no longer taken by surprise whenever\na new chemical or physical system exhibits quasicrystalline structure. We are prepared with\nthe appropriate tools to study and explore it, and hopefully also to exploit it for the control\nof the self-assembly of useful nanomaterials.\n\n6\n\nInsights from an even softer system \u2013 Quasicrystalline surface waves\n\nMotivated by experiments with parametrically-excited surface waves (Faraday waves), exhibiting dodecagonal quasiperiodic order [89], Lifshitz and Petrich [90] developed some years\nago a model for describing the pattern-forming dynamics of a two-dimensional field in which\ntwo length scales undergo a simultaneous instability. This model is an extension of the SwiftHohenberg equation [91], which is used for describing a variety of different pattern-forming\nsystems [92]. Its dynamics is relaxational, \u2202t \u03c1 = \u2212\u03b4F /\u03b4\u03c1, driving a 2-dimensional field\n\u03c1(x, y, t) towards the minimum of an \"effective free energy\" (2),\nZ\n1\n1\n1\n1\n(5)\nFLP {\u03c1} = dx dy {\u2212 \u03b5\u03c12 + [(\u22072 + 1)(\u22072 + q 2 )\u03c1]2 \u2212 \u03b1\u03c13 + \u03c14 },\n2\n2\n3\n4\nyielding a dynamical equation of the form\n\u2202t \u03c1 = \u03b5\u03c1 \u2212 (\u22072 + 1)2 (\u22072 + q 2 )2 \u03c1 + \u03b1\u03c12 \u2212 \u03c13 .\n\n(6)\n\nIt essentially mimics the dynamics of a generic 2-dimensional material in search of its ground\nstate, and therefore offers us important insight and a good starting point for our current\ninvestigation of soft quasicrystals. A Java simulation of the dynamical equation (6), starting\nfrom random initial conditions, and arriving at a quasicrystalline pattern can be found at\nhttp://www.its.caltech.edu/\u223cmcc/Patterns/Demo4 6.html.\nThe Lifshitz-Petrich free energy FLP is indeed generic, imposing only two requirements\non a material, described by a 2-dimensional density \u03c1(x, y, t): (a) The existence of two\ncharacteristic length scales, whose ratio is given by the parameter q; and (b) The existence\nof effective 3-body interactions, whose importance is given by the relative strength of the\nparameter \u03b1. In [90] we were able to show analytically (using standard methods p\n[93, ch. 4.7]\n\u221a\nand [94]), and demonstrate numerically, that if q is chosen around 2 cos(\u03c0/12) = 2 + 3 \u2243\n1.932 one can obtain a ground state with quasiperiodic long-range order and dodecagonal\nsymmetry, yet no choice of q yields globally-stable ground states with octagonal or decagonal\n\n9\n\n\fNanotechnology and Quasicrystals\n\nRon Lifshitz\n\nsymmetry. The latter two have insufficient triplets of wave vectors in the Fourier Lattice L\n[Eq. (1)] that add up to zero to overcome the cost of additional density modes, as compared\nwith the hexagonal state. Thus, in two dimensions, the requirements of two length scales and\n3-body interactions are sufficient to stabilize dodecagonal quasicrystals, but insufficient to\nstabilize octagonal or decagonal quasicrystals. This raises the possibility that the fact that\nthe soft quasicrystals discovered to date are all dodecagonal, may be accounted for using\na free energy similar to FLP . Note that for hard quasicrystals the situation is different-\ndecagonal quasicrystals are thermodynamically stable whereas octagonal and dodecagonal\nquasicrystals are believed to be metastable-indicating that the stabilization mechanism for\nsoft quasicrystals might be quite different from that of hard quasicrystals.\n\n7\n\nValidity of density-wave theories of quasicrystals\n\nAt the outset, as we argue in more detail elsewhere [95], the experimental soft systems in\nwhich quasicrystalline order has been observed seem to satisfy the basic assumptions of the\nLifshitz-Petrich theory described in Sec. 6. The asymmetric and heterogeneous structure of\nthe star polymers and dendrimers will most likely require more than one length scale for\nan appropriate coarse-grained description.3 Their ultra-soft repulsion and resulting strong\ninter-penetration [99\u2013105] imply that 3-body interactions should be significant [106]. Thus,\nwe expect that studies that we are currently undertaking will yield functionals similar in\nnature to FLP of Eq. (5). Significant differences may emerge, nonetheless, as the systems\nconsidered here are 3-dimensional and differ in their microscopic structure. For instance,\ntwo order parameters rather than one might be required [55], which could potentially allow\npoint-group symmetries other than dodecagonal to be observed.4\nAnother key insight can be drawn from a recent theoretical observation, according to\nwhich dispersions of soft, fuzzy, particles are essentially different in their thermodynamics\nfrom those of hard particles [107, 108]. The overlap of the soft \"coronas\" surrounding the\nparticles leads to a driving force acting to minimize their interfacial area, in analogy with\nfoams. Consequently, unusual liquid-crystalline structures can be stabilized in systems of\nsoft spheres [107\u2013110]. Both star polymers and flexible dendrimers fall into this fuzzy category [111, 112], yet they may be highly aspherical. Likos et al. [104] have also shown that\nstars and flexible dendrimers have the same kind of soft pair potentials. We thus expect such\nconsiderations of interfacial-area minimization to become highly relevant in the study of soft\nquasicrystals.\nA 3-dimensional version of an LP-like free energy may remind the reader of the early\nattempts by Kalugin, Kitaev, and Levitov [113, KKL], who extended the model of Alexander\n3\n\nIndeed, coarse-grained free energies previously used for amphiphilic self-assembly [96] involve more than\none characteristic length scale due to the asymmetry of the molecules and the resulting tendency to form\ncurved interfaces.\n4\nModels with two order parameters were suggested also for hard quasicrystals [97] and pattern-forming\nsystems [98], yielding additional quasicrystalline ground-state symmetries.\n\n10\n\n\fNanotechnology and Quasicrystals\n\nRon Lifshitz\n\nand McTague [114], using density-wave theories to establish that the icosahedral quasicrystal\nhas lower free energy than the competing bcc phase. Narasimhan and Ho [115, NH] managed\nto show in their model that there are regions in parameter space in which a dodecagonal\nquasicrystal is favored and other regions in which a decagonal quasicrystal is favored. These\nattempts were eventually discontinued after it was shown by Gronlund and Mermin [94] that\nthe addition of a quartic term to the cubic free energy of KKL reverses the outcome of the\ncalculation, establishing the bcc phase as the favored one. For hard crystals it is unclear where\nto truncate the density-wave expansion of the free energy and whether such a truncation is\nfully justified. As we discussed in [95], for the soft systems considered here the truncation of\nthe expansion should be more valid. We are therefore in a position now to reexamine some\nof the old conclusions, based on density-wave theories of quasicrystals, as they are likely to\napply to soft quasicrystals. Roan and Shakhnovich [116] performed such a stability study\nfor the case of icosahedral order in diblock copolymers and concluded that such order is only\nmetastable. Nevertheless, we are encouraged by the old results of NH who established the\nstability of dodecagonal, as well as decagonal, quasicrystals within the same model.\n\n8\n\nDislocation and phason dynamics \u2013 From soft to photonic quasicrystals\n\nValuable knowledge about the nature of quasiperiodic order, important also for the control\nof its self-assembly, can be obtained by studying its topological defects [12, 13, 117], and its\nlow-energy collective excitations-in particular those associated with the phason degrees of\nfreedom. Much like phonons, phasons are low-energy excitations of the quasicrystal, only\nthat instead of slightly shifting the atoms away from their equilibrium positions, the relative\npositions of atoms are interchanged. Their existence stems directly from the fact that the\ndimension D of the order parameter space V \u2217 /L\u2217 is greater than the physical dimension d.\nThus, in addition to d independent (acoustic) phonon modes there are D \u2212 d independent\nphason modes.\nThe existence of phasons as fundamental degrees of freedom, affecting the physical behavior of quasicrystals, has been clearly established over the years. Their role in a dynamical\ndensity-wave theory of quasicrystals was developed in a series of papers [9, 118\u2013124] immediately following the announcement of the discovery of quasicrystals. Phasons have been\nobserved in numerous experiments, whether directly or indirectly, throughout the past two\ndecades [125\u2013129, for example], and are still a source of interesting analytical puzzles [130]\nand ongoing debate [48].\nWe have recently begun investigating the motion of dislocations and the dynamics of\nphasons in the dodecagonal ground state of the LP equation [131]. We are studying, both\nanalytically and numerically, such questions as the climb velocity of dislocations under strain,\nthe pinning of dislocations by the underlying quasiperiodic structure under conditions of weak\ndiffusion, and the relaxation of phason strain as two dislocations of opposite topological sign\nmerge and annihilate each other. These studies are impossible to conduct with either Faraday\n11\n\n\fNanotechnology and Quasicrystals\n\nRon Lifshitz\n\nwaves or hard atomic quasicrstals. Thus soft quasicrystals, with their 10nm to 100nm length\nscales, may become one of the first natural experimental system to provide real quantitative\nmicroscopic answers regarding the dynamics of the fundamental degrees of freedom in a\nquasicrystal-defects and low-energy excitations.\nIn the meantime we have embarked on the study of these unique dynamical degrees of\nfreedom in a facsinating new artificial form of quasicrystalline medium-an optically-induced\nnonlinear photonic quasicrystal-which we have recently demonstrated [132]. In this systems\nbeams of light inetract nonlinearly by changing the index of refraction of a photorefractive\nmaterial. Their dynamics is governed by a different type of equation-the so-called nonlinear\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation. Nevertheless, it is capable of stabilizing structures with quasicrystalline order where the typical distance between crystal sites is 15\u03bcm to 30\u03bcm. This has\nallowed us to study the microscopic dynamics of dislocations [132] as well as phasons [133].\nThese artificial systems already provide useful information reagrding the dynamics of fundamental degrees of freedom in quasicrystals. Similar investigations of soft quasicrystals, should\nprovide valuable insight into their physical nature, as well as that of all quasicrystals, regardless of the physical or chemical system in which they are realized. This insight will be most\nvaluable in trying to design and control the self assembly of quasiperiodic nanomaterials.\n\nAcknowledgments\nI would like to thank Alexey Madison, Yuri Magarshak, and Sergey Kozirev for inviting me to\nSt. Petersburg, where I was encouraged to stress the connections between my different fields\nof research-nanotechnology and quasicrystals.
