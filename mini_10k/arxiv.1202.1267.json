[BC, page 278]) asked the following question on complete\nintersections over the field C of complex numbers. In this note, the field C is taken\nas the base field. By a variety, we mean a complex quasiprojective (reduced) (but\nnot necessarily irreducible) variety.\nQuestion 1.1. Let Ct \u2282 P3 be a family of smooth curves parameterized by the\nformal disc D := spec R, where R is the formal power series ring C[[t]] in one\nvariable. Assume that the general member of the family is a complete intersection.\nThen, is the special member C0 also a complete intersection?\nBy using a construction due to Serre, the above problem is equivalent to the\nfollowing (cf. [Ku]).\nQuestion 1.2. Let Vt be a family of rank two vector bundles on P3 . Assume that\nthe general member of the family is a direct sum of line bundles. Then, is the\nspecial member V0 also a direct sum of line bundles?\nLet us consider the following slightly weaker version of the above question.\nQuestion 1.3. Let Vt be a family of rank two vector bundles on P3 . Assume that\nthe general member of the family is a trivial vector bundle. Then, is the special\nmember V0 also a trivial vector bundle?\nIn the next section, we show that the above question is equivalent to a question on the nonexistence of algebraic maps from P3 to the infinite Grassmannian\nX associated to the affine SL(2). Specifically, we have the following result (cf.\nTheorem 2.5):\n1\n\n\fTheorem 1.4. Let X be any irreducible projective variety. Then, the following\ntwo conditions are equivalent:\n(a) Any rank-2 vector bundle F on X \u00d7 D with trivial determinant, such that\nF|X\u00d7D\u2217 is trivial, is itself trivial.\n(b) There exists no nonconstant morphism X \u2192 X.\nThus, Question 1.3 is equivalent to the following question (cf. Question 2.6):\nQuestion 1.5. Does there exist no nonconstant morphism P3 \u2192 X?\nLet Mord\u2217 (P1 , X) denote the set of base point preserving morphisms from P1 \u2192\nX of degree d. It is a complex algebraic variety. As we show in Section 3, any\nmorphism \u03c6 : P3 \u2192 X of degree d, preserving the base points, canonically induces\na morphism\n\u03c6\u0302 : C3 \\{0} \u2192 Mord\u2217 (P1 , X).\nLet Md be the set of isomorphism classes of rank two vector bundles V over P2\nwith trivial determinant and with second Chern class d together with a trivialization of V|P1 . Then, Md has a natural variety structure, which will be referred to by\nthe Donaldson moduli space. Donaldson showed that there is a natural diffeomorphism between Md and the instanton moduli space Id of Yang-Mills d-instantons\nover the flat R4 with group S U(2) modulo based gauge equivalence. As shown by\nAtiyah, there is a natural embedding\ni : Mord\u2217 (P1 , X) \u0592\u2192 Md\nas an open subset (cf. Proposition 3.1). Thus, the morphism \u03c6\u0302 gives rise to a\nmorphism (still denoted by) \u03c6\u0302 : C3 \\{0} \u2192 Md . Define an action of C\u2217 on C3 \\{0}\nby homothecy and on P2 via:\nz * [\u03bb, \u03bc, \u03bd] = [z\u22121 \u03bb, \u03bc, \u03bd].\nThis gives rise to an action of C\u2217 on Md via the pull-back of bundles. Then, the\nembedding \u03c6\u0302 is C\u2217 -equivariant (cf. Theorem 3.2).\nWe would like to make the following conjecture (cf. Conjecture 3.3).\nConjecture 1.6. For any d > 0, there does not exist any C\u2217 -equivariant morphism\nf\u02c6 : C3 \\{0} \u2192 Md .\nAssuming the validity of the above conjecture 1.6, we get that there is no\nnonconstant morphism \u03c6 : P3 \u2192 X.\n2\n\n\fThus, by Theorem 1.4, assuming the validity of the above Conjecture 1.6, any\nrank-2 bundle F on P3 \u00d7 D with trivial determinant, such that F|P3 \u00d7D\u2217 is trivial, is\nitself trivial (cf. Corollary 3.4).\nAs a generalization of the above, we would like to make the following conjecture (cf. Conjecture 3.5).\nConjecture 1.7. For any n \u2265 2, let Xn be the infinite Grassmannian associated\nto the group G = SL(n), i.e., Xn := SL(n, K)/ SL(n, R). Then, there does not exist\nany nonconstant morphism \u03c6 : Pn+1 \u2192 Xn .\nFinally, in Section 4, we recall an explicit construction of the moduli space Md\nvia the monad construction and show that the C\u2217 -action on Md takes a relatively\nsimple form (cf. Lemma 4.3).\nAcknowledgements. It is my pleasure to thank N. Mohan Kumar, who brought to\nmy attention the Koll\u00e1r-Peskine problem and with whom I had several very helpful\nconversations/correspondences. I also thank J. Koll\u00e1r for a correspondence. This\nwork was partially supported by the NSF grant DMS-0901239.\n\n2 Koll\u00e1r-Peskine problem and infinite Grassmannian\nFor more details on the following construction of the infinite Grassmannians, see\n[K, Chapter 13].\nSet G = SL(2, K), P = SL(2, R), where K := C[[t]][t\u22121 ] denotes the ring of\nLaurent series in one variable and R is the subring C[[t]] of power series. The\nring homomorphism R \u2192 C, t 7\u2192 0, gives rise to a group homomorphism \u03c0 :\nP \u2192 SL(2, C). Define B = \u03c0\u22121 (B), where B \u2282 SL(2, C) is the Borel subgroup\nconsisting of the upper triangular matrices. For any d \u2265 0, define\n!\n[d\ntn 0\nXd =\nP/P \u2282 G/P.\nB\nn=0\n0 t\u2212n\nThen, Xd admits a natural structure of a projective variety and \u222ad\u22650 Xd = G/P.\nMoreover, Xd is irreducible (of dimension d), and Xd \u0592\u2192 Xd+1 is a closed embedding. In particular, X := G/P is a projective ind-variety.\nFor any integer d \u2265 0, consider the set Ld of R-submodules L \u2282 K \u2297C V such\nthat\ntd Lo \u2282 L \u2282 t\u2212d Lo , and dimC (L/td Lo ) = 2d,\n3\n\n\fwhere V := C2 and Lo := R \u2297 V. Let\nL := \u222ad\u22650 Ld .\nAny element of L is called an R-lattice in K \u2297C V.\nThe group SL(2, K) acts canonically on K \u2297C V. Recall the following from [K,\nLemma 13.2.14].\nLemma 2.1. The map g SL(2, R) 7\u2192 gLo (for g \u2208 SL(2, K)) induces a bijection\n\u03b2 : X \u2192 L.\nLet X be any irreducible projective variety and let F be a rank two vector\nbundle on X \u00d7 D with trivial determinant, where D := spec R. Fix a trivialization\nof the determinant of F . Assume that F|X\u00d7D\u2217 is trivial, D\u2217 being the punctured\nformal disc D\u2217 := spec K. Fix a compatible trivialization \u03c4 of F|X\u00d7D\u2217 (compatible\nwith the trivialization of the determinant of F ). For any x \u2208 X,\nH 0 (x \u00d7 D, F ) \u0592\u2192 H 0 (x \u00d7 D\u2217 , F ) \u2243 K \u2297C V.\nThus,\nLx := H 0 (x \u00d7 D, F ) \u0592\u2192 K \u2297C V.\nIt can be seen that Lx is an R-lattice in K \u2297C V. Moreover, the map x 7\u2192 Lx\nprovides a morphism \u03c6F (\u03c4) : X \u2192 X under the identification of Lemma 2.1\n(depending upon the trivialization \u03c4). If we choose a different compatible trivialization \u03c4\u2032 of the bundle F|X\u00d7D\u2217 , it is easy to see that the morphism \u03c6F (\u03c4\u2032 ) differs\nfrom \u03c6F (\u03c4) by the left multiplication of an element g \u2208 G, i.e.,\n\u03c6F (\u03c4\u2032 )(x) = g\u03c6F (\u03c4)(x), for all x \u2208 X.\n(To prove this, observe that any morphism X \u00d7 D\u2217 \u2192 SL(2, C) is constant in the\nX-variable since X is an irreducible projective variety by assumption.)\nSet [\u03c6F ] as the equivalence class of the map \u03c6F (\u03c4) : X \u2192 X (for some compatible trivialization \u03c4), where two maps X \u2192 X are called equivalent if they differ\nby left multiplication by an element of G. Thus, [\u03c6F ] does not depend upon the\nchoice of the compatible trivialization \u03c4 of F|X\u00d7D\u2217 .\nLemma 2.2. The bundle F is trivial on X \u00d7 D if and only if the map [\u03c6F ] is a\nconstant map.\n\n4\n\n\fProof. If F is trivial on X \u00d7 D, then [\u03c6F ] is clearly a constant map. Conversely,\nassume that [\u03c6F ] is a constant map. Choose a compatible trivialization \u03c4 of F|X\u00d7D\u2217\nso that\nLx = Lo ,\n\u2200x \u2208 X.\nLet \u03c6 := \u03c6F (\u03c4). Take a basis {e1 , e2 } of V. This gives rise to unique sections\n\u03c31 (x), \u03c32 (x) \u2208 H 0 (x \u00d7 D, F ) corresponding to the elements 1 \u2297 e1 and 1 \u2297 e2\nrespectively under the map \u03c6. Let s1 , s2 \u2208 H 0 (X \u00d7 D\u2217 , F ) be everywhere linearly\nindependent sections such that \u03c3i (x)|x\u00d7D\u2217 = si|x\u00d7D\u2217 .\nIt suffices to show that \u03c31 (x), \u03c32 (x) are linearly independent at 0 as well. Take\na small open subset U \u2282 X so that the bundle F|U\u00d7D is trivial. Fix a compatible\ntrivialization \u03c4\u2032 of F|U\u00d7D . Then, the sections \u03c3i can be thought of as maps U \u00d7\n\u03c3\nbi\n\nD \u2212\u2192 V which are linearly independent over any point of U \u00d7 D\u2217 . From this it\nis easy to see that \u03c3\nbi are linearly independent over any point of U \u00d7 D since the\ntransition matrix over U \u00d7 D\u2217 with respect to the two trivializations \u03c4 and \u03c4\u2032 of\nF|U\u00d7D\u2217 has determinant 1. Covering X by such small open subsets U, the lemma\nis proved.\n\u0003\nAs above, a bundle F gives rise to a morphism \u03c6F : X \u2192 X (unique up to the\nleft multiplication by an element of G). Conversely, any morphism \u03c6 : X \u2192 X\ngives rise to a bundle F . Before we can prove this, we need the following result.\nLet V := P1 \u00d7 V \u2192 P1 be the trivial rank-2 vector bundle over P1 , where V\nis the two dimensional complex vector space C2 . For any g \u2208 G, define a rank-2\nlocally free sheaf Vg on P1 as the sheaf associated to the following presheaf:\nFor any Zariski open subset U \u2282 P1 , set\nVg (U) = H 0 (U, V), if 0 < U, and\nVg (U) = {\u03c3 \u2208 H 0 (U \\ {0}, V) : (\u03c3)0 \u2208 g(R \u2297C V)}, if 0 \u2208 U,\nwhere (\u03c3)0 denotes the germ of the rational section \u03c3 at 0 viewed canonically as\nan element of K \u2297C V.\nWith this notation, we have the following result from [KNR, Proposition 2.8].\n(In fact, we only give a particular case of loc. cit. for G = SL(2, C) and for the\ncurve C = P1 , which is sufficient for our purposes.):\nProposition 2.3. There is a rank-2 algebraic vector bundle U on X\u00d7P1 satisfying\nthe following:\n(1) The bundle U is of trivial determinant,\n(2) The bundle U is trivial restricted to X \u00d7 (P1 \\ {0}),\n5\n\n\f(3) For any x = gP \u2208 X (for g \u2208 G), the restriction U|x\u00d7P1 is isomorphic with\nthe locally free sheaf Vg as above.\nLemma 2.4. For any morphism \u03c6 : X \u2192 X, there exists a rank two vector bundle\nF\u03c6 on X \u00d7 D with trivial determinant (explicitly constructed in the proof) such that\nF\u03c6 |X\u00d7D\u2217 is trivial and such that the associated morphism [\u03c6F\u03c6 ] = [\u03c6].\nProof. As in Proposition 2.3, consider the vector bundle U on X \u00d7 P1 of rank two.\nLet U\u03c6 be the pull-back of the family U to X \u00d7 P1 via the morphism \u03c6 \u00d7 Id. Let F\u03c6\nbe the restriction of U\u03c6 to X \u00d7 D. Then, by the properties (1)-(2) of Proposition\n2.3, the bundle F\u03c6 satisfies the first two properties of the lemma. Finally, by the\nproperty (3) of Proposition 2.3 and the definition of the map [\u03c6F\u03c6 ], it is easy to see\nthat [\u03c6F\u03c6 ] = [\u03c6].\n\u0003\nCombining Lemmas 2.2 and 2.4, we get the following theorem:\nTheorem 2.5. Let X be any irreducible projective variety. Then, the following\ntwo conditions are equivalent:\n(a) Any rank-2 vector bundle F on X \u00d7 D with trivial determinant, such that\nF|X\u00d7D\u2217 is trivial, is itself trivial.\n(b) There exists no nonconstant morphism X \u2192 X.\nBy virtue of the above theorem, an affirmative answer of Question 1.3 is equivalent to an affirmative answer of the following question. Observe that under the\nassumptions of Question 1.3, the family Vt , thought of as a rank-2 vector bundle\nV on P3 \u00d7 D, has trivial determinant by virtue of [H, Exercise 12.6(b), Chap. III].\nAlso, V|P3 \u00d7D\u2217 is trivial by the semicontinuity theorem (cf. [H, \u00a712, Chap. III]).\nQuestion 2.6. Does there exist no nonconstant morphism P3 \u2192 X?\nDefinition 2.7. Recall (cf. [K, Proposition 13.2.19 and its proof]) that the singular\nhomology H2 (X, Z) \u2243 Z and it has a canonical generator given by the Schubert\ncycle of complex dimension 1. For any morphism \u03c6 : P3 \u2192 X, define its degree\nto be the integer d = d\u03c6 such that the induced map in homology \u03c6\u2217 : H2 (P3 , Z) \u2192\nH2 (X, Z) induced by \u03c6 is given via multiplication by d.\nSince the pull-back of the ample generator of Pic X \u2243 H 2 (X, Z) (which is\nglobally generated) is a globally generated line bundle on P3 , d \u2265 0 and d = 0 if\nand only if \u03c6 is a constant map.\nFor any rank-2 bundle F on P3 \u00d7 D with trivial determinant such that F|X\u00d7D\u2217\nis trivial, we define its deformation index d(F ) = d[\u03c6F ] .\n6\n\n\fProposition 2.8. For any morphism \u03c6 : P3 \u2192 X, d\u03c6 is divisible by 6.\nEquivalently, for any F as in the above definition, d(F ) is divisible by 6.\nProof. Consider the induced algebra homomorphism in cohomology:\n\u03c6\u2217 : H \u2217 (X, Z) \u2192 H \u2217 (P3 , Z),\ninduced by \u03c6. By the definition, the induced map at H 2 is multiplication by d\u03c6 .\nMoreover, by [K, Exercise 11.3.E.4], for any i \u2265 0, H 2i (X, Z) is a free Z-module\nof rank 1 generated by the Schubert class \u01ebi . Moreover,\n!\ni+ j\n\u01ebi+ j .\n\u01ebi * \u01eb j =\ni\nIn particular, 6\u01eb3 = \u01eb13 . From this the proposition follows.\n\n\u0003\n\n3 Koll\u00e1r-Peskine problem and the instanton moduli\nspace\nTake any morphism \u03c6 : P3 \u2192 X, with degree d = d\u03c6 . Assume that \u03c6([0, 0, 0, 1]) is\nthe base point xo := 1 * P \u2208 X.\nDefine the map\n\u03c0 : C3 \\{0} \u00d7 P1 \u2212\u2192 P3 , (x, [\u03bb, \u03bc]) 7\u2212\u2192 [\u03bbx, \u03bc],\nfor x \u2208 C3 \\{0} and [\u03bb, \u03bc] \u2208 P1 . There is an action of C\u2217 on C3 \\{0} \u00d7 P1 by\n\u0011\n\u0001 \u0010\n1\nz * x, [\u03bb, \u03bc] = zx, [ \u03bb, \u03bc] , for z \u2208 C\u2217 .\nz\n\nThen, \u03c0 factors through the C\u2217 -orbits. Consider the composite morphism\n\u03c6\u0304 = \u03c6 \u25e6 \u03c0 : C3 \\{0} \u00d7 P1 \u2192 X.\nObserve that \u03c6\u0304(x, 0) = xo for any x \u2208 C3 \\{0}, where 0 \u2208 P1 is the point [0, 1].\nLet Mord\u2217 (P1 , X) denote the set of base point preserving morphisms from P1 \u2192\nX of degree d (taking 0 to xo ). Then, as in [A, \u00a7 2], Mord\u2217 (P1 , X) acquires the\nstructutre of a complex algebraic variety.\nThe map \u03c6\u0304 canonically induces the morphism\n\u03c6\u0302 : C3 \\{0} \u2192 Mord\u2217 (P1 , X).\n7\n\n\fLet us consider the embedding P1 \u0592\u2192 P2 , [\u03bb, \u03bc] 7\u2192 [\u03bb, \u03bc, 0]. Fix d \u2265 0 and let\nMd be the set of isomorphism classes of rank two vector bundles V over P2 with\ntrivial determinant and with second Chern class d together with a trivialization\nof V|P1 . The isomorphism is required to preserve the trivialization of V over\nP1 . Then, Md has a natural variety structure. Moreover, any bundle V \u2208 Md\nis semistable. (By [OSS, Chapter I, Lemma 3.2.2], V is trivial on generic lines\nl \u2282 P2 . Thus, by [OSS, Chapter II, Lemma 2.2.1], V is semistable.) We will\nrefer to Md as the Donaldson moduli space. Donaldson [D] showed that there\nis a natural diffeomorphism between Md and the instanton moduli space Id of\nYang-Mills d-instantons over the flat R4 with group S U(2) modulo based gauge\nequivalence.\nDefine an action of C\u2217 on Mord\u2217 (P1 , X) via:\n(z * \u03b3)[\u03bb, \u03bc] = \u03b3[z\u03bb, \u03bc],\n\n(1)\n\nfor z \u2208 C\u2217 , \u03b3 \u2208 Mord\u2217 (P1 , X) and [\u03bb, \u03bc] \u2208 P1 .\nAlso, define the action of C\u2217 on P2 via:\nz * [\u03bb, \u03bc, \u03bd] = [z\u22121 \u03bb, \u03bc, \u03bd].\n\n(2)\n\nThis gives rise to an action of C\u2217 on Md via the pull-back of bundles, i.e., for\nV \u2208 Md , [X] \u2208 P2 , the fiber of z * V over [X] is given by:\n(z * V)[X] = Vz*[X].\n\n(3)\n\n(Observe that P1 \u0592\u2192 P2 is stable under C\u2217 and hence the trivialization of V|P1 pulls\nback to a trivialization.)\nRecall the following result from [A, \u00a7 2].\nProposition 3.1. There is a natural embedding\ni : Mord\u2217 (P1 , X) \u0592\u2192 Md\nas an open subset. Moreover, i is C\u2217 -equivariant with respect to the C\u2217 actions as\nin equations (1) and (3).\nThe following result summarizes the above discussion.\nTheorem 3.2. To any morphism \u03c6 : P3 \u2192 X of degree d preserving the base\npoints, there is a canonically associated C\u2217 -equivariant morphism (defined above)\n\u03c6\u0302 : C3 \\{0} \u2192 Md ,\nwhere C\u2217 acts on C3 \\{0} via the multiplication.\nMoreover, \u03c6 is constant (i.e., d = 0) iff \u03c6\u0302 is constant.\n8\n\n\fWe would like to make the following conjecture.\nConjecture 3.3. For any d > 0, there does not exist any C\u2217 -equivariant morphism\nf\u02c6 : C3 \\{0} \u2192 Md .\nAssuming the validity of the above conjecture, we get the following.\nCorollary 3.4. Assuming the validity of Conjecture 3.3, there does not exist any\nnonconstant morphism \u03c6 : P3 \u2192 X.\nThus, by Theorem 2.5, assuming the validity of Conjecture 3.3, any rank-2\nbundle F on P3 \u00d7 D with trivial determinant, such that F|P3 \u00d7D\u2217 is trivial, is itself\ntrivial.\nAs a generalization of the above corollary, I would like to make the following\nconjecture.\nConjecture 3.5. For any n \u2265 2, let Xn be the infinite Grassmannian associated\nto the group G = SL(n), i.e., Xn := SL(n, K)/ SL(n, R). Then, there does not exist\nany nonconstant morphism \u03c6 : Pn+1 \u2192 Xn .\nRemark 3.6. An interesting aspect of this approach is that Question 1.3 involving an arbitrary family of (not necessarily semistable) vector bundles on P3 is\nreduced to a question about the Donaldson moduli space Md consisting of rank\ntwo semistable bundles on P2 .\n\n4 Monad construction of Md\nThis section recalls an explicit construction of the moduli space Md via the monad\nconstruction. We refer to [OSS, \u00a7\u00a7 3,4, Chap. II] for more details on the monad\nconstruction (see also [B] and [Hu]).\nFix an integer d \u2265 0. Let H, K, L be complex vector spaces of dimensions\nd, 2d + 2, d respectively. By monad one means linear maps parameterized by\nZ \u2208 C3 , depending linearly on Z:\nAZ\n\nBZ\n\nH \u2192 K \u2192 L,\nsuch that the composite BZ \u25e6 AZ = 0, for all Z \u2208 C3 . The monad is said to be\nnondegenerate if for all Z \u2208 C3 \\ {0}, BZ is surjective and AZ is injective. In this\ncase, we get a vector bundle on P2 with fiber at the line [Z] the vector space\nE(A, B) := Ker BZ / Im AZ .\n9\n\n\fThen, any rank-2 bundle on P2 with the second Chern class d, which is trivial on\nsome line, is isomorphic with E(A, B), for some monad (A, B). Moreover, such a\nmonad (A, B) is unique up to the action of GL(H) \u00d7 GL(K) \u00d7 GL(L). Let [\u03bb, \u03bc, \u03bd]\nbe the homogeneous coordinates on P2 . If we only consider bundles on P2 trivial\non the fixed line \u03bd = 0, the condition on the corresponding monad is that the\ncomposite B\u03bb A\u03bc = \u2212B\u03bc A\u03bb is an isomorphism, where (for Z = (\u03bb, \u03bc, \u03bd))\nAZ := A\u03bb \u03bb + A\u03bc \u03bc + A\u03bd \u03bd, and BZ := B\u03bb\u03bb + B\u03bc \u03bc + B\u03bd \u03bd.\nIn the following, t denotes the transpose, Id\u00d7d denotes the identity matrix of size\nd \u00d7 d, 0d\u00d7d denotes the zero matrix of size d \u00d7 d and \u03b1, \u03b2, a and b are matrices of\nindicated sizes. For such bundles, using the action of GL(H) \u00d7 GL(K) \u00d7 GL(L),\none can choose bases for H, K, L so that the maps are given as follows.\n\u0001t\n\u0001t\n\u0001t\nA\u03bb = Id\u00d7d , 0d\u00d7d , 0d\u00d72 , A\u03bc = 0d\u00d7d , Id\u00d7d , 0d\u00d72 , A\u03bd = \u03b1td\u00d7d , \u03b2td\u00d7d , ad\u00d72 ,\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\nB\u03bb = 0d\u00d7d , Id\u00d7d , 0d\u00d72 , B\u03bc = \u2212Id\u00d7d , 0d\u00d7d , 0d\u00d72 , B\u03bd = \u2212\u03b2d\u00d7d , \u03b1d\u00d7d , bd\u00d72 ,\n\nand the following condition is satisfied:\n\nB\u03bd A\u03bd = 0, which is equivalent to the condition [\u03b1, \u03b2] + bat = 0.\nThe restriction of the bundle E(A, B) to the line \u03bd = 0 has a standard frame given\nby the last 2 basis vectors of K \u2243 C2d+2 .\nFor any d \u2265 0, let \u015cd be the closed subvariety of matrices (\u03b1, \u03b2, a, b) such that\n\u03b1, \u03b2 are d \u00d7 d matrices and a, b are d \u00d7 2 matrices and they satisfy:\n(1) [\u03b1, \u03b2] + bat = 0.\nLet Sd be the open subset of \u015cd satisfying, in addition, the following condition:\n\u0001t\n(2) For all \u03bb, \u03bc \u2208 C, \u03b1t + \u03bbId\u00d7d , \u03b2t + \u03bcId\u00d7d , a is injective and \u2212(\u03b2 + \u03bcId\u00d7d ), \u03b1 +\n\u0001\n\u03bbId\u00d7d , b is surjective.\nWe recall the following result due to Barth from [D, Proposition 1].\n\nTheorem 4.1. For any d \u2265 0, the variety Md is isomorphic with the quotient of\nthe variety Sd by the action of GL(d) under:\ng * (\u03b1, \u03b2, a, b) = (g\u03b1g\u22121 , g\u03b2g\u22121, (g\u22121 )t a, gb),\nfor g \u2208 GL(d), and (\u03b1, \u03b2, a, b) \u2208 Sd .\n10\n\n\fRemark 4.2. The affine variety \u015cd is stable under the above action of GL(d).\nMoreover, the open subset of stable points of \u015cd (under the GL(d)-action) is precisely equal to Sd (cf. [D, Lemma on page 458 and its proof]).\nLemma 4.3. Under the above isomorphism of the variety Md with the quotient of\nSd by GL(d), the action of C\u2217 transports to the action:\nz * (\u03b1, \u03b2, a, b) = (z\u03b1, \u03b2, za, b), for z \u2208 C\u2217 , (\u03b1, \u03b2, a, b) \u2208 Sd .\nProof. The C\u2217 -action on Md via the pull-back corresponds to the bundle:\nKer(z\u22121 \u03bbB\u03bb + \u03bcB\u03bc + \u03bdB\u03bd )\nKer(\u2212\u03bcId\u00d7d \u2212 \u03bd\u03b2, z\u22121\u03bbId\u00d7d + \u03bd\u03b1, \u03bdb)\n=\n\u0001\nIm(z\u22121 \u03bbA\u03bb + \u03bcA\u03bc + \u03bdA\u03bd )\nIm (z\u22121 \u03bbId\u00d7d + \u03bd\u03b1t , \u03bcId\u00d7d + \u03bd\u03b2t , \u03bda)t\nKer(\u2212\u03bcId\u00d7d \u2212 \u03bd\u03b2, z\u22121 \u03bbId\u00d7d + \u03bd\u03b1, \u03bdb)\n=\n\u0001.\nIm (\u03bbId\u00d7d + z\u03bd\u03b1t , z\u03bcId\u00d7d + z\u03bd\u03b2t , z\u03bda)t\n\nChanging the basis in C2d+2 = Cd \u00d7 Cd \u00d7 C2 in the second factor to {ze j }1\u2264 j\u2264d ,\nwhere {e j } is the original basis, we get that the last term in the above equation is\nequal to\nKer(\u2212\u03bcId\u00d7d \u2212 \u03bd\u03b2, \u03bbId\u00d7d + z\u03bd\u03b1, \u03bdb)\n\u0001.\nIm (\u03bbId\u00d7d + z\u03bd\u03b1t , \u03bcId\u00d7d + \u03bd\u03b2t , z\u03bda)t\n\nThis proves the lemma.\n\n\u0003\n\nReferences\n[A] M.F.
