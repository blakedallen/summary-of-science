INTRODUCTION\nThe spin-ordered phase of bcc 3 He presents a difficult challenge to accurate theoretical description.1, 2, 3 The main problem is to explain why the\ntransition temperature4 of 10\u22123 K is two orders of magnitude larger than the\nnuclear dipolar interaction \u223c10\u22125 K. We propose that magnetic ordering is\ndue to correlations in the zero point atomic motion. In this respect it is\nsimilar to the current Multiple-Spin Exchange (MSE) model,3 though the\nzero-point atomic motion in our model however does not involve the exchange of atoms.5 This model has conceptual problems that arise from the\nfact that in order to fit experimental data, many exchange cycles involving a\nlarge number of atoms are needed. In fact, it is not sure that this expansion\nconverges,2, ? i.e. may not be the spin-ordering mechanism. Additionally,\n\n\fN. Gov and E. Polturak\n\nan overall consistent description of the experimental data has still not been\nachieved.1, 6 It is therefore of interest to consider the possibility of another\napproach.\nThe zero-point correlations we consider can be described as zero-point\nelectric dipoles,5 and lower the energy of the ground state.7 This coherent\nstate of oscillating electric dipoles modifies the transverse T1 (110) phonon\nspectrum. We show here that this zero-point motion produces an oscillating\nmagnetic polarization of the electronic cloud which interacts with the nuclear\nspin. This hyper-fine type interaction has the right order of magnitude to\nbe related to the spin-ordering transition, and leads naturally to the distinct\nu2d2 antiferromagnetic phase.\n\n2. COHERENT DIPOLES AND TRANSVERSE PHONONS\nAt temperatures which are high compared to the magnetic interactions\n(T\u226b1mK), the local zero-point motion in bcc 3 He can be treated in the\nsame way as in 4 He.5 We begin by observing5, 9 that the crystal potential is\nhighly anisotropic in the bcc phase, being especially wide and anharmonic\nalong the major axes (100,010,001). This means that the atomic wavefunctions will be particularly extended in these directions, resulting in dynamiccorrelations, to reduce the overlap energy. The current treatment using\nvariational wavefunction9 incorporates these correlations using a Jastrowtype function in a Self-Consistent Harmonic (SCH) calculation. This gives\na satisfactory description of the phonon branches, except for the transeverse\nT1 (110) phonon, which in reality is much softer. Introducing cubic terms\nsoften the phonon spectra, but now ruins the good agreement with the other\nbranches.\nWe would like to describe the softening of this transverse phonon as\nresulting from the hybridization of the (virtual) harmonic phonon with a\n(virtual) local mode.5 The coupling is described as dipolar, where this zeropoint dipole moment arises due to correlated atomic motion in the normal\naxes. The harmonic description of the crystal potential misses the low-lying\nvibration of the atoms due to the shallow (even double-well) potential in\nthe normal directions, which is the one responsible for the dynamic correlations. We therefore treat them as two independent degrees of freedom. In\nthis hybridization procedure we do rely on the SCH calculation, taken from\nprevious works.9\nDirectional oscillation of the nucleus will break the rotational symmetry of the nuclear position relative to the electronic cloud. Going beyond\nthe Born-Oppenheimer approximation, the energy due to relative nuclearelectronic fluctuations is:12 \u2206E \u2243 (m/M )Esp \u2243 10K, where m is the elec-\n\n\fNuclear Spin-Ordering Due to Correlated Atomic Motion in bcc 3 He\n\nFig. 1. The two degenerate 'antiferroelectric' dipole arrangement in the\nground-state of the bcc phase. The arrows show the instantaneous direction\nof the electronic dipoles.\ntron mass, M the nuclear mass, and Esp the excitation energy of the He.\nThis is of the order of the energy involved in the zero-point\nmixing of the s\nq\nand p electronic levels: |\u03c8i \u2243 |si + \u03bb |pi, i.e. \u03bb \u223c \u2206E/Esp \u223c 10\u22122 . Since\nthe nuclear motions are perfectly correlated this polarization results in zeropoint dipolar interactions.5 The dipolar interaction energy E0 , of the order\nof \u2206E, is the energy associated with the zero-point correlated oscillations of\nthe atoms along the major axes.\nThe ground-state of the crystal in which the zero-point motion of the\natoms is correlated may be described as a global state of quantum resonance\nbetween the two degenerate configurations shown in Fig.1, each of which\nminimizes the dipolar interaction energy.5\nDue to the lower symmetry of the dipolar array (Fig.1) compared to\nthe crystal symmetry, a coupling between the harmonic phonons and the\ndipolar modulation exists only along the (110) direction.5 At the edge of\nthe Brillouin zone this transverse phonon has the energy E0 . In addition\nthere appears a localized excitation of energy 2E0 , which is involved in mass\ndiffusion and contributes to the specific-heat,5 i.e. a quantum analogue of\na point defect. There is good agreement of our approach with the experimental data for the T1 (110) spectrum for bcc 4 He.5 This approch has the\nadvantage over current techniques of explicitly describing the main quantum\neffect of the anisotropic and anharmonic potential. It also resolves previous\ninconsistencies relating to the properties of vacancies.\nIn bcc 3 He, sound velocity data indicates that the slope of the T1 (110)\nphonon is about half of the SCH calculation.10, 11 We predict that this ratio\nshould indeed be 0.5, and therefore take half the energy of the calculated11\nSCH T1 (110) phonon at the edge of the Brillouin zone to be the bare dipole-\n\n\fN.

According to our model, the\nenergy of the localized mode involved in thermally activated self-diffusion\nis 2E0 \u2243 10K. This value is in excellent agreement with the activation energy measured by x-ray diffraction, ultrasonics and NMR experiments13 at\nV=21.5cm3 /mole. A similar activation energy is also obtained from the excess specific heat,14 and pressure measurements.15 We therefore establish\nthe likely occurance of coherent zero-point dipoles in the ground-state of bcc\n3 He.\n3. MAGNETIC INTERACTIONS\nWe now describe the magnetic interaction arising from our model. The\nlowest |pi level of the He atom has the electrons in a spin S = 1 state due\nto strong exchange interaction,16 of the order of 0.25eV. In addition this\nlevel is split into 3 sublevels with J = L + S = 0, 1, 2. The splitting, due\nto spin-orbit coupling,16 is of the order of \u223c 1.5K. In the ground state, the\n|pi electrons will reside in the 3 P2 sublevel, with an oscillating magnetic\nmoment Me of size \u223c \u03bbme , where me is the magnetic moment of an electron. Because part of the magnetic moment is now in the |pi state, there\nappears a net uncanceled moment of equal size in the |si component of the\n\n\fNuclear Spin-Ordering Due to Correlated Atomic Motion in bcc 3 He\n\nelectronic wavefunction. In 3 He the nuclear magnetic spin I = 1/2 will interact with the oscillating electronic magnetic moment, mainly due to the\ncontact term of the |si electron at the nucleus. The magnetic interaction is\nof the hyper-fine\ntype,16 and the\nE energy associated with it, Emag , is given\nD\n8\u03c0\nby: Emag = \u2212 3 Me * Mn \u03b4(r) , where Mn is the nuclear magnetic moment\nand the calculation of the matrix element follows.16 We show below that the\nmaximum value of Emag /kB \u2243 0.75mK (for V=24 cm3 /mole), much larger\nthan the direct nuclear dipole-dipole interaction, and is of the right magnitude to explain the high transition temperature of nuclear ordering in bcc\n3 He.\nIn our model, the magnetic energy will change with pressure due to\nchanges of the electronic magnetic polarization Me . The main effect as\nthe solid is compressed, is that the 3 sub-levels (J = 0, 1, 2) broaden into\npartially overlapping bands. The effect of the broadening of the sub-levels\nwith pressure can be approximated using the overlap integral of the three\nsub-levels: hMe (V )i \u2243 (1 \u2212 F (V )) \u03bb(V )me , where the overlap integral F (V )\nis calculated for the spin-orbit levels using a simple band calculation. The\nlevel broadening is the Coulomb energy of the |pi electrons due to overlapping\nwavefunctions on neighboring He nuclei.17\nWe find that the overlap factor 1 \u2212 F (V ) is very sensitive to volume,\nchanging from 1 at V=24 cm3 /mole to \u223c 0.01 at V=19 cm3 /mole. One\ncan see that as the volume decreases the broadening of the bands increase,\nthereby decreasing the net magnetic polarization of the oscillating electronic\ncloud. The strength of the magnetic interaction should be proportional to the\nmeasured Curie-Weiss temperature \u03b8. In Fig.2 we compare the normalized\nmagnetic splitting 2Emag with the normalized values of the measured1 \u03b8.\nWe find that the volume dependence of agrees very well.\nWe now consider the symmetry of the ordered spin system. The existence of the hyper-fine splitting means that the simple quantum resonance\ncondition on each site is broken. Now, the two antiferoelectric configurations\nshown in Fig. 1 are not degenerate, with an energy difference of 2Emag per\nsite. It is possible to restore the degeneracy of the overall ground state, and\nhence the quantum resonance condition. The possible arrangements of the\nnuclear spins that fulfill the resonance requirement on each simple sublattice are those that ensure an equal number of atoms with electronic and\nnuclear spins aligned (and anti-aligned) in both degenerate configurations of\nthe electronic dipoles. These arrangements preserve the overall time-reversal\nsymmetry of the system at zero field. We therefore end up with an u2d2\narrangements which is the symmetry of the ordered nuclear phase.18, 19 We\npoint-out that the u2d2 phase results from symmetry considerations, independent of any quantitative parameters (as in MSE1, 3 ).\n\n\fN. Gov and E. Polturak\n\n4. CONCLUSION\nTo conclude, our model enables us to describe the nuclear magnetic\nordering of bcc 3 He using a single parameter, which is the thermal activation\nenergy E0 . Experimental values of E0 were measured in several experiments.\nThe model describes correctly both the symmetry of the ordered phase and\nthe volume dependence of the magnetic interactions.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work was supported by the Israel Science Foundation, by the Technion VPR fund for the Promotion of Research, the Fulbright Foreign Scholarship grant, the Center for Advanced Studies and NSF grant no.
