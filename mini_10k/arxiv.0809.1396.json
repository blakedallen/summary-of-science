These nebulae are associated with a giant\nmolecular cloud that is one of the closest massive star forming regions to the Sun. This\nchapter reviews the properties of the Mon R2 region, including the namesake reflection\nnebulae, the large scale molecular cloud, global star formation activity, and properties\nof prominent star forming regions in the cloud.\n\n1.\n\nThe Mon R2 Reflection Nebulae\n\nThe Monoceros R2 region is distinguished by a chain of reflection nebulae that extend over 2\u25e6 on the sky. The brightest of these nebulae were studied as far back as\nSeares & Hubble (1920), and were included in a larger study of nebulous objects by\nHubble (1922), who demonstrated that the extended emission can be attributed to the associated stars. The nebulae are included in the Catalog of Bright Diffuse Galactic Nebulae constructed by Cederblad (1946). Various lists of nebulae identified from inspection\nof the Palomar Observatory Sky Survey appear in Dorschner & G\u00fcrtler (1963, 1966),\nvan den Bergh (1966), and Herbst & Racine (1976). Gyulbudaghian, Glushkov, & Denisyuk\n(1978) identified seven additional nebulous objects as candidate Herbig-Haro objects,\nalthough they were later shown to be reflection nebulae (Cohen & Schwartz 1980). The\nnomenclature \"Mon R2\" originated with van den Bergh (1966) to indicate the second\nassociation of reflection nebulae in the constellation Monoceros1 .\nTable 1 lists the nebulous sources in the Mon R2 region identified in the studies\nmentioned above. Coordinates were determined from the digitized Palomar Sky Survey using previously published finding charts (Downes et al. 1975; Herbst & Racine\n1976; Carballo, Eiroa, & Mampaso 1988) and coordinate lists (Rodr\u0131\u0301guez et al. 1980;\nCarballo & Eiroa 1992). Figure 1 marks the location of the nebulae on the blue print\nfrom the Palomar Observatory Sky Survey. The sources GGD 12 through 15 are located\nwithin a small area of the sky and are often collectively referred to as GGD 12-15. The\nmost extensively studied region is the active star forming site embedded in a dense\nmolecular core (identified as the \"core\" in Fig. 1) that lies midway between the reflection nebulae vdB 67 and vdB 69 (see Fig. 2 for a more detailed optical color image of\n\n1\n\nThe Mon R1 reflection nebulae are part of the Mon OB1 association, which includes the Galactic cluster\nNGC 2264.\n\n1\n\n\f2\nTable 1.\n\nOptical Nebulae in the Mon R2 Region\n\nSource\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b4\n\nSpTa\n\nvdB\n\nDG\n\nCed\n\nNGC\n\nB2 V\nA5:\n\n67\n\n88\n\n63\n\n2170\n\nB1 V\nB2 V\nB1 V\n\n69\n68\n70\n\n90\n89\n91\n\n66\n65\n\nB3 V\nB5 V\nB8 V\n\n72\n\n93\n\n68\n\n2182\n\n94\n\n69\n\n2183\n\n95\n96\n\n70\n71\n\n2185\n\n(J2000)\nHR 1\nHR 2\nHR 3\nHR 4\nHR 5a\nHR 5b\nHR 6\nHR 7\nHR 8b\nHR 9b\nHR 10\nHR 11\nHR 12\nHR 13\nHR 14\nHR 15\nHR 16\nHR 17\nHR 18\nHR 19\nHR 20\nHR 21\nHR 22\nHR 23\nHR 24\nHR 25\nHR 26\nHR 27\nHR 28\nHR 29c\nHR 30\nDG 92\nGGD 11\nGGD 12\nGGD 13\nGGD 14\nGGD 15\nGGD 16\nGGD 17\na\n\n6:06:58\n6:07:26\n6:07:30\n6:07:32\n6:07:46\n6:07:46\n6:07:49\n6:07:48\n6:08:05\n6:08:04\n6:08:26\n6:09:15\n6:09:25\n6:09:31\n6:09:45\n6:10:01\n6:10:15\n6:10:37\n6:10:47\n6:10:56\n6:10:57\n6:11:00\n6:11:06\n6:11:49\n6:12:45\n6:12:46\n6:14:46\n6:14:53\n6:15:21\n6:12:50\n6:10:58\n6:08:30\n6:08:33\n6:10:45\n6:10:46\n6:10:50\n6:10:50\n6:12:44\n6:12:50\n\n\u22125:55:10\n\u22126:38:13\n\u22126:29:16\n\u22126:24:03\n\u22126:21:47\n\u22126:23:02\n\u22126:16:35\n\u22126:26:46\n\u22126:21:34\n\u22126:13:38\n\u22125:20:19\n\u22126:30:29\n\u22126:18:35\n\u22126:19:36\n\u22126:18:35\n\u22126:18:42\n\u22126:27:32\n\u22126:09:58\n\u22126:12:41\n\u22126:14:22\n\u22126:16:21\n\u22126:14:36\n\u22126:12:33\n\u22126:09:22\n\u22126:12:31\n\u22126:10:49\n\u22126:20:36\n\u22126:22:44\n\u22126:25:50\n\u22126:13:11\n\u22126:14:39\n\u22126:30:30\n\u22126:18:16\n\u22126:12:45\n\u22126:13:04\n\u22126:12:01\n\u22126:11:15\n\u22126:15:24\n\u22126:12:57\n\nA0:\n\nB8-A0\nB4 V\n\nB7 V\nB5 V\nK4\nBe\n\n74\n\n97\n98\n92\n\nSpectral types from Herbst & Racine (1976) and Carballo & Eiroa (1992).\nHerbst & Racine (1976) associated HR 8 with vdB 69 and HR 9 with vdB 68.\nThese designations are inconsistent with the coordinates of these sources and the\nfinding chart in that paper (cf.

North is to the upper right, and east is\nto the upper left. Photograph courtesy of R. Croman.\n\nthis region). In many contexts, the name \"Mon R2\" refers to this particular star forming\nregion.\nRacine (1968, see also Herbst & Racine 1976) conducted the first detailed spectroscopic and photometric study of the Mon R2 nebulae and found that the illuminating\nstars have mainly B spectral types, where B1 V is the earliest type star in the association.\nHerbst & Racine (1976) estimated an age of 6 to 10 Myr for the association. The lower\nlimit is ascertained since the color-magnitude diagram for the Mon R2 stellar population\ndoes not deviate from the zero-age main-sequence for stars with (B \u2212 V )0 \u2264 0.05 mag,\nwhile a pre-main-sequence population is observed for such stars in other clusters such\nas the Orion Nebula Cluster and NGC 2264. The upper age limit was inferred since the\nB1 stars in the association still lie on the main-sequence. As noted by Herbst & Racine\n(1976), the young age for the association suggests that the B-stars likely formed within\nthe cloud, and the reflection nebulae are not the result of a chance encounter of B-stars\nwith a gas-cloud (c.f. the Pleiades; White 2003).\nRacine (1968) estimated a distance of 830\u00b150 pc to Mon R2 using spectroscopy\nand/or U BV photometry for 10 stars in the reflection nebulae. Using similar techniques, Rojkovskij & Kurchakov (1968, as reported in Downes et al. 1975) derived a\ndistance of 700 pc. Racine & van den Bergh (1970) revised the distance from Racine\n\n\f5\n(1968) to 950 pc, but did not provide further details on the factors leading to the new estimate. Herbst & Racine (1976) fitted the zero-age-main-sequence locus from Johnson\n(1963) to dereddened U BV photometry and also obtained a distance of 830\u00b150 pc,\nwhich is the distance typically adopted for the Mon R2 association.\n\n2.\n\nThe Mon R2 Molecular Cloud\n\nIn addition to bright reflection nebulae, the Mon R2 region is readily identified on\noptical photographs as an opaque region in silhouette against the backdrop of field stars\n(see Fig 2). Lynds (1962) identified 4 prominent \"dark nebulae\" (L1643, 1644, 1645,\nand 1646) that form the main part of the molecular cloud that is associated with the\nreflection nebulae. An extinction map of the Mon R2 region derived from optical star\ncounts by Dobashi et al. (2005) is presented in Figure 3 that clearly delineates the\nMon R2 region (labeled TGU 1493 in this map) and dark clouds in its vicinity.\n\nFigure 3.\nExtinction map in Galactic coordinates of the Mon R2 cloud and vicinity as derived from star counts in the Digital Sky Survey I database (Dobashi et al.\n2005). The lowest contour indicates the AV = 0.5 mag boundary. Symbols\nindicate identified clouds (filled circles) and clumps within clouds (plus signs).\nThe Mon R2 cloud is object TGU 1493 in the Dobashi et al. (2005) catalog at\n(l, b \u2248 214.3\u25e6, \u221212.9\u25e6), and includes Lynds (1962) dark nebulae L1643, 1644,\n1645, and 1646. The main star forming core is near clump P2, and the GGD 1215 region is near P8.\n\n\f6\n\nFigure 4.\nOverview of the molecular clouds in the vicinity of Mon R2 from\nMaddalena et al. (1986).

(1986).\n\n2.1.\n\nGlobal Characteristics\n\nThe Mon R2 region received renewed interest with the first observations of carbon\nmonoxide in the interstellar medium and the discovery of molecular clouds (Wilson, Jefferts, & Penzias\n1970). Loren, Peters, & vanden Bout (1974) reported the first 12 CO (J=1-0) detection\nin Mon R2, and Kutner & Tucker (1975) showed that at least five of the reflection nebulae are associated with local maxima in 12 CO maps. A number of maps have subse-\n\n\f7\n\nFigure 5.\nMolecular line maps of the peak 12 CO J=1-0 antenna temperature\n(bottom panel; Xie 1992) and the 13 CO J=1-0 integrated intensity (top panel;\nMiesch, Scalo, & Bally 1999). Darker gray scales corresponds to regions of brighter\nemission.\n\n\f8\nquently been made, with ever improving resolution and coverage, and increasing number of molecular species (Loren 1977; Maddalena et al. 1986; Montalb\u00e1n et al. 1990;\nXie & Goldsmith 1994; Miesch, Scalo, & Bally 1999; Kim et al. 2004; Wilson et al.\n2005). A large-scale view of the molecular clouds in Orion and Monoceros as traced\nby carbon monoxide is shown in Figure 4 (Maddalena et al. 1986). The Mon R2 cloud\nextends over a \u223c 3\u25e6 \u00d7 6\u25e6 (44 pc \u00d7 88 pc) region roughly parallel to the Galactic plane,\nbut offset from the plane by \u223c \u201312\u25e6 . Mon R2 is located in projection near the Orion\nsystem of molecular clouds, although Orion is a factor of two closer in distance. Heiles\n(1998) has suggested that the two regions may nonetheless be linked by an expanding\nsuperbubble (GSH 238+00+09) that triggered star formation in these regions.\nFigure 5 presents images of the J=1\u20130 emission from 12 CO (Xie & Goldsmith\n1994) and 13 CO (Bally, Langer, & Liu 1991; Miesch, Scalo, & Bally 1999). The 12 CO\nmap, tracing approximately the kinetic temperature, shows a bright peak near the Mon R2\ncore and a sharp filament of gas extending in nearly a north-south direction. The 13 CO\nimage traces the molecular column density and shows several peaks in the molecular\nemission that correspond to the location of reflection nebulae. Xie & Goldsmith (1994)\nanalyzed the global velocity field in the Mon R2 cloud as traced by 12 CO and suggested the cloud is an expanding shell of molecular gas with a dynamical time scale\nof \u223c 4 Myr. No clear energy source driving the expansion was identified, although the\ncenter of the shell is near the NGC 2182 reflection nebula. Xie (1992) estimated a cloud\nmass of 4 \u00d7 104 M\u2299 for the region shown in Figure 5 that has been observed in both\n12 CO and 13 CO using traditional LTE analysis (Dickman 1978).

(1986) encompass the entire cloud, and they estimated a higher mass\nof 9 \u00d7 104 M\u2299 by adopting a constant conversion factor from 12 CO J=1-0 integrated\nintensity to H2 column density (see, e.g., Strong et al. 1988).\n\n2.2.\n\nStellar Content\n\nThe global star formation activity in the Mon R2 molecular cloud has been explored at\nmultiple wavelengths, including (1) ROSAT X-ray pointed observations to search for\nyoung stars, (2) 2MASS near-infrared and Spitzer mid-infrared observations to identify stellar clusters, (3) IRAS far-infrared images to probe for embedded star forming\nregions, (4) radio continuum surveys to identify embedded massive stars, and (5) H2\nimaging surveys to trace jets originating from young stars. The stellar content traced by\nthese diagnostics paint a consistent picture where the Mon R2 and GGD 12-15 region\nare the two most active star forming sites in the Mon R2 molecular cloud. We now\nsummarize the results from many of these observations.\nThe lower mass stellar content in the Mon R2 cloud has been investigated by\nCarpenter (2000), who used the 2MASS point source catalog to identify compact stellar\nclusters and quantify any stellar population distributed more uniformly over the cloud.\nFour clusters were found based on enhancements in the stellar surface density relative\nto the field star population as shown in Figure 6. These four clusters, listed in Table 2,\nare associated with the Mon R2 core (containing 371 stars brighter than Ks =14.3 after\nsubtracting the expected field star population), GGD 12-15 (134 stars), GGD 17 (23\nstars), and IRAS 06046-0603 (15 stars). Carpenter (2000) also assessed the magnitude\nof any distributed stellar population by measuring the surface density of stars toward the\nmolecular cloud relative to the field star surface density. The number of stars contained\nin the distributed population is between 190 and 790 stars. These results suggest that an\n\n\f9\n\nFigure 6.\nUpper left: Ks -band stellar surface density map of the Mon R2 molecular cloud for stars with magnitudes of 6.0 mag \u2264 m(Ks ) \u2264 14.3 mag.

(1998) used ROSAT to conduct an X-ray survey over a 2\u25e6\ndiameter region centered on the Mon R2 cloud. The highest resolution and sensitivity\nwas achieved for the inner \u223c 35\u2032 . They detected 41 point sources with a signal to\nnoise ratio greater than 2.5, and possibly seven additional detections at lower confidence\nlevels. The spatial distribution of the 41 X-ray sources are indicated in Figure 7. Based\non the observed X-ray hardness ratios and the ratio of the X-ray to stellar bolometric\nluminosity, Gregorio-Hetem et al. (1998) suggest that most of the detected sources are\nanalogous to Herbig Ae/Be stars and the more X-ray active T Tauri stars. Extended Xray emission was detected as well, which may originate from partially resolved X-ray\nemitting young stars within the Mon R2 cloud.\nIRAS provided a sensitive survey of the embedded stellar content over the entire\nMon R2 molecular cloud. Xie (1992) selected a sample of 36 IRAS point sources having photometric properties consistent with star forming regions (see Beichman et al.\n1986) in that (1) the sources are detected at 25 \u03bcm or both 60 \u03bcm and 100 \u03bcm,\nand (2) S\u03bd (25 \u03bcm) \u2265 S\u03bd (12 \u03bcm). Table 3 lists the 36 IRAS sources meeting these\ncriteria.

For\nsources where an upper limit to the flux density is listed in the IRAS catalog for one or\nmore bands, column 9 lists the upper limit to the luminosity. The luminosities range\nfrom 1.5 L\u2299 to 26,000 L\u2299 . The two most luminous IRAS sources are associated with the\nMon R2 core (LIR \u223c 26,000 L\u2299 ) and GGD 12-15 (5700 L\u2299 ). Most of the remaining\nIRAS sources have luminosities less than 1000 L\u2299 . Figure 7 shows the location of the\nIRAS sources overlaid on a 12 CO image, where the diameter of the circle is proportional\nto the far-infrared luminosity. The IRAS sources are spatially distributed in two groups.\nOne group extends east-west along the chain of reflection nebulae. The second group\nextends north-south along the sharp boundary of the cloud traced by 12 CO emission.\nHughes & Baines (1985) traced the massive embedded stellar content in the\nMon R2 molecular cloud by surveying a 16 deg2 region in the radio continuum at\n3.2 GHz and 10.55 GHz with angular resolution of 8\u2032 .3 and 2\u2032 .8, respectively. The sensitivity limit of the survey was 40 mJy at both frequencies, sufficient to detect an H II\nregion excited by a B1 star. Three radio continuum sources with a thermal spectrum\nwere detected. The survey also detected 10 additional radio continuum sources with\na non-thermal spectrum that were presumed extragalactic in origin. An additional ten\n\n\f11\n\nFigure 7.\nSpatial distribution of various tracers of star formation activity overlaid on an image of the peak 12 CO intensity (Xie 1992). The H II regions are from\nHughes & Baines (1985), the ROSAT sources from Gregorio-Hetem et al. (1998),\nand the optical nebulae from Table 1. Open circles represent the IRAS point sources\nlisted in Table 3, where the size of the circle is proportional to the infrared luminosity (LIR ). The dashed circles show the full field of view of the ROSAT pointed\nobservations (outer circle), and the 35\u2032 diameter region that was imaged with high\nsensitivity and resolution (inner circle).\n\nsources were detected in only one frequency, and are most likely extragalactic based on\nthe expected radio continuum source counts.\nTable 4 lists the positions and flux densities of the three H II regions detected by\nHughes & Baines (1985). The location of the H II regions are shown as open triangles\nin Figure 7. One of the radio continuum sources is located in the Mon R2 core, and\na second in the GGD 12-15 region. The third radio continuum source, which has not\nbeen well studied, is situated in a hole in the 12 CO emission (see Fig. 7) and has no\nclear correspondence with a reflection nebula or IRAS source. Assuming that the radio\ncontinuum emission is optically thin and the ionization flux is produced by a single\nstar at the distance of Mon R2, the spectral type of the ionizing star for all three radio\ncontinuum sources is an early B-type star as listed in Table 4.\nDownes et al. (1975) showed that the radio continuum emission in the Mon R2\ncore extends over a 2\u2032 diameter region, but most of the emission originates from a\ncompact H II region.

(1997) to map the projected magnetic\nfield direction in the Mon R2 molecular cloud. The R-band measurements over a 9\u2032\nfield by Zartisky et al. (1987) show a projected magnetic field orientation of P.A. =\n167\u25e6 , parallel to the local Galactic magnetic field, and also parallel to the direction of\nthe Mon R2 molecular outflow (Bally & Lada 1983). The studies by Hodapp (1987)\nbased on I- and K-band polarization vectors, and by Yao et al. (1997) based on Ks band data, concentrated on the region near the cloud core. Both suggested that the projected magnetic field appears to have an hourglass shape, indicative of the collapse of a\nsupercritical cloud where the frozen-in magnetic field lines are bent toward the cloud's\ncenter by the gravitational field of the cloud core. The conclusion that the magnetic field\nin Mon R2 is bent was confirmed by sub-millimeter (800 \u03bcm) emission polarimetry by\nGreaves, Holland, & Murray (1995) and far-infrared (100 \u03bcm) data from Novak et al.\n(1989).\nA study of the polarization pattern in the R-band over a much wider field using\nthree 23\u2032 \u00d7 23\u2032 CCD images by Jarrett et al. (1994, see Fig. 8) images confirmed many\nof the earlier results and demonstrated the continuity between the magnetic field orientation measured in the tenuous parts of the cloud (by R-band polarimetry) and the\ndense parts (measured by I-band and K-band polarimetry). However, they also showed\na second pattern of polarization vectors east of the molecular core that cannot be explained simply by the gravitational pull of the molecular core. Instead, their results\nare best interpreted in a scenario where a large-scale expanding shell has distorted the\nmagnetic field lines extending from the core to the north.\n3.\n\nIndividual Regions\n\nIn this section we review the properties of individual star forming regions in the Mon R2\nmolecular cloud, including the main Mon R2 core (see Sect. 3.1.), the small group of\nnebulae in GGD 12-15 (Sect. 3.2.), and the star forming sites associated with HH 866\n(Sect. 3.3.) and GGD 16-17 (Sect. 3.4.).\n3.1.\n\nThe Mon R2 Cluster\n\nThe Mon R2 core is distinguished by a stellar cluster (see Fig. 9), one of the largest\n(6.6 pc) and most powerful known molecular outflows (Bally & Lada 1983; Wolf, Lada, & Bally\n\n\f14\n\nFigure 8.\nR-band image of the Mon R2 core region overlaid with R-band\npolarization vectors (Jarrett et al. 1994). The circle represents the area where\nJarrett et al. (1994) did not obtain polarization data. In the inner 3\u2032 the I- and Kband point source measurements from Hodapp (1987) were added. Note that Fig. 12\nfrom Hodapp (1987) shows mostly the polarization vectors of scattered light in the\nreflection nebula; those polarization vectors are not included here, since they do not\ntrace the magnetic field orientation. The long lines intersecting the circle represent\nthe long-axis of the molecular outflow from the core region (Bally & Lada 1983).\n\n1990; Meyers-Rice & Lada 1991; Xie, Goldsmith, & Patel 1993; Tafalla, Bachiller, & Wright\n1994), a compact H II region (Downes et al. 1975; Massi, Felli, & Simon 1985), H2 O\nand OH masers (Downes et al. 1975; Knapp & Brown 1976), and X-ray emission\n(Hamaguchi, Tsuboi, & Koyama 2000; Kohno, Koyama, & Hamaguchi 2002; Nakajima et al.\n2003).\nMolecular line (Tafalla et al. 1997; Choi et al. 2000) and submillimeter continuum (Walker, Adams, & Lada 1990; Henning, Chini, & Pfau 1992; Giannakopoulou et al.\n1997) observations have shown that the cluster is embedded in a dense core which has\na diameter of \u223c 3\u2032 (0.7 pc). The core displays a rich chemical structure that is driven\nby the high ultraviolet flux from the embedded B-star (Rizzo, Fuente, & Garc\u0131\u0301a-Burillo\n\n\f15\n\nFigure 9.\nThree-color composite (blue \u2013 J; green \u2013 H; red \u2013 K) of the Mon R2\ncluster (Carpenter et al. 1997).

The reflection nebulae vdB 69 and vdB 67 are located to\nthe left and right, respectively, of the central Mon R2 cluster. This infrared image\ncan be compared with the optical image presented in Fig. 2.\n\n2005). The core mass derived from multi-transition CS molecular line observations is\n\u223c 760 M\u2299 , of which 130 M\u2299 is being accelerated by an outflow (Tafalla et al. 1997,\nwhere masses and sizes are scaled to a distance of 830 pc). Walker, Adams, & Lada\n(1990) and Henning, Chini, & Pfau (1992) estimate a core mass of \u223c 200 M\u2299 within\nthe central 2.7 arcmin2 based on millimeter continuum observations.\nBeckwith et al. (1976) discovered the embedded cluster in the Mon R2 core\nthrough H, K, 10 \u03bcm, and 20 \u03bcm scan-maps. Five discrete sources (IRS 1-5) were detected at 10 \u03bcm, with two additional sources (IRS 6 and IRS 7) appearing at H- and Kband only. Figure 10 identifies these sources on modern images of the cluster. IRS 1 has\nbeen resolved into two components (Aspin & Walther 1990; Howard, Pipher, & Forrest\n1994), but the fainter of the two components in the mid-infrared (IRS 1NE) is a foreground field star. IRS 3 appeared extended in the Beckwith et al.

(1993) showed that the\nbright southern source in IRS 3 is surrounded by a bright conical nebula, which they\nsuggest is produced by starlight scattered from a circumstellar disk. Preibisch et al.\n(2002) resolved the IRS 3 region into 6 discrete sources. Speckle images from their\nstudy are presented in Figure 11. In addition to the conical nebula around IRS 3A,\nthese images reveal three knots of emission distributed along a line connecting to\nIRS 3B. Preibisch et al. (2002) suggest these knots are related to a jet originating from\nIRS 3B. The orientation of the possible jet is roughly perpendicular to the large scale\nmolecular outflow originating from the Mon R2 core (Wolf, Lada, & Bally 1990), but it\nmay be related to a second outflow that is inferred from analysis of the gas kinematics\n(Meyers-Rice & Lada 1991). Infrared spectra of IRS 3 at 3.3 and 11.2 \u03bcm reveal absorption features attributed to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (Sellgren et al. 1995;\nBregman, Hayward, & Sloan 2000).\nThe Beckwith et al. (1976) maps revealed a ringlike nebula surrounding the infrared point source IRS 2 and also including the source IRS 1 (see Fig. 10). Linear polarization measurements in the K-band by Hodapp (1987, see Fig. 12) using a\nsingle-beam infrared polarimeter demonstrated that this nebulosity exhibits strong polarization in a centro-symmetric pattern centered on IRS 2, identifying it as a reflection\nnebula illuminated by IRS 2. Aspin & Walther (1990) confirmed these results using\ninfrared imaging polarimetry with higher spatial resolution. In addition to the scattered\ncomponent, they also identified a polarization component caused by aligned grains that\nexplains the polarization of IRS 2 itself and of the faint extended flux in the reflection\nnebula close to the line of sight towards IRS 2. Additional near-infrared imaging polarimetry was reported by Yao et al. (1997), who, in addition to confirming the earlier\n\n\f17\n\nFigure 11.\nH- and K-band images of IRS 3 from speckle interferometry. For\nall images, north is up and east is to the left. Upper left: Color representation of\nthe H-band image. Upper right: Color representation of the K-band image. Lower\nleft: Color composite of the H- and K-band images. Lower right: K-band image\nmarked with six point sources and a possible jet originating from IRS 3B. Figure\nfrom Preibisch et al. (2002).\n\nresults on the illumination by IRS 2, also discuss in detail the scattered light polarization pattern around IRS 3, the brightest of the near-infrared sources. Their measurements show IRS 3 to have the polarization pattern of an object with a multi-scattering\ndisk oriented in SE-NW orientation, and larger degrees of polarization caused by single\nscattering in the direction perpendicular to the disk, consistent with the details of the\nspatial structure of IRS 3 revealed by Preibisch et al. (2002).\nThe 10 \u03bcm and 20 \u03bcm maps of Hackwell, Grasdalen, & Gehrz (1982) show that,\nwhile IRS 2 is the brightest source in the area of the reflection nebula at a wavelength of\n10 \u03bcm, IRS 1 is, by far, the dominant source at 20 \u03bcm, and appears extended. The VLA\n\n\f18\n\nFigure 12.\nK-band image of the Mon R2 star forming core superposed with polarization vectors measured in K-band with 8.4\u2032\u2032 resolution (Hodapp 1987). The\npolarization vectors reveal that the extended emission at 2.2 \u03bcm is a shell-like reflection nebula illuminated by IRS 2.\n\nobservations by Massi, Felli, & Simon (1985) revealed a region of radio-continuum\nemission coinciding with the near-infrared reflection nebula, but with a sharp concentration of the radio flux near the southeastern edge of the region, in the general area of\nIRS 1.\nFar-infrared (Thronson et al. 1978, 1980) and submillimeter (Henning, Chini, & Pfau\n1992) observations have identified IRS 1, IRS 2 and IRS 3 as the most luminous sources\nin the cluster. From radiative transfer models, Henning, Chini, & Pfau (1992) estimate\nthe luminosities of these three components to be 3000 L\u2299 , 6500 L\u2299 , and 14,000 L\u2299\nrespectively. IRS 1 is considered the ionizing source of the radio continuum emission;\nthe K-band position of IRS 1 is offset by \u223c 4\u2032\u2032 from the peak radio continuum position, which can be explained in the blister H II region model (Massi, Felli, & Simon\n1985). The inferred spectral type of IRS 1 based on the radio continuum emission is B0\nZAMS, which is broadly consistent with the infrared luminosity. Tafalla et al. (1997)\ndid not detect radio continuum emission toward IRS 3 even though it is the most lu-\n\n\f19\nminous source, and they suggested IRS 3 is in a younger stage of evolution relative to\nIRS 1.\nNear-infrared images with array detectors have identified a cluster of a few hundred stars in the Mon R2 core (Aspin & Walther 1990; Howard, Pipher, & Forrest 1994;\nHodapp 1994; Carpenter et al. 1997). Figure 9 presents a 3-color composite image\nof a 15\u2032 \u00d7 15\u2032 region centered on the cluster from Carpenter et al. (1997). Analysis\nof the star counts in this image indicates that the cluster extends over a 4.5\u2032 \u00d7 8.5\u2032\n(2.1 pc\u00d72.1 pc) region elongated in a north-south direction. Many of the cluster members have been detected in X-rays with deep Chandra observations (Kohno, Koyama, & Hamaguchi\n2002; Nakajima et al. 2003).\n\nFigure 13.\nImages of Mon R2 overlaid with the distribution of YSOs identified\nand classified on the basis on H, K and Spitzer 3.6 and 4.5 \u03bcm photometry.

The\nbottom right shows the distribution of Class I and II source color coded in red and\nblue, with 13 CO contours overlaid. Figure from Gutermuth (2005).\n\n\f20\nBased on analysis of the near-infrared photometric data, Carpenter et al. (1997)\nfound that the stellar mass function in the Mon R2 cluster is consistent with the MillerScalo mass function for stellar masses \u2265 0.1 M\u2299 . No compelling evidence for mass\nsegregation was found within the cluster for stellar masses <\n\u223c 2 M\u2299 , but as has been\nnoted in NGC 2024 and the Orion Nebula Cluster, the most massive stars are situated\nnear the cluster center (see Carpenter et al. 1997, and references therein). Andersen et al.\n(2006) used HST NICMOS observations to extend the mass function to 20 MJup by\ncomputing the ratio of the number of low mass stars between 0.08 and 1 M\u2299 to the\nnumber of brown dwarfs between 0.02 and 0.08 M\u2299 . Their results show that this ratio\nis similar to that inferred in Taurus, IC 348, the Orion Nebula Cluster, and the system\nfield IMF (Chabrier 2003).\nRecently, Gutermuth (2005) studied the distribution of YSOs of different evolutionary states in a number of embedded young clusters, including Mon R2. Figure 13\nsummarizes these results and compares the YSO spatial distribution to the distribution\nof 13 CO emission. These results demonstrate that the youngest (Class I) YSOs are distributed in a non-symmetric distribution that strongly resembles the distribution of the\ngas. In contrast, the presumed older Class II sources appear more widely distributed.\nAn imaging survey in the 2.12 \u03bcm emission line of H2 1\u20130 S(1) by Hodapp (2007)\nled to the discovery of 15 new H2 jets in Mon R2 that represent the very youngest\nobjects in their main accretion phase (Class 0 and I). The newly discovered H2 jets\nare overlaid on Figure 14 as open circles with labels. Also overlaid are the lowest\ncontours of the blue and redshifted features in the CO map of Wolf, Lada, & Bally\n(1990), showing the outline of the huge outflow that dominates the Mon R2 cloud. This\noutflow is one of the most massive CO outflows known and has carved out a large cavity\nin the core of the Mon R2 molecular cloud. Only two of the newly found H2 jets are\nlying clearly outside of the CO outflow contours. The longest of the newly discovered\nH2 jets (HOD07-13) lies just south of the redshifted CO lobe. It is shown at 2.12 \u03bcm\nand 3.6 \u03bcm (Spitzer/IRAC) wavelengths in Figure 15. While the Spitzer 4.5 \u03bcm band\ngenerally shows H2 shock-excited emission better than the 3.6 \u03bcm band, those longer\nwavelength data were not available when this figure was prepared.\nThe CO outflows probably have a shell structure with a relatively empty cavity\nnear the outflow axis (Meyers-Rice & Lada 1991). Since the outflowing material interacts turbulently with the molecular material of the ambient cloud, triggered star formation would be expected near the interface between the shell and the ambient cloud. The\nsurface density of triggered star formation sites is expected to be higher in projection\nalong the shell wall compared to the front and back sides of the outflow shell. The overall distribution of newly found H2 jets outside of the central cluster roughly matches\nthis expectation.\nHodapp (2007) also found that the area near the Mon R2 cluster contains numerous\nsmall patches of nebulosity, often with bipolar or cometary morphology, that did not fit\nthe adopted criteria for identification as shocks or jets. These are indicated by small\nsquare symbols in Fig. 14. The bipolar or cometary shape of many of these objects\nsuggests that these are young, embedded stars still surrounded by disks and that they\nhave just excavated an outflow cavity in the surrounding molecular material that is now\nobserved via scattered light. These objects appear particularly numerous in the area\nabout 2 to 3 arcminutes south of the main Mon R2 cluster, and just north of the cluster.\nThis finding is consistent with the result by Gutermuth (2005) that the Class I sources\nin Mon R2, identified by their J, H, and K, and Spitzer IRAC colors, are concentrated\n\n\f21\n\nFigure 14.\nImage of the Mon R2 star forming region in the 1\u20130 S(1) emission\nline of H2 at 2.12 \u03bcm, obtained with WFCAM at UKIRT. The circles indicate the\npositions of the newly found H2 jets. The Herbig-Haro object HH 866 is visible\nin the north-west corner of the image. The small reflection nebula near the eastern\nedge of the image is GGD 11 (Gyulbudaghian, Glushkov, & Denisyuk 1978). Newly\nfound small reflection nebulae are indicated by squares. Superposed on this image\nare lowest contours of the blueshifted (\u20132 to 6 km s\u22121 , solid line) and redshifted\n(14 to 22 km s\u22121 , dashed line) CO emission from the map by Wolf, Lada, & Bally\n(1990).\n\n\f22\n\nFigure 15.\nThe largest of the 15 H2 jets recently found by Hodapp (2007) in a\n2.12 \u03bcm survey of the Mon R2 region. The left panel shows the jet HOD07-13 in\nthe H2 1\u20130 S(1) line, and the right panel shows the Spitzer/IRAC 3.6 \u03bcm image.\n\n\f23\nin a filamentary distribution to the south of the cluster center, and to the north and northeast of the cluster. While there is no strict relationship between reflection nebulae of\nbipolar or cometary morphology and SED Class I, the two criteria cover objects of\nsimilar evolutionary status at the end of their accretion phase.\nTo the east of the Mon R2 cluster, the isolated object GGD 11 has the morphology of a bipolar reflection nebula, indicating a recently formed young star in relative\nisolation from the cluster (see Fig. 16).\n\nFigure 16.\nImage at 2.12 \u03bcm of the bipolar reflection nebula GGD 11 from\nHodapp (2007).\n\n3.2.\n\nGGD 12-15\n\nThe dense core associated with GGD 12-15 possesses similar properties as the main\ncore in the Mon R2 cloud. The core extends over a \u223c 0.7 pc region as traced by HCO+\nand 13 CO J=1-0 with a mass of \u223c 600-800 M\u2299 (Heaton et al. 1988). Submillimeter\ncontinuum observations have detected a compact clump (size \u223c 0.15 pc) in the center\nof the core with a mass of \u223c 280 M\u2299 (Little, Heaton, & Dent 1990). Rodr\u0131\u0301guez et al.\n(1982) detected blue and red shifted CO emission from the core indicative of high\nvelocity gas in a molecular outflow.\nThe embedded cluster in the GGD 12-15 region began to be uncovered first by\nCohen & Schwartz (1980), and, soon after, by Reipurth & Wamsteker (1983) who found\na group of seven sources (see also Olofsson & Koornneef 1985). More recent results\nsuggest the cluster population is as high as \u223c 130 stars (Hodapp 1994; Carpenter 2000).\nFigure 17 presents an optical and 2MASS Ks -band image of the GGD 12-15 region.\nThe various optical nebulae are identified, as well as the position of a compact H II region (cross; Rodr\u0131\u0301guez et al. 1980; Kurtz, Churchwell, & Wood 1994; Tofani et al.\n1995; G\u00f3mez et al. 1998) and a water maser (open circle; Rodr\u0131\u0301guez et al. 1980;\nTofani et al. 1995). Recently, Gutermuth (2005) studied the distribution of YSOs\nof different evolutionary state in GGD 12-15. Figure 18 summarizes the results and\ndemonstrates that the youngest (Class I) YSOs are distributed in a non-symmetric pattern that still strongly resembles the distribution of gas and dust. In contrast, the presumed older Class II sources are distributed more widely.\n\n\f24\n\nFigure 17.\nImages of the GGD 12-15 region. The left panel shows the red print\nfrom the Palomar Observatory Sky Survey, and the right panel is the 2MASS Ks band image. The optical nebulae in the GGD 12-15 regions are indicated on the\nPalomar image, where \"HR\" refers to the nebulae listed in Herbst & Racine (1976),\nand \"GGD\" to Gyulbudaghian, Glushkov, & Denisyuk (1978, see also Rodriguez et\nal. 1980). In both panels, the cross and the open circle indicate the position of a H II\nregion and water maser respectively.\n\nThe compact H II region in GGD 12-15 is coincident with mid- to far-infrared and\nsubmillimeter emission (Harvey et al. 1985; Little, Heaton, & Dent 1990; Persi & Tapia\n2003). The implied bolometric luminosity is <6600 L\u2299 for a distance of 830 pc, where\nthe upper limit is implied since multiple sources contribute to the flux within the IRAS\nbeam (Harvey et al. 1985; Persi & Tapia 2003). The inferred spectral type of the ionizing star from the radio continuum flux is B0.5, which is sufficient to produce most\nof the observed far-infrared luminosity. The water maser in GGD 12-15 is offset from\nthe compact H II region and is coincident with a compact 20\u03bcm source (Harvey et al.\n1985). The embedded star associated with the maser is centered between red- and blueshifted molecular outflow (Rodr\u0131\u0301guez et al. 1982; Little, Heaton, & Dent 1990) lobes\nand is the likely source of the outflow (Harvey et al. 1985).\nG\u00f3mez, Rodr\u0131\u0301guez, & Garay (2000) report sensitive VLA radio continuum observations of the GGD 12-15 region and detected five new radio continuum sources in\naddition to the luminous compact H II region detected in previous surveys. They originally suggested these fainter sources are ultracompact H II regions around B2-B3 stars.\nMore sensitive follow-up VLA observations raised the total to ten radio continuum\nsources in the GGD 14 core (G\u00f3mez, Rodr\u0131\u0301guez, & Garay 2002, see Fig 19). These additional observations showed, however, that several of these sources are time variable,\nand have negative spectral indices, which led G\u00f3mez, Rodr\u0131\u0301guez, & Garay (2002) to\nconclude that the radio emission from the fainter sources most likely originates from gyrosynchrotron radiation from an active magnetosphere. The two exceptions are VLA 7,\nwhich is possibly a radio jet as implied by the spectral slope of the radio continuum\nemission (G\u00f3mez, Rodr\u0131\u0301guez, & Garay 2002), and VLA 4, which has a 1-20 \u03bcm luminosity of \u223c 240 L\u2299 and may be B-type star (Persi & Tapia 2003).\n\n\f25\n\nFigure 18.\nImages of GGD 12-15 overlaid with the distribution of YSOs identified and classified on the basis of H, K and Spitzer 3.6 and 4.5 \u03bcm photometry.\nThe upper left is a JHK false color image with Class II sources marked by green\ndiamonds.

The region was identified by Carpenter\n(2000) as a region of enhanced star density in 2MASS data, and was identified as a\npotential CO outflow source by Xu et al. (2001). Images at 2.12 \u03bcm (Hodapp 2007)\nshows a system of emission features that can be morphologically identified as two H2\njets, partly associated with the optical HH objects.\n\n\f26\n\nFigure 19.\nContour map of the 2MASS Ks -band image of the GGD 14 star\nforming region. Crosses mark the position of VLA radio continuum sources from\nG\u00f3mez, Rodr\u0131\u0301guez, & Garay (2002). VLA 1 is a bright cometary H II region excited\nby an early B-star. Figure from G\u00f3mez, Rodr\u0131\u0301guez, & Garay (2002).\n\n3.4.\n\nGGD 16-17\n\nA smaller site of ongoing star formation in the Mon R2 molecular cloud are the objects\nassociated with GGD 16 and 17 (Gyulbudaghian, Glushkov, & Denisyuk 1978). To the\nsouth of GGD 17, the T Tauri star Bretz 4 is probably associated with the GGD object.\nThis star has been studied spectroscopically by Herbig & Rao (1972) and was classified by Carballo & Eiroa (1992) as a K4 spectral type with a class 5 (Herbig 1962)\nemission spectrum. The embedded objects associated with GGD 16 and 17 were first\nstudied by Reipurth & Wamsteker (1983) and confirmed by Carballo, Eiroa, & Mampaso\n(1988). The infrared source IRS 2 is positionally coincident with Bretz 4, while the\nmore deeply embedded IRS 1 has no optical counterpart and lies between the GGD\nobjects. A detailed optical study by Carballo & Eiroa (1992) showed that GGD 17\nis part of a curved jet extending north of the star Bretz 4 and consisting of HH 271\n(also known as GGD 17 HH1) and HH 272 (GGD 17 HH2), and possibly also HH 273\n(GGD 17 HH3). Nebulosity close to the star shows the typical morphology of scattered\nlight from an outflow cavity wall. The embedded infrared objects and optical reflection nebulosity in the general GGD 16-17 region is associated with 850 \u03bcm emission\n(Jenness, Scott, & Padman 1995). Beltr\u00e1n et al. (2001) present VLA 6 cm radio continuum images of the GGD 16-17 region. Their radio continuum map, reproduced in\nFigure 20, shows the locations of the radio sources with respect to a water maser, an\nIRAS source, and HH 271.\n\n\f27\n\nFigure 20.\nVLA 6 cm contour map of the GGD 16-17 region (also known as\nMon R2E).
