These three-braids\ncan then be efficiently compiled and improved to any required accuracy using the Solovay-Kitaev\nalgorithm.\n\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe requirements for realizing a fully functioning\nquantum computer are daunting. There must be a scalable system of qubits which can be initialized and individually measured. It must be possible to enact a universal set of quantum gates on these qubits. And all this\nmust be done with sufficient accuracy so that quantum\nerror correction can be used to prevent decoherence from\nspoiling any computation.\nThe problems of error and decoherence are particularly\ndifficult ones for any proposed quantum computer. While\nthe states of classical computers are typically stored in\nmacroscopic degrees of freedom which have a built-in\nredundancy and thus are resistant to errors, building\nsimilar redundancy into quantum states is less natural.\nTo protect quantum information it is necessary to encode it using quantum error correcting code states.1,2\nThese states are highly entangled, and have the property that code states corresponding to different logical\nqubit states can be distinguished from one another only\nby global (\"topological\") measurements. Unlike states\nwhose macroscopic degrees of freedom are effectively classical (think of the magnetic moment of a small part of a\nhard drive), such highly entangled \"topologically degenerate\" states do not typically emerge as the ground states\nof physical Hamiltonians. One route to fault-tolerant\nquantum computation is therefore to build the encoding and fault-tolerant gate protocols into the \"software\"\nof the quantum computer.3\nA remarkable recent development in the theory of\nquantum computation which directly addresses these issues has been the realization that certain exotic states\nof matter in two space dimensions, so-called nonabelian\nstates, may provide a natural medium for storing and manipulating quantum information.4,5,6,7 In these states, localized quasiparticle excitations have quantum numbers\nwhich are in some ways similar to ordinary spin quantum numbers. However, unlike ordinary spins, the quantum information associated with these quantum numbers\nis stored globally, throughout the entire system, and so\nis intrinsically protected against decoherence. Further-\n\nmore, these quasiparticles satisfy so-called nonabelian\nstatistics. This means that when two quasiparticles are\nadiabatically moved around one another, while being\nkept sufficiently far apart, the action on the Hilbert space\nis represented by a unitary matrix which depends only\non the topology of the path used to carry out the exchange. Topological quantum computation can then be\ncarried out by moving quasiparticles around one another\nin two space dimensions.4,5 The quasiparticle world-lines\nform topologically nontrivial braids in three (= 2 + 1) dimensional space-time, and because these braids are topologically robust (i.e., they cannot be unbraided without\ncutting one of the strands) the resulting computation is\nprotected against error.\nNonabelian states are expected to arise in a variety of quantum many-body systems, including spin\nsystems,8,9,10 rotating Bose gases,11 and Josephson junction arrays.12 Of those states which have actually been\nexperimentally observed, the most likely to possess nonabelian quasiparticle excitations are certain fractional\nquantum Hall states. Moore and Read13 were the first to\npropose that quasiparticle excitations which obey nonabelian statistics might exist in the fractional quantum\nHall effect. Their proposal was based on the observation that the conformal blocks associated with correlation functions in the conformal field theory describing\nthe two-dimensional Ising model could be interpreted\nas quantum Hall wave functions. These wave functions\ndescribe both the ground state of a half-filled Landau\nlevel of spin-polarized electrons, as well as states with\nsome number of fractionally charged quasihole excitations (charge = e/4). The particular ground state this\nconstruction produces, the so-called Pfaffian, or MooreRead state, is considered the most likely candidate for the\nobserved fractional quantum Hall state at Landau level\nfilling fraction \u03bd = 5/2 (\u03bd = 1/2 in the second Landau\nlevel).14,15\nIn this conformal field theory construction, states with\nfour or more quasiholes present correspond to finitedimensional conformal blocks, and so the corresponding\nwave functions form a finite-dimensional Hilbert space.\nThe monodromy - or braiding properties - of these\n\n\f2\nconformal blocks are then assumed to describe the unitary transformations acting on the Hilbert space produced by adiabatically braiding quasiholes around one\nanother.13 Explicit wave functions for these states were\nworked out in Ref. 16, and the nonabelian braiding properties have been verified numerically in Ref. 17. In an\nalternate approach, the Moore-Read state can be viewed\nas a composite fermion superconductor in a so-called\n\"weak pairing\" px + ipy phase.18 In this description, the\nfinite-dimensional Hilbert space arises from zero energy\nsolutions of the Bogoliubov-DeGennes equations in the\npresence of vortices,18 and the vortices themselves are\nnonabelian quasiholes whose braiding properties have\nbeen shown to agree with the conformal field theory\nresult.19,20 Recently, a number of experiments have been\nproposed to directly probe the nonabelian nature of these\nexcitations.21,22,23,24\nUnfortunately, the braiding properties of quasihole excitations in the Moore-Read state are not sufficiently rich\nto carry out purely topological quantum computation,\nalthough \"partially\" topological quantum computation\nusing a mixture of topological and non-topological gates\nhas been shown to be possible.25,26 However, Read and\nRezayi27 have shown that the Moore-Read state is just\none of a sequence of states labeled by an index k corresponding to electrons at filling fractions \u03bd = k/(2 + k),\nwith k = 1 corresponding to the \u03bd = 1/3 Laughlin\nstate and k = 2 to the Moore-Read state. The wavefunctions for these states can be written as correlation\nfunctions in the Zk parafermion conformal field theory,27\nand the braiding properties of the quasihole excitations\nwere worked out in detail in Ref. 28. There it was shown\nthat the quasiholes are described by the SU (2)k ChernSimons-Witten (CSW) theories, up to overall abelian\nphase factors which are irrelevant for quantum computation. More recently, explicit quasihole wave functions\nhave been worked out for the k = 3 Read-Reazyi state,29\nwith results consistent with the predicted SU (2)3 braiding properties. The elementary braiding matrices for the\nSU (2)k CSW theory for k = 3 and k \u2265 5 have been\nshown to be sufficiently rich to carry out universal quantum computation, in the sense that any desired unitary\noperation on the Hilbert space of N quasiparticles, with\nN \u2265 3 for k \u2265 3, k 6= 4, 8, and N \u2265 4 for k = 8, can be\napproximated to any desired accuracy by a braid.5,6\nThe main purpose of this paper is to give an efficient\nmethod for determining braids which can be used to carry\nout a universal set of a quantum gates (i.e. single-qubit\nrotations and controlled-NOT gates) on encoded qubits\nfor the case k = 3, thought to be physically relevant for\nthe experimentally observed30 \u03bd = 12/5 fractional quantum Hall effect27,31 (\u03bd = 12/5 corresponds to \u03bd = 2/5 in\nthe second Landau level, and this is the particle-hole conjugate of \u03bd = 3/5 corresponding to k = 3). We refer to\nthe process of finding such braids as \"topological quantum compiling\" since these braids can then be used to\ntranslate a given quantum algorithm into the \"machine\ncode\" of a topological quantum computer. This is anal-\n\nogous to the action of an ordinary compiler which translates instructions written in a high level programming\nlanguage into the machine code of a classical computer.\nIt should be noted that the proof of universality for\nSU (2)3 quasiparticles is a constructive one,5,6 and therefore, as a matter of principle, it provides a prescription\nfor compiling quantum gates into braids. However, in\npractice, for two-qubit gates (such as controlled-NOT)\nthis prescription, if followed straightforwardly, is prohibitively difficult to carry out, primarily because it involves searching the space of braids with six or more\nstrands. We address this difficulty by dividing our twoqubit gate constructions into a series of smaller constructions, each of which only involves searching the space of\nthree-stranded braids (three-braids). The required threebraids then can be found efficiently and used to construct\nthe desired two-qubit gates. This \"divide and conquer\"\napproach does not, in general, yield the most accurate\nbraid of a given length which approximates a desired\nquantum gate. However, we believe that it does yield\nthe most accurate (or at least among the most accurate)\nbraids which can be obtained for a given fixed amount of\nclassical computing power.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we review the basic properties of the SU (2)k Hilbert space,\nand show that the case SU (2)3 is, for our purposes,\nequivalent to the case SO(3)3 \u2013 the so-called Fibonacci\nanyon model. Section III then presents a quick review\nof the mathematical machinery needed to compute with\nFibonacci anyons. In Sec. IV we outline how, in principle, these particles can be used to encode qubits suitable for quantum computation. Section V then describes\nhow to find braiding patterns for three Fibonacci anyons\nwhich can be used to carry out any allowed operation\non the Hilbert space of these quasiparticles to any desired accuracy, thus effectively implementing the procedure given in Ref. 5 for carrying out single-qubit rotations. In Sec. VI we discuss the more difficult case of twoqubit gates, and give two classes of explicit gate constructions - one, first discussed by the authors in Ref. 32, in\nwhich a pair of quasiparticles from one qubit is \"woven\"\nthrough the quasiparticles in the second qubit, and another, presented here for the first time, in which only a\nsingle quasiparticle is woven.

Here N is the number of q-spin 1/2 quasiparticles and\nS is the total q-spin of those quasiparticles. The number at\na given (N, S) vertex of each diagram indicates the number\nof paths to that vertex starting from the (0, 0) point. This\nnumber gives the dimensionality of the Hilbert space of N\nq-spin 1/2 quasiparticles with total q-spin S.\n\ncarried over to the quantum group case.\nIn the quantum group description of an SU (2)k CSW\ntheory, each quasiparticle has a half-integer q-deformed\nspin (q-spin) quantum number. Just as for ordinary spin,\nthere are rules for combining q-spin known as fusion rules.\nThe fusion rules for the SU (2)k theory are similar to the\nusual triangle rule for adding ordinary spin, except that\nthey are truncated so that there are no states with total\nq-spin > k/2. Specifically, the fusion rules for the level k\ntheory are,33\ns1 \u2297 s2 = |s1 \u2212 s2 | \u2295 |s1 \u2212 s2 | + 1 \u2295 . . .\n. . . \u2295 min(s1 + s2 , k \u2212 s1 \u2212 s2 ). (1)\nNote that in the quantum group description of nonabelian anyons, states are distinguished only by their total q-spin quantum numbers. The q-deformed analogs\nof the Sz quantum numbers are physically irrelevant -\nthere is no degeneracy associated with them, and they\nplay no role in any computation involving braiding.28\nThe situation is somewhat analogous to that of a collection of ordinary spin-1/2 particles in which the only\nallowed operations, including measurement, are rotationally invariant and hence independent of Sz , as is the case\nin exchange-based quantum computation.34\nThe fusion rules of the SU (2)k theory fix the structure\nof the Hilbert space of the system. For a collection of\nquasiparticles with q-spin 1/2, a useful way to visualize\nthis Hilbert space is in terms of its so-called Bratteli diagram. This diagram shows the different fusion paths for\nN q-spin 1/2 quasiparticles in which these quasiparticles\nare fused, one at a time, going from left to right in the\ndiagram. Bratteli diagrams for the cases k = 2 and k = 3\nare shown in Fig. 1.\nThe dimensionality of the Hilbert space for N q-spin\n\nFIG. 2: (color online). Graphical proof of the equivalence\nof braiding q-spin-1/2 and q-spin-1 objects for SU (2)3 . Part\n(a) shows a braiding pattern for a collection of objects, some\nhaving q-spin 1/2 and some having q-spin 1. Part (b) shows\nthe same braiding pattern but with the q-spin-1/2 objects\nrepresented by q-spin 1 objects fused with q-spin-3/2 objects,\nwhich, for SU (2)3 , has a unique fusion channel. Finally, part\n(c) shows the same braid with the q-spin-3/2 objects removed.\nBecause these q-spin-3/2 objects are effectively abelian for\nSU (2)3 , removing them from the braid will only result in\nan overall phase factor which will be irrelevant for quantum\ncomputing.\n\n1/2 quasiparticles with total q-spin S can be determined\nby counting the number of paths in the Bratteli diagram\nfrom the origin to the point (N, S). The results of this\npath counting are also shown in Fig. 1, where one can\nsee the well-known 2N/2\u22121 Hilbert space degeneracy for\nthe k = 2 (Moore-Read) case,13,16 and the Fibonnaci\ndegeneracy for the k = 3 case.27\nIn this paper we will focus on the k = 3 case, which is\nthe lowest k value for which SU (2)k nonabelian anyons\nare universal for quantum computation.5,6 In fact, we will\nshow that two-qubit gates are particularly simple for this\ncase. Before proceeding, it is convenient to introduce an\nimportant property of the SU (2)3 theory, namely that\nthe braiding properties of q-spin 1/2 quasiparticles are\nthe same as those with q-spin 1 (up to an overall abelian\nphase which is irrelevant for topological quantum computation). This is a useful observation because the theory of\nq-spin 1 quasiparticles in SU (2)3 is equivalent to SO(3)3 ,\na theory also known as the Fibonacci anyon theory35,36\n- a particularly simple theory with only two possible\nvalues of q-spin, 0 and 1, for which the fusion rules are\n0 \u2297 0 = 0,\n\n0 \u2297 1 = 1 \u2297 0 = 1,\n\n1 \u2297 1 = 0 \u2295 1. (2)\n\nHere we give a rough proof of this equivalence. This\nproof is based on the fact that for k = 3 the fusion rules\ninvolving q-spin 3/2 quasiparticles take the following simple form\n3\n3\n\u2297s =\n\u2212 s.\n2\n2\n\n(3)\n\nThe key observation is that since for k = 3 the highest\npossible q-spin is 3/2, when fusing a q-spin-3/2 object\nwith any other object (here we use the term object to\ndescribe either a single quasiparticle or a group of quasiparticles viewed as a single composite entity), the Hilbert\n\n\f4\nspace dimensionality does not grow. This implies that\nmoving a q-spin-3/2 object around other objects can, at\nmost, produce an overall abelian phase factor. While this\nphase factor may be important physically, particularly in\ndetermining the outcome of interference experiments involving nonabelian quasiparticles,21,22,23,24 it is irrelevant\nfor quantum computing, and thus does not matter when\ndetermining braids which correspond to a given computation. Because (3) implies that a q-spin-1/2 object can\nbe viewed as the result of fusing a q-spin-1 object with a\nq-spin-3/2 object, it follows that the braid matrices for qspin-1/2 objects are the same as that for q-spin-1 objects\nup to an overall phase (as can be explicitly checked).\nIn fact, based on this argument we can make a stronger\nstatement. Imagine a collection of SU (2)3 objects which\neach have either q-spin 1 or q-spin 1/2. It is then possible to carry out topological quantum computation, even\nif we do not know which objects have q-spin 1 and which\nhave q-spin 1/2. The proof is illustrated in Fig. 2. Figure\n2(a) shows a braiding pattern for a collection of objects,\nsome of which have q-spin 1/2 and some of which have qspin 1. Fig. 2(b) then shows the same braiding pattern,\nbut now all objects with q-spin 1/2 are represented by\nobjects with q-spin 1 fused to objects with q-spin 3/2.\nBecause, as noted above, the q-spin 3/2 objects have\ntrivial (abelian) braiding properties, the unitary transformation produced by this braid is the same, up to an\noverall abelian phase, as that produced by braiding nothing but q-spin 1 objects, as shown in Fig. 2(c). It follows\nthat provided one can measure whether the total q-spin\nof some object belongs to the class 1 \u2261 {1, 1/2} or the\nclass 0 \u2261 {0, 3/2} - something which should, in principle, be possible by performing interference experiments\nas described in Refs. 37 and 38 - then quantum computation is possible, even if we do not know which objects\nhave q-spin 1/2 and which have q-spin 1.\n\nIII.\n\nFIBONACCI ANYON BASICS\n\nHaving reduced the problem of compiling braids for\nSU (2)3 to compiling braids for SO(3)3 , i.e. Fibonacci\nanyons, it is useful for what follows to give more details\nabout the mathematical structure associated with these\nquasiparticles. For an excellent review of this topic see\nRef. 35, and for the mathematics of nonabelian particles\nin general see Ref. 39.\nNote that for the rest of this paper, except for Sec.\nVII, it should be understood that each quasiparticle is a\nq-spin 1 Fibonacci anyon. It should also be understood\nthat from the point of view of their nonabelian properties quasihole excitations are also q-spin 1 Fibonacci\nanyons, even though they have opposite electric charge\nand give opposite abelian phase factors when braided.\nBecause it is the nonabelian properties which are relevant\nfor topological quantum computation, for our purposes\nquasiparticles and quasiholes can be viewed as identical\nnonabelian particles.

Basis states for the Hilbert space of\n(a) two and (b) three Fibonacci anyons. SU (2)3 Bratteli diagrams showing fusion paths corresponding to the basis states\nfor the Hilbert space of two and three q-spin 1/2 quasiparticles\nare shown. The q-spin axes on these diagrams are labeled both\nby the SU (2)3 q-spin quantum numbers 0, 1/2, 1 and 3/2 and,\nto the left of these in bold, the corresponding Fibonacci q-spin\nquantum numbers 0 \u2261 {0, 3/2} and 1 \u2261 {1/2, 1}. Beneath\neach Bratteli diagram the same state is represented using a\nnotation in which dots correspond to Fibonacci anyons, and\ngroups of Fibonacci anyons enclosed in ovals labeled by q-spin\nquantum numbers are in the corresponding q-spin eigenstates.\n\nguish between the two (as when we discuss creating and\nfusing quasiparticles and quasiholes in Sec. IV) we will\nsimply use the terms quasiparticle or Fibonacci anyon to\nrefer to either excitation.\nFigure 3 establishes some of the notation for representing Fibonacci anyons which will be used in the rest\nof the paper. This figure shows SU (2)3 Bratteli diagrams in which the q-spin axis is labeled both by the\nSU (2)3 q-spin quantum numbers and, in boldface, the\ncorresponding Fibonacci q-spin quantum numbers, i.e. 0\nfor {0, 3/2} and 1 for {1/2, 1}. In Fig. 3(a) Bratteli diagrams showing fusion paths corresponding to two basis\nstates spanning the two-dimensional Hilbert space of two\nFibonacci anyons are shown. Beneath each Bratteli diagram an alternate representation of the corresponding\nstate is also shown. In this representation dots correspond to Fibonacci anyons and ovals enclose collections\nof Fibonacci anyons which are in q-spin eigenstates whenever the oval is labeled by a total q-spin quantum number.\n(Note: If the oval is not labeled, it should be understood\nthat the enclosed quasiparticles may not be in a q-spin\neigenstate).\nIn the text we will use the notation \u2022 to represent a\nFibonacci anyon, and the ovals will be represented by\nparentheses. In this notation, the two states shown in\nFig. 3(a) are denoted (\u2022, \u2022)0 and (\u2022, \u2022)1 .\nFig. 3(b) shows Bratteli diagram, again with both\nSU (2)3 and Fibonacci quantum numbers, with fusion\n\n\f5\npaths which this time correspond to three basis states\nof the three-dimensional Hilbert space of three Fibonacci\nanyons. Beneath these diagrams the \"oval\" representations of these three states are also shown, which in\nthe text will be represented ((\u2022, \u2022)0 , \u2022)1 , ((\u2022, \u2022)1 , \u2022)1 and\n((\u2022, \u2022)1 , \u2022)0 .\nIn addition to fusion rules, all theories of nonabelian\nanyons possess additional mathematical structure which\nallows one to calculate the result of any braiding operation. This structure is characterized by the F (fusion)\nand R (rotation) matrices.35,39,40\nTo define the F matrix, note that the Hilbert space\nof three Fibonacci anyons is spanned both by the three\nstates labeled ((\u2022, \u2022)a , \u2022)c , and the three states labeled\n(\u2022, (\u2022, \u2022)b )c . The F matrix is the unitary transformation\nwhich maps one of these bases to the other,\nX\nc\n(\u2022, (\u2022, \u2022)a )c =\nFab\n((\u2022, \u2022)b , \u2022)c ,\n(4)\nb\n\nand has the form\n\u221a\n\u03c4\n\u221a\u03c4\nF = \uf8ed \u03c4 \u2212\u03c4\n\uf8eb\n\n1\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f8,\n\n(5)\n\n\u221a\nwhere \u03c4 = ( 5 \u2212 1)/2 is the inverse of the golden mean.\n1\nIn this matrix the upper left 2\u00d72 block, Fab\n, acts on\nthe two-dimensional total q-spin 1 sector of the threequasiparticle Hilbert space and the lower right matrix\n0\nelement, F11\n= 1, acts on the unique total q-spin 0 state.\nNote that this F matrix can be applied to any three\nobjects which each have q-spin 1, where each object can\nconsist of more than one Fibonacci anyon. Furthermore,\nif one considers three objects for which one or more of\nthe objects has q-spin 0, then the state of these objects is\nuniquely determined by the total q-spin of all three, and\nin this case the F matrix is trivially the identity. Thus,\nfor the case of Fibonacci anyons, the matrix (5) is all\nthat is needed to make arbitrary basis changes for any\nnumber of Fibonacci anyons.\nThe R matrix gives the phase factor produced when\ntwo Fibonacci anyons are moved around one another with\na certain sense. One can think of these phase factors as\nthe q-deformed versions of the \u22121 or +1 phase factors\none obtains when interchanging two ordinary spin-1/2\nquasiparticles when they are in a singlet or triplet state,\nrespectively. This phase factor depends on the overall\nq-spin of the two quasiparticles involved in the exchange,\nso for Fibonacci anyons there are two such phase factors\nwhich are summarized in the R matrix,\n!\ne\u2212i4\u03c0/5\n0\nR=\n.\n(6)\n0\nei3\u03c0/5\nHere the upper left and lower right matrix elements are,\nrespectively, the phase factor that two Fibonacci anyons\nacquire if they are interchanged in a clockwise sense when\nthey have total q-spin 0 or q-spin 1.

(a) Four-quasparticle and (b) threequasiparticle qubit encodings for Fibonacci anyons. Part (a)\nshows two states which span the Hilbert space of four quasiparticles with total q-spin 0 which can be used as the logical\n|0L i and |1L i states of a qubit. Part (b) shows two states\nspanning the Hilbert space of three quasiparticles with total q-spin 1 which can also be used as logical qubit states\n|0L i and |1L i. This three-quasiparticle qubit can be obtained\nby removing the rightmost quasiparticle from the two states\nshown in (a). The third state shown in Part (b), labeled |N Ci\nfor \"noncomputational\", is the unique state of three quasiparticles which has total q-spin 0.\n\nalso applies if we exchange two objects that both have\ntotal q-spin 1, even if these objects consist of more than\none Fibonacci anyon. And if one or both objects has qspin 0, the result of this interchange is the identity. Again\nwe emphasize that in the k = 3 Read-Rezayi state, there\nwill be additional abelian phases present, which may have\nphysical consequences for some experiments, but which\nwill be irrelevant for topological quantum computation.\nTypically the sequence of F and R matrices used to\ncompute the unitary operation produced by a given braid\nis not unique. To guarantee that the result of any such\ncomputation is independent of this sequence, the F and\nR matrices must satisfy certain consistency conditions.\nThese consistency conditions, the so-called pentagon and\nhexagon equations,35,39,40 are highly restrictive, and, in\nfact, for the case of Fibonacci anyons essentially fix the\nF and R matrices to have the forms given above (up to\na choice of chirality, and Abelian phase factors which are\nagain irrelevant to our purposes here).35\nFinally, we point out an obvious, but important, consequence of the structure of the F and R matrices. When\ninterchanging any two quasiparticles which are part of a\nlarger set of quasiparticles with a well-defined total q-spin\nquantum number, this total q-spin quantum number will\nnot change.\n\nIV.\n\nQUBIT ENCODING AND GENERAL\nCOMPUTATION SCHEME\n\nBefore proceeding, it will be useful to have a specific scheme in mind for how one might actually carry\nout topological quantum computation with Fibonacci\n\n\f6\nanyons. Here we follow the scheme outlined in Ref. 7,\nwhich, for completeness, we briefly review below.\nThe computer can be initialized by pulling\nquasiparticle-quasihole pairs out of the \"vacuum\",\n(by vacuum we mean the ground state of the k = 3\nRead-Rezayi state or any other state which supports\nFibonacci anyon excitations). Each such pair will consist\nof two q-spin 1 excitations in a state with total q-spin\n0, i.e. the state (\u2022, \u2022)0 . In principle, this pair can also\nexist in a state with total q-spin 1, provided there are\nother quasiparticles present to ensure the total q-spin\nof the system is 0, so one can imagine using this pair\nas a qubit. However, it is impossible to carry out\narbitrary single-qubit operations by braiding only the\ntwo quasiparticles forming such a qubit - this braiding\nnever changes the total q-spin of the pair, and so only\ngenerates rotations about the z-axis in the qubit space.\nFor this reason it is convenient to encode qubits using more than two Fibonacci anyons. Thus, to create a qubit, two quasiparticle-quasihole pairs can be\npulled out of the vacuum. The resulting state is then\n((\u2022, \u2022)0 , (\u2022, \u2022)0 )0 which again has total q-spin 0. The\nHilbert space of four Fibonacci anyons with total q-spin\n0 is two dimensional, with basis states, which we can\ntake as logical qubit states, |0L i = ((\u2022, \u2022)0 , (\u2022, \u2022)0 )0 and\n|1L i = ((\u2022, \u2022)1 , (\u2022, \u2022)1 )0 , (see Fig 4(a)). The state of such\na four-quasiparticle qubit is determined by the total qspin of either the rightmost or leftmost pair of quasiparticles. Note that the fusion rules (2) imply that the total\nq-spin of these two pairs must be the same because the\ntotal q-spin of all four quasiparticles is 0.\nFor this encoding, in addition to the two-dimensional\ncomputational qubit space of four quasiparticles with\ntotal q-spin 0, there is a three-dimensional noncomputational Hilbert space of states with total q-spin 1\nspanned by the states ((\u2022, \u2022)0 , (\u2022, \u2022)1 )1 , ((\u2022, \u2022)1 , (\u2022, \u2022)0 )1\nand ((\u2022, \u2022)1 , (\u2022, \u2022)1 )1 . When carrying out topological\nquantum computation it is crucial to avoid transitions\ninto this noncomputational space.\nFortunately, single-qubit rotations can be carried out\nby braiding quasiparticles within a given qubit and, as\ndiscussed in Sec. III, such operations will not change the\ntotal q-spin of the four quasiparticles involved. Singlequbit operations can therefore be carried out without any\nundesirable transitions out of the encoded computational\nqubit space.\nTwo-qubit gates, however, will require braiding quasiparticles from different qubits around one another. This\nwill in general lead to transitions out of the encoded qubit\nspace. Nevertheless, given the so-called \"density\" result\nof Ref. 6 it is known that, as a matter of principle, one\ncan always find two-qubit braiding patterns which will\nentangle the two qubits, and also stay within the computational space to whatever accuracy is required for a\ngiven computation. The main purpose of this paper is to\nshow how such braiding patterns can be efficiently found.\nNote that the action of braiding the two leftmost\nquasiparticles in a four-quasiparticle qubit (referring to\n\n4IME\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0013\n\u0014\n\n\"\n\u0014\n\nFIG. 5: (color online). Space-time paths corresponding to the\ninitialization, manipulation through braiding, and measurement of an encoded qubit. Two quasiparticle-quasihole pairs\nare pulled out of the vacuum, with each pair having total qspin 0. The resulting state corresponds to a four-quasiparticle\nqubit in the state |0L i (see Fig. 4(a)). After some braiding,\nthe qubit is measured by trying to fuse the bottommost pair\n(in this case a quasiparticle-quasihole pair). If they fuse back\ninto the vacuum the result of the measurement is |0L i, otherwise it is |1L i. Because only the three lower quasiparticles\nare braided, the encoded qubit can also be viewed as a threequasiparticle qubit (see Fig. 4(b)) which is initialized in the\nstate |0L i.\n\nFig. 4(a)) is equivalent to that of braiding the two rightmost quasiparticles with the same sense. This is because\nas long as we are in the computational qubit space both\nthe leftmost and rightmost quasiparticle pairs must have\nthe same total q-spin, and so interchanging either pair\nwill result in the same phase factor from the R matrix.\nIt is therefore not necessary to braid all four quasiparticles to carry out single-qubit rotations - one need only\nbraid three.\nIn fact, one may consider qubits encoded using only\nthree quasiparticles with total q-spin 1, as originally proposed in Ref. 5. Such qubits can be initialized by first creating a four-quasiparticle qubit in the state |0L i, as outlined above, and then simply removing one of the quasiparticles. In this three-quasiparticle encoding, shown in\nFig. 4(b), the logical qubit states can be taken to be\n|0L i = ((\u2022, \u2022)0 , \u2022)1 and |1L i = ((\u2022, \u2022)1 , \u2022)1 . For this\nencoding there is just a single noncomputational state\n|N Ci = ((\u2022, \u2022)1 , \u2022)0 , also shown in Fig. 4(b). As for the\nfour-quasiparticle qubit, when carrying out single-qubit\nrotations by braiding within a three-quasiparticle qubit\nthe total q-spin of the qubit, in this case 1, remains unchanged and there are no transitions from the computational qubit space into the state |N Ci. However, just\nas for four-quasiparticle qubits, when carrying out twoqubit gates these transitions will in general occur and we\nmust work hard to avoid them. Henceforth we will refer\nto these unwanted transitions as leakage errors.\nNote that, because each three-quasiparticle qubit has\ntotal q-spin 1, when more than one of these qubits is\npresent the state of the system is not entirely characterized by the \"internal\" q-spin quantum numbers which\ndetermine the computational qubit states. It is also necessary to specify the state of what we will refer to as the\n\"external fusion space\" - the Hilbert space associated\nwith fusing the total q-spin 1 quantum numbers of each\nqubit. When compiling braids for three-quasiparticle\n\n\f7\nqubits it is crucial that the operations on the computational qubit space not depend on the state of this external\nfusion space - if they did, these two spaces would become entangled with one another leading to errors. Fortunately, we will see that it is indeed possible to find\nbraids which do not lead to such errors.\nFor the rest of this paper (except Sec. VII) we will\nuse this three-quasiparticle qubit encoding. It should be\nnoted that any braid which carries out a desired operation on the computational space for three-quasiparticle\nqubits will carry out the same operation on the computational space of four-quasiparticle qubits, with one quasiparticle in each qubit acting as a spectator. The braids\nwe find here can therefore be used for either encoding.\nWe can now describe how topological quantum computation might actually proceed, again following Ref. 7.\nA quantum circuit consisting of a sequence of one- and\ntwo-qubit gates which carries out a particular quantum\nalgorithm would first be translated (or \"compiled\") into\na braid by compiling each individual gate to whatever\naccuracy is required. Qubits would then be initialized\nby pulling quasiparticle-quasihole pairs out of the \"vacuum\". These localized excitations would then be adiabatically dragged around one another so that their worldlines trace out a braid in three-dimensional space-time\nwhich is topologically equivalent to the braid compiled\nfrom the quantum algorithm. Finally, individual qubits\nwould be measured by trying to fuse either the two rightmost or two leftmost excitations within them (referring\nto Fig. 4(a)) for four-quasiparticle qubits, or just the two\nleftmost excitations (referring to Fig. 4(b)) for threequasiparticle qubits. If this pair of excitations consists\nof a quasiparticle and a quasihole (and it will always be\npossible to arrange this), then, if the total q-spin of the\npair is 0, it will be possible for them to fuse back into\nthe \"vacuum\". However, if the total q-spin is 1 this will\nnot be possible. The resulting difference in the charge\ndistribution of the final state would then be measured to\ndetermine if the qubit was in the state |0L i or |1L i. Alternatively, as already mentioned in Sec. II, interference\nexperiments37,38 could be used to initialize and read out\nencoded qubits.\nAs a simple illustration, Fig. 5 shows a \"computation\"\nin which a four-quasiparticle qubit (which can also be\nviewed as a three-quasiparticle qubit if the top quasiparticle is ignored) is initialized by pulling quasiparticlequasihole pairs out of the vacuum, a single-qubit operation is carried out by braiding within the qubit, and the\nfinal state of the qubit is measured by fusing a quasiparticle and quasihole together and observing the outcome.\n\nV.\n\nCOMPILING THREE-BRAIDS AND\nSINGLE-QUBIT GATES\n\nWe now focus on the problem of finding braids for three\nFibonacci anyons (three-braids) which approximate any\nallowed unitary transformation on the Hilbert space of\n\n\u0083\\I?\n\nV\n\nV\n\n\u0083\\F\u0003?\u0003 \u00030 \u0003\u0083\\I?\n\n0\u0003\u0003\u0003 \u0e00\u0e00\u0e00\u0e00V \u0e00\u0e00\u0003V \u0003\u0003\u0003V \u0e00\u0003\u0003V \u0e00\u0003\u0003V \u0e00\u0003\u0003\u0003V \u0003\u0003\u0003\u0003V\n\nFIG. 6: (color online). Elementary three-braids and the decomposition of a general three-braid into a series of elementary braids. The unitary operation produced by this braid\nis computed by multiplying the corresponding sequence of\nelementary braid matrices, \u03c31 and \u03c32 (see text) and their inverses, as shown. Here the (unlabeled) ovals represent a particular basis choice for the three-quasiparticle Hilbert space,\nconsistent with that used in the text. In this and all subsequent figures which show braids, quasiparticles are aligned\nvertically, and we adopt the convention that reading from\nbottom to top in the figures corresponds to reading from left\nto right in expressions such as ((\u2022, \u2022)a , \u2022)c in the text. It\nshould be noted that these figures are only meant to represent\nthe topology of a given braid. In any actual implementation\nof topological quantum computation, quasiparticles will certainly not be arranged in a straight line, and they will have\nto be kept sufficiently far apart while being braided to avoid\nlifting the topological degeneracy.\n\nthese quasiparticles. This is important not only because\nit allows one to find braids which carry out arbitrary\nsingle-qubit rotations,5 but also because, as will be shown\nin Sec. VI, it is possible to reduce the problem of constructing braids which carry out two-qubit gates to that\nof finding a series of three-braids approximating specific\noperations.\nA.\n\nElementary Braid Matrices\n\nUsing the F and R matrices, it is straightforward to\ndetermine the elementary braiding matrices that act on\nthe three-dimensional Hilbert space of three Fibonacci\nanyons. If, as in Fig. 6, we take the basis states for the\nthree-quasiparticle Hilbert space to be the states labeled\n((\u2022, \u2022)a , \u2022)c then, in the ac = {01, 11, 10} basis, the matrix \u03c31 corresponding to a clockwise interchange of the\ntwo bottommost quasiparticles in the figure (or leftmost\nin the ((\u2022, \u2022)a , \u2022)c representation) is\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\ne\u2212i4\u03c0/5\n0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\u03c31 = \uf8ed\n(7)\n0\nei3\u03c0/5\n\uf8f8,\ni3\u03c0/5\ne\n\nwhere the upper left 2\u00d72 block acts on the total q-spin\n1 sector (|0iL and |1iL ) of the three quasiparticles, and\nthe lower right matrix element is a phase factor acquired\nby the q-spin 0 state (|N Ci). This matrix is easily read\n\n\f8\noff from the R matrix, since the total q-spin of the two\nquasiparticles being exchanged is well defined in this basis.\nTo find the matrix \u03c32 corresponding to a clockwise\ninterchange of the two topmost (or rightmost in the\n((\u2022, \u2022)a , \u2022)c representation) quasiparticles, we must first\nuse the F matrix to change bases to one in which the\ntotal q-spin of these quasiparticles is well defined. In\nthis basis, the braiding matrix is simply \u03c31 , and so, after\nchanging back to the original basis, we find\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\u221a \u2212i3\u03c0/5\n\u2212\u03c4 e\u2212i\u03c0/5\n\u03c4e\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\u221a\n\u03c32 = F \u22121 \u03c31 F = \uf8ed \u03c4 e\u2212i3\u03c0/5\n\u2212\u03c4\n\uf8f8 . (8)\ni3\u03c0/5\ne\nThe unitary transformation corresponding to a given\nthree-braid can now be computed by representing it as a\nsequence of elementary braid operations and multiplying\nthe corresponding sequence of \u03c31 and \u03c32 matrices and\ntheir inverses, as shown in Fig. 6.\nIf we are only concerned with single-qubit rotations,\nthen we only care about the action of these matrices on\nthe encoded qubit space with total q-spin 1, and not\nthe total q-spin 0 sector corresponding to the noncomputational state. However, in our two-qubit gate constructions, various three-braids will be embedded into the\nbraiding patterns of six quasiparticles, and in this case\nthe action on the full three-dimensional Hilbert space\ndoes matter.\nTo understand this action note that \u03c31 can be written\n!\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\u00b1e\u2212i7\u03c0/10\n0\n\u2212i\u03c0/10\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec \u00b1e\n\u03c31 = \uf8ed\n0\n\u00b1ei7\u03c0/10\n\uf8f8 , (9)\nei3\u03c0/5\n\nwhere the upper 2 \u00d7 2 block acting on the total q-spin\n1 sector is an SU (2) matrix, (i.e., a 2 \u00d7 2 unitary matrix with determinant 1), multiplied by a phase factor of\neither +e\u2212i\u03c0/10 or \u2212e\u2212i\u03c0/10 , and the lower right matrix\nelement, ei3\u03c0/5 , is the phase acquired by the total q-spin\n0 state. The phase factor pulled out of the upper 2 \u00d7 2\nblock is only defined up to \u00b11 because any SU (2) matrix\nmultiplied by \u22121 is also an SU (2) matrix.\nFrom (8) it follows that \u03c32 can be written in a similar fashion, with the same phase factors. Each clockwise braiding operation then corresponds to applying an\nSU (2) operation multiplied by a phase factor of \u00b1e\u2212i\u03c0/10\nto the q-spin 1 sector, while at the same time multiplying\nthe q-spin 0 sector by a phase factor of ei3\u03c0/5 . Likewise,\neach counterclockwise braiding operation corresponds to\napplying an SU (2) operation multiplied by a phase factor of \u00b1e+i\u03c0/10 to the q-spin 1 sector and a phase factor\nof e\u2212i3\u03c0/5 to the q-spin 0 sector.\nWe define the winding, W (B), of a given three-braid B,\nto be the total number of clockwise interchanges minus\nthe total number of counterclockwise interchanges. It\nthen follows that the unitary operation corresponding to\n\nan arbitrary braid B can always be expressed\nU (B) =\n\n\u00b1e\u2212iW (B)\u03c0/10 [SU (2)]\n\nei3W (B)\u03c0/5\n\n!\n\n, (10)\n\nwhere [SU (2)] indicates an SU (2) matrix. Thus, for a\ngiven three-braid, the phase relation between the total\nq-spin 1 and total q-spin 0 sectors of the corresponding\nunitary operation is determined by the winding of the\nbraid. We will refer to (10) often in what follows. It\ntells us precisely what unitary operations can be approximated by three-braids, and places useful restrictions on\ntheir winding.\nB.\n\nWeaving and Brute Force Search\n\nAt this point it is convenient to restrict ourselves to\na subclass of braids which we will refer to as weaves. A\nweave is any braid which is topologically equivalent to\nthe space-time paths of some number of quasiparticles in\nwhich only a single quasiparticle moves. It was shown in\nRef. 41 that this restricted class of braids is universal for\nquantum computation, provided the unitary representation of the braid group is dense in the space of all unitary\ntransformations on the relevant Hilbert space, which is\nthe case for Fibonacci anyons.\nFollowing Ref. 41 we will borrow some weaving terminology and refer to the mobile quasiparticle (or collection\nof quasiparticles) as the \"weft\" quasiparticle(s) and the\nstatic quasiparticles as the \"warp\" quasiparticles.\nOne reason for focusing on weaves is that weaving will\nlikely be easier to accomplish technologically than general braiding. This is true even if the full computation\ninvolves not just weaving a single quasiparticle, as was\nproposed in Ref. 41, but possibly weaving several quasiparticles at the same time in different regions of the computer - carrying out quantum gates on different qubits\nin parallel.\nConsidering weaves has the added (and more immediate) benefit of simplifying the problem of numerically\nsearching for three-braids which approximate desired\ngates. For the full braid group, even on just three strands,\nthere is a great deal of redundancy since braids which are\ntopologically equivalent will yield the same unitary operation. Weaves, however, naturally provide a unique representation in which the warp strands are straight, and\nthe weft weaves around them. There is therefore no trivial \"double counting\" of topologically equivalent weaves\nwhen one does a brute force numerical search of weaves\nup to some given length.\nThe unitary operations performed by weaving three\nquasiparticles in which the weft quasiparticle starts and\nends in the middle position, will always have the form\nn\n\nUweave ({ni }) = \u03c31nm \u03c32 m\u22121 * * * \u03c31n3 \u03c32n2 \u03c31n1 .\n\n(11)\n\nHere the sequence of exponents n2 , n3 * * * nm\u22121 all take\ntheir values from {\u00b12, \u00b14}, and n1 and nm can take the\n\n\f9\n8\n\n6\n\nln 1\n\u03b5\n\nvalues {0, \u00b12, \u00b14}. Because these exponents are all even,\neach factor in this sequence takes the weft quasiparticle\nall the way around one of the two warp quasiparticles\neither once or twice with either a clockwise or counterclockwise sense, returning it to the middle position. We\nallow n1 and nm to be 0 to account for the possibility\nthat the initial or final weaving operations could each\nbe either \u03c31n or \u03c32n with n = \u00b12 or \u00b14. Note that we\nneed only consider exponents ni up to \u00b14 (i.e., moving\nthe weft quasiparticle at most two times around a warp\nquasiparticle) because of the fact that \u03c3i10 = 1 for Fibonacci anyons, implying, e.g., \u03c3i6 = \u03c3i\u22124 . We define the\nlength L of such weaves to be equal\nthe total number\nPto\nm\nof elementary crossings, thus L = i=1 |ni |.\nWe will also consider weaves in which the weft quasiparticle begins and/or ends at a position other than the\nmiddle. These possibilities can easily be taken into account by multiplying Uweave ({ni }), as defined in (11), by\nthe appropriate factors of \u03c31 or \u03c32 on the right and/or\nleft. Thus, for example, the unitary operation produced\nby a weave in which the weft quasiparticle starts in the\ntop position and ends in the middle position can be written Uweave ({ni })\u03c32 , where, because of the extra factor\nof \u03c32 , the first braiding operations carried out by this\nweave will be \u03c32n where n is an odd power, n = \u00b11, \u00b13\nor 5. This will weave the weft quasiparticle from the\ntop position to the middle position after which Uweave\nwill simply continue weaving this quasiparticle eventually ending with it in the middle position. (Note that\nby multiplying Uweave on the right by \u03c32 , and not \u03c32\u22121 ,\nwe are not requiring the initial elementary braid to be\nclockwise, since Uweave may have n1 = 0 and n2 = \u22122\nor \u22124 so that the initial \u03c32 is immediately multiplied by\n\u03c32 to a negative power.) Similarly, the unitary operation\nproduced by a weave in which the weft particle starts in\nthe top position and ends in the bottom position can be\nwritten \u03c31 Uweave ({ni })\u03c32 , and so on.\nTo find a weave for which the corresponding unitary\noperation Uweave ({ni }) approximates a particular desired\nunitary operation, the most straightforward approach is\nto simply perform a brute force search over all weaves,\ni.e. all sequences {ni } as described above, up to a certain length L, in order to find the Uweave ({ni }) which is\nclosest to the target operation. Here we will take as a\nmeasure of the distance between two operators U and V\nthe operator norm distance \u01eb(U, V ) = ||U \u2212 V || where\n||O|| is the operator norm, defined to be the square root\nof the highest eigenvalue of O\u2020 O. Again, if we are interested in fixing the relative phase of the total q-spin 1 and\ntotal q-spin 0 sectors then we would restrict the winding\nof the weaves so that the phases in (10) match those of\nthe desired target gate.\nFor example, imagine our goal is to find a weave which\napproximates the unitary operation,\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n0 i\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\niX = \uf8ed i 0 \uf8f8 .\n(12)\n1\n\n4\n\n2\n\n0\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\nL\n\nFIG. 7: ln 1\u01eb vs. braid length L for weaves approximating the\ngate iX. Here \u01eb is the distance (defined in terms of operator\nnorm) between iX and the unitary transformation produced\nby a weave of length L which best approximates it. The line\nis a guide to the eye.\n\nIf the resulting weave were to be used only for a singlequbit operation, then we would only require that the\nweave approximate the upper left 2 \u00d7 2 block of iX up to\nan overall phase and we would not care about the phase\nfactor appearing in the lower right matrix element. There\nwould then be no constraint on the winding of the braid.\nHowever, for this example we will assume that this weave\nwill be used in a two-qubit gate construction, for which\nthe overall phase and/or the phase difference between the\ntotal q-spin 1 and total q-spin 0 sectors will matter.\nIn this case, by comparing iX to (10), we see that the\nwinding W of any weave approximating iX must satisfy\nei3\u03c0W/5 = 1 or W = 0 (modulo 10). Results of a brute\nforce search over weaves satisfying this winding requirement which approximate iX are shown in Fig. 7. In this\nfigure, ln 1\u01eb is plotted vs. braid length L, where \u01eb is the\nminimum distance between Uweave and iX for weaves of\nlength L. It is expected that, for any such brute force\nsearch for weaves approximating a generic target operation, the length should scale with distance according to\nL \u223c log 1\u01eb , because the number of braids grows exponentially with L. The results shown in Fig. 7 are consistent\nwith such logarithmic scaling.\nAll the brute force searches used to find braids in\nthis paper are straightforward sequential searches, meant\nmainly to demonstrate proof of principle. No doubt more\nsophisticated brute force search methods (e.g. bidirectional search) could be used to perform deeper searches\nresulting in longer and more accurate braids. Nevertheless, the exponential growth in the number of braids with\nL implies that finding optimal braids by any brute force\nsearch method will rapidly become infeasible as L increases. Fortunately one can still systematically improve\na given braid to any desired accuracy by applying the\nSolovay-Kitaev algorithm,42,43 which we now briefly review.\n\n\f10\nC.\n\nImplementation of the Solovay-Kitaev\nAlgorithm for Braids\n\nThe general result of the Solovay-Kitaev theorem tells\nus that we can efficiently improve the accuracy of any\ngiven braid without the need to perform exhaustive brute\nforce searches of ever improving accuracy.42,43 The essential ingredient in this procedure is an \u01eb-net - a discrete\nset of operators which in the present case correspond to\nfinite braids up to some given length, with the property\nthat for any desired unitary operator there exists an element of the \u01eb-net which is within some given distance\n\u01eb0 of that operator. Provided \u01eb0 is sufficiently small, the\nSolovay-Kitaev algorithm gives us a clever way to pick a\nfinite number of braid segments out of the \u01eb-net and sew\nthem together so that the resulting gate will be an approximation to the desired gate with improved accuracy.\nThe implementation of the Solovay-Kitaev algorithm\nwe use here follows closely that described in detail in\nRefs. 44 and 45. The first step of this algorithm is to\nfind a braid which approximates the desired gate, U , by\nperforming a brute force search over the \u01eb-net. Let U0\ndenote the result of this search. Since we know that\n\u01eb(U0 , U ) \u2264 \u01eb0 it follows that C = U U0\u22121 is an operator\nwhich is within a distance \u01eb0 of the identity.\nThe next step is to decompose C as a group commutator. This means that we find two unitary operators\nA and B for which C = ABA\u22121 B \u22121 . The unitary operators A and B are chosen so that their action on the\ncomputational qubit space corresponds to small rotations\nthrough the same angle but about perpendicular axes.\nFor this choice, if A and B are then approximated by operators A0 and B0 in the \u01eb-net, it can readily be shown\n\u22121\nthat the operator C0 = A0 B0 A\u22121\n0 B0 , will approximate\n3/2\nC to a distance of order \u01eb0 . It follows that the op\u22121\nerator U1 = A0 B0 A\u22121\n0 B0 U0 is an approximation to U\n3/2\nwithin a distance \u01eb1 \u2243 c\u01eb0 , where c is a constant which\ndetermines the size of the \u01eb-net needed to guarantee an\nimprovement in accuracy.\nWhat we have just described corresponds to one iteration of the Solovay-Kitaev algorithm. Subsequent iterations are carried out recursively. Thus, at the second\nlevel of approximation each search within the \u01eb-net is\nreplaced by the procedure described above, and so on,\nso that at the nth level all approximations are made at\nthe (n \u2212 1)st level. The result of this recursive process\nis a braid whose accuracy grows superexponentially in\nn, with the distance\nto the desired gate being of order\nn\n\u01ebn \u223c (c2 \u01eb0 )(3/2) at the nth level of recursion, while\nthe braid length grows only exponentially in n, with\nL \u223c 5n L0 , where L0 is a typical braid length in the initial \u01eb-net. Thus, as the distance of the approximate gate\nfrom the desired target gate, \u01eb, goes to zero, the braid\nlength grows only polylogarithmically, with L \u223c log\u03b1 1\u01eb\nwhere \u03b1 = ln 5/ ln(3/2) \u2243 3.97. While this scaling is,\nof course, worse than the logarithmic scaling for brute\nforce searching, it is still only a polylogarithmic increase\n\n8\u0013\n$\u0013\n%\u0013\n8\u0014\n\nFIG. 8: (color online). One iteration of the Solovay-Kitaev\nalgorithm applied to finding a braid which approximates the\noperation U = iX. The braid U0 is the result of a brute\nforce search over weaves up to length 44 which best approximates the desired gate U = iX, with an operator norm\ndistance between U and U0 of \u01eb \u2243 8.5 \u00d7 10\u22124 . The braids\nA0 and B0 are the results of similar brute force searches\nto approximate unitary operations A and B whose group\ncommutator satisfies ABA\u22121 B \u22121 = U U0\u22121 . The new braid\n\u22121\nU1 = A0 B0 A\u22121\n0 B0 U0 is then five times longer than U0 , and\nthe accuracy has improved so that the distance to the target\ngate is now \u01eb1 \u2243 4.2 \u00d7 10\u22125 . Given the group commutator\n\u22121\nfactor, the winding of the U1\nstructure of the A0 B0 A\u22121\n0 B0\nbraid is the same as the U0 braid. Note that when joining\nbraids to form U1 it is possible that elementary braid operations from one braid will multiply their own inverses in\nanother braid, allowing the total braid to be shortened. Here\nwe have left these \"redundant\" braids in U1 , as the careful\nreader should be able to find.\n\nin braid length which is sufficient for quantum computation. Similar arguments44,45 can be used to show that\nthe classical computer time t required to carry out the\nSolovay-Kitaev algorithm also only scales polylogarithmically in the desired accuracy, with t \u223c log\u03b2 1\u01eb where\n\u03b2 = ln 3/ ln(3/2) \u2243 2.71.\nIt is worth noting that there is a particularly nice feature of this implementation of the Solovay-Kitaev algorithm when applied to compiling three-braids. Recall\nthat when carrying out two-qubit gates it will be crucial\nto maintain the phase difference between the total q-spin\n1 and total q-spin 0 sectors of the three-quasiparticle\nHilbert space associated with a given three-braid, and,\naccording to (10), this can be done by fixing the winding\nof the braid (modulo 10). Because of the group commutator structure of the Solovay-Kitaev algorithm, the winding of the nth -level approximation Un will be the same as\nthat of the initial approximation U0 . This is because all\nsubsequent improvements involve multiplying this braid\n\u22121\nby group commutators of the form An Bn A\u22121\nn Bn which\nautomatically have zero winding. The phase relationship\nbetween the total q-spin 1 and total q-spin 0 sectors is\n\n\f11\n\n\u0014\n\n\"\n\n\u0014\n\n\"\n\nFIG. 9: (color online). Two encoded qubits and a generic\nbraid. Because quasiparticles are braided outside of their\nstarting qubits these braids will generally lead to leakage out\nof the computational qubit space, i.e. the q-spin of each group\nof three quasiparticles forming these qubits will in general no\nlonger be 1.\n\ntherefore preserved at every level of the construction.\nFig. 8 shows the application of one iteration of the\nSolovay-Kitaev algorithm applied to finding a braid\nwhich generates a unitary operation approximating iX.\nThe braid labeled U0 is the result of a brute force search\nwith L = 44 corresponding to the best approximation\nshown in Fig. 7. (Note that although this braid is drawn\nas a sequence of elementary braid operations, it is topologically equivalent to a weave. In fact precisely this\nbraid, drawn explicitly as a weave, is shown in Fig. 13.)\nThe braids labeled A0 and B0 generate unitary operations which approximate operators A and B whose group\ncommutator gives U U0\u22121 where U = iX. Finally, the\nbraid labeled U1 is the new, more accurate, approximate\nweave.\n\nVI.\n\nTWO-QUBIT GATES\n\nWe have seen that single-qubit gates are \"easy\" in the\nsense that as long as we braid within an encoded qubit\nthere will be no leakage errors (the overall q-spin of the\ngroup of three quasiparticles will remain 1). Furthermore, the space of unitary operators acting on the threequasiparticle Hilbert space (essentially SU (2)) is small\nenough to find excellent approximate braids by performing brute force searches and subsequent improvement using the Solovay-Kitaev algorithm. We now turn to the\nsignificantly harder problem of finding braids which approximate entangling two-qubit gates.\n\nA.\n\n\"Divide and Conquer\" Approach\n\nFigure 9 depicts six quasiparticles encoding two qubits\nand a general braiding pattern. To entangle these qubits,\nquasiparticles from one qubit must be braided around\nquasiparticles from the other qubit, and this will inevitably lead to leakage out of the encoded qubit space,\n(i.e. the overall q-spin of the three quasiparticles constituting a qubit may no longer be 1). Furthermore,\nthe space of all operators acting on the Hilbert space of\nsix quasiparticles is much bigger than for three, making\n\nFIG. 10: (color online). A two-qubit gate construction in\nwhich a pair of quasiparticles from the top (control) qubit is\nwoven through the bottom (target) qubit. The mobile pair\nof quasiparticles is referred to as the control pair and has a\ntotal q-spin of 0 if the control qubit is in the state |0L i, and\n1 if the control qubit is in the state |1L i. Since weaving an\nobject with total q-spin 0 yields the identity operation, this\nconstruction is guaranteed to result in a transformation of the\ntarget qubit state only if the control qubit is in the state |1L i.\nNote that in this and subsequent figures world-lines of mobile\nquasiparticles will always be dark blue.\n\nbrute force searching extremely difficult. Here the unitary operations acting on this space are in SU (5)\u2295SU (8),\n(up to winding dependent phase factors as in (10)), which\nhas 87 free parameters as opposed to 3 for the three quasiparticle case of SU (2).\nStill, as a matter of principle, it is possible to perform a brute force search of sufficient depth so that\nit corresponds to a fine enough \u01eb-net to carry out the\nSolovay-Kitaev algorithm in this larger space.42 This is\nessentially the program outlined in Ref. 5 as an \"existence proof\" that universal quantum computation is possible; however, it is not at all clear that, even if one\ncould do this, it would be the most efficient procedure\nfor compiling braids. For the same amount of classical\ncomputing power required to directly compile braids in\nSU (5) \u2295 SU (8), we believe one can find much more efficient (in the sense of having a more accurate computation with a shorter braid) braids by breaking the problem\ninto smaller problems, each consisting of finding a specific three-braid embedded in the full six-braid space. As\nwe've shown above, these three-braids can then be very\nefficiently compiled.\nHere we present two classes of two-qubit gate constructions based on this \"divide and conquer\" approach. The\nfirst of these were originally introduced by the authors in\nRef. 32 and are characterized by the weaving of a pair of\nquasiparticles from one qubit through the quasiparticles\nforming the second qubit. The second class, presented\nhere for the first time, can be carried out by weaving\nonly a single quasiparticle from one qubit around one\nother quasiparticle from the same qubit, and two quasiparticles from the second qubit.\n\nB.\n\nTwo-Quasiparticle Weave Construction\n\nWe now review the two-qubit gate constructions first\ndiscussed in Ref. 32. The basic idea behind these constructions is illustrated in Fig. 10. This figure shows two\n\n\f12\n\nFIG. 11: (color online). An effective braiding weave, and\na two-qubit gate constructed using this weave. The effective braiding weave is a woven three-braid which produces a\nunitary operation which is a distance \u01eb \u2243 2.3 \u00d7 10\u22123 from\nthat produced by simply interchanging the two target particles (\u03c312 ). When the control pair is woven through the target\nqubit using this weave the resulting two-qubit gate approximates a controlled-(\u03c322 ) gate to a distance \u01eb \u2243 1.9 \u00d7 10\u22123 or\n\u01eb \u2243 1.6 \u00d7 10\u22123 when the total q-spin of the two qubits is 0 or\n1, respectively.\n\nqubits and a braiding pattern in which a pair of quasiparticles from the top qubit (the control qubit) is woven through the quasiparticles forming the bottom qubit\n(the target qubit). Throughout this braiding the pair is\ntreated as a single immutable object which, at the end of\nthe braid, is returned to its original position.\nIf, as in Fig. 10, we choose the pair of weft quasiparticles to be the two quasiparticles whose total q-spin determines the logical state of the qubit, then we refer to\nthis pair as the control pair. We can then immediately\nsee why this construction naturally suggests itself. If the\ncontrol qubit is in the state |0L i the control pair will\nhave total q-spin 0, and weaving this pair through the\ntarget qubit will have no effect. We are thus guaranteed\nthat if the control qubit is in the state |0L i the identity\noperation is performed on the target qubit.\nThe only non-trivial effect of this weaving pattern occurs when the control qubit is in the state |1L i. In this\ncase, the control pair has total q-spin 1 and so behaves as\na single Fibonacci anyon. The problem of constructing a\ntwo-qubit controlled gate then corresponds to finding a\nweaving pattern in which a single Fibonacci anyon weaves\nthrough the three quasiparticles of the target qubit, inducing a transition on this qubit without inducing leakage error out of the computational qubit space, or at least\nkeeping such leakage as small as required for a particular\ncomputation. This reduces the problem of finding a twoqubit gate to that of finding a weaving pattern in which\none Fibonacci anyon weaves around three others - a\nproblem involving only four Fibonacci anyons. However,\nfollowing our \"divide and conquer\" philosophy, we will\nfurther narrow our focus to weaving a single Fibonacci\nanyon through only two others at a time.\nWe define an \"effective braiding\" weave, to be a woven\nthree-braid in which the weft quasiparticle starts at the\ntop position, and returns to the top position at the end of\nthe weave, with the requirement that the unitary transformation it generates be approximately equal to that\nproduced by m clockwise interchanges of the two warp\n\nFIG. 12: (color online). An injection weave, and step one\nin our injection based gate construction. The box labeled I\nrepresents an ideal (infinite) injection weave which is approximated by the weave shown to a distance \u01eb \u2243 1.5 \u00d7 10\u22123 . In\nstep one of our gate construction, this injection weave is used\nto weave the control pair into the target qubit. If the control qubit is in the state |1L i then a = 1 and the result is to\nproduce a target qubit with the same quantum numbers as\nthe original, but with its middle quasiparticle replaced by the\ncontrol pair.\n\nquasiparticles. To find such weaves we perform a brute\nforce search, as outlined in Sec. V, over sequences {ni }\nwhich approximately satisfy\n\u03c32 Uweave ({ni }) \u03c32 \u2243 \u03c31m .\n\n(13)\n\nIf both sides of this equation are expressed using (10) it\nbecomes evident that the winding of any effective braiding weave must satisfy W = m (modulo 10). Since the\nweft particle starts and ends in the top position, W must\nbe even, thus effective braiding weaves only exist for even\nm.\nAn example of an m = 2 effective braiding weave found\nthrough a brute force search is shown in Fig. 11. The\ncorresponding unitary operation approximates that of interchanging the two warp quasiparticles twice to a distance \u01eb \u223c 10\u22123 . (This is a typical distance for a woven three-braid of length L \u2243 46 which approximates\na desired operation - precise distances of approximate\nweaves are given in the figure captions.) As for all approximate weaves considered here, the Solovay-Kitaev algorithm outlined in Sec. V.C can be used to improve the\naccuracy of this weave so that \u01eb can be made as small as\nrequired with only a polylogarithmic increase in length.\nThe construction of a two-qubit gate using this effective braiding weave is also shown in Fig. 11. In this\nconstruction the control pair is woven through the top\ntwo quasiparticles of the target qubit using this weave.\nAs described above, if the control qubit is in the state\n|0L i, the control pair has q-spin 0 and the target qubit is\nunchanged. But, if the control qubit is in the state |1L i,\nthe control pair has q-spin 1 and the action on the target\nqubit is approximately equivalent to that of interchanging the top two quasiparticles twice, with the approximation becoming more accurate as the length of the effective\nbraiding weave is increased, either by deeper brute force\nsearching or by applying the Solovay-Kitaev algorithm.\n\n\f13\n\nFIG. 13: (color online). A weave which approximates iX (see\nEq. 12), and step two in our injection based construction. The\nbox labeled iX represents an ideal (infinite) iX weave which is\napproximated by the weave shown to a distance \u01eb = 8.5\u00d710\u22124\n(this is the same weave which appears at the top of Fig. 8).\nIn step two of our gate construction the control pair is woven\nwithin the injected target qubit, following this weave, in order\nto carry out an approximate iX gate when a = 1, as shown.\n\nBecause this effective braiding all occurs within an encoded qubit, leakage errors can be reduced to zero in\nthe limit \u01eb \u2192 0. The resulting two-qubit gate is then a\ncontrolled-\u03c322 gate which corresponds to controlled rotation of the target qubit through an angle of 6\u03c0/5.\nUnfortunately, due to the even m constraint, it is impossible to find an effective braiding gate which corresponds to a controlled \u03c0 rotation of the target qubit.\nSuch a gate would be equivalent to a controlled-NOT gate\nup to single-qubit rotations.43 Nonetheless, it is known\nthat any entangling two-qubit gate, when combined with\nthe ability to carry out arbitrary single-qubit rotations,\nforms a universal set of quantum gates.46 Thus, the efficient compilation of single-qubit operations described in\nSec. V and the effective braiding construction just given\nprovide direct procedures for compiling any quantum algorithm into a braid to any desired accuracy.\nAlthough it can be used to form a universal set of\ngates, this effective braiding construction is still rather\nrestrictive. It is clearly desirable to be able to directly\ncompile a controlled-NOT gate into a braid. We now\ngive a construction which can be used to efficiently compile any arbitrary controlled rotation of the target qubit\n- including a controlled-NOT gate. This construction\nis based on a class of woven three-braids which we call\n\"injection weaves\".\nIn an injection weave the weft quasiparticle again\nstarts at the top position but in this case ends at a different position. At the same time we require that the unitary operation generated by this weave approximate the\nidentity. Thus the effect of an injection weave is to permute the quasiparticles involved without changing any of\nthe underlying q-spin quantum numbers of the system.\nComparing the identity matrix to (10) we see that any\nthree-braid approximating the identity must have winding W = 0 (modulo 10). The fact that this winding\nmust be even implies that the final position of the weft\nparticle must be at the bottom of the weave. Thus injec-\n\nFIG. 14: (color online). An inverse injection weave and step\nthree in our injection based construction. The box labeled I \u22121\nrepresents an ideal (infinite) inverse injection weave which is\napproximated by the the inverse of the injection weave shown\nin Fig. 12, again to a distance \u01eb \u2243 1.5 \u00d7 10\u22123 . This weave\nis used to extract the control pair out of the injected target\nqubit and return it to the control qubit, as shown.\n\ntion weaves correspond to sequences {ni } which approximately satisfy the equation,\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n1 0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\u03c31 Uweave ({ni }) \u03c32 \u2243 \uf8ed 0 1 \uf8f8 .\n(14)\n1\n\nAn injection weave obtained through brute force search\nis shown in Fig. 12. The unitary operation produced\nby this weave approximates the identity operation to a\ndistance \u01eb \u223c 10\u22123 .\nOur two-qubit gate construction based on injection\nweaving is carried out in three steps. In the first step,\nalso shown in Fig. 12, the control pair is woven into the\ntarget qubit using the injection weave. If the control pair\nhas total q-spin 1 (the only nontrivial case) the effect of\nthis weave is merely to replace the middle quasiparticle\nof the target qubit with the control pair. Because the\nunitary operation approximated by the injection weave\nis the identity, in the \u01eb \u2192 0 limit this injection is accomplished without changing any of the q-spin quantum\nnumbers. The injected target qubit is therefore (approximately) in the same quantum state as the original target\nqubit.\nIn the second step of our construction, illustrated in\nFig. 13, we carry out an operation on the injected target qubit by simply weaving the control pair within the\ntarget. Because for a = 1 all of this weaving takes place\nwithin the injected target qubit, there will be no leakage\nerror (again, strictly speaking, only in the limit of an exact injection weave). The only constraint on this weave\nis that the control pair must both start and end in the\nmiddle position, and so it must have even winding.\nIf our goal is to produce a gate which is equivalent to\na controlled-NOT gate up to single-qubit rotations then\nwe must apply a \u03c0 rotation to the target qubit. Unfortunately, this cannot be accomplished by any finite weave\nwith even winding, so we must again consider approximate weaves.

Injection-weave based compilation of a controlled-NOT gate into a braid. A controlled-NOT gate can\nbe expressed as a controlled-(iX) gate and a single-qubit operation R(\u2212\u03c0/2 \u1e91) = exp(i\u03c0\u03c3z /4) acting on the control qubit.\nThe single-qubit rotation can be compiled following the procedure outlined in Sec. V, and the controlled-(iX) gate can be\ndecomposed into ideal injection (I), iX, and inverse injection (I \u22121 ) operations which can be similarly compiled. The full\napproximate controlled-(iX) braid obtained by replacing I, iX and I \u22121 with the weaves shown in the previous three figures is\nshown at bottom. The resulting gate approximates a controlled-(iX) to a distance \u01eb \u2243 1.8 \u00d7 10\u22123 and \u01eb \u2243 1.2 \u00d7 10\u22123 when the\ntotal q-spin of the two qubits is 0 or 1, respectively.\n\nwoven through the injected target qubit using a weave\nfound by a brute force search which approximates a particular \u03c0 rotation - the operator iX defined in (12) -\nto a distance \u01eb \u223c 10\u22123 (this is, in fact, the same weave\nshown at the top of Fig. 8).\nThe third step in our construction is the extraction of\nthe control pair from the target qubit. This is accomplished, as shown in Fig. 14, by applying the inverse of\nthe injection weave to the control pair. The effect of this\nextraction is to restore the control qubit to its original\nstate, and replace the control pair inside the target qubit\nwith the quasiparticle which originally occupied that position.\nThe full construction is summarized in Fig. 15, which\nprovides a recipe for compiling a controlled-NOT gate\ninto a two-quasiparticle weave. A quantum circuit\nshowing that a controlled-NOT gate is equivalent to\na controlled-(iX) gate and a single-qubit operation is\nshown in the top part of the figure. The single-qubit\noperation can be compiled to whatever accuracy is required following Sec. V, and the controlled-(iX) gate can\nbe decomposed into injection, iX, and inverse injection\noperations, as is also shown in the top part of the figure. These operations can then all be similarly compiled\nfollowing Sec. V.\nThe full braid shown at the bottom of Fig. 15 corresponds to using the approximate woven three-braids\nshown in Figs. 12-14 to carry out a controlled-(iX) gate.\nIn this braid, if the control qubit is in the state |0L i the\ncontrol pair has total q-spin 0 and the resulting unitary\ntransformation is exactly the identity. However, if the\ncontrol qubit is in the state |1L i the control pair has total q-spin 1 and behaves like a single Fibonacci anyon.\nThis pair is then woven into the target qubit using an injection weave, woven within the target in order to carry\nout the iX operation, and finally woven out of the target and back into the control qubit using the inverse of\nthe injection weave. The resulting gate is therefore a\n\ncontrolled-(iX) gate.\nBy replacing the iX weave with an even winding weave\nwhich carries out an arbitrary operation U this construction will give a controlled-U gate. The only restriction on\nU is that its overall phase must be consistent with (10)\nwith even winding W . However, this phase can be easily set to any desired value by applying the appropriate\nsingle-qubit rotation to the control qubit, as in Fig. 15.\nFinally, note that at no point in either the effective\nbraiding or injection weave constructions described above\ndid we make reference to the total q-spin of the two\nqubits involved. It follows that, in the limit of exact effective braiding or injection weaves, the action of the corresponding two-qubit gates on the computational qubit\nspace does not depend on the state of the external fusion\nspace associated with the q-spin 1 quantum numbers of\neach qubit (see Sec. IV). These gates will therefore not\nentangle the computational qubit space with this external fusion space.\n\nC.\n\nOne-Quasiparticle Weave Constructions\n\nWe now show that two-qubit gates can be carried out\nwith only a single mobile quasiparticle. This possibility follows from the general result of Ref. 41 that for\nany system of nonabelian quasiparticles in which general\nbraids are universal for quantum computation (such as\nFibonacci anyons), single quasiparticle weaves are universal as well. However, the \"proof of principle\" weaves\nconstructed in that work were extremely inefficient -\ninvolving a huge number of excess operations. Here we\nshow how to efficiently construct a single-quasiparticle\nweave corresponding to a controlled-NOT gate (up to\nsingle-qubit rotations).\nOur construction is based on a class of weaves which\nare similar to injection weaves in that they can be used to\nswap two q-spin 1 objects - where one object is a pair of\n\n\f15\nFibonacci anyons with total q-spin 1 and the other object\nis a single Fibonacci anyon - while acting effectively as\nthe identity operation so that none of the other q-spin\nquantum numbers of the system are disturbed. However, unlike injection weaves, this new class of weaves\naccomplish this swap without moving the pair as a single\nobject, and in fact can be carried out by moving just one\nquasiparticle.\nThe class of weaves we seek are those which approximate the transformation\nU ((\u2022, \u2022)a , \u2022)c = ei\u03c6 (\u2022, (\u2022, \u2022)a )c ,\n\n(15)\n\nwhere \u03c6 is an overall (irrelevant) phase which does not\ndepend on a or c. The relevant case for showing the\nsimilarity with injection is when a = 1, for which the\ninitial and final states in (15) consist of two q-spin 1 objects - a single Fibonacci anyon and a pair of Fibonacci\nanyons with total q-spin 1. If both these objects are\nrepresented as single Fibonacci anyons then (15) can be\nwritten U (\u2022, \u2022)c = ei\u03c6 (\u2022, \u2022)c . In this representation U\ntherefore acts effectively as the identity operation (times\nan irrelevant phase), similar to injection.\nUsing the F matrix (5) to expand the right hand side\nof (15) in the ((\u2022, \u2022), \u2022) basis yields\nX\nc\nU ((\u2022, \u2022)a , \u2022)c = ei\u03c6\nFab\n((\u2022, \u2022)b , \u2022)c .\n(16)\nb\n\nComparing this with the action of a unitary operation U\nwith matrix representation\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n1\n1\nU00\nU01\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec 1\n1\nU = \uf8ed U10\n(17)\nU11\n\uf8f8,\n0\nU11\n\non the state ((\u2022, \u2022)a , \u2022)c ,\n\nU ((\u2022, \u2022)a , \u2022)c =\n\nX\nb\n\nc\nUab\n((\u2022, \u2022)b , \u2022)c ,\n\n(18)\n\nwe see that the matrix representation of the U we seek\nis precisely the F matrix (up to a phase): U = ei\u03c6 F .\nWhile the F matrix describes a \"passive\" operation, i.e.\na change of basis, the operator U can be viewed as an\n\"active\" F operation which acts directly on the states of\nthe Hilbert space. Note that, since F = F \u22121 , we also\nhave\nU (\u2022, (\u2022, \u2022)a )c = ei\u03c6 ((\u2022, \u2022)a , \u2022)c .\n\n(19)\n\nWe will refer to weaves which approximate the operation (15) (and thus also (19)) as F weaves. As we have\nseen, the unitary operation U produced by an F weave\nneed only approximate the F matrix (5) up to an overall\nirrelevant phase. To be consistent with (10) this phase\nmust be \u22121, as can be seen by writing the matrix \u2212F as\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\u221a !\n\u00b1i\u03c4 \u00b1i \u03c4\n\u221a\n\uf8ec \u00b1i\n\uf8f7\n\u2212F =\uf8ed\n(20)\n\u00b1i \u03c4 \u2213i\u03c4\n\uf8f8,\n\u22121\n\nFIG. 16: (color online). An F weave, and step one of our F\nweave based two-qubit gate construction. The box labeled F\nrepresents an ideal (infinite) F weave which is approximated\nby the weave shown to a distance \u01eb \u2243 3.1\u00d710\u22123 . Applying the\nF weave to the initial two-qubit state, as shown, produces an\nintermediate state with q-spins labeled a and b\u2032 which depend\nsimply on a and b - the initial states of the two qubits (see\nTable I).\n\nwhere a factor of \u00b1i has been pulled out of the upper left\n2\u00d72 block, leaving an SU (2) matrix (det = \u03c4 2 + \u03c4 = 1).\nComparing (20) with (10), it is also evident that any F\nweave must have winding W = 5 (modulo 10), which is\nnecessarily odd.\nThe fact that F weaves must have an odd number of\nwindings implies that if the weft quasiparticle starts at\nthe top position of the weave it must end at the middle\nposition. For this choice the F weave must then approximately satisfy the equation\nUweave ({ni }) \u03c32 \u2243 \u2212F.\n\n(21)\n\nThe result of a brute force search for an F weave which\napproximates the operation \u2212F to a distance \u01eb \u223c 10\u22123\nis shown in Fig. 16.\nThe first step in our single-quasparticle weave construction is the application of an F weave to two qubits,\nalso shown in Fig. 16. Note that in this figure for convenience we have made a change of basis on the bottom qubit, so that the pair which determines its state\n(the control pair) consists of the top two quasiparticles\nwithin it rather than the bottom two. There is no loss\nof generality in doing so since this just corresponds to a\nsingle-qubit rotation on the bottom qubit.\nWith this basis choice the initial state of the two qubits\nis determined by the q-spins of their respective control\npairs which are indicated in Fig. 16 as a (top qubit) and\nb (bottom qubit). After carrying out the F weave, taking the middle quasiparticle of the top qubit as the weft\nquasiparticle and weaving it around both the bottom\nquasiparticle of the top qubit and the top quasiparticle\nof the bottom qubit, the resulting state (again, strictly\nspeaking, only in the limit of an exact F weave) is shown\nat the end of the two-qubit weave in Fig. 16. From (19) it\nfollows that the newly positioned weft quasiparticle and\nthe quasiparticle beneath will have total q-spin a. When\nthe quasiparticle beneath these two is also included, the\nthree quasiparticles form what we will refer to as the intermediate state, (\u2022, (\u2022, \u2022)a )b\u2032 , where the total q-spin of\n\n\f16\n\u0010\u0014\n\n)\n\nFIG. 17: (color online).

The box labeled P represents an ideal (infinite) \u03b1 = \u03c0\nphase weave which is approximated by the weave shown to a\ndistance \u01eb \u2243 1.9 \u00d7 10\u22123 . Applying this phase weave to the\nintermediate state created by the F weave, as shown, results\nin a b\u2032 dependent \u03c0 phase shift (see Table I with \u03b1 = \u03c0).\n\nall three quasiparticles, b\u2032 , has a well-defined value provided a and b are well defined, as we now show.\nFirst consider the case a = 1. As described above, the\neffect of the F weave is then similar to that of the injection weave from the previous construction - it replaces\nthe topmost quasiparticle in the bottom qubit with a pair\nof quasiparticles with q-spin 1, and the bottommost pair\nof quasiparticles in the top qubit (which also has total\nq-spin 1) with a single quasiparticle, without changing\nany of the other q-spin quantum numbers of the system.\nIn the limit of an ideal F weave, this means that the b\nquantum number does not change after this swap and\nso b\u2032 = b. The case a = 0 is simpler, since in this case\nthe intermediate state is (\u2022, (\u2022, \u2022)0 )b\u2032 for which the fusion\nrules (2) imply b\u2032 = 1, regardless of the value of b. The\nresulting dependence of b\u2032 on a and b is summarized in\nTable I.\nHaving used the F weave to create the intermediate\nstate (\u2022, (\u2022, \u2022)a )b\u2032 , the next step in our construction is the\napplication of a weave which performs an operation on\nthis state which does not change a and b\u2032 but which does\nyield an a and b\u2032 dependent phase factor.

The box labeled F \u22121 is an\nideal (infinite) inverse F weave which is approximated by the\ninverse of the F weave shown in Fig. 16, again to a distance\n\u01eb \u2243 3.1 \u00d7 10\u22123 . By applying the inverse F weave to the state\nobtained after applying the phase weave, as shown, the two\nqubits are returned to their initial states, but now with an a\nand b dependent phase factor (see Table I).\n\nquasiparticle both start and end in the top position so\nthat when we join it to the F weave and its inverse there\nwill be a single weft quasiparticle throughout the entire\ngate construction. The phase weave must therefore have\neven winding, and with no loss of generality we can consider the case for which the winding satisfies W = 0\n(modulo 10). The unitary operation produced by such a\nphase weave must then approximately satisfy the equation\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nei\u03b1 0\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\u03c32 Uweave ({ni })\u03c32 \u2243 F \uf8ed 0 e\u2212i\u03b1 \uf8f8 F \u22121 , (22)\n1\n\nwhere the F matrices are needed to change the Hilbert\nspace basis from that in which the operation produced by\nthe phase braid must be diagonal, (the (\u2022, (\u2022, \u2022)) basis),\nto that in which the \u03c31 and \u03c32 matrices are defined, (the\n((\u2022, \u2022), \u2022) basis).\nWe will see that a phase weave with \u03b1 = \u03c0 produces a\ntwo-qubit gate which is equivalent to a controlled-NOT\ngate up to single-qubit rotations. The result of a brute\nforce search for such a phase weave which approximates\nthe desired operation to a distance \u01eb \u223c 10\u22123 is shown in\nFig. 17. This figure also shows the action of the phase\nweave on the intermediate state produced in Fig. 16. In\nthis weave, the weft quasiparticle is now woven through\nthe two quasiparticles beneath it, and returns to its original position. Because the phase weave produces a diagonal operation in the basis shown for the intermediate\nstate, it does not change the values of a and b\u2032 . Its only\neffect is to give a phase factor of ei\u03b1 to the state with\na = 0 (which necessarily has b\u2032 = 1) and e\u2212i\u03b1 to the\nstate with a = 1 and b\u2032 = 1. The state with a = 1 and\nb\u2032 = 0 is unchanged. These phase factors are also shown\nin Table I.\nThe final step in this construction is to perform the inverse of the F weave to return the two qubits to their original states.

F weave based compilation of a controlled-NOT gate into a braid. A controlled-NOT gate is equivalent\nto a controlled-(\u2212Z) gate with the single-qubit operation R(\u03c0/2 \u0177) = exp(\u2212i\u03c0\u03c3y /4) and its inverse applied to the target qubit\nbefore and after the controlled-(\u2212Z). Again, the single-qubit operations can be trivially compiled, and the controlled-(\u2212Z)\ngate decomposed into ideal F , phase (P ), and inverse F (F \u22121 ) weaves which can be similarly compiled. The full approximate\ncontrolled-(\u2212Z) weave obtained by replacing F , P and F \u22121 with the approximate weaves shown in the previous three figures\nis shown at bottom. The resulting gate approximates a controlled-(\u2212Z) to a distance \u01eb \u2243 4.9 \u00d7 10\u22123 and \u01eb \u2243 3.2 \u00d7 10\u22123 when\nthe total q-spin of the two qubits is 0 or 1, respectively.\n\nF and phase weaves, the resulting operation on the computational qubit space in the basis ab = {00, 01, 10, 11}\nis then,\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nei\u03b1 0 0 0\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec 0 ei\u03b1 0 0 \uf8f7\nU =\uf8ec\n(23)\n\uf8f7.\n\uf8ed 0 0 1 0 \uf8f8\n0 0 0 e\u2212i\u03b1\n\nIf we take the top qubit to be the control qubit, and the\nbottom qubit to be the target qubit, then this gate corresponds, up to an irrelevant overall phase, to a controlled(e\u2212i3\u03b1/2 ei\u03b1\u03c3z /2 ) operation. For the case \u03b1 = \u03c0 this is a\ncontrolled-(\u2212Z) gate (where Z = \u03c3z ), i.e. a controlledPhase gate, which, up to single-qubit rotations, is equivalent to a controlled-NOT gate.\nThe full F weave based gate construction is summarized in Fig. 19. A quantum circuit showing a controlledNOT gate in terms of a controlled-(\u2212Z) gate and two\nsingle-qubit operations is shown in the top part of the\nfigure. As in our injection based construction, the singlequbit operations can be compiled to whatever accuracy\nis required following the procedure outlined in Sec. V.\nThe controlled-(\u2212Z) gate can then be decomposed into\nideal F , phase, and inverse F weaves as is also shown\nin the top part of the figure. Woven three-braids which\napproximate these operations can then be compiled to\nwhatever accuracy is required, again following Sec. V.\nThe full controlled-(\u2212Z) weave corresponding to using\nthe approximate F and phase weaves shown in Figs. 1618 is shown in the bottom part of the figure.\nFinally, in this construction, as for the constructions\ndescribed in Sec. VI.B, we at no point made reference\nto the total q-spin of the two qubits involved. Thus,\nin the limit of exact F and phase weaves, the action of\nthe two-qubit gates constructed here will not entangle\nthe computational qubit space with the external fusion\nspace associated with the q-spin 1 quantum numbers of\neach qubit.\n\nVII.\n\nWHAT'S SPECIAL ABOUT k = 3?\n\nAll of the gate constructions discussed in this paper\nexploit the fact that the braiding and fusion properties\nof a pair of Fibonacci anyons are either trivial if their total q-spin is 0, or equivalent to those of a single Fibonacci\nanyon if their total q-spin is 1. The fact that these are\nthe only two possibilities is a special property of the Fibonacci anyon model, and hence also the SU (2)3 model,\ngiven their effective equivalence. It is then natural to\nask to what extent our constructions can be generalized\nto SU (2)k CSW theories for different values of the level\nparameter k.\nOf course we know from the results of Freedman et\nal.6 that the SU (2)k representations of the braid group\nare dense for k = 3 and k > 4. Thus, for example,\nbraids which approximate controlled-NOT gates on encoded qubits exist and can, in principle, be found for all\nthese k values. However, we will show below that things\nare somewhat simpler for the case k = 3. Specifically\nwe will show that for k = 3, and only k = 3, it is possible to carry out two-qubit entangling gates by braiding\nonly four quasiparticles, as, for example, in our effective\nbraiding and F weave constructions.\nConsider a pair of SU (2)k four-quasiparticle qubits as\nshown in Fig. 20. Here each quasiparticle is assumed\nto have q-spin 1/2 and the total q-spin of each qubit is\nrequired to be 0. The state of a given qubit is then determined by the q-spin of either the topmost or bottommost\npair of quasiparticles within it, where, from the SU (2)k\nfusion rules (1), the q-spin of each pair must be the same\nfor the total q-spin of the qubit to be 0. Thus, in Fig. 20,\nthe state of the top qubit is determined by the q-spin labeled a and the state of the bottom qubit is determined\nby the q-spin labeled b, where, again from the fusion rules\n(1), a and b can be either 0 or 1.\nIf we are only allowed to braid the middle four quasiparticles, as shown in Fig. 20, then the total q-spin of\nthe two topmost quasiparticles of the top qubit and the\n\n\f18\n\u0013\n\n\u0013\nD\nD\n\nD\nD\n\n\u00ab\nG E\n\nE\n\nE\n\nE\n\n\u0013\n\nG\n\n\u0013\n\nFIG. 20: (color online). Two four-quasiparticle qubits and a\nbraiding pattern in which only two quasiparticles from each\nqubit are braided. Here the quasiparticles are SU (2)k excitations with q-spin 1/2. The state of the top qubit is determined\nby the total q-spin of the quasiparticle pairs labeled a and the\nstate of the bottom qubit is determined by the total q-spin\nof the quasiparticle pairs labeled b. The overall q-spin of the\nfour braided quasiparticles is d, (a dashed oval is used because\nwhen a = b = 1 these quasiparticles will not be in a q-spin\neigenstate). For this braid to produce no leakage errors, the\nunitary operation it generates must be diagonal in a and b,\nthough it can, of course, result in an a and b dependent phase\nfactor. For k > 3, d can take the values 0, 1 or 2, while for\nk = 3 the only allowed values for d are 0 and 1. The existence of the d = 2 state for k > 3 makes it impossible to\ncarry out an entangling two-qubit gate by braiding only four\nquasiparticles (see text).\n\ntwo bottommost quasiparticles of the bottom qubit will\nremain, respectively, a and b. It follows that if the two\nqubits are to remain in their computational qubit spaces,\nthe total q-spin of the two topmost and two bottommost\nquasiparticles that are being braided must also remain,\nrespectively, a and b. (If this were not the case, the fusion rules (1) would imply that the total q-spin of the\nfour quasiparticles forming each qubit would no longer\nbe 0). Thus, in order for there to be no leakage errors\nafter braiding these four quasiparticles, the resulting operation must be diagonal in a and b.\nIt is important to note that this result, and the results\nthat follow, hold not just for four-quasiparticle qubits,\nbut also for SU (2)k versions of the three-quasiparticle\nqubits used throughout this paper. This is because, as\npointed out in Sec. IV, any gate acting on a pair of threequasiparticle qubits must result in an operation on the\ncomputational qubit space which is independent of the\nstate of the external fusion space associated with the fact\nthat each qubit has total q-spin 1/2, (here the total q-spin\nof a three-quasiparticle qubit is 1/2 rather than 1 because\nwe are using SU (2)k quantum numbers and assuming\neach quasiparticle has q-spin 1/2 - see Fig. 3(b)). It\nis therefore sufficient to consider the special case when\nthe state of two three-quasiparticle qubits corresponds to\nthat of the two four-quasiparticle qubits shown in Fig. 20,\nbut with the topmost and bottommost quasiparticles removed. The above arguments then imply any leakage free\noperation produced by braiding the four middle quasipar-\n\nticles must be diagonal in a and b.\nNow consider the four middle quasiparticles we are allowed to braid. A basis for the Hilbert space of these\nquasiparticles can be taken to be one labeled by the qspin quantum numbers a and b, as well as the total q-spin\nof all four quasiparticles which we denote d (see Fig. 20).\nFor k > 3 the fusion rules (1) imply this total q-spin d can\nbe equal to 0, 1 or 2, while for k = 3 it can only be equal\nto 0 or 1. We will see that this truncation of the d = 2\nstate is the crucial property of the k = 3 theory which\nmakes our F weave and effective braiding constructions\npossible.\nIt is convenient at this stage to restrict ourselves to\nbraids with zero total winding (i.e. equal numbers of\nclockwise and counterclockwise exchanges). For such\nbraids, arguments similar to those used to derive (10)\ncan be used to show the unitary operation enacted on\nthe d = 0, 1 and 2 sectors must each have determinant 1.\nThere is no loss of generality in restricting ourselves to\nsuch braids, since a braid with arbitrary winding can always be turned into one with zero winding by adding the\nappropriate number of interchanges to either the two topmost or two bottommost of the braiding quasiparticles\nat either the beginning or end of the braid. These added\ninterchanges will all be within encoded qubits and so correspond to single-qubit rotations which will not produce\nany entanglement between the two qubits.\nIf we restrict ourselves to braids with zero winding and\ninsist that these braids approximate gates with zero leakage error - which, as shown above, implies the gate must\nbe diagonal in the a and b quantum numbers - then in\nthe abd = {000, 110, 011, 101, 111, 112} basis the unitary\ntransformation acting on the Hilbert space of the four\nbraiding quasiparticles must have the form\nei\u03b1 0\n\uf8ec 0 e\u2212i\u03b1\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\nei\u03b2 0\n0\n\uf8ec\nU =\uf8ec\ni\u03b3\n\uf8ec\n0 e\n0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n0 0 e\u2212i(\u03b2+\u03b3)\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n1\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7,\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n(24)\n\nwhere we have required that the d = 0, 1 and 2 blocks\nall have determinant 1, (in particular, the d = 2 block is\nsimply 1).\nNote that the case a = b = 1 has three entries in this\nmatrix, corresponding to the three possible values for the\ntotal q-spin quantum number d. For this gate to produce\nno leakage error, the phase factors in all three of these\nsectors must be the same. To see this note that one can\nexpand the relevant eight-quasiparticle state in terms of\nbasis states with well-defined values of d as follows\n(((\u2022, \u2022)1 , (\u2022, \u2022)1 )0 , ((\u2022, \u2022)1 , (\u2022, \u2022)1 )0 )0\n2\nX\n=\nFd ((\u2022, \u2022)1 , ((\u2022, \u2022)1 , (\u2022, \u2022)1 )d , (\u2022, \u2022)1 )0 ,(25)\nd=0\n\n\f19\nwhere standard quantum group methods28,33 can be used\nto compute the coefficients Fd , with the result\np\np\n[3]q\n[5]q\n1\n, F1 =\n, F2 =\n.\n(26)\nF0 =\n[3]q\n[3]q\n[3]q\nHere we have introduced the q-integers [m]q \u2261 (q m/2 \u2212\nq \u2212m/2 )/(q 1/2 \u2212 q \u22121/2 ), where q = ei2\u03c0/(k+2) is the deformation parameter.\nFor k > 3 all three Fd coefficients are nonzero. Thus,\nin order for the action of (24) on the a = b = 1 state to\nproduce the same state back (up to a phase), the projection of this state in the three d sectors must all acquire\nthe same phase. This implies that \u03b1 = 0 and \u03b2 = \u2212\u03b3.\nThe resulting unitary operation must therefore take the\nform\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n1 0\n\uf8ec0 1\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\ni\u03b2\ne\n0 0 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec\nU =\uf8ec\n(27)\n\uf8f7,\n\uf8ec\n0 e\u2212i\u03b2 0 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ed\n0\n0 1 \uf8f8\n1\n\nwhich corresponds to the following two-qubit gate in the\nab = {00, 01, 10, 11} basis,\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n1 0\n0 0\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec 0 ei\u03b2 0 0 \uf8f7\ngate\n(28)\nUk>3\n=\uf8ec\n\uf8f7.\n\uf8ed 0 0 e\u2212i\u03b2 0 \uf8f8\n0 0\n0 1\n\nThis gate is simply the tensor product of two single-qubit\n(1)\n(2)\ngate\nrotations, Uk>3\n= e\u2212i\u03b2\u03c3z /2 \u2297ei\u03b2\u03c3z /2 . Thus we see that\nfor k > 3 any two-qubit gate constructed by braiding only\nfour quasiparticles for which there is no leakage error\nmust necessarily also produce no entanglement.\nFor k = 3 this argument breaks down because the d =\n2 sector of the braiding quasiparticles is not present. In\nthis case, following the same argument as above, in the\nabd = {000, 110, 011, 101, 111} basis the allowed leakage\nfree unitary transformations which can be produced by\nbraiding the four middle quasiparticles must be of the\nform (again taking the case of zero winding),\n\uf8eb i\u03b1\n\uf8f6\ne\n0\n\uf8ec 0 e\u2212i\u03b1\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\nU =\uf8ec\n(29)\nei\u03b2\n0\n0 \uf8f7,\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\ni(\u03b1\u2212\u03b2)\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\n0 e\n0\n0\n0\ne\u2212i\u03b1\nwhich corresponds to the following two-qubit gate in the\nab = {00, 01, 10, 11} basis,\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nei\u03b1 0\n0\n0\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n0\n0 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec 0 ei\u03b2\ngate\n(30)\nUk=3\n=\uf8ec\n\uf8f7.\n\uf8ed 0 0 ei(\u03b1\u2212\u03b2) 0 \uf8f8\n0 0\n0\ne\u2212i\u03b1\n\ngate\ngate\nAs for Uk>3\n, the \u03b2 dependence of Uk=3\ncorresponds to\na tensor product of single-qubit rotations. Gates of this\nform with fixed \u03b1 but different values of \u03b2 are thus equivalent up to single-qubit rotations. If we use this equivgate\nalence to set \u03b2 = \u03b1 we see that gates of the form Uk=3\nare equivalent to the gates produced by our F weave\nconstruction (23), and so, in particular, when \u03b1 = \u03c0 the\nresulting gate is equivalent to a controlled-NOT gate.\n\nVIII.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nTo summarize, we have shown how to construct both\nsingle-qubit and two-qubit gates for qubits encoded using nonabelian quasiparticles described by SU (2)3 CSW\ntheory, or, equivalently, the SO(3)3 theory (Fibonacci\nanyons). Qubits are encoded into triplets of quasiparticles and single-qubit gates are carried out by braiding\nquasiparticles within qubits. Two classes of two-qubit\ngate constructions were presented. In the first, a pair\nof quasiparticles from one qubit is woven through those\nforming the second qubit. In the second, a single quasiparticle is woven through three static quasiparticles (one\nfrom the same qubit as the mobile quasiparticle, the other\ntwo from the second qubit). A central theme in all of our\ntwo-qubit gate constructions is that of breaking the problem of compiling braids for the six quasiparticles used to\nencode two qubits into a series of braids involving only\nthree objects at a time. While these constructions do not\nin general produce the optimal braid of a given length\nwhich approximates a desired two-qubit gate, we believe\nthey do lead to the most accurate (or at least among the\nmost accurate) two-qubit gates which can be obtained for\na fixed amount of classical computing power. Finally, we\nproved a theorem which states that for the SU (2)k CSW\ntheory, two-qubit gates constructed by braiding only four\nquasiparticles (two from each qubit) can only lead to\nleakage free entangling two-qubit gates when k = 3.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nL.H. and N.E.B. acknowledge support from the US\nD.O.E. through Grant No. DE-FG02-97ER45639, and\nG.Z. acknowledges support from the NHMFL at Florida\nState University.
