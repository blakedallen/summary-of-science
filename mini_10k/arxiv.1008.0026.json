An example is the antiferromagnetic XY\nspin system on the two-dimensional (2D) triangular lattice [3]. Another realization is a Josephson junction array\n(JJA) on the square lattice under an external magnetic\nfield such that the flux density per plaquette is f = 1/2\n[4, 5]. These systems possess an Ising-like Z2 symmetry\nwith respect to global spin reflections in spin space and\na continuous U (1) symmetry with respect to global spin\nrotations in spin space.\nThe ground state of the model is characterized by the\nopposite sense of the chirality. The chirality is an Isinglike variable taking either plus or minus corresponding\nto the right- and left-handed noncollinear spin structure\n[1]. More precisely, in the ground state of the model, the\nchirality exhibits a checker-board-like pattern much as in\nthe antiferromagnetic Ising model on the square lattice.\nSince the chirality changes its sign with respect to global\nspin reflections in spin space, the Z2 spin-reflection symmetry is broken in the ground state of the model. Then,\nby an analogy to the 2D Ising model, it would be natural\nto expect that the ordering of the chirality takes place at\na finite critical temperature Tc . Concerning the continuous U (1) spin symmetry, although the Mermin-Wagner\ntheorem inhibits the onset of a true spin long-range order at any finite temperature [6], a finite-temperature\ntransition into a quasi-long-range-ordered state like the\nKosterlitz-Thouless (KT) transition [7] is still expected\nto occur.\nA central issue in the studies of the FFXY model, since\nthe seminal work by Teitel and Jayaprakash [2], has been\nto clarify how these two distinct types of orderings take\nplace. An interesting possibility among others, which\nhas attracted researchers for decades, is that even at the\ntemperature where the chirality establishes a long-range\n\norder the spin (superconducting phase in case of the\nJJA) may remain disordered due to thermally excited,\nunbound vortices. Then, the orderings of the chirality\nand of the spin take place at two separate temperatures\nT = Tc and T = Ts such that Tc > Ts . We emphasize\nthat the possibility of such a \"spin-chirality decoupling\"\nis a basic general problem in the studies of frustrated\nmagnets including spin glasses [8]. The universality of\nthe two transitions is also an interesting issue. However,\nthe separation between Tc and Ts in the present system is\nextremely small, if any, which makes the solution of this\nproblem technically difficult in spite of intensive studies\ndone for more than two decades [9\u201335].\nUnder such circumstances, the purpose of the present\npaper is to clarify the nature of the phase transitions\nof the 2D FFXY model by performing extensive Monte\nCarlo (MC) simulations for systems as large as up to\nL \u223c O(103 ). As was recently suggested by Hasenbusch,\nPelissetto and Vicari (HPV) [21, 22], such large system\nsizes are needed to extract asymptotic crucial properties of the system. Although our system size is comparable to Hsenbusch et al , we study various physical quantities including those which were not studied in\nRefs.[21, 22]. Namely, in addition to the Binder parameters, the correlation lengths and the helicity modulus\nstudied in Refs.[21, 22], we also investigate the specific\nheat, the chiral susceptibility and the vorticity modulus [36, 37] in order to shed further light on the ordering of the model. Furthermore, Refs.[21, 22] restricted\ntheir study just to the transition point, whereas we study\nan explicit temperature dependence of various physical\nquantities in a finite temperature range around the transition point(s).\nThen, we have found convincing evidence that the two\nphase transitions take place at mutually close but two\ndistinct temperatures. We have also found that the critical properties of the chiral transition are well compatible with the Ising universality class. We corroborate\n\n\f2\nRefs.[21, 22] in these conclusions. On the other hand,\nwe have found that the universality of the spin transition is not compatible with the standard KT transition,\na conclusion different from that of Refs.[21, 22].\nThe organization of the paper is as follows. In the\nnext section, we introduce our model and explain the\nmethod of our simulations together with various physical\nobservables we calculate. In sec. III, we present and\ndiscuss the results of our MC simulation. Finally in sec.\nIV, we conclude with a summary and some additional\ndiscussions. In appendix A, some details of the coulombgas representation of the vorticity modulus are given.\n\nII.\n\nand the chiral correlation length,\ns\nh|mc (~0)|2 i\n1\n\u03bec =\n\u2212 1,\n2 sin(\u03c0/L) h|mc (~qmin )|2 i\n\nMODEL AND METHOD\n\nH =\u2212\n\nX\n\nhi,ji\n\n~i * S\n~j ,\nJij S\n\nChirality-related observables\n\nLet us introduce first physical observables associated\nwith the chirality. We define the local chirality at a plaquette n by,\n1 X\nsign(Jij ) sin(\u03b8i \u2212 \u03b8j ),\n\u03ban = \u221a\n2 2\n\n(2)\n\nwhere the sum is taken over the four bonds around the\nplaquette. The normalization factor is chosen such that\nthe absolute value of the chirality becomes unity in the\nground state. The checker-board-like order of the chirality can be detected though a 'staggered-chirality',\nmc =\n\nN\n1 X\n(\u22121)xn +yn \u03ban .\nN n=1\n\n(3)\n\nN\n1 X\n(\u22121)xn +yn ei~q*~rn \u03ban .\nN n=1\n\n(6)\n\nis the Fourier transform of the staggered-chirality where\nex and ~rn = (xn , yn ).\n~qmin = 2\u03c0\nL~\nIn addition, we examine the staggered chiral susceptibility defined by,\n\u03c7c = N \u03b2hm2c i,\n\n(7)\n\nwhere \u03b2 is the inverse temperature.\n\n(1)\n\n~i = (S x , S y ) = (cos \u03b8i , sin \u03b8i ) (0 \u2264 \u03b8i < 2\u03c0) is\nwhere S\ni\ni\nthe two-component spin variable at the site i. The summation hiji is taken over all nearest-neighboring sites.\nThe interaction bond takes two possible values Jij = \u00b1J\nsuch that every plaquette on the square lattice is frustrated\nQ , i.e., the product of Jij around each plaquette\nis\nsign(Jij ) = \u22121. In the following, we measure the\n(reduced) temperature kB T /J in a unit with kB /J = 1.\nWe denote the thermal averages as h. . .i.\n\n(5)\n\nwhere\nmc (~q) =\n\nWe study the fully frustrated XY (FFXY) model on\na square lattice of size N = L \u00d7 L. We label the sites of\nthe square lattice as i = 1, 2, . . . , N and denote their x\nand y-coordinates as xi = 1, 2, . . . , L and yi = 1, 2, . . . , L.\nSimilarly, we label the plaquettes as n = 1, 2, . . . , N and\ndenote their coordinates as xn = 1, 2, . . . , L and yn =\n1, 2, . . . , L.\nThe Hamiltonian of the model is given by,\n\nA.\n\nWe study the onset of the chiral order via the chiral\nBinder parameter,\n\u0012\n\u0013\nhm4c i\n3\n1\u2212\n,\n(4)\ngc =\n2\n2hm2c i2\n\nB.\n\nSpin-related observables\n\nNext, we introduce the physical quantities associated\nwith the spin. The spin order parameter is defined via\nthe sublattice magnetization. The square lattice is decomposed into four sublattices, and the sublattice magnetization is defined by,\nms,\u03b1 =\n\n1\nN/4\n\nX\n\n~i ,\nS\n\n(8)\n\ni\u2208sublattice \u03b1\n\nwhere \u03b1 = 1, 2, 3, 4 denotes each sublattice.\nIn 2D, the spin order parameter should vanish in the\nthermodynamic limit N \u2192 \u221e at any finite temperature.\nHowever, the spin may still establish a quasi-long-range\norder below a finite transition temperature Ts . To detect\nsuch a spin order, we measure the spin Binder parameter,\n!\n4\nhm4s,\u03b1 i\n1X\ngs =\n2\u2212\n,\n(9)\n4 \u03b1=1\nhm2s,\u03b1 i2\nand the spin correlation length,\ns\n4\nhms,\u03b1 (~0)2 i\n1X\n1\n\u03bes =\n\u2212 1,\n4 \u03b1=1 2 sin(\u03c0/L) hms,\u03b1 (~qmin )2 i\n\n(10)\n\nwhere\nms,\u03b1 (~q) =\n\n1\nN/4\n\nX\n\ni\u2208sublattice \u03b1\n\n~i ,\nei~q*r~i S\n\n(11)\n\n\f3\nand ~qmin = (2\u03c0/L, 0). We also calculate the sublattice\nspin susceptibility defined by,\n\u03c7s = N\n\n4\nX\n\n\u03b1=1\n\n\u03b2hm2s,\u03b1 i.\n\n(12)\n\nIn addition, we study the helicity modulus and the\nvorticity modulus which detect the rigidity of the system\nagainst appropriate spin deformations. The two quantities are related but have physically different meanings as\nexplained below.\nThe helicity modulus \u03a5 measures the rigidity of the\nsystem against an infinitesimal uniform twist of the spins\n\u2206\u03b8 applied on the boundary. More precisely, it is defined\nthrough the change of the total free energy \u2206F with respect to an infinitesimal twist on the spin configuration\nalong, say, y-axis \u03b8i \u2212 \u03b8i\u2032 \u2192 \u03b8i \u2212 \u03b8i\u2032 + (\u2206\u03b8/L) where i\u2032 is\nthe nearest neighbour site of site i along the +y direction.\nOne readily finds,\n\u2206F = \u03a5(\u2206\u03b8)2 + O(\u22064 ).\n\n(13)\n\nThe helicity modulus is then given by,\n+\n\"*\nX\n1\nJii\u2032 cos(\u03b8i \u2212 \u03b8i\u2032 )\n\u03a5=\nN\ni\n+2 \uf8f9\n*\nX\nJii\u2032 sin(\u03b8i \u2212 \u03b8i\u2032 ) \uf8fb .\n\u2212\u03b2\n\nv1 (T, L) =\n\n(14)\n\nOn the other hand, the vorticity modulus [36, 37] measures the rigidity of the system against a creation of an\nextra vortex. Disregarding the discrete nature of the vorticity, we consider an infinitesimal increase of the vorticity represented by the phase differences \u03b8i \u2212 \u03b8j \u2192\n\u03b8i \u2212 \u03b8j + m\u03c6ij across each bond < ij > where m is assumed to be small. Here \u03c6ij = \u2212\u03c6ji is the solid angle\nbetween site i and j with respect to an arbitrarily chosen origin in the system where the core of the vortex is\nsupposed to be located. p\nIn practice, we define the solid\nangle as \u03c6ij = \u00eaij * \u03c6\u0302ij / x2i + yi2 . Here \u00eaij is the unit\nvector connecting the neighboring sites i and j, and \u03c6\u0302ij\nis a unit vector tangential to the circular path passing\nthrough the site i enclosing the origin. One readily finds\nthat the free-energy increase can be expressed as,\n\nv2 (T, L1 , L2 ) =\n\nV =\n\n<i,j>\n\n\u2212\u03b2\n\n*\n\n+\n\nJij \u03c62ij cos(\u03b8i \u2212 \u03b8j )\n\nX\n\n<i,j>\n\nV (T, L1 ) \u2212 V (T, L2 )\n,\nln(L1 /L2 )\n\n(19)\n\nand examine its L1 , L2 \u2192 \u221e limit. The advantage of v2\ncompared with the first one v1 (T ) is that the anticipated\nconstant term c(T ) in Eq. (17) is cancelled so that a\nfinite-size correction becomes smaller.\n\nMonte Calro simulations\n\nWe use a Monte Calro method which combines the\nMetropolis method and the over-relation method [38].\nWithin a single Monte Carlo Step (MCS), the spins\nare updated by one sweep using the Metropolis method\nwhich is followed by three consecutive over-relaxation\nsweeps. System sizes of L = 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024\nplus L = 384, 768 under periodic boundary conditions\nare studied. We use the histogram method to evaluate\nphysical quantities around the critical temperature. Typical MC steps used for equilibration and measurements\nare 108 MCS for L = 512, 768, 1024 around the chiral\ntransition temperature and 5 \u00d7 106 MCS around the spin\ntransition temperature.\n\nIII.\n\nRESULTS\n\nIn this section, we present the results of our MC simulations.\n\nA.\n\nX\n\n(18)\n\n(15)\n\nwith\n*\n\nV (T, L)\n,\nln L\n\nand examine its L \u2192 \u221e limit. The second way is to\ndefine the effective vorticity modulus using the data at\ntwo different system sizes L1 and L2 [37],\n\nC.\n\ni\n\n\u2206F = V m2 + O(m4 ),\n\nwhere v(T ) is the vorticity modulus. In appendix A,\nwe present a coulomb-gas representation of the vorticity modulus which might provide some insight into the\nphysical meaning of this quantity.\nIn practice, we evaluate the vorticity modulus v(T ) in\ntwo different ways. The first way is to define the effective\nvorticity modulus by,\n\n+2\n\nJij \u03c6ij sin(\u03b8i \u2212 \u03b8j )\n\n.\n\n(16)\n\nFor large enough systems, we expect the scaling behaviour,\nV (T, L) \u2248 c(T ) + v(T ) ln L,\n\n(17)\n\nSpecific heat\n\nWe begin with the specific heat C = \u03b2 2 (hH 2 i \u2212 hHi2 ).\nAs shown in Fig. 1(a), the specific heat exhibits a sharp\npeak as a function of the temperature at T = Tpeak (L).\nThe height of the peak increases with increasing L, suggesting the occurrence of a second-order phase transition.\nMeanwhile, there is no indication of other phase transitions. This could be explained if one recalls that the\nexpected spin transition might be of the KT-type which\nis known not to accompany a distinct anomaly in the\n\n\f4\n\na)\n\n8\n\nT\n\n7.5\n\n140\n\nL=256\nL=384\nL=512\nL=768\nL=1024\n\nc\n\nC/N\n\n7\n\n\u03be\n\n6.5\n\ns\n\n60\n\n5.5\n\n20\n0\n0.4532\n\n0.4534\n\n0.4536\n\n0.4538\n\n0.454\n\n2.8\n\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n800\n\n1000 1200\n\nL\n\n3.2\n3\n\nT=0.45324\n\n80\n\n40\n\nT\nL=64\nL=128\nL=256\nL=512\nL=1024\n\nFIG. 2: Spin correlation length \u03bes (T, L) measured at the\nchiral transition temperature Tc = 0.45324 for various system\nsizes.\n\n2.6\n\nC/N\n\n100\n\n6\n\n5\n0.453\n\nb)\n\n\u03bes=120\n\n120\n\n2.4\n2.2\n\nTs\n\n2\n1.8\n1.6\n0.442\n\n0.444\n\n0.446\n\n0.448\n\n0.45\n\nT\nFIG. 1: The temperature dependence of the specific heat per\nspin. The panels a) and b) show the data around the chiral\ntransition temperature Tc and spin transition temperature Ts ,\nrespectively. The arrows indicate the estimated transition\ntemperature for the chirality Tc , and for the spin Ts .\n\nspecific heat. Therefore it is natural to expect that the\nspecific-heat-peak is associated with the chiral transition.\nIn order to estimate the bulk chiral transition temperature Tc , we show in Fig. 3 the size dependence of\nthe specific-heat-peak temperature Tpeak(L). Interestingly, the system-size dependence of the peak temperature Tpeak (L) exhibits a crossover behaviour around\nL = L\u00d7 \u223c 200: For sizes smaller than L\u00d7 \u223c 200,\nTpeak (L) exhibits a near-linear dependence, while for\nsizes greater than L\u00d7 , Tpeak(L) exhibits another nearlinear dependence but with a different slope. By making\na linear extrapolation of Tpeak (L) for large enough system sizes L > L\u00d7 \u223c 200, we get an estimate of the chiral\ncritical temperature, Tc = 0.45324(1): See Fig. 3(b). It\nimplies that the long-range order of the chirality is established at Tc = 0.45324(1) via a second-order phase\ntransition. Since the finite-size scaling ansatz implies\nTpeak (L) \u2248 Tc + constL\u22121/\u03bdc where the critical exponent \u03bdc describes the divergence of the chiral correlation\nlength, the chiral transition is characterized by \u03bdc \u2243 1,\nwhich is consistent with the the Ising universality class.\nOur present estimate of Tc and the Ising nature of the\n\ntransition are consistent with the results of many recent\nworks, particularly with the most recent result by Hasenbusch et al who gave Tc = 0.45324(1) [21, 22].\nNow we turn to the issue of the crossover observed\naround L\u00d7 \u223c 200, which is likely to reflect a change in\nthe nature of the ordering of the spin. In the inset of\nFig. 2, we show the size dependence of the spin correlation length \u03bes at the chiral transition point Tc = 0.45324\ndetermined above. As can be seen from the figure, \u03bes (Tc )\ntends to saturate for large enough sizes of L > 200,\nyielding \u03bes (Tc ) \u223c 120, which is indeed comparable to\nthe crossover length scale L\u00d7 \u223c 200 determined above.\nThis result indicates that the observed size-crossover reflects the change in the ordering behavior of the system\nfrom the 'spin-chirality coupling' regime where the spin\ncorrelation dominates the ordering to the 'spin-chirality\ndecoupling' regime where the chiral correlation outgrows\nthe spin correlation and dominates the ordering of the\nsystem.\nThe universality of the chiral transition of the 2D\nFFXY model has been a matter of intense debate in\nthe previous studies. Most probably, the source of the\nconfusion is this size-crossover effect associated with the\nspin-chirality coupling/decoupling. If one looked at small\nenough systems compared with the crossover length L\u00d7 ,\none should find an effective \u03bd-exponent close to unity\nas demonstrated in Fig. 1(a), which would suggest the\nIsing universality. This was actually observed in simulations in early days [3, 24], where system sizes in the\nrange 10 < L < 50 were studied. However, if one focused\non intermediate length scales around L\u00d7 , one would find\n\u03bd < 1, which would suggest the non-Ising universality\n[13, 14, 18\u201320, 25]. Then, at length scales sufficiently\nlarger than L\u00d7 , the effective \u03bd-exponent would become\ncloser to unity again [21, 22]. Our present estimates of Tc\nand \u03bd are in perfect agreement with the recent estimates\nof Hasenbusch et al [21, 22].\n\n\f5\n\na)\n\n0.46\n\n0.96\n\na)\n\nTc(L)\n\nL=256\nL=384\nL=512\nL=768\nL=1024\n\n0.95\n\n0.459\n0.94\n\n0.458\n\n0.93\n0.92\n\n0.457\n\nT\n\ngc\n\n0.456\n0.455\n\n0.88\n0.87\n\n0.453\n\n0.86\n0.453\n\n0.452\n0\n\n0.005\n\n0.01\n\n0.015\n\n0.4531\n\n0.02\n\n1/L\n\n0.4532\n\nb)\n\n1.2\n\n0.454\n\n1.1\n\n\u03bec/L\n\n0.4542\n\nL=256\nL=384\nL=512\nL=768\nL=1024\n\n1\n0.9\n\n0.4534\n\n0.8\n\n0.4532\n\n0.7\n\n0.453\n\n0.6\n\n0.4528\n\n0.4534\n\n1.4\n1.3\n\nTc(L)\n\n0.4536\n\n0.4533\n\nT\n\n0.4544\n\n0.4538\n\nT\n\n0.9\n0.89\n\n0.454\n\nb)\n\n0.91\n\n0.5\n0.453\n\n0.4531\n\n0.4532\n\n0.4533\n\n0.4534\n\n0.4526\n0.4524\n0\n\n0.001\n\n0.002\n\n0.003\n\n0.004\n\n0.005\n\n1/L\nFIG. 3: The specific-heat-peak temperature Tpeak (L) plotted\nversus the inverse linear size 1/L, for (a) all sizes investigated,\nand for (b) larger sizes.

As shown in Fig. 4(a), the chiral Binder parameter gc (T, L) of different sizes exhibit clear crossings. The\nscaled correlation-length, or the chiral correlation-length\nratio \u03bec (T, L), also exhibits similar crossings as shown in\nFig. 4(b).\nTo analyze the size dependence of the crossing points\nquantitatively, we label the system sizes in the ascending order L1 < L2 . . . and plot in Fig. 5 the crossings\npoint Tcross (L) of the Binder parameter and of the chiral\ncorrelation-length ratio at adjacent sizes Ln+1 and Ln\nas a function of the average size Lav = Ln+12+Ln . As in\nthe case of the specific-heat-peak temperature, the crossing temperature Tcross (L) of both the Binder parameter\n\nT\nFIG. 4: The temperature dependence of (a) the chiral Binder\nparameter gc , and of (b) the chiral correlation-length ratio\n\u03bec /L.\n\nand the correlation-length ratio exhibits a size-crossover\nat around L \u223c 200, the same crossover length observed\nin the specific heat, where a non-monotonic size dependence with an abrupt turnover takes place. With use of\nthe data of larger sizes L > L\u00d7 , the chiral transition temperature is estimated as Tc = 0.45324(5), which agrees\nwell with the estimate above obtained from the specific\nheat Tc = 0.45324(1).\nTo examine the universality of the chiral transition\nfurther, we analyze the chiral susceptibility \u03c7c . At the\nchiral transition temperature Tc , a power-law behaviour\n\u03c7c (Tc , L) \u221d L2\u2212\u03b7c is expected with a chiral anomalousdimension exponent \u03b7c . We analyze the data at each\ntemperature T shown in Fig. 6 by fitting them to the\nform \u03c7c (T, L) = a(T ) + b(T )L2\u2212\u03b7eff (T ) with three fitting\nparameters a(T ), b(T ) and \u03b7eff (T ).\nThe temperature dependence of the effective exponent\n\u03b7eff (T ) is displayed in Fig. 7(a). We find that, at the chiral transition temperature Tc = 0.45324 estimated above,\nthe effective exponent \u03b7eff (T ) takes a value 0.25(3). This\nobservation is consistent with the expected Ising value\n\u03b7 = 1/4, giving further support to the Ising nature of the\nchiral transition.\nIn Fig. 7(b), we display the temperature dependence of\nour another fitting parameter a(T ). Presumably, this parameter reflects fluctuations at short length scales where\n\n\f6\n0.4538\n\ngc\n\u03bec/L\n\n0.4536\n\nT\n\n0.4534\n0.4532\n0.453\n0.4528\n0\n\n0.004\n\n0.008\n\n0.012\n\n0.016\n\n1/L\nFIG. 5: Crossing temperatures of the chiral Binder parameter\ngc and of the chiral correlation-length ratio \u03bec /L are plotted\nversus the inverse linear size 1/L.

For comparison, a powerlaw L\u2212\u03b7 behavior with the Ising exponent \u03b7 = 1/4 is also\nshown by the dotted line.\n\nchiral and spin orders are not separated. The increase of\na(T ) with decreasing temperature T may be interpreted\nas due to the growth of the spin correlation length \u03bes (T )\napproaching Ts .\nC.\n\nSpin-related quantities\n\nNext, we examine the ordering of the spin. The\nspin Binder parameter gs (T, L) and the spin correlationlength ratio \u03bes (T, L)/L are shown in Fig. 8(a) and (b),\nrespectively. Data of different sizes exhibit crossings as in\nthe case of chirality shown in Fig. 4. From the raw data,\nit is already evident that the spin crossing temperatures\n\nare considerably lower than chiral transition temperature\nTc = 0.45324(1). It means that the chirality and the spin\nexhibit two separate transitions.\nIn addition, the raw data also suggests a qualitative\ndifference in the nature of the orderings of the spin and\nthe chirality. In case of the spin shown in Fig. 8, the separation between the data points of different sizes tends\nto become increasingly small for larger systems, exhibiting a marginal behavior, whereas in case of the chirality\nshown in Fig. 4 the data points of different system sizes\nremain well separated even for larger systems. This difference reflects the fact that, while the chirality exhibits\na finite long-range order at finite temperature even in 2D,\nthe spin cannot establish a true long-range order at finite\ntemperature but only a quasi-long-range order.\nThe effective vorticity modulus v1 and v2 defined by\nEq. (18) and Eq. (19) are displayed in Fig. 9(a) and\n(b), respectively. The effective vorticity modulus v1 exhibits a stronger finite-size effect compared with v2 , as\nexpected. v2 exhibit merging behaviour at low temperatures suggesting the onset of the quasi-long ranged order.\nAgain, it can be seen that the crossing temperatures of\nthe vorticity modulus are considerably lower than the\nchiral transition temperature Tc = 0.45324(1).\n\n\f7\n\na)\n\n1\nL=64\nL=128\nL=256\nL=512\nL=1024\n\n0.99\n0.98\n\na)\n\n1.6\nL=64\nL=128\nL=256\nL=512\nL=1024\n\n1.4\n1.2\n\n0.97\n\ngs\n\nv1\n\n0.96\n0.95\n\n1\n0.8\n\n0.94\n\n0.6\n0.93\n\n0.4\n\n0.92\n0.442\n\n0.444\n\n0.446\n\n0.448\n\n0.45\n\n0.442\n\nT\n\n0.446\n\n0.448\n\n0.45\n\n0.452\n\n0.454\n\nT\n\nb)\n\nL=64\nL=128\nL=256\nL=512\nL=1024\n\n0.86\n0.84\n\nb)\n\n2.5\n64-128\n128-256\n256-512\n512-1024\n\n2\n\n0.82\n\n\u03bes/L\n\n0.444\n\n0.8\n\n1.5\n\n0.78\n\nv2\n\n0.76\n\n1\n0.74\n0.72\n\n0.5\n\n0.7\n0.442\n\n0.444\n\n0.446\n\n0.448\n\n0.45\n\nT\n\n0\n0.442\n\n0.444\n\n0.446\n\n0.448\n\n0.45\n\n0.452\n\n0.454\n\nT\nFIG. 8: The temperature dependence of (a) the spin Binder\nparameter gs , and of (b) the spin correlation-length ratio \u03bes /L.\nEvidently the crossing temperatures are lower than the chiral\ntransition temperature Tc = 0.45324.\n\nNow we estimate quantitatively the spin transition\ntemperature Ts based on our data of the crossing temperatures of several observables presented above. Thus, the\ncrossing temperatures Tcross (L) of the spin Binder parameter gs (T, L), the spin correlation-length ratio \u03bes (T, L)/L\nand the effective vorticity modulus v1 between the two\nadjacent sizes L1 and L2 are plotted against 1/(ln Lav )2\nin Fig.10. Note that this form\n\u221a is motivated by the standard KT form \u03bes \u223c exp[c/ T \u2212 Ts ]. From the combined\nfit of these data where a common spin transition temperature Ts is assumed, we get an estimate of the bulk spin\ntransition temperature Ts = 0.4418(5).\nIn Fig.10 we also display the size dependence of\nthe crossing points of the spin correlation-length ratio\n\u03bes (T, L)/L between the two sizes L and sL with s = 2, 4, 8\nplotted as a function of 1/(ln L)2 . From the combined fit\nof these three data sets where a common spin transition\ntemperature Ts is assumed, we get Ts = 0.4414(3) which\nis consistent with our estimate presented above.\nIn order to examine the universality of the spin transition, we also analyze the sublattice spin susceptibility\n\u03c7s . At and below the spin transition temperature Ts ,\na power-law behaviour \u03c7s (Tc , L) \u221d L2\u2212\u03b7(T ) is expected\nwith a spin anomalous-dimension exponent \u03b7(T ). We\n\nFIG. 9: The temperature dependence of the two types of the\neffective vorticity modulus, (a) v1 defined by Eq. (18), and b)\nv2 defined by Eq.

We find that,\nat the spin transition temperature Ts = 0.4418(5) estimated above, the effective exponent \u03b7eff (T ) takes a value\n0.201(2). Remarkably, this value is significantly smaller\nthan the value of the conventional Kosterlitz-Thouless\n(KT) transition \u03b7 = 1/4 [7]. This observation suggests\nthat the universality of the spin-transition of the present\n2D FFXY model might be different from that of the the\nconventional KT transition.\nTo get further insight, we also examine the helicity\nmodulus. In 2D XY models, the helicity modulus is\nexpected to exhibit a discontinuous jump from zero at\nhigher temperatures to a nonzero value Ts /(2\u03c0\u03b7(Ts )) at\nthe critical temperature Ts . From the raw data displayed in Fig. 13, we extract the intersection points\nbetween the helicity-modulus data of each size and a\nstraight line T /(2\u03c0\u03b7(Ts )) by setting \u03b7(Ts ) = 0.201(2) as\nobtained above. Then, the size dependence of the resulting intersection points is displayed in Fig. 14.

L in the horizontal\naxis is the average system size. The combined straight-line\nfits for three kinds of crossing temperatures assuming a common Ts yields Ts = 0.4418(5). In addition, crossing temperatures of the spin correlation-length ratio \u03bes /L between the\ntwo sizes L and sL with s = 2, 4, 8 are also shown as a function of 1/(ln L)2 . The combined fit using the last three data\nsets assuming a common Ts yields Ts = 0.4414(3).\n\nTs = 0.44185(5). This value of Ts is consistent with our\nestimate above Ts = 0.4418(5) obtained from the Binder\nparameter, the correlation-length ratio and the vorticity\nmodulus.\nIf one assumes instead the conventional KT value\n\u03b7(Ts ) = 1/4 in the above analysis of the helicity modulus as was done in Refs.[16, 21, 22], one obtains Ts =\n0.44619(4) as displayed in Fig. 14. The latter value\nagrees well with the estimate of Ts = 0.446 (Ref.[16])\nand Ts = 0.4461(1) (Ref.[21, 22]). However, this value is\nnot compatible with our present estimate of Ts obtained\nfrom other quantities without assuming a specific value\nfor the exponent \u03b7(Ts ), Ts = 0.4415(3).\nOur result indicates that the jump of the helicitymodulus is greater than the so-called 'universal jump'\nfor the conventional KT transition [39\u201341]. Lee and Lee\n[18] made a similar observation in the FFXY model on\nthe triangular lattice. Indeed, such a possibility was mentioned occasionally since early days of research [2].\n\nIV.\n\nSUMMARY AND DISCUSSIONS\n\nWe studied the ordering of the spin and the chirality\nof the 2D FFXY model on the square lattice by extensive\nMonte Carlo simulations performed up to very large system size to circumvent crossover effects. We found the\nthe chiral transition takes place at Tc = 0.45324(1), while\nspin transition takes place at Ts = 0.4418(5).

In Fig. 15 we display\nthe raw data of the correlation length of the chirality and\nof the spin. Evidently, the two correlation lengths are almost equal at higher temperatures T > 0.468, behaving\nside by side. This is the spin-chirality coupling behavior expected in the high-temperature regime. At lower\ntemperatures, the bulk chiral correlation length becomes\ndefinitely longer than the bulk spin correlation length.\nFor instance, at T = 0.456 we find \u03bec \u223c 65 while \u03bes \u223c 45.\nIn the temperature range T < 0.458, we get into the\nspin-chirality decoupling regime. At the chiral transition temperature Tc = 0.45324(1), the chiral correlation\nlength diverges while the spin correlation length \u03bes (Tc , L)\n\n\f9\n600\n\n0.38\n\n500\n\n0.34\n\nY\n\nL=128\nL=128\nL=256\nL=256\n\n\u03b7=0.201\n\n0.36\n\nL=64\nL=128\nL=256\nL=512\nL=1024\n\n0.32\n0.3\n\n\u03be\n\n400\n\n300\n\n200\n\n0.28\n\n\u03b7=1/4\n\n0.26\n\n100\n\n0.24\n0.442\n\n0.444\n\n0.446\n\n0.448\n\n0.45\n\n0.452\n\n0.454\n\n0\n0.452\n\n0.454\n\nT\n\n0.456\n\n0.458\n\n0.46\n\nT\n\nFIG. 13: The temperature dependence of the helicity modulus.

The universality class of the chiral transition is well\ncompatible with the Ising universality. On the other\nhand, the universality class of the spin transition is different from the conventional KT transition.\nPossibility of the non-universal jump of the helicity\nmodulus was pointed out on the general ground of a refined renormalization-group scheme by Minnhagen [42]\nand was argued to be relevant to the fully frustrated XY\nmodel [26]. However the true connection to the frustration system was not necessarily clear. The spin and the\nchirality orderings of the fully frustrated XY model was\nalso studied by Choi and Stroud by means of a renormalization group analysis of the coupled XY model which is\nbelieved to be essentially equivalent to the FFXY model\n\n[33]. The possible non-universal jump of the helicity\nmodulus was suggested [34, 35]. The latter RG scheme\n[33\u201335] is quite appealing since it aimed at studying the\nordering behaviours of both the chirality and the spin in\na unified manner. However, the assumption underlying\nthe derivation of the RG equations, i. e. the smallness of\nthe fugacity of the both the usual spin vorticies and extra charges responsible for the ordering of the chirality,\neach being justifiable in the low-temperature and in the\nhigh-temperature limits, cannot be satisfied asymptotically upon renormalization at any temperature. It will be\nvery interesting to investigate further the nature of the\nspin transition in the presence of the chiral long-ranged\norder, which is not considered in conventional theories\nfor the KT transition.\nThe numerical calculations were carried out partly on\nSX8 at Yukawa Institute of Theoretical Physics in Kyoto\nUniversity and on SX-8R at the Cybermedia Center in\nOsaka University.
