Recent observational developments\nindicate that isolated neutron stars also manifest themselves as other\nspecies (Pavlov et al. 2002, for a review), among which soft gamma-ray\nrepeaters (SGRs) and anomalous X-ray repeaters (AXPs) have attracted\ngrowing attention in the neutron star community. These two types of\nobjects originate, respectively, from the anomalous species of two distinct classes of phenomenon, i.e., gamma-ray bursts and accreting X-ray\npulsars, but share many common features. Recently, two observational\nfacts finally connect a bridge between SGRs and AXPs. First, after being quiescent for more than twenty years, SGR 0526-66 is found to have\na steep non-thermal spectrum in the quiescent state which is similar to\n\n1\n\n\f2\nthe non-bursting AXPs (Kulkarni et al. 2003). Second, soft, repeating\nbursts were recently detected from two AXPs, 1E 1048-5937 (Gavriil,\nKaspi & Woods 2002) and 1E 2259+586 (Kaspi & Gavriil 2002). These\nsuggest that SGRs/AXPs belong to a unified class of objects.\nIn the literature, there exist essentially four types of models to interpret SGR/AXP phenomenology. These are, according to the sequence of\npopularity, the magnetar model (Duncan & Thompson 1992; Paczy\u0144ski\n1992; Thompson & Duncan 1995, 1996; Thompson, Lyutikov & Kulkarni\n2002), the accretion model involving fossil disks (Chatterjee et al. 2000;\nAlpar 2001; Masden et al. 2001), the models involving strange quark\nstars (Alcock et al. 1986; Cheng & Dai 1998; Zhang, Xu & Qiao 2000;\nUsov 2001), and the models involving magnetic white dwarfs (Paczy\u0144ski\n1990; Usov 1993). It is fair to say that at the current stage none of the\nmodels can interpret all SGR/AXP observations satisfactorily. Nonetheless, the magnetar model has its merit to interpret most observations\nunder one single hypothesis, i.e., SGRs/AXPs are neutron stars with\nsuperstrong magnetic fields (\u223c 1014 \u2212 1015 G at the surface). Other\nmodels either have troubles to interpret some observations (e.g. the\naccretion model fails to account for the super-Eddington SGR bursts)\nor have to introduce additional assumptions to account for data (e.g.\nZhang 2002a for a review). Below I will list the solid observational facts\nof SGR/AXPs and confront them with the magnetar model.\n1. Timing properties. Known SGRs/AXPs exclusively have long\nperiods [P \u223c (5\u221212) s] and large spindown rates [\u1e56 \u223c 5\u00d7(10\u221213 \u221210\u221210 )\ns/s]. Assuming magnetic braking, this directly refers to a superstrong\nsurface magnetic fields [Bs \u223c (1014 \u2212 1015 ) G if these objects are neutron stars. Irregular spindown may be a common feature of these objects,\nand is not necessarily related to the bursting behavior. This could be accomendated in a magnetar model with twisted magnetosphere (Thompson et al. 2002).\n2. Quiescent emission properties. SGRs/AXPs all display a\nsteady luminous X-ray emission with Lx \u223c (1035 \u2212 1036 ) ergs/s, which\ncould be explained in terms of magnetic dissipation (magnetic field decay, Thompson & Duncan 1996; or magnetic enhanced cooling, Heyl\n& Hernquist 1998; or untwisting of a global current-carrying magnetosphere, Thompson et al. 2002). Optical/IR counterparts have been\ndetected from three AXPs (4U 0142+61, 1E 2259+586, and 1E 1048.15937), but no promising interpretation within the magnetar model is\nproposed. No gamma-ray and radio emission has been firmly detected\nfrom the SGRs/AXPs.\n3. Burst properties. SGR bursts are soft and repeating, with\nluminosity ranging from 1038 ergs/s all the way up to \u223c 1045 ergs/s\n\n\f3\n\nMagnetars and pulsars: a missing link\n\n(usually super-Eddington, and two most luminous bursts, namely giant\nflares, have been detected from SGR 0526-66 on March 5, 1979; and\nfrom SGR 1900+14 on August 27, 1998). A strength of the magnetar\nmodel is that it can interpret the bursting phenomenology successfully\nin terms of the magnetic cataclysmic dissipation events in superstrong\nmagnetic fields. Super-Eddington bursts are natural in strong fields in\nwhich the Thomson cross section is suppressed.\n4. Environmental effects. Most SGRs/AXPs are located close\nto supernova remnants (SNRs) in projection. Solid associations with\nthe SNRs are yet firmly established. Real associations are consistent\nwith the magnetar theory which predicts that these objects are young\nneutron stars, but the SNR ages are not fully consistent with the spindown age of these objects. Assuming associations, SGRs have larger\nproper motions than AXPs. That one AXP with SNR association, 1E\n2259+586, recently displayed hundreds of repeating bursts make the issue more complicated. The claim that SGRs/AXPs are born in dense\nenvironments (Marsden et al. 2001) is not confirmed (Gaensler et al.\n2001).\n5. Cyclotron features. Cyclotron features have been detected in\nSGR outbursts (Ibrahim et al. 2002), which is consistent with the magnetar model if the features are of proton-origin, but refers to a much\nlower magnetic field if the features are of electron-origin.\nIn summary, though not fully unquestionable, the magnetar model is\nsuccessful in many respects in interpreting the data. However, there is\nhitherto no definite proof that SGRs/AXPs are isolated neutron stars\npowered by superstrong magnetic fields. I believe that the key to prove\nthe magnetar interpretation would be looking for a missing link between\nmagnetars and normal pulsars, which I will lay out in the next section.\n\n2.\n\nTwo energy sources in magnetars, and a\nmissing link between magnetars and pulsars\n\nIf SGRs/AXPs are magnetars, there should be two independent energy sources in these objects, i.e., the magnetic energy and the spin\nenergy of a neutron star. Assuming a dipole geometry, the total magnetic energy in a magnetar magnetosphere is EB \u2243 (1/12)Bp2 R3 . Taking\nBp = 6.4 \u00d7 1019 G\nbe estimated\n\np\n\nP \u1e56 , and R = 106 cm R6 , the magnetic energy can\n\nEB = 1.7 \u00d7 1046 ergs (P/5 s)\u1e56\u221211 R63 ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u1e56\u221211 = \u1e56 /(10\u221211 ). The rotation energy of the magnetar is\nER = (1/2)I\u03a92 = 7.9 \u00d7 1044 erg I45 (P/5 s)\u22122 ,\n\n(2)\n\n\f4\nwhere I = 1045 g cm3 I45 is the typical momentum of inertia of the\nmagnetar. The critical line in the P \u2212 \u1e56 diagram for the magnetic\nenergy domination is\n\u1e56\u221211 > 5.8P \u22123 I45 R6\u22123 .\n\n(3)\n\nIn reality, what is more relevant is to compare the energy release rate\nof the magnetic energy and the spin energy. The former could be in\nprinciple written LB = dEB /dt = \u2212(1/6)(dBp /dt)Bp R3 . Theoretically,\ndBp /dt is rather uncertain. It is more straightforward to take LB \u223c\n1035 \u2212 1036 erg s\u22121 directly from the observations, e.g.\nLB = 1035 erg s\u22121 LB,35 (B),\n\n(4)\n\nwhere LB,35 (B) is an unknown function of B, but may be insensitive to\nB when Bp \u223c 1014 \u2212 1015 G. The spindown luminosity is\nLsd = \u2212I\u03a9\u03a9\u0307 = 4\u03c0 2 IP \u22123 \u1e56 = 3.2 \u00d7 1033 erg s\u22121 I45 (P/5 s)\u22123 \u1e56\u221211 . (5)\nLet LB > Lsd , the condition of magnetic luminosity domination is\n1/3 1/3\n\nP > 1.6 s \u1e56\u221211 I45 LB,35 (B).\n\u22121/3\n\n(6)\n\nIt is found that for the typical values of P and \u1e56 of magnetars, these\nobjects all lie in the magnetic-dominated regime. Nonetheless, they are\nnot far from the transition boundary. More important, all magnetars\nought to be born with millisecond initial period to ensure vigorous dynamo process to occur (Thompson & Duncan 1993), which means that\nover the early lifetime of a magnetar, the spindown energy should be the\ndominant energy source. Even at the present epoch (for typical P and \u1e56\nof magnetars), the spindown luminosities (which marks the magnitudes\nof the pulsar behaviors) are not too low. In fact, many pulsars with such\nsimilar Lsd 's are detected to be active.\nThen there comes a missing link between the magnetars and the radio\npulsars. These two types of isolated neutron stars seem to solely manifest the two types of energy sources, respectively. The spindown energy\nis clearly manifested in pulsars in terms of coherent radio emission, and\nnon-thermal gamma-ray and X-ray emission; while in magnetars the\nmagnetic dissipation energy is manifested in the form of luminous Xrays in the quiescent state and of soft gamma-rays in the burst state.\nWithin the dominant energy output channel for the spindown luminosity,\ni.e., the radio band and the gamma-ray band, magnetars are not firmly\ndetected. If lack of magnetic-dominated behavior in normal pulsars is\nunderstandable because of their weak fields involved, non-detection of\n\n\fMagnetars and pulsars: a missing link\n\n5\n\nthe spindown-powered behavior in magnetars is in principle not justified. It is worth emphasizing that lack of radio and gamma-ray emission\nis the prediction of the accretion model for AXPs. Therefore studying\nthe spindown-powered behavior from magnetars is of great theoretical\nand observational interests. Only when any spindown-powered behavior\nis firmly detected in SGRs/AXPs, could the accretion model be completely ruled out, and hence, presenting a final proof of the magnetar\ninterpretation.\n\n3.\n\nSpindown-powered activity in magnetars\n\nThe pulsar behavior is marked by the pair-production activity in the\nmagnetosphere. Particles are believed to be accelerated in gaps either\nin the polar cap region near the surface (Ruderman & Sutherland 1975;\nArons & Scharlemann 1979; Harding & Muslimov 1998) or above the null\ncharge surface (Cheng, Ho & Ruderman 1986). Accelerated primary particles radiate through curvature radiation or inverse Compton scattering, and the resultant gamma-rays produce electron-positron pairs either\nthrough one photon (\u03b3(B) \u2192 e+ e\u2212 (B)) or two photon (\u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 )\nprocesses. In the polar cap region, the secondary pairs also radiate\nvia synchrotron radiation and inverse Compton scattering, leading to\na photon-pair cascade (Daugherty & Harding 1996; Zhang & Harding\n2000a). The condition that pair production is prohibited defines radio\npulsar death. Conventionally, this is defined through an energy budget\ncriterion that requires a minimum potential to accelerate particles to a\nhigh enough energy in order to allow pair production to occur. This\ndefines a pulsar death valley in the long P regime (e.g. Zhang 2002b\nfor a review). According to this criterion, the known magnetars are\nwell above the death line, so that their spindown-powered activity is in\nprinciple not prohibited.\nIn order to interpret the apparent radio quiescence of SGRs/AXPs,\nBaring & Harding (1998, 2001) argued that pair production is suppressed\nin magnetars by another more exotic QED process, i.e., magnetic photon splitting. This interpretation relies on the assumption that all three\nphoton splitting modes permitted by charge-parity invariance operate together due to (possible) strong vacuum dispersion effect in superstrong\nmagnetic fields, so that photons with both \u22a5 and k polarization modes\ncan split. In such a case, for a high enough magnetic field strength,\nphoton splitting will overwhelm magnetic one photon pair production,\nso that gamma-rays essentially split to photons with lower energies before being materialized, and the magnetar magnetosphere is essentially\npair free. Zhang (2001) later found that even if one photon pair pro-\n\n\f6\nduction can be completely suppressed by photon splitting (as conjectured by Baring & Harding), pairs may be formed via two-photon pair\nproduction, essentially because the magnetar near surface region is a\nhot environment with a copious soft photon bath generated from magnetic dissipation. Another issue is that, as long as particles can keep\nbeing accelerated to higher altitudes where magnetic field strength is\nconsiderably degraded, one photon pair production will overtake photon\nsplitting. This operates for the case of a inner gap type invoking spacecharge-limited flow (Zhang & Harding 2000b). Both arguments suggest\nthat a magnetar magnetosphere may not be pair free.\nNow that the magnetar magnetospheric activity does not differ from\nthat of radio pulsars intrinsically, there are good reasons to expect\npulsar-like spin-powered activities from magnetars.\n1. Low frequency coherent emission from magnetars? If pairs\nare not prohibited in the magnetar magnetosphere, why SGRs/AXPs are\nsilent in the conventional radio band? There could be several possible\nreasons. The most straightforward possibility is that they are actually\nradio loud, but the radio beams do not sweep towards us due to a very\nnarrow beaming angle of a slow rotator (Gaensler et al. 2001). Other\npossibilities include that the typical coherent emission frequency is not in\nthe conventional radio band (Zhang 2001; Eichler, Gedalin & Lyubarsky\n2002), or that the coherent condition is fragile and is destroyed in the\nhot and twisted magnetospheric environment.\n2. Non-thermal high energy emission from magnetars? Nonthermal high energy emission is expected from both polar cap cascades\nand/or from outer gaps in magnetars. In the outer gap scenario, the\ngamma-ray luminosities of the magnetars have been recently predicted\n(Cheng & Zhang 2001; Zhang & Cheng 2002), which are consistent with\nthe current upper limits on these objects. According to these predictions,\nsome SGRs/AXPs should be detectable by the next generation gammaray detector, GLAST. In the polar cap scenario, high energy emission is\nalso expected, but the typical spectrum would be considerbly shifted to\nthe softer regime due to the large opacities of the gamma-rays (due to\none-photon, two-photon pair production and photon splitting). Also the\nbeaming angle is correspondingly smaller. More work in this direction\nneeds to be carried out.\n3. High energy neutrinos from magnetars? Zhang, Dai, M\u00e9sz\u00e1ros\n& Waxman (2002) recently discussed another possible consequence of the\nmagnetar spindown-powered activity. The discussion is relevant to one\nhalf of the magnetar population, i.e., those with favorable geometry such\nthat positive ions (likely protons or light nuclei) are accelerated from\nthe polar cap region. For those magnetars that rotate rapidly enough,\n\n\fMagnetars and pulsars: a missing link\n\n7\n\nthe acceleration potential would be enough to accelerate protons to the\nenergies above the photonmeson threshold, so that these protons will\ninteract with the soft photon bath near the surface and produce pions\nand neutrinos. The condition for the photomeson interaction threshold\n1/2 3/2\nis P < (2.4 \u2212 6.8) s Bp,15 R6 . This defines a \"neutrino death valley\"\nin the magnetar P \u2212 \u1e56 (or P \u2212 Bp ) space. Four magnetars are found\nto be within or slightly below the valley, which means that under favorable conditions, they are high energy neutrino emitters. Taking into\naccount pion cooling, the typical neutrino energy is several TeV. For\non-beam detections, SGR 1900+14 and 1E 1048-5937 have substantial\nneutrino fluxes, making them interesting targets for the planned large\narea Cherenkov detectors. The whole magnetar population in the universe adds an interesting contribution to the diffuse high energy neutrino\nbackground and the diffuse gamma-ray background.\nIn the above discussions about magnetar gap accelerations, a dipole\nconfiguration is assumed, whilst a magnetar magnetosphere is certainly\nnon-dipole. More specifically, Thompson et al. (2002) argue that the\nSGR/AXP phenomenology is consistent with the hypothesis that the\nmagnetar magnetosphere is globally twisted. It would be interesting to\nstudy the charge-depleted acceleration regions in such a twisted magnetosphere, both near the polar cap region and in the \"outer gap\" region.\nA careful study in this direction is called for.\n\n4.\n\nConcluding remark\n\nCurrent data reveals a missing link between magnetars and pulsars.\nSeveral theoretical efforts have been made to predict spindown-powered\nactivities in magnetars. Connecting this missing link with future observations would provide a solid proof that SGRs/AXPs are indeed isolated\nneutron stars with strong magnetic fields, i.e., magnetars.\n\nAcknowledgment\nI thank A.

The internal compositions and equations-of-state of \"neutron stars\" are not well determined.
