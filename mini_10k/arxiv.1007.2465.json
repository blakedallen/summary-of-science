Estimates of glueball properties were\nobtained in a variety of approaches [5], ranging from model analyses [6\u201313] ,quenched lattice\nQCD (QLQCD)[14\u201318] and unquenched lattice QCD (UQLQCD) simulations [19, 20] to\nQCD sum rule calculations [21\u201333].\nThe lowest 0++ scalar glueball state is, in fact, the most intricate hadron state which\nis difficult to figure out. In lattice QCD (LQCD) the mass scale of the scalar glueball is\npredicted to be in the rang of 1.3-1.7 GeV [14\u201318]. The 0++ scalar resonances closest to this\nenergy range are f0 (1500) and f0 (1710) in the present data [34], and some authors favor the\nformer as the lightest scalar glueball [35, 36], while some others prefer the latter [10, 18].\nFurthermore, both f0 (1500) and f0 (1710) may not be pure glueballs; to the contrary, these\nresonances can be considered to be the mixture of glueball and mesons [7\u20139, 37]. In the\nQCD sum rule approach, the results of the mass of the scalar glueball are also different\nfrom each other. In the early days of QCD, some found a light 0++ scalar glueball in the\nregion of 300-700 MeV [3, 30\u201333] using the subtracted sum rule (SSR), while the others\nobtained a much heavier one in the 1-2 GeV region [38, 39] by using the unsubtracted sum\nrule (USSR). The inconsistency between both subtracted and unsubtracted sum rules has\nbothered scientists for many years.\nIt should be noticed that, in the early QCD sum rule approach, it was already recognized\nthat there is an onset of the nonperturbative physics (a departure from the asymptotic\n[4]. Such\nfreedom) in the scalar glueball correlator at unusually short distances |x| \u226a \u039b\u22121\nQCD\nhard nonperturbative effects are usually considered to be coming from direct instantons, i.e.\nthe tunneling processes which rearrange the QCD vacuum topology in localized regions[40,\n41]. This physics was ignored in the early glueball sum rules except in Ref. [42].\nRecently, a sizeable instanton contribution to the QCD sum rules of the 0++ scalar\nglueball has been found on the basis of the instanton liquid model of the QCD vacuum\n[40, 41], and supported by the lattice simulations [42\u201346]. However, the instanton-induced\ncontinuum contributions are neglected in the early QCD sum rule approach, and thus a\nreliable estimate of the glueball properties cannot be obtained. On the basis of the instantonimproved operator-product expansion (OPE), the authors in Refs. [23\u201325] included the\ninstanton-induced contributions to the continuum spectrum, made a great improvement\nto the consistency between different types of 0++ scalar glueball sum rules, and gave new\npredictions for the mass and decay constant confirmed later by the Gaussian sum rule\n(GSR) calculation [27]. Moreover, we have clarified that the stability and the consistency\nfor the SSR and USSRs for the 0++ scalar glueball can be obtained by using a systematical\nsemiclassical expansion of the background instanton fields in the instanton liquid model of\nthe QCD vacuum [47].\nInstantons, which make a great difference in the scalar and pseudoscalar channels [4, 48,\n49], play a major role in the gluonic interactions, especially in the nonperturbative region\n[40]. Direct instanton contributions are included in the QCD sum rules [23\u201327]. The results\nare found to be in good agreement with different USSRs. The compatibility between the\nSSR and USSRs become much better but are not satisfying yet, because only the leading\nclassic effects are included in most of the calculations with the perturbative contribution\nand condensate contributions. It should be noted that the direct-instanton approximation is\n2\n\n\fcriticized due to the problem of double counting [24], because both condensate and instanton\ncontributions are included in the correlator, but most of the gluon condensates could be\nproduced from instantons.\nUp to now, most of the theoretical calculations for the 0++ scalar glueball were based on\nQCD Laplace sum rules (LSR), which emphasize the contributions of the lowest resonance,\nand have shown the power in the investigation of the nonperturbative properties of the\nhadron ground states. On the other hand, it should be noticed that the GSR developed later\nemphasizes only the contribution of the state considered, and has a cleaner background in\ncomparison with the LSR. As a cross-check, the same problem should be investigated using\nGSR, because both Laplace and Gaussian sum rules are derived from the same underlying\ndynamical theory, and should give almost the same results.\nMotivated by the above considerations, our main objective in this paper is to investigate the 0++ scalar glueball in the frame work of Gaussian sum rules. For the correlation\nfunction, we include the contributions from the interactions between the quantum gluons\nand the classical instanton background besides the ones comeing separately from these two\ndifferent field configurations. For the spectral function, instead of using the usual zero-width\napproximation, we adopt the Breit-Wigner form for the considered resonance with correct\nthreshold behavior, in order to get the information of not only the mass scale but also the\nfull decay width. Moreover, without using the scheme of the mixture of the traditional\ncondensates and the so-called direct-instanton contribution, we are working in the framework of the semiclassical expansion of QCD in the instanton liquid vacuum, a well-defined\nself-consistent procedure for the quantum theory justified by the path-integral quantization\nformalism. The paper is organized as follows: In Sec. II, we give the expression for the\ncorrelation function of the 0++ scalar gluon current. The spectral function corresponding\nto this current is constructed in Sec. III. Then, a family of the finite-width Gaussian sum\nrules are derived in Sec. IV. In Sec. V, the numerical simulation is carried out. Finally, a\nsummery of our conclusions and a discussion are given in Sec. VI.\nII.\n\nCORRELATION FUNCTION\n\nThe correlation function for the scalar glueball in the Euclidean space-time with a virtuality q 2 is defined by\nZ\n2\n\u03a0(q ) = d4 xeiq*x h\u03a9|T Os (x)Os (0)|\u03a9i,\n(1)\n\nwhere |\u03a9i is the physical vacuum, and Os the scalar glueball current with the quantum\nnumbers J P C = 0++\nOs = \u03b1s Ga\u03bc\u03bd (B)Ga,\u03bc\u03bd (B),\n(2)\nin which, \u03b1s denotes the strong coupling constant. The scalar glueball current Os is gaugeinvariant, and renormalization-invariant at one-loop level. In the spirit of the semiclassical\nexpansion, and in order to maintain the O(4) covariance, the gluon field strength tensor\nGa\u03bc\u03bd (B) is considered as a functional of the full gluon potential, B\u03bca = A\u03bca + a\u03bca , with A\u03bca\nand a\u03bca being the instanton fields and the corresponding quantum fluctuations.\nThe theoretical expression, \u03a0QCD , for the correlation function \u03a0 may be divided into the\nfollowing three parts\n\u03a0QCD (Q2 ) = \u03a0pert (Q2 ) + \u03a0inst (Q2 ) + \u03a0int (Q2 ),\n3\n\n(3)\n\n\fwhere Q2 = q 2 , and \u03a0pert (Q2 ), \u03a0inst (Q2 ), and \u03a0int (Q2 ) are the contributions from the only\nperturbative QCD, the pure instanton dynamics, and the interactions between the instantons\nand the quantum gluon fields, respectively.\nThe perturbative contribution \u03a0pert (Q2 ) is already known to be\n\u0012 2\u0013\u0014\n\u0012 2\u0013\n\u0012 2 \u0013\u0015\nQ\nQ\nQ\n2\npert\n2\n4\n\u03a0 (Q ) = Q ln\na\n+\na\nln\n+\na\nln\n,\n(4)\n0\n1\n2\n\u03bc2\n\u03bc2\n\u03bc2\nwhere \u03bc2 is the renormalization scale in the MS-dimensional regularization scheme, and the\ncoefficients with the inclusion of the threshold effects are\n\u0010 \u03b1 \u00112 \u0014\n\u0010 \u03b1 \u00112 \u0015\n659 \u0010 \u03b1s \u0011\ns\ns\na0 = \u22122\n1+\n+ 247.48\n,\n\u03c0\n36 \u03c0\n\u03c0\n\u0010 \u03b1 \u00113 \u0014 9\n\u0010 \u03b1 \u0011\u0015\ns\ns\na1 = 2\n,\n(5)\n+ 65.781\n\u03c0\n4\n\u03c0\n\u0010 \u03b1 \u00114\ns\n.\na2 = \u221210.1252\n\u03c0\nfor QCD with three quark flavors up to three-loop level in the chiral limit [27, 28, 50], and\n\u0015\n\u0010 \u03b1 \u00112 \u0014\n51 \u0010 \u03b1s \u0011\ns\n1+\n,\na0 = \u22122\n\u03c0\n4 \u03c0\n11 \u0010 \u03b1s \u00113\na1 =\n, a2 = 0.\n(6)\n2 \u03c0\n\nfor quarkless QCD up to two-loop level [51]. Both expressions for \u03a0pert (Q2 ) with and without\nquark loop corrections are used in our calculation for comparison. With the assumption that\nthe dominant contribution to \u03a0inst (Q2 ) comes from a Belavin-Polyakov-Schwartz-Tyupkin\nsingle instanton and anti-instanton solutions [52\u201354] and the multi-instanton effects are\nnegligible (see a QCD spectral sum rule (QSSR) approach [25]) , and in view of the gaugeinvariance of the correlation function, one may choose to work in the regular gauge of the\nclassical single instanton potential\nAa\u03bc =\n\n2 a\n(x \u2212 x0 )\u03bd\n\u03b7\u03bc\u03bd\n,\ngs\n(x \u2212 x0 )2 + \u03c12\n\n(7)\n\na\nwhere \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd\nis the 't Hooft symbol, and x0 and \u03c1 denote the position and size of the instanton,\nrespectively. The pure instanton contribution is obtained to be [3, 23, 24, 42, 55]\np\n(8)\n\u03a0inst (Q2 ) = 25 \u03c0 2 n\u0304\u03c1\u03044 Q4 K22 ( Q2 \u03c1\u0304),\nR\u221e\nwhere K2 (x) is the McDonald function, n\u0304 = 0 d\u03c1n(\u03c1) and \u03c1\u0304 are the overall instanton\ndensity and the average instanton size in the random instanton background, respectively.\nIt is noticed that the contribution to \u03a0QCD from the interactions between instantons and\nthe quantum gluon fields is of the order of the product of \u03b1s and the overall instanton density\nn\u0304. There is no reason to get rid of this contribution in comparison with the perturbative\ncontributions of the higher order \u03b1s4 considered in \u03a0pert . To calculate such contribution, our\nkey observation is that the instanton potential Aa\u03bc obeys also the fixed-point gauge condition\n\n(x \u2212 x0 )\u03bc Aa\u03bc (x \u2212 x0 ) = 0\n4\n\n(9)\n\n\fdue to the antisymmetry of the 't Hooft symbols. As a consequence, the instanton potential\ncan be expressed in terms of the corresponding field strength tensor as follows:\nZ 1\na\na\nA\u03bc (x \u2212 x0 ) =\nduuF\u03bc\u03bd\n[u(x \u2212 x0 )](x \u2212 x0 )\u03bd\n(10)\n0\n\nand the gauge link with respect to the instanton fields is just the unit operator, and thus the\ntrace of any product of the gauge-covariant instanton field strengths at different points is\ngauge-invariant. This allows us to conclude that the remainder quantum corrections to the\ngauge-invariant correlation function, arising from the interactions between the instantons\nand the quantum gluons, is gauge-invariant as well. Therefore, one may choose any specific\ngauge in evaluating the quantum correction to \u03a0int .\nIt is noticed that the interference between the pure quantum part of the scalar glueball\ncurrent, (Os )quantum , and the pure classical instanton part, (Os )instanton is vanishing due to\nthe fact that the momentum integration of the massless gluon propagator or the product\nof massless quark and gluon propagators has no scale parameters, and is exactly zero in\nthe dimensional regularization scheme. The first nonvanishing contribution comes from the\ncontraction between the two quantum glueball currents with instanton legs. Working in\nFeynman gauge, our result for \u03a0int is\n\u03a0int (Q2 ) = C0 \u03b1s n\u0304\u03c0 + \u03b1s2 n\u0304[C1 + C2 (Q\u03c1\u0304)2 ln(Q\u03c1\u0304)2 + C3 ln(Q\u03c1\u0304)2 + C4 (Q\u03c1\u0304)\u22122 ],\n\n(11)\n\nwhere the coefficients are\nC0 = 62.62, C1 = 1533.15, C2 = 825.81, C3 = \u2212496.33, C4 = \u2212348.89.\n\n(12)\n\nIt is remarkable to note that the fixed point x0 , which characterizes the gauge condition (10),\ndisappears in the expression of \u03a0int , as expected from the gauge invariance of our procedure.\nThe detail calculation for \u03a0int is much involved, and will appear elsewhere.\nIII.\n\nSPECTRAL FUNCTION\n\nNow, we turn to specify the spectral function for the correlation function of the scalar\nglueball current. The imaginary part of the correlation function Eq. (3) is\n\u0014\n\u0013 \u0015\n\u0012\ns\n2 s\nQCD\n2\n2\nIm\u03a0\n(s) = \u2212\u03c0s a0 + 2a1 ln 2 + 3 ln 2 \u2212 \u03c0 a2\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n\u221a\n\u221a\n4 2\n4\n\u221216\u03c0 s n\u0304\u03c1\u0304 J2 (\u03c1\u0304 s)Y2 (\u03c1\u0304 s) + \u03b1s2 n\u0304\u03c0(C2 \u03c1\u03042 s \u2212 C3 ).\n(13)\nThe usual lowest resonance plus a continuum model is used to saturate the phenomenological\nspectral function,\nIm\u03a0PHE (s) = \u03c1had (s) + \u03b8(s \u2212 s0 )Im\u03a0QCD (s),\n(14)\nwhere s0 is the QCD-hadron duality threshold, and \u03c1had (s) the spectral function for the\nlowest scalar glueball state. Instead of using the zero-width approximation as usual, the\nBreit-Wigner form for a single resonance is adopted for \u03c1had (s) in the quarkless world\n\u03c1had (s) =\n\nf 6 m\u0393\n,\n(s \u2212 m2 + \u03932 /4)2 + m2 \u03932\n5\n\n(15)\n\n\fwhere f 3 = h\u03a9|Os |0++ i is the coupling of the lowest resonance to the scalar glueball current\nEq. (2). Recall the threshold behavior for \u03c1had (s)\nf 3 \u2192 \u03bb0 s,\n\nfor s \u2192 0,\n\n(16)\n\nwhich is deduced from a low-energy theorem [4, 38, 56]. The early QCD sum rule approach\nhad often used f 3 \u2192 \u03bb0 s in the whole lowest resonance region, however the obtained mass\nscale is too low to be expected in comparison with the lattice QCD results. In fact, the\nthreshold behavior (16) is only proven to be valid in the chiral limit; it may not be extrapolated far away. Therefore, instead of considering the coupling f as a constant [25], we choose\na model for f as\n\u001a\n\u03bb0 s,\nfor s < m2\u03c0\n3\n,\n(17)\nf =\n\u03bb0 m2\u03c0 + \u03bb3 , for s \u2265 m2\u03c0\n\nwhere \u03bb0 and \u03bb are some constants determined late in numerical simulation, so that the\nspectral function \u03c1had (s) has the almost complete Breit-Wigner form with correct threshold behavior, and in cooperation with the threshold behavior which is important for the\nconvergence of the corresponding integral. In Eq. (17), the constant \u03bb is invoked for the\ndiscontinuity at the chiral symmetry breaking.\nAlthough glueballs are well defined in quarkless QCD, the mixing with mesons makes the\nphenomenological side more complicated in full QCD; all scalar hadron states having a glue\ncontent should be interpolated by the gluonic current, and then present in the correlator\nwith different couplings. In Refs. [7\u20139, 34\u201336], the glueball is shared between the three scalar\nhadrons. These three hadrons are very close in mass; the assumption of single resonance\nmaybe be not appropriate. The form of the spectral function for three resonances we will\nuse is taken to be\n3\nX\nfi6 mi \u0393i\nhad\n\u03c1 (s) =\n,\n(18)\n(s \u2212 m2i + \u03932i /4)2 + m2i \u03932i\ni=1\n\nwhere all fi have the form shown in (17) with the same \u03bb0 , because \u03bb0 is fixed to be 5\nGeV by the low-energy theorem of QCD, and so that its value is independent of what an\nindividual resonance considered.\nIV.\n\nFINITE-WIDTH GAUSSIAN SUM RULES\n\nA family of Gaussian sum rules can also be constructed from the Borel transformation of\nthe correlation function in Eq.

In doing so, the value of \u015d should\napproximately be set to be the corresponding mass squared of the resonance m2 . To suppress\nthe continuum contribution, we require \u015d \u2264 m2 . The conditions for determining the value of\ns0 are: first, it should be grater than m2 ; and second, it should guarantee that there exists a\nsum rule window for our Gaussian sum rules. We note that the upper limit \u03c4max of the sum\nrule window is determined by requiring that the contribution from the continuum should be\nless than that of the resonance\nGkcont (s0 ; \u015d, \u03c4max ) \u2264 GkQCD (s0 ; \u015d, \u03c4max ),\n\n(34)\n\nwhile the lower limit \u03c4min of the sum rule window is obtained by requiring the contribution of\npure instantons to be greater than 50% of GkQCD (s0 ; \u015d, \u03c4 ), because such classical contributions\nshould be dominant in the low-energy region.

Even so, at the first step as comparison, we still consider\nonly the lowest resonance in the 0++ channel for the case of QCD with three massless quarks\nas usual for the scalar glueball mass m of about 600 MeV, because that resonance f0 (600)\nmay be considered to be well isolated. The optimal parameters governing the sum rules are\nlisted in Table II. The corresponding curves for the left-hand side and right-hand side of\n(19) of k = \u22121, 0 and, +1 are displayed in Fig.2.

The correlation function is calculated in a semiclassical expansion, a\nwell-defined process justified in the path-integral quantization formalism, of QCD in the\ninstanton background, namely the instanton liquid model of the QCD vacuum. Besides\nthe contributions from pure gluons and instantons separately, the one arising from the\ninteractions between the classical instanton fields and the quantum gluon ones are taken\ninto account as well. Instead of using the usual zero-width approximation for the spectral\nfunction of the considered resonances, the Breit-Wigner form for the resonances with a\ncorrect threshold behavior is adopted. With the QCD standard input parameters, three\nGaussian sum rules with the k = \u22121, 0, and 1-th moments are carefully studied.\nFor the quarkless QCD, we have,in fact, changed the value of \u015d, and found that the value\nof the mass of the lowest resonance is approximately proportional to \u015d, and the value of s0\narrives almost at its maximum for \u015d lying between 1.50 GeV2 and 1.70 GeV2 , where the\ncouplings to the state are almost the same for different k, and the corresponding widths\nbecome small and stable. We have only shown the situation with the optimal compatibility.\nWe note here that the value of \u03b4 for m = 650 MeV is one or two-orders lower than the\noptimal one, and the values of f are not coincident for different k, so that the mass scale\nof the lowest 0++ scalar glueball may not be lower than 1 GeV. The mass and width of the\nlowest glueball without quark loop corrections are predicted in Eq. (36).\n15\n\n\fFor QCD with three massless flavors and by considering only single scalar resonance, the\nsame behavior with respect to the changing of \u015d appears. Namely, the value of the mass of\nthe resonance is approximately proportional to \u015d, and the value of s0 arrives almost at its\nmaximum for \u015d lying between 1.35 GeV2 and 1.70 GeV2 , where the couplings to the state\nare almost the same for different k, and the corresponding widths become small and stable.\nWhen \u015d = 1.702 GeV2 (the situation with optimal compatibility), all physical parameters are\nalmost the same for different k. We note here that the value of \u03b4 for m = 650 MeV is nearly\none order lower than the optimal one, and the values of f are not coincident for different k\nas in the case of pure QCD, so that the mass scale of the lowest 0++ scalar glueball, even\nin the world of QCD with massless quarks, may not be lower than 1 GeV. The mass and\nwidth of the lowest glueball with quark loop corrections under the assumption of no mixture\nbetween glueball and q q\u0304 state are predicted in Eq. (39).\nFor QCD with three massless flavors and by considering three closely located 0++ scalar\nresonances f0 (1370), f0 (1500), and f0 (1710) (namely both \u015d and the resonance masses are\ngiven input parameters), the behavior with respect to the changing of \u015d is changed. Namely,\nthe values of the widths and s0 for the three resonances remain as almost invariant, and\nonly their couplings slightly increase when increasing \u015d. The optimal compatibility is arrived\nat \u015d = 1.352 GeV2 , as shown in Table III and Fig.3. The widths of the lowest three 0++\nresonances coupled to the glueball current Os are predicted in (40), from which we can read\noff the corresponding couplings f 3 to the three resonances f0 (1370), f0 (1500), and f0 (1710)\nwith masses 1.35, 1.47, and 1.70 GeV as\n0.95 \u00b1 0.47 GeV3 , 3.92 \u00b1 0.85 GeV3 , 1.42 \u00b1 0.51 GeV3 ,\n\n(43)\n\nrespectively.\nIn summary, we may conclude that, first, any 0++ scalar resonance below 1 GeV, such\nas f0 (600), contains almost no component of the scalar glueball; second, the values of the\nmass and decay width of the 0++ resonance, in which the fraction of the scalar glueball\nstate is dominant, are m = 1.50 \u00b1 0.10 GeV and \u0393 = 0.10 \u00b1 0.06 GeV, respectively, and\n3\n3\nthe value of its coupling to the corresponding current is fs\u2265m\n2 = 3.92 \u00b1 0.85 GeV ; third,\n\u03c0\nthe fractions of the scalar glueball contained in the other nearby 0++ scalar resonances,\nf0 (1370) and f0 (1710), are also appreciable. These are not only compatible with lattice\nQCD simulation [14\u201318] and other estimations [23\u201325, 29, 61], but also in good accordance\nwith the experimental data of the low scalar resonances [34\u201336].\nIt is also remarkable that the three Gaussian sum rules lead to almost the same results,\na consistency between the subtracted and unsubtracted sum rules is very well justified.\nWe note that we have not been working within the mixed scheme, namely with including\ncondensates, and in the same time, adopting the so-called direct-instanton approximation,\nbut simply with a self-consistent framework, a quantum theory in a classical background,\nwithout the problem of double counting. In this aspect, our results further justified the\ninstanton liquid model for QCD among many other justifications.\nIn our semiclassical expansion, the leading contribution to the sum rules comes from\ninstantons themselves, especially in the region below the threshold s0 . It is the amount of\nthis contribution that determines the low bound of the sum rule window. This means that\nthe nonlinear configurations of gluons have a dominant role with respect to the quantum\nfluctuations in the low-energy region.\nThe contribution of the interactions between the classical instanton fields and quantum\ngluon ones, considered in this paper but neglected in earlier sum rule calculations [23, 24, 27\u2013\n16\n\n\f29], is in fact not negligible. To the contrary, its amount is approximately double or even\ntriple that from the pure quantum fluctuations in the whole fiducial domain, expected from\na view point of the semiclassical expansion. Moreover, it is obviously seen from Figs. 1-3\nthat, without taking the contribution from the interactions between instantons and quantum gluons into account, the departures between Gkhad (s0 ; \u015d, \u03c4 ) and GkQCD (s0 ; \u015d, \u03c4 ) without\ninteraction become large, and all three Gaussian sum rules become less stable, and thus less\nreliable.\nFinally, it should be noticed that the imaginary part of the instanton contribution is an\noscillating, amplifying and nonpositive defined function, and so is the imaginary part of the\ncorrelation function. This property which is a fatal problem for the QCD sum rule calculation\nwith the instanton background, may make the contribution of continuum too large to be\nunder control. Hilmar Forkel introduced a Gaussian distribution for the instanton to get rid\noff this trouble, and obtained a smaller 0++ mass scale: 1.25 \u00b1 0.2 GeV [23] compared to\nthe earlier result 1.53 \u00b1 0.2 GeV [24]. We did not use this Gaussian distribution, but simply\nchose a smaller fitting parameter to avoid this problem.\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe are grateful to Prof. H. G. Dosch for useful discussions.
