The resulting model was expressed as a sum over fermionic\nloops throughout the spinfoam which were then coupled to the quantum geometry via grasping\noperators [2, 3]. This yielded vertex amplitudes in the state sum given by modified 6j symbols\nincorporating the presence of matter fields. While various other methods of coupling matter to\nspinfoam models have been proposed, for example [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], the simplicial formalism\nused here, and in [11, 12, 13], has very clear links to the classical action and closely resembles\ngauge theory on a random lattice [14].\nIn this paper, we firstly extend the framework of the original proposal to massless fermions.\nThis will turn out to clarify, and simplify the calculation. Motivated by recent interest in the\ngraviton propagator [15, 16, 17, 18], we then show how to compute the fermion propagator and\na few other simple observables. This requires a careful analysis of the symmetries of the system\nand a proper gauge fixing. We then integrate out the fermions using a different, more straight\nforward technique than in the original proposal. This procedure expands the observables into\nFeynman diagrams which, we show, naturally couple to the quantum geometry.\nThe organisation of the paper proceeds as follows. In section 2, we recall the proposed\ncoupling of fermions. In section 3 we perform the integrations in the path integral and arrive\nat spin foam models or spin network diagrams for the various observables. In section 4 we\ndemonstrate the techniques by considering some simple examples. The Appendix provides\nsome useful facts on the representation theory of SU(2).\n\u2217 richard.dowdall@maths.nottingham.ac.uk\n\u2020 winston.fairbairn@uni-hamburg.de\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nClassical theory\n\nLet M be a connected, oriented, compact, three-dimensional differential manifold endowed\nwith an Euclidean metric g with diagonal form \u03b7 = (+ + +). The relevant symmetry group is\nthe spin group associated to the Euclidean metric \u03b7, that is, the Lie group Spin(3) \u223c\n= SU(2).\nWe will assume that the manifold M is endowed with a given spin structure, i.e. a SU(2)principal bundle P\u0302 mapped with a two-to-one bundle homomorphism onto the SO(3) bundle\nof g-orthonormal frames P over M . Note that the principal bundle P\u0302 is necessarily trivial.\nHence, we will choose once and for all a global trivialising section.\nSince we are focusing on fermions, we will work in the spinor representation of 3d gravity.\nTo this aim, we define the linear map \u03b3 : R3 \u2192 End (C2 ), mapping the Clifford algebra C(3, 0)\n(in which the (dual of the) vector space R3 is embedded) onto the Pauli algebra, i.e., the\nendomorphism algebra of the two-dimensional complex vector space V \u2261 C2 . In fact, we will\nthink of the linear map \u03b3 as taking value in the Lie algebra su(2) of traceless, anti-Hermitian\nmatrices instead of the true Pauli algebra (traceless, Hermitian matrices).\nThe dynamical fields of the bosonic sector of the theory are the image e = \u03b3(e) = ea \u03b3a ,\na = 1, 2, 3, of the soldering form e on P under the map \u03b3, and a principal connection on\nthe spin bundle P\u0302, that is, a spin connection \u03c9 = 2i \u03c9 a \u03c3a , where the symbols \u03c3a denote the\nPauli matrices and the symbols \u03b3a = 2i \u03c3a generate the Lie algebra su(2). The fields of the\nfermionic sector of the theory consist of a 2-component Dirac fermion \u03c8 which is a section of\nthe spinor bundle, that is, the vector bundle E = P\u0302 \u00d7\u03c1 V associated to P\u0302 via the fundamental\nrepresentation \u03c1 of the spin group Spin(3) on V, and its Dirac conjugate \u03c8\u0304 = \u03c8 \u2020 , where the\ndagger \u2020 denotes Hermitian conjugation.\n\n2.1\n\nSimplicial theory\n\nIn order to regularise the functional integrals that would be used in a formal path integral\napproach to quantisation, we now introduce a cut-off on the number of degrees of freedom of\nthe theory by using lattice-like methods.\nThe so-called triangulation conjecture (or Hauptvermutung) states that all topological\nthree-manifolds admit a piece-wise linear structure. In other words, all three-dimensional\nmanifolds are triangulable. Accordingly, we can choose a fixed triangulation \u2206 of the spacetime\nmanifold M and discretise the fields accordingly. To this aim, we will also need to consider\nthe two skeleton \u03ba = (v, e, f ) of the topological dual \u2206\u2217 of the triangulation \u2206, that is, the\ncomplex formed by the vertices v, edges e and faces f of \u2206\u2217 . More precisely, we will work with\nthe derived complex \u2206+ obtained by refining the dual triangulation \u2206\u2217 by subdividing the\ndual faces f into wedges w (see [19] and references therein). The edges of the derived complex\n\u2206+ (which include the half-edges of \u2206\u2217 ) will be denoted \u0113. We will choose an orientation\ntogether with a distinguished vertex for each wedge. The orientation of the wedges naturally\ninduces an orientation of the boundary edges. This prescription is necessary to have a well\ndefined model, but the end results will be completely independent of these choices.\nWe finally assume that the global trivialising section of P\u0302 is piecewise constant in each\ntetrahedron of \u2206. Hence, the spinor and vector bundles associated to P\u0302 are also globally\ntrivialised by a piecewise constant section and we have a copy SU(2)v of the group SU(2), and\n\u2217\ncopies Vv , Vv of the vector space V, together with its dual complex conjugate vector space\n\u2217\nV , above each vertex v of \u2206\u2217 . We therefore have a basis (\u03b3a (v))a of su(2), a basis (eA (v))A\n\u2217\nof V and a basis (eA (v))A of V for each tetrahedron, or equivalently for each dual vertex v of\n\u2206\u2217 , inside which the vector and spinor fields are globally defined.\nSimplicial fields. The fields are discretised in the standard way, namely by using their\ngeometrical nature to assign values to the elements of the cellular complexes defined above.\nThe (spin space) frame field e, as a one form, maps the one-simplices s of \u2206 in su(2). Each\nsuch one-simplex is topologically dual to a face f of \u2206\u2217 , and the wedges of f are in one-to-one\ncorrespondence with the tetrahedra sharing the one-simplex s. Accordingly, it makes sense\nto assign the discretised co-frame to the wedges : ew = eaw \u03b3a (v), where eaw := ea (s) denotes\nthe components of the image in R3 of the tangent space vector s, measured with respect to\nthe frame attached to the dual vertex v associated to the wedge w. Hence, for a given face\nf , the wedge variables represent the same vector measured in different frames. Accordingly,\n\n2\n\n\fthese variables are related 1 by a connection matrix in SU(2) (image in spin space of a SO(3)\nrotation).\nR\nThis matrix ge , the holonomy P exp e \u03c9 of the connection along the corresponding edge e,\nis the discretised connection and is assigned to all edges of the derived complex \u2206+ . Reversing\n\u2020\nthe orientation of an edge maps the associated group element into its inverse\nQ : ge\u22121 = ge .\nFinally, the curvature around a wedge w is measured by the holonomy Gw = \u0113\u2208\u2202w g\u0113 of the\nconnection around w, by virtue of the Ambrose-Singer theorem. The matrix product is taken\nstarting from the distinguished vertex and in the ordering induced by the orientation of the\nwedge.\nThe fermionic fields, as sections of the spinor bundle, assign a spinor \u03c8v and a co-spinor\n\u03c8\u0304v to each vertex v of the dual triangulation. More precisely, to encompass the appropriate\nstatistics, the components of the simplicial \u0010fermions \u0011\n\u03c8vA , \u03c8\u0304vA are chosen to define a generating\nL \u2217\nV\nE\nE associated to the triangulation \u2206, with\nsystem of the Grassmann algebra G\u2206 =\n\u2217\n\n\u2217\n\nE = \u2295v Vv and E = \u2295v Vv .\n\nSimplicial action. With the fields defined above, the discretised action for the fermion/gravity\nsystem is the the sum of the Dirac action and an action for the gravitational field. To define\nthe fermionic action, we first introduce the simplicial Dirac operator assigned to the edges of\nthe dual triangulation:\nDe = \u03a3e Ue \u2212 Ue \u03a3e\u22121 ,\n(1)\nwhere Ue := U (ge ) is the holonomy of the connection along the edge e in the spinor representation, and \u03a3e is the discretised version of the two-form \u03a3 = e \u2227 e. It is evaluated on the\ninfinitesimal triangles of \u2206 dual to the edges of \u2206\u2217 and defined as\n\u03a3e =\n\n1 X\newe ewe\u2032 sgn(we , we\u2032 ),\n3\n\u2032\n\n(2)\n\nwe ,we\n\nwhere the sum is taken over the three possible pairs (without counting the permutations) of\nwedges meeting on the edge e and on the vertex s(e), and the factor sgn(we , we\u2032 ) equals \u00b11\ndepending on the sign of the associated (coordinate) area bivector. The spinor components\nare measured with respect to the spin frame associated to the source vertex s(e) of the edge e.\nThe Dirac action yields\nSD [ew , ge , \u03c8 v , \u03c8v ] =\n\n1 XX\nSe ,\n8\ne\n\n(3)\n\nor(e)\n\nwhere the sum is taken over all orientations or(e) of all edges e of \u2206\u2217 , and\nSe = (\u03c8s(e) , De \u03c8t(e) ),\n\n(4)\n\nwith s(e) and t(e) respectively denoting label the source and target vertices of the edge e in\nthe corresponding orientation, and the inner product (, ) being the standard Hermitian inner\nA\nproduct on C2 ., i.e., introducing a basis of C2 , (\u03be, \u03c7) = \u03be A \u03c7B \u03b4B\n.\nThe gravitational action is given by\nSGR [ew , g\u0113 ] =\n\n1 X\ntr (ew Gw ) ,\n16\u03c0G w\n\n(5)\n\nwhere the trace is in the spinor representation.\nIt was proven in [1] that the action for the coupled system SGR-D = SGR + SD converges\npoint-wise towards the continuum Einstein-Cartan-Dirac action when the lattice spacing goes\nto zero.\n1 Note this is not related to the flatness of the connection ; the vector attached to the one-simplex is in\nthe orthogonal complement of the dual face and is accordingly unaffected by the rotation associated to the\nholonomy around the face.\n\n3\n\n\fDiscrete symmetries. The introduction of a fixed background simplicial structure on M\nhas broken the diffeomorphism invariance of the continuum theory (see [20] for a detailed\ndiscussion of these issues). Unlike the pure gravity case, the diffeomorphisms can not be\nrecovered by a combination of gauge transformations because the introduction of fermions has\nbroken the topological character of pure 3d gravity. The expectation values of observables will\ntherefore be diffeomorphism covariant as opposed to invariant. The diffeomorphism invariance\nshould be recovered in the continuum limit with some appropriate renormalisation as in lattice\ngauge theory.\nHowever, the discretisation procedure has not broken the local SU(2) symmetry. The\narbitrariness in the choice of a basis of su(2) and of V at each dual vertex v is reflected\nin the invariance of the simplicial action under the following discrete gauge transformations\nparameterized by an SU(2)-valued sequence k : {v} \u2192 SU(2):\new\nGw\n\n7\n\u2192\nkv\u22121 ew kv\n7\u2192 kv\u22121 Gw kv ,\n\n(6)\n\nfor the bosonic part SGR of the action, and\nge\n\u03a3e\n\u03c8v\n\u03c8v\n\n\u22121\n7\u2192 ks(e)\nge kt(e)\n\n\u22121\n7\u2192 ks(e)\n\u03a3e ks(e)\n\n7\u2192 kv\u22121 \u03c8v\n\n7\u2192 \u03c8 v kv ,\n\n(7)\n\nfor the fermionic sector SD . In the first two lines, (6), the transformation acts on the variables\nassigned to all wedges w containing the vertex v, while the transformation (7) takes place on\nall edges e of \u2206\u2217 .\nFinally, note that the Dirac matrix D enjoys the following antisymmetry property:\nDeAB = \u2212DeBA\n\u22121 ,\n\n(8)\n\nwhere the indices have been raised and lowered with the standard symplectic metric \u01ebAB on\nC2 . Our conventions are the following. The two-dimensional totally antisymmetric tensor is\nC\nnormalised such that \u01eb01 = \u01eb01 = +1, which implies that \u01ebAB \u01ebBC = \u2212\u03b4A\n. The raising and\nlowering of indices occurs according to\n\u03c7A = \u01ebAB \u03c7B , and \u03beA = \u03be B \u01ebBA = \u2212\u01ebAB \u03be B .\n\n(9)\n\nThis implies in particular the following property for multi-component spinors\n...A...\nM ...A...\n.\n...A... = \u2212M...A...\n\n(10)\n\nSimplicial observables. In this paper, we are interested in the study of simplicial fermionic2\nobservables Of,\u2206 := Of , that is, polynomial functions of the simplicial fermion fields. In\nparticular, we will study the following observables\n\u2022 Of AB (x, y) = \u03c8xA \u03c8\u0304yB : the gauge-variant two-point function of the fermionic field.\n\u2022 Of (e) = (\u03c8s(e) , Ve \u03c8t(e) ), with e the path linking s(e) to t(e) and Ve the corresponding\nholonomy. We will call this gauge-invariant observable the Polyakov line.

According to a theorem in lattice gauge theory by Elitzur [22], the expectation value of a locally gauge dependent observable, such as the fermion two-point function, is\nzero without gauge fixing. This result is reproduced in the spinfoam formalism as the expectation value of a non-gauge fixed, locally gauge-dependent observable will result in spin network\nvertex amplitudes with a single open end which vanishes by Schur's Lemma (see equation (98)\nin the Appendix). It is therefore crucial to appropriately fix the above gauge freedom in the\nnaive expression (11). This can be achieved following the next lines [23, 5].\nThe idea is to introduce a maximal tree of the triangulation's dual T \u2282 \u2206\u2217 , that is, a\nsub-complex of the one-skeleton of \u2206\u2217 touching every vertex of \u2206\u2217 without ever forming a\nloop. One can pick an arbitrary preferred vertex r on T , called the root, and denote u the\nendpoints of the tree (recall that T is an open graph). We will note \u2206T the simplicial pair\n(\u2206, T ). Using this tree and the gauge invariance, it is possible to reach the gauge ge = 11\nfor all e in T . Remarkably, the Faddeev-Popov determinant associated to this gauge-fixing\nprocedure :\nYZ\nY\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u2206F P =\ndkv\n\u03b4(ks(e)\nge kt(e) ),\n(13)\nv\n\nSU(2)\n\ne\u2208T\n\nwith dk denoting the normalised Haar measure on SU(2), is equal to one [24, 5] because\n!\nZ\nYZ\nY\n\u22121\ndkr\n\u2206F P =\ndku\n\u03b4(kr\u22121 g\u03b3(u) ku ) = 1,\n(14)\nSU(2)\n\nu\n\nG\n\nu\n\nwhere \u03b3(u) is the unique path linking the endpoint u to the root of the tree.\nIf the observables are gauge-invariant, one simply follows the standard Faddeev-Popov\nprocedure associated to the above gauge-fixing prescription. If the observables are not gaugeinvariant, the situation is more involved. One procedure to compute a gauge-variant observables in lattice gauge theory involves averaging over the gauge group to define a gauge invariant\nfunction which can then be computed [25]. Alternatively, following Faddeev and Popov, one\ncan take the definition of a gauge dependent operator to include the necessary gauge fixing\n[26]\n! \u0012Z\n!\n\u0013 Y\nYZ\nYZ\n1\nhOf iGR-D = \u2206T\ndg\u0113\nd\u03bc(\u03c8 v , \u03c8v )\ndew\n\u03b4(ge ) Of eiSGR-D ,\nZGR-D w su(2)\nSU(2)\nG\n\u2206\n\u0113\ne\u2208T\n(15)\nwhere the normalisation factor is\nthe\npath\nintegral\n(12)\ngauge\nfixed\nby\nthe\ninsertion\nof\nthe\nQ\nsimplicial gauge fixing function e\u2208T \u03b4(ge ). For a gauge invariant operator, this reduces to\nequation (11), while it defines the expectation value for a gauge-variant observable. One can\nshow that the expectation values of gauge invariant observables are independent of the choice\nof gauge fixing tree T . The gauge variant observables necessarily depend on the choice of tree.\nThis describes the classical simplicial theory. We can now proceed to the quantum computations. Indeed, having reduced the number of degrees of freedom from infinite to finite by\nthe introduction of a discretisation scheme, we can now compute the integrals and accordingly\naccess the quantum aspect of the simplicial theory.\n\n5\n\n\f3\n\nQuantum theory\n\nTo compute the integrals in (15), the idea is to first integrate out the fermionic degrees of\nfreedom, in other words, perform a Feynman diagram expansion of the matter sector, before\ncomputing the gravitational integrals. As a result, hOf iGR-D is expressed as the expectation\nvalue of a bosonic observable Ob of the pure quantum gravity theory :\n!\n!\nYZ\nYZ\nY\n1\nhOf iGR-D =\ndew\ndg\u0113\n(16)\n\u03b4(ge ) Ob eiSGR .\nZGR-D w su(2)\nSU(2)\n\u0113\ne\u2208T\n\nTherefore, the expectation value of a fermionic observable can be written\nhOb iGR\n,\nhdet DiGR\n\n(17)\n\n\u0013\nd\u03bc(\u03c8 v , \u03c8v ) Of eiSD ,\n\n(18)\n\nhOf iGR-D =\nwhere\nOb =\n\n\u0012Z\n\nG\u2206\n\nand, using the fact that the Dirac action SD is an element of\n\u0012Z\n\nG\u2206\n\nV2 \u0010 L \u2217 \u0011\nE ,\nE\n\n\u0013\nd\u03bc(\u03c8 v , \u03c8v ) eiSD = det D.\n\nThe next step is to expand the bosonic observables Ob in fermionic paths.\n\n3.1\n\nFeynman diagram expansion\n\nThe advantage of first performing the matter integrals is that the Feynman diagrams define,\nas mentioned above, pure quantum gravity observables that naturally couple to the dynamical\ngeometry. The essence of the expansion relies on the properties of the Berezin integral. The\ntechniques used here are different than the ones introduced in [1], which relied on the introduction of symplectic Majorana fermions. Here, we explicitly integrate over the Dirac fields\nwhich offers a more direct way to compute the integrals.\nThe first step consists in Taylor expanding the exponential of the Dirac action. We use the\nfact that each term in the sum (3) is an even element of the Grassmann algebra, that is, has\noverall bosonic statistics Se Se\u2032 = Se\u2032 Se , for all couples of edges e, e\u2032 , and that the expansion is\nfinite because (Se )N = 0, for all edges e and all N > 2. This leads to the following expansion\nof (18)\n\u0012Z\n\u0013\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\nY\u0012\n\u03b12\n\u03b12\n2\n2\nOb =\nd\u03bc(\u03c8 v , \u03c8v ) Of\n1 + i\u03b1 Se \u2212\n1 + i\u03b1 Se\u22121 \u2212\n(Se )\n(S \u22121 ) , (19)\n2\n2 e\nG\u2206\ne\nwhere \u03b1 = 8(2\u03c0G)2 (we have rescaled the triad such that e 7\u2192 e/16\u03c0G). The above expansion\nproduces a finite but possibly large number of contributions. However, the number of terms\nsurviving the Berezin integral is drastically reduced.\nBeing a derivation, the Grassmann integral yields a non-zero result only if the integrand\nis the top form on G\u2206 , or in other words, if for each vertex v of \u2206\u2217 , there is a product of two\nnon-identical spinor and two non-identical co-spinor components.\nConsider first the vertices where there are no field insertions. The edge action Se appearing\nin the expansion has a co-spinor (resp. a spinor) siting at the source (resp. target) of the edge\ne. Hence, the only contributions surviving the integration are such that, for each such vertex\nv, there is a product of four edge actions Se such that v is exactly a source vertex for two edges\nand a target vertex for the two other edges. Note that the four edges need not be distinct.\nTo integrate such contributions, we firstly consider the Berezin integral for the Grassmann\nalgebra associated to a single vertex. Dropping the vertex label for a moment, it is easy to\nprove the following identity\nZ\n(20)\nd\u03bc(\u03c8, \u03c8) \u03c8 A \u03c8 B \u03c8 C \u03c8 D = \u2212\u01ebBD \u01ebAC .\n6\n\n\fIf one implements this formula at a vertex v satisfying the requirements discussed above, it\nis immediate to see that the integration connects, via the symplectic metric, the indices of\nthe Dirac matrices De (appearing in the edge actions Se ) associated to the edges meeting at\nv pairwise : the two matrices associated to the two ingoing edges are paired together and\nlikewise for the two matrices corresponding to the two outgoing edges. This implies that two\nmatrices being connected are necessarily associated to edges having opposite orientations. The\nsymplectic metric raises (resp. lowers) the second (resp. first) index of one of the two ingoing\n(resp. outgoing) matrices. This index then gets contracted with the first (resp. second) index\nof the other ingoing (resp. outgoing) matrix. The orientation of the edge associated to the\nmatrix with raised (resp. lowered) indices is flipped using the symmetry (8) for the orientation\nof the edges to be consistent with the matrix product. Therefore, the Berezin integral at vertex\nv yields two products of Dirac matrices (one for the ingoing and one for the outgoing edges)\nwith consistent orientation of the associated edges. Repeating the procedure for each vertex\nwith no field insertion will accordingly produce products of closed sequences of Dirac matrices\nassociated to edges forming loops in the dual triangulation \u2206\u2217 . The number of Dirac matrices\nappearing in each such sequence will necessarily be even because the matrices getting paired\nare associated to edges with opposite orientation.\nLet now v be a vertex with a fermionic field insertion. If a spinor (resp. a co-spinor)\ncomponent is inserted on a vertex v, one only requires another spinor (resp. co-spinor) component and two co-spinor (resp. spinor) components to saturate the vertex. Therefore, the\ncontributions surviving the integral are the following. For each vertex v where a spinor (resp.\na co-spinor) is inserted, there is a product of three edge actions Se where the corresponding\nedges, which again are not necessarily distinct, are such that v is exactly a target for one edge\n(resp. two edges) and a source for the other two edges (resp. for the other edge). This implies\nthat for each spinor (resp. co-spinor) insertion, there must be also a co-spinor (resp. spinor)\ninsertion on some other vertex to obtain a non-vanishing result.\nThe integration at a vertex v where a spinor (resp. co-spinor) is inserted then connects\nthe two Dirac matrices associated to the two outgoing (resp. ingoing) edges as before, but\nthe Dirac matrix corresponding to the ingoing (resp. outgoing) edge is left open with a free\nsecond (resp. first) index corresponding to the index assigned to the spinor (resp. co-spinor)\ninsertion. The other index of the open Dirac matrix gets connected at one of the adjacent\nvertices with another matrix and, using the orientation flip (8), we obtain a product of Dirac\nmatrices along an open oriented sequence of edges which starts (resp. terminates) at v and\nterminates (resp. starts) where another field insertion given by a co-spinor (resp. spinor) has\noccurred. This path is necessarily supported by an odd number of edges.\nTherefore, the result of the Berezin integral with p spinor and p co-spinor insertions on the\nvertices x1 , ..., x2p of \u2206\u2217 can be stated as follows. The following applies for observables with at\nmost a single field insertion on each vertex, but can be trivially extended to higher insertions.\nEach non-vanishing contribution is labelled by a graph \u0393(x1 , ..., x2p ). This graph is the union\nof 1) a union of oriented loops L with 2) a union of p oriented open paths P connecting the p\nvertices with spinor insertions to the p vertices with co-spinor insertions.\nThis graph is such that\n1. It has overall length3 E\u0393 given by 2n \u2212 p\n2. The length EL of each connected loop component L is even, while the length EP of each\npath components P is odd\n3. Each vertex v of the dual triangulation \u2206\u2217 is either traversed twice by the edges of \u0393,\neither traversed once if v admits a field insertion, i.e., if v \u2208 {x1 , ..., x2p }\n4. Each open path P is oriented such that s(P) (resp. t(P)) is a vertex with a spinor (resp.\nco-spinor) insertion.\n5. Consecutive edges of the graph \u0393 cannot go back and forth along the same dual edge\ne \u2208 \u2206\u2217 unless that particular connected component of \u0393 is of length two.\nA graph satisfying all these properties will be called admissible.\nAll possible, admissible graphs can be obtained by the following graphical method. Draw\nall possible sets of arrows of cardinality 2n connecting all the vertices of the dual triangulation\n3 The\n\nlength of a graph is the number of edges of the dual triangulation supporting the graph.\n\n7\n\n\fsuch that each vertex without field insertion has exactly two ingoing and two outgoing arrows,\nwhile a vertex with a spinor (resp. co-spinor) insertion has two outgoing (resp. ingoing) and\none ingoing (resp. outgoing) arrow. For each such set of arrows, the corresponding admissible\ngraph is obtained by connecting at each vertex the ingoing arrows with the ingoing arrows and\nlikewise for the outgoing arrows. The vertices with field insertions will accordingly be sources\nor targets for open lines. The connection process flips the orientation of one of the two arrows\nbeing paired to obtain a consistent orientation. For example, on a simple four point lattice\nwith a field insertion \u03c81 \u03c8 2 , the connecting of the arrows occurs as follows\n4\n\n1\n\n1\n\n4\n\n2\n\n3\n\n\u21d2\n\nPSfrag replacements\n\nPSfrag replacements\n3\n\n2\n\nIt may seem that there is an ambiguity when choosing which arrow to flip; the two possible\nchoices correspond to the two possible orientations for the loops and paths. However, the two\ncontributions corresponding to the two possible orientations of a loop are in fact equal because\nof the orientation symmetry (8). For a path, the boundary data fixes the orientation such that\nthe path always starts at a spinor insertion and terminates at a co-spinor insertion. Thus,\nthere is no ambiguity.\nWe are now ready to establish a set of 'Feynman rules' to obtain the bosonic observables\nOb in terms of the fermionic ones Of . These rules are as follows.\n\u2022 Consider all possible admissible graphs determined by Of .\n\u2022 To each admissible graph \u0393(x1 , ..., x2p ), assign respectively to each open path P and to\neach closed loop L of \u0393(x1 , ..., x2p ) the ordered products of Dirac matrices De\nY\nY\nDP = (i\u03b1)EP\nDe ,\nDL = (i\u03b1)EL tr\nDe ,\ne\u2208P\n\ne\u2208L\n\nfollowing the orientation of the path P or the loop L to which they are associated.\n\u2022 Assign an global sign \u01eb\u0393(x1 ,...,x2p) = \u00b11 to each graph \u0393(x1 , ..., x2p ) which controls the\noverall sign appearing as a result of raising and lowering some of the indices with the\nsymplectic metric (see equation (9)), using the orientation antisymmetry (8), the 'see\nsaw' property (10), and rearranging the fermionic fields to compute the full Berezin\nintegral.\n\u2022 Sum over all such contributions:\nOb =\n\nX\n\n\u01eb\u0393(x1 ,...,x2p ) I\u0393(x1 ,...,x2p ) ,\n\n(21)\n\n\u0393(x1 ,...,x2p )\n\nwhere I\u0393(x1 ,...,x2p ) is the amplitude associated to the admissible graph \u0393(x1 , ..., x2p ) constructed from the above assignments, and, depending on the obervables, the holonomies\nVe appearing in the definition of Of .\nOne may wander if there are no numerical factors supplementing the signs in the rules\ndepicted above. The only factors to take into consideration are the 1/2 factors coming from\nthe quadratic terms in the Taylor expansion of the exponential. In fact, these factors cancel\nexactly the multiplicities of the contributions to which they are associated. Indeed, the 1/2\nfactors are associated to loops going back and forth along a single edge because they correspond\nto terms of the form (Se )2 in the Taylor expansion. But for each such term there is also a\ncontribution of the form (Se\u22121 )2 giving rise to exactly the same loop contribution which hence\nappears twice.\nUsing this framework, we can study the expectation value of all polynomial observables in\nthe fermion fields by computing the Berezin integrals according to the rules depicted above.\n\n8\n\n\fFirstly, we can consider the somewhat trivial case where there are no field insertions p = 0,\ni.e., the computation of the functional determinant det D. In this case, the open paths P are\nsimply reduced to the null graph and the admissible graphs are accordingly given by collections\nof closed loops which correspond to the terms of order 2n in the expansion parameter \u03b1. An\nexample is given by a single loop going through all the vertices of the triangulation twice.\nAnother example is provided by a chain-type graph given by a collection of length two loops\neach going back and forth between two adjacent vertices. The amplitude I\u0393 associated to a\nsuch admissible graph \u0393 is thus given by\nY\nI\u0393 =\nDL ,\n(22)\nL\n\nwhere the product is over all the loops L \u2282 \u0393. We therefore obtain that the functional\ndeterminant yields\nX Y\ndet D =\n\u01eb\u0393\nDL .\n(23)\n\u0393\n\nL\u2282\u0393\n\nWe can also compute the bosonic observable associated to the gauge-variant two-point\nfunction of the fermionic field\nOf AB (x1 , x2 ) = \u03c8xA1 \u03c8 x2 B .\nThe corresponding bosonic observable is defined by specifying the set of admissible graphs\n\u0393(x1 , x2 ) and the corresponding amplitudes I\u0393(x1 ,x2 ) . The admissible graphs are characterised\nby the fact that they contain one open path P(x1 , x2 ) going from x1 to x2 . An example is\ngiven by an open path and a single closed loop satisfying the admissibility requirements. The\namplitude associated to an admissible graph \u0393(x1 , x2 ) yields\n!\nY\nA\nA\n(24)\nI\u0393(x1 ,x2 ) B = DP(x1 ,x2 ) B\nDL .\nL\n\nNote that, for all admissible graphs \u0393, the above amplitude is of order 2n \u2212 1 in the expansion\nparameter \u03b1 = 8/m2p , where m2p = 1/2\u03c0G is the Planck mass. Therefore, since the two-point\nfunction is given by the quotient (17) of the expectation value of the above bosonic observable\nwith the expectation value of the functional determinant, it will be of mass dimension two as\nexpected for the three-dimensional fermion propagator in the spatial representation.\nThe bosonic observable corresponding to the gauge-invariant Polyakov line\nOf (e) = (\u03c8s(e) , Ve \u03c8t(e) ),\nis associated to the same type of admissible graphs as the two-point function because the field\ninsertions are of the same type. The corresponding amplitudes are given by the expression\n!\nY\nI\u0393(x1 ,x2 ) = tr Ve DP(x2 ,x1 )\n(25)\nDL\nL\n\nwhere P(x2 , x1 ) is a path connecting the endpoints x2 = t(e) to x1 = s(e) of the Polyakov\nline.\nAnother interesting observable is the two point function of the Polyakov line\nOf (e, e\u2032 ) = (\u03c8s(e) , Ve \u03c8t(e) ) (\u03c8s(e\u2032 ) , Ve\u2032 \u03c8t(e\u2032 ) ).\nIf x1 , x2 and x3 , x4 respectively label the source and target vertices of e and e\u2032 , the result of the\nintegration over the fermion fields is labelled by two types of admissible graphs \u0393(x1 , ..., x4 ).\nThe first type contains two open paths linking x2 to x1 and x4 to x3 . The corresponding\namplitude yields\n!\nY\n(26)\nI\u0393(x1 ,...,x4) = tr Ve DP(x2 ,x1 ) tr Ve\u2032 DP(x4 ,x3 )\nDL .\nL\n\n9\n\n\fThe second type of admissible graphs admit two open paths respectively linking x2 to x3 and\nx4 to x1 , and the corresponding amplitude follows\n!\nY\nI\u0393(x1 ,...,x4) = tr Ve DP(x2 ,x3 ) Ve\u2032 DP(x4 ,x1 )\n(27)\nDL .\nL\n\nThe above expression suggest that the amplitudes associated to both types of gauge invariant observables considered here can be written generically in the following form\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n!\nY Y\nY\nI\u0393 = \uf8ed tr\n(28)\nDP Ve(P) \uf8f8\nDL .\n\u03b3\n\nP\u2208\u03b3\n\nL\n\nHere, the first product is over all possible closed loops \u03b3 formed by composing the open paths\nP of the graph \u0393 with the edges e supporting the holonomies Ve defining the observable Of .\nThe edge e(P) denotes the edge e supporting the observable holonomy Ve which is such that\nt(e) = s(P).\nThe obtained amplitudes are not yet expressed as products of holonomies as one would\nexpect. In fact, all the above amplitudes are given by a sum over 2E\u0393 contributions since\neach Dirac matrix De is a sum of two terms (see equation (1)). All these contributions are\nassociated to the same graph \u0393 but vary by the pattern of the assignments of holonomies\nand simplical area two-forms to each edge of \u0393. We will call each such term a configuration\nassociated to the graph \u0393 and note it I\u0393c , with the parameter c \u2261 c(\u0393), ranging from 0 to\n2E\u0393 \u2212 1, labeling the configuration. An example of a such term can be obtained for each\nobservable given above by replacing the Dirac matrix De with the quantity \u03a3e Ue . Another\nconfiguration is obtained, for example, by assigning\nthe factor Ue \u03a3e\u22121 , instead of \u03a3e Ue , to one\nP\nof the edges. Hence, for each graph \u0393, I\u0393 = c I\u0393c and all bosonic observables will be written\nas a sum\nX\nOb =\n\u01eb\u0393 I\u0393c .\n(29)\n\u0393,c\n\nWe close this section on the fermionic integration with a remark. Interestingly, considering\nthe fermionic observable given by the top form\n\u0012 \u0013n Y\n1\n(\u03c8v , \u03c8v )2\nOf =\n2\nv\nleads to a bosonic obervable simply given by\nOb = \u00b11.\nThis implies that the expectation value of this observable is simply given by the ratio of the\nPonzano-Regge amplitude and the expectation value of the fermionic determinant. We now\nturn towards the integration over the quantum geometry fluctuations.\n\n3.2\n\nGravitational integrals\n\nWe have shown that the bosonic observable Ob corresponding to an arbitrary fermionic observable Of could be written as the finite sum (29), where I\u0393c = I\u0393c (ew , Ue ) As a result, the\nexpectation value of a fermionic observable Of can be written as a finite sum over spinfoams :\nhOf iGR-D =\n\nX\n1\n\u01eb\u0393 Ac\u0393 ,\nhdet DiGR\n\n(30)\n\n\u0393,c\n\nwhere the amplitude Ac\u0393 associated to the graph \u0393 and to the configuration c is given by\n!\n!\nY\nYZ\nX\nYZ\nc\nA\u0393 =\ndg\u0113\n\u03b4(ge ) I\u0393c (ew , Ue ) exp\ndew\ntr (ew Gw ) .\n(31)\nw\n\nsu(2)\n\n\u0113\n\nSU(2)\n\ne\u2208T\n\nw\n\nThe calculation of the observable now boils down to evaluating each term (31) appearing\nin the sum over spinfoams (30) in a similar way to evaluating Feynman diagrams in ordinary\n\n10\n\n\fquantum field theory. To this aim, we now need to perform the integration over the discretised\nframe field and holonomy variables.\nLet us take a closer look at the functional I\u0393c (ew , Ue ) associated to a particular term \u0393 in\nthe Feynman diagram expansion and to a particular configuration c. The amplitudes I\u0393c for all\nobservables considered here share the same structural properties : the functional I\u0393c (ew , Ue ) is\ngiven by products of terms of the form \u03a3e Ue or Ue \u03a3e\u22121 along the edges of the graph \u0393 which\ncan close or not. There can also be holonomy matrices Ve linking the open ends of the graph.\nWe therefore need to understand how to integrate the Dirac matrices and holonomy variables\nagainst the complex exponent of the gravity action. We start by considering the case of gauge\ninvariant observables (28).\n3.2.1\n\nGauge invariant observables\n\nTo calculate gauge invariant observables, we will use the fact that, because the Fadeev-Popov\ndeterminant is equal to one, the gauge group is compact and the Haar measures used in the\npath integral are normalised, the expectation\nvalue of a gauge invariant observable calculated\nQ\nby inserting the gauge fixing function e\u2208T \u03b4(ge ) in the path integral is equal to the expectation\nvalue obtained without the gauge fixing. Therefore, for the computation of gauge invariant\nobservables, we will simply omit the gauge fixing function.\nTo understand how to perform the gravity integrals, we will choose a particular configuration I\u0393c associated to an arbitrary graph \u0393 in the sum over configurations appearing in (28).\nIt will be sufficient to consider only one type of configurations as the techniques developed for\nthis particular case will equally apply to all other terms.

The Dirac matrices (1) involve holonomies and discretised area two-forms (2) which are quadratic in the simplicial triad field. To integrate\nover the wedge variables ew , the idea, borrowed from conventional quantum field theory, is\nto replace polynomial combinations of the discretised triad appearing in the path integral by\nsource derivatives [2, 3]\ni \u03b4\n,\new 7\u2192\n2 \u03b4Jw\nacting on an appropriate generating functional [1], where the sources Jw = Jwa \u03b3a represent\na Lie algebra valued two-form J discretised on the wedges w. The role of the free theory\nis played by the pure topological 3d gravity action. In this framework, the discretised area\ntwo-form \u03a3e = \u03a3ae \u03b3a appearing in the Dirac matrices becomes the differential operator\n\u03a3\u0302ae = \u2212\n\n\u03b4\n1 X abc \u03b4\n\u2032\n\u01eb\nc sgn(we , we ),\nb\n12\n\u03b4J\n\u03b4J\n\u2032\nw\nwe\n\u2032\ne\n\n(33)\n\nwe ,we\n\nand the amplitude (31) is re-writen as\n\uf8ee\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nYY Y\nA0\u0393 = (i\u03b1)E\u0393 \uf8f0\uf8ed\n\u03a3\u0302ae e \uf8f8\n\u03b3 P\u2208\u03b3 e\u2208P\n\nYY\n\nL e\u2208L\n\n\u03a3\u0302bee\n\n!\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n(a,b)\nA0\n(J)\n\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fb\n\n,\n\n(34)\n\nJ=0\n\nwhere the generating functional, after integration over the simplicial triad, is given by\n\uf8f6\n! \uf8eb\n!\nZ\nY\nY\nY\nY\nY\nY Y\n\u0001\n0 (a,b)\nA\u0393\n(J) =\ndg\u0113 \uf8ed tr\n\u03b3ae Ue Ve(P) \uf8f8\n\u03b4 eJw Gw\ntr\n\u03b3be Ue\n\u0113\n\nSU(2)\n\n\u03b3\n\nP\u2208\u03b3 e\u2208P\n\nL\n\ne\u2208L\n\nw\n\n(35)\nwhere (a, b) is a pair of cumulative indices such that a runs over all of the ae in each path P\nin \u03b3, and b runs over each be associated to each edge e of each loop configuration L. The delta\n11\n\n\ffunction, which appears because the action appearing in the generating functional is linear in\nthe simplicial triad, is assumed4 to be on the Lie group SU(2).\nThe next step consists of expanding the delta functions in terms of characters. Let j \u2208 N/2\nlabel the unitary, irreducible representations \u03c0 j : SU(2) \u2192 Aut Vj of the Lie group SU(2). The\nPeter-Weyl theorem states that\nX\ndim j\u03c7j (g),\n(36)\n\u2200g \u2208 SU(2), \u03b4(g) =\nj\u2208N/2\n\nwhere dim j = 2j + 1 is the dimension of the representation j and \u03c7j = tr \u03c0 j is the corresponding character. This step transfers the calculations to the arena of the representation theory\nof SU(2). The idea is then to expand the characters appearing in the generating functional\n(35) into products of matrix elements of the group variables associated to the boundary of\nthe wedges. The same group element then appears into a number of different representation\nmatrices and implementing the integrals over the simplicial connections then boils down to\nunderstanding how to integrate the tensor product of representations. All the formulae given\nin the following section are proved in the Appendix.\nGroup integrals. The group integrals are easier to understand with the aid of the graphical calculus of spin networks. The graphical methods offer the advantage of accurately performing representation theory calculations which would involve lengthy formulae if written\nalgebraically.\nA spin j representation matrix \u03c0 j evaluated on a group element g is depicted as an oriented\nline coloured by the spin j traversing a little circle corresponding to the group element g :\nj\nPSfrag replacements g\n\nThe trace of a such matrix is simply obtained by joining the two ends of the open line to form\na closed loop. If the group element is the identity, the circle is simply omitted which implies\nthat a spin j line without a circle is the identity operator on Vj . Each line comes with an\narrow, which is inherited from the orientation of the derived complex \u2206+ , and reversing the\narrow is equivalent to switching from a representation to its dual. Here it is assumed that,\nwhen no arrows are explicitly given, the orientation flows from the top to the bottom of the\ndiagram.\nThe Haar integral over g of a representation matrix \u03c0 j (g) is understood when the circle is\nreplaced by a rectangular box (a cable). Thus, the Haar integral of the tensor product of n\nrepresentation matrices with spins j1 , ..., jn evaluated on the same group element\nZ\n(37)\ndg \u03c0 j1 (g) \u2297 ... \u2297 \u03c0 jn (g),\nSU(2)\n\nis represented by a box in which the corresponding n lines enter and exit\nj1\n\n***\n\nPSfrag replacements\n\njn\n(38)\n\nA box defines an endomorphism of the tensor product of the corresponding representations\nwhich projects onto the trivial subrepresentation. Accordingly, the result of the integration\ncan be expressed in terms of intertwining operators. The diagrammatic representation of an\nintertwining operator \u03b9 of unit norm between the tensor product of n representations j1 , ..., jn\nand the complex numbers\n(39)\n\u03b9 \u2208 Hom(Vj1 \u2297 ... \u2297 Vjn , C),\n4 In fact, the naive procedure followed here yields [5] the delta function on SO(3) and not the one on SU(2).\nQ\nTo obtain the delta function on SU(2), one needs to insert the observable w 21 (1+ 12 tr Gw ) in the path integral\n[27]. In what follows, we will assume that this trick has been implemented and that we are thus working with\na delta function on the spin group.\n\n12\n\n\fis given by a vertex, or node (to avoid confusions with the vertices of the dual of the trianguPSfrag\nlation), with n ingoing\nlines: replacements\n***\nj1\njn\n(40)\n+\n\nFor this diagram to accurately describe an intertwining operator, one needs to specify an\nordering of the lines to match the order of the tensor product in the corresponding algebraic\nexpression. Our conventions are such that the order of the tensor product is read clock-wise\n(resp. anti-clock-wise) starting from the line marked with a bullet point if the vertex carries a\n+ sign (resp. a \u2212 sign). Therefore, the picture (40) is precisely the diagrammatic form of the\nintertwiner \u03b9 in (39). The reversal of one or more arrows in the above diagram would represent\nan intertwining operator between the tensor product of the representation associated to the\ningoing lines to the tensor product of the representation assigned to the outgoing lines.\nWe are now ready to perform the group integrals. There are three different types of Haar\nintegrals appearing in the amplitude depending on what type of edge the integration is assigned\nto. The first type is when the edge \u0113 belongs to the interior of a face f in which case it is shared\nby precisely two wedges and the corresponding group element thus appears in two characters.\nFor every such interior edge \u0113 in a given face f , we use the orthogonality of the characters\nZ\n\u03b4jk\n\u03c7j (g1 g2 ).\n(41)\ndg \u03c7j (g1 g)\u03c7k (g \u22121 g2 ) =\ndim\nj\nSU(2)\nDiagrammatically this is\nj\n\nk\n\nj\n1\n\u03b4jk g1\ng2 =\nPSfrag\nreplacements\ndim j\n\nPSfrag replacements g1\n\ng2\n\n.\n\n(42)\n\nImplementing the above formula repeatedly forces all the spins jw associated to wedges belonging to the same face f to be equal jw = jf for all w in f . The various powers of the\ndimension factors dim j = 2j + 1 appearing when performing the integrals combine with the\ndimension associated to each wedge by virtue of (36) and produce, for each face f , a weight\ngiven by (2jf + 1)\u03c7f where \u03c7f is the topological invariant Euler characteristic of the face f .\nFrom here on, we will assume that each face is homeomorphic to a disk and thus that \u03c7f = 1\nfor all f . The generating functional (35) thus reduces to\nXY\n0(a,b)\n0(a,b)\nA\u0393\n(J) =\ndim jf A\u0393\n(jf , J),\n(43)\njf\n\nf\n\nwith\n0(a,b)\nA\u0393\n(jf , J)\n\nYZ\n\n=\n\ne\n\n\u00d7\n\nY\nf\n\nSU(2)\n\ndge\n\n!\uf8eb\n\uf8ed\n\nY\n\ntr\n\n\u03b3\n\nY Y\n\nP\u2208\u03b3 e\u2208P\n\n\u0010 1\n\u0011\nm\n\u03c7jf eJf ge1f ... eJf gemf .\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\u03b3ae Ue Ve(P) \uf8f8\n\nY\nL\n\ntr\n\nY\n\ne\u2208L\n\n\u03b3be Ue\n\n!\n\n(44)\n\nHere, the source insertions Jfv are along all the vertices v of a given face f (m := mf denotes\nthe number of vertices, i.e the number of wedges contained in f ). The edges \u0113 of \u2206+ that we\nhave not integrated out, that is, the edges belonging to the boundaries of the faces f (which\nare half-edges of \u2206\u2217 ), have been recombined into edges e of \u2206\u2217 .\nTo calculate (44), we need to perform the remaining integrals which, as we have seen,\nare associated to edges of the dual triangulation \u2206\u2217 . The edges of the dual triangulation\nare shared by three dual faces. If a such edge e does not support an edge of the graph\n\u0393, the corresponding group element appears in three characters and the associated integral\ninvolves the tensor product of three representations. For every such edge we use repeatedly\nthe following formula\nZ\ndg \u03c0 i (g) \u2297 \u03c0 j (g) \u2297 \u03c0 k (g) = \u03b9 \u03b9\u2217 ,\n(45)\nSU(2)\n\n13\n\n\fwhere \u03b9 : Vi \u2297 Vj \u2297 Vk \u2192 C is the Wigner 3j map, while \u03b9\u2217 : C \u2192 Vi \u2297 Vj \u2297 Vk denotes the\ndual map. Introducing a basis (ej\u03b1 )\u03b1=\u2212j,..,j of Vj , the following evaluation\n\u0012\n\u0013\ni j k\n\u03b9(ei\u03b1 \u2297 ej\u03b2 \u2297 ek\u03b3 ) =\n,\n(46)\n\u03b1 \u03b2 \u03b3\nis the standard Wigner 3j symbol (see the Appendix for an account of our conventions). In\nthe diagrammatic language, the formula (45) reads\ni\nj\nk\nj\nk\ni\nPSfrag replacements\n=\nPSfrag replacements\n\n+\n\u2212\n\ni\n\nj\n\n(47)\nk\n\nNote that no marking of lines is required for three-valent intertwiners, we only need to specify\nan orientation of the vertex. This is because of the cyclic symmetry of the 3j symbols (see\nequation (84) in the Appendix).\nNote that we have only given the integration formula for the case where all three lines are\npointing in the same direction, from top to bottom. If one line coloured by, say spin k, is\npointing from bottom to top in equation (87), the formula must be corrected by multiplying\nthe right hand side by a phase given by (\u22121)2k . This factor is the norm (squared) of the\ncorresponding intertwiner. Since the Haar measure in invariant under the transformation\ng 7\u2192 g \u22121 , we now have covered all possible orientations configurations; if a line is pointing in\na direction opposite to the two others, we pick up a phase given by \u22121 to the power twice the\nspin colouring the line.\nNow, if an edge e does support an edge of the graph \u0393, the corresponding integral involves\nthe tensor product of the three representations assigned to the three wedges meeting on e but\nalso one (resp. two) fundamental j = 1/2 representation associated to the holonomy matrix\n(matrices) Ue appearing in the Dirac matrix (matrices) De attached to the edge e. If there is\nonly one spinor representation associated to e, the relevant formula to use is that of the tensor\nproduct of four representation matrices\nZ\nX\ndg U (g) \u2297 \u03c0 i (g) \u2297 \u03c0 j (g) \u2297 \u03c0 k (g) =\n(48)\n\u03b9s \u03b9\u2217s ,\nSU(2)\n\ns\n\nwhere the spin s labels a basis of the vector space of 4-valent intertwiners obtained by choosing\na recoupling scheme and decomposing the tensor product of two out of the four representations\nusing the Clebsch-Gordan intertwining maps (see Appendix). For instance, if we choose the\nrecoupling\n\u0011\nO\nM\u0010\nHom(Vi \u2297 Vj , Vs )\nHom(Vk \u2297 Vl , Vs\u2217 ) ,\nHom(Vi \u2297 Vj \u2297 Vk \u2297 Vl , C) =\ns\n\nfor arbitrary representations, the four-valent intertwiner \u03b9s is related to the 3j symbols by the\nfollowing evaluation\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u221a\ni j \u01eb\ns k l\ni j k l\nj\ni\nk\nl\n, (49)\n\u03b9s (e\u03b1 \u2297 e\u03b2 \u2297 e\u03b3 \u2297 e\u03b4 ) =\n= dim s\n\u03b1 \u03b2 s\n\u01eb \u03b3 \u03b4\n\u03b1 \u03b2 \u03b3 \u03b4 s\n\nwhere the indices are raised and lowered, i.e., the lines inside a given column are interchanged,\naccording to the convention displayed in the Appendix and summation over repeated indices is\nunderstood. One could obviously choose another recoupling of representations. The coefficient\nappearing in the change of basis between the chosen decomposition and the one given by a\ndifferent recoupling of representations is (proportional to) a six-j symbol (see equation (100)\nin the Appendix).\nIn the diagrammatic language, equation (48) yields\n1\n1\nj k\nj k replacements 21 i\ni PSfrag\ni j k\n2\n2PSfrag replacements\nPSfrag replacements\ns\nX\nX\n+\n+\n+s\n(50)\n=\n=\ndim\ns\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212s\ns\ns 1\ns\n1\n1s\n1\n1\nj k\nj\ni\nk\n2 i\n2\n14\n\n\fNote our convention in which the fundamental representations are represented by dashed lines.\nAs in the three-valent case, the formula would need to be corrected by a factor (\u22121)2l if the\nline of spin l was pointing in a direction opposite to the three others, and by a factor (\u22121)2(k+l)\nif the lines k and l where going in opposite directions with respect to the two others.\nThere can also be two fundamental j = 1/2 lines 5 associated to the edge e. The corresponding integral involves the tensor product of five representations and the relevant formula\nis\nZ\nX\ndg U (g) \u2297 U (g) \u2297 \u03c0 i (g) \u2297 \u03c0 j (g) \u2297 \u03c0 k (g) =\n\u03b9s,t \u03b9\u2217s,t ,\n(51)\nSU(2)\n\ns,t\n\nwhere the spins s, t now label two channels in a particular recoupling scheme. We will choose to\ncouple the two spinor representations together and likewise for the j and k representations. The\nfirst coupling gives rise to s while the second produces the label t. For general representations,\nbut under the same recoupling scheme, the five-valent intertwiner \u03b9s,t is also related to the 3j\nsymbol as follows\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u221a\ni j \u03bc\ns k \u03c3\nt l m\ni j k l m\n.

Their explicit expression depends on the observable, and thus on the graph \u0393.\nTypically, the vertex amplitudes are functions of the six spins and of the six sources assigned\nto the six wedges sharing the corresponding vertex. They are calculated by evaluating the\nrepresentations on the sources. The indices of the resulting matrices \u03c0 j (eJ ) are contracted with\nthe indices of the (three, four or five-valent) intertwiners issued from the Haar integrals. The\ntensor contraction pattern can be conveniently read out of the the diagrammatic representation\nof these amplitudes.\nThe spin network diagrams associated to the vertex amplitudes are all built out of four\nvertices, or nodes, and eight (possibly nine) lines. The nodes represent the intertwiners issued\nfrom the Haar integrations and six out of the eight lines correspond to the spins coloring the\nfaces, or wedges, meeting on the vertex v and contain a source insertion. The two (possible\nthree) remaining lines are in the fundamental representation and are associated to the two\nedges of the graph \u0393 traversing the vertex v, or to one (possibly two) edge of \u0393 and one edge\nsupporting the holonomy Ve defining the observable if v is a vertex with a fermionic field\n5 Note that there could also be cases where a given edge e is associated to three lines, two issued from the\ngraph \u0393 and one coming from a matrix Ve defining the gauge-invariant observable. In such cases, one uses the\nobvious generalisation of the above formulae.\n\n15\n\n\finsertion. Note that a matter line can form a loop based at a vertex if it is associated to an\nedge of \u0393. In addition, the matter lines in the spinor representations are marked with a vertex\nwith an open line\u221ain the adjoint representation colored by an adjoint index a or b, weighted\nby the number i 6/2, if they are associated to an edge of \u0393. This is because to the edges\ne of \u0393 are assigned the quantities \u03b3ae Ue (see e.g. (44)). Thus the holonomies are composed\nwith generators of su(2) in the spinor j = 1/2 representation. As explained below (56),\nsuch a generator is an unnormalised intertwiner between the adjoint representation, a spinor\nrepresentation and its dual and\n\u221a is thus represented diagrammatically by a vertex weighted by\nits norm, that is, the number i 6/2. This closes our state-sum representation of the generating\nfunctional. We are now ready to calculate the action of the source derivative in (34).\nGrasping operators. Deriving an exponentiated current in the j representation with respect to the a-th component of the source produces the evaluation of the su(2) generator \u03b3a\nin the Lie algebra representation j :\n\u03b4 j J\n\u03c0 (e )\n\u03b4J a\n\n= \u03c0\u2217j (\u03b3a ),\n\n(55)\n\nJ=0\n\nwhere \u03c0\u2217j is the Lie algebra representation induced by the group representation \u03c0 j .\nNow, the linear map \u03c0\u2217j : su(2) \u2192 End Vj commutes with the group action and is therefore\nan intertwining operator between the adjoint representation, a j representation and its dual\n\u03c0\u2217j\n\nHom(V1 , Vj \u2297 Vj\u2217 ).\n\n\u2208\n\n(56)\n\nThis interwiner is not normalised and its norm (squared) is easily evaluated to be \u0398(j)2 :=\n\u0398(1, j, j)2 = (\u22121)2j j(j + 1)(2j + 1). Diagrammatically, a Lie algebra representation is thus\nrepresented as\nPSfrag replacements1\nj\n+\n\u03c0\u2217j = \u0398(j)\n(57)\nj\nTherefore the action of source derivation with respect to the a-th component of the current,\nalso called grasping, modifies a spin network with source insertion by creating a new vertex\nattached to an open line coloured by the index a in the adjoint representation.\nWe can now readily see the action of the operator \u03a3\u0302ae associated to an edge e of the graph\n\u0393 in (34) on the vertex amplitude associated to the vertex which is the source of e taken at\nJ = 0. Each term in the sum over wedges in (33) marks each one of the two representation\nlines associated to the two wedges we and we\u2032 with a vertex attached to an open line. The\ntwo resulting open lines are coloured by the indices b and c in the adjoint representation.\nThese two lines, together with the open line associated to the edge e appearing in the vertex\namplitude, connect through the totally antisymmetric three dimensional Levi-Civita tensor\nPSfrag replacements\nregarded as 3j symbol\na b c\n1 1 1\n\u221a\n.\n(58)\n\u01ebabc = 6\n+\n\nThis is the explicit picture of the soldering of the spin space to the quantum geometry of\nspacetime. One must then sum over over all admissible wedges.\nFinally, the amplitude (34) associated to a graph \u0393 and to the chosen configuration c\u0393 = 0\nis thus given by an expression of the type\nYX\nYX\nAv (jf , sv ).\n(59)\ndjf\nA0\u0393 = (i\u03b1)E\u0393\nf\n\nv\n\njf\n\nsv\n\nHere, the sum over sv labels each of the elements of the bases of intertwiners for the intertwiners\nof valence greater than three appearing in the amplitude Av associated to the vertex v. A\nsum over graspings is implicitly assumed in the definition of the amplitude Av . Graphically,\nAv is given by a (sum over) spin network diagram(s) weighted by a function of the spins\nN (j) obtained by assigning the quantity (\u2212i/4)\u0398(jfe )\u0398(jfe\u2032 ) to each grasping occuring in\nthe diagram, and a phase factor (\u22121)\u03c7 , with \u03c7 the sum of all spins associated to the lines\n\n16\n\n\foriented differently from the other lines at each vertex of the diagram which is issued from\na Haar integration. All possible spin networks are given in Figure 1. Each one of these\ndiagrams can be expressed in terms of 6j symbols using the recoupling identities given in the\nAppendix. For a particular triangulation and a particular graph/configuration, the obtained\nvertex amplitudes are recoupled in the following section.\nThe extension to the other configurations c 6= 0 associated to the graph \u0393 is immediately\nobtained from the above derivation.\n3.2.2\n\nGauge dependent observables\n\nWhen computing gauge dependent observables, the essential difference with the gauge\nQinvariant\ncase comes from the fact that we can no longer suppress the gauge fixing function e\u2208T \u03b4(ge )\nfrom the computation if we do not want to obtain a vanishing expectation value. The resulting\ncalculation will therefore depend on the gauge, and thus on the tree T .\nAs in the gauge invariant case, we choose a particular configuration c = 0 associated to an\narbitrary graph \u0393. The corresponding general form of the amplitude to be integrated yields\n!\nYY\nY Y\n(60)\nI\u03930 (ew , Ue ) = (i\u03b1)E\u0393\n\u03a3e U e\ntr\n\u03a3e U e .\nP e\u2208P\n\nL\n\ne\u2208L\n\nAll the steps performed in the gauge invariant case for the calculation of A0 transfer\nunchanged to the gauge dependent context up to equation (44), which is now modified with\nthe inclusion of the gauge fixing function. After that, the derivation slightly differs from the\ngauge invariant case. The main consequence of the presence of the gauge fixing function is\nthat not all group variables are integrated over. Therefore, although all formulae for the Haar\nintegrals are implemented as in the gauge invariant case, the resulting generating functional\nat fixed spins (44) can not put into factorised form as in (54).\nTypically, (54) is replaced by a function of the spins and of the currents given by a collection\nof invariant tensors the indices of which are contracted with the indices of representation\nmatrices evaluated on the currents. The pattern of contraction depends on the triangulation,\nthe tree, the graph and can be potentially complicated. Thanks to the diagrammatic methods,\none can read the contraction patterns out of the corresponding (open) spin network. The\nevaluation of this diagram is a function of the currents and yields the value of the generating\nfunctional\nO\nO\n0(a,b)\nA\u0393\n(jf , J) = h\n\u03c0 jl (eJl ),\n\u03b9n i,\n(61)\nn\n\nl\n\nwhere l and n stand for the lines and nodes, or vertices, of the diagram, and the pairing h, i\ndenotes the contraction of the indices determined by the combinatorics of the diagram.\nThe implementation of the grasping operator \u03a3\u0302ae proceeds in the same way than in the\ngauge invariant case and the amplitude associated to a graph \u0393, to the chosen configuration\nc\u0393 = 0 and to a particular tree T is thus given by an expression of the form\nYX\nYX\nA(jf , sv ),\n(62)\nA0\u0393 = (i\u03b1)E\u0393\ndjf\nf\n\nv\n\njf\n\nsv\n\nwhere A(jf , sv ) is given by the evaluation of a particular spin network diagram determined by\nthe triangulation \u2206, the tree T and the graph \u0393. A sum over all possible graspings of each\noperator \u03a3e for each edge e is assumed in the notation so that A(jf , sv ) is in fact a sum over\nspin network diagrams.\nThe exact form of A(jf , sv ) can be obtained by the following graphical method based on\nthe cable and wire technology [28, 29].\n\u2022 To each e of the graph \u0393, associate an oriented open j = 1/2 line which is marked by a\nvertex from which emerges an open line in the adjoint j = 1 representation.\n\u2022 To each face f of the dual triangulation \u2206\u2217 which does not touch any edge e of \u0393 associate\na closed loop coloured by a spin jw and orientated according to the orientation of the\nface.\n\n17\n\n\fj6\nj6\nj6\nj1\nj1 replacements\nj1 replacements\nPSfrag replacements PSfrag replacements\nPSfrag\nPSfrag\nj5\nj5\nj5\nj2\n\nj2\nj4\n\nj3\n\nj2\nj4\n\nj3\n\nj4\n\nj3\n\nj3\n\nj3\n\nj3 j2\n\nj2\n\nj3 j2\n\nj4\n\nj4\n\nj4\n\nj4\n\nj3\n\nj6\nj6\nj6\nj1 replacements\nj1 replacements\nj1 replacements\nPSfrag replacements PSfrag\nPSfrag\nPSfrag\nj5\nj5\nj5\nj2\nj3\n\nj2\nj4\n\nj3\n\nj2\n\nj4\n\nj3\n\nj4\n\nj3\n\nj6\nj1 replacements\nPSfrag replacements PSfrag\nj5\nj2\n\nj1\n\nj1\nj5\nj2\n\nj4\n\nj3\n\nj6\n\nj4\n\nj5\n\nj1\n\nj6\n\nj4\n\n3\n\nj4\n\nj5\n\nj3 j2\n\nj4\n\nj6\nj6\nj6\nj1 replacements\nPSfrag replacements PSfrag replacements\nPSfrag replacements\nPSfrag\nj5\nj5\nj5\nj1\nj1\nj2\nj j2\nj j2\n3\n\nj4\n\nj3\n\nj4\n\nj3 j2\n\nj2\n\nj6\n\nj3 j2\n\nj4\n\nj6\nj6\nj6\nj1 replacements\nPSfrag replacements PSfrag\nPSfrag replacements\nPSfrag replacements\nj\nj5\nj\n5\n5\nj1\nj1\nj3\n\nj5\n\nj2\nj4\n\nj6\nj6\nj6\nj1 replacements\nj1 replacements\nPSfrag replacements PSfrag\nPSfrag\nPSfrag replacements\nj5\nj\nj5\n5\nj1\nj2\n\nj1\n\nj1\n\nj5\n\nj6\n\nj2\nj4\n\nj3\n\nj1\nj2\nj3\n\nj5\n\nj6\n\nj4\n\nj6\n\nj4\n\nFigure 1: Spin network diagrams for the different possible vertex amplitudes Av (up to symmetry) of the gauge invariant observables. The dashed lines are in the spin half representation\nand the curved lines denote the grasping operators in the spin one representation. To each\ndepicted diagram, one must add the two diagrams obtained by summing over the possible\ngrapsings. Note that due to the Ve terms there can be additional spin half lines that have not\nbeen included in these diagrams. We have also omitted for simplicity the ordering labels at\neach vertex and the arrows on the lines.\n\n18\n\n\f\u2022 For each edge e of the graph \u0393, select a couple of faces fe , fe\u2032 (or of wedges we , we\u2032 ) among\nthe three faces (wedges) touching e and s(e), and assign an oriented closed loop marked\nwith a vertex from which emerges an open line coloured by an adjoint representation\nj = 1 to fe and fe\u2032 .\n\u2022 For each edge e of \u0393, connect the two open lines emerging from the couple of faces fe , fe\u2032\nto a three-valent vertex corresponding to the totally antisymmetric tensor \u01ebae be ce .\n\u2022 Connect, for each edge e of \u0393, the third line emerging from the three-valent vertex to\nthe open line emerging from the vertex marking the j = 1/2 line assigned to the edge e.\n\u2022 To each edge e of the complex \u2206\u2217 not belonging to the tree T is assigned a box traversed by all the lines associated to e, which correspond to the irreducible representations\nlabelling the wedges adjacent to the edge e possibly supplemented by spin 1/2 representations 6 .\n\u2022 Perform the integrals by replacing the boxes by the corresponding intertwiners using\nequations (47), (50), (53).\n\u2022 Assign the factor (\u2212i/4)\u0398(jfe )\u0398(jfe\u2032 ) to each grasping\n\u2022 Sum over the diagrams obtained by summing over all possible couples fe , fe\u2032 for each\nedge e of \u0393.\nThe result of a such procedure for a given set of spins {jf , sv } yields a number A(jf , sv ) \u2208 C.\nFrom this spin network evaluation, one can calculate A0\u0393 . The same prescription then applies,\nmodified appropriately, to all configurations c of a given graph \u0393. Note also that this graphical\nmethod applies to the gauge-invariant context by simply suppressing the tree.\nThis closes the general prescription to compute observables in 3d spinfoam quantum gravity\nwith fermions. To sharpen the details and techniques of the procedure, we now fix a particular\ntriangulated 3-manifold and illustrate the techniques derived above to calculate the expectation\nvalue of the Polyakov line and of the fermion two-point function.\n\nExplicit calculations: observables on S 3\n\n4\n\nIn this section, we give examples of the calculations described above for a space-time manifold\nhomeomorphic to the three-sphere, i.e., M \u223c\n= S 3 . We consider the triangulation, denoted \u2206, of\nS 3 with the boundary of a 4-simplex7 and label each vertex v of \u2206\u2217 (the pentachoron graph)\nby the labels I, J = 1, ..., 5 which implies that the edges e of \u2206\u2217 are labelled by couples IJ,\nwith I 6= J, and the faces f of \u2206\u2217 are labelled by triples IJK, with I 6= J 6= K corresponding\nto the three vertices belonging to the face. The Dirac part of the action (3) for \u2206, with rescaled\ntriad, is\nX\nSD = \u03b1\nSIJ .\n(63)\nI6=J\n\nThe examples we will consider are the Polyakov line Of (e) = (\u03c8s(e) , Ve \u03c8t(e) ), and the propagator Of AB (x1 , x2 ) = \u03c8xA1 \u03c8\u0304x2 B . We will now calculate the Berezin integrals explicitly to\nillustrate the Feynman rules for both observables.\n\n4.1\n\nGauge invariant observable: Polyakov line\n\nFor this observable we consider Of (23) = (\u03c82 , V253 \u03c83 ), with V253 = V25 V53 . The bosonic\nobservable Ob formed by integrating the Grassmann variables is\n\u0013\n\u0012Z\n(64)\nOb =\nd\u03bc(\u03c8 I , \u03c8I ) (\u03c82 , V253 \u03c83 ) eiSD ,\nG\u2206\n\n6 The\n\norder with which the lines enter the boxes is irrelevant because of the permutation symmetry discussed\nabove.\n7 The (pseudo-)triangulation constructed from only two tetrahedra can not be used as it is not possible to\nproperly define the action. This is because there is more than one edge connecting two vertices. While this\nis not problematic when working with theories of flat connections, it becomes highly ambiguous when dealing\nwith non-trivial curvature.\n\n19\n\n\fWe will consider one relevant non-vanishing term in the Feynman expansion (19) in order to\ncompute the amplitude I\u0393 of a single admissible graph in equation (21).\n\u0013\n\u0012Z\nOb = ... + (i\u03b1)9\nd\u03bc(\u03c8 I , \u03c8I ) \u03c8 2A V253A B \u03c83B\nG\u2206\nC\nD\n\u00d7\u03c8 1C D12 D \u03c82 \u03c8 2E D23EF \u03c83F \u03c8 3G D32GH \u03c82H\nQ\nN\nP\nR S\n\u00d7\u03c8 4M D45M\nN \u03c83 \u03c8 5P D54 Q \u03c84 \u03c8 5R D51 S \u03c81\n\n\u03c8 3I D34IJ \u03c84J \u03c8 4K D41KL \u03c81L\n\n\u03c8 1T D15TU \u03c85U + ...,\n\n(65)\n\n2\n2\nincluding the factor of 2 coming from the identical contribution of the SIJ\nand SJI\nterms. This\ncorresponds to a particular Feynman graph which we denote \u0393(2, 3). Taking into account the\norder of the Grassmann variables, performing the integrals and contracting the indices leaves\nus with a global sign of \u01eb\u0393(2,3) = \u22121. This agrees with the usual QFT Feynman rules where\none associates a minus sign to each closed loop.\nHence\n\n\u01eb\u0393(2,3) I\u0393(2,3) = \u2212(i\u03b1)9 tr (D32 V253 ) tr (D21 D15 D54 D41 D15 D54 D43 D32 ) .\n\n(66)\n\nApplying the graphical method described above gives us a number of admissible graphs,\nthe graph \u0393(2, 3) corresponding to the term in the Feynman expansion above is given by the\nfollowing\n2\n\n2\n\nP(3, 2)\n\nPSfrag replacements\n1\n21\n3\n3\n4\n5\n\u21d2\n\n1\nPSfrag replacements\n\n3\n\nL\n4\n\n5\n\n5\n\n4\n\nThe path P(3, 2) runs from vertex 3 to vertex 2 and has length EP = 1, and the loop term L\nhas EL = 8 and passes through the following chain of vertices: 154154321. The overall length\nis therefore E\u0393(2,3) = 2n \u2212 p = 9. The Feynman rules in section 3 now associate a product of\nDirac matrices De to the edges of \u0393(2, 3) which gives equation (66).\nThis completes the fermionic integration, we can now consider the gravitational integration.\n0\nAs above, we will consider the c = 0 configuration I\u0393(2,3)\n, which is given by\n0\nI\u0393(2,3)\n\n=\n\n(i\u03b1)9 tr (\u03a332 U32 V253 )\n\u00d7tr (\u03a321 U21 \u03a315 U15 \u03a354 U54 \u03a341 U41 \u03a315 U15 \u03a354 U54 \u03a343 U43 ) .\n\n(67)\n\nUsing this, one can apply the graphical methods of section 3 to obtain the generating functional\nand then the amplitude A0\u0393(2,3) of the graph \u0393(2, 3).\nA0\u0393(2,3)\n\n=\n\n\u0010 \u03b1 \u00119\n4\n\n\u00d7\n\nY\n\nX\n\ndim jIJK (\u22121)2(j145 +j123 +j245 +j234 +j135 )\n\n(68)\n\nI<J<K jIJK\n\nX\n\nX\n\nX XXXXX\n\ns15 ,t15 s23 ,t23 s45 ,t45 s14 s12 s25 s34 s35\n\n\u00d7 dim s15 dim t15 dim s14 dim s12 dim s23 dim t23 dim s25 dim s34 dim s35 dim s45 dim t45\n\n\u00d7\u03982 (j123 )\u03982 (j124 )\u0398(j125 )\u03982 (j134 )\u03982 (j135 )\u03984 (j145 )\u0398(j234 )\u03982 (j235 )\u0398(j245 )\u0398(j345 )\n\u00d7A1 (j1.. , s1. )A2 (j2.. , s2. )A3 (j3.. , s3. )A4 (j4.. , s4. )A5 (j5.. , s5. )\n\nHere, the global factor is due to the multiplication of the i\u03b1 factors coming from the Feynman\nrules\nfrom the global contribution attached to each grasping\n\u221a\n\u221a with the factor \u2212i/4 coming\n(i 6/2 arising from the \u03b3 a , 6 from the \u01ebabc tensor and \u22121/12 from the \u03a3\u0302ae ).\nThe signs are due to the Haar integrals, and the \u0398(jIJK ) terms come from the normalisation\nof the source derivatives.

We have identified and properly gauge fixed the\nsymmetries of the model, given a general procedure to compute gauge invariant and gauge\ndependent observables and illustrated the techniques on an example.\nIt is important to stress the achievements of this work with respect to the original proposal\n[1]. We have 1) extended the model to massless fermionic fields, 2) implemented a new\nprocedure to compute the Berezin integrals, 3) introduced observables, 4) recoupled the vertex\namplitudes to express them as combinations of 6j symbols.\nMany issues remain open. First, unlike the point particle case, fields break the topological\ninvariance of three dimensional gravity. The model is therefore only an approximation of the\ncontinuum theory, even if the spinfoam explicitly derives from a classical action. This leads\nto two questions. First, do the asymptotics (j \u2192 \u221e) of the vertex amplitudes reproduce (a\nsimple function of) the classical Regge action coupled to the Feynman diagrams issued from\nthe fermionic integration? Second, and most importantly: what is the behaviour of the model\n\n24\n\n\funder refinement of the triangulation? Since the finiteness of our Feynman diagram expansion\nis due to the cut-off on the number of degrees of freedom induced by the triangulation, this\nissue is of primary interest. This issue was considered in [30] where a group field theory\napproach to the model was constructed, in order to implement a sum over triangulations.\nFinally, one would need to analyse the well known fermion doubling problem appearing in\nlattice-like theories incorporating fermions. Does the spinfoam generate doublers? Could we\nmodify the action to suppress the extra species?\nWe close with the perspectives. Working with a three-dimensional non-topological model\nhas taught us techniques that could be useful in the full four-dimensional theory coupled to\nmatter. This leads us to the most interesting outlook which would be a generalisation of the\nideas and techniques developed here to four spacetime dimensions. At first, one might expect\nthe coupling of fermions to the EPRL or FK models [31, 32, 33] of four dimensional quantum\ngravity to be problematic. The reason is that the kinetic term of the standard Dirac action in\na d-dimensional curved spacetime couples to the d \u2212 1 exterior power of the d-bein. Hence, in\neven dimensions, fermions are coupled to Palatini gravity via an odd power of the gravitational\nfield not convertible into any power of the d \u2212 2-form B field of BF theory. However, if one\nuses the Capovilla, Dell, Jacobson, Mason chiral action [34] of fermions coupled to two-form\ngravity, the fermions indeed couple to the B field and one could imagine such an action as an\ninteresting starting point for a four-dimensional construction.\n\nAcknowledgements\nWe are grateful to Laurent Lellouch for discussions on the fermion two-point function in\nlattice QCD and to John W.
