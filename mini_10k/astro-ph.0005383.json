All galaxies were detected\n8\nrevealing high brightness temperature (Tb >\n\u223c 10 K) radio sources. Free-free emission is unlikely since it\ngreatly overpredicts the soft X-ray luminosities. We infer the presence of AGN-like, non-thermal radio\nemission most likely powered by under-fed black holes. Together with our VLA sample we estimate from\nour observations that at least half of LINER galaxies host genuine AGN. We find no evidence for highly\ninverted radio cores as predicted in the ADAF model: the (non-simultaneous) spectral indices are on\naverage around \u03b1 = 0.0. In the two brightest sources we detect some extended emission, which appears\nto originate in jets in at least one of these galaxies. Together with the spectral indices this suggests that\nthe nuclear emission at centimeter radio waves is largely dominated by emission from radio jets, very\nsimilar to the situation in more luminous AGN. The energy released in these jets could be a significant\nfraction of the energy budget in the accretion flow.\nSubject headings: galaxies: active - galaxies: jets - galaxies: nuclei - galaxies: structure - galaxies:\nSeyferts - radio continuum: galaxies\ntheir nuclei (e.g. Jones et al. 1981), prominent cases in spiral galaxies being the Milky Way (Sgr A*) and M 81 (see\nBietenholz et al. 1996). In addition some relatively nearby\nelliptical galaxies such as M87 and NGC 1275 appear\nas low-power FR I radio galaxies and also contain wellknown compact radio cores (Cohen et al. 1969; Schilizzi et\nal. 1975).\nThese radio sources resemble the cores of radio-loud\nquasars, showing a very high brightness temperature and a\nflat to inverted radio spectrum that extends up to sub-mm\nwavelengths. Models proposed for these low luminosity radio nuclei are either a scaled AGN model, in which the core\nis the synchrotron self-absorbed base of a radio jet coupled\nto an underluminous accretion disk (Falcke, Mannheim, &\nBiermann 1993; Falcke 1996; Falcke & Biermann 1999) or\nan advection-dominated accretion flow (ADAF; Narayan\net al. 1998; see also Melia 1992; Fabian & Rees 1995).\nEarlier surveys have shown that E and S0 galaxies often\nhave compact, flat-spectrum radio sources in their nuclei\n(Wrobel & Heeschen 1984, 1991; Sadler et al. 1989; Slee et\nal. 1994). Some of the most prominent flat-spectrum nuclear radio sources in nearby galaxies are found in galaxies\nwith LINER nuclear spectra (O'Connell & Dressel 1978),\nbut so far there has been no comprehensive study of radio\nnuclei in a significant sample of LINER galaxies, which\nmake up the majority of galaxies with low-level nuclear\nactivity. We have, therefore, recently conducted a sur-\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\nThe evidence for supermassive black holes in the nuclei of most galaxies has become much stronger recently.\nSome of the best cases are the Milky Way (Eckart & Genzel 1997), NGC 4258 (Miyoshi et al. 1995), and a number\nof other nearby galaxies (Richstone et al. 1998) where\nconvincing dynamical evidence for black holes exists. In\nquasars and radio galaxies their existence is commonly inferred from the huge energy output of the active galactic\nnucleus (AGN) which is probably powered by accretion\nonto the black hole. However, despite the alleged presence\nof black holes in both cases, there is a huge span in luminosity between weakly active galaxies like the Milky Way\nand AGN. The question of how these central engines are\nrelated to each other and why they appear so different despite being powered by the same type of object is therefore\nof major interest. For many nearby galaxies with low luminosity nuclear emission lines, it is not even clear whether\nthey are powered by an AGN or by star formation. This\nis especially true for Low Ionization Nuclear Emission Region (LINER) galaxies (Heckman 1980), some of which can\nbe explained in terms of aging starbursts (Alonso-Herrero\net al. 2000).\nOne of the best ways to probe the very inner parts of\nthese engines is to study the compact radio sources found\nin many AGN. Indeed, despite their low optical luminosity, quite a few nearby galaxies have such radio sources in\n1 Adjunct\n\nAstronomer, Space Telescope Science Institute\n\n1\n\n\f2\nvey of LINER galaxies with the Very Large Array (VLA;\nThompson et al. 1980) in its A configuration at 15 GHz\n(resolution \u223c0.\u2032\u2032 15) to search for compact radio emission\n(Nagar et al. 2000, Paper I). The sources were drawn\nfrom the extensive and sensitive spectroscopic study of a\ncomplete, magnitude-limited sample of 486 nearby galaxies (Ho, Filippenko, & Sargent 1995), one third of which\nshowed LINER-like activity (Ho, Filippenko, & Sargent\n1997). From those active galaxies with a LINER spectrum a subsample of 48 bright sources was drawn with no\nwell-defined selection criterion other than that they had\nbeen observed with other telescopes as well, e.g. ROSAT,\nthe HST (UV imaging, Maoz et al. 1996, Barth et al.\n1998), and the VLA at 15 GHz in A configuration (Nagar\net al. 2000) and at 1.4 and 8.4 GHz in A and B configuration (van Dyk & Ho 1997). The sample also included\nso called transition objects which have spectra intermediate between LINER and H II region galaxies. While the\nproject was being conducted a few sources in the original\nsample were re-classified as low-luminosity Seyfert galaxies. However, only one out of the ten sources discussed\nhere has a \"pure\" Seyfert spectrum.\nThe 15 GHz VLA survey found a surprisingly large number (15 out of 48) of galaxies with compact radio cores and\nflat spectral indices. Here we present Very Long Baseline\nArray (VLBA; Napier et al. 1994) observations of the\neleven brightest of these galaxies to investigate the central region of LINER galaxies at the sub-parsec scale and\nclarify the nature of their radio cores.\n2. SAMPLE SELECTION AND OBSERVATIONS\n\nFrom our A configuration VLA survey (Nagar et\nal. 2000), we selected all eleven galaxies with both nuclear\nflux densities above 3.5 mJy at 15 GHz and a flat spectrum\n(\u03b1 > \u22120.5, S\u03bd \u221d \u03bd \u03b1 ). Only one source, NGC 2655, was\nabove the flux density limit and was excluded because of\nits steep spectrum. The flux density limit was chosen so\nthat we could detect all sources with the VLBA in snapshot mode in a single 12 hr observation if most of the\n15 GHz emission were indeed compact on milli-arcsecond\n(mas) scales.\nThe observations were performed on 1997 June 16 with\nall ten antennas of the VLBA at 4.975 GHz. Because the\nsources are so faint we had to use phase-referencing. Observation of each program source was preceded by observation of a bright nearby phase calibrator. The observation\nsequence was cal-source-cal-source, which was repeated for\nthree different hour angles to improve (u,v)-coverage. The\nintegration times per scan were roughly 1-2 minutes for\nthe calibrators and \u223c8 minutes for the program galaxies.\nThe total integration time per galaxy was therefore about\n45 minutes.\nThe data for the calibrators were fringe-fitted, imaged,\nand self-calibrated in AIPS and the solutions for antenna\ngains, phases, delays, and clock rates were transferred to\nthe program sources. The data for the program sources\nwere then imaged and cleaned. Since the initial coordinates were taken from our VLA observations we had in\nmost cases a position uncertainty of \u223c0.\u2032\u2032 05\u22120.\u2032\u2032 1 and hence\nwe first imaged a wide field of view (0.\u2032\u2032 4). The map center\nwas then shifted to the highest peak in this image and the\nsource was re-mapped and phase self-calibrated. A final\namplitude and phase self-calibration was also performed\n\nfor a long solution interval (25 minutes) and the sources\nwere imaged.\nThe observations of NGC 3147 failed since the phasecalibrator was not detected, thus reducing our sample to\nten sources. We note, however, that this source, together\nwith NGC 2655 and NGC 4143, which is just barely under our flux density limit, are included in further VLBA\nobservations (Nagar et al., in preparation).\n3. RESULTS\n\nWe detected all 10 sources with the VLBA. The results\nare shown in Table 1, where we list the galaxy names, distances (from Ho et al. 1997), Hubble galaxy type from RC3\n(de Vaucouleurs et al. 1991) and spectroscopic classification from Ho et al. (1997) in columns 1 - 4. The sources are\nequally distributed between early- and late-type galaxies.\nWe also give the positions of the radio sources (columns\n5 and 6). The internal errors of the positions should be\nabout the beam size (2.5 mas) or better for the stronger\nones, but the absolute astrometric accuracy is limited by\nthe uncertainty in the positions of the phase calibrators,\n(listed in column 7). In addition, we list the total and peak\nflux densities in the VLBA maps and the brightness temperature (column 10, defined below). Our 1\u03c3 rms noise\nis typically 0.2 mJy and hence for the weakest source we\nobtain a dynamic range of 15:1. For extended sources we\ngive the position angle (column 11) of an elliptical Gaussian component fitted to the core. For comparison we also\nlist the peak VLA flux density at 15 GHz (column 12) from\nour previous survey and the (non-simultaneous) spectral\nindex \u03b1 between the peak VLA 15 GHz and total VLBA\n5 GHz flux densities (column 13).\nThe two brightest sources in our sample, NGC 4278 &\nNGC 6500, for which we have the largest dynamic range,\nshow core plus jet structures (Fig. 1). While the compact\nemission in these two sources was known before (Jones et\nal. 1981), the new observations now show the extended\nemission with unprecedented quality. NGC 6500 has a\ncore and a symmetric two-sided jet, while NGC 4278 has\nan extended core and an elongated source towards the SE.\nThe other sources are point-like with the possible exceptions of NGC 3226 and NGC 5866, although phase errors\nmay be responsible for the extension in these faint sources.\nThe spectral indices range from \u03b1 = \u22120.5 to \u03b1 = 0.2,\nwith an average h\u03b1i = 0.0 \u00b1 0.2. We note that the VLBA\ndoes not provide spacings as short as the VLA. The VLBA\nmeasurements at 5 GHz may then underestimate the true\nflux density if the sources are extended below the 150 mas\nscale, so the actual spectrum might be less inverted (i.e.\nthe spectral index smaller) than we measure here. The statistical error in our flux density measurements produces a\n1 \u03c3 error of up to \u00b10.1 in the 5-to-15 GHz spectral index\nfor the weakest sources.\nFrom the flux densities and the sizes we have measured,\nwe can calculate the brightness temperatures for a Gaussian flux density distribution with the following equation\n\n6\n\nTb = 7.8 \u00d7 10 K\n\n\u0012\n\nS\u03bd\nmJy\n\n\u0013\u0012\n\n\u03b8\n2.5 mas\n\n\u0013\u22122 \u0010\n\n\u03bd \u0011\u22122\n(1)\n5 GHz\n\nwhere \u03b8 is the FWHM of the Gaussian beam (e.g. Condon et al. 1982).

Since most of our sources\nare unresolved, these values are usually lower limits.\n4. DISCUSSION\n\nOur result has a number of interesting implications. The\npresence of high brightness temperature radio cores in our\nLINER sample confirms the presence of AGN-like activity in these galaxies. It is unlikely that the radio sources\nrepresent free-free emission, as has been claimed for example in NGC 1068 (Gallimore, Baum, O'Dea 1997), since a\nmuch higher soft X-ray luminosity than is typically observed in low-luminosity AGN would result. The emission\ncoefficient for thermal bremsstrahlung from a gas at temperature T is (e.g. Longair 1992, eq. 3.43)\n1\n\u01eb\u03bd = 6.8 \u00d7 10\u221251 Z 2 T \u2212 /2 Np Ne\n\n*g(\u03bd, T )exp(\u2212h\u03bd/kT ) Wm\u22123 Hz\n\n\u22121\n\n(2)\n\nwhere g(\u03bd, T ) is the Gaunt factor. If we consider a plasma\nat temperature T \u2243 108 K, then at 5 GHz, the exponential factor in eqn. (2) is 1, while the Gaunt factor is \u223c12.\nIn the soft X-ray regime, taken as 0.4 keV to 2 keV, the\nGaunt factor varies between 1.7 and 0.8, respectively, while\nthe exponential factor in eq. (2) varies between 0.95 and\n0.8, respectively. Therefore, the luminosity, per Hertz, at\n0.4 keV and 2 keV is \u223c0.25 times and \u223c0.05 times that\nat 5 GHz, respectively. The geometric mean monochromatic luminosities of the nuclei observed by us is 1027.5\u00b10.6\nerg sec\u22121 Hz\u22121 at 5 GHz. If this emission traces thermal\nbremsstrahlung we would expect the total 0.4\u20132 keV luminosity of these nuclei to be 1043.9 erg s\u22121 . However, the\nobserved 0.4-2 keV luminosities for low-luminosity AGN\ntend to be of the order of 1039\u221240 erg s\u22121 (e.g. Ptak et\nal. 1999)-many orders of magnitude lower and thus rendering a thermal origin of the radio emission very unlikely.\nOf course photoelectric absorption could attenuate some\nof the soft X-ray emission, however, since seven of our\ngalaxies show broad H\u03b1 emission (spectral type 1.9) the\nabsorption should only be moderate. To make this argument more watertight one will need to investigate multiwavelength data for our galaxies on a case-by-case basis.\nOn the other hand, the compact, flat-spectrum cores we\nhave found are similar to those typically produced in many\nAGN. Hence we can take the presence of compact, nonthermal radio emission as good evidence for the presence\nof an AGN in our galaxies. The 100% detection rate with\nthe VLBA, based on our selection of flat-spectrum cores\nfound in a 15 GHz VLA survey, shows that for statistical\npurposes we could have relied on the VLA alone for identification of these compact, high brightness radio sources.\nHence, with 15 GHz VLA surveys of nearby galaxies one\nhas an efficient tool for identifying low-luminosity AGN.\nThis complements other methods for identifying AGN,\nsuch as searching for broad emission-lines or hard X-rays,\nand has the advantage of not being affected by obscuration.\n\nIf we only consider galaxies with a LINER spectrum,\nwe found at least eleven flat-spectrum radio cores at 15\nGHz in a sub-sample of 24 LINERs observed by Nagar\net al. (2000). Eight of these eleven LINERs are included\nin our sample here, yielding a lower limit to the AGN\nfraction for LINERs of at least 33 \u00b1 12% (8/24). Based\non our 100% detection rate of these flat-spectrum cores\nwith the VLBA, we can, however, argue that all eleven\nflat spectrum sources found in the VLA study are likely\nto be AGN, raising the AGN fraction of LINERs to at\nleast 46 \u00b1 14% (11/24). These ratios do not change significantly if we include the galaxies classified as Seyferts.\nSince the selection of our parent sample is not very well\ndefined, we could still be subject to an unquantifiable bias.\nThis can be minimized by studying the radio emission of a\ndistance-limited sample, which we plan in a future paper.\nFirst results (Falcke et al. 1999) seem to indicate that the\nbias is not large.\nThe two brightest radio sources in our sample show extended structure suggestive of jet-like outflows, and the\nother seven sources are unresolved or slightly resolved.\nOur very limited dynamic range is not good enough to\nprove or exclude the presence of jets for the latter. Moreover, VLBA observations of M81 (Bietenholz et al. 2000)\nhave shown that jets in low-luminosity AGN can be very\ncompact and difficult to detect. The only clue we therefore have is the spectrum which is flat or slightly inverted.\nSuch a spectrum is obtained in jet models (Blandford &\nK\u00f6nigl 1979; Falcke 1996; Falcke & Biermann 1999), where\nthe spectral index ranges from \u03b1 = 0.0 to 0.23 as a function of inclination angle to the line-of-sight. In no case do\nwe find a spectral index as high as \u03b1 = 0.4 as predicted\nin the ADAF model (Yi & Boughn 1998). This does not\nnecessarily exclude the ADAF model, but argues for the\nparsec scale radio emission at centimeter radio waves being dominated by another component, such as a radio jet\nor a wind. A combination of an underluminous disk or\nan ADAF and a radio jet is one possibility (e.g. Donea,\nFalcke, & Biermann 1999).\nAssuming the cores are produced by randomly oriented,\nmaximally efficient jets from supermassive black holes (of\norder 108 M\u2299 ) we can use eq. (20) of Falcke & Biermann\n(1999) to calculate that for an average monochromatic luminosity of 1027.5 erg sec\u22121 Hz\u22121 at 5 GHz the jets would\n42.5\nrequire a minimum total jet power of order Qjet >\n\u223c 10\n\u22121\nerg sec . Compared to quasars this is a rather low value\nand supports the conclusion, based on their low UV and\nemission line luminosities, that the cores are powered by\nunder-fed black holes. On the other hand this jet power is\nwell within the range of the bolometric luminosity of typical low-luminosity AGN (1041\u221243 erg sec\u22121 ; Ho 1999) and,\ncompared to radiation, jets could be a significant energy\nloss channel for the accretion flow.\nThis research was supported by NASA and NSF under\ngrants NAG8-1027 and AST9527289, respectively.
