INTRODUCTION\nThe investigation of the vibrations of atoms and molecules at surfaces is important\nand interesting as they provide a direct link to the surface force fields which further\ndisclose the nature of the bonding between surface atoms and how it differs from that\nbetween atoms in the bulk solid. Insights so gained about the details of the potential\nenergy surface also contribute to the understanding of surface phenomena such as\nadsorption and diffusion which are critical ingredients of the industrially relevant process\nof catalysis. In general, atoms adsorbed on surfaces vibrate with frequencies and\ndisplacement patterns that depend on the symmetry of the adsorption site and the surface\ngeometry. Surface vibrations have thus been used for the determination of adsorption\nsite and adsorbate-substrate bonding strengths. While some of this information is already\navailable from the measured and calculated vibrational frequencies of the modes at the\nBrillouin zone center (\u0393 point), more detailed insights and information are offered by the\ndispersion of the phonon frequencies along the high symmetry directions in the two\ndimensional surface Brillouin zone. In particular, the characteristics of the dispersion\ncurves speak to the nature of the adsorbate-substrate interactions and adsorbate-adsorbate\nlateral interactions, both direct and those introduced through the substrate. In this study\nwe present the calculated phonon dispersion curves of a monolayer of H adsorbed on\nPt(111) for several possible H adsorptions sites. Our goal is two-fold. First we are\ninterested in finding how the adsorption of a light atom like H affects the dispersion of\nthe substrate surface phonons. Such a study would tell us about the nature of the bonding\nbetween H and the surrounding Pt atoms, and between the Pt surface atoms. Second,\ndistinct features in the phonon dispersion curves may help resolve lingering issues about\nH adsorption site on Pt(111) which has been the subject of much experimental and\ntheoretical investigation for some time now.1 - 25 In an earlier theoretical and experimental\nstudy of the surface phonon dispersion curves based on parameterized force constants1\nsome conclusions have already been drawn about the effect of H adsorption on Pt surface\nforce constants and on the frequency of the Pt Rayleigh mode. One conclusion is that\nwhile the force constants between the surface atoms on clean Pt(111) are different from\nthe values in the bulk, adsorption of 1 ML of H restores these force constants to almost\nthe bulk values. However, these studies based on empirical models were meant to\nprovide an understanding of some controversial features observed in He atom-surface\nscattering data for the phonons of clean Pt(111) and did not address issues specific to the\ndetails of H adsorption on Pt(111). The focus was thus on modes with frequencies lower\nthan that of the Rayleigh waves and the dispersion of modes with higher frequencies\nincluding the H vibrational modes were not presented.\nAfter extensive debate, three decades of experimental and theoretical studies of H on\nPt(111) have led to the conclusion that H adsorbs preferably in the threefold hollow site,\nforms an ordered (1x1) overlayer at saturation coverage, and hybridization occurs\nbetween the 1s states of H and the d bands of Pt. The lingering issue is that of the\nassignment of the vibrational modes observed for full coverage which also raises\nquestions about the symmetry of the adsorption site. While the very early high resolution\nelectron energy loss spectroscopy (HREELS) measurements of Baro et al.3 had revealed\n\n2\n\n\fonly two modes, one at 68 meV and another at 153 meV, at the Brillouin zone center,\nsubsequent HREELS measurements have displayed an additional mode at about 112\nmeV.5, 12 The presence of the third mode has rekindled the debate on the preferred site\nfor H adsorption,3 - 10 the polarization of the modes,3, 5, 11, 12 and whether H remains\nlocalized or delocalized on the surface.12 - 16 The extent of anharmonicity of the H modes\nhas also been discussed with the conclusion that while the mode polarized normal to the\nsurface is reasonably harmonic, the one in the direction parallel to the surface is\nsignificantly anharmonic.9, 12, 16 The issue of the adsorption site is all the more intriguing\nbecause in the thermal desorption data taken by Jacobi and coworkers12 there is the onset\nof an additional peak for H coverage exceeding an estimated 0.75 ML. The diffusion\nbarrier for H on Pt(111) has also been found to be small (~70 meV),17 giving further\ntestimony to the equivalence of the three adsorption sites: fcc-hollow, hcp-hollow, and\non-top. Furthermore, the frequencies of H vibrations are found to be coverage dependent.\nRecent HREELS measurements find modes at lower coverage (\u03b8 < 0.75) at 31 meV and\n68 meV, which they designate as polarized normal and parallel to the surface,\nrespectively. 12 For higher coverage (0.75<\u03b8 <1) the modes with polarization normal to\nthe surface appear to be at 112 meV and 153 meV,5, 12 while that polarized in the surface\nplane is at 68 meV. Related theoretical calculations12 assign the modes at 68 meV and\n153 meV to vibrations localized around an equilibrium position in the three fold hollow\nsite. The mode at 112 meV is not easily accounted for in these calculations, for obvious\nreasons. The symmetry of the surface requires that the two in-plane modes be degenerate\nat the Brillouin zone center, if H occupies a single adsorption site. The third modes has\nthus been explained as either an overtone, a combination loss,5 or as a mixed mode\narising from H delocalized over the fcc and hcp hollow sites.12 On the other hand, a more\ncomplex adsorption scheme could lead to some interesting conclusions about H\nvibrational frequencies. To explain details in the analysis of photoemission data, a twostate adsorption model was proposed,2, 4 but subsequently argued to be incompatible with\nphotoemission data.8 The proposal of subsurface H has reemerged in recent times,16, 18\nalthough clear experimental evidence is yet to be provided.\nIn this study we consider first the case of 1 ML coverage of H on Pt(111) and\ncompare the structural and dynamical properties of the system for the three surface\nadsorption sites: fcc-hollow, hcp-hollow, and on-top. Our calculations are based on\ndensity functional perturbation theory (DFPT) based on the linear response theory and the\nharmonic approximation.26 For a possible explanation of the observed frequency of the\nthird mode at the Brillouin zone center, we consider also the case of subsurface H\nadsorption for 2 ML coverage. This higher coverage is not unreasonable since the exact\nknowledge of coverage from experiments performed for saturation coverage is not easy\nto obtain, particularly for an adsorbate like H.\nBelow we provide some details of our calculations in Section II, followed by a\ndescription of our model system in section III. The results for 1 ML coverage are\npresented in Section IV with discussion of the calculated structural properties followed\nby that of the phonon dispersion curves. The case of subsurface adsorption for 2 ML\ncoverage is presented in Section V together with summary of our conclusions.\n\n3\n\n\fII. THEORETICAL DETAILS\nThe total energy of the fully relaxed systems was calculated using the density functional\ntheory within the pseudopotential method in a mixed basis representation.27 To represent\nion-electron interaction, a norm-conserving pseudopotential with scalar-relativistc\ncorrection was used in the local density approximation (LDA). The Pt pseudopotential\nincludes, except spin-orbit coupling, all relativistic corrections up to order \u03b12, where \u03b1 is\nthe fine structure constant. The electron-electron interaction28 was represented by a\nHedin-Lundqvist form of the exchange-correlation functional.29 For the valence states of\nPt and H local functions of d and s type with radial cutoffs of 2.1 a.u. and 0.7 a.u.,\nrespectively, were applied. Kinetic energy cutoff for plane waves was 16.5 Ryd.\nIntegration over an irreducible Brillouin-zone were carried out using 42 special kpoints.\nA Fermi level smearing of 0.014 Ryd was employed.30 Structural relaxations were carried\nout until the forces, calculated using the Hellmann-Feynman theorem, on all atoms were\nless than 0.001 Ryd/a.u.\nThe calculations of the vibrational frequencies and their eigenvector were performed\nusing linear response theory within a perturbative approach31 in a mixed-basis\nrepresentation of the wave functions. Phonon dispersion curves were obtained by\nstandard Fourier interpolation method using a (6x6) q-point mesh. Surface force\nconstants were merged with bulk force constants and an asymmetric bulk slab of 100\nlayers was added to obtain projected bulk phonon modes32 using standard lattice\ndynamical methods. An (8x8x8) q-point mesh was used for the calculation of the bulk\nphonons. Vibrational modes were labeled as surface modes if their eigenvectors\ncontained contributions larger than 20% of the displacements of the atoms in the top two\nPt layers.\n\nIII. MODEL SYSTEMS\nIn Fig. 1(a) the top view of a close-packed arrangement of spheres representing a\nsegment of the fcc(111) surface is shown. The large white circles are Pt atoms. The three\nadsorption sites, fcc, hcp and on-top are marked, respectively, as A, B, and C in the figure.\n1 ML coverage of H in the fcc site, for example, would mean occupation of all sites\nlabeled A in Fig. 1(a). Beneath the points B there are Pt atoms in the second layer, while\nunderneath A the substrate atoms are in the third layer, consistent with fcc stacking of\nsolids. Since these three adsorption sites have been the subject of much discussion and\nsince the calculated adsorption energy for H in each of these sites is close to that\nmeasured experimentally,10 we have carried out calculations of the dispersion of the\nsurface phonons for each of them. The two dimensional Brillouin zone for fcc(111)\nsurface is shown in Fig. 1(b).\nFor the calculations a total of 9 layers of Pt atoms and one H atom on each side were\nused for a slab with inversion symmetry. The surface (1x1) unit-cell used to simulate\n1ML H adsorption is shown in Fig. 1(a) as a parallelogram.\n\n4\n\n\fIV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS\nA. Structural Relaxations\n\nThe calculated relaxed geometrical structures for 1 ML of H adsorbed in each of the three\nsites on Pt(111) are summarized in Table I. In agreement with previous theoretical\ncalculations,9 we find the height of the H atoms above the Pt surface for fcc, hcp, and ontop site adsorption to be 0.93 \u00c5, 0.93 \u00c5, and 1.56 \u00c5, respectively, with H-Pt bond lengths\nof 1.85 \u00c5, 1.85 \u00c5, and 1.56 \u00c5. We find distance between H in the hcp-site and the\nsecond layer Pt atoms directly below to be 3.3 \u00c5. Our calculated adsorption energies for\n1 ML H coverage are 0.41 eV (fcc), 0.37 eV (hcp), and 0.31 eV (on-top) showing a slight\npreference for fcc site adsorption, and in close agreement with experimental results (0.23\n~ 0.47 eV ) for a range of coverage. 2, 19 - 23 In a detailed theoretical study 9 in which\ndensity functional theory calculations were carried out for the H/Pt(111) system with both\nLDA and the generalized gradient approximation (GGA), as well as, scalar relativistic\nand spin-orbit corrections, the preferred adsorption site for H on Pt(111) was also\npredicted to be the fcc hollow. Interestingly, Olsen et al 9 find GGA to provide better\nagreement with experimental values of the adsorption energies while LDA is found to\noverestimate them: 0.75 eV ~ 0.81 eV (fcc) and 0.71 eV ~ 0.8 eV (top) depending on\nwhether full relativistic or scalar relativistic corrections were used. In a more recent\nstudy, Legare also using GGA finds adsorption energies in the range of 0.43 eV \u2013 0.48\neV for the two hollow site adsorption.18 The differences in the adsorption energies\nreported here from those in Ref. 9 may have to do with the extent of self-consistency,\nnumber of layers in the super cell, and other details employed in the two sets of\ncalculations. To remove ambiguities in the calculated values of the adsorption energy,\nwe note that our values are with respect to those for H in the molecular state in gas phase.\nWe also note that in all calculations the adsorption energies for the three sites are found\nto be close to one another, pointing to the flatness of the potential energy surface for H on\nPt(111).\nThe changes in Pt interlayer separations are also noted in Table I. Here \u2206ij is the\npercentage change in the spacing between the layers labeled i and j. The Table shows that\nH causes an outward relaxation of the Pt surface layer of 2.3% (on-top), 2.7% (fcc) to\n3.7% (hcp).24 However, noticeable relaxations are confined only to the topmost layer,\nreflecting the compactness of the (111) surface. The calculated surface relaxations are in\nagreement with experimental observations. Note also that clean Pt(111) has been found\nto relax only marginally outwards.25 In general, the results in Table I indicate that the\nrelaxation of the Pt surface layer induced by H adsorption is similar for the three\nadsorption sites.\nB. Surface phonon dispersion curves\n\nThe surface phonon dispersion curves for 1ML of H on Pt(111) have been\ncalculated along two high symmetry directions, \u0393 \u2013 M and \u0393 \u2013 K, in the surface Brillouin\nzone shown in Fig. 1(b). In the dispersion curves displayed in Fig. 2, grey solid lines\n\n5\n\n\fcorrespond to bulk-projected modes, the dark filled-circles are the Pt substrate surface\nmodes (lower panel before the break in the vertical axis) or the vibrations of H atoms\n(upper panel after the break), and the white circles represent the data from He-atom\nsurface (HAS) measurements.1 Frequencies of prominent Pt and H surface phonons at the\nhigh symmetry points in the Brillouin zone are tabulated in Tables II and III, respectively.\nIt should be noted that an asymmetric slab filing was performed which gave two types of\nsurfaces in the model system: one H-covered and the other Pt bulk-terminated. Each of\nthese surfaces contributed one set of curves well separated from the bulk-projected band.\nThe set of dispersion curves in Fig. 2 thus show a grey line below the bulk-projected\nband, originating from the bulk-terminated Pt surface which should be ignored as it is an\nartifact of our calculational set up and not a part of the physical system under\nconsideration. Note that for discussions purposes we number the surface modes from the\nbottom to the top of the band. The first (lowest energy) surface mode in Figs. 2(a) \u2013 2(c),\nat the zone boundaries, are thus the Rayleigh Waves (RW) which are easily identifiable\nsince they are generally well separated from the bulk-projected bands and usually have a\nvertical polarization at the Brillouin zone boundaries.\nAt the M point, the dispersion curves for H adsorption in the fcc-site [Fig. 2(a)],\ndisplay three Pt substrate surface modes with frequencies 9.6 meV, 21.9 meV, and 22.3\nmeV (Table II). The RW (9.6 meV) consists of purely vertical vibrations of the atoms in\nthe top Pt layer. The second (21.9 meV) and the third (22.3 meV) modes comprise purely\nlongitudinal displacements of the atoms in the first and second Pt layers. At the K point,\nwe find four surface modes with frequencies 9.7 meV, 13.3 meV, 17.4 meV, and 19.6\nmeV. The frequency of the RW (9.7 meV), with pure vertical polarization, is in good\nagreement with that in the HAS measurements.1 The second substrate surface mode at K\n(13.3 meV) is mainly of vertical character with a weak parallel component. The three\ntopmost Pt layers take part in this mode such that there is a vertical displacement of Pt\natoms in the second layer while the atoms in the first and third Pt layers vibrate in the\ndirection parallel to the surface. The third substrate mode (17.4 meV) is polarized purely\nin the surface plane, however, its amplitude extends below to five Pt layers. The fourth\nmode (19.6 meV) is a surface resonance and its amplitude penetrates deep into the bulk.\nThe dispersions of the H vibrational modes are represented by the top three curves in Fig.\n2(a). The two lower curves arise from in-plane vibrations, while the top curve is the result\nof vertical displacements of the H atom. The parallel vibrational modes show substantial\ndispersion with a maximum split of 16.6 meV at the M point. The upper branch consists\nof longitudinal modes, while the lower one is the shear-horizontal mode, along both the\n\u0393- M and \u0393- K directions. At the K point, the two H parallel modes are almost degenerate\nwith a maximum difference in frequency of only 1.4 meV.\nIn Fig. 2(b) the corresponding dispersion curves for H adsorption in the hcp site\nare shown. They appear to be very similar to those discussed above for fcc-site\nadsorption, except that some substrate surface modes are slightly softened. Also, the\ndispersion of the H modes display a larger split in the frequencies of the parallel mode at\nthe M point (20.4 meV), as compared to those for fcc-site adsorption [Fig. 2(a)]. A larger\ndifference from the dispersion curves above for the two hollow-site adsorptions is\nexhibited in Fig. 2(c) by those calculated for on-top adsorption. For H vibrations parallel\nto the surface, at the \u0393 point, the frequency (47.4 meV) is much smaller than those\nobtained for the hollow-sites, while the frequency of the one polarized in the direction\n\n6\n\n\fnormal to the surface (277.2 meV) is much larger. The splitting of the frequencies of the\nmodes polarized parallel to the surface at the M point (10.4 meV) is also much smaller\nthan that for the hollow-site adsorption.\nIn addition to the differences in the dispersion of the H modes, the calculated\ndispersion of the Pt surface modes shows a striking difference for the hollow-site and topsite adsorptions. The third substrate surface mode continues to lie in the \"stomach\" gap,\nfor H top-site adsorption, as for clean Pt(111), while it gets pushed into the bulk band for\nhollow-site adsorption. Actually, it is interesting to quantify the impact of H adsorption\non Pt surface phonon dispersions, since it is so often assumed that the substrate phonons\nremain unchanged in the presence of an adsorbate as light as H.1 To get a better estimate\nof the shifts in the frequencies on H adsorption, the calculated surface phonon dispersion\ncurves for clean Pt(111) are displayed together with experimental values (white circles)\nin Fig. 2(d). While detailed analysis of the results in Fig. 2(d) can be found in a recent\nreview article,33 we comment here on the longitudinal resonances which were found in\nHe scattering experiments but not reproduced in theoretical calculations. These are the\nsets of experimental points in Fig. 2(d) above the Rayleigh mode along both the \u0393- M and\n\u0393- K directions. Our calculations do not reveal such modes either for clean Pt(111) or for\nthat with a monolayer of H adsorbed on it, as is clear from the four sets of dispersion\ncurves in Fig. 2. Note that in Ref. 1 also the longitudinal modes were found to disappear\nonce H was adsorbed on Pt(111).\nIn comparing the dispersion curves in Fig. 2, we find that the surface modes for\nclean Pt(111) undergo a few changes on H adsorption: two RW or RW-like modes on the\nclean surface, near the zone boundaries and along the M \u2013 K direction, are replaced by\nonly one in the dispersion curves for the H-covered surface. This is because the first\nmode which is vertically polarized (RW), at the zone boundaries, is softened and the next\ntwo surface modes (polarized in the surface plane) are stiffened such that they are pushed\nabove into the bulk hand, on H adsorption in the hollow-site (Table II). This trend is\nrepeated for the top-site adsorption, albeit somewhat weakly. Clearly H adsorption alters\nthe force field of the surface atoms and consequently the surface phonon dispersion\ncurves. Below we discuss some of the high lights of the Pt(111) surface force constant\nchanges brought about on H adsorption.\nC. Force constant changes\n\nThe calculated force constant matrix for the Pt(111) surface atoms with 1 ML\ncoverage of H exhibit substantial changes from the values on the clean Pt(111) surface.\nThese changes are found to be extensive and a full representation of the tables of the\nforce constants between all surface atoms for the three adsorption sites would be quite\ncumbersome and of limited interest. To fully appreciate the changes in the strength of\ncoupling between any two atoms we also need to take into account all components in the\nforce-constant matrix Fij between atoms in layers i and j. For this purpose, the convenient\nconcept of an average coupling-strength <I> for a bond length \u03c3 is introduced.28 It is\ndefined as < I > \u2261 1 \u2211 \u03a6 2 (\u03c3 ) .\n3 ij\n\nij\n\n7\n\n\fIn Table IV values of <I> and its percentage changes from the bulk values (100 *\n(<I>s - <I>bulk)/<I>bulk) are presented. Consistent with previous results,1 we find a\nremarkable weakening (33%) of the lateral interaction between Pt atoms in the top layer\non the clean surface from the bulk value. The Table shows that on-top H adsorption\nproduces only a small change in the Pt surface in-plane force constants from the values\non the clean surface, while for hollow site adsorptions these force constants undergo a\nstiffening of about 26%. The stiffening of these force constants leads to shift towards\nhigher frequencies of the surface mode in the stomach gap, in the dispersion curves in\nFigs. 2(a) and 2(b) (fcc: 21.9 meV, hcp: 21.3 meV). This is understandable since this\nstomach gap mode consists mainly of in-plane motion of the Pt surface atoms. Since the\nfrequency of this mode remains unshifted for top-site adsorption, this feature can serve as\na signature of the H adsorption site on Pt(111). Table IV also shows that the interlayer\naverage-coupling strength hardly changes for the clean Pt(111) surface with respect to\nbulk, but it softens by 28% for hcp and on-top H adsorption and by 18% for fcc\nadsorption. The changes in the average force constants are also in qualitative agreement\nwith the trends in the calculated structural relaxations.\nD. Local density of states and charge density distribution\n\nAn important conclusion from the above is that H adsorption in the hollow sites\nreverses the change in the lateral force constants between the Pt atoms in the top layer\nfrom large softening on the clean surface to stiffening on the adsorbate covered surfaces.\nTo obtain a deeper understand of the physics behind these observations, we turn to a full\nstudy of the surface electronic structure of H-covered Pt(111). For this we calculate the\nlocal density of states through projections of the total wavefunction onto atoms of interest\nwithin the Wigner-Seitz spheres around them. The Wigner-Seitz radii for the H and Pt\natoms are taken to be 0.5\u00c5 and 1.35\u00c5, respectively. In Figs. 3 and 4 we compare the\nresulting local density of states (LDOS) of the Pt atoms in the bulk [Figs. 3(a) and 4(a)]\nwith those for the atoms in the topmost layer of clean Pt(111) [Figs. 3(b) and 4(b)], and\nthose with H adsorbed in the top site [Figs. 3(c) and 4(c)], the hcp site [Figs. 3(d) and\n4(d)] and the fcc site [Figs. 3(e) and 4(e)]. The LDOS for the s-band of H atoms are also\nshown in appropriate figures. As expected, the LDOS for the Pt atoms on the clean\nsurface display features which are different from those in the bulk. In particular the dband is found to contract for the surface atoms, and the LDOS is reduced in the lower\nenergy region. More precisely, from Figs. 3(a), 3(b), 4(a), and 4(b) we find that the three\nPt d-bands, dxz , dyz , and dz2 are most affected by the creation of the surface and lose\nstates in the energy range -7 eV to -4 eV. However, the peaks in the LDOS around EF of\nthe Pt atoms on the clean surface appear to be similar to those of the atoms in the bulk.\nFor top-site H adsorption, shown in Figs. 3(c) and 4(c), the lost bonds of the Pt atoms on\nthe clean (111) surface are recovered partly through the hybridization of the 1s states of\nH with the dz2 states of Pt. There is a remarkable depletion of the dz2 states near EF and\nseveral new peaks appear both below (5 \u2013 7 eV) and above (~2 eV) the Fermi level. Figs.\n3(c) and 4(c) also reveal that the dxz, dyz and dx2-y2 states of Pt are not significantly\naffected by H adsorption in the top site.\n\n8\n\n\fThe effect of H adsorption in the hollow sites on the LDOS of Pt surface atoms is\nsignificantly different from that for top-site adsorption. Figs. 3(d), 3(e), 4(d), and 4(e)\nattest to the contrast with the LDOS in Figs. 3(c) and 4(c), particularly in the\nhybridization of the H and Pt states. Additional peaks with contributions from dxz and\ndx2- y2 states of Pt appear between 8 eV and 6 eV below EF, in Figs. 3(d) and 3(e) for\nhollow site adsorption. These figures also show the strong hybridization of the Pt states\nwith those of H. Clearly the Pt 6s states also participate in the hybridization when H\nadsorbs in the hollow sites.\nThe charge density distribution corresponding to new peaks in the region -8 eV to -6\neV in Figs. 3(e) and 4(e) is shown in Fig. 5. The plane chosen for the side-view display in\nthe figure passes through the points labeled C-A in Fig. 1(a). The upper center of the\n\"chicken-leg\" shape is located at the center of the adsorbed H (in fcc hollow), and the\nother is in the outer shell of the Pt surface atom close to H. The asymmetry in the charge\ndistribution points to the difference in the contributions coming from H and Pt atoms.\nHowever, it is clear that the bonding charges are distributed along the line that connects\nH to the Pt atoms, and points to the strong H-Pt covalent bonding.\nE. Subsurface adsorption\n\nAs discussed in Introduction, the possibility of subsurface adsorption has been the\nsubject of several recent publications. Furthermore, it appears that in experiments the\nsaturation coverage may correspond to more than 1 ML which begs the question of where\nthe other monolayer goes. We have carried out calculations for several configurations for\nH coverage of 2 ML in which 1 ML remains on the surface (fcc-site) and 1 ML is\nabsorbed into the surface, between the first and second Pt layer. Such a configuration\nmay be feasible as H is known to go subsurface on several metal surfaces (for example,\nPd).16 In the case that the subsurface monolayer is absorbed in the octahedral position\nbelow the top layer as shown in Fig. 6, our calculations for the Brillouin zone center\nproduces two additional frequencies 50 meV and 106 meV. The wanted mode at 106\nmeV is the vertical vibration of the subsurface H with a small contribution from the\nvertical motion of the on-surface H. The mode at 50 meV consists of displacements of\nthe sub-surface H in the direction parallel to the surface. The in-plane and vertically\npolarized modes arising from the on-surface H atoms have frequencies of 72 meV and\n148 meV, respectively.\n\nV. CONCLUSION\nWe have calculated the phonon dispersion curves for H on Pt(111), using firstprinciples, total energy calculations based on a mixed-basis set and norm-conserving\npseudopotentials. Linear response theory and the harmonic approximation are invoked.\nAt 1 ML coverage of H on Pt(111), we find the preferred adsorption site to be the fcc\nhollow, at a height of 0.9 \u00c5, with a binding energy of 0.41 eV, although we cannot rule\nout adsorption at the hcp-site. In fact, our results show very slight difference in the\ncharacteristics of the phonon dispersion curves for H adsorption in the two hollow-site.\n9\n\n\fIn both cases, we find that H adsorption alters the force field of the surface through\nhybridization between the 1s states of H and dxz, dx2- y2, and 6s states of the Pt surface\natoms in such way that the lateral interaction between the Pt atoms on the H-covered\nsurface undergoes stiffening rather than softening which is exhibited by the clean Pt(111)\nsurface. As a result, vertically polarized surface modes are lowered in energy while those\npolarized parallel to the surface are raised in energy. This trend is present in the top-site\nH adsorption in which hybridization occurs between H 1s and Pt dz2 states, however, it is\nweaker than that for hollow-sites.\nFor H vibrations, we find the in-plane polarized mode at 74 meV, and the\nvertically polarized one at 143 meV, at the \u0393 point, for the fcc-site adsorption. The\ncorresponding frequencies for the hcp-site adsorption are 67 meV and 144 meV, while\nfor the on-top site adsorption, they are 47 meV and 277 meV. The H mode polarized\nperpendicular to the surface shows little dispersion along the two high symmetry\ndirections chosen in this study. The modes polarized parallel to the surface show some\ndispersion, particularly at the M point, and for hollow site adsorption. The frequency of\nthe Pt Rayleigh wave, at the zone boundaries, is reduced on H adsorption in all three\ncases. The Pt surface mode in the stomach gap disappears into the bulk band for hollow\nsite H adsorption and remains unshifted if H adsorbs on-top. These dispersion curves,\nhowever, do not reveal a mode around 112 meV as has been reported in experiments. Our\ncalculation at the \u0393 point for the subsurface configuration in which 1 ML remains on the\nsurface (fcc-site) and the subsurface monolayer is absorbed in the octahedral position\nbelow the top layer, produces the mysterious mode at 106 meV which is the vertical\nvibration of the subsurface H with a small contribution from the vertical motion of the\non-surface H. The two-state adsorption model based on the subsurface location appears to\nbe possibility.18 We await further experiments particularly on the dispersion of the\nsurface phonons of the H-Pt(111) system to provide further answers to the issue of H on\nPt(111).\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nThe work was supported in part by the US National Science Foundation, Grant\nCHE-0205064.
