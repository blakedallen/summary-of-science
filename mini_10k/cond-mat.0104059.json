INTRODUCTION\nThe enigma of high temperature superconductivity has produced a deluge of\nconceivable theories too numerous and diverse to list here. This plethora of theories are\nall plagued by the same problem that no critical temperatures (Tc) can be calculated\nuntil both the interaction and its strength are known. In the case of the low Tc metallics\nwhere the phonon interaction and the BCS theory (Bardeen et al , 1957) are well\nformulated, calculations are exceedingly difficult (Carbotte 1990) and consume\nconsiderable time and energy due to their complexity.\n\nIn conventional BCS\n\nsuperconductors, Cooper pairs bound by phonon interaction form with zero total spin\nand zero total angular momentum (s-wave), and BCS Tc calculations give satisfactory\nagreement with experiment for monatomic metals and for some ordered alloys.\nHowever, they are inapplicable to materials beyond the typical parameter ranges.\nBCS may also be inapplicable to a large number of both proposed and known\nunorthodox superconductors and superfluids. It appears inappropriate to the quasione-dimensional organic superconductors with side chains conceived by Little (1964),\nand possibly the hydrides proposed by Overhauser (1987). The recently discovered\nunorthodox superconductors such as the cuprates, bismuth oxides, organics, and at\nleast some heavy fermion superconductors fall outside the domain of the BCS theory\nbecause they have non-phonon pairing interactions. Recently, Hasuo et al (1993) report\nevidence of a Bose-Einstein (B-E) condensation of biexcitons in CuCl. The presence of a\nweak population of biexcitons in the K= 0 ground state seems to play an important role\nin the nucleation of the superfluid transition.\nIn superfluid 3He the non-phonon spin-flip mediated pairing has been clearly\nidentified, and pairing is in the triplet state of\n\nspin 1 with\n\np-wave total orbital angular momentum (Leggett 1975).\n\nThere is evidence for d-wave\n\nrather than s-wave pairing in the cuprates (Coffey and Coffey 1993). Pairing in some\nheavy fermion materials appears to be primarily d-wave mediated by antiferromagnetic\n\n\f-3fluctuations with the triplet spin state as for UPt3. There was a time when anything\nother than zero spin and zero angular momentum would have been inconceivable to\nmany.\nWith rare exceptions such as the prediction of superconductivity in high pressure\nphases of materials such as Si by Cohen and his colleagues (Erskine et al , 1986), the\ndiscovery of unorthodox as well as conventional superconductors has come neither\nfrom basic theory, nor from guidance from the microscopic principles of\nsuperconductivity.\n\nOne generalization that applies to the new materials is that they\n\nare increasingly complex. This may just be an example of the power of large numbers\nsince the number of possibilities increases greatly with complexity as the building\nblocks go from unaries to binaries to ternaries to quaternaries, etc. However, there may\nbe an optimum degree of complexity. London (1937) speculated that life may depend\non high Tc (Rabinowitz 1990a). Superconductivity in the simplest materials may not at\nall be representative of superconductivity in its entirety. The only significance that the\nearliest discoveries of superconductivity were in the simplest materials may simply be\nbecause they were the easiest to work with, rather than that this form of\nsuperconductivity is the most prevalent.\n\nA possibility worth considering, though it\n\ndoes not appear to be verifiable, is that all conducting materials could become\nsuperconducting if taken to sufficiently low temperatures.\nA seminal generalization is that to be superconductors or superfluids regardless of\ntheir simplicity or complexity and the nature of the pairing mechanism, they must all\nexhibit quantum condensation in phase space. In my opinion, this is the condition that\nthe entire diversity of materials and theories must obey. My position is that this\ncondition is sufficient for approximate calculations of Tc, without the need for knowing\nthe interaction. The interaction-free approach initiated by Rabinowitz (1987, 1988,\n1989a,b, 1990b, 1993a,b) leads to simple formulas which work exceedingly well with\ngreat computational ease. They can be of benefit as a guide to the development of more\n\n\f-4rigorous and complete theories, as well as in the quest for new and better\nsuperconductors.\n2. QUANTUM CONDENSATION\nQuantum condensation in phase space leads to the formation of a quantum fluid\nwhich can exhibit macroscopic quantum effects such as superconductivity and\nsuperfluidity. In simple terms, it is the multiple occupancy (degeneracy) of available\nenergy levels.\n\nPreviously, I used the condition (Rabinowitz, 1989a) that the thermal de\n\nBroglie wavelength \u03bb must be greater than the inter-particle Boson spacing d. For\ngreater generality, and to be more explicit, let us allow that there may be more than one\nkind of Boson associated with different spin states\n\u22121/3\n\uf8eb nB \uf8f6\n\u03bb \u2265 2d = 2\uf8ec \uf8f7\n\uf8ed g\uf8f8\n\n(1)\n\nwhere n B is the total 3D number density of bosons, and g is the spin degeneracy so that\nn B / g is the number density of bosons of a given kind.\nLet us see that equation (1) is equivalent to multiple occupancy of energy levels.\nBriefly, without going into a lot of extraneous detail, for a free carrier model the 3D\ndensity of states for both spins (per unit energy per unit volume) is\n3/2\nE1/2 \uf8eb 2m \uf8f6\nG 3D =\n,\n(2)\n2\u03c0 2 \uf8ed h2 \uf8f8\nwhere m is the effective mass, and E is a given energy level. We require that the\nnumber of specific particles per energy level > 1:\n3/2\nV(n B / g) n B \uf8ee 3\u03c0 2 \uf8eb h2 \uf8f6 \uf8f9 3\u03bb3 \uf8eb n B \uf8f6\n=\n\uf8ef 3/2 \uf8ec\n\uf8f7 \uf8fa=\n\uf8ec \uf8f7 > 1.\nV \u222b G 3D dE g \uf8ef\uf8f0 E \uf8ed 2m \uf8f8 \uf8fa\uf8fb 8\u03c0 \uf8ed g \uf8f8\nEquation (3) implies\n\u22121/3\n> \uf8eb nB \uf8f6\n\u03bb ~ 2\uf8ec \uf8f7\n= 2d\n\uf8ed g\uf8f8\n\n(3)\n\n(4)\n\nin agreement with equation (1). Alder and Peters (1989) using quantum Monte Carlo\ncalculations have shown the variability of the coefficient linking \u03bb and d.\n\n\f-5-\n\n3. TRANSITION TEMPERATURES\n3.1. Superfluid Liquid 4He\nThe de Broglie wavelength at the thermal energy (f/2)\u03baTc is\n\u03bb = h / [ 2m B (f / 2)\u03baT c ] .\nm B is the effective boson mass, f is the degrees of freedom, and\nconstant. Combining equations (1) and (5) we obtain\n2/3\nh2 \uf8eb nB \uf8f6\nBE\nTc \u2264\n12m\u03ba \uf8ec\uf8ed g \uf8f7\uf8f8\n\n(5)\n\u03ba is the Boltzmann\n\n(6)\n\nin close agreement with the B-E condensation temperature (Betts, 1969) where the 12 is\nreplaced with 11.92. Equation (6) works well for 4He which is a boson of zero spin with\ng = 1, m \u2248 6.7 x 10-24 gm , and n B = 2.2 x 1022 /cm 3 , yielding T cBE \u2248 3 K in good\nagreement with the superfluid transition temperature of 2.17 K for L4He (Rabinowitz,\n1993a).\n3.1. Superfluid Atomic H\nHelium is unique among the elements as the only one exhibiting superfluidity\nsince it remains in the liquid state down to the lowest temperatures obtainable because\nof its very weak interaction, and because its zero point amplitude is high enough to\nkeep it from solidifying. Although hydrogen has a higher zero point energy, it\nsolidifies because it has much stronger interaction.\nSince hydrogen is a boson, let us see roughly at what temperature LH2 might\nbecome a superfluid if it could remain a fluid. Equation (6) says that the best we could\nhope for would be T cBE ~ 6 K for n ~ 2 x 1022/cm3 and m = 2(1.67 x 10-24 gm). Since this\nis below the solidification temperature for H 2 of 14.1 K, superfluidity appears out of the\nquestion for LH2. However, recent cooling achievements for H atoms of T \u2248 100 \u03bcK\n(Doyle et al , 1991) at a density of n = 8 x 1013/cm3 present two exciting possibilities for\nsuperfluidity. For the singlet state, at this density T cBE ~ 29.5 \u03bcK, not that much lower\n\n\f-6than what has already been achieved. For a triplet state, T cBE ~ 14.2 \u03bcK.\n3.2. Superfluid Liquid 3He\nUsing this paradigm, we can derive Tc for superfluid 3He. This derivation is\nmore general and different than previously done by Rabinowitz (1993a). 3 He is a\nfermion of spin 1/2. It obeys the Pauli\nexclusion principle, and hence only a fraction of the fermions ~ \u03baTc/EF are incipient\nCooper pairs at Tc , where\n\uf8ee h 2 n 2/3 \uf8f9\nEF = \uf8ef\n(7)\n(3 / \u03c0)2/3\n\uf8fa\n\uf8f0 8m \uf8fb\nis the Fermi energy, m is the fermion effective mass, and n is the number density of\nfermions. This is similar to electrons in which only ~ \u03baT/EF participate in the electron\nspecific heat. The number of fermions involved is the number of k values within a shell\n\u2206k of energy width\n2\n2\nh2 k F2 h (k F \u2212 \u2206k )\n\u03baT cF \u2248\n\u2212\n,\n(8)\n2m\n2m\nwhere k = 1/ D = p / h is the wave vector. For a roughly spherical Fermi surface the\nnumber density of bosons of a specific kind is\n\u2206k(4\u03c0k 2 )\n1\nF n = 3\u2206k n .\nn =\n(9)\nB 2 4 3\n\u03c0k g\n2k\ng\n3 F\nF\nCombining equations (8) and (9),\n3\u03baT\nc3 n.\nn =\n(10)\nB 4E g\nF\nFor layered materials the Fermi surface is cylindrical, yielding a coefficient of 1/2\ninstead of 3/4 in eq. (10). However if the fraction of fermions ~ (3/2)kTc/EF rather than\n~kTc/EF , then a cylindrical Fermi\nsurface would also yield eq.(10).\nFor 3He pairs, \u03bb is given by equation (5) with mB= 2m, and f \u2265 3 in 3D.\nCombining equations (1), (5), (7) and (10)\n3D\n\uf8ee h 2 n 2/3 \uf8f9\n\u22122 \uf8eb T F \uf8f6\n=\n2.28\nx10\nT c 3 = 2.77 x10 \u22123 \uf8ef\n\uf8ec g2 \uf8f7 ,\n2 \uf8fa\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\n\uf8f0 m\u03bag \uf8fb\n3D\nwhere T F = EF / \u03ba .\n\n(11)\n\nFor 3He pairs, g = 3, since the spin = 1. One may calculate the number density of\n\n\f-7L 3 He as n = 2.36 x 1022 /cm 3 at the solid liquid interface from both the independent\ndata of Wheatley (1975) at 34.36 bar and of Greywall (1986) at 34.39 bar. At these\npressures, Wheatley gives m = 6.22 m 3 , and Greywall m = 5.85 m 3 . Using\nHe\n\nHe\n\nWheatley's data, equation (11) yields T c3 = 2.6 mK in excellent agreement with his\nexperimental value of 2.6 mK. Using Greywall's data, equation (11) yields Tc3 = 2.8 mK\nalso in excellent agreement with his experimental value of 2.5 mK.\nA private\ncommunication (1993) by D. D. Osheroff indicates that the originally measured value of\nTc3 = 2.6 mK (Osheroff, 1972), should be corrected to Tc3 = 2.5 mK.\nOriginal predictions of Tc were ~0.1 K, and then fell to 10-6-10-9 K, when the 3He\nsuperfluid transition was not found down to 0.01 K (Rabinowitz 1993). My theory\nmakes the prediction that the superfluid transition temperature for dilute solutions of\n3 He\n\nin superfluid 4 He are ~ 1- 10 \u03bcK (Rabinowitz, 1993a) Winterberg (1989) has\n\nspeculated on the possibility of a superfluid B-E condensation of photons.\n\n4. HIGH TEMPERATURE SUPERCONDUCTIVITY\nWe can use eq. (11) as the starting point for deriving Tc for high-Tc\nsuperconductors as well as other superconductors which exhibit a 2D layered structure.\nCombining equations. (1), (7), (10) and (11) with f = 2 in eq. (5) yields\n2D\n3D\n\uf8ee h 2 n 2/3 \uf8f9\n\uf8f9\n\u22122 \uf8ee T F\n\u22122 \uf8ee T F \uf8f9\n=\n5.22\nx10\n=\n3.42x10\n(12)\nT c 2 = 4.15 x10 \u22123 \uf8ef\n\uf8ef 1/3 2 \uf8fa\n\uf8ef 2 \uf8fa,\n2 \uf8fa\n\uf8f0 m\u03bag \uf8fb\n\uf8f0 n \u03b4g \uf8fb\n\uf8f0g \uf8fb\nwhere g = 1 for singlet pairing (spin = 0) superconductors, T F2D = EF2D / \u03ba, and \u03b4 is the\naverage plane spacing. For direct input of experimental data, eq. (12) can also be\nwritten in terms of the three dimensional density of electronic states in the normal\nphase for both spins G3D(\u03bc) at the chemical potential \u03bc (Fermi energy):\n\uf8ee h 6 [G 3D (\u03bc )]2 \uf8f9\n\uf8fa.\nT c 2 = 2.71x10 \uf8ef\n3 2\n\uf8ef\uf8f0 \u03bam g\n\uf8fa\uf8fb\n\u22125\n\n(13)\n\nHowever eq. (12) in terms of the single input parameter T F3D is the simplest\npossible expression for T c , when it is available. In my\n\n\f-8theory, the quantity h 2 n 2/3 / m\u03ba always enters in this form, making possible its\nreplacement with T F3D . Unfortunately, a rich source of valuable data compiled by\nHarshman and Mills (HM) (1992) only lists T F3D for a small number of superconductors.\nInstead they list most in terms of T F2D which is why equation (12) is also given in terms\nof T F2D .\nFor the metallic superconductors, we can make a small correction to the equation\nfor Tc previously derived (Rabinowitz 1989b equation (5)) . The 3/4 in equation (10)\nabove enters in as (3/4)2 times the original expression and including g with f = 3 yields\n3D\n\uf8ee h 2 n 2/3 \uf8f9\n\u22124 \uf8ee T F \uf8f9\n=\n3.26\nx10\n(14)\nT cm = 4.07 x10 \u22125 \uf8ef\n\uf8ef 2 \uf8fa.\n2 \uf8fa\n\uf8f0 m\u03bag \uf8fb\n\uf8f0g \uf8fb\nTable I tabulates the predicted transition temperatures T cpred and the necessary\ninput data for a wide variety of superconductors for comparison with the experimental\n3He is calculated from equation (11) using Greywall's data. H and 4He are\nvalues T exp\nc .\n\ndetermined from equation (6). Sixteen superconductors (No's.6-9 &19-30) are calculated\nfrom equation (12) inclusive of all the cuprate, organic, bismuth oxide, dichalcogenide\nsuperconductors from data in HM. No.5 (heavy fermion with g=3), and No's. 17 & 18\nare calculated from eq.(11) as they are 3D superconductors. The remaining seven\nmetallics are determined using eq. (14). In all cases every single superconductor in HM\nis presented for which there is sufficient data to make a calculation, which accounts for\nall the entries except H, He, and the six pure metals. The EF for the six pure\nsuperconducting metals can be\nfound in most solid state textbooks. The data indicates that for the metallics my simple\ntheory requires modification with increased convolution. Although three significant\nfigures are not usually warranted, they are presented in case they might be needed for\ncomputational purposes. The agreement between T cpred and T exp\nis exceptionally good\nc\nfor 21 out of 28 superconductors-fluids. T exp\nis not known for two entries.\nc\n\nThe\n\nagreement is even better than the table shows, when Tcis calculated directly from n and\nm -- possibly because of different uncertainties in T F2D and \u03b4 than ascribed to them.\n\n\f-95. COHERENCE LENGTHS\nThe concept of coherence applies both to particles and to waves. From a classical\npoint of view, we could focus on the coherent motion of electron pairs in\nsuperconductivity or neutral carriers in superfluidity. In the BCS theory, the correlated\nmotion of the electrons in a Cooper pair with equal and opposite momenta allow the\ncenter of mass to move undisturbed because as one electron scatters the other is\nrequired to scatter in the opposite direction. Quantum mechanically the concept of\ncoherence applies to a correlation between phases of the wave function at all points in\nspace. The particles have condensed into\nthe ground state described by one wave function. It is as if they were all acting like a\nsingle body. With the low energy states filled, it is as if there were no available states to\nfall down to, so scattering cannot lead to energy loss.\nIn simple physical terms, the concept of coherence length, \u03be, can be looked at in\nthree different ways. The simplest way is to think of \u03be as the rms distance between the\nelectrons in a Cooper pair as they oscillate 180o out of phase about their center of mass.\nA second physical meaning of \u03be relates to the quantum of flux (fluxoid) in a\nsuperconductor or vortex in a superfluid, with radius ~ \u03be.\nThe third is related to the fact that the superconducting electrons are in a more\nordered (more coherent) state than the normal electrons.\nPippard identified the change in density, ns, of superconducting electrons with this\norder. In the metallics \u03be ~ 103 - 104 \u00c5 implying that there are billions of electron pairs\nwithin a volume \u03be3 . The long \u03be with large overlap of pairs makes pair-pair interactions\ngreatest in the metallics, and least applicable to the interaction-free approach.\n\nIn the\n\ncuprates \u03be ~ 5- 20\u00c5, so there are only a small number of electron pairs within a\ncoherence volume with little pair-pair interaction.\nAlthough the primary motivation of my approximate theory is to calculate\ntransition temperatures, a fringe benefit is that it can also yield approximate values of\n\n\f-10the low temperature coherence length \u03be that agree roughly with the metallics, and quite\nwell with the cuprates. In simple terms the uncertainty principle \u03b4E \u03b4t \u2265 h/ 2 can be\napplied in the region of the low temperature energy gap\nFermi velocity. This implies that\n\n\u03be=\n\n2\u2206 = \u03b4E , and \u03b4t = \u03be / v F where vF is the\n\n\u03be = hv F / 4\u2206 . Rigorously one would get,\n\nhv F\n.\n\u03c0\u2206\n\n(15)\n\nFor the metallics BCS has\n\n2\u2206 = 3.52kT c . Combining this with equations (7) and (14) in (15):\n\n\u03be met = 700n \u22121/3 .\n\n(16)\n\nWith n ~ 10 23 /cm 3 , equation (16) gives \u03bemet ~ 2000 \u00c5 in fair agreement with the\nexperimental range of ~103 - 104 \u00c5 .\nFor the cuprates 2\u2206 ~ 8kT c (Rabinowitz 1989a). Combining this with equations\n(7) and (12) in (15):\n\u03be cup = 3n \u22121/3\n\n(17)\n\nWith n ~ 10 22/cm 3, equation (17) yields \u03bemet ~ 14 \u00c5 in excellent agreement with the\nexperimental range of ~5 - 20 \u00c5 .\n6. RETROSPECTION AND CONCLUSION\nAlthough Ogg (1946) first proposed electron pairs for superconductivity, electron\npairs should rightfully be called Cooper pairs. The pairing idea was proposed many\ntimes (Blatt 1964) long before Cooper (1956) proposed it. Nevertheless, Cooper was the\nfirst to quantify the problem of two Fermions interacting in the presence of a filled\nFermi sea of N - 2 other Fermions.\nMy analysis clearly differs from that of BCS (1957). B-E condensation approaches\nto superconductivity were first presented by Schafroth (1955), and Schafroth, Butler,\nand Blatt (SBB) (1957); and more recently by Friedberg and Lee (1989).\n\nThese\n\napproaches differ from mine, and appear not to have been successful in predicting Tc's.\n(Standard approaches have also been unsuccessful with high-Tc's.) I was not aware of\nthe SBB work when my earlier papers were written. They showed that if the size of the\nelectron pairs is less than the average distance between them, and if other conditions\n\n\f-11are fulfilled, the system has properties similar to that of a charged Bose-Einstein gas,\nincluding a Meissner effect and a critical temperature of condensation. However, the\nSBB approach did not lead to T c predictions, and is much more elaborate than my\ntheory.\nThe original BCS paper (1957) was not without some shortcomings.It did not\npredict the mixed state of type II superconductivity. It\nincorrectly predicted that a small amount of impurity scattering would greatly reduce\nTc. Nevertheless, it proved to be extremely valuable.\nThe simplicity of my theory is both a source of strength and weakness. The\nsimplicity invariably leads to limitations. Nevertheless it has impressive power to\ncorrelate data over a wide range without explicitly introducing a pairing mechanism.\nPerhaps this should not be entirely surprising, as T c\n\nitself is a measure of the\n\ninteraction strength. In this model, Tc enters into the equations in two different ways so\nthat it is possible to solve for Tc. It is a kind of self-consistency requirement that the\nnumber of pairs that B-E condense (i.e. those having a de Broglie wavelength\ncomparable to their average separation) is proportional to the condensation\ntemperature itself. This may be why the transition temperature can be obtained without\nprior knowledge of the interaction mechanism, presenting a necessary but not sufficient\ncondition for superconductivity. Even though thermodynamically there is only one Tc\nfor a given material, Tc\u221d1/m suggests that a significantly higher effective mass in the c\ndirection for layered 2D materials than in the ab plane implies that there is an\nintrincically lower T cc in the c direction than T cab in the ab planes. This would be like\nhaving parallel superconducting sheets with normal connections in the perpendicular\ndirection for T cab > T > T cc . However, coupling of the ab planes such as by the Josephson\nand/or proximity effects may mask the difference between T cab and T cc . Resistivity\nmeasurements as a function of T in the ab and c directions for a single crystal should be\nable to detect a difference in Tc.\n\n\f-12ACKNOWLEDGMENT\nI wish to express my heartfelt appreciation to Tom McMullen for bringing the\nHarshman and Mills paper to my attention, for helping me with the numerical\ncalculations, for beneficial discussions, and most of all for his integrity, his valuable\ninterest, his encouragement, and his support.\nREFERENCES\nAlder, B.
