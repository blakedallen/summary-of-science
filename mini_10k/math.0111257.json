It is well\nknown that every graph without isolated vertices has dom(G) \u2265 2. For every k, it is known\nthat there are graphs with minimum degree at least k and with dom(G) = 2. In this paper\nwe prove that this is not the case if G is k-regular or almost k-regular (by \"almost\" we mean\nthat the minimum degree is k and the maximum degree is at most Ck for some fixed real\nnumber C \u2265 1). In this case we prove that dom(G) \u2265 (1 + ok (1))k/(2 ln k). We also prove that\nthe order of magnitude k/ ln k cannot be improved. One cannot replace the constant 2 with a\nconstant smaller than 1. The proof uses the so called semi-random method which means that\ncombinatorial objects are generated via repeated applications of the probabilistic method; in\nour case iterative applications of the Lov\u00e1sz Local Lemma.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nAll graphs considered here are finite, undirected and simple. For standard graph-theoretic terminology the reader is referred to [3]. A subset D of vertices in a graph G is a dominating set if every\nvertex not in D has a neighbor in D. The domatic number of a graph G, denoted dom(G), is the\nmaximum number of colors in a (not necessarily proper) vertex coloring of G, where each color\nclass is a dominating set. The theory of domination and the domatic number are well studied areas\nin graph theory and theoretical computer science. The two books [7, 8] present most of the known\nresults in domination theory. The domatic number was first defined in [4].\nClearly, every graph has a dominating set. Thus, let \u03b3(G) denote the minimum possible cardinality of a dominating set. It is an easy observation that every graph without isolated vertices\nhas dom(G) \u2265 2. Simply take a dominating set D with |D| = \u03b3(G) and notice that V (G) \\ D\nis also a dominating set. On the other hand, deciding whether dom(G) > 2 is an NP-Complete\nproblem [6]. It is well known [9] that if a graph has high minimum degree, then \u03b3(G) is small.\n1\n\n\fThis, however, does not necessarily mean that dom(G) is large. Zelinka [10] proved that for every\nk, there are graphs with minimum degree k and with dom(G) = 2. In his examples, there are\nalways (relatively) few vertices with very high degree. This is unavoidable. In this paper we show\nthat if we only consider the class of graphs with minimum degree k and maximum degree at most\nCk, for some constant C \u2265 1 (in particular, regular graphs), then, in fact, dom(G) is guaranteed\nto be quite large.\nBefore we present our main result we need a definition. Let k be a positive integer and let\nC \u2265 1 be a real number. A graph G is called (k, C)-regular if \u03b4(G) = k and \u2206(G) \u2264 kC. In\nparticular, a (k, 1)-regular graph is a k-regular graph. Let f (k, C) denote the minimum possible\nvalue of dom(G) taken over all (k, C)-regular graphs. For example, f (2, C) = 2 as seen be any cycle\nwhose number of vertices is not divisible by 3. Also, f (3, C) = 2 as seen by the 3-regular graph\nwith 8 vertices consisting of a Hamiltonian cycle and four edges connecting antipodal vertices of\nthe cycle. In general, determining f (k, C) precisely seems to be a very difficult task. Our main\nresult is summarized in the following two theorems:\nTheorem 1.1 Let C \u2265 1 be a fixed real number. Then,\nf (k, C) \u2265\n\nk\n(1 + ok (1)).\n2 ln k\n\nTheorem 1.2 Let C > 1 be a fixed real number. Then,\nf (k, C) \u2264\n\nk\n(1 + ok (1)).\nln k\n\nAlthough Theorem 1.1 and Theorem 1.2 show, in particular, that the order of magnitude of f (k, C)\nis k/ ln k for any fixed C > 1, the constants are worthy of investigation. In fact, although the proof\nof Theorem 1.1 is significantly more difficult than the proof of Theorem 1.2 we conjecture that the\nlatter is the correct answer\nConjecture 1.3 Let C \u2265 1 be a fixed real number. Then,\nf (k, C) =\n\nk\n(1 + ok (1)).\nln k\n\nIn the next two sections we present the proofs of Theorem 1.1 and Theorem 1.2. The proof\nof theorem 1.1 demonstrates the so called semi-random method (an unofficial term the author\nheard several times by researchers in the area of probabilistic methods in combinatorics). In this\nmethod, combinatorial objects (such as graph colorings) are generated via repeated applications\nof the probabilistic method; in the case of Theorem 1.1, iterative applications of the Lov\u00e1sz Local\nLemma. The proof of Theorem 1.2 is demonstrated by exhibiting an appropriate random graph.\nA final note: Proving an analog of Theorem 1.1 with the constant 3 instead of 2 is a significantly\neasier task. In fact, a naive application of the Local Lemma does the job. Assume you have\n2\n\n\fabout t = \u230ak/(3 ln k)\u230b colors. Let each vertex choose a random color independently with uniform\ndistribution. Let Av,i denote the event that the vertex v misses the color i in its closed neighborhood.\nThe probability of Av,i is less than 1/k3 . But C 2 k3 / ln k is also an upper bound for the number\nof events which Av,i depends upon, since if u and v are at distance 3 or more from each other,\nAv,i is independent of Au,j (they do not have common neighbors). The total number of vertices at\ndistance 2 is at most kC + k2 C 2 and there are t colors, so the dependency digraph has maximum\ndegree (kC + k2 C 2 )k/(3 ln k). Now the conditions of the Local Lemma hold, and thus with positive\nprobability no Av,i holds. Hence each color class is a dominating set. This naive approach fails, of\ncourse, for any constant smaller than 3, so additional ideas must be sought.\n\n2\n\nProof of Theorem 1.1\n\nIn the proof of Theorem 1.1 we need to use the Lov\u00e1sz Local Lemma [5]. Here it is, following the\nnotations in [2] (which also contains a simple proof of the lemma). Let A1 , . . . , An be events in an\narbitrary probability space. A directed graph D = (V, E) on the set of vertices V = [n] is called a\ndependency digraph for the events A1 , . . . , An if for each i, i = 1, . . . , n, the event Ai is mutually\nindependent of all the events {Aj : (i, j) \u2208\n/ E}.\nLemma 2.1 (The Local Lemma, symmetric version) Let A1 , . . . , An be events in an arbitrary probability space and let D = (V, E) be a corresponding dependency digraph. If the maximum\noutdegree in D is at most d \u2265 1 and each Ai has Pr[Ai ] \u2264 p and p(d + 1) \u2264 1/e then with positive\nprobability no event Ai holds.\nProof of Theorem 1.1: Let C \u2265 1 be fixed, and let \u01eb > 0. in order to avoid cluttered computations we shall assume, wherever necessary, that k is sufficiently large as a function of C and \u01eb only.\nLet k be sufficiently large such that there is an integer between k/((2+\u01eb) ln k) and k/((2+\u01eb/2) ln k).\nThus, for some \u01eb/2 \u2264 \u03b3 \u2264 \u01eb, The number t = k/((2 + \u03b3) ln k) is an integer. Let G = (V, E) be\na (k, C)-regular graph. We need to show that dom(G) \u2265 t. This will show, in particular, that\ndom(G) \u2265 k/((2 + \u01eb) ln k) and consequently, f (k, C) \u2265 (k/2 ln k)(1 + ok (1)).\nAssume that we have the set of colors {0, 1, . . . , t}. We call color 0 the transparent color. In\nthe first phase of the proof we color the vertices using all colors such that certain very specific\nproperties hold. In the second phase we recolor the vertices that received the transparent color in\nthe first phase using only the non-transparent colors and show that we can do it carefully enough\nsuch that each non-transparent color class (after the second phase) is a dominating set.\nWe begin with a description of the first phase. Our goal in the first phase is to achieve a coloring\nwith the following properties:\nLemma 2.2 There exists a coloring of G with the colors {0, 1, . . . , t} such that the following conditions hold:\n3\n\n\f1. Every vertex has at least k\u03b3/(4(2 + \u03b3)) neighbors with transparent color.\n2. Every vertex has at most 4 non-transparent colors missing from its (open) neighborhood.\n3. Put z = \u230812/\u03b3\u2309. For each v \u2208 V , and for each sequence of z distinct non-transparent colors\nc1 , . . . , cz and for each sequence of z distinct neighbors of v denoted u1 , . . . , uz , at least one\nui has a neighbor colored ci .\nProof: We let each vertex v \u2208 V choose one color from {0, 1, . . . , t} randomly. The probability to\nchoose color i is p = (2 + \u03b3/2) ln k/k for i = 1, . . . , t and the probability to choose the transparent\ncolor is, therefore, q = 1 \u2212 pt = \u03b3/(2(2 + \u03b3)). Let Av denote the event that v has less than kq/2\nneighbors colored with the transparent color. Let Bv denote the event that v has more than 4 nontransparent colors missing from its neighborhood. Let Cv denote the event that v has z neighbors\nu1 , . . . , uz and there exist z distinct non-transparent colors c1 , . . . , cz , such that ci is missing from\nthe neighborhood of ui for each i = 1, . . . , z. Thus, we need to show that with positive probability,\nnone of the 3|V | events Av ,Bv and Cv , for each v \u2208 V , hold. The following three claims provide\nupper bounds for the probabilities of the events Av ,Bv and Cv , respectively.\nClaim 2.3 Pr[Av ] < 1/k 5 .\nProof: Let Xv denote the random variable counting the number of transparent neighbors of v.\nThe expectation of Xv is E[Xv ] = dv q \u2265 kq, where dv denotes the degree of v. Since each vertex\nchooses its color independently we have by the most common Chernoff inequality (cf. [2])\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0015\nkq\nE[Xv ]\nPr [Av ] = Pr Xv <\n\u2264 Pr Xv <\n<\n2\n2\n1\n.\nk5\n(In the final inequality we used the fact that q is a constant depending on \u03b3 and that k is sufficiently\nlarge).\n2 /d\nv\n\ne\u22122(E[Xv ]/2)\n\n2 2 /(2d )\nv\n\n= e\u2212dv q\n\n= e\u2212dv q\n\n2 /2\n\n< e\u2212kq\n\n2 /2\n\n<<\n\nClaim 2.4 Pr[Bv ] < 1/k5 .\nProof: Fix 5 distinct non-transparent colors. The probability that none of them appear in the\nneighborhood of v is precisely (1 \u2212 5p)dv . Now,\n\u0012\n\u0013\n5(2 + \u03b32 ) ln k k\n1\nk\ndv\n(1 \u2212 5p) \u2264 (1 \u2212 5p) = 1 \u2212\n< 10+2.5\u03b3 .\nk\nk\n\u0001\nAs there are 5t possible sets of 5 distinct non-transparent colors we get that\n\u0012 \u0013\n1\n1\nt\n1\n< 5+2.5\u03b3 < 5 .\nPr[Bv ] <\n10+2.5\u03b3\nk\nk\n5 k\n\n4\n\n\fClaim 2.5 Pr[Cv ] < 1/k5 .\nProof: For a vertex u and a color c let n(u, c) denote the number of neighbors of u colored c. Fix\na set of z distinct non-transparent colors {c1 , . . . , cz } and z distinct neighbors of v, {u1 , . . . , uz }.\nWe begin by computing the probability that for each i = 1, . . . , z, ci does not appear in the\nneighborhood of ui (i.e. n(ui , ci ) = 0). Denoting this probability by \u03c1 = \u03c1(v, u1 , . . . , uz , c1 , . . . , cz )\nwe clearly have:\n\u03c1 = Pr[n(u1 , c1 ) = 0] * Pr[n(u2 , c2 ) = 0 | n(u1 , c1 ) = 0] * . . .\n. . . * Pr[n(uz , cz ) = 0 | n(u1 , c1 ) = 0 \u2227 * * * \u2227 n(uz\u22121 , cz\u22121 ) = 0].\nFor the first term we have Pr[n(u1 , c1 ) = 0] = (1 \u2212 p)du1 . For the other terms we claim that\nPr[n(ui , ci ) = 0 | n(u1 , c1 ) = 0 \u2227 * * * \u2227 n(ui\u22121 , ci\u22121 ) = 0] \u2264 (1 \u2212 p)dui .\nThis is obvious since the knowledge that a color from {c1 , . . . , ci\u22121 } does not appear in a neighbor\ncommon to ui and some ui\u2032 for i\u2032 < i only increases the probability that ci is in the neighborhood of\nui , and hence decreases the probability that n(ui , ci ) = 0. To be precise, if wi,1 , . . . , wi,dui are the\nneighbors of ui , let s(j) denote the size of the intersection of N (wi,j ) with {u1 , . . . , ui\u22121 }. Clearly\n0 \u2264 s(j) \u2264 i \u2212 1 < z < t. The probability that wi,j is colored with ci given that n(ul , cl ) = 0 for\nl = 1, . . . , i\u22121 is precisely p/(q+(t\u2212s(j))p). Recalling that q+tp = 1 we have p/(q+(t\u2212s(j))p) \u2265 p.\nThus,\n\u0012\n\u0013\np\ndui\nPr[n(ui , ci ) = 0 | n(u1 , c1 ) = 0 \u2227 * * * \u2227 n(ui\u22121 , ci\u22121 ) = 0] = \u03a0j=1 1 \u2212\n\u2264 (1\u2212p)dui .\nq + (t \u2212 s(j))p\nWe therefore have:\n\u03c1 \u2264 \u03a0zi=1 (1 \u2212 p)dui \u2264 (1 \u2212 p)kz .\nThere are less than (Ck)z ordered sets of z distinct neighbors of v. There are less than tz ordered\nsets of z distinct non-transparent colors. Thus,\nPr[Cv ] < tz (Ck)z (1 \u2212 p)kz \u2264 C z k2z (1 \u2212\nC z k2z\n\n1\nkz(2+\u03b3/2)\n\n=\n\n2 + (\u03b3/2) ln k kz\n) <\nk\n\nCz\nC 13/\u03b3\n1\n<\n< 5.\n6\nz\u03b3/2\nk\nk\nk\n\nHaving proved Pr[Av ] < 1/k5 , Pr[Bv ] < 1/k5 and Pr[Cv ] < 1/k5 we claim that we can use the\nLocal Lemma to show that with positive probability none of these events hold. Indeed, fix a\nvertex v and let Uv be the set of all vertices at distance 5 or greater from v. Notice that if\nu \u2208 Uv , the neighbors of v and their neighborhoods do not intersect the neighbors of u and their\nneighborhoods. Since Av only depends on v and its neighbors, Bv depends only on v and its\n5\n\n\fneighbors and Cv only depends on v, its neighbors and the neighbors of its neighbors, we have\nthat Av is mutually independent of all the 3|Uv | events {Au , Bu , Cu | u \u2208 Uv }. Similarly Bv and\nCv are mutually independent of all the event {Au , Bu , Cu | u \u2208 Uv }. Since there are at most\n1 + kC + kC(kC \u2212 1) + kC(kC \u2212 1)2 + kC(kC \u2212 1)3 < k 4 C 4 vertices at distance at most 4 from v\n(including v), we have that the maximum outdegree in the dependency digraph of the 3|V | events is\nat most 3k4 C 4 . Since (1/k5 )*(3k4 C 4 + 1) < 1/e we get by Lemma 2.1 that with positive probability\nnone of the events hold. We therefore proved Lemma 2.2.\nWe now describe the second phase. We fix a coloring satisfying the three conditions in the\nstatement of Lemma 2.2. For a vertex v, let F (v) denote the set of missing non-transparent colors\nfrom its neighborhood. By Lemma 2.2 we know that |F (v)| \u2264 4. Now, let S(v) = \u222au\u2208N (v) F (u).\nWe claim that |S(v)| \u2264 4(z \u2212 1). To see this, notice that if |S(v)| > 4(z \u2212 1) this means that\nthere are at least z distinct neighbors of u, each missing a distinct color from their neighborhood,\ncontradicting the third condition in Lemma 2.2. In the second phase we only color the vertices\nthat received transparent colors in the first phase. Let v be a vertex colored with the transparent\ncolor. We let v choose a random color from S(v) with uniform distribution. The choices made\nby distinct vertices are independent (In case S(v) = \u2205 we can assign an arbitrary non-transparent\ncolor to v). Let v \u2208 V be any vertex, and let c \u2208 F (v). Let Av,c denote the event that after the\nsecond phase, c still does not appear as a color in a neighbor of v. Our goal is to show that with\npositive probability, none of the events Av,c for v \u2208 V and c \u2208 F (v) hold. This will complete the\nproof of Theorem 1.1.\nLet Tv be the subset of neighbors of v given transparent color in the first phase. By Lemma 2.2\nwe have |Tv | \u2265 k\u03b3/(4(2 + \u03b3)). Assuming c does not appear in the neighborhood of v we have that\nfor each u \u2208 Tv , the color c appears in S(u). Hence,\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n1\nPr[Av,c ] = \u03a0u\u2208Tv 1 \u2212\n< \u03a0u\u2208Tv 1 \u2212\n<\n|S(u)|\n4z\n\u0012\n\n1\n1\u2212\n4z\n\n\u0013k\u03b3/(4(2+\u03b3))\n\n\u0010\n1\n\u03b3 \u0011k\u03b3/(4(2+\u03b3))\n<< 3 .\n< 1\u2212\n52\nk\n\nNow, for v \u2208 V , let Uv denote the set of all vertices at distance at least 3 from v. Since the event\nAv,c only depends on v and its (transparent) neighbors, we have that Av,c is mutually independent\nof all the events Au,c\u2032 for u \u2208 Uv and c\u2032 \u2208 F (u). Since the number of neighbors at distance at most 2\nfrom v is at most 1 + kC + kC(kC \u2212 1), including v, and since |F (u)| \u2264 4 for all u \u2208 V we have that\nthe outdegree in the dependency digraph of the events is at most 4(1 + kC + kC(kC \u2212 1)) < 5k2 C 2 .\nSince (1/k3 ) * (5k2 C 2 + 1) < 1/e we get by Lemma 2.1 that with positive probability none of the\nevents of the form Av,c hold. Hence, there is a coloring with the colors {1, . . . , t} such that each\ncolor class is a dominating set.\n\n6\n\n\f3\n\nProof of Theorem 1.2\n\nWe shall take the opportunity to prove something slightly stronger than the statement of Theorem\n1.2. The random graphs we shall construct to demonstrate the proof of Theorem 1.2 can also have\narbitrary large girth.\nTrivially, dom(G) \u2264 |V (G)|/\u03b3(G). Thus, it suffices to prove the following:\nTheorem 3.1 Let C > 1 be a fixed real number, and let g \u2265 2. For every \u01eb > 0, there exists a\nk0 = k0 (C, g, \u01eb) such that for all k > k0 , there exists a (k, C)-regular graph G with n vertices and\nwith girth(G) > g having \u03b3(G) \u2265 (1 \u2212 \u01eb)n ln k/k.\nA weaker theorem, in which we only require the graph G to have minimum degree k (i.e. C = \u221e)\nand we do not care about the girth (i.e. g = 2) follows immediately from a result of Alon [1].\nProof of Theorem 3.1: Put r = 2g + 1. Trivially, we may assume\n1 + \u01eb/4 < C , \u01eb < 1.\n\n(1)\n\nLet k0 be the minimal integer satisfying\n1.\nk0 \u2265\n\n48\n.\n\u01eb2\n\n(2)\n\n2.\n2\n\nk0 \u2265 6g * 8g .\n\n(3)\n\n3.

That is,\nevery edge appears, independently, with probability p. We shall prove the following three lemmas,\nwhich, together, supply the required result.\nLemma 3.2 With probability greater than 2/3, G has minimum degree at least k + 1 and maximum\ndegree at most kC.\n7\n\n\fLemma 3.3 With probability greater than 2/3, \u03b3(G) \u2265 (1 \u2212 \u01eb)n ln k/k.\nLemma 3.4 With probability greater than 2/3, any two cycles C and C \u2032 of G having at most g\nvertices each, are vertex disjoint.\nBy Lemmas 3.2, 3.3 and 3.4 we know that with positive probability there exists an n-vertex graph\nG that has minimum degree at least k + 1, maximum degree at most kC, has \u03b3(G) \u2265 (1 \u2212 \u01eb)n ln k/k\nand any two cycles in G whose lengths are at most g are vertex-disjoint. Thus, we can delete a\nsingle edge from each cycle whose length is at most g. The resulting graph is (k, C) \u2212 regular (no\nvertex lost more than one edge), has girth greater than g, and \u03b3(G) cannot decrease when we delete\nedges. This proves Theorem 3.1 and, consequently, Theorem 1.2.\nProof of Lemma 3.2: The proof of this lemma is almost trivial, and is based on standard large\ndeviation approximations. For v \u2208 V (G), let dv denote its degree in G(n, p). dv is a random variable\nwith the binomial distribution B(n\u22121, p). Thus, E[dv ] = (n\u22121)p = (kr \u22121)(1+\u01eb/8)/kr\u22121 . Clearly,\nby (2) k(1 + \u01eb/8) > E[dv ] > k(1 + \u01eb/12). We shall use the large deviation inequality of Chernoff\n(cf. [2]) that states that for all a > 0\n\u0012\n\u0013\na2\na3\nPr[|dv \u2212 E[dv ]| > a] < 2 exp \u2212\n+\n.\n2p(n \u2212 1) 2p2 (n \u2212 1)2\nUsing a = k\u01eb/16 and the last inequality we get, together with (4), that\n\u0013\n\u0012 2 2\n1\nk 3 \u01eb3\n1\nk \u01eb\n*\n+\n* 2\n=\nPr[|dv \u2212 E[dv ]| > k\u01eb/16] < 2 exp \u2212\n256 2k(1 + \u01eb/8) 4096 2k (1 + \u01eb/12)2\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\nk\u01eb3\nk\u01eb2\nk\u01eb2\n1\n+\n2 exp \u2212\n< 2 exp \u2212\n< r.\n512(1 + \u01eb/8) 8192(1 + \u01eb/12)2\n1024(1 + \u01eb/8)\n3k\nAs there are n = kr vertices in G we get that with probability greater than 1 \u2212 k r /(3kr ) = 2/3, all\nv \u2208 V satisfy |dv \u2212 E[dv ]| \u2264 k\u01eb/16. In particular, dv \u2265 E[dv ] \u2212 k\u01eb/16 \u2265 k(1 + \u01eb/12 \u2212 \u01eb/16) \u2265 k + 1,\nand dv \u2264 E[dv ]+k\u01eb/16 \u2264 k(1+\u01eb/8+\u01eb/16) < kC. Thus, with probability at least 2/3, the minimum\ndegree is at least k + 1 and the maximum degree is at most Ck.\nProof of Lemma 3.3: Let \u01eb/2 < \u03b1 < \u01eb be such that t = (1 \u2212 \u03b1)kr\u22121 ln k is an integer. By\n(2) \u03b1 exists. We must show that with probability greater than 2/3, every subset of t vertices is\nnot a dominating set. Fix X \u2282 V (G) with |X| = t. For v \u2208 V (G) \\ X, the probability that\nv is not adjacent to any vertex of X is precisely (1 \u2212 p)t . Thus, v is dominated by X with\nprobability 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 p)t . Since the edges of G are chosen independently, the probability that |X| is\n\u0001\na dominating set is precisely (1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 p)t )n\u2212t . As there are nt choices for X it suffices to show\n\u0001\nthat nt (1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 p)t )n\u2212t < 1/3.

Trivially, if a graph G has no element\nof Fg as a subgraph, then all its cycles with lengths g or less are vertex disjoint. Thus, if we can\nprove that the probability that G(n, p) has an element of Fg as a subgraph is less than 1/3, we\nj\n2\nare done. First, notice that |Fg | < 2g * 22g as there are at most 2(2) distinct labeled graphs on j\nvertices. Fix H \u2208 Fg and let h denote the number of vertices of H and m denote the number of\nedges of H. Hence, 4 \u2264 h \u2264 2g \u2212 1 and m \u2265 h + 1. The complete graph on n vertices has less\nthan nh labeled copies of H. For each labeled copy, the probability that it belongs to G(n, p) is\nh\nprecisely pm (1 \u2212 p)( 2)\u2212m \u2264 pm .
