With the correct power counting it\ncan be applied to systems with large scattering length a\nand is an expansion in R/a, where R denotes the range\nof the underlying interaction.\nWhen applied to the three-body system with large scattering length, a three-body force [2] \u2013 or equivalently one\nsubtraction \u2013 is needed to obtain cutoff independent results at leading order (LO). Although this fact seems to\nlimit the predictive power of the EFT, it has been very\nsuccessful in describing various atomic and nuclear lowenergy observables and has been used as a tool to understand universal properties of few-body systems with\nlarge scattering length [3, 4, 5].\nTo achieve high precision in three-body calculations\nhigher order corrections have to be included. It is clear\nhow to do this for the two-body system, however, in the\nthree-body system it is not a priori obvious at which\norder an additional three-body counterterm has to be included. While Hammer and Mehen [6] showed that no\nadditional three-body datum is needed for renormalization at next-to-leading order (NLO) and later works have\ncome to the same conclusion, different conclusion have\nbeen reached for different renormalization methods at\nnext-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO). While Bedaque et\nal. [7] and Barford and Birse [8] found that an additional\nenergy-dependent three-body counterterm is needed for\nrenormalization if an explicit three-body force is used and\nthe cutoff \u039b is kept at \u223c 1/R , we showed recently [9]\nthat within a subtraction formalism previously developed\n[10, 11], no additional three-body counterterm has to be\nintroduced at NLO and NNLO for a consistent renormalization of observables if \u039b \u226b 1/R. In this work, we computed also effective range corrections for the 4 He trimer\nsystem up to NNLO and achieved very good agreement\nwith a previous calculation using a realistic atom-atom\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: lplatter@phy.ohiou.edu\n\npotential. We showed that observables are cutoff independent for sufficiently large cutoffs and that effective\nrange corrections to observables scale as expected. In\nthis paper we will extend this work to the three-nucleon\nsystem and discuss the corresponding results. As the\npower counting in the neutron-deuteron quartet channel\nis well understood [12], we will focus here on the neutrondeuteron doublet channel.\nIn the following we will explain briefly the subtraction\nscheme which is used in this work to renormalize threebody observables, give results for the triton binding energy and scattering phaseshifts and discuss corrections up\nto NNLO to a universal correlation between the nucleondeuteron scattering length and the triton binding energy,\nknown as the Phillips line. We will end this paper with\na short conclusion and an outlook.\n\nII.\n\nTHEORY\n\nAt sufficiently low energies few-body systems interacting through short-range interactions can be described\nwith an EFT built up from contact interactions alone.\nEmploying an auxiliary field formalism [2] the neutrondeuteron system in the singlet channel can be described\nby the Lagrangian [5]\nL = N \u2020 (i\u22020 +\n\n\u22072\n\u22072\n)N \u2212 t\u2020i (\u22020 +\n\u2212 \u2206t )ti\n2M\n4M\n\u22072\n\u2212 \u2206s )sj\n\u2212s\u2020j (\u22020 +\n4M\n\u0012\n\n\u2212G3 N \u2020 gt2 (ti \u03c3i )\u2020 ti\u2032 \u03c3i\u2032\n\n1\n+ gt gs [(ti \u03c3i )\u2020 sj \u03c4j + h.c]\n3\n\u0013\n+gs2 (sj \u03c4j )\u2020 sj \u2032 \u03c4j \u2032\n\n+ ... ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere N represents the nucleon field and ti (sj ) are the\ndinucleon fields for the 3 S1 (1 S0 ) channels with the corresponding quantum numbers, respectively. The dots indicate more terms with more fields/derivatives.\nThe full two-body propagator \u03c4 is the result of dressing\n\n\f2\nthe bare dinucleon propagator by nucleon loops to all\norders\n\u03c4\u03b1 (E) = \u2212\n\n2\n1\n\u221a\n\u03c0m \u2212\u03b3\u03b1 + \u2212mE +\n\nr\u03b1\n2\n\n(\u03b3\u03b12 + mE)\n\n,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere the index \u03b1 = s, t indicates either the singlet or\ntiplet two-nucleon scattering channel.

Bedaque et al. [7]\ncalculated higher order corrections up to NNLO introducing an additional energy-dependent three-body force\nat this order. In this section we will demonstrate by\nexplicit calculation that no additional three-body force\nis needed for renormalization and considerable improvement in results is achieved at NNLO. We have computed\nthe triton binding energy at LO, NLO and NNLO using the neutron-deuteron scattering length as the threebody input parameter [13]. Our results are displayed\nin table I. When using the experimental value for the\nneutron-deuteron singlet scattering length a3 = 0.645 fm\nas three-body input we obtain a triton binding energy of\n\n-0.5\n\n-1\n\nk cot \u03b4 (fm )\n\n0\n\n-1\n\n-1.5\n0\n\n0.02\n\n0.04\n2\n-2\nk (fm )\n\n0.06\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) Phase shifts for neutron-deuteron scattering below the deuteron breakup at LO (dashed-dotted\nline), NLO (dashed line) and NNLO (solid line).

The second column indicates which parameters\nwere used at what order of the calculation. Energies and\nlengths are given in MeV and fm, respectively.\n\nB3 = 8.48 MeV at NNLO which has to be compared to\nthe experimental value B3Exp = 8.54 MeV. The results\nshow a significant improvement with each order and are\nsufficiently close at NNLO to the experimental value to\nagree with a projected error at this order of approximately (rt \u03b3t )3 \u223c 3%. At these orders the error caused\nby the uncertainty in the effective range parameters is\nsmaller than the error caused by N3 LO corrections.\nUsing the set of integral equations in Eq.(5) with the expanded two-body propagator in Eq.(3) leads at LO, NLO\nand NNLO to the phaseshifts shown in Fig.1. For comparison we show in the same figure the results of a forty\nyear old phaseshift analysis [14] and a theoretical calculation using a realistic nucleon-nucleon potential [15]. At\nhigher order our results seem to describe the experimental data better but considering the age of the analysis\nand the fact that no errors are given for these data, the\ntheoretical calculation by Kievsky et al. should be considered as the true benchmark test for our calculation.\nAt NLO our results already lie significantly closer to this\ncalculation and nearly perfect agreement is achieved at\nNNLO. It should be noted that our results at LO and\nNLO order agree with previous EFT calculations results\ngiven in [6, 7, 11]. We also achieve qualitative agreement\nat NNLO with Ref.[7], however, without employing an\nadditional three-body counterterm.\nA further way to illustrate the improvement in our results is to consider the Phillips line. The Phillips line\nis a universal feature of three-body systems with a large\ntwo-body scattering length and arises as a nearly linear\ncorrelation between the 1+2 scattering length and the\nthree-body binding energy. In Fig.2 we display our results for LO, NLO and NNLO and display also the experimental value. It is interesting to note that in contradistinction to the 4 He trimer system the Phillips line has\nnot converged to a definite result yet [9]. The obvious\nreason for this is the rather large expansion coefficient\nwhich is roughly \u03b3t rt \u223c 1/3 while \u03b3r \u223c 0.1 in the 4 He\nsystem. The power counting derived in [9] is valid for\ncutoffs much larger than 1/r. Therefore, our results have\nbeen evaluated at corresponding cutoffs and in fact our\nresults are fully converged with respect to \u039b. The results given in this section are also numerically converged\nup to the digits displayed. Further, we also analyzed\n\n\f4\n3\n\na3[fm]\n\n2\n1\n0\n-1\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\nB3[MeV]\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\nFIG. 2: (Color online) The Phillips line for leading (dotdashed line), next-to-leading (dashed line) and next-to-nextto-leading (solid line) order. The cross denotes the experimental value.\n\nthe convergence of three-body observables when using a\ndifferent parametrisation for higher order two-body corrections called Z-matching [16, 17] and have found the\nsame results up to the level of accuracy expected in an\nNNLO calculation.\nIV.\n\nresults for the binding energies and scattering phaseshifts\nsimultaneously. Our value for the triton binding energy\nagrees very well with the experimental value and the results for the neutron-deuteron phaseshifts seem to be\nin nearly perfect agreement with a calculation using a\nrealistic nucleon-nucleon potential. The results for the\nscattering phaseshifts agree qualitatively with previous\ncalculations at NLO [6, 11] and NNLO [7], although a\nsecond three-body counterterm was included in [7]. In\nparticular, these results seem to agree very well with an\nexpected error of (\u03b3r)3 \u223c 3% for an NNLO calculation.\nWe have therefore presented further numerical evidence\nwhich supports the claim in Ref. [9] that calculations can\nbe performed with exactly on three-body counterterm up\nto NNLO in the EFT with contact interactions alone.\nOur analysis presented in [9] indicates that at N3 LO an\nadditional three-body input is needed for renormalization\nof observables. Therefore, NNLO can be also considered\nas the last order at which a prediction can be made for\nthe Phillips line as it is a correlation gouverned by one\nthree-body parameter.\nFurther possible applications of the subtraction formalism include the calculation of scattering observables\nabove the breakup threshold and the coupling of external currents to the three-nucleon system, including the\nelectromagnetic form factor beyond leading order [18].\n\nSUMMARY\n\nIn this paper we have computed three-nucleon observables with the EFT with contact interactions alone up\nto NNLO using a subtraction scheme for renormalization. We have shown that the results for observables\nimprove significantly at NNLO without performing an\nadditional subtraction, i,e. without the introduction of a\nfurther energy dependent three-body counterterm. This\nimprovement is in particular obvious if one considers the\n\n[1] S. R. Beane, P. F. Bedaque, W. C. Haxton, D. R. Phillips,\nand M. J.
