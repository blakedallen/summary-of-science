In the compactified space a string does not distinguish\nwhether it propagates on a spacetime with a circular dimension of radius R\n\u2032\nor \u03b1R , a property discussed already more than 20 years ago [1, 2]. The investigations during the last decade show that string theory should possess an\nextremely rich symmetry of this type, including the relations among various\ndimensional D-branes.\nAt present, there are many approaches throughout in the literature, discussing T-duality in various contexts and developed rather independently:\nAn early formulation of the T-duality was given in [3]. Then, discussions\nfrom the world sheet point of view of string theory and the investigation of\nstring states, including the boundary states, followed [4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. The Tduality was also formulated at the level of the low energy effective theory. In\nthe closed string sector the transformation rules in the supergravity, known\nas the Buscher rules, were formulated in [9] and were further investigated\nin [10, 11, 12, 13]. More recently, the T-duality with nontrivial H-flux was\ninvestigated by taking the global structure of spacetime into account, see e.g.\n[14]. To include the open string sector, the T-duality has to be extended to a\nformulation including D-branes. Under T-duality, the effective theory of the\nD-branes relates the theories in various dimensions, and the effect of the Tduality on the Chern-Simons term [10, 15, 16, 17], and on matrix models [18]\nwere discussed. It was also recognized [13] that a certain gauge theory duality, i.e. a Nahm transformation [19, 20], relates to the T-duality of the bound\nstates of the branes, with subsequent arguments [21, 22]. On the other hand,\nin order to make contact with phenomenology, compactification scenarios for\nthe extra dimensions into rather complicated backgrounds such as CalabiYau spaces [23] or certain generalized spaces are considered. Generalizations\nof the Riemann geometry are proposed and a fiberwise T-duality of bundles\nor sheaves are discussed. In these pictures, the D-branes are described by\ncoherent sheaves, and the T-duality transformations are considered to be\nFourier-Mukai transforms along certain fibers (see e.g. [24]).\nOur aim here is to analyze the compatibility among the results on Tduality found in the various approaches, i.e. worldsheet, supergravity and\ngauge theory, discussed above. The boundary state description of D-branes is\nan appropriate framework for such a purpose, since a boundary state can be\ndefined for D-branes with a non-trivial gauge bundle on it, and its coupling\n1\n\n\fto various closed string states is also easily estimated. This became possible\ndue to the recent progress achieved in constructing the boundary state with\nnontrivial gauge bundle on a compact worldvolume ([25, 26] and references\ntherein). We treat here the 2-dimensional torus using the boundary state\nformulation of a D2/D0-brane system and examine its compatibility with\nthe corresponding Nahm-Fourier-Mukai duality.\nThe Nahm transformation was originally proposed for the case of a 4dimensional gauge theory with the aim to construct the monopole solution\n[19] and instanton solution [20]. The case of the instanton solution on the\n4-dimensional torus is well understood: The Nahm transformation gives a\nmap from the k instanton solution of a SU(N) gauge theory on a torus T 4\nto the N instanton solution of the SU(k) gauge theory on its dual 4-torus\nT\u0303 4 [27, 28].\nThe role of the Nahm transformation in the string theory becomes transparent with the observation, along the line of [29, 30], that at low energies\nthe theory of N D4-branes wrapping a 4-dimensional torus T 4 corresponds to\na U(N) gauge theory on a bunch of N D4-branes including k D0 branes and\ncorresponds to a k-instanton solution in this gauge theory. The T-dual map\nT 4 \u2192 T\u0303 4 transforms this ND4/kD0 brane system into a system of kD4/ND0\nbranes. The compatibility of T-duality and the Nahm transformation in this\ncase was observed in [13] by using the probe analysis.\nSince the case of dimension 4 is rather special, we want to check this\nsituation for tori of dimensions other than 4k. The Nahm transformation\nof T 2 case has been previously considered in [21], however, important sign\nfactors needed for consistency were missing there. As a result the compatibility with T-duality could not be justified. In this paper, we first describe\nthe 2-dimensional Nahm transformation in detail, by following [21] mainly,\nbut correcting some formulae. Unlike to the T 4 case where an anti-selfdual\n(ASD) gauge field is transformed into an ASD gauge field on the dual torus,\nin the 2-dimensional case the Nahm transformation maps a uniform magnetic\nflux F\u03bc\u03bd of T 2 into that of the dual 2-torus F\u0303\u03bc\u03bd . These states correspond to\nthe BPS bound states of D2-branes and D0-branes, where D0-branes are\ndissolved inside D2-branes as a uniform flux.\nSince the gauge field configuration is rather simple, we can explicitly construct the corresponding boundary states and compare the T-duality and the\nNahm transformation directly on the string level. For the bosonic string sector, we will use the formulation of boundary states with a constant magnetic\nflux constructed in [25, 26]. As shown in [25], even this simple case, T-duality\n2\n\n\ftransformation is accompanied by an appropriate cocycle factor. Including\nsuch a cocycle factor, we will establish the precise agreement of the T-duality\ntransformation of the boundary state with the Nahm transformation in the\nbosonic string theory.\nThis result at first sight seems odd because the minus sign in the dual\nmagnetic flux suggests an anti-D0-brane rather than a D0-brane. In order\nto estimate the correct RR-charges carried by the dual boundary state, we\nhave to extend the boundary states to the fermionic part. Therefore, we\nconstruct the boundary state in the superstring theory. For this end, we will\ngive a new representation of the RR-zeromodes. It gives the same amplitude\nas the standard representation after the GSO projection, but as we will see,\nit is suitable when considering the T-duality transformation. In this setup,\nit is easy to show the invariance of the RR-coupling of the boundary state,\nnamely, the Nahm transformation gives the desired RR-charges in the dual\ntheory. We will also derive the T-duality rule for RR-potentials, known as\nBuscher rule or Hori formula, and show the invariance of the Chern-Simons\nterm in terms of low energy fields. We emphasize that the overall signs\nappearing in these formulae are automatically implied by the string theory\nT-duality and are important to maintain the invariance.\nThe plan of this paper is as follows. In section 2, we will describe the\nNahm transformation in detail. In section 3, a brief review of the construction of boundary states on the torus following [25, 26] is given and the explicit form for our gauge configuration is derived. Then we perform the Tduality transformation of this boundary state. In section 4, we construct the\nfermionic part of the boundary state using a representation which simplifies\nthe pairing with the RR-state, and compare the T-duality and Nahm transformation. Then the coupling to RR-potentials are investigated. Section 5\ngives conclusions and discussion.\n\n2\n\nNahm transformation on the 2-dimensional\ntorus\n\nWe consider U(N) bundle E over the 2-dimensional torus T 2 with bundle\nconnection denoted by A\u03bc . To define the Nahm transformation which maps\nthe U(N) bundle E over a torus T 2 to its dual one \u1ebc over T\u0303 2 , we introduce the\nPoincar\u00e9 bundle P \u2192 T 2 \u00d7 T\u0303 2 , which is a complex line bundle with curvature\n3\n\n\f1\ndx\u03bc \u2227dx\u0303\u03bc ,\n2\u03c0\n\nwhere x\u03bc and x\u0303\u03bc are coordinates on T 2 , T\u0303 2 respectively. We also\ndefine the projection \u03c0 : T 2 \u00d7 T\u0303 2 \u2192 T 2 , (and correspondingly for the dual\ntorus).\nRoughly speaking, the Nahm transform of E is defined by the following\nprocess: take the pull-back to T 2 \u00d7 T\u0303 2 , tensor with the Poincar\u00e9 bundle P,\nand then project to define a bundle \u1ebc on T\u0303 2 as the index bundle of the Dirac\noperator, as we will now describe. Considering the bundle E = \u03c0 \u2217 E \u2297 P\nover T 2 \u00d7 T\u0303 2 , we can obtain a family of covariant derivatives Dx\u0303 \u03bc (x) =\n\u2202\u03bc \u2212 iA\u03bc (x) \u2212 i x\u03032\u03c0\u03bc by restricting the bundle to Ex\u0303 = \u03c0 \u2217 E \u2297 P|T 2 \u00d7{x\u0303} . The\ncovariant derivative is then parametrized by x\u0303. Given a Dirac operator, which\nmaps a section of the spin bundle S \u00b1 coupled to E on T 2 to the opposite\nchirality:\nD \u00b1 : \u0393(T 2 , S \u2213 \u2297 E) \u2192 \u0393(T 2 , S \u00b1 \u2297 E) ,\n(2.1)\nthe corresponding Dirac operator coupled with E is decomposed into Dx\u0303+ , Dx\u0303\u2212\nas\nD\n/ x\u0303 = \u03b3 \u03bc Dx\u0303 \u03bc\n\u0012\n\u0013\n0 Dx\u0303+\n=\n,\nDx\u0303\u2212 0\n\n(2.2)\n\nwhere \u03b3\u03bc = \u2212i\u03c3\u03bc with the Pauli matrices \u03c3\u03bc , \u03bc = 1, 2, and\nx\u03032\nx\u03031\n) \u2212 (\u22022 \u2212 iA2 \u2212 i ) ,\n2\u03c0\n2\u03c0\nx\u03032\nx\u0303\n1\nDx\u0303\u2212 = \u2212i(\u22021 \u2212 iA1 \u2212 i ) + (\u22022 \u2212 iA2 \u2212 i ) .\n2\u03c0\n2\u03c0\n\nDx\u0303+ = \u2212i(\u22021 \u2212 iA1 \u2212 i\n\n(2.3)\n\nFrom now on we consider a bundle E with a positive first Chern number,\nC1 (E) = k > 0 and we look for the Dirac zero modes. In this case, the\nequation Dx\u0303\u2212 \u03c8 = 0 has no normalized solutions for the left-handed component\n\u03c8 \u2208 \u0393(T 2 , \u03c0 \u2217 S + \u2297 Ex\u0303 ), it follows from the index theorem that for the righthanded spinor \u03c8 \u2208 \u0393(T 2 , \u03c0 \u2217 S \u2212 \u2297 Ex\u0303 ),\nDx\u0303+ \u03c8 = 0\n\n(2.4)\n\nhas k normalized solutions \u03c8 p (p = 1, * * * , k), that depend on the parameter\nx\u0303.

This formula holds for Dirac operators\n5\n\n\fDx\u0303+ : \u0393(S + ) \u2192 \u0393(S \u2212 ) of any even dimensional spin manifold M coupled\nto any connection carried by a bundle E over M \u00d7 Y . For our case, M\ncorresponds to T 2 , E = \u03c0 \u2217 E \u2297 P and the space Y is the dual torus, so that\n\u00c2(T 2 ) = 1. Note that the bundle ind(Dx\u0303 , E) on the l.h.s. is nothing but the\nbundle \u1ebc over the dual torus T\u0303 2 . Then eq. (2.9) boils down to the expression\n[13]\nZ\nch(\u1ebc) =\nch(P) \u2227 ch(E) ,\n(2.10)\nT2\n\nwith the Chern characters being defined as\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0012 \u0013\nF\nP\nch(E) = Tr exp\n, ch(P) = exp\n.\n2\u03c0\n2\u03c0\n\n(2.11)\n\nHere F is the curvature of thePgauge field A and P is the curvature of the\n1\nPoincar\u00e9 bundle given by P = \u03bc 2\u03c0\ndx\u03bc \u2227dx\u0303\u03bc . We have set the length of each\nedge of the torus and of the dual torus to 2\u03c0Ri and 2\u03c0 R\u0303i , respectively, such\nthat(vol T 2 ) * (vol T\u0303 2 ) = (2\u03c0)4 . Thus, the index theorem relates the curvature\non the bundle E with bundle connection parametrized by the coordinate x\u0303\nof the dual torus to the bundle \u1ebc over the dual torus.\nExpanding (2.10), we obtain (by considering both sides separately)\n(L.H.S.) = rank(\u1ebc) + c1 (\u1ebc),\ndx\u03031 \u2227 dx\u03032\n,\n(2.12)\nvol(T\u0303 2 )\nR\nwhere c1 (E) is the first Chern class and C1 (E) = c1 (E) is the Chern number. From these relations we get\n(R.H.S.) = C1 (E) \u2212 rank(E)\n\nrank(\u1ebc) = C1 (E) ,\nC1 (\u1ebc) = \u2212rank(E) .\n\n(2.13)\n\nThus, the index theorem tells us that the Nahm transformation exchanges the\nrank of the gauge group and first Chern number up to a sign. Symbolically,\nit gives a map of gauge fields of (N, k) \u2192 (k, \u2212N).\nThe minus sign in \u2212N simply reflects the direction of the magnetic field\non the dual torus. From the point of view of the D-brane picture, however, it\nseems naively the appearance of N anti-D0-branes instead of N D0-branes\n6\n\n\fin the T-dual theory. This discrepancy motivates us to study the consistency\nwith T-duality, which transforms ND2/kD0-branes into kD2/ND0-branes5 .\nTo compare with the T-duality in string theory below, we need an explicit\nprofile for the U(N) gauge field A of the constant curvature and its Nahm\ntransform. For this end it is convenient to adopt a twisted bundle construction, originally considered by 't Hooft [32] and widely used in matrix models\n(see for example [18]). Define the torus as the covering space R2 quotient by\nthe action of a period lattice \u039b = {(2\u03c0R1 n, 2\u03c0R2 m)|n, m \u2208 Z2 }, and decompose U(N) = (U(1) \u00d7 SU(N))/ZN . Then, the gauge field A must obey the\nboundary condition\nA\u03bc (x1 + 2\u03c0R1 , x2 ) = \u03a91 (x2 )(i\u2202\u03bc + A\u03bc )(x1 , x2 )\u03a9\u22121\n1 (x2 ) ,\n\u22121\nA\u03bc (x1 , x2 + 2\u03c0R2 ) = \u03a92 (x1 )(i\u2202\u03bc + A\u03bc )(x1 , x2 )\u03a92 (x1 ) ,\n\n(2.14)\n\nwhere \u03a9\u03bc , \u03bc = 1, 2 are U(N)-transition functions satisfying the cocycle condition\n\u22121\n\u03a91 (2\u03c0R2 )\u03a92 (0)\u03a9\u22121\n1 (0)\u03a92 (2\u03c0R1 ) = 1 .\n\n(2.15)\n\nThe transition functions for the configuration with Chern number k can be\nchosen as\n\u03a91 = eikx2 /N R2 U k ,\n\n\u03a92 = V ,\n\nU k V = e\u22122\u03c0ik/N V U k ,\n\nwhere the SU(N) matrices U and V are\n\uf8eb\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n1\n0 1\n2\u03c0i\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n.\nN\n..\ne\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec ..\n\uf8f7\n.\nU =\uf8ec\n,\nV\n=\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n..\n.\n\uf8ed\n\uf8ed 0\n\uf8f8\n1\n2\u03c0i(N\u22121)\n1\n0\n*\n*\n*\n0\ne N\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7.\n\uf8f8\n\n(2.16)\n\n(2.17)\n\nWith this choice of transition functions, (2.14) is satisfied by the following\ngauge field configuration\nA1 = 0 , A2 =\n5\n\nk\nx1 ,\nN2\u03c0R1 R2\n\n(2.18)\n\nIn the case of an negative Chern number, C1 (E) = \u2212k (k > 0), there are k-zeromodes\nin the left-handed spinor, and accordingly, the index theorem (2.10) is modified by multiplying the minus sign in the right hand side, so that we have a map (N, \u2212k) \u2192 (k, N ).\nThus, the rank of the dual gauge group is always kept positive. Of course, there is the\nsame problem in the D-brane interpretation of the relative sign.\n\n7\n\n\fand the field strength is non-vanishing in the U(1) part only, to give the\ndesired Chern number:\nZ\nk\n1\nF12 =\nTrF = k .\n(2.19)\n, C1 =\nN2\u03c0R1 R2\n2\u03c0 T 2\nUnlike the 4 dimensional case, the gauge field A\u03bc has no moduli and hence\nis unique up to U(N) gauge transformations.\nWith this gauge profile, we now follow the procedure of the Nahm transformation. The (right-handed) spinors \u03c8 in the U(N) fundamental representation should obey the boundary conditions\n\u03c8(x1 + 2\u03c0R1 , x2 ) = \u03a91 (x2 )\u03c8(x1 , x2 ) ,\n\u03c8(x1 , x2 + 2\u03c0R2 ) = \u03a92 (x1 )\u03c8(x1 , x2 ) ,\n\n(2.20)\n\nand the general solution of these conditions is given by [18].\n\u03c8(x1 , x2 ) =\n\n\u0015\n\u0014\nx1 k\nY \u03c6p (Y ) ,\nexp i\nR\nN\n1\np=1\n\nk\nXX\ns\u2208Z\n\n(2.21)\n\nx2\nwhere Y \u2261 2\u03c0R\n+ u + Ns + Nk p, and \u03c6p (p = 1, * * * , k) is an arbitrary function\n2\nof Y . Here u = 1, * * * , N labels each component of SU(N) fundamental representation. By substituting (2.21) into the Dirac equation (2.4), it reduces\nto equations for \u03c6p .

For generic f p , we get k normalized zeromodes \u03be p (p = 1, * * * , k), whose component \u03beup is given by\n\"\n\u001a\n\u001b2 #\nX\nNR\nk\n\u03c0kR\n1\n2\nY \u2212\n\u03beup (x, x\u0303) = N\nexp ix1\nY + R2 ix\u03032 Y \u2212\nx\u03031\n,\nNR\nNR\n2\u03c0k\n1\n1\ns\u2208Z\n(2.24)\n8\n\n\fwhere N =\n\n\u0010\n\nk\n8\u03c0 4 N R31 R2\n\n\u0011 14\n\nP R\n\nis the normalization constant to satisfy the or-\n\nthonormal condition u d2 x\u03beup\u2020\u03beuq = \u03b4 pq . The general solution for the Dirac\nzero modes \u03c8 p is a linear combination of these of the form\nX\n\u03c8 p (x, x\u0303) =\n\u03be q (x, x\u0303)g qp (x\u0303) ,\n(2.25)\nq\n\nwhere g is a U(k)-valued function on T\u0303 2 , which originates from f p above.\nSubstituting this result into formula (2.8), we obtain the U(k) gauge fields\nas k \u00d7 k hermitian matrix valued fields as\n\u00c31 = \u2212(g \u2020 \u2202 \u03031 g)(x\u03031 , x\u03032 ) ,\nNR1 R2\n\u00c32 = \u2212\nx\u03031 1k \u2212 (g \u2020\u2202 \u03032 g)(x\u03031 , x\u03032 ).\n2\u03c0k\n\n(2.26)\n\nBy using the U(k) gauge freedom we can put g(x\u03031 , x\u03032 ) = 1.

(2.27)\n\nFrom this we can read off the transition functions as\n\u03a9\u03031 = e\u2212iN x\u03032 /kR\u03032 \u0168 N ,\n\n\u03a9\u03032 = \u1e7c ,\n\n(2.28)\n\nwhere \u0168 and \u1e7c are SU(k) matrices similar to (2.17). This is the configuration\nof a gauge group U(k) with first Chern number equal to \u2212N, in accordance\nwith the Atiyah-Singer family index theorem. We have also shown the correspondence of two moduli spaces of constant curvature connections on the\ntorus and the dual torus.\nWe close this section with a historical remark. To our knowledge, [21]\nis the first paper that teated the 2-dimensional version of the Nahm transformation concretely. Our presentation here follow closely that paper, but\nwe correct their intermediate calculations, leading to the important sign in\nC\u03031 = \u2212N.\n\n3\n\nThe boundary state on the torus T 2\n\nIn this section we consider boundary states of D2/D0 bound states on the\ntorus and investigate the compatibility between T-duality and the Nahm\n9\n\n\ftransformation. We first follow the construction of the boundary state of\nbosonic strings developed in [25, 26], and take its T-dual. It turns out that\nthey are consistent in the bosonic string sector. However, this raises a puzzle\nfor the interpretation of the result from the D-brane point of view. We thus\ngeneralize the argument to superstring theory by focusing on the RR-sector.\nTo this end, we give a novel representation of the RR zeromodes, that is\nsuitable to deal with T-duality. We will show the invariance of the ChernSimons term for the bound state and resolve the puzzle at the end of this\nsection.\nOur parametrization\nhere is such that the two edges of the torus have\n\u221a\n\u2032\nlengths 2\u03c0 \u03b1 . Then the information of the shape of the torus which appeared in the previously discussed Nahm transformation is now absorbed\ninto the metric.\n\n3.1\n\nConstruction of the boundary state\n\nIt is known that in Minkowski space, the boundary state |Bi for a single\nDp-brane is given by a sum of eigenstates for all loops on the worldvolume\n[33]. A boundary state describing a system of Dq-branes inside Dp-branes\nis constructed by operating an appropriate Wilson loop factor OA , carrying\nthe information on the Dq-branes as a non-trivial gauge connection, on the\nboundary state of a single Dp-brane. In [25, 26], this construction is generalized to the case of a toroidal target space T 2d and a non-trivial gauge bundle\nwrapping a torus, called a magnetized D(2d)-brane. Note that a string loop\naround a cycle of the torus is described by an open path in the corresponding covering space. In such a case, a naive Wilson line factor is not gauge\ninvariant. To obtain a gauge invariant loop factor OA , transition functions\nof the gauge bundle have to be inserted along this path in the covering space\n[25, 26].\nMore specifically, the boundary state in the direction of a magnetized\nD2-brane wrapping N times a torus T 2 is given by\n|BF i = OA |Bi\n\u221e\nE\nX Y\np\n\u2020\n1 \u2020\n= OA det(G + B)\ne\u2212 n \u03b1n GR\u03b1\u0303n ~0; m\n~ ,\n2\nm\u2208Z\n~\n\n(3.1)\n\nn=1\n\nHere |Bi is the standard Neumann boundary state on T 2d , where |~n; mi\n~\n2\ndenotes a state for zeromodes with the Kaluza-Klein momentum ~n \u2208 Z and\n10\n\n\fthe winding numbers m\n~ \u2208 Z2 along T 2 . G\u03b1\u03b2 and B\u03b1\u03b2 are the metric and the\n2\nB-field on T , respectively, and their combination R = (G + B)\u22121 (G \u2212 B)\nindicates the boundary condition ((G + B)\u03b1n + (G \u2212 B)\u03b1\u0303\u2212n )|Bi = 0. Next,\nthe Wilson loop factor OA is given by [25]\n\u03b1\n\nOA = TrN\n\n\u22121\nY mY\n\n\u03b1=1,2 l=0\n\n\u03b1\u22121\n\u221a X\n\u221a\n\u2032\n\u03a9\u03b1 (x + 2\u03c0 \u03b1\nm\u03b2 a\u03b2 + 2\u03c0 \u03b1\u2032 la\u03b1 ) exp(\u2212SA ). (3.2)\n\u03b2=1\n\nwhere the exponential factor is a naive path-ordered Wilson loop operator\nspecified by a U(N) gauge configuration\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ 2\u03c0\ni\n\u03b1\nexp(\u2212SA ) = P exp\nA\u03b1 \u2202\u03c3 X d\u03c3 ,\n(3.3)\n2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032 0\nand \u03a9\u03b1 (x) is a transition function of the gauge bundle. In the above, X \u03b1 (\u03c3)\n(string variable), x\u03b1 (center of mass coordinate) and m\u03b1 (winding) are operators acting on the closed string Hilbert space. To understand the expression,\nlet us act OA on a eigenstate \u221a\nof X(\u03c3),\nis seen as a path in the covering\nP2 which\n\u03b1\n2\n\u2032\nspace R starting from x+2\u03c0 \u03b1 \u03b1=1 m a\u03b1 (m\u03b1 \u2208 Z) and ending in x, with\na\u03b1 being the \u03b1-th cycle of the torus T 2 . Whenever the path passes across the\nboundary of a cell, a transition function must be introduced to glue the fields.\nThe above factors correctly take this effect into account to maintain the Wilson loop factor gauge invariant. Because the Neumann boundary state is a\nsum over all loops, eigenvalues x\u03b1 and m\u03b1 are replaced with corresponding\noperators. An equivalent and more direct definition is also given in [26].\nThe significance of this construction is already seen in the case of ND2branes with vanishing gauge field A\u03b1 = 0. Consider a D2-brane wrapped N\ntimes around the cycle a2 along x2 -direction. In this case, transition functions\ncan be chosen as \u03a91 = 1, \u03a92 = V , and the Wilson loop factor\nOA=0 = TrN (V m2 )\n\n(3.4)\n\nconstrains possible winding numbers along x2 to m2 = Ns2 (s2 \u2208 Z) integer\nmultiples of the wrapping number N. Then, the corresponding boundary\nstate is obtained as\n\u0012\n\u0013\u001d\n\u221e\nXY\np\n1 \u2020\ns1\n\u2212n\n\u03b1n GR\u03b1\u0303\u2020n\n|BA=0 i = N det(G + B)\ne\n0;\n. (3.5)\nNs2\n2\n~\ns\u2208Z n=1\n\n11\n\n\fSince the D2-brane is wrapped N times along x2 -direction, closed strings\nemitted from it carry winding numbers along this direction with integer\nmultiples of N. Suppose now, a D2-brane wrapped N\u03b1 times along the\n\u03b1-th cycle of the torus with N = N1 N2 . Then, the transition functions are\n\u03a91 = VN1 \u00d7N1 \u2297 1N2 \u00d7N2 and \u03a91 = 1N1 \u00d7N1 \u2297 VN2 \u00d7N2 , and thus by acting\nm2\n1\nOA=0 = TrN (\u03a9m\n1 \u03a92 ),\n\n(3.6)\n\nwe obtain\n|BA=0 i = N\n\np\n\ndet(G + B)\n\n\u221e\nXY\n\n1 \u2020\n\u2212n\n\u03b1n GR\u03b1\u0303\u2020n\n\ne\n\n~s\u2208Z2 n=1\n\n0;\n\n\u0012\n\nN1 s1\nN2 s2\n\n\u0013\u001d\n\n. (3.7)\n\nThese examples shows the importance of transition functions to determine\nthe zeromode structure in the boundary state.\n\n3.2\n\nT-duality transformation - bosonic sector\n\nLet us construct the boundary state on T 2 corresponding to the situation\nof the Nahm transformation in the previous section. The ND2/kD0 bound\nstate is regarded as a D2-brane wrapped N times on T 2 , with a gauge bundle\nwith first Chern number k on it. Here, we only consider the case where N\nand k are coprime. This is specified by the U(N) gauge configuration (2.18)\nA1 = 0 , A2 =\n\nk\nx1 ,\n2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032N\n\nF12 =\n\nk\n,\n2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032 N\n\nC1 = k,\n\n(3.8)\n\nas well as the transition functions (2.16)\n\u03a91 = eikx2 /N\n\n\u221a\n\n\u03b1\u2032\n\nUk ,\n\n\u03a92 = V .\n\n(3.9)\n\nNote that the convention is slightly changed, with the data about the shape\nof the torus being encoded in the parameters\nai of the metric, which give the\n\u221a\n\u2032\nlength of the i-cycle in the unit of \u03b1 . Thus we take flat background as\n\u0013\n\u0012 2\nRi\na1 0\n, ai = \u221a\nG=\n(3.10)\n2\n0 a2\n\u03b1\u2032\nand B = 0.\n\n12\n\n\fThe boundary state for this kind of situations is already computed in\n[25, 26], so that we just quote the result. It is equivalent to replace B in the\nNeumann boundary state with 2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032F :\nX\np\n1\n\u2032\n2\n|BF i = N det(G + 2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032 F )\ne\u2212i\u03c0m (2\u03c0\u03b1 F12 )m\n\u00d7\n\n\u221e\nY\n\nn=1\n\n~\ns\u2208Z2\n\n1\n\n\u2020\n\n\u2020\n\ne\u2212 n \u03b1n GR\u03b1\u0303n |\u2212(2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032 F )N~s, N~s i ,\n\n(3.11)\n\nwhere R = (G + 2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032 F )\u22121(G \u2212 2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032 F ) represents the mixed boundary condition. Note that all F 's in this expression belong to the U(1) part of\nthe U(N) field strength. The zeromode part in components is (n1 , n2 ) =\n(\u22122\u03c0\u03b1\u2032 F12 Ns2 , 2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032F12 Ns1 ) and (m1 , m2 ) = (Ns1 , Ns2 ), labeled by two integers s1,2 , respectively. This structure of the zeromodes and the extra phase\nfactor in the first line above are the consequence of modifying the Wilson\nloop operator. The result depends, however, only on the metric G, the rank\nN and the U(1) part of the field strength F12 .\nBy substituting the explicit form of G and F into (3.11), we obtain\n\u0013\u001d\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0012\n\u221e\nY\nX\np\n1 \u2020\nNs1\n\u2212ks2\n\u2212i\u03c0N ks1 s2\n\u2212n\n\u03b1n GR\u03b1\u0303\u2020n\n2\n2\n|BF i =\ne\n,\n,\n(a1 a2 N) + k\ne\nNs2\nks1\n2\nn=1\n~\ns\u2208Z\n\u0013\n\u0013\u0012 2 2 2\n\u0012 2\n1\na1 a2 N \u2212 k 2\n\u22122a22 Nk\na1 0\n.\n(3.12)\nGR = 2 2 2\n2a21 Nk\na21 a22 N 2 \u2212 k 2\n0 a22\na1 a2 N + k 2\nThis is the boundary state for ND2/kD0 bound state on T 2 .

The square-root factor is related through h0; 0|BF i to the effective\nDirac-Born-Infeld action, and it is a typical mass formula for the BPS bound\nstate.\nWe now take the T-duality transformation along both directions of T 2 .\nThe radii of the dual torus T\u0303 2 are encoded in the dual metric\n\u0012 2\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\n\u00e31 0\n1/a21\n0\nG\u0303 =\n=\n= G\u22121 ,\n(3.13)\n0 \u00e322\n0\n1/a22\n\nwhich is nothing but the Buscher rule for the case of a diagonal metric G\nand B = 0.

The invariance of the spectrum under\nthe T-duality is written in this notation as H \u223c \u03b1t\u2212n G\u03b1n \u2192 \u03b1t\u2212n G\u0303\u03b1n , i.e., the closed-string\nHamiltonian is written in two different ways.\n\n14\n\n\fBy comparing this with (3.12), we see that the T-duality is the replacement (N, k) \u2192 (k, \u2212N) of two parameters7 , in addition to the change of\nbackground a\u03b1 \u2192 \u00e3\u03b1 . Moreover, the same boundary state (3.18) on the dual\ntorus is obtained by starting from Nahm-transformed gauge configuration\n(2.27), (2.28) with gauge group U(k) and the 1st Chern number \u2212N:\n\u00c31 = 0 ,\n\n\u00c32 = \u2212\n\nN\nx\u03031 ,\n2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032 k\n\n\u03a9\u03031 = e\u2212iN x\u03032 /k\n\n\u221a\n\n\u03b1\u2032\n\nF\u030312 = \u2212\n\u0168 N ,\n\nN\n,\n2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032 k\n\nC\u03031 = \u2212N,\n\n\u03a9\u03032 = \u1e7c ,\n\n(3.19)\n\n(3.20)\n\nwith suitable redefinitions. This is evident by following the same procedure\nleading to (3.12). Therefore, this result shows the consistency between Tduality and the Nahm transformation, importantly including its sign.\nFrom the D-brane point of view, however, this sign seems problematic,\nsince the D0-brane charge naively equals to C1 (\u1ebc) = \u2212N, that suggests N\nanti-D0-branes. To see the correct D0-brane charge, we should work with\nsuperstring theory, and investigate the T-duality rule for RR-potentials to\nbe careful with its sign.\n\n4\n\nFermionic sector and T-duality\n\nSo far we found a complete agreement of the Nahm transformation and the\nT-duality transformation in the bosonic sector of the boundary state. Here,\nwe extend this analysis to the fermionic part of the boundary state: To\nconstruct the fermionic boundary state for ND2/kD0-branes on T 2 and to\nperform the T-duality transformation.\nThe fermionic counterpart of a boundary state (3.1) with and without\ngauge flux has been already formulated in refs. [33, 34, 35, 36]. There, the\npossible effects of transition functions in (3.2) are not taken into account. But\nit turns out that there is no such effect, and their result is still correct. There,\nthe NSNS-oscillators (\u03c8r , \u03c8\u0303r ) (r \u2208 Z + 1/2) and the non-zero RR-oscillators\n(\u03c8n , \u03c8\u0303n ) (n 6= 0) contribute to the boundary state in completely the same way\n7\n\nAnother replacement (N, k) \u2192 (\u2212k, N ) is possible, but is equivalent to the above by\na further renaming of t's. We have chosen (N, k) \u2192 (k, \u2212N ) so as to maintain the rank\nof the dual gauge group to be positive. On the other hand, if C1 (E) = \u2212k, this kind of\nrenaming is the right one. See the remark in the footnote in \u00a72.\n\n15\n\n\fas the bosonic sector, written by the matrix R as in (3.12). The T-duality\ntransformation of this part is also the same as the bosonic case. Therefore,\nthe agreement of the Nahm transformation and the T-duality transformation\nin these parts is clear.\nAccording to the remark above, in this section, we focus on the RRzeromode part of the boundary state. and the coupling of the D-branes to the\nRR antisymmetric fields. We will first give the boundary state for D2/D0branes, by using a novel representation of RR-vacuum, alternative to the\nstandard formulation in [35, 36]. Then we describe its T-duality transformation. After the introduction of the conjugate state in a new representation,\nwe study the RR-coupling of the D-branes. The T-duality invariance of the\nChern-Simons term is shown in a remarkably simple form. In the following,\nthe shape of the torus is less important, so that we simply set the metric G\nas a1 = a2 = 1 (see also the remark below on this point).\n\n4.1\n\nBoundary state for RR zeromodes\n\nWe first describe a new representation for the RR zeromodes briefly. See the\nappendix for more details. Then it is applied to construct D-brane boundary\nstates.\nAs is well-known, the world sheet fermion (\u03c8 \u03bc for left mover and \u03c8\u0303 \u03bc\nfor right mover) in the R-sector has mode expansion labeled by integers,\nand its zeromodes satisfy the 10 dimensional Clifford algebra. Accordingly,\nthe ground states of the left (right) movers are specified by spinor indices\n|Ai(|B\u0303i) of SO(1, 9), respectively, where A, B run 1, * * * , 32. A RR-ground\nstate is a linear combination of tensor products |Ai \u2297 |B\u0303i. In the present\npaper, an explicit gamma matrix representation is taken as\n1\n\u03c80\u03bc |Ai \u2297 |B\u0303i = ( \u221a \u0393\u03bc \u2297 1)|Ai \u2297 |B\u0303i ,\n2\ni\n\u03bc\n\u03c8\u03030 |Ai \u2297 |B\u0303i = (\u039311 \u2297 \u221a \u039311 \u0393\u03bc )|Ai \u2297 |B\u0303i .\n2\n\n(4.1)\n\nNote an extra i\u039311 in the right movers, as compared to the standard representation [35, 36] (see also [37].). This is merely one choice of a representation\nof the SO(1, 9) \u00d7 SO(1, 9) Clifford algebra, but its advantages will become\napparent when we take the GSO projection into account (see also the appendix).\n16\n\n\fDefine an operator \u03b8\u03bc as\n\u221a\n\u03b8\u03bc = (\u03c80\u03bc + i\u03c8\u03030\u03bc )/ 2,\n\n(4.2)\n\nsatisfying the anti-commutation relation\n{\u03b8\u03bc , \u03b8\u03bd\u2020 } = \u03b4\u03bd\u03bc ,\n\n(4.3)\n\nand define the vacuum state |[C]i in the asymmetric picture of left and right\nmovers [38] as\n|[C]i \u2261 ei\u03b20 \u03b3\u03030 |A, \u22121/2iCAB |B\u0303, \u22123/2i ,\n(4.4)\nwhere CAB is the charge conjugation matrix. Here we added the bosonic\nghost sector in the superstring, and \u03b20 , \u03b30 are their zeromodes. We take the\npicture of the left mover as \u2212 21 and of the right mover as \u2212 23 to saturate the\nbackground charge of the \u03b2\u03b3 ghosts. Then, it is easy to show that\n\u03b8\u03bc |[C]i = 0 , \u03b8\u03bc\u2020 |[C]i = |[\u2212C\u0393\u03bc ]i .\n\n(4.5)\n\nAny bispinor state is made by acting creation operators \u03b8\u03bc on the vacuum\nstate |[C]i.\nIn particular, a state\n\u2020\n|Dpi = \u03b8p\u2020 \u03b8p\u22121\n* * * \u03b80\u2020 |[C]i\n\n(4.6)\n\nsatisfies the boundary condition for a Dp brane\n\u03b8\u03b1\u2020 |Dpi = 0, (\u03b1 = 0, * * * , p),\n\u03b8i |Dpi = 0, (i = p + 1, * * * , 9).\n\n(4.7)\n\nTherefore, |Dpi can be identified with the zeromode part of the Dp-brane8 .\nIn particular, the vacuum state |[C]i is identified with the D-instanton.\nA gauge field on ND-branes is introduced through the superstring version\nof the Wilson loop factor in (3.1). For a constant flux F\u03b1\u03b2 , its contribution\n\u2032\n\u03b1 \u03b2\non RR-zeromodes is the factor e\u03c0\u03b1 F\u03b1\u03b2 \u03b8 \u03b8 inside the trace in (3.2), where \u03b1, \u03b2\ndenote the directions along the D-brane. In our case of ND2/kD0-branes\nwrapping the torus T 2 , the flux has U(1) part only, and this factor can be\n8\n\nTo consider the GSO projection, we need to consider the two types of boundary\nconditions which are labeled by \u03b7 = \u00b11. Here, we only write the formula for the \u03b7 = +1\ncase, and do not write the \u03b7 explicitly. See the appendix.\n\n17\n\n\fput outside the trace. Thus, the relevant part of the boundary state for\nND2/kD0-branes is given by\n\u2032\n\n1 2\n\n|D2D0i = Ne2\u03c0\u03b1 F12 \u03b8 \u03b8 |D2i\n= N(1 + 2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032 F12 \u03b81 \u03b82 )|D2i\n= N|D2i + k|D0i ,\n\n(4.8)\n\nwhere (3.8) is inserted. We included the factor N coming from the trace\nwhich was already present in (3.12). This state satisfies the required mixed\nboundary condition\n\u03b8\u03b1\u2020 |D2D0i = 2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032F\u03b1\u03b2 \u03b8\u03b2 |D2D0i ,\n\n(4.9)\n\nwhere \u03b1, \u03b2 = 0, 1, 2 and F0\u03b1 = 0.\nNow we perform the T-duality transformation on this state. The Tduality of the oscillator part of the fermion is obtained by changing the sign\nof the right mover oscillator mode \u03c8\u0303n \u2192 \u2212\u03c8\u0303n . On the other hand, T-duality\ntransformation of the zeromode for the \u03b1-direction can be represented by an\noperator T\u03b1 as\nT\u03b1 = \u03b8\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b8\u03b1\u2020 ,\n(4.10)\n\nwhich maps T\u03b1 \u03b8\u03b2 T\u03b1\u2020 = \u2212\u03b8\u2020\u03b2 and T\u03b1 \u03b8\u2020\u03b2 T\u03b1\u2020 = \u2212\u03b8\u03b2 , and satisfies T\u03b1\u2020 T\u03b1 = 1 and\nT\u03b1 T\u03b1 = \u22121. This kind of transformation is used in [11] for the T-duality\nrule of RR-potentials, in the context of the chiral spinor representation of\nRR-potential under the T-duality group [10, 12]. One easily checks that the\nT\u03b1 maps a boundary state (4.6) of a Dp-brane to that of a D(p + 1) or a\nD(p \u2212 1) brane, depending on whether the direction of the T-duality map is\nperpendicular or parallel to the Dp brane, respectively.\nIn our case, we take the T-duality of (4.8) for both directions along the\nT 2 . By applying the T-duality operator T2 T1 , it is easy to check that\n|D2D0i\u2032 = T2 T1 |D2D0i = k|D2i \u2212 N|D0i .\n\n(4.11)\n\nThis is again the replacement (N, k) \u2192 (k, \u2212N). Thus, the Nahm transformation of the T 2 and the T-duality transformation of the boundary state are\nalso consistent in the fermionic sector.\nNote that there are several sign (or phase) ambiguities in the above construction. First, the sign of (4.6) in the definition is ambiguous, because it\nis only constrained by boundary conditions (4.7). Next, there is a phase ambiguity in the definition of the T-duality transformation (4.10), in general.\n18\n\n\fIn fact, our choice includes the minus sign in T\u03b1 \u03b8\u03b2 T\u03b1\u2020 = \u2212\u03b8\u2020\u03b2 . Finally, our\nordering T2 T1 of the T-duality along T 2 is minus of another ordering T1 T2 .\nAll these ambiguities would change sign in boundary states before (4.8) and\nafter the T-duality (4.11). However, the relative sign change encoded in\n(N, k) \u2192 (k, \u2212N) is always true, irrespective of the choices discussed above.\n\n4.2\n\nConsistency of the Chern-Simon coupling\n\nThe RR-charges carried by a boundary state of D-branes are measured by\nthe coupling to closed-string states of RR-potentials. Here, we construct\nsuch states and study their T-duality transformation, then we show that the\nChern-Simons coupling is T-duality invariant. After that, we compare it with\nthe existing T-duality rule at the low energy effective theory.\nAs is argued in [35] and also in [39], the RR-state for a RR q-form gauge\npotential A = A\u03bc1 ***\u03bcq dx\u03bc1 * * * dx\u03bcq (not field strength) in the asymmetric picture can be constructed on the vacuum state |[C]i. To calculate the overlap\nwe need its conjugate state, which we define as follows:\nh[C]| = h\u00c3, \u22121/2|[C]AB hB, \u22123/2|e\u2212i\u03b20\u03b3\u03030 ,\n\n(4.12)\n\nwhere the action of the fermionic zeromodes on the tensor state are\n\u22121\nh\u00c3| \u2297 hB|\u03c8\u03bc = \u221a h\u00c3| \u2297 \u0393B\n\u03bc,C hC| ,\n2\ni\nh\u00c3| \u2297 hB|\u03c8\u0303\u03bc = \u221a (\u039311 \u0393\u03bc )A C hC\u0303| \u2297 \u0393B\n11,D hD| .\n2\nOne can see that the state (4.12) satisfies\nh[C]|\u03b8\u03bc\u2020 = 0 , h[C]|\u03b8\u03bc = h[\u2212C\u0393\u03bc ]| .\nThe RR-state for antisymmetric tensor potentials can be defined as\nX\nhA| = h[C]|A = h[C]|\nA\u03bc1 ***\u03bcq \u03b8\u03bc1 * * * \u03b8\u03bcq .\n\n(4.13)\n(4.14)\n\n(4.15)\n\n(4.16)\n\nAt this stage the summation is over any q-forms (q = 0, 1, * * * , 10). To restrict\nthe state to the physical state we perform the GSO projection:\n[GSO] =\n\n(1 \u2212 (\u22121)F0 +G0 )(1 + (\u22121)p+F\u03030 +G\u03030 )\n,\n4\n19\n\n(4.17)\n\n\fwhich also selects the rank of the antisymmetric tensor field according to the\ntype of the superstring (p even/odd for type IIA/IIB, respectively). In general, the state (4.16) depends on bosonic zeromodes (momentum/winding)\nhn; m|, however, it is sufficient to consider states with h0; 0| in the following.\nThe T-duality transformation of the RR-state is also given by the operators T\u03b1 (4.10)9 . For the conjugate state (4.16), the T-dual of the direction\nx1 and x2 , which is relevant to our analysis, is given by\nX\n(4.18)\nA\u03bc1 ***\u03bcq \u03b8\u03bc1 * * * \u03b8\u03bcq T1\u2020 T2\u2020 .\nhA\u2032| = hA|T1\u2020 T2\u2020 = h[C]|\n\nIt is straightforward to evaluate:\n\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\nhA|T1\u2020 T2\u2020 = h[C]|(A(0) + A1 \u03b81 + A2 \u03b82 + A12 \u03b81 \u03b82 )T1\u2020 T2\u2020\n(1)\n(1)\n(2)\n= h[C]|(A(0) \u03b81 \u03b82 \u2212 A1 \u03b82 + A2 \u03b81 \u2212 A12 ) ,\n\n(4.19)\n\nwhere we have expanded the sum of RR-potentials A in terms of \u03b81 and \u03b82 .\nNote that the coefficients A(k) do not contain \u03b81 or \u03b82 .

The overall sign is again ambiguous, depending on the convention, but\nthe relative sign is always present.\nWe will now show that the coupling of the RR-potentials to the D-brane\nICS = hA|[GSO]c0c\u03030 |Bi ,\n\n(4.21)\n\nis invariant under the T-duality. |Bi denotes the full (bosonic plus fermionic)\nboundary state, including the Wilson loop factor. By combining the Tduality rule for RR-potentials (4.19) and the boundary state (4.11), it is\nstraightforward to show this. Furthermore, the invariance of the ChernSimons coupling follows rather trivially from our construction.\nNote first that the non-zero bosonic and fermionic modes do not contribute to the RR-coupling (4.21). Then, if we concentrate on the h0; 0| state\nfor RR-potential, the T-duality transformation of the zeromode part of the\ncorresponding amplitude is performed by applying the T-duality operator\n9\n\nIn general, for a state with h~n; m|,\n~ its T-dual includes the exchange of ~n and m\n~ as\nwell as the extra phase as in (3.15).\n\n20\n\n\fT = \u03a0\u03b1 T\u03b1 , where \u03b1 are the directions of the T-duality transformation.

Taking this twice into account, we can rewrite (4.22) as\nICS = hA|T \u2020 [GSO]c0c\u03030 T |Bi = hA\u2032|[GSO]c0c\u03030 |B\u2032 i .\n\n(4.23)\n\nThe last expression is the RR-coupling after the T-duality transformation,\nwritten by (4.19) and (4.11). Therefore, we see that the Chern-Simons term\nis invariant under the T-duality transformation10 . This resolves the puzzle\non the sign raised in the discussion above. Starting from ND2/kD0-branes,\nboth the boundary state and the RR-potential require a relative sign through\nthe T-duality, and consequently the RR-charges are kept positive to give\nkD2/ND0-branes. It is instructive to see this again in terms of low energy\neffective theory, in the following.\nIt is known that the RR-coupling (4.21) can be represented in terms of\ndifferential forms [15, 16, 17] as\nZ\n\u2032\nICS = \u03bc2\nA \u2227 TrN (e2\u03c0\u03b1 F ) ,\n(4.24)\nM\n\nwhere \u03bc2 = T2 is the unit of D2-brane charge, M = R \u00d7 T 2 is the worldvolume, A is a sum of RR-potentials (odd forms in type IIA) and F is\ncurvature 2-form. This is obtained by identifying the operator \u03b8\u03bc with the\ndifferential form dx\u03bc , and taking the bosonic zeromodes into account to give\nthe worldvolume integral (for a derivation, see for example [36, 40] and also\nAppendix.). In our gauge configuration (2.18), this reduces to\nZ\n(2)\nICS = \u03bc2\n(A(0) + * * * + A12 dx1 \u2227 dx2 )(N + kdx1 \u2227 dx2 )\nM\nZ\nZ\n(2)\n1\n2\n= N\u03bc2\nA12 dx \u2227 dx + k\u03bc0 A(0) ,\n(4.25)\n\u221a\n\nM\n\nR\n\nwhere \u03bc0 = (2\u03c0 \u03b1\u2032 )2 \u03bc2 is the unit of D0-brane charge, and we have used the\nsame notation for the RR q-form field as (4.19). Of course, only the 3-form\n10\n\nFor the RR-state with fixed non-zero bosonic zeromodes h~n; m|,\n~ (4.21) is not invariant,\nbut the T-dual gives the coupling to hm;\n~ ~n|. The phase factor does not contribute to it.\n\n21\n\n\fA012 and the 1-form A0 survive in this expression, and this gives the correct\nRR-coupling for ND2/kD0-branes.\nThe transformation rule (4.20) can be represented in terms of differential\nforms in a compact form as\nZ\ni\n\u2032\nA =\u2212\nAedx \u2227dyi ,\n(4.26)\nT2\n\nwhere A\u2032 is the T-dual RR antisymmetric field with \u03b81 , \u03b82 being replaced\nby dy 1, dy 2 and \u03b8k (k 6= 1, 2) replaced by dxk , respectively. Up to an overall\nsign, this expression of the T-duality rule for RR q-form field is known as the\n\"Hori formula\" [13].\n\u2032\nOn the other hand, the term TrN (e2\u03c0\u03b1 F ) in the Chern-Simons term (4.24)\nis the string theory counterpart of the Chern character ch(E). Since we have\nshown the consistency between T-duality and Nahm transformation, its Tdual is also written similar to the family index formula (2.10) as\nZ\n1\ni\n\u2032\n2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032 F\u0303\n) =\nTrk (e\nedx \u2227dyi \u2227 TrN (e2\u03c0\u03b1 F )\n2\n\u2032\n(2\u03c0) \u03b1 T 2\n= k \u2212 Ndy 1 \u2227 dy 2,\n(4.27)\nwhere F\u0303 is the dual curvature 2-form corresponding to (2.27). Note that\nthe Chern character of the Poincar\u00e9 bundle ch(P ) in (2.10) appears in both\n(4.26) and (4.27) with a slight modification.\nBy using these two transformations (4.26) and (4.27), we obtain\nZ\nZ\n\u2032(2)\n\u2032\n2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032 F\u0303\n\u03bc2\n) = \u03bc2\nA \u2227 Trk (e\n(A\u2032(0) + * * * + A12 dy 1 \u2227 dy 2)(k \u2212 Ndy 1 \u2227 dy 2 )\nM\u0303\nM\u0303\nZ\n(2)\n= \u2212\u03bc2 (\u2212NA12 dy 1 \u2227 dy 2 \u2212 kA(0) dy 1 \u2227 dy 2)\nZ\nZ\n(2)\n1\n2\n= N\u03bc2\nA12 dy \u2227 dy + k\u03bc0 A(0) ,\n(4.28)\nM\u0303\n\nR\n\nwhere M\u0303 = R \u00d7 T\u0303 2 . This shows the invariance of the Chern-Simons term,\nas required. As we have already remarked, each transformation rule of RRpotentials (4.26) or the gauge flux (4.27) is ambiguous in its overall sign. It\nis necessary in our convention that (4.26) has a overall minus sign to obtain\na consistent and T-duality invariant Chern-Simons coupling of the brane and\nq-form field.\n22\n\n\f5\n\nConclusion and Discussion\n\nWe have investigated the compatibility of various T-duality rules represented\nin various forms, in the case of the ND2/kD0-bound state on a torus T 2 .\nFirst, we described in detail the two dimensional version of the Nahm\ntransformation, which interchanges the rank N of the gauge group and the\nflux k as (N, k) \u2192 (k, \u2212N) together with the map T 2 to T\u0303 2 , emphasizing\nthe relative sign.\nWe have then proved the equivalence of the Nahm transformation with the\nT-duality transformation in superstring theory by constructing the consistent\nextension of the boundary state description of magnetized D-branes on tori\nto the superstring.\nHere, the T-duality transformation of the RR-zeromode sector has to be\nconsidered carefully. We followed the construction of the boundary state\ngiven in [35, 36], except for introducing a new representation of the zeromodes. With this representation the boundary state and the RR-states are\ntreated in a seamless way, and in particular, the T-duality invariance of the\nChern-Simons term becomes transparent. We also introduced the T-duality\noperator for the zeromode part which acts both on the boundary state and\nthe RR q-form state, that was first introduced to describe the Buscher rule\nof RR-potentials in [10, 11, 12]. This clarifies the relationship between Tduality rule at the superstring level, and that at the low energy effective\ntheory. The so-called 'Hori formula' [13] has also been derived including a\nconsistent sign factor. As a result, we showed the compatibility among the\nT-duality, Buscher rule (Hori formula, (4.26)) and the Nahm transform (family index formula, (4.27)).\nThe overall sign appearing in these formulae indicates a Z4 -duality nature of the T-duality. It is a well known fact that the square of the Fourier\ntransformation, i.e., performing two Fourier transformations in sequence,\ndoes not give back the original function but the function where the variable x is replaced by \u2212x, the \"parity transformed function\". It means\n(~x, p~) \u2192 (~p, \u2212~x) \u2192 (\u2212~x, \u2212~p). To get back to the original function, one\nmust perform the Fourier transform 4 times, called Z4 -duality.\nThe same property holds for the Nahm transformation, which is a special\ncase of Fourier-Mukai transformation. Symbolically, we can write (N, k) \u2192\n(k, \u2212N) \u2192 \u2212(N, k). As remarked in \u00a72, the second Nahm transformation\nis the inverse one, i.e., the Dirac zero modes are left-handed spinors. The\n23\n\n\fminus sign in front of the third item denotes the overall minus sign in front\nof the family index formula. Similarly, RR-potentials get the overall minus\nsign when we transform them twice by the Hori formula. These are simply\nthe consequence of the square of the T-duality. In fact, for T = T2 T2 we have\nT 2 = \u2212T22 T12 = \u22121.\nOn the other hand, T-duality is usually designed to be a Z2 -duality [12].\nThis is possible because we can redefine both RR-potentials and the boundary state by a minus sign using the sign ambiguity. But we emphasize that\nthey have to be simultaneously redefined so that their overlap is unchanged.\nIt is interesting to extend our analysis to a higher even-dimensional torus\nT (d: even), where the Nahm transformation interchanges the rank and\nhigher Chern numbers. For example, there are so-called toron solutions on\nT 4 corresponding to D4/D2/D0-bound states [41].\nThe discrete T-duality considered in this paper is a part of the full Tduality group O(2, 2; Z) for T 2 and O(d, d; Z) for T d . Corresponding Tduality rules for bosonic boundary states [25, 26], and for RR-potentials\n[10, 11, 12] are known. This suggest that there is an O(d, d; Z)-family of\nNahm transformations. However, for d = 2, this family includes not only\nD2/D0-bound states but also tilted D-strings and a state of D0-branes only.\nEven if restricting to type IIA theory and the subgroup SO(d, d; Z), the\nNahm transformation should relate gauge theories of various (even) dimensions. This in one way leads to the derived category viewpoint on D-brane\nbound states, and the corresponding Nahm transformation would be the\nFourier-Mukai transformation. Another possibility is to use scalar fields on\nlower dimensional D-branes. For example, D2/D0-bound states described\neither by D2-branes with non-trivial gauge bundles on T 2 , or by D0-branes\nwith non-trivial scalar configurations. The latter picture is widely used in\nconstructing gauge theories on the dual torus in terms of matrix models of\nD0-branes, but the complete description in terms of boundary states is not\nclear, as opposed to the R2 case [42]. There are some previous attempts\n[43, 44] on this subject for a torus. Once it is known, the connection of the\nT-duality and the Morita equivalence becomes more transparent.\nAn odd sequence of discrete T-dualities is also interesting, because it\nrelates type IIA and type IIB theory, as mirror symmetry. In order treat\nall RR-states as a single O(d, d; Z) multiplet, it is important to perform the\ntransformation before GSO projection. In this sense, we believe that our new\nrepresentation of RR-zeromodes serves as suitable basis for further study on\nd\n\n24\n\n\fsuch cases.\n\nAcknowledgment\nThe authors would like to thank M.

Since we introduced a new representation for the zeromode part, we\nsummarize the construction of the relevant parts of the boundary state here.\nThe basic OPE of the fermionic field on the world sheet and spin operators are specified by the 10 dimensional gamma matrices \u0393\u03bc . We take the\nfollowing choice\n1\n1\n\u03c8 \u03bc S\u2212 1 A \u223c \u221a \u0393\u03bcAB S\u2212B 1 , \u03c8\u0303 \u03bc S\u0303\u2212 3 A \u223c \u221a (i\u039311 \u0393\u03bc )AB S\u0303\u2212B 3 ,\n(A.1)\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\nwhere rightmovers are distinguished from the leftmovers by a tilde. Here, we\nintroduced the factor i\u039311 for the rightmovers. This convention is different\nfrom the representation given in [35], but it has the advantage that it simplifies the definition of the boundary states and it provides a seamless treatment\nof the RR-antisymmetric tensor field state and the boundary state.\nCorresponding to the spin operators, we define the states |A, \u22121/2i and\n|B\u0303, \u22123/2i with spinor index A, B and pictures \u2212 21 , \u2212 32 , respectively11 . The\nRR-states of the closed string, on which we construct the boundary state, is\nasymmetric in the picture and given by the tensor product\n|A, \u22121/2i \u2297 |B\u0303, \u22123/2i .\n\n(A.2)\n\nThe zero modes of the fermion fields in the RR sector are represented by\nthe Dirac matrices on these states\n1\n1\n\u03c80\u03bc = \u221a (\u0393\u03bc \u2297 1) , \u03c8\u03030\u03bc = \u221a (\u039311 \u2297 i\u039311 \u0393\u03bc ) .\n(A.3)\n2\n2\n11\n\nWe distinguish the rightmover by the tilde on the index.\n\n25\n\n\fThe vacuum of the RR-sector which is an element of BRST infinite cohomology [35, 39] with an asymmetric background charge is then\n|[C]i = ei\u03b30 \u03b2\u03030 |A, \u22121/2iCAB |B\u0303, \u22123/2i ,\n\n(A.4)\n\nwhere CAB is the charge conjugation matrix and \u03b30 and \u03b20 are the zeromode\nof the \u03b2\u03b3 ghost in superstring. (We will suppress the tensor product in the\nfollowing.)\nThe zeromode part of the boundary state can be also constructed by the\nlinear combination of the above product states represented by using a matrix\nM\u03b7\u2032A B as\n|[CM\u03b7\u2032 ], \u03b7i = ei\u03b7\u03b30 \u03b2\u03030 |A, \u22121/2i[CM\u03b7\u2032 ]AB |B\u0303, \u22123/2i .\n(A.5)\nHere we introduced a parameter \u03b7 = \u00b1 to distinguish the boundary conditions. The Dirichlet condition along \u03bc-direction means to impose (Dirichlet\ncondition for \u03b7 = 1 is the same as the Neumann condition for \u03b7 = \u22121 and\nvice versa, i.e., |D, \u03b7i = |N, \u2212\u03b7i.)\n(\u03c80\u03bc + i\u03b7 \u03c8\u03030\u03bc )|[CM\u03b7\u2032 ], \u03b7i = 0 ,\n\n(A.6)\n\nand the corresponding condition for the ghosts. Using (A.3), we get the\ncondition for the matrix M\u03b7\u2032 as\n|[C(\u0393\u03bc M\u03b7\u2032 \u2212 \u03b7\u039311 M\u03b7\u2032 \u039311 \u0393\u03bc )], \u03b7i = 0 .\n\n(A.7)\n\nFor the D-instanton, the condition (A.7) must be satisfied for all \u03bc, and we\nobtain\n\u001a\n1 for \u03b7 = 1\n\u2032\n.\n(A.8)\nM\u03b7 =\n\u039311 for \u03b7 = \u22121\n\nIn the same way we can obtain the matrix M\u03b7\u2032 for the boundary state of a\nDp-brane. However, it is easier to use the operators \u03b8\u03bc introduced in (4.2).\nFor a Dp-brane the boundary state of the RR sector is proportional to [36]\n|Dp, \u03b7i = ei\u03b7\u03b30 \u03b2\u03030 |A, \u22121/2i[CM\u03b7\u2032 \u039301***p ]AB |B\u0303, \u22123/2i .\n\n(A.9)\n\nIt can be constructed by introducing the following operator:\n1\n\u03b8\u03b7\u03bc = \u221a (\u03c80\u03bc + i\u03b7 \u03c8\u03030\u03bc ) .\n2\n26\n\n(A.10)\n\n\fNote that\n\n1\n{\u03b8\u03b7\u03bc , \u03b8\u03b7\u03bd\u2020 } = (g \u03bc\u03bd + \u03b7 2 g \u03bc\u03bd ) = g \u03bc\u03bd .\n(A.11)\n2\nThe zeromode part of the boundary state of the Dp-brane is characterized\nby\n\u03b8\u03b7\u03bc\u2020 |Dp, \u03b7i = 0\n\u03b8\u03b7\u03bc |Dp, \u03b7i = 0\n\nfor\nfor\n\n\u03bc = 0, * * * , p (Neumann),\n\u03bc = p + 1, * * * , 9 (Dirichlet),\n\n(A.12)\n\nand obtained systematically by applying \u03b8\u03b7\u2020 on the D instanton state:\n\u03b8\u03b70\u2020 * * * \u03b8\u03b7p\u2020 |D(\u22121), \u03b7i = (\u2212\u03b7)p+1 |Dp, \u03b7i .\n\n(A.13)\n\nNote that the RR vacuum defined in (A.4) using the representation (A.3)\nis equivalent to the zeromode part of the boundary state of the D-instanton\n|D(\u22121), +i.\nThe coupling of the brane to the RR-antisymmetric tensor fields can be\nobtained by taking the pairing of the state of the RR-antisymmetric tensor\nfield with the boundary state. Since the picture of the boundary state is taken\nto be asymmetric, the RR state should be also prepared in the asymmetric\npicture [35, 38].\n\nA.2\n\nPairing of RR-state and Boundary state\n\nThe overlap given in (4.21) is the pairing of the RR p-form state hA| and\nthe boundary state |Bi. However, this expression has divergences. Following\nBillo et al.[35], we regularize it by the regulator x2(F0 +G0 ) and take the limit\nx \u2192 1 in the end. Thus we need to evaluate\nICS,x = h[CN]|x2(F0 +G0 ) [GSO]c0c\u03030 |[CM]i ,\n\n(A.14)\n\nwhere M and N are products of \u0393 matrices. Considering the ordering of the\nconjugate state in our convention, we define the inner product for the spinor\nstates as\n(h\u00c3|hB|)(|Ci|D\u0303i) = (C \u22121 )BC (C \u22121 )AD .\n(A.15)\nThen one can derive\n(h\u00c3|[CN]AB hB|)(|Ci[CM]CD |D\u0303i) = Tr{CNC \u22121 CMC t\u22121 } = \u2212Tr{NM}.\n(A.16)\n27\n\n\fFrom the \u03b2\u03b3-ghosts we get [35]\n1\u0303 3\nx\n1 3\u0303\nh\u2212 , \u2212 |ei\u03b71 \u03b20 \u03b3\u03030 x\u22122G0 ei\u03b72 \u03b30 \u03b2\u03030 | \u2212 , \u2212 i =\n.\n2 2\n2 2\n1 \u2212 \u03b71 \u03b72 x2\n\n(A.17)\n\nThe GSO projection operator is given in (4.17)\n[GSO]|[CM], +i =\n\n1X\n|[CM\u03b7\u2032 (M \u2212 (\u22121)p \u039311 M\u039311 )], \u03b7i .\n4 \u03b7=\u00b1\n\n(A.18)\n\nThe pairing of the boundary state with the states of the RR-potential (4.16)\ngives terms like\nh[CN]|x2F0 +2G0 |[CM\u03b7\u2032 K], \u03b7i = \u2212\n\nx\nTr{N(x\u22122|A| M\u03b7\u2032 )K},\n2\n1 + \u03b7x\n\n(A.19)\n\nwhere K = M \u2212 (\u22121)p \u039311 M\u039311 .
