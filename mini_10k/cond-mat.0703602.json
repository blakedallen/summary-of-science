number spin-correlation functions in the\nTwo dimensional square lattice Ising model\nRanjan Kumar Ghosh\u2217\nBidhannagar College\nEB-2,Salt Lake City,\nCalcutta-700 064, INDIA\nMarch 20, 2007\n\nAbstract\n\nThe Kramers-Wannier duality is shown to hold for all the even number spin correlation\nfunctions of the two dimensional square lattice Ising model in the sense that the high\ntemperature (T > Tc ) expressions for these correlation functions are transformed into\nthe low temperature (T < Tc ) expressions under this duality transformation.\n\nPACS: 05.70.Jk\nThe two dimensional Ising model remains one of the very few models for which\nmany properties can be calculated exactly[1,3,4,5,6,7,8,9] . Among these are the partition function and in principle all the multi-spin correlation functions for the case of\nthe square lattice (isotropic ) model. At least the algorithm for computing all the\nmultispin correlation functions is known[10,11 ].Quite a few of the two-spin correlation functions have been computed in terms of the complete elliptic integrals of the\nfirst and the second kind. It is also well known that the expression for the diagonal\ntwo-spin correlation functions for the anisotropic model have the same expression in\nterms of the complete elliptic integrals as that of the isotropic model. These correlation functions are known to satisfy a P ainleve\u2032 V I nonlinear ODE with a proper\ndefinition of the variables[13] . All these things perhaps make it arguably the most\nwidely studied model of ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism\nEven though the model is so widely studied, new properties of this model are being\ndiscovered from time to time. It is the purpose of this communication to discuss one\nof such properties of the model.\nThe very first sign that the model shows a phase transition from a disordered state\nto a ordered state was discovered by Kramers and Wannier[2] by considering what is\n\u2217\n\ne-mail address:- rkg 1978@yahoo.com\n\n1\n\n\fknown as the duality property of the partition function of the model. We give here\nthe Hamiltonian for the model which is\nH = \u2212J\n\nX\n\n[\u03c3i,j \u03c3i,j+1 + \u03c3i,j \u03c3i+1,j ]\n\n(1)\n\nn.n\n\nwhere \u03c3i,j = \u00b11, the products in the summation include only the nearest neighbours and i and j denote the positions of the spin on the lattice. The interaction\nstrength J is positive for the ferromagnetic model and negative for the antiferromagnetic model.\nThe partition function of the model can then be written as\nZ=\n\nX\n\nexp\u2212\u03b2H\n\n(2)\n\n\u03c3=\u00b11\n\nwhere\u03b2 = (kB T )\u22121 , and any multi-spin correlation function can be written as\n< \u03c3i,j \u03c3k,l * * * >=\n\n1 X\n\u03c3i,j \u03c3k,l * * * exp\u2212\u03b2H\nZ \u03c3=\u00b11\n\n(3)\n\nThe Kramers-Wannier duality can be understood by considering the high temperature and low temperature expansions of the partition function in the appropriate\nexpansion variables. It is seen that each of the configurations of the high temperature\nexpansion side has a counterpart in the low temperature expansion, and thus there\nis a one to one correspondence between the two phases of the theory. Kramers and\nWannier[2] used this high temperature -low temperature duality to find the critical\ntemperature for the model, the temperature at which the model undergoes a phase\ntransition. According to their calculations, the critical temperature is given by\n(sinh2\u03b2J)2 = 1\n\n(4)\n\nLater, in a celebrated paper, Onsager[3] calculated the exact partition function\nby considering the transfer matrix for this model, which proved the correctness of\nKramers-Wannier formula. The next quantity in line was the expctation value of a\nsingle spin, or in other words the spontaneous magnetization of the model, the form\nfor which was given by Onsager and proved by Yang[4] . Since then there were many\nnumerical calculations of the multispin expectation values which finally resulted in\nwriting down some of the two spin correlation functions of the model in terms of the\ncomplete elliptic integrals showing a beautiful structure of these functions when exact\nexpressions are written for these correlation functions in terms of these integrals[7,8,9] .\nIt was also clear that all the two-spin correlation functions can indeed be written in\nterms of the complete elliptic integrals.The two-spin correlation functions were also\n2\n\n\fshown to satisfy certain quadratic difference equations that were derived by Perk[12] .\nHowever it was not very clear how these quantities are related in the two phases of\nthe model.\nIn the meantime much work was done to understand the diagonal two-spin correlation functions and Jimbo and Miwa developed an equation that these correlation\nfunctions satisfy.General series solutions to this equation were dicussed in ref.[14,15,18] .\nFor the exact expressions for some of the correlation functions of this type the\nreader is referred to ref.[7,17]. We can take any of these expressions as a function of\nthe variable k = (sinh 2\u03b2J)2 or 1/k = (sinh 2\u03b2J)2 for T > Tc or T < Tc respectively\nand consider the following non linear transformation on it.\n1\nk\u2192\n(5)\nk\nK (k) \u2192 kK (k)\n(6)\n2\nE (k) + (k \u2212 1) K (k)\nE (k) \u2192\n(7)\nk\nThe last two transformation equations are just seen to be the correct transformation rules for the complete elliptic integrals from their transformation properties.\nUnder these transformations simultaneously, the high temperature (T > Tc ) expressions are seen to transform into the low temperature (T < Tc ) expressions and vice\nversa. This is true for all of the known diagonal two-spin correlation functions. However there is nothing special about these correlation functions and this property must\nbe true for all the spin correlation functions that can be written in terms of k and the\ncomplete elliptic integrals K (k) and E (k) and therefore this property must be true\nfor all the even number spin correlation functions, which share this dependence on k\nand the complete elliptic integrals. It is essentially seen to be the Kramers-Wannier\nduality at work again.\nWe now proceed to give a proof of the statement made above, from the Montroll, Potts and Ward's formulation[5] of even number spin correlation problem of the\nisotropic Ising model in terms of Pfaffians. In our notation, we will follow their paper\nas closely as possible.\nAt first we consider the case of the rectangular lattice Ising model. Its partition\nfunction is given by\nZ=\n\nX Y\n\nexp (\u03b2J1 \u03c3i,j \u03c3i,j+1 + \u03b2J2 \u03c3i,j \u03c3i+1,i )\n\n(8)\n\n\u03c3=\u00b11 n.n\n\nwhere \u03c3i,j = \u00b11 is the state of the spin at the (i, j) site of the lattice.i increases\nin one direction and j in the perpendicular direction. The product includes all the\n3\n\n\fnearest neighbours and the sum is over all the spins of the lattice. This, for the\nisotropic case J1 = J2 reduces to expression(1). The transition temperature of this\nmodel is given by\nsinh 2\u03b2J1 sinh 2\u03b2J2 = 1\n(9)\nWe introduce the variables\nz1 = tanh \u03b2J1\n\nz2 = tanh \u03b2J2\n\n(10)\n\nWith the help of these variables the partition function can be written as\nZ = (cosh \u03b2J1 cosh \u03b2J2 )N\n\nX Y\n\n(1 + z1 \u03c3i,j \u03c3i,j+1 )\n\n\u03c3=\u00b11 n.n\n\n\u00d7 (1 + z2 \u03c3i,j \u03c3i+1,j )\n\n(11)\n\nwhere N is the total number of spins on the lattice. The even number spin correlation functions can be formally written down as\n< \u03c30,0 \u03c3m,n \u03c3p,q * * * >= Z \u22121 (cosh \u03b2J1 cosh \u03b2J2 )N \u00d7\n\nX\n\n\u03c30,0 \u03c3m,n \u03c3p,q * * *\n\n\u03c3=\u00b11\n\n\u00d7\n\nY\n\n(1 + z1 \u03c3i,j \u03c3i,j+1) (1 + z2 \u03c3i,j \u03c3i+1,j )\n\n(12)\n\nn.n\n\nwhere the product of spins on the l.h.s. contains an even number of spins.Following\nref.[5] we can connect pairs of spins by (non overlapping) continuous line segments\n2\nand we can introduce the factors of \u03c3j,k\n= 1 along those links and then arrange the\nresulting expression in such a way that it is related to the original partition function\nwith a perturbed interaction strength along those links. One can then relate this\nexpression to the Pfaffians by the usual correspondence.\nAs discussed by the authors of ref.[5], this results in expressions which contain\nterms and integrals which can be related to the complete elliptic integrals of the first\nand the second kind in the case when we have the interaction strengths equal along\nboth the vertical and horizontal directions, i.e, we have a square lattice.\nIf we take the argument of these integrals to be the variable k in one phase of\nthe system then the expressions for the other phase are obtained by simply replacing\nk by k1 everywhere in the expressions because there is only one expression for the\ncorrelation functions in terms of the Pfaffians, the one given by equation(12).To make\nthe argument clearer, we take one of the simplest cases, the case of < \u03c30,0 \u03c30,1 > which\nis also one of the cases discussed in ref[5].The generalization of the logic is obvious\nand therefore this case illustrates the properties of the general even number spin\ncorrelations quite simply. In the notation of ref.[5] this two-spin correlation function\n\n4\n\n\fis given by\n< \u03c30,0 \u03c30,1 >=\n\n\u0011\nX \u0010\n1\n1 + z1\u22121 \u03c30,0 \u03c30,1\nz1 (cosh \u03b2J1 cosh \u03b2J2 )N\nZ\n\u03c3=\u00b11\n\n\u00d7\n\n\u2032\nY\n\n(1 + z1 \u03c3i,j \u03c3i,j+1 ) (1 + z2 \u03c3i,j \u03c3i+1,j )\n\n(13)\n\nn.n\n\nwhere the prime shows that the factors containing the product of spins which have\noccured previously in the expression have to be omitted in the later product.\nafter going through some arguments this expression can be written as the product\nof the Pfaffian of\n#\n\"\n\u0010\n\u0011\n0 1\n\u22121\n(14)\nz1 \u2212 z1\n\u22121 0\nand the Pfaffian of\n\uf8ee\n\n\uf8ef\n\uf8f0 \u0010\n\n0\nz1\u22121\n\n\u2212 z1\n\n\u0011\u22121\n\n\u2212\n\u2212 [0, 1]RL\n\n\u0010\n\nz1\u22121\n\n\u2212 z1\n\n\u0011\u22121\n\n0\n\n\uf8f9\n\n+ [0, 1]RL \uf8fa\n\uf8fb\n\n(15)\n\nand z1 , where [0, 1]RL is one of the elements of the matrix defined in the ref.[5]. The\nnet result of all this is that\n\u0010\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n< \u03c30,0 \u03c30,1 >= \u00b1 z1 \u2212 1 \u2212 z12 [0, 1]RL\n\n\u0011\n\n(16)\n\nThis for the isotropic case whenz1 = z2 = z = tanh \u03b2J yields\n\u0010\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n< \u03c30,0 \u03c30,1 >= \u00b1 z \u2212 1 \u2212 z 2 [0, 1]RL\n\n\u0011\n\n(17)\n\nHowever the z as well as the element [0, 1]RL can be written in terms of the variables\nk = (sinh2\u03b2J)2 or the low temperature expansion variable for which k1 = (sinh2\u03b2J)2 .\nAs is clear the double integral expressions for the matrix elements involved can be\nwritten in term of complete elliptic integrals with the modulus k in the high temperature phase and modulus k1 in the low temperature phase. One therefore just has\nto look for the transformation properties of the complete elliptic integrals under the\ntransformation\n1\nk\u2192\nk\nand these are seen to be given by the equations (6) and (7)1 .\n1\n\nsee for example ref.[16]\n\n5\n\n\fThis therefore has provided us with a very important tool for relating the high temperature expressions to the low temperature expressions and vice versa. In general\nthis means that we actually only need to know the T < Tc expressions for any arbitrary correlation function because the correlation functions involving an odd number\nof spins vanishes in the high temperature phase. Thus just the knowledge of T < Tc\nexpressions provide a complete description of the system.\nAs a special case of these relations, in the P ainleve\u2032 V I equation of Jimbo and\nMiwa, the solutions for integral values of n in the two phases are related to each\nother by the above mentioned transformations. But,of course, this remark is applicable only for the exact solutions and is not applicable to the series solutions of this\nequation term by term.\nWe have thus learnt that the Kramers-Wannier duality has a greater validity than\nbeing applicable only to the partition function of the square lattice Ising model, it\nextends to all the even number spin-correlation functions of the model.\n\nReferences\n[1] B.M.McCoy and T.T.Wu, The Two-dimensional Ising model (Harvard University\nPress,Cambridge,1973), and the references therein.
