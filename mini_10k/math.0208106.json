Sep 2002\n\nConstruction of p-adic Hurwitz spaces\nPatrick Erik Bradley\nAbstract\nModuli spaces for Galois covers of p-adic Mumford curves by Mumford curves are\nconstructed using Herrlich's Teichm\u00fcller spaces, Andr\u00e9's orbifold fundamental groups,\nand Kato's graphs of groups encoding ramification data of charts for Mumford orbifolds.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nHurwitz spaces are moduli spaces for finite branched covers of curves. Subspaces of their p-adic\nversions are moduli spaces for covers of Mumford curves, i.e. Schottky uniformisable curves. In\nthis paper we give a description of special kinds of such spaces parametrising Galois covers of\nMumford curves by Mumford curves.\nThese so-called Mumford-Hurwitz spaces turn out to be a finite disjoint union of equidimensional\nmoduli spaces of N-uniformisable Mumford curves, where N runs through some special type of\nfinitely generated groups: Bass-Serre fundamental groups of graphs of groups. For such moduli\nspaces, there exists a theory of Teichm\u00fcller spaces [Her85]. This allows to \"bundle together\"\nthose moduli spaces involved by examining which quotients of Y. Andr\u00e9's orbifold fundamental\ngroup are Bass-Serre fundamental groups for charts of a given reference orbifold. The finiteness\nof the number of components then boils down to giving bounds for the number of vertices of\npossible graphs.\nEquidimensionality of all components is achieved by relating the number of branch points to\nthe dimension of the Teichm\u00fcller spaces involved. This p-adic counterpart of the well-known\ncomplex result does not seem to have been mentioned in the literature, so far.\nWe adopt Berkovich's language of p-adic strictly analytic spaces [Ber90] and make use of Andr\u00e9's\ntheory of orbifold fundamental groups from [AndIII] which was developed for studying differential equations on one-dimensional orbifolds allowing covers by Mumford curves: we call these,\nfollowing [Kat01], Mumford orbifolds.\nIn Section 2, we give a very brief overview of the theory of temperate fundamental groups,\np-adic orbifolds and their fundamental groups.\nSection 3 reviews Teichm\u00fcller spaces and moduli spaces of Mumford curves from the point of\nview of p-adic geometry. It reveals that Herrlich's Teichm\u00fcller spaces parametrise uniformisations of Mumford orbifolds.\nIn Section 4, the actual construction of Mumford-Hurwitz spaces is performed, and the finiteness\nresult is proven: a main ingredient is the quotient pasting of Kato trees, used in [Brad02a] for\nobtaining formulae for the number of branch points. The section ends with some examples.\nThe results of this paper can be found in the author's dissertation [Brad02] of which we recommend sections 2 and 3 as a quick introduction to the theory of p-adic analytic spaces and to\nthe temperate and orbifold fundamental groups from [AndIII].\n1\n\n\f2\n2.1\n\nOrbifolds and orbifold fundamental groups\nThe temperate fundamental group\n\nFollowing [AndIII], we have\nDefinition 2.1. Let S be a p-adic manifold. A geometric point of S is an analytic map\ns\u0304 : M(\u03a9) \u2192 S, where (\u03a9, | |) is an algebraically closed, complete extension of (Cp , | |p ).\nAs \u03a9 is a normed Cp -algebra, M(\u03a9) is well-defined. In fact, it is a point, and with s :=\ns\u0304(M(\u03a9)) \u2208 S we shall always mean the image of the geometric point s\u0304.\nIn p-adic geometry, there are not enough topological covers of a given manifold. A remedy for\nthis, is to extend the definition of \"cover\" [dJ95]: a cover of S is an analytic map f : S \u2032 \u2192 S,\nsuch that there is an open covering U of S with the property\na\n\u2200 U \u2208 U : f \u22121 (U) =\nVi\ni\n\nand all restrictions f |Vi : Vi \u2192 U are finite. We see that in case all f |Vi are isomorphisms, we\nrecover the well-known notion of \"topological cover\".\nA morphism of covers of S is a commuting triangle\nan\n\nS\u2032 @\n\n@@\n@@\ncov @@\n\u001f\n\nS\n\n/ S \u2032\u2032\n}\n}}\n}}cov\n}\n}~ }\n\nThe resulting category is called CovS .\nThis is all a bit too general, but de Jong invents \"\u00e9tale\" covers as a special case in order to\nobtain a first sensible fundamental group. This turns out to be too big, so Andr\u00e9 becomes even\nmore special:\nDefinition 2.2. A cover g : S \u2032 \u2192 S is called temperate, if there is a topological cover T \u2032 \u2192 T\nand a commuting diagramme\nT\u2032\n\n/R\n\n/\n\nS\u2032\ng\n\ntop\n\n\u000f\n\nT\n\nalg\n\n/\n\n\u000f\n\nS\n\nwhere the upper horizontal arrow is a quotient over S, and the lower horizontal arrow is a finite\n\u00e9tale or algebraic cover: it is a finite morphism f and the f |Vi as above are \u00e9tale maps.\nThe sub-category of CovS of temperate covers is denoted by Covtemp\n.\nS\nAs fundamental groups act as permutations of fibres of covers, we define the geometric fibre of\na geometric point s\u0304 : M(\u03a9) \u2192 S of S for the cover f : S \u2032 \u2192 S to be the set of all lifts of s\u0304 to\ngeometric points of S \u2032 :\n\uf8fc\n\uf8f1\n\u2032\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nS\n<\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\ny\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\ny\n\u2032\n\uf8fd\n\uf8f2\ny\ns\u0304 y\nf\ny\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u22121\ny\ny\ncommutes .\nf (s\u0304) := s\u0304 : M(\u03a9) \u2192 S\ny\n\u000f\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n/\nM(\u03a9) s\u0304\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\nS\n\uf8fe\n\uf8f3\n2\n\n\fThe fibre functor is the covariant functor\nFS,s\u0304 : CovS \u2192 Sets, (f : S \u2032 \u2192 S) 7\u2192 f \u22121 (s\u0304).\nDefinition 2.3. The temperate fundamental group of S with base point s\u0304 : M(\u03a9) \u2192 S is\ntemp\n\u03c01temp (S, s\u0304) := Aut FS,s\u0304\n,\ntemp\nthe automorphism group of the restricted fibre functor FS,s\u0304\n:= FS,s\u0304 |Covtemp .\nS\n\nRemark 2.4. The temperate fundamental group is a pro-discrete topological group. A basis of\nopen neighbourhoods of 1 is the system of normal closed subgroups H such that \u03c01temp (S, s\u0304)/H\nis the Galois group of the universal topological cover of some algebraic Galois cover of S.\nIts pro-finite completion is the algebraic fundamental group (in case S is the analytification of\nan algebraic variety, the latter group coincides with the usual algebraic fundamental group).\nProof. The first part is [AndIII, 2.1.5.]. The second follows from [AndIII, 1.4.8], as the algebraic\ncovers of S form a full sub-category of Covtemp\n.\nS\n\n2.2\n\nThe orbifold fundamental group\n\nDefinition 2.5. A p-adic orbifold S = (S\u0304, (Zi , ei )) is a p-adic manifold S\u0304 together with a locally\nfinite family (Zi ) of irreducible divisors and natural numbers ei > 0, and which can be covered\nby orbifold charts, i.e. by analytic maps \u03c6 : W \u2192 V \u2286 S\u0304 with the properties\n\u2022 W is a p-adic manifold.\n\u2022 \u03c6 \u2208 CovV .\n\u2022 Outside Z :=\n\nS\n\nZi \u222a S\u0304sing , \u03c6 is a temperate Galois cover, ramified above Zi with index ei .\n\ni\n\nA morphism f : S\u2032 \u2192 S of orbifolds is a morphism S\u0304 \u2032 \u2192 S\u0304 such that S\u0304 \u2032 is covered with orbifold\ncharts \u03c6\u2032 : W \u2032 \u2192 V \u2032 and there exist orbifold charts \u03c6 : W \u2192 V \u2286 S\u0304 for which the diagramme\nW\u2032\n\n\u03c6\u2032\n\n/\n\nV\u2032\n\n/\n\nS\u0304 \u2032\nf\n\n\u000f\n\nW\n\n\u03c6\n\n/\n\nV\n\n/\n\n\u000f\n\nS\n\ncommutes.\nThe category of p-adic manifolds will be viewed as a full sub-category of the category of p-adic\norbifolds.\nDefinition 2.6. A morphism f : S\u2032 \u2192 S is called an orbifold cover if the underlying analytic\nmap f : S\u0304 \u2032 \u2192 S\u0304 is in CovS\u0304 , and for every orbifold chart \u03c6\u2032 : W \u2032 \u2192 V \u2032 \u2286 S\u0304 \u2032 the composition\nf \u25e6 \u03c6 : W \u2032 \u2192 f (V \u2032 ) is an orbifold chart of S\u0304.\nThis gives us a category CovS. If both S\u2032 and S are manifolds, then an orbifold cover is nothing\nbut a temperate cover.\nIf an orbifold\nhas a global orbifold chart, it will be called uniformisable. Let S := S\u0304 \\ Z, where\nS\nZ := Zi \u222a S\u0304sing .\ni\n\n3\n\n\fRemark 2.7. Let S be uniformisable and (f : S\u2032 \u2192 S) \u2208 CovS. Then the restriction f \u22121 (S) \u2192 S\nis a temperate cover.\nProof. [AndIII, 4.4.5]\nImportant is the following notion. Let a discrete group G act properly discontinuously on a\nconnected orbifold S = (S\u0304, (Zi , ei )). Then the orbifold quotient is the orbifold\nS/G := (S\u0304/G, (D * G, eD * |GD |)),\nwhere D runs through the Zi and the prime divisors of S\u0304 with non-trivial stabiliser GD , and\neD = 1 for D \u2208\n/ {Zi }.\nLet S be a uniformisable connected orbifold. Then Remark 2.7 gives us a restriction functor\nRes : CovS \u2192 Covtemp\n,\nS\nwhich is faithful [AndIII, 4.5.2].\nDefinition 2.8. Let s\u0304 be a geometric point of S = S\u0304 \\ Z for the uniformisable orbifold S. Then\n\u03c01orb (S, s\u0304) := Aut FS,s\u0304 ,\ntemp\nwhere FS,s\u0304 := FS,s\u0304\n|CovS , is called the orbifold fundamental group of S with base point s\u0304.\n\nThe orbifold fundamental group is a pro-discrete topological group, because of [AndIII, 1.4.7],\nand there exists a fundamental exact sequence for finite Galois orbifold covers:\n/G\n\nLemma 2.9. Let f : S\u2032 \u2212\u2192 S be a finite orbifold quotient cover. Then for every point s\u0304\u2032 of the\ngeometric fibre f \u22121 (s\u0304), the sequence\n1 \u2192 \u03c01orb (S\u2032 , s\u0304\u2032 ) \u2192 \u03c01orb (S, s\u0304) \u2192 G \u2192 1\nis exact.\nProof. Composing an orbifold cover of S\u2032 with f gives an orbifold cover of S, so there is a\nnatural morphism of topological groups\n\u03b1 : \u03c01orb (S\u2032 , s\u0304\u2032 ) \u2192 \u03c01orb (S, s\u0304).\nFor the injectivity of \u03b1, the proof of [AndIII, 1.4.12(b)] carries over: the system of all connected\nGalois orbifold covers factorising through f is cofinal in CovS. This implies that there is an\nAut(X \u2032 /S\u2032 ) into\nopen injective morphism from \u03c01orb (S\u2032 , s\u0304\u2032) = lim\n\u2190\u2212\nX \u2032 \u2208Cov \u2032\nS\n\nlim\n\u2190\u2212\nX \u2032 \u2208Cov \u2032\nS\n\nAut(X \u2032 /S) = lim\nAut(X/S) = \u03c01orb (S, s\u0304).\n\u2190\u2212\nX\u2208CovS\n\nThe arrow \u03b2 : \u03c01orb (S, s\u0304) \u2192 G exists and is surjective, because G is the automorphism group\nof an orbifold cover of S and as such G is a quotient of \u03c01orb (S, s\u0304). Here, ker \u03b2 is the set of all\n\u03b3 \u2208 \u03c01orb (S, s\u0304) fixing f \u22121 (s\u0304) pointwise. But this equals im \u03b1, as each \u03b3 \u2208 im \u03b1 lifts to a fibre\nautomorphism of s\u0304\u2032 .\n4\n\n\fRemark 2.10. In the following, we will use this exact sequence in the special case that S = S\u0304\nis a manifold: then \u03c01orb (S, s\u0304) = \u03c01temp (S, s\u0304).\nFor example, the orbifold S = (P1 , (0, 2), (1, 2), (\u221e, 2), (\u03bb, 2)) with \u03bb \u2208\n/ {0, 1, \u221e} is uniformisable\n/C2\n\nby an elliptic curve E \u2212\u2192 S given by the equation y 2 = x(x \u2212 1)(x \u2212 \u03bb) (we assume p 6= 2).\nThe exact sequence\n1 \u2192 \u03c01temp (E, 1)\u03c01orb (S, s\u0304) \u2192 C2 \u2192 1\nshows that\n\n(\n\u1e90 2 \u22ca C2 ,\nif |\u03bb||\u03bb \u2212 1| = 1 (good reduction)\n\u03c01orb (S, s\u0304) \u223c\n=\n(Z \u00d7 \u1e90) \u22ca C2 , if |\u03bb||\u03bb \u2212 1| =\n6 1 (Tate curve)\n\nThe temperate fundamental group of the Tate curve can be calculated from the sequence\n1 \u2192 \u03c01temp (Gm , 1) \u2192 \u03c01temp (E, 1) \u2192 \u03c01top (E, 1) \u2192 1\ncoming from the topological universal cover Gm \u2192 E, which can be seen as a quotient orbifold\ncover with \u03c01top (E, 1) acting freely on Gm (that is why the quotient is also a manifold) [AndIII,\n2.3.2]. In Section 4.3.1, we will study the action of C2 on the temperate fundamental group of\nan elliptic curve.\nDefinition 2.11. A Mumford orbifold is a one-dimensional orbifold S uniformisable by a global\nGalois orbifold chart S\u0304 \u2032 \u2192 S with a Mumford curve S\u0304 \u2032 . If the orbifold (P1 , (0, e0 ), (1, e1 ), (\u221e, e\u221e ))\nis a Mumford orbifold, it will be called a Mumford-Schwarz orbifold.\nIn the sequel, we will be dealing mostly with Mumford orbifolds.\n\n3\n3.1\n\nTeichm\u00fcller spaces\nMumford curves of genus g \u2265 2\n\nThe following theorem, of which we will give a short proof from [Brad02, Satz 3.12] using the\nBerkovich geometry of one-dimensional analytic spaces, is well-known:\nTheorem 1. If S is an irreducible non-singular projective algebraic curve defined over a large\nenough complete non-archimedean field K, then \u03c01top (S, s\u0304) is a finitely generated free group.\nProof. According to [Ber90, 4.3.2], S is a special quasi-polyhedron, its skeleton \u2206(S) is a\nsubgraph of the intersection graph \u2206an (S) of its stable reduction (this is where \"large enough\"\nenters), and \u2206(S) has the same Betti number as \u2206an (S) (at most g). Let \u03a9 \u2192 S be the\ntopological universal cover. As \u03c01top (S, s\u0304) also acts on \u2206(S) [Ber90, 4.1.8], we have a commuting\ndiagramme\n\u007f\n/\u03a9\n\u2206(\u03a9) \u001f\n/\u03c01top (S,s\u0304)\n\n/\u03c01top (S,s\u0304)\n\n\u000f\n\n\u2206(S) \u001f\n\u007f\n\n/\n\n\u000f\n\nS\n\nBecause of the retraction map \u03a9 \u2192 \u2206(S), this diagramme is Cartesian. Therefore the left\narrow going down is universal in the category of graph covers of \u2206(S). This implies \u03c01top (S, s\u0304)\nis the fundamental group \u03c01 (\u2206(S), a free group of rank at most g.\n5\n\n\fLet C be a Mumford curve of genus g \u2265 2 defined over Cp . Its stable reduction is a curve\ndefined over F\u0304p and whose intersection graph has genus g. Let \u0393 := \u03c01top (C, s\u0304), according to\n/\u0393\n\nTheorem 1 a free group of rank g, and let \u03a9 \u2212\u2192 C be the topological universal cover. \u03a9 is an\nanalytic subspace of P1Cp , and \u0393 acts discontinuously on it. This gives a faithful representation\nFg \u2192 PGL2 (Cp ) of the fundamental group as a Schottky group [GvP80].\nThe set Tg of faithful discontinuous representations Fg \u2192 PGL2 (Cp ) is known to be an open\nanalytic sub-domain of the affine Cp -variety Sg \u223c\n= PGL2 (Cp )g of all representations of Fg into\nPGL2 (Cp ) [Her84, Sect. 1]. PGL2 (Cp ) acts on Tg by conjugation, and\nT\u0304g := PGL2 (Cp )/Tg\nis the Teichm\u00fcller space for Fg .\nAccording to [Her84], \u0393g := Out Fg acts on the Teichm\u00fcller space, and the quotient Mg = T\u0304g /\u0393g\nis the moduli space of Mumford curves of genus g, which can be viewed as an analytic subspace\nof the moduli space Mg of all irreducible projective curves of genus g [L\u00fct83].\nIn order to prove connectedness and simple connectedness of Teichm\u00fcller space, Gerritzen\ndissects T\u0304g into inadmissible open parts Bg (\u0393) depending only on the possible stable reduction\ngraphs of Mumford curves. This gives the connectedness result for Mg which inadmissibly\nlocally looks like Bg (\u0393)/ Aut \u0393 [Ger81].\nFrom the Berkovich geometric viewpoint, the parts Mg (\u0393) := Bg (\u0393)/ Aut \u0393 are not disjoint-\nonly their sets of classical points are. In fact, intersections Mg (\u0393) \u2229 Mg (\u0393\u2032 ) consist of generic\npoints of discs D corresponding to families of Mumford curves parametrised by D whose skeletons are either \u0393 or \u0393\u2032 .\n\n3.2\n\nDiscontinuously uniformisable Mumford curves\n\nGeneralising the results of the preceding section, Herrlich constructs Teichm\u00fcller spaces for\nfinitely generated groups N [Her85]. In our language we ought to proceed thus: let T(N) be\nthe functor\nAn(Cp ) \u2192 Sets, S 7\u2192 {\u03c8 : N \u2192 Aut(P1S ) | \u03c8 is discontinuous},\nwhere a discontinuous representation \u03c8 over S is meant to be injective and for each geometric\npoint s\u0304 : K \u2192 S the induced representation \u03c8s\u0304 : N \u2192 PGL2 (K) is discontinuous.\nProposition 3.1. The functor T(N) is representable, i.e. a fine moduli space, and the following\nquotients\n1. T(N) := PGL2 \\T(N),\n2. M(N) := T(N)/ Out(N) and\n3. M(N, F ) := T(N)/ OutF (N)\nare well-defined, if N contains a free subgroup F of rank \u2265 2 and of finite index in N. In this\ncase, the first one is representable, and the other two lead to coarse moduli spaces.\nHere, OutF (N) means AutF (N)/ Inn(N), and AutF (N) := {\u03b1 \u2208 Aut(N) | \u03b1(F ) = F }.\n\n6\n\n\fProof. The first statement is Folgerung ii) on p. 149 in [Her87].\n1. is Folgerung on p. 151 in [Her87].\n2. is [Her87, Satz 2].\n3. can be proven the same way as 2. with some slight modifications.\nRemark 3.2. 1. The coarse moduli space M(N) parametrises so-called N-uniformisable covers\n/N\n\n\u03c6 : \u03a9\u2032 \u2212\u2192 C of Mumford curves of genus rk N ab which are temperate outside the branch locus. If\n(\u03b6i , ei ) are the branch points in C together with the orders of ramification, then \u03c6 is a global chart\nof the orbifold C = (C, (\u03b6i , ei )). So, the moduli space actually parametrises all N-uniformisable\nMumford orbifolds.\n2. M(F, N) parametrises commuting diagrammes\n/F\n\n/ C\u2032\nNNN\nNNN\nfinite\n/N NNNN \u000f\n&\n\n\u03a9\u2032 NNN\n\nC\n\nand is finite over M(N).\nProposition 3.3. If N contains a free group of rank \u2265 2, then T(N) is a simply connected\nanalytic space. Its finitely many components are (smooth) p-adic manifolds of dimension\n3g \u2212 3 + 2(C \u2212 c) + 3(D \u2212 d),\n|\n{z\n}\n=:n\n\nwhere n depends only on N and equals the number of branch points of the orbifold covers\n\u03a9(N) \u2192 C in M(N).\nProof. The rigid analytic version of this proposition is essentially Herrlich's habilitation thesis\n[Her85] or [Her87], except for the last statement.\nThe number n does not depend on the particular graph of groups with fundamental group\nisomorphic to N:\nFirst, n is the number of cusps in the Kato graph of a realisation of N as the Galois group\nof an orbifold cover \u03c6 : \u03a9 \u2192 C of a Mumford orbifold C [Brad02a, Theorem 2]. These cusps\ncorrespond bijectively to the branch points of \u03c6. As all vertex groups are finite, Khramtsov's\ncharacterisation of finite graphs of groups with isomorphic fundamental groups applies [Khr91]:\ntwo Kato graphs with the same fundamental group differ by a finite number of admissible edge\ncontractions or \"slides\" of an edge e along an element g \u2208 N stabilising one of e's extremities\nv. The latter means that the topological graph and all vertex and edge groups are the same,\nonly the embedding \u03b1 : Ne \u2192 Nv is replaced by cg \u25e6 \u03b1, where cg is conjugation by g \u2208 Nv . The\nformula in [Brad02a, Theorem 3] now shows that the number of cusps are the same for all Kato\ngraphs with the same fundamental group N.\n\n4\n4.1\n\nComponents of Hurwitz spaces\nG-covers\n\nLet S = (S\u0304, (\u03b6i , ei )) be a Mumford orbifold, and N a virtually free quotient of \u03c01orb (S, s\u0304) of\nrank \u2265 2 such that there exists a faithful discontinuous representation \u03c4 : N \u2192 PGL2 (Cp ).

N\u03c6 is a fundamental group of a graph of groups.\nProof. As F := \u03c01top (S\u0304 \u2032 , s\u0304\u2032 ) is free and of finite index in N\u03c6 , \u03a9\u2032 \u2286 P1Cp is the set of ordinary\npoints of N\u03c6 . If \u2206\u2032 := \u2206(\u03a9\u2032 ) is the skeleton of \u03a9\u2032 , then there is a retraction map \u03a9\u2032 \u2192 \u2206\u2032\n[Ber90, 4.1.6], and F acts on \u2206\u2032 [Ber90, 4.1.8].

According to the\n\u2032\n\u2032\nRiemann-Hurwitz formula, the genus g of S\u0304 is the same for all \u03c6 \u2208 KG (S). If g denotes the\ngenus of S\u0304, we can define:\n[\nHG (S) :=\nM(N\u03c6 , Fg\u2032 ),\n\u03c6\u2208KG (S)\n\n9\n\n\fwhere Fg\u2032 is the free group in g \u2032 generators sitting in the exact sequence\n1 \u2192 Fg\u2032 \u2192 N\u03c6 \u2192 G \u2192 1\nThe Hurwitz space for covers of Mumford orbifolds of genus g is obtained in the following way:\nlet\nMOrbg (e)\nbe the sub-category of the category of orbifolds consisting of the one-dimensional Mumford\norbifolds of genus g with ramification indexing sequence e := (e1 , . . . , en ).\nDefinition 4.5.

If \u03c6 : S\u0304 \u2032 \u2212\u2192 S is a finite global chart for S, and if S\u0304 \u2032 is a Mumford curve, then\nall vertex (and edge) stabilisers of the corresponding Kato graph are subgroups of G.\nProof.

The total chart number of all S \u2208 MOrbg (e) is finite, if stable models of Kato\ngraphs are counted without multiplicities.\nProof. We shall show that the number of vertices for graphs of fixed Betti number with n cusps\nis bounded from above. As the size of vertex stabilisers is also bounded by Lemma 4.6, this\nproves the theorem.\nLet first S be a rational Mumford orbifold, \u03c6 : S\u0304 \u2032 \u2192 S a chart with deck group G, and S\u0304 \u2032 a\nMumford curve. Abbreviating N := N\u03c6 , we assume further that the Kato tree \u0393\u2217 := \u0393\u2217 (N) is\nstable and that n \u2265 3.\nIn case \u0393\u2217 is irreducible, i.e. no edge stabiliser is trivial, [Brad02a, Proposition 15] implies that\nthe valency of any vertex in \u0393\u2217 is at most 3.\nLet v be a vertex in \u0393\u2217fin , and val(v) its valency in that tree. There are the following possibilities:\n1. val(v) = 1.\n2. val(v) = 2 and the Ne for both edges e emanating from v are cyclic.\n3. val(v) = 2 and Ne for an edge e emanating from v is non-cyclic.\n4. val(v) = 3.\nFor proving boundedness in each case, we rely on how \u0393\u2217 is obtained by glueing Kato trees for\nfinite groups. This is explained in the proof of [Brad02a, Theorem 2]. These trees have two\ncusps if the group is cyclic, and three cusps otherwise.\n1. In this case, v has a cusp emanating from it in \u0393\u2217 .\n2. Here, Nv is not cyclic, and v has a cusp in \u0393\u2217 .\n3. Let v = o(e), where e is an edge with Ne not cyclic. Then v(t(e)) = 3 in \u0393\u2217 , because Nt(e) is\nnot cyclic. So, here is a cusp going out of v.\n4. For each vertex v with val(v) = 3, there is at least one extremal vertex in \u0393\u2217fin . For such\nvertices, we are in case 1.\nFrom this, we see that the number of vertices in \u0393\u2217 is bounded.\nIn case \u0393\u2217 contains edges with trivial stabiliser, each maximal subtree without trivial edge\ngroups has at least one cusp going out. Such a subtree is called an irreducible component of \u0393\u2217 .\nThe number of irreducible components is therefore bounded.\nLet now S be of arbitrary genus. The considerations above for a fundamental domain, viewed as\na tree of groups, of \u0393\u2217 in its universal covering tree prove the theorem in this general case.\nCorollary 4.7. The Mumford-Hurwitz space Hg (G, e) is a coarse moduli space parametrising\nG-covers with signature e = (e1 , . . . , en ) of Mumford covers of genus g, and has only finitely\nmany components of equal dimension 3g \u2212 3 + n.\nProof. The moduli space property is given by Proposition 3.1. Equidimensionality has been\nproven in Proposition 3.3. The finiteness property of the Mumford-Hurwitz space follows from\nthe connectedness of each M(N\u03c6 ) (of which M(N\u03c6 , Fg\u2032 ) is a finite cover) and from the finiteness\nof the chart number (Theorem 2).\n\n11\n\n\f4.3\n4.3.1\n\nExamples\nTate orbifolds\n\nHere we study Galois covers of the Tate orbifold S\u03bb = (P1 , (0, 2), (1, 2), (\u221e, 2), (\u03bb, 2)). This\nmeans that G = C2 , the cyclic group of order two. Let p 6= 2. The rational orbifold S\u03bb can\nbe defined for all \u03bb 6= 0, 1, \u221e, but it is a global orbifold chart of Mumford type if and only if\n|\u03bb||\u03bb \u2212 1| =\n6 1. In fact, the equation\ny 2 = x(x \u2212 1)(x \u2212 \u03bb)\ndefines a chart \u03c6 : T \u2192 S\u03bb with Galois group C2 , and T is known to be a Tate elliptic curve if\nand only if |\u03bb||\u03bb| =\n6 1. We have\n\u2032\n\u2032\nH0 (C2 ; 2, 2, 2, 2) = {\u03bb \u2208 C\u00d7\n6 1} = M(C2 \u2217 C2 , Z).\np \\ {1} | |\u03bb ||\u03bb \u2212 1| =\n\nThe moduli space M(C2 \u2217 C2 , Z) is given by the chart\n/C2 \u2217C2\n\nC\u00d7\np \u2212\u2192 S\u03bb\ncoming from the universal topological cover of the Tate curve; it is a Galois cover whose group\n\u03c01BS (\u0393) \u223c\n= C2 \u2217 C2 comes from the cover of analytic skeletons viewed as graph with groups\n..........................................\n.........\n......\n............\n.\n..........\n......\n.........................................\n\nr\n\nr\n\n\u2744\nr\n\nr\n\nZ2\n\nZ2\n\nIn order to understand the associated surjection \u03c01orb (S\u03bb , s\u0304) \u2192 \u03c01BS (\u0393), we observe\nProposition 4.8. Let S\u03bb be as above. Then:\n1. If S\u03bb is a Tate orbifold, then the isomorphisms\n\u03c01orb (S\u03bb , s\u0304) \u223c\n= (Z \u00d7 \u1e90) \u22ca C2 \u223c\n= \u1e90 \u22ca (C2 \u2217 C2 )\nhold.\n2. If S\u03bb is not a Tate orbifold, then\n\u03c01orb (S\u03bb , s\u0304) \u223c\n= \u1e902 \u22ca C2 .\nIn both cases, C2 inverts each of the two topological generators of Z \u00d7 \u1e90, resp. \u1e902 , and in the\nfirst case both generators of C2 \u2217 C2 in the group on the right invert the topological generator of\n\u1e90.\n\n12\n\n\fProof. The first isomorphy in 1. as well as the isomorphy of 2. is shown in [AndIII, Remarks\n4.5.6.(c)], while the second isomorphy in 1. follows from Lemma 4.4: the diagramme is in our\ncase\n1\n1\n1\n\u000f\n/\n\n1\n\n1\n1\n\n/\n\n/\n\n\u1e90\n\u000f\n\nZ \u00d7 \u1e90\n/\n\n\u000f\n\nZ\n\n/\n\n\u000f\n/\n\n\u1e90\n\u000f\n\n\u000f\n\n\u03c01orb (S\u03bb , s\u0304)\n/\n\n\u000f\n\nZ2 \u2217 Z2\n\u000f\n\n\u000f\n\n1\n\n1\n\n\u000f\n\n1\n\n/\n\nZ2\n/\n\nZ2\n\n\u000f\n\n/1\n\n/1\n\n/1\n\n\u000f\n\n1\n\nFor the action of C2 , let \u03c6n : \u03a9n \u2192 T be a tempered cover of the elliptic curve T . In the case\nthat T has good reduction, \u03c6n is an isogeny. If T is a Tate curve, we may assume that \u03c6n\nis the composition of the universal cover of a Tate curve with an isogeny. In either case, \u03c6n\nis a homomorphism of Abelian groups. Let \u03c3n be the involution of \u03a9n lifting the involution\n\u03c3 : t \u2192 t\u22121 of T (we shall write T as a multiplicative Abelian group for obvious reasons). Any\nother lift of \u03c3 is of the form\n\u03c3n * \u03b5n : \u03a9n \u2192 \u03a9n , \u03c9 7\u2192 \u03c9 \u22121 * \u03b5n (\u03c9)\nwith \u03b5n (\u03c9) \u2208 ker \u03c6n . As \u03b5n is continuous and ker \u03c6n discrete, we find\n\u03b5n = const. = \u03c3n (1).\nNow, \u03c3 := (\u03c3n ) \u2208 \u03c01orb (S\u03bb , s\u0304) \\ \u03c01temp (T, 1\u0304), \u03b5 := (\u03b5n ) \u2208 \u03c01temp (T, 1\u0304), and the involution \u03c3 acts on\nthe Abelian group \u03c01temp (T, 1\u0304) by conjugation\n!\n\n\u03c01temp (T, 1\u0304) \u2192 \u03c01temp (T, 1\u0304), \u03b3 7\u2192 (\u03c3\u03b5) * \u03b3 * (\u03c3\u03b5)\u22121 = \u03c3\u03b3 \u22121 = \u03b3 \u22121 .\nThe last equality can be checked for each \u03c6n : Here the fibre \u03c6\u22121\nn (1) equals the Abelian deck\ntemp\ngroup Gn . Then each \u03b3n from \u03b3 = (\u03b3n ) \u2208 \u03c01 (T, 1\u0304) is the translation x 7\u2192 x * \u03b3n , and for all\nx \u2208 Gn we have\n\u03b3n\u03c3n (x) = \u03c3n \u03b3n \u03c3n (x) = \u03c3n \u03b3n (x\u22121 ) = \u03c3n (x\u22121 * \u03b3n ) = \u03b3n\u22121 * x = \u03b3n\u22121 (x) ,\nin other words, \u03b3 \u03c3n = \u03b3n\u22121 .\nAs C2 \u2217 C2 is the free product of two copies of h\u03c3i, the exact diagramme from the beginning of\nthe proof gives the last assertion.\nRemark 4.9. If T has good reduction, then the temperate fundamental group is the algebraic\nalg\nfundamental group, \u03c01temp (T, 1\u0304) \u223c\n= \u03c01 (T, 1\u0304), as temperate covers of T are all finite. In this case,\nit is known that C2 inverts each of the two topological generators of \u1e902 , for example by using\nthe fact, that this is the case in the complex situation for the (complex) topological fundamental\ngroup and that the pro-finite completion of the latter is the algebraic fundamental group. Thus,\nProposition 4.8 can be viewed as a generalisation of the good reduction case.\n13\n\n\f4.3.2\n\nTriangle groups\n\nA special type of rational Mumford orbifolds are Mumford-Schwarz orbifolds\nS(e0 , e1 , e\u221e ) = (P1Cp , (0, e0), (1, e1 ), (\u221e, e\u221e )).\nSuch an orbifold S(e0 , e1 , e\u221e ) is a quotient of a Mumford curve X, and if the genus of X is\n\u2265 2, it is called hyperbolic. The Bass-Serre fundamental group of a corresponding Kato graph\nis called a p-adic triangle group of Mumford type in the hyperbolic case.\nKato has proven that p-adic triangle groups of Mumford type exist only for p \u2264 5 [Kat00],\nmore exactly:\nTheorem 3 (Kato, 1999). There are infinitely many hyperbolic Mumford-Schwarz orbifolds\nfor p \u2264 5, and none for p > 5. For given ramification indices e0 , e1 and e\u221e there are only\nfinitely many p-adic triangle groups \u2206(e0 , e1 , e\u221e ) of Mumford type.\nThis also implies the finiteness of the chart number for Mumford-Schwarz orbifolds, a special\ncase of Theorem 2. In any case, we partially recover from Corollary 4.7:\nCorollary 4.10. The Mumford-Hurwitz space H0 (G; e0 , e1 , e\u221e ) is a finite set.\n1. If p > 5, then it is non-empty, only if G equals one of the finite \u2206(e0 , e1 , e\u221e ).\n2. It is non-empty for finite quotients of infinitely many infinite triangle groups, if p \u2264 5.\n4.3.3\n\nQuadrangle groups\n\nThe formula in [Brad02a, Theorem 2] and its proof imply that the only way to obtain Kato tree\nwith four cusps is by pasting two three-cusped Kato graphs along an elementary Kato graph\nwith two cusps:\n_@@\n@@\n@@\n@\n~\n~~\n~\n~\n~\n\u007f~\n\n\u2206\n\n/\n\ne\n\n+\n\neo\n\n}>\n}}\n}\n}\n}}\n\u2206\u2032 A\nAA\nAA\nAA\n\n_??\n??\n??\n?\n\n\u2740\n\u007f\u007f\n\u007f\u007f\n\u007f\n\u007f\u007f \u007f\n\n\u2206\n\nCe\n\n}>\n}}\n}\n}\n}}\n\u2206\u2032 A\nAA\nAA\nAA\n\nBy Theorem 3, \u2206 and \u2206\u2032 are both finite, if p > 5. In other words, The fundamental group is\nan amalgam of two finite groups. This has also been observed in [vdPV01] by different means.\nIn the case that p \u2264 5, one has only to check in Kato's list of amalgams [Kat00, Theorem\n(2)], where exactly the cusps emanate and what their decomposition groups are (an easy task).\nThen \"glue together\" two cusps with equal stabiliser Ce (as then one has an allowed segment\nof Herrlich's list [Her82]).\n4.3.4\n\nCyclic covers\n\nFrom Lemma 4.6 we get immediately\nProposition 4.11. Let S be any Mumford orbifold and \u03c6 \u2208 KCn (S). Then all vertex groups in\nthe Kato graph for \u03c6 are cyclic, and all edge groups are either trivial or equal to the stabiliser\nof one of its extremities.\n14\n\n\fThe Kato graph reveals the relative position of the branch points [Brad02a, Theorem 4], so we\nhave\nCorollary 4.12. If a Mumford orbifold S = (S\u0304, (\u03b61, e1 ), . . . , (\u03b6m , em )) admits a chart \u03c6 \u2208\nKCn (S), then m is even, and the branch points are separated by a pure affinoid covering of S\ninto pairs of branch points with equal decomposition group\nThe meaning of Proposition 4.11 in case S is of genus zero is that, if one stabilises the irreducible\ncomponents of a Kato tree of S, there remains only one vertex, i.e. one has an elementary Kato\ntree for the corresponding decomposition group.\nIn order to find the relative distances of the pairs of branch points in S, one has to calculate\nthe lengths of the edges joining the vertices from which cusps emanate. The subtleties lie in\nthe case that p divides the order of a vertex group. This dealt with in Sections 6.3 and 6.4 of\n[Brad02].\n\nAcknowledgements\nThe author expresses his gratitude to Y.
