KLIMCHUK1\n1\n\nSpace Science Division, Naval Research Laboratory, Washington, DC 20375, USA\n(29 November 2005)\n\nAbstract. The question of what heats the solar corona remains one of the most important problems\nin astrophysics. Finding a definitive solution involves a number of challenging steps, beginning\nwith an identification of the energy source and ending with a prediction of observable quantities\nthat can be compared directly with actual observations. Critical intermediate steps include realistic\nmodeling of both the energy release process (the conversion of magnetic stress energy or wave\nenergy into heat) and the response of the plasma to the heating. A variety of difficult issues must be\naddressed: highly disparate spatial scales, physical connections between the corona and lower\natmosphere, complex microphysics, and variability and dynamics. Nearly all of the coronal heating\nmechanisms that have been proposed produce heating that is impulsive from the perspective of\nelemental magnetic flux strands. It is this perspective that must be adopted to understand how the\nplasma responds and radiates. In our opinion, the most promising explanation offered so far is\nParker's idea of nanoflares occurring in magnetic fields that become tangled by turbulent\nconvection. Exciting new developments include the identification of the \"secondary instability\" as\nthe likely mechanism of energy release and the demonstration that impulsive heating in subresolution strands can explain certain observed properties of coronal loops that are otherwise very\ndifficult to understand. Whatever the detailed mechanism of energy release, it is clear that some\nform of magnetic reconnection must be occurring at significant altitudes in the corona (above the\nmagnetic carpet), so that the tangling does not increase indefinitely. This article outlines the key\nelements of a comprehensive strategy for solving the coronal heating problem and warns of\nobstacles that must be overcome along the way.\n\n1. Introduction\nStated simply, the coronal heating problem is to identify and understand the physical mechanism\nresponsible for heating the corona to multi-million degree temperatures, several hundred times\nhotter than the underlying photosphere. The problem first became apparent more than six decades\nago, when Grotrian (1939) and Edlen (1942) realized that emission lines seen during total solar\neclipses were not due to a new element dubbed \"coronium,\" but rather to known elements at very\nhigh stages of ionization. The extreme temperatures necessary for such ionization have puzzled\nsolar physicists ever since. There are no doubt many different heating mechanisms operating in the\ncorona, and the real goal is to determine which one is dominant, both in general and in specific\nsituations. A number of important questions must be answered. Are distinct coronal loops heated\ndifferently from the diffuse corona? Are there different classes of loops that are heated in different\n\n\f2\nways? Is quiet Sun heating similar to active region heating? Are stellar coronae heated in the same\nway as the solar corona?\nA number of plausible theories for coronal heating have been proposed, but it has proved\ndifficult to determine which ones, if any, are actually correct. Some of the theories are really not\nmuch more than conceptual ideas. Others are far better developed, but nonetheless rely on\nmodeling that is highly idealized or incomplete. This inadequate state of affairs should not be taken\nas an indictment of the discipline. Rather, it reflects the extreme difficulty of the problem. A\ndefinitive test of any coronal heating theory requires a quantitative prediction of observable\nquantities that is based on a detailed, first principles treatment. This is a monumental task, as we\nwill show.\nIt is instructive to think of the coronal heating problem as involving a number of separate\nsteps, as indicated in the \"coronal heating flowchart\" of Figure 1. We must identify a source of\nenergy and a mechanism for converting that energy into heat. We must determine how the plasma\nresponds to the heating. Finally, we must predict the spectrum of emitted radiation and its\nmanifestation as observable quantities. Only by accomplishing all of these steps can a truly\nrigorous and meaningful comparison with actual observations be made.\nMost coronal heating studies have focused on restricted parts of the flowchart, largely\nbecause of the unique challenges involved in each step. Multi-dimensional MHD models are\ntypically used to study the source and conversion of energy, but they provide little useful\ninformation on the response of the plasma and its radiation signatures. Conversely, 1D\nhydrodynamic models are typically used to study the plasma response, but they treat the heating in a\ngeneric manner, without regard to its physical origin. Both approaches are valuable, but it is\ndangerous to apply them in isolation without considering the big picture. An important goal of this\narticle is to encourage a more integrated approach to the coronal heating problem and to emphasize\nthe importance of all of the steps in the flowchart. Any missing or weak links can lead to a false\nsense of success.\nWe address each of the flowchart steps in the next five sections. Particular emphasis is\ngiven to energy conversion and plasma response, since these are in many ways the most\nchallenging. Several cross-cutting themes emerge: (1) highly disparate spatial scales, (2) physical\nconnections between the corona and lower atmosphere, (3) complex microphysics, and (4)\nvariability and dynamics. We then offer our personal view of the most promising explanation for\nhow the magnetically-closed corona is heated. It is essentially Parker's (1983, 1988) idea of\nnanoflares occurring in tangled magnetic fields, as elaborated upon recently by Priest, Heyvaerts,\nand Title (2002). We show that a mechanism called the secondary instability is likely to be\nresponsible for the impulsive energy release, and that impulsive heating is able to explain certain\nobserved properties of coronal loops that are otherwise difficult to understand. We close with a\nsummary and recommendations.\nThis article is not intended to be an exhaustive review of coronal heating. For such\ninformation, the reader is referred to G\u00f3mez (1990), Zirker (1993), Narain and Ulmschneider\n(1996), Mandrini, D\u00e9moulin, and Klimchuk (2000), Walsh and Ireland (2003), and Aschwanden\n(2004). We deal explicitly with the magnetically-closed corona, where field lines are rooted to the\nsolar surface at both ends. Some of the discussion may also apply to the magnetically-open solar\nwind, but there are many other important aspects of solar wind heating that we do not address. We\nalso do not address the heating of the chromosphere, which is an equally important problem. This\narticle stems from a keynote address given at the highly successful SOHO-15 Workshop on Coronal\nHeating that was held in St. Andrews, Scotland in the fall of 2004. An early version of the article\nappears in the proceedings (Klimchuk, 2004).\n\n\f3\n\n2. Energy Source\nThe combined radiative and conductive energy losses from the corona have a flux of roughly 107\nergs cm-2 s-1 in active regions and 3x105 erg cm-2 s-1 in the quiet Sun (Withbroe and Noyes, 1977).\nA basic requirement of any coronal heating theory is to identify an energy source that can sustain\nthese levels of losses. It is widely accepted that mechanical motions in and below the photosphere\nare the ultimate source of the energy. These motions displace the footpoints of coronal magnetic\nfield lines and either quasi-statically stress the field or generate waves depending on whether the\ntimescale of the motion is long or short compared to the end-to-end Alfv\u00e9n travel time. Dissipation\nof magnetic stresses is referred to as direct current (DC) heating, and dissipation of waves is\nreferred to as alternating current (AC) heating. We examine each of these in turn.\n2.1. DC HEATING\n\nFootpoint motions perform work on the coronal magnetic field and increase its free energy\nat a rate given by the Poynting flux through the base:\nF=-\n\n1\nBv Bh . Vh ,\n4\u03c0\n\n(1)\n\nwhere Bv and Bh are the vertical and horizontal components of the field and Vh is the (horizontal)\nfootpoint velocity. The energy of the field will also change if there is emergence or submergence of\nflux, but we do not consider those processes here.\nMost of the magnetic flux in the photosphere is concentrated in small tubes of kilogauss\nstrength (e.g., Solanki, 1993; Muller, 1994; Socas-Navarro and S\u00e1nchez Almeida, 2002;\nDom\u00ednguez Cerde\u00f1a, Kneer, and S\u00e1nchez Almeida, 2003). These flux tubes flare out in the\nchromosphere and transition region and become space filling in the corona where the plasma \u03b2 (=\n8\u03c0P/B2) is small. This occurs at very low altitudes within active regions and the quiet Sun network.\nWithin mixed polarity inter-network regions, a web of small loops forms a low-lying \"magnetic\ncarpet\" (Schrijver and Title, 2002). Most of the carpet loops do not penetrate into the corona (Close\net al., 2003), and \u03b2 may be of order unity within some of those that do (Schrijver and van\nBallegooijen, 2005). A fraction of the inter-network flux extends above the carpet and spreads out\nin the higher corona where \u03b2 is small. The quiet Sun coronal field is therefore a mixture of network\nfield and surviving inter-network field.\nTo evaluate Equation (1), it is convenient to take the base of the corona to be the lowest\naltitude where the expanding flux tubes have merged. Photospheric longitudinal magnetograms\nwith modest spatial resolution provide a good estimate of the vertical field strength at this altitude.\nThe signal measured near disk center is indicative of the net flux in an observational pixel and, for\ncoarse pixels, is insensitive to the small loops of the magnetic carpet. Observations give Bv flux\ndensities of typically 100 G in active region plage areas (Schrijver and Harvey, 1994) and 5-10 G in\nthe quiet Sun (4\" pixels; L\u00f3pez Fuentes, private communication).\nMagnetic flux tubes in the photosphere are displaced by turbulent convection and are\nobserved to wander about the surface with a characteristic velocity Vh of order 1.0x105 cm s-1\n(Muller et al., 1994; Berger and Title, 1996). We can assume that the tubes move with similar\nvelocities at the coronal base just above. Using these values in Equation (1) and assuming that Bh ~\nBv, we find that the Poynting flux into the corona is adequate to explain the observed energy losses\nof both the quiet Sun and active regions. There is no question that DC heating is viable from an\n\n\f4\nenergy source standpoint. Understanding how the magnetic stress energy is converted into heat is a\nmuch bigger challenge. We will return to Equation (1) in Section 3.3 to infer a fundamental\nproperty of the energy conversion process.\n2.2. AC HEATING\n\nThe energetic feasibility of AC heating is much less certain. The same turbulent convection that\nquasi-statically stresses the coronal field also generates a large flux of upwardly propagating waves.\nThese waves take on a variety of different forms: acoustic, Alfv\u00e9n, and fast and slow magnetosonic\nplane waves, as well as torsional, kink, and sausage magnetic flux tube waves (body and surface\nvarieties). Mode coupling and other processes transfer energy between the different wave types, so\nthe mix of waves changes as a function of height in the atmosphere (e.g., Stein and Nordlund, 1991;\nBogdan et al., 2003). Theoretical and observational estimates suggest energy fluxes at the top of\nthe convection zone of roughly several times 107 erg cm-2 s-1 (Narain and Ulmschneider, 1996).\nEnergy fluxes of this magnitude are more than adequate to heat the corona. However, only a\nsmall fraction of the flux is able to pass through the very steep density and temperature gradients\nthat exist in the chromosphere and transition region. Acoustic and slow-mode waves form shocks\nand are strongly damped, while fast-mode waves are strongly refracted and reflected (Narain and\nUlmschneider, 1996). Alfv\u00e9n waves, including the Alfv\u00e9n-like torsional and kink tube waves, are\nbest able to penetrate into the corona. They do not form shocks since they are transverse, and their\nenergy is ducted along the magnetic field rather than being refracted across it. Energy flux\nestimates for these waves are therefore especially important. Ulrich (1996) observed magnetic and\nvelocity fluctuations with the correct phase relationship for Alfv\u00e9n waves and inferred a flux of\n\u2264 107 erg cm-2 s-1 in regions of strong magnetic field. This is marginally adequate to heat active\nregions, but only if the transmission efficiency is near 100%. Muller et al. (1994) inferred a similar\nenergy flux for the quiet Sun from the observed \"shaking\" of photospheric flux tubes by granular\nmotions. Only a small fraction of this flux needs to reach the corona to heat the quiet Sun. On a\nnegative note, Parker (1991) has argued that solar convection should not be very efficient at\ngenerating Alfv\u00e9n waves (see also Collins, 1992).\nMost Alfv\u00e9n waves are strongly reflected in the chromosphere and transition region, where\nthe Alfv\u00e9n speed increases dramatically with height. Significant transmission is possible only\nwithin narrow frequency bands centered on discrete values where loop resonance conditions are\nsatisfied (Hollweg, 1981, 1984; Ionson, 1982). Hollweg (1985) estimates that enough flux may\npass through the base of long (> 1010 cm) active region loops to provide their heating, but shorter\nloops are a problem, since they have higher resonance frequencies and the photospheric power\nspectrum is believed to decrease exponentially with frequency in this range. Litwin and Rosner\n(1998) suggest that short loops may in fact transmit waves with low frequencies, as long as the field\nis sufficiently twisted.\nTransmission is not an issue for waves that are generated in the corona itself. Possible\nsources include magnetic reconnection (Moore et al., 1991; Yokoyama, 1998; Sturrock, 1999;\nLongcope, 2004) and loss of equilibrium (Longcope and Sudan, 1992). The energy for these waves\nfirst resides in the stressed coronal magnetic fields, so heating scenarios of this type have both AC\nand DC aspects. The ability of waves to heat regions that are remote from DC energy conversion\nsites could be very important. For example, one might imagine that magnetic reconnection\nproduces localized strong heating in a bright coronal loop and more distributed weak heating in the\nsurrounding diffuse corona.\nThe existence of waves in the corona is well established (e.g., Erd\u00e9lyi, Ballester, and Fleck,\n2004). For instance, traveling intensity perturbations observed in the legs of some loops provide\n\n\f5\nclear evidence for upwardly propagating acoustic waves (e.g., Berghmans and Clette, 1999; De\nMoortel et al., 2002). The real issue is whether coronal waves carry a sufficient energy flux to heat\nthe plasma. The spatially-resolved acoustic waves most certainly do not. Much larger energy\nfluxes may be present in unresolved wave motions. The observed non-thermal broadening of\ntransition region and coronal spectral lines implies fluxes that are sufficient to heat both the quiet\nSun and active regions, but it is completely unknown whether the waves are of the right type or the\nright frequency to be adequately damped (Porter, Klimchuk, and Sturrock, 1994). Furthermore, the\nnon-thermal line broadening could be produced by unresolved motions that are completely\nunrelated to waves, such as field-aligned flows that are driven by impulsive heating (e.g.,\nPatsourakos and Klimchuk, 2005b). Our lack of knowledge about the basic properties of coronal\nwaves (type, energy flux, and spectrum) is a major impediment to understanding AC coronal\nheating.\n\n3. Energy Conversion\n3.1. DISPARATE SPATIAL SCALES\nThe next step in the coronal heating flowchart is to identify a mechanism for converting the\nmagnetic stress energy or wave energy into heat. Because classical dissipation coefficients are\nextremely small in the corona, significant heating generally requires the formation of very steep\ngradients and very small spatial scales. Magnetic gradients and their associated electrical currents\nlead to heating by reconnection and Ohmic dissipation, while velocity gradients lead to heating by\nviscous dissipation.\nThere are a number of different ways to produce the necessary gradients. They can be\nformed through slow quasi-static evolution and through highly dynamical processes. Possible\nscenarios include: (1) simple photospheric flow patterns at the base of complex coronal magnetic\nfields containing separatrix surfaces, nulls, and separators (e.g., Karpen, Antiochos, and DeVore,\n1996; Longcope, 1996, 1998; Aly and Amari, 1997; Priest, Heyvaerts, and Title, 2002); (2)\ncomplex photospheric flow patterns with stagnation points at the base of simple coronal magnetic\nfields (e.g., van Ballegooijen, 1986; Galsgaard and Nordlund, 1996; Hendrix et al., 1996; Antiochos\nand Dahlburg, 1997); (3) instabilities, such as the kink instability brought about by a twisting flow\n(e.g., Hood and Priest, 1979; Lionello et al., 1998); (4) turbulence (e.g., Inverarity, Priest, and\nHeyvaerts, 1995; Einaudi et al., 1996; Dmitruk, G\u00f3mez, and DeLuca, 1998); and (5) loss of\nequilibrium, usually considered for flares and coronal mass ejections (e.g., Forbes and Isenberg,\n1991), but also relevant to coronal heating (Longcope and Sudan, 1992). For waves, we have the\nadditional processes of (6) resonance absorption (e.g., Ionson, 1978; Hollweg, 1984; Davila, 1987;\nPoedts, Goossens, and Kerner, 1989; Steinolfson and Davila, 1993), which we examine in more\ndetail in Section 4.3; and (7) phase mixing (e.g., Heyvaerts and Priest, 1983; Similon and Sudan,\n1989; Ofman and Aschwanden, 2002).\nAn important point is that all of these mechanisms for producing small-scale structure\ninvolve the large-scale magnetic field and its connection to the photosphere. The small scales\ndevelop either gradually or suddenly as the large-scale coronal field responds to slow motions at the\nlower boundary. Precisely how this occurs depends on the details of the field and the details of the\nmotions (although turbulence is rather generic). This poses a severe challenge for modeling energy\nconversion, since an enormous range of scales must be treated. To date, no study has been fully\nsuccessful. Some numerical simulations have accurately addressed the build up of stresses and the\nformation of current sheets, but the energy conversion is highly under-resolved and therefore\n\n\f6\nquestionable. Other simulations have attacked the details of the energy conversion with high\nresolution, but the existence and properties of a current sheet are simply assumed.\nIt is clear that a simultaneous treatment of all the important spatial scales requires a highly\nnon-uniform numerical mesh. The mesh must also be adaptive, since the locations where steep\ngradients will form are not generally known in advance. Even when the initial locations can be\nanticipated, they usually drift as the simulation proceeds. Mesh points must therefore be\ndynamically added in places where they are needed and removed in places where they are no longer\nnecessary. Techniques of this kind are now available and are beginning to produce impressive\nresults for certain classes of problems (e.g., Gombosi et al., 2004; Antiochos and DeVore, 2004).\nHowever, a number of challenges must still be overcome. More sophisticated algorithms for\nmodifying the mesh must be developed for problems in which many small-scale structures are\nscattered throughout the computational domain (e.g., turbulence). Existing algorithms tend to\nproduce a uniformly fine mesh in these situations, and the simulation grinds to a crawl. Another\nissue concerns the accuracy of the solution at the boundaries between sub-domains of differing\nmesh size. These problems are reasonably straightforward, and rapid progress can be expected in\nthe near future.\n3.2. MICROPHYSICS\nDetailed microphysics is likely to play an important role in the energy conversion process.\nAnomalously large (non-classical) transport coefficients may be required for significant heating,\neven in the presence of steep gradients. It was argued by Parker (1973) and subsequently verified\nwith numerical simulations by Biskamp (1993) and others that magnetic reconnection proceeds at\nthe fast Petschek rate only if the electrical resistivity is enhanced by 3 or more orders of magnitude.\nIn addition, the enhancement must be spatially localized and not spread over a large volume (see\nalso Kulsrud, 2001).\nThere have been several attempts to infer the values of coronal transport coefficients by\nstudying their effects on observed wave motions. Nakariakov et al. (1999) and Ofman and\nAschwanden (2002) concluded that the rapid damping of oscillating TRACE loops requires at least a\n5 order of magnitude enhancement in either the electrical resistivity or the shear viscosity (although\nHollweg, 1984, argued that loop oscillations may dampen quickly from energy leakage out the\nends). On the other hand, Klimchuk, Tanner, and DeMoortel (2004) found that classical thermal\nconduction is adequate to explain the damping of acoustic waves propagating along TRACE loops\nand ruled out the possibility that either thermal conduction or compressive viscosity are greatly\nenhanced. It may seem inconsistent that some transport coefficients would be anomalously\nenhanced while others not, but in fact this is not surprising. The magnetic field produces\ntremendous anisotropies in the particle transport, both for classical transport by collisions and\nanomalous transport by, for example, small-scale turbulence. Shear viscosity, which involves\ncross-field transport, is much more affected by turbulence than is field-aligned thermal conduction\n(Braginskii, 1965). Further quantitative study of these effects is needed.\nAnother microphysics issue concerns the collisionality of the plasma. Recent studies\nsuggest that collisionless effects may be extremely important for reconnection (e.g., Birn et al.\n2001; Bhattacharjee, 2004). The Hall term in the generalized Ohm's Law causes ions to decouple\nfrom the magnetic field whenever the current sheet is thinner than the ion skin depth, or ~ 103 cm in\nthe corona (Priest and Forbes, 2000, Table 1.2). For reasons that are not yet entirely clear, this\nallows reconnection to proceed at the Petschek rate even if the resistivity is everywhere small.\nConceptually, one can think of this in terms of a collisional plasma in which the resistivity is\nenhanced only at the sheet, thereby providing closure with the results of Parker and Biskamp cited\n\n\f7\nabove. It should be noted that collisionless reconnection studies have mostly been restricted to the\nneutral sheet configuration, which is a special type of current sheet that contains no guide field. It\nhas not yet been established that collisionless reconnection is rapid in the more general case where\nthe magnetic field rotates across the sheet, though very recent simulations suggest that it is (Drake\net al., 2005)\nHybrid codes that simulate both the MHD and particle aspects of the plasma are extremely\npowerful for investigating isolated coronal regions such as current sheets. However, they are\nlimited to studies of very small regions, and we have emphasized that the interplay between large\nand small spatial scales is critically important for understanding coronal heating (and most other\ninteresting coronal problems). Some modelers have argued that the details of the microphysics are\nunimportant, and that the artificial numerical resistivity of existing MHD codes captures the\nessential physical effects that determine how a coronal system will evolve. This may be a\nreasonable working hypothesis, given our present numerical limitations, but it is a dangerous\nposition to adopt as an unchallenged truth. Let us examine this point more closely.\nThe numerical resistivity of a finite-difference simulation with mesh size \u2206x and time step\n\u2206t can be expressed as\n\n\u03b7 num = f\n\n\u2206x\n\u2206t\n\n2\n\n,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere f is a dimensionless function of both the local flow speed and the ratio \u2206x/l, l being the local\nspatial scale of the magnetic field (C.R. DeVore, private communication). Note that \u03b7num has the\nsame units as physical resistivity, length-squared over time. The magnitude and precise form of f\nare algorithm dependent, but all modern, high-order algorithms have the generic property that f is\ngreatest where \u2206x/l is largest. It seems intuitively correct that numerical effects should be greatest\nwhere the gradients are most poorly resolved. Furthermore, algorithms without this property tend to\nbe unstable or produce solutions with unphysical oscillatory structure, so they are not generally\nused.\nThe point of this discussion is to show that numerical resistivity mimics the behavior of the\ncorona in at least a gross sense. For a given mesh size, the resistivity is small away from current\nsheets, where l is large, and it is large within current sheets, where l is small. However, is the\nsimilarity with the actual corona close enough? Can we be confident that differences do not\nfundamentally alter the outcome of a simulation? In our opinion, we do not yet have a clear answer.\nAt the very least, modelers should repeat their simulations with several different \u2206x to verify that\nthe results do not depend qualitatively on the numerical resolution (within the examined range).\nQuestions remain even then, since the Reynolds numbers attainable with the best MHD simulations\nare still many orders of magnitude smaller than solar values, and there is no guarantee that the\nresults can be scaled to realistic solar conditions. It is not far-fetched to imagine that the simulation\nis dominated by one process, but the real corona is dominated a completely different process that\ncannot be captured by the simulation. Our intent here is not to paint a pessimistic picture, but rather\nto remind readers that numerical results must be treated with an appropriate level of caution.\nOne way around this predicament is to incorporate realistic microphysics into MHD codes\nin some approximate manner. Heuristic, parameterized transport coefficients that account for nonclassical effects are one possibility. Several studies have already approximated the anomalous\nresistivity due to current-driven instabilities by making the resistivity depend on the ratio of the drift\nvelocity of the electric current to the thermal velocity of the particles (e.g., Ugai, 1999; Yokoyama\n\n\f8\nand Shibata, 2001; Uzdensky, 2003). Hoshino (1991) proposed a different form based on lower\nhybrid turbulence that depends on (\u2207B2)2. Heat flux saturation is another example where nonclassical microphysics can be incorporated into an MHD or hydro code (see Section 4.2). Further\nefforts along these lines are strongly encouraged.\n3.3. SWITCH-ON PROPERTY\n\nWe now return to Equation (1) to discuss a fundamental property of DC energy conversion.\nIn our earlier rough estimate of the Poynting flux through the coronal base, we casually assumed\nthat the horizontal and vertical components of the field have comparable magnitudes. Let us instead\nask what value of the horizontal component is necessary to make the Poynting flux equal to the\nobserved coronal loss rate. In Parker's picture, coronal flux tubes become tangled by random\nfootpoint motions associated with turbulent convection. As long as the random walk step size is\nlonger than the characteristic separation of nearby tubes, each displacement will bend a flux tube\naround its neighbor, and the lower part of the tube will always trail behind the moving footpoint1.\nIn that case, Bh and Vh will be approximately aligned, so that |Bh . Vh| \u2248 BhVh. Using typical\nobserved values for F, Bv, and Vh in the quiet Sun, Equation (1) implies that the field is tilted from\nvertical by arctan(Bh/Bv) \u2248 20o. Active region values give an angle closer to 10o, while Parker\n(1988) estimated an angle roughly in between these two. We do not wish to imply that these\ndeterminations are highly accurate, but it is clear that the tilt angle is neither very close to 0o nor\nvery close to 90o.\nThis deceptively simple result has a profound implication that has been largely overlooked.\nWhatever the mechanism of DC coronal heating, it must remain dormant long enough for magnetic\nstresses to build to the required level, i.e., long enough for the field to become sufficiently tilted,\nand then it must switch on suddenly to prevent the stresses from becoming too large. If the\nmechanism were to activate too early or too late, the corona would be cooler or hotter than\nobserved. It is interesting that quiet Sun and active region observations imply roughly the same\ncritical angle. This suggests a common heating mechanism. In Section 7, we equate the 20o tilt\nangle with a 40o misalignment angle between adjacent flux tubes in the tangled field. We show that\nthe secondary instability of electric current sheets switches on at approximately this value.\n\n4. Plasma Response\nWe now discuss how the plasma responds to heating produced by the dissipation of magnetic\nstresses or waves. This is extremely important for two reasons. First, the radiative signatures that\nare used to test any coronal heating theory depend critically on the state of the plasma. Second, the\nresponse of the plasma can in some cases greatly affect the subsequent heating.\n4.1. CONNECTION TO THE LOWER ATMOSPHERE\nA fundamental aspect of the plasma response is the close thermal and dynamic connection\nbetween the corona and lower atmosphere. This is true for both equilibrium and time-dependent\nconditions. In the case of static equilibrium, thermal conduction transports somewhat more than\n1\n\nMore precisely, the random walk step size must be longer than the correlation length of the flow, since tubes moving\ntogether in a group can wrap around other groups but not each other.\n\n\f9\nhalf of the coronal heating energy down to the transition region, where it is more efficiently radiated\nat the higher densities and cooler temperatures (e.g., Vesecky, Antiochos, and Underwood, 1979).\nSome studies have erroneously treated the corona in isolation, using rather arbitrary heat flux\nboundary conditions at a location somewhere above the transition region. This is extremely\ndangerous. Many coronal solutions to the equilibrium equations are unphysical in the sense that\nthere does not exist a matching solution for the transition region. The pressure and heat flux must\nbe the same at the top of the transition region and bottom of the corona, where the two solutions\nmeet. The problem is that, in equilibrium, the pressure of the transition region is determined by the\nheat flux, and this pressure may be different from the coronal pressure, creating an inconsistency. It\nis vitally important that the corona and transition region be treated together as a coupled system.\nThe critical role of the lower atmosphere is even more apparent when the heating is time\ndependent. An increase in the heating rate causes the coronal temperature to rise, producing an\nincrease of the downward heat flux. The transition region is unable to radiate the additional energy,\nso heated plasma flows into the corona through the process known as \"chromospheric evaporation.\"\nThe upflow can be quite explosive and even produce shocks if the change in the heating rate is\nsufficiently intense and abrupt. If the heating rate then decreases, an inverse-like process occurs in\nwhich plasma drains from the loop and \"condenses\" back onto the chromosphere. This is generally\nmore gradual and proceeds on the slower radiative cooling timescale.\nBecause the plasma and magnetic field are frozen together, and because cross-field thermal\nconduction is greatly inhibited, it is customary to use 1D hydro simulations to study the plasma\nresponse to variations in coronal heating. Simulations of this type, often referred to as \"loop\nmodels,\" assume that the magnetic field is rigid and plays only a passive role by channelling the\nplasma and thermal energy along the field lines. The advantage of this approach is that highly\ncomplex field-aligned behavior can be accurately simulated using a full energy equation. The\ndisadvantage is that the heating must be specified and cannot be computed self-consistently.\nSkeptics have complained that 1D hydro models are of limited value since, for DC heating, the\nenergy conversion necessarily involves changes in the magnetic field that are not included. This\ncriticism is largely over-exaggerated. One can think of the magnetic field as being comprised of\nmany small flux strands, or mini loops, each one thinner than the kilogauss photospheric flux tubes\ndiscussed earlier. The field is indeed modified as magnetic energy is converted into heat, but once a\nnew flux strand is formed---from reconnection, for example---its subsequent motion and change in\nshape have relatively little impact on the evolution of the plasma contained within. The plasma\nevolution is also independent of how the plasma is evolving in neighboring strands. 1D hydro\nmodels are therefore entirely appropriate for investigating the plasma behavior of individual\nstrands.\nThere is one important caveat, however. This claim is valid only for strands that maintain\ntheir integrity for periods longer than a cooling time. Depending on the situation, additional\nreconnections at other locations along the strand may cause it to exchange sections with several\ndifferent partners, thereby mixing the plasmas and impacting how the plasma evolves. Another key\npoint is that an observed coronal structure, such as an X-ray or EUV loop, is comprised of many\nstrands that may be heated very differently or at very different times. In this case, each strand must\nbe simulated separately. Computing a single loop model using the average heating for the different\nstrands will produce an entirely incorrect result.\nEventually, 1D hydro models will be completely supplanted by 3D MHD models that\naccurately treat both the energy conversion and the plasma response. However, until the 3D models\nincorporate field-aligned thermal conduction and properly resolve the transition region, 1D models\nwill continue to play an important role. We cannot emphasize strongly enough that both the\ntemperature and density of the corona are greatly affected by the heat flux into and through the\n\n\f10\ntransition region. Furthermore, the transition region is an important layer to study in its own right.\nIt radiates more than half of the energy deposited in the corona, making it a useful diagnostic of\ncoronal heating (Antiochos et al., 2000) and an important source of UV input to the terrestrial upper\natmosphere (Lean, 1997).\nSome existing MHD models do include field-aligned thermal conduction (e.g., Lionello,\nLinker, and Miki\u0107, 2001; Yokoyama and Shibata, 2001; Gudiksen and Nordlund, 2002, 2005a,b),\nbut they do not yet adequately resolve the transition region. To understand the resolution\nrequirements, we can estimate the temperature scale length at temperature T in the transition region\nto be\n7/2\n\n7\u239b T \u239e\nHT \u2248 2 \u239c \u239f\n\u239dTm \u23a0\n\nL ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere Tm and L are the maximum coronal temperature and half length of the loop strand (more\nprecisely, L is the distance along the strand between the chromosphere and the position of\nmaximum temperature). This simple result is derived using HT = T/|dT/ds|, Fc = -\u03ba0T5/2dT/ds = (2/7)\u03ba0d(T7/2)/ds, and assuming that the heat flux is roughly constant in the middle and upper\ntransition region and given by Fc \u2248 -(2/7)\u03ba0Tm7/2/L. For T/Tm = 0.1 and L = 5x109 cm, Equation (3)\ngives HT \u2248 5x106 cm. We have verified that this is a reasonable approximation for an exact\nequilibrium solution with Tm = 2 MK (T = 0.2 MK). To resolve this temperature scale length\nrequires a mesh spacing of 20 kilometers or less. The requirements are even more severe at greater\ndepths in the transition region and for hotter and shorter strands. Not resolving the transition region\ncan produce errors of a factor of 2 or more in the coronal density and 4 or more in the predicted\nradiation (S. Patsourakos, private communication).\nThe difficulties are compounded when the heating is variable, because then the transition\nregion moves up and down the strand in response to the changing coronal pressure. For highly\nimpulsive heating, the vertical displacement is approximately\n\u239b2 e \u239e\n\u2206z \u2248 \u2212 H g ln \u239c\n\u239f ,\n\u239d3 P\u23a0\n\n(4)\n\nwhere Hg is the gravitational scale height of the chromosphere, e is the strand-averaged energy per\nunit volume of the heating event, and P is the pre-event pressure at the top of the chromosphere. In\nthe simulation we show below, the transition region moves by approximately 4 scale heights, or\n7x108 cm for our model chromospheric temperature of 3x104 K. It is clear that adaptive mesh\nrefinement is required to properly model dynamic conditions. To further emphasize this point, we\nnote that moving transition regions can form at locations other than the base of the loop, such as at\nthe sides of coronal condensations (e.g, Karpen et al., 2001; Karpen, Antiochos, and Klimchuk,\n2005; Mueller, Hansteen, and Peter, 2003). Propagating shocks may also be present in many\nsituations.\n4.2. IMPULSIVE HEATING\nAs discussed above, it is imperative to treat individual magnetic flux strands in order to understand\nhow the plasma responds to heating. We define a strand to be a mini-loop for which the heating and\nplasma properties are approximately uniform on a cross section. From this perspective, we find that\n\n\f11\nmost coronal heating theories predict that the heating is impulsive in nature. Petschek-type\nmagnetic reconnection is a good example. Individual strands are heated only while they are in\ncontact with standing slow shocks that emanate from the reconnection X-point. A newly\nreconnected strand snaps away from the X-point at the Alfv\u00e9n speed, so the heat pulse in the strand\nlasts a few tens of seconds at most (e.g., a 2x109 cm long shock and 2x108 cm s-1 Alfv\u00e9n speed give\na pulse of 10 s). Even if the reconnection is steady and persists unchanged for long periods, it is the\nheating of individual strands that matters, and this is very short lived. Resonant wave absorption is\nanother example of heating that is usually thought of as steady, but in fact is highly impulsive when\nlooked at from the proper perspective (see below).\nLoop models with impulsive heating are therefore especially relevant (e.g., Reale et al.,\n2000; Warren, Winebarger, and Hamilton, 2002; Klimchuk, 2002). We now discuss the results of\none such simulation in some detail (Klimchuk, Patsourakos, and Winebarger, 2003). It was\nperformed with our state-of-the-art hydro code, ARGOS, that uses adaptive mesh refinement\n(Antiochos et al. 1999). An important new feature is the inclusion of heat flux saturation. The\nmodel strand consists of a semi-circular coronal section of length 1.5x1010 cm with long\nchromospheric sections attached to both ends. We start with an initial static equilibrium that is\nmaintained at a peak temperature of only 0.5 MK by a weak uniform heating of 1.0x10-6 erg cm-3 s1\n. We then rapidly increase and decrease the heating by a factor of 1500 using a triangular profile\nlasting 500 s. The heat pulse is spatially uniform and corresponds to a 2x1024 erg nanoflare for a\nstrand cross-sectional radius of 107 cm.\nFigure 2 shows the resulting evolution of temperature, density, and velocity averaged over\nthe central 80% of the coronal section. The generic response to impulsive heating is well known\n(e.g., Cargill 1994). The spatially-averaged temperature rises rapidly to a maximum of about 8 MK\nnear the peak of the energy release. An intense heat flux drives strong chromospheric evaporation\nwith upflow velocities reaching 3x107 cm s-1. The initial cooling is quite rapid and is dominated by\nthermal conduction. Material continues to evaporate into the loop during this phase. As\ntemperature falls and density rises, radiation becomes progressively more important. Eventually,\nafter about 1500 s, it takes over as the primary cooling mechanism. The strand then enters a long\nperiod of relatively slow cooling and mild condensation, when temperature and density decrease\ntogether. It is during this second phase that most of the emission is produced. The small wiggles in\nthe curves of Figure 2 are due to waves that are excited by the impulsive heating and propagate\nback and forth along the strand with diminishing amplitude.\nDespite the strong evaporation, this model does not predict that easily detected blue-shifted\nemission would be observed in most spectral lines. The reason is that the highest speed upflows are\nboth short lived and faint. They have very high temperatures and very low densities and emission\nmeasures. For most spectral lines, the temporally averaged emission from the strand (or the\nspatially averaged emission from a bundle of randomly heated strands) is dominated by the much\nslower draining phase. Only small Doppler shifts are predicted, consistent with observations\n(Warren and Doschek, 2005; Patsourakos and Klimchuk, 2005b). Very hot emission lines are an\nexception. They are relatively insensitive to the low temperatures of the draining phase, and if they\nare \"tuned\" to the temperature of the explosive upflow, they can exhibit distinctive blue-wing\nenhancements (Patsourakos and Klimchuk, 2005b). These features may be detectable by future\nspectrometers like the one that will fly on Solar-B, though the lines will be quite faint and long\nintegration times may be required.\nFigure 3 shows the instantaneous state of the strand at time t = 220 s, roughly halfway into\nthe energy release. Temperature and density are plotted as a function of position, s, along the\nstrand. The top of the chromosphere is located at positions s = 5x109 and 2.2x1010 cm in the left\nand right legs, respectively. These positions are depressed relative to the initial positions, as\n\n\f12\ndiscussed in the previous section. The solid and dashed curves represent two separate simulations\nthat differ only in the way thermal conduction is treated. For the dashed curves, the well-known\nSpitzer-Harm formula for classical thermal conduction is used at all times:\nFc = \u2212 \u03ba 0T\n\n5/ 2\n\n\u2202T\n,\n\u2202s\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u03ba0 = 10-6 in cgs units. This formula is appropriate under most conditions. However, early in\nthe simulation, when the densities are low and the temperatures are high, it predicts a greater heat\nflux than is physically possible. The real heat flux saturates at a magnitude given by\nFs = c\n\n3 k3/ 2\nnT 3/ 2 ,\n2 m1e / 2\n\n(6)\n\nwhere n is the electron number density, k is Boltzmann's constant, me is the electron mass, and c is a\nflux limiter constant that we set to 1/6 (Luciani, Mora, and Virmont 1983; Karpen and DeVore\n1987). The simulation represented by the solid curves properly accounts for heat flux saturation.\nThis is the same simulation shown in Figure 2. The plasma response is strikingly different in the\ntwo simulations. Much higher temperatures are reached when the heat flux is saturated because\nmore of the energy is bottled up in the central portion of the strand. These large differences do not\npersist for long, however. Only the hottest spectral lines are expected to be significantly affected,\nbut these are precisely the lines that are most useful for diagnosing impulsive heating.\nThus far, we have resisted using the term \"nanoflare\" to describe impulsive heating in a loop\nstrand, because many people think of a nanoflare as an identifiable event in a distinguishable solar\nfeature, such as a transient X-ray brightening (e.g., Shimizu, 1995). Such an event would require\nmany strands of the type we have discussed. In the subsequent discussion, a nanoflare refers simply\nto an impulsive energy release in a single, probably unresolvable, strand.\nA very important variable is the frequency with which nanoflares recur in a given strand.\nThe properties of the plasma depend sensitively on whether the time interval between successive\nevents is long or short compared to a cooling time (Kopp and Poletto, 1993; Walsh, Bell, and Hood,\n1997; Mendoza-Briceno, Erd\u00e9lyi, and Sigalotti, 2002; Testa, Peres, and Reale, 2005). The greater\nthe time lag, the more the strand deviates from equilibrium. When nanoflares repeat very rapidly,\nthe situation is effectively the same as steady heating, and the strand persists in a quasi-equilibrium\nstate. Another important variable is the rate at which individual nanoflares turn on and off (Reale et\nal., 2000; Spadaro et al., 2003). The more slowly the heating rate changes, the more closely the\nbehavior resembles quasi-static evolution.\n4.3. RESONANT WAVE ABSORPTION\nMost heating mechanisms are not significantly affected by the plasma response, but resonant wave\nabsorption is one important exception where a critical feedback occurs. As pointed out in Section\n2.2, substantial wave energy can enter through the base of a loop only at discrete frequencies.\nThese are the natural resonance frequencies of the loop, and the oscillations that are excited are\ncalled global modes, or collective modes, because all of the magnetic strands oscillate together in a\nkink-like fashion. Despite oscillating in unison, each strand has a preferred resonance frequency\nthat depends on the local density through the Alfv\u00e9n speed:\n\n\f13\n\n\u03c9 res \u221d\n\nV A \u221d \u22121 / 2 ,\nn\nL\n\n(7)\n\nwhere we have made use of the fact that the magnetic field strength is nearly constant over the cross\nsection of a low-\u03b2 loop. If density varies over the cross section, only some of the strands will be in\ntune with the global oscillation. Energy from the global motions is preferentially pumped into these\nstrands, and they experience large-amplitude torsional oscillations. Steep velocity and magnetic\ngradients develop between these and nearby out-of-tune strands, and the plasma is heated in narrow\nresonance layers.\nNearly all of the theoretical work on resonant wave absorption begins with an assumed\ndensity profile, n(r), describing the variation of density with radial distance away from the loop\naxis. A typical example is shown by the dashed curve in Figure 4a, where the density peaks at the\naxis and monotonically decreases to an external value. This density profile is assumed to be\nconstant in time. Driver motions are applied, either at or near the global mode frequency or with a\nbroad frequency spectrum. Collective oscillations are set up at the fundamental frequency and\nperhaps also some harmonics. One or more resonance layers develop at fixed radial positions, and\nthe loop reaches a steady state with constant, non-uniform heating (e.g., Poedts, Goossens, and\nKerner, 1989; Steinolfson and Davila, 1993; Ofman, Davila, and Steinolfson, 1994; Erd\u00e9lyi and\nGoossens, 1995; De Groof and Goossens, 2002). The solid curve in Figure 4a is a schematic\nrepresentation of the heating profile corresponding to a single resonance layer.\nUnfortunately, there is a fundamental inconsistency with this picture. We have already seen\nthat strong heating leads to large coronal densities through evaporation, while weak heating leads to\nsmall coronal densities through condensation. The original density profile will not remain constant,\nas assumed. Instead, it will evolve to a profile roughly resembling the heating profile, as\nrepresented by the dashed curve in Figure 4b (artificially broadened for clarity). This will change\nthe resonance conditions, and different strands will come in tune with the global oscillations. The\nold resonance layer will shut off and two new ones will activate, as indicated by the solid curve in\nFigure 4b. This new heating profile will lead to a new density profile, which will in turn lead to a\nnew heating profile, etc. We quickly see that resonant wave heating is an inherently dynamic\nprocess. No steady equilibrium is possible.\nWe have verified this scenario with an MHD simulation in a slab geometry that mimics a\ncoronal loop (Ofman, Klimchuk, and Davila, 1998). Chromospheric evaporation and condensation\nare treated only approximately using a quasi-static equilibrium scaling law to update the density in\nresponse to the computed heating:\nn (r ) \u221d Q (r )5 / 7 ,\n\n(8)\n\nwhere Q(r) is the volumetric heating rate. Instead of one stationary resonance layer, there are\nmultiple layers that drift back and forth throughout the loop. A key point is that, even though the\nspatially averaged heating rate is approximately constant, the different strands that make up the loop\nare heated impulsively as resonance layers pass by. This is one more example, like Petschek\nreconnection, where seemingly steady heating is actually impulsive when looked at from the proper\nperspective. Future work on resonant wave heating must incorporate the important feedback\nbetween the energy release and plasma response.\nWe quickly remark that the global loop oscillations discussed above are primarily of a kink\nnature and are excited by translational driver motions. Energy can transfer into the torsional\noscillations at the resonance layers because the global modes have both kink and torsional\n\n\f14\ncomponents (e.g., Davila, 1987). Torsional driver motions are also possible, but they tend to\nproduce heating by the different process of phase mixing. In that case, the different cylindrical\nshells of the loop oscillate independently of each other and extract power from the driver at\ndifferent preferred frequencies. There is no collective behavior. Steep gradients develop even if\nadjacent shells oscillate with similar amplitude, because the oscillations are out of phase.\n\n5. Radiation\nThe next step in the coronal heating flowchart is to determine the radiation spectrum emitted by the\nheated plasma. This is relatively straightforward if the plasma is in a state of ionization\nequilibrium, because then powerful atomic physics software packages such as CHIANTI (Dere et\nal. 1997) can be used. The emissivity of the plasma in a particular spectral line is given by ne2G(T),\nwhere G(T) depends on atomic physics parameters and is unique to each spectral line. Since the\ncoronal plasma is optically thin, one simply integrates the emissivity along the line-of-sight to\ndetermine the intensity of the radiation. Synthetic spectral line profiles can be constructed by\nassuming a Gaussian at each line-of-sight position that is broadened according to the local\ntemperature and Doppler shifted according to the local velocity. Uncertainties are quite large,\nhowever, due to uncertainties in the ionization rates, recombination rates, etc. that go into G(T).\nFactors of two are not uncommon (Savin and Laming 2002). Elemental abundances are also\nproblematic. Absolute abundances are difficult to measure, and relative abundances are known to\nvary with time and from one solar feature to the next (e.g., Feldman and Widing, 2003).\nIt is much more complicated to determine the radiation spectrum when the plasma is not in\nionization equilibrium. This is likely to be the case if there is rapid evolution due to impulsive\nheating or rapid cooling (e.g., Raymond, 1990), or if there is a flow through a steep temperature\ngradient (e.g., Roussel-Dupree, 1980). The determining factor is whether the timescale for\ntemperature change in a plasma parcel is short or long compared to the ionization or recombination\ntime, whichever is relevant. Consider an observation of the simulation in Figure 3 with the 193 \u00c5\nline of Ca XVII, which is formed at 5 MK under equilibrium conditions. This is one of the lines\nthat will be observed by the Extreme-ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) on Solar-B. Because\nthe densities are so low at this early stage of the simulation, the ionization equilibration time at the\nmidpoint of the strand is roughly 104 s (Mazzotta et al., 1998). Temperature is increasing with a\nmuch shorter timescale, so the ionization lags behind.\nIn situations like this when ionization equilibrium does not apply, it is necessary to solve the\nionization rate equations in order to accurately determine the radiation spectrum (e.g., Mariska et\nal., 1982; Spadaro, Leto, and Antiochos, 1994; Sarro et al., 1999; Bradshaw and Mason, 2003a,b;\nMueller, Hansteen, and Peter, 2003). Fortunately, this can usually be done as a secondary step,\nafter the hydrodynamic or MHD simulation has been completed. The reason is that nonequilibrium\neffects tend to have minimal impact on the spectrum-integrated radiation loss rate and therefore do\nnot significantly modify the plasma evolution (although see Spadaro et al., 1990).\nOther microphysics effects that can alter the radiation signature include the thermal force,\nwhich is important in regions of steep temperature gradient (e.g., Woods and Holzer, 1991), and\nambipolar diffusion of neutral atoms relative to charged species, which is important at interfaces\nwith chromospheric plasma, either at the base of loops or at the boundaries of prominences and\ncoronal condensations (e.g., Fontenla, Avrett, and Loeser, 1990, 1991). Non-local heat transport\nassociated with electrons in the high-energy tail of the particle distribution can also be important\n(e.g., Karpen and DeVore, 1987). Scudder (1992) has even proposed that the coronal plasma is\nessentially derived from suprathermal particles from the transition region. If this were the case,\n\n\f15\nhowever, we would not expect the corona to be so different in the quiet Sun and coronal holes, since\nthe transition region is quite similar in these regions (S. Antiochos, private communication).\n\n6. Observables\nThe last step in the coronal heating flowchart is to predict observables that can be compared directly\nwith real solar data. As sophisticated as solar instruments are, they only detect bits and pieces of\nthe emitted spectrum, and often with a large degree of averaging over space, time, and wavelength.\nThis can be a great source of ambiguity and confusion, and care must be taken not to misinterpret\nthe observations or to present legitimate interpretations as unique when in fact they are not. The\nambiguities are most apparent when one realizes that the plasma observed in a single observational\npixel may be highly nonuniform in both temperature and density. Sub-resolution structures are both\ntheoretically predicted and observationally inferred (e.g., Orrall et al., 1990; Brosius, Davila, and\nThomas, 1996; Schmelz 2002). Furthermore, any line-of-sight path through the optically-thin\ncorona can cross multiple large-scale structures with different properties.\nIt is common to use inversion methods to infer physical quantities such as temperature,\nemission measure, density, and filling factor. The approach can be quite useful, even when the\nobserved plasma is nonuniform, but the quantities must be appropriately interpreted as weighted\naverages (Klimchuk and Cargill, 2001). Problems arise when the spectral information is severely\nlimited, such as when the filter ratio technique is used. The ratio of intensities observed through\ntwo filters implies a temperature, but that temperature has clear meaning only if the plasma is\nknown to be isothermal. There are many examples of TRACE observations where the addition of a\nthird filter reveals that the plasma is actually multi-thermal with a broad temperature distribution\n(Noglik, Walsh, and Ireland, 2004, 2005; Patsourakos and Klimchuk, 2005c). The pitfalls of the\nfilter ratio technique have been well documented (Reale and Peres, 2000; Martens, Cirtain, and\nSchmelz, 2002; Schmelz et al., 2003; Weber et al. 2005), although see Aschwanden (2002).\nForward modeling is the safest way to compare theory and observation. With this approach,\na simulated observation (e.g., the intensity of a spectral line or in a passband) is derived from a\nmodel and compared with real data. The parameters of the model are varied until, hopefully, a\nsatisfactory fit is achieved. Forward modeling must be used whenever ionization nonequilibrium\napplies.\n\n7. Tangled Fields, Secondary Instability, and Nanoflares\nWe now combine some of the ideas we have already introduced and discuss what we believe to be\nthe most promising explanation of coronal heating. We start with Parker's (1983, 1988) picture of\ntangled magnetic fields. The kilogauss photospheric flux tubes that are randomly shuffled by\nturbulent convection contain only about 1017 Mx of flux (e.g., Solanki, 1993; Muller, 1994; SocasNavarro and S\u00e1nchez Almeida 2002). Many tens to hundreds of them must therefore be bundled\ntogether within a single coronal loop observed by TRACE or Yohkoh (e.g., Priest, Heyvaerts, and\nTitle, 2002). These elemental tubes become wrapped and braided by the footpoint motions, and\ncurrent sheets form at the interfaces where the tubes are misaligned. Parker suggested that energy is\nreleased impulsively as nanoflares when the stresses and currents become too large.\nAs we pointed out in Section 3.3, energy balance considerations indicate that the field at the\ncoronal base is tilted from vertical by approximately 20o. If we associate this with tangling, it\nequates to a critical misalignment angle of 40o. For many years there was no physical explanation\n\n\f16\nfor why nanoflares should switch on at this particular value, but we have recently identified a\nmechanism called the secondary instability that has precisely this property (Dahlburg, Klimchuk,\nand Antiochos, 2003, 2005). It is a rapidly growing instability that sets in after the primary\ninstability, the well-known tearing mode, saturates at a low level. As the secondary instability\nbecomes nonlinear, it transitions to turbulence and produces intense, impulsive heating. Figure 5\nshows the combined resistive and viscous heating rate as a function of time from one of our 3D\nMHD simulations. The event lasts about 100 s and would release approximately 1024--1025 ergs of\nenergy in a current sheet of realistic size. Note that this duration and energy are similar to what we\nassumed for the nanoflare hydro simulation presented in Section 4.2. Impulsive heating of this type\nis able to explain important properties of many observed coronal loops that cannot be understood\nwith steady heating, as we now explain.\n7.1. OVER AND UNDER DENSITIES\nA large majority of warm (T ~ 1 MK) coronal loops observed by TRACE and EIT are over dense\ncompared to what is expected for static equilibrium (Aschwanden et al., 1999; Aschwanden,\nSchrijver, and Alexander, 2001; Winebarger, Warren, and Mariska, 2003) or steady flow\nequilibrium (Patsourakos, Klimchuk, and MacNeice (2004). The discrepancy is reduced, but not\neliminated, if the heating is assumed to be concentrated near the loop footpoints. In contrast, hot (T\n> 2 MK) loops observed by Yohkoh are under dense compared to static equilibrium (Porter and\nKlimchuk, 1995). Loops of intermediate temperature observed by the SXI instrument on GOES-12\nhave about the right density (L\u00f3pez Fuentes, Mandrini, and Klimchuk, 2004). This may indicate\nthree physically distinct classes of loops, perhaps heated in completely different ways, but there is\nanother possibility that unifies the results into a single picture.\nThe over and under densities are related to the ratio of the radiative to conductive cooling\ntimes:\n7/2\n\n\u03c4 rad =\n2.9x10 \u2212 7 2 T2\n\u03c4 cond\nn L \u039b T\n\n()\n\n,\n\n(9)\n\nwhere \u039b(T) is the optically-thin radiative loss function. Radiation and thermal conduction losses\nare comparable in equilibrium loops (Vesecky, Antiochos, and Underwood, 1979), and therefore the\ncooling time ratio should be close to unity for loops that are near equilibrium. Figure 6 shows the\nactual ratios computed for a collection of 56 different loops observed by either Yohkoh or TRACE\nand plotted against the observed temperature (Klimchuk, Patsourakos, and Winebarger, 2003). The\ntemperatures and emission measures were determined using filter ratios, and then the densities were\ndetermined using the observed loop widths assuming a circular cross section (Klimchuk, 2000) and\na filling factor of one. Notice that the hot loops lie above the horizontal line log(\u03c4rad/\u03c4cond) = 0,\nindicating that thermal conduction dominates over radiation, and the warm loops lie below the line,\nindicating that radiation dominates over thermal conduction. This is precisely what would be\nexpected if the loops were cooling after having been impulsively heated to very high temperatures\n(Section 4.2). The points can be lowered by assuming filling factors less than one, so the hot loops\ncan be made to be consistent with static equilibrium, but the warm loops would then become even\nmore discrepant.\n\n\f17\nThe curve in Figure 6 shows the cooling track of a nanoflare simulation similar to the one\npresented in Figures 2 and 3. In this case, the nanoflare is 7 times more energetic and is repeated\nevery 5000 s. Under these circumstances, the density at the beginning of each event is about 4x108\ncm-3. The track begins at the top-right, at the time of maximum temperature, and progresses\ndownward and to the left. The agreement between the simulation and observations is remarkably\ngood. One is tempted to conclude that the simulation is representative of all 56 loops, and that the\nloops look different simply because they are observed at different phases in the cooling. This\nsimple interpretation is not correct, however. Yohkoh, TRACE, and SXI/GOES loops are observed\nto evolve much more slowly than the simulation would predict, i.e., they are observed to live much\nlonger than a cooling time (Porter and Klimchuk, 1995; Winebarger, Warren, and Seaton, 2003;\nL\u00f3pez Fuentes, Mandrini, and Klimchuk, 2004). The loops cannot be monolithic structures cooling\nas whole units. Rather, each loop must be a bundle of unresolved strands that are heated at different\ntimes. The loop will then appear to evolve slowly even though the individual strands evolve\nrapidly. Yohkoh preferentially detects the hottest strands that are in the early, conductiondominated phase of cooling, and TRACE preferentially detects the warm strands that are in the late,\nradiation-dominated phase.\nThe two diamonds in Figure 6 indicate synthetic Yohkhoh and TRACE observations obtained\nfrom the time-averaged emission from the entire nanoflare simulation. This is equivalent to an\ninstantaneous snapshot of a bundle of identical strands in random stages of cooling. The diamonds\nlie well within the band of real data points, demonstrating that our explanation is at least plausible.\nThe fact that the data points form a band, rather than two tight clusters around the diamonds,\nsuggests that real nanoflares have a range of energies. This is not surprising, given the wide range\nof magnetic field strengths that exist in the corona.\nThe basic picture of multi-stranded, impulsively heated loops is certainly not new. It was\nfirst put forward by Cargill (1994) and has subsequently been studied in considerable detail (e.g.,\nCargill and Klimchuk 1997, 2004; Vekstein and Katsukawa, 2000; Klimchuk and Cargill 2001;\nWarren, Winebarger, and Hamilton 2002; Warren, Winebarger, and Mariska 2003, Patsourakos and\nKlimchuk 2005a,b). The model is extremely appealing in its ability to tie together a number of\ndifferent observations and concepts. Significant issues remain, however. The biggest concern is\nthat the model predicts that loops should be visible either simultaneously or nearly simultaneously\nover a broad range of temperatures. In particular, a loop should be detectable by both Yohkoh and\nTRACE at the same location, either at the same time or with a slight delay. How often this is\nactually the case has been actively debated (e.g., Nitta, 2000; Schmelz et al., 2001; Schmelz, 2002;\nDelZanna and Mason, 2003; Nagata et al., 2003; Landi and Landini, 2004; Schmieder et al., 2004;\nAschwanden and Nightingale, 2005; Aschwanden, 2005; Reale and Ciaravella, 2005; Schmelz and\nMartens, 2005). Some have argued that hot and warm loops occur preferentially in different parts\nof active regions and therefore tend to be mutually exclusive. Others suggest that hot and warm\nloops are located near each other, but do not actually overlap. Still others have presented examples\nof loops that can be clearly seen in a variety of spectral lines, though with a spatial resolution that is\nless than ideal.\nCases have recently been reported where a loop is first seen by Yohkoh and later seen by\nTRACE, sometimes with a temporal overlap (Winebarger and Warren, 2005; Ugarte-Urra,\nWinebarger, and Warren, 2005). This suggests that a \"storm\" of nanoflares has occurred over a\nlimited time window. We emphasize that a single large nanoflare can be ruled out, because the\nloops live considerably longer than a cooling time, irrespective of the observing instrument.\nPreliminary indications are that the delay between when the loop is first seen by Yohkoh and first\nseen by TRACE is longer than predicted by cooling strand models (~2000 and 3000 s in the\n\n\f18\nsimulations presented here). Further study is necessary to determine just how serious this problem\nis.\nThe issue of cospatial hot and warm loops can be avoided if nanoflares recur frequently\nwithin each strand. Repetition times much shorter than a cooling time produce quasi-static\nequilibrium conditions. Larger events and higher frequencies maintain hot strands, while smaller\nevents and lower frequencies maintain warm strands. The hot and warm strands need not be\nintermingled. If all of the nanoflares within a loop bundle have a similar magnitude and recur with\na similar frequency, then the loop will be approximately isothermal. The drawback of this picture is\nthat it is unable to explain the observed under densities of Yohkoh loops and over densities of\nTRACE loops. The under densities can be corrected by assuming a small filling factor (Porter and\nKlimchuk, 1995), but the over densities present a fundamental observational challenge.\nRegardless of the temporal nature of the heating, we can ask how thick the basic isothermal\nstrands are. This provides vital information on the cross-field scale of the energy release. Note that\nthe concept of an isothermal strand is just a convenience, since temperature most likely has a\ncontinuous variation across the magnetic field. We define a strand to be a flux tube that is\napproximately isothermal over a cross section. Aschwanden and Nightingale (2005) and\nAschwanden (2005) have argued that some of the thinnest loops seen by TRACE are isothermal\nstrands. However, only 14% of their thin-loop data could be fitted with an isothermal model to\nwithin a rather generous reduced-\u03c72 of 1.5 (a reduced-\u03c72 fit of 1.5 means there is only a 13%\nprobability that the model is correct). The remaining 86% of the data have even larger reduced-\u03c72\nvalues and are clearly inconsistent with the isothermal model. We conclude that a large majority of\nstrands are thinner than and perhaps much thinner than 2x108 cm. Whether the strands that are seen\ntogether as a multi-thermal loop are closely spaced and physically related or simply a chance\nalignment of structures that are widely separated along the line-of-sight is currently being\ninvestigated.\nA majority of coronal emission comes from a diffuse component rather than distinct coronal\nloops. TRACE loops, for example, are only about 10-20% brighter than the background. Is the\ndiffuse emission produced by steady heating, as proposed by Antiochos et al. (2003), or is it also\nproduced by unresolved, impulsively-heated strands? We have investigated the diffuse emission\nfrom one active region observed by TRACE and find that it is consistent with the latter picture. The\nintensity of moss regions, corresponding to the opposite polarity footpoints of a magnetic arcade,\nand the intensity of the inter-moss region, corresponding to the top of the arcade, have the correct\nrelative magnitudes for impulsively-heated strands. This is suggestive but not definitive. The longignored diffuse corona is very important and deserves much more attention in the future.\n7.2. CORONAL RECONNECTION\nThe premise that turbulent convection shuffles the footpoints of coronal flux tubes leads us to\nimportant conclusions about coronal heating. These conclusions are based solely on the evolution\nof the magnetic field and do not depend on the plasma response or the requirement that heating\nproduce the observed coronal densities, temperatures, etc. The first conclusion is that magnetic\nreconnection must be occurring at significant altitudes in the corona, above the magnetic carpet.\nReconnection is here broadly defined to be any process that changes the connectivity of the field,\nincluding the secondary instability. The justification for our conclusion is straightforward. Since\nrandom footpoint motions act to increase the tangling of the field, some other process must act to\ndecrease it. Otherwise, the tangling would grow indefinitely, magnetic stresses would build to\nridiculous levels, and no coherent structures such as coronal loops would exist.\n\n\f19\nReconnection is the only process that can disentangle the field2. It unhooks flux tubes that\nhave become entwined. A crucial point is that both of the reconnecting flux tubes must extend\nabove the magnetic carpet (above about 5x108 cm; Close et al., 2003). Reconnection between a\nlong coronal flux tube and a short carpet loop actually increases the coronal tangling (Schrijver et\nal. 1998). Such a reconnection effectively causes the footpoint of the long tube to jump\ndiscontinuously from one end of the short loop to the other. Since the carpet fields are\ndisorganized, this produces a random walk in much the same way that turbulent convection\nproduces a random walk. Reconnection involving carpet fields may be an important source of\nheating in the chromosphere (Schrijver, 2005), in low-lying cool (T < 0.2 MK) loops (Antiochos\nand Noci, 1986; Feldman, Widing, and Warren, 1999, 2000; Peter, 2001), and in the lower legs of\nwarm and hot loops (Aschwanden, Schrijver, and Alexander, 2001), but higher altitude\nreconnection must play an important, if not dominant, role in heating the corona. This statement is\nespecially true of active regions, where little mixed polarity field exists and the carpet is greatly\ndiminished.\nAnother conclusion we can draw is that the reconnection process that disentangles the field\nis likely to include a significant amount of resistive dissipation. This is because footpoint shuffling\nincreases the helicity of the field together with the tangling. According to Taylor's (1974) wellestablished hypothesis, processes that are essentially ideal (non-resistive) can eliminate the tangling,\nbut not the helicity. When two entwined flux tubes reconnect by Petschek reconnection, the mutual\nhelicity of their interlinking is converted into self helicity of internal twist. This twist helicity must\neventually be eliminated. In principle, two tubes with opposite twist can interact and their helicities\nwill cancel. However, tubes with opposite twist and like polarity (having axial fields pointed in the\nsame general direction) are not prone to interact (Linton, Dahlburg, and Antiochos, 2001; case RL0\nin their notation). Tubes with opposite twist and opposite polarity (case RL4) can more readily\ninteract, but they are not expected to come into contact very often. Helicity can also be removed\nfrom the corona by the submergence or ejection of flux. Submergence may be important in the\nmagnetic carpet, and ejection may be important at the peripheries of streamers or in major events\nlike coronal mass ejections, but whether these processes are important for most coronal flux tubes is\nunclear. It is possible that much of the helicity introduced by random footpoint shuffling is\neliminated by a process that involves substantial resistive dissipation (S. Antiochos, private\ncommunication; although see Berger, 1984). Taylor's hypothesis does not apply in that case. The\nsecondary instability is especially appealing in this regard because strong resistive dissipation is\nexpected to occur when the instability transitions to a highly turbulent state.\n7.3. CORONAL LOOP SYMMETRY\nThe tangling of elemental flux tubes may have important implications for the overall\ngeometry of coronal loops in addition to their internal structure (L\u00f3pez Fuentes, Klimchuk, and\nD\u00e9moulin, 2005). Coronal loops are observed to be symmetric in the sense that the two legs have\ncomparable thickness. The symmetry is much greater than predicted by standard magnetic field\nextrapolation models. However, due to limitations in the models and the magnetograms on which\nthey are based, the extrapolations do not include the small-scale structure associated with magnetic\nfield tangling. We suggest that this is a critical missing ingredient and propose that a combination\nof footpoint shuffling and coronal reconnection can explain the observed loop symmetry.\n2\n\nSome random walk steps will temporarily disentangle the field, but the net effect of multiple steps is to increase the\nlevel of tangling.\n\n\f20\nTo justify our conjecture, we first point out that asymmetric loops are a natural consequence\nof organized photospheric shear flows. Figure 7a is a simple example of a sheared arcade in which\nall of the field lines lie in vertical planes at 45o angles to the neutral line (dashed). The flow field\nthat produces this arcade has the form Vy \u221d x, where x=0 is the neutral line, as is indicated by the\nvelocity vectors at the bottom of the figure. We can define a loop (a large flux tube) within this\narcade by specifying a circular cross section at the photosphere on the left side of the neutral line.\nThis specification is made after the flow has sheared the field. The field lines originating in the\ncircle define the loop volume. They map to a distorted oval on the opposite side of the neutral line.\nIt is clear that the cross section is highly variable along the loop and that the loop would appear\nhighly asymmetric when viewed from most angles3. Note that the many elemental flux tubes that\nwe imagine to be contained in the loop are perfectly aligned with their neighbors.\nNow suppose that small-scale random motions are superposed on the large-scale shear flow\nand that the random motions have greater velocity, as typically observed. Starting with the\nunsheared arcade, it is clear that the field will become progressively more tangled as its shear is\nincreased. The tangling can only proceed so far, however, before the secondary instability switches\non and causes elemental flux tubes to reconnect with their neighbors. We expect that a fundamental\nconsequence of these reconnections is that no two flux tubes can have footpoints that are close\ntogether at one end, but far apart at the other end. Such a situation would require a high degree of\ntangling and very large misalignment angles (the misalignment angle scales with the path length of\nthe random walk in the photosphere). If we are correct, then a compact loop cross section on one\nside must map to a compact loop cross section on the other side. In particular, a circle cannot map\nto a highly distorted oval as in Figure 7a, but instead must map to an irregular patch as in Figure 7b.\nThe resulting loop would be roughly symmetric.\nA key point is that magnetic reconnection changes the connectivity of the field. Magnetic\nfootpoints, as would be viewed in a magnetogram movie, continue to wander farther and farther\napart as time progresses, but the way in which these footpoints are connected to each other is altered\nwith each reconnection event. Consider the three elemental flux tubes (field lines) in Figure 7.\nFootpoints A, B, and C map to A1, B1, and C1 in case (a), without random shuffling, but they map to\nA2, B2, and C2 in case (b), with random shuffling. The flux tubes in (b) have undergone multiple\nreconnections with other flux tubes not shown. They are drawn as wavy lines to indicate that the\nfield is tangled. The different locations of A2, B2, and C2 relative to A1, B1, and C1 are due\nprimarily to these reconnections and not (directly) to the footpoint shuffling.\n7.4. SCALING LAWS\nWe end this section by mentioning a series of coronal heating studies that make use of theoretical\nscaling laws that relate either the volumetric heating rate or the input energy flux to parameters such\nas the field strength and length of coronal flux tubes. Different heating theories make different\npredictions about the form of the scaling (Mandrini, D\u00e9moulin, and Klimchuk, 2000). By\ndetermining which scaling best reproduces the observations, it is possible to test the theories. This\napproach has been applied to individual coronal loops (Klimchuk and Porter, 1995; Mandrini,\nD\u00e9moulin, and Klimchuk, 2000), active regions (Fisher et al., 1998; D\u00e9moulin et al., 2003; Yashiro\nand Shibata, 2001; Lundquist et al., 2004; Mok et al., 2005; Warren and Winebarger, 2005),\nstreamers (Foley et al., 2002), the global Sun (Schrijver et al., 2004), and even other stars (Schrijver\nand Aschwanden, 2002; Pevtsov et al., 2003). The results favor DC heating over AC heating, but\n3\n\nHad we specified the circular cross section before the shear was applied, the final loop would have oval footpoints\ninclined by 45o angles on both sides of the neutral line, and the loop would be symmetric.\n\n\f21\nthey are unable to clearly discriminate among several competing DC theories. The picture of\ntangled magnetic fields and a critical misalignment angle (model 2 in Mandrini et al.) predicts a\nvolumetric heating rate that varies as B2L-1Vh and has mixed support. A different version of tangled\nfield heating (Parker, 1983; models 4 and 5 in Mandrini et al.) might better reproduce some of the\nobservations, but the heating rate depends on the flux tube diameter, which is typically ignored in\nthe studies even though the diameter may depend on L or B and therefore change the predicted\nscaling.\nStudies of this type are useful, but it must be recognized that many of the scaling laws are\nbased on plausible conceptual ideas rather than fully developed theories. Often they do not address\nthe specifics of the energy release, including whether the heating is impulsive or steady. A\npotentially serious shortcoming is that most of the observational comparisons assume that the\nplasma is in static equilibrium. We have discussed how the observed over density of warm loops is\nbest explained by impulsive heating and nonequilibrium cooling. We suggest that an incorrect\nassumption of static equilibrium is the reason why models of active regions and the global corona\ndo an especially poor job of reproducing TRACE and EIT images. Including impulsive heating in\nthese models is an important area of future research.\n8. Summary and Recommendations\nIn this article, we have tried to demonstrate how extremely challenging the coronal heating problem\nis and to emphasize that multiple steps must be accomplished in order to arrive at a definitive\nsolution. In working our way through the coronal heating flowchart, we discovered several\nimportant themes. We found that highly disparate and coupled spatial scales are involved, both\nalong and across the magnetic field. Small-scale features of particular significance include current\nsheets, transition regions, resonance layers, and shocks. We also found that physical connections\nbetween the corona and lower atmosphere are fundamentally important and affect both the source\nand conversion of energy and the response of the plasma to heating. The properties of the coronal\nmagnetic field, including its energy content, current sheets, and instability, are determined by\nevolving photospheric boundary conditions. The properties of the coronal plasma, including its\ntemperature, density, and radiation signatures, are greatly influenced by the heat flux to the base and\nthe associated transfer of mass via chromospheric evaporation and condensation. We identified\nseveral microphysics effects that can play critical roles in the coronal heating problem, such as nonclassical particle transport, collisionless reconnection, heat flux saturation, and ionization\nnonequilibrium. And finally, we showed that most coronal heating mechanisms are impulsive from\nthe perspective of elemental magnetic flux strands, and therefore that variability and dynamics are\nlikely to be very important. It is extremely compelling that both MHD simulations of energy\nconversion and hydrodynamic simulations of plasma response independently point to the same\nconclusion---that coronal loops are bundles of unresolved, impulsively heated strands.\nMany authors use the term \"nanoflare\" to describe a heating event that, by itself, produces a\nresolvable feature in a soft X-ray or EUV image. We advocate a much broader definition that\nincludes unresolved strands, and we note that a 1024 erg energy release---the canonical nanoflare--must occur once every second in a TRACE loop in order to satisfy the heating requirements.\nStudies of isolated point-like brightenings are interesting, but they may have limited relevance for\nordinary coronal heating. Furthermore, attempts to estimate the energy content of such events are\nfraught with uncertainties, and it is not possible to draw firm conclusions about the importance of\nnanoflares based on extrapolated power-law distributions of the number of events versus event\nenergy (Parnell, 2004).\n\n\f22\nWhere do we go from here? First of all, it is time start bridging the gap between MHD\ntreatments of the energy conversion and hydrodynamic treatments of the plasma response. This\nrecommendation applies both to the way we think about the coronal heating problem and to the way\nwe devise our simulations. One approach that we are planning at the Naval Research Lab is to use\nthe heating rates output from MHD simulations (e.g., Figure 5) as direct input to loop hydro\nsimulations (e.g., Figures 2 and 3). Walsh and Galtier (2000) have already used this approach. This\nmust be done with great care, however, because it cannot be assumed that the average heating rate\nfor the entire MHD domain applies equally to the many flux strands that make up the large-scale\nmagnetic structure (e.g., the loop).\nUltimately, we must solve the full problem with a massive MHD calculation that properly\naccounts for all of the important physical effects. Such a \"grand challenge simulation\" is many\nyears off, but it is reasonable to start taking initial steps in this direction. We applaud the ambitious\nwork of Gudiksen and Nordlund (2002, 2005a,b). Although their simulations do not adequately\nresolve current sheets, transition regions, etc.---and therefore must be treated with great caution--they are the closest thing yet to a realistic first-principles model of an active region (see also\nYokoyama and Shibata, 2001).\nSolving the coronal heating problem will also require improved observations. Our lack of\ndiscussion on this point should not be taken to imply a lack of importance. Because the corona is\nstructured on very small scales, existing observations are often ambiguous and sometimes\nmisleading (e.g., Section 6). We should not fault the experimenters for this, since it is no less\ndifficult to make a perfect observation than it is to perform a perfect numerical simulation. Tradeoffs must always be made when designing new instrumentation. In our opinion, the coronal heating\nproblem does not require observations with large fields of view. An active region size is desirable\nto allow the observation of entire loops, but significant progress could be made even with a smaller\nfield of view. High temporal resolution and rapid cadence can probably also be sacrificed, if\nnecessary (see below). The greatest emphasis should be placed on high spatial resolution, broad\ntemperature coverage, and high temperature fidelity (ability to discriminate different temperatures).\nExisting observations lack one or more of these properties. TRACE has high spatial resolution, but\nlimited temperature coverage and dubious temperature fidelity. Yohkoh has better temperature\ncoverage, but minimal temperature fidelity. The spectrometers on SOHO have good temperature\ncoverage and fidelity, but lack spatial and temporal resolution.\nThere is reason to hope that future imagers, like that proposed for the Reconnection and\nMicroscale (RAM) mission, will be able to resolve some of the important small-scale structures that\nhave so far eluded us. For example, if a loop of diameter d contains N elemental strands at different\ntemperatures, the spatial resolution required to discriminate the strands is roughly d/N1/2. A\nresolution of 107 cm may be adequate for strands that correspond to observed kG photospheric flux\ntubes. However, there would be considerable confusion from line-of-sight overlap effects if many\nof the strands have similar temperatures. This demonstrates that it may be strategically wise to look\nfor plasma structures that are expected to be the least prevalent (e.g., the hottest strands that\npresumably persist for the shortest periods of time).\nEven if there is reasonable hope of resolving kG flux tubes, we must remember that the\nsmall spatial scale of coronal heating is likely to produce elemental strands that are much thinner\nyet (e.g., at the current sheet interfaces between the kG tubes). Lacking the ability to resolve these\nstrands, we must rely on spectroscopy to sort out the properties of the multi-thermal plasma. A\nhigh-speed imaging spectrometer is therefore a top priority. It should observe many emission lines\nthat fully sample the temperature range from about 0.5 MK to 10 MK. The high end of the\ntemperature range is especially important for diagnosing impulsive heating, since relatively little\ncan be learned about the energy release (duration, spatial distribution along the field, etc.) once the\n\n\f23\nplasma enters the slow radiative cooling phase (Winebarger and Warren, 2004, 2005; Patsourakos\nand Klimchuk, 2005a,b). Since the evolution of individual strands will not be observable if they are\nunresolved, there is no need for an extremely rapid cadence. An image set every 100 s, or even\nlonger, may be acceptable. The Extreme-ultraviolet Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) that will fly on\nSolar-B has several of the properties we advocate, although its temperature coverage is not as\ncomplete as one would like. The proposed Normal Incidence Extreme UV Imaging Spectrometer\n(NEXUS) mission and the VEry high angular Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (VERIS) sounding\nrocket experiment could fill some of the temperature gaps, as could a spectrometer that will\npresumably fly on Solar Orbiter.\nClearly, much work is left to be done, both theoretically and observationally. If we\napproach the coronal heating problem wisely, we can look forward to a very exciting and\nproductive future!\n\nAcknowledgements\nThis work was supported by NASA and the Office of Naval Research.

Spatially-averaged temperature, density, and velocity versus time for a loop strand that\nhas been impulsively heated by a 500 s nanoflare. The averages are computed over the central 80%\nof the coronal section of the strand. Heat flux saturation is included.\nFigure 3. Temperature and density versus position along the strand at time t = 220 s, roughly\nhalfway into the impulsive energy release. The solid and dashed curves are for simulations with\nand without heat flux saturation, respectively.\nFigure 4. Schematic representation of resonant wave absorption. Density (dashed) and heating rate\n(solid) versus radial distance from the loop axis. Panel (a) corresponds to an initial time, and panel\n(b) corresponds to a subsequent time, as discussed in the text.\nFigure 5. Combined resisitive and viscous heating rate versus time for a secondary instability\nsimulation in which the magnetic field rotates by 90o across the current sheet (after Dahlburg,\nKlimchuk, and Antiochos, 2005).\nFigure 6. Ratio of radiative to conductive cooling times versus temperature for 56 different loops\nobserved by either Yohkoh or TRACE (crosses). Solid curve shows the cooling track of a nanoflare\nsimulation. Diamonds show synthetic observations based on the time-average of the simulation\n(Yohkoh observation at logT = 6.55; TRACE observation at logT = 6.09).\n\n\f29\n\nFigure 7. View from above of a coronal loop (a large magnetic flux tube) embedded in a\ntranslationally symmetric magnetic arcade. The arcade has been sheared by imposing anti-parallel\nboundary motions (arrows) on either side of the neutral line (dashed). The footpoint cross sections\nand three field lines, or elemental flux strands, are shown. The loop is defined by the circular cross\nsection on the left, which is specified after the shear is applied. Panel (a) assumes that only the\nsystematic shear flow is present, while panel (b) assumes an additional random component of flow\nand coronal reconnection.\n\n\f30\n\nFigure 1.
