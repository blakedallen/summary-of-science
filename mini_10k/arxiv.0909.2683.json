INTRODUCTION\n\n2. POWER ANISOTROPY AND WAVEVECTOR\n\nPlasma turbulence is observed to be anisotropic with respect to the magnetic field direction. For example, in the solar\nwind, the observed power and scaling of turbulent fluctuations\nvary depending on the angle between the local mean field\nand the sampling direction (Bieber et al. 1996; Horbury et al.\n2008; Podesta 2009; Osman & Horbury 2009). Correlation functions have also been observed to be anisotropic in\nthe solar wind (Crooker et al. 1982; Matthaeus et al. 1990;\nOsman & Horbury 2007; Weygand et al. 2009) and laboratory\nmeasurements (Robinson & Rusbridge 1971; Zweben et al.\n1979).\nRecent theories of plasma turbulence assume anisotropy\n(Goldreich & Sridhar 1995; Boldyrev 2006; Galtier 2006;\nLithwick et al. 2007; Gogoberidze 2007; Chandran 2008;\nBeresnyak & Lazarian 2008; Podesta & Bhattacharjee 2009;\nSchekochihin et al. 2009) and anisotropic energy transfer has been seen in simulations (Shebalin et al. 1983;\nCho & Vishniac 2000; Maron & Goldreich 2001; Cho et al.\n2002; Cho & Lazarian 2004, 2009). The theories usually describe the anisotropy in terms of the fluctuation wavenumbers\nparallel and perpendicular to the mean magnetic field direction, kk and k\u22a5 . For example, Goldreich & Sridhar (1995)\n2/3\nused the \"critical balance\" assumption to obtain kk \u223c k\u22a5 for\nmagnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence and, more generally, theories often assume k\u22a5 \u226b kk . In the solar wind, however, it is the anisotropy in power at a fixed scale that is\noften measured for practical reasons, rather than the spatial\nanisotropy of the fluctuations.\nIn Section 2, the relationship between power anisotropy and\nwavevector anisotropy is derived. A critically balanced model\nis then presented in Section 3 to illustrate that a break point\nin an anisotropic spectrum may occur at different scales when\nthe reduced spectrum is observed in different directions. The\nimplications of these two sections for recent solar wind measurements are discussed in Section 4.\n\nANISOTROPY\nThe correlation function of a turbulent field, for example, the magnetic field, B, can be defined as C(x) =\nhB(r + x) * B(r)i, where the angular brackets denote an ensemble average over positions r. The three-dimensional energy\nspectrum can then be defined\nR as the Fourier transform of the\ncorrelation function, E(k) = C(k)e\u2212ik*x d 3 x.\nA single spacecraft in the solar wind measures the turbulent field as a function of time, B(t). Since the solar wind\nvelocity, vsw , is much larger than the wave speed (often taken\nas the Alfv\u00e9n speed in the inertial range), Taylor's hypothesis (Taylor 1938) is usually well satisfied, meaning that the\nmeasured time variations correspond to spatial fluctuations\nin the plasma, \u2206x = \u2212vsw \u2206t. Because a single spacecraft\ngives a one-dimensional cut through the plasma, the full threedimensional spectrum cannot be measured but instead a reduced version is obtained (FredricksR & Coroniti 1976). This\nreduced spectrum, defined as P(k) = E(k\u2032 )\u03b4(k \u2212 k\u2032 * v\u0302sw )d 3 k\u2032 ,\nwhere v\u0302sw is the solar wind direction unit vector, is the threedimensional spectrum integrated over the directions perpendicular to the measuring direction. Assuming axisymmetry\nabout the magnetic field, this reduced power spectrum also\ndepends on the angle, \u03b8, of the field to the one-dimensional\nmeasurement direction, P(k, \u03b8). In Cartesian coordinates, this\ncan be written as a dependence on the parallel and perpendicular wavenumbers, P(kk , k\u22a5 ).\nFigure 1 is a schematic of reduced power contours with respect to the parallel and perpendicular wavenumbers. Power\nanisotropy is usually measured at a fixed scale, indicated by\nthe red dashed line which is at a fixed radius from the origin. At different points along this line, a different reduced\npower is sampled; this effect is readily seen in the solar\nwind (Bieber et al. 1996; Horbury et al. 2008; Podesta 2009;\nOsman & Horbury 2009). A relationship between power\nanisotropy and wavevector anisotropy will now be derived.\nNote that the derivation does not depend on any particular\ncontour shape; the elliptical shapes in the figure are for illus-\n\n\fCHEN ET AL.\n\nPerpendicular Wavenumber, k\u22a5\n\n2\n\nally assumed that second-order statistics, such as power, relate to these quantities, for example Cho & Vishniac (2000)\nstate that in their simulations, contours of second-order structure functions \"reflect the shapes of the eddies.\" Under this\nassumption, the wavevector anisotropy of power contours can\nbe thought to describe \"typical\" wavevector anisotropy of the\nfluctuations.\n\nk\u22a5 2\n\nk\u22a5 1\n\n3.

Power anisotropy measurements are made at a\nfixed scale (dashed red line).\n\ntrative purposes only.\nLet us consider two contours of size (kk1 , k\u22a51 ) and\n(kk2 , k\u22a52 ) such that kk2 = k\u22a51 (Figure 1). We will assume that\npower anisotropy is being measured at this wavenumber, k =\nkk2 = k\u22a51 . Let reduced power in the parallel and perpendicular directions be defined as Pk = P(kk , 0) and P\u22a5 = P(0, k\u22a5 ),\nand \u03b1 be the scaling exponent in the perpendicular direction,\n\u2212\u03b1\nP\u22a5 \u223c k\u22a5\n.

Substituting these\ninto Equation (1) gives\n\u0013\u03b1\n\u0012\nk\u22a52\nP\u22a51\n.\n(2)\n=\nPk2\nkk2\nSince P\u22a51 /Pk2 is just the power anisotropy at fixed wavenumber k (as in solar wind measurements), the numeric subscripts\nmay be dropped. Rearranging Equation (2) we get\n\u0012 \u0013 \u0012 \u0013 \u03b11\nk\u22a5\nP\u22a5\n=\n.\n(3)\nkk 2\nPk\nThis relationship is independent of the scaling of the parallel\nspectrum and allows us to calculate the wavevector anisotropy\nof contour 2 from a measurement of P\u22a5 /Pk . A similar relationship can be derived for contour 1,\n\u0012 \u0013 \u0012 \u0013 \u03b21\nP\u22a5\nk\u22a5\n,\n(4)\n=\nkk 1\nPk\nwhere \u03b2 is the scaling exponent of the parallel reduced spectrum, Pk \u223c kk\u2212\u03b2 . Although it is possible to infer the wavevector anisotropy from the interpolation of measurements such as\nFigure 1 of Horbury et al. (2008), the relationship given here\nallows it to be found from the power anisotropy, a quantity\nmore easily measurable in the solar wind.\nThe k\u22a5 and kk of turbulence theories usually describe typical length scales associated with the fluctuations. It is usu-\n\nPOWER SPECTRUM\nThe \"critical balance\" assumption states that in a turbulent\nAlfv\u00e9n wave (AW) cascade, the linear wave timescale and the\nnonlinear energy transfer timescale are comparable. It was\nintroduced explicitly by Goldreich & Sridhar (1995) and anticipated in the work of Higdon (1984). When applied to\ninertial range MHD turbulence, the spectral index of the reduced spectrum in the perpendicular direction is \u22125/3 and the\n2/3\nwavevector scaling is kk \u223c k\u22a5 . A reduced spectral index of\n\u22122 in the parallel direction follows from these statements.\nThere is evidence in the solar wind inertial range\nfor both the Alfv\u00e9nic nature of the turbulence (e.g.\nBelcher & Davis 1971; Horbury et al. 1995; Bale et al. 2005)\nand the anisotropic scaling (Horbury et al. 2008). It appears that this scaling is only detectable when observing with respect to the scale-dependent local mean magnetic field (e.g. Cho & Vishniac 2000; Horbury et al. 2008;\nBeresnyak & Lazarian 2009), i.e., the mean field at the scale\nof each fluctuation being measured, rather than a global\nlarge-scale average field. Although MHD is a fluid theory,\nSchekochihin et al. (2009) have shown that reduced MHD,\nan anisotropic limit of MHD containing the Alfv\u00e9nic fluctuations, can be derived for a collisionless plasma at scales larger\nthan the ion gyroradius. This may explain why the MHD scalings are seen in the collisionless solar wind.\nAt scales smaller than the ion gyroradius, commonly\ntermed the \"dissipation range,\" there is evidence for kinetic Alfv\u00e9n waves (KAWs) (Bale et al. 2005; Sahraoui et al.\n2009). These are linear modes of electron reduced MHD, an\nanisotropic theory derived for collisionless plasmas at scales\nbetween the electron and ion gyroradii (Schekochihin et al.\n2009). When the critical balance assumption is applied to a\n1/3\nKAW cascade, the wavevector scaling becomes kk \u223c k\u22a5 and\nthe predicted spectral indices for the magnetic field are \u22127/3\nin the perpendicular direction and \u22125 in the parallel direction\n(Cho & Lazarian 2004; Schekochihin et al. 2009).\nIn this theoretical framework, the break between the inertial range and the dissipation range is predicted to be at\nk\u22a5 \u03c1i \u223c 1, where \u03c1i is the ion gyroradius, but if the fluctuations here are anisotropic then their parallel length should be\nlarger, kk \u03c1i < 1. This would imply that the observed break\npoints in solar wind measurements are at different spacecraft\nfrequencies for the reduced spectra in the parallel and perpendicular directions. A similar effect would be expected at the\nelectron break scale, k\u22a5 \u03c1e \u223c 1, where the difference in break\nfrequency between the spectra in the parallel and perpendicular directions may be even greater if the anisotropy continues\nto increase throughout the dissipation range.\nSince the observed break points would be at different scales\nfor spectra in the parallel and perpendicular directions, a\nschematic of the reduced spectra can be divided into five\nranges (Figure 2).

Predictions for fluctuations smaller than\nthe electron scale do exist but have not been included here.\nGyrokinetic theory predicts scalings for an electron-entropy\ncascade, valid for k\u22a5 \u03c1e \u226b 1 (Schekochihin et al. 2009), however it has been suggested that it is not applicable to the solar\nwind in this range (Howes et al. 2008). In Figure 2, the (logarithm of the) power anisotropy can be thought of as the vertical distance between the spectra and the (logarithm of the)\nwavevector anisotropy as the horizontal distance.\nThe scalings for each of the ranges in Figure 2 are given in\nTable 1. Also listed is the scaling of P\u22a5 /Pk , which follows\ndirectly from that of P\u22a5 and Pk and is shown in Figure 3.\nIn the inertial range P\u22a5 /Pk scales as k1/3 which steepens to\nk10/3 when Pk reaches the ion break scale and then becomes\nshallower at k8/3 when P\u22a5 reaches the ion break scale.\nThe width of thep\nKAW range in the P\u22a5 spectrum is predicted to be \u03c1i /\u03c1e = Ti mi /Te me , where mi and me are the ion\nand electron masses, and for the model spectra in Figures 2\nand 3 the temperatures have been assumed equal, Ti = Te . Although Ti /Te is of order unity in the solar wind, there is some\nvariation (Bruno & Carbone 2005) so the extent of the possible KAW range may vary. The width of each of the ranges\nin Figures 2 and 3 also depends on the amount of anisotropy\npresent. For example, as the anisotropy at the ion break scale\nincreases, the size of range 2 increases but the size of range\n\nFigure 3. Schematic of reduced power anisotropy as a function of scale for\ncritically balanced AW and KAW turbulence.\n\n3 decreases. It may even be the case that if the anisotropy\nis very strong at the ion break scale then range 3 may not be\npresent at all, meaning it would not be possible to measure\nKAW scaling in P\u22a5 and Pk at the same frequency.\nOne of the assumptions used when constructing these\nmodel spectra was that they contain no additional energy injection or loss. As noted in Schekochihin et al. (2009), at\nthe ion break scale some energy may be transferred from the\nAlfv\u00e9nic cascade channel to a purely electrostatic \"entropy\ncascade.\" The amount of energy transferred, if any, is unknown so cannot be included in our model spectra here. It\nis also possible that power may be injected into the cascades\nfrom other sources such as plasma instabilities, for example,\nthe firehose and mirror instabilities, which evidence suggests\nmay be important in the solar wind (Bale et al. 2009). Including effects such as these in this model is beyond the scope of\nthis Letter.\nIt should also be noted that only the Alfv\u00e9nic part of the cascade in the inertial range is dealt with here. This is relevant\nto the solar wind, which is primarily Alfv\u00e9nic in nature (e.g.\nBelcher & Davis 1971; Bale et al. 2005; Bruno & Carbone\n2005) and in which any compressive (non-Alfv\u00e9nic) fluctuations are, on theoretical grounds, not thought to interfere with the Alfv\u00e9nic cascade (Cho & Lazarian 2003;\nSchekochihin et al. 2009).\n4. COMPARISON TO SOLAR WIND MEASUREMENTS\n\nThe only published measurement of the variation of power\nanisotropy, P\u22a5 /Pk , in the solar wind across both inertial and\ndissipation ranges, which we are aware of, is in the lower\npanel of Figure 7 of Podesta (2009). The scaling arguments\nin Section 2 can be applied to these measurements to obtain\nestimates of the wavevector anisotropy at various scales. For\nexample, at the high-frequency end of the inertial range, at\n\u2248 0.2 Hz, P\u22a5 /Pk \u2248 7 which, using \u03b1 = 5/3 in Equation (3),\nmeans k\u22a5 /kk \u2248 3. A value of \u03b1 = 5/3 was used for this calculation since it is the prediction of critical balance MHD turbulence (Goldreich & Sridhar 1995) and is close to the measured value of 1.65 for this data interval (Podesta 2009). In\ngeneral, break points in spectra seem to have a rollover rather\nthan a clean break in scaling so this result is approximate. It\nis also possible that since Pk is measured in the bin 0 \u2013 6\u25e6 and\n\n\f4\n\nCHEN ET AL.\n\nnot at exactly 0\u25e6 , values of P\u22a5 /Pk and therefore k\u22a5 /kk may\nbe underestimates. The value obtained here, k\u22a5 /kk \u2248 3, was\nused to set the anisotropy at the ion break scale in Figures 2\nand 3.\nFigure 3 of this Letter can be compared to Figure 7 of\nPodesta (2009) in which the frequency corresponding to k\u03c1i =\n1 is \u2248 0.5 Hz. In the inertial range, both graphs have a shallow slope with the measurement steeper than the prediction,\nalthough the uncertainties in the measured slope may be significant as discussed in Podesta (2009). Between 0.4 Hz and\n1.0 Hz, the measured power anisotropy increases with a steep\nslope. The scales at which this happens approximately correspond to ranges 2 and 3 in Figure 3. It may be the case, therefore, that the steep slope of P\u22a5 /Pk seen in dissipation range\nsolar wind measurements is due to critical balance scaling, in\nparticular the steep scaling of the KAW Pk spectrum.\nOne difference between the figures is that the decrease in\npower anisotropy between 0.2 Hz and 0.4 Hz in the measurement is not present in Figure 3. As discussed in Podesta\n(2009), this is caused by an increase in the parallel power\nand may be due to parallel waves, for example, from plasma\ninstabilities. For frequencies above 1.0 Hz the measured\nanisotropy decreases, which is due to the flattening of the Pk\nspectrum. The scale at which this begins (1.0 Hz) is close\nto the predicted electron break scale for the Pk spectrum, although without knowing the electron gyroradius, the exact location of this is not clear. One possibility, therefore, is that the\ncause of this decrease in P\u22a5 /Pk may be due to the Pk spectrum flattening above the electron break scale. Another possibility is that the cyclotron resonance may have been reached\nhere, causing a change in behavior (Howes et al. 2008). At\nthese high frequencies, however, measurement effects, such\nas magnetometer noise, may be important and one must be\ncautious when drawing any conclusions from this range.\nExtrapolating the model spectra to larger scales, it can\nbe seen from Figures 2 and 3 that power (and wavevector)\nisotropy is reached at k\u03c1i \u2248 10\u22123 . This corresponds to a\nlength around 106 km or an observed spacecraft frequency\nof 5 \u00d7 10\u22124 Hz. This is close to the observed break between the low-frequency f \u22121 power law and the inertial range\n(e.g. Bavassano et al. 1982; Bruno & Carbone 2005) and also\nthe solar wind correlation length (e.g. Matthaeus & Goldstein\n1982), scales usually associated with the outer scale of the\nturbulence.\nThe solar wind spectrum has recently been observed at\nscales near k\u03c1e = 1. Alexandrova et al. (2009) suggest that\njust above this scale there is an exponential falloff in the spectrum, and Sahraoui et al. (2009) suggest that below it, there\nis a further steeper power law. Both of these studies involved\nsolar wind intervals where the magnetic field was not aligned\nwith the solar wind direction so that one would expect to see\nthe spectrum in the perpendicular direction. Sahraoui et al.\n(2009) also plot the spectrum of the parallel component of the\nmagnetic field, which, it should be pointed out for clarity, is\nnot the same as the spectrum in the parallel direction.\n5. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nIn Section 2, a relationship was derived that allows the\nturbulent wavevector anisotropy, k\u22a5 /kk , to be inferred from\npower anisotropy measurements, P\u22a5 /Pk . This is independent\nof any particular turbulence theory and only assumes powerlaw scaling in the parallel and perpendicular directions. Using\nthis relation and existing solar wind measurements (Podesta\n\n2009) the wavevector anisotropy near the ion break scale was\nestimated to be k\u22a5 /kk \u2248 3, although this may be an underestimate due to the finite angular resolution of the measurements.\nModel spectra of critically balanced AWs (for the inertial\nrange) and KAWs (for the dissipation range) were presented\nto illustrate that break points do not occur at the same scale in\nthe observed spectra in the parallel and perpendicular directions if the turbulence is anisotropic. The variation of P\u22a5 /Pk\nwith scale was calculated from these model spectra resulting\nin five ranges, three of which have predictions of how P\u22a5 /Pk\nscales: a 1/3 range, a 10/3 range, and an 8/3 range. If the\nwavevector anisotropy is significant then some of these ranges\nare small and may not even be present. Some of these features\ncan be seen in the measurements of Podesta (2009). The main\ndifference is the extra parallel power at the ion break scale\nseen in the measurements, which may be due to energy injection mechanisms at the ion gyroscale.\nAlthough critically balanced AWs and KAWs were used\nin Section 3, the ideas also apply to anisotropic theories of plasma turbulence in general. Some of these,\nfor example, are a nonlocal cascade model (Gogoberidze\n2007), turbulence with dynamic alignment (Boldyrev\n2006; Podesta & Bhattacharjee 2009), wave turbulence in\nHall MHD (Galtier 2006), and imbalanced turbulence\n(Lithwick et al. 2007; Beresnyak & Lazarian 2008; Chandran\n2008). The anisotropy relationship derived in Section 2 and\nthe observational considerations discussed in Sections 3 and\n4 are also applicable to these theories and any possible extensions of them into the dissipation range.\nThis work was funded by STFC and the Leverhulme Trust\nInternational Academic Network for Magnetized Plasma Turbulence.
