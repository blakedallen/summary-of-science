In terms of the function F\uf061 (t ) the Riemann\n2\n\nhypothesis reads simply that there are no zeroes for \uf061 \uf0b9 0 . Note also that F0 (t ) is\nreal; of course F\uf061 (t ) \uf03d F *\uf061 (\uf02dt ) and the relation F\uf061 (t ) \uf03d F\uf02d\uf061 (\uf02dt ) holds. The method\nof proof of our Theorem is a slight generalization of Hardy paper [3] where he\nshowed that there are infinitely many Riemann function zeroes lying on the line\ns \uf03d 1 / 2 \uf02b it .

We\ntake k \uf03e 1 and, for a moment, \uf02d 1 / 2 \uf03c \uf061 \uf03c 1 / 2 . Of course, the integrand is nothing\nelse than F (u ) x \uf02du / 2 hence we are speaking about the integral \uf0f2 F (u ) x \uf02du / 2 du .

(Actually they are a bit easier).

Again, both these cases are\nsimilar. Let \uf061 \uf03d 1 / 2 and consider the contour composed by straight lines\nconnecting the points 1 \uf02d iT , 1 \uf02b iT , k \uf02b iT , k \uf02d iT with k>1 and T \uf0ae \uf02b\uf0a5 which\nsemi-indents then point z=1. Then the repetition of the same that was done\n\uf0a5\nabove gives 1 \uf0f2 cosh(bt / 2) Re F\uf061 (t )dt \uf03d 2 \uf02b 2 cos(b / 2) \uf02d Re((e \uf02dib / 2 \uf02b e ib / 2 )(1 \uf02b 2w(e ib )))\n\n\uf070\n\nand\n\n1\n\n\uf070\n\n\uf0a5\n\n\uf02d\uf0a5\n\n\uf0f2 sinh(bt / 2) Im F\uf061 (t )dt \uf03d 2 sin(b / 2) \uf02d Im((\uf02de\n\n\uf02dib / 2\n\n\uf02b e ib / 2 )(1 \uf02b 2w(e ib ))) ,\n\nwhere\n\n\uf02d\uf0a5\n\nintegrals are the principal values.

First, it looks\ninstructive to compare the situation which, in view of the proven Theorem,\nappears for the Riemann function zeroes with some known function. The trivial\nbut, we believe, illuminative, example, is the \"search\" of zeroes for sinh( z 2 ) (or\nsimilar) function. Of course,\nsinh( x \uf02b iy ) 2 \uf03d sinh( x 2 \uf02d y 2 ) cos(2 xy ) \uf02b i cosh( x 2 \uf02d y 2 ) sin( 2 xy ) thus the real part of\nsinh( z 2 ) has zeroes along the straight lines y \uf03d \uf0b1 x (they may be named\n\nexceptional lines similarly to exceptional line Res=1/2 for the F-function where\nIm F \uf03d 0 ) and along the hyperboles y \uf03d\n\nzeroes along the hyperboles y \uf03d\ny\uf03d\n\n\uf070n / 2\nx\n\n\uf070n / 2\nx\n\n\uf070 / 4 \uf02b \uf070n / 2\nx\n\n, while its imaginary part has\n\n. Of course, hyperboles y \uf03d\n\n\uf070 / 4 \uf02b \uf070n / 2\n\nand\n\nx\n\nhave no intersections (we may say that some \"special symmetry\" is\n\npresent, and for this simple example it is clear which one) and this is just the\nintersections of hyperboles y \uf03d\n\n\uf070n / 2\nx\n\nwith the lines y \uf03d \uf0b1 x which give zeroes of\n\nsinh( z 2 ) function; all of them lye on these two straight lines despite both real and\n\nimaginary parts of the function sinh( z 2 ) have infinitely many zeroes for any x\n(i.e. Rez) \u2013 again in an analogy with the function F(z).\n\n7\n\n\fSecond, it might be instructive to look for the proof of the theorems how\nmany zeroes both real and imaginary parts of F(z) might have. It seems evident\nthat for small enough | \uf061 | real part of F has at least KT zeroes, and apparently\neven KTlnT zeroes, on the segment (1 / 2 \uf02b \uf061 , 1 / 2 \uf02b \uf061 \uf02b iT ) (K is an appropriate\nconstant) simply because for such a case Re F\uf061 (t ) \uf040| F\uf061 (t ) | . It seems that the proof\n1 / 2\uf02b\uf061 \uf02biT\n\nof Hardy and Littlewood based on estimation of integrals\n\n\uf0f2\uf061 F (u ) x\n\n\uf02du / 2\n\ndu over\n\n1 / 2\uf02b \uf02diT\n\nfinite intervals [4] still holds with only minor modifications. Situation is more\ncomplicated with the imaginary part of F which for small | \uf061 | is small and the\nattempt to modify the proof meets serious difficulties. Could we believe that\nexactly the study of the solutions of an equation Im F\uf061 \uf03d 0 for \uf061 \uf0b9 0 , i.e. an\n\uf0a5\n\n2\uf061t\nequation \uf0f2 x \uf02d3 / 4 ( x \uf061 / 2 \uf02d x \uf02d\uf061 / 2 ) sin( t ln x)w( x)dx \uf03d 2\n, might shed some\n2\n(\uf061 \uf02d 1 / 4 \uf02d t 2 ) 2 \uf02b 4\uf061 2 t 2\n1\n\nlight on the Riemann hypothesis?\n\n[1] E.
