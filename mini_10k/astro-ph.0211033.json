Introduction\nThe Hickson compact group of galaxies 31 (HCG31; Hickson\n1982) has recently proven an interesting laboratory for studying various issues related to galaxy formation and merging.\nHCG31 is physically compact. Six of its members fall within\nthe dimensions of a typical giant galaxy, share a common H \uf769\nenvelope (Williams et al. 1991), and span a small range in radial velocities (Rubin et al. 1990; Hickson et al. 1992). It is\ntherefore no surprise that HCG31 shows a wide array of evidence for galaxy interaction including: tidal tails and irregular morphology, complex kinematics, and vigourous star formation, including starbursts with Wolf-Rayet spectral features\n(Rubin et al. 1990; Iglesias-P\u00e1ramo & V\u0131\u0301lchez 1997; Izotov &\nThuan 1998; Johnson et al. 1999; Johnson & Conti 2000).\nRubin et al. (1990) conclude that HCG31 will appear as a\nsingle normal galaxy within a few orbital periods. Here, we difSend offprint requests to: M. G. Richer\n\nfer somewhat from this conclusion. Although we find abundant\nkinematical evidence for recent gravitational interaction among\nthe group members, we suggest that there are other explanations besides imminent coalescence. Likewise, we find chemical abundances for the different components that are unlike\nthose of normal dwarf irregulars, but again argue that their origins may be easily understood. Given the abundant evidence\nfor gravitational interaction, a merger may yet occur in HCG31,\nbut we find that it need not be currently underway.\nIn the following section, we present our data and their reduction. In Sect. 3, we present our results. In Sect. 4, we discuss\nthese results and their implications for the state of HCG31. In\nSect. 5, we present our interpretation of the past and future evolution of HCG31. In Sect. 6, we summarize our conclusions.\nThroughout, we adopt the galaxy nomenclature of Rubin et al.\n(1990) and we assume a distance of 58 Mpc for HCG31, based\nupon a mean redshift of 0.0137 (Hickson et al. 1992) and a\nHubble constant of 71 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 (Mould et al. 2000).

Galaxies A, B, C,\nD, E, and F are shown; galaxies G and Q are to the southeast and north, respectively, as indicated by the arrows. Deeper,\nhigher-resolution images may be found in Rubin et al. (1990),\nIglesias-P\u00e1ramo & V\u0131\u0301lchez (1997), Johnson et al. (1999), and\nJohnson & Conti (2000). The ellipses are meant to illustrate\nschematically the positions of galaxies A, C, E, F and the tidal\ndwarf candidates (denoted by \"T\"; Hunsberger et al. 1996).\nObjects within the component galaxies are labelled using the\ngalaxy component letter and a sequence number, e.g., F1 and\nF2 are subcomponents of galaxy F. Where sub-components are\nlabelled, the parent galaxies are not, to reduce the clutter. North\nis up and east is to the left, as indicated, and 1\u2032\u2032 = 281 pc.\nUnlabelled objects are foreground stars, except that north-east\nof galaxy D, which is a reflection. The filled circles indicate the\nlocations of the apertures used for multi-object spectroscopy.\npreliminary version of some of our results was presented by\nRosado et al. (1999).\n\n2. Observations and reductions\nThe Fabry-Perot (FP) observations of HCG31 were carried out\non 1 November 1997 at the f/7.5 Cassegrain focus of the 2.1 m\ntelescope of the Observatorio Astron\u00f3mico Nacional in San\nPedro M\u00e1rtir, B.C., M\u00e9xico using the UNAM Scanning FabryPerot Interferometer PUMA (Rosado et al. 1995). The scanning FP interferometer is based upon an ET-50 Queensgate\nInstruments etalon with a servo-stabilization system. The H\u03b1\nline is observed in interference order 330, within a free spectral\nrange of 19.89\u00c5, and sampled at 48 steps of 0.43\u00c5 separation\n(18.9 km s\u22121 ). The spectral resolution of these observations is\n38.4 km s\u22121 . The effective finesse obtained with this setup was\n24. Since HCG31 subtends only 2\u2032 and we were careful to place\nit at the center of the instrument's field of view (10\u2032 ) when acquiring the data cubes, the effective finesse of the observations\nis the same. In any case, PUMA does not show important variations of the effective finesse across the field. A 30\u00c5 interference\nfilter, centered at the wavelength of redshifted H\u03b1, was used to\nisolate the H\u03b1 emission line from HCG31. The detector was\n\na 1024\u00d71024, thinned Tektronix CCD. The image scale was\n0.\u2032\u2032 59 pixel\u22121 , yielding a 10\u2032 field of view. In order to increase\nthe S/N of the observations, the detector was used with a 2 \u00d7 2\npixel binning.\nWe obtained two data cubes of HCG31 in H\u03b1 with exposure times of 48 minutes each (1 minute/channel). These\ndata cubes were co-added to enhance the S/N of the faint regions. The seeing was about 1.\u2032\u2032 2. The transparency conditions\nwere rather good and we obtained both cubes during dark time.\nNevertheless, we corrected both data cubes for transparency\nvariations before co-adding them. This was done using two\nfield stars (located outside the region shown in Fig. 1) and we\nverified that the profiles were similar.\nWe obtained wavelength calibration data cubes of a Ne\nlamp at the beginning and end of the observations, which also\nserve to check for possible equipment flexures. Since the redshifted H\u03b1 emission of HCG31 differs from the wavelength\nof the calibration lamp, a phase shift correction was applied,\nwhich amounted to a shift in the zero-point of the velocities\nof 22 km s\u22121 . The CIGALE software package (Le Coarer et al.\n1993) was used to apply this phase shift correction, to remove\ncosmic rays, calibrate in wavelength, and construct the radial\nvelocity cubes. We also used some routines from the Image\nReduction and Analysis Facility (IRAF)1 for parts of the data\nreduction.\nThe multi-object spectroscopy of the galaxies in HCG31\nwas obtained with the 2.1m telescope of the Observatorio\nAstrof\u0131\u0301sico Guillermo Haro in Cananea, M\u00e9xico on 10 January\n1999. The LFOSC spectrograph was used, which is a transmission spectrograph employing a grism as the dispersing element (Zickgraf et al. 1997). The spectrograph's dispersion\nwas approximately 5.5 \u00c5/pix and the spectra typically spanned\nfrom 4000\u00c5 to 6600\u00c5, though the exact spectral range varied according to the object's position within the spectrograph's\nfield of view. The detector was a 576 \u00d7 384 EEV CCD.\nSince the spectrograph has very poor response in the blue,\nno order-sorting filter was used. The objects were selected for\nspectroscopy using focal plane masks made from previouslyacquired images. The only restriction for object selection is that\nthey may not be aligned in declination since the dispersion axis\nis oriented east-west. Pairs of holes were cut for object and sky\nat the same right ascension so as to ensure identical spectral\ncoverage. The holes were 3\u2032\u2032 in diameter.\nThe objects selected for spectroscopy are shown in Fig. 1,\nwith the exception of galaxy Q (Rubin et al. 1990), which is to\nthe north of the field. The total integration time was 1.5 hours.\nThe standard stars HD 19445, HD 74721, and HD 109995\nwere observed for flux calibration. The standard stars were observed through masks cut for various object fields.\nThe multi-object spectroscopy was reduced using the IRAF\nsoftware package, specifically the noao.imred.specred package. The bias images were first combined and the result subtracted from all of the images.

The continuity of the\nkinematics for galaxies A, C, and E is particularly striking, and\nprobably indicates that these three components are a single entity. Galaxy Q was not detected in our Fabry-Perot data cubes,\nwhile the H\u03b1 line from galaxy D is shifted outside our filter by\nthis galaxy's much higher radial velocity (Hickson et al. 1992).\nIn all panels, north is up, east is to the left, and 1\u2032\u2032 = 281 pc.\nthen removed using spectra of the internal lamp. Subsequently,\nthe sky was subtracted from each object. Spectra of the NeAr lamp were used for wavelength calibration. Finally, the flux\ncalibration was made using the standard star observations.\n\n3. Results\nFigs. 2 and 3 present the radial velocity and velocity dispersion\nmaps resulting from our Fabry-Perot spectroscopy at H\u03b1. To\ncompute these maps, we computed the average intensity and its\nstandard deviation over all channels at each spatial pixel. Then,\nwe determined the median value of this standard deviation over\nall spatial pixels in the image and adopted this as representative of the noise in the sky throughout the image. Finally, at\neach spatial pixel, the maximum of the intensities in all channels was compared to this noise value. For those spatial pixels\nwhere the maximum intensity in some channel exceeded five\ntimes the noise value, a gaussian was fit to the velocity profile.\nThe peak position and the standard deviation of this gaussian\nfit were adopted as the radial velocity and velocity dispersion,\nrespectively, at that spatial position.\n\n3\n\nFig. 3. The velocity dispersion map of galaxies A and C in H\u03b1.\nThe colour scale shows the range in velocity dispersion values.\nHere, we characterize the velocity dispersion as the standard\ndeviation of the gaussian fit to the velocity profile. Only galaxies A and C showed significant internal variations in velocity\ndispersion, so they are the only ones shown here. The contours\nshow the total H\u03b1 flux from the Fabry-Perot observations. As\nusual, north is up, east is to the left, and 1\u2032\u2032 = 281 pc.\nIn Fig. 2, our radial velocities and velocity profiles are in\ngood agreement with those found by Rubin et al. (1990). In\nFig. 4, we present several simulated profiles for the positions\nand position angles corresponding to Figs. 2 and 3 of Rubin\net al. (1990). Galaxy Q was not detected in our data cubes,\nwhile galaxy D's much higher radial velocity shifted its H\u03b1\nline outside our filter.\nIn Fig. 3, we present the velocity dispersions in galaxies A\nand C. We present a map of the velocity dispersion for galaxies\nA and C only, since no other galaxies showed significant internal variations in velocity dispersion. The velocity dispersions\nin galaxies B, E, and F are approximately 50 km s\u22121 , similar\nto our instrumental resolution, while the velocity dispersion in\ngalaxy G is slightly higher.\nTable 1 lists the raw line intensities relative to H\u03b2 and the\nraw radial velocities we measured in the H \uf769\uf769 regions in the different components of HCG31. The uncertainties quoted for the\nline intensities are 1\u03c3 uncertainties and include the uncertainty\nin the fits to both the line and the reference line as well as the\nuncertainty in the continuum placement for both lines.

We used Wabs = 1.9\u00c5 (McCall et al. 1985)\nsince our spectra had neither the resolution nor the signal-tonoise required to measure this directly.

Values of A1 (\u03bb) were taken from the\nSchild (1977) reddening law. We used the H\u03b1/H\u03b2 ratio to determine the reddening, except when H\u03b1 fell outside our wavelength range, in which case the H\u03b3/H\u03b2 ratio was used. In all\ncases, we adopted theoretical ratios of I(H\u03b1)/I(H\u03b2) = 2.86 and\nI(H\u03b3)/I(H\u03b2) = 0.468, appropriate for electron temperatures\nand densities of 104 K and 100 cm\u22123 , respectively (Osterbrock\n1989).\nThe radial velocities given in Table 1 are the raw radial velocities measured for the H\u03b1 line from the multi-object spectra, and are meant primarily to show that galaxy Q has a radial\nvelocity consistent with group membership, and similar to the\nH \uf769 velocity found by Williams et al. (1991). Galaxy Q is the\nfaintest of the components we observed, which may explain\nwhy it is so faint in the H\u03b1 image presented by Rubin et al.\n(1990) and absent from our H\u03b1 data cubes. We cannot restrict\ngalaxy Q's morphological type since the V-band and H\u03b1 images we obtained to identify H \uf769\uf769 regions are of low spatial resolution and signal-to-noise and were never calibrated.\n\nTable 2.

The relation between luminosity and metallicity for the\ngalaxies in HCG31. The components are labelled. The solid\nline is the relation for dwarf irregulars found by Richer &\nMcCall (1995), while the dashed line is an extrapolation of that\nrelation. The galaxies in HCG31 are clearly discrepant, with\ncomponents A and C much too luminous for their abundances.\n\ntry of Iglesias-P\u00e1ramo & V\u0131\u0301lchez (1997). No photometry exists for galaxy F. Here, we assume it has the same luminosity\nas galaxy E (Iglesias-P\u00e1ramo & V\u0131\u0301lchez 1997), which, though\nit is a rough approximation, is sufficient for our purposes. In\nTable 2, we adopted the uncertainties in the luminosities of\ngalaxies B and C from Hickson et al. (1988). For galaxy A,\nwe set the uncertainty in luminosity equal to that for galaxy\nC due to the difficulty of disentangling the two galaxies. We\narbitrarily estimate an uncertainty of 1.0 mag in the luminosity of galaxy F. In Fig. 5, we plot the oxygen abundance as a\nfunction of the galaxy luminosity. We converted from apparent\nto absolute magnitudes using an apparent distance modulus of\n34.02 mag, which accounts for our adopted distance and an extinction of AB = 0.21 mag, based upon E(B \u2212 V) = 0.055 mag\n(Schlegel et al. 1998) and the Fitzpatrick (1999) reddening law\n(RV = 3.1 and E(B \u2212 V) = 1 mag). We also show the relation\nbetween oxygen abundance and luminosity for dwarf irregulars\nfor comparison (Richer & McCall 1995).\nFig. 4. This figure presents velocity profiles of galaxies A, B,\nand C extracted at the same positions and position angles as\nRubin et al. (1990). Each panel indicates the position angle of\nthe simulated slit. The agreement is very good for both the velocities and the velocity profiles, any discrepancies being of\norder 10 km/s (compare with their Figs. 2 and 3). We are not\nas sensitive to low surface brightness emission, so our profiles\nhave a smaller spatial extent than those of Rubin et al. (1990).\nFor each galaxy, we adopted what appeared to be the best\nabundance determination available, indicated in the footnotes\nto Table 2, using the precision quoted in the original papers as\nour guide. For galaxies A, B, and C, we adopted the Hickson\net al. (1988) B-band magnitudes at the 24.5 mag/\u2293\n\u2294\u2032\u2032 isophote\nsince these seem to be in better agreement with the photome-\n\n4. The state of HCG31 today\nOur most surprising result is that galaxies A and C appear to be\na single kinematical entity. In Fig. 2, their kinematics show no\ndiscontinuity. We interpret this as evidence that galaxies A and\nC are a single entity at present. Mendes de Oliveira & Amram\n(2000) and Amram & Mendes de Oliveira (2000) find similar\nresults from similar kinematical data.\nAnother surprise is that galaxy E's position and velocity\nare compatible with it also being an integral part of the A+C\ncomplex. If galaxy E is in fact a separate entity, it is just now\nseparating from the A+C complex. In any case, its kinematics\nconfirm that the extension of the A+C complex towards galaxies E and F is a tidal tail.\n\n\f6\n\nRicher, M. G. et al.: Is HCG31 undergoing a merger or a fly-by interaction?\n\nLike galaxy E, the tidal dwarfs to the north-east of galaxies A and C identified by Hunsberger et al. (1996) also have\nkinematics consistent with their being integral components of\nthe A+C complex. Furthermore, given the red continuum image presented by Johnson & Conti (2000), it is not evident that\nat least the nearer of these supposed tidal dwarfs are separate\nentities.\nMeanwhile, galaxy F is an excellent example of a tidal fragment. Considering its position and radial velocity (Figs. 1 and\n2), it seems clear that galaxy F is a tidal fragment of the A+C\ncomplex that detached some time ago. Remarkably, galaxy F\nhas the same oxygen abundance as galaxies A and C, despite\nbeing more than 5 mag fainter than galaxy C (cf. Table 2 and\nFig. 5). In addition, since an underlying stellar population has\nyet to be detected in galaxy F (Johnson & Conti 2000), it cannot be responsible for its own chemical enrichment. All of these\nobservations argue that galaxy F is a tidal fragment of the A+C\ncomplex.\nGalaxy B exhibits solid-body rotation. Given its broadband\nmorphology (Rubin et al. 1990; Iglesias-P\u00e1ramo & V\u0131\u0301lchez\n1997), it is likely a dwarf spiral or irregular seen nearly edgeon. Kinematically, galaxy B is distinct from the A+C complex\nand is counter-rotating with respect to it.\nGalaxy G appears to be a small disk galaxy seen nearly\nface-on since the H\u03b1 velocity has only a very small gradient\nacross its disk.\nThe velocity dispersion map (Fig. 3) of the ionized gas is\nmore difficult to interpret. The highest velocity dispersions occur along a ridge between the main bodies of galaxies A and C.\nWhether this higher velocity dispersion is due to a more complicated gas distribution or kinematics is indeterminate from\nour observations.\nIt is evident from Fig. 5 that the oxygen abundances in\nthe galaxies in HCG31 are unusual. Although they span 5 mag\nin luminosity, all of the galaxies have nearly identical oxygen\nabundances. This conclusion is independent of the uncertainty\nin separating the luminosities of galaxies A and C, since, were\nwe to consider their combined luminosity and either of the\noxygen abundances observed (Table 2), the resulting position\nwould remain highly discrepant compared to the relation for\nnormal dwarf irregular galaxies. However, galaxy C's luminosity is much greater than that of most dwarfs and more like that\nof a typical late-type spiral. If the A+C complex were a latetype spiral, its oxygen abundance may be more easily understood. Given the strong inflows and consequent high star formation rate expected due to tidal interactions (e.g., Mihos &\nHernquist 1996; Barnes & Hernquist 1996), the mass of gas\nexpected in the outer disks of late-type spirals, and the low\noxygen abundances observed in these regions (Ferguson et al.\n1998; van Zee et al. 1998), the unusual positions of galaxies\nA and C in Fig. 5 are understandable as the result of dilution\ndue to strong gas inflow and the transient high luminosity due\nto a starburst. At any rate, galaxy C's position is compatible\nwith the extreme low end of the abundance range for late-type\nspirals (Garnett et al. 1997). Given galaxy F's origin within the\nA+C complex, it should naturally have the same oxygen abundance as the A+C complex.\n\nGalaxy B, meanwhile, appears more or less normal. It has\na B-band luminosity at the bright end of the range found for\ndwarf irregulars, about 0.8 mag brighter than the LMC's, and\nan oxygen abundance similar to that of the LMC. Its H\u03b1 luminosity, 1.0 \u00d7 1041 erg s\u22121 (Iglesias-P\u00e1ramo & V\u0131\u0301lchez 1997,\ncorrected to our adopted distance), implies a global star formation rate of 0.8 M\u2299 yr\u22121 (Kennicutt 1998), which is not unusual for a late-type galaxy (Kennicutt 1983). However, its\ncolours are significantly bluer than those of typical dwarf irregulars or late-type spirals (Iglesias-P\u00e1ramo & V\u0131\u0301lchez 1997;\nde Vaucouleurs et al. 1981; Roberts & Haynes 1994), being\na near-perfect match to those of a single stellar population of\nmetallicity Z = 0.008 and an age of 40 Myr (Bressan et al.\n1994). Thus, galaxy B is currently forming stars more actively\nthan it has formed them on average in the past, perhaps as a\nresult of the group environment. In spite of this, galaxy B's recent history of star formation appears to be distinct from that of\nthe A+C complex (Iglesias-P\u00e1ramo & V\u0131\u0301lchez 1997; Johnson\n& Conti 2000).\n\n5. The past and future\nThe kinematical evidence argues strongly that the A+C complex has undergone very significant, recent, tidal interaction,\nbut that it is now a single entity. In addition, the kinematical\nproperties of galaxies E, F, and the tidal candidates identified\nby Hunsberger et al. (1996) all provide evidence of their origin\nwithin the A+C complex. What, then, are the possible origins\nof these tidal interactions, and might these shed some light on\nthe nature of HCG31? A related issue is that of the nature of\nthe original components of HCG31.\nThe global H \uf769 mass and blue luminosity of HCG31 provide\nsome clues regarding the original composition of HCG31. The\nH \uf769 mass of HCG31 is strikingly high, 2.5 \u00d7 1010 M\u2299 adjusted\nto our adopted distance (Williams et al. 1991), which would be\ntypical of a massive Sb or Sc spiral (Roberts & Haynes 1994).\nThe oxygen abundances, however, are incompatible with those\nof such massive galaxies save those found in their extreme\nouter disks (Garnett et al. 1997; Ferguson et al. 1998; van\nZee et al. 1998). The blue luminosities of galaxies A+C, B,\nand G imply morphological types Scd, Sm, and Sd (Roberts\n& Haynes 1994), though these are all undoubtedly affected by\ntheir significant recent star formation. The total H \uf769 mass is also\nconsistent with the sum of three late-type spirals (or one such\nspiral and two bright irregulars; Roberts & Haynes 1994). As\nnoted above, the oxygen abundances of A+C and B are compatible with such progenitors, though that for A+C would be\nat the low end of the range expected (Richer & McCall 1995;\nGarnett et al. 1997). Finally, the global LB /M(H i) for the entire\ngroup is approximately unity, a value typical of dwarf irregulars (Roberts & Haynes 1994). Despite the uncertainty due to\nthe recent star formation, all of the available evidence points\ntoward the group being initially composed of late-type spirals\nand irregulars.\nThe kinematical evolution of HCG31 is a more ambiguous\npuzzle. Based upon the galaxy morphologies and less complete\nkinematical data than we present here, an on-going merger between galaxies A and C has been invoked to explain the tidal\n\n\fRicher, M. G. et al.: Is HCG31 undergoing a merger or a fly-by interaction?\n\nfeatures observed (e.g., Rubin et al. 1990). However, this explanation leaves a number of issues unresolved, the two most\nimportant of which are the coincidence of galaxy G with a\npeak in the H \uf769 distribution at the end of a tidal tail and the\nvery similar recent star formation histories in galaxies A, C,\nE, F, and G (Williams et al. 1991; Iglesias-P\u00e1ramo & V\u0131\u0301lchez\n1997; Johnson et al. 1999). The continuity of the kinematics\nof the A+C complex is an additional important complication\nsince it implies that the interaction would be in an advanced,\nsettled stage, in contrast to numerical simulations that indicate\nthat most of the star formation ought to occur at the onset of\nthe interaction (Barnes & Hernquist 1996; Mihos & Hernquist\n1996). Likewise, the blue colours of the star clusters in galaxies A and C imply that any merger should be in an initial phase\n(Johnson et al. 1999).\nIn view of the continuous kinematics of the A+C complex\n(see also Amram & Mendes de Oliveira 2000), we propose that\nan encounter between it and galaxy G is a more likely origin for\nthe tidal interaction that is so evident. This encounter scenario\nnaturally accounts for the position of galaxy G, embedded in\nthe south-east tidal tail of the H \uf769 distribution (Williams et al.\n1991). An encounter between galaxy G and the A+C complex\nalso easily explains the very similar histories of the most recent\nstar formation in galaxies A+C, E, F, and G noted by IglesiasP\u00e1ramo & V\u0131\u0301lchez (1997) and Johnson & Conti (2000), despite their physical separation of up to 40 kpc, since such an\nencounter would provoke strong gas inflow and presumably\nvigourous star formation in galaxy G, the A+C complex, and in\nthe tidal material (Mihos et al. 1992; Mihos & Hernquist 1996;\nBarnes & Hernquist 1996). Such strong gas inflow would also\nexplain the low oxygen abundance measured in the A+C complex as a result of dilution by metal-poor gas. The coordinated\nstar formation, the global morphology and kinematics of the\nH \uf769 gas (Williams et al. 1991), and the positions of galaxies\nA+C, E, F, and G are all very reminiscent of the fly-by and\nmerger simulations of Mihos et al. (1992), Mihos & Hernquist\n(1996), and Barnes & Hernquist (1996). Finally, O'Halloran\net al. (2002) conclude that the burst of star formation in the\nA+C complex may be evolving to a post-starburst phase, based\nupon ISO data, a result compatible with the encounter scenario if galaxy G is now moving away from the A+C complex. Therefore, unless galaxy G occupies its position purely\nby chance, we propose that an encounter between it and the\nA+C complex accounts for more of the properties of HCG31\nin a more natural fashion than does a merger of galaxies A and\nC.\nAn important uncertainty in the encounter scenario is the\ntransverse velocity implied between galaxy G and the A+C\ncomplex. Given their very similar radial velocities, the bulk\nof their relative motion must be in the plane of the sky (Fig.\n2; Rubin et al. 1990; Hickson et al. 1992). At a distance\nof 58 Mpc, the 2.\u2032 4 separation of galaxy G and the A+C\ncomplex corresponds to a linear distance of 40 kpc. If the\nages of the most recent star formation, < 108 years (IglesiasP\u00e1ramo & V\u0131\u0301lchez 1997; Johnson et al. 1999), are taken as the\ntime elapsed since the putative encounter, the separation implies a transverse velocity in the plane of the sky exceeding\n400 km s\u22121 . This velocity greatly exceeds the internal veloc-\n\n7\n\nity dispersions we measure in these galaxies (Fig. 3; Sect. 3),\nand it is not obvious whether this encounter velocity should\nprovoke such a strong interaction (e.g., Binney & Tremaine\n1987). The time scale could be lengthened, and the transverse\nvelocity lowered, if there is a delay between closest approach\nand the initiation of star formation, as some models indicate\n(e.g., Mihos et al. 1992; Mihos & Hernquist 1996). On the\nother hand, neither the velocity nor the spatial extension between galaxy G and the A+C complex are unusual. HCG26\nis very similar (Williams & van Gorkom 1995), while HCG16\nhas a similar morphology on a larger scale (Verdes-Montenegro\net al. 2001). NGC 7318b in Stephan's Quintet (HCG92) has\nbeen stripped of its H \uf769 despite a velocity of order 1000 km s\u22121\nrelative to the other group members (Sulentic et al. 2001).\nLikewise, UGC 7636 in the Virgo cluster has had its interstellar medium stripped by NGC 4472 though their relative velocities differ by about 700 km s\u22121 (Patterson & Thuan 1992;\nMcNamara et al. 1994; Lee et al. 2000). Therefore, although\nthe response of the H \uf769 in fly-by encounters appears to be relatively unexplored theoretically, observational examples appear\nreasonably common, lending credence to the idea that an interaction between galaxies G and A+C could be the origin of the\ntidal debris seen in HCG31.\nIf the gravitational interaction between galaxy G and the\nA+C complex is the origin of the tidal debris in HCG31, it is\nthen also possible that the A+C complex has always been a\nsingle entity and need not represent the fusion of two galaxies,\npartially confirming the hypothesis of Plana et al. (2000). The\nsimulations of fly-by and merger interactions indicate that very\nstrong gas inflows may be induced (Mihos et al. 1992; Mihos\n& Hernquist 1996; Barnes & Hernquist 1996) and such inflows\nare indeed observed in HCG31 (Williams et al. 1991), though\nthe H \uf769 kinematics are slightly compromised since their spatial\nresolution is insufficient to clearly separate the gas belonging\nto galaxy B from that belonging to the A+C complex. The distribution of the star formation observed in the A+C complex\ncould simply be a typical result of the gas inflows predicted\nby the numerical simulations. Likewise, the low oxygen abundances could easily result from dilution due to the inflow of\nmetal-poor material from the outer disk.\nWhat might be the eventual outcome of HCG31? If an encounter between galaxy G and the A+C complex is the origin of\nthe tidal interactions, and if their orbits are unbound, the A+C\ncomplex will likely evolve similar to the simulations of ring\ngalaxies (e.g., Struck 1997), and the A+C complex should remain as a disk galaxy. If, on the contrary, their orbits are bound,\na merger that will likely also consume galaxies E, F, and the\ntidal dwarfs postulated by Hunsberger et al. (1996) is the probable result. Finally, if the interaction between galaxies A and C\nis the origin of the tidal debris in HCG31, as has been usually\nsupposed (e.g., Rubin et al. 1990; Johnson et al. 1999; Mendes\nde Oliveira & Amram 2000), a merger already appears to be\nwell underway.\nIn either case of a merger, we expect that a low mass elliptical would be the eventual outcome, as suggested by Rubin\net al. (1990). The group's H\u03b1 luminosity is 1 \u00d7 1042 erg s\u22121\n(Iglesias-P\u00e1ramo & V\u0131\u0301lchez 1997, adjusted to our distance),\nimplying a star formation rate of 7.9 M\u2299 yr\u22121 (Kennicutt 1998).\n\n\f8\n\nRicher, M. G. et al.: Is HCG31 undergoing a merger or a fly-by interaction?\n\nAlthough high, this rate of star formation is sustainable for a\nlong time, at least another 3 Gyr given the group's H \uf769 mass of\n2.5 \u00d7 1010 M\u2299 (Williams et al. 1991). Most of this H \uf769 mass\nis contained within an area of 3\u2032 \u00d7 1\u2032 (Williams et al. 1991),\n8.6 \u00d7 108 pc2 at our adopted distance, implying a gas surface\nmass density of about 30 M\u2299 pc\u22122 . Supposing a conversion efficiency from H \uf769 gas into stars of approximately 10% at this\nsurface density (Kennicutt 1998) and that at least 50-60% of the\nmass converted to stars will produce long-lived stars (K\u00f6ppen\n& Arimoto 1991), we infer that the eventual outcome could\nbe a galaxy with a stellar mass of several 109 M\u2299 . This mass is\nseveral times larger than the current mass estimates: the colours\nfrom Iglesias-P\u00e1ramo & V\u0131\u0301lchez (1997) are completely dominated by the light from young stars, and therefore imply only\nlower limits to the stellar mass of order 3\u00d7108 M\u2299 , based upon\nthe colours of the single stellar populations from Bressan et al.\n(1994). Therefore, it is reasonable to expect an eventual metal\nproduction at least equal to that which has already occurred,\naccompanied by a similar increase in the chemical abundances.\nSeveral Gyr after the cessation of star formation, a galaxy with\na stellar mass of several 109 M\u2299 would have a luminosity of\nMB \u2248 \u221218 mag (e.g., Bressan et al. 1994) and its oxygen abundance would place it above the metallicity-luminosity relation\nfor dwarf irregulars. Given that the velocity gradients in the H \uf769\ngas found by Williams et al. (1991) imply generally radial inflow, rather than rotation, we infer that the probable outcome\nwill be an elliptical galaxy. Although the foregoing is entirely\nspeculative, it illustrates that HCG31 could very plausibly produce a typical low-luminosity elliptical with normal chemical\nabundances (e.g., Richer et al. 1998).\n\n6. Conclusions\nSomewhat at variance with previous studies, it is less evident\nto us that HCG31 is a clear example of an on-going merger.\nIt is undeniable, however, that there is significant tidal interaction underway among the members of this compact group.\nGiven their kinematics, galaxies A, C, and the tidal dwarfs to\nthe north-east identified by Hunsberger et al. (1996) all appear\nto be a single entity at present (the A+C complex). Galaxy E\nis probably also an integral part of this complex, otherwise it is\na tidal fragment that has very recently separated. Galaxy F has\nboth kinematics and chemical abundances that indicate that it\nis a tidal fragment that was part of the A+C complex in the\nrelatively recent past. At this point, galaxies B and G remain\nkinematically distinct from the A+C complex. Finally, we find\na velocity for galaxy Q (Rubin et al. 1990) that is compatible\nwith it also being a member of HCG31.\nWe propose that a gravitational interaction between galaxy\nG and the A+C complex is the most complete explanation of\nthe events occurring in HCG31. This scenario naturally accounts for the positions and kinematics of galaxies A, C, E, F,\nG, and the tidal dwarf candidates of Hunsberger et al. (1996),\nthe morphology and kinematics of the H \uf769 (Williams et al.\n1991), the chemical abundances, and the coordinated star formation in galaxies separated by up to 40 kpc (Iglesias-P\u00e1ramo\n& V\u0131\u0301lchez 1997; Johnson & Conti 2000). In this case, the A+C\ncomplex may have always been a single entity, a late-type spi-\n\nral, and its current irregular morphology, high luminosity, blue\ncolours, and anomalous chemical abundance may simply be a\nconsequence of multiple bursts of star formation as a result of\nstrong gas inflows induced by its interaction with galaxy G\n(Barnes & Hernquist 1996; Mihos & Hernquist 1996). If this\nis the case, a merger may still eventually occur between galaxy\nG and the A+C complex given the ample evidence for a strong\ngravitational interaction. While there is no evidence that the\nkinematical properties of HCG31 are not the result of an ongoing merger between galaxies A and C, many additional details\nare not accounted for by this solution, particularly the coordinated star formation and the location of galaxy G.\nBased upon its oxygen abundance, its broad-band and H\u03b1\nluminosities, and its kinematics, at present galaxy B appears\nto be a relatively normal late-type spiral or bright dwarf irregular seen nearly edge-on. Its evolution is probably now being\naffected by the group environment, since its colours are very\nblue and indicate that its current rate of star formation exceeds\nits historical average rate.\nAcknowledgements.
