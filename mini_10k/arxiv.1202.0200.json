A relationship between the number of permutations used and the\nimprovement of performance is presented. This can be used as a method for increasing the\ncryptographic strength of pseudorandom sequences.\nIntroduction\nPseudorandom sequences that are algorithmically produced have limited cryptographic\napplications because the eavesdropper can readily generate them. The complexity of the\ngeneration process and the lack of correlation amongst the bits (or digits) of the sequence are\nimportant in determining the usefulness of a pseudorandom sequence. A quantum mechanical\nprocess can be used to generate a true random sequence but the problem with such an approach\nis that such sequences cannot be replicated. Classical random sequences also find use in quantum\ncryptography applications since the random base choices or rotations there, either in the BB84\nprotocol [1] or the three-stage protocol [2]-[4], must be generated by an algorithmic process.\nTo develop a method of improving the quality of pseudorandom sequences, the question of a\nmetric for the degree of randomness must be addressed. There are several ways the randomness\nof a binary sequence is defined statistically [5] and from a computational complexity point of\nview [6]. The problem of randomness is complicated by entanglement in quantum systems\n[7],[8] and it shall not be considered here. One popular method of defining randomness of an nbit long sequence a(i) is given by the following formula\n1\n\n1\n1\n\n|\n\n|\n\nwhere c(k) is the autocorrelation function\n1/ \u2211\n, where the sequence is\nrepresented in terms of +1s and -1s. . This is intuitively satisfactory since for a completely\nrandom binary sequence this randomness measure is equal to 1 and for a constant sequence the\nrandomness measure is 0. For a maximul length shift-register sequence of period 2k [9], the\nrandomness measure is 1-1/n. For good pseudo-random sequences, the randomness measure will\nbe a number just less than 1.\nPrime reciprocal sequences or d-sequences [10]-[14] have many applications andany pseudorandom sequence can be mapped to a suitable d-sequence. As seen in Figure 1, the randomness\nmeasure gets closer to 1 as the period of the d-sequence increases which is perfectly consistent\nwith the theorem that prime reciprocal sequences are normal sequences.\n\n1\n\n\fFiguree 1. Random\nmness measurre of prime rreciprocal seequences to 2200\nA numbeer x is simplly normal in\nn base r if in\nn the decimaal of x each oof the r possible digits ooccur\nwith a frequency 1/r, i.e.,lim\n\n\u2192\n\nforr all b, wheree the digit b occurs nb tiimes in the ffirst n\n\nnd a number x is normal in base r if all\na of the nuumbers x, rx,\nx, r2x,... are simply norm\nmal in\nplaces an\n2 3\nall of basses r, r , r ,... It follow\nws that when\nn x is expresssed as a deccimal in the scale of r, eevery\ncombinattion b1, b2, b3, ... of dig\ngits occurs with\nw the propper frequenccies. Thus, thhe property tthat a\nnumber is\ni normal in base r may\ny be reiterateed by sayingg that all thee digits 0 - ((r - 1) occurr with\nequal pro\nobability, and that each digit\nd\nof the sequence\ns\nis independentt of every otther digit. Allmost\nall numbers are norm\nmal in any baase.\nNevertheeless, from a practical point\np\nof view\nw, given prim\nme reciprocaal sequencess are not enntirely\nsatisfacto\nory. To see this\nt first note that the prrime reciproccal sequencee a(i), i = 1,,2,3,... for pprime\np (that is the sequencce 1/p in basee 2) can be generated\ng\nas a(i) = 2i mood p mod 2 ((Reference [[12]):\nb(0)= 1\nb(i+1) = 2b(ii) mod p\na(i)=b(i) mod\nd2\nMaximum\nm length (wiith period p--1) prime recciprocal sequuences are ggenerated whhen 2 is prim\nmitive\nroot of p..\nh maximum length binaary prime reciprocal\nr\nseequences haave excellennt autocorrellation\nAlthough\npropertiees they havee the negativ\nve peak of -1\n- for half tthe period tthat reflects the fact thaat the\nsequencee after half th\nhe period is a complemeentary imagee of the first half. As exaample, the bbinary\nd-sequen\nnce for 1/13 is 000100111011 where the last 6 bits are com\nmplements oof the first 6 bits.\n2\n\n\fThis means that although the randomness measure of such sequences is high, it is not very useful\nin this context.\nWe suggest performing another transformation on the given sequence. In contrast to an earlier\npreliminary study [15] where groups of bits were mapped to a single bit based on plurality of 0s\nor 1s to improve autocorrelation properties, here we consider the effect of block permutations on\nautocorrelation. A number of different random permutations are applied to the blocks of the\ncandidate pseudorandom sequence. We will show that doing so improves the autocorrelation\nperformance considerably. The specific questions that are answered in this paper include a\nrelationship between number of different permutations used and the improvement of\nperformance.\nChoosing Blocks for Permutations\nA d-sequence can be divided into either even number of blocks or odd number of blocks. The\nperformance of the permutation for the d-sequences does depend on whether the number of\nblocks is even or odd. For example, the d-sequence of the prime number 1277 can be divided\ninto blocks in a variety of ways as 1276 has factors 2, 4, 11, and 29. Here we will consider the\ndivision of 1276 into 58 blocks of size 22 bits or 319 blocks of size 4 bits.\nIn the general case, the sequence S can be represented as the concatenation of blocks S1S2S3S4...\nWe represent an n-permutation by the operator Pn = P1P2P3... so that the permutations P1, P2,\nP3,... are applied in sequence. For example, 3-permutation P3 will work as follows:\nP3(S) = P1(S1) P2 (S2) P3(S3) P1(S4) P2(S5) ...\nIn the first experiment, we consider the d-sequence of length 1276 which is divided into 58\nblocks that is S1, S2, S3... S58. We generated a random permutation, P, of size 22. This\npermutation,P is applied on all the 58 blocks of the d-sequence. If the position of each digit is\nrepresented with the help of an alphabet as follows.\n1 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1\na b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v\nP is the permutation \"hajblcfedgikovusrqnpmt\" and it transforms the given block to\n1100110100111111011101. This random permutation \"hajblcfedgikovusrqnpmt\" is applied on\neach of 58 blocks of the sequence. We have conducted this experiment many times where the\npermutation P varies in each experiment. The average of all auto-correlation values is plotted in\nthe graph shown in Figure 2.\n\n3\n\n\f1.5\n1\n0.5\n\n\u20100.5\n\n1\n57\n113\n169\n225\n281\n337\n393\n449\n505\n561\n617\n673\n729\n785\n841\n897\n953\n1009\n1065\n1121\n1177\n1233\n\n0\n\n\u20101\n\u20101.5\n\nFigure 2 Autocorrelation of the d-sequence with a single permutation applied on its 58 blocks of\nsize 22 digits each\nTo stress the difference with odd number of blocks, we next consider 319 blocks of size 4 digits\neach of the d-sequence of 1277. We applied a single permutation P, on all the 319 blocks as we\ndid in the case of even number of blocks. The graph in Figure 3 shows the auto-correlation\nvalues of the d-sequence for odd number of blocks. As the autocorrelation function for half the\nperiod is less than what it was for the case of even number of blocks, this clearly shows that the\nperformance of permutation process varies for even and odd number of blocks.\n1.5\n1\n0.5\n\n\u20100.5\n\n1\n55\n109\n163\n217\n271\n325\n379\n433\n487\n541\n595\n649\n703\n757\n811\n865\n919\n973\n1027\n1081\n1135\n1189\n1243\n\n0\n\n\u20101\n\nFigure 3 Autocorrelation of the d-sequence with a single permutation applied on its 319 blocks\nof size 4 digits each\n\n4\n\n\fNext, as a continuation of the first experiment on the d-sequence for even number of blocks, we\ngenerated two random permutations P1, P2 of length 22 each. The permutation P1 is applied on\nblock1 and the permutation P2 is applied on block2. Then the same two permutations P1 and P2\nare applied on block3 and block4 respectively. This is repeated for all the 58 blocks of the dsequence. We conducted the experiment many times where the permutations P1 and P2 are\ndifferent every time and plotted the average of the autocorrelation values in the graph shown in\nFigure 4.\n1.2\n1\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n\u20100.2\n\n1\n57\n113\n169\n225\n281\n337\n393\n449\n505\n561\n617\n673\n729\n785\n841\n897\n953\n1009\n1065\n1121\n1177\n1233\n\n0\n\nFigure 4 Autocorrelation of the d-sequence of 1277 with two different permutations on 58 blocks\nof size 22 digits each\nNext we consider four random permutations P1, P2, P3 and P4. We applied the permutations P1,\nP2, P3 and P4 on block1, block2, block3 and block4 of the d-sequence of period 1276. Then, we\napplied the same four permutations, P1, P2, P3 and P4 on block5, block6, block7 and block8\nrespectively and this process was repeated till the end of the 58 blocks.\n1.2\n1\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n\u20100.2\n\n1\n55\n109\n163\n217\n271\n325\n379\n433\n487\n541\n595\n649\n703\n757\n811\n865\n919\n973\n1027\n1081\n1135\n1189\n1243\n\n0\n\nFigure 5 Autocorrelation of the d-sequence of 1277 with four different permutations on its 58\nblocks of size 22 digits each\nSimilarly we considered five, six, seven, eight, nine and ten different permutations on the 58\nblocks of the d-sequence of 1277. As a final step, we generated 58 random permutations P1,\n5\n\n\fP2...P58 on block1, block2...block58 respectively.

Figure 9 shows the improvement factor of the d-sequence of 1787 where it is divided into\neven number of blocks that is 94 blocks of size 19 digits each.

Similar results are obtained for a random sequence that is\ngenerated on a Windows PC. The above graphs show that the improvement factor is quite\nimpressive if the block size is not too small. Several statistical tests of randomness [5] were\nperformed on the sequences and the results were supportive of the conclusion that the sequences\nare cryptographically strong.\nConclusion\nWe show that permutations on blocks of random sequences improve their randomness. The\nimprovement presented in the graphs is typical of the performance of d-sequences. The specific\nconclusion is that two or three permutations on blocks that are not too small suffice to improve\nthe autocorrelation function of the sequence.\n\nReferences\n[1]\n\n[2]\n[3]\n\nC. H.
