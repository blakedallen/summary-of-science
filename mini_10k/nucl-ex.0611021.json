Near the\n4\u03b1 breakup threshold of 14.4 MeV, a broad peak is observed at an excitation energy\nof 13.6\u00b10.2 MeV with a width of 0.6\u00b10.2 MeV. The spin-parity is estimated to be 0+\nfrom the momentum-transfer dependence. The observed width is significantly larger\nthan those of the neighboring 0+ states indicating a state with a well-developed \u03b1\ncluster structure. The magnitude of the cross section is sensitive to the density\ndistribution of the constituent \u03b1 clusters. The observed cross section is consistent\nwith the theoretical prediction for the \u03b1 cluster condensed state characterized by\nits dilute density distribution with a large root-mean-square radius of about 4.3 fm.\n\nPreprint submitted to Elsevier Science\n\n20 September 2018\n\n\fKey words: (\u03b1, \u03b1\u2032 ) scattering, \u03b1 cluster condensation,\nPACS: 25.55.Ci, 21.60.Gx, 27.20.+n\n\nIn the last decade, Green's function Monte Carlo (GFMC) calculations have\nsuccessfully reproduced ground and low-lying excited state energies of light nuclei up to A = 10 [1,2,3] with an accuracy of 1\u20132% using realistic two-nucleon\n[4] and three-nucleon potentials [5,6]. One of the most impressive results of\nthese so-called first-principles calculations for A = 8 is that the intrinsic density distribution for the ground state of 8 Be has two peaks representing a 2\u03b1\ncluster structure [1]. These two clusters are separated by about 4 fm, and thus\nthey form a dilute system. It is natural to expect that there are also loosely\nbound dilute states with 3\u03b1 and 4\u03b1 clusters as excited states in 12 C and 16 O,\nrespectively. For 12 C, several 3\u03b1 cluster calculations [7,8,9] almost a quarter\ncentury ago have shown that the second 0+ state has a larger root-mean-square\n(rms) radius than the ground state by about 1 fm. These results imply that\nthis 0+ state has a gas-like structure of 3\u03b1 clusters predominantly in relative\nS waves [10,11].\nRecently, using a new \u03b1 cluster wave function, a 4\u03b1 cluster state of dilute\ndensity has been theoretically predicted in 16 O near the 4\u03b1 breakup threshold\n[12]. The same wave function has also been used to predict a 3\u03b1-cluster state\nwith dilute density in 12 C near the 3\u03b1 breakup threshold [12,13], and there\nare strong indications [14] that the second 0+ state is this state. This new \u03b1\ncluster wave function can represent a condensation of \u03b1 clusters in a spherically\nsymmetric state. Because the \u03b1 cluster is a boson, an excited state with dilute\ndensity composed of weakly interacting \u03b1 clusters in relative S waves can\nbe considered as a \u03b1 cluster condensed (ACC) state. This idea is based on\ntheoretical investigations on the possibility of \u03b1 particle condensation in lowdensity nuclear matter [15]. It should be noted that, in the case of finite selfconjugate 4n nuclei, coherent phenomena such as super-fluidity observed in a\nBose\u2013Einstein condensed state are not expected to occur since n is very small,\ne.g., n = 3 in 12 C. Nevertheless the idea of \u03b1 cluster condensation in nuclei\nis very important since the ACC state does seem to exist in self-conjugate\nn\u03b1 nuclei [12,16]. Therefore, it is very important to search for and investigate\nthe theoretically predicted 4\u03b1 cluster condensed state in 16 O. In this Letter\nwe report experimental evidence for a broad 0+ state at an excitation energy\nof Ex = 13.6 \u00b1 0.1 MeV with a width of \u0393 = 0.6 \u00b1 0.2 MeV which can be\ninterpreted as being the predicted exotic ACC state.\nMeasurements were carried out using the West\u2013South Beam Line (WS-BL)\n[17] and the Grand Raiden (GR) spectrometer [18] at the Research Center for\nNuclear Physics, Osaka University. The WS-BL provides a double-achromatic\nEmail address: wakasa@phys.kyushu-u.ac.jp (T. Wakasa).\n\n2\n\n\fbeam with zero lateral and angular dispersions. The beam energy was T\u03b1 = 400\nMeV (100 MeV/A) and its energy spread was 108 keV. The beam bombarded\na windowless and self-supporting ice (H2 O) target [19] with a thickness of 9\nmg/cm2 . The thickness was determined by comparing the elastic yield from\nthe SiO2 target with a thickness of 2.0 mg/cm2 . Scattered \u03b1 particles from\nthe target were momentum analyzed by the high-resolution GR spectrometer\nwith a typical resolution of about 160 keV FWHM. The yields of the scattered\n\u03b1 particles were extracted using the peak-shape fitting program allfit [20].\nThe elastic differential cross sections of 16 O are shown in Fig. 1. The data\ndecrease almost monotonically as a function of momentum transfer over a\nmomentum-transfer region up to 4.7 fm\u22121 . The data were analyzed by a phenomenological optical model potential (OMP). We adopt the single-folding\nmodel based on the nucleon\u2013\u03b1 interaction, in which an empirical nucleon\u2013\u03b1\npotential [21] is folded with the nucleon density of 16 O. Note that the resulting\nOMP is a complex potential because the nucleon\u2013\u03b1 potential is complex. The\nsolid curve in Fig. 1 shows the result using the OMP generated by the folding.\nThe single-folding potential reproduces the data well up to qc.m. \u2248 3 fm\u22121 and\nslightly underestimates the data for qc.m. & 3 fm\u22121 . This underestimation is\nbelieved to be due to the energy dependence of the nucleon\u2013\u03b1 interaction and\ncould be resolved by adjusting the parameters of the single-folding potential.\nHowever, in the following, we use the OMP for the analysis of the ACC without modification because the ACC data have been measured only up to qc.m.\n\u2248 2.3 fm\u22121 where the elastic data are well reproduced by this OMP.\nFigure 2(a) shows the excitation energy spectrum of 16 O(\u03b1, \u03b1\u2032) scattering including \u03b8c.m. = 0\u25e6 . The effects of the finite solid angle of GR have been taken\ninto account in all the momentum transfer qc.m. values reported here. For\nFig. 2(a), qc.m. \u2243 0.2 fm\u22121 is obtained. At this small qc.m. , the J \u03c0 = 0+ state at\nEx = 12.0 MeV is the most prominent peak and the J \u03c0 = 2+ state at Ex = 11.5\nMeV also forms a prominent peak. Both broad peaks at Ex \u2243 13.0 and 14.0\nMeV consist of several peaks. An ACC state is expected to be in this region.\nWe performed peak fitting using allfit to find evidence of the ACC state.\nIn the peak fitting, the narrow peaks of 16 O were described by a standard\nhyper-Gaussian line shape and the peaks with intrinsic widths were described\nas Lorentzian shapes convoluted with a resolution function based on the narrow peaks. The positions and widths were taken from Ref. [22]. It was found\nthat the region below Ex \u2243 13 MeV is well reproduced in the peak fitting,\nwhereas the region around Ex \u2243 13.6 MeV is significantly under-predicted\nbecause there is no known state in this region [22]. The under-prediction is\ncommon at all momentum transfers and indicates the existence of a new state\nin this region.\nA wavelet analysis technique was employed to investigate the structure of the\nnew state. This technique has been developed in signal theory [23] and has\n3\n\n\falso been used in nuclear physics for the extraction of characteristic scales in\nthe fine structure of giant resonances [24,25]. The excitation energy spectrum\n\u03c3(E) was folded with a chosen wavelet function \u03a8 and the coefficients\nC(Ex , \u2206E) = \u221a\n\n1\n\u2206E\n\nZ\n\n\u03c3(E)\u03a8\n\n\u0012\n\nE \u2212 Ex\ndE\n\u2206E\n\u0013\n\n(1)\n\nwere obtained in the continuum wavelet transform (CWT), where Ex is the\nexcitation energy and \u2206E is the scale parameter of \u03a8. We used the Morlet\ntype function consisting of a cosine function with a Gaussian envelope,\n1\nx2\n\u03a8(x) = \u221a\ncos(kx)\nexp\n\u2212\n4\n\u03c0\n2\n\n!\n\n,\n\nk=\n\n5\n2\u03c0\n\n(2)\n\nwhich is often used for the wavelet function [24,25].\nFigures 2(b)\u2013(d) show the results of CWT for the data at qc.m. = 0.2 fm\u22121 .\nThe correlation of the wavelet coefficients C in Eq. (1) is displayed in Fig. 2(b)\nas functions of Ex and \u2206E. For the bumps at Ex \u2243 13.0 and 14.0 MeV\nconsisting of several peaks, two maxima at scales of about 0.1 and 0.7 MeV\nare observed. The larger value corresponds to the total width of the bumps\nand the smaller value reflects the width of the constituent peaks as determined\nby the experimental energy resolution. These results indicate that the CWT\ntechnique can be applied to the investigation of the fine structure of the bump\nexcited by (\u03b1, \u03b1\u2032) scattering. Figure 2(c) shows C at a scale of 0.12 MeV as a\nfunction of excitation energy. The structures of the Morlet type function are\nclearly found at Ex \u2248 9.8, 11.5, and 12.0 MeV, which correspond to the known\nstates with J \u03c0 = 2+ , 2+ , and 0+ , respectively. An uneven structure of C is\nidentified at Ex & 13 MeV, displayed magnified in Fig. 2(d). The structure\nat Ex \u2243 13.6 MeV indicates the existence of the new state because there is\nno known state in this region. The observed structure is well reproduced by\nassuming the excitation energy of the new state to be Ex = 13.6 MeV, as\nshown by the dashed curve in Fig. 2(d). The reproducibility is sensitive to the\nexcitation energy of the new state and thus the uncertainty is estimated to be\n\u00b10.1 MeV. It is rather difficult to determine the width of the new state from\nthe results of CWT because of interference from the neighboring bumps at Ex\n\u2243 13.0 and 14.0 MeV.\nIn order to deduce the width of the new state, we performed peak fitting in this\nregion by adding the new state at Ex = 13.6 MeV, and determined its width so\nas to reproduce the experimental data. Figure 3 shows the results of the fitting\nat qc.m. = 0.2 fm\u22121 for \u0393 = 0.3, 0.6, and 0.9 MeV. The dashed curves represent\nthe fits to the individual peaks while the straight line and solid curve represent\nthe background and the sum of the peak fitting, respectively. In the case of \u0393\n= 0.3 MeV, the region around the new state could not be well reproduced, and\nin the case of \u0393 = 0.9 MeV, the region at Ex \u2243 14.4 MeV is overestimated.\n4\n\n\fThe best reproduction is achieved for \u0393 = 0.6 MeV and its uncertainty is\nestimated to be about 0.2 MeV, calculated considering this result and the\nuncertainty of the excitation energy. We also performed peak fitting for other\nmomentum-transfer data; the results are displayed in Fig. 4 for qc.m. \u2243 0.2,\n0.5, and 1.2 fm\u22121 . At all momentum transfers, reasonable reproduction of the\ndata is achieved by including the new state at Ex = 13.6 \u00b1 0.1 MeV with \u0393 =\n0.6 \u00b1 0.2 MeV.\nIt should be noted that the width \u0393 = 0.6 \u00b1 0.2 MeV of the new state is\nsignificantly larger than that of the neighboring 0+ states at Ex = 12.0 and\n14.0 MeV, with \u0393 = 1.5 and 185 keV [22], respectively. A recent theoretical\ninvestigation with the new \u03b1 cluster wave function predicts the ACC state of\n16\nO to be Ex \u2248 14.1 MeV and \u0393 \u2248 1.5\u20131.9 MeV [26]. Quantitative comparisons\nbetween experimental and theoretical results are rather difficult due to the\nparameter dependence of the theoretical predictions. However, the calculations\nshow qualitatively that the ACC state should be around the 4\u03b1 break-up\nthreshold of 14.4 MeV with a significantly large \u0393 compared with those of\nthe 0+ states described in the shell model. The ACC state is characterized\nby the diluteness of the constituent \u03b1 clusters, and this diluteness results in\nthe large \u0393 value of the ACC. The observed new state is consistent with this\ntheoretical prediction for the ACC. Note that the transition form factor to the\nACC is almost independent of the parameters [26]. Thus, in the following, a\nqualitative comparison is made of the cross section in order to confirm that\nthe new state is the ACC.\nFigure 5 shows the cross section of the new state at Ex = 13.6 MeV as a\nfunction of momentum transfer. The error bars include both statistical and\nsystematic uncertainties of the data, with the systematic uncertainties being\ndominant. The systematic uncertainties are estimated by taking into account\nthe uncertainties of both the excitation energy and the width of the new state.\nThe data cover a momentum-transfer region up to about 2.3 fm\u22121 , and have\na maximum at qc.m. = 0.2 fm\u22121 (\u03b8c.m. \u2248 0\u25e6 ). This forward-peaking of the cross\nsection indicates that the transferred angular momentum L is 0 and the spin\nparity of the new state is 0+ by considering the spin-scalar and isospin-scalar\nnature of (\u03b1, \u03b1\u2032). We compare our cross section with a microscopic coupledchannel (MCC) calculation for the ACC state. The OMP is the same as that\nused for the analysis of the elastic scattering data, and the transition form factor is obtained using the ACC wave function described in Ref. [26]. The solid\ncurve in Fig. 5 is the result of the calculation and reproduces the experimental data well without normalization. It should be noted that the magnitude\nof the form factor is sensitive to the rms radius of the ACC state, whereas\nits radial dependence is insensitive to the rms radius [26]. Therefore, for the\ncorresponding cross section in (\u03b1, \u03b1\u2032), the rms radius should be investigated\nthrough its magnitude rather than its momentum-transfer dependence [27].\nSince we have used an OMP that reproduces the elastic scattering data well,\n5\n\n\fwe can compare the absolute values of both the experimental and theoretical\nresults. The good theoretical reproduction without any normalization shows\nthat the rms radius of the new state is consistent with that of the ACC state\nused in the calculation. Therefore, the rms radius could be estimated to be\nsame as the theoretical value of about 4.3 fm [26], which is significantly larger\nthan that of the ground state of 16 O of 2.7 fm. This large rms radius is due to\nthe diluteness of the \u03b1 clusters, and thus the new state can be interpreted as\nbeing the ACC state characterized by its dilute density distribution.\nIn conclusion, we have searched for evidence of the ACC state in 16 O in\n16\nO(\u03b1, \u03b1\u2032) scattering at 400 MeV using an ice target. A broad peak was found\nat Ex = 13.6\u00b10.1 MeV with \u0393 = 0.6\u00b10.2 and its spin-parity J \u03c0 was estimated\nto be 0+ from the momentum-transfer dependence. The excitation energy is\nnear the 4\u03b1 breakup threshold of 14.4 MeV, whereas the width is significantly\nlarger than those of neighboring 0+ states. This large \u0393 indicates that the\n\u03b1 cluster structure is well-developed in the new state. The magnitude of the\ncross section is sensitive to the diluteness of the \u03b1 clusters. The observed cross\nsection, the excitation energy, and the width all strongly indicate the existence\nof an ACC state in 16 O, characterized by a large rms radius of about 4.3 fm\ncompared with that of the ground state of 2.7 fm.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge the dedicated efforts of the RCNP cyclotron crew for providing a good quality beam.
