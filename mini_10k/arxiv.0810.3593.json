General Relativity (GR) has stood as\na monument to the genius of Albert Einstein for almost a\ncentury. However, despite the astonishing observational\nand experimental success of this theory [1], there exist\nmany theoretical aspects which make us consider the\npossibility of departures from it in certain regimes. In\nfact, one would like to remove physically undesired\naspects such as the Big Bang or black hole singularities.\nThese are aspects which clearly point towards high energy modifications of the theory motivated by quantum\ngravity effects. On the other hand, the recently observed\ncosmic speedup [2] suggests that something is needed in\nthe Friedman-Robertson-Walker equations to account\nfor the apparent positive acceleration of the expansion\nrate. This requires a modification of the equations\nat low energies. It could come in the form of a new\nenergy source dominant over the other matter sources\nat very low densities [3], or as a modification of the field\nequations which would be suppressed above a certain\ncosmic curvature scale [4]. It is this latter possibility\nwhich has impulsed the study of modified theories of\ngravity of the f (R) type in the recent literature [5] (see\nalso [6]).\nWhen the Einstein-Hilbert lagrangian is promoted to a\nnon-linear function of the scalar curvature one is dealing\nwith an f (R) theory of gravity. When this is done,\none must specify whether the connection is still defined\nin terms of the metric as the Levi-Civita connection\n(metric formalism) or if it is an independent geometrical\nfield (Palatini formalism).\nOne should note that,\n\non pure geometrical grounds, metric and connection\nare completely independent and equally fundamental\nobjects. However, the literature has traditionally given\na dominant role to the metric over the connection. In\nthis paper we will focus on f (R) theories in Palatini\nformalism. In these theories, the field equations show\nthat the independent connection is not a dynamical\nfield in the sense that it does not satisfy an independent\nsecond-order partial differential equation. Instead, its\nfield equation can be solved in terms of an auxiliary\nmetric which is conformally related with the usual (or\nphysical or Jordan frame) metric. As we will see, the\nconformal factor is a local function of the trace, T , of the\nenergy-momentum tensor T\u03bc\u03bd of the matter. Thus, the\nindependent connection, despite being non-dynamical in\nthe usual sense, does mediate new interactions between\nthe matter and geometry. The resulting equations\nfor the metric can be written in Einstein form with a\nmodified right hand side in which the trace T plays a role\nnon-existing in GR. We will discuss later in depth the implications of such terms in the dynamics of these theories.\nThe goal of this paper is to contribute and shed some\nnew light on a problem discussed in recent literature\nthat seems to affect seriously the theoretical viability\nof all f (R) models in Palatini formalism. The problem\nconsists on the existence of curvature singularities near\nthe surface of spherically symmetric, static matter\nconfigurations with polytropic equation of state (EoS)\nand polytropic index within the range 3/2 < \u03b3 < 2. Its\nexistence and possible consequences were first reported\nby Barausse et al. in [7] using previous results of\nKainulainen et al. [8]. The problem was reconsidered\nby Kainulainen et al. in [9], where it was argued that\nthe singularities had more to do with the peculiarities\n\n\f2\nof the EoS used than with the theory of Palatini f (R)\ngravity. They found that for neutron stars the tidal\nacceleration due to the singularity becomes equal to the\nSchwarzschild value of GR only at a distance \u223c 0.3 fermi\nfrom the surface of the star, which makes unrealistic the\nuse of a polytropic EoS. However, Barausse et al. replied\nin [10] that the fluid approximation is still valid on the\nscale at which the tidal forces diverge just below the\nsurface of a polytropic sphere in the case of the generic\nfunctions f (R) considered.\nWe reconsider the problem and independently re-derive\nthe structure equations for spherically symmetric, static\nsystems. We study the physically admissible models\nf (R) = R \u00b1 \u03bbR2 , with \u03bb a constant of order the Planck\nlength squared, and estimate the density scale \u03c1s at\nwhich the potentially divergent terms become of order\nunity. We find that, for our choice of \u03bb, \u03c1s is well below\nany physically accessible density scale. In this case, one\ncan conclude that the mathematical singularity found\nin [7] and [10] is just an artifact due to the use of the\npolytropic EoS beyond its natural regime of validity.\nFor other choices of \u03bb, however, the singularity can\neffectively arise at densities sufficiently high as to admit\nthe validity of the polytropic EoS. Our approach and\nresults can thus be used to place bounds on the allowed\nrange of values of \u03bb and to constrain other f (R) models.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In section II we\npresent the action, derive the field equations, and discuss\ntheir physical properties and new aspects as compared\nto GR. Section III presents the structure equations for\na spherically symmetric, static matter configuration for\na generic, unspecified lagrangian f (R). In section IV we\nstudy the behavior of the metric near the surface for systems with polytropic EoS. We conclude with a summary\nand discussion.\nII.\n\nACTION AND FIELD EQUATIONS\n\nLet us begin by defining the action of Palatini theories\nZ\n\u221a\n1\nS[g, \u0393, \u03c8m ] = 2 d4 x \u2212gf (R) + Sm [g\u03bc\u03bd , \u03c8m ] (1)\n2\u03ba\nHere f (R) is a function of R \u2261 g \u03bc\u03bd R\u03bc\u03bd (\u0393), with R\u03bc\u03bd (\u0393)\ngiven by R\u03bc\u03bd (\u0393) = \u2212\u2202\u03bc \u0393\u03bb\u03bb\u03bd + \u2202\u03bb \u0393\u03bb\u03bc\u03bd + \u0393\u03bb\u03bc\u03c1 \u0393\u03c1\u03bd\u03bb \u2212 \u0393\u03bb\u03bd\u03c1 \u0393\u03c1\u03bc\u03bb\nwhere \u0393\u03bb\u03bc\u03bd is the connection. The matter action Sm depends on the matter fields \u03c8m , the metric g\u03bc\u03bd , which\ndefines the line element ds2 = g\u03bc\u03bd dx\u03bc dx\u03bd , and its first\nderivatives (Christoffel symbols). The matter action does\nnot depend on the connection \u0393\u03bb\u03bc\u03bd , which is seen as an\nindependent field appearing only in the gravitational action (this condition is not essential and can be relaxed at\nthe cost of introducing a non-vanishing torsion). Varying\n(1) with respect to the metric g\u03bc\u03bd we obtain\n1\nf \u2032 (R)R\u03bc\u03bd (\u0393) \u2212 f (R)g\u03bc\u03bd = \u03ba2 T\u03bc\u03bd\n2\n\n(2)\n\nwhere f \u2032 (R) \u2261 df /dR. From this equation we see that\nthe scalar R can be solved as an algebraic function of the\ntrace T . This follows from the trace of (2)\nf \u2032 (R)R \u2212 2f (R) = \u03ba2 T,\n\n(3)\n\nThe solution to this algebraic equation will be denoted\nby R = R(T ). The variation of (1) with respect to \u0393\u03bb\u03bc\u03bd\nmust vanish independently of (2) and gives\n\u0014\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0012\n\u221a\n1\n1\n\u2212g \u03b4\u03bb\u03c1 f \u2032 g \u03bc\u03bd \u2212 \u03b4\u03bb\u03bc f \u2032 g \u03c1\u03bd \u2212 \u03b4\u03bb\u03bd f \u2032 g \u03bc\u03c1\n= 0 (4)\n\u2207\u0393\u03c1\n2\n2\nwhere \u2207\u0393\u03c1 is the derivative operator associated to \u0393 and\nf \u2032 \u2261 f \u2032 (R[T ]) is a function of the matter fields. This\nequation leads to\n\u0393\u03bb\u03bc\u03bd =\n\nt\u03bb\u03c1\n(\u2202\u03bc t\u03c1\u03bd + \u2202\u03bd t\u03c1\u03bc \u2212 \u2202\u03c1 t\u03bc\u03bd )\n2\n\n(5)\n\ndf\nwhere t\u03bc\u03bd \u2261 f \u2032 g\u03bc\u03bd , and f \u2032 \u2261 dR\n. Inserting this solution\nfor \u0393 into (2) we find the following modified Einstein\nequations\n\nG\u03bc\u03bd (g) =\n\nRf \u2032 \u2212 f\n1\n\u03ba2\nT\u03bc\u03bd \u2212\ng\u03bc\u03bd + \u2032 (\u2207\u03bc \u2207\u03bd f \u2032 \u2212 g\u03bc\u03bd \u0003f \u2032 )\n\u2032\nf\n2f \u2032\nf\n\u0012\n\u0013\n3\n1\n\u2212 \u20322 \u2202\u03bc f \u2032 \u2202\u03bd f \u2032 \u2212 g\u03bc\u03bd (\u2202f \u2032 )2\n(6)\n2f\n2\n\nwhere now \u2207\u03bc is the usual covariant derivative of g\u03bc\u03bd .\n\nA.\n\nPhysical aspects of the field equations\n\nFirst of all, it is important to note that the right hand\nside of (6) behaves like a modified energy-momentum\ntensor in which the trace T plays a role non-existing in\nGR via the terms R, f (R) and the various derivatives of\nf (R). Thus, though the equations for the metric are still\nsecond order, the dynamics in regions with pronounced\ngradients in the matter fields (\u2202f \u2032 and \u2207\u03bc \u2207\u03bd f \u2032 ) might\nconsiderably depart from that of standard GR. In\ncontrast, the vacuum solutions of these equations are\nexactly the same as in vacuum GR with a cosmological\nconstant.\nTo better understand the role of the gradients of f \u2032 in\n(6), it is useful to re-express the field equations in terms\nof the auxiliary metric t\u03bc\u03bd that defines the connection \u0393\nin (5). In terms of this metric, the equations become\nG\u03bc\u03bd (t) =\nThe\nand\n(7),\nThe\n\n\u03ba2\n[Rf \u2032 \u2212 f ]\nT\u03bc\u03bd \u2212\nt\u03bc\u03bd\n\u2032\nf\n2(f \u2032 )2\n\n(7)\n\nadvantage of using t\u03bc\u03bd is that the gradients \u2202\u03bc f \u2032\n\u2207\u03bc \u2207\u03bd f \u2032 present in (6) are completely absent in\nwhich allows for a better comparison with GR.\nstructure of these equations resembles that of GR\n\n\f3\n\u2032\n\n\u2212f ]\nplus a trace-dependent term [Rf\n2(f \u2032 )2 , which becomes a\ncosmological constant in vacuum. The solution for t\u03bc\u03bd\nwill thus involve integrals over the matter sources which,\nlike in GR, represent the fact that larger amounts of\nmatter contribute more to the curvature of space-time.\nWhat is then the role of the gradients \u2202\u03bc f \u2032 and \u2207\u03bc \u2207\u03bd f \u2032\nof (6)? The answer is simple: since the physical metric\nt\nis g\u03bc\u03bd = f\u03bc\u03bd\u2032 , the gradients of f \u2032 in (6) introduce a local\ndependence of the metric on the local matter-energy\ndistribution. The metric is not only determined by the\ntotal amount of matter, also the local matter-energy\ndensity affects its properties via f \u2032 (R(T )). This dependence on the local energy density distribution manifests\nitself with clarity in f (R) models sensitive to low energy\nscales. In particular, it has been shown that all such\nmodels would have dramatic effects for the stability\nof matter [11]. For the model f (R) = R \u2212 \u03bc4 /R,\nthe ground state of Hydrogen would desintegrate in\nless than two hours [12], which rules out that model\nand all models sensitive to ultra-low matter density\nscales. The reason for this has to do with the strong\ngravitational backreaction induced by f \u2032 near the zeros\nof the atomic wave functions, where the characteristic\nultra-low density scale \u03c1\u03bc \u2261 \u03bc2 /\u03ba2 \u223c 10\u221226 g/cm3\ncan be effectively reached. In fact, for atoms (and\nmany other not so small systems), the total amount of\nmatter is very small and leads to t\u03bc\u03bd \u2248 \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd . However,\nif f \u2032 is sensitive to ultra-low densities such as \u03c1\u03bc , the\nphysical metric g\u03bc\u03bd = \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd /f \u2032 departs from \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd when\nthe matter density me |\u03c8(x)|2 drops below \u03c1\u03bc . This\nis at the heart of the matter instabilities found in [11, 12].\n\nOn the other hand, the dependence of g\u03bc\u03bd on the local\nmatter-energy distribution also imposes constraints on\nthe sources. Since the Riemann tensor involves secondorder derivatives of the metric, it follows that a smooth\ngeometry must be one with continuous and differentiable\nf \u2032 up to second order, \u2202 2 g\u03bc\u03bd \u223c (\u2202 2 f \u2032 )t\u03bc\u03bd \u223c (\u2202f \u2032 )2 t\u03bc\u03bd ,\nwhich implies that T must be differentiable up to that\norder at least [17]. An immediate consequence of this\nrestriction is that the naive spherically symmetric constructions of GR with matter profile of the form\n\u03c1=\n\n\u001a\n\n\u03c10 if r < R0\n0 if r \u2265 R0\n\n(8)\n\nare, strictly speaking, not valid for a generic Palatini\nf (R). This idealized construction, used as such in [8],\ncan be easily adapted to Palatini f (R) by conveniently\nmodifying the density profile near the surface to smoothly\ninterpolate between the interior \u03c10 and the exterior vacuum. Otherwise, the discontinuous density profile would\nyield undesired singularities. Nonetheless, intuition tells\nus that such a refinement should be (from a practical\npoint of view) unnecessary for theories with high curvature corrections, for which the contribution to the metric\ndue to the matter contained in the outermost layers of the\nstar should be negligible and then one could effectively\n\nuse GR. However, it is precisely the existence of singularities on the surface of stellar objects that motivates\nthis paper. In the next sections we will study in detail\nthe properties and nature of such (highly unexpected and\ncounterintuitive) singularities.\nIII.\n\nSTELLAR STRUCTURE EQUATIONS\n\nUsing the following line element\nds2 = \u2212A(r)e2\u03c8(r) dt2 +\n\n1\ndr2 + r2 d\u03a92\nA(r)\n\n(9)\n\nwith A(r) = 1 \u2212 2M (r)/r, the combinations Gtt \u00b1 Grr of\n(6) lead to\n\"\n\u0012 \u00132 #\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u2032\n\u03ba2 (P + \u03c1)\n3 fr\u2032\nfrr\n2 fr\u2032\n(10)\n\u2212\n+ \u2032 \u03c8r =\n+\nr\nf\nf \u2032 A(r)\nf\u2032\n2 f\u2032\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0014 \u2032\n1 2 fr\u2032\n\u03ba2 (\u03c1 + V /2)\nf\n+ A(r) rr\u2032 \u2212 (11)\n+ \u2032 Mr =\nr r\nf\nf\u2032\nf\n#\n\u0012 \u2032 \u00132\n3 fr\nfr\u2032 [r \u2212 M (r)]\n\u2212\n+ \u2032\n4 f\u2032\nf r[r \u2212 2M (r)]\n\u2032\nwhere f \u2032 \u2261 df /dR, fr\u2032 \u2261 df \u2032 /dr, frr\n\u2261 d2 f \u2032 /dr2 , \u03c8r \u2261\nd\u03c8/dr, Mr \u2261 dM/dr, and V \u2261 Rf \u2032 \u2212 f .

Knowing the behavior of Pr ,\nit is easy to verify that fP\u2032 Pr , Prr , and fP\u2032 Prr are wellbehaved for \u03b3 < 2. However, the term fP\u2032 P Pr2 of (21)\nand (22) is problematic [18]. In fact, from (31) and (32)\nit follows that\n\u0012 \u0013(3\u22122\u03b3)/\u03b3\n2\n2 (1 \u2212 \u03b3)\nMtot\nP\nfP\u2032 P Pr2 \u2248 \u2213\n.\n\u03c1\u03bb (\u03b3K)2 r2 (r \u2212 2Mtot )2 K\n(35)\n\n\f5\nThis term diverges for \u03b3 > 3/2 when P \u2192 0. The\nexistence of this divergence was first reported in [7],\nwhere the matching conditions between the internal\nand the external (Schwarzschild) metric were analyzed.\nSince this term is contained in \u03c8r and Mr , and such\nterms appear in the definition of the Riemann tensor, it\nwas concluded that the geometry becomes singular near\nthe surface of polytropes with index 2 < \u03b3 < 3/2. Since\nthe physically interesting case \u03b3 = 5/3 (degenerate,\nnon-relativistic fermion gas) lies within this interval,\nthis result was regarded as a serious theoretical concern\nabout the viability of Palatini f (R) theories. We will\nstudy now whether the (mathematical) divergence found\nin (35) is physical or not and how stringent is its effect\non the viability of Palatini f (R) theories.\n\nto respect the symmetry of the problem) since its mere\npresence rises the average matter density 92 orders of\nmagnitude above the critical scale \u03c1s . Therefore, the existence of a curvature singularity at such extremely low\ndensities should be regarded as unphysical, as an artifact of the idealized equation of state used. One should\nhave in mind that an accurate EoS at laboratory densities\n(let alone at the density scale found here) is very complicated to derive, because electrostatic interactions and\nother subtle effects mask the simpler statistical effects of\nthe idealized Fermi gas approximation [13]. The polytropic EoS should therefore be used within its expected\nregime of validity.\nV.\n\nFirst of all, for the models considered here, the divergence of fP\u2032 P Pr2 is entirely due to the contribution coming\nfrom the polytropic equation of state. This can be seen\nfrom the definition of fP\u2032 P in (16) [or from (26) or (31)]\nsince d\u03c1/dP and d2 \u03c1/dP 2 diverge as P \u2192 0 irrespective of the function f (R). If d\u03c1/dP and d2 \u03c1/dP 2 were\nfinite as P \u2192 0, the divergence would not arise. Second,\na glance at the dimensionless (and exact) contribution\n\u03c1P P\n2\n\u2032\n2\n\u03c1\u03bb (\u03c1+P ) of fP P Pr indicates that this term is strongly\nsuppressed everywhere by the factor 1/\u03c1\u03bb \u223c 10\u221292 . (This\nalso happens with all other correcting terms, which indicates that for our Planck scale corrected theory the\ninterior structure of stars is virtually the same as in GR.\nIn [10], however, the value of \u03bb was chosen in such a way\nthat the interior of compact stars was indeed affected by\nthe full f (R) dynamics.) The exception occurs strictly in\nthe limit P \u2192 0. Re-expressing that dimensionless factor\nin terms of the density, we find\n(1 \u2212 \u03b3)c4 (3\u22122\u03b3)\n\u03c1P P\n(\u03c1 + P )2 \u2248\n\u03c1\n.\n\u03c1\u03bb\n\u03c1\u03bb (\u03b3K)2\n\n(36)\n\nSince for \u03b3 > 3/2 this term diverges as \u03c1 \u2192 0, it is worth\nlooking at the value at which it becomes of order unity.\nThis happens at \u03c1 = \u03c1s , where\n\u03c1s =\n\n\u0012\n\nK 2 \u03c1\u03bb\nc4\n\n1\n\u0013 3\u22122\u03b3\n\n.\n\n(37)\n\nFor non-relativistic neutrons, \u03c1 \u226a 6 * 1015 g/cm3 ,\nthe ideal Fermi gas approximation leads to a polytropic equation of state of index \u03b3 = 5/3 and K =\n8/3\n(32/3 \u03c0 4/3 /5)(~2 /mn ) \u2248 5 * 109 (in c.g.s. units), where\nmn is the neutron mass. The resulting \u03c1s is on the order of \u03c1s \u223c 10\u2212210 g/cm3 [19]. This density is, by far,\nwell below any physical density one can imagine. In fact,\nfor a free electron whose wave function is spread over\n3\nthe entire universe, the ratio me /RUniv\nis on the order\nof \u223c 10\u2212118 g/cm3 . This means that a single electron\noutside of this idealized polytrope is more than enough\nto cure this singularity (of course, we assume the electron wavefunction uniformly spread over a spherical shell\n\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nThis work was motivated by an extremely interesting\nand puzzling result: the existence of curvature singularities in regions of very low curvature affecting all families\nof f (R) lagrangians in Palatini formalism. If such singularities were physical, all f (R) lagrangians except that\nof Hilbert-Einstein should be ruled out. And that would\nbe so for arbitrarily small departures from f (R) = R.\nSuch a result would have had very strong physical consequences, since it would have singled out GR as the privileged f (R) lagrangian. Our analysis, however, shows\nthat the (mathematical) low density/curvature singularities found in [7] depend intimately on the particular EoS\nchosen and have different strength depending on the f (R)\nmodel chosen. In the model that we studied, characterized by the Planck length squared, a single electron would\nsuffice to cure all stellar singularities in the Universe.\nIf instead of the Planck length we had chosen a larger\nlength scale (smaller density scale \u03c1\u03bb ), the surface singularity could occur at higher densities, perhaps within\nthe regime of validity of the polytropic EoS, and could\nnot be removed by such simple means. In this sense, the\ndoubts raised in [7] and [10] about the viability of Palatini f (R) models are well justified. In those works, the\nvalue of \u03bb was chosen on phenomenological grounds to\nbe \u03bb = (0.15 km)2 , which leads to \u03c1\u03bb \u223c 2 * 1018 g/cm3 .\nThis density scale is enough to pass all solar system weak\nfield tests [14] since f \u2032 \u2248 1 to high accuracy everywhere.\nHowever, it leads to \u03c1s \u2248 4 * 1012 g/cm3 , which indicates\nthat the divergent terms of Mr and \u03c8r begin to grow well\nwithin the region of validity of the polytropic EoS. The\nstudy of polytropes carried out here and in [7] and [10]\ncan thus be used to place bounds on the parameter \u03bb\nof the model under consideration and also in other models. If, for instance, we assume that the polytropic EoS\nshould not be trusted below \u03c1s \u223c 10\u2212n g/cm3 , we find\nthat\n\u03bb \u226a 104\u2212n/3 cm2 ,\n\n(38)\n\nwhich places explicit constraints on the allowed values\nfor \u03bb.\n\n\f6\nTo conclude, the important point was to show that\nnot all lagrangians are ruled out by this theoretical\nexperiment with polytropes. We have confirmed that the\nsurface singularities exist, but their physical character\ndepends on the details of the model and, as expected,\nultraviolet corrections are allowed for suitable choices\nof parameters. In particular, Planck scale corrected\nmodels are save from such singularities. This is of\ngreat importance to the light of the recently discovered\nrelation existing between non-perturbative approaches\nto quantum gravity and Palatini f (R) theories [15]. It\nturns out that the only consistent homogeneous and\nisotropic cosmology that can be constructed using the\ntechniques of Loop Quantum Gravity and which is\nfree of the Big Bang singularity [16] can be put into\ncorrespondence with a Palatini f (R) lagrangian with\n\nultraviolet, Planck scale, corrections. This provides a\nfundamental and so far non-existing theoretical justification for Palatini f (R) theories, which have only been\nstudied on phenomenological grounds in relation with\nthe cosmic speedup. We hope that this new avenue\nof research helps us better understand the properties\nof quantum gravity and space-time near cosmological\nand black hole singularities using the more familiar\ntechniques of modified gravities.\n\n[1] Clifford M.
