In particular, ultracold atoms confined to optical lattice potentials have\nbeen shown to be perfectly suitable for implementing\nphysical models of fundamental interest not only to the\nfield of atomic physics but also to condensed matter\nphysics [1, 2]. Specific examples of a highly versatile\nmany-body system include Bose-Fermi mixtures in optical lattices, which have been used recently to analyze the\neffect of fermionic impurities on the superfluid to Mottinsulator transition [3\u20135]. A further experimental setup\nclosely related to condensed matter systems consists of\nultracold atoms in tilted optical lattice potentials. Several fundamental quantum mechanical processes related\nto nonequilibrium transport of particles have been observed in this setup such as, e.g., Landau-Zener tunneling [6], Bloch oscillations [7, 8], and processes analogous\nto photon-assisted tunneling [9].\nOf particular importance, collisionally induced transport of fermions confined to an optical lattice and coupled to an ultracold bosonic bath has been observed in\nan experimental setup of a similar type to the one considered in this article [10]. Furthermore, a closely related theoretical analysis of collision-induced atomic currents along a tilted optical lattice was provided by Ponomarev et al. [11] based on a random matrix approach. In\nessence it was pointed out in Ref. [11] that the atomic\ncurrent exhibits Ohmic and negative differential conductance (NDC).\nIn the present article we study a natural extension of\nthe mentioned experiments, namely lattice Bose-Fermi\nmixtures with the fermions confined to a tilted optical\npotential. Motivated by earlier considerations [12, 13] we\nshow that this system is highly appropriate for exploring\nthe effects of electron-phonon interactions on nonequilibrium electric transport through a conductor. Specifically, we demonstrate that electron-phonon resonances,\n\npredicted to exist in solids nearly 40 years ago [14\u201316], yet\nfor which there seems to be no conclusive experimental\nevidence [17, 18], can be realized using ultracold atoms.\n\nFIG. 1. (Color online) Fermions confined to a tilted potential\nV (x) form a Wannier-Stark ladder with a constant energy separation \u2206 between adjacent lattice sites. The fermion-boson\ninteraction enables phonon-assisted transitions from site i to\nj at the rate Wi\u2192j . The released energy (i \u2212 j)\u2206 is dissipated\nin the form of a phonon emitted into the superfluid.\n\nIn our model the fermions take the role of electrons,\nwhereas the bosons provide a nearly perfect counterpart\nto acoustic phonons in solids. The tilt imposed on the\nlattice potential of the fermions corresponds to an applied bias voltage to the system. The collisions between\nfermions and bosons result in fermion-phonon relaxation\nprocesses, which give rise to a net atomic current along\nthe tilted lattice potential [11, 13, 19], as illustrated in\nFig. 1. We show that in our case, where both the fermions\nand bosons are trapped in an optical lattice, phonon resonances in the atomic current occur. They arise as the\nmomentum of the phonon emitted in the relaxation process approaches a so-called Van Hove singularity [20] at\nthe upper edge of the phonon band. Moreover, we shall\nsee that phonon resonances, at least on the level of approximations made in this article, are also expected to\noccur in Bose-Bose mixtures [21].\n\n\f2\nThere are crucial advantages of our cold atom implementation over a solid-state system: First, neither impurities nor imperfections in the system suppress the resonances in the current [17] and hence fermion-phonon\nscattering is the only relaxation process, which can be\nfully controlled via the bosonic system parameters [5, 22].\nSecond, large lattice tilts can be achieved with an energy\nmismatch between neighboring fermion sites that exceeds\nthe bandwidth of both the fermions and the phonons.\nThis makes it possible to study the influence of the phonon density of states on the atomic current over the entire phonon band. In addition, it allows us to observe\nnegative differential conductance [11, 13, 19], which is\nrealized in a solid-state system with difficulty by resorting to semiconductor superlattices [15, 18, 23]. Last, the\nparameters of our system can be chosen to ensure that\nLandau-Zener tunneling to higher fermion bands-often\na significant effect in high field transport [18]-is negligible despite the large lattice tilts [13] justifying the use\nof a tight-binding framework.\nThe key experimental techniques required for our\nscheme are twofold: first, the independent trapping of\natoms of different species in species-specific optical lattice potentials [24, 25] and, second, the tunability of the\nboson-boson and boson-fermion interactions by Feshbach\nresonances [5, 26]. Also, we exploit the possibility of implementing low-dimensional systems by strongly increasing the depth of the optical potentials along specific directions. In this way effectively one-dimensional systems\ncan be realized by tightly confining atoms to an array of\ntubes [2].\nThe structure of this article is as follows: In Sec. II\nwe start from the Bose-Fermi Hubbard model and outline the effective description of the Bose-Fermi mixture in\nterms of Bogoliubov phonons and Wannier-Stark states.\nIn Sec. III we derive a general expression for the drift\nvelocity of the fermions and show that this expression\nencompasses the phenomena of negative differential conductance and phonon resonances. Section IV contains\nthe results of a near-exact numerical simulation of a realistic experimental procedure to determine the dependence of the atomic current on the lattice tilt. We end\nwith the conclusions in Sec. V.\n\nII.\n\nEFFECTIVE MODEL\n\nThe specific system we consider consists of a homogeneous, one-dimensional Bose-Fermi mixture of bosons\nand spin-polarized fermions, both trapped in separate optical lattice potentials. If the potentials are sufficiently\ndeep so that only the lowest Bloch band is occupied then\nthe Bose-Fermi mixture can be described by the BoseFermi Hubbard model [27]\n\u0124bf = \u2212 Jb\n\nX\n\n<i,j>\n\n\u00e2\u2020i \u00e2j \u2212 Jf\n\nX\n\n<i,j>\n\n\u0109\u2020i \u0109j +\n\nX\n\n(j\u2206)\u0109\u2020j \u0109j\n\nj\n\nX \u2020 \u2020\n1 X \u2020 \u2020\n\u00e2j \u00e2j \u0109j \u0109j ,\n\u00e2j \u00e2j \u00e2j \u00e2j + Ubf\n+ Ub\n2\nj\nj\n\n(1)\n\nFIG. 2.

The\noperators \u00e2\u2020j (\u00e2j ) create (annihilate) a boson and, similarly, the operators \u0109\u2020j (\u0109j ) create (annihilate) a spinless fermion in a Wannier state localized at site j. The\nbosonic and fermionic hopping parameters are Jb and\nJf , respectively, and the on-site boson-boson and bosonfermion interactions are characterized by the energies\nUb and Ubf , both positive and independently tunable.\nIn contrast to the bosons, the lattice potential of the\nfermions is assumed to be tilted with an energy splitting \u2206 \u2265 0 between adjacent sites.\nAt low temperatures and for sufficiently small bosonboson interactions Ub /Jb \u223c 1 most bosons are in the superfluid phase and accurately described by the phononic\nexcitations of the superfluid. This description is obtained\nby transferring the bosonic part of the Hamiltonian \u0124bf\ninto momentum space and adopting the Bogoliubov approach [28], which results in the phonon Hamiltonian\n\u0124ph =\n\nX\n\nh\u0304\u03c9q b\u0302\u2020q b\u0302q .\n\n(2)\n\nq\n\nHere, q is the momentum running over the first Brillouin zone, i.e., \u2212\u03c0/a < q \u2264 \u03c0/a with a the lattice\nspacing, and the bosonic operators b\u0302\u2020q (b\u0302q ) create (annihilate) a Bogoliubov phonon. The excitation spectrum\nof the phonons\npis given by the Bogoliubov dispersion relation h\u0304\u03c9q = Eq (Eq + 2Ub nb ), where nb is the bosonic\noccupation number and Eq = 4Jb sin2 (qa/2) is the dispersion relation of noninteracting bosons in the optical\nlattice. The dispersion of the Bogoliubov phonons, albeit not identical, is remarkably similar to the dispersion of acoustic phonons in a solid-state system with\nh\u0304\u03c9q \u223c | sin(qa/2)|, shown in Fig. 2(a). The common features are a linear dispersion in the limit q \u2192 0 and the\nband structure with a gap at the boundary of the first\nBrillouin zone. It should be pointed out that the accuracy of the Bogoliubov description of phonons has been\n\n\f3\ndemonstrated experimentally [22], thus we have perfect\nknowledge of and control over the phonons in our system.\nThe fermions confined to the tilted potential are represented by the eigenstates of the fermionic part of \u0124bf ,\ni.e., the Wannier-Stark states [29, 30]. The unitary transformation that relates the Wannier operators \u0109j to the\nWannier-Stark operators d\u02c6j is given by\nX\nJi\u2212j (2Jf /\u2206)\u0109i ,\n(3)\nd\u02c6j =\ni\n\nwhere Jn (z) are Bessel functions of the first kind [31].\nIt follows immediately from the properties of the Bessel\nfunctions Jn (z) that the Wannier-Stark states are centered at lattice site j and have a width of the order of\nJf /\u2206.P By invoking the identities for the Bessel functions n Jn\u2212m (z)Jn\u2212m\u2032 (z) = \u03b4m,m\u2032 and (2n/z) Jn (z) =\nJn+1 (z) + Jn\u22121 (z) one finds that the transformed\nfermionic part of \u0124bf takes the diagonal form\nX\n(4)\n(j\u2206)d\u02c6\u2020j d\u02c6j .\n\u0124ws =\nj\n\nThe spectrum of \u0124ws constitutes a so-called WannierStark ladder [29, 30] with a constant energy separation \u2206\nbetween adjacent sites, shown in Fig. 1. We emphasize\nthat the Wannier-Stark states are stationary and hence\na net current of fermions along the tilted lattice only\ndevelops in presence of additional relaxation processes.\nIn particular, it results from the inverse of the transformation in Eq. (3) that a fermion initially localized at a\nsingle lattice site undergoes coherent Bloch oscillations\nwith frequency \u2206/h\u0304 [7].\nTo rewrite the boson-fermion interaction in terms of\nBogoliubov phonons and Wannier-Stark states we apply\nthe same transformations as for the purely bosonic and\nfermionic parts of \u0124bf . Invoking the results established\nin Refs. [28, 29] we find the fermion-phonon interaction\nHamiltonian\ni\nXh\nX \u2020\nd\u02c6j d\u02c6j +\nfq,l b\u0302q e\u2212iqaj + h.c. d\u02c6\u2020j+l d\u02c6j\n\u0124int = Ubf nb\nj\n\nj,l,q\n\n(5)\nwith the corresponding matrix elements\n\u0013\n\u00131/2 \u0012\n\u0012\n4Jf\nqa l \u2212iqal/2\nnb Eq\nie\n, (6)\nsin\nJl\nfq,l = Ubf\nN h\u0304\u03c9q\n\u2206\n2\nwhere N is the number of lattice sites. We note that \u0124int\ncoincides exactly with the description of the electronphonon interactions in a solid-state system [29] and thus\nis perfectly adequate for investigating related phonon effects.\nThe fermion-phonon interaction \u0124int describes the creation of a Bogoliubov phonon out of the superfluid phase\nand the reverse process, both caused by the hopping process of the fermions. These incoherent processes involving a single phonon enable fermions to make transitions\nbetween Wannier-Stark states separated by l lattice sites.\nOn the other hand, coherent processes resulting from\n\n\u0124int , in which a virtual phonon is emitted and reabsorbed, lead to a phonon-mediated fermion-fermion interaction, a renormalized fermion hopping and a mean-field\nenergy shift of the fermions [12, 13].\nThe effective fermion-fermion interaction, being short\nrange, can be safely neglected if we assume a filling\nfactor of the fermions much lower than 1. However,\nwe have to take into account the renormalization of\nthe fermion hopping Jf when comparing our theoretical model to experimental or numerical results. As expected from theoretical considerations [12, 13] and confirmed by the numerical results in Sec. IV, the renormalization reduces the bare hopping. Last, P\nthe mean-field\nenergy shift is explicitly given by Ubf nb + q |fq,0 |2 /h\u0304\u03c9q ,\nwhich is readily determined in the regime Ub nb /Jb \u226a 1\nby taking the continuum limit [32]. For a single delocalized fermion with Jf /\u2206 \u226b 1 the shift is simply Ubf nb ,\nwhereas for a localized fermion with Jf /\u2206\n\u221a \u226a 1 we find\nUbf nb (1 \u2212 aUbf /2h\u0304cs ), with cs = (a/h\u0304) 2Jb Ub nb the\nspeed of sound in the superfluid.\nIt is essential for our model that neither interactions\nwith the fermions nor the trapping potential confining the\nfermions destroy the phononic excitations of the superfluid. These conditions are met by using species-specific\noptical lattice potentials [24, 25] and by limiting the number of fermions in the system [3\u20135]. Moreover, we restrict\nour analysis to fermions moving slower than superfluid\ncritical velocity, which is cs according to Landau's criterion [33], to avoid excitations other than those caused by\nthe hopping transitions. More precisely we consider the\nparameter regime \u03b6 = 2aJf /h\u0304cs \u226a 1, where 2aJf /h\u0304 is\nthe maximal group velocity of the fermions in the lowest\nBloch band.\nIII.\n\nATOMIC CURRENTS\n\nSince the number of fermions is significantly smaller\nthan number of bosons we effectively treat the superfluid\nas a phonon bath. Accordingly we describe the dynamics\nof the fermions by a master equation for the probabilities Pj that a fermion occupies a Wannier-Stark state at\nsite j. The master equation reads\nX\n[Pj (1 \u2212 Pi )Wj\u2192i \u2212 Pi (1 \u2212 Pj )Wi\u2192j ] , (7)\n\u2202t Pi =\nj\n\nwhere Wi\u2192j are the rates for a phonon-assisted transition\nfrom site i to site j and the factors (1\u2212Pj ) take the Pauli\nexclusion principle into account. The probabilities Pi either describe the occupation of a single fermion or the\ndistribution\nP of an ensemble of fermions; in both cases we\nchoose j Pj = 1. The average position x\u0304 of the fermions\nP\nat time t is accordingly x\u0304 =\nj (aj)Pj and the average drift velocity v\u0304d , which quantifies theP\natomic current\nalong the lattice, is given by v\u0304d = \u2202t x\u0304 = j (aj)\u2202t Pj .\nTo obtain a useful expression for the drift velocity v\u0304d\nwe exploit the fact that the system is homogeneous so\nthat the transition rates Wi\u2192j only depend on the jump\ndistance l = i \u2212 j, where jumps with l > 0 are defined\n\n\f4\nto be downward the tilted lattice, as depicted in Fig. 1.\nBy using Fermi's golden rule based on the interaction\nHamiltonian \u0124int , i.e., to second order in the coupling\nUbf , we find\n2\u03c0 X\n|fq,l |2 (Nq + 1) \u03b4 (h\u0304\u03c9q \u2212 l\u2206) ,\nh\u0304 q\n2\u03c0 X\n|fq,l |2 Nq \u03b4 (h\u0304\u03c9q \u2212 l\u2206) ,\n=\nh\u0304 q\n\nWlE =\nWlA\n\n(8)\n\nwhere Nq = (eh\u0304\u03c9q /kB T \u2212 1)\u22121 is the mean number of\nphonons with momentum q in the superfluid at temperature T and kB is Boltzmann's constant. The rate\nWlE (WlA ) corresponds to the process, where a fermion\njumps l sites down (up) the lattice and thereby emits (absorbs) a single phonon of energy l\u2206. The expressions for\nthe jump rates WlE and WlA are valid as long as heating\neffects caused by the emitted phonons are negligible.\nTo determine v\u0304d in terms of transition rates we substitute the expression in Eq. (7) for \u2202t Pj and find after\nsome rearrangement that\nX\n\u0003\n\u0002\nv\u0304d =\n(al) Wl0 Pj (1 \u2212 Pj+l ) \u2212 WlA Pj (Pj+l \u2212 Pj\u2212l )\nj,l>0\n\n(9)\nwith\n= (2\u03c0/h\u0304) q |fq,l | \u03b4 (h\u0304\u03c9q \u2212 l\u2206) the phonon\nemission rate at zero temperature. The first term in the\nsum in Eq. (9) vanishes if the fermions are degenerate\nat zero temperature with all lattice sites j \u2265 jc occupied, i.e., Pj = 1 for j \u2265 jc and Pj = 0 for j < jc with jc\nfixed by the number of fermions, whereas the second term\nrepresents finite temperature effects. For the system far\nfrom degeneracy and for small fermion occupation numbers we may make\nthe approximation Pi PjP\u2248 0 and use\nP\nthe condition j Pj = 1, which yields v\u0304d = l>0 (al) Wl0\nfor the drift velocity. We note that at this level of approximation the expression for the drift velocity and all\nsubsequent analytical considerations apply, mutatis mutandis, also to lattice Bose-Bose mixtures [21].\nTaking the continuum limit of the sum over all phonon\nmomenta (appearing in Wl0 ) and integrating over the first\nBrillouin zone we finally obtain\nWl0\n\nv\u0304d =\n\nP\n\n2\n\nlmax\n\u2202h\u0304\u03c9q\na2 N X\nl\nh\u0304\n\u2202q\nl>0\n\n\u22121\n\n|fq,l |2\n\n,\n\n(10)\n\nq=ql\n\np\nwith ql implicitly defined by Eql = (l\u2206)2 + (Ub nb )2 \u2212\nUb nb . The latter relation also yields the maximum jump\ndistance lmax , which is compatible with energy conservation in the fermion-phonon relaxation process. We see\nfrom Eq. (10) that the total drift velocity v\u0304d is determined by the sum over all admissible jump distances l\nweighted by the phonon density of states |\u2202h\u0304\u03c9q /\u2202q|\u22121\nand the fermion-phonon coupling |fq,l |2 .\nWe first determine the mobility \u03bc of the fermions in the\nOhmic regime, which we define by the relation v\u0304d = \u03bc\u03b4 in\nthe limit \u03b4 \u2192 0, where \u03b4 = \u2206/4Jb is approximately the\nratio of the lattice tilt and the phonon bandwidth for the\n\nFIG. 3. (Color online) The total drift velocity v\u0304d (full line)\nas a function of the lattice tilt \u03b4 = \u2206/4Jb . The contributions from different jump distances l (dashed lines) result in a distinct NDC peak and a series of phonon resonances at the positions \u03b4 \u2248 1/l. The system parameters are\nUb nb /Jb = 0.5, Jf /Jb = 0.4 yielding for the phonon bandwidth 1.12 \u00d7 4Jb and \u03b6 = 0.5. The drift velocity is given in\n2\nunits of v\u03040 = anb Ubf\n/4Jb h\u0304.\n\nsmall values\nP\u221e of Ub nb /Jb we consider here. We find that\nv\u0304d /\u03b4 \u221d l=1 l2 Jl2 (l \u03b6) for \u03b4 \u2192 0, with \u03b6 = 2aJf /h\u0304cs\nas previously defined. This sum is a Kapteyn series of\nthe second kind, for which a closed form is known [31],\nyielding for the mobility\n2\naUbf\n\u03bc= \u221a\n8 2 Ub h\u0304\n\n\u0012\n\nJb\nU b nb\n\n\u00131/2\n\n\u03b6 2 (\u03b6 2 + 4)\n.\n(1 \u2212 \u03b6 2 )7/2\n\n(11)\n\nThe mobility diverges in the limit \u03b6 \u2192 1, however, it is\nwell defined in the regime \u03b6 \u226a 1. For the practically important case, where the potential depth for the fermions\nand hence the hopping parameter Jf is varied, the mobility scales as \u03bc \u223c Jf2 in the limit Jf \u2192 0.\nThe dependence of the drift velocity v\u0304d given in\nEq. (10) on the full range of accessible lattice tilts \u03b4 is\nshown in Fig. 3. We see that the atomic current makes a\nsharp transition from Ohmic conductance to negative differential conductance. The main reason is that the width\nof the Wannier-Stark states, proportional to Jf /\u2206, and\nhence the overlap between states at different sites decreases as the tilt \u2206 is increased. This reduced overlap\nresults in a low drift velocity v\u0304d -in analogy to NDC in\nsemiconductor superlattices [15, 18]-and is determined\nby the matrix elements fq,l . The drift velocity v\u0304d depends on the tilt as (Jf /\u2206)2l for each jump distance l in\nthe limit of small fermionic bandwidth Jf /\u2206 \u226a 1, which\ncan be readily achieved in cold atom systems. As can\nbe seen in Fig. 3 the NDC is particularly pronounced\ndue to the superposed contributions from different jump\ndistances l to the total current. These findings are in\naccordance with predictions for a free homogeneous superfluid [11, 13, 19], however, the result for v\u0304d in Eq. (10)\ndescribes additional features stemming from the influence\nof the phonon density of states.\n\n\f5\nSpecifically, the drift velocity exhibits anomalies in\nthe form of sharp peaks, which correspond to the anticipated electron-phonon resonances in a solid-state system [14, 16]. As shown in Fig. 2(b), the phonon density\nof states |\u2202h\u0304\u03c9q /\u2202q|\u22121 is approximately constant for small\nmomenta, but exhibits a Van Hove singularity [20] at the\nedge of the first Brillouin zone. Therefore phonon resonances arise as the momentum of the emitted phonons\napproaches the edge of the phonon band. It can be found\nfrom p\nEq. (10) that the resonance condition is given by\nl\u03b4 = 1 + Ub nb /2Jb with l = 1, 2, . . . , lmax and thus the\ncurrent displays a peak at \u03b4 \u2248 1/l corresponding to each\nadmissible jump distance l. Since the fermion-phonon\ninteraction provides the only relaxation process in the\nsystem these anomalies are directly reflected in the tilt\ndependence of the current. Further, the current vanishes\nas the lattice tilt exceeds the phonon bandwidth because\nthere are no phonon states available in order to dissipate\nenergy into the superfluid.\nLet us briefly discuss the effect of an additional (shallow) harmonic trapping potential of the bosons on the\nphonon resonances. If the system is aligned along the\nx-axis the potential takes the form V (x) = mb \u03c9x2 x2 /2\nwith the trap frequency \u03c9x . In the experimentally relevant\ncase, where the harmonic oscillator length lx =\np\nh\u0304/mb \u03c9x satisfies the condition lx /N \u226b nb a, the local density approximation (LDA) is applicable [27, 34].\nThe LDA consists of replacing the bosonic density nb\nby the position-dependent density nb (x), determined by\nV (x), with the other parameters of the model unmodified. Consequently, the averageRdrift velocity in Eq. (10)\nhas to be replaced by v\u0304dLDA = dx p(x)v\u0304d [nb (x)], where\np(x) denotes the normalized spatial distribution of the\nfermions. This averaging might cause some broadening\nof the phonon resonances.\nHowever, the position of the\np\nresonances \u03b4 = l\u22121 1 + Ub nb /2Jb and more generally v\u0304d\n(except for the prefactor v\u03040 ) depend on nb only through\nthe expression Ub nb /Jb \u226a 1. Thus the trap-induced\nbroadening can be made arbitrarily small by reducing\nthe boson-boson interaction energy Ub , which sets the\nsmallest energy scale close to resonance. This is partly\nexplained by the fact that the resonances involve only\nphonons from the upper edge of the phonon band with\nwavelengths comparable to the lattice spacing a.\n\nIV.\n\nNUMERICAL SIMULATION\n\nThe theoretical results derived in the previous section\nare, strictly speaking, valid for stationary atomic currents in a homogeneous system. We now show based on\nnumerical simulations that the predicted negative differential conductance and the phonon resonances are observable in a system of finite size under the conditions of\na realistic measuring procedure. In order to measure the\natomic current in an experimental setup we envisage a\nprocedure consisting of the following three steps:\n(a) Initially, both the bosons and fermions are prepared\nin a horizontal optical lattice and the total system\n\nFIG. 4. (Color online) The displacement of the fermion as\na function of the lattice tilt \u03b4 determined numerically (symbols +, \u25e6, \u00d7) and corresponding analytical fits (solid lines).\nThe dominant NDC peak and the l = 1 phonon resonance\nat the boundary of the phonon band can be clearly recognized. The ratio V between the height of the l = 1 resonance\nand the NDC peak is V = {0.09, 0.14, 0.18} for increasing Jf .\nThe l = 2 resonance is visible for sufficiently large fermionic\nhopping Jf . The system parameters are Jf = {0.2, 0.4, 0.8},\nUb = 0.1, Ubf = 0.5 and the fitting parameters are \u03b5 = 0.1,\nJ \u0303f = 0.7Jf , lmax = 2, with energies in units of Jb .\n\nis in equilibrium [35]. The fermions are each localized in separate sites sparsely distributed through the\nfermionic lattice of sufficient depth so that Pi Pj \u2248 0\nholds. In this configuration the fermions are automatically cooled by the surrounding superfluid [36],\nwhich is only slightly distorted [13].\n(b) Subsequently, the lattice of the fermions is tilted for\na fixed evolution time \u03c4 of the order of h\u0304/Jf to let\nthem evolve. To obtain a detectable displacement of\nthe fermions the fermionic hopping Jf may have to\nbe increased by reducing the depth of the lattice.\n(c) Finally, the spatial distribution of the fermions is detected, e.g., by in situ single-atom resolved imaging [37, 38]. From the difference between the initial and final distributions it should be possible to\nextract a reliable estimate for the atomic current.\nAlternatively, the momentum distribution and hence\nthe drift velocity of the fermions may be determined\ndirectly by a time-of-flight measurement.\nTo demonstrate the feasibility of this procedure we\nhave simulated the fully coherent dynamics at zero temperature of both the bosons and fermions based on the\ncomplete Bose-Fermi Hubbard model given in Eq. (1).\nTo this end we have used the time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) algorithm [39], which is essentially an\nextension to the well-established density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method [40, 41]. The TEBD\nalgorithm permits the near-exact dynamical simulation of\nquantum many-body systems far from equilibrium, which\nis crucial for our purposes. The experimental procedure\nwas simulated for a system consisting of 101 lattice sites\n\n\f6\nwith a bosonic filling factor nb = 1 and a single fermion\ninitially located at the center of the lattice. We used box\nboundary conditions and the evolution time was limited\nto \u03c4 = 24h\u0304/Jb to minimize finite-size effects, primarily\nreflections of phonons from the boundaries.\nFigure 4 shows the displacement of the fermion as a\nfunction of the lattice tilt \u03b4 for a set of realistic experimental parameters, in particular, for three different values of the fermion hopping Jf . The main features predicted by our theoretical analysis can be clearly recognized, namely the dominant NCD-peak, the phonon resonance at \u03b4 \u2248 1 corresponding to the jump distance l = 1\nand the suppression of the current for \u03b4 \u226b 1. In addition,\nfor sufficiently large values of Jf the phonon resonance\nat \u03b4 \u2248 1/2 corresponding to the jump distance l = 2 is\nvisible. For lower values of Jf the phonon resonance for\nl = 2 may still lead to a characteristic drop in the current\nonce the lattice tilt exceeds half the phonon bandwidth.\nThe resonances for higher values of the jump distance l\nseem to be masked mainly by broadening effects for the\nparameter regimes tested.\nThe ratio between the height of the l = 1 phonon resonance and the NDC peak, i.e., their relative\nvisibility V , depends nontrivially on the fermion hopping Jf . The hopping Jf enters the expression for v\u0304d in\nEq. (10) through the matrix elements fq,l in the form\nof Jl (slJf /Jb ), where the parameter s depends on the\nlattice tilt. Close to resonance we have p\ns \u2248 1, whereas\nfor small tilts l\u2206 \u226a Ub nb we obtain s \u2248 2Jb /Ub nb and\nhence s \u226b 1 in the superfluid regime. Accordingly, the\nheight of the l = 1 phonon resonance (s \u2248 1) varies only\nslowly with Jf as opposed to the height of the NDC peak\n(s \u226b 1), which is characterized by the oscillatory nature\nof the Bessel functions. Thus a careful choice of Jf allows us to optimize the visibility V , i.e., to minimize the\nheight of the NDC peak, by tuning slJf /Jb close to a\nzero of the relevant Bessel functions. For the increasing\nvalues of Jf considered in our simulation the first zero of\nthe Bessel function J2 (z) is approached, which explains\nthe improved visibility V for higher Jf , shown in Fig. 4.\nThe general broadening of the phonon resonances may\nbe caused by finite-size effects and multiphonon processes. The finite-size effects include reflections of phonons from the boundary of the system that in turn affect the motion of the fermion. Multi-phonon processes,\nwhich have been neglected in our theoretical analysis,\nalso cause some broadening of the single-phonon resonances. In particular the continuous drop in the current\nto zero can be explained by the emission of several lowenergy phonons during a jump process, which is allowed\neven if the lattice tilt exceeds the phonon bandwidth.\nIn order to compare the numerical and the theoretical results, at least qualitatively, we adapt our expression for the drift velocity v\u0304d to a system of finite size.\nIn addition, we introduce the observed broadening effects characterized by the energy \u03b5 into the theory. Explicitly, we calculate the average drift velocity by usPlmax\n\u03b5\ning the expression v\u0304d\u03b5 =\nl>0 (al) Wl with the rates\nP\n\u221a\n\u03b5\n2\nWl = (2\u03c0/ \u03c0\u03b5h\u0304) q |fq,l | exp[\u2212(h\u0304\u03c9q \u2212 l\u2206)2 /\u03b52 ]. The\n\nFIG. 5. (Color online) The displacement of the fermion as\na function of the lattice tilt \u03b4 for different evolution times \u03c4\ndetermined numerically (connected data points). The NDC\npeak and the l = 1 phonon resonance are clearly visible also\nin presence of strong boson-fermion and boson-boson interactions. The additional peaks between the NDC peak and\nthe phonon resonance are due to finite-time effects. The displacement increases approximately linearly with the evolution\ntime \u03c4 . The system parameters are Jf = 0.5, Ub = Ubf = 1,\nwith energies in units of Jb .\n\nrates reduce to the previous expression Wl0 in absence\nof broadening, i.e., lim\u03b5\u21920 Wl\u03b5 = Wl0 . The average displacement of the fermion (in units of lattice sites) after the evolution time \u03c4 is then approximately given by\nx\u0304a \u2248 v\u0304d\u03b5 \u03c4 /a.\n\nWe fit this theoretical model to the numerical results\nwith the broadening \u03b5, the maximal jump distance lmax ,\nand the effective fermionic hopping J \u0303f as free parameters. The first two parameters allow us to extract a\nquantitative value for the broadening and to determine\nthe dominant hopping process in the experiment. The\nfermionic hopping needs adjustment because the bare\nhopping Jf is renormalized by coherent phonon processes, which lead to a reduced hopping J \u0303f < Jf as discussed in Refs. [12, 13]. This is in direct analogy to the\nincreased effective mass of polarons due to the drag of\nthe phonon cloud [42].\n\nAs can be seen in Fig. 4 the fit describes the numerical\nresults very accurately with moderate broadening \u03b5 and a\nminor reduction of the fermionic hopping Jf . Further, we\nfind that lmax = 2 and thus the dominant transport processes are nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor hopping;\nthis is consistent with the absence of higher-order phonon\nresonances noted earlier. The high level of agreement between our theoretical model and the numerical results is\npartly explained by two observations: First, the numerical results show that the fermion reaches a constant drift\nvelocity on a time scale much shorter than the evolution\ntime \u03c4 , thus transient effects due to the sudden tilting of\nthe lattice are negligible. Second, the drift velocity remains approximately constant over the entire evolution\ntime, as illustrated in Fig. 5, resulting in a stationary\natomic current.\n\n\f7\nSince our numerics simulates the full dynamics of\nthe system we can monitor the average position of the\nfermion at different evolution times \u03c4 and extend the\nrange of parameters considered so far. In particular, we\nare interested in the atomic current in presence of strong\nboson-fermion and boson-boson interactions, where our\ntheory, assuming a superfluid phase, is no longer applicable. Figure 5 shows the displacement of the fermion as a\nfunction of the lattice tilt \u03b4 for the interaction strengths\nUb = Ubf = Jb and for different evolution times \u03c4 . We see\nthat the NDC peak and the l = 1 phonon resonance are\nnot noticeably affected by the presence of strong interactions, thus they both seem to be robust features of the\natomic current. We note that the additional peaks in the\ndisplacement-tilt dependence (located between the NDC\npeak and the l = 1 phonon resonance) are due to finitetime effects, which is revealed by a more detailed analysis\nof the time dependence of the numerical results. Furthermore, we observe an approximately linear increase of the\ndisplacement of the fermion with the evolution time-a\nfinding also confirmed for weaker interactions.\nV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nStark states, respectively, with a generic fermion-phonon\ninteraction of an identical type to the one encoutered in\nsolids.\nWe have studied the dependence of the atomic current on the lattice tilt from first principles and found\nthat our model accommodates negative differential conductance and phonon resonances. To demonstrate that\nthese features are observable by using ultracold atoms in\nthe context of a finite-size system and a realistic measuring procedure we have calculated the atomic current\nnumerically by using the TEBD algorithm including the\nfull dynamics of both the bosons and the fermions. Our\nnumerical results show that the phonon resonance at the\nboundary of the phonon band is a robust phenomenon\nthat occurs over a wide range of system parameters despite broadening, which might be increased by finite temperature effects [13, 19] not directly taken into account in\nour model. Finally, we note that in an obvious extension\nof this work we will investigate the effect of the transition\nof the bosons from the superfluid to the Mott insulator\nregime on the atomic current through the system.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nIn our analytical and numerical investigation of\nphonon-assisted atomic currents along a tilted potential\nwe have shown that Bose-Fermi mixtures in optical lattices lend themselves naturally to investigate nonequilibrium transport phenomena present in solid-state systems.\nIn more detail, we have formulated an effective model\nfor the Bose-Fermi mixture describing the bosons and\nfermions in terms of Bogoliubov phonons and Wannier-\n\nM.B. thanks the Swiss National Science Foundation for\nthe support through the project PBSKP2/130366.
