The main result in this\npaper is a proof of the fact that the number N (F ; B) of Q-rational points\non X which have height at most B satisfies\nN (F ; B) = Od,\u03b5,n (B n\u22121+\u03b5 ),\nfor any \u03b5 > 0. The implied constant in this estimate depends at most\nupon d, \u03b5 and n. New estimates are also obtained for the number of\nrepresentations of a positive integer as the sum of three dth powers, and\nfor the paucity of integer solutions to equal sums of like polynomials.\nMathematics Subject Classification (2000): 11G35 (11P05,14G05)\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nFor any n > 3, let F \u2208 Z[X0 , . . . , Xn ] be a form of degree d > 2 that produces\na non-singular hypersurface F = 0 in Pn . The primary purpose of this paper\nis to study the distribution of rational points on this hypersurface. To this end\nwe define the quantity\nN (F ; B) = #{x \u2208 Zn+1 : F (x) = 0, h.c.f.(x0 , . . . , xn ) = 1, |x| 6 B},\nfor any B > 1, where |x| denotes the norm max06i6n |xi |. A simple heuristic\nargument leads one to expect an asymptotic formula of the shape\nN (F ; B) \u223c cF B n+1\u2212d ,\nas B \u2192 \u221e, for some non-negative constant cF . Birch [2] has shown that this is\nindeed the case when n is sufficiently large compared with d, and the conjecture\nof Manin [7] predicts that this estimate should be true as soon as n > 2d, with\nn > 4. When d = n = 3 the quantity N (F ; B) may be dominated by the\npresence of rational lines contained in the surface F = 0, in which case it is\n1\n\n\fmore interesting to study the distribution of rational points on the Zariski open\nsubset formed by deleting the lines from the surface. This paper is motivated\nby the following basic conjecture.\nConjecture 1. Let \u03b5 > 0 and suppose that F \u2208 Z[X0 , . . . , Xn ] is a non-singular\nform of degree d > 2. Then we have\nN (F ; B) = Od,\u03b5,n (B n\u22121+\u03b5 ).\nThroughout our work the implied constant in any estimate is absolute unless\nexplicitly indicated otherwise. In the case of Conjecture 1 for example, the\nconstant is permitted to depend only upon d, \u03b5 and n. Conjecture 1 is a special\ncase of a conjecture due to the second author [9, Conjecture 2], which predicts\nthat the same estimate should hold under the weaker assumption that F is\nabsolutely irreducible. Although Conjecture 1 is essentially best possible in\nthe case d = 2, it is almost certainly not so for d > 3 and n > 4. In fact\nConjecture 1 might be considered as an approximation to the conjecture of\nBatyrev and Manin [1], which leads one to expect an estimate of the shape\nN (F ; B) = oF (B n\u22121 ) for such values of d and n.\nIn this paper we return to the techniques introduced in our earlier study of\nrational points of bounded height on geometrically integral hypersurfaces [6].\nThus if F \u2208 Z[X0 , . . . , Xn ] is an absolutely irreducible form of degree d > 2, the\nmain result in this latter work [6, Corollary 2] implies that\n(\n\u221a\nd = 3,\nB n\u22127/4+5/(3 3)+\u03b5 ,\n\u221a\nN (F ; B) \u226ad,\u03b5,n\n(1.1)\nn\u22121+\u03b5\nn\u22125/3+3/(2 d)+\u03b5\nB\n+B\n, d > 4.\nIn particular this estimate establishes Conjecture 1 for d > 6, since any nonsingular form is automatically absolutely irreducible. The conjecture had already been established in the case d = 2, and for any d > 2 provided that\nn 6 4. This comprises the combined work of both the first and second authors\n[3, 5, 9]. In all other cases (1.1) is currently the best available estimate. It turns\nout however that the techniques used to prove (1.1) for absolutely irreducible\nforms can be made to yield a sharper estimate in the setting of non-singular\nforms. It is important to observe in this context that Conjecture 1 appears to\nbecome rapidly more difficult as d decreases. Our goal in the present paper has\nbeen merely to produce a bound which establishes Conjecture 1 for all d > 5,\nin as simple a manner as possible. It seems likely that the exponent may be\nimproved with further work, but that new ideas would be needed in order to\nprove the conjecture when d = 3 or 4. The following is our main result.\nTheorem 1. Let \u03b5 > 0 and suppose that F \u2208 Z[X0 , . . . , Xn ] is a non-singular\nform of degree d > 4. Then we have\nN (F ; B) \u226ad,\u03b5,n B n\u22121+\u03b5 + B n\u22122+2/\nIn particular Conjecture 1 holds for d > 5.\n2\n\n\u221a\n\u221a\nd+1/(d\u22121)\u22121/((d\u22122) d)+\u03b5\n\n.\n\n\fThe estimates in Theorem 1 and (1.1) coincide when d = 4. It is interesting\nto compare Theorem 1 with earlier work of the second author [8, Theorem 2].\nThere the bound N (F ; B) = O\u03b5,F (B n\u22121+\u03b5 ) is established for all non-singular\nforms F in at least 10 variables, provided that F has degree d > 3. As indicated\nthe formulation of [8, Theorem 2] involves an implied constant that is allowed\nto depend upon the coefficients of F . However a straightforward examination of\nthe proof of this result reveals that the bound is actually uniform in non-singular\nhypersurfaces of fixed degree d and fixed dimension n \u2212 1. It will be convenient\nto state this observation formally here.\nTheorem 2. Conjecture 1 holds for n > 9.\nWe are now in a position to combine all of our various results that pertain\nto Conjecture 1. We have already observed that this conjecture holds for all\nquadrics, and all forms in at most 5 variables. On combining Theorem 1 and\nTheorem 2 with these facts we therefore obtain the following result.\nCorollary 1. Conjecture 1 holds for all values of d and n except possibly for\nthe eight cases in which d = 3, 4 and n = 5, 6, 7, 8.\nIn a future paper we shall use methods from [5] to complete the proof of\nConjecture 1 for the eight remaining cases. The proof of Theorem 1 is based\nupon the proof of (1.1), and it will be useful to recall the basic idea here. For any\n\u03bd > 2, let f \u2208 Q[T1 , . . . , T\u03bd ] be a polynomial of total degree \u03b4, which produces\na non-singular hypersurface f = 0 in A\u03bd . Here we note that an affine variety is\nsaid to be non-singular if and only if it has a non-singular projective model, and\nwe shall henceforth think of a polynomial f as being non-singular if and only\nif the corresponding hypersurface f = 0 is non-singular. With this in mind we\ndefine the counting function\nM (f ; B) = #{t \u2208 Z\u03bd : f (t) = 0, |t| 6 B},\n\n(1.2)\n\nfor any B > 1. Then the main trick behind the proof of Theorem 1 is the simple\nobservation that\nX\nM (fb ; B),\n(1.3)\nN (F ; B) 6\n|b|6B\n\nwhere fb = fb (T1 , . . . , Tn ) denotes the polynomial F (b, T1 , . . . , Tn ). Typically\nfb will be non-singular and have degree d, so that the problem of proving good\nupper bounds for N (F ; B) is replaced by the problem of proving good upper\nbounds for M (f ; B) for non-singular polynomials f \u2208 Q[T1 , . . . , T\u03bd ] of degree\n\u03b4 > 3. The procedure is then to argue by induction on \u03bd, and it turns out that\nthe key ingredient is a sharp bound for the inductive base \u03bd = 3. Thus the main\nwork in the proof of Theorem 1 is actually taken up with a demonstration of\nthe following result.\nTheorem 3. Let \u03b5 > 0 and suppose that f \u2208 Z[T1 , T2 , T3 ] is a non-singular\npolynomial of degree \u03b4 > 4. Then we have\nM (f ; B) \u226a\u03b4,\u03b5 B 1+\u03b5 + B 2/\n\n\u221a\n\n3\n\n\u221a\n\u03b4+1/(\u03b4\u22121)\u22121/((\u03b4\u22122) \u03b4)+\u03b5\n\n.\n\n\fAs highlighted above, the implied constant here is only permitted to depend\nupon \u03b4 and \u03b5, and not on the individual coefficients of f . It is interesting to\ncompare Theorem 3 with the corresponding result [6, Theorem 2], that constitutes the inductive base at the heart of (1.1). This latter result applies to the\nclass of all degree \u03b4 polynomials in Z[T1 , T2 , T3 ], whose homogeneous part of degree \u03b4 is absolutely irreducible. However the estimate obtained is weaker than\nthat of Theorem 3, as soon as \u03b4 > 5. In fact the assumption of non-singularity\nin Theorem 3 affords us much better control over the curves of low degree contained in the surface f = 0, and this is crucial to the proof. Theorem 3 will be\nestablished in \u00a72, and this will then be used in \u00a73 to deduce Theorem 1.\nIt turns out that Theorem 3 has applications to a rather different set of\nproblems. We begin by seeing how it can be used to deduce better estimates\nfor the number of representations of a given integer as the sum of three powers.\nFor given integers d > 2 and N > 1, define rd (N ) to be the number of positive\nintegers t1 , t2 , t3 such that\ntd1 + td2 + td3 = N.\n\n(1.4)\n\nIt is plain that this equation defines a non-singular affine surface. Until recently\nthe best available estimate for rd (N ) was the trivial estimate\nrd (N ) = Od,\u03b5 (N 1/d+\u03b5 ),\n\n(1.5)\n\nwhose exponent is of course essentially best possible in the case d = 2. This was\nimproved for d > 8 by the second author [9, Theorem 13], who has replaced the\nexponent 1/d by \u03b8/d for d > 2, with\n\u221a\n\u03b8 = 2/ d + 2/(d \u2212 1).\n(1.6)\nBy combining the proof of this result with the key step in the proof of Theorem 3,\nwe shall establish the following result in \u00a74.\nCorollary 2. Let \u03b5 > 0 and suppose that d > 4. Then we have\nrd (N ) = Od,\u03b5 (N \u03b8/d+\u03b5 ),\nwith\n\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u03b8 = 2/ d + 1/(d \u2212 1) \u2212 1/((d \u2212 2) d).\n\nIt is clear that Corollary 2 improves upon the trivial estimate (1.5) for d > 5,\nand upon (1.6) in every case. In particular this provides further evidence for\nthe well-known conjecture that rd (N ) = Od,\u03b5 (N \u03b5 ), as soon as d > 4.\nTheorem 3 also has applications to paucity problems for equal sums of like\npolynomials. Let f \u2208 Z[T ] be a polynomial of degree d > 3, and let B be a\npositive integer. Then for any s > 2 we define Ls (f ; B) to be the number of\npositive integers x1 , . . . , x2s 6 B such that\nf (x1 ) + * * * + f (xs ) = f (xs+1 ) + * * * + f (x2s ).\n4\n\n(1.7)\n\n\fIt is conjectured that Ls (f ; B) is dominated by the s!B s trivial solutions, in\nwhich x1 , . . . , xs are a permutation of xs+1 , . . . , x2s . Outside of work due to\nLinnik [10], and later the first author [4], there has been relatively little attention\npaid to the quantity Ls (f ; B) for arbitrary polynomials f \u2208 Z[T ] of degree d.\nIn this setting, when s = 2, it follows from [4, Theorem 1] that\nL2 (f ; B) = 2B 2 (1 + of (1)),\nprovided that d > 7. Earlier work of Wooley [12] establishes such an estimate\nin the case d = 3. We are now ready to present the improvements that we have\nbeen able to make to this problem, the details of which may be found in \u00a74.\nCorollary 3. Let \u03b5 > 0 and suppose that f \u2208 Z[T ] is a polynomial of degree d.\nThen we have\nL2 (f ; B) = 2B 2 (1 + of (1))\nfor d > 5.\nAcknowledgement. While working on this paper, the first author was supported at Oxford University by EPSRC grant number GR/R93155/01.\n\n2\n\nAffine surfaces\n\nIn this section we shall prove Theorem 3. Consequently, let f \u2208 Z[T1 , T2 , T3 ]\nbe a non-singular polynomial of degree \u03b4 > 4. Throughout the proof it will be\nconvenient to work with the projective model for the affine surface f = 0. Thus\nlet X \u2282 P3 be the non-singular surface defined by the form\nF (X0 , X1 , X2 , X3 ) = X0\u03b4 f (X1 /X0 , X2 /X0 , X3 /X0 ),\n\n(2.1)\n\nof degree \u03b4. We may clearly assume that F is primitive, so that the highest\ncommon factor of its coefficients is 1. Throughout our work we shall always\nfollow the convention that any point x \u2208 P3 (Q) is represented by a vector\nx = (x0 , x1 , x2 , x3 ) \u2208 Z4 such that h.c.f.(x0 , x1 , x2 , x3 ) = 1, and we shall write\nx = [x] \u2208 P3 (Z) to express this fact. With this in mind we define the counting\nfunction\nN aff (\u03a3; B) = #{[1, x1 , x2 , x3 ] \u2208 \u03a3 \u2229 P3 (Z) : H([1, x1 , x2 , x3 ]) 6 B},\nfor any B > 1 and any locally closed subset \u03a3 \u2286 X defined over Q. In particular\nwe clearly have M (f ; B) = N aff (X; B) in the statement of Theorem 3.\nLet F \u2208 Z[X0 , X1 , X2 , X3 ] be a primitive form of degree d > 4 that defines\na non-singular surface X \u2282 P3 , and let k > 2 be an integer. Then it will be\nconvenient to introduce the open subset X (k) \u2286 X which is obtained by deleting\nall of the curves from X that are defined over Q and have degree at most k.\nIn particular X (k) is plainly empty for k > d and so we henceforth make the\nassumption that\n2 6 k 6 d \u2212 1.\n(2.2)\nWith this notation in mind our first goal is to establish the following estimate.\n5\n\n\fProposition 1. We have\nN aff (X (k) ; B) \u226ad,\u03b5 B 2/\n\n\u221a\n\n\u221a\nd+1/(k+1)\u22121/(k d)+\u03b5\n\n,\n\nfor any \u03b5 > 0.\nBefore proceeding with this task, we first indicate how this will suffice to\ncomplete the proof of Theorem 3. By a result of Colliot-Th\u00e9l\u00e8ne [9, Appendix],\nwe see that the non-singular surface X contains Od (1) geometrically integral\ncurves of degree at most d \u2212 2. We now need the following estimate due to Pila\n[11, Theorem A].\nLemma 1. Let \u03b5 > 0 and suppose that C \u2282 A\u03bd is a geometrically integral curve\nof degree \u03b4 > 1. Then we have\n#{t \u2208 C \u2229 Z\u03bd : |t| 6 B} = O\u03b4,\u03b5,\u03bd (B 1/\u03b4+\u03b5 ).\nHence it follows from Lemma 1 that the overall contribution to N aff (X; B)\nfrom the set of curves of degree at most d\u22122 is Od,\u03b5 (B 1+\u03b5 ), since we have already\nseen that there are only Od (1) such curves contained in X. On combining this\nwith an application of Proposition 1 with k = d \u2212 2 we therefore obtain the\nestimate\nN aff (X; B) \u226ad,\u03b5 B 1+\u03b5 + B 2/\n\n\u221a\n\n\u221a\nd+1/(d\u22121)\u22121/((d\u22122) d)+\u03b5\n\n.\n\nThis completes the deduction of Theorem 3 from Proposition 1.\nWe proceed by establishing Proposition 1. For any prime p we shall write Xp\nfor the surface defined over Fp that is obtained by reducing the coefficients of F\nmodulo p, and we denote the set Xp \u2229 P3 (Fp ) by Xp (Fp ). It will be convenient\nto define\nS(\u03a3; B) = {[1, x1 , x2 , x3 ] \u2208 \u03a3 \u2229 P3 (Z) : H([1, x1 , x2 , x3 ]) 6 B},\nfor any locally closed subset \u03a3 \u2286 X defined over Q, so that in particular\nN aff (\u03a3; B) = #S(\u03a3; B). Now let \u03c0 = [1, \u03c01 , \u03c02 , \u03c03 ] \u2208 Xp (Fp ), where \u03c01 , \u03c02 , \u03c03\nare always assumed to be in Fp . We also define the set\nn\no\nH([1, x1 , x2 , x3 ]) 6 B,\nSp (\u03a3; B, \u03c0) = [1, x1 , x2 , x3 ] \u2208 \u03a3 \u2229 P3 (Z) :\n,\nxi \u2261 \u03c0i (mod p), (1 6 i 6 3)\nfor any locally closed subset \u03a3 \u2286 X defined over Q. We shall base our proof\nof Proposition 1 on the proof of [6, Theorem 2]. Suppose first that log kF k \u226bd\nlog B, with a suitably large implied constant, where kF k denotes the maximum\nmodulus of the coefficients of F . Then an application of [6, Lemma 5] reveals\nthat N aff (X (k) ; B) 6 N aff (Y ; B), for some curve Y \u2282 P3 of degree Od (1) that\ndoes not contain any geometrically integral components of degree less than\nk. The contribution from each such component is clearly Od,\u03b5 (B 1/(k+1)+\u03b5 ) by\nLemma 1, and so it suffices to assume that\nlog kF k = Od (log B)\n6\n\n(2.3)\n\n\fin our proof of Proposition 1. The next step in the argument involves introducing\nthe set of x \u2208 X that have multiplicity at most 2 on the tangent plane section\nX \u2229 Tx (X). We shall henceforth denote this set by U , and write U (k) for the\nsubset of points that do not lie on any curve of degree at most k contained in\nX. In particular an application of [6, Lemmas 10 and 11] implies that U is a\nnon-empty open subset of X, and once combined with Lemma 1 we may deduce\nthat\nN aff (X (k) ; B) = N aff (U (k) ; B) + Od,\u03b5 (B 1/(k+1)+\u03b5 ).\nIn summary it will therefore suffice to establish Proposition 1 under the assumption that (2.3) holds, and with X (k) replaced by U (k) . For any prime p\nwe shall define Up to be the open set of non-singular points on Xp which have\nmultiplicity at most 2 on the tangent plane section at the point. Our main tool\nin the proof of Theorem 3 is the following result [6, Lemma 12].\nLemma 2. Let \u03b5 > 0 and let U, X be as above. Then there exists a set \u03a0 of\nOd,\u03b5 (1) primes p, with\n\u221a\nd+\u03b5\n\nB 1/\n\n\u226ad,\u03b5 p \u226ad,\u03b5 B 1/\n\n\u221a\n\nd+\u03b5\n\n,\n\n(2.4)\n\nsuch that the following holds. For each \u03c0 = [1, \u03c01 , \u03c02 , \u03c03 ] \u2208 Up (Fp ), there exists\na form G\u03c0 \u2208 Z[X0 , X1 , X2 , X3 ] of degree Od,\u03b5 (1) which is not divisible by F ,\nsuch that\n[\n[\n{[1, x1 , x2 , x3 ] \u2208 Sp (U ; B, \u03c0) : G\u03c0 (1, x1 , x2 , x3 ) = 0}.\nS(U ; B) =\np\u2208\u03a0 \u03c0\u2208Up (Fp )\n\nApplying Lemma 2 we therefore deduce that there exists a set \u03a0 of Od,\u03b5 (1)\nprimes p, with (2.4) holding, such that\nX\nN aff (U (k) ; B) 6\n#{[1, x1 , x2 , x3 ] \u2208 Sp (U ; B, \u03c0) : G\u03c0 (1, x1 , x2 , x3 ) = 0}.\np\u2208\u03a0\n\u03c0\u2208Up (Fp )\n\nHere the G\u03c0 \u2208 Z[X0 , X1 , X2 , X3 ] are a finite set of forms indexed by points\n\u03c0 = [1, \u03c01 , \u03c02 , \u03c03 ] \u2208 Up (Fp ). For each \u03c0 \u2208 Up (Fp ), the form G\u03c0 has degree\nOd,\u03b5 (1) and is not divisible by F . For any integral component Y = Y\u03c0 \u2282 P3 of\nthe curve F = G\u03c0 = 0 we write\nNpaff (Y ; B, \u03c0) = #Sp (Y ; B, \u03c0).\nNow let Y1 , . . . , Ys be the collection of those geometrically integral components\nof F = G\u03c0 = 0 which either have dimension 0, or have dimension 1 and degree\nat least k + 1. Then we will have s = Od,\u03b5 (1) and\nX\n#{[1, x1 , x2 , x3 ] \u2208 Sp (U (k) ; B, \u03c0) : G\u03c0 (1, x1 , x2 , x3 ) = 0} 6\nNpaff (Yj ; B, \u03c0).\n16j6s\n\n7\n\n\fAs we vary over primes p \u2208 \u03a0 and points \u03c0 \u2208 Up (Fp ), let I denote the\nset of components of the curves F = G\u03c0 = 0 that have dimension 0. Since\n#Up (Fp ) 6 #Xp (Fp ) = Od (p2 ) for each p \u2208 \u03a0, it easily follows from (2.4) that\n#I 6 s#\u03a0. max #Up (Fp ) = Od,\u03b5 (B 2/\n\n\u221a\n\nd+2\u03b5\n\np\n\n).\n\nThus the overall contribution to N aff (U (k) ; B) from the set I is satisfactory for\nProposition 1. We henceforth fix a choice of prime p \u2208 \u03a0 and a point \u03c0 \u2208 Up (Fp ).\nLet G\u03c0 be the corresponding form produced by Lemma 2 and let Y = Y\u03c0 \u2282 P3\nbe any geometrically integral component of the curve F = G\u03c0 = 0 of dimension\n1 and degree e > k+1. We now employ the following estimate [6, Proposition 2].\nLemma 3. Assume that Y has degree e > 3. Then we have\nNpaff (Y ; B, \u03c0) \u226ad,e,\u03b5 B 1/e\u22121/((e\u22121)\n\n\u221a\n\nd)\n\n.\n\n\u221a\n\nAs above, we note that #Up (Fp ) = Od,\u03b5 (B 2/ d+2\u03b5 ) for each p \u2208 \u03a0. On\nobserving that\n3 6 k + 1 6 e = Od,\u03b5 (1),\nby (2.2), we may therefore take e > k + 1 in Lemma 3 in order to conclude the\nproof that\n\u221a\n\u221a\nN aff (U (k) ; B) \u226ad,\u03b5 B 2/ d+1/(k+1)\u22121/(k d)+2\u03b5 .\nThis suffices for the proof of Proposition 1, and so also for that of Theorem 3.\n\n3\n\nAffine hypersurfaces\n\nIn this section we shall establish Theorem 1. Before doing so we take a moment\nto record a \"trivial\" upper bound for the quantity N (G; B), which has the\nadvantage of applying under the sole assumption that the form G is non-zero.\nThe following result is due to the second author [9, Theorem 1].\nLemma 4. Let G \u2208 Z[X0 , . . . , Xn ] be a non-zero form of degree d. Then we\nhave\nN (G; B) = Od,n (B n ).\nAs outlined in the introduction, the main ingredient in the proof of Theorem 1 will be Theorem 3. Let n > 3 and let F \u2208 Z[X0 , . . . , Xn ] be a non-singular\nform of degree d > 4. Then any affine model of F is also non-singular and has\ndegree d. For any b \u2208 Z we define the polynomial\nfb (X1 , . . . , Xn ) = F (b, X1 , . . . , Xn ).\nBy Lemma 4 we clearly have N (F (0, X1 , . . . , Xn ); B) = Od,n (B n\u22121 ). Hence, in\nview of (1.3), we deduce that\nX\nM (fb ; B),\n(3.1)\nN (F ; B) \u226ad,n B n\u22121 +\n0<|b|6B\n\n8\n\n\fwhere fb \u2208 Z[X1 , . . . , Xn ] is a non-singular polynomial of degree d for b 6= 0.\nThe primary aim of this section is to establish the following result, which may\nbe of independent interest.\nProposition 2. Let \u03b5 > 0 and let \u03bd > 3. Suppose that f \u2208 Z[T1 , . . . , T\u03bd ] is a\nnon-singular polynomial of degree \u03b4 > 4. Then we have\nM (f ; B) \u226a\u03b4,\u03b5,\u03bd B \u03bd\u22122+\u03b5 + B \u03bd\u22123+2/\n\n\u221a\n\n\u221a\n\u03b4+1/(\u03b4\u22121)\u22121/((\u03b4\u22122) \u03b4)+\u03b5\n\n.\n\nBefore proceeding with the proof of Proposition 2, we first see how it suffices\nto complete the proof of Theorem 1. But this is simply a matter of using (3.1)\nto deduce that\n\u221a\n\u221a\nX\n\u0001\nB n\u22122+\u03b5 + B n\u22123+2/ d+1/(d\u22121)\u22121/((d\u22122) d)+\u03b5\nN (F ; B) \u226ad,\u03b5,n B n\u22121 +\n0<|b|6B\n\n\u226ad,\u03b5,n B n\u22121+\u03b5 + B n\u22122+2/\n\n\u221a\n\n\u221a\nd+1/(d\u22121)\u22121/((d\u22122) d)+\u03b5\n\n,\n\nfor any \u03b5 > 0. This completes the deduction of Theorem 1 from Proposition\n2. The proof of Proposition 2 will involve taking repeated hyperplane sections\nof the non-singular affine hypersurface f = 0. We begin by establishing the\nfollowing auxiliary result, which will help us to control certain bad hyperplane\nsections that arise in our argument.\nLemma 5. Let f \u2208 Z[T1 , . . . , T\u03bd ] be a non-singular polynomial of degree \u03b4.\nThen there exists a matrix A = {aij }i,j6\u03bd \u2208 SL\u03bd (Z) with maxi,j |aij | \u226a\u03b4,\u03bd 1,\nsuch that if g(S1 , . . . , S\u03bd ) = f (A\u22121 S) then the following holds:\n1. g(S1 , . . . , S\u03bd ) is non-singular and has degree \u03b4.\n2. There exists k \u2208 Q such that g(k, S2 , . . . , S\u03bd ) is non-singular and has\ndegree \u03b4.\nProof. The first part of Lemma 5 is true for any polynomial obtained by nonsingular linear transformation from f . To establish the second part of the\nlemma, we consider the degree \u03b4 projective model F (X) = F (X0 , . . . , X\u03bd ) for f .\nThen since F is non-singular, there exists a non-zero form F\u0302 (Y) = F\u0302 (Y0 , . . . , Y\u03bd )\nof degree O\u03b4,\u03bd (1), such that F\u0302 (y) = 0 whenever the pair of equations\nF (X) = X.y = 0\nproduce a singular form. In fact the theory of the dual variety ensures that F\u0302\nis irreducible and has degree at least 2, although we shall not need these facts\nhere. It follows from Lemma 4 that we may find a vector b \u2208 Z\u03bd+1 such that\n|b| \u226a\u03b4,\u03bd 1 and b1 F\u0302 (b) 6= 0. Set h = h.c.f.(b1 , . . . , b\u03bd ) and write\nk = \u2212h\u22121 b0 ,\n\na1j = h\u22121 bj ,\n\nfor 1 6 j 6 \u03bd. Then it follows that h.c.f.(a11 , . . . , a1\u03bd ) = 1, and we may\ntherefore find a matrix A = {aij }i,j6\u03bd \u2208 GL\u03bd (Z) such that det(A) = 1 and\n9\n\n\fmaxi,j |aij | \u226a\u03b4,\u03bd 1. We then see that the variety g(k, S2 , . . . , S\u03bd ) = 0 is alternatively given by f (A\u22121 (k, S2 , . . . , S\u03bd )) = 0, and so is equal to the variety\nf (T1 , . . . , T\u03bd ) = 0,\n\na11 T1 + * * * + a1\u03bd T\u03bd = k,\n\nwhich is non-singular and has degree \u03b4 by construction. This completes the\nproof of Lemma 5.\nWe now proceed with the proof of Proposition 2, for which we employ induction on \u03bd. The inductive base \u03bd = 3 is satisfactory by Theorem 3. By Lemma 5\nthere exists a non-singular polynomial g = g(S1 , . . . , S\u03bd ) and a constant c \u226a\u03b4,\u03bd 1\nsuch that\nX\nM (g\u03ba ; cB),\nM (f ; B) 6 M (g; cB) =\n|\u03ba|6cB\n\nwhere we write g\u03ba (S2 , . . . , S\u03bd ) = g(\u03ba, S2 , . . . , S\u03bd ) for any fixed choice of \u03ba. Then\nif g\u03ba is non-singular and has degree \u03b4, we may employ the induction hypothesis\nto deduce that\nM (g\u03ba ; cB) \u226a\u03b4,\u03b5,\u03bd B \u03bd\u22123+\u03b5 + B \u03bd\u22124+2/\n\n\u221a\n\n\u221a\n\u03b4+1/(\u03b4\u22121)\u22121/((\u03b4\u22122) \u03b4)+\u03b5\n\n.\n\nAlternatively, if g\u03ba is singular or has degree is less than \u03b4, we use the trivial\nestimate M (g\u03ba ; cB) = O\u03b4,\u03bd (B \u03bd\u22122 ) coming from [5, Equation (2.3)]. Note that\ng\u03ba cannot vanish identically since g is an irreducible polynomial of degree at\nleast two. We claim that that there are just O\u03b4,\u03bd (1) values of \u03ba \u2208 Z for which\ng\u03ba is a bad hyperplane section, where we think of a hyperplane section as being\nbad if it produces a polynomial which is either singular or of strictly smaller\ndegree. To see the claim we note as in the proof of Lemma 5 that there is a\npolynomial \u011d(\u03ba) of degree O\u03b4,\u03bd (1), which vanishes precisely when g\u03ba is a bad\nhyperplane section. But Lemma 5 also ensures that \u011d does not vanish identically,\nwhich therefore establishes the claim. Hence\n\u221a\n\u221a\nX\n\u0001\nB \u03bd\u22123+\u03b5 + B \u03bd\u22124+2/ \u03b4+1/(\u03b4\u22121)\u22121/((\u03b4\u22122) \u03b4)+\u03b5\nM (f ; B) \u226a\u03b4,\u03b5,\u03bd B \u03bd\u22122 +\n|\u03ba|6cB\n\n\u226a\u03b4,\u03b5,\u03bd B \u03bd\u22122+\u03b5 + B \u03bd\u22123+2/\n\n\u221a\n\n\u221a\n\u03b4+1/(\u03b4\u22121)\u22121/((\u03b4\u22122) \u03b4)+\u03b5\n\n.\n\nThis establishes Proposition 2, and so completes the proof of Theorem 1.\n\n4\n\nProof of Corollaries 2 and 3\n\nWe begin by considering the affine surface (1.4), with a view to establishing\nCorollary 2. Thus it plainly suffices to show that for any B > N 1/d we have\n\u221a\n\nM (h; B) \u226ad,\u03b5 B 2/\n\n\u221a\nd+1/(d\u22121)\u22121/((d\u22122) d)+\u03b5\n\n,\n\nin the notation of (1.2), where h denotes the non-singular polynomial\nh(T1 , T2 , T3 ) = T1d + T2d + T3d \u2212 N.\n10\n\n(4.1)\n\n\fLet S \u2282 A3 denote the surface h = 0. Then a straightforward inspection of the\nproof of [9, Theorem 13] shows that the overall contribution to M (h; B) from\nthe union of curves of degree at most d\u2212 2 contained in S, is Od,\u03b5 (B 1/d+\u03b5 ). This\nis plainly satisfactory for (4.1). In order to complete the proof of Corollary 2 it\ntherefore suffices to apply Proposition 1 with k = d \u2212 2, much as in the proof\nof Theorem 3.\nFinally we establish Corollary 3. For this we shall take k = d \u2212 2 in the\nstatement of Proposition 1. \u221a\nBut then it follows that Hypothesis\n[d, \u03b8d ] holds in\n\u221a\n[4, Theorem 3], with \u03b8d = 2/ d + 1/(d \u2212 1) \u2212 1/((d \u2212 2) d). Let B be a positive\n(0)\ninteger and let Ls (f ; B) denote the contribution to Ls (f ; B) from the integer\nsolutions to (1.7) in which x1 , . . . , xs are not a permutation of xs+1 , . . . , x2s .\nThen we deduce that\nLs (f ; B) = s!B s + L(0)\ns (f ; B),\nwith\n\u0010\n\u221a \u0011\n\u221a\n1/3\n2/ d+1/(d\u22121)\u22121/((d\u22122) d)\n2s\u22123+\u03b5\n.\nB\n+\nB\nL(0)\n(f\n;\nB)\n\u226a\nB\n\u03b5,f\ns\n\nThis therefore establishes Corollary 3.\n\nReferences\n[1] V.
