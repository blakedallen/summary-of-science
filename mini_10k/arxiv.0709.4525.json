In this talk, we shortly report results from our recent global DGLAP analysis of\nnuclear parton distributions. This is an extension of our former EKS98-analysis improved with\nan automated \u03c72 minimization procedure and uncertainty estimates. Although our new analysis\nshow no significant deviation from EKS98, a sign of a significantly stronger gluon shadowing\ncould be seen in the RHIC BRAHMS data.\n\n1. Introduction\nThe global analysis of nuclear parton distributions (nPDFs) is driven by the experimental fact\nthat the deep inelastic structure functions F2 (x, Q2 ) measured from nuclear targets show a\nsignificant deviation from the free proton ones [1, 2].\nPerhaps the most simple theoretical approach to this observation is to make use of the\nfactorization theorem of QCD that has proven to provide excellent description of inclusive crosssections in free-nucleon collisions. In this approach, the cross-sections are of the generic form\n\u03c3AB\u2192h+X =\n\nX\nij\n\nfiA (x1 , Q2 ) \u2297 fjB (x2 , Q2 ) \u2297 \u03c3 i+j\u2192h+X ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere where \u03c3 i+j\u2192h+X is the perturbative QCD (pQCD) matrix element squared and fi s are\nthe non-perturbative parton densities whose scale evolution obeys the DGLAP equations [3].\nThe purpose of the global analysis of nPDFs is to find out whether the observed differences\nin the structure functions, the nuclear modifications, can consistently be absorbed in to the\ninput parton densities - in other words, do the nuclear modifications effectively factorize. If\nthey do, the resulting nPDFs are of great practical interest, since they can be used as a input\nin any process that can be factorized as in eq. (1). In this framework the deep question about\nthe dynamical origin of nuclear modifications is not addressed, on the contrary, one must be as\nunbiased to any model as possible.\nIndeed, three independent groups have shown that this approach works quite well:\n\u2022 EKS98 [4, 5] was the first global analysis demonstrating that using the leading-order (LO)\npQCD formalism, requiring momentum and baryon number conservation, one can reproduce\nthe data from measurements of deep inelastic lepton-nucleus scattering (DIS) and Drell-Yan\ndilepton production (DY) in proton-nucleus collisions. The fit was done only by eye.\n1\n\nThe speaker\n\n\f\u2022 HKM [6] & HKN [7] which are LO QCD analyses as well, were the first ones to exploit the\nautomated \u03c72 -minimization procedure and to estimate nPDF uncertainties.\n\u2022 nDS [8] brought the global analysis of nPDFs to the next-to-leading order level in pQCD.\nBased on our earlier work, EKS98, we have performed a global reanalysis of nPDFs published\nin [9] and reported here. What was new compared to the EKS98 were the automated \u03c72 minimization procedure and a first attemp for estimating the uncertainties. Although our main\nobjective was to see whether we can improve the EKS98-fit and study the uncertainties, this\nwas anyway a necessary stepping stone for us before we can extend our analysis to NLO-level.\nMotivated by the BRAHMS data [10] on inclusive hadron production in D+Au collision,\nwhich show a systematic suppression relative to p+p at forward rapidities, we raise an intriguing\nquestion about the possibility of having clearly stronger gluon shadowing than what has been\nhitherto seen in the global DGLAP analyses.\n2. The framework\nWe define the PDFs fiA (x, Q2 ) of bound protons in a nucleus with mass number A as\nfiA (x, Q2 ) = RiA (x, Q2 )fiCTEQ6L1 (x, Q2 ),\n\n(2)\n\nwhere fiCTEQ6L1 refers to the latest free proton PDFs by the CTEQ collaboration [11]. For\nthe bound neutrons we assume the isospin symmetry dproton = uneutron and vice versa.\nWhat we actually parametrize, are the nuclear modifications RiA (x, Q2 ) at the initial scale\nQ20 = 1.69 GeV 2 . At present, the lack of precision data forces us to consider only three different\nA (x, Q2 ) for\nmodifications: RVA (x, Q20 ) for all valence quarks, RSA (x, Q20 ) for all sea quarks, and RG\n0\ngluons.\nThe fit functions are parametrized in three pieces (c.f. Fig. 3):\nA\nA\nA\nA\nA\nR1A (x) = cA\n0 + (c1 + c2 x)[exp(\u2212x/xs ) \u2212 exp(\u2212xa /xs )],\nA\nA 2\nA 3\nR2A (x) = aA\n0 + a1 x + a2 x + a3 x ,\nbA \u2212 bA\n1x\n,\nR3A (x) = 0\n(1 \u2212 x)\u03b2 A\n\nx \u2264 xA\na\nA\nxA\n\u2264\nx\n\u2264\nx\na\ne\n\n(3)\n\nxA\ne \u2264 x,\n\nThe first one covers the region from shadowing to anti-shadowing maximum at xA\na , the second\ncomes down to EMC-minimum at xA\n,\nand\nthe\nthird\nis\nfor\nthe\nFermi-motion\npart.\ne\nThe A-dependence of the fit parameters is assumed to follow a power law\nziA = ziAref (\n\nA pz\n) i,\nAref\n\n(4)\n\nwhere we have chosen Carbon (Aref = 12) as a reference nucleus.\nA\nAfter fixing the continuity of RiA s and their first derivatives at xA\na and xe , one is still left with\n42 free parameters of which the baryon number and momentum conservation eat only 4 away.\nThis was still too much in order to obtain converging fits, and lots of manual work was needed\ntoo see which parameters were the most relevant ones. At the end there was 16 fit parameters.\n3. Results & Error analysis\nThe experimental input in our analysis was about 500 points of DIS- and DY-data in a form\nDIS :\n\n1\nlA\n2\nA d\u03c3 /dQ dx LO A\n= RF2 (x, Q2 ),\n1\nlD /dQ2 dx\nd\u03c3\n2\n\nDY :\n\npA\n1\n2\nA d\u03c3DY /dx2 dQ LO A\n= RDY (x2 , Q2 ).\npD\n1\n2\nd\u03c3\n/dx\ndQ\n2\nDY\n2\n\n(5)\n\n\fThese covered 11 different nuclei from Helium up to Lead.

This resulted as an unreliably small error\nbands for gluons and sea quarks, and they had to be computed separately. They are the \"Largex errors\" in Fig. 3. The combined uncertainties are shown as a yellow bands. Interestingly, the\nold EKS98 parametrization lies within these uncertainties and there is no reason to release a\nnew parametrization - EKS98 works just fine.\nHowever, one should be very cautious about these error bands! First, below x \u223c 10\u22122\nthere is no experimental data above Q2 = 1.69 GeV 2 , and the behaviour at small-x region is\nconstrained only by the sum rules and is bound to the form of the fit function. Second, the PDFs\nthemselves depend on choices and conventions, like kinematical cuts, choosing the factorization\nscale, treatment of heavy quarks, and choosing and weighting data sets in forming \u03c72 . How these\nchoices affect the obtained PDFs is not seen in the error analysis performed here - the error\nbands only reflect the experimental data and their errors. Third, there is no well-established\nway to choose \u2206\u03c72 , and our choice \u2206\u03c72 \u2248 18 is probably quite restrictive.\n\n\f1.4\n1.2\n1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n\nFit errors\nLarge errors\nTotal errors\n\nthis work\nEKS98\n\n1.2\n1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0 -4\n10\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n1\n\n1.2\n1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n\nRAF2\n\nRAV\nRAG\n\n1.4\n1.2\n1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n\nRAS\n\nQ20 = 1.69 GeV2\n\nA = 208,\n\nFigure 3. Initial nuclear ratios for Lead together with their uncertainty estimates\n4. Are the gluons different?\nThe DY and DIS data leave the gluons very unconstrained - gluon dependence comes only\nthrough the DGLAP-evolution. One possible way to constrain the gluon sector could be the\ninclusive hadron production at RHIC. Figure 4 shows data from the BRAHMS collaboration\n[10] for RDAu , the ratio between charged hadron production in D+Au and p+p collisions as a\nfunction of hadron's pT .

The ratio RDAu is shown as a function\nof hadrons transverse momentum at four different pseudorapidities. The BRAHMS data [10]\nare shown with the statistical error bars and the shaded systematic error limits. A pQCD\ncalculation for h+ + h\u2212 production with the nuclear modifications from present work and KKP\nfragmentation functions is shown by the black lines, and that with the strong gluon shadowing,\nshown at right, by green lines.\n\u03c3 AB\u2192h+X =\n\nX\nijkl\n\nfiA (x1 , Q) \u2297 fjB (x2 , Q) \u2297 \u03c3 i+j\u2192k+l \u2297 Dk\u2192h+X (z, Qf ),\n\n(8)\n\n\fwhere the D(z, Q2 )s are the fragmentation functions. In Fig. 4 the pQCD calculation which\nemploys the nPDFs from the present analysis and KKP [19] fragmentation functions, is shown\nby dark line. It is evident that, especially at very forward direction, our prediction is above the\ndata and the shape is not well reproduced.\nSince hadron production at the kinematical corner of low-pT and forward rapidity reaches\nthe small-x region of PDFs where the gluon distributions are the dominant ones, this could be\nsignaling a larger uncertainty in our gluon modifications than seen in Fig. 3. For this reason\nwe present an example of gluon shadowing that is much stronger. This is shown on the right\nhand side of Fig. 4, and it really helps: using this gluon modification the corresponding curve\nfor RDAu is brought clearly closer to the BRAHMS data.\nHowever, it's still too early to draw very strong conclusions from this observation, but a\nsystematic study in the context of global DGLAP analysis is needed [20]. One should also bear\nin mind that here we are considering effects at very low-pT region, where the simple LO pQCD\npicture is pushed to its very limits - although one can argue that in ratios like RdAu some higher\norder effects would partially cancel. Anyway, one should be very careful when interpreting these\nresults. For example, it has been conjectured, that this particular BRAHMS data set could be\na sign of parton saturation at work [21].\nAcknowledgements\nCAS is supported by the 6th Framework Programme of the European Community under the\nMarie Curie contract MEIF-CT-2005-024624.
