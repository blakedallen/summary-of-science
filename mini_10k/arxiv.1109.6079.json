Introduction\nThe simulation of particle interactions in matter involves a number of atomic physics parameters,\nwhose values affect physics models applied to particle transport and experimental observables calculated by the simulation. Despite the fundamental character of these parameters, a consensus has\nnot always been achieved about their values, and different Monte Carlo codes use different sets of\nparameters.\nAtomic parameters are especially relevant to simulation scenarios that are sensitive to detailed\nmodeling of the properties of the interacting medium. Examples include the generation of characteristic lines resulting from X-ray fluorescence or Auger electron emission, and precision simulation studies, such as microdosimetry, that involve the description of particle interactions with\nmatter down to energies comparable with the scale of atomic binding energies.\n\n\u20131\u2013\n\n\fSimulation in these domains has been for an extended time the object of specialized Monte\nCarlo codes; some general purpose Monte Carlo systems have devoted attention to these areas, introducing functionality for the simulation of fluorescence, PIXE (Particle Induced X-ray Emission)\nand microdosimetry. In this context, emphasis has been placed on the development and validation\nof the physics models implemented in the simulation systems, while relatively limited effort has\nbeen invested into verifying the adequacy of the atomic parameters used by general purpose Monte\nCarlo codes with regard to the requirements of new application domains.\nThis paper surveys atomic binding energies used by well known Monte Carlo systems, including EGS [1], EGSnrc [2], Geant4 [3, 4], ITS (Integrated Tiger Series) [5], MCNP/MCNPX [6, 7]\nand Penelope [8], and by some specialized physics codes. These software systems use a variety of\ncompilations of binding energies, which are derived from experimental data or theoretical calculations; this paper investigates their accuracy and their effects on simulations.\nTo date, to the best of our knowledge, no comprehensive review of the binding energies used\nby major Monte Carlo codes has been documented in the literature yet. The most recent review of\natomic binding energies is included in the Handbook of X-Ray Data [9]: it is limited to comparing\ntwo compilations of binding energies [10, 11], derived from experimental data, with respect to a\ncommon reference [12]; the comparison rests on the visual appraisal of plots. Out of the three\ncompilations of binding energies examined, only two are used by major Monte Carlo systems. We\nare not aware either of previously published objective estimates, based on statistical methods, of\nthe compatibility with experiment of the binding energies used in Monte Carlo simulation, and of\nsimulation observables that depend on them.\nA small subset of preliminary results of this study were summarized in a conference paper [13].\n\n2. Compilations of electron binding energies\nThe binding energies considered in this study concern neutral atoms in their ground state; several\ncompilations of their values, of experimental and theoretical origin, are available in the literature.\nCompilations based on experimental data are the result of the application of selection, evaluation, manipulations (like interpolation and extrapolation) and semi-empirical criteria to available\nexperimental measurements to produce a set of reference values covering the whole periodic system\nof the elements and the complete atomic structure of each element.\nMost of the collections of electron binding energies based on experimental data derive from\na review published by Bearden and Burr in 1967 [10]. Later compilations introduced further refinements in the evaluation of experimental data and the calculation of binding energies for which\nno measurements were available; they also accounted for new data taken after the publication of\nBearden and Burr's review.\nExperimental atomic binding energies can be affected by various sources of systematic effects;\nthey originate not only from the use of different experimental techniques in the measurements, but\nalso from physical effects: for instance, binding energies of elements in the solid state are different\nfrom those of free atoms, and binding energy measurements can be affected by the chemical state\nof a solid.\nThe first attempt to calculate electron binding energies was reported by Slater [14]; since\nthen, various relativistic computations of neutral atom binding energies have been performed [15].\n\n\u20132\u2013\n\n\fThey exploit methods based on a Dirac-Hartree-Slater model, with corrections for QED (quantum\nelectrodynamics) effects and the nuclear charge distribution.\n2.1 Selected compilations\nThis paper evaluates a selection of binding energy compilations, which are used by general purpose\nsimulation systems and some representative specialized codes:\n\u2022 the compilation by Bearden and Burr [10],\n\u2022 the compilation by Carlson [16],\n\u2022 the tabulation included in Evaluated Atomic Data Library (EADL) [17],\n\u2022 the compilation assembled by Sevier in 1979 [12],\n\u2022 the compilations included in the seventh and eighth editions of the Table of Isotopes [18,19],\nrespectively published in 1978 and 1996,\n\u2022 the compilation by Williams included in the X-ray Data Booklet [20] and in the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics [21].\nBearden and Burr performed a comprehensive evaluation of experimental X-ray wavelength\ndata; the techniques they used to establish a consistent energy scale and to deal with elements with\nmultiple or missing measurements are documented in [10]. This compilation has been the basis\nfor several other ones published in the following years and is still used in some physics software\nsystems.\nCarlson's compilation reproduces the one by Lotz [22] with a few modifications and extensions, that concern the data for krypton and xenon, the binding energies of elements with atomic\nnumber greater than 94 and the P shell data of elements with atomic number between 87 and 95.\nThe compilation covers atomic numbers from 1 to 106; values are given for free atoms and are\nreferenced to the vacuum potential.\nThe compilation by Lotz is based on Bearden and Burr's evaluated data, complemented by\nother experimental measurements. The tabulated binding energies were determined according to\nempirical criteria, interpolation and extrapolation of available data. Since values are listed for free\natoms, the work function was taken into account in converting experimental binding energies for\nsolids. According to [22], the uncertainties of the tabulated values are at most 2 eV for elements\nwith atomic number up to 92; larger uncertainties, in some cases greater than 10 eV, are reported\nfor heavier elements.\nThe binding energies collected in the seventh edition of the Table of Isotopes (identified in the\nfollowing as ToI 1978) were taken from Shirley et al. [23] for elements with atomic number up to\n30, and from a compilation of experimental data by the Uppsala Group [24] for heavier elements.\nThe tabulated binding energies derive mainly from photoelectron spectroscopic measurements;\ndata were taken from Bearden and Burr's compilation in cases where experimental photoelectron\nmeasurements were not available. Interpolation and extrapolation techniques were used to complement experimental data. The data are listed with reference to the Fermi level and concern elements\nwith atomic number from 1 to 104. Uncertainties are reported as about 0.1 eV for light elements\n\n\u20133\u2013\n\n\fand 1-2 eV for most elements with atomic number greater than 30; uncertainties approaching 100\neV are mentioned for transuranic elements. Shifts of the order of 10 eV in the binding energy of\nnon-valence shells can result from changes in the chemical state of the medium [23].\nThe binding energies collected in the eighth edition of the Table of Isotopes (identified in the\nfollowing as ToI 1996) were taken from the compilation by Larkins [25]. Binding energies are\nreported for solid systems referenced to the Fermi level, except those for noble gases, Cl and Br,\nwhich are for vapor phase systems referenced to the vacuum level. Uncertainties may be as large\nas 10-20 eV for the inner orbitals in the high-Z elements, and changes in chemical state can lead to\nsubstantial shifts in the binding energies of non-valence shells [23].\nThe binding energies tabulated by Larkins are based on Sevier's 1972 compilation [26] for\nelements with atomic number up to 83 and on the compilation by Porter and Freedman [27] for\nheavier elements; with respect to these references, Larkins includes some updated values for Ar,\nGe, As, Se, Xe and Hg. Sevier's 1972 tabulations were mainly an update to Bearden and Burr's\nones to include more recent measurements; a further extension was published by Sevier in 1979\n[12]. Porter and Freedman combined a theoretical approach and experimental measurements to\ninterpolate data for heavy elements.\nThe eighth edition of the Table of Isotopes also includes a list of ionization energies of the\nelements (concerning the least bound electron), which reflects the data available from NIST (United\nStates National Institute of Standards and Technology) [28]; these values differ in some cases from\nthose in the tabulation of electron binding energies in the same volume.\nWilliams' compilation is based on Bearden and Burr's data; some values are taken from [33]\nwith additional corrections, and some from [34]. The energies are given relative to the vacuum\nlevel for the rare gases and for H, N, O, F and Cl, relative to the Fermi level for metals and relative\nto the top of the valence bands for semiconductors. The tabulations concern elements with atomic\nnumber between 1 and 92.\nThe atomic subshell parameters collected in EADL are derived from theoretical calculations\nby Scofield [29, 30]; besides these two references, EADL documentation cites a \"private communication\" by Scofield, dated 1988, as a source of the data. Due to the scarcity of documentation\nabout the origin of the binding energies listed in EADL, it is difficult to ascertain how they were\ncalculated, and what assumptions and approximations may be underlying. Binding energy values,\nalthough not for all elements and shells of the periodic system, are reported in some publications\nby Scofield [31, 32]; those in [32] appear consistent with EADL tabulations. EADL data concern\nisolated, neutral atoms with atomic number up to 100.\n2.2 Binding energies used by physics software systems\nGeneral purpose Monte Carlo systems and specialized codes use a variety of binding energy compilations.\nEGS5 uses the binding energies tabulated in the 1996 edition of the Table of Isotopes, while\nEGSnrc uses the values of the earlier 1978 edition, as EGS4 [35] did.\nMCNP, MCNPX and ITS use the electron binding energies compiled by Carlson.\nThe Penelope 2008 version uses Carlson's compilation of binding energies; earlier versions\nused the compilation included in the 1978 edition of the Table of Isotopes.\n\n\u20134\u2013\n\n\fThe Geant4 toolkit uses various collections of binding energies. The main reference for binding energies in Geant4 is the G4AtomicShells class in the materials package; according to comments in the code implementation, the binding energies values in it derive from Carlson's compilation and the 73rd edition of the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics [36].\nEADL values are used by the implementations of photon and electron interactions in Geant4\nlow energy electromagnetic package [37, 38] based on the so-called Livermore Library, which\nencompasses the Evaluated Electron Data Library (EEDL) [39], the Evaluated Photon Data Library\n(EPDL97) [40] and EADL itself. EADL binding energies are also used in the calculation of proton\nionization cross sections described in [41] and released in Geant4 9.4 in a modified version [42]\nto address the drawbacks documented in [43]. Proton ionization cross sections for Geant4 PIXE\n(Particle Induced X-ray Emission) simulation described in [43] derive from ISICS [44] tabulations\nusing Bearden and Burr's binding energies.\nGeant4 includes a C++ reimplementation of physics models originally implemented in Penelope; Geant4 9.4 reimplements models from the 2008 version of Penelope, while previous Geant4\nreleases included models equivalent to Penelope 2001. The Geant4 9.4 reimplementation appears\nto use EADL values instead of the binding energies used by Penelope 2008. Binding energies corresponding to the values in the 1978 edition of the Table of Isotopes are included in a Geant4 9.4\ndata set associated with Penelope.\nIonization energies consistent with those reported by NIST [28] are included in the Geant4\nG4StaticSandiaData class.\nNo reference to atomic binding energies can be retrieved in GEANT 3 documentation; however, according to comments embedded in the code, GEANT 3 used Bearden and Burr's binding\nenergies, with updated values for xenon derived from [46]. Nevertheless, the GSHLIN subroutine,\nwhere binding energies are hard-coded, exhibits some discrepancies with respect to both Bearden\nand Burr's tabulations and the values in [46]; the origin of these values could not be retrieved in\nthe literature, nor in the software documentation. Presumably, the code implementation and its\ncomments went out of phase at some stage of GEANT 3 evolution.\nAtomic binding energies are relevant to PIXE calculations; two well known software systems\npertinent to this domain are GUPIX [47] and ISICS [44]. GUPIX uses Sevier's 1979 compilation of\nbinding energies [48], which includes extensions to the 1972 collection by the same author. ISICS\nuses Bearden and Burr's binding energies by default; the most recent version of the code [49] offers\nthe option of using the binding energies assembled in Williams's compilation instead of Bearden\nand Burr's ones.\nThe authors of this paper could not retrieve track of the electron binding energies used by\nFLUKA in the related software documentation and in the literature, nor from direct inquiries with\nthe maintainers of the code; it was not possible to ascertain them from the software implementation,\nwhose disclosure is subject to restrictions, as their presumed source file is in a binary encoded\nformat.\n2.3 Comparison of binding energies compilations\nThe binding energies collected in the various compilations exhibit some differences, apart from\nthose due to different references - the vacuum potential or the Fermi level.\n\n\u20135\u2013\n\n\fA few examples of comparison are displayed in figures 1-3; the plots show the difference\nbetween the binding energies in the various compilations and the values in Williams' compilation.\nThe choice of Williams' compilation as a reference for plotting differences is arbitrary; the main\nqualitative features of the plots are anyway equivalent, if other empirical compilations are chosen\nas a reference instead of Williams' one. The difference between EADL and Williams' K shell\nbinding energies is plotted separately from the other compilations, since the scale is approximately\na factor 30 larger.\nThe differences are of the order of a few electronvolts across the various empirical compilations, as illustrated in figure 1(a), while they are larger between EADL and the empirical compilations, especially for inner shells, as shown in figure 1(b); they can reach a few hundred electronvolts for the K shell of heavier elements. The empirical compilations derive from a common source\n(Bearden and Burr's review); therefore it is not surprising that they exhibit some similarities.\n600\n10\n500\n7.5\n400\n\nDifference (eV)\n\nDifference (eV)\n\n5\n2.5\n0\n-2.5\n-5\n\n300\n\n200\n\n100\n\n-7.5\n0\n-10\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\nAtomic number\n\n-100\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\nAtomic number\n\n(a) Carlson, ToI 1978-1996, Sevier 1979, Bearden and Burr\n\n(b) EADL\n\nFigure 1.

Strategy of the study\nThe study documented in this paper is driven by pragmatic motivations. The analysis is focused on\nquantifying the accuracy of binding energy compilations used in Monte Carlo systems, and their\nimpact on physics models of particle transport and on experimental observables produced by the\nsimulation. The evaluation aims at identifying one or more optimal options for Monte Carlo applications in experimental practice. A comprehensive review of the physical ground, experimental\nmeasurements and methods of calculations of electron binding energies is outside the scope of this\npaper.\nTwo complementary approaches are adopted: direct validation of tabulated electron binding\nenergy values and the evaluation of effects on related physics quantities, like ionization cross sec-\n\n\u20136\u2013\n\n\f100\n10\n80\n\nDifference (eV)\n\nDifference (eV)\n\n0\n\n-10\n\n-20\n\n-30\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n-40\n0\n-50\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\nAtomic number\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\nAtomic number\n\n(a) L1\n\n(b) L2\n15\n\nDifference (eV)\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n-5\n\n-10\n\n-15\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\nAtomic number\n\n(c) L3\n\nFigure 2.

Both analyses involve comparisons with experimental data\nand a comparative appraisal of the accuracy of the various compilations.\nThe evaluations of effects on dependent simulated quantities represent a significant set of\nscenarios to characterize the problem domain, although they are not intended to exhaust all the\npossible present and future uses of atomic binding energies in radiation transport codes. The test\ncases are chosen to address simulation observables that depend directly and explicitly on electron\nbinding energies; this requirement is essential to avoid the risk of introducing a possible bias in\nthe evaluation process due to other physics modeling features than the binding energies subject to\nassessment. The test cases concern quantities that can be directly measured, so that the simulation\noutcome can be compared with experimental data to evaluate the contribution of different atomic\nbinding energies to the achieved accuracy.

Various statistical tools are exploited to quantify the accuracy of the distributions examined in this study and the difference (or equivalence) of the various binding energy compilations;\nGoodness-of-fit tests mentioned in the following sections utilize the Statistical Toolkit [52,53].\nWhenever applicable, multiple goodness-of-fit tests are applied to mitigate the risk of systematic\neffects in the conclusions of the analysis due to peculiarities of the mathematical formulation of the\nvarious methods.\nA combination of Student's t-test and F-test is applied to study the distribution of differences\nbetween the data subject to evaluation and reference values, when goodness-of-fit tests do not\nexhibit adequate discriminant power over some analyzed data samples. The t-test is utilized to\nestimate the compatibility with null mean difference, while, once the sample exhibiting the narrowest distribution of differences (i.e. the lowest variance) has been singled out, the F-test is used\nto identify the data samples whose variance is statistically equivalent to the narrowest distribution.\nThe binding energies listed in the various compilations are given with respect to different\nreferences (vacuum or Fermi level). In the following comparisons the original values are corrected\nto account for the work function as appropriate to ensure a consistent reference. Values of the\nwork function are taken from the compilation of the CRC Handbook of Physics and Chemistry\n[21], which is considered an authoritative source for these data in experimental practice; they are\ncomplemented by data from [54] and [55] for elements not included in the compilation of [21].\nThe analyses reported in the following sections concern elements with atomic number between\n1 and 92, unless differently specified. This range ensures uniform treatment of the various com-\n\n\u20138\u2013\n\n\fpilations in their comparative appraisal, since all the examined compilations cover these elements,\nwhile only a subset of them deal with transuranic elements. Moreover, established experimental\nreferences of transuranic elements suitable for the analysis of binding energies are scarce.\n\n4. Evaluation of reference binding energies\nComparison with experimental data is the prime method to evaluate the accuracy of simulation\nmodels; this validation method requires reliable experimental measurements as a reference. Three\nauthoritative collections of experimental binding energies (two of which are partially overlapping)\nare used for this purpose; they include values for a limited number of elements and shells, therefore\nthey can validate only part of the content of the compilations mentioned in the previous sections.\n4.1 Comparison with high precision reference data\nExperimental values of elemental binding energies reported in the literarature exhibit significant\ndiscrepancies [56]; they can affect the validation of binding energy compilations.\nInconsistencies in the measurements are mostly due to inadequacies in the calibration of binding energy scales of the various instruments, and are often visible when comparing measurements\nperformed by different laboratories.\nBinding energy measurements may differ also for physical reasons: elemental binding energies differ in the vapour and condensed states, and a chemical shift is present when atoms are\ninvestigated in chemical compound states. Moreover, binding energies for atoms implanted by ion\nbombardment into a metal foil substrate are shifted with respect to those for a foil of the pure element. Measurements on different surfaces of a crystal can result in different ionization energy\nvalues.\nThese effects may be sources of systematic errors, which can be significant when comparing\nthe binding energies collected in the various compilations with experimental values.\nA further source of uncertainties derives from the conversion between binding energy values\nof solids referenced to the Fermi level and to the vacuum level; this operation involves adding, or\nsubtracting, the value of the work function.\nA collection of high precision binding energies [57] was assembled by Powell for the purpose\nof constituting a reference for the NIST X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy Database [58]. Data\npublished by different laboratories were subject to a retroactive calibration procedure; the original experimental values were corrected to produce a set of 61 binding energy values, concerning\nelements with atomic numbers between 4 and 84 and shells from K to N. The uncertainty of the\nreference energies is reported to be 0.061 eV [57]. These high precision data have been used to\nevaluate the accuracy of the binding energy compilations examined in this study.\nThe difference of the binding energies in the various compilations with respect to the reference\nvalues of [57] is shown in figure 4(a); the relative difference with respect to the same data is\nshown in figure 4(b). EADL binding energies appear less accurate than the samples from other\ncompilations and exhibit a systematic shift with respect to the reference values.\nIt is worthwhile to remark that no quantitative, systematic validation of EADL binding energies has been reported yet in the literature. EADL documentation [17] states in a section devoted\nto the accuracy of the data that \"by comparing subshell parameters from a number of different\n\n\u20139\u2013\n\n\fsources, it can be seen that there is still a disagreement of about 1% between the binding energies\";\nnevertheless this statement is not supported by any objective demonstration, either directly in the\ndocumentation itself or through references to the literature. EADL documentation does not specify\nwhether the other sources considered in the above statement were other theoretical calculations, or\nempirical compilations, or experimental data.\n15\n22.5\n12.5\n\n20\n17.5\n\n7.5\n\n15\n\n5\n\nEntries\n\nDifference (eV)\n\n10\n\n2.5\n0\n\n12.5\n10\n7.5\n\n-2.5\n\n5\n\n-5\n\n2.5\n\n-7.5\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\nAtomic number Z\n\n0\n\n-0.04\n\n-0.02\n\n0\n\n0.02\n\n0.04\n\n0.06\n\n0.08\n\n0.1\n\n0.12\n\n0.14\n\nRelative difference\n\n(a) Difference\n\n(b) Relative difference\n\nFigure 4.

It is worthwhile to remark that the power\nof goodness-of-fit tests is still a subject of research in statistics.\nOn the other hand, the \u03c7 2 statistic [65] based on the uncertainties of the reference data reported\nin [57] (0.061 eV) results in p-values much smaller than 0.001 for all the binding energy samples;\ntherefore the \u03c7 2 test would reject the hypothesis of compatibility of any compilation with the\nreference data sample with 0.001 significance.\nThe outcome of the \u03c7 2 test depends critically on the correct estimate of the uncertainties of the\ndata subject to test. The procedure applied in [57] to build the reference data sample mitigates the\nrisk of possible systematic effects due to instrumental calibration, which may affect raw experimental data; nevertheless, other sources, independent from the intrinsic precision of the measurement,\nmay contribute to the overall uncertainty.\nPreviously mentioned physical and chemical shifts of the experimental data, associated with\nthe conditions of the measurements, may introduce systematic effects. In this context, one should\n\n\u2013 10 \u2013\n\n\ftake into account that, while the reference values in [57] reflect the experimental configuration\nand instrumental energy resolution for each measured material, the data tabulated in the various\nempirical compilations are the result of manipulations, such as interpolations, extrapolations and\nfits, over large collections of heterogeneous experimental data from multiple sources: the generic\nbinding energy estimates deriving from these procedures may not adequately account for the peculiarities of experimental mesurements performed in specific physical and chemical configurations.\nThe calculation of the \u03c7 2 test statistic includes only the uncertainties associated with Powell's\nreference data; it does not account for errors associated with the binding energies of the various\ncompilations.\nA further source of uncertainty is associated with the work function in cases where a conversion between the Fermi and vacuum reference level should be applied for consistency between\nthe distributions subject to comparison. Moreover, experimental values of the work function are\naffected by the technique of measurement and the cleanliness of the surface. The CRC compilation does not report the uncertainties of the work functions; therefore this additional error cannot\nbe included in the computation of the \u03c7 2 test statistic concerning Carlson's and EADL binding\nenergies.\nDue to these considerations, caution should be exercised in interpreting the outcome of the \u03c7 2\ntest as physically significant, as the nominal uncertainties values involved in the calculation may\nnot realistically represent the actual uncertainties associated with the tested data samples.\nOther statistical methods than goodness-of-fit testing were exploited to quantify the compatibility between the various binding energies compilations and the reference data of [57].\nA Student's t-test was performed to estimate whether the differences between the binding\nenergies of the various compilations and the corresponding reference values are compatible with a\ntrue mean of zero. The p-values resulting from this test are summarized in Table 1. The binding\nenergies of Williams' and 1979 Sevier's compilations are compatible at 0.05 level of significance\nwith null mean difference with respect to the reference data; the t-test rejects the hypothesis of\ncompatibility with zero mean difference with 0.01 significance for all the other compilations. It\nshould be stressed that these tests, as well as similar ones reported in the following, do not compare\nthe compilations with each other, but how well they reproduce the set of precision reference data.\nAll the binding energies compilations exhibit rather large differences with respect to the reference data for rare gases (Ar, Xe and Kr) reported in [57], that derive from implants in other media.\nIf one excludes these data from the t-test, also Bearden and Burr's binding energies are compatible\nwith zero mean difference with respect to the reference data at 0.05 significance level.\nThe binding energies of Williams' compilation exhibit the narrowest distribution of differences\nwith respect to the reference data of [57], as can be seen in figure 4(b). The standard deviations\nrelated to the various compilations are listed in Table 2, excluding the data for argon, xenon and\nkrypton, which are treated as outliers. The table also reports the p-values of the F-test to evaluate\nthe hypothesis of equality of variance associated with the various compilations with respect to\nthe binding energies of Williams' compilation; the distributions subject to the F-test concern the\ndifference between the binding energies in the compilations and the reference data of [57]. The\nstatistical analysis confirms the qualitative evidence of figure 4(b), since the null hypothesis is\nrejected with 0.01 significance level for all the test cases.\n\n\u2013 11 \u2013\n\n\fTable 1.

This collection consists of 85\nvalues; it includes most of the reference binding energies discussed in [57], along with additional\ndata, mainly concerning outer shells than those reported in [57]. The data for noble gases listed\nin [57] are not included in this set of recommended values.\nFigure 5 shows the difference between the binding energies of the various compilations and\nthe NIST recommended values.\nThe comparison with these reference data adopts a similar method to the one described in the\nprevious section.\nThe p-values resulting from Student's t-test for compatibility with zero mean difference with\nrespect to the reference data are reported in Table 3. The binding energy samples extracted from the\nWilliams' and Sevier's 1979 compilations are compatible with zero mean difference at 0.05 level\nof significance; those from the two editions of the Table of Isotopes are compatible at 0.01 level.\nSimilarly to the previous case, the distribution of differences with the lowest standard deviation is\nthe one associated with Williams' compilation.\nThe standard deviations of the distributions of differences from the reference data are reported\nfor all the data samples in Table 4, together with the p-values of the F-test for the equality of variance with respect to the distribution associated with Williams' compilation.

It should be stressed, however, that the NIST reference\nsample represents a small subset of the periodic system of elements: approximately 6% of the total\nnumber of shells of elements with atomic number up to 92.\n4.3 Evaluation of ionization energies\nThe ionization energy (in the past referred to as ionization potential), is the least energy that is\nnecessary to remove an electron from a a free, unexcited, neutral atom, or an additional electron\n\n\u2013 13 \u2013\n\n\fTable 4.

In the following analysis it is considered to be equal to the binding energy\nof the least bound electron in the atom.\nA compilation of reference experimental ionization potentials is available from NIST [28]; the\nsame values are also reported in the Table of Isotopes [18] in a table distinct from the compilation of electron binding energies and in the CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics [21]. This\ncompilation does not list the uncertainties of the ionization energies it collects, but NIST web site\ncomments that they range from less than one unit in the last digit of the given values to more than\n0.2 eV.\nThe lowest binding energies for each element in the various compilations have been compared\nto the reference ionization energies collected by NIST. The compilations of the 1978 edition of the\nTable of Isotopes and Williams do not include many outer-shell binding energies; this limitation\nmay be related to the emphasis of these compilations on experimental effects related to inner shells,\nlike measurements concerning X-ray fluorescence or Auger electron emission. Therefore the following analysis was restricted to the compilations of Bearden and Burr, Carlson, EADL, Sevier\n1979 and 1996 edition of the Table of Isotopes, which list a full set of electron binding energies.\nThe difference between ionization energies derived from the various compilations and NIST\nreference data is shown in figure 6. Carlson's binding energies appear to be in closest agreement\nwith NIST ionization energies.\nGoodness of fit tests are sensitive to the differences exhibited by the various compilations\nwith respect to the NIST reference collection. The results of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov, AndersonDarling and Cramer-von Mises tests are listed in Table 5. The hypothesis of compatibility with\nNIST reference data is rejected by all the tests with 0.001 significance for EADL and Bearden\nand Burr's data. Carlson's compilations and the Table of Isotopes 1996 are compatible with the\nreference data at 0.05 significance level according to all the tests. Regarding Sevier's 1979 compilation, the Anderson-Darling test rejects the hypothesis of compatibility at 0.05 significance level,\nwhile the Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Cramer-von Mises test do not; the different response of these\ntests near the critical region of 0.05 significance could be explained by the greater sensitivity of the\nAnderson-Darling test statistic to fat tails.\n\n\u2013 14 \u2013\n\n\f50\n\nEntries\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n\n-5\n\n-4\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nDifference (eV)\n\nFigure 6.

Effects on fluorescence X-ray energies\nCompilations of characteristic X-ray energies are available, at least for lines of experimental interest, which in principle could be used in Monte Carlo simulation to determine the energy of\nsecondary products of atomic relaxation. Nevertheless, these experimental tabulations can hardly\nsatisfy the requirements of general purpose Monte Carlo codes, which require the ability of generating any atomic transition for any element. The energies of X-rays and Auger electrons resulting\nfrom atomic relaxation are often computed by Monte Carlo codes as the difference between the\nbinding energies of the shells involved in the transition; in this approximation the binding energies\nof the atom in an ionised state are assumed to be the same as in the ground state. Therefore the\naccuracy of the simulation of the secondary products of atomic relaxation is determined by the\naccuracy of the binding energies implemented in the Monte Carlo system (apart from the physical\napproximation of neglecting the difference between the binding energies of an ionised atom and a\n\n\u2013 15 \u2013\n\n\fneutral one in the ground state).\nThe accuracy of the examined binding energy compilations to reproduce the energy of atomic\nrelaxation products has been estimated with respect to the experimental X-ray energies reported in\nthe review by Deslattes et al. [67], which concerns K and L transitions.\nA comparison of X-ray energies calculated by Geant4, based on EADL binding energies, with\nrespect to the same experimental data is documented in [68]. That study showed that, according\nto the outcome of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, all the X-ray energies simulated by Geant4 are\ncompatible with the experimental data with 0.1 significance for all transitions and all elements;\nthe relative difference between simulated and experimental values is approximately 1-2% for most\nindividual transitions. The present study is extended to binding energy compilations other than\nEADL.\nA selection of representative plots of the relative difference between calculated X-ray energies\nand the experimental data of [67] is shown in figures 7-10; X-ray energies are calculated from the\nvarious compilations of binding energies. It is evident from the plots that the energies calculated\nby EADL appear less accurate than those based on the other compilations. Nevertheless, as already\nfound in [68], the discrepancies of the energies deriving from EADL with respect to measurements\nare quite small (less than 2% in general).\nSimilarly to what has been discussed in the previous section, goodness-of-fit tests based on\nthe empirical distribution function are not sensitive to such small differences: the hypothesis of\ncompatibility between experimental data and X-ray energies based on EADL (the compilation that\nis evidently responsible for the largest discrepancies) is not rejected at 0.1 level of significance [68].\nThe \u03c7 2 test has limited discriminant power as well, due to the small uncertainties of the experimental reference data in [67] (less than 0.1 eV for some transitions), which lead to the rejection of\nthe null hypothesis of compatibility between calculated and experimental X-ray energies in a large\nnumber of test cases. It is hard to ascertain whether this result of the \u03c7 2 test is due to underestimated uncertainties for some transitions and elements, or reflects a realistic conclusion that X-ray\nenergies calculated from binding energy differences do not achieve the same accuracy by which\nX-ray energies are experimentally measured.\nSimilarly to what was described in the previous section, a t-test was applied to evaluate whether\nthe distribution of differences between calculated and experimental X-ray energies is compatible\nwith a true mean of zero. For each transition the t-test was performed over all the elements for\nwhich experimental values are reported in [67]; the fraction of test cases for each transition for\nwhich the hypothesis of compatibility is not rejected with 0.05 significance is listed in Table 6.\nThe largest number of test cases where the hypothesis of compatibility with null average difference is not rejected with 0.05 significance is achieved by the compilations of the 1996 Table of\nIsotopes and Bearden and Burr's review (44 out of 48 test cases).\nThe hypothesis whether the compatibility of the other binding energy compilations with zero\nmean is equivalent to the one achieved by the 1996 Table of Isotopes and Bearden and Burr's\nreview was tested by means of contingency tables. Contingency tables were built by counting in\nhow many t-test cases the rejection of the null hypothesis occurs, or does not occur; these counts\nare respectively identified as \"fail\" or \"pass\". The results concerning K and L shells are summed to\nobtain a larger sample size. They were analyzed by means of Fisher's exact test [70], Pearson's \u03c7 2\ntest (whenever the number of entries in each cell justifies the use of this test) and the \u03c7 2 test with\n\n\u2013 16 \u2013\n\n\fTable 6.

The contingency table concerning the comparison of EADL and\nthe 1996 Table of Isotopes is reported in Table 7, along with the p-values of the three tests applied\nto it.\nThe hypothesis of equivalence with respect to the results of the t-test is rejected with 0.05\nsignificance for EADL; it is not rejected for Carlson's, Sevier's and Williams' compilations. The\noutcome of the tests is controversial for the contingency table concerning the 1996 and 1978 editions of the Table of Isotopes: the p-values are 0.050 for Fisher's exact test, 0.039 for Person's \u03c7 2\ntest and 0.075 for the \u03c7 2 with Yates' continuity correction. The compatibility between EADL and\nthe the 1996 Table of Isotopes is excluded even if a looser 0.01 significance for the rejection of the\nnull hypothesis is set both in the t-test and in the contingency tables.\nThe distribution of the difference between the X-ray energies calculated from binding energy\ntabulations and the experimental values of [67] is wider for EADL than for all the other compilations; this result can be appreciated in a few representative plots (figures 5-12).\nThe equivalence of the variance of the differences between calculated and experimental X-ray\nenergies was estimated by means of the F-test. For each transition, the variance of the corresponding data sample was compared to the variance associated with the 1996 Table of Isotopes, which\nexhibits the narrowest distribution of differences between calculated and experimental X-ray energies. The hypothesis of equivalence of the variances under test was rejected if the p-value from\nthe F-test was smaller than 0.01.

Effects on ionization cross sections\nSome analytical formulations of cross sections for the ionization of atoms by charged particle impact involve atomic binding energies. Two of these models are considered in this study to ascertain\nwhether different binding energy compilations would produce significant differences in the cross\n\n\u2013 21 \u2013\n\n\fsection values: the Binary-Encounter-Bethe model (BEB) [73] for electron impact ionization and\nthe ECPSSR (Energy Loss Coulomb Repulsion Perturbed Stationary State Relativistic) model [74]\nfor proton impact ionization. For both models the effects on the accuracy of the cross section\ncalculations are quantitatively estimated through a comparison with experimental data.\n6.1 Electron impact ionization cross sections\nTwo models of electron impact cross sections, the Binary-Encounter-Bethe [73] model and the\nDeutsch-M\u00e4rk model [75], have been designed, implemented and validated in view of extending\nand improving Geant4 simulation capabilities in the energy range below 1 keV. Their features,\nverification and validation are briefly summarized in [76, 77] and extensively documented in a\ndedicated paper [78]. The first software development cycle has been focussed on modeling total\nionization cross sections; the validation process and the analysis of the effect of atomic binding\nenergies concern these calculations, although the BEB model has the capability of calculating cross\nsections for the ionisation of individual shells.\nThe BEB cross section for the ionization of subshell i is given by:\n\u0013\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0015\nlog(t)\n1 log(t)\n1\nS\n1\u2212 2 +1\u2212 \u2212\n(6.1)\n\u03c3i =\nt + (u + 1)/n\n2\nt\nt\nt +1\nwhere:\nT\nt= ,\nB\n\nU\nu= ,\nB\n\nS=\n\n4\u03c0 a20 N\n\n\u0012 \u00132\nR\nB\n\n(6.2)\n\nIn the above equations B is the electron binding energy, N is the the occupation number, T is the\nincident electron energy, U is the average electron kinetic energy, t and u are normalized incident\nand kinetic energies, n is the principal quantum number (only taken into account when larger than\n2), a0 is the Bohr radius and R is the Rydberg constant. The sum over all the subshells i of an atom\ngives the total (counting) cross section; in practice, only the valence shell and a few outer subshells\ncontribute significantly to determine the cross section value.\nThe original BEB cross sections [73] used binding energy values calculated by the authors of\nthe model. Only a few of those values are documented in [73]; they were utilized in the software\nverification process to assess the correctness of the implementation, but such a small set is inadequate for using the model in a general purpose simulation system, which must be able to calculate\ncross sections for any target atoms. The BEB model developed for use with Geant4 utilizes a full\nset of binding energies and provides the option of accessing alternative compilations.\nThe analysis addressed two issues: the sensitivity of cross sections to the values of the binding\nenergies used in the calculation, and the evaluation of the accuracy with respect to experimental\ndata.\nTwo examples of the effects of different binding energies on the calculated cross sections are\nshown in figure 13. They illustrate three options of binding energies: Lotz's compilation, which is\nalso used by the Deutsch-M\u00e4rk model, EADL data for all shells and EADL with ionization potentials replaced by NIST values [28] (identified in the following as \"modified EADL\"). Lotz's compilation is identical to Carlson's apart from a few exceptions; according to the analysis in section\n4.3, Carlson's compilation appears the most accurate with respect to NIST ionization potentials,\nwhile EADL exhibits the largest differences with respect to other compilations in both inner and\n\n\u2013 22 \u2013\n\n\fouter-shell binding energies. Significant differences are visible in the cross sections, when different\nionization energies are used in the calculation, while different inner-shell binding energies appear\nto have relatively small effects.\n\n3.5\n\n9\n8\n\nCross section (10-16cm2)\n\n2\n\ncm )\n\n3\n\nCross section (10\n\n-16\n\n2.5\n\n2\n\n1.5\n\n1\n\n7\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n0\n10\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n3\n\nEnergy (eV)\n\n0\n10\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n3\n\nEnergy (eV)\n\n(a) Nitrogen\n\n(b) Germanium\n\nFigure 13. BEB electron impact ionization cross section, BEB model with EADL binding energies for all\nshells (empty circles), BEB model with EADL binding energies except for ionization energies replaced by\nNIST values (empty squares), BEB model with Lotz binding energies (asterisks) and experimental data: (a)\nfrom [106] (red squares), [107] (black circles) and [108] (green stars), (b) from [121] (black circles).\n\nThe effect of these three options, which can be considered as extreme alternatives in the BEB\ncalculation, has been quantified through a statistical analysis.\nFirst, cross sections calculated with different binding energies were compared via goodnessof-fit tests; the test concerned all elements with atomic number between 1 and 92, and incident\nelectron energies from 1 eV to 10 keV, divided in two ranges: those up to 100 eV, and those above.\nThe results of the comparisons are summarized in Tables 9 and 10. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test\nappears the most sensitive to differences in the cross sections deriving from the considered binding\nenergy options. The hypothesis of compatibility between cross sections calculated with Lotz's\nbinding energies and with modified EADL is rejected with 0.05 significance only for a few heavy\nelements (with Z>80) in the lower energy range (below 100 eV): this result indicates that total\nionization cross sections are marginally affected by inner-shell binding energies. The hypothesis\nof compatibility between the cross sections based on EADL and modified EADL is rejected in a\nlarger number of test cases, especially in the lower energy range: this result shows that the cross\nsections are sensitive to the values of the ionization potential.\nThe following analysis evaluated whether different ionization potentials would significantly\naffect the accuracy of the calculated cross sections with respect to experimental data. The effects of\ndifferent ionization energies on the accuracy of the calculation are not straightforward to ascertain\nfrom a qualitative appraisal of the data: in fact, within the data sample one can identify test cases\nwhere either configuration - with NIST values or with EADL original values - appears to better reproduce the experimental data as shown, for instance, in figure 13. Therefore a statistical analysis\nwas performed, examining the compatibility with experiment of two sets of BEB cross sections,\n\n\u2013 23 \u2013\n\n\fTable 9.

The two sets of cross sections were compared to the same experimental measurements [79]- [168], consisting of more than 120 individual data sets and concerning more than\n50 elements. The comparison with experimental data exploits goodness-of-fit tests (KolmogorovSmirnov, Anderson-Darling, Cramer-von Mises and \u03c7 2 ); their significance was set to 0.05. The\ntest was articulated over five distinct energy ranges below 1 keV to appraise in detail the accuracy\nof the calculated cross sections.\nThe number of test cases for which the null hypothesis of compatibility between calculated and\nmeasured cross sections is rejected, or not rejected, is reported in Table 11 for the two examined\nbinding energy options. Below 1 keV the hypothesis of compatibility with experimental data is\nalways rejected in a smaller number of test cases when the cross section calculation utilizes NIST\nionization energies instead of EADL original ones. No difference is observed above 1 keV.\nThe analysis by means of contingency tables does not reject the hypothesis of equivalence\nbetween the two cross section categories at reproducing experimental data in any of the considered\nenergy ranges. Nevertheless, the probability that the better performance associated with NIST\nionization energies in all five trials could be due to chance only is 0.03.\n6.2 Proton impact ionization cross sections\nA similar study was performed on proton ionization cross sections. Several cross section models\nfor the computation of inner-shell ionization by proton and \u03b1 particle impact have been released\nin Geant4 version 9.4 [43]; they include calculations based on the plane wave Born approximation\n(PWBA) [169], the ECPSSR (Energy-loss Coulomb Perturbed Stationary State Relativistic) model\n[74] in a number of variants and a collection of empirical models, deriving from fits to experimental\ndata. The PWBA and ECPSSR cross sections (in all their variants) exploit tabulations produced by\nthe ISICS (Inner-Shell Ionization Cross Sections) code [44] for K, L and M shells.\n\n\u2013 24 \u2013\n\n\fTable 11.

The ECPSSR cross section for a given shell\nis expressed in terms of the PWBA value:\n\uf8eb \u0010\u03be \u0011\n\uf8f6\nmR \u03b6 \u03b7\n\u03c3ECPSSR = CBE (dq0 B \u03b6 )\u03c3PWBA \uf8ed\n,\u03b6\u03b8\uf8f8\n(6.7)\n(\u03b6 \u03b8 )2\nwhere CEB is the Coulomb deflection correction, \u03b6 is the correction factor for binding energy and\npolarization effects, mR is the relativistic correction, q0 is the minimum momentum transfer and\n\n\u03be = v1\n\nZ2\nU2\n\nv1 being the projectile velocity.\n\n\u2013 25 \u2013\n\n(6.8)\n\n\fThe PWBA and ECPSSR cross section tabulations distributed with the Geant4 code were produced with the ISICS 2008 version, which uses the Bearden and Burr binding energies. Recent\nupdates to ISICS [49] offer the option of using Williams' compilation of binding energies as alternative values to the default Bearden and Burr's ones; a further evolution of ISICS [170] lets the user\nspecify an arbitrary source of atomic binding energies, thus providing access to any of the options\nanalyzed in this paper. This version, which was used to produce the data for this paper, involves\nnew implementations of some parts of the ISICS code, which contribute to the numerical correctness and computational robustness of the software. The new features and verification of this new\nversion of ISICS are documented in [170]. The experimental validation of cross sections generated\nby this new version of ISICS produces consistent results with those reported in [43], when the two\ncode versions are run in the same configuration.\nCross sections calculated by ISICS 2011 version using different binding energy compilations\nexhibit differences; some examples, concerning K and L shells, are shown in figures 14-16. The\ndifferences appear larger for light elements and K shell.\n\n0.05\n\n0.1\n\n0.04\n0.03\n\nRelative difference\n\nRelative difference\n\n0.05\n\n0\n\n-0.05\n\n-0.1\n\n0.02\n0.01\n0\n-0.01\n-0.02\n-0.03\n\n-0.15\n\n-0.04\n-0.2\n-2\n10\n\n10\n\n-0.05\n\n-1\n\n1\n\n10\n\n10\n\nE (MeV)\n\n-1\n\n1\n\n10\n\nE (MeV)\n\n(a) Carbon\n\n(b) Copper\n\nFigure 14.

The use of EADL binding energies results in fewer test cases that are compatible with\nmeasurements; the hypothesis of equivalent accuracy of cross sections based on EADL with those\nbased on other compilations is rejected with 0.05 significance for all the alternative binding energies.

The comparison of L shell cross sections with experimental data\ndoes not identify any significant differences associated with the use of different binding energies;\nthe fraction of tested elements for which L shell cross sections calculated with various binding\nenergies are compatible with experimental data is listed in Table 14.\nThe scarcity of experimental measurements prevents a similar analysis on the effect of binding\nenergies on M shell ionization cross sections.\n\n\u2013 28 \u2013\n\n\fTable 12.

Effects on Compton scattering\nDoppler broadening of photon energy spectra arises from Compton scattering between photons\nand moving electrons bound to atoms of the target medium. Algorithms to account for Doppler\nbroadening are implemented in widely used Monte Carlo systems: those included in EGS [174],\n\n\u2013 29 \u2013\n\n\f3000\n\n2500\n\nCounts\n\n2000\n\n1500\n\n1000\n\n500\n\n0\n\n30\n\n31\n\n32\n\n33\n\n34\n\n35\n\n36\n\n37\n\n38\n\n39\n\n40\n\nEnergy (MeV)\n\nFigure 17. Energy distribution of photons between 89\u25e6 and 91\u25e6 resulting from Compton scattering of 40\nkeV photons orthogonally impinging onto a silicon target, obtained using EADL (red) and Carlson's (black)\nbinding energies in the simulation. The two histograms associated with either binding energy options are\npractically undistinguishable.\n\nMCNP [175] and Geant4 [176] are based on the method described in [174]; the algorithm implemented in Penelope produces equivalent results [176].\nA test was performed to ascertain if different binding energy compilations would affect the calculated energy distributions of Compton scattering generated in the simulation. The test concerned\na few target materials relevant to Compton telescopes [177], silicon, germanium and xenon, which\nare characterized by different experimental resolutions related to the effects of Doppler broadening.\nFor this investigation, the original implementation of Compton scattering with Doppler broadening\nin Geant4 and associated unit test [176] was used. The analysis compared the spectra deriving from\ntwo sets of binding energies: those used in the simulation, which derive from EADL, and Carlson's\ncompilation. The latter was chosen as its binding energies for the considered elements exhibit the\nlargest difference with respect to EADL ones among the various examined compilations.\nNo significant effect was visible in the spectra of the scattered photons as a result of simulations using different binding energy compilations. An example is illustrated in figure 17, which\nshows the energy spectrum of photons between 89\u25e6 and 91\u25e6 resulting from Compton scattering of\n40 keV photons orthogonally impinging onto a silicon target.\nPearson's \u03c7 2 test confirms the equivalence of the Doppler broadened photon spectra based on\nEADL and Carlson's binding energies; the p-value resulting from this test is 1 for all the three\ntarget materials.\nTherefore, based on this investigation, one can conclude that the choice of binding energy\ncompilation is not critical for the simulation of Compton scattering accounting for Doppler broadening.\n\n8.

The origin of the data for each element and shell\nis documented in the form of comments in the code implementation. The authors of this paper\ncould not retrieve a copy of the latter reference, which has been superseded by more recent editions\n(the most recent one at the time of writing this paper is the 91st edition); nevertheless, most of\nthe values identified in the comments to the code as originating from [36] appear consistent with\nthose published in the most recent version of the Handbook, which includes Williams' compilation. A few values in G4AtomicShells, however, are consistent with neither Carlson's nor Williams'\ncompilations.\nThe two sources, Carlson's and Williams' compilations, report binding energies based on different reference levels: the vacuum level for Carlson's data and the Fermi level for Williams'\ndata. Data referring to different reference levels are associated with shells of the same element\nin G4AtomicShells. The inconsistency of the data in the G4AtomicShells class may generate systematic effects in physics observables; some examples are illustrated in figures 18 and 19. These\nplots show the differences between X-ray energies calculated from G4AtomicShells binding energies and the experimental data of Deslattes et al. [67], along with X-ray energies calculated from\nCarlson's and Williams' compilations: the X-ray energies based on G4AtomicShells exhibit some\nsystematic shifts with respect to the experimental data, while the X-ray energies based on Carlson's and Williams' compilations do not appear affected by such systematic discrepancies with\nmeasurements. The systematic effect is so large, that statistical tests appear redundant to identify\nits occurrence.\n\n9. Conclusion\nA survey of compilations of atomic binding energies compilations used by general purpose Monte\nCarlo transport codes and other specialized software systems has been performed.

KM2 transition, difference between X-ray energies calculated from binding energies and experimental data from [67]: binding energies from G4AtomicShells (red shaded histogram), Carlson (blue solid\nline histogram) and Williams (black dashed line histogram).\n\ntions are based on experimental data; the only exception among those considered in this study is\nEADL, which is the result of theoretical calculations.\nThe accuracy of these compilation has been evaluated through direct comparisons with experimental data and through their effects on related physical quantities used in particle transport and\nexperimental observables.\nThe results of this study show that no single compilation is ideal for all applications.\nDirect comparisons with reference experimental data, which concern a subset of K, L, M and\nN shells, identify Williams' compilation, included in the X-ray Data Booklet and CRC Handbook\nof Physics and Chemistry, as the one best agreeing with experimental values. Regarding outer\nshells, ionization energies appear to be best reproduced by Carlson's compilation; Lotz's ionization\nenergies are identical to Carlson's for elements with atomic number up to 92.\nK and L shell X-ray energies are more accurately calculated based on the binding energies\nreported in the 1996 Table of Isotopes. With respect to these binding energies, the X-ray energies\nderived from the compilations by Bearden and Burr, Sevier and Williams do not exhibit any statistically significant disagreement in compatibilility with average zero difference from experiment.\nRegarding the variance of such differences, the various compilations, with the exception of EADL,\nare equivalent to the 1996 Table of Isotopes in 60% to 79% of the transitions. X-ray energies based\non EADL, although less accurate than those produced by other compilations, differ from the experimental references by less than 2% for most transitions: such an inaccuracy can be tolerable in\nsome experimental applications, while others, where accuracy of simulated X-ray energies is important, should utilize the 1996 Table of Isotopes or other compilations providing better accuracy\nthan EADL in this domain.\nTotal cross sections for electron impact ionization addressing the energy range below 1 keV\n(relevant to microdosimetry applications) are sensitive to the values of ionization potentials, while\nthey are marginally influenced by inner shell binding energies. Lotz-Carlson's compilation and\nEADL modified to include NIST experimental ionization energies exhibit equivalent behaviour,\n\n\u2013 32 \u2013\n\n\fwhile the use of EADL original ionization energies substantially decreases the accuracy of the\ncross section calculation.\nK shell ionization cross sections by proton impact are sensitive to the binding energy values\nused in the ECPSSR calculation. All the empirical binding energy compilations produce results\ncompatible with experimental measurements, while cross sections based on EADL show statistically significant worse accuracy. Binding energies also affect the calculation of ECPSSR cross\nsections for the L shell, but the differences are smaller than for the K shell; the uncertainties of L\nshell experimental data are too large to appreciate the effect of different binding energies in terms\nof modeling accuracy.\nThe simulation of Doppler broadening in Compton scattering appears insensitive to the choice\nof binding energies among the examined compilations.\nIt is worthwhile to stress that these quantitative conclusions were not previously documented\nin the literature.\nSimulation applications with high precision requirements may profit from the results documented in this paper to identify the optimal set of binding energies for specific scenarios (e.g.\nmaterial analysis, microdosimetry, PIXE etc.). Simulations applications not characterized by high\nprecision requirements may be satisfied by any of the compilations. Monte Carlo kernel developers\nmay profit form the results documented in this paper to optimize the accuracy of the physics models\nthey deliver to the experimental user community for applications.\nAs no single compilation is suitable for all applications, it is highly desirable for simulation\npackages to allow experimentalists to choose which compilation to use for their application. This\nis much more easily possible in packages which read their binding energy data from file at runtime, rather than hard-coding it into the application binaries as in GEANT 3 and Geant4 materials\npackage.\nEADL binding energies appear consistently associated with worse accuracy in all the test\ncases analysed in this paper. An evolution of EADL to better reflect the state-of-the-art would be\ndesirable; it has already been advocated in [178] regarding the improvement of radiative transition\nprobabilities. However, modifications to EADL should preserve the consistency with two other\nrelated data libraries, EEDL (Evaluated Electron Data Library) [39] and EPDL (Evaluated Photon Data Library) [40], as these compilations are intended to provide a consistent set of data for\nelectron-photon trasport calculations.\n\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors express their gratitude to CERN for support to the research described in this paper.\nThe CERN Library, in particular Tullio Basaglia, has provided helpful assistance and essential\nreference material for this study.
