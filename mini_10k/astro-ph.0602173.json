These stars spend most of\ntheir lifetimes in the hot part of the HRD, either as O (H-burning) or Wolf-Rayet (WR:\n1\n\nBased on observations made with the NASA-CNES-CSA Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer.

Although hot-star winds were suspected to be inhomogeneous\n(e.g. Cherepashchuk et al. 1984), truly direct evidence came only from the detection of\nstochastic, systematically moving subpeaks on the strong emission lines of WR stars (Moffat\net al. 1988). This profoundly changed the approach in atmospheric modeling of WR stars\n(e.g. Hillier 1991; Hamann & Koesterke 1998, Hillier & Miller 1999) and resulted in a\nsubstantial reduction, by a factor 2-5, of predicted mass-loss rates. A similar factor may also\napply to O-star winds (e.g. Eversberg et al. 1998, Donati et al. 2002, Fullerton, Massa &\nPrinja 2005). Since the evolution of massive stars is heavily affected by mass-loss, such a\nsignificant reduction in mass-loss rate called for a major revision in models of massive stars\nand stimulated further research (see Meynet & Maeder 2005, and references therein).\nAlthough the consequences of wind inhomogeneities for mass-loss estimates are understood, the origin of the clumps is not. It is almost certain that radiative instabilities (e.g.\nOwocki 1994) must ultimately lead to supersonic, compressible turbulence (Henriksen 1994).\nThen it is reasonable to assume that the resulting shocks will generate the X-ray fluxes seen\nemanating (e.g. Berghoefer et al. 1997, Wessolowski 1996) from all hot-star winds. Linking\nshocks to X-rays, one should look for a stochastic variablility of X-ray flux, expecting that\nrather infrequent shock-shock collisions are the most influential events in X-ray production\n(Feldmeier et al. 1997). However, no X-ray facility is sensitive enough yet to detect such\nfluctuations (Bergh\u00f6fer et al. 1997). In addition, the situation is complicated by the large\noptical depth of the outflows from WR stars. While the clumps are routinely observed at\n<\nthe base of the wind r\u223c\n100 R\u22c6 where the emission lines arise, the [presumably related] X-ray\nflux emerges from r \u226b 100 R\u22c6 .\nIn order to establish that embedded shocks are responsible for the clumpy structure of\nhot-star winds, one may rely on observations of resonance lines of \"super-ions,\" i.e., ions\nwhose presence cannot be explained by photoionization in winds characterized by temperatures between 20 and 40 kK (e.g. MacFarlane et al. 1994). The best superionization feature\nis the strong OVI resonance line with \u03c7ioniz = 114-138 eV at 1031.93/37.62 \u00c5 , i.e. accessible\nonly with Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE). If the OVI line feature is formed\nin hot, shocked gas filaments (clumps) permeating the accelerating wind, one should see\na variable profile, with corresponding statistical properties (velocity dispersion, timescales,\namplitudes) resembling those found in optical emission lines, presumably produced via superposition of counltless clumps (L\u00e9pine & Moffat 1999). One may also expect, by analogy\nwith the optical lines, the non-saturated P Cygni absorption parts of the profiles to show\nthe highest level of variability.\nOur target, the presumably single, luminous Wolf-Rayet star WR135 = HD 192103\n(WC8) is known to show a highly variable, structured (clumpy) wind (L\u00e9pine et al. 2000),\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nas well as being an X-ray source (ROSAT: 2.1\u00b11.7[10\u22123 cts s\u22121 ], although barely exceeding a\n1\u03c3 detection limit - see arguments in Oskinova et al. 2003). In this star, as with virtually all\nother WR stars observed in the optical (L\u00e9pine & Moffat 1999), spectral subpeaks are seen to\npropagate outwards towards the edges of strong emission lines. These peaks are interpreted as\ndensity enhancements emitting excess recombination-line radiation, propagating on average\nalong with the general wind outflow. In WR 135 the moving subpeaks typically range up\nto 0.2-2.0% of the underlying emission-line strength, have a radial velocity dispersion \u03c3r =\n175 km s\u22121 , and last for 7.5 hours on average (L\u00e9pine et al. 2000). The spectrum of WR135,\nleaving aside the prominent O VI feature, can be modeled with Tef f (\u03c4Ross = 2/3) = 2.7 104\nK (Dessart et al. 2000). On the other hand, the O VI doublet, the central subject of our\ndiscussion, peaks in strength at T \u223c 3 105 K (Zsarg\u00f3 et al. 2003, Sembach et al. 2004). This\nhigh ionization, two stages above the dominant level (Cassinelli & Olson 1979), is explained\nby Auger ionization in the presence of X-rays generated in numerous wind-embedded shocks.\nHere we report the simultaneous appearence of short-lived (hours) absorption features\nin the high-velocity, blueshifted flanks of all major P Cygni emission profiles (OVI included)\nin the FUSE range. We link these absorption features to strong, highly supersonic shocks\nembedded in the wind of WR 135.\n\n2.\n\nFUSE Observations\n\nWe observed WR 135 with FUSE (Moos et al. 2000, Sahnow et al. 2000) in October\n2004, starting at HJD 2453287.5930 (UT=02:11, Oct. 9), and ending at HJD 2453288.8483\n(UT 08:19, Oct. 10), thus following the star for 30+ hours practically non-stop. The spectra\nwere obtained in histogram (HIST) mode, with the MDRS (4\" \u00d7 20\") aperture, covering\n910-1185 \u00c5 . Initially, 59 exposures (root name D0440101) were scheduled back-to-back over\n18 consecutive orbits. However, for technical reasons, only 42 spectra were obtained, with a\nparticularly large, \u223c 4h gap during planned exposures 15-29, when detectors autonomously\nshut down. Exposures 5 and 55 were skipped because of acquisition problems. The majority\nof exposures were taken with Texp \u223c 500 s. The main setback came from a mis-alignment\nof the SiC channels causing loss of flux. However, the LiF channels performed well. The\nlatest version of CalFUSE (v3.0.7) was used to extract and calibrate spectra from the two\nLiF channels.\nArmed with a large number of spectra of the same object obtained within a short\ntime interval, we tried to maximize the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of individual exposures.\nThe presence of strong, frequently saturated IS absorptions called for minimal usage of any\nbinning in velocity space on the original spectra. However, it did not preclude an appropriate\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nsmoothing of the differences (individual minus average, individual minus individual). We\nassembled the spectra into groups, combining together the A and B segments of the 2 LiF\ndetectors into 4 separate averages and then inter-comparing the averages. Before combining\nthe spectra, we corrected all small-scale deviations (< 3 km s\u22121) in the rest-frame radial\nvelocities of strong interstellar absorption lines. By comparing the averages, we found that\nthe LiF2A and LiF1B segments have practically the same S/N, although the LiF1B flux was\nreduced by 10%. On the other hand, LiF2B has a S/N that is two times lower than that of\nLiF1A. Hence, initially we treated all 4 segments separately, then appropriately combined\nthe processed LiF2A with LiF1B and LiF2B with LiF1A at the very end of the procedure.\nThis also provided an efficient line-by-line cross-check of the suspected variability patterns.\nExperimenting with various grouping algorithms, we finally decided to average all available\nspectra with comparable S/N levels, taking the median values and additionally rejecting\nat each given wavelength the 10 most deviating flux readings (5 maximal and 5 minimal).\nThen the average was subtracted from each individual spectrum, channel-by-channel, and\nthe difference was smoothed with a Gaussian filter. Subtracting the smoothed difference\nfrom the former (thus removing the low-frequency instrumental trends but retaining the\nhigh-frequency signal), and then subtracting this second-order difference from the original\nspectrum (thus reducing the high-frequency noise), we managed to increase the S/N in\neach individual spectrum from the initial \u223c 15 to \u223c 40, without degrading the spectral\nresolution. Finally, by carefully assessing the spectrum-to-spectrum variability, we found\nthat the processed spectra can be assembled into 3 groups (Fig. 1): exposures 1-14 (midtime HJD 2453287.6664), 30-39 (HJD 2453288.1803) and 40-59 (HJD 2453288.6066).\n\n3.\n\nResults and Discussion\n\nDespite the overall improvement in S/N, our detection limits do not exceed 5-10%\n(refering to the ambient continuum), depending on the spectral range, in any individual\nexposure. Fixed-pattern noise, i.e. small-scale and fairly stable, within a few hours, noise\npatterns are mainly responsible for the problem. These detection limits are \u223c a factor of\ntwo lower in the grouped exposures. Within these limits the emission parts of all major\ntransitions can be considered as constant. Recall that in the optical lines the variability\ndoes not exceed \u223c 2% (L\u00e9pine et al. 2000). In Fig. 1 we show the major variable part that of the absorption troughs of the P Cygni profiles. To normalize the velocities, we used\nthe terminal wind velocity v\u221e = 1479 km s\u22121 from Willis et al. (2004), which fits the data\nbetter than v\u221e = 1343 \u00b1 496 km s\u22121 from Niedzielski & Skorzynski (2002).\nFinally we converted the detected variations to the differences of apparent optical depths,\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nd = ln(F 1/F 2) (Savage & Sembach 1991), where F1 is an average of exposures 1-14, and\nF2 is either an average of exposures 30-39 or an average of exposures 40-59 (see Fig.1). To\nreduce the noise, we removed all artefacts introduced by the saturated features (literally, the\nresults of 0/0 division) and smoothed the ratio F1/F2 using a gaussian filter with FWHM=15\npix. The smoothing does not change the original FWHM values of the features, however\nslightly (<\n\u223c 10%) reduces their depths. One immediately notices (Fig. 2, exposures 1-14 vs.\nexposures 40-59) the high-velocity, v \u2248 \u22121.5 \u2192 \u22121.0v\u221e feature seen in all well-developed\nP Cygni profiles across the spectrum. The excellent match between these features seen\nin both components of the S IV doublet lends additional credibility to the result. This\nabsorption component appears to be much wider in the CIII line, which can be explained\nby the multiplet nature of this transition, with contributing components being separated by\nas much as \u223c 0.1 v\u221e . While preparing Fig. 2, we tentatively assigned \u03bb0 = 1175.7\u00c5 to C\nIII, noticing that the components are spread between \u03bb\u03bb = 1174.93 \u2212 1176.37\u00c5. Another\nprominent feature at v \u2248 \u22120.8 \u2192 \u22120.2v\u221e is seriously affected by saturation (OVI, S IV and\nCIII profiles), which causes the displacements, or even near disappearance of this feature.\nHowever, this absorption component is clearly seen in the non-saturated Si III profile. From\nnow on we focus our attention on the feature less affected by saturation at v \u2248 \u22121.5 \u2192\n\u22121.0v\u221e , which, being above v\u221e , is practically free from the ambiguity introduced by the\nunderlying, forward-scattering emission component.\nWe notice the symmetric appearance of this blueshifted absorption in S IV, as expected\nfor a feature originating in an optically thin region with radially isotropic (backward/forward)\nturbulence. The asymmetry, the blueshift and the larger extension of the CIII ( and, to a\nlesser extent, O VI) feature can be related to the high optical depth (i.e., substantial selfabsorption) of the transition and saturation of the relevant part of the profile: compare S\n>\nIV or O VI to CIII at v\u223c\n\u2212 1.15v\u221e in Fig. 1.\nApparently, the velocity spacing of the OVI doublet places the variable (v < \u22121.2v\u221e )\npart of the absorption trough of the 1037.6\u00c5 component (Fig. 1) on the v < \u22120.1v\u221e emission\npart of the 1031.9\u00c5 line, which may complicate the interpretation, if one assumes that the\nobserved variability could be caused by changes in the underlying emission. For the OVI\n1037.6\u00c5 transition the detection of variability at v < \u22120.2v\u221e is impaired by the presence of\nstrong, saturated IS absorptions. However, we remedy with the CIII 1175.7\u00c5 complex. Its\nstrong, well-defined variability at v < \u22121.2v\u221e (Fig. 1) is not accompanied by any detectable\nchanges in the \u22120.4v\u221e < v < \u22120.1v\u221e part of the profile (Fig.2).\nThere are two possible explanations for the detected blue-edge (v > v\u221e ) variability:\ndiscrete absorption components (DACs) and fairly localized, wind-embedded shocks. The\nDACs are thought to be related to the co-rotating interaction regions (CIRs: Cranmer &\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nOwocki 1996), the zones where high-speed streams generated by disturbances at the base of\nthe wind collide with relatively slower parts of the wind. One should notice the high incidence\nof DACs in the winds of OB stars (Kaper et al. 1996) vs. relative rarity of these large-scale,\nspatially-coherent structures in the WR winds (see Marchenko 2003 and references therein).\nHave we captured a single, isolated, stochastically appearing shock or a CIR-like structure which periodically crosses the line of sight? We favor the former, as there is no trace\nof any large-scale, coherent structures in the optical (L\u00e9pine et al. 2000). Plus, the wind\nof WR135 is not flattened, contrary to all the CIR-bearing examples: WR6, WR134 and\nWR137 (see Lef\u00e8vre et al. 2005 and references therein). In OB stars any CIR-related variability takes place in a wide velocity range, \u2212v\u221e < v < v\u221e , practically never exceeding v\u221e\n(rather, slightly modulating the blueshifted absorption edge: Kaper & Henrichs 1994). In\nWR135 we see a clear dominance of variability which goes far beyond \u2212v\u221e , by as much\nas 50%. And, we see no signs of variability exceeding the 5-10% detectability levels in the\n'traditional' CIR domain, \u2212v\u221e < v < v\u221e (cf. the well-studied case of WR6: St-Louis et\nal. 1995). In WR135, rather than modulating the \u2212v\u221e < v edge, as usually attributable to\nCIRs, the short-living additional absorption is perceived as an isolated feature (cf. S IV 1073\nin Fig. 1) with no signs of a gradual shift to higher velocities (cf. CIII 1175.7 in Fig. 1). In\naddition, the timescales of the detected UV variability, \u223c 0.5 \u2212 1.0 d, correspond reasonably\nwell to the average 'survival' times of blobs in the optical region, <\n\u223c 0.5 d (L\u00e9pine et al. 2000).\nAnd, the FWHMs of the features seen in Fig. 2, F W HM \u2248 400 km s\u22121 \u2248 2.4\u03c3 (assuming\na Gaussian profile) closely match the observed value of the radial velocity dispersion in the\nblobs seen in optical emission lines, \u03c3 = 175 km s\u22121. The synchronized appearence of the absorption features in all major P Cygni profiles across the FUSE spectrum mimics the general\ncorrelation in the behavior of blobs observed in different lines in the optical (L\u00e9pine et al.\n2000, Lef\u00e8vre et al. 2005). Hence, one may relate the observed traces of shocked (and rapidly\ncooling, thus getting denser) gas to the incidence of numerous over-dense clumps (blobs) in\nthe wind of WR135. Of course, the great spatial coherence of a DAC-related structure may\nfacilitate detection. On the other hand, while adopting the model of a structured (clumpy)\nWR wind, one must count on the presence of a large amount of profile-forming, overdense\nstructures (e.g. Lepine et al. 2000). The sheer number of stochastically distributed inhomogeneities leads to high probability of seeing, at any given moment, such a structure in\nabsorption (i.e., projected on the optically thick part of the wind).\nOne may provide additional arguments favoring the 'shock' scenario over DAC (CIR)related variability. There are numerous examples of v > v\u221e variability in WR stars observed\nby IUE: WR 136 (St-Louis et al. 1989), WR 6 (St-Louis et al. 1995), to name a few. An\nextensive search for OVI variability in the winds of OB stars (Lehner et al. 2003) shows that\na solid majority, at least 64% of the O3-B1 targets, can be considered as variable. However,\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nnone of the surveyed objects showed v > v\u221e variations in O VI, despite the tendency of\nstronger shocks to occur more frequently near v\u221e , and despite the tendency of more than\n80% of O stars (Howarth & Prinja 1989) to show DACs in their spectra. Hence, the O VI\nline seems to be less sensitive to the DAC-related phenomena in comparison to other strong\nUV transitions. The only notable exception is \u03b1 Cam, where the detected variability in\nUV resonance lines (Lamers et al. 1988) extends far beyond the derived v\u221e = 1550 km s\u22121\n(Repolust et al. 2004).\nIf we are to interpret the variability as some kind of relaxation of the initially 'unperturbed' profile (red line in Fig. 1), then the OVI profile has the highest restoration pace. This\ncould be related to fast cooling of the shocked gas. Also, note that in the CIII and SIV profiles the higher-velocity (thus presumably higher-temperature) region is restored much faster.\n3\n\u22121\n7\nAdopting relative shock speeds of \u2206v = vshock \u2212 v\u221e <\n\u223c 10 km s , one obtains T \u223c 3 10 K\nfor the shocked gas (e.g. Stevens et al. 1992). Assuming that the cooling time is related\nto the disappearence of the extra-absorption features at v > v\u221e (Fig. 1), tcool \u223c 105 s, and\ntaking the cooling function for the WR wind (e.g. St-Louis et al. 2005), we estimate the\ndensity of the shocked gas as n \u223c 109 cm\u22123 . Hence, we observe shocks coming from the same\nregion populated by blobs: r = 6...82 R\u22c6 corresponds to n = 1010 ...108 cm\u22123 in the wind of\nWR135 (A. Barniske, priv. comm.). Indeed, taking the flow time t = R\u22c6 /v\u221e = 20 min (cf.\nKoesterke et al. 2001) and assuming that blobs originate at the base of the wind and survive\nfor <\n\u223c 10 h (on average, for 7.5h: L\u00e9pine et al. 2000), we find that the blobs observed in the\n<\noptical populate the region out to r\u223c\n30 R\u22c6, in fair agreement with the estimate coming from\nthe UV.\n\n4.\n\nConclusions\n\nFrom our simultaneous detection (both in time and velocity space) of a short-lived (hours)\nabsorption feature in the v > v\u221e parts of the emission profiles of lines with a wide range of\nionization potentials, including the shock-sensitive OVI doublet, we can conclude that:\n(a) in the winds of hot, massive stars the highly blueshifted, |v| > v\u221e , parts of the P\nCygni profiles may originate in high-speed, shocked regions of the winds;\n(b) considering the enormous, \u223c 1/4v\u221e , FWHM of the features (Fig. 2), one can safely\nassume that a network of shocks, each with an adequate azimuthal extension, may create\na flow with highly non-monotonic velocity field, thus resulting in a completely saturated P\nCygni trough - a hypothesis voiced a long time ago by Lucy (1983; with further developments\nin Puls et al. 1993), but never proved with any certainty;\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\n(c) the observed shocks may be responsible for the relatively soft X-ray flux from\nOB/WR winds, with relative (to an unperturbed flow) velocities of the shocked gas reaching\n<\n\u22121\n<\n\u223c 500 km s , thus providing kT\u223c 0.5keV , in good agreement with the characteristic X-ray\ntemperatures of single OB stars (Bergh\u00f6fer et al. 1996);\n(d) if shocks and blobs are related, then, considering the propagation of reverse/forward\nshocks (now the same as blobs) in the wind, we cannot expect them to follow the velocity\nlaw of an unperturbed wind. This may explain the seemingly low acceleration of blobs in\nthe WR winds (see the discussion in Koesterke et al. 2001).\nWe thank Stan Owocki for enlightening discussions of the wide range of issues related\nto wind instabilities.
