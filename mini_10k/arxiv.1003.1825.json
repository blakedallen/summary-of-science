The simplest case\nwith mass, spherical symmetry, despite its simplicity,\nstill remains an interesting problem in numerical relativity, specially when including dissipation. Dissipation\ndue to the emission of massless particles (photons and/or\nneutrinos) is a characteristic process in the evolution of\nmassive stars. It seems that the only plausible mechanism to carry away the bulk of the binding energy of the\ncollapsing star, leading to a black hole or neutron star,\nis neutrino emission [1]. Viscosity may be important in\nthe neutrino trapping during gravitational collapse [2\u20134],\nwhich is expected to occur when the central density is of\nthe order 1011 \u20131012 g cm\u22123 . Although the mean free path\nof the neutrinos is much greater than for others particles,\nthe radiative Reynolds number of the trapped neutrinos\nis nevertheless small at high density [5], rendering viscous\nthe core fluid [6], [1].\nNumerical Relativity is expected to keep its power to\nsolve problems and generate new, interesting physics,\nwhen dissipative distributions of matter are considered.\nIn fact, numerical methods in General Relativity have\nbeen proven to be extremely valuable for the investigation of strong field scenarios (see [7] and references\n\n\u2217 Also at: School of Physics, University of Melbourne, Parkville,\nVIC 3010, Australia\n\ntherein). For instance, these methods and frameworks\nhave (i) revealed unexpected phenomena [8], (ii) enabled\nthe simulation of binary black holes (neutron stars) [9, 10]\nand (iii) allowed the development of relativistic hydrodynamic solvers [11], among other achievements. Currently,\nthe main limitation for Numerical Relativity is the computational demand for 3D evolution [12]. The addition of\na test-bed for studying dissipation mechanisms and other\ntransport processes in order to later incorporate them\ninto a more sophisticated numerical framework (ADM or\ncharacteristic) is a necessity.\nIn this paper, we study a selfgravitating spherical distribution of matter containing a dissipative fluid. We\nfollow the method proposed in [13], which introduces a\nset of conveniently defined \"effective\" variables (effective\npressure and energy density), where their radial dependence is chosen on heuristic grounds. In essence this is\nequivalent to going one step further from the quasistatic\nregime, and the method has been named the postquasistatic approximation (PQSA) after [14]. The essence\nof the PQSA was first proposed in [15] using radiative\nBondi coordinates and it has been extensively used by\nHerrera and collaborators [16\u201323]. By quasistatic approximation we mean that the effective variables coincide with the corresponding physical variables (pressure\nand energy density). However, in Bondi coordinates the\nnotion of quasistatic approximation is not evident: the\nsystem goes directly from static to postquasistatic evolution. In an adiabatic and slow evolution we can catch\u2013up\nthat phase, clearly seen in non\u2013comoving coordinates.\nThis can be achieved using Schwarzschild coordinates\n[14]. Here we study radiating viscous fluid spheres in\n\n\f2\nthe streaming out limit with the PQSA approach which\nallow us to departure from equilibrium in non\u2013comoving\ncoordinates. These systems have been studied using the\nmethod described in [15] for the radiative shear viscosity problem and its effect on the relativistic gravitational\ncollapse [24\u201328]. We do not consider temperature profiles to determine which processes can take place during\nthe collapse. For that purpose, transport equations in\nthe relaxation time approximation have been proposed\nto avoid pathological behaviors (see for instance [22] and\nreferences therein). These issues will be considered in\na future investigation. In order to develop a numerical\nsolver which incorporates in a realistic way dissipation\nfollowing the M\u00fcller-Israel-Stewart theory [29\u201332] it is\nfirst necessary to know, to zeroth level of approximation,\nviscosity profiles like the ones presented in this investigation. The physical consequences of considering dissipation by means of an appropriate causal procedure have\nbeen stated analytically in several papers by Herrera and\ncollaborators (see for example [33\u201336]).\nTo the best of our knowledge, no author has undertaken in practice the dissipative matter problem in numerical relativity. Our purpose here is to show how viscosity processes can be considered as anisotropy and how\nthe PQSA works in this context. Our results partially\nconfirm previous investigations [25, 26]. The novelty here\nis in the use of the PQSA to study dissipative scenarios.\nThe results indicate that an observer using radiation coordinates does not \"see\" some details when shear viscosity is considered. The final goal is to eventually study the\nsame problem using the M\u00fcller-Israel-Stewart theory for\ndissipative system, which is highly nontrivial in spherical\nsymmetry.\nIn standard numerical relativity, in order to deal with\nmatter both in ADM 3+1 [37] and in the characteristic\nformulations [11], Bondian observers have been used implicitly. This has been noted recently, and the method\nhas been proposed as a test bed in numerical relativity\n[38]. The systematic use of local Minkowskian and comoving observers in the PQSA, named Bondians, was\nused to reveal a central equation of state in adiabatic\nscenarios [39], and to couple matter with radiation [40].\nSince Bondian observers are a fundamental part of the\nPQSA and all its applications in the characteristic formulation we are currently trying to transfer all the experience gained using this approach to include more realistic effects in the dynamics of the fluid using the ADM\n3+1 formulation, the most popular method in numerical\nrelativity. Besides introducing a more realistic time scale\nin the problem with matter the intention is to promote\nthe PQSA (and any of its applications) as a test bed in\nthe ADM 3+1 and characteristic approaches.\nThe plan for this paper is as follows: In Section \u00a7II\nwe present the field equations and matching conditions\nat the surface of the distribution. We explain the PQSA\nand write a set of surface equations, in Section \u00a7III. In\nSection \u00a7IV we illustrate the method presenting four simple models based on the Schwarzschild and Tolman VI in-\n\nterior solutions. Finally, we discuss the results in Section\n\u00a7V.\nII.\n\nFIELD EQUATIONS FOR BONDIAN\nFRAMES AND MATCHING\n\nTo write the Einstein field equations we use the line\nelement in Schwarzschild\u2013like coordinates\n\u0001\nds2 = e\u03bd dt2 \u2212 e\u03bb dr2 \u2212 r2 d\u03b82 + sin 2 \u03b8d\u03c62 ,\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03bd = \u03bd(t, r) and \u03bb = \u03bb(t, r), with (t, r, \u03b8, \u03c6) \u2261\n(0, 1, 2, 3).\nIn order to get physical input we introduce the\nMinkowski coordinates (\u03c4, x, y, z) by [41]\nd\u03c4 = e\u03bd/2 dt, dx = e\u03bb/2 dr, dy = rd\u03b8, dz = r sin \u03b8d\u03c6, (2)\nIn these expressions \u03bd and \u03bb are constants, because they\nhave only local values.\nNext we assume that, for an observer moving relative\nto these coordinates with velocity \u03c9 in the radial (x)\ndirection, the space contains\n\u2022 a viscous fluid of density \u03c1, pressure p\u0302, effective bulk\npressure p\u03b6 and effective shear pressure p\u03b7 , and\n\u2022 unpolarized radiation of energy density \u01eb\u0302.\nFor this moving observer, the covariant energy tensor\nin Minkowski coordinates is thus\n\uf8f6\n\u03c1 + \u01eb\u0302\n\u2212\u01eb\u0302\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec \u2212\u01eb\u0302 p\u0302 + \u01eb\u0302 \u2212 p\u03b6 \u2212 2p\u03b7\n\uf8f8.\n\uf8ed 0\n0\np\u0302 \u2212 p\u03b6 + p\u03b7\n0\n0\n0\n0\np\u0302 \u2212 p\u03b6 + p\u03b7\n(3)\nNote that from (2) the velocity of matter in\nSchwarzschild coordinates is\n\uf8eb\n\ndr\n= \u03c9e(\u03bd\u2212\u03bb)/2 .\ndt\n\n(4)\n\nMaking a Lorentz boost and defining p\u0304 \u2261 p\u0302 \u2212 p\u03b6 , pr \u2261\np\u0304 \u2212 2p\u03b7 , pt \u2261 p\u0304 + p\u03b7 and \u01eb \u2261 \u01eb\u0302(1 + \u03c9)/(1 \u2212 \u03c9) we write\nthe field equations in relativistic units (G = c = 1) as\nfollows:\n\u0014\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0012\n1 1\n1\n\u03c1\u0303 =\n,\n(5)\n\u2212 e\u2212\u03bb\n\u2212 \u03bb,r\n8\u03c0r r\nr\n\u0012\n\u0014\n\u0013\n\u0015\n1\n1\n1\n\u2212\u03bb\np\u0303 =\ne\n,\n+ \u03bd,r \u2212\n8\u03c0r\nr\nr\npt =\n\n(6)\n\n2\n1\n2\n{e\u2212\u03bb [2\u03bd,rr + \u03bd,r\n\u2212 \u03bb,r \u03bd,r + (\u03bd,r \u2212 \u03bb,r )]\n32\u03c0\nr\n\u2212 e\u2212\u03bd [2\u03bb,tt + \u03bb,t (\u03bb,t \u2212 \u03bd,t )]},\n\n(7)\n\n\f3\n\nS=\u2212\n\n\u03bb,t \u2212 1 (\u03bd+\u03bb)\n,\ne 2\n8\u03c0r\n\n(8)\n\nwhere the comma (,) represents partial differentiation\nwith respect to the indicated coordinate and the effective variables \u03c1\u0303, S, known as conservation variables as\nwell, and p\u0303, the flux variable,\n\u03c1\u0303 =\n\n\u03c1 + pr \u03c9 2\n+ \u01eb,\n1 \u2212 \u03c92\n\n(9)\n\n\u03c9\nS = (\u03c1 + pr )\n+\u01eb\n1 \u2212 \u03c92\npr + \u03c1\u03c9 2\n+ \u01eb.\n1 \u2212 \u03c92\n\n(11)\n\np\u03b6 = \u03b6\u0398,\n\n(12)\n\n2\np\u03b7 = \u221a \u03b7\u03c3,\n3\n\n(13)\n\nwhere\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0014\n1\n\u03c9\u03c9,t\n\u03bb,t\n\u2212\u03bd/2\n+\ne\n2\n1 \u2212 \u03c92\n(1 \u2212 \u03c9 2 )1/2\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\n\u03bd,r\n2\u03c9\n1 + \u03c92\n\u2212\u03bb/2\n+e\n\u03c9,r +\n\u03c9+\n2\n1 \u2212 \u03c92\nr\n\u0012\n\n\u0398 e\u2212\u03bb/2\n\u03c9\n\u221a\n\u2212\n3\nr\n1 \u2212 \u03c92\n\n2M\nRa\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n\u03bda = \u2212\u03bba .\n\n(18)\n\n(14)\n\n(15)\n\nWe have four field equations for five physical variables\n(\u03c1, pr , \u01eb, \u03c9 and pt ) and two geometrical variables (\u03bd and\n\u03bb).

In this case we integrate the\nsystem for the initial conditions A(0) = 5, M (0) = 1 and\n\u03a9 = \u22120.01. Figure 10 shows the radius of the distribution for different values of h. Figures 11\u201312 display the\nradial velocity and the shear viscosity for h = 0.9. In\nthis case anisotropy manifests clearly at the surface. As\nlong as pt is greater than pr the collapse accelerates.

We obtain similar results as in model II but in a different fashion. The bigger the\n\n\f10\ndifference between the tangential (viscous) pressure pt and the radial pressure pr (as h decreases), the more violently\nthe distribution explodes. It is striking that now all the spherical shells tend to reach the same instantaneous local\nradial velocity when the system goes to faster collapse with emission of energy across de boundary surface. At least\nlocally, the \"acceleration\" of all the shells goes to zero at the same time; again the same instantaneous local radial\nvelocity (negative) is reached before a final bouncing per shell from outer to inner.\nD.\n\nTolman VI\u2013like model IV: adiabatic\n\nWe construct this model with the same effective variables and metric functions as in model III, but now the radiation\nflux is zero everyhere; therefore this model is adiabatic. Obviously we do not need now an equation of state because\nall physical variables are determined algebraically from the field equations. However some measure of tangential stress\nat the surface is required to evolve the system. We opt for a tangential pressure equal to the radial pressure just at\nthe surface, pt |a = pr |a , as in model II.

The use of the\nPQSA with non\u2013comoving coordinates allow us to study\nviscous fluid spheres in the streaming out limit as they\njust depart from equilibrium. From this point of view,\nthe PQSA can also be seen as a nonlinear perturbative\nmethod to test the stability of solutions in equilibrium.\nFor the non\u2013adiabatic Schwarzschild model the distribution evolves to a final state with a non\u2013viscous and\n\n8.4\n\nh=0.7\nh=1.0\nh=1.3\n\n8.3\n8.2\n8.1\nRadii\n\nIntegrating the system for the initial conditions A(0) = 8\nand \u03a9 = \u22120.1, figure 13 shows the radius of the distribution for different values of h. Figures 16\u201318 display\nthe radial velocity and the shear viscosity for h = 0.9.\nAfter some numerical experimentation some non\u2013trivial\nresults arise, and we relax the condition pt > pr . At the\nsurface we do not find any novelty. The most violent explosion occurs as pr >> pt . In this adiabatic but viscous\n(anisotropic) model all the shells bounce at the same time\nto irrupt from inner regions to outer regions with an apparently linear dependence with time. The outer shells\nof matter are ejected faster and earlier than the inner\nones. This sort of behavior was reported several years\nago studying in Bondi coordinates the collapse of radiating distributions with an extreme transport mechanism\nas diffusion [46]. However, the shear viscosity profiles indicate that i) bouncing is not allowed at all and ii) some\ninner regions are forbidden, otherwise the shear viscosity profiles become negative or/and infinite (see Figure\n18). This situation is general and independent of the\nanisotropy parameter h.\n\n(49)\n\n8\n7.9\n7.8\n7.7\n7.6\n7.5\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\nTime\n\nFIG. 16: Evolution of the radii for the Tolman VI-like model\nIV.

Surprisingly, in this model the\nevolution of the local radial velocity at the surface is\nthe same in the isotropic (pt = pr ) case, a fortuitous\ncoincidence due to the chosen equation and state and\nthe incompressibility of the fluid. For the adiabatic\nSchwarzschild model the final core is up to 105 times\nmore viscous, and the anisotropy appears explicitly in all\nthe evolution equations. The higher viscosity of the core\nincreases the effective gravity and the collapse is faster,\nas long as pt > pr .\nBoth of the Tolman VI models lead to a distribu-\n\n\f11\n0.08\n0.06\nLocal radial velocity\n\ntion which initially collapses and then bounces and\nexpands indefinitely. The Tolman VI non\u2013adiabatic\nmodel shares some of the characteristics of the adiabatic\nSchwarzschild. Before the final bouncing, as pt > pr the\ncollapse is accelerated. For the non\u2013adiabatic case some\nregions of the parameter space are forbidden, since the\nshear viscosity profiles become unphysical. In this case\nthe bouncing is not allowed and the distribution collapses\nindefinitely.\n\nr/a=0.2\nr/a=0.4\nr/a=0.6\nr/a=0.8\nr/a=1.0\n\n0.04\n0.02\n0\n-0.02\n-0.04\n-0.06\n-0.08\n-0.1\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\nTime\n\nFIG. 17: Evolution of the local radial velocity \u03c9 for the Tolman VI-like model IV.

Also, a work in progress considers heat flow and\nanisotropy induced by electric charge, pointing to the\nmost realistic numeric modeling in this area [47]. Although they are not entirely new, the results presented\nhere constitute a first cut to more general situations using the PQSA, including dissipation, anisotropy, electric\ncharge, heat flow, viscosity, radiation flux, superficial tension, temperature profiles and study their influence on\nthe gravitational collapse. This investigation is an essential part of a long-term project which tries to incorporate\nthe M\u00fcller\u2013Israel\u2013Stewart theory for dissipation and deviations from spherical symmetry, specially when considering electrically charged distributions. Besides being\ninteresting in their own right, we believe that spherically\nsymmetric fluid models are useful as a test bed for more\ngeneral solvers in numerical relativity [39, 40].
