For every natural number m, the existentially closed models of\nthe theory of fields with m commuting derivations can be given a first-order\ngeometric characterization in several ways. In particular, the theory of these\ndifferential fields has a model-companion. The axioms are that certain differential varieties determined by certain ordinary varieties are nonempty. There\nis no restriction on the characteristic of the underlying field.\n\nHow can we tell whether a given system of partial differential equations has a\nsolution? An answer given in this paper is that, if we differentiate the equations\nenough times, and no contradiction arises, then it never will, and the system is\nsoluble. Here, the meaning of 'enough times' can be expressed uniformly; this is\none way of showing that the theory of fields with a given finite number of commuting\nderivations has a model-companion. In fact, this theorem is worked out here (as\nCorollary 4.6, of Theorem 4.5), not in terms of polynomials, but in terms of the\nvarieties that they define, and the function-fields of these: in a word, the treatment\nis geometric.\nThe theory of fields with m commuting derivations will be called here m-DF; its\nmodel-companion, m-DCF. A specified characteristic can be indicated by a subscript. The model-companion of m-DF0 (in characteristic 0) has been axiomatized\nbefore, explicitly in terms of differential polynomials: see \u00a73. The existence of a\nmodel-companion of m-DF (with no specified characteristic) appears to be a new\nresult when m > 1 (despite a remark by Saharon Shelah [24, p. 315]: 'I am quite\nsure that for characteristic p as well, [making m greater than 1] does not make any\nessential difference').\nThe theory of model-companions and model-completions was worked out decades\nago; perhaps for that very reason, it may be worthwhile to review the theory here,\nas I do in \u00a71. In \u00a72, I review the various known characterizations of existentially\nclosed fields with single derivations. In fact, little of this work is of use in the\npassage to several derivations; but this near-irrelevance is itself interesting. In \u00a73, I\nanalyze the error of my earlier attempt, in [13], to axiomatize m-DCF0 in terms of\ndifferential forms. Something of value from this earlier work does remain: when we\ndo have m-DCF0 , or more generally m-DCF, then we can obtain from it a modelcompanion of the theory of fields with m derivations whose linear span over the\nfield is closed under the Lie bracket. In \u00a74, I obtain m-DCF itself.\n\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. 03C10 (03C60, 12H05).\nVersion of November 6, 2018.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nDAVID PIERCE\n\n1. Model-theoretic background\nI try in this section to give original references, when I have been able to consult\nthem. An exposition can also be found for example in Hodges [6] (particularly\nchapter 8).\nLet \u0393 be a set of (first-order) sentences in some signature; the structures that\nhave this signature and are models of \u0393 compose the class denoted by Mod(\u0393). Every class K of structures of some signature has a theory, denoted by Th(K); this\nis the set of sentences in the signature that are true in each of the structures in K.\nImmediately K \u2286 Mod(Th(K)); in case of equality, K is called elementary. Similarly, \u0393 \u2286 Th(Mod(\u0393)); in case of equality, that is, in case \u0393 is actually the theory\nof Mod(\u0393), then \u0393 is called a theory, simply. So there is a Galois correspondence\nbetween elementary classes and theories.\nLet M be an arbitrary (first-order) structure; the theory of {M} is denoted by\nTh(M). The structure M has the universe M . The structure denoted by MM is\nthe expansion of M that has a name for every element of M . Then M embeds in N\nif and only if MM embeds in an expansion of N. The class of structures in which M\nembeds need not be elementary: for example, M could be an uncountable model\nof a countable theory. However, the class of structures in which MM embeds is\nelementary. The theory of the latter class is the diagram of M, or diag(M): it is\naxiomatized by the quantifier-free sentences in Th(MM ) [18, Thm 2.1.3, p. 24]. A\nmodel of Th(MM ) itself is just a structure in which MM embeds elementarily.\nThus the class of such structures is elementary. The class of substructures of models\nof a theory T is elementary, and its theory is denoted by T\u2200 : this is axiomatized by\nthe universal sentences of T [18, Thm 3.3.2, p. 71].\nBy a system over M, I mean a finite conjunction of atomic and negated atomic\nformulas in the signature of MM ; likewise, a system over a theory T is in the\nsignature of T . A structure M solves a system \u03c6(x) if M |= \u2203x \u03c6(x). Note\nwell here that x, in boldface, is a tuple of variables, perhaps (x0 , . . . , xn\u22121 ). By\nan extension of a model of T , I mean another model of T of which the first is a\nsubstructure. Two systems over a model M of T will be called equivalent if they\nare soluble in precisely the same extensions.\nAn existentially closed model of T is a model of T that solves every system\nover itself that is soluble in some extension. So a model M of T is existentially\nclosed if and only if T \u222a diag(M) \u22a2 Th(MM )\u2200 , that is, every extension of M is a\nsubstructure of an elementary extension ([5, \u00a77] or [25, \u00a72]).\nA theory is model-complete if its every model is existentially closed. An\nequivalent formulation explains the name: T is model-complete if and only if T \u222a\ndiag(M) is complete whenever M |= T [19, Ch. 2].\nSuppose every model of T has an existentially closed extension. Such is the\ncase when T is inductive, that is, Mod(T ) is closed under unions of chains [5,\nThm 7.12]: equivalently, T = T\u2200\u2203 [9, 3]. Suppose further that we have a uniform\nfirst-order way to tell when systems over models of T are soluble in extensions:\nmore precisely, suppose there is a function\n\u03c6(x, y) 7\u2212\u2192 \u03c6(x,\nb y),\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03c6(x, y) ranges over the systems over T (with variables analyzed as shown),\nsuch that, for every model M of T and every tuple a of parameters from M , the\nsystem \u03c6(x, a) is soluble in some extension of M just in case \u03c6(x,\nb a) is soluble in\n\n\fFIELDS WITH SEVERAL COMMUTING DERIVATIONS\n\n3\n\nM. Then the existentially closed models of T compose an elementary class, whose\ntheory T \u2217 is axiomatized by T together with the sentences\n\u2200y (\u2203x \u03c6(x,\nb y) \u21d2 \u2203x \u03c6(x, y)).\n\n(2)\n\nImmediately, T \u2217 is model-complete, so T \u2217 \u222a diag(M) is complete when M |= T \u2217 .\nWhat is more, T \u2217 \u222a diag(M) is complete whenever M |= T [18, Thm 5.5.1].\nIn general, T \u2217 is a model-completion of T if T \u2217 \u2200 \u2286 T \u2286 T \u2217 and T \u2217 \u222a diag(M)\nis complete whenever M |= T . Model-completions are unique [17, (2.8)]. We have\nsketched the proof of part of the following; the rest is [17, (3.5)].\nLemma 1.1 (Robinson's Criterion). Let T be inductive. Then T has a modelcompletion if and only if a function \u03c6(x, y) 7\u2192 \u03c6(x,\nb y) exists as in (1). In this\ncase, the model-completion is axiomatized modulo T by the sentences in (2).\nIf T\u2200 = T \u2217 \u2200 and T \u2217 is model-complete, then T \u2217 is a model-companion of T ([1,\n\u00a75]; cf. [5, \u00a72]). Model-completions are model-companions, and model-companions\nare unique [1, Thm 5.3]. If T has a model-companion, then its models are just the\nexistentially closed models of T [5, Prop. 7.10]. Conversely, if T is inductive, and\nthe class of existentially closed models of T is elementary, then the theory of this\nclass is the model-companion of T [5, Cor. 7.13].\n2. Fields with one derivation\nLet DF be the theory of fields with a derivation D, and let DPF be the theory\nof models of DF that, for each prime l, satisfy also\n\u2200x \u2203y (l = 0 & Dx = 0 \u21d2 y l = x),\nwhere the first occurrence of l stands for 1 + * * *+ 1 (with l occurrences of 1); and y l\nstands for y * * * y (with l occurrences of y). Models of DPF are called differentially\nperfect. A subscript on the name of one of these theories will indicate a required\ncharacteristic for the field. In particular, we have DPF0 , which is the same as DF0 .\nAbraham Seidenberg [23] shows the existence of the function in Lemma 1.1 in\ncase T is DPFp , where p is prime or 0. Consequently:\nTheorem 2.1 (Robinson). DF0 has a model-completion, called DCF0 .\nTheorem 2.2 (Wood [30]). If p is prime, then DFp has a model-companion, called\nDCFp , which is the model-completion of DPFp .\nThe existence of a model-companion or model-completion of a theory does not\nnecessarily tell us much about the existentially closed models of the theory. Since\nit involves all systems over a given theory, Robinson's criterion yields the crudest\npossible axiomatization for a model-completion. In the case of DCFp (again where\np is prime or 0), there are two ways of refining the axiomatization-refining in\nthe sense of finding seemingly weaker conditions on models of DFp that are still\nsufficient for being existentially closed. It suffices to consider either systems in\nonly one variable or systems involving only first derivatives. In the generalization\nto several derivations, the former refinement seems to be of little use; the latter\nrefinement is of use indirectly, through its introduction of geometric ideas.\n\n\f4\n\nDAVID PIERCE\n\n2.1. Single variables. Though the theory ACF of algebraically closed fields is the\nmodel-completion of the theory of fields, its axioms (modulo the latter theory) can\ninvolve only systems in one variable (indeed, single equations in one variable). A\ngeneralization of this observation is the following, which can be extracted from the\nproof of [21, Thm 17.2, pp. 89\u201391] (see also [2]):\nLemma 2.3 (Blum's Criterion). Say T \u2217 \u2200 \u2286 T \u2286 T \u2217 .\n(i) The theory T \u2217 is the model-completion of T if and only if the commutative\ndiagram\nM\nO `\n/B\nA\nof structures and embeddings can be completed as indicated when A and B\nare models of T and M is a |B|+ -saturated model of T \u2217 .\n(ii) If T = T\u2200 , it is enough to assume that B is generated over A by a single\nelement.\nThis allows a refinement of Lemma 1.1 in a special case:\nLemma 2.4. Suppose T = T\u2200 . Then Lemma 1.1 still holds when \u03c6(x, y) is replaced\nwith \u03c6(x, y) (where x is a single variable).\nFrom Lemma 2.3, Lenore Blum obtains Theorem 2.5 below in characteristic 0, in\nwhich case the first two numbered conditions amount to K |= ACF ([21, pp. 298 ff.]\nor [2]). If p > 0, then DPFp is not universal, so part (ii) of Blum's criterion does\nnot apply; Carol Wood instead uses a primitive-element theorem of Seidenberg [22]\nto obtain new axioms for DCFp [31]. These can be combined with Blum's axioms\nfor DCF0 to yield the following. (Here SCF is the theory of separably closed fields.)\nTheorem 2.5 (Blum, Wood). A model (K, D) of DF is existentially closed if and\nonly if\n(i) K |= SCF;\n(ii) (K, D) |= DPF;\n(iii) (K, D) |= \u2203x (f (x, Dx, . . . , Dn+1 x) = 0 & g(x, Dx, . . . , Dn x) 6= 0) whenever f and g are ordinary polynomials over K in tuples (x0 , . . . , xn+1 ) and\n(x0 , . . . , xn ) of variables respectively such that g 6= 0 and \u2202f /\u2202xn+1 6= 0.\nHence DF has a model-companion, called DCF.\nThere is a similar characterization of the existentially closed ordered differential\nfields [26].\n2.2. First derivatives. Alternative simplified axioms for DCF are parallel to those\nfound for the model-companion ACFA of the theory of fields with an automorphism\n[10, 4]. Suppose (K, D) |= DPF and K |= SCF. Given a system over (K, D), we\ncan rewrite it so that D is applied only to variables or derivatives of variables; then\nwe can replace each derivative with a new variable, obtaining a system\n^\nf = 0 & g 6= 0 & Dx = y,\n(3)\nf\n\nV\ni\ni\nwhere f, g \u2208 K[x, y] and Dx = y stands for i Dx\nV = y . We can also incorporate\nthis condition into the rest of the system, writing f f (x, Dx) = 0 & g(x, Dx) 6= 0.\n\n\fFIELDS WITH SEVERAL COMMUTING DERIVATIONS\n\n5\n\nSuppose (3) has the solution (a, b). Then K(a, b)/K is separable [14, Lem. 1.5,\np. 1328]. Let V and W be the varieties over K with generic points a and (a, b)\nrespectively, let TD (V ) be the twisted tangent bundle of V , and let U be the open\nsubset of W defined by the inequation g 6= 0. In characteristic 0, the model (K, D)\nof DF is existentially closed if and only if, in every such geometric situation, U\ncontains a K-rational point (c, Dc); this yields the so-called geometric axioms for\nDCF0 found with Anand Pillay [15]. In positive characteristic, it is still true that,\nif (a, b) is a generic point of V , then D extends to K(a) so that Da = b. However,\nan additional condition is needed to ensure that D extends to all of K(a, b); it is\nenough to require that the projection of TD (W ) onto TD (V ) contain a generic point\nof W ; this yields Piotr Kowalski's geometric axioms for DCFp [8].\nBy the trick of replacing g 6= 0 with z * g = 1, we may assume that there is\nno inequation in (3). In an alternative geometric approach to DCF, we can then\nconsider (3) as a special case of\n^\n^\nf =0&\nDxi = g i ,\n(4)\nf\n\ni<k\n\nwhere f \u2208 K[x0 , . . . , xn\u22121 ] and g i \u2208 K(x0 , . . . , xn\u22121 ). Suppose this has solution a,\nthat is, (a0 , . . . , an\u22121 ), which is a generic point of a variety V . Then we know that\nD extends so as to map K(a) into some field. We know too that this extension of D\nmaps the subfield K(a0 , . . . , ak\u22121 ) of K(a) into K(a) itself; indeed, this extension\nis given by the equations Dai = g i (a). Now we can extend D further to all of\nK(a) so that this becomes a differential field [14, Lem. 1.2 (3), p. 1326]. Going\nback and picking a new generating tuple for K(a) as needed, we may assume that\n(a0 , . . . , ak\u22121 ) is a separating transcendence-basis of K(a)/K. Then we have a\ndominant, separable rational map x 7\u2192 (x0 , . . . , xk\u22121 ) or \u03c6 from V onto Ak , and\nanother rational map x 7\u2192 (g 0 (x), . . . , g k\u22121 (x)) or \u03c8 from V to Ak . So (K, D)\nis existentially closed if and only if V always has a K-rational point P such that\nD(\u03c6(P )) = \u03c8(P ) [14, Thm 1.6, p. 1328].\n3. Fields with several derivations\nLet m-DF be the theory of fields with m commuting derivations. Tracey McGrail\n[12] axiomatizes the model-completion, m-DCF0 , of m-DF0 . Alternative axiomatizations arise as special cases in work of Yoav Yaffe [32] and Marcus Tressl [28].\nThere is a common theme: A differential ideal has a generating set of a special\nform; in the terminology of Joseph Ritt [16, \u00a7I.5, p. 5] (when m = 1) and Ellis\nKolchin [7, \u00a7I.10, pp. 81 ff.], this is a characteristic set. There is a first-order way\nto tell, uniformly in the parameters, whether a given set of differential polynomials\nis a characteristic set of some differential ideal, and then to tell, if it is a characteristic set, whether it has a root. In short, the function \u03c6 7\u2192 \u03c6\nb in Robinson's\ncriterion (Lemma 1.1) is defined for sufficiently many systems \u03c6. (Applying Blum's\ncriterion, McGrail and Yaffe consider only systems in one variable, so they must\ninclude inequations in these systems; Tressl uses only equations, in arbitrarily many\nvariables.)\nI do not give the definition of a characteristic set, as not all ingredients of the\ndefinition are needed for the arguments presented in \u00a74. However, some of the\ningredients are needed; these are in 4.1.\n\n\f6\n\nDAVID PIERCE\n\n3.1. Spaces of derivations. In [13] I attempted to apply the geometric approach\nm\ndescribed in 2.2 to m-DF0 . I worked more generally with DFm\nis\n0 , where DF\nthe theory of structures (K, D0 , . . . , Dm\u22121 ) such that (K, Di ) |= DF for each i,\nand each bracket [Dj , Dk ] is a K-linear combination of the Di . (This is roughly\nwhat Yaffe did too.) In [14, \u00a72] I made some minor corrections and otherwise\nadapted the argument to arbitrary characteristic. Nonetheless, in May, 2006, Ehud\nHrushovski showed me a counterexample to [13, Thm A, p. 926], a theorem that\nwas an introductory formulation of [13, Thm 5.7, p. 942]. Then I found an error\nat the end of the proof of the latter theorem. That theorem is simply wrong; the\npresent paper does not so much correct the theorem as replace it.\nThe developments leading up to the wrong theorem are still of some use. The\ngeneral situation is as follows. Let (K, D0 , . . . , Dm\u22121 ) |= DFm , and let E be the\nK-linear span of the Di . Then E is a Lie-ring, as well as a vector-space over K. As\na vector-space, E has a dual, E \u2217 ; and there is a derivation d from K into E \u2217 given\nby D(d x) = Dx. Then E \u2217 has a basis (d ti : i < l) for some ti in K and some l no\ngreater than m [13, Lem. 4.4, p. 932], and this basis is dual to a basis (\u2202i : i < l)\nof E, where [\u2202i , \u2202j ] = 0 in each case, and d can be given by\nX\ndx =\nd ti * \u2202i x\n(5)\ni<l\n\n[13, Lem. 4.7, p. 934]. We can use these ideas to prove the following.\nTheorem 3.1. If m-DF has a model-companion, then so does DFm .\nProof. In characteristic 0, the result is implicit in [13, Thm 5.3 and proof], explicit\nin [27, \u00a73]; but the proof works generally. The main point is to find, for any\nmodel (K, D0 , . . . , Dm\u22121 ) of DFm , an extension in which the named derivations\nare linearly independent over the larger field. As above, the space spanned over K\nby the Di has a basis (\u2202i : i < l) of commuting derivations of K. If l < m, then\nlet L = K(\u03b1l , . . . , \u03b1m\u22121 ), where (\u03b1l , . . . , \u03b1m\u22121 ) is algebraically independent over\nK. Extend the \u2202i to L so that they are 0 at the \u03b1j ; then, if l 6 k < m, define\n\u2202k to be 0 on K and to be \u03b4jk at \u03b1j . Then (\u2202i : i < m) is a linearly independent\nm-tuple of commuting derivations on L; from this, we obtain linearly independent\nextensions D\u0303i of the Di to L such that the brackets [D\u0303j , D\u0303k ] are the same linear\ncombinations of the D\u0303i that the [Dj , Dk ] are of the Di (by [13, Lem. 5.2, p. 937]-\nor [27, Lem. 2.1, p. 1930], by a different method-in characteristic 0; generally,\n[14, Lem. 2.4, p. 1334]). Then (K, Di , . . . , Dm\u22121 ) \u2286 (L, D\u03030 , . . . , D\u0303m\u22121 ), and the\nlatter is a model of DFm . Moreover, (L, D\u03030 , . . . , D\u0303m\u22121 ) is an existentially closed\nmodel if and only if (L, \u22020 , . . . , \u2202m\u22121 ) is an existentially closed model of DFm ; so a\nmodel-companion of DFm can be derived from a model-companion of m-DF.\n\u0003\nThat much stands, and differential forms are convenient for establishing it. The\ntheorem, combined with the results of \u00a74, will yield a model-companion, DCFm , of\nDFm .\n3.2. A new approach. In [13] I tried also to obtain DCFm\n0 independently as\nfollows. Suppose now we have a separably closed field K, along with a Lie-ring and\nfinite-dimensional space E of derivations of K; as a space, E has (for some m) a\nbasis (\u2202i : i < m), whose dual is (d ti : i < m), so that the \u2202i commute. We may\n\n\fFIELDS WITH SEVERAL COMMUTING DERIVATIONS\n\n7\n\nassume that (K, \u22020 , . . . , \u2202m\u22121 ) is differentially perfect [14, Lem. 2.4]. Every system\nover (K, \u22020 , . . . , \u2202m\u22121 ) is equivalent to a system of the form of (4), generalized to\n^\n^ ^\n\u2202i xj = gij .\n(6)\nf =0&\nj<k i<m\n\nf\n\nHere again f \u2208 K[x0 , . . . , xn\u22121 ], and gij \u2208 K(x0 , . . . , xn\u22121 ). By means of (5), we\ncan also write the system as\n^\n^\nX\nd ti * gij .\n(7)\nf =0&\nd xj =\nf\n\nj<k\n\ni<m\n\nIf (a0 , . . . , an\u22121 ) or a is a solution (from some extension), we may assume that\n(a0 , . . . , ak\u22121 ) is a separating transcendence-basis of K(a0 , . . . , ak\u22121 )/K. However,\nwe can no longer assume that (a0 , . . . , ak\u22121 ) is a separating transcendence-basis of\nK(a)/K itself. In characteristic 0, this is shown by the example referred to in [13,\nExple 1.2, p. 927]; we can adapt the example to positive characteristic p by letting\nK = Fp (b\u03c3 : \u03c3 \u2208 \u03c92 ) and defining \u22020 b(i,j) = b(i+1,j) and \u22021 b(i,j) = b(i,j+1) . Let\n(a1 , a2 ) be algebraically independent over K, but a0 = (a2 )p , and define \u22020 a0 =\n0 = \u22021 a0 and \u22020 a1 = b(0,0) and \u22021 a1 = a2 . Then the \u2202i are commuting derivations\nmapping K(a0 , a1 ) into K(a0 , a1 , a2 ), and they extend as commuting derivations\nto the latter field, but not so as to map this field into itself. This is an important\ndifference from the case of one derivation; it is what causes the difficulties in the\ncase of several derivations.\nIn our example, K(a0 , a1 , a2 )/K(a0 , a1 ) is not separable. However, if we let a3\nbe a new transcendental and define \u22020 a2 = b(0,1) and \u22021 a2 = a3 , then the \u2202i are still\ncommuting derivations, now mapping K(a0 , a1 , a2 ) into K(a0 , a1 , a2 , a3 ), and the\nlarger field is indeed separable over the subfield. This will turn out to be possible\nin general. That is, in (7), we shall be able to assume that (a0 , . . . , ak\u22121 ) is a\nseparating transcendence-basis of K(a0 , . . . , ak\u22121 )/K and it extends to a separating\ntranscendence-basis (a0 , . . . , al\u22121 ) of K(a)/K. This is obvious in characteristic 0.\nThe solution a to (7) then can be understood as follows. First we have the field\nK(a), and then (7) can be be written as\n^\nX\nd ti * gij (a).\n(8)\nd aj =\nj<k\n\ni<m\n\nA solution of this can be understood as a model (L, \u2202 \u03030 , . . . , \u2202 \u0303m\u22121 ) of m-DF extending (K, \u22020 , . . . , \u2202m\u22121 ) such that K(a) \u2286 L and also (8) holds when d aj =\nP\ni  \u0303 j\ni<m d t * \u2202i a . This last condition is\n^ ^\n\u2202 \u0303i aj = gij (a).\n(9)\nj<k i<m\n\nSince the \u2202 \u0303i commute, it is necessary that\n^ ^ ^\n\u2202 \u0303h (gij (a)) = \u2202 \u0303i (ghj (a))\n\n(10)\n\nj<k i<m h<i\n\n[13, \u00a71, p. 926]. Any derivative with respect to \u2202 \u0303i of an element of K(a) is a\nconstant plus a linear combination of the derivatives \u2202 \u0303i aj , where j < l (by [14,\nFact 1.1 (0, 2)], for example); we know what these derivatives \u2202 \u0303i aj are when j < k,\n\n\f8\n\nDAVID PIERCE\n\nby (9); so (10) becomes a linear system over K(a) in the unknowns \u2202 \u0303i aj where\nk 6 j < l.\nIf k = l, then this linear system has no variables, so it is true or false; its truth\nis a sufficient condition for (8) to have a solution. If k < l, then the linear system\nis soluble or not. If it is soluble, then it is possible to extend the \u2202i to derivations\n\u2202 \u0303i as required by (9) that commute on K(a0 , . . . , ak\u22121 ); but these derivations need\nnot commute on all of K(a). In [13] I claimed that they could commute, and that\nthe solubility of (10) was sufficient for solubility of (8) in the sense above. I was\nwrong.\nA generic solution to the linear system (10) generates an extension of K(a); then\nwe have to check extensibility of the commuting derivations to this. That is, we\nare back in the same kind of situation we started with. However, it turns out that\nthere is a bound on the number of times that we need to repeat this process in\norder to ensure solubility of the original differential system. This is what is shown\nin \u00a74 below; differential forms are apparently not useful for this after all.\n3.3. A counterexample. Over a model of DF2 , let (a, b, c) be an algebraically\nindependent triple. The counterexample supplied by Hrushovski is the system\nd a = d t0 * c2 + d t1 * c,\n\nd b = d t0 * 2a + d t1 * c\n\n(11)\n\n(where c2 is the square of c; the constants (k, l) of \u00a73.1 are now (2, 3)). Equivalently,\nby (5), the system comprises the equations\n\u22020 a = c2 ,\n\n\u22021 a = c,\n\n\u22020 b = 2a,\n\n\u22021 b = c.\n\nFrom these, we compute\n\u22021 \u22020 a = 2c * \u22021 c,\n\n\u22020 \u22021 a = \u22020 c,\n\n\u22021 \u22020 b = 2 * \u22021 a = 2c,\n\n\u22020 \u22021 b = \u22020 c.\n\nEquating \u22020 \u22021 and \u22021 \u22020 yields the linear system\n\u22020 c \u2212 2c * \u22021 c = 0,\n\n\u22020 c = 2c,\n\n(12)\n\nwhich has the solution (\u22020 c, \u22021 c) = (2c, 1). But then we must have \u22021 \u22020 c = 2 *\u22021 c =\n2, while \u22020 \u22021 c = \u22020 1 = 0, which means (11) has no solution, contrary to my claim\nin [13].\nFor the record, the mistake is at the end of the proof of [13, Thm 5.7, p. 942]\nand can be seen as follows. Write the system (11) as d a = \u03b1, d b = \u03b2; then\nd \u03b1 = d c \u2227 (d t0 * 2c + d t1 ),\n\nd \u03b2 = d a \u2227 d t0 * 2 + d c \u2227 d t1\n= (d c \u2212 d t0 * 2c) \u2227 d t1 .\n\n(13)\n\nSince also d \u03b2 = d2 b = 0, we now have a condition on d c \u2227 d t1 , hence on \u22020 c;\nin particular, \u22020 c = 2c, which is what we found above. But there is no apparent\ncondition on \u22021 c, so I try introducing a new transcendental, d, for this derivative.\nBy (12) then,\nd c = d t0 * 2c + d t1 * d,\nwhich by (13) yields d \u03b1 = d t0 \u2227 d t1 * 2c(1 \u2212 d). But we must have d \u03b1 = 0, so\nd = 1, contrary to assumption. In short, the next to last sentence of the proof of\n[13, Thm 5.7] (beginning 'This ideal is linearly disjoint from') is simply wrong. (I\nhad not attempted to argue that it was correct.)\n\n\fFIELDS WITH SEVERAL COMMUTING DERIVATIONS\n\n9\n\n4. Resolution\nFor a correct understanding of the existentially closed differential fields, it is\nbetter not to introduce differential forms from the beginning, but to allow equations\nto involve any number of applications of the derivations. In contrast to 2.1 above,\nthere does not seem to be an advantage now in restricting attention to equations\nin one variable.\n4.1. Terminology. I shall now avoid working with differential polynomials as such,\nbut shall work instead with the algebraic dependencies that they determine.\nLet (K, \u22020 , . . . , \u2202m\u22121 ) |= m-DF. Higher-order derivatives with respect to the \u2202i\ncan be indexed by elements of \u03c9m : so, for \u22020 \u03c3(0) * * * \u2202m\u22121 \u03c3(m\u22121) x, we may write\n\u2202 \u03c3 x. Let 6 be the product ordering of \u03c9m . Then the derivative \u2202 \u03c3 x is below \u2202 \u03c4 x\n(and the latter is above the former) if \u03c3 6 \u03c4 . (In particular, a derivative is both\nbelow and above itself.) If n \u2208 \u03c9, then two elements of \u03c9n \u00d7 n will be related by\n6 only if they agree in the last coordinate, so that\n(\u03c3, k) 6 (\u03c4, l) \u21d0\u21d2 \u03c3 6 \u03c4 & k = l;\nwe may use the corresponding terminology of 'above' and 'below', so that \u2202 \u03c3 xk is\nbelow \u2202 \u03c4 xl if (and only if) (\u03c3,\nP k) 6 (\u03c4, l).\nIf \u03c3 \u2208 \u03c9m , let the sum i<m \u03c3(i) be denoted by |\u03c3|: this is the height of \u03c3\nor of \u2202 \u03c3 x. (Kolchin [7, \u00a7I.1, p. 59] uses the word order.) If n is a positive integer,\nlet \u03c9m \u00d7 n be (totally) ordered by P, which is taken from the left lexicographic\nordering of \u03c9m+1 by means of the embedding\n(\u03be, k) 7\u2212\u2192 (|\u03be|, k, \u03be(0), . . . , \u03be(m \u2212 2))\nm\n\nm+1\n\nof \u03c9 \u00d7 n in \u03c9\n. Then (\u03c9m \u00d7 n, P) is isomorphic to (\u03c9, 6). We may write\n(\u03c3, k) \u22b3 \u221e for all (\u03c3, k) in \u03c9m \u00d7n. Suppose (xh : h < n) is a tuple of indeterminates.\nBy ordering the formal derivatives \u2202 \u03c3 xk in terms of (\u03c3, k) and P, we have Kolchin's\nexample of an orderly ranking of derivatives [7, \u00a7I.8, p. 75]. If (\u03c3, k) \u22b3 (\u03c4, l), I shall\nsay that the derivative \u2202 \u03c3 xk is less than \u2202 \u03c4 xl or is a predecessor of \u2202 \u03c4 xl , and\n\u2202 \u03c4 xl is greater than \u2202 \u03c3 xk ; likewise for the expressions a\u03c3k and a\u03c4l , introduced\nin (15) below. (So, the terms just defined refer to the strict total ordering \u22b3, while\n'below' and 'above' refer to the partial ordering 6.)\nAddition and subtraction on \u03c9 induce corresponding operations on \u03c9m . Then\n\u03c4 6 \u03c3 + \u03c4,\n\u03c3 \u03c4\n\n\u2202 \u2202 xk = \u2202 \u03c3+\u03c4 xk ,\n(\u03c3, k) P (\u03c3 + \u03c4, k),\n\n(14)\n\n(\u03c3, k) P (\u03c4, l) \u21d0\u21d2 (\u03c3 + \u03c1, k) P (\u03c4 + \u03c1, l).\nIf i < m, let i denote the characteristic function of {i} in \u03c9m , so that \u2202 i = \u2202i , and\nmore generally \u2202i \u2202 \u03c3 = \u2202 \u03c3+i , and also \u2202i \u2202 \u03c3\u2212i = \u2202 \u03c3 if \u03c3(i) > 0.\nLet L be an extension of K with generators that are indexed by an initial segment\nof (\u03c9m \u00d7 n, P); that is,\nL = K(a\u03beh : (\u03be, h) \u22b3 (\u03c4, l)),\n\n(15)\nK(a\u03beh :\n\nwhere (\u03c4, l) \u2208 \u03c9m \u00d7 n, or possibly (\u03c4, l) = \u221e, in which case L =\n(\u03be, h) \u2208\n\u03c9m \u00d7 n). It could happen that, in the generating tuple (a\u03beh : (\u03be, h) \u22b3 (\u03c4, l)) of\nL/K, the same element of L may appear twice, with different indices. In this case,\n\n\f10\n\nDAVID PIERCE\n\nwhen writing a\u03beh , we may mean not just a particular element of L, but that element\ntogether with the pair (\u03be, h) of indices. For example, by (14), if (\u03c3 + i, k) \u22b3 (\u03c4, l),\nthen (\u03c3, k) \u22b3 (\u03c4, l); hence we may say that, if a\u03c3+i\nis one of the generators of L/K,\nk\nthen so is a\u03c3k . Let us say that L, with the tuple of generators given in (15), meets\nthe differential condition if there is no obstacle to extending each derivation \u2202i\nto a derivation Di on K(a\u03beh : (\u03be + i, h) \u22b3 (\u03c4, l)) such that\nDi a\u03c3k = a\u03c3+i\nk\n\n(16)\n\nwhenever (\u03c3 + i, k) \u22b3 (\u03c4, l). (If the right-hand member of (16) is not defined, then\nthe left need not be defined.) To be precise, if f is a rational function over K in\nvariables (x\u03beh : (\u03be, h) P (\u03c3, k)) for some (\u03c3, k) in \u03c9m \u00d7 n, and D is a derivation of K,\nthen f has a derivative Df , which is the linear function over K(x\u03beh : (\u03be, h) P (\u03c3, k))\ngiven by\nX\n\u2202f\n* yh\u03be + f D .\nDf =\n\u03be\n\u2202x\nh\n(\u03be,h)P(\u03c3,k)\nThen the differential condition is that for all such f , if (\u03c3 + i, k) \u22b3 (\u03c4, l) for some\ni in m, and if\nf (a\u03beh : (\u03be, h) P (\u03c3, k)) = 0,\n(17)\nthen \u2202i f (a\u03beh , ah\u03be+i : (\u03be, h) P (\u03c3, k)) = 0, that is,\nX\n\u2202f \u03be\n(a : (\u03be, h) P (\u03c3, k)) * a\u03b7+i\n+ f \u2202i (a\u03beh : (\u03be, h) P (\u03c3, k)) = 0.\ng\n\u2202x\u03b7g h\n\n(18)\n\n(\u03b7,g)P(\u03c3,k)\n\n(Note well the assumption that (\u03c3 + i, k) \u22b3 (\u03c4, l).

Therefore generators of L/K that are above separable leaders\nare themselves separable leaders.\n\n\fFIELDS WITH SEVERAL COMMUTING DERIVATIONS\n\n11\n\nProof. The claim follows from the basic properties of derivations, such as are gathered in [14, \u00a71]. We extend the derivations to each generator in turn, according to\nthe ordering \u22b3. Suppose Di has been defined as desired on K(a\u03beh : (\u03be, h) \u22b3 (k, \u03c3))\n(so that (16) holds whenever it applies). If a\u03c3k is not a leader, then we are free to\ndefine the derivatives Di a\u03c3k as we like. Now suppose a\u03c3k is a separable leader, and\n(\u03c3 + i, k) \u22b3 (\u03c4, l). Then Di a\u03c3k is obtained by differentiating the minimal polynomial\nof a\u03c3k over K(B). That is, Di a\u03c3k is obtained by differentiating an equation like (17);\nby the differential condition, Di a\u03c3k must be a\u03c3+i\nas given by (18); this shows that\nk\n\u03c3+i\nak is a rational function over K of its predecessors.\nFinally, in a positive characteristic p, a\u03c3k may be an inseparable leader. Then\n\u03c3 pr\n(ak ) \u2208 K(a\u03beh : (\u03be, h) \u22b3 (\u03c3, k))sep for some positive r. If (\u03c3 + i, k) \u22b3 (\u03c4, l), then\nr\nwe are free to define Di a\u03c3k as a\u03c3+i\n, provided Di ((a\u03c3k )p ) = 0. But again this\nk\ncondition is ensured by the differential condition. Indeed, we may suppose (17)\nr\nshows the separable dependence of (a\u03c3k )p over the predecessors of a\u03c3k . That is, we\nr\ncan understand f (a\u03beh : (\u03be, h) P (\u03c3, k)) as g((a\u03c3k )p ) for some separable polynomial\nr\ng over K(a\u03beh : (\u03be, h) \u22b3 (\u03c3, k)). Then Di ((a\u03c3k )p ) is obtained from (18), provided we\nr\nr\n\u03be\nreplace the term (\u2202f /\u2202x\u03c3k )(ah : (\u03be, h) P (\u03c3, k)) * a\u03c3+i\nwith g \u2032 ((a\u03c3k )p ) * Di ((a\u03c3k )p ).\nk\nBut in the present case, the former term is 0. Since, after the replacement, the\nr\nresulting equation still holds, we must have Di ((a\u03c3k )p ) = 0.\n\u0003\n4.2. A solubility condition. If (K, \u22020 , . . . , \u2202m\u22121 ) |= m-DF, then this model has\nan extension whose underlying field is the separable closure of K (as by [13,\nLem. 3.4, p. 930] and [14, Lem. 2.4, p. 1334]). We shall need this in a more\ngeneral form:\nLemma 4.2. Suppose a field M has two subfields L0 and L1 , which in turn have\na common subfield K. For each i in 2, suppose there is a derivation Di mapping\nK into Li and L1\u2212i into M . Then the bracket [D0 , D1 ] is a well-defined derivation\non K. Suppose it is the 0-derivation. Suppose also that a is an element of M\nthat is separably algebraic over K. Then each Di extends uniquely to K(a), and\nDi a \u2208 L1\u2212i (a), so D1\u2212i Di a is also well-defined. Moreover, [D0 , D1 ]a = 0.\nProof. Obvious from [14, Fact 1.1 (2)].\n\n\u0003\n\nIn a positive characteristic, the possibility of inseparably algebraic extensions\npresents a challenge, which however is handled by the following.\nTheorem 4.3. Suppose (K, \u22020 , . . . , \u2202m\u22121 ) |= m-DF, and K has an extension\nK(a\u03beh : |\u03be| 6 2r & h < n) meeting the differential condition for some positive integers r and n. Suppose further that, whenever a\u03c3k is a minimal separable leader, then\n|\u03c3| 6 r. Then (K, \u22020 , . . . , \u2202m\u22121 ) has an extension (M, D0 , . . . , Dm\u22121 ) compatible\nwith K(a\u03beh : |\u03be| < 2r & h < n).\nProof. The claim can be compared to and perhaps derived from a differential-algebraic lemma of Rosenfeld [20, \u00a7I.2], at least in characteristic 0. Here I give an\nindependent argument, for arbitrary characteristic. We shall obtain M recursively\nas K(a\u03beh : (\u03be, h) \u2208 \u03c9m \u00d7 n), at the same time proving inductively that the \u2202i can\nbe extended to Di so that (16) holds in all cases.\nLet L = K(a\u03beh : |\u03be| < 2r & h < n); this is K(a\u03beh : (\u03be, h) P ((2r\u22121, 0, . . . , 0), n\u22121)).\nThen by (18), the differential condition requires of the tuple (a\u03beh : |\u03be| = 2r & h < n)\n\n\f12\n\nDAVID PIERCE\n\nonly that it solve some linear equations over L. The hypothesis of our claim is that\nthere is a solution, namely (a\u03beh : |\u03be| = 2r & h < n). We may therefore assume that\nthis tuple is a generic solution of these equations. In particular, no entry of this\ntuple is an inseparable leader. (If, instead of being chosen generically, the entries of\n(a\u03beh : |\u03be| = 2r & h < n) were chosen from the field L, then this field would be closed\nunder the desired extensions Di of \u2202i , and the derivations Di would commute on\nthe subfield K(a\u03beh : |\u03be| + 1 < 2r & h < n); but they might not commute on all of\nL.)\nNow, as an inductive hypothesis, suppose we have the extension K(a\u03beh : (\u03be, h) \u22b3\n(\u03c4, l)) of K meeting the differential condition, so that there are derivations Di as\ngiven by Lemma 4.1; suppose also that\n(i) if a\u03c3k is a minimal separable leader, then |\u03c3| 6 r;\n(ii) if a\u03c3k is an inseparable leader, then |\u03c3| < 2r.\nWe need to choose a\u03c4l in such a way that these conditions still hold for K(a\u03beh : (\u03be, h) P\n(\u03c4, l)). The inductive hypothesis is correct when |\u03c4 | 6 2r, and then the desired conclusion follows; so we may assume |\u03c4 | > 2r. Hence, if \u03c4 (i) > 0, so that \u03c4 \u2212 i is\ndefined, then |\u03c4 \u2212 i| > 2r, so a\u03c4l \u2212i is not an inseparable leader.\nIf a\u03c4l \u2212i is not a leader at all, for any i in m, then we may let a\u03c4l be a new\ntranscendental, and we may define each derivative Di a\u03c4l \u2212i as this [14, Fact 1.1 (1)].\nIn the other case, a\u03c4l \u2212i is a separable leader for some i. Then Di a\u03c4l \u2212i is determined (Lemma 4.1). We want to let a\u03c4l be this derivative. However, possibly also\na\u03c4l \u2212j is a separable leader, where i 6= j. In this case, we must check that\nDj a\u03c4l \u2212j = Di a\u03c4l \u2212i ,\n\n(20)\n\nthat is, [Di , Dj ]al\u03c4 \u2212i\u2212j = 0.\nThere are minimal separable leaders a\u03c0l and a\u03c1l below a\u03c4l \u2212i and a\u03c4l \u2212j respectively.\nLet \u03bd be \u03c0 \u2228 \u03c1, the least upper bound of {\u03c0, \u03c1} with respect to 6. Then \u03bd 6 \u03c4 .\nBut |\u03bd| 6 |\u03c0| + |\u03c1| 6 2r < |\u03c4 |; so \u03bd < \u03c4 . Hence \u03bd 6 \u03c4 \u2212 k for some k in m, which\nmeans a\u03bdl is below a\u03c4l \u2212k . Consequently,\n(i) a\u03c0l is below both a\u03c4l \u2212i and a\u03c4l \u2212k ;\n(ii) a\u03c1l is below both a\u03c4l \u2212j and a\u03c4l \u2212k .\nIf k = j, then a\u03c0l is below al\u03c4 \u2212i\u2212j , so this is a separable leader. As Di and Dj\ncommute on K(a\u03beh : (\u03be, h) \u22b3 (\u03c4 \u2212 i \u2212 j, l)) by the differential condition, they must\ncommute also at al\u03c4 \u2212i\u2212j (Lemma 4.2), so (20) is established. The argument is the\nsame if k = i. If k is different from i and j, then again the same argument yields\nDj a\u03c4l \u2212j = Dk a\u03c4l \u2212k and Dk a\u03c4l \u2212k = Di a\u03c4l \u2212i , so (20) holds.\nIn no case did we introduce a new minimal separable leader or an inseparable\nleader. This completes the induction and the proof.\n\u0003\nIn terms of differential polynomials and ideals, the theorem can be understood\nas follows. Given the hypothesis of the theorem, let S be the set of differential polynomials f (\u2202 \u03be xh : |\u03be| < 2r & h < n), where f ranges over the ordinary polynomials\nover K such that f (a\u03beh : |\u03be| < 2r & h < n) = 0. Then S includes a characteristic\nset for the differential ideal that it generates.\n\n\fFIELDS WITH SEVERAL COMMUTING DERIVATIONS\n\n13\n\nWe can now characterize the existentially closed models of m-DF by means of\nthe following lemma. The lemma follows from unproved statements in [7, \u00a70.17,\np. 49]; let's just prove it here.\nLemma 4.4. For every m in \u03c9 and positive integer n, every antichain of (\u03c9m \u00d7\nn, 6) is finite.\nProof. The general case follows from the case when n = 1, since if S is an antichain\nof (\u03c9m \u00d7 n, 6), then\n[\n{(\u03be, h) \u2208 S : h = j},\nS=\nj<n\n\nand each component of the union is in bijection with an antichain of (\u03c9m , 6). As\nan inductive hypothesis, suppose every antichain of (\u03c9l , 6) is finite; but suppose\nalso, if possible, that there is an infinite antichain S of (\u03c9l+1 , 6). Then S contains\nsome \u03c3. By inductive hypothesis, the subset\n[ [\n{\u03be \u2208 S : \u03be(j) = i}\nj6l i6\u03c3(j)\n\nof S is a finite union of finite sets, so its complement in S has infinitely many\nelements \u03c4 ; but then \u03c3 < \u03c4 , so S was not an antichain.\n\u0003\nTheorem 4.5. Suppose (K, \u22020 , . . . , \u2202m\u22121 ) |= m-DF. Then the following are equivalent:\n(i) The model (K, \u22020 , . . . , \u2202m\u22121 ) of m-DF is existentially closed.\n(ii) For all positive integers r and n, if K has an extension K(a\u03beh : |\u03be| 6 2r &\nh < n) meeting the differential condition such that |\u03c3| 6 r whenever a\u03c3k\nis a minimal separable leader, then the tuple (a\u03beh : |\u03be| < 2r & h < n) has\na specialization (\u2202 \u03be bh : |\u03be| < 2r & h < n) for some tuple (bh : h < n) of\nelements of K.\nProof. Assume (i) and the hypothesis of (ii). Let S be a (finite) generating set of\nthe ideal of (a\u03beh : |\u03be| < 2r & h < n) over K. By Theorem 4.3, the system\n^\nf (\u2202 \u03be xh : |\u03be| < 2r & h < n) = 0\nf \u2208S\n\nhas a solution in some extension, hence it has a solution in K itself, which means\nthe conclusion of (ii) holds. So (ii) is necessary for (i).\nEvery system over (K, \u22020 , . . . , \u2202m\u22121 ) is equivalent to a system of equations. Suppose such a system has a solution (ah : h < n) in some extension (L, D0 , . . . , Dm\u22121 ).\nThen the extension K(\u2202 \u03be ah : (\u03be, h) \u2208 (\u03c9m \u00d7 n)) has a finite set of minimal separable leaders, by Lemma 4.4, since this set is indexed by an antichain of (\u03c9m \u00d7 n, 6).\nHence there is r large enough that all of these minimal separable leaders are also\ngenerators of K(D\u03be ah : |\u03be| 6 r & h < n). We may assume also that r is large\nenough that |\u03c3| 6 r for every derivative \u2202 \u03c3 xk that appears in the original system.\nThe hypothesis of (ii) is now satisfied when each a\u03c3k is taken as D\u03c3 ak . If the conclusion of (ii) follows, then (bh : h < n) is a solution of the original system. Thus, (ii)\nis sufficient for (i).\n\u0003\nCorollary 4.6. The theory m-DF has a model-companion, m-DCF.\n\n\f14\n\nDAVID PIERCE\n\nProof. Let (K, \u22020 , . . . , \u2202m\u22121 ) be a model of m-DF, let L be an extension K(a\u03beh : |\u03be| 6\n2r & h < n) of K meeting the differential condition, and suppose |\u03c3| 6 r whenever\na\u03c3k is a minimal separable leader. That is, assume the hypothesis of Condition (ii) of\nthe theorem. Write a for (a\u03beh : |\u03be| < 2r & h < n) and b for (a\u03beh : |\u03be| = 2r & h < n),\nso that L = K(a, b). The ideal of K[x, y] comprising the polynomials that are 0\nat (a, b) is generated by a set {f (p, x, y) : f \u2208 T }, where T is a finite subset of\nZ[z, x, y], and p is a (finite) list of parameters from K. We may assume that T has\na subset S, where S \u2286 Z[z, x] and {g(p, x) : g \u2208 S} generates the ideal of a. We\nneed to ensure that there is a formula \u03c6(z) such that\n(i) \u03c6(p) holds in (K, \u22020 , . . . , \u2202m\u22121 );\n(ii) for every model (K, \u22020 , . . . , \u2202m\u22121 ) of m-DF and every tuple q from K,\nif \u03c6(q) holds in the model, then the polynomials f (q, x, y) (where f \u2208\nT ) generate over K a prime ideal, a generic zero of which generates an\nextension of K as in the hypothesis of Condition (ii) of the theorem.\nIn this case, by the theorem, m-DCF will have, as axioms, the axioms of m-DF,\nalong with one sentence of the form\n\u0011\n\u0010^\n^ ^ ^\nxh\u03be+i = \u2202i x\u03beh .\n\u03c6(z) \u21d2 \u2203x\ng(z, x) = 0 &\ng\u2208S\n\ni<m h<n |\u03be+i|<2r\n\nfor each model (K, \u22020 , . . . , \u2202m\u22121 ) of m-DF and each extension K(a\u03beh : |\u03be| 6 2r &\nh < n) as above.\nSo now we must show that the formula \u03c6 exists as desired; that is, we must show\nthat there are first-order conditions on the parameters p as required. This we can\ndo as follows.\nThat the ideal I generated by some finite set of polynomials is a prime ideal-\nthis condition is a first-order condition on the parameters of the polynomials, by\nvan den Dries and Schmidt [29]. (As they point out, the results of theirs that we\nshall use are not original with them; the proofs are original.) In particular, there\nis some N depending only on the degrees of the generating polynomials and their\nnumbers of variables such that if f g \u2208 I \u21d2 f \u2208 I \u2228 g \u2208 I for all polynomials f and\ng of degree less than N , then the implication holds for all f and g.\nHere I may be the ideal of (a, b) or of a, defined in terms of T or S as above.\nThe extension K(a, b) meets the differential condition, because the derivatives of\neach g(p, x) (where g \u2208 S) are certain combinations (which can be made explicit)\nof the f (p, x, y) (where f \u2208 T ). Thus there is a sufficient first-order condition on\nthe parameters p for the meeting of the differential condition; and p does meet this\ncondition.\nAlternatively, if a polynomial F and finitely many additional polynomials G with\nparameters p are given, the condition that F be a member of the ideal I generated\nby the G is a first-order condition on p. This follows from the existence of a uniform\nbound on the degrees of the polynomial coefficients needed to obtain F from the\npolynomials G if indeed F \u2208 I. This bound is uniform in the sense that it depends\nonly on the degrees of F and the G and the number of their variables. The existence\nof this bound is again shown by van den Dries and Schmidt [29].\nMoreover, for a list w of variables that appear in the polynomials G, the condition\nthat no non-zero polynomial in w alone belongs to I is also a first-order condition\non p. Indeed, since this condition is invariant under replacement of the underlying\nfield by its algebraic closure, we may appeal to the general result that Morley rank\n\n\fFIELDS WITH SEVERAL COMMUTING DERIVATIONS\n\n15\n\nis definable in algebraically closed fields and more generally in strongly minimal\nsets [11, \u00a76.2]. For some formula \u03c8, the condition holds if and only if \u03c8(p) is true\nin the algebraic closure of the underlying field; but by quantifier-elimination in\nalgebraically closed fields, we may assume also \u03c8 is quantifier-free, so \u03c8(p) is true\nin the algebraic closure of a field if and only if it is true in the field itself.\nFor each leader in (a, b), we may assume that some irreducible polynomial in\nT shows that it is a leader. The irreducibility of this polynomial is a first-order\ncondition on p (since in general primeness of ideals is first-order). The leader is\nseparable if and only if the formal derivative of its irreducible polynomial is not\nzero, that is, not all of its coefficients belong to the ideal generated by {f (p, x, y) :\nf \u2208 T }; as noted above, this is a first-order condition. The condition that an entry\nin (a, b) is not a leader at all is also a first-order condition on the parameters, since\nthis condition is just that no non-zero polynomial in certain variables belongs to\nthe ideal generated by {f (p, x, y) : f \u2208 T }.\nNow we can arrange that \u03c6(z) establishes all of the conditions discussed; and\nthis is enough.\n\u0003\nBy Theorem 3.1, DFm now also has a model-companion.\n4.3. Differential forms again. The condition in Theorem 4.3 can be adjusted to\nyield the following:\nTheorem 4.7. Suppose (K, \u22020 , . . . , \u2202m\u22121 ) |= m-DF, and K has an extension\nK(a\u03beh : |\u03be| 6 |\u03bc| & h < n) meeting the differential condition for some \u03bc in \u03c9m\nand some positive integer n. Suppose further that, if a\u03c3k is a minimal separable\nleader, then \u03c3 6 \u03bc. Then (K, \u22020 , . . . , \u2202m\u22121 ) has an extension compatible with\nK(a\u03beh : |\u03be| < |\u03bc| & h < n).\nProof. The proof is as for Theorem 4.3, mutatis mutandis. What needs adjusting\nis the choosing of a\u03c4l in case both a\u03c4l \u2212i and a\u03c4l \u2212j are separable leaders. Again we\nhave minimal separable leaders a\u03c0l and a\u03c1l below a\u03c4l \u2212i and a\u03c4l \u2212j respectively. Since\nwe may assume |\u03bc| < |\u03c4 |, there is some k in m such that \u03bc(k) < \u03c4 (k). If k = j,\nthen \u03c0(j) 6 \u03bc(j) < \u03c4 (j), so \u03c0(j) 6 (\u03c4 \u2212 j)(j) = (\u03c4 \u2212 i \u2212 j)(j). Then \u03c0 6 \u03c4 \u2212 i \u2212 j,\nso a\u03c0l is below al\u03c4 \u2212i\u2212j . Now we can proceed as before.\n\u0003\nAs Theorem 4.3 yields Theorem 4.5, so Theorem 4.7 yields a characterization of\nthe existentially closed models of m-DF. Moreover, Theorems 4.3 and 4.7 can be\ncombined in the following way:\nTheorem 4.8. Suppose (K, \u22020 , . . . , \u2202m\u22121 ) |= m-DF, and K has an extension\nK(a\u03beh : |\u03be| 6 2r & h < n) meeting the differential condition for some positive integers n and r. Suppose further that, for each k in m, either |\u03c3| 6 r whenever a\u03c3k is\na minimal separable leader, or else there is some \u03c4 in \u03c9m such that |\u03c4 | = 2r, and\n|\u03c3| 6 |\u03c4 | whenever a\u03c3k is a minimal separable leader. Then (K, \u22020 , . . . , \u2202m\u22121 ) has\nan extension compatible with K(a\u03beh : |\u03be| < 2r & h < n).\nProof. Combine the proofs of Theorems 4.3 and 4.7.\n\n\u0003\n\nThere is a corresponding first-order characterization of the models of m-DCF,\nparallel to Theorem 4.5 and Corollary 4.6.\n\n\f16\n\nDAVID PIERCE\n\n4.4. Another sufficient condition. If (K, \u22020 , . . . , \u2202m\u22121 ) |= m-DF, and K(a\u03beh : |\u03be| 6\n|\u03c0| & h < n) is an extension L of K meeting the differential condition, this by itself\nis not enough to ensure that (K, \u22020 , . . . , \u2202m\u22121 ) has an extension compatible with\nL. However, if such an extension does exist, then its existence can be shown by\nmeans of Theorem 4.3, provided |\u03c0| can be made large enough: this is Theorem 4.10\nbelow, which relies on the existence of bounds as in the following.\nLemma 4.9. For all positive integers m and n, for all sequences (ai : i \u2208 \u03c9) of\npositive integers, there is a bound on the length of strictly increasing chains\nS0 \u2282 S1 \u2282 S2 \u2282 * * *\n\n(21)\n\nm\n\nof antichains Sk of (\u03c9 \u00d7 n, 6), where also Sk \u2286 {(\u03be, h) : |\u03be| 6 ak }.\nProof. Divide and conquer. First reduce to the case when n = 1. Indeed, suppose\nthe claim does hold in this case. Suppose also, as an inductive hypothesis, that\nthe claim holds when n = l. Now fix m and the sequence (ai : i \u2208 \u03c9) or rather\n(a(i) : i \u2208 \u03c9), and consider arbitrary chains as in (21), where n = l + 1. Analyze\neach Sk as Sk\u2032 \u222a Sk\u2032\u2032 , where\nSk\u2032 = {(\u03be, h) \u2208 Sk : h < l},\n\nSk\u2032\u2032 = {(\u03be, h) \u2208 Sk : h = l}.\n\n\u2032\nFor each k such that Sk+1 exists, at least one of the inclusions Sk\u2032 \u2286 Sk+1\nand\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\nSk \u2286 Sk+1 is strict; also, by our assumption, there is an upper bound f (k) on those\nr such that\n\u2032\u2032\n\u2032\u2032\nSk\u2032\u2032 \u2282 Sk+1\n\u2282 * * * \u2282 Sr\u22121\n.\n(22)\nThe function f depends only on m and (ai : i \u2208 \u03c9)), not on the choice of chain\nin (21).\nLet k(0) = 0, and if k(i) has been chosen, let k(i + 1) be the least r, if it exists,\n\u2032\nsuch that Sk(i)\n\u2282 Sr\u2032 . Here k(i) does depend on the chain. But if r is maximal\nin (22), and Sr\u2032 exists, then Sk\u2032 \u2282 Sr\u2032 . Hence k(i + 1) 6 f (k(i)). Since the function\nf is not necessarily increasing, we derive from it the increasing function g, where\ng(k) = maxi6k f (i). Then x 6 y =\u21d2 g(x) 6 g(y), so\nr\n\nz }| {\nk(r) 6 f (k(r\u22121)) 6 g(k(r\u22121)) 6 g\u25e6g(k(r\u22122)) 6 * * * 6 g \u25e6 * * * \u25e6 g(0) = g r (0). (23)\n\nIn particular, Sk(r) \u2286 {(\u03be, h) : |\u03be| 6 a(g r (0))}. The sequence (a(g i (0)) : i \u2208 \u03c9) does\nnot depend on the original chain. Hence the inductive hypothesis applies to the\nchain\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2282 *** ,\n(24)\n\u2282 Sk(1)\nSk(0)\nshowing that there is s (independent of the original chain) such that k(s) is defined,\n\u2032\nand r 6 s for all entries Sk(r)\nin (24). Hence also, by (23), if Sr\u2032 is an entry in (24),\nthen r 6 k(s) 6 g s (0).\n\u2032\u2032\nNow suppose Sr\u2032 is the final entry in (24). Then Sr\u2032\u2032 \u2282 Sr+1\n\u2282 * * * ; but if St\u2032\u2032 is\ns\ns+1\nan entry of this chain, then t < f (r) 6 g(r) 6 g(g (0)) = g (0).\nTherefore the original chain in (21) has a final entry St , where t < g s+1 (0). Thus\nthe claim holds when n = l + 1. By induction, the claim holds for all positive n,\nprovided it holds when n = 1.\nIt remains to show that, for all positive m, for all sequences (ai : i \u2208 \u03c9), there is\na bound on the length of chains\nS0 \u2282 S1 \u2282 S2 \u2282 * * *\n\n(25)\n\n\fFIELDS WITH SEVERAL COMMUTING DERIVATIONS\n\n17\n\nof antichains Sk of (\u03c9m , 6), where Sk \u2286 {\u03be : |\u03be| 6 ak }. The claim is trivially true\nwhen m = 1. Suppose it is true when m = l. Now let m = l + 1, and suppose we\nhave a chain as in (25). We may assume that S0 contains some \u03c3. If i < m and\nj \u2208 \u03c9, let\nSki, j = {\u03be \u2208 Sk : \u03be(i) = j}.\nThen the inductive hypothesis applies to chains of the form\ni, j\ni, j\ni, j\nSk(0)\n\u2282 Sk(1)\n\u2282 Sk(2)\n\u2282 *** .\n\nMoreover, if \u03c4 \u2208 Sk , then \u03c4 (i) 6 \u03c3(i) for some i in m (since \u03c3 is also in Sk , and\nthis is an antichain). Hence\n[ [ i, j\nSk ,\nSk =\ni<m j6\u03c3(i)\n\na union of no more than |\u03c3| + m-many sets, hence no more than a0 + m-many sets.\nSo the proof can proceed as in the reduction to n = 1: for each k such that Sk+1\ni, j\nexists, one of the inclusions Ski, j \u2286 Sk+1\nis strict, and so forth.\n\u0003\nTheorem 4.10. Suppose m, r, and n are positive integers. Then there is a positive\ninteger s, where r 6 s, such that, if (K, \u22020 , . . . , \u2202m\u22121 ) |= m-DF, and K(a\u03beh : |\u03be| 6\ns & h < n) meets the differential condition, then (K, \u22020 , . . . , \u2202m\u22121 ) has an extension\nthat is compatible with K(a\u03beh : |\u03be| 6 r & h < n).\nProof. Suppose K(a\u03beh : |\u03be| 6 2t r & h < n) meets the differential condition for\nsome t. When u 6 t, let Ku = K(a\u03beh : |\u03be| 6 2u r & h < n), and let Su be the set\nof minimal separable leaders of Ku . Then we have an increasing chain S0 \u2286 S1 \u2286\n. . . \u2286 St . By the preceding lemma, there is a value of t, depending only on m, r,\nand n, large enough that this chain cannot be strictly increasing. Then Su = Su+1\nfor some u less than this t. Then Ku+1 satisfies the hypothesis of Theorem 4.3. So\n(K, \u22020 , . . . , \u2202m\u22121 ) has an extension compatible with K(a\u03beh : |\u03be| < 2u+1 r & h < n),\nand a fortiori with K(a\u03beh : |\u03be| 6 r & h < n). In short, the desired s is 2t r.\n\u0003\nThis theorem yields yet another first-order characterization of the models of\nm-DCF.\nReferences\n[1] Jon Barwise and Abraham Robinson, Completing theories by forcing, Ann.
