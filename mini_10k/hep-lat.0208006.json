Introduction\nFinite density QCD has attracted much attention recently: we are expecting that QCD has a\nrich structure when we add a density or chemical potential axis in parameter space. The finite\ntemperature deconfinement transition line starts\nat \u03bc = 0, which might be a cross-over accompanied by a tri-critical point at finite \u03bc. At high\n\u03bc and relatively low temperature, there would be\na new form of matter such as color superconductive phase, or color-flavor locking phase, which\nare speculated by mainly perturbative calculations [1].\nNon-perturbative study of the finite density\nQCD by lattice simulations is highly required, but\nbecause of the famous difficulty, the direct Monte\nCarlo simulation of SU(3) system is very difficult.\nMany approaches have been reported, [2\u20136], and\nyet, no reliable algorithm is known to investigate\ncolor SU(3) QCD at low temperature with large\nchemical potential. Color-SU(2) is currently the\nunique model by which we can study these regions non-perturbatively. After the first trial of\nthe calculation[7], there had been no work during\nmany years. Because of the recent rapid progress\nof theoretical understanding of the system [8,9],\nhowever, the calculation has been activated [10\u2013\n\u2217 Presenter\n\n12].\nIn this report, we study the finite density QCD\nby Wilson fermions. We investigate the phase\nstructure in (\u03ba, \u03bc)-plane for Iwasaki improvedgauge action. In order to take account of the\nfermion determinant, we use an algorithm in\nwhich the ratio of the determinant is evaluated\nexplicitly at each Metropolis update process [13].\n2. Phase Structure\nIn Fig.1, we show the average of Polyakov line\nin (\u03ba, \u03bc)-plane at \u03b2 = 0.7. We evaluate also\nbaryon number density, gluon energy density and\nPolyakov line susceptibility, and especially from\nthe peak of the Polyakov line susceptibility we can\ndetermine the confinement/deconfinement phase\ntransition regions. In both bounday conditions2 ,\nthe behaviors of these quantities are essentially\nthe same [13].\nWe study several cases by varying lattice size\n(44 , 43 \u00d7 8, 43 \u00d7 12), the boundary conditions and\nthe number of flavor (Nf = 2, 3).\nCalculations become unstable and break down\nat large chemical potential regions[13]. In such\ncases, negative determinant appears for Nf = 3.\n2 Periodic (anti-periodic) refers the periodic (anti-periodic)\nboundary condition for quark fields in spatial directions.\n\n\f2\n\n<L>\n0.6\n\nmass\n\n1.5\n\n0.4\n0.2\n\n1.0\n\n\u03c0\n\u03c1\n\n0.5\n0.8\n0.15\n\n0.0\n0.0\n\n0.6\n0.16\n\n0.4\n0.17\n\n\u03ba\n\n0.18\n\n0.2\n0.19\n\n0\n\n\u03bca\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n\u03bca\n\nFigure 1.

Meson and diquark propagators\n\n4. Force between qq / q\u0304q\n\nWe calculate meson and di-quark propagators\nin pseudo-scalar and vector channels. We find\nthat \u03c1 meson mass drops as \u03bc reaches to the\ncritical region. In order to confirm this unexpected result, we calculate both periodic and\nanti-periodic boundary conditions and several \u03ba's\n(\u03ba = 0.150, 0.160, 0.175). In Fig.2 we show \u03c0 and\n\u03c1 masses as a function of \u03bc for \u03ba = 0.160 (periodic boundary condition). Although our statistic\nis not enough to extrapolate them to the chiral\nlimit, the signal of the anomalous behavior of the\nvector channel is clearly seen.\nAt \u03bc = 0, because of the QCD inequality [9],\nthe pseudo-scalar channel has the lightest mass,\nbut there is no such a condition for the finite\ndensity state. Indeed there are several conjectures in literatures [14]. If our result shown in\nFig.2 is not a special feature of the color SU(2)\nmodel, this is the first lattice observation of the\ndrop of the vector meson mass which may play\nan important role in the phenomenological analyses on large low-mass lepton-pair enhancement\nmeasured in CERES [15].\nAnother possibility is that the vector meson\nchannel is mixed with the vector diquark one,\n\u03c8 c \u03b35 \u03b3\u03bc \u03c8, at high \u03bc and their masses are distorted3 . In this case, we can study \"meson\" and\n\"diquark\" mixing in color SU(2) QCD.\n\nIn the previous section, we show that the vector meson may have a peculiar behavior at finite\ndensity. Above \u03bcc at low temperature, the condensation of qq may occur. We need tools to understand the vacuum structure numerically.\nFrom Polyakov line correlations, color average\nheavy quark potential is calculated. One can\nalso obtain color singlet (V1 ) and triplet potential (V3 ) for q q\u0304 system: Nc \u00d7 N\u0304c = 1 \u2295 (Nc2 \u2212 1)\n[16]. Color symmetric (Vs ) and anti-symmetric\n(Va ) potential for qq system can be also evaluated: Nc \u00d7 Nc = 21 Nc (Nc + 1) \u2295 21 Nc (Nc \u2212 1).\nIn color SU(2), V1 = Va and V3 = Vs even at\n\u03bc 6= 0. Therefore if there would exist difference\nbetween qq and q q\u0304 states, it should originate in\nDirac structure.\nIn Fig.3, we plot preliminary data of color singlet potential. The rotational invariance is good\nby virtue of the renormalization group improved\ngauge action. The singlet (triplet) potential is attractive (repulsive) and the forces become weaker\nas \u03bc increases. We fix the gauge in Lorentz gauge\nfor the color-dependent force and gluon propagators discussed in the following.\nWe study gluon propagators as a tool to investigate the finite density QCD,\nG\u03bc\u03bd (P0 , Px , Py , z) = hTrA\u03bc (P0 , Px , Py , z)\n\u00d7A\u03bd (\u2212P0 , \u2212Px , \u2212Py , 0)i.\n\n(1)\n\n3 We\n\nthank Thomas Schaefer for useful discussions on\n\u03c8\u0304\u03b3\u03bc \u03c8/\u03c8c \u03b35 \u03b3\u03bc \u03c8 mixing .\n\nWe\n\nset\n\nthe\n\nmomenta\n\nas\n\n(P0 , Px , Py )\n\n=\n\n\f3\n0.1\n\n\u03bc=0.0\n\u03bc=0.4\n\u03bc=0.6\n\u03bc=0.7\n\nV1\n\n10\n\n\u03bc=0.0\n\u03bc=0.4\n\u03bc=0.6\n\u03bc=0.7\n\n<Ay(0)*Ay(z)>\n\n0\n\n1\n-0.1\n\n0.1\n1\n\n-0.2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\nR\n\n6\n\n8\n\n7\n\nFigure 3.

The electric and magnetic parts of\nthe propagator, Ge = Gtt and Gm = Gyy , are expected to behave as, Ge(m) (z) \u221d exp(\u2212Ee(m) z).\nWhen the system is screened at the finite temperature and/or finite density,p\nthe screening effects should\nappear\nas\nE\n=\n(Px2 + Me2 ) and\ne\np\n2 ), with M and M\n(Px2 + Mm\nEm =\ne\nm being\nelectric and magnetic masses of the gluons, respectively. At T = 0 and \u03bc = 0 the screening is\ninfinite and the propagators vanish at long distance [17].\nWe show in Fig.4 a preliminary result for\nGm (z). As \u03bc increases, the screening becomes\nweaker, i.e., the system shows the deconfinement\nfeature, but at \u03bc = 0.7 the propagator at long\nrange seems to drop. It is an urgent future task\nto confirm the phenomena, because it could be an\nindication of a new phase at large \u03bc.\nAcknowledgment This work is partially supported by Grant-in-Aide for Scientific Research\nby Monbu-Kagaku-sho (No.11440080 and No.\n12554008) and ERI of Tokuyama Univ.
