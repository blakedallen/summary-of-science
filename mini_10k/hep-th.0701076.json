Usberti 7A, 43100 Parma, Italy\nand INFN, Sezione di Milano Bicocca, Gruppo di Parma\nemail: name(at)fis.unipr.it\n\nAbstract\nIdeas and techniques (asymptotic decoupling of single-trace subspace, asymptotic operator algebras, duality and role of supersymmetry) relevant in current\nFock space investigations of quantum field theories have very simple roles in a class\nof toy models.\n\nHamiltonian methods have a long history in the attempts to understand the\nbound states spectrum of a strongly interacting relativistic quantum field theory.\nThis is perhaps the hardest and most important problem in a strongly interacting\nquantum field theory and analytic and numerical efforts were devoted to invent\nreliable methods. For several years light-front quantization [1] was a promising approach because of the very different nature of the ground state and some important\nsimplifications of the operators occurring in the hamiltonian of non-abelian models.\nThe analysis of the large-N limit, at t'Hooft coupling fixed, of the models with\nSU (N ) or U (N ) invariance, provided additional insights, indicating features of\nstring theory in non-abelian gauge models and the existence of symmetries, conserved quantum numbers and operator algebras occurring only in the asymptotic\ntheory, at N = \u221e, [2], [3], [6], [13]. Much work was devoted to the evaluation of the\nspectrum of the Hamiltonian for states in the lowest representation of the group :\nthe singlet sector and the adjoint sector.\nA color-singlet state of n free bosons, with total momentum P~ is represented in\nthe Fock space by a linear superposition of states of the form\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n(1)\ntr a\u2020 (k1 ) * * * a\u2020 (kn1 ) tr a\u2020 (p1 ) * * * a\u2020 (pn2 ) * * * tr a\u2020 (q 1 ) * * * a\u2020 (q ns ) 0\n\nwhere trP\n() denotes P\nthe trace on U (N ) colour indices, n = n1 + n2 + * * * + ns , P =\nP\nkj + pj + * * * q j and a\u2020 (k) are creation operators. These states are called\nmulti-trace states. P\nMatrix-valued operators\nP may be written in terms of the group\ngenerators a(k) = a \u03bba aa (k), a\u2020 (k) = a \u03bba a\u2020a (k), and all matrix-related coefficients are efficiently evaluated by graphic methods [5, 9]. Several remarkable properties were found in the large-N limit. Operators normally\u2013ordered inside a single\u0001\ntrace, that is of the form \u03b3 = N \u2212(r+s\u22122)/2 tr a\u2020 (k1 ) * * * a\u2020 (kr ) a(p1 ) * * * a(ps ) , acting on single-trace states generate single-trace states [6], provided r \u2265 1 and s \u2265 1.\nThen if the Hamiltonian is a linear combination of such operators, the subspace of\nthe Fock space spanned by single-trace states is invariant under the action of the\nHamiltonian. These operators and analogous ones involving fermion operators act\non single-trace states in a way reminiscent of the coupling of strings. Single-trace\n1\n\n\f2\n\n\u0001\nstates like n = N \u2212n/2 n\u22121/2 tr a\u2020 (k1 ) * * * a\u2020 (kn ) 0 form an orthonormal basis\nin the color-singlet and single-trace Fock space [4]. Multi-trace states like in eq.(1)\nprovide an orthonormal basis in the color-singlet Fock space at N = \u221e [4].\nRecently G. Veneziano and J. Wosiek [7] suggested a supersymmetric model in\nD = 1 space-time dimension, that is a matrix quantum mechanical model. It is\nnot surprising that the model is analytically solvable in the large-N limit in several\nsectors of the Fock space and reliable numerical evaluations may be performed in\nother sectors. Several features of the bound states are very interesting.\nThe goal of this letter is to use results derived in recent analysis of the bosonic\nsector of the model [8] and in a simple generalization presented here, to comment\non the properties of V-W hamiltonian with a view to the role they may have in\nmodels in more realistic space-time dimension.\nIn the bosonic sector the Hamiltonian of the V-W model is\n\u0001\n\u0001\n(2)\nH = tr a\u2020 a + g a\u20202 a + a\u2020 a2 + g 2 a\u20202 a2 , \u03bb = g 2 N\n\nIn the single trace sector of the singlet states, for large N , the Hamiltonian is a\ntridiagonal real symmetric infinite matrix. The bound states spectrum was analytically and numerically solved in the large-N limit for every \u03bb \u2265 0 and it presents\nremarkable features:\n\u2022 the infinitely many eigenvalues of the discrete spectrum of the model, for\n0 \u2264 \u03bb < 1 decrease in a monotonous way as \u03bb increases and all vanish at\n\u03bb = 1, where a phase transition occurs. For \u03bb > 1 one eigenvalue remains\nat zero energy, it is a new ground state, and the infinitely many eigenvalues\nincrease in a monotonous way as \u03bb increases.\n\u2022 The non-zero eigenvalues at the pairs of values \u03bb and 1/\u03bb are related by a\nduality property\n\u0012 \u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u221a\n1\n1\n1\n\u221a (En (\u03bb) \u2212 \u03bb)) = \u03bb En \u221a\n\u2212\n(3)\n\u03bb\n\u03bb\n\u03bb\nLet us consider the trivial generalization of eq.(2) by allowing two coupling constants\n\u221a\n\u0001 p\nH = tr a\u2020 a + g3 (a\u20202 a + a\u2020 a2 ) + g42 a\u20202 a2 , \u03bb3 = g3 N , \u03bb4 = g42 N\nHere too the single-trace sector in the Fock space decouples in the large-N limit\nand the hamiltonian is represented by the tridiagonal real symmetric infinite matrix\nH(\u03bb3 , \u03bb4 )\np p\nHj,j+1 = Hj+1,j = \u03bb3 j(j + 1) ,\n\n(4)\n\nHj,j = (1 + \u03bb4 (1 \u2212 \u03b41j )) j , j = 1, 2, . . .\n\nThe eigenvalue equation Hx = Ex is a system of recurrent relations which\nP\u221etrans-j\nlates into an easy\ndifferential\nequation\nfor\nthe\ngenerating\nfunction\nG(z)\n=\n1 yj z\n\u221a\nwhere xj = yj j.\n\u0010\np \u0011\np\n\u03bb3 \u03c9(z)G\u2032 (z) \u2212 E G(z) \u2212 z\u03bb4 + \u03bb3 G\u2032 (0) = 0 ,\np\nwhere \u03c9(z) = z 2 + 1 + z(1 + \u03bb4 )/ \u03bb3\n\nIf (1 + \u03bb4 )2 \u2212 4\u03bb3 > 0, \u03c9(z) has 2 distinct real roots.

The graph shows F (\u03b1, 1; 1 + \u03b1; \u03c3) for 3 values \u03c3 = 0.3, 0.5, 0.7 depicted\nwith increasingly dark color.\nIn the space of parameters corresponding to bound states, let us consider the\n\u0010\n\u00112\n4\nparabolas of equation \u03bb3 = \u03c3\u0304 1+\u03bb\n, see Fig.1. At each point of the space of cou1+\u03c3\u0304\npling constants corresponding to the discrete spectrum there is a unique \u03c3\u0304. For a\ngiven parabola, it is easy to describe the spectrum as we move along it from \u03bb4 = 0\nto \u03bb4 = \u221e. Indeed along this path, the value of \u03b7 increases in a monotonous way\nfrom \u03b7 = \u2212\u221e to \u03b7 = 0 at the point where it first crosses the line \u03bb4 = \u03bb3 , next it\nreaches \u03b7 = 1 at the second crossing with the same line, and continues increasing\nup to its asymptotic limit \u03b7 = 1/(1 \u2212 \u03c3\u0304 2 ).\nAt \u03b7 = \u2212\u221e the eigenvalue equation has infinitely many solution of the form\n\u03b1n = \u2212n + \u01ebn where n = 1, 2, * * * and \u01ebn are small positive numbers. That is\nEn = n(1 \u2212 \u03c3\u0304)/(1 + \u03c3\u0304) \u2212 \u01ebn . As \u03b7 increases all roots \u03b1n move in a monotonous way\nto the right, that is each En decrease. At \u03b7 = 1, the value of \u03b11 = 0 and E1 = 0.\nThis bound state becames degenerate with the vacuum state |0 > of the Fock space,\nwhich has E0 = 0. As \u03b7 increases beyond \u03b7 = 1, \u03b11 increases to positive values and\nE1 has increasingly negative values [11].\nAt the first crossing \u03bb3 = \u03bb4 = \u03bb < 1, \u03b7 = 0, \u03c3\u0304 = \u03bb and we may consider the\nroots \u03b1n + 1 of the eigenvalue equation F (\u03b1n + 1, 1; \u03b1n + 2; \u03bb) = 0. Because of\nthe translation identity eq.(5) they are simply related to the roots \u03b1n of the eigenvalue equation at the second crossing \u03bb3 = \u03bb4 = \u03bb > 1, \u03b7 = 1, \u03c3\u0304 = 1/\u03bb, which is\nF (\u03b1n , 1; \u03b1n + 1; 1/\u03bb) = 1. This is the V-W duality of eq.(3).\nThis picture looks very different from the V-W spectrum but, of course, it is fully\ncompatible : in the V-W model the unique coupling moves along the line \u03bb4 = \u03bb3\nand it touches at \u03bb = 1 the boundary of normalizable eigenstates.\nWe now briefly describe the solution of the 2-couplings model by use of a non\u2013\ncompact Lie algebra which arises in the large N limit.\n\n\f5\n\nLet us consider the Hamiltonian H\u0303(\u03b1, \u03b2)\nH\u0303(\u03b1, \u03b2) = \u03b1 D + 12 \u03b2(J+ + J\u2212 ) ,\np\nDij = j\u03b4ij , (J+ )ij = j(j + 1)\u03b4i,j+1 ,\np\nJ\u00b1 = Jx \u00b1 iJy , \u03b1 = 1 + \u03bb4 , \u03b2 = 2 \u03bb3\n\nJ\u2212 = (J+ )\u2020\n\nThe Hamiltonian H\u0303(\u03b1, \u03b2) differs from the asymptotic Hamiltonian H(\u03bb3 , \u03bb4 )\ngiven in eq.(4) only for one matrix element H\u030311 = H11 + \u03bb4 . One easily computes\nthe commutators [D, J\u00b1 ] = \u00b1J\u00b1 and [J+ , J\u2212 ] = \u22122D, showing that {D, J+ , J\u2212 }\nform a basis for the Lie algebra SO(2, 1) in the degenerate Bargmann's discrete\nn\nseries representation D+\n, (n = 0),characterized by a vanishing Casimir operator.\nHence the generator Jx has a continuous spectrum filling the whole real axis [12].\nPrevious results about the spectrum can be re\u2013derived as follows: if \u03b1 > \u03b2, one\nwrites\n\u03b1\n1\np\nH\u0303 = cosh y D + sinh y Jx , cosh y = p\n2\n2\n2\n\u03b1 \u2212\u03b2\n\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b22\nand a unitary operator U (a boost) exists such that U \u221a 21 2 H\u0303 U \u22121 = D and the\n\u03b1 \u2212\u03b2\np\n2\n2\nspectrum of H\u0303 is simply En = n \u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2 .\nIf \u03b1 < \u03b2, upon writing\n1\n\u03b2\np\nH\u0303 = sinh y D + cosh y Jx , cosh y = p\n2\n2\n2\n\u03b2 \u2212\u03b1\n\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b12\na unitary operator boosting H\u0303 to Jx exists, hence H\u0303 has a continuous spectrum. On\nthe border \u03b1 = \u03b2, H\u0303 coincides with a light\u2013cone generator which has a continuous\n(positive) spectrum [12].\nFinally the spectrum of the asymptotic Hamiltonian H(\u03bb3 , \u03bb4 ) may be computed\nfrom the spectrum of H\u0303 by the method outlined in the appendix of [8], based on\nan exact perturbation formula (rank\u2013one perturbation).\nNotice that the operators closing the SO(2, 1) algebra represent the restriction\nto the single\u2013trace states of \u0001more\n\u221a general operators acting on general singlet states.\nFor instance J+ \u2192 tr a\u20202 a / N . The operators (H, J+ , J\u2212 ) close a Lie algebra\nup to terms of order 1/N , hence the spectra can be discussed as arising from a\ndynamical symmetry breaking.\nLet us summarize our conclusions :\n\u2022 Hamiltonian models where each operator has the form Tr [(a\u2020 )n am ] with\nn \u2265 1 and m \u2265 1 leave each sector of k-trace states invariant in the large-N\nlimit. By representing the hamiltonian in the basis of single-trace states,\none obtains a real symmetric fixed-width band matrix. The eigenvalue\nequation is a system of recurrent equations which usually allows analytic\nsolution. Still multi-trace singlet sectors are not irrelevant because the mass\nof bound states in these sectors is similar to that of the single-trace states.\nAs indicated in [8] the V-W bosonic hamiltonian may be evaluated in each\nsector obtaining the same eigenvalues, therefore changing (in infinite way)\nthe degeneracy of eigenvalues found in the single-trace analysis.\n\u2022 In the simple models in D = 1 supersymmetry is not necessary for the asymptotic decoupling of the single-trace sector nor for the exact asymptotic\nsolution of the model. However the duality property of the spectrum has a\nstriking simple form only on the susy line \u03bb3 = \u03bb4 .\n\n\f6\n\n\u2022 Light-front quantization seems relevant for realistic models, that is in spacetime dimension 1 < D \u2264 4, because it makes possible to represent a local\nHamiltonian in a partial normally ordered form [13] such that the singletrace sector of Fock space may be asymptotically invariant. This is a practical necessity for the Tamm-Dancoff approach. Exact or approximate algebras of the operators which occur in the asymptotic Hamiltonian provide\na precious tool for the understanding of the spectrum.\n\u2022 When considering a local quantum mechanical hamiltonian H = Tr[p2 +\nx2 + V (x)] in the large-N limit, the Fock space methods seems inappropriate: one cannot avoid operator terms that couple the single-trace states to\nmultiple-trace states in leading order. This makes any evaluation restricted\nto the single-trace Fock states totally unreliable [8][10].\n\u2022 At large N a new dynamical symmetry shows up, simplifying the calculation\nof the spectrum. The interplay of this symmetry with supersymmetry as\nin V\u2013W model deserves further study.\nWe add a last comment to indicate that the bosonic two-couplings model discussed in this letter is the asymptotic generic form of infinitely many Hamiltonians.\nLet us consider the operators Aj , A\u2020j , Dj , j = 1, 2, * * *\nA\u2020j =\nDj =\n\n1\n\nN j\u22121/2\n1\nN j\u22121\n\n\u0001\ntr a\u2020 (a\u2020 a)j , Aj =\n\ntr (a\u2020 a)j\n\n1\n\nN j\u22121/2\n\n\u0001\ntr (a\u2020 a)j a ,\n\n\u0001\n\nIt is easy to verify that asymptotically they leave the sector of the single-trace states\ninvariant\np\nAj n \u223c n(n \u2212 1) n \u2212 1 + O(1/N ) ,\np\nA\u2020j n \u223c n(n + 1) n + 1 + O(1/N ) ,\nDj n \u223c n n + O(1/N )\n\nThen all the Hamiltonians\n\u0010\n\u0011 X\n\u0001 X\nH = tr a\u2020 a +\ngj,3 tr A\u2020j + Aj +\ngj,4 tr (Dj )\nj\u22651\n\nj\u22652\n\nasymptotically leave the sector of the single-trace states invariant and in this sector\nare all represented\u221aby the tridiagonal real symmetric infinite matrix H(\u03bb3 , \u03bb4 ) in\nP\nP\neq.(4) with \u03bb3 = N j gj,3 and \u03bb4 = N j gj,4 .
