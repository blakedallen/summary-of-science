Introduction\nKramers-Kronig transform (KKT) of the reflectance measurements remains a unique\nmethod to determine the dielectric constant of materials, mainly in the short wavelength\ndomain (uv and soft x-ray ranges) [1] where other techniques such as ellipsometry are\ninadequate. In a large number of the early works [2], the KKT was implemented with a\nformulation in which the phase at an arbitrary frequency \u03c90/2\u03c0 is directly proportional to an\nintegral with a logarithmic kernel over the entire spectrum :\n! (\" 0 ) = #\n\n+* Ln & % (\" ) (\n2 \"0\n'\n) d\"\nP+\n2\n2\n0\n$\n\" # \"0\n\n(1)\n\nIt is the Robinson-Price formula [3], where ! and ! (assumed to be even) are the phase and\nthe amplitude of the complex coefficient of reflection r , respectively and P stands for the\nprincipal-value.\nNevertheless it has been emphasized that it should be necessary to add to this integral\na constant term, both in the context of the scattering theory [4,5] and in studies of the\nfoundations of the dispersion relations, in particular by Toll [6]. Stern in a work based on\nToll's analysis attempted to justify the KKT [7]. Young [8] discussed the KKT as given by\nToll and Stern on the basis of physical considerations and concluded that the validity of the\nKKT remains in doubt and must be applied with caution. More recently Nash et al. [9] have\nderived what they called the \u00ab correct version \u00bb of the KKT for the phase spectrum with a\nlogarithmic kernel and give :\n! (\" 0 ) = ! ( 0 ) #\n\n+* Ln & % (\" ) (\n2 \"0\n'\n) d\"\nP+\n0\n$\n\" 2 # \" 02\n\n(2)\n\nUsing integration by parts, Eq. (2) can be slightly rewritten as follows :\n! (\" 0 ) = ! ( 0 ) #\n\n+* dLn & % (\" ) (\n1\n'\n) Ln \" + \" 0 d\"\nP+\n$ 0\nd\"\n\" # \"0\n\n(3)\n\nFrom the mathematical point of view, the term !(0) arises from the existence of a pole at\nzero frequency in the kernel that is overlooked in other approachs. Nash et al. [9] emphasized\nthat the term !(0) is close to -\u03c0 for many materials, but not always, in particular for a\nmaterial whose absorption coefficient does not vanish at zero frequency. Smith [10] derived a\nformula similar to Eq.(2) but proposed to eliminate the additional term !(0) for conductors\nand insulators. Lee et al. [11] have calculated the term !(0) assuming that the dielectric\n\n2\n\n\fconstant is given by the plasma model, i.e. the undamped Drude model, for the case of normal\nincidence using Eq. (3).\nOtherwise it has been recognized that other terms, sometimes called Blashke factors,\nmust be added; they correspond to the occurrence of singularities in the complex coefficient\nof reflection r along the imaginary frequency axis [12]. This complementary Blashke term\nhas been formally expressed for any incidence as well as for the s- and p-polarization [13].\nFor some cases, Generally, the exact value of this term requires the knowledge of the\nbehaviour of the dielectric constant along the imaginary frequency axis.\nThus, although KKT from reflectance measurements has been applied since many\nyears to find the complex refractive index of materials, it seems that it remains some\nconfusion on the formulation for this analysis. To the mere Robinson-Price formula usually\nimplemented, it should be necessary to add some terms (zero-frequency phase term, Blashke\nfactors) whose value depends on the behaviour of the dielectric constant and on the conditions\nof the measurements (oblique or normal incidence, polarization of the incident radiation,\nnature of the mirror: bulk, multilayer, ...). This work is a tentative to clarify this problem for\nany case of incidence in the framework of the Drude model; we only assume transverse\nelectric polarization. We propose to treat the transverse magnetic in a forthcoming paper.\nIn the UV and soft x-ray domains, most of reflectance measurements are performed at\noblique incidence for practical reasons [1] and consequently, an extension to the oblique\nincidence case of the works by Nash et al. [9] and Lee et al. [11] that were restricted to the\nnormal incidence case, was needed. Thus we have been led to develop a reformulated KKT\nbased on the assumption of the undamped Drude model for the dielectric constant.\nTo test the validity of our reformulation, we present a comparison of the values of the\ncomplex refractive index of a gold film deduced from our KKT analysis based on our own\nreflectance measurements (conditions of which are well mastered) with data from literature.\nThe choice of the gold sample has been motivated by the fact that it is recognized that the\ntabulated values of the dielectric constant of this material obtained from methods different\nfrom KKT analysis by reflection are well established.\nInitially this work has been motivated by the fact that the knowledge of accurate\nvalues of the dielectric constants in the short wavelength domain becomes very important for\nthe development of new multilayer optics designed for this spectral domain [14] and for the\ncharacterization of new materials for microelectronics [15].\nThe paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we present a formulation of the KKT\nextended to the oblique case involving the phase at zero frequency and a Blashke factor. The\n3\n\n\fphase at zero frequency is calculated within the Drude model in section 3, while the Blashke\nfactor is determined in section 4. The final expression of the global phase in the Drude model\nis given in section 5. We explain in section 6 our method to deduce the complex refractive\nindex. Section 7 is devoted to the presentation of our reflectance measurements of a gold film.\nIn section 8 we present and discuss the results of the determination of the gold optical index\nfrom our measurement by means of our KKT analysis.\n2. KKT formulation in normal and oblique case with the Drude model\nIt is well-known that from the mathematical point of view, the KKT can be regarded\nas a Hilbert transform that relates the real and imaginary part of a linear response function by\nvirtue of the causality principle. The calculation of this Hilbert transform is performed by a\ncontour integration on a judiciously chosen path C in the complex frequency z plane with an\nappropriate kernel. The choice of the kernel and the determination of the contour C are\nstrongly related. The strategy is to integrate a function that is analytic within the contour and\non the contour C so that, by virtue of the Cauchy theorem, the contour integral vanishes. The\npath along the real axis must lead to a principal-value integral with a logarithmic kernel\ncontaining the modulus of the reflection coefficient and to the phase of reflection at the\nfrequency \u03c90 of interest. These considerations lead to consider a kernel containing the term\n\nLn[r(z)]\n. Consequently, in the usual KKT analysis the dispersion relationship is derived from\nz !\"0\nthe contour integral :\n\n!#\n\nLn[r(z)]\ndz\nz !\"0\n\n(4)\n\nwhere the closed contour includes a complete semi-circle in the upper half-plane (UHP). To\ntake into account the simple pole at \u03c9 = 0, Nash et al. [9] used the kernel g(z) Ln[r(z)] with\ng(z) = z-1 (z - \u03c90)-1 and an integration path C1 (see Appendix) that consists of a complete semicircle in the UHP and of small circles around the 0 and \u03c90 poles along the real axis; thus they\nderivate Eq. (2). Nevertheless Ln[r(z)] may have singularities on the imaginary axis as\ndiscussed in [12] which compromise the analyticity of the kernel within the path C1. These\nsingularities appear along the imaginary frequency axis and have been given by Plaskett et al.\n[12] for the case where the reflection coefficient is given by the Fresnel formula. Taking into\naccount all these considerations, it appears that the kernel f(z) Ln[r(z)] with f(z) = (z2 - \u03c902)-1 is\nanalytic in the first quadrant of the UHP but has a pole at z = \u03c90 on the real frequency axis and\n\n4\n\n\fpossibly three poles on the imaginary frequency axis, commonly named \u03c4, \u03b7 and \u03b4 if the\ncoefficient of reflection is assumed to be given by Fresnel formula.\nAssuming that the radiation is specularly reflected in the s-polarization case\n(transverse electric) at a glancing angle \u03b8, the corresponding Fresnel coefficient of reflection\nis :\n\nrs =\n\n! sin \" + # ! cos 2 \"\n\n(5)\n\nsin \" + # ! cos 2 \"\n\nThe first singularity \u03c4 called pseudo total reflection frequency corresponds to the branch cut of\nthe square root in the Fresnel formula Eq. (5) and satisfies :\n\n! ( i \" ) = cos 2 #\n\n(6)\n\nThe second one \u03b7 called pseudo zero total frequency corresponds to a divergence of the\nlogarithm and fulfills :\n\n! (i \" ) = 1\n\n(7)\n\nThe third one \u03b4 called pseudo total polarization frequency corresponds to Brewster's\ncondition for complete polarisation and satisfies :\n\n! ( i \" ) = cot an 2#\n\n(8)\n\nTo take into account these singularities one has to consider the closed contour C2 (see\nAppendix). The calculation detailed in Appendix gives for the overall phase the following\nrelationship:\n\n!(\" 0 ,# ) = !(0,# ) + K(\" 0 ,# ) + B(\" 0 ,# )\n\n(9)\n\nThe first term comes from the pole at \u03c9 = 0 when one considers the kernel g(z) Ln[r(z)] and\nthe path C1 and does not occur with the kernel f(z) Ln[r(z)] and the path C2; the second term\nK(\u03c90,\u03b8) is a principal-value integral resulting from the integration along the real axis for both\nkernels and paths and is given by :\nK (! 0 , \" ) = #\n\n+* Ln & % (! ) (\n2 !0\n'\n) d! = # 1 P +* dLn &' % (! ) () Ln ! + ! 0 d!\nP+\n0\n$\n! 2 # ! 02\n$ +0\nd!\n! # !0\n\n(10)\n\nEq. (10) is nothing else but the Robinson-Price formula. The third term is the the so-called\nBlashke factor arising from the integration along the imaginary axis for the kernel\nf(z) Ln[r(z)] and the path C2 ; it does not exist for the kernel g(z) Ln[r(z)] and the path C1. This\nterm reads:\nB(! 0 ,\" ) = #\n\n2! 0\n$\n\n+&\n\n5\n\n'\n0\n\nIm ( Ln[ % ( i ! )])\n\n! 2 + ! 02\n\nd!\n\n(11)\n\n\f3. Phase !(0,\") at origin\nIn the Drude model, the dielectric constant is given by :\n\n!

For gold \u03c9p is about 9 eV\n(1.37 1016 rad/s) and ! is around 35 meV (5 1013 rad/s). The continuation of \u03b5(\u03c9) in the UHP\n( ! \" z = ! '+ i ! \" ) is analytic ; \u03b5 takes real values only on the imaginary axis where it\ndecreases from ! at \u03c9'' = i 0 to 1 at \u03c9'' = i ! , as it can be seen from the following formula :\n\n!

(5). To determine the Blashke factor, one has to calculate the integral given by\nEq. (11). To do it this is valuable to note that in our case the singularity \u03c4 disappears at\ninfinity since cos2 ! 1 while the pole \u03b4 vanishes and \u03b7 tends towards infinity; indeed along the\nimaginary axis the dielectric constant tends to unity as the frequency goes to infinity as\nmentioned above which means that ! \" # . It follows that the term Im(Log[r(i\u03c9'']) in the\nintegrand is equal to \u03c0 on the imaginary positive axis and the integral becomes:\nB(! 0 ,\" ) = #\n\n2! 0\n$\n\n+%\n\n$\n2! 0 $ 2\nd\n!\n=\n#\n= #$\n&0 ! 2 + ! 02\n$ 2! 0\n\n(20)\n\nIt appears that the Blashke factor contributes to the global phase by the term \u2013 \u03c0 in the Drude\nmodel, in agreement with the data given in [13], case 3.1 of the Table 1.\n5. The global phase in the Drude model\nBy virtue of Eq. (9), the global phase in the Drude model reads:\n\n! Drude (\" 0 ,# ) = ! Drude (0,# ) + K Drude (\" 0 ,# ) + BDrude (\" 0 ,# )\n\n(21)\n\nTaking into account the preceding results, it follows that !Drude (\" 0 ,#) is given for the spolarization reflection by :\n! Drude (\" 0 ,# ) = $\n\n/\n\" min dLn ' & Drude (\" ) )\n1 , \" max dLn '( & (\" ) )*\n\" + \"0\n1 , +2\n(\n* Ln \" + \" 0 d\" / $ %\nP+\nLn\nd\" 1 $ .

(14) that \u03c1(\u03c9) varies as \u03c9-2 so that:\n+#\ndLn[! Drude (\")]\n\" + \"0\n2\n\" + \"0\nLn\nd\"\n=\n%P\nLn\nd\"\n$\n$\nd\"\n\" % \"0\n\" % \"0\n\" max\n\" max \"\n+#\n\nP\n\n(23)\n\nIn the low energy range the following extrapolation is adopted:\n1/ 2\n$\n\" '\n!(\") = !

The phase at zero frequency does\nnot contribute in our model. According to Eq. (5) the global phase could be obtained by the\nsum of only three terms; nevertheless other terms may be added. The term m ! sgn(\" ) with\n\nsgn(! ) =\n\n!\nfor \u03c9 \u2260 0 must be added to take into account that the direction of beam\n!\n\npropagation is arbitrary and the reflectivity tensor can be multiplied by -1 without affecting\nthe physical situation. Of course, one may add an integer multiple of 2. Finally, let us\nemphasize that other terms should be introduced if the kernel presents at some frequencies a\n\"pathological\" behaviour compromising its analyticy in the UHP but this situation is beyond\nthe scope of the paper since we restrict to the case where the coefficient of reflection is given\nby the Fresnel formula and the incident medium is vacuum.\n5. Method of determination of the dielectric constant by the KKT in the Drude model\nFrom the reflectance measurements, we deduce the experimental amplitude of the\nreflection coefficient that is then introduced in the integrand of the first integral of Eq. (22).\nOne deduces an experimental coefficient of reflection:\nr (! ,\" ) = #exp (! ,\" ) exp ( i $ (! ,\" )\n\n)\n\n(25)\n\nIt is well-known that the surface roughness tends to decrease the specular reflectance of a\nmirror and this phenomenon must be taken into account. Although very sophisticated theories\nhave been developed to model the light scattering by a surface roughness, we restrict\n\n8\n\n\fourselves to the so-called Debye-Waller (DW) model [16]. Let us recall that in this model the\ncoefficient of reflection is decreased by the DW factor :\n&\n)\n\"2\nDW = exp ( ! 4 2 sin 2 $ % 2 +\n#\n'\n*\n\n(26)\n\nwhere \u03bb is the radiation wavelength in the mirror medium and \u03c3 the rms height of the\nroughness.\nTo obtain the dielectric constant from the measurements we have implemented three\nmethods :\n-i/ the comparison of the theoretical coefficient rF (! ,\" , # r , # i ) calculated by means of\nthe Fresnel formula multiplied by the Debye-Waller term DW(\u03b8,\u03c9) taking into account the\nsurface roughness of the sample with the experimental coefficient by solving the following\nsystem of two equations :\n\nRe[r (! ,\" )] = DW (! ,\" ) Re[rF (! ,\" , # r , # i )]\nIm[r (! ,\" )] = DW (! ,\" ) Im[rF (! ,\" , # r , # i )]\n\n(27)\n\nunknows of which are the real part \u03b5r and the imaginary part \u03b5i of the dielectric constant. The\nFindRoot function of Mathematica\u00ae was used to carry out this operation.\n-ii/ the direct calculation of the real part \u03b5r and of the imaginary part \u03b5i of the dielectric\nconstant from the experimental amplitude \u03c1 = ! exp (\",#) corrected by the DW term and the\nphase !Drude (\",#) resulting from the KKT in the Drude model, by means of the relationships :\n\n(\n\n)\n(1 + # + 2 # cos % )\n4 \" sin # sin $ ( \" % 1)\n=\n(1 + \" + 2 \" cos $ )\n\n!r = 1 \"\n\n2\n\n2\n\n!i\n\n(\n\n4 # sin 2 $ cos % 1 + # 2 + 2 #\n2\n\n)\n\n(28)\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n(29)\n\n-iii/ the direct calculation of the complex dielectric constant from the experimental\namplitude \u03c1 = !exp (\" ,# ) corrected by the DW term and from the phase !

Measurements of the reflectance of the gold mirror\nThe Au film was deposited using magnetron sputtering onto a Si3N4/Si substrate. The\npurity of the Au target is 99.95%. The thickness of the Au film is about 60 nm. Before the\nmeasurement the sample was cleaned by a soft Ar sputtering in the following conditions:\n1 keV ion energy, sample orientation equal to 45\u00b0, base pressure around 2.10-7 mbar, duration\n30 min. The contamination of the Au film was checked in situ by means of x-ray\nphotoelectron spectroscopy and did not show C or O presence within the experimental error.\nThe reflectance of the mirror was measured at the BEAR beam-line of ELETTRA\nsynchrotron facility for s-polarization light. The surface of the sample was investigated with a\nZYGO interferometer [17]. According to the location on the sample, the rms height of the\nsurface \u03c3 is between 1 and 5 nm. For the DW calculation we have retained the mean value of\n1.5 nm.\nFigure 1 shows the reflectance of the gold mirror for different glancing angles \u03b8: 5\u00b0,\n10\u00b0, 30\u00b0 50\u00b0 and 70\u00b0. Around 290eV and for large glancing angles, it is possible to note a\nsignature of a carbon contamination of the sample; this contamination was not detected by\nXPS measurements and can be ascribed probably to buried carbon, maybe at the interface\nwith the substrate: the carbon peaks are not visible at low glancing angles that is when the\nlight doesn't reach the substrate. For \u03b8 = 50\u00b0 and 70\u00b0, Kiessig fringes can be observed. It\nappears that the measurements at \u03b8 = 30\u00b0 are well suited for the determination of the optical\nindex because interferences with the substrate (Kiessig fringes) are not too strong and the\npenetration of the radiation in the sample is enough to probe the bulk of the Au film, which is\nnot the case for the smallest glancing angles at energies smaller than 200 eV.\n\n10\n\n\fFigure 1 : Measured reflectance of the gold mirror for different glancing angles \u03b8 : 5\u00b0, 10\u00b0,\n30\u00b0 50\u00b0 and 70\u00b0 in the s-polarization case.\n7. Complex optical index of gold between 40 and 350 eV from KKT\nThe real part n and imaginary part \u03b2 of the complex refractive index of our gold film\nhave been determined as explained in section 5 from the measurements performed at \u03b8 = 30\u00b0.\nThe three methods give the same results. Figure 2 presents the values of n and \u03b2 between 40\nand 350 eV. The effect of anomalous dispersion associated with the 5p and 4f electrons of\ngold can be observed around 60 and 85 eV respectively, as shown in Figure 2.\n1.00\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.95\n\n0.2\n0.90\n\nn\n\n!\n0.1\n0.85\n0.1\n0.80\n50\n\n100\n150\n200\n250\n300\nIncident photon energy (eV)\n\n0.0\n\nFigure 2: Real part n (red line) and imaginary part \u03b2 (blue line) of the refractive index of our\ngold film from the measurements performed at \u03b8 = 30\u00b0 calculated by our reformulated KKT.\n\n11\n\n\fThe values obtained with our KKT can be compared to the tabulated values [18], see\nfigure 3a for the real part n and figure 3b for the imaginary part \u03b2 . The agreement is rather\nsatisfactory but it is difficult to draw conclusions from this comparison about the quality of\nthe data because the methods of determination and the samples are rather different.\nNevertheless one can say that our reformulated KKT with accurate measurements of\nreflectance and careful characterization of the surface in terms of roughness provides fairly\ncorrect values of the complex refractive index.\n1.00\n\n0.95\n\nn\n\n0.90\n\n0.85\n\n0.80\n\n(a)\n50\n\n100\n\n150 200 250 300 350\nIncident photon energy (eV)\n\n400\n\n(b)\n\n0.30\n0.25\n\n!\n\n0.20\n0.15\n0.10\n0.05\n0.00\n\n50\n\n100\n\n150 200 250 300 350\nIncident photon energy (eV)\n\n400\n\nFigure 3: Real part n (a) and imaginary part \u03b2 (b) of the refractive index of our gold film from\nthe measurements performed at \u03b8 = 30\u00b0, calculated by our reformulated KKT (blue line)\ncompared to the tabulated values (red line).\n8. Conclusion and perspectives\n\n12\n\n\fThe approach proposed by Nash et al. [9] and Lee et al. [11] has been extended to the\noblique case and to the Drude model -including the damping term- of the dielectric constant.\nIn this framework we have calculated the additional term !(0,\") and the Blashke factor and\nfinally deduced a reformulated KKT. To take into account the singularities on the imaginary\nfrequency axis we have implemented a contour integration to perform the Hilbert transform\ndifferent from the one chosen by Nash et al. [9] and we get a formulation of the KKT that is\nslightly different. It appears that in our approach the contribution to the global phase of the\nterm !(0,\") cancels and that the Blashke term B(\u03c90) contributes by the value - \u03c0.\nComparison of the results obtained for the complex refractive index of our gold\nsample by means our reformulated KKT with tabulated data leads to believe that our approach\nis a rather satisfactory method to determine the unknown refractive index values of newly\nelaborated substances provided that the reflecting surface is well characterized. It would be\nvaluable to check this conclusion for other materials, especially semiconductors and\ninsulators, the refractive indices of which are available in the literature. The case of ppolarization (transverse magnetic) especially concerning the influence of the Blashke factor in\nthe Brewster condition will be considered in a forthcoming paper.\nAcknowledgments : The authors wish to thank Prs.
