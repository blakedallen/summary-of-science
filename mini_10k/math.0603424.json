In this paper we consider the Euler\u2013Lagrange minimal surface equation\n\b\nEmin\u03a3 = (1 + u2y ) uxx \u2212 2ux uy uxy + (1 + u2x ) uyy = 0\n(1)\n3\nwhose solutions describe two-dimensional minimal surfaces \u03a3 \u2282 E in nonparametric\nform \u03a3 = {z = u(x, y)}, here x, y, z are the Cartesian coordinates. We construct two\ninfinite sequences of the minimal surfaces related to nonpolynomial contact symmetries\nof Eq. (1).\nRemark 1. Although the graphs of solutions for Eq. (1) determine the minimal surfaces\nonly locally such that the projections of their tangent planes to 0xy are nondegenerate,\nthis is not restrictive for our reasonings. The minimal surfaces constructed in section 2\nare self-intersecting, being in fact described by multi-valued solutions of Eq. (1) and\nadmitting singular points.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In section 1 we describe the generators and the\ncommutator relations of the contact symmetry algebra for Emin\u03a3 . We provide examples of the contact non-point generators and indicate the recursion operators for the\ncommutative Lie subalgebra of sym Emin\u03a3 . In section 2 we show that any surface which\nis invariant w.r.t. a contact non-point symmetry flow is always a plane, although nonplanar minimal surfaces in space are assigned to the same symmetry generators by\nthe inverse Legendre transformation. Thus we construct two sequences of the minimal surfaces associated with nonpolynomial contact symmetries of Emin\u03a3 ; one of the\nsequences starts with the helicoid [4] in E3 .

In particular, we obtain explicit formulas for\nthe self-intersecting minimal surface \u03a36 that fills the trefoil knot; this surface succeeds\nthe helicoid \u03a35 with respect to the recursion relations.\nRemark 2. The very idea to construct an infinite sequence of minimal surfaces with no\nrestrictions upon the boundary conditions can be easily fulfilled by using the Ennepert\u2013\nWeierstrass representation [4] that assigns the surfaces to arbitrary complex-analytic\nfunctions. The objective of this note is that the geometry of Eq. (1) suggests a natural\ndiscrete proliferation scheme based on the symmetry approach.\nThe resulting surfaces contained in Appendix A seem to be relevant in Natural\nsciences (hydromechanics, bionics, or chemistry); strangely, these particular solutions\ngiven in parametric representation are not met in classical textbooks and reviews on\nthe topic [4, 6].\n1. Contact symmetries of the minimal surface equation\nThe Ennepert\u2013Weierstrass representation [4] yields that the symmetry group of the\nminimal surface equation is the conformal group, which is a semi-direct product of\nthe M\u00f6bius group and the component that corresponds to complex-analytic functions\n(also, the full symmetry group incorporates the dilatation). The M\u00f6bius subgroup\ncorresponds to the group of rotations of E3 owing to the isomorphism sl(2) \u2243 so(3).\nIn this section we interpret the above assertion in view of the Legendre transformation\nthat brings Eq. (1) to linear form.\nLet us recall that equation (1) is mapped to the linear elliptic equation\n\b\nL(Emin\u03a3 ) = (1 + p2 ) \u03c6pp + 2pq \u03c6pq + (1 + q 2 ) \u03c6qq = 0\n(2)\nby the Legendre transformation\nL = {\u03c6 = xux + yuy \u2212 u, p = ux , q = uy }.\nThe inverse Legendre transformation L\u22121 = {x = \u03c6p , y = \u03c6q , u = p\u03c6p +q\u03c6q \u2212\u03c6} assigns\nthe minimal surfaces \u03a3 in parametric form to solutions of Eq. (2).\nEach symmetry of Eq. (2) corresponds to a symmetry transformation of Eq. (1).\nRecall that the determining relation L\u03c6 (F ) = 0 on E = {F = 0} for the infinitesimal\nsymmetries \u03c6 of any linear differential equation E coincides with the equation itself,\nhere L\u03c6 is the evolutionary vector field with the generator \u03c6 (see [5]). Therefore it is\nquite natural that the symmetry algebra of Eq. (1) incorporates the set of solutions\n\u03c6(ux , uy ) = \u03c6(p, q)\n\n(3)\n\nof the linear equation (2). Hence follows the description of contact symmetry algebra\nfor the minimal surface equation (1).\nProposition 1. The Lie algebra sym Emin\u03a3 of contact symmetries of the minimal surface equation (1) is generated by solutions \u03c6(ux , uy ) of Eq. (2), in particular, by\nthe shift \u03c61 = 1 and the translations \u03c6i2 = uxi along x1 \u2261 x and x2 \u2261 y, by the\ni\ni\nrotations \u03c612\n3 = yux \u2212 xuy and \u03c63 = x + uuxi , here i = 1, 2, and by the dilatation \u03c64 = u \u2212 xux \u2212 yuy .\n\n\fMINIMAL SURFACES ASSIGNED TO CONTACT SYMMETRIES\n\n3\n\nExample 1. In [3] two infinite sequences of the symmetry generators \u03c6(ux , uy ) for the\nminimal surface equation were constructed. It was postulated that the functions \u03c6 are\npolynomial in uy ; then for each degree k \u2265 0 of the polynomials there are two solutions.\nThe initial terms of these sequences are\n\u03c61 = 1,\n\n\u03c612 = ux ,\n\n\u03c622 = uy ,\n\nux u2y\n+ arctan ux ,\n1 + u2x\nux u3y\n3 ux uy\n,\n+\n*\n\u03c68 =\n(1 + u2x )2 2 1 + u2x\n\u03c66 =\n\n\u03c65 = uy arctan ux ,\n\n\u03c67 =\n\nu2y\n\u2212 ux arctan ux ,\n1 + u2x\n\n\u03c69 =\n\nu2x \u2212 1\n3uy\n3\n.\n*\nu\n\u2212\ny\n(1 + u2x )2\n1 + u2x\n\nThe generators \u03c6k depend rationally on ux for all k \u2265 8. We conjecture that none of\nthe contact symmetries \u03c6k is Noether whenever k \u2265 5.\nThe identification (3) yields that a sequence of solutions \u03c6(p, q) is obtained whenever\na recursion for the contact non-point symmetries \u03c6(ux , uy ) of Eq. (1) is known. We claim\nthat three local recursion operators for this component of sym Emin\u03a3 are determined by\nthe adjoint representation of the symmetry algebra itself. Now we study these aspects\nin more detail.\nThe commutation relations for the seven point symmetries \u03c61 , . . ., \u03c64 , see Proposition 1, were derived in [1]. Let us indicate the commutation properties of the contact\nsymmetries that originate from Eq. (2).\nLemma 2. Assume that \u03c6\u2032 (ux , uy ) and \u03c6\u2032\u2032 (ux , uy ) are the generators of evolutionary\nvector fields L\u03c6\u2032 and L\u03c6\u2032\u2032 . Then their Jacobi bracket {\u03c6\u2032 , \u03c6\u2032\u2032 } is always trivial.\nProposition 3. All contact symmetries \u03c6(ux , uy ) \u2208 sym Emin\u03a3 of the minimal surface\nequation Emin\u03a3 commute. Also, the following relations hold :\n{\u03c612\n3 , \u03c6} = ux\n\n\u2202\u03c6\n\u2202\u03c6\n\u2212 uy\n,\n\u2202uy\n\u2202ux\n\n{\u03c64 , \u03c6} = \u2212\u03c6,\n\n{\u03c6i3 , \u03c6} = \u2212uxi \u03c6 + (1 + u2xi )\n\n\u2202\u03c6\n\u2202\u03c6\n+ ux uy\n.\n\u2202uxi\n\u2202ux3\u2212i\n\nThe Lie subalgebra h generated by the solutions \u03c6(ux , uy ) of Eq. (2) is the radical of\nthe contact symmetry algebra sym Emin\u03a3 for Eq. (1).\nand ad\u03c6i3 : h \u2192 h define the local recursion operators\nCorollary 4.

KISELEV\n\nTwo infinite sequences of the contact symmetries are obtained [3] from \u03c66 and \u03c67 by\nmultiple application of the recursion ad\u03c612\n. From the above diagram it follows that the\n3\nsymmetry \u03c65 is the 'seed' generator for both sequences.\n2. The minimal surfaces associated with the contact symmetries\nContinuing the line of reasonings, we see that any contact symmetry \u03c6(ux , uy ) \u2208 h\nof Eq. (1) determines the minimal surfaces \u03a3 using two different methods:\n(1) Recall that \u03c6(p, q) defined in (3) is a solution of Eq. (2), hence the inverse\nimage L\u22121 (\u03c6) of the graph of \u03c6 with respect to the Legendre transformation is\na minimal surface in parametric representation.\n(2) The symmetry reduction Emin\u03a3 \u2229 {\u03c6 = 0} of Eq. (1) by a generator \u03c6 \u2208 h \u2282\nsym Emin\u03a3 determines the \u03c6-invariant surface in E3 .\nExample 2. Consider the solution \u03c65 = q arctan p of Eq. (2). Using the first method,\nwe obtain the helicoid {z = x tan y} \u2282 E3 whose axis is 0y. The minimal surface which\nis invariant w.r.t. the symmetry \u03c65 = uy arctan ux is a plane. This is a particular case\nof the following general property of the surfaces.\nProposition 5. Suppose that a minimal surface \u03a3 is invariant w.r.t. a contact symmetry \u03c6(ux , uy ). Then \u03a3 is a plane.\nProof. Consider the constraint \u03c6 = 0. By the implicit function theorem, we have\nuy = f (ux ) almost everywhere. Therefore, uyy = (f \u2032 (ux ))2 * uxx and from Eq. (1) we\nobtain the equation\n\u0010\n\u0011\n2\n(1 + u2x ) * (f \u2032 (ux )) \u2212 2ux f (ux ) * f \u2032 (ux ) + (1 + f 2 (ux )) * uxx = 0.\nHence either uxx = 0 and we have ux = const, uy = f (ux ) = const, or ux satisfies the\nalgebraic equation whose solutions are ux = const and therefore uy = f (ux ) = const\nagain.\n\u0003\nIn what follows we focus on the first method for constructing the minimal surfaces,\nthat is, \u03a3 = L\u22121 (\u03c6(p, q)). Using Proposition 3 and Corollary 4, we obtain two sequences\nof solutions \u03c6k (p, q) of Eq. (2), which are polynomial in q and which are nonpolynomial\nin p for k \u2265 5. By Remark 3, both sequences are obtained from the generating section \u03c65 (p, q). First let us list the solutions \u03c610 , \u03c611 and \u03c612 , \u03c613 of Eq. (2), which are\npolynomials in q of degrees 4 and 5, respectively.

The regular minimal\nsurface \u03a37 = L\u22121 (\u03c67 ) resembles a flying bird. The surfaces \u03a38 and \u03a313 are propellerlike. The family \u03a39\u221212 provides the shapes of pearl shells; the origin is a singular point\nfor them, and their self-intersections divide the space E3 in different number of cells for\ndifferent subscripts k. The corresponding pictures are given in Appendix A.\nAcknowledgements. The author thanks A. Klyachko, D. Pelinovskiy, and R. Vitolo\nfor helpful discussions.
