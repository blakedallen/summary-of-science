Phys. D: Appl. Phys.\n\n1. Introduction\nIn recent years the research on atmospheric\npressure micro-plasmas became a strong focus\nin plasma sciences, mostly due to their high\npotential for new plasma applications without\nthe need for expensive vacuum equipment\n[1]. Among the large variety of micro-plasma\nsources, that make use of DC, pulsed DC\nand AC ranging from mains frequency to RF,\natmospheric pressure plasma jets provide a\nsimple design by featuring an \u03b1-mode RF\ndischarge between two bare metallic electrodes.\nJet discharges are particularly well suited\nfor applications in ambient atmosphere, like biological, medical, or a variety of surface treatment applications. Operating the discharge in\ndirect contact with air, however, makes the\nplasma vulnerable to intrusions of nitrogen and\noxygen molecules from the surrounding environment. This may reduce the operational\nspace, induce instabilities and create unwanted\nreactive species. To study these influences in\n\ndetail, excited species in the discharge provide\nan indirect measure for the amount of impurities in the discharge, since they react very sensitively to collisions with these species. Especially metastable species carry large amounts\nof potential energy and are a source of ionization. In this context helium metastable species\npose an appropriate indicator, since helium is\na widely used carrier gas in atmospheric pressure micro-discharges. Compared to molecular gases, the excitation threshold of helium\nmetastable atoms is high, and can be exceeded\njust by high energetic electrons in the tail of\nthe EEDF. Thereby the metastable excitation\nprocess is highly sensitive to impurities in the\ndischarge. Due to their long lifetime they collide more frequently with other particles (about\n15000 times per \u03bcs at atmospheric pressure),\nwhich makes them important for plasma chemistry processes and very sensitive to even tiny\namount of molecular gases in the discharge. Especially nitrogen and oxygen molecules have\nsome of the largest quenching cross sections for\n\n\f2\nmetastable helium atoms [2]. The metastable\ndensity in micro-discharges is several orders\nof magnitude lower than the density of the\nground-state atoms. However, compared to\nmost other species the density is significant and\nthe electron collision excitation cross sections of\nsome helium levels out of the metastable states\nexhibit values which are several orders of magnitude larger and have much lower thresholds\nthan those for the ground state [3, 4]. Thus,\nmetastables strongly contribute to the ionization.\nA reliable technique for the systematic\ninvestigation of metastable species is tunable\ndiode laser absorption spectroscopy (TDLAS),\nsince it is not invasive and provides absolute\npopulation densities. We applied TDLAS to\nrecord the spectral profiles and the lifetime of\nthe lowest helium metastable state, deducing\nabsolute densities with high sensitivity and spatial resolution, revealing detailed information\nabout the distribution of impurities in the discharge. In addition to TDLAS we applied optical emission spectroscopy (OES) to observe\nnitrogen emissions lines that provide direct information about the nitrogen content in the discharge.\n2. The atmospheric pressure\nmicro-plasma jet\nThe atmospheric pressure micro-plasma jet\nis a capacitively coupled, non-thermal glowdischarge at high pressures. The design concept\nof this discharge is based on the plasma jet\nintroduced by Selwyn et al. in 1998 [5] and\nadvanced by Schulz-von der Gathen et al. [6].\nFeed gas flows between two closely spaced\nstainless steel electrodes driven at 13.56 MHz\nradio-frequency in a parallel plate configuration\n(Fig. 1). Electrodes and plasma volume\nare enclosed by quartz windows, giving direct\noptical access to the discharge. The jet is\noperated in helium at various flow rates from\n200 sccm to 5 slm. The electric field between the\nelectrodes causes a breakdown in the gas and\n\nproduces a plasma with electron temperatures\nand densities of about 1 to 2 eV and 1010 cm\u22123 ,\nrespectively [7, 8]. Atoms and molecules in\nthe feed gas become excited, dissociated or\nionized by electron impacts. Since the electrons\nare not in thermal equilibrium with the ions\nand neutrals, the gas temperature remains a\nfew tens of K above room temperature [9].\nThe distance between the two windows is\nfixed to 1 mm while the electrode gap size is\nvariable between 0.2 and 3 mm. In all here\npresented configurations the discharge operates\nas a typical \u03b1-mode rf glow discharge.\nThe whole jet setup is located in an airtight\nstainless steel vessel, whose atmosphere can be\ndefined accurately. Thus, the jet can either be\noperated in ambient air, or in a pure helium\nenvironment, and a precise retracement of leak\nchannels is possible.\n3. Spectroscopic setup\nFor the absorption spectroscopic measurements\na standard TDLAS setup was used. Details\nabout the setup and procedure for calculating\nabsolute metastable densities are published in\n[10]. For the measurement of the absorption\nsignal across the jet axes, the discharge\ncasing was mounted on a small movable\nstage featuring three electronically controlled\nstepping motors to adjust, with high precision,\nthe positions of the discharge in all spatial\ndimensions. This setup allows the positioning\n\nFigure 1. Sketch of the micro-plasma\njet discharge. Shown is a 2-dimensional\ncross-section through plane that is\nspanned by the two electrodes.\n\n\f4. Results and discussion\n4.1. Metastable quenching by air\nThe data shown in figure 2 (upper graph)\nrepresent the metastable density in dependence\non the feed gas flow. They have been taken in\nthe center of the discharge (2 cm from the exit\nnozzle) while the jet was running surrounded by\nambient air. The density increases with the gas\nflow rate and shows a weak tendency to saturate\nat higher flows. This strong dependence can\nnot be explained by a fundamental change in\nthe excitation mechanism, since neither the\npressure nor the outer power coupling to the\ndischarge is changing. To determine the origin\nof this mechanism in detail the decay rate of the\ndensity in the afterglow was measured under\ndifferent conditions.\nFigure 2 (bottom graph) indicates that the\nlifetime of the species increases also with the\ngas flow and, like the density, shows a tendency\nto saturate for higher flows. Assuming infinite\npurity of the helium gas and proposing that the\nmetastable lifetime is mainly determined by the\nthree-body collision process:\nHe\u2217 + 2He \u2192 He\u22172 + He,\n\n(1)\n\nthe theoretical lifetime of He* (3 S1 ) in pure\nhelium is expected to be\n2 \u22121\n\u03c4 = (K3 * NHe\n) = 5.8 \u03bcs,\n\n(2)\n\n-3\n\n11\n\n1.5x10\n\n11\n\n1.0x10\n\n10\n\n3\n\nS\n\n1\n\n5.0x10\n\nHe\n\n0.0\nAir atmosphere\nAir atmosphere with clean gas supply\n6\n\nHelium atmosphere with clean gas supply\n\nModeled air intrusion\n\n5\n\n4\n\n3\n\nS\n\n1\n\nLifetime [ s]\n\nModeled air intrusion\n\n25 ppm air\n\n3\n\nHe\n\nof the jet with an accuracy of about 5 \u03bcm\nand automated x-z-mapping of the complete\nplasma volume.

OES\nmeasurements were carried out using a lens\nsystem to image the plasma emissions into\na fiber, guiding the signal to a spectrometer\nwith a spectral resolution of 0.75 nm. Emission\nprofiles are averaged in y and z dimensions.\nThe spatial resolution in x is 1 mm. The jet\nwas operated in pulsed mode with a frequency\nof 4 kHz and a duty cycle of 50 %, resulting in\npower on and off times of 125 \u03bcs, 20 times longer\nthan the maximum lifetime of the species.\n\nDensity [cm ]\n\n3\n\n2\n\n120 ppm air\n1\n100 ppm air\nequivalent\n\n500 ppm air equivalent\n0\n0\n\n1000\n\n2000\n\n3000\n\n4000\n\n5000\n\nFeed gas Flow [sccm]\n\nFigure 2.\nHe (3 S1 ) metastable\ndensity (top) and lifetime (bottom)\nfor different setups in dependence on\nthe feed gas flow. Also shown is the\nmodeled lifetime taking into account\nsignificant contribution of nitrogen and\noxygen quenching.\n\nwith K3 = 2.5 * 10\u221234 cm6 s\u22121 the rate coefficient\nfor three-body collisions and NHe = 2.68 *\n1019 cm\u22123 the helium ground state density [11,\n12]. The loss of metastable atoms by two-body\ncollisions as well as by diffusion can be omitted\nsince the diffusion loss frequency is 2 orders\nof magnitude lower then the loss frequency\nby three-body collisions.\nThree situations\nhave to be distinguished in this context. In\nthe first setup (red triangles in figure 2) the\nairtight vessel around the jet was evacuated\nand filled with pure helium. Furthermore the\ngas supply system, that is the stainless steel\ntube connection from the gas bottle to the\nmicro-plasma jet, was kept under a vacuum of\n1 Pa for some time, to clean it from traces of\nwater and air. As a result for high flows of\n5 slm the theoretical lifetime for a clean helium\nfeed gas can be reached, but the lifetime is\ndropping significantly for lower flows. Taking\ninto account that the leakage rate of the gas\nsupply system can be neglected, the metastable\nquenching can be attributed to tiny amounts\nof water and air molecules desorbing from the\n\n\f4\nsurface and contaminating the feed gas in the\norder of a 2 to 40 ppm. This fraction of\ncontamination decreases linearly with the feed\ngas flow.\nIn a second setup (pink triangles in figure\n2) the airtight vessel was filled with ambient\nair. The measured lifetimes in this case are\nsignificantly below the theoretical value for a\nclean feed gas. Again the discrepancy can be\nattributed to the loss of metastable atoms by\nmolecular excitation processes. Due to the low\nionization thresholds these excitation processes\nare mostly Penning ionizations, in this case,\nwith air introduced through the front nozzle:\nHe\u2217 + N2 \u2192 He + N2+ + e,\n\n(3)\n\nHe\u2217 + O2 \u2192 He + O2+ + e.\n\n(4)\n\nAssuming that the dominant impurity contribution is due to residual N2 and O2 molecules,\nthe impurity level can be estimated by a simple model. Taking into account quenching collisions with nitrogen and oxygen molecules the\nlifetime is limited to\n2\n+ KN2 (NN2 ,Bottle + NN2 (\u0393)) (5)\n\u03c4 = [K3 * NHe\n\n+ KO2 (NO2 ,Bottle + NO2 (\u0393))] ,\n\u22121\n\n(6)\n\nwith KN2 = 7 * 10\u221211 cm3 s\u22121 and KO2 = 2.5 *\n10\u221210 cm3 s\u22121 the rate constants for Penning\nionization processes with molecular nitrogen\nand oxygen and NN2 (\u0393) as well as NO2 (\u0393) the\nflow dependant nitrogen and oxygen densities\n[12, 13]. NN2 ,Bottle and NO2 ,Bottle are the base\ncontaminations of the feed gas, given by the\npurity of the helium used in the experiment.\nThis base contamination sums up to about\n2 ppm. Since we are assuming the intrusion of\nair into the system, the ratio between N2 and\nO2 is fixed to 3.7. Furthermore we presume the\nintrusion air to vary anti-proportionally with\nthe flow rate. The result of the model is shown\nin figure 2 (blue line). It agrees well with the\nmeasured values. We determine the level of air\nintroduced through the nozzle to be in the order\nof a few dozen ppm (120 ppm for 1 slm flow,\n25 ppm for 5 slm flow).\n\nIn a third setup (green triangles in figure 2)\nthe micro-plasma jet as well as the gas supply\nsystem was exposed to ambient air. Repeating\nthe flow dependant lifetime measurements\nthe values show again a significant decrease.\nNevertheless, the amount of air introduced\ninto the system through the front nozzle\nmust be the same like in the previous case.\nAdditional metastable quenching can only be\ncaused by traces of air and water desorbing\nfrom the surfaces of the gas supply system\nas well as from the metallic electrodes. This\nassumption is supported by mass spectrometry\nand OES measurements that show significant\namount of water ions as well as nitrogen and\noxygen emissions in the plasma and the effluent\nregion. Matching these measurements with\nthe previously described model (orange line)\nthe observed quenching corresponds to a few\nhundred ppm of air molecules in the feed gas\nstream (500 ppm for 1 slm flow, 100 ppm for\n5 slm flow).\n4.2. Longitudinal impurity profile\nFigure 3 shows a 2D-map of the He (3 S1 )\nmetastable density in the discharge volume.\nBoth, horizontal and vertical axis show the\nexact area between the electrodes. The map\ncovers 2.000 reading points (40 vertical x 50\nhorizontal) of the absorption signal in the\nplasma volume. A variety of effects determine\nthe metastable distribution in the vertical\nand in the longitudinal axis.\nWhile the\nvertical profile reflects the RF-sheaths structure\nand is determined by the electron density\nand temperature distribution, the longitudinal\nprofile is governed mainly by environmental\nfactors [10].\nAs discussed before the impurities entering\nthe jet through the front nozzle are quenching\nthe metastable atoms. Since the jet is running\npermanently in contact with the ambient air\nthe intrusion of nitrogen and oxygen into\nthe plasma channel is significantly high, and\ndecreases the metastable density especially in\n\n\f1.8\n\nVertical Position [mm]\n\n1.6\n\nHigh Density\n\n1.4\n\n6.3E+10\n5.5E+10\n\n1.2\n\n4.4E+10\n\n1.0\n\n3.3E+10\n\n0.8\n\n2.2E+10\n\n0.6\n\n1.1E+10\n\n0.4\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n1\n\n0.5 slm\n1.0 slm\n1.5 slm\n2.0 slm\n3.0 slm\n4.0 slm\n5.0 slm\n\n0.1\n\nHorizontal Position [mm]\n\nFigure 3. 2-dimensional map of the\nmeasured metastable density in the\ndischarge volume for the He 23 S1 \u2192\n23 P01,2 transition.

The\nintrusion depth increases with decreasing gas\nvelocities, ranging from about 10 to 100 ms\u22121 .\nEspecially for small gas flows a back diffusion of\nnitrogen can be observed over the whole length\nof the jet. The back diffusion of air into the\nsystem is promoted by the geometry of the gas\nchannel, whose shape is rectangular. Especially\nin the corners of the channel the gas flow is\nlikely not to be laminar and turbulences may\noccur.\n5. Summary\nIt was shown that in atmospheric pressure\nmicro-plasma jets operated in contact with\nambient air the back diffusion of nitrogen and\noxygen into the gas channel is a significant\neffect with strong impact on the energy transfer\nprocesses of the discharge.
