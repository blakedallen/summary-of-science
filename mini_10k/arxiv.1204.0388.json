But particles that interact strongly with each\nother, such as ions or spins in a solid, typically also couple\nto their environment rather strongly, so that decoherence\ndegrades the entanglement that is being created through\ninteractions [1, 2]. On the other hand, a weakly or noninteracting particle, such as a photon, is very unlikely to\nget entangled with multiple partners at the same time [3],\nbut does not suffer from rapid decay of entanglement [4].\nTherefore, if we aim to create many-body entanglement that persists over long periods of time, it is imperative to deal with the interplay between interactions and\ndecoherence. Our plan in the present paper is to apply\nthe principles of quantum control in order to optimally\nexploit a system's intrinsic interactions and, at the same\ntime, to reduce the detrimental influence of decoherence.\nMore explicitly, a system that naturally evolves under\na system Hamiltonian Hsys and couples to its environment can be steered with an additional time-dependent\ncontrol Hamiltonian Hc (t), induced, for example, by\nshaped laser pulses. For weak environment coupling, the\nsystem dynamics is described by a master equation in\nLindblad form [5]\no\u0013\nX \u0012\ni\n1n \u2020\n\u2020\n\u03c1\u0307 = \u2212 [Hsys + Hc , \u03c1] +\n\u03b3i Li \u03c1Li \u2212\nLi Li , \u03c1 ,\n~\n2\ni\n|\n{z\n}\nD(\u03c1)\n\n(1)\nwith an incoherent part D(\u03c1) that is due to the environment. Since we aim at creating entanglement, the\ntarget of control will be formulated here in terms of entanglement measures, i.e. its most natural quantifier. A\ntime-local quantum control strategy [6] for our target\nthen enables us to find that Hc (t), for which entangle-\n\nment is maximized under the dynamical constraints set\nby Eq. (1). Not surprisingly, the solution of this control\nproblem is optimal if the created entanglement is optimally adapted to the dynamics (1): i.e. if it is both robust\nunder decoherence, and efficiently creatable through the\nsystem interactions [7].\nWe will hence proceed by first defining our target as\na functional \u03c4 (\u03c1) of the system state in section I. Subsequently, in section II, we outline the time-local strategy\nto achieve the maximization of \u03c4 , and algebraically derive the corresponding optimal time-local control Hamiltonian. In section III, this strategy is specialized to the\nsituation of restricted, single-particle control fields and\nsubsequently numerically applied to an exemplary physical system which exhibits both interactions and environment coupling (sections IV and V). Finally, in sections VI\nand VII we will elaborate on the intrinsic robustness of\nour control strategy with respect to experimental imperfections and decoherence.\n\nI.\n\nTHE TARGET OF CONTROL\n\nIn general, quantum control can be formulated in terms\nof a functional \u03c4 (\u03c1) of the system state, called objective\nor target functional, that is maximized by application\nof suitably tailored control fields. The most frequently\napplied target functional is fidelity h\u03c8tar |\u03c1|\u03c8tar i [8\u201310],\nwhich quantifies the similarity of the system state to a\nspecific, predefined target state |\u03c8tar i. If we choose a\nhighly entangled multipartite state as target state, then\nthe achievement of maximal fidelity implies the success\nof creating entanglement in the system.\nThere exists, however, a multitude of states with\nequal entanglement properties-those, that are connected via single-particle (local) unitary transformations\n[11]-each of which may display distinct dynamical behavior. Among these states, some will show a more rapid\ndecay of entanglement under decoherence than the average, whereas some will feature rather robust entangle-\n\n\f2\nment [12, 13]. Similarly, some might be very hard to\nproduce under the given intrinsic system interactions,\nwhereas others are better suited for a specific interaction mechanism. To identify the most suitable entangled states-e.g. those which are robust under a given\nenvironmental coupling, or those which are easily and\nrapidly produced-is a highly non-trivial question, which\nhas only recently moved into the focus of research [14, 15].\nBy definition, entanglement measures directly quantify\nthe entanglement of a system, irrespective of the specific\nstate the entanglement is inscribed in-in other words,\nthey are invariant under local unitary transformations.\nTherefore, the choice of an entanglement measure as target functional allows to maximize entanglement without\nthe unnecessary and possibly disadvantageous restriction\nto one specific target state [7]. What is more, as we will\nsee shortly, with this choice for the target functional the\nmost suitable system states mentioned above are naturally created in the control process.\nAlthough the optimization of two-qubit entanglement\nbased on measures such as concurrence [16] was achieved\nbefore for pure states [17, 18], an extension to mixed\nstates in many-body systems requires efficiently accessible entanglement measures, and therefore was out of\nreach for a long time. Typically, entanglement measures\nE(\u03c1) for mixed states are defined via an optimization\nproblem, for example in terms of a given pure state entanglement measure E(\u03c8). An optimization is necessary\nto make the connection between E(\u03c1) and E(\u03c8) since\na mixed state \u03c1 can be represented by infinitely\nmany\nP\npure state ensembles {pi , |\u03c8i i}, with \u03c1 = i pi |\u03c8i ih\u03c8i |,\nwhich, in general, bear different average amounts of entanglement. A valid mixed state entanglement measure\nis given by the lowest average pure state entanglement of\nall possible ensembles [19], i.e.\nE(\u03c1) =\n\ninf\n\n{pi ,|\u03c8i i}\n\nX\n\npi E(\u03c8i ) .\n\n(2)\n\ni\n\nAn explicit and exact expression for this infimum is only\nknown for the frequently utilized measure concurrence for\ntwo qubits [16]. Generically, the optimization in Eq. (2)\ncan be performed at best for single states \u03c1, but becomes\ncomputationally intractable if to be evaluated over and\nover again for many different states, as is necessary for\nthe use as a target functional.\nWe will therefore resort to a lower bound of E(\u03c1) for a\nmany-body generalization\nE(\u03c8) =\n\np\n\nh\u03c8| \u2297 h\u03c8|V|\u03c8i \u2297 |\u03c8i, with\nX\nV=4\nP\u00b11 \u2297 . . . \u2297 P\u00b1N ,\n\n(3)\n\nof concurrence [20]. The P\u00b1i are projectors onto the\nsymmetric and antisymmetric subspace of the duplicate\nHilbert space Hi \u2297 Hi of subsystem i, and the sum runs\nover all combinations of P\u00b1i that involve an even number\nof projectors onto antisymmetric subspaces. The corre-\n\nsponding lower bound for mixed states [21, 22]\n\u03c4 = Tr(\u03c1 \u2297 \u03c1 A) \u2264 E(\u03c1)2 , with\nA = V \u2212 4(1 \u2212 21\u2212N )P \u2212 ,\n\n(4)\n\nis defined in terms of the projector P \u2212 onto the anti-symmetric component of the duplicate many-body Hilbert\nSpace H \u2297 H.\nThe functional \u03c4 satisfies all desired properties without\nsuffering from the prohibitive mathematical difficulties of\nan exact measure:\n- It is a purely algebraic function of the system's density matrix \u03c1 and hence is readily implemented as\nfigure of merit in quantum control.\n- It is invariant under local unitary dynamics, thus\ntreating all equally entangled states equally.\n- The lower bound's accuracy increases with increasing purity of the density matrix \u03c1. Since the most\nstrongly entangled states are pure, a suitable control field will drive a system towards pure states, so\nthat the approximation implicit in Eq.(4) is getting\nexact as the optimization's goal is reached.\nII.\n\nTHE CONTROL STRATEGY\n\nWith a suitable target functional at hand, we can now\nstrive for the optimization of entanglement dynamics by\nmeans of externally applied control fields. For that purpose, we will apply a time-local control strategy based\non Lyapunov control [6, 23], which achieves the maximization of the target functional by maximization of its\ntime-derivatives. The working principle of this strategy\nis illustrated by the fact that a maximized first derivative \u03c4\u0307 will subsequently lead to a more rapidly increasing\ntarget functional \u03c4 . This also holds for higher derivatives of \u03c4 : e.g. maximizing the curvature \u03c4\u0308 induces an\nincrease of the first derivative \u03c4\u0307 , which, in turn, spurs\nthe augmentation of \u03c4 .\nThe first time derivative of our target functional (4)\nreads\n\u03c4\u0307 = Tr(\u03c1\u0307 \u2297 \u03c1A + \u03c1 \u2297 \u03c1\u0307A) = 2Tr(\u03c1\u0307 \u2297 \u03c1A),\n\n(5)\n\nwhere the second equality holds since the expectation\nvalue of A is invariant under permutation of \u03c1 and \u03c1\u0307\n[22].\nBy virtue of Eq. (1), \u03c4\u0307 can be recast into the form\n\u001a\u0012\n\u0013\n\u001b\ni\n\u03c4\u0307 = 2Tr\n\u2212 [Hsys + Hc , \u03c1] + D(\u03c1) \u2297 \u03c1 A , (6)\n~\nand, since \u03c4\u0307 depends linearly on Hc , we can describe the\ninfluence of external control by the partial derivatives\nof \u03c4\u0307 with respect to the free parameters in the control\nHamiltonian Hc\n\u03c4\u0307 =\n\n\u2202\u03c4\nHc + \u03c4\u03070 .\n\u2202Hc\n\n(7)\n\n\f3\nHere the term \u03c4\u03070 represents the natural dynamics of \u03c4 in\nthe absence of control.\nTo be more explicit, for n finite-dimensional subsystems, we can expand Hc in a suitable operator basis as\nX\n(1)\n(n)\nHc =\n\u03b2\u03be1 \u2297 . . . \u2297 \u03b2\u03ben h\u03be~ = \u03b2~ * ~h,\n(8)\n{\u03be1 ,...,\u03ben }\n\nwhere the superscript (n) indicates that the basis element\n(n)\n\u03b2\u03ben acts on the nth particle's Hilbert space, and \u03ben labels\nthe basis elements of the corresponding subspace. The\nexpansion coefficients h\u03be~, which encode the strength of\nthe different components of the control Hamiltonian, are\nappropriately labeled such that they represent a single\nvector ~h. In this notation, the partial derivative with\nrespect to Hc in Eq. (7) turns into the partial derivatives\nwith respect to the components of ~h:\n\u03c4\u0307 =\n\nX \u2202\u03c4\n~ (\u03c1, Hsys , D) + \u03c4\u03070 .\nhi + \u03c4\u03070 = ~h * Y\n\u2202hi\ni\n\n(9)\n\nIn this form, one can see that \u03c4\u0307 can be conveniently writ~ , encompassing the\nten as a scalar product of the vector Y\n~\n~\npartial derivatives \u2202\u03c4 /\u2202hi , with h. Y is an algebraic expression of the system's state \u03c1(t), of the inter-particle\ninteractions Hsys , and of the incoherent evolution D induced by environmental noise. Finally, from Eq. (9) we\ncan read off what will be the optimal control Hamiltonian that maximizes the first derivative of our target\nfunctional: for a given maximal norm of the vector ~h,\n~ to maximize \u03c4\u0307 .\nwe have to choose ~h k Y\nAgain, the nature of these control fields ~h is strictly\ntime-local-i.e. they result in a maximal time derivative\n\u03c4\u0307 (t) in one particular instant t, and depend on the system state at that time alone, ~h(\u03c1(t)). In contrast, an\noptimization over the whole control time interval which\nis performed in optimal control [10, 24, 25], yields globally optimal pulses with potentially better performance.\nHowever, not only that our straightforward time-local\nstrategy is numerically significantly less demanding, since\nit requires only one single propagation of the control system (optimal control algorithms such as KROTOV [25]\nand GRAPE [10] require many iterations of forward and\nbackward propagation). It has also proven to create maximum entanglement on the same time scales as the aforementioned time-global control strategies, as we will see\nin the numerical studies in Sec. IV.\n\nIII. RESTRICTED CONTROL:\nMANIPULATING SINGLE PARTICLE\nDYNAMICS\n\nIn the preceding section we have derived control fields\nthat maximize \u03c4\u0307 under the assumption that an arbitrary\ncontrol Hamiltonian Hc such as (8) is at our disposal.\nHowever, a control scheme designed for application to\n\na broad range of physical systems has to take into account that experimentally implementable controls may\nbe restricted-e.g. in many experiments it is difficult or\neven virtually impossible to engineer inter-particle interactions. This means that, realistically, we have to assume\nthat Hc can induce only local unitary time evolution of \u03c1,\ni.e. a local control Hamiltonian (not to be confused with\nthe meaning of a time-local control strategy explained\nabove). In the present section we will derive the control\nHamiltonian under this restriction.\nThe most general local Hamiltonian for n finite dimensional particles reads\nHc =\n\ndi\nn X\nX\n\n(i)\n\n(i)\n\nh\u03bei \u03b2\u03bei ,\n\n(10)\n\ni=1 \u03bei =1\n(i)\n\nwhere the operators \u03b2\u03bei form a basis of the ith particle's\nHilbert space. For ease of notation, in the following we\nwill consider two-level systems (e.g. spin-1/2 particles)\n(i)\n(i)\nand choose the Pauli matrices \u03b2\u03bei = \u03c3\u03be (\u03be \u2208 {x, y, z})\nas operator basis, although our derivation remains valid\nalso for higher dimensional systems.\nHere, it is important to recall that our control functional (4) is invariant under the local unitary dynamics\ninduced by a local Hamiltonian. Therefore, \u03c4\u0307 will not\ndepend on Hc . In general, only non-local Hamiltonians\n(e.g. interactions) or local, but non-unitary, dynamics\n(e.g. decoherence) can induce a change of entanglement.\nSince \u03c4\u0307 does not reveal the influence of local control\non the entanglement dynamics, we have to resort to \u03c4\u0308\nto identify the optimal control Hamiltonian. In contrast\nto \u03c4\u0307 , which describes the entanglement dynamics in first\norder in dt, \u03c4\u0308 describes the change of entanglement in two\ninfinitesimal time steps. \u03c4\u0308 thus contains the information\nof how the impact of interactions and decoherence in a\nsecond time-step is affected if the system is manipulated\nlocally in the first step. Formally, this is reflected in the\nbilinear dependence of \u03c4\u0308 on the generator of the system\ndynamics, that gives rise to cross-terms of Hc and Hsys or\nD. As we will see shortly, this interplay of local, coherent\ncontrol, on the one hand, and of system interactions or\nincoherent dynamics, on the other, enables us to control\nthe entanglement dynamics through local manipulation\nonly.\nLet us spell this out, for the sake of clarity. Our objective is now the maximization of the curvature\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u03c4\u0308 = 2Tr {\u03c1\u0308 \u2297 \u03c1 + \u03c1\u0307 \u2297 \u03c1\u0307}A .\n(11)\nThis curvature \u03c4\u0308 is a function of \u03c1\u0307 and \u03c1\u0308, given by the\nequation of motion (1), and by the time derivative of\nEq. (1), respectively. Since only the state \u03c1 and the control Hamiltonian Hc in Eq.

(14) which involves Hc bilinearly, and the term that\ninvolves the time derivative \u1e22c necessarily vanish. This\ncan be seen by considering a purely coherent evolution\nof non-interacting particles-i.e. Hsys = 0 and L = 0.\nIn this case, the system follows a purely local unitary\ntime evolution under Hc , which, as argued above, leaves\n\u03c4 unchanged.

(14) for \u03c4\u0308 then reduces to those terms that contain\nboth Hc and Hsys , which represent the aforementioned\n\ninterplay between the system interactions with external\ncontrol, plus those terms that contain both Hc and D, i.e.\nthe interplay between control and decoherence. The former is of nonlocal type, whereas the latter is non-unitary\nand, hence, this interplay does affect the system entanglement. It therefore allows us to change the dynamics\nof entanglement through local control.\nTo put it in more physical terms: although local control itself cannot change the system entanglement, it can\nvery well induce a change towards a state with different\ndynamical properties. In this sense, the interplay of Hc\nand Hsys reveals which local rotations one needs to apply,\nsuch that subsequently the intrinsic system interactions\ncan efficiently entangle the constituent particles. More\nprecisely, by maximization of the corresponding terms\nin Eq. (14), we drive the system towards those states\nfor which interactions create entanglement most rapidly.\nAnalogously, the interplay of Hc and D provides information on how to change the system state locally, to render\nits entanglement least vulnerable to the environmental\ninfluence, and the optimum is reached by maximization\nof the corresponding terms. In systems subject to both,\ninteractions and decoherence, the maximum of the curvature \u03c4\u0308 (14) typically corresponds to a trade-off between\nhigh robustness and high entangling efficiency. Therefore, the optimal states reached automatically by our control strategy are those highly entangled states which are\nrapidly produced and which are, at the same time, robust\nagainst environmental decoherence. Both properties are\ncrucial when it comes to the experimental implementation of control, and we will investigate them in detail in\nSec. IV and VI.\nTo find out what will be the optimal control Hamiltonian that achieves the above objectives, we follow the\nsame scheme as in Sec. II. The curvature \u03c4\u0308 in Eq. (14)\ndepends linearly on Hc , since, as argued above, bilinear\nterms vanish. Using the expansion (10) of Hc , we can\nrewrite \u03c4\u0308 as\nX \u2202 \u03c4\u0308 (i)\nX\n~h(i) * X\n~ (i) (\u03c1, Hsys , D) + \u03c4\u03080 ,\n\u03c4\u0308 =\nh\n+\n\u03c4\u0308\n=\n0\n\u03be\n(i)\n\u2202h\ni\ni,\u03be\n\u03be\n(17)\nP\n(i)\n(i)\n~\nwith X = \u03be \u2202 \u03c4\u0308 /\u2202h\u03be .

Only when X\nvanishes within numerical accuracy, we will switch off the\ncontrol Hamiltonian to regularize the problem.\nTypically, an initial state is prepared by a set of local measurements on the individual subsystems and is\ntherefore separable. Although, in principle, arbitrary\ninitial states can be chosen, in the specific case of the\nIsing Hamiltonian (20) that we will investigate below,\neigenstates of Hsys lead to a vanishing curvature. Consequently, we obtain vanishing partial derivatives (18) of \u03c4\u0308\nwith respect to the components of the control Hamilto(i)\n~ (i) = 0.

This offers a great advantage\nover numerical algorithms in optimal control theory, since\nfor a given system we can express the control Hamiltonian Hc in terms of an arbitrary state \u03c1, of the given\nintrinsic interaction Hsys , and of the given dissipator D\nonce and for all. The optimal time evolution starting\nfrom an arbitrary initial state is then obtained by simple\nnumerical integration, and, what is more, by one single\npropagation.\nIV.\n\nAPPLICATION TO FOUR INTERACTING\nPARTICLES: THE COHERENT CASE\n\nAfter the derivation of the algebraic foundations of our\ncontrol strategy, we now turn to the demonstration of its\neffectiveness and its robustness. For that purpose, let\n\nus consider four interacting spin-1/2 particles (Fig. 1)\nwith permanent interactions, as for example in nitrogen\nvacancy (NV) centers in diamond [26] or nuclear spins in\na molecule [27].\nIn the present section we will investigate the coherent\ntime evolution (i.e. in the absence of environment coupling) under an Ising-type Hamiltonian\nHsys =\n\n4\nX\n\n\u03bbi,j \u03c3z(i) \u2297 \u03c3z(j) ,\n\n(20)\n\ni,j=1\ni<j\n\nas a model, for example, for dipole-dipole interactions. In\nthe case of dipole-dipole interactions, the coupling constants \u03bbi,j are fixed by the inter-particle distances, and\nhere the following randomly chosen set {\u03bbi,j } is used:\n\u03bb1,2 = 9.8 MHz \u03bb1,3 = 0.1 MHz \u03bb1,4 = 0.3 MHz\n\u03bb2,3 = 1.3 MHz \u03bb2,4 = 0.5 MHz\n\u03bb3,4 = 2.7 MHz.\n(21)\nFor the sake of concreteness, the interaction strengths are\nchosen to match the scale which is typically observed for\nNV centers [28].\nExcept for Sec. VI we choose separable initial states to\ndemonstrate the optimal creation of entanglement in the\ncontrol system. The numerical results presented in the\nfollowing have been obtained for the exemplary initial\nstate\n\u0010\u221a\n\u0011\u22974\n\u221a\n|\u03c6i i =\n\u03b1|0i + 1 \u2212 \u03b1 ei\u03b8 |1i\n,\n(22)\nwith \u03b1 = 0.73 and \u03b8 = 0.51\u03c0. Since local control rapidly\ndrives the system towards that separable state with entanglement growing most rapidly the performance of our\ncontrol scheme is largely independent of our choice of\nthe separable initial state |\u03c6i i, as we have also confirmed\nnumerically.\nThe time evolution of \u03c4 in the absence of control is depicted in Fig. 2 a, by a dashed line. \u03c4 starts out at zero,\nsince the initial state is separable. Then, the entanglement increases due to interactions, and finally oscillates\naround mediocre values of about 0.5, on the characteristic\ntime scales of Hsys (indicated by dashed vertical lines).\nThe most rapid oscillations of \u03c4 can be clearly identified\nwith the time scale corresponding to \u03bb1,2 , and they are\nsuperposed with oscillations on longer time scales corresponding to the other coupling constants. We can see\nthat, on the considered time-interval of one micro-second,\nstrong entanglement with \u03c4 \u2248 1 is not reached by the\nnatural time evolution of the system.\nLet us now optimize the entanglement dynamics-i.e.\nmaximize the curvature of \u03c4 -through continuous application of the optimal local control Hamiltonian derived in\nthe previous section. The dotted line in Fig. 2 a shows\nthe impact of weak control fields, with maximum amplitude that amounts to only a fraction of the system's\nintrinsic energy scale (hmax = 0.26 \u03bb1,2 , where \u03bb1,2 is the\n\n\f6\n\na\n\n20\n\n0.75\n\n10\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n0.25\n00\n\n\u03c0/4\u03bb1,2 \u03c0/4\u03bb3,4\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n\u03c0/4\u03bb2,3\n0.6\n\nt (\u03bcs)\n\n0.8\n\n-10\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\nt (\u03bcs)\n\n0.8\n\nb\nA (MHz)\n\n\u03c4\n\n1\n\n1-20\n\nFIG. 2. a-Time evolution of entanglement, quantified by the target functional \u03c4 , for the separable initial state (22) and\ncoupling constants (21).

We can see that, despite this\nrather small control amplitude, the system experiences\na considerable increase of its average entanglement from\n0.5 to about 0.8 after a time t \u2248 \u03c0/4\u03bb3,4 (the second\nlargest coupling constant). Yet, oscillations of \u03c4 prevail,\nsince the natural dynamics is still dominant.\n\n(solid line in Fig. 2 a), the control fields hx and hy\n(see Fig. 2 b) oscillate with a frequency of 17 MHz. This\nis due to the fact that, on the one hand, Hc induces a\nchange in \u03c1 on this time scale and, on the other, that Hc\nis implicitly time dependent through its dependence on\n\u03c1(t).\n\nFor the system dynamics becoming more and more\ndominated by the control Hamiltonian Hc , i.e. for higher\nand higher control field amplitudes, Eq. (17) predicts an\nincrease of the curvature \u03c4\u0308 and therefore an increase of\nthe average system entanglement. And indeed, our numerics confirm this stabilization of entanglement at ever\nhigher average values when increasing the control amplitude. Still remarkably weak control fields with an amplitude of 17 MHz \u2248 1.7 \u03bb1,2 (solid line in Fig. 2 a) result in\nmaximal entanglement \u03c4 = 1, after a control time of the\norder of t = \u03c0/4\u03bb2,3 , where \u03bb2,3 is the third largest coupling constant. Oscillations of \u03c4 are flattened out, and\nonce maximal entanglement is reached it is essentially\nmaintained.\n\nTherefore, as we increase the control field amplitude\nwe also change the time scale on which our control fields\ncan react to the natural system dynamics. For values of\nhmax = 200 MHz, we expect that the time scales of Hc\nand Hsys separate, and that the control Hamiltonian can\nreact instantly to the natural time evolution of the system. Indeed, instantaneous control is manifest in sharp\n(1)\npulses in the hx -component of the control field at t = 0\nand t = \u03c0/4\u03bb1,2 (see Fig. 3, red line, y-axis on the right\nhand side). They rapidly drive the system to those states\nwhose entanglement subsequently increases during a finite time interval under Hsys alone, with no external control present. In addition, during a time interval before\nt = \u03c0/4\u03bb3,4 and after reaching maximum entanglement,\nit seems to be necessary to supplement the natural dynamics with permanent control. In particular, once maximal entanglement is reached after t \u2248 0.45 \u03bcs, Hc and\nHsys act as an effective Hamiltonian that performs only\nlocal unitaries on the final state |\u03c6f i, as will be verified\nshortly, thus maintaining the value of entanglement at\n\u03c4 = 1.\n\nHowever, further augmenting the control amplitude\nyields no substantial acceleration of entanglement creation, and saturation sets in. The saturation of \u03c4 is apparent for example for hmax = 200 MHz \u2248 20 \u03bb1,2 , as\ndepicted in Fig. 3 by a blue line. Now, \u03c4 (t) is perfectly\nsmooth, but reaches its maximum essentially at the same\ntime as for control with an amplitude of 17 MHz. This\nsaturation is due to the fact that a local control Hamiltonian on its own cannot create any entanglement, but can\nonly help to exploit the interactions in an optimal fashion. It is the interaction strength that sets the limiting\ntimescale for the creation of entanglement.\nLet us discuss a bit more in detail how our applied\ncontrol fields achieve the maximization of entanglement.\nFirst, note that the control fields act on the time scale\nassociated with the Rabi period of their amplitudes hmax :\ne.g. in the case of optimal control with hmax = 17 MHz\n\nSecond, let us turn to the efficiency of the control process. As argued above, the only mechanism that can\ncreate entanglement in the considered setup is the interaction. It therefore defines a limiting time scale tE below\nwhich maximal entanglement cannot be created. The\ngreatest coupling constant in Hsys (\u03bb1,2 in the case of\ncoupling constants (21)) defines the time-scale at which\none Bell pair can be created. In the present case this Bell\npair is formed between qubits one and two. And indeed,\naround the kink in the evolution of \u03c4 (t) at t = \u03c0/4\u03bb1,2\n\n\f7\n\n1\nFf\n\n0.75\n\n0.9\n0.8\n\nF3\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n0.25\n\n-200\n\n\u03c0/4\u03bb1,2\n0\n0\n\nFidelity\n\n200\n\nA (MHz)\n\n\u03c4\n\n1\n\n0.2\n\n0.6\n\n\u03c0/4\u03bb3,4 \u03c0/4\u03bb2,3\n\nt (\u03bcs)\n\n(as seen Fig. 3 and, less prominently, in Fig. 2) the entanglement corresponds to that of a single Bell pair, namely\n\u03c4 = 1/2. Analogous arguments apply for the second\nlargest coupling constant (in this case \u03bb3,4 ), and indicate\nthat, after t = \u03c0/4\u03bb3,4 , the system can be described as\na pair of Bell pairs. Finally, the third strongest interaction entangles the two Bell-pairs and creates genuine\nfour-particle entanglement, and maximum entanglement\nis reached on the time scale of the third largest coupling\nconstant tE = \u03c0/4\u03bb2,3 .\nIn other words, each pairwise interaction leads to quantum correlations between two constituents and three\npairwise couplings are needed to connect the four particles in our setup. Therefore, it is not surprising that genuine four-particle entanglement (i.e. four particle quantum correlations) can only arise on the time scale of the\nsmallest of these three coupling constants. We want to\nstress here, that, with our control strategy, maximum\nentanglement is reached on this shortest possible time\nscale.\nAt the end of the control process, our analyses indicate\nthat the target functional \u03c4 in Eq. (4) is maximized by\nfinal states that are equivalent to\n\u0011\n1\u0010\n|\u03c6max i =\n|0000i + |1111i + i(|0011i + |1100i) (23)\n2\nunder local rotations or possibly permutations of subsystems. This has been verified for a large number of different initial states and coupling constants. Interestingly,\nthe specific ordering of subsystems in the final state of\nthe control process is determined by the largest coupling\nconstants: if qubits i and j are strongly coupled, those\nstates of maximal \u03c4 will be preferred that involve the\ncollective ground and excited states of the pair (i, j). In\nthe present case of a system Hamiltonian with coupling\nconstants given by (21), where qubits one and two and\nqubits three and four are particularly strongly coupled,\nwe observe the creation of the collective ground and ex-\n\nFi\n\n0.50\n\n0.4\n\nFIG. 3.

As mentioned before, our control Hamiltonian\nwas designed to explicitly account for decoherence and,\nwhat is more, to minimize its detrimental impact on entanglement.\nHere, we will focus on the paradigmatic model of a dephasing environment. In particular, we will consider the\nsituation where each spin is coupled to a separate environment, meaning that spins cannot interact with each\nother via the environment. This assumption is justified if\nthe environmental noise at the location of different spins\nis completely uncorrelated, e.g. due to their big spatial\nseparation, or due to the sufficiently rapid decay of bath\ncorrelation functions. In this case, the Lindblad operators in the master equation act locally, and we have\n(i)\nLi = \u03c3z in Eq. (1) (i.e. the third Pauli matrix, acting\non the ith spin). Furthermore, we will assume that the\ndephasing rates felt by different spins are equal (\u03b3i = \u0393,\nfor i = 1 . . . 4).\nWe first consider four spins that experience a dephasing rate of \u03931 = 0.02 \u03bcs\u22121 and interact through dipoledipole interactions quantified by (21). As the interaction\nstrengths (21) are roughly based on the time scales realized in NV centers, it has to be mentioned that \u03931 is\ntwo orders of magnitude stronger than decoherence rates\nin state of the art NV center experiments [29]. Since\n\u0393\u22121\n= 50\u03bcs, the average life-time of single-particle co1\n\nherences in the density matrix \u03c1 is about two orders of\nmagnitude longer than the characteristic time scale of the\nsystem Hamiltonian, which is of the order of 0.1\u03bcs and\nwe expect the time-evolution of \u03c1 to be dominated by\ninteractions. One has to keep in mind though, that genuine multipartite entanglement relies on the existence of\nmany-body coherences which generally fall off much more\nrapidly as the number of particles involved increases [30].\nFig. 5 shows the time evolution of \u03c4 under the influence\nof dephasing with rate \u03931 . The free entanglement dynamics in the absence of control (dashed line) is reminiscent\nof the purely coherent case (Fig. 2, dashed line), with\noscillations on time scales of Hsys around \u03c4 (t) \u2248 0.5. As\nexpected, coherent oscillations between states that bear\ndifferent amounts of entanglement prevail over the entire\nobservation period of one microsecond.\nIn contrast, our control scheme steers the system into\nalmost maximal entanglement, \u03c4 = 0.95 (black solid\nline), for the maximum control amplitude hmax = 1.7\u03bb1,2 .\nAnd this is achieved despite the fact that our entanglement measure targets genuine four-particle entanglement, which, as mentioned above, is most prone to\nenvironmental noise. Although decoherence cannot be\navoided completely and entanglement will subsequently\ndecay, the controlled entanglement dynamics outperforms the uncontrolled time evolution by far.\nIn order to test fundamental limits for the creation\nand existence of entanglement we imposed even stronger\ndephasing with rate \u03932 = 0.2 \u03bcs\u22121 (red lines in Fig. 5).\nEven in this case, our control strategy creates a considerable amount of entanglement (solid line). Despite the\nfact that dephasing takes its toll on entanglement as time\ngoes by, the control fields stabilize the amount of entanglement at an average value which almost doubles that\nachieved by the uncontrolled system dynamics (dashed\nline).\n\nVI.\n\nROBUST ENTANGLED STATES\n\nWe have seen that our control strategy permits to create considerable entanglement in spite of the detrimental\ninfluence of dephasing. This efficiency in the presence of\nenvironment coupling is a consequence of the maximization of \u03c4\u0308 in Eq. (17). Since decoherence effects explicitly enter this expression, we claimed that the system is\nsteered into the state that is least sensitive to the dissipator D(\u03c1), i.e. most robust against environment coupling.\nThis claim will be substantiated in the following.\nAs argued above, the open system evolution considered up to now was dominated by the system's coherent\ndipole-dipole interactions, and decoherence only made itself felt through a gradual degradation of entanglement.\nA state's robustness with respect to decoherence, however, becomes most obvious if we consider systems with\nnegligible intrinsic interactions (e.g. if the spins are located a large distances), such that entanglement is expected to decay monotonically [12, 31].\n\n\f9\n\n80\n\n0.6\n\n\u03c4\n\n40\n0.2\n20\n00\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\nt (\u03bcs)\n\n0.3\n\nA (MHz)\n\n60\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\nFIG. 6. Entanglement evolution in a non-interacting system\nunder dephasing with rate \u0393 = 0.8 \u03bcs\u22121 . We compare \u03c4 (t)\nfor a pure, entangled initial state under control (black line,\nhmax = 17 MHz) with that for 50 local unitary equivalent\nstates without control (grey area). The optimal time-local\n(1)\ncontrol Hamiltonian (here the exemplary hx -component) is\ncomprised of only one short pulse in the beginning (red line,\naxis on the right).\n\nConsequently, we now assume that the spins be uncoupled (\u03bbi,j = 0, \u2200 i, j), but subject to dephasing with rate\n\u0393 = 0.8 \u03bcs\u22121 . Additionally, we take a pure, entangled initial state with \u03c4 (0) = 0.55, and compare its entanglement\nevolution under control (black line in Fig. 6) with the\nentanglement evolution of 50 uncontrolled, local-unitary\nequivalent initial states, that are uniformly distributed\nwith respect to the Haar measure [32] (gray area). And\nindeed, the control fields produce that state which is\nmost robust to decoherence, with an entanglement lifetime about 1.75 times longer than that of generic, uncontrolled and therefore non-robust states. This advantage\nof the most robust state over non-robust states in terms of\nentanglement lifetime is less pronounced for higher initial entanglement: for an initial state with \u03c4 (0) = 0.8\n(\u03c4 (0) = 1), the time span after which entanglement has\ndecayed is prolonged only by a factor of 1.3 (1.05). This,\nhowever, is not due to an insufficiency of our control\nstrategy-it finds the most robust states, irrespective of\nthe initial entanglement.\nThe existence of particularly robust entanglement\namong weakly entangled states has implications both for\nfundamental and practical considerations. On the one\nhand, it may shed light on the possibility for entanglement to survive even in situations of extreme environment coupling [33, 34]-a situation that strongly contrasts our intuition, which is based on experiments with\nhighly entangled states [1]. On the other hand, when it\ncomes to the exploitation of entanglement for quantum\ninformation processing, weakly entangled states can be\nmore useful than highly entangled ones [35], which underlines the potential that lies in the choice of states with\nparticularly robust entanglement properties.\nBeyond the existence of particularly robust, weakly en-\n\ntangled states, there are two more facts that strike the eye\nin the above control setting with dephasing. First, the\n(1)\ncontrol Hamiltonian (its hx -amplitude is represented by\na red line in Fig. 6 with the corresponding y-axis on the\nright) mainly consists of a short pulse at the beginning of\nthe time evolution, and only very weak control thereafter\n(not discernible on the scale of the plot). This implies\nthat the main contribution to the robustness of entanglement lies in choosing a proper initial state, and that\nits robustness is conserved under the dynamics of dephasing. Second, the robust state found by our control\nstrategy is outstandingly robust: its entanglement sticks\nout significantly from that of a generic uncontrolled state\nand among the 50 shown in Fig. 6 none comes even close.\nThis indicates that robustness is a property that is shared\nby only very few states. We have, however, ruled out that\nthey merely form a set of measure zero within state space,\nby verifying that their robustness is insensitive to perturbations in first order. More specifically, a local unitary\nrotation of the robust state by 0.01\u03c0 (0.05\u03c0) leads to at\nmost 0.1% (1.6%) higher entanglement decay rates. This\nmeans that robustness will not be destroyed by small,\nunavoidable experimental imperfections.\n\nVII.\n\nROBUSTNESS OF CONTROL PULSES\n\nReal world experiments on quantum systems not only\nsuffer from environment coupling, as considered above,\nbut also from experimental imperfections, such as amplitude or phase fluctuations of the control laser fields,\nor imprecise knowledge of system properties, such as the\ncoupling constants \u03bbij in (21). A very important aspect of the performance of control sequences in general is\ntherefore their robustness with respect to such imperfections. In this section we will test the performance of the\noptimal control pulses under white noise perturbations\nof the control fields, constant offsets of their amplitudes,\nand imprecisely estimated coupling constants.\nTo estimate the impact of experimental imperfections\non entanglement correctly, it is crucial to distinguish\nbetween systematic and random (or stochastic) errors.\nWhereas the former can be assumed constant in consecutive runs of the experiment, the latter will typically differ from one run to another. Taking into account that\nthe quantification of entanglement, as that of any physical property, requires a whole series of measurements on\nconsecutively prepared system states, the final state in\na randomly perturbed control process needs to be described as a probabilistic mixture of pure states {|\u03c8i i},\ni.e. a mixed state \u03c1. According to Eq. (2), the entanglement inscribed in the mixed final state \u03c1 is then generally lower than the average entanglement in the pure\nstate ensemble {|\u03c8i i}. In the presence of a systematic\nerror, however, one will prepare one and the same faulty\nfinal pure state in consecutive runs. Hence, the final entanglement will not suffer from an additional final state\nuncertainty, and can be estimated as the average pure\n\n\f10\n\na\n\n20\n\n0.75\n\n10\n\n0.5\n\n0\n-10\n\n0.25\n00\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\nt (\u03bcs)\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\nt (\u03bcs)\n\n0.8\n\nb\nA (MHz)\n\n\u03c4\n\n1\n\n1-20\n\nFIG. 7. a-\u03c4 (t) under unperturbed and perturbed control with 10% white noise in the control-pulses (black and blue dashed\nlines, respectively). Red dots represent the entanglement of the probabilistic mixture of 200 runs, with different realizations of\n(1)\nwhite noise. b-Unperturbed and perturbed control field hx (black and red lines, respectively) corresponding to a.\n\nstate entanglement for different realizations of the systematic error.\nIn order to quantify the influence of perturbations or\nparameter uncertainties with relative error \u03b5, we compare\nthe perturbed and unperturbed evolution of the system\nalready treated in section IV-i.e. four spins with dipoledipole interactions as specified by Eqs. (21, 22), in the\nabsence of dephasing. First, let us consider the random\nwhite noise perturbation of the control fields. In Fig. 7 a\nthe entanglement dynamics is plotted for a single run of\nthe control process, perturbed by a white noise signal\n(flat spectrum, cutoff at 100\u03c0 MHz) with 10% relative\namplitude, i.e. \u03b5 = 0.1 (blue dashed line). Compared to\nthe unperturbed time evolution of \u03c4 , the maximal entanglement is reduced by only 5%, and this deviation slowly\nincreases with time. The unperturbed and the perturbed\ncontrol field for this specific realization can be compared\nin Fig. 7 b. The entanglement of the probabilistic mixture of the states prepared in many different runs with\ndifferent realizations of white noise at equal relative amplitude converges to the red dotted line in Fig. 7 a. We\ncan see that, as expected, it falls off significantly below\nthe pure state entanglement in a single run.\nAs an exemplary systematic error, we consider the case\nthat the intrinsic dipole-dipole coupling constants \u03bbi,j\nare not known with perfect accuracy, as it typically is\nthe case due to measurement errors [28]. The entanglement dynamics in presence of a 10% relative error of all\n\u03bbi,j , i.e. \u03b5 = 0.1, is plotted in Fig. 8 a. Maximum entanglement is reduced by about 10% in one single run,\nwhich is about twice as much as in the case of a single\nrealization with white noise. As explained above, however, this systematic error will not induce mixing in the\nfinal state, and, hence, no additional penalty (in terms\nof entanglement) has to be paid upon experimental iteration. To rule out that, based on our specific realization\nof the error, we either over- or underestimate the impact\non entanglement, we also averaged the entanglement dy-\n\nnamics over many runs with different realizations of the\nerrors in \u03bbi,j (red dotted line). The average entanglement\ndynamics confirms the 10% reduction of entanglement.\nFinally, we want to quantify the entanglement drop-off\nas a function of the error parameter \u03b5. Since the control\n~ are parallel to\nHamiltonian is chosen such that ~h and X\neach other, an imperfection will typically result in a finite angle \u03b1 between these two vectors. The curvature\n~ (see Eq. (13))\n\u03c4\u0308 determined by the scalar product ~h * X\nis consequently reduced by a factor of cos \u03b1, which will\nresult in a slower increase of entanglement. Since, however, the cos-function is independent of \u03b1 in first order\naround \u03b1 = 0, we expect the performance of our control\nstrategy to be insensitive to small imperfections.\nThe performance for finite imperfections is shown in\nFig. 8 b, where the average maximum entanglement \u03c4\u0304\nreached with perturbed control is depicted as a function\nof the relative strength \u03b5 of the different error sources\nmentioned above (blue: white noise; black: wrong coupling constants \u03bbi,j , red: systematic offset of control\nfields). Conforming with our predictions on systematic\nand random errors, the white noise perturbation reduces\nthe performance of the control process the most, whereas\na systematic offset in the control fields and a wrong prediction of the coupling constants \u03bbi,j have less negative\nimpact. As expected, the first order term or slope at\n\u03b5 = 0 vanishes, i.e. d\u03c4\u0304 /d\u03b5|\u03b5=0 = 0, for all three errortypes. Even in the presence of errors in the percentrange, the system ends up in a strongly entangled state.\nThe small offset \u03c4\u0304 < 1 for \u03b5 = 0, where in the absence of\nerrors one would have expected \u03c4 = 1, arises since, in addition to an ensemble average, we also performed a timeaverage over the interval 0.3\u03bcs \u2264 t \u2264 1\u03bcs. This timeaverage, at the employed control amplitude of hmax = 17\nMHz, comprises instances in which \u03c4 deviates from its\nmaximum value, as can be seen for example in the black\nline in Fig. 7 a at t \u2248 0.6\u03bcs.\nIn consequence, with the above robustness to system-\n\n\f11\n\na\n\n1\n\n1\n\nb\n\n0.75\n\n0.8\n\n\u03c4\n\n0.5\n\n\u03c4\n0.6\n\n0.25\n00\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\nt (\u03bcs)\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n\u03b5 (%)\n\n8\n\n10\n\nFIG. 8. a-\u03c4 (t) under control and in the presence of a 10% uncertainty in the dipole-dipole coupling constants \u03bbi,j (blue\ndashed line), and averaged over 200 realizations of this 10% error (red dotted line). b-Average maximum entanglement \u03c4\nreached by faulty control pulses with amplitude hmax = 17MHz, averaged over 50 runs: \u03c4 as a function of the relative error \u03b5,\nfor a white noise perturbation (blue dotted line), for a constant offset in the control fields (red solid line), and for uncertain\ncoupling constants \u03bb (black dashed line).\n\nWe have seen that by applying a target functional with\nsuitable invariance properties, quantum control is able\nto straightforwardly maximize dynamical quantities of\nmany body systems. In the specific setting discussed\nhere, we saw an essentially optimal exploitation of interactions for entanglement creation, and simultaneous mitigation of decoherence. In particular, this was achieved\nby time-local control, i.e. without resorting to numerically expensive optimal control algorithms. However,\nthe implementation of our approach is not linked to any\nparticular control algorithm.\nMoreover, with the target functional unburdened of\nunnecessary restrictions (e.g. to specific system states),\nthe control problem holds the potential to unveil dynamical system properties without the necessity for prior\nknowledge thereof. Here, we were able to identify the\nmost robust states under environmental decoherence,\namong a multitude of equally entangled states. Needless to say that an investigation into their joint structural\nproperties and relation to the predominant decoherence\n\nmechanism might be of great benefit for the creation of\nentanglement in open quantum systems.\nOur approach is by no means limited to the treatment\nof entanglement, as shown, for example, by the successful\nuse of invariant target functionals for quantum gates [36],\ni.e. elementary building blocks of quantum algorithms, or\nfor the attenuation of polarization in nuclear magnetic\nresonance [37]. More generally, in complex quantum systems for which we lack a physical intuition, the use of\ncontrol techniques that can identify states with particular\nproperties bears the potential to fill this void. For example, the identification of states with particular robustness\nproperties may substantially change our understanding of\nthe existence of quantum signatures in hot, biomolecular processes such as photosynthesis [38, 39]. In quantum chemistry, one can also think of control tasks which\ntarget molecular (i.e. many-body) properties associated\nnot to specific electronic or vibrational states, but to a\nmultitude thereof-think of bond length as a prominent\nexample [40]. Instead of driving one specific pathway\nfor a wave-packet on a landscape of Born-Oppenheimer\nsurfaces, this could enable us to search for the most suitable quantum dynamics for the desired purpose, which,\nin general, involves complex superpositions in the highdimensional Hilbert space of the molecule. In short, the\npresent approach permits to extend the potential of quantum control by shifting the focus from reaching a goal in\nan optimal fashion to identifying the optimal goal in the\nfirst place.\n\n[1] T.
