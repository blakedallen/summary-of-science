It indicates that the non-axisymmetric magnetic field plays an important\nrole in the origin of solar activity. A linear non-axisymmetric \u03b12 \u2212 \u03a9 dynamo model\nis set up to discuss the characteristics of the axisymmetric (m = 0) and the first nonaxisymmetric (m = 1) modes and to provide further the theoretical bases to explain\nthe 'active longitude', 'flip-flop' and other non-axisymmetric phenomena. The model\nconsists of a updated solar internal differential rotation, a turbulent diffusivity varied\nwith depth and an \u03b1-effect working at the tachocline in rotating spherical systems.\nThe difference between the \u03b12 \u2212 \u03a9 and the \u03b1 \u2212 \u03a9 models and the conditions to favor\nthe non-axisymmetric modes with the solar-like parameters are also presented.\nKey words: magnetic fields \u2013 MHD \u2013 Sun: activity \u2013 Sun: magnetic fields.\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe distribution of magnetic field emerging on the solar\nsurface carries clues to the mechanism of the field generation. One striking feature of this distribution is clustering of active regions which is commonly called 'active longitude' (Bai 1987; Benevolenskaya et al. 1999;\nDe Toma, White & Harvey 2000). Signatures of possible\nlongitudinal inhomogeneities have also been reported in\nthe distributions of solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field (Neugebauer et al. 2000). Furthermore, 'flipflop' phenomenon, i.e. the two persistent active longitudes\nseparated by 180\u25e6 , has also been identified on the Sun\n(Berdyugina & Usoskin 2003). These observations indicate\nthe involvement of large-scale non-axisymmetric magnetic\nfield in the formation and evolution of the dominant axisymmetric solar activities. Hence, it is valuable to set up\nthe non-axisymmetric dynamo model to explain these nonaxisymmetric solar magnetic fields.\nThe pioneer works on the theoretical investigations of\nthe non-axisymmetric activities can be classed mainly as\ntwo kinds. One is that the generation sources are nonaxisymmetric, and the non-axisymmetric magnetic field is\nproduced accordingly. For example, Bigazzi & Ruzmaikin\n(2004) and Moss et al. (2002) adopted the non-axisymmetric\ndistribution of \u03b1-effect. The other is based on the axisymmetric sources of generation but to excite the non-\n\n\u22c6\n\nE-mail: jiangjie@ourstar.bao.ac.cn (JJ); wangjx@bao.ac.cn\n\naxisymmetric field. The numerical results of Chan et al.\n(2004) supported this possibility.\nEarlier studies (Stix 1971; Ivanova & Ruzmaikin\n1985) concerning the linear non-axisymmetric solar dynamo\nwith decoupled axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric modes\nhave been taken. But these earlier studies could not include\nthe correct distribution of solar differential rotation, which\nwas unknown at that time. Recently, there are some works\non the non-linear non-axisymmetric dynamo models. Moss\n(1999) obtained stable solutions which possessed a small\nnon-axisymmetric field component co-existing with a dominant axisymmetric part with the updated solar rotation profile. Bigazzi & Ruzmaikin (2004) studied the generation of\nnon-axisymmetric fields and their coupling with the axisymmetric solar magnetic field. Bassom et al. (2005) used an\nasymptotic WKBJ method to investigate a linear \u03b12 \u2212 \u03a9\nmodel with the aim to isolate the basic physical effects leading to the preferable excitation of non-axisymmetric solar\nand stellar magnetic structure. However, are there possibilities to work out a linear non-axisymmetric solar dynamo\nwith the updated generation sources to relate with the nonaxisymmetric phenomena? What are the differences, such\nas configuration and cycle and so on, between the axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric modes? When will the nonaxisymmetric mode be preferred? These are the main objectives of the paper.\nWith the axisymmetric sources of generation, we develop a new high-precision non-axisymmetric code based\non the spectral method and begin with the linear nonaxisymmetric mean field dynamo equations. The axisym-\n\n\f2\n\nJ. Jiang and J. X. Wang\n\nmetric mode m = 0 and the first non-axisymmetric mode\nm = 1 are discussed, respectively, in Sec.5 and Sec.6. We\nwill show the difference between the \u03b12 \u2212 \u03a9 and the \u03b1 \u2212 \u03a9\nmodels in Sec.3. In Sec. 4, the condition to excite the dominant axisymmetric mode and the condition to favor the\nnon-axisymmetric mode will be discussed.\n\n2\n\nMATHEMATIC FORMULATIONS\n\n2.1\n\nThe basic equations\n\nThe starting point of our model is the mean field dynamo\nequation, governing the evolution of the large-scale magnetic\nfield B in response to the flow field U, the \u03b1-effect and the\nmagnetic diffusivity \u03b7:\n\u2202B\n= \u2207 \u00d7 [U \u00d7 B + \u03b1B \u2212 \u03b7\u2207 \u00d7 B].\n(1)\n\u2202t\nSince the turbulent diffusivity is much larger than the molecular diffusivity, we ignore the molecular diffusivity in \u03b7. For\nthe flow field, only the (differential) rotation \u03a9 is considered\nfor simplicity. Since the magnetic field is divergence-free, we\nexpand B in term of two scalar functions h and g which represent the poloidal and toroidal potentials, respectively, in\nthe spherical polar coordinates (r, \u03b8, \u03c6) as Chandrasekhar\n(1961) and Moffatt (1978).\nB = \u2207 \u00d7 \u2207 \u00d7 rh(r, \u03b8, \u03c6, t) + \u2207 \u00d7 r g(r, \u03b8, \u03c6, t).\n\n(2)\n\nWhen \u03b1 = \u03b1(r, \u03b8), \u03a9 = \u03a9(r, \u03b8), \u03b7 = \u03b7(r), substituting equation(2) in equation (1), the governing equation reduces to:\n\u2202t L2 h\n\n=\n\nh\nh\nR\u03b1 V\u03b1g + \u03b7\u22072 L2 h + R\u03a9 V\u03a9N\n+ R\u03b1 V\u03b1N\n,\n\n\u2202t L2 g\n\n=\n\ng\ng\nR\u03b1 V\u03b1h + R\u03a9 V\u03a9h + R\u03a9 V\u03a9N\n+ R\u03b1 V\u03b1N\n\u2202\u03b7 \u2202 2\n1 \u2202\u03b7 2\n\u03b7\u22072 L2 g +\nL g+\nL g,\n\u2202r \u2202r\nr \u2202r\n\n+\n\n(3)\n\n(4)\n\nwhere\n1 \u2202\n1 \u2202 2 \u2202\n\u2202\n1\n1\n, \u22072 =\n(sin \u03b8 ) \u2212\nr\n\u2212 2 L2 .\nsin \u03b8 \u2202\u03b8\n\u2202\u03b8\nr \u2202r \u2202r\nr\nsin2 \u03b8\nV\u03a9N and V\u03b1N are the terms which have the azimuthal component \u2202/\u2202\u03c6 and V\u03a9 , V\u03b1 , V\u03a9N and V\u03b1N can be obtained\nfrom (see Appendix):\n\nL2 = \u2212\n\n=\n\nh\nV\u03b1g + V\u03b1N\n,\n\n(5)\n\nr * \u2207 \u00d7 (U \u00d7 B)\n\n=\n\n(6)\n\nr * \u2207 \u00d7 [\u2207 \u00d7 (\u03b1B)]\n\n=\n\nh\nV\u03a9N\n,\nV\u03b1h +\n\ng\nV\u03b1N\n,\n\n(7)\n\n=\n\nV\u03a9h\n\ng\nV\u03a9N\n.\n\n(8)\n\nr * \u2207 \u00d7 (\u03b1B)\n\nr * \u2207 \u00d7 [\u2207 \u00d7 (U \u00d7 B)]\n\n+\n\nThe equations (3) and (4) have been cast in non-dimensional\nform by expressing all lengths in units of solar radius R\u2299 and\n2\ntime in units of the magnetic diffusion time R\u2299\n/\u03b7o . This has\nled to the appearance of two dimensionless numbers:\nR\u03b1\n\n=\n\nR\u03a9\n\n=\n\n\u03b1o R\u2299\n,\n\u03b7o\n2\n\u03a9o R\u2299\n,\n\u03b7o\n\n(9)\n(10)\n\nwhere \u03b1o and \u03b7o are reference values for the \u03b1-effect and the\ndiffusivity in the convective zone (CZ), respectively. And\n\u03a9o is the characteristic value of the differential rotation.\nThe quantities R\u03b1 and R\u03a9 are dynamo numbers measuring\nthe relative importance of inductive versus diffusive effects.\nMore discussion about R\u03a9 will be given in Subsection 2.2.\n\nFigure 1. Radial distributions of solar rotation at different latitudes. There are strong radial shear in the high latitude of the\ntachocline. At 35\u25e6 latitude, the shear is very weak (dashed line).\n\n2.2\n\nInternal rotation \u03a9(r, \u03b8)\n\nBased on the helioseismic inversion (Schou et al. 1998;\nCharbonneau et al. 1999), there are two strong radial shear\nregions inside of the Sun. One is in the tachocline and the\nother locates in sub-photospheric layer. For the sake of simplicity on computational solutions, We neglect the shear at\nthe sub-surface and regard that the dynamo works in the\ntachocline. The following expression for the solar interior\nrotation is adopted.\n\u03a9(r, \u03b8) = \u03a9c +\n\n1\nr \u2212 rc\n[1 + erf (2\n)](\u03a9s (\u03b8) \u2212 \u03a9c ),\n2\nd\n\n(11)\n\nwhere \u03a9s (\u03b8) = \u03a9EQ + a2 cos2 \u03b8 + a4 cos4 \u03b8 is the surface latitudinal rotation and \u03b8 is co-latitude. The parametric values\nare set as rc = 0.7R\u2299 , d = 0.05R\u2299 , \u03a9c /2\u03c0 = 430.0 nHz,\n\u03a9EQ /2\u03c0 = 455.8 nHz, a2 /2\u03c0 = \u221251.2 nHz, a4 /2\u03c0 = \u221284.0\nnHz. Fig. 1 shows the radial distribution of \u03a9(r, \u03b8) at different latitudes. It reveals that \u03a9 depends weakly on depth in\nbulk of CZ. But in the tachocline, the rotation rate changes\nfrom almost uniform in the radiative interior to depth dependent in the CZ. Within the tachocline, rotation increases\nwith distance from the core at low latitudes, while it decreases at high latitudes. At intermediate latitudes (near\n35\u25e6 , dashed line in Fig. 1) rotation is almost independent\non the depth.\nFurthermore, we base our model on the rotating spherical systems with the rotation velocity \u03a9c of the inner core.\nThus the differential rotation in the rotating frame \u03a9c is\n\u03a9\u2032 (r, \u03b8)\n\n=\n\n1\nr \u2212 rc\n[1 + erf (2\n)](2\u03c0 \u00d7 25.8) \u00d7\n2\nd\n2\n(1. \u2212 1.98 cos \u03b8 \u2212 3.26 cos4 \u03b8) (nHz).\n\n(12)\n\nThe differential rotation of the surface at the equator is (2\u03c0\u00d7\n25.8) nHz and we regard it as the characteristic value of the\ndifferential rotation \u03a9o in Eq. (10). Hence, the value of R\u03a9\n10\n2 \u22121\nis adopted as 8 \u00d7 10 \u03b7o m s , which is only decided by the\nreference value of the diffusivity \u03b7o .\n2.3\n\nThe diffusivity profile \u03b7(r)\n\nWe use the analytical expression of Dikpati & Charbonneau\n(1999) for the diffusivity profile as\n\u03b7(r) = \u03b7c +\n\n\u03b7o\nr \u2212 rc\n[1 + erf (2\n)],\n2\nd\n\n(13)\n\n\fNon-axisymmetric solar dynamo\n[h(r, \u03b8, \u03c6, t), g(r, \u03b8, \u03c6, t)] = [h(r, \u03b8, \u03c6), g(r, \u03b8, \u03c6)]est ,\n\nFigure 2.

Values of y-axis are not scaled.\n\n2.4\n\nThe \u03b1-effect \u03b1(r, \u03b8)\n\nThe \u03b1-effect cannot yet be determined from observations.\nThe dominated physical mechanisms responsible for it can\nbe categorized as the following three types. (1) It works\nat the surface produced by the decaying of active regions\n(Babcock 1961; Leighton 1969). (2) It is directly related\nto turbulent convective motions (Parker 1955). It exists\nthroughout the whole CZ and changes sign near the bottom of the CZ (Krivodubskii 1998; Kuzanyan et al. 2003).\n(3) It works at the tachocline induced by the hydrodynamical shear instabilities (Dikpati et al. 2001) or MHD instabilities (Thelen 2000). It is possible that all of them work\nsimultaneously inside of the Sun. Here, we only consider the\n\u03b1-effect concentrating in the tachocline with the following\nexpression\n\u03b1(r, \u03b8)\n\n=\n\n\u03b1o\n\nr \u2212 r1\n1\n[1 + erf (2\n)]\n2\nd\n1\nr \u2212 r2\n[1 \u2212 erf (2\n)] cos \u03b8,\n2\nd\n\n(14)\n\nwhere r1 = 0.675R\u2299 , r2 = 0.725R\u2299 . The solid line in Fig. 2\nshows the variation of \u03b1(r, \u03b8) with r, which is mainly concentrated in the tachocline. The common angular dependence\ncos \u03b8 is adopted, the simplest guaranteeing antisymmetry\nacross the equator. Moreover, we do not consider the \u03b1quenching since only the linear solutions are sought.\n\n2.5\n\nThe numerical scheme\n\nSince the governing equations (3) and (4) are two coupled,\nlinear homogeneous equations in h and g, with the given\nboundary conditions, we can look for their eigensolutions\nwith the form\n\n(15)\n\nwhere s is the eigenvalue and can be written as s = \u03c3 + i\u03c9.\nOnly the solution that neither grows nor decays (\u03c3 \u2243 0),\ni.e. the onset of dynamo actions is considered. The corresponding R\u03b1 is the critical R\u03b1 . The solution with the lowest\ndynamo number is the easiest to excite and is the most stable one. In what immediately follows, we solve the dynamo\nequations numerically using spectral (Chebyshev-\u03c4 ) method\n(see Jiang & Wang 2006 for detail).\nDifferent azimuthal modes m are decoupled in linear\ntheory. For given m, we expand h and g at the onset of the\ndynamo action in terms of Chebyshev polynomial Tn (r) and\nsurface harmonics Plm eim\u03c6 in the meridional circular sector\nr \u2208 [0.6, 1.0], \u03b8 \u2208 [0.0, \u03c0] as follows:\nh=\n\nwhose distribution can be seen in Fig. 2 (dashed line). The\ndiffusivity \u03b7o in CZ, is dominated by the turbulence. In\nthe stably stratified core, the diffusivity \u03b7c is much lower\nbecause of the much less turbulence. In what follows we\ntake \u03b7c /\u03b7o =0.01. The transition from high to low diffusivity occurs near the tachocline, which is coincident with the\nrotational shear layer. Here, \u03b7o is far less definite and is\nwidely known to fall in the range from 2 \u00d7 1010 cm2 s\u22121 to\n2 \u00d7 1012 cm2 s\u22121 .\n\n3\n\nN\nL\nX\nX\n\nchn,l Tn (ar \u2212 b)Plm (cos \u03b8)eim\u03c6 ,\n\n(16)\n\ncgn,l Tn (ar \u2212 b)Plm (cos \u03b8)eim\u03c6 ,\n\n(17)\n\nn=0 l=m\n\ng=\n\nN\nL\nX\nX\nn=0 l=m\n\nwhere ar \u2212 b \u2208 [\u22121, +1].

The exterior r > 1.0 is a vacuum and eigensolutions are matched to a potential field. The radiative core is\nassumed to behave as a perfect conductor.

(3) and (4) may be decomposed into two\nsubsystems, i.e. odd or even parity with respect to the\nequatorial plane. We denote them by A and S. With the\nparameters adopted in our model, both odd and even\nparity solutions have nearly the same dynamo number\nfor given mode m. Therefore, we cannot decide which\nkind of symmetric solution is excited easier. However, according to the observations and theoretical computations\n(Moss 2004; Fluri & Berdyugina 2004), the dipolar mode\n(A0) for axisymmetric field and the perpendicular dipolar mode (S1) for non-axisymmetric field are definitely\nidentified on the Sun although there are some possibilities\nfor some other non-axisymmetric modes exist on the Sun\n(De Toma, White & Harvey 2000; Song & Wang 2005).\nHence we will only choose the two modes A0 and S1 as\nthe representatives of axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric\nmodes, respectively and investigate A0 and S1 in detail below. We firstly discuss the difference between the \u03b12 \u2212 \u03a9\n\n\f4\n\nJ. Jiang and J. X. Wang\n\nFigure 3. A critical R\u03b1 -R\u03a9 plot for the \u03b1 \u2212 \u03a9 (solid line) and\nthe \u03b12 \u2212 \u03a9 (dashed line) models for the axisymmetric mode A0.\nWhen R\u03a9 6 3 \u00d7 103 , the \u03b1 \u2212 \u03a9 model has larger critical R\u03b1 than\nthe \u03b12 \u2212 \u03a9 one. When R\u03a9 > 3 \u00d7 103 , the two models have the\nnearly same critical R\u03b1 . For the \u03b1 \u2212 \u03a9 model, R\u03b1 R\u03a9 is about\n3840.\n\nFigure 4. The ratio of the magnetic energy between the toroidal\nand poloidal components vs. R\u03a9 for the \u03b1 \u2212 \u03a9 (solid line) and\nthe \u03b12 \u2212 \u03a9 (dashed line) models for the mode A0.\n\nand \u03b1 \u2212 \u03a9 models and then give the condition for the Sun\nto excite the preferred non-axisymmetric mode.\n\nFigure 5. A critical R\u03b1 -R\u03a9 plot for the \u03b12 \u2212 \u03a9 model with the\nmodes A0 (solid line) and S1 (dashed line). When R\u03a9 6 3 \u00d7 103 ,\nthe mode S1 has smaller R\u03b1 . It is contrary for R\u03a9 > 3 \u00d7 103 that\nthe mode A0 owns smaller R\u03b1 .\n\nmore complicated with the generation of toroidal field by\nthe \u03b1-effect (the dashed line in Fig.3). Comparing the two\nlines of Fig. 3, we can see that for the \u03b12 \u2212\u03a9 model, dynamo\naction is increased contrasting with the \u03b1 \u2212 \u03a9 model by the\nreduction of the critical R\u03b1 when R\u03a9 is small (< 3 \u00d7 103 ).\nWith the increasing of R\u03a9 , the difference for the corresponding critical R\u03b1 between the two models decreases. When\nR\u03a9 = 3\u00d7103 , the agreement between the two models reaches\nthe level of 0.3%.\nSince the absolute scale for the strength of magnetic\nfield is undermined by linear eigenvalues calculations, we\ndefine the ratio of the magnetic energy between the toroidal\nand poloidal components as (Charbonneau & Macgregor\n2001):\n\nR 2\nBT dV\nR\n,\n\u0398=\n2\nBP dV\n\nwhere BT = \u2212\u2202g/\u2202\u03b8 \u00ea\u03c6 and BP =\n3\n\n2\n\nTHE \u03b1 \u2212 \u03a9 DYNAMO MODEL VERSUS THE\n\u03b1 \u2212 \u03a9 ONE\n\nFor the mean field dynamo theory, poloidal field is created\nfrom toroidal field by the \u03b1-effect and toroidal field from\npoloidal field by two ways, i.e. the differential rotation (\u03a9effect) and \u03b1-effect. The model including all the ingredients\n2\nis called the \u03b12 \u2212 \u03a9 model. When R\u03a9 \u226b R\u03b1\n, the \u03b1-effect\nas the toroidal source can be ignored. The \u03b1 \u2212 \u03a9 model is\nalways adopted (Zeldovich et al. 1983). Is the simple \u03b1 \u2212 \u03a9\nmodel fine for the Sun? What quantitative conditions does\nit need to satisfy? What are the definite differences between\nthe two models with solar-like parameters?\nWe first discuss them based on the axisymmetric mode\nA0 and enlarge the range of \u03b7o from 8 \u00d7 1010 cm2 s\u22121 to\n8 \u00d7 1012 cm2 s\u22121 . Thus we obtain R\u03a9 ranging from 102 to\n104 . For the \u03b1 \u2212 \u03a9 model, the condition for the generation of\nundamped magnetic field is only determined by D = R\u03b1 R\u03a9\n(Ivanova & Ruzmaikin 1985). Accordingly we obtain the\nstraight (solid) line in Fig. 3 with logarithmic abscissa and\nD = R\u03b1 R\u03a9 is about 3840. But for the \u03b12 \u2212 \u03a9 model, it is\n\n(22)\n1 \u2202h\nL2 h\n\u00ear + (\n+\nr\nr \u2202\u03b8\n\n\u22022h\n) \u00ea\u03b8 for the axisymmetric model. Fig. 4 gives the en\u2202r\u2202\u03b8\nergy ratios between the toroidal and poloidal fields at the\nonset state for the two models with different R\u03a9 . When R\u03a9\nis less than 3\u00d7103 , the \u03b1\u2212\u03a9 model produces smaller ET /EP\nthan the \u03b12 \u2212 \u03a9 model. The larger R\u03a9 is, the less difference\nthe two models have. The agreement between the two models reaches 0.46% with R\u03a9 = 3 \u00d7 103 . When R\u03a9 > 3 \u00d7 103 ,\nthe energy ratios are closely in conformity with each other.\nThus we can replace the \u03b12 \u2212 \u03a9 model by the \u03b1 \u2212 \u03a9 model\nand the corresponding turbulent diffusivity \u03b7o should be less\nthan 2.67 \u00d7 1011 cm2 s\u22121 .\nLet us see the non-axisymmetric mode S1 simply now.\nTable 1 gives the difference for the two models with different R\u03a9 . When R\u03a9 > 4 \u00d7 103 (\u03b7o < 2 \u00d7 1011 cm2 s\u22121 ), the\ndifference between the two kinds of models is 0.73% and the\ntwo models can be regarded as the same. In a word, if the\nnon-axisymmetric mode m = 1 is considered in the model,\nit is necessary for R\u03a9 to be larger than 4000, namely \u03b7o is\nless than 2 \u00d7 1011 cm2 s\u22121 so that the \u03b1 \u2212 \u03a9 model is at the\nlimit of \u03b12 \u2212 \u03a9 model. It is fully reasonable to adopt the\n\u03b1 \u2212 \u03a9 model to replace the \u03b12 \u2212 \u03a9 one.\n\n\fNon-axisymmetric solar dynamo\n\n5\n\nTable 1.

Without\nit, all single main-sequence stars with outer CZs have the\nnon-axisymmetric field configurations (R\u00fcdiger & Elstner\n1994). The non-uniform rotation produces the observed\ndominant oscillatory dipolar field on the Sun. However, is\nthe differential rotation expressed by Eq. (12) is enough to\nproduce the dominant axisymmetric field? What condition\ndoes it need to satisfy to make the non-axisymmetric mode\npreferred?\nWith the given rotation profile (12) of the Sun, we\nrange R\u03a9 from 500 to 8000. Accordingly, \u03b7o changes from\n1.0 \u00d7 1011 cm2 s\u22121 to 1.6 \u00d7 1012 cm2 s\u22121 . Fig. 5 displays the\ncritical R\u03b1 with different R\u03a9 for the \u03b12 \u2212 \u03a9 model. The axisymmetric mode A0 (solid line) has lower critical R\u03b1 when\nR\u03a9 > 3000 and will be preferred to excite. It is contrary\nfor R\u03a9 < 3000 that the non-axisymmetric mode S1 will\nhave lower critical R\u03b1 and will be the preferred mode. The\nsmaller R\u03a9 is, the easier S1 is excited. According to Sec. 3,\nit is not at the \u03b1 \u2212 \u03a9 limit (R\u03a9 < 3000) when S1 is the\npreferred mode. In other words, it is impossible to favor the\nnon-axisymmetric mode at the \u03b1 \u2212 \u03a9 limit. To get the preferred non-axisymmetric modes, the contribution of \u03b1-effect\nto generation of the toroidal field cannot completely vanish (R\u00e4dler 1986a). The farther it deviates from the limit,\nthe more important roles the \u03b1-effect plays to produce the\ntoroidal field and the easier the non-axisymmetric mode to\nexcite. This is also consistent with the analytical results of\nBassom et al. (2005). Furthermore, they gave the reason that\nthe wind-up of non-axisymmetric structures can be compensated by phase mixing inherent to the \u03b12 \u2212 \u03a9 dynamo.\nMoreover, rather than the differential rotation, R\u03a9 is\nthe decisive parameter to decide which kind of mode is preferred. We may also say that the turbulent diffusivity \u03b7o is\nthe key parameter since the differential rotation has been basically determined by the observation (Jiang & Wang 2007).\nFor the \u03b12 \u2212 \u03a9 model, when R\u03a9 < 3000, i.e. \u03b7o > 2.67 \u00d7\n1011 cm2 s\u22121 the non-axisymmetric mode will be preferred.\nIn the coming two sections, we will take the \u03b12 \u2212 \u03a9\nmodel with \u03b7o =1.6 \u00d7 1011 cm2 s\u22121 and R\u03a9 =5000 so that the\naxisymmetric mode will be preferred. This is the real picture\nof the Sun.\n\n5\n\nTHE AXISYMMETRIC MODE\n\nLeft part of Table 2 is the truncation levels in the calculation of axisymmetric mode A0 and the corresponding\ncritical R\u03b1 and frequency \u03c9. N is the radial harmonics\n\nFigure 6. Butterfly diagram of the toroidal field B\u03c6 for the mode\nA0 at the depth r = 0.7R\u2299 (left) and Br at the surface r = R\u2299\n(right). Solid (dashed) contours correspond to positive (negative)\nmagnetic field. The diffusion time R\u2299 /\u03b7o is taken as the time\nunit.\n\nFigure 7. Evolution of the toroidal magnetic field in a meridional\nplane \u03c6 = 0 separated by 1/6th of the dynamo period T for\nthe axisymmetric mode A0. Solid (dashed) contours correspond\nto positive (negative) toroidal field. The dot-dashed lines locate\nat 0.7R\u2299 . The fields concentrate in the tachocline and the high\nlatitudes where the radial shear is strong.\n\nexpanded in terms of Chebyshev function and L is the\nharmonics in Legendre function (see Eqs.(16)(17)). When\nN = 38 and L = 50, it gets convergence. The critical R\u03b1\nis 0.765 and frequency \u03c9 is \u00b1410.37. With the dimension2\nless time t = R\u2299\n/\u03b7o , we obtain the period is about 15\n\n\f6\n\nJ. Jiang and J. X. Wang\n\nyear, which is a bit shorter than the 22-years solar magnetic cycle. In fact, the meridional circulation omitted in\nthe paper plays an important role in determining the true\ncycle (Dikpati & Charbonneau 1999). The symbol '\u00b1' corresponds to the dynamo wave propagating equatorward or\npoleward.\nFig. 6 (left) displays the toroidal field at r = 0.7R\u2299 with\n\u03c9 = +410.37. The magnetic field concentrates in the region\nfrom latitude 45\u25e6 to 70\u25e6 with strong radial shear \u2202\u03a9/\u2202r < 0\nthere. It is well-known that, without meridional circulation,\nthe propagation direction of the dynamo wave is decided by\nthe Parker-Yoshimura sign rule and it should be equatorward since the product of the \u03b1-effect and radial gradient of\ndifferential rotation is negative (Parker 1955; Yoshimura\n1975). The solution with \u03c9 = \u2212410.37 corresponds to the\ndynamo wave propagating poleward. Although some highfrequency dynamo waves were identified to propagate poleward on the Sun (Makarov 1989; Obridko et al. 2006), the\npoleward solution obtained in our method cannot be used\nto explain these observations. It is beyond the limitation\nof our method. Hence, the poleward solution is meaningless\nand should be neglected. Fig. 6 (right) is a time-latitude\ndiagram of the radial field at the surface. The phase shift\nbetween the two components is near \u03c0/2 which is consistent\nwith the observations (Sheeley 1991).\nFig. 7 is the evolution of the toroidal field in a meridional plane \u03c6 = 0 at an interval of 1/6th of solar cycle period.\nThe dot-dashed line is 0.7R\u2299 . The magnetic field is among\nthe region where the radial shear of differential rotation is\nstrong, i.e. the high latitude of the tachocline. This follows\nthe general rule that differential rotation tends to destroy\nany deviation from axisymmetry and toroidal field favors to\nbe produced in the strong radial shear region (Moffatt 1978;\nBigazzi & Ruzmaikin 2004).\nIt seems that the location of the toroidal field produced in the model is higher than that of the observation. Furthermore, when the toroidal flux rope rises\nthrough the CZ to emerge, it will have the poleward\ndeflection further due to the effect of Coriolis force\n(Caligari, Moreno-Insertis, Sch\u00fcssler 1995). But in the\nmodel, we omit an important ingredient, i.e. the meridional\ncirculation. If a meridional circulation is considered, the\nstrong field produced within the tachocline at high latitude\nwill be carried to the low latitudes. The toroidal flux entering\nthe CZ will become buoyantly unstable and emerge to form\nthe active regions at the low latitudes (Nandy & choudhuri\n2002).\n\n6\n\nTHE NON-AXISYMMETRIC MODE\n\nRight part of Table 2 is the truncation levels of the mode\nS1. When N = 28 and L = 70, it gets convergence, which\nis slower than the calculation for the axisymmetric one.\nThe critical R\u03b1 is 1.203, much larger than that for the axisymmetric mode. Therefore with taking R\u03a9 = 5000 and\n\u03b7o = 1.6 \u00d7 1011 cm2 s\u22121 , the axisymmetric mode will be\npreferred. Fig. 8 is the near surface distribution of the radial magnetic field for the mode S1 at the fixed time. The\ntoroidal magnetic field of the mode m = 1 superimposed on\nthe axisymmetric toroidal field produces a localized maximum ('hump'). The non-axisymmetric enhancement of the\n\nFigure 8. Near surface distribution of the radial component for\nthe mode S1 at a fixed time. Solid (dashed) contours correspond\nto positive (negative) magnetic field.\n\nunderlying magnetic field causes the clustering of sunspots\nto form 'active longitudes' (Ruzmaikin 2001) and 'Flip-flop'\nwhich behaves as a special phenomenon of 'active longitudes'.\nThe frequency \u03c9 is -1.022. Hence its period is nearly\n400 times longer than that of the mode A0. Thus the\nnon-axisymmetric mode S1 appears to be rather steady or\nweakly oscillating comparing to the axisymmetric mode A0\n(Berdyugina 2004). The time variations of the mode A0\nare periodical. By changing the sign of the mode A0, the\npredominant longitude jumps by about 180\u25e6 , which is just\nthe flip-flop phenomenon (see the details of Sec. 3 of Fluri\n& Berdyugina (2004)). But only based on these two modes,\nthe full flip-flop cycle has the same length as the A0 cycle\nrather than the value which is a 3-4 times shorter (about 3.7\nyears for the Sun) than the main activity cycle (Berdyugina\n2004). There should have more complicated field configuration working on the Sun.\nBoth the non-axisymmetric and axisymmetric magnetic fields are generated by the same axisymmetric\nsources. They evolve independently on each other in linear theory. In fact, some nonlinearities, such as nonaxisymmetric \u03b1-effect (Bigazzi & Ruzmaikin 2004), MHD\ninstability (Dikpati & Gilman 2005), magnetic buoyancy\n(Chatterjee et al. 2004) and the \u03b1-quenching (Zhang et al.\n2003; Moss 2005) induce the different modes coupled together and produce the flip-flop cycle (Moss 2004).\nLeft of Fig. 9 shows the contours of toroidal magnetic\nfield in a meridional plane. All the fields concentrate in the\nlower part of the tachocline where the diffusivity is less than\nthat of other regions (see Fig. 2). Right of Fig. 9 displays\nthe butterfly diagram for the mode S1 at the depth r =\n0.75R\u2299 . The field is mainly concentrated around the 35\u25e6\nlatitude, where the radial shear is weak (see Fig. 1). This\nis consistent with the work of Bigazzi & Ruzmaikin (2004)\nthat the non-axisymmetric field survives only in the weak\ndifferential rotation and low diffusivity region.\n\n7\n\nDISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this paper we have investigated the properties of the\naxisymmetric and the non-axisymmetric modes with a linear \u03b12 \u2212 \u03a9 model in a rotating frame trying to understand\n\n\fNon-axisymmetric solar dynamo\n\n7\n\nTable 2.

Because the differential rotation affects\naxisymmetric and non-axisymmetric magnetic fields in the\ndifferent ways, the two kinds of fields prefer to occur in different regions. The axisymmetric magnetic field is mainly concentrated near the high latitude (about 55\u25e6 ) around 0.7R\u2299 ,\nwhere the radial shear of differential rotation is strong. However, the non-axisymmetric field occurs near the intermediate 35\u25e6 latitude in the bottom of the tachocline, where the\ndifferential rotation is weak and the diffusivity is low.\n\nFigure 9. Contours of the toroidal field B\u03c6 in a meridional plane\n(left) and Butterfly diagram of the toroidal field at the depth\nr = 0.75R\u2299 (right) for the mode S1. The field concentrates in\nthe low diffusivity (below the dot-dashed line 0.7R\u2299 in the left\ndiagram) and weak differential rotation (about the latitude 35\u25e6\nin the right diagram) region. Solid (dashed) contours correspond\nto positive (negative) magnetic field.\n\nthe active longitudes, flip-flops and other non-axisymmetric\nphenomena. The model consists of updated differential rotation, turbulent diffusivity varied with depth and the \u03b1-effect\nworking in the tachocline. The definite differences between\nthe \u03b1\u2212\u03a9 and \u03b12 \u2212\u03a9 models and the conditions to excite the\nnon-axisymmetric modes with the solar-like parameters are\npresented. The Chebyshev-\u03c4 method is used to numerically\nsolve the problem with a high precision. We have tested this\ncode with the analytical solutions of a simple \u03b12 model and\ncompared with the results of Stix (1976). They matched well\nwith each other.\nAlthough the conditions to favor the non-axisymmetric\nmodes have been investigated by some works (R\u00e4dler\n1986a,b; Bassom, Kuzanyan, Sokoloff, Soward 2005), we\nare the first to apply the updated solar parameters with\nnumerical method to obtain these. We also point out the\nrole of the turbulent diffusivity \u03b7o during the process. It is\npoorly known and cannot be directly deduced from observations. When it is lower than 2.0 \u00d7 1011 cm2 s\u22121 and R\u03a9\nis larger than 4000 accordingly, the \u03b1 \u2212 \u03a9 model is at the\nlimit of the \u03b12 \u2212 \u03a9 model. Furthermore, based on the \u03b12 \u2212 \u03a9\nmodel, when R\u03b1 is lower than 3000, the non-axisymmetric\nmode m = 1 will be more and more easily excited than\nthe axisymmetric mode m = 0 when increasing the value of\ndiffusivity \u03b7o and decreasing the corresponding R\u03a9 .\nThe non-axisymmetric mode S1 has much longer period\nthan the axisymmetric one A0. The co-existence of oscillat-\n\nUsoskin et al. (2005) gave that the ratio between the\nnon-axisymmetric strength and the axisymmetric one is\nroughly 1:10 by analyzing sunspot group data for the past\n120 years. Based on the non-linear models, Moss (1999,\n2004) presented the energy ratios between the two kinds of\nmodes although the values cannot match well with the observation. Since our model is linear and different modes are\ndecoupled, it is the limitation to provide the energy ratios\nbetween the two modes.\nIn this work, we regard the strong radial shear only\nexists in the tachocline and omit the sub-surface shear\nand other details of the distribution of differential rotation.\nBrandenburg (2005) argued for the alternative ideas concerning dynamo operating in the bulk of CZ, or perhaps\neven in the sub-surface shear layer. Moreover, we also only\ntake the \u03b1-effect working in the tachocline and ignore the\nother two possible mechanisms. The two generation sources\nare still the hot topics on debate. Since we do not aim to\ngive the detailed description of the Sun and just put emphasis on the basic characters of the axisymmetric and nonaxisymmetric modes, it is feasible for us to take the two\nsimple generation sources and set up the thin-layer dynamo\nmodel. Of course, more rich and realistic models can open\nnew option for the understanding of solar magnetic field.\nFurthermore, since we tried to expatiate on our objectives with the simple generation sources, the meridional circulation is not considered in the work. It plays an important role in the axisymmetric mode (Nandy & choudhuri\n2002; Guerrero & Mu\u00f1oz 2004). It carries the strong axisymmetric toroidal field produced at the high latitudes to\nthe low ones and produces the active regions there with the\nmagnetic buoyancy. But it has no much influence on the\nnon-axisymmetric field according to the work of Bigazzi &\nRuzmaikin (2004).\nIn the forthcoming studies we will include the nonlinearities and the meridional circulation to investigate the influence on the coupling of the different modes and the role\nof meridional circulation in the non-axisymmetric dynamo.\n\n\f8\n\nJ.
