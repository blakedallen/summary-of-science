Future papers in this series will address the distribution of galactic environments associated with metal-line systems and the Ly\u03b1 forest based on data for over 10 additional fields. All of the\ndata presented in this paper is made public at a dedicated web site.\nSubject headings: quasars : absorption lines\nof sight (Impey, Petry, & Flint 1999; Penton, Stocke, &\nShull 2002, 2004). Together these results show that on\nlarge-scales (\u223c 1 Mpc) strong Ly\u03b1 absorbers are not distributed randomly with respect to known galaxies, while\nweak absorbers are, exhibiting little/no trace of large-scale\ngalactic structure (see also Grogin & Geller 1998; Tripp\net al. 1998; Bowen, Pettini, & Blades 2002; Chen et al.\n2005).\nIn addition, comprehensive surveys of galaxies and metalline absorbers along common lines of sight have examined\nthe correlation between galaxies and C IV systems with\nrest equivalent width W\u03bb & 0.3\u00c5 (Chen, Lanzetta, &\nWebb 2001). Chen, Lanzetta, & Webb (2001) showed\nthat nearly all galaxies found at impact parameter \u03c1 \u2264\n100h\u22121 kpc show associated C IV absorption while those\nat larger \u03c1 rarely do. The authors interpreted this signature as a metal-enriched gaseous envelope surrounding\ngalaxies, i.e. the absorption is galactic as opposed to intergalactic. This interpretation was further supported by an\napparent correlation between the galaxy luminosity and\nC IV equivalent width. It is worth noting that Adelberger\net al. (2003) have reported a similar correlation between\nC IV absorption and luminous Lyman break galaxies at\nz \u223c 3. Furthermore, they describe a 'halo' with physical radius \u03c1 \u2248 125 kpc (perhaps the result of starburst\nwinds) in good agreement with the Chen, Lanzetta, &\nWebb (2001) result. It remains an open question as to\nwhether this pair of results are a coincidence, a generic\ncharacteristic of luminous galaxies, or even an indication\nof passive evolution in galactic halos from z = 3 to low\nredshift.\nMore recently, high resolution spectroscopy carried out\nat mid- and far-ultraviolet wavelengths using the Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE) and the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) on board HST has offered a unique avenue to study highly ionized gas at low\nredshifts based on observations of O VI \u03bb\u03bb1031,1037 (e.g.\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\nSince the discovery of quasar absorption line (QAL) systems, establishing and defining their relationship to known\ngalaxies has been a central area of research. Unfortunately, this pursuit has been hampered by a number of\nfactors. The majority of QAL systems are identified in\noptical quasar spectra at z > 2 where galaxies have very\nfaint apparent magnitudes. Furthermore, the glare of the\nbackground quasar prohibits imaging and spectroscopy at\nsmall angular radii. At z & 1, authors have had modest\nsuccess by studying Mg II absorbers, metal-line systems\nselected by the doublet feature at rest-frame wavelengths\n\u03bb = 2796 and 2803 \u00c5 that are observable to redshift as\nlow as z = 0.2 in optical spectroscopic surveys. The few\nstudies to date associate the strongest systems with the\nhalos of \u2248 L\u2217 galaxies at z \u223c 1 (Bergeron 1988; Lanzetta\n1993; Steidel 1993). Even at these redshifts, however, it\nis difficult to conduct large surveys to sub-L\u2217 luminosity\nto trace the galactic environment of this specific class of\nQAL systems.\nWith the advance of UV spectroscopy on space-borne facilities, such as the Hubble Space Telescope, QAL studies\nhave been carried out on a growing sample of low redshift\nAGN and quasars. To date, the majority of studies at\nz < 1 have focused on the nature of strong Ly\u03b1-forest absorbers of neutral hydrogen column density log NHI \u2265 14\n(e.g. Morris et al. 1993; Lanzetta et al. 1996; Jannuzi et\nal. 1998) and some authors have also pushed the study to\nweak absorbers of log NHI = 12 \u2212 13.5 along several lines\n1 UCO/Lick Observatory; University of California, Santa Cruz;\nSanta Cruz, CA 95064; xavier@ucolick.org\n2 Department of Astronomy; University of Maryland; College\nPark, MD 20742-2421; bjw@astro.umd.edu\n3 Department of Astronomy; University of Chicago; 5640 S.

The results show\nthat O VI absorbers are correlated with large-scale galaxy\ndistributions, but there is no clear evidence to support an\nimmediate connection to individual galactic halos.\nIn this paper, we present optical spectra for \u223c 500 objects in the field surrounding the quasar PKS0405\u2212123. In\nPaper I (Prochaska et al. 2004), we analyzed the UV spectroscopy of this sightline obtained with FUSE and STIS.\nWe focused primarily on the metal-line systems toward\nPKS0405\u2212123, their ionization state and physical properties. In Paper II (Chen et al. 2005), we focused on\nthe cross-correlation between galaxies and the Ly\u03b1 forest\nalong the sightline (see also Williger et al. 2006). In this\npaper, we examine the galactic environment of metal-line\nsystems, a principal goal of the full survey. These systems\nare of particular interest at present, because the O VI transition provides the most efficient means of probing warmhot (T \u223c 105\u22127 K) ionized gas in the intergalactic medium5\n(the so-called WHIM; Tripp et al. 2000; Danforth & Shull\n2005). Numerical simulations of the low redshift universe\nsuggest the WHIM is a major reservoir of baryons, which\ncan be directly tested using the O VI absorbers (Cen &\nOstriker 1999; Dav\u00e9 et al. 2001). This paper represents\nour group's first step toward understanding the physical\nenvironment of low-redshift O VI systems.\nUnless otherwise indicated, all distances in this paper\nare physical separations derived from the angular diameter distance, assuming a \u039bCDM cosmology with \u03a9m =\n0.3, \u039b = 0.7, H0 = 75kms\u22121 Mpc\u22121 . The physical separation is most meaningful for gravitationally bound systems. To obtain transverse comoving separations, the\nphysical separation can be multiplied by (1+z). All dis\u22121\ntances quoted scale with h\u22121\nMpc\u22121 .\n75 with h75 = H0 /75kms\n2. PHOTOMETRY\n\nTo perform target selection for multi-slit spectroscopy,\nwe imaged the field surrounding PKS0405\u2013123 with the\nSwope 40\u2032\u2032 telescope at Las Campanas Observatory. Our\nfirst set of images were acquired on UT Oct 26, 2000 with\nthe SITe1 CCD in direct imaging mode (pixel size 0.6964\u2032\u2032\nfor the 2048x2048 array). These images were centered\non PKS0405\u2013123 and covered an \u2248 20\u2032 \u00d7 20\u2032 field-of-view\n(FOV). We obtained B and R images under photometric\n(but windy) conditions for total exposure times of 900s and\n350s respectively. We obtained multiple exposures with a\n10\u2032\u2032 dither patter to account for bad pixels and to facilitate\nthe construction of a super-sky flat.\nThe imaging data were reduced with standard IRAF\ntasks to subtract the overscan and bias, and to flatten\nthe images. We then used a set of custom routines to\ndetermine integer offsets between the images and combine\nthe individual frames weighting by signal-to-noise. Finally,\nwe derived a photometric solution (zero point, airmass,\nand color terms) on the Vega scale from standard star\nobservations taken throughout the night: BZP = 21.54 \u00b1\n5 At T > 105.5 K, O+6 and O+7 are the dominant ions in the\nWHIM (e.g. Chen et al. 2003), but these ions require X-ray observations and current instrumentation limits one to only a few sightlines.\n\n0.01; BAM = 0.24 \u00b1 0.01; RZP = 21.81 \u00b1 0.01; RAM =\n0.08 \u00b1 0.006; (B \u2212 R) = \u22120.03 \u00b1 0.002.

The printed edition contains only a sample.]\n\nObjects in the stacked R image were identified using\nSExtractor (v. 2.0 Bertin et al. 2002). We required a minimum detection area of 6 pixels and a detection threshold\nof 1.5\u03c3 above the sky RMS. We constructed segmentation maps (images which consist of those pixels associated\nwith each galaxy identified by SExtractor) and then calculated B and R magnitudes adopting the photometric\nsolution listed above and assigning the average airmass of\nthe combined images. We also used SExtractor to calculate a star/galaxy classifier which is one criterion of the\ntarget selection algorithm. Table 1 lists the RA, DEC, R\nmagnitude and error, the star/galaxy classifier, and the\narea in \u0003\u2032\u2032 for each object identified by SExtractor. Note\nthat a small fraction of these objects may be spurious (e.g.\nbad pixels).\nWe acquired additional R images of the field on the photometric nights of UT 2002 Oct 3 and 4 to expand the\nfield-of-view to \u2248 1\u0003\u25e6 . Unfortunately, owing to an error in coordinates, the area imaged is discontiguous. For\nthese observations, we used the SITe3 CCD in direct imaging mode (pixel=0.435\u2032\u2032 on this 2048x3150 array) and acquired multiple dithered exposures at each pointing.\nFor this set of observations, the images were processed\nwith a package of IDL routines developed by JXP for direct images6 . The algorithms are similar to standard IRAF\ntasks yet are tailored to this specific dataset. The routines\nperform overscan subtraction, the construction of a supersky flat, and the flattening of science exposures. We also\nused the package to derive a photometric solution for the\ntwo nights. Finally, offsets were determined for the individual exposures and the images were combined to create\na stacked image for each of four pointings.\n\n6 Publically available\n\nhttp://www.ucolick.org/\u223cxavier/IDL/index.html\n\n\fPROCHASKA ET AL.\n\n3\n\nbecause of its proximity to a very bright star which negatively affected its photometry and isophotal area.\n\n7\n\nArea (sqarcsec)\n\n6\n5\n40\n\n4\n\n30\n\n3\n\n20\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\nR (mag)\n\n19\n\n20\n\n21\n\nFig. 1.- Plot of the isophotal area (in square arcseconds) of all the\nobjects within 10\u2032 of PKS0405\u2013123 as a function of R magnitude.\nThe dashed line separates the targets we pre-selects as stars and\ngalaxies (stars are below the line).

TARGET SELECTION AND MASK DESIGN\n\nThe next task was to select objects from Table 1 for\nfollow-up spectroscopy with the WFCCD spectrograph on\nthe 100\u2032\u2032 Dupont telescope at Las Campanas Observatory.\nOur goal was to achieve > 90% completeness to R \u2248 20\nwithin a circle of 10\u2032 radius centered on PKS0405\u2013123 and\nthe same completeness to R \u2248 19.5 for the flanking fields.\nFor the central field, these observational parameters correspond to a luminosity L \u2248 0.1L\u2217 and radial field-of-view of\n1 Mpc at z = 0.1. These magnitude limits represent a compromise between surveying down the luminosity function\nand the sensitivity limit of the WFCCD spectrograph. To\ndistinguish stars from extragalactic sources, we examined\nthe area of the objects as a function of magnitude (Figure 1). Point sources should occupy a uniform locus at the\nbottom edge of the distribution and can be removed from\nthe target list accordingly. The line in Figure 1 represents\nour area-cut as a function of magnitude; objects below the\nline were discarded as stars with the exception of those\nobjects where the star/galaxy classifier from SExtractor\nis less than 0.98. This value was adopted by comparing\nthe full set of values against the results presented in Figure 1. Although the seeing was poorer for the imaging of\nthe flanking fields, the smaller pixel size gives more reliable\nstar/galaxy separation.\nThere are two problems with this procedure: (1) compact galaxies may be misidentified as stars; (2) galaxies\nand stars are not well separated at faint magnitudes. We\naddressed the latter concern by taking a very conservative\ncut at faint magnitudes. The former issue was investigated\nby observing a mask of objects drawn from beneath the\nline in Figure 1. Of the 34 targets observed, all were spectroscopically classified as stars. Nevertheless, we expect\nthat our survey has a few percent incompleteness due to\nthis target selection criterion, especially for objects fainter\nthan R = 19.5 mag. Finally, we inspected each target\ngalaxy to remove any erroneous objects from the SExtractor results. In a handful of cases, we removed an object\n\n\u221220\n\n\u221230\n\u221230\n\n\u221220\n\n\u221210\n0\n10\nRA (Relative Arcmin)\n\n20\n\n30\n\nFig. 2.- Sky position of the galaxies in the field surrounding\nPKS0405\u2013123 (marked by the 'x' at RA=DEC=0).

The circled objects do not have a measured redshift.\n\nIn Figure 2 we show positions of all the target galaxies\nfor the center and flanking fields. We designed 24 masks\ntargeting 549 objects in the full field. The masks were not\ndesigned such that the slits would be observed at the parallactic angle, but we used 1.5\u2032\u2032 wide slits and losses due to\natmospheric dispersion were not severe. The various point\nstyles in Figure 2 identify galaxies with several magnitude\nranges and the circles indicate objects with unknown redshifts. Table 1 also lists the redshift of each object and\nthe galaxy type as defined in the next section.\n4. WFCCD SPECTROSCOPY\n\n4.1. Observations\nAt the time we initiated this survey, the Dupont Wide\nField CCD camera (Weymann et al. 2001) was the largest\nfield-of-view multi-slit spectrometer on any telescope. Its\ncombination of field-of-view and throughput were essential to surveying galaxies over a large area to a sensitive luminosity limit. All of our observations were performed with brass slit masks milled at the observatory\nwith slits covering an approximately 20\u2032 \u00d715\u2032 field-of-view.\nWe employed the blue grism which has a dispersion of\nFWHM \u2248 375 km s\u22121 .\nWith few exceptions, we observed each mask for two exposures totaling 1hr of integration. In the first few years\n\n\fProbing the IGM/Galaxy Connection Toward PKS0405-123 III:\n\n4.2. Data Reduction Pipeline\nAll of the spectroscopic data were reduced and analyzed\nwith an IDL package specifically designed for the WFCCD\ninstrument. This subsection serves as the official release\nof the WFCCD reduction package7 and we will describe at\ngreater length its procedures (for recent modifications to\nthe package, see Geha & Blanton 2005 in prep.). Given a\nnight of data, the user creates an IDL structure which\ndescribes the key diagnostics of each image (e.g. filter,\nexposure time, UT, image type, mask ID). A fraction of\nthis information is parsed from the relatively sparse FITS\nheader of WFCCD data and the remainder is input by\nthe observer. After this initial step, the pipeline is fairly\nautomated and is guided by this data structure.\nThe steps of the data reduction for a given mask are\nas follows. The dome flat exposures are scaled and combined and cosmic rays are conservatively identified in cases\nwith multiple exposures. A sawtooth image of the flat is\ngenerated by differencing the image with itself after shifting it by a single row (spectra run parallel to the CCD\nrows). The resulting image exhibits a sawtooth pattern\nat each slit edge. Each slit edge then shows a sharp feature which is traced to determine the slit curvature and\nto construct a two-dimensional map of the y-distortion.\nThe y-distortion map is used to rectify (in the spatial direction only with the sole goal of mapping the wavelength\nsolution as noted below) the flat image and the slit edges\nare cross-correlated with the expected slit positions (determined from the output of the mask design software) to\ndetermine the true position of each slit. Finally, the flat\nfor each slit is normalized by the median of the central five\nrows in the original (i.e. curved) frame and a final image\nfor the normalization of pixel-to-pixel variations is created.\nThe pipeline then overscan subtracts and flattens the arc\nimages associated with the mask and rectifies the frames.\nA one-dimensional arc spectrum is extracted down the\nmiddle of each slit and a wavelength solution is automatically derived using the known spatial coordinates of\nthe slit as input. The dispersion of this grism spectrograph is non-linear and a 6th-order polynomial is required\nto achieve a fit with a typical RMS of 0.2 pixels. The\npipeline then traces the curvature of the arc lines within\neach slit and fits a low-order polynomial to each line. It\nthen generates a unique wavelength solution for each row\nin the slit, i.e. every pixel in the rectified arc image is assigned a unique wavelength. Lastly, this wavelength image\nis mapped back to the original data frame using the inverse\nof the y-distortion map.\n\nThe remainder of the data reduction is carried out on\nthe science images without rectification. Each exposure is\noverscan subtracted and flattened, a variance array is constructed assuming Poisson statistics and the read noise\n(5.6 electrons for gain=1), and the wavelength image of\nthe arc closest in UT is assigned to the exposure. If two or\nmore science exposures were obtained (without dithering\nalong the slits), cosmic rays are masked using a conservative algorithm to avoid mis-identifying sharp emission line\nfeatures. The pipeline then identifies all objects with significant flux in each slit. By default, the algorithm searches\nfor peaks in the flux along the slit at \u03bb = 5500\u00c5. If a peak\nis identified within 5 pixels of the expected position of\nthe science object, it is assigned as the primary object.\nIf no object is identified within 5 pixels of the expected\nposition, the program gives the primary object a centroid\ncorresponding to the expected position. Any additional\nobjects are flagged as serendipitous. The code then masks\nthe regions surrounding all identified objects and the centroids will be used as starting points for tracing and extraction. A GUI is launched to allow the user to verify\nobject identification and to modify the regions of the slit\nused to perform sky subtraction. The object centroids are\nsaved within an IDL structure for each science exposure.\n4\nF\u03bb (10\u221216 cgs)\n\nof operation, the WFCCD spectrometer suffered from significant flexure. Although the largest contribution to the\nflexure was fixed prior to our observations, we chose to\ntake a coeval set of flats and arc-line calibration frames\nfor each mask during the night, interleaved with the observations. The observations were carried out during two\nruns with the Dupont Telescope in Sep 2001 and Oct/Nov\n2002. With little exception the nights were photometric.\nWe used the TEK#5 CCD in each case.\nFor slits milled near the center of the mask, the spectral\ncoverage spans \u03bb = 3800 \u2212 9000\u00c5, with a spectral dispersion of 2\u00c5 pix\u22121 and a spatial scale of \u2248 0.75\u2032\u2032 pix\u22121 .\n\nID 1081\nz = 0.080\n\n3\n2\n1\n0\n\nF\u03bb (10\u221216 cgs)\n\n4\n\n2\n\nID 42801\nz = 0.184\n\n1\n\n0\n4000\n\n4500\n\n5000\n5500\nRest Wavelength (\u00c5)\n\n6000\n\n6500\n\nFig. 3.- Example galaxy spectra for two of the brighter galaxies\nin the survey.

The red line traces the 1\u03c3 error\narray.\n\nSky subtraction is performed by fitting those pixels within\na given slit that were not masked as object pixels. The\nwavelength and flux values for each unmasked pixel in the\nslit are used to estimate the sky spectrum. The values are\nfit with a third order b-spline with breakpoints centered\non every other column. The b-spline is then evaluated at\nevery pixel in the slit and subtracted. The routine iterates\nover all slits and the full sky subtracted image is appended\nto the processed data FITS file. Finally, the objects are\nextracted using boxcar extraction. The spatial profile is fit\nwith a spline and an aperture containing 95% of the flux is\ndefined. This profile is also used to flag cosmic rays within\nthe extraction window. These pixels are flagged and their\ncorresponding 1D spectral regions are masked (e.g. given\nzero weight). The 1D spectra of individual exposures is\nscaled and combined with optimal weighting.

Galaxy Redshifts, Completeness, and Selection\nFunctions\nAn initial redshift for every extracted object was calculated with an automated procedure based on the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey (SDSS) software routine zfind. We\nfirst smoothed and rebinned the four SDSS galaxy and\nstar eigenfunctions (EigenGal-52223, EigenStar-52374) to\nthe WFCCD resolution and wavelength range. We then\nimplemented a slightly modified version of zfind which allows for greater freedom in the continuum of the galaxy\ndue to poor fluxing of the WFCCD data (in particular\nthose galaxies grossly affected by vignetting). The algorithm steps from z = 0.05 to 0.5 in steps of the extracted\npixel width (100 km/s). At each step it fits a linear combination of the galaxy eigenfunctions to the pixel data and\nvariance by minimizing \u03c72 . It then finds the minimum of\nthe array of \u03c72 (z) and fits a curve to the array near the\nminimum to yield a redshift with formal 1 sigma uncertainty of \u223c 30km s\u22121 for the majority of spectra. We\nexpect that systematic uncertainty (e.g. limitations of the\neigenspectra) are smaller than the statistical error. Finally, the spectrum and best-fit were visually inspected by\ntwo authors and the redshift was corrected for \u2248 10% of\nthe objects. In these cases, we reapplied the automated\nalgorithm to find the minimum \u03c72 in a restricted redshift\ninterval. The redshift values are listed in column 8 of Table 1.\n\nthe primary objects in the sample. The solid bars are the\nhistograms for galaxies within 10\u2032 of PKS0405\u2013123 and the\nopen histogram shows the full sample. Overplotted on the\nhistograms is the selection functions for the survey (i.e. the\npredicted redshift distribution based on the survey limit;\nsee Paper II for details).\nIn Figure 5, we report the completeness of the survey as\na function of impact parameter for several magnitude limits. For the inner 10\u2032 the curves simply indicate the fraction of galaxies with measured redshifts that are brighter\nthan the magnitude limit. At larger impact parameter,\nwe use the observed surface density within the inner 10\u2032\nto predict the number of galaxies and calculate the ratio of\ngalaxies with measured redshift versus the predicted number of galaxies. Note that none of the calculations account\nfor a incompleteness due to our star/galaxy algorithm.

At radii greater\nthan 10\u2032 , the incompleteness is primarily due to the discontiguous\ncoverage of the flanking fields (Figure 2).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nIn this section we discuss the results of our galaxy survey in terms of the origin of low z metal-line systems. For\neach known metal-line absorber, we examine the luminosity range, projected distances, and number density of the\nsurrounding galaxies over a large volume to the magnitude limit defined in our redshift survey. This is different but complementary to the approach adopted by Chen,\nLanzetta, & Webb (2001), who investigated the presence/absence of metal absorbers for each known galaxy\nat small projected distance to the sightline.\n5.1. Individual Metal-Line Systems\nWe begin with a discussion of the galaxies associated\nwith each of the metal-line systems identified along the\nsightline to PKS0405\u2013123 (Paper I). We focus our attention on the galaxies with smallest impact parameters and\nalso any large-scale structures identified in our survey. Table 2 lists the properties of the galaxies identified with\n|\u03b4v| < 1000 km s\u22121 where\n\u03b4v \u2261 c\n\n(zabs \u2212 zgal )\n.\n(1 + zabs )\n\n(1)\n\nThis velocity limit is somewhat arbitrary. We chose the\nvalue because it characterizes the peculiar velocities of\n\ngalaxies in the largest, gravitationally bound structures.\nWe will, however, primarily focus on galaxies with |\u03b4v| <\n500 km s\u22121 which are more likely to be physically associated with the absorption systems. We do not impose a\nlimit to the impact parameter for this discussion, in part\nbecause we wish to consider the role of large-scale structures (e.g. filaments).\nFigure 7 presents a visual survey of the galactic environment of each absorber. For the metal-line systems,\nour galaxy survey covers from \u2248 3 to 10 physical Mpc in\nradius for z = 0.1 to 0.4. Therefore, the survey is not sensitive to very large-scale structures at z \u223c 0.1, although\nwe emphasize that environmental correlations with galactic properties appear to be dominated by the environment\nmeasured on 1 to 3 Mpc scales (e.g. Blanton et al. 2005).\nTable 2 also summarizes the physical properties of the\nmetal-line absorbers, each of which has NHI > 1014 cm\u22122 .\nFurthermore, all of the systems show O VI absorption except the absorber at z = 0.3608 where an O VI absorber is\nidentified8 nearby (\u03b4v = 550 km s\u22121 ). These O VI systems\nare particularly notable because they provide the most efficient means of probing the warm-hot intergalactic medium\n(WHIM; Tripp et al. 2000) with current instrumentation.\nNumerical simulations suggest that the WHIM is a major baryonic component of the low redshift universe (Cen\n& Ostriker 1999; Dav\u00e9 et al. 2001). They describe the\nWHIM as a low density gas with temperature T \u2248 105\u22127 K\nwhich has been shock heated during the formation of largescale filamentary structures. If this gas is metal-enriched,\nthen it would be detectable with UV spectroscopy via the\nO VI transition.\n5.1.1. z = 0.0918\nOf all the metal-line absorbers identified toward PKS0405\u2013\n123, the O VI system at z = 0.0918 shows the largest\nnumber of galaxies with |\u03b4v| < 500 km s\u22121 . It is also\nthe lowest redshift absorber and, therefore, we probe furthest down the luminosity function. Although one identifies 14 galaxies, only one of these has an impact parameter \u03c1 < 1 Mpc and even it lies at \u03c1 \u2248 400 kpc. This\nlow luminosity, emission-line galaxy has a velocity offset\n\u03b4v = \u2212340 km s\u22121 which is much larger than the virial velocity of the galaxy and a physical association is unlikely.\nThere are no additional galaxies to within 1 Mpc of the\nquasar sightline and we emphasize that the survey completeness is greater than 95% to R = 20 (L \u2248 L\u2217 /10) at\nthis impact parameter. It is unlikely, then, that this absorber is physically associated with a galactic halo. Examining Figure 7, one identifies three 'groups' of galaxies at\nz \u2248 0.091 roughly surrounding the quasar sightline. The\noverall impression is that this gas occurs near the intersection of several groups, perhaps related to an over-dense,\nlarge-scale structure (i.e. filament).\n5.1.2. z = 0.0965\nA strong case can made that this O VI absorber arises\nin an intragroup medium. First, the sightline penetrates\n8 Williger et al. (2006) also report the detection of an additional\nO VI system at z = 0.3616 (\u03b4v = 240 km s\u22121 ). We are not convinced\nof the identification based on our extraction of the STIS data and\ndo not consider it here. In any case, its existence does not bear\nsignificantly on our results.\n\n\fPROCHASKA ET AL.\n\n7\n\ny (Mpc)\n\n5\n0\n\u22125\n\nz= 0.0918\nNHI= 14.5\n\nz= 0.1671\nNHI= 16.5\n\nz= 0.3608\nNHI= 15.1\n\nz= 0.0965\nNHI= 14.6\n\nz= 0.1829\nNHI= 14.1\n\nz= 0.4951\nNHI= 14.4\n\ny (Mpc)\n\n5\n0\n\u22125\n\n\u22125\n\n0\nx (Mpc)\n\n5\n\n\u22125\n\n0\nx (Mpc)\n\n5\n\n\u22125\n\n0\nx (Mpc)\n\n5\n\nFig. 7.- Plot of the spatial distribution of galaxies around PKS0405\u2013123 for each of the metal-line absorption systems detected along the\nsightline. Galaxies are color-coded according to their velocity offset from the absorption system and circles indicate |\u03b4v| < 500 km s\u22121 and\ntriangles are for 1000 > |\u03b4v| > 500 km s\u22121 . The size of the symbol is proportional to the luminosity of the galaxy. The purple circle in the\nupper-left corner of each sub-panel corresponds to R = 20 mag, i.e. the magnitude limit of the inner 10\u2032 of the survey. This corresponds to\nL \u2248 L\u2217 /10 at z = 0.1 and L \u2248 L\u2217 at z = 0.25. The green circle in each sub-plot shows the approximate radial limit of the survey (36\u2032 ).\n\na galaxy group containing several L & L\u2217 galaxies, including three early-type galaxies. Restricting the analysis\nto the galaxies within 2.2 Mpc, the group has a velocity\ncentroid offset of 140 km s\u22121 from the gas and a velocity dispersion of 210km s\u22121 . Second, the galaxies with\n|\u03b4v| < 500 km s\u22121 surround the sightline and the gas must\nbe gravitationally bound to the group. Third, although\nthere are three galaxies with \u03c1 = 250 \u2212 350 kpc, these have\ntoo low luminosity for their virial radius to encompass the\nsightline. In short, it is more likely the intragroup medium\ngives rise to this O VI absorption system (Mulchaey et\nal. 1996; Fukugita et al. 1998). In Paper I we estimated the volume density for this gas nH \u2248 10\u22125 cm\u22123\nassuming the extragalactic ultraviolet background radiation field from Dav\u00e9 & Tripp (2001). The gas density profile of the intragroup medium can be estimated directly for\nX-ray detected groups from the X-ray surface brightness\nprofile. For an X-ray group with central volume density\nnH \u2248 10\u22123 cm\u22123 and a standard beta model (i.e. Helsdon\n& Ponman 2000; Mulchaey et al. 2003), the density at\n\u03c1 = 100 kpc is \u2248 10\u22124 cm\u22123 . If the group at z = 0.0965 is\nnot an X-ray group, one might expect a significantly lower\ngas density, i.e. one consistent with 10\u22125 cm\u22123 (Mulchaey\net al. 1996). We also note, however, that this system exhibits C III absorption and we have argued that the gas\nis predominantly photoionized and in a single phase (Pa-\n\nper I). We cannot rule out, however, that the the O VI gas\nis in a multi-phase medium.\n5.1.3. z = 0.16710\nThis partial Lyman limit system has been previously\nidentified with two galaxies at \u03c1 \u2248 100 kpc (Spinrad et al.\n1993). One of these is a bright early-type galaxy and the\nother is a dwarf galaxy with modest emission lines. These\nare the only two galaxies in our survey of the PKS0405\u2013\n123 field with impact parameter less than 150 kpc. Prior\nto performing our survey, we expected to identify additional galaxies at the redshift of the absorber in the field\nsurrounding the sightline. To our surprise, we find no additional galaxies at z \u2248 0.167 with L > 0.5L\u2217 within 3 Mpc\nof the absorber. In fact, there is only one additional galaxy\nwith |\u03b4v| < 300 km s\u22121 and it lies at an impact parameter\nof nearly 4 Mpc. We will return to this absorber in \u00a7 5.2.\n\n\f8\n\nProbing the IGM/Galaxy Connection Toward PKS0405-123 III:\n\nTable 2\nSUMMARY OF THE GALAXIES NEIGHBORING METAL-LINE ABSORPTION SYSTEMS\nID\n\nz\n\nR\n\nLum\n(L\u2217 )\n\n\u03b4v\n(km/s)\n\n\u03c1\n(kpc)\n\nEc\n\nLc\n\nz = 0.0918, NHI = 14.5, N (OVI) = 13.8, [M/H] = > \u22121.4\n1698\n0.0906\n19.74\n0.13\n-341\n412.4\n0.49\n0.04\n10258\n0.0899\n17.72\n0.87\n-517\n1175.1\n-0.03\n0.69\n3386\n0.0917\n17.81\n0.80\n-24\n1181.2\n1.00\n-0.03\n10552\n0.0916\n19.52\n0.17\n-60\n1455.3\n0.98\n0.20\n11489\n0.0903\n19.74\n0.14\n-403\n1457.6\n0.60\n-0.24\n10309\n0.0899\n17.09\n1.56\n-531\n1552.4\n-0.52\n0.47\n10900\n0.0912\n17.74\n0.85\n-161\n1986.0\n0.05\n0.64\n10498\n0.0908\n19.35\n0.19\n-276\n2081.1\n0.95\n0.07\n11603\n0.0908\n17.06\n1.59\n-278\n2354.3\n0.97\n0.14\n30847\n0.0902\n18.49\n0.43\n-436\n2427.6\n-0.24\n0.06\n30799\n0.0917\n15.97\n4.37\n-21\n2650.3\n0.94\n-0.16\n30260\n0.0899\n16.38\n2.99\n-522\n2669.7\n0.99\n-0.08\n41345\n0.0906\n19.37\n0.19\n-333\n2748.4\n-0.02 -0.09\n42607\n0.0911\n18.94\n0.28\n-206\n3305.6\n0.56\n0.09\n42613\n0.0908\n18.97\n0.27\n-263\n3462.5\n0.94\n0.39\n43005\n0.0910\n18.08\n0.62\n-226\n3536.0\n0.40\n0.64\n42509\n0.0924\n19.57\n0.16\n153\n3623.5\n0.50\n0.13\nz = 0.0965, NHI = 14.7, N (OVI) = 13.7, [M/H] = \u22121.5\n1457\n0.0965\n19.03\n0.29\n-13\n247.5\n0.18\n0.76\n1602\n0.0965\n19.01\n0.29\n-4\n342.7\n0.21\n0.27\n1601\n0.0967\n16.74\n2.39\n56\n350.7\n0.68\n0.38\n2254\n0.0970\n18.74\n0.38\n149\n629.9\n0.67\n0.46\n3138\n0.0980\n19.38\n0.21\n414\n770.8\n0.50\n-0.09\n1659\n0.0970\n17.99\n0.75\n132\n864.8\n0.00\n0.65\n2973\n0.0971\n18.52\n0.46\n161\n1006.3\n0.48\n0.49\n3082\n0.0973\n19.06\n0.28\n228\n1068.0\n0.87\n0.36\n2485\n0.0986\n18.05\n0.72\n573\n1123.1\n0.36\n0.69\n32180\n0.0974\n19.77\n0.15\n244\n1250.0\n0.19\n0.58\n31271\n0.0957\n18.13\n0.66\n-222\n1832.6\n-0.50\n0.45\n30806\n0.0964\n16.69\n2.50\n-18\n2186.3\n0.91\n0.05\n21111\n0.0994\n18.20\n0.62\n797\n2474.9\n0.88\n0.40\n21834\n0.1000\n17.49\n1.20\n970\n3307.2\n0.95\n0.15\nz = 0.1671, NHI = 16.5, N (OVI) = 14.8, [M/H] = \u22120.2\n90033\n0.1670\n21.00\n0.15\n-26\n92.6\n...\n...\n1753\n0.1670\n17.43\n4.14\n-15\n107.8\n0.65\n0.45\n40291\n0.1659\n18.30\n1.86\n-317\n3264.4\n1.00\n0.04\n30714\n0.1710\n18.49\n1.56\n997\n3629.7\n0.93\n-0.04\n30693\n0.1708\n18.32\n1.83\n960\n3661.2\n0.07\n0.81\n21409\n0.1650\n19.08\n0.90\n-547\n3739.0\n0.70\n0.50\n30811\n0.1673\n19.11\n0.88\n48\n3782.8\n0.19\n0.72\n21074\n0.1652\n19.33\n0.72\n-488\n4019.2\n0.31\n0.88\n41036\n0.1652\n18.63\n1.37\n-497\n4025.4\n1.00\n-0.02\n30761\n0.1698\n18.42\n1.66\n687\n4487.2\n0.25\n0.72\n41676\n0.1649\n17.61\n3.52\n-565\n4747.1\n0.39\n0.62\n20274\n0.1660\n19.52\n0.60\n-292\n4910.1\n0.51\n0.58\n41188\n0.1652\n18.93\n1.04\n-478\n4942.9\n0.92\n0.42\n42077\n0.1646\n18.15\n2.14\n-652\n5207.7\n1.00\n0.02\n41685\n0.1652\n19.36\n0.70\n-484\n5272.7\n0.24\n0.69\n42162\n0.1647\n17.88\n2.74\n-622\n5354.5\n0.97\n-0.10\n42163\n0.1647\n17.28\n4.78\n-629\n5375.1\n0.95\n0.11\n42816\n0.1650\n18.59\n1.42\n-548\n5899.1\n0.68\n0.48\n42990\n0.1653\n18.42\n1.66\n-468\n5914.8\n0.16\n0.84\n43154\n0.1650\n18.52\n1.52\n-536\n6064.1\n0.29\n0.64\nz = 0.1829, NHI = 14.1, N (OVI) = 14.0, [M/H] > \u22122.0\n3623\n0.1796\n19.17\n1.02\n-830\n1863.9\n-0.29\n0.80\n41580\n0.1819\n19.54\n0.73\n-261\n4859.0\n0.42\n0.69\n41714\n0.1823\n19.67\n0.65\n-155\n5032.4\n0.19\n0.10\n42851\n0.1822\n17.14\n6.61\n-176\n6432.7\n0.80\n0.34\n42801\n0.1842\n18.04\n2.87\n326\n6715.2\n-0.19\n0.71\n42983\n0.1834\n19.74\n0.60\n121\n6811.1\n0.68\n0.04\n\nNote. - The galaxy summary is restricted to those galaxies within 1000 km s\u22121 of the absorption system.

The NHI , N (OVI), and [M/H]\nvalues are taken from Paper I. The impact parameter refers to physical\nseparation, not comoving.\n\n5.1.4. z = 0.1829\nThere are two Ly\u03b1 absorbers at z = 0.1825 and z =\n0.1829 (Williger et al. 2006) with O VI/H I ratios differing by more than an order of magnitude (Paper I). Focusing on the O VI absorber at z = 0.1829, we identify zero\nL \u2248 L\u2217 galaxies within 2 Mpc of the sightline and none\nwithin 5 Mpc with |\u03b4v| < 800 km s\u22121 . Although our survey limit does not preclude the presence of a sub-L\u2217 galaxy,\nour results show that there is no significant galaxy group\nor large-scale structure associated with the gas. This observation is qualitatively different from all of the other\nmetal-line systems toward PKS0405\u2013123.\n5.1.5. Systems with z \u2248 0.36\nThere are a pair of metal-line systems at z = 0.3608 and\nz = 0.3633 with a velocity separation of \u03b4v = 550 km s\u22121 .\nThe absorber at z = 0.3608 is notable for exhibiting several oxygen ions yet no significant O VI absorption. In\ncontrast, the z = 0.3633 system exhibits O VI and likely\nC III gas. Our galaxy survey reveals a group of very bright,\nearly-type galaxies coincident with the z = 0.3608 absorber. One may place the gas within the elliptical at\n\u03c1 = 220 kpc (ID 1967) but more likely the gas is associated with the intragroup medium of these galaxies or a\ngalaxy below our magnitude limit (i.e. L < 2L\u2217 ). In any\ncase, this is a striking example of an over-dense galactic\nenvironment hosting a metal-line absorption system.\n5.1.6. z = 0.4951\nThis strong O VI absorption system is at too high redshift to even qualitatively discuss its galactic environment\nbased on our current survey. In passing, we note two galaxies with |\u03b4v| . 200 km s\u22121 and L \u2248 6L\u2217 which are at very\nlarge impact parameter (\u03c1 \u2248 10 Mpc) from the quasar\nsightline. We also note that the Williger et al. (2006)\ncompilation reveals no additional galaxies at fainter magnitudes closer to the sightline.\n\n4500\n\n5000\nRest Wavelength (\u00c5)\n\n5500\n\n6000\n\n6500\n\nFig. 8.- Galaxy spectrum of the likely host galaxy of the partial\nLyman-limit absorption system at z = 0.1671 toward PKS0405\u2013\n123. The Balmer features, weak [OII] emission, and absence of\n[O III] emission mark this galaxy as an Sb spectral type. This\nindicates minimal current star formation yet a significant episode of\nstar formation over the past \u223c 1Gyr.\n\n5.2. Halo Gas at Low Redshift\nConsider further the absorption system at z = 0.1671.\nCombining our galaxy survey with the sample from Williger\net al. (2006), it is apparent the system is associated with\none of the two galaxies at impact parameter \u03c1 \u2248 100 kpc\nfrom the sightline. We consider it very unlikely that the\ngas is within the halo of the low luminosity galaxy because (1) the gas has nearly solar metallicity and (2) the\ngas is almost certainly gravitationally bound to the bright\nspiral given the negligible velocity separation and large\nstellar mass of this galaxy. In the following, therefore, we\nphysically associate this metal-line system with the bright,\nearly-type spiral first identified by Spinrad et al. (1993).\nFigure 8 shows our WFCCD spectrum of this galaxy. One\nidentifies strong Ca H+K, G-band, and Balmer absorption\nlines in the spectrum and also a weak but significant [OII]\nemission line. The spectral type is that of an Sb galaxy\n(Kennicutt 1992) and the Balmer lines suggest a significant episode of star formation \u2248 1 Gyr ago.\nThis identification has several striking implications. First,\nthe observations suggest a tenuous, ionized multi-phase\ngas within the halo of the early-type spiral. As discussed\nin Chen & Prochaska (2000), the absorption system exhibits two distinct phases: (1) a photoionized gas associated with Si+ , Si++ , C+ ions and presumably the majority of H I gas. The temperature of this phase is a few\n104 K. Adopting the mean extragalactic background radiation field inferred by Dav\u00e9 & Tripp (2001), the mean\nnumber density of the gas is nH = 6 \u00d7 10\u22124 cm\u22123 ; (2) a\nhot, ionized gas associated with O VI, N V, and probable\nS VI absorption (Paper I). It is likely this gas is collisionally ionized with temperature T \u2248 2 \u00d7 105 K. It is important to note that the photoionized gas may have characteristics similar to higher redshift Mg II absorbers. The\nassociation of this gas with the bright, early-type spiral is\nsuggestive of the observed connection between bright spi-\n\n\f10\n\nProbing the IGM/Galaxy Connection Toward PKS0405-123 III:\n\ny (Mpc)\n\n5\n0\n\u22125\n\nz= 0.0300\nNHI= 14.2\n\nz= 0.2977\nNHI= 14.9\n\nz= 0.4057\nNHI= 14.9\n\nz= 0.1825\nNHI= 14.2\n\nz= 0.3510\nNHI= 14.9\n\nz= 0.4090\nNHI= 14.9\n\ny (Mpc)\n\n5\n0\n\u22125\n\n\u22125\n\n0\nx (Mpc)\n\n5\n\n\u22125\n\n0\nx (Mpc)\n\n5\n\n\u22125\n\n0\nx (Mpc)\n\n5\n\nFig. 9.- Plot of the spatial distribution of Ly\u03b1 'clouds' with NHI > 1014 cm\u22122 but no apparent metal-line absorption.

Indeed, Spinrad et al.\n(1993) reported a tentative detection of the Mg II doublet and noted the resemblance between this absorber and\nMg II systems (Steidel 1993). Adopting the photoionization model from Paper I, we predict log N (C IV) > 13.5\nfrom the low-ionization phase alone. We expect a C IV\nequivalent width in excess of 0.3\u00c5, and, therefore, that\nthis absorber would follow the results of other C IV/galaxy\nabsorber-pairs (Chen, Lanzetta, & Webb 2001).\nSecond, the velocity offset between the absorber and\ngalaxy redshift is small (\u03b4v \u2248 \u221215 km s\u22121 ) suggesting the\ngas is bound to the galaxy. Third, it suggests a significant\nmass of gas in the outskirts of the galactic halo. Applying\nthe ionization corrections derived in Paper I, we derive a\ntotal hydrogen column density NH = 1019 cm\u22122 for the gas\nassociated with the lower temperature phase. If we assume\na constant surface density to \u03c1 = 100 kpc with covering\nfraction f , then the integrated mass is M = f * 3 \u00d7 109M\u2299 .\nIf the surface density increases radially toward the galactic\ncenter, then the gas mass could be considerably higher\neven if the medium is clumped. Fourth, the gas has nearly\nsolar metallicity: [Si/H] = \u22120.25 dex. For this reason, it\nis very unlikely the gas is being accreted from the local\nIGM. Instead, we contend the gas was enriched within the\ngalaxy and then expelled to large radii. This interpretation\nis supported by the strong Balmer absorption lines in the\ngalaxy spectrum (Figure 8) which indicate a recent episode\nof star formation. Assuming a distance of 100 kpc, the gas\n\nwould only need an outflow velocity of \u223c 100 km s\u22121 to\ntravel this distance in 1 Gyr.\nFifth, we emphasize that the O VI equivalent width is\namong the largest observed at extragalactic distances. In\nChen & Prochaska (2000), we speculated that this gas\nmay arise in an intragroup medium. The results of our\ngalaxy survey contradict this claim. Instead, one must\nassociate the gas with one of the two nearby galaxies.\nThis has further implications for the multi-phase nature\nof the absorber. If the two phases are co-spatial, then it is\nvery likely in pressure equilibrium with the photoionized\ngas embedded within the hotter, collisionally ionized O VI\ngas. Adopting nH = 6 \u00d7 10\u22124 cm\u22123 and T \u2248 20000 K for\nthe photoionized phase and also Thot = 2 \u00d7 105 K for the\n\u22125\nO VI phase, we derive nhot\ncm\u22123 . As Chen &\nH = 6 \u00d7 10\nProchaska (2000) noted, the gas must have a density on\nthis order or lower to avoid cooling in less than a dynamical time. Therefore, a qualitatively self-consistent model\ncan be constructed where this partial Lyman limit system is a pressure-supported photoionized 'cloud' located\nin a warm, collisionally ionized gas at large radii from this\nearly-type spiral.\nSixth, adopting the nhot\nH density and assuming the hot\nphase fills the galactic halo to r = 100 kpc, we derive a hot\ngas mass M hot \u2248 5 \u00d7 109 M\u2299 . Seventh, we note that this\nsystem has the highest NHI value along the PKS0405\u2013123\nsightline and is the only absorber unambiguously identified with a galactic halo. While Ly\u03b1 'clouds' with NHI >\n\n\fPROCHASKA ET AL.\n\n11\n\nTable 3\nGALACTIC ENVIRONMENT SUMMARY\nz\n\nNHI\n\nNOVI\n\n[M/H]\n\n0.0918\n0.0965\n0.1671\n0.1829\n0.3608\n0.4951\n0.0300\n0.1825\n0.2977\n0.3510\n0.4057\n0.4089\n\n14.5\n14.7\n16.5\n14.1\n15.1\n14.4\n14.4\n14.9\n14.0\n14.2\n14.9\n14.4\n\n> \u22121.4\n\u22121.5\n\u22120.2\n> \u22122.0\n> \u22120.7\n> \u22120.3\n< \u22121.5\n< \u22121.5\n< \u22121.5\n< \u22121.5\n< \u22122.0\n< \u22121.5\n\n13.8\n13.7\n14.8\n14.0\n< 13.3\n14.3\n< 13.5\n< 13.8\n< 13.3\n< 13.5\n< 13.6\n< 13.5\n\n\u03c1a\nnearest\n(kpc)\n412\n247\n108\n4859\n220\n9378\n360\n4851\n236\n218\n747\n3242\n\nLa\nnearest\n(L\u2217 )\n0.1\n0.3\n4.1\n0.7\n8.2\n5.8\n0.0\n0.7\n2.6\n0.9\n1.3\n4.0\n\nLblim\n(L\u2217 )\n0.1\n0.1\n0.4\n0.5\n2.2\n4.7\n0.0\n0.5\n1.4\n2.1\n2.9\n3.0\n\n\u03c1>L\u2217\n(kpc)\n2354\n351\n108\n6433\n220\n9378\n888\n6421\n236\n4163\n747\n3242\n\nnc3Mpc\n\nComment\n\n7(1.2)\n5(1.2)\n1(1.8)\n0(1.9)\n5(0.4)\n0(0.0)\n2(0.8)\n1(1.9)\n10(0.3)\n1(0.4)\n3(0.0)\n3(0.0)\n\nFilament?\nGroup\nGalaxy\nVoid?\nGroup\n??\nGroup?\nVoid\nHalo\nVoid?\nFilament?\nFilament?\n\na Impact\n\nparameter and luminosity of the nearest galaxy to the sightline.\nmagnitude assuming Rlim =20mag.\nc Number of galaxies with physical impact parameter < 3 Mpc, L > max(L /2, L\n\u22121 .

We emphasize that this\nO VI absorber has one of the largest equivalent widths\nat extragalactic distance. Cosmological simulations suggest that absorbers with large equivalent widths are the\nmost likely to be collisionally ionized and also related to\nlarge-scale structures (Dav\u00e9 et al. 2001). In this case,\nhowever, the gas appears related to an individual galactic\nhalo and therefore bears greater resemblance to the O VI\ngas observed in the halo of the Milky Way (Sembach et\nal. 2003). It will be very valuable to examine the galactic\nenvironment of the strongest O VI absorbers and perform\nquantitative comparisons with simulations.\n5.3. NHI > 1014 cm\u22122 Absorbers Without Detected\nMetal-Lines\nBefore discussing the trends in the galactic environments\nof the metal-line absorbers, consider the environment of\nthe absorbers with comparable NHI but without detected\nmetal-lines. Figure 9 presents a summary of the galactic environment of the non-metal systems with NHI >\n1014 cm\u22122 from Williger et al. (2006). Examining the\nFigure, we note a picture qualitatively similar to the results for the metal-line systems. There are examples of\ndense galactic environments (z = 0.0300, 0.2977, 0.4057),\nabsorbers potentially within individual galactic halos (z =\n0.2977, 0.3510), and absorbers in very sparse environments\n(z = 0.1825) These results indicate that the cross-correlation\nobserved between Ly\u03b1 forest clouds with NHI > 1014 cm\u22122\nand galaxies is not dominated by the metal-line systems.\n5.4. Emerging Trends?\nConsidering the metal-line systems as a single class of\nabsorbers, one might have expected similarities in their\ngalactic environments. As Figure 7 qualitatively shows\n\n(summarized in Table 3), the absorption systems exist near\nor within a wide range of galactic environments. There are\nexamples where one can associate the absorber with the\nhalo of a nearby bright galaxy, examples where there is no\nbright host yet a group or large-scale structure, and even\nan example (z = 0.1825) with no associated galaxies with\nL & L\u2217 /2. It is evident that metal-enriched gas generally\nassociated with the IGM is located in a wide variety of\nenvironments at low redshift. A focus of our future work\nbased on over 10 quasar fields will be to examine the incidence of O VI absorbers in each of these environments.\nAlthough the PKS0405\u2212123 sightline contains only a\nsmall sample of metal-line absorbers, one can search for\nemerging trends between their galactic environment and\nabsorber properties. As a first step, we might separate the\nabsorbers according to whether they are located in 'rich'\nor 'poor' galactic environments. To qualitatively assess\nthe environment, we count the number of galaxies with\nL > L\u2217 /2 and |\u2206v| < 750 km s\u22121 within 3 Mpc of the\nsightline (Table 3). Under this definition, we classify the\nz = 0.0918, 0.0965, 0.36 absorbers as 'rich' (Ngal > 4) and\nthe z = 0.167, 0.1825 absorbers as 'poor' (Ngal < 3). The\nsurvey is not sufficiently deep to consider the system at\nz = 0.4951. With these classifications, there is no obvious\ntrend between galactic environment and absorber properties. The z = 0.167 and z = 0.1825 absorbers have\nvery different characteristics (NHI value, metallicity and\nionization states). The rich-environment z = 0.0965 and\nz = 0.3608 absorbers also have dissimilar physical properties. In short, we find no trend between galactic environment and metallicity, NHI , or ionization state, contrary to\nthe strong correlation between N (H I) and galaxy number\ndensity reported by Bowen et al. (2002). Given the small\nsample size (especially metal systems at z < 0.1 where\nL < L\u2217 /10), our conclusions do not necessarily disagree\nwith the findings of Stocke et al. (2006) who argue that the\npresence of metal-line systems is significantly correlated\nwith galactic environment, but do not draw a conclusion\nabout the properties of those systems with environment.\n\n\f12\n\nProbing the IGM/Galaxy Connection Toward PKS0405-123 III:\n\nExamining Figure 7, it is apparent that the metal-line\nsystems, which show a two magnitude spread in H I column density and metallicity, arise in regions with diverse\ngalaxy density and distribution. For example, contrast the\nabsorbers at z = 0.0918 and z = 0.0965 which exhibit similar H I column density and metal-line absorption. In both\ncases, there is a significant excess of galaxies observed at\nthe redshift. In the case of z = 0.0965, the majority of\ngalaxies lie within 1 Mpc of the absorber and very likely\nform a virialized group. In contrast, the galaxies associated with the z = 0.0918 absorber cover the entire fieldof-view in a distribution suggesting a larger-scale, unvirialized structure (e.g. filament or sheet).\n\n\u2022 In future papers, we will increase the sample size\nof sightlines by nearly an order of magnitude.\nParticular emphasis will be placed on studying\nthe galactic environment of low redshift, O VI\nabsorbers.\nWe thank D. Kelson and S. Burles who inspired several aspects of the WFCCD pipeline. We thank M. Geha\nfor providing observations of one mask for PKS0405\u2013123.\nThis work was partially supported by a FUSE GI grant to\nJXP under NASA contract NAG5-12496.\n\n5.5. The z \u223c 0.05 Ly\u03b1 Void\nWilliger et al. (2006) have stressed that the sightline\nto PKS0405\u2013123 exhibits no Ly\u03b1 absorbers with NHI >\n1014 cm\u22122 between 0.0320 < z < 0.0814. They also have\nargued that the probability of this occurrence from a random redshift distribution is P < 0.0004. Given the correlation between strong absorbers and galaxies (Chen et al.\n2005), one might expect a similar void in galaxies in this\nredshift interval. In the inner 10\u2032 minute field, we identify\nfour galaxies with redshift 0.0320 < z < 0.0814 at redshift:\nzgal =.043 (ID 2716), 0.0668 (ID 2999), 0.0767 (ID 1463),\n0.0770 (ID 993). Adopting the SDSS r\u2217 luminosity function (Blanton et al. 2005), we predict 7.4 \u00b1 3.2 galaxies\nin the volume subtended by a 10\u2032 radius where the uncertainty includes the effects of galaxy clustering (Connolly\net al. 2002). Therefore, the number of observed galaxies is below the expected central value but well within the\nexpected scatter.\n6. SUMMARY\n\nWe summarize the principal results of this paper as follows:\n\u2022 We presented the results of a galaxy redshift\nsurvey performed with the WFCCD spectrometer\nof the field surrounding PKS0405\u2013123. The survey\nis nearly complete to R = 20 mag within a radius\nof 10\u2032 . The Survey is supplemented by flanking\nfields covering \u2248 1\u0003\u25e6 to R = 19.5 mag. All of\nthe galaxy spectra are publically available at\nhttp://www.ucolick.org/\u223cxavier/WFCCDOVI/.\n\u2022 We examined the galactic environment of the\nmetal-line absorption systems identified along the\nsightline to PKS0405\u2013123, all but one of which\nshow O VI absorption. The systems arise within or\nnear regions of the universe with a wide range of\ngalactic environments including individual galactic\nhalos, galaxy groups, filamentary-like structures,\nand regions devoid of bright galaxies. This suggests\nthat metal-enrichment occurs in galaxies with a\nwide range of luminosity and environment.\n\u2022 For the sightline to PKS0405\u2013123, there is no\nsignificant difference in the galactic environment\nof NHI > 1014 cm\u22122 absorbers with or without\nmetal-lines. If this holds with larger samples,\nit would suggest that metal-enrichment is a\nstochastic process with little dependence on\ngalactic environment.\n\nREFERENCES\nAdelberger, K.L., Steidel, C.C., Shapley, A.E., & Pettini, M. 2003,\nApJ, 584, 45\nAguirre, A., Hernquist, L., Schaye, J., Katz, N., Weinberg, D.H., &\nGardner, J. 2001, ApJ, 561, 521\nBergeron, J. 1988, Large Scale Structures of the Universe, ed.\nJ.
