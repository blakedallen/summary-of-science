New Physics Directions and Experimental Facilities\nIn the last fifty years physics has made striking advances in describing the intimate structure of matter\nand the forces that determine the architecture of the universe. The simple structure of elementary\nconstituents and forces forms the theoretical framework called the \"Standard Model\", which has been\nable to predict with very good accuracy the values of many quantities that have been measured by\nexperiments at modern accelerators. But this theory is incomplete because: gravity is not included, it\nrequires as input a large number of parameters, some aspects, as for example electroweak symmetry\nbreaking, the striking asymmetry between the massless photon and the massive W and Z, the difference\nby many orders of magnitude between the masses of fundamental constituents or the number of flavour\nfamilies are not yet completely understood.\nExperimental research in order to clarify these understood fundamental aspects is performed in the main\nareas: accelerator based particle physics, high energy astrophysics, astroparticle experiments and the\nstudy of the cosmology of the early universe. To obtain relevant answers to this quest higher energies are\nnecessary, but this is not restricted to the highest energies, because at least observable traces of this new\n\n1\n\n\fphysics can be accessible also at low energy scales. So, new collider projects and studies of astroparticle\nphysics represent two complementary links to the same scope.\nDiscussions on the search for new physics at the future collider facilities are presented in references [1]\nand [2]; a review of this thematic at the interface between particle and astroparticle physics was done by\nPinfold [3].\nThe Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN will be operational from 2007. But the physics results expected\nfrom this facility will not be able to clarify all the unknowns of the Standard Model. So, despite the\ntechnological difficulty, significant upgrades of the accelerator in energy and luminosity are already considered\nas Super-LHC and Very-LHC respectively. SLHC will represent an upgrade of the LHC collider while VLHC\nwill be a new planned facility. The upgrade path will be defined by the results from the initial years of LHC\noperation, and now only possible scenarios can be done up to 240 TeV, the final energy of the project.\nThe Ultimate Large Hadron Collider (ULHC) [4] is imagined as accelerating protons at energies above 107 TeV\nin a ring with a circumference L\u22484\u00d7104 km around Earth and such a facility would permit to explore the\n\"intermediate\" energy scale, between the electroweek scale (1 TeV) and the scale of grand unification (around\n1014 TeV).\nLepton colliders in the TeV scale would seem to be the tool of precision measurement of the new physics\nin this energy range. Requirements from physics are discussed in [5]. Unfortunately the performance of a\nmulti - TeV e+e- collider is severely limited by breamstrahlung and (for circular machine) by synchrotron\nradiation. Two solutions are possible to minimise these effects: to build electron linear colliders [6], [7]\nor muon colliders [8]. Both alternatives are considered in present paper.\nThe International Linear Collider (ILC) should be the next large scale project operating after LHC and\nwith distinct physics goal. In the first stage a centre of mass energy of 500 GeV will be available,\nupgradable to about 1 TeV. The luminosity will be around 1034 cm-2s-1, corresponding to\n200\u00f7500 fb-1/year. The concrete realisation depends on the physics needs. At the present time different\nvariants are discussed.\nThe idea of high energy \u03b3 \u2212 \u03b3 and \u03b3 \u2212 e colliders with real photons on the base of a linear e+/-e- collider\nis not new. In linear colliders each bunch is used only once. It makes possible to convert electrons to high\nenergy photons and to obtain \u03b3 \u2212 \u03b3 or \u03b3 \u2212 e colliders with beams with approximately the same energy\nand luminosity as in the primary interaction processes. In these colliders, photon energy will be in the\nrange from 100 GeV to several TeV, the number of high energy photons must be about 1010 per bunch\nwith a transverse size at the interaction point (IP) close to 10-5\u00f710-7 cm. Detailed analysis of this subject\nhas been performed by Telnov [9] and Serbo [10].\nIn the last period arguments in favour of lepton-hadron (as eLHC) and photon-hadron colliders in the\nsame TeV energy scale are discussed. A review of this proposal and of its advantages for crucial\nclarification of the dynamics of strong interaction could be found, for example, in Ref. [11] and in the\nreferences cited therein. These possible facilities are not considered here.\nThe main parameters of the future accelerator colliders, relevant for the present investigation, are\npresented in Table 1. For LHC upgrade, details could be found in references [12]] and [13]. .In Table 1,\nsome characteristics of the background radiation in the interaction cavity where detectors work are also\nincluded.

Intervals represent the\ndifferences between GEANT and MARS simulations.\n2)\n\nAnother possibility to obtain information about the interactions of ultra high energy particles, complementary to\ncolliders, is the exploitation of astroparticles or cosmic rays (CR). This supposes experiments with cosmic\nbeams and terrestrial detectors, or complete experiments in space. We concentrate only to investigate effects to\ndetectors in space. Galactic cosmic rays originating far outside our solar system are the most typical cosmic\nrays. They are the origin of the inner radiation belt, with their flux modulated by solar activity or as solar\nenergetic particles. Protons are the most abundant charged particles in space. The CR proton spectrum, in the\nkinetic energy range up to hundred GeV, in the neighbourhood of Earth, as have been measured by the Alpha\nMagnetic Spectrometer during space shuttle flight STS-91 [17] for example, and their spectra was simulated by\nDESIRE Collaboration [18]. Extreme high energy CR particles, produced by different mechanisms, are not\nconsidered because their flux is irrelevant to produce any effect of degradation in detectors. It must be\nmentioned that the domain of energy between 105\u00f7108 TeV of the ultra high energy-CR, interpreted as the onset\nof extragalactic proton dominance in the data [19] is closed by the expected energy of protons at ULHC\ncollider.\nIn this work, the expected behaviour of detectors - only silicon option being considered, for this new era of HEP\nchallenges, is discussed. Due to the existence, long time, of intense radiation fields in the environments where\ndetectors work, bulk displacement damage in silicon is produced, and consequently effects appear at the device\nlevel that limit their long time utilisation, increasing the leakage current and the depletion voltage sometimes up\nto breakdown, and thus affecting the lifetime of detector systems.\n\n3\n\n\f2. Radiation Background for Detectors\nThe overall detector performance in high energy experiments is dependent on the background particle\nrates in various detector components. The knowledge of mutual effects of the radiation environment\nproduced by the accelerator and experiments represents one of the key issues in the development of\ndetectors.\nDespite different colliding particle types and machine parameters, there are many common features of\nthe radiation background in detectors at these accelerators.\nParticles originating from the interaction point and collision remnants are most often the major source of\nbackground in detectors at the hadron or lepton colliders. Beam loss in the vicinity of the interaction\npoint is the second source of background.\nIn silicon detectors, radiation damage is essentially correlated with the flux of particles and their energies\nin background, because they contribute to the rate of generation of primary defects in the material. Also,\nhigh instantaneous particle fluxes complicate track reconstruction and cause increased trigger rates and\naffect detector occupancy. The existence long time of high radiation levels will produce radio activation\nof detector components as well as radiation environment in the experimental hall and in its surroundings.\nIn the LHC case, inside the tracker cavity, hadrons represent about 54% of all produced particles, and the\npions are the most abundant, around 64% of all hadrons [20]. In the present work, the simulated charged\nhadron spectra at different positions inside the tracking cavity, for the concrete CMS future experiment,\nare used, from Reference [21]. The position (r=20 cm, z=0\u00f760 cm) which corresponds to the maximum\nin flux is considered. This particular choice does not affect the main conclusions, because similar\nradiation fields are predicted also by the ATLAS Collaboration. For LHC upgrade (SLHC and VLHC),\nthe following hypotheses were considered: increase in luminosity and increase in the energy of the beam\nthat, in agreement with Gianotti's evaluations [13], conduces to higher values of the mean energy of the\nspectra. For this case, we supplementary supposed that the shape of differential energetic spectra of pions\nand protons remains unmodified, and is only shifted to higher energy. The same scenario is considered\nalso for the ULHC case.\nAt lepton colliders, the background arises from beam \u2013 beam effects, synchrotron radiation and muons.\nAs we pointed out before, to create a \u03b3\u03b3 or a \u03b3e collider, their parameters must be comparable to those\nin e+e- colliders. The main sources of background at photon colliders are hadrons, e+e-pairs and photons.\nHadrons are produced in \u03b3 + \u03b3 \u2192 hadrons processes. With a cross section of about 500 nb, for a typical\nluminosity of 1034 cm-2s-1 in an electron linear collider, the background rate is 0.5 events/bunch crossing.\nElectrons/positrons are produced as pairs or as low energy electrons after multiple Compton scattering\n(disrupted beams). If these low energy electrons can be removed from the IP, thus, the level of e+ and ein the vertex detector is approximately the same as for e+e- collider [9], eventually with an additional\ncontribution due the particles reflected by mirrors. The photons come from Compton scattering,\nbeamstrahlung or from halo of X rays.\nFor concrete estimation, following Telnov's and Serbo's conclusions we consider that at the electron\nlinear collider and photon collider the luminosity is the same as at LHC, but the hadronic background\nrate is up to 5 orders of magnitude lower. We also suppose that the spectra are similar.\nThe case of cosmic rays is different. If one considers that silicon detectors will be exposed directly in\nspace, thus, in essence their degradation is produced by primary cosmic protons and supplemented by\ndifferent contributions from other particles; if the detectors will be placed in a cavity, the contribution\nfrom background must also be considered.\n\n4\n\n\f3. Interactions of Particles in the Detector and the Kinetics of Defects\nThe nuclear interaction between the incident particle and the lattice nuclei of the detector produces bulk\ndefects. After this interaction process, the recoil nucleus or nuclei are displaced from lattice positions\ninto interstitials, in their initial positions remaining vacancies. Then, the primary knock-on nucleus, if its\nenergy is large enough, could produce the displacement of a new nucleus, and the process continues as\nlong as the energy of the colliding nucleus is higher than the threshold for atomic displacements. The\nphysical quantity characterising the process is the concentration of primary defects produced per unit of\nfluence of the incident particles (CPD(E)).\nThe primary recoil is either a nucleus of the medium (produced in an elastic or quasielastic interaction\nprocess), or a nucleus with a lower mass and charge numbers - after inelastic interactions. As a\nconsequence, for each medium a whole family of curves, L(ER), function of incident energy, i.e. energy\nspent into non-ionising processes versus recoil energy, could be obtained. These are the Lindhard curves\nand are used in the evaluation of the damage produced in materials. The concentration of the primary\nradiation induced defects per unit of particle fluence could be calculated using the explicit formula:\n\nCPD(E ) =\n\nN\n2 Ed\n\n\u239b d\u03c3 \u239e\n\u222b \u2211 \u239c\u239d d\u03a9 \u239f\u23a0 L(E )d\u03a9\n\n(1)\n\nRi\n\ni\n\ni\n\nwhere E is the kinetic energy of the incident particle, N is the atomic density of the target element, A\nis the atomic number of the silicon target, Ed - the threshold energy for displacements (with values\nfunction of the defined symmetry plane), E Ri - the recoil energy of the residual nucleus produced in\ninteraction i, L(E Ri ) - the Lindhard factor that describes the partition of the recoil energy between\n\n(\n\n)\n\nionisation and displacements and d\u03c3\n\n10\n\n5\n\n10\n\n4\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n0\n\n-1\n\nCPD [cm ]\n\nd\u03a9 i - the differential cross section of the interaction between the\nincident particle and the nucleus of the lattice for the process or mechanism (i ) , responsible in defect\nproduction. The energy dependences of CPD for different incident particles in silicon are presented in\nFigure 1\n\n10\n\nprotons\npions\nelectrons\nphotons\nneutrons\n\nULHC\nVLHC\nSLHC\nLHC\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\n4\n\nKinetic Energy [MeV]\nFigure 1.\nConcentration of primary defects in silicon as function of the energy of primary particle\n\nAfter this step, the physical quantity that is essential for degradation processes is the rate of generation of\ndefects in the material of the detector, by irradiation, defined as:\n\nGirrad =\n\n\u2211 \u222b CPD(E )\u03a6(E )dE\n\n(2)\n\nall particles\n\n5\n\n\fwhere \u03a6(E ) is the differential flux for the considered particles.\nIt must be mentioned that in Girrad , the identity of the primary particles which initiated the bulk process\nis lost.\nFor hadron colliders considered here, the expected averaged energy, <ET>, corresponds to values for\nCPD(E) in the vicinity of its asymptotic high energy limit:\n\nCPD asymp (E ) \u2245\n\nN\n2Ed\n\n\u2211 L(E )\u03c3\nRi\n\ni\n\n,\n\n(3)\n\ni\n\nas could be seen in Figure 1. In this region, the values of CPD are nearly equal for different hadrons.\nIn the case of \u03bc+\u03bc- collider, the mean values of energies of electrons correspond to their asymptotic\nregion in CPD. Also, in accord with Geer's simulations [16], at 5 cm from vertex there will be 1.69\u00d710-7\nphotons, 8.4 \u00d710-11 electrons, 1.6\u00d710-9 neutrons, per act of muon - muon interaction, and 4.4\u00d710-10 (\u03b3)\nand 1.5\u00d710-9 (n) in the tracker, at 50 cm. Other contributions are irrelevant.\nIn the last years, the CR proton spectrum, in the neighbourhood of Earth, has been measured by the AMS\nexperiment during the space shuttle flight STS-91 and published in Ref. [17]. In reference [18], Ersmark\nand co-workers presented the belt proton spectra at 51.60 and at 330, 380 and 430 km, simulated with\nGEANT4, for the International Space Station orbit in free space as well as the effects due the presence of\nthe station. The spectra of secondary particles entering the Columbus cabin have also been simulated and\nwere considered in the present analysis. Primary cosmic ray protons have energies in the range between\nsome MeV up to 105 GeV.\nIn Table 2, we present the calculated values for the rate of generation of primary defects in silicon, in the\nradiation fields corresponding to different future facilities.\n\nTable 2.\nContributions of different particles at the rate of generation of defects\nin silicon in the radiation environments of the new facilities / experiments.\n\nSource\n\nRate of generation of defects due to irradiation [pairs/cm3/sec]\nProtons\n\nLHC\nSLHC (stage 1)\nSLHC (stage 2)\nVLHC (stage 1)\nVLHC (stage 2)\nULHC\nILC/gamma-gamma1)\n\u03bc+\u03bc-\n\n5.6x107\n5.6x108\n3.0x108\n2.9x108\n2.2x108\n6.x107\n1.6x106\n\nNeutrons\n\nNew colliders\n\nPions\n\nPhotons\n\n6.2x108\n6.2x109\n5.1x109\n5.0x109\n3.5x109\n8.1x108\n\n3.3x109\nCosmic rays\n\nBelt protons (at 330km)\n1.x105\nBelt protons (at 380km)\n1.9x105\nBelt protons (at 430km)\n3.4x105\nBelt and solar protons\n7.2x105\nParticle spectra in Columbus cabin\n68\n220\n1)\nEstimation based on Serbo's and Telnov's considerations.\n\nElectron\ns\n\n4.4x103\n\n30.7\n\n3.8\n\nTotal\n\n6.x103\n\n6.8x108\n6.8x109\n5.4.x109\n5.3.x109\n3.7x109\n8.7x108\n<104\n\u22483.3x109\n\n3.2\n\n1.x105\n1.9x105\n3.4x105\n7.2x105\n\u2248326\n\nThe total rates of generation of defects include also thermal contributions.

This new defect has been predicted by Goedecker and co-workers\n[23] and its characteristics were indirectly determined by Lazanu and Lazanu [24].\nSo,\nG\n(V + SiFFCD ) + I .\nSi \u23af\u23af\u2192\n\n(4)\n\nThe rate G is a sum of contributions from thermal generation and irradiation. The phenomena occurring in the\nmaterial after primary defect production are considered in the frame of the theory of diffusion limited reactions.\nThe complete list of reactions considered is also presented in Ref. [24].\nThe model predicts absolute values for microscopic quantities \u2013 concentrations of defects which could be\nused to evaluate device degradation, without free parameters.\nUntil now, systematic experimental studies to put in evidence detector degradation were realised by\nexposing these devices in radiation fields at different irradiation facilities by step by step\nirradiations/relaxations, up to fixed fluences. In fact, these experimental setups differ from realistic\nconditions where detectors are exposed for long times to continuous irradiation fields. These\nexperimental results were utilised as a useful tools to test the validity of the theoretical model developed\nby the authors and to understand the mechanisms of damage and the results were presented in Reference\n[25]. In spite of the simplicity of the model, a remarkable agreement was obtained between model\ncalculations and experimental data for leakage current and effective carrier concentration, considering\ndifferent materials (FZ and DOFZ silicon), with resistivities in the range 1\u00f715 k\u03a9cm, and irradiated with\nprotons, pions, neutrons and electrons . In the case of CZ silicon technology the model is able to\nreproduce the situations corresponding to low fluences (beginning of irradiation), but supplementary\nprocesses must be considered, most probable associated with the presence of oxygen in the material.\n\n4.

For both materials, for rates of generation of defects\nbelow 105 pairs/cm3/sec (corresponding to cosmic fields and ILC), the inversion does not occur, and for\nDOFZ material the modification of Neff is irrelevant.\nThe predicted results suggest that the DOFZ Si is radiation harder only in conditions of weaker radiation\nfields (as cosmic and ILC ones) and the behaviour of DOFZ silicon detectors is satisfactory in the first\nmonths of operation at \u03bc+\u03bc- and LHC and its upgrades. For longer time of irradiation at these last\nfacilities, it is not possible to make a choice between FZ and DOFZ materials. So, DOFZ technology is\nmore useful for low rates of primary defects and/or relatively short times of exploitation.\n\n8\n\n\f-3\n\nNeff [cm ]\n\n10\n\n15\n\n10\n\n14\n\n10\n\n13\n\n10\n\n12\n\n10\n\n11\n\nLHC updates\n\nLHC\nILC\n\n\u03bc\u03bc\n\nULHC\n\nSi FZ\n10\n\n-3\n\ncosmic\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n1\n\nTime [years]\n\nFigure 4\nTime dependence of Neff in FZ Si detectors during continuous irradiation in different environments\n\nIf silicon detectors are directly exposed to primary proton fluxes from cosmic rays, the dominant\ncontribution to degradation comes from protons with low energy, and increases with the distance from\nthe Earth.

Conclusions and Summary\nThe main features of microscopic and macroscopic degradation of detectors, after lepton and hadron\nirradiations, produced in silicon grown by FZ and DOFZ technologies could be reproduced in the frame\nof the present model. The pre-existence of phosphorus, oxygen and carbon impurities, the generation of\nprimary defects: self-interstitial, classical and fourfold coordinated vacancy - SiFFCD thermally and in\nirradiation processes, as well as their kinetics are major physical aspects that must be considered.\nThe effects of the radiation in silicon are dependent on the rate of generation of primary defects, but they\nare neither clearly correlated with the concentration of oxygen in silicon \u2013 except the case of low rates or\nshort time of irradiation, nor with the resistivity of the starting material in the range 1 \u00f7 15 K\u03a9cm. The\nidentity of the primary particle which initiated the bulk processes is lost after the primary interaction.\nFor continuous irradiation, the obtained results suggest that the differences between DOFZ and FZ\nsilicon could be observed only in the first months of operation, where DOFZ silicon seems radiation\nharder. For long times of irradiation and / or high fluences, it is not possible to make a choice from FZ\nand DOFZ materials. DOFZ technology is more useful for low rates of primary defect generation and in\nconditions of relatively short times of exploitation.\nThe calculated degradation of the leakage current of silicon detectors scales with the rate of primary\ndefect generation.\nIn agreement with model predictions, the contribution of primary defects is important and must be\nconsidered.\nThese processes have temperature dependence and the decrease of the temperature is strongly required in\norder to diminish these macroscopic effects.\n\n10\n\n\fReferences\n\n1.\n2.\n3.J.\n4.\n5.\n6.\n7.\n8.\n9.\n10.\n11.\n12.\n\n13.\n14.\n15.\n16.\n17.\n18.\n19.\n20.\n21.\n22.\n23.\n24.\n25.\n\nI.
