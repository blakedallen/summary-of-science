Our analysis provides a method for extracting these dominant\nloops from short time series, even if they only show transient trajectories.\nPACS numbers: 05.45.Ac,82.40.Bj,05.45.Tp\n\nMany biological systems can be described by directed\nnetworks, where nodes represent different components\nand arrows represent interactions. In cell biology, nodes\nare molecules, while arrows stand for complex formation, protein modification, transcription regulation, etc.\nEcosystems constitute another example, where nodes are\nspecies and arrows represent predation, competition and\nsymbiosis. Biological functions are often performed by\nspecific small subnetworks, or modules [1]. A dynamical\nmodel of a module requires, beyond the knowledge of the\nnetwork structure, some hypothesis on the form of the\ninteractions, which are often poorly characterized. It is\nthen crucial to develop techniques to study the qualitative dynamics of modules assuming limited information.\nWe present a method to obtain information about patterns in the dynamics of biological feedback networks.\nGiven the network structure, i.e., which nodes activate/repress which other nodes, it is possible to predict the ordering of maxima and minima of the dynamical variables. Vice versa, from an experimentally observed ordering one can obtain some information about\nthe structure of the network. The method is a generalization of the one introduced in [2] for the dynamics of\na single negative feedback loop, without any cross links,\nwhere a unique pattern is allowed. A More complex network structure [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8] allows multiple dynamical\npatterns. Moreover, a particular observed pattern could\noriginate from different network structures. Nevertheless, our method can reduce the possibilites and provides\nnon-trivial information that can guide experiments. Our\ntechnique also applies when the dynamics is transient, so\nthat information can be obtained, for example, by watching how the concentrations of proteins and genes belonging to a given module relax to a stationary state after a\nperturbation. This extends the use of our formalism to\ncases in which oscillations are damped [7].\nWe consider a system described by N dynamical variables, xi , i = 1 . . . N , which we call \"densities\" and could\nrepresent, for example, the concentrations of the chemical\nspecies composing the network/module. We assume that\n\nthey evolve with time in a deterministic way, according\nto a system of differential equations:\n\ndxi\n= gi (x1 , x2 . . . xN )\ndt\n\ni = 1 . . . N.\n\n(1)\n\nMany possible dynamical systems may correspond to\na given network. The only constraints we impose are\nthat the interactions be monotonic, i.e., each off-diagonal\nelement of the Jacobian matrix, \u2202xj gi , is either positive\neverywhere in phase space (when node j activates i), or\nnegative everywhere (j represses i), or zero everywhere\n(no arrow from j to i). In words, activators are always\nactivators and repressors are always repressors. Indeed,\ntranscription factors rarely switch from being activators\nof a particular gene to repressors at different densities;\na predator of a particular species does not become its\nprey when their abundances change. We do not require\nmonotone self-interactions: a variable may activate or\nrepress itself depending on the densities.\nWe associate to each state (x1 , x2 . . . xN ) a symbol\nsuch as (+, \u2212, \u2212, . . . +). This N -component sign vector describes which densities are increasing and which\nare decreasing at a given time: the i-th component is\njust the sign of gi (x1 , x2 . . . xN ). Such a representation divides the phase space into sectors, each associated with a symbol, in which each density has a definite increasing/decreasing behavior. The sectors' boundaries are the nullclines, i.e. the manifolds satisfying\ngi (x1 , x2 . . . xN ) = 0. Our goal is to determine the conditions under which the trajectory can cross a nullcline.\nThis requires a density to change from increasing to decreasing (or vice versa) and is equivalent to determining\nwhen the density can have a maximum or minimum.\nFor example, a minimum for the variable xi corresponds to a crossing of the nullcline gi = 0 from the\nregion gi < 0 to the region gi > 0. This is possible\nonly if, somewhere on the nullcline, the scalar product\nbetween the vector field ~g and the vector \u2207gi (which is\n\n\f2\na)\n+++\n\n1\n3\n\n2\n\n++\u2212\n\n\u2212++\n\n+\u2212\u2212\n\n\u2212\u2212+\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\n\nb)\n\nc)\n\n100\n\n150\n30\n\n2\n\n10\n\n80\n\n20\n\n1\n\n10\n\n100\n\n0\n\n10\n\n60\n\n10\n\n\u22121\n\n10\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n0\n\n10\n\ntime\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n40\n\n50\n20\n0\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\ntime\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n0\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\ntime\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\nFIG. 1: Simple example of the use of symbolic dynamics.\n(a) (left) Scheme of the network.

By assumption, all the derivatives have fixed\nsigns, and in any given sector the gj 's also have fixed\nsigns (encoded in the associated symbol). If the symbol\nand derivative signs are such that each term is negative,\nthen the sum cannot be positive. This implies the rule:\nA variable cannot have a minimum if all its repressors\nare increasing and all its activators are decreasing.\nSimilarly, for maxima:\nA variable cannot have a maximum if all its repressors\nare decreasing and all its activators are increasing.\nUsing the above two rules we can construct a network\nof allowed transitions for a given biological module, with\none node for each symbol and an arrow for each transition that does not violate the above rules. Note that the\ntransition network will only have arrows connecting symbols differing by a single sign, because each maximum or\nminimum corresponds to a single sign flip.\nWe first consider the example network of Fig. 1a(left):\na three-species negative feedback loop with a cross-link\nfrom node 3 to 2 that introduces a positive feedback. By\nchecking all the allowed transitions we construct the cor-\n\nresponding transition network, shown in Fig. 1a(right).\nFor example, from the symbol (\u2212 + +) the transition\n(\u2212 + +) \u2192 (\u2212 + \u2212) is ruled out because all the activators of node 3 are increasing, therefore it cannot have\na maximum. Similarly we rule out all transitions from\nit except (\u2212 + +) \u2192 (\u2212 \u2212 +). The result, in this case,\nis a simple modification of the transition network for a\nsingle negative feedback loop shown by the solid arrows\nin Fig. 1a(right)[2]. With the cross link present, the\nadditionally allowed transitions are the ones shown with\ndashed arrows. The following dynamical system illustrates these possibilities: x \u03071 = c \u2212 x1 x3 /(k1 + x1 ); x \u03072 =\nx21 + a [\u03b8(x3 \u2212 k2 ) \u2212 1] \u2212 x2 ; x \u03073 = x2 \u2212 x3 . The major\nnonlinearity is the Heaviside step function: \u03b8(x) = 0 for\nx < 0, and \u03b8(x) = 1 for x > 0[20]. By choosing parameters such that the cross link is weak (c = 30, a = 10, k1 =\n0.1, k2 = 20) one obtains dynamics of Fig. 1b, which is\nidentical to the simple 3-species loop. As the strength of\nthe cross link is increased (a = 50), the symbolic dynamics changes to also exhibit the dashed transitions. This is\nshown in Fig. 1c where variable x2 develops a new small\nmaximum, thus changing the symbolic dynamics.\nWe now move on to a system that exhibits a richer\nrange of dynamical behaviours (see Fig. 2a). It consists of two negative feedback loops, coupled via a shared\nspecies. This network has been widely studied in the ecological literature [9, 10, 11] as a model for three trophic\nlevel ecosystems: species x3 feeds on x2 , and x2 feeds\non x1 . The chaotic properties of this motif have been\nused to interpret data from the Canadian lynx-hare cycle, showing irregular oscillations [12].\nWe consider first the Hastings-Powell (HP) model [10]\nas a dynamical system corresponding to this network:\nx \u03071 = rx1 (1 \u2212 kx1 ) \u2212 \u03b11 x1 x2 /(1 + b1 x1 )\nx \u03072 = \u2212d1 x2 + \u03b11 x1 x2 /(1 + b1 x1 ) \u2212 \u03b12 x2 x3 /(1 + b2 x2 )\nx \u03073 = \u2212d2 x3 + \u03b12 x2 x3 /(1 + b2 x2 )\n\n(3)\n\nwith the following parameter choices: \u03b11 = \u03b12 = 4,\nb1 = b2 = 3, d1 = .4, d2 = .6, k = 1.5. By increasing\nthe parameter r, a stable limit cycle undergoes a series\nof period doubling bifurcations, followed by the onset of\nchaos. A projection of the attractor on the x2 \u2212 x3 plane\nis shown in Fig.(3). The chaotic trajectory looks similar\nto the periodic one, except for the irregular behavior of\nthe amplitude [11]. This means that the same sequence\ncorresponding to the periodic orbit is observed after the\nonset of chaos. By increasing r even more, we found a\nregular window with a change in the symbolic dynamics\n(the \"kick\", shown in red in the attractor in Fig. 3 and\nin the bifurcation diagram, Fig. 4a, and corresponding\nto the blue dashed transition in Fig. 2b). The kick is\nstill present when, by further increasing r, the dynamics\nbecomes chaotic again.\nThe conclusion is that the same symbolic dynamics\nobserved close to the Hopf bifurcation is found in a large\n\n\f3\na)\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nb)\n\n+\u2212\u2212\n\n++\u2212\n\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\n\n\u2212+\u2212\n\n+++\n\n+\u2212+\n\n\u2212++\n\n\u2212\u2212+\n\nFIG. 2: Network of two coupled two-species oscillators.

Here, a convenient control parameter is c.\nWe observe the same scenario in the bifurcation diagram\n(see Fig. (4b)): periodic orbit, then chaotic but same\nperiodic symbolic dynamics, then different symbolic dynamics in a regular window and, finally, chaotic symbolic\ndynamics. Note, however, that the periodic symbolic dynamics observed close to the Hopf bifurcation is different\nfrom that observed in the HP model.\nTo test the robustness of the two sequences, we tried to\nchange the functional form of the interaction between x2\nand x3 by setting b2 = 0 in the HP model or, conversely,\nintroducing saturated response in the BHS model. We\nalso tried to vary the parameters of both systems, by\nup to 50% from their default values. The two symbolic\nsequences were not affected by any of these changes. A\npossible cause for this robust difference could be the logistic term in the first equation of (3), acting as a regulator\nso that the full dynamics is bottom-up controlled.\nThe difference between the symbolic dynamics of the\nHP and BHS systems can be used for model selection: in\nthe example of the Canadian lynx system, one has access\nonly to the lynx population time series, but temporal\nmeasurements of the hare and grass abundances could\nbe used to understand which model is more appropriate.\nInterestingly, from the point of view of maxima/minima\norder, these two systems behave like two different, single\nnegative feedback loops [2]: 3 \u22a3 2 \u22a3 1 \u22a3 3 (HP system)\nand 1 \u2192 2 \u2192 3 \u22a3 1 (BHS system).

The reverse process uses the transitions observed in an experimental\ntime series to infer information about the underlying network. For example, the circadian oscillations of the three\n\n\f4\ngenes kaiA, B, C in cyanobacteria [13] were shown in ref.\n[2] to have the following symbolic dynamics (B, A, C):\n(+ + +) \u2192 (\u2212 + +) \u2192 (\u2212 \u2212 +) \u2192 (\u2212 \u2212 \u2212) \u2192 (+ \u2212 \u2212) \u2192\n(+ + \u2212) \u2192 (+ + +). Several networks are consistent with\nthis pattern \u2013 the simplest is the loop B \u2192 A \u2192 C \u22a3 B,\nas suggested in ref. [2]. Experiments have shown that\nA \u2192 C and C \u22a3 B, and that all three genes are essential for oscillations [14]. With this information we can\nget non-trivial guidelines for which further interactions to\nlook for experimentally: (i) kaiA must be either activated\nby kaiB, or repressed by kaiC (or both), (ii) if kaiA is\nnot activated by kaiB then, in addition to kaiC \u22a3 kaiA,\nkaiB must activate kaiC, so that the underlying network\nlooks similar to Fig. 2a. Of course, these predictions are\nfor \"effective\" interactions, which at the molecular level\ncould involve multiple intermediates, such as chemical\ncomplexes and various protein activity states. Ref. [2]\nshows how the method can reconstruct effective interactions even in the presence of intermediate species.\nThis circadian example also points out how much information our method provides. The transition (+ + +) \u2192\n(\u2212 + +) means that either B \u22a3 A or C \u22a3 A. Later transitions show that either A \u2192 B or C \u22a3 B, and A \u2192 C\nor B \u2192 C. Even without the extra experimental information, our method reduces the possibilities for the\nadjacency matrix of the underlying network from 36 to\n53 , a factor of \u2248 6. In a general N node system, with\nM independent observed transitions, the fraction of allowed adjacency matrices is [1 \u2212 (2/3)N \u22121 ]M ; the smaller\nthe network and the more the transitions seen, the more\nuseful the method. A full oscillation cycle would show at\nleast N independent transitions. If the system instead\nreaches a fixed point, the transient can still be used.\nOur method can be considered as complementary to\nthe \"threshold method\", described in Refs. [15, 16, 17,\n18], which provides a different way of dividing the phase\nspace into sectors, based on a choice of thresholds for\neach variable. The \"threshold\" method generates a transition diagram, which depends on parameter values. It is\nparticularly suited to cases where the input functions are\nBoolean or step-like, so thresholds can be easily identified, and self-interactions are piecewise linear [19]. Our\n\"derivative\" method, in contrast, requires no choice of\nthresholds, generates a diagram independent of parameter values, and works for arbitrary self-interactions, but\nrequires monotonicity in the other interactions.\nIn summary, we showed a method to construct a symbolic transition network that imposes a strong constraint\non the dynamics monotone systems, like many biological\nmodules. In all the cases we studied, the periodic sym-\n\nbolic dynamics observed close to the Hopf bifurcation\nis found in a large region of parameter space, even when\nthe system becomes chaotic. This explains the commonly\nobserved phenomenology of a chaotic attractor consisting of oscillations with randomly varying amplitude [11].\nThe oscillatory systems we looked at produce a symbolic\nsequence identical to that of a single negative feedback\nloop for most studied parameter values. By identifying\nthese loops, our method can be used to derive minimal\nmodels of complex, oscillatory biological systems.\nWe acknowledge Leon Glass for stimulating discussions\nand the Danish National Research Foundation and VILLUM KANN RASMUSSEN Foundation for funding.\n\n\u2217\nURL: http://cmol.nbi.dk\n[1] L.
