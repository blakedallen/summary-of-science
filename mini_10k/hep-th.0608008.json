Within gravitational alternative for dark energy (for review, see [1]), the cosmic speed-up is explained\nby the universe expansion where some sub-dominant\nterms (like 1/R[2, 3] or lnR[4] which may be caused by\nstring/M-theory[5]) may become essential at small curvature. It also explains naturally the unification of earlier and later cosmological epochs as the manifestation of\ndifferent role of gravitational terms relevant at small and\nlarge curvature as it happens in the model with negative\nand positive powers of curvature [6]. Moreover, modified\ngravity may serve as dark matter.\nSpecial attention is paid to f (R) modified gravity which may be constrained from cosmological/astrophysical observational data [7] and solar\nsystem tests [6, 8, 9, 10]. Recently, very interesting\nattempt to constrain such model (with positive and\nnegative powers of curvature) from fifth force/BBN\nconsiderations has been made in [11] where it was shown\nthat it is not easy to fulfil the known constraints and\nto describe the sequence of known cosmological epochs\nwithin the simple theory with positive and negative\npowers of curvature[6]. The cosmological dynamics of\n1/R and other related f (R) theories leading to late-time\nacceleration has been studied in refs.[2, 3, 4, 6, 12] while\nSdS black holes solutions were discussed in [13].\nIn the situation when General Relativity can not nat-\n\n\u2020 also\n\nat Lab.

Of course, it is too strong (at least, at first\nstep) to request that such theory should correctly reproduce all known sequence of cosmological epochs (including inflationary universe where quantum effects may be\nessential). Nevertheless, it is reasonable to constrain such\na theory (if this is really alternative theory for General\nRelativity) by the condition that it reproduces well established sequence of classical cosmological phases (matter\ndominated phase, transition from deceleration to acceleration and current universe speed-up) being consistent\nwith Solar System tests. In the present paper we construct several examples of such modified gravity where\nf (R) is presented implicitly, in terms of special functions.\nThe important remark is in order. It is well-known\nfact that arbitrary f (R) gravity may be presented in\nmathematically-equivalent form as minimal scalar-tensor\ntheory (Einstein gravity with scalar self-interacting field).\nEven more, it was shown [14, 15] that f (R) gravity may\nbe formulated in mathematically-equivalent form as Einstein gravity with ideal field having inhomogeneous equation of state. Then, it may look that it is not necessary to\nstudy modified gravity and it is enough to limit the consideration only by Einstein gravity with scalars and (or)\nideal fluid. However, the situation is more complicated.\nFor instance, modified gravity of specific form which describes acceptable accelerating universe (with realistic\neffective equation of state) is not physically equivalent\nto scalar-tensor theory [14, 15]. Hence, the equivalent\nscalar-tensor gravity may not lead to accelerating FRW\nuniverse (or, it may lead but with significally different\neffective equation of state). The corresponding examples\nwere given in [14, 15]. Moreover, specific form of modified gravity leads to specific form of scalar potential. As\n\n\f2\na result, such specific modified gravity may comply with\nSolar System tests (acceptable Newton law, etc) while\nthe corresponding scalar-tensor theory may not comply\nwith it and vice-versa. Hence, one should consider all\nthree classes of theories: modified gravity, scalar-tensor\ngravity and Einstein gravity with ideal fluid for description of dark energy and early universe. One should fit\nall these three classes of theories with astrophysical and\ncosmological constraints (the corresponding cosmological\nparameters are defined from different bounds in [16]) in\norder to find finally what is the realistic gravitational\ntheory compatible with observational data. In principle,\nIn this work we are not so ambitious to comply with all\nbounds. We intend to present the first realistic example of modified gravity which is compatible with Solar\nSystem tests, which is cosmologically viable (sequence of\nmatter dominated phase, transition from decceleration\nto acceleration, and acceleration phases) and which may\nlead even to \u039bCDM cosmology.\n\nThe paper is organized as follows. In the next section\nwe present general formulation to reconstruct the modified f (R) gravity for any FRW given cosmology (using\nthe auxiliary scalar field). This formulation is applied\nto work out several models. The explicit example of the\nmodel where matter-dominated phase may be realized\nby pure f (R) gravity (no matter) with subsequent transition to acceleration phase is presented. It is constructed\nthe model where the function f (R) is expressed in terms\nof Gauss hypergeometric functions and where the standard \u039bCDM cosmology is reproduced. For the specific\nversion of the modified f (R) gravity with matter it is\nshown that not only matter dominated phase with subsequent transition to acceleration occurs, but the acceleration epoch complies with three years WMAP data. In\norder to ensure that transition from decceleration to acceleration indeed occurs, the (in)stability analysis of the\ncosmological solutions is fulfilled. We also demonstrate\nthat corrections to Newton law for suggested versions of\nmodified gravity are negligible. Third section is devoted\nto consideration of the modified gravity model [6] with\ncompensating dark energy (ideal fluid). It is shown that\nthe role of such compensating dark energy may be to\nensure the transition from matter dominated to acceleration phase while during the current speed-up such compensating dark energy quickly disappears. Some outlook\nis given in the Discussion section. In the Appendix it\nis shown that our formulation is just equivalent to standard metric formulation of f (R) gravity (without extra\nscalar).\n\nII. RECONSTRUCTION OF MODIFIED\nGRAVITY WHICH DESCRIBES MATTER\nDOMINATED AND ACCELERATED PHASES\nA.\n\nGeneral formulation\n\nIn the present section we develop the general formulation of the reconstruction scheme for modified gravity\nwith f (R) action. It is shown how any cosmology may\ndefine the implicit form of the function f . The starting\naction of modified gravity is:\nZ\n\u221a\nS = d4 x \u2212gf (R) .\n(1)\nFirst we consider the proper Hubble rate H, which describes the evolution of the universe, with radiation dominance, matter dominance, and accelerating expansion. It\nturns out that one can find f (R)-theory realizing such a\ncosmology (with or without matter). The construction is\nnot explicit and it is necessary to solve the second order\ndifferential equation and algebraic equation. It shows,\nhowever, that, at least, in principle, we could obtain any\ncosmology by properly reconstructing a function f (R) on\ntheoretical level.\nThe equivalent form of above action is\nZ\n\u221a\nS = d4 x \u2212g {P (\u03c6)R + Q(\u03c6) + Lmatter } . (2)\nHere P and Q are proper functions of the scalar field\n\u03c6 and Lmatter is the matter Lagrangian density. Since\nthe scalar field does not have a kinetic term, it may be\nregarded as an auxiliary field (compare with ideal fluid\nrepresentation of f (R) gravity [14]). In fact, by the variation of \u03c6, it follows\n0 = P \u2032 (\u03c6)R + Q\u2032 (\u03c6) ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhich may be solved with respect to \u03c6:\n\u03c6 = \u03c6(R) .\n\n(4)\n\nBy substituting (4) into (2), one obtains f (R)-gravity:\nZ\n\u221a\nS =\nd4 x \u2212g {f (R) + Lmatter } ,\nf (R) \u2261 P (\u03c6(R))R + Q(\u03c6(R)) .\n\n(5)\n\nBy the variation of the action (2) with respect to the\nmetric g\u03bc\u03bd , we obtain\n1\n0 = \u2212 g\u03bc\u03bd {P (\u03c6)R + Q(\u03c6)} \u2212 R\u03bc\u03bd P (\u03c6)\n2\n1\n+\u2207\u03bc \u2207\u03bd P (\u03c6) \u2212 g\u03bc\u03bd \u22072 P (\u03c6) + T\u03bc\u03bd .\n(6)\n2\nThe equations corresponding to standard spatially-flat\nFRW universe are\ndP (\u03c6(t))\n0 = \u22126H 2 P (\u03c6) \u2212 Q(\u03c6) \u2212 6H\n+ \u03c1 , (7)\ndt\n\u0011\n\u0010\n0 =\n\n4\u1e22 + 6H 2 P (\u03c6) + Q(\u03c6)\n\n+2\n\nd2 P (\u03c6(t))\ndP (\u03c6(t))\n+ 4H\n+p .\ndt\ndt\n\n(8)\n\n\f3\nBy combining (6) and (7) and deleting Q(\u03c6), we find the\nfollowing equation\ndP (\u03c6(t))\nd2 P (\u03c6(t))\n\u2212 2H\n+ 4\u1e22P (\u03c6) + p + \u03c1 . (9)\n0=2\n2\ndt\nd\u03c6\nAs one can redefine the scalar field \u03c6 properly, we may\nchoose\n\u03c6=t.\n\n(10)\n\nIt is assumed that \u03c1 and p are the sum from the contribution of the matters with a constant equation of state\nparameters wi . Especially, when it is assumed a combination of the radiation and dust, one gets the standard\nexpression\n\u03c1 = \u03c1r0 a\u22124 + \u03c1d0 a\u22123 ,\n\np=\n\n\u03c1r0 \u22124\na ,\n3\n\n(11)\n\nwith constants \u03c1r0 and \u03c1d0 .

It\ngives (38) with (39). Especially when p\u00b1 = pi0 = 0\nexcept pdi , we find\n\u0001\n2 12h2 \u2212 13h + 2\n.\n(61)\n\u03c9=\n(2 \u2212 h)t\nHere the derivatives of h(\u03c6) like h\u2032 (\u03c6) are neglected again.\nThen \u03c9 goes to infinity when h = 2 and h \u2192 \u00b1\u221e and \u03c9\nvanishies when\n\u221a\n13 \u00b1 63\n= 0.87238 * * * , 0.2109478 * * * .\nh = h\u00b1 =\n24\n(62)\n\n\f7\nTherefore \u03c9 > 0 and the system is stable when h < h\u2212\nor h+ < h < 2. Hence, for the case that the universe\nstarts from decceleration phase with h = h0 < 1, if h0 >\nh+ , there is a stable solution where universe develops\nto the acceleration phase h \u2192 2 > 1. Even if we started\nwith h(\u03c6) = 2/3, which corresponds to matter dominated\nphase a \u223c t2/3 , the solution is unstable since h\u2212 < 2/3 <\nh+ , the perturbed solution could develop into the stable\nsolution with h > h+ and therefore there could be a\ntransition into the acceleration phase. If h goes to 2\nfrom the region with h < 2, since \u03c9 \u2192 +\u221e, the solution\nbecomes extremely stable. Hence, h may pass through\nthe point h = 2 and h could become larger than 2, where\nthe effective EOS parameter w = 1 \u2212 2/3h = 7/9.\nNote that when p\u00b1 = pi0 = 0 (i 6= d : dust), one gets\nR \u223c \u03c6\u22122 ,\n\nf (R) \u223c R3h/2 .\n\n(63)\n\nTherefore in the matter dominated phase h \u223c 2/3, the\naction behaves as the Hilbert-Einstein action.\nIn more general case that there is only one kind of\nmatter with w and p\u00b1 = 0, we find\n\b\n3h(\u03c6) 12 (1 + w) h(\u03c6)2 \u2212 2 (7 + 9w) h(\u03c6) + 4\n,\nR =\n{3 (1 + w) h(\u03c6) + 2} \u03c62\n3\n\nf (R) \u223c R 2 (1+w)h(\u03c6(R)) .\n\n(64)\n\nNote that \u03c9 in (60) is given by\n\nIn the expression (67), \u03c9 vanishes when h = h\u00b1 (62) and\nh = h\u0303\u00b1 , defined by\n\u221a\n4\u00b1 6\n= 0.6449 * * * , 0.15505 * * * .\nh\u0303\u00b1 \u2261\n10\nUnder the assumption (68), \u03c9 diverges at\n24\n\u01eb , h = h\u0303\u00b1 + \u01eb\u03b4\u00b1 ,\n25\n\u221a \u0001\n\u221a \u0001\n\u221a \u0001\n28 \u00b1 17 6 \u22126 \u00b1 6 16 \u00b1 6\n\u03b4\u00b1 \u2261 \u2213\n.

Near the singularities, if \u03c9 is negative, there\ncould be very large instability, which should be avoided.\nIn case p\u00b1 6= 0, the singularity could be avoided. The\npoints where \u03c9 vanishes could remain even if p\u00b1 6= 0\nbut the instability becomes finite and there can be a\nsolution which describes the transition from the matter\ndominated phase to the acceleration phase.\nWe now consider the case that the contribution from\nthe matter could be neglected in (38) and therefore we\ncould assume that pi0 = 0.

Note that there is big number of papers devoted\nto the study of newtonian regime in modified f (R) gravity [6, 8].

Therefore if the conditions in\n(88) are satisfied, the correction to the Newton law could\nbe neglected. In case of (42), if we choose p+ and p\u2212\nto satisfy (89) in the present universe, the correction to\nthe Newton law could be small. (It is interesting to note\nthat standard Newton law is valid also in an arbitrary\nF (G) gravity [23] where G is Gauss-Bonnett invariant).\nOne may consider even simpler situation: admitting that\nNewton law is satisfied only in current universe. Then,\nthe form of Newton law should be fixed only at present\nuniverse (in other words, the initial value of f (R) should\nbe restricted). We should also note that if P (\u03c6) changes\nits sign, as we identified P (\u03c6) with 1/\u03ba2 , there could\nappear the anti-gravitation effect. For instance, the form\nof modified gravity may be changed in the future, at the\nend of acceleration epoch, driving the Newton law to its\nopposite sign form.\nIII. MODIFIED GRAVITY AND\nCOMPENSATING DARK ENERGY\n\nIn the present section we will present another approach\nto modified gravity. Specifically, we discuss the modified gravity which successfully describes the acceleration\nepoch but may be not viable in matter dominated stage.\nIn this case, it is demonstrated that one can introduce\nthe compensating dark energy (some ideal fluid) which\nhelps to realize matter dominated and deccelerationacceleration transition phases. The role of such compensating dark energy is negligible in the acceleration epoch.\nWe now start with general f (R)-gravity action:\nZ\nS = d4 x {f (R) + Lmatter } .\n(93)\n\n(94)\n\nIf the Hubble rate is given (say, by observational data)\nas a function of t: H = H(t), by substituting such expression into (94), we find the t-dependence of \u03c1 and p as\n\u03c1 = \u03c1(t) and p = p(t). If one can solve the first equation\nwith respect to t as t = t(\u03c1), by substituting it into the\nsecond equation, an equation of state (EOS) follows:\np = p (t(\u03c1)) .\n\n(95)\n\nOf course, \u03c1 and p could be a sum with the contribution\nof several kinds of fluids with simple EOS.\nWe now concentrate on the case that f (R) is given\nby[6]\nf (R) = \u2212\n\nR\n\u03b1\n+ 2 + \u03b2R2 .\nn\nR\n2\u03ba\n\n(96)\n\nFurthermore, we write H(t) as Eq. (42) and assume h(t)\nis slowly varying function of t and neglect the derivatives\nof h(t) with respect to t. Then one gets (43).\nFirst we consider the case that the last term in (80)\ndominates f (R) \u223c \u03b2R2 , which may correspond to the\nearly (inflationary) epoch of the universe. It is not difficult to find\n36\u03b2 (\u22121 + 2h(t)) h(t)2\n,\nt4n\n36\u03b2 (\u22121 + 2h(t)) h (3h(t) + 1)\n.\np \u223c \u2212\nt4n\n\n\u03c1 \u223c \u2212\n\n(97)\n\nIf h goes to infinity, which corresponds to deSitter universe, we find \u03c1 \u223c p \u223c h3 although, from (43), R \u223c h4 .\nTherefore \u03c1, p \u226a \u03b2R2 and contribution form the matter\ncould be neglected. Then the inflation could be generated only by the contribution from the higher curvature\nterm.\nSecond, we consider the case that the second term in\nR\n(80) dominates f (R) \u223c 2\u03ba\n2 , which may correspond to\nthe matter dominated epoch after the inflation. In this\ncase \u03c1 and p behave as\n12h(t) + 6h(t)2\n,\n\u03ba 2 t2\n4h(t) \u2212 6h(t)2\np \u223c \u2212\n.\n\u03ba 2 t2\n\n\u03c1 \u223c\n\n(98)\n\nIn the matter\ndominated epoch, we expect h \u223c 2/3\n\u0011\n\u0010\n2\n3\na \u223c t . Hence, one gets\n\u03c1\u223c\n\n32\n,\n3\u03ba2 t2\n\np\u223c0.\n\n(99)\n\n\f10\nTherefore in the matter sector, dust with w = 0 (p = 0)\nshould dominate, as usually expected.\nFinally we consider the case that the first term in (93)\ndominates f (R) \u223c \u2212\u03b1/Rn , which might describe the acceleration of the present universe. The behavior of of \u03c1\nand p is given by\n\b\n\u03c1 \u223c \u03b1 6 (n + 1) (2n + 1) h(t) + 6 (n \u2212 2) h(t)2\n\b\n\u2212n\u22121 2n\nt ,\n\u00d7 \u22126h(t) + 12h(t)2\n\b\n\u0001\np \u223c \u03b1 \u22124n (n + 1) (2n + 1) \u2212 2 8n2 + 5n + 3 h(t)\n\u22126 (n \u2212 2) h(t)2\n\b\n\u00d7 \u22126h(t) + 12h(t)2\n\n\u2212n\u22121 2n\n\nt\n\n.\n\n(100)\n\nThus, the effective EOS parameter wl is given by\np\nwl \u2261\n\u03c1\n\b\n\u0001\n\u223c \u22124n (n + 1) (2n + 1) \u2212 2 8n2 + 5n + 3 h(t)\n\u22126 (n \u2212 2) h(t)2 {6 (n + 1) (2n + 1) h(t)\n+6 (n \u2212 2) h(t)2\n\n\u22121\n\n.\n\nwl \u2192 wf\n\b\n\u0001\n\u2261 \u22124n (n + 1) (2n + 1) \u2212 2 8n2 + 5n + 3 hf\n\u22126 (n \u2212 2) h2f {6 (n + 1) (2n + 1) hf\n\u22121\n\n,\n\n(102)\n\nand H(t) \u2192 hf /t. Since the matter energy density \u03c1wf\nwith the EoS parameter wf behaves as\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ\n\u03c1wf \u221d a\u22123(1+wf ) \u221d exp \u22123(1 + wf ) dtH(t) ,\n\n(103)\n\nthe energy density is\n\u03c1wf \u221d t\u22123(1+wf )hf .\n\n(104)\n\nComparing (104) with (100), we find\n2n = \u22123(1 + wf )hf ,\n\n(105)\n\nwhich can be confirmed directly from (102).\n\u00bfFrom the above consideration, we find \u03c1 and p contain\nmainly contributions from dust with w = 0, \u03c1d (t), p(t) =\n0 and \"dark energy\" with w = wl in (101), \u03c1l (t), pl (t).\nIn the expressions of \u03c1(t) and p(t) in (94), there might\nbe a remaining part:\n\u03c1R (t) \u2261 \u03c1(t)\u2212\u03c1d (t)\u2212\u03c1l (t) ,\n\npR = pR (\u03c1R ) ,\n\n(107)\n\nwhich may be called the compensating dark energy. More\nconcretely, according to (99), one may have\n\u03c1d \u223c\n\n32 \u22123 R tt dt h(t)\nt\n0\ne\n,\n3\u03ba2 t20\n\n(108)\n\nand according to (100),\n\b\n\u03c1l \u223c \u03b1 6 (n + 1) (2n + 1) hf + 6 (n \u2212 2) h2f\nR\n\b\n\u2212n\u22121 2n \u22123(1+wf ) t dt h(t)\nt\nt1\n(109)\n.\nt1 e\n\u00d7 \u22126hf + 12h2f\nIn (109), we choose t1 to be large enough. When t \u223c t0 ,\n\u03c1(t) \u223c \u03c1d and when t \u2192 \u221e, \u03c1(t) \u223c \u03c1l . Thus, \u03c1R only\ndominates after t = t1 but it becomes smaller in late\ntimes. Hence, the role of \u03c1R (which perhaps may be\nidentified partially with dark matter) is only to connect\nthe matter dominated epoch to the acceleration epoch.\n\n(101)\n\nIn order that the acceleration of the universe could occur,\nwe find h > 1. Let us now assume that h(t) \u2192 hf when\nt \u2192 \u221e. Then one obtains\n\n+6 (n \u2212 2) h2f\n\nexpression of (106), we obtain the EOS for the remaining\npart:\n\npR (t) \u2261 p(t)\u2212pl (t) , (106)\n\nwhich may help the transition from the matter dominated\nepoch to the acceleration epoch. By deleting t in the\n\nIV.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nIn summary, we developed the general formulation of\nmodified f (R) gravity which may be reconstructed for\nany given FRW metric. The resulting action is given in\nthe implicit form (usually, in terms of some special functions). Nevertheless, its early and late times asymptotics\nmay be defined, it turns out to have quite simple form,\nfor instance, as model [6] with negative and positive powers of curvature. Several examples predicted by realistic\ncosmology are constructed. These specific f (R) theories describe the sequence of cosmological epochs: matter dominated stage (if necessary even without matter),\ntransition from decceleration to acceleration and current cosmic speed-up consistent with three years WMAP\ndata. Moreover, the study of their newtonian regime\nindicates that such models are consistent with Solar System tests. It is not difficult to extend such a formulation\nto include consistently also radiation dominated phase\n(perhaps, even inflation). Hence, modified f (R) gravity indeed represents the realistic alternative to General\nRelativity, being more consistent in dark epoch. It is\nalso shown that some implicit version of f (R) gravity\nmay describe \u039bCDM cosmology without need to introduce the cosmological constant and without singularity\nnear R = 0.\nIn the alternative approach we also demonstrate that\neven simple models like the ones of ref.[6, 15] become\ncosmologically viable if compensating dark energy is introduced. It remains to study if such compensating dark\nenergy or the version of f (R) gravity which mimics matter dominated phase without matter may serve as dark\nmatter of the universe.\nDefinitely, more careful study of modified gravity\nand fitting the above models against the observational\n\n\f11\ndata/various constraints [16] should be done. First of all,\none should study the linear perturbations in the matterdominated epoch. Such a study made for scalar-GaussBonnet gravity model of ref.[24] in ref.[25] shows that\nthere is no really strong change if compare with usual\nGeneral Relativity. Hence, one may expect that the same\nwill occur in the present model while careful study should\nbe made, of course. It is also known [7] that Supernovae\nIa constraints are easy to fit in the class of models under consideration (subject to assumption that they are\ntreated as usual candles). Second, the CMBR peak locations are weakly model-dependent. Nevertheless, it is important to check constraints appearing from the CMBR\nshift parameter and baryon oscillations as well as nucleosynthesis bounds which restrict the amount of dark\nenergy in the current universe. Third, Solar System constraints (time variation of the effective gravitational constant, study of PPN parameters) should be considered\nin detail. The preliminary expectation is that this may\nbe achieved due to the fact of freedom of the form of\nmodified gravity (as well as first time derivative of the\ngravitational Lagrangian) at some specific (initial) time.\nThis will be investigated in detail elsewhere. Having in\nmind that new, more precise observational data will be\navailable soon, one may expect that the question: is modified gravity suitable as dark energy will be answered in\nnear future.\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nWe thank S.
