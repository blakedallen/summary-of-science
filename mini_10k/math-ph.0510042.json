The results obtained allow us to describe\nnew classes of nonlinear many-dimensional invariant equations.\n\nIntroduction\nThe concept of the invariant is widely used in various domains of mathematics. In this\npaper, we investigate the differential invariants within the framework of symmetry analysis of\ndifferential equations.\nDifferential invariants and construction of invariant equations were considered by S. Lie [1]\nand his followers [2, 3]. Tresse [2] had proved the theorem on the existence and finiteness of a\nfunctional basis of differential invariants. However, there exist quite a few papers devoted to the\nconstruction in explicit form of differential invariants for specific groups involved in mechanics\nand mathematical physics.\nKnowledge of differential invariants of a certain algebra or group facilitates classification of\nequations invariant with respect to this algebra or group. There are also some general methods for the investigation of differential equations which need tide explicit form of differential\ninvariants for these equations' symmetry groups (see e.g. [3, 4]).\nA brief review of our investigation of second-order differential invariants for the Poincar\u00e9\nand Galilei groups is given in [5, 6]. Our results on functional bases of differential invariants\nare founded on the Lemma about functionally independent warrants for the proper orthogonal\ngroup and two n-dimensional symmetric tensors of the order 2.\nWe should like to stress that we consider functionally independent invariants of but not\nirreducible ones, as in the classical theory of invariants.\nBases of irreducible invariants for the group O(3) and three-dimensional symmetric tensors\nand vectors are adduced in [7].\nThe definitions of differential invariants differ in various domains of mathematics, e.g. in\ndifferential geometry and symmetry analysis of differential equations. Thus, we believe that\nsome preliminary notes are necessary, though these formulae and definitions can be found in [8,\n9, 10].\nWe deal with Lie algebras consisting of the infinitesimal operators\nX = \u03be i (x, u)\u2202xi + \u03b7 r (x, u)\u2202ur .\n\n(0.1)\n\nHere x = (x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ), u = (u1 , . . . , um ). We usually mean the summation over the\nrepeating indices.\nDefinition 1. The function\nF = F (x, u, u, . . . , u),\n1\n\n1\n\nl\n\nActa Appl.

A maximal set of functionally independent invariants of order r \u2264 l of the Lie\nalgebra L is called a functional basis of the lth-order differential invariants for the algebra L.\nWe consider invariants of order 1 and 2 and need the first and second prolongations of the\noperator X (0.1) (see, e.g., [8\u201311])\n1\n\nX = X + \u03b7ir \u2202uri ,\n\n2\n\n1\n\nr\n\u2202urij\nX = X +\u03b7ij\n\nr taking the form\nthe coefficients \u03b7ir and \u03b7ij\n\n\u03b7ir = (\u2202xi + usi \u2202us )\u03b7 r \u2212 urk (\u2202xi + usi \u2202us )\u03be k ,\nr = (\u2202 + us \u2202 s + us \u2202 s )\u03b7 r \u2212 ur (\u2202 + us \u2202 s )\u03be k .\n\u03b7ij\nxi\nj u\nj u\nik xj\njk uk i\n\nWhile writing out lists of invariants, we shall use the following designations\nua \u2261\n\n\u2202u\n\u2202xa ,\n\nuab \u2261\n\n\u22022u\n\u2202xa \u2202xb ,\n\nSk (uab ) \u2261 ua1 a2 ua2 a3 * * * uak\u22121 ak uak a1 ,\nSjk (uab , vab ) \u2261 ua1 a2 * * * uaj\u22121 aj vaj aj+1 * * * vak a1 ,\n\n(0.3)\n\nRk (ua , uab ) \u2261 ua1 uak ua1 a2 ua2 a3 * * * uak\u22121 ak uak a1 .\nHere and further we mean summation over the repeated indices from 1 to n.

This basis will be further used to find\ninvariant bases for various algebras containing the Euclid algebra as a subalgebra - the Poincar\u00e9,\nGalilei, conformal, projective algebras, etc.\n1.1. The main results. Let us first formulate the main results of the section in the form\nof theorems.\nTheorem 1. There is a functional basis of second-order differential invariants for the Euclid\nalgebra AE(n) with the basis operators (1.1) for the scalar function u = u(x1 , . . . , xn ) consisting\nof these 2n + 1 invariants\nu,\n\nSk (uab ),\n\nRk (ua , uab ).\n\n(1.2)\n\nTheorem 2. The second-order differential invariants of the algebra AE(n) (1.1) for the set of\nscalar functions ur , r = 1, . . . , m, can be represented as functions of the following expressions:\nur ,\n\nSjk (u1ab , urab ),\n\nRk (ura , u1ab ).\n\n(1.3)\n\n1.2. Proofs of the theorems. Absolute differential invariants are obtained as solutions of\na linear system of first-order partial differential equations (PDE). Thus, the number of elements\nof a functional basis is equal to the number of independent integrals of this system. This number\nis equal to the difference between the number of variables on which the functions being sought\ndepend, and the rank of the corresponding system of PDE (in our case, this rank is equal to the\ngeneric rank of the prolonged operator algebra [8, 9].\nTo prove the fact that N invariants which have been found, F i = F i (x, u, u, . . . , u), form a\n1\n\nfunctional basis, it is necessary and sufficient to prove the following statements:\n\nl\n\n(1) the F i are invariants;\n(2) the F i are functionally independent;\n(3) the set of invariants F i is complete or N is equal to the difference of the number of variables\n(x, u, u, . . . , u) and the rank of the system of defining operators.\n1\n\nl\n\nWe seek second-order differential invariants in the form\nF = F (x, u, u, u).\n1 2\n\nIt follows from the condition of invariance with respect to translation operators \u2202a that F\ndoes not depend on xa ; evidently, u is an invariant of the operators (1.1). Thus, it is sufficient\nto seek invariants depending on u and u only. The criterion of the absolute invariance (0.1) in\nthis case has the form\n\n1\n\n2\n\nJ\u02c6ab F (u, u) = 0,\n\n(1.4)\n\n1 2\n\nwhere\nJ\u02c6ab = ura \u2202urb \u2212 urb \u2202ura + 2(urac \u2202urbc \u2212 urbc \u2202urac ),\n\n(1.5)\n\nthe summation over r from 1 to m being implied.\nIn that way, the problem of finding the second-order differential invariants of the algebra\nAE(n) is reduced to the construction of a functional basis for the rotational algebra AO(n) with\nthe basis operators (1.5) for m vectors and m symmetric tensors of order 2.\n3\n\n\fLemma 1. The rank of the algebra AO(n) is equal to (n(n \u2212 1))/2.\nProof. It is sufficient to prove the lemma for m = 1. The basis of the algebra (1.5) consists\nof (n(n \u2212 l))/2 operators. According to definition [8], its rank is equal to the generic rank of\nthe coefficient matrix of these operators. Let us put uab = 0 when a 6= b and write down the\ncoefficient columns by \u2202uab of the operators (1.5):\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nu11 \u2212 u22\n0\n***\n0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n0\nu11 \u2212 u33 * * *\n0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7.\n(1.6)\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\n***\n***\n***\n***\n0\n0\n* * * un\u22121,n\u22121 \u2212 unn\nWhen uaa 6= ubb for a 6= b and all uaa 6= 0, the determinant of the matrix (1.6) does not\nvanish, therefore its generic rank (that is, the generic rank the algebra being considered) cannot\nbe less than (n(n \u2212 1))/2. The lemma is proved.\nLemma 2. The expressions\nSk (uab ),\n\nRk (ua , uab )\n\n(1.7)\n\nare functionally independent.\nProof. To establish independence of expressions (1.7), it is sufficient to consider the case when\nuab = 0 if a =\n6 b and uaa 6= 0. Let us write down the Jacobian of the invariants\n1\n2u11\n***\nn\u22121\nnu11\n\n***\n***\n***\n***\n***\n\n1\n2unn\n***\nn\u22121\nnurr\n\n0\n(1.8)\n2u1\n***\n***\n***\nn\u22121\n2u1 u11\n***\n\n2un\n***\nn\u22121\n2un unn\n\nThe Jacobian (1.8) is equal up to a coefficient to the product of two Vandermonde determinants and is not equal to zero if uaa 6= ubb whenever a 6= b. Thus, the expressions (1.7) are\nfunctionally independent.\nProof of Theorem 1. The fact that expressions (1.2) are invariants of AO(n) can be easily\nproved by direct substitution of these expressions into the invariance conditions. Nevertheless,\nit is useful to note that Sk (uab ) are traces of the symmetric matrix (uab ) = U and its powers,\nRk (ua , uab ) are the scalar products of the vector (ua ) = (u1 , . . . , un ), the matrix U k\u22121 and the\nvector (ua )T .\nThe invariants for the vector (ua ) and the symmetric tensor (uab ) depend on their (n(n+3))/2\nelements. Thus, it follows from Lemma 1 that a functional basis of the algebra AO(n) for (ua )\nand (uab ) must consist of\nn(n + 3) n(n \u2212 1)\n\u2212\n= 2n\n2\n2\ninvariants.\nTherefore the set (1.7) is a complete set of functionally independent invariants of the form\nF = F (u, u) and (1.2) represents a functional basis of the second-order invariants for the algebra\n1 2\n\nAE(n). The theorem is proved.\n4\n\n\fLet us consider the case of two vectors (ua ), (va ) and two symmetric tensors of the second\norder (uab ), (vab ). The operators of the rotation algebra have the form (1.5), u \u2261 u1 , v \u2261 u2 .\nIn this case, a functional basis of invariants contains\n\u0012\n\u0013\nn(n \u2212 1)\nn(n \u2212 1)\nn(n + 7)\n2\n+ 2n \u2212\n=\n2\n2\n2\nelements for which we take the following expressions\nRk (ua , uab ),\n\nRk (va , uab ),\n\nSjk (uab , vab ).\n\n(1.9)\n\nThe invariance of expressions (1.9) with respect to the operators (1.5) can be easily proved\nby their direct substitution to (1.4). To establish their functional independence, we shall use\nthe following lemma.\nLemma 3. Let\nU = (uab )a,b=1,...,n ,\n\nV = (vab )a,b=1,...,n\n\nbe symmetric matrices. Then the expressions\nSjk (uab , vab ) = tr U j V k\u2212j ,\n\nj = 0, . . . , k; k = 1, . . . , n,\n\n(1.10)\n\nare functionally independent.\nProof. To prove Lemma 3, it is sufficient to show that the generic rank of the Jacobi matrix\nof expressions (1.10) is equal to (n(n + 3))/2 that is the difference between the number of\nindependent elements of U and V and the rank of the operators (1.5). We shall limit ourselves\nto the case when uab = 0 if a 6= b. Then equations (1.10) depend on (n(n + 3))/2 variables and\ntheir independence is equivalent to the nonvanishing of the Jacobian.\nLet us write down the elements of the Jacobian which are needed for further reasoning\n1\n2u11\n***\nn\u22121\nnu11\n\n***\n***\n***\n***\n***\n\n1\n2un\n***\nn\u22121\nnunn\n\n0\n.\n1\n0\n***\n2v11 4v12 * * *\n***\n\n0\n1\n***\n4v1n 2v22 * * *\n\n(1.11)\n\n1\n2vnn\n\nSince in the first n rows all the elements besides the first n columns are equal to j zero, the\nJacobian (1.11) is equal to the product of the Jacobian of the elements tr U k , k = 1, . . . , n, and\nthe Jacobian of all other elements. According to Lemma 2, the expressions tr U k , k = 1, . . . , n,\nare independent and their Jacobian is not equal to zero; thus, it remains to show the nonvanishing\nof the Jacobian and the functional independence only for the elements\ntr U j V k\u2212j ,\n\nj = 0, . . . , k \u2212 1; k = 1, . . . , n.\n\nIt follows from (1.11) that it is sufficient to show the nonvanishing of this Jacobian without\nthe (n+1)th rows and columns. Thus, to prove the lemma it is enough to show that the following\nexpressions are independent\ntr U j V k\u2212j V,\n\nj = 0, . . . , k; k = 1, . . . , n \u2212 1.\n5\n\n(1.12)\n\n\fThe above reasoning allows us to make use of the principle of mathematical induction.\nWhen n = 1, u11 and v11 are independent and the lemma is true. Let us suppose that it is\ntrue for n \u2212 1 and then prove from this that it is valid for n. Let the expressions\ntr U j V k\u2212j ,\n\nj = 0, . . . , k; k = 1, . . . , n \u2212 1,\n\n(1.13)\n\nwhere U , V are symmetric (n \u2212 1) \u00d7 (n \u2212 1) matrices and are independent. Then, we shall prove\nthe independence of (1.12) for the same matrices. The sets (1.12) and (1.13) coincide with the\nexception of the following subsets\ntr U j V n\u2212j ,\n\nj = 0, . . . , n \u2212 1\n\n(1.14)\n\nbelong only to (1.12) and\ntr U j ,\n\nj = 1, . . . , n \u2212 1\n\n(1.15)\n\nbelong only to (1.13).\nThe assumption of validity of the lemma for n \u2212 1 means that for two symmetric tensors\nof order 2, the set (1.13) is a functional basis of invariants of the rotation algebra. Thus, all\nthe invariants of this algebra can be represented as functions of (1.13). To prove the functional\nindependence of (1.12), it is sufficient to prove the nondegeneracy of the Jacobi matrix of the\nfunctions expressing the invariants (1.12) with (1.13). This matrix has the form\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n1\n0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n1\n***\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n.\n.\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n.\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7,\n(1.16)\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n0\n1\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\nW\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\nj\nn\u2212j\n\u2202(tr U V\n)\n0\n\u2202(tr U j )\nW being the derivative by tr V of the expression\ntr V n = F (tr V k , k = 1, . . . , n \u2212 1).\n(We know that from the Hamilton\u2013Cayley theorem); W 6= 0.\nWe have only to prove the nonvanishing of the Jacobian of the expressions\ntr (U j V n\u2212j ) = F (tr U k , k = 1, . . . , n \u2212 1, . . .).\n\n(1.17)\n\nWhen V = E, the corresponding quadrant of the matrix (1.16) is the unit matrix and its\ndeterminant does not vanish identically. This fact proves the nondegeneracy of the matrix\n(1.16). The expressions (1.17) can be obtained from the Hamilton\u2013Cayley theorem. They are\npolynomials and, thus, continuous functions of their arguments.\nFunctional independence of the expressions (1.12) for (n \u2212 1) \u00d7 (n \u2212 1) matrices implies their\nindependence for n \u00d7 n matrices. From the above, it follows that the expressions (1.10) are\nindependent, thus Lemma 3 is proved.\nProof of Theorem 2. It is easy to see from the structure of the set (1.3) that the invariants\n2\nm\n1\ninvolving (u1a ), . . . , (um\na ), (uab ), . . . , (uab ) depend on the components of (uab ) and of the corresponding vector or tensor, thus it is sufficient to prove the functions independence of each of the\nfollowing sets:\nRk (ura , u1ab )\nSjk (u1ab , urab )\n\nfor every r = 1, . . . , m;\nfor every r = 2, . . . , m;\n6\n\n\fFunctional independence of each set of Rk (ura , u1ab ) can be proved similarly to the proof of\nLemma 2. The functional independence of the set Sjk (u1ab , urab ) easily follows from Lemma 3, ur\nare evidently independent of other elements of (1.3).\nTo make sure that expressions (1.3) are invariants of AO(n), it is sufficient to substitute them\ninto the condition (1.4).\nThe set (1.3) consists of\n\u0012\n\u0013\nn(n + 1)\nn(n \u2212 1)\nn(n \u2212 1)\n2mn + m + (m \u2212 1)\n=m\n+n+1 \u2212\n2\n2\n2\nelements and, thus, it is complete.\nSo we have proved that this set forms a basis of invariants for the algebra AE(n) (1.1).\n1.3. Bases of invariants for the extended Euclid algebra and for the conformal\nalgebra. The extended Euclid algebra AE1 (n) for one scalar function is defined by the basis\noperators \u2202a , Jab (1.1) and D depending on a parameter \u03bb:\nD = xa \u2202a + \u03bbu\u2202u\n\n(\u2202u = \u2202/\u2202u).\n\n(1.18)\n\nThe basis of the conformal algebra AC(n) consists of the operators \u2202a , Jab (1.1) and D (1.18)\nand\nKa = 2xa D \u2212 xa xb \u2202a .\n\n(1.19)\n\nTheorem 3.

It is simpler\nto construct conformally covariant tensors from u, ua , uab and then to construct invariants of\nthe rotation algebra.\nDefinition 3. Tensors \u03b8a and \u03b8ab of order 1 and 2 are called covariant with respect to some\nalgebra L = hJab , Xi i if\ni \u03b8 + \u03c3i \u03b8 ,\nXi \u03b8a = \u03c3ab\na\nb\n\n(1.27)\n\nXi \u03b8ab = \u03c1iab \u03b8cb + \u03c1ibc \u03b8ac + \u03c1i \u03b8ab ,\n\ni , \u03c1i are some skew-symmetric\nXi are operators of the form (0.1), \u03c1i , \u03c3 i are some functions, \u03c3ab\nab\ntensors.\n\nIt is easy to show that the expressions Sk (\u03b8ab ), Rk (\u03b8a , \u03b8ab ), where \u03b8a , \u03b8ab are tensors covariant\nwith respect to the algebra L are relative invariants of this algebra.\nThe fact that \u03b8ab and wab (1.24) are covariant with respect to the conformal algebra AC(n)\ncan be verified by direct substitution of these tensors into the conditions (1.27) for the operators\n2\n\n2\n\nD and K a .\nThe rank of the second prolongation of the algebra AC(n) is equal to the number of its\noperators\nn(n + 3)\nn(n \u2212 1)\n+n+n+1 =\n+1\n2\n2\nand, therefore, a functional basis of second-order differential invariants must contain n invariants.\nFunctional independence of the expressions (1.22) follows from Lemma 2 if we notice that\nthe transformation uab \u2192 \u03b8ab is nondegenerated. The same is true for the set (1.23).\nThe expressions (1.22) and (1.23) satisfy (1.25) and (1.26) for the corresponding \u03bb and they\nare invariants of the conformal algebra.\nAll that is stated above leads to the conclusion that (1.22) and (1.23) form functional bases\nfor the conformal algebra AC(n) with \u03bb 6= 0 and \u03bb = 0, respectively.\n8\n\n\fNote 1. Using condition (1.26), it is easy to show that when \u03bb 6= 0 covariant tensors exist for\nAC(n) of order 2 only; when \u03bb = 0, the tensors wab (l.24) and ua are conformally covariant but\nSk (wab ) and Rk (ua , wab ) are dependent.\nTheorem 4.

The other invariants of the adduced basis (4.12) do not depend on \u03c6t or \u03c6tt and\nthe sets {M1 , M2 } and {Rk , Sk } are independent. The invariants Rk , Sk are constructed with\nthe covariant tensors \u03b8a , \u03c6ab (4.11) similarly to invariants of the conformal algebra investigated\nabove, and it is easy to see that they are independent.\nThe generic ranks of the prolonged algebras AGI (1, n), AGI1 (1, n), AGI2 (1, n) are equal to the\nnumbers of their operators and from this fact we can compute the number of elements in the\nbases for these algebras.\nAdding to (4.7) and (4.8) the condition (4.9), we obtain from the invariants (4.12) the basis\n(4.13) for the algebra AGI1 (1, n).\nRelative invariants R\u0302k , \u015ck (4.15) of the algebra AGI2 (1, n) were found from the equation\n\u03bbF\u03c6t \u2212 2\u03c6t F\u03c6tt \u2212 \u03c6a F\u03c6at + \u03bc\u03b4ab F\u03c6ab = 0,\nF = F (Rk , Sk ), and then we constructed absolute invariants using (4.9). Besides, it is possible\nto construct analogues to R\u0302k , \u015ck with AGI2 (1, n)-covariant tensors \u03b8a (4.11) and\n\u03b8ab = \u03c6ab \u2212\n\n2\u03b4ab\n(\u03c6c \u03c6c + \u03bc\u03c6t ).\nn\n\nConsidering (\u03c6at ), (\u03c6a ), (\u03c6ab ) as independent vectors and tensors and putting \u03c6ab = 0 whenever a 6= b, \u03c6a = 0, we see from Lemma 2 that the adduced sets of invariants are independent.\nNote 2.

Let us adduce a functional basis for the algebra AGII\n2 (1, n).\n(1) when \u03bb = 0, then there is a basis consisting of the following expressions:\nN12\n,\nN22\n\nN1\u22172\n,\nN2\n\n(Sjk )2\n,\nN1k\n\nN1 e(4/\u03bb)(\u03c6+\u03c6 ) ,\n\nN1\u2217\n,\nN1\n\nN3 e(3/\u03bb)(\u03c6+\u03c6 ) ,\n\n\u03c6 + \u03c6\u2217 ,\n\n(Rkl )2 N1\u2212k\u22121 (l = 1, 2, 4);\n\n(2) \u03bb 6= 0:\n\u2217\n\n\u2217\n\n(Rkl )2\n(l = 1, 2, 3),\nN1k\n\n(Sjk )2\n,\nN1k\n\nwhere\nN1 = (\u03c6t \u2212 \u03b8a \u03c6a )2 + (\u03c6tt \u2212 \u03b8a \u03c6at )(\u03bb + \u03c6a \u03c6ab rab )\n(with {rab } = {\u03c6ab }\u22121 and \u03b8a = rab \u03c6bt ),\n\u2217 \u2212 (\u03c6\u2217 \u2212 \u03c6\u2217 \u03b8 \u2217 )\u03c6 \u03c6 r ,\nN2 = (\u03c6t \u2212 \u03c6c \u03b8c )\u03c6\u2217a \u03c6\u2217b rab\na b ab\nc c\nt\nN3 = (\u03c6t \u2212 \u03c6\u2217t ) \u2212 \u03c4a (\u03c6a \u2212 \u03c6\u2217a ) (\u03c4a (\u03bb\u03c6ab + \u03c6a \u03c6b ) = \u03c6b \u03c6t + \u03bb\u03c6bt ),\nRk1 = Rk (\u03c6a , \u03c6ab ), Rk2 = Rk (\u03c6\u2217a , \u03c6ab ), Rk3 = Rk (\u03b8a \u2212 \u03b8a\u2217 , \u03c6ab ),\n\u2217 ) \u2212 \u03c6 \u03c6 r (\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8 \u2217 )).\nRk4 = Rk (\u03c1a , \u03c6ab ) (\u03c1a = (\u03c6t \u2212 \u03b8b \u03c6b )(\u03c6\u2217c rac \u2212 \u03c6c rac\nb d bd a\na\n17\n\n\fThe proof of this theorem will be easier if we notice that by putting \u03bc = im in (4.4), we\nobtain operators similar to the operators (4.2).\nThe change of variables (4.5) in the adduced invariants allows us to obtain bases for the algebras AGI2 and AGII\n2 in the representations (4.2) and (4.4). These results can also be generalized\nfor the case of several scalar functions.\n4.3. Let us present some examples of new invariant equations\n\u0001\n\b\n\u03c6tt + \u03bc12 2\u03bc n1 \u03c6t \u03c6aa + \u03c6a \u03c6t + \u03c6a \u03c6b \u03c6ab + n1 \u03c6a \u03c6a \u03c6bb + n1 \u03c62bb =\n= (2\u03bc\u03c6t + \u03c6a \u03c6a + \u03c6aa )2 F,\n\n\u0001\n\u2212m2 \u03c6tt + 2im \u03c6a \u03c6at + n1 \u03c6t \u03c6aa + \u03c6a \u03c6b \u03c6ab + n1 \u03c6a \u03c6a \u03c6bb + n1 \u03c62aa =\n= (2im\u03c6t + \u03c6a \u03c6a + \u03c6aa )2 F.\n\n(4.18)\n\n(4.19)\n\nEquations (4.18) and (4.19) are invariant, respectively, under the algebras\nAGI2 (1, n), \u03bc 6= 0 (4.2), and AGII\n2 (1, n), m 6= 0 (4.4). The F 's are arbitrary functions of\nthe invariants for corresponding algebras.\nEvidently, wide classes of invariant equations can be constructed with the adduced invariants.\n5. Conclusion\nIt is well-known that a mathematical model of physical or some other phenomena must obey\none of the relativity principles of Galilei or Poincar\u00e9. Speaking the language of mathematics, it\nmeans that the equations of the model must be invariant under the Galilei or the Poincar\u00e9 groups.\nHaving bases of differential invariants for these groups (or for the corresponding algebras), we\ncan describe all the invariant scalar equations, or sort the invariant ones out of a set of equations.\nThe construction of differential invariants for vector and spinor fields presents more complicated problems. The first-order invariants for a four-dimensional vector potential had been\nfound in [18]. The cases of spinor and many-dimensional vector Poincar\u00e9-invariant equations\nand corresponding bases of invariants are still to be investigated.\nNote 5. After having prepared the present paper, we became acquainted with the article [19]\nwhere realizations of the Poincar\u00e9 group P (1, 1) and the corresponding conformal group were\ninvestigated, and all second-order scalar differential equations invariant under these groups were\nobtained. Reference [19] contains bases of absolute differential invariants of the order 2 for the\nPoincar\u00e9, the similitude, and the conformal groups in (1 + 1)-dimensional Minkowski space for\nvarious realizations of the corresponding Lie algebras.\nNote 6. It was noticed by the referee that an essential misunderstanding arose in the calculation\nof second prolongations for differential operators, e.g. in formulae (1.5) and (1.25).\nWhen we calculate such prolongations with the usual Lie technique (see, e.g., [8]), we imply\nthat action of an operator of the form X ab \u2202uab , where X ab are some functions, is as follows\nX ab \u2202uab (ucd ucd ) = 2X ab uab ,\n\n\u2202uab ucd = \u03b4ac \u03b4bd .\n\nWith this assumption, \u2202uab uba = 0, a 6= b.\nOtherwise, the second prolongation of the operator Jab (1.1) will be of the form\n2\n\nJab = Jab + J\u02c6ab ,\nJ\u02c6ab = ua \u2202ub \u2212 ub \u2202ua + uac \u2202ubc \u2212 ubc \u2202uac + uab (\u2202ubb \u2212 \u2202uaa ).\n18\n\n\fNote 7. The equations which are conditionally invariant with respect to the Poincar\u00e9 and\nGalilei algebras were investigated in [20, 21].\nAcknowledgement.
