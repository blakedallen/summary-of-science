Introduction\nThe nucleon (proton or neutron) is a suitable object for our curiosity in view of the fact\nthat it accounts for most of the directly visible mass of the universe. Half a century\nago, elastic electron-proton scattering provided direct experimental evidence [1] that\nthe proton has a finite size of about 1 fm. (With the benefit of hindsight, we now\nrealize that its already-known large anomalous magnetic moment could already have\nbeen interpreted to indicate that it is not a point-like object [2].) The amazing variety\nof baryons and mesons discovered using new multi-GeV proton accelerators in the 1950's\nand 1960's demanded some explanation in terms of an underlying structure that would\nunify their observed quantum numbers and decay modes. Such a composition in terms\nof more elementary fractionally charged spin- 12 particles called 'quarks' was postulated\nin 1964 [3, 4]. Then the internal structure of the proton came under direct experimental\nobservation in the late 1960's at the SLAC laboratory, where an intense electron beam\nbecame available with an energy large compared to the relevant scale of \u223c 1 GeV. In\nthese now-famous Deep-Inelastic Scattering (DIS) experiments, a substantial amount\nof energy and momentum is transferred to the proton target, causing it to disintegrate.\nIn 1969, it was hypothesized that the energy and momentum was being transferred to\ninternal constituents of the proton, called 'partons' [5]. Information about the properties\nof the constituents can be inferred from the distribution of the scattering cross section\nin these measured transfers. In the same exciting year, it was realized that the data\nshowed a property called 'scaling' [6]: at large enough momentum transfer, the kinematic\ndependence of the cross section resembles that for elastic scattering off point-like charged\nparticles that might be identified with those partons. As the properties of the cross\nsection also indicated that the partons have spin 21 , it became accepted that the charged\npartons could be assumed to be the hypothesized quarks. However, it emerged that the\ntotal momentum carried by observed quarks accounts for only about half of the proton's\nmomentum. This suggested that there must also be electrically neutral partons, possibly\nbeing exchanged by quarks to provide their binding force, leading to the name 'gluons'.\nThen in the early 1970's, an elegant field theory was devised to explain this binding,\nas well as the observed weakening of this force at short distances or large momentum\ntransfers, known as 'asymptotic freedom' [7,8]. This theory became known as Quantum\nChromodynamics (QCD), the contemporary standard theory of strong interactions.\nThe QCD Lagrangian can be written in one line. Nevertheless, as in other fields\nof science, simple rules can give rise to complex behaviour. The unique richness of this\nfield theory accounts for the challenge presented by the study of hadron structure. The\nQCD vacuum is believed to resemble a 'dual superconductor', which, unlike conventional\nQED superconductors, repells color electric fields rather than magnetic fields. Unlike\nin QED, where vacuum polarization screens charges as their separation increases, the\nQCD vacuum provides anti-screening that results in a rapidly increasing ('running')\nQCD coupling constant \u03b1s at larger distance scales or smaller momentum transfer.\nMoreover, the analogue of the dual Meissner effect in a superconductor leads in the\n\n\fSpin-polarized high-energy scattering of charged leptons on nucleons\n\n4\n\nQCD vacuum to the formation of a color flux tube connecting quarks and antiquarks in\nthe same way as the magnetic flux connecting two magnetic monopoles in a conventional\n(QED) superconductor would be squeezed into narrow flux tubes. This apparently leads\nto the phenomenon of confinement, as free quarks are not observed, although no proof\nhas been found for the theorem that confinement inevitably follows from QCD. In any\ncase, the quantitative prediction of hadron properties in QCD is presently subject to\nuncontrolled approximations. Laborious simulations on a Euclidian lattice are now\nproducing such predictions for an increasing number of observables. In contrast, the\nasymptotic freedom of QCD at short distances allows precise perturbative treatment\nof hard interactions. Hence such hard interactions with bound partons can be used to\nexperimentally probe the structure of hadrons. A good representative for the energies\nthat are required to reach the perturbative regime is provided by the scale parameter\n\u039bQCD . While this parameter appears also in the description of the running of the QCD\ncoupling, it provides a rough estimate about the scale of many nonperturbative effects,\nsuch as the energy density needed to break the superconducting phase. The numerical\nvalue of \u039bQCD depends somewhat on the renormalization procedure (scheme) that is\nused in its definition, but a value \u039bQCD \u2248 200\u2013300 MeV provides a good scale for\nestimates of the relevance of effects governed by the nontrivial QCD vacuum structure.\nQuark kinetic energy together with QCD field energy accounts for most of the mass\nof the nucleon, which in turn accounts for most of the mass of the visible universe. Hence\nthe nucleon is a worthy subject of investigation. Deep-Inelastic Scattering of leptons has\ncontinued to provide most of our present knowledge of nucleon structure. As shown in\ne'\np'\ne\n\np\nq\n\n\u03b3*\n\nu\nu\n\nN\n\nh\nd\n\nP\n\nh\n\u03c0\n\n+\n\n\u03c0\n\nFigure 1. Simplified schematic diagram of semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering.\nThe large shaded arrows represent typical helicities, as described later in the text.\n\nfigure 1, a virtual photon \u03b3 \u2217 emitted by the incident lepton e and absorbed by a bound\nquark of flavour up (u) or down (d) in the nucleon N has space-like four-momentum\nq that can be inferred in inclusive measurements in which only the scattered lepton e'\nis detected. The motion of the mostly low-mass u and d flavours of quarks populating\n\n\fSpin-polarized high-energy scattering of charged leptons on nucleons\n\n5\n\nthe proton is highly relativistic. Hence virtual quark-antiquark pairs are abundant and\nmay be manifest in suitable processes. (In the general context of DIS, the word 'quarks'\ncan be taken to also include antiquarks.) The relativistic motion also implies that DIS\nresults are best interpreted in a reference frame where the target proton has 'infinite'\nmomentum opposite to that of the incident virtual photon. One may intuitively think of\nthis tactic as freezing the transverse motion of the partons during the interaction time\nthrough time dilatation (while remembering that their intrinsic transverse momentum\npT is of course invariant under such a boost). A virtual photon has adequate spatial\nresolution to resolve the target's internal structure [9] if its virtuality Q2 \u2261 \u2212q 2 is\nsufficiently large, a requirement empirically found to be at least Q2 > 1 GeV2 . Given\nthis condition, a key experimental observable is the distribution of cross sections in the\nBjorken scaling variable xB \u2261 Q2 /(2P * q). In the infinite-momentum frame, xB can be\ninterpreted as the fraction x of the proton's four-momentum P that was carried by the\nquark before it was struck by the virtual photon. Thus we distinguish here between the\nexperimentally obervable kinematic variable xB and the theoretical concept of x as a\nparton momentum fraction. Only in the parton-model approximation to the DIS process\ncan they be equated. In this framework, the dependence of the DIS cross section on\nxB provides information about the x-distribution of partons in the target (often called\nParton Distribution Functions or PDFs). For a hypothetical hadron consisting of three\nnon-relativistic quarks with the same large mass, this distribution would be a \u03b4-function\nat x = 31 . For systems of light quarks, this is far from being the case.\nPDFs can be considered to be intrinsic properties of hadrons only if they are\n'universal', i.e. if they can be applied in descriptions of various hard processes involving\nthe same hadron. Asymptotic freedom of QCD has provided the means to overcome\nits complicating aspects to prove profound 'factorization theorems' showing that cross\nsections for several experimentally important hard processes can be represented as a\nproduct of a cross section for one or more perturbatively calculable partonic subprocesses\nand one or more non-perturbative but universal parton distributions. For the case\nof a DIS cross section \u03c3(xB , Q2 ) in the Bjorken limit Q2 \u2192 \u221e at fixed xB , the\nquark distribution qf (xB , Q2 ) appears in a sum over quark and anti-quark flavours\n \u0304 s\u0304 . . . weighted by the squares of their electric charges ef in units of\nf = u, d, s, \u016b, d,\nthe elementary charge:\nX\n\u03c3(xB , Q2 ) \u221d\ne2f qf (xB , Q2 ) .\n(1)\nf\n\nA key feature here is the incoherence between the amplitudes for the various quark\nflavours. At least in the Bjorken limit, this may be understood to be associated with the\npossible distinguishability of hadronic final states arising from different quark flavours, so\nthat interference can't arise. Parton distributions such as qf (x, Q2 ) have probabilistic\ninterpretations as parton number densities. At finite values of Q2 , the relationship\nbetween PDFs and observable cross sections is only a fairly crude approximation at\nleading order in \u03b1s as in (1), so the perturbative expansion is continued to Next-toLeading-Order (NLO) or even further. Based on the extensive available data set for DIS\n\n\fSpin-polarized high-energy scattering of charged leptons on nucleons\n\n6\n\nas well as other processes, there is now available a precise (except at very small or large\nx) parameterization of x distributions of the u and d 'valence' quarks that determine\nthe quantum numbers of the proton, and less precisely of the virtual 'sea' quarks that\n \u0304 and strange (s, s\u0304).\ncan be produced by gluon splitting, such as anti-up (\u016b), d,\nThe dependence of parton distributions on the 'hard scale' Q2 of the process is weak\n(logarithmic), and can be understood to arise from the finer spatial resolution of a probe\nat a harder scale, which allows it to resolve more of the virtual partons that 'dress' each\nquark. These virtual q q\u0304 or gluon pairs are abundant because their small or zero mass\nmakes them energetically inexpensive. With quantum fluctuations so important at short\ndistances, the 'appearance' of the nucleon depends on how it is probed. This might be\nconsidered to be analogous to the familiar change in appearance of a macroscopic object\nwhen viewed in light of different colours or wavelengths, due in part to the interactions\nbetween the atoms of its surface. Unlike the x dependence, the Q2 dependence of\nparton distributions is perturbatively calculable in QCD at large enough Q2 . Thus a\ndistribution that is known over the range x0 < x < 1 (or alternatively 0 < x < x0 ) for\none value of Q2 can be 'evolved' to the distribution over the same x-range at a larger\n(smaller) value of Q2 , using the so-called DGLAP integro-differential equations [10\u201312].\nThe evolution kernels for several parton distributions have been computed up to Nextto-Next-to-Leading-Order (NNLO) in \u03b1s [13\u201316], meaning that participation of gluons\nin hard QCD interactions are taken into account. Gluons may be created in these hard\ninteractions, or they may be found in the target nucleon. Hence, at order \u03b1s or higher,\nthe DGLAP equations couple the distributions for quarks and gluons. This feature has\nbeen exploited in global fits of all available inclusive DIS data, which cover a range in\nQ2 from 1 to 50 GeV2 , to extract information about the gluon distribution G(x). From\nthis and other types of data, G(x) is now quite well determined except at small x with\nmoderately small Q2 . For convenience in the rest of this paper, we suppress the Q2\ndependence of distributions in our notation.\nParton distributions depend on the order of perturbation theory relating them to\nexperimental observables. Beyond leading order in \u03b1s , they lose their probabilistic\ninterpretation as number densities, and can even become negative. However, at\neach order, they remain universal among various observable processes in which they\nparticipate, and hence are still much more than just parameterizations. Furthermore,\ntheir basic construction is motivated by simple semiclassical parton-model ideas, but\nimplemented to account for the intricacies of a quantum system.\nFor values of Q2 below \u223c 10 GeV2 , there may be additional contributions to the\ncross section that scale as 1/Qn , n > 0. These may be corrections arising because\nthe mass of the target nucleon is not negligible compared to Q2 , or they may be due\nto 'higher-twist' subprocesses, in which an additional parton in the target nucleon\nexperiences a hard interaction. (Some authors apply the term 'higher twist' for all\n'power-suppressed' terms, even those suppressed by factors of 1/Qn arising only because\nof kinematic relationships. In this case, contributions involving an additional parton are\ndesignated as 'interaction dependent' or 'dynamical higher twist'.) For DIS processes,\n\n\f7\n\nSpin-polarized high-energy scattering of charged leptons on nucleons\n\nleading twist is twist-2, with no such contributions,\nBaryons are the fermionic bound states of the spin- 12 quarks. All known baryons\nhave quantum numbers consistent with those of a set of three quarks of particular\nflavours. (Bound states of 5 or more quarks are theoretically possible, and in fact such\nwave function components may contribute to the ground states of ordinary baryons such\nas the proton.) Soon after the conception of quarks as the constituents of the nucleon,\nnonrelativistic models were constructed in which the mass the the nucleon was directly\nattributed to three massive quarks. One of the successes of these models was considered\nto be the remarkable consistency of the measured magnetic moments of many baryons\nwith a combination of Dirac magnetic moments of their three 'constituent quarks'.\nThen in the 1970's, the internal spin structure of the proton came under\ninvestigation via DIS of helicity-polarized lepton beams on hydrogenous targets\ncontaining protons polarized with the beam axis as quantization axis, i.e. longitudinal\npolarization. The exchanged virtual photon inherits the helicity of the beam lepton, to a\ndegree that depends on the lepton kinematics. Due to conservation of helicities in hard\nor short-distance interactions, only quarks with the opposite spin direction (i.e. same\nhelicity) as the spin-1 photon can absorb it in the leading-order process \u03b3 \u2217 q \u2192 q (see\nfigure 2). Hence the 'polarized virtual-photon beam' selects quarks of one helicity. From\n\nFigure 2. Visualization of scattering of longitudinally polarized leptons and protons.\n\nthe difference in cross sections with same or opposite polarizations of beam and target,\n\u2192\nit is therefore possible to extract the number densities of quarks having the same (qf\u21d2 )\n\u2192\n\nor opposite (qf\u21d0 ) helicity as the target proton in the infinite momentum frame. Here the\nsymbol \u2192(\u21d2) designates the helicity of the quark (target proton). The quark helicity\n\u2192\n\u2192\ndistribution \u2206qf (x) is then defined as \u2206qf (x) = qf\u21d2 (x) \u2212 qf\u21d0 (x), while the polarization\u2192\n\n\u2192\n\naveraged distribution qf (x) introduced above can be written qf (x) = qf\u21d2 (x) + qf\u21d0 (x).\nFrom these definitions, the obvious 'positivity limit' arises: |\u2206qf (x)| < qf (x) The\ndistribution qf (x) [\u2206qf (x)] is sometimes written as f1q (x) [g1q (x)], although this is\narguably confusing, because the spin structure functions f1 and g1 are defined to be\nfunctions of the observable kinematic quantity xB , while the parton distributions are\n\n\fSpin-polarized high-energy scattering of charged leptons on nucleons\n\n8\n\ndefined to be functions of the parton momentum fraction x, with the relations between\nthem being subject to approximations such as single-photon exchange and the quarkparton model. For convenience hereafter, we use the term '(un)polarized' to describe\nmeasurements, cross sections or parton distributions, meaning (polarization averaged)\npolarization dependent. Polarized PDFs evolve logarithmically with Q2 according to a\nset of DGLAP equations that differs somewhat from those for the unpolarized case.\nCertain x-moments of parton distributions (integrals over x weighted with xn ) have\nimportant physical interpretations. First (n = 0) moments can be conveniently written\nR\nas e.g. \u2206qf \u2261 dx \u2206qf (x). A quantity that has played a central role in the discussion of\nP\nnucleon spin structure in recent decades is the flavour sum \u2206\u03a3 \u2261 f \u2206qf , as it can be\ninterpreted as the net contribution of the quark helicities to the spin of the nucleon. (At\nthe present precision of the field, the proton and neutron can be considered to be related\nby isospin symmetry.) Note that contributions of individual quark flavours may tend to\ncancel one another in this sum. A pivotal event in this field in the late 1980's was the\nDIS measurement with longitudinal polarization of both muon beam and hydrogenous\ntarget by the EMC experiment [17, 18] at the CERN laboratory, which for the first\ntime extended over a wide enough range in xB that \u2206\u03a3 could be inferred, albeit under\nthe assumption of SU(3) flavour symmetry (neglecting the effects of the \u223c 100 MeV\nmass of the strange quark), which allows use of additional constraints from measured\nweak decay lifetimes of hyperons. The surprisingly small resulting value suggested that\nquark helicities make little net contribution to the nucleon spin, in contrast to naive\nexpectations based on the baryon magnetic moments mentioned above. In language\nthat with the benefit of hindsight may now seem extravagant, this finding was called\na 'spin crisis', and inspired more than a thousand theoretical papers attempting its\ninterpretation, and several new experiments with the aim of confirming the measurement\nwith higher precision, and extending it to include the 'neutron' target.\nBecause of the relativistic nature of bound systems of light quarks, there exists\na third independent flavour-set of quark distributions that have a probabilistic\ninterpretation as number densities. These quark transversity distributions \u03b4qf (x) are\nneeded to describe the transverse (\u2191) polarization of quarks in a nucleon polarized\ntransversely (\u21d1) with respect to its infinite momentum: \u03b4qf (x) \u2261 qf\u2191\u21d1 (x) \u2212 qf\u2191\u21d3 (x). Their\nprobabilistic interpretation applies only in a basis of transverse spin eigenstates, not in\nthe helicity basis relevant for the \u2206qf (x). The distribution \u03b4qf (x) is sometimes written\nas hq1 (x), although this might be misleading because no spin structure function h1 (xB )\nis defined. There exists little experimental information about transversity, because the\ncoupling of hard vector bosons to quarks is insensitive to the transverse polarization\nof the quark, unless the transverse polarization of the struck quark in the final state\nis 'measured'. However, some traces of this transverse polarization appear in the\nstructure of the 'jet' of final-state particles produced by the energetic struck quark.\nInformation about transversity has begun to emerge from semi-inclusive measurements\nwith transverse target polarization, which include the detection of one or more hadrons\nin addition to the scattered lepton (see figure 1).\n\n\fSpin-polarized high-energy scattering of charged leptons on nucleons\n\n9\n\nAll parton distributions actually have a two-dimensional dependence on both x\nand the intrinsic quark momentum component pT transverse to the nucleon's 'infinite'\nmomentum. This two-dimensional dependence does not factorize. The three flavour-sets\nof distributions mentioned above that have probabilistic interpretations are considered\nbasic in the sense that they survive integration over pT , and it is this integral that is\nsignified when only the x argument appears. Five other sets of distributions have been\nidentified that also have probabilistic interpretations but do not survive such integration.\nSome of these have been found to be particularly interesting, as in DIS they embody\nthe effects of a 'final-state interaction' between the departing struck quark and the\nremainder of the target nucleon. The contribution of such a distribution to the cross\nsection depends on polarization and momentum vectors in a manner that is called 'Todd', although this does not refer to fundamental time symmetry. The study of these\nT-odd effects has provoked a reconsideration of the meaning of parton distributions and\ntheir universality. Experimental evidence for T-odd effects has now been observed in the\nsame semi-inclusive data from which information about transversity has been extracted.\nThe dependence of the elastic lepton-nucleon cross section on the momentum\ntransfer is represented by the elastic 'form factor', as its Fourier transform can be\ninterpreted as the spatial charge distribution in the nucleon. Up until about a decade\nago, information about hadron structure embodied in elastic form factors and in\nPDFs were interpreted separately. It was then discovered that these concepts could\nbe unified in what became known as Generalized Parton Distributions (GPDs), also\ncalled off-forward or skewed parton distributions. Even more profound was the finding\nthat the dependence of these GPDs on three kinematic variables encodes much more\ndetailed information, about e.g. parton orbital angular momentum [19] and correlations\nbetween transverse position and longitudinal momentum fraction of partons [20\u201323].\nOf particular interest is that a second moment of a certain combination of GPDs for\neach parton flavour was found to represent the total (helicity plus orbital) contribution\nof that flavour to the spin of the nucleon [19]. This offers the first opportunity for\nexperimental access to parton orbital angular momentum, as it was discovered that the\nadditional information could in principle be obtained from experimental studies of hard\nexclusive processes involving additional hard interaction(s), yet 'replacing' the struck\nquark in the target nucleon to leave it intact. Most prominent among these processes\nis Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering (DVCS), the hard exclusive production of an\nenergetic real photon. Within the last decade, rapid theoretical progress has been made\nin understanding this new subject, and several DVCS observables have been measured.\nThus the evolution of our understanding of nucleon spin structure might be\nimaginatively summarized by figure 3.\n\n\fSpin-polarized high-energy scattering of charged leptons on nucleons\n\n10\n\nFigure 3. Illustration of nucleon structure. Left: valence quarks only. Middle: Gluons\nand quark-antiquarks in addition. Right: Orbital angular momentum of quarks.\n\n2. The longitudinal spin structure of the nucleon\n2.1. Introduction\nAs mentioned above, parton distributions have been investigated experimentally using\nDIS of lepton beams. In order to measure helicity distributions \u2206qf (x), both beam and\ntarget must be longitudinally polarized. The relevant observable is the difference in\ncross sections with same or opposite polarizations of beam and target:\n\u2192\n1 \u2192\n(2)\n\u03c3LL (xB ) \u2261 [\u03c3 \u21d2 (xB ) \u2212 \u03c3 \u21d0 (xB )] .\n2\nHowever, measurements of absolute cross sections are technically difficult with polarized\ntargets. Hence the experimental results are typically extracted from the data as 'doublespin' asymmetries:\n\u03c3LL (xB )\nA|| (xB ) \u2261\n(3)\n\u03c3U U (xB )\nwhere L (U) designates Longitudinal polarization (Unpolarized) appearing in pairs\ncorresponding to beam followed by target. The polarization-averaged cross section\n\u2192\n1 \u2192\n(4)\n\u03c3U U (xB ) \u2261 [\u03c3 \u21d2 (xB ) + \u03c3 \u21d0 (xB )]\n2\nhas been previously measured precisely using unpolarized targets. Using these known\nvalues and measured values of A|| , \u03c3LL can be extracted. This approach based on cross\nsections avoids confusions that sometimes arise. For example, it has been proposed\nthat, if the values of \u03c3LL are interpreted theoretically in leading order, then the\nvalues of \u03c3U U should be calculated in leading order from a theoretical representation in\nterms of parton distributions, neglecting the portion involving so-called 'longitudinal'\nvirtual photons!\u2021 This misses the key point that \u03c3U U became involved only because\n\u2021 Longitudinal virtual photons are those having 'magnetic' quantum number m = 0 with respect to\nthe quantization axis along the photon momentum direction, while photons with 'magnetic' quantum\n\n\fSpin-polarized high-energy scattering of charged leptons on nucleons\n\n11\n\nof the experimental convenience of asymmetry measurements, and is irrelevant to the\ntheoretical intepretation of spin observables. Hence it should be treated empirically in\nterms of experimental data, with no influence from theoretical concepts such as PDFs or\norder in \u03b1s . Another point of confusion is that the extraction has often been formulated\nin a way influenced by the technical convenience that precisely measured values of \u03c3U U\nare typically represented in terms of an unpolarized structure function called F2 and\nthe ratio R of the cross sections for longitudinal and transverse photons. Unfortunately,\nvarious values R were used to extract the values of F2 , so the world data set for F2\ncontains inconsistencies. This confusion can be avoided by using in equation 3 the\noriginal experimental values of \u03c3U U , reconstructed if necessary using the values of R\nemployed in the original extraction of F2 .\nIf the measurement of A|| is inclusive, i.e., only the scattered lepton is detected\nwhile ignoring the produced hadrons, \u03c3LL is linearly related via a kinematic factor that\nincludes the QED hard scattering cross section to the spin structure function g1 (xB ).\n(There is a small contribution to \u03c3LL from another structure function g2 , which has no\nprobabilistic interpretation, and is measured using a transversely polarized target.) At\nleading order in \u03b1s , g1 for the proton (p) or neutron (n) target has a simple probabilistic\ninterpretation in terms of quark helicity densities for flavour f :\n\u0001\n1X 2\nef \u2206qfp,n (xB ) + \u2206q\u0304fp,n (xB ) .\n(5)\ng1p,n(xB ) =\n2 f\nThe same linear combination relates the first moments \u2206qf of the helicity densities to\nthe moments \u0393p,n\nof g1 :\n1\nZ 1\n\u0001\n1X 2\np,n\nef \u2206qfp,n + \u2206q\u0304fp,n .\n(6)\n\u03931 \u2261\ndxB g1p,n(xB ) =\n2 f\n0\n\nSince the quark charges enter only as squares, inclusive DIS measurements cannot\ndistinguish quarks from antiquarks, and hence can constrain only combinations of\n\u2206u + \u2206\u016b, \u2206d + \u2206d \u0304 and \u2206s + \u2206s\u0304. As mentioned earlier, charge symmetry is a good\napproximation, implying \u2206up + \u2206\u016bp = \u2206dn + \u2206d \u0304n and \u2206un + \u2206\u016bn = \u2206dp + \u2206d \u0304p , and\n\u2206s + \u2206s\u0304 is the same in the neutron and proton. (By convention, when the superscript\nis absent, the proton is implied.) Hence measurements of \u0393p1 and \u0393n1 (inferred from data\non proton and e.g. deuteron targets) provide constraints on two linear combinations of\nthese three unknowns.\nA third such constraint can be derived from measurements of the lifetimes of weakly\ndecaying hyperons, under the assumption of the SU(3) flavour symmetry among quark\ndistributions that would apply in the limit of no mass difference among quark flavours.\nThis symmetry has been found to be valid at the few percent level in a study of the\nrelationship between the lifetimes of hyperons. The additional third constraint allows\nnumber m = \u00b11 are called 'transverse'. Real photons are always transverse. Sometimes the word\n'polarization' is included in this unfortunate nomenclature, even though the distinction has nothing to\ndo with the longitudinal or transverse direction of a spin quantization axis.\n\n\fSpin-polarized high-energy scattering of charged leptons on nucleons\n\n12\n\nall three unknown moments to be extracted, and also their flavour-singlet combination\n \u0304 + (\u2206s + \u2206s\u0304).\n\u2206\u03a3 \u2261 (\u2206u + \u2206\u016b) + (\u2206d + \u2206d)\n(7)\n\nAs described below, it has been inferred from a series of DIS experiments of ever\nincreasing precision that \u2206\u03a3 = 0.2 . . . 0.4 and \u2206s + \u2206s\u0304 is significantly negative.\nThis implies that there must be substantial contributions from quark orbital angular\nmomentum Lq and/or gluon total angular momentum JG , in order to complete the\n'proton spin budget'. The experimental investigation of these contributions is the\nsubject of following sections of this article. Subtle issues about the conceptual basis\nof spin decompositions of a system of interacting constituents are discussed in detail in\nsection 5.1.\n2.2. Axial charge of the nucleon\nThe axial charge gA of the nucleon is obtained from the forward matrix element of\nthe operator \u03c8 \u2020 \u03b3 \u03bc \u03b3 5 \u03c8 in the same way as the familiar (vector) charge gV is obtained\nfrom the forward matrix element of the operator \u03c8 \u2020 \u03b3 \u03bc \u03c8. In terms of quark helicity\neigenstates, the contribution of each quark flavour f to the axial charge of the nucleon\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u2192\n\u2192\ninvolves the same linear combination qf\u21d2 \u2212 qf\u21d0 + q\u0304f\u21d2 \u2212 q\u0304f\u21d0 that also enters the polarized\nstructure function g1 (xB ). As a result, the integral of g1 (xB ) yields the quark-chargesquared-weighted axial charge gA of the nucleon. Since the isovector axial charge of the\nnucleon also describes the \u03b2-decay of the neutron, one can thus relate the integral of\nthe isovector polarized structure function g1 (xB ) to the neutron \u03b2-decay constant. In\nthe scaling limit of infinite Q2 , this relationship between the spin structure functions of\nthe proton and neutron is:\nZ 1\n1 gA\n.\n(8)\ndxB [g1p (xB ) \u2212 g1n (xB )] =\n6 gV\n0\nWhile we presented here only a simple plausibility argument, this famous Bjorken\nSum Rule (BSR) was derived [24] in the Bjorken limit of infinite Q2 even before\nthe advent of QCD, using only Gell-Mann's current algebra relations [25\u201327] together\nwith a reasonable assumption about smooth asymptotic high-energy behaviour of the\nvirtual Compton amplitude. Within the modern context of QCD where the sum rule\ncan be evolved to finite Q2 , it can be tested precisely by practical experiments. If\na violation were discovered, the implications would be profound. This is expressed\neloquently in [28]: \"Occasionally it is worth reminding ourselves what it means to\n'understand' something in QCD. In the absence of fundamental understanding we often\ninvoke 'effective descriptions' based on symmetries and low-energy expansions. While\nthey can be extremely useful, we should not forget that a thorough understanding allows\nus to relate phenomena at very different distance scales to one another. In the case of\nBjorken's sum rule, the operator product expansion, renormalization group invariance\nand isospin conservation combine to relate deep inelastic scattering at high Q2 to the\nneutron's \u03b2-decay axial charge measured at very low energy. Even target mass and\nhigher twist corrections are relatively well understood.\"\n\n\fSpin-polarized high-energy scattering of charged leptons on nucleons\n\n13\n\n2.3. Inclusive DIS experiments\nExperimental information about quark helicity densities in the nucleon has so far come\nonly from DIS of polarized high-energy charged leptons on targets containing polarized\nprotons, or polarized light nuclei containing neutrons. The technologies for polarizing\nbeam and target are challenging, and have been the subject of intense efforts over\nseveral decades. A high beam polarization of 85% was achieved in even the first\nexperiments [29], done at SLAC in the 1970's using a 6\u201323 GeV beam of electrons with\npolarization inherited in the photo-ionization of lithium atoms selected via the SternGerlach method. However, the beam intensity was quite limited, and this approach was\neventually replaced in modern SLAC experiments [30\u201335] using electron beam energies\nup to 50 GeV, polarized at a level of typically 85% in the electron source by photoelectric\nemission from a gallium arsenide surface. Beam intensities increased until they were\nlimited by the heat tolerance of the cryogenic targets. Measurement times are of order\na few weeks.\nMeanwhile, a series of even higher energy experiments at CERN [36\u201343] used 100\u2013\n200 GeV beams of muons naturally polarized to a level of 80% by the weak decay of\nthe precursor \u03c0 or K mesons. These tertiary beams had limited intensities of typically\n4.5 \u00d7 107 per spill of 2.4 s duration, with a spill period of 14.4 s, but the more massive\nmuons suffer less radiative energy loss in the target materials than electrons, allowing\nmuch larger target thicknesses of order meters instead of centimeters. Nevertheless,\nmeasurement times are of order a year.\nMost targets used at SLAC and CERN are cryogenic solids of butanol, ammonia,\nor more recently 6 LiD, in a strong magnetic field, with most protons or deuterons in\nthe target polarized through the process of Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (DNP). For\nDNP to proceed, a suitable material doped with a paramagnetic compound is cooled\nto temperatures less than about 1 K. In the high magnetic field (2\u20136.5 T), the unpaired\nelectron of the dopant is polarized to almost 100%, while the proton or deuteron has a\npolarization of less than 1%. The process of DNP causes most of the electron polarization\nto be transferred to that of the protons by microwave irradiation of the sample. By\nthis means, proton polarizations of more than 95% can be achieved. Typical deuteron\npolarizations are 40\u201355%; recently though, deuteron polarizations of 80% have been\nobtained. However, most of the material encountered by the beam in such solid polarized\ntargets is non-hydrogenous. Hence the asymmetry of interest is strongly diluted by the\nresulting background events, by a factor of up to about 7. This constrains the statistical\nprecision that can be achieved, and requires careful background corrections.\nAs spin structure functions must be determined for both the proton and neutron,\nand targets of free neutrons are still infeasible, measurements are made using targets\ncontaining either deuterons or 3 He. The structures of these light nuclei are such that\nthe spin of the neutron is strongly correlated with that of the nucleus. Protons can\nbe replaced by deuterons in solid-state targets without fundamental changes in the\ntechnology. In contrast, the very different polarized 3 He targets consist of a low pressure\n\n\fSpin-polarized high-energy scattering of charged leptons on nucleons\n\n14\n\ngas polarized via spin exchange with alkaline atoms, the polarization of which is pumped\nby an infrared laser. Such targets were used in a pair of experiments at SLAC. The\ndilution in these targets is contributed by the essentially unpolarized protons in 3 He\nand the thin target windows, and hence is smaller than in the cryogenic solids.\nA completely different experimental approach was followed at the DESY laboratory,\nwhere the 27.5 GeV HERA storage ring contained beams of typically 40 mA of electrons\nor positrons. Such stored high-energy electron beams may become spontaneously\npolarized via a small polarization asymmetry in the emission of synchrotron radiation by\nthe beam particles as they are deflected by the magnetic fields of the ring [44]. (Several\nMW of power was radiated via synchrotron radiation, and was continuously replenished\nby a system of accelerating radio-frequency cavities.) The polarization rise time was\nof order 12 hour, and polarizations as large as 60% were achieved. To avoid disrupting\nthe stored beam, only very thin targets were possible. These were tenuous gases of\nnuclear-polarized atoms of hydrogen or deuterium partially contained in an cylindrical\nopen-ended storage cell coaxial with the beam. The polarized atoms were injected into\nthe cell from an Atomic Beam Source based on Stern-Gerlach polarization filtering and\nradio-frequency transitions between atomic substates in a magnetic field. The atoms\nbounced off the cell walls of order 100 times before escaping from the ends, after which\nthey were differentially pumped away by a large system of turbo-pumps. Polarized\nhydrogen target thicknesses of about 1014 nucleons/cm2 were achieved, and there was\nno target dilution from non-hydrogenous material. Measurement times were of order a\nyear.\n2.4. Quark helicity densities from inclusive DIS data\nThe data from the first polarized DIS measurements at SLAC were used to test simple\ntheoretical expectations of the time, but did not cover a large enough xB range to permit\nthe inference of the first moment of g1 . The first opportunity for this appeared in the\nlate 1980's with the EMC experiment at CERN, which employed 120\u2013200 GeV beams of\nmuons. As already mentioned, the \u0393p1 moment extracted from this data was interpreted\nto imply a surprisingly small net contribution of quark helicities to the proton spin,\nincluding a negative contribution from the strange sea. The resulting excitement led to\na series of experiments of ever-higher precision at SLAC [30, 31, 33\u201335], CERN [36\u201340],\nand DESY [45\u201347]. Figure 4 shows published data for the spin structure functions g1 (xB )\nof the proton and deuteron, while figure 5 shows the results for the neutron inferred from\nthe data in figure 4, or from measurements with a 3 He target.

The figure is taken from [47].\n\n\fSpin-polarized high-energy scattering of charged leptons on nucleons\n\n17\n\ninference of \u03931 requires some estimate of the contributions to the moments from the\nunmeasured regions at the extremes of this range. These estimates are based on some\nassumption or ansatz motivated by reasonable expectations. Another problem is that\nthese data were all produced by fixed-target experiments, resulting in a strong kinematic\ncorrelation between xB and the hard scale Q2 , so that each data point corresponds to a\ndifferent value of Q2 , as shown in the bottom panels of figures 4 and 5. This implies that\nit is impossible to directly calculate the first moment of g1 (xB ) from experimental data.\nHence, some assumption or ansatz is typically employed to approximately 'evolve' the\ndata from that experiment to a common value of Q2 . (The resulting model uncertainty\nhas not always been estimated and included with the final result.) Applying these\napproaches to the results of individual experiments has resulted in agreement with the\nBSR within the experimental uncertainty, which typically amounts to about 9% of the\nSum [47].\nImportant information about the polarized parton distributions can be extracted\nfrom the measured structure functions via (5). The most efficient use of the data\nfrom the various experiments done at different beam energies and kinematic conditions\nis achieved by incorporating all available data in a global fit based on the evolution\npredicted by QCD in Next-to-Leading Order (NLO) in \u03b1s . This approach has the\nimportant advantage that it also provides information about the polarization of the\ngluons contained in the nucleon. In the order \u03b1s version of the DGLAP evolution\nequations, gluons couple to quarks via 'splitting': g \u2192 q q\u0304. Hence the evolution of the g1\nstructure functions with Q2 contains information on the helicity density of the gluons.\nHowever, in NLO some choice must be made between various 'factorization schemes'\nfor sharing a dependence on Q2 between the parton distributions and the coefficient\nfunctions relating them to the structure functions. This introduces an arbitrary scheme\ndependence to the results of the fit, although results obtained in any one scheme can\nbe transformed into any other scheme. The results presented here were obtained in the\nso-called MS scheme [52].\nThe fitted parameters appear in some functional form for the x dependence of each\nof several parton helicity densities, including the gluon helicity density \u2206G(x), at some\narbitrarily chosen 'starting' value Q20 . (While this functional form is chosen with the\nbenefit of some physical insight, the choice introduces some model dependence into the\nresults from the fit.) At each step in the parameter search, the g1 (xB ) function defined\nby the current values of the parameters is evolved using the DGLAP equations to the Q2\nvalue of each experimental data point, and the discrepancy is taken as a \u03c72 contribution.\nSince the inclusive cross section is sensitive to only the square of the quark\ncharges and not to their signs, inclusive measurements cannot distinguish quarks from\nantiquarks. Because of this as well as the limited precision and Q2 range of the existing\ndata, a useful fit is impossible without further assumptions. The global fits done up to\nnow include the previously mentioned constraint based on hyperon beta decay lifetimes\ntogether with the assumption of SU(3) flavour symmetry, and sometimes also impose\nthe BSR.

Helicity densities of the strange sea \u2206s(x) + \u2206s\u0304(x) (left) and of the gluons\n(right), at Q2 = 2.5 GeV2 , for three different choices for the shape of the gluon densities,\nall with a similar quality of fit to the g1 data. The figure is taken from [53].\n\ninformation, or may be also fitted as a parameter, in which case it is found to be\nconsistent with previous knowledge. Some fits also impose an (arbitrary) symmetry\ncondition among the sea quarks: \u2206\u016b = \u2206d \u0304 = \u2206s = \u2206s\u0304. This is only a device for\ndefining valence quark densities \u2206qfv \u2261 \u2206qf \u2212 \u2206q\u0304f , and does not affect the fitted\nstrange sea quark and gluon densities.\nMany groups have presented results of NLO global fits of all available g1 data\navailable at that time. Relatively recent examples are reported in [34, 53\u201357]. Figure 6\nshows the results of one recent fit [53] that accounts for contributions to g1 that scale as\n1/Q2 , which are significant for the data measured at Q2 less than a few GeV2 . As the\nphotoabsorption cross section is independent of the sign of the quark charge, \u2206\u016b and\n\u2206d \u0304 are unconstrained by inclusive data. Hence for this fit the convention was adopted\nof a flavour symmetric sea:\n\u2206usea = \u2206\u016b = \u2206dsea = \u2206d \u0304 = \u2206s = \u2206s\u0304 .\n\n(9)\n\nIt is clearly determined that up quarks have a substantial positive polarization over\nthe entire measured x range, while down quarks have a somewhat smaller and negative\npolarization. The polarization of the strange quark sea is found to be small but clearly\nnegative. The gluon helicity distribution \u2206G(x) is still poorly constrained, even though\nmany new precise data have recently been added to the global set. In fact there are\ntwo alternative solutions (local minima in \u03c72 ) of equal quality with opposite signs of\nthe gluon density, and yet another of similar quality using a bipolar shape for the x\ndependence. The reason for the large uncertainty is that the g1 data set is still far less\nextensive and precise than the unpolarized set, and covers a much more limited range\nin Q2 (see section 2.8). The first moments of the helicity densities determined from\nthe fit are shown in table 1. (These moments have some sensitivity to the assumed\nfunctional form of the densities, especially in the unmeasured small-x region.) The\nflavour-singlet moment \u2206\u03a3 is found to be in the range 0.2 to 0.25, implying that the\n\n\fSpin-polarized high-energy scattering of charged leptons on nucleons\n\n19\n\nTable 1.

The gluon moment \u2206G is\nstill poorly determined, but it appears that large values are disfavoured.\nThis collection of increasingly precise data from all of the experiments also offers\nthe opportunity to more severely test the BSR. It is difficult to efficiently employ all of\nthe data while computing the Sum directly from measured values of g1p and g1n (or g1d )\nusing (8), because kinematic interpolation and evolution to a common value of Q2 is\nneeded. This in turn requires a paramerization of the xB dependence at some 'starting'\nvalue of Q2 , just as in the fits described above. In fact, those fits can be used to test\nthe BSR, simply by omitting the usual BSR constraint from the fit, and computing the\nSum from the resulting \u2206q(x) distributions produced by the fit (while accounting for\nuncertainty correlations). The relevant combination providing the structure function\ndifference is the 'flavour non-singlet' distribution:\nX\n\u2206qN S (x) \u2261\n(e2f /he2 i \u2212 1) (\u2206qf (x) + \u2206q\u0304f (x)) .\n(10)\nf\n\nThe removal of the BSR constraint from the fit may result in large uncertainties\nfor individual densities, but their uncertainty correlations should result in a smaller\nuncertainty for \u2206qN S . This approach might at first seem bizarre, because the sum rule\nis believed to be much more reliable than the assumption of SU(3) flavour symmetry used\nin the fits! However, it can be expected that \u2206qN S will be insensitive to the constraint\nfrom hyperon decay data if the proton and deuteron data have comparable precision\nand kinematic coverage, which is the case. (This can easily be verified by varying this\ninput to the fit to study the sensitivity.) Hence for this purpose, the fitting process\nprovides mainly the evolution of the data points to a common value of Q2 , as well as\nthe model used to extrapolate to x = 0, 1. This approach leads to good agreement with\n\n\fSpin-polarized high-energy scattering of charged leptons on nucleons\n\n20\n\nthe BSR within the total uncertainty from the fit, which amounted to about 10% of the\nsum, using the data available in 1998 [58]. Much more precise data are available today.\nThere are several technical issues arising in the QCD fits that can be kept in mind\nwhen considering their results. First, typically the values taken from experiment are\nthose for g1 /F1 , even though the unpolarized structure function F1 has no relevance,\nand the systematic uncertainties for g1 /F1 include a significant contribution from the\npoorly known ratio R = \u03c3L /\u03c3T of cross sections for longitudinal and transverse photons,\nwhich has no effect on g1 itself. The reason given for this choice is the fact that\nexperimental groups may have extracted g1 from the measured asymmetries effectively\nusing values for the unpolarized cross section that were calculated using various values\nof R. However, as it is the ratio g1 /F1 that is sensitive to R and not g1 , it appears\nthat this choice aggravates the problem. (Fortunately, the effects of this may be\nsmall.) Secondly, it can be difficult to obtain reliable results from multidimensional\nfits of data with limited statistical accuracy. Evidence for such difficulty here is the\nirregular shape of the dependence of \u03c72 on some parameters that are reported. Up\nto three minima have recently been seen with similar values of \u03c72 [53]. A common\nmethod of testing the stability and accuracy of algorithms for extracting results from\nexperimental data is to analyze Monte Carlo pseudo-data. The situation here could\nbe clarified if g1 pseudo-data were generated from a chosen set of polarized parton\ndistributions, which could be compared to the results of the fit. Thirdly, two groups\nreport statistical uncertainties that are inflated by approximately the square root of the\nnumber of fitted parameters (assuming that the \u03c72 surface is quadratic in a substantial\nregion near the minimum), so that their uncertainties cannot be directly compared\nto those of other groups. These inflated uncertainties do not correspond to what\nis understood by most of the community as a statistical uncertainty. (One way of\ndefining this conventional uncertainty is the standard deviation of the distribution of the\nresults that would be derived from similarly fitting a large number of Monte Carlo data\nsets resembling the global experimental data set, but with each data point fluctuating\nindependently according to its experimental statistical uncertainty.) Fourthly, some\ngroups account for the (substantial) experimental normalization uncertainty that is\ncommon to an entire data set from one experiment (arising from e.g. uncertainty in\npolarization of beam or target) by adding that common component of the systematic\nuncertainty in quadrature to the statistical uncertainty of each data point. This\nincorrectly deprecates the information available in those data. It is straight-forward\nto more appropriately account for the normalization uncertainty by means of a \u03c72\npenalty term driven by a renormalization factor for that data set. Fifthly, few groups\n(see e.g. [55, 58]) estimate 'theoretical' uncertainties for their results, arising from e.g.\nthe somewhat arbitrary choice of functional forms to parameterize the helicity densities,\nand the dependence of the results on factorization and renormalization scales, indicating\nincomplete convergence of the perturbative expansion.\nWe have seen that the global data set for the spin structure function g1 on the proton\nand neutron target has firmly established that quark helicities account for only a fraction\n\n\fSpin-polarized high-energy scattering of charged leptons on nucleons\n\n21\n\nof the proton spin, leaving substantial contributions to be made by gluons and quark\norbital angular momenta. The large uncertainty in the moment \u2206G from global fits to\ng1 data has motivated several major efforts to directly measure \u2206G(x) using processes\nin which gluons enter in leading order, as described in section 2.8. Furthermore,\ninformation about quark orbital angular momentum is beginning to emerge from both\ncalculations on the lattice and measurements of cross section differences or asymmetries\nfor the deeply virtual Compton scattering process, as described in sections 4 and 5.2.\n2.5. Helicity densities of sea quarks from semi-inclusive DIS data\nAs mentioned above, quarks and antiquarks of the same flavour cannot be distinguished\nin inclusive DIS measurements, since the contributions of the various quark flavours to\nthe cross sections scale as the square of the quark charges and hence are independent\nof the sign. Furthermore, the strange sea can be separated only in terms of first xmoments, because of the necessary constraint from hyperon beta decay data. In order\nto obtain information about the x dependence of the helicity densities of the various\nflavours, particularly of sea quarks, it is necessary to use additional types of experimental\ninformation. In semi-inclusive scattering (see figure 1), an energetic hadron is detected\nin coincidence with the scattered lepton. If suitable kinematic criteria are applied in\nthe selection of the hadrons, they are likely to be members of the 'jet' of hadrons\nproduced in the fragmentation of the struck quark, the non-perturbative process in\nwhich the energy of the quark is shared among hadrons created through the excitation\nof quark-antiquark pairs from the vacuum. For our purposes here, a key point is that\nthe identities of the hadrons are statistically correlated with the flavour of the struck\nquark. For example, a \u03c0 + meson having valence composition ud\u0304 is more likely to appear\nin the fragmentation of a u or d \u0304 struck quark, and kaons are more likely to arise from\nstrange quark fragmentation. However, these probabilities are also modulated by the\nsquare of the charges of the various flavours and their (known) spin-averaged quark\ndensities. Hence the exploitation of this method is limited to some degree by the 'uquark dominance' arising from both of these effects. For example, \u03c0 \u2212 = d\u016b mesons\nand even K \u2212 = \u016bs mesons, which provide good sensitivity to sea quarks, arise more\noften from fragmentation of u quarks. Hence a quark flavour decomposition based on\ndata for various identified hadrons requires the solution of a strongly coupled system of\nrelationships, which in turn requires primary data of high precision.\nGiven an adequate understanding of the fragmentation process, a complete flavour\ndecomposition of the quark and antiquark helicity distributions can be extracted from\nsufficiently precise measurements on both proton and 'neutron' targets of double-spin\nasymmetries in the cross sections for leptoproduction of various types of hadrons.\nThe extraction requires knowledge of the probabilities for the various types h of\nhadrons to appear in the fragmentation of a struck quark of a given flavour f . These\nprobabilities are embodied in the (familiar unpolarized) fragmentation functions Dfh (z),\nwhere z \u2261 Eh /\u03bd and \u03bd and Eh are the energies in the target rest frame of the absorbed\n\n\fSpin-polarized high-energy scattering of charged leptons on nucleons\n\n22\n\nvirtual photon (and hence of the struck quark) and of the detected hadron. While\nthese fragmentation functions have typically been extracted [59, 60] from mostly high\nenergy e+ e\u2212 collider data, a recent extraction [61] includes preliminary semi-inclusive\nDIS multiplicities of identified hadrons [62].\nFor leptoproduction of a hadron h, the semi-inclusive cross section difference that\nis analogous to the inclusive case of (2) can be factorized in leading order in \u03b1s as\n99K\n99K\nd[\u03c3h\u21d2 (xB , z) \u2212 \u03c3h\u21d0 (xB , z)] X 2\n\u221d\nef \u2206qf (xB )Dfh (z) .\n(11)\ndxB dz\nf\n\nIf, for example, there are available experimental measurements of these cross section\ndifferences for production of \u03c0 + , \u03c0 \u2212 , K + and K \u2212 mesons on both proton and 'neutron'\ntargets, this system of eight over-constrained equations can in principle be solved for\nthe helicity densities of up to six light quark flavours. As mentioned above, in practice\nu-quark dominance limits the sensitivity to some sea quark flavours.\nAs in the case of inclusive measurements, absolute cross section differences are\ndifficult to measure, especially with polarized targets. Hence cross section asymmetries\nare extracted from the data. Figure 7 shows all of the measured semi-inclusive doublespin asymmetries on both hydrogen and deuterium targets. It includes data from SMC\nfor unidentified hadrons [43], from Hermes for production of identified \u03c0 + , \u03c0 \u2212 , K + and\nK \u2212 mesons [63], and from Compass for unidentified hadrons [64]. Each collaboration\nextracted helicity densities in leading order in \u03b1s . In the case of Hermes, all three sea\nquark flavours could be distinguished, while fragmentation functions were effectively\nfitted to hadron multiplicities measured by the same experiment. It was found that\nthe helicity densities of all three sea quark flavours are consistent with zero within the\nmeasured x range. Further analysis of all these data were later done in NLO, including\ndata from other processes. This is described in the next section.\n2.6. Helicity densities from a global analysis in NLO\n\nThe most complete extraction of helicity densities from all relevant published data\nappears in [65]. It is a global NLO QCD analysis like that described in section 2.4 for\ninclusive DIS data, but with the crucial inclusion of semi-inclusive DIS data to provide\nsensitivity to individual sea quark flavours, and for the first time RHIC p\u21d2 + p\u21d2 data\nfor inclusive production of neutral pions and jets, providing much stronger constraints\non the gluon helicity. Another new feature of the fit is the use of the above-mentioned\nset of fragmentation functions [61] based on not only e+ e\u2212 data but also preliminary\nsemi-inclusive DIS multiplicities of identified hadrons.\nThe extensive data set allows some freedom in the application of the constraint\nof neutron [hyperon] beta decay data through the assumption of SU(2) [SU(3)] flavour\nsymmetry. Penalty terms were added to \u03c72 to limit violations of SU(2) and SU(3)\nsymmetries, but their values at the solution are negligible compared to unity, suggesting\nthat, at least in terms of first moments, the data are fully compatible with these\nsymmetries.

The dotted and longdashed curves represent the previously known unpolarized densities, which act as\npositivity limits to the helicity density limits through the requirement that all cross\nsections be non-negative. The dashed (dot-dashed) curves represent the results of the\nprevious fits of [56] ( [54]). The figure is taken from [65].\n\nFigure 8 shows the resulting parton helicity densities with uncertainty bands, while\ntable 2 shows their (truncated) first moments. The densities \u2206u + \u2206\u016b and \u2206d + \u2206d \u0304\nare not shown because they were already well constrained by the inclusive data. The\nsemi-inclusive data constrain the sea densities, especially \u2206s, where a solution to a longstanding mystery appears. Leading-order analysis of semi-inclusive data has indicated\nthat the strange helicity density is small or even positive at large x, whereas all analyses\nof only inclusive data imposing SU(3) symmetry clearly favour negative values of the\nfirst moment of \u2206s + \u2206s\u0304. These findings are now reconciled by a bipolar shape of \u2206s\u0304\nthat is negative at small x and positive at large x. However, figure 8 shows that the first\nmoment \u2206s\u0304 is negative only because of the substantial contribution from the region\nx < 0.01, and table 2 shows that even x < 0.001 contributes strongly. It may seem\nmysterious that the fit forces \u2206s\u0304 to be negative in a region of small x devoid of data,\nwhile the penalty term for SU(3) violation is so small at the solution point.

Table 2 shows that the first moment \u2206G of the possibly bipolar\ndistribution is consistent with zero, still with rather large uncertainties.\nA quantity of particular interest that is accessible to semi-inclusive DIS data is the\n \u0304\nflavour asymmetry \u2206\u016b(x) \u2212 \u2206d(x).\nNaively, one might expect that since u and d quarks\nhave similarly small masses and they both are produced by gluon 'splitting' (g \u2192 q q\u0304),\nboth their densities and polarizations would be similar. However, the difference in\n \u0304\ntheir unpolarized densities \u016b(x) \u2212 d(x)\nis experimentally well established [68], and is\nexplained by various non-perturbative models that also predict an asymmetry in the\nhelicity densities. Such a delicate imbalance in nucleon structure provides an excellent\ntest of such models. The flavour asymmetry \u2206\u016b \u2212 \u2206d \u0304 in the first moments can be\ncompared to the predictions of two representative models. One is the chiral quark\nsoliton model (\u03c7QSM) [69], which is an effective theory where baryons appear as soliton\nsolutions of the chiral Lagrangian, and the other is a 'meson cloud' model [70] that\nconsiders quantum fluctuations of the spin- 21 nucleon into a virtual pion with spin 1\nplus a \u2206 hadron with spin 23 . The value \u2206\u016b \u2212 \u2206d \u0304 = 0.15+0.11\n\u22120.10 from the fit is consistent\nwith the predictions of both models, but with a preference for the \u03c7QSM.\n2.7. Comparison of first moments of helicity densities\nTwo previous sections discussed three significantly different but not independent sources\nof information about first moments of helicity distributions: the direct interpretation\nof the first moment of the spin structure function g1d of the deuteron, NLO QCD fits\n\n\fSpin-polarized high-energy scattering of charged leptons on nucleons\n\n26\n\nof parameterized helicity densities to all g1 data (see section 2.4), and global fits of\nhelicity densities to all available relevant data, including double-spin asymmetries for\nboth semi-inclusive DIS and inclusive production of neutral pions and jets in p\u21d2 + p\u21d2\n(section 2.6). The first moments from these analyses are compared in table 3 on page 104.\nThe comparison of results from the NLO QCD fits should be undertaken with caution,\nas the analyses differ in several respects. The LSS fit uses only inclusive DIS data,\nincluding the Compass data on the deuteron, which leads to two equally probable\nsolutions. They are merged into a range of values given in the table rather than central\nvalues with standard deviations. The AAC fit does not yet include the Compass data,\nbut includes some double-spin asymmetries for inclusive production of neutral pions in\np\u21d2 + p\u21d2 . Finally the DSSV fit includes all inclusive and semi-inclusive DIS data, as\nwell as double-spin asymmetries for both semi-inclusive DIS and inclusive production of\nneutral pions and jets in p\u21d2 + p\u21d2 . Another important difference between the analyses\nis the treatment of experimental statistical uncertainties, indicated in the first column.\nThe LSS uncertainties are based on the standard treatment specified by the PDG [71],\nwhile the AAC group adopts a different treatment that increases their uncertainties.\nThe DSSV group provides the results from two treatments. Finally, the common\nelements of the data sets used for the various results imply that the uncertainties are\ncorrelated, so that they should in principle be in better agreement than indicated by\ntheir uncertainties.\nThe values for \u2206\u03a3 are all consistent, with the possible exception that the DSSV\nresult for the 'standard' treatment of statistical uncertainties (\u2206\u03c72 = 1) appears to\nbe somewhat smaller. However it is important to bear in mind that the contribution\n\u22120.124 to that result from the unmeasured region x < 0.001 is much larger than this\n'discrepancy'.\nHaving accounted for the factor of two relating the DSSV value for \u2206s\u0304 (assuming\n\u2206s = \u2206s\u0304) to the values for \u2206s + \u2206s\u0304 from the other two fits, all of the results again are\nconsistent, again with the possible exception that the DSSV result for \u2206\u03c72 = 1 appears\nto be somewhat more negative. However, essentially all of this value is contributed by\nthe unmeasured region x < 0.001. The uncertainty of the DSSV result is much larger\nthan that of AAC, in spite of the additional data used in the DSSV fit, presumably\nbecause of the relaxation of SU(3) flavour symmetry.\nFinally, all the results for \u2206G are consistent with each other and with zero. The\nadditional RHIC data included in the DSSV fit resolves the ambiguity arising in the\nLSS fit, and much improves the precision. Here the contribution to that result from the\nunmeasured region is about \u22120.07. Other (leading order) experimental constraints on\n\u2206G are discussed in the next subsection.\n2.8. Gluon helicity distribution\nThe nucleon spin can be decomposed into contributions of quarks and gluons, as will\nbe explained in section 5.1.

The intrinsic gluon\ncontribution \u2206G is accessible to experiment. Until recently the only existing knowledge\nabout the gluon helicity distribution \u2206G(x) was derived as its first moment \u2206G \u2261\nR1\ndx \u2206G(x), from NLO pQCD fits to the spin-dependent structure function g1 (x, Q2 )\n0\nmeasured in double-spin lepton-nucleon scattering experiments (see section 2.3).\nHowever, this method is subject to large uncertainties, as g1 (x, Q2 ) is only weakly\nsensitive to \u2206G(x) via the Q2 evolution of parton distribution functions. Very recently,\nbetter precision was achieved in a global analysis of DIS and pp data, as explained in\nsection 2.6.\nMore experimental data are now emerging from the study of the subprocess in\nwhich gluons appear in leading order in double-spin lepton-nucleon scattering: PhotonGluon Fusion (PGF), see figure 9(b). Here, the gluon emits a q q\u0304 pair in which each\nquark inherits the helicity of the gluon. As explained in section 1, the (anti-)quark\ncan absorb the photon only if they have the same helicity. Given positive (negative)\nvalues of \u2206G(x), the PGF process has a negative (positive) asymmetry, while the major\nbackground processes DIS (figure 9(a)) and QCD Compton (figure 9(c)) have always a\npositive asymmetry.\nThe PGF process produces a q q\u0304 pair resulting in 2 jets of hadrons. At fixed-target\nenergies, one has to use a leading hadron to represent a jet, plus possibly another\nhadron separated by large transverse momentum kT to represent the other jet. In order\nto suppress background processes, final states are selected which contain either large\ntransverse momenta or charm. These signatures are also exploited to access \u2206G(x) in\ndouble-spin proton-proton scattering in the experiments Star and Phenix at Rhic. A\ncleaner channel in these experiments will be single direct photon production.\n(x) is extracted in a leading-order analysis from the\nThe gluon polarization \u2206G\nG\nmeasured double-spin asymmetry A|| in the hadron production cross section.

Leading-order results on \u2206G\nG (x), published or preliminary, from\nCompass [76\u201378], Hermes [75, 79], and SMC [80]. The sequence of references\ncorresponds to the order of measurements shown in the legend, where also the\nanalysed final state is indicated. Outer error bars, if shown, represent statistical and\nsystematic uncertainties combined in quadrature. Inner error bars represent statistical\nuncertainties only. Additionally, two equivalently good QCD NLO fits of the structure\nfunction g1d are shown [72], obtained with the constraints \u2206G < 0 and \u2206G > 0,\nrespectively. The figure is taken from [76], updated with [78].\n\nat very low Q2 [75] and from Compass on high-transverse-momentum hadron-pair\nproduction on the deuteron at Q2 < 1 GeV2 [77] as well as at Q2 > 1 GeV2 [78].\nFor the Hermes result, very detailed studies were performed to estimate systematic\nuncertainties associated with Monte Carlo models of the background processes. The\nmajor contribution here stems from the uncertainties in the fractional contribution from\nsoft processes, which are poorly known. Among the Compass results on high-pt hadron\npairs, the most recent also includes a study of systematic uncertainties associated with\nthe Monte Carlo model.\n(x) at mediumFrom the three high-pt hadron results, it can be concluded that \u2206G\nG\nx (0.06...0.3) is about 0.1 with a total uncertainty of the same magnitude. This\nleading-order result is in fair agreement with results of NLO fits of g1 from [72] shown\n\n\f30\n\nSpin-polarized high-energy scattering of charged leptons on nucleons\n\nas curves in figure 11. The value of the unpolarized gluon distribution from the\nCTEQ6 set of PDFs [81] is G(x)|x=0.1 \u2248 10, so that for the gluon helicity distribution\n\u2206G(x)|x=0.1 \u2248 1 \u00b1 1 is obtained. Expressed as x * \u2206G(x), the LO result from high-pt\nhadrons is 0.1 \u00b1 0.1, in agreement with the less model-dependent result from the NLO\nQCD fits of [65] discussed in the previous section (see bottom right panel of figure 8).\nWe note that any comparison of next-to-leading-order to leading-order results has to be\ndone with caution since k factors, defined as their ratio, are known to be large. In the\nkinematic region considered here, k factors were found [82] of up to 5 for cross sections\nand up to 2 for asymmetries that are used to extract information on the polarized gluon\ndistribution.\nIf and when it becomes possible to experimentally constrain the full first moment\n\u2206G with sufficient accuracy, it will be possible to determine the total orbital angular\nmomentum L of partons according to (12).\n3. The transverse spin structure of the nucleon\n3.1. Transverse spin in deep-inelastic scattering\nThe quark transversity distribution \u03b4qf (x) was defined in section 1 as the difference\nbetween number densities of quarks with transverse polarization in the same and\nopposite direction as that of the nucleon spin, in a nucleon that is polarized transverse\nto its 'infinite' momentum. It may at first appear mysterious that it is necessary to\ndistinguish between \u03b4qf (x) and the helicity distribution \u2206qf (x), since there would be\nno need to distinguish between them in a nonrelativistic system.\nAll twist-2 parton distributions are defined as light-cone Fourier transforms of\nproducts of quark fields \u03c8f (or gluon fields). The only difference between qf (x), \u2206qf (x),\nand \u03b4qf (x) are the Dirac matrices that appear between \u03c8f\u2020 and \u03c8f . For \u2206qf the\nDirac matrices are (in Dirac representation, where the lower components vanish in the\nnonrelativistic limit)\n!\n!\n!\n!\n1\n0\n0\n\u03c3\n0\n1\n\u03c3\n0\ni\ni\n\u03b3 0\u03b3 i\u03b3 5 =\n=\n,\n(13)\n0 \u22121\n\u2212\u03c3i 0\n1 0\n0 \u03c3i\nwhile for \u03b4qf they read\ni\u03b3 0 \u03c3 0i \u03b3 5 = \u03b3 i \u03b3 5 =\n\n0 \u03c3i\n\u2212\u03c3i 0\n\n!\n\n0 1\n1 0\n\n!\n\n=\n\n\u03c3i 0\n0 \u2212\u03c3i\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(14)\n\nSo the only difference between \u2206qf and \u03b4qf is the minus sign in front of the lower\ncomponents. In the nonrelativistic limit, the lower components vanish like p/m, so the\ndifference between \u2206qf and \u03b4qf vanishes like v 2 /c2 .\nTransversity loses its probabilistic interpretation as a difference in number density\ndistributions when expanded in a helicity basis. Every observable in quantum mechanics\nhas a probabilistic interpretation as the sum of eigenvalues of the observable weighted by\n\n\fSpin-polarized high-energy scattering of charged leptons on nucleons\n\n31\n\nthe probability to be in each eigenstate.\u2020 However, if basis functions are used in which\nthe observable is not diagonal, the expectation value of the observable becomes a sum\nover products of amplitudes and the probabilistic interpretation is 'lost', or at least not\napparent. In the present context this elementary principle appears most clearly using\nPauli matrices and identifying eigenstates of \u03c3z or \u03c3x with helicity eigenstates | \u2194i\nor transversity eigenstates | li = \u221a12 (| \u2192i + ei\u03c6 | \u2190i), respectively, where \u03c6 specifies\nthe orientation of the transverse polarization direction. Obviously \u03c3x is diagonal when\nexpressed in terms of its own eigenvectors, but loses this property when expressed in\nterms of the eigenvectors of \u03c3z :\n\u03c3x = |\u2191ih\u2191| \u2212 |\u2193ih\u2193| = |\u2190ih\u2192| + |\u2192i h\u2190| .\n\n(15)\n\nTherefore the expectation value of the 'transversity operator' \u03c3x in some state \u03c8 becomes\na sum of products of amplitudes in the helicity basis:\nh\u03c8|\u03c3x |\u03c8i = |h\u03c8| \u2191i|2 \u2212 |h\u03c8| \u2193i|2 = h\u03c8| \u2190ih\u03c8| \u2192i\u2217 + h\u03c8| \u2192ih\u03c8| \u2190i\u2217 . (16)\nThe right hand side of (16) is not a sum over absolute squares and hence the probabilistic\ninterpretation for h\u03c8|\u03c3x |\u03c8i is no longer apparent.\nDespite the loss of a direct probabilistic interpretation, there are (at least) two\nreasons for discussing transversity in a helicity basis. First, that basis has already been\nused to study the more familiar longitudinal spin polarization, and secondly only helicity\nand not transversity is conserved in hard processes. The second statement is based on\nthe observation that for negligible quark masses, both the QCD and QED Lagrangians\nare invariant under a 'chiral' transformation of the quark spinors:\n5\n\n\u03c8f (x) \u2212\u2192 ei\u03b5\u03b3 \u03c8f (x).\n\n(17)\n\nAs a consequence of this 'chiral symmetry', the chirality of a massless quark (the\neigenvalue of \u03b3 5 ) is conserved. It turns out that for a massless quark its chirality\nagrees with its helicity, but for an antiquark with the opposite sign.\u2021 Chiral symmetry\nthus implies the conservation of the helicity of a massless quark in hard scattering\nprocesses. However, even though helicity is conserved, transversity is not, as the\nscattering amplitudes for the two helicity states may differ in their phase. An analogue\nfrom optics is the propagation of light through an optically active medium where the\nrefraction indices for the two circular polarization states are different. While the circular\npolarization does not change as the beam propagates through this medium, the linear\npolarization, which is related to the longitudinal polarization through a simple linear\ncombination, precesses around the beam axis since the waves describing the two circular\npolarization states acquire different phases in such a medium.\nAn important distinction must be made between transversity and transverse spin.\nTransverse spin is the expectation value of the operator \u03c8 \u2020 \u03b3 \u22a5 \u03b35 \u03c8 and is chiral-even,\n\u2020 This is one of the postulates of quantum mechanics.\n\u2021 This minus sign for antiquarks also illustrates that, even for massless quarks, chirality and helicity\nare not the same in the sense of being described by the same operator, which is one reason why it is\nnecessary to introduce the concept of chirality in addition to helicity. Another is that the helicity of a\nmassive particle is frame dependent, whereas chirality is always Lorentz-invariant.\n\n\f32\n\nSpin-polarized high-energy scattering of charged leptons on nucleons\n\nwhereas chiral-odd transversity is the expectation value of the operator \u03c8 \u2020 \u03c3 \u03bc\u03bd \u03b35 \u03c8, which\nhas matrix elements between states of opposite quark helicity in the proton rest frame.\nTransverse spin does not have a partonic interpretation in the light-cone framework\nand\npis associated with the (twist-3) spin structure function g2 , whose effects vanish like\n1/ Q2 in the Bjorken limit, whereas transversity does not vanish in this limit. For a\ndetailed discussion of these subtle issues see [83].\nSince hard electromagnetic (or weak) processes conserve the helicity of the quark,\ninclusive DIS experiments cannot be used to measure the transversity of the quarks.\nIn order to see why, we first use the optical theorem in a transversity basis and then\nexpress transversity eigenstates in terms of helicity eigenstates. The difference between\nthe contribution to the cross section from quarks with the same and with opposite\ntransverse polarization as the nucleon would be proportional to the imaginary part of a\nforward scattering amplitude involving quark helicity flip (see figure 12). However, since\n\n2\n\u2191\n\u21d1\n\n2\n\u2212\n\n\u2193\n\u21d1\n\n\u2192\n\n\u221d Im\n\u21d1\n\n\u2190\n\n=0\n\u21d1\n\nFigure 12. When expressed in terms of quark helicity states, the dependence of the\nDIS cross section on the transversity of the quarks is proportional to the imaginary\npart of the quark helicity-flip forward Compton amplitude which vanishes at large Q2 .\n\nabsorption of a hard vector boson (e.g. photon) cannot flip the helicity of a massless\nquark, this forward scattering amplitude must be zero and therefore inclusive DIS cannot\nbe sensitive to the transverse spin of the quarks. Since this argument does not involve\nthe polarization of the photon in DIS, this result also illustrates why a transversely\npolarized charged lepton beam does not help to determine the transverse polarization\nof the quarks in inclusive DIS. In semi-inclusive DIS, the meson production vertex can\nflip quark helicity, which is why the latter process can be sensitive to transverse quark\npolarization.\nIt is instructive to compare DIS mediated by vector boson exchange, where quark\nhelicity is conserved, with a Gedanken DIS experiment involving scalar bosons, where\nquark helicity flips at the hard quark-scalar vertex. If only scalar bosons are exchanged,\nthen the quark helicity flips at both vertices in the forward Compton amplitude\nanalogous to figure 12 and such a process would not be sensitive to quark transversity\neither. Only the interference term between vector and scalar boson exchange provides\nthe single helicity flip that is needed to make this amplitude non-vanishing, i.e. the\ninterference between photon exchange and the exchange of a hypothetical scalar boson\n(such as the Higgs boson) would in principle be suitable for accessing transversity\nexperimentally using inclusive DIS [84].\n\n\fSpin-polarized high-energy scattering of charged leptons on nucleons\n\n33\n\n3.2. Tensor Charge of the Nucleon\nThe tensor charge is obtained from the forward matrix element of the operator\n\u03c8f\u2020 \u03c3 \u03bc\u03bd \u03c8f , analogously to the vector and axial vector charge (see section 2.2). In terms\nof quark transversity\neigenstates, the tensor charge involves the linear combination\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u2191\u21d1\n\u2193\u21d1\n\u2191\u21d1\n\u2193\u21d1\nqf \u2212 qf \u2212 q\u0304f \u2212 q\u0304f , i.e. the transversity of the quarks minus the transversity of\nthe antiquarks. The fact that the tensor charge contains the difference between quark\nand antiquark transversity is convenient as the contributions from short-lived virtual\nq q\u0304 pairs cancel, and it can be identified with the transversity of valence quarks only.\nMoreover, the tensor charge can be computed in lattice gauge theory, and with better\nprecision than the axial charge (see section 4.4).\nIn a helicity basis, transversity involves both a quark and a nucleon helicity flip,\ni.e. it involves the overlap between a nucleon 'state' that had positive helicity and from\nwhich a quark with positive helicity has been removed and another nucleon 'state' that\nhad negative helicity and from which a quark with negative helicity has been removed.\nThe Cauchy-Schwarz inequality tells us that this 'scalar product' is less than the norms\nof the states involved. Since the latter represent the probability to find a quark with\nthe same helicity as the nucleon spin, one thus finds the Soffer inequality [85]\n\u2192\n\n2|\u03b4qf (x)| \u2264 2qf\u21d2 (x) = qf (x) + \u2206qf (x),\n\n(18)\n\nwhich holds independently for each quark and antiquark flavor. It provides useful\nconstraints on parameterizations of transversity.\nAttempts have been made to develop a 'transversity sum rule' [86, 87] that is\nanalogous to the 'Ji decomposition' of the nucleon spin (39) but involves the net\ntransversity of quarks (plus antiquarks). However, one problem with any transversity\nsum rule is that quarks and anti-quarks contribute with opposite signs to the tensor\ncharge (first moment of transversity), while they contribute to either longitudinal or\ntransverse nucleon spin with the same sign. Therefore, transversity cannot contribute\nto such a sum rule in terms of the tensor charge, but rather in terms of the tensor\ncharge for the quarks plus the anti-quarks - a combination that cannot be represented\nin terms of a local operator. Therefore lattice calculations will be unable to calculate the\ntransversity contribution to a transversity sum rule. Furthermore, in the transversity\nsum rule in [86, 87], neither an operator definition nor an experimental procedure for\ndetermining the orbital angular momentum contribution has been provided. Thus this\nsum rule cannot be tested and is unfalsifiable.\n3.3. Transversity in the Drell-Yan reaction\nThe conceptually simplest practical way to measure transversity is to exploit the Drell\u21d1(\u21d3)\n\u21d1(\u21d3)\nYan reaction in doubly transversely polarized hadron-hadron collisions h1 + h2 \u2212\u2192\n\u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 + X, involving the hard scattering process\nq + q\u0304 \u2212\u2192 \u03b3 \u2217 \u2212\u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 .\n\n(19)\n\n\fSpin-polarized high-energy scattering of charged leptons on nucleons\n\n34\n\nThe high-energy cross section for this reaction is obtained by convoluting the quark\ndistribution in one of the hadrons with the antiquark distribution in the other hadron\nand with the cross section for q + q\u0304 \u2212\u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 , where the latter can be calculated in\nperturbation theory (one photon in the intermediate state plus higher-order corrections).\nTransversity can be studied in Drell-Yan experiments with transversely polarized (anti-)\nprotons because the quark and antiquark preferentially annihilate into a vector boson\nwhen their transverse spins are parallel. Hence the double-spin asymmetry AT T is\ncapable of measuring the correlation between the spin of the quark in one of the hadrons\nwith that of the antiquark in the other hadron. This double-spin asymmetry is therefore\nsensitive to the product of the transversity distributions for quarks and antiquarks\ncarrying momentum fractions x1 and x2 respectively:\n\u03c3 \u21d1\u21d1 \u2212 \u03c3 \u21d1\u21d3 X 2\n\u221d\nef \u03b4qf /h1 (x1 )\u03b4 q\u0304f /h2 (x2 ).\n(20)\nAT T (x1 , x2 ) = \u21d1\u21d1\n\u03c3 + \u03c3 \u21d1\u21d3\nf\n\nThe momentum fractions of the quark and antiquark can be reconstructed from the\ninvariant mass and net longitudinal momentum of the muon pair into which they\nannihilate. The struck q\u0304 in a Drell-Yan reaction can be either a sea or valence quark\nin an incident antiproton (or meson or proton). In the interpretation of the data for\np+p \u2212\u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 +X, one x value can be associated with the q\u0304 by considering asymmetric\nevents where the momentum fraction of one of the initial quarks was so high that it is\nvery unlikely to have been an antiquark since the latter carry only small momentum\nfractions. As the Drell-Yan cross section depends on products of PDFs, determining the\noverall normalization may in general be ambiguous. In the case of p\u0304 + p \u2212\u2192 \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 + X\nthere is no such ambiguity as the same valence PDF of the proton appears as a product\nwith itself. Once this normalization has been determined, it can be used to determine the\nnormalization of sea quarks in pp scattering. Plans are being laid at several laboratories\nto exploit this reaction to measure transversity [88, 89].\nAll existing experimental constraints on transversity are based on the sensitivity of\nfragmentation to the transverse polarization of the struck quark in processes other than\nDrell-Yan, as manifested in single-spin asymmetries. These will be discussed in Section\n3.5.\n3.4. Intrinsic parton transverse momentum\n\nPartons can also have momentum pT transverse to the infinite momentum of the hadron.\nHence parton distributions can be introduced that depend not only on x but also on\npT [90, 91] and have interpretations as number densities or differences between number\ndensities [92]. Only three of these distributions survive integration over pT leading to\nthe familiar PDFs that depend only on x. These have already been discussed in section\n1. They are the spin-averaged distribution qf (x, pT ), the helicity distribution \u2206qf (x, pT )\nand the transversity distribution \u03b4qf (x, pT ). However, many other twist-2 distributions\nexist and they have probabilistic interpretations similar to that of integrated PDFs [92].\n\n\fSpin-polarized high-energy scattering of charged leptons on nucleons\n\n35\n\nThese distributions\u00a7 are sometimes known as Transverse-Momentum-Dependent (TMD)\nparton distributions (TMD-PDFs, or simply TMDs). In the rest of this subsection we\ntake the unpolarized case as an example.\nWhen a quark in a nucleon absorbs a hard virtual photon, the resulting momentum\nof the quark is the sum of its initial momentum and the momentum transfered from the\nlepton. In leading order \u03b1s , any momentum component transverse to the virtual photon\ndirection thus originates from the intrinsic transverse momentum pT of the parton before\nthe scattering, described by qf (x, pT ).\nThe distribution of hadrons h in a jet originating from a fast quark of flavor f\nis described by fragmentation functions Df /h (z, kT ). Here kT = ph,T \u2212 zpT is the\ntransverse momentum of the hadron relative to the momentum of the fragmenting\nquark. In DIS, the factorized semi-inclusive cross section for producing a hadron with\ntransverse momentum ph,T with respect to the virtual photon momentum is obtained by\nconvolutingk the transverse-momentum-dependent parton distributions qf (x, pT ) with\nthese fragmentation functions:\nX\n\u03c3 ep\u2192ehX (xB , z, ph,T ) \u221d\nqf (xB , pT ) \u2297 Df /h (z, kT ) \u2297 \u03b4(zpT +kT \u2212ph,T ).(21)\nf\n\nThese fragmentation functions are expected to be universal, i.e. independent of both\nprocess and target [93]. For example, the distribution of hadrons in jets produced in\ne+ e\u2212 \u2192 hadrons is described by the same fragmentation functions that describe jets\nin DIS. However, as discussed in section 3.6, initial-state interactions (ISIs) and finalstate interactions (FSIs) need to be considered before the concept of universality can be\nliterally applied.\n3.5. Semi-inclusive DIS and the Collins effect\n\nWhen a transversely polarized quark fragments into hadrons, the structure of the jet is\nsensitive to the polarization of the quark. In particular, the orientation of the transverse\nspin direction together with the quark's momentum defines a plane relative to which\nthe momentum distribution of hadrons may not be left-right symmetric. To understand\nhow this may occur, we consider a simple model for the case of fragmentation into\npions: in this process for example a quark with spin pointing up needs to pick up from\nthe vacuum an anti-quark with spin down in order to form a spin zero state. The 3 P0\nmodel for quark anti-quark pair creation [94] postulates that the q q\u0304 pair is created with\n'vacuum quantum numbers' J P = 0+ , the simplest configuration of which is S = 1,\nL = 1 and no gluon. This model is based on the idea that as the QCD string between\nthe fragmenting quark and the target remnant is stretched and stores energy, a q q\u0304 pair\ncan tunnel from the vacuum to remove some of the stored energy and the string breaks.\nDue to angular momentum conservation, this model suggests that the q q\u0304 pair is thus\n\u00a7 In the 'Amsterdam notation', distributions that do not 'survive' integration over d2 pT are signified\nby the superscript \u22a5.\nk Only for Gaussian dependences can these convolutions be factorized.\n\n\fSpin-polarized high-energy scattering of charged leptons on nucleons\n\n36\n\nFigure 13. Behind the leading quark (q0 ) moving along \u1e91 a string forms, which\neventually breaks through the formation of the q\u03041 q1 pair. In the 3 P0 model, the q\u0304q\npair has orbital angular momentum in the opposite direction as the spin of the q\u0304q pair,\ni.e. in the case of fragmentation into pions (spin 0) in the same direction as the spin\nof the leading quark. Since the antiquark from the pair is expected to be produced\ncloser to the leading quark as the produced quark, this implies that the produced\nantiquark inherits a positive transverse momentum ~kq\u03041 \u22a5 in the \u0177 direction from the\norbital motion (for a leading quark polarized in the \u0177-direction).\n\nproduced with orbital angular momentum in the same direction (i.e. up in this case) as\nthe spin of the fragmenting quark in the produced pion (see figure 13). The antiquark\nthat merges with the fragmenting quark should retain some of that transverse orbital\nangular momentum, causing it to move to the left (when looking into the direction of\nmotion of the fragmenting quark with spin up) [95]. The pion inherits the transverse\nmomentum carried by the antiquark.\n\u22a5\nThe fragmentation function H1,f\n/h (z, kT ) describing the left-right asymmetry in the\nfragmentation of a transversely polarized quark of flavor f into a hadron h was identified\nby Collins [96], and found to be chirally odd. Its combination with transversity \u03b4qf (x)\nthat describes the distribution of transversely polarized quarks thus gives rise to a\ncorrelation between the transverse target spin and the transverse momentum of the\nproduced hadron(s). The associated asymmetry is proportional to sin (\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6q ), where\n\u03c6q is the azimuthal angle of the polarization vector of the fragmenting quark about the\nvirtual photon direction and \u03c6 is the azimuthal angle of the trajectory of the produced\nhadron h. However, the polarization direction of the struck quark and that of the\nfragmenting quark are not identical. In QED, when the electron emits a high-momentum\nvirtual photon, the electron helicity is conserved and therefore the orientation of the\nelectron spin is rotated in the lepton scattering plane. The virtual photon inherits the\nchange in angular momentum and is thus linearly polarized in the lepton scattering\nplane. When a quark absorbs this linearly polarized photon, its spin component along\nthe polarization direction of the photon tends to flip. For a transversely polarized\nquark, this implies that its polarization direction is on average tilted symmetrically with\nrespect to the normal of the lepton scattering plane. For azimuthal angles measured\nrelative to the lepton scattering plane, as illustrated in figure 14, the tilt results in\n\n\fSpin-polarized high-energy scattering of charged leptons on nucleons\n\n~\u22a5\nS\n\n~k \u2032\n~k\n\n37\n\n~q\n\n\u03c6S\n\nP~h\u22a5\nP~h\ny\n\n\u03c6\n\nx\nz\nFigure 14.

The resulting sin (\u03c6 + \u03c6S )\nangular dependence can thus be used to extract the product of transversity and the\nCollins fragmentation function.\nHowever, this 'Collins effect' is not the only mechanism that can give rise to\na correlation between the target spin and the momenta of final state hadrons. A\ncorrelation between transverse momenta of quarks in the target and the target nucleon\nspin may give rise to a sin (\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6S ) asymmetry, as we will now discuss.\n3.6. Sivers effect\nIn a target that is polarized transverse to the virtual-photon direction (e.g. up), the\nquarks in the target nucleon can exhibit a (left/right) asymmetry of the distribution\nfq/p\u2191 (x, pT ) in their transverse momentum pT\n(Pb \u00d7 pT ) * S\n,\n(22)\nM\nwhere S is the spin of the target nucleon and Pb is a unit vector opposite to the\ndirection of the virtual-photon momentum. The fact that such a term may be present\n\u22a5q\nin (22) is known as the Sivers effect and the function f1T\n(x, p2T ) is known as the Sivers\nfunction [97]. The latter vanishes in a naive parton picture since (Pb \u00d7 pT ) * S is odd\nunder naive time reversal (a property known as naive-T-odd), where one merely reverses\nthe direction of all momenta and spins without interchanging the initial and final states.\nIn fact, until a few years ago, it was believed that full time reversal invariance of QCD\nforbids the existence of the Sivers effect. However, then it was realized that a FSI\nmediated by soft gluon(s) between the struck quark and the remainder of the target\n\u22a5q\n(x, p2T )\nfq/p\u2191 (x, pT ) = f1q (x, p2T ) \u2212 f1T\n\n\fSpin-polarized high-energy scattering of charged leptons on nucleons\n\n38\n\nnucleon, before the quark fragments into hadrons, could avoid this restriction [98]. This\nled to a generalization of our understanding of what is meant by a parton distribution\nand its universality, and how it may appear in expressions for matrix elements of\nprocesses. The momentum fraction x, which is equal to xB in DIS experiments,\nrepresents the longitudinal momentum of the quark before it absorbs the virtual photon,\nas it is determined solely from the kinematic properties of the virtual photon and the\ntarget nucleon. In this new view, in DIS the transverse momentum pT represents the\nasymptotic transverse momentum of the active quark after it has absorbed the virtual\nphoton and then left the target but still before it fragments into hadrons. Thus the\nSivers function for semi-inclusive DIS includes the FSI between struck quark and target\nremnant, and time reversal invariance no longer requires that it vanishes. Indeed, time\nreversal not only reverses the signs of all spins and momenta, but also transforms FSIs\ninto ISIs. It has been shown that the Sivers function relevant for SIDIS and that relevant\nfor Drell-Yan (DY) processes must have opposite signs [98],\n\u22a5\n\u22a5\nf1T\n(x, p2T )SIDIS = \u2212f1T\n(x, p2T )DY ,\n\n(23)\n\nwhere the asymmetry in DY arises from the ISI between the incoming antiquark and\nthe target. The experimental verification of this relation would provide a test of the\ncurrent understanding of the Sivers effect within QCD. While the argument leading to\n(23) is nonperturbative, it is instructive to elucidate its physical origin in the context\nof a perturbative picture: for instance, when the virtual photon in a DIS process hits a\nred quark, the spectators must be collectively anti-red in order to form a color-neutral\nbound state, and thus attract the struck quark. In DY, when an anti-red antiquark\nannihilates with a target quark, the target quark must be red in order to merge into a\nphoton, which carries no color. Since the proton was colorless before the scattering, the\nspectators must be anti-red and thus repel the approaching antiquark [99].\nAnother reason why the Sivers effect is attracting attention is that it relates to\nthe correlation between the orbital angular momentum of partons and the spin of the\nparent nucleon. A semi-classical argument can help to understand how. Should quarks\nhave orbital angular momentum, it would be correlated with the spin of the nucleon, as\nthe latter defines the only preferred direction. When viewed in the nucleon rest frame,\nquarks orbiting in a transversely polarized nucleon move towards the virtual photon\non one side of the nucleon but away from it on the opposite side. Upon boosting the\nnucleon to the infinite-momentum frame, the quarks on one side of the nucleon with\na particular momentum fraction x thus appear to have larger longitudinal momenta\nthan on the other side. Since parton distributions are rapidly falling functions of x,\nshifting them towards larger (smaller) x results in an increased (decreased) probability\nof interaction when viewed at a fixed value of x. The result is that, at a given value\nof x, more quarks absorb photons on the left or right side of the nucleon when the\nnucleon spin is pointing e.g. up. As the struck quark moves away, it experiences an\nattractive FSI that tends to 'focus' it towards the axis through the center of the nucleon\nalong the direction of the virtual photon (see figure 15). Thus the excess of interactions\n\n\fSpin-polarized high-energy scattering of charged leptons on nucleons\n\np~\u03b3\n\n39\n\n\u03c0+\nd\nu\n\nFigure 15. A correlation between the nucleon spin and the quark orbital angular\nmomentum, in combination with an attractive final state interaction, gives rise to a\nSivers effect for u (d) quarks imparting a transverse momentum that is on average\ndirected upward (downward).\n\non one side results in a tendency of the struck quark and hence the hadron jet to be\ndeflected towards the opposite side, producing a sinusoidal azimuthal distribution of the\nhadrons relative to the transverse polarization direction of the target nucleon. Quarks\nof different flavours may have different spin-orbit correlations, and also tend to produce\ndifferent populations of hadron types. Hence different hadron types may have different\nazimuthal distributions.\nThe type of deflection shown in figure 15 also arises in optics when a convex lens\nis illuminated asymmetrically, e.g. when only one side of the lens is illuminated with a\nlaser beam parallel to the axis of the lens. The beam is then deflected towards the lens\naxis and the outgoing beam has a left-right 'momentum asymmetry' [100]. Because of\nthis analogy, the above mechanism has been called 'chromodynamic lensing' [101].\nAs the asymmetry is caused by the orbital motion of the quarks, it is a (left-right)\nasymmetry relative to the direction of the (vertical) transverse target polarization, i.e.\nproportional to sin(\u03c6\u2212\u03c6S ) in SIDIS. This differs from the sin(\u03c6+\u03c6S ) angular dependence\ncaused by the Collins effect, thus permitting the two contributions to be separated\nthrough the use of transverse target polarization.\nThe Sivers function not only provides a clue about the orbital angular momentum\nstructure of the nucleon wave function, but in addition carries important information\nabout the complex phase structure of the FSI [102].\n3.7. Boer-Mulders effect\nEven when the target nucleon is unpolarized, there can exist a correlation between\nthe distribution in transverse momentum and transverse polarization of its quarks.\nThe Boer-Mulders effect is a possible dependence of the distribution fq\u2191 /p (x, pT ) of\n~q\ntransversely polarized quarks in an unpolarized target on the transverse polarization S\nof the quarks:\n\"\n#\nb\n(\nP\n\u00d7\np\n)\n*\nS\n1 q\nT\nq\n2\nf1 (x, p2T ) \u2212 h\u22a5q\n,\n(24)\nfq\u2191 /p (x, pT ) =\n1 (x, pT )\n2\nM\n\n\fSpin-polarized high-energy scattering of charged leptons on nucleons\n\na)\n\nb)\n\nc)\n\nd)\n\ne)\n\nf)\n\n40\n\nFigure 16. Illustration for the interplay between transverse momenta from the\nBoer-Mulders and the Collins effect, leading to a cos 2\u03c6 asymmetry: a) 'primordial'\ntransverse spin distribution in an unpolarized target, b) transverse momentum from\nthe Collins effect for hypothetical SIDIS without transverse spin flip, c) transverse\nmomentum from the attractive FSI, d) after the virtual photon absorption, the\ntransverse spin component in the (horizontal) lepton scattering plane has flipped, e)\ntransverse momentum from the Collins effect including the transverse spin flip, f) net\ntransverse momentum from FSI and Collins effect.\n2\nand the Boer-Mulders function h\u22a5q\n1 (x, pT ) embodies this correlation [103], which can\nnaturally arise from non-perturbative spin-orbit interactions.\nIn the case of the Sivers effect, the relevant spin is that of the target nucleon,\nwhereas here it is that of the struck quark. However, both effects can be understood\nto arise in part from the preference of the virtual photon to absorb on a quark with\nexcess momentum fraction associated with its orbital motion, because of the monotonic\ndecrease with x of the unpolarized PDF. Thus a quark found on the top (bottom) [left]\n{right} side of the nucleon, as seen by the virtual photon, will tend to have orbital\nangular momentum pointing right (left) [up] {down} (on first reading it may be helpful\nto consider only the first option and compare to figure 16). If the quark spin is correlated\nwith its orbital angular momentum as represented by the Boer-Mulders function, then its\npolarization will have a similar (or opposite) spatial pattern (figure 16a). As described in\nsection 3.5, the quark polarization affects the transverse momentum of produced hadrons\nvia the Collins effect. Quarks with polarization pointing right (left) [up] {down} may\nbe deflected e.g. up (down) [left] {right} , or the opposite depending on the sign of the\nCollins fragmentation function. We first consider the simpler case of exchange of a scalar\nboson rather than the vector photon, where the former cannot carry any information\nabout the orientation of the lepton scattering plane so that the initial quark transverse\npolarization direction persists through the photoabsorption process. Then the combined\neffect would be a net 'focussing' or 'defocussing' of the produced hadrons relative to the\n\n\fSpin-polarized high-energy scattering of charged leptons on nucleons\n\n41\n\ndirection of the exchanged boson, according to the product of the Collins function with\nthe Boer-Mulders function representing the original spin-orbit correlation of the quark\n(figure 16b). However, we must beware that this term '(de)focussing' can be misleading\nin this context. Since one side of the nucleon is not experimentally distinguished from\nthe other, and the target nucleon is uniformly illuminated by the parallel 'beam' of\nvirtual photons, the effect only randomly scatters or smears the direction of the hadron.\nAt each azimuthal angle of the hadron direction about the virtual photon direction there\nis a net smearing effect, while the mean change of direction due to this '(de)focussing'\nis zero.\nAn additional independent axially symmetric 'focussing' action is provided by the\nattractive FSI that is crucial also for the Sivers effect (figure 16c). (The Sivers effect\nitself plays no role here because the target nucleon is unpolarized.) This FSI effect\neither enhances or competes with that in figure 16b to produce a net '(de)focussing'\naction on the direction of the produced meson relative to that of the virtual photon.\nThus for scalar exchange, the net effect may be a change in the cross section for hadron\nproduction that is independent of azimuth. For example, for observed values of the\nmeson momentum component ph,T transverse to the direction of the virtual photon that\nare larger than the most probable value, this smearing would increase the cross section.\nOn the other hand, as also described in section 3.5, for vector (photon) exchange, the\ninitial transverse quark polarization does not always persist through the photoabsorption\nprocess. Because of the linear polarization of the virtual photon in the lepton scattering\nplane, the component of the quark polarization in that plane can be flipped (figure 16d),\ninverting the effect in figure 16b only for hadron transverse momentum components\nnormal to that plane (figure 16e). Now this effect tends to enhance the FSI effect in\none plane and cancel it in the orthogonal plane (figure 16f). Since the net smearing\neffect is proportional to the magnitude of the net '(de)focussing' action, the smearing\nis different in the lepton scattering plane from that in the orthogonal plane. Hence the\neffect on the cross section can be different for hadrons produced in the lepton scattering\nplane compared to the orthogonal plane. This amounts to a cos(2\u03c6) dependence of the\nhadron azimuthal distibution, relative to the lepton scattering plane. In the absence of\nthe FSI, the inversion of the Collins effect in the lepton scattering plane (illustrated in\nfigure 16e) would not change the '(de)focussing' magnitude, which is all that matters\nfor the cross section. The necessary role of the FSI is associated with the T-odd nature\nof this Boer-Mulders effect.\nA more formal argument is also included here for the sake of completeness, as it\nmay not be easily available in the literature. The Collins effect acts as a polarimeter\nwith analyzing power \u221d H1\u22a5 (x, kT )(Pb \u00d7 kT ) * Sq\u2032 , which tags the transverse polarization\nSq\u2032 of the quark after it has absorbed the virtual photon and its component in the lepton\nscattering plane has flipped compared to Sq . Here kT is the transverse momentum of\nthe outgoing hadron relative to the momentum direction of the fragmenting quark. The\nresulting asymmetry in the hadron distribution relative to the lepton scattering plane is\nobtained by convoluting the Boer-Mulders function with the Collins function to obtain\n\n\fSpin-polarized high-energy scattering of charged leptons on nucleons\n\n42\n\nthe distribution of the transverse (with respect to the virtual photon direction) hadron\nmomentum ph,T in the final state. (For simplicity, the dependence of these functions on\nthe longitudinal momentum is not shown here.) In addition, the result must be averaged\nover the (unmeasured) transverse polarization direction \u03c6S of the quark in the initial\nstate:\nZ 2\u03c0 Z\nZ\n2\n2\nA(ph,T ) \u221d\n(25)\nd\u03c6S d pT d2 kT h\u22a5q\n1 (pT )(pT \u00d7 Sq )z\n0\n\n\u00d7 H1\u22a5 (kT2 )(kT \u00d7 Sq\u2032 )z \u03b4(pT + kT \u2212 ph,T ).\n\nAs ph,T is the only vector on which the transverse momentum integral can depend,\nrotational invariance implies\nZ\nZ\n2\n2\n\u22a5 2\nd pT d2 kT h\u22a5q\n(26)\n1 (pT ) kT,i H1 (kT ) pT,j \u03b4(pT + kT \u2212 ph,T )\n= a(p2h,T )\u03b4ij + b(p2h,T )pih,T pjh,T ,\n\nwith some suitable functions a(p2h,T ) and b(p2h,T ), yielding\nZ 2\u03c0\nh\n\u0001 i\nA(ph,T ) \u221d\nd\u03c6S a(p2h,T )Sq * Sq\u2032 + b(p2h,T ) (Sq \u00d7 ph,T )z Sq\u2032 \u00d7 ph,T z . (27)\n0\n\nThe transverse polarization of the active quark does not always flip, but events where it\ndoes not flip do not produce any asymmetry. For the determination of the asymmetry we\nthus focus on those events where the transverse spin component in the lepton scattering\nplane flips. Taking this plane to lie in the x\u0302-\u1e91 plane, the transverse polarization vectors\ntake on the form Sq = (cos \u03c6S , sin \u03c6S ) and Sq\u2032 = (\u2212 cos \u03c6S , sin \u03c6S ), yielding\nZ 2\u03c0\nd\u03c6S Sq * Sq\u2032\n=0\n(28)\n0\nZ 2\u03c0\n\u0001 \u03c0\n\u0001\n\u03c0 2\nph,T,x \u2212 p2h,T,y = p2h,T cos 2\u03c6, (29)\nd\u03c6S (Sq \u00d7 ph,T )z Sq\u2032 \u00d7 ph,T z =\n2\n2\n0\nwhere \u03c6 specifies the transverse direction of the outgoing hadron momentum ph,T . In\ncombination with (27) this implies a cos 2\u03c6 asymmetry for the transverse momentum\ndistribution of the produced hadrons\nA(ph,T ) \u221d p2h,T b(p2h,T ) cos 2\u03c6\n\n(30)\n\nwhich involves a convolution b(p2h,T ) of the Boer-Mulders and Collins functions. We note\nhere that a flip of the quark polarization direction relative to the normal of the lepton\nscattering plane is essential to provide a reference plane (the lepton scattering plane) for\nthe transverse momentum of the outgoing hadrons and thus making the Boer-Mulders\neffect observable, just as it was essential for separating the Collins from the Sivers effect\nin SIDIS. We also note that the Boer-Mulders effect is a spin effect, even though no spin\nis being measured.\nAlternatively, one can also study the cos 2\u03c6 asymmetry in the unpolarized DrellYan process, in which case \u03c6 is the azimuthal angle of the \u03bc+ \u03bc\u2212 plane about the virtual\nphoton axis with respect to the incident proton trajectory.\n\n\fSpin-polarized high-energy scattering of charged leptons on nucleons\n\n43\n\nWhile ISI/FSI are obviously essential features for the Sivers and Boer-Mulders\nfunctions, they affect all twist-2 pT -dependent parton distributions. However, this does\nnot spoil standard universality, as all other pT -dependent PDFs are (naive) T-even\nand thus the ISI in DY has the same effect as the FSI in SIDIS. Nevertheless, their\npT dependence is expected to differ from the 'intrinsic' pT dependence that one would\nfor example obtain theoretically through the evaluation of a matrix element of a local\noperator, as is usually done in lattice gauge theory (see section 4.4).\n3.8. Recent semi-inclusive data with transverse target polarization\nAlmost 20 years ago, surprisingly large single-spin asymmetries were observed in\ninclusive production of pions by beams of polarized protons and anti-protons [104].\n(Recently this phenomenon was also observed at the higher energies of RHIC [105, 106],\nwhere the cross section for these reactions can be understood within the framework\nof perturbative QCD.) Various theoretical interpretations were proposed, including the\nCollins and Sivers effects. However, no way of disentangling these effects on those data\ncould be found. A similar ambiguity plagued the interpretation of the first substantial\nsingle-spin asymmetries, with respect to longitudinal target polarization, observed in\nthe semi-inclusive leptoproduction of mesons by the Hermes experiment [107]. When\nthe target is polarized along the lepton beam axis, both Collins and Sivers mechanisms\nproduce a common sinusoidal behavior in the azimuthal angle \u03c6 of the detected hadron\nabout the direction of the virtual photon, with respect to the lepton scattering plane.\nOn the other hand, when the target polarization is orthogonal to the beam axis\n(more precisely, when it is orthogonal to the direction of the virtual photon), the\nazimuthal angle \u03c6S of the axis of transverse target polarization resolves the effects of\nthe two mechanisms into distinctive signatures: sin(\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6S ) for the Sivers mechanism,\nand sin(\u03c6 + \u03c6S ) for the Collins mechanism [103]. In DIS, the Collins effect serves\nas a 'polarimeter' sensitive to transverse quark polarization to reveal its correlation\nwith transverse target polarization, which is known as transversity. As described in\nsection 3.4, the Collins mechanism depends on the influence of the struck quark's\npolarization on the transverse momentum kT acquired by the produced hadron in the\nfragmentation process, in particular on the component of kT that is orthogonal to the\nquark's transverse polarization. This 'measurement' of the struck quark's polarization\noccurs after its spin component in the lepton scattering plane has been flipped by the\nphoto-absorption. The orientation of the lepton scattering plane is 'remembered' by the\nvirtual photon because that is the plane of its linear polarization. Hence the Collins\nmechanism is sensitive to the orientation of the lepton scattering plane from which\nthe azimuthal angles are measured, as indicated by the dependence on \u03c6 + \u03c6S . In\ncontrast, as described in section 3.6, the Sivers effect can be understood in terms of\nretention by the struck quark of the pT that it had in the target due to a correlation\nwith transverse target polarization. This transverse momentum tends to be inherited\nby a forward hadron that may 'contain' this quark. Hence in either case, the hadron\n\n\fSpin-polarized high-energy scattering of charged leptons on nucleons\n\n44\n\nph,T is correlated with transverse target polarization. However, the different azimuthal\ndependences allow their experimental separation, and semi-inclusive DIS measurements\nwith a transversely polarized target were eagerly anticipated.\nThe first such data were reported a few years ago by Hermes [114]. The\ncross section asymmetry with respect to target polarization was extracted as a twoh\ndimensional distribution in \u03c6 versus \u03c6S . The Collins azimuthal moment h sin(\u03c6+\u03c6S )iU T\nh\n\nand Sivers moment h sin(\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6S )iU T of the virtual-photon asymmetry were extracted\nin the fit\nAhU T (\u03c6, \u03c6S )\nh\nh\n= h sin(\u03c6 + \u03c6S )iU T sin(\u03c6 + \u03c6S ) + h sin(\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6S )iU T sin(\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6S ) .(31)\n2\nThis simultaneous extraction of both contributions was shown by detailed Monte Carlo\nsimulations to avoid significant cross-contamination, even when they have very different\nmagnitudes in the context of a limited detector acceptance. These initial data on the\nproton target provided evidence for both Collins and Sivers signals. On the other hand,\nasymmetries measured by Compass using higher energy muons on a deuteron target\nare consistent with zero [115]. As illustrated in figures 17 and 21, the nonzero results\nfor the proton are now firmly established by recent more precise preliminary data [108],\nwhile the most recent results for the deuteron remain consistent with zero [109]. For the\nproton target, the Collins azimuthal amplitude for \u03c0 + is clearly positive and non-zero,\nwhile it is negative and at least as large for \u03c0 \u2212 . The latter finding was a surprise because\nof the contrast with the double-spin longitudinal asymmetries shown in figure 7. In that\ncase asymmetries for pions of both charges are positive, even though \u2206u is positive and\n\u2206d is negative, albeit smaller in magnitude. The reason there is that both charges are\nproduced mostly from photoabsorption by u quarks [63], but not as dominantly for \u03c0 \u2212 .\nLattice calculations and models predict that transversity densities resemble the helicity\ndensities, at least at large x where valence quarks dominate, and where the \u03c0 + /\u03c0 \u2212\ncontrast is most apparent in figure 17. Hence efforts to find an explanation focused on\nthe Collins fragmentation function.\nThe explanation that emerged for the larger negative \u03c0 \u2212 amplitudes is a substantial\nmagnitude for the disfavoured Collins function describing e.g. the fragmentation of u\nquarks to \u03c0 \u2212 mesons, and with a sign opposite to that of the favoured function. Opposite\nsigns could be expected in the light of the string model of fragmentation discussed in\nsection 3.5. If a favoured pion forms as the string end created by the first break,\na disfavoured pion from the next break will inherit transverse momentum from the\nfirst break in the opposite direction from that acquired by the first pion. Such a p\u03c0,T\nanticorrelation between favoured and disfavoured pions is demonstrated by the Jetset\nsimulation [116], which is based on a string fragmentation model. Hence any correlation\nbetween p\u03c0,T and another kinematic or spin observable should have the opposite sign\nfor favoured and disfavoured pions.\nThis expectation for the Collins function has recently been confirmed by results\nfor both favoured and disfavoured functions from a simultaneous fit of these DIS data\ntogether with information about the azimuthal structure of jets in e+ e\u2212 collisions from\n\n\f45\n\nSpin-polarized high-energy scattering of charged leptons on nucleons\n0.12\n\nsin (\u03c6S+ \u03c6h)\n\n0.1\n\n\u03c0+\n\n0.08\n\nHERMES\npreliminary\n\n0.06\n\n2002-2005\n\nAUT\n\n0.04\n0.02\n0\n\n-0.02\n0.02\n\nsin (\u03c6S+ \u03c6h)\n\n0\n-0.02\n-0.04\n\nAUT\n\n-0.06\n-0.08\n\n\u03c0-\n\n-0.1\n\n-0.12\n-0.14\n0\n\n0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\nsin (\u03c6S+ \u03c6h + \u03c0)\n\nx\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nPT (GeV)\n\nCOMPASS\n\n2003-2004\n\n0.05\n\nAUT\n\n0\n-0.05\n-0.1\n\n\u03c0-\n\n0.1\n0.05\n0\n\nAUT\n\nsin (\u03c6S+ \u03c6h + \u03c0)\n\n1\n\nz\n\n\u03c0+\n\n0.1\n\n0.8\n\n-0.05\n-0.1\n-2\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n1\n\nx\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\nz\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\nPT (GeV)\n\nFigure 17.

The\ncurves are fits to the data, as described in the text [111]. The error bands on these\ncurves arise from the statistical uncertainties of the data, but the procedure chosen\nimplies that they are several times larger than the conventional definition given by,\ne.g., the Particle Data Group [71].

Two alternative jet asymmetries extracted from Belle data [112] for\ne+ e\u2212 \u2192 2 jets, compared to a fit [111] of parameterized Collins functions. The figure\nis taken from [111].\n\nthe Belle collaboration [112]. Two alternative jet asymmetries extracted from the\nBelle data are shown in figure 18. The most recent such fit [111] is shown as the\ncurves in figures 17 and 18. Such fits of data from these three experiments produced\nthe first experimental determination of the transversity distributions of u and d quarks,\nthe most recent example of which is shown in figure 19. At this stage, the quark sea is\nneglected. As is the case for the helicity distributions, transversity is found to be positive\nfor u quarks and negative and smaller in magnitude for d quarks. For both flavours,\nthe magnitudes are of order half of the Soffer positivity bound [85]. Especially for u\nquarks and for larger values of x (bearing in mind that there are no data for x > 0.3),\nthe extracted density is smaller than existing model predictions [117\u2013119]. This fit also\nyields values for the Collins fragmentation function, shown in figure 20. They confirm\nthat indeed the disfavoured Collins function is opposite in sign and larger in magnitude\nthan the favoured function. The initially surprising features of the Collins asymmetry\ndata now appear to be well understood. A further confirmation of this recently appeared\nin the form of preliminary single-spin asymmetry data for unidentified hadrons from the\nproton by the Compass collaboration [120]. These data for the Collins asymmetry are\nconsistent with predictions based on this fit of earlier data from Hermes on the proton\nand from Compass on the deuteron.\nThe Sivers azimuthal amplitudes for production of both pions and kaons from the\nproton shown in the upper panels of figure 21 are clearly positive and nonzero for the\npositive charges. This constitutes the first evidence from leptoproduction for a nonzero\nT-odd parton distribution function. We note here that these Sivers amplitudes receive\nno contributions that are suppressed by 1/Q (twist-3) [91].

The pT dependence in the\nright panels was chosen to be the same as that used for the unpolarized distributions,\nwhich was derived from fitting the azimuthal dependence of unpolarized SIDIS cross\nsections. The 'Torino notation' used in the figure for the transversity distributions is\nequivalent to the 'Amsterdam notation' used elsewhere in this paper. (This is not true\nfor, e.g., TMDs [110].) The outermost (blue) curves represent the Soffer positivity\nbounds [85]. The error bands have the same meaning as in figure 17. The figure is\ntaken from [111].\n\nboth \u03c0 + and K + is dominated by u quarks, this positive value with the definition of\n\u22a5\nazimuthal angles used here implies a negative value for the Sivers function f1T\nof this\nflavour [110]. The amplitudes for the negatively charged mesons are consistent with zero.\nTheir interpretation is complicated by competition between fragmentation of quarks of\nat least two flavours. Remarkably, for the proton target, the K + amplitudes are on\naverage much larger than those for \u03c0 + , even though one might suppose that they are\nsimilarly dominated by photoabsorption by u quarks. The amplitudes for the deuteron\ntarget measured by Compass are all consistent with zero (as are their preliminary Sivers\namplitudes on the proton for unidentified hadrons [120]).\nThe curves on these figures from [113] represent an 11-parameter fit to data for\npions and kaons from Hermes on the proton and from Compass on the deuteron,\nextracting representations of the Sivers functions for all six quark flavours. The shapes\n \u0304 s and s\u0304 were constrained to be the same. The success\nof all four sea flavours \u016b, d,\n+\nin explaining the large K amplitudes for the proton depends on the use of a recent\nfit of unpolarized fragmentation functions [121], which differs from all previous such\n+\n+\nfits in that Ds\u0304K (z) \u226b DuK (z) over the whole z range.

In the left\npanels, the kT -integrated functions are shown as ratios to twice the corresponding\nunpolarized fragmentation functions, while in the right panels, the functions are\nevaluated at fixed values of z. The Collins function is represented in the Torino\nnotation, which is related to the Amsterdam notation used elsewhere in this paper by\n2|ph,T |\nH1\u22a5q (z, p2h,T ) [110]. The outermost (blue) curves represent\n\u2206N Dh/q\u2191 (z, p2h,T ) = zM\nh\nthe positivity limits. The error bands have the same meaning as in figure 17. The\nfigure is taken from [111].\n\nproduction need not be dominated by u quarks, allowing s\u0304 quark distributions to be\nprobed.\nValues of the Sivers functions resulting from the fit are shown in figure 22. The\nSivers function for d quarks is found to be at least as large in magnitude as that for u\nquarks. Their signs agree with expectations based on an attractive final-state interaction\nbetween the struck quark and spectator diquark (see section 3.4). Such a relatively large\nmagnitude of the Sivers function for d quarks could be explained by a similar trend in\nthe known relative contributions of u and d quarks to the anomalous magnetic moment\nof the proton, as explained in section 4.3. Hence the data appear to support a profound\nconnection between static and partonic properties of the proton. Furthermore, there is\nevidence for a significant role of sea quarks. In considering the statistical significance of\nthis finding, it is useful to bear in mind that the method of assigning the error bands\nresults in values much larger than those that would correspond to the definition of\ne.g., the Particle Data Group [71].

The error bars\nrepresent the statistical uncertainties, while for the proton target there is an additional\ncommon 8% scale uncertainty. The curves are fits to the data, as described in the\ntext [113]. The error bands on these curves arise from the statistical uncertainties of\nthe data, but the procedure chosen implies that they are several times larger than\nthe conventional definition given by, e.g., the Particle Data Group [71]. On the other\nhand, uncertainties related to model assumptions are not estimated.

Thus continues the exciting\nstory of a feature of proton structure that only a few years ago was (incorrectly) asserted\nto be forbidden by fundamental time reversal invariance [98].\n4.

Comparison between a) the Compton amplitude with two photon vertices\nand a quark propagating between them and b) a form factor with just one photon\nvertex.\n\nA similar factorization of the scattering amplitude occurs in Deeply Virtual Compton\nScattering (DVCS) [122], \u03b3 \u2217 p \u2212\u2192 \u03b3p, where \u03b3 \u2217 is a space-like photon with virtuality\nq 2 = \u2212Q2 < 0. As in DIS, the process is best interpreted in a frame in which the\nnucleon has infinite momentum opposite to that of the virtual photon. In the Bjorken\nlimit, and for a momentum transfer t to the proton much less than Q2 , the DVCS\namplitude factorizes into a convolution of the Compton amplitude for scattering off a\nquark constituting the hard part, and a quark correlation function, constituting the soft\npart of the amplitude. After factorization has been applied to the DVCS amplitude,\nits matrix element has much in common with the matrix element describing the form\nfactor (figure 23b). Indeed, the soft part entering the DVCS amplitude becomes identical\nto the soft part entering the form factor. However, the DVCS process provides more\n'surgical' access. In the case of the DVCS amplitude, the hard part has a dependence on\nthe quark momentum fraction appearing in the quark propagator, which is not present\nin the form factor. The additional kinematic degree of freedom provided by the hard\npart in the DVCS process provides access to the dependence of the soft part on the\nmomentum fraction x of the active quark. This motivates the concept of Generalized\nParton Distributions (GPDs) as a description of the soft part that enters the DVCS\namplitude [123]. What is gained by introducing this concept is that universality as\nintroduced in section 1 applies with an extended scope, now also encompassing form\nfactors and hard exclusive processes - the same GPDs that describe elastic form factors\nas well as the soft part of DVCS should also appear in other hard exclusive reactions. In\neach of these reactions, they appear convoluted with the appropriate coefficient function\nrepresenting the hard part. In section 4.5ff, it is discussed how and to what extent\nexclusive reactions can be used to constrain GPDs experimentally.\nIn elastic scattering, the photon can couple to any of the quark lines connecting\nthe two 'soft blobs' in figure 23b, leaving the nucleon intact. The form factor is the\ncoherent superposition of such diagrams for all the quarks of all flavors in the nucleon.\nThe experimental decomposition of the nucleon form factor into the contributions from\n\n\fSpin-polarized high-energy scattering of charged leptons on nucleons\n\n52\n\nvarious quark flavors has been partially accomplished through the comparison of proton\nand neutron form factors using isospin symmetry, and the interpretation of parityviolating electron scattering. Two flavor combinations (2u \u2212 d \u2212 s) and 2(d \u2212 u \u2212 s)\nare obtained from the proton and neutron electromagnetic form factors using charge\nsymmetry. A further combination is accessible in parity violating electron scattering,\nbut the corresponding constraints are not very strong yet [124].\nHowever, what is still needed for a more comprehensive understanding of the\nmicroscopic physics that underlies form factors is their decomposition with respect\nto the momentum fraction of the quark that absorbs the photon. Generalized\nparton distributions (GPDs) embody this information. By definition, they provide a\ndecomposition of form factors evaluated at a given value of the invariant momentum\ntransfer t = (pf in \u2212 pini )2 on the target, with respect to the average momentum fraction\nx = 21 (xini + xf in ) of the active quark of flavor f :\nZ\nZ\nf\nf\n(32)\ndx E f (x, \u03be, t) = F2f (t)\ndx H (x, \u03be, t) = F1 (t)\nZ\nZ\nf\nf\ne\ne f (x, \u03be, t) = Gf (t),\ndx H (x, \u03be, t) = GA (t)\ndx E\n(33)\nP\n\nwhere xini and xf in are the initial and final momentum fractions of the active quark\nwith respect to the average momentum 21 (pini + pf in ), and the dimensionless 'skewness'\n\u03be = 21 (xini \u2212 xf in ) represents their difference. Thus the linear combinations x \u00b1 \u03be\nrepresent the momentum fraction carried by the quark before/after the hard interactions.\nThe functions F1f (t), F2f (t), GfA (t), and GfP (t) are the contributions to the Dirac, Pauli,\naxial, and pseudoscalar form factors from quark flavor f , respectively, and the functions\ne f , and E\nef are the quark GPDs providing their momentum decomposition.\nH f , Ef , H\nOne can thus imagine the form factor being the result of adding (or integrating over)\nthe contributions from all possible quark momentum fractions x (here x is not to be\nidentified with the Bjorken variable xB defined in section 1).\nJust like the ordinary (forward) PDFs, GPDs are subject to higher-order corrections\nin \u03b1s and are thus also dependent on the scale Q2 (and implicitly also on the factorization\nscheme used) at which they are probed. Nevertheless, as F1f (t) and F2f (t) are defined\nas matrix elements of a conserved current, they are Q2 independent and hence the Q2\ndependence must disappear in the lowest moment of the corresponding GPDs (32).\nDecomposing the form factors with respect to the quark momentum fraction x\ninvolves the infinite-momentum direction. Hence it can make a difference whether the\nmomentum transfer to the target is parallel, or perpendicular to this momentum. The\nGPDs must therefore depend on an additional variable, here called \u03be. Its relationship\nto t/M 2 characterizes the direction of the momentum transfer relative to the infinite\nmomentum direction. The case \u03be = 0 corresponds to the case where those two momenta\nare perpendicular to each other (which is not directly experimentally accessible in\nDVCS), while nonzero \u03be corresponds to the situation where the momentum transfer\nto the target has a component parallel to the virtual photon direction. Very little is\nknown about the full x vs. \u03be dependence of GPDs, except that they might possibly be\n\n\fSpin-polarized high-energy scattering of charged leptons on nucleons\nQuark Distribution q(x)\n\n53\n\nAntiquark\nDistribution q(x)\n\nH(x,\u03be ,0)\n\nFigure 24. Model calculation for H q (x, \u03be, 0) from [125]. The thick (red) line represents\nthe forward limit \u03be = 0. Accessible to the DVCS process is the 'outer' or 'DGLAP'\nregion |x| > \u03be that represents quarks for x > \u03be and antiquarks for x < \u2212\u03be. In the\n'inner' or 'ERBL' region |x| < \u03be, the quark GPD behaves like a meson distribution\namplitude in deeply virtual meson production. The figure is taken from [125].\n\nquite complex, as indicated for example by the model calculation shown in figure 24.\nIn (32) and (33), the integration over x removes all reference to the infinite momentum\ndirection, with respect to which x and \u03be are defined. Lorentz invariance thus implies\nthat the \u03be dependence disappears in these integrals.\nOne constraint on quark GPDs comes from the fact that in the limit of vanishing\nt and \u03be, the nucleon helicity non-flip quark GPDs must reduce to the respective PDFs:\ne f (x, 0, 0) = \u2206qf (x)\nH\nfor x > 0\ne f (x, 0, 0) = \u2206q\u0304f (\u2212x) for x < 0.\nH f (x, 0, 0) = \u2212q\u0304f (\u2212x), H\nH f (x, 0, 0) = qf (x),\n\n(34)\n(35)\n\nGPDs became the focus of intense interest after the discovery of the 'Ji-relation',\nconnecting a second moment of GPDs with the total angular momentum of quarks with\nflavor f or gluons, which is the respective contribution to the nucleon spin 12 [19]:\n1 X\nJf + JG ,\n(36)\n=\n2\nf\nwhere\n\nZ 1\n\u0002\n\u0003\n1\ndx x H f (x, \u03be, t) + E f (x, \u03be, t) ,\nJf = lim\n2 t\u21920 \u22121\nZ 1\n\u0002\n\u0003\n1\ndx H G (x, \u03be, t) + E G (x, \u03be, t) .\nJG = lim\n2 t\u21920 0\n\n(37)\n(38)\n\nNote that no \u03be-dependence remains in (37) and (38) after integration over x, although\nthe two unpolarized quark GPDs H f and E f have to be evaluated at some common\nvalue of \u03be.

However, in principle (37) can be\napplied for any polarization direction of the nucleon target. Nevertheless, (37) finds its\nmost important application in the helicity sum rule through\n1\n(39)\nJf = (\u2206qf + \u2206q\u0304f ) + Lf ,\n2\nsince in that case at least the quark helicity contribution \u2206qf + \u2206q\u0304f in Jf has a partonic\ninterpretation. (An attempt to associate a partonic interpretation of (37) in the case of\ntransversely polarized nucleons can be found in [126].)\nThe gauge invariant orbital\n\u0010 angular\n\u0011 momentum Lf of quarks is defined through the\n\u2020\n~ \u03c8f .

General properties of GPDs\nGPDs must satisfy several relations arising from fundamental symmetries or\nconservation laws:\n\u2022 Invariance under time reversal (for both quark and gluon GPDs):\nF (x, \u2212\u03be, t) = F (x, \u03be, t),\n\n(41)\n\n\u2022 Polynomiality property of GPDs [127] as a consequence of Lorentz invariance:\nZ 1\nn\u22121\nX\nn\u22121 f\ndx x H (x, \u03be, t) =\n(2\u03be)k Afn,k (t) + mod(n \u2212 1, 2)(2\u03be)nCnf (t), (42)\n\u22121\n\nZ\n\nk=0\n\n1\n\ndx xn\u22121 E f (x, \u03be, t) =\n\n\u22121\n\neven\nn\u22121\nX\nk=0\n\nf\n(2\u03be)k Bn,k\n(t) \u2212 mod(n \u2212 1, 2)(2\u03be)nCnf (t). (43)\n\neven\n\nPolynomiality means that the entire \u03be dependence of the n'th x-moment (n > 0)\nof a GPD is given by a polynomial in \u03be of order at most n. Polynomiality is\nsatisfied, e.g., by the representation of GPDs in terms of double distributions (DDs)\nf\nFDD\n(\u03b2, \u03b1, t) [128\u2013130], which can be considered as spectral functions of nonforward\nmatrix elements. In terms of a DD, a generic quark GPD F can always be written\nas:\nZ 1\nZ 1\u2212|\u03b2|\nf\nf\nF (x, \u03be, t) =\nd\u03b2\nd\u03b1 \u03b4(x \u2212 \u03b2 \u2212 \u03be\u03b1) FDD\n(\u03b2, \u03b1, t)\n\u22121\n\n\u22121+|\u03b2|\n\nx\n+ \u03b8(\u03be \u2212 |x|) D f ( , t).\n\u03be\n\n(44)\n\n\fSpin-polarized high-energy scattering of charged leptons on nucleons\n\n55\n\nThe step function \u03b8(\u03b6) is zero for \u03b6 < 0 and unity for \u03b6 > 0. Thus the socalled 'D-term' D f [127] contributes only in the 'ERBL' region \u2212\u03be < x < \u03be,\nwhere quark GPDs have the character of distribution amplitudes for the creation\nof a quark/antiquark pair. It does not contribute in the complementary socalled 'DGLAP' region |x| > \u03be, where quark GPDs describe the emission and\nreabsorption of an (anti-)quark in the infinite momentum frame, thereby having\nproperties analogous to the familiar (anti-)quark distribution functions. The Dterm provides a convenient means of representing this profound difference in GPD\nproperties between the two regions, which would otherwise require singularities in\nthe DD having a severity beyond represention by delta functions or their derivatives.\nAnother perspective is that the maximum power of \u03be provided by the DD itself is\none less than that allowed by Lorentz invariance. Expressions analogous to (44)\ne and E,\ne for which the D-term vanishes. The\nhold for the polarised quark GPDs H\nmapping between GPDs and DDs is not one to one; each GPD can be represented\nby any of an infinite family of DDs. The quantity Cnf (t) in (42,43) is the n'th\nx-moment of D f ( x\u03be , t), which has the same magnitude for the quark GPDs H f and\nE f but enters with the opposite sign. Hence the second moment of the sum of the\nunpolarized quark GPDs H f (x, \u03be, t) + E f (x, \u03be, t) ('Ji integral' (37)) is independent\nof \u03be.\nSeveral sum rules apply at \u03be = 0 and t = 0 [131].

These names are taken from the corresponding\nforward limits given by:\nH f (\u00b1) (x, 0, 0) = qf (x) \u00b1 q\u0304f (x)\ne f (\u00b1) (x, 0, 0) = \u2206qf (x) \u00b1 \u2206q\u0304f (x),\nH\n\n(51)\n(52)\n\nfor x > 0.

Their forward limits involve an additional factor of x, so that (for\nor odd (H\nx > 0):\ne G (x, 0, 0) = x\u2206G(x).\nH G (x, 0, 0) = xG(x),\nH\n(53)\n\n4.3. Impact-parameter-dependent parton distributions\n\nA particularly simple physical interpretation for GPDs can be developed in the limiting\ncase \u03be = 0, where the quark momentum fraction is the same in the initial and final state.\nSo far we have introduced GPDs as momentum-disected form factors. Hence a GPD\nevaluated at a certain value of x can be considered to be the form factor for only those\nquarks in the nucleon that carry momentum fraction x. In analogy with nonrelativistic\nform factors, whose Fourier transform provides information on the charge distribution\nin position space, one would thus expect that the Fourier transform of the t dependence\nof GPDs for fixed x provides information on the position space distribution of quarks\ncarrying a certain momentum fraction x. Indeed, it can be shown that the distribution\nof partons in impact parameter space can be obtained from GPDs via [20]:\nZ 2\nd \u2206\u22a5 \u2212i\u2206\u22a5 *b\u22a5 f\ne\nH (x, 0, \u2212\u22062\u22a5 ),\n(54)\nqf (x, b\u22a5 ) =\n(2\u03c0)2\nwhere \u2212\u22062\u22a5 = t for \u03be = 0. Analogously, the parton helicity distribution in a\ne f . Note\nlongitudinally polarized target is obtained by replacing qf \u2192 \u2206qf and H f \u2192 H\nthat the Heisenberg uncertainty principle forbids a simultaneous exact measurement of\nx and the longitudinal (i.e. along the direction of the virtual photon) position of the\nquarks [22]. Therefore, only the impact parameter b\u22a5 , i.e. the position transverse to the\nnucleon's momentum can be determined simultaneously with x. For the determination\nof the b\u22a5 distribution, the momentum transfer should be purely perpendicular, which\nimplies the restriction to \u03be = 0. The reference point for the impact parameter b\u22a5 is\nthe transverse center of longitudinal momentum R\u22a5 , which plays a role similar to the\ncenter of mass in a nonrelativistic system. In analogy to that case, it is obtained as an\naverage of the positions r\u22a5,i of all the partons, except that the weight factor is not the\nmass fraction, but the momentum fraction xi carried by each parton [132]:\nX\nR\u22a5 =\nxi r\u22a5,i .\n(55)\ni=q,g\n\n\f57\n\nSpin-polarized high-energy scattering of charged leptons on nucleons\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\n8\n6\n4\n\nx\n\n2\n0\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0\n-0.5\n\nb?(fm)\n\n-1\n\nFigure 25. Qualitative shape of q(x, b\u22a5 ).\n\nFor x \u2192 1, the active quark dominates the sum in (55) and q(x, b\u22a5 ) must necessarily\nbecome narrow in this limit (see figure 25).\nIn analogy to the inclusive PDFs that are measured in DIS, given that we have\nrestricted ourselves to \u03be = 0, these Impact-Parameter-Dependent Parton Distributions\n(IPD-PDFs or simply IPDs) have a probabilistic interpretation and hence they satisfy\na variety of inequalities, such as [133, 134]:\nqf (x, b\u22a5 )\n\n\u2265 |\u2206qf (x, b\u22a5 )| \u2265 0 for x > 0,\n\n(56)\n\n\u2212qf (x, b\u22a5 ) \u2265 |\u2206qf (x, b\u22a5 )| \u2265 0 for x < 0.\nRemarkably, (54) is not limited to the nonrelativistic domain of |t| < m2 , in contrast\nto the interpretation of form factors as three-dimensional Fourier transforms of charge\ndistributions. Its only limitation is |t| \u226a Q2 as 1/Q represents the spatial resolution of\nthe virtual photon. Since the electromagnetic form factors are obtained as integrals of\nGPDs (see (32) and (33)), this feature of (54) implies that in the infinite momentum\nframe, the identification of the two-dimensional Fourier transform of form factors with\nthe charge distribution in the transverse plane is also not limited to |t| < m2 .\nFor a longitudinally polarized or unpolarized target, the distribution of quarks in\nthe transverse plane is axially symmetric. However, when the target is transversely\npolarized, the polarization direction of the quark in the transverse plane breaks this\naxial symmetry. For example, for a target polarized in the x\u0302 direction, the quark\ndistribution qf (x, b\u22a5 ) is deformed along the \u0177 direction and the sign and magnitude of\nthis deformation are embodied in the GPD E f (x, 0, \u2212\u22062\u22a5 ) [135]:\nqf (x, b\u22a5 ) =\n\n(57)\n\n\fSpin-polarized high-energy scattering of charged leptons on nucleons\n58\nZ 2\nZ 2\nd \u2206\u22a5 \u2212i\u2206\u22a5 *b\u22a5 f\n1 \u2202\nd \u2206\u22a5 \u2212i\u2206\u22a5 *b\u22a5 f\n2\ne\nH (x, 0, \u2212\u2206\u22a5 ) +\ne\nE (x, 0, \u2212\u22062\u22a5 ).\n2\n(2\u03c0)\n2M \u2202by\n(2\u03c0)2\n\nSuch deformations can be interpreted semi-classically as an enhanced probability of\nphotoabsorption occuring on the left or right of the nucleon as seen by the incident\nphoton, when the nucleon spin is pointing e.g. up. As was explained in section 3.6, this\nsuggests an intimate relationship between these deformations, parton orbital angular\nmomentum, and the Sivers effect.\nExperimentally, only the x-integral of the GPD E f (x, 0, \u2212\u22062\u22a5 ), i.e. the form factor\nF2 (\u2212\u22062\u22a5 ), is known (see (32)). Any additional constraints come only from lattice\ncalculations, which will be discussed in the following section, as well as model studies.\nAs a result, the details of the above deformation are not very well known. In the\nconsidered case of a transversely polarized target, this deformation implies the existence\nof a transverse flavor dipole moment. The integrated deformation can be related modelindependently to the anomalous magnetic moment of the nucleon. For example, when\nthe target is polarized in the x\u0302 (transverse) direction, the average deformation Df of\nthe distribution for quarks of flavor f in the \u0177 direction reads [135]:\nZ 1 Z\n\u03baf /p\n.\n(58)\nDf \u2261\ndx d2 b\u22a5 qf (x, b\u22a5 ) by =\n2M\n\u22121\n\nThe \u03baf /p are the contributions from quark flavor f to the anomalous magnetic moment of\nthe proton with the quark charge factored out: \u03bap = 23 \u03bau/p \u2212 31 \u03bad/p + . . . \u2248 1.79. A flavor\ndecomposition of the anomalous magnetic moment, using \u03ban \u2248 \u22121.91, charge symmetry,\nand neglecting the small contribution from s quarks yields \u03bau/p \u2248 1.67 and \u03bad/p \u2248 \u22122.03,\nwhich translates into average deformations of Du \u2248 +0.16 fm and Dd \u2248 \u22120.20 fm.\nSuch a significant transverse deformation of quark distributions should have\nobservable consequences, e.g. in SIDIS on a transversely polarized target. Armed with\nthe above quantitative information, the semiclassical arguments of section 3.6 about the\ntransverse deformation of PDFs as a cause of single-spin asymmetries can be made more\nspecific. When a virtual photon collides with a proton that has transverse spin down, it\n'sees' more u quarks on the right side of the proton and more d quarks on the left side,\nwith the signs being determined by the signs of \u03baq/p (see figure 15). Since the final-state\ninteraction acting on the escaping quark is on average expected to be attractive, more\nejected u quarks are expected to be deflected to the left than to the right. For d quarks,\nthe opposite is predicted. The predicted negative sign of the Sivers function (22) for\n\u22a5u/p\nu quarks f1T [100], has been confirmed by a recent analysis of SIDIS data for pion\n\u22a5d/p\nproduction on the proton [108, 114, 115]. Here the experimental result for f1T is less\nclear as its contribution to pion production is strongly suppressed. The asymmetry on\nthe deuteron is consistent with zero [136, 137]. A small Sivers asymmetry could arise\nfrom cancellation between the contributions from the proton and neutron. Using charge\n\u22a5u/n\n\u22a5d/p\nsymmetry this implies f1T\n\u2248 \u2212f1T , which is consistent with the prediction based\non the transverse deformation of IPDs. However, it is also possible that at very small\n\u22a5u/p\n\u22a5d/p\nx, both f1T and f1T are small.\n\n\fSpin-polarized high-energy scattering of charged leptons on nucleons\n\n59\n\n4.4. QCD simulations on a space-time lattice\nIdeally, in order to describe properties and interactions of hadrons theoretically, hadronic\nmatrix elements should be evaluated in terms of QCD wave functions. However, this is\nnot possible as long as wave functions in QCD cannot be calculated from first principles.\nQCD calculations on a Euclidean lattice (also known as Lattice QCD or Lattice Gauge\nTheory) are currently the most promising tool to overcome this problem. Presently there\nare a large number of workers active in this field - resulting in many types and flavors\nof lattice QCD. The proceedings of the yearly lattice symposia (currently published in\nPoS) provide a good overview of the state of the field; specifically concerning hadron\nstructure, the two most recent summaries were reported in [138, 139].\nThe inevitable truncations for numerical computations in QCD are less problematic\non a space-time lattice, where space rather than momentum is discretized. After\ndiscretizing space-time on a 4-dimensional grid, approximate solutions for hadron\nmasses and matrix elements are obtained numerically using Monte-Carlo techniques,\nbecause the latter are capable of dealing with the truly astronomical numbers of\ndegrees of freedom (Contemporary lattices typically have about 323 \u00d7 64 discretization\npoints. Including spin and color degrees of freedom, this implies a total of more than\n> 107 degrees of freedom for the entire lattice) that are necessary for an adequate\napproximation to the continuum. These Monte-Carlo techniques are used to evaluate\na so-called 'path integral', which sidesteps a direct computation of wave functions. For\nexample, a pion form factor can be computed without having to know what a pion\nis, only its quantum numbers [140\u2013143]. The evaluation of these path integrals would\nbe impractical working with a real time variable, as amplitudes in quantum mechanics\noscillate as a function of time and would thus lead to poor statistical precision. These\noscillations are avoided by introducing an imaginary time t \u2212\u2192 \u2212i\u03c4 , which renders the\n\u03c4 ime (sic) evolution operator real and positive: exp(\u2212iHt) \u2212\u2192 exp(\u2212H\u03c4 ), and thus\nsuitable for Monte Carlo sampling. The variable \u03c4 is often referred to as 'Euclidean time',\nas the Minkowskian metric becomes Euclidean when expressed in terms of (\u03c4, ~r). This\nlast step requires an analytical continuation to translate the results into a Minkowskian\nspace-time.\nIt is impossible to apply lattice QCD to directly calculate DIS cross sections, since\nthis would require a summation over all possible final states. Instead one can use the\noptical theorem and evaluate the imaginary part of the\nD forward Compton amplitude.\nE\nThis requires the calculation of a correlation function P \u03c8f\u2020 (0)\u03b3 + \u03c8f (z \u2212 ) P between\nnucleon states, where \u03c8f is the quark field operator. Here the light-cone variables are\ndefined as z \u00b1 = \u221a12 (z 0 \u00b1 z 3 ), where the presence of z 0 makes the correlation function\nnon-local in time. Such a space-time structure arises since the Compton amplitude\ninvolves two vertices in figure 23a coupling the nucleon to the virtual photon, separated\nin a light-like direction, as the struck quark moves with nearly the speed of light. This\ncauses additional difficulties in the translation from imaginary \u03c4 ime to real time. This\nproblem restricts lattice gauge theory calculations of PDFs to only their Mellin moments.\n\n\fSpin-polarized high-energy scattering of charged leptons on nucleons\n\n60\n\nSuch moments are accessible because they can be represented by matrix elements of\nlocal (i.e. containing products of field operators and their derivatives evaluated at the\nsame space-time point) operators for which this analytical continuation is trivial. For\nPDFs, which can apparently be parameterized by relatively simple functions, only a\nfew moments may be sufficient to constrain these functions, except very close to the\nendpoints x \u2212\u2192 0, 1. In higher moments the region x \u2212\u2192 0 is suppressed and they thus\nonly indirectly help constrain this region. Even though higher moments emphasize the\nx \u2212\u2192 1 region, PDFs are very small for very large x, and only very high moments yield\nuseful constraints on the x \u2212\u2192 1 behavior of PDFs.\nParameterizing GPDs is significantly more difficult as there are two longitudinal\nvariables instead of one, and the t-dependence adds yet another variable. Furthermore,\nit is not yet known if GPDs can be described by similarly simple functions as PDFs\nand hence it is not obvious how many moments will be needed to generate a reliable\nparameterization for GPDs. Indeed, both phenomenological model calculations (see\nfigure 24) as well as perturbative QCD evolution [144] suggest a 'kink', i.e. a\ndiscontinuous first derivative, for GPDs at x = \u00b1\u03be, whose adequate parameterization\nmay therefore demand a larger number of moments than was the case for PDFs.\nRemarkable progress in lattice calculations has been made over the last three\ndecades. One source of systematic uncertainties is the coarseness (spacing) of the\nlattice. Improved algorithms now permit improved precision at the same lattice spacing\n[145\u2013149]. Another source of uncertainties arises from the finite size of the lattice\n(physical volume). Ideally, it should be large enough to contain the hadron state\ncompletely. Both because improved algorithms allow larger lattice spacings at the same\nprecision and because increased computing power allows more discretization points,\nlarge lattices with several fm diameter are now possible. In the past, the omission\nof sea quarks in 'quenched calculations' gave rise to additional uncertainties. Steady\nincreases in computational resources and improved algorithms make it now possible\nto also include sea quarks ('full' lattice QCD) and unquenched calculations are now\nroutine. Nevertheless, calculating observables that require inserting operators into\ndisconnected quark loops is at present still prohibitively expensive in most cases; some\nexceptions which are tractable have been studied, e.g., in [150]. Usually, contributions\nfrom disconnected diagrams are omitted, resulting in an uncontrolled approximation\nthat affects most flavour-singlet observables. Lattice calculations of flavour non-singlet\nobservables are not affected by this omission and hence are much more reliable. For the\nDirac form factor, the contribution from disconnected quark loops has been estimated to\nbe small [151\u2013154], consistent with the small influence from strange quarks on the charge\nradius of the nucleon [155, 156]. For most other observables, it is not clear whether\nthe disconnected quark loop contribution is small, but steady advances in computer\ntechnology will allow including those contributions in the near future.\nThe masses of light quarks (f = u, d) are of the order of a few MeV. Calculations are\npresently restricted to much higher values, corresponding to pion masses of m\u03c0 \u2248 250\n\n\fSpin-polarized high-energy scattering of charged leptons on nucleons\n\n61\n\nMeV or even higher.\u00b6 This limitation is due not only to the increase of statistical\nfluctuations in the Monte Carlo algorithms for small quark masses but also to the\nincrease in the required overall lattice volume: a proper description of the virtual\npion fluctuations around a hadron demands lattices that are several pion Compton\nwavelengths in diameter. As a result of the restriction to performing calculations in\nan 'unphysical universe' in which the light quarks are too heavy, another significant\nsource of uncertainty arises from the extrapolation to small quark masses and the\ndifficulties involved in restoring the chiral symmetry (17) that was broken by an\nexpedient necessary in discretizing the Dirac equation. Recently, new methods for\napproximating fermion fields on a lattice have been applied which provide significantly\nbetter approximations of chiral symmetry [157\u2013159]. The latter advances now allow\nmore meaningful calculations at smaller quark masses, where chiral symmetry becomes\nincreasingly important. Fortunately, it is not necessary to perform lattice calculations\nat quark masses for u and d quarks of a few MeV. Chiral Perturbation Theory (\u03c7PT) is\nan effective field theory for QCD at small quark masses and momentum transfers. It can\nbe used to extrapolate results from larger quark masses down to these values. However,\na reliable extrapolation first requires lattice simulations for quark masses where \u03c7PT\ncan be trusted, a matter of controversy.\nLattice QCD calculations have now been used to evaluate a large variety of\nobservables, and due to lack of space we present only a few selected cases. Figure\n26 shows lattice results for the nucleon's axial charge gA [160], which is related to the\nspin content of the nucleon by Bjorken's sum rule (8). These results illustrate not only\nthe wide range of quark masses that is now accessible, but also the accuracy that can\nbe achieved when extrapolating results to the physical value m\u03c0 = 139 MeV. For the\ntensor charge one finds after extrapolation to the chiral limit \u03b4u \u2212 \u03b4\u016b = 0.857 \u00b1 0.013\nand \u03b4d \u2212 \u03b4 d \u0304 = 0.212 \u00b1 0.005 [164].\nUsing lattice QCD calculations to determine the second moment of GPDs entering\nthe Ji-relation (37) yields Ju = 0.214 \u00b1 0.027 and Jd = \u22120.001 \u00b1 0.027 [165, 166].\nCombining these results with lattice calculations for \u2206qf + \u2206q\u0304f one thus finds\n\u0001\n1\n\u2206ulatt. + \u2206\u016blatt. = \u22120.195 \u00b1 0.044\n(59)\nLlatt.\n= Julatt. \u2212\nu\n2\n\u0001\n1\n\u2206dlatt. + \u2206d \u0304latt. = 0.200 \u00b1 0.044\n(60)\nLlatt.\n= Jdlatt. \u2212\nd\n2\nat the physical pion mass where the uncertainties are only statistical since some of the\nsystematic uncertainties are difficult to quantify.

However, the isovector combination\nLlatt.\n\u2212 Llatt.\n\u2248 \u22120.4 is not affected by the omission of disconnected quark loops, and\nu\nd\ntherefore more reliable.

Comparison of all presently existing unquenched lattice QCD calculations\nof the nucleon's axial charge gA (LHPC/MILC [160], LHPC/SESAM [161], RBCK\n[162], QCDSF/UKQCD [163]). The solid/dotted line and error band denote a chiral\nperturbation theory fit to the red squares only. The error bars reflect only statistical\nuncertainties and thus the differences between results from different collaborations\ngives an indication of the systematic uncertainty in these calculations. The figure is\ntaken from [160].\n\nmomentum arises from the lower component of a confined relativistic quark wave\nfunction, such as the MIT bag model, u quarks have a positive orbital angular\nmomentum, while for d quarks the orbital angular momentum is negative, yielding\nLu \u2212 Ld > 0. Moreover, the sign of the Sivers function, both in SIDIS and in purely\nhadronic reactions strongly suggests Lu > Ld . QCD evolution of the quark orbital\nangular momentum from very low Q2 , where the quark models are appropriate, to\nthe lattice scale of about 4 GeV2 has been suggested as a possible solution for this\ndiscrepancy [167]. However, in considering this apparent discrepancy, one should bear in\nmind that there are different possibilities for defining what is orbital angular momentum,\nwhich is discussed in detail in section 5.1.\nR\nFigure 27 shows results for the lowest moment dx q(x, b\u22a5 ) of IPDs. The\nmagnitude of the deformation in these panels (i.e. the deviation from axial symmetry)\nis a measure for the correlation between the nucleon spin and the quark orbital angular\nmomentum (left) and between the quark spin and quark orbital angular momentum\n(right).

Applying the chromodynamic lensing mechanism (section\n\u22a5q\n4.3), this is consistent with opposite sign Sivers functions f1T\n(see section 3.6) for u and\nd quarks. Using the same reasoning for transversely polarized quarks in an unpolarized\ntarget, this leads to same-sign Boer-Mulders functions h\u22a5q\n1 (see section 3.7) and the sign\nis the same as the sign of the Sivers function for u quarks (negative). The correlations\n\u22a5q\n> f1T\non the right also appear somewhat stronger than on the left, suggesting h\u22a5q\n.\n1\nLattice QCD calculations play an important role in complementing both\nexperiments and phenomenological models. For selected hadron structure observables,\nlattice calculations are reaching a precision that will allow the comparison of\nQCD predictions to experimental data.\nLattice calculations also complement\nexperiments because there are many interesting observables which are difficult to probe\nexperimentally, but which are easily accessible on a lattice. Examples include most\n\n\fSpin-polarized high-energy scattering of charged leptons on nucleons\n\n64\n\nchirally odd distribution functions and form factors. Nevertheless, calculations on the\nlattice will never be able to fully replace experiments in the exploration of hadron\nstructure. For example, no local manifestly gauge invariant operator + exists for \u2206G,\nwhich is therefore inaccessible in lattice QCD calculations. Simulation of scattering\nreactions and investigation of unstable particles is enormously difficult. Already the\ndetermination of low energy scattering phase shifts requires a sequence of calculations\non lattices of various volumes [169\u2013171], thus multiplying the computational time. Only\nthose resonances (unstable particles) the mass of which is close to their decay threshold\nare accessible by this technique. Furthermore, the necessary use of Euclidean \u03c4 ime in\nlattice calculations makes those observables inaccessible that require calculations with a\nreal time variable. For those high-energy scattering processes where initial and/or final\nstate interactions are essential, such as SIDIS, no useful algorithm has been developed\nyet and the interpretation of experiments still has to rely on phenomenological models.\nEven after factorization has been applied in SIDIS, calculating the final-state interaction\nphase that is crucial for TMDs would again require a real time variable. This is the\nmain reason why no one has found a direct way for calculating the Sivers (22) or BoerMulders (24) functions on the lattice. However, ISI/FSI affect the pT dependence of all\nPDFs and since the lattice presently can only calculate intrinsic distributions (without\nISI/FSI) a direct comparison to experimentally measured pT -dependent distributions\n(which include ISI/FSI) thus requires modeling of those effects. Likewise, no algorithm\nexists for calculating fragmentation functions on the lattice.\nAs a result of these limitations, there has also been a significant synergy between\nlattice calculations and phenomenological models in recent years. Even though lattice\ncalculations cannot be used for direct calculations in dynamical processes, they can\nplay a useful role in providing phenomenological models with input parameters, thus\neffectively increasing the predictive power of these models. The above-mentioned\npredictions for the Boer-Mulders functions is an excellent example for such a synergy\nbetween lattice and phenomenology: in the 'chromodynamic lensing' model for SSAs\npresented in section 4.3, IPDs are needed as input. For the Boer-Mulders functions, the\nrelevant GPDs are chirally odd and no experimental constraints on them exist, but the\nlattice calculations of these GPDs [168] leading to the deformations shown in figure 27\nallowed predictions to be made for the signs of the Boer-Mulders functions for u and d\nquarks [126, 172].\n4.5. Access to quark GPDs through exclusive lepton-nucleon scattering\nPresently the experimentally most accessible GPDs are the chirally-even quark GPDs\ne E, E\ne and f = u, d). In order to constrain their non-forward\nF f (x, \u03be, t) (F = H, H,\n(\u03be 6= 0) behaviour, measurements can be performed of hard exclusive leptoproduction\nof a photon or meson, leaving the target nucleon intact. Useful observables are cross\n+\n\nAn operator that can be written as the same expression in all gauges is called manifestly gauge\ninvariant.\n\n\f65\n\nSpin-polarized high-energy scattering of charged leptons on nucleons\n\nsections and cross section differences or asymmetries with respect to the polarization\nof the beam or target, or the beam charge. In these observables, GPDs typically\nappear convoluted with hard scattering amplitudes, so that they cannot be extracted\ndirectly from the measured data. Instead, their functional dependence on x, \u03be, and t is\nparameterized in theoretical models (see section 4.6), the parameters of which have to\nbe constrained by comparison to experiment (see section 4.7). For various final states,\nthe convolution integrals appear combined additively or multiplicatively in various ways,\nwith various kinematic prefactors. Hence eventually the extraction of quark GPDs will\nrequire a (presently not yet existing) global fit to data from various experiments, as has\nbeen customary for decades in the extraction of ordinary PDFs.\n4.5.1. Deeply virtual Compton scattering The exploitation of exclusive production of a\nreal photon, i.e., Deeply Virtual Compton Scattering e p \u2192 e p \u03b3, has two advantages:\ni) among the hard exclusive processes that can be accessed experimentally in the\nforeseeable future, it is considered to be the one with the most reliable theoretical\ninterpretation\nii) effects of next-to-leading order [173\u2013175] and sub-leading twist (see section 1)\ncorrections [176\u2013178] are under theoretical control. For suitably chosen observables\nthe lowest correction is of order 1/Q2 instead of 1/Q.\nIn the generalized Bjorken limit of large photon virtuality Q2 at fixed xB and t,\nthe dominant pQCD subprocess of DVCS is described by the 'handbag' diagram shown\nxB\nin this\nin the left panel of figure 28.

The pure DVCS contribution, |\u03c4DV CS |2 , can then be extracted\nby integrating over the azimuthal dependence of the cross section. In this situation the\ninterference term I vanishes to leading order in 1/Q; its total contribution at collider\nkinematics was estimated to be at the percent level [178].\n\n\u03b3 - \u03b3 - p plane\n*\n\ny\n/\n\n\u03c6\n\n\u03b3\n\nl\n\nx\n\n\u0398\u03b3*\u03b3\n\u03b3\n\n*\n\nz\np\n\nl\n/\n\nl - l plane\n\nFigure 29. Definition of the azimuthal angle \u03c6 in DVCS in the target rest frame.\n\nThe interference term I is of high interest, as the measurement of its azimuthal\ndependence opens experimental access to the complex-valued DVCS process amplitude.\nIn this way, both their real and imaginary parts (magnitude and phase) become\naccessible [180]. This method to study DVCS can be compared to holography [181]\nin the sense that the phase of the process amplitude of DVCS is measured against\nthe known 'reference phase' of the BH process. Moreover, at fixed-target energies, the\nmore abundant BH process can be considered as an 'amplifier' to study the rare DVCS\nprocess.\n\n\fSpin-polarized high-energy scattering of charged leptons on nucleons\n\n67\n\nAn expansion in 1/Q of the electroproduction cross section (61) reveals distinctive\nkinematic signatures of DVCS [178, 180, 182]. For the interference term I this expansion\nreads:\n\"\n#\nX\nX\ncn cos n\u03c6 + Pbeam\ncn sin n\u03c6 + O(1/Q) , (62)\nI \u221d el\nknc ReM\nkns ImM\nn=1,3\n\nn=1,2\n\nwhere el = \u00b11 is the charge of the lepton beam and the knc,s are kinematic factors.\ncn represent linear combinations of helicity (Compton) amplitudes describing the\nThe M\n\nDVCS process. The subscript n = 1, 2, 3 labels the helicities for initial and final state\nphotons: n = 1 (++) means helicity conservation, n = 2 (+0) single-helicity flip and\nn = 3 (+\u2212) double-helicity flip.\nIn general, the portion of the interference term containing real parts of Compton\namplitudes can be isolated by forming a cross section difference or asymmetry with\nrespect to the charge of the lepton beam [183], while that containing imaginary parts\ncan be accessed by forming single-spin differences or asymmetries with respect to the\npolarization of the lepton beam [184] or of the target [131, 178]. In the interpretation\nof experimental results in the subsequent sections, always only the helicity-conserving\nc1 \u2261 M\nc++ is considered. In the convention of Ref.

A CFF\nF satisfies a single-variable dispersion relation showing that the entire \u03be dependence\nof the real part is given by aterm that can be constructed from only the imaginary\npart [185\u2013187]:\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ 1\n1\n1\n1\n\u2032\n\u2032\n+ CF (t).\n(69)\n\u2213\nd\u03be Im F (\u03be , t)\nRe F (\u03be, t) = P\n\u03c0\n\u03be \u2212 \u03be\u2032 \u03be + \u03be\u2032\n0\nAt leading order, the imaginary part depends only on the GPDs on the trajectories\nx = \u00b1\u03be. The D-term form factor is then given by:\n\u0012\n\u0013\nX Z 1\n1\n2\nf\nef\ndx D (x, t)\n,\n(70)\nCF (t) =\n1\n\u2212\nx\n0\nf\n\nwhere the D-term D f was introduced in (44) of section 4.2. This form factor vanishes\ne and Ee and is identical up to the sign for H and E [186, 187]. Equation\nfor the CFFs H\n(69) together with (68) imply that at leading order and without considering effects of\nevolution, the real part of the CFF can be decomposed into a term that shares the\nwell-known property of the imaginary part in depending on the value of the GPDs only\nalong the one-dimensional trajectories x = \u00b1\u03be, and another term that depends only on\nt and Q2 , and not on \u03be. Thus, in a leading-order analysis of DVCS data, parametric\nmodels for quark GPDs can be constrained only in the subspace (x = \u00b1\u03be, t). Beyond\nthis scenario, a full (x, \u03be) mapping of quark GPDs is still possible, at least in principle:\ni) when a large enough range in Q2 is covered by DVCS measurements, the known\nQ2 -evolution of quark GPDs can be used to constrain their x-dependence.\nii) in hard exclusive leptoproduction of a virtual photon (double DVCS or DDVCS), its\nvirtuality, i.e. the invariant mass of the produced lepton pair, is an additional variable\nthat facilitates a complete mapping of quark GPDs [188, 189]. However, the DDVCS\ncross section is suppressed by an additional factor \u03b1em , thereby making this reaction\npractically inaccessible using present facilities.\n\n\fSpin-polarized high-energy scattering of charged leptons on nucleons\n\n69\n\nEven if complete DVCS data sets were available for both proton and neutron targets,\nit would still be a very intricate theoretical problem to deconvolute the quark GPDs F f\nfrom the CFF F . The variable t does not pose any problem as it does not appear in\nthe kernel; i.e., the deconvolution would have to be done at a given value of t.\n4.5.2. Hard exclusive meson production Additional information on GPDs is available\nfrom hard exclusive lepto-production of a pseudoscalar or vector meson M: e p \u2192 e p M.\nTo leading order in 1/Q and \u03b1s , the meson structure itself enters only through a few\nconstants [131]. (In higher order the meson distribution amplitude has to be explicitly\ntaken into account.) The meson production cross section receives contributions from\nboth longitudinal (L) and transverse (T) virtual photons:\nX\nX\nd\u03c3\n2\n\u221d\n|A\n|\n+\n\u01eb\n|AL |2 ,\n(71)\nT\ndxB dQ2 d|t|\nspins\nspins\n\nwhere \u01eb is the ratio of longitudinal and transverse fluxes of the virtual photon. The\ndependences of the scattering amplitudes A on the hadron polarizations is summed or\nP\naveraged over in spins . A factorization theorem has been proved to date only for the\nlongitudinal part [190].\nThe contribution by transverse photons to the cross section for meson production\nappears at subleading order in 1/Q [131, 190]. In case of production of a vector meson\nits spin-density matrix can be measured, thus facilitating the longitudinal-transverse\nseparation. In case of pseudoscalar meson production only data at sufficiently large Q2\nmay be used where the contribution of transverse virtual photons can be neglected.\nIt appears that for meson production by longitudinal photons, at leading order in\n1/Q and for an unpolarized target [131,190], only one pair of quark GPDs is involved in\nthe relevant combination, controlled by the type of spin-parity exchange in the meson\nproduction, so that by measuring various meson types different pairs of quark GPDs are\nfiltered out. For natural-parity exchange, i.e. for the production of e.g. vector mesons\nsuch as \u03c10 , the quark-helicity-conserving GPDs H f and E f are involved:\nt\n1X\n|AL |2 = (1 \u2212 \u03be 2 )|H|2 \u2212 (\u03be 2 +\n)|E|2 \u2212 2\u03be 2 Re(E \u2217 H).\n(72)\n2 spins\n4m2\nFor unnatural-parity exchange, i.e. for the production of e.g. pseudoscalar mesons such\ne f and E\nef are involved:\nas pions, the quark-helicity-flip GPDs H\n1X e 2\ne 2 \u2212 \u03be 2 t |E|\ne 2 \u2212 2\u03be 2Re(Ee\u2217 H).\ne\n|AL | = (1 \u2212 \u03be 2 )|H|\n(73)\n2 \u2032\n4m2\n\u03bb\u03bb\n\nRecently, detailed numerical studies were presented of the perturbative convergence\nof the longitudinal cross section for the production of \u03c10 , \u03c9, \u03c6 and \u03c0 + mesons [191]. At\nintermediate to large xB , typical for fixed-target experiments, NLO corrections of up to\n100% were found, which somewhat decrease in size when going from Q2 = 4 GeV2 to\n9 GeV2 . At lower xB , typical for collider kinematics, NLO corrections are huge even\nfor Q2 well above 10 GeV2 . Such an increased sensitivity to higher-order corrections is\n\n\fSpin-polarized high-energy scattering of charged leptons on nucleons\n\n70\n\ndue to the above shown quadratic dependence on GPDs. It also exists in DVCS (see\n(61)) for the |\u03c4DV CS |2 term, but not for the interference term I. We note that huge NLO\ncorrections up to 200-300% appear also in other, mainly collider processes. Here in most\ncases the full NLO result is available and used, and typically the NNLO corrections are\nnot again 100% of the NLO ones.\n4.6. GPD parameterizations\nThe application of the Ji relation (37) to evaluate the total angular momentum of\nquarks of flavour f is a challenging task as it requires, at some fixed common value\nof \u03be, knowledge of both H f and E f over the entire x range in the limit of small t.\nIn section 4.5.1, it was explained that the best presently practical probe to constrain\nquark GPDs is DVCS, which unfortunately does not directly provide all of the required\ninformation because of its kinematic limitations. While H f (x, 0, 0) = qf (x) is well\nknown, E f (x, \u03be, 0) is poorly constrained at \u03be = 0, because there it has no influence\non experimental observables aside from its first moment, i.e. the Pauli form factor.\nHence the Ji relation must be evaluated in the nonforward regime. Furthermore,\nthe integral (37) must be evaluated in the limit t \u2192 0, even though the crucial\ndependences of DVCS cross sections on beam charge and polarisations of the beam\nand target disappear in this limit. Thus GPD parameterizations constrained by DVCS\ndata must be used to extrapolate as t \u2192 0, which might seem to introduce some\ndegree of arbitrariness. However, GPDs are far from arbitrary functions of the three\nvariables x, \u03be, t (or four, when including Q2 ), as they must satisfy several relations as\ndescribed in section 4.2. Considerable ingenuity is therefore required in finding analytic\nrepresentations or phenomenological parameterizations of quark GPDs that embody the\nconstraints of various symmetries and principles, while conveniently parameterizing the\nremaining degrees of freedom. The discussion of dynamical models, a recent review of\nwhich is given in [192], is beyond the scope of this paper.\nThe simplest ansatz that one might consider for the t dependence of quark GPDs\nis a 'factorized' form:\nH f (x, \u03be, t) = hf (x, \u03be) F1f (t).\n\n(74)\n\nHowever, there is evidence from phenomenological considerations [125, 193, 194] and\nlattice QCD calculations [165, 168] that the t dependence is entangled with both x and\n\u03be, so that factorized ans\u00e4tze are disfavoured. As discussed in section 4.3, t is conjugate to\nthe impact parameter b\u22a5 , so that this entanglement corresponds to the interplay between\nlongitudinal and transverse degrees of freedom in the nucleon, sometimes called 'nucleon\ntomography'. Measured electromagnetic form factors together with some physically\nmotivated functional forms for the limits x \u2192 0, 1 have provided some information\nabout the entanglement of x and t for 'valence' quark flavours in the limited regime\n\u03be = 0 [193]. In this work, an exponential ansatz was chosen for this entanglement in\nthe valence GPDs:\nH f (\u2212) (x, 0, t) = qf v (x) exp [tff (x)]\n\n(75)\n\n\fSpin-polarized high-energy scattering of charged leptons on nucleons\n\n71\n\nb\nx\n\nb\n1\u2212x\nFigure 30.

The figure is taken from [193].\n\nwhere the unpolarized valence PDF qf v (x) \u2261 qf (x) \u2212 q\u0304f (x) is known. Although the\ndependence on Q2 has been suppressed here for convenience, this exponential form is\napproximately stable under QCD evolution, more so at small x. It corresponds to\nan IPDPDF with guaranteed positivity and a plausible Gaussian shape with an xdependent width:\n\u0015\n\u0014\nb2\u22a5\n1 qf v (x)\n,\nhb2\u22a5 i = 4ff (x) . (76)\nexp \u2212\nqf v (x, b\u22a5 ) =\n4\u03c0 ff (x)\n4ff (x)\n\nThe choice for the function ff (x) is motivated by simple physical ideas. Partons with\nsmall x can be considered to arise from a cascade of branching processes, sometimes\ncalled 'Gribov diffusion' [195]. This sort of random walk corresponds to the mean-square\nimpact parameter hb2\u22a5 i growing at small x as log(1/x), a behavior that is provided by\nthe 'Regge-motivated' form\n\u0012 \u0013\u03b1\u2032 t\n1\n\u2032\nf (\u2212)\n(B0 /2)t\nH\n(x, 0, t) \u221d e\n* qf v (x) = e\u03b1 t log(1/x)+(B0 /2)t qf v (x) .\n(77)\nx\n\nThe choice for the function ff (x) is also influenced by plausible expectations for the\nopposite situation with x approaching unity. As was mentioned in section 4.3, a struck\nquark with large x is expected to have a small impact parameter b\u22a5 with respect to\nthe nucleon centre of momentum given by (55). With the center of momentum of the\nspectator collection given by \u2212b\u22a5 x/(1 \u2212 x), the separation b\u22a5 /(1 \u2212 x) between quark\nand spectators can be interpreted as a lower limit on the transverse size of the nucleon,\nas illustrated in figure 30. If the size of this confined system is not to diverge as x \u2192 1,\nthen hb2\u22a5 i must vanish at least as rapidly as (1 \u2212 x)2 [133, 196]. This implies that\nff (x) \u2192 Af (1 \u2212 x)n as x \u2192 1, with n \u2265 2. With n = 2, this as well as the above\nconstraint for small x are respectively satisfied by the third and first terms in the form\n1\n(78)\nff (x) = \u03b1\u2032 (1 \u2212 x)3 log + Bf (1 \u2212 x)3 + Af x(1 \u2212 x)2 ,\nx\nwhere the second term provides a smooth interpolation between them, and \u03b1\u2032 , Af and\nBf are free parameters to be fitted.

The figure is taken from [193].\n\ngood fit is obtained of existing data for both Dirac and Pauli elastic form factors of the\nnucleon. For x < 0.8, H u(\u2212) (x, 0, t) is well determined, thereby determining the mean\nsquare impact parameter b\u22a5 of u quarks as a function of x in this range. As illustrated\nin figure 31, there are clear indications that the transverse distribution of d quarks is\nbroader than that of u quarks at large x. While the fits for E f (\u2212) (x, 0, t) are ambiguous\ndue to the unknown forward distributions, their second x-moments appearing in the Ji\nrelation (37) are reasonably well determined within the context of the assumed ansatz.\nIt is found that the contributions of the orbital angular momenta of u and d valence\nquarks to the nucleon spin almost cancel, leaving a small net contribution. In summary,\na remarkable amount of information about 'nucleon tomography' was gleaned from only\ndata for nucleon elastic form factors.\nIn the following, two specific parametric models for quark GPDs that have been\nmost frequently used (in several variants) for comparisons to DVCS data are briefly\ndescribed as examples. Both are based on quark GPD parameterizations that might\nin principle be employed at any order in \u03b1s , while the phenomenology has been done\nat only leading order. The remainder of this section has limited goals as a reference\ntool for continuing students of the field, and might be omitted on a first reading. The\nfirst example, the 'VGG-model' [125, 198], is based on an ansatz that factorizes the\ndependences on \u03be and t in the framework of double distributions including the earlier\nmentioned D-term (see section 4.2). Here the flavour dependence of the D-term is taken\nfrom the chiral quark soliton model [199], resulting in a somewhat modified expression\nfor a generic unpolarised quark GPD F (F = H, E):\nZ 1\nZ 1\u2212|\u03b2|\nx\n1\nf\nf\n\u03b8(\u03be \u2212 |x|) D( , t),(79)\nF (x, \u03be, t) =\nd\u03b2\nd\u03b1 \u03b4(x \u2212 \u03b2 \u2212 \u03be\u03b1) FDD\n(\u03b2, \u03b1, t) \u00b1\nNf\n\u03be\n\u22121\n\u22121+|\u03b2|\n\n\fSpin-polarized high-energy scattering of charged leptons on nucleons\n\n73\n\nwhere the upper (lower) sign applies for the GPD H (E). The model ansatz proposed\nin [200] is invoked to write the DD in (79) as a product\nf\nf\nFDD\n(\u03b2, \u03b1, t) = h(b) (\u03b2, \u03b1) Fforw\n(\u03b2, 0, t)\n\n(80)\n\nf\nof a 'forward' (\u03be-independent) quark GPD Fforw\n(\u03b2, 0, t) with a 'profile function'\n\n[1 \u2212 |\u03b2|2 \u2212 \u03b12 ]\nh (\u03b2, \u03b1) \u221d\n(1 \u2212 |\u03b2|)2b+1\n(b)\n\nb\n\n(81)\n\nthat controls the skewness dependence through the (free) profile parameter b, with\nf\ne f (x, 0, t),\nb \u2192 \u221e approaching the forward limits (51) and (52) for HDD\n(x, 0, t) and H\nDD\nrespectively. Often profile parameters are chosen separately for valence and sea quarks.\nWe note that for b \u2192 \u221e this ansatz for FDD (x, \u03be, t) is singular at x = 0 for finite \u03be, which\nis physically implausible. While the clear advantage of the ansatz (80,81) is its simplicity,\nit is considered to be too restrictive for flexible modelling of the (\u03be, t) dependence of\nquark GPDs [201, 202], especially at small values of \u03be. The (x, t) dependence is based\non either a factorized or the above-mentioned Regge-inspired ansatz.\nef is evaluated from the 'pion pole', which is an ansatz based on\nThe quark GPD E\nthe assumption that the dominant contribution at small |t| arises from the emission of\na virtual pion by the target nucleon [203, 204], which for small |t| is not far off-shell\nbecause of the small mass of the pion. The 'pole' in the pion-exchange t dependence\n1/(m2\u03c0 \u2212 t) appears in the unphysical region at t = m2\u03c0 . This ansatz contributes to only\nthe real part and only in the ERBL kinematic region. Also the pion quantum numbers\ne u\u2212d and\nlimit this contribution to only the C-even part of the isovector combination E\nto the corresponding proton-neutron transition GPDs. For the unknown forward (spinflip) PDF of the GPD E f , a parametric combination of valence and sea quark 'PDFs' is\nused with a functional form inspired by results obtained in [125] using the chiral quark\nsoliton model [205]. In this parametric combination, the quark total angular momenta\nJf of quarks and antiquarks of flavour f (f = u, d) enter as model parameters, so that\nthe derivation of model-dependent constraints on Jf becomes possible by comparing\npredictions to experimental data, as described in section 4.7.6. The VGG model, after its\nimplementation in the 'VGG code' [198], was widely compared to polarised cross sections\nand asymmetries in beam spin and charge at fixed-target energies and found to describe\nessential features of the data, especially when using the Regge-inspired ansatz for the\n(x, t) dependence. (see section 4.7.2). As this model inherited the above mentioned\nlimitations of the adopted DD ansatz, it cannot describe unpolarized cross sections\nat collider energies where the skewness is small. It was not studied how seriously its\nlimitations may affect the various interpretations of experimental data in terms of this\nmodel. For a similar model [178], the effects of NLO corrections to the quark CFFs\nwere found to be significant but moderate, so that they need to be included when\nextracting model parameters from precise data, while LO calculations were considered\nto be sufficient for the purpose of estimating observables.\nThe so-called 'dual-parameterization' model, presented as the second example, is\nbased on the idea of duality in soft hadron-hadron interactions, which is the assumption\n\n\fSpin-polarized high-energy scattering of charged leptons on nucleons\n\n74\n\nthat the 2 \u2192 2 scattering amplitude in the s-channel can be represented as an infinite\nsum of t-channel exchanges [206]. In the case of quark GPDs, this idea is implemented\nin the form of a t-channel partial wave expansion of the Mellin moments [207]. In\naddition, by using Gegenbauer moments instead of Mellin moments, one can diagonalize\nthe leading-order QCD evolution kernel, which is a major advantage of this approach.\nAfter resumming the partial wave expansion for the Gegenbauer moments, one arrives\nat an expansion for a quark GPD F f in which each subsequent term is suppressed by\ntwo powers of the skewness parameter \u03be:\nF f (x, \u03be, t) = K0 Qf0 (x, t) + \u03be 2 K2 Qf2 (x, t) + \u03be 4 K4 Qf4 (x, t) + . . .\n\n(82)\n\nHere the Kk represent parameter-free \u03be-dependent (but t-independent) integral\ntransformations acting on the variable x. The functions Qfk (x, t) are called 'forward-like'\nfunctions as their LO evolution is governed by the DGLAP evolution equations, just as\nfor PDFs. The parameters of the model appear in these functions. In the (t-dependent)\n'forward' limit \u03be = 0, (82) simplifies to only the first term and the K0 becomes simple\nenough to invert. In the case of the quark GPD H f , the functions Qf0 (x, t) can thus be\nrelated to qf (x, t) \u2261 H f (+) (x, 0, t):\nZ\nx 1 d\u03b6\nf\n(qf (\u03b6, t) + q\u0304f (\u03b6, t)),\n(83)\nQ0 (x, t) = (qf (x, t) + q\u0304f (x, t)) \u2212\n2 x \u03b62\n\nand Qf0 (x, 0) is thus constrained in terms of the PDFs. An analogous expression holds\nfor the GPDs E f (+) (x, \u03be, t) with (t-dependent) 'forward' distributions ef (x, t). The\nexpansion in (82) is introduced in such a way that as k increases their terms are\nincreasingly suppressed for small skewness \u03be and fixed x. It remains to be shown that\nthis expansion in \u03be gives a good approximation for fixed x/\u03be when truncated at finite\nk [208].\nThe leading-order DVCS amplitude relates to quark GPDs through the convolution\nintegral:\n\u0015\n\u0014\nZ 1\n1\n1\nLO\nf\nf (+)\n.\n(84)\n+\nA (\u03be, t) =\ndx F\n(x, \u03be, t)\nx \u2212 \u03be + i0 x + \u03be \u2212 i0\n0\nAnother major advantage of the dual parameterization is that this singular integration\ncan be performed analytically in terms of the Qfk [201]:\nZ 1\n1\ndx f\nLO\nf\nN (x, t) q\n,\n(85)\nIm A (\u03be, t) = \u2212 2\n2x\nx\n2 \u22121\nx\u0304\n\u2212\nx\n\u03be\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\nZ x\u0304\n1\n1\n2 \uf8fb\ndx f\nLO\nq\nq\nN (x, t) \uf8f0\nRe Af (\u03be, t) = \u2212 2\n+\n\u2212\n2\nx\n0\n+ x2 1 + 2x\n+ x2 1 + x\n1 \u2212 2x\n\u03be\n\u03be\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\nZ 1\ndx f\n2 \uf8fb\n1\nq\n\u22122\n\u2212\nN (x, t) \uf8f0\n\u2212 4D f (t),\n(86)\n2\n2x\nx\n1\n+\nx\n2\nx\u0304\n1+\n+x\n\u03be\n\n\fSpin-polarized high-energy scattering of charged leptons on nucleons\n75\n\u221a\nP\u221e k f\n1\u2212 1\u2212\u03be 2\nf\nf\n,\nN\n(x,\nt)\n\u2261\nwhere x\u0304 =\nk=0 x Qk (x, t) and D (t) is the D-term form factor.\n\u03be\nThe integral transform in (85) can be inverted analytically, yielding\n\u0015\n\u0014\nZ 1\nd\u03be\nd\n1\n1 x(1 \u2212 x2 )\n1\nf\nf\nf\n\u221a\nImA (\u03be, t) \u2212 \u03be ImA (\u03be, t) , (87)\nN (x, t) =\n\u03c0 (1 + x2 )3/2 x0 \u03be 3/2 \u03be \u2212 x0 2\nd\u03be\n2x\nwith x0 = 1+x\n2 . This result can be summarized in the following statements that all hold\nto leading order only:\n\n\u2022 The imaginary part of the DVCS amplitude alone (but for all \u03be) is sufficient to\ndetermine N f (x, t). If data are available only above a certain value of \u03be, one can\nstill reconstruct N f (x, t) above a certain value of x. In principle, i.e. given ideal\ndata (negligible uncertainties), this reconstruction can be done exactly.\n\u2022 Upon inserting N f (x, t) from (87) into (86), data for the real part of the Compton\namplitude can be used to determine the D-term form factor. Given ideal data with\nfull coverage in \u03be, the only new information contained in Re Af (\u03be, t) that was not\nalready contained in Im Af (\u03be, t) is the D-term form factor. Of course, as ideal data\nare unfortunately unavailable, (86) also provides useful constraints on N f (x, t) as\nthe D-term form factor does not depend on \u03be.\n\u2022 At fixed Q2 , N f (x, t) and the D-term form factor constitute the only information\nabout quark GPDs that can be obtained from DVCS. However, QCD evolution can\nbe a viable tool for the extraction of quark GPDs, as the LO evolution of the Qf2k is\nknown to be governed by the LO DGLAP evolution equations. Since the Qf2k (x, t)\nenter N f (x, t) multiplied by x2k , the n'th Mellin moment of N f (x, t) will depend\non the (n + 2k)'th Mellin moment of the Qf2k . Since the anomalous dimensions\nthat govern the LO evolution depend on the order of the moment (and only on\nthe order), this implies that at different Q2 the Mellin moments of Qf2k (at some\nrenormalization scale Q20 ) enter N f (x, t) with different relative weights. At least\nin principle, DVCS data taken at a set of different values of Q2 thus provide a\nsystem of linear equations for the Mellin moments of the Qf2k that (after suitable\ntruncation) can be solved, which in turn can be used to reconstruct the quark GPD.\nUnfortunately, not only is there a lack of ideal data that are required for the above\nprocedure to work, but also LO evolution is likely to be insufficient at presently accessible\nvalues of Q2 . An approach that is closely related to [201] is that of [209,210], which uses\nconformal symmetry to diagonalize the evolution up to NLO and may thus overcome\nthe above discussed limitations of the LO treatment.\nThe dual parameterization does not model the t dependence of the GPDs, which\nmust be specified separately. Present applications of the model do not include the\ne and E\ne f nor higher-twist contributions. The model is worked out only\nquark GPDs H\nto leading-order accuracy, as only then the DVCS amplitude has a simple form in terms\nof the Qfk (t), and also their evolution can be handled easily. The generalization from\nLO to NLO is far from obvious. On the other hand, an advantage of this approach\nis the clear separation of the (\u03be-independent) 'forward' distributions qf (x, t) [ef (x, t)]\n\n\fSpin-polarized high-energy scattering of charged leptons on nucleons\n\n76\n\nof the quark GPDs H f (x, \u03be, t) [E f (x, \u03be, t)] from genuine non-forward effects encoded\nin the distribution of strength among the functions Qf2 , Qf4 , . . . in (82). Restricting\noneself to the two lowest functions (k = 0, 2) yields the so-called 'minimal version' of\nthe model [207].\nAlso assuming in this 'minimal version' Qf2 (x, 0) \u221d Qf0 (x, 0), it was initially found\nthat the Q2 and W dependences of the low-x HERA collider data were fairly well\ndescribed [211], until a missing factor was noticed, leading to a cross section magnitude\ndiscrepancy of about a factor of four [212]. In [213], calculations in the minimal version\nusing only the lowest function Qf0 (called 'zero-step' approach) as well as calculations of\nthe VGG model were recently compared to JLab data on cross sections and asymmetries\n(see section 4.7.3, e.g. figure 39). These comparisons are unaffected by that missing\nfactor.\nNo global fits to all existing DVCS data yet exist. Future algorithms must\nnecessarily include enough orders beyond LO to ensure convergence. The only existing\napproach fulfilling this requirement is a recently developed formalism [186] based on\ndispersion relations discussed in section 4.5.1. In this new formalism, dispersion relation\nand operator expansion techniques are combined leading to convergence of the conformal\npartial wave expansion of the VCS amplitude. This formalism was successfully applied\nto fit DVCS observables in NNLO at low xB [186], as described in section 4.7.1. In a\nfirst attempt, this fit was very recently extended to include also data from fixed-target\nexperiments [214].\n4.7. DVCS experimental results\n4.7.1. DVCS cross section at high energies The DVCS cross section (61) integrated\nover its azimuthal dependence has been measured in hard exclusive electroproduction\nof photons by the experiments H1 and Zeus at the Hera collider. For the xB range\naccessible at collider kinematics (O(10\u22122 . . . 10\u22124 )), two-gluon exchange plays a major\nrole besides the quark-exchange handbag diagram of figure 28, so that both gluon and\nquark GPDs are probed simultaneously. This is however limited to small skewness\nvalues below 10\u22122 .\nThe analysis method used by the two experiments is similar due to their similar\ngeometries. As the outgoing proton remains undetected in the beam pipe, the event\ntopology is defined by two electromagnetic clusters, the outgoing lepton and the\nproduced real photon, at most one of which is associated with a charged track. Two\nevents samples are selected:\ni) in the 'DVCS-enriched' sample an energetic photon is required. With respect to\nthe incoming lepton it is required to be detected at a large scattering angle while the\noutgoing lepton is measured at a small angle. Still, a high enough virtuality Q2 > 4 GeV2\nis ensured by requiring a large energy of the scattered lepton (> 15 GeV).\nii) in the Bethe-Heitler dominated 'reference sample', the radiatively produced photon\nis emitted at a small angle with respect to the incoming lepton, and the outgoing lepton\n\n\f77\n\nSpin-polarized high-energy scattering of charged leptons on nucleons\n\n-\n\nH1\n\nH1 HERA II e p\nH1 HERA I\nZEUS HERA I\n\n10\n\n\u03c3DVCS [nb]\n\n\u03c3DVCS [nb]\n\nat a large angle.\nA Monte Carlo simulation of the completely known BH process, validated by the\nreference sample, is used to subtract the BH contribution from the DVCS-enriched\nsample.

The figure is taken from [215].\n\nA commonly used ansatz for the t dependence of quark GPDs is an exponential\ndecrease e\u2212b |t| . The slope parameter b was first measured in DVCS by H1 [215], the\nresults being shown in the two left panels of figure 34 for hQ2 i = 8, 15.5 and 25\nGeV2 integrated over W , and for hW i = 40, 70 and 100 GeV integrated over Q2 .\nParameterizing a possible Q2 dependence as b(Q2 ) = A (1 \u2212 B * log(Q2 /2 GeV2 )), the\nfit shows that it is indeed significant with A = 6.98 \u00b1 0.54 Gev2 and B = 0.12 \u00b1 0.03.\nAt Q2 = 8 GeV2 the result is b = 5.45 \u00b1 0.19stat \u00b1 0.34syst . Following [135, 221], this t\nslope can be converted to an average impact parameter which describes the transverse\nextension of partons.\nThe H1 result at hxi = 1.2 * 10\u22123, where sea quarks and gluons\np\ndominate, is hrT2 i = 0.65 \u00b1 0.02 fm.

Beyond NLO, further terms in the\nperturbation series are found to be small for an input scale of a few GeV2 . Concerning\nthe scale dependence, larger corrections due to evolution may appear only for values of\n\u03be below 5 * 10\u22123 , similar to the situation in DIS [224].\nBased on this approach, very recently a simultaneous fit was performed to the\nDVCS and DIS collider data, for the first time up to NNLO accuracy [186]. The CS\nscheme was used which differs from the more commonly used MS scheme only in the\nskewness dependence of the conformal moments in the Mellin-Barnes representation, the\nlatter being used to evaluate the Compton form factors.

The figure is taken from [186].\n\ncompared to the data, showing fair agreement. It is argued in [186] that this should be\nconsidered satisfactory, as several aspects of the theoretical approach are not completely\nsettled yet, in particular regarding the skewness dependence of quarks GPDs.\n4.7.2. DVCS cross sections at low energies The helicity-dependent DVCS cross\nsections d4 \u03c3 99K /dQ2 dxB dtd\u03c6 and d4 \u03c3 L99 /dQ2 dxB dtd\u03c6 were measured at JLab with\n5.75 GeV electron beams of positive and negative helicity, respectively [226]. Here\nthe symbol 99K (L99) designates positive (negative) beam helicity. In a three-arm\nkinematically complete experiment, the scattered electron was measured by the highresolution spectrometer, the produced real photon by an electromagnetic calorimeter\nand the recoil proton by a scintillator array. Three photon virtualities were selected\n\n\fSpin-polarized high-energy scattering of charged leptons on nucleons\n\n80\n\nwith xB = 0.36 fixed: Q2 = 1.5, 1.9, 2.3 GeV2 . For each of them, four \u2212t values were\nchosen: 0.17, 0.23, 0.28, 0.33 GeV.\nFrom the two measured single-helicity cross sections, the polarized and unpolarized\nDVCS cross sections were obtained:\n\u0012\n\u0013\nd4 \u03c3 99K\n1\nd4 \u03c3 L99\nd4 \u03a3\n\u221d Im I\n(89)\n=\n\u2212\ndQ2 dxB dtd\u03c6\n2 dQ2 dxB dtd\u03c6 dQ2 dxB dtd\u03c6\n\u0012\n\u0013\nd4 \u03c3\nd4 \u03c3 99K\n1\nd4 \u03c3 L99\n\u221d Re I,\n(90)\n=\n+\ndQ2 dxB dtd\u03c6\n2 dQ2 dxB dtd\u03c6 dQ2 dxB dtd\u03c6\nwhere I is the interference term that consists of linear combinations of Compton Form\nFactors. Cross section measurements involve additional experimental systematics, as no\ncancellations of systematic uncertainties occur as in asymmetry measurements. Such\nmeasurements have the advantage that the cross sections in (89) and (90) are directly\nproportional to Im I and Re I, respectively, while in case of asymmetries unwanted\nBethe-Heitler terms appear in the denominator.\n\nFigure 36.

The polarized cross\nsection exhibits the expected sin \u03c6 behaviour.

Beam-spin asymmetry It was shown in section 4.5 that in hard exclusive\nleptoproduction of a real photon, the interference of the Bethe-Heitler and Deeply\nVirtual Compton Scattering processes allows the extraction of a wealth of information on\nquark GPDs. For the case of an unpolarized (U) proton target, the beam-spin asymmetry\n(BSA) for a longitudinally (L) polarized beam is given by:\nALU (\u03c6) =\n\nd\u03c3 99K (\u03c6) \u2212 d\u03c3 L99 (\u03c6)\n.\nd\u03c3 99K (\u03c6) + d\u03c3 L99 (\u03c6)\n\n(91)\n\nHere 99K (L99) denotes beam spin parallel (antiparallel) to the beam direction.\nThe interference term I can be Fourier expanded in the azimuthal angle \u03c6.\nEvaluating the above asymmetries to leading power in 1/Q in each contribution to\nthis expansion and to leading order in \u03b1S , only the sin \u03c6 (cos \u03c6) term remains in\nthe numerator of the beam-spin (beam-charge) asymmetry. To the extent that the\nleading BH-term dominates the denominator, the azimuthal dependence of the beamspin (beam-charge) asymmetry is reduced to sin \u03c6 (cos \u03c6):\ncU sin \u03c6.\nALU (\u03c6) \u221d Im M\n\n(92)\n\nALU\n\ncU of Compton Form Factors, which\nThe BSA is sensitive to the linear combination M\ndescribes an unpolarized proton target [178] (see (63)).

The dual-parameterization calculation, done with only the forward function\nQ0 , also overshoots the data, although less severely.

Such a description can not be achieved by any of the presently\nexisting GPD models. A similar conclusion is reached in [231] after attempting a\ncombined fit of the two JLab data sets [226, 229] to variants of the VGG model. It\nhas not been tried to estimate the possible influence of higher-order effects for either of\nthe two models.\n4.7.4.

Alternatively, a BCA can also be derived from the cos \u03c6 dependence of\nthe cross section for one beam charge in an hermetic detector of known efficiency.

It offered the additional flexibility of inverting every few weeks, for the same\ncharge of the beam, the direction of its polarization to reduce systematic effects. The\nfirst measurement of a beam-charge asymmetry was published by Hermes [232], based\non the analysis of parts of their electron and positron beam data sets. Somewhat later,\nBCA results were published based on the analysis of another much larger Hermes\ndata sample, taken with transverse target polarisation [233].

Longitudinal target-spin asymmetry Experimental access to quark GPDs other\nthan H f becomes possible when using an unpolarized beam (U) and a polarized target.\nFor longitudinal (L) target polarization, the same sin \u03c6 dependence is expected as for\ncL (64) involves a different\nthe BSA, although the relevant twist-2 Compton amplitude M\ncU (63).\ncombination of Compton Form Factors than does M\nThe longitudinal target-spin asymmetry is defined as:\nd\u03c3 \u21d0 (\u03c6) \u2212 d\u03c3 \u21d2 (\u03c6)\n,\n(95)\nAU L (\u03c6) = \u21d0\nd\u03c3 (\u03c6) + d\u03c3 \u21d2 (\u03c6)\nwhere \u21d0 (\u21d2) denotes target spin antiparallel (parallel) to the beam direction.

For not too small values of t, there exists also some sensitivity to (\u03be E),\nwhich is written in this way because Ee itself is defined to be inversely proportional to \u03be\n(see e.g. [187]).\nExperimental results on longitudinal target-spin asymmetries were obtained at\nJLab [234] and Hermes [235]. Both experiments observe a sin \u03c6 modulation of the\n\u221a\nyield from the entire acceptance, and scaling of the sinusoidal amplitude with \u2212t,\nin agreement with expectations. In figure 41, the JLab data [234] are shown.

Transverse target-spin asymmetry In the case of target polarization transverse\n(T) to the direction of the virtual photon, the polarization can be resolved into two\nindependent components, 'normal' to and 'sideways' in the production plane [236],\ndefined by the directions of the virtual and real photons. The DVCS cross section\ncT , the normal component of the twist-2 Compton amplitude (see\ndepends only on M\n(65)). This is the only amplitude that embodies a combination of CFFs in which the\ncontributions of the quark GPDs E f are not kinematically suppressed relative to those\nof H f . Hence DVCS measurements on a transversely polarized proton target appear to\nbe crucial for the evaluation of Ju and Jd through the Ji relation (37). A complication\ninherent to the exploitation of this relation lies in the fact that both quark GPDs H f\nand E f need to be determined in the limit t \u2192 0, whereas at small t the relevant\n\u221a\nasymmetry is suppressed by a factor of t0 \u2212 t/2m when extracting the GPDs H f and\neven by a factor of (t0 \u2212 t)/4m2 when extracting the GPDs E f (which is apparent from\na comparison of (63) and (65)).

The sizes of the small rectangles represent the statistical\nuncertainties of the lattice results and the parameter range for which a good DFJK fit\nto the nucleon form factor data was achieved. Theoretical uncertainties are unavailable.\nThe figure is taken from [233].\n\ndependent constraints on these two parameters can be derived by fitting them to\n\n\fSpin-polarized high-energy scattering of charged leptons on nucleons\n\n89\n\nexperimental observables [237]. The double-distribution model [125, 198] was thereby\nfitted to azimuthal amplitudes of beam-charge and transverse target-spin asymmetries\nmeasured on the proton at Hermes (see previous section). The resulting constraint [233]\nis shown in figure 43 as sloped band, which in units of ~ can be represented as\nJu + Jd /2.8 = 0.49 \u00b1 0.17(exptot ).\n\n(98)\n\nCombining DVCS measurements on deuteron and proton targets, the beam-spin\ndifference for the neutron was determined at JLab [238]. Also in this case sensitivity to\nthe GPDs E f can be found, as for the neutron the prefactor F1 (t) in (63) is small but\nF2 (t) is not. Similarly as described above, a model-dependent constraint on (Ju , Jd ) was\nderived by comparison to a calculation of the double-distribution model. The slope of\nthe resulting band differs from that of the band derived from proton data (see figure 43)\ndue to the different quark contents of proton and neutron:\nJu + Jd /5.0 = 0.18 \u00b1 0.14(exptot ).\n\n(99)\n\nThese results show that existing data have the potential to provide quantitative\ninformation about the quark total angular momenta Ju and Jd . However, as discussed\nin the previous sections, the double-distribution model of [125, 198] cannot explain all\nexisting DVCS data.\n5. The spin budget of the nucleon\n5.1. Decomposing the Nucleon Spin\nWhile the total angular momentum of an isolated system is uniquely defined, ambiguities\narise when decomposing the total angular momentum of an interacting multi-constituent\nsystem into contributions from various constituents. Moreover, in a gauge theory,\nswitching the gauge may result in shuffling angular momentum between matter and\ngauge degrees of freedom. In the context of nucleon structure, this gives rise to subtleties\nin defining these quantities that are more fundamental than those subtleties associated\nwith the choice of factorization scheme, mentioned in section 2.4.\nIn section 4.1, it was discussed how GPDs can be used to determine the quark total\nangular momentum contribution Jf to the nucleon spin (see (37)) in a gauge invariant\ndecomposition of the nucleon's spin 12 .

However,\nthe difference between these two operators has no fundamental connection to orbital\nangular momentum other than being the difference between JG and \u2206G.\nEquation (100) is a special case of Ji's decomposition [19]\n\u0011\nX\u0010\n~f + L\n~ f + J~G\nS\n(102)\nJ~ =\nf\n\nof the expectation value of the angular momentum operator. Since this decomposition\nof the angular momentum density M \u03bc\u03bd\u03bb = T \u03bc\u03bd x\u03bb \u2212 T \u03bc\u03bb x\u03bd , where T \u03bc\u03bd = T \u03bd\u03bc is\nthe energy-momentum tensor, in terms of manifestly gauge invariant local operators\n(see footnote on page 64) is based on the decomposition of the M 0ij -component\n~f is defined through\n(i, j \u2208 {x, y, z}), it is independent of the quantization axis.

A further decomposition\nwhere E\nof J~G into spin and orbital components using manifestly gauge invariant local operators\n\nhas not been found and may be impossible. In general, spin (or 'intrinsic' angular\nmomentum) is identified with terms in the operator that do not depend explicitly on ~r,\nin contradistinction to the orbital (or 'extrinsic') piece [241].\nBeing based on manifestly gauge invariant local operators, all three terms in (102)\ncan be calculated in lattice gauge theory. As was discussed in previous sections, the\n~f and J~f can be accessed experimentally, and J~G can, at least\nexpectation values S\nin principle, be accessed in exclusive deeply virtual heavy meson production. Beyond\nleading order in \u03b1s , all three terms in (102) depend on Q2 , but the Q2 dependence\ncancels in their sum.\nThe main disadvantage of decomposition (102) is that for no choice of the\nquantization axis is there a partonic interpretation as a difference between number\n~ f or the gluon total angular\ndensities for the quark orbital angular momentum L\n~f has such an\nmomentum J~G . Only the quark intrinsic angular momentum S\ninterpretation (for the \u1e91 quantization axis). This is because the operator definitions for\n~ f and J~G contain interactions (e.g. L\n~ f contains the gluon field through the gaugeL\n~ = \u2202~ \u2212 ig A).\n~\ncovariant derivative D\nWith quarks and gluons thereby inextricably\nintertwined, it is impossible to unambigiously identify these terms with quark orbital\nangular momentum, and gluon angular momentum respectively [242].\nAn alternative 'light-cone decomposition' was proposed by Jaffe and Manohar [243]\n(see also [244, 245]). While the Ji-decomposition is based on the M 0ij component of the\nangular momentum density, the Jaffe-Manohar decomposition is based on the M +xy\n~ It can be written as:\ncomponent and applies only to the z component of J.\n1\n1\n= Jz = \u2206\u03a3 + \u2206G + L.\n(103)\n2\n2\n\n\fSpin-polarized high-energy scattering of charged leptons on nucleons\n\n91\n\nThe quantity \u2206\u03a3 appears also in (100), the special case of (102) in the helicity basis. The\nquark-intrinsic piece is the same in both components: the operator that measures this\npiece in M +12 is \u01eb+12\u2212 \u03c8 \u2020 \u03b3\u2212 \u03b35 \u03c8 and the operator that measures it in M 012 is \u01eb0123 \u03c8 \u2020 \u03b33 \u03b35 \u03c8,\ni.e. both operators are components of the axial vector current and therefore their\nexpectation values are proportional to the axial charge, so that \u2206\u03a3 appears in both\ndecompositions. This is not true for any other term in the decompositions! One can\nunderstand this point by analogy with the energy momentum tensor T \u03bc\u03bd [242]: The\nenergy of a single particle state can be expressed in terms of the matrix element of\nT 00 and decomposed into a quark and gluon piece. The 'momentum' in the infinitemomentum frame corresponds to the matrix element of T ++ and can also be decomposed\ninto quark and gluon pieces. The quark and gluon pieces of these two objects are\nunrelated.\nIn decomposition (103), each term has a partonic interpretation. The gluon spin\ncontribution \u2206G appears explicitly. It is experimentally accessible (see section 2.8)\nand can be defined as the expectation value of a (nonlocal) manifestly gauge invariant\noperator. In light-cone gauge, this operator collapses to a local operator (and its\nexpectation value has a partonic interpretation). No direct experimental access to the\nparton orbital angular momentum L has been identified. Its value can be obtained only\nby subtracting the quark and gluon spin contributions from the nucleon spin. Both\n\u2206G and L can be defined through matrix elements of local operators only in light-cone\ngauge A+ = 0. Explicit definitions for the operators appearing in both decompositions\ncan be found in [242]. Since neither one can be represented as the matrix element of\na manifestly gauge invariant local operator, they cannot be analytically continued to\nEuclidean space and are thus inaccessible for lattice QCD.\nOne can decompose L further into contributions from gluons and each quark flavor\nX\nL=\nLf + LG ,\n(104)\nf\n\nwhere for example, the contribution Lf from quarks with flavour f can be obtained from\nthe expectation value of \u03c8f\u2020 + (xpy \u2212 ypx ) \u03c8f + (with \u03c8f + being the dynamical or 'good'\ncomponent of the quark field operator \u03c8f in that framework) for a nucleon polarized\nalong the \u1e91 direction. Each of the terms in (104) has a partonic interpretation. Even a\ndecomposition with respect to the momentum fraction x is possible, but for none of these\nterms has experimental access been identified nor are they accessible in lattice QCD,\nsince their manifestly gauge invariant forms are nonlocal in Minkowski space [246].\nNevertheless, their expectation values can be easily related to the (light-cone) wave\nfunctions of hadrons, which play an important role in phenomenology [247].\nSummarising the above dichotomy, the two decompositions described above have\nonly \u2206\u03a3 in common, which is also manifestly gauge invariant and experimentally\naccessible. The experimentally accessible quantities Jf (and, by subtraction, Lf and\nJG ) appear in one decomposition, while \u2206G (and, by subtraction, L) appear in the\nother. Combining terms from these incommensurate decompositions would be a sterile\nP\nexercise. For example, after determining JG = 12 \u2212 f Jf by evaluating the right hand\n\n\fSpin-polarized high-energy scattering of charged leptons on nucleons\n\n92\n\nside using the Ji relation for Jf , it would be fruitless to 'determine' LG by subtracting\n\u2206G from JG (or equivalently by subtracting Lq from L). In fact, the last step would\nyield a term that is neither directly experimentally accessible nor could it be represented\nby an operator other than that defined as the difference of the two operators. Defining\ngluon orbital angular momentum through such a subtraction procedure has no predictive\npower (not even in principle).\nNote that an analogous dichotomy (multichotomy) appears when one considers the\nmotion of a charged particle in an electromagnetic field. While the canonical momentum\np \u2261 \u2212i\u2207 has a simple interpretation in terms of only the charged particle's wave\nfunction, it is not gauge invariant. Evaluation of the gauge invariant combination p\u2212eA\nrequires in addition knowledge about the vector potential. This combination is directly\naccessible experimentally, e.g. on a macroscopic scale by studying the trajectory of the\nparticle in a magnetic field. Similarly, while the canonical orbital angular momentum\nr \u00d7 p \u2261 \u2212ir \u00d7 \u2207 has a simple interpretation as a property of the charged particle's\nwave function alone, it is unfortunately not gauge invariant. On the other hand,\nthe gauge invariant combination r \u00d7 (p \u2212 eA) contains the vector potential A and\nits interpretation is therefore more subtle. Furthermore, only the gauge noninvariant\norbital angular momentum r \u00d7 p satisfies the familiar angular momentum commutation\nrelations [Li , Lj ] = i\u03b5ijk Lk . In the end, both definitions of the angular momentum\nof the charged particle have their merit, and depending on the context either may be\npreferable.\nAnalogously, in the decomposition of the nucleon spin, it also turns out that\nboth schemes have their respective merits. In Ji's decomposition both Jq and JG\nare manifestly gauge invariant and calculable in lattice gauge theory (see section\n4.4). Furthermore, using (37) Jf can be measured, which allows determination of\nLf = Jf \u2212 21 (\u2206qf + \u2206q\u0304f ). However, since it is even more difficult to relate JG to\nmeasurable quantities (e.g.using (38)) than is the case for Jf , the relation can currently\nnot be 'tested', while it can nevertheless be used to determine JG = 12 \u2212 Jq , which is\ninterpreted as gluon total angular momentum in the equal time quantized framework\nonly.\nBesides a partonic interpretation of all terms, the Jaffe-Manohar decomposition\n(103) has the advantage that it contains the experimentally accessible quantity \u2206G\n(see section 2.8). Unfortunately, also here no experimental observable has been found\nto relate to Lf or LG even in principle, so the light-cone based spin decomposition\ncannot be tested either, but one can still use the sum rule to determine the net\nparton orbital angular momentum L. Another disadvantage of the light-cone based\ndecomposition (103) is that because the operators used to define its terms (except \u2206\u03a3)\nare not manifestly gauge invariant, its terms cannot be calculated in lattice gauge theory.\nNevertheless, although a simple (i.e. local) operator expression for \u2206G exists only in\nlight-cone gauge, it can be defined through a manifestly gauge invariant operator. In\nall other gauges, \u2206G is described by matrix elements of a non-local operator rendering\nits calculation or interpretation exceedingly difficult. \u2206G has a physical interpretation\n\n\fSpin-polarized high-energy scattering of charged leptons on nucleons\n\n93\n\nas the gluon intrinsic angular momentum in the light-cone framework only.\nThe two decompositions of the nucleon spin discussed here are not the only\npossibilities. For example, another alternative has been proposed in [248,249]. However,\nit neither has a partonic interpretation nor does its orbital angular momentum seem to\nbe experimentally accessible and we will not discuss this decomposition here.\nAn analogue may illustrate the dangers in mixing components from different\ndecompositions: suppose hypothetically that DIS data on deuterium were available only\nat Q2 = 100 GeV2 and proton data were available only at Q2 = 10 GeV2 . The normal\nprocedure for extracting neutron data would be to evolve to a common Q2 value first.\nHowever, again hypothetically, suppose there existed no evolution equations. One may\nthen ask oneself whether it would make sense (without first evolving the results from\none Q2 to the other value of Q2 ) to subtract the distribution ofu quarks in the proton\nat Q2 = 10 GeV2 from that in the deuteron at Q2 = 100 GeV2 and use the results to\ndefine the distribution of u quarks in the neutron. The main weakness of this analogy\nis of course that this definition is falsifiable because experiments may be performed at\ndifferent values of Q2 or QCD evolution may be discovered.\n5.2. Implications for quark angular momenta\n5.2.1. Results using the Ji relation Due to the difficulties in extracting GPDs from\nDVCS data, no model-independent experimental constraints on the Ji relation yet exist.\nLattice-based constraints on Jf have been discussed in section 4.4 and indicate that\nLu + Ld is consistent with zero, while Lu \u2212 Ld \u2248 \u22120.4 \u00b1 0.05. In that subsection\nit was already emphasized that this result is counterintuitive, where the intuition\nderives from comparison to constituent quark models and phenomenology for single-spin\nasymmetries. Given the complementary and incommensurate definitions of quark orbital\nangular momentum, as discussed in the previous section, the question arises whether\nthe orbital angular momentum in these models should be identified with Lf in (102) or\nwith Lf in (104). If they were to be identified with Lf , there would be additional, and\npresently unknown, corrections added to account for the difference before the orbital\nangular momentum in the models could be compared to the lattice QCD results.\n5.2.2. Results in the light-cone decomposition The existing information on \u2206G from\nglobal fits of experimental data suggests that its first moment is small [65]. Neglecting\n'theoretical' and model uncertainties such as those associated with the choice of\nfunctional forms used to represent PDFs in the fits while interpreting table 2 leads\nto \u2206G \u2243 \u22120.1 \u00b1 0.1(expt.) for \u2206\u03c72 = 1. Using the most precise result for \u2206\u03a3 =\n0.33 \u00b1 0.03(tot.) [47] the net parton orbital angular momentum is obtained from (103)\nas:\nX\nLf + LG \u2243 0.43 \u00b1 0.1,\n(105)\nL=\nf\n\n\fSpin-polarized high-energy scattering of charged leptons on nucleons\n\n94\n\nwhich would be more than twice the intrinsic contribution from quarks. It remains open\nhow gluons and quarks share their orbital contributions.\n6. Conclusions and Outlook\nOne measure of the vitality of a field is the rapidity with which its conceptual framework\nand focus evolve. By this measure, the study of the internal spin structure of the proton\nis indeed vital. Its explosive birth in the late 1980's was triggered by the development of\nexperimental technologies for Deeply Inelastic Scattering (DIS) of polarized high energy\nleptons on targets containing polarized protons. The pivotal EMC measurement [17,18]\nsuggested that the helicities of the quarks combine to make a net contribution to the\nhelicity of the proton that is small compared to naive expectations. This finding\ninspired a flood of theoretical papers and several major new experimental efforts at\nthree laboratories, which confirmed the original finding with much higher precision, and\nextended the measurements to the neutron target to help distinguish the contributions\nof the various quark flavours. While u quarks were found to be strongly polarized in\nthe same direction as the parent proton, both d quarks and even s quarks were found\nto be negatively polarized. These measurements of inclusive DIS asymmetries were\nextended to semi-inclusive measurements where the type of hadron produced in the\nfragmentation of the struck quark tends to 'tag' the flavour of that quark. The resulting\ndata indicate that the helicity densities of sea quarks are small in the measured x range\nof 0.02 < x < 0.4, but still consistent with fits to inclusive data yielding a negative\nfirst moment for the strange sea, which receives a significant negative contribution from\nx < 0.02.\nAttention soon focused on a possibly substantial role of the helicity of the gluons,\nwhich is experimentally difficult to probe in DIS. While some of the existing new\nexperiments struggled to extract constraints on the gluon polarization, yet more new\nefforts were launched that were designed specifically to target this problem. At the\ntime of writing, these are beginning to bear fruit, suggesting that the fractional gluon\nhelicity contribution is small, and together with the quark helicities, do not exhaust the\n'spin budget' of the proton. This leaves the question of the contribution of parton\norbital angular momentum. In the light-cone framework for defining this quantity\nwith a partonic interpretation in the axial gauge, one can estimate it as the difference\nL = 12 \u2212 12 \u2206\u03a3 \u2212 \u2206G. Although \u2206\u03a3 is precisely known from measurements of g1d , the\nfirst moment \u2206G is still so poorly known that there is still little direct experimental\nconstraint on the contribution of parton orbital angular momentum to the nucleon spin.\nIn the 1990's, dramatic theoretical progress reshaped the field, identifying new\nexperimental signals for nucleon spin structure. One key issue has been quark\ntransversity, which differs from helicity because of the relativistic internal motion\nof quarks. It was realized that single-spin asymmetries in semi-inclusive scattering\noffered access to this elusive property, through a dependence of the fragmentation\nprocess on the transverse polarization of the struck quark-the Collins effect. While\n\n\fSpin-polarized high-energy scattering of charged leptons on nucleons\n\n95\n\ninitial experimental evidence for this phenomenon was ambiguous, eventually SIDIS\nmeasurements with transverse target polarization in combination with studies of the jet\nstructure of hadrons from e+ e\u2212 collisions provided a data set with a clear interpretation,\nleading to the first extraction of transversity distributions. As expected, they are found\nto share the features of the helicity distributions in that they are positive for u quarks,\nand negative and considerably smaller for d quarks. Their magnitudes are found be\nbe about half of the Soffer positivity bounds, which are expressed in terms of the\nunpolarized and helicity densities.\nOne of the ambiguities that complicated the interpretation of early measurements\nof single-spin asymmetries was a possible contribution by the Sivers effect, which\narises from a 'naively T-odd' correlation between the nucleon spin and the intrinsic\ntransverse momentum of quarks. This developed into a fascinating topic of its own\nwhen it was realized that such distributions raise new questions about key theorems\nfor factorization of hard and soft dynamics of processes, and the importance of initial\nor final-state interactions in the understanding of parton distributions that depend\non intrinsic transverse momentum. The above-mentioned SIDIS measurements with\ntransverse target polarization also provided clear evidence of the Sivers effect. Future\nhigh-luminosity measurements of the Drell-Yan process with transversely polarized\nprotons are now anticipated as a test of the new prediction that the Sivers effect will\nappear there with the opposite sign.\nThe pursuit of parton orbital angular momentum also led to dramatic theoretical\nprogress in the late 1990's. It was realized that experimental access to this quantity\nmight be provided by hard exclusive processes that involve hard interactions, yet leave\nthe target nucleon intact. Most prominent among these processes is deeply virtual\nCompton scattering, the production of a single energetic photon, because of its fruitful\ninterference with the well-understood Bethe-Heitler process, providing access to the\nphase of the DVCS amplitude. Such exclusive processes are now interpreted within the\nframework of generalized parton distributions that depend on three kinematic variables\nand subsume both elastic form factors as moments and ordinary parton distributions\nas special cases. The excitement centered around the finding that a second moment of\ncertain GPDs provides the total angular momentum of partons, including orbital angular\nmomentum. Although existing DIS experimental facilities were not designed to measure\nexclusive processes, they managed to make some pioneering measurements, which have\nbeen compared to calculations based on the few available GPD parameterizations.\nWhile the basic features of the data are described, none of the existing GPD models\nare able to simultaneously explain all available DVCS data, including cross sections\nand their differences or asymmetries with respect to beam charge and helicity, and\ntarget polarization. Nevertheless, the data for transverse target polarization were\nshown to be sensitive to quark total angular momentum, of which the contribution\nfrom quark intrinsic spin has already been determined as mentioned above. Hence the\ndevelopment of more successful parameterizations can be expected to thereby result in\nconstraints on quark orbital angular momentum. Promising efforts already underway\n\n\fSpin-polarized high-energy scattering of charged leptons on nucleons\n\n96\n\nbased on 'conformal moments' offer a practical means of fitting DVCS data with\nparameterizations at NLO in \u03b1s . Some success with this approach has been achieved\nwith DVCS cross sections at collider energies, and work continues to extend this to\ncharge and polarization dependences at fixed-target energies.\nA decade ago, progress in the understanding of nonperturbative QCD was\nmade mainly by comparing experimental data with models that were constructed to\napproximately embody some important features of QCD. Since then, rapid progress\nhas been made in improving the scope and precision of numerical simulations of QCD\non a Euclidean lattice. Improved algorithms and techniques together with rapidly\nincreasing computational power have combined to bring this field to the point that\nresults for a large variety of observables can now be taken seriously as implications of\nQCD. An example is the spin budget of the proton, where it is computed that the\nonly substantial contribution by quarks is from the u flavour, in which the positive\ncontribution from quark intrinsic spin dominates the negative contribution from orbital\nangular momentum. While several types of important observables will remain inacessible\nto this approach for the forseeable future (such as the gluonic contribution to the\nspin budget), others that are are calculable are so difficult to measure experimentally\nthat lattice calculations will be the only source of information about them for a\nconsiderable time. Examples here include chiral-odd generalized parton distributions.\nHence calculations on the lattice play a role that is highly complementary to both\nexperiment and model building.\nThe existing experimental facilities for polarized DIS have provided a wealth of\nnew data, much of it unanticipated when those experiments were conceived. For\nexample, they have provided high quality data for inclusive measurements of doublespin asymmetries, determining the spin structure function g1 of the proton and neutron\nover the kinematic range of fixed-target experiments. However, other important avenues\nto nucleon spin structure such as semi-inclusive DIS and exclusive processes have been\nexploited with only enough precision to inspire and guide rapid theoretical progress,\nbut not to provide detailed information. Also, the experience from the HERA e \u2212 p\ncollider taught us that the vastly wider kinematic range available at such a collider\ncan lead to unanticipated insights, in part because of the much improved access to\nthe region of small x. One clear motivation for planning for a high-luminosity e \u2212 p\ncollider with polarized beams is to obtain data for g1 over a wide range in hard scale\nQ2 to allow the precise inference of gluon polarization from the Q2 evolution of g1 , in\nanalogy to the success in extracting the unpolarized gluon density from HERA data.\nThe rapidly expanding horizons of the field in the last decade have provided other\ncompelling motivations. Only with high luminosity free of target dilution by unpolarized\ncomponents and a broad kinematic range can precise information be produced in the\nstudy of transversity, transverse-momentum-dependent parton distributions and quark\norbital momentum through the constraint of generalized parton distributions. The clear\nneed for a new accelerator facility to make this all possible has inspired specific proposals\nand design studies [250]. Luminosities of order 1033 nucleons/(cm2 s) are considered\n\n\fSpin-polarized high-energy scattering of charged leptons on nucleons\n97\n\u221a\npossible in the energy range s = 15\u2013100 GeV. The continuing vitality of this exciting\nfield depends on the determined pursuit of this goal. While the community works toward\nthis new facility, the present rate of rapid conceptual progress in the field will depend\non a continuing flow of new data from Compass [89], the only remaining high-energy\nlepton DIS facility, as well as from Jefferson Laboratory, especially after it achieves its\n12 GeV upgrade [251].\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors would like to warmly thank Markus Diehl, Klaus Rith and Werner\nVogelsang for reading and providing a critique of a draft of this paper.

Recent published values of first moments of helicity densities, separated into experimental evaluations based on the first moment\nof g1d , and evaluations from NLO QCD fits of various overlapping data sets. The DSSV values for \u2206s + \u2206s\u0304are computed from their fit\nresult for \u2206s\u0304 using their assumption \u2206s = \u2206s\u0304. The fit uncertainties for \u2206\u03c72 = 1 account only for experimental statistical and systematic\nuncertainties added in quadrature, and not for 'theoretical' or model uncertainties. The DSSV uncertainties apply only to the partial\nmoments over the range x > 0.001, and hence should be interpreted with care. All evaluations are in the MS scheme.\n\n104\n\n\f"}
