We also improve the wave packet treatment of neutrino oscillations\ntaking into account explicitly the finite coherence time of the detection process.\n\n\fThe experimental and theoretical investigation of neutrino oscillations is presently one of\nthe most active fields of research in high-energy physics. For the interpretation of experimental data it is important to have a clear and correct theoretical formulation of the neutrino\noscillation mechanism1 . In particular, the phase \u03a6kj of neutrino oscillations in vacuum due\nto the interference of the contributions of two massive neutrinos \u03bdk and \u03bdj with masses mk\nand mj , respectively, depends on the mass-squared differences \u2206m2kj \u2261 m2k \u2212 m2j . A correct\ntheoretical expression of the oscillation phase \u03a6kj is important in order to extract from the\nexperimental data correct information on the value of \u2206m2kj .\nThe standard expression for the oscillation phase \u03a6kj in the relativistic approximation is\n\u03a6kj = \u2212\n\n\u2206m2kj L\n,\n2E\n\n(1)\n\nwhere E is the neutrino energy and L is the distance between the neutrino source and\ndetector.\nIt has been argued by some authors [3,4] that the expression (1) is wrong by a factor of two\non the basis of the following reasoning. Neutrino experiments measure neutrino oscillations\nas a function of the source-detector distance L. Different massive neutrinos propagate with\ndifferent velocities\npk\nvk =\n,\n(2)\nEk\nwhere Ek and pk are, respectively, the energy and momentum of the neutrino with mass mk ,\nrelated by the relativistic dispersion relation\nEk2 = p2k + m2k .\n\n(3)\n\nHence, the phases of the different massive neutrinos wave functions after a propagation\ndistance L should take into account the different times of propagation of different massive\nneutrinos:\ne k = pk L \u2212 Ek tk .\n\u03a6\n(4)\nThe different propagation times are given by\ntk =\n\nL\nEk\n=\nL,\nvk\npk\n\n(5)\n\nwhich lead, in the relativistic approximation, to the phase difference\ne kj \u2261 \u03a6\nek \u2212 \u03a6\nej = \u2212\n\u2206\u03a6\n\n\u2206m2kj L\n.\nE\n\n(6)\n\nThis phase difference is twice of the standard one in Eq. (1). A similar disagreement by a\nfactor of two has been claimed to exist in the case of kaon oscillations in Refs. [5\u20137].\nLet us notice that in Eq. (4) we have considered the possibility of different energies and\nmomenta for different massive neutrino wave functions. Indeed, it has been shown in Ref. [8]\n1\n\nSee Ref. [1] for a review of the theory of neutrino oscillations and Ref. [2] for an exhaustive list of\nreferences.\n\n1\n\n\fthat Lorentz invariance implies that in general in oscillation experiments different massive\nneutrinos have different energies and different momenta. The energy E in Eqs. (1) and (6)\nis the energy of the massive neutrinos in the massless limit, i.e. neglecting the differences of\nenergy due to the masses.\nThe authors of Refs. [9\u201311] claimed that a correct way to obtain the standard oscillation\nphase is to assume the same energy for the different massive neutrino wave functions. This is\nan unphysical assumption, as discussed in Ref. [8]. Moreover, as already noticed in Ref. [3],\nit is not true that the disagreement of a factor of two disappears assuming the same energy\nfor the different massive neutrino wave functions, as clearly shown by the above derivation\nof Eq. (6), in which the energies of the different massive neutrino wave functions could have\nbeen taken to be equal. Indeed, even if the different massive neutrino wave functions have\ne kj does not\nthe same energy, the time contribution \u2212Etk + Etj to the phase difference \u2206\u03a6\ndisappear, because tk 6= tj . This contribution has been missed in Refs. [9\u201311].\nIn order to test the validity of the reasoning of the authors of Refs. [3, 4], let us apply\ntheir method to the well-known double-slit interference experiment depicted in Fig. 1. The\nparticles emitted by the source S and detected could be photons or electrons, or others.\nThe screen A has two holes through which the particles can reach the screen B on which a\ndetector registers the arrival of the particles at a distance x from the center of the screen.\nIn the standard approach, the phases of the two waves at x at the time t are given by\n\u03a6k = p rk \u2212 E t = p (rA + rBk ) \u2212 E t ,\n\n(7)\n\nfor k = 1, 2. Hence, the phase difference is\n\u2206\u03a6 \u2261 \u03a62 \u2212 \u03a61 = p \u2206r ,\n\n(8)\n\nwith\n\n2ax\n,\n(9)\nd\nwhere the approximation holds for x, a \u226a d. Since p = 2\u03c0/\u03bb, where \u03bb is the wavelength,\nthe maxima of interference are given by the usual well known formula x = n\u03bbd/2a, with\nn = 0, 1, . . ., which has been confirmed by many experiments without any doubt.\nLet us apply now the reasoning of the authors of Refs. [3, 4]. If one takes into account\nthe velocity of the particles, the two paths have different propagation times\nrk\ntk =\n,\n(10)\nv\n\u2206r \u2261 r2 \u2212 r1 = rB2 \u2212 rB1 \u2243\n\nwhere v is the velocity,\n\np\n.\nE\nIn this approach, the phases of the two waves at x are given by\nv=\n\ne k = p rk \u2212 E tk .\n\u03a6\n\nThe phase difference at x turns out to be\n\u0012\n\u0013\nE\na m2\ne\u2261\u03a6\ne2 \u2212 \u03a6\ne1 = p \u2212\n\u2206\u03a6\n\u2206r \u2243 \u22122 x\n,\nv\nd p\n2\n\n(11)\n\n(12)\n\n(13)\n\n\fwhere the approximation holds for x, a \u226a d. This phase difference is very different from the\ncorrect one in Eq. (8), and it even vanishes for massless particles (as photons).\nTherefore, the reasoning presented in Refs. [3, 4] is wrong.\nThe mistake in the claim formulated in Refs. [3, 4] is due to a wrong use of the group\nvelocity in the phase, which depends on the phase velocity. The group velocity (given in\nEq. (2) for neutrinos and in Eq. (11) for the double-slit experiment) is the velocity of the\nfactor that modulates the amplitude of a wave packet describing a localized particle. In the\ndouble-slit experiment there are two wave packets which propagate along the two paths in\nFig. 1. The envelopes of these wave packets take different times to cover the two different\ndistances from the source S to the point x on the screen. But this has no effect on the phases.\nOnly the amplitude of the final wave function is determined by the modulating factors of\nthe amplitudes of the two wave packets. The different arrival times of the envelopes of the\nwave packets reduces the overlap of the two wave packets, leading to a decoherence effect.\nLet us illustrate these concepts in a one-dimensional formalism using a Gaussian momentum distribution with width \u03c3p , centered at the momentum p:\n#\n\"\n2\n\u0010\u221a\n\u0011\u22121/2\n\u2032\n(p \u2212 p)\n\u03c8(p\u2032 ) =\n.\n(14)\n2\u03c0 \u03c3p\nexp \u2212\n4\u03c3p2\nFor \u03c3p << p, the corresponding wave packet in space-time is\n#\n\"\n\u0010\u221a\n\u0011\u22121/2\n(r \u2212 vt)2\n,\n\u03c8(r, t) =\n2\u03c0 \u03c3r\nexp i p r \u2212 i E t \u2212\n4\u03c3r2\np\nwhere \u03c3r = 1/2\u03c3p , E = p2 + m2 , and v = p/E is the velocity of the envelope\n#\n\"\n\u0010\u221a\n\u0011\u22121/2\n(r \u2212 vt)2\n2\u03c0 \u03c3r\nexp \u2212\n4\u03c3r2\n\n(15)\n\n(16)\n\nof the wave packet. The real part of the wave packet (15) at t = 0 is depicted by the solid\nline in Fig. 2, with the envelope (16) represented by the dashed line. It is important to\nunderstand that the wave packet in the approximation (15) is a monochromatic wave whose\namplitude is modulated by the envelope factor (16), that has no effect on the phase factor\nexp [i p r \u2212 i E t]\n\n(17)\n\nof the wave packet.\nThe amplitudes of each of the two wave packets traveling the two paths in the double-slit\nexperiment in Fig. 1 at the distance x from the center of screen B at the time t is given by\n#\n\"\n\u0011\u22121/2\n1 \u0010\u221a\n(rk \u2212 vt)2\n\u03c8(rk , t) = \u221a\n,\n(18)\n2\u03c0 \u03c3r\nexp i p rk \u2212 i E t \u2212\n4\u03c3r2\n2\nfor k = 1, 2, with rk = rA + rBk . The probability to detect the particle at the point x at the\ntime t is\nP (x, t) \u221d |\u03c8(r1 , t) + \u03c8(r2 , t)|2\n3\n\n\f1\n\u221a\n\u221d\n2 2\u03c0 \u03c3r\n\n#\n\"\n#\n(r2 \u2212 vt)2\n(r1 \u2212 vt)2\n+ exp \u2212\nexp \u2212\n2\u03c3r2\n2\u03c3r2\n\"\n#)\n(r1 \u2212 vt)2 + (r2 \u2212 vt)2\n+2 cos(p\u2206r) exp \u2212\n,\n4\u03c3r2\n\n(\n\n\"\n\n(19)\n\nwhere we have omitted an appropriate normalization factor, that must be inserted in order\nto normalize the probability over the screen.\nFrom Eq. (19) it is clear that the probability to detect the particle at x is appreciable only\nwhen one of the two wave packets cover the detector. Interference of the two wave functions\nis possible if both wave packets cover the detector simultaneously. However, usually the\ndetector operates for a long time without recording the precise instant of detection. In this\ncase, the probability of detection at x is given by the time average of P (x, t) in Eq. (19):\n\u0015\u001b\n\u001a\n\u0014\n1\n\u2206r 2\nP (x) \u221d\n.\n(20)\n1 + cos(p\u2206r) exp \u2212 2\n2\n8\u03c3r\nThe interference term gives an appreciable contribution only if the separation \u2206r of the two\nwave packets is smaller than their width, i.e. if there is an overlap of the two wave packets\nat the detector. It is clear that the different propagation times of the envelopes of the two\nwave packets has no effect on the phase of the interference term, that is equal to the phase\nin Eq. (8), obtained in the plane wave approximation. This is what we wanted to show with\nthis simple example.\nAn interesting complication to the problem stems from the fact, noted in Ref. [12], that\ndifferent wave packets can interfere even if they do not overlap at the detector if the coherence\ntime of the detection process is larger than the time separation between the arrival of the\nwave packets. In order to take into account this effect in the double-slit experiment, we\nhave to introduce an appropriate wave function for the detection process. Assuming that\nthe detection process has a coherence time \u03c3tD and the detection occurs at the time tD , we\ndescribe the detection process with the Gaussian wave packet\n#\n\"\n\u0010\u221a\n\u0011\u22121/2\n(t \u2212 tD )2\n.\n(21)\n\u03c8D (t, tD ) =\n2\u03c0 \u03c3tD\nexp \u2212i E (t \u2212 tD ) \u2212\n2\n4\u03c3tD\nThe frequency of the detection process is the same as that of the absorbed wave function,\nbecause the incoming wave function excites the corresponding degree of freedom of the\ndetection process. The amplitude of detection of each of the two incoming wave packets is\ngiven by the overlap of the incoming wave packet (18) and the detection process wave packet\n(21):\nZ\nA(rk , tD ) \u221d\n\n\u2217\ndt \u03c8D\n(t, tD ) \u03c8(rk , t) .\n\n(22)\n\nPerforming the integration over t, we obtain\n\n#\n\"\n\u0011\u22121/2\n1 \u0010\u221a\n(rk \u2212 vtD )2\n2\u03c0 \u03c3\nA(rk , tD ) \u221d \u221a\n,\nexp i p rk \u2212 i E tD \u2212\n4\u03c3 2\n2\n4\n\n(23)\n\n\fwith\n2\n\u03c3 2 \u2261 \u03c3r2 + v 2 \u03c3tD\n.\n\n(24)\n\nOne can see that the time allowed for a coherent absorption of the incoming wave packet is\nincreased by the coherence time of the detection process, that dominates if v \u03c3tD \u226b \u03c3r .\nThe probability to detect the particle at x at the time tD is now given by\nP (x, tD ) \u221d |A(r1 , tD ) + A(r2 , tD )|2\n#\n\"\n#\n(\n\"\n(r2 \u2212 vtD )2\n1\n(r1 \u2212 vtD )2\n\u221a\n+ exp \u2212\n\u221d\nexp \u2212\n2\u03c3 2\n2\u03c3 2\n2 2\u03c0 \u03c3\n\"\n#)\n(r1 \u2212 vtD )2 + (r2 \u2212 vtD )2\n+2 cos(p\u2206r) exp \u2212\n.\n4\u03c3 2\n\n(25)\n\nThis equation has the same structure as Eq. (19), with the width \u03c3r of the wave packets\nreplaced by \u03c3. Obviously, the average over the unmeasured detection time tD leads to an\nexpression for the probability to detect the particle at x given by Eq. (20) with \u03c3r replaced\nby \u03c3, which takes into account also the coherence time of the detection process.\nTherefore, we have seen that the coherence time of the detection process, which allows a\ncoherent absorption of wave packets arriving at the detector at different times, do not have\nany effect on the phase of the interference between different wave functions, refuting the\narguments presented in Refs. [3, 4]. The resulting prescription in calculations performed in\nthe plane wave approximation (i.e neglecting the wave packet character of wave functions\nthat describe localized particles) is to calculate the interference of different wave functions\nat the same time and the same space point [13, 14].\nThe physical explanation of the independence of the phase of the interference between\ndifferent wave functions from their arrival time at the detector has been presented in Ref. [15].\nIt consists in taking into account that there is interference only if the different wave functions\nare detected coherently. Coherence means that there is a precise phase difference of the\ndetection process between the arrival times of the different wave functions that must be\ntaken into account. When the second wave packet arrives, the detection process is already\nexcited with a frequency due to its interaction with the first wave packet and its phase is\ndetermined by the time difference between the arrivals of the two wave packets. It is easy\nto see [15] that the phase of the detection process cancels exactly the phase difference of the\ntwo wave functions due to the different detecting times, leading to the practical prescription\nto calculate the interference of different wave functions at the same time and the same space\npoint.\nLet us now apply the wave packet formalism to neutrino oscillations, following the lines\npresented in Refs. [16, 17]. The Gaussian wave packets that describe massive neutrinos in\none spatial dimension x along the source-detector direction are\n#\n\"\n\u0010\u221a\n\u0011\u22121/2\n(x \u2212 vk t)2\n\u03c8k (x, t) =\n,\n(26)\n2\u03c0 \u03c3xP\nexp i pk x \u2212 i Ek t \u2212\n2\n4\u03c3xP\n\nwhere \u03c3xP is the width of the wave packets, that is determined by the production process, Ek\nand pk are, respectively, the energy and momentum of the neutrino with mass mk , related\nby the relativistic dispersion relation (3), and vk is the group velocity given in Eq. (2).\n5\n\n\fTaking into account the possibility that the detection process has a finite coherence time\ninterval \u03c3tD and a finite spatial coherence width \u03c3xD , we describe the detection process of\nthe massive neutrino \u03bdk with the Gaussian wave packet\n#\n\"\n(x \u2212 L)2 (t \u2212 T )2\n\u2212\n,\n(27)\n\u03c8Dk (x, t, L, T ) \u221d exp i pk (x \u2212 L) \u2212 i Ek (t \u2212 T ) \u2212\n2\n2\n4\u03c3xD\n4\u03c3tD\nwhere L is the source-detector distance and T is the time elapsed between neutrino production and detection. Notice that with respect to the wave packet (21), in Eq. (27) we have\nconsidered also a finite spatial coherence width of the detection process that was neglected\nin the discussion of the double-slit experiment. On the other hand, with respect to the wave\npacket treatment of neutrino oscillations presented in Ref. [17] we have added the explicit\nterms that take into account the finite coherence time interval \u03c3tD of the detection process.\nThe frequency and wave number of the detection process are the same as those of the\ndetected massive neutrino wave function, which excites the corresponding degree of freedom\nof the detection process. In the framework of quantum field theory the detection process is\ndescribed in terms of the leptonic weak charged current\nX X\n\u0001\nj \u03bc (x) =\n\u03b1(x) \u03b3 \u03bc 1 \u2212 \u03b3 5 U\u03b1k \u03bdk (x) ,\n(28)\n\u03b1=e,\u03bc,\u03c4\n\nk\n\nwhere U is the lepton mixing matrix (see [18\u201321]). Only the field \u03bdk (x) is excited by the\narrival of the wave function of the corresponding massive neutrino \u03bdk , and the frequency and\nwave number of the field excitations are the same as those of the incoming wave function.\nThe amplitude of detection of each massive neutrino wave packet is given by the overlap\nof the incoming neutrino wave packet with the detection process wave packet:\nZ\n\u2217\n(x, t, L, T ) \u03c8k (x, t) .\n(29)\nAk (L, T ) \u221d dx dt \u03c8Dk\nPerforming the integration over x and t we obtain\n\"\n\n(L \u2212 vk T )2\nAk (L, T ) \u221d exp i pk L \u2212 i Ek T \u2212\n2\n4\u03c3xk\n\n#\n\n,\n\n(30)\n\nwith\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\u03c3xk\n\u2261 \u03c3xP\n+ \u03c3xD\n+ vk2 \u03c3tD\n.\n\n(31)\n\nThis result is simple and important. It shows clearly that the coherent absorption of each\nmassive neutrino wave function occurs in a space-time interval of width \u03c3xk around the\ncoordinates L, T of the detection process. The size of this space-time interval is determined\nby the width of the neutrino wave packet and the coherence spatial and temporal widths of\nthe detection process. The largest width dominates. The contribution of the temporal width\nof the detection process is weighted by the velocity of the incoming neutrino wave packet\nfor obvious reasons. Since this velocity depends on the mass of the neutrinos, the width \u03c3xk\n6\n\n\fdepends on the index k labeling massive neutrinos. However, for relativistic neutrinos the\ncontribution of neutrino mass to \u03c3xk is negligible and we can safely approximate\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\u03c3xk\n\u2243 \u03c3xP\n+ \u03c3xD\n+ \u03c3tD\n\u2261 \u03c3x2 .\n\n(32)\n\nNotice that, on the other hand, the contribution of neutrino mass to the other terms in\nEq. (30) cannot be neglected because it is amplified by the macroscopic quantities L and T .\nIn the following we use the relativistic approximation, which implies that\nEk \u2243 E + \u03be\n\nm2k\n,\n2E\n\npk \u2243 E \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03be)\n\nm2k\n,\n2E\n\nvk \u2243 1 \u2212\n\nm2k\n,\n2E 2\n\n(33)\n\nwhere E is the neutrino energy in the limit of zero mass. The first order correction to\nthe momentum and energy due to neutrino mass mk is proportional to m2k because of the\nrelativistic dispersion relation (3), and must be divided by the energy E for dimensional\nreasons. The coefficient \u03be depends on the production process, but we will see that it has no\neffect on the phase of neutrino oscillations, as already shown in Refs. [15\u201317].\nThe probability of flavor transitions is given by (see [18\u201321])\nP\u03bd\u03b1 \u2192\u03bd\u03b2 (L, T ) \u221d\n\nX\n\n2\n\u2217\nU\u03b1k\n\nAk (L, T ) U\u03b2k\n\n,\n\n(34)\n\nk\n\nwhere U is the lepton mixing matrix. Performing the average of P\u03bd\u03b1 \u2192\u03bd\u03b2 (L, T ) over the\nunmeasured neutrino propagation time T , we finally obtain\n\uf8ee\n!2 \uf8f9\n2\nX\nX\n\u2206m\nL\nL\nkj\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\uf8fb,\nU\u03b1k\nU\u03b2k U\u03b1j U\u03b2j\nFkj exp \uf8f0\u2212i\n|U\u03b1k |2 |U\u03b2k |2 + 2 Re\nP\u03bd\u03b1 \u2192\u03bd\u03b2 (L) =\n\u2212\ncoh\n2E\nL\nkj\nk>j\nk\n\n(35)\n\nwhere\nLcoh\nkj\nare the coherence lengths and\n\n\u221a\n4 2 E2\n\u03c3x\n=\n|\u2206m2kj |\n\n\uf8ee\n\nwith the oscillation lengths\n\nFkj = exp \uf8f0\u22122\u03c0 2 \u03be 2\nLosc\nkj =\n\n\u03c3x\nLosc\nkj\n\n4\u03c0 E\n.\n|\u2206m2kj |\n\n(36)\n\n!2 \uf8f9\n\n\uf8fb,\n\n(37)\n\n(38)\n\nThe coherence length Lcoh\nkj is the distance beyond which the contributions of the massive\nneutrinos \u03bdk and \u03bdj do not interfere any more because the separation between their wave\npackets is larger than the size of the wave packets and the spatial and temporal coherence\nwidths of the detection process. The coefficient Fkj suppresses the interference of \u03bdk and \u03bdj\nif \u03c3x & Losc\nkj , i.e. if the production or the detection process is not localized in a space-time\n7\n\n\fregion much smaller than the oscillation length. This obvious constraint for the observation\nof neutrino oscillations was discussed for the first time in Ref. [22] and is satisfied in all\nexperiments. Therefore, in practice one can safely approximate Fkj \u2243 1.\nFrom Eq. (35) one can see that a proper wave packet treatment of neutrino oscillations\nthat takes into account the different propagation times of massive neutrino wave packets leads\nto the standard oscillation phase (1), refuting the disagreement of a factor of two claimed in\nRefs. [3,4]. Neutrino oscillations are due to the different phase velocities of different massive\nneutrinos, which produces interference. This interference is obviously the same whether it\nis calculated in the plane wave approach or in the wave packet treatment. The different\nconclusion reached in Refs. [3, 4] is due to a wrong use of the group velocity in the phase.\nIn conclusion, using an analogy with the well-known double-slit experiment we have\nshown that the standard phase (1) of neutrino oscillations is correct, refuting the claim of\na factor of two correction presented in Refs. [3, 4]. We have also improved the wave packet\ntreatment of neutrino oscillations presented in Refs. [16, 17], taking into account explicitly\nthe finite coherence time of the detection process.\n\nReferences\n[1] M. Beuthe, (2001), hep-ph/0109119.\n[2] C. Giunti, M. Laveder, and M.
