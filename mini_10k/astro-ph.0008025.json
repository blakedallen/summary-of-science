With the detection of the edge-on debris disk in \u03b2 Pictoris (Smith and\nTerille 1984), and the equally important discovery that the debris exhibited a silicate emission\nband whose structure was similar to solar system comets (Knacke et al. 1993) it was apparent that\n1\n\nVisiting Astronomer, NASA Infrared Telescope Facility, operated by the University of Hawaii under contract\nwith the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\nat least some of these systems might be true planetary systems, perhaps similar to what our own\nsolar system was like in its youth. Since that time, disks and tori around other stars have been\nsuccessfully imaged.\nRecently, Kastner et al. (1997) identified a previously unrecognized nearby young stellar association that consisted of 5 T Tauri (TT) or T Tauri-like stars, including the classical TT star TW\nHya. Designated as the TW Hya Association (TWA), the list of objects in this stellar group is now\nover a dozen objects and growing (Webb et al. 2000). Located at a distance of about 50 pc, TWA\nrepresents the nearest region of recent (<20 Myr) star formation. It is no longer embedded in a\nmolecular cloud, yet one of its members, TW Hya itself, possesses both a circumstellar molecular\ncloud (CO, HCN, and CN have been detected; Kastner et al. (1997)) and an infrared excess. HR\n4796A, which is also believed to be a member of TWA (Webb et al. 2000) has a dusty torus that\nhas been recently resolved (Jayawardhana et al. 1998; Koerner et al. 1998; Schneider et al. 1999).\nAnother member of TWA is HD 98800, a multiple star system with dust concentrated around one\nunresolved pair (Gehrz et al. 1999; Koerner et al. 2000). Combining a variety of criteria, Weintraub\net al. (2000) derive an age of 5-15 Myr for TWA.\nBecause TWA is the nearest group of pre-main sequence stars known, it is providing imaging\npossibilities that are in some ways superior to that of the Taurus-Auriga complex, and at an epoch\nof great importance to the study of planet formation. This association provides a laboratory for\nstudying a number of stars of the same age but different masses, multiplicities, etc. Although the\nluminosities of low-mass stars in TWA are substantially less than those of younger stars of the\nsame mass (such as in Taurus-Auriga), the relative proximity of the TW Hya association and the\nimplementation of sensitive IR array detectors on large telescopes opens up a realm of study of\nPMS disk evolution not possible before.\nIn this paper we report observations of the 3-13 \u03bcm spectra of TW Hya, HR 4796A, and HD\n98800. The mid-IR spectrum of HD 98800 has already been reported by Sylvester and Skinner\n(1996) using ground-based data, and by Walker and Heinrichsen (2000) using ISOPHOT. Our\ndata extends to shorter wavelengths than the Sylvester & Skinner data, while having a better\nsignal-to-noise ratio than the ISOPHOT observations. Both are useful for realistically determining\nthe photospheric contribution to the observed emission.\n\n2.\n\nOBSERVATIONS\n\nSpectra of the TWA targets were obtained with the Aerospace Corporation's Broadband Array Spectrograph System (BASS) configured to f/35 at the 3m NASA Infrared Telescope Facility\n(IRTF). The BASS consists of a pair of cooled prisms which disperse the spectrum onto two 58element blocked impurity band (BIB) linear arrays that simultaneously span the 3-13.5 \u03bcm region.\nThe spectral dispersion ranges from about 30 to 125 over each of the 3-6 and 6.5-13.5 \u03bcm regions.\nAt the IRTF, the BASS entrance aperture subtends 3.4 arcsec. The observations of TW Hya were\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nobtained on 21 March 1998 (UT). HD 98800 was observed on 8 February 1998 (UT). HR 4796A\nwas observed on 12 May 1998 (UT).\nDetails of the observations are listed in Table 1, and the resultant spectra are shown in Figures\n1 (TW Hya), 2 (HD 98800), and 3 (HR 4796A), where we have plotted the spectral flux (\u03bbF\u03bb in\nW m\u22122 ). All BASS spectral data points such as those in the atmospheric CO2 and H2 O bands\nwith errors exceeding the observed flux (i.e., signal/noise less than unity) have been rejected. The\nspectrum of TW Hya was flux-calibrated using observations of \u03b1 CMa (Sirius) at approximately\nthe same airmass, obtained just prior to the TW Hya data. The spectrum of HD 98800 was\ncalibrated using observations of \u03b1 Boo (Arcturus) at the same airmass, and converted to the same\nflux system using the Arcturus/Sirius flux ratio determined by Russell and Mazuk (1998) for the\nBASS instrument. For HR 4796A, no calibrator at the same airmass were observed. To establish\nthe spectrum, it was calibrated against one star, \u03b1 Lyr (Vega) at a lower airmass, and another star,\n\u03b2 Gem (Pollux) at higher airmass. For the latter, we also used the Pollux/Sirius ratio of Russell\nand Mazuk (1998). Outside of those wavelengths that are severely affected by telluric lines, and\nwhich are usually rejected from the figures due to their inferior signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), the\nresultant fluxes are nearly identical. We illustrate this fact by plotting both resultant spectra in\nFigure 3. Because of the similarity of these spectra, we have taken the mean values and plotted\nthem against the appropriate model atmosphere spectrum in Figure 4. The detail near the 10 \u03bcm\nband is shown in Figure 5.\n\n3.\n\nDiscussion of the Spectra of Individual Objects\n3.1.\n\nTW Hya\n\nFigure 6 shows the spectral energy distribution of TW Hya from 0.44 to 100 \u03bcm. The photometric data in the 12, 25, 60, and 100\u03bcm bands were obtained by IRAS. In addition, measurements\nin the B, V, R, I, J, H, K, and L photometric bands by (Ruchinski and Krautter 1983) are included. Because TW Hya is a variable star, we show the mean value of the Rucinski and Krautter\nmeasurements, while the error bars indicate the range in those values. We also show the Kurucz\nmodel photosphere spectrum of a K7 V star, normalized to the K and L-band flux.\nAs can be seen in Figure 6, TW Hya possesses a significant infrared excess. In fact, the\nemission longward of 8 \u03bcm, which is dominated by the thermal emission of the circumstellar dust,\naccounts for 23% of the total observed luminosity of the star. Originally, Ruchinski and Krautter\n(1983) fit the data at 1.25 \u03bcm and shortward with a blackbody spectrum, which left a flux excess\nbetween 1.25 and 3.5 \u03bcm. However, model atmospheres of stars in this temperature range have line\nopacities that naturally reproduce the shape of the spectrum observed in this region. In Figure 6\nwe illustrate this by fitting a Kurucz model atmosphere of a K7 star, and normalize it to the 2-4\n\u03bcm BASS data. The same model fit is included in Figure 1. The fit is not perfect down to the\nshortest wavelength, but TW Hya is a variable star, the BASS data are not simultaneous with the\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\n\nFig. 1.- The spectrum of TW Hya (filled circles) from 3-14\u03bcm, along with the L-band data of\nRuchinski and Krautter (1983) (open triangle, barely visible amongst the BASS data), and the\nIRAS 12 \u03bcm data. No adjustments to the flux levels of any of the data have been made. For\ncomparison, we also show the K7 model atmosphere (T=4000 K, log g=4.5, log z=0.0). The\nmodel spectrum was generated using the 1991 Kurucz models, reproduced using the IUEDAC's\nKURUCZ91.PRO routine, and normalized to the L-band data of Rucinski and Krautter.\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\n\nTable 1.\n\nObserving Parameters\n\nDate (UT)\n\nStar\n\nMean UT\n\nMean Airmass\n\nNumber of Spectra\n\nInt.

In any\ncase, there does not appear to be any significant excess flux between 2 and 8 \u03bcm.\nIn TW Hya (see Figure 1) the emission between 8 and 13 \u03bcm is dominated by the silicate band\nat 10 \u03bcm. The three points between 9.5 and 9.8 \u03bcm with the large error bars lie in the telluric\nozone band and may not be reliable, even though the data on TW Hya were obtained at the same\nairmass as that of Sirius. The point at 9.4 \u03bcm with the smaller error bar sits right at the edge of\nthis band.\n\n3.2.\n\nHD 98800\n\nThe spectrum of HD 98800 between 3 and 13.5 \u03bcm is shown in Figure 2. Also shown in the\nfigure are the photometric data of Zuckerman and Becklin (1993) and Koerner et al. (2000). The\nagreement between absolute fluxes derived from the BASS data and the other two sets is good,\nalthough the BASS fluxes are slightly lower. The shape and total flux level is also the same as\nthe spectral data obtained by Sylvester and Skinner (1996), whose observations cover the 8-24 \u03bcm\nregion, and who used the photometry from another instrument in their modeling. The value of the\nBASS observations are that they cover the wavelength regions dominated by both photospheric\nand dust emission simultaneously and on the same photometric system, allowing the photospheric\nflux to be extrapolated out into the 10 \u03bcm region using a single set of simultaneous data. The\nISOPHOT observations of Walker and Heinrichsen (2000) cover the 5.8-11.6 \u03bcm region, but suffer\nfrom such large systematic fluctuations in the signal that the silicate feature cannot even be seen.\nThe BASS spectrum shortward of 6 \u03bcm is well-fit by the photospheric model normalized near\n3 \u03bcm. This is consistent with the results of Koerner et al. (2000), who fit similar models to the\nindividual A and B components of the system (each of which is a binary), and find that the flux is\ndominated by photospheric emission out to 7 \u03bcm in both A and B components.\n\n3.3.\n\nHR 4796A\n\nIn Figures 4 and 5 we show the spectrum of HR 4796A and its appropriate model atmosphere.\nThe 8-13.5 \u03bcm flux is weak, and half is photospheric. Koerner et al. (1998), using thermal imaging\nwith the MERLIN instrument on Keck, derive a total flux at 12.5 \u03bcm of 5.4x10\u221214 Wm\u22122 , of which\nit was estimated that half was photospheric. For the BASS observations, the 12-13 \u03bcm flux is higher\nthan those derived from MERLIN, but the fraction due to photospheric emission is comparable.\nThe lack of any detectable excess flux shortward of 8 \u03bcm indicates that there is little dust hotter\nthan 450 K or closer than about 2 AU (depending somewhat on the optical albedo and infrared\nemissivity of the grains). Augereau et al. (1999) have modeled the spectral energy distribution of\nHR 4796A, including the hot inner region, with a 2-component dust model. In their model, the\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nexcess emission near 10 \u03bcm comes primarily from huge (larger than 100 \u03bcm in size) grains located\nnear 9 AU from the star. Unfortunately, the quality of the spectra here are inadequate the detailed\nspectral features expected from such material.\n\n4.\n\nCOMPARISON WITH SOLAR SYSTEM COMETS AND OTHER DUSTY\nPMS STARS\n4.1.\n\nGeneral Considerations\n\nSome main sequence and pre-main sequence stars with dusty debris disks possess silicate grains\nwhose spectral features resemble those of long-period comets. Knacke et al. (1993) were the first\nto demonstrate this by comparing the 10 \u03bcm emission feature in \u03b2 Pic with 1P/Halley and Levy\n1990 (C/1991 L3). All three objects exhibit an emission band with maxima or shoulders near 9.5\n\u03bcm and 11.2 \u03bcm, the latter indicative of crystalline olivine. Subsequently, HAEBEs embedded in\nstar-forming regions have been examined (i.e. Hanner et al. (1995)) and some, such as HD 150193\nin the \u03c1 Oph cloud, are found to possess features of a similar nature. The two isolated HAEBEs\n(which might also be called post-HAEBEs since they no longer embedded in nebulosity) HD 31648\nand HD 163296, were shown to have spectra similar to that of Hale-Bopp and Levy (Sitko et al.\n1999). However, the stellar disk dust in these systems emitted relatively more strongly near 9.4\n\u03bcm than the comets.\nIt should be remembered that in the case of a comet, we are dealing with material with a single\nwell-defined distance from the sun, while this is not the case for a disk. Nevertheless, Wooden et al.\n(2000) have shown that over a range of a factor of three in heliocentric distance, the spectral shape\nof Hale-Bopp was, with the exception of one subfeature, invariant. Furthermore, a comparison of\nthe ISO spectra of the HAEBE star HD 100546 and Hale-Bopp indicate that, while the overall\nspectral energy distributions are significantly different in the way expected (more cool dust in the\nstellar disk), the shapes of the narrow features were still quite similar (Malfait et al. 1998). However,\nthe shape of the 10 \u03bcm band is sensitive to the abundance and form of pyroxenes, as evidenced\nin the variety of spectral shapes of pyroxene-rich interplanetary dust particles (IDPs) that have\nbeen analyzed in the laboratory (Sanford and Walker 1985; Bradley et al. 1992). It is interesting\nthat the one subfeature that was observed to vary with heliocentric distance in Hale-Bopp has\nbeen attributed to crystalline pyroxenes (Wooden et al. 2000). This suggests that perhaps the\nmain reason for the excess 9.4 \u03bcm emission of the disks compared to comets is due to the presence\nof dust at temperatures much higher than those generally observed in solar system comets, which\nallows the crystalline pyroxenes to be enhanced, but on a grander scale than was seen in Hale-Bopp.\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\n4.2.\n\nTW Hya\n\nIn Figure 7 we show the 10 \u03bcm band of TW Hya, normalized to the continuum by dividing\nby a gray body that matches the observed flux at 8 and 13 \u03bcm. Also shown are the data for HD\n31648, HD 163296, comet Hale-Bopp, and comet Levy from Sitko et al. (1999). Although the data\nfor TW Hya has a modest SNR, it is apparent that TW Hya does not have the same shape as the\nother objects. In particular, the well-defined crystalline olivine feature seen at 11.2 \u03bcm in both the\ncomets and HD 31648 and HD 163296 seems to considerably less-defined in TW Hya. At best, a\nmodest change of spectral slope is present at that wavelength. In Figure 8 we compare the spectrum\nof TW Hya with three HAEBEs (Sitko et al. 2000) whose emission features are representative of the\nwide variety that are seen in these PMS objects (excluding objects dominated by organic emission\nfeatures). That of RY Tau exhibits a silicate feature which is strong and relatively featureless,\nexcept for a single maximum near 9.7 \u03bcm. In HD 163296 (again) the olivine feature is present, but\nnot as prominent as in comets such as Hale-Bopp and Levy. Finally, the spectrum of HD 35187\nhas a weak silicate band, but more comet-like (flat-topped) in shape. In Figure 9 we also compare\nthe spectrum of TW Hya to that of RW Aur, a PMS G5e star with circumstellar CO emission in\nthe first vibrational overtone band (Sitko and Hanson 2000). Because the strength of the silicate\nband with respect to the underlying continuum in RW Aur is only one-quarter that of TW Hya, for\ncomparison purposes the band strength with respect to the continuum in RW Aur has been scaled\nup by a factor of 4.\nOf the four \"comparison\" star, the silicate band in TW Hya is most similar in shape and\nstrength to that of RY Tau, a F8Ve PMS star in the Taurus-Auriga cloud. The spectral shape in\nthe silicate band of TW Hya is also nearly identical to that of RW Aur (G5e), but its strength is\nconsiderably stronger. This should not be construed to imply that TW Hya and the other latetype PMS stars are systematically different from the earlier-type HAEBEs. Most HAEBEs are not\nstrong 11.2 \u03bcm emitters. Furthermore, high-quality mid-IR spectra on a large sample of TTs are\nlacking.\nIn Figure 10 we show the flux/continuum ratio of HD 98800 with that of TW Hya. While the\ntwo sets of data overlap reasonably well between 11 and 13 \u03bcm, much of this may simply be due to\nthe normalization procedure used to get the flux/continuum ratio. Overall, the band strength seems\nto be weaker in HD 98800, and there may be structural differences as well. However, when the band\nstrength is intrinsically weak, the normalization procedure tends to magnify the systematic effects\nin the data (such as small errors in cancellation of telluric lines between target and calibration star)\nso that spectral \"features\" may not be real. In such cases, a direct comparison of the observed\nfluxes may be more useful. In Figure 11 we compare the observed fluxes of these two stars directly\n(after suitable re-scaling). Here, the differences are more readily apparent.\nDue to the weakness of the dust emission in HR 4796A compared to the extrapolated photospheric flux, the flux/continuum ratio was not determined.\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\n\nFig. 7.- The flux/continuum ratio for TW Hya (filled circles) compared to those of HD 163296\n(upper thin line), HD 31648 (lower thin line), Comet Hale-Bopp (upper thick line) and Comet Levy\n(lower thick line).\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\n\nFig. 8.- The flux/continuum ratio for TW Hya (filled circles) compared to that of HAEBEs with\na wide variety of spectral shapes: HD 163296 (solid line), HD 35187 (dashed line) and RY Tau\n(dot-dashed line).\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\n\nFig. 9.- The flux/continuum ratio of TW Hya (filled circles) compared to that of RW Aur (solid\nline).

In this figure, the flux of HD 98800 has been scaled down by a\nfactor of 3.5, and that of HR 4796A by a factor of 4.5.\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\n5.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nIn Figure 11 we compare the spectra of all three stars, normalized to the same flux between\n3 and 5 \u03bcm, where all three are dominated by photospheric emission. It is apparent that the net\nstrength of the silicate emission feature of the dust surrounding the three TWA stars is different,\nand it cannot simply be the result of differing ages, since the stars are believed to be approximately\ncoeval. Thus the degree to which small silicate grains survive and/or are modified in these systems\nmust be dependent on other parameters as well, such as stellar mass, presence and location of\ncompanions, and the like. With only three TWA stars observed so far, it is premature to draw\nany specific conclusions in this regard. Furthermore, the quality of the spectra of the dust in HR\n4796A and HD 98800 preclude any sweeping generalizations concerning their detailed mineralogies.\nInstead, we examine some of the inferences that can be made concerning the general nature of the\nmaterial surrounding TW Hya specifically.\nThe 11.2 \u03bcm crystalline olivine feature has not been detected with the ISO Short Wavelength\nSpectrometer (SWS) in the emission spectra of the youngest (i.e. embedded) PMS stars, but is\nseen observed in a number of more evolved objects (Waelkens et al. 2000). Because the majority\nof the objects observable with ISO SWS must be bright, most of the targets have been HAEBEs.\nThe TTs were too faint for SWS (van den Ancker 2000). Only a few were observed at more\nmodest spectral resolution with ISOPHOT (see Natta et al. (2000)), but much of these data have\ninadequate signal-to-noise to make any conclusions regarding the presence of crystalline material.\nThe dust in TW Hya itself does not appear to exhibit the degree of crystallinity, as judged by\nthe strength of the 11.2 \u03bcm olivine feature, that some other objects with resolved debris disks have,\nand which is seen in many, but not all, solar system comets (Hanner et al. 1994). For example,\nin the HAEBE star HD 163296, a star whose age is believed to be between 4 and 6 Myr, the\nfeature is definitely present (Sitko et al. 1999; van den Ancker et al. 2000). About half (or more) of\nlong-period comets studied so far also possess the 11.2 \u03bcm feature. These comets have their recent\norigin in the Oort cloud, and were presumably originally formed in the Uranus-Neptune region of\nthe early solar system. By contrast, short-period comets, whose origin is probably in the Kuiper\nbelt, tend to have weaker silicate features (Lynch et al. 1992, 1995, 2000; Hanner et al. 1996). The\nmean particle sizes must be greater (or the feature otherwise hidden in some fashion) in these latter\nobjects, and the degree of crystallinity cannot be assessed.\nWhen does the crystalline material form in these disk systems, if at all? Bradley et al. (1999)\nhave demonstrated that the most primitive unequilibrated interplanetary dust particles, of presumed cometary origin, exhibit a smooth silicate band essentially devoid of crystalline features.\nThis is consistent with their glassy internal structure. The spectra of these particles resemble\nthose of disk systems that do not exhibit the 11.2 \u03bcm feature. However, the large porous grains\nin which they are embedded, along with significant amounts of crystalline material, have spectra\nwhich resemble those older disk systems and solar system comets that do exhibit this crystalline\nfeature. It may be that much of the crystalline material is produced early in the development of the\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\nprotosolar nebula, and is later agglomerated with the more pristine material (Bradley et al. 2000).\nOne could even envision a scenario whereby disk or comet dust shed and heated near the star is\nrecycled over the entire lifetime of the formation of the bulk of the cometesimals in the nebula. In\nsuch a scenario, \"pristine\" objects might be highly \"contaminated\" by dust processed at a variety\nof temperatures.\nThe lack of the feature in TW Hya, whose age is greater than that of some other stars exhibiting\nthe feature, could be due to a number of factors. Perhaps it is simply too young, and hasn't entered\nthe stage where this material is produced. We simply do not have enough data on lower-mass stars\nto know for sure if they are slower than the higher-mass stars in entering this phase (and not all of\nthem do, to the best of our knowledge). Or perhaps the material is currently not being delivered\nclose enough to the star yet for the material to emit strongly. In addition, the sheer volume of space\nsurrounding the higher-mass stars that is capable of thermally processing grains is larger than in\nlower-mass stars.\n\n6.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe have presented 3-13 \u03bcm spectra of three stars in the TW Hya Association: TW Hya,\nHR 4796A, and HD 98800. TW Hya possesses a strong silicate emission band that is generally\nsimilar in strength and shape to many other pre-main sequence stars, such as the Herbig Ae/Be\nstars (HAEBEs) and T Tauri stars (TTs). However, the feature does not show the unambiguous\npresence of crystalline material, as evidenced by the 11.2 \u03bcm feature, as is observes in some HAEBEs\nand in some long-period solar system comets. HR 4796A has only a very weak excess emission above\nphotospheric levels, and nothing can be said about the presence of a significant silicate band from\nthese data. HD 98800 is intermediate between these two in terms of the strength of its silicate\nband, but the data are inadequate to say anything about the mineralogy or degree of crystallinity.\nFor the object where we have the best data, TW Hya, the lack of obvious crystallinity is not\nentirely surprising, as it is absent in all of the youngest pre-main sequence stars, and in most but\nnot all of the older ones. It is present in many of the long-period comets of our own solar system,\nhowever, and our failure to detect it so far in a younger star of roughly solar mass is intriguing,\nthough not unexpected. We are far from understanding how the crystalline material is produced\nand incorporated into the grains of our own solar system and in the disk systems of some of the\nhigher-mass stars.\nOne of the main obstacles preventing more definitive conclusions is the lack of high-quality\nmid-IR spectra of TTs. Many can be reached using ground-based instruments, but require long\n(in excess of an hour or two) integration times to achieve the necessary signal-to-noise. A truly\ncomprehensive study will require an instrument like the Space Infrared Telescope Facility (SIRTF).\nSupport for this work was provided for MLS through NASA's Origins of Solar Systems Program\ngrant NAG5-9475, and the University Research Council and Physics Department of the University\n\n\f\u2013 20 \u2013\nof Cincinnati.
