Introduction\nIn 1970, Askhkin [1] first demonstrated the optical trapping of particles using the radiation\nforce produced by the focused continuous-wave (CW) Gaussian beam. Since then the optical\ntrapping or tweezers has become a powerful tool for manipulating dielectric particles [2, 3],\nbiological cells [4-7], and neutral atoms [8, 9].\nUsually optical trapping or tweezers in many experiments are constructed by using the\nCW laser. It is well known that the CW laser, with the power of a few milliwatts, can only\nproduce the radiation force with an order of a few pN to manipulate the micro-sized particles.\nRecently, Ambardekar et al. [10] and Deng et al. [11] used a pulsed laser to generate the large\ngradient force (up to 100pN) within a short duration (~45\u03bcs) for overcoming the adhesive\ninteraction between the particles and the surface. Little et al. [12] and Agate et al. [13] have\nmade a comparison between the femtosecond and the CW optical tweezers, and have pointed\nout that femtosecond optical tweezers are as effective as CW optical tweezers.\nHowever, there is no any investigation about \"how does the pulse duration affect on the\nradiation force acting on a Rayleigh particle?\" The radiation forces as electromagnetic forces\nhave been discussed in detail [14, 15]. In this paper, we have derived the analytical\nexpressions for the longitudinal and transverse components of the radiation force under the\nRayleigh approximation. Based on the derived formula, we analyze the effect of the pulse\nduration on the physical manipulating impact on the micro-sized particles. At last, we show\nthe stability conditions for effective manipulating the particles.\n\nFig. 1. Schematics of a pulse laser radiating on a particle.\n\n2. Radiation force induced by a pulsed Gaussian beam\nAs shown in Fig. 1, a paraxial pulsed Gaussian beam is radiating on a dielectric sphere. The\npolarization direction of the pulsed electric field is assumed to be along the x direction. The\nexpression for the electric field of the paraxial pulsed Gaussian beam is given by\nv\nE ( \u03c1 , z , t ) = x\u02c6E ( \u03c1 , z, t )\n= x\u02c6\n\niE0\n(kw0 ) 2 \u03c1 2\ni 2kz\u03c1 2\n(t \u2212 z / c) 2 (1)\nexp[i\u03c90t \u2212 ikz \u2212\n\u2212\n] exp[\u2212\n],\n2 2\n2\n2\n2 2\n2\ni + 2 z / kw0\n(kw0 ) + 4 z\n(kw0 ) + 4 z\n\u03c42\n\nwhere w0 is the beam waist at the plane z = 0 , \u03c1 is the radial coordinate, x\u0302 is the unit\nvector of the polarization along the x direction, k = 2\u03c0 / \u03bb is the wave number, \u03c4 is the\npulse duration, and \u03c90 is the carrier frequency. Eq. (1) is applicable under the narrow-spectral\ncondition that the pulse spectrum width (proportional to 1 / \u03c4 ) is much smaller than \u03c90 . For\n\n2\n\n\fthe fixed input energy U of a single pulsed beam, the constant E0 is determined\nby E 02 = 4 2U /[n 2 \u03b5 0 cw02 (\u03c0 ) 3 / 2 \u03c4 ] , where c = 1 /(\u03b5 0 \u03bc0 )1 / 2 is the light speed in vacuum, \u03b5 0\nand \u03bc0 are the dielectric constant and permeability in the vacuum, respectively, and n2 is the\nrefractive index of the surrounding medium. The corresponding magnetic field under the\nparaxial approximation can be given by\nv\nH ( \u03c1 , z , t ) \u2245 y\u02c6 n2\u03b5 0 cE ( \u03c1 , z , t ) ,\n(2)\nhere we have neglected the z component of the magnetic field under the paraxial\napproximation. The pulse intensity or irradiance is defined as a time-averaged Poynting vector:\n~ 2\nv\nv\n2 \u03c1~ 2\nP\n~ z kw0 2\nI ( \u03c1 , z , t ) \u2261< S ( \u03c1 , z , t ) >T = z\u02c6I ( \u03c1 , z , t ) = z\u02c6\nexp[\u2212\n] exp[\u22122( t \u2212\n) ], (3)\n2\n2\n~\n~\nc\u03c4\n1 + 4z\n1 + 4z\n~\nwhere P = 2 2U /[(\u03c0 ) 3 / 2 w02\u03c4 ] , and ( \u03c1~, ~\nz , t ) = ( \u03c1 / w0 , z / kw02 , t / \u03c4 ) are normalized temporal\nspatial coordinates, and \u1e91 is the unit vector in the beam propagating direction.\nFor the sake of simplicity, we assume that the radius a of the particle is much smaller\nthan the wavelength of the pulse, i. e., a << \u03bb . In this case, the Rayleigh approximation is\napplicable and the dielectric particle can be seen as a point dipole. Under\nv this approximation,\nfor the CW laser, the radiation force includes the scattering force Fscat and gradient force\nv\nv\nFgrad , where Fgrad arises from the inhomogeneous field distribution [14, 17]; for the pulse,\nv\nFgrad is a part of the ponderomotive force. In a dilute medium (without dipole-dipole\nv\ninteraction), the ponderomotive force Fp is simply the Lorentz force [14, 16-17]:\nv\nv\nv\nv\nv\nv\nv\nFp ( \u03c1 , z, t ) = [ p( \u03c1 , z, t ) \u22c5 \u2207]E ( \u03c1 , z, t ) + [\u2202 t p( \u03c1 , z, t )] \u00d7 B( \u03c1 , z , t ) = Fgrad + Ft ,\n(4)\nv\nv\nwhere p = \u03b2E is the dipole moment, \u03b2 = 4\u03c0n22\u03b5 0 a 3[(m 2 \u2212 1) /( m 2 + 2)] is the polarizability of a\nspherical particle in the Rayleigh regime, and m = n1 / n2 (here n1 is the refractive index of the\nparticle). Obviously, for the CW\nv in Eq. (4) is always zero. In our case,\nv laser, the second term\nfor the short pulse, except for Fgrad , the second term Ft of Eq. (4) may also play an important\nrole for manipulating the small particles. Substituting Eqs. (1) and (2) into Eq. (4), we can\nobtain all components of the ponderomotive force as follows:\nv\nFgrad , \u03c1 = \u2212 \u03c1\u02c6 2 \u03b2 I ( \u03c1 , z , t ) \u03c1~ /[cn2\u03b5 0 w0 (1 + 4~\nz 2 )] ,\n(5a)\n~\n2\n4\n2\n2\n2\n~\n~\n~\n~\nv\n2 \u03b2I ( \u03c1 , z, t ) z k w0 k t w0 2 z (1 + 4 z \u2212 2 \u03c1 )\n(5b)\nFgrad , z = \u2212 z\u02c6\n+\n[ 2 2 \u2212\n],\nc\u03c4\nn2\u03b5 0 ckw02\nc\u03c4\n(1 + 4~z 2 ) 2\nv\n~\nFt = \u2212 z\u02c68\u03bc0 \u03b2I ( \u03c1 , z , t ) t / \u03c4 + z\u02c68~\nz \u03bc0 \u03b2 I ( \u03c1 , z , t ) kw02 /(c\u03c4 2 ) ,\n(5c)\nv\nwhere \u03c1\u0302 is the unit vector of the radial direction. For Fscat , it is proportional to light\nintensity and is along the + z direction [17],\nv\nv\nFscat ( \u03c1 , z, t ) = C pr < S ( \u03c1 , z , t ) >T /(c / n2 ) = z\u02c6 (n2 / c)C pr I ( \u03c1 , z, t ) ,\n(6)\n\nwhere C pr = (8\u03c0 / 3)(ka) 4 a 2 [(m 2 \u2212 1) /(m 2 + 2)]2 is the cross section of the radiation pressure\nof the spherical particles in the Rayleigh regime. From Eqs. (5) and (6), wev find that the\nv\nmagnitude of the radiation forces, especially for the longitudinal components Fgrad , z and Ft ,\nis greatly affected by the pulse duration \u03c4 . From Eqs. (5a) and (5b), both the transverse and\nlongitudinal components of the gradient force act as the restoring forces pointed towards the\npulse center for the particle with m > 1 although the magnitude of these forces will be\nchanged with different \u03c4 . In the following, we find that whether there is a stable trapping\n\n3\n\n\fv\nstrongly depends on the duration \u03c4 because Ft is strongly affected by \u03c4 . For smaller \u03c4 , the\nsecond term of Eq. (5c) can be greatly increased in manner of 1 / \u03c4 2 .\n3. Numerical simulation and analysis\n\nWithout loss of generality, in all our simulations we choose the following parameters [18]:\n\u03bb =0.514\u03bcm, m = n1 / n2 = 1.592 / 1.332 (for example, the small glass bead and water),\nw0 = 1 \u03bcm, a = 5 nm, and the input pulse power is fixed to be U = 0.1 \u03bcJ.\n\nFig. 2. The temporal evolutions of (a-c) the transverse and (e-f) the longitudinal radiation\nforces for the pulses with different durations: \u03c4 = 1 ps for (a) and (e), \u03c4 = 0.1 ps for (b)\nand (f), \u03c4 = 0.01 ps for (c) and (g). (d) and (h) show the dependence of both the maximal\ntransverse and longitudinal radiation forces on the duration \u03c4 , respectively.\n\nFig. 3. The dynamic distributions of (a-c) the longitudinal and (d-e) the transverse\nradiation forces for the pulses with duration \u03c4 = 1 ps at different times: t = \u22120.5\u03c4 for (a)\nand (d), t = 0 for (b) and (e), and t = 0.5\u03c4 for (c) and (f).\n\nFirst, let us see the temporal evolution of the radiation force acting on the small particle.\nFigures 2(a), 2(b), and 2(c) plot the dynamic evolution of the transverse radiation force. It\nshows that there is a trapping region in the transverse direction, and the maximal transverse\nradiation force is enhanced as \u03c4 decreases [see Fig. 2(d)]. Figures 2(e), 2(f) and 2(g) plot the\nv\nv\nv\nv\ndynamic evolution of the longitudinal radiation force, Fz = Fscat + Fgrad , z + Ft , i.e., all forces\nv\nalong the z axis. As \u03c4 becomes small, the maximal | Fz | also increases greatly [see Fig.\nv\n2(h)], and the dynamic behavior of F z changes dramatically from stably to unstably along the\n\n4\n\n\fz axis. Therefore, for the pulse with large \u03c4 , the force is determined by the gradient force,\nwhich forms a stable\nv trappingv region at the pulse center; in this situation, the gradient force is\nmuch larger than Fscat and Ft , thus it is very similar to the case of the CW laser [2, 17-20].\nFor the pulse with small \u03c4 , although the transverse radiation force provides the restoring force\nto pull the particle back to the stable point on the z axis, the longitudinal radiation force will\nmake the particle accelerate and decelerate along the + z direction.\n\nFig. 4. The dynamic distribution of (a-e) the longitudinal and (f-j) transverse radiation\nforces for the pulse with \u03c4 = 0.1 ps at different times: t = \u22120.2\u03c4 for (a) and (f), t = \u22120.1\u03c4\nfor (b) and (g), t = 0 for (c) and (h), t = 0.1\u03c4 for (d) and (i), and t = 0.2\u03c4 for (e) and (j).\n\nFig. 5. The dynamic distribution of (a-c) the longitudinal and (d-f) transverse radiation\nforces for the pulse with \u03c4 = 0.01 ps at different times: t = \u22120.2\u03c4 for (a) and (d), t = 0 for\n(b) and (e), and t = 0.2\u03c4 for (c) and (f).\n\nNow we turn to discuss how the pulse duration affects on the distribution of the radiation\nforce. Figure 3 shows the dynamic distributions of the transverse and the longitudinal\nradiation forces acting on the Rayleigh dielectric sphere for the pulse with \u03c4 = 1 ps at different\ntimes. It is clear that for the pulse with larger \u03c4 , the radiation force has a stable trapping\nregion, which is located near the focused center of the pulse and the trapping is enhanced as\nthe pulse arrives at the focused center z = 0 . Therefore in this case the pulse may trap and\nmanipulate the micro-sized particles as effectively as the CW laser [12, 13]. With the\ndecreasing of the pulse duration, see Fig. 4, the stable trapping region becomes small and the\ntrapping time becomes short, although the transverse force still provides the restoring force in\nthe transverse direction. For the pulse with very short duration, from Fig. 5, although the pulse\n\n5\n\n\fcannot be used as an optical trap to manipulate the small particle, it may be used to accelerate\nthe particle because (i) during the first half pulse, the particle will be confined around the z\naxis and be accelerated along the + z axis, and (ii) during the other half pulse, although the\nparticle will be decelerate it still moves along the + z axis. It also should be noticed that the\nmagnitude of the radiation force are greatly enhanced for the short pulse (also see Fig. 2). In\nthis sense, the pulsed beam may be used to accelerate and levitate the particle for overcoming\nthe van der Walls force from the surface of the vessel [10, 11].\n4. Conditions for the stable manipulation\n\nIn the above discussion, our analysis shows that the radiation force of the pulsed beam may be\nused to manipulate the Rayleigh dielectric sphere. In order to know whether the particle could\nbe effectively controlled by the pulse, first we estimate the potential well induced by the\nradiation force. The potential well must be deep enough to overcome the kinetic energy of the\nparticle due to thermal fluctuation. The condition can be given by using the Boltzmann factor\nr\n[2, 8]: Rthermal = exp(\u2212U max / k BT ) << 1 , where U max = \u03c0\u03b5 0 n12 a 3 | (m 2 \u2212 1) /( m 2 + 2) | \u22c5 | E |2max is\nthe maximum of the potential well, k B is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the absolute\ntemperature of the ambient. In the above numerical examples, for the pulse with \u03c4 = 1 ps, we\nobtain Rthermal \u2248 0.68 in the room temperature of 300 K. As \u03c4 decreases, Rthermal becomes\nsmaller and smaller, e. g., Rthermal \u2248 0.02 for \u03c4 = 0.1 ps, and Rthermal \u2248 3.9 \u00d7 10\u221217 for\n\u03c4 = 0.01 ps. Therefore the Brownian motion could be overcome or ignored and the particles\ncan be manipulated by the radiation force of the pulsed beam with short duration.\nSecond, we consider the effect of the random diffusion of the small particle in the\nsurrounding medium. As we know that during the interval of two pulses, the radiation force\nvanishes, and the particle moves under the gravity and the Brownian force. If the particle\ndoesn't move out the trapping region during the pulse interval, then the radiation force of the\nsecond pulse can drag it back to the stable trapping region or manipulate the particle again. In\nour case, the density of the small glass bead is assumed to be 2.4 \u00d7 10 3 kg/m3, then the gravity\nof the particle is about 1.2 \u00d7 10 \u221220 N , which is much smaller than the radiation force, therefore\nthe effect of the gravity can be ignored for the small particle with a = 5 nm. When a particle\nmoves freely inside the ambient, it suffers the Brownian motion. From the Stokes-Einstein\nrelation, the diffusion coefficient is D = k BT /(6\u03c0\u03b7a) , where the viscosity for water is\n\n\u03b7 = 7.977 \u00d7 10 \u22124 Pa \u22c5 s at T = 300 K. Therefore we obtain D \u2248 5.5 \u00d7 10 \u221211 m2/s for a = 5 nm. If\nthe pulse repetition rate is larger than 100Hz, the particle diffuses into an area about\n0.55 \u00d7 10 \u221212 m2 during the pulse interval. This diffusion area is smaller than the acting range\nof the radiation force. Therefore the particle could be effectively confined within the\nmanipulating region of the pulsed beam.\n4. Conclusion\n\nIn summary, we have theoretically investigated the dynamic radiation force produced by the\npulsed Gaussian beam acting on a Rayleigh dielectric particle. We find that the radiation force\nof the pulse can increase greatly as the pulse duration decreases. For the pulsed beam with\nlarge pulse duration, it can be used for stable trapping and manipulating the particle; for the\npulsed beam with short pulse duration it may be used for guiding and moving the small\ndielectric particle. Finally the conditions for effective trapping and manipulating the particle\nhave been analyzed.\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 10604047),\nand Scientific Research Foundation of Zhejiang Province (G80611 and G20630).\n\n6\n\n\f"}
