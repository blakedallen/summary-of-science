Introduction\nThe environment of radio quiet active galactic nuclei (AGN)\nis still poorly understood. The activity is powered by a black\nhole but the accretion flow is accompanied by an outflow of the\nmaterial. The inflow is in a form of an accretion disk which,\nfurther out, has a form of a dusty/molecular torus and the radial\nvelocities of the inflow are not measured directly. The outflow\ntakes place in a large range of angles around the symmetry axis\nbut the geometry and the nature of this flow is unclear. The\npresence of the outflow manifests best as Broad Absorption\nLines (BAL) of optical/UV spectra of some quasars, Narrow\nAbsorption Lines (NAL) in other quasars or in Seyfert galaxies,\nor as X-ray warm absorbers (WA) in Seyfert galaxies. These\nabsorption features allow to determine the outflow velocity of\nthe plasma along the line of sight but any estimates of the spatial distribution of the plasma, or even of a representative distance of the absorber from the nucleus, are difficult.\nOne of the important questions is whether this outflow is\nroughly a continuous wind with shallow density gradient or\nSend offprint requests to: loic.chevallier@obspm.fr\n\na highly clumpy medium with very dense clouds embedded\ninto low density surrounding plasma. The model of a continuous wind was proposed by Murray & Chiang (1995) and\nsubsequently studied e.g. by Murray & Chiang (1997, 1998),\nProga, Stone & Kallman (2000, 2004), Pietrini & TorricelliCiamponi (2000). On the other hand, the strong X-ray irradiation of the outflowing material may lead to thermal instability\n(Krolik et al. 1981) thus resulting in clumpiness of a part of the\nflow. Therefore, clumpy outflow was advocated by a number\nof authors (e.g. Smith & Raine 1988; Netzer 1993; Krolik &\nKriss 1995; Netzer 1996). A narrow stream of clumpy outflow\nwas advocated for by Elvis (2000), while narrow continuous\nstreamers were favored by Steenbrugge et al. (2005). Recently,\nan advanced model of the clumpy outflow was developed by\nChelouche & Netzer (2005), based on the previous extensive\nstudies of the wind acceleration mechanisms.\nThe issue can be in principle solved directly on the observational grounds. However, X-ray data even from grating instruments on board of Chandra or XMM-Newton telescopes cannot\nresolve kinematical components narrower than \u223c 100 km s\u22121 .\nHigh resolution UV data show the presence of absorption lines\n\n\f2\n\nChevallier et al.: Response of the warm absorber cloud to variable nuclear flux in AGN\n\nwith the kinematical widths \u223c 100 km s\u22121 (e.g., NGC 3783,\nGabel et al. 2003) or 50 \u2212 60 \u223c 100 km s\u22121 (e.g., NGC 7469,\nScott et al. 2005). These results are consistent with X-ray data\nbut it is still not clear whether we probe the same part of the\nflow with X-ray and UV data. Spectral analysis of the X-ray\ndata suggests that one zone model does not well represent the\nobservations and at least two photoionization regions are required to explain the presence of lines from the gas in different\nionization states (NGC 4051, Collinge et al. 2001; NGC 5548,\nKaastra et al. 2002; NGC 3783, Kaspi et al. 2002, Netzer et\nal. 2003 and Krongold et al. 2003; Mkn 304, Piconcelli et al.\n2004; H0557-385, Ashton et al. 2006).\nOn the theoretical side, it is not clear whether strong\nclumpiness of the medium is possible to achieve and sustain.\nTime evolution of the warm absorber medium has not been\nstudied in great detail so far. Additionally, AGN are known\nfor their variability in the X-ray band since the EXOSAT data.\nVariable irradiation changes the conditions within the cloud\nand might even destroy the cloud. Also small compact cloud\nwill respond to variable X-ray flux in a different way than an\nextended medium.\nIn the present paper we concentrate on a single warm absorber cloud under constant pressure. We consider a cloud of\nconsiderably large column density and non-negligible optical\ndepth. Such a cloud is strongly stratified since the density profile is obtained self-consistently from the condition of total\npressure equilibrium (see Dumont et al. 2002, Chevallier et al.\n2006, R\u00f3\u017ca\u0144ska et al. 2006), inducing a few sharp temperature\ndrops due to thermal instabilities. Magnetic and turbulent pressure effects have been neglected in this study. It is well known\nthat magnetic pressure may remove the thermal instabilities\n(Bottorff, Korista & Shlosman 2000), but our cloud, if large\nenough, will still remain highly stratified with a shallower temperature and density gradient near the location of the previous\nthermal instability zone. It is the same with turbulent pressure.\nBright irradiated side of the cloud is of low density and highly\nionized but the density strongly increases inward (by a few orders of magnitude) and the medium becomes less ionized as we\napproach the dark side of the cloud. Such a medium has been\nused to fit the WA of NGC 3783 (Gon\u00e7alves et al. 2006). Here\nwe study the response of the cloud to the varying X-ray flux,\nwith the aim to test the possibility of strong clumpiness in the\nwarm absorber. Using the time-independent code, we estimate\nthe evolution of our cloud at the basis of timescales, determined\nseparately in different parts of our highly stratified cloud. The\ncloud, initially in total (gaseous + radiative) pressure equilibrium, is disturbed; pressure is no longer constant, and various\nparts of the cloud expand/contract. We estimate the observational consequences of the cloud departure from equilibrium.\nFinally we show how the behavior of our cloud, whose distance\nfrom the central source is unknown, vary with this distance.\nIn the next section, we recall some generalities about the\nmodel and our photoionization code, and we give formulae for\ntimescales which are detailed in the Appendix. Results are presented in Sect. 3. Section 4 is dedicated to the discussion of the\nphysical and observational implications of these models.\n\n2. Model\nWe study the response of a single warm absorber cloud to a\nchange of the incident X-ray radiation flux, F. Using the stationary radiative transfer code, we determine the kinds of equilibrium solutions:\n\u2013 total pressure and thermal equilibrium,\n\u2013 only thermal equilibrium.\nThe first type of solution is the cloud in total pressure equilibrium. It corresponds to a cloud which is in complete equilibrium with the incident flux. The second type of solution is\nobtained allowing for a change in the irradiating flux but assuming that the timescale of this change, tX , is shorter than the\ntimescale needed to restore the pressure equilibrium. In this\ncase we perform the computations of the new thermal and ionization equilibrium but we retain the original density profile.\nThis second solution will describe the cloud out of pressure\nequilibrium. The applicability of either the first, or the second\nsolution depends on the cloud location and the variability properties of the nucleus.\nThe radiative transfer used in both cases is the code TITAN\n(Dumont et al. 2000, 2003). This 1-D code works in planeparallel symmetry but uses the Accelerated Lambda Iteration\n(ALI) method to provide fully-consistent multi-angle radiative\ntransfer computations for both continuum and lines (Rybicki &\nHummer 1991, and references therein). Using an accurate radiative transfer method is important in such a problem, where\nradiation pressure variation within the cloud plays an important\nrole, especially in the determination of the location of temperature drops due to thermal instabilities. We consider about 1000\nspectral lines, mainly in the X-ray range of the 10 most abundance species in the universe, i.e. H, He, C, N, O, Ne, Mg,\nSi, S and Fe. Throughout the paper we use cosmic abundances\n(Allen 1973), which are constant in the cloud.\nThe complete equilibrium state is characterized by the local\ndensity at the irradiated face of the cloud, no , the hydrogen column density of the cloud, NH , and the properties of the incident\nradiation (a power-law of index 1 from 10 eV to 100 keV, and\nthe ionization parameter \u03be = L/no R2 , where L is the bolometric\nluminosity of the source, R the distance of the medium from the\nsource). The density profile is determined consistently from the\ncondition of the total pressure equilibrium. The off-equilibrium\nstate is characterized by a new value of the ionization parameter\n\u03be but the density profile is taken from the previous equilibrium\nsolution.\nWe first analyze the timescales for various processes\nwithin the cloud in full equilibrium, in order to establish selfconsistency of the cloud response.\nThe light travel time is given by\ntlight =\n\nH\n,\nc\n\n(1)\n\nwhere H is a geometrical size of a whole cloud, or of a zone\nunder consideration. In our case this timescale is relevant since\nthe cloud is optically thin to the continuum. This low (but not\nnegligible) optical depth is caused by significant ionization of\nthe medium even at the dark side of the cloud.\n\n\fIf the irradiation changes, the whole volume of the cloud\nresponds to the decrease/increase in photon flux. Therefore,\ngenerally we do not have here well defined ionization fronts,\nas in the case of an expanding HII region around a star (e.g.\nOsterbrock 1974). The relevant description is provided, instead, by the ionization and recombination timescales. The ionization tion and recombination trec timescale for each ion is\na local quantity within a cloud. However, we can introduce\ntimescales for specific zones, or a whole cloud, by analyzing\nwhich ions dominate in the various zones and which transitions are close to equilibrium (see the Appendix).

The initial configuration (i.e. the variation of all quantities in optical\ndepth scale) practically does not depend on no (with values between 105 to 1012 cm\u22123 ; see R\u00f3\u017ca\u0144ska et al. 2006) for a given\n\u03be and NH . Since a change of the local density at the illuminated\nsurface of the cloud is equivalent to a change of distance R\nfrom the nucleus we can take our cloud as representative for a\nwhole family of self-similar clouds at various distances. So our\nmodel can be applied to several distances R, with appropriate\ndependence of no on the radius R. We have F(R) \u221d R\u22122 , T as\nthe function of the hydrogen column remains the same, independently from the distance, and n scales with no . We request\nno (R) \u221d R\u22122 , thus H(R) \u221d R2 . Consequently all timescales defined in this section are proportional to R2 .\n\nFig. 1. The temperature profile of the cloud at the initial state\n\u03be = 104 erg cm s\u22121 (red). We also represent the case more\ntypical of WA: log \u03be = 3, for which maximal column-density\nis 2 \u00d7 1023 cm\u22122 (magenta). This curve is shifted in columndensity by a value 1023 cm\u22122 in order to compare with the\nlog \u03be = 4 case. Curves are not distinguishable.\n\n3. Results\n\n3.1. Initial state of the cloud\nWe model first the cloud in complete total pressure equilibrium.\nFor this reference cloud, we choose \u03be = 104 erg cm s\u22121 , no =\n107 cm\u22123 . We choose the largest NH \u223c 3 \u00d7 1023 cm\u22122 allowed\nfor the constant pressure cloud for such an incident spectrum\n(Chevallier et al. 2006). This choice of the column-density is\nconsistent with computations of the cloud sizes by TorricelliCiamponi & Courvoisier (1998), which take into account the\nthermal conduction. If we apply their expression for the cloud\ncore scaling (Eq. 5), taking their cloud dimensionless size x =\n3 \u00d7 107 from their Figs. 4 and 5, and take the core temperature\n3 \u00d7 104 K (i.e. the smallest temperature in our reference cloud),\nwe obtain the expression for the column-density of the cloud\nNH \u223c 2\u00d71023 cm\u22122 , independent from the core number density.\nThe internal kinematics is set as random Gaussian movements\nwith dispersion 100 km s\u22121 , whose only effect is to increase the\nline width by Doppler effect.\nThe temperature profile across the cloud as a function of\nthe hydrogen column-density measured from the cloud surface\nis shown in Fig. 1. For such abundances, electron density is\nne \u223c 1.18 nH and total density is n \u223c 2.265 nH ). The cloud\ndevelops four characteristic zones:\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\u2013\n\nlow density high temperature extended zone (hot),\nintermediate zone (intermediate),\nhigh density low temperature outer zone (outer),\nthin zone of highest density and lowest temperature (end).\n\nThe last zone is geometrically very thin, as can be seen in\nTable 1 but the hydrogen column density of this zone is significant because of the high density. For the considered cloud, the\nratio of densities at the cold and hot surfaces is \u223c 103 , whatever the value of density no between 105 and 1012 cm\u22123 . The\ngeometrical size of the reference cloud is 5 \u00d7 1015 cm, smaller\n\n\fChevallier et al.: Response of the warm absorber cloud to variable nuclear flux in AGN\n\nby a factor of 6 than for a constant density cloud with the same\ncolumn density and the same density at the cloud surface. The\nlight travel time across the cloud is 1.7 \u00d7 105 s. The typical\nvalue of \u03be of warm absorbers, estimated from the observational\ndata, is rather \u223c 1000 or lower, and such values are met in\nthe interior of our reference cloud (i.e. intermediate zone, see\nTable 1) where the density is roughly ten times the density\nat the surface of our medium. Figure. 1 confirms that models with log \u03be = 3 and 4 behave similarly. For our log \u03be = 3\nmodel, NH \u223c 2 \u00d7 1023 cm\u22122 , which is now the maximum column density. In order to compare these temperature profiles,\nwe have shifted the solution for log \u03be = 3 by 1023 cm\u22122 along\nthe column-density axis. Temperature profiles are almost the\nsame, apart that the intermediate zone for the log \u03be = 3 case is\n25% less than for the log \u03be = 4 case.\nAs ionization or recombination timescales are specific of\neach ion, we analyzed the ionization structure of a whole\ncloud (see the Appendix and Table 3). The longest ionization timescale is equal to 8 \u00d7 103 s (for ion Fexxvi in the hot\nzone). Processes representative for the intermediate, outer and\nend zones are connected with Sxvi, Oviii and Cvi, respectively.\nThe representative recombination timescale for a whole cloud\nis 2 \u00d7 104 s (again for Fexxvi in the hot zone). Representative\nions for the recombination timescale in the intermediate, outer\nand end zones are Sixiv, Oix and Cvii, respectively.\nThe profiles of the timescales calculated locally across\nthe cloud are shown in Fig. 2. We see that photoionization\ntimescale is roughly constant through the slab but the recombination timescale is monotonically decreasing through the cloud\nsince it is inversely proportional to the electron density ne according to the scaling formula (see Eq. 3). The actual recombination timescale calculated numerically across the cloud (see\nthe Appendix) depends also on the temperature (not linearly)\nand decreases even faster. The recombination timescale is more\nshallow if we consider various ions as representative for different zones (see Table 1).\nThe overall thermal timescale depends both on the temperature and the density, so it decreases with the distance from\nthe cloud surface even more rapidly than the recombination\ntimescale (see Table 1), and roughly follows the numerically\nobtained recombination timescale for a single ion. Its maximum value of 107 , at the hot surface, is very high, much longer\nthan ionization or recombination timescales. We have checked\nthat \u039b23 \u223c 1 whatever the depth for our model, including the\nsurface layers. In other zones the thermal timescale is shorter,\nso most ions reach equilibrium in the timescale appropriate for\nthe intermediate zone (2 \u00d7 105 s), and we adopt this value as the\nlongest characteristic thermal timescale of the cloud. However,\nwe must stress that in the case of the hot zone, where highly\nionized iron spectral features form, the full thermal equilibrium\nis hard to achieve. The temperature rises/falls slowly since both\nthe atomic heating/cooling and the Compton heating/cooling\nare not very efficient. The dynamical timescale of the whole\ncloud obtained through integration is equal 2 \u00d7 108 s. Both in\nthe hot and in the intermediate zone these timescales, calculated separately, are long (see Table 3). In Fig. 2 we plot the\ncumulative timescales for each of the zones separately, starting\nfrom the beginning of a zone.\n\nhot\n3.4 1015\n5.8 1022\n8.0 106\n1.7 107\n370\n1.2 105\n6 103\n2 104\n107\n9.3 107\n\n\u2206z [cm]\ncol.

The dependence of the various local timescales (s)\nacross the cloud (as a function of the column-density): ionization timescale, recombination timescale, thermal equilibrium timescale, hydrostatic equilibrium timescale (cumulative\nthrough the slab, classical perfect gas). As ionization or recombination timescales are specific of each ion, we choose to\nrepresent Fexxvi, which represent the longest timescale (only\nin the hot zone for recombination, leaders are Sixv, Oix and\nCvii for the intermediate, outer and end zones, respectively; see\nTables 1 and 3).\n\n3.2. Cloud states and conditions for the\nself-consistency of the cloud response description\nThe X-ray flux of AGN nuclei is strongly variable. Since the\ntimescales corresponding to ionization/recombination equilibrium and to the dynamical equilibrium differ by a few orders of\nmagnitude, a cloud is not always likely to achieve a complete\nequilibrium. We will now analyze the conditions of complete,\nor partial equilibrium.\nFor this purpose, we must compare the cloud internal\ntimescales with the timescales of the intrinsic variability of the\nX-ray incident flux. AGN do not have any specific timescales\nbut the power spectrum in Seyfert galaxies is well represented\nby a power law with the two breaks (e.g. Markowitz et al.\n2003). Most of the power is between the high and the low fre-\n\n\fIn our reference cloud the second set of conditions is\nroughly fulfilled. The ionization and recombination timescales\nare short for all important transitions. The thermal timescale in\nthe intermediate zone is comparable to tXshort , only the thermal\ntimescale in the hot zone is significantly longer which may effect the hydrogen-like iron absorption feature. The shortest dynamical timescale in the last zone is still longer than tXshort , so\nthe model is appropriate for short timescale variability. Longer\n= 107 s, should be folsystematic trends, like those in tlong\nX\nlowed by computing new pressure equilibrium at the back side\nof the cloud, in the outer and end zones but retaining the old\ndensity profile in the hot and intermediate zone. We postpone\nthe computations of such hybrid models for the future.\nSummarizing, our new equilibrium is fully self-consistent\nfor an increase in the X-ray flux lasting up to tX = 3 \u00d7 105 s\n(i.e. the shortest dynamical timescale, see Table 1) if the density\nprofile is left unchanged. Results obtained for longer timescales\ncan only serve as indicators of the trends.\n\n3.3. Response of the cloud structure to the change of\nirradiation flux\nWe therefore compute a set of new cloud equilibrium solutions\nby increasing the incident flux and preserving the density profile from the pressure equilibrium state described in Sect. 3.1.\nFigure 3 shows the temperature profiles of the cloud for which\nthe increase of flux is by a factor 3, 10 and 100. Naturally, an\nincrease in the X-ray flux results in a higher surface temperature. The depth of the first, hottest zone does not change but\nthe temperature of the intermediate zone rises. An increase in\nX-ray flux by a factor 100 removes the intermediate zone completely. The two last colder zones always exist although for the\nhighest irradiation flux the temperature of the back side of the\ncloud rises up to 106 K. However, the rise of the incident flux\nby a factor of 3 already brings up the temperature of the outer\nzone almost close to the temperature of the intermediate zone.\n\n10\n\n8\n\n10\n\n7\n\n10\n\n6\n\n10\n\n5\n\n10\n\n5\n\nx4\nx4.5\nx5\nx6\n\n4\n\n0\n\n5e+22\n\n1e+23\n\n1.5e+23\n\n2e+23\n\n2.5e+23\n\n3e+23\n\n-2\n\nColumn-density [cm ]\n\nFig. 3.

For all those cases, we have neglected\nthe turbulent pressure.\n1\n0.9\n0.8\n0.7\n-2\n\nThe full thermal and pressure equilibrium within the cloud\nis achieved if the light crossing time, the longest of the ionization, recombination or thermal timescales, the dynamical time\nof the cloud are much shorter than the shortest X-ray variability\ntimescale, i.e. max(tlight , tth , tion , trecomb , tdyn ) \u226a tX .

Response of the cloud velocity field to the change\nof irradiation flux\nAfter the change in the incident flux, the cloud is not in\nthe pressure equilibrium any more. Pressure gradients appear\nwhich lead to local acceleration of the gas within the cloud and\nsubsequent expansion. Figure. 4 shows the gaseous, radiative\nand total pressure for the initial state log \u03be = 4 and the final\nstate log \u03be = 4.5. The most prominent feature is the huge positive pressure gradient at the transition between the intermediate\nand outer zones. Therefore, a shock may form at this location\nas the material strain to recover the dynamical equilibrium. It is\nnot a classical ionization front since the whole cloud is in a new\nionization equilibrium after a relatively short time tion . This is a\ndifferent type of shock which forms due to the presence of the\ndensity gradient in the original model, previously supported by\nthe appropriate temperature gradient. This support is removed\n\n\fChevallier et al.: Response of the warm absorber cloud to variable nuclear flux in AGN\n\n3.5. Clouds at various distances from the nucleus\nThe choice of no = 107 cm\u22123 and \u03be = 104 corresponds to the\nchoice of the distance for a specific choice of the bolometric\nluminosity L of the nuclear source. The domain of observed\nluminosities range form 1041 erg s\u22121 (e.g., NGC 4051) up to\n1047 erg s\u22121 (e.g., quasars). We adopt L = 1045 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 in\nthe further calculations: the cloud is located at the distance of\n1017 cm from the nucleus. All those results scale as L/R2 , and\nany value of L can be chosen.\nThe results obtained for a single cloud can be generalized to\na family of clouds located at various distances from the nucleus\nadopting scaling laws based on the very weak dependence of\nthe results for the radiative transfer on the adopted value of the\nnumber density at the cloud surface, no (see Sect. 2).\nWe have checked the underlying assumption by calculating\na set of clouds for \u03be = 104 erg cm s\u22121 , NH = 3 \u00d7 1023 cm\u22122\nand with values of no in the range from 105 to 1011 cm\u22123 . The\ntemperature profiles measured as functions of the optical depth\nwere almost identical. The density profiles as functions of the\noptical depth had very similar shape and differed just in the\nnormalization. The ratio of the density at the outer edge of the\ncloud to no was almost constant, only slowly decreasing from\n1.5 \u00d7 103 to 103 with the increasing density.\nTherefore, at the basis of the numerical results for a single cloud we consider now a family of clouds for \u03be =\n104 erg cm s\u22121 , NH = 3 \u00d7 1023 cm\u22122 , and the bolometric luminosity of the nucleus L = 1045 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 . The condition\nof constant \u03be in this case implies that the number density at the\n7\n\u22123\ncloud illuminated surface is no (R)/R\u22122\n17 = 10 cm , where R17\n17\nis the distance in units of 10 cm, and it is by a factor of 103\nhigher at the dark surface. Other quantities defined in Sect. 2\nbecome H(R)/R217 = 5 \u00d7 1015 cm, tlight (R)/R217 = 1.7 \u00d7 105 s,\ntion (R)/R217 = 8.0 \u00d7 103 \u2212 30 cm, trec (R)/R217 = 2 \u00d7 104 \u2212 20 s,\ntth (R)/R217 = 2 \u00d7 105 \u2212 60 s, and tdyn (R)/R217 = 108 \u2212 4 \u00d7 105 s.\nUsing these expressions and a variability timescale of the\nsource between 105 s and 107 s, we can estimate the kind of\nequilibrium reached by our medium as a function of the dis-\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\n\n9\n\n10\n\n8\n\n10\n\n7\n\n10\n\n6\n\n10\n\n5\n\n10\n\n4\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\n1\n\n10\n\n0\n\nlong\n\ntX\n\nshort\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n-2\n\n10\n\ntX\n\nl\n\nica\n\nina\n\nb\nom\n\nc\n\nRe\n\nt\n\ngh\nLi\nal\n\nerm\n\nTh\n\nn\n\ntio\n\niza\n\nIon\n\n14\n\nn\n\ntio\n\nam\n\nn\nDy\n\nCurrent model\n\nby the sudden rise of the temperature on the cold side. Since\nthe discontinuity in the total pressure is not very large (a factor of 1.25 in case of the flux rise by a factor 3, see Fig. 4)\nthe expected Mach number, M, of an isothermal shock is low\n(M2 = 1.25), a relatively weak shock forms and propagates\nwith a speed close to the speed of sound Mc s \u223c 120 km s\u22121 in\nthis zone, as we only have to consider the highest temperature\nT \u223c 7 105 K ahead the thermal instability zone (see Fig. 3).\nSubsonic motions due to the lack of pressure balance will also\nappear in other parts of the cloud.\nDue to the very different values of the velocity in our cloud,\nwe thus expect that lines forming in these transition zones may\nhave a very complex profile: part of the line may be narrow, and\npart of the line profile may be broad. The presence of the significant velocity gradient means that the assumption of a constant\nturbulence across the cloud may not be justified but the computations of the radiative transfer with variable velocity field is\nbeyond the scope of the present paper.\n\nTimescales (s)\n\n6\n\n10\n\n15\n\n10\n\n16\n\n17\n\n10\nDistance R (cm)\n\n10\n\n18\n\n10\n\n19\n\n10\n\n20\n\nFig. 5.

The results are shown in Fig. 5, where several regions,\nas a function of the distance of our cloud from the nucleus, can\nbe defined.

Note that those results depend only on the\nvalue of the ionization parameter, \u03be, and the cloud column density, NH , and this figure can be scaled with various values of the\nluminosity L.

Discussion\nIn this paper we have considered the complexity of the response\nof the warm absorber to the variable X-ray incident flux. In order to assess the cloud response we mostly concentrated on\ncomparison of two states of a single warm absorber cloud: an\ninitial irradiated cloud at pressure equilibrium, and a cloud suddenly irradiated by a three times higher flux i.e. that cloud could\nreach new thermal and ionization equilibrium under enhanced\nirradiation but the time was too short to reach new pressure\nequilibrium. The model can be used against the presently available and future observational data.\nBelow we give a few exemplary applications of our representative cloud results, not yet focused at fitting a specific object. More precise modeling should use a family of solutions.\n\n4.1. Observational applications\n4.1.1. Soft X-ray variability\nEnhanced irradiation leads to higher ionization of the cloud and\nlower opacity, particularly in the soft X-ray band. Indeed, observations based on RXTE monitoring show an enhancement\nof the energy-dependent fractional variability amplitude below\n5 keV (Markowitz et al. 2003). Best studied case of a Seyfert 1\ngalaxy MCG-6-30-15 shows enhanced variability in 0.2\u20134 keV\nband approximately equal to 30% (Fabian et al. 2002, Ponti et\nal. 2004). The variability below 0.2 keV and above 5 keV must\nbe intrinsic, as it reflect the changes in the level (and possibly slope) of the continuum but the excess 0.2\u20134 keV may be\ndue to the opacity changes in the warm absorber (e.g. Sako et\nal. 2002). Such an effect on this object has been studied using\nconstant density clouds (Gierlinski & Done 2006).\nUsing our density-stratified clouds, we have calculated the\nratio of the two spectra (models with log \u03be = 4 and log \u03be = 4.5).\nSince the change of the flux by a factor 3 is rather extreme as\ncompared to the observed variability in MCG-6-30-15, we only\nconsider the model with log \u03be = 4.1 (i.e. increase of \u223c 26% of\nthe incident flux) without adjustment of the pressure and another one with log \u03be = 4.1 in constant pressure equilibrium.\nIn Fig. 6 we show the ratios of the two spectra plotted with\nthe resolution usually used from the computation of the fractional variability amplitude. We also show the fractional variability amplitude calculated from one of the data sets obtained\nfor MCG-6-30-15 (XMM observation in 2000, rev. 303; see\nGoosmann et al. 2006). Indeed, there is a strong enhancement\nof the variability at 1\u20132 keV. The maximum value of 50% of the\nfractional variability for the log \u03be = 4.1 case is close from the\nMCG-6-30-15 case. This suggests that the variable ionization\nof the warm absorber is a promising contributor to the overall variability. If so, such enhanced variability in the soft X-ray\n\n50\nMCG-6-30-15\nx4.1\nx4.1 pressure equilibrium\n45\n\nFractional Variability [%]\n\ntime-dependent computations of the radiative transfer, with the\nadopted light-curve, are appropriate to analyze such clouds,\nand at present we are unable to perform such computations.\nFor the last group of very distant clouds, the cloud size is so\nextended that the assumption of a single cloud breaks down\nand we deal with an extended continuous wind.\n\n7\n\n40\n\n35\n\n30\n\n25\n\n20\n200\n\n500\n\n1000\n\n2000\n\n5000\n\n10000\n\n15000\n\nhnu [eV]\n\nFig. 6. The fractional variability amplitude (here in %, defined\nas 2|F1 \u2212 F2 |/(F1 + F2 )) calculated using the log \u03be = 4 spectrum\nas a reference, for two models of increasing flux to log \u03be = 4.1,\nthe first one as described in this study and the second one in total pressure equilibrium. Those quantities are shown for a wide\nenergy range: 200 eV to 15 keV. Some difference is seen in\nthe width of the horizontal zone between 1 and 2 keV, and for\nthe features around 7 keV (iron K\u03b1 line region). Spectral resolution is 10 (Gaussian shape). The overall level of the amplitude reflect the assumption about the increase in the flux but the\nenergy-dependent features can be compared to the features in\nthe observed fractional variability amplitudes. The exemplary\ndata points represent a 100 ksec XMM observation of MCG-630-15 (Goosmann et al. 2006).\nband peaking at 1 keV should be seen only in the sources which\nshow the presence of the warm absorber. Our model shows\nslightly too much absorption for this data set, and a better fit\nwould be reached with a lower column-density, for the same\nvalue of \u03be. It is also interesting to point out that the fractional\nvariability enhancement obtained without the pressure equilibrium extends more into high energies, and seems to fit better\nthe data. This would suggest the warm absorber distance larger\nthan 3 \u00d7 1015 cm since the medium had no time to reach the\ndynamical equilibrium (see Sect. 3.5).\n\n4.1.2. Observational determination of the column\ndensity\nAn interesting trend was found of increasing equivalent column density of the absorber with an increase of the ionization\nparameter for the species (NGC 5548, Steenbrugge et al. 2005;\nNGC 4051, Ogle et al. 2004; NGC 7469, Scott et al. 2005). It is\ntherefore interesting to see whether such a trend is explained by\nour constant pressure clouds. Therefore, we selected the ions\nstudied by Scott et al. (2005) and performed a similar analysis, i.e. we used the ion column densities from our simulations\n(for the initial cloud and the cloud with increase irradiation,\nout of pressure equilibrium) and inverted them to equivalent\nhydrogen column using only abundance values. The results are\nshown in Fig. 7. We see that the trend seen in the data is in a\nnatural way explained by our model. The ratio of almost five\n\n\f8\n\nChevallier et al.: Response of the warm absorber cloud to variable nuclear flux in AGN\n24\nx4\nx4.5\n\nNe IX\n\nO VII\n\n22\n\nSi XIII\nNe X\nMg XI\n\nMg XII\nFe XX\n\nO VIII\n\nO VI\n\nlog(NH)\n\nWavelength\n\nabsorption\n\nzone\n\nmodel\n\nmeasured\n\nA\n6.18..\n6.65...\n8.42...\n9.17...\n11.55...\n12.13...\n12.28...\n12.82...\n13.45..\n15.01...\n\nline\nSixiv\nSixiii\nMgxii\nMgxi\nNeix\nNex\nFexxi\nFexx\nNeix\nFexvii\n\nintermed\nintermed\nintermed\nintermed/outer\nouter\nintermed/outer\nintermed\nintermed\nouter\nouter\n\n[km/s]\n150\n150\n150\n150\n60\n150\n150\n150\n60\n60\n\n[km/s]\n620 \u00b1 690\n1350 \u00b1 900\n500 \u00b1 160\n680 \u00b1 410\n1020 \u00b1 520\n430 \u00b1 270\n890 \u00b1 570\n1070 \u00b1 340\n1050 \u00b1 490\n650 \u00b1 320\n\nSi XIV\n\nFe XXI\nFe XVII\n\nNV\n20\nC IV\n\n18\n\n16\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\nlog(U)\n\nFig. 7. Equivalent hydrogen column-density vs. ionization parameter for some ions selected in our reference cloud in its\ninitial state (log \u03be = 4) and width the increased illumination\n(log \u03be = 4.5). Apparent systematic increase reproduces the\ntrend seen in the data of Scott et al. (2005).\n\norders of magnitude between the results for Fexx, Mgxii, Sixii,\nSixiv and Civ is well explained by the model out of dynamical\nequilibrium. On the other hand, our column densities are lower\nthan these obtained by Scott et al. (2005). Extensive modeling\nwith the use of other cloud parameters will be necessary to see\nwhether the specific values characteristic for NGC 7469 can be\naccommodated within our model.\n\n4.1.3. Line widths\nThe predicted line widths depend on the cloud location, for a\nfixed nuclear source properties. Cloud located closer in reach\nequilibrium much faster and the velocity gradient is smaller.\nClouds located much further away will also show smaller velocity gradients since they are too extended to react to the\nvariable radiation flux. Therefore, the measurement of the line\nwidth will provide an independent limit to the cloud distance,\nand an additional test of the constant pressure cloud models.\nWe illustrate this issue in Table 2. We take the measured\nkinematical width of absorption lines measured in the X-ray\nspectrum of NGC 7469 by Scott et al. (2005) and we compare\nthem with our estimates based on the location of the ions.\nMeasured width in the X-ray band are always larger and\ngiven with significant errors. It is probable that many lines are\nactually blends and the resolution in X-ray spectra is not yet\nsatisfactory to test the model. Our model predicts many more\nstrong absorption lines in this energy band. Lines are measured\nmuch more precisely in the UV part of the spectrum so in the\nfuture out study will be extended into UV spectral region. The\navailable measurements for NGC 7469 UV data cannot be used\nimmediately for our purpose since line intensities and shifts\nwere measured for the lines widths fixed at the same value for\nall narrow absorption components (61 km/s and 45 km/s for\ntwo kinematical components; Scott et al. 2005).\n\nTable 2. Kinematical widths of the X-ray lines estimated from\nour cloud model in comparison with the line widths measured\nby Scott et al. (2005). Third column give the dominant location\nof the ion (lines identified by Scott et al. 2005 all come either\nfrom the intermediate or from the outer zone).\n\n4.2. Further improvements in modeling\nOur approach to modeling the time-dependent response of the\ncloud to irradiation was a first step in this direction. It is well\nknown that the problem is complicated, and the best studied\nclassical example is the time-dependent evolution of the expanding H + region around a newly born star (see Osterbrock\n1974). Unfortunately, our situation is more complex since we\ndo not deal with a single ionization front, and simple analytical\nestimates do not apply so easily to our case. However, further\nimprovement of the description of the cloud dynamics is necessary.\nParticularly important and difficult problem appears if\nclouds are at large distances from the center. Blustin et al.\n(2005) argued that the warm absorber is located in most sources\nat distance \u223c 1 pc. Our cloud at such a distance is far from radiative equilibrium. In this case time-dependent radiation transfer computations seem to be necessary.\nAcknowledgements. We thank to S. Collin, C. Done, T. Kallman, F.\nNicastro and I. Shlosman for helpful discussions.

Eq. 2 is derived analytically assuming a normal flux, neglecting the reflected flux (it is less than\n10% the incident flux), and using a classical formula for the\ncross-section (Osterbrock 1974). The recombination timescale\nfor each ion is estimated from the semi-analytical formulae of\nVerner & Ferland (1996)\ni\n(trec\n)\u22121 = ne (\u03b1r (T ) + \u03b1diel (T )),\n\n(8)\n\nwhere \u03b1r (T ) is the radiative recombination coefficient and\n\u03b1diel (T ) is the coefficient of the dielectronic recombination.\nInduced radiative recombination is negligible, hence this\ntimescale does not depend on the flux.\nAs ionization or recombination timescales are specific of\neach ion, we analyzed the ionization structure of a whole cloud.\nAn illustration of the method is shown in Table 3, where\nwe give the column densities, ionization and recombination\ntimescales, zone per zone, for Fexxv\u2013xxvii, Sxvi\u2013xvii, Sixiv\u2013\nxv, Oviii\u2013ix and Cvi\u2013vii, which are relevant for our model.\nRecombination timescales for fully ionized elements are quite\nlong (up to 2\u00d7108 s for hydrogen), but hydrogen and helium are\nalmost completely ionized, and since these ions do not undergo\nfrequent transitions, we determine the recombination timescale\nin each zone by identifying the dominant processes (i.e. both\nions in interaction with this process must have roughly the same\nabundances). Although in Table 3 the longest recombination\ntimescale is 6 \u00d7 105 s for the carbon in the hottest zone, but\nsuch transitions are of marginal importance. Therefore, the representative recombination timescale for a whole cloud is 2\u00d7104\ns (again for Fexxvi in the hot zone). Representative ions for\nthe recombination timescale in the intermediate, outer and end\nzones are Sixiv, Oix and Cvii, respectively.\nSince these ionization and recombination timescales depend respectively on the incident flux and the density (F =\n8 \u00d7 109 erg s\u22121 cm\u22122 and no = 107 cm\u22123 in our reference cloud),\nwe generalize the obtained values to Eqs. 2, 3.\n\n\f10\nproperty\nFexxv c\nFexxvi c\nFexxvii c\nFexxvi r\nFexxvii r\nSxvi c\nSxvii c\nSxvi i\nSixiv c\nSixv c\nSixv r\nOviii c\nOix c\nOviii i\nOix r\nCvi c\nCvii c\nCvi i\nCvii r\n\nChevallier et al.: Response of the warm absorber cloud to variable nuclear flux in AGN\nhot\n5 1017\n7 1017\n6 1017\n2 104\n104\n8 1016\n9 1017\n800\n8 1016\n2 1018\n5 104\n3 1016\n4 1019\n40\n2 105\n2 1015\n2 1019\n10\n6 105\n\nintermediate\n1018\n1017\n5 1015\n500\n400\n2 1018\n1018\n103\n3 1018\n4 1018\n2 103\n2 1018\n1020\n50\n7 103\n1017\n7 1019\n10\n104\n\nouter\n2 1010\n4 107\n3 104\n8\n7\n1015\n2 1013\n103\n2 1016\n5 1014\n30\n3 1018\n3 1018\n100\n100\n3 1017\n3 1018\n10\n200\n\nend\n2\n3 10\u22124\n2 10\u22128\n0.8\n0.7\n2 1010\n2 107\n103\n2 1012\n5 109\n3\n2 1017\n7 1015\n200\n10\n6 1017\n2 1017\n30\n20\n\nall\n2 1018\n9 1017\n7 1017\n2 104\n104\n2 1018\n2 1018\n103\n3 1018\n6 1018\n5 104\n7 1018\n2 1020\n200\n2 105\n1018\n1020\n30\n6 105\n\nTable 3.
