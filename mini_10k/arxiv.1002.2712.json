For the same reaction the loops on the other\nhand scale as v 3 /v 4 (mq /v 2 )[qv 2 ] = qmq /v, where the\nthe factor v 3 comes from the the non\u2013relativistic integral measure and the 1/v 4 from the two non\u2013relativistic\ntwo\u2013meson propagators. Further, the term in the round\nbrackets emerges, since pulling out a factor of mq , which\nis an energy scale, has to be balanced by a factor which\ncharacterizes the intrinsic energy, v 2 . In addition, the\n[qv 2 ] term contains the vertex factors from the external\npion coupling, q, and from the two p\u2013wave vertices in the\nloop. Thus, heavy meson loops are enhanced by a factor\n1/v \u223c 2. For the s\u2013wave decay \u03c8 \u2032 \u2192 hc \u03c0 0 on the other\nhand, the tree level scales as mq , while the loop here\nscales as v 3 /v 4 (mq /v 2 )[q/MD ]2 . All factors that appear\nare analogous to those discussed above up to the factor\n2\nq 2 /MD\n. The origin of this is, on the one hand, that the\npion is produced in a p-wave and, on the other hand, that\nthere is now only one p\u2013wave vertex in the loop (the \u03c8 \u2032\ndecay) giving rise to a momentum factor at that vertex.\nTo obtain a non\u2013vanishing result, however, that momentum has to be proportional to ~q (c.f.

In case of the reaction\nby a factor q 2 /(MD\n\u2032\n0\n\u03b7c \u2192 \u03c7c0 \u03c0 , we find from the same analysis a suppression of the loops by factor 1/10 - here the suppression\nis weaker due to a larger phase space. Thus we find on\nthe basis of the same power counting that heavy meson\nloops are enhanced compared to the tree level amplitudes\nin the isospin violating p\u2013wave decays like \u03c8 \u2032 \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c0 0 ,\nwhile they are strongly suppressed in s\u2013wave decays like\n\u03c8 \u2032 \u2192 hc \u03c0 0 . The latter observation allows us to predict\nthe partial decay width of \u03b7c\u2032 \u2192 \u03c7c0 \u03c0 0 . A confirmation of\nthis prediction would at the same time provide a strong\nsupport for the analysis of Ref. [13].\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nRecently, in a variety of calculations it was shown that\ncharmed meson loops contribute importantly to the decays of charmonia with and without isospin breaking (for\na overview, see [1]). For instance, using an effective Lagrangian approach (ELA), the intermediate meson loop\ncontributions are found to be essential for understanding the puzzling \u03c8(3770) non-DD\u0304 decays [2, 3]. They\nare also important in the J/\u03c8 decays into a vector and\na pseudoscalar mesons [4] and in the M 1 radiative transitions between two charmonia [5]. For isospin breaking\ndecays, besides \u03c0 0 \u2212 \u03b7 mixing and electromagnetic (e.m.)\neffects, one also expects the mass difference between the\nneutral and charged charmed mesons in the intermediate\nstates (i.e. in the meson loops) to play a role. This effect,\nknown to be of particular importance near the continuum\nthresholds, was studied in the decays \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c9\u03c0 0 [6, 7],\n\u2217\nJ/\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c6\u03b7\u03c0 0 [8, 9], and Ds0\n(2317) \u2192 Ds \u03c0 0 [10\u201312].\nIn Ref. [13] a non\u2013relativistic effective field theory\n(NREFT) was described, that allows one to study the role\nof charmed meson loops in charmonium decays in a systematic way. Applied to the reaction \u03c8 \u2032 \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c0 0 (\u03b7), the\nformalism revealed that the contribution from charmed\nmeson loops is enhanced by a factor of 1/v, with v \u2243 0.5\nbeing the charmed meson velocity[41], compared to the\ntree-level one. In this letter we apply NREFT to the decays \u03c8 \u2032 \u2192 hc \u03c0 0 and \u03b7c\u2032 \u2192 \u03c7c0 \u03c0 0 . We will show that in\nthese two decays, the loop contributions are highly suppressed, and hence the tree-level terms dominate the decay amplitudes. Testing experimentally the predictions\nthat emerge here, especially for the partial decay width\nfor \u03b7c\u2032 \u2192 \u03c7c0 \u03c0 0 , would provide a non\u2013trivial test of the\nNREFT and is thus of high importance towards an understanding of the properties of charmonia.\nIn this context it is instructive to compare the \u03c8 \u2032 \u2192\nJ/\u03c8\u03c0 0 decays to \u03c8 \u2032 \u2192 hc \u03c0 0 on the basis of power counting. Here we follow the reasoning of Ref. [13]. For the\nformer decay, which happens in a p\u2013wave, the tree level\n1\n\n\fthe reaction \u03b7c\u2032 \u2192 \u03c7c0 \u03c0 0 . In Section II, we will give\nthe tree level decay amplitudes by constructing the effective chiral Lagrangian. In Section III we present the\nNREFT [13] analysis for the heavy meson loops. As\nwe will demonstrate the explicit calculation supports the\nscale arguments presented above, that heavy meson loops\nare highly suppressed for the reactions under consideration. We also checked that the results are consistent\nwith a calculation using the ELA [2, 6, 7] - details will\nbe presented elsewhere [28]. In Section IV, the results\nfor the decay widths are given. In particular, the width\nof the \u03b7c\u2032 \u2192 \u03c7c0 \u03c0 0 is predicted. Some discussions and a\nsummary are given in the last section.\n\nThe hc (1 P1 ) has been the last charmonium state below the DD\u0304 threshold that was confirmed experimentally; for a comprehensive review of the charmonium\nphysics, see Ref. [14]. It was first established in pp\u0304 annihilation by the E760 Collaboration at Fermi Lab in\n1992 [15]. With J P C = 1+\u2212 , this state cannot be produced in e+ e\u2212 annihilation directly. Furthermore, due\nto the phase space restriction, it cannot be accessed by\n\u03c8 \u2032 decays into hc \u03b7. Instead, the only open strong decay to hc is via the isospin-violating \u03c8 \u2032 \u2192 hc \u03c0 0 process. As a consequence, this branching ratio is strongly\nsuppressed. Recently, the CLEO-c Collaboration with\n24.5 \u00d7 106 \u03c8 \u2032 events succeeded in measuring precisely the\nproduct of two branching ratios B(\u03c8 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0 0 hc ) \u00d7 B(hc \u2192\n\u03b3\u03b7c ) = (4.19 \u00b1 0.32 \u00b1 0.45) \u00d7 10\u22124 in [16]. This combined\nbranching ratio was confirmed by the BES-III Collaboration [17] with 110 million \u03c8 \u2032 events in the same channel,\nB(\u03c8 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0 0 hc )\u00d7B(hc \u2192 \u03b3\u03b7c ) = (4.58\u00b10.40\u00b10.50)\u00d710\u22124.\nFurthermore, they reported the first measurement of the\nabsolute value of the branching ratio for the \u03c8 \u2032 \u2192 hc \u03c0 0\nas B(\u03c8 \u2032 \u2192 \u03c0 0 hc ) = (8.4 \u00b1 1.3 \u00b1 1.0) \u00d7 10\u22124 [18]. Using\nthe PDG value for the total width of the \u03c8 \u2032 , \u0393(\u03c8 \u2032 ) =\n309 \u00b1 9 keV [19], the partial width of the \u03c8 \u2032 \u2192 hc \u03c0 0 is\n\u0393(\u03c8 \u2032 \u2192 hc \u03c0 0 ) = 0.26 \u00b1 0.05 keV.\n\nII.\n\nTREE LEVEL CONTRIBUTION\n\nSince the mass difference between the initial and final\ncharmonia is small, the emitted pion is soft. Hence one\ncan construct an effective chiral Lagrangian considering\nthe charmonia as matter fields. Since the charmonia are\nisoscalar and the pion has isospin one, the transitions violate isospin symmetry. Isospin breaking has two sources.\nOne is the mass difference between the up and down\nquarks, and the other one is of e.m. origin. For the transitions considered here, the e.m. effect can be neglected\n(for details, see [28]). Defining \u03c7 = 2B0 * diag (mu , md ),\nthe quark mass difference is contained in the operator \u03c7\u2212\nwhich contains an odd number of pion fields,\n\n(1)\n\nThis experimental progress makes it possible to study\nphysics of the hc to some extent of precision. In particular, its production in the decay \u03c8 \u2032 \u2192 hc \u03c0 0 appears to\nbe an ideal channel for investigating the isospin-violating\nmechanisms and the pertinent non-perturbative QCD dynamics. The reaction \u03c8 \u2032 \u2192 hc \u03c0 0 was first studied theoretically more than thirty years ago using \u03c0 0 \u2212 \u03b7 mixing [20]. In order to get an estimate of the width, the\nauthors estimated the coupling of the \u03c8 \u2032 to the hc and \u03b7\nby assuming it to be equal to the \u03c8 \u2032 J/\u03c8\u03b7 coupling, which\nwas extracted from the measured \u03c8 \u2032 \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03b7 width. As\na result, they obtained 5 . . . 30 keV for the partial decay\nwidth of the \u03c8 \u2032 \u2192 hc \u03c0 0 , which overshoots the measurement significantly.\nThe QCD multipole expansion (QCDME) was applied\nto this problem [21\u201324], and the following typical expression was obtained\n\u03b1M\nkeV\n(2)\n\u0393[\u03c8 \u2032 \u2192 hc \u03c0 0 ] = 0.12\n\u03b1E\n\n\u03c7\u2212 = u\u2020 \u03c7u\u2020 \u2212 u\u03c7\u2020 u,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere B0 = |h0|q\u0304q|0i|/F\u03c02 , F\u03c0 is the pion decay constant in the chiral limit, and u parameterizes the pion\nfields as the Goldstone bosons of the spontaneously broken SU(2)L \u00d7SU(2)R ,\n!\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03c00\n+\n\u221a\n\u03c0\ni\u03c6\n2\nu = exp \u221a\n, \u03c6=\n.\n(4)\n\u03c00\n\u03c0\u2212 \u2212 \u221a\n2F\u03c0\n2\nUsing the two-component notation of Ref.

A similar though more moderate suppression happens in case of the \u03b7c\u2032 \u2192 \u03c7c0 \u03c0 0 also. For this\ndecay, the momentum of the pion is q = q2 = 171 MeV,\nand the suppression factor is\n\nwith N = \u03bc12 \u03bc23 /(16\u03c0m1 m2 m3 ), where terms of order\nq 2 /c\u2032 and higher have been neglected. The approxima~\ntion is reasonable because for either of the two decays\nconsidered here, the pion momentum is small and fulfills\nq 2 \u226a c\u2032 .\n~\nWe can now have another, more refined look, at the \u221a\norc\nder of\nmagnitude\nestimate\nfor\nthe\nloop\nfunction.\nSince\n\u221a\nand c\u2032 are approximately the momenta of the charmed\nmesons in the loop, we count them as MD v with v being the velocity of the charmed mesons.

We checked that the ELA gives\nsimilar results, which confirms our analysis.\nOne may ask if the values of the coupling constants\nare so large that the suppression gets invalidated. In\nfact, because all the charmonia considered here are below the DD\u0304 threshold, the couplings cannot be extracted\ndirectly from the decay widths. However, one may get\na feeling about their values from other sources or from\nmodel calculations. Assuming the coupling of the \u03c8 \u2032 to\nthe charmed mesons has similar strength as the one of the\n4\n\n\fJ/\u03c8, we obtain g2\u2032 \u2243 2 GeV\u22123/2 from the \u03c8 \u2032 \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c0 0 (\u03b7)\nwhere the charmed meson loops dominate [13]. Values of\nthe same order of magnitude were obtained from various\nmodel calculations, see e.g. Refs. [36\u201338]. In Ref. [36],\nthe authors estimated g1 using vector meson dominance,\nwhich gives g1 = \u22124.2 GeV\u22121/2 . Using these values,\nthe resulting width \u0393(\u03c8 \u2032 \u2192 hc \u03c0 0 )loop \u2243 1 \u00d7 10\u22125 keV.\nIt is smaller by 4 orders of magnitude compared to the\nBES-III measurement, and it confirms our power counting estimate presented before.\nIn addition, even without any assumption on the coupling constants, from our analysis we can predict\n\u0393(\u03b7c\u2032 \u2192 \u03c7c0 \u03c0 0 )loop\n= 48 .\n\u0393(\u03c8 \u2032 \u2192 hc \u03c0 0 )loop\n\nthe total width of the \u03b7c\u2032 , \u0393(\u03b7c\u2032 ) = 14 \u00b1 7 MeV [19], the\nbranching fraction of the isospin-breaking transition is\n\u0001\nB \u03b7c\u2032 \u2192 \u03c7c0 \u03c0 0 = (1.1 \u00b1 0.6) \u00d7 10\u22124 .\n(25)\n\nNote, as a contrast, if the reactions were dominated\nby heavy meson loops, the predicted branching fraction\nwould be larger by a factor of about 5. The prediction, and therefore the dynamics underlying the decays,\nis testable with PANDA at FAIR [39].\nFurthermore, one may check if the tree-level contribution gives the right\n\u0001 order of magnitude of the decay\nwidth \u0393 \u03c8 \u2032 \u2192 hc \u03c0 0 through dimensional analysis. The\ntree\u2013level amplitudesp\nof Eq. (10) are proportional to the\ndimensionless factor Mf Mi C. Because the spin symmetry is violated as can be seen from the presence of the\nPauli matrices in Eq. (7), one may write\n\n(21)\n\nAs we will see, this ratio as derived solely from the loop\ncontributions, is much larger than the corresponding one\nderived from including the tree level amplitudes only.\nNote, however, that because v \u2243 0.5, there might be\nsizeable corrections to this result. Thus, for the mentioned decays it can be tested experimentally, if there is\na dominance from the loops or from the tree level contribution.\nIV.\n\np\n\u039bQCD\nMf Mi C = C\u0303\n,\nmc\n\nwith the dimensionless parameter C\u0303 being a number of\nnatural size, i.e. of order one.

The reason for the suppression is that, due to the small phase\nspaces of the two transitions, the pion momentum is\nmuch smaller than the approximate kinetic energy of\nthe intermediate charmed mesons. The situation is completely different for the transitions between two S-wave\n\nwhere \u039b\u03c7 \u2243 1 GeV, as well as heavy meson\n\u0001 loops. Using\nthe experimental value of \u0393 \u03c8 \u2032 \u2192 hc \u03c0 0 , we predict the\nwidth of the \u03b7c\u2032 \u2192 \u03c7c0 \u03c0 0 as\n\u0001\n(24)\n\u0393 \u03b7c\u2032 \u2192 \u03c7c0 \u03c0 0 = 1.5 \u00b1 0.3 \u00b1 0.2 keV,\n\nwhere the first uncertainty is experimental and the second theoretical due to neglecting higher orders. With\n\n5\n\n\fcharmonia. For the \u03c8 \u2032 \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c0 0 (\u03b7), the charmed meson loops are enhanced by a factor of 1/v compared with\nthe tree level contribution [13]. There is no factor proportional to ~q 2 , and hence the relative size of the pion\nmomentum to the kinetic energy of the virtual charmed\nmesons does not have an impact. The difference in these\ntwo cases is a consequence of the difference in the quantum numbers of the J/\u03c8 and hc which determine their\ncoupling to the charmed mesons.\nWe note in passing that it follows from our findings that approximating the \u03c8 \u2032 hc \u03b7 coupling by that for\n\u03c8 \u2032 J/\u03c8\u03b7, as done in Ref. [20], is not justified. In the light\nof this one then understands why the estimate made there\nis much larger than the measurement.\nIn summary, we have shown that intermediate charmed\nmeson loops are highly suppressed in the decays \u03c8 \u2032 \u2192\nhc \u03c0 0 and \u03b7c\u2032 \u2192 \u03c7c0 \u03c0 0 , which is completely different from\nthe situation of the \u03c8 \u2032 \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c0 0 (\u03b7). We confirmed the\ngeneral power counting arguments given by explicit calculations both within the NREFT as well as an effective Lagrangian approach. By constructing the LO chiral Lagrangian for the decays, and employing the experimental result for \u0393(\u03c8 \u2032 \u2192 hc \u03c0 0 ), we give a modelindependent prediction for the width of the \u03b7c\u2032 \u2192 \u03c7c0 \u03c0 0 ,\nwhich can be measured at PANDA, \u0393(\u03b7c\u2032 \u2192 \u03c7c0 \u03c0 0 ) =\n1.5 \u00b1 0.4 keV, where the experimental and theoretical\nuncertainties have been summed in quadrature. Note,\nwere the transitions dominated by the heavy meson loop\n\ncontributions, the predicted partial decay width would be\nlarger by a factor of about 8. An experimental confirmation of our prediction would provide a strong support for\nthe NREFT employed. Having available an effective field\ntheory that allows one to study both direct transitions\nas well as those mediated via heavy loops is an important step towards a detailed theoretical understanding of\ncharmonium states.\n\n[1] Q.
