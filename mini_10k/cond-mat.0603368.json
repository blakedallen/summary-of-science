Perspectives of\nthis field are discussed as well.\n\n1. Introduction\nSupramolecular chemistry provides a potentially attractive\nway of assembling and maintaining controlled\nnanostructures. The magnitude of the magnetic\ninteractions between the molecular building-blocks is\ncrucial to determine the properties of such materials. The\nmost intriguing situation is represented by molecular\nmagnetic clusters in which a total spin can be defined for\neach individual cluster as a result of dominant intracluster\ninteractions. The main parameter in this discussion is the\nenergy level separation between different spin states that\ngets enlarged by the reduced size of the molecular units.\nClearly at variance with bulk materials, for which energy\nlevels constitute a continuum band, these systems can be\nconsidered in between the classical and quantum world.1\nThe specific heat C of a given material, that is the heat\ncapacity per unit mass (or mole), is defined as the\nderivative of its internal energy, C = dU / dT. Its\ndetermination thus provides direct information on the\nenergy levels of the magnetic system. Because in a typical\nmolecular cluster there are energy levels split in the range\n1\u2212102 cm-1 (1 cm-1 = 1.43 K), anomalies in the specific\nheat are easily visible at liquid He temperature. One\nimportant feature that characterizes the specific heat\ntechnique with respect, e.g., magnetization or NMR, is\nthat it can be employed in zero applied-field; no magnetic\nperturbation is therefore introduced in the system. On the\nother hand, an external magnetic field in the range 10-1\u221210\nT gives rise to a Zeeman splitting of one or a few Kelvin\nto a molecular spin, so the anomaly in the specific heat\ncan be consequently shifted in a controlled manner. In\naddition, the dependence of C on magnetic fields gives\ninformation on the magnetic states, i.e., whether they are\n\"classical\" spin states or quantum superpositions\n(magnetic Schr\u00f6dinger's cat states) of these. Specific heat\nexperiments are currently carried out to detect fine energy\nsplittings in molecular magnets in a versatile way and\nwith an accuracy that is comparable to that of\nspectroscopic techniques.2\u22127\nThe approach to thermal equilibrium requires that\nenergy is exchanged between the spins and the lattice,\nwhich constitutes the thermal reservoir. The so-called\nsingle-molecule magnets (hereafter SMM's)1,8 relax to\nequilibrium by flipping the macroscopic spins over the\nclassical anisotropy barrier if the thermal energy is\n\nsufficiently large. Below certain blocking temperature, the\nrelaxation slows down drastically and quantum tunnelling\nthrough the anisotropy barrier is seen to contribute to the\ndynamics of the macroscopic spins. As we shall see\nbelow, specific heat experiments provide a privileged tool\nto investigate time-dependent phenomena in the quantum\nregime of such systems. 9\u221216\nSpin-spin correlations, that is ordering phenomena, are\nideally investigated using specific heat experiments.17\nGiven the fact that the interaction energies for molecular\nspins are usually weak, phase transitions may only occur\nat very low temperatures, typically below 1 K. In these\ncases, the application of any external -even smallmagnetic field may wash out the collective phenomena\nand the use of a non invasive technique, such as the\nspecific heat, is particularly suitable, if not necessary.18,19\nThe specific heat is also directly related to the magnetic\nentropy S of the system through S = \u222b(C/T)dT. This\nquantity is currently receiving an increasing attention20\u221223\nfor the search of possible applications of molecular\nmagnets as refrigerant materials.\nIn what follows we address these issues by presenting\nselected examples, whose list is far from exhaustive,\nbeing not this the scope of the article. Rather, examples\nwere chosen (i) to show some of the potentialities that this\ntype of research has achieved, (ii) to draw the attention to\nopen, but addressable, questions. The article is organized\nas follows. To provide a common language and references\nto the Reader, Sections 2 and 3 review the experimental\ntechniques for specific heat measurements and the basic\nmodels, respectively. In Section 4, we discuss molecular\nantiferromagnetic rings, which yield to clear-cut\nmanifestations of the Schottky anomaly easily tuned by\nexternal magnetic fields. Section 5 deals with the ability\nof the time-dependent specific heat technique to address\nthe fundamental role played by phonons as well as nuclei\nin the spin-lattice relaxation deep in the quantum regime.\nLong-range magnetic correlations in high-spin molecular\nclusters are analyzed in Section 6 by means of specific\nheat experiments, with particular emphasis on dipolar\nmagnets. Intimately related to the thermodynamics, the\nmagnetocaloric effect of molecule-based materials is\nreviewed in Section 7, whereas the concluding Section 8\nis devoted to probable future perspectives of this field.\n\n\f2. Experimental determination of the specific\nheat\nThe\nessential\ncalorimeter\nfor\nlow-temperature\nmeasurements of specific heat is made of a sample holder,\ntypically one sapphire or Si slice, with attached a small\nthermometer and a heater that can be a simple metal\nevaporation or a small resistor (see Fig. 1). Four or more\nwires hold the calorimeter and they often constitute the\nelectrical and the thermal link at the same time. For this\nreason, the size and the material of which these wires are\nmade of need to be carefully chosen according to the\ntemperature range and the size of the sample. In some\ncases, electrical connections to the calorimeter are ensured\nby superconducting wires, which inhibit heat transfer at\nthe very low temperatures. Heat link from the thermal\nbath to the calorimeter is thus provided by an additional\nmetallic wire. By changing this thermal link, the\ncharacteristic time of the experiment, that is the time\nneeded to collect one single measurement, can be varied\naccordingly. Typical characteristic times vary between 1\nand 102 s, and are also dependent on temperature. The use\nof time-dependent specific heat experiments will be\nexemplified in Section 5.\nThe sample with heat capacity Cs is thermally linked to\nthe thermometer and heater through the sample holder.\nThe empty calorimeter has a small but finite heat capacity\nreferred as Cadd = Cholder+Cthermo+Cheater, where add stands\nfor addenda. In first approximation, we may suppose that\nthese three objects are in excellent thermal contact and\nlinked to the thermal bath through a controlled thermal\nimpedance having thermal conductivity K1. A controlled\nheat quantity Q(t) is provided by the heater to the sample\nand the holder block so the response of the system is\ngiven in terms of temperature changes T(t). The relevant\nquantity is the total heat capacity Ctot = Cs+Cadd. The heat\nQ(t) also flows to the thermal bath through the thermal\nconductivity of the wires so the energy balance for this\nsystem is:\n\n\u2202 Q (t )\n\u2202T\n= K1 (T1 \u2212 T0 ) + Ctot 1\n\u2202t\n\u2202t\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere the term on the left is the rate of heat dissipated by\nthe heater, the first term on the right is the heat flowing\nfrom the system to the thermal bath and the second term\non the right is the heat used for the temperature variation\nof the system (sample + addenda). T0 is the fixed\ntemperature of the thermal bath while T1(t) is the actual\ntemperature of the system (sample + addenda) that is time\ndependent. Different solutions of Eq. (2.1) are possible\nwith a convenient choice of the thermal conductivity K1\nand of the time dependence of the heat Q(t).\nIf dQ(t)/dt = Q0\u03b4(t\u2212t0) (heat pulse at t = t0 for a very\nshort time) and K1 is very small (adiabatic condition), the\nsolution is T1\u2212T0 = Q0/Ctot. Thus, controlling the value of\nQ0 and measuring the temperature variation T1\u2212T0, one\nmay directly estimate the heat capacity Ctot = Q0/(T1\u2212T0).\nThis describes the adiabatic methods and it coincides with\nthe definition of specific heat.\nIf dQ(t)/dt = P\u03b8(t\u2212t0) (step like heat signal starting at t\n= t0) and K1 is finite, then the solution of Eq. (2.1) is\n\nT1\u2212T0 = PK1-1exp(\u2212(t\u2212t0)/\u03c4 1, where \u03c4 1 = Ctot/K1 is the\nrelaxation time. This method, known as relaxation\nmethod, was proposed by Bachmann et al.24 and it is now\nwidely used for automatized measurements.\nIf dQ(t)/dt = p0cos2(\u03c9t) (sinusoidal current through the\nheater) and K1 is finite, then the steady state solution is\nT1\u2212T0 = p0(4\u03c9C) -1\u03b1sin(2\u03c9t)+p0(2K1)-1, where \u03b1 is a\ncorrecting factors that in optimal condition is close to 1.\nThis method was initially proposed by Sullivan and\nSeidel25 and is known as the ac method.\nWhenever the rate of internal equilibrium \u03c4 2 = C/K2\nbecomes comparable with \u03c4 1 or \u03c9, the sample is not at\nthermal equilibrium with the thermometer during the heat\nchange. Typical samples of molecular magnets have bad\nthermal conductivity K2 and large specific heat. One thus\nhas to consider a temperature gradient between the sample\nand the holder or within the specimen itself. In these\nconditions the analysis gets more complicated but\napproximated solutions of the energy balance are still\npossible under certain limits. We refer to the original\nwork of Sullivan and Seidel25 for a more sophisticate\nanalysis of the ac method and we just remind that the\ncorrection\nfactor\n\u03b1\ncan\nbe\nexpressed\nas\n(1\u2212(8\u03c92\u03c4 12)\u22121+2\u03c92\u03c4 22+\u039a1/\u039a2). In the case of the relaxation\nmethod, deep analysis and solutions were presented by J.P\nShepherd26 and by J.S. Hwang, K.J. Lin and C. Tien.27 It\nturns out that, in the limit \u03c4 1 > \u03c4 2 , the temperature rise (or\ndecay) following a heat pulse is essentially given by the\nsum of two exponentials and the total specific heat can be\nanalytically derived from the fit of the temperature\nrelaxation with good precision, typically 1 or few per cent\nin the limit of \u03c41 > \u03c4 2. This is the reason why this method\nis currently used in automatic data acquisition systems.\nThe control of the \u03b1 coefficient for the ac method is less\neasy since it is very sensitive, for instance, to temperature\nchanges. This method is indeed known to have accuracy\nnot better than 10% or even worse under normal operative\nconditions. On the other hand the use of lock-in amplifiers\nallows precise detection of very small ac signal, thus the\nac method is preferred when the knowledge of the\nabsolute value is not essential and very small heat signals\nare requested (for instance to detect phase transition\nanomalies).\n\n3. Basic models for the contributions to the\nspecific heat\nThe specific heat of molecular magnets contains different\ncontributions which can be understood within the\nframework of conventional solid state models as discussed\nin several textbooks at which the reader is referred for a\ndeeper discussion.28\nIn a perfect crystal, there are 3N independent modes of\nlattice vibration, with N the number of ions in a unit cell.\nConsequently, since molecule-based materials usually\ncontain hundreds of ions per cell, their specific heats tend\nto saturate to a huge Dulong and Petit value 3NR at high\ntemperatures. Even at cryogenic temperatures the lattice\ncontribution is still substantial and, since it grows very\nfast with temperature, at \u2248 10 K the lattice contribution\nClatt becomes already predominant, masking most of the\n\n\ffeatures of the magnetic contribution Cm thereby limiting\nthe accuracy to which it can be determined. Furthermore,\nthe details of the spectrum of the quantized lattice\nvibrations (phonons) can be quite complex due to the huge\nnumber of independent vibration modes and no detailed\nstudy of this type has been attempted so far for this class\nof materials. One usually applies the approximation of an\nidealized simplified crystal with three acoustic branches\nand (3N\u22123) optical branches. The three acoustic branches\nare treated within the Debye model, giving the so-called\nDebye contribution CD , while the optical modes are\ndescribed by the Einstein model giving the corresponding\nCE contribution, so that Clatt = CD + CE. Within the\nmolecular clusters the atoms are strongly bonded, e.g. by\nionic bonds, whereas intermolecular clusters are much\nweaker (often the clusters form molecular crystals through\nvan der Waals bonding). Correspondingly, high- and lowenergy branches are both present in the phonon spectra.29\nOptical modes correspond nearly to the vibration spectra\nof the isolated molecule, giving rise to Einstein modes\nthat can be broadened in energy by intermolecular\ninteractions. The Einstein and Debye contributions are\nrespectively expressed as:\n\u239bT \u239e\nexp\u239c E \u239f\n\u239b TE \u239e 2\nCE\n\u239dT\u23a0\n= 3\u239c \u239f\n\u239d T \u23a0 \u23a1 \u239b TE \u239e \u23a42\nR\n\u23a2exp\u239c \u239f \u22121\u23a5\n\u23a3 \u239dT\u23a0 \u23a6\n\n(3.1)\n\nwhere \u03b5\u0395 = kBTE is the energy of the optical phonon mode\nand\n\n\u239b T \u239e\nCD\n= 9\u239c\n\u239f\nR\n\u239d \u0398D \u23a0\n\n3 \u0398 /T\nD\n\n\u222b\n\nxe x\ndx\n(e \u22121) 2\nx\n\n0\n\n(3.2)\n\nwhere h\u03c9D = hckD = 2\u03c0kB\u0398D is the Debye energy for\nwhich the characteristic linear dispersion \u03c9D = ckD of the\nacoustic branch is assumed, with c the velocity of sound.\nFor T << \u0398D (typically T \u2264 \u0398D/50) the latter equation can\nbe approximated as:\n3\n\n\u239b T \u239e\nCD\n\u239f\u239f .\n= 234\u239c\u239c\nR\n\u239d \u0398D \u23a0\n3\n\n(3.3)\n\nIn practice the T behaviour is hardly visible in molecular\ncompounds unless one may neglect (or independently\nknows) the magnetic contribution at very low temperature.\nIn the temperature range 0.1\u221220 K the typical behaviour\nof the lattice contribution is Clatt \u221d T \u03b1 with \u03b1 ~2.6\u22123 and\nthe typical \u0398D values that one obtains range between 15\nand 50 K. These \u0398D values are much lower than usually\nfound for insulating solids or intermetallic compounds\n(\u0398D typically ranges within 150 to 600 K in these cases)\nand also peculiar are the TE values that can be as low as\n20\u221230 K. Both these features can simply arise from the\nweak intermolecular bonds. TE values can also arise from\nvery localised optical modes and they are also found in\ndisordered organic solid solvents. At any rate, the \u0398D\nvalues obtained cannot be expected to correspond to a\nsimple unique sound propagation velocity associated with\n\na single \u03c9(k) dispersion relation, so one should use such\nlow \u0398D values with care. Alternative phenomenological\nexpressions to fit Clatt are presented in Ref. [30] where the\nspecific heat of a crystal composed of non-magnetic\nmolecular rings was also studied.\nThe magnetic contribution Cm to the specific heat is\nreadily understood if one calculates the energy Em of a\ntwo- or multi-level magnetic system and assuming a\ncanonical Boltzmann distribution describing the\npopulation of levels. So, since Cm = dEm/dT, for a twolevel system we have the expression of the well known\nSchottky anomaly:\n\u239bT \u239e\nexp \u239c 0 \u239f\n2\nC S g 0 \u239b T0 \u239e\n\u239dT \u23a0\n=\n\u239c \u239f\n2\nR\ng1 \u239d T \u23a0 \u23a1\ng0\n\u239b T0 \u239e \u23a4\n+\n1\nexp\n\u239c \u239f\u23a5\n\u23a2\ng1\n\u239d T \u23a0\u23a6\n\u23a3\n\n(3.4)\n\nwhere g0 and g1 are the degeneracies of the ground and the\nfirst excited state, respectively, and kBT0 is the energy gap\nbetween these two states. If g0 = 1 and g1 = 1 the Schottky\nanomaly has a characteristic maximum at T ~ T0/2 so the\nenergy gap kBT0 can be immediately visualized by looking\nat the temperature at which the anomaly exhibits its\nmaximum. If the magnetic system has many levels Ei the\nSchottky expression can be generalized as:\n\nCS\n= \u03b22\nR\n\n\u2211E\ni\n\n2\n\n2\ni\n\n\u23a1\n\u23a4\nexp(\u2212\u03b2E i )\u2211 exp(\u2212\u03b2E i ) \u2212 \u23a2\u2211 E i exp(\u2212\u03b2E i )\u23a5\n\u23a3 i\n\u23a6\ni\n\u23a1\n\u23a42\n\u23a2\u2211 exp(\u2212\u03b2E i )\u23a5\n\u23a3 i\n\u23a6\n(3.5)\n\nThis expression is commonly used to describe the\nmagnetic contributions in molecular magnets. For instance\nif the distribution of the lowest lying energy levels is\nknown, CS can be easily calculated or alternatively one\nmay introduce one or few parameters describing the\nmagnetic system and fit the specific heat data to fix them.\n\n4. Specific heat of molecular antiferromagnetic\nwheels\nMolecular rings have recently attracted considerable\ninterest for several reasons: in many cases they have\nalmost planar shape with an axial symmetry of the spin\narrangement whilst the dominant antiferromagnetic\nHeisenberg exchange coupling between nearest neighbour\nspin centres and the even number of spins provide a\nsinglet ground state at low temperature and zero field to\nthe isometallic wheels. The lowest lying excitations\nfollow a Lande's rule for which the energy gap between\nsubsequent levels is proportional to S(S+1) where S is the\nspin of the excitation state whilst some other excitations\nforms further bands31 with features related to the special\nboundary conditions of these finite AF spin chains. The\nappeal of these AF rings comes firstly from the energy\nseparation between the lowest lying states that range\nbetween few Kelvin and few tens of Kelvin, so that the\nlevels are well isolated at liquid helium temperature.\n\n\fMoreover magnetic fields of few Tesla, easily accessible\nin the laboratory, may lower the energy of excited states\nleading to subsequent level crossing and spin flip of the\nground state for increasing magnetic fields. Among the\neven membered cyclic spin systems, one of the first\nexamples were the ferric wheels made of Fe3+ ions\ncarrying a s = 5/2 spin. Several isometallic molecular\nrings with different nuclearity exist, namely, Fe6, 32 Fe8,\nFe10,33 Fe12 34 and Fe18. 35 Of great interest is also a family\nof cyclic systems made by Cr3+ ions. The best example is\na molecular ring containing eight Cr3+ ions disposed in an\nalmost perfect octagon (yet, only C4 point group\nsymmetry at room temperature).36 This molecular\ncompound has chemical formula [Cr8F8(O2CCMe3)16] and\nit crystallizes in a tetragonal or monoclinic space group\nwith four halves of molecules per unit cell. Centimetresized single crystals can be grown and they are relatively\nstable in ambient conditions. Ab-initio calculations show\nthat Cr3+ ions carry a local spin moment s = 3/2 and that\nthe preferred arrangement of the eight spins is\nantiferromagnetic.37\nFor what concerns the specific heat, the case of Fe10\ncan be considered as paradigmatic2 (Fig. 2). The scale of\nenergies allows indeed in this case a clear identification of\ndifferent contributions: at tens of Kelvin, the lattice\ndominates, at 1\u22123 K magnetic Schottky anomaly arises\nwhile the mK region is dominated by hyperfine\ncontributions. It can be easily noticed in Fig. 2 that the\nSchottky anomaly, arising mainly from the energy gap\nbetween the ground state S = 0 and the first excited state\nwith S = 1, becomes well resolved at low temperature\nwhile the lattice contribution dominates already above 6\nK. The Schottky anomaly can be tentatively accounted for\nby considering simple two energy levels separated by an\neffective energy gap \u2206/kB = 4.47 \u039a: the exponential drop\nof C/R at low temperature is well described by such a\nsimple model, yielding an estimate of the energy\nseparation between the ground state and the barycentre of\nthe first excited triplet. At higher temperatures, further\nexcited states cannot be neglected and the magnetic\ncontribution must be separated from the lattice\ncontribution for a correct analysis. At 0.5 K a small bump,\nprobably due to low energy excitations in a small fraction\nof defected rings, is visible and below 0.3 K, C/R shows\nan upturn that scales as T \u22122. The latter is due to hyperfine\ninteractions. We may fit the specific heat data to\ndetermine the characteristic parameters of the spin\nHamiltonian. The position of the Schottky anomaly\nprovides a precise determination of the lowest energy gap\nwithout the need for applying a (perturbing) external\nmagnetic field and no need of using single crystals. This\nis, in general, enough to fix the main Heisenberg\nexchange coupling in the limit in which this is the leading\nterm of the spin Hamiltonian, but only a rough estimation\nof the zero field splitting parameter can be given since this\ndoes not give any distinctive feature (only a broad\ncontribution) to the C(T) curve.\nA way to overcome this problem is to apply external\nmagnetic fields and measure a few C(T) curves for\ndifferent H values. In this case the energy level scheme\nchanges as a consequence of the Zeeman term and the\nSchottky anomaly shifts consequently. In this way\n\ndifferent independent C(T,H) curves can be used to\ndetermine the microscopic parameters of the spin\nHamiltonian. The latter can be exactly diagonalized if the\nring has few (n) centres and/or their spin (s) is low. Yet,\nfor n > 10 and s \u2265 5/2 the Hilbert space is already huge\n[(s)n] and the exact diagonalization becomes unfeasible\neven with the modern computational facilities.\nNevertheless, the way in which the physical properties of\nfinite spin chain merge to those of an infinite chain is an\ninteresting issue and theoretical methods to treat such\nmesoscopic systems deserve much attention since they are\nof fundamental importance to describe nano-objects. A\nsemiclassical model was proposed to describe AF rings\nmade of generic n spin centres and this provides an\nanalytical solution for the lowest lying states38 that was\nused to fit the specific heat of Fe12 ferric wheel.3\nThis semiclassical model was also used to describe the\ntunnelling of the N\u00e9el vector, which phenomenon is\nanalogous to the tunnelling of the cluster spins observed\nin high-spin Mn12 and Fe8, except that the net total spin of\nthe (ferrimagnetic) molecule is replaced by the N\u00e9el\nvector of the antiferromagnetic molecule. This\nphenomenon was recently discussed and searched for in\nmolecular rings. The first problem in obtaining clear\nevidence for such a tunnelling is related to the fact that the\nN\u00e9el vector gives no magnetic signal to be detected with\nconventional magnetometers. The second issue is the\nidentification of a specific energy barrier through which\nthe N\u00e9el vector can tunnel. This is a subtle point since by\nsweeping the magnetic field the AF spin system switches\nthrough different spin wave modes that do not necessary\nimply a true tunnelling of the N\u00e9el vector through an\nenergy barrier. Such a barrier and the corresponding\ntunnelling events must be carefully determined from the\nspin Hamiltonian. Exact diagonalization methods are\npreferable for this task although the semiclassical model\nprovides\nthe\nessential\nphysics.\nSpecific\nheat\nmeasurements can be performed at fixed temperature (T \u2264\n1 K) and in a sweeping magnetic field in order to\ndetermine precisely the energy barrier involved in the\ntunnelling of the N\u00e9el vector. The debate is still open on\nthis interesting topic.\nSpecific heat measurements at fixed temperature and\nhigh magnetic field also allow us to address further\ninteresting issues. As previously mentioned, in the case of\nhomometallic rings the first excited state S = 1 is lead to\ncross the ground state, namely the S = 0 singlet, by an\nexternal magnetic field of a few Tesla. Increasing the field\neven further, the new ground state (with quantum number\nequal to S = 1) is progressively crossed by subsequent\nexcited (i.e. S = 2,3,...) states. For symmetric rings the\ntwo lowest lying excited states, with S = 1 and S = 2\nquantum numbers, have different parity, i.e. their wave\nfunctions have different irreducible representations. It\nturns out that terms of the spin Hamiltonian with the axial\nsymmetry of the ring are not able to mix the S and the S+1\nstates, so a true crossing is expected in this case with no\nrepulsion between states. An odd case was presented in\nRef. [4] in which the specific heat of Fe6 rings was\nmeasured at 0.78 K in sweeping field up to 28 T. These\nmeasurements did not necessarily require a high precision\nof the absolute value of C, but a high sensitivity to\n\n\fmeasure the changes of C as the external magnetic field is\nswept. For such reasons, the ac measuring method was\npreferred in this case. A first crossing between the |0> and\nthe |1,-1> was observed at the crossing field Bc1 = 11.7 T\nand a second crossing between the |1,-1> and the |2,-2> at\nBc2 = 22.4 T. Close to the crossing field the system is well\nrepresented by the two lowest levels only. The Schottky\nanomaly\ncan\nbe\nexpressed\nas\nC\n=\n(\u2206/kBT)2exp(\u2206/kBT)[1+exp(\u2206/kBT)]-2 and it exhibits\nmaxima when the energy gap \u2206 ~ 2.4 kBT while it is\nexpected to vanish for \u2206 = 0. In these experiments the\nspecific heat did not vanish at Bc's indicating a level\nrepulsion, contrary to what is expected for true crossing\nbetween two levels. The origin of this behaviour can be\ndue to the presence of anti-symmetric terms in the spin\nHamiltonian, like the Dzyaloshinski-Morya one, which do\nnot have the axial (i.e. S6 point group) symmetry of the\nFe6 ring. These terms can mix states with different parity\nand then induce the level anticrossing.5 Yet, other\nextrinsic factors, like inhomogeneity within the crystals,\nmay lead to broadening of the heat capacity peak and\neventually to non vanishing heat capacity at Bc's. These\nexperiments were repeated on molecular Cr8 rings39 and in\nthis case the Schottky anomaly was found to vanish at the\ncrossing fields within the experimental accuracy6 (Fig. 3).\nThese experiments showed, at least, the great potentiality\nof specific heat measurements to get a direct estimate of\nthe repulsion between two crossing levels on bulk\nsamples.\nA step further was done as soon as heterometallic\nmolecular rings were synthesized. In particular one of the\neight Cr ions was replaced by a divalent transition metal,\nlike Zn, Ni, etc. Thus an \"extra\" spin was introduced in\nthe otherwise compensated Cr8 ring and the ground state\nin zero field is no more a singlet. The axial symmetry of\nthe ring was broken and consequently two consecutive\nstates, with quantum number S and S+1, can easily be\nmixed by terms in the spin Hamiltonian such as the\nanisotropic one. In this case the mixing of two\nconsecutive states is enhanced at the crossing field and the\ntotal spin of the ring oscillates between two states with\nquantum number S and S+1. These quantum oscillations\ncan be tuned by changing the angle \u03b8 between the ring\naxis and the external magnetic field and the level\nrepulsion vanishes for angle \u03b8 close to zero and \u03c0/2 while\nan energy gap develops for intermediate orientations. This\nexpectation was confirmed by specific heat experiments\non heterometallic Cr7Zn rings which have a ground state S\n= 3/2 in zero field, as shown in Fig. 4.7\n\n5. Quantum tunnelling and quantum coherence\nin single-molecule magnets\nThe phenomenon of tunnelling is one of the most\nfascinating predictions of Quantum Mechanics, and one\nthat fully contradicts our daily perception of the way in\nwhich \"real\" objects behave. Quantum tunnelling is\ndirectly associated with the description of a physical\nsystem in terms of wave functions and distributions of\nprobability, which emanates from Heisenberg's\nuncertainty principle. By tunnelling across an energy\n\nbarrier, a physical system, like a particle, can escape from\na potential energy well towards a more stable state or even\noscillate between equivalent configurations of equal\nenergy. The first process explains, for example, the alpha\ndecay of heavy nuclei,40 which takes place when a nucleus\nof 4He irreversibly (or incoherently) escapes from the\ninterior of an unstable nucleus. The second situation\ndescribes the coherent oscillation of the hydrogen plane of\nthe ammonia molecule NH3.41 In the latter case, energy\neigenstates are no longer associated with definite atomic\nlocations (i.e. to the hydrogen plane being either below or\nabove the N) but to linear superpositions of these. In\naddition, the classical degeneracy is lifted by an energy\nsplitting \u2206, usually called the \"tunnel splitting\", between\nthe energies corresponding to either symmetric or\nantisymmetric superpositions. The existence of a tunnel\nsplitting \u2206, thus also of these weird quantum states, can be\nshown by specific heat measurements because it leads to a\nSchottky anomaly, Eq. (3.4), with a maximum for \u2206 = 2.4\nkBT. The ability of specific heat experiments to measure\nsmall energy splittings has been used to study microscopic\nsystems, like molecules and defects embedded in solids,\nwhich perform hindered rotational or translational\nmovements also by tunnelling.42\nThe single-molecule magnets are ideal materials to\ninvestigate these tunnelling phenomena at the mesoscopic\nscale, intermediate between the microscopic and\nmacroscopic worlds. These clusters contain a core, made\nof a few magnetic ions strongly coupled to each other by\nsuperexchange interactions, surrounded by a shell of\norganic ligands. Crystal-field effects usually lead to a\nstrong anisotropy for the net molecular spin S, which in\nthe simplest uniaxial case favours two opposite\norientations along a given molecular axis z. In a magnetic\nfield and at sufficiently low temperatures, SMM's can be\ndescribed by the following Hamiltonian43\nH = \u2212DSz2 + H' \u2013 g\u03bcB(HxSx + HySy + HzSz)\n\n(5.1)\n\nThe angular dependence of the magnetic potential energy\nhas therefore the shape of the well-known double-well\npotential (see Fig. 5). Tunnelling across the potential\nenergy barrier is allowed by terms that do not commute\nwith Sz, such as those contained in H, associated with\ndeviations from perfect uniaxial symmetry, or the offdiagonal Zeeman terms.\nFor objects as large as these molecules, though, the\nobservation of tunnelling faces two important difficulties.\nThe first arises from the fact that the tunnelling\nprobabilities and \u2206 depend exponentially on the height Ucl\n\u2248 DS2 of the energy barrier, which usually scales with the\nvolume. The ground state \u2206 (\u2248 10-6 K for Mn4, 10-8 K for\nFe8, 10-10 K for Mn12) is completely unmeasurable by\nmeans of specific heat experiments. But, in addition, even\nat zero-applied magnetic field, the weak dipolar\ninteraction with neighbouring molecular spins in the same\ncrystal induces a bias \u03be = 2g\u03bc BSHdip,z that is many orders\nof magnitude larger than \u2206. The splitting of the ground\nstate doublet then approximately equals \u03be and the lowest\nenergy eigenstates are the classical spin-up or spin-down\nstates.44,45 Under these conditions, incoherent tunnelling\ncan still provide the spins a mechanism for reversing their\n\n\forientations and, as shall be considered in detail below,\nfor the attainment of thermal equilibrium.\nAn important advantage of some SMM's is their\ntendency to form molecular crystals, in which the\nanisotropy axes of all molecular clusters are aligned. The\noff-diagonal energy terms in Eq. (5.1) can then be\nmodified by the application of external magnetic fields B\u22a5\nperpendicular to the anisotropy axis z.46 As Fig. 5 shows\nschematically, a magnetic field applied along the x\ndirection lowers Ucl but does not affect the inversion z \u2194\n\u2212z symmetry of the double well potential. Since offdiagonal terms play the role of a kinetic energy in this\ntunnelling problem, this enables reducing the effective\nmass. By increasing B\u22a5, it is then possible to significantly\nincrease \u2206 (see the upper panel of Fig. 6), which can\neventually become larger than the splittings \u03be caused by\nexternal perturbations. Under such conditions, the energy\nsplitting of the magnetic ground state becomes dominated\nby \u2206 and the eigenstates become quantum superpositions\nof spin-up and spin-down states.\nThe lower panel of Fig. 6 shows specific heat data\nmeasured on an oriented sample of Fe8 molecular clusters.\nNear 1.7 T, the data show a jump that indicates that only\nabove this field the spins are in thermal equilibrium with\nthe lattice.47 The equilibrium specific heat shows a\nmaximum centred on 2.5\u22123 T. The position of the peak\nagrees with the perpendicular fields for which \u2206 is\nexpected to become of order of the thermal energy, as\nexpected for the Schottky anomaly of a two-level system,\nEq. (3.4). These field-dependent specific heat experiments\nneatly show the existence of a finite tunnel splitting \u2206.\nThe results agree well with the specific heat calculated\nusing the quantum energy levels of Fe8. This is in sharp\ncontrast with the behaviour expected for classical\nmagnetic moments, whose spin-up and spin-down states\nremain degenerate in a transverse magnetic field.\nThese and similar results obtained for other SMM's,\nsuch as Mn4 and Mn12,11,12,14 show that the application of\ntransverse magnetic fields provides a very useful method\nto make quantum states robust against decoherence and\nhow specific heat experiments enable us to measure the\ntunnel splittings. However, much work is required yet to\ncontrol the coherent evolution with time of these\nsuperpositions, which could open the door for applications\nin the domain of quantum computation.\n\nwhere Cm0 is the contribution to the specific heat of \"fast\"\nre-equilibrating levels, Cmeq is the equilibrium specific\nheat, and \u0393 is the relaxation rate. For SMM's having a\ndouble-well potential energy landscape, Cm0 is usually\nassociated with transitions between levels located on each\nside of the energy barrier, whose relative populations\nequilibrate at very fast rates \u03930 \u223c 10-8 s. By contrast,\ntransferring population between levels located on different\npotential energy wells requires crossing the energy barrier\nUcl and therefore takes place at a much lower rate \u0393.\nMeasuring specific heat at varying experimental times\ncan therefore be used to obtain information on the\nprocess, either classical or by quantum tunnelling, by\nwhich the molecular spins attain thermal equilibrium with\nthe phonon lattice. It is important to mention also that,\nwhereas any tunnelling process gives rise to a\nmagnetization change, only those that imply a transfer of\nenergy between the spins and the lattice contribute to the\nspin-lattice relaxation rate \u0393. We next consider the\ndifferent mechanisms that dominate the spin-lattice\nrelaxation of SMM's as temperature decreases.\nPhonon-induced quantum tunnelling via thermally\nactivated states\nFigure 7 shows Cm of Fe8 clusters measured at zero field\nas a function of temperature. The zero-field splitting\ncaused by the anisotropy terms in Eq. (5.1) is of order 28\nK for this cluster.44,48 It gives rise to a multi-level\nSchottky anomaly, Eq. (3.5), with a maximum above 3 K.\nThis anomaly corresponds to the intrawell contribution\nCm0. When kBT << (2S-1)D \u2248 5.5 K, it decays\nexponentially indicating the depopulation of all levels\nabove the ground state doublet.\nFor lower temperatures, the specific heat is dominated\nby transitions between the two lowest lying magnetic\nstates \u00b1S, split by dipolar interactions. However, as the\nFigure 7 shows, Cm deviates from equilibrium below\napproximately 1.3 K. 11 By increasing the experimental\ntime, the cross-over between equilibrium and offequilibrium conditions shifts towards lower temperatures.\nThe same behaviour is observed for other clusters, such as\nMn12.11 It clearly indicates that \u0393 depends strongly on\ntemperature. Studies of the ac susceptibility and magnetic\nrelaxation, have indeed shown that \u0393 follows the\nArrhenius law: 49-51\n\nTowards the thermal equilibrium of the molecular spins\nwith the lattice\n\n\u0393 = \u03930 exp(\u2212U/kBT)\n\nThe specific heat directly reflects the population of the\ndifferent energy levels and how they are modified by\ntemperature. Under thermal equilibrium conditions,\npopulations are simply given by Boltzmann statistics.\nHowever, the presence of energy barriers separating\nmagnetic molecular states can lead to a slow relaxation\ntowards this equilibrium state, especially at low\ntemperatures. As a result, the populations and therefore\nthe specific heat depend on the timescale of the\nmeasurement.9 Usually, the time-dependent magnetic\nspecific heat can be approximated by an exponential\ndecay 10\n\nThis thermally activated process is a generalization of the\nOrbach process of paramagnetic atoms52 and it is\nreasonably well understood.53\u221256 Quantum tunnelling takes\nplace predominantly via the lowest lying states \u00b1m for\nwhich tunnelling is not blocked by dipolar interactions\n(\u2206m > \u03bem). Since an external magnetic field applied along z\nalso induces a bias, this process is resonant, i.e., it\nbecomes faster at the crossing fields Bn \u2248 nD/g\u03bcB, when\nstates located on opposite sides of the energy barrier\nbecome degenerate, allowing tunnelling to occur. This\nquantum effect leads to maxima in the non-equilibrium Cm\nvs. B\u23d0\u23d0 curves, as is shown in Fig. 8.\nIf, by contrast, the field is applied perpendicular to the\nanisotropy axis, it increases \u2206m of all levels. Tunnelling\n\nCm(t) = Cm0 + (Cmeq \u2013 Cm0) e\u2212\u0393t\n\n(5.2)\n\n(4.3)\n\n\ftakes place via progressively lower lying states, which\ngives rise to a gradual decrease of Ucl and of the blocking\ntemperature (see Fig. 7). Eventually (for B\u22a5 > 1.7 T in the\ncase of Fe8), relaxation takes place via direct processes,52\ni.e. by phonon-induced tunnelling between the two lowest\nlying states. The fact that this phenomenon occurs at rates\nof order 1 s-1 indicates that the wave-functions of these\ntwo states overlap significantly. Under these conditions, \u0393\ndepends weakly on T and the spins remain in equilibrium\ndown to very low temperatures, as we had seen in the\nprevious section (Fig. 6) and it is shown again in Fig. 7.\nSpin-lattice relaxation in the quantum regime\nThe mechanisms responsible for the spin-lattice relaxation\nat sufficiently high temperatures or applied magnetic\nfields are relatively well understood. They are, in fact,\ngeneralisations of the direct and Orbach mechanisms that\noperate in the case of paramagnetic atoms. Let us consider\nnext the situation in the limit of very low temperatures\n(typically T < 1 K) and B = 0, when only the two lowest\nlying levels are populated. Since \u03be >> \u2206 for these states,\ncoherent spin tunnelling is nearly forbidden and the direct\nphonon-induced processes have extremely small\nprobabilities (of order 10-9 s-1 for Mn4 clusters and 10-14 s1\nfor Fe 8). It is however by now firmly established that\ntunnelling is made possible by the interaction with rapidly\nfluctuating hyperfine fields, which bring a significant\nnumber of electron spins into resonance.57 Coupling to a\nnuclear spin bath allows ground state tunnelling over a\nrange of local bias fields \u03be much larger than the tunnel\nsplitting \u2206. Within this theory, magnetic relaxation could\nin principle occur with no exchange of energy with the\nphonons of the molecular crystal.58 The question of\nwhether this tunnelling process is able to bring the spins\nto thermal equilibrium is not yet fully understood.13,15,16,58\nAs we show next, specific heat experiments are ideally\nsuited to investigate this fundamental question from an\nexperimental point of view.\nFigure 9 shows the time-dependent specific heat of\nMn4Cl clusters.15 Again, the specific heat is dominated,\nabove 2 K, by the Schottky associated with the anisotropy\nand by phonon contributions. Below 1 K, Cm deviates\nfrom equilibrium. These small clusters have relatively low\nanisotropy barriers Ucl \u2248 14 K. This enables to measure a\nlarge fraction of the evolution of Cm with time in the\navailable experimental time window. By fitting Eq. (5.2)\nto this data, it is possible to extract \u0393. This is shown in the\nlower panel of Fig. 9 as a function of temperature, where\ndata obtained from magnetic relaxation experiments are\nalso included. A cross-over from a thermally activated\nregime, dominant at high temperatures, to a temperatureindependent one is evident from these data. This shows\nthat spins are indeed able to attain thermal equilibrium via\nincoherent tunnelling processes. Remarkably enough, the\nmeasured \u0393 is six orders (!) of magnitude larger than the\nrate predicted for conventional phonon-induced direct\nprocesses.10,54 Also surprising is the fact that the rate\nextracted from specific heat experiments agrees\nquantitatively with what is obtained from the decay of the\nmagnetization data.58 In other words, the same tunnelling\nmechanism, mediated by nuclear spins, that flips the spins\nbrings them also to thermal equilibrium. Contrary to the\npredictions of the model by Prokofe'v and Stamp,57 the\n\nrelaxation of the energy of the electronic spins takes place\ntowards the phonon bath and not just to the nuclear spin\nbath.\nThe interpretation that the spin-lattice relaxation is\nmediated, in the quantum regime, by the interaction with\nnuclear spins can be tested by comparing results obtained\nfor samples with different isotopic content. In Fig. 10, we\nshow data measured for two samples of Fe8 clusters.16 The\nfirst was prepared with Fe containing mainly the\nnonmagnetic 56Fe nuclei, whereas the second one was\nenriched in the magnetic 57Fe isotope,60 which carries a I\n= 1/2 nuclear spin. Above 1 K, the specific heat of both\ncompounds is nearly the same, showing that the magnetic\nanisotropy and intermolecular vibrations are very similar\nfor both. By contrast, the isotopic effect is evident at very\nlow temperatures: for approximately the same time scales,\nthe inclusion of nuclear spins leads to a much larger\nspecific heat for the 57Fe8.\nAs for Mn4, the relaxation rate of 57Fe8 was extracted\nby fitting the variation of Cm with experimental times.16\nThe lower panel of Fig. 10 shows the rates deduced from\ndifferent experimental techniques: ac-susceptibility, dcmagnetization,60 NMR,61 M\u00f6ssbauer,62 besides the\nspecific heat.11,16 Together, they result into a \u0393(\u03a4) curve\nwhose frequency window spans remarkably over twelve\norders of magnitude. It is seen that \u0393 follows the\nthermally activated behaviour down to approximately 1 K,\nwhereas below this temperature it becomes much less\ndependent on T. The rate extrapolated to zero-temperature\nis nearly ten (!) orders of magnitude faster than what\nwould be expected for conventional phonon-assisted\nprocesses. Unfortunately, Cm of the standard Fe8 sample\nwas too small to allow any determination of \u0393. Yet, the\nmeasured data are compatible with \u0393 being at least three\ntimes smaller than in the case of 57Fe8. These results\nconfirm the isotopic effects on quantum tunnelling that\nhas been studied by magnetic relaxation experiments60 and\nNMR.61 In addition, it confirms that nuclear spins play a\ncrucial role in the quantum mechanism of spin-lattice\nrelaxation of the molecular spins, something that had not\nbeen predicted by any theory. It is curious that nuclear\nspins are themselves not in equilibrium,62,63 as it is clear\nfrom the data of Figs. 9 and 10, since they exchange\nenergy with the phonon bath via the interaction with the\nelectronic spins. These results call for an extension of the\nnuclear-mediated tunnelling mechanism57 to incorporate\nthe possibility of emission and absorption of phonons.\n\n6. Long-range magnetic ordering\nCritical phenomena are often studied by means of specific\nheat experiments.17 A major reason is the appearance of a\n\u03bb-type anomaly in the specific heat at the critical\ntemperature, in which the material undergoes an orderdisorder phase transition. Magnetic susceptibility shows a\nsimilar behaviour but whereas for specific heat the \u03bb-type\nanomaly implies a discontinuity in the derivative of the\ninternal energy and therefore a phase transition (although\nit may be not magnetic), for the magnetic susceptibility it\nis not strictly so, and spikes may have other sources, i.e.\nblocking or freezing of the magnetic moments.\n\n\fLong-range magnetic order (LRMO) in molecule-based\ncompounds was searched since the late 80ies by\nexploiting the exchange pathways established between\norganic radicals. This research activity led, for instance, to\nthe discovery of LRMO at room temperature in Prussian\nblue analogues.64 In this class of materials, molecular\nbuilding blocks couple to form an extended 3d network.\nConversely, high-spin molecular clusters are usually\nisolated from each other by a shell of organic ligands that\nsurround their magnetic cores. In such a scenario, cluster\nspins in molecular crystals replace what ions are in\nconventional materials. Little is known, however, about\nthe collective magnetic behaviour of these nanostructured\nmaterials. Do they show phase transitions as conventional\nmagnets do? Magnetic correlations between the clusters\nare established by long-range dipole-dipole interactions.\nThe dipolar energy per molecular spin of an ordered\ncrystal is given by\n\nE dip =\n\nR\n2mk B\n\nm\n\n\u2211S\ni =1\n\ni\n\n\u22c5 Hi ,\n\n(6.1)\n\nwhere m is the number of molecular spins per magnetic\ncell, and Hi is the molecular field at site i, given by\n\n(\n\n)\n\nN \u23a7S\nS i \u22c5 rij rij \u23ab\u23aa\n\u23aa j\nH i = \u2212\u2211 \u23a8 3 \u2212 3\n\u23ac\nrij5\nj \u2260 i \u23aa rij\n\u23aa\u23ad\n\u23a9\n.\n\n(6.2)\n\nIn the limit of zero magnetic field and very-low\ntemperature (typically T < 1 K), dipole-dipole interactions\nbetween the molecular spins may induce a phase transition\nto LRMO.13,65\u221267 Much of the interest of current research\nin magnetic ordering is focused on this possibility because\nonly a few examples of purely dipolar magnets are known\nto date.18,19,68,69 It is worth noting that different critical\nbehaviours are expected depending on the nature of the\nmagnetic correlations. Assuming point-like magnetic\nunits, dipole-dipole interactions between them are\ncalculated without involving any adjustable parameter.\nTherefore, the macroscopic properties of dipolar magnets\ncan be precisely predicted.13,65\u221267 Such ideal materials are\nhowever very difficult to obtain. As often is the case,\nintermolecular superexchange interactions may not be\nnegligible at the very low temperatures where the LRMO\ntakes place. The consequence is that correlations between\nthe molecules are often established by quantummechanical superexchange interactions at short ranges,\nwhose macroscopic prediction is made difficult by their\nstrong dependence on electronic details. Indeed,\nintermolecular superexchange interactions were found to\nbe responsible for the observed LRMO in the high-spin\nmolecular clusters Fe 19,70 Mn4Br,71 Mn4Me,15 Fe14,22\nwhile they probably also play a major role in the case of\nMn12.72\nThe absence of any superexchange pathway between\nthe molecules is not the only pre-requisite needed for the\nexperimental observation of purely dipolar LRMO. An\nobvious requirement is that molecules should have large\nmolecular spins to lead to accessible ordering\ntemperatures. Another complication is added by the\n\ncluster magnetic anisotropy. As we have shown in Section\n5, the spin-lattice relaxation of clusters with large\nmagnetic anisotropy, such as Mn12 or Fe 8 becomes very\nslow below the blocking temperature TB. Furthermore,\ndipole-dipole interactions make the approach to\nequilibrium a collective, thus even slower, process.13,58\nThis situation makes it very difficult to investigate the\nequilibrium response. In addition, the cluster anisotropy\nenergies, favouring the molecular spin alignment along\ndictated directions, compete with the intermolecular\ncoupling. Although it has been shown theoretically 13 that\nthe occurrence of quantum tunnelling between opposite\nspin directions at temperatures below TB may in principle\nproduce sufficient fluctuations to overcome blocking, in\nmost of the investigated anisotropic molecules the times\ninvolved for the actual observation of the ensuing LRMO\nare still much too long. The only exception reported so far\nis represented by the Mn4Me molecular magnet which\nundergoes a transition to LRMO below TC = 0.21 K, 15 as\ndepicted in Fig. 11. In comparison with Mn4Cl reviewed\nin Section 5, Mn4Me has a lower symmetry,15 which\nresults in a larger tunnel splitting \u2206m, and therefore in an\nenhanced spin-lattice relaxation rate. Specific heat\nexperiments revealed indeed that for Mn4Me the thermal\nequilibrium is maintained down to the lowest\ntemperatures, enabling the observation of LRMO.\nNumerical simulations showed that the Mn4Me molecules\nare correlated by weak superexchange interactions besides\nthe dipolar ones.15a\nThe obvious and \"simplest\" way to look for LRMO\npurely driven by dipolar interactions, is to search for highspin molecular clusters with as low anisotropy as possible.\nThe Mn6 molecular cluster belongs to this class of\nmaterials.18 The magnetic core of the cluster is a highly\nsymmetric octahedron of Mn3+ ions ferromagnetically\ncoupled by strong superexchange interactions. The result\nis that Mn6 has a S = 12 spin ground state at lowtemperatures and very small magnetic anisotropy D \u2264 0.05\nK.18 Correspondently, the classical potential energy\nbarrier of Mn6 amounts to Ucl \u2248 DS2 = 1.5 K only. This\nvalue has to be compared with Ucl \u2248 70 K and 30 K found\nfor Mn12 and Fe8. We expected, and observed indeed, that\nthe spin-lattice relaxation of Mn6 remained sufficiently\nfast to enable specific heat measurements down to the\nordering temperature. A sharp peak in the specific heat\nwas reported18 at TC = 0.15 K. The experiment agreed well\nwith the specific heat calculated for a S = 12 Ising model\nof magnetic dipoles performed on a lattice magnetically\nequivalent to Mn6. The model included dipolar\ninteractions as well as the cluster anisotropy. This\nsimulation showed that the ground state of Mn6 is\nferromagnetically ordered.\nA step forward in the search of dipolar magnets is\nrepresented by the Fe17 molecular cluster,19,73 which\ncontains 17 Fe3+ ions per molecule linked via oxygen\natoms. Similarly to Mn6, Fe17 carries very-large spin\nground state and small cluster anisotropy. These values\nare S = 35/2 and D \u2245 0.02 K. respectively. In addition,\nmolecules are bound together in the crystal only by van\nder Waals forces prohibiting thus any intermolecular\nsuperexchange pathway. What makes Fe 17 an unique\nmodel system is that, by changing the crystallization\n\n\fconditions, it is possible to change the molecular packing\nwithout affecting the individual molecules, that is keeping\nthe surrounding ligands, the molecular high-spin ground\nstate and magnetic anisotropy unaltered. In other words,\nwith Fe17 it becomes feasible to tune the dipolar coupling\nbetween molecules with respect to the single-molecule\nproperties. The resulting interplay gives rise to\nmacroscopic behaviours ranging from superparamagnetic\nblocking to LRMO.19\nAs an example, Figure 12 shows the specific heat C\ncollected at several applied-fields for two Fe17\ncompounds, Fe 17-trigonal and Fe17-cubic, having trigonal\nand cubic symmetries, respectively. It can be noticed that\nboth compounds depend on the applied-field in an\nidentical manner regardless of the trigonal or cubic\nsymmetry. This implies that the Fe17 magnetic molecule\n(that is the spin ground state and anisotropy) is the same\nin both systems, as corroborated also by magnetization\ndata.19 The main difference in Fig. 12 is in the zeroapplied field data for which a \u03bb-type anomaly centred at\nTC = 0.81 K is observed for trigonal symmetry (inset of\nFig. 12). This feature reveals the onset of LRMO, the\nmagnetic nature is indeed proven by its disappearance\nupon application of H. Clearly, the \u03bb-type anomaly arises\non top of a much broader one, which shifts with\nincreasing applied-field towards higher temperatures.\nBecause of the small anisotropy (D \u2245 0.02 K), it is\nexpected that the magnetic contribution to C(T,H) for \u03bc0H\n\u2265 1 T is mainly due to Schottky-like Zeeman splittings of\nthe otherwise nearly degenerate energy spin states.\nIndeed, the calculated Schottky curves (solid lines) arising\nfrom the field-split levels accounts very well for the\nexperimental data. The same behaviour is followed by\nFe17-cubic except that no sign of LRMO is apparently\nobserved. As particularly evident in the low-T / high-H\nregion of Fig. 12, phonon modes contribute differently to\nC(T) of Fe17-trigonal and Fe17-cubic (dotted lines),\nreflecting the different geometries of the crystal lattice.\nFor Fe17-trigonal, numerical estimates of the dipolar\nenergy Edip agree well with the observed ordering\ntemperature TC = 0.81 K proving that the ordering is here\ndriven by dipole-dipole interactions. Contrary, the\nsymmetry of the molecules in Fe17-cubic is such that the\ncalculated Edip does not exceed the expected blocking\ntemperature of a superparamagnet with S = 35/2 and D \u2245\n0.02 K. We indeed note that the energy barrier of the Fe17\nmolecule is about eight times smaller than that of Mn12.8\nOne would expect, therefore, a blocking temperature of TB\n(Mn12)/8 \u2245 0.5 K, which indeed is what is observed for\nFe17-cubic\nby\nmeans\nof\nmagnetic\nrelaxation\nmeasurements.19\n\n7. The magnetocaloric effect\nMolecule-based materials compete at low-T with\nlanthanide and intermetallic compounds conventionally\nemployed as magnetic refrigerant materials. This is the\nscenario emerging from recent experimental results,20,21,22\nwhich show that the magnetocaloric effect (hereafter\nMCE), that is the cooling or heating in varying magnetic\nfields, may be enhanced in molecule-based materials. The\n\nMCE and the associated principle of adiabatic\ndemagnetization are readily understood from the top panel\nof Figure 13. Besides the fundamental interest on the\nMCE properties of novel materials, this effect is of\ntechnological importance since it can be used for cooling\napplications74 according to a process known as adiabatic\ndemagnetization.75 Before presenting any result, we point\nout that specific heat experiments are particularly suitable\nto study the MCE, since this effect is intimately related to\nthe thermodynamics.76\nNanostructured materials made of superparamagnetic\nclusters are particularly appealing in terms of MCE.77 This\nis because the usually large magnetic moments of the\nclusters are easily polarized by the applied-field providing\nlarge magnetic entropy changes. The picture depicted in\nFig. 13 is still valid for a superparamagnet with S as net\ncluster magnetic moment, provided that it is at\ntemperatures above the blocking temperature. The cluster\nmagnetic anisotropy, which indeed determines the\nblocking temperature, can be considered as a drawback in\nthe MCE efficiency of superparamagnets. Let us suppose\nto have three systems of non-interacting mono-disperse\nmagnetic clusters with spin S = 10 and hypothetical axial\nanisotropies D = 0.5, 1.5 and 3.0 K, respectively. Thus,\nwe first calculate the corresponding Schottky anomalies\nand then the magnetic entropy changes for a given field\nchange. The results for \u2206Sm are depicted in the lower\npanel of Fig. 13, where it can be noticed that increasing\nthe anisotropy tends to lower \u2206Sm (and similarly \u2206Tad) by\nshifting them towards higher temperatures. Moreover, it is\nimportant to consider that for temperatures below the\nblocking temperatures, the spin-lattice relaxation slows\ndown dramatically. Therefore, molecular spins tend to\nloose thermal contact with the lattice, as revealed for\ninstance by specific heat experiments,11,12,14,15 resulting in\nlower magnetic entropies and, consequently, lower MCE\nparameters. If one wants to search for better performances\nat low temperatures, preferred materials would then be\nmagnetic clusters with large S and small anisotropy.\nIn\ncomparison\nwith\nconventional\nmagnetic\nnanoparticles, molecular magnets have the advantage of\nbeing mono-disperse. It is easy to show, indeed, that the\nsize-distribution smears out the MCE response, yielding\ntherefore to a lower efficiency.78 The high-spin magnets\nFe8 and Mn12 were the first molecule-based materials to\nbe studied for enhanced MCE.20 Because of their highspin ground state S = 10, significant magnetic entropy\nchanges were observed to occur around the blocking\ntemperatures (\u2248 5 K). Based on magnetization data,\nTejada and co-workers observed a dependence of the\nmaximum magnetic entropy change on the sweep rate of\nthe applied field.20 For a magnetic system, the total\nentropy content is given by \u2206Sm/R = ln (2S+1). It is\ntherefore easy to show that Fe8 and Mn12, with their spin\nground state S = 10 well-defined at low temperatures,\ncannot have values of \u2206Sm larger than 12.5 and 11 J/kg K,\nrespectively. These values are however difficult to\nobserve because of the large anisotropies which are\npresent in both systems. Thus, for the reasons already\ndiscussed, Fe8 and Mn12 may not be considered ideal\nmaterials in terms of MCE. The search of nearly isotropic\nmolecular clusters led to the heterometallic octanuclear\n\n\frings of type Cr7Cd, that can be seen as an ordered\narrangement of well-separated paramagnetic spins, having\nfast relaxations in the whole (experimental) temperature\nrange. By means of specific heat experiments, the cooling\nefficiency of Cr7Cd was reported21 to be in the\ntemperature range below 2 K. In terms of MCE\nparameters, the only limitation of this material is given by\nthe molecular spin value itself (S = 3/2) allowing not more\nthan \u2212\u2206Sm = 5.1 J/kg K.\nThe above-reported values of the magnetic entropy\nchange expressed in J/kg K units, are significantly large\nand competing with the performance of more conventional\nintermetallic compounds based on lanthanide elements.74\nCan magnetic molecules do even better?\nThe recently 79 synthesized molecular cluster of type\nFe14, possessing a spin value as large as S = 25 and a\nrelatively small cluster magnetic anisotropy seemed prone\nto be an ideal choice. A full investigation,22 both\nexperimentally and theoretically, of the magnetocaloric\nproperties of this molecule is summarized in Figure 14.\nThe specific heat data reveals the existence of a phase\ntransition below TN = 1.87 K to a long-range magnetically\nordered state. This implies a relatively small cluster\nmagnetic anisotropy, otherwise superparamagnetic\nblocking above TN should be observed. However, even a\nsmall anisotropy may become important for a S as large as\nthat of Fe14. This is reflected, for instance, in the relative\nheight of the transition peak at TN that apparently is a bit\ntoo small for such a large spin value, suggesting that a\nlarge portion of the magnetic entropy is not available for\nthe ordering mechanism. The data measured above 20 K\nshow a large increase, that we associate with the lattice\ncontribution. From the specific heat data, we evaluate\nboth \u2206Sm and \u2206Tad. The results, depicted in the lower\npanel of Fig. 14, show that \u2206Sm is exceptionally large\nreaching the respectable value of 5.0 R or equivalently\n17.6 J/kg K for \u03bc0\u2206H = 7 T, and surprisingly exceeding\neven the entropy expected for a S = 25 spin system, that is\nR ln(2S+1) = 3.9 R. This apparent contradiction was\nresolved by modelling the exchange interactions between\nthe single-ion spins inside the Fe14 cluster. It was then\nfound a high degree of frustration which led to associate\nthe excess of experimental magnetic entropy with the\npresence of low-lying net spin states close in energy to the\nS = 25 ground state.22a For the temperature range below\n10 K, the reported \u2206Sm and \u2206Tad values are better than that\nof intermetallic compounds. One of the best\nrepresentatives, for instance, is the recently80 studied (Er1x Dy x )Al 2 alloy that, for x > 0.5 concentrations and T < 10\nK, presents a \u2212\u2206Sm which is at least 30% smaller than that\nof Fe 14. The temperature range of efficiency of Fe14 (T <\n10 K) is easily accessible in any research laboratory with\nliquid 4He. The Fe14 molecular cluster turns out to be\ntherefore a fine cooling material to achieve very-low\ntemperatures by adiabatic demagnetization.\nRefrigerant materials that are suitable for operations at\nhigh temperatures attract the interest of a large number of\nresearchers working in the field of magnetic\nrefrigeration.74 Room-temperature magneto-cryocoolers\nare expected to be commercially available in a near future.\nMolecule-based magnetic materials did not enter in this\ncontest so far. To search for molecular clusters with larger\n\nand larger anisotropies will not finally pay back for the\nreasons discussed above so one needs to find other\nstrategies. Generally speaking, one may try to involve\nmore degrees of freedom of a molecular system thus\nincreasing the molar entropy involved. These degrees of\nfreedom need, however, to be tuneable by an external\nmagnetic field. An alternative route to follow is to\nstrengthen the intermolecular magnetic correlations which\nultimately will give rise to long-range magnetic order (the\nmagnetic entropy change is maximized when the material\nis near its magnetic ordering temperature). In this respect,\nextended molecule-based systems like the Prussian blue\nanalogues are of particular interest since magnetic phase\ntransitions up to room temperature have been reported for\nthis class of compounds. 64 Specific heat and\nmagnetization experiments have already been performed\non selected Prussian blue analogues, revealing\nencouraging magnetic entropy changes for temperatures\nabove 200 K.23\n\n8. Open questions and perspectives\nMolecule-based magnetic materials have given new\nimpetus to the subject of specific heat. Fundamental\nphenomena have been discovered or at least corroborated\nby specific heat measurements. Indeed, the selected\nexamples here reviewed show that this subject of\ninvestigation is very successful if applied to this class of\nmaterials, and complementary to magnetization and\nspectroscopy techniques.\nA charm of molecule-based materials resides on the\nvariety of hierarchies of the magnetic interactions and\nsymmetries of the magnetic structure that is not\nachievable in intermetallic compounds and probably not\neven in other physical systems. This makes them very\nappealing for magnetothermal investigations, since\nmagnetic correlations, either short- or long-range, are\npromptly detected by a specific heat experiment.\nMechanisms of magnetic order in these materials have\nindeed attracted much interest so far, especially in systems\nwith low magnetic dimensionality,81 in which the ordering\nis driven by exchange as well as dipolar interactions. The\ncase of pure dipolar magnetism, so seldom encountered in\nNature (see Section 6), is one of the most challenging, i.e.,\nfor the determination of the critical exponents of the\nspecific heat at the phase transition. A further interesting\ntopic is the possible occurrence of a quantum phase\ntransition at very low temperatures. 72 It is not clear\nwhether an anomaly in the specific heat and the\ncorresponding critical exponent can be measured in these\ncases but certainly magnetothermal investigations may\nprovide fundamental information on the low temperature\nphase diagram of ordered molecular spin systems. The\ndifficulties are not negligible and at the moment the main\nconstrains seem to be related to the size of the available\ncrystals on one side and to the very low temperature\nneeded.\nThe dynamics of a spin system embedded in a\nenvironment made of phonons, nuclear and electronic\nspins, will probably continue to attract much attention and\nsome of the issues related to this topic are addressable by\n\n\fmagnetothermal investigations as depicted by the\nexamples previously discussed. Yet, since a fundamental\nrole is played by phonons and nuclear spins, one may\nwonder whether in certain conditions it can be possible\nand even more convenient to monitor directly the phonon\nor the nuclear contributions to the specific heat in order to\nfind anomalies on those sides too. For instance, it would\nbe of interest to investigate whether a non canonical\ndistribution of phonons, like in a phonon bottleneck, may\ngive rise to detectable anomalies in the thermal properties\nof the electron spins. More in general, the study of\nthermal properties has well evidenced that little is still\nknown on the energy spectrum and on the properties of\nthe molecular lattice, so any theoretical or experimental\neffort in this direction is certainly worth.\nIn spite of the fact that molecule-based materials have\nbeen so far scarcely investigated for magneto-cooling\napplications, results have already shown that they\nrepresent a valid alternative to conventional materials, at\nleast at low temperatures. Investigations are presently\ndeterming the MCE of these materials by direct\nmagnetothermal methods,82 and exploring possibilities of\napplications and different routes to enhance the MCE even\nfurther.\nBecause of their appeal, we expect future developments\nin the topics sketched above to be rapidly forthcoming.\n\nAcknowledgements\nA special thank goes to J.

The lattice contribution dominates at high temperature and scales\nas T 2.69; the Schottky anomaly is clearly visible at low-T and can be fitted to a simple model (green continuos curve) with two\nlevels (a lower singlet and an upper triplet) separated by an energy gap of 4.56 K. If levels up to the fifth excited multiplet are\nconsidered and parameters are fixed by magnetic measurements, the blue dotted curve is obtained. At very low T, an upturn\nscaling as T \u22122 is observed and ascribed to the hyperfine interaction with the neighbouring nuclei.\n\n\fFig. 3 Magnetic field dependence of the isothermal heat capacity measured on a Cr8 single crystals at 0.78 K.

Under adiabatic conditions (i.e. when the total entropy of the system remains constant during the\nmagnetic field change), the magnetic entropy change must be compensated for by an equal but opposite change of the entropy\nassociated with the lattice, resulting in a change in temperature of the material. That is, the adiabatic field change from Hi to\nHf brings the system to state B(Tf,Hf) with the temperature change \u2206Tad = Tf \u2013 Ti (horizontal arrow). If alternatively the\nmagnetic field is isothermally changed to Hf in a reversible process, the system goes to state C(Tf,Hf) with the magnetic\nentropy change \u2206Sm (vertical arrow). It is easy to see that if the magnetic change \u2206H \uf020reduces the entropy (\u2206Sm < 0), then \u2206Tad\nis positive, whereas if \u2206H is such that \u2206Sm > 0, then \u2206Tad < 0.
