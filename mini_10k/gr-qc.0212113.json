We call the second-order symmetric tensor field h\u03bc\u03bd , which\nrepresents deviation from a flat space (g\u03bc\u03bd = \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd + h\u03bc\u03bd ), as a \"graviton\". Multi-graviton\ntheories have been studied by Boulanger et al. [2, 3]. They have shown that there is no\nconsistent interaction of gravitons and the possible action is a sum of replicated Pauli-Fierz\nactions [4].\nIn this paper, we consider a model for a multi-graviton theory with nearest-neighbor\ncouplings in the theory space. To be precise, the gravitons are not interacting each other\nin our model, but they have a discrete mass spectrum. The simplest model is explained in\nSec. II. In the limit of a large number of gravitons, the mass spectrum of gravitons resembles\nthat of the Kaluza-Klein (KK) theory. Therefore our model is equivalent to the KK theory\nwith a discretized dimension.\nThe emergence mechanisms of a space dimension have been suggested in refs. [5, 6, 7],\nwhich is in the stream of dimensional deconstruction [8, 9]. Recently the authors have been\ninformed of ref. [10], in which the gravity with the theory space is also argued. Although\nour model for the gravitation theory with a discretized dimension is very simple, it may\nbe a toy model adequate for studying qualitative features of more complicated theory and\nmechanisms included in it.\nFor example, we evaluate the vacuum energy in our model in Sec. III. We also consider\na model in the continuous (4 + \u03b4) dimensional space-time with a discretized dimension.\nWe show that an arbitrary small amount of positive vacuum energy can be obtained if\n(4 + \u03b4) = 6, 10, . . ..\n\nII.\n\nMULTI-GRAVITON THEORY AND A LATTICIZED DIMENSION\n\nThe lagrangian for a massless spin-two field can be written as\n1\n1\nL0 = \u2212 \u2202\u03bb h\u03bc\u03bd \u2202 \u03bb h\u03bc\u03bd + \u2202\u03bb h\u03bb \u03bc \u2202\u03bd h\u03bd\u03bc \u2212 \u2202\u03bc h\u03bc\u03bd \u2202\u03bd h + \u2202\u03bb h\u2202 \u03bb h ,\n2\n2\nwhere h \u2261 h\u03bc\u03bc . This corresponds with the weak-field limit of the Einstein gravity.\n\n2\n\n(1)\n\n\fThe lagrangian for a massive graviton with the St\u00fcckerberg fields [11] is known as [12]\nLm = L0 \u2212\n\nm2\n1\n(h\u03bc\u03bd h\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 h2 ) \u2212 2(mA\u03bc + \u2202 \u03bc \u03c6)(\u2202 \u03bd h\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bc h) \u2212 (\u2202\u03bc A\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bd A\u03bc )2 ,\n2\n2\n\n(2)\n\nwhere a constant m corresponds to the mass of graviton. We have omitted here the gauge\nfixing term as well as the ghost terms. The lagrangian (2) is invariant under the following\ntransformations:\nh\u03bc\u03bd \u2192 h\u03bc\u03bd + \u2202\u03bc \u03be\u03bd + \u2202\u03bd \u03be\u03bc ,\n\n(3)\n\nA\u03bc \u2192 A\u03bc + m\u03be\u03bc \u2212 \u2202\u03bc \u03b6 ,\n\n(4)\n\n\u03c6 \u2192 \u03c6 + m\u03b6 ,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u03be and \u03b6 are local parameters.\nNext we consider a multi-graviton (N-graviton) theory [2, 3] given by the lagrangian\nL\u03040 =\n\nN \u0014\nX\n\nk=1\n\n1\n1\n\u2212 \u2202\u03bb hk\u03bc\u03bd \u2202 \u03bb hk \u03bc\u03bd + \u2202\u03bb hk \u03bb \u03bc \u2202\u03bd hk \u03bd\u03bc \u2212 \u2202\u03bc hk \u03bc\u03bd \u2202\u03bd hk + \u2202\u03bb hk \u2202 \u03bb hk .\n2\n2\n\u0015\n\n(6)\n\nIt can be said that a massless graviton lives in each \"theory space\", which is labeled by k.\nNow, instead of adding the mere mass term to the lagrangian (6), we put the term\nincluding couplings of other gravitons with the nearest-neighbor suffix:\nL\u0304m\n\nN h\ni\nm2 X\n2\nk\nk+1 2\n= L\u03040 \u2212\n(hk\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 hk+1\n)\n\u03bc\u03bd ) \u2212 (h \u2212 h\n2 k=1\n\n\u22122\n\nN h\nX\n\nk=1\n\ni\n\nm(Ak \u03bc \u2212 Ak\u22121 \u03bc ) + \u2202 \u03bc \u03c6k (\u2202 \u03bd hk\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bc hk ) \u2212\n\nN\n1X\n(\u2202\u03bc Ak\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bd Ak\u03bc )2 .\n2 k=1\n\n(7)\n\nIn this notation, one should read as hk+N = hk , h0 = hN , hN +1 = h1 , and so on.\nIt is interesting to see that the multi-graviton lagrangian is invariant under the transformations:\nhk\u03bc\u03bd \u2192 hk\u03bc\u03bd + \u2202\u03bc \u03be\u03bdk + \u2202\u03bd \u03be\u03bck ,\nAk\u03bc \u2192 Ak\u03bc + m\u03be\u03bck \u2212 m\u03be\u03bck+1 \u2212 \u2202\u03bc \u03b6 k ,\n\u03c6k \u2192 \u03c6k + m\u03b6 k \u2212 m\u03b6 k\u22121 .\n\n(8)\n\nAs in the case with 5D QED studied by Hill and Leibovich [13], N \u2212 1 massive gravitons\nand one massless graviton are described by the lagrangian. The eigenvalues for the mass\nmatrix are\nMp2\n\n2\n\n= 4m sin\n\n2\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03c0p\nN\n\n\u0013\n\n3\n\n(p = 1, . . . , N) .\n\n(9)\n\n\fMassive vector and scalar fields are absorbed by the massive graviton fields by means of the\ntransformations (8) and then they have correct spin-degree of freedom, five.\nOn the other hand, massless vector and scalar fields are survived. The massless degree\nof freedom of the spin-two, one, zero fields are described as\nN\n1 X\nh\u0304\u03bc\u03bd = \u221a\nhk\u03bc\u03bd ,\nN k=1\n\nN\n1 X\n\u0100\u03bc = \u221a\nAk\u03bc ,\nN k=1\n\nN\n1 X\n\u03c6\u0304 = \u221a\n\u03c6k .\nN k=1\n\n(10)\n\nWhen we make the following combination\nH\u03bc\u03bd = h\u0304\u03bc\u03bd + \u03c6\u0304\u03b7\u03bc\u03bd ,\n\n(11)\n\nit becomes a massless graviton and then the kinetic term of \u03c6\u0304 takes a canonical form [12].\nWe find that the field content of our model is very akin to the one of the KK theory [14].\nSuppose that we considered the five-dimensional metric as\nds2 = (\u03b7\u03bc\u03bd + h\u03bc\u03bd )dx\u03bc dx\u03bd \u2212 2A\u03bc dx\u03bc dy + (1 + 2\u03c6)dy 2 ,\n\n(12)\n\nor\nA\u03bc = h\u03bcy ,\n\n\u03c6 = hyy .\n\n(13)\n\nWhen we take the weak-field limit of the five-dimensional Einstein-Hilbert action, the lagrangian density appears to be of the form (7), provided that the derivative with respect to\nthe extra dimensional coordinate y is replaced by the difference operation, namely\nh\u03bc\u03bd (x, y + \u01eb) \u2212 h\u03bc\u03bd (x, y)\n\u2202h\u03bc\u03bd\n\u2212\u2192 \u2206y h\u03bc\u03bd \u2261\n,\n\u2202y\n\u01eb\n\n(14)\n\nand we define hk\u03bc\u03bd (x) \u2261 h\u03bc\u03bd (x, k\u01eb) with \u01eb = m\u22121 .\nThe mass spectrum and spin degrees of freedom in the KK theory have been explained by\nref. [15]. Our multi-graviton model can be regarded as a discrete version of the KK theory.\nThus the transformation (8) can also be derived in the similar manner to ref. [15].\nThe simplest way to get actions for multi-graviton system is the discretization of extra\ndimensions in generalized KK theories. The counting of the four-dimensional fields can\nbe done by the completely parallel way to the analysis in ref. [16, 17]. If we consider the\ndiscretized version of the KK theory in M4 \u2297 T d (where M4 denotes the four-dimensional\n\nMinkowsky spacetime and T d is a d dimensional torus), we obtain a tower of massive spintwo states, (d \u2212 1) tower of massive spin-one states, and d(d \u2212 1)/2 tower of massive spinless\n4\n\n\fstates. As well, we obtain the following massless states: one spin-two, d spin-one, and\nd(d + 1)/2 spinless states.\nIt is an important problem whether all of the field contents are necessary or not in the view\nof the four-dimensional gravity. In other words, we are interested in the possibility of the\nmulti-graviton theory whose continuum limit does not coincide with a higher-dimensional\ntheory. Particularly, the presence of the massless vector and scalar fields are unwanted when\nwe wish to consider a phenomenological model. Attempts to solve this problem by imposing\ndiscrete symmetries in the theory space and discretization of non-abelian KK theories will\nbe considered elsewhere.\n\nIII.\n\nVACUUM ENERGY\n\nIn this section, we evaluate the one-loop vacuum energy density in the model of the\nprevious section. We will also offer an extension of the model, which includes both latticized\nand continuous extra dimensions, and the vacuum energy is estimated in the model.\nRecently, the scenarios explaining the small positive cosmological constant in the present\nuniverse (10\u221247 GeV4 , according to [18]) are discussed through the study of the Casimir-like\nenergy in the higher-dimensional theories [19, 20]. Because the latticized model would have\ndifferent UV behavior from that of continuum model, we expect a novel expression of the\ncosmological constant.\nFirst, we consider one scalar degree of freedom which has the mass spectrum discussed in\nthe previous section. Then the vacuum energy density in the one-loop calculation is written\nby the zeta-function technique [21] as\n1\n1 d\u03b6(s)\nln det[\u2212\u22072 + Mp2 ] = \u2212\n2\n2 ds\nwhere\n\n,\n\n(15)\n\ns=0\n\nXZ \u221e\n\u03bc2s\n\u03b6(s) =\ndt ts\u22123 exp(\u2212Mp2 t) ,\n16\u03c0 2\u0393(s) p 0\n\n(16)\n\nwith\nMp2 = 4m2 sin2\nHere the constant \u03bc has the dimension of mass.\n\n5\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03c0p\nN\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n(17)\n\n\fThe calculation of the zeta function can be done by the similar method used in refs. [22,\n23]. Using the formula\nh\n\ni\n\n2t\n\nexp \u22124m2 sin2 (\u03b8/2)t = e\u22122m\n\n\u221e\nX\n\ncos l\u03b8 Il (2m2 t) ,\n\n(18)\n\nl=\u2212\u221e\n\nwhere I\u03bd (x) is the modified Bessel function, we can write the zeta function as\n\u221e\nX X\n\u03bc2s\n2\u03c0pl Z \u221e\n2\n\u03b6(s) =\ndt ts\u22123 e\u22122m t Il (2m2 t) .\ncos\n2\n(4\u03c0) \u0393(s) p l=\u2212\u221e\nN\n0\n\n(19)\n\nFor simplicity, we assume N \u2265 3.

[25], we require the invariance of V with respect to the scale \u03bc\u0304 and we\nchoose VR (\u03bc\u0304R ) = 0 for a normalization point \u03bc\u0304R .

The boundary condition VR (\u03bc\u0304R ) = 0 can be interpreted\nas the expectation that the new physics forces the vacuum energy or cosmological constant\nto vanish at such a high-energy scale.\nLet us consider the extension of our model to the one with 4 + \u03b4 dimensional continuous\nspacetime. Here the extra \u03b4 dimensional space is taken as (S 1 )\u03b4 with a common radius b.\nOne can regard the new model as the theory with a latticized circle and \u03b4 continuous circles.\nIn this model the mass spectrum of the gravitons is expressed as\n2\nMp,n\n\n2\n\n= 4m sin\n\n2\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03c0p\nn2\n+ 2 ,\nN\nb\n\u0013\n\n(27)\n\nwhere n = (n1 , n2 , . . . , n\u03b4 ) and all the components take integer values.\nUsing the Poisson resummation formula\nX\nn\n\nn2\nexp \u2212 2 t =\nb\n!\n\n\u03c0b2\nt\n\n!\u03b4/2\n\nX\nn\n\n\u03c0 2 b2 n2\nexp \u2212\nt\n\n!\n\n,\n\n(28)\n\nwe can express the zeta function, in which in the present time the summation over n is\ninvolved, as\n\u03bc2s N(2\u03c0b)\u03b4 X\n\u03b6(s) =\n(4\u03c0)2+\u03b4/2 \u0393(s) n\n+2\n\n\u221e Z\nX\n\nq=1\n\n\u221e\n\n0\n\n\u0014Z\n\n\u221e\n\n0\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\ndt ts\u2212\u03b4/2\u22123 exp \u22122m2 t \u2212 \u03c0 2 b2 n2 /t I0 (2m2 t)\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n\uf8f9\n\ndt ts\u2212\u03b4/2\u22123 exp \u22122m2 t \u2212 \u03c0 2 b2 n2 /t IqN (2m2 t)\uf8fb .\n\n(29)\n\nIf \u03b4 is odd, all the terms in the parentheses are finite and lead to no logarithm term in the\nvacuum energy. The vacuum energy can be found to be finite and negative in this case, as\nin the case of the KK theory with torus compactification. Thus we assume that \u03b4 is even.\nFor even \u03b4, in the limit s \u2192 0, only the first term with n = 0 is divergent in the\nparentheses on the right hand side of (29) if N is larger than 2 + \u03b4/2. Thus, after taking\naccount of the degrees of freedom, the vacuum energy density in our extended model takes\nthe form\n\u0393( 5+\u03b4\n)\n\u03bc\u03042\n(5 + \u03b4)(2 + \u03b4)N m4\n2 2 \u03b4/2\n2\nln\n(4\u03c0m\nb\n)\nV = VR \u2212 (\u22121)\u03b4/2\n\u221a\n4\u03c0 2\n4m2\n\u03c0\u0393(3 + 2\u03b4 )2\nwhere\n\n\u03bc\u03042\nln\n4m2\n\n!\n\n\u03bc2\n= ln\n4m2\n\n!\n\n!\n\n+ 2\u03c8(3 + \u03b4/2) \u2212 \u03c8(5/2 + \u03b4/2) + \u03b3 ,\n7\n\n\u2212*** ,\n\n(30)\n\n(31)\n\n\f(\u03b3 is the Euler's constant) and . . . means the positive finite terms.\nAs seen from the sign of logarithmic term, we can obtain the positive vacuum energy after\ntaking account of the renormalization discussed above; in other words, we have the positive\ncosmological constant when \u03b4 = 4k + 2 (k = 0, 1, 2, . . .), such as \u03b4 = 2 (D = 4 + \u03b4 = 6),\n\u03b4 = 6 (D = 10), and so on.\nWe will further investigate the possibility of the arbitrarily small cosmological constant.\nSince the contribution from the finite q terms in the zeta function can be estimated as at\nmost O(N \u22124 ), it can be neglected if a large N is assumed. Further if mb \u226a 1, we find\n\u0393( 5+\u03b4\n)\n(5 + \u03b4)(2 + \u03b4)N m4\n\u03bc\u03042R\n2 2 \u03b4/2\n2\nln\nV \u2248\n(4\u03c0m\nb\n)\n\u221a\n4\u03c0 2\n4m2\n\u03c0\u0393(3 + \u03b42 )2\n4+\u03b4\n(5 + \u03b4)(2 + \u03b4)N\n\u0393\n\u2212\n(4+\u03b4)/2\n4\n4\u03c0\n(2\u03c0b)\n2\n\n!\n\nX\n\nn6=0\n\n1\n(n2 )(4+\u03b4)/2\n\n!\n\n(mb \u226a 1).\n\n(32)\n\nTherefore when (2\u03c0mb)4+\u03b4 ln(\u03bc\u0304R /m) \u2248 O(1), an arbitrary small vacuum energy can be\nobtained. Note that the condition does not include N in this approximation.\nThe difficulty of the present model in this section is the problem of tuning the scale of\nthe extra dimensions. The model does not provide a mechanism to determine the value of\nb, because there is no minimum value of V as a function of b. We should consider either the\nvalue of b is due to the other mechanism or b takes an appropriate value only in the present\nuniverse. For the latter case, the motion of b may play a role of quintessence or dark energy,\nas similar to the suggestion in ref. [26]. This possibility will be considered elsewhere.\nIn this paper, we only considered the vacuum energy at the one-loop level. Even at the\nsame level, the correction to the Newton constant may also be induced in general. This\nwould be related with the restriction or determination of the scale of the extra dimensions\nas well as the scale of m.\nWe should investigate the nature of coupling to the matter fields and the back reaction\nproblem in the case with a small cosmological constant. Through such studies, the case with\nstrong gravity will also be revealed.\nFinally, we remember that we have not treated the hierarchy problem in this paper. It will\nbe clarified by the further study whether incorporating supersymmetry (and its break-down)\ninto the model is necessary or not.\n\n8\n\n\fAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors thank the Yukawa Institute for Theoretical Physics at Kyoto University.\nDiscussions during the YITP workshop YITP-W-02-18 on \"Quantum Field Theories: Fundamental Problems and Applications\" were useful to complete this work.\nWe would like to thank K.
