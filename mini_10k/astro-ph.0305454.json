On the other hand, before the recombination time the cosmic\nplasma is strongly fluctuating at the large scales due to the gravitational\ndensity perturbation. These plasma density fluctuations can play a role of\nrandomly distributed scatterers for the electromagnetic fields and make it\nimpossible for the electromagnetic fields to propagate if the wave length is\nlonger than the elastic mean free path of electromagnetic wave by the scatterers. The localized modes are thermally excited and the electric field is more\nor less aligned in the localization region. The localization phenomenon by\nrandom fields was first proposed by Anderson [13] to explain the behavior of\nthe electric resistivity of metals in the presence of impurities and the theories\nwere developed by himself and his collaborators [14],[15]. The localization\nphenomena were then observed in various physical systems. Probably the\nfirst paper which studied the possible localization of electromagnetic field in\nplasma is the Ref. [16] (see also [17]). Roughly speaking, the Anderson localization phenomenon occurs because of the destructive interference of the\nincident wave and the scattered waves from the randomly distributed sources.\nIt is known that the localization occurs if the strength of the randomness is\nlarger than a critical value. For a sufficiently large random potential, only\nthe modes of the wave length shorter than the mean free path can propagate, while the other modes are localized. The authors of Ref. [18] argue\nthat this localization phenomenon should occur in the matter dominated era\n(before the recombination time) in the standard cosmology. The authors of\n[18] took into account a single (Jeans) scale lc for the primordial perturbation\nfor simplicity. Inclusion of a scale invariant spectrum for scales larger than\nlc produces a hierarchy of structures, which needs in a multifractal description. During the past decade, multifractality of critical eigenfunctions at the\nAnderson transition has been a subject of intensive analytical and numerical\nstudies (see Refs. [19]-[27] and references therein). A remarkable virtue of the\nAnderson localization mechanism is that the photon diffusion does not occur\nto the localized mode. This makes the localized structures to be imprinted\nin the photon gas after the decoupling of the photon gas (so-called cosmic\nmicrowave background, or CMB) from the baryonic matter. In the present\npaper we will show that results of the numerical simulations of multifractal\nAnderson localization are consistent with the CMB data.\n2\n\n\f2\n\nAnderson localization of cosmic electromagnetic fields\n\nLet us, following to the paper [18], consider Anderson localization of cosmic electromagnetic fields for the spatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker\nUniverse. We assume that the charged particles are non-relativistic. So the\nfour velocity of the charged particles: u\u03b1 = (a\u22121 , v i ), with v i being small\ncompared with unity. Equation for the vector potential A in terms of the\nconformal comoving coordinates (\u03bb, x) in this case is\n\u22022A \u22022A\ne2 na2\n+\n=\nA\n\u2202\u03bb2\n\u2202x2\nm\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03bb is the conformal time defined by \u03bb = t dta , m is the electron mass\nand e is the charge, n is the density.\nSplit the plasma density n into the homogeneous part n and the space\ndependent random part \u03b4n;\nn = n + \u03b4n\n(2)\nR\n\nThen the right hand side of the plasma equation becomes\n\u03c9prec2 \u03c9prec2 \u03b4n\n+\n]A\n[\na\na n\nq\n\n(3)\n\n2\n\n. Here we have used the conservation law: n = nrec /a3\nwhere \u03c9prec = e mnrec\ne\nbefore the recombination time, with the scale factor a normalized at the recombination time. nrec is the electron density (therefore the baryon density)\nat the recombination time. The first term in the bracket is spatially constant\nbut a decreasing function of the conformal time \u03bb. The second term represents the fluctuating random environment induced by the baryonic density\nb\nperturbation \u03b4\u03c1\nwhich is equal to \u03b4n\nin our non-relativistic case. Knowing the\n\u03c1b\nn\nb\n= \u03b4\u03c1\n\u221da\nstandard theory of linear perturbation in cosmology we see that \u03b4n\nn\n\u03c1b\nin the matter dominated era, so that the second term is independent of the\n\u03c9 rec\n\n2\n\n,\nconformal time in that era. We write the random potential as V (x) \u2261 pa \u03b4n\nn\nwhich is a function of comoving coordinates x only. So far we have discussed\n3\n\n\fthe period after the equal time1 and before the recombination time and found\nthat the random potential induced by the density perturbation is constant\nin time. As we shall see this is important for the stability of the Anderson\nlocalization. For the matter dominated\nuniverse, the scale factor is given by\nR dt\nt 2/3\n1/3\na(t) = ( trec\n)\n= ( 3t\u03bbrec )2 with \u03bb = a(t)\n= t2/3\n. One can reduce the\nrec 3t\nMaxwell equations to the following wave equation as\n\u22022A \u22022A\n+\n= [Q2 /\u03bb2 + V (x)]A\n2\n2\n\u2202\u03bb\n\u2202x\n\n(4)\n\nHere Q2 = 9t2rec \u03c9prec 2 . We expand the vector potential A in terms of the\ncomplete orthonormal set {\u03c8n } as\nA=\n\nX\n\nan fn (\u03bb)\u03c8n (x) + c.c.\n\n(5)\n\nwith an being arbitrary coefficients. Here \u03c8n (x) is a normalized solution of\nthe eigenvalue equation:\n[\u2212\u2206 + V (x)]\u03c8n (x) = En2 \u03c8n (x)\n\n(6)\n\nLocalization means that a number of modes {\u03c8n , n \u2264 n0 } are bound\nstates exponentially falling off at infinity. The marginal state n0 corresponds\nto the so-called mobility edge as we shall explain further.\nHere we only consider the adiabatic baryonic density perturbation for\nsimplicity, the spectrum of which is roughly like the picture below. To simplify our discussion we assume in this section that the spectrum is sharply\npeaked around the Jeans length lc at the equal time and the distribution of\nperturbation is Gaussian. Inclusion of the scale invariant spectrum for scales\nlarger than lc produces a hierarchy of structures (see next section).\nTo understand the Anderson localization in the Universe before the recombination time, we have to evaluate the mobility edge of the wave number,\nwhich is roughly the inverse of the mean free path lmf of the electromagnetic\nwave by the random potential. Consider a Schr\u00f6dinger equation for the spatial part of the electromagnetic field:\n[\u2212\u2206 + V (x)]\u03c8 = E 2 \u03c8\n1\n\n(7)\n\nThe equal time teq is the time when the matter and radiation energy density are\nrec )\nequal. This value depends on the value of the present baryon density. We take a(t\na(teq ) =\n( ttrec\n)2/3 = 6 as a typical value for \u03a90 = 0.2.\neq\n\n4\n\n\fwith x being the comoving coordinates. Recall that the random potential\nV (x) = \u03c9prec2 \u03b4n\ndoes not depend on the conformal time in the matter domn\ninated era. The characteristic length scale lc of the density perturbation is\ngiven by the Jeans length at the equal time, which is roughly the same as\nthe horizon scale at that time. After that time the length scale lc develops\nas \u221d a. This gives lc \u2248 1023 cm at the recombination time, while the horizon\nis \u2248 2 \u00d7 1023 cm. Then the mean free path is given by lmf = n1c \u03c3 where \u03c3\nis the elastic scattering cross section of the electromagnetic wave by a single\n3 \u22123\npotential and nc \u2248 4\u03c0\nlc is the density of \"impurities\". The elastic cross section is estimated roughly as \u2248 4\u03c0lc2 by the standard wave mechanics, because\nthe \"energy\" is low and is roughly given by E 2 lc2 \u2248 1, while the potential\nis effectively gigantic V \u00d7 lc2 \u2248 \u03c9p 2 \u03b4n\nl2 \u2248 5 \u00d7 1032 . Here we have taken\nn c\n\u03b4n\n\u22125\n\u2248 10 because the assumed baryonic perturbation can be comparable to\nn\nthe temperature fluctuation of CMB observed by COBE (see [28] and next\nsection). However, the localization length and other results in the present\nconsideration are insensitive to the magnitude of the density perturbation.\nTherefore the localization should occur, since the critical value of V lc2 will\nbe of order one. Then the mean free path is given by lmf \u2248 lc /3 and the\n, which is consistent with our low energy picture.\nmobility edge is E \u2217 \u2248 12\u03c0\nlc\nFortunately in the present case, the randomness is huge so that an estimate of the localization length is available [30]. We have \u03be = lc / log(|V |/E 2 ),\nwhere lc is the minimum length scale in which range the potential can be\nconsidered as a constant. For the adiabatic baryonic perturbation, it will be\nreasonable to take the Jeans length at the equal time teq as the small scale\ncut-off lc , which is \u2248 1023 cm at the recombination time. In the present case,\n|V |/E 2 \u2248 5 \u00d7 1032 so that \u03be \u2248 1021 cm at the recombination time.\nOne can estimate the magnitude of the thermally excited localized electric fields as E2loc \u2248 T /\u03be 3 in a localization region of the size \u03be. Here the\ncontribution from a single localized mode only has been taken into account,\nbecause the peaks of the other localized modes are randomly distributed and\nwill be located outside of the region under consideration. The estimate of\nE2loc can be derived, for instance, by the equal partition law. Note that the\npropagating modes(n > n0 ) contribute to the Stefan-Boltzmann law. At this\nstage we realize that approximately T /\u03c9p photons occupies a localized state.\nAs far as T /\u03c9p >> 1, a coherent localized state of the size \u03be is a good picture\n\n5\n\n\fso that we can approximately describe it by a classical field:\nEloc = \u2212\n\nn0 q\nX\n\nT /\u03c9p f \u0307n (\u03bb)en (x)\u03c8n (x) + c.c.\n\n(8)\n\nwhere en (x) is the polarization vector, which is perpendicular to the gradient\nof the wave function \u03c8n (x). Therefore, in a localization domain of the size\n\u03be in the cosmic plasma, we have aligned electric and magnetic fields, which\nare perpendicular to each other and oscillate almost at the plasma frequency.\nOne might worry about the damping of the electromagnetic structure of the\nsize \u03be by photon diffusion. However, the diffusion does not occur to the\nlocalized modes. This is one of the virtues of the Anderson localization\nmechanism. Since the localization is a delicate interference phenomenon, the\nrandom potential V (x) should vary slowly so that the motion of wave packet\nis not disturbed [16]. This condition is met before the recombination time.\nIn the previous consideration we, following to [18], only took into account a\nsingle scale lc for the primordial perturbation for simplicity. The contribution\nfrom the larger scales to the localization phenomenon is interesting in the\nsense that it may account for the hierarchy of the structures.\n\n3\n\nMultifractal Anderson localization\n\nEven arbitrary close to the mobility edge a state should occupy only an\ninfinitesimal fraction of space if it is to be labeled a localized state. On the\nother side of the mobility edge the states should extend through the whole\nvolume. Both characteristics can be accommodated at the mobility edge if\none assumes a fractal wave function with filamentary structure likes a net\nover the whole volume, as suggested originally by Aoki [29]. Observations of\nthe scaling properties of different characteristics of the eigenstates show that\nthe wave functions cannot be adequately treated as a simple fractal. Rather,\nthe more general concept of multifractality has to be employed, yielding a\nset of generalized dimensions.\nThe multifractal fluctuations of eigenfunctions can be characterized by a\nset of inverse participation rations\nPp =\n\nZ\n\ndd r|\u03c8(r)|2p\n\n(9)\n\nwith an anomalous scaling with respect to system size L\nPp \u223c L\u2212\u03c4p ,\n\n\u03c4p = Dp (p \u2212 1)\n6\n\n(10)\n\n\fThe scaling (10) characterized by an infinite set of generalized dimensions Dp\nimplies that the critical eigenfunction represents a multifractal distribution.\nDuring the past decade, multifractality of critical eigenfunctions at the Anderson transition has been a subject of intensive numerical studies see Refs.\n[19]-[27] and references therein. In recent paper [27] the authors explore the\nfluctuations at criticality for the power-law random banded matrix (PRBM)\nensemble. The model is defined as the ensemble of random Hermitian NxN\nmatrices. The matrix elements Hij are independently distributed Gaussian\nvariables with zero mean hHij i = 0 and the variance\nh|Hij |2 i = a2 (|i \u2212 j)|),\nwhere a(r) is given by\na2 (r) =\n\n1\n1 + (r/b)2\u03b1\n\n(11)\n\n(12)\n\nAt \u03b1 = 1 the model undergoes an Anderson transition from the localized\n(\u03b1 > 1) to the delocalized (\u03b1 < 1) phase. At \u03b1 = 1 the PRBM model\nwas found to be critical for arbitrary value of b; it shows all the key features of the Anderson critical point, including multifractality of eigenfunctions. In a straightforward interpretation, the PRBM model describes an\none-dimensional sample with random long-range hopping, the hopping amplitude decaying as 1/r \u03b1 with the length of the hop. Such a random matrix\nensemble arises in various contexts in the theory of quantum chaos [33],[34]\nand disordered systems [35],[36],[37]. In the paper [27] the authors studied\nthe periodic (critical) generalization of (12)\na\u22122 (r) = 1 +\n\n1 sin2 (\u03c0r/N)\nb2 (\u03c0/N)2\n\n(13)\n\nIndeed, for N \u226b r Eq. (13) reduces to Eq. (12) at the critical case. The\ngeneralization (13) allows diminish finite-size effects (an analog of periodic\nboundary conditions). At b = 1 a limiting distribution can be reached most\neasily and, therefore, the finite-size effects are minimal [27]. This value of\nparameter b corresponds to crossover from weak (b \u226b 1) to strong (1 \u226b b)\nmultifractality. Below we will compare results of the numerical simulations\nperformed for b = 1 with the large-scale CMB data.\n\n7\n\n\fTemperature (T ) dissipation rate of the photon (CMB) gas can be characterized by a \"gradient\" space measure ([38], p. 381):\n\u03c7r =\n\nvr (\u25bdT )\n\nR\n\n2\n\ndv\n\nvr\n\n(14)\n\nwhere vr is a subvolume with space-scale r. Scaling law of this measure\nmoments,\nh\u03c7pr i\n\u223c r \u2212\u03bcp\n(15)\np\nh\u03c7r i\n(where h...i means an average) is an important characteristic of the dissipation rate [38],[39]. The exponents \u03bcp can be related to correspondent\ngeneralized dimensions by equation [39]:\n\u03bcp = (d \u2212 Dp )(p \u2212 1)\n\n(16)\n\nThe COBE satellite was launched on 1989 into 900 km altitude sunsynchronous orbit. The Differential Microwave Radiometers (DMR) operated for four years of the COBE mission and mapped the full sky. The\ninstrument consists of six differential microwave radiometers, two nearly independent channels that operate at each of three frequencies: 31.5, 53 and\n90 GHz. Each differential radiometer measures the difference in power received from two directions in the sky separated by 600 , using a pair of horn\nantennas. Each antenna has a 70 beam. In this investigation we use a DMR\ndata map of the cosmic microwave radiation temperature. The COBE-DMR\nteam made an effort to remove the most of the Galactic microwave emission\n(i.e. thermal emission of cosmic dust, free-free emission and synchrotron\nemission) from the map using so-called \"combination technique\" in which a\nlinear combination of the DMR maps is used to cancel the Galactic emission. This was made in order to extract the cosmic microwave background\nradiation.\nTo organize the DMR data in the temperature maps the sky was divided\ninto 6144 equal area pixels. These are formed by constructing a cube with\neach face divided into 32 x 32 = 1024 squares, projected onto a celestial\nsphere in elliptic coordinates. The projection is adjusted to form equal area\npixels having a solid angle of 4\u03c0/6144 sr or 6.7 square degrees. Because the\n70 beamwidth of the sky horn is greater than separation between pixels (2.60\naverage), this binning oversamples the sky.\n8\n\n\fUsing the CMB pixel map, we will calculate the CMB temperature gradient measure using summation over pixel sets instead of integration over\nsubvolumes vr . So that multiscaling (15) (if exists) will be written as\nh\u03c7ps i\n\u223c s\u2212\u03bcp\nh\u03c7s ip\n\n(17)\n\nwhere metric scale r (from (15)) is replaced by number of the pixels, s, characterizing size of the summation set. The \u03c7s is a one-dimensional surrogate\nof the real dissipation rate \u03c7r . It is believed that the surrogates can reproduce quantitative multiscaling properties of the dissipation rate [39]. Since in\nour case h\u03c7s i is independent on s, we will calculate the exponents \u03bcp directly\nfrom scaling of h\u03c7ps i.\nFigure 1 shows scaling of the CMB temperature dissipation rate moments\ncalculated for the DMR map. The straight lines (the best fit) are drawn\nto indicate the scaling in the log-log scales.\nFigure 2 shows the generalized dimensions Dp extracted from figure 1\n(circles) using Eq. (16). Crosses in this figure correspond to the generalized dimensions calculated for the above described PRBM model [27] of the\nAnderson localization.\nh\u03c7ps i\n\n4\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe Anderson localization is an unique linear phenomenon which exhibits\nprofound multifractality. This allows explain the observed multifractality\nof the CMB dissipation in the frames of standard (linear) approach to the\nCMB, which seems to be the most compatible with the small magnitude of\nthe CMB fluctuations. Generation of the cosmic electromagnetic fields in the\nelectroweak or QCD phase transitions occurring in the particle physics scales\nneeds in a non-linear (turbulent) mechanism for reasonable space scale expansion of the fields [1]-[12]. Then the Anderson localization of the large-scale\nelectromagnetic fields can be considered as an effective linear mechanism of\nthe final CMB fractalization. This is because the photon diffusion, which can\neffectively suppress the non-linear fluctuations just before the recombination\ntime, does not occur to the localized modes.\n\n9\n\n\fThe author is grateful to C.H.
