Introduction\nThe problem of convexifying a polygon (that is, continuously transforming it,\nwhile maintaining simplicity) is a classical, well-studied problem in computational\ngeometry. Different restrictions on the transformations allowed give rise to several\nversions of this problem. In the most famous variant, the lengths of the edges are\nto be maintained; this is the celebrated Carpenter's Rule Theorem (see [3, 6]).\nDevadoss [4] proposed another variant: (1) can every polygon be convexified\nwithout losing internal visibility between any pair of vertices? (equivalently: does\nevery polygon admit a visibility-preserving convexification?) Devadoss [5] also\nraised a stronger version of this question: (2) does there exist a visibility-preserving\nconvexification in which at most one vertex is moved at a time (that is, by singlevertex moves)? Partial answers to (1) and (2) were given in [2] and [5].\nOur main result is the following.\nTheorem 1. An affirmative answer to (1) implies an affirmative answer to (2).\nThat is: if every polygon has a visibility-preserving convexification, then every polygon has a visibility-preserving convexification using only single-vertex moves.\nSince (1) has been recently settled in the afirmative by Aichholzer et al. [1], we\nhave the following.\nCorollary 2. Every polygon has a visibility-preserving convexification using only\nsingle-vertex moves.\n\u0003\nIn Section 2 we formalize the relevant notions at play (such as visibility-preserving\ntransformations and single-vertex moves). The proof of Theorem 1 is in Section 3.\nDate: October 15, 2018.\n2010 Mathematics Subject Classification. 52A10, 52B55, 52C25, 68R01, 68U05.\nKey words and phrases.

Visibility, transformations, and single-vertex moves\nA polygon consists of a finite set {p1 , p2 , . . . , pn } of points (the vertices), plus the\nstraight segments (the edges) joining pi to pi+1 for i = 1, 2, . . . , n (indices are read\nmodulo n). Throughout this work we implicitly assume that all polygons under\nconsideration are simple: edges only intersect in a common endpoint. Two points\nin P are internally visible (for brevity, visible) in P if the open segment joining\nthem is contained in the interior of P . We also say that the points are P -visible. If\np, q are P -visible vertices, then {p, q} is a P -visible pair.\nTo speak meaningfully about the continuity of the transformations under consideration, first we must agree on the underlying metric. Let kp \u2212 qk denote the\nusual Euclidean distance between points p and q. Let P, Q be polygons, and let\np1 , p2 , . . . , pn and q1 , q2 , . . . , qn be their respective vertices (distance is only defined\nbetween polygons with the same number of vertices). The distance d(P, Q) between\nP and Q is min\u03c3 {maxi\u2208{1,2,...,n} {kpi \u2212 q\u03c3(i) k}}, where the minimum is taken over\nall bijections \u03c3 : {1, 2, . . . , n} \u2192 {1, 2, . . . , n}.\nLet Pn denote the collection of all polygons on n vertices. If P \u2208 Pn and \u03b4 > 0,\nwe let N\u03b4 (P ) denote the set of polygons Q \u2208 Pn such that d(P, Q) < \u03b4.\nThe polygonal transformations under consideration are obtained by moving the\nvertices of the polygon; their incident edges get dragged along. Thus, a transformation on a polygon P gets induced by defining, for each vertex p of P , a\n(time-parameterized) mapping that follows the movement of p. The time domain\nis any closed interval [a, d], and the orbit of p is a continuous mapping t 7\u2192 pt such\nthat pa = p. Thus, for each t \u2208 [a, d] we obtain a polygon P t (where P a = P ), and\nthe transformation (which we denote P [a,d] ) is a continuous mapping from [a, d] to\nPn , transforming the initial polygon P a = P onto the final polygon P d . If P d is\nconvex, then the transformation is a convexification of P a = P . If only one orbit is\nnot the constant map, then the transformation is a single-vertex move.\nNow let P \u2208 Pn be a polygon with vertices p1 , p2 , . . . , pn . A transformation\nP [a,d] on P is visibility-preserving if for all i, j \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , n} and all a \u2264 s \u2264 t \u2264 d,\nif psi and psj are P s -visible, then pti and ptj are P t -visible. If in addition there exist\ni, j \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , n} such that pai is not P a -visible from paj , but pdi is P d -visible from\npdj , then the transformation is visibility-increasing.\nLet k \u2265 3. A k-tuple (q1 , q2 , . . . , qk ) of vertices of a polygon P is critical if there\nis a straight segment that contains q1 , q2 , . . . , qk , and does not contain any point\nin the exterior of P . A polygon is critical if it contains a critical k-tuple for some\nk \u2265 3. The proof of the following is a trivial exercise.\nObservation 3. If P is a critical polygon, then there is a visibility-increasing\nsingle-vertex move with initial polygon P .\n\u0003\nLet P be a polygon, and let \u03b4 > 0 be small enough so that for every Q \u2208 N\u03b4 (P ),\nthere is a unique natural bijection between the vertices of P and the vertices of Q.\nWe say that \u03b4 is a safe radius for P if for every Q \u2208 N\u03b4 (P ), a triple of vertices of\nQ is critical only if the corresponding triple in P is also critical. The proof of the\nfollowing is straightforward.\nObservation 4. Every polygon has a safe radius.\n\n\u0003\n\n\fVISIBILITY-PRESERVING CONVEXIFICATIONS USING SINGLE-VERTEX MOVES\n\n3\n\n3. Proof of Theorem 1\nLet P \u2208 Pn , and let p1 , p2 , . . . , pn be the vertices of P . With n fixed, we\nproceed by induction on the number of nonvisible pairs. Since adjacent vertices are\nnot visible to each other, it follows that the minimum number of nonvisible pairs\nis n. If there are exactly n nonvisible pairs, then P is convex, and there is nothing\nto prove. Thus we assume that P has m > n nonvisible pairs, and that the result\nholds for every polygon in Pn with fewer than m nonvisible pairs.\nBy assumption, there exists a visibility-preserving convexification P [a,d] of P .\nAn elementary real analysis argument shows that there exists a smallest c \u2208 [a, d]\nsuch that P c is critical. We note that if c = a, then by Observation 3 we are done,\nusing the induction hypothesis. Thus we may assume that c > a.\nSince t 7\u2192 P t is continuous for all t \u2208 [a, c], Observation 4 and the compactness\nof [a, c] imply that there is a \u03b4 > 0 that is a safe radius for P t for every t \u2208 [a, c]. A\nsimilar elementary continuity argument using the compactness of [a, c] shows that\nthere exists a \u03c4 > 0 such that, for all s, t \u2208 [a, c] such that |s\u2212 t| < \u03c4 , d(P s , P t ) < \u03b4.\nEvidently, we may choose \u03c4 so that there is an integer L such that c \u2212 a = L\u03c4 .\nLet b := c \u2212 \u03c4 . We claim that for l = 0, 1, . . . , L \u2212 2 there is a sequence of\nvisibility-preserving single-vertex moves that takes P a+l\u03c4 to P a+(l+1)\u03c4 . Indeed,\na+(l+1)\u03c4\nfollowing\nit suffices to move (in any order), for i = 1, 2, . . . , n, pa+l\u03c4\nto pi\ni\n[a+l\u03c4,a+(l+1)\u03c4 ]\n. The choice of \u03c4 guarantees that each of these moves is\nthe orbit pi\nvisibility-preserving. We conclude that there is a sequence of visibility-preserving\nsingle-vertex moves that takes P a to P b .\nOnce we reach P b we proceed similarly towards P c , moving each vertex pbi towards pci , one at a time, for i = 1, 2, . . . , n. Consider the first critical polygon Q\nreached in this last stage (such a Q obviously exists, since P c itself is critical). Visibility losses (respectively, gains) may occur only when (respectively, immediately\nafter) reaching critical polygons. Thus, the choice of Q implies that before reaching\nQ, we cannot have lost visibility.\nSuppose first that in the moment we reach Q we lose visibility; we shall derive\na contradiction. In this case, the moving vertex (we recall we reach Q via a singlevertex move) must be part of a critical triple at Q, and two of these vertices must\nlose visibility at the moment of reaching Q. Immediately before reaching Q, the\ncorresponding three vertices clearly satisfy the following (which we call Property A):\neach two of them are either a visible pair or adjacent. Since before reaching Q there\nis no loss of visibility, the corresponding three vertices in P b (and hence all the way\nback to P a ) must also satisfy Property A. But the corresponding three vertices in\nP c cannot satisfy Property A: indeed, the choice of \u03b4 and \u03c4 , plus the fact that they\nare a critical triple in Q, imply that they must form a critical triple in P c , but no\ncritical triple satisfies Property A. This implies that there is a pair of vertices that\nare P b -visible but not P c -visible, contradicting that P [a,c] is visibility-preserving.\nSuppose finally that at the moment of reaching Q we do not lose visibility. In this\ncase, we have then reached Q from P b (and hence from P a as well) by a sequence\nof visibility-preserving single-vertex moves. Since Q is critical, then we are done by\nObservation 3 and the induction hypothesis.\n\u0003\n\n\fVISIBILITY-PRESERVING CONVEXIFICATIONS USING SINGLE-VERTEX MOVES\n\n4\n\nReferences\n[1] O.
