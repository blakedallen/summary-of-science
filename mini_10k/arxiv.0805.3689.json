One\nof the most promising candidates for this task is the compactification of heterotic\nstring theory on a Calabi-Yau manifold [1]. In particular, the so-called \"non-standard\nembedding\" of E8 \u00d7 E8 heterotic strings has been a very fruitful approach to string\nphenomenology [2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8].\nFor a number of reasons, the most successful models of this type to date are\nbased on non-simply connected Calabi-Yau threefolds. These manifolds admit discrete\nWilson lines which, together with a non-flat vector bundle, play an important role in\nbreaking the heterotic E8 gauge theory down to the standard model [9, 10, 11, 12, 13,\n14, 15, 16]. In addition, they project out many unwanted fields which would otherwise\ngive rise to exotic matter representations and/or additional replicas of standard model\nfields. In particular, one can use this mechanism to solve the doublet-triplet splitting\nproblem [17, 18]. Finally, the non-simply connected threefolds have many fewer moduli\nas compared to their simply connected covering spaces [19]. In recent work [20, 21,\n22, 23], three generation models with a variety of desirable features were introduced.\nThese are based on a certain quotients of a Schoen Calabi-Yau threefold, yielding a\nnon-simply connected Calabi-Yau manifold.\nThe ultimate goal is to compute all of the observable quantities of particle physics,\nin particular gauge and Yukawa couplings, from the microscopic physics of string\ntheory [24, 25, 26, 27]. There are many issues which must be addressed to achieve\nthis goal. Physical Yukawa couplings, for example, depend on both coefficients in the\nsuperpotential and the explicit form of the K\u00e4hler potential. In a very limited number\nof specific geometries [24, 28, 29, 30], the former can be computed using sophisticated\nmethods of algebraic geometry, topological string theory and the like. For the latter,\none is usually limited to the qualitative statement that a coefficient is \"expected to be\nof order one\". Improving our computational abilities and extending these calculations\nto non-standard embedding has been an outstanding problem [1].\nRecently [31, 32], a plan has been outlined to analyze these problems numerically,\nat least in the classical limit. The essential point is that, today, there are good enough\nalgorithms and fast enough computers to calculate Ricci-flat metrics and to solve the\nhermitian Yang-Mills equation for the gauge connection directly. Given this data, one\ncan then find the correctly normalized zero modes of fields, determine the coefficients\nin the superpotential and compute the explicit form of the K\u00e4hler potential. Some\nprogress in this direction was made in [31, 32, 33, 34, 35] and also [36, 37, 38]. Making\neffective use of symmetries [39, 40], one can significantly improve the computational\nprocedure to find Calabi-Yau metrics and further extend it to non-simply connected\nmanifolds. In this work, we take one step further in the numerical approach to string\ntheory compactification and present an explicit algorithm to numerically solve for the\neigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the scalar Laplace operator. We use as one of the\n2\n\n\finputs the Calabi-Yau metrics computed using the techniques developed in [40].\nWe start, in Section 3, by discussing the general idea of the method and list the\nkey steps of our algorithm. This algorithm is then applied to the simplest compact\nthreefold, the projective space P3 . This threefold is, of course, not a Calabi-Yau manifold. However, in has the advantage of being one of the few manifolds where the\nLaplace equation can be solved analytically. We compare the numerical results of\nthis computation with the analytical solution in order to verify that our implementation is correct and to understand the sources of numerical errors. We note that the\nmultiplicities of the approximate eigenvalues are determined by the dimensions of corresponding irreducible representations of the symmetry group of the projective space,\nas expected from the analytical solution. We conclude the section by investigating the\nasymptotic behavior of the numerical solution and comparing it with Weyl's formula.\nHaving gone through this illustrative example, we apply our numerical procedure\nto Calabi-Yau quintic threefolds in Section 4. The eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are\nexplicitly computed for both a quintic at a random point in moduli space as well as\nfor the Fermat quintic. We can again explain the multiplicities of eigenvalues on the\nFermat quintic as arising from its enhanced symmetry; here, however, being a finite\nisometry group. The asymptotics of the numerical solution is verified using Weyl's\nformula. Note that the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions are not known analytically\nin the Calabi-Yau case, so our numerical algorithm is essential for their calculation.\nRecently, Donaldson has proposed a different algorithm to solve for the spectrum1 of\nthe scalar Laplacian. At the end of the section, we use it to numerically compute\nthe eigenvalues and eigenfunctions on a random quintic and on the Fermat quintic\nand compare these to our results. In Section 5, we consider non-simply connected\nCalabi-Yau manifolds, namely Z5 \u00d7 Z5 quotients of certain quintic threefolds. The\neigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Laplacian are numerically computed using our\nalgorithm, exploiting the Hironaka decomposition discussed in our previous paper [40].\nIn this case, the multiplicities of the eigenvalues are determined by finite \"pseudosymmetries\" [41]. We work out the necessary representation theory and again find\nperfect agreement with the multiplicities predicted by our numerical computation of\nthe eigenvalues. We conclude this section by studying the moduli dependence of the\neigenvalues for a one-parameter families of quintic quotients.\nIn Section 6, we apply this machinery to the case of a certain Z3 \u00d7 Z3 quotient of\na Schoen threefold [42, 43]. This is the Calabi-Yau threefold underlying the heterotic\nstandard model constructed in [21, 22, 23]. The essential new feature is the existence\nof non-trivial K\u00e4hler moduli, not just the overall volume of the threefold as in all\nprevious sections. As an explicit example, we numerically compute the eigenvalues\nof the Laplacian at two different points in the K\u00e4hler moduli space, corresponding\nto distinct \"angular\" directions in the K\u00e4hler cone. The group representation theory\nassociated with the covering space and the quotient is discussed.\n1\n\nThe spectrum of an operator is the set of eigenvalues.\n\n3\n\n\fWe conclude in Section 7 by considering some physical applications of the eigenvalues of the scalar Laplacian on a Calabi-Yau threefold. In particular, we consider string\ncompactifications on these backgrounds and study the effect of the massive KaluzaKlein modes on the static gravitational potential in four-dimensions. We compute\nthis potential in the case of the Fermat quintic, and explicitly show how the potential\nchanges as the radial distance approaches, and passes through, the compactification\nscale. We then give a geometrical interpretation to the eigenvalue of the first excited\nstate in terms of the diameter of the Calabi-Yau manifold. Inverting this relationship\nallows us to calculate the \"shape\" of the Calabi-Yau threefold from the numerical\nknowledge of its first non-trivial eigenvalue.\nAdditional information is provided in three appendices. We explicitly determine\nthe first massive eigenvalue for the Laplacian P3 in Appendix A. Some technical\naspects of semidirect products, which are useful in understanding Section 4, are discussed in Appendix B. Finally, in Appendix C, we explain a modification of Donaldson's algorithm for the numerical computation of Calabi-Yau metrics on quotients,\nwhich is used Section 5.\n\n2\n\nSolving the Laplace Equation\n\nConsider any d-dimensional, real manifold X. We will only be interested in closed\nmanifolds; that is, compact and without boundary. Given a Riemannian metric2 g\u03bc\u03bd\non X, the Laplace-Beltrami operator \u2206 is defined as\n1\n\u221a\n\u2206 = \u2212 \u221a \u2202\u03bc (g \u03bc\u03bd g\u2202\u03bd ) = \u2212\u03b4 d = \u2212 \u2217 d\u2217 d ,\ng\n\n(1)\n\nwhere g = det g\u03bc\u03bd . Since this acts on functions, \u2206 is also called the scalar Laplace\noperator. We will always consider the functions to be complex-valued. Since \u2206\ncommutes with complex conjugation, the scalar Laplacian acting on real functions\nwould essentially be the same.\nAn important question is to determine the corresponding eigenvalues \u03bb and the\neigenfunctions \u03c6 defined by\n\u2206\u03c6 = \u03bb\u03c6.\n(2)\nAs is well-known, the Laplace operator is hermitian. Due to the last equality in\neq. (1), all eigenvalues are real and non-negative. The goal of this paper is to find the\neigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the scalar Laplace operator on specific manifolds X\nwith metrics g\u03bc\u03bd .\nSince X is compact, the eigenvalues of the Laplace operator will be discrete. Let\nus specify the n-th eigenvalue by \u03bbn . Symmetries of the underlying manifold will, in\ngeneral, cause \u03bbn to be degenerate; that is, to have multiple eigenfunctions. We denote\n2\n\nWe denote the real coordinate indices by \u03bc, \u03bd, . . . .\n\n4\n\n\fby \u03bcn the multiplicity at level n. Each eigenvalue depends on the total volume of the\nmanifold.

Henceforth, however, we restrict our attention to even dimensional manifolds that admit a complex structure preserved by the metric.

(5).\nIn general, very little known about the exact eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of\nthe scalar Laplace operator on a closed Riemannian manifold X, including those\nthat are complex manifolds with hermitian metrics. The universal exception are the\nzero modes, where the multiplicity has a cohomological interpretation. Specifically,\nthe solutions to \u2206\u03c6 = 0 are precisely the locally constant functions and, hence, the\nmultiplicity of the zero eigenvalue is\n\u0001\n(12)\n\u03bc0 (X) = h0 X, C = \u03c00 (X) ,\n\nthe number of connected components of X. Furthermore, on symmetric spaces G/H\none can completely determine the spectrum of the Laplace operator in terms of the\nrepresentation theory of the Lie groups G and H. Indeed, in the next section we\nwill discuss one such example in detail. However, in general, and certainly for proper\nCalabi-Yau threefolds, exact solutions of \u2206\u03c6 = \u03bb\u03c6 are unknown and one must employ\nnumerical methods to determine the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. The purpose\nof this paper is to present such a numerical method, and to use it to determine\nthe spectrum of \u2206 on physically relevant complex manifolds. Loosely speaking, the\nalgorithm is as follows.\nFirst, we specify the complex manifold X of interest as well as an explicit hermitian\nmetric. For K\u00e4hler manifolds, the Fubini-Study metric can always be constructed.\nHowever, this metric is never Ricci-flat. To calculate the Ricci-flat Calabi-Yau metric,\none can use the algorithm presented in [31, 33] and extended in [40]. This allows a\nnumerical computation of the Calabi-Yau metric to any desired accuracy. Giving the\nexplicit metric completely determines the Laplace operator \u2206. Having done that, we\nspecify a countably infinite set {fa } that spans the space of complex functions. One\ncan now calculate any matrix element \u2206ab = hfa |\u2206|fb i and coefficient hfa |fb i using\nthe scalar product specified in eq. (5) and evaluated using numerical integration over\nX. As mentioned above, the most convenient basis of functions {fa } will not be\northonormal. Clearly, calculating the infinite dimensional matrices \u2206ab and hfa |fb i,\n6\n\n\flet alone solving for the infinite number of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions, is not\npossible. Instead, we greatly simplify the problem by choosing a finite subset of\nslowly-varying functions as an approximate basis. For simplicity of notation, let us\ntake {fa |a = 1, . . . , k} to be our approximating basis. The k \u00d7 k matrices (\u2206ab )1\u2264a,b\u2264k\nand hfa |fb i1\u2264a,b\u2264k are then finite dimensional and one can numerically solve eq. (11)\nfor the approximate eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. It is important to note that\nthis procedure generically violates any underlying symmetries of the manifold and,\nhence, each eigenvalue will be non-degenerate. Finally, we successively improve the\naccuracy of the approximation in two ways: 1) for fixed k the numerical integration of\nthe matrix elements is improved by summing over more points and 2) we increase the\ndimension k of the truncated space of functions. In the limit where both the numerical\nintegration becomes exact and where k \u2192 \u221e, the approximate eigenvalues \u03bbn and\neigenfunctions \u03c6n converge to the exact eigenvalues \u03bb\u0302m and eigenfunctions \u03c6m,i with\nmultiplicity \u03bcm . Inspired by our work on Calabi-Yau threefolds, this algorithm to\ncompute the spectrum of the Laplacian was recently applied to elliptic curves in [44].\n\n3\n\nThe Spectrum of \u2206 on P3\n\nIn this section, we use our numerical method to compute the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of \u2206 on the complex projective threefold\n.\n\u000e\n\u0001\nP3 = S 7 U(1) = SU(4) S U(3) \u00d7 U(1)\n(13)\n\nwith a K\u00e4hler metric proportional to the Fubini-Study metric, rescaled so that the\ntotal volume is unity. As mentioned above, since this is a symmetric space of the form\nG/H, the equation \u2206\u03c6 = \u03bb\u03c6 can be solved analytically. The results were presented\nin [45]. Therefore, although P3 is not a phenomenologically realistic string vacuum,\nit is an instructive first example since we can check our numerical algorithm against\nthe exact eigenvalues and eigenfunctions. Note that, in this case, the metric is known\nanalytically and does not need to be determined numerically.\n\n3.1\n\nAnalytic Results\n\nLet us begin by reviewing the known analytic results [45]. First, recall the FubiniStudy metric is given by gi\uf6be\u0304FS = \u2202i \u2202 \u0304\uf6be\u0304 KFS with\nKFS (z, z\u0304) =\n\n\u0011\n1 \u0010 2\nln |z0 | + |z1 |2 + |z2 |2 + |z3 |2 .\n\u03c0\n\nWith respect to this metric the volume of P3 is\nZ\nZ\n\u0001 6\n3\nVolFS (P ) =\ndet gi\uf6be\u0304 d x =\nP3\n\nP3\n\n7\n\n3\n1\n\u03c9FS\n= ,\n3!\n6\n\n(14)\n\n(15)\n\n\fwhere \u03c9FS is the associated K\u00e4hler (1, 1)-form. However, as discussed above, we find\nit convenient to choose the metric so as to give P3 unit volume. It follows from eq. (14)\nand (15) that one must rescale the K\u00e4hler potential to be\n\u221a\n3\n\u0011\n\u221a\n6 \u0010 2\n3\n(16)\nln |z0 | + |z1 |2 + |z2 |2 + |z3 |2 .\nK(z, z\u0304) = 6KFS (z, z\u0304) =\n\u03c0\nThen\nVolK (P3 ) = 1 ,\n(17)\nas desired.\nThe complete set of eigenvalues of \u2206 on P3 were found to be [45]\n4\u03c0\n\u03bb\u0302m = \u221a\nm(m + 3), m = 0, 1, 2, . . . ,\n(18)\n3\n6\nwhere we determine the numerical coefficient, corresponding to our volume normalization, in Appendix A. Furthermore, it was shown in [45] that the multiplicity of the\nm-th eigenvalue is\n\u00132 \u0012\n\u0012\n\u00132\nm+3\nm+2\n1\n(19)\n\u03bcm =\n\u2212\n= (m + 1)2 (m + 2)2 (2m + 3).\n12\nm\nm\u22121\n\nThis result for the multiplicity has a straightforward interpretation. As is evident from\nthe description of P3 in eq. (13), one can define an SU(4) action on our projective\nspace. Thus the eigenstates of the Laplace operator eq. (2) carry representations of\nSU(4). In general, any representation of SU(4) is characterized by a three dimensional\nweight lattice. In particular, for each irreducible representation there exists a highest\nweight\nw = m1 w1 + m2 w2 + m3 w3 ,\n(20)\nwhere w1 , w2 , and w3 are the fundamental weights and m1 , m2 , m3 \u2208 Z\u22650 . Starting\nwith the highest weight, one can generate all the states of the irreducible representation. It turns out that multiplicity eq. (19) is precisely the dimension of the irreducible\nrepresentation of SU(4) generated by the highest weight m(w1 + w3 ) = (m, 0, m).\nHence, the eigenspace associated with the m-th eigenvalue \u03bb\u0302m carries the irreducible\nrepresentation (m, 0, m) of SU(4) for each non-negative integer m. For convenience,\nwe list the low-lying eigenvalues and their\u000e corresponding multiplicities in Table 1.\nThe eigenfunctions of \u2206 on P3 = S 7 U(1) are the U(1)-invariant spherical harmonics on S 7 . In terms of homogeneous coordinates [z0 : z1 : z2 : z3 ] on P3 , the\neigenfunctions can be realized as finite linear combinations of functions of the form5\n\u0010\n\u0011\u0010\n\u0011\ndegree k\u03c6 monomial degree k\u03c6 monomial\n.\n(21)\n\u0010\n\u0011 k\u03c6\n|z0 |2 + |z1 |2 + |z2 |2 + |z3 |2\n5\n\nWe label the degree of the monomials here by k\u03c6 to distinguish it from the degree kh of polynomials in Donaldson's algorithm.\n\n8\n\n\fm\n\n\u03bcm\n\n0\n\n1\n\n\u03bb\u0302m\n0\n\n1\n\n15\n\n2\n\n84\n\n3\n\n300\n\n4\n\n825\n\n5\n\n1911\n\n6\n\n3920\n\n7\n\n7344\n\n16\u03c0\n\u221a\n3\n6\n40\u03c0\n\u221a\n3\n6\n72\u03c0\n\u221a\n3\n6\n112\u03c0\n\u221a\n3\n6\n160\u03c0\n\u221a\n3\n6\n216\u03c0\n\u221a\n3\n6\n280\u03c0\n\u221a\n3\n6\n\n\u2243 27.662\n\u2243 69.155\n\u2243 124.48\n\n\u2243 193.64\n\u2243 276.62\n\u2243 373.44\n\u2243 484.09\n\nTable 1: Eigenvalues of \u2206 on P3 . Each eigenvalue is listed with its multiplicity.\n\nOne can show this as follows. Let 4 and 4 be the fundamental representations of\nSU(4). Algebraically, one can show that\nSymk\u03c6 4 \u2297 Symk\u03c6 4 =\n\nMk\u03c6\n\nm=0\n\n(m, 0, m),\n\n(22)\n\nwhere (m, 0, m) are the irreducible representations of SU(4) defined above. Now note\nthat C[~z ]k\u03c6 , the complex linear space of degree-k\u03c6 homogeneous polynomials in z0 ,\nz1 , z2 , z3 , naturally carries the Symk\u03c6 4 reducible representation of SU(4). Similarly,\nC[~z\u0304]k\u03c6 carries the Symk\u03c6 4 representation. Defining\nFk\u03c6 =\n\nC[z0 , z1 , z2 , z3 ]k\u03c6 \u2297 C[z\u03040 , z\u03041 , z\u03042 , z\u03043 ]k\u03c6\n\u0010P\n\u0011 k\u03c6\n3\n2\n|z\n|\nj\nj=0\n\n(23)\n\nto be the space of functions spanned by the degree k\u03c6 monomials, then it follows from\neq. (22) that one must have the decomposition\nFk\u03c6 =\n\nk\u03c6\nM\n\nm=0\n\n\b\nspan \u03c6m,1 , . . . , \u03c6m,\u03bcm ,\n\n(24)\n\nwhere \u03bcm = dim(m, 0, m). Note the importance of the SU(4)-invariant denominator,\nwhich ensures that the whole fraction is of homogeneous degree zero, that is, a function\non P3 .\nTo illustrate this decomposition, first consider the trivial case where k\u03c6 = 0.\nNoting that \u03bc0 = 1, eq. (24) yields\n\u03c60,1 = 1,\n9\n\n(25)\n\n\fcorresponding to the trivial representation 1 of SU(4) and the lowest eigenvalue \u03bb0 =\n0. Now, let k\u03c6 = 1. In this case \u03bc0 = 1 and \u03bc1 = 15. It follows from eq. (24) that\nthere must exist a basis of F1 composed of the eigenfunctions of \u2206 in the 1 and 15\nirreducible representations of SU(4) respectively. This is indeed the case. We find\nthat one such basis choice is\n\u03c60,1 =\n\n|z0 |2 + |z1 |2 + |z2 |2 + |z3 |2\n= 1,\nP3\n2\nj=0 |zj |\n\ncorresponding to the lowest eigenvalue \u03bb0 = 0, and\n.P\n.P\n3\n3\n2\n2\n|z\n|\n\u03c6\n=\nz\nz\u0304\n\u03c61,1 = z0 z\u03041\n1,2\n1 0\nj=0 |zj |\nj=0 j\n.P\n.P\n3\n3\n2\n2\n\u03c61,4 = z2 z\u03040\n\u03c61,3 = z0 z\u03042\nj=0 |zj |\nj=0 |zj |\n.P\n.P\n3\n3\n2\n2\n\u03c61,5 = z0 z\u03043\n|z\n|\n\u03c6\n=\nz\nz\u0304\nj\n1,6\n3\n0\nj=0\nj=0 |zj |\n.P\n.P\n3\n3\n2\n2\n|z\n|\n\u03c6\n=\nz\nz\u0304\n\u03c61,7 = z1 z\u03042\n1,8\n2 1\nj=0 |zj |\nj=0 j\n.P\n.P\n3\n3\n2\n2\n\u03c61,9 = z1 z\u03043\n\u03c61,10 = z3 z\u03041\nj=0 |zj |\nj=0 |zj |\n.P\n.P\n3\n3\n2\n2\n\u03c61,11 = z2 z\u03043\n|z\n|\n\u03c6\n=\nz\nz\u0304\nj\n1,12\n3\n2\nj=0\nj=0 |zj |\n\u0010\n\u0011.

Note that we recover the\n6\nconstant eigenfunction for k\u03c6 = 0 through the cancellation of the numerator in eq. (26).\nThis pattern, where one recovers all the lower eigenmodes throughPthe factorization of\nthe numerator in each representation by an appropriate power of 3j=0 |zj |2 , continues\nfor arbitrary k\u03c6 . In other words, there is a sequence of inclusions\n\u0001\n{1} = F0 \u2282 F1 \u2282 F2 \u2282 * * * \u2282 C \u221e P3 , C .\n(28)\n\nNote that\n\ndim Fk\u03c6\n\n\u00132\n\u0012\nk\u03c6 + 3\n=\n,\nk\u03c6\n\n(29)\n\nwhich, together with eq. (22), explains the multiplicities given in eq. (19).\nAlthough a basis of Fk\u03c6 composed of eigenfunctions of \u2206 would be the most natural, there is no need to go through the exercise of decomposing the space into SU(4)-\n\n10\n\n\firreducible representations. For numerical calculations, it is simpler to use the equivalent basis\n\b\nFk\u03c6 = span fa a = 0, . . . , dim Fk\u03c6 \u2212 1\n(\n)\n, 3\n\u0010\n\u0011\u0010\n\u0011 \u0010X\n\u0011k\u03c6\n(30)\ndegree k\u03c6 monomial degree k\u03c6 monomial\n= span\n|zj |2\nj=0\n\nfor any finite value of k\u03c6 , even though these functions are generically not themselves\neigenfunctions of \u2206. In the limit where k\u03c6 \u2192 \u221e, the basis eq. (30) spans the complete\nspace of eigenfunctions.\n\n3.2\n\nNumerical Results\n\nFollowing the algorithm presented at the end of the Section 2, we now numerically\nsolve the eigenvalue problem for the scalar Laplace operator \u2206 on P3 . Unlike more\nphenomenologically interesting Calabi-Yau threefolds, where one must numerically\ncompute the K\u00e4hler metric using Donaldson's method [31, 33, 40], on P3 the K\u00e4hler\npotential is given by eq. (16) and, hence, the metric and \u2206 are known explicitly. This\neliminates the need for the first few steps of our algorithm, greatly simplifying the calculations in this section. Furthermore, the SU(4) action on the eigenfunctions allows\nus to identify a complete basis for the space of complex functions in terms of monomials of the form eq. (21). Since we know the exact eigenvalues and eigenfunctions\non P3 , this is an excellent venue for checking the numerical accuracy of the remaining\nsteps in our algorithm as well as the correctness of our implementation.\nGiven the metric, \u2206 and the complete basis of functions, the next step in our algorithm is to specify an approximating basis for the linear space of complex functions.\nThis is easily accomplished by restricting to\nn\no\n\u00012\nFk\u03c6 = span fa a = 0, . . . , k\u03c6k+3\n\u2212\n1\n,\n(31)\n\u03c6\n\nsee eq. (30), for any finite value of k\u03c6 . Next, we need to specify the volume measure\nin the integrals required to evaluate the matrix elements hfa |\u2206|fb i and hfa |fb i. Each\nmatrix element requires one integral over P3 , as in eq. (7). The volume form is\ncompletely determined by the metric to be\n1\n(32)\ndVolK = \u03c9 3 ,\n3!\nwhere \u03c9 is the K\u00e4hler (1, 1)-form given by the K\u00e4hler potential eq. (16). Although P3\nis simple enough to employ more elaborate techniques of integration, we will use the\nsame numerical integration algorithm as with Calabi-Yau threefolds later on. That\nis, we approximate the integral by summing over n\u03c6 random points,\nn\u03c6\nZ\n1 X\nf (pi ) \u2212\u2192 f dVol,\n(33)\nn\u03c6 i=1\n11\n\n\fwhere f is an arbitrary function on P3 . The integration measure dVol in eq. (33) is\ndetermined by the distribution of points. In other words, the random distribution of\npoints must be chosen carefully in order to approximate the integral with our desired\nvolume form dVolK . However, this can easily be done: simply pick the points in\nan SU(4)-uniform distribution. The corresponding integral measure is (up to overall\nscale) the unique SU(4)-invariant volume form, the Fubini-Study volume form. The\nnormalization is fixed by our convention that VolK (P3 ) = 1.\nThe process of numerically evaluating integrals by summing over a finite number\nn\u03c6 of points has one straightforward consequence. As discussed above, in the analytic\nsolution the m-th eigenvalue \u03bb\u0302m is degenerate with multiplicity \u03bcm given in eq. (19).\nThe reason for the degeneracy is that the m-th eigenspace carries the (m, 0, m) highest\nweight representation of SU(4). However, even though the n\u03c6 points have an SU(4)uniform distribution, the simple fact that they are finite explicitly breaks the SU(4)\nsymmetry. The consequence of this is that the degeneracy of each eigenvalue is completely broken. It follows that in the numerical calculation, instead of one eigenvalue\n\u03bb\u0302m with multiplicity \u03bcm , one will find \u03bcm non-degenerate eigenvalues \u03bbn . Only in the\nlimit that n\u03c6 \u2192 \u221e will these converge to a single degenerate eigenvalue as\n\u03bb0\n= \u03bb0 , . . . , \u03bb\u03bc0 \u22121\n\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bb15 = \u03bb\u03bc0 , . . . , \u03bb\u03bc0 +\u03bc1 \u22121\n\u03bb16 , . . . , \u03bb99 = \u03bb\u03bc0 +\u03bc1 , . . . , \u03bb\u03bc0 +\u03bc1 +\u03bc2 \u22121\n..\n.\n\n\u2192 \u03bb\u03020 = 0,\n\u221a\n\u2192 \u03bb\u03021 = 16\u03c0\n3 ,\n6\n40\u03c0\n\u2192 \u03bb\u03022 = \u221a3 6 ,\n\n(34)\n\nWe are now ready to numerically compute the finite basis approximation to the\nLaplace operator hfa |\u2206|fb i and the coefficient matrix hfa |fb i for any fixed values\nof k\u03c6 and n\u03c6 . The coefficients do not form the unit matrix, indicating that the\napproximating basis eq. (30) of Fk\u03c6 is not orthonormal. Even though one could\northonormalize the basis, this would be numerically unsound and it is easier to directly\nsolve the generalized eigenvalue problem eq. (11). We implemented this algorithm in\nC++. In practice, the most time-consuming part is the evaluation of the numerical\nintegrals for the matrix elements of the Laplace operator. We perform this step\nin parallel on a 10-node dual Opteron cluster, using MPI [46] for communication.\nFinally, we use LAPACK [47] to compute the eigenvalues and eigenvectors. Note\nthat the matrix eigenvectors are the coefficients hfa |\u03c6\u0303i and, hence, the corresponding\neigenfunction is\ndim Fk\u03c6 \u22121\nX\nfa hfa |\u03c6\u0303i.\n(35)\n\u03c6=\na=0\n\nWe present our results in two ways. First fix k\u03c6 , thus restricting the total number of\nnon-degenerate eigenvalues \u03bbn to dim Fk\u03c6 . These eigenvalues are then plotted against\nthe number of points n\u03c6 that we use to evaluate an integral.

Here we fix the space of functions by choosing degree\nk\u03c6 = 3, and evaluate the Laplace operator at a varying number of\npoints n\u03c6 .\n\nn\u03c6 , the eigenvalues are fairly spread out. However, as n\u03c6 is increased the eigenvalues\nbreak into distinct groups, each of which rapidly coalesces toward a unique value.\nOne can then compare the limiting value and multiplicity of each group against the\nexact analytic result. We find perfect agreement. To be concrete, let us present\nthe numerical results for the case k\u03c6 = 3. We plot these results in Figure 1. As\nn\u03c6 is increased from 10,000 to 1,000,000, the dim F3 = 400 eigenvalues \u03bbn cluster\ninto 4 distinct groups with multiplicity 1, 15, 84 and 300. These clusters approach\nthe theoretical values of the first four eigenvalues respectively, as expected. That\nis, the numerically calculated eigenvalues condense to the analytic results for the\neigenvalues and multiplicities listed in Table 1 on page 9. At any n\u03c6 , the eigenfunction\n\u03c6n associated with each \u03bbn is evaluated as a sum over the basis functions {fa |a =\n0, . . . , 399}.

Here we evaluate the spectrum of the Laplace operator as a function of k\u03c6 , while keeping the number of points fixed at\nn\u03c6 = 100,000. Note that k\u03c6 determines the dimension of the matrix\napproximation to the Laplace operator.\n\nThe second way to present our numerical results is to fix n\u03c6 and study the dependence of the eigenvalues on k\u03c6 . As was discussed in Subsection 3.1, since the\neigenfunctions of the Laplace operator are linear combinations of the elements of our\nbasis, the accuracy of \u03bbn should not depend on k\u03c6 . However, increasing k\u03c6 does add\nhigher-frequency functions to the approximating space of functions. More explicitly,\ngoing from k\u03c6 to k\u03c6+1 will add an extra \u03bck\u03c6+1 eigenvalues to the numerical spectrum, corresponding to the dimension of the (k\u03c6+1 , 0, k\u03c6+1) irreducible representation\nof SU(4). This is exactly the behavior that we observe in Figure 2.\n\n14\n\n\f3.3\n\nAsymptotic Behaviour\n\nIt is of interest to compare the asymptotic behaviour of the numerical solution to\nthe theoretical prediction of Weyl's formula, which determines the asymptotic growth\nof the spectrum of the scalar Laplace operator. Specifically, it asserts that on a\n2\nRiemannian manifold X of real dimension d, the eigenvalues grow as \u03bbn \u223c n d for\nlarge n. Here it is important to keep track of multiplicities by including the degenerate\neigenvalue multiple times in the sequence {\u03bbn }, as we do in our numerical calculations.\nThe precise statement of Weyl's formula is then that\n\u0001\nd\nd/2\n(4\u03c0) 2 \u0393 d2 + 1\n\u03bbn\nlim\n=\n.\n(36)\nn\u2192\u221e n\nVol(X)\nApplying this to P3 , which has d = 6 and the volume scaled to VolK (P3 ) = 1, we find\nthat\n\u03bb3\n(37)\nlim n = 384\u03c0 3 .\nn\u2192\u221e n\n3\n\nIn Figure 3 we choose k\u03c6 = 3 and plot \u03bbnn as a function of n for the numerical\nvalues of \u03bbn , as well as for the exact values listed in Table 1. The numerical results\nare presented for six different values of n\u03c6 . For each value of n\u03c6 , as well as for the\n3\nexact result, the \u03bbnn break into three groups, corresponding to the first three massive\nlevels with multiplicities 15, 84, and 300, respectively. Note that, as n\u03c6 gets larger,\nthe numerical results converge to the exact result. That is, each segment approaches\na curve of the form const.\n. Furthermore, as the number of eigenvalues increase, the\nn\nend-points of the curves asymptote toward the Weyl limit 384\u03c0 3 .\n\n4\n\nQuintic Calabi-Yau Threefolds\n\ne \u2282 P4 .

Unfortunately, the restriction of the Fubini-Study metric to the quintic\nis far from Ricci-flat. Recently, however, Donaldson [31] presented an algorithm for\nnumerically approximating Calabi-Yau metrics to any desired accuracy. To do this\nin the quintic context, one takes a suitable generalization, that is, one containing\nmany more free parameters, of the Fubini-Study metric. The parameters are then\nnumerically adjusted so as to approach the Calabi-Yau metric.\nExplicitly, Donaldson's algorithm is the following. Pick a basis for the quotient\n.\ne\nQ(z)\n(40)\nC [z0 , . . . , z4 ]k\nof the degree-k polynomials on P4 modulo the hypersurface equation.

One way to do this is the\n(k)\nfollowing.

Finally, to implement our volume normalization we will\nalways scale the balanced metric so that\n\u0001\ne k =1\nVolK Q,\n(50)\nat each value of k.\n\n4.1\n\nNon-Symmetric Quintic\n\nIn this subsection, we will pick random6 coefficients c(n0 ,n1 ,n2 ,n3 ,n4 ) for the 126 different\nquintic monomials in the 5 homogeneous coordinates. An explicit example, which we\nuse for the analysis in this section, is given by\ne\nQ(z)\n= (\u22120.319235 + 0.709687i)z05 + (\u22120.327948 + 0.811936i)z04 z1\n+ (0.242297 + 0.219818i)z04 z2 + * * * + (\u22120.265416 + 0.122292i)z45 . (51)\n6\n\nTo be precise, we pick uniformly distributed random numbers on the unit disk {z \u2208 C : |z| \u2264 1}.\n\n18\n\n\fWe refer to this as the \"random quintic\". Of course, any other random choice of\ncoefficients would lead to similar conclusions. The polynomial eq. (51) completely\nfixes the complex structure. Furthermore, the single K\u00e4hler modulus determines the\noverall volume, which we set to unity.\nUsing Donaldson's algorithm [31, 33, 40] which we outlined above, one can compute\nan approximation to the Calabi-Yau metric on the quintic defined by eq. (51). The\naccuracy of this approximation is determined by\n\u2022 The degree k \u2208 Z\u22650 of the homogeneous polynomials used in the ansatz eq. (42)\nfor the K\u00e4hler potential. To distinguish this degree from the one in the approximation to the Laplace operator, we denote them from now on by kh and k\u03c6 ,\nrespectively. In this section, we will use\nkh = 8.\nNote that the choice of degree kh determines the number of parameters\n\u0001\nh\u03b1\u03b2\u0304 \u2208 Mat N(kh ) \u00d7 N(kh ), C\n\n(52)\n\n(53)\n\nin the ansatz for the K\u00e4hler potential, eq. (42). This is why kh is essentially\nlimited by the available memory. We choose kh = 8 because it gives a good\napproximation to the Calabi-Yau metric, see below, without using a significant\namount of computer memory (\u2248 7 MiB).\n\n\u2022 The number of points used to numerically integrate within Donaldson's Toperator [33]. To distinguish this number from the number of points used to\nevaluate the Laplacian, we denote them by n\u03c6 and nh respectively. As argued\nin [40], to obtain a good approximation to the Ricci-flat metric one should choose\nnh \u226b N(kh )2 , where N(kh ) is the number of degree-kh homogeneous monomials\ne\nin the 5 homogeneous coordinates modulo the Q(z)\n= 0 constraint, see eq. (41).\nIn our computation, we will always take\nnh = 10 * N(kh )2 + 50,000.\n\n(54)\n\nThis rather arbitrary number is chosen for the following reasons. First, the\nleading term assures that nh \u226b N(kh )2 by an order of magnitude and, second,\nthe addition of 50,000 points guarantees that the integrals are well-approximated\neven for small values of kh . It follows from eq. (41) that for kh = 8 we will use\nnh = 2,166,000\npoints in evaluating the T-operator.\n\n19\n\n(55)\n\n\fUsing the Donaldson algorithm with kh and nh given by eqns. (52) and (55) respectively, one can now compute a good approximation to the Calabi-Yau metric in a\nreasonable amount of time7 . The expression for the metric itself is given as a sum\ne of degree kh = 8 with numerically generated complex coeffiover monomials on Q\ncients. It is not enlightening to present it here. However, it is useful to compute the\nerror measure defined in eq. (48) for this metric. We find that\n\u03c38 \u2248 5 \u00d7 10\u22122 ,\n\n(56)\n\u03c93\n\nmeaning that, on average, the approximate volume form 3!8 and the exact Calabi-Yau\nvolume form \u03a9 \u2227 \u03a9\u0304 agree to about 5%. Finally, having found an approximation to\nthe Ricci-flat metric, one can insert it into eq. (1) to determine the form of the scalar\nLaplacian.\nWe can now compute the spectrum of the scalar Laplace operator as discussed in\nthe previous section. First, one must specify a finite-dimensional approximation to\ne For any finite value of k\u03c6 , we choose\nthe space of complex-valued functions on Q.\n(\n)\ns\u03b1 s\u0304\u03b2\u0304\nFk\u03c6 = span\n\u03b1, \u03b2\u0304 = 0, . . . , N(k\u03c6 ) \u2212 1 ,\n(57)\n\u0001\nP4\n2 k\u03c6\n|z\n|\ni=0 i\nwhere {s\u03b1 |\u03b1 = 0, . . . , N(k\u03c6 ) \u2212 1} are a basis for the homogeneous polynomials modulo\nthe hypersurface constraint\n.\ne\nspan{s\u03b1 } = C [z0 , . . . , z4 ]k\u03c6\nQ(z)\n.\n(58)\n\nSuch a basis was already determined during the Donaldson algorithm for the metric,\nthe only difference being that now the degree is k\u03c6 instead of kh . The counting function\nN(k\u03c6 ) is given by eq. (41). Clearly,\ndim Fk\u03c6 = N(k\u03c6 )2 .\n\n(59)\n\nComputing the matrix elements of the Laplace operator requires another numerical\nintegration which is completely independent of the one in the T-operator. We denote\nthe number of points in the matrix element integration by n\u03c6 , as we did in the previous\nsection. We first present the resulting eigenvalue spectrum for fixed k\u03c6 = 3 plotted\nagainst an increasing number of points n\u03c6 . Our results are shown in Figure 4. From\neq. (41) we see that N(3) = 35 and, hence, there are 352 = 1,225 non-degenerate\neigenvalues \u03bb0 , . . . , \u03bb1,224 . Note that for smaller values of n\u03c6 the eigenvalues are\nfairly spread out, and that they remain so as n\u03c6 is increased. This reflects the fact\nthat for any Calabi-Yau manifold there is no continuous isometry, as there was for\nthe P3 . Furthermore, for the random quintic eq. (51) there is no finite isometry\n7\n\nThat is, within a few hours of \"wall\" time.\n\n20\n\n\f200\n\n\u03bb\n\n150\n\n100\n\n50\n\n0\n10,000\n\n30,000\n\n100,000\n\n300,000\n\nn\u03c6\nFigure 4: Eigenvalues of the scalar Laplace operator on the same \"random\nquintic\" defined in eq.

Therefore, one expects each eigenvalue to be non-degenerate, and our\nnumerical results are clearly consistent with this. At any n\u03c6 , the eigenfunctions \u03c6n\nare a linear combination of the 1,225 basis functions. We do not find it enlightening\nto list the numerical coefficients explicitly.\nNote that the accuracy of the numerical integration for the matrix elements8 is\nnot as crucial as in the T-operator, since we are primarily interested in the low lying\neigenvalues corresponding to slowly-varying eigenfunctions. This is nicely illustrated\nby Figure 4, where the eigenvalues rather quickly approach a constant value as we\nincrease n\u03c6 , even though n\u03c6 \u226a nh . For this reason, n\u03c6 = 200,000 gives a sufficiently\ngood approximation and we will use this value for the reminder of this subsection.\nA second way to present our numerical results is to fix n\u03c6 and study the dependence\nof the eigenvalues on k\u03c6 . This is presented in Figure 5. We first note that the number\nof eigenvalues indeed grows as N(k\u03c6 )2 , as it must. Second, as one expects, the smaller\neigenvalues do not change much as one increases k\u03c6 . The higher eigenvalues, however,\ndepend strongly on the truncation of the space of functions, since their eigenfunctions\nvary quickly.\nFinally, we plot \u03bb3n /n as a function of n in Figure 6. We see that this ratio does\napproach the theoretical value of 384\u03c0 3 as k\u03c6 and n increase. This confirms that\nthe volume normalization in eq. (50) is being correctly implemented and that our\nnumerical results are consistent with Weyl's formula eq. (36).\n\n4.2\n\nFermat Quintic\n\nWe repeat the analysis of the previous section for the Fermat quintic defined by\neF (z) = z 5 + z 5 + z 5 + z 5 + z 5 .\nQ\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n\n(60)\n\nAs before, the single K\u00e4hler modulus is chosen so that the volume of the Fermat\nquintic is unity. Now, however, we are at a different point in the complex structure\nmoduli space, eq. (60) instead of the random quintic eq. (51). Hence, we will perform\nthe numerical integrations now using points lying on a different hypersurface inside\neF using\nP4 . Except for using different points, we compute the Calabi-Yau metric on Q\nDonaldson's algorithm exactly as in the previous subsection.

According to Weyl's\nformula, the exact eigenvalues have to satisfy lim \u03bb3n /n = 384\u03c0 3 .\nn\u2192\u221e\n\n24\n\n500\n\n\f\u2022 We take the number of points used to numerically integrate Donaldson's Toperator to be\nnh = 10 * N(8)2 + 50,000 = 2,166,000\n(62)\nThis satisfies the condition that nh \u226b N(kh )2 , ensuring that the numerical\nintegration is sufficiently accurate.\n\nUsing kh and nh given by eqns. (61) and (62) respectively, one can compute an approximation to the Calabi-Yau metric using Donaldson's algorithm. The numerical\nexpression for the metric is tedious and will not be presented here. The error measure\neq. (48) for this kh = 8 balanced metric is\n\u03c38 \u2248 5 \u00d7 10\u22122 .\n\u03c93\n\n(63)\n\nHence, the approximate volume form 3!8 and the exact Calabi-Yau volume form \u03a9 \u2227 \u03a9\u0304\nagree to about 5%. The metric determines the scalar Laplacian, eq. (1).\nTo determine the matrix elements of the Laplace operator, one has to select an\neF , eq. (60). For any\napproximating basis for the linear space of complex functions on Q\nfinite k\u03c6 , we again choose the function space Fk\u03c6 as in eqns. (57) and (58). This basis\nwas already determined during the Donaldson algorithm for the metric. Computing\nthe matrix elements of the Laplace operator requires another numerical integration\nwhich is completely independent of the one in the T-operator. As we did previously,\nwe denote the number of points in the matrix element integration by n\u03c6 .\nWe first present the resulting eigenvalue spectrum for fixed k\u03c6 = 3 plotted against\nan increasing number of points n\u03c6 . Our results are shown in Figure 7. Note from\neq. (59) that the total number of eigenvalues is given by dim F3 = N(3)2 = 1,225.\nOne immediately notices a striking difference compared to the analogous graph for\nthe random quintic, Figure 4. Here, the eigenvalues converge towards degenerate\nlevels. For smaller values of n\u03c6 , the eigenvalues are fairly spread out. However, as\nn\u03c6 is increased the eigenvalues begin to condense into degenerate levels. Clearly, this\nmust be due to symmetries of the Fermat quintic. As mentioned above, no CalabiYau manifold has a continuous isometry. However, unlike the random quintic, the\nFermat quintic eq. (60) does possess a finite isometry group, which we will specify\neF should be degenerate\nbelow in detail. Therefore, the exact eigenvalues of \u2206 on Q\nwith multiplicities given by the irreducible representations of this finite group. As we\nwill see in Subsection 4.3, the numerically computed degeneracies of the eigenvalues\nexactly match the irreducible representations of a this finite isometry group. Again,\nwe do not find it enlightening to present the numerical results for the eigenfunctions.\nMoreover, as discussed previously, the accuracy of the matrix element integration for\nlow-lying eigenvalues need not be as great as for the T-operator. As is evident from\nFigure 7, a value of n\u03c6 = 500,000 is already highly accurate and we will use this value\nin the remainder of this subsection.\n\n25\n\n\f200\n\n\u03bb\n\n150\n\n\u03bc5\n\u03bc4\n\u03bc3\n\u03bc2\n\n100\n\n= 30\n= 60\n=4\n= 20\n\n50\n\u03bc1 = 20\n\n0\n\n\u03bc0 = 1\n10,000\n\n50,000\n\n100,000\n\n500,000\n\nn\u03c6\nFigure 7: Eigenvalues of the scalar Laplace operator on the Fermat quintic.\nThe metric is computed at degree kh = 8, using nh = 2,166,000\npoints.

This is presented in\nFigure 8. We first note that the number of eigenvalues grows as N(k\u03c6 )2 , as it must.\nSecond, as one expects, the smaller eigenvalues do not change much as one increases\nk\u03c6 , whereas the higher eigenvalues depend strongly on the truncation of the space of\nfunctions.

This ratio approaches\nthe theoretical value of 384\u03c0 3 as k\u03c6 and n increase. This confirms that the volume\nnormalization in eq. (50) is being correctly implemented and that our numerical results\nare consistent with Weyl's formula eq. (36).\n28\n\n\f4.3\n\nSymmetry Considerations\n\nRecall from Figure 7 that the eigenvalues of the scalar Laplace operator condense\nto a smaller number of degenerate levels as n\u03c6 \u2192 \u221e, that is, in the limit where\nthe numerical integration becomes exact. The same phenomenon is clearly visible\nat different values of k\u03c6 , see Figure 8. Of course the eigenvalues are never exactly\ndegenerate due to numerical errors, but counting the nearby eigenvalues allows one to\ndetermine the multiplicities. Averaging over the eigenvalues in each cluster yields an\napproximation to the associated degenerate eigenvalue. Using the data from Figure 8,\nwe list the low-lying degenerate eigenvalues and their multiplicities9 in Table 2.

The errors are the\nstandard deviation within the cluster of \u03bcn numerical eigenvalues.\n\ndiscussed previously, multiplicities in the spectrum of the Laplace-Beltrami operator\nresults must follow from some symmetry. In Section 3, we saw that the SU(4) symmetry of P3 leads to degenerate eigenspaces of the scalar Laplacian. However, a proper\nCalabi-Yau threefold never has continuous isometries, unlike projective space. Nevertheless, a suitable non-Abelian10 finite group action is possible and, in fact, explains\nthe observed multiplicities, as we now show.\nFirst, note that for each distinct eigenvalue the corresponding space of eigenfunctions must form a representation11 of the symmetry group. Clearly, the degeneracies\nof the eigenvalues observed in Figure 7 and Figure 8 must arise from an isometry of\neF . In fact, the Fermat quintic does have a large non-Abelian finite symmetry group.\nQ\nTo see this, note that the zero set of eq. (60) is invariant under\n\u2022 Multiplying a homogeneous coordinate by a fifth root of unity. However, not\nall (Z5 )5 phases act effectively because the projective coordinates are identified\n\n9\nInterestingly, the correct multiplicity \u03bc1 = 20 was derived by a completely different argument\nin [49].\n10\nAn Abelian symmetry group would only have one-dimensional representations and, hence, need\nnot lead to degenerate eigenvalues. Note that any finite group has a finite number of irreducible\nrepresentations and, therefore, one expects only a finite number of possible multiplicities for the\neigenvalues of the Laplace operator. This is in contrast to the aforementioned P3 case, where the\nmultiplicities grow without bound.\n11\nAn actual linear representation, not just a representation up to phases (projective representation).\n\n29\n\n\fd\n\n1 2 4\n\n5 6\n\n8 10 12 20 30\n\n40 60 80 120\n\n# of irreps\nin dim d\n\n4 4 4\n\n4 2\n\n4\n\n12 18\n\n4\n\n2\n\n8\n\n8\n\n4\n\n2\n\ne F ) = Z2 \u22c9 Aut(Q\neF )\nTable 3: Number of irreducible representations of Aut(Q\nin each complex dimension.\n\nunder the rescaling\n\u0002\n\u0003 \u0002\n\u0003\nz0 : z1 : z2 : z3 : z4 = \u03bbz0 : \u03bbz1 : \u03bbz2 : \u03bbz3 : \u03bbz4 .\n\u000e\nOnly (Z5 )5 Z5 \u2243 (Z5 )4 acts effectively.\n\n(64)\n\n\u2022 Any permutation of the 5 homogeneous coordinates.

Note that even though the Z2 acts as complex conjugation\neF ) acts linearly on the the basis of complex\non the base space, the whole Aut(Q\neF and, hence, on the eigenfunctions. There are 80 distinct irreducible\nfunctions on Q\nrepresentations occurring in 14 different dimensions, ranging from 1 to 120. We list\nthem in Table 3.\nWe conclude by noting that the multiplicities listed in Table 2 also occur in\nTable 3. That is, the eigenspaces of the degenerate eigenvalues of the scalar Laplacian\neF , computed using our numerical algorithm, indeed fall into irreducible repreon Q\n\u0001\n\u00014\nsentations of the finite symmetry group S5 \u00d7 Z2 \u22c9 Z5 , as they must. This gives\nus further confidence that our numerical computation of the Laplacian spectrum is\nreliable.\n\n4.4\n\nDonaldson's Method\n\nDonaldson [31] conjectured a method to compute the eigenvalues of the scalar Laplace\noperator that is completely independent of our approach. His calculation of the spectrum of the scalar Laplacian is very much tied into his algorithm for computing\n30\n\n\fbalanced (Calabi-Yau) metrics. In our algorithm, on the other hand side, any metric\ncould be used and no particular simplifications arise just because the metric happens\nto be balanced or Calabi-Yau. Because they are so different, it is quite interesting\nto compare both methods. We will now review his proposal, and then compare it\nwith our previous computation of the eigenvalues on the Fermat quintic as well as the\nrandom quintic.\nIn this alternative approach to calculating the spectrum of the Laplace-Beltrami\noperator, one first has to run through Donaldson's algorithm for the metric. In particular, one had to choose a degree k, fix a basis {s\u03b1 |\u03b1 = 0, . . . , N(k) \u2212 1}, and obtain\nthe balanced metric h\u03b1\u03b2\u0304 as the fixed point of Donaldson's T-operator. Let us write\ns\u03b1 s\u0304\u03b2\u0304\n\u03b3 \u03b4\u0304\n\u03b3 \u03b4\u0304 h s\u03b3 s\u0304\u03b4\u0304\n\ns\u03b1 , s\u03b2 ) = P\n\n(67)\n\nfor the integrand of the T-operator eq. (43).

Note that Qji is not hermitian13 and one should use\nthe Schur factorization14 to compute eigenvalues.\n5. Discard all \u039bn \u2264 0, these correspond to high eigenvalues of the Laplacian that\nare not approximated well at the chosen degree k. The eigenvalues of the scalar\nLaplace operator are\np\n(74)\n\u03bbn = \u22124\u03c0 3 N(k) ln \u039bn .\n\nWe note that, in this approach to the spectrum of the Laplace-Beltrami operator,\nthere is only one degree k that controls the accuracy of the eigenvalues of the scalar\nLaplacian and at the same time the accuracy of the Calabi-Yau metric. In fact, computing the integral eq. (68) at degree k is about as expensive as computing Donaldson's\nT-operator at degree 2k. In other words, a general limitation of this approach is that\none has to work with a relatively low precision metric.\nIn Figure 10 we compare the two approaches for computing the spectrum of the\nLaplace-Beltrami operator on the Fermat quintic. We compute the eigenvalues using\nDonaldson's method at degrees k = 1, 2, 3 and evaluate the necessary integral eq. (68)\nusing n = 10N(k)2 + 100,000 points. For comparison, we also plot the eigenvalues\nobtained by directly computing the matrix elements of the Laplacian which we always\ncompute at degree k\u03c6 = 3 using n\u03c6 = 500,000 points. To estimate the effect of\nthe metric on the eigenvalues, we run our algorithm first with the metric obtain at\ndegree kh = 3 and15 nh = 62250 (bad approximation to the Calabi-Yau metric, red\ndiagonal crosses) as well as with kh = 8 and nh = 2,166,000 (good approximation\nto the Calabi-Yau metric, blue upright crosses). We find that the eigenvalues do not\nstrongly depend on the details of the metric. Generally, Donaldson's method and the\ndirect computation yield very similar results. There is a slight disagreement for the\nsecond and third massive level, where the matrix element calculation points toward\n\u03bc2 = 20, \u03bc3 = 4 while Donaldson's method suggests the opposite order \u03bc3 = 4, \u03bc4 =\n20. We suspect this is to be a numerical error due to the finite degrees and it would\nbe interesting to go to higher degree in k, k\u03c6 , and kh .\nQji is, however, conjugate to a hermitian matrix and hence has real eigenvalues.\n14\nInstead of the dqds algorithm we use for computing eigenvalues of hermitian matrices.\n15\nThe number of points nh is always obtained from the heuristic eq.

First, the lowest eigenvalue \u03bb0 is no longer zero up to\nmachine precision, as it was in Table 2. This is so because the constant function\nis not part of the approximate space of functions at k\u03c6 = 10 and, therefore, the\nlowest eigenvalue \u03bb0 only approaches zero as k\u03c6 increases. The actual numerical\nvalue \u03bb0 \u2248 1.2 gives us an estimate of the error introduced by truncating the space\nof functions. Second, the low-lying eigenvalues clearly form degenerate levels. As\nusual, the numerical error caused by the truncation of the space of functions increases\nas we go to higher eigenvalues. However, the first 16 eigenvalues are sufficiently\nwell separated that we can conjecture the underlying multiplicities \u03bc. We list these\ndegeneracies together with the best approximation to the true eigenvalue \u03bb\u0302 in Table 4.\nClearly, the degeneracies in the spectrum strongly hint at an underlying symmetry.\nWe will discuss the associated isometry group in the following subsection.\n\n5.4\n\nGroup Theory and the Quotient Eigenmodes\n\nThe free Z5 \u00d7Z5 action eq.

The results are listed in Table 6. We find complete\nagreement with the spectrum found by directly computing the eigenvalues on QF\ngiven in Table 4. Naturally, this comparison is limited by the number of eigenvalues\neF . The agreement of the lower lying levels, however,\nwe were able to compute on Q\ngives us confidence that the values of \u03bb\u0302m and \u03bcm for m = 3, 4, 5, 6, . . . given in Table 4\nare also a good approximation to the exact results on the quotient.\n\n5.5\n\nVarying the Complex Structure\n\nTo numerically compute any metric-dependent quantity on a Calabi-Yau manifold, one\nhas to fix the complex structure and K\u00e4hler moduli to specific values. This was done,\nfor example, in Subsection 5.3, where the moduli were chosen so that the covering\nspace was the Fermat quintic with unit volume. In this section, we will extend our\ne\u03c8 defined by the\nresults to the one-parameter family of Z5 \u00d7 Z5 symmetric quintics Q\nvanishing of the polynomial\nX\nY\ne\u03c8 =\nQ\nzi5 \u2212 5\u03c8\nzi .\n(104)\ne\u03c8 is unity. The\nThe Kahler modulus will always be fixed so that the volume of Q\ncomplex structure parameter \u03c8 can, in principle, take on any complex value. However,\ne\u03c8 is\nfor simplicity, we will only consider \u03c8 \u2208 R in this subsection. Note that each Q\nindeed a quintic with the free Z5 \u00d7 Z5 symmetry in eq. (76).

The resulting \u03c8-dependent\nspectrum can be found in Figure 13. Note that this one-parameter family of Z5 \u00d7 Z5 symmetric quintics passes through two special points,\nQ\ne\u03c8=0 = Q\neF is exactly the Fermat quintic. We will\n\u03c8 = 0: Without the\nzi term, Q\ninvestigate the symmetry enhancement at this point in the next subsection.\n\n\u03c8 = 1: This is the so-called conifold point, where the quintic is singular.

However, the reason for this is straightforward. The\nlow-lying modes are slowly-varying functions and, in particular, are almost constant\nnear any point-like singularity. For example, the first massive eigenvalue is essentially\ndetermined by the diameter of the manifold, see Subsection 7.2, and does not depend\non local details of the metric.\n\n5.6\n\nBranching Rules\n\nLet us return to spectrum of the Laplace-Beltrami operator in Figure 13 and focus\non the neighbourhood of \u03c8 = 0. Clearly, Q\u03c8=0 = QF is the quotient of the Fermat\nquintic, while Q\u03c86=0 is a deformation of the Fermat quotient that breaks part of its\ndiscrete isometry group. In particular, note that for small non-zero values of \u03c8\n\u2022 The first massive level \u03bc1 (QF ) = 4 splits into two pairs of eigenvalues.\n\u2022 The second massive level \u03bc2 (QF ) = 2 remains two-fold degenerate.\nIn this subsection, we will attempt to understand this from the group-theoretical\nperspective.\nAs discussed in Subsection 5.4, the multiplicities of the eigenvalues on the quoe\u03c8 /(Z5 \u00d7 Z5 ) are really determined by the representation theory of the\ntient Q\u03c8 = Q\nsymmetry group of the covering space. We have to distinguish two cases.\n\n\u03c8 = 0: This is the case of the Fermat quintic, whose symmetries we already discussed\nin Subsection 4.3,\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\ne\u03c8=0 = Aut Q\neF = S5 \u00d7 Z2 \u22c9 Z5 4 .\nAut Q\n(108)\n\n\u0001\neF were presented in Table 5.\nThe irreducible representations of Aut Q\nQ\n\u03c8 6= 0: In this case, the invariance of the zi monomial gives one further constraint\non the (Z5 )4 phase rotations.

We list these in Table 8.\nFinally, we are really interested in the eigenvalues on the quotient Q\u03c8 , which means\nthat one must restrict to the Z5 \u00d7 Z5 -invariants of each representation. For the Fermat quintic, we listed the number and the dimension, dimdZ5 \u00d7Z5 , of these invariants\nin Table 5. We list the analogous information for the Z5 \u00d7 Z5 -invariants within the\ne\u03c86=0 ) in Table 7. This allows us to compute the\nirreducible representations of Aut(Q\nsplitting of the eigenvalues on the quotient Q\u03c8 . However, just knowing the multiplicities turns out to be not quite enough since same-dimensional but different irreducible\nrepresentations can branch in different ways. In particular, the first massive level\ne\u03c8=0 , which can branch in\non Q\u03c8=0 comes from a 60-dimensional representation of Q\ntwo ways according to Table 8. However, since we have seen in Figure 13 that the\neigenvalues do branch, this 60-dimensional representation must be of the type 602 .\nTo summarize, these group theoretical considerations are completely compatible\nwith the observed branching of the eigenvalues under the complex structure deformation by \u03c8.

First, we deform\nthe Fermat quintic to a generic Z5 \u00d7 Z5 invariant polynomial; that is, switch on all\ncoefficients in eq. (76).

Consequently, we expect no degeneracies in\nthe spectrum of the Laplace-Beltrami operator.

In addition to the h2,1 (X) = 3 complex structure\nmoduli of X, there are also h1,1 (X) = 3 K\u00e4hler moduli. The K\u00e4hler class on the algebraic variety X is determined by a line bundle L whose first Chern class is represented\nby the K\u00e4hler class,\nc1 (L) = [\u03c9X ] \u2208 H 1,1(X, Z) = H 1,1 (X, C) \u2229 H 2 (X, Z).\n\n(118)\n\nPulling back to the covering space with the quotient map q, the K\u00e4hler class is equivalently encoded by an equivariant20 line bundle\n\u0001\nq \u2217 L = OXe (a1 , b, a2 ),\n(119)\n\nwhich is determined by some a1 , b, a2 \u2208 Z>0 .

This is all the data needed to apply Donaldson's algorithm and compute the approximate Calabi-Yau metric. Note that, since we always\nnormalize the volume to unity, the exact Calabi-Yau metric only depends on the ray\nQkh but not on the \"radial\" distance gcd(a1 , b, a2 ). However, the number of sections\nN(kh ) and, therefore, the number of parameters in the matrix h\u03b1\u03b2 , does depend on\nkh explicitly. Going from kh to 2kh , 3kh , . . . increases the number of parameters\nand subsequently improves the accuracy of the Calabi-Yau metric computed through\nDonaldson's algorithm.\n\n6.1\n\nThe Spectrum of the Laplacian on X\n\nHaving determined the metric, we now turn towards the spectrum of the LaplaceBeltrami operator. We do this again by computing the matrix elements of the\nLaplacian on the covering in an approximate basis of Z3 \u00d7 Z3 -invariant functions,\ncompletely analogous to Subsection 5.1.

The non-trivial K\u00e4hler moduli are the \"angular\"\ndirections in the K\u00e4hler cone, and we consider the two different rays Q * (2, 1, 1) and\nQ * (2, 2, 1). As expected, the actual eigenvalues do depend on the K\u00e4hler moduli, as\nis evident from Figure 15.\nFurthermore, note that there appear to be no multiplicities in the spectrum.

Since Y is compact, there is a scale\nassociated with it. Let us agree on a unit of length L such that Vol(Y ) = 1 * L6 . The\ngravitational interactions in this world are complicated, but have two easy limiting\ncases. First, if the separation r of two probe masses M1 and M2 is large, then the\ngravitational potential between them is given by Newton's law\nV (r \u226b L) = \u2212G4\n\nM1 M2\n.\nr\n\n(129)\n\nIn the other extreme, when r is very small, the potential becomes the Green-SchwarzWitten law\nM1 M2\n.\n(130)\nV (r \u226a L) = \u2212G10\nr7\nBy dimensional analysis\nG10\n(131)\nG4 \u223c 6 ,\nL\nwith a constant of proportionality independent of Y to be determined below. Inbetween these two extremal limits for the separation r, the gravitational potential is\na complicated interpolation between eq. (129) and eq. (130).\nThere are two alternative ways of describing fields on R3,1 \u00d7 Y . One can either\ndirectly use 10-dimensional field theory, or work with an infinite tower of massive\nKaluza-Klein fields depending on R3,1 only. Both methods are equivalent, but for the\npurposes of this paper we only consider the Kaluza-Klein compactification [51, 52, 53].\n(10D)\nIn this approach, the single 10-dimensional massless graviton gAB , A, B = 0, . . . , 9\nis decomposed into 4-dimensional gravitons, vectors, and scalars. For simplicity, let\nus only consider 4-dimensional gravity, that is, 4-d fields with symmetrized indices\na, b = 0, . . . , 3.

The most useful such basis consists of the\nsolutions to the equations of motion on Y , that is, the eigenfunctions of the scalar\nLaplace operator\n\u2206Y \u03c6n (y1 , . . . , y6 ) = \u03bbn \u03c6n (y1 , . . . , y6 ),\n\n\u03bbn \u2264 \u03bbn+1 .\n\n(133)\n\nThe corresponding 4-dimensional Lagrangian contains the infinite tower of fields\n(4D),n\ngab\nof mass\np\nn = 0, . . . , \u221e.\n(134)\nmn = \u03bbn ,\nAs discussed previously, there is a unique zero mode \u03bb0 = 0 leading to a single massless\ngraviton in 4 dimensions. The gravitational potential is then the sum of the potential\ndue to the massless graviton plus the Yukawa-interaction of the massive modes,\n!\n\u221e\n\u221e\nX\nM1 M2 X \u2212mn r\nM1 M2\nV (r) = \u2212G4\n(135)\ne\n= \u2212G4\n1+\ne\u2212mn r .\nr n=0\nr\nn=1\nAt distance scales r \u226b m11 , only the massless graviton propagates. This expected\nbehaviour is clearly visible in the r \u226b m11 limit of eq. (135), and one immediately\nrecovers eq. (129). At distance scales r \u226a m11 , on the other hand, the massless graviton\nas well as the infinite tower of massive spin-2 fields propagate. The corresponding\nasymptotic behaviour of the gravitational potential is less obvious.

This explicitly depends\non the details of the internal Calabi-Yau threefold Y , and there is no way around\nsolving eq. (133). The eigenvalues \u03bbn and corresponding eigenfunctions \u03c6n depend\non the Calabi-Yau metric and can only be computed numerically.

As an example, let us compute\nthe gravitational potential V (r) derived from the numerical eigenvalues of the scalar\nLaplace operator on the Fermat quintic discussed in Subsection 4.2. The result is\nplotted in Figure 16.\n\n7.2\n\nSpectral Gap\n\nAs is evident from Figure 16, deviations from the pure 1r (green line) and r17 (red line)\npotentials occur for r in the region where these gravitational potentials have a similar\nmagnitude. In fact, these curves intersect at\nr\nM1 M2\n15\n15G4 L6 M1 M2\n6\nG4\n\u21d4 r0 =\n=\nL \u2248 0.627L.\n(138)\n7\n3\nr0\n8\u03c0\nr0\n8\u03c0 3\nNote that this point of intersection is independent of the Calabi-Yau manifold and its\ngeometry. As will become clear below, for Calabi-Yau threefolds which are relatively\n\"round\", such as the Fermat quintic, r0 is a good estimate for the point of substantial\ndeviation from the 1r potential. However, for geometries that are stretched or develop\na throat in at least one direction, this deviation point is best determined by another\nscale, in principle independent of the volume of the internal space. This other scale is\nthe mass m1 of the lightest Kaluza-Klein mode21 , see eq. (135). For such manifolds,\nthe spectral gap22 \u03bb1 and, hence, the mass m1 becomes smaller. Eventually, the\nmanifold may be sufficiently elongated that m11 \u226b r0 . In this case m11 becomes the\nbest estimate of the point of deviation from the 1r potential.\nOf course, both the volume and \u03bb1 = m21 are determined by the geometry of the\ninternal Calabi-Yau manifold. However, what geometric property really determines\n21\n\nThe leading order correction to the gravitational potential is often [54, 49] parametrized by the\nlowest Kaluza-Klein mass m1 and its multiplicity \u03bc1 as\nV (r) \u2248 \u2212G4\n\n\u0001\nM1 M2\n1 + \u03bc1 e\u2212m1 r .\nr\n\n(139)\n\nWhile this works well for symmetric spaces like spheres and tori with their large multiplicities and\nwidely-separated eigenvalues, there are two issues when dealing with more general manifolds:\n\u2022 The multiplicity is caused by symmetries, and tiny non-symmetric deformations can (and will)\nmake the eigenvalues non-degenerate (see Section 5).\n\u2022 The separation between the zero mode and the first massive mode is, in general, much larger\nthan the separation between the first and second mode. For example, on the non-symmetric\n\"random quintic\" Calabi-Yau threefold in Subsection 4.1,\nm0 = 0,\n\nm1 \u2248 5.95,\n\n22\n\nm2 \u2248 6.00.\n\n(140)\n\nThe first massive eigenvalue of the scalar Laplacian, \u03bb1 , is also called the spectral gap since it is\nthe gap between the unique zero mode \u03bb0 = 0 and the first massive mode.\n\n57\n\n\fthe spectral gap \u03bb1 ? In fact, this is determined by the \"diameter\" of the manifold. Recall that the diameter D is defined to be the largest separation of any two\npoints, as measured by the shortest geodesic between them. Then, on an arbitrary\nreal d-dimensional manifold with non-negative scalar curvature23 , the spectral gap is\nessentially determined by the diameter via [55, 56, 57]\np\n2d(d + 4)\n2d(d + 4)\n\u03c0\n\u03c02\n\u2264 \u03bb1 \u2264\n\u21d4\n\u2264 m1 \u2264\n.\n(141)\n2\n2\nD\nD\nD\nD\nClearly, in a compactification where all internal directions are essentially of equal size,\nthe diameter is of the order of 1 * L. However, as soon as there is even one elongated\ninternal direction or one long throat/spike develops, the diameter can be very large.\nHence, the spectral gap becomes very small and deviations from 1r gravity appear for\nrelatively large values of r \u223c m11 .\nThe definition of the diameter D is very impractical if one wants to explicitly\ncalculate it, since this would require global knowledge about the shortest geodesics.\nHowever, to get a rough estimate of D, one can reverse the inequalities eq. (141)\nand then use the numerically computed value for \u03bb1 . For example, on the Fermat\nquintic our numerical computation in Subsection 4.3 yielded \u03bb1 \u2248 41.1. Therefore,\nthe diameter must be in the range\np\n2 * 6(6 + 4)\n\u03c0\n\u221a\n0.490 \u2248 \u221a \u2264 D \u2264\n\u2248 1.71.\n(142)\n\u03bb1\n\u03bb1\nThus, computing the value of \u03bb1 numerically on a Calabi-Yau threefold for specific\nvalues of its moduli gives us direct information about the \"shape\" of the manifold;\ninformation that would be hard to obtain by direct calculation of the diameter D.\nFor example, it follows from eq. (142) that the Fermat quintic is relatively \"round\".\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe are grateful to Evelyn Thomson for letting us use her 10 node dual-core Opteron\ncluster.

One can think of h as a block-diagonal matrix with blocks\nlabelled by the characters \u03c7.

Only now the basis\nalgorithm on the covering space Q\nof sections is such that the impact of the Z5 \u00d7 Z5 symmetry is clearly visible: h is\nblock-diagonal with blocks labelled by the characters \u03c7.\nAs usual, the balanced metrics are better and better approximations to the CalabiYau metric as one increases the degree kh . We find that this method of computing\nthe Calabi-Yau metric on the quotient Q is the most effective.\n\nBibliography\n[1] P. Candelas, G. T. Horowitz, A. Strominger, and E.
