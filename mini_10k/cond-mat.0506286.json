Introduction\nA wide range of realizations of qubit designs have been proposed1-10 for solidstate quantum computing. Subject to inevitable interaction with the environment, a qubit\nsystem deviates from coherent evolution, developing entanglement with the\nenvironmental modes. The goal of quantum information processing is to manipulate a set\nof qubits keeping a relatively low degree of the resulting noise-induced error. A variety\nof techniques have been proposed to deal with this issue, including quantum error\ncorrection codes,11-15 decoherence-free subspaces,16-18 and dynamical decoupling.19,20 In\nparallel, approaches to quantifying deviations from coherent evolution have been\ndeveloped,21-45 providing tools for investigating the environmently induced noise in\nquantum computing architectures. In most cases, it is impossible to obtain the exact\nevolution for the reduced density matrix of the qubits with the environmental modes\ntraced over. Recent studies of decoherence have therefore focused on different simplified\nmodels and approximations that allow to quantify decoherence processes on various time\nscales28,29,32,39,42 in order to evaluate measures to decoherence to compare with the noise\nthreshold requirements of quantum error correction schemes.\nGenerally, quantum computing algorithms rely on the possibility to apply a\ncertain number of gates consecutively on a qubit register.46 The details of the interactions\nused for each gate are irrelevant to the actual computation as long as the final evolution\noperator of the gate has the desired form.46,47 However, in any practical realization in a\n\n\u20131\u2013\n\n\fphysical system of qubits (two-state quantum systems), a number of factors may affect\nthe actual choice of pulse shapes used for quantum gates.48\nMost theoretical studies of decoherence have been restricted to idling qubits,\nbecause time-independent interactions are easier to handle. Estimates of the noise level\nfor such systems have been assumed to give an indication of the behavior for more\ncomplicated gated-qubit situations. Attempts to handle time-dependent interactions were\nprimarily made49,50 for Markovian-type models,51-53 which are applicable for relatively\nlarge times for which the environmental modes can be viewed as a thermalized system.\nHowever, for fast quantum computing dynamics, at short to intermediate time scales,\ndifferent models are more appropriate.29\nIn this work we introduce two approaches to evaluation of decoherence for qubits\nsubject to fast time-dependent gate operations on time scales appropriate for quantum\ncomputing. The standard paradigm for quantum computation involves a succession of\nsingle- and two-qubit gates. The specific results reported in this work are for a single\nqubit interacting with environment. The developed formalism can be generalized to\nhandle several-qubit gates as well. However, the calculations will be prohibitively\ncomplicated. Instead, approaches relying on approximate additivity31,32,36 of noise\nmeasures could be more appropriate.\nThe Hamiltonian of the system is\n(1.1)\nH = H S (t ) + H B + H SB ,\nwhere\nH S (t ) = H i + H g (t ) .\n(1.2)\nHere H i is the Hamiltonian of an idling qubit, while H g (t ) represents time-dependent\ngate control. The Hamiltonian of the environment is given by H B , and H SB is its\ninteraction with the qubit. The environment is often modeled as a bath of non-interacting\nmodes,54-60 with Hamiltonians M k ,\n\nHB = \u2211 Mk .\n\n(1.3)\n\nk\n\nThe system-bath interaction term is usually modeled [60] as\nH SB = S \u2211 X k ,\n\n(1.4)\n\nk\n\nwhere S is a Hermitian operator in the system space, coupled to the bath operators X k .\nWe will focus on the bosonic bath,54-60\n(1.5)\nM k = \u03c9k ak\u2020 ak ,\n\nwhere we set = = 1 to simplify the notation. The standard choice of the linear coupling60\nis\n(1.6)\nX k = g k ak\u2020 + g k* ak .\nSystems candidate for quantum computing are usually well isolated from the\nenvironment, and it is often expected that the interaction term is small with respect to\nother energy scales of the problem.14,15,39,42,51-53 Therefore, many approaches to\nevaluating decoherence utilize various forms of perturbative approximation in powers of\ng k . Furthermore, approximation techniques appropriate for short times, t, with the time\n\nvariable itself defining \"small\" quantities once the fast dynamics has been factored out,\n\u20132\u2013\n\n\fhave also been developed29 and found many applications.61-63 These two types of\napproach-perturbative in time or in interaction-are the only presently available\ntreatments of decoherence at short times. Here we will analyze and compare both\napproaches, developing the technique to accommodate time-dependent external \"gate\"\ninteraction.\nQuantum computing involves a sequence of time intervals during which\noperations are performed on single qubits or on pairs of qubits.46 For practical reasons of\ntractability it is usually assumed26,39,40,42,60 that evaluation of the degree of decoherence\nfor a given time interval can be approximately carried out assuming that initially the qubit\nsystem is not entangled with the bath, i.e., the overall density matrix, \u03c1 (t ) , is factorized\nat t = 0 ,\n(1.7)\n\u03c1 (0) = \u03c1 S (0) \u03c1 B (0) .\n60\nFurthermore, it is usually assumed that initially the bath is in thermal equilibrium,\n\n\u03c1 B (0) = e\u2212 H B\n\nkT\n\n(\n\nTrB e \u2212 H B\n\nkT\n\n).\n\n(1.8)\n\nThe reduced density matrix, \u03c1 S (t ) = TrB [ \u03c1 (t ) ] , then gives the evolution of the qubit\nsystem at times t \u2265 0 .\nThe approach to evaluation of decoherence with the environment modeled as a\nclosed (except for the interaction with the qubit) system of noninteracting modes, is often\ncalled a \"short-time\" treatment of decoherence. It has been utilized29 as a reasonable\napproximation at low temperatures, at which most of the bath relaxation time scales are\nlarge as compared to fast qubit manipulations. At longer times, however, the bath mode\ninteractions with a larger surrounding, as well as the interaction between the bath modes\nthemselves, will result in the destruction of the bath's fragile entanglement with the qubit.\nThe latter behavior has been modeled51-53 by resetting the bath modes to the thermalized\nstate (1.8). This \"Markovian approach\" to decoherence provides a treatment appropriate\nfor larger times, when one assumes that the bath modes are thus reset to thermal state\nafter each infinitesimal time step. Specifically, it has been argued23,33,35 that for \"pure\"\ndecoherence, dominated by processes that do not involve energy exchange with the bath,\nthe crossover between the two regimes occurs on time scales of order 1 kT (= = / kT ) .\nHere we work in the \"short-time\" regime.\nIntroduction of the time-dependent gate-function interaction, H g (t ) , see (1.2),\nmakes the short-time techniques for evaluating decoherence developed in Ref. 29\ninapplicable. In this work we developed a short-time approximation formalism applicable\nfor time-dependent interactions. As in the time-independent short-time approach, our new\nformulation preserves unitarity of the qubit-bath evolution and reproduces exact results\nfor a solvable adiabatic-coupling model. We also present an alternative approach based\non a unitarity-preserving perturbative expansion in terms of the qubit-bath coupling\nstrength.\nIn Section 2, we derive our new short-time approximation scheme and discuss its\nlimits of validity. An explicit expression for the reduced density matrix is given. In\nSection 3, we set up the formalism for the second-order perturbative approximation\nscheme for calculating the evolution operator of the qubit-bath system utilizing the\nMagnus expansion,64,65 which allows us to avoid dealing with time-ordering. Expression\n\n\u20133\u2013\n\n\ffor the reduced density matrix of a qubit is obtained, and the appropriate traces over the\nbath modes required for its evaluation are calculated.\nIn Section 4, the developed approximations are applied to the adiabatic model.26\nIn this case our short-time scheme reproduces the exact solution while the perturbative\n3\n\napproach follows the exact result up to the expected, order g , corrections. Our main\nresult is presented in Section 5, in which we evaluate decoherence of a qubit controlled\nby an external rotating wave.66,67 The model of rotating wave control provides a relatively\nsimple, though quite general example of dealing with decoherence in the presence of a\ntime-dependent gate function. Nonlinear dependence of decoherence properties on the\nrotating wave amplitude is analyzed.\n\n2. Short-time approximation for time-dependent gate interactions\nThe recipe for constructing the reduced density matrix at short times has been\ndeveloped for \"idling\" qubit systems described by time-independent Hamiltonians.29 It is\nbased on an approximate factorization of the overall evolution operator which allows\ntracing over the bath variables. The effect of the bath is then lumped into complex weight\nfactors26,29 entering the expression for the reduced density matrix, which completely\ndescribe the short-time decoherence processes. In this section we develop a formulation\nof the short-time approximation appropriate for analyzing decoherence for the timedependent case.\nWe begin with the assumption that the evolution of the coherent system, with the\nHamiltonian H S (t ) , is known. Specifically, for a single-qubit (two-state) system one can\nobtain, even with a time-dependent Hamiltonian, either numerically or, in some cases,\nanalytically, accurate expressions68-72 for the evolution operator, U S (t ) . Generally, we\nwill assume that the solution of\n(2.1)\niU\u0005 S (t ) = H S (t )U S (t )\nis available. The overall density matrix for t > 0 can be obtained in terms of the evolution\noperator, UT (t ) ,\n\n\u03c1 (t ) = UT (t ) \u03c1 (0)UT\u2020 (t ) .\n\n(2.2)\n\nThe latter is the solution of\niU\u0005 T (t ) = [ H S (t ) + H B + H SB ]UT (t ) .\n\n(2.3)\n\nFor short times, we approximately factor the evolution operator UT (t ) into a product that\nallows to compute the trace over the bath modes of the expression (2.2), yielding the\nreduced density matrix. We propose the ansatz\n(2.4)\nUT (t ) = WS (t )V (t )WS (t ) ,\nwhere the unitary operator WS (t ) = U S (t ) was introduced. Square root of a unitary\noperator is generally not a uniquely defined object due to the possibility to include phases\nin multiplies of \u03c0 , in the diagonalised representation. This ambiguity, however, does not\naffect further derivations. Substituting (2.4) in (2.3) yields the equation for V (t ) ,\n\n\u20134\u2013\n\n\fiV\u0005 (t ) = ( H B + H SB ) V (t ) + WS\u2020 (t ) [ H SB , WS (t ) ]V (t ) + [iW\u0005S (t )WS\u2020 (t ), V (t )] . (2.5)\nWhen dealing with idling qubits, i.e., no external gate is applied, there are two\nphysical processes that contribute to decoherence.26,29,51,52 One of them involves qubitbath energy exchange and leads to redistribution of the probabilities for the system to be\nin its various energy states, as well as to decoherence. For large times, such \"resonant\"\nrelaxation, when described within an appropriately formulated Markovian approximation\nfor the bath modes, yields a fully diagonal, in the energy basis, thermalized reduced\ndensity matrix. The other process, often called \"pure decoherence,\" does not involve\ntransfer of energy but results in phase noise that disrupts coherent evolution of the\nsystem. Since such nonresonant decoherence does not involve any specific time scales, it\ncan be dominant in disrupting quantum computation at short times. Furthermore, as\ndescribed in the Introduction, it has been argued23,33,35 that the time scale of the onset of\nMarkovian re-thermalization of the bath modes is given by = / kT . This time can be quite\nlarge for low-temperature systems utilized in quantum computing applications.\nTherefore, evaluation of short-time decoherence usually involves no Markovian\nassumption. In addition, an approximation is invoked of considering only pure\ndecoherence,26,29 or some other perturbative approach is used,39,42 in order to make\ncalculations tractable.\nThe former, pure-decoherence approximation29 for the time-independent case,\nH S (t ) = const , corresponds to the assumption that H S is approximately conserved,\n\n[ H S , H ] \u0011 0 , namely that the system operators\n\nH S and S approximately commute with\neach other. Therefore, one can omit the second and the third terms in (2.5). This\neffectively corresponds to a short-time approximation that retains terms of order t 2 and\npreserves the unitarity of the dynamics. We get\n\u2212i H + H t\nV (t ) = e ( B SB ) ,\n(2.6)\nwhich reproduces the short-time approximation of Ref. 29, derived by a different method.\nNote that even though expression (2.6) has terms with all the powers of time, only those\nup to t 2 inclusive, coincide with the exact solution, while the higher powers are kept to\npreserve the unitarity of the dynamics. In this section, we consider pure-decoherence type\napproximations, while Section 3 is devoted to a different, perturbative, approximation.\nWhen H S (t ) is time-dependent, generally the system's energy levels as well as its\nenergy exchange with the bath, and, therefore, separation of resonant vs. puredecoherence relaxation processes, are not well defined. Nevertheless, we will\ndemonstrate that in most situations omitting the last two terms in (2.5) still provides a\nunitarity-preserving approximation retaining terms of order t 2 , inclusive.\nLet us tentatively assume that the last two terms in (2.5) are small and write\n\u2212i H + H t\n(2.7)\nV (t ) = e ( B SB ) 1 + R(t ) .\n\n[\n\n]\n\nBy an iterative expansion of (2.5), one can show that the leading-order corrections to the\napproximate expression (2.6) have the form\nt\n\nt'\n\nt\n\ni\nR (t ) = [ \u222b dt '\u222b dt ''H g (t '') \u2212 \u222b dt 'H g (t ')t ', H SB ] + O(\u03b5 2 g t 3 ) ,\n2 0 0\n0\n\n\u20135\u2013\n\n(2.8)\n\n\fwhere \u03b5 is the magnitude of an average instantaneous energy gap of H S (t ) . Here g\nmeasures an average coupling strength in (1.6), under the assumption that S in (1.4) is\nchosen as dimensionless, of order 1, so that g has units of energy. The cubic correction\nO (\u03b5 2 g t 3 ) is present in the constant- H S case as well. The new commutator term that\n\ninvolves H g (t ) is also of order t 3 , provided H g (t ) is well behaved at t = 0 , as can be\nverified by expanding it in powers of time. Thus, our short-time approximation for the\noverall evolution operator is\n\u2212i H + H t\nUT (t ) = WS (t )e ( B SB ) WS (t ) ,\n(2.9)\nand the reduced density matrix of the system is given by\n\u03c1 S (t ) = TrB \uf8ee\uf8efWS (t )e\u2212i( H B + H SB )tWS (t ) \u03c1 (0)WS\u2020 (t )ei( H B + H SB )tWS\u2020 (t ) \uf8f9\uf8fa .\n(2.10)\n\uf8f0\n\uf8fb\nIn order to simplify this expression, we would like to factor out operators\ncontaining different bath modes. This will allow factorization of the trace to reduce it to\nsingle-mode traces. The bath mode operators enter in the exponents containing H SB , as\nwell as in the initial overall density matrix \u03c1 (0) ; see (1.4), (1.6) and (1.8). It proves\nconvenient to replace the only system operator entering in these factors, namely, S in the\nexponents, by c-numbers. This is done by introducing decomposition of the unit operator\nin terms of the eigenvectors of S , defined according to\n(2.11)\nS \u03bb =\u03bb \u03bb .\nOne can then derive the expression\n\u03c1 S (t ) = \u2211 e D\u03bb\u03bb ' (t ) WS (t ) \u03bb \u03bb WS (t ) \u03c1 S (0)WS\u2020 (t ) \u03bb ' \u03bb ' WS\u2020 (t ) , (2.12)\n\u03bb\u03bb '\n\nwith\n\ni H +\u03bb '\nX t\n\uf8ee \u2212i( H B +\u03bb \u2211 k X k )t\ne D\u03bb\u03bb ' (t ) = TrB \uf8efe\n\u03c1 B (0)e ( B \u2211 k k ) \uf8f9\uf8fa .\n(2.13)\n\uf8f0\n\uf8fb\nThe trace in (2.13) can be factored into the product of traces over single bath modes. For\na bath of bosonic modes, defined in (1.5) and (1.6), this calculation was already carried\nout in the literature,25,33,73 with the result\n\nD\u03bb\u03bb ' (t ) = \u2212 ( \u03bb \u2212 \u03bb ' )\n\n2\n\n\u2211\nk\n\n(\n\n\u2212 i \u03bb 2 \u2212 \u03bb '2\n\n2 gk\n\n2\n\n\u03c9k\n\n) \u2211k \u03c9k\ngk\n\nsin 2 (\u03c9k t 2) coth(\u03c9k 2kT )\n\n2\n\n(2.14)\n\n( sin \u03c9k t \u2212 \u03c9k t ) .\n\nWe will refer to the powers in exponents of this type, entering the eigenstate sum in\n(2.12), as \"decoherence functions,\" here D\u03bb\u03bb ' (t ) . Note that the real parts of the\ndecoherence functions are negative and, thus, correspond to decreasing magnitudes of the\noff-diagonal terms in the sum in (2.12). This effect drives the decoherence. The\nimaginary parts include phase distortion terms ( ~ sin \u03c9tk ), as well as terms linear in the\ntime variable. In the time independent case these linear terms represent system energy\ngap changes induced by the bath.\n\n\u20136\u2013\n\n\fDecoherence functions are usually evaluated in the continuum limit of infinitely\nmany bath modes, by converting the summation over the modes to summation, and\nultimately integration, over the mode frequencies. The \"efficiency\" of the modes of\n2\n\nfrequency \u03c9 in causing decoherence, is thus proportional not only to g (\u03c9 ) , but also to\nthe density of states \u03a5(\u03c9 ) . In model calculations,60 one usually assumes a power-law\nbehavior of the product \u03a5 g\n\n2\n\nat low frequencies, with a cut-off, \u03c9c , at large frequencies,\n\ne.g.,\n\n\u2211\nk\n\n\u221e\n\ng k f (\u03c9k ) \u2192 \u222b ( J \u03c9 n e\u2212\u03c9 \u03c9c ) f (\u03c9 ) d\u03c9 .\n2\n\n(2.15)\n\n0\n\n3. Perturbative expansion for time-dependent gate interactions\nPerturbative in\n\nexpansions have been considered for time-independent\n\ng\n\n39,42,51-53\n\ninteractions.\nMany of them, however, have been unable to keep the unitarily of\nevolution resulting in unphysical probabilities at short times.22 In this section, we\nintroduce an approximation scheme that relies on a perturbative expansion in terms of the\nsystem-to-bath coupling strength g , while preserving unitarity. An advantage of having\nthe alternative approximation accurate at short times is that by comparing the two\napproaches, one can gauge their limits of validity. A difficulty is that the resulting\nexpressions are much more cumbersome39,42 for analytical treatment than the short-time\napproach presented in the preceding section. Perturbative expansions in powers of g are\nusually justified for quantum computing,39,42,51-53 because only systems weakly coupled\nto the environment can achieve the desired threshold of 10\u22124 , down to 10\u22126 , error rate\nper cycle.14,15\nThe evolution of the overall density matrix \u03c1 (t ) in the interaction representation\nis given by\n(3.1)\ni \u03c1\u0005 I (t ) = [ S (t )\u2211 X k (t ), \u03c1 I (t )] ,\nk\n\nwhere\n\n\u03c1 I (t ) \u2261 U S\u2020 (t )eiH Bt \u03c1 (t )e\u2212iH BtU S (t ) ,\n\n(3.2)\n\nS (t ) \u2261 U S\u2020 (t ) SU S (t ) ,\n\n(3.3)\n\nand\n\nX k (t ) \u2261 eiH Bt X k e\u2212iH Bt .\nAn evolution operator can then be introduced via\niU\u0005 (t ) = S (t )\u2211 X k (t ) U (t ) ,\n\n(3.4)\n\n(3.5)\n\nk\n\nsuch that\n\n\u03c1 I (t ) = U (t ) \u03c1 (0)U \u2020 (t ) .\n\n(3.6)\n\u20137\u2013\n\n\fNote that U (t ) is directly related to UT (t ) as suggested by (3.2), (3.6) and (2.2).\nEquation (3.5) can be used to develop approximations perturbative in the system-bath\ninteraction. Furthermore, we will formulate such an approximation by utilizing a\nunitarity-preserving Magnus expansion.64\nWe note that it is always possible to write\nU (t ) = e \u2212i\u03a9(t ) ,\n(3.7)\nwhere \u03a9(t ) is Hermitian. Following the procedure of Ref. 65, one can expand \u03a9(t ) in\nthe power-series of the interaction strength, based on the fact that the right-hand side of\n(3.4) is linear in g ; see (1.4) and (1.6). We have\n\u221e\n\n\u03a9(t ) = \u2211 \u03a9 n (t ) ,\n\n(3.8)\n\nn =1\n\nwhere the leading terms are\nt\n\n\u03a91 (t ) = \u222b dt ' S (t ')\u2211 X k (t ') ,\n\n(3.9)\n\nk\n\n0\n\nand\nt\n\nt'\n\ni\n\u03a9 2 (t ) = \u2212 \u222b dt ' \u222b dt '' [ S (t ')\u2211 X k ' (t '), S (t '')\u2211 X k '' (t '')] .\n20\nk'\nk ''\n0\n\n(3.10)\n\nTruncating expansion (3.8) at n > 2 , we approximate evolution operator (3.7) to the\nsecond order in g .\nOur ultimate goal will be to evaluate the trace of the overall density matrix over\nthe bath modes,\n(3.11)\n\u03c1 S (t ) = U S (t )TrB \uf8eee\u2212iH BtU (t ) \u03c1 S (0) \u03c1 B (0)U \u2020 (t )eiH Bt \uf8f9 U S\u2020 (t ) .\n\uf8f0\n\uf8fb\nBy writing the expression (3.10) in terms of the bosonic creation (annihilation) operators,\nwe can identify terms that have no contribution to the trace in (3.11) within the\nsecond-order-in- g approximation. For example, g k g k 'ak\u2020 ak\u2020 ' and g k* '' g k* '''ak ''ak ''' ,\noriginating from (3.10), should be paired up with terms with the appropriately matching\nindices in order to produce a nonzero contribution to the trace. Therefore, all such terms\nonly contribute in order g\n\n4\n\nand can be omitted. One can also notice that terms\n\n2\n\ng k ak\u2020ak , when grouped with \u03c1 B (0) under the trace, yield quantities that are small for\n\nlow temperatures. The calculations of the trace of such combinations at low temperatures\nshow that the resulting expressions are smaller than the leading order- g\n\n2\n\ncontributions\n\nby factors of order ( kT \u03c9c ) , for the bath density of states (2.15). In our case kT << \u03c9c ,\nn\n\nn > 0 (in most systems of interest even n \u2265 1 ), and these terms are negligible.\nAfter some rearrangement of terms in (3.9) and (3.10), we can replace, inside the\ntrace only, the evolution operator (3.7) by the following expression, in which terms\nomitted in the exponent do not contribute to the trace in the leading orders of the\napproximations assumed,\n\n\u20138\u2013\n\n\fU (t ) \u2192 e\n\n\u2212i \u2211 Fk (t ) X k (t ) \u2212i \u2211 F\u0004k (t ) X\u0004 k (t ) \u2212i \u2211 Gk (t ) g k\nk\n\nk\n\nk\n\n2\n\n,\n\n(3.12)\n\nwhere\nt\n\nFk (t ) \u2261 \u222b dt ' S (t ') cos \u03c9k (t '\u2212 t ) ,\n\n(3.13)\n\nF\u0004k (t ) \u2261 \u222b dt ' S (t ') sin \u03c9k (t '\u2212 t ) ,\n\n(3.14)\n\nX\u0004 k (t ) = ig k ak\u2020 (t ) \u2212 ig k* ak (t ) ,\n\n(3.15)\n\n0\nt\n\n0\n\nGk (t ) \u2261 \u2212\n\nt\n\nt'\n\nt\n\nt'\n\ni\ndt ' dt ''[ S (t '), S (t '')]cos \u03c9k (t '\u2212 t '')\n2 \u222b0 \u222b0\n\n(3.16)\n\n1\n\u2212 \u222b dt ' \u222b dt ''{S (t '), S (t '')}sin \u03c9k (t '\u2212 t '') .\n20 0\nThe first two terms in the exponent of (3.12) came from (3.9); the third term originated\nfrom (3.10).\nAs in the short-time approximation case, the calculation of the trace over the bath\nmodes can be carried out if we replace certain system operators by c-numbers. This can\nonly be done if we first separate out the k-dependence of the system operators in (3.12).\nFor a single-qubit system, which will be assumed from now on, we expand all the system\noperators introduced in (3.13), (3.14), (3.16), in terms of the Pauli matrixes \u03c3 j , where\n\nj \u2208 { x, y, z} ,\nFk (t ) = \u2211 f kj (t )\u03c3 j , F\u0004k (t ) = \u2211 f\u0004kj (t )\u03c3 j , Gk (t ) \u2192 \u2211 \u03b3 kj (t )\u03c3 j .\nj\n\nj\n\n(3.17)\n\nj\n\nWhen expanding Fk (t ) and F\u0004k (t ) , we did not include the identity (unit) operator, thus\nassuming, without loss of generality, that Tr S = 0 . Indeed, the identity-operator term in\nS does not affect the system-bath coupling and can be eliminated by redefining the\nbosonic bath mode coordinates.26,57 The identity-operator term in Gk (t ) is irrelevant for\n2\n\nthe calculations of the density matrix to order g , as can be seen from (3.11) and (3.12).\nWe note that for several-qubit systems, one should use an appropriate set of basic\nmatrixes of higher dimension including identity. Terms containing different \u03c3 j in the\nexponent of (3.12) are next factorized by using the relation\n1\n\n\u220fe\n\ngA j\n\n=e\n\n\u2211 gA j + 2 g 2 \u2211 [ Ai , A j ]+O ( g 3 )\nj\n\ni< j\n\n,\n\nj\n\nwhere A j denote a set of operators, and g is a small parameter.

These indexes,\nwhile allowing the use of the vector dot-product notation, see below, should no be\nconfused with the Cartesian x, y, z used in superscripts of the expansion coefficients in\n(3.17) and in labeling the Pauli matrixes.

We point out that the use of the relation (3.18), with the operators A j\nproportional to the Pauli matrixes, makes the resulting expressions dependent on the\nchoice of the Cartesian axis in the spin space, though the difference is of order higher\n2\n\nthan g .\nThe reduced density matrix is now easy to construct, by substituting (3.20) into\n(3.11),\n\n\u03c1 S (t ) = \u2211 e\nx,x '\n\nDx , x ' (t )\n\nU S (t )M x \u03c1 S (0)M \u2020x'U S\u2020 (t ) .\n\n(3.23)\n\nHere the quantity\ne\n\nDx , x ' (t )\n\ni \u2211 ( x '\u22c5f\u0004k ) X\u0004 k i \u2211 ( x '\u22c5fk ) X k \uf8f9\n\uf8ee \u2212i \u2211 ( x\u22c5fk ) X k \u2212i \u2211 ( x\u22c5f\u0004k ) X\u0004 k\nk\nk\n\uf8fa\ne\n\u03c1 B (0)e k\ne k\n= TrB \uf8efe\n\uf8ef\uf8f0\n\uf8fa\uf8fb\n\n(3.24)\n\n\u2212i \u2211 g k ( x \u2212 x ')\u22c5( \u03b3 k \u2212Fk )\u2212 2{( yx \u2212 y ' x ')\n( zx\u2212 z ' x ')\n( zy \u2212 z ' y ')\n}\uf8f9\uf8fb\n\uf8f0\n,\n\u00d7e k\nintroduces all the decoherence effects.

Decoherence functions here are structured similarly to those in\n(2.14).\n\n4. Exactly solvable model\nIn this section we discuss an adiabatic model, which is known to be exactly\nsolvable.26 For idling qubits, it is formulated as a model of system-bath interaction, such\nthat no energy exchange is allowed between the system and environment. In other words,\nthe Hamiltonian of the qubit system (1.2) is assumed to commute with the interaction part\n(1.4). Such models are also known as pure-decoherence and quantum-nondemolition\nprocesses.66 For the time-dependent case, we could also consider models with\n[ H S (t ), S ] = 0 . The operators involved are Hermitian and, when commuting, can be\ndiagonalized in the same basis. For interactions involving operators S that have no\ndegenerate eigenstates, this assumption implies that H S (t ) also commutes with itself at\ndifferent times, and\n\uf8ee t\n\uf8f9\n(4.1)\nU S (t ) = exp \uf8ef \u2212i \u222b H S (t ')dt '\uf8fa .\n\uf8ef\uf8f0 0\n\uf8fa\uf8fb\nThe eigenvectors of H S (t ) and S will be denoted as \u03bb , with the eigenvalues E\u03bb (t )\nand \u03bb , respectively.\nThe short-time approximation derived in Section II, is exact for the adiabatic\nmodel. However, the perturbative approach, developed in Section III, is approximate, and\nour explicit result (3.25) for its decoherence functions was derived for the single-qubit\nsituation only. For a qubit-a two state system-a nontrivial interaction operator can be\nassumed proportional to some combination of Pauli matrixes, with symmetric values\n\u03bb \u221d \u00b11 , and therefore its spectrum is indeed nondegenerate. Since all the Pauli matrixes\nare noncommuting, the only adiabatic model that can be constructed will have\nH S (t ) = p (t ) S , where p(t ) is c-number.

The\nprocess of decoherence corresponds to decay of the off-diagonal matrix elements, since\nthe sum over k in the second exponent is a monotonically increasing function of time.\nTo calculate the reduced density matrix using the perturbative approach we notice\nthat Gk (t ) in (3.16) vanishes, while (3.13) and (3.14) give\nsin \u03c9k t\ncos \u03c9k t \u2212 1\n1\n1\nf k (t ) = Tr ( \u03c3 S )\n, f\u0004k (t ) = Tr ( \u03c3 S )\n,\n(4.3)\n2\n2\n\u03c9k\n\u03c9k\nwhere \u03c3 is the vector of the Pauli matrixes.

(4.6)\n2\n\nThe expression for the imaginary part, also proportional to g , is lengthy and is not\nreproduced here. The property\n\n\u2211 x Mx = 1\n\nguarantees that for g = 0 , the coherent\n\ndynamics is reproduced in (4.4).\nAs mentioned earlier, the present approximation depends, in orders higher that\n2\n\ng , on the choice of the axis in the spin space. This property is illustrated in (4.4) as\nfollows. One can show that for S = \u03c3 x , \u03c3 y , \u03c3 z , the imaginary part of Dx,x ' (t ) is zero, and\nthe real part also simplifies so that the summation in (4.4) reproduces the exact solution\n(4.2) for the adiabatic model. For a general choice of S , the perturbative approach\nproduces only approximate results with the expected order- g\n\n3\n\ndeviation, as will be\n\nillustrated in the following calculations.\nIt is convenient to compare (4.2) and (4.4) by evaluating the measure of\ndecoherence introduced in Ref. 32. It is formulated as a norm of the deviation of the\nreduced density matrix from the coherent density matrix, \u03c1C (t ) , of the system,\n\n\u03c7 (t ) = \u03c1 S (t ) \u2212 \u03c1C (t ) .\n\n(4.7)\n\nThe measure is defined in terms of the eigenvalues \u03c2 j (t ) of \u03c7 (t ) ,\n\n\u2013 12 \u2013\n\n\f\u03c7 (t ) \u03bb = max \u03c2 j (t ) .\n\n(4.8)\n\nj\n\nIn Ref. 32, the measure, \u03c7 (t ) \u03bb , was further maximized over all the possible initial states\nof the system, i.e., over \u03c1 S (0) , in order to suppress oscillations at the system's own\nenergy-gap frequencies. For the purposes of comparing the two approximation schemes,\na simpler definition (4.8) is sufficient.\nOur illustrative calculations were carried out for the measure (4.8), assuming the\nOhmic bath, i.e., n = 1 in (2.15), and for T = 0 . The latter choice allows analytical\nevaluation of the integrals. Moreover, for short and intermediate times, small non-zero\ntemperature and T = 0 results are not too different. We also use spherical coordinates52 to\ndefine S and \u03c1 S (0) in the qubit space,\nS = cos \u03c6 s sin \u03b8 s\u03c3 x + sin \u03c6 s sin \u03b8 s\u03c3 y + cos \u03b8 s\u03c3 z ,\n(4.9)\nand\n\n\u03c1 S (0) =\n\n1\n2\n\n(1 + cos \u03c6 \u03c1 sin \u03b8 \u03c1\u03c3 x + sin \u03c6 \u03c1 sin \u03b8 \u03c1\u03c3 y + cos\u03b8 \u03c1\u03c3 z ) .\n\n(4.10)\n\nFigure 1 shows \u03c7 (t ) \u03bb for the adiabatic model, calculated using (4.2) and (4.4). Since\nfor the adiabatic model the short-time approach gives the exact solution, the deviation,\nalso shown in Fig. 1, illustrates the error in the perturbative approximation. We also give\nillustrative values for different bath density of states in Table 1, where \u03c7 (t ) \u03bb for a\n\ncertain t value was calculated for Ohmic, n = 1 , and two super-Ohmic, n = 2,3 , cases,\nsee (2.15).\n\n5. Decoherence of a two-state system in a rotating wave\n\nIn this section we consider an example of time-dependent gate control, introduced\nvia external rotating wave.66 This model is well known and found broad applications. 66,67\nWithout an environmental noise, the model allows an exact solution and the evolution\noperator can be obtained explicitly. We set the Hamiltonian of an idling qubit to\nH i = a\u03c3 z .\n(5.1)\nHere a is half the energy gap between the two qubit levels. The gate control is\nrepresented by\nH g (t ) = c \u03c3 x cos 2at + \u03c3 y sin 2at ,\n(5.2)\n\n(\n\n)\n\nwhere c is the amplitude of the external wave. The wave frequency is tuned in resonance\nwith the qubit. The coherent system evolution operator for (5.1) and (5.2) can be derived\nas\n(5.3)\nU S (t ) = e\u2212iat\u03c3 z e\u2212ict\u03c3 x .\nSuch a gate control can be used, for example, to represent phase and NOT gate\nfunctions46 applied consecutively. Indeed, applying U S (t ) in the form (5.3) for time\n\n\u2013 13 \u2013\n\n\ft = \u03c0 2 a and c = a , one switches the state A + + B \u2212 to A \u2212 \u2212 B + , where + , \u2212\n\nare the eigenstates of the idling two-state system with the Hamiltonian (5.1).\nFor simplicity, we set the system-bath interaction term to be commuting with H i ,\nto represent, if the qubit were idling, the so-called \"pure phase noise\",\n(5.4)\nS =\u03c3z .\nIn the interaction representation, we have\nS (t ) = \u03c3 z cos 2at + \u03c3 y sin 2at .\n(5.5)\nWe begin with the short time approximation. For the bath density of states given\nby (2.15), the integrals in the expression for the decoherence functions D\u03bb\u03bb ' (t ) for T = 0\ncan be calculated analytically. For the Ohmic case, n = 1 , we get\n\n(\n\n)\n\nD\u03bb\u03bb ' (t ) = \u2212 J ( \u03bb \u2212 \u03bb ' ) ln 1 + \u03c9c2t 2 .\n1\n2\n\n2\n\n(5.6)\n\nFor T > 0 , the decoherence functions have been described in the literature; their general\nproperties are known,25,33,60,73 but no closed-form expressions are available. The explicit\nexpression for WS (t ) can be obtained, but it is cumbersome and is not shown here.\nExpressions for the decoherence functions for the perturbative approximation are\nnot available analytically even at zero temperatures due to the complexity of f k , f\u0004k and\n\u03b3 k . These functions, however, do not have any singularities or branch cuts, making\nDxx ' (t ) easy to compute numerically.\nLet us begin by considering the effect of quantum noise on what would be the\ngate-induced oscillation between the + and \u2212 states of an idling qubit in the course of\n\nthe combined \"phase and NOT\" gate function described following (5.3). In Fig. 2, we\nplot the deviation of the actual probability for the qubit to be in the state + , i.e.\n\n\u03c1 S ,++ (t ) \u2261 + \u03c1 S (t ) + , from the coherent-evolution value, i.e., \u03c1C ,++ (t ) \u2261 + \u03c1C (t ) + .\nThe probability of the + state, \u03c1C ,++ (t ) , is also shown. Fig. 2 demonstrates that up to\nthe time of approximately one idling qubit oscillation, the two approximations yield\nvirtually indistinguishable results. Eventually, however, they diverge from each other\nsignificantly. This observation supports the analysis of the omitted corrections made for\nthe short-time approach, see (2.8), and the discussion in Section II. Indeed, in the case of\n(5.1) and (5.2), \u03b5 in (2.8) is of order a, c , which are 1 in dimensionless units of Fig. 2.\nNote that Fig. 2 does not show the phase changes (the off-diagonal matrix\nelements) which are also affected by the decoherence processes. The overall density\nmatrix deviates from coherent even when the deviation for the probability happens to\nvanish, e.g., for the perturbative approximation at a time close to 1.8 a in Fig. 2. To\nshow this, we plot the measure of decoherence \u03c7 (t ) \u03bb , see (4.8), in Fig. 3, for the same\nset of parameters. The short time approximation is consistent with the perturbative one up\nto the times of order 1 a and 1 c , as predicted in Section II, see (2.8).\nIt is instructive to examine the structure of the decoherence functions of the\nperturbative\napproximation\nDxx ' (t ) .\nThere\nare\ntotal\n64\nfunctions\nDxx ' (t ) = Dx =\u00b11, y =\u00b11, z =\u00b11; x '=\u00b11, y '=\u00b11, z '=\u00b11 (t ) . Many of them coincide, and some are zero.\n\u2013 14 \u2013\n\n\fThe nonzero ones are presented on Fig. 4 for the same parameters as used for Fig. 2, and\na somewhat longer time interval. The real parts of the nonzero Dxx ' (t ) separate into two\nbands, as illustrated in Fig. 4, growing on average linearly with time, each with\nsuperimposed oscillations. This defines two different time scales for the decoherence\nprocesses, see (4.7) and (3.23). The reason of the separation may be understood if one\ninvestigates the structure of the first sum in (3.25). When we deal with the adiabatic\nmodel, [U S (t ), S ] = 0 , f k and f\u0004k differ only in magnitude, which results in factorization\nof\n\n{( x \u2212 x ') \u22c5 Tr ( \u03c3S )}2\n\nbefore the integration over the bath modes. This leads to\n\ndecoherence functions with relative values of the real parts determined by the form of S .\nFor example when S = \u03c3 z , one obtains a single non-zero value. Noncommutativity of\nU S (t ) and S introduces a qualitatively different separation. It is now caused by the\ndifference in integrating the two terms of the first sum in (3.25) over the bath modes. In\nthe present example we see, that initially when the short-time and perturbative\napproaches agree (Fig. 3), the two bands (Fig. 4) has no clear separation. The imaginary\npart shows a set of linearly growing phases with superimposed small oscillations, as\nexpected from the structure of (3.25). The contribution of each band of Re Dxx ' (t ) to\ndecoherence depends on the choice of the initial density matrix, with which they are\ninterconnected through M x and Im Dxx ' (t ) , see (3.23).\nNext, let us analyze a \"strong field\" scenario, by setting the amplitude of the\nrotating wave to, e.g., c = 15 a . The measure of decoherence calculated within our two\napproximations is shown in Fig. 5, for two different time scales. Since the general\nexpectation is that the effects of quantum noise should increase with time, the results of\nthe short-time approximation, curve (a) in Fig. 5, suggest that it breaks down here earlier\nthan in the case c = a . This breakdown occurs for times of order 1 c , for which the\nshort-time approximation also visibly deviates from the perturbative one. For larger\ntimes, the short-time approach clearly underestimates decoherence. Heuristic\nobservations based on the monotonic behavior, Fig. 5, and the adiabatic-case calculations\nof the preceding section, suggest that the perturbative approximation has a larger range of\nvalidity in this strong-gate case.\nMore detailed analysis of the calculations with different values of the rotating\nwave amplitude is presented on Fig. 6, where we show the decoherence functions of the\nperturbative approach for varying c . Both bands of the nonzero Re Dxx ' (t ) values\nincrease with increasing c , until c reaches approximately half of \u03c9c . At that point they\nbegin decreasing, as do the imaginary parts of the decoherence functions. Physically,\nsuch a phenomenon can be explained as follows. As the system dynamics, driven by the\nexternal wave, becomes faster than the cutoff frequency of the bath modes, \u03c9c , the\nresonant, energy-exchange relaxation processes are suppressed. The pure-decoherence\ntype, phase noise still remains, and is captured correctly by the perturbative\napproximation, whereas we point out that the short-time approximation is not designed to\ndescribe this regime.\nIn summary, we developed two approximation schemes for evaluating\ndecoherence for gate-controlled quantum systems subject to quantum noise described by\n\n\u2013 15 \u2013\n\n\fa bath of bosonic modes. The short-time approximation is simpler and more versatile, but\nhas a somewhat more limited range of validity, than the perturbative approximation. The\nlatter approximation was worked out in detail only for a single-qubit system. Illustrative\ncalculations were reported for both approximations for the case of the exactly solvable\nadiabatic model and for the rotating-wave quantum-gate model.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors acknowledge support of this research by the National Security\nAgency and Advanced Research and Development Activity under Army Research Office\ncontract DAAD-19-02-1-0035, and by the National Science Foundation, grant DMR0121146.\n\n\u2013 16 \u2013\n\n\fReferences\n\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\n\nB.
