Received ; in original form\n\nABSTRACT\n\nStar formation from matter including the hot CNO processed ejecta of asymptotic\ngiant branch (AGB) winds is regarded as a plausible scenario to account for the\nchemical composition of a stellar second generation (SG) in Globular Clusters (GCs).\nThe chemical evolution models, based on this hypothesis, so far included only the\nyields available for the massive AGB stars, while the possible role of super\u2013AGB\nejecta was either extrapolated or not considered. In this work, we explore in detail the\nrole of super\u2013AGB ejecta on the formation of the SG abundance patterns using yields\nrecently calculated by Ventura and D'Antona.\nAn application of the model to clusters showing extended Na\u2013O anticorrelations,\nlike NGC 2808, indicates that a SG formation history similar to that outlined in our\nprevious work is required: formation of an Extreme population with very large helium\ncontent from the pure ejecta of super\u2013AGB stars, followed by formation of an Intermediate population by dilution of massive AGB ejecta with pristine gas. The present\nmodels are able to account for the very O-poor Na-rich Extreme stars once deep-mixing\nis assumed in SG giants forming in a gas with helium abundance Y> 0.34, which\nsignificantly reduces the atmospheric oxygen content, while preserving the sodium\nabundance. On the other hand, for clusters showing a mild O\u2013Na anticorrelation, like\nM 4, the use of the new yields broadens the range of SG formation routes leading to\nabundance patterns consistent with observations. Specifically, our study shows that\na model in which SG stars form only from super\u2013AGB ejecta promptly diluted with\npristine gas can reproduce the observed patterns. We briefly discuss the variety of\n(small) helium variations occurring in this model and its relevance for the horizontal\nbranch morphology.\nIn some of these models, the duration of the SG formation episode can be as\nshort as \u223c 10 Myr; the formation time of the SG is therefore compatible with the\nsurvival of a cooling flow in the cluster core, previous to the explosion of the SG\ncore collapse supernovae. We also explore models characterized by the formation of\nmultiple populations in individual bursts, each lasting no longer than \u223c10 Myr.\nKey words: globular clusters:general; stars: chemically peculiar; stars:abundances\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe presence of multiple stellar populations, in all globular clusters (GCs) so far spectroscopically examined, is\nshown with convincing evidence in the recent analysis of\n\u22c6\n\nE-mail: annibale.dercole@oabo.inaf.it\n\nc 2011 RAS\n\nCarretta et al. (2009a) of about two thousand stars in 19\nGCs. Each cluster displays a sodium \u2013 oxygen anticorrelation (though the extension of the anticorrelation differ\nfrom cluster to cluster) due to the existence of a population of stars which are richer in sodium and poorer in oxygen than halo stars with the same metallicity. The Na\u2013O\nanti\u2013correlation is typical of GCs, whose constituent stars\n\n\f2\n\nA. D'Ercole et al.\n\nbelong to two or more stellar populations differing in the\nabundances of the elements produced by the hot CNO cycle and by other proton\u2013capture reactions on light nuclei.\nIn fact, these chemical signatures are present also in turn\u2013\noff stars and among the subgiants (e.g. Gratton et al. 2001;\nBriley et al. 2002, 2004), so they can not be due to \"in situ\"\nmixing in the stars, but must be due to some process of\nself\u2013enrichment occurring at the first stages of the cluster\nlife.\nPhotometric evidences for the presence of multiple populations are also numerous, and sometimes suggestive of star\nformation occurring in separate successive bursts. The photometric signatures of different populations can be ascribed\nin part to helium differences, inferred from the morphology of the horizontal branches (HB) (D'Antona et al. 2002;\nD'Antona & Caloi 2004; Lee et al. 2005), or from the presence of multiple main sequences (MS), in \u03c9 Cen (Norris\n2004; Piotto et al. 2005) and NGC 2808 (D'Antona et al.\n2005; Piotto et al. 2007). The strong link between the abundance anomalies (sodium rich and sodium poor groups) in\nthe cluster M 4 (Marino et al. 2008) and their location on\nthe HB is proven by Marino et al. (2011), who find that the\nblue HB stars of M 4 have high sodium, while the red HB\nstars have normal sodium. This supports the interpretation\nthat there is a slight increase in the helium abundance of the\n\"anomalous\" stars (the sodium rich group) (D'Antona et al.\n2002).\nTwo other important links between photometric and\nspectroscopic evidence have been recently given. The first\none comes from the analysis of elemental abundances of two\nmain sequence (MS) stars in NGC 2808 (Bragaglia et al.\n2010) showing that the blue MS star only has \"anomalous\" sodium and aluminum. This supports the interpretation that the blue MS was formed from helium rich, CNO\nprocessed gas. The second link has been stressed most recently by Pasquini et al. (2011) who, directly comparing the\nHe I 10 830 \u00c5 lines in the spectra of two NGC 2808 giants having different O and Na abundances, find direct evidence of a significant He line strength difference. From a\ndetailed chromospheric modeling, they show that the difference in the spectra is consistent and most closely explained\nby an He abundance difference between the two stars of \u2206Y\n>0.17, consistent with the expected difference in abundance\nrequired by stellar models to account for the blue MS.\nBased on these and on a large body of other complex\nevidences, the formation of globular clusters is now schematized as a two\u2013step process, lasting no longer than \u223c100\nMyr, during which the nuclearly processed matter from a\n\"first generation\" (FG) of stars gives birth, in the cluster\ninnermost regions, to a \"second generation\" (SG) of stars\nwith the characteristic signature of a distribution of element\nabundances fully CNO\u2013cycled.\nTwo main scenarios have been proposed to identify the\nmatter constituting the SG stars: these could have formed\neither from the gaseous ejecta of massive asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars (\"AGB scenario\"; Ventura et al.\n2001; D'Antona & Caloi 2004; Karakas et al. 2006) or from\nthe ejecta of fast rotating massive stars (\"FRMS scenario\"; Prantzos & Charbonnel 2006; Meynet et al. 2006;\nDecressin et al. 2007). These studies investigated whether\nthe observed abundance patterns found in GCs can be ac-\n\ncounted for by models. Problems are present in both scenarios (see, e.g., Renzini 2008, for a critical review).\nIn order to go from a \"scenario\" to a \"model\", the SG\nformation must be investigated quantitatively, and must rely\nas far as possible on computed models. From this point\nof view, very few are the \"models\" available in the literature, in spite of the large number of works recently published on this subject. In particular, the O\u2013Na anticorrelation is a signature present in all cluster, but the cluster-tocluster differences are very large: some clusters (the most\nmassive ones) show very extended anticorrelations, down to\nvalues of [O/Fe], more than 1 dex smaller than the values of\nthe FG stars, other clusters show a \"mild\" anticorrelation,\nin which [O/Fe] is reduced by \u223c0.2\u20130.3 dex. In addition,\nCarretta et al. (2009a) point out that there is a direct correlation between the minimum [O/Fe] and the maximum\n[Na/Fe] for the examined clusters. Any model, in the end,\nmust account quantitatively for these features.\nD'Ercole et al. (2008) followed the hydrodynamical formation of a cooling flow at the cluster center that occurs\nfollowing the epoch of supernovae type II (SN II) explosions\n1\n, and the associated loss of the remnant gas from which\nthe FG stars had formed. The cooling flow is due to the\nlow\u2013velocity stellar winds and planetary nebulae of super\u2013\nAGB and massive AGB stars, and meets the physical conditions for a second epoch of star formation. They show that\nthe three populations with different helium content, necessary to explain the presence of a triple main sequence in\nNGC 2808 (D'Antona et al. 2005; Piotto et al. 2007) can be\nreproduced if the most helium rich population forms from\nthe pure ejecta of super\u2013AGB stars, collecting in the cluster\ncore devoid of pristine gas after the end of the SN II epoch.\nAfterwards, pristine gas is re-accreted and mixes with the\nmassive AGB ejecta, giving origin to the Intermediate population having a helium content intermediate between that\nof the AGB and of the pristine gas. This hydrodynamical\nmodel could investigate only the helium content behaviour,\nas the yields of super\u2013AGB stars for elements different from\nhelium were not available at that time.\nIt is important to understand whether the AGB pollution model is consistent with the other abundance patterns\nof GC stars, so D'Ercole et al. (2010) (hereafter D2010) developed a chemical evolution model to test how the O\u2013Na\nand Mg\u2013Al anticorrelations could be built up in different\nclusters. D2010 adopted the Ventura & D'Antona (2009)\nyields for massive AGB ejecta, empirically modified and extrapolated by educated guesses to account for the super\u2013\nAGB ejecta. D2010 reproduced not only the abundance patterns of NGC 2808, but also the very different O\u2013Na abundance pattern of a cluster with a mild O\u2013Na anticorrelation\nlike M 4. The conditions required to reproduce the mild O\u2013\nNa anticorrelations are : 1) that the Exreme population from\npure AGB ejecta could not form in this cluster (and/or in\nclusters with similar patterns); 2) that the dilution with pristine gas, and the consequent intense SG star formation due\nto the increased amount of available gas, had to be delayed\nby \u223c30 Myr after the end of the SN II epoch, a constraint\n\n1\n\nActually, we refer here to the explosion of core-collapse supernovae, thus including also type Ib and Ic; however, for brevity, in\nthe rest of the paper we refer to all these as SN II.\nc 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201314\n\n\fSuper\u2013AGB and GC populations\nthat should be modeled and further explored with appropriate dynamical simulations.\nIn this paper we further extend the models presented in\nour previous work to include the new yields for super\u2013AGB\nmodels from 6.5 to 8 M\u2299 computed by Ventura & D'Antona\n(2011). In Sect. 2 we outline the new complete set of yields\nnow available and introduce a hypothesis of in situ \"deep\u2013\nmixing\", in the high helium red giants, that helps to deal\nwith the extreme oxygen anomalies. In Sect. 3 we summarize the D2010 framework and its relevant parameters. We\npresent our models for the chemical evolution of M 4 in\nSect. 4 and of NGC 2808 in Sect. 5. Interestingly, models\nbased on the new extended set of yields lend further support to our previous models while solving some of their difficulties. In some of M 4 models the second star formation\nepoch may occur in just \u223c10 Myr, so these models are not\nin contrast with the formation of SG massive stars that, exploding as SN II, prevent any further star formation. We\ndiscuss in Sect. 5.3 models including an SN II phase also for\nthe SGs of NGC 2808. We summarize the results and discuss\nthe implications for the initial mass of the FG in Sect 6.\n\n2\n\n3\n\nFigure 1. The yields of metallicity Z=10\u22123 from Ventura &\nD'Antona (2009) from AGB models are plotted as full black\nsquares. Masses from top to bottom are 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6 and\n6.3 M\u2299 . Yields from Ventura & D'Antona (2011) for super\u2013AGB\nmodels of 6.5, 7, 7.5 and 8 M\u2299 are plotted as open black squares.\nRed triangles represent the yields adopted in D'Ercole et al. 2010:\nmasses are 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6, 6.3, 6.5 and 9 M\u2299 .\n\nSUPER\u2013AGB AND AGB YIELDS\n\nIn Table 1 we list the average abundances in the\nejecta of AGB and super\u2013AGB stars adopted in\nthis work. These yields have been calculated by\nVentura & D'Antona (2009) (see their Table 2) and\nfurther extended with the calculations of the yields for\nsuper\u2013AGB stars by Ventura & D'Antona (2011) and\nVentura, Carini & D'Antona (2011). The latter works show\nthe continuity between the two set of yields. The models\nhave been computed by using the same input physics\nand nuclear reaction rates, so the results can be matched\ntogether. We refer to Ventura & D'Antona (2011) also for a\ncomparison with other super\u2013AGB results in the literature\n(notably by Siess 2010). Fig. 1 shows the O\u2013Na yields for\nthese models, together with the yields adopted in D2010.\nNotice that the maximum mass that does not ignite\nas SN II in the super\u2013AGB models here adopted is 8 M\u2299 .\nThus the second generation formation in these new chemical\n<\nevolution models can not start before \u223c\n40Myr from the\nFG birth, as this is the evolutionary time computed for the\n8 M\u2299 star. In D2010 we assumed that super\u2013AGB would\ninclude the 9 M\u2299 star, evolving at \u223c32 Myr. The minimum\nmass leading to SN II explosion (and thus the duration of\nthe SN II epoch) depends mostly on the assumptions made\non the core overshooting during the core hydrogen burning.\nOur models employ a moderately large overshooting (e.g.\nSchaller et al. 1992; Ventura et al. 1998). If this is reduced,\nthe minimum mass of possible SN II progenitors increases,\nand the lifetime of the SN II epoch decreases. This input\ndefines not only the beginning of the phase during which the\nlow velocity winds accumulate for the SG formation (after\nthe FG SN II stage), but also the duration of a possible,\nsubsequent, SG SN II phase (from \u223c30 to \u223c40 Myr, see\nSect. 5.3).\nc 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201314\n\n2.1\n\nSodium\n\nBy increasing the initial mass from 3 M\u2299 to 8 M\u2299 , the Na\nand O values provided by the models ejecta first decrease,\nreach a minimum value in the yields (at masses \u223c6.5 M\u2299 ),\nand then they both revert back toward higher values. Notice that the location in the Na\u2013O plane of the yields of\nsuper\u2013AGBs for the masses 6.56M/ M\u2299 68 is not different\nfrom that of stars with lower masses, it is simply reversed.\nThis behaviour is due to the huge mass loss rates of super\u2013\nAGBs (Ventura & D'Antona 2011) and differs from the values adopted in D2010 in which the last point in the yield\ntable was taken to be at very low oxygen ([O/Fe]=\u20131) and\nmoderate sodium.\nThe comparison between yields and the data for singlemetallicity GCs clearly shows that to reproduce the observed\nNa\u2013O anticorrelation it is necessary to dilute the AGB ejecta\nwith pristine gas (Bekki et al. 2007; D'Antona & Ventura\n2007; D'Ercole et al. 2008, 2010).\nAlthough the yields of massive stars do not show\nthe strong direct correlation of Na and O, but a moderate anticorrelation, dilution is also needed in models\nbased on the FRMS ejecta (Prantzos & Charbonnel 2006;\nDecressin et al. 2007; Lind et al. 2011), and seems to be\npresent in all clusters. Detailed hydrodynamical models able\nto explain the dynamics and the presence of pristine gas during the SG formation are still lacking. The issue of dilution\nis discussed in detail by D'Ercole et al. (2011).\nThe Na abundances adopted in D2010 are +0.3 dex\nlarger than the values reported in Ventura & D'Antona\n(2009) and adopted in the present work. This assumption\nwas necessary to succesfully reproduce the observed anticorrelations, and was theoretically justified by assuming a\n\n\f4\n\nA. D'Ercole et al.\n\nTable 1.

In the present\nwork, use of super\u2013AGB yields makes this adjustment necessary only for the specific case of M 4 in which a 20 Ne\noverabundance is actually present (see Sect. 3).\n20\n\n2.2\n\nOxygen\n\nThe computed super\u2013AGB models show that the sodium\nand oxygen yields increase with the mass, and that [O/Fe]\nnever reaches values smaller than \u22120.4 (cf. Table 1 and\nFig. 1). This behaviour raises a question on the origin of\nthe very low oxygen abundances ([O/Fe]\u223c \u22121) found in\nthe giants of some clusters (these are the stars classified\nas Extreme second generation by Carretta et al. 2009a). We\npropose to solve the issue with a single additional assumption. We attribute the very small oxygen abundances to an\n\"in situ\" deep\u2013mixing, acting only in the progenitors having a very high helium content. In these stars, the small\nmolecular weight discontinuity during the red giant branch\nevolution may not be able to preclude deep-mixing and lowering of oxygen in the envelope. Stars having the largest\nhelium abundances would then signficantly reduce their atmospheric oxygen content, while preserving a similar sodium\nabundance (D'Antona & Ventura 2007)2 . The presence of\n2\n\nHistorically, deep-mixing was modeled in giants starting their\nlife from a standard abundance mixture, and produces a sodium\nincrease concomitant to the oxygen depletion, dealing with regions in which neon has been processed to sodium by proton captures. These models were in reasonable agreement with the whole\nsodium versus oxygen anticorrelation (see, e.g. Weiss, Denissenkov & Charbonnel 2000, their fig. 9), but the deep-mixing\ninterpretation had to be abandoned when the chemical anomalies were shown to be present in turnoff stars. If deep-mixing is\ninstead allowed by the high helium content of the Extreme SG\ncomponent, we must take into account that these stars are formed\nfrom AGB processed matter, in which the initial neon has already\nbeen converted to sodium. In this case, no additional sodium is\n\n[O/Fe] abundances smaller than those predicted by AGB\nmodels only among the giants, and not among the turnoff\nor subgiant stars so far examined (Carretta et al. 2006), and\nin stars belonging to clusters also showing the signature of\na very helium rich MS, such as NGC 2808 and \u03c9 Cen, are\na possible argument in favour of this interpretation. Obviously, the determination of a very low oxygen content -\nsimilar to the one in the most anomalous red giants- in the\natmosphere of blue MS stars in these clusters would falsify\nthis suggestion (Bragaglia et al. 2010, were not able to measure oxygen in their spectrum of the blue MS in NGC 2808.).\nWe apply the following deep-mixing scheme to our models: if a population of SG stars is born from the pure ejecta\nof super\u2013AGB stars and massive AGBs, in which the helium\ncontent is Y>0.34, we assume that the surface abundances\nin the atmospheres of the SG giants is due to deep-mixing;\nas explained above, this has the effect of reducing the oxygen\nabundance while leaving the Na abundance unaltered.\nThe following steps are followed: 1) we examine the helium content in the star\u2013forming gas at each time step; this\nhelium content is the average content of the gas reservoir,\neither due to the super\u2013AGB or AGB ejecta, in absence of\npristine gas, or averaged with the re\u2013accreted pristine gas;\n2) if the helium content in the star forming gas is Y>0.34,\nwe adopt a \"deep\u2013mixing\" scheme to provide the oxygen\ncontent at the surface of giants. In the absence of non parametric models, the relation chosen to fix the oxygen content\nafter the deep-mixing has some degree of arbitrariness. We\ndecided to link the value to the helium abundance of the\ngas forming the stars. [O/Fe] is linearly interpolated between the values \u20130.4 and \u20130.9, assumed respectively for\nhelium content Y=0.34 and Y=0.36. Consequently, when\nthe ejecta of the mass 7.5 M\u2299 form stars, they will reach\nthe minimum oxygen values when evolving as giants. We\nassume: [O/Fe]=\u20130.4\u2013(Y\u20130.343)\u00d737.5. We point out that\n\nproduced inside the star during the hydrogen burning stages, as\nshown by D'Antona & Ventura (2007).\nc 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201314\n\n\fSuper\u2013AGB and GC populations\nthis expression is adopted as an example only, and other \u2013\narbitrary\u2013 formulations could have been chosen. 3) if the average helium abundance is smaller than the values for which\ndeep-mixing occurs, the [O/Fe] of the SG stars is equal to\nthe average between the standard [O/Fe]\u223c0.4 of the pristine\nmatter, and the mildly depleted [O/Fe] of Table 1.\nThis unique assumption on the simulations will change\ndramatically our understanding of the O\u2013Na anticorrelation\nin clusters that do not show extreme anomalies.\n\n2.3\n\nMagnesium and Aluminum\n\nAs for magnesium and aluminum , in this paper\nwe adopt the yields obtained in our standard models\n(Ventura & D'Antona 2009) in which the NACRE upper\nlimits for the aluminum production by proton capture on\n25\nMg and 26 Mg (Angulo et al. 1999) are used. The super\u2013\nAGB computations have shown that the maximum Mg\ndepletion is achieved in models of 5\u20136 M\u2299 , and not in\nthe super\u2013AGB models, contrary to the extrapolation suggested in D2010. The extent of possible variation of Mg\nand Al yields by varying the input physics is discussed in\nVentura, Carini & D'Antona (2011).\n\n2.4\n\nHelium\n\nAs discussed in the literature (Ventura et al. 2002), the helium abundance in the ejecta of massive AGB stars is mainly\ndue to the second\u2013dredge up, as the thermal pulse phase in\nthe mass range of interest for the formation of the second\ngeneration is so short that the episodes of third dredge up\ndo not increase significantly the value achieved at the second dredge up. The same happens in super\u2013AGB stars,\nwhose evolution is faster than that of massive AGBs and\nwhose thermal pulses are less energetic and less effective\nfor what concerns the third dredge up. Therefore, the helium yield of super\u2013AGB stars, contrary to what happens\nfor the other chemical elements of interest here, does not\ndepend on the assumptions made for the mass loss rate.\nThe average helium abundance increases steadily with the\nmass, reaching a maximum value of mass fraction Y=0.359\nfor the 7.5 M\u2299 model. In the 8 M\u2299 evolution, the total helium in the ejecta is down to Y=0.344. As discussed in\nVentura & D'Antona (2011), this is due to the different behaviour of this model, that ignites carbon in the core before\nthe second dredge up. Although the results of the 8 M\u2299 evolution must be taken with caution for what concerns the\nother elemental abundances, that dramatically depend on\nthe huge mass loss suffered by this model (following the\nchoice made in Ventura & D'Antona 2011, for the formulation of the mass loss rate), it is difficult to think that a\ndecrease of the second dredge up effects is physically motivated. Therefore, these models can not explain the Extreme\nmultiple generations of GCs, if we have to take at face value\nthe helium contents Y>0.38 that compete to the blue main\nsequences (Norris 2004; Piotto et al. 2007) or even the value\nY\u223c0.42 attributed to the blue hook stars in NGC 2419 by\ndi Criscienzo et al. (2011). We follow this line of reasoning:\nwe must not take at face value neither the fit of observations with models (see, e.g., the alternative interpretation\nby Portinari et al. 2010, on the Y values to be attributed\nc 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201314\n\n5\n\nto the helium rich main sequence) nor the mediated proposals of precise very large values of Y from the analysis of the\nhorizontal branch stars, as often pointed out by the same authors (D'Antona & Caloi 2008), but only the existence, in\nthese clusters, of well defined helium rich sequences. In the\nabsence of direct measurements of the helium abundance, we\nwill assume that the average value of Y of our super\u2013AGB\nmodels is more than adequate to describe the Extreme populations of these clusters. Notice that Siess (2010), in spite\nof using different physical inputs, reaches a maximum value\n(Y=0.375) in his super\u2013AGB models of the same metallicity.\nOther models in the literature (e.g. Boothroyd & Sackmann\n1999; Doherty et al. 2010; Lagarde et al. 2011) reach values\nof helium abundance in the same range (Y\u223c0.33 \u2013 0.38),\nin spite of differences in codes, numerical inputs and physical approaches in the mixing formulation (see for discussion Ventura 2010 and D'Antona, Charbonnel et al. 2012, in\npreparation).\n\n3\n\nTHE CHEMICAL EVOLUTION MODEL\n\nThe chemical evolution is computed following equations 2\u20135\nof D2010. According to the framework presented in D2010,\nFG stars are already in place and have the same chemical\nabundances of the pristine gas from which they form; the\nSG stars form from super\u2013AGB and AGB ejecta gathering\nin the cluster centre through a cooling flow and partially\ndiluted with pristine gas accreting on the cluster core with\n(possibly) a time delay with respect to the beginning of the\nSG formation epoch.\nIn order to preserve the cooling flow, we still assume\nthat only SG stars that do not explode as SN II can form\n(D'Ercole et al. 2008).3 Another reason to exclude the SG\nSN II is that normally GCs show a very small spread of iron\n(Carretta et al. 2009c), indicating that the SG stars hardly\nhave been polluted by SN II ejecta (neither of the FG nor of\nthe SG). The parameters characterizing the model are the\nsame ones listed in D2010:\n(i) tacc : time at which the maximum accretion of pristine\nmatter occurs;\n(ii) \u03c4pri : timescale of the pristine gas accretion process;\n(iii) tend : time at which the SG star formation ends;\n(iv) \u03c1\u2217,FG : densiy of FG stars;\n(v) \u03c10,pr : densiy regulating the amount of available pristine gas, normalized to \u03c1\u2217,FG ;\n(vi) \u03bd: star formation efficiency\n(vii) x = \u03c1\u2217,SG /\u03c1\u2217tot : ratio between the SG stars and the\ntotal nowadays alive stars (\u03c1\u2217,tot = \u03c1\u2217,FG + \u03c1\u2217,SG )\nAn exploration of this whole set of parameters has been\npresented in D2010. In the following we will vary only the\nmost critical parameters (tacc , \u03c4pri , tend , \u03bd and \u03c10,pr ). Notice that tend is not necessarily linked to tacc and \u03c4pri , as\nthe phenomenon causing the end of the SG star formation\n(e.g. the phase of type I supernova explosions, cf. D2010)\nis not related. The ratio x, in most GCs, is larger than 0.5\n\n3\n\nThe following will show that this limitation in the IMF can\nbe relaxed for clusters showing a mild O\u2013Na anticorrelation, see\nSect. 5.3.\n\n\f6\n\nA.

This current value depends not only on the duration and efficiency\nof the star formation of the SG, but also on the subsequent\nloss of FG stars (see, e.g. D'Ercole et al. 2008). Although\nthe loss of FG stars does not enter directly into the models\n(it is in fact absent in equations 2\u20135 of D2010), its value can\nbe inferred a posteriori from the fit of specific data for the\nclusters. In the examples of Sect. 4 we adopt x = 0.4 or 0.5\nfor NGC 2808 and x = 0.5 or 0.7 for M 4.\nThe initial values for the pristine gas abundances can\nbe inferred from the observed data. For example, the initial\nMg and Al abundances in the cluster M 4 must be consistent with the observed values [Mg/Fe]=0.5 and [Al/Fe]=0.5,\nwhile we adopt more standard values of [Mg/Fe]=0.3 and\n[Al/Fe]=0 for the initial abundances in NGC 2808. M4 FG\nstars also exhibit a small increase (\u223c +0.05dex) in the initial oxygen content. This calls for a variation of the Mg\nand Al abundances of the AGB ejecta given in Table 1, as\nthese latter are computed for the initial values [Mg/Fe]=0.4\nand [Al/Fe]=0. Magnesium and Aluminum were modified on\nthe basis of the details of the various channels of the Mg-Al\nnucleosynthesis, discussed in Ventura, Carini & D'Antona\n(2011). The change in the oxygen yields is simpler, because\nthis element is destroyed with continuity during the whole\nAGB phase, which allows a straight scaling relation. Further, the overabundance of \u03b1-elements in M 4 should also\nimply an overabundance of neon. Adopting the relation discussed in D2010 for the sodium production by AGB stars\n(\u03b4 [Na/Fe]\u2243 \u03b4[20 Ne/Fe]), we increased the sodium yield values of Table 1 only for the specific case of M 4. Table 3\nsummarizes all the variations adopted in our models.\n\n4\n4.1\n\nRESULTS: M 4\nContinuous star formation\n\nIn D2010 we presented a model to fit the M 4 O\u2013Na and\nMg\u2013Al data by Marino et al. (2008). In Fig. 2 we reproduce\na model with the same dynamics (M 4-0 in Table 2) but with\nthe abundances calculated using the new Table 1 (and Table\n3). The bottom right panel shows the role of ejecta (dash\u2013\n\ndotted line) and of the pristine gas accretion (long\u2013dashed\nline) and their timing in the detailed formation of the SG\n(dashed line). The bulk of the SG formation occurs when the\npristine matter is re-accreted, at \u223c65 Myr, and lasts for \u223c40\nMyr more. The dashed lines in the left panels show the path\nof the O\u2013Na and Mg\u2013Al abundances along the simulation.\nWe see that, when dilution with pristine matter sets in, the\nvalues tend towards the FG abundances. As we discussed in\nD2010, this choice of input parameters provides agreement\nwith the data if the sodium abundance is assumed to be\nlarger by +0.1 dex, with respect to the yields adopted in that\nwork, that is, larger by +0.3 dex with respect to Table 1.\nAs discussed in Sect. 2.1, this would mean to assume that\nthe neon abundance in the gas forming the FG stars of M 4\nis +0.3 dex larger than in other cluster\u2013forming regions,\nin particular in NGC 2808, for which we used directly the\nvalues in Table 2. The top right panel of Fig. 2 shows the\nhelium distribution. The total spread is \u03b4Y\u223c0.04, and could\nbe revealed by a careful analysis of the MS.\nThe new super\u2013AGB yields broaden the range of possible star formation routes that can satisfactorily fit the M 4\ndata, showing that different re-accretion histories may lead\nto similar mild O\u2013Na anticorrelations found in numerous\nGCs. In the new models star formation can begin much earlier: a first example is shown in Fig. 3 (case M 4-1). The\nstar formation efficiency in this model has still the low value\n\u03bd=0.1 assumed in the previous case, and no star forms directly from super\u2013AGB ejecta (as we see from the distribution of the helium abundance). Here (and in all the following\nmodels of M 4) the adopted excess of sodium abundance is\nreduced to \u03b4[Na/Fe] = 0.2, and we assume x=0.5 instead of\n0.7 considered in the previous model for the sake of comparison with the model of D2010. A fraction of 50% of FG stars\nis in fact consistent with the fraction of red HB stars given\nin Marino et al. (2008). Recent analysis of UV based colors\nof the red giants actually show that the RG branch is splitted into a Na\u2013rich (redder) and Na\u2013normal (bluer) part, in\nbalanced numbers (Milone 2011, private communication).\nModel M 4-1 requires the presence of pristine gas since\nthe early phases of SG formation to efficiently dilute the\nsuper\u2013AGB matter.

As discussed in Sect.2.2, the oxygen content is not reduced by deep-mixing: the SG ends up forming\na group of stars with relatively large sodium (also thanks\nto the inclusion of \u03b4[Na/Fe]=+0.2 in the yield table, as discussed above), but with oxygen depleted only by \u223c0.1 dex.\nThe small helium spread shown by this simulation is probably undetectable on the main sequence, but can lead to a\ndistribution of the HB stars such that the Na\u2013rich stars are\nbluer than the Na\u2013normal stars, as found by Marino et al.\n(2011).\nWe also run the model M 4-2 (Fig. 4) to illustrate how\nacceptable solutions can be obtained even for significantly\nshorter evolutionary times. This shows that this kind of\nmodels are flexible enough to reproduce the observations\nin a variety of conditions; this also means, however, that\nthese models can provide only limited constraints on the\ngas hydrodynamics and the related star formation history.\n\n1\n0.2\n\n0.8\n\n0.15\n\n0.6\n0.4\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.05\n\n0\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0\n0.2\n\n0.25\n\n0.3\n\n[Mg/Fe]\n\n0.35\n\n0.4\n\nY\n\n0.8\n-1\n0.6\n0.4\n-2\n0.2\n0\n\n-3\n\n-0.2\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n[O/Fe]\n\n4.2\n\nStar formation after gas accumulation\n\nIn Fig. 5 we model a different case (M 4-3). Here we adopt\n\u03bd=0.5, and let the super\u2013AGB ejecta and pristine gas accumulate up to an age of 45 Myr, when a burst of formation\noccurs, lasting until a total age tend =50 Myr. The process of\nSG formation must stop very soon with these parameters.\nIn Fig.6 (case M 4-4), we assume tend =55 Myr, and\na small tail of stars with larger helium content (and lower\n[O/Fe]) is formed from pure AGB ejecta in the time interval\n50\u201355 Myr; such a tail is not present in the data, but it\nis possible to increase \u03c4pri to avoid this problem. Our aim\nhere is to show how much a small variation of the input\nparameters may lead to different results, when SG stars form\nfrom super\u2013AGB ejecta, i.e. when, contrary to model M 4-0,\nshorter evolutive times are involved.\nTo further illustrate this point, we show another simulation in Fig. 7 (Case M 4-5), with a longer timescale for\nthe SG formation. Interesting to notice, the helium content\nof the SG is again only slightly increased, but here it is well\nseparated from the FG value. Possibly, a careful color analysis of the main sequence width following the lines described,\ne.g., by Milone et al. (2011a) could reveal this bimodality\nin helium abundance, and discriminate between this model\nand the previous one. Models similar to this one may be\nable to reproduce the abundances in other clusters showing\na bimodal HB.\nc 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201314\n\nFigure 2.

Data (open circles) are from Marino et al. (2008).\nSquares and triangles represent a sampling of the SG and FG\nstars by our model, respectively.The dashed lines represent the\ngas trajectory within the diagrams; the sampled stars in principle\nwould be located on this line, but we introduced a random scatter\nin the range 0.1 dex in their coordinates in order to mimic the\nobservational errors. The top-right panel illustrates the stellar\nHe distribution. In the bottom-right panel the evolution of the\nfollowing quantities is reported: total amount of gas (solid line),\nstellar ejecta (dot-dashed line), pristine gas (long-dashed line),\nSG stars (dashed line).\n\n4.3\n\nWhich model is more adequate?\n\nThus, there are two main different modalities in which the\nAGB pollution may lead to a viable model for M 4: either the\nre-accretion of pristine gas is delayed by more than 20 Myr\n(model M 4-0 and D2010), or it occurs early after the SN II\nepoch (models M 4-2 and following). The choice between\nthese possibilities can rely upon the distribution of other elemental abundances in the FG and SG. In particular, the\nmodel M 4-0 shows a small increase in the aluminum abundance of the SG (Fig. 2, top left panel). Marino et al. (2008)\ndata, and also the recent data by Villanova & Geisler (2011),\ndo not show a clear aluminum trend.

At a given age, the mass of stars\nevolving off the main sequence is smaller for larger helium\nabundances. This implies that, for a similar mass loss, stars\nwith a larger helium abundance end up with a smaller mass\nand thus at a bluer location on the HB. Depending on the\nmetallicity, a very small helium increase (from Y=0.24 to\nY\u22430.27) is necessary to produce the gap -a real lack of stars\nin the RR Lyr region- between the red clump and the blue\nHB in NGC 2808 (D'Antona & Caloi 2004).

The burst of star formation occurs after\naccumulation until an age of 48 Myr: FG and SG stars are born\nwith a finite, although very small, difference in helium content\n(symbols as in Fig. 2).\n\nM 4, having a more continuous distribution between red and\nblue, with the presence of several RR Lyr stars, the helium\nvariations may have been less abrupt. Marino et al. (2011)\nfound that the blue HB stars of M 4 have high Na, while the\nred HB stars have normal Na. Furthermore, Villanova et al.\n(2012) have recently observed six blue HB stars in M 4,\nfinding that they have high Na, low O and helium content\nY\u223c0.29. A similar location of Na\u2013rich, O\u2013poor stars at the\nblue side of the HB has been recently discovered by Gratton et al. (2011) in NGC 2808, confirming the scenario. We\nremark that this same analysis shows a mild anticorrelation\nof the color with the Na/O ratio within the red clump stars,\nso that, contrary to the simple interpretation, even the red\nside of the HB may be not fully populated by FG stars, but\nalso by a few SG stars having a helium content barely larger\nthan the FG value. Also in NGC 1851 Gratton et al. (2012)\nhave found a few Na-rich stars at the hotter end of the red\nclump. These cases show that extreme care is necessary before drawing firm conclusions on the number ratio of FG to\nSG stars from simplified analyses. .\nFigure 8 illustrates the different ways in which helium\nis correlated to sodium in our simulations. While in model\nM4-0 the difference in helium between SG and FG stars is\n\u03b4Y> 0.02, other models have a population of SG stars at\nY\u223c 0.25 (model M4-2) or 0.255 (model M4-4). Model M 4\u2013\n5 shows that it is possible to obtain a mono\u2013helium SG (in\nour case Y\u223c0.26) with a large sodium spread. From these\nexamples, it appears that the models employing the super\u2013\nAGB may be able to explain the presence of SG stars on\nthe blue side of the red clump of NGC 18514 (see Sect. 5 for\n4\n\nWe must keep in mind that the case of NGC1851, however,\nis more complex than those we are exploring here.

Quantitative simulations of the HB\nin this and other clusters might help to determine which\nof the models presented is the best. While these simulations are outside the scope of this paper, we point out that\nthe models presented can potentially explain a variety of\ndifferent HB morphologies and can be tested by spectroscopic observations similar to those by Marino et al. (2011);\nVillanova et al. (2012)5 .\nWe summarize these results by concluding that:\n(i) The mild O\u2013Na anticorrelation and the small \u2013 if any\n\u2013 variation in helium shown by a class of GCs can be due to\npollution of super\u2013AGB stars into the re\u2013accreted pristine\ngas forming the second generation stars. The needed ingredient is that the pristine matter falls back to the cluster core\nvery soon after it has been totally removed from the cluster,\nduring the FG SN II epoch.\n(ii) Another important outcome of the simulations including the super\u2013AGB ejecta is that the SG formation phase\ncan have a short duration (\u223c 10-20 Myr) and does not need\nto extend up to \u223c 100 Myr (as found by D2010). The models characterized by a shorter SG formation epoch, on the\nnecessary to explain the complex features of its CM diagram (see\nGratton et al. 2012 for further discussion).\n5 We comment, in passing, on the case of NGC 6397, a cluster having a short HB and a thin MS, both indicative of scarce\nstar\u2013to\u2013star differences in helium (di Criscienzo et al. 2010) but\na significant spread in sodium. This latter was assumed by\n(Carretta et al. 2010) to correspond to the mixture of FG plus\nSG stars, with \u223c30% of stars belonging to the FG. We can not\nmodel NGC 6397 with the present yields, as it has a much smaller\nmetallicity, but we remark that it can be reanalysed in terms of\na model similar to the SG of model M 4\u20135 in Fig. 8, assuming\nthat the FG of NGC 6397 has been fully lost, as suggested by\nD'Antona & Caloi (2008).\n\n\f10\n\nA.

Models with a short SG formation phase can be compatible with a\nsecond phase of SN II explosions due to the evolution of SG\nmassive stars, thus relaxing any assumption of anomalous\nIMF.\n(iii) As an aside of the previous point, we stress that a\nshorter SG formation implies that the mass range of the\nAGB progenitors providing polluted ejecta for the SG formation is narrower and, therefore, that these models require a\nmore massive FG cluster to be able to produce the observed\namount of SG stars. Models with a short SG formation phase\ntypically require an initial FG mass 3\u20134 times larger than\nthat needed in models with a more extended SG formation\nphase.\n\nRESULTS: NGC 2808\n\n0\n\n[O/Fe]\n\nFigure 9.

After the phase of formation from\nc 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201314\n\n\fSuper\u2013AGB and GC populations\nsuper\u2013AGB ejecta, the peak value of re\u2013accretion occurs at\ntacc =58 Myr (cf. the bottom right panel). The epoch from\n>\n38.9 to \u223c\n\u223c50 Myr corresponds to the formation of the\nExtreme population, with Y\u223c0.35. This accounts for the\npresence of the blue main sequence. The following dilution\nphase leads to the formation of a less extreme SG (Y\u223c0.3)\nthat populates the intermediate main sequence of this cluster.\nThe top left panel of figure 9 shows the Mg and Al\npredictions. Using the new yields for Mg and Al listed in\nTable 1 does not allow the fit of the three Mg\u2013poor giants (\u03b4[Mg/Fe]\u223c\u20130.6) observed by Carretta et al. 2009b.\nVentura, Carini & D'Antona (2011) deal extensively with\nthe Mg\u2013Al problem in the models, and show that small adjustments to the cross sections (concerning the Mg isotopes)\nmay well reproduce the [Mg/Fe]\u2013[Al/Fe] value of the blue\nMS stars observed by Bragaglia et al. (2010) and shown in\nFig. 9 with the star symbol. In particular, an increase by\na factor two of the cross section 25 Mg(p,\u03b3)26 Al shifts the\n6 M\u2299 yield in the region occupied by the M 13 giants and\nby the MS star of NGC 2808. Such an increase is also consistent with recent new measurements of the reaction rate\n(LUNA Collaboration et al. 2011).\nThe difference in Mg between the MS stars and\nthe giants can not be attributed to further dilution in\nthe red giants, as magnesium is not touched in the\nred giant evolution of low mass stars, not even in\nthe interior (D'Antona & Ventura 2007). Figure 5 in\nVentura, Carini & D'Antona (2011) shows the Mg\u2013Al data\nin the literature for the clusters NGC 6752, M 15, NGC\n2808 and M 13, and the results of different modeling of the\nyields in the chemistry evolution of a 6 M\u2299 star as adopted\nin this paper. Apart from two giants in M 15, a cluster whose\nmetal abundance is much smaller than the others, no star\nhas Mg abundances as low as those in the three UVES giants\nof NGC 2808, that are not compatible with the models. As\nthese three stars constitute a problem for any other pollution\nmodel, and can not be explained in the deep extra mixing\nframework as well, we defer the study of this problem to a\nfuture investigation.\nLet us now consider the [Na/Fe]-[O/Fe] diagram (bottom left panel of Fig. 9). While in the case of M 4-0 the new\nsimulation is very similar to that presented in D2010 for the\nabsence of an Extreme population, here the new super\u2013AGB\nsodium yields are able to account for the high sodium values\nof the stars with upper limit only available for oxygen (full\nsquares); this results ensues from the deep-mixing hypotesis,\nand the subsequent reduction of the oxygen values given by\nthe recipe described in Sect. 2.2. The open squares represent\nthe values of oxygen that should be found in turnoff stars for\nthe stars with Y>0.34, as in these stars deep-mixing has not\nyet taken place. These stars, as well as blue MS stars, should\nbe characterized by oxygen abundances larger than those of\ngiant stars and fall along the Na-O curve determined by the\nnew yields and shown in Fig. 1, a prediction that can be\nfalsified by spectroscopic observations.\nThe top right panel of Fig. 9 shows the histogram of\nthe distribution of helium abundances. The number ratio of\nthe Intermediate and Extreme populations of the SG depends on the initial mass function and on the timing and\nextent of the dilution with pristine gas, and thus this is a\npowerful constraint for the successful models. The observed\nc 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201314\n\n11\n\nnumber ratios of the three populations differing in helium\ncontent in NGC 2808 is constrained by two different sets of\nobservations:\n(i) the number counts of the HB stars (Bedin et al. 2000).\nThese numbers were the basis of the interpretation of the HB\nin terms of multiple populations with different helium content (D'Antona & Caloi 2004; D'Antona et al. 2005), providing fractions of 50%, 35% and 15%, respectively, for the\ngroups of standard helium (red clump stars), intermediate\nhelium (blue luminous HB, named EBT1) and high helium\n(sum of the EBT2 and EBT3 extensions of the blue HB).\n(ii) the number counts in the triple MS. Milone et al.\n(2011b) recently re\u2013analyzed the data by Piotto et al. (2007)\nin order to derive the mass functions of the three populations. According to this analysis, the fractions of standard\n(red MS), intermediate (middle MS) and high helium (blue\nMS) stars are respectively 62%, 24% and 14%. Therefore,\nwhile the fraction of FG stars changes from \u223c50 to \u223c60%,\nthe proportion of Intermediate and Extreme population are\nvery similar in the two analyses: the Extreme population is\n\u223c35% of the whole SG.\nIn the present models for NGC 2808 we set x = 0.4\u22120.5,\nthat is, we assume that the fraction of FG stars, with standard helium content Y=0.24, is 60-50%, and set the other\ninput parameters in order to obtain a reasonable result for\nthe number ratio of the Extreme and Intermediate SG.\nFrom the above discussion it is clear that, contrary to\nthe case of M 4, there is less freedom in the choice of the\nparameters because of the presence of the Extreme population and the need to reproduce the right proportion among\nthe Extreme, the Intermediate and the Primordial populations (cf. the three peaks in the He histogram in Fig. 9).\nSome degree of flexibility is still present though. Figure 10\nshows another model for NGC 2808, whose input is model\nNGC 2808-1 in Table 2. In the left panels we see that, as for\nthe model NGC 2808-0, when dilution with pristine matter\nsets in, the model trajectories (dashed line) tend towards the\nFG abundances, but, during the last 10\u201315 Myr, star formation occurs again in mostly undiluted AGB ejecta, and the\nabundances revert back to lower O and larger Na values. In\nfact, this last phase of star formation is necessary to fill the\ngap in O, Na values between the formation of the Extreme\npopulation (with very large Y, corresponding to the blue\nMS) and the Intermediate population with strong dilution.\nThe bump in the helium distribution between the peaks at\nY=0.3 and Y=0.35 (top right panel) forms during this same\nstage as well. And also the stars with very large [Al/Fe] in\nthe simulation (upper left panel) form in this last epoch of\nstar formation. This can be understood by looking at the\nabundances listed in Table 1, showing that the maximum\nabundance in Al and maximum depletion in Mg are reached\nwith the evolution of the 5.5 M\u2299 (at about 85 Myr).\n\n5.2\n\nStar formation after gas accumulation\n\nWe now focus on Fig. 11 that shows the results of the model\nNGC 2808\u20132, having the same input parameters of model\nNGC 2808\u20131, but dealing with a different hypothesis for\nthe star formation: here we assume that SG formation does\nnot start immediately after the end of the SN II epoch, but\n\n\f12\n\nA.

We have tried to model in detail the three\npopulations of NGC 2808 by making the assumption that,\n\u223c10 Myr after the Extreme population began to be formed\nin the cluster, a new phase of SN II begins. This will hamper\nstar formation until the end of the SN II phase.\n<\nIn our models, this phase lasts for \u223c\n38 Myr (Table 1).\n\n70\n\n0.2\n1\n\nthat gas accumulates from 40 to 50 Myr, and then a star\nformation burst occurs.\nThe results are very similar, but the Extreme population does not reach the high sodium abundances obtained\nin the model NGC 2808\u20131; this is a consequence of the fact\nthat, before the SG formation starts, the ejecta of the stars\nbetween 8 M\u2299 and \u223c7.3 M\u2299 mix, so that the highest abundances are lowered.\n\n60\n\n[O/Fe]\n\nFigure 12.

Increasing the infall of pristine matter, the O\u2013Na\ndata come very close to the FG values (bottom panel) (symbols\nas in Fig. 9).\n\nWe can have a second burst of star formation from the AGB\nejecta starting at \u223c90 Myr. We have discussed in Sect. 2 that\nthe time hiatus between the two bursts may be reduced to\n\u223c30 Myr for models employing a smaller core\u2013overshooting.\nThus we employ in the following \u223c30 Myr as total duration\nof the SG SN II epoch8 .\n\n8 Notice that the timing of each mass for our simulations, given\nin Table 1, is still adopted in the same way in these models.\n\nc 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201314\n\n\fSuper\u2013AGB and GC populations\nThe main difficulty encountered in models including\nSN II explosions from the Extreme SG is to reproduce at\nthe same time the extension and distribution of stars along\nthe O\u2013Na anticorrelation and the helium distribution function.\n\u2022 Case NGC 2808-3 (Fig. 12): In this model we stop\nthe SG formation from pure ejecta at 50 Myr, allow for a\n>\n\u223c 30 Myr period without star formation, and then resume\nstar formation from the AGB ejecta mixed with pristine gas,\nwith a choice of tacc =87 Myr. The clumps in the distribution\nof stars in the O\u2013Na plane are probably too separated to be\nconsistent with the observations. Moreover, in order to obtain a reasonable number ratio between the Extreme stars\n(Y>0.34) and the Intermediate population (Y\u223c0.30), we are\nforced to extend the star formation of this latter population\nto \u223c20 Myr, much longer than allowed by the beginning of\nthe new (third) SN II epoch.\n\u2022 Case NGC 2808-4 (Fig. 13, top panel): this model is\nidentical to NGC 2808-3, but we limit the formation of the\nIntermediate population to 90 Myr: as discussed above, the\nIntermediate population is a bare 11%, too small to reproduce the number ratio of the Extreme\u2013 and Intermediate\u2013\nhelium MS.\n\u2022 (Case NGC 2808-5, Fig. 13, bottom panel): we increase\nthe relative number of Intermediate population stars by increasing the dilution. The second peak of helium content\noccurs at Y\u223c0.28, and the number ratio of Extreme and\nIntermediate population becomes reasonable, but the O\u2013\nNa values become much too close to the FG values, due to\nthe strong dilution (a problem discussed in D'Ercole et al.\n(2011) in a different context).\nWe find then that these simulations do not reproduce\nthe observations so well as models NGC 2808-1 and 2.\nNevertheless, the variety of observational results for different clusters may have their explanation in the variety\nof relevant parameters. For instance, model NGC 2808-4\n(Fig. 13 top panel) could be relevant to explain the horizontal branch stellar distribution of the cluster NGC 2419\n(di Criscienzo et al. 2011).\n\n6\n\n13\n\nWhile models with a shorter SG formation epoch can include the effect of SG SN II, the narrower range of AGB\nprogenitors providing gas for SG formation implies that they\nrequire a larger FG initial mass (by a factor 3-4 compared\nto models with a more extended SG formation phase).\n\u2022 In order to account for the O-poor Na-rich stars of NGC\n2808 we assumed the presence of deep-mixing in SG giants\nforming in a gas with helium abundance Y> 0.34, which\nsignificantly reduces the atmospheric oxygen content, while\npreserving the sodium abundance. The use of the super\u2013\nAGB yields does not change the main requirements on SG\nformation history of models for the more complex clusters\nlike NGC 2808. In these clusters, an Extreme population\nwith very large helium content form from the pure ejecta of\nsuper\u2013AGB stars, followed by formation of an Intermediate\npopulation by dilution of massive AGB ejecta with pristine\ngas. We also attempted to model the three populations of\nNGC 2808 allowing for a long hiatus between the formation\nof the Extreme and Intermediate population (possibly due\nto SN II explosions of the Extreme populations), but our\nattempts to model each star formation epoch in a period as\nshort as \u223c10 Myr were not satisfactory. Nevertheless, further\nstudy is probably needed to settle this issue.\nWe finally want to point out that one-zone models such\nas those presented here (and in D2010), while very useful to\nunderstand rather easily and very quickly the role of different ingredients in shaping the GC chemical evolution (AGB\nejecta, amount of pristine gas, duration of the system evolution, etc.), cannot of course capture the complexity and\nvariety of effects connected with the gas hydrodynamics. As\na simple example, we mention that, during the cooling flow\nevolution of the GC gas (c.f. D'Ercole et al. 2008), most of\nit cumulates in the centre of the cluster which therefore at\neach time hosts not only the AGB ejecta delivered \"in situ\",\nbut also that delivered at earlier times by FG stars located\nat the GC outskirts. It is thus expected that SG stars with\ndifferent chemical properties can form in different places at\nthe same time, and not only at different times as in one-zone\nmodels. For this reason we plan to work out hydrodynamic\nmodels similar to those of D'Ercole et al. (2008), but taking\ninto account the detailed chemistry as in the present models.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn this paper we have explored the possible role of superAGB in the formation of the observed abundance patterns\nin multiple-population globular clusters. Our models are\nbased on the set of yields calculated by Ventura & D'Antona\n(2009, 2011). The results of our investigation show that the\nnew super\u2013AGB yields broaden the range of possible formation histories leading to the observed abundance patterns.\nSpecifically:\n\u2022 we have built models for M 4, a cluster representative\nof numerous other GCs characterized by a shorter Na\u2013O\nanticorrelation. For this cluster, we show that the observed\nabundance pattern can be reproduced also by models with\na short SG formation phase (\u223c 10-20 Myr) involving only\nsuper-AGB ejecta and pristine gas. We confirm that models\npresented in our previous work (D'Ercole et al. 2010) which\nare characterized by a more extended SG formation epoch\ninvolving super\u2013AGB and AGB ejecta (along with pristine\ngas) can also reproduce the observed abundance patterns.\nc 2011 RAS, MNRAS 000, 1\u201314\n\n7\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nWe thank Raffaele Gratton for useful comments that helped\nus to clarify and further expand some of the points presented\nin the paper.
