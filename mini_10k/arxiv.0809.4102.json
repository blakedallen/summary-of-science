The five dimensional metric has a solution:\nds2 = e\u2212krc |\u03c6| \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd dx\u03bc dx\u03bd + rc2 d\u03c62\n\n(1.1)\n\nwhere k is of the order of Planck scale (MP l ) and rc specifies the radius of the extra\ndimension. Two 3-branes are located at the orbifold fixed points \u03c6 = \u03c0 (visible) and \u03c6 = 0\n(hidden). Due to warping of 4D space-time metric all the fundamental scalar masses get\nrescaled on the visible brane and a fundamental mass (m0 ) of Planck scale order comes\ndown to a physical mass scale (m) of order TeV on the visible brane through the relation\n: m = m0 e\u2212krc \u03c0 . In the RS model the radius of extra dimension is suitably fine tuned\nas krc \u2248 12 so that the gauge hierarchy problem can be resolved without introducing any\nintermediate mass scale in the theory. This can be achieved by choosing k ( which is related\nto the bulk cosmological constant) and the inverse of rc of the order of Planck mass. However\nwithout any dynamical basis for this fine tuning, it became imperative to introduce dynamics\nwhich determines a stabilized location of the TeV brane relative to the Planck brane.\nIt was proposed by Goldberger and Wise (GW) [4] that the dynamics of a five dimensional\nbulk scalar field in such models could stabilize the size of the extra dimension to it's desired\nvalue. In this mechanism the effective potential for the modulus has been generated by\nthe total action integral of a bulk scalar field with quartic interactions localized in two 3branes. The bulk scalar then acts like a spring between the branes, whose gradient energy\nbecomes repulsive if the branes get too close, and whose potential energy (from m2 \u03c62 ) causes\nattraction if the branes separate too much. In this way the minimum of the modulus ( brane\nseparation) potential yields a compactification scale in terms of the ratio of VEV's of the\nscalar fields at the two branes which solves the gauge hierarchy problem without fine tuning\nany of the parameter of the theory. Initially GW neglected the back reaction of the bulk\nscalar on the geometry as well as on the brane tensions. Later the back reaction has been\nincluded in [5] and some critical studies have been done in [6]. Several variations of the GW\nmechanism in higher dimensions [7], in cosmological braneworlds [8] and with non minimal\n2\n\n\fscalar fields [9] have been studied rigorously. This stabilization mechanism has also been\ngeneralized for supersymmetric warped space-times [9].\nIn the present work we will apply the GW mechanism of radius stabilization in the\nbraneworld model with nonzero brane cosmological constant. As can be seen that the\noriginal Randall-Sundrum model started with flat 3-branes, it has been shown in [2] that\none can indeed generalize the model with non-zero cosmological constant on the brane and\nstill can have Planck to TeV scale warping from the resulting warp factor. Different values of\nthe inter-brane separation modulus for different values for the brane cosmological constant\n(\u03a9) are obtained through their functional relation such that the gauge hierarchy problem\nis resolved for this entire region of the parameter space. The analysis has been done for\nboth de-Siiter and anti-de Sitter TeV branes by choosing appropriate signature for \u03a9 and\nthe corresponding brane tensions have been determined. Motivations for this analysis as\nwell as that presented in this work have their roots in the observational support in favour\nof de-Sitter-like character of our universe. The present accelerating phase of our universe\ncan be explained by the presence of a small but positive cosmological constant whose value\nis estimated to be \u223c 10\u2212124 in Planck unit. Despite such a tiny value it is responsible in\ninducting such a large acceleration to the expansion of the universe. It is therefore worthwhile\nto to explore the effects of a non-vanishing cosmological constant on the brane particularly\nin the context of gauge hierarchy and modulus stabilization.\nIn this work we study the stabilization of such a generalized RS model in the light of\nGoldberger-Wise mechanism by introducing a scalar field in the bulk. We show that such\na stabilization is indeed possible and the stable value of the modulus depends on the value\nof the brane cosmological constant. However for a given value of the cosmological constant\nthe corresponding stable value of the modulus will resolve the gauge hierarchy problem also\nonly when the value of the cosmological constant is vanishingly small. In other words\nthe modulus-cosmological constant relation to resolve the gauge hierarchy problem and\nthe modulus -cosmological relation to achieve stability will have common solution only in\nthe region of vanishingly small cosmological constant. We shall discuss these issues more\nquantitatively in the context of the presently observed value of the cosmological constant at\nthe end of our analysis.\nIn this paper we first briefly summarize the braneworld model with non zero brane cosmological constants as found in [2]. The detailed analysis of the stability mechanism has\n3\n\n\fbeen presented in the next section. Finally we conclude with the summary of our results\nand discuss some open issues.\n\nII.\n\nMODEL\n\nIn the Randall and Sundrum [1] warped braneworld model the cosmological constant induced on the visible brane is zero which is not consistent with the present day observed small\npositive value of the cosmological constant. Moreover the consistent boundary condition requires that the tension of the visible TeV brane must be negative which in turn indicates\nan intrinsic instability. In an attempt to generalize this model it has been demonstrated in\n[2] that the condition of zero cosmological constant on the brane may be relaxed for a more\ngeneral warp factor which includes branes with non-zero cosmological constant. Another\nimportant aspect of the model [2] is that in some circumstances the visible brane tension\nmay become positive also. Let us now discuss the model briefly. In this model the warped\ngeometry has been obtained by considering a constant curvature brane space-time. General\nform of the warped metric for a five dimensional space-time is given by,\nds2 = e\u22122A(y) g\u03bc\u03bd dx\u03bc dx\u03bd + dy 2\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere g\u03bc\u03bd stands for four dimensional curved brane. There are two branes located at orbifold\nfixed points y = 0 and y = r\u03c0 where r corresponds to the modulus associated with the extra\ndimension. The bulk consists of a negative cosmological constant, \u039b. A scalar mass on the\nq\nm\n\u039b\n\u2212A(kr\u03c0)\n\u2212n\nvisible brane gets warped through the warp factor e\n= m0 = 10 where, k = \u2212 12M\n3\n\u223c Planck Mass and 'n', the warp factor index is set to 16 to achieve the desired warping\n\nfrom Planck to TeV scale. The magnitude of the induced cosmological constant on the\nbrane in this case is non-vanishing in general and is given by = 10\u2212N (in Planck units).\nFor a negative brane cosmological constant, N has minimum value given by Nmin = 2n\nleading to an upper bound on the magnitude of the cosmological constant ( depending on\nthe choice of the warp factor index n. There is no such upper bound for the induced positive\ncosmological constant on the brane. For brane cosmological constant, \u03a9 > 0 and \u03a9 < 0, the\nbrane metric g\u03bc\u03bd may correspond to different space-time geometry such as dS-Schwarzschild\nand AdS-Schwarzschild spacetimes respectively.\n\n4\n\n\fA.\n\nAdS Brane :\n\nFor the negative value of the cosmological constant \u03a9 on the visible brane if one redefines\n\u03c9 2 \u2261 \u2212\u03a9/3k 2 \u2265 0 then the solution of the warp factor can be written as :\n\u0010 \u03c9\n\u0011\ne\u2212A = \u03c9 cosh ln\n+ ky\n(2.2)\nc1\n\u221a\nwhere c1 = 1 + 1 \u2212 \u03c9 2 for which the warp factor is normalized to unity at y = 0. One can\nshow that real solution for the warp factor exists if and only if \u03c9 2 \u2264 10\u22122n . This leads to an\nupper bound for the magnitude of the cosmological constant as Nmin = 2n. So, for n = 16 ,\nN is found to be 10\u221232 . For N = Nmin , one obtains a degenerate solution kr\u03c0 = n ln 10+ln 2.\nFor N \u2212 2n >> 1, the solutions obtained in this case, are\n1\nkr1 \u03c0 = n ln 10 + 10\u2212(N \u22122n)\n4\nkr2 \u03c0 = (N \u2212 n) ln 10 + ln 4\n\n(2.3)\n\nAs an example, to have a solution of the gauge hierarchy problem with the small non zero\nvalue of the brane cosmological constant we consider n = 16 and N = 124 for which the\nvalues in the above equation become\nk\u03c0r1 \u2243 36.84 + 10\u221293\nk\u03c0r2 = 250.07\n\n(2.4)\n\nNote that for x = n ln 10 and N = \u221e, the RS value can be recovered. At kr\u03c0 =\n\nn ln 10 + ln 2 and N = 2n, \u03c9 2 reaches to its maximum value. Beyond this the magnitude\n\nof \u03c9 2 starts to decrease again. One can also obtain the tension of the visible brane for the\nabove two solutions. When N = Nmin = 2n, the visible brane tension is zero. For r = r1 it\nis negative while for r = r2 it is positive.\n\nB.\n\ndS Brane :\n\nFor the induced brane cosmological constant \u03a9 > 0 the warp factor turns out to be :\n\u0011\n\u0010 c\n2\n\u2212A\n(2.5)\ne = \u03c9 sinh ln \u2212 ky ,\n\u03c9\n\u221a\nwhere \u03c9 2 \u2261 \u03a9/3k 2 and c2 = 1 + 1 + \u03c9 2 . In this case there is no bound on the value of\n\u03c9 2 , and the (positive) cosmological constant can be of arbitrary magnitude. Also, there is\n5\n\n\fa single solution of kr\u03c0 whose precise value will depend on \u03c9 2 and n. The brane tension is\nnegative for the entire range of values of the positive cosmological constant. In Fig.(1) it\nhas been shown how the value of \u03c9 2 is related to the modulus which solves the hierarchy\nproblem.\nMoreover it has been shown in [2] that if one wants to resolve the fine tuning problem in\nconnection with Higgs mass without introducing any intermediate scale through the modulus\nr ( i.e keeping it close to Planck length) or the parameter k ( keeping it close to Planck mass)\nthen the cosmological constant must be tuned to a very tiny value. Therefore the issues of\ngauge hierarchy problem and the cosmological constant problem are intimately related to\neach other. An interesting outcome of this generalised RS model has been found in the\ncontext of localization of fermions on the Tev brane [3]. It has been shown that although\nthe generalised RS model allows different values of kr for different values of the cosmological\nconstant ( both in dS and AdS region in the figure above ) for the resolution of the hierarchy\nproblem but the simultaneous requirement of fermion localization can be achieved only for\nvanishingly small cosmological constant i.e. when the warp factor is close to that obtained\nin the original RS model.\nWith this generalized RS braneworld model we now explore the mechanism of stabilizing\nthe modulus r to a desired value ( which of course depend on the value the cosmological\nconstant \u03c9 ) so that the desired Planck to TeV scale warping can be achieved.\n\nIII.\n\nSTABILITY MECHANISM\n\nTo stabilize the modulus r we adopt the method proposed by Goldberger and Wise [4]\nin the context of the original RS model. Let us consider a scalar field, \u03a6 in the bulk with\nquartic interactions localized in the visible (y = r\u03c0) and Planck (y = 0) brane for which the\nbulk action turns out to be :\nZ\nZ r\u03c0\n1\n4\ndx\ndy(GAB \u2202A \u03a6\u2202B \u03a6 \u2212 m2 \u03a62 ) + Sh \u03b4(y) + Sv \u03b4(y \u2212 r\u03c0)\nS=\n2\n0\n\n(3.1)\n\nwhere GAB with A, B = \u03bc, y is given by the metric (2.1) and the interaction terms on\n\n6\n\n\f-N\n-32\nB\n\n-32.5\n\n-33.5\n\nDS\n\nADS\n\nI\n\nII\n\nIII\n\n-34.5\nA\n36.5\n\n37.5\n\n38.5\n\n39.5\n\n40\n\nx\n\nFIG. 1: Graph of N versus x = kr\u03c0 = 36 \u2212 40, for n = 16 and for both positive and negative\nbrane cosmological constant.

It has been discussed in the previous section that to resolve the gauge hierarchy\nproblem without introducing any intermediate scale, the brane cosmological constant must\nbe tuned to a very small value. Moreover the present observed value of the cosmological\nconstant is also extremely tiny. We therefore consider small \u03c9 limit to solve the scalar field\nequation.\nIn this case the warp factor in (2.2) takes the following perturbative form\ne\u22124A(y) = e\u22124ky + \u03c9 2 e\u22122ky\n7\n\n(3.5)\n\n\fWith the above warp factor the scalar field equation away from the brane locations (i.e.\ninside the bulk) reduces to the following form:\n\u2202y2 \u03a6 \u2212 4k\u2202y \u03a6 + 2k\u03c9 2 e2ky + m2 \u03a6 = 0\n\n(3.6)\n\nSolving the above equation we obtain the solution for the scalar field as,\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u03a6(y) = e2ky Ae\u03bdky + Be\u2212\u03bdky\n\u0013\u03bd \u0012\n\u0013\u03bd \u0012\n\u0015\n\u0014 \u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03c92\n\u03bd + 2 (\u03bd+4)ky\n\u2212\u03bd + 2 (\u2212\u03bd+4)ky\n\u03c9\n\u03c9\n\u2212\n(3.7)\n\u00c3 \u221a\ne\n+ B\u0303 \u221a\ne\n2\n\u03bd +1\n\u2212\u03bd + 1\n2\n2\np\nwhere \u03bd = 4 + m2 /k 2 .\n\u0010 \u0011\u03bd\n\u0010 \u0011\u03bd\nIn the above solution we have defined A = \u00c3 \u221a\u03c92\nand B = B\u0303 \u221a\u03c92\nwhere \u00c3 and B\u0303\nare arbitrary constants. The constants can be evaluated by using the appropriate boundary\nconditions at the locations of the branes.\nAn effective potential (Vef f ) for the modulus r can now be obtained by putting the above\nsolution (3.7) back into the scalar field action and integrating the entire scalar field action\n(3.1) over the extra dimension [4]. This yields an effective modulus potential as,\nVef f = kA2 (\u03bd + 2)(e2\u03bdkr\u03c0 \u2212 1) + kB 2 (2 \u2212 \u03bd)(e\u22122\u03bdkr\u03c0 \u2212 1)\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03bd +2\n2\n2\n(1 \u2212 e(2\u03bd+2)kr\u03c0 )\n+ k\u03c9 [2A\n\u03bd +1\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03bd\n2\u2212\u03bd\n2\n(1 \u2212 e(2\u22122\u03bd)kr\u03c0 ) + AB\n(e2kr\u03c0 \u2212 1)]\n+ 2B\n1\u2212\u03bd\n1 \u2212 \u03bd2\n+ \u03bbv e\u22124A\u03c0 (\u03a6(\u03c0)2 \u2212 vv2 ) + \u03bbh (\u03a6(0)2 \u2212 vh2 )\n\n(3.8)\n\nWe now calculate the unknown coefficients A and B. Rather than solving the equations in\ngeneral (i.e. putting the solution back in the action and matching the delta functions ) we\nconsider the simplified case where the parameters \u03bbv and \u03bbh are large [4]. It is seen from the\nexpression (3.8) that in this limit it is energetically favorable to have \u03a6(0) = vh and \u03a6(r\u03c0)\n= vv .

We know for \u03c9 = 0 ( i.e. RS case ), a\nsuitable non-hierarchical choice for (vh /vv yields a stable value of kr which is same as that\nproposed by Randall and sundrum to resolve the gauge hierarchy problem. However From\nthe figure (1), it can be seen that as we move into the Anti-de-Sitter region from \u03c9 2 = 0\n( i.e. RS case ) by increasing the magnitude of \u03c9 2 slightly , the required value of kr (\nto resolve the gauge hierarchy problem) increases from RS value. On the other hand the\ncorresponding stabilized value of kr decreases with increase in \u03c9 2 , as has been shown in\n(3.18). This opposite behavior clearly indicates that to achieve modulus stabilization and\nresolution of gauge hierarchy problem simultaneously the most favored value of the brane\ncosmological constant \u03c9 = 0 which was proposed in the original model.\nThe entire stability analysis done so far is based on the AdS brane background. If one\nperforms the same study with dS brane warp factor given in (2.5) we end up with the\nconditions,\n4(vv \u2212 vh e\u2212\u01ebkr\u03c0 ) +\n\n\u03c9 2 2kr\u03c0\ne\n(4vv \u2212 11vh e\u2212\u01ebkr\u03c0 ) = 0.\n3\n\n(3.19)\n\nwith the stable modulus value as,\nkr =\n\n7\u03c9 2\n1\nln(vh /vv ) +\n(vh /vv )2/\u01eb\n\u01eb\u03c0\n12\u01eb\u03c0\n\n(3.20)\n\nOnce again the figure(1) and (3.20)reveals that while the required value of kr which resolves\nthe gauge hierarchy problem, decreases with increase in the value of positive brane cosmological constant \u03c9 2 , the corresponding stabilized value increases with \u03c9 2 . Thus once again\nRS assumption of \u03c9 2 = 0 turns out to be a most favored solution.\n\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe now summarize the results obtained in this work. We have shown that for a generalized RS model with a cosmological constant on the brane, the modulus stabilization\ncondition explicitly depends on the brane cosmological constant. We have obtained this\ncondition both for positive and negative values of the brane cosmological constant. It turns\n10\n\n\fout that if one increases the magnitude of \u03c9 2 from zero the stabilized value of kr decreases\n(increases) for AdS (dS) brane. Whereas the value of kr which solves the hierarchy problem\nincreases (decreases) with the increase in value of the cosmological constant. It implies that\nif one starts from \u03c9 2 \u223c 0, then the variation of kr with \u03c9 2 for the requirement modulus\nstabilization and that for the gauge hierarchy resolution are opposite. This establishes that\nwhile the generalized RS model indeed predicts that for every value of brane cosmological\nconstant we have a corresponding value of kr which can resolve the problem of gauge hierarchy, the zero value of the brane cosmological constant, as assumed in the original RS\nmodel is most favored if one imposes in addition the condition of modulus stabilization. The\npresent small value of \u03c9 2 \u223c 10\u2212124 yields the stabilized value of kr for the de-Sitter case ( see\nequ. 3.20), which is very close to the corresponding value of kr needed to resolve the gauge\nhierarchy problem ( see Figure 1 ). However for larger value of \u03c9 2 the stabilized value of kr\nis further away from that required to resolve the gauge hierarchy problem. Thus a non-zero\ncosmological constant on the brane can consistently address both the gauge hierarchy as\nwell as the modulus stabilization problem only when it's value is extremely tiny. This is in\nagreement with the anthropic explanation [10] in favour of a small cosmological constant of\nour universe.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nJM acknowledges Council For Scientific and Industrial Research, Govt.
