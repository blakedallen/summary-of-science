INTRODUCTION\n\nGalaxy formation is one of the most fundamental problems in astrophysics. To understand how galaxies form, we\nneed to unravel how stars form from the primordial gas and\nhow the first stars interact with their surrounding environments. As there are no heavy elements in the early universe, the thermodynamic behavior of the gas is essentially\ncontrolled by H2 cooling, and the first Population III stars\nare expected to be very massive (e.g., Abel, Bryan, & Norman\n2002; Bromm, Coppi, & Larson 2002). While much progress\nhas been made in finding large populations of galaxies at high\n(z \u2265 3) redshifts (e.g., Steidel et al. 1996), truly young galaxies in the process of forming remain elusive in the distant universe. The spectra of those far-away galaxies generally indicate the presence of a substantial amount of heavy elements,\nimplying previous star formation and metal enrichment. Instead of focussing on high-redshift galaxies, another approach\nis to study massive star formation and its interaction with the\nambient interstellar medium (ISM) in a class of nearby metaldeficient dwarf galaxies called Blue Compact Dwarf (BCD)\ngalaxies, some of which are thought to be undergoing their\nfirst episode of star formation.\nThe formation of the hot gas phase is one of the most fundamental processes operating in the early period of galaxy formation and it has important consequences on the subsequent\ndynamical state and photometric evolution of the dwarf system. The generation of large amounts of hot (a few \u00d7106 K),\nrarefied gas is the result of injection of energy and momentum\ninto the cold ambient ISM by stellar winds from massive stars\nand supernovae. The starburst activity which fuels the ISM of\nyoung dwarf galaxies with hot X-ray emitting gas lasts about\n1 Astronomy Department, University of Virginia, P.O.

It is then followed by a long (> 1\u20132 Gyr)\nquiescent period of passive photometric evolution. Moreover,\nexpansion of the hot ISM on scales comparable to the galactic scale length can lead to a rapid funneling of gaseous mass\ninto the cold gaseous halo. The details of such a process are\nexpected to be sensitively related to the energy injection rate\ninto the ISM and the geometry and robustness of the ambient\ncold gaseous medium (De Young & Heckman 1994). Extensive mass loss can lead to an expansion of the stellar population and to a morphological evolution of the dwarf galaxy\n(for example a dwarf irregular galaxy may lose its gas and\nevolve into a dwarf elliptical) or even disrupt the system entirely (Hills 1980; Yoshii & Arimoto 1987).\nHere we present a study at X-ray energies of the three most\nmetal-deficient star-forming dwarf galaxies known in the\nlocal universe, the BCDs SBS 0335\u2212052 (Thuan & Izotov\n1997; Izotov et al. 1997; Thuan, Izotov, & Lipovetsky\n1997, hereafter TIL), SBS 0335\u2212052W (Lipovetsky et al.\n1999), and I Zw 18 (see Papaderos et al. 2002,\nHunt, Thuan, & Izotov 2003a, and references therein).\nX-ray emission provides an efficient and direct probe of the\nhot gas component, and can provide valuable constraints on\nthe nature of the X-ray binary population. The number of\nhigh mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs) put limits on the BCD's\nsupernova rate while the number of low mass X-ray binaries\n(LMXBs) contrains the total mass of forming stars. The\nrelative proximity of these three BCDs [D = 54.3 Mpc for\nSBS 0335\u2212052 and SBS 0335\u2212052W (TIL); D = 12.6 Mpc\nfor I Zw 18 (\u00d6stlin 2000)] , their extremely low metallicities\n[0.025Z\u2299 for SBS 0335\u2212052 (Izotov et al. 1999), 0.020Z\u2299\nfor SBS 0335\u2212052W (Lipovetsky et al. 1999), and 0.020Z\u2299\nfor I Zw 18 (Izotov et al. 1999)], and high neutral gas\ncontent (see Pustilnik et al. 2001 for SBS 0335\u2212052 and\nSBS 0335\u2212052W and van Zee et al. 1998 for I Zw 18)\nmake them the best local approximations to primordial\nyoung galaxies. Their relatively bright apparent magnitudes\n(mB = 17.0 mag for SBS 0335\u2212052, mB = 19.4 mag for\nSBS 0335\u2212052W and mB = 15.8 mag for I Zw 18) make\nthem much easier to study than the very faint and small\n\n\f2\n\nTHUAN ET AL.\n\nbuilding-block dwarf galaxies at high-redshift. HI VLA\nmapping (Pustilnik et al. 2001) shows SBS 0335\u2212052 and\nSBS 0335\u2212052W to be embedded in a common very large\nHI envelope with an overall size of \u223c 66\u00d722 kpc. There\nare two prominent HI peaks separated in the east-west\ndirection by 22 kpc (84\u2032\u2032 ). The eastern peak is associated\nwith SBS 0335\u2212052, while the western peak is about a factor\nof 1.3 brighter in the HI line and is associated with the fainter\nSBS 0335\u2212052W. Likewise, HI VLA mapping of I Zw 18\nby van Zee et al. (1998) shows that it is also embedded in an\nextended HI envelope.\nOptical HST imaging shows that nearly all star formation\nin SBS 0335\u2212052 occurs in six very blue super-star clusters\n(SSCs) with absolute V luminosities between -11.7 and -14.7\nmag, and surface brightnesses & 100 times those of clusters\nand associations in normal HII regions. The SSCs are confined to a region of about 520 pc in diameter (TIL). There is\na systematic color gradient from the brightest and bluest SSC\nat one end to the faintest and reddest SSC at the other end.\nSuch behavior can be attributed partly to variable dust extinction. Dust is clearly present, even in such a metal-poor environment, as evidenced by the strong mid-infrared emission\nof SBS 0335\u2212052 (Thuan, Savage, & Madden 1999). However, most of the color gradient is due to a systematic aging\nof the SSCs resulting from sequential propagating star formation (with a velocity \u2264 20 km s\u22121 ) from the reddest and oldest\nSSC to the bluest and youngest one (Papaderos et al. 1998) .\nFrom the V \u2212 I colors and the models of Leitherer & Heckman\n(1995), the age of the youngest SSC is \u223c 4 Myr while that\nof the oldest SSC is \u223c 30 Myr. On larger scales, the light\nof SBS 0335\u2212052 is dominated by a patchy and filamentary\nvery blue low surface brightness (LSB) emission. Spectroscopic studies (Izotov et al. 1997) have revealed that ionized\ngas contributes \u223c 30% of the emission from the LSB component, out to scales of \u223c 3 kpc. The remaining \u223c 70% of\nthe light comes from an underlying stellar population which\nPapaderos et al. (1998) have shown is not older than \u223c 500\nMyr. A striking signature of the collective action of massive\nstars and SNe on the ISM of SBS 0335\u2212052 is a large supershell with radius \u223c 380 pc to the North of the SSCs. TIL\nestimate the star formation rate in SBS 0335\u2212052 from its H\u03b1\nluminosity to be \u223c 0.4 M\u2299 yr\u22121 .\nSBS 0335\u2212052W has been studied in detail by\nLipovetsky et al. (1999).\nIt has the same redshift as\nSBS 0335\u2212052 and consists of at least three stellar clusters. It\nhas also a very low metallicity of \u223c 2% solar and is about 2.4\nmagnitudes fainter than SBS 0335\u2212052. Its very blue R \u2212 I\ncolors also suggest a very young age of less than \u223c 500 Myr.\nI Zw 18 is composed of two bright knots of star formation separated by 5\u2032\u2032 and referred to as the brighter northwest\n(NW) and fainter southeast (SE) components (Papaderos et al.\n2002). Star formation proceeds differently in I Zw 18 as compared to SBS 0335\u2212052. There are no SSCs in I Zw 18 and\nthe derived SFR is one order of magnitude smaller (\u223c 0.04\nM\u2299 yr\u22121 ) than in SBS 0335\u2212052. Papaderos et al. (2002) and\nHunt, Thuan, & Izotov (2003a), using deep optical and nearinfrared imaging, have put an upper limit of \u223c 500 Myr for\nthe age of I Zw 18.\nIn \u00a72 we describe the properties of the X-ray sources and\ntheir optical properties. In \u00a73 we summarize our findings and\ndiscuss the X-ray properties of SBS 0335\u2212052 and I Zw 18\nin the broader context of star formation in a low-metallicity\nenvironment.\n\n2.

The field of view of 16.\u2032 9 \u00d7 16.\u2032 9 was large enough to\ninclude also SBS 0335\u2212052W. Events were telemetered in\nVery Faint mode, and the CCD temperature was \u2212120\u25e6 C. To\ncompare the X-ray properties of SBS 0335\u2212052 with those\nof another extremely metal-deficient BCD, we have retrieved\nfrom the Chandra archive the data for the BCD I Zw 18. This\ngalaxy was observed on 2000 February 8 (P.I: D.J. Bomans)\nwith ACIS-S (chips 235678 on, 8.\u2032 5 \u00d7 8.\u2032 5 per chip). Events\nwere telemetered in Faint mode, and the CCD temperature\nwas \u2212120\u25e6 C. The ACIS pixel size is 0.\u2032\u2032 492 while the halfenergy radius of an on-axis point source is \u2248 0.\u2032\u2032 42.\nAnalysis was done using primarily the CIAO V2.3 software provided by the Chandra X-ray Center (CXC), but\nalso with FTOOLS and custom software. We removed the\n0.\u2032\u2032 5 pixel randomization, cleaned the ACIS background using Very Faint mode screening for SBS 0335\u2212052, performed\nstandard ASCA grade selection, and excluded bad pixels and\ncolumns. The total net exposure times were 61,042 s for\nSBS 0335\u2212052 and 40,776 s for I Zw 18. The average quiescent background rates for SBS 0335\u2212052 and I Zw 18 were\nfound to be 0.3 and 0.96 counts s\u22121 per chip, respectively,\nin good agreement with ACIS-I and ACIS-S calibration measurements. The observation of SBS 0335\u2212052 contained four\nbackground \"flares\", the intensity of each being about three\ntimes the quiescent level and lasting for 5\u201310% of the total\nexposure. The observation of I Zw 18 contained one flare\nabout ten times the quiescent level lasting for 20% of the total\nexposure 5 . None of the flares were strong enough to warrant removal. The resulting average background level is thus\n\u2248 0.02 counts pixel\u22121 and \u2248 0.06 counts pixel\u22121 , respectively.\n2.2. Astrometry of optical and X-ray images\n\nTo compare the X-ray emission with the optical emission, we have overlayed the X-ray contours over the V band (F569W) HST WFPC2 image of SBS 0335\u2212052 obtained by TIL and the V -band (F555W) HST WFPC2 image\nof I Zw 18 retrieved from the archives and reprocessed by\nPapaderos et al. (2002). As SBS 0335\u2212052W does not lie\nwithin the field of view of any HST image, we have used\nfor optical comparison the CCD B-band image obtained by\nPapaderos et al. (1998) with the 2.2 m Calar Alto telescope.\nThe Calar Alto image has a large field of view (\u223c 17\u2032 \u00d7 17\u2032 ),\nand contains enough stars for aligning the HST and X-ray\nimages to the same astrometric reference frame. A similar\nalignment was performed for I Zw 18 using the CCD B-band\nimage obtained by Papaderos et al. (2002), also with the 2.2\nm Calar Alto telescope. To align the optical images, sources\nwere first extracted from the Calar Alto images using Sextractor (v2.2.1; Bertin & Arnouts 1996). Optical sources from the\nCalar Alto images were matched to the GSC2.2 catalog for\nabsolute astrometric alignment, giving a coincidence of 28\nsources within a 3\u03c3 radius of 0.\u2032\u2032 57 and a rms scatter of 0.\u2032\u2032 25\nfor SBS 0335\u2212052, and 25 sources within a 3\u03c3 radius of 0.\u2032\u2032 62\nand a rms scatter of 0.\u2032\u2032 23 for I Zw 18. In the same manner,\noptical sources from the Calar Alto image were used to align\nthe HST images (TIL; Papaderos et al. 2002) to the same ref5\n\nSee http://cxc.harvard.edu/contrib/maxim/bg/index.html\n\n\fCHANDRA OBSERVATIONS OF SBS 0335\u2212052, SBS 0335\u2212052W, AND I ZW 18\n\n3\n\nF IG . 1.- X-ray contours overlaid on a HST WFPC2 F569W image (TIL) of SBS 0335\u2212052 (left), a B-band Calar Alto image (Papaderos et al. 1998) of\nSBS 0335\u2212052W(middle) and a HST WFPC2 F555W image (Papaderos et al. 2002) of I Zw 18 (right).\n\nerence frame; 51 sources were matched within a 0.\u2032\u2032 82 radius\nand a rms scatter of 0.\u2032\u2032 31 for SBS 0335\u2212052, while 21 sources\nwere matched within a 0.\u2032\u2032 49 radius and a rms scatter of 0.\u2032\u2032 19\nfor I Zw 18.\nTo align the Chandra image, we first extracted the X-ray\nsources using the CIAO wavelet algorithm WAVDETECT on\nthe 0.5-8.0 keV images with a probability threshold of 10\u22127\n(Freeman et al. 2002), which is equivalent to the detection of\napproximately one false source over the entire ACIS array.\nEighty sources were detected in total in the SBS 0335\u2212052\nfield. Positions and counts for the sources were determined\nusing fixed circular apertures with 95% encircled energy radii\n(based on point spread functions (PSF) derived from MKPSF\nand the PSF library). Sixty-four sources lie within the region\nimaged by Papaderos et al. (1998) around SBS 0335\u2212052, of\nwhich 18 X-ray sources have plausible optical counterparts\nwithin a 3\u03c3 radius of 0.\u2032\u2032 9, including both SBS 0335\u2212052 and\nSBS 0335\u2212052W. Less than 2 false matches are expected.\nAligning the X-ray image to the optical astrometric reference\nframe based on these SBS 0335\u2212052 X-ray/optical matches,\nwe find that the astrometric accuracy of the X-ray positions\nhas a rms scatter of 0.\u2032\u2032 42. Likewise, 16 sources lie within the\nregion imaged by Papaderos et al. (2002) around I Zw 18, but\nonly four X-ray sources have plausible optical counterparts\nwithin a 3\u03c3 radius of 1.\u2032\u2032 7, including I Zw 18. This paucity\nof matches is likely due to the relatively shallow depth of the\nB-band Calar Alto image. Less than 1 false match is expected.\nAligning the X-ray image to the optical astrometric reference\nframe based on these I Zw 18 X-ray/optical matches, we find\nthat the astrometric accuracy of the X-ray positions has a rms\nscatter of 0.\u2032\u2032 55.\n2.3. X-ray Analysis\n\nBased on our astrometric solutions, we present X-ray contours of SBS 0335\u2212052, SBS 0335\u2212052W, and I Zw 18 in\nFigure 1, overlaid on optical images. SBS 0335\u2212052 consists\nof a faint X-ray point source (29 counts) lying \u22480.\u2032\u2032 3 north of\nSSC 2. We follow here the SSC numbering scheme of TIL.\nBecause the X-ray position is no more accurate than 0.\u2032\u2032 42,\nthe data is consistent with the X-ray source being physically\nassociated with SSC 2. The elongated shapes of the faint Xray contours to the north suggest that there may also be X-ray\nemission associated with SSC 3 and the pair of SSC 4 and 5.\nThere is also a very faint X-ray source to the northeast which\nappears to be associated with the supernova cavity seen in the\noptical image (TIL). Excluding the source near SSC 2, the\n\ntotal X-ray emission of the fainter features is .23 counts (Table 1), making it virtually impossible to distinguish between\npoint-like and truly extended emission.\nAlthough SBS 0335\u2212052W is 2.4 mag fainter in B than\nSBS 0335\u2212052, it is 2.8 times brighter in the X-ray. It consists of two faint X-ray point sources. The fainter one appears\nto be spatially coincident with the brightest of the two optical\nclusters in SBS 0335\u2212052W. The brighter X-ray source lies\n\u2248 1.\u2032\u2032 8 to the northeast and does not appear to have an optical\ncounterpart.\nI Zw 18 is only 1.2 mag brighter in B than SBS 0335\u2212052,\nbut its X-ray flux is more than 10 times higher than that of\nSBS 0335\u2212052. It consists of a single X-ray point source\n(471 counts) and a very faint extended X-ray component (22\ncounts). The point source is spatially coincident with the\nbright NW component of I Zw 18. The faint extended component appears to lie along the main body of I Zw 18 with some\nX-ray emission centered on the northwest component and\nsome in between the northwest and southeast optical peaks.\nBomans & Weis (2002) in a preliminary reduction of the same\nChandra data also found the X-ray emission of I Zw 18 to be\ncomposed of a strong point source and fainter extended emission, although we fail to recover the SW and NE extensions\nthese authors claim to see.\nX-ray variability is an extremely useful method for constraining the size of the emitting region. Because Chandra records the position, energy, and time of all incoming\nphotons, we can use this information to search for shortterm variability over the duration of our observation. We\nsearched for variability from the different X-ray components\nof SBS 0335\u2212052, SBS 0335\u2212052W, and I Zw 18 using the\nKolomogrov-Smirnov (KS) test. While no significant variability was found, the limited statistics do not strongly constrain the temporal nature of the sources.\nX-ray spectra can provide information about the mechanisms by which the X-ray emission is generated. The X-ray\nspectra were analyzed using XSPEC (v11.2 Arnaud 1996).\nUnless stated otherwise, spectral parameter errors are for the\n90% confidence level, assuming one parameter of interest.\nThe X-ray fluxes and absorption-corrected luminosities for\nall sources were calculated from spectral fitting using XSPEC.\nImportantly, none of the sources of interest suffer from pileup.\nTo constrain the fit of the X-ray spectra, it is important\nto use accurate HI column densities for each of the objects.\nThe HI column density towards SBS 0335\u2212052 has been derived by (Thuan & Izotov 1997) through fitting the wings of\n\n\f4\n\nTHUAN ET AL.\nTABLE 1.

Column\n10: Comments.\n\nthe damped L\u03b1 profile in a HST/GHRS UV spectrum. They\nfound NHI = (7.0 \u00b1 0.5) \u00d7 1021 cm\u22122 . This is nearly 10 times\nlarger than the peak HI column density of 7.4\u00d71020 cm\u22122\nwhich (Pustilnik et al. 2001) found in their VLA HI map of\nSBS 0335\u2013052. This large difference can be undertood as\na beam-smearing effect in the VLA map. The synthesized\nVLA beam (20.\u2032\u2032 5 \u00d7 15.\u2032\u2032 0) is considerably larger than the\nGHRS aperture (2.\u2032\u2032 0 \u00d7 2.\u2032\u2032 0), and column densities in the direction of structures smaller than the VLA beam will be artificially diminished. Thus, for the X-ray point source associated\nwith SBS 0335\u2013052, the HI column density obtained from the\nspectrum through the small GHRS aperture is the appropriate one to use. No comparable HST/GHRS spectrum exists\nfor SBS 0335\u2212052W. The VLA map (Pustilnik et al. 2001)\nshows that the HI column density towards SBS 0335\u2212052W\nto be 1.35 larger as compared to SBS 0335\u2212052. For lack of\nbetter information, we have simply scaled the GHRS HI column density towards SBS 0335\u2212052 by that factor to obtain\nthe HI column density towards SBS 0335\u2212052W. However,\nwe should remember that, because of the large VLA beam,\nwe do not know the exact value of N(HI) in the inner 2\u2032\u2032 of\nSBS 0335\u2212052W, where the X-ray emission is located. For\nthe HI column density towards I Zw 18, we have adopted the\nvalue NHI = (3.5 \u00b1 0.5) \u00d7 1021 cm\u22122 derived by (Kunth et al.\n1994) in the same way as for SBS 0335\u2013052, by fitting\nthe wings of the damped L\u03b1 profile in a HST/GHRS spectrum of the NW component, obtained through a 2.\u2032\u2032 0 \u00d7 2.\u2032\u2032 0\naperture. This value is entirely consistent with the value of\n2.1\u00d71021 cm\u22122 derived by Vidal-Madjar (2000) from fitting\nthe Ly\u03b2 absorption profile, with that of (2.0\u00b10.5)\u00d71021 cm\u22122\nobtained by Lecavelier des Etangs et al. (2003) and that of\n21\n\u22122\n2.2+0.6\n\u22120.5 \u00d7 10 cm obtained by Aloisi et al. (2003) by fitting\nthe blue wing of the Ly\u03b2 line and the profiles of several other\nlines of the HI Lyman series. The last three determinations\nare based on FUSE spectra obtained through a 30.\u2032\u2032 0 \u00d7 30.\u2032\u2032 0\naperture. Brown et al. (2002) have obtained STIS data of I Zw\n\n18 at the very high spatial resolution of 0.\u2032\u2032 5. They discovered significant inhomogeneity in the HI gas, with a peak as\nhigh as NHI \u223c 2 \u00d7 1022 cm\u22122 . However, this is not the appropriate value to use here as this HI peak is associated with the\nSE component, while the X-ray source is associated with the\nNW component which (Kunth et al. 1994) observed. VLA\nHI maps of I Zw 18 have been obtained by van Zee et al.\n(1998). They also found a peak HI column density at the SE\ncomponent of \u223c 3 \u00d7 1021 cm\u22122 . Again, because the highest\nresolution map of van Zee et al. (1998) has a beam size of\n5.\u2032\u2032 2 \u00d7 4.\u2032\u2032 8, beam smearing effects have decreased the real HI\npeak column density by a factor of nearly 10.\nThe ACIS spectra of the sources in SBS 0335\u2212052,\nSBS 0335\u2212052W, and I Zw 18 were fit with two types of\nmodels, absorbed thermal plasma models (zwabs+raymond;\nRaymond & Smith 1977) and absorbed power-law models (zwabs+pow). Given the limited counting statistics,\nwe performed the spectral analysis using the unbinned,\nbackground-subtracted source spectra and the Cash statistic\n(Cash 1979), which is well suited to low-count sources (e.g.,\nNousek & Shue 1989). Note that we expect . 2 background\ncounts in the source aperture, so spurious residuals from spatially varying background should be negligible. One limitation of the Cash statistic is that it does not provide a reliable\nquality-of-fit criterion (like the \u03c72 statistic) to compare different models. Therefore, we established the quality of the spectral results via visual inspection using the binned spectrum.\nNone of the sources have enough counts to constrain strongly\nboth the column density and the temperature or photon index.\nIn our spectral fits using a thermal plasma model, we have\nassumed an abundance of Z = 0.025Z\u2299 for SBS 0335\u2212052,\nand Z = 0.02Z\u2299 for SBS 0335\u2212052W and I Zw 18, in accordance with the abundances determined spectroscopically\n(see Izotov et al. 1999 for SBS 0335\u2212052 and I Zw 18, and\nLipovetsky et al. 1999 for SBS 0335\u2212052W).\nThe spectrum of the point source in SBS 0335\u2212052 has only\n\n\fCHANDRA OBSERVATIONS OF SBS 0335\u2212052, SBS 0335\u2212052W, AND I ZW 18\n\u224829 counts and is not strongly constrained by either the absorbed power-law or thermal plasma models when the column\ndensity NH is left as a free parameter in the fit (see Table 1).\nIf we fix NH to the HI value of 7 \u00d7 1021 cm2 obtained from fitting the Ly\u03b1 profile (Thuan & Izotov 1997), we find that the\nspectrum is moderately soft, with best-fit values of the photon index \u0393 = 2.2+0.6\n\u22120.8 (\u0393 = \u03b1 + 1, where \u03b1 is the slope of the\npower-law fit ) or kT = 2.7+16.6\n\u22121.3 keV. These values are consistent with those of black-hole X-ray binaries (e.g., \u0393 \u223c 1.7\u2013\n2.2; Foschini et al. 2002; Roberts et al. 2003), but are not consistent with a hot gas component heated by supernovae which\nhas typically kT < 1 keV. The point source has an unabsorbed\nX-ray luminosity of (2.8\u20133.5)\u00d71039 erg s\u22121 . The spectrum\nand lack of variability do not provide further constraints on\nthe nature of this source.\nThe spectrum of the brighter component point source (#1)\nin SBS 0335\u2212052W is acceptably fit by both the absorbed\npower-law or thermal plasma models. The best fit param21\neters are NHI = (5.2+3.3\ncm\u22122 , \u0393 = 2.8+0.9\n\u22122.7 ) \u00d7 10\n\u22120.8 and NHI =\n+2.3\n21\n\u22122\n+2.2\n(3.1\u22121.9 ) \u00d7 10 cm , kT = 2.0\u22120.8 keV, respectively (see Table 1). The NH vs. \u0393 and NH vs. kT confidence contours for SBS 0335\u2212052W #1 are given in Figure 2, indicating the relative accuracy of the derived parameters. The\nsoft intrinsic spectrum is similar to that of the point source\nin SBS 0335\u2212052, and is not consistent with the typical\nhot gas component seen in other galaxies. The best fit values of NH in both models are higher than the beam-diluted\nNHI = 1.0 \u00d7 1021 cm\u22122 obtained from the VLA HI map. However, they are lower than the value of 9.5\u00d71021 cm\u22122 obtained from scaling the NHI obtained from the fit of the\ndamped L\u03b1 profile in SBS 0335\u2212052 by the ratio of radio\nHI column densities of 1.35 between SBS 0335\u2212052 and\nSBS 0335\u2212052W (Pustilnik et al. 2001). The point source in\nSBS 0335\u2212052W has an unabsorbed X-ray luminosity in the\nrange (5.2\u20138.5)\u00d71039 erg s\u22121 .\nThe spectrum of the fainter component point source (#2)\nin SBS 0335\u2212052W is also acceptably fit by both the absorbed power-law or thermal plasma models. The best fit\nparameters are NH = 2.3(< 7.1) \u00d7 1021 cm2 , \u0393 = 1.9+1.1\n\u22120.8 and\nNH = 1.3(< 3.0) \u00d7 1021 cm2 , kT = 5.4(> 1.9) keV, respectively\n(see Table 1). Although the column density is not well constrained, the upper limits are in good agreement with those\nfrom point source #1. The intrinsic spectrum of this source is\nthe hardest of the three discussed so far, but it is still relatively\nsoft. This point source has an unabsorbed X-ray luminosity in\nthe range (2.4\u20132.8)\u00d71039 erg s\u22121 .\nThe spectrum of I Zw 18 has much better photon statistics\nthan SBS 0335\u2212052, so we grouped the X-ray spectra in 20count bins and fit the data using \u03c72 . The absorbed power-law\nmodel provides a slightly better fit to the continuum than the\nabsorbed thermal plasma model, although both are formally\nacceptable. The best fit parameters are NH = (1.44+0.38\n\u22120.37 ) \u00d7\n+0.27\n21\n1021 cm\u22122 , \u0393 = 2.01+0.14\ncm\u22122 ,\n\u22120.16 and NH = (0.87\u22120.24 ) \u00d7 10\n+1.84\nkT = 4.06\u22121.19 keV, respectively (see Table 1). Interestingly,\nwe find large residuals below \u2248 1 keV, particularly around\n\u2248 0.65 keV, which is most likely caused by one or more emission lines. Bomans & Weis (2002) also found this line, accounting for about 3% of the total flux, which they attributed\nto the OVIII hydrogen-like emission line.\nOne way to account for this particular emission feature is an\nO enhancement in the X-ray gas. If we model the spectrum\nwith an absorbed thermal plasma model, varying the O abundance but keeping all other elements fixed to Z = 0.02Z\u2299 , we\n\n5\n\nfind an improvement over the simple thermal model fit at the\n99.99% confidence level (Figure 3). The best fit parameters\nare\n21\n+2.25\nNH = (0.94+0.35\ncm\u22122 , kT = 4.28\u22121.31\nkeV, Z O =\n\u22120.24 ) \u00d7 10\n+12.2 O\n7.0\u22124.3 Z\u2299 , (see Table 1).\nTo check for the possibility that \u03b1-elements other than O\nmay also be contributing to the shape of the X-ray spectrum,\nwe have also investigated a model where the abundances of\nthe \u03b1-elements Ne, Si, S and Ar vary in concert with the O\nabundance, but in such a way that the \u03b1-element-to-oxygen\nabundance ratios Ne/O, Si/O, S/O and Ar/O remain constant,\nequal to the values derived by Izotov & Thuan (1999) for lowmetallicity BCDs (see their Table 6). This model gives a\nworse fit to the X-ray spectrum. We conclude that the O abundance of the X-ray gas in the point source in I Zw 18 is likely\nto be enhanced by a factor of \u223c 350 with respect to the O\nabundance determined for the HII region gas, while the other\n\u03b1-elements have abundances that are consistent with no enrichment with respect to the abundances in the HII region.\nThe point source in I Zw 18 has an unabsorbed X-ray luminosity between 1.3\u20131.5\u00d71039 erg s\u22121 , a factor of 2\u20134 times\nsmaller than those found for SBS 0335\u2212052. In addition to\nthe point sources discussed previously, both SBS 0335\u2013052\nand I Zw 18 also show faint extended sources. The flux of\nthe extended source in SBS 0335\u2013052 is only about 10% of\nthe 0.5\u201310 keV flux of the point source, and that of the one\nin I Zw 18 is only about 2.7% of the flux of the point source\n(Table 1). The physical nature of these extended sources will\nbe discussed more in detail in the next section.\n3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nOur main findings are the following:\n1) X-ray emission is detected from both SBS 0335\u2212052\nand SBS 0335\u2212052W, and from I Zw 18. The 0.5\u201310.0 keV\nluminosities of the three BCDs are in the range 1.3\u20138.5 \u00d7\n1039 erg s\u22121 . They are dominated by point sources, although\nat the distances of these objects and with the limited statistics, it is difficult to rule out emission from a collection of\nfainter point or compact extended sources. If these sources\nare single objects, their luminosities would place them in the\nrange of the so-called ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs;\ne.g., Makishima et al. 2000)\nThe X-ray spectra of the point sources are well fitted\nby moderately soft power-laws, typical of X-ray emission\nfrom HMXBs or ULXs. The high X-ray luminosities of\nthese sources could be the result of the lower metallicities\nof the BCDs studied here (if accretion is via stellar winds),\nor beaming (as is thought to occur in some ULXs; e.g.,\nKing et al. 2001). The mean luminosity of galactic HMXBs is\n\u223c 5\u00d71036 erg s\u22121 (van Paradijs & McClintock 1995). The Xray sources in SBS 0335\u2212052, SBS 0335\u2212052W and I Zw 18\nare respectively about 600, 1300 and 300 times brighter. For\ncomparison, the HMXBs in the Magellanic Clouds (the LMC\nand the SMC have respectively 1/3 and 1/8 of the Sun's metallicity) are about 50 times brighter than their galactic counterparts (van Paradijs & McClintock 1995).\nIn the event of X-ray emission produced by accretion\nonto a compact object by a stellar wind, there are two\nmain reasons which may explain the boosting of the Xray luminosities of HMXBs in low-metallicity systems\n(van Paradijs & McClintock 1995). First, the X-ray heating\nof the gas as it falls toward a compact object depends strongly\non the atomic number Z, since the photoelectric cross-section\ngoes as Z4 . Thus in low-metallicity systems, the X-ray heat-\n\n\f6\n\nTHUAN ET AL.\n\nF IG . 2.- (Left) NH vs. \u0393 and (Right) NH vs. kT confidence contours for SBS 0335\u2212052 West #1.

Note the large\nresiduals around 0.65 keV suggesting the presence of an OVIII hydrogen-like emission line. (Right) Same spectrum, modeled with an absorbed thermal plasma\nO , which significantly improves the fit in the 0.65 keV region.\nof kT = 4.28 keV, NH = 9.4 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 , and an O abundance of Z O = 7.0Z\u2299\n\ning is less, resulting in a larger accretion rate because it is\nless impeded by heating. Second, the accretion rate dM/dt increases strongly as the stellar wind velocity v of an OB star\nas the orbit of the compact object decreases (dM/dt is proportional to v\u22124 ). It is known that the terminal wind velocity in\nlow-metallicity systems drops significantly. Thuan & Izotov\n(1997) have measured a terminal velocity of \u223c 500 km s\u22121\nfor SBS 0335\u2212052, as compared to 2000\u20134000 km s\u22121 for\nthe Galaxy and the LMC, and 1200\u20131500 km s\u22121 for the\nSMC. Thus the high X-ray luminosities of the sources in\nthe metal-deficient galaxies SBS 0335\u2212052, SBS 0335\u2013052W\nand I Zw 18 (i.e., LX > 1039 erg s\u22121 ) do not necessarily require\nextreme black hole masses.\nThe X-ray luminosities found here are higher than\nthe point-source luminosities observed in less metal-poor\ndwarf starburst dwarf galaxies such as NGC 3077 (Z\u2299 ,\nL0.3\u2212\u22128.0 keV \u2248 2\u20135 \u00d7 1038 , & 15% from point sources;\nOtt, Martin, & Walter 2003), IC 10 (Z\u2299 /4, L0.3\u2212\u22128.0 keV \u2248 2 \u00d7\n1038 , & 95% from a single point source; Bauer & Brandt\n2003), NGC 4449 (Z\u2299 /4, L0.3\u2212\u22128.0 keV \u2248 2 \u00d7 1039 , \u223c 60%\nfrom point sources; Summers et al. 2003) and NGC 1569\n(Z\u2299 /5, L0.3\u2212\u22126.0 keV \u2248 1 \u00d7 1039 , \u223c 30% from point sources;\nMartin, Kobulnicky, & Heckman 2002; Heike et al. 2003).\nThey are comparable to the point source luminosity in Holmberg II (Z\u2299 /10, L0.1\u2212\u221210.0 keV \u2248 1 \u00d7 1040, & 75% from a single\npoint source; Miyaji, Lehmann, & Hasinger 2001).\n\nInterestingly, Hunt et al. (2003b) have detected a nonthermal radio source associated with SSCs 1 and 2. Its flux\ndensity is \u223c 0.6 mJy at 5 GHz, corresponding to a nonthermal radio luminosity of \u223c 2 \u00d7 1020 W Hz\u22121 . Within the\nuncertainties in the X-ray and radio positions, the non-thermal\nradio source can be associated with the X-ray point source.\nHowever the nature of such a radio+X-ray emitting object is\nnot clear. While its X-ray luminosity is similar to that expected from a microquasar associated with a medium-mass\nblack hole, its radio luminosity is about a million times greater\nthan that observed in such objects (Mirabel & Rodr\u00edguez\n1999). It can also be that the X-ray and radio sources are\nphysically distinct objects, although they are both associated\nwith the massive starburst episode that gave birth to the SSCs.\nWe note also that the time scale for HMXB formation of\n3\u201310 Myr after the onset of the starburst is consistent with the\nages of 5 Myr or younger of SSCs 1 and 2 in SBS 0335\u2212052\n(Vanzi et al. 2000) and of \u223c 3 Myr of the NW component in\nI Zw 18 (Hunt, Thuan, & Izotov 2003a).\n2) In addition to the point source emission in SBS 0335\u2013\n052 and I Zw 18, there appears also to be faint extended diffuse X-ray emission from hot gas, hints of which can be seen\nin the smoothed X-ray contours of Figure 1, particularly in\nI Zw 18. This emission, if truly diffuse, can be understood\nin both BCDs as produced by the hot gas filling the cavity\nof a superbubble carved out in the ISM of the BCD by stel-\n\n\fCHANDRA OBSERVATIONS OF SBS 0335\u2212052, SBS 0335\u2212052W, AND I ZW 18\nlar winds and supernovae. Indeed, HST optical imaging by\nTIL shows a large superbubble cavity of radius \u223c 380 pc in\nSBS 0335\u2212052, northeast of SSC 3 (see their Figure 1), where\nthe diffuse X-ray emission appears to lie. Using equations\n2, 4 and 6 of Martin & Kennicut (1995), the X-ray luminosity LX of the superbubble is proportional to R1.65 n0.66 T 2.66 ,\nwhere R is the radius of the superbubble, n the ambient ISM\ndensity and T the gas temperature. Adopting R = 380 pc,\nn = 12 cm\u22123 and T = 7.6 \u00d7 106 K, the predicted LX is in\ngood agreement with the observed diffuse X-ray luminosity\nof 6.4 \u00d7 1038 ergs s\u22121 . As for I Zw 18, the diffuse X-ray\nemission lie between the NW and SE centers of star formation. HST optical imaging by Hunter & Thronson (1995) suggests the presence of a supernova cavity there of radius 120\npc (see their figure 3). With R = 120 pc, n = 12 cm\u22123 and\nT = 6.0 \u00d7 106 K, LX is equal to 5.3 \u00d7 1037 ergs s\u22121 , again in\ngood agreement with the observed diffuse X-ray luminosity\nin I Zw 18.\n3) The spectrum of I Zw 18 shows a strong emission line at\n\u223c 0.65 KeV, identified by Bomans & Weis (2002) to be a O\nVIII hydrogen-like line. The best spectral fit (Figure 3) gives\nan overabundance of oxygen by a factor of \u223c 7 with respect\nto the Sun and of \u223c 350 with respect to the other heavy elements. It is interesting that this line is so strong because FUSE\nobservations of the HI interstellar gas in I Zw 18 (Aloisi et al.\n2003; Lecavelier des Etangs et al. 2003) shows the ISM to be\nas or more metal-deficient than the HII gas, i.e. to be less than\n2% of the solar metallicity. The presence of a sizable amount\n\n7\n\nof oxygen in the X-ray spectrum of the point source is most\nlikely due to oxygen-enrichment by either a companion star\n(in the case of an X-ray binary) or undiluted supernova ejecta\n(in the case of hot gas).\nFurther progress in our understanding of the X-ray emission in SBS 0335\u2212052, SBS 0335\u2212052W and I Zw 18 will\nrequire substantially better photon statistics and higher spatial resolution. A long observation with XMM-Newton, or\nConstellation-X/XEUS in the future, would be able to provide\nbetter spectral and temporal constraints that might confirm the\nnature of the brightest point sources as true single compact objects or a collection of X-ray binaries and hot gas. However,\nsuch observations will not have the necessary spatial resolution for separating the different emission components seen by\nChandra. Spatially resolving these objects with good sensitivity is beyond the capability of Chandra and must await the\nlaunch of Generation-X or a similar high-resolution X-ray observatory.\nPutting our results in a cosmological context, we expect that\nthe X-ray emission from high-reshift primordial galaxies to\ncome mainly from very high luminosity HMXBs.\nTXT acknowledges the partial financial support of CXC\ngrant GO0-1149X.
