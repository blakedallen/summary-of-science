Introduction\nWe investigate the dynamics of a spherical rigid body rolling on a plane. The\ndistribution of mass is non-uniform, so that the centre of mass does not coincide\nwith the geometric centre. However, the line joining the mass centre and geometric\ncentre is assumed to be a principal axis. We denote the principal moments of inertia\nby I1 , I2 and I3 , and assume that I1 \u2264 I2 < I3 . The symmetric case, when I1 = I2 ,\nwas first studied by Routh [15], and in this case the body is called Routh's Sphere.\nThere are three constants of motion and the system is integrable. In the asymmetric\ncase, I1 6= I2 , the system is no longer integrable. We find that even a small degree of\nasymmetry has a dramatic effect on the motion of the body.\nThe equations of the symmetric loaded sphere are identical to those governing the\nmotion of the tippe-top, which has been studied extensively (see [7] for a comprehensive\nreference list). However, in the case of the tippe-top, the angular momentum about\nthe principal axis with maximum moment of inertia is large, and sliding friction plays\na key role. In the case under consideration here, we are interested in solutions where\nthe angular velocity remains moderate and there is pure rolling contact. There are\ntwo characteristic modes of behaviour: pure rocking motion in a vertical plane, and\npure circular rolling motion. The general motion has aspects of both these special\ncases, which leads us to name the body the rock'n'roller.\n\n\fPrecession and recession of the rock'n'roller\n\n2\n\nFigure 1. The physical rock'n'roller, constructed by slicing off a polar cap from\na standard bowling ball. The polar angle is \u0398 \u2248 53\u25e6 .\n\nThis investigation arose from the observation of the oscillations of a glass candle\nholder, spherical in form with an opening at the top. For a more systematic study, we\nconstructed a larger and more massive body by removing a polar cap from a bowling\nball to produce a truncated sphere (figure 1). As long as the tilting angle is such that\nthe geometric centre is vertically above the contact point, the dynamics are equivalent\nto those of a loaded sphere. It was found that when the ball was tilted over to an angle\nof about 130\u25e6 , it rocked back and forth but also precessed through an azimuthal angle\nthat alternately increased and decreased. This unexpected and surprising recession,\nor reversal of precession, demanded an explanation in terms of dynamics.\nWe will show that for a symmetric loaded sphere reversal of the precession is\nimpossible. This raises the question: what factor is missing from our dynamical\nmodel? We rule out sliding friction, since the motion is gentle with no evidence of\nslipping. Random perturbations, due to the imperfect shape of the ball or irregularities\nof the underlying surface, were not considered as a likely cause of the behaviour, as\nexperiments indicated that the recession was quite a robust feature of the motion.\nAlthough bowling balls are manufactured to high tolerence, and deviations from\nperfect sphericity must be very small, slight anomalies in the mass distribution are\nunavoidable. Moreover, the recesses in the physical body remaining from the finger\nholes introduce some asymmetry (figure 1). We were thus led to study the dynamics\nwhen the inertial symmetry I1 = I2 is broken. We find that even a minute deviation\nfrom symmetry changes the behaviour of the numerical solution profoundly.

We base our analysis on the existence of critical\nlines dividing the (QR , QJ ) plane into four dynamically disjoint zones. We prove\nthat recession implies the lack of conservation of Jellett's and Routh's quantities,\nby identifying individual reversals as crossings of the orbit (QR (t), QJ (t)) through the\ncritical lines. This leads to a method of defining initial conditions for which the system\nwill exhibit recession.\nThe rock'n'roller is one of a hierarchy of loaded spheres. For the most general\n\u2212\u2212\u2192\ncase, the vector OC from the mass centre O to the geometric centre C does not lie\non a principal axis, and all moments of inertia are distinct. This is called Chaplygin's\n\u2212\u2212\u2192\nTop [3]. For the rock'n'roller, the geometric centre lies on a principal axis and OC\nis parallel to k, the unit vector along the I3 -axis. Routh's Sphere is the special case\nof this with I1 = I2 and Chaplygin's Sphere the special case where the mass centre\nand geometric centre coincide. The hierarchy is illustrated in figure 2. For recent\ndiscussions, see [9, 5, 4, 10, 17, 2, 16]\nSee an animation of the rock'n'roller that exhibits precession and recession in\nhttp://mathsci.ucd.ie/~plynch/RnR/RnR_movie.gif. We produced this movie\nfrom a Mathematica simulation code of the equations in the asymmetric case I1 6= I2 ,\ncorresponding to the initial conditions described in Figure 8.\n\n\fPrecession and recession of the rock'n'roller\n\n4\n\nFigure 3. The intermediate coordinate frame used to study Routh's Sphere.\n\n2. Symmetric Body (I\uf731 = I\uf732 ): The Dynamical Equations\nWe consider a body, spherical in shape with unit mass and unit radius, whose mass\ndistribution is non-uniform but symmetric about some line through the centre. We\nassume that the centre of mass is off-set a distance a from the geometric centre and\nthat the moments of inertia perpendicular to and along the symmetry axis are I1 and\nI3 , with I1 (= I2 ) < I3 . All the parameters are determined once the angle of the polar\ncap that is removed is known (see Appendix \u00a7A.1). In an inertial frame of reference,\nthe equations governing the dynamics of the body are\ndv\n=F\n(1)\ndt\nwhere v is the velocity of the centre of mass in the absolute frame and F the total\nforce acting on the body; and\ndL\n=G\n(2)\ndt\nwhere L is the intrinsic angular momentum and G the total moment about the centre\nof mass.\nThe derivation in this section is similar to that in [19]. We consider a rotating\nframe of reference, with unit triad (i\u2032 , j \u2032 , k\u2032 ) whose origin moves with the centre of\nmass of the body. The vector k\u2032 is aligned with the axis of symmetry of the body\nand j \u2032 is in the same vertical plane as k\u2032 (see figure 3). Then i\u2032 is horizontal and\nperpendicular to the plane of the figure, pointing inward. We use primes for this\nintermediate frame to distinguish it from the body frame that will be introduced in\n\u00a74 below.\n\n\f5\n\nPrecession and recession of the rock'n'roller\nThe angular velocity of the body, expressed in the intermediate frame, is\n\u03c9 = \u03c91\u2032 i\u2032 + \u03c92\u2032 j \u2032 + \u03c93\u2032 k\u2032\n\nAlthough this frame is not fixed in the body, it forms a set of principal axes in the\nsymmetric case, I1 = I2 , and the angular momentum is given by\nL = I1 \u03c91\u2032 i\u2032 + I1 \u03c92\u2032 j \u2032 + I3 \u03c93\u2032 k\u2032 .\nWe denote the angular velocity of the frame itself by \u03a9 and note that\n\u03a9 = \u03b8\u0307i\u2032 + \u03c6\u0307K = \u03b8\u0307i\u2032 + s\u03c6\u0307j \u2032 + c\u03c6\u0307k\u2032 = (\u03a91 , \u03a92 , \u03a93 )\n\n(3)\n\nwhere s = sin \u03b8 and c = cos \u03b8 and K is a unit vertical vector. The Euler angles\n(\u03b8, \u03c6, \u03c8) are related to the components of angular velocity by\n\u03c91\u2032 = \u03b8\u0307 ,\n\n\u03c92\u2032 = s\u03c6\u0307 ,\n\n\u03c93\u2032 = c\u03c6\u0307 + \u03c8\u0307 .\n\n(4)\n\nDefinitions are standard, and may be found in [12, 18, 20]. For a list of the principal\nsymbols used in this study, see Table 1.\n2.1. Equations in the intermediate frame\nIn the moving frame, the equations (1) and (2) become\ndv\n+ \u03a9\u00d7v = F\ndt\n\n(5)\n\nand\ndL\n+ \u03a9\u00d7L = G\ndt\nExpanding these in components in the i\u2032 j \u2032 k\u2032 -frame, we get\n\n(6)\n\nv\u03071\u2032 + \u03a92 v3\u2032 \u2212 \u03a93 v2\u2032 = F1\nv\u03072\u2032 + \u03a93 v1\u2032 \u2212 \u03a91 v3\u2032 = F2\nv\u03073\u2032 + \u03a91 v2\u2032 \u2212 \u03a92 v1\u2032 = F3\n\n(7)\n\nfor momentum. The angular momentum equations become\nI1 \u03c9\u03071\u2032 + I3 \u03a92 \u03c93\u2032 \u2212 I1 \u03a93 \u03c92\u2032 = G1\nI2 \u03c9\u03072\u2032 + I1 \u03a93 \u03c91\u2032 \u2212 I3 \u03a91 \u03c93\u2032 = G2\nI3 \u03c9\u03073\u2032\n= G3\n\n(8)\n\nEqns. (7) and (8) are identical to (12.412) in [18] (with I1 = I2 ).\nThe forces acting on the body are gravity W = (0, \u2212gs, \u2212gc) and the force of\nreaction R = (R1 , R2 , R3 ):\nF =W +R\nDefining f = c \u2212 a, the vector from the point of contact P to the centre of mass\nO is r = (0, s, f ) (see figure 3). Then the total moment about O is given by\nG = \u2212r \u00d7 R. The constraint of no slipping at the contact point requires that the\nbody is instantaneously rotating about this point.

Special solutions\nPure Rocking. For pure rocking motion, with no change of azimuthal angle and no\nrotation about the axis of symmetry, we have \u03c6 = \u03c8 = 0 and so \u03c92\u2032 = \u03c93\u2032 = 0.

It follows immediately that\nP2 = P3 = 0 (see (A.2)). The requirement that \u03b8 = \u03b80 , constant, implies P1 = 0,\nwhich yields a relationship between \u03c92\u2032 and \u03c93\u2032 :\n\u03c93\u2032 =\n\n(I1 cot \u03b80 + mh0 f0 csc \u03b80 )\u03c92\u20322 \u2212 ga sin \u03b80\n(I3 + h0 )\u03c92\u2032\n\n(14)\n\nwhere f0 = cos \u03b80 \u2212 a and h0 = 1 \u2212 a cos \u03b80 are constants.

Constants of motion and general solution\nWe consider the case of a perfectly rough contact, with rolling motion. Given that\nthere are two symmetries in the problem, invariance under addition of arbitrary\nconstants to either \u03c6 or \u03c8, we might expect two invariants in addition to the total\nenergy. For general initial conditions, there are three constants of integration. They\nare the total energy, Jellett's constant and Routh's constant (see [7] for a complete\nderivation of these constants).\nThe kinetic energy is the sum of translational and rotational components:\nT = 21 [v1\u20322 + v2\u20322 + v3\u20322 ] + 12 [I1 \u03c91\u20322 + I2 \u03c92\u20322 + I3 \u03c93\u20322 ]\n\n\fPrecession and recession of the rock'n'roller\n\n8\n\nand the potential energy is\nV = ga(1 \u2212 cos \u03b8) .\nThen, since there is no dissipation, the total energy\nE =T +V .\n\n(15)\n\nis conserved. Jellett's constant is the scalar product of the angular momentum and\nthe vector joining the point of contact to the centre of mass:\nQJ = L * r = I1 s \u03c92\u2032 + I3 f \u03c93\u2032 ,\n\n(16)\n\nand Routh's constant, more difficult to interpret physically, is\n\u03c93\u2032\n\u03c1\n\n(17)\n\nwhere, following [2], we define the measure\np\n\u03c1(\u03b8) = 1/ I3 + s2 + (I3 /I1 )f 2 .\n\n(18)\n\nQR =\n\nNotice that our definition of Routh's constant differs from the usual quadratic function\nof \u03c93\u2032 , in [15], [7] and elsewhere,\nAn interesting historical discussion of these constants may be found in [7]. Note\nthat the constancy of QR implies conservation of the sign of \u03c93\u2032 : since the measure \u03c1\nis positive definite, \u03c93\u2032 cannot pass through zero. For the tippe-top, this precludes the\ntipping phenomenon for the case of rolling motion.\nFrom the equations (11) determining the rates of change of the angles, we can\nsolve explicitly for \u03c6\u0307 and \u03c8\u0307 in terms of \u03b8 and Jellett's and Routh's constants:\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1\n\u03c6\u0307 = V\u03c6 (\u03b8, QJ , QR ) \u2261\nQJ \u2212 \u03c1f I3 QR ,\n(19)\nI1 s2\n\u0015\n\u0014\n1\n(20)\n\u03c8\u0307 = V\u03c8 (\u03b8, QJ , QR ) \u2261 \u2212 2 cQJ \u2212 \u03c1(cf I3 + I1 s2 )QR .\nI1 s\nSince QJ and QR are constants, the rates of change \u03c6\u0307 and \u03c8\u0307 are determined as singlevalued functions of the angle \u03b8. We will show in the next section that recession,\nor reversal of precession, implies in particular that \u03c6\u0307 and \u03c8\u0307 at a given angle \u03b8\nsystematically change their sign as time evolves. Therefore, in the symmetric case\nit is impossible to have recession for Routh's Sphere.\nWe can use the constants of motion to reduce the system to a single equation\nfor the tilting angle \u03b8. We use Routh's constant (17) to obtain \u03c93\u2032 (\u03b8). Then Jellett's\nconstant (16) gives \u03c92\u2032 (\u03b8). Finally, the energy (15) gives an expression for \u03c91\u2032 (\u03b8),\nyielding an equation of the form\n\u03b8\u03072 = F (\u03b8) ,\n\n(21)\n\nwhich may be integrated to obtain \u03b8(t). As a result, the system can be explicitly\nintegrated. However, we will not derive explicit analytical expressions for F (\u03b8) and\n\u03b8(t). The reader is referred to [7] for a more explicit treatment; see also [4], [16]. We\nsee that the evolution of \u03b8(t) obtained from (21) gives the rocking component of the\nmotion, while the evolution of \u03c6(t) and \u03c8(t), obtained from (19) and (20), give the\nrolling and spinning components of the motion.\n\n\fPrecession and recession of the rock'n'roller\n\n9\n\n2.4. Precession of the Rocking Motion\nThe generic motion of the symmetric body is quasi-periodic. On the one hand there\nis a period \u03c4 of the rocking motion, determined by the equation\nZ \u03b8X\nd\u03b8\np\n,\n\u03c4 =4\nF (\u03b8)\n\u03b8N\n\nwhere 0 \u2264 \u03b8N \u2264 \u03b8X \u2264 \u03c0, and \u03b8N and \u03b8X are the turning points where F (\u03b8N ) = 0 and\nF (\u03b8X ) = 0. On the other hand, the rolling motion during this period can be computed\nby integrating the rates of change of the angles \u03c6 and \u03c8 from (19) and (20):\nZ \u03c4\nZ \u03b8X\nV\u03c6 (\u03b8, QJ , QR )\np\n\u2206\u03c6 =\nV\u03c6 (\u03b8(t), QJ , QR ) dt = 4\nd\u03b8 ,\n(22)\nF (\u03b8)\n\u03b8N\n0\nwith an analogous formula for the angle \u2206\u03c8. Generically, \u2206\u03c6 is not commensurate\nwith 2\u03c0; this implies the quasi-periodicity of the precessing motion. As a consequence\nof quasi-periodicity, the projection of the trajectory onto the \u03b8-\u03c6-plane densely covers\na two-dimensional region.\nIn order to quantify the precession, we distinguish two angles, the full azimuthal\nangle \u03c6 and the visible angle \u03c6 (mod 2\u03c0), which is the angle that is seen by an\nobserver in the space frame. (We will occasionally use the visible half-angle \u03c6 (mod \u03c0),\nwhich gives more illustrative plots in the case of the (asymmetric) rock'n'roller).\nCorrespondingly, there will be two types of precession angle: \u2206\u03c6, the full precession\nangle defined by (22), and \u2206\u03c6 (mod 2\u03c0), the visible precession angle.\n2.5. Qualitative analysis of the precession. Criticality\nWe now estimate the precession angles \u2206\u03c6 and \u2206\u03c6 (mod 2\u03c0) from (22). Heuristically,\nthe main contribution comes from the regions near the turning points, where F (\u03b8) = 0.\nThe relative contributions at \u03b8N and \u03b8X will be determined by the magnitude and sign\nof V\u03c6 (\u03b8, QJ , QR ) at the turning points. It is therefore useful to study separately the\nbehaviour of V\u03c6 (\u03b8, QJ , QR ) for \u03b8 in each of the asymptotic regions \u03b8 \u2248 0 and \u03b8 \u2248 \u03c0:\n\u2022 Asymptotic region \u03b8 \u2248 0. A Laurent expansion of (19) gives\n\u0001\n1\nQJ \u2212 Qcrit\nV\u03c6 (\u03b8, QJ , QR )|\u03b8\u22480 =\nJ,0 + O(1) ,\n2\nI1 \u03b8\nwhere we define the 'critical Jellett quantity at \u03b8 = 0' as:\nQcrit\nJ,0 \u2261 \u03c10 (1 \u2212 a)I3 QR ,\np\nwith \u03c10 = 1/ I3 + (I3 /I1 )(1 \u2212 a)2 .\n\u2022 Asymptotic region \u03b8 \u2248 \u03c0. A Laurent expansion of (19) gives\n\u0001\n1\nV\u03c6 (\u03b8, QJ , QR )|\u03b8\u2248\u03c0 =\nQJ \u2212 Qcrit\nJ,\u03c0 + O(1) ,\nI1 (\u03c0 \u2212 \u03b8)2\nwhere we define the 'critical Jellett quantity at \u03b8 = \u03c0' as:\n\n(23)\n\n(24)\n\n(25)\n\nQcrit\n(26)\nJ,\u03c0 \u2261 \u2212\u03c1\u03c0 (1 + a)I3 QR .\np\nwith \u03c1\u03c0 = 1/ I3 + (I3 /I1 )(1 + a)2 .\n\u2022 Monotonicity property. The factor [QJ \u2212 \u03c1f I3 QR ] appearing on the right-hand\nside of (19) is a monotonic function of the angle \u03b8 \u2208 [0, \u03c0]. The proof of this is\nstraightforward.\n\n\fPrecession and recession of the rock'n'roller\n\n10\n\nFrom the above asymptotic expansions, we conclude that, in the space of initial\nconditions parameterised by (QR , QJ ), there are four regions of interest, and the\nbehaviour of \u03c6\u0307 is qualitatively different in each region:\ncrit\nRegion I: QR > 0, Qcrit\nJ,\u03c0 < QJ < QJ,0 . The function V\u03c6 (\u03b8, QJ , QR ) goes from \u2212\u221e\nat \u03b8 = 0 to \u221e at \u03b8 = \u03c0. From the monotonicity property it follows that this\nfunction has a single zero.\ncrit\nRegion II: Qcrit\nJ,\u03c0 < QJ , QJ,0 < QJ . The function V\u03c6 (\u03b8, QJ , QR ) goes from \u221e at\n\u03b8 = 0 to \u221e at \u03b8 = \u03c0. From the monotonicity property it is possible to show that\nthis function is positive definite and has a single minimum.\ncrit\nRegion III: QR < 0, Qcrit\nJ,0 < QJ < QJ,\u03c0 . The function V\u03c6 (\u03b8, QJ , QR ) goes from \u221e\nat \u03b8 = 0 to \u2212\u221e at \u03b8 = \u03c0. From the monotonicity property it follows that this\nfunction has a single zero.\ncrit\nRegion IV: QJ < Qcrit\nJ,\u03c0 , QJ < QJ,0 . The function V\u03c6 (\u03b8, QJ , QR ) goes from \u2212\u221e at\n\u03b8 = 0 to \u2212\u221e at \u03b8 = \u03c0. From the monotonicity property it is possible to show\nthat this function is negative definite and has a single maximum.\n\nSimilar results can be obtained for the velocities \u03c8\u0307, but these are omitted here.\nIn figure 4 we show the four regions, separated by the two critical lines QJ = Qcrit\nJ,\u03c0\n(solid red line from top left to bottom right) and QJ = Qcrit\nJ,0 (dashed blue line, from\nbottom left to top right). Typical plots of the function V\u03c6 (\u03b8, QJ , QR ) versus \u03b8 are\ninserted in each region. The asymptotic behaviours are evident.\nThe critical Jellett quantity Qcrit\nJ,\u03c0 plays a key role in determining the visible\nprecession angle \u2206\u03c6 (mod 2\u03c0) in the interesting case \u03b8X \u2248 \u03c0. The main contribution\nto the precession angle comes from the turning point \u03b8 = \u03b8X and from (25) we see\nthat the sign of this contribution depends on the sign of QJ \u2212 Qcrit\nJ,\u03c0 . For example,\ncrit\nif an initial condition with QJ \u2212 QJ,\u03c0 ' 0 (Regions I or II) has a precession angle\n\u2206\u03c6 = \u03b10 (mod 2\u03c0), then a slightly different initial condition with QJ \u2212 Qcrit\nJ,\u03c0 / 0\n(Regions IV or III) will have a precession angle \u2206\u03c6 = \u2212\u03b10 (mod 2\u03c0); the corresponding\nmotion will appear to be reversed.\nThe critical Jellett quantity Qcrit\nJ,0 determines the full precession angle \u2206\u03c6 when\n\u03b8N \u2248 0. The main contribution to \u2206\u03c6 comes from the turning point \u03b8N , and is\ngiven by rapid changes of \u03c6 in jumps of approximately \u00b1\u03c0, the sign of these jumps\ndepending on the sign of QJ \u2212 Qcrit\nJ,0 . In this way, an initial condition in Region I or\nIV will give rise to a full-angle precession \u2206\u03c6 < 0 whereas, for initial conditions in\nRegion II or III, \u2206\u03c6 > 0. It is worth mentioning that this critical quantity is related\nto the energy of the system since it appears in the Laurent expansion of the function\nF (\u03b8) near \u03b8 = 0. See [7], where this critical quantity was identified in terms of the\ncentrifugal barrier.\n2.6. Quantitative estimate of applicability of criticality criteria\nLet us consider the asymptotic region \u03b8 \u2248 \u03c0. For the above asymptotic analysis to\nbe of practical importance, the maximum rocking angle \u03b8X must be close to \u03c0. Only\nthen will the asymptotic Laurent expansion (25) determine, to a good approximation,\nthe value of \u03c6\u0307 at \u03b8 = \u03b8X . In particular, we will observe a dramatic difference in \u03c6\u0307 at\n\u03b8 = \u03b8X and in the precession angle when considering two nearby points, one in Region\nI and one in Region IV.\nTo quantify how close should \u03b8X be to \u03c0, necessary conditions are: (i) In Regions\nI and III, \u03b8z , the zero of \u03c6\u0307(\u03b8), must be less than \u03b8X ; (ii) In Regions II and IV, \u03b8e ,\n\n\f11\n\nPrecession and recession of the rock'n'roller\n\nQR\nd\u03a6\n\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080 H\u0398 L , QR =0, QJ =1\ndt\n75\n50\n25\n\u03a0\n\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\n4\n\nd\u03a6\n\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080 H\u0398 L , QR =-1, QJ =0\ndt\n\n0\n\n\u03a0\n\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\n4\n\n\u03a0\n\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\n2\n\n3\u03a0\n\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\n4\n\n3\u03a0\n\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\n4\n\n\u03a0\n\n\u0398\n\nd\u03a6\n\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080 H\u0398 L , QR =1, QJ =0\ndt\n\nII\n\n75\n50\n25\n-25\n-50\n-75\n\n\u03a0\n\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\n2\n\n\u03a0\n\nIII\n\n\u0398\n\n75\n50\n25\n\nI\n\n-25\n-50\n-75\n\nIV\n\n\u03a0\n\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\n4\n\n\u03a0\n\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\n2\n\n3\u03a0\n\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\n4\n\n\u03a0\n\n\u0398\n\nQJ\n\n-25\n-50\n-75\n\nd\u03a6\n\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080 H\u0398 L , QR =0, QJ =-1\ndt\n75\n50\n25\n-25\n-50\n-75\n\n\u03a0\n\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\n4\n\n\u03a0\n\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\n2\n\n3\u03a0\n\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\u0080\n4\n\n\u03a0\n\n\u0398\n\n0\nFigure 4. (Colour online). The four critical regions defined by the critical lines\ncrit\nQJ = Qcrit\nJ,\u03c0 (red, top left to bottom right) and QJ = QJ,0 (blue, bottom left to\ntop right). In each region, the graph of \u03c6\u0307 as function of \u03b8 is shown, for selected\nvalues QR , QJ and parameters a = 0.05, I3 = 2/5 and I1 = (1 \u2212 5 a/2)I3 .\n\nthe extremum of \u03c6\u0307(\u03b8), must be less than \u03b8X .

Recession of the Asymmetric Body (I\uf731 6= I\uf732 )\nIn this section we give a precise description of recession, or reversal of precession, of the\nrock'n'roller. The definition is based on observational evidence: for initial conditions\nclose to pure rocking motion and such that the local maxima (turning points) of the\ntilting angle \u03b8 are in the range (\u223c 3/4\u03c0, \u03c0), the rates of change \u03c6\u0307(tj ) and \u03c8\u0307(tj ) at\ntimes tj , j = 1, ..., \u221e where the angle \u03b8(tj ) is a (local) maximum \u03b8X (tj ), depend\non the time tj , contrary to the case of the symmetric body. The functions \u03c6\u0307(tj )\nand \u03c8\u0307(tj ) have a quasi-periodic behaviour, undergoing changes of sign that translates\nobservationally to alternating reversals of the visible precession angles \u2206\u03c6(tj ) (mod 2\u03c0)\nand \u2206\u03c8(tj ) (mod 2\u03c0), where\nZ tj\nZ tj\n\u03c8\u0307(t) dt .\n\u03c6\u0307(t) dt ,\n\u2206\u03c8(tj ) =\n\u2206\u03c6(tj ) =\ntj\u22122\n\ntj\u22122\n\nNote that the integration is from tj\u22122 to tj , which accounts for a full period of motion.\nIn the dynamical region of interest, \u03b8X (tj ) \u2208 (\u223c 3/4\u03c0, \u03c0), the critical quantities\ndefined in \u00a72.5 allow us to understand the behaviour qualitatively, and to predict\nthe occurrence of reversals.\nThe key observation from numerical simulations is that, in the asymmetric case,\nthe Jellett and Routh quantities, (16) and (17), cease to be conserved, but oscillate\nabout mean values. We thus define the Jellett and Routh quantities QJ and QR to\nbe\n\u03c9\u2032\n(28)\nQJ (t) = I1 s\u03c92\u2032 + I3 f \u03c93\u2032 ,\nQR (t) = 3 .\n\u03c1\nWe have observed that these quantities oscillate about time-averaged values with a\nperiod that is generally longer than the period of the rocking motion, and that depends\non the amplitude of the motion. We remark that the motion in the (QR , QJ )-plane\nis bounded. We will perform a numerical study of this behaviour in connection with\nreversals at the end of next section. The analytical study of this will be the subject\nof forthcoming work.\nThe analysis in \u00a72.5 regarding the asymptotic behaviour of \u03c6\u0307 near the turning\npoints, remains valid if we consider QJ (t) and QR (t) to be functions of time. In\nparticular, as long as the point (QR (t), QJ (t)) remains within one of the Regions I to\nIV, we can safely conclude that there is no reversal of the system, because the sign\nof \u03c6\u0307 at the turning points cannot possibly change. Reversal is due to crossing of the\nsystem from one region to an adjacent one. In order to observe reversal, we need\nto initialize the system sufficiently close to the boundary of a region in such a way\nthat, during the evolution of the motion, the system crosses the boundary. We call\nthis a critical crossing. Due to the oscillating nature of QJ (t) and QR (t) evidenced in\nnumerical simulations, if this critical crossing happens then the system will eventually\ncross back to the original region and will continue crossing periodically back and forth\nbetween the two regions, in a bounded motion within the space (QR , QJ ).\n\n\f13\n\nPrecession and recession of the rock'n'roller\n\nCorresponding to the critical crossings of the two types of critical quantities -\ncrit\nQcrit\nJ,0 defined at the turning point near \u03b8 = 0 and QJ,\u03c0 defined at that near \u03b8 = \u03c0 -\nthere are two types of reversal. On the one hand, the full angle, \u03c6(t), has reversals that\nare related to the critical crossings of Qcrit\nJ,0 . This is due to the fact that, for motion\nclose to pure rocking, the main change of \u03c6(t) from t = tj\u22121 to t = tj is typically\na jump of magnitude about \u03c0 when \u03b8 passes the turning point \u03b8N . The sign of this\njump depends on which critical region the system is in, and will therefore change when\nreversal occurs. Critical crossings from Region I to Region II or from Region III to\nRegion IV correspond to this type of reversal.\nOn the other hand, the visible precession angle, \u2206\u03c6(tj ) (mod 2\u03c0), is due mainly\nto the change of \u03c6(t) near the turning point \u03b8X . The sign of this change depends\nexclusively on the criticality Qcrit\nJ,\u03c0 . Critical crossings from Region IV to Region I or\nfrom Region II to Region III determine this type of reversal. This reversal corresponds\nto the recession evident in real experiments. A numerical study of the two types of\nreversal will be presented in \u00a76 below.\n4. Asymmetric Body (I\uf731 6= I\uf732 ): The Dynamical Equations\nWe now derive the equations for the asymmetric case I1 6= I2 . Since the intermediate\nframe (i\u2032 , j \u2032 , k\u2032 ) is no longer a principal frame, it is convenient to use a body frame\n(i, j, k) aligned in the direction of the principal axes. The angular velocity and angular\nmomentum are then\n\u03c9 = \u03c91 i + \u03c92 j + \u03c93 k\n\nL = I1 \u03c91 i + I2 \u03c92 j + I3 \u03c93 k .\n\nThe momentum equations of motion in the body frame are\nv\u03071 + \u03c92 v3 \u2212 \u03c93 v2 = F1\nv\u03072 + \u03c93 v1 \u2212 \u03c91 v3 = F2\n\n(29)\n\nv\u03073 + \u03c91 v2 \u2212 \u03c92 v1 = F3\nand the angular momentum equations are\nI1 \u03c9\u03071 + (I3 \u2212 I2 )\u03c92 \u03c93 = G1\nI2 \u03c9\u03072 + (I1 \u2212 I3 )\u03c93 \u03c91 = G2\nI3 \u03c9\u03073 + (I2 \u2212 I1 )\u03c91 \u03c92 = G3\n\n(30)\n\nWe proceed as in \u00a72, using the constraint (9) to express the velocity v in terms of\nthe rotation \u03c9 and eliminating the moment G by means of the momentum equations.\nThe result may be written\n\u03a3\u03b8\u0307 = \u03c9 ,\nwhere\n\nthe matrices \u03a3\n\uf8ee\n\u03c7 s\u03c3\n\u03a3 = \uf8f0 \u2212\u03c3 s\u03c7\n0\nc\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\u03b8\u0307\n\u03b8\u0307 = \uf8ed \u03c6\u0307 \uf8f8 ,\n\u03c8\u0307\n\nK \u03c9\u0307 = P\u03c9\n\n(31)\n\n\uf8f6\n\u03c9\u03071\n\u03c9\u0307 = \uf8ed \u03c9\u03072 \uf8f8 ,\n\u03c9\u03073\n\uf8eb\n\nand K are\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\n0\nI1 + f 2 + s2 \u03c72\n0\uf8fb\nK =\uf8f0\n\u2212s2 \u03c3\u03c7\n1\n\u2212f s\u03c3\n\n\u2212s2 \u03c3\u03c7\nI2 + f 2 + s2 \u03c3 2\n\u2212f s\u03c7\n\n\uf8f9\n\u2212f s\u03c3\n\u2212f s\u03c7 \uf8fb ,\nI3 + s2\n\n(32)\n\n\fPrecession and recession of the rock'n'roller\n\n14\n\nand the vector P\u03c9 is\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\u2212(g + \u03c912 + \u03c922 )as\u03c7 + (I2 \u2212 I3 \u2212 af )\u03c92 \u03c93\nP\u03c9 = \uf8ed (g + \u03c912 + \u03c922 )as\u03c3 + (I3 \u2212 I1 + af )\u03c91 \u03c93 \uf8f8 ,\n(I1 \u2212 I2 )\u03c91 \u03c92 + as(\u2212\u03c7\u03c91 + \u03c3\u03c92 )\u03c93\n\nwith \u03c7 = cos \u03c8 and \u03c3 = sin \u03c8. Note that neither K nor P\u03c9 depends explicitly on \u03c6.\nThus \u03c6 is an ignorable coordinate in the system (31).\n4.1. Special solutions\nWe consider pure rocking motion with \u03c6 and \u03c8 constant. Then \u03c9 = (\u03c7\u03b8\u0307, \u2212\u03c3 \u03b8\u0307, 0).\nSystem (31) implies\n(I1 \u2212 I2 )\u03c3\u03c7\u03b8\u03072 = 0\nso that a nontrivial solution requires \u03c3\u03c7 = 0. That is, the rocking motion must be\nabout one of the principal axes. For \u03c3 = 0 the system reduces to (12), pure rocking\nabout the i-axis. For \u03c7 = 0 we get the corresponding equation with I2 replacing\nI1 and pure rocking about the j-axis. From (13), the ratio of the small amplitude\noscillations about these principal axes is\nr\nI2 + 1\n\u03bd1\n=\n.\n\u03bd2\nI1 + 1\nIn general, there are no periodic solutions corresponding to the pure rolling motion\nfound in the symmetric case. However, if \u03b8 remains zero, we may have spinning about\nthe k-axis, with k vertical. Then \u03c9 = (0, 0, \u03c8\u0307). The equations (31) reduce to I3 \u03c9\u03073 = 0,\nconfirming that the spin rate is an arbitrary constant.\n4.2. Nonholonomic constraints\nThe rock'n'roller is subject to three constraints, one holonomic and two nonholonomic.\nThe body must remain in contact with the underlying surface, and the point of contact\nmust be momentarily stationary to ensure rolling contact. We can embrace the three\nconstraints in the single equation (9), i.e, v = \u03c9 \u00d7 r. We will now express this in\nterms of the space frame. The velocities in the body and space frames, v and V\nrespectively, are related by v = \u03a5T V or, explicitly,\n\uf8eb \uf8f6 \uf8ee\n\uf8f9T \uf8eb \uf8f6\nv1\nc\u03c6 \u03c7 \u2212 cs\u03c6 \u03c3 \u2212c\u03c6 \u03c3 \u2212 cs\u03c6 \u03c7 ss\u03c6\nV1\n\uf8ed v2 \uf8f8 = \uf8f0 s\u03c6 \u03c7 + cc\u03c6 \u03c3 \u2212s\u03c6 \u03c3 + cc\u03c6 \u03c7 \u2212sc\u03c6 \uf8fb \uf8ed V2 \uf8f8\n(33)\nv3\ns\u03c3\ns\u03c7\nc\nV3\nwhere c\u03c6 = cos \u03c6 and s\u03c6 = sin \u03c6. The matrix \u03a5 is the product of three rotations, and\nis derived in many standard texts in mechanics; see, for example, [8, 11, 12, 18, 20].\nWe write \u03c9 \u00d7 r = \u0393\u03c9 and \u03c9 = \u03a3\u03b8\u0307, where\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n0\nf\n\u2212s\u03c7\n\u0393 = \uf8f0 \u2212f\n0\ns\u03c3 \uf8fb .\n(34)\ns\u03c7 \u2212s\u03c3\n0\n\nNow the constraints can be expressed in the form V = \u03a5\u0393\u03a3 \u03b8\u0307, relating the velocity\nin the space frame to the time derivatives of the Euler angles. More explicitly,\n\uf8eb \uf8f6 \uf8ee\n\uf8f9\uf8eb \uf8f6\n\u1e8a\nhs\u03c6 \u2212asc\u03c6 \u2212sc\u03c6\n\u03b8\u0307\n\uf8ed \u1e8e \uf8f8 = \uf8f0 \u2212hc\u03c6 \u2212ass\u03c6 \u2212ss\u03c6 \uf8fb \uf8ed \u03c6\u0307 \uf8f8 .\n(35)\n\u017b\nas\n0\n0\n\u03c8\u0307\n\n\fPrecession and recession of the rock'n'roller\n\n15\n\nIt is clear from this form that the constraint on \u017b is holonomic and may be integrated\nimmediately to give Z = 1 \u2212 ac = h, the height of the mass centre in terms of the\ntilting angle \u03b8. The constraints on \u1e8a and \u1e8e are nonholonomic.\n5. Lagrangian formulation\nSystems with holonomic constraints can be solved by elimination of redundant\ncoordinates or by adding to the Lagrangian a sum of the constraints weighted by\nLagrange multipliers. When the constraints are nonholonomic, this procedure does\nnot apply [11, 20]. We must resist the temptation to substitute (9) into the Lagrangian\nand obtain a Lagrangian that involves only the Euler angles and their derivatives.\nRather, we must embed the problem in a configuration space of dimension N + M ,\nwhere N is the number of degrees of freedom and M the number of nonholonomic\nconstraints. There has been considerable misunderstanding regarding nonholonomic\nconstraints; see [6] for a review. When the constraints are of the form\ngk (q, q\u0307, t) \u2261 Ak (q, t)q\u0307 = 0 ,\nthat is, where they are linear in the velocities, we can write the equations of motion\nin the form\nd \u2202L \u2202L X \u2202gk\n\u2212\n+\n= 0.\n(36)\n\u03bck\ndt \u2202 q\u0307\n\u2202q\n\u2202 q\u0307\nk\n\nwhere \u03bck are Lagrange multipliers that can be determined using the constraints.\nIn the present case, the configuration space has five dimensions, with coordinates\n(\u03b8, \u03c6, \u03c8, X, Y ), the holonomic constraint having been used to eliminate Z. We may\nwrite the Lagrangian in terms of these coordinates and their time derivatives:\n\b\nL = 21 (I1 \u03c72 + I2 \u03c3 2 + a2 s2 )\u03b8\u03072 + 2(I1 \u2212 I2 )s\u03c7\u03c3 \u03b8\u0307\u03c6\u0307\n+ [(I1 \u03c3 2 + I2 \u03c72 )s2 + I3 c2 ]\u03c6\u03072 + 2I3 c \u03c6\u0307\u03c8\u0307 + I3 \u03c8\u0307 2\n+ (\u1e8a 2 + \u1e8e 2 ) \u2212 ga(1 \u2212 c) .\n\n(37)\n\nNote that L does not depend on \u03c6. From (35), the nonholonomic constraints are\ng1 \u2261 \u1e8a \u2212 ( hs\u03c6 \u03b8\u0307 \u2212 asc\u03c6 \u03c6\u0307 \u2212 sc\u03c6 \u03c8\u0307) = 0\ng2 \u2261 \u1e8e \u2212 (\u2212hc\u03c6 \u03b8\u0307 \u2212 ass\u03c6 \u03c6\u0307 \u2212 ss\u03c6 \u03c8\u0307) = 0\n\n(38)\n\nAlthough\n\u03c6 occurs in these expressions, it is absent from the combinations\nP\n\u03bc\n\u2202g\n/\u2202\nq\u0307 that occur in the equations. This symmetry should imply the existence\nk\nk\nk\nof an invariant quantity in addition to the total energy.\nThe Euler-Lagrange equations (36) for X and Y immediately yield\n\u03bc1 = \u2212\u1e8c\n\n\u03bc2 = \u2212\u0178 .\n\nUsing the constraints, we may now eliminate the multipliers \u03bc1 and \u03bc2 from the\nremaining equations and obtain a system of three equations for \u03b8, \u03c6 and \u03c8. They may\nbe written\nM \u03b8\u0308 + P\u03b8 (\u03b8, \u03b8\u0307) = 0\nT\n\n(39)\n\nwhere \u03b8\u0308 = (\u03b8\u0308, \u03c6\u0308, \u03c8\u0308) and M is a symmetric matrix. The explicit expansion of (39) is\ngiven in the Appendix (\u00a7A.3). Using Mathematica, the system has been shown to be\ncompletely equivalent to the system (31).\n\n\fPrecession and recession of the rock'n'roller\n\n16\n\nIn general, we can write the Lagrangian in the form\nL = L0 (\u03b8, \u03b8\u0307) + \u01ebL1 (\u03b8, \u03c8, \u03b8\u0307)\nwhere L0 is the Lagrangian for the integrable symmetric system and \u01eb \u2261 (I2 \u2212 I1 )/I1\nis the asymmetry parameter. This provides a basis for a perturbation analysis when \u01eb\nis small, which will not be undertaken here but will be the subject of future work.\n6. Numerical Experiments\nThe numerical integration of the equations is delicate, as there is a singularity of the\ncoordinate system when \u03b8 = 0, and significant errors may result from this. To be sure\nof reliable numerical results, we used a routine of eighth-order accuracy, ode87, coded\nby Vasiliy Govorukhin (http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/), which is a\nrealization of the formulae of Prince and Dorman [14]. With this method, invariants\nof the motion remained constant to high accuracy. To further confirm the robustness\nof the numerics, we coded both sets of equations, the system (31) in terms of (\u03b8\u0307, \u03c9\u0307)\nand the system (39) in terms of (\u03b8\u0307, \u03b8\u0308), and compared the results. Furthermore, we\nverified the matlab coding by an independent coding in Mathematica. Finally, the\nresults presented below were checked for convergence by varying the error tolerance.\nWe can therefore be confident in the reliability of the numerical results.\nUnless otherwise stated, the numerical values of the parameters are set as follows:\ngravity g = 9.87, unit mass, unit radius, centre of mass off-centering a = 0.05,\nmoments of inertia I1 = 0.35 and I3 = 0.4. Some initial conditions will not be\nvaried in the various simulations; these are \u03b80 = 0.95\u03c0, \u03b8\u03070 = 0 and \u03c60 = 0.\n6.1. The consequence of asymmetry\nWe first compare the numerical solution of equations (31) for the symmetric case\nI1 = I2 and for a case of slight asymmetry. The solutions are for 1500 time units and\nthe initial conditions are, in each case, \u03b80 = 0.95\u03c0, \u03c60 = \u03c80 = 0, \u03c91,0 = 0, \u03c92,0 = 0.001,\n\u03c93,0 = \u22120.001. Figure 5 (top left panel) shows the trajectory of the point of contact\nfor the symmetric case I1 = I2 . The azimuthal angle increases regularly and steadily\nfor each cycle of rocking motion. This is confirmed by figure 5, top right panel, which\nshows \u03c6 at the points where \u03b8 reaches a maximum. For the solution shown in the\nbottom panels of figure 5, the only difference is a increase of 0.1% in the inertial\nmoment about j, so that \u01eb = (I2 \u2212 I1 )/I1 = 10\u22123 . The bottom left panel shows the\ntrajectory of the point of contact: the precession is no longer uniform. The azimuthal\nangle alternately increases and decreases (figure 5 bottom right panel). We see that\nthere is recession, with a period much longer than that of the rocking motion. Thus, a\nminute change in the mass distribution of the body, that changes the inertial structure\nslightly and breaks the symmetry I1 = I2 , has a dramatic effect on the character of\nthe motion.\n6.2. Stability of rocking motion\nWe initiate the motion from a stationary state with \u03c9(0) = 0 and \u03b8(0) = 0.95\u03c0.\nClearly, a symmetric body started in this configuration would execute pure rocking\nmotion, passing repeatedly through the equilibrium position, with \u03c6 and \u03c8 remaining\nconstant (apart from jumps of \u03c0 due to the coordinate singularity at \u03b8 = 0).

Bottom left and right:\ncorresponding solution for the asymmetric case I2 = 1.001I1 .\n\nasymmetric body, the solution depends on the initial angle \u03c8(0) = \u03c80 . As before, we\nassume the asymmetry is slight, with I2 = 1.001I1 .\nThe trajectory of the point of contact of the rock'n'roller is shown in figure 6\nfor \u03c80 in the set {\u03c0/100, \u03c0/8, \u03c0/4, 3\u03c0/8, 3.9\u03c0/8, \u03c0/2}. All integrations are for 1000\ntime units. We see that the motion precesses through an angle \u03a6 = \u03c6max \u2212 \u03c6min that\ndepends sensitively on the initial phase \u03c80 . It appears that the relationship\n\u03a6 = \u03c0 \u2212 2\u03c80\n\nfor\n\n\u03c80 \u2208 (0, \u03c0)\n\nis satisfied, at least approximately.\nThe cases \u03c80 = 0 and \u03c80 = \u03c0/2 correspond to pure rocking about the principal\naxes with moments of inertia I2 and I1 respectively. Motion close to pure rocking\nabout the I1 axis is stable (figure 6(E)) while that starting close to the I2 axis changes\ndramatically, precessing through almost 180\u25e6 (figure 6(A)). We recall the classical\nresult for free motions of a rigid body with I1 < I2 < I3 , where rotation about the I2\naxis is unstable whereas rotations about the I1 and I3 axes are stable.\nIn general we expect the trajectory to be dense in the domain of angle \u03a6 spanned\nby the solution. However, KAM theory [1, 13] suggests that for exceptional initial\nconditions the solution is periodic.

All integrations are for 1000\ntime units. The small circles indicate the starting position in each case.\n\nappears to be close to a periodic solution (figure 6(D)). Searching in the neighborhood\nof this solution, we found that when \u03c80 = 2.965\u03c0/8 the trajectory becomes periodic,\nrepeatedly tracing out the same track, some fifteen times in 1000 seconds. Solutions\nof this nature, whose trajectories span a set of measure zero, are a signature of\nintegrability.\n6.3. Recession and Criticality\nWe now present a numerical study of reversals based on the theory of criticality\ndescribed in \u00a72.5. In all cases, the numerical experiments consist of releasing the\nrock'n'roller at an angle \u03b80 = 0.95\u03c0, with \u03b8\u03070 = 0 and with an angle \u03c80 = \u03c0/4 half-way\nbetween the body's principal axes. System (31) is integrated numerically for 200 time\nunits, using an adaptive Mathematica code (stiffness-switching method) with 11th\norder accuracy. The results are insensitive to resolution improvements.

For full details, see text.\n\n\fPrecession and recession of the rock'n'roller\n\n22\n\nIn figures 7, 8 and 9 all parameters are identical except for the initial conditions.\nIn all three cases, \u03b80 = 0.95\u03c0, \u03b8\u03070 = 0, \u03c60 = 0, \u03c80 = \u03c0/4. Parameter values are\na = 0.05, g = 9.87, I3 = 2/5, I1 = (1 \u2212 5a/2)I3 , \u01eb = (I2 \u2212 I1 )/I1 = 10\u22123 . The top\nframe in each case shows the orbit in the (QR , QJ )-plane for 200 time units (zigzagging\nbounded curve (black)). In all three cases, the orbit starts at a point on one of the\ncritical lines and begins moving to the bottom right, subsequently alternating between\nadjacent critical regions. The straight lines from top left to bottom right (red) denote\nthe critical line QJ = Qcrit\nJ,\u03c0 , useful for visible angle reversal. The straight lines from\nbottom left to top right (blue) denote the critical line QJ = Qcrit\nJ,0 , useful for full angle\nreversal. Dots correspond to instances when \u03b8(t) is near the turning points: red dots\ndenote \u03b8 \u2265 0.99\u03b80 (near turning point \u03b8X ) and blue dots denote \u03b8 < 0.005\u03b80 (near\nturning point \u03b8N ). The middle frame in each case shows the azimuth angle \u03c6(t). Solid\nlines (red) denote instances when \u03b8 \u2265 0.5\u03b80 and dashed lines (blue) denote instances\nwhen \u03b8 < 0.5\u03b80 . The bottom frames show the visible (half) angle \u03c6(t) (mod \u03c0) sampled\nwhen \u03b8 \u2265 0.5\u03b80 .\nIn figure 7, the initial velocities are \u03c6\u03070 = \u03c8\u03070 = 0. The motion remains close to\nthe centre QR = QJ = 0, i.e., close to pure rocking (black zigzagging orbit in top\nframe). The system alternates between Regions I and III, spending approximately\nfive periods of rocking motion in each region. Consequently, both full-angle reversal\n(middle frame) and visible angle reversal (bottom frame) can be observed. This case\ncorresponds exactly to case (C) in figure 6.\nIn figure 8, the initial conditions are right on the critical line QJ = Qcrit\nJ,\u03c0 : the\ninitial velocities are \u03c6\u03070 = \u22120.002 and \u03c8\u03070 = 0.002. The orbit is very similar in shape\nand size to the orbit in the previous case. We observe two critical crossings between\nRegion I and Region IV, corresponding to visible angle reversals (bottom frame).\nThere is no full angle reversal (middle frame).\nIn figure 9, the initial conditions are right on the critical line QJ = Qcrit\nJ,0 : the\ninitial velocities are \u03c6\u03070 = 0.379 and \u03c8\u03070 = 0.378. The orbit differs in shape from the\nones seen above and its horizontal dimension is three times smaller. We observe eleven\ncritical crossings between Region I and Region II, corresponding to full angle reversals\n(middle frame). There is no visible angle reversal (bottom frame).\nWe notice in each of the three cases that, regardless of the apparent complexity\nof the orbits, when the system is near one of the turning points (\u03b8 = \u03b8X (tj ), red dots;\n\u03b8 = \u03b8N (tj ), blue dots), the points (QR , QJ ) are distributed along a straight line (top\nframe in each case). In figure 10 a plot is shown combining the orbits of the three\ninitial conditions used in figures 7, 8 and 9, in order to compare their distribution and\nextent in the plane (QR , QJ ).\nIt is evident from the above that the criticality criterion is a useful description\nof both full angle and visible angle reversals. One just needs to initialize the system\nnear a critical line and the dynamics will do the rest. However, we do not yet have an\nexplanation for the extent of the orbit, so our method is only descriptive and cannot\npredict, for example, the number of rocking cycles executed in each critical region.\nForthcoming work should be dedicated to this subject.\nRegarding visible angle reversals, we have found that these cease to be observed\nif the initial (QR , QJ ) is chosen far enough from the origin (keeping all other initial\nconditions fixed). This can be understood from the fact that the asymptotic Laurent\nexpansion in (25) is valid only near \u03b8 = \u03c0 but the maximum attainable \u03b8(t) is bounded,\nfrom energy conservation, by \u03b80 , which is strictly less than \u03c0.

Right frame: visible angle\n\u03c6 mod 2\u03c0, sampled at times tj when \u03b8(tj ) attains its maximum value \u03b8X (tj ).\n\nin \u00a72.6, and equation (27), it follows that the necessary condition for validity of the\nLaurent expansion becomes QR \u2264 0.1 for the present choice of parameters and initial\nconditions, where we have used the observational estimate (from figure 10) of 0.001 for\nthe orbit extension along the QR -axis. We have checked that there is indeed reversal\nfor QR = 0.1 (see figure 11, left frame). It is important to mention that at this\nrelatively high value of QR (and correspondingly high angular velocity) the lowestorder Laurent asymptotic expansion given in (25) needs to be improved. As a result,\nthe simple interpretation of reversals in terms of critical crossings and changes of sign\nof \u03c6\u0307 will change slightly. In practice, to observe recession in this limiting case, it is\nnecessary to offset slightly the initial condition in the plane (QR , QJ ), to a point above\nthe critical line QJ = Qcrit\nJ,\u03c0 . The resulting orbit remains in Region I so that there is\nno change in sign of \u03c6\u0307(tj ). However, the visible precession angle \u2206\u03c6(tj ) (mod 2\u03c0),\nbeing determined by an integral in time, can and does have reversals (figure 11, right\nframe).\n\n\fPrecession and recession of the rock'n'roller\n\n24\n\n7. Conclusion\nExperiments show that the recession, or reversal of precession, is a robust feature of\nthe motion of the physical rock'n'roller. Analysis has confirmed that for a perfectly\nsymmetric body with I1 = I2 this behaviour is impossible. However, even the slightest\nbreaking of this inertial symmetry is sufficient to change the character of the solution\nprofoundly, allowing entirely new types of motion. Physical experiments and numerical\nresults show that the reversal angle \u03a6 = \u03c6max \u2212 \u03c6min depends sensitively on the\ninitial conditions. For motion that is initially close to pure rocking, the angle \u03a6\ncan be controlled by the choice of the initial phase angle \u03c80 . A rigourous analytical\ndemonstration of this result is outstanding.\nThe symmetric equations are integrable, with three invariants: the total energy E,\nJellett's quantity QJ and Routh's quantity QR . In the asymmetric case, only one of the\nabove three quantities is conserved, namely the total energy. We present an analysis\nof recession based on the existence of critical lines dividing the (QR , QJ )-plane into 4\ndynamically disjoint regions. We prove that recession is directly related to the lack\nof conservation of Jellett's and Routh's quantities, by identifying individual reversals\nas crossings of the orbit (QR (t), QJ (t)) through the critical lines. The criticality\ncriterion allows one to produce a family of initial conditions so that the system will\nexhibit recession.\nIn the asymmetric case, there remains an underlying geometric symmetry -\ninvariance under change of the azimuthal angle \u03c6 - so it is arguable that another\ndynamical invariant exists. In the realistic case where gravity is present, this additional\nintegral (if it exists) remains to be found. Notice that Borisov and Mamaev [2] indicate\nin their Table 1 that the quantity M 2 \u2212 2Kr 2 is conserved in the asymmetric case\n(where M is the angular momentum about the contact point); however this is only\ntrue in the absence of gravity.\nThere is apparently a slow period of the orbit (QR (t), QJ (t)). This suggests\nmulti-scale analysis as an appropriate technique for analysis of this problem. For\nsmall asymmetry \u01eb \u2261 (I2 \u2212 I1 )/I1 the problem may be formulated as a perturbed\nintegrable Lagrangian system, and is amenable to standard asymptotic analysis. This\nwill be the subject of future work. KAM theory [1, 13] would indicate that certain\naspects of integrability should apply to the weakly asymmetric rock'n'roller. However,\nthe question of the general integrability of the system remains open.\nAcknowledgements\nWe are grateful to Darryl Holm for inspiring conversations during the course of this\nwork.
