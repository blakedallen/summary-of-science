The nature of these striations has, however, remained unclear. Here\nwe present an analysis of small scale motions in penumbral filaments in both simulations and observations. The simulations, when viewed from above, show fine\nstructure with dark lanes running outwards from the dark core of the penumbral\nfilaments. The dark lanes either occur preferentially on one side or alternate between both sides of the filament. We identify this fine structure with transverse\n(kink) oscillations of the filament, corresponding to a sideways swaying of the\nfilament. These oscillations have periods in the range of 5-7 min and propagate\noutward and downward along the filament. Similar features are found in observed\nG-band intensity time series of penumbral filaments in a sunspot located near\ndisk center obtained by the Broadband Filter Imager (BFI) on board Hinode.\nWe also find that some filaments show dark striations moving to both sides of\nthe filaments. Based on the agreement between simulations and observations we\nconclude that the motions of these striations are caused by transverse oscillations\nof the underlying bright filaments.\nSubject headings: Sun: sunspots\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nHigh resolution Hinode and Swedish Solar Telescope observations of sunspots located\naway from disk center have revealed fine structure in penumbral filaments: filaments\nwhich are nearly perpendicular to the solar disk radius vector display a \"twisting motion\"\nindicated by dark striations moving across the filaments (i.e. perpendicular to the filament's\naxis) always directed from the limb-side to the center-side of the filament (Ichimoto et al.\n2007). These striations can be used as tracers of the flow, and have observationally\nestablished the presence of overturning convection in the filaments (Zakharov et al. 2008;\nBharti et al. 2010b), an idea which is consistent with theory and recent simulations\n(Heinemann et al. 2007; Rempel et al. 2009a,b). The direct measurement of the velocity\nis more difficult: S\u00e1nchez Almeida et al. (2007) found a local correlation between upflows\nand bright structures as well as between downflows and dark structures in a penumbra.\nSuch correlations are suggestive of convective energy transport in the penumbra. The clear\nsignal of an upflow along the central axis of a bright filament has been reported by Franz\n& Schlichenmaier (2009), Bellot Rubio et al. (2010) and Ichimoto (2010), downflows at\nits sides are more challenging to observe. Line syntheses from sunspot simulations (cf.\nBharti et al. (2011)) suggest that these downflows are partly hidden in observations due\nto both limited spatial resolution, and the fact that commonly used lines form above the\nheights where the downflows are strongest. Moreover, the Evershed flow affects line of\nsight velocities, thus the detection of downflows at edges of filaments also depends on the\nlocation of the sunspot on the solar disk. Recently Joshi et al. (2011) and Scharmer et al.\n(2011) found downflows in dark regions at the edges of the penumbral filaments in the C\nI 5380 \u00c5 line formed deep in the photosphere. The results of these publications support\nthe prediction made by Bharti et al. (2011). Scharmer & Henriques (2011) reported that\ndownflows at the edges of filaments detected in the C I 5380 \u00c5 line (Scharmer et al. (2011))\nare also present in the wing of Fe I 6301.5 \u00c5 with reduced amplitude.\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nThe striations have the advantage that they potentially allow horizontal motions to be\nfollowed, if detected close to disk center, which would make them of unique diagnostic value\nfor the velocity field we have. In previous studies by Ichimoto et al. (2007), Zakharov et al.\n(2008), Spruit et al. (2010) and Bharti et al. (2010b), the apparent twist of the striations\nwas analyzed only in sunspots away from the disk center where the twisting motions is\nseen in filaments perpendicular to the line of symmetry (i.e. in filaments directed parallel\nto the nearest portion of the limb). The twists are always directed toward the center-side.\nThis was interpreted as a geometrical effect by Zakharov et al. (2008) \u2013 these \"twisting\"\nmotions were exclusively interpreted in terms of overturning convective flows perpendicular\nto the filament's major axis (Ichimoto et al. 2007; Zakharov et al. 2008; Scharmer 2009;\nSpruit et al. 2010). Spruit et al. (2010) proposed that these striations originate from the\n\"corrugation of the boundary between an overturning convective flow inside the filament\nand the magnetic field wrapping around it\". Based on their modeling results, they also\nargue that the striations are not compatible with a horizontal field along the axis of\nfilaments in excess of 300 G. However, it is not certain if they really trace convective flows\nor not. This is an important point to establish, since the motions of the striations have\nbeen employed by Zakharov et al. (2008) to conclude that convective motions transport\nsufficient energy to explain the brightness of the penumbra (cf. Bharti et al. (2010b)) . In\nthis paper we use the \"realistic\" numerical radiative MHD simulations of (Rempel et al.\n2009a,b; Rempel 2011) to investigate the causes of the observed brightness striations. In\naddition, we analyze such striations in penumbral structures observed at disk center and\ncompare their properties with those found in the numerical simulations.\nThe paper is organized as follows: in Section 2 we describe the numerical simulation\nand present an analysis of the fine structure we find there, in Section 3 we describe the\nobservations and compare the simulations with the observations. We then present our\nconclusions in Section 4.\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\n2.\n\nNumerical simulations\n\nThe simulations analyzed here were carried out with the MURaM code (V\u00f6gler et al.\n2005). The code includes the effects of partial ionization on the equation of state, and\nnon-grey radiative transfer. For details of the code and the equations see V\u00f6gler et al.\n(2005) and for recent modifications, essential for the sunspot simulations presented here,\nsee Rempel et al. (2009b). This code has been used extensively to treat problems both in\nthe quiet Sun (Keller et al. 2004; Khomenko et al. 2005; V\u00f6gler & Sch\u00fcssler 2007; Pietarila\nGraham et al. 2009, 2010; Danilovic et al. 2010a,b) as well as flux concentrations reaching\nfrom pores to entire active regions (Cameron et al. 2007; Cheung et al. 2008, 2010; Yelles\nChaouche et al. 2009; Sch\u00fcssler & V\u00f6gler 2006; Rempel et al. 2009a,b; Bharti et al. 2010a;\nRempel 2010, 2011).\nHere we present results from two different simulation runs. The first simulation uses\na setup in 'slab' geometry, in which only a narrow slice through the center of a sunspot is\nsimulated. The geometry and size of this simulation make it ideal for studying the detailed\n3 dimensional evolution of individual penumbral filaments, albeit in a somewhat artificial\ngeometry. The second simulation uses a setup with a pair of opposite polarity sunspots,\nleading to more extended penumbrae with a more realistic geometry.\n\n2.1.\n\nSlab Geometry\n\nA snapshot from the sunspot simulation in slab geometry described by Rempel et al.\n(2009b) was used as the initial condition for the calculations presented here. The simulation\ndomain is periodic in both horizontal (x and y) directions, with dimensions of 4.6 Mm \u00d7\n36.864 Mm, and has a dimension of 6.144 Mm in the vertical (z) direction. The average\nvalue of the \u03c4Ross = 1 ( \u03c4Ross = 1 levels refer to optical depth computed from the grey\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nopacities (which is Rossland mean opacity, an \"average\" opacity such that if we assume\nthat the opacity at all frequencies is this average.))height in the quiet Sun is used to define\nz = 0, and z is defined to be positive above this height and negative in the interior of the\nSun. The vertical boundary conditions are unchanged from Rempel et al. (2009b): the top\nboundary is closed and the magnetic field above it is assumed to be potential. The bottom\nboundary is open as described in V\u00f6gler et al. (2005).\nFrom this initial condition, the simulation was continued for 133 minutes of solar time,\nwith snapshots saved every 34.5s.\n\n2.1.1.\n\nSimulation analysis\n\nThe bolometric intensity of the entire simulation domain viewed from above at\nt = 71.9 min is shown in Fig. 1. Several penumbral filaments with central dark cores can be\nseen. In the following we consider the filament in the lower right region of the penumbra\n(21.1 \u2264 y \u2264 28.1 Mm and 0 \u2264 y \u2264 1.44 Mm). A blow up of this region is shown in Fig. 2.\nThere we see that, at the height of the cut z = \u2212384 km (i.e. 384 km below the average\n\u03c4Ross = 1 height of the quiet Sun) there is a continuous upflow along the central part of the\nfilament and downflows along the borders. This cut lies below the local \u03c4Ross = 1 surface,\nso that the shown up and downflows are not directly observable. The filament exhibits\nfine structure in the form of 'wiggles' in the bolometric intensity as well as horizontal and\nvertical velocities along its entire length. The wavelength in the x direction of the 'wiggles',\nat this fixed time, is approximately 700 km. Figure 3 shows that, when viewed at an angle,\ninclined striations which propagate away from the umbra appear, somewhat similar to what\nis seen in the high resolution observations by Ichimoto et al. (2007), Zakharov et al. (2008),\nSpruit et al. (2010) and Bharti et al. (2010b).\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nIn order to study the time evolution of the fine structure, we first focus on cuts across\nthe filament at x = 25.7 Mm. The time evolution of the cuts for various quantities are\nshown in Fig. 4. The range of the intensity image has been restricted in order to better\nreveal the fine structure between t = 50 and t = 90 min. Between t = 0 and t = 30 min\nthere are clear variations in the intensity producing an asymmetric fishbone pattern, as\ndark lanes propagate first to one edge of the filament, then to the other. Somewhat weaker\noscillations occur between 50 and 80 minutes, and these are followed by larger amplitude\noscillations from t \u2248 100 min onwards.\nThese bolometric intensity variations correspond to variations in the vertical velocity,\nwith the minima in intensity corresponding to stronger downflows. These fluctuations are\naccompanied by variations in the y component of the velocity, corresponding to the tube at\nthis height swaying first in the negative y direction, and then in the positive y direction.\nThe second, weaker burst of oscillations occurs between t = 50 and t = 90 min. The\nintensity fluctuations associated with this second set of oscillations are more pronounced\nfor y < 700 km. The weak velocity fluctuations, again best seen in vy , indicate a swaying\nof the tube in the y direction, consistent with magnetic field strength variations which are\nasymmetric. The period of the oscillations in both phases is about 8 min. We emphasize\nthat the perturbations occur across the entire inhomogeneous filament, despite the tube\nhaving very different velocities at different locations.\nThe vertical structure of vy , as a function of time at the three points indicated by stars\nin Fig. 2 is shown in Fig. 5. At x = 25.7 Mm, y = 510 km (top frame of Fig. 5), we see\nthat mostly vy < 0, corresponding to an outflow away from the central axis of the filament.\nAt x = 25.7 Mm, y = 660 km (middle panel), we see that along the center of the filament\nneither flows in the positive or negative y direction dominate and the clearest signature is\nof oscillatory motions. The situation at x = 24.5 Mm, y = 810 km (bottom panel of Fig.\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\n5) is conceptually similar to that at y = 510 km, except that on this side of the filament\nvy > 0 mostly dominates which again corresponds to a lateral outflow from the filament.\nOscillatory motions can be seen, and are in phase at y = 510 km and y = 660 km, and\nespecially at early times at y = 810 km. The oscillations are mainly propagating downwards\n(towards lower z at later times). We measured the wavelength to be \u2248 730 km.\nAs well as studying the x dependence of the oscillations at a particular time as in Fig. 2,\nwe also took a space-time cut along the violet line in Fig. 2. This cut is shown in Fig. 6.\nThe red line is placed at 25.7 Mm, corresponding to the red line in Fig. 2. Oscillations can\nbe seen near the red line between t = 0 and t = 30 min and between t = 50 and t = 90 min.\nThey appear as light and dark ridges running from the umbral end of the filament towards\nthe granulation. The apparent x component of the wavelength is on the order of 1Mm.\np\nThe phase speed of the oscillations \u03c9/ kx2 + kz2 is then approximately 2 km/s. The\nwavevector, (kx , 0, kz ), is inclined by approximately 45\u25e6 to the vertical, directed downwards\nand away from the umbra. The latter is consistent with the fact that the striations, when\nobserved near the limb, appear to propagate only away from the umbra.\nTo visualize the waves, Fig. 7 shows the temperature in vertical cuts through the\nfilament at the location indicated by the red line in Fig 2 at t = 11 and t = 16.5 min,\ncorresponding to two nearly opposite phases of the oscillations. The differences in the\ntemperature structure at the two phases is large in the top 200 km of the filament, indicating\nthat the oscillations are outside the linear regime.\nWe comment that the mode is global with respect to the penumbral filament, although\nthe filament has strong velocity, temperature and field gradients. For this reason we think\nit is dangerous to interpret the associated intensity fluctuations, such as those plotted in\nthe top left of Fig. 6, as simple tracers of the velocity field.\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nThere are numerous physical forces and processes which affect the oscillations. The\nperiod of 8 minutes (similar to the lifetime of granules) is long enough to make radiative\nprocesses important, the magnetic field is strong and structured, the flows are a significant\nfraction of the local sound speed and highly structured, whilst the density varies strongly\nacross the filament and with depth. We leave the difficult task of disentangling the various\nwaves and instabilities which could play a role to a future study.\n\n2.2.\n\nRound sunspots\n\nTo see if the oscillations found above are specific to penumbral filaments in the slab\ngeometry, we looked for similar features in the sunspot simulation described in Rempel\net al. (2009a); Rempel (2011). The simulation domain is periodic in both horizontal\ndirections (x and y), with dimensions of 98.304 Mm \u00d7 49.152 Mm, and has a vertical (z)\nextent of 6.144 Mm. The boundary conditions are identical to the slab simulation described\nabove. The setup of this simulation contains a pair of opposite polarity sunspots with\nabout 1.6 * 1022 Mx each and maximum field strengths of about 3 and 4 kG, respectively.\nThis setup leads to an extended penumbra in between both spots and we focus here our\ninvestigation on a part of the penumbra belonging to the (left side) for the 4 kG sunspot\n(see, e.g., Figs. 1 of Rempel et al. (2009a); Rempel (2011, see, e.g., Figs. 1 of)). This part\nof the penumbra is the most extended displaying long, well formed fibrils, which are shown\nin Fig. 8. A detailed analysis of this region was recently performed by Rempel (2011).\nThe spatial location of the space-time slices plotted in Fig. 9 is marked by the\nhorizontal line in Fig. 8. The time slices displayed in Fig. 9 are computed using a constant\ngeometrical height about 300 km beneath the quiet Sun \u03c4 = 1 level, which is below the local\n\u03c4 = 1 in bright filaments and above it in the dark filaments. The presence of oscillations in\nthis simulation is suggested by the typical asymmetric fishbone pattern, earlier detected in\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nthe slab simulation, most clearly visible in the filament at the position x = 9 Mm. This\nsuspicion is heightened by the clear oscillatory signal in the velocity perpendicular to the\nfilament. A more detailed view of the filaments located between x = 2.25 and x = 5.25 Mm\nas well as x = 8.1 and x = 9.9 Mm is shown in Figs. 10 and 11, respectively. Clearly,\nthis simulation also displays oscillations in several filaments in the innermost parts of the\npenumbra with periods around 7-8 minutes. The most significant difference compared to\nthe oscillations in the slab geometry is a substantially smaller horizontal displacement.\nWhile the slab simulation presented in Fig. 4 shows a lateral displacement of the filament\nwith an amplitude comparable to the width of the filament in all plotted variables, the\noscillations here occur within otherwise mostly unaffected flow channels. The oscillation\nis most prominent in the intensity and in the velocity component lateral to the filament.\nVariations in the magnetic field strength are mostly restricted to a narrow boundary layer\ncharacterized by enhanced horizontal and reduced vertical field strength. This boundary\nlayer coincides with the region of convective downflows at the edge of the filaments, as\nhas been shown in Rempel (2011, see Fig. 17 therein). The vertical flow velocity shows\nmoderate changes in the central upflows, but a rather intermittent behavior in the lateral\ndownflows. The average outflow velocity from filament has its largest amplitudes near the\nouter edge of the filaments, where we also find the strongest flow variations. They remain\nsmall compared to the mean flow velocity, however. Both, the radial magnetic field and\nradial outflow originate mostly from a thin boundary layer just below the \u03c4 = 1 level (see\nFig. 17 of Rempel 2011), where strong horizontal field is induced and the Evershed flow\nis driven. The horizontal field and accelerated fluid are transported downward by the\noverturning convection within the filament, leading in deeper layers to a filament structure\nwith enhancements of both radial magnetic field strength and flow velocity at the lateral\nboundaries of the filaments. The most significant difference between this simulation and the\npreviously discussed slab simulation is in terms of a substantially stronger Evershed flow\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nthat is accompanied with stronger horizontal field within flow channels: the flow velocity\nalong filaments reaches in most filaments 3 km/s, while the horizontal field strength remains\nof the order of 1.5 kG. The horizontal field enhances the stiffness in the direction along\nfilaments and thus suppresses lateral deformations. This could be taken as an indication\nthat the lateral displacement of the flow channel in Fig. 4 is more a consequence than a\ncause of the oscillation mode. Furthermore the substantial difference in flow velocity and\nfield strength does not seem to affect the oscillation period compared to the example shown\nin Fig. 4.\n\n3.\n\nObservations\n\nFor the present study we selected a time series of G-band (4305 \u00c5) images of a sunspot\nlocated almost at disk center and recorded by the Broadband Filter Imager (BFI) of the\nSolar Optical Telescope (SOT) onboard Hinode (Tsuneta et al. 2008). Such a location\ndiffers significantly from all previous studies of moving dark stripes in penumbral filaments,\nwhich were all carried out closer to the limb. The time series, recorded on January 5,\n2007, consists of 432 images at 30 s cadence and contains a sunspot (NOAA 10933) located\nat disk center. The spatial resolution in the G-band is approximately 0.00 22. The image\nscale is 0.00 054 per pixel. The Solar Soft pipelines for the Hinode SOT/BFI were used for\nflat field and dark current corrections. The images are reconstructed for the instrumental\nPSF, applying a Wiener filter (Sobotka et al. 1993) and assuming diffraction on an ideal\ncircular 50 cm aperture. Finally, a subsonic filter (Title et al. 1989) with a cut-off velocity\nof 6 km s\u22121 is used to filter out contributions of five-minute oscillations. The first and last\n14 images from the time series of January 5, 2007 have been omitted due to the apodizing\nwindow used in the subsonic filtering. The mean intensity of quiet regions (i.e., regions\ncontaining undisturbed granulation and an absence of bright points) close to the observed\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nsunspot were used for intensity normalization in all images.\n\n3.1.\n\nObservational analysis\n\nFigure 12 shows a G-band image of the sunspot at the beginning of the filtered time\nseries. A central umbra and a fully developed penumbra can be seen. Filaments oriented\nin all azimuthal directions clearly exhibit central dark cores. An animation of the analyzed\ntime series reveals a lateral motion of dark lanes in the filaments from the axis of a particular\nfilament toward either one of its edges, or toward both of its edges. These lateral motions\nare found in all azimuthal directions from the center of the sunspot. They are strongest at\nthe inner ends of the filaments, in particular in filaments that protrude into the umbra.\nTwo representative space-time diagrams are shown in Figs. 13 and 14, respectively.\nthey correspond to the lines 'S1' and 'S2' lying on opposite sides of the penumbra in Fig.\n12. The motion of thin dark stripes across some of the filaments is apparent as inclined\ndark stripes in Figs. 13 and 14.\nFigure 13 shows the space time diagram for the horizontal slit 'S1'. The white boxes\nindicate locations of filaments where inclined stripes or \"twists\" can be clearly seen. Only\nsome of the filaments show such stripes and only for a part of the time. In the panels on the\nright, each box is displayed two times, once simply to highlight the stripes, the second time\nwith white lines overplotted on the dark stripes for better visibility. Filament 'A', located\nat x = 19.00 5, shows a central dark core and dark stripes, from 0 to 20 min, pointing toward\nboth edges. The dark stripes in opposite directions occur alternatively, recalling from the\nspacing between asymmetric fishbone appearance already seen in the left panel of Fig. 4.\nThis pattern can also be seen for filament 'B' at x = 23.00 5 from 22 to 38 min. Filament\n'C' at x = 27.00 0 shows stripes in one direction only. Filament 'D' located at x = 23.00 0\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nshows dark stripes from 100 to 135 min also just in one direction, but opposite to 'C'. Such\n\"one-sided\" stripes may correspond to the weaker, asymmetric oscillations seen between 50\nand 90 min in the slab simulations (Fig. 3) and the leftmost filament located between 2.5\nto 3.0 Mm in Fig. 9 for the round spot.\nFigure 14 is a space-time plot along slit 'S2' depicted in Fig. 12. Filament 'E', located\nat x = 27.00 0, shows stripes in one direction from 30 to 75 min. Filament 'F' at x = 29.00 5\nshows an asymmetric fishbone pattern from 56 to 70 min. Figure 14 demonstrates that such\nstripes are not restricted to a single location and that, because the sunspot is nearly at disk\ncenter, opposite sides of the penumbra display essentially the same behavior (in a statistical\nsense). From these two images we estimate that the period of the observed oscillations is in\nthe range of 3 to 7 minutes.\nSpace-time diagrams along further lines (slits) cutting across filaments slits oriented\nperpendicular to S1 and S2 (e.g. at solar x = \u221222 and at +4 arc sec) were also produced\n(not shown). Similar stripes and patterns as shown in Figs. 13 and 14 can also be recognized\nthere, although slightly less clearly.\nIt is also instructive to consider space-time diagrams running along the filaments (i.e.\nalong slit S3 in Fig. 12), the observational analogy to that shown for the simulation in\nFig. 6. The oscillations we saw in Figs. 13 and 14 are also visible in Fig. 15. They can be\nclearly seen between y = \u221235 and y = \u221234 arsec between t = 0 and t = 30 as a stack\nof dark and white stripes, whose inclination to the horizontal indicates that the waves\nare propagating outwards from the umbra. However, it is also clear that oscillations and\npropagating waves are ubiquitous. In particular, on the opposite side of the umbra waves\n(now propagating in the opposite direction, i.e. still away from the umbra) are visible at\nmany locations. From this figure we can also determine that the wavelength along the\nfilament is about 500 km.\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\nNot only are moving stripes visible also at disk center and not just at the limb, but\nthey also move with roughly the same phase-speed (1.2-2.8 km s\u22121 ) and display roughly\nthe same periodicity (3-7 min) at disk center as they do closer to the limb. This observed\nvelocity is consistent with the apparent phase velocity inferred from the simulation, e.g.\n2 km s\u22121 for the slab geometry (see Section 2.1.1), although the period is somewhat larger\nin the simulations (possibly related to the subsonic filtering we applied to the observations),\ne.g. 8 min in the slab geometry and 7-8 min for the round sunspots.\n\n4.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe analyzed striations moving across bright penumbral filaments in both numerical\nsimulations and in a time series of seeing-free G-band images obtained with Hinode. In both\ncases we find that these moving striations, which give the filaments a twisting appearance,\nare also visible at disk center and appear relatively similar in simulations and observations.\nInterestingly, at disc center the two halves of a filament on either side of its centeral dark\ncore can display \"twists\" in opposite directions, with the stripes on the two sides being out\nof phase.\nTwo different numerical simulations indicate that the striations are oscillations\npropagating along the penumbral filaments directed away from the umbra and downward.\nThe periods of the oscillations one found to be 3-7 min from observations and 7-8 min in\nthe simulations. The explanation for the striations suggested by the simulations is quite\ndifferent from that proposed by Spruit et al. (2010) and, in particular does not support\ntheir conclusion that the striations imply the absence of a dynamically significant horizontal\nmagnetic field strength in bright penumbral filaments. The MHD simulations reproduce\nthe data rather well, although they have a rather dynamically significant horizontal field\nin the filaments. Although the Simulations with a stronger horizontal field (1500 G) in\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\nthe filaments produce oscillations with a smaller amplitude, they are still consistent with\nthe observations. These oscillations are potentially a new seismic diagnostic which can be\nused to better understand penumbral filaments. This would, however, require a physical\nunderstanding of the underlying oscillatory mode, which itself will require further study.\n\nThis work has been partly supported by the WCU grant No. R31-10016 funded by\nthe Korean Ministry of Education, Science and Technology.
