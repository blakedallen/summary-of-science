Introduction\nThe \u03bb Boo stars are a fascinating class of stars to which\nmuch attention has been devoted in the recent years. It\nis the only class of A-type stars with abundances lower\nthan solar, which however have all the kinematical and\nphotometric properties of Pop I stars. It is widely accepted\nthat their low metallicity cannot be ascribed to an age\neffect and is in fact unrelated to the chemical evolution of\nthe Galaxy.\nSeveral unsuccessful attempts have been made in the\npast to interpret this peculiar behaviour from the first historical theory of spallation reactions (Sargent, 1965) to the\nMichaud & Charland (1986) theory of diffusion/mass-loss\nthe weakness of which has been underlined by Baschek &\nSlettebak (1988) and examined in detail by Charbonneau\n(1993). These authors raised the critical problem of the\nthermally-driven meridional circulation generated by the\nrelatively rapid, when compared to that of Am stars, roSend offprint requests to: R. Faraggiana\n\u22c6\nBased on observations collected at ESO (Echelec spectrograph) and at TBL of the Pic du Midi Observatory (France)\nCorrespondence to: faraggiana@ts.astro.it\n\ntation of these stars. In \u03bb Boo stars a vigorous meridional\ncirculation should prevent diffusion to operate efficiently.\nThe best theory, at present, is based on the diffusionaccretion model proposed by Venn & Lambert (1990) to\nexplain the abundance anomalies of the three \u03bb Boo stars\nstudied by them. This hypothesis has been refined later on\nby Waters et al. (1992) and by Turcotte & Charbonneau\n(1993). The key point of these models is the existence\nof a surrounding disk of dust and gas which would be\nthe remnant of the star formation material. The gaseous\npart would be accreted by the star, while the dust would\nbe blown away by radiation pressure. According to this\ntheory the \u03bb Boo stars should be young objects, in the\nlast phases of their pre-main sequence life or in the early\nphases of the main-sequence. In fact it has been shown\nthat any remnant of the initial disk will be blown out\nin 106 yrs upon termination of accretion episode. It is in\nfact true that some \u03bb Boo stars have IR excess and/or\nshell signatures which could be explained by circumstellar\nmaterial still surrounding a very young star or system.\nAlso \u03bb Boo have been found to be non-radial pulsating\nobjects, which would agree with the hypothesis that they\nlie in the zone of pulsation instability.\n\n\f2\n\nR. Faraggiana et al.: \u03bb Boo stars with composite spectra\n\nThe hypothesis that the \u03bb Boo stars may be young\nobjects, has been explored by several authors since the\nfirst study by Gerbaldi et al. (1993), but it turned out not\nto be a general explanation for the \u03bb Boo stars. In fact it\nappears that they occupy a very large domain of the HR\ndiagram.\nA similar model in essence, but with an alternative\nscenario has been proposed by Kamp & Paunzen (2002)\nwhere the surrounding disk is replaced by a diffuse IS\ncloud crossed by the star. In such a model it is however\nunclear why such effects should be limited to the \u03bb Boo\nrange of Teff .\nThe objects classified as \u03bb Boo display a large variety of properties and a remarkable lack of any relation between their physical parameters (Teff , log g, v sin i,\nage, galactic coordinates) and the measured abundance\nanomalies. Recently bright companions were detected near\nseveral \u03bb Boo candidates by ground-based speckle and\nadaptive optics (AO) observations, as well as by the\nHipparcos space experiment. This situation prompted us\nto explore a new hypothesis to explain the \u03bb Boo phenomenon: a combination of two similar spectra can be\nconfused with that of a single metal poor star (Faraggiana\n& Bonifacio, 1999).\nIn previous papers on this subject we showed that composite spectra due to undetected binary stars may be easily confused with those of a single peculiar star classified\nas \u03bb Boo. In particular, from a detailed inspection of high\nresolution spectra of close binaries producing composite\nspectra, but classified as single peculiar stars belonging to\n\u03bb Boo class, we have selected some criteria that allow to\ndistinguish composite spectra (Faraggiana et al., 2001a) .\nThese criteria have been successfully used to demonstrate that other \u03bb Boo stars are in fact binaries which\ngive rise to composite spectra (Faraggiana et al., 2001a;\nFaraggiana et al., 2001b; Faraggiana & Gerbaldi, 2003).\nMore recently we have shown that a high percentage of \u03bb\nBoo candidates have visual and UV photometric properties (Gerbaldi et al., 2003) that are incompatible with the\n\u03bb Boo classification.\nWe are continuing our research aiming to select a\ngroup of spectra of metal-deficient Pop I A type noncontaminated by binarity.\nIn the present paper we recall in section 2 the previously defined binary detection criteria and clarify how\nthey are often complementary; we discuss, in section 3,\nthe new \u03bb Boo candidates which appear to be binaries\nwith the spectrum contaminated by that of a companion; in section 4 we discuss the \u03bb Boo candidates with\ncomposite spectra and in the conclusions we examine the\npossible relationship, if any, between duplicity and \u03bb Boo\nphenomenon.\n\n2. Binary stars producing composite spectra\n2.1. Duplicity detection by imaging: Hipparcos, speckle\ninterferometry, adaptive optics\nBinary systems detected by imaging are discussed in detail\nby Gerbaldi et al. (2003). The measure of separation and\nmagnitude difference allowed to recognize that 12 objects,\ncorresponding to 9% of the total, classified as \u03bb Boo, are\nin reality binaries that cannot be resolved at the spectrograph entrance. Their classification is based on the properties of the average spectrum of two stars of similar luminosity and spectral type; this combination in general\nproduces a spectrum affected by veiling, so that the metal\nlines appear weak and may mimic those formed in a single\nmetal deficient atmosphere.\n\n2.2. Duplicity detection from spectroscopic and\nphotometric data\nThe detection of duplicity is tricky since these objects\ndo not show, in general, the classical double peaked narrow lines as in most classical SB2. This is mainly due to\nthe fact that one of the characteristics of \u03bb Boo stars is\nthe mean-high v sin i which produces broad and shallow\nlines. The detection of possible duplicity is therefore more\npromising in the visual-red wavelength range where the\nblending is lower than at shorter wavelengths.\nThe OI triplet at 777.4 nm is not affected by any other\nline; the shape of the three components allows to distinguish the presence of a secondary set of lines if a companion of similar brightness at this wavelength is present;\nhowever this is true only up to v sin i \u2243 100 km s\u22121 ,\nvalue for which the 3 lines merge in one unique broad featureless line. This very powerful criterion has been used\nto recognize spectroscopically known binaries among the\nlower rotating \u03bb Boo candidates; an example is HD 47152\n(Faraggiana et al., 2001a).\nThe presence of a secondary component of very similar brightness and similar atmospheric parameters may\nbe easily detected by cross correlation using as template a\nsharp lined synthetic spectrum (broadened to 5 km s\u22121 ).\nAn example is that of HD 11413 discussed in the next section. However, the cross correlation does not always reveal\nthe presence of the companion star; this is the case when:\n1. the observed composite spectrum is detected by the\nsame asymmetry of many lines (as in the case of HD\n196821 discussed in section 3.4);\n2. the lines of the brighter component are much stronger\nthan those of the companion (as in HD 141851 discussed in section 3.3);\n3. the chosen spectral range includes a strong Balmer line\nwhose behaviour dominates in the cross correlation 1 .\n1\nthis last limitation can be overcome by suppressing the\nBalmer line profile in both the observed and the template spectra, as it has been done for HD 11413, HD 79108 and HD\n210111 discussed in next sections.\n\n\fR. Faraggiana et al.: \u03bb Boo stars with composite spectra\n\nThe core of Balmer lines should be deeper than that\nof the synthetic spectra computed with the LTE approximation, as are those computed with the SYNTHE code\n(Kurucz, 1993) used by us; a flat and square inner core\nprofile is a sign of a probable duplicity (Faraggiana &\nBonifacio, 1999).\nOther more subtle signatures of duplicity are the inconsistent results obtained when abundance analysis is attempted. This is what we have experienced, for example,\nwith the known binary HD 47152, when we tried to fit its\nspectrum with that computed by using the model based\non the parameters derived from the calibration of photometric colour indices. In this case the observed Balmer line\nwings are roughly fitted by LTE computations, but metal\nlines, in particular the many Fe I and Fe II lines do not\nrespect the ionization equilibrium. Moreover the comparison with computations indicates that while some profiles\nare fitted by computations, for others the computed lines\nappear to be either too strong or too weak.\nIn some cases, subtle duplicity signatures can be detected when several spectra are available, because the effect of the companion is different at different phases (e.g.\nHD 11413 and HD 210111 discussed in the following sections).\nThe presence of two sets of lines with different broadening as in the case of HD 111786 visual spectrum\n(Faraggiana et al., 1997) is also a sign of a composite spectrum. This fact, coupled with the absence of any narrow\nline component in the UV range (HR IUE spectra) allowed\nus to deduce that the narrow lines are due to a secondary\nsource cooler than the primary. We point out that such\nnarrow lines cannot be interpreted as due to a circumstellar shell, since shell lines have a different behaviour: the\npresence of a shell produces narrow components mainly of\nthe resonance lines and of some low excitation lines and\nare not restricted to a limited wavelength range. This is\nthe case of HD 38545 (Faraggiana et al., 2001a), for which\nstrong shell lines are seen both in the visual and in the\nUV spectrum; the binary nature of this object has been\ndiscovered by Hipparcos and, on the basis of the spectra at our disposal, we have been unable to decide if the\nshell is surrounding one of the binary system component\nor the whole system. In fact the broad photospheric lines\nprevent the spectral detection of duplicity from spectrum\ninspection.\nLarge inconsistencies between the atmospheric parameters derived from calibration of visual photometric colour\nindices and the UV flux distribution, discussed in Gerbaldi\net al. (2003) paper for the stars observed by TD1, are also\nsigns that the star is not a classical \u03bb Boo.\n\n3\n\nTable 2.

The basic data for these stars are given in\nTable 1, together with the observational data and some\ninstrumental details.\nThe wavelength coverage of the spectra taken at ESO\nwith the Echelec spectrograph is 421-450 nm since only the\n9 central orders have been extracted. The nominal spectral\nresolution of 70000 was degraded to 28000 by using a slit\nwidth of 320 \u03bc (1.5 arcsec on the sky). The reduction from\nthe CCD images to the complete linear spectra (calibration frames, orders extraction, subtraction of background\nintensity and scattered light, wavelength calibration and\nconnection of the orders) has been done with a package\nwhich runs under MIDAS and was developed expressly\nfor this spectrograph's data. The details of all the steps of\nthe procedure are described in Burnage & Gerbaldi (1990,\n1992).\nThe spectra taken at TBL with the Musicos spectrograph cover the wavelength range 515-889 nm. This is a\nfiber-fed spectrograph and its resolution is determined by\nthe 50 \u03bc fiber corresponding to 2.1 arcsec on the sky which\nyield R=32000. The photometric and wavelength reductions have been made by using ESpRIT (Echelle spectra\nReduction: an Interactive Tool), a computer code for online processing developed by Donati et al. (1997) and made\navailable at the TBL telescope of the Pic du Midi.\nThe atmospheric parameters derived from the\nStr\u00f6mgren and Geneva colour indices, as described in\nGerbaldi et al. (2003), are given in Table 2; these parameters are derived under the hypothesis that the objects are\nsingle stars and cannot be used for a reliable abundance\ndetermination.\nThe synthetic spectra used in next sections have been\ncomputed by using the Kurucz model atmosphere grid and\nSYNTHE code (Kurucz, 1993).\n\nThe target stars are extracted from the list of \u03bb Boo stars\ncompiled by Gerbaldi et al. (2003); this list contains all the\nstars that have been classified as members of this class and\nfor each of them the reference to the classifier(s) is given.\n\nThe validity of Moon and Dworetsky (1985) (MD) and\nK\u00fcnzli et al.

HD 11413\nThis is one of the few stars unanimously classified as \u03bb\nBoo (Abt & Morrell, 1995; Gray, 1988; Paunzen et al.,\n1997; Paunzen, 2001). Abundances for this star have been\ndiscussed in several papers and are all based on the hypothesis that this is a single star. The star is an unsolved\nvariable (U) according to Hipparcos data and variable of\n\u03b4 Sct type according to Adelman et al. (2000). The spectra used in the present paper have been already used by\nGrenier et al. (1999) for precise RV measures and the\nstar was classified in that paper as probable double. We\nmade a finer check for duplicity correlating the spectra\nwith the synthetic spectrum computed with the parameters obtained from uvby\u03b2 photometry calibration and a\nlow value of v sin i (5 km s\u22121 ). Due to the predominant\nr\u00f4le of the H\u03b3 line in the 300 \u00c5 range covered by our\nspectra and to the possible inaccuracy of the continuum\ndrawing through such a broad line in dwarf A-type stars\nwhich covers 3 orders of the echelle spectrograph, we artificially suppress H\u03b3 by normalizing with a cubic spline\nthrough the line profile, both on observed and computed\nspectra before performing the cross-correlation.\nThe cross correlation program rebins the observed and\nthe template in the velocity space, the rebinning is largely\noversampled; the correlation index is normalized to 1 and\nin the abscissa the RV is given.\nThe cross correlations (Fig. 1 ) indicate clearly that\nthe spectrum is formed by more than a single source. This\nis more evident for the HD 11413 spectrum taken on 1993,\nSep 9th, where a separation of about 48 km s\u22121 between\nthe two components has been measured. The existence of\na third body may be suspected from the shape of the cross\ncorrelation of the spectrum taken on 1992, Nov 16th (left\nwing).\n\ndate\n16 Nov. 1992\n09 Sep. 1993\n15 Jan. 1995\n04 Apr. 1993\n07 Apr. 1993\n20 Mar. 2000\n06 Oct. 2002\n07 Sep. 1993\n18 Sep. 1994\n14 Nov. 1994\n\nexp.time (mn)\n50\n50\n55\n33\n30\n60\n120\n120\n90\n55\n\n17 Feb. 2003\n\n60\n\nIn order to allow the reader to see what the crosscorrelation of a star with a non-composite spectrum looks\nlike, in the bottom panel of Fig. 1 we show the cross correlation of an H\u03b3 suppressed spectrum of Sirius, with an\nappropriate synthetic spectrum. The normalized peak is\nsymmetric and its height is almost 0.8. Sirius is a known\nbinary in which the secondary is a white dwarf, therefore much fainter and its spectrum is not composite. The\ndifference between this cross correlation and those of HD\n11413 is striking.\nHD 11413 belongs to the group of pulsating \u03bb Boo and\nthe detailed analysis of its pulsation characteristics has\nbeen made by Koen et al. (2003); this allows to study the\nimpact of pulsations on the spectra analyzed here. These\nauthors have shown that no line profile changes have been\ndetected in the 3 days covered by their observations made\nwith R=39000, higher than that of the spectra used by\nus. Having taken a large series of spectra with very short\nexposures (240 to 500 s) these authors have been able\nto measure the RV variations connected with pulsations.\nFigure 2 of Koen et al. shows that the amplitude of these\nRV is 3 km s\u22121 .\nThe RV difference between the two peaks found in\nthe correlation of our spectrum of HD 11413 taken on\nSeptember 9th 1993 is almost one order of magnitude\nhigher. It cannot be due to the star pulsation; we also recall that our spectra, taken with 50m of exposure, average\nthe complex pulsation period (about 0.04 d), so reducing\nthe visibility of NRP.\nThe comparison between observations and computations shows a poor agreement with the synthetic spectra\ncomputed both with the parameters derived from uvby\u03b2\nor Geneva photometries.\nThe v sin i derived by Royer et al. (2001) from the\nfrequency of the first zero of the Fourier transform of 3\nlines of these same spectra is 140 km s\u22121 , a value slightly\nhigher than those measured by St\u00fcrenburg (1993) (125\nkm s\u22121 ) and by Holweger & Rentzsch-Holm (1995) (122\nkm s\u22121 ). These latter authors derived v sin i from the CaII\n\n\fR. Faraggiana et al.: \u03bb Boo stars with composite spectra\n\n5\n\nFig. 2. The H\u03b3 profile of HD 79108 compared with a\nspectrum computed with Teff = 9830 K, log = 4.07 and\nv sin i =160 km s\u22121 .\nwhere the overlap of H\u01eb and H8 broad wings prevent to\nsee the real continuum.\nSo HD 11413 is a new SB2 or multiple star and it is another example of peculiar hydrogen line (PHL), common\namong \u03bb Boo stars, which is explained by the duplicity of\nthe object.\n\n3.2. HD 79108\n\nFig. 1. Panel a):the cross correlation of the spectrum\nof HD 11413 taken on Nov 16th, 1992 with a computed\nspectrum (Teff = 7950K, log g = 3.84, v sin i = 5 km s\u22121\n) over the range 420-450nm. In both spectra the H\u03b3 has\nbeen artificially suppressed (see text). Panel b):The cross\ncorrelation of the spectrum of HD 11413 taken on Sep.\n9th, 1993 with the same computed spectrum as used in\npanel b); also the spectral range is the same and H\u03b3 has\nbeen likewise suppressed. Panel c): the cross correlation\nof the spectrum of Sirius; with a (Teff = 9830 K, log g =\n4.07, v sin i = 5 km s\u22121 ) suitable synthetic spectrum, the\nspectral range is the same and H\u03b3 has been suppressed as\nfor HD 11413.\n\nThe star is a \u03bb Boo candidate having a slightly negative\n\u2206a index (Maitzen & Pavlovski, 1989; Vogt et al., 1998);\nit has also been classified \u03bb Boo by Abt & Morrell (1995).\nKing (1994) has derived an IR excess at 60 \u03bcm from IRAS\ndata. Grenier et al. (1999) classified it as suspected double, but speckle interferometric observations (Ebersberger\net al., 1986) gave a negative result. Its RV is variable according to the Bright Star Catalog in spite of the fact that\nthe star does not belong to a known binary system. The\nH\u03b3 profile is fitted by the spectrum computed with the\nMD parameters (Fig. 2); however the observed core is not\ndeeper than the computed one, as expected (see section\n2.2). The metal lines have square and asymmetric profiles\nsuggesting a composite spectrum. The cross correlation\nmade without H\u03b3 , as for HD 11413, confirms that the object is in reality a complex system composed by at least\ntwo stars of similar luminosity and a third less luminous\ncomponent (Fig. 3).\n\n3.3. HD 141851\nK line profile; the discrepancy between this value and that\nderived from the metal lines in the 420\u2013450 nm region\nis likely due to the fact that it is almost impossible to\nnormalize correctly the observed spectrum in this region\n\nThis star has been classified \u03bb Boo candidate by Abt\n(1984) on the basis of the weak MgII 448.1nm line; the\ncolour indices in the Geneva photometric system support\nthis classification (Hauck, 1986). The star is included in\n\n\f6\n\nR. Faraggiana et al.: \u03bb Boo stars with composite spectra\n\nFig. 3. The cross correlation of the spectrum of HD 79108\nwith the synthetic spectrum computed with Teff = 9830 K,\nlog = 4.07 and v sin i = 5 km s\u22121 and with H\u03b3 suppressed\n(see text).\n\nFig. 5. The observed Mg I triplet of HD 141851 compared\nwith two synthetic spectra: that computed with MD parameters (dotted line) and that obtained from the combination described in the text (long dashed line).\n\nthe Paunzen et al. (1997) \"consolidated catalogue of \u03bb\nBoo stars\", but not in the list of \"confirmed members\" of\nthis group by Paunzen (2001). The star is a known binary,\nfirst found by McAlister et al. (1987) through their speckle\nmeasures; the separation varies from 0.069 to 0.132 arcsec\n(Hartkopf et al., 2003), but no estimate of the magnitude\ndifference is given by these authors. However, the orbital\nperiod seems to be very long, probably of more than 60\nyr, according to Iliev et al. (2001).\nAccording to the spectrum analyzed by Grenier et al.\n(1999) the star belongs to the group of certain double A-F\ntype with faint F-G component, i.e. the observed spectrum\nappears to be significantly contaminated by that of the\nfainter and cooler companion. AO observations (Gerbaldi\net al., 2003) have demonstrated that the flux of the secondary star, is about 1/3 of that of the primary in the H\nfilter and cannot be neglected.\nThe v sin i values found in the literature are quite diverse: 185 km s\u22121 (Abt & Morrell, 1995), 230 km s\u22121\n(Royer, 2001), 200 km s\u22121 for C lines and 280 km s\u22121 for\nO lines (Paunzen et al., 1999a), 260 km s\u22121 (Andrievsky\net al., 2002). None of these authors mentions the presence\nof weak narrow lines all along the spectrum.\nThis star belongs to the sample of \u03bb Boo for which\nPaunzen et al. (1999a) and Kamp et al. (2001) determined\nNLTE abundances of C, O and Ca in LTE respectively by\nusing the average parameters of the two system components. In 2002 Andrievsky et al. made a new LTE abundance determination of C, O, Si and Fe; they adopted the\nsame model as the previous authors. Abundance differences with the results obtained by the previous authors\nappears for C and O. In Paunzen et al (1999a) the given\nLTE abundance of C is -0.73 (NLTE=-0.81) to be com-\n\npared to the value by Andrievsky et al. : -0.20; in the same\npaper the LTE abundance of O is +0.25 (NLTE=-0.21) to\nbe compared to the value by Andrievsky et al : -0.38.\nThe LTE abundance difference of C is considerably\nlarger than what a state of the art abundance analysis\nshould provide; they are based on different lines, so probably differently affected by NLTE. The wavelength of the\nlines used by Andrievsky et al is not specified so no abundance correction for NLTE can be estimated. Another possible interpretation of these different abundances is that\nthe two groups used spectra taken at different dates, so\nprobably at different phases of the binary system.\nHauck et al. (1998) measured the EW (2.3 m\u00c5) of\na narrow component in the core of the K-line; they interpreted it as a signature of circumstellar matter around the\nstar. This narrow feature may be interpreted more simply\nas the the spectral signature of the cooler companion.\nAn X-Ray emission, unexpected in early-, middle-Atype stars has been measured by ROSAT PSPC, and correctly ascribed to the companion star (Simon et al. 1995).\nIn fact, if one component of this system has a Tef f lower\nthan 8000 K, and thus a convective envelope from which\nX-Rays may originate, the detection of the X-Ray emission from the system does not present any peculiarity.\nWe note that what seems high noise of the spectrum\nof this star are, in reality, many weak lines of a component\nwith a lower Teff and a much lower v sin i (\u2264 20 km s\u22121 ).\nAccording to our spectra, the lines of the secondary\ncomponent are weak, but definitely present in the blue\nregion of the spectrum and more clearly from the Na I\ndoublet.\nThe observed colour indices have been used in both\nphotometries to derive the atmospheric parameters; in fact\n\n\fR. Faraggiana et al.: \u03bb Boo stars with composite spectra\n\n7\n\nFig. 4. The observed spectrum of HD 141851 (solid line) superimposed on the combined spectrum (short dashed\nline) obtained by combining two synthetic spectra as described in the text (upper panel). In the lower panel the same\nobserved spectrum is compared with two synthetic spectra computed with solar abundances and parameters Teff and\nlog g derived from the photometry: 8080 K, 3.86 (long dashed line) and 8258 K, 3.69 (dotted line); the two computed\nspectra are almost identical as can be seen in the inset.\nE(b-y)=-0.010 (computed by the program of Moon, 1985).\nThis slightly negative colour index may be considered as\ndue both to the errors on the photometric measurements\nand to a distorted flux due to the composite spectrum.\nPenprase (1993) gives E(B-V)=0.07 which corresponds to\nE(b-y)=0.05. According to the distance of HD 141851 obtained from Hipparcos data, combined to the study of\nthe high galactic latitude molecular clouds by Penprase\n(1993), such a large reddening seems improbable. We remind that E(B-V) has been derived by combining two photometric systems as well as the spectral classification of\nthe star (Penprase, 1992).\nWe computed two synthetic spectra with the parameters Teff and log g derived from uvby\u03b2 and Geneva photometric colour indices as listed in Table 2, namely, (8080 K,\n3.86), and (8258 K, 3.69). We assumed vsini = 250 km s\u22121\nfrom Royer (2001) and used solar abundances models.\nIn Fig. 4 the observations of the H\u03b1 region are overimposed on these two computed spectra. This comparison\nclearly shows:\n1. the difference of Teff and log g computed by MD and\nK\u00fcnzly et al. calibrations are such that the two different combinations produce the same Balmer line profiles\n2. the flat core of the observed H\u03b1 (and H\u03b3 ) profile, with\nrespect to the computed one, is one of the binary signatures according to Faraggiana et al. (2001a), while\nthe narrow core component belongs to the companion\nstar.\nThe aspect of the observed spectrum, the value of Teff\nobtained from the combined light, the magnitude differ-\n\nence in the H-band (Gerbaldi et al., 2003) and the analysis\nby Grenier et al. (1999) allow us to derive, as a starting\nguess, a combination of two spectra having Teff = 8000 and\n6000 K, log g = 4.0. The luminosity ratio in V has been\ncomputed from the absolute magnitudes MH and MV as\ngiven in the Allen's astrophysical quantities (Cox, 2000)\nfor dwarf stars A7 and G0 which correspond to the two\nTeff values. The MH values of these spectral types are coherent with the luminosity ratio observed in AO. For the\nV magnitude, it follows that the ratio of the luminosity in\nthis spectral domain is L1 /Ltot =0.84 and L2 /Ltot =0.16.\nThis combined spectrum gives a better fit to the observation (Fig. 4 and 5), but still not in a satisfactory way.\nWe only conclude that this is another star for which\nthe claimed metal deficiency cannot be investigated if the\nduplicity of the system is not taken into account.\n\n3.4. HD 196821\nVarious classifications of this star (classified as variable in\nthe SIMBAD database) appear in the literature: magnetic\nstar according to Wolff & Preston (1978) who measured\nv sin i =20 km s\u22121 ; Ap of the Si-Cr group according to\nHeacox (1979); B9-HgMn in the Renson et al. (1991) catalogue of Ap stars, \u03bb Boo according to Abt & Morrell (1995)\nwho measured v sin i =10 km s\u22121 . A positive value of \u2206a\n(+0.014) is observed by Maitzen et al. (1998), contrary\nto what is expected in \u03bb Boo stars (Maitzen & Pavlovski,\n1989).\nThe high blanketing, characteristic of CP stars and opposite to what is expected in \u03bb Boo stars is the cause of the\nUV flux distribution shown in Fig. 6. In fact the UV flux\n\n\f8\n\nR. Faraggiana et al.: \u03bb Boo stars with composite spectra\n\nFig. 6. The UV flux (and associated error bars) of HD\n196821 measured by TD1 compared to the theoretical flux\n(dash-dot line) computed with solar abundances.\nobserved by TD1 indicates that the blanketing is higher\nthan that predicted for a star with solar abundances, so\nexcluding that HD 196821 is a \u03bb Boo star.\nIn this figure the 4 observed magnitudes are derived\nfrom the absolute fluxes in four passbands centered at\n274.0, 236.5, 196.5 and 156.5 nm. The computed magnitudes are derived from the theoretical Kurucz fluxes integrated over the profile of the photometer channel passband (for the magnitude centered at 274.0) and over the\nresponse of each of the three spectrophotometer channels\n(135.0-175.0, 175.0-215.0, 215.0-255.0). These profiles are\ngiven in the Thompson et al. (1978) catalogue. The revised version, available at CDS, of this catalogue has been\nused to compute the UV magnitudes and their errors.\nThe only abundance analysis is that made by Heacox\n(1979) and it is based on Teff = 10400 K, log g = 3.7, \u03be=3\nkm s\u22121 and v sin i =20 km s\u22121 .\nIn his classification Bidelman (1988): notes \"rather odd\nspectrum; Ap Cr?, SB?\". In fact, the inspection of the\nspectrum taken on 2002, Oct 6 confirms that HD 196821\nis an SB; the presence of a companion star is revealed by\nthe same kind of asymmetry of the strong lines; the profile\nof the O I triplet is given in Fig. 7 to illustrate the shape of\nthe observed lines, which should be unblended in a single\nstar.\n\n3.5. HD 210111\nIn their RV program Grenier et al. (1999) classified the\nstar as probable double.\nThe duplicity of this star is suggested by the asymmetric and distorted profiles shown in figures 1 and 3 of\nHolweger & St\u00fcrenburg (1991) paper, especially for the\nNaI doublet, for the Mult. 4 Fe I lines 392.026, 392.2914,\n392.7922 and 393.0299 nm and for Al I 394.4009. The same\ndouble structure of Na I is evident in the average spectrum (of 5 spectra taken in 50 mn of observations) given\nby Bohlender et al. (1999) in their figure 9. Bohlender et\nal. (1999) in their study of non-radial pulsation (NRP)\nof \u03bb Boo stars underline that this object has the largest\namplitude NRP ever observed in dwarf stars of any class.\n\nFig. 7. The OI 777.4 triplet of HD 196821 compared to the\ntheoretical spectrum computed by assuming solar abundances.\nBohlender et al. report a peak to peak amplitude of 3% of\nthe continuum in the mean-absolute-deviation spectrum\n(MAD). These authors do not report any radial velocity variations, which, as in all non radial modes, must be\nsmall. One may estimate the amplitude of radial velocity\nvariation in km s\u22121 by multiplying by a factor of 100 the\namplitude in the MAD (Mantegazza, private communication), we thus expect radial velocity variations with an\namplitude of the order of 3 km s\u22121 . The multiperiodic\nhigh amplitude NRP is amply documented by these authors. The cross-correlations computed with the 3 spectra\nobtained by us are shown in Fig. 8. The asymmetry of our\ncorrelation curves refers to spectra of 1h-2h of exposure;\nthe largest amplitude of the NRP measured by Bohlender\nhas a period of 49 minutes, so the effect of NRP has been\naveraged on these spectra. Nevertheless the RV between\nthe two deformed peaks of the cross correlation is more\nthan 20 km s\u22121 , which cannot be confused with the radial velocity variations induced by the NRP, which are an\norder of magnitude smaller. Our results combined with\nBohlender et al. (1999) remarks suggest that HD 210111\nis probably a combination of two similar NRP stars.\nThe TD1 observations suggest a flux deficiency in the\nband 156.5 nm compared with the others (Fig. 9) that, if\nconfirmed, indicates that the companion star has a lower\nTeff .\n\n3.6. HD 149303: wrong binary detection ?\nThis star is a binary according to Paunzen et al. (1999a)\nfrom the profile of the O I triplet; one component being\na low rotating star and the other one a fast rotator. In\nspite of this duplicity detection, the abundances of O, N,\nand S have been determined by these authors and by and\n\n\fR. Faraggiana et al.: \u03bb Boo stars with composite spectra\n\nFig. 8.

Both\nin the synthetic and observed spectra the H\u03b3 has been\nartificially suppressed (see text).\n\nFig. 9.

(1993).\nThe v sin i = 275 km s\u22121 has been derived also, in the\nhypothesis that the spectrum is that of a single object.\nIn another paper Paunzen et al. (1999b) determined\nLTE abundances of Mg, Ti, Fe and Ni using totally different values for Teff and log g (9000 K and 4.2) derived\nfrom another calibration of photometric data ( (b-y)-c1 by\nKurucz (1991)). The value of v sin i (200 km s\u22121 ) derived\n\n9\n\nin this paper is also very different from the previous one.\nWe note here that the (b-y) colour is inconsistent with the\n\u03b2 value; in fact this latter predicted from the other stellar\ncolours is 2.875 instead of the observed value of 2.848. It\ndoes seem a bit odd that abundances of different elements\nare derived using so different atmospheric parameters.\nThe Teff values that we have derived from the uvby\u03b2\nand Geneva colour indices are 8120 and 8483 K, and none\nof them agree with the H\u03b1 profile. The star is the A component of a visual binary system; the E(b-y) computed for\nits B companion is 0.031, while E(b-y)=-0.018 has been\nderived for the primary. By forcing the star in another MD\ngroup (gr 5), the consistent E(b-y)= 0.023 is obtained for\nboth; however the Teff computed in that case is 9520 K\n(log g = 3.85) which also does not fit the observed H\u03b1\nprofile and is in strong contradiction with the UV flux\nobserved by IUE.\nThe complex structure of the OI 777.4 triplet claimed\nby Paunzen et al. (1999a) is not present on our spectrum,\nwhich simply indicates a very fast rotator (Fig. 10).\nEven the Na I doublet (Fig. 11) is merged in a single\nfeature with the central spurious \"subrotational\" peak due\nto the doublet convolution (see comments on this effect in\nDravins et al., 1990).\nIt might be interesting to follow this star to recover the\nphase at which the low-rotating companion is detectable.\nIf this object, as one single star or as the fast rotating\ncomponent of a binary system, is really rotating at v sin i\n=275 km s\u22121 , it should have lost its spherical shape and\nthe gravity-darkening effect cannot be neglected. The effects of such a rotation on the stellar continuum and on\nEW of lines should be analyzed. Clearly this analysis cannot be done on a single spectrum of low S/N ratio such\nas the one at our disposal. We have only checked that\nthe H\u03b1 profile is not fitted by those computed by adopting the models with the parameters derived by Str\u00f6mgren\nand Geneva photometries; these models cannot be used\nfor abundance analyses. According to our interpretation,\nit is highly probable that the extremely high v sin i value\nis in reality a combination of those of two mean-fast rotating stars whose average parameters do not reproduce\nthe H\u03b1 profile because the stars are not equal.\nThe Referee suggested that the visual companion of\nHD 149303, whose separation has been measured by\nHipparcos (parallax=14.48 mas, sep=16.\u2032\u2032 36 , \u2206Hp =3.08)\nmay have been in the spectrograph slit during the Paunzen\net al. observations and not during those presented here.\nThe presence of the low vsini component has been discovered by Paunzen et al. (1999a) on the OI triplet on spectra\ntaken during 1996-1998 (no dates are given for these observations). The epoch of the Hipparcos catalogue is 1991.25,\nthus in order to be within the slit width of Paunzen et al.\n(which must have been of a few arcseconds, at most) the\nB component should have moved in less than 7 yrs at\nleast 15 arcsec to be confused with its brighter companion; its tangent velocity would be 701.5 km/s. Whichever\nthe orbit inclination the system cannot be bound and one\nshould admit that the companion star is moving on an\n\n\f10\n\nR. Faraggiana et al.: \u03bb Boo stars with composite spectra\n\nFig. 10. The OI 777.4 profile of HD 149303 compared\nwith that computed in the hypothesis that the star is a\nsingle object rotating at 275 km s\u22121 ; the fictious fit has\nbeen obtained by adopting the MD parameters, but increasing the oxygen abundance by 1 dex to simulate the\nNLTE effect on this triplet\nhyperbolic orbit, this is highly unlikely and can be dismissed. Therefore the hypothesis that this star was within\nthe width of Paunzen's slit can be rejected. We have also\nchecked on DSS II IR image taken on 1997.35 that the B\ncompanion was, at that date, at a distance of about 17\narcsec and therefore could not be in the Paunzen et al.\nslit width.\nAn alternative hypothesis is that the companion star\nwas within the height of the slit, which in fact may be quite\nlong. However the spectra of the two stars should have\nbeen clearly separated in the focal plane, unless the instrument had a scale of \u223c 6\u2032\u2032 per pixel. Therefore Paunzen\net al. should have been able to extract an uncontaminated\nspectrum of the primary star. Thus the secondary star\nseen by Paunzen cannot be the one seen by Hipparcos,\nbut must be one which is much closer.\nWe recall also that speckle measures by McAlister et\nal. (1997) gave a negative result for a nearby companion\nwith an upper limit for the separation \u2264 0.038 arcsec.\nFinally we recall that the known secondary with a magnitude difference of 3.08 corresponding to a flux ratio of\nless than 0.06 can hardly affect the spectrum of the primary star.\n\n4. Discussion\nThe very diverse properties of the stars classified as \u03bb Boo\nprompted us (Faraggiana & Bonifacio , 1999) to consider\nthe hypothesis that the peculiarities in many, if not all,\n\u03bb Boo stars result from the fact that they are unresolved\nbinary or multiple systems consisting of stars of similar\n\nFig. 11. The NaI doublet appears as a single very broad\nfeature in the spectrum of HD 149303 (thick line); the\nsynthetic spectrum has been computed by assuming that\nthe star is a single object rotating at 275 km s\u22121 . The convolution of such broad lines produces the fictious central\npeak.\n\nluminosity. In this paper we have examined the extensive\nlist of Gerbaldi et al. (2003) to see how many of the 136\nobjects classified as \u03bb Boo stars show composite spectra\nwhich, if interpreted as spectra of a single star, may be\nresponsible of the peculiarities which led to the \u03bb Boo\nclassification.\nFour stars in Gerbaldi et al. (2003) are misclassified\nbeyond any reasonable doubt: HD 34787, is a peculiar shell\nstar with strong SrII 4077 and no shell core of Balmer lines\n(Gray et al. (2001), HD 37886 is a Hg-Mn star, HD 89353\n(HR4049) is an extremely iron deficient post-AGB star,\nHD 108283 is a shell star. Therefore the \u03bb Boo candidates\nto be considered are 132.\nOne has to bear in mind the difference between binary\nsystems in which one of the companions is several magnitudes fainter than the other (as is the case for, e.g., many\nAm stars) and binary systems which give rise to composite spectra. Let us summarize all the stars for which the\npresence of a composite spectrum is either sure or highly\nprobable.\n\n4.1. Stars classified as \u03bb Boo with composite spectra\nWe consider as binaries which surely produce composite spectra those for which a separation between the\ncomponents of less than 2 arcsec has been measured\nwith a magnitude difference not larger than 2.2 mag.\nTwelve systems satisfy these criteria: 9 systems detected\nby Hipparcos (HD 22470, HD 36496, HD 38545, HD\n47152, HD 97773, HD 118623, HD 170000, HD 217782 and\n\n\fR. Faraggiana et al.: \u03bb Boo stars with composite spectra\n\nHD 220278); 2 systems in the WDS (Washington Double\nStar) Catalog (Worley & Douglass, 1997) (HD 160928 and\nHD 290492); 1 star measured with adaptive optics (HD\n141851) (Gerbaldi et al., 2003).\nIn addition to the stars for which high angular resolution observations have detected the duplicity and allowed to measure the separation, we must consider those\nstars for which a detailed inspection of high resolution spectra revealed the composite spectrum: HD 64491\n(Faraggiana & Gerbaldi, 2003), HD 111786 (Faraggiana\net al., 2001a), HD 153808 (Faraggiana et al., 2001a), HD\n174005 (Faraggiana et al., 2001b), as well as the four stars\ndiscussed in the previous sections (HD 11413, HD 79108,\nHD 196821 and HD 210111).\nTo the list of stars with composite spectra two known\nbinary systems must be added: the SB2 HD 210418 (Gray\n& Garrison 1987) and HD 98353; this latter star, better\nknown as 55 UMa is a triple system formed by a close pair\n(A1V and A2V, both moderately Am) and a more distant\ncomponent (A1V); it is discussed in detail by Liu et al.\n(1997).\nIt thus appears that the percentage of binaries in our\nsample, whose angular separation and magnitude difference produce composite spectra because not resolved on\na spectrograph entrance, is 22 out of 132, i.e. of the order of 17%, therefore not as small as assumed by people\ndiscussing the origin of these stars.\n\n4.2. Stars classified as \u03bb Boo which likely display\ncomposite spectra\nThe above percentage could be higher, if a few of the below listed stars, for which a composite spectrum can be\nsuspected, can be confirmed as composite spectrum stars.\nStars for which speckle interferometry measured a separation less than 0.1 arcsec, but for which there are no\nindications on the magnitude difference (HD 21335, HD\n98353, HD 225218) may be suspected of producing composite spectra, but require complementary observations\nto assess whether their spectra are composite indeed. HD\n98353=55 UMa is a case for which such observations are\navailable and it is in fact the triple system discussed above.\nOther binary candidates which may produce composite spectra are the 14 stars with variable RV, not belonging\nto known visual or spectroscopic binary systems, already\nlisted in Gerbaldi et al. (2003): HD 39283, HD 56405, HD\n74873, HD 79108, HD 87696, HD 111604, HD 125489, HD\n138527, HD 169009, HD 177756, HD 179791, HD 183324,\nHD 220061, HD 221756. A faint companion of HD 138527\nhas been detected by adaptive optics (Gerbaldi et al.,\n2003). Although other phenomena, such as, e.g., stellar\npulsations, may be responsible for variable radial velocities, it is likely that several of these turn out to be spectroscopic binaries. In fact among these HD 79108 is the new\nmultiple system discussed in section 3.2. For two others,\nHD 56405 and HD 125489, the UV flux (TD1 UV magnitudes), is lower than that computed with solar abun-\n\n11\n\ndances, contrary to what is expected in the low-blanketed\n\u03bb Boo stars (see Gerbaldi et al., 2003). We consider this\nan indication of composite spectra. In fact 5 out of the 8\nstars showing this low UV flux are already known to be\nclose binaries producing composite spectra, the remaining\nthree are the two above stars and HD 212150. For 4 of the\nvariable RV stars the UV flux is better fitted by theoretical\nfluxes computed assuming a solar abundance than lower\nthan solar abundances, as should be the case for \u03bb Boo\nstars (HD 39283, HD 74873, HD 87696 and HD 179791).\nAgain this is a reason to suspect a composite spectrum.\nA further reason to suspect the existence of composite\nspectra is the discrepancy between the absolute magnitude\nderived from the measured parallax and that derived from\nsome calibration of photometric indices. From the comparison between the absolute magnitude derived from the\nHipparcos parallax and the calibrations adopted by Moon\n(1985), a slight systematic difference esists, in the sense\nthat, on average, the Mv derived from the Hipparcos parallax is brighter than that derived from the Moon (1985)\ncalibrations. It is probably significant that the majority of\nthe known binary stars appear over-luminous with respect\nto what expected from colours ( see figure 4 in Gerbaldi et\nal. (2003)). This is not always the case, for some stars the\nHipparcos absolute magnitude is in excellent agreement\nwith that derived from the Moon (1985) calibrations and\nin some others it is even slightly fainter. Therefore the\ncriterion of over-luminosity is neither necessary nor sufficient to establish the multiple nature of a star. However\nit certainly prompts for further observations to ascertain\nits nature.\nWe add also that 16 \u03bb Boo stars are included in the\nGrenier et al. (1999) catalogue of a sample of 610 southern\nB8-F2 stars. Radial velocities are measured using a crosscorrelation method (the templates are a grid of synthetic\nspectra). For 2 of them (HD 183324 and HD 223352) no\nRV is given because the cross correlation with the adopted\ntemplate produced a correlation peak too low and asymmetric; 2 other (HD 111786 and HD 141851) are certain\ndoubles, 4 (HD 30422, HD 31295, HD 193281 and HD\n210111) are probable and other 4 (HD 319, HD 75654, HD\n79108 and HD 204041) suspected doubles, 1 (HD 142703)\nis a probable multiple system, 1 (HD 170680) showed the\nwide peak of B stars and only 1 (HD 39421) had symmetric and gaussian profile. We cannot consider these remarks\nas a definite proof of the duplicity of these stars, but an indication that a careful check for non-duplicity is required\nbefore to elaborate abundance analyses of them. The fact\nthat 14 over the 16 examined \u03bb Boo stars gave problems\nin the RV measures is a further indication of the high percentage of composite spectra objects among \u03bb Boo stars.\nWe finally note that for 19 stars the UV flux (TD1)\ncannot be reproduced by any LTE computation (groups\n3a and 3b of Gerbaldi et al., 2003). Five of these stars\nare already known to produce composite spectra, two are\nclassified D and one U by Hipparcos, while six have not\nbeen observed by this satellite. A distorted UV flux is not\nby itself evidence of duplicity, however alternative expla-\n\n\f12\n\nR. Faraggiana et al.: \u03bb Boo stars with composite spectra\n\nnations are more contrived. Therefore these stars ought to\nbe further scrutinized in order to understand the reasons\nfor this anomalous flux distribution.\n\n5. Conclusions: duplicity and \u03bb Boo nature\nFrom the above discussion we may conclude that the percentage of \u03bb Boo stars with composite spectra is at least\n17%, but could rise up to 28% if all the stars for which\na composite spectrum is suspected were confirmed, and\neven more if we consider that for several stars, mainly the\nfaintest ones, there is no data beyond classification dispersion spectra.\nIn order to understand the \u03bb Boo phenomenon the list\nof \u03bb Boo stars should be cleared of all the above stars for\nwhich the \u03bb Boo classifications has not been confirmed\nwhen taking into account the duplicity. For example for\nthe SB2 HD 84948 we have shown that the current \u03bb Boo\nclassification of the two components is based on an abundance analysis made by assuming incorrect atmospheric\nparameters (Faraggiana et al., 2001a). Therefore the \u03bb\nBoo status of this star has still to be demonstrated.\nThe claim of Faraggiana & Bonifacio (1999) that undetected duplicity often results in underabundances, when\nthe spectrum is subject to a standard abundance analysis has recently found an independent confirmation by the\nanalysis of overluminous F-type stars by Griffin & Suchkov\n(2003). These authors analyzed F stars for which the absolute magnitude derived from uvby\u03b2 photometry is over\n0.5 mag greater than that derived from the Hipparcos parallax. In their sample of 77 stars they found 27 new binary\nsystems from the radial velocity survey. The percentage of\nnewly detected SB2 systems with positive [Fe/H] is 6 %,\nwhile the same percentage on the whole sample is 21 %,\nclearly showing that a composite spectrum may simulate\nmetal underabundance more often than not.\nAt present the connection between the \u03bb Boo nature and duplicity, if any, is not clear. The evidence we\nhave presented here implies that a non-negligible fraction\nof \u03bb Boo stars has composite spectra due to duplicity.\nFurthermore the effect of duplicity, when neglected, is\nsuch as to mimic underabundances, which is one of the\nmain characteristics of \u03bb Boo stars. Therefore for all the\nstars with composite spectra the \u03bb Boo classification needs\nto be re-established (or rejected) taking into account the\ncomposite nature of the spectra. It would be tempting to\nconclude that the \u03bb Boo phenomenon is solely due to undetected duplicity. However, on the one hand, there exists\na majority of stars for which no sign of duplicity has been\ndetected, although one should keep in mind that in some\ncases duplicity has not been searched for, or v sin i is too\nlarge for a spectroscopic detection or the stars are too\nfaint and the angular separation too small to be resolved\nvisually. On the other hand, it may well be that the \u03bb\nBoo stars with composite spectra, when analyzed taking\ninto account their binary or multiple nature, still show the\nunderabundances typical of \u03bb Boo stars.\nIf a significant number of \u03bb Boo stars with composite\nspectra, when properly analysed, show \"normal\" (i.e. solar\n\nor solar\u2013scaled) chemical abundances the very existence of\n\u03bb Boo stars as a class of chemically peculiar stars may be\ncalled into question.\nWe believe that the most urgent thing to do, at\npresent, in the study of \u03bb Boo stars is to perform such\na detailed analysis for as many \u03bb Boo stars with composite spectra as possible. It is of paramount importance that\nsuch analysis is based on many spectra, taken at different\nphases, with as large a spectral coverage as possible.\nThe other way to tackle the problem is to pursue observations at high angular resolution, interferometric instrumentation on large telescopes, especially to VLTI should\nadd valuable information, allowing to explore effectively\nthe problem of the \u03bb Boo stars. If the \u03bb Boo phenomenon\nis due to undetected duplicity one may expect the detection of new previously unknown binary systems.\nWhat we now consider firmly established is:\n1. the analysis of the \u03bb Boo binaries abundances must be\ndone by disentangling the observed composite spectra;\n2. in order to know the position of the stars of a multiple\nsystem in the HR diagram one has to know the Teff and\nL of all the components. Adopting average values of\nboth parameters to speculate on the evolutionary stage\nof \u03bb Boo stars does not have any physical meaning.\nThis paper concludes our series on the \u03bb Boo candidates. We believe we have convincingly demonstrated the\nneed for high resolution spectroscopy over a large wavelength interval and spectrum synthesis in order to determine the chemical composition of the \u03bb Boo candidates\nwith composite spectra. Such an analysis has not been\nperformed for any of them, yet. The current generation\nof echelle spectrographs on 4m and 8m class telescopes is\nwell suited to tackle the problem.\nAcknowledgements.
