We show that this leads to the existence of stable one-dimensional bright\nmicrocavity solitons supported by the repulsive polariton nonlinearity. To achieve localization along\nthe second transverse direction we propose to create a special soliton waveguide by changing the\ncavity detuning and hence the boundary of the soliton existence in such a way that the solitons are\nallowed only within the stripe of the desired width.\n\nThe study of nonlinear and quantum effects in optical microcavities is an area of current vigorous activity\n[1, 2, 3]. In particular, the strong coupling regime in\nquantum well semiconductor microcavities [1, 2] leads\nto a strong and fast nonlinear response of microcavity exciton polaritons, which have been used for low\nthreshold bistability [4, 5, 6, 7], parametric wave mixing\n[8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13] and for the demonstration of long\nrange polariton coherence supporting claims for observation of Bose-Einstein condensation [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19].\nResearch in this area bordering condensed matter physics\nand photonics has links with many topics of current interest, which include, but not limited to, superfluidity,\nsolitons, vortices, photonic crystals and quantum information.\nDiffraction and dispersion are important features of\nwaves of any nature and the problem of their control\nstimulates significant research efforts. The recent time\nhas witnessed remarkable developments into photonic\ncrystals, which can be used to fully compensate diffraction and to control its value and sign, see, e.g., [20, 21].\nThe ideas developed for electromagnetic waves have also\nbeen applied to matter waves [22], surface plasmons [23]\nand other waves. Microcavity polaritons have been a\npart of these research efforts, with periodic potentials for\npolaritons created by the mirror patterning or by the surface acoustic waves [24, 25]. Note, that the term diffraction is most commonly used when the beam spreading\nhappens upon propagation in space. While, in the context of planar microcavities one deals with the temporal evolution of spots of light, which is analogous to the\nspreading of quantum wave packets. This evolution is\ngoverned by the dispersion law linking the frequency (or\nenergy) to the transverse wavenumber (or momentum).\nDiffraction and dispersion control has been comprehensively discussed and used in conjunction with spatial\nand temporal soliton formation, see e.g. [26, 27, 28]. A\nparticular field of these studies concerns spatial cavity\nsolitons in the weak coupling regime with periodic modulation of the detuning and/or other cavity parameters,\nsee, e.g., [29]. Weak and strong coupling regime differ\nmainly in that in the latter case the dispersion curve ex-\n\nhibits two branches signalling mixing of light and matter\nexcitations. Namely, additionally to the upper parabolic\nbranch, which is largely a photonic one, the lower polariton branch appears. In our context the most relevant feature is that this lower branch exhibits an inflection point\nwhere the second order dispersion changes sign [Fig.1(a)].\nIt is worth noting that this effect is merely evoked by the\nstrong photon-exciton coupling, hence it appears even in\na homogeneous cavity and does not require any modulation as in the weak coupling regime. The primary\ngoal of this Letter is to demonstrate how this peculiarity\ncan be exploited for the formation of stable bright cavity polariton solitons (CPSs) supported by the repulsive\nexciton-exciton interaction. However, the inflection of\nthe dispersion curve provides only localization in one dimension and additional measures for soliton trapping in\nthe other dimension have to be implemented relying on\nthe soliton existence domain shift by means of the space\ndependent detuning control.\nRecently it has been suggested to use bright cavity solitons in the weak coupling regime in all optical processing\nschemes [30, 31, 32]. In this context bright CPSs in the\nstrong coupling regime are superior and promising candidates for a practical implementation because they have\na picosecond excitation time and require extremely low\npump intensities of about 100 W/cm2 , thus surpassing\ntheir weakly coupled counterparts by almost two orders\nof magnitude on these two crucial parameters [33]. The\nfirst experimental observations of dark and bright solitonlike structures in the strong coupling regime of semiconductor microcavities have been recently reported in [34]\ncalling for more theoretical and experimental studies of\nthis topic. It has been demonstrated [33] that the dark\nsolitons are the only stable solutions with momenta centered around the bottom of the lower polariton branch.\nThe widely accepted dimensionless model for excitons\nstrongly coupled to cavity photons is [1, 2, 6, 33]\n\u2202t E \u2212 i(\u2202x2 + \u2202y2 )E + [\u03b3c \u2212 i\u2206 \u2212 iU (y)] E =\n= i\u03a8 + E0 eik0 x ,\n\n2\n\n\u2202t \u03a8 + (\u03b30 \u2212 i\u2206)\u03a8 + i|\u03a8| \u03a8 = iE.\n\n(1)\n\n\f2\nRe\u03a9 \u00b1\u2212\u03c9r /\u03a9R\n\n1.5\n\n0.6\n\n(a)\n\n1\nUP\n\n0.5\n0\n\n0.2\n0\n\nkd\n-2\n\ni\u03a9\u00b1 (k)~\npk =\n\nD4\nD3\n\nLP\n\n-0.5\n-1\n-4\n\nproblem:\n\n(b)\n\nD1\n\n0.4\n\n0\n\n2\n\nkd\n\n-0.2\n\nk\n\n4\n\n0\n\nD2\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\nk0\n\n4\n\nFIG. 1: (color online) (a) Polariton dispersion: lower (LP)\nand upper(UP) branch in the strong coupling regime. (b)\nDispersion coefficients vs. inclination of the holding beam k0 .\n\nHere E and \u03a8 are the averages of the photon and exciton creation or annihilation operators and polarization\neffects are disregarded. The normalization is such that\n(\u03a9R /g)|E|2 and (\u03a9R /g)|\u03a8|2 are the photon and exciton numbers per unit area. Here, \u03a9R is the Rabi frequency and g is the exciton-exciton interaction constant.\n\u2206 = (\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9r )/\u03a9R describes detuning of the pump frequency \u03c9 from the identical resonance frequencies of excitons and cavity, \u03c9r . The time t is measured in units of\n1/\u03a9R . \u03b3c and \u03b30 are the cavity and exciton damping constants normalized to \u03a9R . The transverse\ncoordinates x,\np\ny are normalized to the value x0 = c/2kz n\u03a9R \u223c 1\u03bcm\nwhere c is the vacuum light velocity, n is the refractive\nindex and kz = n\u03c9/c is the wavenumber. The normalized\namplitude of the external pump E0 is related to the physical incident intensity Iinc as |E0 |2 = g\u03b3c Iinc /~\u03c90 \u03a9R 2\n[13]. k0 is the transverse wavenumber of the pump, with\nk0 = 0 corresponding to normal incidence. As a guideline for realistic estimates one can use parameters of a\nmicrocavity with a single InGaAs/GaAs quantum well:\n~\u03a9R \u2243 2.5 meV, ~g \u2243 10\u22124 eV\u03bcm2 , see [5, 6]. Assuming the relaxation times of the photonic and excitonic fields to be 2.5 ps gives \u03b3c,0 \u2243 0.1. In accordance\nwith this set of parameters the normalized driving amplitude |E0 |2 = 1 corresponds to an external pump intensity of about 10 kW/cm2 . Optical bistability appears for\n|Ep | \u223c 0.1 or about 102 \u2212103 W/cm2 . U (y) is the spatially\nvarying shift of the cavity resonance which represents a\npotential for photons. The spatial inhomogeneities of the\ncavity and quantum wells are assumed negligible, so that\nlong range spatial effects can be observed. As, for example, in the recent demonstration of the 50\u03bcm in diameter\nanti-phase polariton \u03c0-state in a microcavity with periodically patterned mirrors [24].\nTo understand the physics of CPS formation and to\nidentify domains of their existence we first expand the\nlinear polariton dispersion around the pump wavevector,\nand arrive after an inverse Fourier transformation at a\nsingle equation with an effective nonlinearity and multiple dispersion terms. We assume U = 0 and look for the\nlinear polariton eigenstates, i.e., the photons trapped in\nthe pump free cavity (E0 = 0, \u2206 \u2192 \u2212\u03c9r /\u03a9R ) coupled\nto noninteracting excitons. Seeking solutions of Eqs. (1)\nin the form E, \u03a8 = ek , \u03c8k e\u2212i\u03a9t+ikx gives the eigenvalue\n\n\u0012\n\nik 2 + \u03b3c + i\u03c9r /\u03a9R\n\u2212i\n\u2212i\n\u03b30 + i\u03c9r /\u03a9R\n\n\u0013\n\n~pk ,\n\n(2)\nwhere p~k = {ek , \u03c8k } is the polariton basis vector and\n\u03a9\u00b1 (k) are the eigenfrequencies, corresponding to the\nupper- (+) and lower- (-) branch of the polariton dispersion curve, respectively, see Fig. 1. The inflection point\n\u2202k2 \u03a9\u2212 = 0 is located at k = kd , where second order dispersion disappears.\nThe standard next step here would be to disregard the\nupper branch and to consider the k0 values close to zero,\nsee, e.g. [1, 2, 5, 6]. In order to embrace the inflection point and to account for the varying dispersion we\nmodify this technique and include higher-order dispersion\nterms. To Rachieve this we perform the Fourier transform\n{E, \u03a8} \u2243 a(t, k)~\npk eikx dk, where a(t, k) is the Fourier\namplitude of the k-th component and p~k corresponds to\nthe lower polariton branch. We assume that the spectrum of the polariton wavepacket is centered around k0\nand expand \u03a9\u2212 (k) up to the fourth order in |k \u2212 k0 |. The\nslowly varying Ramplitude of the polariton wavepacket is\n\u221e\nthen A(t, x) = \u2212\u221e a(t, k)ei(k\u2212k0 )x d(k \u2212 k0 ) and obeys:\ni\u2202t A + iD1 \u2202x A + D2 \u2202x2 A \u2212 iD3 \u2202x3 A \u2212 D4 \u2202x4 A\u2212\n\u2212 \u03b4A \u2212 \u03be | A |2 A = i\u03b7E0 ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03b4 = \u03a9\u2212 (k0 ) \u2212 \u03c9/\u03a9R , Re \u03b4 is the polariton\ndetuning from the pump frequency and Im \u03b4 is the\nloss. D1 = \u2202k \u03a9\u2212 |k0 is the transverse group velocity\nand D2 = (1/2)\u2202k2 \u03a9\u2212 |k0 , D3 = (1/6)\u2202k3 \u03a9\u2212 |k0 , D4 =\n(1/24)\u2202k4\u03a9\u2212 |k0 are the dispersion coefficients [Fig. 1(b)].\n\u03be = |\u03c8k0 |4 /(|ek0 |2 + |\u03c8k0 |2 ) is the effective nonlinearity\nand \u03b7 = ek0 /(|ek0 |2 + |\u03c8k0 ) |2 ). For k0 varying from zero\nand towards, (but not too close to kd ) D2 > 0 dominates\nover Dm>2 [Fig. 1(b)]. In this case Eq. (3) coincides\nwith the well-known weak-coupling Lugiato-Lefever (LL)\nmodel [35].\nIn the LL models applied for the lower polaritons the\ndispersion is always normal, D2 > 0, and the nonlinearity\nis repulsive, therefore the only stable CPSs are the dark\nones [33], while bright solitons exist, but are unstable\n[Fig. 2(a,b)]. However, D2 (k) crosses zero at k0 = kd and\nthe D3 -term becomes the leading one around this point.\nThen the D3 -term drops and the polariton dispersion is\ndetermined by the competing D2 and D4 terms. Both\nD2 < 0 and D4 > 0 favor the existence of bright solitons\nfor the repulsive nonlinearity and therefore we expect\nto find them for k0 > kd . Moreover, it is evident that\nbecause of D1 6= 0 these solitons are forced to move.\nWhile the above considerations are useful for qualitative understanding, we return to the original model (1)\nwith \u2202y = 0 in order to compute 1D bright CPSs.

Bright CPS\nsolutions of the above model are found by a modification of the Newton method allowing to treat v as an\nunknown variable. The maximum of v occurs at k = kd ,\nthen the soliton velocity decreases with k0 increasing\nand approaches zero, see Fig. 3(a). This is in remarkable contrast to what happens if dispersion is parabolic,\nwhere the soliton velocity continuously increases with k0 .\nFor our choice of parameters v must be multiplied by\n4 \u00d7 106 m/s to give the physical velocity. It implies that\nthe CPS with v = 0.25 will traverse across the typical\ndistance of 100\u03bcm in 100ps. This is 40 times larger than\nthe polariton life time. Hence, once excited, the solitons\nhave enough time to shape and be observed during their\nmotion.\nPlots illustrating the dependence of the maximal soliton amplitude from the pump field and the associated\nbistability curves for the homogeneous (\u2202x,y = 0) solutions are shown in the left column of Fig. 2. The right\ncolumn shows the corresponding transverse soliton profiles. For k0 = 0 we are reproducing the results of [33]\nwith bright CPSs being unstable. For k0 just below and\nabove kd the branch of bright CPSs starts bending and\nislands of their stability start to emerge and expand with\nk0 increasing.\nTo reveal the influence of different dispersion orders on\nthe CPSs we plotted the dependence of the CPS width\n\nFIG. 4: (color online) (a) Soliton moving along the potential\nattractive for linear polaritons: U = b exp[\u2212(y/2)8 ], b = 2,\nE0 = 0.18. Other parameters as in Fig. 2(e,f). (b) Soliton\nmoving along the repulsive potential b = \u22121, E0 = 0.213.\n\non the inclination parameter k0 in Fig. 3(b). Since not\nonly the dispersion coefficients vary with k0 , but also\nRe \u03b4 (which strongly influences the CPS width), we have\nkept the latter fixed at Re \u03b4 = \u22120.3, by adjusting the\ndetuning \u2206 respectively. For large k0 the excitonic part\nof CPSs dominates over the photonic component, see Fig.\n2. That is why the CPSs can be much narrower than the\npure photonic cavity solitons in the weak coupling regime\nand may attain widths well below the ones allowed by the\nphotonic dispersion, although this happens at the price of\noscillatory tails. The CPS width is expected to\n\u221a scale with\nthe dominant dispersion coefficients as \u223c m Dm (m =\n2, 3, 4). Fig. 3(b) compares the numerically found soliton\nwidth (diamonds) with the scaling given by the different\ndispersion orders (dashed lines). Third-order dispersion\ndescribes well the soliton width for relatively small k0\nwhere D2 \u2243 0. Further inclination brings D2 on the\ntop, while the third-order dispersion vanishes. A further\nincrease of k0 brings fourth-order dispersion into play,\nwhich starts to compete with D2 .\nIn order to use CPSs as information bits, it is desirable to have them robustly localized in both transverse\ndimensions. However in the homogeneous cavity this is\nimpossible to achieve, since the signs of polariton dispersion are opposite in orthogonal directions. To solve this\nproblem we propose to shift the cavity detuning in such\na way that outside the waveguide area the soliton existence conditions are not satisfied. This is particularly\neasy to achieve if the operating frequency is not far from\nthe boundary of the existence domain. With this approach, it does not matter if one uses U (y), which traps\nlinear waves, or U (y), which repels them. Thus using\nof strongly nonlinear polariton waves extends the list of\n\n\f4\n\n|yk |2\n\n0.3\n\n(a)\n\n0.2\n\nk\n\nk\n\nS\n\n0\n0.5\n\nP\n\n0\n\nk\n\n0.1\n\nRe\u03a9 \u00b1\u2212\u03c9r /\u03a9R\n\nk\n\nI\n\n(b)\n\n0\n\nLP\n\n-0.5\n-1\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\nk\n\n3\n\nFIG. 5: (color online) (a) Excitonic part of the soliton spectrum (|\u03c8k |) of the the soliton shown in Fig. 2(d).

Fig. 4(a) demonstrates\nsoliton guiding in the trapping potential and Fig. 4(b)\nin the repelling potential. The trapping potential looks\npreferential for the soliton guidance, because it reduces\nsoliton interaction with the quasi-linear waves. The latter are far more pronounced in the case of the repelling\npotential, see Fig. 4(b). Practical excitation of CPSs is\nno different from their weakly coupled counterparts and\nrequires short term application of the addressing beam\nin addition to the pump E0 [31, 32].\n\n[1] B.

We have also demonstrated the continuous\ntransformation between cavity soliton polaritons shaped\nby the different dispersion orders, including the regimes\nwhere the influence of the usual second order dispersion\nis negligible. We have proposed a mechanism for their\nguiding and localization in the second transverse dimension. Our results form the basis for future studies of\nsoliton-polariton logic and processing schemes.\nNote. During the revision of this manuscript the related experimental observations of moving quasi-localised\npolaritons have been published [37]. Brief preliminary\ncomparison of dispersion plots from [37] with our results is very encouraging. To reveal the soliton frequency content we take theR Fourier transform of its ex\u221e\ncitonic component: \u03c8k = \u2212\u221e \u03a8\u0303(x \u2212 vt)eik0 x+ikx dx =\nR\u221e\nf (k \u2212 k0 )eivt(k0 \u2212k) , where f (k) = \u2212\u221e \u03a8\u0303(\u03be)eik\u03be d\u03be. |\u03c8k |\nis plotted in Fig. 5(a). Apart from the infinite peak\nat the at k0 corresponding to the background, the soliton spectrum proper shows 3-peak structure, such that\n2kp = ki + ks , where kp \u2248 k0 \u2248 kd . The idler field ki\nwas externally seeded and the signal ks was generated in\nRef. [37], while both of them are the integral parts of\nour soliton solution. Soliton frequency calculated from\n\u03c8k is a straight line shifted upwards from the dispersion\nof linear polaritons (Fig. 5(b)). Figs. 5(a,b) essentially\nmatch the corresponding data from [37].\n\n[23]\n[24]\n[25]\n[26]\n[27]\n[28]\n[29]\n\n[30]\n[31]\n[32]\n[33]\n[34]\n[35]\n[36]\n[37]\n\nT. Anker et al., Phys. Rev.
