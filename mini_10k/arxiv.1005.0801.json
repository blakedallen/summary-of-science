The detector performed extraordinarily well in Run I (1992-1996), as\ndemonstrated by the discovery of the top quark [2] and many other published\nphysics results [3].\nDuring Run I, the Tevatron operated using six bunches each of protons and\nanti-protons with 3500 ns between bunch crossings. In Run II,started in 2001,\nit is operated with 36 bunches of protons and anti-protons with a bunch spacing of 396 ns. The instantaneous luminosity exceeds 4\u00d71032 cm\u22122 s\u22121 , and more\nthan 12 fb\u22121 of data are expected to be delivered in Run II. The center-of-mass\nenergy is 1.96 TeV in Run II compared to 1.8 TeV in Run I.\nWith the expected increase in the Tevatron luminosity and the experience\ngained in operating the D0 detector and in analyzing data from Run I, the D0\ncollaboration upgraded the detector [4] to ensure the full exploitation of the\nphysics opportunities in Tevatron Run II.\n\nFig. 1. Cross sectional view of the Run II D0 detector.\n\nFigure 1 shows a cross sectional view of the Run II D0 detector. This upgrade includes faster electronics to match the reduced bunch crossing interval,\nupgrades of the muon system [5], and new central and forward preshower\ndetectors to improve e/\u03b3 identification. Most important is a completely new\ncentral tracking system, illustrated in Fig. 2. A 2 T axial magnetic field is\nprovided by a \u2248 2.6 m long superconducting solenoid magnet with \u2248 0.5 m\n1\n\n\fFig. 2. Cross sectional view of the Run IIa D0 tracking system.\n\ninner radius. The solenoid encloses a scintillating fiber tracker and a silicon\nmicrostrip tracker. The Central Fiber Tracker (CFT) consists of eight concentric barrels of scintillating fibers with axial and \u00b130 stereo read out. The\nSilicon Microstrip Tracker (SMT) is situated inside the CFT.\nSince Run II has a higher instantaneous luminosity than Run I, the trigger\nsystem was also upgraded. This new system is formed by three distinct levels.\nThe first stage, Level 1, comprises a collection of hardware trigger elements\nwhich reduces the input rate of 2 MHz to approximately 2 kHz. The Level 2\ntrigger system reduces the rate further by a factor of two. In this second\nstage, hardware engines and embedded microprocessors associated with specific subdetectors provide information to a global processor which constructs\na trigger decision based on individual objects as well as object correlations.\nThe SMT is one of the subdetectors taking part in the Level 2 trigger. This\nso called Silicon Track Trigger (STT) is further described in Ref. [6]. Events\nthat passed Level 1 and Level 2 are sent to the Level 3 trigger farm for real\ntime reconstruction, reducing the rate to 50 Hz.\nThe purpose of this paper is to provide a description of the D0 Silicon Microstrip Tracker built for Run II. In 2006 the dector was upgraded with an\nextra layer of silicon which was added close to the beam pipe. This is called\nlayer 0 and is described in Ref. [7]. Furthermore the most forward and backwards disks seen in Fig. 2 where removed. The period before this upgrade is\nreferred to as Run IIa and the period after as Run IIb. In the following section\n2\n\n\fa general overview of the detector is given. Section 3 provides an overview of\nthe mechanical aspects of the tracker, including a description of the cooling.\nThis is followed by a section on the readout system. In Sec. 5, silicon wafer\nproduction and testing are described. The two following sections are about the\nproduction and quality control of the various detector components. The detector assembly is described in Sec. 8, and in Sec. 9, the installation is described.\nThe paper concludes by summarizing some aspects of the performance of the\ndetector.\nIn the description of the detector a right-handed coordinate system is used.\nThe z-axis is along the proton beam direction and the y-axis is upward, as\nillustrated in Fig. 1. The angles \u03c6 and \u03b8 are the azimuthal and polar angles,\nrespectively. The r coordinate denotes the perpendicular distance from the z\naxis.\n\n3\n\n\f2\n\nGeneral Overview\n\nThe design goal of the SMT was to provide both tracking and vertexing over\nthe full pseudorapidity (\u03b7) 1 coverage of the calorimeter and muon systems.\nSeveral of the Tevatron machine parameters had a large effect on the SMT\ndesign. The luminosity sets a scale for the radiation damage expected over\nthe life of the detector, which in turn dictates the operating temperature. The\nbunch spacing sets the design parameters for the electronics and readout, as\nwell as the probability that multiple interactions occur in a single crossing.\nThe length of the interaction region sets the length scale of the device. With\na long interaction region of about 25 cm rms, it is difficult to deploy detectors\nsuch that the tracks are generally perpendicular to detector surfaces for all \u03b7.\nThis feature led to the hybrid system shown in Fig. 3, with barrel detectors\nmeasuring primarily the r-\u03c6 coordinate and disk detectors which measure r-z\nas well as r-\u03c6. Thus verticies for high |\u03b7| particles are reconstructed in three\ndimensions by the disks, and verticies of particles at small values of |\u03b7| are\nmeasured in the barrels. This design poses difficult mechanical challenges in\nthe arrangement of the detector types to provide space for cooling and cables\nwhile minimizing dead areas.\n\nFig. 3. Isometric view of the Run IIa D0 silicon tracker.\n\nThe design of the SMT was also influenced by the requirements of minimal\nmass, a precise alignment between sensors and support structures, and adequate thermal performance of the silicon modules in both the barrels and the\ndisks. The barrel/disk design made it necessary to have the front-end electronics attached to the sensor structures. All these design constraints of the barrel\nsilicon modules, called the ladders, led to a layout of the basic detector unit\nwith approximately rectangular beryllium substrates with one (single-sided\nh\n\ni\n\nThe pseudorapidity is defined as \u03b7 = \u2212 ln tan( 12 \u03b8) where \u03b8 is the polar angle\nrelative to the proton beam axis.\n1\n\n4\n\n\fsensors) or two (double-sided sensors) silicon surfaces glued to them. The\nberyllium substrates conduct heat from sensors and their on-board readout to\ncooling and support bulkheads. They also include features which provide precise alignment of ladder sensors to the bulkhead. A printed flex circuit, called\nthe High Density Interconnect (HDI), carrying the readout chips and passive\nelectronics components, was laminated onto the beryllium. A long flexible tail,\ncalled the pigtail, of the HDI allowed easy routing of the data and supply lines\nthrough the barrel structures. The readout chip, called the SVXIIe chip [8]\nprovides 128 channels, each including a preamplifier, a 32 cell deep analog\npipeline, and an 8 bit ADC.\nEach of the six barrels is 12 cm long and has 72 ladders arranged in four layers,\nwith each layer having two sub-layers at slightly different radii to provide\nazimuthal overlap, as illustrated in Fig. 4. The two outer barrels have 36\nsingle-sided (SS) and 36 double-sided 2\u25e6 stereo (DS) ladders. The four inner\nbarrels have 36 double-sided double-metal (DSDM) 90\u25e6 stereo and 36 doublesided 2\u25e6 stereo ladders. Figure 5 shows the locations of the different sensors\nin the six barrels. In the text the ladders are often referred to as 3-chip (SS),\n6-chip (DSDM), and 9-chip (DS) ladders according to the number of SVXIIe\nchips mounted on them. The ladders are mounted between two precisionmachined beryllium bulkheads. The bulkhead that supports the sides of the\nladders carrying the readout electronics is equipped with cooling channels.\nEach barrel is capped with a disk of wedge detectors, called the F-disks. The\nF-disks comprise twelve wedges made of double-sided silicon wafers with trapezoidals shapes. The stereo angle of the F-wedges is 30\u25e6 . The n-side is connected\nto 6 readout chips and the p-side to 8 chips. To provide further coverage at\nintermediate |\u03b7|, the central system is completed with a set of three F-disks\non each end of the barrel assembly. Each disk is rotated by 7.5\u25e6 with respect\nto its neighboring disk.\nIn both the far-forward and far-backward region, two large diameter disks,\ncalled the H-disks, provide tracking information. The H-disks are made of 24\npairs of single-sided detectors glued back to back, giving a stereo angle of 15\u25e6 .\nEach detector is read out by 6 chips. Since these disks give the last trackmeasuring points before the end calorimeters, the mass constraints on these\ndetectors are more relaxed than for the F-disks or barrel ladders. This allowed\nthe use of back-to-back single-sided detectors in a less compact package than\nthe F-disks. The H-disks were designed to improve momentum resolution for\ntracks up to |\u03b7| = 3.\nFor both the F-disks and the H-disks, the wedges are mounted and aligned on\nberyllium rings which include cooling channels. The barrels together with the\nF-disks are precisely mounted on two carbon fiber cylinders which meet at the\nnominal interaction point in the D0 detector. The four H-disks are individually\n5\n\n\fFig. 4.

To allow optimal reconstruction of trajectories, the positions of\ndetector elements must be known well enough that uncertainties in their positions contribute negligibly to track reconstruction inaccuracies. This placed\nrequirements upon the position stability and upon the accuracy with which\npositions need to be known.\nEach barrel is 120 mm long and 201 mm in diameter. The ladders are parallel\nto the beam pipe. The wedges are held in disks in which the planes of the\nwedges are normal to the beam line. The two types of disks, F-disks and H7\n\n\fdisks, have active regions with outer diameter of 206.4 mm and of 470.1 mm,\nrespectively, measured along the center-lines of the sensors. Six of the F-disks\nare interleaved with and attached to barrels to form disk/barrel modules. The\nremaining disks are located at the ends of the barrel region, three F-disk and\ntwo H-disks at either end. The fiducial length of the central disk-barrel region\nis approximately 766 mm, the fiducial length including the F-disks is approximately 1066 mm and that including the H-disks is approximately 2432 mm.\nThe central silicon detector, including cabling and mechanical structures, fits\ninto a 360 mm diameter region. Including readout structures and protective\nenclosures but excluding mount structures, the total diameter of the H-disks\nis approximately 488 mm.\nTo limit the effects of multiple scattering and the production of secondary\nparticles and showers, it is important that the amount of material, in the\nmechanical structure measured in radiation lengths, is minimized. This implies\nthe use of large radiation length materials and the minimization of the mass\nof the support structure in a way consistent with other design requirements.\nBoth the disk-barrel modules and the end F-disks are supported from two\ncarbon-fiber-laminate cylinders of combined length approximately 1660 mm.\nThe two cylinders are butted against one another but electrically insulated\nfrom each another at z = 0. In turn, they are supported from the inner\nsurface of the innermost CFT barrel. Removable portions of the cylinders\nallowed modules to be installed. The cylinders also provide support for cables,\ncable connections, and coolant distribution manifolds. Each H-disk structure\nis independently supported from the inner surface of the innermost CFT barrel\nat large z via leaf-spring, ball-and-cone kinematic mounts.\nIn the SMT region, the beam pipe consists of a beryllium cylinder with an\nouter diameter of 38.1 mm and an overall length of 2378 mm.\nTo control noise and leakage currents in the high radiation environment, sensors are indirectly cooled by forced flow of an ethylene glycol-water mixture.\nThe coolant temperature is typically \u22128\u25e6 C.\n\n3.2 Ladders and Barrels\nBarrel silicon sensors are mounted on ladders which serve four purposes:\n(1) They fix the relative positions of pairs of silicon sensors and provide\nfeatures which allow the sensors to be accurately positioned in the barrel.\n(2) They aid in flattening the sensors and in maintaining flatness.\n(3) They hold the HDIs.\n(4) They provide a path by which the silicon and HDI components can be\n8\n\n\fcooled.\nAs mentioned in Sec. 2, three different types of ladders are used: 3-chip ladders,\n6-chip ladders which have the same width as the 3-chip ladders, and 9-chip\nladders which are wider. While the sensors for the 6-chip ladders are 120 mm\nlong, the 3-chip and 9-chip ladders are made of two 60 mm long rectangular\nsilicon sensors mounted end-to-end. A silicon barrel comprises four ladder\nlayers at different radii; each layer consists of an inner and an outer sub-layer.\nA summary of ladder dimensions is given in Table 2.\nTable 2\nLadder dimensions (mm)\nLadder type\n\n3-chip\n\n6-chip\n\n9-chip\n\nS\n\nD\n\nD\n\nStereo Angle (degrees)\n\nnone\n\n90\n\n2\n\nSilicon thickness\n\n0.300\n\n0.300\n\n0.300\n\n60.0\n\n120.0\n\n60.0\n\n120.125\n\n120.125\n\n120.125\n\n116.7\n\n116.7\n\n116.7\n\nSilicon width\n\n21.2\n\n21.2\n\n34.0\n\nActive width\n\n19.2\n\n19.2\n\n32.0\n\nMaximum HDI width\n\n25.2\n\n25.2\n\n38.0\n\nSingle/double sided\n\nLength of each sensor\nOverall length\nLength of active portions\n\nThe mechanical structure of a 3-chip ladder is shown in Fig. 6. Two rails, each\nmade of a fiber composite-Rohacell foam sandwich, interconnect and support\nthe silicon sensors. A layer of carbon-boron hybrid fibers plus a layer of carbon\nfibers was used for each fiber composite to closely match the thermal expansion\nof the silicon sensors. At the HDI end, the rails were bonded to the 0.40 mm\nthick beryllium substrate which provides reinforcement in the HDI region and\naids in conducting heat from the HDI components. This beryllium piece, along\nwith another piece near the opposite end of the ladder, also provides features\nused in positioning and holding the ladder.\nThe ladders were positioned between two bulkheads, a cooled, active, bulkhead\nand an uncooled, passive, bulkhead. Radial positions of the silicon are shown\nin Table 3 and Fig. 7. The ladders are grouped into 24 equal \u03c6 towers centered\non the layer 3 ladders as shown in Fig. 4. Layers 1 and 2, the two innermost\nlayers, have half as many ladders as layer 3. The \u03c6 positions of ladders in layers\n1 and 2 have been chosen to cover two towers. Each tower includes portions\nof 4 ladders.\n9\n\n\fFig. 6. Mechanical structure of the 3-Chip ladder with dimensions given in mm.\nThe bottom picture is a blow-up of the HDI area shown in the middle picture. The\nbulkheads are part of the support structure and not part of the ladder.\n\nSeveral considerations drove the choice of ladder location on the bulkheads.\n(1) Adequate overlap between adjacent ladders was provided to ensure complete \u03c6 coverage within each layer. This places restrictions on the maximum average radius of a layer, given the active widths and numbers of\nladders.\n(2) Sufficient space was provided between layers to permit ladder installation. The overall radial space for installing ladders is indicated in Tables 4 and 5. The minimum bulkhead layer-to-layer radial clearance is\n10.25 mm, allowing 1.73 mm clearance on both surfaces of an installed\nladder, assuming a ladder already in place on the opposite sub-layer surface.\n(3) The space needed for a 3.175 mm \u00d7 7.366 mm cooling channel placed a\nlower bound on the sub-layer radial spacing.\n(4) A minimum space of 5.516 mm was left between inner and outer sub-layer\nladder mounting surfaces for cables. Components which extend from the\nladder surfaces reduce the clear space for cables to about 2.7 mm.\n10\n\n\fTable 3\nLadder silicon radial positions along each ladders centerline.\nLayer\n\nSub-layer\n\nLadders/\n\nR (mm)\n\nsub-layer\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nInner\n\n6\n\n27.15\n\nOuter\n\n6\n\n36.45\n\nInner\n\n6\n\n45.50\n\nOuter\n\n6\n\n55.54\n\nInner\n\n12\n\n67.68\n\nOuter\n\n12\n\n75.82\n\nInner\n\n12\n\n91.01\n\nOuter\n\n12\n\n100.51\n\nTable 4\nTotal radial height of a ladder from the bottom up.\nElement\n\nRadial\nheight (mm)\n\nRail\n\n2.757\n\nAdhesive\n\n0.075\n\nSilicon sensor\n\n0.300\n\nAdhesive\n\n0.075\n\nBeryllium\n\n0.406\n\nAdhesive\n\n0.075\n\nHDI under chips\n\n0.117\n\nAdhesive\n\n0.075\n\nSVXIIe chip\n\n0.381\n\nWire-bonds (above chip)\n\n0.500\n\nTotal\n\n4.761\n\n(5) Space between adjacent ladders of a sub-layer was left for a 9.4 mm wide\nlayer-to-layer coolant connection. This limits the minimum radius of a\nlayer, given ladder physical widths and the number of ladders in the\n11\n\n\fFig. 7. Ladder positions on the active bulkhead. Four manifolds, two supply and\ntwo return, are indicated in the figure with S and R.\n\nlayer.\nFinal machining of the active and passive bulkheads of a barrel was done\nwith the bulkheads clamped together as a unit. This ensured that bulkhead\nladder mounting surfaces and mounting features match on each pair of bulkheads and helped ensure that installed ladders would be parallel to the beam\nline. Mounting surfaces were machined to a flatness of approximately 25 \u03bcm,\nand the mounting surfaces on the 9.525 mm thick active bulkhead were made\nperpendicular to the plane of the bulkhead to 25 \u03bcm. This establishes a maximum ladder slope at the active bulkhead of 25/9525 = 2.6 mrad. Assuming\nthis slope, perfect alignment of the active and passive bulkheads, and the appropriate elastic properties of a ladder, implies about 53 \u03bcm maximum radial\ndeflection of the ladder from a straight line.\n12\n\n\fTable 5\nRadial heights above the bulkhead mounting surface for an installed ladder.\nElement\n\nRadial\nheight (mm)\n\nAdhesive\n\n0.051\n\nBeryllium\n\n0.406\n\nAdhesive\n\n0.075\n\nSilicon sensor\n\n0.300\n\nAdhesive\n\n0.075\n\nBeryllium\n\n0.406\n\nAdhesive\n\n0.075\n\nHDI under chips\n\n0.117\n\nAdhesive\n\n0.075\n\nSVXIIe chip\n\n0.381\n\nWire-bonds above chips\n\n0.500\n\nTotal\n\n2.461\n\nLadders were positioned laterally with the aid of posts on the active and\npassive bulkheads which extend from the bulkhead mounting surfaces and engage notches in the ladder beryllium. Only the beryllium piece closest to the\nbulkhead mounting surface and the edges of the posts closest to the ladder\ncenterline were used for this purpose. Clearances between notches in the beryllium piece of the ladder and the posts were chosen so that ladders could be\nplaced on each bulkhead with a transverse accuracy of \u00b16 \u03bcm. Malleable pins\nthrough holes in the posts hold the ladder in place. In addition, the outermost\nlayer ladders were glued in place to provide a rigid coupling between the active\nand passive bulkheads. The ladders play a very important structural role in\nthe barrels. Each barrel is a complete, internally aligned unit. All barrel positioning was done with respect to the active bulkhead. The passive bulkhead\nis held and accurately positioned by the ladders and sets only the relative\npositions of ladders.\nThe barrel structure formed by the ladders and bulkheads must be sufficiently\nstiff that internal alignment criteria are satisfied under forces from the cables,\nthe coolant connections, and thermal contraction. The required stiffness is\nprovided without the use of additional structural members, by fastening ladders to the bulkheads with epoxy. The total barrel structure has a torsional\n13\n\n\fFig. 8. Barrel cable paths.\n\ncompliance of 0.11 \u03bcm/N*m assuming that the passive bulkhead positions ladders relative to each other only in r and \u03c6. Uncontrolled forces on the barrels\nare approximately 1 N. This leads to a negligible shift in ladder \u03c6 positions.\nShear stresses in the most highly stressed epoxy joints with a 1 N force applied to the passive bulkhead at a radius of 100 mm are 0.0050 MPa, a factor\nof more than 1300 below the shear strength of the electrically and thermally\nconductive adhesive used (e.g., TraCon 2902 silver-filled epoxy).\nThe pigtails that emerge at the HDI edge follow paths between and around\nladders to the outer radius of the barrel, penetrate the support half-cylinder\nor its covers, and connect to low mass cables mounted on the outside. An\nextra bulkhead ring, made of carbon fiber composite, is provided at a radius\nof about 130 mm to anchor the cables. The cables are grouped at this ring into\nbundles which are brought through the half-cylinder and its covers at 2:00,\n4:00, 6:00, 8:00, 10:00, and 12:00 o'clock as shown in Fig. 8.\n14\n\n\fFig. 9. F-disk detectors.\n\n3.3 F-Disk and F-Wedge Structure\nAs mentioned in Sec. 2, each barrel is accompanied by an F-disk, and three\nmore F-disks each are installed in the forward and backward regions. The\nschematic for an F-disk is shown in Fig. 9. It contains 12 double-sided wedges\nwhich are installed with alternating p- and n-sides. The dodecagon support\nstructure is made of beryllium and has a cross-section of 15.7 mm \u00d7 2.5 mm.\nA 7.5 mm \u00d7 1.0 mm channel in the beryllium provides a path for coolant flow\nto cool the wedges. Disks are oriented so that the wedges match the barrel\ntowers.\nThe disk thickness contributes to the z-gap between adjacent barrels. To minimize this thickness, the HDI was placed at the outer periphery of the wedge.\nThe thickness of the structure is 4.850 mm at the detector sensor and 6.322 mm\nat the SVXIIe chips, including 1 mm for two sets of wire-bonds. With additional clearance to avoid potential interference and accommodate thickness\n15\n\n\fvariations, the interleaved disks fit within a barrel-to-barrel gap of about 8 mm.\nA disk was attached to the active bulkhead of each barrel to form a disk/barrel\nmodule. This permitted the disk and barrel to be accurately matched and to\nbe installed as a unit. Each of the interleaved disks was attached to a barrel\nat three points spaced evenly in \u03c6. The posts are permanently attached to the\nberyllium disk support structure.\n3.4 Module Support\nThe disk/barrel modules and end disks were mounted from the support halfcylinders in a way which adequately resists the known gravitational forces\nand the somewhat variable forces from cabling and coolant connections. Provided that temperature variations are sufficiently independent of \u03c6, thermal\ncontraction effects are predictable. The thermal expansion coefficient of beryllium, 11.6 ppm/\u25e6 C, leads to a radial contraction of 21 \u03bcm for a 100 mm radius\nstructure which is cooled from 23\u25e6 C to 5\u25e6 C. Since the connections from disks\nand disk/barrel modules to the support half-cylinder are all nearly identical,\nthe vertical center-lines of these structures move together and good relative\nalignment is maintained.\nThe support half-cylinder is described in Sec. 3.7. Carbon fiber composite\nmounts attached to the active bulkheads connect disk/barrel modules to the\nhalf-cylinder at 3:00, 6:00, and 9:00 o'clock as shown in Fig. 7. The 3:00 and\n9:00 o'clock mounts control y and z positions, while the 6:00 o'clock mount\ncontrols x and z positions. Pairs of leaf springs allow motion in one direction\nwhile remaining stiff in the other two directions. A sapphire ball between the\nhalf-cylinder portion of the coupling and the barrel portion of the coupling\npermitted angular orientations to be matched during assembly; four screws\naround the ball allowed for adjustment and locking of the angular orientation.\n3.5 H-Disk and H-Wedge Structure\nAn H-disk is shown in Fig. 10. It contains 24 wedges which alternate on each\nsurface of a beryllium cooling pipe. Four disks were deployed for Run IIa, at\nz \u2248 \u00b1100 and \u00b1 121 cm. In Run IIb the two outermost disks were removed.\nWithin a disk, the alternating wedges are separated by 9.1 mm in z and the\nsensors are separated by \u2248 1.2 mm within a wedge. The disks are supported\nby a ball-and-cone mount from the CFT carbon fiber support cylinder. The\ndisk supports were installed and aligned on the CFT support cylinder using\na coordinate measuring machine during the assembly of the CFT to insure\nprecise alignment during installation of the disk assemblies in D0.\n16\n\n\fFig. 10. H-disk assembly.\n\nAn H-wedge was fabricated from two back-to-back, single-sided, detector assemblies (Fig. 11). The inner and outer radii at the wedge centerline are\n9.61 cm and 23.6 cm, respectively. The detector pair is supported by a beryllium plate, which also forms the wedge support for attachment to the beryllium cooling ring. Front and back detectors on a wedge were aligned using a\nspecially fabricated dual microscope alignment system.\n\n3.6 Cooling\nThe heat to be removed from detector-mounted readout electronics is summarized in Table 6. The combined power dissipation for the SVXIIe chips and\nother HDI components is about 3 mW per channel. Heat loss in the cabling\nbrings the total power dissipation to about 2400 W.\nThe ethylene glycol/water cooling was chosen because of the favorable heat\ncapacity of water and the simplicity of water systems. The cooling system\nconsists of a reservoir, pump, flow control valve, de-ionizer, vacuum system,\nsupply lines, return lines, and instrumentation. The pump circulates approximately 60 l/min of coolant. At this flow rate, the barrels, disks, and manifolds\nproduce an aggregate pressure drop of 55 kPa. To prevent coolant from leaking\n17\n\n\fFig. 11.

This pressure is\nachieved with an open bath on the suction side of the system from which fluid\n18\n\n\fis drawn through the detector; the pressure drop in the piping to the detector\nand elevation difference between the open bath and the detector determine\nthe pressure at the inlet to the detector. The pump is located at the floor of\nthe collision hall to take advantage of the available heat to ensure adequate\npressure on the suction side of the pump to avoid cavitation in the pump.\nWith 30% ethylene glycol/water mixture the system is operating at \u22128\u25e6 C. The\ntemperature within sensors varies with location from approximately \u22125\u25e6 C to\n+2\u25e6 C. The cooling system was designed to allow temperature to be lowered\nanother 7\u25e6 C if compensation for the effects of radiation damage proves to be\nnecessary.\nFour coolant manifolds, two supply and two return, provide coolant flow to the\nbarrels and disks. Each barrel requires two supply and two return connections,\nas shown in Fig. 7. The cooling channel of each layer of a barrel bulkhead is\ndivided into equal left and right portions. The left portions of all layers are\nconnected in series between the left supply and return manifolds. Similarly,\nthe right portions are connected in series between the right supply and return\nmanifolds. Layer-to-layer connections were machined as part of the bulkhead\nberyllium structure.\nDisk coolant flow is divided between equal length upper and lower paths. The\ntwo paths share coolant connections at 3:00 and 9:00 o'clock. To equalize flow\nrates in the supply and return manifolds, the flow direction is reversed from\none disk to the next. A set of supply and return manifolds is located on the\nouter surface of the half-cylinder near 3:30 o'clock; a second set is located near\n8:30 o'clock. The supply manifolds enter the half-cylinder region as 15.875 mm\ninside diameter (ID) lines. Approximately 700 mm along the half-cylinder,\nafter supplying the end disks and the first barrel/disk module, both lines\nreduce to 12.7 mm. The return manifolds have the same configuration, starting\nas 12.7 mm ID pipe and then increasing to 15.875 mm ID pipe between the\nsecond and third barrel/disk modules. This configuration of reducing supply\nmanifold size and increasing return manifold size produces evenly divided flow\nto the detectors. The manifolds are fabricated from thin-walled PVC pipe.\nCoolant connections from the disks and disk/barrel modules to the manifolds\nwere made with flexible tubing.\n\n3.7 Half-Cylinder and Cover\n\nCarbon fiber half-cylinders (Fig. 12) provide accurate and stable support of\ndetector elements. The half-cylinders are 1.1 m long, have an inside radius of\n145 mm, and outside radius of 153 mm. The half-cylinders consist of 0.9 mm\nthick inner and outer shells joined by 0.4 mm thick webs. The webs are spaced\n19\n\n\fFig. 12. Support half-cylinder and cover. IP denotes the nominal central interaction\npoint. The holes seen on the barrel are where the cables and cooling lines pass\nthrough it. The structure on the left disk is support for the cables.\n\nevery 25.65 mm in z. The outer ends of the half-cylinders are closed by 2 mm\nthick full circular membranes which have appropriate openings for the beam\npipe, cables, and coolant manifolds. The inner ends, near z=0, have 0.5 mm\ndisks with large wedge-shaped cutouts to reduce mass in this critical region. A\nthird circular membrane is present just beyond the outermost F-disk assembly.\nThe support half-cylinders were made from high modulus (900 MPa) carbon\nfiber prepreg plies. The high modulus carbon fiber has a low thermal expansion coefficient, high stiffness to mass ratio, reasonable cost, and acceptable\nfabrication properties. A low coefficient of thermal expansion ensures that\ntemperature gradients do not cause significant displacement of detector elements in the face of the large thermal gradients from the coexistence of cooled\nsurfaces and hot electronic chip modules. The high modulus minimizes deflections caused by gravitational, cabling, and coolant connection forces. Multiple\nhigh modulus carbon fiber plies are combined at specific angles to achieve a\nthermal expansion coefficient of approximately 0.9 ppm/\u25e6 C. The elastic mod20\n\n\fulus of the laminate is approximately 124 GPa (18 \u00d7 106 psi). This provides a\nstiffness to radiation length ratio which is five times that of steel and three\ntimes that of aluminum. The high modulus carbon fiber is an excellent electrical conductor for the frequencies of concern for electronic noise (up to 1 MHz).\nThe outer surface of the half-cylinder is wrapped with 2\" wide aluminum foil\ntape near the outer end to provide a connection from the carbon fiber to the\nelectronics ground.\nFinite element analysis, confirmed by analytical calculations, give a maximum\nhalf-cylinder deflection of 100 \u03bcm and rotations about the x-axis of 70 \u03bcrad at\nthe locations of the first and last barrels. Only a fraction of this maximum\ndeflection occurs over the length of the silicon tracker itself. Final alignment\nof each barrel/disk and end-disk assembly were done after the half-cylinders\nwere fully loaded (including cables) with the cylinders supported off their final\nmounting points so errors due to cylinder deflection were effectively removed.\nThe shells and webs were made as separate components from several layers\nof unidirectional carbon fiber prepreg tape. Each component was formed and\ncured at an elevated temperature. The components were assembled to form\nthe half-cylinder structures using room temperature curing epoxy.\nThe half-cylinders are supported from the CFT near z=0 and at z=830 mm.\nAt the inner end the cylinders have two feet located at \u00b145\u25e6 from the bottom\nwith spherical ceramic ends resting in reinforced mounting points attached to\nthe inner wall of the CFT.\nCovers for the half-cylinder provide a thermal barrier, mechanical and light\nprotection, electrostatic shielding, and a mounting surface for the low mass\ndata cables. The covers have the same mechanical configuration as the halfcylinders of an inner and an outer skin coupled with thin radial webs. Holes\nare provided to allow alignment of the completed assembly.\n3.8 Run IIa Beam Pipe\nThe part of the Tevatron Run IIa beam pipe that passes through the SMT has\na 38.1 mm outside diameter and a 0.508 mm thick wall. Bellows and knife-edge\nflanges are provided at each end of the 2.578 m long beam pipe assembly. The\nRun IIb beam pipe is described in [7].\nThe beryllium beam pipe was fabricated by rolling a beryllium sheet into a\nround cylindrical shape and joining the edges with a vertical strip, providing\nfour fillet locations for brazing. All beryllium to beryllium, and beryllium to\nstainless steel joints are brazed with an aluminum filler material.\n\n21\n\n\fFig. 13. D0 SMT readout system.\n\n4\n\nElectronics\n\n4.1 Introduction\n\nThe data acquisition and readout system for the SMT is responsible for gathering the charge from the silicon sensors, digitizing these data, and sending it\nto the D0 data acquisition system. The MIL-STD-1553 connection [9] to the\nD0 Control System provides the ability to download and monitor the readout\nelectronics. The readout system is depicted in the block diagram shown in\nFig. 13. The locations of the components are also indicated in the figure.\n22\n\n\fThe electronics design for the SMT was dictated by the physics needs of\nthe experiment, the engineering resources that were available, and the chip\ntechnology. The SVXIIe chip has 128 channels and a 32 deep pipeline delay to\nallow time for trigger formation; it can operate with 132 ns bunch spacing. The\nchips are mounted on the HDI, a polyimide hybrid. One HDI supports between\nthree and nine chips depending on the sensor arrangement. The pigtail on the\nHDI allows the chip signals to be routed to the outer edge of the detector\nbefore installing a connector.\nFrom the connector at the outer edge, a special polyimide cable, called the low\nmass cable, carries the signals for a distance of about 3 m to a small passive\ncircuit board referred to as the adapter card. The adapter card interfaces the\nlow mass cable to an 80-conductor 3M pleated foil cable. Two low mass cables\nare connected to each 80-conductor cable. Signal dispersion in this two-cable\ncombination limits the combined length to about 15 m. The 15 m point is at\nthe base of the liquid argon calorimeters. Since there is not enough space in\nthis area to house the readout, a repeater board, called the interface board, was\ninstalled to retransmit the signals to the electronics area under the detector.\nThe power supplies for the SMT are also located on the side of the central\ncalorimeter cryostat near the interface board.\nThe repeated signals are sent to a sequencer module (SEQ) located under the\ndetector on the D0 platform. The sequencer generates the sequences to download parameters into the SVXIIe chips, to put the chips into data acquisition\nmode, and to have the chips digitize and read out data in response to a trigger. During readout, the sequencer sends serialized data over a fiber optic link\nto a VME module, called a VME Read Out Buffer (VRB) [10]. The optical\ndata are converted to 20-bit parallel data words by the VRB Transition Module (VTM) before reaching the VRB. The VRB buffers the data from each\nLevel 1 triggers and waits for a Level 2 trigger accept. If one occurs, data\nare sent over the back plane to a VME readout controller and then sent over\nethernet to the Level 3 processor farm.\nThe following sections provide more detailed descriptions of the various components and the reasons for the design choices.\n\n4.2 Low Noise Design\n\nDesigning a precision, small-signal-level detector involves a complex interplay\nof mechanical and electrical design constraints. Many of the mechanical components are electrical conductors so they also have an affect on the electrical\nperformance of the detector. The main goals were to minimize induced noise in\nthe calorimeter, properly ground the beryllium mounting plates, and eliminate\n23\n\n\fground loops and other unwanted current paths through the detector.\nThe SMT is situated in the center of the calorimeter and many components\nare mounted on the calorimeter cryostat so preventing noise pick up required\ncareful design. It was decided not to take additional triggers while the SMT\nwas digitizing and reading out data, which means that when a Level 1 trigger\noccurs, all further Level 1 triggers are inhibited until all the data is read out\nfrom the current trigger. This results in Level 1 dead time for each Level 1 accept. The design of the SMT was simplified by this decision since the calorimeter signals are already stored in the calorimeter readout electronics when the\nSVXIIe digitization starts. In fact, many of the design choices such as singleended output from the SVXIIe and unshielded low mass cables would not have\nworked with simultaneous acquisition and digitization. Tests have shown that\nSMT digitization and readout generates noise signals in the calorimeter.\nThe only SMT signal that is active during calorimeter data taking is the clock,\nwhich is carefully shielded. The signal is sent differentially on a small, high\nquality coaxial cable using RF connectors. The pair of coaxial lines that are in\nthe calorimeter bore are housed in a single braided shield, and both lines are\nterminated on the HDI. There is no observable noise from the clock system.\nThe second area of concern was the grounding of the beryllium plates. There\nare two important grounds for these plates. The first is the connection to\nthe HDI. If this ground connection is not properly made, the beryllium will\nact as a floating capacitor, and any voltage induced on the plate will spread\nover the entire plate and then capacitively couple into the readout channels.\nThis ground is achieved by bonding the ground plane on the back of the HDI\ndirectly to the beryllium with conductive epoxy. The other concern was the\ndouble sided detectors. These modules have beryllium plates on each side of\nthe sensor, so they form a parallel plate capacitor with the sensor in the center.\nAny ground loop through this capacitor will induce noise into the sensor. The\noriginal solution was to use silver epoxy to form a conducting bridge between\nthe two pieces of beryllium. There is no direct contact in this case, so the\nconnection is dependent on the silver epoxy. Some of these bonds became\nresistive so all of the modules were repaired by wiring the pieces together.\nThe wire attachments to the beryllium were made with indium solder.\nThe final issue was ground loops through the SMT. The SMT is read out from\nboth ends, and each end is locally grounded. A potential difference might occur\nbetween the two ends and current will then flow in any path connecting one\nend of the detector to the other. If this current flows through the signal path,\nthe detector will see this current as noise. Therefore an electrical break was\nmade at z = 0 for both the detector structure and the cooling path. The\ncooling pipes were also electrically isolated by plastic tubes at both entrances\nto the SMT detector.\n24\n\n\fThe common ground point for each half of the SMT was achieved by an\naluminum ring which was constructed on the face of the calorimeter with all\nthe adapter cards mounted on it. The ring was electrically isolated from the\ncalorimeter and the adapter cards were all grounded to the ring. The ground\nconnection to the SMT is made through the parallel combination of all the\nlow mass cables.\n\n4.3 SVXIIe Chip\nThe SVXIIe chip [8] is a 128 channel, full custom, mixed analog and digital\nintegrated circuit. The main parameters are listed in Table 7.\nTable 7\nSVXIIe properties.\nSVXIIe Property\n\nValue\n\nProcess technology\n\n1.2 micron CMOS\n\nChip size\n\n6.3 by 8.7 mm\n\nNumber of channels\n\n128\n\nMaximum interaction rate\n\n132 ns between interactions\n\nDetector input capacitance\n\n10 to 35 pF\n\nNumber of bits in ADC\n\nvariable up to 8 bits\n\nNumber of pipeline stages\n\n32\n\nPreamp dynamic range\n\n240 pC\n\nWilkenson ADC clock frequency\n\nMaximum of 53 MHz\n\nReadout clock frequency\n\nMaximum of 26.5 MHz\n\nOn chip zero suppression\n\nYes\n\nOn chip test pulser\n\nYes\n\nDaisy chained operation\n\nYes\n\nSimultaneous trigger and readout\n\nNo\n\nThe chip was designed by a collaboration of engineers at Fermilab and Lawrence\nBerkeley Laboratory, and it was fabricated in the UTMC radiation hard 1.2 \u03bcm\nCMOS technology. Each channel consists of an integrating preamplifier which\nconverts charge to voltage, a 32 deep pipeline which is implemented as a string\nof 32 capacitors, and an 8 bit Wilkensen type ADC. A simplified diagram of\n25\n\n\fone of the channels is shown in Fig. 14. All 128 channels are connected to a\ndata readout section which can either read out all channels, just those above\na digitally set threshold, or those above threshold plus one channel on either\nside of those above threshold. The latter mode can cross chip boundaries to\nadjacent chips mounted on the same HDI. The integrator integrates charge\ncontinuously until it is reset, but the charge into each pipeline capacitor is\nonly the increment in charge between beam crossings. This means that there\nis a correlated double sampler between the integrator and the pipeline, so that\nonly the change in charge between the previous beam crossing and the current beam crossing is put into a pipeline capacitor. The pipeline is controlled\nby two counters which are configured as ring counters which means that the\npipeline is a ring of capacitors. There is a write counter which points to the\nnext available capacitor in the ring. When a new beam crossing occurs, the\nvalue of the input signal is written into the capacitor pointed to by the write\ncounter. The read counter is identical to the write counter, but it is delayed\nby a down-loadable pipeline delay. The beam crossing clock that samples the\ncharge also steps the write pointer and the read pointer ring counters. If there\nis a trigger, the counters are stopped and the capacitor pointed to by the read\ncounter is digitized and read out.\nThe SVXIIe was designed to minimize both power consumption and detector\nmass. It consumes approximately 3 mW per channel and has only 19 connections to the outside world. This small number of connections was achieved by\nmaking the function of many of the lines mode dependent. For example, the\n8 bit readout bus is used for control functions in all modes but readout.\nA portion of the SVXIIe schematic containing the dynamic memory cell is\nshown in Fig. 15.\nThe chip has four modes of operation with only one mode active at a time.\nThis means that it is not possible for the chip to acquire data at the same\ntime it is digitizing or reading out other data.\nThe first mode is the download mode where settable parameters are loaded\ninto the chip. There are 190 bits in the download register for each chip. The\ndownload is implemented as a long serial shift register using only two chip\npads called top neighbor and bottom neighbor and the clock. Data are shifted\ninto the top neighbor pad and out of the bottom neighbor pad. The output\nfrom the last chip's bottom neighbor is read back into the sequencer. Thus,\na three chip HDI requires sending 570 bits over the MIL-STD-1553 link [9].\nThe chip does not have a read command to read the data back. The data shift\nthrough the chip string two or more times and the sequencer compares the\nread-back data to the input.\nThe second mode is acquire. In this mode, every time a clock pulse arrives, the\n26\n\n\fFig. 14. A block diagram of a single channel of the SVXIIe chip.\n\nchip samples the change in charge on the input capacitor and stores the data\ninto a pipeline capacitor. The ring counter pointers are incremented and the\nprocess is repeated. There is no specific trigger line. When a trigger occurs,\nthe sequencer stops the beam crossing clock and changes the mode to digitize.\nThe correct capacitor to digitize is pointed to by the read counter.\nDigitization is accomplished by transferring the charge from the selected capacitor onto a capacitor connected to a comparator. The pipeline capacitor is\nthen reset and the offset voltage is subtracted from the charge on the comparator capacitor. This minimizes any offsets that may be present in the pipeline.\nActual digitization is accomplished by putting a linear voltage ramp on the\nother input to the comparator and starting a counter at the same time. The\n53 MHz digitization clock increments this counter on both edges of the clock\npulse giving an effective clock rate of 106 MHz.When the ramp voltage reaches\nthe input value, the counter is stopped.\nThe final mode is readout. The counter values are shifted into a pipeline\nand the pipeline is compressed if zero suppression is enabled. Since the chip is\n27\n\n\fFig. 15. A portion of the SVXIIe schematic showing the dynamic memory cell.\n\ndesigned to be used in a multi-chip configuration, the readout bus is configured\nas a tri-state bus during readout. Control of the bus is passed between chips\nthrough the top neighbor and the bottom neighbor connections. A signal on\nthe top neighbor during readout gives the chip control of the output bus.\nWhen it is finished it signals the bottom neighbor to give control to the next\nchip or, if it is the last chip, to tell the sequencer that readout is done.\nOnce the pipeline has been compressed and the chip has control of the output\n28\n\n\fbus, the data is read out, one byte at a time. A 7 bit channel ID and an\n8 bit data word are read out on each cycle. The clock is run at one-half of\nthe normal 53 MHz, and data is read out on both edges of the clock. This\nreduces the bandwidth requirement on the readout cable but it places severe\nrestrictions on the clock duty cycle. Small changes in the clock duty cycle can\ncause one edge of the data strobe to be missed which then interchanges the\nchannel ID and data for the rest of the readout. In sparsification mode, when\nonly channels over a threshold are read out, this error is not easily detected.\nThe SVXIIe has a sophisticated method for testing itself and the entire downstream readout electronics. The test circuit, called cal inject, consists of a\ncapacitor connected by a switch to each of the front end channels at the input to the preamplifier. The switch is activated through a transition on bus\nline 7 in acquire mode. The 128 bit cal inject mask (1 bit per channel) is a\ndown-loadable parameter so all possible patterns can be generated. The pulse\namplitude can either be set by an external source or from an internal one\nthat is controlled by a 3 bit DAC. The DAC setting is also a down-loadable\nparameter.\nAll of the power connections are at the back of the chip, including the power for\nthe front end amplifiers. The chip's metal layers have too-high resistance for\nthe front end amplifiers to get enough power. A row of double wire bonds was\nmade along exposed sections of the upper metal layer connections for front end\namplifier power to reduce this resistence by creating parallel paths for current\nflow. The spacing of the exposed sections kept the wire bond distances reliably\nshort.\nEven though the average chip power consumption is low, the current varies\nby nearly a factor of two between an idle state and readout, so if there is\nno local monitoring of the voltage by the power supply, often referred to as\nremote sensing, there could be a substantial change in chip voltage. The layout\nof the system makes remote sensing quite difficult. One supply feeds a large\nnumber of HDIs. Two HDIs are fed through the 80-conductor cables. These\ncables have many different lengths since they had to be as short as possible\nin order to fit in the space between the central and end cryostats. Finally, the\nnumber of chips varies between HDIs. The best option was to locate the power\nsupplies as close to the detector as possible. The place with adequate space\nwas at the base of the central calorimeter near the interface boards. The local\nmagnetic field is about 200 G at this location, so the power supplies had to\nhave magnetic shielding. In addition, safe practice required fusing each power\nline for each of the three voltages for groups of four strings of SVXIIe chips.\nThis required a fuse panel with about 40 fuses at four locations at the base of\nthe calorimeter.\n29\n\n\fFig. 16. An HDI for a 9-chip detector (prior to folding and lamination).\n\n4.4 High Density Interconnect\nThe HDI is a two-layer flexible printed circuit with 50 \u03bcm polyimide with\n125\u03bcm line spacing and 50 \u03bcm vias. The circuits are laminated to beryllium\nheat spreaders. One HDI and its beryllium substrate are epoxied directly to\none silicon sensor. Precision notches machined into the heat spreaders provided\nthe alignment of the silicon ladders on the bulkhead. The HDI consists of\nSVXIIe chips, resistors, capacitors, and an interface circuit, which are mounted\nin the area which are in direct contact with the silicon sensor. The SVXIIe\nchips are wire bonded directly to the sensors. The second part of the HDI, the\npigtail, is the extension of the signal and power traces to the outer radius of\nthe silicon detector region.\nA picture of an HDI for a 9-chip detector is shown in Fig. 16.\nMultiple layer polyimide circuits with very fine spacings are difficult to make\nbecause the polyimide stretches easily. A ceramic HDI would require several\nlayers to provide the required number of signal, power, and ground planes.\nThe small number of connections on the SVXIIe and clever use of wire bonds\nmade it possible to make a polyimide HDI with only two layers. The output\nbus and control lines were laid out in a row of parallel lines in front of the\nstring of chips. Connections from each chip to the different lines were made\n30\n\n\fby running the wire bond over the intervening traces. Bypass capacitors were\nmounted outside the bus lines and longer wire bonds were used to connect to\nthe capacitors. Thus, the equivalent of a multilayer circuit was made with wire\nbonds. The longest wire bonds approach the maximum allowable length so if\nthere were many more lines to connect, this method would not have worked.\nSix different types of HDIs were needed to accommodate the various detector\nand readout geometries. In the case of double-sided ladder detectors, a single\ncircuit contained the readout for both the p- and n-sides with the polyimide\nfolded over to sandwich the sensor. The double-sided F-wedges have one separate HDI on each side. A single HDI would have implied daisy-chaining 14\nreadout chips, which was considered too risky in case of a chip failure and too\nexpensive in terms of readout time. The barrel detectors employ 9-chip HDIs\nfor the double-sided ladders, 6-chip HDIs for the 90-degree stereo ladders, and\n3-chip HDIs for the single sided ladders. The F-wedges are read out by an 8chip HDI for the p-side, and a 6-chip HDI for the n-side. Each single H-wedge\nis read out with one 6-chip HDI.\nAll HDIs have the same functionality. They provide one 8-bit data bus connecting all of the SVXIIe chips to the data path interface circuit, distribute the\ndifferential input clock and single-ended mode control signals to all the SVXIIe\nchips, distribute the various analog voltages required by the SVXIIe chips, and\nsilicon bias, and provide monitoring of the temperature of the beryllium heat\nspreader.\n\n4.5 Low Mass Cables and Adapter Card\n\nThe HDI readout cables are routed between the ladders in the barrel to a larger\nradius outside of the barrel vertex volume. There the pigtails are trimmed to\nlength and attached to the low-mass cables. The low-mass cables are flexcircuit striplines, to minimize the amount of material in the sensitive volume.\nThey were fabricated by Honeywell [11] and carry the digital signals and power\nbetween the hybrids and the adapter cards. To minimize any deterioration of\nthe clock signals, the clock signals are brought to the hybrids through minicoaxial cables. Signal traces and broad power and ground traces are located on\nboth sides of a polyimide dielectric about 100 \u03bcm thick. The low-mass cables\nare routed along the half-cylinder and coupled to the 80-conductor pleated foil\ncables at a ring of adapter cards located between the calorimeter cryostats.\nEach adapter card takes the signals from two HDIs and, without further signal\nprocessing, launches them on the high quality 80-conductor pleated foil cable\nto the interface board. The clock signals are carried by separate coaxial cables\nattached to the 80-conductor cable.\n31\n\n\f4.6 Interface Board\nThe interface board serves as a repeater for the signals between the SVXIIe\nand the sequencer. Each board handles up to eight detector modules. It also\nprovides the distribution of the bias voltage to the sensors, allows remote\ncontrol (on/off) of the power for the SVXIIe chips, and provides monitoring\nof the chip voltages, and currents.\nThe interface boards are housed in eight 9U\u00d7280 mm crates with custom backplanes, using 16\u201318 slots per crate. Two crates are placed at each of four\nlocations at the base of the central calorimeter.\nTemperatures of the beryllium heat spreaders are monitored on the interface\nboard. A jumper on the interface board provides a selectable temperature trip\nat 40\u25e6 C or 65\u25e6 C. The circuit is designed not to trip due to an open or short\ncircuit. Calibration is adjusted by a trim resistor and is accurate to about 1\u25e6 C.\nThe current limiters circuits for the HDI power connections were designed to\ntrip at 0.7 A in order to protect the wire bonds. Response time is a few ms.\nThe time constant for integrated signals (output of the current monitor) is of\norder 100 ms to avoid trips on glitches. Each HDI power line is monitored, in\ntotal 24 current limiter circuits per board.\nThe high voltage (HV) control for the detector bias is provided by the HDI enable circuit and photovoltaic relays (no moving parts) on the interface board.\nThere are two HV lines provided for each HDI to allow operation of doublesided sensors in split mode. HV is supplied via a 34-conductor twist-and-flat\nstrip cable to a connector on the backplane. For single-sided detectors, the\nprimary bias voltage is grounded and the secondary bias has a positive voltage. For double-sided detectors the primary bias is at +HV/2 or less and the\nsecondary bias at \u2212HV/2 or greater. This allows for asymmetric breakdown\ncharacteristics. The ground reference is the HDI ground. Bias current from\ngroups of four HDIs can be measured via the MIL-STD-1553 interface at any\ntime.\n\n4.7 Sequencer Controller\nThe sequencer controller (SEQC) is a 9U\u00d7340 mm Eurostyle module residing\nin each sequencer crate, used to give coarse timing commands to the SVXIIe\nsequencers which control acquisition and readout of the SVXIIe chips. It is\ndesigned to be plugged into slot 1 of the custom sequencer backplanes.\nThe controller receives beam crossing timing and triggering information via\n32\n\n\fa single coaxial cable called the Serial Command Link which originates at\nthe Trigger Framework 2 . Information from this link is interpreted and transformed into general SVXIIe data acquisition commands that go to each sequencer via the backplane. These commands are encoded onto a serial link\ncalled the NRZ (non-return-to-zero) link which is a 7-bit repetitive code sent\non dedicated backplane lines to each sequencer slot. These lines are used in\nconjunction with a dedicated differential 53 MHz clock sent to each sequencer\nslot. The seven bits are the framing bit, the crossing bit, four bits for an encoded data command, and the parity bit. The seven bit structure was chosen\nto remain synchronous with the Tevatron beam structure. A new code packet\nis sent every 132 ns. The framing bit is always set high and is monitored by\na state machine to ensure that the link is synchronized. The crossing bit is\nonly set if there is beam for that particular 132 ns period. The sixteen possible\nencoded data commands include commands such as Acquire, Preamp Reset,\nLevel 1 Accept, Digitize, Readout, and Readout Abort.\nThe NRZ link has an adjustable delay system to synchronize the crossing\ncommand with actual beam crossings so that SVXIIe charge acquisition happens at the optimal time with respect to beam. There are three delays, 132 ns,\n18.8 ns, and 2 ns steps, writable from a MIL-STD-1553 serial communication\nlink. This MIL-STD-1553 link is also used to set various diagnostic modes.\nTo prevent missed triggers, the SEQC sends a Busy signal back to the Trigger\nFramework based on a logical OR of busy signals from the sequencers. This\nis necessary because the SVXIIe chips may operate in sparsification mode,\nreading out only the channels over threshold, and readout may end at various\ntimes after a trigger. Since there is only one buffer on the SVXIIe, a new\ntrigger may be accepted only after readout has finished.\nA Diagnostic mode is provided to exercise the data acquisition system if the\nTrigger Framework signals are not operational. This mode is exercised via\nMIL-STD-1553 link.\n\n4.8 SVXIIe Sequencer\nThe basic task of the SVXIIe sequencers is to coordinate data acquisition in\nthe SVXIIe chips and serialize the resulting data onto high speed fibers to be\nsent to data storage.\nThe sequencers are 9U\u00d7340 mm circuit boards that reside in slots 2 through\n2\n\nThe Trigger Framework gathers digital information from each of the specific\nLevel 1 trigger devices and chooses whether a particular event is to be accepted\nfor further examination.\n\n33\n\n\f21 in six Eurocard crates on the detector platform. Geographic addressing\nis designed into the backplane for each slot for MIL-STD-1553 Remote Terminal identification. Each sequencer is connected to an interface board via\nfour 50-conductor 3M pleated-foil cables, a VRB via four optical fibers for\ndata readout, the SEQC via the backplane, and the control system via the\nMIL-STD-1553 link which is also plugged into the backplane.\nIn initialize mode, the sequencers interpret data from the MIL-STD-1553 data\nbus and then clock the appropriate download data pattern into the chips. This\npattern is readable from the chips only by shifting new data into the chips\nso a simultaneous download of all chips on an HDI must occur. In acquire\nmode, the sequencers advance the pipeline clock with each beam crossing, and\nthe SVXIIe chips' preamplifiers are reset during beam gaps. When a trigger\noccurs, a specific complex manipulation of the control signals occurs which\nextracts charge out of the correct pipeline cell, and then the sequencer sends\na 53 MHz clock which the chip uses to digitize this charge for each channel.\nIn readout mode, clocks are sent to the SVXIIe chip at 26.5 MHz, and the\nchip then sends alternately channel ID and data back to the sequencer. The\nsequencer serializes this data into a 1.062 Gb/s data stream, adds header and\ntrailer information, and sends it via optical fiber to the VRBs in the counting\nhouse.\nDiagnostic features are interfaced to the MIL-STD-1553 bus and include a\nsnapshot register to read the current state of important SVXIIe control lines\nand a built-in logic analyzer that records the same control lines for about 75 \u03bcs\nafter a selectable trigger. A pattern of 64 words may be written via the MILSTD-1553 link and sent to the VRBs for testing the gigabit links. The Finisar\nlaser [12] drivers' diagnostic links may be read via MIL-STD-1553, monitoring\npower output, temperature, and other parameters. Other MIL-STD-1553 link\nregisters include SVXIIe chip power on/off control, module serial number, and\na remote programming register.\nAn optional Readout Abort feature is used to guard against system hangups from non-responding chips. Normally the sequencers use the Priority Out\nhandshake signal from the last chip in a chain to determine when readout is\nfinished. If this handshake ever fails, a 45 \u03bcs timeout in the SEQC propagates\nto the sequencers and puts the system back in acquire mode, and Busy is\nreleased.\n\n4.9 VME Readout Buffer\n\nThe VME Readout Buffer (VRB) is a 9U\u00d7400 mm multiport memory that\nbuffers the data for transfer to the higher level data acquisition system. It\n34\n\n\fcontains ten independent input ports and a common VME output port. For\nSMT operation, eight channels on each board are used.\nThe VRB acts as a buffer as data wait for the conclusion from the second\ndecision level (Level 2) of the hardware trigger system [4]. Buffer management\nis provided by an external System Controller (VRBC) through a dedicated\ncontrol port. A controller serves up to 12 VRB modules in one VME crate.\nThe VRB receives data via serial optical connections from the sequencers via\nthe VTM which converts the optical signal to an electrical signal. Input data is\naccepted at an aggregate rate of approximately 500 MBytes/s on eight (bytewide) channels. The output rate is limited by VME transfer speeds and by the\nnumber of VRB modules sharing the VME bus. For SVXIIe chip applications,\nthe VRB inputs data at the accept rate of a few kHz from the first decision\nlevel (Level 1) of the hardware trigger, and outputs data at the Level 2 accept\nrate of less than 1 kHz.\nThe VRB Control Logic performs three basic functions: receive and process\nmessages from the system controller, return status signals to the system controller, and manage the general flow of data to and from the VRB buffers. The\nControl Logic will respond to a message by asserting a status signal, typically\nwithin 200 ns.\nUpon a Level 1 trigger accept, the VRBC supplies the VRB with a buffer\nnumber to store the input data. When the VRB Control Logic receives a\nmessage specifying the next input buffer, it looks up the buffer starting address\nin the shared memory, and broadcasts this information to the Receive Logic\nfor all channels. The input data is pushed to the VRB from the sequencer. The\nevent data from an SVXIIe chip is logically organized by words (2 bytes). The\nfirst bytes of each data stream contain a header inserted by the sequencer to\nidentify the data source. This is followed by a block of data from each SVXIIe\nchip containing the chip ID, status, and up to 128 pairs of channel number\nand data. The VRB input FIFO (First In First Out memeory configuration)\nwill accept data until it recognizes an End Of Record word. When all event\ndata is received, the VRB Control Logic will read the individual byte counts\nfrom each Receive Logic block and generate a global byte count for the event.\nThe global byte count is available to a VME Scan Processor so that it can\nperform a single block read operation to obtain all data for the event. When\nall the channels transmitting data to a VRB are done, the VRB will inform\nthe VRBC. This is accomplished by releasing a busy signal on a dedicated line\nof control bus. The busy line is an open collector signal that can be driven low\nby any of the VRBs in the crate. The transfer of the data from the SVXIIe to\nthe Level 2 buffer is finished when all VRBs have released signal on this line.\nFollowing a Level 2 Accept, the VRBC supplies the VRB with a buffer number\n35\n\n\ffor data output. Events that are accepted by the Level 2 trigger are copied\nto the VME output data FIFO. For events rejected by the Level 2 trigger,\nthe VRBC re-uses the buffer number, causing the previous event data to be\noverwritten.\n\n36\n\n\f5\n\nSilicon Sensors\n\nThe SMT detector uses a combination of single-sided, double-sided, and doublesided double-metal silicon sensors.\nSingle-sided and double-sided devices were produced from high resistivity 4\"\nsilicon wafers with crystal orientation < 111 > and < 100 >. The double-sided\ndouble-metal detectors were manufactured using < 100 > 6\" wafers. Isolation\non the n-side of all double-sided devices is provided by p-stop implants. AC\ncoupling aluminization was specified to be 2 \u03bcm inside the strip to limit edge\nfields which might cause micro-discharge breakdown. All traces are biased\nusing poly-silicon resistors.\nOf particular importance for the double-sided devices is the quality and robustness of the AC coupling capacitors, since these are required to isolate the\nreadout electronics from the detector depletion voltage. To minimize the stress\non these capacitors, the detectors are in general operated with the bias split\nbetween the n- and p-sides. The voltage ratio is limited by the micro-discharge\neffect discussed in Sec. 5.4. Table 8 summarizes the sensor locations and types,\nand Fig. 17 summarizes the geometry of the individual detectors.\n\nTable 8\nCharacteristics and deployment of various sensor types.

The geometry of all individual detectors showing their relative dimensions.\n\n5.1 Barrel Sensors\n\nThree types of sensors are used in the central barrels. The second and fourth\nlayers use double-sided stereo detectors with the n-side implants at a 2\u25e6 angle\nwith respect to the p-side axial strips. Two of these sensors are bonded together\nto form a 12 cm long ladder.\nOn the first and third layers of the outer barrels, single-sided sensors with axial\nstrips are used. Also in this case two sensors are bonded together to form a\n12 cm long ladder. The inner four barrels use 90\u25e6 stereo sensors. Ninety degree\nreadout was achieved using a second metal layer on the n-side insulated from\nthe first metal layer by 3 \u03bcm of PECVD (Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor\nDeposition) silicon oxide. Two readout strips on this side are multiplexed to\na single readout channel. Implants on the n-side are isolated by individual\np-stop frames in addition to a common p-stop enclosure. The use of 6\" silicon\n38\n\n\fwafers allowed production of 12 cm long DSDM sensors as single pieces.\n5.2 Disk Sensors\nThe disk sensors are trapezoids with readout strips arranged parallel to the\nlong edge of the devices. In this arrangement the strip length varies for strips\nwhich originate past the base of the trapezoid.\nThe F-disk detectors provide \u00b130\u25e6 stereo point measurements which provide\ngood impact parameter resolution in both r \u2212 \u03c6 and r \u2212 z.\nFor the H-disks, two detectors are bonded together to form the readout module. The strips of the inner and outer sensors are bonded together, leading to\na maximum strip length of 14.24 cm. The single-sided modules are assembled\nback-to-back on a beryllium substrate forming a 15\u25e6 stereo angle.\nIn both detector types, a small region in the upper corner of the device, where\nstrip lengths would be less than about 1 cm, is left unbonded.\n5.3 Sensor Production and Testing\nThe sensors were produced by three different vendors, Micron Semiconductor\nLTD [13], Elma [14], and Canberra Eurisys Mesures [15]. Those produced by\nMicron were tested at the Micron factory by D0 personnel; Elma sensors were\ntested at Moscow State University; and Eurisys sensors were tested by the\ncompany. The bulk of the sensors used in the experiment were produced by\nMicron and the testing of these sensors is described in more detail below.\nTable 9 summarizes the specifications for the Micron devices.\nOne of the most important electrical characteristics of the silicon sensors is the\ndepletion voltage. It was estimated by studying the capacitance-voltage relationship measured at a dedicated station at Micron. A typical measurement\nis shown in Fig. 18 where the inverse of the capacitance squared is plotted as\na function of bias voltage.The depletion voltage is given by the intersection of\nthe plateau, seen in figure, with the 1/C 2 slope.\nOther basic detector tests included:\n\u2022 measurement of IV characteristics and breakdown voltage\n\u2022 measurement of AC coupling capacitor value\n\u2022 measurement of AC coupling capacitor leakage and pinholes 3 to 100 V.\n3\n\nBroken AC coupling capacitors caused by flaws in the lithography could cause\n\n39\n\n\fTable 9\nSensor specifications for the double-sided sensors fabricated by Micron.\nParameter\n\nF-disks and DS sensors\n\nDSDM sensors\n\nUdepletion (V)\n\n20 < Udepletion < 60\n\n20 < Udepletion < 60\n\nTotal Ileakage @ Udepletion + 20V\n\n< 10\u03bcA\n\n< 10\u03bcA\n\nUbreakdown defined as I = 15\u03bcA\n\n> 100 V\n\n> 100 V\n\nCcoupling\n\n> 15 pF/cm\n\n> 15 pF/cm\n\np-side Ccoupling failures\n\n< 2% /side\n\n< 2% /side\n\nn-side Ccoupling failures\n\n< 2% /side\n\n< 4% /side\n\nRbias\n\n1 M\u03a9 < Rbias < 10 M\u03a9\n\n1 M\u03a9 < Rbias < 10 M\u03a9\n\nRbias uniformity\n\n\u00b125%\n\n\u00b125%\n\nRinterstrip\n\n> 100 M\u03a9\n\n> 100 M\u03a9\n\nFig. 18. 1/C 2 as a function of the bias voltage for a 9-chip sensor.\n\nFigure 19 shows the yield of good strips for accepted sensors for DS ladders\nand F-wedges.\nholes in the insulator.\n\n40\n\n\fFig. 19. The yield of good strips for accepted detectors for DS ladders (solid line)\nand F-wedges (dashed line).\n\nSeveral problems were encountered during production which necessitated more\ndetailed testing. Several devices showed regions of low interstrip resistance.\nThis seemed to depend not only on device processing but also post-processing\nhandling. These areas could be detected by current and resistance measurements on the DC contacts of the individual strips, and these tests were instituted for all detectors. Several detectors exhibited high leakage currents after\nthe AC coupling capacitor tests. These detectors were cleaned and retested\nand accepted if the currents returned to previous levels.\nEarly in the production phase of the double-metal detectors some sensors\nwere found with regions which exhibited large noise and high strip currents.\nBy visual inspection, it was found that these regions were associated with\nflaws in the island p-stops on the n-side. These were traced to areas where the\np-stop isolation implants were contacting the n+ strip-defining implants with\nno intervening bulk material. In-process testing of n-side strips at Micron was\nintroduced to identify these problems at an early stage of the processing. A\nstrip current limit of 1 \u03bcA at 80 V was used to identify p-stop problems and\nno detectors were accepted with more than one such flaw.\n\n5.4 Micro-discharge\nDuring the initial production testing, a number of devices were found that\nexhibited breakdown which depended on the voltage applied to the p-side\nof the device. The breakdown was due to \"micro-discharge\" [16]: avalanche\nbreakdown of the p-n junction when the potential between the negatively\n41\n\n\fFig. 20. N-side micro-discharge breakdown threshold for barrel layer DSDM detectors (solid line) and F-disk detectors (dashed line).\n\nbiased p-implant and grounded AC pad increases the junction field. This was\nconfirmed by measuring the temperature dependence of the associated current,\nwhich increases with decreasing temperature due to the increase in carrier\nmobility. The threshold for this breakdown varied from detector to detector\nand was worst for those devices which had obviously misaligned implants\nand AC coupling strips. The threshold for the breakdown was affected by\nthe amount of fixed positive oxide charge which increases the effective field\nnear the p-n junction. The existence of this breakdown made it necessary\nto characterize each device by the maximum p-side voltage which could be\nsustained without breakdown, as illustrated in Fig. 20. The detectors were\nthen biased asymmetrically depending on this voltage.\nBare sensors were tested at the Fermilab booster irradiation facility (8 GeV\nprotons) and the neutron irradiation facility at Lowell, MA, USA (one MeV\nneutrons). In addition, ladders were tested to 2 Mrad in the Fermilab booster.\nIn general the sensors behaved as expected from the Hamburg model [17] of\nreverse annealing and with a current damage constant of \u03b1 = 3.3\u00d71017 A/cm2 .\nThe one exception to this behavior was the DSDM detectors, which exhibit\nanomalously rapid increase in depletion voltage with respect to the 2\u25e6 and\ndisk detectors as can be seen in Fig. 21. Diode test structures from the same\n6\" wafers were also irradiated in the Fermilab booster. The behavior of these\ntest structures was consistent with that of the detectors without double met42\n\n\fFig. 21. Depletion voltage as a function of dose.\n\nalization, indicating that the anomalous behavior is likely associated with the\nPECVD layer utilized in the double metal process.\nThe onset of micro-discharge will likely limit the lifetime of the SMT. After\ntype inversion, the breakdown moves with the junction from the p- to the nside of the sensors. For a junction on the n-side, trapped positive charge in the\noxide tends to reduce the field at the junction and the onset voltage of microdischarge is consequently higher on the n-side of an irradiated device than on\nthe p-side of the same detector before inversion. Figure 22 shows the noise\nassociated with the onset of micro-discharge after irradiation. Micro-discharge\nwill limit the practical operating voltage of the DSDM detectors to about 75\nto 100 V/side.\nAn assessment of the radiation damage with an estimate of the expected lifetime is described in Sec.10.\n\n43\n\n\fFig. 22. Noise as a function of bias voltage at different temperatures.\n\n6\n\nProduction of Ladders and Wedges\n\nThe large scale production of silicon detectors was a challenge for the D0\ncollaboration. A total of 1392 assemblies, which came in five different types,\nwere required for building the SMT. In addition, the need for left and righthanded species of all the ladders also increased the complexity of the production work. This number excludes the up to 20% spare modules which were\nbuilt. The large number turned the module assembly into a mass production\nwhich only functioned smoothly because of well defined procedures for the\nassembly processes.\nAll ladder and wedge modules were produced at the Silicon Detector Facility\n(SiDet) at Fermilab. This facility provided large clean room areas equipped\nwith optical Coordinate Measurement Machines (CMM) and automatic bonding machines.\n\n6.1 Production of 3-, 6-, and 9-chip Ladders\nSince the basic layouts of the barrel ladders are very similar, these various\nladder assemblies exploited almost identical techniques. The 3-chip ladders\nconsist of two single sided sensors with an on-board mounted HDI for three\nreadout chips. Their production was a one-stage process and therefore rather\nstraightforward, so this assembly will not be described here. The 6- and 944\n\n\fFig. 23. Schematic design of a double-sided silicon ladder, isometric view.\n\nchip ladders however, employed double-sided silicon which made the use of a\ntwo-stage production process with special fixturing for fold- and flip-over necessary. In the following sections, the successful two-stage production assembly\nis described.\n6.1.1 The Generic Double-sided Ladder Layout of the SMT Barrel Detectors\nThe basic design of the 9-chip double-sided ladders is shown in Fig. 23. The\nisometric drawing shows a 9-chip ladder with 5 and 4 readout chips on the pand n-side respectively. The two silicon sensors are ganged by wire-bonds and\nsupported by carbon fiber rails. The HDI, laminated on the beryllium pieces\nprior to ladder assembly, was wrapped around the two surfaces of the silicon\nand connected to the silicon strips on both sides of the sensors. Figure 24\nshows an elevation view of the on-board mounted readout assembly.\n6.1.2 The Assembly Components and Assembly Preparations\nSensors used for ladder production were selected according to the results from\nthe measurements described in Sec. 5. In the case of 3- and 9-chip ladders,\nwhich consist of two sensors, the depletion voltage of the individual sensors\nwas matched.\nThe selected sensors were visually inspected to ensure a clean surface on the\nbonding pads prior to the assembly process. Spots of organic residue on sen45\n\n\fFig. 24. Schematic design of a double-sided silicon ladder, elevation view. Note that\nthe vertical size is not drawn to scale.\n\nsors, in particular on the AC-bonding pads, caused a few unreliable bonds.\nBeryllium was chosen as the heat spreader material due to its excellent thermal\nand electrical properties, its high specific stiffness, and its very long radiation\nlength. The beryllium pieces used in the ladder design were machined into their\nfinal shapes by the supplier [18], so that no further machining was necessary\nat Fermilab.\nThree different beryllium substrates were used in the assembly process of the\nladders. The \"active cooled\" and \"passive\" beryllium pieces were positioned\non the p-side of the sensor, whereas the beryllium \"top plate\" was located on\nthe n-side. The typical thickness of the beryllium substrates is 400 \u03bcm for the\nladders. The beryllium pieces aid in stiffening the ladder, provide an improved\nthermal path, and serve handling and reference purposes. The active and the\npassive beryllium pieces were used for the alignment. They have precisely\nmachined notches at the side (machining accuracy of notch surface \u00b15 \u03bcm) in\norder to locate a ladder into a barrel by press fitting one of the notches of each\nberyllium piece into machined posts at the bulkhead surface. All beryllium\npieces were visually inspected prior to lamination and the specified mechanical\ndimensions measured. The thickness was determined at five different points.\nThe 50 \u03bcm flatness specification of the substrates was verified, and the upper\ntolerance of the notch-notch distance was checked with each beryllium piece\non a small fixture.\nThe HDIs were laminated to the active and top plate beryllium pieces by\nusing a 25 \u03bcm thick film and a 75 \u03bcm thick adhesive film [19]. An additional\nthermally and electrically conductive path through silver epoxy loaded holes\nin the HDI was provided so that the beryllium pieces could remove the heat\nload of the SVXIIe chips and be kept on a common system ground.\nThe beryllium substrates also help to maintain the flatness of the HDI. The\ntwo beryllium (active and passive) pieces with the locating notches were con46\n\n\fnected by two support rails, each consisting of a carbon/boron fiber, Rohacell\nfoam, carbon/boron fiber sandwich. These rails were glued to the silicon ladder parallel to the long side in order to make the ladder stable and stiff.\nThe carbon/boron fiber composite was designed to match the thermal expansion coefficient of the silicon. The carbon fiber support rails also serve as low\nimpedance connections in order to ground the passive beryllium piece at the\nladder's end.\nFor each 3-, 6-, or 9-chip ladder, there were two basic ladder types produced:\nleft-handed (LH) and right-handed (RH) ladders. Both types were produced in\nequal number. They differ by the relative orientation of the beryllium notches\nin the bulkhead posts with respect to the orientation of the ladder axis 4 .\nTwo different fixtures were employed for RH and LH ladders. These assembly\nfixtures were made out of either aluminum or steel and were coated with a\nlayer of Teflon to allow a gentle sliding of the silicon sensors for accurate\nalignment.\nThe fixtures had pushers at the side to exactly place the silicon sensors with\nrespect to the glass scale targets on the fixture. Additional steel posts had\nbeen inserted into the fixture in order to press fit the notches of the active\nand passive beryllium pieces against these posts. Spring loaded clamps on the\nfixture supported the press fit by pushing the beryllium notches against the\nposts. All the alignment and assembly of the silicon ladders was done under\ncontrol of a CMM.\nBefore ladder production started, the final position of the glass scales and the\nsteel inserts on the fixtures was determined in an iterative procedure. The\nqualification process included the assembly and measurements of test ladders\nas well as the fixture targets until the resulting distances between the notch\nedges of the beryllium and the silicon center axis defined by the silicon targets\nconverged to within the desired specifications of 5 \u03bcm.\n\n6.1.3 Ladder Production\nBefore the assembly started the components were tested. The testing procedure is discussed in Sec. 7.\nThe first stage of the assembly, Stage-I, of a 6- or 9-chip ladder was the alignment of the silicon sensor piece(s) on the assembly fixture under the control\nof an optical CMM. The axial strip side (p-side) of the silicon faced up. Once\nthe silicon was aligned, the vacuum on the fixture was turned on to keep the\nsensors in position. The alignment was then verified with the CMM, and if\n4\n\nIn addition, the LH and RH ladders have two different HDI tail lengths.\n\n47\n\n\fFig. 25. Schematic drawing of a 9-chip ladder resting on the Stage-I assembly fixture.\n\nneeded, the sensors were readjusted in order to keep their position uncertainty\nbelow 5 \u03bcm.\nHEXCEL epoxy glue was applied onto one film laminated beryllium carrier\npiece of the HDI and onto the smaller passive beryllium piece at the other end\nof the ladder. An exact amount of epoxy controlled by a glue dispenser was\nused and the glue was distributed in a fish-bone-like pattern on the beryllium\npieces to ensure an evenly spread glue joint. The HDI with the laminated\nberyllium pieces was then glued onto the silicon surface. It was checked that\nthe spring loaded pushers were pushing the notches of the active and passive\nberyllium pieces tightly against the steel posts in the fixture. Figure 25 shows\na schematic drawing of a 9-chip ladder resting on the Stage-I fixture. Figure 26\nis a photograph of a 9-chip ladder on that fixture.\nAfter setting special gluing weights above the adhesive joints between HDI\nand silicon, the ladder alignment was rechecked with the CMM. The gluing\nweights were applied for at least twelve hours. The thickness of the glue joint\nafter the epoxy is about 75 \u03bcm.\nAfter curing of the glue, the sensor was bonded to the readout chips and \u2013 in\ncase of the 3- and 9-chip ladders \u2013 sensor to sensor bonds were made using the\nsame assembly fixture as a bonding jig. A visual inspection of the wire bonds\nfollowed after each bonding step. The carbon/boron fiber rails were then glued\non the silicon ladder connecting the active and passive beryllium piece with\na low impedance path. The rails were glued using the same HEXCEL epoxy\nonto the silicon sensors, whereas the adhesive joint to the beryllium plates was\nmade by small amounts of conductive silver epoxy.\n48\n\n\fFig. 26. A photograph of a 9-chip ladder on the Stage-I fixture.\n\nIn the second assembly stage, Stage-II, the ladder was flipped to the n-side\nusing a special pickup fixture. The HDI was folded over and centered onto\nthe n-side of the silicon sensor with the help of spring loaded pushers at the\nStage-II fixture. The second part of the HDI serving the n-side was then glued\nwith HEXCEL epoxy to the sensor, and another gluing weight was applied\nduring the curing cycle. After this, the sensor to sensor bonds on the n-side\nand the bonds to the readout chips were done.\nThe production times of the ladders depended on the ladder type. The single\nsided 3-chip ladders could be produced within one day. The double-sided 6-chip\nladders, having only one sensor, could be fabricated within two days, while\nalmost three days were necessary for the production of double-sided 9-chip\nladders due to the additional sensor to sensor bonds. While the individual\nproduction time of a ladder was mainly determined by the curing time of\nthe glue, the overall pace of the ladder fabrication was dominated by the\navailability of the parts and components. Duplicate sets of assembly fixtures\nand up to four CMM machines with mounted fixtures were used to keep up\nwith the tight production schedule. The number of assembled ladder modules\nversus time is shown in Fig. 27.\n6.1.4 Mechanical Accuracy of the Ladders\nSince the ladders were inserted into the bulkheads by pressing the notches of\nthe active and passive beryllium pieces against the bulkhead posts, the final\nlocation of the ladder in the bulkhead and hence the axial alignment of the\nsilicon strips are determined by these two notches. Any tilt between the two\nberyllium notches with respect to the silicon strips leads to a misalignment.\nThe achieved mechanical accuracy in the ladder assembly is shown in Fig. 28.\nFigure 28a and b show the maximum tilt between the active and passive ends\n49\n\n\fNumber of Modules\n\nDate\n\nFig. 27. Production of ladders and wedges as function of time. The overall production pace was mainly determined by the availability of the parts.\n\nFig. 28.

The flatness measurements were\nperformed on an optical metrology machine. Almost all ladders are well below\n50 \u03bcm, which is the maximum radial displacement permitted for the inner\nlayer.\n50\n\n\f6.2 F-Disk Wedge Production\n6.2.1 Gluing Process\nQualified sensors and HDIs were selected to be glued together. The HDI was\nmounted on the same carrier bar that was used for testing and shipping.\nThis bar was also used to help handle the HDI for the gluing procedure.\nThere were two important considerations for the gluing process: a) relative\nalignment of the sensor to the HDI, and b) the thickness of the glue joint\nsuch that good contact was insured. The process was performed on a specially\nmachined fixture that was mounted on a CMM.\nTo control the thickness of the glue, the thicknesses of the HDI substrate as\nwell as the silicon sensor had to be known. The silicon sensor thickness as\nmeasured by the manufacturer was used but the HDI thickness was measured\ndirectly. Once the thicknesses were known, the correct thickness gauge blocks\nwere chosen to mount on the fixture. The HDI was mounted on top of these\ngauge blocks in the fixture on the CMM. A coordinate system was defined from\nthe HDIs fixed on the gluing fixture, with the x (y) coordinate being in the\ndirection of the base (length) of the wedge, and the z coordinate perpendicular\nto the sensor surface.\nThe sensor was mounted on a flat pedestal and secured via a vacuum connection. This pedestal could be translated or rotated relative to the HDI using\ntwo micrometer adjustable screws. The plane height in the z direction was\nfixed relative to the HDI. The alignment of the silicon relative to the HDI\ncoordinate system was performed using two fiducial marks on the sensor. The\nfirst fiducial was in the center of the sensor right next to the HDI, the second\nwas at the center-most part of the wedge as it would be placed on a disk. An\niterative procedure was performed using the micrometer screws to allow both\nfiducials to line up at the correct places. This alignment was done to better\nthan 5 \u03bcm in the x \u2212 y plane.\nThe same epoxy that was used for ladders was used to glue the wedges. The\nHDI was held down onto the silicon using spring loaded screws and left to\ncure overnight. After curing, the alignment was verified before the vacuum\nwas released so that the new F-wedge could be dismounted from the gluing\nfixture and stored in its handling box. Because there are bias bonding pads on\nthe very corner parts of the wedge, an extra step was taken to inject glue at\nthese points. A trained technician using a small bore syringe performed this\nprocedure.\nA total of four gluing fixtures were made so that four F-wedges could be glued\nper day. The alignment and gluing procedure for these wedges could be completed in one hour during the afternoon. The subsequent corner gluing and\n51\n\n\fvisual inspection took another hour the following morning. Once the procedures were developed, there were very few problems during gluing. The main\nproblem was assuring that the sensor did not come into contact with the alignment pin on the fixture during dismounting. The yield for this procedure over\nthe entire production was over 90%.\n\n6.2.2 Channel Bonding\nThe F-wedges have a double-sided silicon sensor with one HDI with eight chips\non one side and another HDI with six chips on the other side. On the side with\nsix chips there was also a jumper, which is a pitch adapter to adapt from the\nchip spacing to the silicon spacing. Four production wire bonding operations\nwere needed for each wedge. First the bonding from the chips to the sensors\nwas done on the 8-chip side. Then the detector was turned over to the 6-chip\nside and the bondings from the chips to the jumper and from the jumper to\nthe sensor were done. Finally the bias bonds to the detectors on both sides\nwere attached. The total number of wire bonds for all wedges is about 370,000.\nThe 8-chip channel bonds were bonded using automatic wire bonding machines. This procedure took approximately 20 minutes per wedge. Only minor\nproblems were encountered with this operation during development when the\nautomatic bonder operating parameters were being determined.\nThe wedge-to-wedge height differences and non-similar jumper surfaces on the\n6-chip side made the wire bonding on the jumper side more problematic. Because of the awkwardness in bonding to the jumper, both of the bonding steps\non the 6-chip side of the wedge were performed on semi-automatic bonding\nmachines. The wedge was placed into a vacuum fixture for these steps. Bonding parameters occasionally had to be readjusted during this process, but the\nbonding was accomplished with very few unbondable channels. The two wire\nbonding steps on the 6-chip side took on average 45 minutes to one hour to\ncomplete.\nThe bias bonds are located on the corners of the sensor where the amount of\nglue underneath the sensor made the bonding difficult and therefore the bias\nbonds were made using a manual bonding machine.\nAside from the wire bonding technician, another technician helped to mount\nand dismount wedges from the fixtures and perform the quality assurance\nprocedures. The majority of problems encountered were due to mishandling\nof the wedges in the fixtures. Only one misalignment on the wire bonding\nmachine broke a wedge. Only very minor problems were encountered with\nquality assurance of the bonding itself. These included tool marks and some\nwire bonds that broke after bonding.\n52\n\n\fFig. 29. Simplified configuration of the single-sided half wedge of an H-disk.\n\n6.3 H-Disk Wedge Production\n\nThe H-disk wedges are two-layered and each wedge is composed of two singlesided half wedges which were glued back-to-back. A simplified configuration\nof the half wedge is shown in Fig. 29. Each half wedge consists of inner and\nouter silicon sensors mounted on a beryllium plate.\nThe single sided silicon sensors are shaped as trapezoids; their strips are parallel to one of the trapezoid's sides. The strips of the inner and outer sensors were\nbonded together, leading to a maximum strip length of 14.24 cm. A beryllium\nplate was attached on top of the outer sensor providing a mounting surface for\nfront end readout electronics installed on the HDI. The HDI was laminated in\na similar way to the barrel ladders on top of the beryllium plate. The outer\nsensor strips were connected with the input pads of the chips with wire bonds.\nA special silicon based pitch adapter, fabricated from the same wafer as the\nwedge sensor, was used. A part of the top beryllium plate surface of one of\nthe half-wedges was used for mounting of the wedge on the cooling ring of the\ndisk. A full wedge module was produced by joining together two half wedges\nback-to-back.\n\n6.3.1 Wedge Production for the H-Disks\nBefore assembly started, silicon sensors, beryllium substrates, and HDI flex\ncircuits were thoroughly tested. Every step of the assembly process was followed by an electrical test of the subassembly. The half wedge assembly process\n53\n\n\fstarted with lamination of the flex HDI circuits on the beryllium substrates.\nTo adhere a large area of the outer silicon sensor to the beryllium plate, a\nthermal conductive tape based on an acrylic adhesive (3M9882) was used.\nThis allowed stress relief on the silicon during assembly and cooling of the\ndetector during operation. The substrates were aligned and bonded onto an\nouter silicon sensor using special assembly fixtures. To bond the inner silicon\nsensor to beryllium, the epoxy adhesive HEXCEL was used, the same type\nas was used in the ladder assembly process. The sensor alignment was done\nunder CMM control. Wire bonding of the wedges was done in two steps. First,\nthe SVXIIe chips were bonded to the pads on the HDI circuits. Second, the\ninput pads of the chips were wire bonded to the strips from the outer sensor\nvia a pitch adapter on the HDI, and the strips from the outer sensors were\nwire bonded to the corresponding strips of the inner sensor. All wire bonds\nwere encapsulated on each of the half wedges to prevent damage during their\nassembly and installation on the mounting ring. A special bi-facial machine\nconsisting of two co-axial microscopes was developed to align and bond together two half wedges back-to-back with precision better than 15 \u03bcm. The\nassembled wedges were installed on the beryllium cooling channel ring using\nthe rotary table of a CMM with a precision of 25 \u03bcm.\n\n54\n\n\f7\n\nTesting of Ladders and Wedges\n\nThorough testing of each ladder and wedge at various stages of the production\nwas required to avoid costly or even impossible back-tracking during the detector assembly. This section describes the procedures by which the modules\nwere electrically tested during production and the criteria used in assigning an\nelectrical grade to the finished detector modules. A more detailed description\ncan be found in Ref. [20].\n\n7.1 Testing Sequence\nThe essential building blocks of a detector module are the silicon sensors,\nthe SVXIIe chips, and the HDIs. Each component was tested as described in\nSec. 5, 7.2, and Sec. 7.3. The production testing sequence is described below,\nand can be summarized as follows:\n(1) Bare HDIs that passed the functionality test at the manufacturer were\nsent to Fermilab for long-term testing.\n(2) Sensors and burned-in HDIs were assembled into a detector module.\n(3) Detector modules underwent initial functionality test.\n(4) Detector modules that passed the initial functionality test were burnedin.\n(5) Burned-in detector modules were laser tested.\n(6) Detector modules were assigned an electrical grade.\n(7) At each stage of the production sequence, malfunctioning modules were\nsent to be repaired.\nDebugging and repair was done by expert physicists; the burn-in and laser tests\nwere operated by non-expert physicists on shift with experts, who coordinated\nthe activities and helped with the set-up of the tests. Detailed instructions of\nthe daily activities and the procedures to be followed proved to be crucial\nto the operation, as was the meticulous bookkeeping of all activities. In the\nfollowing sections, each step of the production testing sequence is described\nin detail. The overall yield of detector production was about 85%. The lost\ndetectors failed to pass either electrical or mechanical tests.\n\n7.2 Testing of the SVXIIe Chips\nThe SVXIIe chips were produced on 12.7 cm wafers, with 148 usable dice on\neach wafer. A total of 206 wafers were produced and 155 of those were tested\nusing an automatic probe station. One-hundred-twenty wafers were tested in\n55\n\n\fthe first half of 1997 (first batch), and 35 wafers were tested in the spring of\n2000 (second batch). The testing and analysis procedures were identical for\nboth groups of wafers.\nThe testing procedure consisted of driving all chip inputs with a computerspecified pattern, sampling the output lines, and checking that the output\nstates were correct. The tests were separated into three categories: digital,\nanalog, and miscellaneous. The digital tests exercised the readout and pipeline\nsections of the chip and checked that the chip current draw was within specifications for all supply voltages. The analog tests exercised the front-end preamplifiers and pipeline amplifiers, in both positive and negative modes. Pedestals\nand gains were measured for all 32 pipeline buckets for each of the 128 channels. Finally, the miscellaneous tests exercised all of the auxiliary registers,\nwhich control the calibration voltage, the ramp rate used for digitization, the\ninput bandwidth, the pedestal level, and finally the chip bias current.\nA probe station was used to physically position the wafer so that the probe\ncard made contact with a specific die. One die was processed at a time; all\nthe tests were run on that die, then the probe station moved the next die into\ncontact with the probe card. Once the tests were completed, the wafer was\ndiced and chips visually inspected for mechanical damage, such as scratched\nsurfaces and missing corners. Two wafers were broken during the dicing process. 17593 chips (77%) passed the digital tests, 14701 chips (64%) passed\nthe analog and miscellaneous tests, and 13988 chips (61%) passed the visual\ninspection after dicing and were distributed. The yields from the first and\nsecond wafer batches were the same.\n\n7.3 Testing of Bare HDIs\n\nThe HDIs are a two layer, 0.127 mm thick flex circuit of polyimide film with\ngold/nickel plated copper pads. The requirements of 0.127 mm wide pads and\n0.051 mm wide via feedthroughs made the HDI a technical challenge for production. The tests checked for continuity and shorts between each of the pads\non the front end and the 28 lines of the tail. This was accomplished through\nthe use of a Ruker & Kolls semi-automated wafer probe station, controlled\nthrough GPIB interface with a PC running LabView. Given a coordinate map\nof the HDI circuit, the probe station stage positioned each pad under a probe\ntip. Connection was made through a GPIB multiplexing box, and a GPIB\ncontrolled multimeter checked for continuity or shorts between the appropriate line on the tail and the probe.Approximately 60 pads were checked per\nSVXIIe chip mount point on the circuit.\nThe yields of good bare HDIs varied significantly between vendors and pro56\n\n\fduction batches. Litchfield Precision Components [21] had a very low yield of\n\u2248 30% after \"fixing\" (zapping the shorts with a high current). Dyconex [22]\nonly delivered HDIs after internal testing, thus delivering good parts with excellent yield, but at a significantly higher price. A good compromise between\ncost and yield was finally reached with two additional vendors: Speedy [23]\nand Compunetics [24]. Obtaining working bare HDIs was one of the major\nissues of the early stages of the SMT production.\n\n7.4 PC Based Test Stands\n\nAll the electrical tests performed on readout HDIs and detector modules used\nthe same type of test stand, based on the Stand Alone Sequencer Board\n(SASeq), developed at Fermilab. The SASeq-based test stands were developed independently from the full D0 readout system. They were replicated\nand distributed at various locations at Fermilab and at remote institutes long\nbefore the final version of the full readout system was available. Using the\nPC-based version of the readout system proved crucial to the success of the\nproduction testing effort. The test stations used for the burn-in could operate 16 HDIs or detector modules at once. Separate one-SASeq test stands\nwere also built which could read out two devices at once. The one-SASeq test\nstands were used for initial functionality tests of HDIs, debugging of detector\nmodules, laser tests, repair, and for barrel/disk assembly. Nine stations were\nset up at the Fermilab Silicon Detector Facility, and three more stations were\navailable at remote institutes.\nThe hardware configuration for the burn-in stations is shown in Fig. 30. It\nconsisted of a VME crate that contained a Bit-3 VME controller card, eight\nSASeqs, a scanning 12-bit 64 channel analog-to-digital converter board (VME3113A) for current and temperature measurement, and a master vertical interconnect board for high voltage crate control. The two-channel SASeq board\nwas a self-contained data acquisition card designed to interface to the SVXIIe\nchips. Its basic functions were to control the SVXIIe chip for data acquisition,\ncollect the data when a data cycle was requested, and to relay the data to the\nprocessor in the crate. The crate also housed eight interface cards (IC). Each\nIC had two independent channels and was used as a bi-directional interconnect between the SASeq and the HDIs. The IC provided the control of the\nSVXIIe \"power on\" and \"power off\" sequence and prepared the monitoring\nof currents corresponding to the three SVXIIe operating voltages and to the\ntemperature measurement.\nEach SASeq was connected to an IC by a 3 m long, 50-conductor cable with\nan impedance of 82 \u03a9. Three low voltage power supplies were used to supply\nthe three operating voltages needed by the SVXIIe chips. An SVXIIe voltage\n57\n\n\fCooling Rack\nVME-3113A\n\nSASEQ #8\n\nSASEQ #7\n\nSASEQ #6\n\nSASEQ #5\n\nSASEQ #4\n\nSASEQ #3\n\nSASEQ #2\n\nSASEQ #1\n\nVertical Interconnect\n\nBit-3\n\nReadout VME Crate\n\nch1\n\nch2\n\nInterface Card #8\n\nInterface Card #7\n\nInterface Card #6\n\nInterface Card #5\n\nInterface Card #4\n\nInterface Card #3\n\nInterface Card #2\n\nInterface Card #1\n\nLow Voltage/SVX Power\nDistribution Panel\n\nch3\n\nch4\n\nch13\n\nch14\n\nBias Voltage Distribution Panel\n\nVME 4877PS\n\nVME 4877PS\n\nVME 4877PS\n\nVME 4877PS\n\nVertical Interconnect\n\nch15\n\nch16\n\nConnector\nHDI\nAdapter\n\nSi\n\nConnector\nHDI\nAdapter\n\nSi\n\nConnector\nHDI\nAdapter\n\nSi\n\nConnector\nHDI\nAdapter\n\nSi\n\nConnector\nHDI\nAdapter\n\nSi\n\nConnector\nHDI\nAdapter\n\nSi\n\nConnector\nHDI\nAdapter\n\nSi\n\nConnector\nHDI\nAdapter\n\nSi\n\nNitrogen/Water\nDistribution Panel\n\nHigh Voltage VME Crate\n\nFig. 30. Burn-in test setup. For debugging/repair/laser stations only one SASeq/IC\npair was used, and no cooling was provided.\n\npower distribution panel was located between the power sources and the IC\ncrate and was used for the distribution of the SVXIIe power and the interface\nboard power for each of the eight IC.\nBias voltage was provided independently for each detector module via a bias\nvoltage distribution panel. The panel was located between the high voltage\nsources and the IC crate. A set of switches on the panel allowed for three\ndifferent schemes for the biasing of double-sided detectors: positive bias applied to the n-side, negative bias applied to the p-side, and \"split bias,\" in\nwhich both positive and negative bias was applied at the same time to the nand p-side, respectively. The burn-in stations needed a separate VME crate to\nhouse the high voltage sources to bias the detectors. For the one-SASeq test\nstations, the HV module was connected to the same VME crate as the SASeq.\nThe HV VME crate for the burn-in stations contained four VME 4877PS [25]\nmotherboards and a slave vertical interconnect board for high voltage crate\n58\n\n\fcontrol. Every motherboard carried eight HV pods. Thus the HV crate provided 16 positive and 16 negative independent voltages for silicon detector\nbiasing and supported the current monitoring. The 4877PS Motherboard allowed the voltage to be set from 0 to 5000 V, with a maximum current of\n2 mA per channel. To ensure the safe operation of the burn-in stations, the\nover-voltage hardware protection of the HV supply was set to 120 V.\nDuring testing, the HDI tails were inserted into Hirose connectors on the\nconnector adapter boards. These boards contained the standard 3M 50 pin\nconnectors and the Hirose connectors and were used as connector adapters\nbetween the signal cables coming from the ICs and the HDI tails. The ICs\nwere connected to the adapter board by a 3 m long, 50-conductor coaxial\nribbon cable with an impedance of 75 \u03a9.\nThe burn-in stations were outfitted with a cooling system to operate the detectors at low temperature. Up to 16 detectors were placed on shelves inside\na regular rack that had been thermally isolated. The chiller temperature was\nset to 3\u25e6 C, and the detectors ran at temperatures between 5\u25e6 C and 15\u25e6 C,\ndepending on the number of chips on the HDI. Each detector module was\nplaced on a custom made, 178\u00d7229 mm aluminum plate, designed to accept\nall types of HDIs or detectors. Every aluminum plate was equipped with a\npipe for cooling water and special holes to provide nitrogen flow through the\nbox that enclosed the device under test. Two aluminum plates together with\nthe connector adapter boards and signal cables were placed on a plywood\nboard. This board was equipped with sliders to simplify loading and unloading of the devices under test. Plywood was chosen because it was a cheap, low\nthermo-conductive material that helped reduce the condensation on surfaces\ninside the rack. Every board had its own water and nitrogen pipe. The control\nover the water and gas flow was provided by a control panel outside the rack.\nA software based interlock system monitored the temperature on each device\nand shut down the power in the event that the temperature exceeded 50\u25e6 C.\nThe aim was to stay below the glass transition temperature of the epoxy to\navoid damage to the detector assembly.\n\n7.5 Testing of Detector Modules\n\nThe testing of detector modules was the first attempt to read out and bias a\ncompleted ladder or wedge detector after module assembly. The testing also\nincluded some remediation of issues and is thus also referred to as \"debugging.\" The likelihood for damage to occur during assembly, mainly during\nwire bonding, was substantial. About 25% of the assembled detectors failed\nto download or to read out correctly. In addition, the leakage current was unacceptably high for about 95% of the double-sided assembled detectors. The\n59\n\n\ffunctionality of the detectors had to be restored before any further tests were\ndone.\nFirst the modules were visually inspected to ensure that no mistakes had\nbeen made during wire bonding and no mechanical damage had occurred. The\nelectrical resistances between the active beryllium pieces and the HDI ground\nwere measured, and if a resistance was greater than 10 \u03a9, the grounding was\nimproved either with a small wire or directly with a silver epoxy trace.\nThe functionality test of the readout was done without applying bias to the detector. Download and readout failures were mainly caused by damaged SVXIIe\nchips, misplaced or missing wire bonds, or damaged HDIs. About 10% of the\nSVXIIe chips had to be replaced.\nOnce a detector module had been successfully read out, it was biased. The\nbiasing scheme depended on the type of detector under consideration. For\nthe single-sided detectors, positive bias was applied to the n-side, with no\nsegmentation. Because single-sided detectors do not have the bias applied\non the coupling capacitor, the leakage current was low. No repairs of the\nsingle-sided detectors were needed, since they would remain operational even\nif a capacitor was broken during the wire bonding. Double-sided detectors\nwere \"split biased\" by applying positive bias to the the n-side and negative\nbias to the p-side, corresponding to the axial strips for the ladders. Broken\nAC coupling capacitors caused by flaws in the lithography caused holes in\nthe insulator, called pinholes. If one of the AC coupling capacitors failed for\na channel, leakage current traveled directly through the readout electronics\nconnected to the broken AC capacitor. This caused high leakage current for\nthe detector, even at low bias voltages. Typically, the leakage current was as\nhigh as 100 \u03bcA at a bias voltage of about 10 V applied on the n-side during\ntesting.To remedy this, channels with broken AC coupling capacitors were\nidentified and disconnected from the readout electronics by pulling the wire\nbond between the silicon sensor AC bonding pad and the SVXIIe preamplifier.\nTo identify the broken AC coupling capacitors at one side of the detector, bias\nvoltage was applied on that side and the other side was kept grounded. Typical\nplots of pedestal, noise (defined as pedestal fluctuations for each channel), and\ndifferential noise (defined as fluctuation of the noise difference between two\nconsecutive channels) are shown in Fig. 31 for a chip containing one broken AC\ncapacitor. Broken AC coupling capacitors caused the input of the preamplifier\nto be dominated by the DC component, resulting in an almost constant output\nof the preamplifier. Consequently, the level of noise was low for broken channels\nand high for the neighbors as shown in Fig. 31.This phenomena is further\ndiscussed in Ref. [26]\nThe bonds for broken capacitors were pulled, and after that the positive bias\n60\n\n\fFig. 31. Distributions of pedestal(diamonds), noise (squares), and differential noise\n(triangles) for a chip containing a broken AC capacitor. The noise (sigma \u00d7 10) is\nlow for broken channels and high for neighboring channels. The differential noise is\nplotted multiplied by \u22121 for better visual clarity.\n\nvoltage applied to the n-side could be raised up to VT S + 30 V. VT S is defined\nas the depletion voltage measured on the test structure, and it was determined from the sensor probing discussed in Sec. 5. The leakage currents at\nthe test voltage Vtest , defined as VT S + 20 V, or 90 V, whichever was lower,\nwere measured to be in the range from 5 \u03bcA to 25 \u03bcA.\nA few detectors with high leakage current did not have any broken AC coupling\ncapacitors. It was concluded that the leakage current was due to defects in the\nbulk silicon of the sensors, which could not be repaired.\nThe leakage current at depletion voltage was one of the considerations in the\nfinal electrical grade of the detector. Detectors with very high leakage current\nwere not installed in the SMT.\nOne additional consideration for the detectors from Micron was that the negative bias voltage applied to the p-side was severely limited by micro-discharges\n\u2212\n[16]. For a module with no broken AC coupling capacitors, Vmax\nwas defined\nas the highest voltage that could be applied on the p-side before the current\nstarted to grow exponentially. Above this value the leakage current, and also\n\u2212\nthe noise, increased rapidly. In the absence of micro-discharges, Vmax\nwas set\n1\nto 2 Vtest .\nFor the F-wedges, three additional problems were observed. The sensors had\na tendency to develop pinholes during the first half hour of a burn-in test,\nresulting in high currents. In order to limit the time spent on burn-in, the\nwedges first were biased at the test station at Vtest and left at that voltage\nfor 30 minutes. A second problem which developed for the Micron F-wedges\nwas that there were regions in which pinholes seemingly propagated to several\nadjacent strips. When examining these wedges under a microscope, p-stop implantation faults were seen in the affected areas. However, this correlation was\nnot complete, as some wedges affected did not exhibit visible faults. Probably\n61\n\n\fthis problem was linked to faults in the masking procedure of the silicon. The\nthird problem that affected Micron F-wedge modules was related to the stability of the bias currents. The Eurysis F-wedge sensors generally exhibited\nfewer problems than the Micron sensors. While the Micron sensors in most\ncases had problems on the n-side, the Eurysis sensors exhibited a larger number of pinholes on the p-side. In addition pads that only should be used for\nbonding had been used to probe the sensors, thus the chips were bonded to\npads with probe marks. For these sensors, the I-V characteristics showed a\nclear junction breakdown when applying negative bias.\nOne problem of concern was the general appearance of micro-discharge at\naround 70 V in positive bias, which indicated that the high voltage would be\nlimited to less than the design value for the wedges. This could become an\nissue after type inversion if the depletion voltage needs to be increased past\nthe micro-discharge voltage.\nFor double-sided detectors, 0.8% of the channels were disconnected from the\nreadout electronics during the debugging process. The bare silicon sensors\nwere tested before assembly, and only working channels were bonded. It was\nthus concluded that the capacitors broke during wire bonding.\nThe debugging was the most time consuming step of the production testing\neffort, and therefore its bottleneck.\n\n7.6 Burn-in Tests\n\nThe burn-in test was a long-term functionality test performed during the production testing. First, the burn-in test was done on the bare HDI after its\ninitial functionality test. The second burn-in test was carried out after ladder\nor wedge assembly.\nThe goal of the burn-in test was to run each HDI or detector module for\n72 hours, monitoring its performance and measuring pedestals, total noise,\nrandom noise, gain, and occupancy in sparsification mode. Additional parameters were monitored, including temperature, SVXIIe chip current for the three\nSVXIIe chip voltages, and for ladders and wedges, also detector bias voltage\nand dark current. Typical problems revealed by the burn-in test were SVXIIe\nchip failures, broken and shorted bonds, grounding problems, noisy strips, and\ncoupling capacitor failures. The burn-in setups were able to accommodate 32\ndevices. Two burn-in cycles were run per week, which allowed keeping up with\nthe peak production rate of \u2248 20 detector modules per week. Several different\nsteps were incorporated into the burn-in tests, and they are briefly described\nbelow.\n62\n\n\f7.6.1 Temperature Sensor Test\nThe goal of the temperature sensor test was to check the operation of the\ntemperature sensor mounted on each HDI. The temperature sensor is a thermal resistor, and its voltage is digitized and converted into temperature. The\ntemperature was measured five times with an interval of 20 seconds between\nmeasurements. The test was performed with all readout electronics off and\nwith the sensor at room temperature. The most common failure of the temperature test was due to a bad contact of the thermo-resistor to the HDI.\nThese HDIs were easily repaired.\n7.6.2 Data Integrity Check\nThe goal of the data integrity test was to check the SVXIIe chip downloading.\nThe SVXIIe chips were downloaded about 100 times. For each download cycle,\nthe program compared the initial download file with the one read back from\nthe chip and counted the errors. The parameters that were compared included\nchip ID, channel number and sequence, and pedestal values. Only those HDIs\nthat had no download errors were accepted for future use.\n7.6.3 Long Burn-in Test\nDuring the long burn-in tests, the devices were left powered and biased for 72\nhours. Bare HDIs were run on an aluminum plate that acted as a heat sink,\nand effectively operated at approximately 30\u25e6 C. Higher temperatures could\nprevent the SVXIIe chips from downloading reliably. Modules were run on a\ncooled plate, and operated at about 15 to 20\u25e6 C, depending on the number\nof chips. During the burn-in process, each device was sequentially tested in\nso-called runs. Overall, ten runs were taken. Each individual test took approximately three minutes per chip. i.e. 10 minutes for each 3-chip ladder, 20\nminutes for each 6-chip ladder, etc. Once the last device had been tested for\nthe first time, the system would wait for a user determined delay. During that\ntime the units were left powered and biased, and monitoring information was\ncollected. Several tests were performed during each run. They are summarized\nbelow.\nThe run started by taking one hundred pedestal events in data modes to\nobtain the average pedestal and random noise of the device under test. The\npedestal mean and its width were also recorded for each readout channel\nseparately and average values determined. For every event, the common line\nshift (average pedestal over 128 SVXIIe chip channels) was also calculated.\nThis was used to record common mode subtracted pedestals for every channel,\nfrom which the random noise was determined. This sequence was repeated\nwith the chip in cal inject mode, to obtain pedestal values to be used during\n63\n\n\fthe chip calibration.\nThe next step was the chip calibration. Each channel of the SVXIIe chip was\nconnected to a built-in test input capacitor. The test capacitor was used for\ngain studies, during which a known charge was injected into each channel.\nEvery eighth channel was pulsed simultaneously in order to not to get cross\ntalk from adjacent channels and at the same time have a reasonable run time\nfor the test. Four calibration pulses with different charges were applied one\nafter another to the chip. One hundred events were recorded for each value of\nthe calibration voltage. The same analysis cycle was repeated for eight channel\npatterns so that the charge was injected in every channel of the SVXIIe chip.\nThe chips were also tested in sparsification mode. In this mode, only the channels with a response that exceeds the preset threshold and their immediate\nneighbors were read out and the frequency of false readouts was studied. The\nchip performance in sparsification mode was evaluated by counting the frequency of false readouts for every channel. The readout was called false if the\nchannel appeared in the data more often than expected (noisy channels) or\nless often than expected (dead or low gain channels). For double-sided devices\ncalibration and sparsification readout testing were performed separately for\nthe p- and n-side.\nMonitoring information was collected once per minute for the duration of the\nburn-in test. Bias voltage and current were measured for ladders and wedges\ndirectly through the high voltage power supply.\nThe burn-in test proved to be an efficient and reliable tool to test the long\nterm reliability of the detector modules before installation into the SMT. Bare\nHDIs were selected for detector construction based on the results of the burnin test. Together with the laser test, the burn-in test was used to characterize\nthe detector modules and select those devices to be installed in the tracker.\nOver a thousand HDIs and detector modules were tested during the SMT\nproduction testing project. Taking into account the average load of 75%, this\ncorresponds to approximately 6,000 hours of stable running by each of the two\nburn-in stations.\n7.7 Laser Test\nThe laser test was performed on every detector module that passed the burnin test. The modules were characterized by measuring the depletion voltage\nand by determining the numbers of dead and noisy channels. This information had already been obtained by other tests: the burn-in was able to identify\ndead and noisy channels, and the probe tests on the sensors determined their\ndepletion voltage. However, early tests indicated discrepancies between the\n64\n\n\fdepletion voltage measured during sensor probing and the one obtained on\nthe assembled module. This led to the implementation of the laser test, and\nalthough it provided redundant information, it was considered a useful tool\nin the characterization of modules. This was particularly true in the characterization of irradiated detectors, to study noisy strips, and to investigate\nirregular charge collection observed on some ladders. The test stand was set\nup to run completely automatically and was very fast.\nA simplified diagram of the laser test stand is shown in Fig. 32. It was based\non the one-SASeq test stand, with the addition of an infrared laser and a\nmovable table. The solid state laser had a wavelength of 1064 nm. Given the\nattenuation length of the silicon of 206 \u03bcm, the laser penetrated the entire\ndepth of the 300 \u03bcm thick detector and not just a surface layer. The laser was\nconnected to an optical fiber. At the end of the fiber, a focusing lens collimated\nthe laser spot. Completed modules were placed on an x-y movable table and\nshuttled underneath the laser head. Two laser test stands were used during\nproduction.\nfiber\n\nREADY>\n\nLASER\n\nxy step\nmotor\n\nlense\nKSU\ninterface\nboard\n\nflat cable\n\ndetector\n\nGC\n\nVME\ncrate\nSASeq\n\nmovable table\n\nAVDD\n\nDVDD\n\nAVDD2\n\nHV supply\n\nFig. 32. Simplified scheme of the laser test stand setup.\n\nThe depletion voltage was measured by monitoring the charge collected on the\nreadout strips that detected the laser, as a function of the bias voltage. The\nprocedure for the single-sided detectors was the following: first, the range of the\nvoltage variation was set from 0 V to Vtest . Then, the bias voltage was increased\nautomatically in steps of 5 V, and after each step the amplitude of the laser\nsignal in ADC counts was measured. The leakage current of the detector at\neach voltage setting was also recorded. We found an almost linear increase of\nthe amplitude A of the signal with the bias voltage V up to a value Vmin , after\nwhich the A(V ) curve reaches a plateau. As a first approximation, the A(V )\ncurve can be described by a slope and a plateau that fit the data linearly. The\n65\n\n\fdepletion voltage was defined as the voltage corresponding to the point where\nthe two linear fits intersect. The results using this method for determining the\ndepletion voltage Vdepl was in most cases in good agreement with the results\nobtained with the C\u2013V method of the depletion voltage measurements used\non silicon sensors. The minimal operating voltage was defined as the voltage\nat the beginning of the plateau. The operating voltage Voper of the detector\nwas obtained by adding 5 V to the minimal operating voltage. The procedure\nwas very similar for double-sided detectors.\nThe 3-chip ladders, the 9-chip ladders, and the H-wedges which consist of two\nsilicon sensors had their strips wire-bonded by pairs to each other. For these\ndevices, the depletion voltage was measured separately for the two sensors.\nBecause sensors were paired into detectors based on their depletion voltage\nas determined during sensor probing, these two measurements were in general\nvery close. The higher of the two operating voltages was taken as the detector\noperating voltage.\nThe laser scan was also used to identify dead and noisy channels. This was\nperformed with the detectors biased at Voper , as determined from the laser test.\nEvery channel was read out ten times resulting in a set of raw amplitudes.\nThe average amplitude and the standard deviation were calculated over the\nten measurements.\nEach detector module was tested with the laser at least once during the production testing effort. The information obtained was used as input for the\ngrading of the modules.\n7.8 Diagnosis and Repair of Defective Modules\nHDI and detector modules with download or readout problems had to be\ndiagnosed and repaired. A total of 339 problematic HDIs and detectors were\nfound, and most of them were also repaired. Although some of the repairs were\nperformed by the physicists working on diagnosing the problems, most of the\nrepairs required work done by a specially trained technician. Malfunction of\nHDIs was usually due to problems during stuffing at the commercial vendors,\nor bad packaging before shipping. Detectors were also damaged during the\nproduction and testing process, or during installation on the rings or on the\nbarrels.\nThe stations used for the diagnosis and repair effort were based on the oneSASeq test stations with the addition of a microscope, a probe, an oscilloscope,\nand a logic analyzer. This additional equipment made it possible to probe\nthe signals on the SVXIIe chips directly. One very important feature of the\ndiagnosis stations was that on the IC, the top neighbor and bottom neighbor\n66\n\n\flines were disconnected, and the signal was sent to the SVXIIe chips via the\nprobe. This made it possible to download the chips one by one, which turned\nout to be a very effective tool to find bad chips on a device that was showing\ndownload errors.\nThe procedure to diagnose modules with problems was the following:\n(1) Visual inspection to look for broken or shorted bonds. On HDIs that failed\nto work properly at the initial functionality test, the visual inspection was\nextended to check that all capacitors and resistors were mounted properly.\n(2) Check the HDI tail for shorts between the three voltage power lines and\nground. Shorts tend to develop at the trimmed end of the tail of the HDI\nand could be fixed by sanding the tail with sandpaper.\n(3) Shorts would also develop due to solder on the tail or under a surface\nmounted component making contact with other pads. Several H-wedge\nHDIs developed shorts between one trace and ground due to sparks from\na capacitor between the bias voltage line and ground to this trace.\n(4) Broken traces on the HDI could in most cases be repaired by adding an\nextra wire. This kind of problem was very common on the H-wedges, for\nwhich traces often broke close to the Hirose connector that was mounted\non the HDI tail.\n(5) Shorts on the SVXIIe chips themselves were identified by first isolating\nthe faulty chip by pulling the relevant bonds, and then measuring the\nresistance between the shorted channel and ground. If a short was found\non a chip, the chip was replaced.\n(6) If no short was found between the power lines and ground, the next step\nwas to try to download the chips. Usually at least one of the chips would\ngive download errors. To identify the problem, the lines were checked\nwith the logic analyzer.\n(7) To further investigate which chip had download errors, chips were downloaded individually. Chips were isolated by pulling the top neighbor and\nthe bottom neighbor bonds. When the chip with the download errors\nwas identified, it was checked once more for bad bonds and if none were\nfound, the chip was replaced.\n(8) If a chip was downloading correctly but had a readout problem such as\nno gain, it was replaced.\n(9) Occasionally, detectors would stop working after encapsulation of the\nwire bonds. In those circumstances, the encapsulant was removed, which\ncaused the wire-bonds to come off too, and the detector re-bonded.\n(10) On some of the detectors, neighboring chips were damaged during replacing of a bad chip. This was especially common for the F-wedges.\nOf the 339 devices (181 bare HDIs and 158 detectors) that were diagnosed\nby the repair group, 264 were fully recovered. From these, 74 had only minor\nproblems, such as bad grounding or missing or damaged bonds. Thirty-eight\n67\n\n\fdetectors could not be repaired, and for 37, the repair was not attempted,\nbecause enough spares of the same type were available. A total of 288 SVXIIe\nchips was replaced: 145 because of readout problems, 83 did not download,\nand 60 had a short. A total of 14 components was found missing on the HDIs.\nProblems with the tail or the traces on the HDIs occurred for 51 devices.\nThe types of devices with the most problems were F-wedges and 9-chip ladders:\n113 and 114, respectively. Seventy-eight H-wedges, 32 6-chip ladders, and seven\n3-chip ladders were sent to the repair group. F-wedges often took a long time\nto repair since they were frequently damaged during repair. H-wedges were\ndifficult to diagnose since they often had many broken traces close to the\nconnector on the tail.\nThe effort of the repair group was essential to completing of the SMT because\nthere were not enough spares to replace broken detector modules or nonfunctioning HDIs.\n\n7.9 Electrical Grading and Characteristics of Detector Modules\n\nThe results collected during detector burn-in and laser test were used to assign an electrical grade to each detector module. We defined two types of\n\"exceptional\" channels:\n\u2022 A channel was called DEAD if its response to the laser in the laser test was\nless than 40 counts (the average response was 100 counts). For detectors with\ntwo sensors, the one with the larger count of dead channels was considered\nin the electrical grading.\n\u2022 A channel was called NOISY if its random noise in data mode during\nburn-in was larger than 6 counts (average noise was 1.5 counts)\nA detector was assigned an \"A\" grade if the sum of the number of dead\nand noisy channels was less than 2.6% of the total number of channels. This\ncorresponds to 10 channels for a 3-chip ladder, 20 channels for a 6-chip ladder,\netc. No distinction between n-side and p-side bad channels was made in the\ngrading. A detector was assigned a \"B\" grade if the sum of the number of dead\nand noisy channels was more than 2.6% but less than 5.2%. Detectors with\nmore than 5.2% bad channels were graded as \"C.\" In addition, we required\nthat the leakage current be less than 10 \u03bcA at operating voltage and that\nthe burn-in results were stable over time. Mostly \"A\" grade detectors were\ninstalled in the SMT, no \"C\" grade detectors were installed.\nThe performance of detector modules installed in barrels and F-disks is summarized in Table 10 and Table 11, respectively.\n68\n\n\fTable 10\nFractions of dead and noisy channels in barrel detectors given in percent.\nBarrel\n\nLayer 1\n\nLayer 2\n\nLayer 3\n\nLayer 4\n\nDead\n\nNoisy\n\nDead\n\nNoisy\n\nDead\n\nNoisy\n\nDead\n\nNoisy\n\n1\n\n0.85\n\n0.4\n\n1.99\n\n0.8\n\n0.93\n\n0.4\n\n1.77\n\n0.6\n\n2\n\n0.95\n\n0.56\n\n2.13\n\n0.43\n\n1.34\n\n0.22\n\n2.01\n\n0.44\n\n3\n\n0.70\n\n0.30\n\n1.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.77\n\n0.12\n\n1.27\n\n0.3\n\n4\n\n0.56\n\n0.18\n\n2.1\n\n0.5\n\n0.84\n\n0.06\n\n1.50\n\n0.2\n\n5\n\n0.77\n\n0.51\n\n1.65\n\n0.27\n\n1.22\n\n0.32\n\n1.54\n\n0.2\n\n6\n\n1.1\n\n0.07\n\n2.7\n\n0.4\n\n1.48\n\n0.12\n\n1.85\n\n0.16\n\nTable 11\nFractions of dead and noisy channels in F-disks given in percent.\nDisk\n\nDead\n\nNoisy\n\n1\n\n0.92\n\n0.23\n\n2\n\n1.0\n\n0.21\n\n3\n\n1.75\n\n0.05\n\n4\n\n1.0\n\n0.32\n\n5\n\n1.65\n\n0.05\n\n6\n\n1.02\n\n0.25\n\n7\n\n1.25\n\n0.33\n\n8\n\n1.4\n\n0.13\n\n9\n\n1.22\n\n0.45\n\n10\n\n1.32\n\n0.15\n\n11\n\n1.15\n\n0.45\n\n12\n\n1.25\n\n0.35\n\nIt can be seen that the characteristics of the devices are very similar throughout the different barrels and disks, resulting in a uniform acceptance of hits\nproduced by charged particles.\n\n69\n\n\f8\n\nAssembly of the Central Detector\n\nThe central detector assembly was built in two cylinders. Each cylinder contains four sub-assemblies, three barrel-disk modules, and one end-disk module.\nThis section begins with descriptions of the assembly of the barrels and the\nF-disks. Following these is a description of the mating procedure used to assemble these elements into the two module types, barrel-disk and end-disk.\nThe final subsection covers the installation and alignment of these modules in\nthe support cylinders.\n\n8.1 The Barrel Assembly\n\nThe primary mounting of the ladders was to the cooled (active) bulkhead,\nwith a secondary mounting point at a thin membrane (passive bulkhead).\nThe cooled bulkhead is the primary mechanical object, supporting the F-disks\nmated to the barrel and providing the connections to the support cylinder. The\nladders themselves form the mechanical connection between the two bulkheads\nso that the passive bulkhead serves as a precise spacer at the cantilevered ends\nof the ladders.\nThe barrel detectors are used in the Level 2 track trigger [6], which utilizes\nmainly the r \u2212 \u03c6 information to look for tracks with large impact parameter.\nThe polar angles of the tracks are not available to the trigger. Precise placement of the sensors is therefore essential to maintain the trigger hit resolution.\nThe constraints on assembly accuracy are discussed in the next section.\nThe beryllium plates in the ladders were used to locate the ladders on precisely\nmachined beryllium bulkheads. The original intent was to have no adjustment\nin this mounting, but machining precision and ladder assembly precision were\nnot sufficient, so that some alignment was done during ladder installation, as\ndescribed below.\nThe survey data recorded as part of the quality assurance during assembly,\ndescribed in detail below, provided a very good starting point for off-line\nalignment with tracks.\n\n8.1.1 Requirements on Assembly and Survey Accuracy\nDeviations from the ladder nominal position can be characterized by three\nshifts and three rotations. If the deviations are small, rotations effectively\ncommute so all six parameters were considered independently.\n70\n\n\fFig. 33. Ladder and its local coordinate system. Axial strips run along the ladder\n(y-axis).\n\nShifts \u2206x and \u2206y , with the local coordinate system given in Fig. 33, result in\nmis-measurements that are uniform across the ladder and equal to the shifts.\nA shift \u2206z and all rotations result in mis-measurements which are functions\nof the position within the ladder.\nThe rotations in the xy and yz planes introduce mis-measurements which depend on y and therefore can not be corrected at the trigger level. These two\nrotations dictated the assembly precision required. The dominant impact parameter uncertainty at the trigger level is the beam size (about 30 \u03bcm), and\nalignment errors should not compromise it. Detailed simulations were performed to see how alignment errors in individual layers propagate to the error\non the impact parameter. The misalignment of the geometry was simulated\none layer at a time, with the limit of the impact parameter error to be less\nthan half the beam spot size. Each layer was allowed to contribute equally to\nthe impact parameter error. This led to allowed limits for the misalignment\nof 10, 15, 20 and 15 \u03bcm for layers 1 through 4. Since the simulation assumed\n100% hit efficiency, we conservatively took 10 \u03bcm to be the limit on alignment\nerrors in each layer which translates into\n\u2206xy = 25 \u03bcm\n\u2206yz = 160 \u03bcm for layers 1 and 2\n\u2206yz = 320 \u03bcm for layers 3 and 4,\nwhere \u2206xy /\u2206yz is the rotation in the xy/yz plane corresponding to the movement of the edge of the ladder. In the calculations done in order to reach\nthese numbers, perfectly planar ladders were assumed. Two deviations from\nplanarity were further considered: \"tent\"-like shape [Fig. 34(a)] and a twist\n71\n\n\f[Fig. 34(b)].\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFig. 34. Ladder deviations from plan: (a) \"Tent\"-like deviations and (b) twist.\n\nThe former contributes to the trigger resolution in the same way as \u2206yz . The\neffect of twisting is more than a factor of three smaller than that from \u2206xz .\nOffline, however, these shapes are considerably more difficult to incorporate\ninto software corrections and in situ alignment algorithms using tracks. This\nmeans that these effects may also impact not only the trigger resolution, but\nalso the final offline tracking resolution. Therefore these contributions were\nkept to a minimum during detector assembly.\n\n8.2 Measurements of Ladders\n\nThe main purpose of the ladder survey was to provide a link between the\noptical targets printed on the silicon sensors and the mechanical elements of\nthe ladder structure. These elements could be surveyed with a touch probe\nafter the ladders were installed in the barrels and the optical targets were no\nlonger accessible. An important byproduct of these measurements was quality\ncontrol of ladder planarity. These measurements were all done on an optical\nCMM with automated pattern recognition and auto-focus capabilities. The\nmachine accuracy was less than 2 \u03bcm in the xy plane and less than 5 \u03bcm in z\nwhen measuring distinctive features such as the metalization on the sensors.\n72\n\n\fFigure 35 shows the measurement points taken on 9-chip ladders. Measurements of 3- and 6-chip ladders were similar.First, six silicon fiducial markers,\nnoted by + and a number in the figure, were measured. They were fit to a\nplane, which was defined to be the xy plane of the measurement. The origin of\nthe coordinate system coincides with fiducial 1 with the y axis passing through\nfiducial 2. Ladder flatness was defined as the minimum separation between two\nplanes parallel to the xy plane which would contain all six measured points. It\nwas defined to be positive if the ends of the ladder were below the xy plane (as\nin Fig. 34a) and negative otherwise. Figure 36 shows the flatness distribution\nfor ladders installed in the inner two layers of the detector.\n\nB\nA\n\nC\nx\n\nx\n\n3+ +4\n\n2+\n\n+1\n\n5+ +6\n\nF\n\nx\n\nx\n\nE\n\nD\n\nFig. 35. Ladder measurements. Lighter gray rectangles are silicon crystals, darker\ngray are beryllium support. Silicon fiducials are noted by + with a number; measurement on a beryllium surface by x; measurement of beryllium edges with arrows\nand letters.\n\nAfter the coordinate system was established, the beryllium surfaces (noted by\nx) and edges (noted by arrows with letters) were measured (see Fig. 35). The\nedges of the beryllium supports were not perfectly machined and generally\nwere not square (see Fig. 37). It was therefore necessary to make a scan across\nthe edge. With the optical probe, three measurements were taken at the three\ndifferent focus points indicated in Fig. 37. The average of the three was taken\nas the final measurement. For touch probe measurements, a scan with a 50 \u03bcm\nstep was made, with a probe diameter of 1 mm, and the largest measurement\nwas used.\nThe edges of the beryllium can have microscopic bumps with a typical size\nof 20\u201330 \u03bcm. Figure 38 schematically shows the effect such bumps can have\non the measurements. Defects like this were not frequent, but as a precaution\nthree scans were performed at each location, separated by 100 \u03bcm.\n73\n\n\fNumber of Ladders\n\n20\n\nMean\nRMS\n\n(a)\n\n0.1250E-01\n0.3741E-01\n\n15\n10\n5\n0\n-0.2 -0.15 -0.1 -0.05\n\n0\n\n0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2\n\nNumber of Ladders\n\nFlatness [mm]\n\n15\n\nMean\nRMS\n\n(b)\n\n0.5556E-02\n0.4180E-01\n\n10\n5\n0\n-0.2 -0.15 -0.1 -0.05\n\n0\n\n0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2\nFlatness [mm]\n\nFig. 36. Ladder flatness for ladders in (a) layer 1 and (b) layer 2.\n\nSince the systematic errors associated with the optical and touch probe methods were different, the comparison of these measurements provided a very\npowerful consistency check. Figure 39 shows the difference between the ladder\nwidths determined by the touch probe and optical methods. The absence of a\nhigh tail in the distribution confirms that edge imperfections are not frequent.\nThe distribution is centered at \u221217 \u03bcm, i.e. on average the touch probe gave\nsmaller widths. This effect was studied in great detail and was attributed to\nthe edge finding algorithm, as well as the bias introduced by choosing the\naverage of the optical measurements at three focal depths versus the largest\nof the touch probe measurements taken through the thickness. However, this\nsystematic bias does not contribute to the accuracy of the ladder position\nwhich was determined by pairs of measurements taken on opposite surfaces.\nThus the ladder position accuracy was completely determined by the intrinsic\naccuracy of the CMM machine, about 6 \u03bcm, which was sufficient for quality\ncontrol.\n\n8.3 Assembly and Survey Procedures\nThe assembly process started with aligning active and passive bulkheads. Both\nwere mounted on a rotating barrel support fixture. The cooled bulkhead was\nfixed in place and served as the primary reference system for measurements.\n74\n\n\fTouch Probe\n\nOptical\nsurface point\n\nthree focal depths\nscan with 50 micron step\nedge measurement\n\nFig. 37.

The optical measurement may not be affected by the bump, while\nthe touch probe was.\n\nThe face of this bulkhead and precision holes at 3 and 9 o'clock were used\nto establish the reference coordinate system. Precision spacers were used to\nlocate the passive bulkhead parallel to the cooled bulkhead and to match\nmachined alignment holes at 3 and 9 o'clock. The passive bulkhead position\nwas adjusted until it was within 10 \u03bcm of nominal and clamped to the fixture.\n75\n\n\fFig. 39. Difference in ladder width as determined by touch probe and optical\nmethods. Negative values mean that touch probe consistently gave smaller widths.\n\nNext, the ladders were installed using an adjustable mounting fixture. The\nassembly sequence was determined by convenience of HDI pigtail routing. It\nwas found that it was easiest to assemble the barrels from the inside out. All\nbarrels except the first one were assembled this way. The surface where the\nladders mate to the cooled bulkheads had thermal grease applied to enhance\nthe heat transfer through these joints, with the exception of the layer 4 ladders\nwhich were glued in place using silver epoxy. These ladders then provided the\nrigid coupling between the cooled and passive bulkheads once the barrel was\nremoved from the assembly fixture.\nAfter installation of each ladder, an electrical test was performed to ensure\nthat it was not damaged. The ladder was powered, nominal bias voltage was\napplied, and pedestal values were recorded. Bias current and low voltage currents were checked. The most common damage was to wire bonds either from\ncontact with HDI tails from other ladders or during ladder position adjustment. In layer 4, the silver epoxy, which should hold the ladders in place,\nmigrated in some cases and produced shorts along the exposed edges of the\nsensors. Damaged ladders were removed for repair and the assembly continued\nwith other ladders.\nAfter electrical testing, the ladder was surveyed with the touch probe. The\ntouch probe measurements were then fit to the optical measurements taken\npreviously. If the measured \u2206xy was more than 25 \u03bcm, the ladder was adjusted\nand resurveyed. Since it was not possible to control the adjustment, sometimes\n76\n\n\fNumber of Ladders\n\nConstant\n62.52\nMean -0.5678E-03\nSigma 0.1254E-01\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n-0.1\n\n-0.05\n\n0\n\n0.05\n\n0.1\n\nDelta xy [mm]\n\nFig. 40. Barrel survey summary: \u2206xy . The width of the distribution is well below\nthe required 25 \u03bcm.\n\nseveral iterations had to be performed. In rare cases, it was impossible to reach\nthe desired \u2206xy due to ladder or bulkhead imperfections.\nWhen the whole barrel was assembled, dabs of silver epoxy were added to\nthe ladders in layers one, two, and three to ensure electrical contact between\nthe beryllium bulkheads and the ground of the HDI electronics. This also improved the mechanical stability of the barrels. All ladders were again checked\nelectrically, and the final survey of the ladders was performed. Prior to the\nfinal survey, the HDI tails were permanently strain-relieved to a carbon fiber\nhoop mounted around the outer perimeter of the cooled beryllium bulkhead.\nThe full barrel survey was a 2\u20133 day process for each of the six barrels. The\ndistributions of \u2206xy and \u2206yz for all ladders in all barrels are shown in Fig. 40\nand Fig. 41, respectively.\nAfter all modules were surveyed, we performed the best fit to find a global\ncoordinate system for the barrel, i.e. the system where the ladder rotations\nwere minimal. This was done for all six barrels, and it was found that the\nbest system was very close to the assembly system. After assembly, testing,\nand final survey of a barrel was complete, the barrel was removed from the\nassembly fixture and stored in a clean, dry air environment until it was mated\nwith its F-disk.\n77\n\n\fNumber of Ladders\n\n20\n\nConstant\n16.09\nMean\n0.7914E-02\nSigma 0.6661E-01\n\n(a)\n\n15\n10\n5\n0\n-0.4 -0.3 -0.2 -0.1\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\nNumber of Ladders\n\nDelta yz [mm]\n\n40\n\nConstant\n30.90\nMean\n0.7813E-02\nSigma 0.6391E-01\n\n(b)\n\n30\n20\n10\n0\n-0.4 -0.3 -0.2 -0.1\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\nDelta yz [mm]\n\nFig. 41.

The width of the distribution is well below\nthe required 160 \u03bcm for layers 1 and 2 (a) and 320 \u03bcm for layers 3 and 4 (b).\n\n8.4 The F-disk Assembly\n\nThis subsection describes the assembly, survey, and quality control testing of\nthe F-disks. Figure 42 shows a photograph of an F-disk assembly.\nThe F-disks were mounted to the barrels via carbon fiber posts with precision\nmachined aluminum inserts which engaged holes in the barrels and attached\nwith aluminum nuts on titanium studs. In the case of the end-disk modules,\nposts from two disks were mated with ruby balls and glued together.\n\n8.4.1 Beryllium Support Rings\nThe beryllium support rings provide the infrastructure for the F-disks, including the mechanical mounts as well as the cooling. The rings were made from\ntwo pieces of beryllium laminated together. The beryllium ring was assembled\nwith mounting and aligning hardware as well as plumbing connections.\nThe beryllium was machined by Phoenix Precision [27]. The most important\nconsideration for this process was the flatness of the finished piece. Figure 43\nshows the distribution of flatness for each of the two beryllium halves of the\nassembly. They range in flatness from 25\u201350 \u03bcm. The beryllium pieces contain\n78\n\n\fFig. 42. First prototype F-disk assembly.\n\nalignment holes to determine the positions of the disks as well as the wedges.\nAfter the two sides were laminated together, they were resurveyed for flatness\nand precision of the locating features on the two sides.\n\nFig. 43. Flatness distributions of beryllium ring halves used in F-disks.\n\nThe rest of the assembly was performed on a base plate with a center pin as a\nprimary reference. Threaded studs, on which the wedges would be mounted,\nwere inserted and then surveyed with respect to the alignment holes on the\nring. The posts that position the disk on either the barrels or within the endring assembly were then mounted and inspected. Sapphire alignment balls,\nmeasuring 3 mm in diameter, were mounted on arms made from scrap beryl79\n\n\flium and attached to the cooling ring. The balls were located in the space\nbetween two adjacent wedges near the 2, 4, 8, 10, and 12 o'clock positions,\n12.5 mm radially outward from the cooling ring. After complete assembly, the\nrings were leak checked and surveyed for mechanical precision.\n8.4.2 Installation of Wedges on Rings\nBefore the wedges were mounted on rings, the bias bonds on the corners of\nthe sensor were encapsulated for protection. This encapsulation was done by\nhand, using a syringe to apply the encapsulant. The encapsulant was heat\ncured for an hour.\nDuring the assembly of the first F-disk, the procedure was to also encapsulate\nall other bonds on the sensor. Each qualified wedge was retested immediately\nbefore placement on the ring. Leakage current tests indicated that there was\nsome problem with the interaction of the encapsulant with the double-sided\ndetector so this step was eliminated during assembly of the remaining disks.\nThe wedges were mounted on the rings using the same fixtures as for the ring\nassembly. This assembly was mounted on a CMM for precise alignment of the\nwedges. Each wedge has four mounting holes in the beryllium substructure\nwhich supports the HDI. These four holes engage studs mounted on the ring.\nThe design clearance between the studs on the rings and the holes in the\nberyllium mounting plates of the wedges was 100 \u03bcm, allowing for adjustment\nof the wedge positions. The wedges had thermal grease applied to the cover\nlayer over the jumper on the HDI where the mechanical contact occurs with\nthe ring and good thermal contact needs to be ensured. The grease improves\nthe heat flow through this joint by a factor of two. All six odd numbered\nwedges were installed on a ring and then the six were aligned relative to the\nring mounting holes and center pin of the fixture. Figure 44 shows a partially\npopulated ring assembly on the CMM.\nEach wedge was aligned using the same two sensor fiducial marks used for\ngluing the sensor to the HDI. To move the wedge for alignment, two nuts were\nloosened, and the wedge was carefully pried to change position. This process\nwas repeated until the fiducial positions matched the predetermined positions\nin x and y to within 10 \u03bcm. Once a wedge was positioned correctly, the nuts\nwere tightened to hold it in place. This process was very difficult, and about\n7% of the wedges were damaged and had to be replaced. After alignment, a\nfinal survey was done to record the wedge locations and survey ball locations\nrelative to the ring reference holes.\nOnce the first six wedges were aligned on the ring, it was tested electrically to\nmake sure no bonds had been damaged and that the wedges were still working\ncorrectly. The disk was carefully flipped over to mount the even numbered\n80\n\n\fFig. 44. Photograph of the beryllium F-ring with 3 wedges mounted on it.\n\nwedges. The same mounting and alignment procedure was followed for the\neven numbered wedges. After all wedges were mounted and aligned on the\nring, the disk was again electrically tested to ensure proper function.\nWorking disks were dismounted from the CMM disk assembly fixture and\nplaced in individual boxes. These boxes were made from static free Plexiglas and included grounding straps for extra static protection. The disks were\nstored in a dry box until they were ready for mating with a barrel or with\nanother end-disk. For the disks mated with barrels, a dimpled 0.025 mm polyimide foil was carefully mounted over the posts to try to minimize heat transfer\nfrom the disks to the barrel detectors mounted close by. The HDI tails were\ncarefully dressed into a pinwheel design to hold them during mating.\n\n8.5 Mating of Barrels to Disks and End-disk Assemblies\nThe final assembly step consisted of mating F-disks either to barrels or to one\nanother to form the end-disk assemblies, followed by final dressing of cables\nand cooling tubes.\nThe mating of barrels to disks utilized a fixture consisting of a rotating Plexiglas disk from which the F-disk was suspended and a lifting table on which the\nbarrel was located. The lifting table was initially used to transfer the F-disk\nfrom its storage box onto the hangers which suspended it from the Plexiglas\ndisk. Additional locating stops limited the movement of the F-disk relative\nto the Plexiglas disk. The Plexiglas disk was then rotated to achieve the ap81\n\n\fpropriate orientation relative to the barrel, and the barrel lifted into place\nunder the F-disk until the posts extending from the F-disk ring engaged the\nmounting holes in the barrel bulkhead. The relatively unconstrained state of\nthe F-disk allowed it settle into place without stress and provided visual feedback when it was not seating correctly. The barrel was raised until the F-disk\nassembly was lifted off the hangers before nuts were installed to secure the\ndisk to the barrel. Finally, the F-disk HDI tails were dressed to the carbon\nfiber cable strain relief ring on the barrel and the assembly stored in a clean,\ndry environment until installation in the support cylinders.\nThe end-disk assemblies consist of sets of three F-disks mounted to one another. Because the spacing of these disks is not tight, it was possible to\nput these assemblies together without special tooling. The central disks have\nmounting posts on both sides with 5 mm ruby balls at the ends, while the\ninner and outer disks have posts only on the side facing the center disk with\nconical receptacles which accept the 5 mm ruby balls. The central disk was\nleft mounted in its storage box while the inner disk was manually installed\non it. Structural epoxy was used on the ruby balls to permanently bond the\nrings together. Spring clips were used at each post-ball-post interface to ensure proper seating of the balls while the epoxy cured. The assembly was then\nflipped over and the outer disk added in a similar fashion. Cables and cooling\ntubes were dressed and the assembly stored in a clean, dry environment until\ninstallation in the support cylinders.\n\n82\n\n\f9\n\nInstallation of the Detector\n\nThe SMT detector was built at the Fermilab Silicon Detector Facility and then\ntransported about 3 km to the D0 collision hall. The installation of the barrels\nand F-disks within the bore of the CFT, shown in Fig. 45, was completed in\nDecember 2000. The final H-disk was installed in early February 2001, and\nabout 20% of the electronics were in place for the beginning of Run II in\nMarch.\nDetailed descriptions of the transportation and installation of the barrel detector are given in the following section.\n\n9.1 Transportation and Installation of the Barrel Detector\nThe assembled detector halves were mounted inside transportation boxes for\nthe drive to D0, as well as the trip from the loading bay to the center of the\nD0 detector.\nThe cushioned box incorporated several features for various portions of the\ntransportation and installation journey. The main components of the box were\na base plate with a rail system mounted on it, a 4-sided enclosure (cover), a\ncable tray assembly mounted under the base-plate, and a set of rollers to allow\nthe box to be slid along a trolley system in the collision hall. In addition, a\ncart with air suspension was used during the trip from the assembly lab to the\nloading dock at the experimental hall to reduce accelerations to less than 5g.\n\nFig. 45. Installation of the silicon detector in the CFT.\n\n83\n\n\fFig. 46. Installation of the silicon detector on the transportation rail.\n\nThe first stage of the installation journey involved transferring the completed\ndetector assemblies from the rotating fixtures used for barrel and disk installation and cabling onto the rail system mounted to the base plate of the\ntransportation box. This was done using the slide and ball screw mechanism\nwhich was used to install the barrel and disk assemblies into the support cylinder. Straps were run around the cylinder and the cylinder was slowly lifted and\nreleased from the rotating support frame, which was then removed from under\nthe cylinder. The transport box base, with cable tray, was then slid under the\ncylinder and the cylinder lowered onto the rails (Fig. 46). The cylinder has\n\"feet\" at the z=0 end at \u00b145\u25e6 which are the final supports from the CFT inner\nbarrel. At the outer end, temporary feet were screwed to the outer membrane\nof the support cylinder. Once lowered onto the rails, small clamps were used\nlocally at each foot to secure the cylinder to the rail system. The rail system\nwas coupled to the base plate of the box through rubber mounts to provide\nsome isolation from impact loading during movement, as well as to allow for\nsmall alignment corrections when these rails were mated to the pre-existing\nrail system inside the fiber tracker.\nThe 4-sided cover was installed next. This provided mechanical protection for\nthe assembly as well as a semi-sealed volume for purge gas. The outer end of\nthe box was left open where the cables exited. The cables were then dressed\ninto the cable tray assembly under the box, then the box assembly was sealed\nfrom the bottom of the cable tray assembly to the box cover to provide a sealed\npurge gas volume. A nitrogen purge was provided during the drive. This was\nimportant as the detector was moved during the winter and condensation\nonto the detector was possible after arrival at the collision hall. Finally, a set\nof brackets was installed which coupled to the base plate, ran outside the box\n84\n\n\fcover, and terminated above the center of gravity of the assembly with rollers\nfor the trolley system used in the collision hall.\nThe completed package was loaded onto an air-ride cart designed to limit\nimpact loading to less than 5g during the truck ride to the collision hall.\nSeveral test runs were made using a dead weight on the cart to simulate the\nsilicon load. Accelerometers attached to fixed points on the cart routinely\nregistered loads in excess of 5g and occasionally above 10g when the truck hit\nsmall bumps in the road. However, the mock silicon assembly was insulated\nsuch that loads were always below the 5g threshold. During the transportation\nof the two detector halves, accelerometers were placed on the silicon enclosure\nto monitor the device in all three directions; none of the 5g sensors tripped\nduring transportation.\nUpon arrival at the collision hall, the detector halves were lifted by crane\ndirectly from the rear of the truck to the trolley system. A length of pipe was\nslid through the trolley system rollers on the transportation box and stops\nwere installed to prevent the box from moving along the pipe. The pipe was\nthen picked up by the crane and the assembly lifted from the air ride cart and\n\"flown\" to the detector area. The trolley pipe traveling with the silicon was\njoined to the fixed section running from the outside of the detector into the\ncalorimeter gap. The detector was then rolled along the trolley system into\nthe area just outside the calorimeters. At this point, the cables were unpacked\nand hung from additional carts on the trolley system. The box cover was\nalso removed at this point. The silicon was moved along the remainder of the\ntrolley path into the calorimeter gap where the assembly was lowered onto a\ntable mounted onto the calorimeter.\nAt this stage, the silicon was still sitting on the rails mounted to the transportation box base plate. The base plate was slid by hand until the rails\nengaged the ends of the rail system inside the inner barrel of the fiber tracker.\nThe final step was to slide the detector along the rails into its final position,\nat which point the outer end of the detector was secured in place with a set\nof nuts engaged on titanium studs at the end of the fiber tracker.\nAfter removal of the installation equipment, final connections were made to\nthe cooling system and cables. After connection of each cable, a functionality\ntest was performed to ensure a good connection.\nThe cabling of the more than 15000 connections and the installation of all electronics were completely finished in May 2001. Problems during the commissioning mainly concerned power supplies and the distribution of the operating\nand high voltages.\n\n85\n\n\f10\n\nPerformance and Lifetime\n\nAfter its installation 2001, the SMT has been successfully operating for more\nthan eight years. The detector is performing very well, providing good tracking\nand vertexing for the D0 experiment.\nThe signal-to-noise ratio was measured to be between 10 and 15 depending on\nthe module type. The signal is defined as the cluster charge given by a minimum ionizing particle including a correction for the incident angle, and the\nnoise as the rms of the pedestal distributions. The noise consists of intrinsic,\nrandom noise coming from the front-end of the SVXIIe chip, and environmental, coherent noise. The signal-to-noise ratio calculated only from random\nnoise is between 12 and 18. Gains vary among detector types with the n-sides\n5\u201315% lower than the p-sides due to the larger load capacitance. Pulse height\ninformation from the SVXIIe is used to calculate cluster centroids and can also\nbe used for dE/dx tagging of low momentum tracks. Figure 47 shows dE/dx\ndistributions after corrections for gain and incident angle are made.\n\nFig. 47. Distribution of energy loss for a kaon-enriched sample of tracks showing\n\u03c0, K, and proton bands.\n\nFigure 48 shows the impact parameter distribution for tracks with respect to\nthe primary vertex. Only charged particles with transverse momentum larger\nthan 3 GeV/c are included in the plot. The only a lignment in this case is\nthe geometrical alignment described in Sec. 8. The Gaussian fit has a width\n86\n\n\fNumber of Tracks\n\nof 60 \u03bcm to which the beam size contributes 30 to 40 \u03bcm. After an alignment\nprocedure where both the hits in the SMT and CFT and the primary vertex are used to constrain the fit, the impact parameter resolution is much\nimproved and corresponds roughly to what is expected from simulation studies. The impact parameter as a function of transverse momentum of charged\nparticles is shown both for data and simulation in Fig. 49. Figure 50 shows\na \"photometric\" picture in x/y view of the SMT. The precise tracking allows\nreconstruction of the xy coordinates of photon conversions in the detector\nmaterial. Different layers of the SMT are clearly seen in this picture.\n\nFig. 48. The impact parameter of charged tracks with transverse momentum large\nthan 3 GeV/c with respect the primary vertex.\n\nOperational difficulties have in many cases been peripheral to the silicon detector itself. These include latchup of operational amplifiers on the interface\nboards, low-voltage power supply failures, and high leakage currents in the\nhigh-voltage distribution boxes. However, the detectors themselves have suffered from some important problems and failures which are discussed in the\nfollowing sections. In the next section, some very noisy modules are described;\nin Sec.10.2, problems with the readout system are discussed, and finally the\n87\n\n\fFig. 49. The rms of the impact parameter distribution as a function of the transverse\nmomentum of charged particles is shown both for data and simulations.\n\naging problem due to radiation damages and a life time estimate are presented.\n\n10.1 Noise in the F-wedges\n\nA serious detector feature is the so-called \"grassy noise\" shown in Fig. 51,\nwhich is confined to the Micron-supplied F-disk detectors which correspond\nto 75% of the F-disk sensors. This noise is characterized by large charge spikes\nwhich cover 10\u201320 strips, and it occurs in about 20% of the events for affected\ndevices. Leakage currents typically rise to greater than 100 mA within 1 h of\nturn-on at the beginning of a store. The only major change in the grassy noise\nwas its onset about two months after the start of the run. Some of the devices\ncontinue to slowly increase their current draw. The current increases about\n100 mA after detectors are biased; these increases for a store which appear to\nbe charge-up effects with time constants of tens of minutes.\n88\n\n\fFig. 50. A \"photometric\" picture of the SMT produced by plotting reconstructed\ncoordinates of \u03b3-conversions.\n\n10.2 Performance of the Readout System\nAt the start-up in 2001, 95% of the ladders, 96% of the F-wedges and 87% of\nthe H-wedges were working. Over time, these numbers have varied, and Fig. 52\nshows the number of disabled modules from 2003 to 2010. The gaps in the\nfigure correspond to machine shutdowns. During each shutdown period, several\nmodules have been recovered by repair work to the external electronics and\ncabling. However, most of the disabled modules have problems in a inaccessible\narea, i.e., in the SVXIIe chips, in the HDIs, or in the low mass cables.\nMany of the problems with the chips arise because of an unwanted increase\nin the supply currents. This could happen if the SVXIIe stands idle for time\nperiods measured in hundreds of seconds; some of the supply currents increase\nby as much as a factor of 5. The cause of this has been traced to the use of\ndynamic CMOS memory in the chip. Figure 15 shows part of the schematic of\nthe SVXIIe. At the far right of the schematic, two capacitors are labeled Dout1\nand Dout2. These capacitors are examples of the dynamic CMOS memory\nused in the SVXIIe. In one half of a cycle, the capacitors are either set to a\nvoltage or to zero, and they are read in the second half of the cycle. However,\nif there is no clock signal, leakage currents slowly charge the capacitors. Since\nthese devices drive CMOS gates, the intermediate voltage will turn on both\n89\n\n\fFig. 51. Example of the grassy noise seen in the Micron-supplied F-disk detectors.\nIdeally, the entire plot would look like the region above channel 800.\n\nFraction of Disabled HDIs\n\nDisabled HDIs versus time (April 19, 2010)\n1\nBarrel HDIs\n0.9\n0.8\n\nF-Disk HDIs\nH-Disk HDIs\n\n0.7\n0.6\n0.5\n\n2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2012\n\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0\n0\n\n500\n\n1000\n\n1500\n\n2000\n2500\n3000\nDays since 1 Aug 2003\n\nFig. 52. The fraction of disabled HDIs as a function of time.\n\nthe n and p transistors, and the current will increase. This feature can lead\nto excessive chip currents and can evidently cause power wire-bond failure. A\nspecial signal is installed that cycles the SVXIIe every few seconds if there is\n90\n\n\fno beam to avoid the increasing current. However, in one incident, the loss of\nthe clock signal to the detector apparently caused the failure of several HDIs\ndue to power wire-bond failures. After that, a special watch-dog timer is under\ndevelopment that will shut off the chip power if the special signal fails.\nOne chip not working on an HDI due to a power wire-bond failure means that\nthe whole HDI is not functional and has to be disabled. However, it has been\npossible to recover most of the data from these HDIs. Since it is impossible\nto get to the HDIs, the repair was done from outside the detector. The wire\nbond that failed was for the digital power. The digital bus lines have protection\ndiodes to the digital power bus inside the chip, and there is a small resistor in\nseries with the diode to limit the current. It turned out to be possible to power\nthe chip from the bus lines. However, the resistor prevents enough power to\ndo an entire readout, but with the chip set to a very high threshold and in\nzero-suppressed mode, the entire string of chips except for the one that failed\nwas recovered.\nSince there is a diode drop in the protection diodes in the chip, the bus voltage has to run near 5 V. This is higher than the output of the standard bus\ndrivers so new adapter cards that provided the higher voltages were produced.\nThese new adapter cards were installed where needed in the 2007 and 2008\nshutdowns.\nAnother major failure appears to be from connector failures. One H-disk unit\non each side was removed to make room for a new inner layer Ref. [7] in\n2006. The two H-disks had numerous failures before being removed, and were\ninvestigated after the removal. It turned out that 14 out of 24 bad HDIs had\nno failures during extensive bench testing. The flexible tail is designed to take\ncare of slight cable mis-alignments. However, in the case of the H-disk, the tail\nwas over-constrained by a carbon fiber structure. If the low mass cable was\ninstalled at a slight angle in the plane of the cable, a small torque was placed\non the cable, which was evidently enough to cause the connectors to open.\nEight of the H-disk HDIs that had actually failed were further inspected.\nSix had a broken wire bond in the priority passing line. The other two had\nunknown failures. The cause of the wire bond failures appears to be the encapsulant. The encapsulant had re-liquefied and the re-liquefaction started at\nthe surface of the HDI. The H-disks are mounted vertically so when the encapsulant released from the HDI, any stress would be split between the one\nbond wire going across the chips and the 19 wires going along the chips. The\nevidence suggests that the stress on the one wire was too great and it failed.\nThe cause of the re-liquefaction of the encapsulant is not known.\nIn addition to the problems discussed above, the modules suffered from some\nrecoverable errors. The most common are a failure in the ring counter that\n91\n\n\fcontrols the pipeline and a failure to download properly. The ring counter\nerror is a design oversight in the chip. Its symptom is that in digitize mode it\nconnects a DC voltage to the comparator input rather than the output of a\ncapacitor. The only solution to this is to reset the pipeline counters. This error\nis induced by electrical noise, and the noise from a digitization and readout\nfrequently causes this error. To overcome this problem, the pipeline counters\nare reset after every readout. This also resets the pipeline, so any triggers in\nthe pipeline are lost.\n\n10.3 Radiation Damage\n\nThe lifetime of the SMT is expected to be limited by noise due to microdischarge breakdown in the inner layers, as discussed in Sec. 5. The microdischarge effect depends on bias voltage and becomes unacceptable at approximately 150 V. The bias voltage needed to deplete the detector modules\nchanges with the radiation dose they have received. To predict the lifetime of\nthe SMT, it is necessary to monitor the depletion voltage and the radiation\ndose. The inner layer of the inner four barrels consists of the DSDM silicon\nmodules which were measured to be the most sensitive to radiation. In addition, the inner layer receives the highest radiation dose. Therefore, this study\nis concentrated on the DSDM silicon modules in the inner layer.\n\n2000\n1800\n\nCurrent [\u03bcA]\n\n1600\n1400\n1200\n1000\n800\n600\n400\n200\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\nIntegrated Luminosity [fb-1]\n\n5\n\n6\n\nFig. 53. Evolution of the leakage current normalized to 20\u25e6 C with integrated luminosity.\n\nThe radiation dose received by a silicon module can be measured using the\nleakage current, which depends on flux according to the following formula:\nI = I0 + \u03b1 * \u03a6 * V,\n\n(1)\n92\n\n\fwhere I0 is the leakage current before irradiation, \u03b1 is the radiation damage\ncoefficient, \u03a6 is the particle flux, and V is the detector volume. The coefficient\n\u03b1 depends on the particle type, temperature, and time [17,28]. The particle\nflux is proportional to the integrated luminosity delivered by the Tevatron.\nTherefore the dependence of the leakage current on the integrated luminosity\nis also expected to be linear. In Fig. 53 the current is plotted versus the integrated luminosity for four DSDM silicon modules. It can be seen in the figure\nthat there is an almost linear dependence. The drop in the leakage current at\nfor example the integrated luminosity 0.6 fb\u22121 occurred because the SMT was\nwarmed up to 15\u25e6 C for more than one month, and the annealing processes accelerated. The inner silicon layer has two sub-layers: the inner sub-layer at radius 27.15 mm and the outer sub-layer at radius 36.45 mm. The radiation dose\ncollected by the outer sub-layer is about 1.6 times lower than the one at the inner sub-layer. Measurements of several silicon modules in the inner layer gave\na normalized particle flux from 4.0 \u00d7 1012 to 5.3 \u00d7 1012 particles/cm2 *fb\u22121 ,\ntaking annealing parameters from [28] and an asymptotic radiation damage\nconstant of 3 \u00d7 10\u221217 A*cm\u22121 . The spread reflects the accuracy of the method\nas well as possible non-uniformity of the radiation dose.\nThe silicon detector bulk material at D0 is slightly n-doped. Under radiation,\nhowever, donor states are removed and acceptor states created, eventually\nleading to a change from positive to negative space charge, i.e. the silicon\nbulk goes from being n-doped to becoming p-doped. This phenomenon is referred to as type inversion and has been confirmed by many experiments. It\nwas predicted that the type inversion at the D0 silicon bulk material would\nhappen when the integrated normalized particle flux reached approximately\n5 \u00d7 1012 particles/cm2 . At the point when the Tevatron had delivered about\n1 fb\u22121 , the inner layer was expected to have reached the type inversion point,\nwhere the depletion voltage is minimal. The following sections provide a description of depletion voltage measurements.\n\n10.3.1 Noise Level on the n-side\nWhile the silicon bulk material is n-doped, the noise of the n-side strips is\nlarge and constant at all voltages below the depletion voltage, and is reduced\nsignificantly when depletion is reached. Thus studying the n-side noise as a\nfunction of bias voltage can be used to determine the depletion voltage.\nIn a bias voltage scan, 11 runs are taken, with the high voltage settings varied\nfrom 0 to 100% in steps of 10%. The bias voltage scans were performed with\nand without beams in the Tevatron. The beam presence does not affect the\nmeasured depletion voltage values.\nThe DSDM and DS sensors show very different noise behavior as a function\n93\n\n\fof bias voltage. For that reason, different procedures are used for DSDM and\nDS devices.\nThe DSDM devices show a rather unexpected noise behavior as a function of\nbias voltage (see Fig. 54). There is no abrupt decrease in the noise level on the\nn-side when the depletion voltage is reached. Instead, the noise is decreasing\nrather monotonically with increasing bias voltage. For some HDIs, a small\nkink in the noise can be seen at a certain bias voltage, and the position of this\nkink changes as a function of the radiation dose. This kink is interpreted as\nan indication of the depletion voltage.\n\nFig. 54. Distribution of noise level on the n-side as a function of bias voltage for\na DSDM silicon module installed in the D0 detector. The bias voltage scans at\ndifferent integrated luminosities are shown. The depletion voltage at 0.3 fb\u22121 is\n25 V, at 0.5 fb\u22121 20 V, and at 0.9 and 1.0 fb\u22121 15 V.\n\nThe n-side noise was measured with a non-irradiated test DSDM module and\nabnormal behavior was not observed. This measurement indicates that the\nabnormal noise behavior is caused by the irradiation, and the comparison\nwith the DS modules shows that the radiation changes some properties of the\nPECVD layer.\n94\n\n\fMost of the DS devices show the expected noise behavior as a function of bias\nvoltage (see Fig. 55). At low voltages the noise is large, and rapidly decreases\nto a stable and lower level as soon as the bias voltage reaches the depletion\nvoltage. There is some indication of noise increase at bias voltages higher than\nthe depletion voltage after higher radiation doses.\n\nFig. 55. Distribution of noise level on the n-side as a function of bias voltage for a\nDS silicon module installed in the D0 detector. The bias voltage scans at different\nintegrated luminosities are shown.\n\n10.3.2 Charge Collection Efficiency\nAnother method for determining the depletion voltage uses the dependence\nof charge collection efficiency on bias voltage. For the silicon detectors with\nn-doped bulk material, the charge collection efficiency measured on the p-side\nincreases with bias voltage and reaches its maximum at full depletion. It is\npossible that there is some additional small increase after that, for example,\ndue to change of the charge collection time.\nThis method requires bias voltage scans with tracks in the detector. A special\n95\n\n\falgorithm has been developed for cluster reconstruction on the ladder under\nstudy in the vicinity of the expected track position. To determine the charge\ncollection efficiency, the cluster charge is measured. The bias voltage where\nthe charge collection efficiency reaches 95% of its asymptotic value has been\nidentified as the depletion voltage.\nThe depletion voltage measured using the charge collection efficiency shows\nagreement with the noise measurements.\n\nD\u2205 Silicon Detector Radiation Aging Status as of Jan. 2010\n200\n180\nFull Depletion Voltage [V]\n\n160\nB5-1-1\n\n140\n120\n100\n\nB1-2-5\n\n80\n60\n40\n\nB3-3-4\n\n20\n0\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\nIntegrated Luminosity [fb-1]\n\n10\n\n12\n\nFig. 56. Depletion voltage for silicon modules installed in the D0 detector for different radiation doses. The DSDM module is located at a radial distance from the\nbeam of 2.7 cm, the SS module at 3.6 cm and the DS module at a radial distance of\n4.4 cm. The lines represent theory predictions according to Ref. [17].\n\n10.3.3 Lifetime Estimate\nThe measurements of the radiation dose and depletion voltage allow us to compare the behavior of the silicon sensors installed in SMT with those irradiated\nat the Radiation Damage Facility (RDF) at Fermilab. A comparison shows\nthat the DSDM silicon modules irradiated at the RDF and those installed in\nthe SMT have a different dependence of the depletion voltage on the radiation dose. The depletion voltage for the DSDM irradiated sensors increases\nmuch faster than for the DS silicon detectors tested at the RDF (see Fig 21).\nFrom our measurement see Fig. 56, the behavior of depletion voltage for the\nDSDM silicon modules installed in the SMT is similar to the behavior of the\n96\n\n\fDS modules and is well described by standard parameterizations [17]. Assuming validity of DSDM detectors tests at RDF the discrepancy is probably\ndue to slow annealing of charge trapped in the insulator layer between metal\nlayers which was not measured in the RDF studies. Assuming this \"normal\"\nbehavior continues, the depletion voltage for the DSDM silicon sensors at the\ninner layer is predicted reach values around 150 V at a delivered luminosity\nof 8\u20139 fb\u22121 . It is seen that the micro-discharge for these ladders increase at\n110 V with the luminosity of 6.5 fb\u22121 , which could limit maximum operating\nvoltage for these ladders to less than 150 V.\n\n97\n\n\f11\n\nConclusion\n\nThe SMT contains a large variety of component types. It holds six different\ntypes of sensors, one sensor type is double sided, double metal; two are double\nsided; and three are single sided. Nine different types of flex circuit carrying the readout chips and other passive electronic components were needed\nto accommodate the various sensors and readout geometries. This variety of\ncomponents made the production of the detector challenging. Despite many\ndifficulties, the SMT was successfully assembled and installed at the start of\nTevatron Run II. The detector has worked well since then. However, due to\nradiation damage, the detector is aging and in order to compensate for this anticipated performance degradation and to improve the momentum resolution,\na new inner barrel layer, called Layer 0 was installed in 2006. A description of\nlayer 0 can be found in Ref. [7].\nThe SMT detector has been part of the D0 readout chain since the beginning\nof data taking in Run II, contributing to the almost two hundred interesting\nphysics publications by the D0 collaboration.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank the staff at Fermilab and in particular at SiDet, the D0 mechanical and electrical support personnel and all our d0 collaborators for there\nsupport.
