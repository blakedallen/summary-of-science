Low mass objects collapse at high redshift, and\nthen increase their mass by smooth accretion of dark matter or by merging with other haloes. Once a halo is accreted\nby a larger one, its diffuse outer layers are rapidly stripped\noff by tidal forces. However, the core, which is much denser,\ngenerally survives the accretion event and can still be recognized as a self bound structure or subhalo within the host\nhalo for some period of time afterwards.\nIn early N-body simulations, haloes appeared as fairly\nsmooth objects (Frenk et al. 1985, 1988). However, as\nthe attainable mass and force resolution has increased,\nsubhaloes have been identified and their properties studied\nin detail by many authors over the past decade (e.g.\nGhigna et al. 1998, 2000; Tormen et al. 1998; Moore et al.\n1999;\nKlypin et al.\n1999b,a;\nSpringel et al.\n2001;\nStoehr et al. 2002; De Lucia et al. 2004; Gao et al. 2004;\nNagai & Kravtsov 2005; Shaw et al. 2007; Diemand et al.\n2008; Springel et al. 2008). The properties of the subhalo\npopulation have important implications for galaxy formation, dark matter detection experiments and weak lensing.\nFor instance, subhaloes are expected to host satellite\ngalaxies within groups and clusters and their evolution\n\n\u2217 E-mail: raul.angulo@durham.ac.uk\n\nonce inside the host could give rise to observable changes.\nIn particular, a merger between two substructures could\ntrigger an episode of star formation or a morphological\ntransformation (e.g. Somerville & Primack 1999).\nIn spite of this, the merger history of subhaloes remains\nrelatively unexplored. This is a challenging problem which\ndemands a simulation with high mass and force resolution.\nIn particular, obtaining a statistical sample of mergers involving the largest substructures requires a large sample of\nhost haloes. Most studies of substructure in halos have focused on resimulating, at very high resolution, a small number of halos selected from a larger, lower resolution simulation. However, by studying only a few haloes, important\naspects related to variations produced by differences in the\naccretion and merger histories of haloes, as well as any influence of the environment, could remain hidden. This approach may also introduce systematic biases arising from the\ncriteria used to select the haloes to be resimulated.\nIn this paper, we overcome these problems by using the\nlargest dark matter simulation published to date, the Millennium Simulation (MS, Springel et al. 2005). The MS provides a large cosmological sample of dark matter haloes and\nassociated substructures spanning a considerable range in\nmass, allowing us to assess robustly the properties and fate\nof the subhalo population. We complement our results with\na higher resolution simulation of a smaller volume (hereafter\nHS) which has a particle mass almost ten times smaller than\nthat used in the MS (Jenkins et.al, in prep).\nThe layout of this paper is as follows. In Section 2, we\n\n\f2\n\nAngulo et al.\n\nbriefly describe the simulations used in this work along with\nthe properties of our halo and subhalo catalogues. In Section 3 we investigate some general properties of subhaloes,\nnamely their mass function, radial distribution and spatial\norientation with respect to their host halo. The exploration\nof substructure mergers and destruction is presented in Section 4. Finally, we summarize our findings in Section 5.\n\n2\n\nMETHOD\n\nIn this section we describe the N-body simulations we have\nanalyzed in this work. We also discuss the identification and\ncharacterization of the halo and subhalo catalogues.\n2.1\n\nN-body Simulations\n\nThe main simulation on which our analysis is based is the\nMillennium Simulation (Springel et al. 2005). The MS covers a comoving volume of 0.125 h\u22123 Gpc3 of a \u039bCDM universe in which the dark matter component is represented\nby 21603 particles. The assumed cosmological parameters\nare in broad agreement with those derived from joint analyses of the 2dFGRS galaxy clustering (Percival et al. 2001)\nand WMAP1 microwave background data (Spergel et al.\n2003; S\u00e1nchez et al. 2006), as well as with those derived\nfrom WMAP5 data (Komatsu et al. 2008). In particular,\nthe total mass-energy density, in units of the critical density, is \u03a9m = \u03a9dm + \u03a9b = 0.25, where the two terms\nrefer to dark matter and baryons, with \u03a9b = 0.045; the\namplitude of the linear density fluctuations in 8h\u22121 Mpc\nspheres is \u03c38 = 0.9; and the Hubble constant is set to\nh = H0 /(100 kms\u22121 Mpc\u22121 ) = 0.73. The particle mass is\nmp = 8.6 \u00d7 108 h\u22121 M\u2299 and the Plummer-equivalent softening of the gravitational force is \u01eb = 5 h\u22121 kpc.\nTo complement our results and to test for numerical\neffects we have also employed another simulation with better mass resolution to which we refer as HS. This simulation follows 9003 dark matter particles in a \u039bCDM cube of\nside 100 h\u22121 Mpc. The HS assumes the same cosmological\nparameters as the MS. However, the smaller box yields a\nsmaller particle mass, mp = 9.5 \u00d7 107 h\u22121 M\u2299 , so objects of\na given mass are resolved with almost 10 times more particles than in the MS. Finally, in the HS the softening length\nis \u01eb = 2.4 h\u22121 kpc.\nThe MS and HS were carried out using a memory efficient version of the Gadget-2 code (Springel 2005).\n2.2\n\nHalo and Subhalo catalogues\n\nIn both simulations, particle positions and velocities are\nwritten at 64 output times which, for z < 2, are roughly\nequally spaced in time by 300 Myr. In each of these outputs\nwe have identified dark matter haloes using the friends-offriends (FoF) algorithm (Davis et al. 1985), with a linking\nlength of 0.2 times the mean interparticle separation. The\nvolume and particle number of the MS provide a unique\nresource of well resolved haloes to study. By way of illustration, there are 90891 haloes at z = 0 with mass in excess\nof 5.4 \u00d7 1012 h\u22121 M\u2299 (one of the bins we use below), which\ncorresponds to 6272 particles; at z = 1 the number of haloes\nin excess of this mass is still 61481. On the cluster-mass\n\nscale, for example, there are 356 haloes at z = 0 which are\nmore massive than 4\u00d71014 h\u22121 M\u2299 , corresponding to 464576\nparticles.\nWell resolved FoF haloes are not smooth, but contain\na considerable amount of mass in the form of substructures.\nThese dark matter clumps or \"subhaloes\" are identified and\ncatalogued using a modified version of the subhalo finder\nalgorithm, SUBFIND, originally presented in Springel et al.\n(2001). The statistics of the subhalo catalogue are impressive. At z = 0 SUBFIND lists 339840 structures with more\nthan 200 particles in the MS within haloes of at least\n5.4 \u00d7 1012 h\u22121 M\u2299 . At z = 1 there are 194629 substructures\nwith the same characteristics. Note that SUBFIND not only\nfinds substructures within a FoF halo, but it is also capable\nof identifying substructures within substructures.\nAn important issue for studies of substructures is the\ndefinition of the boundary and position of the host halo. In\nour analysis, the centre of the halo is defined as the position\nof the most bound particle (i.e. usually the one possessing\nthe minimum gravitational potential). This choice for the\nhalo position agrees, within the softening length, with that\nfound by a shrinking sphere algorithm (Power et al. 2003)\nfor 93% of the haloes that are resolved with 450 or more\nparticles. As shown by Neto et al. (2007), the 7% of cases\nin which the two methods disagree are due to the FoF algorithm artificially linking multiple structures. In these cases\nthe position of the most bound particle provides a more\nrobust identification of the centre, as noted by Neto et al.\n(2007).\nWe define the halo boundary as the sphere of radius\nr200 which contains a mean density of 200 times the critical\ndensity, \u03c1crit . Therefore, the mass of the halo is:\n\nM200 =\n\n4\n3\n\u03c0200\u03c1crit r200\n.\n3\n\n(1)\n\nWe keep in our catalogues only subhaloes within this\nsphere. Although the choice of the factor of 200 is motivated\nby the spherical collapse model in a Einstein-de-Sitter universe, it is somewhat arbitrary for our \u039bCDM simulations.\nHowever, the r200 definition has the advantage of being independent of both redshift and cosmology. Moreover, it has\nbecame a de facto standard in studies of substructures. Nevertheless, we have tested our results against other definitions\nof the halo boundary without finding any qualitative differences. In the following, when we refer to the mass and radius\nof a host halo, we always mean M200 and r200 .\nFinally, we build merger trees using an algorithm similar to that described by Springel et al. (2005) which follows\nthe evolution of subhaloes. In this way, we can identify the\nhaloes and subhaloes that will be involved in a merger during\na subsequent snapshot. Note that these merger trees are constructed using only the information contained in the FoF and\nSUBFIND catalogues, and there is no attempt to force mass\nconservation, as would be required if the merger trees were to\nbe used in a galaxy formation code (see Harker et al. 2006).\nThe descendant of a subhalo is defined as the structure that\ncontains the majority of the 10 percent most bound particles from the subhalo. When two satellite subhaloes have\nthe same descendant in a following snapshot, we tag such\nan event as a substructure merger.\n\n\fThe Fate of Substructures in Dark Matter Haloes\n\n3\n\nFigure 1. Top row: Differential number of substructures per host halo as a function of their mass relative to that of the host halo,\nMsub /Mhost . Note this is the mass of the subhalo at the redshift labelled, in some cases after substantial stripping of mass has taken\nplace. Solid lines show the results from the MS while dashed lines show the results from the HS. In both cases, lines of different colours\nshow the subhalo mass function in host haloes of different masses (as indicated by the legend). Each column shows a different redshift,\nas labelled. At each redshift, the dotted lines display the overall best fit of our model, Eq. 2, with the parameter values given in the\nlegend. Parameters of the fits to individual mass bins at z = 0 are listed in Table 1. Bottom row: Relative difference between the overall\nbest fit and measurements of the subhalo mass function for different host masses. The dot-dashed line shows the difference between our\nmodel, Eq. 2, and a power-law fit. Only results for subhaloes which are resolved with more than 50 particles are shown.\n\n3\n\nSUBHALO PROPERTIES\n\nBefore presenting our results regarding subhalo mergers, we\nconsider some general properties of the subhalo population.\nAlthough some of these properties have been studied by previous authors, the large volume and high resolution of the\nMS and HS reveal some features which were inaccessible\nto earlier work. Furthermore, the knowledge of the subhalo\nproperties will help us to understand the results presented\nin the next section.\n\n3.1\n\nSubhalo mass function\n\nWe first consider the distribution of subhalo masses - the\nsubhalo mass function. The top panels of Fig. 1 show the\nmean number of substructures within dark matter haloes,\nper host halo, per logarithmic interval in subhalo mass. The\nresults are displayed as a function of subhalo mass relative\nto the mass of the halo in which it resides, Msub /Mhost . In\nthis way we can easily compare results across a range of\nhalo masses. In the ranges of overlap, the results from the\nMS and HS agree well; this provides a useful, but limited,\ntest of the convergence of our results.\nFor the redshifts plotted in Fig. 1 there is only a small\nvariation of the subhalo mass function with host halo mass.\nIndeed, a universal function describes the behaviour reasonably well over the range of subhalo mass resolved by our\nsimulations:\n\ndN\n=A\nd ln(Msub /Mhost )\n\n\u201e\n\nMsub\nMhost\n\n\u00ab\u03b1\n\n\"\n\n1\nexp \u2212 2\n\u03c3\n\n\u201e\n\nMsub\nMhost\n\n\u00ab2 #\n\n, (2)\n\nwhere N is the number of subhaloes per host halo. The values of A, \u03b1 and \u03c3 in this overall fit at each redshift are given\nin the legend of Fig. 1. For this overall fit, we have forced\nthe slope \u03b1 to have the same value independently of redshift.\nIn general, we find that \u03b1 = \u22120.9 is a good approximation\nto the best fit from z = 0 to z = 2.5. It is also important\nto note that the power-law fit widely used in the literature,\n(e.g. Gao et al. 2004) is only valid over a limited range of\nfractional subhalo masses, Msub /Mhost < 0.04. We also see\nthat the maximum subhalo mass for which a power-law successfully describes the mass function decreases at higher redshifts, Msub /Mhost \u223c 0.015 at z = 1 and Msub /Mhost \u223c 0.04\nat z = 0. The bottom panels of Fig. 1 show the relative\ndifference between the fit given by Eq. (2) and the mass\nfunction of subhaloes measured in host haloes of different\nmasses.\nWe have also fitted Eq. 2 to the subhalo mass functions in each halo mass bin, this time letting the slope \u03b1\nvary; we list the best-fit parameters for z = 0 in Table 1. At\nthe low fractional mass end, where the subhalo mass function behaves as a power-law, we generally find slopes that\nare lower than the critical value, \u03b1 = \u22121 (which separates\ndivergent from convergent mass functions).

(6) The minimum fractional\nsubhalo mass included in the fitting.\n\nfrom \u22120.8 to \u22121.0 (Moore et al. 1999; Ghigna et al. 2000;\nDe Lucia et al. 2004; Gao et al. 2004; Diemand et al. 2004;\nShaw et al. 2007; Diemand et al. 2007). In particular, our results agree with those from the much higher resolution simulations of individual galactic halos of Springel et al. (2008),\nbut are inconsistent with the steeper slope advocated, also\nfor galactic halos, by Diemand et al. (2008).\nAt the high mass end, the subhalo mass function departs from a power-law and decreases exponentially. This\nbehaviour was previously detected in N-body simulations\n(at lower significance) by Giocoli et al. (2008) (and predicted analytically by van den Bosch et al. 2005). However,\nthis feature was not apparent in earlier studies which used\nresimulations of individual haloes. Resimulations of single\nobjects have the advantage that computational effort can\nbe focused. A halo can be resolved with a vast number of\nparticles and its substructures identified over a large range\nof masses. Unfortunately, this approach comes at the price\nof losing the rich information contained in the variety of assembly histories, relaxation states and, more importantly,\nthe population of high mass subhaloes. As can be seen from\nFig. 1, the abundance of these objects is much lower than\nthat of smaller subhaloes \u2013 usually we would find just a few\nin each halo. Because these halos are so rare, the damping\nof the power-law at high Msub /Mhost is missed in individual\nresimulations. By contrast, with the huge sample of haloes\nand their massive subhaloes in our analysis, we can robustly\nprobe this subhalo mass range.\nEven though the subhalo mass function appears roughly\nuniversal (e.g. Moore et al. 1999), we have detected at every\nredshift a small dependence on the mass of the host system.\nSmall substructures of the same fractional mass are more\nabundant in high mass haloes than in low mass haloes. This\ncorrelation has also been seen in a number of other studies (e.g. Gao et al. 2004; Shaw et al. 2007; Diemand et al.\n2007). However, we also find evidence that this trend holds\nonly in the power-law region of the subalo mass function and\nactually reverses at the high mass end - low mass haloes seem\nto host relatively more massive subhaloes than do high mass\nhaloes.\nPerhaps surprisingly, the variety of features present in\n\nthe mass function of subhaloes is consistent with a relatively\nsimple picture. There are two key ingredients that shape the\nsubhalo mass function: (i) the mass function of infalling objects and (ii) the dynamical evolution of subhaloes orbiting\nwithin the host halo due to dynamical friction and tidal\nstripping. The first of these is responsible for the universality described above and sets the subhalo mass function\nto first order. As first found by Lacey & Cole (1993) using the extended Press Schechter formalism, and confirmed\nby Giocoli et al. (2008) using N-body simulations, the mass\nfunction of subhaloes at infall is almost independent of host\nhalo mass and redshift when expressed as a function of\nMsub /Mhost , and can be described as a power-law with a\nhigh mass cut-off.\nAfter subhaloes fall into a host halo, their orbits sink\ndue to dynamical friction and, at the same time, the subhaloes lose mass due to tidal stripping. These processes\ncause the subhalo mass function to evolve away from its\nform at infall. The rates for these processes depend on the\nfractional mass of the subhalo, Msub /Mhost , and on the dynamical timescale of the host halo. Therefore, if all haloes\nhad identical structure and assembly histories, these processes would preserve a universal form for the subhalo mass\nfunction, independently of Mhost . However, haloes of different masses on average assemble at different redshifts in spite\nof the similar mass function of subhaloes at infall, and this\nbreaks the universal shape of the subhalo mass function, as\ndiscussed by van den Bosch et al. (2005) and Giocoli et al.\n(2008). On average, massive haloes are younger than their\nless massive counterparts and they are more likely to have\nexperienced recent mergers (Lacey & Cole 1993). These provide a fresh source of substructures which have had less\ntime for orbit decay due to dynamical friction and to be\ntidally stripped. High mass haloes are therefore expected to\nhave more substructures than low mass haloes. Another effect which acts in the same direction is that small haloes\ntend to accrete their subhaloes at higher redshifts when dynamical timescales are shorter. As a result, they strip out\nmass from the substructures more quickly than large haloes,\nwhere massive substructures can survive for longer.\n3.2\n\nMost massive subhaloes\n\nThe high-mass tail of the distribution of substructure is\nexamined in greater detail in Fig. 2. The three panels in\nthis plot display the distribution of the fractional mass,\nMsub /Mhost , for the first, second and third largest substructures within haloes of different mass at z = 0. As before,\nresults from the MS and HS agree very well.\nIn contrast to the results presented in the previous subsection, the distributions of fractional masses seem to be\nindependent of the host halo mass. (We have also checked\nthat they are independent of redshift.) In particular, in every\nhalo, the fractional masses follow a log-normal distribution\nwith mean hlog10 (Msub /Mhost )i = \u22121.42, \u22121.79 and \u22121.99,\nand standard deviation \u03c3log10 (Msub /Mhost ) = 0.517, 0.382 and\n0.348 for the each of the three largest subhaloes respectively.\nAlbeit with considerable scatter, these values imply that the\nmost massive substructure contains typically 3.7% of the total mass of the halo while the second and third most massive\nsubhaloes contain 1.6% and 1% of the mass respectively.\nDue to the large dispersions, the distributions can only\n\n\fThe Fate of Substructures in Dark Matter Haloes\n\n5\n\nGiocoli et al. 2008). The large scatter must then result from\nthe large range of accretion histories at a given host halo\nmass. We leave further investigation of these ideas for future work.\n3.3\n\nFigure 2. The distribution of the fractional mass, Msub /Mhost ,\nof the 1st, 2nd and 3rd largest substructures in haloes of different\nmass at z = 0. The solid lines show the results from the MS while\nthe dashed lines show the results from the HS. In each panel, the\nblack solid lines indicate the log-normal function that best fits our\nresults. Note that only substructures resolved with 20 particles or\nmore are displayed.\n\nbe measured reliably in haloes resolved with a large number\nof particles. For instance, the mean fractional mass of subhaloes is overestimated for haloes resolved with fewer than\n\u223c 1000 particles (the exact limit depends on the scatter and\nmean of the true distribution), i.e. \u223c 1 \u00d7 1012 h\u22121 M\u2299 in the\nMS and \u223c 1 \u00d7 1011 h\u22121 M\u2299 in the HS. The upward bias is\ncaused by the finite resolution of the simulations (there is\na limit on the smallest subhalo that we can identify) which\ntruncates the low mass tail of the distribution of fractional\nmasses.\nHints of a universal behaviour of the fractional\nmasses of the largest subhaloes were already detected by\nDe Lucia et al. (2004) (although they claim a weak dependence with host halo mass). Our results are broadly consistent with theirs but, with the large halo catalogues from\nthe MS and HS, we are able to probe the full probability\ndistribution function robustly.\nThe apparently universal shape of these distributions\ncould, in principle, be understood within the broad picture just discussed. Presumably it reflects the distribution\nof masses of the infalling haloes which, as we have seen,\nis independent of the host halo mass (Lacey & Cole 1993;\n\nRadial distribution of subhaloes\n\nFig. 3 shows the number density of subhaloes as a function of\nradius, relative to the mean number density of substructures\nwithin r200 in the same fractional mass range. Each panel\nfocuses on substructures of different masses, from small subhaloes (10\u22124 < Msub /Mhost < 10\u22123 ) in the leftmost panel to\nlarge ones (10\u22122 < Msub /Mhost < 1) in the rightmost panel.\nAs in previous plots, lines of different colours show results\nfor subhaloes that reside in haloes of different mass, and the\ndifferent line types (solid and dashed) indicate the results\nfor the two simulations. We also plot the radial profile of\nthe dark matter as a black dotted line in each panel.\nComparison of the MS and HS indicates that our results are insensitive to the mass resolution (although the\noverlap between the two simulations is limited). As in previous studies (e.g. Gao et al. 2004), we find that the radial distribution has little dependence on the host halo\nmass at a given Msub /Mhost . This is quite remarkable since\neach panel mixes subhaloes that: (i) are resolved by numbers of particles that differ by orders of magnitude and (ii)\noccupy haloes which are in a variety of dynamical states\n(age, relaxation, etc). We also see that in all cases, the\nradial distribution of subhaloes is less centrally concentrated than the dark matter, as was also found in previous studies (e.g. Ghigna et al. 1998, 2000; Gao et al. 2004;\nDiemand et al. 2004; Nagai & Kravtsov 2005; Shaw et al.\n2007; Springel et al. 2008).\nIn addition, we see a significant difference between the\ndistribution of massive subhaloes (Msub > 10\u22122 Mhost ) and\nthat of small ones (Msub < 10\u22123 Mhost ). While the overall\nradial profiles seem to be fairly independent of subhalo mass,\nthe more massive subhalos tend to avoid the central regions\nof the host halo, while the less massive ones have a more\ncentrally concentrated distribution (see also De Lucia et al.\n2004). However, the distributions agree in the outer parts of\nthe halo. Springel et al. (2008) found a similar effect to ours\nin the Aquarius set of simulations of galactic halos which,\nalthough limited in number, span a huge dynamic range in\nsubhalo mass.\nThese dissimilar density profiles for different subhalo masses have a simple dynamical explanation (e.g.\nTormen et al. 1998; Nagai & Kravtsov 2005). Once a halo\nfalls into a more massive system, dynamical friction and\ntidal striping start to act. The accreted subhalo will rapidly\nbe stripped of its outer layers and will lose a significant\nfraction of its mass during the first pericentric passage. This\nmechanism naturally differentiates the radial distribution of\nsubstructures of different masses: massive structures sink\nmore rapidly due to dynamical friction and, as a result, also\nlose mass more quickly by tidal stripping. Therefore they do\nnot survive long in the central regions, in contrast to small\nsubhaloes. The massive subhaloes which are present in the\nhalo must have been accreted more recently than the average low mass subhalo. The timescale for dynamical friction\ndepends on the relative mass of the subhalo and its host\nhalo, not on their absolute values, which would explain the\n\n\f6\n\nAngulo et al.\n\nFigure 3.

Previous work has examined the relationship between the angular distribution of\nsubstructures and the shape of the host halo (Tormen 1997;\nLibeskind et al. 2007; Knebe et al. 2008a,b). Here, we examine instead the orientation relative to the spin axis of the\nhost halo. Fig. 4 shows the probability distribution function\nof the cosine of the angle between the angular momentum\nvector of the host halo and the vector joining its centre with\nthat of the subhalo. We show results for two separate ranges\nof subhalo mass: subhaloes with mass smaller than 2% of\nthe host halo mass (dashed lines) and those with masses\ngreater than 2% (solid lines). We distinguish different host\nhalo masses by different colours, and show different redshifts\nin different panels. Note that we only display results for the\nMS simulation for clarity.\nAs shown by Bett et al. (2007), the accuracy of the measurement of spin direction in the MS degrades significantly\n(uncertainty > 15 deg) for haloes resolved with fewer than\n\n|j|\n< 10\u22121.4 ,\nG Mhost Rhost\n\n(3)\n\nwhere G is Newton's gravitational constant. Although the\ninclusion of haloes that do not satisfy these criteria does not\nseem to affect our results quantitatively, we have chosen to\nshow only those haloes that met these requirements, so that\nthe angle relative to the spin axis can be reliably determined.\nWe see from Fig. 4 that the angular distribution of\nsubhaloes tends to be aligned perpendicular to the spin\naxis of the host halo. (We remind the reader that in this\nplot, an isotropic angular distribution would correspond to\na horizontal line, while a distribution aligned at 90 deg to\nthe spin axis will peak around cos \u03b8 \u223c 0.) The strength\nof this alignment effect depends on the fractional subhalo\nmass, Msub /Mhost , being much stronger for higher mass subhaloes. We also see that the angular distribution for a given\nMsub /Mhost is almost independent of the host halo mass and\nthe redshift (see also Kang et al. 2007).\nWe can understand this behaviour qualitatively as reflecting the growth of haloes by the accretion of dark matter\n(in halos or more diffuse form) along filaments. The central\nregions of haloes acquire most of their angular momentum\n\n\fThe Fate of Substructures in Dark Matter Haloes\n\n7\n\nfaster) and tidal stripping (which converts high-mass subhaloes to low mass). We expect subhaloes increasingly to\nlose memory of their initial infall direction the longer they\nhave orbited in the host halo (which in general is lumpy and\ntriaxial). Since high Msub /Mhost subhaloes have undergone\nfewer orbits, their current angular distribution should be\nmore closely aligned with their infall direction, and therefore with the current filament, compared to subhaloes of\nlower mass.\nOur results seem generally consistent with previous simulation results on the alignment of the subhalo distribution\nwith the shape of the host halo, and the relationship between the shapes and the spin axes of halos. Tormen (1997)\nfound that the angular distribution of subhaloes as they fall\ninto a host halo (crossing through r200 ) is anisotropic, and\ntends to be aligned along the major axis of the host halo.\nPrevious studies (e.g. Knebe et al. 2004; Zentner et al. 2005;\nLibeskind et al. 2007) found that the angular distribution\nof subhaloes within a host halo is aligned along the major\naxis of the host halo. On the other hand, Bett et al. (2007)\nshowed that the angular momentum of a halo is generally\naligned with its minor axis and perpendicular to its major axis. Putting these results together, we would expect\nthe subhalo distribution to be aligned perpendicular to the\nspin axis of the host halo, but ours is the first study to\ndemonstrate this directly, and also to demonstrate that the\nstrength of the alignment depends on subhalo mass.\n\n4\n\nFigure 4. The probability density distribution of the cosine of\nthe angle \u03b8 between the angular momentum vector of the host\nhalo and the vector joining its centre with that of the subhalo.\nEach panel shows results for a different redshift, as indicated by\nthe label. The lines in each panel display the distribution for\nsubhaloes in two different mass bins: 0.02 < Msub /Mhost < 1\n(solid lines) and 0.004 < Msub /Mhost < 0.02 (dashed lines). Lines\nof different colour indicate subhaloes residing in host haloes of\ndifferent masses, as shown in the legend. An isotropic angular\ndistribution corresponds to a horizontal line.\n\nat a relatively late stage from the orbital angular momentum of this infalling material, and so will tend to have spin\naxes perpendicular to the current filament (e.g Shaw et al.\n2006; Arag\u00f3n-Calvo et al. 2007). On the other hand, insofar\nas the subhaloes \"remember\" the direction from which they\nfell in once they are orbiting inside the host halo, then their\nspatial distribution will tend to be aligned with the filament\nfrom which they were accreted, and so will be perpendicular\nto the spin axis. We can also understand the dependence\nof the strength of this alignment on subhalo mass in this\npicture. Subhaloes with large Msub /Mhost on average have\nbeen orbiting in the host halo for less time than haloes of\nlower Msub /Mhost , due to the combined effects of dynamical friction (which causes higher mass subhaloes to sink\n\nMERGERS BETWEEN SUBHALOES\n\nAs we have seen, once a halo is accreted by a larger one, its\nouter layers are rapidly stripped by tidal forces. However,\nthe core generally survives the accretion event and can still\nbe recognized as a substructure or satellite subhalo within\nthe host halo for some time afterwards. Furthermore, not\nonly may the main infalling halo survive, but also substructures within it. In this case, there are substructures inside\nsubstructures.\nWhile orbiting inside the halo, dynamical friction causes\nthe orbit of a subhalo to lose energy and to sink towards the\ncentre of the host halo. As the subhalo sinks, it suffers further tidal stripping. Eventually, the subhalo may be totally\ndisrupted: there is a merger between the satellite subhalo\nand the central subhalo. Nevertheless, on its way to destruction, a subhalo can survive for several orbits during which\nit may experience a merger with another satellite subhalo.\nIn the following subsections we will investigate the merging\nof these substructures.\nThe interaction between subhaloes was previously investigated in cosmological simulations by Tormen et al.\n(1998), who studied the rate of penetrating encounters\nbetween satellite subhaloes, but not the merger rate.\nMakino & Hut (1997) derived an expression for the merger\nrate between subhaloes in galaxy clusters based on an entirely different approach, motivated by the kinetic theory\nof gases. In this case, the merger rate per unit volume between halos of mass M1 and M2 is Rmerge = n1 n2 \u03c3(v12 )v12 ,\nwhere n1 and n2 are the respective number densities, v12 is\nthe relative velocity, and \u03c3(v12 ) is the merger cross-section.\nThey used N-body simulations of isolated spherical halos to\nderive merger cross-sections for equal-mass halos as a func-\n\n\f8\n\nAngulo et al.\n\nFigure 5.

Two cases are displayed: the number of satellites destroyed\nor merging with the main substructure (top thin lines) and the number of mergers between two satellites (thick bottom lines). The solid\nlines show results from the MS while the dashed lines show results from the HS. As indicated by the legend, in both cases, coloured lines\nrepresent results for haloes of different mass. The three panels are for three different redshifts: z = 1.0, z = 0.5 and z = 0. Note that in\nthe case of the merger between a satellite and a central structure, we show examples involving subhaloes of at least 200 particles, but\nwe reduce the limit to 50 particles in the case of mergers between two satellites. In each panel, the legend states the redshift, the age of\nthe universe, tH , and the time interval, dt, over which we measure the rates.\n\ntion of their relative velocity, and then assumed that mergers in clusters occurred between pairs of subhaloes drawn\nfrom random uncorrelated orbits, with a Maxwellian distribution of relative velocities. The Makino & Hut expression was then extrapolated to the case of unequal subhalo masses and incorporated into a semi-analytical model\nof galaxy formation by Somerville & Primack (1999) and\nHatton et al. (2003). We will investigate below whether the\nMakino & Hut (1997) kinetic theory approach has any applicability to subhalo mergers in a realistic cosmological context.\n\n4.1\n\nSubhalo merger rate\n\nFig. 5 shows the mean merger rate of satellite subhaloes,\nplotted against the fractional mass of its progenitor. This is\nthe mass of the satellite before accretion divided by the mass\nof the host halo at the time of the merger. The rate is normalized per subhalo, with time in units of the age of the universe at that redshift. This normalized rate is thus roughly\nequal to the probability that a satellite subhalo will merge\nover one Hubble expansion time. A rate higher than unity indicates that the process happens on a timescale shorter than\na Hubble time. There are two sets of curves in this figure: (i)\nthe thinner, higher amplitude lines which show mergers between a satellite and a central subhalo, as a function of the\nsubhalo mass, and (ii) the thick lines which correspond to\nsatellite-satellite mergers, plotted as a function of the mass\nof the smaller subhalo. As in previous plots, different line\n\ncolours show different host halo masses, and different line\nstyles (solid and dashed) show the two simulations used.\nWe see from Fig. 5 that over most of the subhalo mass\nrange resolved by our simulations (for Msub /Mhost & 10\u22123 ),\nit is more likely for a satellite subhalo to merge with the\ncentral subhalo than with another more massive satellite\nsubhalo. For instance, at z = 1, taking into account all host\nhaloes, there are 17155 satellites which merge with a central\nsubhalo over one timestep, while the number of satellites\ninvolved in a merger with another satellite over the same\nperiod is 509, a ratio of 40 : 1. The situation is similar at\nz = 0 even though the ratio decreases to 6 : 1 (1645 vs 290).\nIn general, the likelihood of both merger rates slightly decreases at lower redshifts. This may reflect the slower buildup of structure (relative to the Hubble time) as the universe\nbecomes dominated by vacuum energy.\nAs we consider smaller subhalo masses, we see a decrease in the destruction rate (see the appendix for a discussion of overmerging effects due to insufficient mass resolution). This may be due to the inefficiency of dynamical friction for low mass structures. On the other hand,\nthere is an increase in the satellite-satellite merger rate as\nthe subhalo mass decreases. Presumably this is due to the\nincreasing number of potential merger partners, reflecting\nthe form of the subhalo mass function. Additionally, the\nabundance of both types of mergers is similar in the range\n10\u22123 < Msub /Mhost < 10\u22122 . Unfortunately, at this point\nour results from low mass haloes become limited by resolution (i.e. we cannot identify smaller substructures) and the\nresults from high mass haloes become dominated by Poisson\n\n\fThe Fate of Substructures in Dark Matter Haloes\n\nFigure 6. The number density of subhalo-subhalo mergers relative to the mean density of subhaloes within r200 as a function\nof the distance to the centre of the host halo. The results from\nthe MS are shown by solid lines while the results from the HS are\nshown by dashed lines. In each subpanel the dotted lines show the\nradial distribution of all subhaloes (regardless of whether they are\nmerging or not) in the MS. Mergers involving subhaloes resolved\nwith at least 50 particles are included in the plot.\n\nnoise (i.e. less than one merger event in the whole simulation). Over the range that is reliably covered, we can see no\nstrong systematic differences in Fig. 5 between the results\nderived from host haloes of different masses. This agreement is quite remarkable given the relatively large dynamical range resolved in the simulations.\nA merger between two objects is not always a straightforward quantity to define in numerical simulations. The\nproblem originates from the fact that any definition is intrinsically linked to the mass and time resolution of the\nsimulation. For instance, if in a higher resolution simulation we identify the remnant of a subhalo down to a smaller\nmass threshold, then the mass ratio of the merger, as well\nas the time at which it happens, could, in principle, disagree\nwith the values measured in a lower resolution simulation.\nSimilarly, with better time resolution, one could follow the\nmass loss of a subhalo more accurately which, in principle,\ncould also change the measured mass ratio of the merger.\nTo avoid these problems, we have chosen to use in Fig. 5 the\nmass of the satellite before accretion, rather than the mass\nat the moment of the merger.\nFor all these reasons it is very important to note the\nagreement in Fig. 5 between the results from the MS (solid\nlines) and those from the HS (dashed lines). This agreement gives us confidence that our results are not sensitive\nto mass resolution. (Note that this is not true for subhaloes\nresolved with fewer particles as shown in the appendix.) Furthermore, the weak dependence of the quantities plotted in\nFig. 5 on host halo mass confirms this conclusion. In practice, a subhalo of Msub /Mhost = 0.1 in a host of 1012 h\u22121 M\u2299\n\n9\n\nexhibits the same behaviour as a subhalo of the same fractional mass but in a halo of 1014 h\u22121 M\u2299 even though the\nlatter is resolved with 100 times more particles. This is quite\nremarkable.\nOne of the reasons for the insensitivity to mass resolution comes from our definition of a merger (see \u00a72.2). We do\nnot tag an event as a merger when we cannot identify the\nsubhalo anymore, but rather when it has lost a fixed fraction of its most bound mass. This definition responds more\nto dynamical processes than to numerical ones.\nThe implications of discrete time measurements are less\nclear for our definition of a merger. As an example, consider\nthe case of very poor time resolution, and a halo that is\njust about to fall into a larger one. If tidal forces stripped\noff more than 95% of its mass before the next snapshot,\nthen we would have identified this event as a merger. On\nthe other hand, if the time resolution were good enough,\nwe could have identified the subhalo at intermediate stages,\nupdating its mass and the corresponding most bound 10\npercent. As long as stripping does not occur on a timescale\nmuch shorter than the time resolution, it is even possible to\nimagine that the line of descendants continues indefinitely.\nHowever, since a merger is not a discrete event, better time\nresolution does not necessarily imply a more accurate determination of a merger. With infinite time resolution, we\nwould follow most of the merging process down to the point\nwhen mass resolution becomes important, i.e. every subhalo\ndisruption would be caused by lack of mass resolution.\nHowever, the typical timescale for dynamical friction\nand tidal disruption is Tfric \u223c tH for Msub /Mhost \u223c 0.1 \u2212 0.2\n(Jiang et al. 2008), i.e. much longer than the time spacing of\nour simulation outputs (\u223c 300Myr). Furthermore, subhalo\nmergers seem to take place very fast. Both these factors\nsuggest that time resolution is not an issue for this study. In\nfact, we have checked that our results do not change if we\nchoose snapshots that are twice as widely spaced as those\nused to build the merger trees. Nevertheless, we advise the\nreader to keep these limitations in mind.\n\n4.2\n\nCharacterization of subhalo-subhalo mergers\n\nIn most cases the subhalo-central merger occurs very close\nto the potential minimum of the host halo. The spatial location of satellite-satellite mergers, on the other hand, has a\nvery distinctive distribution. In the following subsection we\ninvestigate this further.\n\n4.2.1\n\nRadial distribution of satellite-satellite mergers\n\nFirst, in Fig. 6 we look at the spherically averaged radial\ndistribution of satellite-satellite mergers. The figure shows\nthe number density of mergers, relative to the mean density\nof subhaloes within r200 , as a function of the distance to\nthe centre of the halo. We also display, as dotted lines, the\ndistribution of all the substructures from the MS1 .\n1 At first sight, the distribution of all substructures seems to disagree with the results of Section 3.3. Since the subhalo population\nis dominated by small mass objects, one would naively expect the\ndistribution of all substructures to follow that of the smallest subhaloes; as seen in Fig. 3, this has a slope which is always negative.\n\n\f10\n\nAngulo et al.\n\nFigure 7. Probability distribution of the cosine of the separation angle \u03b8 between the progenitors of two substructures that\nare going to merge. The separation angle is measured at the last\nsnapshot in which the subhaloes were identified outside the halo\nthat hosts the satellite-satellite merger. Lines of different colours\nindicate mergers happening in haloes of different masses as indicated in the legend.\n\nAt every redshift plotted, the radial distribution of\nmergers is proportional to the radial distribution of subhaloes. This implies that most of the mergers between subhaloes do indeed occur in the outer regions of the host halo.\nNote that in these regions the background density is lower\nthan in the inner regions, making it easier to identify subhaloes. For this reason, we can follow satellite-satellite mergers down to structures resolved with 50 particles, as opposed to the minimum of 200 particles we require for centralsatellite mergers.\nOur results do not appear consistent with the naive expectation from a gas kinetic theory approach that the number density of mergers should be proportional to the number\ndensity of subhalo pairs, i.e Rmerge \u221d n2sub . This discrepancy\nindicates that most of the satellite-satellite mergers do not\noccur because of random encounters between two unrelated\nsubstructures. We investigate this idea further in the following subsection, where we look back at the orbits of the\nsubhaloes that merge.\n4.2.2\n\nOrbits of merging satellites\n\nFig. 7 shows the distribution function of the separation angle\n\u03b8 between the progenitors of subhaloes involved in a merger.\nThe angle is measured from the centre of the host halo in\nwhich the merger is going to take place, at the last snapshot\nHowever, in practice, the dominant effect is the high abundance\nof low mass host haloes in which only massive substructures can\nbe resolved. As a result, the distribution of all subhaloes in the\nMS resembles the distribution of the most massive substructures.\n\nFigure 8. Three representative examples extracted from the\nMS for each of the two most common configurations between\ntwo satellite subhaloes that merge. The plots show the relative\npositions of the host and satellite halos in a time sequence, with\ntime increasing from left to right. The black circles correspond to\nthe halo that hosts the merger, while red and green circles show\nthe positions of the satellites involved in the merger. The circles'\nradii are proportional to the half mass radius of each substructure.\nClass 1: in this case the satellites were part of two separate haloes\n(red and green circles) before they were accreted into a larger halo\n(black circles). Class 2: both substructures belonged to the same\nhalo before it was accreted into the larger structure which hosts\nthe merger.\n\nin which both subhaloes were identified outside the halo that\nlater hosts the satellite-satellite merger. It thus represents\nthe angle between the subhaloes at the time they fall into\nthe host halo. The first point to note is that the distribution\nseems to be universal in the sense that it is roughly independent of the mass of the host halo. (We have also checked that\nit is roughly independent of redshift.) However, the most important feature is that the distribution is clearly dominated\nby small separation angles. About 65% of the mergers occur\nbetween subhaloes that were separated by less than 30 deg at\nthe moment of accretion. (This percentage increases to 73%\nfor an angle of 43 deg.) This demonstrates that the mergers\nare mostly between two or more systems that were already\ndynamically associated before they fell into the larger system. If the gas kinetic theory approach of Makino & Hut\n(1997) applied to this case, then the mergers would be be-\n\n\fThe Fate of Substructures in Dark Matter Haloes\ntween subhaloes on random orbits, and we would expect\na more uniform distribution in cos \u03b8. (It would not be completely uniform since the subhalo population is not isotropic,\nas shown in Fig. 4.)\nMore information about the orbits of merging subhaloes is given in Fig. 8, where we display three representative examples of the two most common configurations of a\nsatellite-satellite merger. These examples correspond to real\nsequences found in the MS. The plot tracks the position\nof substructures up to the snapshot of the merger (which\nhappens at the rightmost position), starting on the left, 9\nsnapshots earlier. We show as a black circle the halo that\nhosts the satellite-satellite merger and, as green and red circles, the progenitors of the subhaloes involved in the merger.\nThe red circle at the end of the sequence indicates the subhalo resulting from the merger. The radii of the circles are\nproportional to the half-mass radius of the subhalo.\nThe two most common configurations are as follows:\nClass 1: the progenitors of the subhaloes correspond to two\nseparate haloes which were accreted at approximately the\nsame time. Note that, as shown by Fig. 7, these haloes were\nspatially close at the time of accretion. Class 2: the merger\noccurs between two substructures that were part of the same\nhalo before it fell into the host halo. In other words, there\nis a halo that contains two substructures which survived\nthe accretion and subsequently merged. The merger event\nwhich started outside the main halo is completed inside it,\nas a subhalo-subhalo merger.\nMost subhalo mergers occur between substructures that\nare accreted close together both in time and location. Generally, they were already part of the same system before it\nwas accreted into a larger one, or were part of two separate\nhaloes that were about to merge. This is probably a requisite\nfor a subhalo merger to occur. The potential generated by\nthe other satellite has to be at least comparable to that of\nthe main halo. Hence, satellites accreted at different angles\nwill follow relatively independent dynamical histories and\nare much less likely to merge.\n\nFigure 9. Contour plot showing the logarithm of the number\nof satellite-satellite mergers as a function of the masses of the\nmerging subhaloes at z = 0.5. The x-axis indicates the mass of the\nsmaller subhalo while the y-axis indicates the mass of the larger\nsubhalo. The different panels show the results for host haloes of\ndifferent masses as indicated on each panel. The numbers in the\nbottom right show the number of mergers displayed in each panel.\nThe vertical dashed lines indicate the 200 particle limit and the\ndiagonal lines correspond to a 1:1 ratios between the masses of\nthe two subhaloes. The horizontal lines show the mass limit on\nthe more massive participant imposed by the choice of mass bin.\n\n4.3\n4.2.3\n\nThe mass ratio of subhalo mergers\n\nIn Fig. 9, we inspect the relative masses of the satellite subhaloes which merge. The x-axis indicates the mass of the\nsmaller subhalo and the y-axis shows the mass of the larger\none. Interestingly, we find that, for the range of host halo\nmasses plotted, the most common merger is that between\ntwo substructures of dissimilar masses, Msub,1 \u223c 10\u00d7Msub,2 .\nNote that this trend is contrary to the naive expectation\nwhereby the mergers are simply proportional to the abundance of substructures, in which case the maxima would\nbe located around the line Msub,1 = Msub,2 . However, it\nis roughly consistent with the idea that substructure mergers happen between two structures that were part of the\nsame halo before accretion. For instance, if the most common merger happens between the main subhalo and its most\nmassive substructure, then, as we have seen, we would expect to find a mass ratio of 1:25 (see Fig. 2) and the maxima\nof Fig. 9 along Msub,1 \u223c 10 \u00d7 Msub,2\n\n11\n\nMerger probability since accretion\n\nFinally, in Fig. 10 we plot the fraction of subhaloes at a\ngiven redshift that have had a merger with another satellite\nsubhalo since accretion into the current host halo. The top\npanels show mergers between satellites with a mass ratio\ngreater than 0.03, i.e. in which the less massive subhalo has,\nat least, 3% of the mass of the larger one. In the bottom\npanels we consider mergers between subhaloes with more\nsimilar masses: the minimum mass ratio is 0.3.\nThe fraction of current subhaloes which have experienced a merger in the past is a quantity strongly affected by\nresolution. For instance, in the history of a subhalo resolved\nwith 1000 particles, because of our 200 particle mass cut on\nsubhaloes, we can only record mergers with other subhaloes\nwhich account for at least one fifth of the final subhalo mass.\nOn the other hand, if our current subhalo is resolved with\n10000 particles, then a much wider range of merger mass\nratios can be tracked. These considerations are further complicated by the fact that we expect the measured mass of\n\n\f12\n\nAngulo et al.\n\nFigure 10. The fraction of substructures that have experienced a merger with another substructure since the time of accretion into the\ncurrent host halo. The x-axis gives the subhalo mass at the redshift shown, while the ratio M2 /M1 on the y-axis is for the two progenitors\nof the subhalo at the time they merged. The results from the MS are shown by solid lines while the results from the HS are shown by\ndashed lines. The coloured lines represent the data from haloes of different masses, as indicated by the key. The two rows correspond to\ndifferent mass ratios between the subhalo progenitors involved in the merger: Msub,2 > 0.03 Msub,1 (top row) and Msub,2 > 0.3 Msub,1\n(bottom row) where Msub,2 refers to the larger satellite involved in the merger. The three panels display the results for substructures\nidentified at redshifts z = 1, 0.5 and 0 respectively.\n\na subhalo to be less than the mass of its progenitors at infall, due to tidal disruption and stripping; hence an object\nthat is below our 200 particle limit at a particular redshift\ncould have been above this mass cut when it experienced\nthe subhalo-subhalo merger.\n\nTo improve statistics, whilst at the same time attempting to avoid building a resolution dependence into our results, we relax the particle number constraint on subhaloes\nfor this exercise. At the redshift a subhalo is identified (i.e.\nthe redshift plotted in Fig. 10), we consider subhaloes of\n30 particles or more. At the redshift of the subhalo merger,\nthe progenitors must both have 50 particles or more to be\ncounted.\n\nFig. 10 shows that the probability of a subhalo merger is\nconstant for subhaloes of different mass. About 1% percent\nof subhaloes have had a merger with another subhalo with\na mass ratio > 0.3. For a mass ratio > 0.03, this fraction\nincreases to \u223c 10%. We also note that these fractions show\na weak decrease with redshift.\n\n5\n\nSUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have used the Millennium simulation, together with a\nsimulation which has 10 times better resolution but about\n100 times smaller volume, to investigate the general properties of the substructures within dark matter haloes, including their merger rates. Our main findings can be summarized\nas follows:\nIn agreement with previous studies, we find that the\nmass function of low and intermediate mass subhaloes follows roughly a power-law. However, we also find an exponential cut-off in the mass function at high subhalo masses.\nWe have provided an expression, Eq. 2, that describes this\nbehaviour accurately. We also detect a small but systematic dependence of the number of subhaloes on the mass\nof the host halo. On average, at a given fractional mass,\nMsub /Mhost , high mass haloes contain more low and intermediate mass substructures than their less massive counterparts. In contrast, we find evidence that high mass haloes\ncontain fewer high mass subhaloes than do low mass haloes.\nIn spite of this, the fractional mass of the first, second and\nthird most massive substructures is insensitive to the mass\nof the host halo and of the redshift.\nWe confirm that the radial and angular distributions\n\n\fThe Fate of Substructures in Dark Matter Haloes\nof subhaloes are roughly independent of the host halo mass\nand redshift. However, we find that the radial distribution\ndoes depend on the subhalo mass relative to that of the host\nhalo. The subhalo distribution is less concentrated than the\ndark matter, but the radial distribution of low mass subhaloes tends to be more concentrated than that of high\nmass subhaloes. This difference can be understood as resulting from the different efficiency of dynamical friction in\nsubhaloes of different mass. On the other hand, these discrepancies between the radial distributions of low and high\nmass subhaloes disappear in the outer parts of the halo, as\nseen in recent ultra-high resolution simulations of galactic\nhalos (Springel et al. 2008).\nThe angular distribution of subhaloes tends to be\naligned perpendicular to the spin axis of the host halo. This\nis probably due to an anisotropic mass accretion - mergers happen preferentially along filaments. The alignment is\nstrong for the most massive subhaloes, but is much weaker\nfor low mass substructures since, on average, they have spent\na few orbital times inside the halo which would randomize\ntheir orientation.\nWe have found that satellite-satellite mergers do occur.\nOver most of the mass range resolved in our simulations,\nthey are subdominant when compared with mergers between\nsatellites and the central subhalo. However, we see some\nindication that satellite-satellite mergers are equally likely\nto satellite-central mergers for the lowest mass subhaloes\n(Msub /Mhost < 10\u22123 ). As for many other subhalo properties,\nthe merger rates appear to be a function of the fractional\nsubhalo mass only, and are independent of the particular\nhost or subhalo mass.\nThe radial distribution of satellite-satellite subhalo\nmergers closely follows the radial distribution of subhaloes.\nThis implies that most of the subhalo mergers happen in the\nouter layers of the halo. For the most part, these mergers\ninvolve subhaloes that are already dynamically associated\nbefore accretion into the main halo, i.e. they were either\npart of the same halo, or of two separate haloes that were\naccreted at similar times and locations. At every redshift,\nmost of these subhaloes which subsequently merged were\ncloser together than 30 deg as seen from the centre of the\nhalo that hosts the merger, at the time they fell in.\nFinally, we find that a small fraction of the high-mass\nsubhaloes has experienced a merger with another subhalo\nsince accretion into the current host halo. The values depend\non the mass ratio of the merger, but vary from a few percent\nfor mass ratios greater than 0.3 to \u223c 10% for mass ratios\ngreater than 0.03.\nIn spite of using some of the largest simulations to date,\nour results could still be affected to some extent by numerical resolution. Due to the rarity of the events we are trying to\nstudy, it is difficult to find a range of substructure and host\nhalo masses where we have, at the same time, (i) enough particles to resolve substructures well, (ii) enough haloes to distinguish real trends from cosmic variance, and (iii) enough\nsubhaloes to establish their properties and dynamics. Fortunately, as we have shown, many properties can be described\nas a function of only the fractional subhalo mass. In these\ncases we are observing the same system resolved with many\ndifferent numbers of particles, so it is reassuring that we find\nthe same trends for different host halo masses. This gives us\nconfidence that these results are robust. On the other hand,\n\n13\n\nquantities which scale with halo mass are much less reliable\nand could still be affected by resolution effects. Much larger\nsimulations, currently beyond reach, will be needed to check\nthem.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nWe are grateful to Adrian Jenkins and John Helly for providing us with the high resolution simulation and merger\ntrees used in this paper.

For instance, two-body encounters, particle heating, or force softening could easily dilute substructures that\nare not resolved with enough particles (Moore et al. 1996).\n\nFigure 11. The mean number of satellite-central subhalo mergers per subhalo and per unit of time as a function of the subhalo\nmass. The solid lines show the results from the MS while the\ndashed lines show the result from the HS. The coloured lines represent the results from haloes of different mass, as indicated by\nthe legend. Note that we display results from subhaloes with 20\nparticles or more. The upturn in Nm for low mass subhaloes is\ndue to the inclusion of subhaloes resolved with fewer than 200\nparticles. Once the N > 200 criterion is applied, the upturn disappears as shown in Fig 5.\n\nThese problems translate into an overestimation of the number of satellite-central subhalo mergers in each timestep.\nSuch a feature is clear in Fig. 11, which is similar to\nFig. 5, but for satellite-central mergers only and including\nsubhaloes with less than 200 particles. For these objects,\nwe can see a strong disagreement between the merger rate\nof substructures in the simulations with different resolution\nwhich is manifest as an upturn in the curves. However, the\nupturn disappears for subhaloes with N > 200 which is the\nlimit set in this paper.\nAn overestimation of the destruction rate also has implications for other quantities such as the abundance and radial\ndistribution of subhaloes. For instance, the subhalo mass\nfunction shows a cut-off at low masses compared with the\nexpected power-law behaviour when we include subhaloes\nresolved with fewer than \u223c 50 particles. (This quantity is\nless affected since most of the subhaloes are in the outer\nlayers of the halo.) On the other hand, the inner part of the\nradial distribution is more sensitive to these effects. Once\nsubhaloes with fewer than 200 particles are included in Fig. 3\nthe distribution becomes less centrally concentrated.\nOur convergence study indicates that 200 particles is\nthe limit below which results are unduly affected by resolution. This is why we have adopted this minimum particle\ncount throughout this chapter, except when otherwise stated\nexplicitly. This choice should minimize finite-resolution effects.\n\n\f"}
