In 1998, Winfree [18] introduced the (abstract)\nTile Assembly Model (TAM) - an extension of Wang tiling [16, 17], and a mathematical model\nof the DNA self-assembly pioneered by Seeman et. al. [14]. In the TAM, the fundamental components are un-rotatable, but translatable \"tile types\" whose sides are labeled with glue \"colors\"\nand \"strengths.\" Two tiles that are placed next to each other interact if the glue colors on their\nabutting sides match, and they bind if the strength on their abutting sides matches, and is at least\na certain \"temperature.\" Rothemund and Winfree [13, 12] later refined the model, and Lathrop et.\nal. [10] gave a treatment of the TAM in which equal status is bestowed upon the self-assembly of\ninfinite and finite structures. There are also several generalizations [2, 11, 8] of the TAM.\nDespite its deliberate over-simplification, the TAM is a computationally and geometrically expressive model. For instance, Winfree [18] proved that the TAM is computationally universal, and\nthus can be directed algorithmically. Winfree [18] also exhibited a seven-tile-type self-assembly\nsystem, directed by a clever XOR-like algorithm, that \"paints\" a picture of a well-known shape,\nthe discrete Sierpinski triangle S, onto the first quadrant. Note that the underlying shapes of each\nof the previous results are actually infinite canvases that completely cover the first quadrant, onto\nwhich computationally interesting shapes are painted (i.e., full weak self-assembly). Moreover,\nLathrop et. al [9] recently gave a new characterization of the computably enumerable sets in terms\nof weak self-assembly using a \"ray construction.\" It is natural to ask the question: How expressive\nis the TAM with respect to the self-assembly of a particular, possibly infinite shape, and nothing\nelse (i.e., strict self-assembly)?\n\u2217\n\nThis research was supported in part by National Science Foundation Grants 0652569 and 0728806\n\n\fIn the case of strict self-assembly of finite shapes, the TAM certainly remains an interesting\nmodel, so long as the size (tile complexity) of the assembly system is required to be \"small\" relative\nto the shape that it ultimately produces. For instance, Rothemund and Winfree [13] proved that\nthere are small tile sets in which large squares self-assemble. Moreover, Soloveichik and Winfree [15]\nestablished the remarkable fact that, if one is not concerned with the scale of an \"algorithmically\ndescribable\" finite shape, then there is always a small tile set in which the shape self-assembles.\nNote that if the tile complexity of an assembly system is unbounded, then every finite shape trivially\n(but perhaps not feasibly) self-assembles.\nWhen the tile complexity of an assembly system is unbounded (yet finite), only infinite shapes\nare of interest. In the case of strict self-assembly of infinite shapes, the power of the TAM has only\nrecently been investigated. Lathrop et. al. [10] established that self-similar tree shapes do not\nstrictly self-assemble in the TAM given any finite number of tile types. A \"fiber construction\" is\nalso given in [10], which strictly self-assembles a non-trivial fractal structure.\nIn this paper, we search for (1) absolute limitations of the TAM, with respect to the strict\nself-assembly of shapes, and (2) techniques that allow one to \"work around\" such limitations.\nSpecifically, we investigate the strict self-assembly of fractal shapes in the TAM. We prove three\nmain results: two negative and one positive. Our first negative (i.e., impossibility) result says that\nno self-similar fractal fully weakly self-assembles in the TAM (at temperature 1). In our second\nimpossibility result, we exhibit a class of discrete self-similar fractals, to which the standard discrete\nSierpinski triangle belongs, that do not strictly self-assemble in the TAM (at any temperature).\nFinally, in our positive result, we use simple modified counters to extend the fiber construction\nfrom Lathrop et. al. [10] to a particular class of discrete self-similar fractals.\n\n2\n2.1\n\nPreliminaries\nNotation and Terminology\n\nWe work in the discrete Euclidean plane Z2 = Z \u00d7 Z. We write U2 for the set of all unit vectors, i.e.,\nvectors of length 1, in Z2 . We regard the four elements of U2 as (names of the cardinal) directions\nin Z2 .\nWe write [X]2 for the set of all 2-element subsets of a set X. All graphs here are undirected\ngraphs, i.e., ordered pairs G = (V, E), where V is the set of vertices and E \u2286 [V ]2 is the set of\nedges. A cut of a graph G = (V, E) is a partition C = (C0 , C1 ) of V into two nonempty, disjoint\nsubsets C0 and C1 .\nA binding function on a graph G = (V, E) is a function \u03b2 : E \u2192 N. (Intuitively, if {u, v} \u2208 E,\nthen \u03b2 ({u, v}) is the strength with which u is bound to v by {u, v} according to \u03b2. If \u03b2 is a binding\nfunction on a graph G = (V, E) and C = (C0 , C1 ) is a cut of G, then the binding strength of \u03b2 on\nC is\n\u03b2C = {\u03b2(e) |e \u2208 E, e \u2229 C0 6= \u2205, and e \u2229 C1 6= \u2205 } .\nThe binding strength of \u03b2 on the graph G is then\n\u03b2(G) = min {\u03b2C |C is a cut of G } .\nA binding graph is an ordered triple G = (V, E, \u03b2), where (V, E) is a graph and \u03b2 is a binding\nfunction on (V, E). If \u03c4 \u2208 N, then a binding graph G = (V, E, \u03b2) is \u03c4 -stable if \u03b2(V, E) \u2265 \u03c4 .\n\n\fA grid graph is a graph G = (V, E) in which V \u2286 Z2 and every edge {m,\n~ ~n} \u2208 E has the\n#\n2\nproperty that m\n~ \u2212 ~n \u2208 U2 . The full grid graph on a set V \u2286 Z is the graph GV = (V, E) in which\nE contains every {m,\n~ ~n} \u2208 [V ]2 such that m\n~ \u2212 ~n \u2208 U2 .\nWe say that f is a partial function from a set X to a set Y , and we write f : X 99K Y , if\nf : D \u2192 Y for some set D \u2286 X. In this case, D is the domain of f , and we write D = dom f .\nAll logarithms here are base-2.\n\n2.2\n\nThe Tile Assembly Model\n\nWe review the basic ideas of the Tile Assembly Model. Our development largely follows that of\n[13, 12], but some of our terminology and notation are specifically tailored to our objectives. In\nparticular, our version of the model only uses nonnegative \"glue strengths\", and it bestows equal\nstatus on finite and infinite assemblies. We emphasize that the results in this section have been\nknown for years, e.g., they appear, with proofs, in [12].\nDefinition. A tile type over an alphabet \u03a3 is a function t : U2 \u2192 \u03a3\u2217 \u00d7 N. We write t = (colt , strt ),\nwhere colt : U2 \u2192 \u03a3\u2217 , and strt : U2 \u2192 N are defined by t(~u) = (colt (~u), strt (~u)) for all ~u \u2208 U2 .\nIntuitively, a tile of type t is a unit square. It can be translated but not rotated, so it has a\nwell-defined \"side ~u \" for each ~u \u2208 U2 . Each side ~u of the tile is covered with a \"glue\" of color\ncolt (~u) and strength strt (~u). If tiles of types t and t\u2032 are placed with their centers at m\n~ and m\n~ + ~u,\nrespectively, where m\n~ \u2208 Z2 and ~u \u2208 U2 , then they will bind with strength strt (~u) * [[t(~u) = t\u2032 (\u2212~u)]]\nwhere [[\u03c6]] is the Boolean value of the statement \u03c6. Note that this binding strength is 0 unless the\nadjoining sides have glues of both the same color and the same strength.\nFor the remainder of this section, unless otherwise specified, T is an arbitrary set of tile types,\nand \u03c4 \u2208 N is the \"temperature.\"\nDefinition. A T-configuration is a partial function \u03b1 : Z2 99K T .\nIntuitively, a configuration is an assignment \u03b1 in which a tile of type \u03b1(m)\n~ has been placed\n(with its center) at each point m\n~ \u2208 dom \u03b1. The following data structure characterizes how these\ntiles are bound to one another.\nDefinition. The binding graph of a T -configuration \u03b1 : Z2 99K T is the binding graph G\u03b1 =\n(V, E, \u03b2), where (V, E) is the grid graph given by\nV = dom \u03b1,\nn\no\nE = {m,\n~ ~n} \u2208 [V ]2 m\n~ \u2212 ~n \u2208 Un , col\u03b1(m)\n(~\nn\n\u2212\nm)\n~\n=\ncol\n(\nm\n~\n\u2212\n~\nn\n)\n,\nand\nstr\n(~\nn\n\u2212\nm)\n~\n>\n0\n,\n~\n\u03b1(~\nn)\n\u03b1(m)\n~\nand the binding function \u03b2 : E \u2192 Z+ is given by\n\u03b2 ({m,\n~ ~n}) = str\u03b1(m)\nn \u2212 m)\n~\n~ (~\nfor all {m,\n~ ~n} \u2208 E.\nDefinition.\n1. A T -configuration \u03b1 is \u03c4 -stable if its binding graph G\u03b1 is \u03c4 -stable.\n\n\f2. A \u03c4 -T -assembly is a T -configuration that is \u03c4 -stable. We write A\u03c4T for the set of all \u03c4 -T assemblies.\nDefinition. Let \u03b1 and \u03b1\u2032 be T -configurations.\n1. \u03b1 is a subconfiguration of \u03b1\u2032 , and we write \u03b1 \u2291 \u03b1\u2032 , if dom \u03b1 \u2286 dom \u03b1\u2032 and, for all m\n~ \u2208 dom \u03b1,\n\u03b1(m)\n~ = \u03b1\u2032 (m).\n~\n2. \u03b1\u2032 is a single-tile extension of \u03b1 if \u03b1 \u2291 \u03b1\u2032 and dom \u03b1\u2032 \u2212 dom \u03b1 is a singleton set. In this case,\nwe write \u03b1\u2032 = \u03b1 + (m\n~ 7\u2192 t), where {m}\n~ = dom \u03b1\u2032 \u2212 dom \u03b1 and t = \u03b1\u2032 (m).\n~\nNote that the expression \u03b1 + (m\n~ 7\u2192 t) is only defined when m\n~ \u2208 Z2 \u2212 dom \u03b1.\nWe next define the \"\u03c4 -t-frontier\" of a \u03c4 -T -assembly \u03b1 to be the set of all positions at which a\ntile of type t can be \"\u03c4 -stably added\" to the assembly \u03b1.\nDefinition. Let \u03b1 \u2208 A\u03c4T .\n1. For each t \u2208 T , the \u03c4 -t-frontier of \u03b1 is the set\n\uf8f1\n\uf8fc\n\uf8f2\n\uf8fd\nX\n\u2202t\u03c4 \u03b1 = m\n~ \u2208 Z2 \u2212 dom \u03b1\nstrt (~u) * [[\u03b1(m\n~ + ~u)(\u2212~u) = t(~u)]] \u2265 \u03c4 .\n\uf8f3\n\uf8fe\nu\u2208U2\n~\n\n2. The \u03c4 -frontier of \u03b1 is the set\n\n\u2202\u03c4 \u03b1 =\n\n[\n\n\u2202t\u03c4 \u03b1.\n\nt\u2208T\n\nThe following lemma shows that the definition of \u2202t\u03c4 \u03b1 achieves the desired effect.\nLemma 1. Let \u03b1 \u2208 A\u03c4T , m\n~ \u2208 Z2 \u2212 dom \u03b1, and t \u2208 T . Then \u03b1 + (m\n~ 7\u2192 t) \u2208 A\u03c4T if and only if\nm\n~ \u2208 \u2202t\u03c4 \u03b1.\n1\n\n1\n\nNotation. We write \u03b1 \u2212\u2212\u2192 \u03b1\u2032 (or, when \u03c4 and T are clear from context, \u03b1 \u2212\u2192 \u03b1\u2032 ) to indicate\n\u03c4,T\n\nthat \u03b1, \u03b1\u2032 \u2208 A\u03c4T and \u03b1\u2032 is a single-tile extension of \u03b1.\nIn general, self-assembly occurs with tiles adsorbing nondeterministically and asynchronously\nto a growing assembly. We now define assembly sequences, which are particular \"execution traces\"\nof how this might occur.\nDefinition. A \u03c4 -T -assembly sequence is a sequence \u03b1\n~ = (\u03b1i | 0 \u2264 i < k) in A\u03c4T , where k \u2208 Z+ \u222a{\u221e}\n1\n\nand, for each i with 1 \u2264 i + 1 < k, \u03b1i \u2212\u2212\u2192 \u03b1i+1 .\n\u03c4,T\n\nNote that assembly sequences may be finite or infinite in length. Note also that, in any \u03c4 -T assembly sequence \u03b1\n~ = (\u03b1i | 0 \u2264 i < k), we have \u03b1i \u2291 \u03b1j for all 0 \u2264 i \u2264 j < k.\nDefinition. The result of a \u03c4 -T -assembly sequence\n\u03b1\n~ = (\u03b1i | 0 \u2264 i < k) is the unique T S\nconfiguration \u03b1 = res(~\n\u03b1) satisfying dom \u03b1 = 0\u2264i<k dom \u03b1i and \u03b1i \u2291 \u03b1 for each 0 \u2264 i < k.\nIt is clear that res(~\n\u03b1) \u2208 A\u03c4T for every \u03c4 -T -assembly sequence \u03b1\n~.\n\n\fDefinition. Let \u03b1, \u03b1\u2032 \u2208 A\u03c4T .\n1. A \u03c4 -T -assembly sequence from \u03b1 to \u03b1\u2032 is a \u03c4 -T -assembly sequence \u03b1\n~ = (\u03b1i | 0 \u2264 i < k) such\nthat \u03b10 = \u03b1 and res(~\n\u03b1) = \u03b1\u2032 .\n2. We write \u03b1 \u2212\u2212\u2192 \u03b1\u2032 (or, when \u03c4 and T are clear from context, \u03b1 \u2212\u2192 \u03b1\u2032 ) to indicate that there\n\u03c4,T\n\nexists a \u03c4 -T -assembly sequence from \u03b1 to \u03b1\u2032 .\nDefinition. An assembly \u03b1 \u2208 A\u03c4T is terminal if and only if \u2202 \u03c4 \u03b1 = \u2205.\nWe now define tile assembly systems.\nDefinition.\n1. A generalized tile assembly system (GTAS) is an ordered triple\nT = (T, \u03c3, \u03c4 ),\nwhere T is a set of tile types, \u03c3 \u2208 A\u03c4T is the seed assembly, and \u03c4 \u2208 N is the temperature.\n2. A tile assembly system (TAS) is a GTAS T = (T, \u03c3, \u03c4 ) in which the sets T and dom \u03c3 are\nfinite.\nIntuitively, a \"run\" of a GTAS T = (T, \u03c3, \u03c4 ) is any \u03c4 -T -assembly sequence \u03b1\n~ = (\u03b1i | 0 \u2264 i < k)\nthat begins with \u03b10 = \u03c3. Accordingly, we define the following sets.\nDefinition. Let T = (T, \u03c3, \u03c4 ) be a GTAS.\n1. The set of assemblies produced by T is\n\u001b\n\u001a\n\u03c4\nA[T ] = \u03b1 \u2208 AT \u03c3 \u2212\u2212\u2192 \u03b1 .\n\u03c4,T\n\n2. The set of terminal assemblies produced by T is\nA\u0003[T ] = { \u03b1 \u2208 A[T ]| \u03b1 is terminal} .\nDefinition. A GTAS T = (T, \u03c3, \u03c4 ) is directed if |A\u0003[T ]| = 1.\nWe are using the terminology of the mathematical theory of relations here. The reader is\ncautioned that the term \"directed\" has also been used for a different, more specialized notion in\nself-assembly [?].\nIn the present paper, we are primarily interested in the self-assembly of sets.\nDefinition. Let T = (T, \u03c3, \u03c4 ) be a GTAS, and let X \u2286 Z2 .\n1. The set X weakly self-assembles in T if there is a set B \u2286 T such that, for all \u03b1 \u2208 A\u0003[T ],\n\u03b1\u22121 (B) = X.\n2. The set X fully weakly self-assembles in T if X and Z2 \u2212 X both weakly self-assemble.\n\n\f3. The set X strictly self-assembles in T if, for all \u03b1 \u2208 A\u0003[T ], dom \u03b1 = X.\nIntuitively, a set X weakly self-assembles in T if there is a designated set B of \"black\" tile types\nsuch that every terminal assembly of T \"paints the set X - and only the set X - black\". Moreover,\na set fully weakly self-assembles in T if every terminal assembly of T tiles the entire plane on top\nof which X is \"painted.\" In contrast, a set X strictly self-assembles in T if every terminal assembly\nof T has tiles on the set X and only on the set X. Clearly, every set that strictly self-assembles in\na GTAS T also weakly self-assembles in T .\nWe now have the machinery to say what it means for a set in the discrete Euclidean plane to\nself-assemble in either the fully weak, weak or the strict sense.\nDefinition. Let X \u2286 Z2 .\n1. The set X weakly self-assembles if there is a TAS T such that X weakly self-assembles in T .\n2. The set X fully weakly self-assembles if there is a TAS T such that X fully weakly selfassembles in T .\n3. The set X strictly self-assembles if there is a TAS T such that X strictly self-assembles in T .\nNote that T is required to be a TAS, i.e., finite, in all three parts of the above definition.\n\n2.3\n\nLocal Determinism\n\nThe proof of our construction uses the local determinism method of Soloveichik and Winfree [15],\nwhich we now review.\nNotation.

Let 1 < c \u2208 N, and X ( N2 (we do not consider N2 to be a self-similar fractal). We\nsay that X is a c-discrete self-similar fractal, if there is a set {(i, i) | i \u2208 {0, . . . , c \u2212 1}} =\n6 V \u2286\n{0, . . . , c \u2212 1} \u00d7 {0, . . . , c \u2212 1} such that\nX=\n\n\u221e\n[\n\nXi ,\n\ni=0\n\nith\n\n\u0001\nwhere Xi is the\nstage satisfying X0 = {(0, 0)}, and Xi+1 = Xi \u222a Xi + ci V . In this case, we\nsay that V generates X. X is a discrete self-similar fractal if it is a c-discrete self-similar fractal\nfor some c \u2208 N.\nIn this paper, we are concerned with the following class of self-similar fractals.\nDefinition. A nice discrete self-similar fractal is a discrete self-similar fractal such that ({0, . . . , c\u2212\n1} \u00d7 {0}) \u222a ({0} \u00d7 {0, . . . , c \u2212 1}) \u2286 V , and G#\nV is connected.\n\n\f(a) Nice\n\n(b) Non-nice\n\nFigure 1: The first stages of discrete self-similar fractals. The fractals in (a) are nice, whereas (b) shows\ntwo non-nice fractals.\n\n2.5\n\nZeta-Dimension\n\nThe most commonly used dimension for discrete fractals is zeta-dimension, which we use in this\npaper. The discrete-continuous correspondence mentioned in the introduction preserves dimension\nsomewhat generally. Thus, for example, the zeta-dimension of the discrete Sierpinski triangle is\nthe same as the Hausdorff dimension of the continuous Sierpinski triangle.\nZeta-dimension has been re-discovered several times by researchers in various fields over the past\nfew decades, but its origins actually lie in Euler's (real-valued predecessor of the Riemann) zetafunction [6] P\nand Dirichlet series. For each set A \u2286 Z2 , define the A-zeta-function \u03b6A : [0, \u221e) \u2192 [0, \u221e]\nby \u03b6A (s) = (0,0)6=(m,n)\u2208A (|m| + |n|)\u2212s for all s \u2208 [0, \u221e). Then the zeta-dimension of A is\nDim\u03b6 (A) = inf{s | \u03b6A (s) < \u221e}.\n\nIt is clear that 0 \u2264 Dim\u03b6 (A) \u2264 2 for all A \u2286 Z2 . It is also easy to see (and was proven by Cahen\nin 1894; see also [3, 7]) that zeta-dimension admits the \"entropy characterization\"\nDim\u03b6 (A) = lim sup\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nlog |A\u2264n |\n,\nlog n\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere A\u2264n = {(k, l) \u2208 A | |k| + |l| \u2264 n}. Various properties of zeta-dimension, along with extensive\nhistorical citations, appear in the recent paper [5], but our technical arguments here can be followed\nwithout reference to this material. We use the fact, verifiable by routine calculation, that (2.1) can\nbe transformed by changes of variable up to exponential, e.g.,\nDim\u03b6 (A) = lim sup\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nlog |A[0,2n ]\u2229N |\nn\n\nalso holds.\n\n3\n\nImpossibility Results\n\nIn this section, we explore the theoretical limitations of the Tile Assembly Model with respect to\nthe self-assembly of fractal shapes. First, we establish that no discrete self-similar fractal fully\nweakly self-assembles at temperature \u03c4 = 1. Second, we exhibit a class C of discrete self-similar\nfractals, and prove that if F \u2208 C, then F does not strictly self-assemble in the TAM.\nDefinition. (Lathrop et. al. [10]) Let G = (V, E) be a graph, and let D \u2286 V . For each r \u2208 V , the\nD-r-rooted subgraph of G is the graph GD,r = (VD,r , ED,r ), where\nVD,r = {v \u2208 V | every simple path from v to (any vertex in) D in G goes through r }\nand ED,r = E \u2229 [VD,r ]2 . B is a D-subgraph of G if it is a D-r-rooted subgraph of G for some r \u2208 V .\n\n\fDefinition. Let G = (V, E) be a graph. Fix a set D \u2286 V , and let r, r \u2032 \u2208 V .\n1. (Adleman et. al. [1]) GD,r is isomorphic to GD,r\u2032 , and we write GD,r \u223c GD,r\u2032 if there exists\na vector ~a \u2208 Z2 such that VD,r = VD,r\u2032 + ~a.\n2. We say that GD,r is unique if, for all r \u2032 \u2208 V , GD,r \u223c GD,r\u2032 \u21d2 r = r \u2032 .\nWe will use the following technical result to prove that no self-similar fractal weakly selfassembles at temperature \u03c4 = 1.\nLemma 2. (Adleman et. al. [1]) Let X ( N2 such that G#\nX is a finite tree, and assume that\nX strictly self-assembles in the TAS T = (T, \u03c3, \u03c4 ). Let \u03b1 \u2208 A\u0003[T ]. If \u03b1 (~u) = \u03b1 (~v ), then the\nGdom \u03c3,~u \u223c Gdom \u03c3,~v .\nThe following construction says that if it is possible to self-assemble a finite path P at temperature 1 (not necessarily uniquely), then there is always a TAS TP in which P uniquely self-assembles\nat temperature 1.\nConstruction 1. Let T be a finite set of tile types, and \u03b1\n~ = (\u03b1i | 0 \u2264 i < k) be a 1-T -assembly\nsequence, with \u03b1 = res(~\n\u03b1), satisfying\n1. dom \u03b10 = {(0, 0)}, and\n2. G#\n\u03b1 is a connected, finite path P .\nIt is clear that for all ~v \u2208 P , IN\u03b1~ (~v ) = OUT\u03b1~ (~v ) = 1. Now define, for each ~v \u2208 P , the (unique)\nvectors ~vin , ~vout , satisfying ~vin \u2208 IN\u03b1~ (~v ), and ~vout \u2208 OUT\u03b1~ (~v ).\nt~v , where for all ~u \u2208 U2 ,\n\u0001\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 col\u03b1(~v ) (~u) * \"in\", str\u03b1(~v) (~u) \u0001\nt~v (~u) =\ncol\u03b1(~v ) (~u) * \"out\", str\u03b1(~v ) (~u)\n\uf8f3\n(\u03bb, 0)\n\nFor each ~v \u2208 P , define the tile type\nif ~v + ~u = ~vin\nif ~v + ~u = ~vout\notherwise.\n\nLet TP = { t~v | ~v \u2208 P }. Note that since P is finite, so too is TP . Now define the TAS TP =\n(TP , \u03c3P , 1), where for all ~v \u2208 N2 , \u03c3P is defined as\n\u001a\nt(0,0) if ~v = (0, 0)\n\u03c3P (~v ) =\n\u2191\notherwise.\nIt is routine to verify that TP is directed (i.e., P uniquely self-assembles in TP ).\nWe now have the machinery to prove our first impossibility result.\nTheorem 2. If F ( N2 is a discrete self-similar fractal, G#\nF is connected, and F fully weakly\nself-assembles in the TAS TF = (T, \u03c3, \u03c4 ), where \u03c3 consists of a single tile placed at the origin, then\n\u03c4 > 1.\nProof. Suppose that F is generated by the set V \u2286 {0, . . . c \u2212 1}2 , and assume for the sake of\nobtaining a contradiction that \u03c4 = 1. Let V \u2032 = {0, . . . c \u2212 1}2 \u2212 V . There are two cases to consider.\n\n\f#\nCase 1 If there exists a path P = h(x0 , y0 ), . . . , (xl\u22121 , yl\u22121 )i in G#\nV \u2032 , with GP connected, satisfying\neither of the following.\n\n1. (x0 , y0 ) \u2208 ({0} \u00d7 {0, . . . c \u2212 1}) and (xl\u22121 , yl\u22121 ) \u2208 ({c \u2212 1} \u00d7 {0, . . . c \u2212 1}).\n2. (x0 , y0 ) \u2208 ({0 . . . , c \u2212 1} \u00d7 {0}) and (xl\u22121 , yl\u22121 ) \u2208 ({0, . . . , c \u2212 1} \u00d7 {c \u2212 1}).\nWithout loss of generality, assume that P satisfies (1). First note that there exists ~a \u2208 V ,\nand there is no path from (0, 0) to ~a in G#\nV . Define, for all i \u2208 N, the points\n~ai = ci * ~a.\nSince F is infinite, it is possible to choose k \u2208 N large enough so that the path\nP = h(x0 , y0 ), (x1 , y1 ), . . . (xk\u22121 , yk\u22121 )i\nsatisfies the following properties.\n1. (x0 , y0 ) = (0, 0),\n2. there exists l \u2208 N such that (xk\u22121 , yk\u22121 ) = ~al ,\n3. G#\nP is connected and simple (in fact a tree), and\n\u2032\n2\n\u2032\n4. there exists a sub-path P \u2032 \u2282 P , such that G#\nP \u2032 is connected, P \u2286 N \u2212F , and |P | > 12|T |\n(because F fully weakly self-assembles).\n\nSince \u03c4 = 1, there is an assembly sequence \u03b1\n~ = (\u03b1i | 0 \u2264 i < k), with \u03b1 = res(~\n\u03b1), satisfying\n\u03b10 = \u03c3, and dom \u03b1 = P . Then by Construction 1 there exists a 1-TP -assembly sequence\n\u03b1\n~ P = (\u03b1i | 0 \u2264 i < k), with result \u03b1P = res(~\n\u03b1P ) satisfying dom \u03b1P = P , and \u03b1P (xl\u22121 , yl\u22121 ) \u2208\nB. By (4), there exist ~s, ~t \u2208 P \u2032 such that \u03b1P (~s) = \u03b1P (~t), and ~s, ~t 6\u2208 F . Let Pdom \u03c3,~s and\nPdom \u03c3,~t be dom \u03c3-subgraphs of P . Then Lemma 2 tells us that Pdom \u03c3,~s \u223c Pdom \u03c3,~t, whence\nthere exists a location ~b \u2208 P \u2032 such that \u03b1P (~b) \u2208 B. This contradicts the definition of P .\nCase 2 If there is no such path in G#\nV \u2032 , then we proceed as follows. First note that there exists\n~a 6\u2208 V . It is clear that, for all i \u2208 N, ci * ~a + (1, 1) 6\u2208 F . For each i \u2208 N, define the point\n~ai = ci * ~a + (1, 1).\nSince F is infinite, it is possible to choose k \u2208 N large enough so that the path\nP = h(x0 , y0 ), (x1 , y1 ), . . . (xk\u22121 , yk\u22121 )i\nsatisfies the following properties.\n1. (x0 , y0 ) = (0, 0),\n2. there exists l \u2208 N such that (xk\u22121 , yk\u22121 ) = ~al (because F fully weakly self-assembles),\n3. G#\nP is connected and simple (in fact a tree), and\n4. for all ~u \u2208 U2 , min {i | i * ~u + ~al \u2208 F } > 12|T |.\n\n\fSince \u03c4 = 1, there is an assembly sequence \u03b1\n~ = (\u03b1i | 0 \u2264 i < k), with \u03b1 = res(~\n\u03b1), satisfying\n\u03b10 = \u03c3, and dom \u03b1 = P . Then by Construction 1 there exists a 1-TP -assembly sequence\n\u03b1\n~ P = (\u03b1i | 0 \u2264 i < k), with result \u03b1P = res(~\n\u03b1P ) satisfying dom \u03b1P = P . By (4), there\nexist ~s, ~t \u2208 P such that \u03b1P (~s) = \u03b1P (~t), and ~s, ~t 6\u2208 F . Let Pdom \u03c3,~s and Pdom \u03c3,~t be dom \u03c3subgraphs of P . Then Lemma 2 tells us that P can be extended to an infinite, periodic path\nP \u2032 consisting of all but finitely many non-black tiles (i.e., tiles that are placed on the points\nin N2 \u2212 F ). This contradicts the definition of F .\n\nNote that Theorem 3 says that even if one is allowed to place a tile at every location in the first\nquadrant, it is still impossible for self-similar fractals to weakly self-assemble at temperature 1.\nNext, we exhibit a class C of (non-tree) \"pinch-point\" discrete self-similar fractals that do not\nstrictly self-assemble. Before we do so, we establish the following lower bound.\nLemma 3. If X \u2286 Z2 strictly self-assembles\nin the TAS T = (T, \u03c3, \u03c4 ), where \u03c3 consists\nof a single\no\nn\n#\ntile placed at the origin, then |T | \u2265 B B is a unique dom \u03c3-subgraph of GX .\nProof. Assume the hypothesis,\nand let \u03b1 \u2208 A\u0003[T ]. For the purpose\no of obtaining a contradiction,\nn\n#\nsuppose that |T | < B B is a unique dom \u03c3-subgraph of GX . By the Pigeonhole Principle,\n\nthere exists points ~r, ~r\u2032 \u2208 X satisfying (1) \u03b1 (~r) = \u03b1 (~r\u2032 ), and (2) Gdom \u03c3,~r 6\u223c Gdom \u03c3,~r\u2032 . Let \u03c3 \u2032 be\nthe assembly with dom \u03c3 \u2032 = {~r\u2032 }, and for all ~u \u2208 U2 , define\n\u0001\n\u001a\ncol\u03b1(~r\u2032 ) (~u), str\u03b1(~r\u2032 ) (~u)\nif ~r\u2032 + ~u \u2208 Gdom \u03c3,~r\u2032\n\u2032 \u2032\n\u03c3 (~r )(~u) =\n(\u03bb, 0)\notherwise.\nLet \u03c3 \u2032\u2032 be the assembly with dom \u03c3 \u2032\u2032 = {~r\u2032\u2032 }, and for all ~u \u2208 U2 , define\n\u0001\n\u001a\ncol\u03b1(~r\u2032\u2032 ) (~u), str\u03b1(~r\u2032\u2032 ) (~u)\nif ~r\u2032\u2032 + ~u \u2208 Gdom \u03c3,~r\u2032\u2032\n\u2032 \u2032\u2032\n\u03c3 (~r )(~u) =\n(\u03bb, 0)\notherwise.\nThen T \u2032 = (T, \u03c3, \u03c4 ) is a TAS in which Gdom \u03c3,~r\u2032 strictly self-assembles, and T \u2032\u2032 = (T, \u03c3 \u2032\u2032 , \u03c4 ) is a TAS\nin which Gdom \u03c3,~r\u2032\u2032 strictly self-assembles. But this is impossible because \u03b1 (~r\u2032 ) = \u03b1 (~r\u2032\u2032 ) implies\nthat, for all ~u \u2208 U2 , \u03c3 \u2032 (~r\u2032 ) (~u) = \u03c3 \u2032\u2032 (~r\u2032\u2032 ) (~u).\nOur lower bound is not as tight as possible, but it applies to a general class of fractals. Our\nsecond impossibility result is the following.\nTheorem 3. If X ( N2 is a discrete self-similar fractal satisfying (1) {(0, 0), (0, c \u2212 1), (c \u2212 1, 0)} \u2286\nV , (2) V \u2229 ({1, . . . c \u2212 1} \u00d7 {c \u2212 1}) = \u2205, (3) V \u2229 ({c \u2212 1} \u00d7 {1, . . . , c \u2212 1}) = \u2205, and (4) G#\nV is\nconnected, then X does not strictly self-assemble in the Tile Assembly Model.\nProof.

The standard discrete Sierpinski triangle S does not strictly\nself-assemble in the Tile Assembly Model.\n\n4\n\nEvery Nice Self-Similar Fractal Has a Fibered Version\n\nIn this section, given a nice c-discrete self-similar fractal X ( N2 (generated by V ), we define its\nfibered counterpart X. Intuitively, X is nearly identical to X, but each successive stage of X is\nslightly thicker than the equivalent stage of X (see Figure 2 for an example). Our objective is to\ndefine sets F0 , F1 , . . . \u2286 Z2 , sets T0 , T1 , . . . \u2286 Z2 , and functions l, f, t : N \u2192 N with the following\nmeanings.\n1. Ti is the ith stage of our construction of the fibered version of X.\n2. Fi is the fiber associated with Ti . It is the smallest set whose union with Ti has a vertical left\nedge and a horizontal bottom edge, together with one additional layer added to these two\nnow-straight edges.\n3. l(i) is the length (number of tiles in) the left (or bottom) edge of Ti \u222a Fi .\n4. f (i) = |Fi |.\n5. t(i) = |Ti |.\nThese five entities are defined recursively by the equations\nT0 = X2 (the third stage of X),\n\b\n\u0001\n\b\n\u0001\nF0 = {\u22121} \u00d7 \u22121, . . . , c2 \u222a \u22121, . . . , c2 \u00d7 {\u22121} ,\n\nl(0) = c2 + 1, f (0) = 2c2 + 1, t(0) = (|V | + 1)2 ,\nTi+1 = Ti \u222a ((Ti \u222a Fi ) + l(i)V ) ,\n\nFi+1 = Fi \u222a ({\u2212i \u2212 2} \u00d7 {\u2212i \u2212 2, \u2212i \u2212 1, * * * , l(i + 1) \u2212 i \u2212 3})\n\u222a ({\u2212i \u2212 2, \u2212i \u2212 1, * * * , l(i + 1) \u2212 i \u2212 3} \u00d7 {\u2212i \u2212 2}) ,\nl(i + 1) = c * l(i) + 1,\nf (i + 1) = f (i) + c * l(i + 1) \u2212 1,\nt(i + 1) = |V |t(i) + f (i).\n\n\fT1\n\nT1\nT0\n\nT0\nl(1)\nF0\nF1\n\nFigure 2: Construction of the fibered Sierpinski carpet. The blue, and orange tiles represent (possibly\ntranslated copies of) F0 , and F1 , respectively. Note that this image should be viewed in color.\nFinally, we let\nX=\n\n\u221e\n[\n\nTi .\n\ni=0\n\nNote that the set Ti \u222a Fi is the union of an \"outer framework,\" with an \"internal structure.\"\nOne can view the outer framework of Ti \u222aFi as the union of a square Si (of size i+2), a rectangle Xi\n(of height i + 2 and width l(i) \u2212 (i + 2)), and a rectangle Yi (of width i + 2 and height l(i) \u2212 (i + 2)).\nMoreover, one can show that the internal structure of Ti \u222a Fi is simply the union of (appropriatelytranslated copies) of smaller and smaller Xi and Yi -rectangles.\nWe have the following \"similarity\" between X and X.\nLemma 4. If X ( N2 is a nice self-similar fractal, then Dim\u03b6 (X) = Dim\u03b6 (X).\nIn the next section we sketch a proof that the fibered version of every nice self-similar fractal\nstrictly self-assembles.\n\n5\n\nSketch of Main Construction\n\nOur second main theorem says that the fibered version of every nice self-similar fractal strictly\nself-assembles in the Tile Assembly Model (regardless of whether the latter strictly self-assembles).\nTheorem 4. For every nice self-similar fractal X \u2282 N2 , there is a directed TAS in which X strictly\nself-assembles.\nWe now give a brief sketch of our construction of the singly-seeded TAS TX = (XX , \u03c3, 2) in\nwhich X strictly self-assembles. The full construction is implemented in C++, and is available at\nthe following URL: http://www.cs.iastate.edu/~lnsa.\nThroughout our discussion, S~u , Y~u , and X~u refer to the square, the vertical rectangle and the\nhorizontal rectangle, respectively, that form the \"outer framework\" of the set ((Ti \u222a Fi ) + l(i) * ~u)\n(See the right-most image in Figure 4).\n\n\f5.1\n\nConstruction Phase 1\n\nHere, directed graphs are considered. Let X be a nice (c-discrete) self-similar fractal generated by\n#\nV . We first compute a directed spanning\n\u0001 tree B = (V, E) of GV using a breadth-first search, and\nR\nR\nthen compute the graph B = V, E , where\nE R = {(~v , ~u) | (~u, ~v ) \u2208 E and ~u 6= (0, 0)} \u222a {((0, 1), (0, c \u2212 1)), ((1, 0), (c \u2212 1), 0)}.\n\nFigure 3 depicts phase 1 of our construction for a particular nice self-similar fractal.\nNotation. For all ~0 6= ~u \u2208 V , ~uin is the unique location ~v satisfying (~u, ~v ) \u2208 E R .\n(0,1)\n\n(0,4)\n\n(1,4)\n\n(0,3)\n\n(2,3)\n\n(3,3)\n\n(0,2)\n\n(4,3)\n\n(4,2)\n(2,2)\n(4,1)\n\n(0,1)\n\n(0,0)\n\n(0,0)\n\n(1,0)\n\n(2,0)\n\n(3,0)\n\n(4,0)\n\n(1,0)\n\nFigure 3: Phase 1 of our construction. Notice the two special cases (right-most image) in which we define\n(0, 1)in and (1, 0)in .\n\n5.2\n\nConstruction Phase 2\n\nIn the second phase we construct, for each (0, 0) 6= ~u \u2208 V , a finite set of tile types T~u that\nself-assemble a particular subset of X. There are two cases to consider.\nCase 1 In the first case, we generate, for each ~u \u2208 V \u2212 {(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0)}, three sets of tile\ntypes TS~u , TX~u , and TY~u that, when combined together, and assuming the presence of\n((Ti \u222a Fi ) + l(i) * ~uin ), self-assemble the set ((Ti \u222a Fi ) + l(i) * ~u), for any i \u2208 N.\nCase 2 In the second case, we generate, for each ~u \u2208 {(0, 1), (1, 0)}, the same three sets of tile\ntypes (TS~u , TX~u , and TY~u ) that self-assemble the set ((Ti \u222a Fi ) + l(i) * ~u) \"on top of\" the set\n((Ti\u22121 \u222a Fi\u22121 ) + l(i \u2212 1) * ~uin ), for any i \u2208 N.\nS\nFinally, we let TX = (0,0)6=~u\u2208V T~u , where T~u = TS~u \u222a TX~u \u222a TYu~ . Figure 4 gives a visual\ninterpretation of the second phase of our construction. Our TAS is TX = (TX , \u03c3, 2), where \u03c3\nconsists of a single \"seed\" tile type placed at the origin. Our full construction yields a tile set of\n5983 tile types for the fractal generated by the points in the left-most image in Figure 4.\n\n5.3\n\nDetails of Construction\n\nNote that in our construction, the self-assembly of the sub-structures S~u , Y~u , and X~u can proceed\neither forward (away from the axes) or backward (toward the axes).\n\n\fY~u\nPSfrag replacements\nS~u\n\nX~u\n\n(0,0)\n\nFigure 4: Let V be the left-most image. The first arrow represents phase 2 of the construction. The\nsecond arrow shows a magnified view of a particular point in V . Each point (0, 0) 6= ~u \u2208 V can be viewed\nconceptually as three components: the tile sets TSu~ , TXu~ and TYu~ that ultimately self-assemble the square\nSu~ , and the horizontal and vertical rectangles Xu~ and Yu~ respectively.\n\n5.3.1\n\nForward Growth\n\nWe now discuss the self-assembly of the set ((Ti \u222a Fi ) + ~u * l(i)) for ~u \u2208 V satisfying ~uin \u2208\n(~u + {(\u22121, 0), (0, \u22121)}).\nIf ~u 6\u2208 {(0, 0), (0, 1), (1, 0)} (i.e., case 1 of phase 2), then the tile set\nTS~u self-assembles the square S~u directly on top (or to the right) of,\n2 2 2\nand having the same width (height) as, the rectangle Y~uin (X~uin ). If\n2 2 1\n~u \u2208 {(0, 1), (1, 0)} (i.e., case 2 of phase 2), then the tile set TS~u self2 2 0\n2 1 2\nassembles the square S~u on top (or to the right) of the set Y~uin such that\n2 1 1\nright (top) edge of the former is flush with that of the latter. Note that\n2 1 0\n2 0 2\nin case 2, the width of Y~uin is always one less than that of S~u . In either\n2 0 1\ncase, it is straightforward to construct such a tile set TS~u .\n2 0 0\n2 0 0\nThe tile set of TY~u self-assembles a fixed-width base-c counter (based\n1 2 2\non the \"optimal\" binary counter presented in [4]) that, assuming a width\n1 2 1\n1 2 0\nof i \u2208 N, implements the following counting scheme: Count each positive\n1 1 2\ni\ninteger j, satisfying 1 \u2264 j \u2264 c \u2212 1, in order but count each number\n1 1 1\n1 1 0\nexactly\n1 0 2\n[[c divides j]] * \u03c1(j) + [[c does not divide j]] * 1\n1 0 1\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1 0 0\ntimes, where \u03c1(j) is the largest number of consecutive least-significant\n0 2 2\n0's in the base-c representation of j, and [[\u03c6]] is the Boolean value of the\n0 2 1\n0 2 0\nstatement \u03c6. The value of a row is the number that it represents. We\n0 1 2\nrefer to any row whose value is a multiple of c as a spacing row. All\n0 1 1\n0 1 0\nother rows are count rows. The type of the counter that self-assembles\n0 0 2\nY~u is ~u.\n0 0 1\nEach counter self-assembles on top (or to the right) of the square S~u ,\nwith the width of the counter being determined by that of the square. It Figure 5: Example of a\nis easy to verify that if the width of Su~ is i + 2, then TY~ self-assembles base-3 modified binary\nu\n~\ncounter.\nThe darker\na rectangle having a width of i + 2 and a height of\n\n\u0001\nc2 + 1 ci +\n\nci\n\n\u22121\n= l(i) \u2212 (i + 2),\nc\u22121\n\nshaded rows\nspacing rows.\n\nare\n\nthe\n\n\fwhich is exactly Y~u . Figure 5 shows the counting scheme of a base-3 counter of width 3. We\nconstruct the set TX~u by simply reflecting the tile types in TY~u about the line y = x, whence\nthe three sets of tile types TS~u , TX~u , and TY~u self-assemble the \"outer framework\" of the set\n((Ti \u222a Fi ) + ~u * l(i)).\nThe \"internal structure\" of the set ((Ti \u222a Fi ) + ~u * l(i)) self-assembles as follows. Oppositely\noriented counters attach to the right side of each contiguous group of spacing rows in the counter\n(of type ~u) that self-assembles Y~u . The number of such spacing rows determines the height of\nthe horizontal counter, and its type is (0, j/c mod c), where j is the value of the spacing rows to\nwhich it attaches. We also hard code the glues along the right side of each non-spacing row to\nself-assemble the internal structure of the points in the set T0 .\nThe situation for X~u is similar (i.e., a reflection of its vertical counterpart), with the exception\nthat the glues along the top of each non-spacing row are configured differently than they were for\nY~u . This is because nice self-similar fractals need not be symmetric.\nOne can prove that, by recursively attaching smaller oppositely-oriented counters (of the appropriate type) to larger counters in the above manner, the internal structure of ((Ti \u222a Fi ) + ~u * l(i))\nself-assembles.\n5.3.2\n\nReverse Growth\n\nWe now discuss the self-assembly of the set ((Ti \u222a Fi ) + ~u * l(i)), for all ~u \u2208 V satisfying ~uin \u2208\n(~u + {(1, 0), (0, 1)}).\nIn this case, the tile set TY~u (TX~u ) self-assembles the set Y~u (X~u ) directly below (or to the left\nof) the square S~uin , and grows toward the x-axis (or y-axis) according to the base-c counting scheme\noutlined above. We also configure TY~u (TX~u ) so that the right (or top)-most edge of Y~u (X~u ) is\nessentially the \"mirror\" image of its forward growing counterpart (See Figure 6). This last step\nensures that the internal structure of ((Ti \u222a Fi ) + ~u * l(i)) self-assembles correctly. Next, the square\nPSfrag replacements\nPSfrag\nS~u attaches to thePSfrag\nbottomreplacements\n(or left)-most edge\nof Y~ureplacements\n(X~u ). Finally, the set X~u (Y~u ) self-assembles\nS\nS~u\nu\n~\nvia forward growth from the left (or top) of the square S~u .\nXu~\nX~u\nX~u\nX~u\nX~u\nS~uin\nS~uin\nX~u\nX~u\nS~uin\nS~uin\nX~u\nS~uin\nS~uin\nX~u\nS\nX~u\nX~u ~u\nX~u\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nFigure 6: (a) depicts forward growth, (b) shows what happens if the tile set TXu~ were to simply \"count in\nreverse,\" and (c) is the desired result.\n\n5.3.3\n\nProof of Correctness\n\nTo prove the correctness of our construction, we use a local determinism argument. The details of\nthe proof are technical, and therefore omitted from this version of the paper.\n\n\f6\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this paper, we (1) established two new absolute limitations of the TAM, and (2) showed that\nfibered versions of \"nice\" self-similar fractals strictly self-assemble. Our impossibility results motivate the following question: Is there a discrete self-similar fractal X ( N2 that strictly self-assembles\nin the TAM? Moreover, our positive result leads us to ask: If X ( N2 is a discrete self-similar fractal, then is it always the case that X has a \"fibered\" version X that strictly self-assembles, and\nthat is similar to X in some reasonable sense?\nAcknowledgment\nWe thank Dave Doty, Jim Lathrop, Jack Lutz, and Aaron Sterling for useful discussions.\n\nReferences\n[1] Leonard M.
