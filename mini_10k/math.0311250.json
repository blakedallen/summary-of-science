In this paper, we prove that each automorphism of\nthe Torelli group of a surface is induced by a diffeomorphism of the\nsurface, provided that the surface is a closed, connected, orientable\nsurface of genus at least 3. This result was previously announced by\nBenson Farb for genus at least 4 and has recently been announced\nby Benson Farb and Nikolai Ivanov for subgroups of finite index\nin the Torelli group for surfaces of genus at least 5. This result is\nalso directly analogous to previous results established for classical\nbraid groups, mapping class groups, and surface braid groups.\n\n1. Introduction\nLet S be a closed, connected, oriented surface of genus g. The extended mapping class group M\u2217 of S is defined to be the group of\nisotopy classes of homeomorphisms S \u2192 S. The mapping class group\nM of S is defined to be the subgroup of index 2 in M of isotopy\nclasses of orientation preserving homeomorphisms S \u2192 S. The Torelli\ngroup T of S is the subgroup of M consisting of the isotopy classes of\nthose orientation preserving homeomorphisms S \u2192 S that induce the\nidentity permutation of the first homology group of S.\nIn this paper, we show that any given automorphism \u03a8 : T \u2192 T is\ninduced by a homeomorphism S \u2192 S provided that g > 2. This result\nis trivially true for g < 2, as T is trivial for g < 2. On the other hand,\nby a result of Mess, this result is false for g = 2. Indeed, Mess showed\nthat T is a nonabelian free group of infinite rank for g = 2 [Me]. It\nfollows that the automorphism group of T for g = 2 is uncountable\nas it contains a copy of the permutation group of an infinite set, any\nfree basis for T . An automorphism of T induced by a homeomorphism\nh : S \u2192 S only depends upon the isotopy class of h in M\u2217 . Since\nM\u2217 is finitely generated [B] and, hence, countable, it follows that only\nDate: November 13, 2003.\n1991 Mathematics Subject Classification.

VAUTAW\n\ncountably many elements of the automorphism group of T are induced\nby homeomorphisms S \u2192 S.\nIn several formal and informal announcements made between October 2001 and March 2002, Benson Farb announced that he had proved\nthat any given automorphism \u03a8 : T \u2192 T is induced by a homeomorphism S \u2192 S provided that g > 3 [F]. In his thesis, [V1], the second\nauthor laid the foundation for proving that it is true for g > 2. This\ninvolves three basic steps, two of which were finished in [V1]. In the\nfirst step, completed in [V1], Vautaw characterized algebraically certain elements of the Torelli group, namely powers of Dehn twists about\nseparating curves and powers of bounding pair maps. The second step,\nleft unfinished in [V1], is to show that \u03a8 induces an automorphism\n\u03a8\u2217 : C \u2192 C, where C is the complex of curves of S. In the last step,\ncompleted in [V1], Vautaw used a theorem of Ivanov which states that\n\u03a8\u2217 is induced by a homeomorphism H : S \u2192 S of the surface S [Iv1],\nand concluded, under the assumption that it is possible to complete the\nsecond step, that the automorphism of the Torelli group induced by H\nagrees with the given automorphism \u03a8 (i.e. \u03a8([F ]) = [H \u25e6 F \u25e6 H \u22121 ]\nfor every mapping class [F ] in T ).\nThe purpose of this paper is to complete the second step and, hence,\nestablish the main theorem, Conjecture 1 of [V1]:\nTheorem 1 . Let S be a closed, connected, orientable surface of genus\ng 6= 2, and let \u03a8 : T \u2192 T be an automorphism of the Torelli group T\nof S. Then \u03a8 is induced by an homeomorphism h : S \u2192 S. That is,\nthere exists an homeomorphism H : S \u2192 S such that for any mapping\nclass [F ] in T , we have \u03a8([F ]) = [H \u25e6 F \u25e6 H \u22121 ].\n\nThis result is analogous to results previously established for classical braid groups [DG], mapping class groups [I], [Iv2], [IvM], [K], [M]\nand surface braid groups [IIvM]. As noted above, it fails for g = 2.\nRecently, Farb and Ivanov have established the analogue of this result\nfor subgroups of finite index in the Torelli group of surfaces of genus\nat least 5 [FIv]. They obtain this result as a consequence of an analogue of Ivanov's result on automorphisms of complex of curves [Iv1]\n(see also [I] and [K]). This result of Farb and Ivanov subsumes Farb's\nprevious result except for surfaces of genus 4. In this work, they use a\ncharacterization of powers of Dehn twists about separating curves and\npowers of bounding pair maps (Proposition 8 of [FIv]) equivalent to\nthe second author's characterization (Theorem 3.5 of [V1]).\n2. Preliminaries\nWe have the following results from the second author's thesis [V1].\n\n\fAUTOMORPHISMS OF TORELLI GROUPS\n\n3\n\nProposition 2.1. Let Vsep denote the set of isotopy classes of essential\nseparating circles on S. Let a be an element of Vsep . Then there exists a\nunique element c of Vsep such that either \u03a8(Da ) = Dc or \u03a8(Da ) = Dc\u22121 .\nProposition 2.2. Let Vnonsep denote the set of isotopy classes of nonseparating circles on S. Let BP be the set of ordered pairs (a, b) of\nelements of Vsep such that {a, b} is a bounding pair on S. Let (a, b)\nbe an element of BP. Then there exists a unique element (e, f ) of BP\nsuch that \u03a8(Da \u25e6 Db\u22121 ) = De \u25e6 Df\u22121 .\nAs explained in [V1], these results are derived from the characterizations of elementary twists in the second author's thesis, Theorems\n3.5, 3.7, and 3.8 of [V1]. These characterizations are analogous to\ncorresponding characterizations used in previous works on automorphisms of subgroups of the mapping class group (e.g. [I], [Iv2], [IvM],\n[K], [M]). As is true for these previous characterizations, these characterizations are established by using the theory of abelian subgroups\nof mapping class groups developed in the work of Birman-LubotzkyMcCarthy [BLM] from Thurston's theory of surface diffeomorphisms\n[FLP].\n3. Two-holed tori\nWe shall use the following generalization of the Centralizer Lemma\nof [V2].\nProposition 3.1. Let S be a connected, closed, orientable surface of\ngenus g > 2. Let R be an embedded two-holed torus in S such that both\ncomponents, a and b, of the boundary \u2202R of R are essential separating\ncurves on S. Let \u03a8 : T \u2192 T be an automorphism of the Torelli\ngroup T of S. Let \u0393R denote the subgroup of T consisting of mapping\nclasses of homeomorphisms S \u2192 S which are supported on R. Then\nthe restriction of \u03a8 to \u0393R is induced by a homeomorphism H : S \u2192 S.\nThat is, there exists an homeomorphism H : S \u2192 S such that for any\nmapping class [F ] in \u0393R , we have \u03a8([F ]) = [H \u25e6 F \u25e6 H \u22121 ].\nThe proof of this proposition follows the lines of the proof of the\nCentralizer Lemma of [V2]. From Propositions 2.1 and 2.2, it follows that we may assume without loss of generality that \u03a8 : T \u2192 T\nrestricts to an automorphism \u03a8 : \u0393R \u2192 \u0393R . The result is established by relating the restriction \u03a8 : \u0393R \u2192 \u0393R to an automorphism\n\u03c7 : \u03c01 (T, x) \u2192 \u03c01 (T, x) of the fundamental group \u03c01 (T, x) of a oneholed torus T . The one-holed torus T corresponds to the quotient of\nR obtained by collapsing one of the boundary components a of R to a\n\n\f4\n\nJ. D. MCCARTHY AND W. R. VAUTAW\n\nbasepoint x for T . The relevant relationship between \u0393R and \u03c01 (T, x)\nis obtained from the long-exact homotopy sequence of an appropriate fibration. One of the key ingredients in the argument establishing\nthis relationship is the well-known contractibility of the identity component of the group of diffeomorphisms of surfaces of negative euler\ncharacteristic [EE]. It is a well-known classical fact that an automorphism of the fundamental group \u03c01 (T, x) of a one-holed torus T is\ninduced by a diffeomorphism (T, x) if and only if it preserves the peripheral structure of \u03c01 (T, x) [ZVoC]. As in the proof of the Centralizer\nLemma of [V2], we show that this peripheral structure corresponds\nto Dehn twists about separating curves of genus 1 in the two-holed\ntorus R. Together with Propositions 2.1 and 2.2, this allows us to appeal to the aforementioned classical fact to obtain a homeomorphism\nH : (S, R, a, b) \u2192 (S, R, a, b) whose restriction H : (R, a, b) \u2192 (R, a, b)\ndescends to a homeomorphism (T, x) \u2192 (T, x) inducing the automorphism \u03c7 : \u03c01 (T, x) \u2192 \u03c01 (T, x). We then show, as in the proof of the\nCentralizer Lemma of [V2], using Propositions 2.1 and 2.2, that H\nsatisfies the conclusion on Proposition 3.1.\nWe note that a similar argument relating certain subgroups of mapping class groups to fundamental groups of punctured surfaces appears\nin the work of Irmak-Ivanov-McCarthy on automorphisms of surface\nbraid groups, in which they prove the analogue of Theorem for certain\nsurface braid groups [IIvM].\n4. Orientation type\nIn this section, we show how to ascribe an orientation type, \u01eb, to\nany given automorphism \u03a8 : T \u2192 T . This is achieved by studying\nthe action of \u03a8 on the separating twists in T . We show that either\n(i) \u03a8 sends right separating twists to right separating twists or (ii) \u03a8\nsends right separating twists to left separating twists. If (i) holds, we\nsay that \u03a8 is orientation-preserving and let \u01eb = 1. If (ii) holds, we say\nthat \u03a8 is orientation-reversing and set \u01eb = \u22121.\nThe proof of this result uses the following connectivity result.\nProposition 4.1. Let Csep be the subcomplex of C whose simplices are\nthose simplices of C all of whose vertices are isotopy classes of essential\nseparating circles on S. Then Csep is connected.\nProof. Let a and b be elements of Csep . Choose circles A and B in the\nisotopy classes a and b so that A and B intersect transversely and the\ngeometric intersection i(a, b) of a and b is equal to the number of points\nof intersection of A and B. Since A is a separating circle on S and the\ngenus of S is at least 3, A separates S into two one-holed surfaces with\n\n\fAUTOMORPHISMS OF TORELLI GROUPS\n\n5\n\nboundary A, at least one of which has genus at least 2. Let R be one\nof these two-holed surfaces with boundary A and genus at least 2.\nOur goal is to find a path in Cs ep from a to b. Since A and B are\nseparating circles, i(a, b) is even. We shall prove the result by induction\non i(a, b). We may assume that i(a, b) > 0. Simple arguments show\nthat an appropriate path exists if i(a, b) is equal to 2 or 4. Hence, it\nsuffices to find a separating circle C such that i(a, c) \u2264 4 and i(c, b) <\ni(a, b).\nRoughly speaking, such a circle C can be constructed as follows.\nSurger A into two essential simple closed curves A1 and A2 in the\ninterior of R by using one of the component arcs J of B \u2229 R, so that\nA \u222a A1 \u222a A2 is the boundary of a tubular neighborhood N of A \u222a J in\nR. If either A1 or A2 is separating, then we choose C as either A1 or\nA2 , whichever is separating. Otherwise, by tubing A1 to A2 along an\nappropriately chosen arc K joining A1 to A2 and intersecting A twice,\nwe may construct an essential separating circle C such that i(a, c) \u2264 4\nand i(c, b) < i(a, b).\n\u0003\nRemark 4.2. Farb and Ivanov announced this result in their recent\npaper (see Theorem 4 of [FIv]). They point out that they deduce this\nresult as a consequence of a stronger result regarding separating circles\nof genus 1. We note that this stronger result follows from Proposition\n4.1. Indeed, suppose that a1 ,...,an+1 is a sequence of isotopy classes\nof essential separating circles, a1 has genus 1, i(aj , aj+1 ) = 0 for 1 \u2264\nj \u2264 n and an+1 has genus 1. Suppose that ak has genus > 1 for some\ninteger k with 1 < k < n + 1. Represent ak\u22121 , ak and ak+1 by essential\nseparating circles Ak\u22121 , Ak and Ak+1 on S with Ak\u22121 and Ak+1 disjoint\nfrom Ak . Note that Ak separates S into two one-holed surfaces, P and\nQ, each of genus > 1. We may assume, without loss of generality, that\nAk\u22121 is in the interior of P . Either (i) Ak+1 is in the interior of P or\n(ii) Ak+1 is in the interior of Q. In case (i), we may replace ak by the\nisotopy class of some separating circle of genus 1 in Q. In case (ii),\nwe may delete ak . In either case, we obtain a path in Csep from a1 to\nan+1 with fewer vertices of genus > 1 than the chosen path a1 ,...,an+1 .\nHence, the stronger result follows by induction on the number of vertices\nof genus > 1 in the chosen path.\nUsing Proposition 4.1, we may now establish the main result of this\nsection.\nProposition 4.3. Let \u03a8 : T \u2192 T be an automorphism of the Torelli\ngroup T . Then there exists an \u01eb in {\u22121, 1} such that for each essential\nseparating circle a on S, \u03a8(Da ) = Dc\u01eb for some essential separating\ncircle c on S.\n\n\f6\n\nJ. D. MCCARTHY AND W. R. VAUTAW\n\nProof. Let a be an essential separating circle on S. By Proposition\n2.1, either \u03a8(Da ) = Dc or \u03a8(Da ) = Dc\u22121 , for some essential separating\ncircle c on S.\nSuppose, for instance, that \u03a8(Da ) = Dc . Then \u03a8(Da ) is a right\ntwist.\nLet b be an essential separating circle on S. By Proposition 4.1,\nthere exists a sequence ai , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n of essential separating circles\non S such that (i) a1 = a, (ii) ai is disjoint from ai+1 for 1 \u2264 i < n,\nand (iii) an is isotopic to b. We may assume, furthermore, that (iv)\nai is not isotopic to ai+1 for 1 \u2264 i < n. Let i be an integer such that\n1 \u2264 i < n. Then, by the above assumptions, ai \u222a ai+1 is the boundary\nof a compact connected subsurface Ri of S of genus gi \u2265 1. Clearly, by\nappropriately \"enlarging\" the sequence ai , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, we may assume,\nfurthermore, that (v) gi = 1 for 1 \u2264 i < n.\nLet fi denote the twist about ai , so that f1 = Da and fn = Db .\nSuppose that (i)-(v) hold and let i be an integer such that 1 \u2264 i < n.\nThen, we may apply Proposition 3.1 to the embedded torus with two\nholes Ri in S, since both boundary components, ai and ai+1 , of this\ntorus are essential separating circles on S. It follows, therefore, that the\nrestriction of \u03a8 to \u0393(Ri ) is induced by a homeomorphism h : S \u2192 S.\nNote that Di and Di+1 are both in \u0393(Ri ). Hence, \u03a8(Di ) = h\u2217 (Di ) and\n\u03a8(Di+1 ) = h\u2217 (Di+1 ). If h is orientation reversing, then h\u2217 (Di ) and\nh\u2217 (Di+1 ) are both left twists. If h is orientation reversing, then h\u2217 (Di )\nand h\u2217 (Di+1 ) are both right twists. Hence, \u03a8(Di ) and \u03a8(Di+1 ) are\neither both left twists or both right twists. It follows that the images\n\u03a8(Dj ), 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n are either all left twists or all right twists.\nSince \u03a8(Da ) is a right twist, \u03a8(D1 ) is a right twist. Hence, \u03a8(Dn )\nis a right twist. That is to say, \u03a8(Db ) is a right twist. In other words,\n\u03a8(Db ) = Dd for some essential separating circle d on S.\nHence, if \u03a8(Da ) = Dc for some essential separating circle c on S,\nthen the result holds with \u01eb = 1. Likewise, if \u03a8(Da ) = Dc\u22121 for some\nessential separating circle c on S, then the result holds with \u01eb = \u22121. \u0003\nHenceforth, we say that an automorphism \u03a8 : T \u2192 T is orientationreversing if \u01eb = \u22121 and orientation-preserving if \u01eb = 1, where \u01eb is\nthe constant in Proposition 4.3. In other words, an automorphism\n\u03a8 : T \u2192 T is orientation-reversing (orientation-preserving) if and only\nif it sends right twists about essential separating circles on S to left\n(right) twists about essential separating circles on S. We shall refer to\nthe constant \u01eb as the orientation type of \u03a8.\nWe have shown that each automorphism of the Torelli group is either\norientation-preserving or orientation-reversing. In other words, there\n\n\fAUTOMORPHISMS OF TORELLI GROUPS\n\n7\n\nare no \"hybrid\" automorphisms of the Torelli group, sending some right\ntwists to right twists and other right twists to left twists.\n5. Induced automorphisms of the complex of separating\ncurves\nIn this section, we show how any given automorphism of the Torelli\ngroup induces an automorphism of the complex of separating curves\non S.\nBy Proposition 4.3, it follows that each automorphism of T induces\na permutation of the set of isotopy classes of essential separating circles\non S.\nProposition 5.1. Let \u03a8 : T \u2192 T be an automorphism. Let \u01eb be\nthe orientation type of \u03a8. Let Vsep denote the set of isotopy classes of\nessential separating circles on S. Then:\n\u2022 There exists a unique function \u03a8\u2217 : Vsep \u2192 Vsep such that, for\neach a in Vsep , \u03a8(Da ) = Db\u01eb where b = \u03a8\u2217 (a)\n\u2022 \u03a8\u2217 : Vsep \u2192 Vsep is a bijection\nSince two essential separating circles have trivial geometric intersection if and only if the twists about the circles commute, it follows that\nthe induced map \u03a8\u2217 : Vsep \u2192 Vsep is simplicial.\nProposition 5.2. Let \u03a8 : T \u2192 T be an automorphism of T . Let\n\u03a8\u2217 : Vsep \u2192 Vsep be the unique function of Proposition 5.1. Then\n\u03a8\u2217 : Vsep \u2192 Vsep extends to a simplicial automorphism \u03a8\u2217 : Csep \u2192 Csep\nof Csep .\n6. Nonseparating circles\nIn this section, we show how \u03a8 induces a map of the set Vnonsep of\nisotopy classes of nonseparating circles on S.\nSuppose that (a, b) is an ordered bounding pair on S. That is to say,\na and b are elements of Vnonsep represented by disjoint nonseparating\ncircles, A and B, on S such that the complement of A \u222a B in S is\ndisconnected. Note that A\u222aB is the boundary of exactly two embedded\nsurfaces in S, L and R. Moreover, L \u2229 R = A \u222a B.\nBy Proposition 2.2, \u03a8(Da \u25e6 Db\u22121 ) = De \u25e6 Df\u22121 for some bounding pair\n{e, f } on S. Let \u01eb be the orientation type of \u03a8. De \u25e6 Df\u22121 = (Dc \u25e6 Dd\u22121 )\u01eb\nwhere {c, d} = {e, f }.\nIt follows that to each ordered bounding pair (a, b) there exists a\nunique ordered bounding pair (c, d) such that \u03a8(Da \u25e6 Db\u22121 ) = (Dc \u25e6\nDd\u22121 )\u01eb .\n\n\f8\n\nJ. D. MCCARTHY AND W. R. VAUTAW\n\nProposition 6.1. There exists a unique function \u03a8\u2217 : BP \u2192 BP\nsuch that if (a, b) is an element of BP and (c, d) = \u03a8\u2217 (a, b), then\n\u03a8(Da \u25e6 Db\u22121 ) = (Dc \u25e6 Dd\u22121 )\u01eb , where \u01eb is the orientation type of \u03a8.\n\nWe shall obtain the induced map \u03a8\u2217 : Vnonsep \u2192 Vnonsep by showing\nthat the first coordinate c of \u03a8\u2217 (a, b) does not depend upon the second\ncoordinate b of (a, b).\nTo this end, let a be an element of Vnonsep and let BP a be the set of\nelements b of Vnonsep such that (a, b) is an ordered bounding pair on S.\nSuppose that b and c are distinct elements of BP a . We say that\n(a, b, c) is a k-joint based at a if the geometric intersection number of b\nand c is equal to k. Since (a, b) and (a, c) are ordered bounding pairs on\nS, we may orient any representative circles, A, B, and C, of a, b, and\nc so that they are homologous on S. Since the oriented representative\ncircles B and C of b and c are homologous, i(b, c) is even.\nThe following result will help us to establish the desired invariance\nof the first coordinate of \u03a8\u2217 (a, b).\nProposition 6.2. Let (a, b, c) be a k-joint based at a. Let (e, f ) =\n\u03a8\u2217 (a, b) and (g, h) = \u03a8\u2217 (a, c). Suppose that j1 and j2 are distinct\nelements of Vnonsep such that i(ji , a) = i(ji , b) = i(ji , c) = 1 and\ni(j1 , j2 ) = 0. Then e = g.\nProof. Note that a, b, c, j1 and j2 may be represented by transverse\nnonisotopic nonseparating circles A, B, C, J1 , and J2 on S such that\nA is disjoint from B and C; and J1 and J2 intersect each of B and C\nin exactly one point.\nLet Pi denote a regular neighborhood of the graph A\u222aJi \u222aB, i = 1, 2.\nLet Qi denote a regular neighborhood of the graph A \u222a Ji \u222a C, i = 1, 2.\nNote that P1 and Q1 are embedded two-holed tori on S. Since (a, b)\nand (a, c) are bounding pairs, it follows that each of the boundary\ncomponents of Pi and Qi are essential separating circles on S. Hence,\nby Proposition 3.1, there exists a homeomorphism Gi : S \u2192 S such that\n\u03a8([F ]) = [Gi \u25e6 F \u25e6 G\u22121\ni ] for every homeomorphism F : S \u2192 S which is\nsupported on Pi and acts trivially on the first homology of S. Likewise,\nby Proposition 3.1, there exists a homeomorphism Hi : S \u2192 S such\nthat \u03a8([F ]) = [Hi \u25e6 F \u25e6 Hi\u22121 ] for every homeomorphism F : S \u2192 S\nwhich is supported on Qi and acts trivially on the first homology of S.\nLet Ri be a regular neighborhood on S of the graph A \u222a Ji such that\nRi is contained in the interiors of both Pi and Qi . Note that Ri is a\none-holed torus. Let Di be the boundary of Ri . Since the genus of S\nis not equal to one, Di is an essential separating circle on S.\nLet U = D1 and u be the isotopy class of D1 on S. By Propositions\n2.1 and 4.3 , \u03a8(Du ) = Dv\u01eb for some element v of Vsep .\n\n\fAUTOMORPHISMS OF TORELLI GROUPS\n\n9\n\nNote that Du is represented by a twist map DU supported on P1 .\n\u22121\nHence, \u03a8(Du ) = [G1 \u25e6 DU \u25e6 G\u22121\n1 ]. Note that [G1 \u25e6 DU \u25e6 G1 ] is equal to\n[DX ]\u03b1 where X = G1 (U) and \u03b1 is the orientation type of the homeomorphism G1 : S \u2192 S. Let x denote the isotopy class of X on S. Then\nDx\u03b1 = Dv\u01eb . This implies that x = v and \u03b1 = \u01eb. Hence, v is represented\nby the circle X and the homeomorphism G1 has the same orientation\ntype as the automorphism \u03a8.\nLikewise, if Y = H1 (U), then v is represented by the circle Y and\nthe homeomorphism H1 has the same orientation type as the automorphism \u03a8.\nSince v is represented by both X and Y , X is isotopic to Y . Hence,\nwe may assume that X = Y . Let R1\u2032 = G1 (R1 ). Note that R1\u2032 is an\nembedded one-holed torus with boundary X. Since the genus of S is at\nleast 3, R1\u2032 is the unique embedded one-holed torus in S with boundary\nX. Let R1 \" = H1 (R1 ). Note that R1 \" is an embedded one-holed torus\nwith boundary Y . Since X = Y , R1\u2032 = R1 \".\n\u22121\nNote that Da \u25e6 Db\u22121 is represented by a bounding pair map DA \u25e6 DB\nwhere DA is a twist map supported on P1 and DB is a twist map\nsupported on P1 . Hence, by the preceding observations, \u03a8(Da \u25e6Db\u22121 ) =\n(Dp \u25e6 Dq\u22121 )\u01eb where p is the isotopy class of G1 (A) and y is the isotopy\nclass of G1 (B). On the other hand, since (e, f ) = \u03a8\u2217 (a, b), \u03a8(Da \u25e6\nDb\u22121 ) = (De \u25e6 Df\u22121 )\u01eb . It follows that e = p and f = q. Since e = p,\nit follows that e is represented by the circle G1 (A). Note that G1 (A)\nis contained in the interior of the embedded torus R1\u2032 . We conclude\nthat e is represented by the circle G1 (A) contained in the interior of\nthe embedded torus R1\u2032 .\nLikewise, g is represented by the circle H1 (A) and H1 (A) is contained\nin the interior of the embedded torus R1 \". Since R1 \" = R1\u2032 , H1 (A) is\ncontained in the interior of the embedded torus R1\u2032 .\nIt follows that e and g are both represented by circles contained in\nthe interior of the unique one-holed torus R1\u2032 bounded by G1 (D1 ).\nLikewise, e and g are both represented by circles contained in the\ninteriors of the unique one-hole torus R2\u2032 bounded by G2 (D2 ).\nLet di denote the isotopy class of Di on S. Note that di is an element\nof Vsep . By the preceding considerations, \u03a8\u2217 (di ) = ei , where ei is the\nisotopy class of Gi (Di ), i = 1, 2.\nSuppose that i(e1 , e2 ) = 0. By Proposition 5.2, it follows that\ni(d1 , d2 ) = 0. Hence, we may assume, by an isotopy of D2 , that D1\nand D2 are disjoint. Since the one-holed tori, R1 and R2 , both contain\nA, it follows that D1 is isotopic to D2 . Hence, by a further isotopy\nof D2 , we may assume that D1 = D2 and, hence, R1 = R2 . Since J1\n\n\f10\n\nJ. D. MCCARTHY AND W. R. VAUTAW\n\nand J2 are disjoint nonseparating circles, i(j1 , j2 ) = 0. Hence, J1 and\nJ2 are isotopic to disjoint nonseparating circles in the one-holed torus\nR1 . Since any two disjoint nonseparating circles in a one-holed torus\nare isotopic, it follows that j1 = j2 . This contradicts our assumptions.\nHence, i(e1 , e2 ) is not equal to 0.\nBy an isotopy of G2 (D2 ) we may assume that G1 (D1 ) and G2 (D2 )\nare transverse essential separating circles with minimal intersection.\nBy the preceding observations, i(e, ei ) = i(g, ei ) = 0, i = 1, 2. Hence,\nwe may represent e and g by nonseparating circles E and G on S such\nthat E and G are each disjoint from both G1 (D1 ) and G2 (D2 ).\nIt follows that E and G are both contained in the interior of the\nunique one-holed torus, R1\u2032 , with boundary G1 (D1 ), and both miss the\nintersection of G2 (D2 ) with R1\u2032 . SInce i(e1 , e2 ) is not equal to 0, the\nintersection of G2 (D2 ) with R1\u2032 consists of at least one essential properly\nembedded arc, K.\nSince any two nonseparating circles in a given one-holed torus missing a given essential properly embedded arc in the given one-holed torus\nare isotopic in the given one-holed torus, it follows that E is isotopic\nto G on S.\nHence, e = g.\n\u0003\nProposition 6.3. Let (a, b, c) be a 0-joint. Let (e, f ) = \u03a8\u2217 (a, b) and\n(g, h) = \u03a8\u2217 (a, c). Then e = g.\nProof. Note that a, b, and c may be represented by disjoint nonisotopic\nnonseparating circles A, B, and C on S. Since (a, c) is a bounding pair\non S, A \u222a C is the boundary of exactly two embedded surfaces on\nS, L and R. Note that L and R are both connected surfaces and\nL \u2229 R = A \u222a C. Since B is disjoint from A and C, B is contained in\none of the two components of the complement of A \u222a C in S. That is\nto say, either B is contained in the interior of L or B is contained in\nthe interior of R. We may assume that B is contained in the interior\nof L.\nSince (a, b) is a bounding pair on S, it follows that L is the union of\ntwo embedded surfaces, P and Q, on S such that A\u222aB is the boundary\nof P , B \u222a C is the boundary of Q, and P \u2229 Q = B.\nNote that the embedded surfaces, P , Q, and R, have disjoint interiors, P \u2229 Q = B, Q \u2229 R = C, R \u2229 P = A, P \u2229 Q \u2229 R is empty, and\nP \u222aQ\u222aR = S. Moreover, P , Q, and R each have exactly two boundary\ncomponents; \u2202P = A \u222a B, \u2202Q = B \u222a C, and \u2202R = C \u222a A. Since a,\nb, and c are distinct isotopy classes, P , Q, and R each have positive\ngenus.\n\n\fAUTOMORPHISMS OF TORELLI GROUPS\n\n11\n\nSince B is not isotopic to C, the genus of Q is positive. Hence, there\nexists a pair of disjoint, nonseparating circles D1 and D2 on S such that\nQ is the union of two embedded connected surfaces, QL and QR , on S,\nwhere the interiors of QL and QR are disjoint; the boundary of QL is\nequal to B \u222a J1 \u222a J2 ; and the boundary of QR is equal to J1 \u222a J2 \u222a C.\nChoose distinct points, p1 and p2 , on A; distinct points, q1 and q2 on\nB; a point r1 on D1 ; a point r2 on D2 ; and distinct points, s1 and s2\non C. Choose disjoint properly embedded arcs, P1 and P2 , on L such\nthat P1 joins p1 to q1 , and P2 joins p2 to q2 . Choose disjoint properly\nembedded arcs, M1 and M2 , on QL such that M1 joins q1 to r1 ; and M2\njoins q2 to r2 . Choose disjoint properly embedded arcs, N1 and N2 , on\nQR such that N1 joins r1 to s1 ; and N2 joins r2 to s2 . Choose disjoint\nproperly embedded arcs, R1 and R2 , on R such that R1 joins s1 to p1\nand R2 joins s2 to p2 .\nLet Ji = Pi \u222a Mi \u222a Ni \u222a Ri , i = 1, 2. Note that J1 and J2 are disjoint\ncircles on S; each of these two circles is transverse to A, B, D1 , D2 ,\nand C; and each of these two circles intersects each of the circles, A,\nB, and C, in exactly one point. It follows that each of these two circles\nare nonseparating circles on S.\nLet ji denote the isotopy class of Ji on S, i = 1, 2.\nNote that each of the circles, Ji , is transverse to D1 . J1 intersects\nD1 in exactly one point, whereas J2 is disjoint from D1 . It follows\nthat the geometric intersection of J1 with D1 is equal to 1, whereas the\ngeometric intersection of J2 with D1 is equal to 0.\nIt follows that j1 and j2 are distinct elements of Vnonsep with i(ji , a) =\ni(ji , b) = i(ji , c) = 1, i = 1, 2, and i(j1 , j2 ) = 0. Hence, by Proposition\n6.2, e = g.\n\u0003\nRemark 6.4. If the genus of S is at least 5, it can be shown that BP a is\nthe vertex set of a connected subcomplex of C. In other words, any two\nelements b and c of BP a are connected by a sequence b1 = b, ..., bn = c\nof elements of BP\u22a3 such that (a, bi , bi+1 ) is a 0 \u2212 joint based at a,\n1 \u2264 i < n. Hence, Proposition 6.3 is sufficient for the purpose of\nobtaining the desired induced map \u03a8\u2217 : Vnonsep \u2192 Vnonsep when g > 4.\nOne of the main reasons why this result is so much more difficult to\nachieve when g is equal to 3, is that this connectivity result is no longer\ntrue when g = 3. (We do not know whether it is true when g = 4.)\nIndeed, when g = 3, there are no edges in C with both vertices in BP a .\nOne of the key ideas for obtaining the main result of this paper for\ng > 2 is to include with the edges of C which join elements of BP a more\ngeneral connections between elements of BP a which leave invariant the\n\n\f12\n\nJ. D. MCCARTHY AND W. R. VAUTAW\n\nfirst coordinate of \u03a8\u2217 (a, b) and provide paths between any two elements\nof BP a .\nThe first such connection is provided by our next result.\nProposition 6.5. Let (a, b, c) be a 2-joint based at a. Let (e, f ) =\n\u03a8\u2217 (a, b) and (g, h) = \u03a8\u2217 (a, c). Then e = g.\nProof. We may represent a, b, and c by circles, A, B, and C, on S such\nthat A is disjoint from B and C; B is transverse to C; and B and C\nintersect in exactly two points, x and y.\nSince (a, b) and (a, c) are bounding pairs, we may orient A, B, and\nC so that the the oriented circles, A, B, and C are homologous on\nS. Since B and C are homologous, the algebraic (i.e. homological)\nintersection of B and C is equal to 0. It follows that the signs of\nintersection of B with C at x and y are opposite. We assume that\nthe sign of intersection of B with C at x is positive and the sign of\nintersection of B with C at y is negative.\nThe above considerations imply that a regular neighborhood P on S\nof the graph B \u222a C is a four-holed sphere. We may assume that A is\ncontained in the complement of P .\nSince B and C are transverse circles on S with geometric intersection 2, it follows that each of the four boundary components of P is an\nessential circle on S. Indeed, suppose that one of the four boundary\ncomponents of P bounds a disc D on P . Then P \u222a D is an embedded\npair of pants with B and C in the interior of P \u222a D. Note that any two\ncircles in a pair of pants have geometric intersection 0. Indeed, any\ncircle in a pair of pants on S is isotopic to one of the three boundary\ncomponents on the pair of pants [FLP]. Hence, B and C have geometric intersection 0. This is a contradiction. Hence, each of the four\nboundary components of P is an essential circle on S.\nThe two points, x and y, divide the oriented circle B into two oriented\narcs, B1 and B2 , where B1 begins at x and ends at y, B2 begins at y\nand ends at x, B1 \u222a B2 = B, and B1 \u2229 B2 = {x, y}. Likewise, the two\npoints, x and y divide the oriented circle C into two oriented arcs, C1\nand C2 , where C1 begins at x and ends at y, C2 begins at y and ends\nat x, C1 \u222a C2 = C, and C1 \u2229 C2 = {x, y}.\nLet i and j be integers with 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 2. Note that Bi \u222a Cj is a circle\nin the interior of P . There is a unique embedded annulus A(i,j) in P\nsuch that the boundary of A(i,j) consists of Bi \u222a Cj and a component\nD(i,j) of the boundary of P . P is equal to the union of the four annuli,\nA(i,j) ; these annuli have disjoint interiors; and these annuli meet exactly\nalong those edges of the graph B \u222a C which they have in common.\n\n\fAUTOMORPHISMS OF TORELLI GROUPS\n\n13\n\nOrient the boundary of P so that P is on the right of its boundary.\nWith this orientation, the cycle D(1,1) is homologous to B1 \u2212 C1 ; the\ncycle D(1,2) is homologous to \u2212C2 \u2212 B1 ; the cycle D(2,2) is homologous\nto \u2212B2 + C2 ; the cycle D(2,1) is homologous to C1 + B2 ; the cycle B\nis homologous to B1 + B2 ; and the cycle C is homologous to C1 + C2 .\nBy our assumptions, B is homologous to C. This implies that B1 + B2\nis homologous to C1 + C2 ; and B1 \u2212 C1 is homologous to \u2212B2 + C2 .\nHence, the cycles D(1,1) and D(2,2) are homologous.\nNote that the cycle D(1,1) + D(1,2) + D(2,2) + D(2,1) is homologous to\n0, since it represents the boundary of the oriented surface P . This\nimplies that the cycle D(1,2) + D(2,1) is homologous to D(1,1) + D(2,2) .\nOn the other hand, since D(1,1) is homologous to D(2,2) , D(1,1) + D(2,2) is\nhomologous to 2D(1,1) . Hence, D(1,2) + D(2,1) is homologous to 2D(1,1) .\nNote that the cycle D(1,2) + D(2,1) is homologous to an oriented circle\nE contained in the interior of P . E is obtained by tubing the oriented\ncircle D(1,2) to the oriented circle D(2,1) along a properly embedded arc\nJ in P joining a point on the boundary component D(1,2) of P to a\npoint on the boundary component D(2,1) of P .\nSuppose that D(1,1) is not homologous to 0. Then, since the homology of an oriented surface is torsion free, 2D(1,1) is not homologous to\n0. Hence, E is not homologous to 0. This implies that E is a nonseparating circle on S. It follows that the homology class of E is not\ndivisible by 2. Indeed, E is not divisible by any integer greater than 1.\nOn the other hand, E is homologous to 2D(1,1) . This is a contradiction.\nHence, D(1,1) is homologous to 0.\nNote that B is homologous to D(1,1) + D(2,1) . Since D(1,1) is homologous to 0, it follows that B is homologous to D(2,1) . Since A is\nhomologous to B, it follows that A is homologous to D(2,1) .\nSince A is nonseparating, the homology class of A is not 0. Hence,\nthe homology class of D(2,1) is not zero. This implies that D(2,1) is an\nessential circle on S.\nLet d denote the isotopy class of the essential circle D(2,1) on S.\nSuppose that d is not equal to a. Since P is disjoint from A and\nD(2,1) is a boundary component of P , D(2,1) is disjoint from A. Since\nD(2,1) is disjoint from A and homologous to A, it follows that (a, d) is\na bounding pair on S.\nNote that D(2,1) is also disjoint from B and C, since P is a regular\nneighborhood of B \u222a C. Since i(c, d) = 0 and i(c, b) = 2, d is not equal\nto b. Hence, (a, b, d) is a 0-joint based at a. Hence, by Proposition\n6.3, the first coordinate of \u03a8\u2217 (a, b) is equal to the first coordinate of\n\u03a8\u2217 (a, d).\n\n\f14\n\nJ. D. MCCARTHY AND W. R. VAUTAW\n\nSimilarly, (a, d, c) is a 0-joint based at a and, hence, the first coordinate of \u03a8\u2217 (a, d) is equal to the first coordinate of \u03a8\u2217 (a, c).\nHence, the first coordinate of \u03a8\u2217 (a, b) is equal to the first coordinate\nof \u03a8\u2217 (a, c). In other words, e = g, as desired.\nHence, we may assume that d is equal to a. It follows that A is\nisotopic to D(2,1) . Since A and D(2,1) are disjoint essential circles on S\nand the genus of S is not equal to 1, it follows that A \u222a D(2,1) is the\nboundary of exactly one embedded annulus L on S. Since D(2,1) is a\nboundary component of P and A is in the complement of P , it follows\nthat L \u2229 P = D(2,1) .\nNote that P \u222a L is an embedded four-holed sphere on S with boundary D(1,1) \u222a D(1,2) \u222a D(2,2) \u222a A.\nSince D(1,2) + D(2,1) is homologous to E and E is homologous to 0, it\nfollows that D(1,2) is homologous to \u2212D(2,1) . Since D(2,1) is homologous\nto A, it follows that D(1,2) is homologous to \u2212A. As before, for A\nand D(2,1) , it follows that A \u222a D(1,2) is the boundary of exactly one\nembedded annulus R on S.\nSince A is a nonseparating circle on S, it follows that A \u222a D1,2) is the\nboundary of exactly two embedded surfaces on S. The annulus R is one\nof these two surfaces. Let Q be the other of these two surfaces. Note\nthat R and Q are both connected. Hence, either P \u222a L is contained in\nR or P \u222a L is contained in Q.\nSuppose that P \u222a L is contained in R. Then the essential circles\nB and C on S are both contained in the interior of the annulus R.\nSince i(b, c) = 2, this is a contradiction. Indeed, any two circles in an\nannulus have zero geometric intersection number. It follows that P \u222a L\nis contained in Q.\nThis implies that the four-holed sphere P \u222aL and the annulus R have\ndisjoint interiors and (P \u222a L) \u2229 R = A \u222a D(2,1) . It follows that P \u222a L \u222a R\nis an embedded two-holed torus, Z, on S with boundary components\nD(1,1) and D(2,2) . Since D(1,1) and D(2,2) are boundary components of\nP , they are essential circles on S. Hence, we may apply Proposition\n3.1 to the embedded two-holed torus Z on S.\nIt follows that there is a homeomorphism H : S \u2192 S such that\n\u03a8([F ]) = [H \u25e6 F \u25e6 H \u22121 ] for every homeomorphism F : S \u2192 S such that\nF is supported on Z and F acts trivially on the first homology of S.\nLet U be a circle in the interior of Z such that U is isotopic to the\nboundary component D(1,1) of Z. Let u denote the isotopy class of the\nessential separating circle U on S. Note that u is an element of Vsep .\nLet v = \u03a8\u2217 (u). Then \u03a8(Du ) = Dv\u01eb .\nNote that the element Du of T is represented by a twist map DU\nsupported on Z. Hence, \u03a8(Du ) = [H \u25e6 DU \u25e6 H \u22121]. Note that [H \u25e6 DU \u25e6\n\n\fAUTOMORPHISMS OF TORELLI GROUPS\n\n15\n\nH \u22121] is equal to Dw\u03b1 where w is the isotopy class of the essential circle\nH(U) and \u03b1 is the orientation type of the homeomorphism H : S \u2192 S.\nThen Dw\u03b1 = Dv\u01eb . This implies that \u03b1 = \u01eb. Hence, the homeomorphism\nH has the same orientation type as the automorphism \u03a8.\nNote that A, B, and C are contained in the interior of Z. Hence,\nthe twists, Da , Db , and Dc , are represented by twist maps, DA , DB ,\nand DC , supported on Z. It follows that \u03a8(Da \u25e6 Db\u22121 ) = (Dp \u25e6 Dq )\u03b1\nwhere p is the isotopy class of H(A) and q is the isotopy class of H(B).\nFurthermore, \u03a8(Da \u25e6 Dc\u22121 ) = (Dp \u25e6 Dr\u22121 )\u03b1 where r is the isotopy class\nof H(C).\nHence, (Dp \u25e6 Dq\u22121 )\u03b1 = (De \u25e6 Df\u22121 )\u01eb and (Dp \u25e6 Dr\u22121 )\u03b1 = (Dg \u25e6 Dh\u22121 )\u01eb .\nSince \u03b1 = \u01eb, it follows that e = p, f = q, g = p, and h = r. Hence,\ne = g.\n\u0003\nRemark 6.6. If the genus of S is at least 4, it can be shown that if\n(a, b, c) is a 2-joint based at a, then b and c are connected by a sequence\nb1 = b, ..., bn = c of elements of BP\u22a3 such that (a, bi , bi+1 ) is a 0 \u2212 joint\nbased at a. Part of the proof of this fact is implicit in the proof of\nProposition 6.5. Following this proof, it is clear that it remains only to\nconsider the situation when the representative circles A, B and C are\ncontained in a two-holed torus Z as in the last part of this proof.\nIn addition to the connections provided by 0-joints and 2-joints based\nat a, we shall use one more type of connection. This third type of\nconnection is provided by our next result.\nProposition 6.7. Let (a, b, c) be a 4-joint based at a. Let (e, f ) =\n\u03a8\u2217 (a, b) and (g, h) = \u03a8\u2217 (a, c). Then e = g.\nProof. We may represent the isotopy classes a, b, and c in Vnonsep be\nnonseparating circles, A, B, and C, on S such that A is disjoint from\nB and C; B and C are transverse; and B and C intersect in exactly 4\npoints.\nSince (a, b) is a bounding pair on S, A\u222aB is the boundary of exactly\ntwo embedded surfaces L and R on S. Note that the interiors of L and\nR are disjoint and L \u2229 R = A \u222a B. Orient the circle A and B so that\nthe boundary of the oriented surface L is equal to the difference A \u2212 B\nof the cycles A and B. Note that, with the chosen orientations, L is\non the left of A and B, and R is on the right of A and B. Note that\nthe cycles A and B are homologous on S.\nSince (a, c) is a bounding pair on S, we may orient the circle C so\nthat C is homologous on S to A. Since A \u222a B is transverse to C, and\nA\u222aB intersects C in exactly four points, and all four of these points lie\non B, it follows that C \u2229R is a disjoint union of two properly embedded\n\n\f16\n\nJ. D. MCCARTHY AND W. R. VAUTAW\n\narcs, C1 and C3 , in R; and C \u2229 L is equal to a disjoint union of two\nproperly embedded arcs, C2 and C4 , in L. We may label these arcs so\nthat the oriented arc C1 joins a point w on B to a point x on B; the\noriented arc C2 joins the point x on B to a point y on B; the oriented\narc C3 joins the point y on B to a point z on B; and the oriented arc\nC4 joins the point z on B to the point w on B.\nNote that it follows, from the above considerations, that, as we travel\nalong the oriented circle C, the signs of intersection of B with C alternate. Likewise, by interchanging the roles of B and C in the previous\nargument, it follows that the signs of inersection of B with C alternate\nas we travel along B. Hence, we may choose the notation Ci , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 4,\nso that the sign of intersection of B with C at w is positive.\nIt follows that the sign of intersection of B with C at x is negative;\nthe sign of intersection of B with C at y is positive; and the sign of\nintersection of B with C at z is negative. Since the signs of intersection\nof B with C alternate as we travel along the oriented circle B, it follows\nthat the points of intersection occur in one of the following two orders\nas we travel along B, beginning at w: (i) (w, x, y, z) or (ii) (w, z, y, x).\nSuppose that (i) holds. Note that the points of intersection of B\nwith C divide the oriented circle B into oriented arcs, Bi , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 4.\nWe may choose the notation Bi so that B1 joints w to x; B2 joins x to\ny; B3 joints y to z; and B4 joins z to w.\nIt follows that a regular neighborhood on S of the graph B \u222a C\nis a six-holed sphere P . We may assume that A is contained in the\ncomplement of P . P is the union of six embedded annuli, Ai , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 6,\non S. These annuli have disjoint interiors on S. There is a unique\nboundary component of P , Di , such that Di is one of the two boundary\ncomponents of Ai . The other boundary component of Ai is a cycle in\nthe graph B \u222a C. We may choose the notation Ai , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 6, so that\nthe boundary component of A1 contained in the interior of P is the\ncycle C1 \u2212 B1 ; the boundary component of A2 contained in the interior\nof P is the cycle B2 \u2212 C2 ; the boundary component of A3 contained\nin the interior of P is the cycle C3 \u2212 B3 ; the boundary component of\nA4 contained in the interior of P is the cycle B1 + C2 + B3 + C4 ; the\nboundary component of A5 contained in the interior of P is the cycle\n\u2212B4 \u2212 C3 \u2212 B2 \u2212 C1 ; and the boundary component of A6 contained in\nthe interior of P is the cycle B4 \u2212 C4 .\nNote that the oriented circle B is homologous to the cycle B1 +\nB2 + B3 + B4 ; and the oriented cycle C is homologous to the cycle\nC1 + C2 + C3 + C4 . By our assumptions, B is homologous to C. It\nfollows that D1 \u2212 D2 + D3 \u2212 D4 is homologous to 0.\n\n\fAUTOMORPHISMS OF TORELLI GROUPS\n\n17\n\nOn the other hand, D1 + D2 + D3 + D4 + D5 + D6 is homologous\nto 0. Hence, D5 + D6 is homologous to \u22122(D1 + D3 ). As in the proof\nof Proposition 6.5, the fact that D5 + D6 is homologous to a circle\nin P , obtained by tubing D5 to D6 along a properly embedded arc J\nin P , implies that D1 + D3 and D5 + D6 are both homologous to 0.\nAgain, the homology class of a nonseparating oriented circle on S is\nprimitive (i.e. not a proper multiple of any nonzero homology class).\nSince D1 + D2 + D3 + D4 + D5 + D6 is also homologous to 0, it follows\nthat D2 + D4 is homologous to 0.\nNote that D2 + D4 is homologous to the cycle B \u2212 D6 . Since D2 + D4\nis homologous to 0, it follows that B is homologous to D6 . Since B is\nnonseparating on S, D6 is nonseparating on S.\nSince D5 + D6 is homologous to 0, D5 is homologous to \u2212D6 . Since\nD6 is a nonseparating circle on S and D5 is a circle disjoint from D6 , it\nfollows that D5 \u222a D6 is the boundary of exactly two embedded surfaces\nin S. Note that these two surfaces are each connected, have disjoint\ninteriors, and intersect exactly along D5 \u222a D6 . Their interiors are the\ntwo connected components of the complement of D5 \u222a D6 in S. Note\nthat P is contained in one of these two surfaces. Let Q be the other\nof these two surfaces. Since Q is connected and the boundary of Q\nis equal to D5 \u222a D6 , there exists a properly embedded arc M on Q\njoining a point u on D5 to a point v on D6 . Note, furthermore that\nthere exists a properly embedded arc N on P joining u to v such that\nN is disjoint from C, transverse to B, and intersects B in exactly one\npoint, p. Moreover, we may choose N so that p lies in the interior of\nB4 .\nIt follows that M \u222a N is a circle on S such that the geometric intersection of M \u222aN with B is equal to 1, and the geometric intersection of\nM \u222a N with C is equal to 0. Note that we may orient the circle M \u222a N\nso that the algebraic (i.e. homological) intersection of M \u222a N with B is\nequal to 1. Since B is homologous to C, this implies that the algebraic\nintersection of M \u222a N with C is equal to 1. On the other hand, since\nM \u222a N is disjoint from C, the algebraic intersection of M \u222a N with C\nis equal to 0. This is a contradiction.\nHence (ii) holds. Note that the points of intersection of B with C\ndivide the oriented circle B into oriented arcs, Bi , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 4. We may\nchoose the notation Bi so that B1 joints w to z; B2 joins z to y; B3\njoints y to x; and B4 joins x to w.\nIt follows that a regular neighborhood on S of the graph B \u222a C\nis a six-holed sphere P . We may assume that A is contained in the\ncomplement of P . P is the union of six embedded annuli, Ai , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 6,\non S. These annuli have disjoint interiors on S. There is a unique\n\n\f18\n\nJ. D. MCCARTHY AND W. R. VAUTAW\n\nboundary component of P , Di , such that Di is one of the two boundary\ncomponents of Ai . The other boundary component of Ai is a cycle in\nthe graph B \u222a C. We may choose the notation Ai , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 6, so that\nthe boundary component of A1 contained in the interior of P is the\ncycle B1 + C4 ; the boundary component of A2 contained in the interior\nof P is the cycle \u2212B4 \u2212 C1 ; the boundary component of A3 contained\nin the interior of P is the cycle C2 + B3 ; the boundary component of\nA4 contained in the interior of P is the cycle \u2212C4 + B2 \u2212 C2 + B4 ; the\nboundary component of A5 contained in the interior of P is the cycle\nC1 \u2212 B3 + C3 \u2212 B1 ; and the boundary component of A6 contained in\nthe interior of P is the cycle \u2212B2 \u2212 C3 .\nNote that the oriented circle B is homologous to the cycle B1 +\nB2 + B3 + B4 ; and the oriented cycle C is homologous to the cycle\nC1 +C2 +C3 +C4 . By our assumptions, B is homologous to C. It follows\nthat D4 \u2212 D5 is homologous to 0. Hence, the cycle D4 is homologous\nto the cycle D5 .\nThis implies that D4 + D5 is homologous to 2D4 . As in the proof\nof Proposition 6.5, the fact that D4 + D5 is homologous to a circle in\nP , obtained by tubing D4 to D5 along a properly embedded arc J in\nP , implies that D4 and D4 + D5 are both homologous to 0. Again, the\nhomology class of a nonseparating oriented circle on S is primitive (i.e.\nnot a proper multiple of any nonzero homology class). Since D4 and\nD4 + D5 are both homologous to 0, it follows that D5 is homologous to\n0.\nSince B and C are transverse circles on S with minimal intersection,\nit follows that each of the boundary components, D1 , D3 , D2 , and D6\nare essential circles on S [FLP].\nSince D1 +D2 +D3 +D4 +D5 +D6 , D4 , and D5 are all homologous to\n0, D1 + D3 is homologous to \u2212(D2 + D6 ). It follows that 2(D1 + D3 ) is\nhomologous to the cycle (B1 + C4 ) + (C2 + B3 ) + (B4 + C1 ) + (B2 + C3).\nHence, 2(D1 + D3 ) is homologous to B + C. Thus, 2(D1 + D3 ) is\nhomologous to 2B. This implies that D1 + D3 is homologous to B.\nHence, (D1 + D3 ) is homologous to A. Since D1 + D3 is homologous to\n\u2212(D2 + D6 ), it follows that (D2 + D6 ) is homologous to \u2212A.\nSuppose that D1 and D2 are both separating circles on S. Then D3\nis homologous to A and D6 is homologous to \u2212A. Suppose that the\ncircle D3 is not isotopic to A. Let d be the isotopy class of D3 . Then\n(a, b, d) and (a, c, d) are both 0-joints based at a. Hence, by Proposition\n6.3, the first coordinates of \u03a8\u2217 (a, b) and \u03a8\u2217 (a, c) are both equal to the\nfirst coordinate of \u03a8\u2217 (a, d). Hence, e = g. Hence, we may assume\nthat D3 is isotopic to A. Since the genus of S is not equal to 1, it\nfollows that A \u222a D3 is the boundary of exactly one embedded annulus\n\n\fAUTOMORPHISMS OF TORELLI GROUPS\n\n19\n\nL on S. Note that P is in the complement of the interior of L. Hence,\nthe boundary of the oriented annulus L is equal to A \u2212 D3 . Likewise,\nwe may assume that D6 is isotopic to \u2212A and conclude that there is\nexactly one embedded annulus R of S with boundary A \u222a D6 and the\nboundary of the oriented annulus R is equal to \u2212(A + D6 ).\nIt follows that P \u222a L \u222a R is an embedded two-holed torus Q on\nS; A \u222a B \u222a C is contained in the interior of Q; and each of the two\nboundary components of Q, D2 and D6 , are essential separating circles\non S. Hence, by Proposition refprop:twoholedtori, it follows, as in the\nproof of Proposition 6.5, that e = g.\nHence, we may assume that D1 and D2 are not both separating circles. Likewise, we may assume that D1 and D6 are not both separating\ncircles on S; D3 and D2 are not both separating circles on S; and D3\nand D6 are not both separating circles on S.\nSuppose that D1 is a separating circle on S. Then D3 is homologous\nto A. Again, we may assume that D3 is isotopic to A. Hence, D3 \u222a A\nis the boundary of exactly one embedded annulus L in S, and the\nboundary of the oriented annulus L is equal to A \u2212 D3 .\nSince D1 is a separating circle on S, D2 and D6 are both nonseparating circles on S. Since D2 + D6 is homologous to \u2212A, it follows that\nD2 \u222a D6 \u222a A is the boundary of exactly two embedded surfaces on S.\nThe interiors of these two surfaces are the two connected components\nof the complement of D1 \u222a D2 \u222a A in S. One of these two surfaces\ncontains P . Let R be the other of these two surfaces. Note that the\nboundary of the oriented surface R is equal to \u2212(A + D2 + D6 ).\nChoose distinct points, p1 and p2 , on A; distinct points, q1 and q2 on\nD3 ; a point r1 on D2 ; and a point r2 on D6 . Choose disjoint properly\nembedded arcs, P1 and P2 , on L such that P1 joins p1 to q1 , and P2\njoins p2 to q2 . Choose disjoint properly embedded arcs, Q1 and Q2 ,\non P such that Q1 joins q1 to r1 ; Q2 joins q2 to r2 ; Q1 and Q2 are\nboth transverse to B and C; Q1 intersects B \u222a C exactly at x; and Q2\nintersects B \u222a C exactly at y. Choose disjoint properly embedded arcs,\nR1 and R2 , on R such that R1 joins r1 to p1 and R2 joins r2 to p2 .\nLet Ji = Pi \u222a Qi \u222a Ri , i = 1, 2. Note that J1 and J2 are disjoint\ncircles on S; each of these two circles is transverse to A, B, and C;\nand each of these two circles intersects each of the circles, A, B, and\nC, in exactly one point. It follows that each of these two circles are\nnonseparating circles on S. Let ji denote the isotopy class of Ji on S,\ni = 1, 2.\nNote that each of the circles, Ji , is transverse to D2 . J1 intersects\nD2 in exactly one point, whereas J2 is disjoint from D2 . It follows\n\n\f20\n\nJ. D. MCCARTHY AND W. R. VAUTAW\n\nthat the geometric intersection of J1 with D2 is equal to 1, whereas the\ngeometric intersection of J2 with D2 is equal to 0.\nIt follows that j1 and j2 are distinct common duals to the 4-joint\n(a, b, c) with i(j1 , j2 ) = 0. Hence, by Proposition 6.2, e = g.\nHence, we may assume that D1 is a nonseparating circle on S. Likewise, we may assume that D3 , D2 , and D6 are nonseparating circles on\nS. Since D1 + D3 is homologous to A, and D1 , D2 , and D3 are disjoint\nnonseparating curves, it follows that D1 \u222a D2 \u222a A is the boundary of\nexactly two embedded surfaces in S. These two surfaces are each connected, and have disjoint interiors. The interiors of these two surfaces\nare the two connected components of the complement of D1 \u222a D2 \u222a A\nin S. One of these two surfaces contains P . Let L be the other of these\ntwo surfaces. Note that the boundary of the oriented surface L is equal\nto A \u2212 (D1 + D3 ).\nLikewise, D2 \u222a D6 \u222a A is the boundary of exactly two embedded\nsurfaces in S. These two surfaces are each connected, and have disjoint\ninteriors. The interiors of these two surfaces are the two connected\ncomponents of the complement of D2 \u222a D6 \u222a A in S. One of these two\nsurfaces contains P . Let R be the other of these two surfaces. Note\nthat the boundary of the oriented surface R is equal to \u2212(A+D2 +D6 ).\nAs in the previous case, we may construct two disjoint circles, Ji ,\ni = 1, 2, such that Ji is transverse to A, B, and C; Ji intersects each of\nA, B and C in exactly one point; Ji is transverse to D2 ; J1 intersects\nD2 in exactly one point; and J2 is disjoint from D2 .\nAgain, it follows that the isotopy classes, ji , i = 1, 2 of Ji , i =\n1, 2 are distinct common duals of the 4-joint (a, b, c) based at a with\ni(j1 , j2 ) = 0. Hence, as in the previous case, it follows, by Proposition\nrefprop:commonduals, that e = g.\nHence, in any case, e = g.\n\u0003\nRemark 6.8. If the genus of S is at least 5, it can be shown that if\n(a, b, c) is a 4-joint based at a, then b and c are connected by a sequence\nb1 = b, ..., bn = c of elements of BP\u22a3 such that (a, bi , bi+1 ) is a 0 \u2212 joint\nbased at a. We do not know whether this fact is true when the genus\nof S is 4.\nOur next result will allow us to show that the connections provided\nby Propositions 6.3, 6.5, and 6.7 are sufficient to prove the desired\ninvariance of the first coordinate of \u03a8\u2217 (a, b).\nProposition 6.9. Let a be an element of Vnonsep . Let b and c be elements of BP a . Then there exists a sequence bi , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n of elements\nof BP a such that (i) b1 = b, (ii) bn = c, and (iii) i(bi , bi+1 ) \u2264 4,\n1 \u2264 i < n.\n\n\fAUTOMORPHISMS OF TORELLI GROUPS\n\n21\n\nProof. Represent a, b, and c by circles A, B, and C on S such that\nA is disjoint from B and C, B and C are transverse to each other,\nand the number of intersection points of B and C is minimal (i.e.\n#(B \u2229 C) = i(b, c)). Let k be the number of points of intersection of\nB and C (i.e. k = i(b, c)). The proof is by induction on k.\nThe assertion of Proposition 6.9 clearly holds if k = 0. In this case,\nlet n = 2, b1 = b, and b2 = c. Hence, we shall assume that k > 0.\nOrient the circle A. Since (a, b) is a ordered bounding pair A \u222a B\nis the boundary of two embedded surfaces on S, LB and RB , with\nLB \u2229 RB = A \u222a B. Moreover, we may orient B so that the homology\nclasses of the oriented circles A and B are equal. Likewise, we may\norient C so that the homology classes of the oriented circles A and C\nare equal.\nNote that the intersection of C with RB is a disjoint union of properly\nembedded arcs in RB , each joining a point of intersection of B and C\nto another point of intersection of B with C. Each of these properly\nembedded arcs on RB is either separating or nonseparating on RB .\nLet J be one of the components of C \u2229RB . Suppose that J separates\nRB . Note that exactly one of the two components of the complement\nof J in RB contains the boundary component A of RB . Denote the\nclosure of this component by P . Note that the boundary of P consists\nof two circles on S, A and a circle D. The points x and y on D divide\nD into two arcs joining x to y, DB and DC , where DB lies on B and DC\nlies on C. Note that DC = J. Since B and C are transverse essential\ncircles with minimal intersection, D is an essential circle on S.\nLet BP be a circle in the interior of P such that BP and D bound\nan embedded annulus in P . Since BP is isotopic on S to the essential\ncircle D on S, BP is also essential on S.\nLet Q be the closure of the other component of the complement of\nJ in RB . Note that P \u2229 Q = J. The boundary of Q consists of a single\ncircle E. The points x and y on E divide E into two arcs joining x\nto y, EB and EC , where EB lies on B and EC lies on C. Note that\nEC = J, DB \u222a EB = B, and DB \u2229 EB = {x, y}.\nLet BQ be a circle in the interior of Q such that BQ and E bound an\nannulus in Q. As for D and BP , E and BQ are both essential circles\non S. Since BP and Q bound an annulus in Q, we may orient BQ and\nE so that the oriented circles BP and Q are homologous in Q. Since\nE bounds Q, E is nullhomologous on S. Hence, BQ is nullhomologous\non S.\nNote that B \u222a BP \u222a BQ is the boundary of a pair of pants R in S.\nThe arc J is properly embedded in R, joining the boundary component\nB of R to itself, and separating the other two boundary components\n\n\f22\n\nJ. D. MCCARTHY AND W. R. VAUTAW\n\nof R, BP and BQ , from each other. In familiar terminology, BP \u222a BQ\nis the result of tubing B to itself along the arc J.\nNote that C is transverse to the submanifold BP \u222aBQ and the number\nof intersection points of C with BP \u222a BQ is equal to k \u2212 2. This implies\nthat the number of intersection points with C of each of the essential\ncircles, BP and BQ , is less than k.\nSince the boundary of P consists of A and D, we may orient D so\nthat the oriented circles A and D are homologous. Since BP is isotopic\nto D, we may orient BP so that the oriented circles BP and D are\nhomologous. Hence, the oriented circles BP and A are homologous.\nOn the other hand, BP and A are disjoint.\nSuppose that BP is not isotopic to A on S. Let b\u2032 be the isotopy\nclass of BP . By the above considerations, {a, b\u2032 } is a bounding pair,\ni(b, b\u2032 ) = 0 and i(b\u2032 , c) < k. Hence, the result follows by applying the\ninductive hypothesis to the elements b\u2032 and c of BP a .\nHence, we may assume that BP is isotopic to A on S. Since BP\nand A are disjoint essential circles, it follows that BP and A bound\nan annulus on S. Note that the disjoint essential circles, BP and A\nbound exactly two embedded surfaces on S. One of these two surfaces\nis P . Since BP is contained in the interior of RB , the other of these\ntwo surfaces contains the surface of positive genus, LB . It follows that\nthis other surface is not an annulus. Hence, P is an annulus.\nConsider the arc DB of D joining x to y along B. Suppose that C\nintersects DB at a point u in the interior of DB . Note that there is\nexactly one component J \u2032 of C \u2229 RB with u as one of its two endpoints.\nNote that J \u2032 lies in the annulus P and both endpoints of J \u2032 lie in the\ninterior of the arc DB . These two endpoints of J \u2032 are therefore joined\nby an arc F embedded in the interior of DB . It follows that J \u2032 separates\nthe annulus P into two components, one of which is a disk and the other\nof which is an annulus. Since B and C are transverse essential circles\nwith minimal intersection, the disc component cannot contain the arc\nF on its boundary. This implies that the disc component contains the\narc J on its boundary.\nIt follows that the unique component P \u2032 of the complement of J \u2032\nin RB which contains A is an annulus contained in P . Moreover, the\nboundary component D \u2032 of P containing J \u2032 consists of J \u2032 and an arc\n\u2032\n\u2032\nDB\nof B joining u to a point v in the interior of DB . Moreover, DB\nis\n\u2032\ncontained in the interior of DB . Indeed, DB\nis the arc F .\nIt follows that we may assume, by choosing an \"innermost\" arc J,\nthat the interior of DB contains no points of C.\nLet K be the unique component of C \u2229 LB such that y is the initial\nendpoint of K. Since the interior of DB contains no points of C, the\n\n\fAUTOMORPHISMS OF TORELLI GROUPS\n\n23\n\nterminal endpoint of K is not in the interior of DB . Suppose that\nthis endpoint is x. Then C = J \u222a K and, hence, B \u2229 C = {x, y}.\nHence, since B and C intersect minimally, i(b, c) = 2. Clearly, in this\nsituation, the result holds.\nHence, we may assume that the terminal endpoint of K is a point z\nin the interior of EB . This implies that there is an arc K \u2032 parallel to\nK joining a point on BP to a point on BQ such that K \u2032 is contained\nin the complement of C, K \u2032 is transverse to B, and K \u2032 intersects B in\nexactly two points, u and v, where u is a point in the interior of DB\nnear the endpoint y of DB and v is a point in the interior of EB near\nz.\nLet B \u2032 be a circle obtained by tubing BP to BQ along K \u2032 . The above\nconsiderations imply that (i) B \u2032 is disjoint from A, (ii) B \u2032 is homologous\nto B, (iii) B \u2032 and B are transverse and have minimal intersection, (iv)\nB \u2032 and B intersect in exactly 4 points, (v) B \u2032 and C are transverse and\n(vi) the number of points of intersection of B \u2032 and C is equal to k \u2212 2.\nLet b\u2032 be the isotopy class of B \u2032 . By the above considerations, it\nfollows that b\u2032 is not equal to a, (a, b\u2032 ) is a bounding pair, i(b\u2032 , b) = 4\nand i(b\u2032 , c) \u2264 k \u2212 2. The result follows, in this situation, by applying\nthe inductive hypothesis to b\u2032 and c.\nIt remains to consider the case where there is at least one component\nJ of C \u2229 RB such that the complement of J in RB is connected. This\ncase is handled in a manner similar to the previous case. Again, we tube\nB to itself along J producing a disjoint union B1 \u222aB2 of disjoint oriented\ncircles B1 and B2 whose homology classes add up to the homology class\nof B.\nIn this situation, we assume the notations B1 and B2 are chosen so\nthat B1 corresponds to the oriented arc N1 of the oriented circle B\nwhich joins the initial endpoint x of the oriented arc J to the terminal\nendpoint y of J and B2 corresponds to the oriented arc N2 of B joining\ny to x.\nAgain, we let K be the unique component of C \u2229 LB having the\nterminal endpoint y of J as its initial endpoint. Again, if the terminal\nendpoint of K is equal to x, then C = J \u222a K, i(b, c) = 2, and the result\nclearly holds.\nHence, we may assume that the terminal endpoint of K is a point z\nin the interior of Ni for some integer i in {1, 2}. Suppose that z is in\nthe interior of N1 . Then we may tube B2 to B1 along an arc K \u2032 parallel\nto K, crossing N2 at a point u in the interior of N2 near y and N1 at\na point v in the interior of N1 near z. This results in a curve B \u2032 with\nwhich the proof proceeds by induction as before.\n\n\f24\n\nJ. D. MCCARTHY AND W. R. VAUTAW\n\nSuppose, on the other hand, that z is in the interior of N2 . In this\ncase, we may tube B1 to B2 along an arc K \u2032 parallel to K, crossing\nN1 at a point u in the interior of N1 near y and N2 at a point v in the\ninterior of N2 near z. This results in a curve B \u2032 with which the proof\nproceeds by induction as before.\n\u0003\nWe are now ready to establish the desired invariance of the first\ncoordinate of \u03a8\u2217 (a, b).\nProposition 6.10. Let a be an element of Vnonsep . Suppose that b\nand c are distinct elements of BP a . Let (e, f ) = \u03a8\u2217 (a, b) and (g, h) =\n\u03a8\u2217 (a, c). Then e = g.\nProof. By Proposition 6.9, there exists a sequence bi , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n of\nelements of BP a such that b1 = b, bn = c, and i(bi , bi+1 ) \u2264 4, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n.\nSuppose that i is an integer with 1 \u2264 i < n. Let (ei , fi ) = \u03a8\u2217 (a, bi ).\nNote that (e1 , f1 ) = (e, f ) and (en , fn ) = (g, h).\nBy the above observations, (a, bi , bi+1 ) is a k-joint based at a for some\neven integer k with 0 \u2264 k \u2264 4. Hence, k is an element of {0, 2, 4}. It\nfollows, from Propositions 6.3, 6.5, and 6.7, that ei = ei+1 .\nThus, by induction, e1 = en . That is to say, e = g.\n\u0003\nThe preceding results now provide us with the desired induced map\n\u03a8\u2217 : Vnonsep \u2192 Vnonsep .\n\nProposition 6.11. Let \u03a8 : T \u2192 T be an automorphism of T . Let \u01eb be\nthe orientation type of \u03a8. Let Vnonsep denote the set of isotopy classes\nof nonseparating circles on S. Then:\n\u2022 There exists a unique function \u03a8\u2217 : Vnonsep \u2192 Vnonsep such that,\nfor each bounding pair (a, b) on S, \u03a8(Da \u25e6 Db\u22121 ) = (Dc \u25e6 Dd\u22121 )\u01eb ,\nwhere c = \u03a8\u2217 (a) and d = \u03a8\u2217 (b).\n\u2022 \u03a8\u2217 : Vnonsep \u2192 Vnonsep is a bijection.\nProof. By Proposition 6.10, there exists a well-defined function \u03a8\u2217 :\nVnonsep \u2192 Vnonsep defined by the rule \u03a8\u2217 (a) = c if and only if for each\nelement b of BP a , \u03a8\u2217 (a, b) = (c, d) for some element d in BP d .\nLet (a, b) be a bounding pair on S. Let (c, d) = \u03a8\u2217 (a, b). By the\ndefinition of \u03a8\u2217 : Vnonsep \u2192 Vnonsep , c = \u03a8\u2217 (a). On the other hand, by\nthe definition of \u03a8\u2217 : BP \u2192 BP given in Proposition 6.1, \u03a8(Da \u25e6Db\u22121 ) =\n(Dc \u25e6 Dd\u22121 )\u01eb . Since \u03a8 : T \u2192 T is a homomorphism, this implies that\n\u03a8(Db \u25e6Da\u22121 ) = (Dd \u25e6Dc\u22121 )\u01eb . Hence, by the definition of \u03a8\u2217 : BP \u2192 BP,\n\u03a8\u2217 (b, a) = (d, c). Hence, by the definition of \u03a8\u2217 : Vnonsep \u2192 Vnonsep ,\nd = \u03a8\u2217 (b).\nThis proves the existence of a function \u03a8\u2217 as described in the first\nclause of Proposition 6.11.\n\n\fAUTOMORPHISMS OF TORELLI GROUPS\n\n25\n\nSuppose that \u03a8# : Vnonsep \u2192 Vnonsep is a function such that, for\neach bounding pair (a, b) on S, \u03a8(Da \u25e6 Db\u22121 ) = (Dc \u25e6 Dd\u22121 )\u01eb , where\nc = \u03a8# (a) and d = \u03a8# (b). Let a be an element of Vnonsep . Let b\nbe an element of BP a . Then (a, b) is a bounding pair on S. Hence,\n\u03a8(Da \u25e6 Db\u22121 ) = (Dc \u25e6 Dd\u22121)\u01eb and \u03a8(Da \u25e6 Db\u22121) = (De \u25e6 Df\u22121 )\u01eb , where c =\n\u03a8\u2217 (a), d = \u03a8\u2217 (b), e = \u03a8# (a), and f = \u03a8# (b). Note that (Dc \u25e6 Dd\u22121 )\u01eb =\n(De \u25e6 Df# )\u01eb . This implies that (c, d) = (e, f ). Hence, c = e. That is to\nsay, \u03a8\u2217 (a) = \u03a8# (a). Hence, the two functions \u03a8\u2217 : Vnonsep \u2192 Vnonsep\nand \u03a8# : Vnonsep \u2192 Vnonsep are equal.\nThis proves the uniqueness of a function \u03a8\u2217 as described in the first\nclause of Proposition 6.11.\nLet \u0398 : T \u2192 T be the inverse of the automorphism \u03a8 : T \u2192 T .\nClearly, by the definition of the orientation type of an automorphism in\nProposition 4.3 and the definition of the induced map on Vnonsep given\nin the first clause of Proposition 6.11, the induced maps \u03a8\u2217 : Vnonsep \u2192\nVnonsep and \u0398\u2217 : Vnonsep \u2192 Vnonsep are inverse maps. This proves the\nsecond clause of Proposition 6.11.\n\u0003\n7. Induced automorphism of the complex of curves\nIn this section, we extend the automorphism \u03a8\u2217 : Csep \u2192 Csep of\nProposition 5.2 to the entire complex of circles C of S.\nConsider the unique function \u03a8\u2217 : V \u2192 V whose restrictions to Vsep\nand Vnonsep are the functions \u03a8\u2217 : Vsep \u2192 Vsep and \u03a8\u2217 : Vnonsep \u2192\nVnonsep of Propositions 5.1 and 6.11.\nWe shall show that \u03a8\u2217 : V \u2192 V extends to a simplicial map. This\nwill use the following consequence of Proposition 3.1.\nProposition 7.1. Let a be an element of Vnonsep and b be an element\nof \u222b \u2309\u221a. Let c = \u03a8\u2217 (a) and d = \u03a8\u2217 (b). Suppose that a is represented\nby a circle A on S and b is represented by a circle B on S such that\nB is the boundary of an embedded torus P on S and A is contained\nin the interior of P . Then c is represented by a circle C on S and d\nis represented by a circle D on S such that D is the boundary of an\nembedded torus Q on S and C is contained in the interior of Q.\nWe shall now show that \u03a8\u2217 : V \u2192 V extends to a simplicial map\n\u03a8\u2217 : C \u2192 C.\n\nTheorem 7.2. Let \u03a8 : T \u2192 T be an automorphism of T . Let \u03a8\u2217 :\nV \u2192 V be the unique function whose restrictions to Vsep and Vnonsep\nare the functions \u03a8\u2217 : Vsep \u2192 Vsep and \u03a8\u2217 : Vnonsep \u2192 Vnonsep of\nPropositions 5.1 and 6.11. Then \u03a8\u2217 : V \u2192 V extends to a simplicial\nautomorphism \u03a8\u2217 : C \u2192 C of C.\n\n\f26\n\nJ. D. MCCARTHY AND W. R. VAUTAW\n\nProof. Let a and b be distinct elements of V such that i(a, b) = 0. Let\nc = \u03a8\u2217 (a) and d = \u03a8\u2217 (b). It suffices to show that i(c, d) = 0. This will\nfollow by considering several cases.\nSuppose that a and b are both elements of Vsep . Then, by Proposition\n5.2, i(c, d) = 0.\nSuppose, on the other hand, that a and b are both elements of Vnonsep .\nIf (a, b) is a bounding pair, then by Proposition 6.11, (c, d) is a bounding\npair. In particular, i(c, d) = 0. We may assume, therefore, that (a, b)\nis not a bounding pair. Since i(a, b) = 0, this assumption implies that\na is represented by a circle A on S and b is represented by a circle B\non S such that A is disjoint from B and the complement of A \u222a B in\nS is connected. Hence, there exists circles E and F on S such that (i)\nA, B, E, and F are all disjoint, (ii) E and F bound embedded tori PE\nand PF on S, and (iii) A is contained in the interior of PE and B is\ncontained in the interior of PF .\nSince the genus of S is at least 3, E is not isotopic to F . Let e\nand f denote the isotopy classes of E and F . Since E and F are\nseparating circles, e and f are elements of Vsep . Since E and F are\ndisjoint, i(e, f ) = 0. Since E and F are not isotopic, e is not equal to\nf.\nLet g = \u03a8\u2217 (e) and h = \u03a8\u2217 (f ). By Proposition 5.1, since e and f\nare distinct elements of Vsep , g and h are distinct elements of Vsep . By\nProposition 5.2, since i(e, f ) = 0, we have i(g, h) = 0.\nBy Proposition 7.1, c and g are represented by circles C and G on S\nsuch that G bounds an embedded torus QG on S and C is contained\nin the interior of QG . Likewise, d and h are represented by circles D\nand H on S such that H bounds an embedded torus QH on S and D\nis contained in the interior of QH .\nSince i(g, h) = 0, we may assume that G and H are disjoint. Since\ng is not equal to h, G is not isotopic to H. Hence, the interiors of the\nembedded tori, QG and QH , bounded by G and H are disjoint. This\nimplies that C and D are disjoint. Hence, i(c, d) = 0.\nThus, if a and b are both elements of Vnonsep , then i(c, d) = 0.\nSuppose, finally, that one of a and b is an element of Vnonsep and one\nis an element of Vsep . We may assume that a is an element of Vnonsep\nand b is an element of Vsep . Since i(a, b) = 0, a is represented by a\ncircle A on S and b is represented by a circle B on S such that A and\nB are disjoint. Since b is in Vsep , B bounds an embedded surface PB in\nS such that A is contained in the interior of PB . PB is the closure of\nthe unique component of the complement of B in S which contains A.\nLet k be the genus of PB . Since B is an essential circle on S, k > 0.\nIf k = 1, then by Proposition 7.1, i(c, d) = 0. Hence, we may assume\n\n\fAUTOMORPHISMS OF TORELLI GROUPS\n\n27\n\nthat k > 1. It follows that there exists a circle E on S such that (i)\nA, B, and E are disjoint, (ii) E bounds an embedded torus PE on S\nsuch that PE is contained in the interior of PB and A is contained in\nthe interior of PE . Note that E is not isotopic to B.\nLet e denote the isotopy class of E on S. Let f = \u03a8\u2217 (e). Since B and\nE are nonisotopic disjoint essential separating circles on S, it follows, by\nPropositions 5.1 and 5.2, that d and f are distinct elements of Vsep such\nthat i(d, f ) = 0. Hence, d and f are represented by nonisotopic disjoint\nessential separating circles, D and F , on S. Hence, by Proposition\n7.1, it follows that c is represented by a circle C on S such that C is\ncontained in the interior of an embedded torus PF on S with boundary\nF . Since D and F are disjoint nonisotopic essential separating circles\non S, it follows that D is contained in the complement of PF . Since C\nis contained in the interior of PF , it follows that C and D are disjoint.\nHence, i(c, d) = 0.\n\u0003\n\nReferences\n[B]\n[BLM]\n[DG]\n[EE]\n[F]\n[FIv]\n[FLP]\n\n[I]\n\n[IIvM]\n[Iv1]\n\n[Iv2]\n\nJ.
