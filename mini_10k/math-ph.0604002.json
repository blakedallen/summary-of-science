This is perhaps also the reason why unitary irreducible representations of the Poincar\u00e9 group \u2013 the symmetry group of special\ntheory of relativity \u2013 has been known nearly twenty years earlier than those of the\nGalilei group, even though the Galilei principle of relativity was discovered several\ncenturies prior to the Einstein one.\nThe Galilei group and its representations are described in the L\u00e9vy-Leblond masterful survey [1] written almost thirty five years ago. They form the group-theoretical\nbasis for description of various physical predictions in non-relativistic classical mechanics and electrodynamics and in non-relativistic quantum mechanics as well (see\nalso a more recent review [2]) . These predictions are generally more than just some\napproximations to the relativistic results since only comparison of the predictions\nbased on the Galilei group and its representations with those on the Poincar\u00e9 group\ncan indicate which predictions have the origin in the non-relativistic and which in the\nrelativistic one. For instance, it was shown in [3], [4] and by L\u00e9vy-Leblond in [1], [5],\n[6] that the concept of spin of particles and of magnetic moments of particles have the\norigin already in the Galilean non-relativistic quantum mechanics and not as stated\nin many textbooks as a consequence of relativistic effects.\nIn the Galilei invariant framework we shall consider first free particles and then\nparticles interacting with external fields. The free particles can be described either\nby representations of the Galilei group (irreducible in the case of elementary particles and indecomposable for particles with internal structures) or equivalently, by\nGalilean invariant wave equations. For interacting particles the wave equations are\nmore appropriate since they allow to introduce interactions.\nThere exist three approaches how to formulate the Galilei invariant wave equations. The first is based on the fact that the Galilei group and the Galilei invariant\nequations can be obtained from the Poincar\u00e9 group and Poincar\u00e9 invariant equations\nrespectively by a limiting procedure \u2013 the so-called Inon\u00fc-Wigner contraction [7].\nThe second approach consists of writing first the Lorentz-invariant equations in\nthe (4 + 1)-dimensional space-time, and then projecting them down to the (3 + 1)dimensional Newtonian space-time using the fact that the extended Galilei algebra in\n(3 + 1) dimensions is a subalgebra of the Poincar\u00e9 algebra in (4 + 1) dimensions, for\nconnection of representations of these algebras see [8]. This approach, referred here\nas a projecting one, has been developed in [9]-[11] (see also [12]).\nThe third way to construct Galilei invariant theories consists in searching for this\ntheories directly using the requirement of Galilei invariance and knowledge of representations of the Galilei group. We shall show in this paper that, in many respects,\nthis latest approach is the most powerful and comprehensive. Moreover, it allows us\nto construct such consistent Galilei-invariant equations of motion which are very dif1\n\n\fficult to derive using the contraction or projection methods. On the other hand, the\ndirect search for wave equations invariant with respect to the inhomogeneous Galilei\ngroup presupposes a good knowledge of the indecomposable finite-dimensional representations of its homogeneous Galilei subgroup, which has not been available till\nnow.\nOur article serves the following four aims: (1) to describe all indecomposable\nfinite-dimensional representations of the homogeneous Galilei group that are defined\non spinor, scalar and vector representation spaces; (2) to specify all Galilei invariant\nbilinear forms, which facilitate derivation of various non-linear Galilei wave equations;\n(3) to specify the reducible representations of the Lorentz group which lead to the\nfound representations of the Galilei group via contractions; (4) to determine the\nGalilean spinorial wave equations which include the Pauli anomalous terms.\nIn the next section we define indecomposable finite-dimensional representations\nof the homogeneous Galilei group in general.\nIn Sections 3 and 4 some of these representations are constructed explicitly, namely\nall those which when restricted to representations of the rotation subgroup of the\nhomogeneous Galilei group are decomposed to spin 0, 1/2 and 1 representations. In\naddition we present here also the complete list of bilinear forms invariant with respect\nto all found representations of the Galilei group. Section 5 contains various examples\nof the Galilean vectors. In Section 6 we obtain the previously found representations of\nthe homogeneous Galilei group via the In\u00f6n\u00fc-Wigner contraction of the corresponding\nrepresentations of the Lorentz group. In Section 7 the found representations are used\nto deduce the most general form of the Pauli interaction term which can be added to\nthe Galilei invariant equation for spinors. Subsection 7.3 presents a simple Galilean\nsystem which describes the Darwin and spin-orbital interactions of particles with an\nexternal electric field. Finally, Section 8 is devoted to discussions of the obtained\nresults.\n\n2\n\nDefinitions and properties of the Galilei group\nand its Lie algebra\n\nThe Galilei group G(1, 3) consists of the following transformations of time variable t\nand of space variables x = (x1 , x2 , x3 ):\nt \u2192 t\u2032 = t + a,\nx \u2192 x\u2032 = Rx + vt + b\n\n(1)\n\nwhere a, b and v are real parameters of time translation, space translations and pure\nGalilei transformations respectively, and matrix R specifies rotations determined by\nthe three parameters \u03b81 , \u03b82 , \u03b83 .\nThe Galilei group includes a subgroup leaving invariant a point x = (0, 0, 0) at\ntime t = 0. It is formed by all space rotations and pure Galilei transformations, i.e.,\n2\n\n\fby transformations (1) with a = b \u2261 0. This subgroup is said to be the homogeneous\nGalilei group HG(1, 3). It is a semi-direct product of the three-parameter commutative group of pure Galilei transformations with the rotation group. Thus this group\nis not compact and does not have unitary finite-dimensional representations.\nThe Galilei group G(1, 3) is a semidirect product of its Abelian subgroup generated\nby time and space translations with the homogeneous Galilei group HG(1, 3) .\nUnitary representations of Galilei group which are ordinary ones were described\nby In\u00f6n\u00fc and Wigner [3] in 1952, whereas those which are ray by Bargmann [4] in\n1954. A nice review of these representations can be found in [1], see also [13].\nHowever, a decisive role in the description of various finite-component Galilei\ninvariant equations is played by finite-dimensional representations of the homogeneous\nGalilei group HG(1, 3). They where studied first apparently in paper [14] but have\nnot been classified till now.\nLet us remind that the representations of HG(1, 3) induce ray representations of\nthe Galilei group G(1, 3) as well as ordinary representations of the extended Galilei\ngroup Gm (1, 3) which is a central extension of the Galilei group via a one-parameter\nsubgroup. Both of them are realized in the space of (square integrable) n-component\nfunctions \u03a8(t, x) which for any transformation (1) cotransform in the following way\n[1]\n\u03a8(x, t) \u2192 \u03a8\u2032 (x\u2032 , t\u2032 ) = eif (x,t) T \u03a8(x, t)\n(2)\nwhere \u03a8(x, t) = column(\u03a81 (x, t), \u03a82 (x, t), * * * , \u03a8n (x, t)) are n-component vectors from\nthe representation space, T are n\u00d7n numerical matrices depending on transformation\nparameters v and \u03b8 = (\u03b81 , \u03b82 , \u03b83 ),\nv2\nf (x, t) = m v * x + t + c\n2\n\n!\n\nis a phase which includes two parameters: m and c. For m = 0 the central extension\nis trivial and representations (2) are ordinary representations of G(1, 3). For m different from zero the central extension is nontrivial, and transformations (2) realize ray\nrepresentations of the Galilei group G(1, 3) and ordinary representations of Gm (1, 3).\nMoreover, the transformation matrices T realize a finite-dimensional representations\nof the homogeneous Galilei group HG(1, 3).\nLet us mention that realizations (2) are precisely those which are used in quantum\nmechanics and quantum field theory. These realizations are also essential to construct\nwave equations invariant w.r.t. the Galilei group [12].\nTaking expressions (2) corresponding to the infinitesimal transformations (1) and\ntreating c as an additional transformation parameter we can calculate the 11-dimensional\nLie algebra of the extended Galilei group. Basis elements of this algebra are of the\nfollowing form\nP0 = i\u22020 , Pa = \u2212i\u2202a , M = Im\nJa = \u2212i\u03b5abc xb \u2202c + Sa ,\n(3)\nKa = \u2212ix0 \u2202a \u2212 mxa + \u03b7a ,\n3\n\n\fwhere indices a, b and c run over the values 1, 2, 3, I is the unit matrix, and Sa and\n\u03b7a are matrices which satisfy the following commutation relations:\n[Sa , Sb ] = i\u03b5abc Sc ,\n\n(4)\n\n[\u03b7a , Sb ] = i\u03b5abc \u03b7c ,\n\n(5)\n\n[\u03b7a , \u03b7b ] = 0,\n\n(6)\n\nthat is, they form a basis of the Lie algebra hg(1, 3) of the homogeneous Galilei group\nHG(1, 3). This algebra is isomorphic to the Lie algebra hg(1, 3) of the Euclidean\ngroup.\nConditions (4) \u2013 (6) are necessary and sufficient in order generators (3) form a\nbasis of a Lie algebra namely the extended Galilei algebra satisfying the following\nrelations:\n[Ja , Jb ] = i\u01ebabc Jc ,\n[Ja , Kb ] = i\u01ebabc Kc ,\n[Ja , Pb ] = i\u01ebabc Pc ,\n[Ka , P0 ] = iPa ,\n[Ka , Pb ] = i\u03b4ab M,\n[Ka , Kb ] = 0,\n(7)\n[Pa , Pb] = 0,\n[P0 , Pa ] = 0,\n[M, P0 ] = [M, Pa ] = [M, Ja ] = [M, Ka ] = 0.\nUnfortunately, the problem of a complete classification of non-equivalent finitedimensional realizations of algebra (4)-(6) appears to be an unsolvable 'wild' algebraic\nproblem. However we shall show that this problem can be completely solved in\nthe two important particular cases: for the purely spinor representations and vector\nrepresentations.\n\n3\n\nSpinor representations\n\nThe Lie algebra hg(1, 3), defined by relations (4)-(6), includes the subalgebra so(3)\nspanned on the basis elements S1 , S2 and S3 . Without loss of generality we suppose\nthat representations of this subalgebra are Hermitian and completely reducible and\nshall search for representations of hg(1, 3) in the so(3) basis in which the Casimir\noperator of so(3) is diagonal.\nIrreducible representations of so(3) are labelled by integers or half-integers s. Let\ns\u0303 be the highest value of s which appears in the decomposition of a reducible representation of so(3) subduced by the indecomposable representation of hg(1, 3). We\nshall call the related carrier space of this representation of hg(1, 3) the representation\nspace of spin s\u0303.\nConsider finite-dimensional indecomposable representations of algebra hg(1, 3) of\nspin s\u0303 = 12 .

The commutativity of matrices (9) leads to the\nnilpotency condition\nA2n\u00d7n = 0.\n(10)\nThus, without any loss of generality, An\u00d7n may be expressed as a direct sum of 2 \u00d7 2\nJordan cells and zero matrix.\nBecause of (10) there exist only two different indecomposable representations of\nalgebra hg(1, 3) defined on spin 1/2 carrier space:\n1\nSa = \u03c3a ,\n2\nand\n\n1\nSa =\n2\n\n\u03c3a 0\n0 \u03c3a\n\n!\n\n\u03b7a = 0,\n1\n\u03b7a =\n2\n\n,\n\n0 0\n\u03c3a 0\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(11)\n\nThe corresponding vectors from the representation space are !\ntwo-component spinors\n\u03c61 (x, t)\n\u03c6(x, t), as well as four-component bispinors \u03a8 =\nwith two-component\n\u03c62 (x, t)\n\u03c61 and \u03c62 , respectively.

Namely, if we multiply equation (16) by A and use equation (17),\nthen we obtain the condition A3 = 0 so that A is a nilpotent matrix whose nilpotency\nindex N satisfies the condition N \u2264 3. This implies that BC is a nilpotent matrix\nwith index of nilpotency equal to 2. Thus A can be represented as a direct sum of the\n6\n\n\fJordan cells of dimension 3, 2 and zero matrices. We can prove that in order to obtain\nindecomposable representations of algebra (4), (6) it is necessary to restrict ourselves\nto the case of the indecomposable matrices A, and so there are three possibilities\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n0 0 0\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\nA = \uf8ed 1 0 0 \uf8f8, A =\n0 1 0\n\n0 0\n1 0\n\n!\n\n, A = 0.\n\n(18)\n\nWe can prove that for indecomposable matrices \u03b7 dimension m and dimension n\nsatisfy the condition \u22121 \u2264 (n \u2212 m) \u2264 2, n \u2264 3.

The complete list of various vectors\nwhich can be formed using components of F\u03bc\u03bd is present in Section 5.\nExample 4. As another example of a Galilean field can be considered the matrix\n5-vector D5 = (\u03c8, U1 , U2 , U3 , C) with components\n\u221a\n\u03c8 = \u03b20 = \u221a2(\u03b30 + \u03b34 ),\n(35)\nC = \u03b24 = 2(\u03b30 \u2212 \u03b34 ),\nUa = \u03b2a = \u03b3a\n11\n\n\fwhere \u03b3\u03bc are Dirac matrices, \u03bc = 0, . . . , 4, a = 1, 2, 3. Such set of matrices commutes\nas a 5-vector with the Galilei generators (3) if we choose\nSa = 41 \u03b5abc \u03b3b \u03b3c ,\n\u03b7a = 2\u221a1 2 (\u03b30 + \u03b34 ) \u03b3a .\n\n(36)\n\nExample 5. As in the two previous examples, the matrix tensor\nS\u03bc\u03bd = \u03b2\u03bc \u03b2\u03bd \u2212 \u03b2\u03bd \u03b2\u03bc\n\n(37)\n\ntransforms like F\u03bc\u03bd , that is, as a 10-vector. Moreover, it is possible to form the\nfollowing matrix vectors:\n\u03a8\u03034 : (R\n\u0011\n\u0010 a = S4a , B = S40 ) ,\n\u03a8\u03036 : Va = 21 \u03b5abc Sbc , Wa = S4a ,\n\n\u03a8\u03037 :\n\n6\n\n\u0010\n\nKa = S0a , Ra =\n\n1\n\u03b5 S ,\n2 abc bc\n\n(38)\n\u0011\n\nA = S40 .\n\nContractions of representations of Lorentz algebra\n\nIt is well known that the Galilei group (algebra) and (some of) its representations\ncan be obtained from the Poincar\u00e9 group (algebra) and from its appropriate representations by a limiting procedure called \"contraction\". The process of contraction\nhas, by now, an extensive literature. First it was proposed by Segal [18] and in more\nspecific forms by In\u00f6n\u00fc and Wigner [7], by Saletan [19], by Doebner and Melsheimer\n[20] and many others, see the excellent review article of L\u00f4hmus [21] and references\ncited therein, a more recent review can be found in [22].\nThe Lie algebra of a given Lie group is defined via commutation relations for basis elements. As shown by Cartan, whenever we change the basis by a non-singular\ntransformation we come to algebra isomorphic to the original one. However, if the\ntransformation is singular, a new algebra may be received, provided this transformation leads to well defined commutation relations for the transformed basis elements.\nIn the simplest case a contraction is a limit procedure which transforms an Ndimensional Lie algebra L into an non-isomorphic Lie algebra L\u2032 , also with N dimensions. The commutation relations of a contracted Lie algebra L\u2032 are given by:\n[x, y]\u2032 \u2261 lim W\u03b5\u22121 ([W\u03b5 (x), W\u03b5 (y)],\n\u03b5\u2192\u03b50\n\n(39)\n\nwhere W\u03b5 \u2208 GL(N, k) is a non-singular linear transformation of L, with \u03b50 being a\nsingularity point of its inverse W\u03b5\u22121 .\nThe papers [18]-[22] indicate different ways of performing this (and more general)\nsingular transformation and necessary and sufficient conditions that a given Lie algebra can be contracted into another one. However there is no a regular way to obtain\n12\n\n\frepresentations of the contracted algebra starting with the representations of the initial one. Namely, in contracting representations we meet the following difficulties of\nprinciple:\ni) Contracting the faithful representation of a given Lie algebra we obtain in general a non-faithful representation of the resulting Lie algebra since a part of generators\nis represented trivially.\nii) The resulting (contracted) algebra is always non-compact. Hence any contraction of a Hermitian irreducible representation of some compact Lie algebra, which is\nalways finite-dimensional, has to yield at the end to an infinite-dimensional Hermitian\nirreducible representation of the non-compact Lie algebra.\nIn\u00f6n\u00fc and Wigner in [7] mentioned possible ways of treating the difficulties (for\ndetails see paper [23] where contraction of representations of the de Sitter group was\ncarried out), one of them will be used in what follows.\nThere is a simple contractions procedure (the In\u00f6n\u00fc-Wigner contraction) connecting the Lie algebra so(1, 3) of Lorentz group with algebra hg(1, 3). The related\ntransformation W does not change basis elements of so(1, 3) forming its subalgebra\nso(3) while the remaining basis elements are multiplied by a small parameter \u03b5 which\ntends to zero [7].\nHere we find representations of the Lorentz group whose contraction makes it\npossible to obtain found realizations of homogeneous Galilei group. A specific feature\nof these representations is that they are in general case completely reducible while\nthe corresponding contracted representations of Galilei algebra are indecomposable\nones.\nLet S\u03bc\u03bd , \u03bc, \u03bd = 0, 1, 2, 3 are matrices realizing a representation of the Lorentz\nalgebra, i.e., satisfying the relations\n[S\u03bc\u03bd , S\u03bb\u03c3 ] = i(g\u03bc\u03bb S\u03bd\u03c3 + g\u03bd\u03c3 S\u03bc\u03bb \u2212 g\u03bd\u03bb S\u03bc\u03c3 \u2212 g\u03bc\u03c3 S\u03bd\u03bb )\n\n(40)\n\nwith g\u03bc\u03bd = diag(1, \u22121, \u22121, \u22121). The contraction procedure consists in transition to\na new basis\nSab \u2192 Sab , S0a \u2192 \u03b5S0a\n\n\u2032\nand simultaneous transformation of all basis elements S\u03bc\u03bd \u2192 S\u03bc\u03bd\n= US\u03bc\u03bd U \u22121 with a\nmatrix U depending on \u03b5. Moreover, u should depend on \u03b5 in a tricky way, such that\n\u2032\nall the transformed generators S\u03bc\u03bd\nare kept non-trivial when \u03b5 \u2192 0 [7].\nWe suppose that representations obtained by the contraction are indecomposable\nrepresentations D(n, m, \u03bb) described in Section 4. To construct representations of\nLorentz algebra which can be contracted to representations D(n, m, \u03bb) we use the\nfollowing observation.\nLemma Let {Sa , \u03b7a } be an indecomposable set of matrices realizing one of representations D(1, 1, 0), D(1, 1, 1), D(1, 2, 1), D(2, 0, 0) or D(3, 1, 1) presented in Table\n1. Then matrices\nSab = \u03b5abs Sc , S0a = \u03bd(\u03b7a \u2212 \u03b7a\u2020 )\n(41)\n\n13\n\n\fwhere \u03bd = 1 for representations D(1, 1, 0), D(1, 1, 1) D(2, 0, 0) and \u03bd = \u221a12 for representations D(1, 2, 1), D(3, 1, 1), form a basis of the Lie algebra of Lorentz group.\nThe proof is reduced to the direct verification, that for all basis elements Sa , \u03b7a of\nhomogeneous Galilei algebra the corresponding linear combinations (41) satisfy the\nrelations (40), i.e., do form a basis of the Lorentz algebra.\nFor representations D(1, 0, 0), (D(2, 1, 1), D(2, 1, 0)) and D(2, 2, 1) the related matrices (41) do not form a basis of Lie algebra. Nevertheless it is possible to find\nthe corresponding generators of the Lorentz algebra starting with its known representations of dimension 3 \u00d7 3, 7 \u00d7 7 and 8 \u00d7 8 correspondingly. We choose these\nrepresentations in the following forms:\nSab = \u03b5abc sc , S0a = isa ,\n\n(42)\n\n\u221a\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nisa\n\u2212sa i \u221a2ka\u2020\nsc 03\u00d73 03\u00d71\n1\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\u2020 \uf8f7\nSab = \u03b5abc \uf8ed 03\u00d73 sc 03\u00d71 \uf8f8 , S0a = \uf8ed \u221asa\n\u221aisa \u2212 2ka \uf8f8 ,\n2\n01\u00d73 01\u00d73\n0\ni 2ka\n2ka\n0\n\uf8eb\n\nand\n\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\nSab = \u03b5abc \uf8ec\n\nsc 03\u00d73 03\u00d71 03\u00d71\n03\u00d73 sc 03\u00d71 03\u00d71\n01\u00d73 01\u00d73\n0\n0\n01\u00d73 01\u00d73\n0\n0\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7,\n\uf8f8\n\nS0a =\n\n\uf8eb\n\n1\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n2\uf8ed\n\n(43)\n\nisa \u2212sa ika\u2020 ka\u2020\nsa\nisa \u2212ka\u2020 ika\u2020 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\nika ka\n0\n0 \uf8f8\n\u2212ka ika\n0\n0\n\uf8f6\n\n(44)\n\nwhere sa and ka are matrices given by equations (13) and (15).\nMatrices (41)-(44) form basises of representations of Lorentz algebra which are\nin general reducible. These representations (together with the related realizations of\nhomogeneous Galilei algebra given in Table 1) are enumerated in Table 2.\nThus we obtain the indecomposable representations of the Lie algebra of the homogeneous Galilei group starting with finite-dimension representations of the Lorentz\nalgebra so(1, 3) and applying the contraction procedure. Special features of this approach are summarized at the following items.\n\u2022 To obtain indecomposable representations of algebra hg(1, 3) found in Section\n4 we were supposed to use completely reducible representations of the Lorentz\nalgebra.\n\u2022 It is possible to obtain different non-equivalent realizations of hg(1, 3) starting\nwith a given representation of so(1, 3). For example, both realizations D7 and\nD8 can be obtained via contractions of the representation D( 12 , 12 ) \u2295 D(1, 0).\n\u2022 It is possible to obtain a given representation of hg(1, 3) via contraction of different representations of so(1, 3). For example, above mentioned representation\nD( 12 , 21 ) \u2295 D(1, 0) can be replaced by D( 12 , 12 ) \u2295 D(0, 1), or, more generally, any\nrepresentation D(m, n) of so(1, 3) can be replaced by D(n, m).\n14\n\n\fRepresentation\nof algebra hg(1, 3)\n\nRepresentations\nof algebra so(1, 3)\n\nD(1, 0, 0)\n\nD(1, 0)\n\nD(1, 1, 0)\n\nD( 12 , 12 )\n\nD(1, 1, 1)\n\nD( 12 , 12 )\n\nD(1, 2, 1)\n\nD(2, 0, 0)\n\nD(2, 1, 0)\n\nD(2, 1, 1)\n\nD(2, 2, 1)\n\nD(3, 1, 1)\n\nBasis\nelements\nS\u03bc\u03bd\n(42)\n\nD( 21 , 12 ) \u2295 D(0, 0)\n\nContracting matrix U\n\nI3\u00d73\n\n(41)\n\nI3\u00d73 03\u00d71\n01\u00d73 \u03b5\u22121\n\n!\n\n(41)\n\nI3\u00d73 03\u00d71\n01\u00d73\n\u03b5\n\n!\n\nI3\u00d73 03\u00d71 03\u00d71\n\uf8ec\n\u03b5\n0 \uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\uf8ed 01\u00d73\n01\u00d73\n0\n\u03b5\u22121\n\n(41)\n\nD(0, 1) \u2295 D(1, 0)\n\nI3\u00d73\n03\u00d73\n03\u00d73 \u03b5\u22121 I3\u00d73\n\n(41)\n\nD( 21 , 12 ) \u2295 D(1, 0)\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8eb\n\n(44)\n\nD(0, 1) \u2295 D(1, 0)\n\u2295D( 21 , 21 )\n\n(41)\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\nI3\u00d73\n03\u00d73\n03\u00d71 03\u00d71\n\u22121\n03\u00d73 \u03b5 I3\u00d73 01\u00d73 01\u00d73\n01\u00d73\n01\u00d73\n1\n0\n01\u00d73\n01\u00d73\n0\n\u03b5\u22121\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\nI3\u00d73\n03\u00d73\n03\u00d73\n03\u00d71\n03\u00d73 \u03b5\u22121 I3\u00d73\n03\u00d73\n03\u00d71\n\u22122\n03\u00d73\n03\u00d73\n\u03b5 I3\u00d73 03\u00d71\n01\u00d73\n01\u00d73\n01\u00d73\n\u03b5\u22121\n\nTable 2: Representations of Lorentz algebra and contracting matrices\n\n15\n\n\uf8f6\n\nI3\u00d73 03\u00d73 03\u00d71\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed 03\u00d73 \u03b5I3\u00d73 03\u00d71 \uf8f8\n01\u00d73 01\u00d73\n\u03b5\n\n(43)\n\nD( 21 , 21 )\u2295\nD(0, 0) \u2295 D(0, 0)\n\n!\n\nI3\u00d73\n03\u00d73\n03\u00d71\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed 03\u00d73 \u03b5\u22121 I3\u00d73 03\u00d71 \uf8f8\n01\u00d73\n01\u00d73\n\u03b5\u22121\n\n(43)\n\nD( 21 , 12 ) \u2295 D(1, 0)\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n\f7\n\nGalilean linear spin one-half wave equation with\nPauli anomalous interaction\n\nThe completed list of indecomposable spinor and vector representations of algebra\nhg(1, 3) found in Section 3 and 4 can be used to construct Galilei invariant models\nfor spinorial and vector fields both linear and nonlinear ones. In particular these\nrepresentations can be applied to derive systems of equations invariant with respect\nto Galilei group.\nIn this section we apply them to describe possible Pauli type interactions for spinor\nfield invariant with respect to Galilei group.\n\n7.1\n\nReduction approach\n\nConsider the Dirac equation describing a fermionic field \u03a8(x) coupled to a gauge field\nA\u03bc , and a Pauli anomalous term :\n(\u03b3\u03bc \u03c0 \u03bc + k[\u03b3 \u03bc , \u03b3 \u03bd ]F\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 \u03bb) \u03a8(x) = 0,\n\n(45)\n\nwhere\n\u03c0\u03bc \u2261 p\u03bc \u2212 qA\u03bc ,\nand the second term is the Pauli anomalous term.\nA natural way to construct a Galilean analogue of equation (45) is to generalize\nit to the case of (4, 1)-dimensional space and then make the reduction discussed in\nSection 1. However in this case it is desirable to present a clear physical interpretation\nfor all values obtained by the reduction. In addition, in this way we cannot obtain\nthe most general Pauli interaction term. Thus we consider two possibilities: the\nreduction of equation defined in (4, 1)-dimensional space and a direct search for Pauli\nterm invariant under the Galilei group.\nIn order to perform the reduction, it is sufficient to change in (45) the Dirac\nmatrices to their Galilean analogues, i.e., to change \u03b3\u03bc \u2192 \u03b2\u03bc where \u03b2\u03bc are defined by\nrelations (35). In particular they may be chosen as [24]\n!\n!\n\u221a !\na\n0\n0\n\u03c3\n0\n0\n2\n0\n4\na\n\u221a\n\u03b2 =\n,\n\u03b2 =\n,\n\u03b2 =\n.\n(46)\na\n0 \u2212\u03c3\n\u2212 2 0\n0 0\nIf we substitute these matrices into equation (45) for \u03c8 =\n\n\u03c6\n\u03c7\n\n!\n\n(where \u03c6 and \u03c7 are\n\ntwo component spinors) and use the notations (33), we find\n\u221a\n(\u03c3\n\u221a * \u03c0 \u2212 \u03bb + 4ik\u03c3 * W + 4kB]\u03c6 + 2 (\u03c04 + 4k\u03b8 * R)\u03c7 = 0,\n2 (\u03c00 \u2212 4k\u03c3 * N)\u03c6 + (\u03c3 * \u03c0 + \u03bb \u2212 4ik\u03c3 * W + 4kB)\u03c7 = 0\n\n16\n\n(47)\n\n\fwhere \u03c04 = m \u2212 qA4 . Solving the first of equations (47) for \u03c7 and substituting the\nsolution into the second line we come to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation with spin dependent\npotential which is not discussed here.\nIn the magnetic limit, defined as in reference [17]:\n(Am , \u03c6m ) \u0592\u2192 Am = (A0 , Am , A4 ) = (\u2212\u03c6m , Am , 0) ,\nwe find\n\n(48)\n\nBm = W = \u2207\u00d7Am ,\nEm = N = \u2212\u2207\u03c6m \u2212 \u2202t Am .\n\nNote that R = 0 and B = 0, and Galilei transformations for Am , \u03c6m , Bm and Em\nhave the form\nAm \u2192 Am ,\n\u03c6m \u2192 \u03c6m \u2212 v * A m ,\n(49)\nBm \u2192 Bm ,\nEm \u2192 Em + v \u00d7 Bm .\n\nWith these definitions, equation (47) becomes\n\u221a\n(\u03c3\n*\n(\u03c0\n\u2212\nqA\n)\n\u2212\n\u03bb\n+\n4ik\u03c3\n*\nB\n)\u03c6\n+\n2 m\u03c7 = 0,\nm\nm\n\u221a\n2 (p0 + q\u03c6m \u2212 4k\u03c3 * Em )\u03c6 + [\u03c3 * (\u03c0 \u2212 qAm ) + \u03bb \u2212 4ik\u03c3 * Bm ]\u03c7 = 0.\nThis may be rewritten as\n[\u03b3\u03bc \u03c0 \u03bc \u2212 \u03bb + 2k (S * Bm + \u03b7 * Em )] \u03c8 = 0\n\n(50)\n\nwhere S and \u03b7 are matrix vectors whose components are given in equation (36).\nThus we obtain in rather elegant way equation (50) which is manifestly Galilei\ninvariant and describes both the minimal and anomalous couplings of particle of spin\n1/2 with an external Galilean electromagnetic field of magnetic type. In the case\nk = 0, i.e., when only the minimal interaction is present, this equation is reduced\nto the L\u00e9vy-Leblond equation. However, it presents only one of many possibilities\nto introduce anomalous coupling into the L\u00e9vy-Leblond equation. A more general\napproach is presented in the following subsection.\n\n7.2\n\nDirect approach\n\nAnomalous Pauli interaction is represented in equation (45) by the term k[\u03b3\u03bc , \u03b3\u03bd ]F \u03bc\u03bd ,\nwhich is linear with respect to the electromagnetic field strength F . It is possible to\nshow that the requirement of relativistic invariance defines this term in a unique way\n(up to a value of the coupling constant k).\nIn contrast with the above, in the Galilei-invariant approach there are more possibilities to introduce the anomalous interaction. In this subsection we use our knowledge of Galilean vector field (refer to Section 4) to find the most general form of\nanomalous interaction for Galilean spinors.\nFirst we remind that there exist two types of massless Galilean 4-vector fields,\ni.e., \u03a84 and \u03a8\u03034 , whose transformation properties are defined by equations (22) and\n17\n\n\f(23) with m = 0, and a 5-vector \u03a85 which transforms as given in (31). In other\nwords we have three types of potentials of external vector field which can be used\nto introduce the minimal interaction into the L\u00e9vy-Leblond equation. And they are\npotentials which generate field strengthes involved into anomalous interaction terms\nwhose examples are present in the previous subsection.\nWe notice that in addition it is possible to introduce minimal and anomalous\ninteractions with fields whose potentials are three-vectors or scalars. Moreover, the\nGalilei invariance condition admits some constrains for the potentials which generate\nadditional possible anomalous interactions.\nLet us start with the vector \u03a8\u03034 which corresponds to the magnetic limit field\nconsidered in the previous section, and find the most general Galilean scalar matrix\nF linear in Bm and Em . Expanding F via the complete set of matrices \u03b2\u03bc (35) and\nS\u03bc\u03bd (37) with well defined transformation properties and using (49) we easily find\nthat F = 2k (S * Bm + \u03b7 * Em ) + g\u03b7 * Bm where k and g are arbitrary parameters. In\nother words, we come to the following Galilei-invariant equation for spinor field with\nthe minimal and anomalous interaction:\n[\u03b3\u03bc \u03c0 \u03bc \u2212 \u03bb + 2k (S * Bm + \u03b7 * Em ) + g\u03b7 * Bm ] \u03c8 = 0.\n\n(51)\n\nIn contrast with (50), equation (51) includes two coupling constants, k and g.\nThe other Galilean limit, named 'electric limit' [6] for the electromagnetic field\ncorresponds to the gauge fields of type \u03a84 , i.e., the related vector-potential\n(Ae , \u03c6e ) \u0592\u2192 Ae = (A0 , A, A4 ) = (0, Ae , \u03c6e ) ,\n\n(52)\n\nand field strengthes Be = \u2207 \u00d7 Ae , Ee = \u2212\u2207\u03c6e , \u03a6 = \u22020 \u03c6 transform as\nAe \u2192 Ae + v\u03c6e ,\n\u03c6e \u2192 \u03c6e\nEe \u2192 Ee ,\nBe \u2192 Be \u2212 v \u00d7 Ee , \u03a6 \u2192 \u03a6 \u2212 v * Ee .\n\n(53)\n\nSearching for the related Galilean Dirac equation with general Pauli interaction\nterm and using the fact that the vectors (Be , \u2212Ee ) have the same transformation\nproperties as (Em , Bm ) we conclude that to achieve our goal it is sufficient to change\nEm \u2192 Be and Bm \u2192 \u2212Ee in (51) and add the additional invariant term \u03b30 \u03a6 + \u03b3 * Ee .\nIn addition, to keep the Galilei invariance we should introduce the minimal interaction\nin the following manner:\n\u03c00 = i\u22020 ,\n\u03c0a = \u2212i\u2202a \u2212 q(Ae )a ,\n\u03c04 = m + q\u03c6e\nAs a result we obtain\n(\u03b3\u03bc \u03c0 \u03bc \u2212 \u03bb + 2k (\u03b7 * Be \u2212 S * Ee ) + g\u03b7 * Ee + r(\u03b30\u03c6e + \u03b3 * Ee )) \u03c8 = 0.\n\n(54)\n\nThus there exist at least two ways to describe anomalous interaction in the Galilei\ninvariant approach, presented by equations (51) and (54). Equation (51) includes two\ncoupling constants while in (54) the number of such constants is equal to 3.\n18\n\n\fNote that transformation laws (49) enable to impose in (51) the Galilei-invariant\ncondition Am = 0 on the vector-potential. Thus there exist one more Galilei-invariant\nequation with anomalous interaction, namely\n[\u03b30 (p0 + q\u03c6) \u2212 \u03b3 * p \u2212 \u03b34 m + 2k\u03b7 * \u2207\u03c6] \u03c8 = 0.\n\n(55)\n\nAnalogously, starting with (54) taking into account that transformations (53) are\ncompatible with the condition \u03c6e = 0 we come to one more Galilei invariant equation\nwith Pauli interaction term, namely\n(\u03b30 \u22020 \u2212 \u03b3 * \u03c0 \u2212 \u03b34 m \u2212 \u03bb + g\u03b7 * B) \u03c8 = 0,\n\n(56)\n\nwhere \u03c0 = \u2212i\u2207 \u2212 qA, B = \u2207 \u00d7 A.\nGauge invariant fields E = \u2212\u2207\u03c6 and B = \u2207 \u00d7 A present in equations (55) and\n(56) can be interpreted as external electric and magnetic fields.\nConsider also the case when the potential of external field form a 5-vector, and\nrelated field strengthes are given by formulae (32)-(34). We will not discuss possible\nphysical interpretation of the corresponding ten-component vector field but mention\nthat there exist a formal possibility to introduce the anomalous interaction with it\nby generalizing the Galilean Dirac equation to the following one:\n(\u03b3 \u03bc \u03c0\u03bc + k[\u03b3 \u03bc , \u03b3 \u03bd ]F\u03bc\u03bd + g\u03b7a Ra + r(Sa Ra + \u03b7a Ua ) \u2212 \u03bb) \u03a8(x) = 0,\n\n(57)\n\nwith three coupling constants k, g r additional to q.\nLike equation (45) with \u03b3-matrices (46), equation (57) is Galilei-invariant but is\nquite more general.\nFinally let the external field is defined by a five-vector potential satisfying the\nGalilei invariant constraint\n\u2202a A4 = 0,\n(58)\nthen F4a \u2261 0 and tensor F\u03bc\u03bd (33) is reduced to the seven-vector \u03a8\u03037 = (K, R, A)\nwhose components are\nK = \u2207A0 \u2212 \u22020 A, R = \u2207 \u00d7 A, A = \u22020 A4 .\nTo find the corresponding invariants linear in F\u03bc\u03bd it is necessary to construct\ninvariant scalar products of vector functions (58) and matrices (38) belonging to \u03a8\u03037 .\nAs a result we come to the following equation\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n\u03b3 \u03bc \u03c0\u03bc + g\u03b7a Ra + r(Sa Ra + \u03b7a Ka + S 04 A) + \u03bd\u03b30 A \u2212 \u03bb \u03c8(x) = 0,\n\n(59)\n\nwhere g, r and \u03bd are coupling constants. For A = 0 equation (59) is reduced to\nequation (51) which describe anomalous interaction of the Galilei particle of spin 1/2\nwith external field of magnetic type.\nFormulae (51), (54), (55), (56), (57) and (59) present all non-equivalent Galilean\ninvariant equations for spinor field, describing minimal and anomalous interactions\nwith external gauge fields.\nWe see that the direct search for Galilei invariant Pauli interaction makes it possible to find more general coupling than the reduction method.\n19\n\n\f7.3\n\nGalilean system with spin-orbit coupling\n\nIn this section we consider one of the described systems and discuss its physical\ncontent.\nLet us start with equation (55) which describes interaction of the Galilean spinor\nparticle with an external electric field. Choosing \u03b3-matrices in the form (46) and\nq k\u0302\ndenoting k = \u2212 4m\nwe write this equation componentwise\n\u221a\n(\u03c3 * p \u2212 \u03bb)\u03c6 + 2 m\u03c7 = 0,\n\u221a\n2 (p0 + q\u03c6 + qmk\u0302 \u03c3 * E)\u03c6 + (\u03c3 * p + \u03bb)\u03c7 = 0\n\nwhere E = \u2212\u2207\u03c6.\nSolving the first equation for \u03c7 and substituting the result into the second equation\nwe obtain\n!\nq k\u0302\np2 + \u03bb 2\n+ q\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c3 * E \u03c6 = 0.\n(60)\nL\u03c6 \u2261 p0 \u2212\n2m\nm\nIn other word we come to the Galilei invariant Schr\u00f6dinger equation with a matrix\npotential.\nTo analyze the physical content of equation (60) we transform it to a more familiar\nki\nform using the operator U = exp(\u2212 m\n\u03c3 * p). Applying this operator to \u03c6 and L we\n\u2032 \u2032\nobtain the equation L \u03c6 = 0 where \u03c6\u2032 = U\u03c6,\nL\u2032 = ULU \u22121 = p0 \u2212\n\n\u03bb2\nq k\u0302 2\np2\n+ q\u03c6 \u2212\n\u2212\n(\u03c3 * (p \u00d7 E \u2212 E \u00d7 p) \u2212 divE) + * * *\n2m\n2m 2m2\n\nwhere the dots denote the terms of order o( m13 ).\nAll terms in operator L\u2032 have exact physical meaning. In particular, the last two\nterms describe spin-orbit and Darwin coupling of a Galilean particle with an external\nfield.\n\n8\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe relativity principle is one of the corner stones of modern physics. Moreover, it\nshould be applied while considering phenomena characterizing by circumlight velocities but also in the cases when the velocities are small in comparison with the velocity\nof light. In the latest case any well formulated physical theory should not be simple\n\"non-relativistic\", but to satisfy the Galilei relativity principle. In other words, the\ngroup of motion of the special relativity (i.e., the Lorentz group) should be replaced\nby the Galilei group.\nIt appears that a consistent use of Galilei group and its representations in many\naspects is much more complicated than in the case of Poincar\u00e9 group. In particular,\ndescription of finite- dimensional representations of the homogeneous Galilei group is\n20\n\n\fa wild algebraic problem while such representations for the Lorentz group have been\nfound long time ago.\nThe main goal of the present paper was to present the completed classification of\nindecomposable Galilean fields which transform as vectors or are scalars with respect\nto the rotation transformations. In other words, we present the classification of\nindecomposable finite dimension representations of the homogeneous Galilei group\nwhich being reduced to the rotation subgroup correspond to spins s \u2264 1. In contrast\nwith the fields with spin s > 1 the Galilean vectors field can be described completely.\nThe results of this classification are presented in Section 3.\nIn contrast with the Lorentz vectors, the number of non-equivalent Galilean vectors appears to be rather extended. Namely, for the Lorentz group there exist the\nfollowing indecomposable vector fields: four-vector, bi-vector (i.e., antisymmetric tensor of second rank) and two three-vectors which are nothing but a self-dual and anti\nself-dual parts of the antisymmetric tensor. In the case of Galilei group it is possible\nto indicate nine indecomposable vector fields.\nWe use our knowledge of vector representations of the Galilei group to describe\nall possible Pauli interactions for spinor fields, compatible with the Galilei invariance.\nThe number of such interactions appears to be rather extended in contrast with the\nrelativistic approach where this interaction is unique up to the coupling constant.\nWe show that there exist such Galilei invariant systems which describe spin-orbit and\nDarwin couplings which are traditionally treated as pure relativistic effects.\nIt is generally accepted to think that Galilei group and its representations can be\nobtained easily starting with representations of the Lorentz group and making the\nIn\u00f6n\u00fc-Wigner contraction [7]. We had shown that this procedure is not too straightforward in as much as starting with indecomposable representations of the Lorentz\ngroup we can obtain only a part of the corresponding representations of homogeneous\nGalilei group. On the other hand, it is possible to contract reducible representations\nof the Lorentz group to indecomposable representations of the homogeneous Galilei\ngroup.\nThe completed list of vector-scalar and spinor indecomposable representations representations presented in Sections 3 and 4 opens a way to describe all non-equivalent\nsystems of Galilei invariant equations for scalar, spinor and vector fields. We plane\nto discuss these equations in detail in the following paper.\n\nAckowledgements\nThis publication is based on work sponsored by the Grant Agency of the Academy\nof Sciences of the Czech Republic under project Number A1010711.
