We give a demonstration of the technique by\nwriting remote charge in a thin dielectric layer over the graphene-metal interface and detecting the\nresulting shift in local charge neutrality point. We perform electrostatic simulations to characterize\nthe gating effect of a realistic scanning probe tip on a graphene bilayer and find a good agreement\nwith the experimental results.\n\nGate tuneable conductivity underpins the operation of\na multitude of applications envisaged for graphene, ranging from switching in mass-produced field-effect transistors to single electron manipulation in quantum dots.\nTopographic, morphological, and electrostatic variability often compromises device performance, so developing\nand adapting techniques for imaging and modifying local electronic properties continues to receive considerable\ninterest. One such technique is charge writing (CW),\nwhich uses the biased tip of a scanning probe microscope\nto deposit charge in a dielectric layer electrostatically\ncoupled to a nanodevice, mainly those fabricated from\ntwo-dimensional electron gas-based systems in semiconductor heterostructures [1, 2]. Scanning gate microscopy\n(SGM) employs the same tip as a mobile gate for imaging\nthe charge-induced changes in local conductivity. While\nSGM has also recently proven capable of making charge\nneutrality point (CNP) maps of inhomogeneously doped\ngraphene flakes [3, 4], CW has yet to be used to modify\nthe local CNP. In this letter we measure and modify the\nlocal CNP using combined CW/SGM, paving the way\ntowards in situ electrostatic patterning of arbitrary potential landscapes in graphene field-effect devices.\nOur graphene devices are fabricated from flakes which\nare mechanically exfoliated from natural graphite onto a\nhighly doped Si substrate capped with a 300 nm thick\nSiO2 layer. The number of layers is identified from\ntheir optical contrast and 5/30 nm Ti/Au contacts are\npatterned using e-beam lithography, thermal evaporation, and standard PMMA lift-off processing. For improved stability and sensitivity we operate our scanning\nprobe microscope in non-contact mode (see [3] for details) and under vacuum (10\u22125 mbar) with an average\ntip-surface seperation of 5-20 nm. The SGM setup used\nto image the CNP is shown in Fig. 1(a). To benefit from the high signal-to-noise ratio achievable using\na.c. detection, we modulate the voltage VT on the tip\n(NanoWorld ARROW-NCPt) at low frequency (typically\n3 V @ 1 kHz) and detect the modulation of IDS (\u2248 250\n\u03bcA) using a lock-in amplifier. The demodulated component \u03b4IDS is proportional to the local transconductance gm = \u2202IDS /\u2202VT (\u2248 0.2 \u03bcA/V) [3, 5]. Our earlier\nwork established that the back-gate voltage which nulls\n\nFIG. 1: (a) Circuit used to perform nulling scanning gate microscopy in four-terminal configuration on a graphene bilayer\n[LIA: Lock-In Amplifier, PI: Proportional-Integral controller.]\n(b) Difference between the nulling back-gate voltage and the\nbulk neutrality point voltage as a function of d.c. voltage\napplied to the tip. (c) Map of the neutrality point V0 of\nthe bilayer. (d) Horizontal (dashed) and vertical (solid) line\nprofiles. Arrows correspond to the n-type doping features\nindicated in the map.\n\nthe transconductance is the local charge neutrality point\n(V0 ), and spatial maps of V0 were generated by performing point spectroscopy and extracting V0 at each point\n[3]. Owing to the sign change of the transconductance\neither side of V0 , gm (VBG ) is highly suited as an error signal which can be nulled in a feedback loop for real-time\ntracking of V0 , similar to the compensation of the contact potential in scanning Kelvin probe microscopy [6].\n\n\f2\n\nFIG. 2: Main figure: calculated induced electron density. Inset: schematic of tip geometry (h = 20 nm). The tip is modelled as a blunt cone with an opening angle of 30\u25e6 and a\nspherical end with R = 100 nm as shown.\n\nFig. 1(a) shows the circuit used to implement \"nulling\"\nscanning gate microscopy (NSGM). The modulation in\ncurrent \u03b4IDS is fed into a software controlled feedback\nloop which adjusts the back-gate voltage to maintain a\nconstant setpoint \u03b4IDS (V0 )=0. Fig. 1(c) shows a map\nof V0 captured using NSGM in four-terminal configuration on a bilayer flake, revealing up to 2 V variations\nin V0 . Most notably, regions with pronounced n-type\ndoping exist around the Ti/Au contacts. Line profiles\nshown in Fig. 1(d) show that the doping extends hundreds of nanometers away from the contacts. We have\nperformed NSGM on other flakes in both two and four\nterminal configurations and observe similar doping profiles around contacts, in good agreement with various\nmicroscopy studies [7\u20139] and theoretical analyses taking\ninto account the different work functions of graphene and\ntitanium [10].\nThe features in the NSGM images shown in Fig. 1(b)\nvary over hundreds of nanometers, indicating a large effect from the conical section of the tip. This is not\nunexpected as the tip used in these experiments has a\nrelatively large half-cone angle \u03b80 \u2248 30\u25e6 , which starts\nto dominate for tip-surface separations \u22655 nm [11, 12].\nA similar long-range SGM response was reported in the\ncontext of SGM on carbon nanotubes [11] and subsurface\ntwo dimensional electron gases [13, 14], where it was distinguished from finer conductance variations which occur\non the scale of the tip apex [14].\nIn addition to the length scale of the perturbation, an\nimportant parameter characterizing SGM is the carrier\ndensity induced under the tip, which can be quantified\nthrough the effective capacitive coupling \u03b2 = \u2206n/VT ,\nwhere \u2206n is the change in carrier density under the tip.\nNSGM enables us to measure \u03b2 directly by sweeping the\nDC voltage applied to the tip and tracking the nulling\nback-gate voltage. Fig. 1(b) shows a plot of the difference between the nulling voltage and the bulk neutrality\npoint voltage (VN P ) as a function of VT . Using the known\nrelationship between carrier density and back-gate voltage, n = \u03b1(VBG \u2212 VN P ) (\u03b1 = 7.2 \u00d7 1010 cm\u22122 ) [15], we\n\ninfer a coupling between the tip and the graphene of \u03b2\u2248\n13 \u00d7 109 cm\u22122 /V.\nTo obtain a theoretical estimate for the length scale\nand coupling strength of the tip perturbation, we solve\nLaplace's equation numerically in cylindrical polar coordinates for a realistic tip-sample geometry. We include the screening charge induced in the graphene selfconsistently within the Thomas-Fermi approximation. In\nour model, a blunt tip (see inset to Fig. 2) is positioned\n20 nm above a clean, homogeneous bilayer graphene sheet\nwhich lies on a 300 nm thick dielectric substrate. Experimentally we are close to the neutrality point so, in\nour idealised model, we fix the voltage at the bottom\nof the substrate to 0 V. At the upper boundary of the\ndielectric, the electric displacement is discontinuous by\nan amount determined by the charge density induced\nin the bilayer. We calculate this self-consistently. The\nFermi level, EF (r), in the bilayer varies spatially with\nthe voltage in the graphene and the induced charge density, ni (r) = \u03b31 (EF (r) \u2212 Eg (r))/(2\u03c0P 2 ) for EF > Eg /2,\nis derived from the low energy parabolic dispersion for a\nbilayer [16]. Here, P = 0.539 eV nm [17], \u03b31 = 0.39 eV\n[16] and Eg (r) = [e2 Vbl2 \u03b312 /(e2 Vbl2 +\u03b312 )]1/2 [18] is the band\ngap induced in the bilayer due to the bias, Vbl , across it.\nThe calculated charge density is shown in Fig. 2. In\nour calculation we extend the system in radial (to r = 50\n\u03bcm) and vertical (to z = 6.3 \u03bcm) directions until ni (r) is\nconverged to within 0.05% for r < 5 \u03bcm. Qualitatively,\nni (r) is not sensitive to the band-structure model. Even\nchanging the bilayer to monolayer graphene has an effect\nof less than a few percent. Instead, it is the tip shape and\nVT that primarily determine ni (r). Within r < 5 \u03bcm we\nfind that the charge density is well fitted by the sum\nof two Lorentzians. The Lorentzian peak height varies\nlinearly with VT , but the half widths are insensitive to\ntip voltage and vary by < 1% for 0.5 \u2264 VT \u2264 3 V. At\nVT = 3 V the wider of the Lorentzians has a peak height,\nni (0) = 14 \u00d7 109 cm\u22122 , and a half width of 3.6 \u03bcm. This\nfits well with the observed micron-sized perturbation and\ngives a value for \u03b2 = \u2206n/VT = ni (0)/VT \u2248 5 \u00d7 109\ncm\u22122 /V, similar to that found experimentally.\nWe now show how the tip can be employed to modify the CNP map by performing CW to induce holes in\nthe graphene and thereby partially compensate for the ntype doping around the contacts. We spin coated a 100\nnm thick layer of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) to\nact as the CW dielectric over the device shown in Fig.\n3(a). Fig. 3(b) shows the NSGM map in the presence\nof the PMMA layer. Note the reduced spatial resolution due to the necessity of scanning \u2248 100 nm from\nthe surface, and the enhanced n-type doping, especially\nnext to the contacts where V0 reaches as low as \u2248 -9 V.\nFurther work is required to use thinner and less invasive\ndielectrics. Prior to CW we acquire a high resolution\nNSGM image of V0 (x, y) next to the contacts [Fig. 3(c),\nimage 1]. To perform CW in PMMA we follow the procedure presented in [19] for creating electrostatic templates.\nThe tip is brought in to hard tapping-mode contact over\n\n\f3\nthe doped region and a square-wave signal between -10\nand -30 V at 50 Hz is applied to the tip. These values\nbring the pulses over the \u2248 15 V threshold pulse amplitude for charge deposition in PMMA [19]. As expected in\ntapping mode and pulsed writing, topographic imaging\ndid not show any subsequent damage to the PMMA [19].\nFor imaging the deposited charge we employ electrostatic\nforce microscopy (EFM), and Kelvin probe microscopy\nwhen quantitative estimates of the surface potential are\nrequired. An EFM image showing the shift in frequency\n(\u2206f ) of the cantilever over the charged region is shown\nin Fig. 3(c), image 2. The charge is well localized and\ncorresponds to a surface potential of \u2248 -2 V. We re-map\nV0 in NSGM after CW (Fig. 3(c), image 3) and construct\nthe difference (Fig. 3(c), image 4) to enhance the CNP\nshift. Line profiles in Fig. 3(d) show a good correspondence between the peaks of written charge and the CNP\nshift, which is \u2248 800 mV. We found the charge to be stable for several days under vacuum at room temperature,\nin good agreement with previous observations [19].\n\nFIG. 3: (a) Setup used to write charge in a 100 nm thick layer\nof PMMA spin-coated over the graphene. Voltage pulses (20\nVP k\u2212P k @ 50 Hz) are applied to the tip in tapping mode\nto write charge. (b) Nulling scanning gate micrograph showing the charge neutrality point distribution prior to writing.\n(c) Procedure for combining NSGM with charge writing to\nsequentially read and write charge neutrality point distributions over graphene devices. (d) Line profiles of the neutrality\npoint and frequency shift for the NSGM and EFM images, respectively.\n\nIn conclusion, we have introduced a method combining charge writing and scanning gate microscopy to read\nand write the local charge neutrality point on a graphene\ndevice. We mapped the variation of doping across a bilayer flake and found micron-sized n-type doping from\nTi/Au contacts. We performed electrostatic simulations\nto analyze the interaction between the biased tip and the\ngraphene and deduced a capacitive coupling of \u03b2\u2248 5\u00d7109\ncm\u22122 /V which is in reasonable quantitative agreement\nwith the value determined experimentally. We deposited\ncharge with a surface potential of \u2248 2 V and shifted\nthe CNP of a region next to the metallic contacts by \u2248\n800 mV. The use of thinner, less invasive dielectrics with\nhigher permittivity would enable the in situ fabrication\nof graphene devices with arbitrary potential landscapes,\nand band-gaps in the case of graphene bilayers [20].\nThis work was financially supported by the European\nGRAND project (ICT/FET) and EPSRC.\n\n[1] R.
