[4, 5]. There have, of course, been many suggestions\nfor alternative mechanisms; see, e.g., Refs. [6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11] and references therein. One\npossibility motivated by condensed-matter physics would be Fermi-point splitting of the\nStandard Model fermions due to a new type of quantum phase transition [12, 13].\nThe phenomenology of a \"radical\" neutrino-oscillation model with strictly zero mass\ndifferences and nonzero Fermi-point splittings has been discussed in Refs. [14, 15]. A less\nextreme possibility would be a type of \"stealth scenario\" with Fermi-point-splitting effects\nhiding behind mass-difference effects [15]. The present article aims to give an exploratory\ndiscussion of this last possibility.\nSpecifically, we consider the case with both mass-square differences \u2206m2 and timelike Fermi-point splittings \u2206b0 . (Timelike Fermi-point splittings preserve spatial isotropy,\nwhereas spacelike splittings give anisotropic neutrino oscillations [14].) There are then two\nmethods to determine the presence of these \u2206b0 terms. The first method is to use sufficiently\nhigh neutrino energies E\u03bd so that the mass-difference effects drop out, |\u2206m2 /(2E\u03bd )| \u226a |\u2206b0 |\nfor generic mixing angles. The second method is to look at a particular process which is\nexpected to be small for standard mass-difference neutrino oscillations.\nAn example of the second method is provided by the standard appearance probability\nP (\u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bde ) \u221d sin2 (2\u03b813 ), for small values of the mixing angle \u03b813 and not too large travel\ndistance L. If there are relatively weak Fermi-point splittings in addition to the mass\ndifferences, one has a similar expression for P (\u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bde ) but with the \"bare\" mixing angle\n\u03b813 replaced by an effective mixing angle \u039813 , which is now a function of the basic parameters.\nPhenomenologically, the most interesting consequence would be that \u039813 becomes energy\ndependent. The resulting \u03bde energy spectrum near the first oscillation maximum will be\ndiscussed in detail for a simple three-flavor model. Let us remark that, quite generally,\nthe goal of the present article is to point out a possible energy dependence of all neutrinooscillation parameters and the simple three-flavor model is used as an explicit example.\nThe outline of this article is as follows. Section II gives the basic mechanism for the\ncase of two neutrino flavors. Section III incorporates these results in a simple three-flavor\nmodel with a single dimensionless parameter to describe the relative strength of Fermi-pointsplitting and mass-difference effects. Section IV addresses certain phenomenological issues\nand gives possible signatures for planned or proposed superbeam experiments (e.g., T2K or\nNO\u03bdA). In addition, further model results are given which may be relevant to the current\nMINOS experiment. Section V contains concluding remarks.\n\n2\n\n\fII.\n\nTWO-FLAVOR MODEL\n\nThe starting point of our discussion is the following generalized neutrino dispersion relation [13]:\np\nE\u03bd (~p ) = (c\u03bd p + b0\u03bd )2 + m2\u03bd c4\u03bd \u223c c\u03bd p + b0\u03bd + m2\u03bd c3\u03bd /(2 p) ,\n(2.1)\nfor large enough neutrino momentum p \u2261 |~p | and with a maximum neutrino velocity c\u03bd ,\na timelike Fermi-point-splitting parameter b0\u03bd , and a mass parameter m\u03bd . Now, consider\ntwo-flavor vacuum neutrino oscillations from both mass differences and timelike Fermi-point\nsplittings [14, 15]. The relevant energy differences are then obtained from the eigenvalues of\nthe 2 \u00d7 2 Hermitian matrix [8]\nc\u03bd p A + B0 + M 2 c3\u03bd /(2 p) ,\n\n(2.2)\n\nwith p \u2261 |~p | and 2 \u00d7 2 Hermitian matrices A, B0 , and M 2 . In our case, we have A equal to\nthe identity matrix, A = 11, and the maximum neutrino velocity c\u03bd equal to the velocity of\nlight in vacuo, c\u03bd = c. Natural units with ~ = c = 1 will be used in the following.\nFor two neutrino flavors (denoted f and g) and large enough beam energy E\u03bd , the survival\nand appearance probabilities over a travel distance L are given by\nP (\u03bdf \u2192 \u03bdf ) = 1 \u2212 P (\u03bdf \u2192 \u03bdg ) ,\n\n(2.3a)\n\nP (\u03bdf \u2192 \u03bdg ) \u223c sin2 (2 \u0398) sin2 (\u2206E L/2) ,\n\n(2.3b)\n\nwith \u2206E \u2265 0 and \u0398 \u2208 [ 0, \u03c0/2 ] defined by [8]\n\u2206E sin 2 \u0398 = | \u2206m2 /(2E\u03bd ) sin 2\u03b8 + exp(\u0131 2 \u03b3) \u2206b sin 2\u03c7 | ,\n\n(2.4a)\n\n\u2206E cos 2 \u0398 = \u2206m2 /(2E\u03bd ) cos 2\u03b8 + \u2206b cos 2\u03c7 .\n\n(2.4b)\n\nHere, \u2206m2 \u2261 m22 \u2212 m21 is the difference of the eigenvalues of the matrix M 2 and \u03b8 is the\n(2)\n(1)\nrelated mixing angle. In the same way, \u2206b \u2261 b0 \u2212 b0 and \u03c7 come from the matrix B0 . In\naddition, there is one relative phase, \u03b3.\nEquations (2.4ab) make clear that, provided \u2206m2 and \u2206b are nonzero, the effective\nmixing angle \u0398 interpolates between a value close to \u03c7 for relatively high beam energy E\u03bd\nand a value close to \u03b8 for relatively low beam energy E\u03bd [but still large enough for Eq. (2.2)\nto apply, see also Sec. IV A]. In order to be more explicit, we restrict ourselves to the two\n\"extreme\" values for the mixing angles \u03b8 and \u03c7, namely, the values 0 and \u03c0/4. We, again,\nassume that both \u2206m2 and \u2206b are nonzero. Three of the four possible cases then lead to\nneutrino oscillations:\ncase 1 :\ncase 2 :\ncase 3 :\n\n\u03b8=0\n\u03b8 = \u03c0/4\n\u03b8 = \u03c0/4\n\nand\nand\nand\n\n\u03c7 = \u03c0/4 ,\n\u03c7 = \u03c0/4 ,\n\u03c7 = 0.\n3\n\n(2.5)\n\n\fSince the results for case 3 follow simply from those for case 1, we only need to give the\nresults for cases 1 and 2 (denoted by a single and a double prime, respectively).\nCase 1 has appearance probability\nP \u2032 (\u03bdf \u2192 \u03bdg ) \u223c sin2 (2 \u0398\u2032) sin2 ( \u2206E \u2032 L/2 ) ,\n\u2206E \u2032 =\n\u2032\n\np\n(\u2206b)2 + (\u2206m2 /(2E\u03bd ))2 ,\n\n2 \u0398 = arctan\n\n\u0012\n\n|\u2206b|\n\u2206m2 /(2E\u03bd )\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\n(2.6a)\n(2.6b)\n(2.6c)\n\nwith the dependence on phase \u03b3 dropping out altogether. Observe that the effective mixing\nangle \u0398\u2032 is energy dependent, rising from a value 0 at E\u03bd \u223c 0 to a value \u03c0/4 for E\u03bd \u2192 \u221e.\nCase 2 has survival probability\n\u0001\nP \u2032\u2032 (\u03bdf \u2192 \u03bdf ) \u223c 1 \u2212 sin2 exp(\u0131 2 \u03b3) \u2206b + \u2206m2 /(2E\u03bd ) L/2 ,\n(2.7)\n\nwith a constant mixing angle \u0398\u2032\u2032 = \u03c0/4. Observe that the probabilities are \u03b3 dependent. In\nfact, neutrino oscillations at energies E\u03bd = |\u2206m2 /(2\u2206b)| are entirely suppressed for \u03b3 = \u03c0/2\nor 0, depending on the relative sign of \u2206b and \u2206m2 .\nCase 3 has a survival probability P \u2032\u2032\u2032 and effective mixing angle \u0398\u2032\u2032\u2032 given by (2.6abc)\nwith \u2206b and \u2206m2 /(2E\u03bd ) interchanged. This implies that \u0398\u2032\u2032\u2032 has a value \u03c0/4 at E\u03bd \u223c 0 and\nvanishes for E\u03bd \u2192 \u221e.\nWith the heuristics of the two-flavor case established, we turn to the more complicated\nthree-flavor case in the next section.\nIII.\n\nTHREE-FLAVOR MODEL\n\nFor three neutrino flavors, the diagonalization of the energy matrix (2.2), now in terms\nof 3 \u00d7 3 Hermitian matrices A = 11, B0 , and M 2 , gives many more mixing angles and\nphases than for the two-flavor case. Using Iwasawa decompositions of the relevant SU(3)\nmatrices, one has the following parameters: {\u03b821 , \u03b832 , \u03b813 , \u03b4} for an SU(3) matrix X from\nM 2 , {\u03c721 , \u03c732 , \u03c713 , \u01eb} for an SU(3) matrix Y from B0 , and {\u03b1, \u03b2} for a diagonal phase-factor\nmatrix P generated by the Cartan subalgebra.\nSpecifically, the matrices P and N = X, Y are defined as follows:\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\ne\u0131\u03b2\n0\n0\n\u0001 \uf8ec\n\uf8f7\nP \u2261 diag e\u0131\u03b2 , e\u2212\u0131(\u03b1+\u03b2) , e\u0131\u03b1 \u2261 \uf8ed 0 e\u2212\u0131(\u03b1+\u03b2) 0 \uf8f8 ,\n(3.1a)\n0\n0\ne\u0131\u03b1\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6 \uf8eb\n\uf8f6 \uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n1 0\n0\nc13\n0 +s13 e+i\u03c9\nc21 s21 0\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7 \uf8ec\n\uf8f7 \uf8ec\n\uf8f7\nN \u2261 \uf8ed 0 c32 s32 \uf8f8 * \uf8ed\n0\n1\n0\n\uf8f8 * \uf8ed \u2212s21 c21 0 \uf8f8 ,\n0 \u2212s32 c32\n\u2212s13 e\u2212i\u03c9 0\nc13\n0\n0 1\n4\n\n(3.1b)\n\n\fwith {sij , cij , \u03c9} equal to {sin \u03b8ij , cos \u03b8ij , \u03b4} for the matrix N = X and to {sin \u03c7ij , cos \u03c7ij , \u01eb}\nfor the matrix N = Y . The relevant terms of the Hamiltonian in the flavor basis are then\nDp + X Dm X \u22121 + P Y Db0 Y \u22121 P \u22121 ,\n\n(3.2)\n\nwith diagonal matrices\nDp \u2261 diag ( p , p , p ) ,\n\nDm \u2261 diag\n\n\u0012\n\nm21 m22 m23\n,\n,\n2p 2p 2p\n\n\u0013\n\n,\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\nDb0 \u2261 diag b0 , b0 , b0\n,\n\n(3.3)\n\nfor p \u2261 |~p | and c\u03bd = c = 1. For later use, we already define the differences \u2206m2ij \u2261 m2i \u2212 m2j\n(ij)\n(i)\n(j)\nand \u2206b0 \u2261 b0 \u2212 b0 .\nThe structure of the vacuum neutrino-oscillation probabilities is the same as for the\nstandard case (Db0 = 0); see, e.g., Eqs. (7)\u2013(10) of Ref. [4]. These probabilities are given\nin terms of six parameters \u2206E21 , \u2206E31 , \u039821 , \u039832 , \u039813 , and \u2206, which are now complicated\n(21)\n(31)\nfunctions of the fourteen original parameters \u2206m221 /(2p), \u2206m231 /(2p), \u2206b0 , \u2206b0 , \u03b821 , \u03b832 ,\n\u03b813 , \u03b4, \u03c721 , \u03c732 , \u03c713 , \u01eb, \u03b1, and \u03b2.\nIn order to illustrate the basic idea and to use the two-flavor results of the previous section,\nwe consider a specific model with the following mass-term differences and bi-maximal mixing\nangles:\n\u2206m221 /(2p) = 0 ,\n\u03b813 = 0 ,\n\n\u2206m231 /(2p) \u2261 \u2206\u03bc > 0 ,\n\n(3.4a)\n\n\u03b821 = \u03b832 = \u03c0/4 ,\n\n(3.4b)\n\na similar pattern of timelike Fermi-point splittings and trimaximal mixing angles:\n(21)\n\n\u2206b0\n\n= 0,\n\n(31)\n\n\u2206b0\n\n\u2261 \u2206b0 > 0 ,\n\n(3.5a)\n\n\u03c713 = \u03c721 = \u03c732 = \u03c0/4 ,\n\n(3.5b)\n\nand vanishing phases:\n\u03b4 = \u01eb = \u03b1 = \u03b2 = 0.\n\n(3.6)\n\nThe values (3.4ab) are more or less standard with |\u2206m231 | \u2248 2.5 \u00d7 10\u22123 eV2 ; cf. Refs. [4, 5].\n(21)\nThe actual values of \u03b821 and \u03c721 are, in fact, irrelevant for the case \u2206m221 = \u2206b0 = 0. As\nit stands, the simple model depends on only one positive dimensionless parameter, \u2206b0 /\u2206\u03bc.\nExplicit expressions for the energy eigenvalues En of the corresponding matrix (3.2) are\nreadily obtained and give the following differences:\n\u0012\n\u0013\nq\n1\n2\n(3.7a)\n\u2206E21 \u2261 E2 \u2212 E1 = 2 \u2206\u03bc + \u2206b0 \u2212 \u2206\u03bc2 + \u2206b0 ,\n\u2206E31 \u2261 E3 \u2212 E1 =\n\n1\n2\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\nq\n2\n\u2206\u03bc + \u2206b0 + \u2206\u03bc2 + \u2206b0 .\n5\n\n(3.7b)\n\n\f< 10% for \u2206b0 < 0.2 \u2206\u03bc. In the\nThe most important result for us is that |\u2206E21 /\u2206E31 | \u223c\n\u223c\nfollowing discussion, we assume 0 < \u2206b0 \u226a \u2206\u03bc, which allows us to use simplified expressions\nfor the oscillation probabilities; cf. Refs. [4, 5]. (Note that the approximation \u2206b0 \u226b \u2206\u03bc > 0\nwould be equally simple.)\nIn the context of three-flavor neutrino oscillations, case 1 of Eq. (2.5) with \u03b8 = 0 may be\nrelevant to the \u03b813 mixing angle, which is known to be rather small from the CHOOZ [16]\nand Palo Verde [17] experiments. For three-flavor parameters (3.4)\u2013(3.6), large enough beam\n< 1), the \u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bde appearance\nenergy E\u03bd , and not too large travel distance (L\u2206b0 \u226a L\u2206\u03bc \u223c\nprobability is essentially given by Eq. (2.6) and reads\n\u0001\nP\u03bce \u2261 P (\u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bde ) \u223c 12 sin2 (2 \u039813 ) sin2 ( \u2206E31 L/2 ) + O (\u2206b0 L)2 ,\n(3.8a)\n2 \u039813 \u223c arctan\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2206b0\n\u2206\u03bc\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0001\n+ O (\u2206b0 /\u2206\u03bc)2 ,\n\n(3.8b)\n\nwith \u2206E31 given by expression (3.7b). Analytically, the omitted terms in Eq. (3.8a) would\nbe negligible if the \"bare\" mixing angle \u03b813 were small but finite. But, for the simple model\nconsidered with \u03b813 = 0 exactly, the omitted terms could, in principle, be important and\nonly a comparison with the full numerical result can be conclusive (see Sec. IV B).\nCase 2 of Eq. (2.5) with \u03b8 = \u03c0/4, on the other hand, may be relevant to the \u03b832 mixing\nangle, which is known to be nearly maximal from the SK results [18, 19]. For three-flavor\nparameters (3.4)\u2013(3.6), large enough beam energy E\u03bd , and not too large travel distance L,\nthe \u03bc\u2013type survival probability is essentially given by Eq. (2.7) and reads\n\u0001\nP\u03bc\u03bc \u2261 P (\u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bd\u03bc ) \u223c 1 \u2212 sin2 ( \u2206E31 L/2 ) + O \u2206b0 \u2206\u03bc L2 ,\n(3.9)\n\nagain with \u2206E31 given by expression (3.7b). Typically, one expects O (\u2206b0 /\u2206\u03bc) corrections\nto the probabilities. There could also be interesting effects for an extended version of the\nmodel with nonzero phases \u03b1 and \u03b2, as mentioned a few lines below Eq. (2.7). But, these\nissues will not be pursued further here.\nIV.\nA.\n\nPHENOMENOLOGY\nPreliminaries\n\nIn order to connect with future experiments which aim to determine or constrain the\nstandard energy-independent mixing angle \u03b813 , consider the appearance probability (3.8)\nfrom the simple model (3.1)\u2013(3.6). For relatively weak Fermi-point splitting, 0 < \u2206b0 \u2261\n(31)\n\u2206b0 \u226a \u2206\u03bc \u2261 \u2206m231 /(2p), the effective mixing angle \u039813 then has a linear dependence on\nthe neutrino beam energy E\u03bd \u223c p \u2261 |~p | and is given by\n\u039813 \u223c\n\nE\u03bd\n(31)\n2\u0001\n\u2206b\n+\nO\n(\u2206b\n/\u2206\u03bc)\n,\n0\n0\n\u2206m231\n6\n\n(4.1)\n\n\fsince the argument of the arctangent function in Eq. (3.8b) is positive. If experiment can now\nestablish an upper bound \u2206\u039813 on the variation of \u039813 (E) over an energy range \u2206E\u03bd range ,\none obtains an upper bound on \u2206b0 . From Eq. (4.1), one has\n(31) <\n|\u2206b0 | \u223c\n|\u2206m231 \u2206\u039813 /\u2206E\u03bd range |\n\n\u2248 6 \u00d7 10\n\n\u221213\n\neV\n\n\u0012\n\n|\u2206m231 |\n2.5 \u00d7 10\u22123 eV2\n\n\u0013\u0012\n\nsin2 (2\u2206\u039813 )\n0.05\n\n\u00131/2 \u0012\n\n0.5 GeV\n|\u2206E\u03bd range |\n\n\u0013\n\n, (4.2)\n\nwith more or less realistic values inserted for the planned T2K experiment [20] (for the\nproposed NO\u03bdA experiment [21], the energy range could be four times larger, giving a four\ntimes smaller upper bound for the Fermi-point splitting).\nA next-generation superbeam [22, 23] or neutrino factory [24, 25] could perhaps reach\na 102 times better sensitivity than shown in Eq. (4.2), assuming sin2 (2\u2206\u039813 ) \u2248 0.002 and\n\u2206E\u03bd range \u2248 10 GeV. New reactor experiments [26], however, would operate at lower energies and would have less sensitivity by a factor of 102 , assuming sin2 (2\u2206\u039813 ) \u2248 0.05 and\n\u2206E\u03bd range \u2248 5 MeV. As mentioned before, the neutrino energy E\u03bd must still be large enough\nfor Eqs. (2.1),(2.2), and (3.2) to apply, which we take to mean E\u03bd \u226b 1 keV, based on the\n(e)\nabsolute bound |b0 | \u2264 1 keV reported in Ref. [27], the conservative differential bounds\nP\n(ij)\n2\n|\u2206b0 | \u2264 10\u221211 eV from Refs. [14, 15], and the absolute bound\ni mi \u2264 10 eV from\ncosmology [4, 5].\nSince there could be Fermi-point-splitting effects hiding in the existing neutrino oscillation data with |\u2206b0 | of the order of 10\u221212 eV [14, 15], superbeam experiments [20, 21, 22, 23]\nlook the most promising in the near future, as neutrino factories may very well remain in\nthe R&D phase for at least 10 years. In Sec. IV B, we, therefore, expand on the appearance\nprobability P (\u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bde ) at forthcoming off-axis superbeam experiments which can be expected to have relatively good control of the backgrounds. In Sec. IV C, we also discuss this\nappearance probability for the on-axis MINOS experiment which can have relatively high\nneutrino energies.\nB.\n\nModel results near the first oscillation maximum\n\nIn this subsection, we consider the appearance probability P\u03bce \u2261 P (\u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bde ) from the\nsimple model (3.1)\u2013(3.6) with both mass-square differences and timelike Fermi-point splittings. Experimentally, there are two important parameters to determine from the measured\n(31)\n(31)\nvalues of the quantity P\u03bce = P\u03bce (L, E\u03bd ), namely \u2206m231 and \u2206b0 , where |\u2206b0 | is assumed\nto be less than |\u2206m231 |/(2E\u03bd ) for typical energies E\u03bd . Perhaps the simplest way to determine\n(31)\nor constrain |\u2206b0 | would be to place the far detector close to the first oscillation maximum\ncorresponding to the average energy E \u03bd . The near detector close to the source determines\nthe initial \u03bd\u03bc flux. The idea is then to measure the \u03bde energy spectrum in the far detector\nand to compare with the standard predictions.\n7\n\n\fThe shape of P\u03bce vs. E\u03bd for our combined mass-difference and Fermi-point-splitting\n(MD+FPS) model is, indeed, different from the one of the standard mass-difference (MD)\nmodel.

The approximate model probabilities from Eq. (4.4) [thin\nbroken curves in Fig. 1] are quite reliable for x \u2248 1 but overshoot by some 40 % for larger\nvalues of x, as follows by comparison to the full numerical results [thin solid curves in\nFig. 1] which monotonically approach a constant value as x \u2192 \u221e. Note, however, that\nthis asymptotic value P = 21 sin2 (\u03c0 \u039813 ) = 12 sin2 (\u2206b0 L/2) is correctly reproduced by the\napproximation (4.4a) for l = 1 and 1/x = 0. The analytic expression (4.4a) can, therefore,\nbe used to get rough estimates. (For corresponding probabilities in another model, see Fig. 8\nin Ref. [15].)\nThe \u03bde energy spectrum at L = L depends on the initial \u03bd\u03bc spectrum at L = 0, assuming\nnegligible contamination by \u03bde 's. (Note that, for a real experiment, backgrounds are better\ncontrolled in the off-axis configuration than in the on-axis configuration [20, 21].) As an\nexample, we take for this initial \u03bd\u03bc spectrum the following function [cf. upper heavy solid\ncurve in Fig. 2 ]:\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 sin2 (x \u03c0/2) ,\nfor x \u2208 [0, 1) ,\nf\u03bc (x)| L=0 =\n(4.6)\n\uf8f3\n2\nexp [\u2212(x \u2212 1) ] , for x \u2208 [1, \u221e) ,\n8\n\n\fP\n0.070\n0.060\n0.050\n0.040\n0.030\n0.020\n0.010\n0\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\n3.5\n\n4.0\n\nx\n\nFIG. 1: Fixed-distance probabilities P (\u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bde ) at l \u2261 L/L = 1 vs. dimensionless energy x \u2261\nE\u03bd /E \u03bd for the simple model (3.1)\u2013(3.6) with both mass differences and Fermi-point splittings [thin\n\nbroken and solid curves] and for the standard mass-difference model without Fermi-point splittings\n[heavy solid curve with maxima P = 0.025 at x \u2264 1, the plot being suppressed for x \u2264 0.175 ].\n\nThe thin broken curves and the heavy solid curve are given by the analytic expressions (4.4) and\n(4.5), respectively, with parameters sin2 (2\u039813 ) = 0.01, 0.02, 0.04, and sin2 (2\u03b813 ) = 0.05.

(4.4a).\nThe reader is invited to compare the solid curves of Fig. 2 with Figs. 6b and 13a of\nRef. [20] for T2K, which give the initial \u03bd\u03bc spectrum and the expected \u03bde signal for massdifference oscillations with sin2 (2\u03b813 ) = 0.1 (i.e., twice the value used in our figures). T2K\nwould appear to be able to measure the oscillation probability (4.4) for sin2 (2\u039813 ) = 0.04,\n(31)\nwhich corresponds to |\u2206b0 | \u2248 4 \u00d7 10\u221213 eV, according to Eq. (4.3b) for E \u03bd = 0.6 GeV\nand \u2206m231 = 2.5 \u00d7 10\u22123 eV2 . The proposed NO\u03bdA experiment [21] would be sensitive to\n(31)\napproximately four times smaller values of the Fermi-point splitting, |\u2206b0 | \u2248 10\u221213 eV,\nbecause of the approximately four times higher energy, even though L \u2248 810 km is a bit\nshort of L \u2248 1200 km.

Possible signatures of the simple model (3.1)\u2013(3.6) for the \u03bde energy spectrum at\nL = L would be a shift of the initial x = 1 peak to x \u2248 1.4, practically zero activity for\n< 0.5, and an enhanced signal for x > 2.\nx\u223c\n\u223c\nExpanding on this last point, it is clear that an initial energy spectrum with a pronounced\nhigh-energy tail would be advantageous. As an example, we take the following function [cf.\nupper heavy solid curve in Fig. 3 ]:\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 sin2 (x \u03c0/2) ,\nfor x \u2208 [0, 1) ,\nfe\u03bc (x)\n=\n(4.8)\n\uf8f3\nL=0\n2\n1/ [1 + (x \u2212 1) ] , for x \u2208 [1, \u221e) ,\n10\n\n\f\u221a\nwhich has an area larger than the one from Eq. (4.6) by a factor (1 + \u03c0)/(1 + \u03c0) \u2248 1.5.\nFigure 3 shows the resulting \u03bde energy spectra from Eq. (4.7) with f\u03bc (x) replaced by fe\u03bc (x).\nIn this case, the new-physics signal at x \u2248 2 would be quite strong, being approximately\nthree times larger for the combined mass-difference and Fermi-point-splitting model with\n\u03b813 = 0 and sin2 (2\u039813 ) = 0.04 [upper thin solid curve of Fig. 3 ] than for the standard\nmass-difference model with sin2 (2\u03b813 ) = 0.05 [lower heavy solid curve of Fig. 3 ].\nIn order to distinguish Fermi-point-splitting effects from mass-difference effects, it is\nclearly preferable to use a (pure) \u03bc\u2013type neutrino beam with a broad energy spectrum and\nhigh average energy. For this reason, we take a closer look at the potential of the current\nMINOS experiment in the next subsection.\nC.\n\nModel results short of the first oscillation maximum\n\nIn this subsection, we give model results which may be relevant to the on-axis MINOS\nexperiment [28, 29] with baseline L = 735 km. In order to be specific, we focus on the\nmedium energy (ME) mode of MINOS with an average beam energy of approximately E \u03bd =\n7.5 GeV, but the results are qualitatively the same for the low-energy (LE) and high-energy\n(HE) modes with E \u03bd approximately equal to 3.75 GeV and 15 GeV, respectively. The\naverage energy E \u03bd = 7.5 GeV corresponds to a length scale L \u2248 3720 km, according to\nEq. (4.3a) for \u2206m231 = 2.5 \u00d7 10\u22123 eV2 .\nThe approximate probability for the simple model (3.1)\u2013(3.6) is again given by Eq. (4.4).\nFigure 4 shows the approximate probabilities and the full numerical results as thin broken\nand thin solid curves, respectively, for model parameters l \u2261 L/L = 735/3720 and \u039813 =\n(0.3, 0.6, 0.9), which correspond to \u2206b0 \u2248 (1, 2, 3) \u00d7 10\u221213 eV, according to Eq. (4.3b) for\nE \u03bd = 7.5 GeV and \u2206m231 = 2.5 \u00d710\u22123 eV2 . The results for the LE and HE modes of MINOS\n> 1, because the asymptotic value P = 1 sin2 (\u2206b0 L/2) is independent of\nare similar for x \u223c\n2\nthe beam energy (for corresponding probabilities in another model, see Fig. 7 in Ref. [15]).\nNote that the standard mass-difference probability (4.5) at x = 1 is less than 1 % for\nl = 735/3720 and sin2 (2\u03b813 ) = 0.2, which is just above the 90 % CL limit (analysis A at\n\u2206m2 = 2.5 \u00d7 10\u22123 eV2 ) from CHOOZ [16]. This standard probability is shown as the heavy\nsolid curve in Fig. 4.\nFigure 5 gives the resulting \u03bde energy spectra for an initial \u03bc\u2013type spectrum (4.8). Again,\nthe results are qualitatively the same for the LE and HE energy-modes of MINOS, but the\nexpected event rates for the HE mode would be larger than for the ME mode and the\nspectrum would also be somewhat broader.\nTo summarize, if MINOS in the ME mode is able to place an upper limit on the appearance probability P (\u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bde ) of the order of 5 %, this would correspond to an upper\n(31)\nlimit on |\u2206b0 sin 2\u03c713 | of the order of 2 \u00d7 10\u221213 eV (and a factor two better in the HE\n> 1 would indicate nonstandard\nmode).

The \u03bde spectra are\n\nshown as the thin solid curves [approximate values as thin broken curves] for the simple model\nwith both mass differences (\u03b813 = 0) and Fermi-point splittings (see Fig. 4 for further details). The\nlower heavy solid curve gives, for comparison, the \u03bde spectrum from the standard mass-difference\nmechanism with sin2 (2\u03b813 ) = 0.2 and l = 735/3720.\n\n(Fermi-point-splitting?) physics, since, as mentioned above, the standard mass-difference\nprobability can be expected to be at most 1 %.\n\n12\n\n\fV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn this article, we have considered a simple neutrino-oscillation model (3.1)\u2013(3.6) with\nboth nonzero mass-square differences (m21 = m22 6= m23 ) and timelike Fermi-point splittings\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n(b0 = b0 6= b0 ), together with a combined bi-maximal and trimaximal mixing pattern. We\nexpect our basic conclusions to carry over to a more general model with, for example, nonzero\n(n)\nphases \u03b4, \u01eb, \u03b1, \u03b2, and all values of m2n and b0 different. As mentioned in the Introduction,\nthe main goal of the present article has been to point out a possible energy dependence of\nall neutrino-oscillation parameters (for three flavors: three mixing angles \u0398ij and one phase\n\u2206, in addition to the two eigenvalue differences \u2206Eij ).\nTaking the \u03b813 angle of the mass-square matrix in the simple model to be 0 (or very small)\nand the \u03c713 angle of the Fermi-point-splitting matrix to be \u03c0/4 (or very close to maximal), we\nhave calculated the energy-dependent effective mixing angle \u039813 for the \u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bde appearance\nprobability. This probability P (\u03bd\u03bc \u2192 \u03bde ) is approximately given by Eq. (3.8) and, near the\nfirst oscillation maximum, by Eq. (4.4) for l \u2261 L/L = 1 and Fig. 1. The resulting \u03bde energy\nspectra are shown in Figs. 2 and 3 for different initial \u03bd\u03bc energy spectra. Similar results at\na smaller value of the dimensionless distance l have been presented in Figs. 4 and 5.\nThese results show that, even for a (simple) model with Fermi-point splittings hiding\n(31)\nbehind mass differences, a value \u03b813 \u2248 0 would allow for a detection of |\u2206b0 sin 2\u03c713 | at\nthe level of 10\u221213 eV in a NO\u03bdA\u2013type experiment. But, it is also possible that MINOS\ncan already place tight upper bounds on (or make the discovery of) Fermi-point splitting,\nprovided the backgrounds are under control.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nPart of this work was done at the Center for Theoretical Physics of the Massachusetts\nInstitute of Technology and discussions with members and visitors are gratefully acknowledged.
