Along with the Supernova explosions and Gamma Ray\nbursts, they are regarded as the most probable sources of ultra high-energy\ncosmic rays within the galaxy. From the point of view of available energy, pulsars\nare even a more promising source because the rotational energy at birth can be\nmore than ten times of the energy released in a typical supernova explosion. It\nalso has the necessary conditions for accelerating particles to ultra high energies.\nMoreover observation of pulsed and/or steady flux of electromagnetic radiations\nfrom radio to gamma ray energies provides direct evidence that some pulsars are\nsite of energetic particles of at least several TeV. Another important feature is\nthe maximum energy (Emax ) attainable by a particle in the acceleration process.\nIn the case of SNR this is at most 1015 eV [13]. On the other hand according\nto the Hillas condition [14], the maximum energy of a particle of charge Ze that\ncan be contained near the light cylinder of a pulsar of angular speed \u03a9 rad s\u22121 ,\n\u2217 Email\n\naddress: aru bhadra@yahoo.com\n\n1\n\n\fradius R and with the surface magnetic field Bs = B12 \u00d7 1012 Gauss is\n17\n\nEmax = 3.4 \u00d7 10 ZB12\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03a9\n103 s\u22121\n\n\u00132 \u0012\n\nR\n106 cm\n\n\u00133\n\neV\n\n(1)\n\nwhich shows that the maximum possible energy can be very large, for fast\nrotating pulsars Emax even could reach around 100 EeV [1,7], the highest energy\ncosmic ray particles observed so far. A point that usually has been raised\nagainst the pulsar model of origin of cosmic rays is that the derived spectrum of\ncosmic rays from pulsars is much flatter than the observed spectrum. However,\nsuch derivation is based on the assumption that the production spectra from\nall pulsars have the same slope and Emax . It has been shown recently [9,10]\nthat the expected cosmic ray spectrum in the energy range from PeV to EeV\ncoincides with the observation if the distribution of pulsar initial periods is\nsimilar to the Gamma distribution [9] or if the log of initial pulsar periods and\nsurface magnetic fields are given by the Gaussian distribution [10].\nAn important characteristics of cosmic rays is that they are highly isotropic;\nthe amplitude of anisotropy is less then 10\u22122 below the knee energy region\n[15]. While estimating contribution of a pulsar such isotropic nature of cosmic\nrays has to be respected. But this point has not been taken into consideration\nin several investigations. In most of the recent efforts of estimating cosmic\nrays from pulsars collective contribution of all galactic pulsars are studied [710]. Hence it is not clear from those analysis whether the adopted cosmic ray\nproduction scenario in pulsars is consistent with the observed isotropy of cosmic\nrays or not. Here it is worthwhile to mention that the observed upper limit of\ncosmic ray anisotropy leads to some important conclusions on the supernova\nremnant (SNR) model of origin of cosmic rays as well as on their propagation.\nFor instance in a recent work [16] it is shown that the observed cosmic ray\nisotropy does not support the idea the that only a small fraction of supernova\nremnants provide the main contribution to the cosmic ray flux in the knee region\n[17]. In another work [18] it is found that the SNR origin model of cosmic rays\nis compatible with the observed upper limit of cosmic ray anisotropy if the\ncosmic ray propagation is by diffusion with re-acceleration; the plain diffusion\nmodel of propagation gives too large anisotropy. Thus the study of individual\ncontribution of pulsars, particularly from nearby pulsars, is of great significance.\nIn the context of single source model of the knee [19] contribution of nearby\npulsars to the cosmic ray spectrum at knee region has been studied recently [20]\nwhere parameters are chosen suitably so that the contribution of the pulsars\nbecomes significant at the knee energy of the spectrum. But isotropic nature of\ncosmic rays was not incorporated in those studies. In the present work cosmic\nray flux from nearby pulsars are estimated respecting the observed isotropy of\ncosmic rays.\nThe plan of the work is as follows. After giving a short review of the acceleration\nof charged particles by pulsars, we obtain the cosmic ray spectrum of charged\nparticles produced by a pulsar in sec. II. The contribution of a nearby pulsar to\nthe cosmic rays at the Earth is estimated in section III. In section IV constraint\n2\n\n\fon the contribution of cosmic rays from a point source that may arise from\nthe observed isotropy of cosmic rays are discussed. Fluxes of cosmic rays from\ntwo nearby gamma ray pulsars, the Geminga and Vela pulsars, are estimated in\nsection V. Finally the results are concluded in section VI.\n\n2\n\nAcceleration of nuclei by pulsars\n\nPulsars are generally believed to be rotating neutron stars [21]. The rotation\nof the magnetic dipole of pulsars generates huge electrical differences between\ndifferent parts of its surface and as a result the rotating neutron star should be\nsurrounded with charged plasma, which is called a magnetosphere. Since the\nmoment of inertia of a neutron star is around 1045 erg s2 , a millisecond pulsar\nhas a rotational energy E = 12 I\u03a92 \u223c 1052 ergs. A fraction of such a huge rotational energy of a pulsar may be converted to the kinetic energy of the particles\nthose present in the magnetosphere.\nThe pulsar magnetosphere is usually considered to be composed of electronpositron pairs. They are expected to be produced to get rid of electric fields\nthat are parallel to magnetic fields at a region where net charge density is different from the Goldreich-Julian density [1]. However, hadronic component also\nmay exist [1-12] in magnetosphere. Ions in the magnetosphere of a neutron star\nare most likely to come from the surface of the star. The surface of the neutron\nstar is supposed to compose of heavy nuclei, most probably of iron nuclei [12].\nThe binding energy of these surface nuclei is, however, not accurately known. In\nthe case of small binding energy (< 1 keV ), thermionic emission of ions from the\nsurface of the star is possible even for the old stars which may give practically\nfree outflow of ions in the magnetosphere. But if the binding energy of surface\natoms is large (2 \u2212 3 keV ), thermionic emission can take place only for young\npulsars (surface temperature > 106o C). The local temperature of the polar cap\ncan be higher due to the bombardment by particles of the magnetosphere and\nthus thermionic emission still may occur in pulsars of intermediate age. Surface\natoms also can be stripped off by the strong electric field of the polar cap of a\npulsar [4].\nThese nuclei can be accelerated by pulsars through large potential drop associated with strong electric field parallel to the pulsar magnetic field. Several\ndetailed mechanisms have so far been suggested for accelerating particles by\npulsars including the popular polar gap [4], and the outer gap [5] models. In\nthe former model, acceleration of particles takes place in the open field line region above the magnetic pole of the neutron star whereas in the case of outer\ngap model it occurs in the vacuum gaps between the neutral line and the last\nopen line in the magnetosphere. Thus, the region of acceleration in the polar\ngap model is close to the pulsar surface, while the same in the outer gap model\nis close to the light cylinder. It has also been suggested that pulsars may accelerate protons and heavy nuclei by converting their rotational energy to particle\nkinetic energy via a relativistic MHD winds near the light cylinder [3,7]. In\nthis process particles may gain energy from the largest potential drop associ-\n\n3\n\n\fated with a neutron star. In the present investigation, however, we restrict our\ndiscussion within somewhat general framework of electromagnetic acceleration\nprocess without focusing on any specific model.\n\n2.1\n\nMaximum energy\n\nA large-scale electric field in the magnetosphere is expected to develop due to\nthe rotating magnetic dipole of the pulsar. Neglecting the influence of the pulsar\nmagnetosphere, the maximum electrostatic potential at time t is\n\u03c6m =\n\n1\nBs \u03a92 (t)R3\n2c2\n\n(2)\n\nBut the whole potential drop may not be available for the particle acceleration\ndue to development of electron-positron pair cascades (originate from curvature\nradiation photons emitted by a seed electron accelerated by the drop) in opposite\ndirection which quickly shuts off the potential drop [5, 12, 22].\nIf f fraction of the \u03c6m is responsible for the acceleration process, the energy of\nthe accelerated nuclei would be\n\u00133\n\u00132 \u0012\n\u0012\nR\n\u03a9(t)\ncr\n8\nGeV.\n(3)\nE = 1.7 \u00d7 10 f ZB12\n103 s\u22121\n106 cm\nIn general f may depend on pulsar period and magnetic field. On the other\nhand if we consider the acceleration scenario in which magnetic field energy\nnear the light cylinder is transferred to particle kinetic energy [3,7], the magnetic\nB2\nenergy per ion at the light cylinder is E = 8\u03c0nlcGJ where Blc = Bs R3 \u03a93 /c3 is\nthe magnetic field at the light cylinder and nGJ (r) = Bs R3 \u03a9/(4\u03c0Zecr3 ) is the\nGoldreich-Julian density. Thus the numerical value of the magnetic energy per\nion becomes the same as Eq.(3) with f = 1.\n\n2.2\n\nEnergy spectrum\n\nIn the acceleration picture mentioned above it is natural to consider that at\nany evolutionary stage of the pulsar, all the particles are accelerated under the\nsame potential difference and hence should attain the same maximum energy\nE cr . With the spin down of the pulsar, attainable energy of the accelerated\nparticles changes. If we assume that the \u03be fraction of total rotational energy\nloss of a pulsar goes to accelerate nuclei then one can write the rate of number\nof accelerated particles at any moment\n \u0307\nE rot\ndN\n= \u03be cr s\u22121\ndt\nE\n\n(4)\n\nHowever, the charged density follows from the above equation may not be always\nless than the Goldreich-Julian density (\u03c1 \u2248 \u2212\u03a9B/(2\u03c0c)) [8]. But the expression\nfor the GJ density is valid only in the co-rotation portion of the magnetosphere\n[1,8] whereas the most likely site of production of high-energy cosmic rays is\n4\n\n\fnear the light cylinder. If \u03b7 fraction of total rotational energy loss is due to the\nemission of magnetic dipole radiation, then\nBs2 R6 \u03a94\n6c3\n\n\u03b7I\u03a9\u03a9\u0307 =\n\n(5)\n\nSo one can express the rate of change of rotational energy of a pulsar at any\ninstant t as\n\u00136\n\u00134 \u0012\n\u0012\nR\n\u03a9(t)\n \u0307 = 3.9 \u00d7 1042 \u03b7 \u22121 B 2\nGeV s\u22121\n(6)\nE rot\n12\n103 s\u22121\n106 cm\nThe evolution of the pulsar period is given by the expression\n\u0012\n\u00136 \u0012\n\u0013\u22121\nR\n\u03b7I\n2\n2\n\u221216\n2\nP (t2 ) = P (t1 ) + 4.8 \u00d7 10 (t2 \u2212 t1 )B12\n106 cm\n1045 g cm2\n\n(7)\n\nHere P (t2 ) and P (t1 ) are the period of pulsar in seconds at time t2 and t1\nrespectively. The rate of change of pulsar period at a particular instant t is\nfollowed from the above equation which is given by\n\u0012\n\u00136 \u0012\n\u0013\u22121\n2\nR\n\u03b7I\n\u221216 B12\n(8)\n\u1e56 (t) = 2.4 \u00d7 10\nP (t) 106 cm\n1045 g cm2\nWith the evolution of the pulsar period, the energy of the accelerated particles\nchanges according to Eq.(3) through Eq.

But since the production times for particles of different energies\nare different, the observed spectrum may not go simply as E \u22121 [8].\n\n2.3\n\nEscape from the nebula\n\nA young pulsar is generally encircled by the remnant of the pre supernova star.\nIn fact most gamma ray pulsars have plerions as well as they have associated\nsupernova remnants. Only the oldest pulsars such as Geminga or PSR1055-52\nshow no sign of having plerions. So pulsar accelerated nuclei will inject into the\nnebula. Initially the accelerated nuclei will interact with the dense matter of\nthe expanding envelope. The interactions, however, become negligible when the\ncolumn density is very much less than the interaction length of the energetic\nnuclei in the medium. The column density of the matter in envelope offered\nto the injected high energy nuclei after t years from the birth of the pulsar is\napproximately\n\u0013\u22122 \u0012\n\u0013\u22121\n\u00132 \u0012\n\u0012\nMneb\nESN\nt\nMneb\ng cm\u22122 (10)\n=\n50\n\u03a3(t) \u2243\n2\n4\u03c0Rneb\n1 year\n10 M\u2299\n1051 ergs\n5\n\n\fwhere Mneb and Rneb stand for mass and effective radius during the free expansion phase of the envelope respectively. The radius of the envelope varies\nas Rneb \u2243 Ro + v t where Ro is the radius of pre-supernova star (Ro \u0016 1014\ncm) and the velocity of the free expansion v \u223c (2ESN /Mneb )1/2 , the observations suggest that the free expansion velocity of Crab nebula is around 2000\nKM s\u22121 . The condition for iron nuclei to pass through the envelope without\nmajor losses is that \u03a3 \u0016 100 gcm\u22122 . Thus the energetic nuclei can escape the\nremnant without significant losses shortly after the explosion.\nHowever, energetic nuclei injected into the envelope may be trapped by the magnetic field of the nebula. Outside the light cylinder the azimuthal component\nof the magnetic field dominates over the radial field and is given by\nB(r) \u2243\n\n\u221a\n\u03c3Bs\n\n\u0012\n\nR\nrlc\n\n\u00133\n\nrlc\nr\n\n(11)\n\nwhere \u03c3 is the ratio of the magnetic field flux to the particle energy flux at shock\nradius r. For the Crab pulsar \u03c3 is estimated to be 0.003 [23] whereas for the\nVela pulsar the value of \u03c3 is close to 1 [24]. According to the standard picture\nof development of pulsar envelope [25] at the initial stage envelope expands\nfreely with velocity v. At this stage the radius of the envelope increases with\ntime roughly as 6.3 \u00d7 1015 t cm where t is in years. With time the envelope\nslowly begins to decelerate by transferring its energy to the ambient medium.\nWhen the envelope reaches the Sedov phase, which occurs when the matter\ndensity of the nebula becomes comparable to that of the surrounding medium\nand begins at tsedov \u2243 Rsedov /v where the radius of the envelope at Sedov\n\u0001\nMenv 1/2\n1\nwith n \u2243 0.3 gcm\u22123 being the density of the\nphase Rsedov \u2243 4\u03c0\nn\nsurrounding medium (typically tsedov \u223c 2000 years), the velocity of envelope\ncan be approximated as vsedov = v(tsedov /t)3/5 [26]. Consequently the radius\n3/5\nof the envelope goes with time as rneb \u2243 vtsedov t2/5 . During this stage the\nstrength of the magnetic field in the outer part of the envelope takes a value\naround 3 to 5\u03bcG, the typical value for the interstellar medium. Accordingly, \u0001the\nLarmor radius (rL = E/(ZeB)) in the envelope becomes about 1018 1 PEeV Z1\ncm. Thus, nuclei of energy even 1 PeV should be trapped by the magnetic\nfield of the nebula. However, it is known that several instabilities develop in\nthe process of confinement of charged particles by magnetic fields and the highenergy nuclei will finally escape along the field lines of the irregular fields [8].\nThe energetic nuclei will propagate diffusively in the envelope before escaping\ninto the interstellar medium provided diffusion time \u03c4dif f (\u2261 r2 /4D(E), D(E)\nis the diffusion coefficient) for traversing the radial distance rneb is much larger\nthan \u03c4 = rneb /c, the time required for straight line propagation. When the\nenergy of particles is too high they move on almost rectilinear trajectories. The\npulsar accelerated particles will escape from the nebula when the mean radial\ndistance traveled by the particles becomes comparable with the radius of the\nnebula at the time of escaping. The mean radial distance traveled in diffusive\n\n6\n\n\fpropagation in time t is [27]\n< rrad >= 2\n\nr\n\nD(E)t\n\u03c0\n\n(12)\n\nwhere D(E) is assumed as time independent. Such an assumption holds, at\nleast as first approximation, only after the nebula enters the Sedov phase, as\nthereafter the magnetic field of the nebula does not change appreciably with\ntime. The Diffusion coefficient for relativistic particles is defined by the relation\nD(E) = 13 c\u03bbd , where \u03bbd is the mean scattering length by magnetic irregularities.\nThe problem is that \u03bbd is not known with good accuracy. Theoretical limit on\n\u03bbd is that it cannot be smaller than the Larmor radius [28]. Thus the minimum\nvalue of diffusion coefficient (so-called Bohm diffusion constant) corresponding\nto maximally turbulent medium is given by\nD=\n\n1\ncrL .\n3\n\n(13)\n\nBut after the nebula enters into the Sedov phase the magnetic field fluctuations\nis more likely to represent by the Kolmogorov spectrum [12]. In that case the\ndiffusion coefficient is well described by the relation\nD(E) =\n\n1 1/3 2/3\nr l\n.\n3 L cell\n\n(14)\n\nwhere lcell represents the characteristic size of the magnetic cells (irregularities)\nin the nebula which is obviously less than the radius of the nebula but can be\nwithin an order of that, the characteristic size of filamentary structure of the\nVela supernova remnant as revealed from multiwave length studies indicates\nsuch possibility.\nIt is evident from the foregoing discussion that mean storage time of cosmic rays\nof different energies in the nebula depends on the choice of the diffusion coefficient. But even for the Bohm diffusion, which gives maximum confinement,\nmean storage time of a PeV proton in the nebula is only few hundred years\nwhereas the same for a PeV iron nucleus is few (typically 6 to 10) thousand\nyears.\n\n3\n\nCosmic ray flux from a pulsar to be observed\nat Earth\n\nThe diffusion process governs the propagation of accelerated charged nuclei from\nthe source. Usually the diffusion scenario is considered as Gaussian. Neglecting\nthe effect of energy gained/losses during propagation, convection, losses of nuclei\nby collision and nuclear interactions, the diffusion equation is given by\ndN\n= \u2206.(D(E)\u2206N (r, t, E) + Q(r, t, E)\ndt\n7\n\n(15)\n\n\fwhere Q(r, t, E) represents the source term. The Green's function for the above\nequation is given by\nG=\n\n1\nexp[\u2212r2 /(4Dt)] cm\u22123\n8(\u03c0Dt)3/2\n\n(16)\n\nHere t is the time when cosmic ray of energy E escapes from the pulsar nebula.\nThus the intensity of cosmic rays of energy E at a distance r from a pulsar\nwould be\n\u00133 !\u22122 \u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03b7I\nR\n52\nG(r, \u03c4 )\nf ZB12 \u03a9(t)\nIcr (r, E) = \u03be2.6 \u00d7 10\n106 cm\n1045 g cm2\ncm\u22122 s\u22121 sr\u22121 GeV \u22121 (17)\nwhere c is the speed of light.\n\n4\n\nAnisotropy\n\nThe anisotropy predicted for galactic cosmic ray sources relies on the model for\nthe production of cosmic rays and for their propagation. The production of\ncosmic rays depends on the nature of the sources whereas the diffusion process\ndue to scattering from minor irregularities in the field governs the propagation\nof accelerated charged nuclei from the source to Earth. The resultant amplitude\nof anisotropy is given by [29]\n\u03b4=\n\n\u03bbd \u2202I(E)\nI(E) \u2202r\n\n(18)\n\nwhere I is local cosmic ray intensity and \u2202I/\u2202r is the intensity gradient. Employing the simplified model of diffusion as mentioned in previous section, one\ngets\n3r\n(19)\n\u03b4 = h(E)\n2ct(E)\nHere h(E) denotes the ratio of the cosmic rays of energy E from the source\nto the total observed flux of cosmic rays at the same energy from all sources.\nThe energy dependence of \u03b4 relies mainly on h(E). But emission time and\nhence t also can be different for cosmic rays of different energies depending\non the nature of source. A nice feature of the expression (19) is that it does\nnot depend on the diffusion coefficient. However, if a different propagation\nscenario, such as the so-called anomalous diffusion [30], is adopted then the\nexpression for anisotropy amplitude might depend on the diffusion coefficient.\nHere it should be mentioned that the numerical value of diffusion coefficient\nat concerned energy range is quite uncertain. Another important point is that\nonce the contribution of the source to the total cosmic ray flux is fixed, there is\nno adjustable parameter left in the expression (15).\nAs the observations show that cosmic rays are highly isotropic, \u03b4 is restricted to\n8\n\n\fa small value. For example harmonic analysis of the right ascension distribution\nof cosmic rays gives amplitude of anisotropy upto the knee region is around 10\u22122\nto 10\u22123 [15]. The measurements at the higher energy region suffer from the low\nflux of cosmic rays and thus \u03b4 is less restricted there. While estimating flux\nfrom a point source constraint imposes by the observed anisotropy through the\nEq.(19) has to be respected which in turn may restrict the parameter \u03be. The\nphase of the amplitude of first harmonic is also a quantity of significance; the\ncontribution of a point source to the total cosmic ray intensity needs to be\nconsistent with the observed phase of the amplitude [15].\n\n5\n\nApplication: Cosmic rays from two nearby\ngamma ray pulsars\n\nIn a recent work [8] it has been shown that Gamma ray pulsars of the Galaxy\ncould contribute a significant fraction of the total cosmic ray flux at and above\nknee energy region. However, the contribution of the nearby sources has not\nbeen considered there. Effect of observed bound of cosmic ray anisotropy on the\nparameters involved in acceleration of cosmic rays by pulsars, if any, is expected\nto reveal from the study of contribution of cosmic rays from the nearby pulsars.\nFor pulsars of large distances the effect of different emission (form pulsars)\ntimes of cosmic ray particles having different energies on the observed cosmic\nray spectrum are not significant. This is because in such cases the propagation\ntime is large compared to the life time of the pulsars. The effect of different\ntime of emission could be important only for nearby pulsars. In the following\ncosmic ray fluxes from the two nearby gamma ray pulsars, namely the Vela and\nthe Geminga, are considered. The present analysis is restricted to gamma ray\npulsars only as the emission of gamma rays is a definite signature of presence of\nhigh-energy particles. We take D(E) = Do (E/Z)\u03b4 cm2 s\u22121 (where E is in GeV)\nwith Do = 1.4 \u00d7 1028 for galactic magnetic field and \u03b4 = 1/3 [31] .\n\n5.1\n\nThe Vela Pulsar\n\nVela was found by SAS 2 as the brightest object in the gamma ray sky. It is\ncomparatively close to the Earth and so the surrounding nebula is well studied.\nIts characteristic age is around 10, 000 years with periodicity 89.3 ms, slow down\nrate is 1.25 \u00d7 10\u221213 , and surface magnetic field is around 3.4 \u00d7 1012 Gauss [32].\nThe distance of the object from the Earth is around 500 pc [33] though recent\nworks suggest a smaller value of 300 pc [34].\nThe observed pulsar period and slow down rate are consistent with both the\n\u0011\u22121\n\u00016 \u0010\n\u03b7I\n= 0.24. The initial pulsar period\nEqs. (5), and (8) for 106Rcm\n1045 g cm2\nis estimated as 26.3 ms from Eq.(7). In the framework of the self-sustained\nouter gap model [35] in which f is given by\n\u0012\n\u0013\u221252/21\n\u03a9(t)\n\u22128/7\n\u22124\nf = 1.07 \u00d7 10\nB12 ,\n(20)\n103 s\u22121\n9\n\n\f1e-10\nP\nFe\nObserved all particle\nspectrum (fitted)\n\nCosmic ray flux (cm-2s-1sr-1GeV-1)\n\n1e-11\n1e-12\n1e-13\n1e-14\n1e-15\n1e-16\n1e-17\n1e-18\n1e-19\n1e-20\n1e-21\n1e-22\n1e+3\n\n1e+4\n\n1e+5\n\n1e+6\n\nEnergy (GeV)\n\nFigure 1: Estimated cosmic ray flux from the Vela pulsar\n\nFigure 1: Estimated Cosmic Ray flux from the Vela pulsar\nthe maximum energy would be 30 Z TeV. Since the pulsar is relatively young\nin the case of Bohm diffusion it is likely that the pulsar accelerated cosmic rays\nstill remain confined in the nebula. But if the characteristic size of the magnetic\nirregularities in the nebula is larger than the Larmor radius then the diffusion\ncoefficient will be given by the Eq.(14) and assuming lcell is of the same order to\nthe radius of the nebula (corresponds to minimum confinement) it is found that\nthe mean storage time of a 30 TeV proton is around 3000 years; the same for a\n100 TeV iron nuclei is about 6000 years. Resulting spectra of cosmic rays from\nthe pulsar to be observed at earth are shown in figure 1 for both proton and\niron primaries assuming \u03be = 0.01 and 0.001 respectively. The parameter \u03be is so\nchosen to respect the observed isotropy of cosmic rays. The observed all particle\ncosmic ray (best fitted) spectrum is also given in the figure for comparison.\n\n10\n\n\f5.2\n\nThe Geminga pulsar\n\nAnother pulsar in the area is Geminga (PSR J0633+1746), which is discovered\nby the SAS-2 group [36] and later confirmed by the COS-B group [37], about\n150 pc away from the Earth. Its radial velocity is unknown, but if it were\n200 KM/sec, it could have been within 100 pc of Earth at 340,000 years ago.\nGeminga is a unique object: a highly compressed, spinning neutron star which\ndoes not emit radio waves like the other well-known pulsars. Yet it is a powerful\nsource of pulsating gamma-rays and X-rays. Geminga is now known to be a\nrotation-powered pulsar with period P = 0.237 s, \u1e56 = 1.0975 \u00d7 10\u221214 and\nsurface magnetic field B = 1.6 \u00d7 1012 G [38].\n\n1e-10\n\nCosmic ray flux (cm-2s-1sr-1GeV-1)\n\n1e-11\n1e-12\n1e-13\n1e-14\n1e-15\n1e-16\n\np\nFe\nObserved all particle\nspectrum (fitted)\n\n1e-17\n1e-18\n1e+3\n\n1e+4\n\n1e+5\n\n1e+6\n\nEnergy (GeV)\n\nFigure 2: Estimated cosmic ray flux from the Geminga pulsar\n\nFigure 2: Estimated Cosmic Ray flux from the Geminga pulsar\nSince Geminga is a relatively old pulsar, presence of ions in its magnetosphere is certainly questionable. However, observation of high-energy gamma\nrays from this pulsar indicates the presence of energetic particles in its atmosphere. Besides the non-observation of radio waves from the pulsar suggests\nthat these high-energy particles may not be electrons. Hence it is likely that\nions are present in its magnetosphere; at least one cannot rule out this possibility. Even if sufficient ions are not available in the pulsar atmosphere presently,\none needs to consider the high energy particles which were produced at earlier\nstages. According to Eq.(7), the initial pulsar period is 36.6 ms. Here also we\n\u0011\u22121\n\u00016 \u0010\n\u03b7I\ntake 106Rcm\n= 0.24 which follow from Eq. (5) and is consis45\n2\n10 g cm\ntent with Eq. (8). The maximum energy of the energetic nuclei thus would be\nonly 4Z \u00d7 1013 eV when f is given by Eq.(20). Taking \u03be = 0.1 so that observed\nisotropy is mostly obeyed, we estimate the spectra of cosmic rays from the pul11\n\n\fsar to be observed at earth for proton and iron primaries which are shown in\nfigure 2. Observed (best fitted) all particle spectrum [39] is also presented for\ncomparison. It is worthwhile to mention that for Geminga the nature of diffusion process of cosmic rays in the supernova envelope has little effect on the\nresultant (observed) spectra because of its age.\n\n6\n\nDiscussion\n\nIn the present work contribution of a nearby pulsar to cosmic rays observed\nat earth has been studied respecting the observed isotropy of cosmic rays. It\nis found that the parameters involved in the cosmic ray generation process\nin pulsars, particularly the efficiency of converting pulsar rotational energy to\nemitted particles kinetic energy may be severely constrained by the observed\nlimit on cosmic ray anisotropy. Consequently production of high-energy gamma\nrays through collision of cosmic rays with the ambient matter would be also\nrestricted [40].\nCosmic ray fluxes from two well-known gamma ray pulsars, namely the Vela and\nGeminga pulsars, are obtained. It is found that owing to the observed bound\non cosmic ray anisotropy the contributions of the Vela and the Geminga pulsars\nare limited to at most 1 % of the total cosmic ray intensity below the knee. This\nmeans the Vela and the Geminga pulsars do not contribute substantially to the\ntotal cosmic ray intensity. Such a conclusion is consistent with the observed\nphase of the amplitude of first harmonic; below the knee energy maximum flux\nof cosmic rays (phase of the anisotropy) is observed from the second quadrant\nof the Galaxy [15], while both Vela and Geminga are in the third quadrant.\nAnother interesting observation is that the cosmic ray spectra to be observed at\nEarth from both the pulsars, the Geminga and the Vela, are found noticeably\ndifferent than the production spectra which is mainly due to combined effect\nof different generation (and emission) time of pulsar accelerated cosmic rays of\ndifferent energies and their propagation.\n\nAcknowledgment\nThe author is greatful to an anonymous referee for helpful suggestions.\n\nReferences\n[1] Goldreich, P., Julian, W.
