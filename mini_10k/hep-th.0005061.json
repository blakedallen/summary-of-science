This limiting procedure takes into account all the massless fields\nthat may arise and commutes with the T-duality so that any dual solution has again\na plane wave limit. The scaling rules used in the limit are unique and stem from\nthe scaling property of the D = 11 supergravity action. Although the leading order\ndual solutions need not be exact or supersymmetric, their plane wave limits always\npreserve some portion of the Poincar\u00e9 supersymmetry and solve the relevant field\nequations in all powers of the string tension parameter. Further properties of the\nlimiting procedure are discussed.\n\n\u2217\n\nPermanent Address\n\n1\n\n\u2217\n\n\fIn general relativity there is a remarkably simple argument, due to Penrose [1], which\nshows that any spacetime has a plane wave as a limit. This universal property of the plane\nwave spacetimes can be proven in two steps. For this purpose one first chooses, on an\narbitrary Lorentzian spacetime, a coordinate gauge in a neighborhood of a null geodesic.\nThe coordinate patch chosen in this manner turns out to be governed by the conjugate\npoints of the null geodesic. One then utilizes the homogeneity property of the EinsteinHilbert action under the constant scalings of the metric and blows up the neighborhood\nof the geodesic through the limit. The endpoint of the procedure is always a plane wave\nspacetime which satisfies the Einstein equations if the initial spacetime does.\nIn this paper we wish to study how the Penrose limit is generalized in string theories\nand how it behaves under the T-duality. We shall work within the framework of the lowenergy effective field theories and take into account all possible massless bosonic fields that\nmay arise, including both the Neveu-Schwarz (NS-NS) and the Ramond (R-R) sectors as\nwell as the Yang-Mills (YM) fields. It will be seen that the two inputs of the Penrose limit\nboth have natural generalizations in string theories. The gauge choice employed in the\nlimit must be generalized to incorporate the antisymmetric tensor fields and this can be\ndone in a unified manner, applicable to all string theories . Secondly, the different scaling\nbehaviors that must be imposed on the massless fields to produce the plane waves turn\nout to be rooted in the scaling property of the D=11 supergravity action. Assuming that\nthe D=10 spacetime possesses a spacelike isometry without fixed points, but otherwise\nis arbitrary, we next consider the effect of T-duality on the conjugate points. We find\nthat the conjugate points are left invariant by the duality transformations. From this\nobservation and the invariance of the gauge conditions used, it follows that T-duality\ncommutes with the Penrose limit. Therefore, starting from an arbitrary, leading order\nsolution and its T-dual in any one of the five string theories, one gets in the limit a plane\nwave solution together with its dual plane wave in the dual theory. The fact that the plane\nwave solutions of type I and heterotic string theories can be obtained through the Penrose\nlimit was noted in [2] and a related procedure was employed in [3] to generate new, exact\nsolutions possesing only the NS-NS fields. Within the NS-NS sector, it is also known that\nplane waves constitute a T- duality invariant family when the isometries that correspond\nto the translations along the wave fronts are gauged [4]. Some other interesting aspects\nof the string theory plane waves can be found in [5]-[10] and certain plane wave solutions\nof the Type II theories are reported in [11], [12].\nIt is well known that the leading order terms of the low-energy Lagrangians of the\ntype II string theories are of the from\nL = LN S + LR + LCS ,\nwhere the NS-NS sectors are described by the ten-form\n1\n1\nLN S = 2 e\u22122\u03c6 [\u2212R \u2217 1 + 4d\u03c6 \u2227 \u2217d\u03c6 \u2212 H \u2227 \u2217H],\n2\u03ba10\n2\nand for the R-R sector of the IIA theory one has\n1\nLR = 2 [F2 \u2227 \u2217F2 + F4 \u2227 \u2217F4 ],\n4\u03ba10\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\nwhereas for the IIB theory\nLR = \u2212\n\n1\n1\n[F1 \u2227 \u2217F1 + F3 \u2227 \u2217F3 + F5 \u2227 \u2217F5 ].\n2\n4\u03ba10\n2\n2\n\n(4)\n\n\fHere R is the D=10 scalar curvature in the string frame, \u03c6 is the dilaton, H is the NS-NS\nthree-form: H = dB and a subscript on a R-R field denotes the degree of that form.\nOur spacetime conventions and the Hodge dual * are described in the appendix. The IIA\nR-R field strengths are even degree forms which are defined in terms of the odd degree\npotentials Ap by\nF2 = dA1 ,\nF4 = dA3 + A1 \u2227 H,\n(5)\nwhereas in the IIB theory the even degree potentials Ap give rise to the odd degree R-R\nfield strengths:\nF1 = dA0 ,\nF3 = dA2 + B \u2227 dA0 ,\n1\n1\n1\nF5 = dA4 \u2212 A2 \u2227 dB + B \u2227 dA2 + B \u2227 B \u2227 dA0 .\n2\n2\n2\n\n(6)\n\nThe Chern-Simons terms LCS do not affect the present discussion and are ignored. In the\nIIB theory the field equations that follow from (1) are in harmony with the self-duality\nof the five-form field strength:\nF5 = \u2217F5 ,\n(7)\nbut (7) must be imposed as an additional field equation. For the IIA theory (1) can be\ncompletely derived from the bosonic sector of the D=11 supergravity Lagrangian\nL\u0302 =\n\n1\n1\n1\n[R\u0302\u02c6\u22171 \u2212 F\u0302 \u2227 \u2217\u02c6F\u0302 \u2212 F\u0302 \u2227 F\u0302 \u2227 \u00c2],\n2\n2\u03ba11\n2\n6\n\n(8)\n\nby employing the standard Kaluza-Klein (KK) reduction. In (8) R\u0302 is the scalar curvature\nof the D=11 metric \u011d\u03bc\u0302\u03bd\u0302 and F\u0302 = d\u00c2 is the four-form field.\nFor both the type I and the heterotic strings the leading order terms of the low- energy\nLagrangians can be written as L = L1 + L2 , where L1 has the same form as LN S provided\nthe Chern-Simons three-form of the YM field is included in the definition of H, and L2\nstands for the YM kinetic term with the appropriate gauge group and dilaton coupling\n[13].\nConsider now in the framework of the above Lagrangians the massless fields of any\none of the five string theories. Let us first introduce a coordinate system {Y + , Y \u2212 , Y A }\nwith A = 1, . . . , 8 on the D=10 spacetime M10 so that the string frame metric takes the\nform\nds2 = 2dY + [dY \u2212 + \u03b1dY + + \u03b2A dY A ] \u2212 CAB dY A dY B ,\n(9)\nwhere the metric functions \u03b1, \u03b2A , CAB are in general functions of all the coordinates\nand CAB is a 8 \u00d7 8 positive definite symmetric matrix. Such a coordinate system can\nalways be introduced in a neighborhood of a portion of a null geodesic provided this\nportion contains no conjugate points [14]. These coordinates have the propery that a null\ngeodesic congruence is singled out in which each geodesic is given by Y + , Y A = const. with\nY + labelling the different geodesics and Y \u2212 is an affine parameter along these geodesics.\nThe coordinate system is valid as long as a conjugate point is not encountered and breaks\ndown at the nearest conjugate point where det(CAB ) = 0.\nIn the NS-NS sector (g\u03bc\u03bd , \u03c6, B) one must choose a gauge not only for the D=10 metric\ng\u03bc\u03bd but also for B. Let the components of B be labelled as\nB = B+\u2212 dY + \u2227 dY \u2212 + B+A dY + \u2227 dY A + B\u2212A dY \u2212 \u2227 dY A + 1/2BAB dY A \u2227 dY B . (10)\n3\n\n\fThen the appropriate gauge condition for B turns out to be\nB\u2212A = 0,\n\n(11)\n\nand this can always be imposed in the chosen neighborhood by using the gauge freedom\nB \u2192 B + d\u03c7 with a suitable one-form \u03c7. Each potential Ap in a R-R sector also enjoys a\nsimilar gauge freedom: Ap \u2192 Ap + d\u039bp\u22121 + . . ., involving a (p \u2212 1)-form \u039bp\u22121 and possible\ncompensators that depend on \u03c7 or H and whenever a R-R sector is present, one must\nalso arrange the gauge so that\nA(p) \u2212B1 ...Bp\u22121 = 0,\n(12)\nholds for each potential. Here we are denoting the components of Ap by A\u03bc(p)1 ...\u03bcp in an\nexpansion similar to (10) and p \u2265 1. In the cases where a YM field must be taken into\naccount, the same applies to its Lie algebra-valued potential one-form A:\nA\u2212 = 0,\n\n(13)\n\nwhich means that we are working in the YM gauge: A = A+ dY + + AB dY B . This\ncompletes the first step of limiting procedure because all the gauges are now appropriately chosen. Notice that no restriction is made on the dependence of the fields on the\ncoordinates.\nThe second step of the procedure starts by rescaling the coordinates chosen on the\nneighborhood. Let \u03a9 > 0 be a real number and introduce {U, V, X A } satisfying\nY \u2212 = U,\n\nY + = \u03a92 V,\n\nY A = \u03a9X A .\n\n(14)\n\nWhen the coordinate basis one-forms are written in terms of dU, dV, dX A in (9) and (10)\nbut the components are not transformed, this rescaling gives us a one-parameter family of\nfields (g\u03bc\u03bd (\u03a9), \u03c6(\u03a9), B(\u03a9)) and the same applies to the R-R as well as the YM fields that\nare present. It is useful to view these as fields on a one-parameter family of spacetimes\nM10 (\u03a9). This allows one to interpret \u03a9 as a scalar field on an associated D=11 manifold\npossessing a degenerate metric and a boundary [15]. The boundary of the D=11 manifold\nis located at \u03a9 = 0 which is the limit of interest. Before approaching this boundary let\nus introduce on M10 (\u03a9) new fields that are distinguished by overbars and are related to\nthe old ones by\n\u1e21\u03bc\u03bd (\u03a9) = \u03a9\u22122 g\u03bc\u03bd (\u03a9),\n(15)\n\u03c6\u0304(\u03a9) = \u03c6(\u03a9),\n\n(16)\n\nB\u0304(\u03a9) = \u03a9\u22122 B(\u03a9).\n\n(17)\n\nFor the R-R and the YM fields the scaling rules are\n\u0100p (\u03a9) = \u03a9\u2212p Ap (\u03a9),\n\n(18)\n\n\u0100(\u03a9) = \u03a9\u22121 A(\u03a9),\n\n(19)\n\nso that each potential is scaled according to its form degree. Allowing now \u03a9 \u2192 0, the\noverbarred fields become in the limit:\nds2 = 2dUdV \u2212 CAB (U)dX A dX B ,\n4\n\n(20)\n\n\f\u03c6 = \u03c6(U),\n\n(21)\n\n1\nB = BKL (U)dX K \u2227 dX L + gauge,\n(22)\n2\nwhere we have dropped the overbars for notational convenience. Notice that when \u03a9 \u2192 0\nall the functions appearing in each field depend only on the coordinate U as a consequence\nof (14). This is, of course, valid also for the components of the R-R and YM fields.\nAccording to (5),(6) and (17),(18) a (p+1)-form R-R field strength is scaled as\nF\u0304(p+1) = \u03a9\u2212p F(p+1) ,\n\n(23)\n\nand in the limit the scaled fields take the forms\nAp =\n\n1\nAK ...K (U)dX K1 \u2227 . . . \u2227 dX Kp + gauge,\np! 1 p\n\n(24)\n\n1\nF\u2212A1 ...Ap (U)dU \u2227 dX A1 \u2227 . . . \u2227 dX Ap .\np!\n\n(25)\n\nF(p+1) =\n\nDenoting the YM field strength by F , one also gets in the same limit\nA = AK (U)dX K + gauge,\n\nF = F\u2212K (U)dU \u2227 dX K .\n\n(26)\n\nWhat have been obtained by this limiting procedure are the general representations\nof the plane wave fields in the Rosen coordinates. These coordinates have the virtue of\ndisplaying the isometries but become singular at det(CAB (U)) = 0. This can be remedied\n[16] by transforming all the fields to the harmonic coordinates {u, v, xA }:\nU = u,\n\n1\nV = v \u2212 \u010aAB (U)QA K (U)QB L (U)xK xL ,\n4\n\nX A = QA B (U)xB ,\n\n(27)\n\nwhich covers the whole of the plane wave manifold. Here and in the sequel a dot over\na quantity denotes differentation with respect to its argument. The matrix QA B is such\nthat\nL\nK\nL\nCKL QK A QL B = \u03b4AB ,\nCKL [Q\u0307K\n(28)\nA Q B \u2212 Q A Q\u0307B ] = 0,\nwhere \u03b4AB is the D=8 Kronecker symbol. Defining an 8 \u00d7 8 martix hAB (u) by\nhAB = \u2212[\u010aKL Q\u0307LB + CKL Q\u0308LB ]QK A\n\n(29)\n\nthe spacetime line element (20) takes the standard form\nds2 = 2dudv \u2212 hAB (u)xA xB du2 \u2212 \u03b4AB dxA dxB .\n\n(30)\n\nIn the harmonic coordinates the field strengths (but not the potentials) retain their forms:\n1\nH = HuAB (u)du \u2227 dxA \u2227 dxB ,\n2\n\n(31)\n\n1\nFuA1 ...Ap (u)du \u2227 dxA1 \u2227 . . . \u2227 dxAp ,\np!\n\n(32)\n\n\u03c6 = \u03c6(u),\nF(p+1) =\n\nF = FuA (u)du \u2227 dxA .\n5\n\n(33)\n\n\fIt can be checked that (15)-(19) which led us to the plane waves are the unique scaling\nrules that produce finite, non-zero field strengts. Remarkably, these rules also ensure that\nthe D=10 Lagrangians transform homogeneously:\nL\u0304(\u03a9) = \u03a9\u22128 L(\u03a9),\n\n(34)\n\nand it is possible to absorb \u03a9 into the definition of the coupling constant: \u03ba210 = \u03a98 \u03ba210 . A\nsimilar behavior is encountered in the D=2 \u03c3-model Lagrangian L\u03c3 for the NS-NS fields.\nAs was noted in [3] for a class of fields , L\u0304\u03c3 (\u1fb1\u2032 ) = L\u03c3 (\u03b1\u2032 ) if one defines \u03b1\u2032 = \u03a92 \u1fb1\u2032 where\n\u03b1\u2032 is the string tension parameter. When viewed from the D=11 supergravity framework\nfor the IIA teory, one can see that (15)-(19) are precisely the D=10 consequences of the\nwell known scaling behavior of (8):\n \u0304\nL\u0302 = \u03a9\u22129 L\u0302,\n\n(35)\n\nunder the transformations\n \u0304\n\u00c2 = \u03a9\u22123 \u00c2,\n\n\u011d \u0304\u03bc\u0302\u03bd\u0302 = \u03a9\u22122 \u011d\u03bc\u0302\u03bd\u0302 ,\n\n(36)\n\nand as we shall see below, the IIB theory scaling rules can then be deduced via T-duality.\nAn important consequence of (34) is that, if the fields were chosen intially to satisfy\nthe relevant field equations, then (30)-(33) will again be a solution of the same equations\nafter the limit. In all such cases all the field equations but one will be trivially satisfied\nby the plane waves and the remaining equation will always be a condition on the trace of\nhAB (u), relating it to the other field strengths. For the heterotic strings its precise form\ncan be found in [2] and for IIA and IIB theories this equation will be displayed after we\nconsider the T-duality.\nWe have thus seen that any leading order solution in any of the five string theories\ngoes over to a plane wave solution in the limit. The plane wave family itself is closed\nunder this procedure because, the limit of a plane wave is always a plane wave [15]. The\nlimiting procedure, of course, makes no reference to a symmetry of the spacetime and (9)\nneed not have any Killing vectors. Suppose now we assume that the initial M10 admits a\nspacelike Killing vector K \u03bc which has no fixed points. In such a situation one would like\nto know whether the Penrose limit can be tried simultaneously on a given solution and\nits T-dual and whether the limit of the dual solution is also a plane wave. Since T-duality\ncan even lead to a topology change, it is not clear from the outset that the limit can be\napplied also to a dual solution to get another plane wave. To proceed further one needs to\nunderstand the dual patch and see whether the same type of gauges can be implemented\non the dual fields. If the gauge conditions are preserved, then clearly duality will commute\nwith the Penrose limit and the dual of a plane wave will always be a plane wave.\nTherefore, let us start by considering the NS-NS sector and assume that the action of\n\u03bc\nK on the fields is specified in the standard manner [17], [18]. The T-duality transformations of the NS-NS fields [19] take a simple form when the fields are decomposed relative\nto K \u03bc in a KK fashion [20]. Let us introduce \u03bb2 = \u2212K\u03bc K \u03bc and denote by y the Killing\ncoordinate: Y A = {Y j , y}, j = 1, . . . , 7. Then the metric (9) can be decomposed as\nds2(10) = ds2 \u2212 \u03bb2 (dy + \u03c9)2 ,\n\n(37)\n\nwhere ds2 is the D=9 KK metric and \u03c9 = \u03c9+ dY + + \u03c9j dY j is the twist potential. Notice\nthat due to our gauge choice in (9), \u03c9\u2212 = 0 and therefore, the twist potential obeys a\n6\n\n\fgauge condition which is in perfect harmony with (11)-(13). We next define the one-form\nb = By+ dY + + Byj dY j and write\nB (10) = B + dy \u2227 b.\n\n(38)\n\nFrom now on, whenever there is a need to distinguish the D=10 fields from their D=9\ndescendants, our labelling of the D = 10 fields will be as in (37) or (38) with either a\nsubscript or a superscript. In terms of the D=9 fields defined above it can be easily seen\nthat T-duality leaves the KK metric invariant and acts on the remaining NS-NS fields as\n\u03bb\u0303 = \u03bb\u22121 ,\n\n\u03c9\u0303 = b,\n\nb\u0303 = \u03c9,\n\nB\u0303 = B + b \u2227 \u03c9,\n\n\u03c6\u0303 = \u03c6 \u2212 ln \u03bb,\n\n(39)\n\nwhere tilde denotes the T-dual of a field.\nUsing these transformation rules and keeping in mind that the dual manifold M\u030310\npossesses a new Killing coordinate \u1ef9 : \u1ef8 A = {Y j , \u1ef9}, it is useful to note first that, in\nstring theory, a gauge choice for the axion potential must necessarily accompany the gauge\nchoice for the metric. This is forced upon us by T-duality because, unless the gauge for\nB (10) is chosen as in (11), the dual D=10 metric does not have the form of (9) which is\nsuitable for the limit. More precisely, among the components of (11) it is the vanishing\nof By\u2212 \u2261 b\u2212 which ensures the form invariance of the dual metric. Since the dual metric\nhas the same form in our gauge, it remains to see how the dual patch is related to the\noriginal one. This is also necessary because, although the KK metric is left invariant,\nduality maps CAB to a new matrix C\u0303AB that contains contributions of \u03c9 and b and the\nlocations of the dual conjugate points may have changed. However, one finds that\ndet(C\u0303AB ) = \u03bb\u22124 det(CAB ),\n\n(40)\n\nand consequently, both patches have the same conjugate points. Notice that (40) is\nequivalent to the invariance of det(CAB ) relative to the Einstein frame whose metric is\nE\ng\u03bc\u03bd\n= e\u2212\u03c6/2 g\u03bc\u03bd .\nBecause \u03c9\u2212 = 0, we now see that the gauge conditions in the NS-NS sector are\npreserved by the duality transformations. This property turns out to be universal for\nall the massless fields that may be present. Consider, for example, the YM field whose\nT-duality transformation has been studied in various contexts [21] - [23]. For definiteness\nlet us set\nA(10) = A + \u03bbdyA0,\n(41)\n\nand concentrate on the mapping that one gets by gauging of the isometry of the heterotic\n\u03c3-model action [21]. In this framework A transforms as\n\u00c30 = A0 ,\n\n\u00c3 = A + (\u03bb\u22121 b \u2212 \u03bb\u03c9)A0,\n\n(42)\n\nand therefore, \u00c3(10) also obeys the gauge condition (13). One can check that the same\nconclusion is reached when the transformation rule of [22] or [23] is considered. Hence in\nall these cases the inclusion of the YM Chern-Simons term in H turns out to be of no\nconsequence for our purpose and the limit of both F\u0303 and H\u0303 have again the plane wave\nforms.\nWe next cosider the R-R sector. The transformations of the R-R fields [24] can be\nconveniently displayed also by using the 9 +1 decomposition. Following [25] we define\nthe D=9 fields\nF2 (10) = F2 + F1 \u2227 (dy + \u03c9),\n\nF4 (10) = F4 + F3 \u2227 (dy + \u03c9),\n7\n\n(43)\n\n\ffor the IIA theory. For the IIB theory the correspoding decompositions are\nF1 (10) = F1 ,\n\nF3 (10) = F3 + F2 \u2227 (dy + \u03c9),\n\nF5 (10) = F5 + F4 \u2227 (dy + \u03c9).\n\n(44)\n\nIn terms of the D=9 quantities the T-duality rules which map the IIA theory into IIB\ntheory are then\nF\u03031 = \u2212F1 ,\n\nF\u03032 = F2 ,\n\nF\u03033 = \u2212F3 ,\n\nF\u03034 = F4 ,\n\n(45)\n\ntogether with the rule that F\u03035 is the D=9 dual of F\u03034 . Since these rules only involve \u03c9\nand the R-R field strengths of the IIA theory that one started with, it is obvious that\nthe gauge choices are preseved also within the R-R sector. Notice that one can also infer\nthe scaling rules (16)-(18) for the IIB fields from those of the IIA theory by invoking the\nduality (45).\nIt therefore follows that if one starts with a set of IIA fields and finds the Penrose\nlimit, then the limit of the dual set of fields in the IIB theory will be simply the dual of\nthe plane waves obtained in the IIA theory. Because the two Killing coordinates need not\nbe the same, one needs two different D =10 harmonic coordinates to describe such a dual\npair of plane waves. One can, of course, always use the same D=9 harmonic coordinates\non both of the solutions. We shall display the general forms of a IIA - IIB dual pair in\nsuch coordinates. For example, without any loss of generality the metric that one obtains\nfrom (9) for the IIA theory can be brought to the form\nds2 = 2dudv \u2212 hij (u)xi xj du2 \u2212 \u03b4ij dxi dxj \u2212 (da \u2212 \u03b3du)2 ,\n\n(46)\n\nwhere a is a new Killing coordinate: K \u03bc = \u2212\u03bb\u03b4 \u03bc a and \u03b3 is a function which depends\nlinearly on all the transverse coordinates xA = {xj , a}:\n\u03b3 = \u03b3A (u)xA .\n\n(47)\n\nHere \u03b3A (u) is completely characterized by the norm and the twist of the Killing one-form\nK = K\u03bc dx\u03bc . Noting that K \u2227 dK = \u03bb2 K \u2227 d\u03c9 still holds after \u03a9 \u2192 0 and writing\nd\u03c9 = \u03c9\u0307j (u)du \u2227 dxj in the harmonic coordinates, one gets\n\u03b3A = {\u03bb\u03c9\u0307j , \u03bb\u0307/\u03bb}.\n\n(48)\n\nThe dual of this metric, for example, in the IIB theory is obtained simply by dualizing\nthe Killing coordinate and \u03b3:\nds\u03032 = 2dudv \u2212 hij (u)xi xj du2 \u2212 \u03b4ij dxi dxj \u2212 (d\u00e3 \u2212 \u03b3\u0303du)2 ,\n\n(49)\n\n\u03b3\u0303A = {\u03bb\u22121 \u1e03j (u), \u2212\u03bb\u0307/\u03bb},\n\n(50)\n\n1\nH = pjk (u)du \u2227 dxj \u2227 dxk + \u03bb\u22121 \u1e03j (u)du \u2227 da \u2227 dxj ,\n2\n\n(51)\n\n1\nH\u0303 = pjk (u)du \u2227 dxj \u2227 dxk + \u03bb\u03c9\u0307j (u)du \u2227 d\u00e3 \u2227 dxj ,\n2\n\n(52)\n\nwhere\nand \u1e03j are defined by db = \u1e03j (u)du \u2227 dxj . The dual NS-NS three-forms are given by\n\n8\n\n\fwhere pjk (u) are arbitrary functions. The dilaton \u03c6 is again an arbitrary function of u\nand \u03c6\u0303 = \u03c6 \u2212 ln \u03bb.\nThe R-R field strengths also have a similar structure. Provided p \u2265 2, a D = 10 R-R\np-form field strength has the form\n1\n1\nf (p) j1 ...jp\u22121 du\u2227dxj1 \u2227. . .\u2227dxjp\u22121 +\nk (p) j1 ...jp\u22122 du\u2227da\u2227dxj1 \u2227. . .\u2227dxjp\u22122 ,\n(p \u2212 1)!\n(p \u2212 2)!\n(53)\n(p)\n(p)\nwith arbitrary amplitudes fj1 ...jp\u22121 (u) and kj1 ...jp\u22122 (u), and the remaining case is simply:\nF1 = f (1) du where f (1) (u) = \u02260 (u). In this notation a set type IIB R-R plane wave fields\nwill be the T-dual of its IIA counterpart if\n\nFp =\n\nf \u0303(1) (u) = \u2212k (2) (u),\n\n(3)\n\nk\u0303j (u) = f (2) j (u),\n\n(3)\nf \u0303jk (u) = \u2212k (4) jk (u),\n\n(5)\n\nk\u0303jkl (u) = f (4) jkl (u).\n(54)\nIn order to satisfy the self-duality condition (7), the remaining D = 9 field of the IIB\ntheory must obey\n1\n(5)\n(5)\nf \u0303jklm = \u01ebjklm noi k\u0303noi ,\n(55)\n3!\n(5)\n\nwhich means that it is the dual of k\u0303ijk in the D=7 flat transverse space.\nA characteristics of the plane waves is the vanishing of all the scalar invariants that one\ncan construct from the field strengths and this is, of course, shared by all the above field\nstrengths. Moreover, all the field strengths are both closed and co-closed under exterior\ndifferentiation. The exterior product of a field strength with another field strength or\nits Hodge dual is always zero. Due these properties, all the field equations of IIA or IIB\ntheory, excepting the Guu component of the Einstein equations are automatically satisfied.\nFor example, in the IIA theory the only implication of the field equations is that\nhjj = 2\u03c6\u0308 \u2212\n\n\u03bb\u0308 \u03bb2\n1\n1\n1\n\u2212 \u03c9\u0307j \u03c9\u0307j \u2212 2 \u1e03j \u1e03j \u2212 pjk pjk \u2212 e2\u03c6 [Ramond],\n\u03bb\n2\n2\u03bb\n4\n2\n\n(56)\n\nwhere Ramond denotes the contributions of the R-R sector:\n1\n1\nRamond = (k (2) )2 + f (2) j f (2) j + k (4) ij k (4) ij + f (4) jkl f (4) jkl,\n2\n6\n\n(57)\n\nand this fixes the trace of hjk (u) in terms of the other fields. Here the trace and the other\nsums refer to the metric \u03b4jk on the D=7 flat transverse space.\nThere are two points worth noting in (56). First, one can infer from (56) that the most\ngeneral type IIA (or IIB) plane wave solution involves a total of 128 arbitrary functions.\nHalf of these always belong to the NS-NS sector and the remaining 64 functions come\nfrom the R-R sector. These numbers are precisely the numbers of degrees of freedom of\nthe massless states in the first quantized type II string theories. Secondly, (56) shows\nthat, with the above assumptions about the isometry, plane waves constitute a T-duality\ninvariant family. This result was already known [4] within the NS-NS sector where hjk\nand pjk are inert to duality and the dual roles of \u03c6 and \u03bb as well as of \u03c9\u0307j and \u1e03j are\nmanifest. Because (54) and (55) hold, the duality invariance of the R-R sector is also now\nmanifest.\nSome particular choices of the arbitrary functions appearing in (56) lead to interesting\ngeneralizations of the well known solutions. One such class is the case of the sandwich\n9\n\n\fwaves [16] where all the amplitutes are taken to be non-zero only over a finite interval\nof u. This leads to a spacetime in which two flat regions are connected by plane waves\nof finite duration. It would be interesting to see how the boundary state formalism for\nthe D-branes can be applied on such a geometry. Another class is obtained by choosing\nall the amplitudes to be constants so that u is also a global Killing coordinate and hjk =\nc\u03b4jk , where c is a constant determined by (56). With these assumptions one gets a\ngeneralization of the Nappi-Witten solution [7] to D=10 and to a non-zero R-R sector. In\nthis case the NS-NS sector of the solution corresponds to a WZNW model based on the\nten-dimensional Heisenberg group [26].\nNotice that although a spacelike isometry is initially an additional assumption, this\ndoes not entail an additional symmetry on the spacetime that one gets through the limit.\nViewed after the limit, the Killing vector K \u03bc is simply a member of the 17-parameter\ngroup of motions of the D= 10 plane wave spacetimes. If the orbits of K \u03bc are assumed to\nbe not compact, which is the case of the usual plane waves, M10 as well as its dual has the\nstandard R10 topology after the limit. In this case duality is just a mapping between two\ndifferent sets of solutions. When K \u03bc has compact orbits so that the quantum equivalence\nof the underlying string theories can be considered, the manifold M10 that one obtains\nby the limit has the R9 \u00d7 S 1 topology and moreover, dualization does not bring in a\ntwist at the field theory level. In other words, after the limit the dual manifold has again\nthe R9 \u00d7 S 1 topology. Since the topological properties are not hereditary properties in\nthe sense of [15], a particular topology for M10 need not be assumed prior to the limit\nin the non-compact case. In the case of a compact isometry, one must start with\n\u221a a\n1\nM10 = M9 \u00d7 S , where the topolgy of M9 is initially unspecified but y \u2261 y +\u221a\n2\u03c0 \u03b1\u2032 Rb\n1\n\u2032\non S . Letting y = \u03a9x and noting that \u03b1 also scales, this implies x \u2261 x + 2\u03c0 \u1fb1\u2032 Rb on\nthe plane wave Killing coordinate x. In the coordinate\n\u221a system of (46) this identification\ncorresponds to a \"local compactification\": a \u2261 a + 2\u03c0 \u1fb1\u2032 \u03bb(u)Rb .\nIn type I and heterotic theories plane waves are known to be exact solutions which\npreserve half of the Poincar\u00e9 supersymmetry [2],[5], [6]. These plane waves therefore\nsatisfy the field equations not only at the leading order but in all orders of \u03b1\u2032 . Moreover,\ntheir behavior under the T-duality is not affected by the higher order \u03b1\u2032 corrections to\nthe Buscher rules [21]. When the self-dual five-form is switched off, type IIB plane waves\nare also exact solutions [12]. The plane waves of the IIA theory, on the other hand, are\nknown to admit at least chiral Killing spinors which preserve again 1/2 supersymmetry\n[11]. These Killing spinors do not depend on the Killing coordinate used in duality and\nconsequently, one can conclude that the plane wave duals in the IIB theory are also\nsupersymmetric [9]. Since the solutions on which the limit is applied are not necessarily\nexact, supersymmetric or have exact T-duals, it is clear that the absence of these basic\nproperties are not hereditary. The presence of any one of these properties in an initial\nconfiguration is, of course, hereditary.\n\nAppendix\nOur conventions are as follows: In all D \u2265 2 we use the \"mostly minus\" signature\n(+, \u2212, . . . , \u2212) and the orientation \u01eb012...D\u22121 = 1.
