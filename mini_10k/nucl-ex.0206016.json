Introduction\nIt is predicted by theoretical calculations that highly excited and dense hadronic matter\nundergoes a phase transition from a hadronic gas to a deconfined state of quarks and gluons\ncalled a Quark Gluon Plasma (QGP) [ 1]. A few \u03bcs after the Big Bang [ 2], before nuclei\nand atoms were formed, the very hot and baryon free early universe may have existed in\nsuch a state of deconfinement.\nThe objective of relativistic heavy-ion physics is to produce an energy density in the\noverlap region between two colliding ions that is high enough to probe the phase transition\nbetween hadronic matter and quark matter. The quarks and gluons coexisting in a QGP state\ncannot be measured directly. The experimental challenge is to study a suite of observables\nthat are indirect probes of plasma formation. The one observable that is measured and\ndiscussed here are the transverse momentum (pT ) spectra of produced hadrons, namely:\npions, kaons and (anti)protons. Unlike photons and dileptons, the hadrons decouple late in\nthe reaction due to strong interactions; therefore, the momentum spectra are sensitive to the\nsystem at freezeout.\n\n\f22\n\nJ.M. Burward-Hoy\n\nIf the collision can be described as an expanding, relativistic fluid, then hydrodynamic\nmodels with various equations of state can be used to predict the hadron spectra [ 3]. If both\nhydrodynamic behavior and longitudinal boost invariance are assumed, then the amount of\nexpansion generated in the collision can be extracted from the data at low momenta (pT <\n1.0 GeV/c) using a hydrodynamics-inspired parameterization. Previously, the expansion\nof matter in Pb+Pb collisions at CERN SPS energies was similarly obtained from hadron\nspectra and HBT data [ 4, 5]. In addition, the measured yield of high pT hadrons may\nreveal the amount of partonic energy loss when compared to calculations in perturbative\nQuantum Chromodynamics (pQCD) parton models [ 6, 7].\nThe hadrons from Au+Au collisions at a roughly ten times higher energy density are\nmeasured at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at Brookhaven National Laboratory\n(BNL). The PHENIX experiment at RHIC is described briefly in Section 2.\nIn the first year of data taking, the identified charged hadrons produced in five different event centralities at the collision energy of 130 GeV in Au+Au collisions are measured:\n0\u20135%, 5\u201315%, 15\u201330%, 30\u201360% and 60\u201392% of the total inelastic cross section of 6.8 b.\nThe data reduction, corrections, extrapolations, and systematic uncertainties are summarized in Section 3. The centrality selected spectra, yields, mean transverse momenta (hpT i),\nand total charged multiplicity are presented in Section 4. An interpretation of the data based\non radial, hydrodynamic expansion is provided in Section 5. The implications of the results\nare discussed in Section 6.\n\n2. Experiment\n2.1. The PHENIX detector\nThe PHENIX [ 8, 9, 10] detector is designed for the measurement of e, \u03bc, \u03b3, and identified\nhadrons over a large momentum range for pT > 0.2 GeV/c. It is comprised of four spectrometer arms: two at mid-rapidity called the central arms (\"east\" and \"west\") and two at\nmore forward rapidities called the muon arms (\"north\" and \"south\"). The central arm acceptance is |\u03b7| < 0.35 with each arm subtending \u03c0/2 in azimuthal angle (\u03c6). In the first year\nof physics running in 2000 (Run-1), half of the central arm detectors were instrumented, as\nshown in Fig. 1.\nThe two types of collision axis detectors, the Zero Degree Calorimeters (ZDC) and\nthe Beam\u2013Beam Counters (BBC) measure both the initial time and vertex position of each\nevent. The ZDC resolution was \u03c3E /E < 20% at the single neutron energy of En = 100 GeV\nwith an acceptance of |\u03b7| > 6. The BBC resolution was \u03c3z = 1.5 cm along the beam axis\nand \u03c3t = 70 ps in timing, with an acceptance of 3.0 < \u03b7 < 3.9.\nThe time-of-flight detector (TOF) in the east arm subtends \u03c0/4 in \u03c6 and was used\nfor the identification of \u03c0\u00b1 , K\u00b1 , and (anti)protons. The TOF measures the arrival time of\ncharged hadrons at the TOF wall positioned 510 cm from the collision vertex. In Run-1, a\ntiming resolution of 115 ps was obtained.\nIn Run-1, PHENIX had two layers of multi-wire proportional chambers with padreadout (PC1, PC3) that measure a three-dimensional space point of a charged track. The\npoints from PC1 are used in the global track reconstruction to determine the polar angle\n\n\fCentrality Dependence of Inclusive Identified Hadrons in PHENIX\n\n23\n\nPHENIX Detector - First Year Physics Run\nPC3\nTEC\n\nCentral\nMagnet\n\nPbSc\n\nInstalled\nActive\n\nPbSc\n\nPbSc\n\nPbSc\nDC\n\nDC\nRICH\n\nRICH\nBB\n\nPbSc\n\nPbGl\nMVD\n\nPbSc\n\nPC1\n\nPC1\n\nPbGl\n\nTOF\n\nWest\n\nBeamView\n\nEast\n\nFig. 1.

The PC3 positioned in the east arm is used to minimize the background\ncontribution of albedo and non-vertex decay particles; it is used in the high-pT charged\nhadron analysis [ 7].\nThe drift chambers measure the track curvature between 202 and 246 cm radially, for\nwhich the particle momentum is determined. In Run-1, a resolution of \u03c3 p /p = 0.6%\u22953.6%\nwas obtained. The absolute momentum scale was known better than 2%.\n\n3. Data Reduction and Analysis\n3.1. Event sample\n\u221a\nA total of 5M minimum bias triggers were recorded at sNN = 130 GeV in the PHENIX\nZDC detectors. The event centrality was determined using a correlation measurement\nbetween the neutral energy deposited in the ZDCs and fast charged particles (\u03b2 \u2265 0.69)\nrecorded in the BBCs [ 11]. In order to minimize the amount of albedo from the central\nmagnet pole faces, positioned at \u00b140 cm, only those events with a vertex distribution within\n\u00b130 cm were selected. Additional event criteria include the magnetic field setting and detector stability. The resulting event sample, 140 000 minimum bias events, was 92 \u00b1 4%\nof the total inelastic cross section of 6.8 b [ 11]. The events were subdivided into five\ncentrality classes: 0\u20135%, 5\u201315%, 15\u201330%, 30\u201360% and 60\u201392% of the total geometric\ncross section. In each centrality selection, the number of participating nucleons (Npart ) and\n\n\f24\n\nJ.M. Burward-Hoy\n\nnumber of binary nucleon\u2013nucleon collisions (Ncoll ) were determined using a Monte Carlo\nGlauber model calculation [ 12].\n\n3.2. Particle identification\nParticle identification for charged hadrons was performed by combining the information\nfrom the tracking detectors with the timing information from the BBC and the TOF. Tracks\nat 1 GeV/c in momentum point to the TOF with a projected resolution \u03c3proj of 5 mrad in\nazimuthal angle and 2 cm along the beam axis. Tracks that point to the TOF with less than\n2.0 \u03c3proj were selected.\nThe measured momentum (p), path length (L), and time of flight (t) in the spectrometer\nwere used to calculate the particle mass, with \u03b2 = L/ct in Eq. (1).\n\"\u0012 \u0013\n#\n2\n1\nm2 = p 2\n\u22121 .\n(1)\n\u03b2\nThe width of the mass-squared distribution \u03c3m2 was calculated as a function of momentum,\nusing the known detector resolutions and the relation in Eq. (2),\n\u0012\n\u0013\nm20\nm4\n2\n4\n2\n(2)\n\u03c3m2 = C1 * 4 m 1 + 2 + C2 2 * 4 20 + C3 2 * [4p2(m20 + p2)] .\np\np\nThe constants are related to the measured drift chamber momentum resolution (C1 , C2 ) and\ncombined flight path length and flight time errors (C3 ). Tracks that fell within 2\u03c3m2 of a\nmeasured mass centroid were identified.\n\n3.3. Corrections\nThe raw spectra include inefficiencies from detector acceptance, resolution, particle decays in flight and track reconstruction. Corrections for these effects were determined using\na Monte Carlo simulation of the detector response. The baseline efficiencies were determined by simulating and reconstructing single hadrons. Multiplicity dependent effects\nwere evaluated by embedding simulated single hadrons into real events, and measuring the\ndegradation of the reconstruction efficiency. For each hadron, sufficient statistics were generated flat in azimuthal angle and rapidity for |y| < 0.5 for every measured pT -bin such that\nthe statistical error in the data dominates. The statistical errors from the correction factors\nwere added in quadrature to the statistical errors in the data. Corrections for feed-down\nfrom weak decays were not applied, but an upper limit is estimated based on a MC simulation of \u039b particles within the PHENIX acceptance. More details on the corrections are\nreported elsewhere [ 13, 14].\n\n3.4. Extrapolations\nThe yield integrated over transverse momentum, dN/dy, and the integrated average transverse momentum, hpT i, were determined for each particle after fitting and integrating func-\n\n\fCentrality Dependence of Inclusive Identified Hadrons in PHENIX\n\n25\n\ntions that describe the spectral shape. A power-law and mT exponential were fit to the pion\ndata, while pT and mT exponentials were fit to each kaon and proton spectrum.\n\n3.5. Systematic uncertainties\nThe overall uncertainty on dN/dy is 13%, 15% and 14% for pions, kaons and protons,\nrespectively. Uncertainties on hpT i depend on the extrapolation and background uncertainties; the uncertainties are 7%, 10% and 8% for pions, kaons and protons, respectively.

The dashed lines are the systematic uncertainties in the Glauber model\ncalculation of the number of participant nucleons. The kaons and (anti)protons are scaled\nfor clarity. The error bars include both statistical and systematic errors.\nThe mean transverse momentum increases with the number of participant nucleons\nby 20 \u00b1 5% for pions and protons, as shown in Fig. 5. The hpT i of particles produced\nin p\u2013p and p\u2013p collisions, interpolated to RHIC energies, are consistent with the most\nperipheral pion and kaon data; however, the hpT i of protons produced in Au+Au collisions\nis significantly higher. This dependence on the number of participant nucleons may be due\nto radial expansion.\n\n4.3.

Parameterization\nRadial flow would impart a velocity boost to the hadrons. Heavy particles should be\nboosted to higher pT , depleting the cross section at lower pT , and resulting in a higher\ninverse slope in the spectrum. In order to measure the amount of radial expansion, a hydrodynamics inspired parameterization is used to fit all spectra simultaneously. The functional\nform used describes a boosted thermal source, and is based on relativistic hydrodynamics,\nsee U. Heinz et al. in [ 15]. The particles are assumed to collectively expand with a velocity\nprofile that is linear with the radial position. The particle density distribution is assumed to\nbe a Gaussian in the radial position. In addition to longitudinal boost invariance, it is also\nassumed that all particles decouple kinematically on the freezeout hypersurface at the same\nfreezeout temperature Tfo . The transverse velocity profile is parameterized as:\n\u03b2T (\u03be) = \u03b2s \u03ben ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03be = r/R, \u03b2s is the surface velocity, n is the profile, and R is the radius of the expanding source at freezeout (0 < \u03be < 1 in the case of a flat particle density distribution) [\n16]. Each fluid element is locally thermalized and is given a transverse rapidity boost \u03c1\nthat depends on the radial position as:\n\u03c1 = \u03ben tanh\u22121 (\u03b2s ) .\n\n(4)\n\n\fCentrality Dependence of Inclusive Identified Hadrons in PHENIX\n\n29\n\nThe mT dependence of the yield dN/mT dmT is calculated after integrating over the azimuthal, rapidity, and a final numerical integration over the radial components of the source\n\u0012\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\nZ\ndN\nmT cosh(\u03c1)\npT sinh(\u03c1)\n= A mT f (\u03be)K1\nI0\n\u03bed\u03be ,\n(5)\nmT dmT\nTfo\nTfo\nusing the modified Bessel functions I0 and K1 . The parameters in Eq. (5) are the freezeout\ntemperature Tfo , the normalization A and the maximum surface velocity \u03b2s . A linear velocity profile (n = 1) within the source is used. This choice was guided by the profile observed\nin a full hydrodynamical calculation by Kolb and Heinz.b\n\n5.2. Simultaneous fits to data\nThe amount of radial expansion is determined by fitting all particle transverse momentum\nspectra simultaneously using Eq. (5) for pT < 1.0 GeV/c. We make a grid of combinations\nof temperature and velocity, and perform a chi-squared minimization to extract the normalization, A, for each particle type. The fit is done simultaneously for all particles, with \u03c72\ncontours that show the anti-correlation of temperature and velocity. The resonance region\nin the pion spectra is excluded in the fit,b as was done in S+S collisions at the CERN SPS\n[ 20]. The resulting fits are plotted with the spectra for all centralities in Fig. 7.\nWe find that the transverse momentum distributions are consistent with an expanding\nsystem with a surface velocity of \u03b2s = 0.72 \u00b1 0.01 which decouple at a common temperature of Tfo = 122 \u00b1 4 MeV. For the 5\u201315% centrality, the fit results are Tfo = 125 \u00b1 2 MeV\nand \u03b2s = 0.69 \u00b1 0.01.\nIn [ 7], the hadron multiplicities at high pT are different for mesons and baryons. The\nsuppression of pion yields at high pT and the boost of low pT protons to high pT from\nradial flow may explain the dominant proton and antiproton yields at pT > 1.5 GeV/c and\n1.8 GeV/c, respectively.\n\n5.3. Systematic uncertainties\nWe find that Eq. (5) is consistent with a full hydrodynamic calculation when a linear velocity profile is used [ 14]. Nevertheless, a parabolic profile results in an increase of \u224813%\nin \u03b2s and \u22485% in Tfo . A constant particle density distribution used with a linear velocity\nprofile decreases \u03b2s by \u22482% with a negligible difference in the temperature Tfo . As a test\nof the assumption that all the particles freezeout at a common temperature, the simultaneous fits were repeated for pions and protons only. The difference in Tfo is negligible\nwithin the measured uncertainties. The effect of including the pion resonance region in the\nsimultaneous fit decreases Tfo by 20 MeV.\n\n6. Conclusions\nIdentified charged hadrons produced in Au+Au collisions at 130 GeV in five different centrality selections have been measured. Proton and antiproton yields at high pT dominate\n\n\f30\n\nJ.M.
