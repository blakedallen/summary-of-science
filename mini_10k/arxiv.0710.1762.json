Introduction and Motivation\nOur aim is to compute the static potential for the hybrid quark-antiquark-gluon system. In\nprinciple any Wilson loop with a geometry similar to the one in Fig. 1 and describing correctly\nthe quantum numbers of the hybrid is adequate, although the signal to noise ratio may depend in\nthe choice of the Wilson loop. A correct Wilson loop must include a SU(3) octet, the gluon, a\nSU(3) triplet, the quark and a SU(3) anti-triplet, the antiquark. It must also include the connection\nbetween the three links of the gluon, the quark and the antiquark.\nIn the limit of infinite quark mass, a nonrelativistic potential V can be derived from the large\ntime behaviour of euclidean time propagators. Typically, one has a meson operator O and computes\nthe Green function,\nh0| O(t) O(0) |0i \u2212\u2192 exp{\u2212V t}\n(1.1)\nfor large t. Different types of operators allow the definition of different potentials. In the static\ngluon-quark-antiquark interaction, the static gluon can be replaced by a static quark-antiquark pair\nin a colour octet representation. In this way, we can construct the gluon-quark-antiquark Wilson\nloop starting from the mesonic operator,\nO(x) =\n\nih\ni\n1h\nq(x) \u03bb a \u03931 q(x) q(x) \u03bb a \u03932 q(x) ,\n4\n\n(1.2)\n\nwhere \u0393i are spinor matrices. Using the lattice links to comply with gauge invariance, the second\noperator in eq. (1.2) can be made nonlocal to separate the quark and the antiquark from the gluon,\nO(x) =\n\ni\n1h\nq(x) \u03bb a \u03931 q(x)\nh4\n\nq(x \u2212 r1 \u03bc\u03021 )U\u03bc1 (x \u2212 r1 \u03bc\u03021 ) * * *U\u03bc1 (x \u2212 \u03bc\u03021 )\n\n\u03bb a \u03932 U\u03bc2 (x) * * *U\u03bc2 (x + (r2 \u2212 1)\u03bc\u03022 )\ni\nq(x + r2 \u03bc\u03022 ) .\n\n(1.3)\n\nThe nonrelativistic potential requires the computation of the Green functions present in eq. (1.1).\nAssuming that all quarks are of different nature, the contraction of the quark field operators gives\nrise to the gluon operator,\nWO =\n\n1 n \u2020\nTr U4 (t \u2212 1, x) * * *U4\u2020 (0, x) \u03bb b\n16\no\n\nU4 (0, x) * * *U4 (t \u2212 1, x) \u03bb a\n\n\u00d7\nn\nTr U\u03bc2 (t, x) * * *U\u03bc2 (t, x + (r2 \u2212 1)\u03bc\u03022 )\n\nU4\u2020 (t \u2212 1, x + r2 \u03bc\u03022 ) * * *U4\u2020 (0, x + r2 \u03bc\u03022 )\nU\u03bc\u20202 (0, x + (r2 \u2212 1)\u03bc\u03022 ) * * *U\u03bc\u20202 (0, x) \u03bb b\n\nU\u03bc\u20201 (0, x \u2212 \u03bc\u03021 ) * * *U\u03bc\u20201 (0, x \u2212 r1 \u03bc\u03021 )\n\nU4 (0, x \u2212 r1 \u03bc\u03021 ) * * *U4 (t \u2212 1, x \u2212 r1 \u03bc\u03021 )\no\nU\u03bc1 (t, x \u2212 r1 \u03bc\u03021 ) * * *U\u03bc1 (t, x \u2212 \u03bc\u03021 ) \u03bb a .\n2\n\n(1.4)\n\n\fStatic potential for the quark-antiquark-gluon hybrid system in lattice QCD\n\nMarco Cardoso\n\nFigure 1: Wilson loop for the qqg potential, and equivalent position of the static antiquark, gluon, and quark.\n\nFigure 2: Simple Wilson loops that make the qqg Wilson loop.\n\nUsing the relation\n\n\u2211\na\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03bba\n2\n\n\u0013 \u0012\nij\n\n\u03bba\n2\n\n\u0013\n\n=\nkl\n\n1\n1\n\u03b4il \u03b4 jk \u2212 \u03b4i j \u03b4kl .\n2\n6\n\n(1.5)\n\none can prove that\n1\nWO = W1W2 \u2212 W3\n(1.6)\n3\nwhere W1 , W2 and W3 are the simple Wilson loops shown in 2. This operator is gauge invariant,\nit is a function of gauge invariant operators (the mesonic Wilson loops). In particular, for r1 = 0,\nW1 = 1 and W2 = W3 , the operator reduces to the mesonic Wilson loop. In the other hand, when\n\u03bc\u0302 = \u03bd\u0302 and r1 = r2 = r, W2 = W1\u2020 and W3 = 1, so WO reduces to\nWO (r, r,t) = |W (r,t)|2 \u2212 1\n\n(1.7)\n\nthat is the Wilson loop in the adjoint representation [1] used in the computation of the potential\nbetween two static gluons.\n\n2. Details of the Simulation\nOur simulation uses the pure gauge SU (3) Wilson action. For a lattice 243 \u00d7 48 and \u03b2 = 6.2,\n141 configurations were generated, via a combination of Cabbibo-Mariani and overrelaxed updates,\nwith the version 6 of the MILC code [2].\n3\n\n\fStatic potential for the quark-antiquark-gluon hybrid system in lattice QCD\n\nMarco Cardoso\n\nr1 = 6\n20\nr2 = 1\nr2 = 2\nr2 = 3\nr2 = 4\nr2 = 5\nr2 = 6\nr2 = 7\nr2 = 8\nr2 = 9\nr2 =10\nr2=11\nr2=12\n\n- log WO(r1,r2,t)\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\nt\n\nFigure 3: plot of \u2212logWO as a function of r2 and t for r1 = 6.\n\nIn order to increase the ground state overlap and to reduce the statistical error, prior to the\ncalculation of the operator we applied smearing techniques. In each smearing iteration, the link\nwas replaced according to\nU\u03bc (s) \u2192 PSU(3)\n\n\u0001\n1\nU\u03bc (s) + w \u2211 U\u03bd (s)U\u03bc (s + \u03bd\u0302 )U\u03bd\u2020 (s + \u03bc\u0302 ) ;\n1 + 6w\n\u03bc 6=\u03bd\n\n(2.1)\n\nwe used 25 iterations of smearing in the three spatial directions, with w = 0.2, and one iteration\nin the time direction with w = 1.0. Note that while the smearing in the spatial directions only\nchanges the contribution of the various states, the smearing in the time direction also changes\nthe potential, namely it affects the short range part of the potential while leaving the long range\nbehaviour untouched. Nonetheless, the time smearing has the effect of reducing the statistical\nerrors while still getting the right continuous limit (as long as the number of iterations remain\nsmall).\n\n3. The quark-antiquark-gluon Geometries\nIn this work only two geometries for the hybrid system were investigated: the perpendicular\ngeometry, where the position of the quark and the position of the antiquark with respect to the\ngluon form a right angle, and the parallel geometry where this angle is null.\n\n4. Getting the potential\nThe static potential V0 is computed from the large time behaviour of the qqg Wilson loop,\nWO (r1 , r2 ,t) = \u2211 Cn (r1 , r2 )e\u2212Vnt \u2212\u2192 C0 (r1 , r2 )e\u2212V0t\nn\n\nt \u226b 1.\n\n(4.1)\n\nTo measure V0 , \u2212logW (r1 , r2 ,t) is fitted to a single exponential, choosing a fitting range [tmin ,tmax ]\nsuch \u03c7 2 /do f \u223c 1.

The data points used to fit (5.1) are choosen in such a way that both\nr1 and r2 are not larger than a given choosen radius rmax and are not smaller than another choosen\nradius rmin . These radius were choosen to suppress the finite lattice spacing (volume and noise)\neffects in the points with smaller (larger) r1 (r2 ). The results are shown in Fig. 5 and 6. The data is\n\u221a\nconsistent with \u03c3 = \u03c30 , where \u03c30 = 440 MeV is the singlet string tension, and \u03b3 = \u03c0 /12 is the\nL\u00fcscher term.\nFor the parallel geometry, we start discussing the special case r1 = r2 = r, which, as already\nmentioned, corresponds to the adjoint Wilson loop. This system was already studied in [1] where\nthe measured string tension was shown to be consistent with Casimir scaling.\nThe lattice data was fitted to\n\u03b3\nV (r) = c \u2212 + \u03c3 r.\n(5.2)\nr\nFor rmin = 4 and rmax = 12, we obtained\n\n\u03c3\n= 2.21 \u00b1 0.06\n\u03c30\n\n(\u03c7 2 /do f = 0.47),\n\n(5.3)\n\nin agreement with the Casimir scaling hipothesis, i.e. \u03c3 = 94 \u03c30 (see Fig. 8), and with the results of\nprevious investigation [1].\n6\n\n\fStatic potential for the quark-antiquark-gluon hybrid system in lattice QCD\n\nMarco Cardoso\n\nFor the parallel geometry with r1 6= r2 , the potential was fitted to\nVk (r1 , r2 ) = c + \u03c3 rnear \u2212\n\n\u03b3\nrnear\n\n+ \u03c3 \u2032 |r2 \u2212 r1 | \u2212\n\n\u03b3\u2032\n|r2 \u2212 r1 |\n\n(5.4)\n\nwhere rnear = min(r1 , r2 ). This expression assumes that the gluon is linked only to the nearest quark\nby a string, while the quark and the antiquark are linked by a different type of string. The lattice\ndata was chosen as in the perpendicular geometry and requiring also that |r1 \u2212 r2 | \u2264 rmin . The fits\nare reported in Figs. 7 and 8. Note that the string tension associated with the gluon, \u03c3 , agrees with\nCasimir scaling, i.e. \u03c3 /\u03c30 = 9/4, while the quark-antiquark string tension \u03c3 \u2032 agrees with \u03c3 \u2032 = \u03c30\nonly at two standard deviations. In what concerns the Coulombic interaction, \u03b3 is larger than the\nLuscher term but smaller than 9/4 of this value. The quark-antiquark Coulombic coefficient \u03b3 \u2032 is\nconsistent with zero.\n\n6. Results and Conclusions\nIn this work we report on the computation of the static potential for the quark-antiquark-gluon\nsystem. The details of computation can be found in [3]. Two geometries were considered. For\nthe geometries discussed, the lattice data for the static potential is well described by a sum of two\nfunnel potentials. Furthermore, we confirm Casimir scaling for the adjoint representation.\nFor the perpendicular geometry, the lattice data supports a gluon linked with the quark and the\nantiquark by two fundamental strings. For the parallel geometry the string is no longer a fundamental string. Probably, this is due to the repulsion of the strings when they overlap. For the parallel\ngeometry, despite our data being well described by the ansatz discussed previously, one should\ntry other models. Remember that the Coulomb terms are not consistent with Casimir scaling. We\nare currently investigating the possibility of linking both the quark and the antiquark directly to\ngluon and possible contributions from multiple funnel potentials. We also aim to investigate other\ngeometries, namely the antiparallel one where the position of the quark and the antiquark forms a\nstraight angle.\n\nReferences\n[1] G. S. Bali, Phys. Rev.
