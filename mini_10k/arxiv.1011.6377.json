Introduction\nVarious candidates of CDM explaining the observed relic abundance \u03a9h2 \u223c 0.1 has been proposed. Among them, the most promising one is Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) such\nas the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) in the supersymmetric models with R-parity and the\nSM gauge singlet particles in Higgs portal models [1]. WIMPs are produced at the early stage of\nour universe and their current relic abundance is naturally determined when their interactions to the\nSM particles freeze out [2].\nRecently, the Coherent Germanium Neutrino Technology (CoGeNT) experiment reported that\nabout a hundred events [3] exceeding the expected background are observed after their eight week\noperation, which possibly originated from the nuclear recoil by DM scattering. Due to its enhanced\nsensitivity to low energy events, the ionization signal observed in the CoGeNT detector is as low\nas 0.4 \u2212 3.2 keVee. The discovery region, hence, supports the existence of light DM whose mass\nis m\u03c7 . 10 GeV and the spin independent WIMP-nucleon elastic scattering cross section \u03c3SI is\nas high as \u223c 10\u221240 cm2 . The light WIMP with large cross section is also favored in the recent\nDAMA/LIBRA annual modulation signal [4]. Considering the channeling effect [5], the result\nallows sizable parameter space compatible with other null experiments. There have been several\nproposals to explain this, such as light SM gauge singlet fermion [6]. Therefore, it is very interesting to propose a plausible light WIMP scenario1 .\nThere have been researches to reconcile the CoGeNT report on WIMP signals with other null\nexperiments constraining the detection bound and the previous DAMA result [8, 9, 10]. In this\nproceeding, we briefly summarize the analysis of the light neutralino in light Higgs scenario [10].\nWe focus on the realization of light neutralino of mass 4 \u2212 7 GeV, which is not so much constrained\nby recent analysis of XENON100 [11] and XENON10 [12].\n\n2. Light neutralino\nIn order to have a large scattering cross section of the neutralino off the target nuclei in a supersymmetric SM, either large value of tan \u03b2 or a very light CP-even Higgs boson mediator is needed\nin the process of elastic scattering of the neutralino off the target nuclei. Such scenarios cannot be\neasily realized in the context of the MSSM since they are highly constrained by other experiments\nsuch as the LEP, Tevatron, and rare decays. Especially, it is not easy to obtain the \u03c3SI as high as\n\u223c 10\u221240 cm2 with conventional halo parameters. Therefore, the \"Beyond the MSSM\" (BMSSM)\nconsiderations are required here. Without considering additional light degrees of freedom, the light\nHiggs scenario is natural to be analyzed. (Scenarios with light degrees of freedom are explained in\n[13] with the NMSSM context and in [6] with the SM gauge singlet Dirac fermion. The latter can\nbe also obtained by slightly changing the NMSSM potential with singlet quadratic terms.)\n2.1 Light neutralino in the heavy Higgs scenario\nIn the regime of very large tan \u03b2 with mH not much larger than mh , neutralino-nucleon scatter1 It\n\nmust be noted that there is a negative research such that the channeling fraction of recoiling lattice nuclei in NaI\nis quite suppressed to provide its meaningful effect [7].\n\n2\n\n\fLight neutralino dark matter in light Higgs scenario\n\nSeodong Shin\n\ning process is dominated by the heavy CP-even Higgs mediated contribution so that we obtain\n\u0013\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0012\nN13 2 tan \u03b2 2 100 GeV 4\n\u221240\n2\n,\n(2.1)\ncm \u00d7\n\u03c3SI \u2243 0.23 \u00d7 10\n0.4\n50\nmH\nfor m\u03c7 \u223c 7 GeV where the subdominant down quark and one-loop induced bottom quark contributions are also considered. Therefore, we need very large tan \u03b2 > 100 for mH = 100 GeV to explain\nthe CoGeNT result. In the regime of such large tan \u03b2 , however, the branching ratio of Bs \u2192 \u03bc + \u03bc \u2212\nseverely constrains the parameter set. In addition, combining the the upper limit on the neutral\nHiggs bosons \u2192 \u03c4 + \u03c4 \u2212 in the Tevatron and the observations of the rare decays B \u2192 \u03c4\u03bd with the\nratio of B \u2192 D\u03c4\u03bd /B \u2192 Dl \u03bd in the B factories, we obtain the constraints on the elastic scattering\n\u03c3SI . 5 \u00d7 10\u221242 cm2 , which is much lower than 10\u221240 cm2 to explain the CoGeNT result [14, 15].\nIn the heavy H scenario, it is hence very hard to construct viable models which support the light\nWIMP of mass 4 \u2212 7 GeV with the spin independent elastic cross section \u03c3SI \u223c 10\u221240 cm2 . In\norder to reduce low energy constraints, we need to invoke \"wrong-Higgs\" interactions [16].\n2.2 Light neutralino in the light Higgs scenario\nInstead of the heavy CP-even Higgs mediation scenario for very large tan \u03b2 , we consider the\ncase that the light CP-even Higgs mediated contribution dominates the elastic scattering with moderate tan \u03b2 \u2243 3. The light Higgs mediation can be more important than that of heavy Higgs if\nmh \u226a mH . In such a case, light Higgs mass mh is very small to have large cross section for \u03c3SI so\nthat constraints from LEP experiments and rare decays of mesons must be considered.\nIf 10 GeV. mh . 20 GeV, two kinds of Higgs search at the LEP experiments must be under\nconsideration. One is the Higgsstrahlung process, e+ e\u2212 \u2192 Z \u2217 \u2192 hZ, and the other is the associative\nproduction, e+ e\u2212 \u2192 Z \u2217 \u2192 hA. For convenience, we define the following quantities\nRhZ \u2261\n\n\u03c3 (e+ e\u2212 \u2192 Z \u2217 \u2192 Zh)MSSM\n= sin2 (\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2 ),\n\u03c3 (e+ e\u2212 \u2192 Z \u2217 \u2192 Zh)SM\n\n\u03c3 (e+ e\u2212 \u2192 Z \u2217 \u2192 hA)MSSM B(h \u2192 b\u0304b)B(A \u2192 b\u0304b)\n\u03c3 (e+ e\u2212 \u2192 Z \u2217 \u2192 hA)ref\n= cos2 (\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2 )B(h \u2192 b\u0304b)B(A \u2192 b\u0304b),\n\nRhA \u2261\n\n(2.2)\n\n(2.3)\n\nwhere \u03c3 (e+ e\u2212 \u2192 Z \u2217 \u2192 hA)ref is a reference value assuming that Z \u2212 h \u2212 A coupling constant\nis equal to that of the SM Z \u2212 Z \u2212 h coupling, i.e., gZhA = gSM\nZZh . The value of \u03b1 is the Higgs\nmixing angle. In order to satisfy the negative results of scalar searches at the LEP experiments,\nRhZ . 0.01 is required for the Higgsstrahlung process and RhA . 0.2 for the associative production\nwhen mh \u223c 20 GeV, mA \u223c 90 GeV [17].\nIn the case that sin2 (\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2 ) < 0.01, we can evade the constraint from the Higgsstrahlung\nprocess. However, avoiding the associative production constraint is not trivial since cos(\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2 ) \u2243 1.\nThe light neutralino with m\u03c7 . mh /2 can be a solution in this case. Since the light Higgs can decay\nto the neutralinos, the branching ratio of Higgs decay to neutralinos is comparable to or larger\nthan that of Higgs decay to b-quark pair for low tan \u03b2 . 3 [18]. Consequently, we have reliable\nparameter space by constraining mh & 2m\u03c7 when 10 GeV . mh . 20 GeV. It is, however, not the\nend of the story and this region will be discussed again in the next section.\n3\n\n\fLight neutralino dark matter in light Higgs scenario\n\nSeodong Shin\n\nIf mh < 10 GeV, light Higgs cannot decay to b-quark pair but can decay to \u03c4 -leptons. In\nthis case, the constraint from the associative production is practically not relevant because Higgs\nconstraints from 2b2\u03c4 final state is much weaker than those from 4b final state [17]. On the other\nhand, the constraint from radiative \u03a5 decay, \u03a5 \u2192 h\u03b3 is on rise as well as Higgsstrahlung constraint\nsin(\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2 ) \u2248 0. Very light scalar particles can contribute the radiative decay of \u03a5-meson [19].\nTaking the strongest bound, B(\u03a5 \u2192 h\u03b3 ) < 10\u22125 [20, 21], we obtain a conservative bound\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013 \u0015\ntan \u03b2 \u22122\n2\n2\nmh > m\u03a5 0.894 \u2212 0.0150\n.\n(2.4)\n3\nHence, we obtain mh & 8.9 GeV for tan \u03b2 = 3 to evade the radiative \u03a5 decay constraints.\nUnder such considerations, neutralino-nucleon scattering cross section is obtained in the case\nof sin2 (\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2 ) < 0.01, i.e., \u03b1 \u2243 \u03b2 , such that\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013 \u0012\nN13 2 tan \u03b2 2 10 GeV 4\n\u221240\n2\n\u03c3 \u2243 4.7 \u00d7 10 cm \u00d7\n,\n(2.5)\n0.3\n3\nmh\nfor tan \u03b2 \u223c O(1), as we have expected. Such a light Higgs scenario is not obtained in ordinary\nMSSM parameter space. Instead, we consider BMSSM [22, 23, 24] where light Higgs scenarios\ncan be realized [24]. The SU (2) doublet CP-even Higgs mass matrix in the basis of (Hd0 , Hu0 ) is\n!\n\u2212(MZ2 + m2A)s\u03b2 c\u03b2 \u2212 4v2 \u03b51\nMZ2 c\u03b22 + m2A s\u03b22 \u2212 4v2 \u03b51 s2\u03b2 + 4v2 \u03b52 s2\u03b2\n(2.6)\n\u2212(MZ2 + m2A )s\u03b2 c\u03b2 \u2212 4v2 \u03b51\nMZ2 s2\u03b2 + m2A c\u03b22 \u2212 4v2 \u03b51 s2\u03b2 + 4v2 \u03b52 c2\u03b2\nwhere MZ is the mass of Z boson, mA is the mass of the CP-odd Higgs, s\u03b2 (c\u03b2 ) is sin \u03b2 (cos \u03b2 ), and\n\u03b51,2 are BMSSM parameters defined by [22]. Here, \u03b51,2 are assumed to be real for simplicity.\nThe physical CP-even Higgs bosons are obtained as the mass eigenstates of (2.6),\n!\n!\n!\nHd0\nH\ncos \u03b1 sin \u03b1\n(2.7)\n=\nHu0\nh\n\u2212 sin \u03b1 cos \u03b1\nwhere mh < mH and \u2212\u03c0 /2 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 \u03c0 /2 in contrast to the MSSM case. In the MSSM case where\n\u03b51,2 = 0 and tan \u03b2 . 5, mA cannot be larger than MZ since h must be light enough to obtain the large\ndirect detection cross section such as (2.5). If mA \u226a MZ , light Higgs h is mostly down-type and\n\u03b1 \u2243 \u03c0 /2 so that the constraint from the Higgsstrahlung process Z \u2217 \u2192 hZ can be evaded. But the\nassociative production e+ e\u2212 \u2192 hA still constrains such a case. As previously discussed, it seems\npossible to avoid this constraint if Higgs bosons decay to neutralinos, however, there still remain\nother obstacles. If mh + mA < MZ , the invisible decay width of Z-boson must be considered, hence,\nsuch parameter region cannot be viable. On the other hand, if mA . MZ , Higgs mixing is maximized\nso that mh \u226a MZ and mH is larger than LEP search bound 114 GeV. In this case, however, the\nHiggsstrahlung constraint for light Higgs can not be avoided since \u03b1 \u223c \u2212\u03c0 /4. Therefore, it seems\nthat very light CP-even Higgs scenario is not realized in the MSSM context.\nConsidering the BMSSM, instead, the analysis on CP-even Higgs mass is quite different due to\nthe existence of non-zero \u03b51,2 . Observing mass matrix (2.6), the negative \u03b52 correction effectively\nreduces m2A in the MSSM to m2A + 4v2 \u03b52 so that very light h scenario can be realized without\nintroducing light CP-odd Higgs. In addition, negative \u03b51 correction can reduce the off-diagonal\n4\n\n\fLight neutralino dark matter in light Higgs scenario\n\nSeodong Shin\n\n-0.105\n\n-0.075\n\n10\n\n-42\n\n-0.106\n\n10-42\n\n25\n\n-0.076\n\n25\n-0.077\n\n-0.107\n\n20\n\n-0.078\n\n\u03952\n\n\u03952\n\n-0.108\n-0.109\n\n20\n-0.079\n\n15\n-0.080\n\n-0.110\n\n10-41\n\n10-41\n10\n\n-0.111\n\n10-40\n\n-0.112\n\n10\n\n-0.081\n\n5\n\n10-40\n10-39\n\n-0.082\n\n-0.10 -0.09 -0.08 -0.07 -0.06 -0.05\n\n-0.06\n\n\u03951\n\n15\n\n-0.05\n\n-0.04\n\n5\n-0.03\n\n-0.02\n\n\u03951\n\n(a) tan \u03b2 = 3, mA = 90 GeV\n\n(b) tan \u03b2 = 5, mA = 90 GeV\n\nFigure 1: Numerical results of neutralino-nucleon scattering cross section in \u03b51 \u2212 \u03b52 plane.

Therefore, it seems plausible to obtain a light CP-even Higgs\nscenario in the context of BMSSM.2\n\n3. Numerical results in BMSSM parameter space\nIn the BMSSM, the \u03b51 correction is also included in the neutralino sector [22, 25].

Since the BMSSM corrections are much smaller than the MSSM ones, these corrections do not spoil the aforementioned advantages. Numerical results are given in Fig. 1.

We, hence, need lower value of tan \u03b2 since the branching ratio of h to \u03c7 \u03c7\nbecomes larger for smaller tan \u03b2 . Comparing the Fig. 1(a) and Fig. 1(b) , however, larger values\nof |\u03b51,2 | are needed to obtain the light Higgs spectrum for smaller tan \u03b2 . Then, we need much fine\n2 The\n\nissue on the stability of the BMSSM Higgs potential will be discussed in the revised version of [10].\n\n5\n\n\fLight neutralino dark matter in light Higgs scenario\n\nSeodong Shin\n\n1\n10 -1\nm\n\n10 -2\n\nh\n\n= 10 GeV\n\nWh2\n\n9G eV\n\n10 -3\n9.5G eV\n\n10 -4\n10 -5\n10 -6\n4.0\n\n4.5\n\n5.0\n\n5.5\n6.0\nm \u03a7 HGeV L\n\n6.5\n\n7.0\n\nFigure 2: \u03a9h2 to m\u03c7 with fixed tan \u03b2 = 3 and N13 = 0.3 values.

The red region denotes the observed relic abundance.\n\ntuning to obtain such light Higgs so that it is more natural to consider only the case mh < 10 GeV.\nConsequently, the light Higgs scenario to explain the light neutralino of 4 GeV . m\u03c7 . 7 GeV and\n\u03c3SI \u223c 10\u221240 cm2 is most naturally realized when sin2 (\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2 ) < 0.01 and 9 GeV. mh . 10 GeV.\n\n4. Relic Abundance\nSince the neutralino is very light, m\u03c7 . 7 GeV, they annihilate only to light fermions at the\nfreeze-out. In addition, the neutralino is much lighter than the CP-odd Higgs A, squarks, and Zboson so that the dominant annihilation process is mediated by the CP-even Higgs h which is a\nP-wave process. Furthermore, small tan \u03b2 \u223c 3 constrains the interaction of h to the SM fermions.\nTherefore, one might worry that the neutralino will overclose the universe. There is one way out,\nhowever. Since the mass of the light CP-even Higgs is highly constrained, 9 GeV . mh . 10 GeV,\nthe resonant annihilation of the light WIMPs to the SM fermions through the s-channel process can\ndominate the annihilation process and reduce the relic abundance at the freeze-out.\nWe show the role of resonant annihilation to obtain the observed relic density in Fig.2. It is\nclear that the expected relic abundance decreases around the resonance region so that the mass of\nthe light neutralino is determined within 5 GeV. m\u03c7 . 6 GeV. The physically consistent range of\nm\u03c7 is similar for other possible parameter choice since the right relic abundance will be obtained\nwithin the the resonant annihilation process.\n\n5. Conclusions\nThe light WIMPs with large cross section are focussed on due to the recent results of direct\ndetection experiments such as CoGeNT and DAMA. We showed that such a light neutralino can\nbe obtained from the light CP-even Higgs scenario. In the context of the MSSM, however, the\nexistence of such a light Higgs is highly constrained by the LEP experiments. Instead, we looked\nfor a possibility of explaining \u03c3SI \u223c 10\u221240 cm2 , m\u03c7 \u223c 4 to 7 GeV dark matter within the framework\nof the BMSSM (MSSM field contents at and below the weak scale) and found that mh \u223c 9 to 10\n6\n\n\fLight neutralino dark matter in light Higgs scenario\n\nSeodong Shin\n\nGeV can provide the required \u03c3SI . If we require the model to explain the right relic abundance, m\u03c7\nis predicted to be in between 5 to 6 GeV depending on the light CP even Higgs mass 9 to 10 GeV.\n\nReferences\n[1] Y. G. Kim, K.
