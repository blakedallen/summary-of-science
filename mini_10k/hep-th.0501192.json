The basic idea has been to\nprobe a given background geometry through the introduction of a single Dp-brane, whose\ndynamics can be studied using an effective Born Infeld action. Some of this work has\ninvolved probing D-brane backgrounds [7], [20], [5], [6], whilst other work has focused on\nthe NS5-brane backgrounds (see [2], [18], [19], [22], [24], [25])\nThe NS5-brane case is of interest since this particular configuration breaks all the\nsupersymmetry of type II string theory and the BPS probe brane will be unstable. This\ninstability can be interpreted in terms of a rolling tachyon [2], [13], [14], and so study of\nthis system provides useful information about tachyon condensation. In addition, since\nthe NS5-brane is much heavier than the Dp-brane, the source branes will curve the space\naround them creating an infinite throat. As one travels down the throat, one finds that\nthe string coupling increases, thus we find that we are moving from the perturbative to\nthe non-perturbative realm.\nSince we are using perturbative techniques, we expect that our solution will break\ndown as we approach the bottom of the throat. However [2] found that there were certain\nvalues of energy for which the solution held for some time. Another point to consider is\nthe energy emission associated with the Dp brane. As it moves in the throat, the probe\nemits closed strings which carry away energy and the R-R charge. It was found in [9], [23]\nthat the classical analysis is only valid for 5 > p > 2, since the energy loss is not divergent\nin this instance. This will be assumed throughout.\nRecent work [8], [19], has emphasised that probing the compact dimension of the\nR \u00d7 S1 geometry is far better understood in terms of tachyon condensation. However,\nwe expect that the effective DBI action is more useful for probing R3 . It is important\nto understand the motion of branes in time dependent compactified backgrounds, since\nthere may be implications for brane world cosmology. [3], [5], [16].\n3\n\nThe purpose of this work will be to attempt to address some of the questions raised\nin [2] regarding bound orbits and critical angular momenta. We will begin with a review\nof the background solutions and the effective action for a BPS probe Dp-brane. We will\nthen briefly look at the behaviour of the 'tachyon' potential before moving on to discuss\nthe dynamics of the probe brane, both with and without angular momentum, where we\nwill try to explicitly solve the equations of motion. We will also briefly investigate what\nhappens when the compact dimension is not infinitesimally small, and its effect on the\nprobe brane. We conclude with some brief remarks and suggestions for future work.\n\n2\n\n\f2\n\nEffective action and background solution.\n\nWe want to investigate the dynamics of a BPS Dp-brane in the background of k NS5branes which are located at the origin of the transverse space-time S1 \u00d7 R3 . To this end,\nwe must first remind ourselves of the CHS solutions for the metric, dilaton and NS-3\nform, which are given by [1],\nds2 = \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd dx\u03bc dx\u03bd + H(xm )\u03b4mn dxm dxn\ne2(\u03c6\u2212\u03c60 ) = H(xm )\nHmnp = \u2212\u01ebqmnp \u2202q \u03c6\n\n(2.1)\n\nAs usual Hmnp is the field strength for the NS B-field, whilst H(xm ) is the harmonic\nfunction describing the location of the k fivebranes in the transverse space. Generically,\nthe harmonic function can be written as\nH =1+\n\nk\nX\ni=1\n\nwhich, for coincident branes, becomes\n\nls2\n,\n|x \u2212 xi |2\n\n(2.2)\n\nkls2\n(2.3)\nH =1+ 2 ,\nr\n\u221a\nwhere r = xm xm represents the radial distance from the source branes in the transverse\nspace R4 . We wish to consider a new background for the fivebranes, which we can create\nby compactifying one of the transverse directions into a circle of radius Rc (see [4], [15]\nfor example). We are free to arbitrarily choose a direction to compactify since there exists\nan SO(4) symmetry in the transverse space. If we parameterise our chosen direction by\ny then the harmonic function can be written:\nH =1+\n\nkls2\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nn=\u2212\u221e\n\nr2\n\n1\n+ (y \u2212 2\u03c0Rc n)2\n\n(2.4)\n\nIf we now assume that the compactification radius is very small, then we immediately\nsee that this summation changes only very slowly with n and can be approximated by an\nintegral\nZ\ndn\n2\nH = 1 + kls\n.\n(2.5)\n2\nr + (y \u2212 2\u03c0Rc n)2\nPerforming a change of variables ru = 2\u03c0Rc n \u2212 y and integrating over u gives us the\nmodified harmonic function,\nk\u0304\n(2.6)\nH =1+ ,\nr\nwhere for simplicity we have defined k\u0304 = kls2 /2Rc . This has immediate consequences for\nthe validity of the solutions, since we must now ensure that the following constraints are\nsatisfied for the supergravity solution to hold.\nkls2 >> rRc .\n\nr >> Rc\n3\n\n(2.7)\n\n\fIf the radial distance r approaches Rc then this solution will no longer be valid. We can\nstill find an expression in this instance, since although the denominator in the integral will\nno longer be a smoothly changing function, we can still use the summation equation (2.4).\nThis will yield a new harmonic function valid deep in the CHS throat which will match\nonto the 1/r function at some distance. We will refer to this 'deep throat' approximation\nlater in the paper. For now, we will be concerned with the geometry parameterised by\n(2.6).\nInto this background we wish to introduce a BPS Dp-brane, which is extended in\nthe x1 . . . xp directions and parallel to the NS5 branes. As is usual in this situation, we\nlabel the world-volume coordinates by \u03b6 \u03bc and go to static gauge where \u03b6 \u03bc = x\u03bc . The\nembedding of the D-brane in the transverse space gives rise to scalar fields on its worldvolume, labelled by X 6 (\u03b6 \u03bc) . . . X 9 (\u03b6 \u03bc ), and consequently we find that the brane dynamics\nmay be effectively described by the Born-Infeld action:\nZ\nq\n(2.8)\nS = \u2212\u03c4p dp+1\u03b6e\u2212(\u03c6\u2212\u03c60 ) \u2212det(G\u03bc\u03bd + B\u03bc\u03bd + 2\u03c0ls2 F\u03bc\u03bd )\nwhere G\u03bc\u03bd and B\u03bc\u03bd are the pullbacks of the metric and the B-field to the branes world\nvolume, whilst F\u03bc\u03bd is the U(1) gauge field and ls is the string length. In this note we are\ninterested in the case where the only excited field on the brane is r(\u03b6 \u03bc ), and so the Bfield couplings vanish. Furthermore, we will only be interested in homogeneous solutions\nwhere the scalar fields are explicitly time dependent only. In this case the induced metric\nbecomes\n(2.9)\nG\u03bc\u03bd = \u03b7\u03bc\u03bd + \u03b4\u03bc0 \u03b4\u03bd0 \u1e8a m \u1e8a m H(xn ).\nInserting this into (2.8), and also including a non zero, constant electric field on the brane\ngives the resultant D-brane action:\nZ\nq\nS = \u2212\u03c4p dp+1 \u03b6 H \u22121 (1 \u2212 \u03bb\u03b52 ) \u2212 \u1e8a m \u1e8a m\n(2.10)\nwhere \u03bb=2\u03c0ls2 , and \u03b5 is the constant electric field strength on the world-volume. Note\nthat the DBI action can be used here since it accurately describes the classical open\nstring motion. It will not however, account for the radiative corrections due to closed\nstring emission [9].\n\n3\n\nTachyon map.\n\nTachyons in open string models are described by a Born Infeld action, which is given\nby [17]\nZ\np\n(3.1)\nS = \u2212 dp+1\u03b6V (T ) 1 + \u2202\u03bc T \u2202\u03bd T ,\n4\n\n\fwhere V (T ) is the tachyon potential. Upon comparison with (2.10) we find that setting\nthe electric field to zero there is a map from one to the other, provided we define a tachyon\nfield\nr\np\nk\u0304\ndT\n= H(r) = 1 + .\n(3.2)\ndr\nr\nAnd consequently we know that the potential can be written as\n\nWith this definition we find\nT (r) =\n\nV (T ) = p\n\n\u03c4p\nH(r)\n\n.\n\np\np\n1\n1\nr 2 + k\u0304r + k\u0304ln( k\u0304 + r + r 2 + k\u0304r).\n2\n2\n\n(3.3)\n\n(3.4)\n\nIdeally we want to invert this equation to obtain an exact expression for the tachyon\npotential, however this is not always possible and so we must study the effective potential\nbehaviour in its asymptotic limits. To leading order, we find that\nT (r \u2192 Rc ) \u221d\n\nk\u0304\nk\u0304\nln( )\n2\n2\n\nT (r \u2192 \u221e) \u221d r.\n\n(3.5)\n(3.6)\n\nWe find that as r \u2192 Rc , T \u2192 constant dependent upon the number of branes and the\ncompactification radius. In the other limit we see that as r \u2192 \u221e, T \u2192 \u221e as expected.\nUsing this and also (3.3) we find the effective behaviour of the tachyon potential.\nV (T )\nk\u0304\n\u221d 1\u2212\n\u03c4p\n2T\n\nT \u2192 \u221e.\n\n(3.7)\n\nThus as T \u2192 \u221e we see that the potential changes as 1/T \u221d 1/r as expected from\nconsidering the gravitational attraction. This agrees nicely with the solution in the uncompactified case, where it was found that\n\nV (T )\n\u221d\n\u03c4p\n\n(\n\n\u221a\n\nT/\n\ne\n1\u2212\n\nkls2\n\nkls2\n2T 2\n\nT \u2192 \u2212\u221e\nT \u2192\u221e\n\n(3.8)\n\nLooking at the T \u2192 \u221e case, we find that if Rc = T then the solution in (3.7 is\nmapped to the solution in (3.8). This is because letting T be large effectively 'blows up'\nthe compact dimension and we therefore recover our SO(4) symmetry in the transverse\nspace. Thus we should expect to recover the Kutasov result [2]. The behaviour of the\ntachyon field as r \u2192 Rc is logarithmic, which suggests that the potential would have some\n5\n\n\fform of exponential behaviour ( [2], [14]), albeit different from that in the uncompactified\ncase. Geometrically we argue that the tachyon field is related to the radial distance\nbetween the D-brane probe and the fivebranes, and therefore by considering the brane\ndynamics we are learning about the behaviour of the tachyon.\n\n4\n\nProbe brane dynamics.\n\nWe are now in a position to consider the dynamics of the probe brane in this compactified\nbackground. Referring back to (2.10) we note that we can use the SO(3) symmetry\nto rotate the solution to the x8 \u2212 x9 plane by switching to polar coordinates. Namely,\nx8 = Rcos\u03b8 and x9 = Rsin\u03b8. The action now reads;\nZ\nq\np+1\n(4.1)\nS = \u2212\u03c4p d \u03b6 H \u22121 (1 \u2212 \u03bb\u03b52 ) \u2212 \u1e582 \u2212 R2 \u03b8\u03072\nand we can construct the canonical momenta and canonical energy as usual.

Considering only the time dependent case we find the non zero\ncomponents of the tensor are:\nT00 =\n\n\u03c4p\nq\nH H \u22121 (1 \u2212 \u03bb\u03b52 ) \u2212 \u1e582 \u2212 R2 \u03b8\u03072\n\n(4.6)\n\nq\nTij = \u2212\u03c4p \u03b4ij H \u22121 (1 \u2212 \u03bb\u03b52 ) \u2212 \u1e582 \u2212 R2 \u03b8\u03072 .\n\n(4.7)\n\nAs we can see, the time component of the tensor is associated with the energy density on\nthe brane. The spatial component can be rewritten in terms of this density as;\nTij =\n\n\u2212\u03b4ij \u03c4p\n.\nH \u1ebc\n\n(4.8)\n\nFor small R, which we are calling the near horizon geometry, this can be written as\nTij \u221d\n\n\u2212\u03b4ij \u03c4p R\nk\u0304 \u1ebc\n\n(4.9)\n\nwhich tends to zero linearly with distance, in contrast to the original case which vanished\nquadratically. It must be remembered that this is only valid for R >> Rc , and so we\ncannot map this solution to the Kutasov one [2] in this region.\n\n4.1\n\nRadial motion in the near horizon limit.\n\nIn this section we consider purely radial motion of the probe brane, and so we drop the\nangular momentum terms. The constraint equation reduces to:\nk\u0304(1 \u2212 \u03bb\u03b52 )\n1\n\u2212 \u03bb\u03b52 \u2265\n\u22121\n \u0303\nR\nE2\n\n(4.10)\n\nThis tells us that \u03bb\u03b52 must be bounded above by unity, which is automatically satisfied\nsince we have considered the field to be a small perturbation in order to derive the D-brane\naction. The effective potential in this instance reduces to,\nVeff\n\n1\n(1 \u2212 \u03bb\u03b52 )\n=\n\u2212\nH\n\u1ebc 2 H 2\n\n(4.11)\n\nwhich is plotted in fig 1. It shows that the potential is attractive for small energy density,\nbecoming more repulsive as the energy increases. We also see there are minima in the\npotential at large radial distances, which could give rise to bound orbits. The effect of\nthe increasing energy is to move the minimum to larger distances from the fivebranes.\nWe can extract useful information about the behaviour of the probe by considering\nthe limit of small and large R. As R \u2192 0, we neglect the factor of unity in the harmonic\n7\n\n\ffunction since the probe is located inside the throat of the geometry. As the probe\ntravels down the throat, is moves into a region of stronger coupling and so we expect our\nperturbative solutions to break down. But we already know that this is the case, since at\nvery small R the probe will 'feel' the effect of the compactification. The potential in this\nregion can be approximated by\nR(1 \u2212 \u03bb\u03b52 )\nR2\n\u2212\n(4.12)\nk\u0304\n\u1ebc 2 k\u0304 2\nwhich can be seen to tend to zero as the radial distance decreases for arbitrary energy\ndensity. We also note that the potential is identically zero at the radial distance R =\n\u1ebc 2 k\u0304(1 \u2212 \u03bb\u03b52 ). This implies that there is some turning point in the potential for a certain\nrange of values of energy and the electric field. It also implies that due to the supergravity\nconstraints (2.7) we must have \u1ebc 2 (1 \u2212 \u03bb\u03b52 ) << 1.\nVeff \u221d\n\nIn this region, we can solve the equation of motion explicitly. Upon integration we\nfind that\np\n(1 + tan(y)2 \u00b1 tan(y)2 + tan(y)4 ))k\u0304 \u1ebc 2 (1 \u2212 \u03bb\u03b52 )\nR(t) =\n(4.13)\n2(1 + tan(y)2 )\nwhere we have defined y = t/(\u1ebc k\u0304).\nWe note that the solution above with - sign corresponds to an inwardly moving probe\nwith initial (ie maximum ) distance from the NS5-branes, given by R = k\u0304 \u1ebc 2 (1 \u2212 \u03bb\u03b52 )/2.\nTemporarily setting the electric field to zero we see this implies that the smaller we make\nRc then the further away the probe will be. By turning on the electric field we see that\nthis has an affect on the maximum distance. In fact we note that this distance decreases\nas we increase the strength of the electric field. Thus for a fixed value of Rc we see that\nthe increasing field strength puts the probe brane closer to the fivebranes.\nAnother point worth noting is that since tan functions are defined such that the\nargument lies between \u2212\u03c0/2 and \u03c0/2, for a fixed energy density, there are strict constraints\non the time evolution of our solution. This is to be expected since we know that the\nprobe must be deep in the fivebrane throat. What the solution tells us though, is that\nas y \u2192 \u03c0/2, R(t) \u2192 0. This means that the probe will reach the source branes in a\nfinite time as measured from the fivebranes. This is interesting since it contrasts with\nthe uncompactified case, where that particular solution suggested that it would take an\ninfinite amount of time as measured by the fivebrane, but only a finite time when measured\nusing the proper time on the D-brane.\nEven though the minus sign solution corresponds to probe motion toward the fivebranes we know that in the R \u2192 0 limit the theory will break down since the compact\ndimension will in essence 'decompactify'. Furthermore, there will be strong stringy effects\nto take into account, as discussed by [2], [9].\nFor the solution with positive sign in (4.13 ) , corresponding to motion away from\n8\n\n\fthe fivebranes, we see that the probe potentially starts at some minimum distance. With\ntime evolution it moves away to some maximum distance before returning to its original\nposition. However at this point, it would be expected to match onto the in-falling solution.\nThe maximum distance for the outgoing probe is given by\nRmax = k\u0304 \u1ebc 2 (1 \u2212 \u03bb\u03b52 ),\nwhich is also the place where the effective potential vanishes. The difficulty with this\nsolution is that it is unphysical. A probe brane (with electric field) moving into the\nthroat from Minkowski space will either have too much energy and simply head toward\nthe fivebranes, or will oscillate around the minimum of the gravitational potential.\nIn the large R approximation we know that the background spacetime is flat Minkowski,\nand so the effective potential goes as\nVeff \u221d\n\n1\n\u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03bb\u03b52 )\n2\n\u1ebc\n\n(4.14)\n\nwhich is large and positive for \u1ebc << 1, and small and negative for \u1ebc >> 1. Thus we\nsee that the potential is attractive for small energy density and repulsive for large energy\ndensity. Combining this with what we know from the throat approximation, we note that\nfor \u1ebc < 1 the potential will lead to a bound state since it has a crossing point at a non zero\nvalue of R. In terms of the tachyon description we see that the D-brane will be unstable\nand will roll down the potential. For \u1ebc > 1 the potential is repulsive and will not lead\nto the formation of a bound state, which is to be expected since we know that this will\nviolate the supergravity constraints. The effect of an increased electric field strength is\nto shift the potential, reducing the depth of the minimum and bringing it closer to the\nfivebranes. This is shown in figure 2.\nThe explicit solution of the equation of motion in this region is given by\nq\nR(t) = t (1 \u2212 \u03bb\u03b52 ) \u2212 1/\u1ebc 2 ,\n\n(4.15)\n\nwhich shows that the probe brane approaches the throat linearly with time, as measured\nby an observer on the fivebranes.\n\n4.2\n\nCombined radial and angular motion.\n\nWith the inclusion of the angular momentum density, we expect to see slightly altered\ndynamics. We again investigate the potential in the two limits as in the previous section.\nFirstly, for motion in the throat the effective potential is;\n!\nR2\nR(1 \u2212 \u03bb\u03b52 )\nL\u03032\nVeff \u221d\n1+ 2 \u2212\n(4.16)\nR\nk\u0304\n\u1ebc 2 k\u0304 2\n9\n\n\fwhich does not vanish as R \u2192 0, in fact it tends to a constant dependent upon the\nenergy density and the angular momentum density. In all cases we find that the potential\nis repulsive in the throat, independent of the size of the energy density. (4.16) also\nprovides us with another constraint on the allowed values of the energy density and\nangular momentum. It turns out that they must satisfy\n!\n2\nL\u0303\n1\n(4.17)\n1 + 2 >> 1.\n2\n2\nR\n\u1ebc (1 \u2212 \u03bb\u03b5 )\nThe solution to the equation of motion in the throat is given by\nq\n\u1ebc 2 k\u0304(1 \u2212 \u03bb\u03b52 )(1 + tan(y)2 ) \u00b1 \u1ebc 4 k\u0304 2 (1 \u2212 \u03bb\u03b52 )B \u2212 4L\u03032 B\nR(t) =\n.\n2(1 + tan(y)2 )\n\n(4.18)\n\nWhere y is defined as before, and B=tan(y)2 + tan(y)4 . Once again we see that at t=0,\nthe probe is located at k\u0304 \u1ebc 2 (1 \u2212 \u03bb\u03b52 )/2. Choosing the minus sign again corresponds to\ninward motion. We see that the solution describes some kind of oscillatory motion, but\nnow there is the additional angular momentum term to consider.\nThere appears to be a critical value for the angular momentum emerging from this\nsolution, and the vanishing of the potential.\n\u221a\n\u1ebc 2 k\u0304 1 \u2212 \u03bb\u03b52\nL\u0303 \u2264\n.\n2\nIf the angular momentum satisfies this condition, then the solution is valid. However\nin the limit that the LHS is equal to the right hand side, then the square root term in\n(4.18) vanishes. This means that the whole equation for R is independent of time, and\nso the probe brane will be at a constant distance from the fivebranes. Physically we can\nthink of it as rotating rapidly around the throat. The position of the probe in this case is\ndependent upon the size of Rc and the electric field strength. This suggests that if \u1ebc < 1\nthen the angular momentum term is vanishingly small, and can really only be defined for\nthe \u1ebc > 1 case. If the constraint is violated then we pick up an imaginary term in the\nequation of motion. If we look at the vanishing of the potential, we find the solutions are\n\u0013\n\u0012\nq\n\u1ebc\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n(4.19)\nR0 =\n\u1ebc(1 \u2212 \u03bb\u03b5 ) \u00b1 (1 \u2212 \u03bb\u03b5 ) \u1ebc \u2212 4L\u0303 .\n2\nThus when there is no angular momentum we see that the zero of the potential occurs\nat R0 = 0 and/or R0 = \u1ebc 2 (1 \u2212 \u03bb\u03b52) as expected. For non-zero angular momentum we\nagain find our constraint condition. Provided the constraint condition is not broken, we\nsee that there will be zeros of the potential and thus bound orbits will exist.\n\nNow we are in a position to discuss the probe motion in the throat. We have already seen that for L\u0303 = 0, the probe either passes through the fivebranes or is bound to\n10\n\n\fsome maximum distance. This is modified somewhat with the addition of the angular\nmomentum term. We now find that;\nq\n\u1ebc 2 k\u0304(1 \u2212 \u03bb\u03b52 ) \u00b1 \u1ebc 4 k\u0304 2 (1 \u2212 \u03bb\u03b52 ) \u2212 4L\u03032\n(4.20)\nR(t \u2192 \u03c0/2) =\n2\nwhere the angular momentum constraint must be satisfied for the solution to remain real.\nIn this instance, for an outgoing probe, we find the same behaviour as we did for purely\nradial motion. The probe starts off at some minimum distance and moves outward to\na maximum distance which is dependent on the strength of the energy density and the\nelectric field, before returning to the minimum. If we now consider the in-falling brane,\nwe find different behaviour. The probe starts off at some maximum distance and travels\ndown the throat toward the fivebranes. If the energy is sufficiently large the probe will\nreach R = 0. If not, then it will be in a bound state with the fivebranes. The exact\nposition of the bound state in the throat will be dependent upon the strength of the\nelectric field.\nIn the large R limit we see that the effective potential reproduces the purely radial one,\nsince the angular momentum becomes negligible at large distances (in fact the angular\nmomentum is negligible for all distances much larger than the compactification radius as\ncan be seen in figure 3.)\nIn this case the equation of motion can again be solved explicitly with the solution\nq\nt2 \u1ebc 4 (1 \u2212 \u03bb\u03b52 )2 \u2212 2\u1ebc 2 t2 (1 \u2212 \u03bb\u03b52 ) + t2 + \u1ebc 2 L\u03032\nq\nR(t) =\n(4.21)\n2\n2\n(\u1ebc (\u1ebc (1 \u2212 \u03bb\u03b5 ) \u2212 1))\nThe effect of the electric field in this case will be to alter the position of the turning\npoint, moving it toward zero as the field strength increases.\nUsing our canonical momenta we can find the equation of motion for the angle \u03b8 in\nterms of a fixed energy density\nL\u0303\n.\n(4.22)\n\u03b8\u0307 =\n\u1ebcHR2\nFar from the throat, where H \u2192 1, we find that\n\u03b8\u0307 =\n\nL\u0303\n\u1ebcR2\n\n(4.23)\n\nand upon integration we have\n\u03b8=\n\n\u1ebc 2 arctan(Qt/\u1ebc L\u0303) \u2212 2\u1ebc 4 arctan(Qt/\u1ebc L\u0303) + \u1ebc 6 arctan(Qt/\u1ebc L\u0303)\n.\nQ\n11\n\n(4.24)\n\n\fq\n\nWhere we have defined Q = \u1ebc 4 (1 \u2212 \u03bb\u03b52 )2 \u2212 2\u1ebc 2 (1 \u2212 \u03bb\u03b52 ) + 1. This shows that the angle initially changes rapidly but then tends toward a fixed value as time evolves. However\nin the throat we can use our standard approximation of the harmonic function and we\nfind\nL\u0303\n\u03b8\u0307 =\n.\n(4.25)\n\u1ebc k\u0304R\nThis can be integrated, but the resulting expression is extremely complicated. We perform\na Taylor expansion for small t to give us a description of the early time behaviour, which\nshows that to leading order the angle changes logarithmically. This is different to the\nuncompactified case [2], where it was found that the probe spiralled around the throat\ntoward the fivebranes.\nIf these bound orbits can occur, we want to know what their trajectories are. Fortunately we are able to make some headway with this since the orbit of the probe brane in\nthe near horizon geometry is given by:\nZ\ndx\np\n\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c60 =\n(4.26)\n\u2212x2 + B\u0303x + C\nWhere we have defined x = 1/R as is customary, and also\nB\u0303 =\n\nE \u03032 k\u0304(1 \u2212 \u03bb\u03b52 )\nL\u03032\n\nC=\n\n\u22121\n.\nL\u03032\n\n(4.27)\n\nThis allows us to solve the integral, which up to arbitrary constants, becomes\ntan(\u03c6) = p\n\nx \u2212 1/2B\u0303\n\n\u2212x2 + B\u0303x + C\n\n.\n\n(4.28)\n\nUpon expansion this yields a simple quadratic equation and so we obtain the explicit\nsolution for the radius of the orbit,\n\u0011\u22121\n\u0010\np\n2\n.\n(4.29)\nR = 2 B\u0303 \u00b1 sin(\u03c6) B\u0303 + 4C\nThe first thing to note is that there will be an orbit of constant radius, ie circular, if\n\n\u1ebc 2 k\u0304(1 \u2212 \u03bb\u03b52 )\n,\n(4.30)\n2\nwhich is the solution we obtained from the equations of motion. Provided that the angular\nmomentum constraints are fulfilled, we appear to have elliptic orbits parameterised by\ns\n2 2\n2\n4L\u03032\nL\u0303 \u1ebc k\u0304(1 \u2212 \u03bb\u03b5 )\n.\n(4.31)\n, e= 1\u2212\na=\n2\n\u1ebc 4 k\u0304 2 (1 \u2212 \u03bb\u03b52 )2\nL\u0303 =\n\n12\n\n\fwhere, as usual, a is the semi-latus rectum, and e is the eccentricity of the orbit. These\norbits are just the standard conic sections one would expect in this background.\n\n4.3\n\nDeep throat region.\n\nWe will now examine what happens as the probe brane reaches a distance that is comparable with the compactification radius. In this instance we must resort to (2.4)\nH =1+\n\nkls2\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nn=\u2212\u221e\n\nZ2\n\n1\n,\n+ (Y \u2212 2\u03c0Rc n)2\n\nwhere we have chosen to parameterise the coordinates on the S 1 by Y , and the transverse\ncoordinates in R3 by Z for convenience.\nSince this solution will be valid deep in the CHS throat, we choose to rescale the\ndistances by a factor of gs , and then send gs \u2192 0 whilst keeping the rescaled distances\nfixed - which is the limit taken when discussing Little String Theory [10].\nY = gs y;\n\nZ = gs z;\n\nRc = gs rc\n\n(4.32)\n\nThe harmonic function in terms of these rescaled distances is given by\nH(z, y) =\n\nkls2\nsinh(|z|/rC )\n.\n2rc |z| (cosh(|z|/rc ) \u2212 cos(y/rc))\n\n(4.33)\n\nwhere y ranges from 0 . . . \u03c0rc . This parameterisation is chosen to ensure that the fivebranes\nsit at y = 0. At relatively large transverse distance, we can neglect the y term which\nimplies that the harmonic function becomes\nH(z, 0) \u2248\n\nkls2\ntanh(|z|/2rc ),\n2|z|rc\n\n(4.34)\n\nwhilst at very small distances (or equivalently when the z field is minimized) we find\nH(0, y) \u2248\n\nkls2\n4rc2 sin(y/2rc)2\n\n(4.35)\n\nThe behaviour of a probe brane with this harmonic function was examined in [8], where\nthe relationship between BPS and Non-BPS branes was elucidated. The probe brane\nappears to be stable if placed at y = \u03c0rc , but this is in fact a point of instability. As a\nresult, the probe will be attracted toward the fivebranes located at y = 0 or y = 2\u03c0rc .\nThis can be viewed in terms of the rolling tachyon using the tachyon map described in\nan earlier section. Note that if we send y \u2192 0 we recover the usual SO(4) symmetry\nassociated with the uncompactified case.\n13\n\n\fThe action for the probe brane in this background is similar to the one in the earlier\nsections, except that we have a rescaled tension Tp = gs \u03c4p , and we can consider velocity\nin the z and y directions. The rescaled energy in this region is given by\n\u1ebc =\n\n1\np\n,\nH(z, y) H \u22121(z, y)(1 \u2212 \u03bb\u03b52 ) \u2212 (\u017c 2 + \u1e8f 2 )\n\n(4.36)\n\nand the equations of motion for fixed energy are given by\n\u017c 2 + \u1e8f 2 =\n\n(1 \u2212 \u03bb\u03b52 )\n1\n\u2212\n.\n2\n2\nH(z, y)\n\u1ebc H (z, y)\n\n(4.37)\n\nWe know that for distances much larger than rc we can use the results from the previous\nsection, whilst for distances smaller than rc we effectively have a dimensionality crossover\nwhere the harmonic function behaves as 1/r 2. Thus, it is useful to investigate what\nhappens when the probe brane is at a distance comparable with the compactification\nradius.\nFrom the equations of motion, we have the non-negativity constraint\nkls2 (1 \u2212 \u03bb\u03b52 )\n1\nsinh(|z|/rc )\n.\n\u2265\n2|z|rc\n(cosh(|z|/rc ) \u2212 cos(y/rc))\n\u1ebc 2\n\n(4.38)\n\nIf we assume that z \u2248 rc we can perform a Taylor series expansion which yields:\nkls2 (1 \u2212 \u03bb\u03b52 )\n1\n1/2(e \u2212 e\u22121 )\n.\n\u2265\n2z 2\n1/2(e + e\u22121 ) \u2212 cos(y/rc )\n\u1ebc 2\n\n(4.39)\n\nSince the cosine term is constrained to be between \u00b11, we find that the constraint can be\nwritten\nkls2 O(1)\n1\n\u2265\n.\n(4.40)\n2\n2z\n\u1ebc 2\nAs before we write the effective potential as\nVeff\n\n(1 \u2212 \u03bb\u03b52 )\n1\n\u2212\n=\nH(z, y)\n\u1ebc 2 H 2 (z, y)\n\n(4.41)\n\nwhich we plot in figures 5 and 6. As we can see, in the region of validity we find that\nthe potential is repulsive for small values of \u1ebc. The minimum potential in this region is\nat the point y = \u03c0rc , z = 0 as expected from [8]. The effect of the electric field in this\ninstance is to reduce the height of the potential along the S1 direction.\n\n5\n\nDiscussion.\n\nWe have seen that by compactifying one of the transverse dimensions to the NS5-brane,\nwe do in fact find bound orbits at sufficiently large distances. The inclusion of an electric\n14\n\n\ffield on the probe brane also has a strong effect on the dynamics, since we have found that\nan increasing electric field strength tends to localise the probe brane nearer the fivebranes\n- i.e in a region of strong coupling. This is what we would expect, since the field is\neffectively adding more 'mass' to the brane and so we would expect it to sink further into\nthe throat.\nUsing the tachyon map we have explored the differences between the solutions in a\ncompactified background and the general background, and also seen how they can be\nmapped to one another. Interestingly\nwe find that there is a unique size of the compactp\n2\nification radius, namely Rc = kls /2, which will map the compactified solution to the\nuncompactified one as T \u2192 \u2212\u221e. It would be interesting to understand the underlying\nreasons for this.\nWhen we include the angular momentum term we expect to see different dynamics.\nHowever there are constraints emerging from the throat solution which suggest that the\nangular momentum term is negligible in the near horizon region. If the angular momentum\nsaturates the equation of motion constraint, then we will find that the probe executes\ncircular motion in the throat at a distance determined by the compactification radius and\nthe electric field strength. Since the D-brane will constantly be radiating energy as it\nmoves, this trajectory is unlikely to be stable - however since the probe carries RamondRamond charge there may be something akin to synchrotron radiation emission [27].\nThe dynamics of the probe as it approaches the compactification radius have also been\naddressed.\nIn closing it appears that we have verified Kutasov's conjecture and also seen the effect\nthat an electric field has on the probe dynamics. There is still the issue of the critical\nangular momentum to consider, since altering the background geometry appears to have\nno effect on this constraint. Further work must be done to determine the underlying\nreasons for this. The work could also be extended to consider Dp-brane backgrounds and\nalso other types of intersecting brane backgrounds with relative ease. Also the presence\nof a bound state could be useful for cosmology, in particular an extension of the work\nalready done in [3], [16] and [11]. In relation to the work done in [8], it would also be\nof interest to consider Non-BPS branes in this background. Recent work on a related\nproblem has appeared in [18], [20].\nAdded Note: After completing this work we became aware of ref [26] which has a\nsizable overlap with the present paper. However we have in addition, also presented in\nour work, analytic solutions regarding the probe brane orbits.\n\n15\n\n\fReferences\n[1] C. G. Callan J. A. Harvey and A.
