Finally, reduced wind strengths from WR stars at low metallicities impacts upon the immediate circumstellar environment\nof long duration GRB afterglows, particularly since the host galaxies of high-redshift GRBs tend to be metal-poor.\nKey words. stars: Wolf-Rayet \u2013 galaxies: stellar content \u2013 galaxies: individual: I Zw 18\n\n1. Introduction\nWolf-Rayet stars \u2013 subdivided into nitrogen (WN) and carbon\n(WC) sequences \u2013 are the evolved descendants of the O stars,\nand possess strong, broad, emission lines due to their dense,\nstellar winds. WR galaxies represent a subset of emission-line\ngalaxies with active massive star formation via the direct signature of WR stars. To date, over a hundred WR galaxies are\nknown in the nearby universe (Schaerer et al. 1999) via a broad\nC \uf769\uf769\uf769 \u03bb4650/He \uf769\uf769 \u03bb4686 (blue bump) and/or C \uf769\uf776 \u03bb5808 (yellow\nbump) emission features seen in the integrated optical spectrum of individual sources. Indeed, broad He \uf769\uf769 \u03bb1640 emission, attributed to WR stars, can be easily seen in the average\nrest-frame spectrum of z \u223c 3 Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs,\nShapley et al. 2003).\nThe O star content of WR galaxies is typically derived indirectly using nebular hydrogen emission line fluxes to determine\nthe total number of ionizing photons, from which the equivalent\nnumber of O7V stars is commonly calculated. The actual O star\ncontent depends primarily upon the age and mass function, and\nSend\noffprint\nrequests\nto:\nPaul\nCrowther\n(Paul.Crowther@sheffield.ac.uk)\n\u22c6\nBased on observations made with ESO Telescopes at the La Silla\nObservatory under programme ID 074.D-0696(A)\n\nrelates to the equivalent number of O7V stars via a correction\nfactor (Vacca 1994). As such, this quantity is fairly metallicity independent, although O7V stars at lower metallicity will\nlikely have higher temperatures \u2013 and so higher Lyman continuum fluxes \u2013 than their high metallicity counterparts (Massey\net al. 2005; Mokiem et al. 2006).\nIn contrast, the WR content is routinely obtained merely\nby dividing the observed emission bump fluxes, corrected for\nreddening and distance, by average line luminosities of Milky\nWay and Large Magellanic Cloud WR stars (Schaerer & Vacca\n1998). As such, line luminosities of WR stars are assumed to\nbe metallicity independent. Following this technique, the WR\ncontent of metal-rich (e.g. Mrk 309: Schaerer et al. 2000) and\nmetal-poor (e.g. I Zw 18: Izotov et al. 1997) galaxies have been\nderived and compared, generally successfully, with evolutionary synthesis models.\nRecent observational and theoretical evidence suggests WR\nwinds depend upon the heavy metal content of the parent\ngalaxy (Crowther et al. 2002; Gr\u00e4fener & Hamann 2005; Vink\n& de Koter 2005). Since WR stars are believed to be the immediate precursors of some long-soft Gamma Ray Bursts (GRBs)\nthe circumstellar environment of low metallicity GRBs is expected to differ substantially from those in metal-rich regions\n\n\f2\n\nCrowther & Hadfield: Low WR line luminosities at low metallicity\n\n(Eldridge et al. 2005). If WR winds depend upon metallicity,\ndo their line luminosities?\nIn the present study, we present new optical spectrophotometry of single, early-type WN stars in the Large and Small\nMagellanic Clouds in Sect 2. The Magellanic Clouds were selected on the basis of their known distances, resolved stellar\ncontent and low interstellar reddenings. Indeed, reduced He \uf769\uf769\n\u03bb4686 line luminosities for SMC WN stars (log O/H+12 \u223c8.1)\nrelative to the LMC (log O/H+12 \u223c8.4) are obtained in Sect. 3,\nincorporating observations of late-type WN stars from the recent literature. We also demonstrate that carbon sequence WR\nstars at low metallicity \u2013 dominated by the rare WO subclass \u2013\nalso possess lower line luminosities than typical LMC counterparts based upon spectrophotometry of single and binary WC\nstars, published in part by Crowther et al. (2002). In Sect 4, we\nconsider whether reduced WR line luminosities are expected\nat lower metallicities for metallicity dependent WR winds. The\nresults of our study are discussed in Sect. 5, with particular application to I Zw 18, and brief conclusions are drawn in Sect 6.\n\n2. Observations of Magellanic Cloud WN stars\nWe present new spectrophotometry of single LMC and SMC\nearly-type WN stars (Foellmi et al. 2003a, b). Photometric\nproperties of 42 LMC and 7 SMC WN stars are presented in\nTable A1 in the Appendix. LMC WR catalogue numbers include both Breysacher (1981, Br) and Breysacher et al. (1999,\nBAT99), for completeness, whilst SMC WR catalogue numbers follow Massey et al. (2003). The use of single stars at\nknown distances permits a uniform method of deriving interstellar reddenings and line luminosities. In addition, average\n'generic' spectra may be obtained, of potential application in\nsynthesising the bumps in Wolf-Rayet galaxies.\n\n2.1. Observations and data reduction\nWe have observed our LMC and SMC sample using the ESO\nMulti Mode Instrument (EMMI) on the 3.5-m New Technology\nTelescope (NTT), La Silla, Chile. The detector consists of\ntwo 2048\u00d74096 MIT/LL CCDs which were binned by a factor of 2 in both the spatial and dispersion direction. Data was\nacquired using the RILD (Red Imaging and Low Dispersion\nSpectroscopy) mode of EMMI with grism #3 (2.8\u00c5 pixel\u22121 dispersion) resulting in a wavelength coverage of 3800\u20139070\u00c5\nwith a resolution of 9.3\u00c5, as measured from comparison arc\nlines.\nConditions during data acquisition were photometric and\nseeing estimates varied between 0.6 and 1.1\u2032\u2032 . These good conditions together with a wide, 5\u2032\u2032 slit suggests that complete\ntransmission was achieved, and that the data are truly spectrophotometric. On-source exposure times ranged from 60s for\nthe brightest objects (e.g. BAT99-117) to 1260s for the faintest\n(e.g. BAT99-23).\nThe data were reduced following the usual procedure i.e.\nbias subtracted, extracted and flux / wavelength calibrated using packages within \uf769\uf772\uf761\uf766 and \uf773\uf774\uf761\uf772\uf76c\uf769\uf76e\uf76b, except that flat fielding\nwas not carried out due to spurious structure in all calibration\n\nframes. Care was taken during the extraction process to ensure\nthe entire profile was extracted.\nAbsolute flux calibration was achieved by observing the\nspectrophotometric standard stars GD 50, GD 108, G 158-100\nand Feige 110. A comparison between several standards taken\nat regular intervals during each night suggests that flux calibration of the data is accurate to \u00b15%.\nWN spectral types follow Foellmi et al., except for BAT9950 and BAT99-73, which are revised from WN4 to WN5 on the\nbasis that N \uf769\uf776 \u03bb4058 \u226b N \uf776 \u03bb4610/N \uf769\uf769\uf769 \u03bb4640.\nDuring the reduction of SMC\u2013WR11 it became apparent\nthat its spectrum was contaminated by a red line-of-sight companion \u223c1.2 arcsec to the west, which appears slightly brighter\nthan the WR star in R-band acquisition images. We have extracted two apertures for this target: (i) the first provides spectrophotometry for the composite spectrum, but will overestimate the derived reddening because of the red companion; (ii)\nthe second attempts to isolate the WN star, whose colours will\nprovide a more robust reddening. Both entries are given for\nSMC-WR11 in Table A1. The presence of a red companion\nnaturally explains the unusually bright 2MASS JHK photometry for this star relative to other SMC WN stars.\n\n2.2. Synthetic-Filter photometry\nWe have derived synthetic magnitudes for our LMC and SMC\nsample by convolving the calibrated spectra with synthetic\nGaussian filters. The filters have central wavelengths of \u03bbb =\n4270\u00c5, \u03bbv = 5160\u00c5 and \u03bbr = 6000\u00c5 and mimic the response\nof narrow-band b, v and r filters (Smith 1968; Massey 1984),\nwith zero-points adopted that reproduce the synthetic magnitudes for the dataset of Torres-Dodgen & Massey (1988). In\ncontrast with Schmutz & Vacca (1991), the intrinsic colours introduced in Sect. 2.3 include spectral lines, so we consider synthetic rather than monochromatic (line-free) magnitudes. An\naccuracy in the flux calibration of \u00b15% translates to a photometric uncertainty of \u00b10.05 mag. As discussed above, synthetic\nmagnitudes for SMC-WR11 are less reliable than other targets,\ndue to its near neighbour.\nSynthetic magnitudes and colours are presented in Table\nA1, together with differences between this study and that published by Torres-Dodgen & Massey (1988). For the 31 LMC\nstars in common, we find satisfactory agreement between synthetic magnitudes and colours, with average differences of\n\u2206v = vEMMI \u2212 vTM88 = \u22120.13 \u00b1 0.21 mag and \u2206(b \u2212 v) =\n(b \u2212 v)EMMI \u2212 (b \u2212 v)TM88 = \u22120.02 \u00b1 0.06 mag, respectively.\nIn a minority of cases differences were quite significant, with\n\u2206v for BAT99-37 and BAT99-128 differing by \u20130.86 and +0.76\nmag, respectively. For these, Torres-Dodgen & Massey (1988)\nnote that their results are uncertain due to non-photometric conditions. For the SMC sample, Torres-Dodgen & Massey only\nprovide u and b magnitudes. For three WN stars in common,\n\u2206b = bEMMI \u2212 bTM88 = +0.12\u00b10.04 mag.\n\n\fCrowther & Hadfield: Low WR line luminosities at low metallicity\n\n3\n\n0.07 \u00b1 0.08 mag on average.

Excluding SMC-WR11, which is contaminated\nby a red companion, we obtain \u2206E B\u2212V = E B\u2212V (this study) \u2212\nE B\u2212V (MD01) = \u22120.05 \u00b1 0.04 mag.\nWith interstellar reddenings determined, we then fit\nGaussian line profiles to individual He \uf769\uf769 \u03bb4686 emission lines\nusing \uf764\uf769\uf770\uf773\uf76f (Howarth et al. 2003), revealing line fluxes, FWHM\nand equivalent widths, also presented in Table A1. We assume a distance modulus of \u03bcLMC = 18.45\u00b10.06 mag (49 kpc),\nwhich represents the mean of 7 techniques discussed by Gibson\n(2000), and \u2206\u03bc = \u03bcSMC \u2212 \u03bcLMC = 0.51\u00b10.03 mag, based upon\nthree standard candle techniques (Udalski et al. 1999), implying \u03bcSMC = 18.96 \u00b10.07 mag (62 kpc), in reasonable agreement\nwith the recent eclipsing binary determination by Hilditch et al.\n(2005) of \u03bcSMC = 18.91 \u00b10.03 mag. Line luminosities then follow from our derived reddenings and our assumed distances.\n\nFig. 1.

Interstellar reddening\nEstimates of the interstellar reddening towards our sample have\nbeen derived from comparison between the observed colours\nand theoretical non-LTE model predictions, following Schmutz\n& Vacca (1991). Ideally, one would use u\u2212b, but since our data\ndid not extend far enough into the blue, we have instead based\nour reddening estimates on the standard b \u2212 v colour index.\nIt is well known that non-LTE WR models with stronger\nemission lines display flatter optical continuum spectral energy\ndistributions (Schmutz & Vacca 1991). Using the grid of WN\nnon-LTE model spectra generated by Smith et al. (2002) for\nevolutionary synthesis calculations, we have derived the following approximate relationship between (b \u2212 v)0 and the He \uf769\uf769\n\u03bb4686 equivalent width, W\u03bb (in \u00c5)\n(b \u2212 v)0 = \u22120.32 + 0.000476 W\u03bb \u2212 4.2 \u00d7 10\u22127 (W\u03bb )2 mag\nwhich is presented in Fig. 1, together with individual data\npoints from the 40kK \u2264 T \u2217 \u2264 100kK models for Solar, LMC\nand SMC metallicities. E B\u2212V followed from the standard relation E B\u2212V /Eb\u2212v = 1.21 (Lundstr\u00f6m & Stenholm 1984).\nThe scatter in the correlation between (b\u2212v)0 and W\u03bb (4686)\nsuggest that (b \u2212 v)0 is accurate to \u223c 0.04 mag. Combining this\nwith the estimated uncertainty of \u00b10.05 mag in the observed b\nand v colours, we expect that the typical uncertainty in derived\nE B\u2212V values will be \u223c \u00b10.06mag.\nDerived E B\u2212V values for LMC and SMC WNEs are presented in Table A1. We have compared reddening estimates for\nLMC WN stars to those published by Schmutz & Vacca (1991).\nFor the 28 objects in common with both studies we find reasonable agreement, \u2206E B\u2212V = E B\u2212V (this study) \u2212 E B\u2212V (SV91) =\n\nWN2\u20134\nWN5\u20136\nLMC SMC\nLMC\nSMC\nNumber\n36\n5 (8)\n15\n2\nN \uf769\uf776 \u03bb4058\n2\u00b12\n26\u00b124\n10\u00b19\nN \uf776 \u03bb\u03bb4603\u201320 16\u00b120 1.4\u00b10.9\n(2.4\u00b12.1)\nN \uf769\uf769\uf769 \u03bb\u03bb4634\u201341\n25\u00b127\n4\u00b14\nHe \uf769\uf769 \u03bb4686\n84\u00b171 5.8\u00b13.4\n175\u00b1166 43\u00b149\n(17\u00b116)\n\nWN7\u20139\nLMC\n9\n17\u00b19\n\n38\u00b119\n72\u00b167\n\n3. Reduced line luminosities of WR stars at low\nmetallicity\n\n3.1. He \uf769\uf769 \u03bb4686 in WN stars\nIt is well known that SMC WN stars possess relatively weak,\nnarrow emission lines with respect to WN stars in the LMC\nand Milky Way (Conti et al. 1989). We now investigate whether\ntheir line luminosities also differ between these galaxies.\nWe have combined our NTT/EMMI datasets with mid to\nlate-type LMC WN stars from Crowther & Smith (1997) uniformly degraded in spectral resolution to \u223c10\u00c5 to mimic the\nEMMI datasets, supplemented by HST/FOS observations of\nR136a1, a2 and a3 (see Crowther & Dessart 1998).\nResults for individual stars are presented in Fig. 2, where\nwe compare He \uf769\uf769 \u03bb4686 line luminosities with equivalent\nwidths (top) and FWHM (bottom). Fig. 2 supports the conclusions of Conti et al. (1989) that SMC stars have weaker and narrower He \uf769\uf769 emission lines than their LMC counterparts for each\nWN subclass, although we have further restricted our sample\nto apparently single WN stars. This was primarily motivated\nto ensure a uniform method of deriving reddenings and line\n\n\f4\n\nCrowther & Hadfield: Low WR line luminosities at low metallicity\n37.0\nWN3\u22124\nWN5\u22126\nWN7\u22129\nBinaries\n\nLog Luminosity (erg s\u22121)\n\n36.5\n\n36.0\n\n35.5\n\n35.0\n\n34.5\n0.5\n\n1.0\n\n1.5\n\n2.0\n\n2.5\n\n3.0\n\nLog EW (\u00c5)\n\n37.0\n\nLog Luminosity (erg s\u22121)\n\n36.5\n\nWN3\u22124\nWN5\u22126\nWN7\u22129\nBinaries\n\n36.0\n\n35.5\n\n35.0\n\n34.5\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\nFWHM (\u00c5)\n\nFig. 2.

Data for the three SMC WN3\u20134 binaries are\nfrom Torres-Dodgen & Massey (1998), for which an estimate\nof the line dilution has been made on the basis of Mv = \u22124 mag\nfor WR3 and Mv = \u22125 mag for WR6 and WR7 (Foellmi et al\n2003a), although we obtain M=\u20133.9\u00b10.7 mag for our single\nSMC WN3\u20134 stars.\n\nluminosities. Nevertheless, since our SMC sample comprises\nonly seven WN stars in total, we have assessed the impact of\nincluding SMC WN binaries in our study. There are three additional WN3-4+O systems (SMC WR3, WR6, WR7) for which\nwe have used the Torres-Dodgen & Massey (1988) spectrophotometry, plus reddening estimates from Crowther (2000). Their\ninclusion leads to a significant increase in the SMC WN2\u2013\n4 average line luminosity. Nevertheless, it is clear that He \uf769\uf769\n\u03bb4686 line luminosities of SMC stars are typically factors of\n4\u20135 lower than their LMC counterparts for each WN subclass.\n\nAs previously discussed by Schaerer & Vacca (1998) there\nis a substantial scatter in the observed He \uf769\uf769 \u03bb4686 line luminosities of LMC WN stars. FWHM( He \uf769\uf769 \u03bb4686) clusters\naround \u223c28\u00c5 for early WN stars in the SMC, whilst their\nLMC counterparts span a much broader range from 27\u201360\u00c5,\nalthough their mean (32\u00c5) is not so different from those in the\nSMC. Mean line luminosities for early (WN2\u20134), mid (WN5\u2013\n6) and late (WN7\u20139) subtypes for each galaxy are presented in\nTable 1, where quoted uncertainties reflect the standard deviation on individual measurements, with values in parenthesis for\nearly SMC WN stars additionally including binaries.\nOur mean LMC WN2\u20134 He \uf769\uf769 \u03bb4686 line luminosity is\n\u223c60% higher than compiled by Schaerer & Vacca (1998),\nwhich was based on a reduced sample of LMC and Galactic\nstars, using inhomogeneous reddening and distance determinations. Our mean LMC WN5\u20136 and WN7\u20139 He \uf769\uf769 \u03bb4686 line\nluminosities straddle that determined by Schaerer & Vacca\n(1998) for Galactic/LMC WN6\u20139 stars (WN5 stars were excluded from their sample). Chandar et al. (2004) quote similar\nresults using LMC results from Conti & Morris (1990). Vacca\n(1992) determined an average late-type WN line luminosity\nof 1.7\u00d71036 erg/s that is in good agreement with our WN5\u20136\nmean, and represents a good match to that resulting for the 30\nDoradus (LMC: Vacca 1992) and NGC 604 (M33: Terlevich et\nal. 1996) complexes from direct WN star counts.\nWe have explicitly excluded HD 5980 (SMC WR5) from\nFig. 2 and Table 1 since this 19.3 day WN+OB binary underwent an LBV eruption during 1994, with a B1.5Ia+ or WN11\nspectral type during outburst (Barba et al. 1995). Indeed, the\nHe \uf769\uf769 \u03bb4686 line in HD 5980 is highly phase-dependent as a result of strong excess emission arising from its wind-wind collision zone (Moffat et al. 1998).\nNevertheless, for completeness we have estimated its\n\u03bb4686 line luminosity from spectrophotometry of TorresDodgen & Massey (1988) plus our own AAT (RGO spectrograph) and Mt Stromlo 2.3m (DBS spectrograph) observations\nfrom circa 1981-84 to 1997. Adopting an interstellar reddening of E(B-V)=0.07 (Crowther 2000) we have estimated \u03bb4686\nline luminosities of 5.5\u201315\u00d71036 erg/s, unmatched during outburst by any Magellanic Cloud WN star. Koenigsberger et al.\n(2000) present UV spectroscopic observations between 1979\nand 1999, also revealing a factor of \u223c3 increase in He \uf769\uf769 \u03bb1640\nflux over that interval.\nIn addition, since our primary sample is drawn exclusively\nfrom single stars we have constructed 'generic' early, mid and\nlate WN optical spectra for each galaxy. Individual spectra\nwere dereddened allowing for a uniform foreground Galactic\n(Seaton et al. 1979) extinction of E(B-V)=0.05 mag, with the\nremainder according to either LMC (Howarth 1983) or SMC\n(Bouchet et al. 1985) extinction laws. The co-added average\nspectrum was subsequently scaled to the mean He \uf769\uf769 \u03bb4686 line\nluminosity, in each case. These are presented in Fig. 3, and reinforce the reduced line luminosities of SMC stars, relative to\nLMC counterparts for each WN subclass. For the SMC WN3\u2013\n4 subtypes, the dotted spectrum in the region of He \uf769\uf769 \u03bb4686\nadditionally includes the three binaries SMC WR3, WR6 and\nWR7 in which we have attempted to take account of their O\nstar continua by assuming Kurucz (1993) models adjusted such\n\n\fCrowther & Hadfield: Low WR line luminosities at low metallicity\n\n5\n\n37.0\n\nLog Luminosity (erg s\u22121)\n\n36.8\n\nWC4\nWO\n\n36.6\n\n36.4\n\n36.2\nSand 1\n\nSand 2\n\n36.0\n\nDR 1\n\n35.8\n2.0\n\n2.5\nLog EW (\u00c5)\n\n3.0\n\n3.5\n\n37.0\n\nLog Luminosity (erg s\u22121)\n\n36.8\n\nWC4\nWO\n\n36.6\n\n36.4\nSand 1\n36.2\nSand 2\n36.0\nDR 1\n35.8\n50\n\nFig. 3.

He \uf769\uf769 \u03bb1640 in WN stars\nSince He \uf769\uf769 \u03bb1640 from WR stars is seen both in nearby starburst clusters (Chandar et al. 2004) and the average LBG spectrum (Shapley et al. 2003), what is the He \uf769\uf769 \u03bb1640/\u03bb4686 flux\nratio of WN stars? Conti & Morris (1990) compared F(He \uf769\uf769\n\u03bb1640)/F(He \uf769\uf769 \u03bb4686) for a sample of LMC WN stars, revealing \u223c7.6 (see also Chandar et al. 2004). Schaerer & Vacca\nBased upon our spectrophotometry and E(B-V) values, we obtain\nM=\u20133.9\u00b10.7 mag for single SMC WN3\u20134 stars.\n\n70\n\n80\nFWHM (\u00c5)\n\n90\n\n100\n\n110\n\nFig. 4.

(1995) and\nKingsburgh & Barlow (1995), WC4 observations are from Mt\nStromlo 2.3m/DBS (see text). An estimate of line dilution is\nindicated for BAT99-10 (WC4+O) for which Walborn et al.\n(1999) have obtained spatially resolved HST/FOS blue spectroscopy of the WC4 component (their HD 32228-2).\n\n(1998) obtain 7.95\u00b12.47 and 7.55\u00b13.52 for early and late WN\nstars in the Milky Way and LMC.\n29 LMC stars from our sample were observed with\nIUE/SWP using the large aperture (LAP) at low resolution (LORES), from which we have obtained an average\nratio of F(He \uf769\uf769 \u03bb1640)/F(He \uf769\uf769 \u03bb4686) of 9.9\u00b13.22. For 3\nsingle SMC stars with low resolution, large aperture IUE\nSWP spectrophotometry, we obtain a similar average ratio\nof 11.9\u00b11.0. Additionally, we have compared the theoretical\nF(He \uf769\uf769 \u03bb1640)/F(He \uf769\uf769 \u03bb4686) ratio from the non-LTE model\nWN grid of Smith et al.

Unfortunately,\nno single LMC WN7 stars have been observed with IUE/SWP,\nso our late-type WN average is drawn from solely WN8\u20139\nstars. Since only a subset of our LMC WN sample possess ultraviolet spectroscopy, these have been adjusted relative to the\ngeneric optical WN spectra, such that F(He \uf769\uf769 \u03bb1640)/F(He \uf769\uf769\n\u03bb4686) = 10.\n\n3.3. C \uf769\uf776 \u03bb5808 in WC stars\nDo low metallicity WC stars also possess reduced line luminosities? Unfortunately, the only Local Group carbon sequence\nWR stars observed at metallicities below the LMC are the WO\nstars Sand 1 (Sk 188) in the SMC (Kingsburgh et al. 1995)\nand DR1 in IC 1613 (Kingsburgh & Barlow 1995). Smith et\nal. (1990a) established a uniform C \uf769\uf776 \u03bb5808 line luminosity\nfor LMC WC stars, which we now re-evaluate based upon a\nlarger sample, and compared with low metallicity WO stars,\nplus Sand 2 in the LMC (Kingsburgh et al. 1995).\n\n121). Reddenings are either from Crowther et al. (2002), (b \u2212\nv)0 = \u22120.28 mag for cases in which the WC star dominates\nthe optical spectrum i.e. BAT99-121 and BAT99-70 (Brey 62),\nor (b \u2212 v)0 = \u22120.32 mag otherwise. Smith et al. (1990a) assumed (b \u2212 v)0 = \u22120.30 mag for all LMC WC stars, regardless of binarity. For the 7 stars in common, we find \u2206E B\u2212V =\nE B\u2212V (this study)\u2212E B\u2212V (S90) = \u22120.04\u00b10.08 mag. Photometric\nproperties are presented in Table A2 in the Appendix.\nAverage WC (LMC) and WO (LMC, SMC, IC 1613) line\nluminosities for the principal optical features are presented in\nTable 2. Our results support the conclusions of Smith et al.\n(1990a) that the average C \uf769\uf776 \u03bb5808 line luminosity of LMC\nWC stars is 3.2\u00d71036 erg/s, using an increased sample. Despite\nthe small number statistics, C \uf769\uf776 \u03bb5808 line luminosities of WO\nstars are uniformly a factor of \u223c3 times lower than those of\nLMC WC stars.\nFig. 4 compares the C \uf769\uf776 equivalent widths and FWHM versus line luminosity, and includes an estimate of the line dilution\nfor the multiple system BAT99-10 for which spatially resolved\nHST/FOS spectroscopy of the WC4 component has been obtained by Walborn et al. (1999, their HD32228-2). The figure\nfurther illustrates that WO stars in all low metallicity environments possess lower line luminosities than LMC WC stars.\nUltimately, the robustness of these results depends on the universality of the empirical trend from WC to WO at low metallicity (see Sect. 4.2).\n\nTable 2.

Role of metallicity-dependent WR winds\nWe have demonstrated that WR stars at sub-LMC metallicities possess reduced line luminosities, by factors of \u22643 (WC\nsequence) to 4\u20135 (WN sequence), with respect to higher metallicity counterparts of the same spectral subclass.\nUp until recently, the winds of WR stars were assumed\nto be metallicity independent (Langer 1989). Crowther et al.\n(2002) claimed a metallicity dependence of WC winds from an\nanalysis of LMC and Milky Way stars. Recently, Gr\u00e4fener &\nHamann (2005) have argued that line driving of WR winds is\ndominated by Fe-peak elements, whilst Vink & de Koter (2005)\nargue for \u1e40 \u221d Z 0.86 for cool WN stars with 10\u22123 \u2264 Z/Z\u2299 \u2264 1,\nwhere Z is the initial heavy metal content. For cool WC stars\nVink & de Koter (2005) propose \u1e40 \u221d Z 0.66 for 0.1 \u2264 Z/Z\u2299 \u22641,\nand \u1e40 \u221d Z 0.35 for 10\u22123 \u2264 Z/Z\u2299 \u22640.1.\nIn the following, we shall assume that WR winds scale with\nmetallicity as \u1e40WN \u221d Z 0.7 and \u1e40WC \u221d Z 0.5 , in part based on recent empirical results (Crowther 2006), for 10\u22122 \u2264 Z/Z\u2299 \u2264 1.\nWe now investigate how line luminosities and ionizing spectra from WN and WC stars vary with metallicity under such\nassumptions.\n\n4.1. WN stars\nWe have selected HD 96548 (WN8) and HD 50896 (WN4) as\nrepresentative single strong-lined Galactic late and early-type\nWN stars, for which spectroscopic analyses were performed by\nHerald et al. (2001) and Morris et al. (2004) based on the nonLTE, line blanketed model atmosphere code CMFGEN (Hillier\n& Miller 1998), which solves the radiative transfer equation\nin the co-moving frame, subject to the additional constraints\nof radiative and statistical equilibrium. New calculations are\nperformed for the same ions considered by Herald et al. (2001)\nand Morris et al. (2004), with some subtle differences in atomic\ndata.\nWe present the rectified synthetic UV and optical Solarmetallicity models of late- (hereafter WNL-1) and early-type\n(hereafter WNE-1) WN stars in Figs. 6\u20137, together with identical atmospheric models, except that the heavy metal content\nhas been reduced from Z\u2299 to 1/50 Z\u2299 and the mass-loss rate has\nbeen reduced by a factor of 500.7 (hereafter WNL-2 and WNE-\n\n7\n\nTable 3.

Although metal-poor WNE stars may be rich in hydrogen\n(e.g. Foellmi et al. 2003a) the actual hydrogen content does not\nsignificantly affect the ionizing flux or UV/optical spectrum,\nbeyond the strength of the Balmer lines.\nThe low metallicity late-type WN model reveals a weak\nemission line spectrum, with primarily He \uf769\uf769 \u03bb4686 and N \uf769\uf776\n\u03bb4058 seen in the blue visual, such that the Solar-metallicity\nWN8 model has shifted to a weak-lined WN5ha subtype at\nlow metallicity based on the Smith et al. (1996) classification\nscheme. Similarly, the low metallicity early-type WN model\neffectively displays a pure He \uf769\uf769 emission line spectrum in the\nvisual, such that the Solar-metallicity strong-lined WN4 model\nhas shifted to a weak-lined WN2 subtype. In the ultraviolet,\nweak C and N features are seen in both cases. The principal\nphysical parameters of each model are presented in Table 3.\nThe He \uf769\uf769 \u03bb4686 line luminosity of model WNE-2 is\nseverely reduced relative to WNE-1, due to the combination\nof reduced line equivalent width (factor of \u223c4) and reduced\noptical continuum flux (factor of \u223c5). The high wind density\nof the WNE-1 model prevents emission shortward of the He+\n228\u00c5 edge, which is re-radiated at near-UV and optical wavelengths, as previously discussed by Schmutz et al. (1992) and\nSmith et al. (2002). In contrast, the low wind density of the low\nmetallicity model WNE-2 produces a hard extreme UV flux\ndistribution, as indicated in Fig. 8 (see also Table 3). Note that\nthe empirical WN flux ratio F(He \uf769\uf769 \u03bb1640)/F(He \uf769\uf769 \u03bb4686) = 10\n(Sect. 3.2) is also supported at low metallicity.\n\n\f8\n\nCrowther & Hadfield: Low WR line luminosities at low metallicity\n\nFig. 6.

WC stars\nWe have carried out similar calculation for WC stars, based\nupon models for the single WC9 star HD 164270 in the Milky\nWay from Crowther et al. (2006, hereafter WCL-1) and the\nWC4 star HD 37026 (BAT99-52) in the LMC from Crowther\net al. (2002, hereafter WCE-1). Once again, we have obtained\n\nFig. 8. Comparison between predicted emergent spectral energy distributions (erg cm\u22122 s\u22121 at 1 kpc) of late-type (left\npanel) and early-WN (right panel) CMFGEN models, with\nidentical parameters except that heavy metal abundances differ by a factor of 50, and mass-loss rates differ by a factor of\n500.7 \u223c 15, such that the reduced mass-loss models (dotted)\ndisplay harder flux distributions than the high mass-loss cases\n(solid).\n\nCMFGEN model atmospheres for the same ions considered by\nCrowther et al. (2002, 2006) except for some subtle differences\nin atomic data. These calculations were repeated except that the\nheavy elemental abundances (beyond Ne) have been reduced\nfrom 1Z\u2299 (or 1/2 Z\u2299 ) to 1/50 Z\u2299 and reduced the mass-loss rate\nby a factor of 500.5 \u223c 7 or 250.5 \u223c 5, in order to mimic late- and\nearly-type WC stars in I Zw 18 (hereafter WCL-2 and WCE-2).\nThe reduced metallicity synthetic spectra reveal weak-lined\nWC spectral types, since the assumed C and O abundances remain high in the reduced metallicity models: WC7 in the case\nof WCL-2, and WC4 in the case of WCE-2 following the classification schemes of Crowther et al. (1998) or Smith et al.\n(1990b). O \uf769\uf776 \u03bb3411 and O \uf776 \u03bb5592 are strong in WCE-2, with\nO \uf776\uf769 \u03bb3818 weak. Note a modest increase in temperature to\n110kK is sufficient to produce strong O \uf776\uf769 \u03bb3818 emission via\na switch in the oxygen ionization balance, i.e. a WO subtype.\nThe low wind density WC models reveal spectral morphologies quite distinct from the high wind density cases, despite identical (C+O) abundances. Efficient metal wind cooling in the WCL-1 and WCE-1 models (Hillier 1989) produces\nstrong C \uf769\uf769\uf769 lines. For example, C \uf769\uf769\uf769 \u03bb4650 dominates the \u03bb4650\nfeature in the WCE-1 model, with F(C \uf769\uf769\uf769 \u03bb4650) \u2265 F(He \uf769\uf769\n\u03bb4686) \u2265 F(C \uf769\uf776 \u03bb4659). In contrast, cooling is greatly reduced in the low metallicity models, such that negligible C \uf769\uf769\uf769\nemission is now predicted in the WCE-2 model, with F(He \uf769\uf769\n\u03bb4686) \u223c F(C \uf769\uf776 \u03bb4659) contributors to the \u03bb4670 feature.\nConsequently, typical line ratios of individual WC stars at LMC\nor Solar metallicity \u2013 e.g. C \uf769\uf769\uf769 \u03bb4650/C \uf769\uf776 \u03bb5805 \u223c1.6 for WC4\nstars (Smith et al. 1990a) \u2013 do not necessarily hold for WC stars\nin metal-poor environments. Indeed, one anticipates the need\nfor a new system of WR spectral classification at low metallic-\n\n\fCrowther & Hadfield: Low WR line luminosities at low metallicity\n\n9\n\nTable 4.

As\nbefore, the low metallicity, low wind density models predict\nmuch harder ionizing flux distributions than their high metallicity, high wind density counterparts from an observer's perspective as indicated in Fig. 11 (see also Table 4).\n\n5. Discussion\nWe have demonstrated that line luminosities of early\u2013mid WN\nstars in the LMC exceed those in the SMC by \u223c4\u20135. If this is\nsupported for other metal-poor galaxies, one would need to apply such a corrective factor when determining WR populations\nat low metallicity. Unfortunately, within the Local Group only\nNGC 6822 and IC 10 \u2013 with log (O/H)+12 \u223c 8.25 (Pagel et al.\n1980; Garnett 1990) \u2013 possess metallicities below that of the\nLMC. To date, only 4 and 11 WN stars have been confirmed in\nthese respective galaxies (Massey & Johnson 1998; Crowther\net al. 2003) whilst spectrophotometry is not yet available, preventing robust line flux comparisons since reliable reddening\ncorrections rely upon accurate colours of isolated WR stars.\n\nFig. 10. Comparison between early-WC CMFGEN models in\nwhich parameters are fixed, except heavy metal abundances\ndiffer by a factor of 25, and mass-loss rates differ by a factor of 250.5 \u223c 5. The high mass-loss model closely matches the\nobserved spectrum of the LMC WC4 star HD 37026 (Crowther\net al. 2002), whilst the low mass-loss model may be representative of an early-type WC star in I Z 18, with WC4 or WO\nspectral type.\n\nWe propose that a correction factor may need to be applied when estimating WR populations from observations of\nunresolved clusters/galaxies at sub-LMC metallicities, where\nadopted values from metal-rich WR calibrations may greatly\nexceed those of individual stars within those galaxies.

WR population of I Zw 18 from optical studies\nIzotov et al. (1997) and Legrand et al. (1997) presented observations of I Zw 18-NW in which broad blue (C \uf769\uf769\uf769 \u03bb4650/C \uf769\uf776\n\u03bb4658/He \uf769\uf769 \u03bb4686, FWHM\u223c70\u00c5) and yellow (C \uf769\uf776 \u03bb5808,\nFWHM\u223c50\u00c5) emission features were observed, together with\nnebular He \uf769\uf769 \u03bb4686 emission. Izotov et al. derived blue and\nyellow line luminosities of 4.8\u00d71037 erg/s and 2.1\u00d71037 erg/s,\nrespectively, for a revised distance of \u223c14.1 Mpc (Izotov &\nThuan 2004). Applying our own LMC WC calibration or that\nfrom Smith et al. (1990a) to the yellow feature would require\n\u223c7 equivalent WC4 stars (De Mello et al. 1998). In contrast,\nwith a typical low metallicity WC star contributing a factor of\n\u223c5 less C \uf769\uf776 \u03bb5808 flux, we suggest a much larger WC population of \u226530 may be necessary to explain the observed line\nflux in I Zw 18. Depending upon individual temperatures, these\nstars would display either a weak-lined early WC, or a WO\nspectrum.\nLegrand et al. (1997) noted that the observed line width of\nthe C \uf769\uf776 feature more closely matches that of LMC WC4 stars\nthan WO stars (recall Fig. 4). However, WO stars are known\nto display decreasing wind velocities at lower metallicity, as\ndemonstrated in Fig. 12. Consequently, one might expect low\nmetallicity WO stars to have unusually narrow lines with respect to their metal-rich counterparts.\nIzotov et al. noted that the C \uf769\uf769\uf769-\uf769\uf776 \u03bb4650 flux far exceeded\nthat expected from the number of WC stars inferred from C \uf769\uf776\n\u03bb5808, assuming they were typical of LMC WC4 stars, which\nthey exclusively attributed to He \uf769\uf769 \u03bb4686 in late-type WN stars.\n\nIf WC stars in I Zw 18 mimic those of the LMC one would\nexpect C \uf769\uf769\uf769-\uf769\uf776 \u03bb4650/C \uf769\uf776 \u03bb5808 =1.5\u20131.6 (Table 2; Smith et\nal. 1990a) so these would provide \u223c2/3 of the C \uf769\uf769\uf769-\uf769\uf776 \u03bb4650\nflux observed by Izotov et al. (1997). The remainder could be\nattributed to \u223c10 WN5\u20136 stars, or \u223c20 WN7\u20139 (or WN2\u20134)\nLMC-like stars (Table 1; see also De Mello et al. 1998).\nWe have shown that low metallicity WC stars are likely\nto possess rather different ratios of C \uf769\uf769\uf769 \u03bb4650 to C \uf769\uf776 \u03bb5808\nline fluxes from near-Solar counterparts, so we advise caution\nwhen indirectly inferring WR populations at extremely low\nmetallicities in this way. Observationally, it is challenging to\nestablish the presence of WN stars in the Izotov et al. (1997)\ndataset since the \u03bb4650 feature is much broader than in latetype WN stars, with FWHM \u223c70\u00c5. Late-type LMC metallicity\nWN stars possess FWHM\u223c20\u00c5, at comparable spectral resolution (Fig. 2).\nThe difficulty in spectroscopically identifying WN stars in\nI Zw 18 is almost certainly due to the extremely low He \uf769\uf769 \u03bb4686\nline luminosity of individual WN stars, owing to the steeper\nmetallicity dependence of their winds relative to WC stars\n(Vink & de Koter 2005). Since late-type WN stars positively\nshy away from low metallicity environments (recall Fig. 6), line\nluminosities of individual mid-type or early-type WN stars in\nI Zw 18 may be a factor of \u223c10 times smaller than for LMC\nlate-type WN stars according to Schaerer & Vacca (1998).\nIndeed, if we assume \u223c1/3 of the C \uf769\uf769\uf769-\uf769\uf776 \u03bb4650 flux observed\nby Izotov et al. (1997) is due to SMC early-type WN stars,\nwe would require 100\u2013300 WN stars, depending upon whether\nwe adopt average values from Table 1 including or excluding\nthe WN+O binaries. Consequently, large numbers of WN stars\nwould be required for their spectroscopic detection via broad\nHe \uf769\uf769 \u03bb1640 or \u03bb4686 emission. Alternatively, their presence in\nsmaller numbers may be seen indirectly via strong nebular He \uf769\uf769\n\u03bb4686 emission, which is indeed observed in I Zw 18.\n\n5.2. WR population of I Zw 18 from UV studies\nBrown et al. (2002) scanned the NW part of I Zw 18 with\nHST/STIS, revealing two clusters, exhibiting strong C \uf769\uf776 \u03bb1550\nand He \uf769\uf769 \u03bb1640 emission. Adjusting their fluxes to a distance\nof 14.1 Mpc (Izotov & Thuan 2004) indicates He \uf769\uf769 \u03bb1640 luminosities of L1640 = 3.0 \u00d71037 erg/s and 4.0 \u00d71037 erg/s, respectively. Brown et al. applied the Schaerer & Vacca (1998) He \uf769\uf769\n\u03bb1640 calibration of a representative Milky Way WC5 star, implying 6 and 8 WC stars, respectively, with N(WC)/N(O)\u223c0.2\nin the former cluster.\nA similar exercise for the (distance adjusted) C \uf769\uf776 \u03bb1550\nluminosities of L1550 = 6.9 \u00d71037 erg/s and 2.8 \u00d71037 erg/s\nwould lead to 3\u20134 and 1\u20132 stars, respectively, according to\nSect. 3.4 assuming representative LMC-type WC4 stars. The\nreduced numbers with respect to Brown et al. (2002) is due\nto the higher line luminosities of LMC WC4 stars relative to\nMilky Way WC5 stars, plus the low \u03bb1550/\u03bb1640 ratio of \u223c0.7\nfor the second cluster, suggesting a primary contribution by\nWN stars rather than WC stars.\nIf we instead assume a representative C \uf769\uf776 \u03bb1550 line luminosity of 4\u00d71036 erg/s for a single WC star in I Zw 18, i.e.\n\n\fCrowther & Hadfield: Low WR line luminosities at low metallicity\n\n11\n\n5.4. Circumstellar environment of long duration GRBs\n\nFig. 12. Comparison between wind velocities of all known\nLocal Group WO stars, from Kingsburgh et al. (1995),\nKingsburgh & Barlow (1995) and Drew et al. (2004). For Milky\nWay WO stars we have adopted log(O/H)+12=8.6 for WR30a\nwhich lies beyond the Solar circle, 8.7 for Sand 5 which lies at\nthe Solar circle and 8.8 for Sand 4 and WR93b which lie within\nthe Solar circle.\n\nWithin the past decade, several long duration (\u2265 2s) GRBs\nhave been positively identified with Type Ic core-collapse SN\n(Galama et al. 1998; Stanek et al. 2003), supporting the collapsar model of MacFadyen & Woosley (1999) involving WolfRayet stars. The ejecta strongly interacts with the circumstellar\nmaterial, probing the immediate vicinity of the GRB itself, thus\nproviding information on the progenitor (Li & Chevalier 2003,\nvan Marle et al. 2005).\nIf WR stars possess metallicity-dependent winds, one\nwould potentially expect rather different environments for the\nafterglows of long-duration GRBs, that were dependent upon\nthe metallicity of the host galaxy. WN stars in a galaxy of\n1/100Z\u2299 may possess wind densities a factor of \u223c25 times\nlower than those in the Milky Way. In general, the metallicity\ndependence of wind velocities for WR stars is unclear, although\namongst carbon sequence WR star, lower velocity winds are\nseen in WO stars from metal-poor environments (Fig. 12).\nOverall, the immediate environment of GRBs that involve\nWolf-Rayet precursors may differ substantially from those of\nSolar metallicity WR stars (Eldridge et al. 2005). Indeed, the\nhost galaxies of high-redshift GRBs tend to be rather metalpoor, from medium to high resolution spectroscopy obtained\nimmediately after the burst. For example, Vreewwijk et al.\n(2004) suggest 1/20Z\u2299 for the host galaxy of GRB 030323 at\nz=3.37 and Chen et al. (2005) conclude 1/100Z\u2299 for the host\ngalaxy of GRB 050730 at z=3.97.\n\n6. Summary\n5 times lower than typical LMC WC4 stars, we would require\n\u223c17 and \u223c7 weak-lined WC stars for the two clusters. Brown\net al. remarked upon their unusually high N(WR)/N(O) populations, which would be exacerbated if larger WC populations\nare inferred at reduced metallicities.\n\n5.3. Challenges for evolutionary models of single\nmassive stars at low metallicity\nThe potential presence of much greater numbers of WR stars\nin I Zw 18 than is currently appreciated naturally causes problems for evolutionary models of single massive stars at low\nmetallicity. Non-rotating, high mass-loss evolutionary models\nwere calculated by de Mello et al. (1998), revealing progression through to the WN and WC phases for stars of initial mass\n\u223c 90M\u2299 and 120M\u2299 , respectively. For an instantaneous burst\nwith a Salpeter IMF and an upper mass limit of \u223c 150M\u2299 the\nmaximum N(WR)/N(O) ratio is \u223c0.02, with WN stars dominating the WR population, i.e. N(WC)/N(O)\u22640.003. In the case\nof a WR population with \u223c30 WC or WO stars, and potentially \u223c200 WN stars, one would obtain N(WC)/N(O)\u223c0.02\nand N(WN)/N(O)\u223c0.1 in I Zw 18, based upon the \u223c2000 O\nstar content from Izotov et al. (1997, again adjusted to a distance of 14.1 Mpc) greatly exceeding evolutionary predictions\nfor single stars. Further comparison awaits the calculation of\nevolutionary models for single stars at very low metallicity including rotation and contemporary mass-loss rates.\n\nWe have demonstrated empirically that individual WN and WC\nstars at SMC metallicities possess lower optical line luminosities than those in the LMC (or Milky Way), which currently\nrepresent the standard calibrations for WR populations in external galaxies (Schaerer & Vacca 1998). Reduced optical line luminosities at lower metallicities naturally follow if the strength\nof WR winds depends upon metallicity, as recently proposed\n(Crowther et al. 2002; Vink & de Koter 2005), due to the combination of smaller line equivalent widths and lower optical\ncontinuum levels.\nWolf-Rayet stars with weak winds are capable of producing significant He \uf769\uf769 Lyman continuum photons (Schmutz et al.\n1992; Smith et al. 2002), which we attribute to the origin of\nnebular He \uf769\uf769 \u03bb4686 in low metallicity galaxies. Application to\nI Zw 18 suggests that WC stars are present in greater numbers\nthan has been previously suggested, and that WN stars are extremely difficult to detect, since their winds appear to depend\nmore sensitively upon metallicity than WC stars. An increased\nnumber of WR stars at low metallicity causes severe problems\nwith evolutionary predictions for single stars.\nFinally, reduced wind strengths from WR stars at low\nmetallicities impacts upon the immediate circumstellar environment of long-duration GRB afterglows, particularly since\nthe host galaxies of high-redshift GRBs tend to be metal-poor.\nAcknowledgements.
