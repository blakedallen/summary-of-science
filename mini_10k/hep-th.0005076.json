One exciting\nrelated development is Seiberg's N = 1 non-Abelian duality, present in many cases, between a pair\nof theories with different number of color, flavor, and matter contents, which describe the same lowenergy physics [4]-[6]. Another is the discovery of universal classes of conformally invariant theories\n(CFT) for different values of color, flavor, and in some cases, for appropriately tuned values of the\nparameters of the theory [4]-[9].\nStill another concerns the microscopic mechanism of confinement (e.g., monopole condensation)\nand dynamical symmetry breaking, and study of other phases such as the oblique confinement, upon\naddition of a perturbation breaking the N = 2 supersymmetry to N = 1 and/or to N = 0 [1, 2],[10][13]. In fact, an interesting phenomenon has been observed in the case of SU (2) gauge theories with\nvarious flavors and with adjoint mass perturbation [1, 2]: confinement is caused by condensation\nof magnetic monopoles carrying nontrivial flavor quantum numbers. More explicitly, for nf = 2,\nmonopoles in the (2, 1) + (1, 2) (spinor) representation of the flavor [SU (2) \u00d7 SU (2)]/Z2 = SO(4)\ngroup is found to condense upon N = 1 perturbation \u03bc Tr \u03a62 : the flavor symmetry is necessarily\nbroken to U (2). For nf = 3, monopoles in the 4 (spinor) representation of the flavor SO(6) group\ncondense with \u03bc 6= 0 and the flavor symmetry is broken to U (3). In such systems spontaneous global\nsymmetry breaking is caused by the same dyamical mechanism responsible for confinement.\nIn one of the vacua with nf = 3, though, the condensing entity carries magnetic number twice\nthe basic unit but is flavor neutral. In this case - which can be interpreted as oblique confinement \u00e0\nla 't Hooft [14] - confinement is not accompanied by flavor symmetry breaking. For nf = 1, 4, there\nis no dynamical flavor symmetry breaking.\nThese results naturally lead to a conjecture that the condensation of magnetic monopoles with\nnon-trivial flavor transformation property might in a general class of systems explain the confinement\n\u00e0 la 't Hooft, Nambu, Mandelstam [14, 15] and the flavor symmetry breaking, simultaneously 1 .\nHowever, a simple thought reveals a problem with this picture. For instance, the monopoles in\nU Sp(2nc ) theories transform under the spinor representation of SO(2nf ) flavor symmetry, and\ntheir effective low-energy Lagrangian coupled to the magnetic U (1) gauge group would have a large\naccidental SU (2nf \u22121 ) flavor symmetry: their condensation would lead to far too many Nambu\u2013\nGoldstone multiplets. The case of SU (2) gauge theories was special because the flavor symmetries\nof the monopole action precisely coincide with the symmetry of the microscopic theories, somewhat\naccidentally, due to the small number of flavors. It is not at all obvious how such a paradox is\navoided in higher-rank theories.\nArgyres, Plesser and Seiberg [17] studied higher-rank SU (nc ) theories with nf \u2264 2nc \u2212 1 (asymptotically free) in detail. They showed how the non-renormalization theorem of the hyperK\u00e4hler metric on the Higgs branch could be used to show the persistence of unbroken non-abelian gauge group\nat the \"roots\" of the Higgs branches (non-baryonic and baryonic branches) where they intersect the\n1 Such\n\na possibility has been critically discussed recently in QCD [16].\n\n1\n\n\fCoulomb branch. Some isolated points on the non-baryonic roots with SU (r) (r \u2264 [nf /2]) gauge\ngroup as well as the baryonic root (single point) with SU (\u00f1c ) = SU (nf \u2212 nc ) gauge group were\nfound to survive the \u03bc 6= 0 perturbation. Their main focus, however, was an attempt to \"derive\"\nSeiberg's duality between SU (nc ) and SU (\u00f1c ) gauge theories relying on the so-called baryonic root.\nTheir \"derivation,\" however, was incomplete as it did not produce all components of the \"meson\"\nsuperfield. The effective low-energy theory was perturbed by a relevant operator (the mass term for\nthe mesons) and did not flow to the Seiberg's N = 1 magnetic theory correctly. 2 On the other hand,\nthe issue of flavor symmetry breaking was not studied at any depth in [17]. Their analysis also left\na puzzle why there were \"extra\" theories at the non-baryonic roots which seemingly had nothing to\ndo with Seiberg's dual theories. Another paper by Argyres, Plesser and Shapere addressed similar\nquestions, and left puzzles, in SO(nc ) and U Sp(2nc ) theories [18].\nWe investigate here the microscopic mechanism of dynamical symmetry breaking, taking as\ntheoretical laboratory the same class of theories studied by the above mentioned authors [17, 18],\nnamely, theories constructed from exactly solvable N = 2 SU (nc ) and U Sp(2nc ) gauge theories with\nall possible numbers of flavor compatible with asymptotic freedom, by perturbing them with a small\nadjoint mass (reducing supersymmetry to N = 1) and quark masses.

We shall consider, besides the adjoint mass, small generic nonvanishing bare masses\nfor the hypermultiplets (\"quarks\"). The advantage of doing so is that the only vacua retained are\nthose in which the gauge coupling constant grows in the infrared. Another advantage is that all flat\ndirections are eliminated in this way and one is left with a finite number of isolated vacua; keeping\ntrack of this number allows us to do highly nontrivial checks of our analyses at various stages.\nThe most salient features of the result of our analysis will be as follows.

The\nmassless limit, however, is non-trivial and exhibits a much richer range of interesting dynamical\npossibilities.\nIn SU (nc ) theories with nf flavors, the following diversity of dynamical scenarios are realized,\naccording to the number of flavors and to the particular vacua considered. In the first group of\nvacua with finite meson or dual quark vacuum expectation values (VEVS), labelled by an integer\nr, r \u2264 [nf /2], the system is in confinement phase. The nature of the actual carrier of the flavor\nquantum numbers depends on r. In vacua with r = 0, magnetic monopoles are singlets of the global\nU (nf ) group, hence no global symmetry breaking accompanies confinement. This is analogous to\nthe oblique confinement 't Hooft suggested for QCD around \u03b8 = \u03c0.\nIn vacua with r = 1, the light particles are magnetic monopoles in the fundamental representation\nof U (nf ) flavor group, and are charged under one of the color U (1) factors. Their condensation leads\nto the confinement and flavor symmetry breaking, simultaneouly.\nIn vacua labelled by r, 2 \u2264 r < nf /2 but r 6= nf \u2212 nc , the grouping of the associated singularities on the Coulomb branch, with multiplicity, nfCr ,3 at first sight suggests the condensation of\nmonopoles in the rank-r anti-symmetric tensor representation of the global SU (nf ) group. Actually,\nthis does not occur. The true low-energy degrees of freedom of these theories are (magnetic) quarks\nplus a number of singlet monopoles of an effective SU (r) \u00d7 U (1)nc \u2212r gauge theory. Monopoles in\n\n3 In this paper, we use the traditional notation C for the binomial coefficient most of time: another frequently\nn r\n\u0001\n.\nused symbol is n\nr\n\n3\n\n\fhigher representations of SU (nf ) flavor group probably exist semi-classically as seen in a Jackiw\u2013\nRebbi type analysis [19]. Such monopoles can be interpreted as \"baryons\" made of the magnetic\nquarks, which, interactions being infrared-free, however break up into magnetic quarks before they\nbecome massless at singularities on the Coulomb branch. It is the condensation of these magnetic\nquarks that induces confinement and flavor symmetry breaking, U (nf ) \u2192 U (r) \u00d7 U (nf \u2212 r), in these\nvacua. The system thus realizes the exact global symmetry of the theory in a Nambu-Goldstone\nmode, without having unusually many Nambu-Goldstone bosons. It is a novel mechanism for confinement and dynamical symmetry breaking.\nIn the special cases with r = nf /2, still another dynamical scenario takes place. In these cases,\nthe interactions among the monopoles become so strong that the low-energy theory describing them\nis a nontrivial superconformal theory, with conformal invariance explicitly broken by the adjoint or\nquark masses. Although the symmetry breaking pattern is known (U (nf ) \u2192 U (nf /2) \u00d7 U (nf /2)),\nthe low-energy degrees of freedom involve relatively nonlocal fields and their interactions cannot be\ndescribed in terms of a local action.\nFinally, in the group of vacua labelled by r = nf \u2212 nc , the low-energy degrees of freedom are\nagain magnetic quarks and a number of singlet monopoles of an effective infrared-free SU (nf \u2212 nc ) \u00d7\nU (1)2nc \u2212nf gauge theory. There are two physically distinct sub-groups of vacua: one in which the\nmagnetic quarks condense (i.e. confinement phase) with the unbroken symmetry U (nf \u2212 nc ) \u00d7 U (nc )\nis analogous to the ones found for generic r's; the other is vacua in which magnetic-quark do not\ncondense and remain as physically observable particles at long distances (free magnetic phase). The\nglobal U (nf ) symmetry remains unbroken.\nThis last phase is related to the one discovered by Seiberg in N = 1 massless SQCD for the range\nof nf , nc + 1 < nf < 3nc /2. Nevertherless, it should be emphasized that the mi \u2192 0 limit here is a\nsmooth one and the symmetry properties of the vacua are independent of the way the limit is taken,\nwhile in SQCD without the adjoint chiral superfield the vacuum properties depend critically on the\norder in which the mi 's approach zero, showing typically the phenomenon of the run-away vacua.\nAll in all, we find the number\nN1 = (2 nc \u2212 nf ) 2nf \u22121\n\n(1.5)\n\nof N = 1 vacua with finite flavor-carrying VEVS and\nnf \u2212nc \u22121\n\nN2 =\n\nX\nr=0\n\n(nf \u2212 nc \u2212 r) * nfCr ,\n\n(1.6)\n\nof them with vanishing VEVS. The latter is present only for theories with the large number of flavors\nP min {nf ,nc \u22121}\n4\n(nf \u2265 nc + 1). Their sum, N = r=0\nnfCr (nc \u2212 r), correctly generalizes the well-known\nnumber of the vacua in the SU (2) gauge theory, NSU(2) = nf + 2.\nIn U Sp(2nc ) theories, again, we find two groups of vacua, whose properties are shown in Table\n2. The most interesting difference as compared to the SU (nc ) theory is that here the entire first\n4 It may be said that the fact that the generalization is given by these formulas and analogous ones Eq.(1.7),\nEq.(1.8), and not simply, e.g., by nf + nc , reveals the richness of dynamical scenarios of these theories.\n\n4\n\n\f1st Group\n2nd Group\n\nDeg.Freed.\nrel. nonloc.\ndual quarks\n\nEff.

As the superconformal theory is a nontrivial one, one does\nnot have a local effective Lagrangian description for those theories. Nonetheless, the symmetry\nbreaking pattern can be deduced, from the analysis done at large \u03bc: SO(2nf ) symmetry is always\nspontaneously to U (nf ).\nIt is most instructive to consider the equal but nonvanishing quark mass case, first. (See Table\n3.) The flavor symmetry group of the underlying theory is now broken explicitly to U (nf ). The\nn \u22121\nfirst group of vacua split into various branches labelled by r, r = 0, 1, 2, . . . , [ f2 ], each of which\nis described by a local effective gauge theory of Argyres-Plesser-Seiberg [17], with gauge group\nSU (r) \u00d7 U (1)nc \u2212r\u22121 and nf (dual) quarks in the fundamental representation of SU (r). Indeed, the\ngauge invariant composite VEVS characterizing these theories differ by some powers of m, and the\nvalidity of each effective theory is limited by small fluctuations of order of m around each vacuum.\nIn the limit m \u2192 0 these points in the quantum moduli space (QMS) collapse into one single point.\nObviously, a smooth mi \u2192 0 limit is not possible. The location of this singularity can be obtained\nexactly in terms of Chebyshev polynomials. At the singularity there are mutually non-local dyons\nand hence the theory is at a non-trivial infrared fixed point. In the example of U Sp(4) theory with\nnf = 4, we have explicitly verified this by determining the singularities and branch points at finite\nequal mass m and then by studying the limit m \u2192 0.\nThese cases, together with the special r = nf /2 nonbaryonic root for the SU (nc ) theory, constitute another new mechanism for dynamical symmetry breaking: although the global symmetry\nbreaking pattern deduced indirectly looks familiar enough, the low-energy degrees of freedom are\nrelatively nonlocal dual quarks and dyons. It would be interesting to get a better understanding of\nthis phenomenon.\nFor large numbers of flavor, there are also vacua, just as in large nf SU (nc ) theories, with no\nconfinement and no dynamical flavor symmetry breaking. The low-energy particles are solitonlike\n\n5\n\n\fmagnetic quarks which weakly interact with dual (in general) non-abelian gauge fields: the system\nis in the free magnetic phase.\nThe vacuum counting gives, for U Sp(2nc) theories,\nN1 = (2nc + 2 \u2212 nf ) * 2nf \u22121\n\n(1.7)\n\nvacua with finite VEVS (first group of vacua), and\nnf \u2212nc \u22122\n\nN2 =\n\nX\nr=0\n\n(nf \u2212 nc \u2212 1 \u2212 r) * nfCr\n\n(1.8)\n\nof them with vanishing VEVS (second group of vacua); the latter are present only for nf \u2265 nc + 2.\nThe paper will be organized as follows. After discussing briefly the standard expectation on\nchiral symmety breaking in Sec. 2, we start in Sec. 3 a preparatory analysis, finding all isolated\nsemi-classical vacua by minimizing the scalar potential and determining the vevs of the adjoint scalar\nand of the squark fields in each of them. This allows us to count the number of all possible vacua of\nthe theory, after taking appropriate account of Witten's index corresponding to the unbroken gauge\ngroup in each case.\nThe first major step of our analysis is the analytic, first-principle determination of the global\nsymmetry breaking pattern in each vacuum, done by studying the theories at large \u03bc (\u226b \u039b), and\nmi \u2192 0 (Sec. 4). Such a determination is possible because in this case the effective superpotential\ncan be read off from the bare Lagrangian by integrating out the heavy, adjoint fields and by adding\nto it the known exact instanton\u2013induced superpotentials of the corresponding N = 1 theories. By\nminimizing the scalar potential, we reproduce in all cases the correct number of the vacua and explicitly determine the pattern of global symmetry breaking in each them. By N = 1 supersymmetry\nand holomorphic dependence of physics on \u03bc the same symmetry breaking pattern is valid at any\nfinite \u03bc.\nnc\n\n2nc \u2212nf\n\nIn Section 5 another related limit, \u03bc \u2192 \u221e, mi and \u039b1 \u2261 \u03bc 3nc \u2212nf \u039b 3nc \u2212nf fixed, is studied and\nconsistency with the known results in the standard N = 1 theories without adjoint fields is checked.\nThe properties of the quantum vacua at small \u03bc and small mi are studied in detail, in Sections 6 9. In Section 6 we show how all of the N = 1 vacua arise from various classes of conformally invariant\ntheories (CFT) upon perturbation in bare quark masses on Seiberg-Witten curves, reproducing the\ncorrect number of N = 1 vacua found in the earlier analyses. In Section 7 we check and illustrate\nthese results in the cases of rank-two gauge groups, SU (3) and U Sp(4) theories, by directly finding\nthe associated singularities numerically. In Section 8 the effective-Lagrangian description of these\nN = 1 theories is analysed, where we verify that the number of N = 1 vacua and the symmetry\nbreaking pattern in each of them indeed agree with what we found earlier in Sections 3-7. This leads\nus to a better, more microscopic understanding of the phenomena of confinement and dynamical\nglobal symmetry breaking, as summarized above. The actual perturbation theory in bare quark\nmasses on Seiberg-Witten curves, whose outcome is quite central to the whole analysis but whose\nanalysis per se is independent of the rest of the paper, is developed in the last section (Sec. 9).\n6\n\n\fSeveral technical discussions are relegated to Appendices. Appendix A gives a proof of SO(2N )\u2229\nU Sp(2N ) = U (N ); in Appendix B we discuss the Jackiw-Rebbi construction of flavor multiplet structure of semiclassical monopoles for SU (nc ) and U Sp(2nc ) gauge theories; we list explicit expressions\n\u2202ai\nDi\nfor aDi , ai , \u2202a\n\u2202uj , and \u2202uj in Appendix C; the proof of absence of the \"nonbaryonic branch root\"\nwith r = \u00f1c = nf \u2212 nc is given in Appendix D; the study of the monodromy around the seventeen\nsingularities of SU (3), nf = 4 theory is discussed in Appendix E .\nA shorter version of this work has appeared already [20]. The case of SO(nc ) theories, where\nsome new subtleties are present, will be discussed in a separate article.\n\n7\n\n\f2\n\nExpected Pattern of Chiral Symmetry Breaking\n\nIn non-supersymmetric theories with fermions in the fundamental representation of the gauge\ngroup, global symmetry can be broken spontaneously if a fermion bilinear condensate\nh\u03c8\u03c8i \u223c \u039b3\n\n(2.1)\n\nforms. Apart from the requirement of gauge invariance there are no general rules which fermion pairs\ncondense, although in QCD at large nc limit one can argue [21] that SUL (nf ) \u00d7 SUR (nf ) \u00d7 UV (1)\nsymmetry is broken to the diagonal SUV (nf ) \u00d7 UV (1), which is the observed pattern of chiral\nsymmetry breaking in Nature.\nNonetheless certain general considerations can be made. For nonsupersymmetric SU (2) theories,\n2nf fermions transform as the fundamental representation of the global SU (2nf ) group: bilinear\ncondensate (a, b = 1, 2 are color indices; i, j = 1, 2, . . . 2nf are flavor indices), h\u01ebab \u03c8ai \u03c8bj i, is necessarily antisymmetric in (i, j). If these condensates can be put by an SU (2nf ) transformation into\nthe \"standard\" form\nh\u01ebab \u03c8ai \u03c8bj i = const. J ij ,\n(2.2)\nwhere J = i\u03c32 \u2297 Inf \u00d7nf , then such condensates would leave U Sp(2nf ) invariant. Note that this is\nconsistent with what was found in the N = 2 SU (2) QCD, broken to N = 1 by a small adjoint mass\nterm, in case of nf = 2 and in one of the vacua of nf = 3, where the symmetry of the vacuum was\nfound to be U (nf ) [2, 13]. The reason is that in the model of [2, 13] the global symmetry of the\ntheory is reduced to SO(2nf ) due to the Yukawa interaction, and the intersection of U Sp(2nf ) and\nSO(2nf ) is precisely U (nf ) (see Appendix A). For another vacuum of the nf = 3 theory (where\noblique confinement of 't Hooft takes place), the monopole that condenses is a flavor singlet and\nchiral symmetry remains unbroken.\nIn the standard QCD with SU (nc ) gauge symmetry ( nc \u2265 3), 2nf fermions transform as (nf , 1)+\n(1, n\u2217f ) of SUL (nf ) \u00d7 SUR (nf ); condensates of the form\ni\nh\u03c8\u0304R\n\u03c8Lj i = v \u03b4ji ,\n\n(2.3)\n\nis believed to form, at least for small nf , leaving the unbroken diagonal SU (nf ) symmetry. Unfortunately, in the corresponding N = 2 theories (with a small N = 1 perturbation) the axial symmetry\nis explicitly broken at the tree level by the characteristic Yukawa interactions so that the global\nsymmetry contains only the diagonal SU (nf ), already at the tree level. Thus SU (nc ) theories will\nbe considered below mainly as a testing ground of our approach, in correctly identifying the quantum\nvacua which survive N = 1 perturbation, matching the numbers of classical and quantum vacua,\nand in verifying in each such vacua the 't Hooft\u2013Mandelstam mechanism for confinement. In fact\nthis study reveals new, unexpected ways confinement and dynamical symmetry breaking are realized\nin non-Abelian gauge theories.\nThe cases of U Sp(2nc) theories are more promising. As noted above for SU (2) gauge theories,\nin a nonsupersymmetric theories with 2nf fermions in the fundamental representation, the global\n\n8\n\n\fsymmetry is SU (2nf ). Bifermion condensates of the \"standard\" form\nh\u03c8ia \u03c8jb Jab i = v Jij\n\n(2.4)\n\nwould break it to U Sp (2nf ).\nOn the other hand, the corresponding N = 2 models (1.1) have a smaller flavor group, SO(2nf ) \u2282\nSU (2nf ) due to the Yukawa interactions. Nevertheless, there is a nontrivial overlap between its flavor\ngroup SO(2nf ) and the U Sp(2nf ) (expected invariance group for nonsupersymmetric model), which\nis U (nf ). One then expects that the global chiral symmetry SO(2nf ) is broken spontaneously to\nU (nf ) \u2282 SO(2nf ). We shall see below that these expectations are indeed met by quantum vacua of\nthe U Sp(2nc) theories (in the large flavor cases, these take place in the first group of vacua, while\nwe find also a secon group of vacua in which the chiral SO(2nf ) symmetry remains unbroken). The\nproof that SO(2N ) \u2229 U Sp(2N ) = U (N ) is given in Appendix A.\n\n9\n\n\f3\n\nSemi-Classical Vacua\n\nIn this section, we find all semi-classical vacua in N = 2 SU (nc ) and U Sp(2nc ) theories with\nquark hypermultiplets in their fundamental representations, perturbed by the quark masses as well\nas that of the adjoint fields in the N = 2 vector multiplet. The analysis is quantum mechanically\nvalid at large \u03bc and mi . N = 1 supersymmetry and holomorphy in \u03bc and mi forbid any phase\ntransition as one moves to smaller |mi | and |\u03bc| hence the same number of N = 1 vacua must be\npresent in the different regimes to be considered in the subsequent sections. In particular, this\nanalysis allows to determine the symmetry breaking pattern in the equal (and nonvanishing) mass\ncase, in which the classical global symmetry is U (nf ) in both SU (nc ) and U Sp(2nc ) theories.\n\n3.1\n\nSemi-Classical Vacua in SU(nc )\n\nIn the limit mi \u2192 0 and \u03bc \u2192 0, the global symmetry of the model is U (nf ) \u00d7 Z2nc \u2212nf \u00d7 SUR (2).\nThe superpotential of our theory, with N = 2 supersymmetry softly broken to N = 1 by the adjoint\nmass, is given by:\n\u221a\n(3.1)\nW = \u03bcTr \u03a62 + 2 Q\u0303ai \u03a6ba Qib + mi Q\u0303ai Qia ,\nwhere\n\u03a6 \u2261 \u03bbA \u03a6A ,\n\n(A = 1, 2, . . .

This can be done most easily by studying these\nSU (nc ) and U Sp(2nc ) theories at large adjoint mass \u03bc. The advantage of considering the theories\nat large \u03bc is that the adjoint field can be integrated out from the theory: the resulting low-energy\neffective theory is an exactly known N = 1 supersymmetric gauge theory, perturbed by certain\nsuperpotential terms suppressed by 1/\u03bc. The dynamics of such a theory is known, either in terms\nof dynamical superpotential with confined meson or baryon degrees of freedom [23], or in a dual\ndescription using magnetic degrees of freedom [4, 5]. By minimizing the potential of such low-energy\neffective actions we find the symmetry breaking pattern in each N = 1 vacua. Supersymmetry and\nholomorphy imply that there are no phase transition at finite |\u03bc|: the qualitative features found\nhere, such as the unbroken symmetry and the number of the Nambu-Goldstone bosons, are valid\nalso at small nonvanishing \u03bc.\nThis method not only allows us to cross-check the counting of the number of vacua in the previous\nsection, but also enables us to determine the pattern of dynamical symmetry breaking from the first\nprinciples, as the limit of massless quarks can be studied exactly.\nTo be precise, we shall be interested here in the limit mi \u2192 0 with \u03bc and \u039b (\u03bc \u226b \u039b) fixed. As\nlong as \u03bc is kept fixed, the limit mi \u2192 0 is smooth and it is possible to determine how the exact\nflavor symmetry is realized in each vacuum.\nThis is to be contrasted to another limit, \u03bc \u2192 \u221e with mi fixed, which will be discussed in\nthe next section. This latter limit, which does not commute with the former (mi \u2192 0 first), is the\nrelevant one for studying the decoupling the adjoint field and verifying the consistency with the\nknown results in the standard N = 1 theories.\nThe analysis of this section will be divided in two parts, for small and for large values of nf : this\nis necessary due to the emergence of the dual gauge group in the corresponding N = 1 theories for\nrelatively large values of the flavor (nf > nc + 1 in SU (nc ), nf > nc + 2 in U Sp(2nc )).\nFor the ease of reading, a short summary is given at the end of this section: the reader who is\nmore interested in the physics results than the technical aspects of the analysis, might well jump to\nit.\n\n4.1\n\nSU(nc ) theories: Small Numbers (nf \u2264 nc ) of Flavor\n\nLet us first consider the cases, nf < nc .

Furthermore, because the vacua with r\nnonzero entries in the squark vevs leave an SU (\u00f1c \u2212r) dual gauge group unbroken (M being singlet),\neach such vacuum must be counted as \u00f1c \u2212 r vacua (Witten's index).

The number of vacua found here is less than the known\ntotal number of vacua N (Eq.(3.23)). Where are other vacua?\n\n6 Note that the value r = \u00f1 should be excluded. In this case, n \u2212 r = n and the nonvanishing meson submatrix\nc\nc\nf\nis nc \u00d7 nc . Eq.

The theory becomes\npure Yang-Mills type in the infrared, and the strong interaction effects of dual gauge dynaimcs\nmust be properly taken into account. By integrating out the dual quarks out, we find the effective\nsuperpotential,\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1\n1\n(3n \u2212n )/(nc \u2212nf )\n2\n2\nWef f = \u2212\nTrM \u2212 (TrM ) + Tr(M m) + \u039b1 c f\n(det M )1/(nf \u2212nc ) .\n(4.48)\n2\u03bc\nnc\nThe analysis of the vacua of this effective action is similar to that of the nf < nc cases, Eqs.(4.5)\u2013\n(4.15): the superpotential (4.48) is actually identical to (more precisely, continuation of) (4.2)!8 One\nfinds therefore N1 = (2nc \u2212 nf ) * 2nf \u22121 solutions with finite VEVS in exactly the same way as in\nEqs.(4.5)\u2013(4.15). In these vacua, classified by an integer r, U (nf ) symmetry of the theory is broken\nspontaneously to various U (r) \u00d7 U (nf \u2212 r).\nIt is now possible to make a highly nontrivial consistency test, by the vacuum counting. By using\n\u00f1c = nf \u2212 nc and changing the summation index from r to nf \u2212 r, it is easy to show that\nN2\n\n=\n\nnf\nX\nr=0\n\n=\n\nnfCr\n\n(r \u2212 nc ) \u2212\n\nnc\nX\n\nnfCr\n\nr=0\n\n\u2212 (2nc \u2212 nf ) * 2nf \u22121 +\n\nnX\nc \u22121\n\n(r \u2212 nc )\n\nnfCr\n\nr=0\n\n(nc \u2212 r).\n\n(4.49)\n\nThe total number of the N = 1 vacua is therefore found to be\nN1 + N2 =\n\nnX\nc \u22121\nr=0\n\nnfCr\n\n(nc \u2212 r),\n\n(4.50)\n\nwhich is the correct answer (see Eq.

By following the same method as below\nbut with \u03bc = \u221e, we do find the correct number (nc ) of vacua.\n8 In the case of SQCD (\u03bc = \u221e) this observation is in agreement with the well known fact that, in spite of distinct\nphysical features at nf \u2264 nc and nf \u2265 nc + 1, the results for the squark and gaugino condensates, hmi Q\u0303i Qi i = h\u03bb\u03bbi =\n3\u2212n /nc\n\nhold true for all values of the flavor and color as long as nf < 3nc [24].\n(det m)1/nc \u039b1 f\n9 With respect to the \u015c A generators defined in App. A, S A = \u015c A J with S A = S A and TrS A JS B J =\n\u03b1\u03b2\n\u03b2\u03b1\n\n21\n\n1 AB\n\u03b4\n.\n2\n\n\fwhere M ij = Qia J ab Qjb 's are the meson\u2013like composite superfields, m = \u2212i\u03c32 \u2297 diag (m1 , . . . , mnf )\n2(3n +3\u2212nf )\nis the mass matrix, and \u039b1 c\n= \u03bc2nc +2 \u039b2(2nc +2\u2212nf ) .\nWith the ansatz M = i\u03c32 \u2297 diag(\u03bb1 , \u03bb2 , . . . , \u03bbnf ), then the superpotential is (\u039b1 = 1 below):\nnf\n\nnf\n\n1\n1 X 2 X\nmi \u03bbi + (nc + 1 \u2212 nf ) Qnf\n\u03bbi \u2212\nW =\n,\n1/(n\nc +1\u2212nf )\n4\u03bc i=1\n( i=1 \u03bbi )\ni=1\n\n(4.53)\n\nand the vacuum equations become:\n\n1\n1\n1\nQ\n= 0.\n\u03bbi \u2212 mi \u2212\n1/(n\nc +1\u2212nf )\n2\u03bc\n\u03bbi ( j \u03bbj )\n\nSince the last term is common to all i, we find\nq\n\u03bbi = \u03bc(mi \u00b1 m2i + (2X/\u03bc)),\n\n(4.54)\n\n1\nX\u2261 Q\n1/(n\nc +1\u2212nf )\n( j \u03bbj )\n\n(4.55)\n\nWe choose r negative signs and nf \u2212 r positive signs in the roots of \u03bbi .

This restricts the choices of the signs\nby half: for a particular phase of X0 with k even or odd, the number of minus signs among \u03bbi must\nbe even or odd, respectively. In total, there are\n\n10\n\n(2 nc + 2 \u2212 nf ) 2nf \u22121\n\n(4.61)\n\nEq. (4.55) and analogous relations in SU (nc ) case clearly show the non commutativity of the two limits, \u03bc \u2192 \u221e\nfirst with \u039b1 , mi fixed to be studied in the next section, and mi \u2192 0 first with \u03bc \u226b \u039b fixed, being examined here.\n\n22\n\n\fvacua, which is consistent with the previous method as well as the semi-classical method in the\nprevious section (Eq. (3.44)).\nSince the massless limit gives SO(2nf ) flavor symmetry, the choice of different signs in \u03bbi for each\nflavor strongly suggests the vacua to form a spinor representation of SO(2nf ). The constraint that\nthe number of minus signs to be even or odd implies that it is a spinor representation of a definite\nchirality. In fact, all of these vacua transform among each other under SO(2nf ) group because it can\nflip the signs of two eigenvalues at the same time, consistent with an irreducible representation of\nSO(2nf ). The equal mass case mi = m has U (nf ) flavor symmetry and the vacua above form nf Cr\nmultiplets (with even or odd r), consistent with the decomposition of the SO(2nf ) spinor to even\nor odd-rank r anti-symmetric tensors under U (nf ). In each group of vacua, the global symmetry is\nbroken to U (r) \u00d7 U (nf \u2212 r).\nOne of the most important results of this section is that the meson condensates in the massless\nlimit always break SO(2nf ) flavor symmetry as\nSO(2nf ) \u2192 U (nf ),\n\n(4.62)\n\nmatching nicely with the expectation discussed in Section 2.\nWhen nf = nc + 1, the large \u03bc theory develops a quantum modified constraint\nW =\u2212\n\n1\n1\n2n\nTrM 2 \u2212 Tr mM + X(PfM \u2212 \u039b1 f ) .\n8\u03bc\n2\n\n(4.63)\n\nFollowing the similar analysis as above, we again find the total number of vacua to be (2 nc + 2 \u2212\nnf ) 2nf \u22121 , consistent with the semi-classical method.\nWhen nf = nc + 2, the large \u03bc theory develops a superpotential\nW =\u2212\n\n1\n1\nPfM\nTrM 2 \u2212 Tr mM + 2nf \u22123 .\n8\u03bc\n2\n\u039b1\n\n(4.64)\n\nFollowing the similar analysis as above, we again find the total number of vacua to be nc 2nf \u22121 +\n1, consistent with the semi-classical method. The last vacuum corresponds to the case without\nsymmetry breaking \u03bbi = 2mi \u03bc \u2192 0 in the massless quark limit.\n\n4.5\n\nUSp(2nc ) Theories: Large Numbers (nf > nc + 2) of Flavor\n\nNext consider the cases nf > nc + 2. The large \u03bc theory has a description in terms of the dual\nmagnetic gauge group U Sp(2\u00f1c ) = U Sp(2(nf \u2212 nc \u2212 2)) and magnetic quarks q,\nW =\u2212\n\n1\n1\n1\nqM q ,\nTrM 2 \u2212 Tr mM +\n8\u03bc\n2\n\u03bcm\n\n(4.65)\n\nwhere the scale \u03bcm is the matching scale between the electric and magnetic gauge couplings. As in\nthe SU (nc ) cases above, it is only consistent to use this effective action to get information on the\nvacuum properties as long as dual quarks turn out to be light. Otherwise, the nontrivial dual gauge\ndynamics must be taken into acoount.\n23\n\n\fBy minimizing the potential of the magnetic theory with dual quarks directly, we find vacua\ncharacterized by VEVS\n\u221a\n\u03bbi = 0,\n(4.66)\nqi = \u03bcmi ,\nfor r flavors and\nqi = 0,\n\n\u03bbi = mi \u03bc,\n\n(4.67)\n\nfor the remaining nf \u2212r flavors. r is restricted to be r \u2264 \u00f1c = nf \u2212nc \u22122. For each value of r, there are\nnf Cr choices on which flavor to have non-vanishing qi , and there is unbroken U Sp(2(nf \u2212 nc \u2212 2 \u2212 r))\ngauge group. It develops the gaugino condensate, giving nf \u2212 nc \u2212 1 \u2212 r vacua each. The number\nof vacua of this type is\nnf \u2212nc \u22122\nX\n(4.68)\nN2 =\nnfCr (nf \u2212 nc \u2212 1 \u2212 r).\nr=0\n\nChanging the variable r to nf \u2212 r, it is rewritten as\nN2 =\n\nnf\nX\n\nnfCr\n\nr=nc +2\n\n(r \u2212 nc \u2212 1) =\n\nnf\nX\nr=0\n\nnfCr\n\n(r \u2212 nc \u2212 1) +\n\nnX\nc +1\n\nnfCr\n\nr=0\n\n(nc + 1 \u2212 r).\n\n(4.69)\n\nThe first sum can be computed and gives\nN2 = \u2212(2nc + 2 \u2212 nf ) 2nf \u22121 +\n\nnc\nX\nr=0\n\nnfCr\n\n(nc + 1 \u2212 r).\n\n(4.70)\n\nNote that the sum in the second term can be stopped at r = nc because the argument vanishes for\nr = nc + 1. Therefore the total N = N1 + N2 agrees with the counting of classical vacua. On the\nother hand, this gives a nice interpretation of the number that the \"extra\" contribution N2 signals\nthe emergence of the dual gauge group in the massless quark limit. In this group of vacua (present\nonly for larger values of nf ), the chiral symmetry is not spontaneously broken in the limit, mi \u2192 0.\nIn order to get the vacua with RankM = nf , one must integrate out the dual quarks first and\nconsider the resulting effective action:\nWeff\n\n\u0014\n\u00151/(nf \u2212nc \u22121)\n1\n1\nM 3(nf \u2212nc \u22121)\u2212nf\n2\n= \u2212 TrM \u2212 Tr mM + (nc + 1 \u2212 nf ) Pf\n\u039b\u0303\n.\n8\u03bc\n2\n\u03bcm\n\n(4.71)\n\nBy making the ansatz, M = i\u03c32 \u2297 diag(\u03bb1 , \u03bb2 , . . . , \u03bbnf ), the vacuum equation becomes\nnf\nY\n\u03bbi\n\u03bcm\ni\n\n!1/(nf \u2212nc \u22121)\n\n\u039b\u0303(3(nf \u2212nc \u22121)\u2212nf )/(nf \u2212nc \u22121) = mi \u03bbi \u2212\n\n\u03bb2i\n.\n\u03bc\n\n(4.72)\n\nCall the right hand side, which is flavor indepedent, X.

In this set of vacua X depends on \u039b\u0303 and has a finite mi \u2192 0 limit (i.e., \u03bbi stay nonvanishing, justifying the assumption of the maximal rank meson matrix). Since all \u03bbi 's are equal in\nthe magnitude in this limit, the chiral SO(2nf ) symmetry is spontaneously broken as\nSO(2nf ) \u2192 U (nf )\n\n(4.77)\n\nin all vacua belonging to this group. Note that this number of vacua would precisely corresponds\nto that of monopole condensation in the SO(2nf ) spinor representation at the Chebyshev points of\nthe curve (see below).\nP c\nThe total number of vacua at large \u03bc found, N1 + N2 = nr=0\nnfCr (nc + 1 \u2212 r), agrees with that\nof the semiclassical theories.\n\n4.6\n\nSummary of Section 4\n\nThe number of N = 1 vacua and the pattern of symmetry breaking in each of them has thus been\ndetermined in SU (nc ) and U Sp(2nc ) theories at large \u03bc, from the first principles. For small numbers\nof flavor (nf \u2264 nc + 1 for SU (nc ); nf \u2264 nc + 2 for U Sp(2nc )) the low\u2013energy degrees of freedom are\nmeson\u2013like (sometimes also baryon\u2013like) composites: their condensation lead to a definite pattern\nof symmetry breaking in each vacuum.\nSU (nc ) theories have an exact global U (nf ) symmetry in the equal mass (or massless) limit,\nwhich is spontaneously broken to U (r) \u00d7 U (nf \u2212 r) in (nc \u2212 r) nfCr vacua, r = 0, 1, . . . , [nf /2].\nThe number of the vacua with the particular pattern of symmetry breaking will match exactly with\nthose found from the analysis of low-energy monopole/dual quark effective action, to be analyzed in\nthe next sections.\nIn U Sp(2nc) theories, for small numbers of flavor, the chiral symmetry (SO(2nf )) in the massless\nlimit is always spontaneouly broken down to an unbroken U (nf ). This result nicely agrees with\nwhat is expected generally from bifermion condensates of the standard form in non supersymmetric\ntheories. This fact that various vacua have exactly the same symmetry breaking pattern, has an\nimportant consequence in the physics at small \u03bc, to be studied below.\nThe difference in the symmetry breaking pattern in SU (nc ) and U Sp(2nc ) theories reflects the\nstructures of the low-energy effective actions of the respective theories, which in turn is a direct\nconsequence of the different structure of the two types of gauge groups, see Eq.(4.2) and Eq.(4.52).\nFor larger numbers of flavor (nf > nc + 1 for SU (nc ); nf > nc + 2 for U Sp(2nc )) the low-energy\ndegrees of freedom are dual quarks and gluons, as well as some mesons. In these cases, besides\n25\n\n\fthe vacua with the properties mentioned above, other vacua exist in which all VEVS vanish and in\nwhich the global symmetry (SU (nf ) for SU (nc ); SO(2nf ) in U Sp(2nc ) theories) remains unbroken\nin the massless limit (mi \u2192 0, \u2200i).\n\n26\n\n\f5\n\nDecoupling of the Adjoint Fields\nIn this section we discuss briefly another limit, in which \u03bc is sent to \u221e, keeping mi and \u039b1 \u2261\n\nnc\n3nc \u2212nf\n\n2nc \u2212nf\n\n\u03bc\n\u039b 3nc \u2212nf fixed. We first re-analyse the number of the N = 1 vacua in the regime, \u03bc \u226b \u039b1 , mi ,\nand reproduce the correct multiplicity of vacua. Since the two limits (\u03bc \u2192 \u221e first and mi \u2192 0 first)\ndo not commute, this provides for an independent check of the vacuum counting. Subsequently,\ntaking the decoupling limit, \u03bc \u2192 \u221e, we identify the standard supersymmetric vacua of the theories\nwithout the adjoint field \u03a6 .\n\n5.1\n\nSU(nc )\n\nFirst consider the cases with small number of flavors, nf \u2264 nc , and go back to the equations for \u03bbi\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n(3n \u2212n )/(nc \u2212nf )\n1\n\u039b1 c f\n1 X \uf8f8\n1\uf8ed\nQ\n\u03bb\u22121 = 0 .\n(5.1)\n\u03bbj + mi \u2212\n\u03bbi \u2212\n\u2212\n\u03bc\nnc j\nnc \u2212 nf ( j \u03bbj )1/(nc \u2212nf ) i\n\nfollowing from\n\nW =\u2212\n\n\u0014\n\u0015\n(3n \u2212n )/(nc \u2212nf )\n1\n1\n\u039b c f\n,\nTrM 2 \u2212 (TrM )2 + Tr(M m) + 1\n2\u03bc\nnc\n(det M )1/(nc \u2212nf )\n\n(5.2)\n\nwhere Mij \u2261 Q\u0303ai Qja ; hMij i = diag(\u03bb1 , . . . , \u03bbnf ).

The solutions can thus be classified according to the number r of the \u03bbi 's which are of the\norder of \u03bc. The large \u03bbi 's (say \u03bb1 , \u03bb2 , . . . , \u03bbr ) satisfy (setting \u039b1 = 1 from now on)\n\u03bbi \u2212\n\nr\n1 X\n\u03bbk \u2212 \u03bc mi \u2243 0 ;\nnc\n\n(5.4)\n\nk=1\n\nwhich nicely corresponds to Eq. (3.19). The justification for dropping the last term of Eq. (5.1) will\nbe shortly given.\nThe smaller eigenvalues \u03bbp can be found as follows: substituting the approximate solutions for\nthe large \u03bbi 's (see Eq. (3.21))\nr\nX\n1\n\u03bc\nmk = (mi + c)\u03bc\n\u03bbi \u2243 \u03bc mi +\nnc \u2212 r\n\n(5.5)\n\nk=1\n\ninto Eq. (5.1) with p = r + 1, r + 2, . . . , nf , one finds\n(c + mp )\u03bbp =\n\n1\n1\nQ\nQ f\n.\nnc \u2212 nf ( ri=1 \u03bbi * nq=r+1\n\u03bbq )1/nc \u2212nf\n27\n\n(5.6)\n\n\fThis can be further put in the form,\n(\u03bbp )nc \u2212nf\n\nY\nq\n\nAp\n\u03bbq = Qr\ni=1\n\n\u03bbi\n\n=\n\nBp\n,\n\u03bcr\n\n(5.7)\n\nwhere Ap and Bp are some finite constants depending on the masses. By taking the product over\nall p = r + 1, r + 2, . . . , nf , one gets\nY\nconst.\n( \u03bbq )nc \u2212r = r(n \u2212r) ,\n(5.8)\n\u03bc f\nq\ntherefore\n\nY\nq\n\n\u03bbq =\n\nconst.\n* exp 2\u03c0ik/(nc \u2212 r) ,\n\u03bcr(nf \u2212r)/(nc \u2212r)\n\n(k = 1, 2, . . . , nc \u2212 r) .\n\n(5.9)\n\nQ\nOnce q \u03bbq is determined, each of the small eigenvalues can be found uniquely from Eq. (5.6), so\nthat each choice of r large \u03bbi 's yields nc \u2212 r solutions.\nIt is easy to see from Eq. (5.9) that the last term of Eq. (5.1) behaves as\n\u03bc\u2212nc /(nc \u2212r)\n\n(5.10)\n\nand thus is indeed negligible as compared to the terms kept in Eq. (5.4), as long as r < nc .\nThe total number of the vacua at large \u03bc is thus\nN =\n\nnf\nX\nr=0\n\n(nc \u2212 r)\n\n\u0012\n\nnf\nr\n\n\u0013\n\n(5.11)\n\nwhich coincides with the number of the classical vacua, Eq. (3.23).\nWith nf > nc + 1, a na\u0131\u0308ve use of Eq.(4.38) in the limit \u03bc \u2192 \u221e would lead to no supersymmetric\nvacua. The correct vacua can be found by taking into account the nontrivial dual gauge dynamics\nand consequently considering the effective action Eq.(4.48): the analysis of the decoupling limit is\nthen similar to the nf \u2264 nc cases discussed above. A subtle new point however is that now the\nnumber of \"large\" eigenvalues r, can a priori exceed nc . Actually, however, for these values of r the\nlast term of Eq. (5.1) becomes dominant and invalidates the solution (see Eq.(5.10)): the sum over\nr must be truncated at r = nc \u2212 1.11 One thus finds for the number of vacua\n\u0012 \u0013\nnX\nc \u22121\nnf\nfor\nnf > nc + 1 ,\n(5.12)\nN =\n(nc \u2212 r)\nr\nr=0\nwhich is indeed the correct vacuum multiplicity in this case (Eq. (3.23)).\nIn the \u03bc \u2192 \u221e limit, all solutions except for those with r = 0 have some VEVS running away\nto infinity. They do not belong to the space of vacua of the N = 1 supersymmetric QCD. Only the\nr = 0 solutions are characterized by finite VEVS,\n3nc \u2212nf\nnc\n\nmi hQi Q\u0303i i = indep. of i = \u039b1\n\n(\n\nnf\nY\n\nj=1\n\n1/nc\n\nmj\n\n) * e2\u03c0ik/nc ,\n\nthey are indeed the well-known nc vacua of N = 1 SQCD [24].\n11 From\n\nEq.(5.4) it can be seen that the case r = nc is also excluded.\n\n28\n\nk = 1, 2, . . . , nc :\n\n(5.13)\n\n\f5.2\n\nUSp(2nc )\n\nFor small numbers of flavors (nf \u2264 nc ) the equations for \u03bbi 's are (Eq.

(5.14) is negligible, as will be shown shortly. The nf \u2212 r smaller \u03bbp 's are\nfound by substituting Eq. (5.15) into Eq. (5.14):\n1\nQ\n,\nmp \u03bbp = Q\n( i \u03bbi q \u03bbq )1/(nc +1\u2212nf )\n\n(5.16)\n\nwhere i = 1, 2, . . . r runs over the large \u03bb's and p, q = r + 1, r + 2, . . . nf refer to the smaller ones.\nThis can be further rewritten as:\nY\nconst.\n(5.17)\n( \u03bbp )nc +1\u2212r = r(n \u2212r) ,\n\u03bc f\np\nand thus\nY\n\u03bbp =\np\n\nconst.\nexp 2\u03c0ik/(nc + 1 \u2212 r)\n\u03bcr(nf \u2212r)/(nc +1\u2212r)\n\nwith k = 1, 2, . . . , nc + 1 \u2212 r .\n\n(5.18)\n\nOne can see that each choice of r large \u03bbi 's yields nc + 1 \u2212 r solutions. It is easy to show that the\nlast term of Eq. (5.14) is indeed negligible, behaving as\n\u03bc\u2212(nc +1)/(nc +1\u2212r)\n\n(5.19)\n\nas long as r \u2264 nc (see below).\nSumming over r one finds for the total number of the vacua\nN =\n\nnf\nX\nr=0\n\n(nc + 1 \u2212 r)\n\n\u0012\n\nnf\nr\n\n\u0013\n\n(5.20)\n\nwhich agrees (for nf \u2264 nc ) with the number of the classical vacua, Eq. (3.43); the above solutions\ntherefore exhaust all possible vacua of the theory.\nThe analysis for the cases with larger number of flavor (nf > nc + 1) is quite similar to the one\nmade above for smaller values of nf . The only difference is that for r > nc it is no longer correct to\nneglect the last term of Eq. (5.14), as can be seen from Eq. (5.19), hence the sum over r must stop\nat r = nc . The case r = nc + 1 might look subtle, but it is clear from Eq. (5.17) that no solution\nexists in this case either. One thus ends up with the number of vacua,\n\u0012 \u0013\nnc\nX\nnf\nN =\n(nc \u2212 r + 1) *\n,\n(5.21)\nr\nr=0\n29\n\n\fwhich is the correct result (see Eq. (3.43)).\nAgain, in the strict \u03bc = \u221e limit, only the vacua with finite VEVS must be retained. They\nare the solutions correspondintg to r = 0 above: we find precisely nc \u2212 1 solutions of the N = 1\nU Sp(2nc \u2212 1) theory without the adjoint matter fields.\n\n30\n\n\f6\n\nMicroscopic Picture of Dynamical Symmetry Breaking\n\nIn this and in three subsequent sections we seek for a microscopic understanding of the mechanism\nof dynamical flavor symmetry breaking as well as of confinement itself, by studying these theories\nat small \u03bc and small mi . It is necessary to analyze the N = 2 vacua on the Coulomb branch which\nsurvive the \u03bc 6= 0 perturbation.

These points correspond\nto the N = 1 vacua, for the particular N = 1 perturbation, Eq.(1.2).

In the case of SU (nc ) theories we find that the first group\nof N = 1 vacua surviving the the adjoint mass perturbation (\u03bcTr\u03a62 ) and leading to finite VEVS,\n32\n\n\farise from the class 1 (r < nf /2), class 3 (r = nf /2 with nc \u2212 nf /2 odd) and class 4 (r = nf /2 with\nnc \u2212 nf /2 even) CFT, according to the classification of Eguchi et. al [9]. The second group of vacua,\npresent only for nf > nc , on the other hand, arise from the so-called baryonic branch root [17] (see\nEq.(6.18)): these latter CFT can also be regarded as special case of class 1 theories. In these vacua\nthe flavor symmetry is unbroken in the mi \u2192 0 limit.\nIt is important that the number of the vacua and qualitative results about symmetry breaking in\neach of them, can be obtained this way even when the unperturbed solution for {\u03c6a } is not known\nexplicitly.\n\n6.1\n\nSuperconformal Points and N = 1 Vacua for SU(nc )\n\nIt will be seen that the first group of vacua (with multiplicity N1 ) are associated to the points,\nnc\nX\n\n(0)\n\ndiag \u03c6 = ( 0, 0, . . . , 0, \u03c6r+1 , . . . , \u03c6(0)\nnc ),\n| {z }\n\n(6.13)\n\na=r\n\nr\n\n(0)\n\u03c6a 's\n\n\u03c6(0)\na = 0,\n\nin Eq.(6.1), with\nchosen such that the nonzero 2(nc \u2212 r \u2212 1) branch points are paired\ncurves are of the form,\ny 2 \u223c x2r (x \u2212 \u03b201 )2 * * * (x \u2212 \u03b20,nc \u2212r\u22121 )2 (x \u2212 \u03b30 )(x \u2212 \u03ba0 ),\n\nr = 0, 1, 2, . . . , [nf /2].\n\n13\n\n. The\n\n(6.14)\n\nFor r < nf /2 they correspond to the so-called class 1 superconformal theories [9].\nThe special cases with r = nf /2, with nc \u2212 nf /2 odd, and r = nf /2, nc \u2212 nf /2 even, may be\ninterpreted as belonging to class 3 and class 4 [9], respectively. In fact, in these special cases the\nexplicit configuration of \u03c6a 's can be found by using the method of [25].

This will be shown in Appendix D.\n\n33\n\n\fSince these adjoint VEVS leading to Eq.(6.14) or Eq(6.17) break the discrete symmetry spontaneously, they appear in 2nc \u2212 nf copies.14 When (generic) quark masses are turned on, these vacua\nsplit into nfCr -plet of single vacua. The vacua Eq.(6.14), Eq(6.17), correspond to what is called\n\"nonbaryonic\" branch roots in [17].\nThe second group of vacua will be related to the (trivial) superconformal theory\ny 2 = x2\u00f1c (xnc \u2212\u00f1c \u2212 \u039b2 )2 ,\n\n\u00f1c = nf \u2212 nc ,\n\n(6.18)\n\ndiag \u03c6 = ( 0, 0, . . . , 0, \u039b \u03c9 2 , . . . , \u039b \u03c9 2(nc \u2212\u00f1c ))\n| {z }\n\n(6.19)\n\ncorresponding to the adjoint configuration\n\n\u00f1c\n\nwith \u03c9 = e\u03c0i/(nc \u2212\u00f1c ) . This is the \"baryonic\" root of [17].\n\nTo justify these statements we must solve the following problem of purely mathematical nature.\nSuppose that a configuration {\u03c6a } = {\u03c60a } has been found such that the curve of the mi = 0 theory\nreduces to one of the forms, Eq.(6.14) or Eq.(6.18). Now we add small generic bare hyperquark\nP\nmasses mi ; we want to determine the shifts of {\u03c6a }, {\u03c6a } = {\u03c60a +\u03b4\u03c6a }, with constraints a \u03b4\u03c6a = 0\nand \u03b4\u03c6a \u2192 0 as mi \u2192 0, such that the massive curve Eq.(6.1) or Eq.(6.2) is maximally singular\n(with g = nc \u2212 1 double branch points). How many such solutions are there?\nIt turns out that this problem must be treated separately for several different cases: the result of\nthis mass perturbation theory, which will be developed in the last section of this paper (Section 9),\ncan be summarized as follows. For small number of the flavors (nf \u2264 nc ) the total number of the\nN = 1 vacua generated by the mass perturbation from various conformal invariant points Eq.(6.14),\nEq.(6.13), is:\n(nf \u22121)/2\nX\nnf \u22121\n, (nf = odd)\n(6.20)\nN1 = (2nc \u2212 nf )\nnf Cr = (2nc \u2212 nf ) 2\nr=0\n\nnf /2\u22121\n\nN1 = (2nc \u2212 nf )\n\nX\nr=0\n\nnf Cr\n\n+\n\n2nc \u2212 nf\n2\n\nnfCnf /2\n\n= (2nc \u2212 nf ) 2nf \u22121 ,\n\n(nf = even),\n\n(6.21)\n\nwhich exhausts N , Eq.(3.24). In Eq.(6.21) we have taken into account the fact that for even nf ,\nthe vacua with r = nf /2 do not transform under Z2nc \u2212nf but only under Znc \u2212nf /2 . For larger nf\n(nf \u2265 nc + 1), there are also\n\u00f1X\nc \u22121\nN2 =\n(\u00f1c \u2212 r) nfCr .\n(6.22)\nr=0\n\nvacua coming from the \"baryonic root\", Eq.(6.18), Eq.(6.19). The total N1 + N2 correctly matches\nthe known total number of the vacua. The arithmetics is the same as in Eq.(4.49), Eq.(4.50), and\nwill not be repeated.\n14 There is an exception to this. In the case of r = n /2 with n even, the explicit configuration of \u03c6 's (Section 9.1)\na\nf\nf\nshows that the vacuum respects Z2 subgroup of the Z2nc \u2212nf symmetry, showing that it appears in nc \u2212 nf /2 copies\nrather than 2nc \u2212 nf . This fact is crucial in the vacuum counting below Eq.(6.21).\n\n34\n\n\fActually, there is an interesting subtlety in this vacuum counting. In the first group of vacua\nEq.(6.20), Eq.(6.21), the term r = \u00f1c = nf \u2212 nc must be dropped. The vacuum Eq.(6.14) turns\nout to be nonexistent for r = \u00f1c = nf \u2212 nc , see Appendix D. At the same time, however, the mass\nperturbation around the baryonic branch root Eq.(6.18), Eq.(6.19), gives (see Sections 8, 9)\nN2 + (nc \u2212 \u00f1c ) nfC\u00f1c\n\n(6.23)\n\nvacua, the second term of which compensates precisely the missing term in the sum in N1 .\n\n6.2\n\nSuperconformal Points and N = 1 Vacua of USp(2nc ) Theory\n\nThe general curve of U Sp(2nc ) theories is given by\n2\n\n\"\n\nxy = x\n\nnc\nY\n\n(x \u2212\n\na=1\n\n\u03c62a )\n\n+ 2\u039b\n\n2nc +2\u2212nf\n\nm1 * * * mnf\n\n#2\n\n\u2212 4\u039b\n\n2(2nc +2\u2212nf )\n\nnf\nY\n\n(x + m2i ).\n\n(6.24)\n\ni=1\n\nWhen 2nc + 2 \u2212 nf = 0, the theory is superconformal and 2\u039b2nc +2\u2212nf in the above expression is\nreplaced by\n\u03b84\ng(\u03c4 ) = 4 2 4 .\n(6.25)\n\u03b83 + \u03b84\nIt turns out that the first group of N = 1 vacua can be generated from the CFT described by\nChebyshev solutions for mi = 0 theory.\nWhen nf is odd, choose (nf \u2212 1)/2 eigenvalues \u03c61 = * * * = \u03c6(nf \u22121)/2 vanishing.

Therefore the Chebyshev solutions discussed here appear 2nc + 2 \u2212 nf times.\nU Sp(2nc ) theories also have special Higgs branch roots similar to the baryonic roots of the SU (nc )\ntheories.

We require again that the shift of\n\u03c6's be such that the full curve remains maximally sigular (with maximal possible number of double\nroots). The result of mass perturbation analysis, given in Section 9, can be summarized as follows.\nThere are two groups of N = 1 vacua predicted by the Seiberg-Witten curve in U Sp(2nc ) theories.\nThe Chebyshev point Eq.(6.27), Eq.(6.28), spawns N1 = (2nc + 2 \u2212 nf ) * 2nf \u22121 vacua upon mass\nP c\nperturbation, while the special point Eq.(6.30), Eq.(6.31), splits into N2 = \u00f1r=0\n(\u00f1c \u2212 r + 1) nfCr\nvacua. Their sum coincides with the total number of N = 1 vacua found from the semiclassical as\nwell as from large \u03bc analyses.\n\n36\n\n\f7\n\nNumerical Study of N = 1 Vacua in SU(3) and USp(4) Theories\n\nAs a way of checking these results and of illustrating some of their features, we have performed a\nstudy of the rank 2 theories, by numerically determing the points in QMS where the curves y 2 = G(x)\nof Eq.(6.1)-Eq.(6.3) become maximally singular. This has been done by solving the equation\n\u0012\n\u0013\ndG(x)\nR G(x),\n= 0,\n(7.1)\ndx\nwhere R stands for the resultant, using Mathematica.\n\n7.1\n\nSU(3) theory with nf = 1 \u223c 5\n\ni) In the case with nf = 1, one expects from Eq. (3.23) N = 5. From the known curve,\ny 2 = (x3 \u2212 u x \u2212 v)2 \u2212 \u039b1 5 (x + m) ,\n\n(7.2)\n\none finds indeed five vacua, related by an approximate Z5 symmetry. See Fig. 1 for \u039b1 = 2\nand m = 1/64.\nii) In the case with nf = 2 one expects eight vacua, related by an approximate Z4 symmetry\nwhich transform u and v as u \u2192 \u2212u and v \u2192 exp( 23 i\u03c0)v. One finds indeed eight singularities,\ngrouped into two approximate doublets, and four singlets for generic small masses. (see Fig. 2).\niii) For nf = 3, one gets N = 12, with Z3 symmetry. The numerical analysis with the curve:\ny 2 = (x3 \u2212 u x \u2212 v)2 \u2212 \u039b3 3 (x + m1 )(x + m2 )(x + m3 ).\n\n(7.3)\n\nshows that there are indeed twelve vacua satisfying the criterion of the two mutually local\ndyons becoming massless, and they are found in roughly three groups of triplets and three\nsinglets of singularities. In the equal mass limit each of the three triplets coalesce to a point\nin the (u, v) space, showing that the massless monopoles there are in the representation 3 of\nSU (3), while those at the other vacua are singlets (see Fig. 3), in complete agreement with\nthe analysis of previous sections.\niv) For nf = 4, Eq. (3.23) gives N = 17 vacua. It is reassuring that one indeed finds from Eq.(7.1)\nseventeen vacua for generic and unequal masses 15 . At small masses these vacua are grouped\ninto an approximate sextet, two quartets and three singlets, suggesting the assignements of\nrank 2, 1 and 0 antisymmetric representation of SU (4) global flavor group. The number of the\nvacua (six) in the limit of equal masses is consistent with this assignment (see Fig. 4)\nIn a quartet vacuum, the condensation of the monopoles breaks the SU (4) symmetry to U (3),\nwhile in a singlet vacua the flavor symmetry remains unbroken.\n15 As\n\na further check, we verified the number of the vacua by using another parametrization of the curve given by\nMinahan et al. [26].\n\n37\n\n\fSomething very interesting happens in the sextet vacua. Namely, in the equal mass or massless\nlimit, we find that four branch points in the x plane coalesce, suggesting conformal invariant\nvacuum. In fact, this result was to be expected, since these \"sextet\" vacua are examples of\nthe particular class (\"class 3\" ) of nontrivial conformal invariant theories studied in [9], where\n2r branch points in the x plane coalesce, where r = nf /2. This is known to occurs for SU (3)\ntheories with nf = 4 at special values of u and v when the quark masses are all equal (m):\ntheir precise position is [9] U = 3M 2 , and V = 2M 3 , where u = (7 + 24M + 36M 2 )/12 and\nv = (11 + 45M + 54M 2 + 54M 3 )/27 and M = m \u2212 1/3, and the curve becomes\ny 2 = (x + m)4 (x + 1 \u2212 2m)(x \u2212 1 \u2212 2m).\n\n(7.4)\n\nThe values of u, v found by us numerically from the criterion of N = 1 vacua precisely match\nthese values, showing that this particular conformal vacuum survives the N = 1 perturbation.\nIn order to determine which particles are actually present, it is necessary to study the monodromy transformation properties of (aD1 , aD2 , a1 , a2 ) [1, 2, 3] around this particular singularity. In Appendix E we present such an analysis (the analysis is actually done for all seventeen\nvacua of SU (3), nf = 4 model). Our result shows that the massless particles (in the \u03bc = 0\nlimit) present at this singularity have quantum numbers\n(nm1 , nm2 , ne1 , ne2 ) = (0, 1, 0, 1), (1, 2, 2, 0), (1, 1, 0, 1).\n\n(7.5)\n\nAs these particles are relatively nonlocal, such a vacuum is conformal invariant [8].\nThis is an example of a very general phenomenon, already discussed in the previous section.\nv) Finally, for nf = 5 we verified (for large masses) the presence of twenty\u2013three quantum vacua,\nin accordance with Eq. (3.23). From the curve:\n\u0013\n\u0013\nnc\n5 \u0012\n5 \u0012\nY\nY\nY\n\u039b5\n\u039b5\n2\n2\n3\n2\nx + mi +\ny =\n(x \u2212 \u03c6a ) \u2212 4\u039b5\nx + mi +\n= (x \u2212 u x \u2212 v) \u2212 4\u039b5\n,\nnc\nnc\na=1\ni=1\ni=1\n(7.6)\nin the small mass limit, the grouping of the singularities found is compatible with the assignment into a decuplet, two quintets and three singlets of (approximate) global SO(5) symmetry.\nThe number of vacua (six) in the equal mass case, is in agreement with this structure.\nIn particular, the decuplet vacua corresponds to the curve,\n\u0012\n\u00134 \"\u0012\n\u0013#\n\u00132\n\u0012\n\u039b\n2\u039b\n\u039b\n5\n5\n5\nx\u2212\n,\n\u2212 2m \u2212 4\u039b5 x + m +\ny2 = x + m +\nnc\nnc\nnc\n\n(7.7)\n\nand corresponds to the class 1 (trivial) conformal field theory [9].\nFurthermore, since nf > nc + 1 in this case, the theory belongs to the \"large nf \" class of\nSec. 4.3 we expect N2 = 7 (see Eq. (4.47)) of vacua to show particular properties. We find\nthat indeed seven of the vacua (in the equal mass limit, a quintet and two singlets) approache\nthe form\ny 2 = x4 (x \u2212 \u039b)2\n(7.8)\nin the mi \u2192 0 limit, after a shift in x. This is exactly the structure of the singularities at the\nroot of the baryonic branch[17].\n38\n\n\f7.2\n\nUSp(2nc ) with 2nf Flavors\n\ni) For U Sp(4) with nf = 1, we do find five vacua, as shown in Fig. 5, consistently with the\napproximate Z5 symmetry.\nii) For nf = 2 with the same gauge group, eight quantum vacua are found to group into four\ndoublets, showing that monopoles appear in the fundamental representation (2, 1) and (1, 2),\nof the flavor group SO(2nf ) \u223c SU (2) \u00d7 SU (2). Their condensation leaves a U (2) subgroup\ninvariant, in accordance with the na\u0131\u0308ve expectation. In the equal mass limit one of the SU (2)\nsymmetries is exact. It is seen that in this case the SU (2) symmety is broken spontaneously\nin four of the vacua, while in four others it is not, in perfect agreement with what was found\nin Sec. 4 (see Fig. 6).\niii) For the U Sp(4) theory with nf = 3, the formula (3.44) and the discrete symmetry suggests\nthat monopoles form a quartet (12 vacua grouped into three quartets of nearby singularities).\nThis is indeed the case as shown in Fig. 7. The condensation of 4 of SO(6) \u223c SU (4) breaks\nthe chiral symmetry to U (3), as expected.\niv) The theory with four flavors (and the same gauge group) has seventeen vacua. In the massless\nlimit, they group in two spinors (octets) and one singlet of the gloabal symmetry SO(8). In the\ncase of degenerate but nonvanishing masses, the spinors 8 of SO(8) can split in two possible\nways: 1 + 6 + 1 of U (4) in one case, and with 4 + 4\u2217 of U (4) in the other. This is indeed\nthe situation shown in Fiq. 8. This shows the correctness of our assignment and that in the\nmassless limit the condensation of the monopole in the spinor representation of SO(8) breaks\nthe chiral symmetry to U (4).\nv) Finally, we verified that the theory U Sp(4) with five flavors has indeed twenty-three quantum\nvacua.\n\n39\n\n\f8\n\nEffective Lagrangian Description of N = 1 Vacua at Small \u03bc\n\nA deeper insight into physics at small mi and \u03bc can be obtained by re-examining the works\nof Argyres, Plesser and Seiberg [17] and Argyres, Plesser and Shapere [18], who showed how the\nnon-renormalization theorem of the hyperK\u00e4hler metric on the Higgs branch could be used to show\nthe persistence of unbroken non-abelian gauge group at the \"roots\" of the Higgs branches where\nthey intersect the Coulomb branch. In fact, they found two kinds of such submanifolds, called \"nonbaryonic branch\" (or mixed-branch) roots, and \"baryonic branch\" roots (these terminologies refer\nspecifically to the SU (nc ) theory, but the situation is similar also in U Sp(2nc ) theory). The latter\nis present only for larger values of the flavor (nf > nc ) while the former exists always.\nBelow, we show how the low-energy effective action description of [17, 18] match our findings of\nSections 3 - 7, after correcting a few errors and clarifying some issues left unclear there. In doing\nso, a very clear and interesting picture of the infrared dyamics of our theories emerges, which was\nsummarized in the Introduction.\nLet us discuss the SU (nc ) theories first.\n\n8.1\n\nSU(nc )\n\nThe non\u2013baryonic roots are further classified into sub\u2013branches characterized by an unbroken\nSU (r) \u00d7 U (1)nc \u2212r gauge symmetry for r \u2264 [nf /2], with nf flavor of massless hypermultiplets in\nthe fundamental representation of SU (r), as well as nc \u2212 r \u2212 1 singlet \"monopole\" hypermultiplets\nhaving charges only in the U (1)nc \u2212r gauge sector.

Careful perturbation of the curve by the quark masses made in Section 9\nshows that there are (nc \u2212 nf /2) nfCnf /2 vacua.\nThe total number of N = 1 vacua is then given by N1 of Eq.(6.20), Eq.(6.21), after summing\nover r.

These vacua describe the vacua with\nunbroken U (nf ) symmetry, which are known to exist from the large \u03bc analysis. The total number\nof vacua of this group found here agrees with Eq.(6.22) at the large \u03bc regime.\nThe second type of vacua in Eqs. (8.24,8.25) has one of the ek = \u1ebdk = 0 (hence nc \u2212 \u00f1c = 2nc \u2212 nf\n\u221a\nchoices) while \u2202W/\u2202\u03c8k = 0 requires quarks to condense with q = q\u0303 \u223c \u03bc\u039b. Dropping ek = \u1ebdk = 0\nfrom the Lagrangian, it becomes the same as that of the non-baryonic root Eqs. (8.1,8.2) and gives\n(2nc \u2212 nf ) nfC\u00f1c vacua. This precisely compensates the exclusion of r = \u00f1c in the sum for the\nnon-baryonic roots and the correct total number of vacua N1 + N2 is obtained.\nWe thus find that both the number and the symmetry properties of the N = 1 theories at small\nadjoint mass \u03bc match exactly those found at large \u03bc. For vacua with r = 1, the \"quarks\" in the\neffective Lagrangian (8.1) are nothing but the U (1)nc \u22121 monopoles in the fundamental representation\nof U (nf ); this is checked by studying the monodromy around the singularity which showed that the\n\"quarks\" are indeed magnetically charged. Therefore the standard picture of confinement and flavor\nsymmetry breaking by condensation of flavor-non-singlet monopoles is valid for these vacua.\nFor general vacua r > 1 associated with various nonbaryonic roots, the effective Lagrangian\n(8.1) describes correctly the physics of N = 1 vacua at small \u03bc, in terms of magnetic quarks of\na non Abelian SU (r) \u00d7 U (1)nc \u2212r theory. In contrast to the r = 1 case, these quarks cannot be\nidentified with the semiclassical monopoles of the maximally Abelian U (1)nc \u22121 group. Note that\nthe condensation of such monopoles in the rank-r anti-symmetric tensor representation, which might\nbe suggested from the number of the singularities which group into a nearby cluster in the small mi\nlimit and at the same time from the semiclassical analysis (see Appendix B), would have yielded\nthe correct pattern of symmetry breaking; at the same time, however, it would have led to an\nuncomfortably large number of Nambu-Goldstone bosons associated to the accidental SU (nfCr )\nsymmetry. The system avoids this paradox elegantly, by having magnetic quarks as low-energy\ndegrees of freedom and having these condensed. These facts, and the comparison of their quantum\nnumbers, lead us to conclude that, as we approach the non-baryonic roots from semi-classical (large\nVEV) region on the Coulomb branch, the semi-classical monopoles in the rank-r anti-symmetric\ntensor representation are smoothly matched to \"baryons\" of the SU (r) theory,\n\u01eba1 ...ar qai11 qai22 . . . qairr ,\n44\n\n(8.35)\n\n\fand break up (the system being infrared-free) into weakly coupled magnetic quarks, before becoming\nmassless.\nThe case r = nf /2 is exceptional and highly non-trivial. Although the analysis leading to\nEq.(8.19), Eq.(8.22), is formally valid in this case also, physics is really different. The low energy\ndegrees of freedom involve relatively nonlocal states, arising from the nontrivial, class 3 CFT [9]. In\nthis case, the theory is in the same universality class as the finite SU (nf /2) theories. For an explicit\ncheck with monodromy, see Appendix E, for the simplest example of this type, r = 2 vacua of the\nSU (3) theory with nf = 4.\nAs for the second group of vacua with vanishing VEVS found at the \"baryonic root\", they are in\nthe free-magnetic phase, with observable (magnetic) quarks, weakly interacting with SU (nf \u2212 nc )\ngauge fields.\n\n8.2\n\nUSp(2nc )\n\nIn the U Sp(2nc) gauge theories, the first type of vacua can be identified more easily by first considering the equal but novanishing quark masses. The adjoint VEVS in the curve Eq.(6.24) can be\nchosen so as to factor out the behavior\ny 2 = (x + m2 )2r [. . .],\n\nr = 1, 2, . . .\n\n(8.36)\n\nwhich describes an SU (r)\u00d7U (1)nc \u2212r+1 gauge theory with nf quarks. See Section 9.2. These (trivial)\nsuperconformal theories belong in fact to the same universality classes as those found in the SU (nc )\ngauge theory, as pointed out by Eguchi and others [9]. They are therefore described by exactly the\nsame Lagrangian Eq.(8.1). At each vacuum with r, the symmetry (of equal mass theory, U (nf )) is\nbroken spontaneously as\nU (nf ) \u2192 U (r) \u00d7 U (nf \u2212 r).\n(8.37)\nWhen a small mass splitting is added among mi 's, each of the r vacuum splits into\nleading to the total of\n\nnfCr\n\nvacua,\n\n(nf \u22121)/2\n\n(2nc + 2 \u2212 nf )\nnf /2\u22121\n\n(2nc + 2 \u2212 nf )\n\nX\nr=0\n\nnf Cr\n\n+\n\nX\n\nnf Cr\n\nr=0\n\n2nc + 2 \u2212 nf\n2\n\n= (2nc + 2 \u2212 nf ) 2nf \u22121 ,\n\nnfCnf /2\n\n(nf = odd)\n\n= (2nc + 2 \u2212 nf ) 2nf \u22121 ,\n\n(8.38)\n\n(nf = even), (8.39)\n\nvacua of this type, consistently with Eq. (3.44). These N = 1 vacua seem to have been overlooked\nin [18] altogether17 .\nIn the massless limit the underlying theories possess a larger, flavor SO(2nf ) symmetry. We\nknow also from the large \u03bc analysis that in the first group of vacua (with finite vevs), this symmetry\n17 With a hindsight, we see that this was inevitable: as we show below, there is no local effective Lagrangian\ndescription of low-energy physics in the mi = 0 limit and Argyres, Plesser and Shapere [18] worked precisely in such\na regime.\n\n45\n\n\fis broken spontaneously to U (nf ) symmetry always. How can such a result be consistent with\nEq.(8.37) of equal (but nonvanishing) mass theory?\nWhat happens is that in the massless limit various N = 1 vacua with different symmetry properties Eq.(8.37) (plus eventually other singularities) coalesce. The location of this singularity can\nbe obtained exactly in terms of Chebyshev polynomials, and is given by Eqs. (6.26)-(6.29). At the\nsingularity there are mutually non-local dyons and hence the theory is at a non-trivial infrared fixed\npoint. In the example of U Sp(4) theory with nf = 4, we have explicitly verified this by determining\nthe singularities and branch points at finite equal mass m and by studying the limit m \u2192 0. There\nis no description in terms of a weakly coupled local field theory, just as in the case r = nf /2 for\nSU (nc ) theories. Since the global flavor symmetry is SO(2nf ), these superconformal theories belong\nto a different universality class as compared to those at finite mass or to those of SU (nc ) theories.\nWhen nf is even, the theory is in the same universality class as the finite U Sp(nf \u2212 2) theories.\nWhen nf is odd, the theory is in a different universality class of \"strong-coupled conformal theories.\"\nWe find this behavior resonable because the semi-classical monopoles are in the spinor representation of the SO(2nf ) flavor group and, in contrast to the situation in SU (nc ) theories, cannot\n\"break up\" into quarks in the vector representation. They are therefore likely to persist at the singularity and in general make the theory superconformal. We indeed checked that there are mutually\nnon-local degrees of freedom using monodromy of the curve for U Sp(4) theory with nf = 5.18 We\nbelieve that the situation with higher nf is also non-local; this is because a local effective low-energy\nLagrangian of massless monopoles in the spinor representation of the flavor group would have an accidental U (2nf \u22121 ) symmetry and would lead to an unacceptably large number of Nambu\u2013Goldstone\nmultiplets. Once the quark masses are turned on, however, the flavor group reduces to (at least)\nU (nf ) and it becomes possible for monopoles to break up into quarks; this explains the behavior in\nthe equal mass case.\nAs for the second group of vacua, the situation is more analogous to the case of SU (nc ) theories.\nThe superpotential reads in this case (by adding mass terms to Eq.(5.10) of [18]):\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n2nc +2\u2212nf\nX\n1\nmij i j ab\nW = \u03bc \uf8edTr \u03c62 + \u039b\nxa \u03c8a \uf8f8 + \u221a qai \u03c6ab qci J bc +\nq q J\n2 a b\n2\na=1\n2nc +2\u2212nf\n\n+\n\nX\n\na=1\n\nwhere J = i\u03c32 \u2297 1nc and\n18 The\n\n\u0001\n\u03c8a ea \u1ebda + Sai mi ea \u1ebda ,\nm = \u2212i\u03c32 \u2297 diag (m1 , m2 , . . . , mnf ) .\n\n(8.40)\n\n(8.41)\n\ncase nf = 3, however, is special. In this case, the analysis of the curve in Section 9.2 tells us that the\ntheory at the Chebyshev vacuum is the same as the SU (2) theory with nf = 3. Seiberg and Witten studied this case\n[2] and found that the singularity can be described in terms of massless monopoles in the spinor representation of\nthe flavor SO(6) group interacting locally with the magnetic photon. Note that there is no problem with unwanted\nNambu\u2013Goldstone multiplets in this case (see Section 8 in [2]).\n\n46\n\n\fBy minimizing the potential, we find\nN2 =\n\n\u00f1c\nX\nr=0\n\n(\u00f1c \u2212 r + 1)nf Cr\n\n(8.42)\n\nvacua, which precisely matches the number of the vacua of the second group, with squark VEVS\nbehaving as\n\u221a\nmi \u21920\nqi , q\u0303i \u223c \u03bcmi \u2212\u2192\n0.\n(8.43)\nThese are the desired SO(2nf ) symmetric vacua.\n\n47\n\n\f9\n\nQuark-Mass Perturbation on the Curve\n\nIn this section we develop a perturbation theory in the quark masses for the singularities of\nthe Seiberg-Witten curves of SU (nc ) and U Sp(2nc) theories, around certain conformal points. The\nresults of this section allows us, on the one hand, to establish the connection between the classes of\nCFT singularities of N = 2 space of vacua and the N = 1 vacua surviving the perturbation \u03bc\u03a62 (as\ndiscussed in Section 6), and on the other, to identify the N = 1 vacua at small \u03bc (whose physics\nwas discussed in the previous section) with those found at large \u03bc.\n\n9.1\n\nPerturbation around CFT Points: SU(nc )\n\ni) Generic r (r <\n\nnf\n2\n\n) and formulation of the problem.\n(0)\n\n(0)\n\nSuppose the conformal point (Eq.(6.13)), diag \u03c6 = ( 0, 0, . . . , 0, \u03c6r+1 , . . . , \u03c6nc ),\n| {z }\nr\n\nwhere the full curve with mi = 0\n2\n\ny =\n\nnc\nY\n\n2\n\n(x \u2212 \u03c6k ) + 4\u039b\n\n2nc \u2212nf\n\nnf\nY\n\nPnc\n\na=r\n\n(0)\n\n\u03c6a = 0,\n\n(x + mj )|mi =0\n\n(9.1)\n\nj=1\n\nk=1\n\ntakes the form\ny 2 = x2r (x \u2212 \u03b201 )2 * * * (x \u2212 \u03b20,nc \u2212r\u22121 )2 (x \u2212 \u03b30 )(x \u2212 \u03ba0 ),\n\nr = 0, 1, 2, . . . , [nf /2]\n\n(9.2)\n\nis given.

There are thus nfCr\nsolutions of this type, according to which masses are chosen to construct the solution.

To satisfy the first equation (9.22) down to O(mnf +1 ), all we\nneed is to set \u03b11 = \u03bb1 , etc. The second equation (9.23) is then approximated by keeping only\nthe first power in (\u03b11 \u2212 \u03bb1 ) (in other words, only keeping b = 1 in the sum),\n\u2032\n\nF (\u03b11 ) = 2(\u03b11 \u2212 \u03bb1 )\n\nY\n\n2\n\n(\u03b11 \u2212 \u03bba ) +\n\na6=1\n\n4\n\u039bnf \u22122r\n\nnf\nX\nY\n(\u03b11 + mi ) = 0.\n\n(9.24)\n\nj=1 i6=j\n\nBarring an accidental cancellations between \u03b11 and other \u03bba (a 6= 1), we find\n\u03b11 \u2212 \u03bb1 \u223c O(mnf \u22121 /\u039bnf \u22122nc /m2(r\u22121) ) = O(mnf \u22122r+1 /\u039bnf \u22122r ).\n\n(9.25)\n\nUsing this fact, the first term in (9.22) is O(mnf \u22122r+1 /\u039bnf \u22122r )2 \u00d7 O(m2(r\u22121) ), which is much\nsmaller than the second term of O(mnf ). Therefore, the second term must vanish by itself,\nwhich requires \u03b11 = \u2212m1 etc. Repeating the same analysis for every \u03b1a , we need to choose r\nmasses out of nf and assign \u03b1a = \u2212ma etc. Then we should retain only the term j = 1 in the\nsecond term in Eq.

However, the gauge invariant symmetric polynomials of \u03c6k vanish for odd powers because of the equal number of positive and negative ones\nwith the same absolute values. Therefore the Chebyshev solutions discussed here appear only\nnc \u2212 nf /2 times. This point is crucial for the vacuum counting (see Eq.(6.21)) to work out\ncorrectly.\nWe first study the specific case of 2nc = nf + 2. More general cases will be seen to reduce to\nthis case.

This gives\nexplicit solutions to the vacuum.\nOnce we have this solution, however, we can obtain other 2nf \u22121 \u2212 1 solutions as follows. First\nnote that the curve Eq. (6.24) is invariant under changing signs of even number of masses.\nTherefore, we can change signs of even number of masses from the solution (9.109). This\ngives 2nf \u22121 solutions in total agreeing with N1 in the large \u03bc analysis. This solution therefore\ndecomposes under U (nf ) for the equal mass case as 2nf \u22121 = nfC0 + nfC2 + * * * nfCnf \u22121 ,\nreminiscent of the spinor representation.\nThe case of equal mass deserves further comments. As noted above, we can flip the signs of\neven number of quark masses, and therefore a general situation has 2r negative masses \u2212m\nand nf \u2212 2r positive masses m. Let us study the location of branch points in this situation.\nThe curve studied above has the form\ny 2 = \u22124\u039b2\n\nnc\nY\n\n(x \u2212 \u03b1a )2\n\na=1\n\nnear x \u223c 0.

If 4r < nf , we can factor (x + m2 )2r\nfrom above and hence (x + m2 )4r from the curve. We interpret this factor as the emergence\nof SU (2r) gauge theory. If 4r > nf , we can factor (x + m2 )nf \u22122r from above and hence\n(x + m2 )2nf \u22124r from the curve. We interpret this factor as the emergence of SU (nf \u2212 2r) =\nSU (2(nc \u2212r)+1) gauge theory. Combining both, we see that gauge groups up to SU ((nf \u22121)/2)\nare possible. This fact can also be understood from the Higgs branch picture. When quark\nmasses are large and equal, one can cancel quark masses by the adjoint VEVS classically\n(squark singularity) and obtain U (k) gauge theories k = 0, 1, * * * , (nf \u2212 1)/2 depending on\nhow many components of the adjoint field is used to cancel the quark masses. These are\nall infrared-free theories and the gauge fields survive the quantum effects. While smoothly\ndecreasing the quark masses, the Higgs branch emanating from the squark singularity does\nnot change due to the non-renormalization theorem and hence the U (k) theories survive to\nthe small mass studied using the Coulomb branch. The effective low-energy Lagrangian which\ndescribes physics around the squark singularity is therefore nothing but that of Argyres\u2013\nPlesser\u2013Seiberg for SU (nc ) theories at the non-baryonic roots [17]. We have shown (Section\n8.1) that these theories indeed produce nfCk vacua upon \u03bc 6= 0 and generic quark mass\nperturbation. Therefore the whole picture nicely fits together. On the other hand, the strictly\nmassless case has the high singularity x2nc and appears to give a new superconformal theory\nwith a global symmetry SO(2nf ). We do not know of a weakly coupled description of this\nsingularity in terms of a local field theory. We have checked that this singularity indeed\nproduces mutually non-local dyons for nc = 2 and nf = 5.\nNow we come back to the case of smaller nf . Around the Chebyshev solution in the presence\nof quark masses, the curve is\nxy 2\n\n=\n\n\uf8ee\n\n\uf8f0x\n\n(nf \u22121)/2\n\nY\n\na=1\n\nnc \u2212(nf \u22121)/2\n\n(x \u2212 \u03c62a )\n\n\u22124\u039b2(2nc +2\u2212nf )\n\nY\n\n(x \u2212 \u03c62k \u2212 \u03ba2k ) + 2\u039b2nc +2\u2212nf m1 * * * mnf \uf8fb\n\nk=1\n\nnf\n\nY\n\n\uf8f92\n\n(x + m2i ),\n\n(9.112)\n\ni=1\n\nwhere \u03c62k are given by those for the Chebyshev polynomial. However, for the purpose of\nstudying the behavior around x = 0, both x and the shifts \u03ba2k can be ignored relative to \u03c62k .\n\n63\n\n\fWe need to know\n\nQnc \u2212(nf \u22121)/2\nk=1\n\n(\u2212\u03c62k ).

The rest of the analysis therefore follows exactly the same as in\n2nc = nf \u2212 1 case. Even when other Chebyshev solutions obtained by Z2nc +2\u2212nf are used,\nthey simply amount to the change of phase of \u039b in the above approximate curve and the\nanalysis remains the same.\nii) Chebyshev point: even nf\nConsider now even nf cases. Again, let us study the specific case of nf = 2nc first.

There is another isolated zero\nat x = \u00b14\u039b2 . There is also a branch point at x = \u221e. We first consider the case \u03c62nc = +2\u039b2\nand will come back to the case \u03c62nc = \u22122\u039b2 later on.\n\nUnder the perturbation by generic quark masses, we go back to the original curve.

Let us study the location of branch points in this situation.\nThe curve studied above has the form\n2\n\ny =\n\n\u22124\u039b2 \u03b12nc\n\nnY\nc \u22121\na=1\n\n(x \u2212 \u03b1a )2\n\n(9.129)\n\nnear x \u223c 0.

We\ninterpret this factor as the emergence of SU (2r) gauge theory. If 4r > nf , we can factor\n(x + m2 )nf \u22122r from above and hence (x + m2 )2nf \u22124r from the curve. We interpret this factor\nas the emergence of SU (nf \u2212 2r) = SU (2(nc \u2212 r)) gauge theory. This fact can also be\nunderstood from the Higgs branch picture. When quark masses are large and equal, one can\ncancel quark masses by the adjoint VEV classically (squark singularity) and obtain U (k) gauge\ntheories k = 0, 1, * * * , nf /2 = nc depending on how many components of the adjoint field is\nused to cancel the quark masses. These are all infrared-free or scale-invariant theories and\nthe gauge fields survive the quantum effects. While smoothly decreasing the quark masses,\nthe Higgs branch emanating from the squark singularity does not change due to the nonrenormalization theorem and hence the U (k) theories survive to the small mass studied using\nthe Coulomb branch. The effective low-energy Lagrangian which describes physics around the\nsquark singularity is therefore the one given by Argyres\u2013Plesser\u2013Seiberg for SU (nc ) theories\nat the non-baryonic roots [17]. These theories indeed produce nfCk vacua upon \u03bc 6= 0 and\ngeneric quark mass perturbation. Therefore the whole picture nicely fit together. On the\nother hand, the strictly massless case has the high singlarity x2nc and appears to give a new\nsuperconformal theory with a global symmetry SO(2nf ). We do not know of a weakly coupled\ndescription of this singularity in terms of a weakly coupled local field theory. We have checked\nthat this singularity indeed produces mutually non-local dyons for nc = 2 and nf = 4.\nNow we come back to the case of smaller nf . Around the Chebyshev solution in the presence\nof quark masses, we study the curve\n\uf8f92\n\uf8ee\nnc +1\u2212nf /2\nnf /2\u22121\nY\nY\n(x \u2212 \u03c62k \u2212 \u03ba2k ) + 2\u039b2nc +2\u2212nf m1 * * * mnf \uf8fb\nxy 2 = \uf8f0x\n(x \u2212 \u03c62a )\na=1\n\nk=1\n\n\u22124\u039b2(2nc +2\u2212nf )\n\nnf\nY\n\n(x + m2i ),\n\n(9.131)\n\ni=1\n\nwhere \u03c62k are given by those for the Chebyshev polynomial. However, for the purpose of\nstudying the behavior around x = 0, both x and the shifts \u03ba2k can be ignored relative to \u03c62k .\nQnc +1\u2212nf /2\nWe need to know k=1\n(\u2212\u03c62k ).

The rest of the analysis therefore is exactly the same\nas in the 2nc = nf case. With other Chebyshev solutions obtained by Z2nc +2\u2212nf , the relative\nsign between the two terms in the square bracket changes. This sign change corresponds to two\ndifferent solutions \u03c62nc = \u00b12\u039b2 in the 2nc = nf case and hence they give decompositions into\neven-rank (odd-rank) anti-symmetric tensors under U (nf ) for the equal mass perturbation,\nrespectively.\niii) Special (baryonic-like) point\nU Sp(2nc ) theories also have special Higgs branch root (Eq.(6.30)-Eq.(6.32)), similar to the\nbaryonic roots of the SU (nc ) theories. This point is obtained by setting \u03c61 , * * * , \u03c6nc \u2212\u00f1c 6= 0,\nand \u03c6nc \u2212\u00f1c +1 = * * * = \u03c6nc = 0 in the original U Sp(2nc ) curve\n#2\n\" n\nnf\nnf\nc\nY\nY\nY\n2\n2nc +2\u2212nf\n2\n(x + m2i ),\n(9.134)\nmi \u2212 \u039b4nc +4\u22122nf\n(x \u2212 \u03c6a ) + \u039b\nxy = x\na=1\n\ni=1\n\ni=1\n\n(here and below, \u00f1c = nf \u2212 nc \u2212 2), leading to\ny 2 = x2\u00f1c +1\n\nncY\n\u2212\u00f1c\nk=1\n\n(x \u2212 \u03a6k )2 \u2212 4\u039b4nc +4\u22122nf xnf \u22121 .\n\n(9.135)\n\nNonvanishing \u03a6's are taken as\n(\u03a621 , * * * , \u03a62k , * * * , \u03a62nc \u2212\u00f1c ) = \u039b2 (\u03c9, * * * , \u03c9 2k\u22121 , * * * , \u03c9 2(nc \u2212\u00f1c )\u22121 ),\n\n(9.136)\n\nwhere \u03c9 = e\u03c0i/(nc \u2212\u00f1c ) . Note that our \u03c9 is the square root of \u03c9 in Argyres\u2013Plesser\u2013Seiberg\nQnc \u2212\u00f1c\npaper because of later convenience. Then the product k=1\n(x \u2212 \u03a6k ) can be rewritten as\n2(nc \u2212\u00f1c )\nnc \u2212\u00f1c\n+\u039b\n, and the curve becomes\nx\ni\nh\ny 2 = x2\u00f1c +1 (xnc \u2212\u00f1c + \u039b2(nc \u2212\u00f1c ) )2 \u2212 4\u039b4nc +4\u22122nf xnc \u2212\u00f1c\n=\n\nx2\u00f1c +1 (xnc \u2212\u00f1c \u2212 \u039b2(nc \u2212\u00f1c ) )2 .\n\n(9.137)\n\nThe double zeros of the factor in the parenthesis are at\nx = \u039b2 \u03c9 2 , \u039b2 \u03c9 4 , * * * , \u039b2 \u03c9 2k , * * * , \u039b2 \u03c9 2(nc \u2212\u00f1c ) = \u039b2 .\n\n(9.138)\n\nOne crucial difference from the SU (nc ) case is that there is no choice but keep all of the \"large\"\ndouble zeros because the zeros at x = 0 has an odd power 2\u00f1c + 1 and hence leaves one of\n68\n\n\fthe zeros not doubled anyway. This explains why the separation between N1 and N2 works\nout nicely with the U Sp(2nc) theories, but one of the r-roots gets mixed up with the baryonic\nroot for SU (nc ) theories. Another crucial difference is that there is no constraint among \u03c6a 's.\nTherefore we can just fix \"large\" ones and study the low-energy curve.

The Chebyshev point Eq.(6.27), Eq.(6.28), gives rise to N1 = (2nc + 2 \u2212 nf ) * 2nf \u22121\nvacua upon mass perturbation , while the special point Eq.(6.30), Eq.(6.31), leads to N2 =\nP\u00f1c\nr=0 (\u00f1c \u2212 r + 1)nf Cr vacua. Their sum coincides with the total number of N = 1 vacua found\nfrom the semiclassical as well as from large \u03bc analyses.\n69\n\n\fAcknowledgment\nOne of the authors (K.K.) thanks Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, University of California, Berkeley, and ITP, University of California Santa Barbara, for their warm hospitality.

To study the monodromies one sets (u, v) slightly\noff the singularity interested, and lets (u, v) make a small circle around it in the parameter space\n(QMS). From the way the branch points move around and the branch cuts get entangled one easily\nfinds the manodromy matrix for aD1 , aD2 , a1 , a2 . One must also study how the positions of the\nbranch points and cuts are varied as one goes from one singularity to another. This allows one\nto determine the homology cycles defining various periods, aD1 , aD2 , a1 , a2 , in a globally consistent\nmanner. The quantum numbers of the massless states at each singularity are found from the nonvanishing eigenvectors of the monodromy matrix thus obtained. In many cases, the movements of\nthe branch points can be studied analytically as well: we illustrate below how such a check can be\nmade, in some examples.\nThe SU (3) gauge theory with four flavor has 17 vacua for generic quark masses and for a nonvanishing adjoint mass. They collapse to six vacua in the limit of equal quark masses, three singlets,\ntwo quartets and one sextet. For \u039b = 2 and m = 2\u22126 they are at:\n\n1.\n2.\n3.\n4.\n5.\n6.\n\n(u, v) = (0, 0)\n(u, v) = (\u22120.92, \u22120.14)\n(u, v) = (\u22120.85, 0.09)\n(u, v) = (\u22121.05, \u22120.02)\n(u, v) = (\u22120.95, \u22120.01)\n(u, v) = (\u22121.00, \u22120.06)\n\nsextet\nsinglet\nsinglet\nquartet\nquartet\nsinglet\n\nThe branch points and cuts (dotted lines) are chosen as shown in Fig. 9.
