Since the original COBE-DMR detection, numerous ground based, balloon borne\nand satellite measurements of the temperature fluctuations have been made at many different\nlocations on the sky. These CMB anisotropy measurements have brought us to an era of precision\ncosmology, enabling us to directly probe the thermal history of our universe.\nThere are a number of physical processes that produce anisotropies in the microwave sky\non a range of scales. Primary fluctuations are imprinted on the CMB during decoupling or\neven before. For example, acoustic oscillations are generated before decoupling through the\ngravitational collapse of matter into the potential wells. Secondary perturbations are generated\nbetween decoupling and the present. These include the distortion of the blackbody spectrum as\nphotons pass through regions of hot ionised gas. Refer to example reviews for more details of\nthe physics of the CMB anisotropies 2,3 .\nThe CMB harbours the imprint of the initial perturbations that seeded the gravitational\ncollapse of structure. This signal has been filtered through the dynamical evolution of the\n\n\fFigure 1: The power spectrum of temperature fluctuations from COBE-DMR and WMAP.

The analysis of the CMB anisotropy data can therefore not only advance\nour understanding of the process of structure formation but also reveal fundamental properties\nof the universe such as its expansion rate, geometry and the amount of matter it contains. As the\nanisotropy detections become increasingly accurate, we can test the predictions of theoretical\ncosmology and extend our understanding of our evolving universe.\nIn this talk, presented at the 5th Rencontres du Vietnam 2004, we give an overview of\nthe cosmological implications of the CMB data. We briefly discuss the observational progress\nthat has been made over the past decade and comment on recent cosmological parameter constraints. We describe the current concordant model and explain how simultaneously analysing\ncombinations of independent observational data sets can tighten cosmological constraints. We\nalso discuss the implications of the current data for inflation, reionisation and dark energy and\nsummarise what we can expect the next decade to hold for CMB cosmology.\n2\n2.1\n\nThe Observational Data\nFirst Light\n\nThe potential for the CMB to become a potent probe of cosmology began with the discovery\nof the tiny variations in the temperature of the CMB by COBE-DMR in 1992. Over a period\nof 4 years, COBE-DMR took measurements of the full sky producing maps of the temperature\nfluctuations at 3 frequencies. The dipole contribution was removed and the galaxy was cut\nfrom the data to reveal a map of the CMB anisotropy signal. Variations on the spherical map\noccur on physical scales that can be expanded in spherical harmonics to get a power spectrum\nof temperature fluctuations (see Fig. 1). This is analogous to Fourier expanding a flat map.\nCOBE-DMR's large beam size meant it was not able to probe small scales (large multipoles).\nHowever, because it made observations over the whole sky, it was able to probe the largest\nscales (smallest multipoles). These scales are larger than the physical horizon at the time of\nrecombination, so perturbations on these scales have not been effected by interactions that occur\nduring and after decoupling. These perturbations therefore correspond to the initial density\nfluctuations that have seeded structure formation.\nA CMB photon that was last scattered from an over dense region will have to overcome\nthe gravitational attraction of that region in order to make its way towards us. As it does so,\n\n\fFigure 2: The current compilation of CMB data. The model plotted is the concordant cosmological model:\n\u03a9\u039b \u223c 0.72, \u03c9b \u223c 0.0226, \u03c9c \u223c 0.123, ns \u223c 0.96, \u03c4 \u223c 0.12 and h \u223c 0.72.\n\nFigure 3: The current compilation of CMB data binned to better visualise the fit of the concordance model.\n\nits wavelength is stretched, so over dense regions correspond to cold spots on the CMB map.\nSimilarly, the wavelength of a photon originating from an under dense will be compressed as\nit makes its way towards us, so hot spots correspond to under-densities. This physics was first\ndescribed in a 1967 paper by Sachs and Wolfe 4 . The region probed by COBE-DMR is therefore\nknown as the Sachs-Wolfe Plateau.\n2.2\n\nUnprecedented Precision\n\nThe most recent CMB data set to hit the headlines is WMAP, the Wilkinson Microwave\nAnisotropy Probe 5 . Scheduled to observe for 4 years, the first year results were announced\nin February 2003. Like COBE-DMR, WMAP is a differential experiment, measuring the temperature difference between two points in the sky rather than measuring absolute temperatures.\nThe team combined information from 5 frequency channels and filtered out the signal from our\ngalaxy in order to get a full sky map. You can see far more intricate detail when comparing this\nmap to the one from COBE-DMR.\nThe WMAP observations have 45 times the sensitivity and 33 times the angular resolution\n\n\fTable 1: 1\u03c3 cosmological parameter constraints on flat cosmologies from three analyses.\n\n\u03a9\u039b\n\u03c9b\n\u03c9c\nns\n\u03c4\nh\n\nWang et al.

Again, as it's a full sky map so probes the largest scales, the\nSachs-Wolfe Plateau, but due to its small beam size (\u223c 21\u2032 FWHM), it is also able to probe\nsmaller scales and the intricate physics that occurs during recombination and at later times.\nFig. 2 shows the angular power spectrum of temperature fluctuations from WMAP in its first\nyear of operation. The first year data sweeps over the first 2 peaks with unprecedented accuracy.\nThese peaks correspond to acoustic oscillations generated during recombination.\nFrom COBE-DMR's first measurement of the CMB anisotropy to WMAP's most recent\nobservations there have been hundreds of detections made over a range of scales by over 2 dozen\nautonomous and semi-autonomous groups. Fig. 2 shows the current compilation of CMB data.\nThis data can be used to gain information about our universe such as its matter content, its\nage and its geometry. It is difficult to visualise the fit of the cosmological model with so much\nscatter, so it is useful to bin the data (see Fig. 3). The model plotted in Figs. 2 and 3 is the\nconcordant cosmological model.\n2.3\n\nThe Concordant Cosmological Model\n\nAlthough the CMB has the potential to simultaneously constrain a number of cosmological\nparameters that are the ingredients of the hot big bang model, particular parameter combinations\ncan produce the same spectra. These model degeneracies limit our ability to extract parameters\nfrom the CMB alone. Combining information from a range of independent observational data\nsets enables certain degeneracies of the individual data sets to be resolved.\nWe are now beginning to refine an observationally concordant model; a model that is concordant to a number of data sets. Table 1 gives the results of a few of the most recent analyses.\nThe \u03c72 per degree of freedom for the fit of the concordant model (\u03a9\u039b \u223c 0.72, \u03c9b \u223c 0.0226,\n\u03c9c \u223c 0.123, ns \u223c 0.96, \u03c4 \u223c 0.12, h \u223c 0.72) to the full CMB anisotropy data set is 1.05 with a\n72% probabilty of finding a model that better fits the data 9 , indicating that the model provides\na good fit to the anisotropy data alone.\n3\n\nImplications for Inflation\n\nA key component of modern cosmologies is the assumption that the initial irregularities are generated by a period of inflation during the very early universe. The simplest inflationary models\npredict an approximately spatially flat universe, an approximately scale-invariant spectrum of\nGaussian, adiabatic primordial density perturbations and an approximately scale-invariant spectrum of gravitational waves with an amplitude that is a direct measure of Hubble rate during\ninflation.\n\n\f3.1\n\nSpatial Flatness\n\nFlatness is probed through the positions of the acoustic peaks. Before decoupling, the collapse\nof irregularities under gravity generates a radiation pressure gradient. This pressure gradient\nopposes the gravitational collapse, causing the primordial plasma to acoustically oscillate. The\nphase of the acoustic oscillation is imprinted on the photons as they last scatter producing the\nacoustic peaks in the angular power spectrum 10,2 . Odd peaks represent phases when the fluid\nin the potential wells is under compression and even peaks rarefaction phases.\nThe phase of the oscillation, and thus the positions of the acoustic peaks, depends on the\nmaximum distance a sound wave could have travelled since the Big Bang - the sound horizon.\nThe curvature of the universe affects the angle \u03b8s subtended today by the sound horizon at\nrecombination. If the subsequent journey of the CMB photons was not distorted by large-scale\ncosmic curvature, \u03b8s \u223c 1\u25e6 . The position of the first peak tells us that the largest CMB hot\nspots subtend an angle of about 1\u25e6 on the sky. In fact, the locations of the CMB acoustic peaks\nalone imply that the universe is approximately spatially flat and there is no improvement on\nthis prediction with the introduction of other data.\n3.2\n\nAdiabatic Initial Conditions\n\nThe two general classes of perturbations, adiabatic and isocurvature, drive acoustic oscillations\nthat are out of phase from each other. Adiabatic perturbations produce cosine harmonics and\nisocurvature sine. They can therefore be distinguished by taking the ratios of the locations of\nthe acoustic peaks 11 .\nAnalyses have shown that adiabatic models provide a good fit to the CMB data 7,8 . Although\nthere is no evidence for isocurvature in the CMB, constraints are weak if correlated modes are\nallowed 12 . However, several cosmological parameters for isocurvature models most favoured\nby the CMB conflict with other probes, e.g. the baryonic density \u03a9b is much higher than that\ninferred by light element abundances 12 .\n3.3\n\nGaussian Perturbations\n\nMeasurements of the amplitude of non-Gaussian primordial fluctuations are parameterised by a\nnonlinear coupling parameter, fNL . The simplest inflationary models predict |fNL | = 10\u22122 \u221210\u22121 .\nThe WMAP team tested their data for non-Gaussianity in two ways 13 . Firstly, constraints on\nfNL using the bispectrum gave fNL = 38 \u00b1 48 at 68% confidence. They also measured the\nmorphology of the maps using Minkowski Functionals, establishing the limit fNL = 22 \u00b1 81 at\n68% confidence.\nThe findings of the WMAP team reveal no evidence of primordial non-Gaussianity, allowing\nthem to conclude that their data is consistent with Gaussian primordial perturbations. However,\na number of investigations have shown the WMAP data to harbour statistically significant\ndepartures from rotational invariance 14 \u221219 . Whether these effects are primordial or systematic\ndue to instrument effects or imperfect foreground subtraction is yet unclear.\n3.4\n\nScale-Invariance\n\nAssuming a flat \u039bCDM model with a power-law spectrum of primordial scalar perturbations,\nthe CMB alone implies a close to scale-invariant spectrum in accordance with inflationary predictions 7 . Slow roll inflation predicts a small departure from a power-law spectrum, with a 2nd\norder running scalar index: dns /d ln k \u223c (ns \u2212 1)2 . The WMAP team reported weak evidence\nof running index by including small-scale data from the 2-degree Field Galaxy Redshift Survey\nand Ly\u03b1 forest observations 7 . Their analysis implies a much larger running than the slow roll\n\n\fFigure 4: Residuals of the observed band power anisotropies with respect to the concordant model plotted as a\nfunction of l. The line that best-fits the data is plotted (solid white line) and the 68% (dark grey region) and 95%\n(light grey region) confidence regions of the best-fit line are shaded. The concordant model is consistent with the\ndata although the high l data prefers a model with a slightly redder power-law spectrum, rendering the data on\nthe largest scales (l < 10) anomalously low.\n\nprediction, although modelling uncertainties in Ly\u03b1 forest data questions the reliability of this\nresult 21 .\nThe inclusion of the latest small-scale data such as VSA and CBI reveals a preference\n20 .\nfor slightly redder power-law spectra, e.g. ns = 0.96+0.06\n\u22120.03 combining VSA and WMAP\nFurthermore, analyses that include this interferometric data indicate a running in flat \u039bCDM\nmodels at the 2\u03c3 level. This reflects the fact that the data on the largest scales (l < 10)\nis anomalously low when tied to the latest small scale data (see Fig. 4 9 ). The evidence for\na running index is weakened considerably with inclusion of external priors from large-scale\nstructure data 8,20 . Future data on both large and small scales will further test departures from\na scale-invariant primordial spectrum of scalar perturbations.\nThe generation of a nearly scale-invariant background of gravitational waves is yet to be\nverified. Current CMB limits on the tensor-to-scalar ratio r are weak, e.g. r < 0.50 at 95%\nconfidence 8 . However, interesting constraints in the r \u2212 ns plane for specific inflationary models\nare already being made 8,22 . The ultimate goal of future CMB observations is to detect the\nB-mode polarisation signal that is predicted to be generated by tensor mode perturbations from\ngravitational waves. Such detections would give a direct measurement of the energy scale and\nplace tight constraints on the dynamics of inflation.\n4\n4.1\n\nProbing Reionisation and Dark Energy with the CMB\nPolarisation\n\nPolarisation is generated by the final Thomson scattering of the photons and therefore probes\nthe redshift dependence of the optical depth. Last scattering is expected to be concentrated\nin two distinct redshift bands: z \u223c 1100 (recombination) and below z \u223c 10 (reionisation). In\ntypical cosmological models the fraction of photons that rescattered at low redshift ranges from\na few percent to tens of percent.\nDetection of the CMB polarisation signal was first announced by the DASI team in 2002 23 .\nAssuming the concordant \u039bCDM model, they constrain both E- and B-mode spectra. Their\nanalysis reveals a 5\u03c3 detection of non-zero E-mode polarisation with an amplitude consistent\n\n\fFigure 5: The T-E cross-correlation signal from DASI and WMAP. The measurements on angular scales of about\n1/2 a degree (l \u223c 300) provide evidence for super horizon size adiabatic fluctuations existing on the surface of\nlast scattering at recombination.\n\nFigure 6: The WMAP data implies a significant excess power on large scales (l < 20) over the prediction assuming\npolarisation is only generated at recombination (dotted line). The solid line shows the concordant model.\n\nwith the expected central value (see Fig. 5). They report a T-E cross-correlation signal at 95%\nsignificance but find no evidence for B-mode polarisation.\nThe first year data release from the WMAP team includes detections of the T-E cross\ncorrelation spectrum (see Fig. 5). In accordance with the inflationary prediction, the WMAP\nmeasurements on angular scales of about 1/2 a degree (l \u223c 300) provide evidence for super\nhorizon size adiabatic fluctuations existing on the surface of last scattering at recombination.\nThey also find a significant excess power on large scales (l < 20) over the prediction assuming\npolarisation is only generated at recombination (see Fig. 6). Such an excess is consistent with\nan early epoch of reionisation (11 < zre < 30, \u03c4re = 0.17 \u00b1 0.04) which is hard to reconcile with\nthe significantly later epoch expected from quasar absorption spectra observations. This implies\na complex reionisation history.\n\n\f4.2\n\nCorrelations with Gravity Tracers\n\nWhen the universe becomes dominated by dark energy the gravitational potential decays, shifting the frequencies of photons passing though it. This local phenomenon generates the late-time\nintegrated Sachs-Wolfe effect that contributes to CMB power at the lowest multipoles. \u039bCDM\nmodels should therefore produce large-angle CMB anisotropies that are positively correlated\nwith matter fluctuations at z < 2, providing an independent check for dark energy 24 .\nThe WMAP team 25 cross-correlated their data with the NVSS radio source catalogue and\nfound \u039b > 0 with 95% confidence and \u039b = 0 rejected at the 3\u03c3 level. Boughn and Crittenden 26\ncross-correlated WMAP with data from the hard X-ray background, which is dominated by\nactive galaxy emission, and the NVSS survey. They report positive correlations at 3\u03c3 and 2.5\u03c3\nrespectively. Several groups have also detected the cross-correlation on large scales between\nWMAP and optical galaxy surveys 27,28 .\n\n5\n\nSummary\n\nPrecision cosmology has arrived. We are now able to probe the ingredients of the hot big bang\nmodel with unprecedented accuracy. Current ideas in cosmology appear to be vindicated. It\nseems we live in a dark energy dominated universe in which more than 80% of the matter content\nis in the form of exotic cold dark matter. The CMB data implies an almost spatially flat universe\nthat evolved from an approximately scale-invariant spectrum of Gaussian, adiabatic primordial\ndensity perturbations. This is to be expected if quantum fluctuations created in the very early\nuniverse were stretched to astronomical scales during an epoch of accelerated expansion known\nas cosmological inflation.\nAs we enter a new decade of CMB Observations, it is hoped that the issues raised by the\nWMAP first-year data such as the possible violation of rotational invariance and the implication\nof an early epoch of reionisation are tested. Efforts continue to map the full CMB sky to\nincreasing sensitivity. The second-year data release of WMAP is expected imminently and the\nPlanck Satellite, due for launch in 2007, intends to provide a full sky map of unprecedented\naccuracy and a cosmic-variance limited measurement of the power spectrum up to l \u223c 2000.\nWe can also expect more data at high l to high sensitivity. New ground based experiments\nsuch as ACT, APEX and SPT are in progress. Such small scale observations should provide further tests for departures from a power-law primordial spectrum and begin to explore secondary\nanisotropies such as the Sunyaev-Zeldovich and Ostriker-Vishniac effects.\nEfforts to constrain polarisation continue. BICEP, CAPMAP, Polarbear, QUAD and SPORT\nare applying new techniques to produce accurate measurements of E-mode polarisation and\nits temperature anisotropy correlations and there is already talk of a post-Planck satellite,\nCMBPOL, dedicated to CMB polarisation measurements. The ultimate goal remains to detect\nB-mode signal generated by tensor mode perturbations from gravitational waves. Such detections would give a direct measurement of the energy scale of inflation and place tight constraints\non the dynamics of inflation.\nWe can expect the CMB to continue to probe fundamental physics and cosmology for years\nto come. So far it has provided a very good determination of cosmological parameters but that\nisn't the same as understanding why. Why dark energy and dark matter? Why inflation? Why\nearly reionisation? Now that the cosmological uncertainties have been removed, the focus should\nturn to understanding the physics.\n\n\fAcknowledgments\nIt is a pleasure to thank Andrew Liddle and Charley Lineweaver for interesting discussions and\nuseful comments.
