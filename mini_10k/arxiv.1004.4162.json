Measurement-based quantum computation\nstarts from a highly entangled universal resource state. For years, clusters states\nhave been the only known universal resources. Surprisingly, a novel framework\nnamely quantum computation in correlation space has opened new routes to\nimplement measurement-based quantum computation based on quantum states\npossessing entanglement properties different from cluster states. Here we report\nan experimental demonstration of every building block of such a model. With a\nfour-qubit and a six-qubit state as distinct from cluster states, we have realized a\nuniversal set of single-qubit rotations, two-qubit entangling gates and further\nDeutsch's algorithm. Besides being of fundamental interest, our experiment\n\n\fproves in-principle the feasibility of universal measurement-based quantum\ncomputation without using cluster states, which represents a new approach\ntowards the realization of a quantum computer.\nMeasurement-based quantum computation (MQC), also called one-way\nquantum computation, has generated enormous interest in the quantum information\ncommunity since its discovery in 20011-3. In this computational model, two steps are\nrequired (i) preparing an algorithm-independent universal resource state and (ii)\nperforming single-qubit measurements with classical feed-forward of their outcomes.\nThe universal resources lie at the heart of measurement-based quantum computation.\nCluster states are the sole universal resources that people have been studying both\ntheoretically and experimentally1-9. Remarkably, it was found recently by Gross and\nEisert that, in the framework of MQC in correlation space many novel entangled\nstates can serve as universal resources for MQC, and singular entanglement properties\nof cluster states can be relaxed for a universal resource10-12. In this model, quantum\ninformation is stored and processed in a virtual system (i.e. the correlation space),\nwhich is mapped to the Hilbert space of physical particles by means of projection\nmeasurements.\n\nThe discovery has greatly enriched the universal resources for MQC. These\nnovel resource states offer more flexibility to implement quantum computation in\nvarious kinds of physical systems, e.g. optical systems, cold atoms and polar\nmolecules in optical lattices13, or many-body systems in condensed matter physics14.\nOne advantage for optical systems is that certain types of resource states can be\nefficiently prepared using controlled phase gates, the success probability of which\nincreases rapidly for smaller phase values at certain ranges15-17. Combined with the\nother techniques, e.g. integrated waveguides18-20, the working principles demonstrated\nhere may provide a new element towards a larger scale photonic quantum computing.\nFor optical lattice and condensed-matter systems, in contrast with cluster states, the\n\n\fsources of MQC in correlation space may arise as the natural ground states of a\nHamiltonian with only two-body interaction10-14, 21-24. The demonstration of MQC in\ncorrelation space will stimulate more interest in tailoring novel universal resource\nstates with the features of different physical systems.\n\nWith these novel universal resources, one can also gain new insights into the\nfundamental problem: what are the essential features of quantum states responsible\nfor the speedup of quantum computers over classical devices25-28? In MQC, the\ncomputational power is embedded in the universal resource states, entanglement\nproperties of which are thus believed to sustain the speedup of quantum computation.\nFor this reason, entanglement properties of cluster states appear to be paramount and\nfavourable for quantum computation, e.g.: two generic qubits are uncorrelated9, which\nmakes it possible to logically break down a large scale MQC into small components;\nand every particle is maximally entangled with the rest of the state in order to\nguarantee deterministic operations. Nevertheless, in contrast to cluster states,\nuniversal resource states with arbitrarily small local entanglement do exist, and a\nnon-vanishing correlation length as a matter of fact is not an obstacle for universal\nMQC10-12.\n\nIn this article we prepare such a new type of multi-photon entangled states\ndifferent from cluster states and demonstrate the working principles of MQC in\ncorrelation space. First, we generate a four-photon four-qubit state entangled with\npolarized photons to implement single qubit rotations and the strategy to compensate\nthe measurement randomness, which is a distinct feature of MQC in correlation space.\nFurthermore, a two-qubit entangling gate and Deutsch's algorithm are implemented\nbased on a four-photon six-qubit state entangled in both the polarization and spatial\nmodes. We show that the generated entangled states have entanglement properties\ndifferent from cluster states by measuring the two-point correlation functions and\nsingle-site entropy in the states, although they still satisfy the same entanglement\n\n\fcriteria for universality25, 28. Our results show that quantum states different from\ncluster states can also serve as promising candidates for one-way quantum\ncomputation, and fundamentally not all entanglement properties of cluster states are\nindispensable for quantum computation.\n\nTheoretical description of the resource states\nGeneral universal one-dimensional (1D) computational wires are expressed as\nmatrix product states (MPS)21, 29, 30\n\n\uf059 \uf03d \uf0e5 r A[ sn ] \uf0d7\uf0d7\uf0d7 A[ s1 ] l s1 \uf0d7\uf0d7\uf0d7 sn\n\n(1)\n\nsi\n\nwhere A[ si ] are single-qubit operators,\n\nl\n\nand\n\nr\n\nrepresent left and right\n\nboundary vectors in the so-called correlation space, which is the auxiliary\ntwo-dimensional vector space the matrices A[ si ] act on. A local projective\nmeasurement on site i with the outcome \uf066i\n\nwill induce the action of the operator\n\nA[ \uf066i ] \uf03d \uf0e5 \uf066i si A[ si ] in the correlation space, which can serve as the\nsi\n\ninitialization, single qubit rotation and readout of a logical qubit10-12. Quantum 1D\nwires can be coupled to form a two-dimensional (2D) resource state for the\nimplementation of entangling gates12.\n\nA four-qubit 1D MPS (see Fig. 1a) encoded on the polarized photons is used to\ndemonstrate single-qubit rotations. Here we take the left and right boundary vectors as\n\nl \uf03d \uf02b\n\nand r \uf03d 0 , where \uf02b \uf03d\n\n1\n( 0 \uf02b 1 ) . Moreover, for the first three sites\n2\n\nof the state, the tensor matrices are28\n\n\u02c6 \u02c6 sin \uf071 .\nA[ H ] \uf03d H\u02c6 cos \uf071 and A[ V ] \uf03d HZ\n\n(2)\n\n\fHere H\n\nand V\n\nthe qubits 0\n\ndenote the horizontal and vertical polarization, which represent\n\nand 1 ; \u0124 denotes the Hadamard gate and \u1e90 refers to the Pauli\n\nmatrix \uf073 z . For the end site, we adopt a simple alternative by changing the tensor\n\n\u02c6 \u02c6 . Substituting them into equation (1), the\nmatrix to B[ H ] \uf03d H\u02c6 , B[ V ] \uf03d HZ\nfour-qubit state is explicitly written as\n\n\uf079 4 \uf03d c H 1 (c H \uf02b s V )2 (c H P \uf02b s V M )34\n\uf02b s V 1 (c H \uf02d s V )2 (c H M \uf02b s V P )34\nwhere P \uf03d\n\n,\n\n(3)\n\n1\n1\n( H \uf02b V ) and M \uf03d\n( H \uf02d V ) . For simplicity, we denote\n2\n2\n\nc \uf03d cos\uf071 and s \uf03d sin \uf071 in the above equation and the following text. For any \uf071\n\nthat cos\uf071 \uf0b9 0 and sin \uf071 \uf0b9 0 , such a MPS can serve as a quantum wire for single\nqubit logic gates28. By tuning the parameter \uf071 , the entanglement properties can be\nvery different. In our experiment we choose the angle \uf071 as \uf070 / 6 , and thus\n\nc \uf03d 3 / 2 ; s \uf03d 1/ 2 . In this state, the processing of logical information is\nimplemented in the part of qubits with the tensor matrix A ; while the last site serves\nas readout and has the function of mapping the logical information carried by the\ncorrelation system to the physical qubit as 0 c \uf0ae P\n\np\n\nand 1 c \uf0ae M\n\n28\np\n\n.\n\nTo demonstrate the two-qubit entangling gate, a 2D resource state is required. As\nshown in Fig. 1b, our 2D state is constructed by coupling two 1D MPS (1-2-1' and\n3-3') with site 4 via a general scheme to construct universal resources from arbitrary\ncomputational wires (see Supplementary Information). The coupling is implemented\nby first preparing site 4 as P , and then applying two controlled-phase operations\nbetween qubits 2-4 and 3-4. We use the spatial degree of freedom u\n\nand d\n\nof\n\nphotons to carry the qubits 1' and 3'. The corresponding tensor matrices are\nrespectively\n\nB[ u 1\uf0a2 ] \uf03d B[ P\uf0a2 3\uf0a2 ] \uf03d H\u02c6\n\nand\n\n\u02c6 \u02c6 , where we\nB[ d 1\uf0a2 ] \uf03d B[ M \uf0a2 3\uf0a2 ] \uf03d HZ\n\n\fP\uf0a2 \uf03d\n\ndenote\n\n1\n1\n( u \uf02b d ) and M \uf0a2 \uf03d\n( u \uf02d d ) . The four-photon six-qubit\n2\n2\n\nstate is thus as follows\n\n\uf0796 \uf03d H\n\n4\n\n\uf06d\n\n121\uf0a2\n\n\uf06e\n\n33\uf0a2\n\n\uf02bV\n\n4\n\nZ\u02c62 \uf06d\n\n121\uf0a2\n\nZ\u02c63 \uf06e\n\n33\uf0a2\n\n,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere\n\n1\n2\n\n\uf06d \uf03d c2 HHu \uf02b cs VHu \uf02b cs VHd \uf02d s 2 VVd ; \uf06e \uf03d (c Hu \uf02b s Vd )\n\n(5)\n\nand Z\u02c6 i represents the Pauli matrix \uf073 z applied on qubit i .\n\nExperimental preparation of the resource states\nIn our experiment, entangled photons are created by using type-II parametric\ndown conversion31. Femto-second laser pulses ( \uf0bb 200 fs, 76 MHz, 788nm) are\nconverted to ultraviolet pulses through a frequency doubler LiB3O5 crystal and the\nultraviolet laser pulse passes through two nonlinear crystals (BBO), generating two\npairs of photons in path 1-2 and 3-4. The observed two-fold coincident count rate is\nabout 5.4 \uf0b4104 / s .\nFirst, let's consider the preparation of the four-qubit cluster state (see Fig. 2a). By\nplacing\n1\n(H\n2\n\nhalf-wave\n1\n\nP 2\uf02b V\n\n1\n\nplates,\n\nM 2)\n\nand\n\nwe\n\nprepare\n\n1\n(H\n2\n\n3\n\nthe\n\nP 4\uf02bV\n\n3\n\ninitial\n\ntwo-photon\n\nstates\n\nas\n\nM 4 ) . Then, two polarization\n\ndependent beam splitter cubes ( PBCa ) with Tv = (s/c)2 and Th = 1 are placed in paths\n2 and 3, where Tv (Th) represents the transmission probability for the vertical\n(horizontal) polarization. This will transform the entangled two-qubit states into\n\n1\n[ H 1 (c H \uf02b s V )2 \uf02b V 1 (c H \uf02d s V )2 ]\n2\n\n(6)\n\n\fand\n\n1\n(c H\n2\n\n3\n\nP 4 \uf02bsV\n\n3\n\nM 4 ) . According to the method in Ref. 32-37, we can\n\napply a C-phase gate between qubit 1 and 4 through a combination of PBCs , which\nincludes an overlapping PBCa (Tv=1/3 and Th=1), and a PBCb (Tv = 1 and Th = 1/3)\nin each path of 1 and 4. Note that the function of PBCb in path 1 is to adjust the\namplitude of H\n\n1\n\nand V 1 . By removing the PBCb in path, we can prepare\n\nexactly the state \uf079 4 .\nNext, let's consider the preparation of the six-qubit state \uf079 6\n\n(see Fig. 2b).\n\nBased on the created state \uf079 4 , we exchange the labels of the outputs 1 and 2. Then,\nwe let each of the photons 1 and 3 enter a polarization beam splitter ( PBS ). Since a\nPBS transmits H and reflects V polarization, H -polarized photons will follow\n\none path and V -polarized photons will follow the other. After post-selection, the\nfinal state will be converted to exactly \uf079 6\n\nif we denote the first path as u\n\ni'\n\nand\n\nthe latter path as d i ' , where i \uf03d 1,3 . In the experiment, the spatial qubits play the\nrole of reading out the results, and we need to measure the spatial qubits in the X, Y\nbases, which requires matching different spatial modes on a common beam splitter.\nWe have designed a special crystal combining a PBS and a beam splitter, and then\nwe have used Sagnac-ring interferometers38, 39 to construct the required single-photon\ninterferometers, which can be stable for about 10 hours.\n\nFor the four-qubit state, we have extracted its density matrix by the method of\nover-complete state tomography and obtained F \uf03d \uf079 4 \uf072 \uf079 4 \uf03d 0.74 \uf0b1 0.01 from the\ndensity matrix of the experimental state; for the six-qubit state, we have also\ncalculated its fidelity F \uf03d \uf079 6 \uf072 \uf079 6 \uf03d 0.73 \uf0b1 0.01 by measuring 36 measurement\nsettings in the local decomposition of \uf079 6 \uf079 6\n\n(see Supplementary Information for\n\nthe details). Furthermore, we verify that the entanglement properties of our resource\n\n\fstates are much different from cluster states by measuring both two-point correlations\nand local entanglement in the states. From Table I, we can conclude that, although the\nexperimental data is non-ideal, none of the tested two-point correlations equals zero\nand none of the local entropy equals 1, clearly showing that our states are not cluster\nstates.\n\nSingle-qubit rotations\nTo realize an arbitrary SU (2) single-qubit rotation, we measure the qubits of\nthe\n\nfour-qubit\n\nstate\n\n\uf07a\n\uf07a 0 \uf03d s H \uf02b i tca n\n\n2\n\n\uf0794\n\nin\n\nthe\n\nB(\uf07a ) \uf03d { \uf07a 0 , \uf07a 1 } ,\n\nbasis\n\nV and \uf07a 1 \uf03d c H \uf02d is cot\n\n\uf07a\n2\n\nwhere\n\nV . For simplicity, we define\n\nthe outcome rj to be 0 if the measurement result is \uf07a 0 , and as 1 if the result is\n\n\uf07a 1 . We first consider the case when all the measurement outcomes are 0. This will\nreduce the success probability of the gate for each step of measurement, but it suffices\nas a proof-of-principle to demonstrate the single-qubit gate. In each measurement\nstep, single qubit rotation Rz (\uf07a ) \uf03d exp(\uf02di\uf07a\uf073 z / 2) , followed by a Hadamard operation,\ncan be implemented. Based on the generated four-qubit state, we perform consecutive\nmeasurements B1 (\uf061 ) , B2 ( \uf062 ) , B3 (\uf067 ) on the physical qubits 1, 2, 3. By doing so,\nthe input state of the correlation system\n\uf079 out\n\nc\n\n\u02c6 (\uf067 ) R ( \uf062 ) R (\uf061 ) \uf02b\n\uf03d HR\nz\nx\ny\n\nwhere\n\n\uf079 in c \uf03d \uf02b\n\nis transformed into\n\nRx (\uf062 ) \uf03d exp(\uf02di\uf062\uf073 x / 2)\n\n(see\n\nFig.\n\n1a).\n\nFollowing the map induced by the tensor matrix B , the output state of the physical\nstate is\n\n\uf079 out\n\np\n\n\uf03d Rz (\uf067 ) Rx (\uf062 ) Ry (\uf061 ) \uf02b |0\uf0aeH ,1\uf0aeV . In Table. II, we show the\n\nexperimental fidelities of six states, the average of which is 0.86 \uf0b1 0.01 , clearly\nabove the classical threshold40 2/3. More results of the single-qubit gate can be found\nin the Supplementary Information.\n\n\fA distinct feature of MQC in correlation space is the strategy to compensate the\nrandomness of measurement outcomes. In cluster state quantum computation, the\nwrong measurement outcome only induces by-product Pauli operators, which can be\ncompensated by using feed-forward control of future measurement basis. The\nby-product operators in MQC in correlation space can be different from Pauli\nmatrices, and the simple feed-forward technique does not work in general any more.\nFortunately, it has been proved that the introduced errors can still be efficiently\ncorrected in a bounded number of steps with the trial-until-success strategy10-12.\n\nAs a proof-of-principle, we compare the success probability of implementing\n\n\u02c6 (\uf061 ) \uf02b with a two-qubit state \uf06c \uf03d c H\nthe rotation HR\n34\nz\n\n3\n\nP 4 \uf02bs V\n\n3\n\nM\n\n4\n\nand\n\nwith the four-qubit state \uf079 4 . Based on the two-qubit state, we measure qubit 1 in\nthe basis B(\uf061 ) . When the outcome r1 \uf03d 0 , we obtain the desired single-qubit\n\n\u02c6 (\uf061 ) \uf02b with a success probability p (\uf061 ) . However, when r \uf03d 1 , we\nrotation HR\nz\n1\ns\n\u02c6 (\uf061 \uf0a2) \uf02b but with a wrong angle tan(\uf061 \uf0a2 / 2) \uf03d \uf02d(1 3) \uf02a cot(\uf061 / 2) .\nobtain a rotation HR\nz\n\nBased on the four-qubit state, we first measure qubit 1 in the basis B(\uf061 ) . When\nobtaining r1 \uf03d 0 , we measure the qubits 2 and 3 in the Z basis, resulting an output\n\n\u02c6 (\uf061 ) \uf02b . When r \uf03d 1 , we measure the second qubit in the Z basis\nstate X\u02c6 r3 Z\u02c6 r2 HR\nz\n1\nwith the outcome r2 and the third qubit in the basis B[(-1)r2 (\uf061 \uf02d \uf061 ')] . When r3 \uf03d 0 ,\n\n\u02c6 (\uf061 ) \uf02b . The final\nwith a probability ps (\uf061 \uf02d \uf061 ') , we obtain the output state Z\u02c6 r2 HR\nz\nresult is equivalent to the desired rotation up to a Pauli by-product operator. Thus,\nwith two more qubits, we can boost the success probability of the rotation from\n\nps (\uf061 ) to ps (\uf061 ) \uf02b [1- ps (\uf061 )] \uf0d7 ps (\uf061 \uf02d \uf061 ') (see Supplementary Information for the\ncase of more qubits).\n\n\fThe experimental success probability in the four-qubit case is achieved by\nmeasuring in the appropriate basis and then adding the probability of each successful\nmeasurement branch. The theoretical and experimental success probabilities are\nshown in Fig. 3a, from which we can see that, the experimental data is well consistent\nwith the theoretical curve and the success probability has indeed been increased with\ncompensation.\n\nTwo-qubit entangling gates\nBesides single-qubit rotations, a two-qubit entangling gate is required to\ndemonstrate universal quantum computing. Based on the six-qubit state \uf079 6 , we\nhave realized a two-qubit controlled phase gate. We first measure qubit 1 in the basis\nB(\uf061 ) . When r1 \uf03d 0 (we only consider this case in the following text, the other\n\noutcome just corresponds to a different input), this measurement initializes the input\n\n\u02c6 (\uf061 ) \uf02b \uf0c4 \uf02b , where t and c denote the\nstate of the correlation system as HR\nz\nt\nc\ntarget and control logical qubit corresponding to two computational wires (1-2-1' and\n3-3'). Then, we measure qubit 2 and 3 in the basis B(\uf070 ) \uf03d {s H \uf02b ic V , c H \uf02d is V } .\n2\n\n(a) Once having the outcome r2 \uf03d r3 \uf03d 0 , we measure qubit 4 in the Y basis\n\n{ H \uf02b i V , H \uf02d i V } and transform the logical state carried by the correlation\nsystems from\n\n\u02c6 (\uf061 ) \uf02b \uf0c4 \uf02b\n\uf079 in \uf03d HR\nz\nt\n\nc\n\nto \uf079 out \uf03d ( H\u02c6 \uf0c4 H\u02c6 ) \uf0d7 (Z\u02c6 \uf0c4 Z\u02c6 )r4 \uf0d7 CZ \uf079 in ,\n\nwhere CZ \uf03d I \uf0c4 0 0 \uf02b Z\u02c6 \uf0c4 1 1 is the controlled phase gate. The tensor matrices\ncorresponding to qubits 1' and 3' map the logical output state to the physical output\nstate28 carried by qubits 1' and 3' as\n\n( I \uf0c4 H\u02c6 ) \uf0d7 ( Z\u02c61' \uf0c4 Z\u02c63' )r4 \uf0d7 ( 0 \uf02b \uf02d i tan\n\n\uf061\n2\n\n1 \uf02d )1'3' |0\uf0aeu ,1\uf0aed .\n\n(8)\n\n\f(b) If r2 \uf0b9 0 or r3 \uf0b9 0 , we measure qubit 4 in the Z basis and decouple two 1D\nwires. After the measurement, a local rotation error will appear on each logical qubit.\nThe same as in the single-qubit gate, we can efficiently correct them by applying the\ntrial-until-success strategy if we have more qubits.\nIn the experiment, when r2 \uf03d r3 \uf03d 0 , we characterize the output state of the\ntwo-qubit gate by the method of state tomography. We collect the experimental data\nfor\n\n600s\n\nfor\n\neach\n\nof\n\n36\n\ncombinations\n\nof\n\nthe\n\nmeasurement\n\nbasis\n\n{ H \uf0a2 , V \uf0a2 , P\uf0a2 , M \uf0a2 , R\uf0a2 , L\uf0a2 } , where R\uf0a2 \uf03d 1 ( u \uf02b i d ) and L\uf0a2 \uf03d 1 ( u \uf02d i d ) , and\n2\n2\n\nthen estimate the density matrix with the maximum likelihood technique. The\ntheoretical and experimental density matrices of physical output states when\n\n\uf061 \uf03d 0,r4 \uf03d 0 and \uf061 \uf03d \uf070 / 3,r4 \uf03d 0 are shown in Fig. 3. The states are in good\nagreement with the ideal states, which can be seen from their fidelities: 0.88 \uf0b1 0.02\nand 0.84 \uf0b1 0.03 . More data when r2 \uf03d r3 \uf03d 0 and the detailed fidelities when r2 \uf0b9 0\nor r3 \uf0b9 0 are shown in the Supplementary Information.\n\nDeutsch's algorithm\n\nDeutsch's algorithm represents an interesting instance of demonstrating the\npower of quantum computation over classical computation41,\n\n42\n\n. Here we\n\nexperimentally demonstrate the implementation of Deutsch's algorithm based on the\nsix-qubit state \uf079 6 . Deutsch's algorithm, also known as the Deutsch-Jozsa\nalgorithm43, allows one to distinguish two different types of function\n\nf ( x)\n\nimplemented by an oracle in a black box. The function f ( x) with an N -bit binary\ninput x is constant if it returns the same value (either 0 or 1) for all possible inputs\nand balanced if it returns 0 for half of the inputs and 1 for the other half. With\n\n\fclassical methods, in some cases we have to query this oracle as many as 2N \uf02d1 \uf02b 1\ntimes. However, only one query is required in all cases by using quantum\ncomputation43. In the two-qubit version, the applied algorithm can be demonstrated as\n\nx y \uf0ae x y \uf0c5 f ( x) , where x\ninput qubit. Preparing\n\nx y\n\nis the query input qubit and\nas\n\ny\n\nis the ancilla\n\n\uf02b \uf02d , we can get the output states\n\n[(\uf02d1) f (0) 0 \uf02b (\uf02d1) f (1) 1 ] \uf02d . Finally, we apply two Hadamard operations on the two\noutput qubits. If f ( x) is constant, the final result will be H V , while if it is\nbalanced, the final result will be V V . Therefore, now we can determine the types\nof f ( x) from the output states. There are two types of constant function, namely\n\nf1 \uf03d I \uf0c4 I and f 2 \uf03d I \uf0c4 \uf073 x . Also, there are two types of balanced function, namely\nf3 \uf03d gcnot and\nSince\n\nf 4 \uf03d gcnot ( I \uf0c4 \uf073 x ) , where g cnot represents a controlled-not gate.\n\nf 2 and\n\nf 4 can be achieved from\n\nf1 and\n\nf 3 by single-qubit local\n\noperations, in the following we consider only the functions f1 and f 3 .\n\nIn the experiment, we use the wire 3-3' of \uf079 6\nand 1-2-1' of \uf079 6\n\nto carry the query logical qubit\n\nfor the ancilla logical qubit. In the following, we consider the\n\nimplementation of Deutsch's algorithm when r1 \uf03d r2 \uf03d r3 \uf03d r4 \uf03d 0 . The measurement\nof qubit 1 in the basis B(\uf070 ) and qubits 2, 3, 4 in the basis B(0) performs the\ntransformation H q \uf0c4 Rz (\uf070 )a . Moreover, considering the map of logical qubits from\ncorrelation systems into the physical qubits the final transformation of the inputs will\nbe ( H\u02c6 q \uf0c4 H\u02c6 a )( I q \uf0c4 Rz (\uf070 )a ) , which implements the preparation of ancilla qubit \uf02d ,\nthe constant function and the readout of the qubits (see Fig. 4a). Similarly, by\nmeasuring qubit 1 in the basis B(\uf070 ) and qubits 2, 3, 4 in the basis B(\uf070 / 2) , we can\nimplement the gate ( H\u02c6 q \uf0c4 H\u02c6 a ) gcnot ( I q \uf0c4 Rz (\uf070 )a ) on the inputs, which is the case\n\n\fwhen the function is balanced (see Fig. 4b). Here the measurement of qubits 2, 3 and\n4, together with the detector signal corresponding to r1 \uf03d r2 \uf03d r3 \uf03d r4 \uf03d 0 should be\nviewed as the entire black box. In the experiment, the success probability of\nrecognizing the type of f ( x) is as large as 99% \uf0b1 1% for f1 and 75% \uf0b1 2% for\nf 3 . The non-ideal probability is mainly caused by the non-perfect resource state and\n\nsingle-photon interferometers in the setup. In the Supplementary Information, we\nhave discussed in detail the cases when some measurement outcomes are not zero.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThere are many open questions, both theoretical and experimental, worth\ninvestigating in the future. In MQC with cluster states, efficient linear optical\nquantum computation is possible with detector efficiency above 1/2 and arbitrary\nsmall source efficiency44, 45. With novel resource states for quantum computation in\ncorrelation space, computation will probably require more qubits. Nevertheless, it has\nbeen proved that bonds between two particles can be easier to create if the required\nentanglement is below certain levels15-17, which is related to the resource\nrequirements44-46. It would be interesting to investigate what conditions are required to\nmake the latter scheme scalable. Moreover, in our experiment we have used the\nspatial modes of photons as read-out qubits in the two-qubit entangling gate. It is\nuseful to grow a larger resource state this way; however, in the current setup, the\nspatial qubit is limited to connect the polarization qubit of the same photon only.\nMore scalable ways of hyper-entanglement should be investigated. Third, the future\nimplementations of photonic quantum computer will likely require integrated\nwaveguides18-20. The pioneering works of integrated waveguides including\nultra-stable interferometer18,\n\n19\n\nand precise optical phase control20 have been\n\ndemonstrated. The combination of the present scheme with integrated waveguides\nwill further advance the development of optics quantum computing. Finally, the\n\n\ffeed-forward rule also warrants further study, and it would be desirable to combine\nthe feed-forward technique8, 47 with the proof-of-principle demonstration.\n\nReferences\n1.

A\nfour-qubit state for the implementation of single qubit rotations.

The measurements on the first three qubits will implement the\nB[ V ] \uf03d HZ\nquantum circuit on the right. b. A six-qubit state for the implementation of a\ntwo-qubit entangling gate. The horizontal lines (1-2-1' and 3-3' ) represent two\ncomputational wires corresponding to two logical qubits. To couple them, we\nprepare site 4 as\n\n1\n( H \uf02b V ) and then apply two controlled-Z operations\n2\n\non qubits 2-4 and 3-4. The measurements on the qubits 1-2-3-4 will implement\na C-Phase gate shown on the right. The Z\u02c6 \uf0c4 Z\u02c6 operation will depend on the\nmeasurement result of qubit 4, and thus they are drawn in dashed squares.\n\n\f\fFigure 2: Experimental setup for the generation of the four-qubit state\n\n\uf0794\n\nand the six-qubit state \uf079 6 . a. An ultra-violet pulse passes through\n\ntwo BBO crystals to create two pairs of entangled photons. Then, half-wave\nplates (HWP) and a series of polarization dependent beam splitter cubes\n(PBCs) have been used to create the desired state. Prism \uf044d1 is used to\nensure that the input photons arrive at the PBCs at the same time.\nFurthermore, every output is spectrally filtered ( \uf044\uf06cFWHM \uf03d 3.2nm ) to ensure\ngood temporal overlap. A combination of HWP, quarter-wave plates (QWP)\nand polarization beam splitter (PBS) has been used to implement the\nmeasurement setups. b. By exchanging the labels of 1 and 2 of \uf079 4 , and\nletting the photons 1 and 3 enter two PBSs, the desired six-qubit state \uf079 6\ncan be prepared. The ultra-stable Sagnac-ring interferometers have been used\nto measure the spatial qubits. In the interferometer, the specially designed\nbeam-splitter cubes are half PBS-coated and half beam splitter coated and\nhigh-precision small-angle prisms are used to satisfy fine adjustments of the\nrelatively delay of the two different paths.\n\n\fFigure 3: The success probability single-qubit rotation and the density matrices\nof the output states of the entangling two-qubit gate. a. The theoretical and\nexperimental success probability of single-qubit rotation with and without\ncompensation of the rotation error. The blue (red) line represents the\ntheoretical success probability under the white noise model in the two-qubit\n(four-qubit)\n\ncase.\n\nHere\n\nthe\n\ntwo\n\nstates\n\nare\n\nwritten\n\nas\n\n\uf0722 \uf03d p \uf06c34 \uf06c34 \uf02b (1 \uf02d p) I 2 / 4 and \uf0724 \uf03d p\uf0a2 \uf079 4 \uf079 4 \uf02b (1 \uf02d p\uf0a2) I 4 /16 , where I 2 ( I 4 )\ndenotes\n\ntwo-qubit\n\n(four-qubit)\n\nidentity\n\nmatrix;\n\np \uf03d (4 f 2 -1) / 3\n\n;\n\np\uf0a2 \uf03d (16 f 4 \uf02d 1) /15 and f 2 ( f 4 ) is the fidelity of the two-qubit (four-qubit) state,\nthat is, 0.90 (0.73). The blue (red) dots represent the experimental values in\nthe two-qubit (four-qubit) case, which are achieved by measuring the states for\n5s (300s). From the figure, we can see that the success probability has been\nenhanced by using two more qubits. b. c. The density matrices of the output\nstates of the entangling two-qubit gate. The left column shows the real and the\n\n\fimaginary part of the experimental output state density matrices, while the right\ncolumn shows the theoretical density matrices. In cases b and c, qubit 1 is\nrespectively measured in bases B(0) and B(\uf070 / 3) . All the matrices are\nachieved in the case when the outcome of the measurements is\n\nr1 \uf03d r2 \uf03d r3 \uf03d r4 \uf03d 0 .\n\nFigure 4: The theoretical design and the experimental results of\nimplementing Deutsch's algorithm. The wire 3-3' represents the query\nlogical qubit, and the wire 1-2-1' represents the ancilla logical qubit. In a and b,\nthe measurement patterns on the physical qubits (left) implement the algorithm\non the logical qubits (right). The angles \uf061 represent the measurement basis\n\nB(\uf061 ) of each physical qubit. In the circuit, the operation ( I \uf0c4 H\u02c6 ) represents\n\n\fthe mapping of the qubits from the correlation space to the realistic physical\nworld. The final results are carried by the qubits 3' and 1'. The success\nprobability of recognizing the constant function is 99% \uf0b1 1% , while for the\nbalanced function, this probability is 75% \uf0b1 2% .\n\n\f"}
