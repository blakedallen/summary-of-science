To date, most\nof the effort has focused on the iron K\u03b1 emission line, predicted to show a relativistically\nbroadened profile (Fabian et al. 1989; Laor 1991), which appeared to be common among\nSeyfert 1 galaxies, as observed by ASCA (Tanaka et al. 1995; Nandra et al. 1997). However\nthe situation emerging from the newer XMM-Newton and Chandra data is more ambiguous, the spectra showing that narrower (non-relativistic) lines are commonplace (Yaqoob &\nPadmanabhan 2004). Indeed the red-wing of the broad iron line is often hard to distinguish\nfrom the effects of the warm absorber (Reeves et al. 2004; Turner et al. 2005a).\nGiven the ambiguity in modeling the broad iron line, additional diagnostics of the inner\ndisk material are needed. Narrow, transient and redshifted iron emission lines of modest\nstatistical significance have recently been claimed in several AGN (Turner et al. 2002; Dovciak\net al. 2004; Porquet et al. 2004) possibly originating from local hot-spots on the disk surface.\nPotentially these lines can be tracked to reveal orbital motions in the inner disk (Dovciak\net al. 2004; Turner et al. 2005b). However little evidence has been found to date for infall\nof matter onto the black hole. In this paper, we present evidence of highly redshifted iron\nK\u03b1 absorption lines in the narrow-line Seyfert 1, PG 1211+143 with Chandra LETG. This\nmay either be interpreted as infall onto the massive black hole, or gravitational redshift\noccurring within < 6Rg of a Kerr black hole. PG 1211+143 (at z=0.0809) is a prototypical\n'Big Blue Bump' quasar, and one of the brightest AGN in the soft X-ray band (Walter\n& Fink 1993). A previous XMM-Newton observation of PG 1211+143 showed blue-shifted\nabsorption from a high velocity (v \u223c 0.1c) outflow (Pounds et al. 2003). The soft X-ray\nproperties of PG 1211+143, which confirm the blue-shifted absorber, will be presented in a\nsubsequent paper. Values of H0 =70 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 , q0 =0.0 and \u039b0 = 0.73 are assumed and\nerrors are quoted at 90% confidence (\u2206\u03c72 = 2.7), for 1 parameter of interest.\n\n2.\n\nChandra and XMM-Newton Observations of PG 1211+143\n\nPG 1211+143 was observed by Chandra with the Low Energy Transmission Grating\n(LETG) in 3 consecutive orbits between 21 June 2004 and 26 June 2004 of approximately\n45 ks exposure per orbit (see Table 1). An XMM-Newton observation was conducted simultaneously with the first Chandra orbit, but due to high and variable background, this\nwas reduced to only \u223c20 ks useful exposure. The ACIS-S detector was used on the focal\nplane, with the S3 chip being at the telescope aimpoint. Chandra LETG source spectra,\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nbackground spectra and response matrices were generated using CIAO 3.2.1. Streaks were\nremoved from the ACIS-S CCD array, while events with grades 0, 2, 3, 4, and 6 were selected. After screening an exposure of 133.6 ks was obtained. Spectra and responses from\nthe \u00b11 orders were extracted and combined to maximize signal to noise. The time-averaged\ncombined first order LETG count rate was 0.31 counts s\u22121 . Data from the zeroth order\nimage were not used, due to photon pile-up. The 1st order spectra were binned so that one\nbin represents the FWHM resolution of the LETG (\u2206\u03bb = 0.05), ensuring sufficient counts\nper bin to use the \u03c72 minimization spectral fitting technique.\n\n3.\n\nLETG Spectral Analysis\n\nTo parameterize the X-ray continuum, the LETG spectrum was fitted with a broken\npower-law model, modified by neutral Galactic absorption of NH = 2.8 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22122 (Dickey\n& Lockman 1990), over the 0.4-8.0 keV bandpass. The soft and hard X-ray photon indices,\nbreak energy and model normalization were allowed to vary; the best fit values are \u0393soft =\n2.77 \u00b1 0.03, \u0393hard = 1.96 \u00b1 0.05, break energy E = 1.7 \u00b1 0.1 keV and normalized flux of 1.6 \u00b1\n0.1\u00d710\u22123 photons keV\u22121 cm\u22122 s\u22121 (at 1 keV). The integrated flux is 1.42\u00d710\u221211 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121\n(0.4-8 keV), corresponding to an unabsorbed X-ray luminosity of 2\u00d71044 erg s\u22121 . The spectral\nfit obtained is formally unacceptable, with \u03c72 /dof = 686/544 (dof=degrees of freedom) for\na rejection probability of 2.9 \u00d7 10\u22125 . This is due to several ionized emission and absorption\nlines (e.g. from O, Ne) below 1 keV, although the continuum is fitted well above 2 keV. A\nsubsequent paper will describe the soft X-ray spectrum of PG 1211+143 obtained with the\nLETG (Reeves et al. 2005, in preparation).\nIn this paper we concentrate on the spectrum in the iron K band above 2 keV. A\nsingle power-law model provides an adequate fit to the continuum above 2 keV, with a\nphoton index of \u0393 = 1.99 \u00b1 0.06. The fit statistic obtained is \u03c72 /dof = 116.4/93, which is\nmarginally acceptable (the rejection probability is 5\u00d710\u22122 ). Figure 1 shows the LETG counts\nspectrum above 2 keV, the lower panel showing the \u03c72 residuals of the data compared to\nthe continuum model. Each bin represents the FWHM resolution of the LETG. Two strong\nnegative deviations that contribute significantly towards the total \u03c72 are observed near 4.2\nand 4.9 keV, due to two absorption lines in the PG 1211+143 spectrum. To test this, two\nunresolved (\u03c3 = 10 eV) Gaussian absorption lines were added to the continuum model. A\nsignificant improvement in the spectral fit was obtained (\u03c72 /dof = 83.4/89), with addition of\ntwo absorption lines at 4.22 \u00b1 0.03 keV and 4.93 \u00b1 0.03 keV (observed frame) with equivalent\nwidths of 35 \u00b1 16 eV and 57 \u00b1 23 eV. The improvement in fit statistic upon adding each line\nwas \u2206\u03c72 = 13.8 and \u2206\u03c72 = 19.9 respectively, while the overall fit statistic is now acceptable.\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nTo constrain the width of the two absorption lines, the LETG spectrum was rebinned to\ntheir maximum resolution, with each bin representing 1/4 FWHM resolution of the LETG\n(\u2206\u03bb = 0.0125 \u00c5 or \u2206E = 16 eV at 4 keV). The rest-frame spectrum at this resolution\nnear the absorption lines is shown in Figure 2. The spectral fit was minimized using the Cstatistic (Cash 1979), due to the lower number of counts per bin at this resolution. The best\nfit width is \u03c3 \u223c 21 eV (at 4.9 keV), corresponding to a FWHM velocity of \u223c 3000 km s\u22121 .\nHowever the line width is poorly constrained, the 90% upper limit being < 7800 km s\u22121 .\nThe variability of the absorption lines was tested by comparing the LETG spectra across\nall three Chandra orbits. The first LETG orbit was simultaneous with XMM-Newton, so\nthe LETG and EPIC-pn spectra were fitted jointly. The results are shown in Table 1, while\nthe C-statistic was used to minimize the spectral fits. The 4.2 and 4.9 keV lines are only\nformally detected during the 2nd orbit, although orbits 2 and 3 are statistically consistent.\nThe lines do appear to vary in equivalent width between orbits 1 and 2 at > 90% confidence.\n\n3.1.\n\nStatistical Significance of the Absorption Lines\n\nIn order to check that the absorption is not due to calibration effects, the PG 1211+143\nspectrum was compared to all the archived LETG observations of 3C 273. No residuals\nare present in the summed or individual 3C 273 spectra near the line energies 4.22 keV and\n4.93 keV (Figure 3). The limit on the equivalent width of any absorption lines is < 4 eV in the\nsummed spectrum. The source and background spectral extraction regions of PG 1211+143,\nin each of the three Chandra orbits, were also inspected. No anomalous pixels or rows were\nobserved in the CCD array and no background sources were present within the extraction\nregions. The separate \u00b11 order spectra of PG 1211+143 were also found to be consistent.\nThus the lines are not due to systematic or calibration effects in the LETG.\nIn order to assess the statistical significance of the lines, we wish to determine the\nchance probability of falsely detecting two lines, over an energy band of interest. In order to\nestimate this, 1000 LETG spectra were simulated, under the null hypothesis assumption that\nthe spectrum consists of a broken power-law continuum from 0.4-8.0 keV, with no spectral\nlines. The distribution of \u2206\u03c72 values obtained by fitting a single Gaussian line to each\nof the 1000 spectra simulated in the null hypothesis case can then be compared to the\nmeasured \u2206\u03c72 in the real dataset to calculate the false probability of detection (Porquet et\nal. 2004). The 1st order LETG spectra were simulated using identical continuum parameters\nand exposure as in the real PG 1211+143 dataset and binned at the FWHM resolution of the\nLETG. A single narrow Gaussian line (either in absorption or emission) was added to the\ncontinuum model and then fitted to each simulated spectrum. The line energy was stepped in\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nincrements of one FWHM resolution bin over the 3\u20137 keV band and the simulated spectrum\nwas re-fitted at each increment to minimize \u03c72 . The minimum \u03c72 obtained from adding the\nline to the spectral fit was compared to the \u03c72 obtained for the continuum model alone for\neach spectrum, in order to compute the distribution of \u2206\u03c72 versus probability for all 1000\nsimulated spectra. The 3\u20137 keV band was chosen for the line search as it is most likely that\na strong iron K\u03b1 line will be observed over this energy range; i.e. < 3 keV is outside the iron\nK band-pass for any feasible redshift, while the LETG has little effective area above 7 keV.\nThe improvement in fit statistic obtained for adding the two lines to the actual dataset was\n\u2206\u03c72 = 13.8 and \u2206\u03c72 = 19.9 for each line. The simulations show that the false probability\nof detecting a line with equal or greater \u2206\u03c72 is 0.034 and 0.004 for the 4.2 and 4.9 keV\nlines respectively. The probability of both lines being false detections is the product of these\nprobabilities, which is 1.36 \u00d7 10\u22124 .\nAs an independent check, we calculate the line significances using the actual errors on\nthe fitted parameters. The absorption line fluxes at 4.2 and 4.9 keV are \u2212(4.9 \u00b1 1.3) \u00d7\n10\u22126 photons cm\u22122 s\u22121 and \u2212(5.9 \u00b1 1.5) \u00d7 10\u22126 photons cm\u22122 s\u22121 respectively, while the continuum fluxes at these energies are 1.40 \u00b1 0.10 \u00d7 10\u22124 photons cm\u22122 s\u22121 keV\u22121 and 1.04 \u00b1\n0.08 \u00d7 10\u22124 photons cm\u22122 s\u22121 keV\u22121 . The equivalent widths of the lines are then \u221235 \u00b1 10 eV\nand \u221257 \u00b1 15 eV respectively. The errors are 1\u03c3 values and the line flux and continuum\nerrors have been propogated. Thus the two absorption lines are significant at 3.5\u03c3 and 3.8\u03c3,\nwith corresponding null probabilities of 4.6 \u00d7 10\u22124 and 1.4 \u00d7 10\u22124 . However these are single\ntrial probabilities for a line at an a-priori known energy. Taking into account the number of\nbins N searched for line features in the 3-7 keV range, then the null detection probability P\nwill be P = 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 P1 )N , where P1 is the single trial probability from above. As there are\n48 resolution bins in the 3-7 keV range, the null probabilities for the 4.2 and 4.9 keV lines\nare 0.022 and 0.0067 respectively, in excellent agreement with the Monte-Carlo estimates.\n\n4.\n\nDiscussion\n\nTwo absorption lines are observed at 4.22 and 4.93 keV in the PG 1211+143 LETG\nspectrum, with a low probability that both are false detections. Although the lines are\nlikely to be associated with redshifted Fe K\u03b1, we first consider whether the lines could\noriginate from other elements at lower velocities. The absorption line rest frame energies are\n4.56 \u00b1 0.03 keV and 5.33 \u00b1 0.03 keV. The closest transitions to those energies are Sc xxi K\u03b1\n(at 4.53 keV) or V xxiii (5.43 keV) respectively. The abundances of Sc or V are extremely\nlow, \u223c 1000\u00d7 less than Fe. Even if the abundances of were enhanced through spallation\nof iron nuclei by energetic protons on the disk surface (Skibo 1997), the strengths of these\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nlines would still be considerably weaker (<< 10%) than due to Fe K\u03b1. One other possibility\nis that the absorption originates from lower Z elements such as Si, S or Ca in a relativistic\noutflow. Blue-shifted lines with v \u223c 0.1c have been detected in PG 1211+143 in a previous\nXMM-Newton observation by Pounds et al. (2003). In this case Ca xx at 4.10 keV would\nappear the most reasonable identification for the lower energy line, requiring an outflow\nvelocity of 32000 km s\u22121 . However the Ca xx line is still likely to be weak, as the abundance\nratio is Fe/Ca \u223c 20 (Anders & Grevesse 1989). Si or S are more abundant than Ca, however\nif the lines originate from Si xiv K\u03b1 and S xvi K\u03b1, then the outflow velocities are 0.68c and\n0.62c respectively. The kinetic power of such a fast flow would be a factor of \u223c 40 greater\nthan calculated by Pounds et al. (2003), probably exceeding 1046 erg s\u22121 and the bolometric\noutput of the quasar. Such a highly energetic flow seems implausible, unless the opening\nangle of the outflow is small.\nThe most likely scenario is that the lines originate from highly redshifted iron K\u03b1.\nIndeed there have been a small number of previous claims of redshifted Fe K absorption lines\nin other AGN. Nandra et al. (1999) first claimed the possibility of redshifted iron K-shell\nabsorption, through ASCA observations of the Seyfert 1 NGC 3516. However recent Chandra\nand XMM-Newton observations (Turner et al. 2002) have showed that this is probably due\nto a strong narrow K\u03b1 core at 6.4 keV and variable emission lines at < 6.4 keV. Other\nclaimed examples include a 6.2 keV line in the quasar 1E 1821+643 with Chandra HETG\n(Yaqoob & Serlemitsos 2005) and a weak redshifted line in the quasar Q 0056-363 (Matt et\nal. 2005). Most recently the detection of transient redshifted Fe absorption lines in Mrk 509\nwas claimed in Beppo-SAX data, with a velocity shift of v = 0.21c (Dadina et al. 2005).\nIf the lines in PG 1211+143 correspond to H-like iron (i.e. Fe xxvi K\u03b1 at 6.97 keV)\nthen the redshifted velocities are 0.26c and 0.40c, while if the lines correspond to He-like\niron (Fe xxv K\u03b1 resonance at 6.70 keV), the velocities are 0.22c and 0.37c. Note that the\nseparation of the two lines requires two distinct velocity components, as the higher order\nFe K\u03b2 lines are undetectable in this spectrum. It is unlikely that the lines result from a\nlower ionization than Fe xxv, as then a series of strong L-shell Fe lines and edges would be\ndetected at lower energies, which is not the case. Furthermore the absorption lines cannot\nbe from near neutral Fe (Fe i-xvii) at 6.4 keV, because no strong K\u03b1 absorption line would\nbe observed, as the L-shell would be fully populated.\nThe two possible causes for the relativistic shifts are either gravitational redshift of\nphotons near the massive black hole or infall of matter onto the black hole. In the former\nscenario, the absorbing matter would have to be located at 3.5 \u00b1 0.5Rg and 4.8 \u00b1 0.5Rg\nrespectively from a Schwarzschild black hole (where Rg = GM/c2 is one gravitational radius).\nThis is within the last stable orbit around a Schwarzschild black hole and requires a Kerr\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nmetric (Thorne 1974) for the matter to exist in a stable orbit within 6Rg . For a maximal poleon Kerr black hole, the radii derived are then 3.2Rg and 4.6Rg respectively. Alternatively,\nthe matter may be infalling onto the black hole, in which case a maximum velocity of \u223c 0.38c\n(in the frame of the observer) can be achieved at 6Rg for a Schwarzschild metric.\nModeling the two absorption line systems with Xstar (Kallman et al. 1996), requires a\n23\nlarge column density of NH = 4.0+3.7\ncm\u22122 (assuming a turbulence of \u03c3v = 1000 km s\u22121\n\u22121.9 \u00d710\nand solar abundances). The ionization parameter is log \u03be = 3.9\u00b10.3 erg cm s\u22121 , with most of\nthe absorption arising from Fe xxvi K\u03b1. The equivalent column density of Fe xxvi is \u223c 7 \u00d7\n1018 cm\u22122 , while the optical depth at the K-shell edge is \u03c4 < 0.1, i.e. the matter is opticallythin to the continuum. The velocity of the two absorption systems are v = (0.28 \u00b1 0.01)c\nand v = (0.42 \u00b1 0.01)c, while the line of sight covering fraction is > 50%. From the above\nparameters we can derive the physical properties of the gas. A black hole mass of 4\u00d7107 M\u2299\nis assumed (Kaspi et al. 2000), an ionizing luminosity of L \u223c 1044 erg s\u22121 and a radial distance\nof R \u223c 1014 cm (i.e. a few Rg ). The ionization parameter is defined as \u03be = L/nR2 (n is the\nelectron density), while one can define a filling factor f as f = \u2206R/R = NH /nR. A density\nof n \u223c 1012 cm\u22123 is calculated, with a filling factor of \u223c1% and a cloud size of \u223c 1012 cm.\nNote that these should be considered order of magnitude estimates, due to the uncertainties\nin R and black hole mass. The matter may be clumped, perhaps from density perturbations\non the disk or from localized filaments within the infalling matter.\nA fast outflow of \u223c 0.1c has already been detected in an earlier XMM-Newton observation of PG 1211+143 (Pounds et al. 2003) which is confirmed from the analysis of the soft\nX-ray LETG data (Reeves et al. 2005, in preparation). One possibility is that part of this\noutflow does not escape the gravitational potential of the black hole (Murray & Chiang 1998;\nProga, Stone, & Kallman 2000). If material is launched with v = 0.1c in PG 1211+143, then\nmatter within a radius of R < 100Rg may not escape the system. Thus it is possible to\nproduce both red and blue-shifted lines in PG 1211+143, indeed in Mrk 509 both inflow and\noutflow also appear to be present (Dadina et al. 2005). From above, the mass infall rate\nrequired is \u1e40 \u223c \u03c0f nR2 vmp \u223c \u03c0Lvf mp /\u03be \u223c 1025 g s\u22121 or \u223c 0.1 M\u2299 yr\u22121 . The kinetic power\nis then a few \u00d71044 erg s\u22121 for an infall velocity of v = c/3. Interestingly this is similar\nto the X-ray luminosity of PG 1211+143. Indeed a similar \"aborted jet\" model has been\nproposed by Ghisellini Haardt & Matt (2004), where matter in an outflow or jet fails to\nescape the gravitational potential well. The hard X-ray emission can be produced by shocks\nand collisions within the flow.\nAlternatively the absorption may originate from matter near the highly ionized inner\ndisk surface, with the redshift being largely gravitational in origin. Ruszkowski & Fabian\n(2000) proposed such a model to explain the absorption line in NGC 3516, although the lines\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nwill be broad unless the matter is clumped. Monitoring the line variability will help to reveal\nits origin, for instance it may possible to track the infall of a dense clump of matter towards\nthe black hole. This bodes well for future longer observations of PG 1211+143, with XMMNewton or Chandra, to track the line variability. Regardless of the mechanism, the large\nredshift and high covering fraction imply that most of the X-ray emission in PG 1211+143\noriginates from a compact region within a few Rg of the black hole.\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nREFERENCES\nAnders, E., & Grevesse, N. 1989, Geochimica et Cosmochimica Acta, 53, 197\nCash, W. 1979, ApJ, 228, 939\nDadina, M., Cappi, M., Malaguti, G., Ponti, G., & De Rosa, A. 2005, A&A, in press\nDickey, J.M. & Lockman, F.J., 1990, ARA&A, 28, 215\nDovciak, M., Bianchi, S., Guainazzi, M., Karas, V., & Matt, G. 2004, MNRAS, 350, 745\nFabian, A.C., Rees, M.J., Stella, L., & White, N.E. 1989, MNRAS, 238, 729\nGhisellini, G., Haardt, F., & Matt, G. 2004, A&A, 413, 535\nKallman, T.R., Liedahl, D., Osterheld, A., Goldstein, W., & Kahn, S. 1996, ApJ, 465, 994\nKaspi, S., Smith, P.S., Netzer, H., Maoz, D., Jannuzi, B.T., & Giveon, U. 2000, ApJ, 533,\n631\nLaor, A. 1991, ApJ, 376, L90\nMatt, G., Porquet, D., Bianchi, S., Falocco, S., Maiolino, R., Reeves, J.N., & Zappacosta,\nL. 2005, A&A, 435, 857\nMurray, N., & Chiang, J. 1998, ApJ, 494, 125\nNandra, K., George, I.M., Mushotzky, R.F., Turner, T.J., & Yaqoob, T. 1999, ApJ, 523, L17\nNandra, K., George, I.M., Mushotzky, R.F., Turner, T.J., & Yaqoob, T. 1997, ApJ, 477, 602\nPorquet, D., Reeves, J.N., Uttley, P., & Turner, T.J. 2004, A&A, 427, 101\nPounds, K.A., Reeves, J.N., King, A., Page, K., O'Brien, P.T., & Turner, M.J.L. 2003,\nMNRAS, 345, 705\nProga, D., Stone, J.M., & Kallman, T.R. 2000, ApJ, 543, 686\nReeves, J.N., Nandra, K., George, I.M., Pounds, K.A., Turner, T.J., & Yaqoob, T. 2004,\nApJ, 602, 648\nRuszkowski, M., & Fabian, A.C. 2000, MNRAS, 315, 223\nSkibo, J.G. 1997, ApJ, 478, 522\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nTanaka, Y., et al. 1995, Nature, 375, 659\nThorne, K.S. 1974, ApJ, 191, 507\nTurner, T.J., Kraemer, S.B., George, I.M., Reeves, J.N., & Bottorff, M.C. 2005, ApJ, 618,\n155\nTurner, T.J., Miller, L., George, I.M., & Reeves, J.N. 2005, A&A, in press\nTurner, T.J., et al. 2002, ApJ, 574, L123\nWalter, R., & Fink, H.H. 1993, A&A, 274, 105\nYaqoob, T., & Serlemitsos, P. 2005, ApJ, 623, 112\nYaqoob, T., & Padmanabhan, U. 2004, ApJ, 604, 63\n\nThis preprint was prepared with the AAS LATEX macros v5.2.\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\n\nFig. 1.- The upper panel shows the first order Chandra LETG spectrum of PG 1211+143\nabove 2 keV; data points are shown as filled circles and 1\u03c3 error bars as vertical lines.
