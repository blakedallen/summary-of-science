Despite the broad potential applications of polyelectrolyte multilayers (PEMs) a detailed understanding of the build up process and the resulting basic physical properties is still elusive.\nWhile the multilayer thickness, the water content, the mechanical properties and the swelling behavior of different PEMs systems have been extensively studied, their electrostatic properties are still not\nfully determined. PEMs are prepared by the layer\u2013by\u2013layer deposition of polyanions and polycations\nfrom aqueous solutions.1, 2 During the adsorption process polyanion/polycation complexes are formed\nwith the previously adsorbed polyelectrolyte layer3 leading to a charge reversal.4 The exchange of\ncounterions by the oppositely charged polyelectrolyte could be the reason for the counterion concentration inside the PEMs to be below the detection limit.5 Thus, it seems that most of the charges\nwithin the PEMs are compensated intrinsically by the opposite polymer charges and not by the\npresence of small counterions. Related to the intrinsic charge compensation may be the strong interdigitation between adjacent layers found by neutron reflectometry.6, 7 While the potential of the outer\nPEMs surface is well investigated by electrokinetic measurements,4 not much is known about the internal electrostatic properties like ion distribution and mobility. Using a pH-sensitive fluorescent dye\nthe distribution of protons within the PEMs has been determined.8 Assuming Debye screening and a\nconstant mobility for all ions within the PEMs the potential drop within polyelectrolyte films composed of poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) and poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate) (PSS) has been\ncalculated. From these measurements an independent determination of the ionic strength and the\ndielectric constant was not possible. Recent X\u2013ray fluorescence measurements have been promising\nin estimating the ion density profile inside the PEMs giving the total amount of free and condensed\nions.9\nDirect measurements of the potential drop inside the PEMs will be best suited for determining electrostatic properties such as the Debye length or the dielectric constant of the PEMs. The capacitance\nof the PEMs can be measured by electrochemical methods such as AC voltammetry.10 Another approach is the use of field effect devices which allows the determination of the surface potential at the\nsensor/electrolyte interface. Obviously, the surface potential variations measured by such a device\nare strongly dependent on screening effects inside the adjacent phase. The deposition of PAH/PSS\nas well as poly(L-lysine)/DNA multilayers and even DNA hybridization have been detected by such\ndevices.11\u201313 However, a physical model is needed to relate the quantitative response of the sensors\n\n2\n\n\fto the dielectric properties and ion mobility inside the PEMs.\nHere we show that a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) based thin film resistor is suited to monitor in real\ntime the build up of polyelectrolyte multilayers consisting of the strong polyelectrolyte PSS and the\nweak polyelectrolyte PAH. The sheet resistance of the field effect device is sensitive to variations of\nthe potential \u03c8S at the silicon oxide surface. The deposition of the differently charged polyelectrolytes\nresults in defined potential shifts, which decrease with the number of layers deposited. Applying a\ncapacitor model, the observed decrease can be quantitatively explained by assuming reduced electrostatic screening by mobile charges inside the PEMs compared to the bulk medium outside.\nExperimental Section. All chemicals including PSS (MW 70,000) and PAH (MW 60,000) were\npurchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Buffers were prepared using ultrapure water (Millipore, France) with\na resistivity > 18 M\u03a9 cm. 5 mg/ml polyelectrolyte solutions were prepared by direct dissolution in\n10 mM Tris buffer at pH 7.5 containing 50 and 500 mM NaCl, respectively.\nThe sensor chips were fabricated from commercially available silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafers (ELTRAN, Canon) using standard lithographic methods and wet chemical etching as described in detail\nelsewhere.14 The top silicon layer of these wafers was 30 nm thick and slightly doped with boron\n(1016 cm\u22123 ). Metal contacts were deposited in an electron beam evaporation chamber (20 nm Ti,\n300 nm Au). After evaporation, the sensor chips were cleaned using acetone and isopropanol. The\nchips were glued into a chip carrier and the contacts were Au-wire bonded to the carrier. Afterwards\nthe chips were encapsulated with a silicone rubber to insulate the contacts from the electrolyte solution. The sheet resistance of the device is dependent on the potential \u03c8S of the SiOx /PEMs interface\nand was measured as described elsewhere.15 The potential \u03c8S was then calculated from the sheet\nresistance by a calibration curve of the specific SOI wafer. A flow chamber was mounted on top of\nthe sensor and a Ag/AgCl reference electrode was used to control the potential of the electrolyte\nsolution and for calibration. The setup and the measurement geometry are shown schematically in\nFigure 1. First, the sensor was equilibrated in the buffer solution. Next, a calibration measurement\nwas performed as shown elsewhere.15 PAH and PSS solutions were injected twice into the flow chamber to insure full coverage of the sensor surface, starting with the positively charged PAH. After\nobtaining a stable sensor signal, the chamber was rinsed twice with buffer of the same salt concentration as the polyelectrolyte solutions. As soon as a stable signal was obtained, the next polyelectrolyte\n\n3\n\n\fsolution was injected and the procedure was repeated up to 20 times. The sheet resistance of the\nthin film resistor was monitored continuously during the multilayer deposition. In separate experiments the thickness of the deposited polyelectrolyte films was determined by an ellipsometer (Optrel,\nMultiscope, Berlin, Germany) in electrolyte solution. Care was taken to perform the preparation of\nmultilayers as close as possible to the conditions employed for the deposition on the thin film resistors.\nThe ellipsometry was carried out in the same buffer solutions used for the sample preparation.\nResults and Discussion. During the layer-by-layer deposition of the polycation PAH and the\npolyanion PSS by alternating buffer exchange, the sheet resistance of the SOI sensor was continuously\nobserved. The deposition of the alternately charged polyelectrolytes results in defined responses of\nthe sensor (Figure 2). The adsorption of PAH decreases the sheet resistance corresponding to an\nincreased \u03c8S (the potential directly at the SiOx /PEMs interface) as positive charges bind to the\nsurface. The subsequent adsorption of the negatively charged PSS increases the resistance and thus\ndecreases \u03c8S . As the SOI sensor exhibits also a pH sensitivity,15 the large potential shift between the\nPAH deposition and the subsequent washing step can be attributed to the pH of the PAH solution\nwhich is decreased to 6.4 by dissolution of the week polyelectrolyte in the buffer of pH 7.5. The\ndeposition of up to 20 monolayers was observable by the field effect device. The potential change\nbetween adjacent deposition steps \u2206\u03c8S was determined from the measured sheet resistance using the\ncalibration data and is plotted against the number of adsorbed monolayers as shown in Figure 3. It\ncan clearly be seen that the potential jumps \u2206\u03c8S decrease with the number of layers deposited. This\nis in contrast to electrokinetic studies, where the surface potential at the outer PEMs/electrolyte\ninterface is measured and the steps remain constant over a large number of deposited layers.4 The\nobserved decrease of \u2206\u03c8S can be explained by adapting a capacitor model.10, 16 The sensor device\nwith the adsorbed PEMs is modelled assuming three separate domains: (i) The sensor device, which\nis modelled as a one dimensional silicon/silicon oxide structure characterized by its capacitance per\narea CS . (ii) The PEMs consisting of N monolayers each of thickness d. (iii) The electrolyte solution\noutside the PEMs, where a diffuse electrical double layer is formed at the PEMs/electrolyte interface\n(Figure 4). In order to proceed we need to model the charge distribution within the PEMs. In\ngeneral, the layers have a complex charge distribution due to, for example, interdigitation between\npolymers from adjacent layers. This overlapping of layers can even be of the same order as the layer\n\n4\n\n\fthickness7 suggesting charge neutralization within the PEMs.5 Therefore, we consider two limiting\ncases (Figure 4): a) separate layers inside the PEMs with uniform volume charge density of \u03c1 = \u00b1 \u03c3d ,\nwhere \u03c3 may be regarded as the surface charge density of each layer\u2217 , and b) overlapping layers\nsuch that polyelectrolyte charges are completely neutralized within the PEMs, and thus the only\nuncompensated charges occur at the sensor surface and the PEMs/electrolyte interface with the\nsurface charge density of \u00b1 \u03c32 . Electrostatic screening by mobile charges is accounted for using the\nlinear Debye-H\u00fcckel (DH) theory both within the PEMs medium (which is characterized by the\nscreening length \u03ba\u22121 and the dielectric constant \u03b5) as well as in the diffuse electrical double layer of\nthe electrolyte solution (which is characterized by the bulk screening length \u03ba\u22121\n0 and the dielectric\nconstant for water \u03b5w ). One can thus identify characteristic Debye capacitances per area of CP = \u03b5\u03b50 \u03ba\nand CD = \u03b5w \u03b50 \u03ba0 for the two media, respectively. The two models a and b considered for the limiting\ncases described above yield similar results for the behavior of \u03c8S . On the linear Debye-H\u00fcckel level\neven identical results are obtained, indicating that the precise charge distribution within the PEMs is\nnot a critical factor in our model (see Supporting Information). To compare our measurements with\nthe model predictions, we calculate \u2206\u03c8S = \u03c8S (N \u2212 1) \u2212 \u03c8S (N) which can be simplified for \u03bad \u226a 1\nand even number of layers, N, yielding\n\n\u2206\u03c8S (N) =\n\n\u03c3 CD\u22121\n.\n(CS /CP + CP /CD ) sinh (\u03baNd) + (1 + CS /CD ) cosh (\u03baNd)\n\n(1)\n\nIn Eq. (1) the number of layers, N, appears only in the hyperbolic functions. A value for the screening length \u03ba\u22121 inside the PEMs can be obtained from the measured potential change \u2206\u03c8S (N) if\nthe thickness d of the polyelectrolyte layers at a given ionic strength is known. Therefore the monolayer thickness d was independently measured by ellipsometry. We found an average thickness of\nd = 1.3 \u00b1 0.1 nm for deposition from 50 mM and d = 2.2 \u00b1 0.1 nm for deposition from 500 mM\nbulk electrolyte solution, respectively. Selected ellipsometry data have been crosschecked by X\u2013ray\nsynchrotron reflectivity experiments18 confirming the obtained PEMs thicknesses. As can be seen in\nFigure 3, the measured \u2206\u03c8S can be fitted for \u03bad by Eq. (1), yielding \u03ba\u22121 = 6.5 \u00b1 1.0 nm for 500 mM\nbulk solution. A similar fit results in \u03ba\u22121 = 6.3 \u00b1 1.0 nm for the build up of the PEMs at 50 mM\n\u2217\n\nA mesh size of \u2248 30 nm can be estimated for the adsorbed polyelectrolyte layers.17 This mesh size is smaller than\nthe estimated effective persistence length of PSS (\u2248 100 nm), suggesting that alternating polyelectrolyte layers form\nwith charge densities which are equal in magnitude.\n\n5\n\n\fbulk solution. Eq. (1) also provides an estimate for the surface charge density \u03c3 of the adsorbed\npolyelectrolyte layers, assuming that CS is much smaller than CD (1 + CS /CD \u2248 1). This leads to\n\u03c3 = 0.020\n\nC\nm2\n\nfor the adsorption from 50 mM and \u03c3 = 0.022\n\nC\nm2\n\nfrom 500 mM bulk solution.\n\nThe relative dielectric constant \u03b5 of the PEMs can be calculated from \u03ba, given the definition\n\u03ba2 = 2NA e2 c/(\u03b5\u03b50kT ), where NA is Avogadro's number, e is the elementary charge, c is the ion\nconcentration, and k is the Boltzmann constant. For this, one has to determine the concentration c\nof mobile ions inside the PEMs, which is set by the thermodynamic equilibrium between the ions\nin the bulk solution (of concentration c0 ) and those in the PEMs (see Supporting Information for\ndetails). It turns out that the dominant factor governing the ion-partitioning in the PEMs/bulk\nelectrolyte system is the Born energy change,\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1\n1\ne2\n,\n\u2212\n\u2206\u03bc =\n8\u03c0\u03b50 a \u03b5 \u03b5w\n\n(2)\n\nwhich arises because of the difference in self-energy of the ions (of radius a) in the PEMs and in\nthe bulk leading to the well-known ion-partitioning law c = c0 exp(\u2212\u2206\u03bc/kT ).19, 20 Combining the\npreceding relations and the definition of \u03ba, the relative dielectric constant \u03b5 of the PEMs and the\nconcentration of mobile ions can be calculated numerically from the values obtained for \u03ba. We find\n\u03b5 = 30 \u00b1 2 and \u03b5 = 21 \u00b1 1 for the multilayers adsorbed from 50 mM NaCl and 500 mM NaCl,\nrespectively. The corresponding concentration of mobile ions inside the PEMs is estimated to be of\nthe order 0.9 \u00b1 0.3 mM and 0.6 \u00b1 0.2 mM, respectively.\nA slightly higher value of \u03b5 = 50 \u00b1 10 for the relative dielectric constant of PAH/PSS films has been\nestimated by comparing pyrene fluorescence data of the films with that of various isotropic solvents\nof low molecular weight.21 Durstock and Rubner22 found dielectric constants by factor 20 higher for\nPAH/PSS multilayers in water vapor. The large deviation from the values of the present paper is\nnot fully understood. A possible explanation could be differences in swelling behavior in water vapor\nand liquid water as shown by neutron reflectometry.\nThe different values for \u03b5 obtained for PEMs deposited from different salt concentrations can be interpreted in terms of a different water content of the polyelectrolyte films. A water content of about\n40% was estimated by neutron reflectometry for PAH/PSS films deposited from different salt con-\n\n6\n\n\fcentrations7, 23\u201325 suggesting that the ionic strength of the solution does not change the water content\nof the PEMs. Assuming an equal water content for both salt concentrations the observed variation\nof the dielectric constant could be ascribed to a different fraction of immobilized to free water within\nthe polymer layers as oriented water molecules show a lower dielectric constant. Decreased water\nmobility inside PEMs has already been determined by NMR studies.26 Comparing measurements at\ndifferent conditions will be necessary to further determine the origin of the dielectric constants of\nPEMs.\nNote that the DH approximation used in the present theoretical model is valid for relatively small\nelectrostatic potentials. At room temperature, for symmetrical monovalent electrolytes this yields\nan upper limit of 50 mV, which is typically larger than the potentials measured in our experiments.\nIn general a full non-linear Poisson-Boltzmann analysis would be necessary, which, however, is not\nanalytically solvable for the present system. The main advantage of the DH approach lies in obtaining a simple analytical expression for the sensor device functionalized by PEMs enabling a direct\ncomparison with the experimental data.\nConclusion. We were able to show that the recently introduced field effect device based on SOI is\nwell suited for the quantitative determination of charge variations at complex interfaces. We apply a\ncapacitor model including electrostatic screening by mobile charges within the PEMs to determine\ntheir dielectric constant as well as the concentration of mobile ions inside the polymer film. The origin\nof the dielectric constants found for PEMs deposited from different salt concentrations will need to\nbe addressed further. The presented theoretical description, which is given here for the PEMs, may\nprove useful also for the quantitative analysis of differently functionalized field effect devices.\nAcknowledgment.

From top to bottom: native oxide (1-2 nm), conducting top silicon (30 nm),\nburied oxide (200 nm), bulk silicon (675 \u03bcm). A voltage is applied between the source and the drain\ncontacts and the resulting current ISD is measured yielding the sheet resistance of the device. The\ncarrier concentration in the top silicon layer is tuned by the backgate voltage UBG . The potential of\nthe electrolyte solution is controlled by a Ag/AgCl reference electrode. A microfluidic device allows\nthe rapid exchange of electrolyte solution.\n\n10\n\n\fFigure 2: The deposition of four PEMs from 50 mM NaCl is shown in detail. The sheet resistance\nwas monitored continuously during the build-up process. For each deposition step the polyelectrolyte\nsolution was injected twice. When a stable signal was obtained the sensor was rinsed twice with\nbuffer. The resistance change \u2206R between adjacent deposition steps of PAH and PSS is indicated\nfor two and four adsorbed layers. The potential change between adjacent deposition steps \u2206\u03c8S was\ncalculated from \u2206R using the calibration data.

The distribution of the immobile charges (the polyelectrolyte\ncharges and the silicon oxide surface charge \u03c31 ) is shown for two limiting cases: a) separate layers\ninside the PEMs with a volume charge density \u03c1 and b) overlapping layers inside the PEMs with\nneutralized charges except for the charges at the sensor surface and the PEMs/electrolyte interface\nwith the surface charge density of \u00b1 \u03c32 . Volume charges \u03c1 are displayed in grey whereas surface charges\n\u03c3 are displayed in black. For case b) the dotted line schematically shows the potential within the\nsystem. The potential \u03c8S at the sensor surface is indicated.\n\n13\n\n\fSupporting Information\nTheoretical models for the detection of polyelectrolyte multilayers by the\nSOI-based thin film resistor\nModel a: Alternating layers with volume charges\nWe model the polyelectrolyte multilayers sensor system as a series of N alternately positively and\nnegatively charged layers with the volume charge distribution \u03c1 = \u00b1 \u03c3d (Figure 4a, main text). The\npotential in the silicon/silicon oxide structure is assumed to be linear. It is determined by the capacitance per area of the device CS =\n\n\u03b51\nd1\n\nwhich is given by the effective dielectric constant \u03b51 and the\n\nthickness d1 . The charge of the silicon oxide surface is given by \u03c31 . In the PEMs, the Debye-H\u00fcckel\n(DH) equation\nd2\n1\n\u03c8 (x) \u2212 \u03ba2 \u03c8 (x) = \u2212 \u03c1 (x)\n2\ndx\n\u03b5\nis solved for each single polyelectrolyte layer with \u03c1 (x) = \u00b1 \u03c3d . The screening length inside the PEMs\nis assumed to be \u03ba\u22121 and the dielectric constant is \u03b5. The diffuse electrical double layer in the\nelectrolyte is described by the dielectric constant for water \u03b5w and the screening length \u03ba\u22121\n0 which is\nequal to the effective double layer thickness. The actual distribution of counterions at the charged\nsurface is diffuse and reaches the unperturbed bulk value only at large distances from the surface,\nwhich is described by an exponential decay of the potential. However, a diffuse double layer behaves\nlike a parallel plate capacitor in which the separation between the plates is given by the screening\nlength \u03ba\u22121\n0 . Thus we can describe the potential within the electrolyte by a plate capacitor with\nthe Debye capacitance per area CD = \u03b5w \u03b50 \u03ba0 . The surface charges \u03c30 and \u03c3L represent the space\ncharges within the seminconductor and the electrical double layer of the electrolyte, respectively. The\npotential difference between the bulk semiconductor and the bulk electrolyte is Utot and is set by the\nreference electrode.

The two\nmodels represent limiting cases of the charge distribution. Thus in our models the charge distribution\nwithin the PEMs is not crucial for the values obtained for \u03ba\u22121 and \u03b5, respectively. For \u03bad \u226a 1 and\neven numbers of N the potential difference \u2206\u03c8S = \u03c8S (N \u2212 1) \u2212 \u03c8S (N) simplifies to eq 1 (main text).\nThe potential \u03c8S can now be calculated within the present model as a function of the number N of\nlayers deposited as shown in Figure 5.\n\nFigure 5: The potential \u03c8S was calculated within the model for the deposition from a salt concentration of 500 mM and plotted as a function of the number of adsorbed layers N. The solid lines are\na guide to the eye. For the calculation the following parameters were assumed: CS = 2 \u00d7 10\u22123 mF2 ,\nd = 2.2 nm, \u03ba\u22121 = 6.5 nm, \u03b5 = 21, \u03c31 = \u22121.25 \u00d7 10\u22122 mC2 and \u03c3 = 2.5 \u00d7 10\u22122 mC2 . In the calculation\nthe voltage between the bulk semiconductor and the bulk electrolyte was set to 7 mV.\n\nIon-partitioning between PEMs and the bulk solution\nOne can calculate the concentration of ions inside the PEMs from the thermodynamic equilibrium\ncondition with the bulk solution by minimizing the total free energy density (that is free energy per\nunit volume) of the PEMs/bulk electrolyte system as follows.\nThe total free energy density consists of the free energy density of the electrical double layer outside\nthe PEMs, F0 , and the free energy density of the PEMs medium FP . Within the Debye-H\u00fcckel\n17\n\n\fdescription, the former contribution may be written as F0 = F0MF + F0corr + F0self (in units of kT )\ncomprising the mean-field electrostatic free energy density of the double-layer, F0MF, the DebyeH\u00fcckel correlation (or excess) free energy density, F0corr , and the self-energy density of the ions, F0self .\nNote that F0corr takes into account the fact that each ion in the electrolyte is surrounded mostly by\noppositely charged ions, which amounts to the standard correlation free energy expression F0corr =\n\u2212\u03ba30 /12\u03c0, where \u03ba0 = (8\u03c0l0B c0 )1/2 is the bulk inverse screening length with l0B = e2 /(4\u03c0\u03b5w \u03b50 kT ) being\nthe bulk Bjerrum length \u2020 . It follows that within the DH approximation, the mean-field free energy\nF0MF is dominated by the entropy of the ions, which is well-approximated by that of an ideal gas of\nparticles, i.e. F0MF \u2243 2(c0 ln c0 \u2212 c0 ) assuming the bulk 1-1 electrolyte concentration of c0 . Finally the\nself-energy contribution of ions reads F0self = 2c0 l0B /2a (in units of kT ).\nSimilar expressions may be written for the PEMs medium using the inverse screening length \u03ba =\n(8\u03c0lB c)1/2 , the Bjerrum length lB = e2 /(4\u03c0\u03b5\u03b50kT ) and the ionic concentration c. In this case, the\nmean-field free energy is again approximated by that of an ideal gas since the net charge within the\nPEMs is assumed to be zero. One thus has FP (c) = 2(c ln c \u2212 c) \u2212 \u03ba30 /(12\u03c0) + 2clB /2a.\nThermodynamic equilibrium is imposed by minimizing FP (c) + F0 (c0 ) with respect to the ion concentration c inside the PEMs, assuming that c + c0 is constant, which is equivalent to setting equal\nchemical potentials for the two media. One thus finds the ion-partitioning law c = c0 exp(\u2212\u2206\u03bc/kT ),\nwhere\nlB\n\u2206\u03bc =\n2\n\n\u0012\n\n1\n1\n\u2212 \u22121\na \u03ba\n\n\u0013\n\nl0\n\u2212 B\n2\n\n\u0012\n\n1\n1\n\u2212 \u22121\na \u03ba0\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\nThe terms proportional to 1/a (with a being the mean ion radius) are due to the self-energy (Born\nenergy) difference of the ions in the two media, whereas the terms proportional to the Debye screening\nlength come from the DH correlation free energy difference. Since \u03ba\u22121 and \u03ba\u22121\n0 are typically much\nlarger than a, one can neglect this latter contribution. In fact, an explicit estimate of the dielectric\nconstant of the PEMs, \u03b5, including the DH correlation free energy shows slightly larger values (up to\na few percents) as compared with the results reported in the text (obtained based only on the Born\nenergy). The difference is however within the experimental error bars.\n\n\u2020\n\nResibois, P. M. V. Electrolyte Theory; Harper & Row: New York, 1968.\n\n18\n\n\f"}
