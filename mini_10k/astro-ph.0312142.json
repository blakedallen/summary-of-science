These EROs have high\nresolution morphologies from HST and were selected with a median Ks magnitude\nof 18.7 and (F 814W \u2212 Ks ) > 4 mag. (Yan & Thompson 2003). Among the\n24 redshifts, the majority (92%) are at 0.9 < z < 1.5. We derived the restframe J-band luminosity function at zmedian = 1.14. Our result suggests that the\nluminosity evolution between bright EROs at z \u223c 1 and the present-day >L\u2217\nmassive galaxies is at most about 0.7 magnitude. Combining the morphologies\nand deep spectroscopy revealed that the 24 EROs have the following properties.\n(1) 86% of the spectra have absorption features from old stars, suggesting that\nthe dominant stellar populations seen in the rest-frame UV are old stars. 50% of\nthe sources have pure absorption lines, while the remaining 50% have emission\nlines, indicating recent star formation. We conclude that the color criterion for\nEROs is very effective in selecting old stellar populations at z \u223c 1, and a large\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\nfraction of these systems with prominent old stellar populations also have recent\nstar formation. (2) The 12 emission line systems have the same number of disk\nand bulge galaxies as in the remaining 12 pure absorption line systems. We\nconclude that spectral classes do not have a simple, direct correspondence with\nmorphological types. (3) Three EROs could be isolated, pure passively evolving\nearly-type galaxies at z \u223c 1. This implies that only a small fraction (10%\u201315%) of\nearly-type galaxies are formed in a rapid burst of star formation at high redshifts\nand evolved passively since then. (4) Three EROs have very red continua and\npure emission line spectra. Their redshifts and star formation rates are similar to\nthat of HR 10. These three sources are potential candidates for dusty starbursts.\n(5) We identified three AGNs (13%), which is consistent with what has been\nfound by deep Chandra observations.\nSubject headings: galaxies: bulges \u2013 galaxies: spirals \u2013 galaxies: star bursts \u2013\ngalaxies: absorption lines \u2013 galaxies: emission lines \u2013 galaxies: high-redshifts\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn recent years, significant progress has been made in the study of Extremely Red\nObjects (EROs), i.e. galaxies selected by the color criteria of either (I \u2212 Ks ) > 4 mag. or\n(R \u2212 Ks ) > 5 mag. These are the expected colors of a pure passively evolving old stellar\npopulation at roughly a redshift of one. Several recent wide field near-IR surveys (McCarthy\net al. 2002; Cimatti et al. 2002; Roche et al. 2002) have provided large datasets for measuring\nthe surface densities of EROs down to faint K magnitudes and for ERO clustering analysis\n(Daddi et al. 2000a; McCarthy et al. 2001). These surveys found that the ERO angular\ncorrelation strength is comparable to that of low redshift early-type galaxies (Davis & Geller\n1976; Willmer, da Costa & Pellegrini 1998), and about a factor of 10 higher than that of\naverage field galaxies. These results are partly due to the narrow redshift range selected by\nthe color criteria. Additional interpretation is that the EROs at z \u2265 1.0 are progenitors of\npresent-day early-type galaxies (McCarthy et al. 2001).\nSpectroscopy of EROs provides additional information on their physical properties. The\nspectral properties set constraints on their star formation history and stellar populations.\nSimilar to the earlier spectroscopic work on the individual sources HR 10 (Graham & Dey\n1996) and CL0939+4713B (Soifer et al. 1999), spectroscopy of a sample of 30 EROs from the\nK20 survey (Cimatti et al. 2002) also found that EROs are a mix of both emission line and\nabsorption line systems, in a ratio of 1:1. Based on the presence of emission lines, Cimatti\net al. (2002) concluded that 50% of their ERO sample are dusty star-forming galaxies and\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nthe remaining 50% are early-type systems. This conclusion is based on an assumption that\nthe galaxy spectral classes correspond to the galaxy morphological classes.\nCombining high resolution imaging from HST with ground-based K-band images, we\ncarried out a morphological study of 115 EROs selected with (F 814W \u2212 Ks ) > 4 mag.\n(Yan & Thompson, 2003; hereafter Paper I). We found that only 30\u00b15% of the EROs have\nmorphologies consistent with a pure bulge or bulge-dominated galaxy (equivalent to E/S0),\nwhile disks comprise 64\u00b17% of the sample. Only 6% of the EROs remained unclassifiable.\nMergers or strongly interacting systems, which include sources from both classes, make up\n17\u00b14% of the full sample. These results suggest that the nature of EROs are complex.\nHigh resolution morphologies as well as spectroscopy are needed to better understand this\npopulation at high redshifts.\nThe heterogeneous nature of EROs selected by their optical/near-IR colors has also been\nhighlighted by X-ray and sub-millimeter observations. Deep Chandra and XMM observations\nof EROs with Ks < 20.1 reveal that roughly 15\u201320% of EROs are detected in hard X-rays,\nconsistent with their being obscured Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), while roughly another\n15% are detected in the soft X-ray band, and are therefore either low-luminosity AGNs or\nstarbursts (Alexandra et al. 2002; Brusa et al. 2002). The 850\u03bcm observations of relatively\nbright EROs (Ks < 19.5) produced a fairly low detection rate, only about 20% (Thompson\n2003, private communication; Andreani et al. 1999; Mohan et al. 2002). This suggests\nthat ULIRG type galaxies are relatively uncommon in bright ERO samples. However, deep\nnear-IR observations (Ks > 20.5) of sub-mm selected sources found that close to half of the\n850\u03bcm detections have very red colors, with (J \u2212 Ks ) >2.6 mag (Frayer et al. 2003).\nWe found in Paper I that there can be significant differences in the ERO populations\nselected by either (I \u2212 K) > 4 mag. or (R \u2212 K) > 5 mag. Both color selection criteria are\nsensitive to dust reddened galaxies and systems dominated by old stellar populations at a\nredshift of one. However, using the Bruzual & Charlot (Bruzual & Charlot 1996) models, we\nshowed in Paper I (Figure 8) that the EROs selected with (I \u2212K) > 4 mag. can include more\nsystems which have somewhat prolonged star formation (e.g. \u03c4 = 1 Gyr galaxies), whereas\nthe (R \u2212 K) > 5 mag. selection would be biased against these types because star formation\ncould contribute enough blue light to make the galaxy drop out of (R \u2212 Ks ) > 5 mag.\nselected sample. On another hand, (R \u2212 Ks ) criteria also selects a higher fraction of lower-z\nsources because the Balmer/4000A breaks are still effectively contributing to the (R \u2212 Ks )\ncolors. We should point out that ERO is no longer very useful designation, simply because\ngalaxies selected are highly dependent on what color criteria and photometric depths of the\ndata. Different color selections inevitably produce different galaxy samples with different\nproperties. It is important to understand these differences before making any comparisons\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nbetween surveys using different color selections.\nTo complement the morphological study carried out in Paper I, we have obtained spectroscopic observations for a subset of the EROs from Paper I. The goal was to determine\nthe redshift distribution, luminosity functions, spectral properties, and to map out the correspondence between the morphologies and spectral types. Throughout the paper, we used\nthe cosmology of \u03a9m = 0.3, \u03a9\u039b = 0.7 and H0 = 70 km/s/Mpc.\n\n2.\n\nObservations and Reductions\n\nWe obtained spectroscopic observations for 36 sources from the original sample of 115\nEROs, which have a median Ks of 18.m 7 and (F 814W \u2212 Ks ) > 4 mag. Because the positions\nof the EROs in our sample are distributed all over the sky (see Paper I), the spectroscopic\ntarget fields were primarily selected by their accessibility during the observing run, with\npriority given to fields containing higher numbers of EROs. No other selection criteria were\nimposed on the spectroscopic targets, and we obtained spectra for all of the EROs in each\ntarget field. We used the Low Resolution Imaging Spectrograph (LRIS, Oke et al. 1995)\non the Keck i telescope on the nights of UT 2002 September 1-4. The weather conditions\nwere not photometric and cirrus were present during all four nights. The seeing was around\n1\u2032\u2032 . The D680 dichroic and the 400 l/mm grating blazed at 8500\u00c5 in the LRIS red side\nwere used to optimize wavelength coverage in the critical 8000 \u00c5 \u2013 1 \u03bcm region, where the\nstrong spectral features, primarily [O II] emission and Ca II H+K absorption, are expected\nfor z > 1 galaxies. In the LRIS blue side, we used the 300 l/mm grating blazed at 5000 \u00c5.\nMulti-slit masks were set up for all WFPC2 fields containing two or more EROs, using 1.2\u2032\u2032\nwide slits. In order to facilitate sky subtraction, we dithered the targets along the slits\nbetween successive exposures, with offsets of 2\u2032\u2032 \u20134\u2032\u2032 . The integration time for each exposure\nwas 1200 seconds. The total integration time for each multi-slit mask was 1\u20131.5 hrs.\nThe data were reduced using a suite of IRAF scripts written by Daniel Stern (private\ncommunication 2002). Each slitlet was treated as a separate, long-slit spectrum. Bias was\nsubtracted by fitting low order polynomials to the overscan regions. The blue and red CCDs\nwere read out using four and two amplifiers, respectively. The fitting was done for each\noverscan region for each amplifier separately. Sky lines were subtracted by fitting high order\npolynomials along the spatial direction in each two-dimensional (2D) spectrum. The order\nof this polynomial fitting was scaled to the length of the slit, with a minimum of three for\nthe shortest slits. A fringe map was made by median combining the dithered 2D images,\nexcluding the one from which the fringe map was subtracted, then the fringe map was\nsubtracted from each of the 2D spectral images.\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nCosmic ray removal was done on the individual images using the IRAF script SZAP\nfrom the DIMSUM package1 . First, the sky lines were modeled with polynomial fitting\nand taken out from each image. Then object spectra were removed by subtracting the\nmedian-combined and smoothed (with a 5x5 boxcar) images. Cosmic rays were identified\nby comparing the flux in the residual images to the expected noise calculated from the 2D\nmodel. Pixels affected by cosmic rays were replaced by the values from the model. The 2D\nspectra were not rectified before extracting the 1D spectra.\nAfter the sky line subtraction and cosmic ray removal, all 2D spectra of a given ERO\nwere shifted and average-combined to create the final stacked 2D spectrum. The IRAF task\nAPALL was then used to extract the 1D spectra. The wavelength solutions were obtained\nfrom 3rd order polynomial fits to the sky lines in the object spectra. In the LRIS red side\nspectra, there were many sky lines for wavelength calibration, and the wavelength solutions\nhave residual uncertainties less than 0.3\u00c5. In the blue side, there are a fewer lines, with\nthe residual uncertainties typically less than 1.0\u00c5. Flux calibration was done using long slit\nspectra of several standard stars. The spectra of these bright stars were also used to remove\nthe atmospheric absorption bands in the red LRIS spectra around 6867\u00c5 - 6944\u00c5 (B-band),\n7168\u00c5 - 7394\u00c5 (b-band), and 7594\u00c5 - 7684\u00c5 (A-band). We note that the D680 dichroic\nproduces a sharp drop of sensitivity around 6800\u00c5 in the spectra.\n\n3.\n3.1.\n\nResults and Discussion\nThe Redshift Sample\n\nOf the 36 targets observed, redshifts were obtained for 22 extragalactic EROs. We\nalso identified one M star. Two additional EROs have redshifts from the Hawaii redshift\nsurvey (Cowie et al. 1996), which makes a total of 24 EROs with redshifts from the Paper I\nsample. The source identifications, K-band magnitudes (within an aperture diameter of 2.5\ntimes the seeing disk), (F 814W \u2212 Ks ) colors, redshifts, quality ranks, emission line fluxes,\nmorphologies, and spectral features used for the redshift measurements for the 24 EROs are\nlisted in Table 1. The redshift quality rank describes how secure a redshift measurement is,\nwhere \"a\" is for redshifts measured from multiple, well detected spectral features, including\nboth absorption and emission lines; \"b\" is for redshifts measured from multiple, but weak\nspectral features; and \"c\" indicates redshifts derived from only a single spectral feature.\n1\n\nDeep Infrared Mosaicking Software, a package written by Eisenhardt, Dickinson, Stanford and Ward,\navailable at http://iraf.noao.edu/contrib/dimsumV2\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nFigure 1 shows six representative spectra, 2 with emission lines and 4 with absorption lines,\nfrom our whole sample. The spectra in this figure are smoothed with a boxcar of 11 pixels\n(20 \u00c5for the LRIS red spectra and 16 \u00c5for the LRIS blue spectra). Among the six spectra\nshown in this figure, the three redshifts have quality a and the remaining three have quality\nb.\nFigure 2 shows the redshift distribution. The median redshift of the sample is 1.14.\nThe distribution is strongly peaked around this redshift, and weakly extends to both lower\nredshift (z \u2264 0.8) and higher redshift (z \u223c 1.5). The fraction of z \u2264 0.9 interlopers is\n8% (2/24) for our redshift sample. This estimate of low redshift EROs could have a large\nerror because of the small size of our sample. The drop-off at the high redshift end of\nthe distribution is due to fainter apparent magnitudes, redder colors because of higher Kcorrections, and the strong spectral features moving out of our wavelength range. Figure 3\npresents the distributions of the (F 814W \u2212 Ks ) color and the F 814W magnitude for both\nthe sources with and without redshifts. The 13 sources without redshifts are 0.5 magnitude\nfainter in F 814W and 0.3 magnitude redder in the (F 814W \u2212 Ks ) color than the sources\nwith redshifts. However, Figure 2 and Figure 3 also show that the sources with and without\nredshifts have overall similar properties, and that they appear to be from the same parent\npopulation.\nAs described in \u00a7 2, the 36 spectroscopic targets were selected by their accessibility\nduring the observing run, with priority given to fields containing higher numbers of EROs;\nno other criteria were imposed. These 36 sources have roughly the same mix in morphological\nclasses as in the original sample of 115 EROs. Specifically, the spectroscopic sample has 61%\n(22/36) of disks or disk dominated (D+DB) galaxies, and 34% (12/36) of bulges or bulge\ndominated (B+BD) systems, in comparison with 64% and 30% respectively in the original\nsample.\nAt the median redshift of our sample (z \u223c 1.1), the morphologies are based on restframe B band light. The recent ERO morphology study (Moustakas et al. 2003) based on\nthe HST/ACS F850LP (z band) images found a slightly higher fraction of bulges or bulge\ndominated galaxies (40%) and somewhat lower fraction of disk type of systems (40%). This\nis expected since the F850LP filter samples the light long-ward of 4000\u00c5 and thus is more\nsensitive to old stars.\nOur success rate in measuring redshifts is high in the B+BD systems (10/12), but much\nlower in the D+DB galaxies (12/22). Among the 13 sources without redshift, the majority\n(10/13) are disk dominated galaxies with small bulges (DB); six have edge-on geometry. A\nsimple reason for the high success rate in measuring redshifts for B+BD galaxies is because\nthe (I \u2212 Ks ) > 4 mag. color limit is very effective in selecting the bulges or bulge dominated\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\ngalaxies with predominantly old stars and little dust at z>\n\u223c1. Our spectroscopic data (see\n\u00a7 3.4) provides further evidence for this. The spectroscopic bias against measuring redshifts\nfor DB type sources could be due to several reasons. Star formation in some of these systems\ncould be intrinsically weak, thus difficult to detect, especially for the edge-on disks which\nhave inherently higher obscuration. In addition, the oldest stars and younger star forming\nregions form the strong spectral features we use for redshift identification. If the integrated\nlight from the DB type EROs are mostly from intermediate age stellar populations, their\nspectra would have weaker spectral lines, thus it is more difficult to measure their redshifts.\n\n3.2.\n\nThe Rest-frame J-band Luminosity Function at zmedian = 1.14\n\nIdeally, when we trace the galaxy evolutionary history, we want to select a specific galaxy\npopulation at high redshift, e.g. z=1, and compare them with the low redshift sources which\nshould have the same parent population at high redshift. Only such a fair comparison will\ngive us a unbiased view of the galaxy evolution. Our redshift sample has a median redshift\nof 1, and is selected by the color of (I \u2212 Ks > 4) mag. and Ks < 18.7. These criteria should\nselect most of luminous > L\u2217 galaxies with SEDs of old stellar population at z \u223c 1, except\nsmall number of dusty galaxies at lower redshifts and photometric errors causing sources\nscattered in-and-out of our selection. In principle, the photometric incompleteness could\nbe quantified by simulations. However, in this paper, because our redshift sample is fairly\nsmall, the errors due to small number statistics will dominate our analyses. Thus, we will\nnot go into the detailed simulation to quantify how complete our selection criteria sample\nthe z \u223c 1 luminous galaxies with SEDs of old stellar population.\nTo understand the relation between the galaxies selected with (I \u2212Ks > 4) mag. at z \u223c 1\nand present-day massive galaxies, it is instructive to compare their luminosity functions,\nwhich describe the source density per co-moving volume per absolute magnitude in a certain\nfilter band. As shown below, we will compare our rest-frame J-band luminosity function\nwith the present-day J-band luminosity function for galaxies of all types (Cole et al. 2001),\nand with the rest-frame J-band luminosity functions at z=1.0 measured from the K20 survey\n(Pozzetti et al. 2003). Here we are limited to use the present-day J-band luminosity function\nfor all galaxies types because there are no published data for early type galaxies. However,\nbecause the sources in our redshift sample are very luminous, our comparison is most limited\nto bright end of the luminosity function (as seen below). Therefore, the mismatch is probably\nvery small.\nAt the median redshift of our sample (zmedian = 1.14), the observed Ks filter corresponds\nto the rest-frame J band. We compute the absolute magnitude at the rest-frame J-band for\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nan object with an apparent Ks magnitude at redshift of z, using the following equation:\nMJ = mKs \u2212 25 \u2212 5.0 log10 (DL /Mpc) \u2212 kc \u2212 A\n\n(1)\n\nHere A is the galactic extinction, which is generally very small, less than 0.04 magnitude\nin Ks band. The k-correction term, kc , describes the color difference between the observed\nand the rest-frame bandpasses (Oke & Sandage 1986; Kim, Goobar & Perlmutter 1997).\n\n\u0012R\n\u0013\nZ(\u03bb)SJ (\u03bb)d\u03bb\nkc =\u2212 2.5 log10 R\nZ(\u03bb)SKs (\u03bb)d\u03bb\n+ 2.5 log10 (1 + z)\n!\nR\nF (\u03bb)SJ (\u03bb)d\u03bb\n+ 2.5 log10 R\n\u03bb\nF ( (1+z)\n)SKs (\u03bb)d\u03bb\n\n(2)\n\nHere Z(\u03bb) is the SED for \u03b1 Lyrae, S(\u03bb) is the filter transmission curve, F (\u03bb) is the\nassumed galaxy SED template. As shown above, kc includes the zero point difference between\ntwo different filters, as well as the color difference due to the redshifted SED (Kim, Goobar\n& Perlmutter 1997). At zero redshift, kc becomes the J \u2212 Ks color of a galaxy with the\nassumed SED. We took the \u03b1 Lyrae SED from Bruzual & Charlot (1996) and the standard\nMauna Kea J and Ks filter curves from Simons & Tokunaga (2002). The k-correction was\ncomputed for an early-type SED, and is -1.58 at z = 1.0. The uncertainties in k-correction\ndue to different SEDs should be very small because at z \u223c 1 the observed Ks band is roughly\nequivalent to the rest-frame J band.\nWe used the 1/Vmax method (Schmidt 1968; Felten 1976) to calculate the rest-frame\nJ-band luminosity function. We adopted the cosmology with \u03a9M = 0.3, \u03a9\u039b = 0.7 and\nH0 = 70 km/s/Mpc. The maximum co-moving volume for a source is defined as the volume\nwithin which the source could still be above the flux limit of the sample. In the 1/Vmax\napproach, the galaxy luminosity function \u03c6(M), the number of galaxies per co-moving volume\nper absolute magnitude, is simply:\n\u03c6(M) =\n\n1 X 1\ni\n\u2206M i Vmax\n\n(3)\n\nFor each source within our redshift sample, we compute its maximum volume. Because\nof field-to-field differences in exposure times, atmospheric seeing, or dithering, our survey\narea is a function of the limiting magnitude. To account for this effect when calculating the\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nvolume factor used in the luminosity function, we integrated the survey area over the ten\nspectroscopic target fields as a function of magnitude (see Paper I for details). The resulting\ndifferential area histogram was then used to calculate an effective survey volume for each\nERO with a spectroscopic redshift.\nFigure 4 shows the rest-frame J-band luminosity function of the K-selected EROs at\nz \u223c 1. The solid points are the measurements using only the sources with redshifts, whereas\nthe circles are the measurements of the luminosity function including also the sources without any redshifts, by artificially setting their redshifts to the median redshift of 1.14. This\nis one of the crude ways to compute the incompleteness correction. Because our color criteria select galaxies within a relatively narrow redshift space, setting z = 1.14 for galaxies\nwithout redshift measurement is not a far off approximation. The purpose of doing this\nis to demonstrate the approximate amplitude of the correction, rather than producing an\naccurate measurement.\nIn Figure 4, we compare our results with 1). the local J-band luminosity function (Cole\net al. 2001) (solid curve in Figure 4); 2). the rest-frame J-band luminosity function at\n0.75 < z < 1.3 using a K-band flux limited spectroscopic sample (long dashed curve in\nFigure 4) (Pozzetti et al. 2003); 3). the rest-frame J-band luminosity function at 0.75 <\nz < 1.3 for galaxies with pure absorption lines in the K20 survey (dotted curve in Figure 4,\nPozzetti 2003, private communication). It is not surprising that our data points are somewhat\nhigher than the dotted curve which indicates the LF for pure absorption line galaxies from\nthe K20 survey. As shown by our results, selecting only pure absorption line galaxies will\nunderestimate the volume density of old stellar populations at redshift of 1.0. Ideally, we\nshould compare our result with the local J-band LF of early type galaxies, however, there\nis no published measurement in the literature. As discussed in the begining of this section,\nsince our sources are mostly luminous (> L\u2217 ) galaxies, the comparison with the local J-band\nLF for all galaxy types should not be too far off. The luminosity evolution between the\nlocal LF and the LF at z=1.0 from the K20 survey is roughly 0.7 magnitude (Pozzetti et al.\n2003). Our measurements lie roughly along the dashed curve. The EROs are a color selected\nsubset of a general K-band flux limited sample. The high volume density implied by our\ndata points can be explained by the significant clustering in our ERO redshift sample, since\nthe spectroscopic targets were selected with higher priority given to fields containing higher\nnumbers of EROs. We computed the ERO surface density in our redshift sample, which is\na factor of 2\u20133 higher than that of the original sample. This is a direct evidence that the\nEROs in our redshift sample are clustered within small volumes.\nAlthough the rest-frame J-band luminosity function at z = 1.14 we derived from our\nsample is highly biased, it does set an upper limit on the amount of luminosity evolution\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nEROs could have if compared to the present-day >L\u2217 luminous galaxies. Any properly\nselected ERO sample should be less clustered over a larger area, and its luminosity function\nwould be lower compared to what we measured. Thus, we conclude that the luminosity\nevolution between bright EROs at z \u223c 1 and the present-day massive galaxies is small,\nabout 0.7 magnitude.\nWe also compute the rest-frame J-band luminosity density from our data, which is\nP\ni\nl = i Li /Vmax\n, over the range of M of -24.0 to -26.0. The logrithmic of the rest-frame Jband luminosity density for galaxies brighter than -24, log10 (l), is 19.86 Watt/Hz/Mpc3 and\n20.02 Watt/Hz/Mpc3 for the redshift sample and the sample including sources without redshifts respectively. These numbers are slightly higher than the luminosity density computed\nfrom the rest-frame J-band LF at z = 1.0 from the K20 survey, integrated from -24.0 to\n-26.0 (log10 (l) = 19.8 Watt/Hz/Mpc3 ). Again, this could be explained by somewhat higher\nclustering in our small sample. In order to evaluate the amplitude of the evolution strength,\nwe also compute the local J-band luminosity density, log10 (l) is 19.18 Watt/Hz/Mpc3 , using the measurement from Cole et al. (2002). We found that luminosity density evolution\nbetween now and redshift of 1 is \u2206 log10 (l)/\u2206 log10 (1 + z) = 2.3.\n\n3.3.\n\nCorrespondence between Morphologies and Spectral Types\n\n[O II] \u03bb3727\u00c5 emission was detected in 12 of the 24 sources listed in Table 1. Thus,\n50% of our sample with redshifts have emission lines, and the other 50% are pure absorption\nline galaxies. These percentages are the same as found in the K20 survey (Cimatti et al.\n2002). In Paper I, we classified disks or disk dominated systems as D+DB, and bulge or\nbulge dominated as B+BD. The two spectral classes, emission line versus absorption line,\nhave a similar mix of bulge and disk dominated morphological types. Specifically, among\nthe 12 sources with [O II] \u03bb3727\u00c5 emission lines, 7 are D+DB and 5 are B+BD systems,\nwhile of the 12 absorption line sources, 7 are classified as D+DB and 5 as B+BD. The ERO\nmorphological classes do not have a simple correspondence with the presence of emission\nlines or absorption lines. As stated in \u00a7 3.1, the redshift sample (24 sources) have slightly\nhigher fraction of B+BD galaxies than that of D+DB, on a level of 10%. Considering our\nsmall size sample and large uncertainties, we do not attempt to correct for any morphological\nbiases in the redshift sample.\nThis result is visually shown in Figure 5 using the HST/WFPC2 stamp image of each\nERO. The four panels in this figure present the four categories of EROs - (a) disks with\nemission lines, (b) disks with pure absorption lines, (c) bulges with emission lines, and (d)\nbulges with pure absorption lines. The emission line sources, including both bulges and disks\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\n(groups a and c), are at slightly higher redshifts and have slightly brighter Ks magnitudes\nthan the absorption line systems (groups b and d). The bulges with pure absorption lines\nare the reddest subset in the (F 814W \u2212 Ks ) color, but the two reddest systems are disks.\nFigure 5.a shows the disks with emission lines. These systems are probably dust reddened, and also have star forming activity in their disks. One obvious example of dust\nreddening is shown in the second stamp image in panel a; the dust lane is clearly present\nin this galaxy. Figure 5.b shows the EROs which are morphologically classified as disk\ndominated but without detectable emission lines. These are the quiescent disks. In Paper I, we classified four of these as edge-on disks. It is possible that the inherently high\nobscuration in the edge-on orientation make the disks faint, while the central bulges are\nrelatively unobscured and bright. This would also explain why these sources are at z \u223c 1\nsince the (I \u2212 Ks ) > 4 mag. criterion should select old stellar populations at these redshifts.\nFigure 5.c presents \"rejuvenated old stellar populations\". These are the bulge dominated\nsystems (B+BD) with emission lines. The HST/WFPC2 images show that these bulges with\nemission lines have clear indications of mergers/interactions, such as tidal tails, asymmetric\nnuclei or multiple faint companions. The star formation triggered by these interactions produces the detected emission lines. However, the dominant stellar populations in these bulges\nare old stars. Figure 5.d presents the five absorption line bulges (B+BD). Among them,\nthree are pure bulges (no evidence of disks) which could be identified as passively evolving\nearly-type galaxies at z \u223c 1. The statistics (3/24) from our survey suggests that the fraction\nof this type of system is small, around 10\u221215%. This result sets a strong constraint on the\ntraditional galaxy formation scenario, in which massive ellipticals formed at high redshifts\nin a burst of star formation and passively evolved to the present day (Kauffmann & Charlot,\n1998).\nExcluding the three AGNs (see \u00a7 3.5) and the two sources without reported line fluxes\nfrom the Hawaii Redshift Survey (Cowie et al. 1996), the [O II] \u03bb3727\u00c5 line fluxes in the\nremaining seven sources are in the range of 5 \u00d7 10\u221218 - 4 \u00d7 10\u221217 ergs/s/cm2 . These line\nfluxes are the raw measurements, not corrected for light losses due to the finite slit width\nor extinction. Using the conversion from Kennicutt (1998), where the star formation rate\n(SFR, M\u2299 yr\u22121 ) = 1.4\u00d710\u221241 L[O II] (ergs/s), we calculate that the SFRs in these seven\nsources are in the range of 0.4 \u2013 6 M\u2299 /yr. The star formation rates measured from the rest\nframe [O II] \u03bb3727\u00c5 line are only lower limits because dust extinction could be significant.\nThe highest star formation rate in our sample is 6 M\u2299 /yr for ufg00 121, comparable to\nHR 10 (Dey et al. 1999), which has an [O II] star-formation rate of 4.8 M\u2299 /yr in our\nassumed cosmology model. HR 10 is a massive dusty starburst based on millimeter and\nsub-mm observations, suggesting that ufg00 121 could be a similar system. Clearly longer\nwavelength observations using SIRTF and SCUBA are required to measure the total star\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nformation rates for the very dusty systems.\nThe global volume-averaged star formation rate is shown to rise steeply from the present\nday to redshifts of 1 - 2 (Madau et al. 1996; Lilly et al. 1996; Yan et al. 1999). The\nmorphological properties observed in our ERO sample and the high fraction of star forming\nsystems could be largely due to this evolutionary effect at z \u223c 1. Finally, our observed result\ncould also be due to the color selection. The (I \u2212 Ks ) > 4 mag. color selects more old, red\nbulges with small disks or residual star formation (S0, Sa like systems) than what is selected\nwith an (R \u2212 Ks ) > 5 mag. criterion. This is mainly because the R-band is more sensitive\nto star formation. More details about this color selection effect are given in Paper I.\n\n3.4.\n\nOld versus Young Stars\n\nThe presence of nebular emission lines, such as [O II] \u03bb3727\u00c5 in spectra are a sensitive\nprobe of recent star formation. Although half of our redshift sample have [O II] emission,\nthe spectra of most sources have not only very red continua but also absorption line features,\nsuch as H+K, G-band, or a 4000 \u00c5 break. These features are the indicators of old stars.\nSpecifically, excluding two EROs from the Hawaii Redshift Survey (Cowie et al. 1996), we\nhave 19 spectra which show absorption lines, seven of which also have emission lines. Only\nthree EROs have pure emission line spectra. This implies that a large fraction (19/22) of the\nEROs in our redshift sample, including both bulge and disk dominated systems, have mostly\nold stellar populations with an additional small amount of young stars formed more recently.\nA good example is shown in the bottom panel of Figure 1, u2fq1 085. The morphology of this\nERO shows a prominent bulge with a faint disk; the red portion of its spectrum clearly shows\nabsorption features from old stars in the bulge and the blue portion of its spectrum has an\n[O II] \u03bb3727\u00c5 emission line, indicating star forming activity in the disk. Early-type galaxies\nwith recent star formation are also found in the field (Treu et al. 2002; van Dokkum &\nStanford 2002). Thus, using only the presence of emission lines as the diagnostic to separate\nEROs into the two categories of early-type versus dusty star forming systems can lead to\nsignificant mis-classification.\nAt the other extreme, three EROs, ufg00 121, u2fq1 130 and u2fq1 115, have only\n[O II] \u03bb3727\u00c5 emission, and no detectable absorption lines. The red continua observed\nin these three sources are probably due to dust extinction. Two of these EROs have disk\ntype morphologies, the other is a bulge. They are the most likely candidates for being very\ndusty and having strong star formation like HR 10 (Dey et al. 1999). [O II] \u03bb3727\u00c5 emission\nwas detected in HR 10, with an uncorrected SFR of 4.8 M\u2299 /yr. Its spectrum shows a very\nred continuum but no significant absorption lines.\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nFigure 6 shows the (F 814W \u2212 Ks ) color as a function of the redshift for the sample\nlisted in Table 1. In the figure, the model curves are calculated using the Bruzual & Charlot\n(1996) spectral energy distributions (SED), with different assumptions on the star formation\nhistory. The solid dots identify the three bulges with absorption line spectra. These systems\ncould be pure passively evolving early-type galaxies formed in a rapid star burst at high\nredshift, evolving only passively since then. Since their colors are slightly redder than the\n\u03c4 = 0.1 Gyr models, this could suggest that there is a small amount of dust in these galaxies.\nOur data alone can not discriminate the models with two very different formation redshifts.\nThe open circles in the figure indicate the remaining 88% (21/24) of the sample, which\nhave large or small disks, as well as the bulges with emission lines. The observed colors\nof these EROs are consistent with the colors from the three models, where dust, multiple\nepochs of star formation, and old stellar populations all could play some role in determining\ntheir colors. This highlights the complex physical properties of EROs at z \u223c 1.\nUltimately, the goal is to obtain more quantitative estimate of what fraction of the Kband light is due to old stars in these optical/near-IR color selected galaxies. In principle,\nthis can be done if one has high S/N spectra and good broad band photometry. Stellar population synthese models could be used to fit both broad band SEDs, as well as emission line\nand absorption line spectra. This will decompose the stellar population and quantitatively\nmeasure the fraction of K-band light due to old stars. Although our current data does not\npermit us doing this analyses, in the future, such analyses should be done properly with\nbetter datasets.\n\n3.5.\n\nAGNs and Clusters\n\nThree EROs in our redshift sample have AGN signatures. Both u2fq1 128 and u2fq1 389,\nshow C III] \u03bb1909\u00c5 and C II] \u03bb2326\u00c5 semi-forbidden emission lines in their spectra. Figure 7 shows the spectrum of u2fq1 128, smoothed with a boxcar of 5 pixels (7.3\u00c5). The\nobserved full widths at half maximum (FWHM) in the emission lines are about 3740 km/s\nfor u2fq1 128 and 790 km/s for u2fq1 389. The source u2fq1 128 is classified as a bulge dominated system, while u2fq1 389 has a faint disk (Paper I). Both are likely dust-shrouded, lowluminosity AGN, with the broad-lined u2fq1 128 being a Seyfert I galaxy and the narrowerlined u2fq1 389 being a Seyfert II or LINER galaxy.\nThe third AGN is ufg00 044. The top panel in Figure 8 shows the HST/WFPC2 F814W\nimages of ufg00 044 and ufg00 083. These two EROs are separated by 6.6 arcseconds (56 kpc\nprojected separation), both have [O II] \u03bb3727\u00c5 emission lines and are at z \u223c 1.33 (Figure 5,\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\nbottom left panel). These two EROs are clearly situated in a high density region, with\nevidence for ongoing merging/interaction. The slit went through both ERO ufg00 044 and\nufg00 083, as well as two fainter galaxies. In Figure 8, the bottom right panel shows the\n2D spectra in the observed wavelength region of 8635 - 8748\u00c5, and that ufg00 044 has a\nbroad [O II] \u03bb3727\u00c5 line. The observed velocity width is 609 km/s. In addition, it also has\n[Ne III] \u03bb3867\u00c5 emission (not shown in Figure 8), confirming the bright line is [O II] \u03bb3727\u00c5.\nObject ufg00 044 is clearly in an actively merging environment. The velocity extension\nabove its broad [O II] line probably comes from the close companion (C). Perhaps this close\ninteraction is the trigger of its AGN activity. The bottom left panel in Figure 8 covers the\nwavelength from 7614 - 7727\u00c5; the emission line source with no detected continuum between\nthe two EROs is object F. Its spectrum has two emission lines, H\u03b2 and [O III] \u03bb5007\u00c5, and is\na foreground galaxy at z = 0.50. The [O III] \u03bb4959\u00c5 falls within the atmospheric absorption\nA band, and thus this line is only weakly detected.\nThe one mega-second Chandra observation in the HDF revealed that about 14+11\n\u22127 % of\nI \u2212K > 4 mag. selected EROs are detected in the hard X-ray band and are AGNs (Alexander\net al 2002). We detect 3 AGNs out of 24 EROs with redshifts, which is consistent with the\nX-ray studies. Two of these AGNs have (F 814W \u2212 Ks ) colors of 4.10 and 4.16, and are both\nbulge dominated; the third AGN has an (F 814W \u2212 Ks ) color of 5.25 and disk morphology.\nThe red colors from these three AGNs could be due to a combination of dust extinction and\nthe presence of old stellar populations.\nThe sources observed are in ten different WFPC2 fields (Table 1), each of which is\nslightly less than 160\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 160\u2032\u2032. Among these ten fields, four contain EROs clustered in\nredshift space, likely tracing the high concentration regions of large scale structures. The\ntwo AGNs, u2fq1 128 and u2fq1 389 are at similar redshifts, 1.467 and 1.466. In the u2845\nfield, we find three sources at z \u223c 0.9. One is an ERO, while the other two are serendipitous\ndetections at similar redshifts. In the ufg00 field, a group of three EROs ufg00 083, ufg00 044,\nand ufg00 121, are identified at z \u223c 1.3. All three have [O II] \u03bb3727\u00c5 emission lines, and\ntheir morphologies show clear signatures of recent interactions. In the uim03 field, sources\nuim03 100 and uim03 089 are at z \u223c 1.1. Although these EROs don't necessarily belong to\nclusters of galaxies at z \u223c 1, they are clearly situated in high density environments. These\nsources do not show a preference for any morphological or spectral types. The magnitudes,\ncolors, morphologies, and spectral properties presented in this paper and Paper I suggest\nthat the K-selected EROs are probably massive, luminous systems at z \u223c 1. These systems\ntend to be strongly clustered, tracing peaks of the mass density field, as found by other wide\nfield surveys (Daddi et al. 2000a; McCarthy et al. 2002; Roche et al. 2002).\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\n4.\n\nSummary\n\nWe obtained deep spectroscopic observations for 36 sources among the original 115\nEROs, which were selected in Paper I with (F 814W \u2212Ks ) > 4m and have a mean Ks \u223c18.m 7.\nThe major conclusion of Paper I is that a large fraction of EROs (64%) are disks or disk\ndominated galaxies, while only 30% have bulge or bulge dominated morphologies. Of the\n36 spectroscopic targets, we were able to determine redshifts for 22 sources. We found that\nhalf of the redshift sample have [O II] \u03bb3727\u00c5 emission, while the remaining half are pure\nabsorption line systems. The two broad spectral classes (emission versus absorption line)\nhave an equal mix of bulge and disk dominated galaxies. If we include the sources without\nredshifts (the total sample of 36), the fractions of emission line and the pure absorption line\nsystems are 1/3 respectively. It appears that the spectral class does not have a simple, direct\ncorrespondence with the morphological type. Detecting [O II] \u03bb3727\u00c5 emission in 50% of\nthe redshift sample implies that recent star forming activity is fairly common among the\nEROs. However, we found that although 50% of the sample have star formation, there are\nsignificant populations of old stars in the majority of the sample. This is supported by the\nevidence that a large fraction of the spectra (19/22) in our sample not only have very red\ncontinua, but also absorption features which are indicative of old stars. Only three EROs\nhave pure emission line spectra, with no significant absorption. They are the most likely\ncandidates for dusty starbursts.\nThe results from this paper and Paper I have significant implications for the theories of\ngalaxy formation and evolution. First, the strong ERO clustering measured by recent wide\nfield near-IR surveys (McCarthy et al. 2001; Daddi et al. 2000a) are generally interpreted\nas the evidence that EROs selected by a single optical/near-IR color are the progenitors\nof present-day ellipticals. However, our detailed studies using HST/WFPC2 images and\nKeck spectroscopy show that the properties of these EROs are fairly complex; a significant\nfraction of EROs have disks and/or signs of mergers/interactions. For these EROs to evolve\nto present-day ellipticals, major mergers would be required in order to re-distribute old stars,\nand consume all the gas in the disks on a time scale of a few billion years (from z \u223c 1 to the\npresent-day) (Kormendy & Sanders 1992; Shioya & Bekki 1998). This implies that most of\nthe EROs would still need to go through a starburst phase. Sensitive far infrared observations\nfrom SIRTF will be very useful to measure the volume densities of dusty starbursts between\nz \u223c 1 and the present-day. This will allow us to draw more quantitative connections among\nEROs, dusty starbursts and the present-day early-type galaxies.\nSecond, the fraction of isolated, passively evolving old stellar populations at z \u223c 1 is\nsmall, roughly 10\u221215%. Clearly the generic scenario, where massive ellipticals are rapidly\nformed at high redshifts (Eggen, Lynden-Bell & Sandage 1962) and then evolve passively,\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\nshould be limited to only a small fraction of the entire early-type galaxy population. Previous\nmeasurements of the number density of pure passively evolving old stellar populations based\non a single color selection or optical spectroscopic classification (Daddi, Cimatti & Renzini,\nA. 2000b) are probably over-estimated.\nThe rest-frame J-band luminosity function derived from our sample suggests that the\nluminosity evolution between EROs at z \u223c 1 and the present-day massive galaxies is probably\nnot very large. More accurate measurements would require a larger and more complete\nredshift sample with high resolution images from HST. There exists several deep and large\ndatasets useful for this. A complete redshift survey of these datasets would provide important\ninformation for understanding the nature of the EROs.\n\n5.\n\nAcknowledgment\n\nWe thank Daniel Stern for his generous help and providing his software for the LRIS\ndata reduction.
