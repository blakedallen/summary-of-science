The aim of this work is to derive clear\nnights for the satellite infrared channels and to verify the results using ground-based\nobservations. At La Palma we found a mean percentage of clear nights of 62.6 per\ncent from ground-based data and 71.9 per cent from satellite-based data. Taking into\naccount the fraction of common nights we found a concordance of 80.7 per cent of\nclear nights for ground- and satellite-based data. At Mt.Graham, we found a 97 per\ncent agreement between Columbine heliograph and night-time observing log. From\nColumbine heliograph and the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer-Ozone Monitoring\nInstrument (TOMS-OMI) satellite, we found that about 45 per cent of nights were\nclear, while satellite data (GOES, TOMS) are much more dispersed than those of La\nPalma. Setting a statistical threshold, we retried a comparable seasonal trend between\nheliograph and satellite.\nKey words: Atmospheric effects \u2013 Site testing \u2013 Statistical.\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe identification and characterization of a site for the future European Large Telescope (E-ELT) is a key issue. Moreover a quantitative survey of cloud cover for the areas selected as candidate sites for the telescope is and will continue to be an essential part of the process of site selection\nfor future large telescopes in the same class as the E-ELT.\nIn fact, the performance of large telescopes at optical\nand infra-red wavelengths is critically dependent on atmospheric cloud cover. Cloud cover is a key parameter at the\ntime of site selection and also affects scientific output during\nthe life of the telescope. For instance, a night-time seasonal\ntrend of fewer clear sky can reduce regular access to the sky.\nTypically it is possible to quantify the presence of clouds\nat telescope sites using ground-based observations that provide a real time knowledge of the atmospheric condition. The\nfraction of clear sky can be determined using either instruments (i.e all-sky cameras) or observer estimates. Long-term\nrecords from many ground-based telescopes, which list the\nnumber of nights available for observing, are now accessi-\n\n\u22c6\n\nE-mail:ylenia.maruccia@studio.unibo.it\n\nble and it is possible to begin a reliable statistical study.\nHowever, this technique alone is not suitable for identifying\nfuture candidate sites where there are no telescopes.\nAn easy evolution of this analysis is the use of meteorological satellites that provide measurements of cloud cover\nand other critical parameters for site testing covering large\nareas with different spatial and temporal resolution. Taking into account that, most of the meteorological satellites\nare equipped with similar instrumentation, it is not difficult\nto compare distinct sites observed by two or more different satellites. Additionally, since satellite data archives now\ncover long time periods, it is possible to have for each site\nthe trend of these parameters in both long and short time\nscale. Erasmus and Sarazin (2002) were among the first to\ndemonstrate the successful application of satellite data for\nmonitoring, comparison and forecasting evaluations. Erasmus and van Rooyen (2006) quantified cloud cover at La\nPalma using Meteosat satellite and validating them using\nthe ground based measurements taken at Carlsberg Meridian Telescope (CMT).\nIn this paper we present the results of a study of cloud\ncover using satellite- and ground-based data obtained in two\ndifferent important astronomical sites: the Observatorio del\n\n\f2\n\nA. della Valle et al.\nTable 1.

The results are compared with Erasmus\nand van Rooyen (2002) and Erasmus and Sarazin (2006).\nThe present paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we\ndescribe both the ground and satellite data bases adopted.\nIn Section 3, we describe the satellite data acquisition procedure, and in Section 4 we show the data reduction procedure.\nSection 5 gives a discussion of the results.\n\n2\n\nDATA\n\nThe primary aim of this work is to derive the number of\nclear nights. To quantify the amount of clear sky over ORM\nand Mt.Graham sites we used different set of data collected\nat both ground and satellite facilities available partially via\nWorld Wide Web and partially thanks to the courtesy of\nthe observatory staff. The validation of satellite data are\nalso performed via correlations between ground-based and\nsatellite-based data. In particular we used meteorological\nsatellites that have geostationary orbits because these ensure\nlarge coverage of the globe and a suitable resolution. Fig. 1\nshows the time coverage of the data bases used.\n2.1\n\nGround-based data\n\nThe first detailed analysis of more than 10 yr of meteorological data obtained using the TNG meteorological station at\nORM, can be found in the following two papers: Lombardi\net al. (2006) (hereafter Paper I) and Lombardi et al. (2007)\n(hereafter Paper II). Paper I shows a complete analysis of\nthe vertical temperature gradients and their correlation with\nthe astronomical seeing. In contrast, Paper II shows an analysis of the correlation between wind and astronomical pa-\n\nYear\n\nAnnual mean down time\n(per cent)\n\n2000\n2000\n2000\n2000\n2000\n2000\n2000\n2000\n2000\n\n26.7\n26.6\n26.1\n28.2\n37.3\n39.4\n30.2\n26.4\n29.6\n\nrameters as well as the overall long-term weather conditions\nat ORM. Differences in the microclimate at the ORM have\nbeen demonstrated in a detailed comparison between synoptic parameters taken at three different locations at the\nobservatory on a spatial scale of about 1 km. Moreover, the\nORM is shown to be almost dominated by high pressure\nand characterized by an averaged relative humidity lower\nthan 50 per cent. The first detailed reports on night-time\ncloudiness at La Palma were given by Murdin (1985), who\nreported 78 per cent of nights at La Palma were usable during the period of 1975 February-September (see his Table 2\nin Murdin 1985).\nThanks to the kindness of the staff at the TNG and LBT\nstaff, the updated end-of-night report have been available\nallowing us to extend the time baseline to the range 19752008 for the TNG telescope. The LBT logbook, available\nfrom National Institute for Astrophysics (INAF) and Max\nPlanck Institute time, is only available since 2008 and this\ngives a time baseline only for two years.\nFig. 2 shows the distribution of the mean monthly values for nights lost as a result of bad weather (i.e. cloudy\nnights or with strong wind or nights affected by the calima) for 2007 (long dashed line) and 2008 (short dashed\nline), derived from the first analysis of the TNG logbook.\nThe continuum line of Fig. 2 shows the monthly mean value\ncomputed from 2000 to 2008. It is evident that June is the\nmonth that has the minimum number of bad nights. The\nmaximum number of nights lost as a result of the weather\ndoes not reach 50 per cent of the total allocate nights. Table\n1 reports the annual mean values of the downtime computed\nfrom 2000 to 2008. We can see that the mean value is almost\nstable in these last nine years, giving a value of 30 per cent\nof lost nights.\nWe have also analyzed for the two years 2007 and 2008\nall the astronomical useful nights at TNG using two different\ncriteria. In the first criterion we extracted the information\nfrom the lost time weather string reported in the end-ofnight report. If the night was fully used, no lost time should\nbe found in this string. Using this information, we separated\nthe nights used into fully useful nights (i.e. the dome is open\nthe whole night) and partially useful nights (i.e. less than 5\nh are lost because of the weather). The results are given in\nTable 2. As discussed in the following, the adopted criterion\nis more stringent than that of Arderberg (1983).\nFrom Table 2 it can be seen that the TNG telescope\nis opened for the whole night and without interruptions for\nmore than 50 per cent of all the nights considered.

The continuum line shows the mean\ndowntime computed for 2000-2008.\n\ncompute the mean percentage of the two years, considering\nboth totally and partially useful nights, we find that the telescope operated the 70.8 per cent of the total nights. We can\nconclude that this value is in agreement with the values expected for good astronomical sites. Erasmus and van Rooyen\n(2006) gave a percentage of 74.7 per cent for usable nights at\nCerro Tololo Inter-Americn Observatoy for the period 1997\nJune to 1999 April, derived from ground-based observations.\nMoreover, at the ORM, Arderberg (1983) measured 47 per\ncent of nights to be photometric in 1982 and 67 per cent in\n1983. In his analysis, Arderberg defined as photometric every night having at least six hours of uninterrupted clear sky.\nThe mean value of 57 per cent of photometric nights, computed in 1982 and 1983 by Arderberg (1983) is in agreement\nwith our mean value of 51.7 per cent, obtained using the\nmore restricted criterion of 100 per cent fully used nights.\n\nThis means that in case of six consecutive hours of clear\nsky, a full night is very likely to be photometric according\nto Arderberg's definition.\nIn the second criterion, we classified the nights using the\nsky condition comments. We classified the nights as clear (i.e.\ncloud-free) and mixed (i.e. partially used because of the presence of clouds during the night). We also took into account\nthe calima. In this type of selection, if the night presents\nstrong wind or humidity, it appears mixed in our classification, while it may appear not usable using the previous\ncriterion because the dome may be closed for safety. Table\n3 shows the mean monthly percentage obtained. A comparison between Table 2 and Table 3 shows that the percentage\nof fully used nights is similar to the percentage of 100 per\ncent clear nights. This means that when a night is fully used\nit is very likely to be completely clear. However, table 3 gives\na higher number of total usable nights. This is probably because, as we have just said, the mixed sky conditions may\ninclude also strong wind or humidity conditions. We notice\nthat a 14.5 per cent of nights in 2008 were lost as a result\nof high humidity or strong wind.\nThe same classification has been done for LBT telescope. Table 4 shows the distribution obtained for the quality of nights. The LBT logbook is limited to a sample of\nonly 50 nights (July and August do not have data because\nthe telescope is closed due to the monsoon), but for the\ncompleteness of the discussion we decided to collect them in\nTable 4. A comparison between Table 3 and Table 4 shows\na comparable percentage of clear days, while at Mt.Graham\nthe percentage of mixed nights is higher. Unlikely to La\nPalma site, no calima events has been found at Mt.Graham.\nThe criterion to discriminate between photometric and\nspectroscopic is not unique. It is difficult, for example, to\njudge at the beginning of the night before starting the observations whether the sky is completely clear, in sense of\nclouds free, or whether the airborne dust will significantly\naffect the observing conditions. For this specific point, we\nused the CMT extinction files to set the clear sky quality at\nLa Palma site.\nRegarding Mt.Graham, an interesting criterion was\nused, based instead on the morning sky conditions (Steward\nObservatory, 1987), but is not used in this analysis.

However, when clouds are\npresent they behave as absorbing and emitting \"surfaces\" so\nthat, under these conditions, radiation reaching the satellite\nis from the cloud top, which has a lower emissivity as a result\nof a lower temperature.\nThe GOES data have the highest spatial resolution\n(4 km \u00d7 4 km for channel b4 and 8 km \u00d7 8 km for channel b3) compared with the old generation satellites. Data\nare prepared by the Comprehensive Large Array-data Stewardship System (CLASS), an electronic library of NOAA\nenvironmental data3 , and are stored as rectified full earth\ndisk images in a format called AREA files. We processed\nthem using McIDAS-V Version 1.0beta1, a free visualization and data analysis software package. The first step to\ncollect data was to extract the right sector centered close to\nthe TNG and LBT.\nRegarding the TNG, we know that it has latitude\n28\u25e6 45\u2032 28.3\" N and longitude 17\u25e6 53\u2032 37.9\" W. We identified\nand extracted from the sector a subimage of 1\u25e6 \u00d7 1\u25e6 having the central pixel centered on (or near) the TNG coordinates. We obtained sub-images having the central pixel\nof 28\u25e6 46\u2032 32.16\" N latitude and 17\u25e6 52\u2032 0.84\" W longitude.\nBoth the TNG and subimage coordinates reside in the same\npixel that is also the instrumental resolution. For each night\nwe took into account available observations at four different hours to cover the entire observed night, at 20:45, 23:45,\n02:45 and 05:45 UTC. The mean of these four values has\nbeen used in our analysis.\nRegarding Mt.Graham, data from 1995 January to 2008\nDecember have been analysed: until 2003 April, the data\ncome from GOES 8, and then GOES 12 has been used. For\neach night we selected data at two different hours: at 17.45\nand 02.45 UTC (10:45 and 19:45 of local time, respectively).\nWhen no data was available at those time, we used images\ntaken at different times, up to 1.5 h after or before. Our aim\nwas to select two hourly sets of data, one during daytime\nand one during night-time. However, it was not possible to\nbuilt homogeneous series at 05:45 or 08:45 UTC (22:45 and\n01:45 of local time, respectively) because during spring and\nautumn the GOES change acquisition timetable and do not\noften cover these times.\nThe analogous data base has been extracted for LBT,\nlocated at 32\u25e6 42\u2032 33.2\" N latitude, and 109\u25e6 54\u2032 7.6\" W longitude. We selected subimages with the pixel centered at this\nposition. After a detailed analysis of the GOES daily signal\n\n3\n\nSee www.class.ngdc.noaa.gov\n\nSpatial\nRes.

It is evident that b3\nband (6.7 \u03bcm water vapour) shows higher values of emissivity in the summer time period, corresponding to a higher\ntemperature and a low percentage of clouds (180 \u2212 200 d),\nthan those in the autumn. The lower panel of Fig. 3 for the\n10.7 \u03bcm band shows a flatter distribution of emissivity.\nFig. 4 shows the daily distribution of the emissivity for\nthe b3 and b4 bands at Mt.Graham. The seasonal effects of\nthis site are evident in both the bands, distinguishing the\nmonsoon period. This seasonal trend in b4 band is much\nmore evident than at ORM. This trend requires the normalization of the flux in order to allow a selection of the night\nquality from a predetermined fixed threshold (see later for\ndiscussion). The monsoon period is seen in July and August.\nA spline interpolation was adopted because of the discontinuity of the monsoon period.\n\nFig. 5 shows the distribution of the emissivity in b4\nband ( top) and the distribution of normalized emissivity (\nbottom) centered at Mt.Graham. The normalization function is used to extract the other values of emissivity under\nthe assumption that the behavior is the same all year.\nA comparison of the two Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 shows that the\nsatellite reaches higher values of emissivity in both bands at\nMt.Graham compared to La Palma. A deeper analysis has\nto be carried out to check the existence of correlations with\nother parameters to understood this different value of emissivity between the two sites. In this paper, we have checked\npossible seasonal effects, and Fig. 6 shows the distribution\nof the emissivity at ORM for the b3 (filled squares) and b4\n(open triangles) bands in two different periods of the year.\nThe upper panel of Fig. 6 shows the distribution of three\nconsecutive days (clear, mixed and cloudy) in winter time.\nThe clear day reaches a value of about 14000 units in b4\nband and a mean value of about 9700 units in the cloudy\nday. The presence of cold cirrus produces the oscillation of\nthe counts in cloudy day. A similar behavior can be seen in\nb3 band with a lower value of counts. The bottom panel of\nFig. 6 shows the distribution of two consecutive days in summer time (only clear and cloudy because we found no mixed\nand consecutive day). We see that the clear day reaches a\nvalue of about 16000 units in b4 band a greater value with\nrespect the winter value, probably because of the different\nmean air temperature. A more evident effect of the arriving perturbation can be seen in b3 band with a drop of the\ncounts.\nTo meke an easy comparison of the seasonal behavior of\nthe two sites, we include here the analogous distribution for\nMt.Graham. Fig. 7 shows the distribution of b3 (triangles)\nand b4 (squares) bands of GOES 12 satellite during some\nwinter (upper panel) and summer (lower panel) days in 2008,\ncompared with the temperature of the air measured by the\n\n\fClear sky fraction analysis\n\n7\n\n15\n15000\n\n10000\n\n5\n0\n\n5000\n-5\n\nAir Temperature (\u00b0C)\n\nGOES emissivity\n\n10\n\nClear\nMixed\nCloudy\n0\n-10\n01/02 12:00 02/02 12:00 03/02 12:00 04/02 12:00\nTime\n25\n20\n15\n15000\n10\n5\n\n10000\n\n0\n\nAir Temperature (\u00b0C)\n\nGOES emissivity\n\n20000\n\nClear\nCloudy\nClear\n5000\n-5\n03/06 12:00 04/06 12:00 05/06 12:00 06/06 12:00\nTime\nFigure 6.

We confirm that the signal from La Palma is systematically lower\nthan Mt.Graham, in spite of the lower altitude. A tentative explanation could be a higher extinction of the satellite\nsignal because of the longer of optical path.\nFig. 7 clearly shows the difficulty in finding the right\nthreshold of GOES fluxes. When the day (and night) is clear,\nair temperature and b4 band values follow a day/night cycle.\nWhen a perturbation arrives, the daily peak usually disappears. However, the winter graphic shows a peak of b4 band\nflux during the night, even if the air temperature remains\nstable. The satellite probably measured the temperature of\nthe clouds,which in that case had a greater temperature than\nthe ground. Using the threshold method to distinguish clear\ndays from cloudy days, this day would be identified as clear.\nIn our sample, there is only marginal evidence (if any) of\nlower minimum temperatures during covered nights compared to clear nights. The most evident difference, instead,\nis a lower emissivity in the late afternoon just before a cloudy\nnight. The local, ground temperature, may have an important role on GOES measurements. Furthermore the higher\n\nFigure 7.

The astronomer's sky condition string is\nshown at the bottom of the plot (see the text for details).\n\nsignal during the summer does not seem to lead to better\ndiscrimination between clear and cloudy nights. Noise in the\ndata and resolution effects have been tested also comparing\nthe single pixel data to nine-pixels averages during nights\nrecorded from the ground; however, the plots are almost\nidentical. More tests are needed to check the reliability of\nnights time GOES at Mt.Graham.\n\n4.1\n\nLa Palma: the threshold method\n\nConsidering the sky quality comments as derived from the\nend-of-night report at TNG, we correlate the values of b3\nand b4 bands of GOES with the corresponding night quality.\nFig. 8 shows the distribution of the emissivity obtained from\nb3 (x-axis) and b4 (y-axis) bands as a function of the different type of nights for 2007 (filled triangles) and 2008 (open\nsquares). Each type of night is plotted separately to better identify the distribution along the panels. Fig. 8 shows\ngood correlation between TNG classification and emissivity.\nIn fact, it is evident that at higher b3 and b4 band values it\n\n\f8\n\nA. della Valle et al.\n\nFigure 8.

The years 2007 (filled triangles) and 2008 (open squares) are\nplotted.\n\ngenerally corresponds to a clear night, and at lower b3 and\nb4 band values it corresponds to a cloudy night. In contrast,\nmixed nights have a distribution among all the possible values, probably due to the season.\nIn order to have a more objective analysis of clear conditions, we used and cross-correlated the same satellite data\nwith the corresponding atmospheric extinction as published\nin the website of the CAMC telescope4 . In this analysis, we\npresume that sky conditions ( with the two telescope having\na close locations) were the same and extinction parameter\nis able to identify not only useful nights but also the photometric nights. The nightly values of extinction were derived\nfrom CCD frames in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)\nr' band.\nEach frame contains an average of 30 \u2212 40 photometric\nstandard stars. In our analysis, we assumed that if no value\nof extinction existed or if it was equal to zero, it was probable that no observation took place because of the bad sky\nconditions. Nights with technical problems have not been\nincluded (233 nights).\nFig. 9 shows the distribution of the extinction as a function of GOES b3 (upper panel) and b4 (lower panel) band\nemissivity. The points represent all the nights with an extinction value not equal to zero and are classified by extracting information from TNG logbook for 2007 and 2008.\nThey show a large spread of the extinction values in both\ninfrared bands, some of which have been classified as cloudy\nat TNG. Clear nights are located in a well-defined locus of\nthe b4 band. It is interesting to note that 72.1 per cent of all\nthe nights reporting calima on the TNG report in 2007 and\n2008, have extinction values greater then 0.13. Moreover,\nthose nights having reported no calima but some clouds have\nextinction values greater or equal to 0.13 but lower b3 and\nb4 values than the nights with calima. Most of our selected\n4\n\nSee http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/\u223cdwe/SRF/camc extinction.html\n\nFigure 9.

The extinction value of 0.2 mag\nairmass\u22121 on clear nights was found to be discriminant for\ncalima events in a previous paper of Lombardi et al. (2008).\nFig. 10 shows the distribution of the GOES 12 emissivity as a function of TNG night report only for those nights\nnot plotted in Fig. 9 because no extinction value was reported (about 123 nights with \"zero extinction\" classification). We can see that the majority of the plotted points\nare located in the panels marked mixed and cloudy. In fact,\nconsidering the TNG logbook for 2007 and 2008, we found\nthat the 63.4 per cent of these nights with no extinction at\n\n\fClear sky fraction analysis\n\nFigure 10. Emissivity distribution of GOES 12 b3 and b4 band\nemissivity at the ORM in 2007 and 2008 for all the nights with\n\"zero extinction\" classification in the CMT log (no observations).\nSky quality classification has been carried out using the TNG log.\n\nCMT are classified as cloudy or mixed ones, while only the\n36.4 per cent are classified as clear nights or with the calima.\nTo conclude we decided to use Fig. 9 to define the\nthreshold values for both b3 and b4 band to distinguish\nsatellite clear nights from cloudy ones. In particular we decided to obtain the satellite sample of clear nights, setting\nthe GOES threshold to 6500 for b3 band and 13200 for b4\nband. The ground sample is obtained using all the nights\nwith CMT extinction values. The result is shown in Fig. 11\nwhere dashed lines indicate the threshold that we choose to\nseparate clear nights. All GOES nights presents in b3 band\nvalues greater than 6500 and in b4 band values greater than\n13200 are clear, all the nights with b3 band values less than\n6500 and b4 band values less than 13200 are cloudy, and the\nother cases are mixed. This choice has been adopted by optimizing the discrimination of the different nights and minimizing the contamination. It should be noticed that this empirical criterium is different from the method used by Erasmus based, instead, on the derived temperatures. With this\nadopted limits, we obtained the following statistics: GOES\nidentified 73.6 per cent of clear nights for 2008 and 70.2 per\ncent for 2007, while from ground observation we know that\nthe 61.6 per cent of all nights were clear for 2008 and the\n63.6 per cent for 2007. Thus, it seems that, using our GOES\nprocessing method, clear nights are overestimated of about\n10 per cent.\n4.2\n\nMt.Graham: a new approach\n\nFig. 12 shows the results of the same adopted procedure that\ncorrelate nights quality based on LBT report and GOES\nemissivity. The separation between clear, mixed and covered nights on the base of b3 and b4 GOES bands is not as\nevident as la Palma data. This could in part be the result of\n\n9\n\nFigure 11.

The dashed\nlines indicate the thresholds chosen to separate clear nights from\nmixed and cloudy nights.\n\nan intrinsic GOES data interpretation at Mt.Graham, and\nin part a result of poor statistics. In order to improve the\nlatter, after a number of tests, we decided to follow a new different approach using the heliograph data from Columbine\npeak. The archive is maintained by the Western Regional\nClimate Center5 and data are freely downloaded. For the\npurpose of this paper, we downloaded the daily table from\n2001 March (from when the heliograph data are available).\nThis database is not complete: for some days no data were\nrecorded or were only partially recorded; for the first case\nthe event is highlighted, but not the second. So we verified\nthe reliability of the data checking day per day the data base\nand classifying days for completeness: perfects if data covered the entire day, good if only one hour data lacked, bad if\nmore than one hour was not recorded. We found that perfect\ndays make up 64.2 per cent of the total, good 8.7 per cent,\nand bad days 27.1 per cent. We only used perfect and good\ndays in this analysis, covering 72.9 per cent of the considered\nperiod. Fig. 13 shows the distribution of Sun emissivity, as\nintegrated daily fluxes, for 2008, where the bad days appear\nas flux drops.\nThe monsoon period (day 180 to about 240) is evident.\nBecause of the strong seasonal effect, the heliograph data\nhave been normalized like the GOES data using a spline fit.\nFinally the normalized daily fluxes have been compared with\nthe end-of-night reports of LBT. The correlation is presented\nin Fig. 14 where the correspondence of the heliograph flux\nwith the night-time data is very tight, with a concordance of\n97 per cent of clear nights when the threshold of the normal-\n\n5\n\nsee the web page http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/cgi-bin/rawMAIN.pl?azACOL\n\n\f10\n\nA. della Valle et al.\n\nFigure 12.

It is evident that the day/night difference at Mt.Graham is almost negligible if we consider only\nclear days, but not when considering mixed/cloudy days,\nwhere 30 per cent of the samples fall in the other category.\nA similar procedure was used to compare the TOMSOMI reflectivity with the logbook of LBT. In this case the\nbest threshold was found to be 0.08. The results are visible\nin Fig. 15. It is evident that heliograph and TOMS-OMI\ndata distinguish clear nights better than GOES satellites.\n\nFigure 14.

Then we compared both GOES b3 and b4\nnormalized fluxes with the heliograph data. We found two\ndifferent thresholds, where the percentage of clear nights\nfound by GOES was comparable with that obtained with\nTOMS-OMI and the heliograph in the overlapped period.\nThe two values are 0.66 and 0.8 of the b3 and b4 normalized flux respectively for the heliograph and for the TOMS.\n\n5\n5.1\n\nDISCUSSION\nLa Palma site\n\nIn our analysis at La Palma site we used 731 nights obtaining the sky comments from TNG end-of-night reports.\nAfter the cross-correlation of the TNG nights with the CMT\nextinction, the total number of nights used for the final\nstatistics was 375: these we can define photometric or, at\nleast, spectroscopic on the basis of Table 2. We obtained 700\nnights from GOES database, covering the period 2007-2008.\nFig. 11 shows the thresholds adopted to select night quality. All those having emissivity greater than 6500 counts in\nb3 band and a values greater than 13200 counts in b4 band\nare defined as clear nights. In contrast, we defined as cloudy\nall the nights with b3 band values less than 6500 and b4\nband values less than 13200; all other cases are classified as\nmixed. For ground observations, we defined clear nights all\nthose ones with no clouds, humidity, strong wind or calima.\nWith these adopted limits we found a mean statistical\npercentage of clear nights of 62.6 per cent from ground data\nand 71.9 per cent for satellite data. It seems that there is a\nquite good correlation between ground and satellite data,\nbut the satellite overestimates the clear nights by about\n10 per cent, as already found by Erasmus and van Rooyen\n(2006).\nThe next step was to quantify the nights classified as\n\n11\n\nclear using both ground and satellite data. We found that\nthe 79.7 per cent of the common nights (365, i.e. half of the\ntotal sample) are clear for both ground and satellite data for\n2007, and 81.6 per cent for 2008, with a mean percentage of\n80.7 per cent. Table 6 shows the distribution of the monthly\npercentage of the common clear nights at La Palma in the\nyears 2007 and 2008. Moreover we note that most of the\nclear nights have an extinction less than 0.13. Months with\n\"\u2212\" indicate that no data are available from GOES database\nor from CMT extinction file. There is a large spread of the\nagreement during the months and also in the two considered\nyears.\nUsing the Meteosat in geostationary orbit at 0\u25e6 , at\nthe ORM Erasmus and van Rooyen (2006) found 68.7\nper cent of clear nights (i.e. cloud free) from ground\nbased data, on the basis of 629 nights in the period of\n1999-2002, compared with our percentage of 62.6 per cent.\nIn contrast, they found a percentage of 65.0 per cent from\nsatellite data, compared with our mean of 71.9 per cent.\nMoreover, they found 52.5 per cent of photometric nights\nfor both satellite and ground data, a much lower value than\nour mean value of 80.7 per cent. We note that Erasmus\nand van Rooyen (2006) report 83.7 and 85.3 per cent of\nphotometric hours for satellite and ground data, including\nthe time when only part of the sky was photometric. A\nsummary of the number of photometric nights can be found\nat\nwww.otri.iac.es/sitesting/UserFiles/File/photometrictime.pdf .\nInstead, the estimated percentage of spectroscopic\nnights is different. If we assume that the partially used nights\nare spectroscopic, we found from the logbook a mean value\nof about 16.8 per cent. Erasmus and van Rooyen found a\nmean value of 20.7 per cent. Instead, from satellite they\nfound that 23.8 per cent are spectroscopic nights, compared\nwith our result of about 14.5 per cent. Finally, we found\nthat the 31.0 per cent are spectroscopic nights for both the\nsatellite and the ground-based data, compared with 8.3 per\ncent given by Erasmus and van Rooyen.\nFinally, we considered the nights affected by the calima.\nWe found that about 80 per cent of nights affected by the\ncalima are considered clear for GOES, the satellite does not\ndistinguish the calima.\nA test has been carried out to verify if the satellite and\nground data are more in agreement when considering nights\naffected by the calima and the clear nights together, rather\nthan considering only clear nights. Under this assumption,\nwe obtained that the clear nights (i.e. cloudless nights) plus\nnights affected by the calima, are 68.8 per cent for ground\nselection for 2008 (compared with 73.6 per cent for GOES)\nand 73.2 per cent for 2007 (compared with 70.2 per cent\nfor GOES). The mean percentage is 71.0 per cent, showing\na very good agreement between satellite data and groundbased observation. We can conclude that satellite does not\ndistinguish the calima event. Fig. 16 shows this result, where\nthe monthly distribution of the clear night fraction is plotted from TNG and CMT logbooks (dashed line) and GOES\n12 (solid line). The agreement of the two plots is excellent\nexcept for December.\nThe final step was to understand how many nights were\nclear for both ground and satellite data in this database including nights affected by the calima. We found that the\n81.9 per cent of all the clear nights are effectively clear for\n\n\f12\n\nA. della Valle et al.\n\nFigure 16. Composite distribution of clear nights, even if affected by the calima, at La Palma from both ground (dashed line,\nfrom TNG and CMT logbook) and satellite (solid line, GOES\n12) data. The fractions are computed for the subsample of CMT\nnights with extinction values.\n\nboth GOES and ground for 2007 and the 80.3 per cent for\n2008. We found a mean percentage of 81.1 per cent, compared with the previous mean of 80.7 per cent of clear nights\nnot including the calima. It is evident that the percentages\nare similar and this is probably because of the low number of\nnights affected by the calima. We emphasize that the satellite selects clear nights without making assumptions about\nthe transparency of the sky.\n5.2\n\nMt Graham site\n\nAt Mt Graham the total number of clear days analyzed\nin the period 2002-2008 are 912 from the heliograph and\n964 from GOES. The common number of clear days is\n661, with a relative fraction of 72.0 per cent of common\ndays versus the total number of clear days from the heliograph. Fig. 17 shows the monthly composite distribution of the monthly average fraction of clear night computed from the heliograph database, the Toms-Omi satellite,\nGOES data taken at 17:45 and 02:45 UTC (10:45 and 19:45\nlocal time, respectively), data from Mt Graham site testing (Steward Observatory 1987) and the rain distribution\nderived from Safford (Agriculture center) database. With\nthe obvious exception of Mt Graham site testing, all the\ndata are from the period of 2007-2008. There is a general qualitative agreement among the different methods (the\nrainfall is clearly anticorrelated with the clear night fraction) with the heliograph data. A high peak in May is evident, as well the sharp cut-off between May and June,\nand a secondary peak in autumn. This trend is in very\ngood agreement with the Kitt Peak logbooks of photometric\ntime fraction analyzed by D.L.Crawford (Steward Observatory 1987; see also the data of usable time available at\nhttp://www.noao.edu/kpno/usrhnbk/user-App.html). The\nGOES data are higher than the average of the other data in\nSeptember and October and lower in May. While the fraction of usable time (44.5 per cent) is in agreement with the\nother methods, the distribution is clearly more noisy. The\n\nFigure 17. Composite monthly mean distribution of clear nights\nat Mt Graham\n\n1982-1983 site testing data are in a very good agreement\nwith the heliograph data, except during October-December\nwhere these data are much lower. On average the site testing data are lowest. We recall that winter time in Arizona\npresents high variability, connected with the episodic invasions of storms coming from north-west. The resulting yearly\nusable fraction is between 43.0 per cent and 46.0 per cent. It\nshould be noticed that GOES data analysis from Erasmus\n2002 at Mt Graham gives a usable fraction much higher\nthat all our indicators (61.0 per cent clear and 60.0 per cent\nusable), in particular during the monsoon season. This suggests that GOES data interpretation at Mt Graham presents\nsome unresolved multiparametric problems and the results\nare very sensitive to the data treatment. The difficulty in\nthe quantitative interpretation of GOES data is extensively\ndiscussed in literature (Stove et al. 1988, Khyier et al. 2004,\nand Jung et al. 2004).\nFig. 18 shows the long-term yearly composite distribution of the fraction of clear night fraction computed using\nthe heliograph database, the TOMS (OMI, Earth probe and\nNimbus7) satellite data, the GOES 8 and 12 data taken at\nthe 19:45 and 10:45 local time and the rain distribution derived from Safford database. It can be seen as the rain distribution is very well anticorrelated with the distribution of\nthe clear time, in particular with the clear time record in\nthe database of Nimbus-7. A major drop in the fraction of\nclear time occurred between 1982 and 1983, corresponding\nto a sharp rainfall peak. This was also the period of the Mt\nGraham site testing. According to the suggestion discussed\nin the site testing report we confirm that the lower fraction\nreported (and discussed above) was due to a climate fluctuation. A general trend with decreasing rainfall and increase\nof the clear time fraction between 1980 and 2008 can also be\nseen. The year 2008 (in particular the spring) was recorded\nin Arizona as one of the driest of the last fifty years.\n\n\fClear sky fraction analysis\n\n13\n\nthe night time conditions at Mt Graham and possibly also\nin the whole Arizona area.\n\u2022 the limited day/night weather evolution at Mt Graham\nmakes the results of a very simple device as the heliograph,\nuseful to monitor with high accuracy the local status of the\nnight time clear sky.\nIn addition, at la Palma we can derive the following conclusions:\n\u2022 It is possible to define a threshold in satellite emissivity\nto select clear nights with an uncertainty of 20 per cent.\n\u2022 A good correlation exists between GOES 12 satellite\nand ground-based data.\n\u2022 Using the common selected nights we found that 80.7\nper cent are classified clear from both GOES 12 satellite and\nground logbook.\n\u2022 The marginal increase to 81.1 per cent of the concordance obtained including calima events confirm that the\nsatellite is able to distinguish only the presence of clouds.\n\nFigure 18.

The lower plot shows the rainfall yearly distribution\nat Safford.\n\n6\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe have presented a quantitative survey of cloudy coverage\nat la Palma and Mt Graham using both ground and satellite\ndata. In order to quantify the amount of clear nights, we used\ndifferent databases, in particular the end-of-nights reports\nobtained at TNG and LBT telescopes, the CMT extinction\nfile for La Palma and the heliograph and rainfall databases\nat Mt Graham. Satellite data are derived from GOES 12 at\nLa Palma and GOES 8 and 12 at Mt Graham. A further\ncheck have been done only for Mt Graham using the TOMS\nfamily satellites.\nThe analysis mainly addresses the years 2007 and 2008\nbut a long-term analysis is also reported for Mt Graham.\nThe sample at La Palma is composed of 731 consecutive\nnights. After the cross correlation with the extinction file,\nthis is reduced to 365 nights. The analysis at Mt Graham is\nbased on 912 days. The sample from satellite is composed\nof 700 nights at la Palma and 964 at Mt Graham. A fixed\nthreshold in the GOES IR emissivity selects the clear nights\nby satellite. At La Palma we have obtained that 62.6 per cent\nof the 365 sampled nights are selected clear from ground, and\n71.9 per cent of the 365 nights are selected clear from satellite. Taking into account the common nights between ground\nand satellite data we found that 81.1 per cent of the nights\nare selected clear for both. This shows good agreement but\nindicates that about 19 per cent of the clear nights from\nground are lost by the satellite data. At Mt Graham we\nfound a good agreement between Columbine heliograph and\nnight time observing log. In this case, that satellite found\nonly 72.0 per cent of the total of clear days found by the\nheliograph.\nTwo relevant additional conclusions can be derived from\nthe Mt Graham analysis, as follows:\n\u2022 the rainfall trend at Safford can be used as tracer of\n\nA further analysis of the satellite data (e.g.a wider field, the\nsimultaneous use of different channels, etc.) is suggest to\nimprove the prediction of clear nights. Furthermore, we are\nstudying the fraction of clear nights lost for high humidity\nor strong wind.\n\n6.1\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThe authors acknowledge dr.Vincenzo Testa, from National\nInstitute for Astrophysics, Roland Gredel, from Heidelberg\nMax Planck Institute for Astronomy, Antonio Magazzu from\nTNG and the former TNG Director Ernesto Oliva for the\ncollaboration.\nThis activity is supported by the European Community\n(Framework Programme 7, Preparing for the construction of\nthe European Extremely Large Telescope, Grant Agreement\nNumber 211257).\n\nREFERENCES\nArderberg, A., 1983, in Arderberg A. and Woltjer L., eds.,\nProc. of ESO Workshop N.18, Site Testing for Future\nLarge Telescopes.

The aim of this work is to derive clear\nnights for the satellite infrared channels and to verify the results using ground-based\nobservations. At La Palma we found a mean percentage of clear nights of 62.6 per\ncent from ground-based data and 71.9 per cent from satellite-based data. Taking into\naccount the fraction of common nights we found a concordance of 80.7 per cent of\nclear nights for ground- and satellite-based data. At Mt.Graham, we found a 97 per\ncent agreement between Columbine heliograph and night-time observing log. From\nColumbine heliograph and the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer-Ozone Monitoring\nInstrument (TOMS-OMI) satellite, we found that about 45 per cent of nights were\nclear, while satellite data (GOES, TOMS) are much more dispersed than those of La\nPalma. Setting a statistical threshold, we retried a comparable seasonal trend between\nheliograph and satellite.\nKey words: Atmospheric effects \u2013 Site testing \u2013 Statistical.\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe identification and characterization of a site for the future European Large Telescope (E-ELT) is a key issue. Moreover a quantitative survey of cloud cover for the areas selected as candidate sites for the telescope is and will continue to be an essential part of the process of site selection\nfor future large telescopes in the same class as the E-ELT.\nIn fact, the performance of large telescopes at optical\nand infra-red wavelengths is critically dependent on atmospheric cloud cover. Cloud cover is a key parameter at the\ntime of site selection and also affects scientific output during\nthe life of the telescope. For instance, a night-time seasonal\ntrend of fewer clear sky can reduce regular access to the sky.\nTypically it is possible to quantify the presence of clouds\nat telescope sites using ground-based observations that provide a real time knowledge of the atmospheric condition. The\nfraction of clear sky can be determined using either instruments (i.e all-sky cameras) or observer estimates. Long-term\nrecords from many ground-based telescopes, which list the\nnumber of nights available for observing, are now accessi-\n\n\u22c6\n\nE-mail:ylenia.maruccia@studio.unibo.it\n\nble and it is possible to begin a reliable statistical study.\nHowever, this technique alone is not suitable for identifying\nfuture candidate sites where there are no telescopes.\nAn easy evolution of this analysis is the use of meteorological satellites that provide measurements of cloud cover\nand other critical parameters for site testing covering large\nareas with different spatial and temporal resolution. Taking into account that, most of the meteorological satellites\nare equipped with similar instrumentation, it is not difficult to compare distinct sites observed by two or more different satellites. Additionally, since satellite data archives\nnow cover long time periods, it is possible to have for each\nsite the trend of these parameters in both long and short\ntime scale. Erasmus and Sarazin (?) were among the first to\ndemonstrate the successful application of satellite data for\nmonitoring, comparison and forecasting evaluations. Erasmus and van Rooyen (2006) quantified cloud cover at La\nPalma using Meteosat satellite and validating them using\nthe ground based measurements taken at Carlsberg Meridian Telescope (CMT).\nIn this paper we present the results of a study of cloud\ncover using satellite- and ground-based data obtained in two\ndifferent important astronomical sites: the Observatorio del\n\n\f2\n\nA. della Valle et al.\nTable 1.

The results are compared with Erasmus\nand van Rooyen (2006) and Erasmus and Sarazin (?). The\npresent paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe both the ground and satellite data bases adopted. In\nSection 3, we describe the satellite data acquisition procedure, and in Section 4 we show the data reduction procedure.\nSection 5 gives a discussion of the results.\n\n2\n\nDATA\n\nThe primary aim of this work is to derive the number of\nclear nights. To quantify the amount of clear sky over ORM\nand Mt.Graham sites we used different set of data collected\nat both ground and satellite facilities available partially via\nWorld Wide Web and partially thanks to the courtesy of\nthe observatory staff. The validation of satellite data are\nalso performed via correlations between ground-based and\nsatellite-based data. In particular we used meteorological\nsatellites that have geostationary orbits because these ensure\nlarge coverage of the globe and a suitable resolution. Fig. 1\nshows the time coverage of the data bases used.\n2.1\n\nGround-based data\n\nThe first detailed analysis of more than 10 yr of meteorological data obtained using the TNG meteorological station at\nORM, can be found in the following two papers: Lombardi\net al. (2006) (hereafter Paper I) and Lombardi et al. (2007)\n(hereafter Paper II). Paper I shows a complete analysis of\nthe vertical temperature gradients and their correlation with\nthe astronomical seeing. In contrast, Paper II shows an analysis of the correlation between wind and astronomical pa-\n\nYear\n\nAnnual mean down time\n(per cent)\n\n2000\n2000\n2000\n2000\n2000\n2000\n2000\n2000\n2000\n\n26.7\n26.6\n26.1\n28.2\n37.3\n39.4\n30.2\n26.4\n29.6\n\nrameters as well as the overall long-term weather conditions\nat ORM. Differences in the microclimate at the ORM have\nbeen demonstrated in a detailed comparison between synoptic parameters taken at three different locations at the\nobservatory on a spatial scale of about 1 km. Moreover, the\nORM is shown to be almost dominated by high pressure\nand characterized by an averaged relative humidity lower\nthan 50 per cent. The first detailed reports on night-time\ncloudiness at La Palma were given by Murdin (1985), who\nreported 78 per cent of nights at La Palma were usable during the period of 1975 February-September (see his Table 2\nin Murdin 1985).\nThanks to the kindness of the staff at the TNG and LBT\nstaff, the updated end-of-night report have been available\nallowing us to extend the time baseline to the range 19752008 for the TNG telescope. The LBT logbook, available\nfrom National Institute for Astrophysics (INAF) and Max\nPlanck Institute time, is only available since 2008 and this\ngives a time baseline only for two years.\nFig. 2 shows the distribution of the mean monthly values for nights lost as a result of bad weather (i.e. cloudy\nnights or with strong wind or nights affected by the calima) for 2007 (long dashed line) and 2008 (short dashed\nline), derived from the first analysis of the TNG logbook.\nThe continuum line of Fig. 2 shows the monthly mean value\ncomputed from 2000 to 2008. It is evident that June is the\nmonth that has the minimum number of bad nights. The\nmaximum number of nights lost as a result of the weather\ndoes not reach 50 per cent of the total allocate nights. Table\n1 reports the annual mean values of the downtime computed\nfrom 2000 to 2008. We can see that the mean value is almost\nstable in these last nine years, giving a value of 30 per cent\nof lost nights.\nWe have also analyzed for the two years 2007 and 2008\nall the astronomical useful nights at TNG using two different\ncriteria. In the first criterion we extracted the information\nfrom the lost time weather string reported in the end-ofnight report. If the night was fully used, no lost time should\nbe found in this string. Using this information, we separated\nthe nights used into fully useful nights (i.e. the dome is open\nthe whole night) and partially useful nights (i.e. less than 5\nh are lost because of the weather). The results are given in\nTable 2. As discussed in the following, the adopted criterion\nis more stringent than that of Arderberg (1983).\nFrom Table 2 it can be seen that the TNG telescope\nis opened for the whole night and without interruptions for\nmore than 50 per cent of all the nights considered.

The continuum line shows the mean\ndowntime computed for 2000-2008.\n\ncompute the mean percentage of the two years, considering\nboth totally and partially useful nights, we find that the telescope operated the 70.8 per cent of the total nights. We can\nconclude that this value is in agreement with the values expected for good astronomical sites. Erasmus and van Rooyen\n(2006) gave a percentage of 74.7 per cent for usable nights at\nCerro Tololo Inter-Americn Observatoy for the period 1997\nJune to 1999 April, derived from ground-based observations.\nMoreover, at the ORM, Arderberg (1983) measured 47 per\ncent of nights to be photometric in 1982 and 67 per cent in\n1983. In his analysis, Arderberg defined as photometric every night having at least six hours of uninterrupted clear sky.\nThe mean value of 57 per cent of photometric nights, computed in 1982 and 1983 by Arderberg (1983) is in agreement\nwith our mean value of 51.7 per cent, obtained using the\nmore restricted criterion of 100 per cent fully used nights.\n\nThis means that in case of six consecutive hours of clear\nsky, a full night is very likely to be photometric according\nto Arderberg's definition.\nIn the second criterion, we classified the nights using the\nsky condition comments. We classified the nights as clear (i.e.\ncloud-free) and mixed (i.e. partially used because of the presence of clouds during the night). We also took into account\nthe calima. In this type of selection, if the night presents\nstrong wind or humidity, it appears mixed in our classification, while it may appear not usable using the previous\ncriterion because the dome may be closed for safety. Table\n3 shows the mean monthly percentage obtained. A comparison between Table 2 and Table 3 shows that the percentage\nof fully used nights is similar to the percentage of 100 per\ncent clear nights. This means that when a night is fully used\nit is very likely to be completely clear. However, table 3 gives\na higher number of total usable nights. This is probably because, as we have just said, the mixed sky conditions may\ninclude also strong wind or humidity conditions. We notice\nthat a 14.5 per cent of nights in 2008 were lost as a result\nof high humidity or strong wind.\nThe same classification has been done for LBT telescope. Table 4 shows the distribution obtained for the quality of nights. The LBT logbook is limited to a sample of\nonly 50 nights (July and August do not have data because\nthe telescope is closed due to the monsoon), but for the\ncompleteness of the discussion we decided to collect them in\nTable 4. A comparison between Table 3 and Table 4 shows\na comparable percentage of clear days, while at Mt.Graham\nthe percentage of mixed nights is higher. Unlikely to La\nPalma site, no calima events has been found at Mt.Graham.\nThe criterion to discriminate between photometric and\nspectroscopic is not unique. It is difficult, for example, to\njudge at the beginning of the night before starting the observations whether the sky is completely clear, in sense of\nclouds free, or whether the airborne dust will significantly\naffect the observing conditions. For this specific point, we\nused the CMT extinction files to set the clear sky quality at\nLa Palma site.\nRegarding Mt.Graham, an interesting criterion was\nused, based instead on the morning sky conditions (Steward\nObservatory, 1987), but is not used in this analysis.

However, when clouds are\npresent they behave as absorbing and emitting \"surfaces\" so\nthat, under these conditions, radiation reaching the satellite\nis from the cloud top, which has a lower emissivity as a result\nof a lower temperature.\nThe GOES data have the highest spatial resolution\n(4 km \u00d7 4 km for channel b4 and 8 km \u00d7 8 km for channel b3) compared with the old generation satellites. Data\nare prepared by the Comprehensive Large Array-data Stewardship System (CLASS), an electronic library of NOAA\nenvironmental data3 , and are stored as rectified full earth\ndisk images in a format called AREA files. We processed\nthem using McIDAS-V Version 1.0beta1, a free visualization and data analysis software package. The first step to\ncollect data was to extract the right sector centered close to\nthe TNG and LBT.\nRegarding the TNG, we know that it has latitude\n28\u25e6 45\u2032 28.3\" N and longitude 17\u25e6 53\u2032 37.9\" W. We identified\nand extracted from the sector a subimage of 1\u25e6 \u00d7 1\u25e6 having the central pixel centered on (or near) the TNG coordinates. We obtained sub-images having the central pixel\nof 28\u25e6 46\u2032 32.16\" N latitude and 17\u25e6 52\u2032 0.84\" W longitude.\nBoth the TNG and subimage coordinates reside in the same\npixel that is also the instrumental resolution. For each night\nwe took into account available observations at four different hours to cover the entire observed night, at 20:45, 23:45,\n02:45 and 05:45 UTC. The mean of these four values has\nbeen used in our analysis.\nRegarding Mt.Graham, data from 1995 January to 2008\nDecember have been analysed: until 2003 April, the data\ncome from GOES 8, and then GOES 12 has been used. For\neach night we selected data at two different hours: at 17.45\nand 02.45 UTC (10:45 and 19:45 of local time, respectively).\nWhen no data was available at those time, we used images\ntaken at different times, up to 1.5 h after or before. Our aim\nwas to select two hourly sets of data, one during daytime\nand one during night-time. However, it was not possible to\nbuilt homogeneous series at 05:45 or 08:45 UTC (22:45 and\n01:45 of local time, respectively) because during spring and\nautumn the GOES change acquisition timetable and do not\noften cover these times.\nThe analogous data base has been extracted for LBT,\nlocated at 32\u25e6 42\u2032 33.2\" N latitude, and 109\u25e6 54\u2032 7.6\" W longitude. We selected subimages with the pixel centered at this\nposition. After a detailed analysis of the GOES daily signal\n\n3\n\nSee www.class.ngdc.noaa.gov\n\nSpatial\nRes.

It is evident that b3\nband (6.7 \u03bcm water vapour) shows higher values of emissivity in the summer time period, corresponding to a higher\ntemperature and a low percentage of clouds (180 \u2212 200 d),\nthan those in the autumn. The lower panel of Fig. 3 for the\n10.7 \u03bcm band shows a flatter distribution of emissivity.\nFig. 4 shows the daily distribution of the emissivity for\nthe b3 and b4 bands at Mt.Graham. The seasonal effects of\nthis site are evident in both the bands, distinguishing the\nmonsoon period. This seasonal trend in b4 band is much\nmore evident than at ORM. This trend requires the normalization of the flux in order to allow a selection of the night\nquality from a predetermined fixed threshold (see later for\ndiscussion). The monsoon period is seen in July and August.\nA spline interpolation was adopted because of the discontinuity of the monsoon period.\n\nFig. 5 shows the distribution of the emissivity in b4\nband ( top) and the distribution of normalized emissivity (\nbottom) centered at Mt.Graham. The normalization function is used to extract the other values of emissivity under\nthe assumption that the behavior is the same all year.\nA comparison of the two Fig. 3 and Fig. 4 shows that the\nsatellite reaches higher values of emissivity in both bands at\nMt.Graham compared to La Palma. A deeper analysis has\nto be carried out to check the existence of correlations with\nother parameters to understood this different value of emissivity between the two sites. In this paper, we have checked\npossible seasonal effects, and Fig. 6 shows the distribution\nof the emissivity at ORM for the b3 (filled squares) and b4\n(open triangles) bands in two different periods of the year.\nThe upper panel of Fig. 6 shows the distribution of three\nconsecutive days (clear, mixed and cloudy) in winter time.\nThe clear day reaches a value of about 14000 units in b4\nband and a mean value of about 9700 units in the cloudy\nday. The presence of cold cirrus produces the oscillation of\nthe counts in cloudy day. A similar behavior can be seen in\nb3 band with a lower value of counts. The bottom panel of\nFig. 6 shows the distribution of two consecutive days in summer time (only clear and cloudy because we found no mixed\nand consecutive day). We see that the clear day reaches a\nvalue of about 16000 units in b4 band a greater value with\nrespect the winter value, probably because of the different\nmean air temperature. A more evident effect of the arriving perturbation can be seen in b3 band with a drop of the\ncounts.\nTo meke an easy comparison of the seasonal behavior of\nthe two sites, we include here the analogous distribution for\nMt.Graham.

We confirm that the signal from La Palma is systematically lower\nthan Mt.Graham, in spite of the lower altitude. A tentative explanation could be a higher extinction of the satellite\nsignal because of the longer of optical path.\nFig. 7 clearly shows the difficulty in finding the right\nthreshold of GOES fluxes. When the day (and night) is clear,\nair temperature and b4 band values follow a day/night cycle.\nWhen a perturbation arrives, the daily peak usually disappears. However, the winter graphic shows a peak of b4 band\nflux during the night, even if the air temperature remains\nstable. The satellite probably measured the temperature of\nthe clouds,which in that case had a greater temperature than\nthe ground. Using the threshold method to distinguish clear\ndays from cloudy days, this day would be identified as clear.\nIn our sample, there is only marginal evidence (if any) of\nlower minimum temperatures during covered nights compared to clear nights. The most evident difference, instead,\nis a lower emissivity in the late afternoon just before a cloudy\nnight. The local, ground temperature, may have an important role on GOES measurements. Furthermore the higher\n\nFigure 7.

The astronomer's sky condition string is\nshown at the bottom of the plot (see the text for details).\n\nsignal during the summer does not seem to lead to better\ndiscrimination between clear and cloudy nights. Noise in the\ndata and resolution effects have been tested also comparing\nthe single pixel data to nine-pixels averages during nights\nrecorded from the ground; however, the plots are almost\nidentical. More tests are needed to check the reliability of\nnights time GOES at Mt.Graham.\n\n4.1\n\nLa Palma: the threshold method\n\nConsidering the sky quality comments as derived from the\nend-of-night report at TNG, we correlate the values of b3\nand b4 bands of GOES with the corresponding night quality.\nFig. 8 shows the distribution of the emissivity obtained from\nb3 (x-axis) and b4 (y-axis) bands as a function of the different type of nights for 2007 (filled triangles) and 2008 (open\nsquares). Each type of night is plotted separately to better identify the distribution along the panels. Fig. 8 shows\ngood correlation between TNG classification and emissivity.\nIn fact, it is evident that at higher b3 and b4 band values it\n\n\f8\n\nA. della Valle et al.\n\nFigure 8.

The years 2007 (filled triangles) and 2008 (open squares) are\nplotted.\n\ngenerally corresponds to a clear night, and at lower b3 and\nb4 band values it corresponds to a cloudy night. In contrast,\nmixed nights have a distribution among all the possible values, probably due to the season.\nIn order to have a more objective analysis of clear conditions, we used and cross-correlated the same satellite data\nwith the corresponding atmospheric extinction as published\nin the website of the CAMC telescope4 . In this analysis, we\npresume that sky conditions ( with the two telescope having\na close locations) were the same and extinction parameter\nis able to identify not only useful nights but also the photometric nights. The nightly values of extinction were derived\nfrom CCD frames in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS)\nr' band.\nEach frame contains an average of 30 \u2212 40 photometric\nstandard stars. In our analysis, we assumed that if no value\nof extinction existed or if it was equal to zero, it was probable that no observation took place because of the bad sky\nconditions. Nights with technical problems have not been\nincluded (233 nights).\nFig. 9 shows the distribution of the extinction as a function of GOES b3 (upper panel) and b4 (lower panel) band\nemissivity. The points represent all the nights with an extinction value not equal to zero and are classified by extracting information from TNG logbook for 2007 and 2008.\nThey show a large spread of the extinction values in both\ninfrared bands, some of which have been classified as cloudy\nat TNG. Clear nights are located in a well-defined locus of\nthe b4 band. It is interesting to note that 72.1 per cent of all\nthe nights reporting calima on the TNG report in 2007 and\n2008, have extinction values greater then 0.13. Moreover,\nthose nights having reported no calima but some clouds have\nextinction values greater or equal to 0.13 but lower b3 and\nb4 values than the nights with calima. Most of our selected\n4\n\nSee http://www.ast.cam.ac.uk/\u223cdwe/SRF/camc extinction.html\n\nFigure 9.

(2008).\nFig. 10 shows the distribution of the GOES 12 emissivity as a function of TNG night report only for those nights\nnot plotted in Fig. 9 because no extinction value was reported (about 123 nights with \"zero extinction\" classification). We can see that the majority of the plotted points\nare located in the panels marked mixed and cloudy. In fact,\nconsidering the TNG logbook for 2007 and 2008, we found\nthat the 63.4 per cent of these nights with no extinction at\n\n\fClear sky fraction analysis\n\nFigure 10. Emissivity distribution of GOES 12 b3 and b4 band\nemissivity at the ORM in 2007 and 2008 for all the nights with\n\"zero extinction\" classification in the CMT log (no observations).\nSky quality classification has been carried out using the TNG log.\n\nCMT are classified as cloudy or mixed ones, while only the\n36.4 per cent are classified as clear nights or with the calima.\nTo conclude we decided to use Fig. 9 to define the\nthreshold values for both b3 and b4 band to distinguish\nsatellite clear nights from cloudy ones. In particular we decided to obtain the satellite sample of clear nights, setting\nthe GOES threshold to 6500 for b3 band and 13200 for b4\nband. The ground sample is obtained using all the nights\nwith CMT extinction values. The result is shown in Fig. 11\nwhere dashed lines indicate the threshold that we choose to\nseparate clear nights. All GOES nights presents in b3 band\nvalues greater than 6500 and in b4 band values greater than\n13200 are clear, all the nights with b3 band values less than\n6500 and b4 band values less than 13200 are cloudy, and the\nother cases are mixed. This choice has been adopted by optimizing the discrimination of the different nights and minimizing the contamination. It should be noticed that this empirical criterium is different from the method used by Erasmus based, instead, on the derived temperatures. With this\nadopted limits, we obtained the following statistics: GOES\nidentified 73.6 per cent of clear nights for 2008 and 70.2 per\ncent for 2007, while from ground observation we know that\nthe 61.6 per cent of all nights were clear for 2008 and the\n63.6 per cent for 2007. Thus, it seems that, using our GOES\nprocessing method, clear nights are overestimated of about\n10 per cent.\n4.2\n\nMt.Graham: a new approach\n\nFig. 12 shows the results of the same adopted procedure that\ncorrelate nights quality based on LBT report and GOES\nemissivity. The separation between clear, mixed and covered nights on the base of b3 and b4 GOES bands is not as\nevident as la Palma data. This could in part be the result of\n\n9\n\nFigure 11.

The dashed\nlines indicate the thresholds chosen to separate clear nights from\nmixed and cloudy nights.\n\nan intrinsic GOES data interpretation at Mt.Graham, and\nin part a result of poor statistics. In order to improve the\nlatter, after a number of tests, we decided to follow a new different approach using the heliograph data from Columbine\npeak. The archive is maintained by the Western Regional\nClimate Center5 and data are freely downloaded. For the\npurpose of this paper, we downloaded the daily table from\n2001 March (from when the heliograph data are available).\nThis database is not complete: for some days no data were\nrecorded or were only partially recorded; for the first case\nthe event is highlighted, but not the second. So we verified\nthe reliability of the data checking day per day the data base\nand classifying days for completeness: perfects if data covered the entire day, good if only one hour data lacked, bad if\nmore than one hour was not recorded. We found that perfect\ndays make up 64.2 per cent of the total, good 8.7 per cent,\nand bad days 27.1 per cent.

The correlation is presented\nin Fig. 14 where the correspondence of the heliograph flux\nwith the night-time data is very tight, with a concordance of\n97 per cent of clear nights when the threshold of the normal-\n\n5\n\nsee the web page http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/cgi-bin/rawMAIN.pl?azACOL\n\n\f10\n\nA. della Valle et al.\n\nFigure 12.

It is evident that the day/night difference at Mt.Graham is almost negligible if we consider only\nclear days, but not when considering mixed/cloudy days,\nwhere 30 per cent of the samples fall in the other category.\nA similar procedure was used to compare the TOMSOMI reflectivity with the logbook of LBT. In this case the\nbest threshold was found to be 0.08. The results are visible\nin Fig. 15. It is evident that heliograph and TOMS-OMI\ndata distinguish clear nights better than GOES satellites.\n\nFigure 14.

Then we compared both GOES b3 and b4\nnormalized fluxes with the heliograph data. We found two\ndifferent thresholds, where the percentage of clear nights\nfound by GOES was comparable with that obtained with\nTOMS-OMI and the heliograph in the overlapped period.\nThe two values are 0.66 and 0.8 of the b3 and b4 normalized flux respectively for the heliograph and for the TOMS.\n\n5\n5.1\n\nDISCUSSION\nLa Palma site\n\nIn our analysis at La Palma site we used 731 nights obtaining the sky comments from TNG end-of-night reports.\nAfter the cross-correlation of the TNG nights with the CMT\nextinction, the total number of nights used for the final\nstatistics was 375: these we can define photometric or, at\nleast, spectroscopic on the basis of Table 2. We obtained 700\nnights from GOES database, covering the period 2007-2008.\nFig. 11 shows the thresholds adopted to select night quality. All those having emissivity greater than 6500 counts in\nb3 band and a values greater than 13200 counts in b4 band\nare defined as clear nights. In contrast, we defined as cloudy\nall the nights with b3 band values less than 6500 and b4\nband values less than 13200; all other cases are classified as\nmixed. For ground observations, we defined clear nights all\nthose ones with no clouds, humidity, strong wind or calima.\nWith these adopted limits we found a mean statistical\npercentage of clear nights of 62.6 per cent from ground data\nand 71.9 per cent for satellite data. It seems that there is a\nquite good correlation between ground and satellite data,\nbut the satellite overestimates the clear nights by about\n10 per cent, as already found by Erasmus and van Rooyen\n(2006).\nThe next step was to quantify the nights classified as\n\n11\n\nclear using both ground and satellite data. We found that\nthe 79.7 per cent of the common nights (365, i.e. half of the\ntotal sample) are clear for both ground and satellite data for\n2007, and 81.6 per cent for 2008, with a mean percentage of\n80.7 per cent. Table 6 shows the distribution of the monthly\npercentage of the common clear nights at La Palma in the\nyears 2007 and 2008. Moreover we note that most of the\nclear nights have an extinction less than 0.13. Months with\n\"\u2212\" indicate that no data are available from GOES database\nor from CMT extinction file. There is a large spread of the\nagreement during the months and also in the two considered\nyears.\nUsing the Meteosat in geostationary orbit at 0\u25e6 , at\nthe ORM Erasmus and van Rooyen (2006) found 68.7\nper cent of clear nights (i.e. cloud free) from ground\nbased data, on the basis of 629 nights in the period of\n1999-2002, compared with our percentage of 62.6 per cent.\nIn contrast, they found a percentage of 65.0 per cent from\nsatellite data, compared with our mean of 71.9 per cent.\nMoreover, they found 52.5 per cent of photometric nights\nfor both satellite and ground data, a much lower value than\nour mean value of 80.7 per cent. We note that Erasmus\nand van Rooyen (2006) report 83.7 and 85.3 per cent of\nphotometric hours for satellite and ground data, including\nthe time when only part of the sky was photometric. A\nsummary of the number of photometric nights can be found\nat\nwww.otri.iac.es/sitesting/UserFiles/File/photometrictime.pdf .\nInstead, the estimated percentage of spectroscopic\nnights is different. If we assume that the partially used nights\nare spectroscopic, we found from the logbook a mean value\nof about 16.8 per cent. Erasmus and van Rooyen found a\nmean value of 20.7 per cent. Instead, from satellite they\nfound that 23.8 per cent are spectroscopic nights, compared\nwith our result of about 14.5 per cent. Finally, we found\nthat the 31.0 per cent are spectroscopic nights for both the\nsatellite and the ground-based data, compared with 8.3 per\ncent given by Erasmus and van Rooyen.\nFinally, we considered the nights affected by the calima.\nWe found that about 80 per cent of nights affected by the\ncalima are considered clear for GOES, the satellite does not\ndistinguish the calima.\nA test has been carried out to verify if the satellite and\nground data are more in agreement when considering nights\naffected by the calima and the clear nights together, rather\nthan considering only clear nights. Under this assumption,\nwe obtained that the clear nights (i.e. cloudless nights) plus\nnights affected by the calima, are 68.8 per cent for ground\nselection for 2008 (compared with 73.6 per cent for GOES)\nand 73.2 per cent for 2007 (compared with 70.2 per cent\nfor GOES). The mean percentage is 71.0 per cent, showing\na very good agreement between satellite data and groundbased observation. We can conclude that satellite does not\ndistinguish the calima event. Fig. 16 shows this result, where\nthe monthly distribution of the clear night fraction is plotted from TNG and CMT logbooks (dashed line) and GOES\n12 (solid line). The agreement of the two plots is excellent\nexcept for December.\nThe final step was to understand how many nights were\nclear for both ground and satellite data in this database including nights affected by the calima. We found that the\n81.9 per cent of all the clear nights are effectively clear for\n\n\f12\n\nA. della Valle et al.\n\nFigure 16. Composite distribution of clear nights, even if affected by the calima, at La Palma from both ground (dashed line,\nfrom TNG and CMT logbook) and satellite (solid line, GOES\n12) data. The fractions are computed for the subsample of CMT\nnights with extinction values.\n\nboth GOES and ground for 2007 and the 80.3 per cent for\n2008. We found a mean percentage of 81.1 per cent, compared with the previous mean of 80.7 per cent of clear nights\nnot including the calima. It is evident that the percentages\nare similar and this is probably because of the low number of\nnights affected by the calima. We emphasize that the satellite selects clear nights without making assumptions about\nthe transparency of the sky.\n5.2\n\nMt Graham site\n\nAt Mt Graham the total number of clear days analyzed\nin the period 2002-2008 are 912 from the heliograph and\n964 from GOES. The common number of clear days is\n661, with a relative fraction of 72.0 per cent of common\ndays versus the total number of clear days from the heliograph. Fig. 17 shows the monthly composite distribution of the monthly average fraction of clear night computed from the heliograph database, the Toms-Omi satellite,\nGOES data taken at 17:45 and 02:45 UTC (10:45 and 19:45\nlocal time, respectively), data from Mt Graham site testing (Steward Observatory 1987) and the rain distribution\nderived from Safford (Agriculture center) database. With\nthe obvious exception of Mt Graham site testing, all the\ndata are from the period of 2007-2008. There is a general qualitative agreement among the different methods (the\nrainfall is clearly anticorrelated with the clear night fraction) with the heliograph data. A high peak in May is evident, as well the sharp cut-off between May and June,\nand a secondary peak in autumn. This trend is in very\ngood agreement with the Kitt Peak logbooks of photometric\ntime fraction analyzed by D.L.Crawford (Steward Observatory 1987; see also the data of usable time available at\nhttp://www.noao.edu/kpno/usrhnbk/user-App.html). The\nGOES data are higher than the average of the other data in\nSeptember and October and lower in May. While the fraction of usable time (44.5 per cent) is in agreement with the\nother methods, the distribution is clearly more noisy. The\n\nFigure 17. Composite monthly mean distribution of clear nights\nat Mt Graham\n\n1982-1983 site testing data are in a very good agreement\nwith the heliograph data, except during October-December\nwhere these data are much lower. On average the site testing data are lowest. We recall that winter time in Arizona\npresents high variability, connected with the episodic invasions of storms coming from north-west. The resulting yearly\nusable fraction is between 43.0 per cent and 46.0 per cent. It\nshould be noticed that GOES data analysis from Erasmus\n2002 at Mt Graham gives a usable fraction much higher\nthat all our indicators (61.0 per cent clear and 60.0 per cent\nusable), in particular during the monsoon season. This suggests that GOES data interpretation at Mt Graham presents\nsome unresolved multiparametric problems and the results\nare very sensitive to the data treatment. The difficulty in\nthe quantitative interpretation of GOES data is extensively\ndiscussed in literature (Stove et al. 1988, Khyier et al. 2004,\nand Jung et al. 2004).\nFig. 18 shows the long-term yearly composite distribution of the fraction of clear night fraction computed using\nthe heliograph database, the TOMS (OMI, Earth probe and\nNimbus7) satellite data, the GOES 8 and 12 data taken at\nthe 19:45 and 10:45 local time and the rain distribution derived from Safford database. It can be seen as the rain distribution is very well anticorrelated with the distribution of\nthe clear time, in particular with the clear time record in\nthe database of Nimbus-7. A major drop in the fraction of\nclear time occurred between 1982 and 1983, corresponding\nto a sharp rainfall peak. This was also the period of the Mt\nGraham site testing. According to the suggestion discussed\nin the site testing report we confirm that the lower fraction\nreported (and discussed above) was due to a climate fluctuation. A general trend with decreasing rainfall and increase\nof the clear time fraction between 1980 and 2008 can also be\nseen. The year 2008 (in particular the spring) was recorded\nin Arizona as one of the driest of the last fifty years.\n\n\fClear sky fraction analysis\n\n13\n\nthe night time conditions at Mt Graham and possibly also\nin the whole Arizona area.\n\u2022 the limited day/night weather evolution at Mt Graham\nmakes the results of a very simple device as the heliograph,\nuseful to monitor with high accuracy the local status of the\nnight time clear sky.\nIn addition, at la Palma we can derive the following conclusions:\n\u2022 It is possible to define a threshold in satellite emissivity\nto select clear nights with an uncertainty of 20 per cent.\n\u2022 A good correlation exists between GOES 12 satellite\nand ground-based data.\n\u2022 Using the common selected nights we found that 80.7\nper cent are classified clear from both GOES 12 satellite and\nground logbook.\n\u2022 The marginal increase to 81.1 per cent of the concordance obtained including calima events confirm that the\nsatellite is able to distinguish only the presence of clouds.\n\nFigure 18.

The lower plot shows the rainfall yearly distribution\nat Safford.\n\n6\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe have presented a quantitative survey of cloudy coverage\nat la Palma and Mt Graham using both ground and satellite\ndata. In order to quantify the amount of clear nights, we used\ndifferent databases, in particular the end-of-nights reports\nobtained at TNG and LBT telescopes, the CMT extinction\nfile for La Palma and the heliograph and rainfall databases\nat Mt Graham. Satellite data are derived from GOES 12 at\nLa Palma and GOES 8 and 12 at Mt Graham. A further\ncheck have been done only for Mt Graham using the TOMS\nfamily satellites.\nThe analysis mainly addresses the years 2007 and 2008\nbut a long-term analysis is also reported for Mt Graham.\nThe sample at La Palma is composed of 731 consecutive\nnights. After the cross correlation with the extinction file,\nthis is reduced to 365 nights. The analysis at Mt Graham is\nbased on 912 days. The sample from satellite is composed\nof 700 nights at la Palma and 964 at Mt Graham. A fixed\nthreshold in the GOES IR emissivity selects the clear nights\nby satellite. At La Palma we have obtained that 62.6 per cent\nof the 365 sampled nights are selected clear from ground, and\n71.9 per cent of the 365 nights are selected clear from satellite. Taking into account the common nights between ground\nand satellite data we found that 81.1 per cent of the nights\nare selected clear for both. This shows good agreement but\nindicates that about 19 per cent of the clear nights from\nground are lost by the satellite data. At Mt Graham we\nfound a good agreement between Columbine heliograph and\nnight time observing log. In this case, that satellite found\nonly 72.0 per cent of the total of clear days found by the\nheliograph.\nTwo relevant additional conclusions can be derived from\nthe Mt Graham analysis, as follows:\n\u2022 the rainfall trend at Safford can be used as tracer of\n\nA further analysis of the satellite data (e.g.a wider field, the\nsimultaneous use of different channels, etc.) is suggest to\nimprove the prediction of clear nights. Furthermore, we are\nstudying the fraction of clear nights lost for high humidity\nor strong wind.\n\n6.1\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThe authors acknowledge dr.Vincenzo Testa, from National\nInstitute for Astrophysics, Roland Gredel, from Heidelberg\nMax Planck Institute for Astronomy, Antonio Magazzu from\nTNG and the former TNG Director Ernesto Oliva for the\ncollaboration.\nThis activity is supported by the European Community\n(Framework Programme 7, Preparing for the construction of\nthe European Extremely Large Telescope, Grant Agreement\nNumber 211257).\n\nREFERENCES\nArderberg, A., 1983, in Arderberg A. and Woltjer L., eds.,\nProc. of ESO Workshop N.18, Site Testing for Future\nLarge Telescopes.
