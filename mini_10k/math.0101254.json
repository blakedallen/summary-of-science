Introduction\nn\n\nLet M \u2282 P be a nonsingular projective variety acted on by a connected complex\nreductive group G = K C via a homomorphism G \u2192 GL(n + 1) which is the complexification of a homomorphism K \u2192 U (n + 1). Geometric invariant theory (GIT)\ngives us a recipe to form a quotient \u03c6 : M ss \u2192 M//G of the set of semistable points\nand many interesting spaces in algebraic geometry are constructed in this manner\n[MFK94]. But often this quotient is singular and hence intersection cohomology\nwith middle perversity is an important topological invariant. The purpose of this\npaper is to present a way to compute the middle perversity intersection cohomology\nof the singular quotients.\nThe choice of an embedding M \u2282 Pn provides us with a moment map for the\nK-action and the Morse stratification of M with respect to its norm square is Kequivariantly perfect, with the unique open dense stratum M ss [Kir84]. Hence one\n\u2217\ncan compute the Betti numbers for the equivariant cohomology HK\n(M ss ) as well\nas the cup product, at least in principle. See also [Kir92].\nWhen G acts locally freely on M ss , we get an orbifold M//G = M ss /G and\nH \u2217 (M ss ) \u223c\n= H \u2217 (M//G) \u223c\n= IH \u2217 (M//G).\nK\n\nHence this equivariant Morse theory enables us to compute the cohomology ring of\nthe orbifold quotient.\nHowever, if the G action on M ss is not locally free, then M//G has more serious\nsingularities than finite quotient singularities. In general, the induced homomor\u2217\nphism H \u2217 (M//G) \u2192 HK\n(M ss ), which comes from the quotient map\n\u03c6K : EK \u00d7K M ss \u2192 M//G,\nis neither injective nor surjective. Furthermore, the natural map from the ordinary cohomology H \u2217 (M//G) to the intersection cohomology IH \u2217 (M//G) due to\nGoresky and MacPherson [GM80, GM83] is neither injective nor surjective. Hence,\n\u2217\nknowledge of the equivariant cohomology HK\n(M ss ) does not directly enable us to\ncompute the topological invariants for M//G.\nIn [Kir85], Kirwan invented a method to partially desingularize M//G by blowing\nup M ss systematically. When the set of stable points M s is nonempty, she used\nthis process to define a map, which we call the Kirwan map\n\u2217\nss\n\u2217\n\u03bass\nM : HK (M ) \u2192 IH (M//G)\n\nand then to provide an algorithm for the computation of the Betti numbers of\nIH \u2217 (M//G). See [Kir86a] for the Betti number computation of the moduli space of\nDate: March 2003.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nYOUNG-HOON KIEM\n\nrank 2 holomorphic vector bundles over a Riemann surface. However, this method\ndoes not give us any information on the intersection pairing of IH \u2217 (M//G) which\nis also an essential topological invariant.\nIn this paper, we construct a natural injection\n(1.1)\n\n\u2217\n\u03c6\u2217K : IH \u2217 (M//G) \u2192 HK\n(M ss )\n\nunder an assumption, named the almost balanced condition (Definition 5.1). This\nhomomorphism is the right inverse of the Kirwan map above (Proposition 6.2).\nIt is well-known that intersection cohomology is contravariant only for some\nlimited classes of maps. One of the most general known conditions for a subanalytic\nmap\nf :X\u2192Y\nbetween subanalytic pseudo-manifolds to induce a contravariant homomorphism\nf \u2217 : IH \u2217 (Y ) \u2192 IH \u2217 (X)\nby pulling back cycles is the placid condition introduced in [GM85]: The map f is\nplacid if Y has a stratification such that for each stratum S of Y , we have\ncodim S \u2264 codim f \u22121 (S).\nWith this condition, the pull-back of an allowable cycle is again allowable and hence\nwe get the desired homomorphism f \u2217 .\nFurthermore, when there is a compact Lie group K acting on X and f is invariant, we have a homomorphism\n\u2217\n\u2217\nfK\n: IH \u2217 (Y ) \u2192 IHK\n(X)\n\nunder the placid condition because EK \u00d7K X can be approximated by a sequence\nof finite dimensional pseudo-manifolds (see \u00a72.5).\nMore generally, if we have\n(1.2)\n\nq(codim S) \u2264 p(codim f \u22121 (S))\n\nfor some perversities p and q, then the pull-back of cycles gives us a homomorphism\nf \u2217 : IHq\u2217 (Y ) \u2192 IHp\u2217 (X).\nWe call (1.2) the (p, q)-placid condition.\n\u2217\nIn our case, M ss is smooth and hence HK\n(M ss ) is isomorphic to the equivariant\nintersection cohomology\n\u2217\nIHp,K\n(M ss )\nfor any perversity p. Hence if \u03c6 is (p, m)-placid, we get a homomorphism\n\u2217\n\u03c6\u2217K : IH \u2217 (M//G) \u2192 HK\n(M ss ).\n\nObviously the most general condition is obtained when p is the top perversity t.\nHence, when \u03c6 is (t, m)-placid, we obtain the natural homomorphism (1.1).\nBecause \u03c6\u2217K is defined by pulling back cycles, we can deduce that the intersection\npairing is preserved in the following sense: for \u03b1, \u03b2 of complementary degrees in\nIH \u2217 (M//G), i.e. deg \u03b1 + deg \u03b2 = dim M//G, we have\n(1.3)\n\n\u03c6\u2217K (\u03b1) \u222a \u03c6\u2217K (\u03b2) = h\u03b1, \u03b2i\u03c6\u2217K (\u03c4 )\n\nwhere \u03c4 is the top degree class represented by a point. Hence, we can compute\nthe intersection numbers in terms of the cup product structure of the equivariant\ncohomology.\n\n\fINTERSECTION COHOMOLOGY OF QUOTIENTS OF NONSINGULAR VARIETIES\n\n3\n\nBy the local model theorem (Lemma 4.1 and Proposition 4.2) from [SL91], we\ncan describe a topological stratification of M ss and M//G explicitly and compute\nthe codimensions of strata in terms of the weight distributions of the actions of the\nstabilizer subgroups on the symplectic slices. By the results of [Kir84], we will see\nin \u00a75 that the (t, m)-placid condition is in fact a condition on the balancedness of\nthe weight distributions. This is our almost balanced condition.\nSuppose now the almost balanced condition is satisfied. Then by (1.1) and (1.3),\nthe middle perversity intersection cohomology of M//G is completely determined\nas a graded vector space with non-degenerate intersection pairing if we can identify\n\u2217\nthe image of \u03c6\u2217K in HK\n(M ss ).\nIn the light of Deligne's construction of intersection cohomology sheaf, it seems\nreasonable to expect that the answer should be obtained by \"truncating locally\"\nalong each stratum. But complications arise when various strata intersect. To\ncontrol the complications, we require that the submanifolds of M fixed by subgroups\nof G also satisfy the almost balanced condition. We call it the weakly balanced\ncondition (Definition 7.1). When this condition is satisfied, we can identify the\n\u2217\n\u2217\nimage of \u03c6\u2217K as a subspace VM\nof HK\n(M ss ) obtained by truncation. See Definition\n\u2217\n7.5 and (7.6). By computing the dimension of VM\n, we get the intersection Betti\nnumbers without going through the desingularization process as in [Kir86b, Kir86a].\nOne can furthermore compute the Hodge numbers since both \u03c6\u2217K and \u03bass\nM preserve\nthe Hodge structure.\nThe weakly balanced condition is satisfied by many interesting spaces including\nthe moduli spaces of holomorphic vector bundles over a Riemann surface for any\nrank and degree. (See Proposition 7.4.) Also we demonstrate the computations of\n\u2217\nVM\nfor some standard examples in \u00a79.\nThe layout of this paper is as follows. In section 2, we recall the sheaf theoretic\ndefinition of intersection cohomology while in section 3 we show that intersection\ncohomology is functorial with respect to (p, q)-placid maps. The stratification of\na symplectic reduction is discussed in section 4 and the homomorphism \u03c6\u2217K is\nconstructed in section 5 after defining the almost balanced condition. In section 6\nwe recall the Kirwan map and prove that \u03c6\u2217K is the right inverse of \u03bass\nM . In section\n\u2217\n7 we define VM\nand state the theorem, which says\n(1.4)\n\n\u2217\n\u03c6\u2217K (IH \u2217 (M//G)) = VM\n.\n\nThis is proved in section 8 and several examples are computed in section 9.\nThe proof of (1.4) is unfortunately quite lengthy and so I briefly sketch the\noutline. Our proof is by induction on the maximum among the dimensions of\nstabilizers. We first show that\n\u2217\n\u03c6\u2217K (IH \u2217 (M//G)) \u2282 VM\n.\n\nThis is best seen from the sheaf theoretic perspective and we need the full strength\nof the weakly balanced condition for the computation of stalks.\nNext let M\u0302 be the first blow-up in the partial desingularization process [Kir85].\nBy our induction hypothesis, we have\n\u2217\n\u03c6\u0302\u2217K (IH \u2217 (M\u0302 //G)) = VM\u0302\n\nwhere \u03c6\u0302 : M\u0302 ss \u2192 M\u0302 //G is the GIT quotient map. Then we show there is an\nembedding\n\u2217\n\u2217 \u223c\nVM\n\u0592\u2192 VM\u0302\n= IH \u2217 (M\u0302 //G).\n\n\f4\n\nYOUNG-HOON KIEM\n\nSince the difference between IH \u2217 (M\u0302 //G) and IH \u2217 (M//G) comes from a sheaf complex supported at the exceptional divisor, we will see that the proof reduces to the\ncomputation for the normal bundle N to the blow-up center in M ss . By spectral\nsequence, this further reduces to the computation for the normal space at a point.\nUpon checking this, we complete the proof.\nThe main application of the results of this paper is to generalize the theorem of\nJeffrey and Kirwan [JK98] about the intersection numbers on the smooth moduli\nspaces of bundles over a Riemann surface. In a joint work with Jeffrey, Kirwan and\nWoolf, we will show that the intersection numbers of the intersection cohomology\nof the singular moduli spaces of bundles over a Riemann surface are given by a\nresidue formula similar to that of [JK98].\n\u2217\nThe first version of this paper was written several years ago. There VM\nwas\nss\n\u2217\ndefined and it was shown that the Kirwan map \u03baM restricted to VM is an isomorphism onto IH \u2217 (M//G) under the weakly balanced condition (Definition 7.2).\nAbout a year later, in [KW], we generalized the Kirwan map to symplectic reductions and extended the results of this paper to the purely symplectic setting by\ninterpreting the first condition of the weakly balanced action as the cosupport axiom for intersection homology sheaf. After finishing [KW], it occurred to us that\nthe almost-balanced condition could be most naturally explained in terms of (p, q)placid maps and hence the current paper was revised using this new observation.\nIn [Kie], we showed that the extended moduli spaces defined by L. Jeffrey [Jef94]\nsatisfy our assumptions and hence we can compute the intersection cohomology of\nrepresentation spaces of surface groups in terms of the equivariant cohomology.\nEvery cohomology group in this paper has complex coefficients.\nAcknowledgements.

Intersection cohomology\nIntersection cohomology was introduced by Goresky and MacPherson in [GM80,\nGM83] as an invariant of singular spaces which retains useful properties like Poincar\u00e9\nduality and Lefschetz theorems.

A pseudo-manifold X of\ndimension n is normal if Hn (X, X \u2212 x) = 1 for any x \u2208 X.\n2.2. Deligne's construction of intersection cohomology sheaf. Let\np : {2, 3, * * * , n} \u2192 {0, 1, 2, * * * , n \u2212 2}\nbe an increasing function such that q(i) = i \u2212 2 \u2212 p(i) is also an increasing nonnegative function. We call such p a perversity. For instance,\nm(i) = [\n\ni\u22122\n]\n2\n\nis the middle perversity and t(i) = i \u2212 2 is the top perversity. Given a normal\nstratified pseudo-manifold X with stratification (X), put U2k = X \u2212 Xn\u22122k and\nlet j2k : U2k \u0592\u2192 U2k+2 denote the inclusion. Then the perversity p intersection\ncohomology IHp\u2217 (X) of X is the hypercohomology of the sheaf complex defined\ninductively by\nIC *p,X |U2 = CU2\nIC *p,X |U2k+2 \u223c\n= \u03c4\u2264p(2k) Rj2k \u2217 (IC *p,X |U2k ).\nThis defines an object in the derived category D+\nc (X) of bounded below cohomologically constructible sheaves, which is independent of the choice of stratification, and\nthe intersection cohomology is a homeomorphism invariant [GM83]. If p is the zero\nperversity, i.e. p(i) = 0, then IC *p,X \u223c\n= C and hence IH0\u2217 (X) is isomorphic to the\n\u2217\n(singular) cohomology H (X).

See \u00a74.\n\n\f6\n\nYOUNG-HOON KIEM\n\n2.3. Geometric chains. Explicitly intersection cohomology can by described in\nterms of geometric chains. Suppose X is a subanalytic pseudo-manifold with subanalytic stratification X = {Xi }. For an open subset U let C \u2217 (U ) be the chain\ncomplex defined by\nC i (U ) = {locally finite chains in U of dimension n \u2212 i}.\nNote that our indexing scheme is \"cohomology superscript\" ([GM83] p98).\nFor an open subset U and a perversity p, define a subcomplex of C \u2217 (U ) by\nICpi (U ) = {\u03be \u2208 C i (U ) |\n\ndim(|\u03be| \u2229 Xn\u2212c \u2229 U ) \u2264 n \u2212 i \u2212 c + p(c),\ndim(|\u2202\u03be| \u2229 Xn\u2212c \u2229 U ) \u2264 n \u2212 i \u2212 1 \u2212 c + p(c)}.\n\nThis gives rise to a soft sheaf complex which is isomorphic to IC *p,X . (See \u00a72.1,\n\u00a73.6 [GM83].) Hence the cohomology of ICp\u2217 (X) is the perversity p intersection\ncohomology IHp\u2217 (X).\n2.4. Intersection pairing. If perversities p, q, r satisfy p + q \u2264 r, then there is a\nunique morphism\nIC *p,X \u2297L IC *q,X \u2192 IC *r,X\nin D+\nc (X) extending C \u2297 C \u2192 C over U2 ([GM83] p112). This morphism induces\na homomorphism\nIHpi (X) \u2297 IHqj (X) \u2192 IHri+j (X).\nFor instance if p = q = r = 0 then this is just the cup product of cohomology\nclasses.\nFor the middle perversity m, we have m + m \u2264 t. Thus if X is normal compact\nconnected oriented pseudo-manifold, we have the intersection pairing\n(2.2)\n\ni\nj\nIHm\n(X) \u2297 IHm\n(X) \u2192 IHtn (X) \u223c\n=C\n\nfor i + j = n. In terms of geometric chains, this intersection pairing is defined as\n\u2217\n(X) such that deg(\u03b1) + deg(\u03b2) = n, we can find reprefollows: For \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 IHm\nsentative cycles \u03be and \u03c3 such that they intersect only at finitely many points in\nthe smooth part U2 , transversely. The intersection pairing h\u03b1, \u03b2i of \u03b1 and \u03b2 is the\nnumber of intersection points counted with signs as usual. (See \u00a72.3 [GM80].)\n2.5. Equivariant intersection cohomology. Suppose a compact connected Lie\ngroup K acts on a pseudo-manifold preserving a topological stratification X = {Xi }\n(\u00a72.2). Let EK be a contractible space on which K acts freely and BK = EK/K.\nThen the closed subsets\nEK \u00d7K Xi\nform a filtration of XK := EK \u00d7K X. For a perversity p, apply Deligne's construction (\u00a72.2) to this filtration to obtain a sheaf complex IC *p,XK . The equivariant\n\u2217\n(X) is defined as the hypercohomology of this sheaf\nintersection cohomology IHp,K\ncomplex. (See \u00a75.2, \u00a713.4 in [BL94].) From the fibration XK \u2192 BK with fiber X,\nwe get a spectral sequence\ni+j\nH i (BK) \u2297 IH j (X) \u21d2 IHp,K\n(X).\n\nMore concretely, choose a smooth classifying sequence (\u00a712 [BL94])\nEK0 \u2282 EK1 \u2282 EK2 \u2282 * * *\n\n\fINTERSECTION COHOMOLOGY OF QUOTIENTS OF NONSINGULAR VARIETIES\n\n7\n\nwhere EKk is a k-acyclic free K-manifold.

Placid maps\nUnlike ordinary cohomology, intersection cohomology is contravariant only for a\nlimited class of maps. In this section we generalize slightly the concept of placid\nmaps due to Goresky and MacPherson and show the functoriality. This will give\nus the right inverse of the Kirwan map.\n3.1. Placid maps. Let f : X \u2192 Y be a subanalytic map between subanalytic\npseudo-manifolds. Suppose Y is compact.\nDefinition 3.1. f is called (p, q)-placid if there is a subanalytic stratification of Y\nsuch that\n(3.1)\n\nq(codim S) \u2264 p(codim f \u22121 (S))\n\nfor each stratum S of Y .\nWhen p = q, we recover the original placid maps [GM85].\nWith this definition, Proposition 4.1 in [GM85] is modified as follows.\nProposition 3.2. If f is (p, q)-placid, then the pull-back of generic chains induces\na homomorphism on intersection cohomology\n(3.2)\n\nf \u2217 : IHq\u2217 (Y ) \u2192 IHp\u2217 (X).\n\nProof. See p373 in [GM85] for details. Since f is subanalytic, there is a stratification\nof X for which f is a stratified map ([GM83] \u00a71.2). By McCrory's transversality,\nany cohomology class \u03b1 in IHqi (Y ) can be represented by a chain \u03be which is dimensionally transverse to any stratum in X and the cycle f \u22121 (\u03be) lies in ICpi (X)\nbecause of (3.1). The class f \u2217 \u03b1 is represented by the cycle f \u22121 (\u03be).\n\u0003\n3.2. Pull-back morphism. The homomorphism (3.2) comes from a morphism\n(3.3)\n\nf \u2217 : IC *q,Y \u2192 Rf\u2217 IC *p,X\n\nin the derived category D+ (Y ).\nSuppose X = {Xi }ni=0 (resp. Y = {Yi }li=0 ) is a nice filtration of X (resp. Y ).\nLet f : X \u2192 Y be a continuous map such that for every connected component S of\nany stratum Yi \u2212 Yi\u22122 , f \u22121 (S) is a union of some connected components of strata\nin X and (3.1) holds.\n\n\f8\n\nYOUNG-HOON KIEM\n\nOver U2 = Y \u2212 Yl\u22122 , let fU\u22172 be the composition of the adjunction morphism\nCU2 \u2192 Rf\u2217 f \u2217 CU2 = Rf\u2217 Cf \u22121 (U2 ) with the morphism Rf\u2217 Cf \u22121 (U2 ) \u2192 Rf\u2217 IC *p,X |f \u22121 (U2 )\nfrom \u00a75.1 [GM83].\n\u2217\nProposition 3.3.

(See for instance [GeMa] p181.) It\nis elementary to find an injective resolution J * of \u03c4\u2264p A* such that I k = J k for\nk \u2264 p. Then Rf\u2217 A* = f\u2217 I * is equal to Rf\u2217 \u03c4\u2264p A* = f\u2217 J * up to degree p. So we\nproved the lemma.\n\u0003\nProof of Proposition 3.3.

Note that an intersection cycle \u03be is completely determined by its intersection with the open dense\nstratum ([B+ 84] p10) and over U2 (3.3) is just the adjunction. If we use the sheaf\ncomplexes by geometric chains (\u00a72.3) for IC *p,X and IC *q,Y , the induced homomorphism sends the class [\u03be] \u2208 IHq\u2217 (Y ), which is represented by a chain \u03be dimensionally\n\n\fINTERSECTION COHOMOLOGY OF QUOTIENTS OF NONSINGULAR VARIETIES\n\n9\n\ntransverse to any stratum of X, to [f \u22121 (\u03be)]. In other words, the induced homomorphism is exactly the homomorphism (3.2).\n3.3. Equivariant case. Suppose a compact connected Lie group K acts on X\npreserving a nice filtration X = {Xi }ni=0 . Deligne's construction with the filtration\n{EK \u00d7K Xi } and perversity p gives us IC *p,XK in D+ (XK ) whose hypercohomology\n\u2217\nis IHp,K\n(X).\nLet Y be a compact pseudo-manifold with a nice filtration Y = {Yi }m\ni=0 . Let\nf : X \u2192 Y be an invariant continuous map such that for any connected component\nS of a stratum, f \u22121 (S) is a union of some connected components of strata in X\nand (3.1) holds.\nThen the proof of Proposition 3.3 gives us a morphism\nIC *q,Y \u2192 RfK \u2217 IC *p,XK\n\n(3.4)\n\nwhere fK : XK = EK \u00d7K X \u2192 Y is the obvious map induced from f . So we have\na homomorphism\n\u2217\n\u2217\nfK\n: IHq\u2217 (Y ) \u2192 IHp,K\n(X).\n\n(3.5)\n\nSimilarly, we have a morphism\nIC *q,Y \u2192 Rfk \u2217 IC *p,EKk \u00d7K X\nwhere fk : EKk \u00d7K X \u2192 Y and a homomorphism\nfk\u2217 : IHq\u2217 (Y ) \u2192 IHp\u2217 (EKk \u00d7K X).\nFrom the commutative diagram\n\u0131k\n\n// EK \u00d7K X\nEKk \u00d7K PX\nPPP\nPPP\nPPP\nPPP \u000f\u000f\n''\nY\nwe see that the composition\nIHq\u2217 (Y )\n\n\u2217\nfK\n\n\u2217\n// IHp,K\n(X)\n\n\u0131\u2217\nk\n\n// IHp\u2217 (EKk \u00d7K X)\n\n\u2217\nis fk\u2217 since \u0131\u2217k IC *p,XK \u223c\n= IC *p,EKk \u00d7K X by construction. Hence {fk\u2217 } determine fK\nbecause of (2.3).\n\n3.4. f \u2217 preserves the intersection pairing. Our interest lies in the case where\nX is a smooth analytic manifold with an action by a compact connected Lie\ngroup K and f : X \u2192 Y is invariant. In particular we wish to relate the mid\u2217\ndle perversity intersection cohomology IHm\n(Y ) with the equivariant cohomology\n\u2217\n\u2217\nHK (X) = H (EK \u00d7K X). From now on when using middle perversity, we will\ndrop the subscript m for convenience.\nSuppose X is smooth. Then since intersection cohomology is independent of\nstratification, IHp\u2217 (X) \u223c\n= H \u2217 (X) for any perversity p and hence for any (p, m)-placid\nsubanalytic map f we have a homomorphism f \u2217 : IHq\u2217 (Y ) \u2192 H \u2217 (X). Obviously\n(t, m)-placid condition is most general for us to get such a homomorphism.\nIf furthermore K acts on X preserving a subanalytic stratification X for which\nf is (t, m)-placid stratified map with a stratification Y of Y , we have a morphism\n\u2217\nfK\n: IC *Y \u2192 RfK \u2217 CXK\n\n\f10\n\nYOUNG-HOON KIEM\n\nand the induced homomorphism\n\u2217\n\u2217\nfK\n: IH \u2217 (Y ) \u2192 HK\n(X).\n\nProposition 3.5. Let f : X \u2192 Y be a (t, m)-placid map. Suppose X is smooth and\nY is compact connected normal oriented. Let \u03c4 be the top degree class represented\nby a point in the smooth part. Then the induced map f \u2217 : IH \u2217 (Y ) \u2192 H \u2217 (X)\npreserves the intersection pairing in the sense that\n(3.6)\n\nf \u2217 (\u03b1) \u222a f \u2217 (\u03b2) = h\u03b1, \u03b2if \u2217 (\u03c4 )\n\nfor any \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 IH \u2217 (Y ) of complementary degrees. In the equivariant case, the same\n\u2217\n\u2217\nis true for fK\n: IH \u2217 (Y ) \u2192 HK\n(X).\nProof. Recall from \u00a72.4 that \u03b1 and \u03b2 are represented by intersection cycles \u03be and\n\u03c3 that intersect only at finitely many points in the smooth part. In this case,\n\u03be \u2229 \u03c3 \u2208 IC n (Y ) represents h\u03b1, \u03b2i\u03c4 \u2208 IH n (Y ). By McCrory's transversality result\nwe can further assume that \u03be and \u03c3 are dimensionally transverse to each stratum\nin X so that f \u2217 \u03b1 and f \u2217 \u03b2 are represented by f \u22121 (\u03be) and f \u22121 (\u03c3). Because X is\nsmooth, the complex C * of geometric chains is isomorphic to the constant sheaf\nCX and the cup product is just the intersection of chains. Hence the cup product\nf \u2217 (\u03b1) \u222a f \u2217 (\u03b2) is represented by f \u22121 (\u03be) \u2229 f \u22121 (\u03c3) = f \u22121 (\u03be \u2229 \u03c3) which also represents\nh\u03b1, \u03b2if \u2217 (\u03c4 ). So we proved (3.6).\nFor the equivariant case, observe that the statement is true for fk : EKk \u00d7K X \u2192\nY for any k since EKk \u00d7K X is a finite dimensional manifold. If we take a sufficiently\n\u2264l\n\u2217\nlarge k, then HK\n(X) \u223c\nwhere l = dim Y . So we\n= H \u2264l (EKk \u00d7K X) and fk\u2217 = fK\nare done.\n\u0003\nCorollary 3.6. Suppose furthermore f \u2217 (\u03c4 ) 6= 0 in H \u2217 (X). Then f \u2217 : IH \u2217 (Y ) \u2192\nH \u2217 (X) is injective and the intersection pairing is given by the cup product structure\nof H \u2217 (X). A similar result is true for the equivariant case.\nProof. The result follows from Proposition 3.5 since the intersection pairing is nondegenerate for IH \u2217 (Y ).\n\u0003\n4. Symplectic reduction\nLet (M, \u03c9) be a connected Hamiltonian K-space with proper moment map\n\u03bc : M \u2192 k\u2217 where k = Lie(K). Then the symplectic reduction X = \u03bc\u22121 (0)/K,\nwhich we denote by M//K, is in general a pseudomanifold, whose strata are symplectic manifolds. In this section, we describe the orbit type stratification and the\ninfinitesimal orbit type decomposition of X from [SL91, MS99].\n4.1. Stratification of X. Let Z = \u03bc\u22121 (0) and Z(H) = {x \u2208 Z | Stab(x) \u2208 (H)}\nfor a subgroup H of K, where (H) denotes the conjugacy class of H. Also, let\nZH = {x \u2208 Z | Stab(x) = H}. Then\nG\nZ(H)\n(4.1)\nZ=\n(H)\n\nand Z(H) = K \u00d7N H ZH where N\ninduces a stratification\n(4.2)\n\nH\n\nis the normalizer of H in K.

We\nrecall the following result from [SL91] Lemma 7.1.\nLemma 4.1. There exists a neighborhood of the submanifold Z(H) of M that is\nsymplectically and K-equivariantly diffeomorphic to a neighborhood of the zero section of a vector bundle N \u2192 Z(H) . The space N is a symplectic fiber bundle over\nthe stratum X(H)\nF \u2192 N \u2192 X(H)\nwith fiber F given by\nF = K \u00d7H ((k/h)\u2217 \u00d7 W ).\nIn particular, for any x \u2208 ZH , there is a neighborhood of the orbit Kx that is\nequivariantly diffeomorphic to F \u00d7 Rdim X(H) .\nNow the reduction of N is homeomorphic to a neighborhood of X(H) in X. The\nprinciple of reduction in stages gives us the following.\nProposition 4.2. ([SL91] 7.4) Given a stratum X(H) of X, there exists a fiber\nbundle over X(H) with typical fiber being the cone W//H such that a neighborhood\nof the vertex section of this bundle is symplectically diffeomorphic to a neighborhood\nof the stratum inside X.\nConsequently, {X(H) } gives us a topological stratification of X. This is called\nthe orbit type stratification.\n4.2. Stratification of M ss . Let M ss denote the open subset of elements in M\nwhose gradient flow for f = \u2212|\u03bc|2 has a limit point in Z and put r : M ss \u2192 Z\ndenote the retraction by the flow.\nLet \u03c6 be the composition\n(4.4)\n\nM ss \u2192 Z \u2192 Z/K = X\n\nof the retraction r and the quotient map. Let us call it the symplectic quotient\nmap. The inverse image \u03c6\u22121 (X(H) ) of the stratum X(H) is diffeomorphic to a subfiber bundle of N in Lemma 4.1 with typical fiber K \u00d7H ((k/h)\u2217 \u00d7 \u03c6\u22121\nW (\u2217)) where\n\u03c6W : W \u2192 W//H is the symplectic quotient map for W and \u2217 = \u03c6W (0) is the vertex\nof the cone W//H. If we assign a complex structure, compatible with the symplectic\nss\nstructure, it is well-known that \u03c6\u22121\nwhere\nW (\u2217) is the affine cone over PW \u2212 PW\nthe superscript ss denotes the semistable set defined by Mumford [MFK94]. Hence,\nthe affine cones over the unstable strata of PW minus 0, together with {0}, give\nus a stratification of \u03c6\u22121 (X(H) ) via the diffeomorphism in Lemma 4.1. Observe\nthat M ss is diffeomorphic to a neighborhood of Z by the gradient flow of \u2212|\u03bc|2 .\nSince the diffeomorphism in Lemma 4.1 is K-equivariant and the stratification of\n\u03c6\u22121 (X(H) ) is completely determined by the group action, we get a K-invariant\nstratification of M ss for which \u03c6 : M ss \u2192 X is stratified.\nSee [Kir94] for a description of the above stratification for GIT quotients and an\napplication to the Atiyah-Jones conjecture.\n\n\f12\n\nYOUNG-HOON KIEM\n\n4.3. Infinitesimal orbit type decomposition. There is another way to decompose X which is useful for partial desingularization. For a Lie subalgebra h of k, let\nZh = {x \u2208 Z | LieStab(x) = h} and\nZ(h) = {x \u2208 Z | LieStab(x) \u2208 (h)}\nwhere (h) is the conjugacy class of h. Let X(h) = Z(h) /K. Then we have a decomposition\nG\nX(h) .\nX=\n(h)\n\nThis is called the infinitesimal orbit type decomposition of X. From [MS99] \u00a73,\nX(h) are just orbifolds and thus homology manifolds. If we use the local normal\nform in [MS99] \u00a73.1, it is elementary to show that Deligne's construction for this\ndecomposition gives us a topologically constructible sheaf complex with respect to\nthe orbit type stratification. This fact will not be used in this paper so we leave\nthe details to the reader.\n5. Almost-balanced action\nWe use the notations of the previous section. We assume that there is at least\none point in Z = \u03bc\u22121 (0) with finite stabilizer.\n5.1. Placid maps for symplectic quotients. With the orbit type stratification,\n\u03c6\u22121 (X(H) ) is a fiber bundle over X(H) with fiber K \u00d7H ((k/h)\u2217 \u00d7 \u03c6\u22121\nW (\u2217)) and hence\ncodim M ss \u03c6\u22121 (X(H) ) = codim W \u03c6\u22121\nW (\u2217).\nOn the other hand,\ncodim X X(H) = dim W//H\nby Proposition 4.2. Recall that the map \u03c6 : M ss \u2192 X is (t, m)-placid if\nt(codim M ss \u03c6\u22121 (X(H) )) \u2265 m(codim X X(H) )\nor equivalently\ncodim W \u03c6\u22121\nW (\u2217) \u2212 2 \u2265\n\n1\ndim W//H \u2212 1.\n2\n\nHence \u03c6 is (t, m)-placid if and only if\n(5.1)\n\ncodim W \u03c6\u22121\nW (\u2217) >\n\n1\ndim W//H\n2\n\nfor each (H).\nThe unstable strata of PW by the norm square of the moment map can be described using the weights of the maximal torus action, as follows: For any collection\nof weights of the maximal torus action, we consider the convex hull of them and\nget the closest point from the origin to the hull. Let B be the set of such closest\npoints in the positive Weyl chamber. Then the unstable strata are in one-to-one\ncorrespondence with the set B. (See [Kir84].)\nFor each \u03b2 \u2208 B, let n(\u03b2) denote the number of weights \u03b1 such that h\u03b1, \u03b2i < h\u03b2, \u03b2i.\nThen Kirwan proved in [Kir84] that the codimension of the stratum corresponding\nto \u03b2 \u2208 B is precisely\n2n(\u03b2) \u2212 dim H/Stab\u03b2\n\n\fINTERSECTION COHOMOLOGY OF QUOTIENTS OF NONSINGULAR VARIETIES\n\n13\n\nwhere Stab\u03b2 is the stabilizer of \u03b2 in H. Therefore, the (t, m)-placid condition is\nequivalent to\n1\n(dim W \u2212 2 dim H)\n2\nfor each \u03b2 \u2208 B. In particular, this condition is satisfied when\n(5.2)\n\n2n(\u03b2) \u2212 dim H/Stab\u03b2 >\n\n1\ndim W\n2\nfor all \u03b2. For example, if the set of weights is symmetric with respect to the origin,\nthe above is satisfied . This is the case for the moduli spaces of vector bundles over\na Riemann surface. (See Proposition 7.4.)\nWhen K = U (1) acts on M = Pn linearly and if n+ , n0 , n\u2212 denote the number\nof positive, zero, negative weights respectively, then the condition (5.2) is satisfied\nif and only if n+ = n\u2212 . Hence the (t, m)-placid condition may be viewed as a\ncondition on \"balancedness of weights\".\n2n(\u03b2) \u2265\n\nDefinition 5.1. [KW] The action on M is said to be almost balanced if the condition (5.2) is satisfied for all \u03b2 and (H).\nRemark 5.2. By (5.1), if almost balanced, we have an isomorphism\n\u0001\n<aH\n<aH\nHH\n(W ) \u223c\nW \u2212 \u03c6\u22121\n= HH\nW (\u2217)\n\nwhere aH = 12 dim W//H = 12 dim W \u2212 dim H. This is an easy consequence of the\nGysin sequence (applied stratum by stratum) because \u03c6\u22121\nW (\u2217) is stratified.\n\n5.2. Almost-balanced action and GIT quotient. We recall the following wellknown facts from [Kir84]: The obvious action of U (n + 1) on Pn is Hamiltonian\nwith moment map \u03bcPn . When M \u2282 Pn is a smooth projective variety and K acts\non M via a homomorphism K \u2192 U (n + 1), the composition\n\u03bc : M\u001f\n\n\u007f\n\n// Pn\n\n\u03bcPn\n\n// u(n + 1)\u2217\n\n// k\u2217\n\nis the moment map for M and the set of semistable points in M is equal to the\nminimal Morse stratum M ss for \u2212|\u03bc|2 . The GIT quotient M//G of M is homeomorphic to the symplectic reduction M//K and the symplectic quotient map\n\u03c6 : M ss \u2192 M//K is the GIT quotient map. Since we are interested in topology, we\nwill not distinguish symplectic quotients from GIT quotients.\nTheorem 5.3. Let M \u2282 Pn be a smooth projective variety acted on by a compact\nconnected Lie group K via a homomorphism K \u2192 U (n + 1). Suppose the K action\nis almost balanced and there is at least one point in Z with finite stabilizer. Then\nwe have a natural map\n(5.3)\n\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u03c6\u2217K : IH \u2217 (X) \u2192 HK\n(M ss ) \u223c\n(Z)\n= HK\n\nof the middle perversity intersection cohomology of X = \u03bc\u22121 (0)/K into the Kequivariant cohomology of M ss . Moreover, \u03c6\u2217K is injective and the intersection\n\u2217\npairing of IH \u2217 (X) is given by the cup product of HK\n(Z) from the formula\n\u03c6\u2217K (\u03b1) \u222a \u03c6\u2217K (\u03b2) = h\u03b1, \u03b2i\u03c6\u2217K (\u03c4 )\nwhere \u03c4 is the class in IH dim X (X) represented by a point.\n\n\f14\n\nYOUNG-HOON KIEM\n\nProof. Certainly the GIT quotient map is subanalytic and the stratification of M ss\nin \u00a74.2 is K-invariant. The almost balanced condition is equivalent to the (t, m)placid condition and hence we have\n\u2217\n\u2217\n\u03c6\u2217K : IH \u2217 (X) \u2192 HK\n(M ss ) \u223c\n(Z)\n= HK\n\nby Proposition 3.5. For injectivity and intersection pairing, it suffices to show that\n\u2217\n\u03c6\u2217K (\u03c4 ) is nonzero in HK\n(Z) by Corollary 3.6.\nLet \u03a3 denote the set of points in Z whose stabilizer is not finite. According to\n[MS99] \u00a74, there is an equivariant proper map \u03c0 : Z\u0303 \u2192 Z such that \u03c0|\u03c0\u22121 (Z\u2212\u03a3) is\na homeomorphism and the stabilizer of every point in Z\u0303 is a finite group. Thus\n\u2217\nHK\n(Z\u0303) \u223c\n= H \u2217 (Z\u0303/K).\nLet X s = (Z \u2212 \u03a3)/K and consider the commutative diagram of natural maps\n\u03c6\u2217\n\ndim X\nHcdim X (X s ) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 HK\n(Z)\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\u223c\uf8e6\n=\ny\ny\n\u223c\n=\n\ndim X\nH dim X (Z\u0303/K) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 HK\n(Z\u0303)\n\nwhere the subscript c denotes compact support. The class \u03c4 is the image of a\nnonzero class in Hcdim X (X s ) and hence it follows from the above diagram that\n\u03c6\u2217K (\u03c4 ) is nonzero.\n\u0003\nRemark 5.4. Recall that (5.3) comes from a morphism (3.4) in the derived category D+\nc (X) of bounded below cohomologically constructible sheaves over X because \u03c6 : M ss \u2192 X is (t, m)-placid. In particular, for any open subset U \u2282 X\n\u2217\nwe get a map \u03c6\u2217K : IH \u2217 (U ) \u2192 HK\n(\u03c6\u22121 (U )) and it is functorial with respect to\nrestrictions.\n6. The Kirwan map\nIn this section, we recall the definition of the Kirwan map from [Kir86b] and\nshow that it is a left inverse of the pull-back homomorphism \u03c6\u2217K .\nLet M \u2282 Pn be a connected nonsingular projective variety acted on linearly by\na connected reductive group G via a homomorphism G \u2192 GL(n + 1). We may\nassume that the maximal compact subgroup K of G = K C acts unitarily possibly\nafter conjugation. Let \u03bc : Pn \u2192 u(n + 1)\u2217 \u2192 k\u2217 be the moment map for the action\nof K. Then M ss = M \u2229 (Pn )ss retracts onto Z := \u03bc\u22121 (0) \u2229 M by the gradient flow\nof \u2212|\u03bc|2 and the GIT quotient M//G is homeomorphic to the symplectic quotient\nM//K = M \u2229 \u03bc\u22121 (0)/K =: X.\n6.1. Definition of the Kirwan map. In order to define the Kirwan map, we\nassume that there is at least one stable point in M , which amounts to saying that\nthere is at least one point in Z whose stabilizer is finite.\nWe quote the following definitions from [Kir85].\nDefinition 6.1.\n(1) Let R(M ) be a set of representatives of the conjugacy\nclasses of identity components of all subgroups of K which appear as the\nstabilizer of some point x \u2208 Z = \u03bc\u22121 (0).\nss\ndenote the set of those x \u2208 M ss fixed by H \u2208 R(M ).\n(2) Let MH\n(3) Let r(M ) = max{dim H| H \u2208 R(M )}.\n\n\fINTERSECTION COHOMOLOGY OF QUOTIENTS OF NONSINGULAR VARIETIES\n\n15\n\nss\nOf course, MH\nis a smooth complex manifold.\nThe definition of the Kirwan map is by induction on r(M ). When r(M ) = 0,\nthe action of K is locally free and X is an orbifold. Thus IC *X \u223c\n= CX . The pullback morphism \u03c6\u2217K in this case is equal to the adjunction morphism CX \u2192 R\u03c6K \u2217 C\nwhich is an isomorphism by [BL94] Theorem 9.1 (ii).

If we keep blowing up in this fashion, we get a quasi-projective variety M\ne\nbirational to M whose quotient X has only finite quotient singularities. This is\ncalled the partial desingularization of X.

Weakly-balanced action. Let us make precise our assumption. We use the\nnotations of \u00a76.1.\nDefinition 7.1. Let M \u2282 Pn be a projective variety with an action of a compact\nLie group K via a homomorphism K \u2192 U (n + 1). We say the K action on M is\nweakly balanced if it is almost balanced and so is the N H /H action on the H-fixed\nsubmanifold MH for each H \u2208 R(M ), where N H is the normalizer of H in K.\nFor practical application, the following 2-step equivalent definition is more useful.\nRecall that G is the complexification of K which acts on M via a homomorphism\nG \u2192 GL(n + 1).\nDefinition 7.2.\n(1) Suppose a nontrivial compact group H acts on a vector\nspace W unitarily. Using the notations of \u00a75, the action is said to be weakly\nlinearly balanced if\n1\n(7.1)\n2n(\u03b2) \u2212 dim H/Stab\u03b2 > (dim W \u2212 2 dim H)\n2\nfor every \u03b2 \u2208 B.\n(2) The K-action on M is said to be weakly balanced if for each H \u2208 R(M )\nand for a point x \u2208 \u03bc\u22121 (0) with Lie Stab(x) = LieH, the linear action\nss\nof H on the normal space Nx to GMH\nis weakly linearly balanced and so\nis the action of (H \u2229 N L )/L on the L-fixed linear subspace Nx,L for each\nconnected subgroup L of H whose conjugate appears in R(M ).\nLemma 7.3. The two definitions 7.1 and 7.2 are equivalent.\nProof. Let x \u2208 \u03bc\u22121 (0) and P = Stab(x). Let L be the identity component of P .\nBy Lemma 4.1, a neighborhood of Kx is equivariantly diffeomorphic to\nK \u00d7P ((k/p)\u2217 \u00d7 W ) \u00d7 Rdim X(P )\nfor some symplectic P -vector space W . Let us call W the normal slice at x.\nSince P/L is discrete, P \u2282 N L and P acts on the L-fixed subspace W L of W .\nBy direct computation, one can check that MLss in this neighborhood is\n\u0001\nN L \u00d7P (nL /p)\u2217 \u00d7 W L \u00d7 Rdim X(P )\n\nand hence GMLss is\n\n\u0001\nK \u00d7P (k/p)\u2217 \u00d7 W L \u00d7 Rdim X(P )\n\nwhere nL (resp. p) is the Lie algebra of N L (resp. P ). Therefore the normal space\nNx to GMLss is the orthogonal complement of W L in W .\nIf x is a generic point in MLss \u2229 \u03bc\u22121 (0) such that P is minimal among those\ncontaining L, then Nx = W . Suppose the K-action on M is almost balanced, i.e.\nthe action of Stab(x) on the normal slice W at x is weakly linearly balanced for all\nx \u2208 \u03bc\u22121 (0). Then by choosing a generic x for each L \u2208 R(M ), we deduce that the\naction of L on the normal space Nx = W to GMLss is weakly linearly balanced.\nIn general, we only have Nx \u2282 W . But L acts trivially on Nx\u22a5 \u2229 W and hence\nthe weights of the maximal torus action on Nx\u22a5 \u2229 W are all zero. By examining\nthe inequality (7.1) it is easy to see that if the L-action on Nx is weakly linearly\nbalanced then so is the P action on W . Therefore, if for each L \u2208 R(M ) the\naction of L on the normal space to GMLss at a generic point x \u2208 \u03bc\u22121 (0) with\nLieStab(x) = Lie(L) is weakly linearly balanced, then the action of Stab(x) on the\n\n\f18\n\nYOUNG-HOON KIEM\n\nnormal slice W at x is weakly linearly balanced for all x \u2208 \u03bc\u22121 (0), i.e. the K-action\non M is almost balanced.\nNow let J \u2208 R(M ) and suppose x \u2208 MJss \u2229 \u03bc\u22121 (0). Then L \u2283 J. Using\nLemma 8.2 which is purely a group theoretic result, it is direct to check that in the\nneighborhood of Kx, MJss is\n\u0001\nN J \u00d7P \u2229N J (nJ /p \u2229 nJ )\u2217 \u00d7 W J \u00d7 \u0001Rdim X(P )\n\u223c\n= N J /J \u00d7P \u2229N J /J (nJ /p \u2229 nJ )\u2217 \u00d7 W J \u00d7 Rdim X(P )\nSee the proof of Proposition 8.4 for a similar computation.\nIf Stab(x) is minimal with LieStab(x) = LieL so that Nx = W , then the J-fixed\nsets Nx,J and W J are isomorphic. In general, we only have Nx,J \u2282 W J . But by the\narguments in the previous paragraphs, we deduce that the action of N J /J on MJ\nis almost balanced if and only if the action of L \u2229 N J /J on Nx,J is weakly linearly\nbalanced for x \u2208 \u03bc\u22121 (0) with LieStab(x) = LieL for all L \u2283 J. So we proved the\nlemma.\n\u0003\nThe weakly balanced condition is satisfied by many interesting spaces including\nthe diagonal SL(2) action on (P1 )2n . (See \u00a79.) Also, it is satisfied by (the GIT\nconstruction of) the moduli spaces of holomorphic vector bundles over a Riemann\nsurface of any rank and any degree. For the next proposition, let us use Definition\n7.2.\nProposition 7.4. Let M (n, d) be the moduli space of rank n holomorphic vector\nbundles of degree d > n(2g \u2212 1) over a Riemann surface \u03a3 of genus g, which is\na GIT quotient of a nonsingular quasiprojective variety R(n, d)ss by G = SL(p)\nfor p = d \u2212 n(g \u2212 1). (See [New78, Kir86a].) The action of SL(p) on R(n, d)ss is\nweakly balanced.\nProof. Let E be a semistable vector bundle such that E \u223c\n= m1 E1 \u2295* * *\u2295ms Es where\nEi 's are non-isomorphic stable bundlesQwith the same slope. Then the identity\ns\ncomponent of Stab E in G is H C = S( i=1 GL(mi )) where S denotes the subset\nss\nof elements whose determinant is 1. The normal space to GMH\nat E is ([AB82,\nKir86a])\nH 1 (\u03a3, End\u2032\u2295 E) = H 1 (\u03a3, \u2295i,j (mi mj \u2212 \u03b4ij )Hom(Ei , Ej ))\n= \u2295i,j H 1 (\u03a3, (mi mj \u2212 \u03b4ij )Ei\u2217 \u2297 Ej )\nMore precisely,\nH 1 (\u03a3, End\u2032\u2295 E) = \u2295i<j [H 1 (\u03a3, Ei\u2217 \u2297 Ej ) \u2297 Hom(Cmi , Cmj )\n\u2295H 1 (\u03a3, Ei \u2297 Ej\u2217 ) \u2297 Hom(Cmj , Cmi )]\n\u2295[\u2295i H 1 (\u03a3, End Ei ) \u2297 sl(mi )]\nBecause Ei is not isomorphic to Ej for i 6= j, H 0 (\u03a3, Ei\u2217 \u2297 Ej ) = 0 = H 0 (\u03a3, Ei \u2297 Ej\u2217 )\nand thus\ndim H 1 (\u03a3, Ei\u2217 \u2297 Ej )\n\n= \u2212RR(\u03a3, Ei\u2217 \u2297 Ej ) = (rank Ei )(rank Ej )(g \u2212 1)\n= \u2212RR(\u03a3, Ei \u2297 Ej\u2217 ) = dim H 1 (\u03a3, Ei \u2297 Ej\u2217 )\n\nwhere RR denotes the Riemann-Roch number. Therefore, the weights of the representation of H C on H 1 (\u03a3, End\u2032\u2295 E) are symmetric with respect to the origin. This\nimplies that the action is weakly linearly\nbalanced. As each subgroup LC as in\nQs\nDefinition 7.2 (2) is conjugate to S( i=1 GL(m\u2032i )) for a \"subdivision\" (m\u20321 , m\u20322 , ...)\n\n\fINTERSECTION COHOMOLOGY OF QUOTIENTS OF NONSINGULAR VARIETIES\n\n19\n\nof (m1 , m2 , ...), it is easy to check that such H \u2229 N L /L action on the L-fixed point\nset is also weakly linearly balanced.\n\u0003\n7.2.

Let M \u2282 Pn be a projective smooth variety acted on unitarily by a\ncompact connected group K with at least one stable point. Suppose that the weakly\n\u2217\nbalanced condition is satisfied.

Proof of Theorem 7.7\nThis section is devoted to a proof of Theorem 7.7. Let us use the notations of\n\u00a76.1 and \u00a77. Recall that\n(8.1)\n\nr := r(M ) = max{dim H | H \u2208 R(M )}.\n\nOur proof is by induction on r(M ).\nWhen r = 0, we have nothing to prove since\n\u223c IH \u2217 (M//G).\nV \u2217 = H \u2217 (M ss ) =\nM\n\nK\n\nSo we consider the case r > 0. Suppose the theorem is true for all projective\nvarieties \u0393 with r(\u0393) \u2264 r \u2212 1. Let M\u0302 be the blowup of M ss along the submanifold\nG\nss\n.\nGMH\ndim H=r\n\nThen from [Kir85] \u00a76, we have\nR(M\u0302 ) = {H \u2208 R(M ) | dim H \u2264 r \u2212 1}\nand thus r(M\u0302 ) \u2264 r \u2212 1.\nFor simplicity, we assume from now on that there exists only one H such that\ndim H = r. (The general case is no more difficult except for repetition. We can\ndeal with each H one by one. See [Kir85], Cor.8.3.) We fix this H once and for all\ntill the end of this section.\nRemark 8.1. (1) To be precise, we have to take the closure of M\u0302 with respect to a\nsuitable linearization described in [Kir85] and then resolve the possible singularities.\nBut as argued in [Kir85], this does not cause any trouble for us because all the\nsemistable points are contained in M\u0302 and we are only interested in the semistable\npoints.\n(2) By [Kir86b] 1.6, for L \u2208 R(M\u0302 ), the L-fixed set M\u0302Lss in M\u0302 ss is the proper\ntransform of the L-fixed set MLss in M ss . In particular, the normal space to GM\u0302Lss\nin M\u0302 ss at a generic point is isomorphic to the normal space to GMLss in M ss at a\ngeneric point. Notice that the weakly balanced condition in Definition 7.2 is purely\nabout the actions of L on the normal spaces Nx to GMLss for L \u2208 R(M ). (The\nfixed set by a subgroup of L is determined by the action of L.) Therefore, if the\nK-action on M ss is weakly balanced, the action on M\u0302 is also weakly balanced.\n\u2217\nBy our induction hypothesis, \u03c6\u0302\u2217K (IH \u2217 (M\u0302 //G)) = VM\u0302\nand the same holds for any\n\nopen subset of X\u0302 = M\u0302 //G.\nWe start the proof with a few lemmas.\nLemma 8.2. ([Kir85] Proposition 8.10) Suppose L \u2282 P are compact subgroups of\nK and L is connected. Then there exist finitely many elements k1 , k2 , * * * , km in K\nsuch that\nG\n{k \u2208 K | k \u22121 Lk \u2282 P } =\nN L ki P\n1\u2264i\u2264m\n\nwhere N L is the normalizer of L in K.\nProof.

Since \u03c0K\nis an\ninjection by the well-known argument in [GH94] p605, we may think of \u03b6 as an\n\u2217\nelement of HK\n(M\u0302 ). By Lemma 8.3, if \u03b6|GMHss = 0 i.e. \u03b6|E = 0, then \u03b6|M\u0302 ss 6= 0.\nLet us now consider the case when \u03b6|GMHss 6= 0.

Because the\nK-action is almost balanced, the codimensions of the unstable strata in PNx are\ngreater than nH by (5.2). Therefore, by the equivariant Morse theory [Kir84], we\ndeduce that the restriction homomorphism\n<nH\n<nH\nHH\n(PNx ) \u2192 HH\n(PNxss )\n<nH\n<nH\nis an isomorphism. In particular, HH\ninjects into HH\n(PNxss ). By (8.15) and\n\u2217\n\u2217\n(8.14), the image of \u03b6 in HK\n(E ss ) is not zero and thus \u03b6 injects into HK\n(M\u0302 ss ).\nIt is obvious from our proof that the statement is true for any open set U in\nX.\n\u0003\nss\nLet N be the normal bundle to GMH\nin M ss and NU be the normal bundle\nss\n\u22121\nto GMH \u2229 \u03c6 (U ) for any open subset U of X.

We identify NU with a\nss\ntubular neighborhood of GMH\n\u2229 \u03c6\u22121 (U ) and identify NU //K with a neighborhood\nU1 of U \u2229 X(h) in U .\nBy the gradient flow of \u2212|\u03bc|2 , M ss can be equivariantly retracted into \u03bc\u22121 (D\u03b5 )\nwhere D\u03b5 is the disk of radius \u03b5 around 0 in k\u2217 . By shrinking U1 if necessary and taking \u03b5 sufficiently small, \u03c6\u22121 (U1 ) is retracted into NU . Conversely, if we decrease the\nss\nradius of a tubular neighborhood of GMH\n\u2229\u03c6\u22121 (U ), it is included in \u03c6\u22121 (U1 ). These\ntwo inclusions are clearly inverse to each other homotopically and K-equivariantly\nsince \u03bc is equivariant.

For an open subset U of X, let B \u2217 (U ) be the kernel of the\nKirwan map restricted to V\u03c6\u2217\u22121 (U) . Then by Proposition 8.4, we can write\nV\u03c6\u2217\u22121 (U) = IH \u2217 (U ) \u2295 B \u2217 (U ).\n\n(8.16)\n\nWe have to show that B \u2217 (U ) is zero.\nLet \u00db be the preimage of U by the blow-up map \u03c3 : X\u0302 \u2192 X. By our induction\nhypothesis, the pull-back \u03c6\u0302\u2217K is an isomorphism of IH \u2217 (\u00db ) onto V\u03c6\u0302\u2217\u22121 (\u00db) and the\nKirwan map is its inverse.\nRecall that we have the decomposition (6.5) which induces an isomorphism\nIH \u2217 (\u00db ) \u223c\n= IH \u2217 (U ) \u2295 F \u2217 (U )\n\n(8.17)\n\nwhere F \u2217 (U ) is the hypercohomology of F * over U . Since B \u2217 (U ) is mapped to zero\nby\nV\u03c6\u2217\u22121 (U) \u0592\u2192 V\u03c6\u0302\u2217\u22121 (\u00db ) \u223c\n= IH \u2217 (\u00db ) \u223c\n= IH \u2217 (U ) \u2295 F \u2217 (U ) \u2192 IH \u2217 (U )\nwe see that B \u2217 (U ) injects into F \u2217 (U ).\nAs \u03c6\u2217K , \u03bass\nM and (8.17) all came from sheaf complexes, we have the following\ncommutative diagram by restriction\n\u223c\n\u223c\n\u007f\n=\n=\n// IH \u2217 (\u00db )\n// IH \u2217 (U ) \u2295 F \u2217 (U )\n// IH \u2217 (U )\n// V\u03c6\u0302\u2217\u22121 (\u00db)\nV\u03c6\u2217\u22121 (U) \u001f\n\u000f\u000f \u007f\nVN\u2217U \u001f\n\n\u000f\u000f\n// V \u2217\nN\u0302\n\nU\n\n\u000f\u000f\n// IH \u2217 (N\u0302U //K)\n\n\u223c\n=\n\n\u000f\u000f\n// IH \u2217 (NU //K) \u2295 F \u2217 (U )\n\n\u000f\u000f\n// IH \u2217 (NU //G)\n\nwhere N\u0302U is the preimage of NU in M\u0302 ss . Since F * is supported over X(h) =\nss\nGMH\n//G, the vertical map for F \u2217 (U ) is the identity map.\nNow let \u03b6 be a nonzero element in B \u2217 (U ). We know \u03b6 is mapped to a nonzero\nelement, say \u03b7 in F \u2217 (U ). In the above diagram, \u03b7 is mapped to zero in IH \u2217 (NU //G).\nThen by Proposition 8.6, \u03b6|NU = 0 and thus \u03b7 = 0. This is a contradiction!

Consider the\naction of H on Y and \u0176 where H acts trivially on the summand C.\nLemma 8.8. The actions of H on Y and \u0176 are weakly balanced.\nProof. We identify the hyperplane at infinity Y \u2212 Nx with PNx . The equation for\nthe hyperplane at infinity is H-invariant and hence Y ss contains Nx . Therefore\nY ss = Nx \u222a PNxss . Let 0 6= y \u2208 Nx and suppose be the corresponding point y in\nPNx is semistable. By [Kir85] Lemma 4.3, y is fixed by L if and only if y is fixed\nby L. Hence we may consider only points in Nx .\nLet Stab(x) = P . Since we could use any x \u2208 \u03bc\u22121 (0) as long as the infinitesimal\nstabilizer is Lie H, we assume that P is minimal among the stabilizers whose Lie\nalgebra is Lie H so that Nx = W in the notation of Lemma 4.1.\nFirst since the action of K on M is weakly balanced, the action of H on Nx is\nweakly linearly balanced and so is the action of H \u2229 N L /L on the L-fixed subspace\nNx,L . Hence we checked the weakly balanced condition for H.\n\u22121\nNow let 0 6= y \u2208 \u03bcN\n(0) and let L be the identity component of the stabilizer of\nx\ny. Then from (8.8), we see that the normal space to GMLss in M ss is the same as the\nnormal space to PC W L in W at a generic point. But H is the identity component\nof P and Nx = W . Hence the normal space to GMLss in M ss at a generic point is\nisomorphic to the normal space to HC Nx,L in Nx at a generic point. Moreover since\nthe diffeomorphism in Lemma 4.1 is equivariant, the actions of L on the normal\nspaces are identical. According to Definition 7.2, the weakly balanced condition is\npurely about the action of L on the normal spaces to HC Nx,L for all L. Because\nthe action of K on M is weakly balanced, we deduce that the action of H on Nx is\nweakly balanced. So we proved that the action of H on Y is weakly balanced.\nNote that \u0176 is the first blow-up in the partial desingularization for Y and hence\nr(\u0176 ) < r = r(M ) by [Kir85] 6.1. By Remark 8.1 (2), the action on \u0176 is also weakly\nbalanced.\n\u0003\nIf we let Nx = Spec A for some polynomial ring A, then by definition [MFK94]\nthere are homeomorphisms\nPNx //H \u223c\nNx //H \u223c\n= Proj AH\n= Spec AH\ni.e. Nx //H is the affine cone of PNx //H and Y //H is the projective cone of PNx //H.\n\n\f28\n\nYOUNG-HOON KIEM\n\nSince the equation for the hyperplane at infinity in Y is invariant, by construction\nof Y //G ([MFK94] Chapter 1 \u00a74), it is obvious that the preimage of Nx //H by the\nGIT quotient map \u03c6Y : Y ss \u2192 Y //H is Nx .

So we may\nuse Lemma 4.1 with Nx = W .\nAs Nx //H is a cone with vertex point \u2217, it is well-known that\nIH i (Nx //H) = 0\n\nfor i \u2265 nH and if i < nH , we have\nIH i (Nx //H) \u223c\n= IH i (Nx //H \u2212 \u2217) \u223c\n= IH i (Nx \u2212 \u03c6\u22121\nx (\u2217)//H)\nwhere \u03c6x : Nx \u2192 Nx //H is the GIT quotient map and the following diagram\ncommutes:\nIH i (Nx //H) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 IH i (Nx \u2212 \u03c6x\u22121 (\u2217)//H)\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\u03c6\u2217\n\u03c6\u2217\n(8.27)\nx,H y\nx,H y\ni\nHH\n(Nx )\n\ni\nHH\n(Nx \u2212 \u03c6x\u22121 (\u2217))\n\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\n\nAs \u03c6\u22121\nx (\u2217) is the union of the complex cones over the unstable strata of PNx and\nthe real codimension of each unstable stratum is greater than nH by the weakly\nbalanced condition, the real codimension of \u03c6\u22121\nx (\u2217) is greater than nH . Hence, the\nbottom horizontal map is an isomorphism.\nWe claim that the the right vertical in (8.27) is injective and the image is\nVNi \u2212\u03c6\u22121 (\u2217) .

Moreover, if y \u2208 Nx \u2212 \u03c6\u22121\nx (\u2217), the closure of HC * y does not meet\n0 (if it does, the point belongs to \u03c6\u22121\nx (\u2217)) and thus y is semistable as a point in \u0176\nby [Kir85] Remark 7.7.\nBecause the action of H on \u0176 is weakly balanced and r(\u0176 ) < r = r(M ), Theorem\n7.7 is true for \u0176 . In particular, if we apply the theorem for the preimage Nx \u2212\u03c6\u22121\nx (\u2217)\nof the open set \u01eb\u22121 (Nx //H \u2212 \u2217) by \u03b3\u0303 we obtain the isomorphism\nIH i (Nx \u2212 \u03c6\u22121 (\u2217)//H) \u223c\n.\n=Vi\n\u22121\nx\n\nNx \u2212\u03c6x (\u2217)\n\nTherefore, from (8.27), it suffices to show that\nVi \u223c\n=Vi\n\u22121\nNx\n\nNx \u2212\u03c6x (\u2217)\n\nfor i < nH by restriction.
