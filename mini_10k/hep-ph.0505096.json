In some\ncases the unification is done by taking a simple group of grand unification, arising the so called Grand Unification\nTheories (GUT), where the three interactions described by SM are treated as only one [1]-[3], the most common\nGUT's are SO(10) and E6 . The first condition for these kind of theories is an equal value for the three couplings at\ncertain scale of energy, MU . This condition cannot be fulfilled by the simplest grand unification schemes with the\nminimal SM particle content and taking the precision low-energy data. However, the minimal supersymmetric SM\ncan achieve this scenario for the coupling constants [4]-[6]. Other possibilities for unification are the introduction\nof more degrees of freedom like fermions and scalar fields that lead the three couplings to converge at a high energy\nscale [7]. Polychromatic extensions of the SM i.e. SU (N )C \u2297 SU (2)L \u2297 U (1)1/N have been considered where\nthe unification of gauge couplings is achieved with N = 7, 5 and with two, three Higgs doublets, respectively\n[8]. Alternative proposals of unification of quarks and leptons at TeV scale were considered too [9]. Finally,\nanother interesting alternative consists of enlarging the electroweak sector of the SM gauge group such that the\nrenormalization group equations (RGE) could lead to unification of the three gauge couplings at certain scale\nMU , in which there is no necessarily a group of grand unification at the scale of convergence of the couplings. In\nparticular, the model based on the SU (3)C \u2297 SU (3)L \u2297 U (1)X gauge group (hereafter 331 models) is an interesting\nchoice that could address problems like the charge quantization [10]-[11] and the existence of three families based\non cancellation of anomalies [12]-[17].\nOne way to look for new Physics in 331 models is to check for tT production with t denoting the ordinary\ntop quark and T being an exotic quark with charge 2/3 or 4/3 according to the model considered. In LHC the\nproduction channels would be pp \u2192 X 0 \u2192 tT , when the charge of T is 2/3, and pp \u2192 X ++ \u2192 tT , in the case\nin which T has an exotic charge 4/3. In the first case, in order to identify the signals, the decay of t is known\nand identified by the energy spectrum and angular distribution of the final fermions [18]-[20], then this signal is\ncorrelated with the one of an exotic particle with the same charge of the top, but with a totally different decay in\nthe final state. The decays of T would be of the form T \u2192 X 0 t \u2192 \u03bdEt, T \u2192 K + b \u2192 \u03bdEb, which could de easily\nidentifyable if exotic leptons have already been produced at LHC. In the second case in which T has an exotic\n\u2217 radiazs@unal.edu.co\n\u2020 remartinezm@unal.edu.co\n\n\f2\n\nRodolfo A. Diaz, D. Gallego, R. Martinez\n\ncharge 4/3, it should be looked for decays of the type T \u2192 X ++ t where X ++ is a doubly charged gauge field that\nshould be easily identified if this model is correct. The other possible channel is T \u2192 K + b \u2192 \u03bdEb.\nIn the scenario of SUSY 331 models, different channels can be searched. A good perspective is pp \u2192 gg \u2192 g \u2192\ngee\ng where e\ng\u2192e\ntT, tTe, T Te in the case in which T posseses an ordinary charge 2/3. Another production mechanism\nin the gaugino sector is could be pp \u2192 X ++ \u2192 \u03c7++ \u03c70 , pp \u2192 \u03c7++ \u2192 X ++ \u03c70 , pp \u2192 Z, Z \u2032++ \u03c7\u2212\u2212 [21]-[25]\nIn looking for unification of the coupling constant by passing through a 331 model, we shall assume that 1) The\n331 gauge group is the only extension of the SM before the unification of the running coupling constants. 2) The\nhypercharge associated with the 331 gauge group is adequately normalized such that the three gauge couplings\nunify at certain scale MU . and 3) There is no necessarily a unified gauge group at the scale of convergence of the\ncouplings MU . In the absence of a grand unified group, there are no restriction on MU coming from proton decay1 .\nUnder our scheme, we have three characteristic energy scales: MU where the three gauge couplings converge,\nMX where the 331 symmetry is broken, and MZ where the SM breaking occurs. We are going to consider different\nscenarios for 331 models with one and three families2 , i. e., one family models. We also introduce Supersymmetric\nversions of the 331 models with different scalar Higgs multiplets. As for the SUSY breaking, we shall consider two\ndifferent scenarios: when SUSY is broken at the electroweak scale, or when SUSY breaks at the scale of MX .\nIn our scheme we have four parameters to take into account, and to look for a possible unification of the coupling\nconstants (UCC). They are the scales MX , MU , the value of the coupling contants at the unification convergence\npoint, \u03b1U , and the parameter associated with the normalization of the hypercharge (denoted by a). Since we\nare interested mostly in possible phenomenological scenarios, the relevant parameter will be the gauge symmetry\nbreaking scale MX ; and the parameters MU , a can be viewed as functions of this one.\nIf the unification came from a grand unified symmetry group G, the normalization of the hypercharge Y would\nbe determined by the group structure. However, under our assumptions, this normalization factor is free and the\nproblem could be addressed the opposite way, since the values obtained for a could in turn suggest possible groups\nof grand unification in which the 331 group is embedded, we shall explore this possibility as well.\nIn the present work, we study six different versions of 331 models with non-SUSY and SUSY particle content,\nand find which models could lead to a unification at certain scale MU with only one symmetry breaking between MZ\nand MU scales. Some of the SUSY versions studied, could provide a quite natural scenario for split supersymmetry.\nFinally, we also consider the possibility of embedding those 331 versions into a grand unified theory (GUT) in which\na gauge group at the unification scale appears.\n\n2\n\nRunning Coupling Constants\n\nThe evolution for the Running Coupling Constants (RCC) at one-loop order is ruled by the solution of the Renormalization Group Equations (RGE), which can be written in the form [28]:\n\u0012 \u0013\n1\n1\nbi\n\u03bc2\n,\n(2.1)\n=\n\u2212\nln\n\u03b1i (\u03bc2 )\n\u03b1i (\u03bc1 ) 2\u03c0\n\u03bc1\nwhere \u03b1i = gi2 /4\u03c0, and the coefficients bi are given by [29]:\n2X\n1X\n11\nbi =\nTRi (f ) +\nTRi (s) \u2212 C2i (G).\n3\n3 s\n3\n\n(2.2)\n\nf\n\nThe summations run over Weyl fermions and scalars, respectively. The coefficient TR is the Dynkin index\nT r(T a T b )R = TR \u03b4 ab ,\n\n(2.3)\n\nwith the generators in the representation R. The last term is the quadratic Casimir for the adjoint representation\nf acd f bcd = C2 (G)\u03b4 ab ,\nwith C2 (G) = N for SU (N ). On the other hand, the respective supersymmetric versions are\nX\nX\nbSUSY\n=\nTRi (f ) +\nTRi (s) \u2212 3C2i (G).\ni\nf\n\n(2.4)\n\n(2.5)\n\ns\n\nwhere the usual non-supersymmetric degrees of freedom are counted.\n1 Notwithstanding, proton decay could be induced even in the absence of a group of grand unification. It may occurs via six\ndimensional 331 invariant effective operators, that violates barionic and leptonic numbers [27].\n2 331 models with three identical fermion multiplets are usually call one family models.\n\n\f3\n\nRenormalization group in 331 models\n\n2.1\n\nMatching Conditions\n\nThe general expression for the electromagnetic charge operator will be a linear combination of diagonal generators\nfor the gauge group 331:\n2\nQ = T3 + Y = T3 + \u221a bT8 + X\n3\n\n(2.6)\n\nwith Ti the Gell-Mann matrices normalized as T r(Ti Tj ) = 21 \u03b4ij . The X operator for the abelian group U (1)X is\nproportional to the identity matrix 3 \u00d7 3. The hypercharge will be given by\n2\nY = \u221a bT8 + X.\n3\n\n(2.7)\n\nb is a known parameter that determines the class of 331 models to be considered [30].\nThe renormalization group analysis compares the couplings for different gauge groups at given energy scales,\nand models with symmetry breakings need relations for couplings at different energy regions which are called the\nmatching conditions; they are extracted from the way in which the unbroken group is embedded into a bigger\nbroken group. Also, in order to have all couplings in the same ground, all the generators should be normalized in\nthe same way, and well normalized couplings are those which will converge in an unification point.\nCalling \u1ef8 the well-normalized hypercharge operator, it will be proportional to the original one,\nY = a\u1ef8 ,\n\n(2.8)\n\nwhere a is the normalizing parameter so that the convergence of the running coupling constants at certain scale\nMU is guaranteed. In the same way the operator X has a well-normalized X\u0303, i.e. X = cX\u0303, and the normalizing\nparameter for it, is given by Eq.

We shall call it the first unification pattern\n(1UP). In that case, we obtain an allowed region for the scale MX . It is carried out by combining the results\nof Section 2.2. The procedure to get the allowed interval for MX is described in detail in Section 3.1 for the\nso called model A.\n\u278b The scenario with b3C = b3L . We call it (2UP). In such a case Eq. (2.18) is not valid anymore, and we\nshould go back to Eqs. (2.15, 2.16). For an arbitrary value of MX the couplings \u03b13C and \u03b13L go parallel each\nother for energies larger than MX . Therefore, the only possible way to still obtain unification is by setting\n\u03b13C = \u03b13L at the scale MX such that both couplings go together for scales above MX . Unification with the\nthird coupling could occur at any scale bigger than MX . By equating Eqs (2.15, 2.16), we find a single value\nof MX that makes the couplings \u03b13C and \u03b13L to converge. This convergence occurs at the scale\n\" \u0002\n\u0003#\n2\u03c0 \u03b12L (MZ )\u22121 \u2212 \u03b1s (MZ )\u22121\n(2.21)\nMX = MZ exp\n(b2L \u2212 bs )\nIt worths emphasizing that this scenario leads to a unique value of MX and not to an allowed range.

(2.18), the unification scale MU becomes\nindependent of MX .\nThe case (b3C \u2212 b3L ) = (bs \u2212 b2L ) = 0, does not lead to unification as can be seen by trying to equate Eqs.\n(2.15) and (2.16). Since the first scenario is the most commom one, we shall only indicate when the other two\nscenarios appear. We will study non-SUSY and SUSY versions of the 331 models. In the case of SUSY models we\nshall consider two scenarios for the SUSY breaking pattern\n1. The SUSY Breaking Scenario at the Z\u2212pole (ZSBS), in which the SUSY breaking scale is taken as \u039bSUSY \u223c\nMZ . Although this is not a very realistic scenario, numerical results do not change significantly with respect\nto the more realistic scenario with \u039bSUSY lying at some few TeV's.\n2. The SUSY Breaking Scenario at the MX scale (XSBS), with \u039bSUSY \u223c MX i.e. SUSY breaking at the 331\nbreaking scale.\n\n3\n\n331 Models\n\nAnalogously to the SM, fermions will transform as singlets or in the fundamental representation of SU (3)L , and\ngauge fields in the adjoint representation. Assignment of U (1)X quantum numbers should be done ensuring a\nmodel free of anomalies. There are models with three different families necessary to cancel out the anomalies, and\nthere are models with only one family and the other two are a copy of the first. We will take into account six\ndifferent versions of the 331 model for the analysis of the unification scheme.\nThe minimal spectrum necessary for symmetry breaking and generation of masses is given by [32]\n\u03c61 \u223c (1, 3\u2217 , \u22121/3),\n\u03c62 \u223c (1, 3\u2217 , \u22121/3),\n\n(3.1)\n\n\u2217\n\n\u03c63 \u223c (1, 3 , 2/3).\n\nWhere the quantum numbers are associated with SU (3)C , SU (3)L , and U (1)X respectively. The first multiplet\nacquires a vacuum expectation value (VEV) at MX scale, breaking the symmetry as 331 \u2192 321; the other two will\n\n\f6\n\nRodolfo A. Diaz, D. Gallego, R. Martinez\n\nbe decomposed as singlets and doublets of SU (2)L , which will break the 321 symmetry. The spectrum transforms\nlike\n(\n\u03c62SM \u223c (1, 2\u2217 , \u22121/2),\n\u03c62 \u2192\n(3.2)\n\u03c602\n\u223c (1, 1, 0).\n(\n\u03c63SM \u223c (1, 2\u2217 , 1/2),\n\u03c63 \u2192\n(3.3)\n\u03c6+\n\u223c (1, 1, 1).\n2\nThis is applied for models with b = 1/2, with tiny changes that do not affect our analysis [43, 44]. For models with\nb = 3/2 this spectrum should be varied in order to get a phenomenological mass spectrum. For this case we have\nthe following transformation for the triplets [26, 34, 35, 36]:\n\u03b7 \u223c (1, 3\u2217 , 0),\n\n\u03c1 \u223c (1, 3\u2217 , 1),\n\u03c7 \u223c (1, 3\u2217 , \u22121).\n\n(3.4)\n\nthe 331 symmetry is broken when \u03c7 acquires a VEV in the third component. The remaining scalars will transform\nin the 321 symmetry as\n(\n\u03b7SM \u223c (1, 2\u2217 , \u22121/2),\n\u03b7 \u2192\n(3.5)\n\u03b72+\n\u223c (1, 1, 1).\n(\n\u03c1SM \u223c (1, 2\u2217 , 1/2),\n\u03c1 \u2192\n(3.6)\n\u03c1++ \u223c (1, 1, 2).\nThe Model that we will call Model E needs also another scalar boson transforming under 6 representation of\nSU (3)L . Such an structure is required in order to give masses to the neutrinos [26, 34, 35],\nS \u223c (1, 6, 0)\n\n(3.7)\n\nwhich has the following representation in the 321 symmetry:\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\u03c63SM \u223c (1, 3, 1),\nS \u2192 \u03c62SM \u223c (1, 2, 1/2),\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 \u2212\u2212\n\u03c6\n\u223c (1, 1, \u22122).\n\n3.1\n\n(3.8)\n\nModel A\n\nThe simplest anomaly-free structure for this gauge group is generated by taking b = 1/2; and the following spectrum\nis obtained [37]\n\u03c81L\n\u03c82L\n\u03c83L\nQL\nucL\n\n= (e\u2212 , \u03bde , N10 )TL \u223c (1, 3\u2217 , \u22121/3),\n\n= (E \u2212 , N20 , N30 )TL \u223c (1, 3\u2217 , \u22121/3),\n= (N40 , E + , e+ )TL \u223c (1, 3\u2217 , 2/3),\n= (u, d, D)TL \u223c (3, 3, 0),\n\u2217\n\n\u223c (3 , 1, \u22122/3),\n\ndcL\n\n\u2217\n\n\u223c (3 , 1, 1/3),\n\n(3.9)\nc\nDL\n\n\u2217\n\n\u223c (3 , 1, 1/3).\n\nThe other two families are copies of the first one, and each family is free of anomalies. This particular 331 model\ncould be embbeded in the E6 gauge theory, but we shall assume that not necessarily such embedding occurs.\nFrom the general expression for coefficients bi Eq.

(2.19), an allowed region for MX can be found. In Fig. 1 we plot\nMU as a function of MX , Eq. (2.18). We also plot the line MU = MX , and the line MU = 1017 GeV, the intersection\nof these lines with the first plot, provides the allowed region given by the constraints MX \u2264 MU \u2264 1017 GeV\naccording to Eq. (2.19). The intersection between the curve MU (MX ) from Eq. (2.18) with MU = 1017 GeV gives\nthe lower bound for MX , and the intersection with MU = MX gives the upper limit for MX . Then from Fig. 1\nand the hierarchy condition, it is obtained that\n1.63 \u00d7 1016 GeV \u2264 MX \u2264 2.05 \u00d7 1016 GeV .\n\n(3.14)\n\nIn Figure 2 we plot a2 as a function of MX from Eq. (2.20). For this model b = 1/2 and from Eq. (2.10) the\nrestriction a2 \u2265 1/3 is obtained. The horizontal line a2 = 1/3 is also showed and the allowed values are above of\nthis line. In this case the constraint for MX is given by MX \u2264 2 \u00d7 1014 GeV which is weaker than the previous\nrestriction.\nFrom Eq. (2.18) and the allowed interval for MX of Eq. (3.14) we get the region permitted for MU i.e. 2 \u00d7 1016\nGeV \u2264 MU \u2264 1017 GeV.\nNow, for MX = 2.05 \u00d7 1016 GeV (the highest allowed value) we obtain from Eq. (2.18) that MU \u2248 MX which\nis not a natural hierarchy. Instead, for MX = 1.63 \u00d7 1016 GeV (the lowest allowed value) the unification occurs\nat a more natural scale of 1017 GeV. Then, we shall take the latter to plot the evolution of the running coupling\nconstants.\nThe evolution of the RCC described by Eqs. (2.1), requires the results for the matching conditions Eqs. (2.12,\n2.13). Moreover, the following input parameters are necessary: 1 The bi coefficients Eqs. (3.12, 3.13), 2 The\nvalue of the 331 breaking scale MX , and 3 the values of the couplings at Z-pole Eqs. (2.17). Assuming the lowest\nallowed value for the 331 breaking scale (MX = 1.63 \u00d7 1016 GeV) we plot the evolution of the running coupling\nconstants in Fig. 3. The unification scale appears to be MU = 1017 GeV, in agreement with our previous results.\n3.1.1\n\nSUSY Extension\n\nOne possible SUSY extension in which the superpartners cancel the anomalies of their partners, arises by introducing\nnew scalars which transform in the conjugate representations of the original ones. Under these considerations, and\nusing Eqs. (2.5) we obtain the supersymmetric bi coefficients\n(bY , b2L , bs ) = (14, 2, \u22123) ,\n(bX , b3L , b3C ) = (16, 3, 0) .\n\n(3.15)\n(3.16)\n\nWe take first the ZSBS in which SUSY breaking is assumed to occur at EW scale 3 . Since in that case SUSY is\nnot broken by going from EW to the unification scale, we should use the supersymmetric bi coefficients, at scales\n3 Our\n\nresults are also valid for SUSY breaking at scales of the order of 1 TeV.\n\n\f9\n\nRenormalization group in 331 models\n\nbelow and above the 331 breaking scale. Taking it into account, and using the hierarchy condition (2.19), as it was\nexplained in the previous section, we get an allowed range for MX , of\n1.27 \u00d7 108 GeV \u2264 MX \u2264 2.76 \u00d7 1013 GeV.\n\n(3.17)\n\n6\n\nThe bound coming from the a parameter Eq. (2.10), yields 6.43\u00d710 GeV \u2264 MX , which gives no further restriction.\nThis allowed region for MX leads to an allowed interval for MU obtained from Eq. (2.18), getting4\n2.76 \u00d7 1013 GeV \u2264 MU \u2264 1017 GeV\nOn the other hand, we shall consider the XSBS with SUSY breaking at the MX scale. In that case, we should\nuse the non-SUSY bi coefficients for scales below MX , and the SUSY bi coefficients for energies above MX . From\nthis we obtain the following allowed interval for MX\n1.76 \u00d7 1014 GeV \u2264 MX \u2264 2.05 \u00d7 1016 GeV,\n\n(3.18)\n\nfor which the restriction a2 > 1/3 is also satisfied. This allowed region provides a unification scale between\n2.05 \u00d7 1016 GeV and 1017 GeV which correspond to the values calculated from Eq. (2.18) for the lower and upper\nvalues for MX , respectively. Therefore, this is a possible scenario of unification with 331 as the unique intermediate\ngauge group, for both schemes of SUSY breaking.\nIt worths noting that SUSY scenarios leads to much lower breaking scales for the 331 model, especially for low\nenergy SUSY breaking.\nIn another possible supersymmetric extension of model A, the scalar fields are not introduced explicitly. Instead,\nthey appear as superpartners of the leptons, since they have the same representations and quantum numbers [45].\nThe supersymmetric bi coefficients read\n(bY , b2L , bs ) = (10, 0, \u22123) ,\n(bX , b3L , b3C ) = (12, 0, 0) .\n\n(3.19)\n(3.20)\n\nFor both schemes of SUSY breaking, the model correspond to the 2UP explained in Sec.

It discards this SUSY version of model A, to get UCC\nunder our scheme.\n\n3.2\n\nModel B\n\nAgain the parameter b takes the value 1/2, and in this case the 331 gauge theory is a family-symmetric model.

This model has the same spectrum of model A at low energies. Therefore, it has the same values\nfor the bi coefficients at low energies given by Eq.

From\n2.76 \u00d7 1013 GeV \u2264 MU \u2264 1.13 \u00d7 1015 GeV\nwe get a2 = [1/3, 1.67].

Using MU \u2208 2 \u00d7 10 , 10\nThey satisfy the condition a2 \u2265 1/3. Hence, SUSY versions give a possible scenario of unification in our scheme.\n\n4\n\nSome possible scenarios with groups of grand unification\n\nOne of our main assumptions was that there is no necessarily a group of grand unification at the scale in which the\ncoupling constants converge. In this way, the a2 parameter becomes free, and indeed we could reverse the problem\nin a certain way, since we have in many cases an allowed region for a2 and we could ask what groups of grand\nunification (if any) could lead to values of a2 admitted by our scheme. Let us elaborate about this possibility\nAfter working some 331 models with one or three families, we can see that in some of them is possible to find\na scale MX and a normalization factor a2 that gives unification of the coupling constants. In the absence of a\ngroup of grand unification (GUT) a2 is not fixed by the group structure. Notwithstanding, UCC imposes some\nrestrictions on a2 , and by using these values we can look for simple groups containing a 331 group and fixing an\na2 belonging to the allowed interval mentioned above. Some good examples of GUT are E6 , and SU (7).\nThe group E6 can be broken into SU (3)C \u2297 SU (3)L \u2297 SU (3)R or SU (6)L \u2297 SU (2). Models A and B shown\nin this paper could be embedded in this scheme. On the other hand, the 331 models of three families can be\nembedded into SU (7), thus, we shall study the latter scenario in more detail.\n\n\f14\n\nRodolfo A. Diaz, D. Gallego, R. Martinez\n\nThere are different versions of the SU (7) GUT that lead to 331 models according to the irreducible representations (irrep) that cancel anomalies, and the definition of the electric charge or equivalently the linear combination\nof diagonal generators that define the hypercharge (i.e. the normalizing factor a2 ). The combination of irreducible representations free of anomalies, permits to accomodate those 331 models with three families by the\nbranching rules. The additional singlets or exotic fields acquire masses over the MX scale, and do not affect the\n\u03b1\u03b2\nRGE. There are different combinations of anomaly free irreps.

It can be done by comparing the allowed region for a2 in table 3, with the values of a2\nin table 2. The second column shows the allowed interval of a2 obtained in previous sections in the absence of a\ngrand unification group, the third column shows the allowed interval by taking into account additional restrictions\ncoming from proton decay (MU & 2 \u00d7 1016 GeV), that arise when a GUT theory is introduced6 .\nThe restrictions displayed in table 3 for non SUSY versions of models C, D, F; show that they can be embedded\nin SU (7) since the bound a2 \u2265 1/3 is accomplished by all the values of a2 in table 2. Model E (the only one with\nexotic charges studied here) has been ruled out from phenomenological grounds under our scheme. On the other\nhand, from table 3, we see that the a2 parameter is strongly restricted in the SUSY versions of these models, and\nnot all of them can be accomodated in SU (7) according to table 2.\n\n\f16\n\nRodolfo A.

We assume that there is no necessarily a\nsimple gauge group at the MU scale. From the analysis of the renormalization group equations (RGE) we examine\ndifferent 331 models of one and three families as well as their supersymmetric extensions.\nSpecifically, we are supposing that the three different couplings unify at certain scale MU , and a symmetry\nbreaking to a gauge group SU (3)L \u2297 U (1)X occurs at a lower scale MX . Then, a second breaking occurs at the MZ\nscale to arrive at the SM gauge group. We are also assuming that all particles beyond the SM are getting masses\nof the order of MX . Other analyses can be done by supposing that the particle contents are in different thresholds.\nFor our analysis of the RGE, the following conditions are taking into account: \u2776 The hierarchy condition given by\nEq. (2.19) i.e. MX \u2264 MU \u2264 1 \u00d7 1017 GeV, should be satisfied. \u2777 The condition described by Eq. (2.10) should be\n6 There is another correction coming from the new spectrum introduced, but we have assumed that the new heavy modes do not\nalter the RGE significantly.\n\nAllowed interval for MX\nModel\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\n\nNo SUSY\n\u0002\n\u0003\n1.63 \u00d7 1016 , 2.05 \u00d7 1016\n\u0002\n\u0003\n1.63 \u00d7 1016 , 2.05 \u00d7 1016\n\u0002\n\u0003\n2.05 \u00d7 1016 , 3.15 \u00d7 1016\n\u0002\n\u0003\n2.05 \u00d7 1016 , 3.15 \u00d7 1016\nNo allowed\n\u0002\n\u0003\n2.05 \u00d7 1016 , 3.15 \u00d7 1016\n\nNSBS\n\u0002\n\n8\n\n1.27 \u00d7 10 , 2.76 \u00d7 10\nNo allowed\n= 2.76 \u00d7 1013\n\nSBS\n13\n\n\u0003\n\n\u0002\n\u0002\n\n14\n\n1.76 \u00d7 10 , 2.05 \u00d7 1016\n1.76 \u00d7 1014 , 2.05 \u00d7 1016\n= 2.05 \u00d7 1016\n\n= 2.76 \u00d7 1013\n\n= 2.05 \u00d7 1016\n\nNo allowed\n\nNo allowed\n\n= 2.76 \u00d7 1013\n\n= 2.05 \u00d7 1016\n\n\u0003\n\u0003\n\nTable 4: Summary of the results obtained in the paper for the six different 331 models studied, as well as their\ncorresponding SUSY extensions\n\n\fRenormalization group in 331 models\n\n17\n\nfulfilled, where a is the normalization parameter of the hypercharge Y , that leads to the unification of the couplings\nat certain scale. \u2778 There is no neccesarily a grand unification gauge group at the MU scale.\nIn the case of the supersymmetric extensions, the RGE analysis depends on the specific supersymmetric version\nbut also on the supersymmetry breaking scale. In particular, we assume two possible SUSY breaking scenarios:\nSUSY breaking at electroweak scale and SUSY breaking at the scale of 331 breaking. Although SUSY breaking at\nelectroweak scale is not a realistic scenario, numerical results do not change significantly with respect to the more\nrealistic framework with SUSY breaking at some few TeV's.\nBased on the criteria explained above, we can either find an allowed interval for the 331 breaking scale MX\nor rule out the model as a possible grand unified theory under the scheme described above. We summarize the\nresults found in this paper in table 4 for the six different 331 models studied here as well as their SUSY extensions\n(some SUSY extensions that are ruled out have not been included). In many cases, we see that SUSY versions tend\nto give lower allowed values for the 331 breaking scales than their non SUSY counterparts, it could make SUSY\nextensions easier to test from the phenomenological point of view. It worths emphasizing that taking into account\nthat the spectrum out of the SM lies at the MX scale, when assuming that the SUSY breaking occurs at the MX\nscale we are in a natural scenario for split Supersymmetry [46]-[47].\nOn the other hand, we see that models C and D predicts the same allowed intervals for MX in SUSY and non\nSUSY versions. However, SUSY versions predict different values for the normalization parameter a2 .\nIn addition, by finding the allowed values for a2 we can proceed to see what groups of grand unification could\ngive a value of a2 lying in the allowed range. Although the introduction of a group at MU scale introduces new\nsinglets that could lead to tiny changes in the RGE analysis from MX to MU , this procedure helps us to figure\nout what scenarios of grand unification (if any) are possible under our scheme. In particular, we find that some\n331 models with three families, can be properly embedded in a grand unification scenario with SU (7), especially\nin non susy frameworks.\nAs a matter of perspectives, two loops analysis for RGE can be carried out [48] in order to fit the MU scale better,\nespecially taking into account the uncertainty in the starting coupling constants at electroweak scale. However,\nsignificant changes in the allowed regions obtained here are not expected for a well behaved perturbative regime.\nOn the other hand, it is possible to unify the coupling constant associated to U (1) at string scale instead of the\nMU scale [49]-[50].\nFinally, it worths saying that the non allowed models are not neccesarily ruled out. We only can say that they\ncannot produce UCC under the scheme in which 331 is the only gauge symmetry between the MU and SM scales.\nFor instance, it could be possible that they achieve unification by either introducing new physics, or requiring extra\nbreaking steps from the MU scale to SM scale. By introducing new physics, it is possible to get a lower MX scale\nof the order of TeV accesible to the LHC.\n\n6\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nWe thank Colciencias, Fundaci\u00f3n Banco de la Rep\u00fablica, and High Energy Latin American European Network for\nits financial support.\n\nReferences\n[1] H.
