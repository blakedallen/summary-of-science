E. Montgomerya\na\n\nFermi National Accelerator Laboratory,\nP.O. Box 500, Batavia, Illinois 60510, U.S.A.\nThis is a short paper summarising a presentation of the evolution of the Fermilab program for the next five to\nten years. Emphasis is given to the Fermilab accelerator complex, but external collaboration is emphasised.\n\ntarget from the Booster Accelerator at 8 GeV; we\nare eagerly looking forward to the results. During\nthe past year the Neutrino at the Main Injector\n(NuMI) beamline was completed, commissioned,\nand is now operating. The MINOS experiment, a\nlong baseline neutrino oscillation experiment using that beam line, hopes to receive a good fraction of 1020 protons on target by years end. We\nhope soon to mount the MINER\u03bdA neutrino scattering experiment. To complement these immediate endeavours there has also been R&D on muon\ncooling related to future neutrino factories\nFermilab has been a major player in the construction of the interaction region magnets for the\nLarge Hadron Collider (LHC), which is being constructed at CERN in Europe. This has been in\ncollaboration with two other US laboratories and\nwith the KEK laboratory in Japan. Fermilab is\nthe host laboratory for US-CMS, the collaboration which is building the U.S. contributions to\nthe Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment.\nFermilab physicists have enjoyed leadership r\u00f4les\nin the construction project and the computing\nand software program. They are now taking the\nlead in the maintenance and operation. Recently\nan LHC Physics Center (LPC) was initiated; it\nis hoped that this will enable US scientists to enhance their places in the analysis phases of the\nexperiment and that CMS will see increased activity in this vital area.\nThe Laboratory is host to a suite of astroparticle physics experiments which include the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey, The Pierre Auger cosmic\nray observatory, and the Cryogenic Dark Matter\nSearch experiment in the Soudan mine. Each of\n\n1. Introduction\nAn informal public discussion was held near the\nend of the program of presentations at the High\nIntensity Frontier Workshop on Elba in the spring\nof 2005. This was close to the point (July 1,\n2005) at which Fermilab changed its Director. At\nthe time of the discussion, the incoming Director,\nPiermaria Oddone, had made a presentation[1]\ngiving his vision for the laboratory. While outlining the current program and looking toward\npotential directions for collaboration, this presentation and paper leans heavily on Oddone's presentation.\n2. Current Program\nThe future planning at Fermilab is founded on\nthe current accelerator-based physics program.\nThis program is dominated by the Tevatron Collider experiments which enjoy the highest energies available in the laboratory and will continue\nto do so until the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)\ncomes online at CERN later in this decade. At\npresent approximately one f b\u22121 of integrated luminosity has been delivered to each experiment.\nPeak instantaneous luminosities of greater than\n1032 cm\u22122 . sec\u22121 are common and prospects for\nyet higher luminosity are bright.\nThe neutrino program now has several components. The MiniBooNE experiment is searching\nfor neutrino oscillations corresponding to the indications observed by the LSND experiment at\nLos Alamos a few years ago. This experiment\nhas received approximately 6 \u00d7 1020 protons on\n1\n\n\f2\nthese is a world leader and on this base we are developing a new Dark Energy Survey experiment.\nThe experimental programs of the laboratory\nare supported by two excellent theoretical groups\nin particle and particle astrophysics.\nNevertheless, the name of the laboratory contains the word accelerator. It is in accelerator\nR&D for the future, and for the experiments to\ngo with those accelerators, where we have seen\nthe largest number of contributions from the laboratory to this workshop. These are perhaps the\nmost important things we bring to the table.\n3. New Initiatives\nThe overarching goal for the laboratory will be\nto enable the most powerful attack possible on\nthe fundamental science questions by providing\nworld class facilities. These facilities will be integrated in a global network. It is necessary to\ndevelop science and technology for particle and\nastroparticle physics research.\nSpecific goals are to make vital contributions\nduring the next decade to developing a powerful\nnew tool for discovery, the International Linear\nCollider. This will be achieved while maintaining\nthe foremost neutrino program through the development of the NO\u03bdA experiment and enhancements to the Fermilab proton source.\nTo contribute[2] to the International Linear\nCollider, it is now critical to establish, within the\nU.S., world class expertise in super-conducting\nradio-frequency technology. There are facilities at\nFermilab, buildings which exist, which are being\nturned to this goal. The work will be integrated\ninto the global effort. That effort has an immediate aim to generate a conceptual design for the\nmachine by the end of 2006. At that juncture,\nit is hoped that there will be sufficient information to inform the choice of paths forward. If the\ndesign looks as though it fits to both the needs\nof the science and that of the governments then\nit will be important to complete the development\nwork to enable a decision to construct or not as\nearly as possible. If there are major issues, it may\nbe necessary to embark on a longer development\nprogram.\nOn the neutrino front, Fermilab is currently\n\noperating a neutrino program which enjoys the\nmost powerful proton beam available to that end\nin the world. By year end we can see operation\nfor MINOS the long baseline oscillation experiment with a beam power of 200 KW. Upgrades\ncould get that to 450 KW by 2008. If the Tevatron Collider program ends in 2009, that would\nmake in excess of 600 KW available. Imaginative\nideas suggest potential in the 1 MW range at 120\nGeV.\nHowever, the existing complex is old and the\npath beyond 1 MW with that complex is daunting. A new source, dubbed the Fermilab Proton\nDriver[3] (FPD), would alleviate most of these issues and provide a platform for high intensity proton source operation over a range of energies for\nphysics. It is currently envisaged that this FPD\nwould be an 8 GeV super-conducting linear accelerator. At low energy, less than 1 GeV, its concepts are borrowed from the Spallation Neutron\nSource (SNS) being built at Oak Ridge National\nLaboratory. At high energies it would have many\nsimilarities to the Tesla design for the linear collider. There appears to be considerable synergy\nwith the work needed for the ILC.\nThe currently operating MINOS experiment is\nwell matched by the current NuMI beam. That\nbeam with the enhancements outlined above over\nthe next few years could support the search for\n\u03bd\u03bc to \u03bde oscillations with a long baseline. This is\na key to the next step in understanding the neutrino flavor physics. The experiment has been\nnamed NO\u03bdA[4]. Its current design envisages a\nmass of about 20-30 ktonnes of liquid scintillator\nand polyvinyl-chloride tube container. The very\nlong baseline would enable a unique sensitivity to\nthe neutrino mass hierarchy. Thus, NO\u03bdA is seen\nas the second step, after MINOS in a flexible approach to the neutrino physics puzzles. Since the\nfigure of merit involves also the detector sensitivity we also foresee starting a program of R&D\ninto the use of liquid argon technology[5] which\nmight have potential for the phase after NO\u03bdA.\nThe physics that one can achieve with a proton\ndriver is extensive[6]; it could potentially include\nhigh intensity muon, pion and kaon experiments\nas demanded by the science. In fact, when we\nconsider the potential of intense proton sources\n\n\f3\nfor visionary programs such as neutrino factories,\nthe Fermilab Proton Driver could provide an important and broad launch platform.\n\n4. Opportunities for Collaboration\nNo single laboratory is going to do all, or even\nhalf, of particle physics alone and Fermilab recognises that collaboration is essential. This ranges\nfrom the International Linear Collider where Fermilab expects to collaborate on superconducting\ntechnology, in the ILC machine and on the preparations for the experiments.\nThe enhancement of the proton source and the\nR&D towards a Proton Driver already takes from\nthe designs of others and even at this meeting\nsome new opportunities have opened up. It was\nemphasised above that a major component of\nFermilab research, both accelerators and experiments is associated with the LHC program at\nCERN. We are already involved in R&D towards\na luminosity upgrade for that machine and we\nexpect this to continue. Rounding out our accelerator work we have an important but modest\ninvolvement in muon beam cooling and a participation in the MICE experiment.\nOn the experimental side, we have been delighted by the participation from all over the\nworld in the Tevatron Collider program and, to a\nlesser extent, in the neutrino program. We would\nlike to see Fermilab continue as one of the homes\nof the international particle physics community.\nTo that end, many may be receiving invitations\nto join in the NO\u03bdA initiative; we also expect that\nthe liquid argon initiative will lead to collaboration.\nFinally, it is clear that the limited resources\nhave bitten into the kaon based flavor programs\nacross the world. At Fermilab, the recent direction has been toward the measurement of the\ndecay K \u2192 \u03c0\u03bd\u03bd which appears to be the most\nreadily accessible. Since it has not been possible to build such an experiment at Fermilab, we\nintend to conduct discussions as to whether a sensible U.S. participation in such an experiment at\nCERN could be mounted.\n\n5. Summary\nAt Fermilab, we are enjoying an exciting\npresent. There is a very healthy program currently operating with luminosity and intensities\nincreasing regularly and physics results and publications appearing apace.\nFor the future we seek to be host to the International Linear Collider and to build on our\nneutrino program by improving our source and\npreparing the Fermilab Proton Driver.\nTo achieve this we must expand the extent of\nour collaboration with all.\nREFERENCES\n1.
