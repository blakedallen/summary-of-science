Introduction and Survey of Results\nIn this article we bring together several areas of representation theory in a series of interrelated results. The first is the rather established theory of p-modular representations of the\nsymmetric groups, followed by the representation theory of groups of Lie type over the finite\nfield Fp , and, finally, the area of topological quantum field theories (TQFT's) over Fp . The\nlatter have been our original motivation since they appear as constant order reduction in the\nReshetikhin Turaev Theories. In fact, as we shall outline in more detail at the end of in this\nsection, the identities we will find in this article will, for example, imply relations between the\nLescop invariant and the Reshetikhin Turaev invariant for 3-manifolds for p = 5.\nOur results in each area concern resolutions and expansions of p-modular representations\nand invariants into their respective characteristic zero counterparts, and, thus, naturally build\non each other. Let us state the results in order, beginning with the case of the symmetric groups.\n1\n\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification: Primary 57R56, 57M27; Secondary 17B10, 17B37, 17B50, 20B30,\n20C30, 20C20.\n\n1\n\n\fThe Symmetric Groups: The representation theory of the symmetric group Sn in n letters\nover Q (or Z) is well known. The theory is semisimple and the simple representations are\nisomorphic to the Specht modules S \u03c4 , where \u03c4 is a Young diagram with n boxes. They have a\nnatural basis given by Young tablaux, and the Sn -action preserves the free Z-modules (or lattices)\nSZ\u03c4 generated by these basis vectors. Passing to Sp\u03c4 = SZ\u03c4/pSZ\u03c4 we thus obtain representations of\nthe same rank over the field Fp for any given prime p \u2265 3. The Sp\u03c4 , however, are not longer\nirreducible, but they have a unique simple quotient Dp\u03c4 obtained from canonical inner forms on\nthe Specht modules, see [5]. The representations SZ\u03c4 and Dp\u03c4 define characters \u03c7\u03c4 and \u03c6\u03c4p on Sn\nwith values in Z and Fp , respectively. We also denote by \u03c7\u03c4p the p-reduction of \u03c7\u03c4 , which may,\nalternatively, be thought of as the character asscociated to Sp\u03c4 .\nThe relationship between the \"ordinary\" representations Sp\u03c4 or Z and \"ordinary\" characters\n\u03c7\u03c4p or Z and their p-modular counterparts Dp\u03c4 and \u03c6\u03c4p is, even after decades of research, still\nintensely investigated with many open questions remaining. While several algorithms exist for\nexpressing the \u03c7\u03c4p in terms of the \u03c6\u03c4p , fewer results exist for the converse relations, and even\nfewer results relate the modules themselves. The exact modular structure of the Sp\u03c4 in terms of\na modular ordering of the Dp\u03c4 -components has only very recently been uncovered by Kleshchev\nand Sheth in [12] for the special case of Young diagrams \u03c4 with two rows.\nThe first result of this article may be thought of as the inverse relation of the result in [12],\nand it implies a similarly inverse relation for the characters.\nTheorem 1 Let p \u2265 3 be a prime and \u03c4 = [a, b] be the two row Young diagram with row\nlengths a and b with 0 \u2264 a \u2212 b \u2264 p \u2212 2. Consider the sequence of Young diagrams \u03c4j given by\n\u03c42i = [a + ip, b \u2212 ip] and \u03c42i\u22121 = [b + ip \u2212 1, a \u2212 ip + 1], whenever defined. (That is, \u03c40 = \u03c4 = [a, b],\n\u03c41 = [b + p \u2212 1, a \u2212 p + 1], \u03c42 = [a + p, b \u2212 p], \u03c43 = [b + 2p \u2212 1, a \u2212 2p + 1], etc.)\n1. There is a resolution of the modular, simple representation Dp\u03c4 of Sn in terms ordinary\nrepresentations given by an exact sequence of Sn -equivariant maps as follows.\n. . . \u2212\u2192 Sp\u03c42 \u2212\u2192 Sp\u03c41 \u2212\u2192 Sp\u03c40 \u2212\u2192 Dp\u03c4 \u2192 0 .\n\n(1)\n\n2. We have the following expansion of p-modular characters in terms of ordinary characters.\n\u03c6\u03c4p =\n\nX\n\n(\u22121)i \u03c7\u03c4pi ,\n\n(2)\n\ni\u22650\n\nIt is an intriguing fact that the maps in the sequence (1) are powers of generators of sl2 acting\ndually on (Z2 )\u2297n , which, as an Sn -module, contains the permutation modules M \u03c4 . The precise\naction is constructed in Corollary 8 of Section 4, where we prove that it yields a well defined\ncomplex.\nThe proof of exactness of this complex uses the results of [12] and occupies most of Section 5.\nA generalization of Theorem 1 to n-row diagrams using a dual sln is likely to yield more insights\nthe structure of p-modular Specht modules for general Young diagrams. The character identity\n(2) is stated as an immediate consequence in Corollary 13 of Section 6.\nThe Symplectic Groups: The symmetric groups typically appear as or within Weyl groups\nof groups of Lie type. In this article we are particularly interested in the symplectic groups\nSp(2g, M) where M may be R, Z or Fp . There are obvious generalizations of our results to most\nother groups of Lie type, which we leave to the reader.\n2\n\n\fLet H = H1 (\u03a3g , Z) be the fundamental representation of Sp(2g, Z) with symplectic basis\nVk\nha1 , . . . , ag , b1 , . . . , bg i, and denote by V (\u031fk ) \u2282\nH the subrepresentation generated by the\nhighest weight vector a1 \u2227 . . . \u2227 ak . Over R this is the irreducible representation of fundamental\nheighest weight \u031fj = \u01eb1 + . . . + \u01ebj . Denote by Vp (\u031fj ) the respective p-modular reduction, and\n==\nby V p (\u031fj ) the unique irreducible subquotient over Fp generated by the same highest weight\nvector. Let g \u2212 p + 2 \u2264 l \u2264 g and \u02c6l = 2(g \u2212 p + 1) \u2212 l. From Theorem 1 now we derive resolutions\nof Sp-representations that are given by exact sequences as follows.\n==\n\n. . . \u2192 Vp (\u031fl\u22124p ) \u2192 Vp (\u031fl\u0302\u22122p ) \u2192 Vp (\u031fl\u22122p ) \u2192 Vp (\u031fl\u0302 ) \u2192 Vp (\u031fl ) \u2192 V p (\u031fl ) \u2192 0 . (3)\nEvidently, (3) implies similar expansions of Sp-characters, and such expansions also exist for\nother groups of Lie type. The generalization more intersting to us, which in fact implies (3), are\nresolutions of topological quantum field theories (TQFT's).\nIn Lemmas\n2 and 4 of Section 2 we establish the relation between the Sp(2g, Z) weight\nV\u2217\nspaces of H with the Sk -module (Z2 )\u2297k . In Lemma 3 we also give the explicit action of the\nSerre generators of sp2g in the language of the permutation modules. The relation between\nthe weight spaces of V (\u031fk ) and the Specht modules and the respective explicit actions of the\nsp2g -generators on the Young diagrams is derived in Section 3.\nHomological TQFT's: Recall that a TQFT is a functor V : Cob3 \u2192 M\u2212mod from a category\nof 2+1-dimensional cobordisms into a category of free modules over a commutative ring M .\nSpecifically, V assigns to a surface \u03a3 a free M -module V(\u03a3) and to a cobordism between two\nsurfaces an M -linear map between the respective M -modules.\nIn [2] Frohman and Nicas construct a TQFT V F N over M = Z, where the free Z-module for a\nsurface\nis given by the (co)homology of its Jacobian, specifically, V F N (\u03a3) = H \u2217 (Hom(\u03c01 (\u03a3), U (1)), Z) =\nV\u2217\nH1 (\u03a3, Z) . The basics of this construction are reviewed in the beginning of Section 2. Further,\n(j)\nin Section 3, we will recall the decomposition of this TQFT into its irreducible components VZ ,\nwith j = 1, 2, . . . , of V F N . They are again TQFT's over Z and are obtained in [8] from a dual\nLefschetz sl2 -action.\n(j)\nComposing VZ with the canonical (rank-preserving) functor Z\u2212mod \u2192\n\u2192 Fp \u2212mod for\n(j)\nprimes p \u2265 3 we obtain a family of TQFT's Vp over M = Fp . As before, the p-modular TQFT's\n==\nare generally highly reducible. However, they have a unique irreducible TQFT subquotient V (j)\np .\nTheorem 2 For any prime p \u2265 3 and integer k with 0 < k < p we have an exact sequence of\nnatural transformations of TQFT's\n==\n\n. . . \u2192 Vp((i+1)p+ki+1 ) \u2192 Vp(ip+ki ) \u2192 . . . \u2192 Vp(2p\u2212k) \u2192 Vp(k) \u2192 V (k)\n\u2192 0,\np\n\n(4)\n\nwhere we set ki = k for even i and ki = p \u2212 k for odd i.\nThe sequence is constructed from its symmetric group summands in Corollary 9 of Section 4.\nExactness follows in Section 5 from the respective results for Specht modules.\nIn order to see why (3) is indeed a special case of Theorem 2 observe that the mapping\nclass group \u0393g is identical with the group of invertible cobordisms in Cob3 from a surface \u03a3g to\nitself. Hence, any TQFT V entails for every g a representation of \u0393g on V(\u03a3), which, in the case\nof V F N , factors through the symplectic quotient \u0393g \u2192\n\u2192 Sp(2g, Z). The sequence in (3) is now\n3\n\n\fobtained from Theorem 2 by evaluation on a particular surface and using the identifications of\n==\n(j)\n\u223c ==\nSp(2g, Z)-modules, given by VZ (\u03a3g ) \u223c\n= V (\u031fg\u2212j+1 ) and V (j)\np (\u03a3g ) = V p (\u031fg\u2212j+1 ) .\nIn the TQFT framework characters are endowed with an interpretion as topological invariants\nof infinite cyclic covers of closed 3-manifolds. More precisely, let V be any TQFT, M a closed\n3-manifold with b1 (M ) \u2265 1, and \u03c6 : H1 (M ) \u2192\u2192 Z an epimorphism. We define an invariant\nof a pair (M, \u03c6) as follows. Pick any two-sided surface \u03a3 \u2282 M which is dual to \u03c6 , and define\nC\u03a3 = M \u2212 \u03a3 seen as a cobordism from \u03a3 to itself. The value V(M, \u03c6) = trace(V(C\u03a3 )) is now\nindependent of the choice of \u03a3.\nAs an important example, Frohman and Nicas extracted in [2] the Alexander polynomial\n\u2206\u03c6 (M ) as a Lefschetz trace from V F N . Translated into the decomposition of [8] this result says\n(j)\nthat the invariant VZ (M, \u03c6) is the difference of two successive coefficients of the Alexander\npolynomial. Combining this observation with Theorem 2 we derive in the end of Section 6\n==\nthe following relation between these invariants over Z and the respective invariants V (j)\np (M, \u03c6)\nobtained from the irreducible TQFT's over Fp .\nTheorem 3 Let \u2206\u03c6 (M ) \u2208 Z[x, x\u22121 ] be the Alexander Polynomial of a closed, compact, oriented\n3-manifold M with respect to an epimorphism \u03c6 : H1 (M ) \u2192\n\u2192 Z.\n==\nLet \u2206 \u00b1\n(M\n)\nbe\nthe\nreduction\nof\n\u2206\n(M\n)\nobtained\nby\nsubstituting\nx = \u00b1\u03b6p , with \u03b6p a p-th\n\u03c6\n\u03c6,p\nroot of unity, and taking the Z coefficients modulo p.

In Section 7 of this article we will also consider extensions\nof these TQFT's with slightly smaller kernels, at least at the level of representations of \u0393g .\nIn [16] Morita constructs a homomorphism k\u0303 : \u0393g \u2192 Sp(2g, Z) \u22c9 21 U which has a smaller\nkernel Kg \u2282 Ig , and whose image Qg \u223c\n= \u0393g /Kg has finite index in Sp(2g, Z) \u22c9 21 U . It extends\nthe Johnson homomorphism Tg \u2192\u2192 U previously constructed in [6], where U denote the free\nV3 .\nabelian group U \u223c\n= H \u03c9\u2227H \u223c\n= V (\u031f3 ). As before we denote H = H1 (\u03a3g ), considered as an\nV2\n\nSp-module, and we let \u03c9 \u2208 H be the standard Sp-invaraiant symplectic form.\nNon-trivial representations of Qg are readily obtained in Proposition 15 of Section 7 as the\nextension of a pair of representations V (\u031fl ) and V (\u031fl+3 ) using the (up to scale unique) Spequivariant map U \u2192 Hom(V (\u031fl ), V (\u031fl+3 )). We prove that these extension also exist for\n==\nthe irreducible p-modular representations V p (\u031fl ). In TQFT language this translates to the\nfollowing result.\n==\n\nTheorem 4 For 0 < k < p \u2212 3 there are indecomposable representations U (k)\np (\u03a3g ) of the mapping class group \u0393g that factor through Qg = \u0393g /Kg but represent the Torelli group Ig nontrivially.

Thus, in order to put the TQFT's of this\narticle into their broader context and illustrate their relevance let us briefly sketch the pertinent\nrelations and results from other work in quantum topology.\ncan be written as\nIt is shown by Gilmer in [3] that, for a restricted set of cobordisms, V\u03b6RT\np\na TQFT over the ring of cyclotomic integers Z[\u03b6p ]. For the Reshetikhin Turaev invariants of\nclosed 3-manifolds this integrality property was previously proved in [17, 13].\nApplying the ring reduction Z[\u03b6p ] \u2192\u2192 Fp , with \u03b6p 7\u2192 1, we obtain a TQFT VpI over the finite\nfor a given p. It is now natural to ask whether or not there exists a relationship\nfield Fp from V\u03b6RT\np\n==\n\nbetween the VpI and the V (j)\np , since they are both TQFT's over Fp and are conjectured to share\na list of other features.\nIdentifications between the TQFT's VpI obtained from quantm groups on the one hand and\nthe ones obtained from the homological theory VpF N (and their Johnson Morita extensions) on the\nother hand will entail many insights into the relation between classical and quantum invariants\nas well as establish natural bases for the quantum theory in the language of the tensor calculus\nof the symplectic groups. Moreover, we expect this to lead to a deeper understanding of the\ngeometric interpretations of the higher order terms in the cyclotomic integer expansions of the\nReshetikhin Turaev theories, which include the Ohtsuki and, particularly, the Casson-WalkerLescop invariants.\nare \"unitarizable\" theories and the dimensions of the vector spaces do not\nSince the V\u03b6RT\np\n==\n\nmatch any combination of ordinary Sp-representations we must expect the simple quotients V (j)\np\n(j)\n\nto enter the relations rather than the reducible TQFT's Vp . This is precisely the point where the\nmain results of this article are crucially needed. The resolutions of p-modular TQFT's provide\nthe missing link between the classical invariants defined over Z and the quantum invariants\ndefined over Fp .\n5\n\n\fThus far we are able to understand these relations and their applications in a rather detailed\nmanner for p = 5. We state next the main result from [10].\nTheorem 5 ([10]) We have the following isormophism of \u0393g -representations over F5 :\n==(1)\nV5I (\u03a3g ) \u223c\n= U 5 (\u03a3g ) .\n\n(6)\n\nIn particular, for pairs (M, \u03c6) as in Theorem 3 we have\n==(1)\n\n==(4)\n\nV5I (M, \u03c6) = V 5 (M, \u03c6) + V 5 (M, \u03c6) = \u22122 * \u03bbLescop (M )\n\nmod 5\n\n(7)\n\nThe first equality in (7) follows directly from (6). The second equality is now a consequence\nof the identification with the Alexander polynomial at a root of unity from Theorem 3. It is\nused in [9] to identify V5I (M, \u03c6) with the F5 -reduction of the Lescop invariant \u03bbLescop (M ) . This\nidentity is special to p = 5 and does not hold for p > 5.\nObserve also that (7) implies that the invariant V5I (M, \u03c6) is really independent of \u03c6. This is\nnot surprising since it is also equal to the lowest oder non-vanishing coefficient of the cyclotomic\ninteger expansion of V\u03b6RT\n(M ). Nevertheless, this raises an interesting question, namely, which\n5\n==\nlinear or polynomial combinations of the V (j)\np (M, \u03c6) are independent of the choice of \u03c6 and,\nthus, yield true invariants of closed 3-manifolds.\nDimensions, Combinatorics, and Asymptotics: An important special case for any character formula is the implied relation for the dimensions of modules, that is, the characters\nevaluated at the unit element. The dimensions of the irreducible modules over F5 in this article\nare Fibonacci numbers, while the dimensions of the corresponding modules over Z are Catalan\nnumbers. As a result we obtain in (54) and (55) of Section 6 identities that express the Fibonacci\nnumbers as 5-periodic, alternating sums in these Catalan numbers. Despite the simplicity of\nthese relations they appear to be unknown in the available literature.\nWe also determine in Section 6 the asymptotics of the dimensions of the TQFT modules for\ng \u2192 \u221e, which is summarized in the following lemma.\nLemma 1 For a fixed prime p \u2265 3 and fixed j, the dimensions of the vector spaces grow for\nlarge g as follows:\ndim(VpI (\u03a3g )) \u223c const. * kFFp kg\n\nand\n\n==\n\ng\ndim( V (j)\np (\u03a3g )) \u223c const. * kff p k\n\n\u03c0\np\nand\nkff p k = 4 cos2 ( ) .\n2 \u03c0\n2p\n4 sin ( p )\nMoreover, there are polynomials Rj (f ) \u2208 Z[f ] of degree deg(Rj ) =\n\nwhere\n\n(8)\n\nkFFp k =\n\np\u22123\n2\n\nwith\n\nkFFp k = Rp (kff p k) .\n\n(9)\n\nThe polynomial dependence between the asymptotic behaviors from (9) suggests a similar \"polynomial\" dependence between the TQFT's. If the products of the dimensions are replaced by\ntensor products of the respective TQFT's, this suggests that \u223c Rp (kff p k)g describes the asymp==(j)\ntotics of parts of an p\u22123\n2 -fold tensor product of the V p . We are thus led to the following\nconjecture on the constant order structure of the Reshetikhin Turaev theory, which can be\nverified for the genus=1 mapping class group (SL(2, Z)) representations.\nConjecture 6\np\u22123\n\nThe irreducible components of VpI can be found as irreducible components of\n6\n\n2\nO\n==\n\nV Fp N .\n\n\fAcknowledgements:\nI am much indebted to Alexander Kleshchev for pointing out his\nresults in [12], and to Gordon James and Alain Reuter for checking the arguments in Section 5.\nI thank Ronald Solomon, Stephen Rallis, Adalbert Kerber, and Charles Frohman for comments\nand interest.

Frohman-Nicas TQFT's over Z\nIn [2] Frohman and Nicas construct a TQFT that allows the interpretation of the Alexander\nPolynomial as a weighted Lefschetz trace. The vector spaces are the cohomology rings of the\nJacobians of the surfaces. In [8] we extract a natural Lefschetz SL(2, R)-action on these spaces,\nwith respect to which this TQFT is equivariant. Let us describe in this sections the basic\ningredients of the Frohman Nicas theory, reviewing also the conventions of [8].\nr\nWe denote by Cob22f\nthe category of evenly framed cobordisms between connected standard\n3\nsurfaces \u03a3g . These are essentially the cobordisms obtained by an even number of surgeries, see\nLemma 10, [8]. The Frohman Nicas TQFT is then given as a functor\nr\nV F N : Cob22f\n\u2212\u2192 SL(2, R) \u2212 modR ,\n3\n\nfor which\nV F N (\u03a3g ) =\n\n(10)\n\nV\u2217\n\nH1 (\u03a3g )\n\nfor the surface \u03a3g of genus g. For each surface we pick a symplectic basis {a1 , . . . , ag , b1 , . . . , bg }\nfor H1 (\u03a3g ) and introduce the inner form h , i, for which this basis orthonormal. We denote i\u2217 :\nH1 (\u03a3g ) \u2192 H1 (\u03a3g+1 ) the inclusion map compatible with the choice of bases and the construction\nof \u03a3g+1 from \u03a3g by handle addition.\nV\u2217\nThe bases naturally provide lattice bases for H1 (\u03a3g , Z), given by monomials in the ai and\nbi . Moreover, the inner form extends to to the exterior product\nto make the monomial basis an\nV2\nPg\northonormal one. V\nWe also denote by \u03c9g = i=1 ai \u2227 bi \u2208 H1 (\u03a3g , Z) the symplectic form. The\n\u2217\nsl(2, R)-action on H1 (\u03a3g ) is given in terms of the standard generators E, F , and H as\nH\u03b1 = (j \u2212 g)\u03b1\n\n\u2200\u03b1 \u2208\n\nVj\n\nE\u03b1 = \u03b1 \u2227 \u03c9g ,\n\nH1 (\u03a3g ) ,\n\nF = E\u2217 .\n\n(11)\n\nV\u2217\n\nFrom the explicit actions of the generators in [8] we see that the lattices H1 (\u03a3g , Z) are prer\nserved by the maps V F N (M ) for cobordisms M in Cob22f\n. Moreover, also the standard gen3\nerators of sl(2, R) preserve the lattices. Hence also the universal enveloping algebra over Z\ngenerated by the operators in (11), which we shall (abusively) denote by sl(2, Z). We denote\nthe respective functor into Z-modules by:\nr\nVZ : Cob22f\n\u2212\u2192 sl(2, Z) \u2212 modZ ,\n3\n\n(12)\n\nr\nMore specifically, the extension of the mapping class group in Cob22f\nfactors\n3\nV\u2217 under VZ\nthrough a split F2 = Z/2Z extension of Sp(2g, Z), acting in the natural way on H1 (\u03a3g , Z).\nWe also denote by sp(2g, Z) the algebra over Z generated by the standard Sp(2g, R) Lie algebra\ngenerators. It is not hard to show that in this representation it coincides with the group algebra\n\n7\n\n\fr\nZ[Sp(2g, Z)]. Besides the mapping class groups the other generators of Cob22f\nare the handle\n3\n+\n\u2212\nattachment cobordisms Hg : \u03a3g \u2192 \u03a3g+1 and Hg : \u03a3g+1 \u2192 \u03a3g with actions given by\n\nVZ (Hg+ ) : \u03b1 7\u2192 i\u2217 (\u03b1) \u2227 ag+1\n\nand\n\nVZ (Hg\u2212 ) = VZ (Hg+ )\u2217 ,\n\n(13)\n\nwhere we use the notation i\u2217 also for the inclusion H1 (\u03a3g ) \u0592\u2192 H1 (\u03a3g+1 ) extended to the exterior\npowers.\nThe structure of VZ and the dual sl(2, Z)-action can be better understood if we decompose\nthe lattices VZ (\u03a3g ) according to sp(2g, Z)-weights. We write an sp(2g)-weight in the standard\nP\nbasis \u03bb = gi=1 \u03bbi \u01ebi as given in [4]. Specifically, we have hai = h\u01ebi , hiai and hbi = \u2212h\u01ebi , hibi for\nh \u2208 h, the diagonal matrices in sp(2g, Z).\n\u2217\nV\u2217 We denote by \u2207g = {\u03bb \u2208 h : \u03bbi \u2208 {\u22121, 0, 1}} the set of possible weights of vectors in\nH1 (\u03a3g ). This yields a decomposition into weight spaces denoted as follows.\nM\n\nVZ (\u03a3g ) =\n\nWZ (\u03bb, g)\n\n(14)\n\n\u03bb\u2208\u2207g\n\nFor a given weight \u03bb \u2208 \u2207g let N (\u03bb) = {i : \u03bbi = 0} \u2282 {1, . . . , g} and n(\u03bb) = |N (\u03bb)|. A special\nvector w(\u03bb) \u2208 WZ (\u03bb, g) is given by\nw(\u03bb) = w1 (\u03bb1 ) \u2227 . . . \u2227 wg (\u03bbg ) \u2208\n\nVg\u2212n(\u03bb)\n\nH1 (\u03a3g )\n\nwhere\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\nwi (1) = ai\nwi (\u22121) = bi\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\nwi (0) = 1\n\n.\n\nLet e\u00b1 be generators of a 2-dimensional lattice he\u2212 , e+ iZ , and LnZ = he\u2212 , e+ i\u2297n\nZ the lattice of\nrank 2n . Given N (\u03bb) = {j1 , . . . , jn(\u03bb) } with j1 < . . . < jn(\u03bb) we thus define maps\n\u03a5\u03bb\n\n:\n:\n\nn(\u03bb)\n\nLZ\n\n\u223c\n=\n\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\n\nWZ (\u03bb, g)\n\n(15)\n\ne\u01eb1 \u2297 . . . \u2297 e\u01ebn 7\u2192 w(\u03bb) \u2227 oj1 (\u01eb1 ) \u2227 . . . \u2227 ojn (\u01ebn )\nwhere n = n(\u03bb) and\n\n(\n\noj (+) = aj \u2227 bj\noj (\u2212) = 1\n\n.\n\nThe lattices LnZ also have a natural inner product for which the monomials e\u01eb1 \u2297 . . . \u2297 e\u01ebn\nform an orthonormal basis, and carry a natural sl(2, Z)-action given by Ee\u2212 = e+ , F e+ = e\u2212 ,\nHe\u00b1 = \u00b1e\u00b1 , and Ee+ = F e\u2212 = 0, for which also E \u2217 = F and H \u2217 = H.\nLemma 2 The \u03a5\u03bb are sl(2, Z)-equivariant isomorphisms of lattices with inner forms.\nProof: They are obviously isomorphisms of lattices as they map orthonormal bases to each\nPn(\u03bb)\nother. It is also easy to see that the H-weight for a monomial is \u2212n(\u03bb) + 2 i=1 \u01ebi on both sides\nP\nof (15). Now, E is multiplication with \u03c9g = j aj \u2227 bj . Clearly, w(\u03bb) \u2227 aj \u2227 bj = 0 if j 6\u2208 N (\u03bb)\nPn(\u03bb)\n\nPn(\u03bb)\n\nso we multiply only with \u03c9\u03bb = i=1 aji \u2227 bji = i=1 oji (+). The E-equivariance then follows\nfrom oj (+) \u2227 oj (+) = 0 and oj (\u2212) \u2227 oj (+) = oj (+). F -equivariance follows from F \u2217 = E.\n\nAlthough not of immediate necessity for the main result let us record here also how the\nactions of morphisms VZ (M ) on the lattices LnZ look like. We give them in terms of generators\nof sp(2g, Z) and the handle attaching maps. We introduce sl(2, Z)-equivariant morphisms\nLnZ \u2212\u2192 Ln+2\nZ\n\ncoevk = Ik\u22121 \u2297 coev \u2297 In\u2212k :\n8\n\n(16)\n\n\fcoev : 1 7\u2192 (e\u2212 \u2297 e+ \u2212 e+ \u2297 e\u2212 )\n\nwhere\n\nand\n\nIn = idLnZ .\n\n\u2212\u2192 LnZ\nevk = \u2212(coevk )\u2217 : Ln+2\nZ\n\nand\nThe obey relation\n\nevk\u00b11 \u25e6 coevk = I\n\nevk \u25e6 coevk = \u22122 * I .\n\nand\n\nn(\u03bb\u2032 )\n\nn(\u03bb)\n\n\u2192 LZ\n. Moreover,\nFor a map \u03c6 : WZ (\u03bb, g) \u2192 WZ (\u03bb\u2032 , g\u2032 ) we denote \u03c6\u03a5 = \u03a5\u22121\n\u03bb\u2032 \u25e6 \u03c6 \u25e6 \u03a5\u03bb : LZ\nas in [4], we denote the standard standard generators e\u03b1i and f\u03b1j of sp(2g, Z) for simple roots\n\u03b1i = \u01ebi \u2212 \u01ebi+1 for i < g and \u03b1g = 2\u01ebg . We have e\u03b1i ai+1 = ai , e\u03b1i bi = \u2212bi+1 , and e\u03b1i v = 0 for\nall other basis vectors v if i < g. Also e\u03b1g bg = eg and e\u03b1g v = 0 for all others. This further\ndetermines the action of the other generators with f\u03b1i = e\u2217\u03b1i .\nDenote now by e\u03b1,\u03bb the restriction e\u03b1 : WZ (\u03bb, g) \u2192 WZ (\u03bb + \u03b1, g), where we put e\u03b1,\u03bb = 0\nof \u03bb + \u03b1 6\u2208 \u2207g .

Lefschetz Decompositions and Specht Modules\nAs in [8] we consider the decomposition of the Frohman Nicas TQFT according to SL(2, R)representations:\nM\nVj \u2297 V (j) ,\nVZF N =\nj\u22651\n\nwhere Vj is the j-dimensional irreducible representation of SL(2, R). Note, that we the convention we use here for the superscript in V (j) is shifted by one from the one used in [8]. For\nweights we follow the notations of [4].

We\nlargely follow here the definitions and notations of [5]. First we note that ker(H + j \u2212 1) is\nnaturally isomorphic to the permutation module M [a,b] , where n(\u03bb) = a + b and j = a \u2212 b + 1.\n\u223c\n=\n\nn(\u03bb)\n\nThe isomorphism M [a,b] \u2212\u2192 ker(H + j \u2212 1) \u2229 LZ\n\ni1 i2 ... ia\nj1 ... jb\n\nmaps a tabloid {t} =\n\nto\n\nthe basis vector e{t} = e\u01eb1 \u2297 e\u01eb2 \u2297 . . . \u2297 e\u01ebN with \u01ebk = + if k \u2208 {j1 , . . . , jb } and \u01ebk = \u2212 if\nk \u2208 {i1 , . . . , ia }. It is obvious that the e{t} indeed span ker(H + j \u2212 1). Consider a tableau\nt = i1 * * * ib ib+1 * * * ia of shape [a, b]. Let C be the column stabilizer group and\nj1\n\nt\n\njb\n\n\u03bat =\n\nX\n\nsign(\u03c0)\u03c0 =\n\n\u03c0\u2208Ct\n\nb\nY\n\n(1 \u2212 (ik , jk ))\n\n(24)\n\nk=1\n\nthe signed column sum. We set et = \u03bat e{t} . The Specht module S [a,b] is the space generated\nby these et and we want to show that it coincider with ker(F ). The easy part is to show S [a,b] \u2282\nP\nker(F ). Using that F commutes with \u03bat we compute F et = F \u03bat e{t} = \u03bat F e{t} = bk=1 \u03bat e{tk } ,\nwhere {tk } is the tabloid of shape [a + 1, b \u2212 1], in which we have removed jk from the bottom\nrow and added to the top row. As a result (1 \u2212 (ik , jk )){tk } = 0, hence \u03bat {tk } = 0 so that\nF et = 0.\nIn order to prove ker(F ) \u2282 S [a,b] we proceed by induction. ker(F ) on M [a,b] is given by\nker(F 2 ) on M [a\u22121,b] . We have a map\nker(F 2 ) \u2229 M [a\u22121,b] \u2212\u2192 ker(F ) \u2229 M [a,b] :\n\nx 7\u2192 e\u2212 \u2297 x \u2212 e+ \u2297 F x .\n\nIt is easy to see that this map is an isomorphism. We use first that F x \u2208 ker(F ) \u2229 M [a,b\u22121]\nP\nand hence by induction F x =\nt\u2208T bt et . Here T is the set of tableaux of the form t =\ni1\nib\u22121 ib * * * ia\n***\nwith numbers from {2, 3, . . . , a + b}. Now as b \u2212 1 < a we have that\nj1\n\njb\u22121\n\nia is not permuted by Ct . Thus if we denote Ej = I\u2297j\u22121 \u2297 E \u2297 I\u2297N \u2212j we have that Eia commutes\nwith \u03bat . Let ht = \u03bat Eia e{t} Now F ht = F Eia \u03bat e{t} = [F, Eia ]\u03bat e{t} + Eia F \u03bat e{t} = \u2212Hia \u03bat e{t}\nsince et \u2208 ker(F ) as shown above. Now, Hia commutes with \u03bat and Hia e{t} = \u2212e{t} by conP\nstruction. Hence F ht = et In other words S [a,b\u22121] \u2282 im(F ). Consider now y = x \u2212 t\u2208T bt ht .\nP\nWe thus have y \u2208 ker(F ) \u2229 M [a\u22121,b] so that by induction y = s\u2208S cs es , where S denotes the\ntableau of the form s = k1 * * * kb kb+1 * * * ka\u22121 with all numbers in {2, 3, . . . , a+ b}.

To this end it is convenient to use tableaux in which entries are takes from the set\nN (\u03bb) rather than {1, . . . , n(\u03bb)}, related to the standard ones by application of \u03c0N (\u03bb) . We denote\nthe set of these tableaux by T (j) (\u03bb).\n(j)\n\nLemma 6 The sp(2g, Z)-generators act on the tableau vectors of Specht modules in the VZ TQFT as follows. For the e\u03b1i ,\u03bb with 1 \u2264 i \u2264 g \u2212 1 we have:\n1. If (\u03bbi , \u03bbi+1 ) = (0, 1) then e\u03b1i ,\u03bb et = es where s \u2208 T (j) (\u03bb + \u03b1i ) is obtained from t \u2208 T (j) (\u03bb)\nby replacing the label i \u2208 N (\u03bb) in t by the label i + 1 \u2208 N (\u03bb + \u03b1i ).\n2. If (\u03bbi , \u03bbi+1 ) = (\u22121, 0) then e\u03b1i ,\u03bb et = \u2212es where s \u2208 T (j) (\u03bb+\u03b1i ) is obtained from t \u2208 T (j) (\u03bb)\nby replacing the label i + 1 \u2208 N (\u03bb) in t by the label i \u2208 N (\u03bb + \u03b1i ).\n3. If (\u03bbi , \u03bbi+1 ) = (\u22121, 1) we have {i, i + 1} = N (\u03bb + \u03b1i ) \u2212 N (\u03bb) and e\u03b1i ,\u03bb et = es where\ns \u2208 T (j) (\u03bb + \u03b1i ) by adding a column\n\ni\ni+1\n\nto t \u2208 T (j) (\u03bb)\n\n4. If (\u03bbi , \u03bbi+1 ) = (0, 0) so that {i, i + 1} = N (\u03bb) \u2212 N (\u03bb + \u03b1i ) then e\u03b1i ,\u03bb et , with t \u2208 T (j) (\u03bb), is\n(a) 0 if the labels i and i + 1 occur in columns of height 1.\n(b) 2es if t is given by adding the column\n\ni\ni+1\n\nto s.\n\n(c) es if i and i + 1 occur in different columns of height 2.\nHere s is obtained from t by replacing the double column\n\nk\ni\n\nl\ni+1\n\nby\n\nl\nk\n\n(d) es if i is in column of height 2 and and i + 1 in columns of height 1, where s is\nobtained from t by deleting the column\n\ni\nk\n\nand replacing\n\ni+1\n\nby\n\nk\n\n(e) es if i + 1 is in column of height 2 and and i in columns of height 1, where s is\nobtained from t by deleting the column\n\nk\ni+1\n\nand replacing\n\ni\n\nby\n\nk\n\nAll other cases of positions of i and i + 1 follow from the symmetry properties of the vectors et\nunder permutations of columns or within columns. Since N (\u03bb + \u03b1g ) = N (\u03bb) if \u03bb + \u03b1g , \u03bb \u2208 \u2207g\nwe have that e\u03b1g ,\u03bb acts as identity also on the vectors et .

Since the weight spaces are all orthogonal to each other these subspaces can be defined\nalso as the null spaces from the respective restriction of the inner forms. Now, also the Specht\nmodules S \u03c4 for a diagram \u03c4 = [a, b] inherit an inner form from the permutation module M \u03c4 ,\nwhich is via the isometry \u03a5 compatible with the one on the weight spaces. As in the standard\nliterature, e.g., [5], we set\n\u03c4. \u25b3\n\nDp\u03c4 = Sp\n\nS \u03c4p\n\nwhere\n\n\u25b3\n\nS \u03c4p = Sp\u03c4 \u2229 Sp\u03c4 \u22a5\n\nand Sp\u03c4 is the p-reduction of S \u03c4 . They are related to irreducible TQFT's as follows.\n==\n\nLemma 8 Let p \u2265 3 be a prime. The TQFT's V (j)\np are irreducible over Fp and the weight\nc\nspaces are identified as Wg -modules by equivariant isomorphisms:\n:\n\u03a5(j)\np\n\nbg\nW\n\nInd b\n\nbn\nWg\u2212n \u00d7W\n\n\u0010\n\n, n\u2212j+1\n]\n[ n+j\u22121\n2\n2\n\nMpg\u2212n \u2297 Dp\n\n\u0011\n\n\u223c\n\n=\n\u2212\u2192\n\n==(j)\nW p (n, g)\n\n.\n\n(25)\n\nProof: The isomorphism in (25) follows from the definitions and properties of \u03a5(j) . We first\n==\nshow that the spaces W (j)\np (n, g) are irreducible with respect to the semidirect product Xg of the\nc g ] \u2282 Z[Sp(2g, Z)].\nCartan algebra Z[hg ] \u2282 sl(2g, Z) and the algebra of the Weyl group Z[W\nP\n==(j)\nFor any vector v =\n\u03bb v\u03bb \u2208 W p (n, g) the action of hg shows that each weight compo==(j)\n==\nnent v\u03bb \u2208 W p (\u03bb, g) has to lie in Xg v. Each W (j)\np (n, g) is a module of a symmetric group\n14\n\n\f[ n+j\u22121 , n\u2212j+1 ]\n\n2\nc g \u2282 Xg which is equivalent to Dp 2\nSn \u2282 W\n. It now follows from Theorem 4.9 in [5]\nthat these representations are irreducible. In fact, as p \u2265 3 any two-row diagram is p-regular\nso that these representations are never zero, see Theorem 11.1 in [5]. In particular, if v\u03bb 6= 0\n==\nthen Z[Sn ]v\u03bb is the entire module. Hence, for v 6= 0 we must have W (j)\np (\u03bb, g) \u2282 Xg v for at\nc\nleast one \u03bb \u2208 \u2207g with n(\u03bb) = n. Since Wg acts transitively on all of such weights and pro==\nvides isomorphisms between the weight spaces we thus have W (j)\np (n, g) = Xg v, which implies\n==(j)\nirreducibility since v was arbitrary. A submodule of V p (\u03a3g ) must therefore be a direct sum\n==\ng\nof the W (j)\np (n, g). Each of these contains a special vector wn = \u03a5\u031fg\u2212j+1 (et(n,j) ) with t(n, j) =\n1\n3\n* * * m\u22121m+1 * * * n where m = n \u2212 j + 1. Using \u03ba2\n= 2m \u03ba\nfor the antisym-\n\n2\n\n4\n\nt(n,j)\n\nm\n\nt(n,j)\n\nmetrizer (24), we find hwng , wng ip = het(n,j) , et(n,j) ip = 2m he{t(n,j)} , \u03bat e{t(n,j)} ip = 2m 6\u2261 0 mod p\n==\nfor p \u2265 3 so that all of these vectors are non-zero in W (j)\np (n, g). It can be computed from\ng\ng\ng\n,\nand e\u03b1g\u2212n+1 wng = 2wn+2\nthe rules 3. and 4.(b) in Lemma 6 that e\u03b1g\u2212n\u22121 Sg\u2212n\u22121 wn = wn\u22122\nwhere Sl \u2208 Wg maps aj to \u2212bj so that with 2 6\u2261 0 mod p we have non-trivial maps between\n==\nall of the irreducible Xg -components. Consequently, the V (j)\np (\u03a3g ) are irreducible as sp(2g, Z)representations and any sub-TQFT must assign either this space or 0 to a surface \u03a3g . As in [8]\nwe easily check that the handle attachment maps are non-trivial between these spaces so that\n==(j)\nV p does in fact contain no proper sub-TQFT.\nWe next construct a sequence of maps between the p-reductions of the Specht modules, using\nthe sl(2, Z)-actions.

The irreducible factors of Sp\u03c4 for two row diagrams \u03c4 are\ndetermined in Theorem 24.15 of [5]. For our proof we will, however, have to make use also of\nthe precise submodule structure, which turns out to be rather rigid. We use the recent result of\nKleshchev and Sheth in [12] that describes this structure precisely. In order to state it we need\nto introduce some more conventions and definitions.\n16\n\n\fFor a Young diagram \u03c4 = [a, b] we set c = a \u2212 b + 1, and consider the p-adic expansion\nc = c0 + c1 p + c2 p2 + . . . + cr pr\n\nwith\n\ncj \u2208 {0, 1, . . . , p \u2212 1} .\n\n(29)\n\nAs in [12] we denote by \u00c2\u03c4 the family of sets of integers of the form\nI = [i1 , i2 ) \u222a [i3 , i4 ) \u222a . . . \u222a [i2u\u22121 , iut )\nsuch that\n\ni1 < i2 < . . . < i2u\n\nci2j\u22121 6= 0\n\n,\n\nand\n\n(30)\nci2j 6= p \u2212 1.\n\n(31)\n\nFor such a set I \u2208 A\u03c4 we define as in [12]the number\n\u03b4I\u03c4 =\n\nX\n\n(p \u2212 1 \u2212 ci )pi +\n\n\u03c4\n\u03b4[u,w)\n=\n\npi2j\u22121 =\n\nj=1\n\ni\u2208I\n\nwhere\n\nu\nX\n\nu\nX\n\n\u03b4[i\u03c4 2j\u22121 ,i2j ) ,\n\n(32)\n\nj=1\n\nw\u22121\nX\n\n(p \u2212 1 \u2212 ci )pi + pu .

We have\neasy to see that \u03b4[0,k\n\u03c4]\nthe following simple but crucial observation.\nLemma 10 With \u03c4 and \u03c4 \u2032 as above we have a well defined bijection with inverse\n: I 7\u2192 I \u2212 [0, k\u03c4 )\n\u03c6 : \u00c20\u03c4 \u2032 \u2212\u2192 \u00c2+\n\u03c4\n\nand\n\n0\n\u03c6\u22121 : \u00c2+\n\u03c4 \u2212\u2192 \u00c2\u03c4 \u2032 : J 7\u2192 J \u222a [0, k\u03c4 )\n\nProof: We first show that \u03c6 is well defined. From (39) we know that every I \u2208 A0\u03c4 \u2032 contains\nthe special interval and is thus of the form\nI = [0, i2 ) \u222a [i3 , i4 ) \u222a . . . \u222a [i2u\u22121 , i2u )\n\nwith i2 \u2265 k\u03c4 .\n\nClearly, 0 6\u2208 \u03c6(I). We further distinguish the following two cases:\nCase i2 = k\u03c4 : In this situation \u03c6(I) = [i3 , i4 ) \u222a . . . . Now \u03c6(I) \u2208 \u00c2+\n\u03c4 since by (38) the\ncoefficients of c and c\u2032 and hence the conditions on the ij for j \u2265 3 are the same.\nCase i2 > k\u03c4 : In this situation \u03c6(I) = [k\u03c4 , i2 ) \u222a R with R = [i3 , i4 ) \u222a . . . . We have ck\u03c4 6= 0\nby assumption, and ci2 = c\u2032i2 6= q \u2212 1 as i2 > k\u03c4 . Also all intervals in R are admissible. Hence\n\u03c6(I) \u2208 \u00c2+\n\u03c4 again.\nIn a similar fashion we show that \u03c6\u22121 is well defined using the fact that any L \u2208 \u00c2+\n\u03c4 is\n\u22121\nby (36) of the form L = [j1 , j2 ) \u222a [j3 , j4 ) \u222a . . . with j1 \u2265 k\u03c4 . For j1 > k\u03c4 we have \u03c6 (L) =\n[0, k\u03c4 ) \u222a [j1 , j2 ) \u222a [j3 , j4 ) \u222a . . . . This is \u00c20\u03c4 \u2032 as c\u20320 6= 0, c\u2032k\u03c4 6= p \u2212 1, and c\u2032j = cj for j \u2265 j1 . In\ncase that j1 = k\u03c4 we have \u03c6\u22121 (L) = [0, j2 ) \u222a [j3 , j4 ) \u222a . . . , which is again in \u00c20\u03c4 \u2032 since c\u2032j = cj for\nj \u2265 j2 > j1 . It is obvious that \u03c6 and \u03c6\u22121 are inverses of each other given (36) and (39).\nNext we consider how the differential from (32) changes under this bijection.\nLemma 11 We have\n\n\u2032\n\n\u03c4\n\u03b4I\u03c4 = \u03b4\u03c6(I)\n+ c0\n\nProof: This is a computation done according to the same cases as in the proof of Lemma 10:\nCase i2 = k\u03c4 :\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u03c4\n+\nThen \u03b4I\u03c4 = \u03b4[0,k\n\u03c4)\n\nP\n\n\u03c4\u2032\nj\u22652 \u03b4[i2j\u22121 ,i2j ) .\n\nNow, since c\u2032i = p \u2212 1 for i = 1, . . . , k\u03c4 \u2212 1\n\u2032\n\n\u03c4\n= (p \u2212 1 \u2212 c\u20320 ) + p0 = c0 . We also have \u03b4[i\u03c4 2j\u22121 ,i2j ) = \u03b4[i\u03c4 2j\u22121 ,i2j ) since the ci are all\nwe have \u03b4[0,k\n\u03c4)\nP\n\u03c4\nthe same with ij > k\u03c4 .

Moreover, Lemma 10 and Lemma 11 imply that\n\u2032\n\u03c4\n\u03c4\n+ c0 \u2264 b + c0 iff \u03b4\u03c6(I)\n\u2264 b iff \u03c6(I) \u2208 A+\nI \u2208 A0\u03c4 \u2032 iff \u03b4I\u03c4 \u2264 b\u2032 iff \u03b4\u03c6(I)\n\u03c4 . The fact that \u03c6(A) \u2282 \u03c6(B)\niff A \u2282 B is obvious. Relation (45) is immediate from Lemma 11, (34) and (37).\nLet us turn now to the analogous relations between the modules. The set A0\u03c4 contains a\nminimal element, namely I\u03c40 = [0, h\u03c4 ), which is the smallest interval with h\u03c4 > 0 and ch\u03c4 6= p \u2212 1.\nWe denote the modules\n\u2298\n\nS \u03c4p = M\u03c4\u03bd\n\n0\nI\u03c4\n\n\u03c4\n\u22b2\u22b3\nS \u03c4p = Sp\n\nand\n\n(\u03c4 )\n\n.\n\n\u2298\nS \u03c4p .\n\nBy 3. of Theorem 10 we know that the modules in the composition series of M\u03c4\u03bd\n\u03bd (\u03c4 )\n\nform DpJ\n\n0\nI\u03c4\n\n(\u03c4 )\n\nare of the\n\n, where I\u03c40 \u2286 J, which is equivalent to J \u2208 A0\u03c4 . Hence\n\u2298\n\nF( S \u03c4p ) = {Dp\u03bdI (\u03c4 ) : I \u2208 A0\u03c4 }\n\nand\n\n\u22b2\u22b3\n\nF( S \u03c4p ) = {Dp\u03bdI (\u03c4 ) : I \u2208 A+\n\u03c4 }.\n\n\u2298 \u2032\n\n(46)\n\n\u2032\n\nWith h\u03c4 \u2032 = k\u03c4 and I\u03c40\u2032 = \u03c6(\u2205) we thus have S \u03c4p = M\u03c4\u03c4 . The bijection from Corollary 11\n\u2298 \u2032\n\u22b2\u22b3\nallows us now to show that the composition series of S \u03c4p and S \u03c4p yield exactly the same set of\nirreducibles via the identification\n\u2298 \u2032\n\n\u22b2\u22b3\n\n=\n\n\u03c6\u2217 : F( S \u03c4p ) \u2212\u2192 F( S \u03c4p ) :\n\nDp\u03bdI (\u03c4\n\n\u2032)\n\n=\n\n\u03bd\n\n7\u2192 Dp\u03c6(I)\n\n(\u03c4 )\n\nLemma 12 Let \u03c4 and \u03c4 \u2032 be as above. Suppose there is a non-zero map\n\u03be : Sp\u03c4 \u2212\u2192 Sp\u03c4\nThen we have\n\n\u2298 \u2032\n\nim(\u03be) = S \u03c4p\n\n\u2032\n\nwith\nand\n19\n\n\u2298\n\nS \u03c4p \u2286 ker(\u03be) .\n\u2298\n\nker(\u03be) = S \u03c4p .\n\n.\n\n(47)\n\n\f\u22b2\u22b3\n\n\u2298\n\n\u2032\n\nProof: Consider the map \u03be : S \u03c4p \u2212\u2192 Sp\u03c4 defined on the quotient by S \u03c4p as well as the\n\u22b2\u22b3\n\n\u22b2\u22b3 \u2032\n\ncomposite \u03be : S \u03c4p \u2212\u2192 S \u03c4p with the projection. Now, since by 1. of Theorem 10 we have a\n\u2298 \u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u22b2\u22b3 \u2032\n\n\u22b2\u22b3 \u2032\n\n\u22b2\u22b3\n\ndisjoint union F(Sp\u03c4 ) = F( S \u03c4p ) \u222a F( S \u03c4p ) so that by (47) F( S \u03c4p ) \u2229 F( S \u03c4p ) = \u2205. Hence \u03be is a\nmap between modules with no common\nirreducibles in their composition series so that \u03be = 0.\n\u2298 \u2032\nThus the image of \u03be or \u03be must lie in S \u03c4p . Consider the sequence of maps\n\u03be :\n\n\u03b3\n\n\u22b2\u22b3\n\n\u03be\n\n\u2298 \u2032\n\nM\u03c4\u03c4 = Sp\u03c4 \u2212\u2192 S \u03c4p \u2212\u2192 S \u03c4p = M\u03c4\u03c4\n\n\u2032\n\nSince all multiplicities are one we have again a disjoint union F(M\u03c4\u03c4 ) = F(ker(\u03be)) \u222a F(im(\u03be))\nso that either Dp\u03c4 \u2208 F(ker(\u03be)) or Dp\u03c4 \u2208 F(ker(\u03be)). In the first case this would mean that\nker(\u03be) \u2286 M\u03c4\u03c4 is a submodule that contains Dp\u03c4 in its composition series so that by minimality\nker(\u03be) = M\u03c4\u03c4 . We had, however, assumed that \u03be 6= 0. Hence Dp\u03c4 must be contained in the\n\u2032\n\u2032\ncomposition series of im(\u03be) \u2286 M\u03c4\u03c4 . Again it follows by minimality that im(\u03be) = M\u03c4\u03c4 . This\nalso means that \u03be is a surjective\u2298 map. The fact that all multiplicities are one together with (47)\n\u22b2\u22b3\n\u2032\nimplies that dim( S \u03c4p ) = dim( S \u03c4p ). Hence \u03be must be an isomorphism.\nWe are finally in the position to establish following resolution of irreducible modules by\nSpecht modules.\nTheorem 12 The sequences (26) from Corollary 8 are exact.\n{n+1\u22122l}\n\nProof: We begin by deriving from Theorem 10 that the first term Sp\nin the sequence\nis irreducible. Here we have b = l and c = n + 1 \u2212 2l = 2ph + 2q \u2212 k \u2212 2l so that by (27)\nb=\n\n(\n\nq\u2212k\nq\n\nif q \u2265 k\nif q < k\n\nand\n\nc0 =\n\n(\n\nk\np\u2212k\n\nif q \u2265 k\nif q < k\n\nNow for a set I \u2208 A\u03c4 with I 6= \u2205 we have \u03b4I \u2265 p \u2212 c0 . We also need \u03b4I \u2264 b and hence p \u2212 c0 \u2264 b.\nFor q \u2265 k this condition reduces to p \u2264 q, which is not possible, and for q < k we find q \u2265 k,\n\u22b2\u22b3 {n+1\u22122l}\n{n+1\u22122l}\n{n+1\u22122l}\na contradiction as well. Hence A\u03c4 = {\u2205} so that Sp\n= Sp\n= Dp\nand\n\u2298\n{n+1\u22122l}\nSp\n= 0.\n{(i+1)p+ki+1 }\n{ip+ki }\nNext, we observe that all maps E ki : Sq\n\u2192 Sq\nin the sequence are of the type\nof the ones in Lemma 12 with diagrams related by (37). More precisely, we have c0 = ki+1 so\nthat c\u2032 = c \u2212 2c0 = (i + 1)p + ki+1 \u2212 2ki+1 = jp + (p \u2212 ki+1 ) = ip + ki . Corollary 8 also implies\nthat these maps are non-zero and equivariant. It now follows by induction, going from large to\nsmall i, that\n\u2298\n\nker(E ki ) = S q{(i+1)p+ki+1 }\n\nand\n\n\u2298\n\nim(E ki ) = S q{ip+ki } .\n\nFor the first two maps in the sequence this is clear by irreducibility of the first module and the\nfact that the next map is non-zero.\n\u2298\n{(i+1)p+ki+1 }\nOnce we have proved the relation for E ki+1 we know from E ki E ki+1 = 0 that S q\n=\nim(E ki+1 ) \u2286 ker(E ki ). We can thus apply Lemma 12 to E ki and infer the statement for i from\n{k}\ni + 1. Hence exactness holds for the terms before Sp .\nFor this last Specht module we have c0 = k and cj = 0 for j > 0. Thus A+\n\u03c4 = {\u2205} and\nn\u2212k+1\nn+k+1\nj\n0\nj\n} using that \u03b4[0,j) = p \u2212 k and b =\n. Particularly, we have\nA\u03c4 = {[0, j) : p \u2264\n2\n2\n\u22b2\u22b3 {k}\n\nthat S p\n\n{k}\n\n= Dp\n\n\u2298\n\n{k}\n\nis already irreducible. The kernel of the last map already contains S p , the\n20\n\n\fimage of the previous map, in its kernel. If the kernel was bigger the map would thus have to\n{k}\nbe zero, which is not the case. Hence exactness also holds at Sp . Finally, the last map is by\nirreducibility onto so that exactness holds through out the sequence.\nAs a result we obtain that the sequence of TQFT's in (28) of Corollary 9 is exact and\n==\nthis yields a resolutions of the TQFT's V (k)\np with 0 < k < p, thus proving Theorem 2. The\nkernels and cokernels of these sequences also define TQFT's, which we denote in analogy to the\n\u2298\n\u22b2\u22b3 (j)\n(j)\nsymmetric group representations by V p and V p so that we have short exact sequences\n\u2298\n\n\u22b2\u22b3\n\n0 \u2192 V (j)\n\u2212\u2192 Vp(j) \u2212\u2192 V (j)\n\u2192 0 .\np\np\n\n(48)\n\n6. Characters, Dimensions, and the Alexander Polynomial\nAn obvious application of Theorem 12 is that we can express the characters \u03c6\u03c4pk and dimen{k}\n\n, n\u2212k+1\n] with k \u2261 n + 1 mod 2 and 0 < k < p\nsions of the Dp\u03c4k = Dp for diagrams \u03c4k = [ n+k\u22121\n2\n2\n\u03c4\nin terms of the ordinary characters \u03c7 of Specht modules S \u03c4 .\nCorollary 13 For k \u2261 n+1 mod 2 and 0 < k < p we have the following identity of Sn -characters\n\u03c6\u03c4pk =\n\nX\n\n(\u22121)i \u03c7\u03c4ji ,\n\n(49)\n\ni\u22650\n\nwhere ji = ip + ki and ki = k for i even and ki = p \u2212 k for i odd.\nAs an example we consider the special case p = 5, where k = 1 or 3 if n is even and k = 2 or\n4 if n odd. In [22] Ryba constructs a family of irreducible so called Fibonacci representations\nRn and Rn\u2032 of Sn over F5 with Brauer characters \u03c6n and \u03c6\u2032n respectively. It follows by straight\n[r,r]\nforward computation from (49) and the formulae in Definition 2 of [22] that \u03c6\u2032n = \u03c65 and\n[r+1,r]\n[r+2,r\u22121]\n[r+1,r\u22121]\nif n = 2r + 1 is odd.\nand \u03c6n = \u03c65\nif n = 2r is even, and \u03c6\u2032n = \u03c65\n\u03c6n = \u03c65\nCorollary 14 The Fibonacci representations from [22] are\nRn\n\n\u223c\n=\n\n(\n\n[r+1,r\u22121]\n\nD5\n[r+1,r]\nD5\n\nif n = 2r\nif n = 2r + 1\n\nand\n\nRn\u2032\n\n\u223c\n=\n\n(\n\n[r,r]\n\nD5\n\n[r+2,r\u22121]\n\nD5\n\nif n = 2r\nif n = 2r + 1\n\nWe expect similar relations with the generalizations of these representations obtained by Kleshchev\nin [11].\nThe dimensions\nof the Specht modules are naturally given by the Catalan numbers C(n, j) =\nn\u0001\nn \u0001\n\u2212\n.\nMore\nprecisely,\ndim(S [n\u2212b,b] ) = C(n, b). Particularly, we find for the components of\nj\nj\u22121\nthe sequence in (26) that dim(S {c2s } ) = C(n, b \u2212 sp) and dim(S {c2s+1 } ) = \u2212C(n, b + (s + 1)p),\nwith b = n+1\u2212k\n, where we also use that C(n, j) = \u2212C(n, n + 1 \u2212 j).

First\nxn \u2212 x\u2212n\nwe write [n]x =\n\u2208 Z[x, x\u22121 ] for the usual quantum integers. Moreover we consider now\nx \u2212 x\u22121\nP\nj\nthe ring of cyclotomic integers Z[\u03b6p ] obtained Z[x, x\u22121 ] by imposing the relation p\u22121\nj=0 x = 0.\nIt is free as a Z-module of rank p \u2212 1.

It is not hard to see that the\nset of [k]\u03b6p restricted to either even k or to odd k yields a Z-basis for A[\u03b6p ].\nLemma 13 We have the following identity in A[\u03b6p ]:\n[2]n\u03b6p =\n\nX\n\ndnk [k]\u03b6p\n\n(52)\n\n0<k<p\nk\u2261n+1 mod 2\nn+j\u22121 n\u2212j+1\nL\nProof: We have by Schur Weyl duality that LnZ \u223c\n= V2\u2297n \u223c\n= j\u2261n\u22121 mod 2 Vj \u2297 S [ 2 , 2 ] .\nThe operator xH with H \u2208 sl(2, Z) is well defined and has trace trVj (xH ) = [j]x . It thus\nP\nfollows that [2]nx = l\u22651,l\u2261n+1 mod 2 [l]x C(n, n\u2212l+1\n2 ). Now any such l can be uniquely written in\nthe form l = k + 2sp or l = \u2212k + 2(s + 1)p with s \u2265 0 and k \u2261 n + 1 mod 2 and 0 < k <\np. Specializing to a root of unity x = \u03b6p we have then that [l]\u03b6p = [k]\u03b6p and [l]\u03b6p = \u2212[k]\u03b6p\nn\u2212k+1\nn+k+1\nrespectively. Also C(n, n\u2212l+1\n\u2212 sp) and C(n, n\u2212l+1\n\u2212 (s + 1)p) =\n2 ) = C(n,\n2\n2 ) = C(n,\n2\nn\u2212k+1\n\u2212C(n, 2 +(s+1)p) respectively. Hence, the terms for a fixed k are given by [k]\u03b6p C(n, b\u2212sp)\nand [k]\u03b6p C(n, b + (s + 1)p) for s \u2265 0 and b = n+1\u2212k\n, which with s \u2208 Z adds up to the expression\n2\nin (50).\n\nUsing [2]x [k]x = [k \u2212 1]x + [k + 1]x and the bases of A[\u03b6p ] \u2282 Z[\u03b6p ] we readily derive from (52)\n= dnk\u22121 + dnk+1 . This translates for 0 \u2264 a \u2212 b \u2264 p \u2212 2 to\nthe recursion dn+1\nk\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\n[a,a\u22121]\n\ndim(Dp\n)\n[a\u22121,b]\n[a,b\u22121]\n[a,b]\ndim(Dp ) =\ndim(Dp\n) + dim(Dp\n)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n[a\u22121,b]\n\uf8f3\ndim(Dp\n)\n\nif a = b\nif 0 < a \u2212 b < p \u2212 2\nif a \u2212 b = p \u2212 2\n\n.\n\n(53)\n\nIt is easy to see from this form that the dimensions are indeed given by the number of paths\nthrough the set of diagrams with a \u2212 b \u2264 p \u2212 2 as described in in [14] for general diagrams.\n\u2032\n) and\nIn the case p = 5 this recursion reduces to dim(Rn ) = dim(Rn\u22121 ) + dim(Rn\u22121\n\u2032\ndim(Rn ) = dim(Rn\u22121 ) so that the dimensions are given by Fibonacci numbers. More precisely, we have dim(Rn ) = fn and dim(Rn\u2032 ) = fn\u22121 , where fn are the Fibonacci numbers defined\nby f0 = 0, f1 = 1 and fn+1 = fn + fn\u22121 . Note that together with (50) we find interesting presentations of Fibonacci numbers in terms of alternating, 5-periodic sums of Catalan numbers:\nf2r = C(2r, r \u2212 1) \u2212 C(2r, r \u2212 3) + C(2r, r \u2212 6) \u2212 C(2r, r \u2212 8) + . . .\n\n(54)\n\n= C(2r + 1, r \u2212 1) \u2212 C(2r + 1, r \u2212 2) + C(2r + 1, r \u2212 6) \u2212 C(2r + 1, r \u2212 7) + . . .\nand\nf2r+1 = C(2r + 1, r) \u2212 C(2r + 1, r \u2212 3) + C(2r + 1, r \u2212 5) \u2212 C(2r + 1, r \u2212 8) + . . .\n\n(55)\n\n= C(2r + 2, r + 1) \u2212 C(2r + 2, r \u2212 3) + C(2r + 2, r \u2212 4) \u2212 C(2r + 2, r \u2212 8) + . . .\nThe reader is invited to check these identities independently via recursion relations such as\nC(n + 1, j) = C(n, j) + C(n, j \u2212 1) or via the well known generating functions of Catalan and\nFibonacci numbers.\n22\n\n\fAnother useful tool in the determination of dimensions are fusion algebras or Verlinde algebras, see [1]. For the quantum group Uq (sl2 ) at a p-th root of unity the ring of irreducible\nrepresentations yields the fusion algebra \u03a6p generated by the irreducibles h[1i], h[2i], . . . , h[p \u2212 1i].\nLet us denote by mult(k, R) \u2208 N \u222a {0} the multiplicity of h[ji] in an element R \u2208 \u03a6p so\nP\nthat R = j mult(k, R)h[ki]. We have relations h[1i] \u25e6 h[ki] = h[ki], h[p \u2212 1i] \u25e6 h[ki] = h[p \u2212 ki] and\nh[2i] \u25e6 h[ki] = h[k + 1i] + h[k \u2212 1i] for 1 < k < p \u2212 1. Comparing this to the recursion in (53) we find\nthat\n]\n[ n+k\u22121 , n\u2212k+1\n2\n) = mult(k, h[2i]n )\n(56)\ndim(Dp 2\n==\n\n==\n\n(k)\nNow, as the Dp\u03c4 are isomorphic to the weight spaces W (k)\np (\u03bb, g) with n = n(\u03bb) we find dim( V p (\u03a3g )) =\nn+k\u22121 n\u2212k+1\n\u0001\ng\u2212n g dim(D [ 2 , 2 ] )\np\nn=0 2\nn\n\nPg\n\nso that we find the following Verlinde type formula.\n\nLemma 14\n\n==\n\ng\ndim( V (k)\np (\u03a3g )) = mult(k, ff p )\n\nff p = 2h[1i] + h[2i] \u2208 \u03a6p .\n\nwith\n\n(57)\n\nCompare this to the TQFT's Vp\u2217RT and VpRT of Reshetikhin Turaev for the quantum groups\nUq (sl2 ) and Uq (s03 ) respectively at a p-th root of unity. (VpRT is really a factor TQFT obtained\nP\nfrom Vp\u2217RT by restricting to odd dimensional representations). With FFp = j h[2j + 1i]2 and\nP\nFF\u2217p = 2FFp = k h[ki]2 we have\ndim(Vp\u2217RT (\u03a3g )) = mult(1, FF\u2217p g ) = 2g mult(1, FFgp ) = 2g dim(VpRT (\u03a3g ))\n\n(58)\n\nIn the case p = 5 these formulae allow us to efficiently compute and compare dimensions.\n(k)\n\nLemma 15 We have for the dimensions Dg\n\n==(k\u22121)\n\n= dim( V 5\n\n(\u03a3g )) .\n\n1.

These relations imply \u03c1n = fn\u22121 1 + fn \u03c1, ff 5 = 2 + \u03c3 \u25e6 \u03c1\nand FF5 = 2 + \u03c1. We note now that FF25 = (2 + \u03c1)2 = 4 + 4\u03c1 + \u03c12 = 5(1 + \u03c1) = 5\u03c12 so that\ng\nFFg5 = 5 2 (fg\u22121 + fg \u03c1) if g is even. From there we compute directly that for odd g we have\ng\u22121\nFFgp = 5 2 ((fg\u22122 + fg ) + (fg\u22121 + fg+1 )\u03c1). Consider also \u03b7 = 1 \u2212 \u03c1. We have \u03b7 2 = 1 \u2212 2\u03c1 + \u03c12 =\n2\u2212\u03c1 = 1+\u03b7 and thus again \u03b7 n = fn\u22121 +fn \u03b7. We find (2\u2212\u03c1)g = \u03b7 2g = f2g\u22121 +f2g \u03b7 = f2g+1 \u2212f2g \u03c1.\nNow, we have (1 + \u03c3) \u25e6 ff 5 = (1 + \u03c3) \u25e6 FF5 and thus (1 + \u03c3) \u25e6 ff g5 = (1 + \u03c3) \u25e6 FFg5 . Similarly, we\nfind (1 \u2212 \u03c3) \u25e6 ff g5 = (1 + \u03c3) \u25e6 (2 \u2212 \u03c1)g so that ff g5 = 12 (1 + \u03c3) \u25e6 FFg5 + 12 (1 \u2212 \u03c3) \u25e6 (2 \u2212 \u03c1)g . With the\n23\n\n\fprevious results on FFg5 and (2 \u2212 \u03c1)g we thus find a formula for ff g5 , which inserted into (57) yields\nthe asserted formulae.\n==(1) ==(4)\nThe formula in (59) reflects the fact that V 5 \u2295 V 5 is the sum of the irreducible constituents\nof the F5 -reductions of V5RT as TQFT's, see [10]. For larger primes p it is, however, not possible\n(j)\nthat a Fp -reduction VpRT has only the Vp as irreducible components. This is easily see by looking\nat the large g asymptotics of the dimension expressions in (57) and (58). The operations on\n\u03a6p given by multiplication by FFg or ff g are represented by matrices with non-negative integer\ncoefficents. Perron-Frobenius theory thus implies that the matrix elements of of FFgg or ff gg , such\nas those in (57) and (58), grow like \u223c kff p kg and \u223c kFFp kg , respectively, where kFFp k = 4 sinp2 ( \u03c0 )\np\n\n\u03c0\nand kff p k = 4 cos2 ( 2p\n) are the largest eigenvalues of the associate matrices. We thus obtain (8).\nNote, that kFF5 k = kff 5 k but that kFFp k > kff p k if p > 5. Thus, a linear relation as Theorem 5\ncannot generalize to p > 5. Instead, we can find polynomials Rp (f ) \u2208 Z[f ] of with degree\np\u22123\ndeg(Rp ) =\nsuch that FFp = Rp (ff p ) by using recursive relations in \u03a6p , which may be\n2\nidentified with a F2 -extension of the real part of Z[\u03b6p ]. Using modified Tschebycheff polynomials,\nwhich we define by the recursion Pj+1 (x) + Pj\u22121 = x * Pj (x) , with P0 (x) = 1 and P1 (x) = x,\nthe Rp can be written as follows.\np\u22123\n\nRp (f ) =\n\n2\nX\n\nnj * Pj (f \u2212 2) ,\n\nwith\n\nnj =\n\nj=0\n\n(\n\np\u22121\u2212j\n2\nj+1\n2\n\nfor j even\nfor j odd\n\n.\n\n(60)\n\nFor example, R5 (f ) = f , R7 (f ) = 2f 2 \u2212 7f + 7, R9 (f ) = 2f 3 \u2212 9f 2 + 9f + 3, R11 = 3f 4 \u2212 22f 3 +\n55f 2 \u2212 55f + 22, and R13 (f ) = 3f 5 \u2212 26f 4 + 78f 3 \u2212 91f 2 + 26f + 13. These polynomial appear\nto play an important r\u00f4le in representation theoretic aspects of Conjecture 6.\nThe analogs of the character expansions given in Corollary 13 and relations as in Lemma 13\nin the context of the corresponding TQFT's attain a topological interpretation via the Alexander\nPolynomial \u2206\u03c6 (M ) \u2208 Z[x, x\u22121 ] for a compact, oriented 3-manifold M with a selected epimorphism \u03c6 : H1 (M, Z) \u2192\n\u2192 Z. Up to S-equivalence the cocycle \u03c6 defines a two-sided embedded\nsurface \u03a3 \u2282 M and cobordism C\u03a3 : \u03a3 \u2192 \u03a3 obtained by removing a neighborhood of \u03a3 from M .\nThe Alexander Polynomial is then given (up to a sign, which is determined by the additional\nframing structure on M ) by the following identity extracted in Section 11 of [8]:\n\u2206\u03c6 (M ) = trace(x\u2212H VZ (C\u03a3 )) =\n\nX\n\n(j)\n\n[j]\u2212x trace(VZ (C\u03a3 ))\n\n(61)\n\nj\u22651\n\nBy inserting x = \u03b6p or x = \u2212\u03b6p , a p-th root of unity, and reducing the integer coefficients to Fp\nwe consider the image of the Alexander Polynomial under the two so defined natural maps\nZ[x, x\u22121 ] \u2212\u2192 Fp [\u03b6p ]\n\n:\n\n==\n\nx 7\u2192 \u00b1\u03b6p : \u2206\u03c6 (M ) 7\u2192 \u2206 \u00b1\n\u03c6,p (M ) .\n\n(62)\n\nNow, if we insert x = \u03b6p into (61) and use [ji ]\u00b1\u03b6p = (\u00b11)k\u22121 (\u22121)i [k]\u03b6p , where ji = ip + ki as\nbefore, we infer from the resolutions of TQFT's in (28) the following identities\np\u22121\n\n==+\n\u2206 \u03c6,p (M )\n\n=\n\n2\nX\n\n\u0010\n\nk=1\np\u22121\n\n==\u2212\n\u2206 \u03c6,p (M )\n\n=\n\n2\nX\n\nk=1\n\n==\n\n\u0011\n\n==\n\n(p\u2212k)\n(C\u03a3 )) ,\n(\u22121)k\u22121 [k]\u03b6p trace( V (k)\np (C\u03a3 )) + trace( V p\n\n\u0010\n\n==\n\n==\n\n\u0011\n\n(p\u2212k)\n[k]\u03b6p trace( V (k)\n(C\u03a3 )) .\np (C\u03a3 )) \u2212 trace( V p\n\n24\n\n(63)\n\n(64)\n\n\f==\n\nThis implies Theorem 3.

Johnson-Morita Extensions\nAs before we consider for H = H1 (\u03a3) a standard basis {a1 , . . . , ag , b1 , . . . , bg } that is symplectic with respect to the standard skew form ( , ) and orthonormal with respect to the inner\nform h , i.

Commutators:\n\n[E, \u03bc(x)] = \u03bd(x)\n\nand\n\nH.\n\nProof: Covariance for \u03bd is obvious. For \u03bc consider g\u03bc(x)g\u22121 = (g\u2217\u22121 \u03bd(Jx)g \u2217 )\u2217 = \u03bd(g\u2217\u22121 Jx)\u2217 =\n\u03bd(Jgx)\u2217 = \u03bc(gx). Also homomorphy is obvious and the fact that \u03bd(\u03c9) = E follows by definition. This implies the zero-commutators since \u03c9 is even, hence central, and F = E \u2217 . The\nanticommutator relation is readily translated to \u03bd(x)\u2217 \u03bd(y) + \u03bd(y)\u03bd(x)\u2217 = hx, yiI. As a symmetric bilinear Vrelation Vit suffices\nV\u2217 to prove this for a system of two orthonormal vectors v\n\u2217\n\u2217\nand w. Then H =\nL \u2297 L\u22a5 , where L is the space spannedVby v and w and L\u22a5 its\n\u2217\nL \u223c\northogonal complement. Clearly, \u03bd(v) and \u03bd(w) act only on the\n= (Z2 )\u22972 with basis\n{1, v, w, v \u2227 w} = {e\u2212 \u2297 e\u2212 , e+ \u2297 e\u2212 , e\u2212 \u2297 e+ , e+ \u2297 e+ } . In this form the operators take\non the form \u03bd(v) = E \u2297 I and \u03bd(w) = \u2212H \u2297 E, where the sl2 -generators E and H act as\nusual.

By the homomorphism\nproperty it suffices to show the second relation for m = 1. In this case \u03bc(x)E l+1 z = E l+1 \u03bc(x)z +\n(l + 1)E l \u03bd(x)z \u2208 im(E l ) by iteration of the commutator relation.\nConsider now the following family of extensions of the symplectic group defined as a semidirect product.\nVm\n\u0011\n\u00101\nH\nVm\u22122\n\u22ca Sp(2g, Z)\n(66)\nJMa (m, g) =\na \u03c9\u2227\nH\nProposition 15 For a 6\u2261 0 mod p we have well defined representations of JMa (m, g) on\n\u03bc\n\nUp(j) (m, g) = Vp(j) (\u03a3g ) \u2295 Vp(j+m) (\u03a3g )\nwhich decomposes as indicated if restricted to Sp(2g, Z) and is given by \u03bc if restricted to the\nabelian part. For j \u2261 k mod p with 0 < k < p \u2212 m and using the notation from (48) we have\n\u2298\n\n(j)\n\nthat U p (m, g) =\n\n\u2298\n\n\u03bc\n\n(j)\n\n\u2298\n\n(j+m)\n\nV p (\u03a3g ) \u2295 V p\n\n(\u03a3g ) is a proper submodule with subquotient\n(j)\n\n\u03bc\n\n\u22b2\u22b3\n\n.\n\n\u22b2\u22b3\n\u22b2\u22b3\n\u2298\n(j+m)\nV (j)\n(\u03a3g ) \u223c\n.\n= Up (m, g) U (j)\np (\u03a3g ) \u2295 V p\np (m, g)\n\nU (j)\np (m, g) =\n\n(67)\n\nProof: In general if V , W and M are G-modules, and \u03bc : M \u2192 Hom(V, W ) a covariant map,\n\u03bc\n\nwe construct\na module\nV \u2295 W of M \u22ca G by letting (m, g) act on the sum V \u2295 W by the block\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u03bc\ng\n0\nmatrix\nso that W \u2282 V \u2295 W is a submodule with subquotient V . Thus the map \u03bc\n\u03bc(m)g g\nfrom Lemma 17 defines such a module for JM1 (m, g) over Z. In the Fp -reduction a is invertible\nso that \u03bc can be extended to JMa (m, g).\n\u2298\n(j)\n(j)\nBy exactness of the sequences in (28) we have that V p (\u03a3g ) = Vp (\u03a3g ) \u2229 im(E p\u2212k ). Thus\n\u2298\n\u2298\n(j)\n(j+m)\n(j+m)\nby (65) of Lemma 17 we have that \u03bc(x)( V p (\u03a3g )) \u2286 Vp\n(\u03a3g ) \u2229 im(E p\u2212k\u2212m ) = V p\n(\u03a3g ).\n\u2298\n\u2298\n(j)\n(j+m)\nThis implies, by construction, that V p (\u03a3g )\u2295 V p\n(\u03a3g ) is indeed a submodule.\nNote that for 0 < k < p the factors in (67) are irreducible. We also write\n==(j)\nU p (m, g)\n\n\u03bc ==\n\n==\n\n(j+m)\n= V (j)\n(\u03a3g ) .\np (\u03a3g ) \u2295 V p\n\n(68)\n\nThe case that is topologically relevant is m = 3. For this case Morita constructed in [16] a\nhomomorphism k\u0303 : \u0393g \u2192 JM2 (3, g) on the mapping class group \u0393g . Its kernel is the group Kg\ngenerated by bounding cycles\nV and its restriction to the Torelli group coincides with the Johnson\n3\n\nhomomorphism \u03c42 : Ig \u2192\n\nH\nH\n\nfrom [6].\n\nTheorem 16 (Johnson[6], Morita [16]) There is a finite index subgroup Qg \u2282 JM2 (3, g) =\n1\n2\n\nV3\n\nH\nH\n\n\u22ca Sp(2g, Z), and homomorphisms \u03c42 and k\u0303 such that the following diagram is commutative\n\n26\n\n\fwith all rows and the last column exact.\n0\n\n0\n\n> Kg >\n\n0\n\n> Kg >\n\u2228\n\u2228\n> Ig >\n\n0\n\nw\nw\nw\nw\nw\n\n> Ig\n\u2228\n\u2228\n> \u0393g\n\n\u03c42\n\nk\u0303\n\nw\nw\nw\nw\nw\n\n\u2228\nH\n\u226b\n\u03c9\u2227H\n\u2228\n\u2228\n\u226b Qg\nV3\n\n\u2228\n\u2228\n\u226b Sp(2g, Z)\n\n> \u0393g\n\n>0\n\n>0\n\n>0\n\n\u2228\n0\nCombining this result with Proposition 15 now yields Theorem 4, where we denoted the special\n==\n==(j)\nmodule U (j)\np (\u03a3g ) = U p (3, g). Note, that we obtain from the sequences in (28) similar resolutions. Particularly, for g \u2265 0, p \u2265 5 a prime and 0 < k < p \u2212 3 there is an exact sequence of\nmaps of Fp -modules as follows.\n. . . \u2212\u2192\n\nUp((i+1)p+ki+1 ) (\u03a3g ) \u2212\u2192 Up(ip+ki ) (\u03a3g ) \u2212\u2192 . . . \u2212\u2192 Up(2p+k) (\u03a3g ) \u2212\u2192\n==\n\n\u2212\u2192 Up(2p\u2212k\u22123) (\u03a3g ) \u2212\u2192 Up(k) (\u03a3g ) \u2212\u2192 U (k)\np (\u03a3g ) \u2212\u2192 0 ,\n\n(69)\n\nwhere now ki = k for i is even, and ki = p \u2212 i \u2212 3 if i is odd.\nThe maps are alternatingly given by E k \u2295 E k+3 and E p\u2212k \u2295 E p\u2212k\u22123 . Note, however, that\nthe module extensions work alternatingly in opposite ways so that the maps cannot be Qg equivariant. It is true that by setting R\u0303(g) = R(J\u02c6g\u22121 J\u02c6\u22121 )\u2217 , where J\u02c6 \u2208 \u0393g is a representative of\nthe J \u2208 Sp(2g, Z) above we can reverse the exact sequences that define an extension. Yet, even\nby flipping every second extension in (69) still does not yield equivariant maps.\n\n27\n\n\fBibliography\n[1] Fr\u00f6hlich, J., Kerler, T.: Quantum groups, quantum categories and quantum field theory.\nLecture Notes in Mathematics 1542 Springer-Verlag, Berlin, 1993.\n[2] Frohman, C., Nicas, A.: The Alexander Polynomial via topological quantum field theory,\nDifferential Geometry, Global Analysis, and Topology, Canadian Math.
