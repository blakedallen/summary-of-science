The essential hypotheses are: (1) spherical symmetry; (2) quasipermanent regime; (3) isotropy of the velocities at all\npoints; (4) mass equality.\nChapter II: We establish the system of fundamentals equations (2.25). The cluster model is reduced to\na canonic form by a homology transformation with timedependent parameters. We will look for a model of invariable canonic form, that is a model which remains similar\nto itself while evolving.\nChapter III: We show that the galactic field imposes\nthe relation (3.8): the cluster's radius is proportional to\nthe cube root of its mass.\nChapter IV: Preliminary calculations show that the\ndensity must be infinite at the center of the cluster. We\nobtain the asymptotic expression (4.14) for the distribution function near the center. The conservation of mass\nimposes condition (4.32). The existence of an energy flux\ntoward the cluster center is predicted.\nChapter V: The ensemble of equations and conditions\nobtained in the preceding chapters forms a system which\n\nis resolved numerically by means of an electronic calculator. We find a unique solution: the \"homology model\"\n[T.N.: homologous model] (Table 1, Figures 4, 5, 6, 15,\n16). Its mass and radius are finite. The outer radius is\napproximately 10 times the mean radius. The mass decreases linearly as a function of time. About one-third\nof the negative energy of the cluster is carried off by the\nstars which escape; the other two-thirds accumulate in\nthe center, in multiple stars.\nChapter VI: We introduce a small number of stars of\ndifferent mass in the homology model and we calculate\ntheir distribution (Figures 8 and 9) and their escape rate\n(Figure 10). We find that as their mass increases, they\nare more concentrated, and escape less rapidly. In particular, if their mass is greater than 3/2 the mass of the\nnormal stars, they are nearly all collected near the center\nof the cluster, and their escape rate is zero.\nChapter VII: We show that should the initial central\ndensity of a cluster be finite, it will grow and become infinite within a finite time (Figure 12). We study next the\nevolution of a cluster differing slightly from the homology\nmodel: we find that the differences decreases, whatever\ntheir form. Thus the homology model is very probably\nthe final state toward which the clusters tend.\n\n\f2\n\nM. H\u00e9non, translated by F. Renaud\n\nChapter VIII: The theoretical results are compared\nwith the observational data on globular clusters. First\nwe construct an \"artificial cluster\" (Figures 15 and 16)\nwhich permits a general comparison. Then we compare\nthe projected densities in detail, Sandage's star counts\nfor the cluster M3, and the brightness measurements for\n47 Tuc by Gascoigne & Burr. The agreement is very satisfying (Figures 18, 19, 21). For the stars of M3, we find a\ndefinite mass-luminosity relation, which however is in disagreement with the relation indicated by stellar evolution\ntheory (Figure 20). The observed masses and radii are in\ngood agreement with the theoretical relation (Figure 22).\nThe outer radii of the clusters are about twice as large\nas the observed radii. The absolute escape rate is constant and equals: 2.3 \u00d7 10\u22126 M\u2299 / yr. This constancy is\nconfirmed by the observed distribution of globular cluster\nmasses (Figure 23). We obtain the initial mass distribution. Observation shows that \u03c9 Cen is the only globular\ncluster whose central density is not yet infinite. From this\nwe deduce that the age of the globular clusters must lie\nbetween 24 \u00d7 109 yr and 44 \u00d7 109 yr, in good agreemen\n[sic] with the age deduced from stellar evolution.\nChapter IX: We list a number of directions in which\ndevelopment of research is to be hoped for.\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nThe problem of the dynamical evolution of a globular cluster can be stated very simply. The only important force\nis the mutual attraction between the stars of the cluster;\nthe other forces (like radiative pressure, electromagnetic\nforces, relativistic effects, etc.) are negligible. Therefore, the topic is the classical n-body problem: finding\nthe motion of n points of given masses, mutually attracting themselves as the inverse square of their distance.\nThis exposition, whereas simple, relates to an extremely arduous mathematical problem. Despite a large\nnumber of studies, it has not been possible to find an explicit solution, which very likely does not exist. Hence,\none can think of the numerical integration. This way,\nvon Hoerner (1960) computed the evolution of artificial\nclusters comprising up to 16 stars, thanks to an electronic\ndevice. But high values of n are out of reach with such a\nmethod, as the computational time becomes rapidly extreme, even for a machine; the case of n = 16 already\ncorresponds to a system of 96 simultaneous differential\nequations.\nIn the globular clusters, n is of the order of magnitude\nof 105\u22126 . Such a high value naturally suggests to give up\nfollowing the individual motions, and to use a statistical\nmethod. The structure of the cluster is then defined at all\ntimes thanks to a distribution function in a 7-dimensional\nspace: 3 position coordinates, 3 velocity coordinates, and\nthe mass. One can write a system of equations that allows, in principle, to calculate the evolution of this function, given its initial form. Unfortunately, the numerical\nresolution seems absolutely out of reach with this general form: indeed, one faces an integro-differential system\n\nwith 8 independent variables!\nThus, it is necessary to make simplifications, or additional hypotheses. Two of them are classical and well\nvalid:\n(H1) we assume that the cluster is spherically symmetric;\n(H2) we assume that the cluster has reached the steady\nstate;\nThe number of independent variables is then reduced from\n8 to 4 (see Equation 2.2 below); but the equations are still\ntoo involved. Therefore, one must make new simplifications, much more arbitrary, that are often only justified\nby their practical utility. The main one consists in considering the structure and the evolution problems separately.\nThis is how a series of studies (e.g. Plummer 1911, 1915;\nEddington 1916; Jeans 1916; Chandrasekhar 1942 Section 5.8, Camm 1952; Woolley & Robertson 1956; H\u00e9non\n1959) has focussed on the structure of the clusters, without considering the evolution. In this case, the distribution function can take any form; it is set by an additional, arbitrary hypothesis, changing from one author to\nthe other. The models obtained this way represent well\nthe observed clusters; however this agreement does not\nmean much, because one of the fundamental equation of\nthe problem as been suppressed, and replaced by an ad\nhoc hypothesis.\nOther works have, on the contrary, studied the evolution by assuming a known structure for the cluster\n(among others, see Spitzer 1940; Chandrasekhar 1943b,c;\nKing 1958a,b,c; Spitzer & Harm 1958; von Hoerner 1958;\nAgekian 1959; H\u00e9non 1960; King 1960; Michie 1961). In\nmost of the cases, it is assumed that the cluster is homogeneous and that the gravitational potential is uniform;\nthe advantage of this is to get rid completely of the space\nvariables. However, the results obtained (the major one\nbeing the escape rate of the stars from the cluster) often\ndisagree from one author to the next (see Figure 10), as\na consequence of the arbitrary hypothesis, that has been\nintroduced here again.\nIn fact, the two aspects, structure and evolution, cannot be told apart; they are intimately related. Equations\nshow this clearly (see Equation 2.22 below). First solving the problem of the structure of the cluster, and then\nfinding out its evolution, or the other way round, is not\npossible. All the equations have to be treated and solved\nas a whole.\nWe hope that the present work constitutes a first step\ntoward this. The homologous model presented in Chapter V is obtained by solving simultaneously the equations\nof structure and evolution. However, this model is far\nfrom being a satisfactory solution to the problem. Indeed,\nit has been necessary to keep two arbitrary hypotheses,\nto avoid a too high complexity in the calculations:\n(H3) we assume that the distribution function only depends on the total energy (this is equivalent to assuming\nthat the velocity distribution is everywhere isotropic);\n(H4) we assume that all the stars have the same mass.\nIt is difficult to known how these simplifications affect\nthe correctness of the results. Therefore, the conclusions\n\n\fOn the dynamical evolution of globular clusters\nshould be taken carefully, and considered as illustrations\ninstead of definitive statements. In fact, the main goal\nof this work is not to immediately obtain useful informations, but rather to set a more rigorous theory by getting\nrid of one of the arbitrary postulates it used to have,\nand by pointing at those that remain to be narrowed (see\nChapter IX).\nOne can ask whether it would be possible to make\nprogress thanks to direct observations, and thus to circumvent or at least diminish, the difficulties of the theoretical work. Unfortunately, it seems that such a method\nis not very successful. Observing globular clusters is difficult, because of a number of reasons: the stellar density\nvaries a lot from the center to the outskirts, so that it is\nimpossible to get a satisfactory image of all the parts of\nthe cluster on a single plate; one only observes the projected density and not the spatial density; measurements\nof individual proper motions are impossible to make; measurements of radial velocities are very imprecise, because\nof large distances. Worst, one observes only the brightest\nstars of the cluster; these stars only contribute to a small\nfraction of the total mass. In other words, the essential\nstructure of the cluster remains invisible.\nObservations of globular clusters bring too little information if one is to derive the theoretical model, characterized by a multi-variable function. This point can be\nillustrated thanks to the following quotes about the comparison between theoretical models and observed clusters: [T.N.: in english in the original version] \"the law\n... represents the structure of a globular cluster with\nclose approach to accuracy everywhere, with the exception of the region immediately surrounding the center\"\n(Plummer 1911); \"this model appears to fit the variations\nof brightness of the observed disk\" (Camm 1952); \"calculations with this model give projected densities which\nagree much better with observations than do those of\nthe simple isothermal case\" (Woolley & Robertson 1956);\n\"with the first models we can obtain a rather fair fit\"\n(von Hoerner 1957); \"l'amas isochrone ... ressemble d'une\nmani\u00e8re surprenante aux amas r\u00e9els\" [T.N.: the isochrone\ncluster ... looks surprisingly similar to the real clusters]\n(H\u00e9non 1959). But each time, the model is different...\nThus, we can say that the agreement with observations is a necessary, but not sufficient condition for the\nvalidity of a theory on the dynamics of the clusters. Observations can be a final test for the theory, but not a\nstarting point.\nHowever, the theory can precisely progress in a purely\ndeductive way, only owing to its own strengths. As we\nhave seen, the physical problem can be translated into a\nsystem of equations describing it, if not perfectly rigorously, at least with a very good precision. This system\nencloses all the information required to solve the problem. That is, we feel that efforts should be made in this\ndirection. Obviously difficulties exist; but they are only\ntechnical, mathematical difficulties, not conceptual ones.\nThanks to the powerful computing machines nowadays, it\ndoes not seem impossible to solve the problem anymore.\n\n2\n\n3\n\nEQUATIONS\n\n2.1\n\nDefinitions and hypotheses\n\nLet\n\u03c6(x, y, z, vx , vy , vz , m, t) dx dy dz dvx dvy dvz dm\n\n(2.1)\n\nbe, at time t, the number of stars of mass between m and\nm+dm and whose the six spacial and velocity coordinates\nlie between x and x+dx ... vz and vz +dvz . As we will see,\nthis distribution function \u03c6 fully describes the structure\nof the cluster.\nWe assume that the cluster is spherically symmetric and that it has reached a steady state or, strictly\nspeaking, a quasi-steady state because evolution makes\nit change slowly (see Spitzer 1940; Kuzmin 1957). One\ncan show (Jeans 1915; Kurth 1955) that the distribution\nfunction depends on the position and velocity coordinates\nonly through two invariants (or strictly speaking, quasiinvariant):\nA, the angular momentum of the star;\nE, the total energy of the star, per unit mass (we will\nrefer to this quantity as total energy, for conciseness).\nTherefore, we have:\n\u03c6(x, y, z, vx , vy , vz , m, t) = f (E, A, m, t).\n\n(2.2)\n\nE is given by the fundamental relation:\nE=U+\n\nv2\n,\n2\n\n(2.3)\n\nwhere U is the gravitational potential, and v is the velocity of the star.\nHere comes our first arbitrary hypothesis. We assume,\nfor the rest of the paper, that f does not depend on the\nangular momentum A. This is equivalent to assuming\nthat the velocity distribution is isotropic (i.e. spherically\nsymmetric) everywhere in the cluster, as shown in (2.3).\nThus, the distribution function shrinks to:\nf (E, m, t).\n\n(2.4)\n\nThanks to this hypothesis, one can have the following\nreasoning. The mutual perturbations of the stars tend to\nestablish a Maxwellian, therefore isotropic, velocity distribution everywhere. The escape phenomenon goes, as\nwe know, against such a distribution: every star rising\nabove a certain critical velocity leaves the cluster (see\nChapter III). But this limitation only concern the modulus of the velocity and not its orientation; in other words,\nit is itself spherically symmetric. We can therefore assume that the Maxwellian equilibrium, which is impossible to establish in term of the distribution of the velocity\nmoduli, does occur in term of the distribution of the orientations, i.e. the velocity distribution becomes isotropic\neverywhere, after a sufficient time.\nBut this reasoning is ambiguous: the stars travel\nacross the entire cluster, and thus, it is forbidden to consider the evolution of a small region in isolation. There-\n\n\f4\n\nM. H\u00e9non, translated by F. Renaud\n\nfore, the validity of our hypothesis is not ensured1 . We\nwill examine the perspectives about this point in Chapter IX.\n2.2\n\nEquations of structure\n\nThese equations are well-known. The density at a given\npoint comes from the distribution function through:\nZ Z Z Z\n\u03c1=\nm\u03c6 dvx dvy dvz dm,\n(2.5)\nor, using the isotropy of the velocities and (2.3):\nZ \u221e\nZ \u221e\n1/2\n\u03c1 = 4\u03c0\nm dm\n(2E \u2212 2U ) f dE.\n0\n\n(2.6)\n\nU\n\nFurthermore, \u03c1, U and the distance to the center r are\nlinked through Poisson's equation:\n\u22022U\n2 \u2202U\n+\n= 4\u03c0G\u03c1.\n\u2202r2\nr \u2202r\n\n(2.7)\n\nWe note that U depends on both r and the time t because\nof the evolution of the cluster: U = U (r, t). In the same\nway: \u03c1 = \u03c1(r, t). The equations (2.6) and (2.7) give \u03c1 and\nU , i.e. the structure of the cluster, once the distribution\nfunction f is known. It remains to write an essential\nequation: the one ruling the variation of f with time.\n2.3\n\nLocal evolution equations\n\nIf the potential of the cluster was perfectly regular, every\nstar would keep its total energy forever and no evolution\nwould occur. In reality however, the potential is created\nby a discrete distribution of masses and yields irregular\nfeatures, that are random and change with time. As a\nconsequence, the total energy of the star experiences perturbations. This question has often been addressed (see\ne.g. Chandrasekhar 1942, Section 2.1); one showed that\nthe star mostly experiences many small perturbations,\nwhose cumulative effect leads to a slow, quasi-continuous,\nvariation of the total energy of the star.\nThis total effect is proportional to ln (l/l1 ), where l is\nthe maximum distance to the perturber stars, and l1 is\nthe \"impact parameter\", i.e. the distance by which two\nstars have to be separated to be deviated by an angle\nof 90\u25e6 . That is, even the very distant stars have a nonnegligible effect. However, l1 is very small: one can show\nthat:\nre\n(2.8)\nl1 \u2243 ,\nn\nwhere re is the radius of the cluster. (Recall that n is the\ntotal number of stars.) Consequently, the majority of the\nperturbations are caused by relatively close stars: e.g., if\nthe cluster counts 105 stars, l1 equals re \u00d7 10\u22125 , and 80%\nof the perturbations would come from stars closer than\nre \u00d7 10\u22121 . Therefore, in order to calculate the perturbations at a given point in the cluster, we will admit that\n\nthe distribution of the velocities is the same in this point\nas everywhere else. This approximation probably leads\nto an error of about 10%, which is acceptable given the\ncurrent state of the theory.\nThe distribution function depends on r and v, through\nE; to emphasize this, we set:\n\u0012\n\u0013\nv2\nf (E, m, t) = f U + , m, t = a(r, v, m, t).\n(2.9)\n2\nIn this entire Section, we will study what happens\nat a given point in the cluster, at the distance r from\nthe center. The function a defined in (2.9) describes the\nvelocity distribution at this point.\nRosenbluth, MacDonald & Judd (1957) gave the\nequation of evolution of such a distribution, with the effects of perturbations, in the very general case where there\nis no symmetry for the velocities, as well as in the case\nof axisymmetry. In our case of spherical symmetry for\nthe velocities, their equation becomes (after some calculations)2 :\n\u0012 \u0013\nZ \u221e\n\u2202a\n= 16\u03c0 2 G2 ln (n)\nm1 dm1 (2.10)\n\u2202t p\n0\n\u0014\nZ v\n1 \u2202\nma\na1 v12 dv1\nv 2 \u2202v\n\u0012 0Z\nm1 \u2202a 1 v\n+\na1 v14 dv1\n3 \u2202v v 0\n\u0013\u0015\nZ \u221e\n+v 2\na1 v1 dv1\nv\n\nwhere, for simplicity, we set a(r, v1 , m1 , t) = a1 . The\nmaximum distance l to the perturber stars has been taken\nequal to the radius of the cluster. The subscript p reminds\nus that the variation of a is due to perturbations.\n2.4\n\nGlobal evolution equations\n\nIt is now time to focus on the entire cluster. Let's consider\nthe subset of stars of given mass m and energy E, at time\nt. These stars are situated at different locations in the\ncluster; but, according to our hypotheses, they all corresponds to the same value of f , thus of a. And yet, after\na very short time, the functional form of a has changed.\nThis modification, given by (2.10), is different from one\nposition in the cluster to another, in general. As a consequence, a does not take the same value over the entire\nsubset of stars anymore. In other words, the perturbations instantaneously destroy the steady-state regime.\nHowever, the steady-state re-appears almost immediately, because of the rapid circulation of the stars within\nthe cluster; the perturbations become equal for all the\nstars of the subset, so that a takes the same value for all\nof them, once again.\nThus, the actual variation of a, after the equalization,\nis obtained when computing the derivative of (2.9), i.e.:\n\u2202f \u2202U\n\u2202f\n\u2202a\n=\n+\n,\n\u2202t\n\u2202E \u2202t\n\u2202t\n\n1 Michie\n\n(1961) highlights an increase of the anisotropy in the\nexternal regions, for a particular model.\n\n2 This\n\n(2.11)\n\nequation has recently been cited and used by King (1960).\n\n\fOn the dynamical evolution of globular clusters\nand we write that \u2202a/\u2202t, given in (2.11), is equal in average to (\u2202a/\u2202t)p , given in (2.10).\nLet g(E, m, t) dE dm be the total number of stars in\nthe subset. One has:\nZ rm\n4\u03c0r2 dr * 4\u03c0av 2 dv dm, (2.12)\ng(E, m, t) dE dm =\n0\n\nwhere the integral is with respect dr. The maximum value\nrm taken by r for a given energy E, is set by:\nU (rm , t) = E,\n\n(2.13)\n\nand the velocity v is given in (2.3), i.e.:\n1/2\n\nv = (2E \u2212 2U )\n\n.\n\nEquation (2.12) becomes:\nZ rm\nr2 dr * av,\ng = 16\u03c0 2\n\n(2.14)\n\n(2.15)\n\n0\n\nand the number of stars in the subset changes as:\n\u0012 \u0013 \u0015\n\u0014\nZ rm\n\u2202g\n\u2202a \u2202(av) \u2202v\n2\n2\n.

Then, we switch the order of the integrations\nover r, m1 and E1 , by recalling that f and f1 do not\ndepend on r. Furthermore, we set:\nZ\n1 rm\n(2E \u2212 2U )3/2 r2 dr = q(E, t),\n(2.19)\n3 0\n3 This equation has already been presented, in a slightly different\nform however, by Kuzmin (1957, Equation 2.5).\n\n5\n\n([T.N.: The upper limit of the integral is missing in the\noriginal version]) and thus,\nZ rm\n\u2202q\n(2E \u2212 2U )1/2 r2 dr,\n(2.20)\n=\n\u2202E\n0\nZ rm\n\u2202q\n1/2 \u2202U 2\n(2E \u2212 2U )\n= \u2212\nr dr.

But before actually solving this system, we first have\nto modify it.\n2.5\n\nEqual masses\n\nIn the rest of this paper (except in Chapter VI), we limit\nourselves to the study of the case where all the stars have\nthe same mass. This is our second arbitrary hypothesis,\nless critical than the first one however. Indeed, whereas\nit is obvious that the masses of the stars are different in\nreal clusters, one can imagine a fictitious cluster where\nall masses would be equal. In other words, the system\nwe study corresponds to a physically plausible situation,\nwhile being simpler than the real systems.\nTherefore, the distribution function reads:\nf (E, m, t) = \u03b4(m \u2212 m1 ) * F (E, t),\n\n(2.23)\n\nwhere m1 is the mass of each star, and \u03b4 is the Dirac's\ndistribution [T.N.: Dirac delta function]. Performing the\nintegrations over m in (2.6) and (2.22) is immediate.\n2.6\n\nNormalized variables\n\nIn order to get rid of the numerical constants, we define\n\"normalized variables\":\n\u03c1\n\n=\n\n4\u03c0m1 D,\n\nr\nq\n\n=\n=\n\n(16\u03c0 2 G m1 )\u22121/2 R,\n(16\u03c0 2 G m1 )\u22123/2 Q,\n\ndt\n\n=\n\n[16\u03c0 2 G2 m21 ln (n)]\u22121 dT.\n\n(2.24)\n\n\f6\n\nM.

Therefore, the two parameters of the homology will be functions of time. This\nhas the great advantage to allow us to split two aspects\nof the evolution of the model: (1) the evolution of the\nsize, represented by the variation of the parameters of\nthe homology; (2) the evolution of the structure itself, dimensionless, represented by the variation of the canonical\nform.\nTherefore, we set:\nE=\u03b2 E\nF = \u03b3 F,\n\nIn addition, we set\nF (\u22121) = \u2212\nS=F\n\n(\u22121)\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nF1 dE1 .\n\n(2.26)\n\nE\n\nE\n\nF1 Q\u20321\n\ndE1 \u2212 F\n\nZ\n\nE\n\n(\u22121)\n\nF1\n\nQ\u20321 dE1 .

This can be easily checked with the equations: at a given time T0 , the\ncluster is completely defined by the distribution function\nF (E, T0 ). The most general homologous transformation\nwould be to multiply F on the one hand, and E on the\nother, with two arbitrary constants. (We assume that\nthe masses of the stars are set; thus, it is not possible to\nchange them through a homology.)\nIt is interesting to use this possibility of homology\nto set any cluster model to a canonical form defined by\ntwo chosen conditions. This allows one to highlight the\nvery structure of the model, in a way that is independent of its size. The two conditions could be, for example: masses and radius equal to defined values. However,\n\n(2.32)\n\nOne can easily check that the first three equations of\nthe system (2.25) remain the same with the new variables.\nThe fourth one changes however, because of derivatives\nwith respect to time.

The choice of the function describing the initial state of the cluster is, therefore,\nquite arbitrary.\nConsequently, it seems more rational to face the problem from the other side, and to first look for what the final\nevolution of the cluster will be. An analogy with gases\nsuggests indeed that the stellar systems should tend toward a defined final state, independent of their initial\nstate; and the similarity of the globular clusters as we\nobserve them today (von Hoerner 1957) seems to confirm\nthis assumption. This final state should be deduced from\nthe system of equations (2.37) alone; it is the equivalent,\nin a way, to the Maxwellian distribution of velocities for\na gas in equilibrium.\nHowever, it is well-known that the final state of a cluster cannot be equilibrium. The stars which gain enough\nenergy through perturbations escape forever from the\ncluster, whose total mass therefore decreases. Hence, a\nstationary state stricto sensu, does not exist.\nHow then, can we imagine the final evolution of the\ncluster? It is time to go back to the distinction made\nabove between the evolution of the size and the evolution\nof the structure. The escape of stars only implies the\nevolution of the size; it does not forbid the existence of a\nmodel for which only the dimensions would vary, while its\nstructure would remain the same; in other words, a model\nwhere the evolution would only consist in \"expansions\" or\n\"contractions\" of the physical quantities. We call such a\nprocess homologous evolution.\nTherefore, it seems natural to seek whether the final\nevolution of the cluster would be of this kind. This is\nwhat we will do in the next Chapters. The answer will be\nyes: we will see first (Chapters III to V) that the system\n(2.37) allows one and only one solution in homologous\nevolution, which we will name homologous model ; second\nwe will show (Chapter VII) that this model represents\nindeed the final state toward which all the clusters tend.\nWriting of the above in mathematical terms is very\nsimple. A model in homologous evolution allows an invariant canonical form: F, Q, and so on, are independent\nof the time. Thus, in particular:\n\u2202Q\n= 0,\n\u2202T\n\n\u2202F\n= 0,\n\u2202T\n\n(2.52)\n\nand the last equation of the system (2.37) shrinks to\n0 = S\u2032\u2032 +\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n3\n3\nb \u2212 c QF\u2032 \u2212 cFQ\u2032 .\n4\n2\n\n(2.53)\n\nThis way, the system becomes independent of time.\n\nBefore focussing on the numerical solution, we still\nhave to examine the boundary conditions. This will be\nthe topic of the next two Chapters.\n3\n3.1\n\nBOUNDARY CONDITIONS\nEffect of the galactic field\n\nGlobular clusters are not isolated systems: they are subject to the gravitational field of the galaxy, an effect that\ncannot be neglected.\nLet UG be the galactic potential. The dimensions of a\ncluster being much smaller than those of the galaxy, this\npotential can be described with sufficient precision by a\nTaylor series truncated to the second order; in a reference\nframe centered on the cluster, moving with it, and with\nthe right orientation, the series reads\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 \u2202 2 UG 2 \u2202 2 UG 2 \u2202 2 UG 2\nUG = UG (0) +\nx +\ny +\nz .\n2\n\u2202x2\n\u2202y 2\n\u2202z 2\n(3.1)\nFurthermore, we almost have:\n\u2202 2 UG\n\u2202 2 UG\n\u2202 2 UG\n+\n+\n= 0,\n\u2202x2\n\u2202y 2\n\u2202z 2\n\n(3.2)\n\nbecause the density of the galaxy is very small in the\nregions where the globular clusters are found. As a consequence, at least one of these three main curvatures is\nnegative. We assume that the one along x is the most\nnegative.\nThe potential created by the cluster is, in the external\nregions:\nGMe\nUA = \u2212\n,\n(3.3)\nr\n[T.N.: the subscript A stands for amas: cluster.], where\nMe is the total mass of the cluster. Thus, the total potential along the x-axis is (Figure 1):\nU = UG + UA = UG (0) +\n\n1 \u2202 2 UG 2 GMe\nx \u2212\n.\n2 \u2202x2\nx\n\n(3.4)\n\nIt reaches a maximum for\n\u0013\u22121/3\n\u0012 2\n\u2202 UG\n,\n\u2212\nxe = (G Me )\n\u2202x2\n\u00131/3\n\u0012 2\n\u2202 UG\n3\n.\nUe = UG (0) \u2212 (G Me )2/3 \u2212\n2\n\u2202x2\n1/3\n\n(3.5)\n\nIt follows that every star that goes beyond this point\nescapes from the cluster forever. This implies that the\nstars that have a radial, oscillatory, trajectory along the\nx-axis cannot have a total energy greater than Ue ; therefore, for these stars:\nf =0\n\nfor E \u2265 Ue .\n\n(3.6)\n\nBut, as we supposed that the distribution function depends only on E, (3.6) is, in fact, a general property: no\nstar can have an energy higher Ue . In Ue , the distribution function has what Chandrasekhar (1943d) calls an\n\n\fOn the dynamical evolution of globular clusters\n\n9\n\nof the field along the orbit in (3.7). Thus, the relation\nbecomes\nre \u221d M1/3\ne .\n\n(3.8)\n\nIsolated cluster\nFor future applications, we will also consider the case\nof an isolated cluster, which would experience no external\ngravitational field. Indeed, it seems that several systems\n(galaxies, galaxy clusters) are almost in this situation. In\nthis case, at a sufficiently large distance from the center,\nthe total potential reduces to UA , given in (3.3). It does\nnot yield a maximum but rather increases with distance.\nTherefore, escapes can occur only if the distribution function ranges up to E = 0, corresponding to an infinite radius for the cluster. Furthermore, we find out from (2.20)\nand (3.3):\nFigure 1: Galactic potential UG , cluster potential UA and total\npotential UG + UA .\n\n\"absorbing barrier\", and that we call here, in a more illustrative way, a \"leak\". We know that, in this case, the\nfunction f is zero for Ue , but its derivative is not; the\nvalue of the latter is proportional to the escape rate of\nthe stars (Chandrasekhar 1943d, Equations 25 and 33).\nThe galactic field has also the effect of modifying the\npotential inside the cluster. However, the equations (3.1)\nand (3.2) show that UG \u2212 UG (0) is zero in average on a\nsphere centered on the cluster; as a consequence, in our\napproximation of spherical symmetry, the galactic field\nhas no effect inside the cluster. Its effect reduces to the\ncreation of a \"leak\" at Ue .\nThe boundary of the cluster is defined by the equation U = Ue ; it is a closed surface, with a shape of a\nlemon, elongated along the x-axis (on which it has two\nconic points for x = \u00b1xe ). Therefore, the \"radius\" of the\ncluster is a function of the angle; but in the case of the\nspherical symmetry approximation, we will limit ourselves\nto considering its mean value. It is obtained from (3.3)\nand (3.4), by replacing the galactic potential UG with its\nmean value UG (0), which gives out\nre\n\n=\n=\n\nG Me\nUG (0) \u2212 Ue\n\n(3.7)\n\n\u0013\u22121/3\n\u0012 2\n\u2202 UG\n2\n2\n(G Me )1/3 \u2212\n= xe .\n2\n3\n\u2202x\n3\n\nThis is this mean value that we will refer to as the radius\nof the cluster, from now on.\nThe relation (3.7) links the radius to the mass of the\ncluster. The curvature of the galactic field can be considered as constant: we know that the dynamical evolution\nof the galaxy is much slower than that of the clusters. It is\ntrue that the cluster travels along an orbit in the galaxy;\nbut this motion is much faster than the evolution of the\ncluster, and we can use the mean value of the curvature\n\n\u03c0 G3 M3e\nq\u2032 = \u221a\n.\n8 2 (\u2212E)5/2\n\n(3.9)\n\nIn order to have a finite total mass (which is given by\nEquation 2.40), the distribution function must decrease\nsteeper than (\u2212E)3/2 for E \u2192 0. It follows that its derivative is zero at the leak point E = 0, leading to an escape\nrate of zero. This result has already be shown by means of\nanother method (H\u00e9non 1960); it is confirmed by the behavior of the artificial clusters of von Hoerner (1960) from\nwhich no stars escape, even after a time much longer than\nthe relaxation time. Therefore, for an isolated cluster, one\nhas:\nMe = cst.\n3.2\n\n(3.10)\n\nMass-radius relation\n\nThe two relations (3.8) and (3.10) can be represented by\nthe unique form:\nre \u221d M\u03bbe ,\n\n(3.11)\n\nwith \u03bb = 1/3 for globular clusters (and for any system in\na non-uniform external field in general) and \u03bb = \u221e for\nisolated clusters. We will use this general form (3.11), so\nthat the formulae obtained could be eventually applied to\nthe case of isolated clusters; but all the numerical calculations, in the present paper, will be done for \u03bb = 1/3.\nUsing (2.32c), (2.43a) and (2.36), we switch to the\ncanonical variables, and the relation (3.11) becomes:\n\u2212\n\nb c d ln (Re )\n\u2212 +\n=\u03bb\n4 2\ndT\n\n\u0012\n\n3b c d ln (Me )\n\u2212 +\n4\n2\ndT\n\n\u0013\n\n. (3.12)\n\nIf the model is in homologous evolution, Re and Me\nare independent of time, and we get:\n0 = (3\u03bb + 1)b + (2 \u2212 2\u03bb)c.\n\n(3.13)\n\nWe see that the mass-radius relation translates into a\ndefinite relation between the two parameters of the homology.\n\n\f10\n3.3\n\nM. H\u00e9non, translated by F. Renaud\nChoice of a reference level for the potential\n\nThe potential U is defined up to an additive constant. We\nset this constant by writing:\nUe = 0.\n\n(3.14)\n\nTherefore, the potential is zero at the boundary of\nthe cluster, negative inside, positive outside. The total\nenergy of a star is always negative, E = 0 corresponding\nto the escape threshold.\n4\n4.1\n\nCENTRAL CONDITIONS\nInfinite central density\n\nA priori, one could expect the density profile of the model\nwe seek to have the classical shape of Figure 2 with, in\nparticular, a well-defined central density; and our first\nattempts have been set to find this. However, the calculations of the evolution from such an initial state revealed\nan unexpected phenomenon: no matter how big the initial\nvalue of the central density is, it always increases, without\nlimits. As an example, Figure 2 shows the spacial density\ncomputed at two successive times. The horizontal axis is\nnormalized to the external radius; this way, we see that\nthe increase only concerns the central region of the cluster4 . This increase cannot be diminished by means of an\nhomologous transformation; indeed, one can measure it\nby computing the ratio between the central density and\nthe mean density of the cluster, and this ratio does not\nchange in an homology.\nTherefore, we have been led to consider, for the final\nstate of the cluster, a model with infinite central density.\nThis can seem physically absurd at first sight. However,\none should not forget that the density considered here\nis a probability density. The cluster is not made of a\ncontinuous medium, but rather of separated particles. For\nthe model to have a physical meaning, the integral of the\nprobability density must be finite over any finite volume;\nand we will see it is indeed the case.\nIn order to better emphasize this important point, we\nhave created, from a table of random numbers, an \"artificial cluster\" , that follows the projected density law\n\u03c1P \u221d\n\n1\n.\nr\n\n(4.1)\n\nThis cluster, shown in Figure 3, looks like a real galactic cluster; the fact that its theoretical density is infinite\nin its center is not visible, and if we would plot the density\nprofile from Figure 3, as one would do for real cluster, we\nwould likely state that the curve shows a finite maximum\nin the center!\nThe functional form of (4.1) is indeed the one we will\nfind near the center of the model (see Equation 5.9). Note\nthat the number of stars inside a circle of radius r is\n4 Michie (1961) has also observed a flux of stars toward the center\nof his model.\n\nFigure 2: Increase of the density in the central region of a cluster\n\nproportional to r, and thus tends toward zero when the\ncircle becomes smaller and smaller.\nIn Chapter VIII we will study in detail how this central\nsingularity of the density arises. For the time being, we\nonly focus on the final state, and thus we assume that the\nsingularity exists.\n4.2\n\nAsymptotic expressions near the center\n\n\u03c1 being infinite at the center, the function f must become\ninfinite too, as shown in (2.6). As a consequence, the first\ntwo terms of the equation (2.53), which are of the order of\nFQ, become negligible with respect to the first one which\nis of the order of F2 Q, and we have:\nS\u2032\u2032 = 0,\n\n(4.2)\n\nS = \u03b11 + \u03b12 E,\n\n(4.3)\n\ni.e., after integration,\n\nwhere \u03b11 and \u03b12 are two constants.\nLet's assume first that \u03b11 and \u03b12 are zero. In this\ncase, using (2.27) and (2.28), (4.3) reduces to\nF\nF(\u22121)\n\n=\n\nF\u2032\n,\nF\n\n(4.4)\n\nwhich immediately integrates as\nF = C1 e\u2212C2 E ,\n\n(4.5)\n\nwhere C1 and C2 are two constants, necessarily positive,\nbecause F must be positive and increasing for E \u2192 \u2212\u221e.\n\n\fOn the dynamical evolution of globular clusters\n\n11\n\ncenter of the cluster. We have, near the center:\n2\n.\n(4.8)\nR2\nAlso note that the potential is, near the center:\n1 \u0010\u03c0\u0011\n+ 2 ln (R).\n(4.9)\nU = ln\n2\n8\nTherefore, it tends logarithmically toward \u2212\u221e in the center: the cluster yields an infinite \"potential well\". As a\nconsequence, the energy of the stars can take any value\nfrom E = \u2212\u221e to E = 0.\nFinally, we have\nZ E\nF1 Q1 dE1 = 2KD eE/2 ,\n(4.10)\nD=\n\n\u2212\u221e\nE\n\nZ\n\nF1 Q\u20321 dE1\n\n3KD eE/2 .\n\n=\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nLet's go back to (4.3) in the general case where \u03b11\nand \u03b12 are not zero. For small values of \u03b11 and \u03b12 , the\nsolution of (4.3) can be expanded as:\nF = e\u2212E + \u03b11 Y1 + \u03b12 Y2 ,\n\nFigure 3: Artificial cluster with infinite central density.\n\nThis way, we find a Maxwellian distribution of the\nenergies near the center, independently of the particular\nfunctional form of Q, i.e. of the structure of the cluster.\nThis result is in agreement with what one could expect:\nin the central regions, which are very dense, the perturbations are very active and almost establish the Maxwellian\nequilibrium5 . We are now to set the two conditions that\ndefine the canonical form of the cluster (see Equation 2.31\nand the following): we assume that E and F have been\nnormalized so that the constants C1 and C2 equal unity.\nThe distribution function near the center is then:\nF = e\u2212E .\n\n(4.6)\n\nThis choice of the canonical conditions has the advantage\nof simplifying the formulae and the calculations a lot.\nFrom (4.6), using successively (2.37a), (2.37b),\n(2.37c), we easily find the expressions of the various quantities near the center:\n\u0010 \u03c0 \u00111/2\ne\u2212U ,\n(4.7)\nD =\n2\n\u0012 \u00131/4\n8\neU/2 ,\nR =\n\u03c0\nQ =\n\u0012\nKD =\n\nKD e3E/2 ,\n\u0013\n16\n\u221a\n= 0.45841 .\n9 3 (8\u03c0)1/4\n\nNote that (4.7b) is obtained as the unique solution of the\ndifferential equation (2.37b) for which D is infinite at the\n5 often called \"isothermal equilibrium\", which is a misuse of language, because the concept of temperature is meaningless in stellar\ndynamics.\n\n(4.11)\n\nwhere Y1 and Y2 are function yet to be determined. By\nsetting this in (4.3) and using (4.7c), we obtain two differential equations for Y1 and Y2 :\n(\u22121)\n\n+ 2Y1 + Y1\u2032\n\n=\n\n(\u22121)\n\n+ 2Y2 + Y2\u2032\n\n=\n\nY1\n\nY2\n\ne\u2212E/2\n,\n3KD\n(1 + E) e\u2212E/2\n,\n3KD\n\n(4.12)\n\nwhich can be solved as\nY1\nY2\n\n2 \u2212E/2\ne\n,\n(4.13)\n3KD\n2\n= C21 e\u2212E + C22 E e\u2212E +\n(5 \u2212 E) e\u2212E/2 .\n3KD\n\n= C11 e\u2212E + C12 E e\u2212E \u2212\n\nThe Cij are arbitrary constants. The terms Cij are,\nin fact, parasite solutions coming from a bad normalization of F(E); we can get rid of them by modifying this\nnormalization. Then, F reads\nF = e\u2212E +\n\n2\n(5\u03b12 \u2212 \u03b11 \u2212 \u03b12 E) e\u2212E/2 .\n3KD\n\n(4.14)\n\nThe second term of this expansion becomes negligible\nwith respect to the first one, for all \u03b11 and \u03b12 , when E is\nsmall enough. As a consequence, the expansion (4.14) is\nvalid near the center, not only for small \u03b11 and \u03b12 , but\nfor any values they can take. Thus, we have found the\ngeneral solution of (4.3), i.e. the functional form of the\ndistribution function, for E \u2192 \u2212\u221e.6\n\n6 The expression (4.14) can be considered as an expansion of F\nup to the second order in eE/2 ; however, it has been obtained using\nthe expansion of Q up to the first order, (4.7c). This method is\nvalid because S cancels when F takes the form (4.6), for all Q's.\nWe easily find out that the expansion of S up to the n-th order\ndepends on the expansion of F up to the n-th order, and on the\nexpansion of Q up to the (n \u2212 1)-th order only. Therefore, it is\npossible to consider one term less in the expansion of Q than in\nthose of F.\n\n\f12\n\nM. H\u00e9non, translated by F.

This calculation will allow\nus to give a physical meaning to the constants \u03b11 and\n\u03b12 , and to specify the conditions the model must fulfill\nnear the center of the cluster.

However, here again, it is not\npossible to use (4.22) and (4.28) to demonstrate (4.27),\nbecause an integration constant would remain undefined.\n(The quantity H, that we called \"total energy of the\nsubset PE \", has been computed by simply adding the\ntotal energies E of its members, which is not correct, because by doing this, we count twice the mutual potential\nenergy of the stars of PE . However, this effect is negligible if PE only counts a small fraction of the stars of the\ncluster, which is the case for E \u2192 \u2212\u221e.)\nNear the center, one can neglect the last term of\n(4.22), and the two last terms of (4.27), which are of the\norder of eE/2 ; we also replace S with its value, given in\n(4.3) and (2.32f), and we get\n\u2202M\n\u2202T\n\u2202H\n\u2202T\n\n= \u03b2 3/4 \u03b3 1/2 \u03b12 ,\n\n(4.30)\n\n= \u2212\u03b2 7/4 \u03b3 1/2 \u03b11 .\n\nThus, the two constants \u03b11 and \u03b12 represent, up to a\nfactor, the fluxes of mass and of energy toward the center\nof the cluster. This result is unexpectedly simple.\nNote that we can switch to the canonical variables\nthanks to (2.32e) and (2.43); H has still the same dimension as L. By neglecting once more the terms in eE/2 , we\nobtain:\n\u2202M\n\u2202T\n\u2202H\n\u2202T\n\n= \u03b12 ,\n\nthe central density slowly increases until it becomes infinite. Then, the flow of matter toward the center exists\nand simply corresponds to the slow \"filling\" of the central\npart of the density profile (see Figure 2).\nLet's consider now the flux of energy, given by (4.30b).\nThis flux is also constant near the center: therefore the\ncenter of the cluster creates or absorbs energy. One could\nthink that, in analogy with what is true for the mass, the\nflow of energy must be zero in the center. But the numerical computation shows (see the next Chapter) that the\npreviously written condition (4.32) completed the definition of the solution of the system of equations, which is\nnow unique; and this solution corresponds to a value of\n\u03b11 that is positive and non zero. Thus, we have to admit that a flow of energy toward the center exists; more\nprecisely: the center of the cluster absorbs some negative\nenergy.\nWe will come back with more details to this strange\nand very interesting phenomenon in the Chapter V, and\nwe will see how it can be physically interpreted.\n4.4\n\nFollow-up on the expansions near the center\n\nTo prepare the numerical computation, it is useful to push\nfurther the expansions of the various quantities near the\ncenter. Taking the relation (4.32) into account and setting\n\u2212\n\n(4.31)\n\n= \u2212\u03b11 .\n\nWe are now going to examine the physical meaning of\nthese fluxes. Let's focus first on the flux of mass. (4.30a)\nshows that, near the center, it takes a constant value,\nindependent of E; this means that a flow of matter enters\nor exits the cluster (depending on the sign of \u03b12 ) through\nthe central singularity. The fundamental equations do not\nrule out such a flow; one can even, as we will see, create\nan infinite number of models obeying the equations and\nyielding a non-zero flow of matter in the center. However,\nfrom a physical point of view, such a flow obviously does\nnot make sense. This leads us to write the additional\ncondition\n\u03b12 = 0.\n(4.32)\nThe need of writing a separate condition for the mass\nconservation in the center can be more easily explained:\nat the center of the cluster, the quantities become infinite\nand the fundamental equations are meaningless; thus an\nadditional condition is required for this particular point.\nFor that matter, we have already noted, just above, that\nit is impossible to go directly from the equation of evolution (2.22) to the Equation (4.21) which states the conversation of the mass; one constant is missing, which is\nprecisely the value of the central flow.\nHowever, the models with a non-zero central flow are\nuseful: we will see them again in Chapter VII, while\nstudying the initial stages of the evolution, during which\n\n13\n\n2\u03b11\n= K,\n3KD\n\n(4.33)\n\nthe expansion (4.14) of F reduces to\nF = e\u2212E + K e\u2212E/2 .\n\n(4.34)\n\nBy using successively the fundamental equations\n(2.37a), (2.37b), (2.37c), we find out the two-terms expansions:\nD =\nR\n\n=\n\nQ\n\n=\n\n\u0011\n\u221a\ne\u2212U + 2 2 K e\u2212U/2 ,\n2\n\u0013\n\u0012 \u00131/4 \u0012\nK\n8\neU/2 \u2212 \u221a eU ,\n\u03c0\n2\n!\n\u221a\n9 3\n3E/2\n2E\n\u2212 \u221a K e\nKD e\n,\n8 2\n\n\u0010 \u03c0 \u00111/2 \u0010\n\n(4.35)\n\nthat make (4.7) more precise. From a remark made above,\nwe can compute the expansion of F at the third order by\nputting in (2.53) the expansion of Q at the second order\nonly, given by (4.35c). The last two terms of (2.53) must\nnow be taken into account. We find:\n!\n\u221a\n3\n3 3 2\n(\u22121)\n\u2212E\n\u2212E/2\nF\n= \u2212e \u2212 2K e\n+\nb\u2212 \u221a K ,\n2\n8 2\nF = e\u2212E + K e\u2212E/2 + 0.\n\n(4.36)\n\nThe third term in the expansion of F is zero.\nWe stop the expansions here because the calculation of the terms of higher order is much more involved:\nthe third term of D is not constant but proportional to\n\n\f14\n\nM. H\u00e9non, translated by F. Renaud\n\n(\u2212U)1/2 and its coefficient depends on the entire function\nF. Therefore, we will use the expansions (4.35) for D, R,\nQ.

Experience leads us to adopt the following iterative\nmethod:\n1. Choose a temporary form for the function F, that\nfulfills (5.3a) and (5.3c), with a temporary value of\nK;\n2. compute D using (5.2a);\n\n2. The integral (2.37c) is transformed by means of an\nintegration by parts.\n\n3. The equation (2.53) is replaced with its integrated\nform with respect to E; we have seen in Chapter IV\nthat the integration constant is zero.\n\nAll the equations, modified this way, and the boundary conditions are gathered below:\n\n3. compute Z by integrating (5.2b) from the center\nto the boundary; the initial conditions are given in\n(5.3d);\n4. compute Q by means of (5.2c) and (5.2d);\n5. choose temporary values for c and K; compute b using (5.2f);\n6. integrate (5.2e), which is equivalent to a differential\nsystem of the fourth order, from the center to the\nboundary; the initial conditions are given in (5.3c),\n(4.36a) and (4.37);\n\n\fOn the dynamical evolution of globular clusters\n\n15\n\n7. in general, this integration gives the final values of\nF(0) and F(\u22121) (0) that are different from zero; go\nback to point [5.], modify c or K and begin the integration again; grope around this way for the values\nof c and K until F(0) and F(\u22121) (0) vanish;\n8. go back to point [2.] with the new function F.\nThis way, we obtain a series of approximations for F;\nwe stop when two successive approximations are equal,\nup to the desired precision. In practice, the convergence\nis quite fast: the errors are divided by about 5 at each\niteration.\nThe computation has been done thanks to the IBM\n650 device of the Observatoire de Meudon; 8 hours of\ncomputation are required to get the solution with a precision of 1/1000.\n5.3\n\nResults: structure\n\nThe four fundamental functions F, D, R, Q are given in\nTable 1 and plotted in Figure 4. The table covers the\nrange (\u22125, 0); below E = \u22125 (or U = \u22125), the functions are represented with a sufficient precision by the\nexpressions (4.34) and (4.35).

It increases very rapidly toward the\ncenter, as expected from (4.8). The structure of the model\nis perhaps better rendered in Figure 6, which shows the\nmass fraction MR enclosed in a sphere of radius R (see\nEquation 2.45). Near the center, MR is proportional to\nR. We note that half of the total mass is enclosed inside\nthe radius R = 0.6800, i.e. only about 1/7 of the external\nradius.\nThe potential U vanishes at the boundary of the cluster, according to our conventions; outside the cluster, its\nform is obtained by integrating (2.45):\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n1\nU = Me\nfor R > Re .\n(5.6)\n\u2212\nRe\nR\nIn particular, for R \u2192 \u221e, the potential tends toward:\nU\u221e =\n\nMe\n= 0.4243.\nRe\n\n(This is the potential created by the cluster only.)\n\n(5.7)\n\nFigure 5: Homologous model: spacial density and projected density as a function of the radius.\n\n\f16\n\nM.

Near the center, from (4.35a) et (4.35b), the\nspatial density is expressed as a function of the radius as:\n(8\u03c0)1/4 K\n2\n+\n.\n2\nR\nR\n\nD=\n\n(5.8)\n\nWe find\n2\u03c0\n\u2212 2(8\u03c0)1/4 K ln (R) + KP\nDP =\nR\n\nfor R \u2192 0,\n\n(5.9)\nwhere KP is a constant which depends on the entire function D. By linking the formula (5.9) with the values of\nTable 1, one finds KP \u2243 \u22123.82.\nThe projected mass (mass enclosed, in projection, inside a circle of radius R), computed from the formula\n(2.51), is given in Table 1, column 7. In particular, we\nfind out the value of the median radius R0 of the cluster, defined as the radius of the circle which contains, in\nprojection, half of the total mass. This quantity has the\nadvantage of being easily measured for real clusters, while\nthe external radius is, on the contrary, almost impossible\nto observe. We find\nR0 = 0.4997.\n\n(5.10)\n\nWe note that this median radius R0 is about 10 times\nsmaller than the external radius Re .\n5.4\n\nThe \"time\" T is defined by the differential equation\n(2.32e); it is not proportional to the physical time T . It is,\nsomehow, the \"proper time\" of the cluster; its variation\nis measured with a scale which is proper to the cluster,\nand which always varies according to the evolution. To\navoid any confusion, it is preferable to consider T as a\nsimple parameter which measures the level of evolution\nof the cluster, as it is in (5.11).\nThe relation between T and the physical time T ,\nfound from (2.32e) and (5.11b), is\n1\nT = \u2212 ln (1 \u2212 \u03b30 c T ),\nc\n\n(by setting the origin of time at T = 0 for T = 0). This\nrelation is plotted in Figure 7. We see that the evolution\ndoes not last forever, but rather ends abruptly at a time\nT1 , given by\n1\n.\n(5.13)\nT1 =\n\u03b30 c\nFor T = T1 , the mass of the cluster becomes zero, as\nwe will see below; it is therefore the time when the cluster\ndisappears, after the escape of the last stars.\nHowever, the curve extends forever in the past: the\nage of the cluster can be anything, it is not possible to\ngive it an upper limit.\nWhen introducing (5.12) in (5.11), and taking (5.4c)\ninto account, we obtain the variation laws of the two parameters of the homology:\n\u03b2\n\n=\n\n\u03b3\n\n=\n\nEvolution\n\nWhen integrating (2.36), we get\n\u03b2\n\u03b3\n\n=\n=\n\n\u03b20 ebT ,\n\u03b30 e\n\ncT\n\n,\n\n(5.11)\n\n(5.12)\n\n\u00132/3\n\u0012\nT\n,\n\u03b20 1 \u2212\nT1\n\u0012\n\u0013\u22121\nT\n\u03b30 1 \u2212\n.\nT1\n\n(5.14)\n\nWe derive, from (2.32), (2.43), (2.48), the variations\nof the various physical quantities as functions of time.

The density is constant, and as\na consequence, the orbital period of the stars within\nthe cluster is also constant. The velocities decrease as\n(1 \u2212 T /T1 )1/3 . The total energy of the cluster decreases\n(in absolute value) as (1 \u2212 T /T1 )5/3 , thus faster than the\nmass.\n5.5\n\nAccumulation of negative energy in the center\n\nAs we have seen in the previous Chapter, a non-zero value\nof K implies the existence of a flow of energy toward the\ncenter. This energy cannot vanish; we must admit that it\nconstitutes an energy reservoir.\nThus, the total energy of the cluster is always made\nof two parts:\n\u2022 a \"point\" energy H1 , accumulated in the center of\nthe cluster;\n\u2022 a \"diffuse\" energy H2 , distributed within the entire\ncluster.\nLet's look at how these two fractions of the energy vary\nwith time. The variation of H1 equals the flux of energy\ntoward the center, i.e., from (4.30b) and (4.33):\ndH1\n3\n= \u03b2 7/4 \u03b3 1/2 KD K.\n(5.16)\ndT\n2\nThe diffuse energy H2 is, from the virial theorem:\nH2 = \u2212Le ,\n\n(5.17)\n\nwhere Le is the total kinetic energy of the cluster; this\nrelation remains valid as soon as the potential is set to\nzero at infinity (instead of the convention Ue = 0 adopted\nup to now). Therefore, from (2.43b) and (5.2f), we have:\ndH2\ndT\n\n=\n=\n\n\u2212\u03b3\n\ndLe\ndT\u0012\n\n\u2212\u03b3 Le\n\n(5.18)\n7\n1\nb\u2212 c\n4\n2\n\n\u0013\n\n= \u03b2 7/4 \u03b3 1/2\n\n4 \u2212 2\u03bb\nLe c.\n3\u03bb + 1\n\nWe can finally compute the total variation of energy\nH1 + H2 of the cluster. This variation is only due to the\nfact that the stars escape taking some energy away with\nthem. The difference of gravitational potential between\nthe boundary of the cluster and infinity is U\u221e given by\n(5.7). Therefore, each star that escapes takes away a mass\nm1 and a negative energy, equal to \u2212m1 U\u221e . The escape\nrate is, from (2.43a) and (5.2f):\n\u0012\n\u0013\n3\ndMe\n1\ndMe\n=\u03b3\n= \u03b3 Me\nb\u2212 c\n(5.19)\ndT\ndT\n4\n2\n2\nMe c,\n= \u2212\u03b2 3/4 \u03b3 1/2\n3\u03bb + 1\n\nd(H1 + H2 )\n2 M2e\nc.\n= \u03b2 7/4 \u03b3 1/2\ndT\n3\u03bb + 1 Re\n\n(5.20)\n\nThe comparison of (5.16), (5.18), (5.20) shows that we\nmust have:\n3\nM2e\n4 \u2212 2\u03bb\n2\nc.\nKD K +\nLe c =\n2\n3\u03bb + 1\n3\u03bb + 1 Re\n\n(5.21)\n\nwhich expresses the conservation of energy. This relation\nbetween the parameters of the model provides a useful\nverification of the calculations. When using the numerical values (5.4) and (5.5), and when omitting the factor\n\u03b2 7/4 \u03b3 1/2 , we get:\ndH1\ndT\ndH2\ndT\nd(H1 + H2 )\ndT\n\n=\n\n\u22120.6464,\n\n=\n\n+0.9672,\n\n=\n\n+0.3455.\n\n(5.22)\n\nThe conservation of energy is quite well verified; the\ndiscrepancy that remains comes from the errors in the\ncomputation (mainly the error made in Re ).\nThus, in the course of the evolution, the diffuse energy H2 , always negative according to (5.17), decreases\nin absolute value; the numerical values (5.22) show that\nabout one third of the negative energy is taken away by\nthe stars that escape, while the other two thirds go in the\ncenter.\nIt remains to explain the mechanism of this accumulation of energy in the center. It is not associated with an\naccumulation of matter; we have supposed that the flux\nof matter toward the center of the cluster is zero (and\nthis is indeed necessary, because a central condensation\nof mass would create an additional potential that would\nmodify the structure of the cluster; for example the potential would vary as 1/r and not ln (r) anymore, near\nthe center). Thus, the negative energy H1 must be stored\nwithout any increase of the number of stars. Apparently,\nthere is only one process that allows this: the formation of\ntight binary or multiple stars in the center of the cluster.\nThe direct observation cannot confirm the existence of\nthis phenomenon: the images of the stars are sorely separated [T.N.: resolved] in the central region of the globular\nclusters, and it would be impossible to discover there the\npresence of a particularly compact group of stars. On the\nother hand, von Hoerner (1960) has computed numerically the evolution of artificial clusters; by this means, it\nis possible to observe the mechanism of the evolution, in\nas much detail as desired. von Hoerner has indeed noted\nthe frequent formation of binaries in the center of the\ncluster; in one case, a compact group of 4 stars appeared.\nThis seems an excellent confirmation of the process that\nwe have been led to admit.\nNote again that this central accumulation of energy\ndoes not affect the structure of the cluster, except for the\n\n\fOn the dynamical evolution of globular clusters\nfew stars that support it; thus, it can develop independently of the global evolution of the cluster. In fact, we\nhave seen that the absolute value of the central energy\nincreases, while that of the diffuse energy decreases. At\nthe end of the evolution, about two thirds of the initial\nnegative energy is in the central condensation, and one\nthird only has left the cluster, carried by the stars. It\nwould be very interesting, although not possible here, to\nstudy in more detail the process of accumulation and to\nanswer in particular the following questions: how do multiple stars form? How many are there? What happens to\nthem after the cluster has disappeared?\n\n6\n\nSTARS WITH DIFFERENT MASSES\n\nthe transformation of (2.24):\n\u0014\nZ E\n\u2202\n0 =\n\u03bcF2\nF1 Q\u20321 dE1\n\u2202E\n\u2212\u221e\nZ\nZ E\n+F2\u2032\nF1 Q1 dE1 + Q\n+F2\u2032\n\n(6.3)\n\u221e\n\nF1 dE1\n\nE\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n19\n\n!\u0015\n\n\u2202F2\n\u2202Q\n\u2212 Q\u2032\n,\n\u2202T\n\u2202T\n\nwhere we set:\n\nm2\n= \u03bc.\n(6.4)\nm1\nThis equation has the dimension of F2 ; therefore, we\ncan apply an homologous transformation to F2 , independently of those of F1 . Thus, we set\nF2 = \u03b32 F2 .\n\nThe case of a cluster with an arbitraty mass distribution\nseems much more involved than the simple case of equal\nmasses that we have considered so far; thus we shall not\nseek to treat it in the general case. But we are going to\nsee that some simplified cases allow easy calculations, and\nprovide, not a complete and rigorous solution, but at least\nseveral indications about the effect of the dispersion of the\nmasses. We will first assume that we add a small number\nof stars of different masses to a cluster that contains equal\nmass stars, and will study the behavior of this secondary\npopulation. Later, this study will help us to obtain an\napproximate solution to the general case.\n\nTherefore the homology now depends on the three parameters \u03b2, \u03b3, \u03b32 .

One\ncan neglect the perturbations between the stars of the\npopulation 2, and the equation becomes, after applying\n\n(6.7)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n+F\u20322\n\n\u0012Z\n\nE\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\nF1 Q1 dE1 + Q\nF1 dE1\nE\n\u0013\n3\n3\nb \u2212 c F2 Q\n+\n4\n2\n)\n\u0012\n\u0013Z E\n3\n3\n+\nc \u2212 b \u2212 c2\nF2 Q\u20321 dE1 .\n2\n4\n\u2212\u221e\n\u0012\n\nSimplified model made of two populations\n\nWe suppose that the cluster is made of the mix of a main\npopulation 1 of stars of mass m1 , and of a secondary\npopulation 2, numerically negligible with respect to the\nfirst one, of stars of mass m2 . The distribution function\nis not (2.23) anymore but rather:\n\n(6.6)\n\nand when continuing the calculation, as in the Chapter II,\nwe obtain the equation\n(\nZ\n\u2212\u221e\n\n6.1\n\n(6.5)\n\n\u0013\n\nIn this equation, F1 , Q or Q1 , b, c are the functions and constants of the homologous model, given in\nthe Chapter V; the function F2 and the constant c2 are\nunknown.\nThe boundary conditions are only:\nF2 (0) = 0,\n\n(6.8)\n\nwhich tells us that the stars of the population 2 escape\nwhen they reach the boundary of the cluster.\nNear the center, on the other hand, we can neglect the\nlast terms of (6.7) in a first order approximation, and use\nthe asymptotical expressions (4.6) and (4.7c) for F1 and\nQ; the equation becomes:\n\u03bc F2 + F\u20322 = 0.\n\n(6.9)\n\nF2 = C e\u2212\u03bcE ,\n\n(6.10)\n\nand thus\nwhere C is an arbitrary constant. The equation (6.10) is\nas expected: indeed, it shows that the Maxwellian equilibrium is realised in the central region of the cluster between\nthe two populations.\n\n\f20\n\nM. H\u00e9non, translated by F. Renaud\n\n6.1.1\n\nThe \u03bc \u2265 3/2 case\n\nThis functional form for F2 has a strange consequence.\nThe mass of the subset of stars of the population 2 whose\nenergy is below E is, from (2.40a):\nZ E\nM2 = 16\u03c0 2 m2\nF2 q1\u2032 dE1 ,\n(6.11)\n\u2212\u221e\n\ni.e., when switching to normalized variables, and then to\nthe canonical variables,\nZ E\nF2 Q\u20321 dE1 .\n(6.12)\nM2 = \u03bc\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u2032\n\nQ is given near the center by (4.7c), i.e.,\nQ\u2032 =\n\n3\nKD e3E/2 .\n2\n\n(6.13)\n\nWhen using this form and (6.10), we immediately see\nthat the integral (6.12) diverges if\n3\n\u03bc\u2265 .\n2\n\nln (C \u03b32 /\u03b3)\n.\n\u03bc\u22121\n\n(6.15)\n\nUsing the formula (6.13) for Q\u2032 is only meaningful\nwhen E \u226b Ec . On the contrary, for E \u226a Ec , F1 becomes\nnegligible with respect to F2 . Then, we can obtain the\nnew forms of D, R, Q by using (6.10) and the fundamental equations. In particular, we get\nQ\u2032 =\n\nC \u03b32 5/4 3\n\u03bc\nKD e3\u03bc\n\u03b3\n2\n\nE/2\n\nfor E \u226a Ec\n\n(6.16)\n\n[T.N.: The c subscript is missing in the original version.]\nand with this correct form, the integral (6.12) does not\ndiverge anymore. The quantity F2 Q\u2032 yields a maximum\nin the vicinity of E = Ec and exponentially decreases in\nboth sides. We can compute the mass M2 in an approximate way by assuming that Q\u2032 is given by (6.16) when\nE < Ec and by (6.13) when E > Ec ; we find\n\u0012\n(6.17)\nM2 = 3KD \u03bc\u22125/4\n+\n\n3\n3\nc \u2212 b \u2212 c2 = 0.\n2\n4\n\n(6.14)\n\nIn other words, in this case, the mass of the population 2 is infinite, because of a too rapid increase of the\ndistribution function (and of the density) toward the center.\nThis anomaly is easy to explain. We have assumed\nin (6.2) that F2 is always negligible with respect to F1 ;\nhowever, when comparing the asymptotical forms (4.6)\nand (6.10) of these two functions, we can see that when\n\u03bc is greater than unity, F2 increases faster than F1 for\nE \u2192 \u2212\u221e, and that, a value of E below which F2 becomes\nlarger than F1 always exists, however small the constant\nC. This critical value is (from Equations 2.31b and 6.5)\nEc =\n\nM2 does not depend on E anymore; indeed, because of\nthe form of F2 Q\u2032 , almost all the stars of the population 2\nhave an energy of the order of magnitude of Ec , therefore\nare part of M2 for E \u226b Ec .\nWe focus here on the extreme case where the population 2 is negligible with respect to the population 1;\ntherefore C must be very small compared to unity. For\nC \u2192 0, (6.15) shows that Ec \u2192 \u2212\u221e. This way, we obtain\nthe following result: the stars whose mass is greater than\n3/2 times the mean mass are almost all gathered near the\ncenter of the cluster. Obviously, this conclusion is related\nto the simplified mass distribution that we have adopted,\nand should not be extended without further study to the\ncase of an arbitrary mass distribution.\nWe also notice that M2 is not proportional to C: the\npower of C in (6.17) is less than unity. As a consequence,\nfor C \u2192 0, the last term of the equation (6.7) decreases\nslower than the others, which are proportional to C. In\nthe limit, the equation becomes\n\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u00131/(2\u03bc\u22122)\n\u03b3 C \u03b32\n\u03bc\n2\u03bc \u2212 3 \u03b32\n\u03b3\n\nfor E \u226b Ec ,\n\n(6.18)\n\nLet's divide all the terms of (6.7) by C; the last term\nis then, for C \u2192 0, an indeterminate form 0 \u00d7 \u221e.

Indeed,\nin his computation he assumes that the stars must first\nadopt a Maxwellian distribution (and thus, high velocities\nfor the low-mass stars), before being able to escape. In\nreality, as we have seen, the stars escape almost as soon\nas they have reach their escape velocity.\nPrevious works (van den Bergh 1957; Takase 1960)\nused the escape rate provided by Chandrasekhar to calculate the initial mass function of open clusters from their\npresent-day mass function; it would be advisable to do\nthese calculations again with a more exact escape rate.\nIn particular, the abnormal lack of low-mass stars, found\nby Takase in the initial distribution of the Pleiades, is\nlikely to disappear.\n6.4\n\nFigure 10: Escape rate as a function of mass. [T.N.: The legend\nreads Pr\u00e9sent mod\u00e8le: this model.]\n\nBetween \u03bc = 0 and \u03bc = 3/2, the escape rate decreases\nregularly, as one would expect. The very low-mass stars\n(\u03bc \u2243 0) escape about 3.5 times faster than the mean-mass\nstars.\nThe escape rates computed by Chandrasekhar (1942)\nand by Spitzer & Harm (1958), normalized so that they\nall take the same value for \u03bc = 1, are also plotted in Figure 10. We can see that the three curves are very different,\nespecially for the low masses. This shows strikingly the\nlack of rigor of the cluster theory, in its present state.\nIt is quite obvious, however, that the less massive stars\nmust escape faster. The fact that the curve from Chan-\n\nApproximation in the general case\n\nWe are going to show that the results obtained above in\nthe case of the very special mass distribution (6.1) allow\nus to solve in an approximate way the general case of any\nmass distribution.\nIn general, the distribution function takes the form\n(2.4): f (E, m, t). Let nm dm be the number of stars of\nthe cluster whose mass is between m and m + dm; we\neasily derive (see Equations 2.38 and 2.40)\nnm = 16\u03c0\n\n2\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nf q \u2032 dE.\n\n(6.24)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nnm depends on m and also on t, because of the escape.\nThe total number of stars and the total mass are given\nby\nZ \u221e\nnm dm,\n(6.25)\nn =\n0\nZ \u221e\nMe =\nnm m dm.\n0\n\n\fOn the dynamical evolution of globular clusters\nThe mean mass and the quadratic mean mass are defined by means of the classical formulae:\nZ\n1 \u221e\nMe\nm =\n,\n(6.26)\nnm dm =\nn 0\nn\nZ \u221e\n1\nm2 =\nnm m2 dm.\nn 0\nThis done, let's consider the fundamental equations (2.6)\nand (2.22). We can switch the order of integration with\nrespect to m and E. Then, we notice that m can be\nremoved if we introduce the two functions:\nZ \u221e\nf m dm = J1 (E, t),\n(6.27)\nZ 0\u221e\nf m2 dm = J2 (E, t).\n0\n\nJ1 and J2 are \"mean distribution functions\", obtained by\nweighting in two ways the distribution functions corresponding to the different values of the mass. To come\nback to equations already solved, we have to make an\napproximation: we suppose that theses two mean distribution functions are similar up to a factor. In this case,\nthe equations (6.24) and (6.26) show that J1 and J2 must\nbe proportional to m and m2 respectively, and thus we\nset\nJ1 (E, t)\nJ2 (E, t)\n\n=\n\nm F (E, t),\n\n=\n\nm2\n\n+m2 f \u2032\n\nE\n\nF1 q1 dE1\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n+q\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\nE\n\nF1 dE1\n\n\u0013\u0015\n\n+f\n\n\u2032 \u2202q\n\n\u2202t\n\n\u2212q\n\n\u2032 \u2202f\n\n\u2202t\n\n)\n\n.\n\nThe other two fundamental equations, (2.7) and\n(2.19), do not involve the mass, and thus are not modified. We now define the normalized variables by means of\ntransformations, slightly different from (2.24):\n\u03c1\nr\n\n= 4\u03c0 m D\n= (16\u03c0 2 G m)\u22121/2 R\n\nq\n\n= (16\u03c0 2 G m)\u22123/2 Q\n\ndt\n\nm\nm2\n\n(6.31)\n\n= [16\u03c0 2 G2 m2 ln (n)]\u22121 dT.\n\nWe easily check that, this way, we retrieve the equations (2.25) which have been obtained for the case of equal\n\nm=\u03bc\n\n(6.32)\n\nand replacing f with F2 , we find that the equation (6.30)\ntransforms into (6.3), i.e. the equation obtained at the\nbeginning of this Chapter for the simplified model. It\nfollows that the detailed distribution function f is represented, for the different masses, by the solutions F2 of the\nsimplified model taking (6.32) into account.\nFrom the previous relation, we note that \u03bc is the relative mass computed by considering the mass unit to be,\nnot the mean mass m, but rather\nm0 =\n\nm2\n,\nm\n\n(6.33)\n\nwhich is different, in practice, by a factor greater than 2\n(see Equation 8.9, below).\nFinally, we note that the transformation equations\n(2.41) and (2.47) must be replaced with:\nM =\n\nF (E, t).\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u0012Z\n\nmass stars.

We\nwill first consider the case of a cluster that differs from\nthe homologous model because its central density is finite;\nthen the case of a cluster with infinite central density but\nwith differences in the global structure. In both cases,\nthe calculation will only be approximate. Finally, the\nresults will be combined to draw a general picture of the\nevolution of the cluster.\n7.1\n\nFormation of the central singularity\n\nLet's consider a cluster that matches the homologous\nmodel everywhere, except in a small central region, where\nit differs so that its central density is finite. The central potential is then also finite; let's call it U0 . Near\nthe center, the radius R is proportional to (U \u2212 U0 )1/2 ;\nFrom (5.2d), we easily derive that Q is proportional to\n(E \u2212 U0 )3 . If we assume that the distribution function\nF also remains finite in the center, we find that FQ\u2032 is\nproportional to (E \u2212 U0 )2 near the center. It will be\n\n\f24\n\nM.

Renaud\nence of mass between the present model and the homologous one is therefore\n\u2206M = M \u2212 M0 = \u2212KD eE1 /2 .\n\n(7.4)\n\nIn the same way, we compute the total energy of the stars\nwhose [T.N.: individual] energy is less than E1 :\nZ E1\nEFQ\u2032 dE = (6 + 2U0 )KD eE1 /2 (7.5)\nH =\nU0\n\n=\n\nH0\n\n(6 + 3U0 )KD eE1 /2 ,\n\nthus,\n\u2206H = H \u2212 H0 = \u2212KD U0 eE1 /2 .\n\n(7.6)\n\nThe definition (7.1) of the model is partly arbitrary.\nOne can redo the calculations above for other definitions\n(for example, when supposing that Q\u2032 rather than FQ\u2032 is\nrepresented by a parabola near the center); we note that\nthe results are always\n\u2206M\n\u2206H\n\nFigure 11: Homologous model (dashed line) and simplified model,\nwith finite central density (solid line).\n\nuseful, for the next calculations, to have a formula for\nFQ\u2032 as simple as possible; therefore, we define a simplified model by means of the following conditions: below a\ngiven value E = E1 , FQ\u2032 is proportional to (E \u2212 U0 )2 ;\nabove this value, it is as the homologous model. In addition, the function and its derivative must be continuous\nfor E = E1 (Figure 11). These conditions translate into:\nE1\n\n=\n\nFQ\u2032\n\n=\n\nU0 + 4\n\uf8f1 3\nE1 /2\n\uf8f4\n(E \u2212 U0 )2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 32 KD e\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 3 K eE/2\nD\n2\n\n(7.1)\nfor U0 < E < E1\nfor E > E1\n\nWe now suppose that the formula (7.1) is valid not\nonly initially, but always, although the central potential\nU0 is a function of the time. Thus the evolution of the\ncluster consists in two phenomena that overlap: the normal homologous evolution, and the variation of the structure of a small central region. We will see that the latter\ncan quite easily be computed when considering the fluxes\nof mass and energy toward the center of the cluster.\nThe partial mass of the stars whose energy is less than\nE1 is, for the model considered here (see Equation 2.42)\nM=\n\nZ\n\n=\n=\n\nk1 eU0 /2\n(k1 U0 + k2 )eU0 /2 ,\n\n(7.7)\n\nwhere k1 and k2 are two numerical constants, the values\nof which are slightly different from one model to the other.\nIn the present case, we have\nk1\nk2\n\n=\n=\n\n\u2212KD e2 = \u22123.387\n0.\n\n(7.8)\n\nBy computing the derivative of (7.7) with respect to\ntime, we obtain the fluxes of mass and energy toward the\ncenter:\n\u2202M\n\u2202T\n\u2202H\n\u2202T\n\nk1 U0 /2 dU0\ne\n2\ndT\n1\ndU0\n(k1 U0 + 2k1 + k2 )eU0 /2\n.\n2\ndT\n\n=\n=\n\n(7.9)\n\nThese fluxes are related, through the equations (4.31),\nto the factors \u03b11 and \u03b12 that appear in the expansion\n(4.14) of F. It is more handy to write this expansion as\nF = e\u2212E + (K + K2 E) e\u2212E/2 ,\n\n(7.10)\n\nby setting\n2\n(5\u03b12 \u2212 \u03b11 )\n3KD\n2\n\u2212\n\u03b12\n3KD\n\n= K\n\n(7.11)\n\n= K2 .\n\nThen, we obtain the relations:\n\nE1\n\nFQ\u2032 dE = 2KD eE1 /2 .\n\n(7.2)\n\nU0\n\nFor the homologous model, this mass would be, from\n(4.10b)\nM0 = 3KD eE1 /2 .\n(7.3)\nFurthermore, the mass of the stars whose energy is\ngreater than E1 is the same for both models. The differ-\n\nK\n\n=\n\nK2\n\n=\n\nk1 U0 + 7k1 + k2 U0 /2 dU0\ne\n3KD\ndT\nk1 U0 /2 dU0\ne\n\u2212\n3KD\ndT\n\n(7.12)\n\nFurthermore, we have seen in Chapter V that the\nboundary conditions require two relations for the parameters of the model. In the case of the homologous model,\n\n\fOn the dynamical evolution of globular clusters\n\n25\n\nK2 is zero, and the other two parameters K and c are determined uniquely. Here, there are three parameters: K,\nK2 and c. Therefore, the boundary conditions require,\nafter canceling of c, a relation between K and K2 . As the\nmodels considered here are close to the homologous one,\nK2 is slightly different from zero, and we can assume that\nthe relation is linear, i.e.\nK = K0 + d K2 ,\n\n(7.13)\n\nwhere K0 is the value taken by K in the homologous\nmodel, and d is a constant.\nTo find this constant, two models have been computed\nwith a non-zero K2 . The procedure is as in Chapter V,\nbut the initial condition (5.3c) has to be replaced with\n(7.10); the other initial expansions have, of course, to\nbe modified accordingly. While doing this, we assume\nthat the first order expansions (4.7) are still valid; indeed\nthese new models differ significantly from the homologous\nmodel only in the small central region, i.e. for very small\nvalues of E or U. Near the boundary, the modification\nonly affects the second order terms in the expansions, as\nvisible for example in (7.10).\nThe results about the relation between K and K2 are:\nK2\n0\n-0.01\n-0.1\n\nK\n-0.938464\n-0.931757\n-0.87028\n\n(K2 = 0 corresponds to the homologous model; the\nvalue obtained here is slightly different from that of Chapter V, Equation 5.4a, because of a larger integration step).\nWe verify that these figures match well a linear relation\nof the type (7.13) with\nFigure 12: Evolution of the central potential.\n\nd = \u22120.6707.\n\n(7.14)\n\nWhen combining the relations (7.12) and (7.13), we\nget\ndU0\ndT\n\n=\n\ne\u2212U0 /2\n3KD K0\nk1\nU0 + 7 + d + k2 /k1\n\n(7.15)\n\n\u2212U0 /2\n\n=\n\n0.3816 e\n.\nU0 + 6.329\n\nThis differential equation allows to compute the variation of the central potential U0 as a function of time,\nand thus to solve our problem. Its explicit solution is:\nT \u2212 T2 = 5.241(U0 + 4.329) eU0 /2 ,\n\n(7.16)\n\nwhere T2 is a constant. This relation is plotted in Figure 12. We first note that the central potential U0 decreases with time, which corresponds to an increase of\nthe central density, and to getting closer to the homologous model. Furthermore, this decrease gets faster and\nfaster, so that the central potential becomes \u2212\u221e after a\nfinite timelapse: the cluster reaches the structure of the\nhomologous model at a given time T = T2 , and keeps it\nafterwards.\n\nSubstituting (7.15) into (7.9), we obtain the explicit\nexpressions of the fluxes near the center:\n\u2202M\n\u2202T\n\u2202H\n\u2202T\n\n0.6464\nU0 + 6.329\n0.6464 (U0 + 2)\n= \u2212\nU0 + 6.329\n= \u2212\n\n(7.17)\n\nThe flux of mass is first positive and then decreases; it\nbecomes zero at the time T2 and remains null afterwards.\nThe flux of energy is always negative; its absolute value is\nfirst decreasing; at T2 , it reaches the value of -0.6464, that\nits keeps afterwards (see 5.22a). These results confirm the\nreasoning made in Chapter IV.\nAt the beginning of its life, the cluster is likely not\nvery concentrated; let's assume that U0 has initially the\nlargest value allowed by (7.15), i.e. U0 = \u22126.329. By\nassuming that T = 0 at the initial time, we find\nT2 = 0.4427.\n\n(7.18)\n\nT2 is, in canonical variables, the time needed to form the\ncentral singularity.\n\n\f26\n7.2\n\nM.

By substituting (7.23) into the equations, and dividing by e\u2212sT , we\nobtain a system that is independent of time, but which\ninvolves a new parameter: s.\n7.2.1\n\nMethod of solution\n\nIn practice, instead of writing and solving the system of\nequations of \u2206F and \u2206Q, etc ..., it is easier to keep the\nequations of F, Q, etc ..., to compute a slightly different\n\nmodel from the homologous one by means of these equations, and to obtain the differences by simply computing\nthe differences between the values of the two models. The\ndifferences should not be too large (so that the second order terms are indeed negligible), nor too small (so that\none can get them with a sufficient accuracy); experiment\nled us to fix the amplitude of these differences by setting\n\u2206K = \u22120.001.\n\n(7.24)\n\nTaking into account that the device we use computes\nwith 8 significant digits, we can obtain the differences\nwith a precision of the order of 1/1000.\nHence, the system to solve is as (5.2) and (5.3), as\nsoon as (5.2e) and (5.2f) are replaced with\n( Z\nE\n\n0\n\n=\n\nF1 Q\u20321 dE1\n\nF\n\n(7.25)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n+F\u2032\n\nZ\n\nE\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nF1 Q1 dE1 \u2212 QF(\u22121)\n\n!\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n3\n3\nb \u2212 c FQ\n4\n2\n\u0013Z E\n\u0012\n3\n1\nc\u2212 b\nF1 Q\u20321 dE1\n+\n2\n4\n\u2212\u221e\n)\nZ E\n\u2032\n\u2032\n+s\n[Q1 (F1 \u2212 F0 ) \u2212 F1 (Q1 \u2212 Q0 )] dE1\n\n+\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n0\n\n=\n\n(3\u03bb + 1)b + (2 \u2212 2\u03bb)c\n\u0013\n\u0012\nMe \u2212 Me0\nRe \u2212 Re0\n\u2212\u03bb\n+4s\nRe0\nMe0\n\n(7.26)\n\nand when (7.24) is added.\nThe method of solution is an extension of the one used\nfor the homologous model (Chapter V):\n1. choose a value for s;\n2. choose a temporary form for the function F that satisfies (5.3a) and (5.3c), with K set by (7.21) and\n(7.24);\n3. compute D, Z, R, Q;\n4. adopt temporary value for b and c, and integrate\n(7.25);\n5. re-do after changing b and c, until the final conditions\n(5.3a) and (5.3b) are fulfilled;\n6. go back to point 3 with the new function F;\n7. when two consecutive approximations of F are equal:\ncompute the right-hand side term of (7.26).

These differences are the most interesting in practice, because they\nare those which decay the slowest. The other differences\nwill be treated in a more approximate way later in this\nChapter.\n7.2.2\n\nResults: first proper difference\n\nWe find that the smallest proper value is:\ns = 1.81.\n\n(7.27)\n\nThe differences \u2206F, \u2206D, \u2206R, \u2206Q, \u2206DP of the four\nfundamental functions and the projected density are given\nin Table 4.

(As for its amplitude, the sign of \u2206K is arbitrary;\nwe could have chosen a negative \u2206K; in this case, the difference with the homologous model would have been in\nthe opposite sense.) We see that the difference mostly\naffects the external regions of the cluster: the first proper\ndifference mainly consists in a variation of the external\nradius of the cluster. The structure of the internal region\ndiffers little; the total mass and kinetic energy vary much\nless than the radius, as shown by the values (7.28).\nThis is naturally explained by the fact that the perturbations between the stars are more efficient in the center\nof the cluster, where the density is higher; as a consequence this region becomes close to the final state, represented by the homologous model, earlier.\n7.2.3\n\nResults: second proper difference\n\nThe second proper value is:\ns = 5.12.\n\n(7.29)\n\nWe only give the differences of the parameters:\n\u2206c\n\u2206b\n= +1.71\n= +6.90,\n(7.30)\n\u2206K\n\u2206K\n\u2206Me\n\u2206Le\n\u2206Re\n= \u22123.48\n= \u22120.760\n= +0.182.\n\u2206K\n\u2206K\n\u2206K\nThe profile of the projected density (not shown here)\nshows that the second proper difference, like the first one,\nmostly consists in a variation of the external radius.\n\nFigure 13: Usual homologous model (\u2206K = 0) and homologous\nmodel modified by the first proper difference (\u2206K = 0.2).\n\n7.3\n\nStability of the homologous model\n\nUp to now, we have implicitly assumed that the clusters\nnaturally tend toward the homologous model. For this to\nbe true, the model has to be stable, i.e. any difference\nwith respect to this model is decreasing. On the other\nhand, the stability of the homologous model, if demonstrated, will be, if not a rigorous proof, at least a very\nstrong clue that the model is indeed the final state toward which all clusters tend.\nFor the homologous model to be stable, it is necessary\nand sufficient that all the proper values s yield a positive\nreal part. Thus, we are going to study the complete family of the proper values s, thanks to a very approximate\ncalculation, yet sufficient for the goal we seek.\nWe first assume that the central expansion (4.34) of F\nis valid up to E = \u22121. (This approximation, as all which\nwill follow, has been suggested and checked by the exact\ncomputation of the first two proper functions.) Hence,\nfor E = \u22121, we have:\n\u2206F\n(\u22121) =\n\u2206K\n\u2032\n\u2206F\n(\u22121) =\n\u2206K\n\ne1/2 ,\n\n(7.31)\n\n1\n\u2212 e1/2 .\n2\n\nBetween E = \u22121 and E = 0, we consider the exact equation (7.25). By calculating the derivative of this\nequation, neglecting the terms in F(\u22121) and F2 (because\nF vanishes at the boundary), replacing (7.19) etc ..., and\nsubtracting the equation of the homologous model, we\n\n\f28\n\nM.

The cluster\ndisappears after a time T1 given in (5.13):\n1\n2.452\n.\n=\n\u03b30 c\n\u03b30\n\nWe immediately see that the formation of the central singularity is relatively rapid: it ends at the time T2 ,\ncomputed from (7.18) and (5.12):\nT2 =\n\n0.4051\n\u03b30\n\n(7.45)\n\nand thus occurs for only the first sixth of the lifetime of\nthe cluster.\nFinally, the decrease of the proper differences will also\nbe represented as variations of the mass differences. In\nhomologous variables, we have, from (7.23),\n\u2206Me\n= e\u2212sT ,\n\u2206Me0\n\n(7.46)\n\nand we switch back to non-homologous variables by\nmeans of (5.12) and (5.15), which gives\n\n2. the formation of the central singularity;\n\nT1 =\n\nFigure 14: Compared evolutions: EH = homologous evolution\n[T.N.: \u00e9volution homologique]; EP1 = first proper difference; EP2\n= second proper difference [T.N.: \u00e9cart propre]; C = formation of\nthe central singularity.\n\n(7.44)\n\nThe formation of the central singularity can be seen\nas the variation of \u2206M , difference in mass with respect to\nthe homologous model. This variation is given in (7.7a)\nand (7.16), in homologous variables; we switch to nonhomologous variables by means of (5.12) and (5.15). The\nresulting curve is plotted in Figure 14 (for all the curves of\nthis figure, the mass or the mass difference is normalized\nwith respect to its own value at T = 0).\n\n\u2206Me\n=\n\u2206Me0\n\n\u00131+s/c\n\u0012\nT\n1\u2212\n.\nT1\n\n(7.47)\n\nThis variation is plotted in Figure 14, for the first two\nproper differences. We see once more, that the decrease\nof the differences is rapid with respect to the homologous\nevolution.\nIn reality, the three evolutionary phenomena overlap.\nThe initial amplitude of the differences with respect to the\nhomologous model cannot be determined in the framework of this theory; it could only be found thanks to a\ndetailed study of the formation and the initial phases of\nthe evolution (see Chapter IX). However, there is no reason for the initial state of the cluster to already be close\nto the homologous model, and thus the initial differences\nin the various quantities are likely of the same order of\nmagnitude as the quantities themselves. Therefore, we\ncan suppose that the curves of Figure 14, normalized to\n\n\fOn the dynamical evolution of globular clusters\n\n31\n\nunity for T = 0, roughly represent the relative importance\nof the various effects.\nThe evolution of a cluster can be describe in a broad\noutline as follows: the central density first increases,\nfaster and faster; simultaneously, the differences with respect to the homologous model decrease everywhere in the\ncluster. After a time T1 /6, the central density has became\ninfinite; the remaining difference is practically limited to\nthe first proper difference; the cluster has only lost 1/6\nof its mass, through escapes. Then, the first proper difference continues to decrease; after a time T1 /3, it has\nalmost vanished; the cluster takes the form of the homologous model and keeps it until it disappears, at the time\nT1 .\nWe will see in the next Chapter how these results can\nbe used to estimate the age of globular clusters.\n8\n\nAPPLICATION\nTERS\n\nTO\n\nGLOBULAR\n\nCLUS-\n\nWe are going to compare the theoretical results from the\nprevious Chapters to observational data of globular clusters. The first goal of this comparison is to check that the\ntheory is compatible with the facts (but this would not\nbe a proof of the correctness of the theory, for the reasons detailed in Chapter I); the comparison will give us\ninformation that is out of reach of the direct observation,\nin particular about the mass-luminosity relation and the\nage of the clusters.\n8.1\n\nArtificial cluster\n\nIn order to get a concrete picture of the theoretical model,\nan \"artificial cluster\" has been built by calculating the\nspacial coordinates of the stars, from a table of random\nnumbers, so that it reproduces the density law of the homologous model. More precisely, let n1 , n2 , n3 be three\nrandom number, taken between 0 and 1, with an uniform\nprobability density function; the spherical coordinates R,\n\u03b8, \u03c6 of the star are computed by means of\nMR\n\n=\n\ncos \u03b8 =\n\u03c6 =\n\nn1 M e ,\n\n(8.1)\n\n2n2 \u2212 1,\n2\u03c0n3 .\n\nFigure 15 plots the two-dimensional projection of the\ncluster obtained. The number of stars is 1320. The figure\ncovers only a fraction of the surface of the cluster (see\nthe scale at the bottom of the figure), but, however, contains all the stars; this is because the projected density is\nextremely small in the external regions.\nFigure 16 is a zoom-in on the central region of the\ncluster.\nGlobally, this artificial cluster resembles well the real\nclusters; the similarity would not be perfect because the\nartificial cluster of Figure 15 corresponds to the case of\nequal masses, while the real clusters yields an extended\nmass spectrum, of which we only observed the upper end.\n\nFigure 17: Spacial density of the cluster M3, from Kholopov (top)\nand Oort & van Herk (bottom). The curves are vertically shifted.\n\nThe central condensation in Figure 16 is likely to be too\nhigh (King 1961a).\n8.2\n\nComparisons of the projected densities\n\nA more precise comparison of the homologous model with\nreal clusters can be obtained when plotting the density\nprofiles. It seems better to do the comparison for the\nprojected densities, and not the spacial densities. Indeed,\nthe theoretical curves can be obtained with an arbitrary\naccuracy and going from the theoretical spacial density\nto the theoretical projected density is errorless; on the\ncontrary, going from the observed projected density to\nthe spacial density strongly amplifies the errors, that were\nalready not negligible. This is shown in Figure 17 where\nthe spacial density of the cluster M3, derived from the\nobservations thanks to two different methods (Kholopov\n1955; Oort & van Herk 1959) is plotted.\nGenerally, it seems better to transform the observational data as little as possible, therefore to compare theory and observations not at an intermediate level, but\nrather at the very level of the observations.\nWe shall use, not the projected density itself, but its\nproduct with the distance to the center: \u03c1P r. This has\nseveral advantages:\n1. in the theoretical model (case of equal mass stars),\nthis quantity tends to a finite value in the center,\nwhile the projected density becomes infinite.\n2. \u03c1P r varies more slowly than the projected density\n(recall Figure 5 and Figure 9);\n3. the observations are often counts of stars in concentric rings of constant width.

These counts corresponds to the stars brighter than a given magnitude,\nand situated in concentric rings. It would be necessary,\nin principle, to derive the numbers of stars in successive magnitude ranges by subtraction; however, attempts\nshowed that this strongly increases the spreading of the\npoints, because the errors accumulate, while the number\ndecreases. Furthermore, because the luminosity function\nrapidly grows with the magnitude (see Sandage 1957a),\nthe stars brighter than a given magnitude are almost all\ngathered in a small range of magnitude, and thus all have\nsimilar masses (we assume a well-defined mass-luminosity\nrelation). It is therefore better and allowed to accept that\nthe observed numbers correspond, for each limit in magnitude, to stars of a given mass.\nThat is, the points on Figure 18 mark the observed\nnumbers of stars brighter than a given magnitude MV ,\nin rings of width 30\" situated at the mean distance r\nfrom the center. These numbers must be compared to\nthe theoretical curves obtained in Chapter VI (Figure 9).\nBy trial and error, we find that the best match is obtained\nfor\n1\u2032 \u223c 0.21 canonical units.\n(8.5)\nWe note that this gives out an external radius\nre = 4.703 canonical units \u223c 22.4\u2032 \u223c 79 pc.\n\n(8.6)\n\nFor each group, the curve is fitted, by playing with two\nparameters: the relative mass \u03bc, and factor C, i.e. the\nnumber of stars in the group; a variation of C corresponds\nsimply to a vertical shift of the curve.\nThe values of \u03bc and C determined this way are given\nin Table 5, columns 4 and 5. The curves are plotted in\nFigure 18; we see that the agreement is as good as possible, given the accuracy of the observations. Only the\nbrightest stars are not well-retrieved near the center of\nthe cluster, which can easily be explained by two reasons:\n(1) we have seen in Chapter VI that the simplified theoretical model is likely to be wrong near the center, where\nit predicts a too high density of massive stars; (2) the observation underestimates the number of stars in the very\npopulated central regions.\n\nFigure 20: Mass-luminosity relation in M3, from the spacial distribution of the stars (dots) and from the theory of stellar evolution\n(line).\n\n8.2.2\n\nMass-luminosity relation of the stars\n\nTable 5, column 3, gives the mean absolute magnitude\nMV of each group, computed from the luminosity function (Sandage 1957a). We notice that the difference between this mean magnitude and the maximum magnitude\nis never big, which confirms what has been said above.\nThe values of \u03bc and MV allow us to plot the massluminosity relation of the cluster (Figure 20); \u03bc is proportional to the mass m of the stars, according to (6.32). The\nbolometric correction has been uniformly taken equal to 0.1. In order to extend the relation as much as possible for\nthe faintest stars, we made an exception and considered\nthe group of stars whose magnitude is between 4.6 and 6.3\n(in the case of the narrower group 5.4 < MV < 6.3, the\ndispersion of the points is too large and we cannot plot a\ncurve). This group is compared to the closest theoretical\ncurve in Figure 19; the parameters are given in the last\nrow of Table 5.\nThe points in Figure 20 show a well-defined relation8 .\nWe observe a strong bend at MV = 3, which corresponds\nexactly to the bend in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram,\nand which marks the beginning of the zone of rapid evolution of the stars; the stars with a magnitude below 3\n8 von Hoerner (1957, Figure 8) has obtained a similar curve, from\nthe same observations, but with a different theoretical model. Our\nresults indicate a larger variation of the mass as a function of the\nluminosity.\n\n\fOn the dynamical evolution of globular clusters\n\n35\n\nFigure 18: M3: comparison between observations (points) and theory (lines).

The slight increase of the\npoints on the left-hand side is likely not real and comes\nfrom errors when computing \u03bc.\nIt is interesting to compare this mass-luminosity relation, deduced from the purely mechanical considerations,\nto those provided by the stellar evolution theory. Sandage\n(1957b, Table 6) has computed the relation between the\npresent-day magnitude and the initial magnitude of the\nstars of M3, thanks to a semi-empirical method based on\nthe observed HR diagram and on the theoretical evolutionary tracks. We get the mass from the initial magnitude, assuming that the initial mass-luminosity relation\nis that of the main sequence, i.e.\nL\n=\nL\u2299\n\n\u0012\n\nm\nM\u2299\n\n\u00134\n\nfind that\n\nm2\n= 0.80 M\u2299 .\n(8.8)\nm\nThis value can also be computed from the mass spectrum of the cluster. From the initial luminosity function\n\u03c8(MV ) given by Sandage (1957a, Table 2 and Figure 2)\nand the mass-luminosity relation of Kuiper (1942), we\nobtain the initial mass spectrum. The present-day spectrum is derived by assuming that all the stars heavier than\n1.44 M\u2299 have been evolving down to this value through\ntheir transformation into white dwarves. The effect of\nescape can be neglected. We find\nm\n\n.\n\n(8.7)\n\nThis way, we get the present-day mass-luminosity relation, the solid line on Figure 20; the two relations\nhave been vertically shifted so that their horizontal parts\nmatch.\nThe two curves are clearly in disagreement. The position of the bend is more or less the same; but on the low\nluminosities end, the \"dynamical\" masses decrease much\nfaster than the mass found from the evolution.\nIt is hard to tell which curve is wrong. Neither is very\nreliable. The finding of the dynamical masses relies on an\napproximate calculation (Chapter VI), which may lead to\nlarge errors when (as is the case for globular clusters) the\nmass spectrum is very broad. On the other hand, the hypothesis stating that the initial mass-luminosity relation\nof the cluster would match the main sequence, should be\ntaken carefully, because of different chemical abundances.\nWe will explore the possibilities of progress in the computation of the dynamical masses in the last Chapter.\nThe adjustment of the vertical scales gives an interesting piece of information: when compared to (6.32), we\n\n=\n\n0.353 M\u2299 ,\n\nm2 =\n2\nm /m =\n\n0.265 M\u2299 ,\n0.75 M\u2299 ,\n\n(8.9)\n\nin very good agreement with the value (8.8).\nThis previous finding is quite sensitive to the mass\nchosen for the white dwarves, mb [T.N.: The subscript b\nstands for naine blanche: white dwarf.]. For mb = 1 M\u2299 ,\nwe find m2 /m = 0.61 M\u2299 ; for mb = 2 M\u2299 , we find\nm2 /m = 0.98 M\u2299 . The comparison of the two findings\nseems to confirm that the white dwarves have the limit\nmass of Chandrasekhar, mb = 1.44 M\u2299 . However, here\nagain, the uncertainties of the theory and of the determination of the mass spectrum question the validity of this\nconclusion.\n8.2.3\n\nProjected\n(47 Tuc)\n\ndensity:\n\nbrightness\n\nmeasurements\n\nGascoigne & Burr (1956) have obtained the curves of projected density of the clusters 47 Tucanae and \u03c9 Centauri\nfrom a photometric method. The disadvantage of this\nprocedure is to provide only the total brightness, without\ndistinguishing the stars of different magnitudes; however,\n\n\fOn the dynamical evolution of globular clusters\n\n37\n\n\u03c1P r tends toward a well-defined central value. This seems\nto be a good confirmation of the shape predicted by the\ntheory near the center, and in particular of the fact that\nthe central density is infinite9\n8.3\n\nFigure 21: 47 Tuc: comparison between observations (dots) and\ntheory (line).\n\nit allows for a precise measurement of the density from\nthe center of the cluster up to quite remote distance.\nThe case of \u03c9 Centauri will be studied later. Figure 21\nplots the observed values for 47 Tuc = NGC 104 and the\nclosest theoretical curve, which corresponds to:\n1\u2032\n\n=\n\n0.088 canonical units,\n\n\u03bc\nC\n\n=\n=\n\n1.33,\n0.555 stars of the tenth magnitude per minute.\n\n(8.10)\n\nThe external radius is then:\nre = 53.4\u2032 .\n\n(8.11)\n\nThe value of \u03bc found here can been seen as a particular \"mean mass\", obtained by weighting the stars proportionally to their luminosity. It is only slightly lighter\nthan the mass of the heaviest stars (\u03bc \u2243 1.45 from the\nresults obtained for M3) which contribute to the major\npart of the total brightness.\nFigure 21 shows good agreement (the small systematic\ndeviations of the points from the theoretical curve can be\nexplained: the data of Gascoigne & Burr does not directly\ncome from observations, but has rather been read on a\nsmoothed curve). Near the center, the theoretical curve\nis too high, for reasons already listed in relation to M3.\nGascoigne & Burr have measured the total luminosity\nin a series of circles of small radius around the center of\nthe cluster. For each circle, we can compute the mean\nvalue of \u03c1P r, by using (8.3), with r1 = 0; the crosses on\nFigure 21 mark the value obtained. We clearly see that\n\nMass-radius relation\n\nThe relation (3.7) links the mass of a cluster with its radius and the mean value of the negative curvature of the\ngalactic field along its orbit. Unfortunately, the exact motions of the globular clusters in the Galaxy are unknown;\nthe radial velocities can be measured with a good precision (Mayall 1946; Kinman 1959), but the proper motions\nstand at the limit of the observational possibilities, and\nhave been obtained for 9 clusters only (Gamalej 1948),\nwith a low precision. It seems even not possible to know\nwether the orbits of the clusters are in average rather radial or circular (von Hoerner 1955; Kurth 1960). That is\nwhy we will consider the curvature of the galactic field\nto be the same for all the clusters, for want of anything\nbetter.\nThe radius and the mass of the globular clusters\nshould be linked, at least approximately, through a relation like (3.8). We are going to check this using observational data. To limit the effect of observational errors,\nwe will only use a series of homogeneous observations,\ndone by the same author, under the same circumstances.\nThe distances have been taken from Kinman (1958).\nIn order of preference, we take the distances derived from\nthe position of the main sequence, from the magnitude\nof the variable stars, or from the magnitude of the 25\nbrightest stars. If none of these three estimates exists,\nthe cluster is not considered.\nChristie (1940) made very precise measurements of\nthe apparent magnitudes of the clusters. From them, we\nderive the absolute photographic magnitudes Mpg ; the\npossible effect of absorption is cancelled, because the distances themselves are derived from the apparent magnitudes of the stars.\nThen, we assume that the ratio of the total mass to the\ntotal luminosity is the same for all the globular clusters;\nby taking the mass estimate of M3 by Sandage (1957a) as\nreference, we find that the mass Me of a cluster is given\nas a function of its absolute magnitude Mpg by\nlog Me = \u22120.4 Mpg + 2.00.\n\n(8.12)\n\nThis is confirmed by the study of Zeliakh (1957) who,\nafter a detailed discussion on several clusters, arrived at a\nquite similar value for the constant: 1.94 instead of 2.00.\nFinally, we take the apparent external radii measured\nby Shapley & Sayer (1935); they appeared to be more\nprecise that those published more recently by Mowbray\n(1946). To derive the real radii, we should, in principle,\nuse the distances corrected for absorption. However, as\n9 However, King (1961b) has observed the central region of several clusters in detail and concluded that a high but finite central\ndensity exists.\n\n\f38\n\nM.

Therefore, we can completely neglect the possible existence of absorption. For that matter, this is very fortunate because the absorption is not\nquite well known.\nTable 6 gives the list of the 35 clusters for which\nthe three measurements exist, with their mass (in solar\nmasses), and their radius (in parsecs). The mass-radius\ndiagram is plotted in Figure 22: we see that, despite the\ndispersion of the points, a defined relation arises. The\nmain source of error comes from the estimation of the\nexternal radius, which is difficult to observe precisely;\nthis error alone is enough to explain the dispersion of\nthe points, and it is even remarkable that it does not induce a larger dispersion. (This shows the quality of the\nmeasurements of Shapley & Sayer; if one uses the radii\nfrom Mowbray 1946, the dispersion is much larger.)\nIn addition, the small dispersion justifies the hypothesis of constant curvature of the galactic field for all the\nclusters.\nThe largest error being on re , we shall compute the\n\nFigure 22: Mass-radius relation of the globular clusters.\n\nmeans in the horizontal direction. This way, we find that\nthe data points are well fitted with the relation\nlog (re ) =\n\n1\nlog (Me ) \u2212 0.17 (\u00b10.11).\n3\n\n(8.13)\n\ni.e.,\nMe\n= 3.2 M\u2299 /pc3 ,\nre3\n\n(8.14)\n\nin agreement with the theoretical formula (3.8).\nThe isolated point in the bottom-left corner of the figure is NGC 4147. This cluster is easily distinguishable\nfrom the others; Shapley & Sayer qualify it as \"abnormal\". The point on the top-right corner is \u03c9 Cen, also\nabnormal, as we will see later.\n8.3.1\n\nCorrection of the external radii\n\nThe observed external radius is, in fact, systematically\nsmaller than the real radius. Indeed, the projected density decreases very rapidly toward the outskirts and becomes very small long before reaching the boundary of\nthe cluster. This clearly appears in the artificial cluster\nof Figure 15: a direct estimate of the radius of this cluster, from its aspect, gives a value of the order of 0.6 times\nthe real radius, and this without any background effect.\nTable 1 indicates that only 3% of the total mass of the\ncluster is situated (in projection) beyond half of the radius. That is, even without absorption, the radius may\nbe underestimated by a ratio of about 1/2. A good confirmation of this value can be obtained in the case of the\ntwo clusters studied above: for M3 and 47 Tuc, the observed radii are 11' and 28.2', i.e. 0.49 and 0.53 times the\nreal radii derived from the theory and the projected density profiles, and given in (8.6) and (8.11), respectively.\nFurthermore, there is no absorption for these clusters.\n\n\fOn the dynamical evolution of globular clusters\nThus, we will systematically make a correction, assuming that the real radii are twice as large as the observed radii, given by Shapley & Sayer. As a consequence,\nthe relation (8.14) must be replaced with\nMe\n= 0.40 M\u2299 /pc3 .\nre3\n\n(8.15)\n\nThis relation between the mass and the real external radius is plotted in Figure 22 as a dashed line. All the\nobserved radii stand on its left side, as expected.\n8.3.2\n\nCurvature of the galactic field\n\n(5.5). We use the value m2 /m found from the observation\nof M3 (Equation 8.8). The factor ln (n) does not vary\nmuch for the different globular clusters; we use the typical\nvalue n = 105 . Finally, the radius is linked to the mass\nthrough (8.15), found from the observations. Thus, we\nfind the very simple relation:\ndt\n= 1.76 \u00d7 105 Me ,\ndT\n\n\u2202 2 UG\n= (B \u2212 A)(3A + B) = \u22121370 km2 s\u22122 kpc\u22122 .\n\u2202x2\n(8.17)\nThe mean curvature of the galactic field for the globular clusters is thus about 3 times smaller than in the\nsolar neighborhood. This result is plausible, because the\nclusters travel in average at a quite long distance from\nthe center of the Galaxy, and not in its plane. A more\ndetailed comparison of the value (8.16) with the known\nstructure of the Galaxy would be interesting, but is out\nof the scope of this work.\n8.4\n\nEvolution\n\nKnowing the mass Me and the radius re of a real cluster,\nwe can compute the parameters \u03b2 and \u03b3 of the homology, using the transformation relations (6.31b), (6.34a),\n(2.32c), (2.43a).

In particular, we obtain:\nm\n1\ndt\n= G\u22121/2\ndT\nm2 ln (n)\n\n\u0012\n\nMe\nMe\n\n\u00131/2 \u0012\n\nre\nRe\n\n\u00133/2\n\n.\n\n(8.19)\n\nThis relation gives the time scale of the evolution of\nthe cluster, because T is, as we have seen (Chapter V),\na parameter that measures the level of evolution of the\ncluster, while t is the real time. Me and Re are given in\n\n(8.20)\n\nwhere t is in years and Me in solar masses.\n(6.22) provides the escape rate of the stars of given\nmass, which also reads\n1 dnm\n= \u2212\u03b8.\nnm dT\n\nWhen comparing (3.7) and (8.15), we find the mean curvature of the galactic field for the clusters:\n\u2202 2 UG\n= \u22125.4 \u00d7 10\u221216 yr\u22122 = \u2212520 km2 s\u22122 kpc\u22122 .\n\u2202x2\n(8.16)\nFor comparison, we can compute the curvature in the\nsolar neighborhood; it derives from the Oort's constants A\nand B (the numerical values are taken from Allen 1955):\n\n39\n\n(8.21)\n\nRecall that nm is the number of stars whose mass is between m and m + dm. \u03b8 is given in Table 2 and can be\nfitted with the relation:\n\u03b8 \u2243 0.4078 (3 \u2212 2\u03bc).\n\n(8.22)\n\nThen, we can compute the variation of the total mass,\nby using (6.25b), (6.32) and (6.26). We find\ndMe\n= \u22120.4078 Me .\ndT\n\n(8.23)\n\nWe note that this result does not depend on the mass\nfunction.\nWhen comparing with (8.20), the mass Me cancels,\nand we get\ndMe\n= \u22122.3 \u00d7 10\u22126 M\u2299 /yr.\ndt\n\n(8.24)\n\nThus: the mass of a globular cluster decreases by\n2300 M\u2299 per billion years; this rate is almost the same\nfor all the globular clusters, and it also remains constant\nwith time. The simplicity of this result is to be noted.\nIn fact, the rate is not exactly constant. The term\nln (n) changes with time, which would lead to slight slowdown of the evolution near the end. On the other hand,\nthe term m0 = m2 /m increases because the lightest stars\nescape faster. This effect is opposite to the previous one\nand likely stronger. For example, in the cluster M3 which\nis still at the beginning of its evolution, the value observed\nis m0 = 0.80 M\u2299 ; near the end of its evolution (in about\n100 Gyr), only the heaviest stars will remain and we will\nget m0 = 1.44 M\u2299 , thus a multiplication of the evolution\nrate by a factor 1.8.\n8.5\n\nMass function of the globular clusters\n\nThe evolution law of the masses of the globular clusters\npartially sets the present-day mass distribution of these\nmasses. We are going to see whether a confirmation of\n(8.24) can be obtained this way.\nFrom the apparent magnitudes and the apparent distance moduli provided by Lohmann (1952) for 94 clusters,\nwe compute the absolute magnitudes and then the masses\nusing (8.12).\n\n\f40\n\nM. H\u00e9non, translated by F. Renaud\n\nFigure 23: Mass function of the globular clusters, observed (dotted line), corrected for observational selection (solid line), initial\n(dashed line). [T.N.: The upper axis reads t en milliards d'ann\u00e9es:\nt in billion years.]\n\nThe mass function we obtain is plotted in Figure 23,\nusing the dotted line on the left-hand side. The two most\nmassive clusters are off the figure: M2 and \u03c9 Cen of\nmasses 3.4 \u00d7 105 M\u2299 and 5.2 \u00d7 105 M\u2299 . We must also\ninvestigate the effect of observational selection. By looking at the apparent magnitudes mpg of the clusters, we\nsee a clear upper limit at mpg = 12.5; we assume that\nthis value marks the highest observable magnitude. As\na consequence, the clusters of given absolute magnitude\nMpg are observed only if their apparent distance modulus\nis smaller than 12.5 \u2212 Mpg . That is, we can compute, for\neach value of Mpg , the observable fraction of the clusters,\nas soon as we know the distribution of clusters as a function of the apparent modulus. This distribution (that we\nassume to be independent of the absolute magnitude) is\neasily found thanks to the brightest clusters, for which\nobservational selection does not play any role.\nThe solid line in Figure 23 is the corrected mass function. It can be fitted with a smooth curve. In particular,\nwe note that this curve takes a finite value for Me = 0.\nBut if we assume that all the globular clusters formed\nin the past and that no more are born now; and if the\nevolution of the masses is as\ndMe\n\u221d M\u03bde ,\ndt\n\n(8.25)\n\nwe can easily find that the present-day mass function\nmust be proportional to M\u2212\u03bd\nnear the origin [T.N.: i.e.\ne\nfor Me \u2192 0]. Therefore, this mass function must be zero\nfor Me = 0 if \u03bd is negative, and become infinite if \u03bd is\npositive; it can take a finite value only if \u03bd = 0. Therefore,\nthe observed mass function seems to confirm the evolution\nlaw (8.24).\nThe validity of this point is slightly weakened because\n\nit relies on the number of the least massive clusters, that\nare the least well observed; but we can argue that the\ncorrection for observational selection (Figure 23) is not\nvery important; the conclusion would have been the same\nwithout the correction.\nNote also that (8.25) is not fanciful but in fact covers\nall the evolutionary models already studied by several authors. The formulae of Chandrasekhar (1943b,c) assume\n\u03bd = +1; the model from King (1958b) corresponds to\n\u03bd = \u22122.5 and the similar model of von Hoerner (1958) to\n\u03bd = \u22123.55.\nThe evolution formula (8.24) translates into a simple\nshift of the mass function toward the left; or alternatively,\ninto a shift of the zero-mass toward the right. The upper\naxis of Figure 23 indicates the position of this zero-mass\nat different times, past and future. In particular, the\n[T.N.: vertical] dashed line on the left-hand side marks\nthe position of the zero-mass point at the time of birth\nof the clusters, assuming it occurred 25 Gyr ago (see the\nnext Section). By extrapolating the observed curve a little, we obtain the initial mass function. We find that\nabout 62 globular clusters have disappeared since the origin of the galaxy. Nowadays, one cluster disappears every\n500 Myr, in average. Every cluster that has survived has\nlost 57000 M\u2299 as escaping stars since its birth. For all\nthe clusters, the mass of the escapers since their birth is:\n8 \u00d7 106 M\u2299 .\nIn the future side, we find that half of today's clusters\nwill be gone in 30 Gyr; but the most massive ones will\nsurvive much longer: \u03c9 Centauri will reach 230 Gyr.\nUp to now, we have neglected the phenomenon of gas\nejection by the massive stars. von Hoerner (1958) showed\nthat this phenomenon is only relevant at the beginning of\nthe life of the cluster: 30% of the initial mass is lost in\nthe gaseous form within the first billion years, then only\n6% during the next 5 Gyr. The results obtained above\nare therefore valid, as soon as we put aside the initial\nevolutionary phase, lasting about one billion years.\n8.6\n\nAge of the globular clusters\n\nWhen a cluster reaches the homologous state, any sign of\nits past (in particular its initial structure and its age) is\nlost. That is, one should specially care about the clusters\nthat still show significant differences with the homologous\nmodel. According to the theory (see Equation 8.20), the\nmost massive clusters are those which evolve the slowest,\ntherefore, those where the largest differences should remain. That is, we are interested in \u03c9 Centauri, the most\nmassive of all globular clusters.\nBut precisely, \u03c9 Centauri yields a peculiar structure,\nvery different from those of the other clusters. The difference already arises as its concentration class in Shapley's\nclassification is VII, while all the other high luminosity\nclusters lie in classes I to V. The difference is even more\nvisible in the work of Gascoigne & Burr (1956) who observed \u03c9 Cen and 47 Tuc under the same circumstances.\nThe Table II and the Figure 2 from these authors per-\n\n\fOn the dynamical evolution of globular clusters\nfectly show that the light from a small circle of radius r\nsurrounding the center of the cluster is proportional to\nr2 in the case of \u03c9 Cen, and to r for 47 Tuc. In other\nwords: in 47 Tuc, the projected density goes as 1/r near\nthe center; but in \u03c9 Cen, it is almost constant. The central density of \u03c9 Cen is finite.\nThe theoretical interpretation comes immediately:\n47 Tuc has already reached the stage in its evolution\nwhere the central density becomes infinite; \u03c9 Cen, being more massive, has not reached it yet. (It seems to be\nthe only globular cluster in this case.)\nThis confirms the theory, and we now have a simple\nway of estimating the age of the clusters. When comparing (2.32e), (7.44), (7.45) and (8.20), we find that the\ntime required for the infinite central density to appear is\nt2 = 0.713 \u00d7 105 Me0 = 0.854 \u00d7 105 Me2 ,\n\n(8.26)\n\nwhere t2 is in years, Me0 is the initial mass of the cluster\nand Me2 its mass at the time when the infinite central\ndensity appears. The present-day masses of 47 Tuc and\n\u03c9 Cen, obtained as in the previous Section, are: 2.8 \u00d7\n105 M\u2299 and 5.2 \u00d7 105 M\u2299 . We conclude that the age of\nthese clusters (assuming it is the same) must be between\n24 \u00d7 109 yr\n\nand\n\n44 \u00d7 109 yr.\n\n(8.27)\n\nFurthermore, the most recent estimates of the age\nof the globular clusters from the stellar evolution theory\n(Sandage 1961) are\n22 \u00d7 109 yr\n9\n\n26 \u00d7 10 yr\n\nfor M13,\n\n(8.28)\n\nfor M3 and M5.\n\nThat is, two completely independent methods lead to\nvalues in agreement for the age of the globular clusters.\nThis result is very encouraging, both for the theory of the\ndynamical evolution of the clusters and for the theory\nof stellar evolution. It also emphasizes the discrepancy\nunderlined by Sandage (1961) between the ages of the\nglobular clusters and the recent models of an expanding\nUniverse.\nAccording to theory, \u03c9 Cen should have more differences with respect to the homologous model; the first\nproper difference should still exist with a non negligible\namplitude. We have seen (see Figure 13) that this difference affects mostly the external radius. And we precisely\nnote that that the radius of \u03c9 Cen is far too large, given\nits mass (Figure 22).\nFinally, the strong ellipticity of \u03c9 Cen is likely the\nremnant of an initial difference from spherical symmetry,\nthat has not enough time to vanish yet.\n9\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe are going to summarize the major results obtained in\nthis work, and then list the directions in which it would\nbe good to develop the research, in order to improve the\ntheory and extend the range of its applications.\n\n9.1\n\n41\n\nResults obtained\n\nBy making two hypotheses: (1) isotropy of the velocities and (2) equal masses, we have obtained the system\nof equations (2.25), which, supplemented by the right\nboundary conditions, allows us to compute the evolution\nof a cluster from a given initial state. We have looked\nfor an homologous solution, i.e. a model that remains\nself-similar, the evolution being limited to the scaling of\nthe various physical quantities; we have found that this\nmodel exists and is unique. Its mass and its radius are\nfinite. The projected density matches the observations as\nmuch as their precision allows. Near the center, the homologous model yields unexpected properties: the central\ndensity and the central potential are infinite; a continuous flux of negative energy goes toward the center where\nit is absorbed by the formation of multiple stars. Furthermore, the escape of stars through the boundary of\nthe cluster leads to a linear decrease of the total mass\nwith time.\nThen, we have supposed that the main population of\nthe cluster is mixed with a second population, much less\nnumerous, of stars with a different mass, and we have\ncomputed the distribution of this secondary population\nand its escape rate. These results allow for an approximate solution in the case of any mass function. By comparing with the observations, we obtain in particular the\napproximate mass-luminosity relation of the stars in clusters.\nFinally we have studied the evolution of clusters close\nto the homologous model. We found that if the central\ndensity is finite, it rapidly increases and becomes infinite\nafter a certain time. Generally, any difference with the\nhomologous model decreases with time; a cluster becomes\nalmost identical to the homologous model after the first\nthird of its lifetime. In particular, these results lead to an\nestimate of the age of the globular clusters.\n9.2\n\nDesirable improvements and extensions\n\n1. The most debatable hypotheses of the present model\nis indubitably the isotropy of the velocities. We\ncould, as a first step, make the distribution function\nmore general by adding an anisotropic term, small\ncompared to the main term; this would allow us to\nquantify the error made when using the isotropy hypothesis. In a more ambitious second step, we would\neliminate any restriction for the distribution function f (E, A); but in this case, the equation of local evolution would become extremely complex (see\nRosenbluth, MacDonald & Judd 1957, Equation 31).\n2. In the study of the approach to the homologous\nmodel made in Chapter VII, we assume that the\ncluster is already similar enough to the homologous\nmodel that we can linearize the equations of the differences. It would be very interesting to also study\nthe evolution of clusters far from the homologous\nmodel; this would allow us to describe the beginning\n\n\f42\n\nM. H\u00e9non, translated by F. Renaud\nof the evolution of a cluster, from a given initial state.\nTo do so, we would have to come back to the real\n[T.N.: physical] variables and directly solve (2.25),\nby computing step by step the successive forms taken\nby the cluster in time10 . The results could be applied\nto a detailed explanation of the structure of \u03c9 Cen\nand to a precise estimate of its age. They would\nalso allow for a more rigorous demonstration of the\nstatement that clusters tend toward the homologous\nmodel, whatever their initial state is.\n\n3. The previous paragraph implies the knowledge of the\ninitial state of the clusters, therefore the building of\na more or less approximate theory for the formation\nof the clusters and the initial phase during which the\nsteady state is established. We could assume, for\nexample, that the protocluster is an homogeneous\nsphere with a density slightly higher than the critical\ndensity (therefore, favoring a contraction), with negligible internal velocities. The evolution equations for\nthis initial phase would be completely different from\nthose we have considered here; on the one hand, the\nsteady state is not reached and thus the distribution\nfunction does not only depend on E and A, and on\nthe other hand, because this phase is very short, the\neffect of perturbations can be neglected. Fortunately\nthis implies that there is no need for the knowledge\nof the time of formation of the stars.\n4. The hypothesis of equal mass stars is likely to be far\nfrom reality. In Chapter VI, we have obtained a more\ngeneral solution but at the cost of a quite arbitrary\napproximation. Hence, we should extend the investigations to the case of any mass function. But then\na big difficulty appears: the escape rates of the stars\nof different masses not being the same, their relative\nimportance always changes and the structure of the\ncluster varies too; as a consequence a homologous solution cannot exist. In other words, if one introduces\nthe mass as an additional variable, one must also\nconsider the time variable, and the complexity of the\ncalculations is suddenly hugely increased.\nThere are two possibilities to overcome this. First, we\ncould seek a better model than the homologous one,\nthat would allow us to separate the time variable;\nthis model would necessary count, in addition to the\ntwo dimensional parameters, one or more other parameters depending on time. Second, the mass function could be initially described as a sum of [T.N.:\nDirac's] \u03b4 distributions. The simplest case of the sum\nof two \u03b4 distributions (i.e. a cluster made of the mix\nof stars of two different masses, in any proportion),\nwould already be a great improvement and would allow us to estimate the actual effect of a spread of\nmasses.\n10 A similar calculation has been done, in the much simpler\ncase of a homogeneous plasma, by MacDonald, Rosenbluth & Wong\n(1957).\n\n5. We have only considered the value \u03bb = 1/3 of the\npower of the radius-mass relation (3.11), with the\nperspective of globular clusters. The calculations\ncould be re-done with different values of \u03bb, and in\nparticular, with \u03bb = \u221e, which correspond to the\nisolated cluster, and seems to better fit the cases of\ngalaxies and galaxy clusters. The other values of \u03bb\ndo not seem to correspond to existing objects, but\ncould be useful to describe some intermediate states.\n6. The hypothesis of spherical symmetry is valid for\nmost of the clusters; but some are clearly elliptical.\nFurthermore, we could foresee the application of the\nmodels to other objects (see point 8 below). Thus,\nwe should study the non-spherical models. The ellipticity can originate from a global rotation; a first\napproximation would consider that the rotation is\nsmall and only implies a correction term. We would\nlikely find a model similar to the homologous one,\nbut slightly flattened. It would be particularly interesting to find whether the escaping stars take away a\nlittle or a lot of angular momentum, and thus, if the\nflattening increases or decreases.\nWe should also study the case of an angular momentum distribution without spherical symmetry, but\nstill with no global rotation. Such an asymmetry\nwould probably decrease, with a relaxation time of\nthe same order as those found in Chapter VII for the\nradial differences.\nFinally, it would be good to consider the effect of the\nasymmetry in the galactic field (see Chapter III). But\nthis effect is likely not so important for the applications, because it only affects the external regions,\nwhich are invisible because of their very low density\n(King 1961a).\n7. From the observational side, it seems that much remains to be done. Accurate counts per luminosity\nclass, as those made by Sandage for the cluster M3,\nwould be very useful for other clusters. Furthermore,\nerrors could probably be reduced by repeating the\ncounts for several photographs of the same cluster.\n(Tayler 1954 noted big differences between the plates\nobtained with two different telescopes.)\nThe comparisons of accurate observation with a sufficiently elaborated theory would particularly allow\nfor:\n\u2022 a precise physical determination of the massluminosity relation; to push this relation as far\nas possible toward the low luminosities, one\nshould particularly study the closest clusters.\nIn the future, space observatories would allow\nus to reach much higher magnitudes;\n\u2022 an estimate of the age of the clusters, and perhaps information about their formations, when\nanalyzing the differences between the presentday structure of the clusters and their theoretical final structure. However, these differences\n\n\fOn the dynamical evolution of globular clusters\nare small for most of the clusters, so that this\nanalysis would require a high precision for the\nobservations. One should start with the most\nmassive clusters, where the largest differences\nremain;\n\u2022 a study of the galactic field and of the orbits of\nthe globular clusters.\n8. Here, we have only focussed on globular clusters. The\nmodels obtained could be applied to other objects:\ngalactic clusters [T.N.: star clusters in the disk of\nthe galaxy, as opposed to the globulars that are further away in the halo], elliptical galaxies and cores\n[T.N.: central, spherical regions] of spiral galaxies,\ngalaxy clusters. But in every case, difficulties appear,\nmaking the application of the theory more doubtful\nor more complex. That is, we think that the theory should first focus on describing properly the relatively simple case of globular clusters (which it is\nstill far from doing) before extending its ambitions\nto more involved problems.\nThe galactic clusters would be extremely interesting,\nfor many reasons: being closer, less massive stars are\nvisible there; their ages are not all the same and thus\nwe can observe all the phases of the dynamical evolution; and it is possible to measure individual velocities. Unfortunately, there are two major difficulties:\nthe number of stars is small, so that statistical fluctuations forbid an accurate estimate of the projected\ndensity and of the other quantities; and above all,\nas Spitzer (1958) showed, the evolution of the cluster is largely influenced by passages near interstellar\nclouds.\n9. Finally, we note some minor issues: the enhancement\nof the computation of the perturbations between the\nstars; the study of the accumulation of central energy as multiple stars and the final evolution of the\ncluster (see the end of Chapter V); the influence of\nthe motion of the cluster within the galaxy on the escape of stars (this could be simplified as a three-body\nproblem: galactic center, cluster, star).\nOne sees that there is no shortage of work. Stellar\ndynamics is a rising science, where almost everything remains to be done. It looks today much more like a collection of isolated attempts than like a homogeneous doctrine. These attempts have only led to isolated results,\nwith limited range; the major problems, far from being\nsolved, have remained almost untouched.\nAs we have seen, the issues do not arise from a poor\nknowledge of the physical mechanisms involved, but only\nfrom the complexity of the calculations. But today, a new,\nextremely powerful, weapon exists to overcome this kind\nof issues: the electronic computers. That is, we think that\nstellar dynamics should now leave the relative state of neglect where it has been left and spark off the interest and\nthe long-term efforts of a growing number of researchers.\n\n43\n\nIt seems worthless to underline the importance of the results that could be obtained: the understanding of the\ncollective dynamical phenomena is directly linked to the\nsolving of the major cosmogonical and cosmological problems, and thus to our understanding of the Universe. We\nhope that the present essay, although it has a very limited scope, will contribute to the illumination of the new\nperspectives and give to others the wish to explore them.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nMy acknowledgements go to Prof. A.
