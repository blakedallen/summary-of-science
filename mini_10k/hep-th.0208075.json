Yurov\nTheoretical Physics Department,\nKaliningrad State University, Russia, yurov@freemail.ru\nAbstract\nUsing Darboux transformation one can construct infinite family of potentials\nwhich lead to the flat spectrum of scalar field fluctuations with arbitrary multiple\nprecision, and, at the same time, with \"essentially blue\" spectrum of perturbations\nof metric. Besides, we describe reconstruction problem: find classical potential V (\u03c6)\nstarting from the known \"one-loop potential\" u(t) = d2 V (\u03c6(t))/d\u03c6(t)2 .\n\n1\n\nIntroduction.\n\nIn [1] a new mechanism for the generation density perturbation by tachyonic instability\nis discussed. If we assume that\n1. the universe was flat and homogeneous;\n2. Hubble constant is small during the process generation of the perturbation\nthen the equation for the quantum fluctuations \u03b4\u03c6k (t)e\u2212ikr of scalar field is\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n\u03b4 \u03c6\u0308k + k 2 + u(t) \u03b4\u03c6k = 0,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere u(t) = d2 V (\u03c6(t))/d\u03c6(t)2 (we call u(t) as \"one-loop potential\"), V (\u03c6) is classical\npotential, \u03c6(t) is a homogeneous solution of classical equation of motion. To calculate\nspectrum of density\none need to find solution of (1) with the asymptotic behavior \u03b4\u03c6k (t \u2192\n\u221a\n+\u221e) = eikt / 2k. Then density fluctuations at moment t0 are given by\n\u03b4k \u223c H\n\nk\n2\u03c0\n\n!3/2\n\n\u03b4\u03c6k (t0 )\n,\n\u03b4\u03c60(t0 )\n\nns = 1 +\n\nd log | \u03b4k |2\n,\nd log k\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03b4\u03c60 is solution of the (1) with k = 0, ns is the spectral index deciding the \"color\"\nof spectrum. It is easy to see that \u03b4\u03c60 is both k = 0 solution of the (1) and the time\nderivative of the field \u03c6(t): \u03b4\u03c60 (t) = \u03c6\u0307(t) so it's dimensions is [\u03b4\u03c60 ] =GeV2 whereas for\nthe \u03b4\u03c6k (t) we choose the normalization factor to have [\u03b4\u03c6k ] =GeV1/2 (in the units with\nc = h\u0304 = 1).\nThere are just two usually studied potentials: power-law potential V (\u03c6) = \u2212\u03bb\u03c6n /M n\u22124 ,\n(M is the some constant, \u03bb > 0 1 ) and \"ekpyrotic\" or \"cyclic\" potential V (\u03c6) = \u2212V0 e\u2212\u03c6/M\n1\n\nThe potential V (\u03c6) < 0 so one needs to add to V (\u03c6) some other terms to stabilize the motion. But\nit doesn't matter in this paper which is devoted to tachyonic instability.\n\n\f[2, 3]. Both of them leads to the equation (1) with u(t) = \u2212\u03bc2 /t2 . For the power-law potentials \u03bc2 = \u03bc2 (n) = 2n(n\u22121)/(n\u22122)2 and it easy to see that all quantities \u03bc2 (n) > 0 can\nbe obtained by appropriate choosing of n. For example, if n > 2 then \u03bc2 (n) \u2208 (2, +\u221e);\nif n \u2208 [1, 4/3] then \u03bc2 (n) \u2208 [0, 2] and for the n \u2208 (\u2212\u221e, 0] we have \u03bc2 (n) \u2208 [0, 2). For the\n\"cyclic\" potential \u03bc2 = 2.\nIn these both cases the equation (1) can be solved via Hankel function. The aim of this\nwork to call attention to simple but effective method to construct infinite set of one-loop\npotentials with two properties:\n1. All this one-loop potentials are integrable. This allow one to find \u03b4\u03c6k and \u03b4\u03c60 exactly to calculate \u03b4k .\n2. These one-loop potentials lead to almost flat spectrum.\n\nAlthough, our approach get us a family \"one-loop\" potentials u(t) one can reconstruct\ninitial classical potential V (\u03c6) starting out from the u(t). We do it in the Sec. 3. In this\nnext we also discuss the compatibility one of new potential with inflation. One show that\nthis potential can lead to inflation but for very specific initial condition. This fact is at\none with analysis in [1].\nOur results about the flat spectrum are valid only for the spectrum of the scalar field\nand, to all appearances, don't valid for the spectrum of density perturbations. In Sec. 4,\nwe show that using Darboux transformations, one can construct infinite set exact soluble\ncosmologies with flat spectrum of the scalar field perturbations and, at the same time,\nwith \"essentially nonflat\", blue spectrum of perturbations of metric.\n\n2\n\nFlat spectrum via Darboux transformation.\n\nLet consider the equations\n\u03b4 \u03c6\u0308k + (k 2 + u(t))\u03b4\u03c6k = \u03b4 \u03c8\u0308\u03ba + (\u2212\u03ba2 + u(t))\u03b4\u03c8\u03ba = 0,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere u(t) = \u22122/t2 , k and \u03ba are real numbers. One choose the solution of the first\nequation (3) as (t > 0).\n\u0012\n\u0013\ni\n\u03b4\u03c6k = N 1 +\neikt .\nkt\nThis is the particular case of the Hankel functions [1]. To calculate spectrum one need\nto choose the normalization factor N = (2k)\u22121/2 . It is shown in [1] that in this case the\nspectrum of density fluctuations will be exactly flat, ns = 1. It's clear that \u03b4\u03c60 has the\nform\nc\u2212\n(4)\n\u03b4\u03c60 = c+ t2 + ,\nt\nc\u00b1 are constants of integration.\nThe general solution of the second equation from (3) is\n\u03b4\u03c8\u03ba = C+\n\n\u0012\n\n1\n1\ne\u03bat + C\u2212 1 +\ne\u2212\u03bat ,\n1\u2212\n\u03bat\n\u03bat\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n(5)\n\n\fwith some constants C\u00b1 . We introduce the Darboux transformation for the (3) as\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\n\u03b4\u03c6k (t) \u2192 \u03b4\u03c6k (t; \u03ba) \u2261 \u03b4\u03c6k =\n\n\u03b4 \u03c6 \u0307k \u03b4\u03c8\u03ba \u2212 \u03b4\u03c6k \u03b4 \u03c8 \u0307\u03ba\n,\n\u03b4\u03c8\u03ba\n\nu(t) \u2192 u(1) (t; \u03ba) \u2261 u(1) = u + 2\n\n(6)\n\n2\n\nd log \u03b4\u03c8\u03ba\n.\ndt2\n\n(1)\n\nIt's easy to see that new function \u03b4\u03c6k is solution of \"dressed\" equation\n(1)\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\n(1)\n\n\u03b4 \u03c6\u0308k + k 2 + u(1) \u03b4\u03c6k = 0,\n\n(7)\n\nif \u03b4\u03c6k and \u03b4\u03c8\u03ba are solutions of the (3). We call \u03b4\u03c8\u03ba as prop function. We can choose\nthe prop function as any solution of the equation (3), for example as \u03b4\u03c6k\u0303 with k\u0303 6= k, or\nas \u03b4\u03c60 , but it is useful to choose one as (5). In this case new (integrable 2 ) potential u(1)\nhas the form,\nA2 e2\u03bat + B 2 e\u22122\u03bat \u2212 4AB(\u03bat)2 \u2212 2AB\nu(1) = \u22122\u03ba2\n,\n(8)\n(A(\u03bat \u2212 1)e\u03bat + B(\u03bat + 1)e\u2212\u03bat )2\n\nso when t \u2192 +\u221e then\n\n2\n4\n\u2212\n\u2192 u(t).\nt2 \u03bat3\nIt mean that for the enough large t0 , u(1) (t0 ) \u223c u(t0 ) and therefore, the spectrum of\nfluctuations at this moment is the same both u(t0 ) and u(1) (t0 ).\n\u221a\n2k,\nTo show this we choose the normalization factor of initial \u03b4\u03c6k as N = 1/(ik \u2212\n\u03ba)\n\u221a\n(1)\n(1)\nikt\nto obtain the good asymptotic behavior for the \u03b4\u03c6k : \u03b4\u03c6k (t \u2192 +\u221e; \u03ba) = e / 2k. We\nsuppose that\n0 < kt0 \u226a 1 \u226a \u03bat0 ,\n(9)\nu(1) \u2192 \u2212\n\nso we are interesting of long wavelength fluctuations with wavelength \u03bb \u223c 1/k \u226b 1/\u03ba, at\nthe moment 1/\u03ba \u226a t0 \u226a 1/k.\nUsing (6), (9) we get\n2\n(1)\n\u03b4\u03c6k (t0 ; \u03ba)\n(1)\n\n!\n\nk\n1\n2\n\u223c\n2+\n+\n.\n2\n2\n4\n2 (k + \u03ba )\n(kt0 )\n(kt0 )3\n(1)\n\n(1)\n\nTo obtain \u03b4k one need to substitute \u03b4\u03c6k (t0 ; \u03ba) and \u03b4\u03c60 (t0 ; \u03ba) into the (2). The\n(1)\nfunction \u03b4\u03c60 (t0 ; \u03ba) can be obtained from the (6) by the substitution \u03b4\u03c6k \u2192 \u03b4\u03c60 from the\n(1)\n(1)\n(4). The only k dependence is in the \u03b4\u03c6k (t0 ; \u03ba), so we omit the calculation of \u03b4\u03c60 (t0 ; \u03ba).\n(1)\nIt's clear that in main order (\u03ba \u226b k, kt0 \u226a 1) the amplitude | \u03b4k | does not depend on\nk, so we get a flat spectrum. As in the [1], we obtain this result without any brane-string\nphysics.\nTo consider small deviation from flat spectrum we write\n1\n(1)\n| \u03b4\u03c6k |\u223c \u221a 2 3/2 (1 + kt0 ) .\n\u03ba 2t0 k\n2\n\nThis is because one can obtain all solutions of the (7) starting out from the known solutions of the eq.\n(3). This why Darboux transformation is power tool to construct many, if not all, exact soluble potential\nin one dimensional quantum mechanics [5].\n\n\fUsing (2) we get\n\uf8eb\n\nk\n\n(1)\n\n\uf8f6\n\nd | \u03b4\u03c6k (t0 ) | \uf8f8\n= 1 \u2212 kt0 ,\nns = 2 \uf8ed2 +\n(1)\ndk\n| \u03b4\u03c6k (t0 ) |\nso if kt0 \u2192 0 then ns \u2192 1 and ns < 1.

In a case of general position, these\npotentials can be obtained in parametric form only. Let consider (14). If C+ < 0 and\nC\u2212 < 0 then function \u03c6(t) is monotone decreasing function and V (\u03c6) is single-valued\nfunction on \u03c6 with maximum in\nV\u2212 (\u03c6) = \u03c1 \u2212\n\n| C\u2212 |\n\u03c6\u2217 = \u03c60 \u2212\n3\n\n!\n\n| C\u2212 |\n1\n,\n+ log\n2\n2 | C+ |\n\n9\nV (\u03c6\u2217 ) = \u03c1 \u2212\n2\n\n| C+ | C\u22122\n4\n\n!2/3\n\n.\n\n\fThis decreasing potential has asymptotic behavior\nV (\u03c6) \u2192 \u2212\nand\n\nC\u22122 2\u03c6/|C\u2212 |\ne\n,\n2\n\nas\n\n\u03c6 \u2192 +\u221e\n\n(t \u2192 0),\n\n2/3\n\nC\nV (\u03c6) \u2192 \u2212 + (3\u03c6)4/3 ,\nas\n\u03c6 \u2192 \u2212\u221e\n(t \u2192 +\u221e).\n2\nIf, C+ C\u2212 < 0 then the function \u03c6(t) has one extreme point and V (\u03c6) is two-digit function\non \u03c6.\nUsing this method one can reconstruct the classical potential V (\u03c6) starting out with\nthe \"one-loop potential\" u(1) (8). Dressing \u03b4\u03c60 (4) and choosing C+ = C\u2212 = 1, c\u2212 = 0\nwe get\n\u0011\n\u0010\n2\n2\n2 (1)\n2\u03ba\nsinh\ny\n\u2212\ny\nd\nV\n(\u03c6)\nu(1) (y) =\n=\u2212\n,\nd\u03c62\n(y cosh y \u2212 sinh y)2\n(19)\n2\ny (\u22123y cosh y + (3 + y ) sinh y)\n,\ny = \u03bat,\n\u03b7(y) =\ny cosh y \u2212 sinh y\nso using (12) one get the potential V (\u03c6) in parametric form. It easy to see that\n1\nV (\u03c6) \u223c \u2212 (3\u03ba\u03c6)4/3 ,\n2\nand\n\nas\n\n4\nV (\u03c6) \u223c \u03c1 \u2212 \u221a (\u03ba(\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c60 ))3/2 ,\n5\n\nt \u2192 +\u221e,\nas\n\nt \u2192 0,\n\ntherefore \u03c1 is initial value of V (\u03c6). Then dV /d\u03c6 = 2\u03ba\u03b7\u0307 6= 0, so V (\u03c6) is monotone function\non \u03c6. And last but not least, \u03b4\u03c60 is monotone function on time therefore V (\u03c6) is singlevalued function on \u03c6.\nChoosing another c\u00b1 one can find a family of classical potentials with the same quantum potentials V \u2032\u2032 and which lead to the same spectrum.\nIt is interesting to consider the last potential (which can be obtained from the (19))\nfrom the inflation standpoint. To obtain inflation one suppose that \u03c6\u03072 /2 \u226a| V (\u03c6) |\nso \u03c1 \u226b \u03b7 2 /2 and during inflation V (\u03c6) \u223c \u03c1 (we suppose \u03c1 > 0). Therefore H 2 =\n8\u03c0\u03c1/3Mp2 =const. But k 2 > H 2 [1]. This is because we neglect the term 3H\u03b4 \u03c6\u0307k in the\nequation (1). On the other hand, as suggested by observation [4] we need | ns \u2212 1 |< 0.1,\nso | kt0 |< 0.1. Introducing dimensionless T and R as t0 = 10T /Mp and \u03c1 = Mp4 /10R one\nget the inequality\nR \u2212 2T > 2 + lg(8\u03c0/3) \u223c 2.92.\nThis inequality represent restriction to possible values of t0 and initial energy density \u03c1.\nOne can see that if t0 \u223c 10\u221235 s then \u03c1 < 10\u221219 Mp4 so we have not normal initial conditions\nfor the chaotic inflation.\n\n4\n\nDensity perturbations.\n\nAs we have seen the Darboux transformation allows one to obtain a set of potentials which\nlead to the flat (or almost flat) spectrum. But we should distinguish between the spectrum\n\n\fof the scalar field and the spectrum of density perturbations 4 . An investigation of this\nquestion by Lyth [7], Brandenberger [8] and others suggests that even though the scalar\nfield perturbations with flat spectrum can be generated by this effect, it does not lead\nto perturbations of metric with flat spectrum. In particularly, Brandenberger in [8] has\nconsidered the simplest potential which lead to the scale factor a(t) \u223c tp . For extremely\nslow contraction with p \u223c 0 he get a blue spectrum with index n \u223c 3. It is interesting to\nconsider more general class of potentials and we'll do it in this section.\nIn the case of general position one can't solve the Einstein equations exactly to find\nthe scale factor a(t) but using the Darboux transformations we can construct a rich set\nof exact soluble potentials so this method it is interesting itself.\nLet consider the Einstein equations (in the units with c = 8\u03c0G = 1)\n1 1 2\nH =\n\u03c6\u0307 + V (\u03c6) ,\n3 2\n\n\u2032\n\n\u0012\n\n2\n\n\u03c6\u0308 + 3H \u03c6\u0307 + V = 0,\n\n\u0013\n\n(20)\n\nso \u03c6\u03072 = \u22122\u1e22. Introducing \u03c8(t) = a(t)3 one get \u03c8\u0308 = 3V \u03c8. If we add positive cosmological\nterm \u039b > 0 then this equation can be written as the Schr\u00f6dinger equation\n\u0011\n\n\u0010\n\n\u03c8\u0308 = u + \u03bb2 \u03c8,\n\n(21)\n\nwhere u(t) = 3V (\u03c6(t)), \u03bb2 = 3\u039b. We denote the scale factor and the Hubble \"constant\"\nin the universe with \u03bb = 0 as a = a(t) = \u03c8 1/3 , H = H(t) whereas the same in the universe\nwith \u03bb 6= 0 will be \u00e3 = \u03c8\u0303 1/3 and H\u0303.\nWe suppose that in our universe the \u03bb2 = 0. Some researchers are suggested that\nthe reason of the recently discovered accelerated expansion of the universe is the nonzero\ncosmological term. Indeed, it is easy to formulate usual inflationary theory to obtain this\naccelerated expansion. To do it one can add a small constant term V0 > 0 to the potential\nV (\u03c6) [9] 5 . If cosmological constant V0 \u223c 10\u2212120 (in Planck units) then one get the present\naccelaration [10], but is not terrifically because it is not clear why should V0 be so small?\nThis approach return us to the old mystery of vacuum energy [11] and this is why we\nsuppose that \u03bb2 = 0 in our universe. The solutions of (20) with nonzero cosmological\nterm will be necessary for the Darboux transformation (see below).\nThe Darboux transformation for the (21) has the form\n \u0307\nu \u2192 u(1) = u \u2212 2\u03c3\u0303,\n\n\u03c8 \u2192 \u03c8 (1) = (\u03c3 \u2212 \u03c3\u0303) \u03c8,\nwhere \u03c3 = d log \u03c8/dt, \u03c3\u0303 = d log \u03c8\u0303/dt. One get\nH (1) = \u2212H\u0303 +\n\n\u03bb2\n,\n9(H\u0303 \u2212 H)\n\n(22)\n\ntherefore the dressed scale factor a(1) (t) has the form\na(1)\n\n\uf8ee\n\nconst\n\u03bb2\n=\nexp \uf8f0\u2212\n\u00e3\n9\n\nZ\n\nd\n\u00e3\ndt\nlog\ndt\na\n\n!\u22121 \uf8f9\n\uf8fb.\n\n(23)\n\nAt last, dressed potential V (1) (\u03c6(1) ) can be written in parametrical form,\n2\n3\n \u0307\n(1)\nV (t) = V (t) \u2212 2H\u0303,\n(1)\n\n\u03c6(1) (t) = \u03c60 \u2212\n4\n5\n\ns\n\nZ\n\nv\nu\nu\ndtt\n\nH + H\u0303\n\u03bb4\n \u0307\n+ \u03bb2\n+ 3H\u0303,\n2\n9(H \u2212 H\u0303)\nH \u2212 H\u0303\n\nI'd like to thank prof. A. Linde who drew my attention to this circumstance.\nCosmology with negative potentials were considered in [10].\n\n(24)\n\n\f(1)\n\nwhere \u03c60 is constant.\nThis method of construction of exact soluble potentials is valid both for usual inflation\ncosmology and for the effective field theory of the Ekpyrotic/Cyclic Universe. In the last\ncase the scalar field \u03c6 represents the position of the bulk brane in the fifth dimensions.\nFollowing Brandenberger one consider the scale factor a(t) \u223c (\u2212t)p (time is negative). If\n\u03bb2 = 0 then\n3p(3p \u2212 1)\nu(t) =\n.\nt2\nThe solution of (21) with \u03bb2 6= 0 has the form\n\u221a\n\u03c8\u0303 = \u2212t (c1 K\u03bd (\u2212\u03bbt) + c2 I\u03bd (\u2212\u03bbt)) ,\n(25)\nwhere \u03bd = \u00b1(1 \u2212 6p)/2, c1 > 0 and c2 > 0 are constants, K\u03bd and I\u03bd are modified Bessel\nfunction (if \u039b < 0 then the solution of the (21) will be expressed via Hankel functions but\nthe final result will be the same), t < 0 and we choose \u03bd > \u22121 to obtain real and positive\nsolution (25). For the small \u03bbt one get\n\u2212\u03bbt\nc1\n\u03c8\u0303 = \u221a \u0393(\u03bd)\n2\n2\u03bb\n\n!\u2212\u03bd\u22121/2\n\n+ c2\n\ns\n\n\u2212\u03bbt\n2\n\u0393(\u03bd + 1)\n\u03bb\n2\n\n!\u2212\u03bd+1/2\n\n.\n\n(26)\n\nUsing (23), (26) and well known relations between modified Bessel functions and it's\n(1)\nderivatives [12] we have a(1) \u223c (\u2212t)p . The power p(1) is depend on initial power p. For\nexample, if 1/3 < p < 1/2, then p(1) = p \u2212 1/3, so 0 < p(1) < 1/6, and we have blue\nspectrum with index\n6\n2\n=1+\n.\nn=1+\n(1)\n1\u2212p\n4 \u2212 3p\nIf p \u2192 1/3 then we get the extremely slow contraction and the spectrum with index n \u223c 3.\nAnother values of p(1) can be obtained starting out from the another choices of p. The\ngeneral conclusion is that all new potentials leads to the old result of Brandenberger. In\nother words we have not the flat spectrum of perturbations of metric.\n\n5\n\nConclusion.\n\nUp to know, Darboux transformations didn't used in cosmology (by contrast with quantum mechanics and the theory of integrable PDE). In this paper we are used only simple\nexample of Darboux transformation. One can construct infinite set of potentials which\nlead to the flat spectrum with arbitrary multiple precision. We can do it without any\nbrane-string physics and we don't need consider field theory with power-low potential\nwhen n > 40.\nOn the other hand, it is valid only for the spectrum of the scalar field and, to all\nappearances, don't valid for the spectrum of density perturbations. Using Darboux transformations, one can construct infinite set exact soluble cosmologies with flat spectrum of\nthe scalar field perturbations and, at the same time, with \"essentially blue\" spectrum of\nperturbations of metric.\nAcknowledgements.
