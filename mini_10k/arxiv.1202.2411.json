INTRODUCTION\n\nGalaxy clusters trace the growth of structure in the\nuniverse. Their abundance and evolution is critically sensitive to underlying cosmological parameters such as \u03a9M ,\n\u03c38 , and the dark energy equation of state parameter w.\nRecent work has focused on using galaxy clusters to constrain cosmology, including dark energy constraints from\nX-ray and joint X-ray/SZ measurements of the gas mass\nfraction (Allen et al. 2008; Ettori et al. 2009; LaRoque\net al. 2006), cosmological parameter constraints from the\ngrowth of structure via X-ray (Mantz et al. 2008, 2010;\nVikhlinin et al. 2009) and SZ cluster surveys (Vanderlinde et al. 2010; Marriage et al. 2011; Sehgal et al. 2010;\nMuchovej et al. 2011; Williamson et al. 2011; Benson\net al. 2011).\nIn this paper, we present a method for the joint analysis of X-ray and SZ cluster observations using a selfconsistent analytic model for the physical properties of\nthe intra-cluster medium (Bulbul et al. 2010). The model\nprovides analytic expressions for the radial density, tem1 Department of Physics, University of Alabama, Huntsville, AL\n35899\n2 Space Science-VP62, NASA Marshall Space Flight Center,\nHuntsville, AL 35812\n3 Kavli Institute for Cosmological Physics, University of\nChicago, Chicago, IL 60637\n4 Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics, University of\nChicago, Chicago, IL 60637\n5 Enrico Fermi Institute, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL\n60637\n6 Department of Physics, University of Chicago, Chicago, IL\n60637\n7 Owens Valley Radio Observatory, California Institute of Technology, Big Pine, CA 93513\n8 NASA Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, MD 20771\n9 Hubble Postdoctoral Fellow\n10 Columbia Astrophysics Laboratory, Columbia University,\nNew York, NY 10027\n11 Department of Physics, Columbia University, New York, NY\n10027\n12 Einstein Postdoctoral Fellow\n13 Department of Physics and Astronomy, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA 19104\n\nperature, and pressure profiles, and is therefore simultaneously applicable to both X-ray and SZ observables.\nThe joint analysis allows measurement of the cluster gas\nmass fraction without the need to impose external priors on cosmological parameters such as the Hubble expansion rate H(z). Such an analysis applied to a sample of clusters can directly probe the evolution of cluster gas mass fractions with redshift. We demonstrate\nthe method using high signal-to-noise data from Chandra and Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Array (SZA) observations of\ntwo clusters, Abell 2631 and Abell 2204.\nThe method developed in this paper combines all available Chandra X-ray data (both imaging and spectroscopic) with SZ observations, using these to determine\nthe angular diameter distance and cluster mass with minimal cosmological assumptions. We chose the Bulbul\net al. (2010) model for this analysis since it describes the\nthree thermodynamical cluster properties \u2013 density, temperature, and pressure \u2013 with a consistent set of parameters that are both readily interpreted. The temperature\nprofile linking density and pressure is both easily calculated and observationally motivated. This work differs\nfrom Mroczkowski et al. (2009) who used SZ and X-ray\nimaging data only with a simplified, core-cut form of the\nVikhlinin et al. (2006) model to describe the X-ray density and the Nagai et al. (2007) parameterization of the\nSZ pressure, and for which the inferred temperature profile did not reduce to a compact, accessible expression.\nThis paper is structured as follows: Section 2 describes\nthe data reduction and analysis, Section 3 the modeling\nof X-ray and SZ data, and Section 4 the joint analysis\nof the X-ray and SZ data. We present and discuss our\nconclusions in Section 5.\n2. DATA REDUCTION\n\nWe selected a non-cool core cluster (Abell 2631) and\na cool-core cluster (Abell 2204) with high quality X-ray\nand SZ observations to demonstrate the method of analysis.\n\n\f2\n\nFig. 1.- SZ contours overlaid on X-ray false color images of Abell 2631 (left) and Abell 2204 (right ). The Chandra X-ray surface\nbrightness data are from the energy range 0.7\u20137.0 keV. The color bars reflect the number of counts detected by Chandra in the 0.7-7 keV\nband, with a pixel size of 1.97 arcsec. The SZ data are from the SZA, and the contour levels are (+2,-2,-4,-6,-8,...) times the rms noise\n(see Table 1). The FWHM of the synthesized beams for these SZ observations are shown in the lower left corner of each image.\n\n2.1. Chandra Imaging and Spectroscopy\n\nThe Chandra X-ray data are in the form of event files,\nwhich we use to generate both images and spectra. Additional blank-sky composite event files are used for background subtraction. The event files are reduced using\nCIAO 4.3.1 and CALDB 4.3, following the reduction procedure described in Bulbul et al. (2010). Details of each\ncluster observation can be found in Table 1.\nThe X-ray images in the 0.7-7 keV band are used to\nmeasure the X-ray surface brightness profile of the cluster. To subtract the background from the surface brightness, we rescale the blank-sky image to match the cluster surface brightness in a peripheral region that is free\nof cluster signal. The peripheral regions we chose are\nat a distance \u2265 500 arcsec from the cluster center for\nAbell 2631 (corresponding to 2.7 Mpc in the standard\nflat \u039bCDM cosmology) and \u2265 550 arcsec (1.7 Mpc) for\nAbell 2204.\nSpectra are extracted in annular regions centered at\nthe peak of the X-ray emission. These regions cover an\narea out to the radius where the surface brightness profile reaches the background, which is near r500 (the radius\nwithin which the average density is 500 times the critical density at the cluster redshift) for these observations.\nFrom the blank-sky data, background spectra are also\nextracted and processed. We then rescale the blank-sky\nspectra to match the count rate of the cluster spectra\nin the 9.5-12 keV band. In this band, Chandra has no\neffective area for the detection of photons, and the detected counts originate from a particle background that\nis time variable. Hickox & Markevitch (2006) showed\nthat while the flux within the 2\u20137 keV and 9.5\u201312 keV\nenergy bands can vary with time, the ratio of the two\nbands remains constant. Subtracting the blank-sky data\nrescaled by the higher-energy band therefore accurately\nremoves the background from the lower-energy band.\nAfter rescaling the blank-sky spectra and removing the\nbackground from our cluster data, residuals may still be\npresent in the soft 0.7\u20132 keV energy band. These soft\n\nX-ray residuals may be due to Galactic and extragalactic emission, and may vary as function of position (e.g.,\nSnowden et al. 1997) and time (e.g., Takei et al. 2008).\nFor each cluster observation, we use a peripheral region\nthat is free of cluster emission-the same region used\nto rescale the background images-to determine whether\nsoft residuals are present after the blank-sky background\nhas been subtracted. We detect the presence of soft residuals in both clusters. The residual spectra are fit using a phenomenological model that includes a power law\nand a plasma emission model, and this model is rescaled\nby area and included in the spectral fit for each annulus (e.g., Snowden et al. 1998; Nevalainen et al. 2005;\nMaughan et al. 2008).\n2.2. Interferometric Observations with the SZA\n\nThe two clusters were observed with the SunyaevZel'dovich Array (SZA), an eight-element interferometer\ndesigned for the detection and imaging of the SZ effect.\nEach antenna in the array is 3.5 m in diameter and has\na primary beam FWHM of 10.7\u2032 at the center frequency\nof the observing band (31 GHz). For these observations,\nsix antennas were closely packed together to provide sensitivity to arcminute-scale SZ signals, and the remaining two antennas were placed further out to constrain\nthe flux contributions from unresolved radio sources, as\ndescribed in Muchovej et al. (2007). The unflagged onsource time for Abell 2631 was 16.1 hours and 19.6 hours\nfor Abell 2204.The details of the observations are given\nin Table 1, and the radio sources detected in each field\nare listed in Table 2. In the analysis of the cluster SZ effect described below, the parameters of the SZ decrement\nand the radio sources are fit simultaneously.\nThe SZA data are reduced using a set of routines written in MATLAB14 that constitute a complete pipeline\nfor flagging, calibrating, and reducing visibility data.\nThe reduction pipeline, described in Muchovej et al.\n(2007), converts the data to physical units and cor14\n\nhttp://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab\n\n\f3\nrects for instrumental phase and amplitude variations.\nData are flagged for corruption due to bad weather,\nsources of radio interference, and other instrumental effects that could impact their quality. The pipeline outputs calibrated unflagged visibilties, i.e., components of\nthe Fourier transform of the sky brightness multiplied by\nthe primary beam response, along with their corresponding statistical weights and positions in the Fourier (u\u2212v)\nplane.\n3. MODELING THE X-RAY AND SZ DATA\n\nThe X-ray observable is spatially resolved spectroscopy, and temperature and metallicity of the intracluster plasma are measured using the X-ray spectroscopic data. The X-ray surface brightness is defined as\nZ\n1\nSX =\nn2e \u039bee (Te , A)dl\n(1)\n4\u03c0(1 + z)3\nwhere l is the line of sight through the cluster, ne is the\nelectron density, Te is the electron temperature, A is the\nmetallicity, and \u039bee (Te , A) is the X-ray cooling function\n(in units of counts cm3 s\u22121 ) as a function of electron\ntemperature and metallicity. The density, temperature,\nand metallicity can vary along the line of sight.\nThe observable from the SZ data is the amplitude of\nthe spectral distortion of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) in the direction of the cluster. This distortion is due to inverse Compton scattering of CMB\nphotons off electrons in the intracluster medium (ICM),\nand results in a decrement in the CMB brightness temperature at frequencies . 218 GHz. The magnitude of\nthe decrement is proportional to the electron pressure\nintegrated along the line of sight (Sunyaev & Zel'dovich\n1972):\nZ\nkTe\ndl\n(2)\n\u2206TSZ = TCMB \u03c3T f (x, Te )ne\nme c2\nwhere TCMB is the temperature of the CMB, f (x, Te ) contains the frequency dependence of the SZ temperature\nsignature using the relativistic corrections provided by\nItoh et al. (1998) and Nozawa et al. (2006), \u03c3T is the\nThomson cross section, me is the electron mass, and c is\nthe speed of light.\nAssuming spherical symmetry, the line of sight integration element dl relates to the angular element (in radians) as dl = DA d\u03b8, where DA is the angular diameter\ndistance. From Equations 1 and 2, we find\nZ\nSx \u221d DA n2e \u039bee (Te , A)d\u03b8\n(3)\nZ\n\u2206TSZ \u221d DA ne Te d\u03b8.\n(4)\nThe combination of X-ray imaging spectroscopy and SZ\nobservations can be used to simultaneously measure the\ndistribution of the electron density, the electron temperature, and the angular diameter distance (e.g., Hughes\n& Birkinshaw 1998; Grego et al. 2000; Reese et al. 2002;\nGrainge et al. 2002; Saunders et al. 2003; Bonamente\net al. 2006). For further discussion on the SZ effect and\nits use for cosmology, see reviews by Birkinshaw (1999)\nand Carlstrom et al. (2002).\nWe describe the density and temperature profiles of the\nhot plasma in galaxy clusters using the model proposed\n\nby Bulbul et al. (2010):\n\u22121\nne (r) = ne0 \u03c6(r, rs , \u03b2)n \u03c4cool\n\n(5)\n\nT (r) = T0 \u03c6(r, rs , \u03b2)\u03c4cool\n\n(6)\n\nwhere\n\u03c6(r, rs , \u03b2) =\n\n1\n(1 + r/rs )\u03b2\u22122 \u2212 1\n,\n(\u03b2 \u2212 2) r/rs (1 + r/rs )\u03b2\u22122\n\u03b1 + (r/rcool )\u03b3\n,\n\u03c4cool =\n1 + (r/rcool )\u03b3\n\n(7)\n(8)\n\nne0 is the normalization of the pressure profile, n is the\npolytropic index, rs is the scale radius, T0 is the normalization factor for the scaling of the temperature profile,\n\u03b3 is the slope of the cooling function, and \u03b1 is the cooling parameter which ranges from 0 to 1. One attractive\nfeature of these models is that they provide a simple analytic form for the electron pressure:\nPe (r) = Pe0 \u03c6(r, rs , \u03b2)n+1 ,\n\n(9)\n\nwhere Pe0 = ne0 kT0 is the pressure normalization. The\nfree parameters of the model, which are used to jointly\nfit the X-ray and SZ data, are ne0 , T0 , rs , rcool , \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, n\nand the distance DA .\nParameter estimation is done using a Monte Carlo\nMarkov chain (MCMC) method described in Bonamente\net al. (2004). Correlation among model parameters is a\nfeature of most analytic models, including the one used in\nthis paper. Parameter correlations can result in low acceptance rates and thus slow convergence of the Markov\nchains (e.g., Gilks et al. 1996). In our implementation,\nsteps of the MCMC are proposed along the set of directions which diagonalize the covariance of the posterior\ndistribuition, determined via singular-value decomposition of an initial test chain, resulting in efficient exploration of the parameter space (see Appendix).\n3.1. X-ray Data Analysis\n\nThe annular bins in the temperature profile (Figure 2)\nwere chosen by starting with an initial 10\u2032\u2032 bin and then\nincreasing each bin by 50% of the width of the previous\nbin to give roughly the same counts per bin. Following the analysis of the systematic uncertainties for the\nX-ray data described in Bulbul et al. (2010), we adopt\na 1% systematic uncertainty on the count rate of each\nbin of the surface brightness profile and a 10% systematic uncertainty on the temperature of each spectral region as discussed in Section 4.5.1. Figure 2 shows the\ntemperature and surface brightness profiles, along with\nthe best-fit models, for the fit to the X-ray data only\nof Abell 2631 and Abell 2204. Since our model has the\nsame parameters for both density and temperature, the\nsurface brightness profile carries a larger weight in the\nfit. The model fits are acceptable for both clusters to\nwithin the plotted errors, which include the systematic\nuncertainties associated with the surface brightness and\ntemperature discussed in Section 4.5. For Abell 2631,\nthere is insufficient signal to constrain n and \u03b2 simultaneously. In this case, we fix \u03b2 = 2, which is equivalent\nto assuming that the total mass follows a Navarro et al.\n(1997) profile at large radii (see Section 4.3).\n\n\f4\n\nFig. 2.- X-ray surface brightness and temperature profiles for Abell 2631 (left column) and Abell 2204 (right column). Top panels:\nSurface brightness profiles where the black points are derived from the X-ray images, the red line shows the best fit model, and the green\nline is the background level determined from the blank sky observations. The residuals show the fractional difference between the model\nand the data. A 1% systematic uncertainty has been added in quadrature to the datapoints. We plotted the surface brightness profiles\nbeyond the fitted region to show the agreement between the cluster emission and background. Bottom panels: Temperature profiles where\nthe red line shows the best fit model and the dark, medium, and light grey regions show the 68%, 95.4%, and 99.7% confidence levels\nobtained from the model fits. A 10% systematic uncertainty has been added in quadrature to the temperature bins.\n\n3.2. SZ Data Analysis\n\n4.1. Consistency of X-ray and SZ measurements of the\n\nAfter removal of compact radio sources in the cluster\nfield, the visibilities V\u03bd (u, v) measured by the SZA can be\nrelated to the Fourier domain equivalent of the integrated\nCompton-y parameter Y (u, v) (see, e.g., Mroczkowski\net al. 2009). This is defined as\n\nelectron pressure profiles\nX-ray and SZ observations provide independent measurements of the radial distribution of the electron pressure. The X-ray observables are the electron temperature\nand surface brightness, the latter depends on the square\nof the electron density according to Equation 1; the SZ\nobservable, on the other hand, is directly proportional\nto the electron pressure integrated along the line of sight\n(Equation 2).\nThe two observables can be affected by different\nsources of systematic uncertainties. For example, the\npresence of non-thermal X-ray emission (e.g., Million &\nAllen 2009; Bonamente et al. 2005; Sarazin & Lieu 1998)\ncould result in the increase of the X-ray emission above\nthe level of the thermal gas, and radio emission from\ncluster halos (e.g., Brunetti et al. 2007) may partially\nfill the SZ decrement. Another source of systematic uncertainty is the assumption of spherical symmetry in the\nanalysis (e.g., Sulkanen 1999), which would result in a\ndifferent measurement of the pressure from X-ray and\nSZ observations. A discussion of sources of systematic\nuncertainty in the analysis of X-ray and SZ observations\nis presented in Section 4.5. A comparison of the pressure\nprofiles from SZ and X-ray observations is therefore useful to determine the presence of sources of emission that\n\nY (u, v) \u2261\n\nV\u03bd (u, v)\n,\ng(x) I0\n\n(10)\n\nwhere g(x) corrects for the frequency dependence of the\nSZ flux, and I0 = 2(kB TCMB )3 /(hc)2 is the primary CMB\nintensity normalization. Figure 3 shows Y (u, v) along\nwith the best-fit model, for the fit to the SZ data only of\nthe two clusters.\n4. JOINT ANALYSIS OF X-RAY AND SZ DATA\n\nWe first perform a consistency check of the determination of the pressure profiles from the X-ray and SZ data.\nWe then focus on determinations of the angular diameter\ndistance and the radial profile of the gas mass fraction\nusing the consistent parameterization of density, temperature and pressure provided by the ICM model for the\njoint analysis of the X-ray and SZ observables.\n\n\f5\nboth values are consistent with those calculated using a\nstandard a \u039bCDM cosmology at the 1\u2013\u03c3 level. The measurement of the DA for Abell 2204 is also in agreement\nwith that of Bonamente et al. (2006). The measurement\nof the angular diameter distance for a given cluster is\naffected by a number of systematic effects (Bonamente\net al. 2006), and the agreement of DA with the \u039bCDM\nvalue is expected for a large sample but not necessarily\nfor individual clusters, as it is for the two clusters in this\npaper.\n4.3. Radial profiles of the gas mass fraction independent\n\nof cosmological parameters\nBy using direct measurement of DA as described in\nSection 4.2, we can also obtain radial profiles of the gas\nmass, total mass, and the gas mass fraction without the\nneed to use priors on the cosmological parameters. The\ngas mass Mgas is computed by integrating the gas density\nprofile within the volume,\nZ\nZ\n2\n3\nMgas = 4\u03c0\u03bce mp ne (r)r dr = 4\u03c0\u03bce mp DA\nne (\u03b8)\u03b82 d\u03b8,\n\nFig. 3.- SZ visibility profiles for Abell 2631\u221a(top) and Abell 2204\n(bottom) plotted as a function of u\u2212v radius ( u2 + v2 ). The plots\nshow the real components of the measured Y (u, v) along with the\nbest fit model.\n\ncan cause differences between the two measurements.\nWe perform a joint fit to the X-ray and SZ data using Equation 9, with the normalization of the SZ pressure\nmodel independent of the X-ray density and temperature\nnormalizations. The common parameters in the models\n(rs , \u03b2, and n) are linked between the two datasets, thus\nrequiring the X-ray and SZ pressure profiles to have the\nsame shape. In this analysis, we adopt the angular diameter distance appropriate for the cluster redshift in a\n\u039bCDM model with h = 0.73, \u03a9M = 0.27 and \u03a9\u039b = 0.73.\nThe pressure inferred from the X-ray and SZ measurements are within 20% of one another for both clusters,\nconsistent with the statistical and systematic effects (Tables 3 and 6); results for a larger sample of clusters can\nbe found in Bonamente et al. (2011). Note that the measurement of the ratio of X-ray pressure to the SZ pressure\ndepends on the choice of the Hubble parameter, since the\npressure normalizations are degenerate with the value of\nDA assumed in the analysis.\n4.2. Direct measurement of the angular diameter\n\ndistance\nWe also perform a joint X-ray and SZ analysis which\nenables us to place direct constraints on the angular diameter distance without using priors on the cosmological\nparameters (e.g., Hughes & Birkinshaw 1998; Birkinshaw\n1999; Reese et al. 2002; Bonamente et al. 2006). For this\nanalysis, we link the shape parameters and the pressure\nnormalizations between the X-ray and SZ data, and allow DA to vary. For Abell 2631 and Abell 2204 we mea46.6\nsure DA = 798.9 \u00b1308.1\n267.4 Mpc and DA = 575.3 \u00b155.6 Mpc,\n\n(11)\nwhere \u03bc is the mean molecular weight (calculated assuming metal abundances of 0.3 solar, Anders & Grevesse\n1989), mp is the proton mass, and dr = DA d\u03b8. The total\nmass Mtot is computed assuming hydrostatic equilibrium\nbetween the gravitational mass and the thermal pressure\nof the gas:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n4\u03c0\u03c1i rs3\n1\n1/(1 \u2212 \u03b2) \u2212 r/rs\nMtot (r) =\n\u03c4cool (r),\n+\n(\u03b2 \u2212 2) \u03b2 \u2212 1\n(1 + r/rs )\u03b2\u22121\n(12)\nwhere \u03c1i = (T0 k(n + 1)(\u03b2 \u2212 1))/(4\u03c0G\u03bcmp rs2 ).\nFigure 4 shows the radial profiles of the gas mass,\ntotal mass, and gas mass fraction for Abell 2631 and\nAbell 2204. The uncertainties reflect the fact that DA\nis also measured directly from the data, and that no assumption about the value of the cosmological parameters\nH0 , \u03a9M or \u03a9\u039b was made.\n4.4. Measurement of the gas mass fraction at an\n\noverdensity radius\nIn cosmological applications (e.g., via the distribution\nof fgas with redshift, Allen et al. 2008) fgas is typically\nmeasured within an overdensity radius. The radius r\u2206\nis defined as the radius within which the average matter\ndensity of the cluster is \u2206 times the critical density of\nthe universe at the cluster's redshift:\n3\nr\u2206\n\u2261\n\nMtot (r\u2206 )\n,\n4\u03c0\n3 \u2206\u03c1c (z)\n\n(13)\n\nwhere \u03c1c (z) = (3H02 E 2 (z))/(8\u03c0G) is the critical density\nof the universe, H0 is the Hubble constant, and E 2 (z)=\n\u03a9M (1 + z)3 + \u03a9\u039b + \u03a9k (1 + z)2 in the \u039bCDM model.\nThe joint X-ray and SZ analysis provides cosmologyindependent constraints on DA and on the radial profile of fgas (r) (Sections 4.2 and 4.3). The radius r\u2206\nand therefore all quantities calculated out to this radius retain a cosmological dependence through the factor \u03c1c (z) appearing in Equation 13. In the following we\ndescribe a method to marginalize the measurement of\nfgas (r\u2206 ) over the cosmological parameters, which results\n\n\f6\n\nFig. 4.- Top Panels; left Abell 2631, right Abell 2204 : Gas mass profiles determined from the joint analysis of Chandra/SZA observations\nfor Abell 2631 and Abell 2204. Middle Panels: Total mass profiles. Bottom Panels: Gas mass fraction profiles. The dashed lines are\nthe 68% confidence level at each radius. Grey areas show the measurements at radii r2500 and r500 , obtained by marginalization over the\ncosmological parameters. Chandra calibration systematics are included in the measurements.\n\nin a weak cosmology dependence of our joint measurements of fgas (r\u2206 ).\nIn what follows, we adopt the standard flat FriedmanRobertson-Walker (FRW) cosmological model, parameterized by H0 and \u03a9M , with \u03a9\u039b = 1\u2212\u03a9M, which is known\nto provide a good fit to other cosmic distance data (Allen\net al. 2008; Freedman et al. 2009; Percival et al. 2010).\nWithin this model, a given DA value corresponds to a\ncurve in the (H0 , \u03a9M ) plane described by\nZ z\nd\u03b6\nc\n, (14)\nH0 =\nDA (1 + z) 0 [\u03a9M ((1 + \u03b6)3 \u2212 1) \u2212 1]1/2\nwhere spatial flatness is assumed. For each step in the\nMarkov chain of each cluster, we use the corresponding\nvalue of DA to generate a consistent pair of cosmological\nparameters by drawing a random value of \u03a9M from a uniform distribution on [0,1], and calculating the associated\nvalue of H0 from Equation 14. We then use these parameters when calculating r\u2206 and the other fit parameters\n\nof the chain. This approach has the advantage of using\nminimal prior information on the cosmological parameters, with \u03a9M free to range between 0 and 1, and DA\nmeasured directly from the data. This method properly\naccounts for the covariance between r\u2206 , fgas (r\u2206 ), DA\nand the other parameters of the fit. For the flat FRW\nmodel and the low redshifts in question, this procedure\ncorresponds, to very good approximation, to the use of\nuniform priors on H0 and \u03a9M . We note, however, that\nthis correspondence does not necessarily hold for higher\nredshifts (z \u223c1) or for other cosmological models. The\nmeasurements of masses and fgas at r2500 and r500 are\nindicated as grey areas in Figure 4 and are listed in Table\n4.\nFor comparison, we also provide the measurements of\nmasses and fgas using the X-ray data with a fixed DA\ncalculated from the standard flat \u039bCDM cosmology, and\npriors on \u03a9M from the WMAP measurements of Ko-\n\n\f7\nmatsu et al. (2011). The results are reported in Table 5.\n4.5. Sources of Systematic Uncertainty\nThe sources of systematic uncertainty on the gas mass\nfraction and the integrated X-ray and SZ pressure are\nlisted in Table 6. The individual errors are added in\nquadrature to determine the total systematic uncertainty\non fgas and the integrated pressure. Systematics from\nChandra instrument calibration and the X-ray background are included in the fitting of the data, and the\nvalue of masses and fgas in Tables 4 and 5 account for\nthese systematics. Since this joint analysis method can\nbe applied to larger samples of clusters, we also indicate\nwhether the impact of each source of systematic uncertainty is reduced with sample size.\n4.5.1. Instrument Calibration\n\nChandra's ACIS effective area has a spatially dependent non-uniformity at the level of \u00b11% and therefore\nwe add a \u00b11% uncertainty to the surface brightness\ndata. We also adopt a \u00b110% uncertainty on the temperature measurements to account for uncertainty in the lowenergy calibration of the effective area (see, e.g., Bulbul\net al. 2010). These uncertainty estimates for the Chandra calibration are folded into the mass measurements\nreported in Tables 3, 4 and 5.\nFrequent observations of Mars are used to calibrate the\nSZA absolute flux scale; we employ the Rudy (1987) flux\nmodel which has an estimated absolute calibration uncertainty of \u00b15%. The stability of the instrumental gain\nis \u00b13%, as determined from repeated calibrator measurements in SZA survey fields (Muchovej et al. 2011). The\nabsolute calibration and instrumental gain yield a global\n\u00b16% uncertainty on the SZA calibration. We rescaled\nthe SZA data by the \u00b16% uncertainty on the SZA calibration and compared the measurements to the original\nanalysis. We found a \u00b16% systematic uncertainty on the\npressure and \u00b110% systematic uncertainty on the gas\nmass fraction at r2500 and r500 . The uncertainty associated with instrument calibration does not average down\nwith sample size.\n4.5.2. Kinetic SZ Effect\n\nReese et al. (2002) reports that for a cluster with a\ntemperature of 8.0 keV and with a typical velocity along\nthe line of sight of 300 km/s (Watkins 1997; Colberg et al.\n2000) the kinetic SZ effect would be \u00b14% of the thermal\nSZ for 30 GHz observations. Accordingly we use a \u00b14%\nuncertainty due to the kinetic SZ effect on the gas mass\nfraction and the SZ pressure profiles for measurements at\nr2500 and r500 . This source of uncertainty averages down\nby a factor of the square root of the size of the sample.\n4.5.3. Radio Source Contamination\n\nUndetected radio sources not accounted in the modeling could lead to a biased measurement of the SZ decrement. We use the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at\nTwenty-centimeters (FIRST) database as a reference for\nlocating compact radio sources within 10\u2032 of the cluster\ncenter. Most radio sources that will affect the 30 GHz\ndata (rms noise \u223c 0.25 mJy) will have counterparts in\nthe FIRST survey (rms noise of 0.15 mJy at 1.4 GHz);\ninverted spectrum sources may not have counterparts at\n\n1.4 GHz and will affect our measurement of the SZ decrement, but they comprise a small fraction of the source\npopulation (Muchovej et al. 2010, Fig. 3).\nWe determine the effect of undetected point sources\nby placing a radio source model at each FIRST source,\nfixing the position and marginalizing over the flux. In\nthe pressure model (Equation 7), we fixed the parameters\nrs , n, \u03b2, and DA and let Peo be free. We compare the\npressure profiles with the original analysis (see Table 2)\nand find a \u2264 1% difference in the pressure of each cluster.\nTherefore we conservatively apply a 1% uncertainty on\nthe pressure and 2% uncertainty on the gas mass fraction\nat r2500 and r500 .\n4.5.4. Asphericity\n\nAlthough we assume a spherical model in our analysis,\nmost clusters do not appear to be circular in shape in Xray or radio observations. LaRoque et al. (2006) reports\na 10 \u2212 20% uncertainty in the measurement of the gas\nmass fraction due to asphericity; therefore we use \u00b120%\nas a conservative estimate for measurements at r2500 and\nr500 . This uncertainty also averages down by a factor of\nthe square root of the sample size, as shown in Sulkanen\n(1999), provided the selection of the sample is unbiased\nwith respect to cluster shape.\n4.5.5. Hydrostatic Equilibrium Assumption\n\nThe assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium at large\nradii results in an underestimate of the total mass. This\nis due to the presence of non-thermal pressure which can\nbias hydrostatic equilibrium measurements of the total\nmass (Evrard et al. 1990). According to Lau et al. (2009)\nthe total mass of a relaxed cluster such as Abell 2204 will\nbe biased by \u22126% at r2500 and \u22128% at r500 , and for unrelaxed systems such as Abell 2631 by \u22129% at r2500 and\n\u221211% at r500 . Therefore we adopt a systematic uncertainty of \u22129% and \u221211% in our error analysis for measurements at r2500 and r500 .\n4.5.6. X-ray Background\n\nThe X-ray background is determined from the ACIS\nblank sky composite event file. We normalize the\nblank sky background level for each observation using\nan emission-free region on the ACIS detector. We adjusted the background normalization factor by a factor\nof \u00b12\u03c3 and propagated this through the analysis, and\nfound that this produces a \u00b12% uncertainty on the background count rate. This uncertainty affects the surface\nbrightness and temperature measurements resulting in\na \u00b12% and \u00b19% uncertainty on the gas mass fraction\nmeasurements at r2500 and r500 , and a \u00b12% uncertainty\non the X-ray pressure profiles at both radii. This uncertainty averages down by a factor of the square root of\nthe sample size.\n4.5.7. Systematics associated with the use of the Bulbul\n\net al. (2010) models\nThe Bulbul et al. (2010) model assumes a polytropic\nrelationship between the ICM density and temperature\nat large radii. To estimate uncertainties associated with\nthe polytropic assumption, we compare our X-ray masses\nfor the two clusters in our sample with those calculated\nusing the Vikhlinin et al. (2006) model, which provides\n\n\f8\nan independent parameterization of the thermodynamic\nquantities. From this comparison, we find that the gas\nmass fraction measurements varies by \u2264 10% at all radii\nbetween the Bulbul et al. (2010) and Vikhlinin et al.\n(2006) models. We estimate the uncertainty on the corresponding pressure profiles by comparing the integrated\npressures between the two models, and the comparison\nresults in an uncertainty of \u00b13% at r2500 and \u00b15% at\nr500 . We consider these uncertainties as a rough estimate of the systematics associated with the Bulbul et al.\n(2010) model.\n4.5.8. Helium Sedimentation\n\nThe effect of helium sedimentation may be an additional source of systematic uncertainty. In our measurements we assume that the hydrogen to helium ratio\nis uniform throughout the cluster. However, theoretical studies (Fabian & Pringle 1977; Rephaeli 1978) suggest helium sedimentation effects may affect cluster mass\nmeasurements. Peng & Nagai (2009) finds that the bias\nin gas mass fraction from the presence of helium sedimentation is less than 10% at \u223c r2500 and negligible at\nr500 . Accordingly, we estimate a systematic uncertainty\nof 10% at r2500 and \u22645% at r500 for the measurement\nof the gas mass fraction. Bulbul et al. (2011) applied\nthe Peng & Nagai (2009) helium sedimentation simulation model to a sample of clusters and demonstrated the\neffects on the gas mass and total mass. The integrated\npressure is proportional to the gas mass, and we use the\nvalues from Bulbul et al. (2011) to determine upper limits to the systematic uncertainty in the measurement of\npressure of \u22124% at r2500 and \u22122% at r500 .\n5. CONCLUSIONS\n\nWe demonstrate the use of the Bulbul et al. (2010)\ncluster model for simultaneous fitting of X-ray data and\nSunyaev-Zel'dovich effect data. The model employs a\ncompact parameterization that relates the three primary\nthermodynamic quantities by the ideal gas law at all\nradii. We consider X-ray data from Chandra and 30-GHz\n\nSZ data from the SZA for both clusters, Abell 2631 and\nAbell 2204 and find that the model adequately captures\nthe radial variation in both the X-ray surface brightness\nand SZ Compton-y profiles. For all clusters, separate determinations of the electron pressure from the X-ray and\nSZ data yield profiles that are statistically consistent.\nJoint analysis of the X-ray and SZ data provides a direct measure of DA , the angular diameter distance to\nthe cluster, that is independent of cosmology. For both\nclusters, this analysis yields a measure of DA that is consistent with the standard \u039bCDM values at the 1-\u03c3 level.\nUsing the measured angular diameter distance as a constraint between H0 and \u03a9M , we marginalize over the implicit cosmology dependence of the overdensity radius to\nobtain estimates of fgas at r2500 and r500 that are only\nweakly dependent on \u03a9M .\nWe discuss possible sources of systematic errors in the\nfgas determination, and find that most will be mitigated\nif fgas is averaged over a large sample of clusters. A\nsample spanning a large redshift range can be used to\nconstrain the evolution of fgas with redshift, and for constraining cosmological models with clusters (e.g., Sasaki\n1996; Pen 1997; Reese et al. 2002; Allen et al. 2004;\nLaRoque et al. 2006; Bonamente et al. 2006; Allen et al.\n2008; Ettori et al. 2009).\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThe operation of the SZA is supported by NSF through\ngrant AST-0604982 and AST-0838187.

(2006) model, and the Bulbul et al. (2010) model used in this paper. The\nMonte Carlo Markov chain (MCMC) method for the analysis of X-ray and SZE data described in Bonamente et al.\n(2004) accounts for this correlation, and therefore correlation is not an issue when evaluating integrated quantities\nsuch as masses and Y values, and their uncertainties. Strong parameter correlation, however, may cause the MCMC\nto be inefficient in its sampling of parameter space (see, e.g., Gilks et al. 1996, page 90), requiring long chains with low\nacceptance rate because of the poor mixing. A common solution is the use of a singular value decomposition (SVD,\ne.g., Press et al. 1992) to perform a linear transformation of the parameters to reduce the correlation among model\nparameters, and increase of the rate of acceptance in the Monte Carlo Markov chain. For the X-ray analysis of the\nChandra data of Abell 2631 shown in Table 5, the four model parameters (ne0 , rs , n and \u03b2) are transformed into four\nSVD parameters (svd0 through svd3 ), and the usual Metropolis-Hastings MCMC is applied to the SVD parameters.\nThe accepted parameters are then transformed back to the original Bulbul et al. (2010) model parameters, for which\nwe calculate integrated quantities.\nThe effect of the reparameterization is shown in Figures 5 and 6. The strong correlation present between certain\npairs of parameters, especially rs and n, is absent from the SVD parameters. The values of the correlation coefficients\n\nFig. 5.- Scatter plot for parameters of the Bulbul et al. (2010) model applied to the X-ray analysis of Abell 2631. Notice the strong\ncorrelation among some of the parameters, especially n and rs . For clarity, only every 100-th parameter in the chain is plotted.\n\nfor the original parameters and the SVD parameters are shown in Table 7. With this reparameterization, we obtain\nan acceptance rate of approximately 30%, which is a factor of few higher than the typical acceptance rate obtained\nusing the original parameters.\nTABLE 7\nCorrelation Coefficients for the X-ray Analysis of Abell 2631\nParameter\nneo\nrs\nn\nTxo\n\nneo\n***\n\nrs\n-0.85\n***\n\nn\n-0.82\n1.00\n***\n\nParameter\nsvd0\nsvd1\nsvd2\nsvd3\n\nsvd0\n***\n\nsvd1\n-0.01\n***\n\nsvd1\n-0.14\n0.02\n***\n\nTxo\n0.31\n-0.37\n-0.35\n***\nsvd3\n0.21\n-0.04\n-0.15\n***\n\n\f12\n\nFig. 6.- Scatter plot for the SVD parameters of the same chain as in Figure 5.\n\n\f"}
