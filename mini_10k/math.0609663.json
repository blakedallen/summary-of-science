Introduction and Statements of Results\nProperty (T ), introduced by Kazhdan in 1966 in [19], plays a fundamental role\nin the study of discrete subgroups of Lie groups and more general finitely generated\ngroups. In this paper we propose a stronger property, which we call property F \u2297\nH, which is a direct strengthening of one equivalent definition of property (T ). It\nfollows from work of Delorme and Guichardet that property (T ) is equivalent to the\nstatement that H 1 (\u0393, \u03c0, H) = 0 whenever H is a Hilbert space and \u03c0 is a continuous\nunitary representation. This is easily seen to be equivalent to the statement that any\ncontinuous affine isometric \u0393 action on a Hilbert space has a fixed point, commonly\ncalled property F H.\nDefinition 1.1. Let D be a topological group, we say D has property F \u2297 H if for\nevery\n(1) F a finite dimensional vector space over R or C,\n(2) continuous homomorphism \u03c0 : D\u2192GL(F ),\nDate: November 20, 2018.\nFirst author partially supported by NSF Grants DMS-0226121 and DMS-0541917. Second author\npartially supported by NSF VIGRE grant DMS-0240058.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nDAVID FISHER AND THERON HITCHMAN\n\n(3) Hilbert space H, and\n(4) continuous unitary representation \u03c02 : D\u2192U(H),\nthe first continuous cohomology group H 1 (\u0393, \u03c01 \u2297\u03c02 , F \u2297H) = 0.\nWe refer to representations \u03c01 \u2297\u03c02 as in the definition above as finite dimensional by\nunitary representations. Throughout this paper, cohomology for topological groups\nwill be continuous cohomology. It is easy to show that property F \u2297 H is equivalent\nto having any continuous affine action of D with finite dimensional by unitary linear\npart has a fixed point. The notation for property F \u2297 H evokes both the fixed point\nproperty F H generalized here and the tensor product in the finite dimensional by\nunitary representations that appear in the definition.\nThroughout this paper a semisimple Lie group will be a connected semisimple Lie\ngroup with finite center. We will not consider the case of semisimple Lie groups which\nare not algebraic, see the end of \u00a72 for discussion of related examples. We will also\nalways assume that G is simply connected as an algebraic group, i.e. that every cover\nof G which is algebraic is isomorphic to G. With this assumption, G is the direct\nproduct of it's simple factors [22, Proposition I.1.4.10]. As it is obvious that property\nF \u2297 H passes to quotients, there is no loss of generality in this assumption. The main\nresult of this paper is the following:\nTheorem 1.2. Let D be a semisimple Lie group or a cocompact lattice in such. Then\nD has property F \u2297 H if and only if it has property (T ).\nOn Theorem 1.2:\n(1) For D a connected semisimple Lie group and \u03c02 irreducible, or more generally\nadmissible, the desired vanishing follows from known results on relative Lie\nalgebra cohomology. It does not appear possible to deduce the general case\nfrom this, mainly because those results do not seem to yield estimates on the\nsize of solutions to cohomological equations, see \u00a75.1.\n(2) For a general locally compact group D and a cocompact lattice \u039b < D, it\nfollows from work of Blanc that if D has F \u2297 H then \u039b has F \u2297 H [1]. The\nconverse (shown to hold for property (T ) by Kazhdan) is not immediate.\n(3) We prove Theorem 1.2 for cocompact lattices and prove it for the ambient\ngroup from that. The proof does not proceed by deducing F \u2297 H from (T ),\nbut rather uses the fact that G and \u0393 have (T ) as long as G has no factors\nlocally isomorphic to SO(1, n) or SU(1, n).\n(4) It is not true in general that property F \u2297 H is equivalent to property (T ).\nThe easiest example is SL(n, Z)\u22c9Zn for n > 2, see \u00a72 below.\n(5) F \u2297 H for cocompact lattices was announced in [12, Theorem 1.8].\n(6) The issue of whether non-uniform lattices have F \u2297 H seems quite subtle and\nwill be addressed elsewhere.\nAs mentioned above, the main step is proving Theorem 1.2 for cocompact lattices.\nWe deduce F \u2297 H for G from F \u2297 H for irreducible cocompact lattices in G\u00d7G.\n\n\fSTRENGTHENING (T )\n\n3\n\nOur proof also depends on a use of the Margulis-Corlette-Gromov-Schoen superrigidity theorems, which classify all finite dimensional representations of the lattices we\nconsider [5, 15, 21, 22].\nFor cocompact lattices we translate the question into one concerning the de Rham\ncohomology of the associated locally symmetric space with coefficients in a flat F \u2297H\nbundle. We then use a Bochner-Matsushima-type formula to prove an estimate on\nthe first eigenvalue of the Laplacian on one forms that implies vanishing of first\ncohomology. In order to define a Laplacian one requires a choice of metric on F \u2297H,\nand our choice here is similar to the one made by Matsushima and Murakami in [25].\nIn fact, the work here is very close to the work in that paper, and we eventually reduce\nto an estimate on eigenvalues of the same finite dimensional matrix as they do. These\nestimates are obtained by Raghunathan in [29]. It is possible to derive the formula\nwe use by closely following the derivation in [25]; however, we choose a different\nmethod. From our point of view, the estimate follows by subtracting two standard\nWeitzenb\u00f6ck formulas for different bundle structures on the same vector bundle. The\nuse of two bundle structures is also a key technique in [25], but the relation of the\ncomputations there to standard differential geometric computations is not clear. One\nbenefit of our point of view is that it makes it immediately clear why the negative\nRicci curvature of M does not spoil the computations: it appears in both formulas,\nand cancels when they are subtracted. It is worthwhile to compare our differential\ngeometric interpretation of the formula from [25] to a well known differential geometric\ninterpretation of an earlier Bochner-type formula of Matsushima for trivial bundles\n[23]. This well-known differential geometric interpretation is due to Calabi, was first\ndescribed in print in detail by Dodziuk [7], and played a key role in the development\nof geometric superrigidity [18, 27]. As in those works, our Bochner formula will be\nuseful in non-linear settings, see [10, 12].\nIn \u00a74.4.6, we deduce some vanishing results for H i (\u0393, \u03c01 \u2297\u03c02 , F \u2297H) for more restricted choices of F . These results are probably not optimal. A reader familiar with\nthe literature on cohomology of Lie groups and lattices might wonder why we do not\npursue an analysis based on relative Lie algebra cohomology and methods closer to\nthose of [2, 34, 44]. Approaches of this kind, whether directly to show vanishing for\nG cohomology, or indirectly to show vanishing of \u0393 cohomology via Matsushima-type\nformulas, encounter analytic difficulties. We discuss the issues that arise in \u00a75. We\nremark that our work gives a new interpretation of the Matsushima-Murakami formula for the Laplacian on vector bundles of the form (K\\G\u00d7F )\u0393 which is used in the\nproof of Matsushima's formula. Our more geometric interpretation of this formula\nmay be of interest even to those primarily interested in traditional applications of\nMatsushima's formula.\nIn addition, the estimate on the Laplacian proved here using the Bochner method\nis also used in our work on harmonic maps into continuum products [10, 12].\nIn [11], using results in [9] we prove a local rigidity theorem for many geometric\nactions of groups with property F \u2297 H on compact manifolds. This can be seen as\n\n\f4\n\nDAVID FISHER AND THERON HITCHMAN\n\na generalization of the theorem of the first author and Margulis on local rigidity of\nisometric actions of groups with property (T ) [14].\nParts of this work were supported by visits to the Graduate Center of the City\nUniversity of New York, Indiana University and Rice University. We thank these\ninstitutions for their hospitality and support. We would also like to thank Nicolas\nMonod for suggesting the name property F \u2297H.\n2. Other groups and property F \u2297 H\nOther than the groups that arise in Theorem 1.2, other groups known to have\nproperty (T ) fall into a few distinct classes. In this section we discuss which of these\nhave or do not have property F \u2297 H.\nLet H be a Lie group with Levi decomposition H = L\u22c9Rn and assume that L is\nsemisimple with no compact factors and property (T ) and that the L representation\non Rn has no invariant vectors. Then H is known to have property (T ), see e.g.\n[6, 40, 43]. In many cases, it is obvious that H contains lattices, e.g. SL(n, Z)\u22c9Zn <\nSL(n, R)\u22c9Rn . For a more detailed discussion of H's containing lattices, see [38]. In\nany case, we have:\nProposition 2.1. If H is as in the preceding paragraph, then both H and any lattice\nin H fail to have property F \u2297 H.\nProof. It is clear that H admits an action on Rn with no fixed points, by letting\n(l, v) * w = lw + v where l \u2208 L acts on w by the representation defining the semidirect\nproduct. It is also clear that this action has no fixed points when restricted to a lattice\nin H. This can be viewed as providing non-trivial cohomology classes in H 1 (H, Rn )\nor H 1 (\u0393, Rn ).\n\u0003\nThis observation extends to more general semidirect products L\u22c9U with U unipotent, we leave the construction of more examples to the reader. For all other groups\nwe know of with property (T ), the key fact seems to be the following simple lemma.\nLemma 2.2. Let D be a group with property (T ) such that every continuous finite\ndimensional representation of D over R or C is unitary. Then D has property F \u2297H.\nThe lemma allows us to deduce that many other known examples of groups with\nproperty (T ) also have property F \u2297 H simply by verifying the hypotheses of Lemma\n2.2 for those groups. This is clear for higher rank semisimple algebraic groups defined\nover local fields other than R or C. For lattices in those groups, it follows from\nMargulis' superrigidity theorems [22]. For quotients of lattices in SP (1, n) and F4\u221220\nby infinite index normal subgroups it follows from Corlette's superrigidity theorem\n[5]. For any group where property (T ) derives from an action on a simplicial complex\nwith a spectral condition on links, it can be deduced from work of Wang, SchoenWang or Izeki-Nayatani [40, 35, 17]. It seems to us that for most models of random\ngroups it is at least the case that (T ) implies F \u2297 H with probability one. This is\n\n\fSTRENGTHENING (T )\n\n5\n\nmost clear in Zuk's model of random group where the proof of property (T ) amounts\nto proving that the random group has a properly discontinuous cocompact action on\na simplicial complex with an appropriate spectral condition on links [45]. For a longer\ndiscussion/comparison between models of random groups, we recommend [28].\nWe believe that non-uniform lattices in semisimple Lie groups with property (T )\nwill also have property F H. While the case of Q-rank 1 lattices seems quite approachable, the general case involves some significant difficulties. We hope to pursue\nthis elsewhere.\nThere is a class of groups with property (T ) for which we currently do not know\nif property F \u2297 H holds. If G is a semisimple Lie group (as above), there can exist\ninfinite, non-split central extensions of G by Zd . The simplest examples of these\noccur when G is the isometry group of an irreducible K\u00e4hler symmetric space and\nthe universal cover G\u0303 is a central extension of G by Z. Other examples also exist.\nIt is known that these groups and their lattices have property (T ) by an argument\ndue to Serre, exposed in [6]. We do not know if these groups have property F \u2297 H.\nSerre's argument does not adapt easily to our setting, so it appears that a new idea\nis needed for this case.\n3. Reductions to cohomology of cocompact lattices\nIn this section we begin the proof of Theorem 1.2 by reducing to the following:\nTheorem 3.1. Let G be a semisimple Lie group with property (T ) of Kazhdan and\nno compact factors, and \u0393 a torsion-free, irreducible, cocompact lattice in G. Let\n\u03c01 : G\u2192GL(F ) be a non-trivial, finite dimensional, real representation that does not\ncontain the trivial representation and \u03c02 : \u0393\u2192U(H) be a (real) unitary representation\non a separable Hilbert space. Then H 1 (\u0393, \u03c01|\u0393 \u2297\u03c02 , F \u2297H) = 0.\nThis theorem is proved in section \u00a74 below.\n3.1. First reductions on G and \u0393. In this section, we show how to reduce to the\ncase of \u0393 an irreducible torsion-free lattice in a non-compact semisimple group or G a\nsimple Lie group. The results are not difficult and we leave the proofs to the reader.\nLemma 3.2. Any compact group has property F \u2297 H.\nHence, it suffices to consider the case where G is noncompact. By a lemma of\nSelberg, every lattice contains a torsion-free normal subgroup of finite index [36]. We\nalso have the following standard lemma.\nLemma 3.3. Let \u0393\u2032 be a finite index normal subgroup of \u0393 and \u03c1 any representation of\n\u0393 on a real or complex vector space. Then H p (\u0393\u2032 , \u03c1|\u0393\u2032 ) = 0 implies that H p (\u0393, \u03c1) = 0.\nTherefore, we assume from now on that any lattice is torsion free and pass to finite\nindex subgroups without further comment.\n\n\f6\n\nDAVID FISHER AND THERON HITCHMAN\n\nRecall that a lattice in a semisimple Lie group is irreducible if it projects densely\ninto all simple factors. If \u0393 is not irreducible then, possibly after passing to a subgroup\nof finite index in \u0393, we have G = G1 \u00d7 G2 , \u0393 = \u03931 \u00d7 \u03932 , where \u0393i is a lattice\nin G [22, Definition II.6.5 and Theorem II.6.7]. So if \u0393 is not irreducible, after\npassing to a subgroup of finite index, there is a (split) short exact sequence of groups\n0 \u2192 \u03931 \u2192 \u0393 \u2192 \u03932 \u2192 0. The resulting long exact sequence in cohomology contains a\nportion of the form\n(3.1)\n\n* * * \u2192 H 1 (\u03932 , \u03c1) \u2192 H 1 (\u0393, \u03c1) \u2192 H 1 (\u03931 , \u03c1) \u2192 * * * .\n\nHence, vanishing of H 1 for both \u03931 and \u03932 implies H 1 (\u0393, \u03c1) = 0. Induction on the\nnumber of irreducible factors reduces us to the case of irreducible lattices.\nWhen proving Theorem 1.2 for Lie groups, an argument like the one just given\nallows us to reduce to the case of G a simple non-compact Lie group.\n3.2. Decompositions of representations. In this subsection we show how reduce\nto the case \u03c01 does not contain a unitary subrepresentation and when all representations are real. Recall that a representation which is C linear is also R linear.\nLemma 3.4. Let \u03c1 be any continuous complex linear representation of a topological\ngroup D on a complex Hilbert space W and let \u03c1|R be the associated real representation,\nthen H 1 (D, \u03c1, W ) = H 1 (D, \u03c1R , W ) as real vector spaces.\nThe next observation is a special case of a general decomposition into irreducibles\nfor representations of the type we consider. We do not state the general version\nhere, simply to avoid a discussion of direct integrals. Again, the lemma stated is not\ndifficult.\nLemma 3.5. Let D be a topological group and \u03c0 a continuous finite dimensional by\nunitary representation of D. Assume \u03c01 is completely reducible and let (\u03c01 , F ) =\n\u2295(\u03c01i , Fi ) be a decomposition into irreducible representations, then\nX\nH 1 (D, \u03c01 \u2297\u03c02 , F \u2297H) =\nH 1 (D, \u03c01i \u2297\u03c02 , F i \u2297H).\ni\n\nIn particular, if D has property (T ), and any F i is a unitary D representation,\nthen \u03c01i \u2297\u03c02 is unitary and H 1 (\u0393, \u03c01i \u2297\u03c02 , F i \u2297H) = 0.\nOn decomposing \u03c02 : It is also possible to decompose \u03c02 into irreducible representations using a direct integral. In this case, the analogue of Lemma 3.5 is not\nobvious, since solving a cohomological equation in every irreducible integrand of a\ndirect integral does not necessarily solve the integral of the cohomological equation.\nThis is already true for infinite direct sums, see \u00a75 for more discussion.\nLemma 3.6. Let D be either a countable discrete group or a topological group containing a countable dense subset. Then to prove H 1 (D, \u03c0) = 0 for all continuous finite\ndimensional by unitary representations \u03c0 it suffices to consider \u03c0 = \u03c01 \u2297\u03c02 where \u03c02\nis a representation on a separable Hilbert space.\n\n\fSTRENGTHENING (T )\n\n7\n\nProof. We prove the lemma first for D a countable discrete group and then explain\nthe modifications necessary for when D is not discrete.\nLet \u03c0 = \u03c01 \u2297\u03c02 be a finite dimensional by unitary representation of D on F \u2297H\nfor H arbitrary and c a cocycle in H 1 (D, \u03c01 \u2297\u03c02 , F \u2297H). We will show that c takes\nvalues in F \u2297Hc where Hc is a separable Hilbert space and F \u2297Hc is \u03c0 invariant. It\nthen follows that c is a coboundary for \u03c0 if and only if it is a coboundary for \u03c0|F \u2297Hc .\nConsider the set D*c = {\u03c0(d1 )c(d2 )|d1 , d2 \u2208D}. This set is countable. If \u03c0 were a\nunitary representation, we would take the span of the closure of D*c and consider the\nrestriction of \u03c0 to this, necessarily separable, subspace. In our setting, a little more\ncare is required. Since F is finite dimensional, we can pick a finite basis, {f1 , . . . , fk }\nP\nfor F . Every element \u03c6 of D*c can now be written as \u03c6 = kj=1 fi \u2297\u03c8i\u03c6 where \u03c8i\u03c6 \u2208H.\nIt is clear that (D*c)H = {\u03c8i\u03c6 |\u03c6\u2208D*c, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 k} is a countable subset of H. Let Hc\nbe the closure of the span of (D*c)H , then it is clear that Hc is a closed separable\nHilbert subspace of H, that Hc is D invariant and that c takes values in F \u2297Hc . If c\nis a coboundary, then c(d) = \u03c0(d)v \u2212 v. If such a v exists, it clearly can be chosen in\nF \u2297Hc . Therefore c is a coboundary as a cocycle over \u03c0 if and only if c is a coboundary\nas a cocycle over \u03c0|F \u2297Hc .\nIf D is a topological group with countable dense subset D0 , we need only replace D*c\nby the countable set D0 *c = {\u03c0(d1 )c(d2 )|d1 , d2 \u2208D0 } and the same argument works.\nContinuity of \u03c0 and c imply that, in this case, the closure of the span D0 *c equals the\nclosure of the span of D*c. This then implies that F \u2297Hc constructed as above is a D\ninvariant closed, separable subspace of F \u2297H.\n\u0003\n3.3. Reductions via superrigidity theorems. In this subsection we recall a form\nof the Margulis-Corlette-Gromov-Schoen superrigidity theorems. Given a lattice \u0393 in\nG, and a representation \u03c0 : \u0393\u2192GL(F ), we say that \u03c0 almost extends to a continuous\nrepresentation of G if there exist representations \u03c01 : G\u2192GL(F ) and \u03c02 : \u0393\u2192GL(F ),\nwhere \u03c02 has bounded image and the images of \u03c01 and \u03c02 commute so that \u03c0(\u03b3) =\n\u03c01 (\u03b3)\u03c02 (\u03b3).\nTheorem 3.7. Let G be a semisimple Lie group with no compact factors and property\n(T ) of Kazhdan. Let \u0393 in G be a lattice and \u03c0 : \u0393\u2192GL(F ) a finite dimensional\nrepresentation. Then \u03c0 almost extends to a continuous representation of G.\nProof. This is a consequence of the strongest form of the superrigidity theorems. All\nthe ingredients needed are assembled by Starkov in [37], though the theorem is not\nstated in quite this generality there.\nFor G of higher rank and \u0393 irreducible, this is proved in [22], though it is not\nstated explicitly there. As noted in [13], it follows easily from from Lemma VII.5.1\nand Theorems VII.5.15 and VII.6.16 of [22]. However, when G contains rank one\nfactors and \u0393 (or some finite index subgroup) projects to a lattice in a rank one\nfactor one needs to use Corlette's work [5] to prove the analogue of [22, Theorem\nVII.5.15]. The proof of Theorem VII.6.16 is even more involved, as one needs to first\n\n\f8\n\nDAVID FISHER AND THERON HITCHMAN\n\nprove arithmeticity using work of Corlette and Gromov-Schoen and then deduce the\ntheorem from cohomology vanishing theorems for finite dimensional representations\nof \u0393. As noted in [37] this follows by assembling results from [29] and [31]. At various\npoints in the argument, one needs to pass to finite index subgroups, but this is not\nrequired in the statement of results by use of [22, Lemma VII.5.1].\n\u0003\nCorollary 3.8. Let G and \u0393 be as in Theorem 3.7. Let \u03c0 = \u03c01 \u2297\u03c02 be any \u0393 representation as in Definition 1.1. Then we can assume \u03c01 extends to G.\nProof. It is easy to check that if a representation \u03c0 of \u0393 can be written as \u03c0(\u03b3) =\n\u03c0 \u2032 (\u03b3)\u03c0 \u2032\u2032 (\u03b3) where \u03c0 \u2032 and \u03c0 \u2032\u2032 commute, then \u03c0 can be realized as a tensor product\nof representations \u03c00\u2032 \u2297\u03c00\u2032\u2032 . So, if \u03c01 does not extend to G, then as a consequence of\nTheorem 3.7, we can write \u03c01 = \u03c01\u2032 \u2297\u03c02\u2032 where \u03c01\u2032 extends and \u03c02\u2032 has bounded image.\n\u0003\nRegrouping \u03c0 as \u03c01\u2032 \u2297(\u03c02\u2032 \u2297\u03c02 ) proves the corollary.\n3.4. Reduction to cocompact lattices. The purpose of this subsection is to show\nhow one reduces the case of connected groups to the case of cocompact lattices. In\nthe following lemma, we call a lattice in a product G1 \u00d7G2 weakly irreducible if both\nprojections on factors are dense.\nLemma 3.9. Let G be a locally compact group and assume G\u00d7G admits a cocompact\nweakly irreducible lattice \u0393. Then if \u0393 has property F \u2297 H so does G.\nProof. Let \u0393 be a weakly irreducible lattice in G\u00d7G and (\u03c0, F \u2297H) a finite dimensional\nby unitary representation of G. If p1 is the projection of \u0393 on the first factor of G\u00d7G,\nthen \u03c0\u25e6p1 is also clearly a finite dimensional by unitary \u0393 representation. We will\nshow that H 1 (\u0393, \u03c0\u25e6p1 , F \u2297H) = 0 implies H 1 (G, \u03c0, F \u2297H) = 0. Any continuous\ncocycle c : G\u2192F \u2297H restricts to a p1 (\u0393) cocycle. A coboundary for \u0393 is a map of the\nform b(\u03b3) = \u03c0\u25e6p1 (\u03b3)v\u2212v. Note that continuity of \u03c0 and the formula for b immediately\nimply that b is continuous in the induced topology on p1 (\u0393) < G and so b extends\ncontinuosly to a G coboundary b(g) = \u03c0(g)v \u2212 v. If H 1 (\u0393, \u03c0\u25e6p1 , F \u2297H) = 0, then\nc\u25e6p1 (\u03b3) = b(\u03b3). Since both sides extend continuously to functions on G, they are\nequal on G as well, so c(g) = b(g) and H 1 (G, \u03c0, F \u2297H) = 0 as desired.\nIt is also possible to write this proof in terms of fixed points for affine actions. From\nthis point of view, the idea is that for a continuous affine G action, a fixed point for\na dense subgroup is necessarily a fixed point for G.\n\u0003\nOn Lemma 3.9:\n(1) The lemma is a fact about H 1 and has no obvious analogue for higher degree\ncohomology. The key point is that in a continuous G representation, a 1coboundaries for a dense subgroup extends continuously to a 1-coboundary\nfor G. This is not clear, and seems unlikely, for k-coboundaries when k > 1.\n(2) We recall that for every group G as in Theorem 1.2, there is a weakly irreducible cocompact lattice in G\u00d7G. This follows from our definition of irreducible lattice (note that we do not require that the projection to other\n\n\fSTRENGTHENING (T )\n\n9\n\nquotients of G\u00d7G be dense) and Borel's construction of lattices in [3]. To\nconstruct the lattice, one can simply construct an irreducible lattice (in the\nstandard sense) in Gi \u00d7 Gi for each simple factor Gi of G. Due to prior reductions, for our argument we need only construct irreducible cocompact lattices\nin G\u00d7G where G is simple.\n3.5. Proof that Theorem 3.1 implies Theorem 1.2.\nProof. By Lemma 3.2, Lemma 3.3 and the discussion around Equation 3.1, we see\nthat we may assume that G has no compact factors and that \u0393 is irreducible and\ntorsion free. By Lemma 3.4 it suffices to consider the case where \u03c0 = \u03c01 \u2297\u03c02 where \u03c01\nis a real linear representation and \u03c02 is a unitary representation over R. By Lemma\n3.6, it suffices to consider the case where H is a separable Hilbert space.\nBy Theorem 3.7 it suffices to prove Theorem 1.2 for representations which are of\nthe form \u03c01 \u2297\u03c02 where \u03c01 : G\u2192GL(F ) is a real linear representation and \u03c02 is a\nunitary representation of G or \u0393. By Lemma 3.5 and the fact that G representations\nare completely reducible, it suffices to consider the case where \u03c01 does not contain\nthe trivial representation.\nLemma 3.9 and the second remark following that lemma show how Theorem 1.2\nfor cocompact lattices implies Theorem 1.2 for connected groups.\n\u0003\n4. Vanishing theorems for uniform lattices\nIn this section we prove Theorem 3.1. Actually, we prove a more general result than\nTheorem 3.1 which includes some cases where G has factors of the form SO(1, n) or\nSU(1, n), see \u00a74.3. For this reason, until specified further, in this section G is a\nsemisimple Lie group with no compact factors and \u0393 \u2282 G is a cocompact lattice. We\nalso derive some results on higher cohomology groups in the case that the finite dimensional representation is complex instead of real. See \u00a74.4.6 for specific statements.\nFor this reason, much of the development in this section treats pth cohomology groups\nrather than just H 1 .\nThe main technical tool is an estimate on the Laplacian on smooth differential\nforms with values in a vector bundle. Assume that \u0393 is torsion free and let K be\na maximal compact subgroup of G. We build the locally symmetric Riemannian\nmanifold M = \u0393\\G/K and the locally constant vector bundle E(\u03c0) \u2192 M associated\nto the representation \u03c0 and the principal \u0393-bundle \u0393 \u2192 G/K \u2192 M. Note that the\nfiber of this bundle is the infinite dimensional vector space E = F \u2297 H.\nWe construct\nVp \u2217 an inner product in the fibers of E(\u03c0), and therefore inner products\n(*, *) on\nT M \u2297 E(\u03c0), the spaces of smooth E(\u03c0)-valued differential p-forms. Using\nthese inner products, we define an adjoint operator \u03b4 to the exterior derivative operation d and hence a Laplace operator \u25b3 = d\u03b4 + \u03b4d. The estimate we obtain is the\nfollowing.\n\n\f10\n\nDAVID FISHER AND THERON HITCHMAN\n\nTheorem 4.1. Let G, \u0393 and \u03c0 be as in 3.1. There is a positive constant C = C(G, \u03c01 )\nsuch that for any smooth differential 1-form, \u03b7, with values in E(\u03c0) we have\n(\u25b3\u03b7, \u03b7) \u2265 C(\u03b7, \u03b7).\nWe will need this result itself for our geometric cocycle superrigidity theorem. It will\nbe translated into an energy estimate and will play a crucial role by controlling a type\nof heat flow on a special set of mappings [10, 12].\nWe now outline the rest of the section. In \u00a74.1 we discuss some cohomology isomorphisms which reduce the problem to considering de Rham cohomology of smooth\np-forms with values in a vector bundle. In \u00a74.2 we introduce the necessary operations\non forms to define the Laplacian on a vector bundle. In \u00a74.3 we discuss how vanishing\ncohomology can be deduced from an estimate on this Laplacian. The material in these\nthree sections is mostly standard, though perhaps not well-known in our setting.\nIn \u00a74.4, we derive a useful Bochner-type formula for the Laplacian on our particular vector bundle. While our final estimate is similar to that of Matsushima and\nMurakami, the derivation follows a different conceptual outline. We then use this\nformula and some Lie-theoretic computations of Raghunathan to obtain the required\nestimates and deduce vanishing results. We discuss first cohomology in \u00a74.4.5 and\nhigher degrees in \u00a74.4.6. In \u00a74.5, we give a direct computation of the flat Laplacian.\n4.1. Some Cohomology Isomorphisms. Let K be a maximal compact subgroup\nof G. Let M = \u0393\\G/K, a compact locally symmetric manifold, and form the locally\nconstant vector bundle E(\u03c0) \u2192 M associated to the representation \u03c0 and the principal\n\u0393-bundle \u0393 \u2192 G/K \u2192 M. Note that the canonical fiber of this bundle is E = F \u2297H.\nLet E(\u03c0)loc denote the system of local coefficients on M defined by the bundle E(\u03c0) \u2192\nM.\nProposition 4.2. H \u2217 (\u0393, \u03c0) = H \u2217 (M, E(\u03c0)loc )\nThis isomorphism holds on the level of cochains [4]. Let \u021e \u2217 (M, E) denote the \u010cech\ncohomology of M with coefficients in the sheaf E of locally constant sections of E(\u03c0).\nProposition 4.3. H \u2217 (M, E(\u03c0)loc ) = \u021e \u2217 (M, E)\nOne can see this by inspecting the definitions. For more on sheaf cohomology, see\n\u2217\nfor example [41]. Let Hde\nRham (M, E(\u03c0)) denote the de Rham cohomology of smooth\nE(\u03c0)-valued differential forms on M. The exterior derivative d on E(\u03c0)-valued p-forms\nis defined as follows. For a form of the type \u03c9 = \u03b7 \u2297 e, where \u03b7 is an ordinary p-form\non M and e is a section of E(\u03c0), we set\nd\u03c9 = d\u03b7 \u2297 e,\nand extend linearly. Then one can define de Rham cohomology in the usual fashion.\n\u2217\nProposition 4.4. \u021e \u2217 (M, E) \u223c\n= Hde\nRham (M, E(\u03c0)).\n\n\fSTRENGTHENING (T )\n\n11\n\nThis is discussed by Mok [26]. The key point is that a version of the Poincar\u00e9 lemma\nholds. Using these isomorphisms, we restrict ourselves to the study of de Rham\ncohomology.\n4.2. The Laplacian on a Euclidean Vector Bundle. In this section we recall\nsome facts about Riemannian vector bundles. First, we recall the definitions of some\nstandard operations which lead to a definition of the inner product and the Laplacian\non the space of bundle-valued p-forms. Then we recall the Bochner-Weitzenb\u00f6ck\nformula for bundle-valued differential forms. A reference for this material is [8].\nThroughout this section, we consider a vector bundle V over a compact, oriented,\nRiemannian manifold N. We assume also that this bundle is Riemannian, that is, V\nis equipped with a connection \u2207 and a fiberwise Euclidean structure ( , ) which are\ncompatible in the sense that for any two sections a, b of V and any continuous vector\nfield X on N,\nX * (a, b) = (\u2207X a, b) + (a, \u2207X b).\np\nWe denote by A (V ) the space of smooth\non N with values in V , i.e. the\nVp p-forms\n\u2217\nspace of smooth sections of the bundle\nT N \u2297 V over N. Given the pair V, \u2207, one\ncan define the exterior derivative operator d for \u03c3 \u2208 Ap (V ) by\np+1\nX\n(\u22121)i+1 \u2207Xi (\u03c3(X1 , . . . , X\u0302i , . . . , Xp+1 ))\nd\u03c3(X1 , . . . , Xp+1) =\ni=1\n\n+\n\nX\n\n(\u22121)i+j \u03c3([Xi , Xj ], X1 , . . . , X\u0302i , . . . , X\u0302j , . . . , Xp+1 ),\n\ni<j\n\nwhere the hat means that that term is omitted. Note that d2 is not necessarily zero.\nIn fact, d2 = 0 if and only if the connection \u2207 is flat.\nIn the case of E(\u03c0), the differential d which computes de Rham cohomology is\nconstructed by this process, d2 = 0 and the bundle is flat.\n4.2.1. The inner product on V -valued forms. The Hodge star operation for ordinary\np-forms on N inducesPa similar operation on V -valued forms which we shall also\ndenote by \u2217. For \u03c9 = \u03b7I \u2297 eI where I is a multi-index of length p, \u03b7I is an ordinary\np-form and eI is a section of V , we have\nX\n\u2217\u03c9 =\n(\u2217\u03b7I ) \u2297 eI .\nLet V \u2217 be the dual vector bundle to V . The Euclidean structure in the fibers of V\ndefines an isomorphism # : V \u2192 V \u2217 which is determined by the condition that for\nux , vx in the fiber of V over x \u2208 N\nhux , #vx i = (ux , vx )x ,\nwhere h*, *i denotes the natural pairing of V and V \u2217 . We note that the operations \u2217\nand # commute.\n\n\f12\n\nDAVID FISHER AND THERON HITCHMAN\n\nP\nWe define a wedge product for V -valued forms. Let \u03b8 = |I|=p \u03b8I \u2297 eI be an V P\nvalued p-form and \u03b7 = |J|=q \u03b7J \u2297 fJ an V \u2217 -valued q-form. We define an ordinary\n(p + q)-form, \u03b8t \u2227 \u03b7, on N as follows\nXX\n\u03b8t \u2227 \u03b7 =\nheI , fJ i\u03b8I \u2227 \u03b7J .\nI\n\nJ\n\nThe transpose notation is used since the forms live in different bundles and this is\nnot the standard wedge product.\nWe now define the inner product of a pair of V -valued p-forms. For two such forms\n\u03c91 , \u03c92 , we set\nZ\nZ\nt\n(4.1)\n(\u03c91 , \u03c92 ) =\n\u03c91 \u2227 \u2217#\u03c92 =\n\u03c91t \u2227 # \u2217 \u03c92 .\nN\n\nN\n\nWe use the same symbol here for the inner product of forms, the inner product in\nthe fibers of V and the induced inner products in various associated bundles.

A Sufficient Condition for Vanishing. In this section we show that an estimate of the type in Theorem 4.1 implies vanishing of cohomology. The argument is\nclose to one due to Mok, compare to the proof of [26, Proposition 1.3.1].\nProposition 4.8. Suppose that there exists a positive constant C such that for all\nsmooth E(\u03c0)-valued p-forms \u03b8 on M\n(4.6)\nThen\n\n(\u25b3\u03b8, \u03b8) \u2265 C(\u03b8, \u03b8).\np\nHde\nRham (M, E(\u03c0))\n\n= 0.\n\nProof. In order to give the proof, we need a more general viewpoint on our forms\nto employ some functional analysis. Let Ap (M, E(\u03c0)) be the Hilbert space of E(\u03c0)valued differential forms \u03b7 on M for which \u03b7, d\u03b7 and \u03b4\u03b7 satisfy an L2 condition with\nrespect to our inner product (*, *). Smooth p-forms are a dense in Ap (M, E(\u03c0)). By a\nsimple approximation argument, condition 4.6 of Proposition 4.8 holds for all forms\nin Ap (M, E(\u03c0)) if it holds for all smooth forms. We need the following lemma from\nfunctional analysis\n\n\f14\n\nDAVID FISHER AND THERON HITCHMAN\n\nLemma 4.9 (H\u00f6rmander [16], Lemma 4.1.1, page 78). Let \u03c6 : H1 \u2192 H2 be a densely\ndefined linear operator between two Hilbert spaces with adjoint \u03c6\u2217 . Suppose that H3 \u2282\nH2 is a closed linear subspace which contains the range of \u03c6. Then the range of \u03c6 is\ndense in H3 if and only if for some constant C > 0\n(4.7)\n\n||v||H2 \u2264 C||\u03c6\u2217 v||H1\n\nfor all v in the intersection of H3 with the domain of \u03c6\u2217 .\nWe apply this result to the the exterior derivative map\nd : Ap\u22121 (E(\u03c0)) \u2192 ker d \u2282 Ap (E(\u03c0)).\nNote that for an element \u03b7 of ker d we have (\u25b3\u03b7, \u03b7) = (\u03b4\u03b7, \u03b4\u03b7), so equation 4.7 follows\nfrom equation 4.6.\nSince any smooth closed E(\u03c0)-valued p-form \u03b7 lies in the kernel of d, we see that\nthere is a solution to the equation du = \u03b7. It remains to be show that u can be chosen\nsmooth. This is true for the solution having minimal L2 -norm.\nTo see that a solution of minimal norm exists, let t = inf{||u||2 | du = \u03b7} and\nconsider a sequence ui of elements of Ap (M, E(\u03c0)) with dui approaching t. The ball\nof L2 -forms having norm bounded by 2t is weak-* compact, so we may extract a\nweak-* subsequential limit of the ui . By lower semicontinuity of the L2 norm, we see\nthat\n||u||2 \u2264 lim inf ||ui ||2 = t.\nWe claim that this limit u is also a solution to du = \u03b7. Let \u03c8 be a smooth test form.\nWe have (\u03b7, \u03c8) = (dui , \u03c8) = (ui , \u03b4\u03c8) \u2192 (u, \u03b4\u03c8) = (du, \u03c8). Hence du = \u03b7.\nWe now show that \u03b4u = 0. Suppose that \u03b4u = g is not zero. Then there exists\nan h such that (g, h) = (\u03b4u, h) = (u, dh) =: b > 0. Notice this is also true when\nwe replace h by rh where r is a positive real number. Let a = (dh, dh) > 0 and\npick a positive real number r < 2a/b. Let w = u \u2212 rdh. Then dw = du = f , and\n(w, w) = (u, u) \u22122r(u, dh) + r 2(dh, dh) = (u, u) \u2212r(2a\u2212br) < (u, u). This contradicts\nthe minimality of the norm of u, so we conclude that \u03b4u = 0.\nNow note that the form \u03bd = \u03b4\u03b7 is a smooth form, and by construction u satisfies\n\u25b3u = (d\u03b4 + \u03b4d)u = \u03b4\u03b7 = \u03bd.\nSo the elliptic regularity theorem implies that u is a smooth form. Thus we see that\nevery smooth closed E(\u03c0)-valued p-form bounds.\n\u0003\n4.4. A variant of the Matsushima-Murakami Bochner formula. Our goal in\nthis section is to develop a variant of the Bochner-Weitzenb\u00f6ck formula for E(\u03c0)valued p-forms on M which is analogous to the one found by Matsushima and Murakami [25]. As with all formulae of this type, this formula will be a computation\nof the difference between two second order operators on E(\u03c0)-valued p-forms and the\ndifference is a zeroth order (algebraic) operator related to curvature. Then we analyze\nthis algebraic operator to prove Theorem 4.1.\n\n\fSTRENGTHENING (T )\n\n15\n\nOne could give a development directly mirroring that of [25]. Instead, we give an\nalternate derivation which we feel is more intuitive and makes the relation to other\nBochner-type formulae more explicit.\nThe key observation of Matsushima and Murakami in [25] is that the relevant vector\nbundle can be constructed in two distinct ways, that is, there are two (isomorphic)\nnatural vector bundles associated to the given data. This allows us to compare the\nnatural differential operators arising from the two constructions.\nIn \u00a74.4.1, we exhibit two distinct vector bundle structures on E(\u03c0). In \u00a74.4.2, we\ndefine a preferred Riemannian metric on E(\u03c0). We discuss the computation of the\nconnections compatible with the metric in the two bundle structures in \u00a74.4.3, and\nthen, in \u00a74.4.4, we derive our version of the Matsushima-Murakami Bochner formula\nin terms of the representation \u03c0 and the structure of G (or, rather, its Lie algebra g).\nWe deduce the required estimates and the vanishing theorems which follow in \u00a74.4.5\nand \u00a74.4.6.\n4.4.1. Some bundle isomorphisms. Recall that \u0393 < G is a torsion free lattice and\nK < G is a maximal compact subgroup of G. We are working with the situation\nwhere K acts on G by right multiplication, \u0393 acts on G by left multiplication and\nour compact manifold is M = \u0393\\G/K. In fact, G is a right principal (\u0393 \u00d7 K)-bundle\nover M, where \u0393 \u00d7 K acts by the rule\n(4.8)\n\ng * (\u03b3, k) = \u03b3 \u22121 gk.\n\nWe denote the quotient map by q : G \u2192 M.\nOn Equation 4.8: Equation 4.8 may surprise readers not familiar with standard\nconventions on principal bundles. The action described is a right action, or equivalently, an action of the opposite group. This convention is used in the literature on\nconnections on principal bundles and we use it here to remain consistent with the\n[20]. This convention is not typically used in the theory of flat bundles. However,\nsince the opposite group is canonically isomorphic to the original group, proving the\nvanishing result for the opposite group of \u0393 is equivalent to the same result for \u0393.\nWe are interested in two representations \u03c3 and \u03c3 \u2032 of \u0393 \u00d7 K on E = F \u2297 H, defined\nas follows.\n\u03c3(\u03b3, k)v = (\u03c01 (\u03b3) \u2297 \u03c02 (\u03b3))v,\n\u03c3 \u2032 (\u03b3, k)v = (\u03c01 (k) \u2297 \u03c02 (\u03b3))v.\nWe build the vector bundles over M associated to the right principal bundle G \u2192 M\nand these representations, respectively E(\u03c3) and E(\u03c3 \u2032 ). Recall that E(\u03c3) is the\nquotient of G \u00d7 E by the right \u0393 \u00d7 K-action\n(g, v) * (\u03b3, k) = (\u03b3 \u22121 gk, \u03c3(\u03b3, k)\u22121v) = (\u03b3 \u22121 gk, (\u03c01 (\u03b3)\u22121 \u2297 \u03c02 (\u03b3)\u22121 )v),\n\n\f16\n\nDAVID FISHER AND THERON HITCHMAN\n\nand E(\u03c3 \u2032 ) is the quotient of G \u00d7 E by the (\u0393 \u00d7 K)-action\n(g, v) * (\u03b3, k) = (\u03b3 \u22121 gk, \u03c3 \u2032(\u03b3, k)\u22121 v) = (\u03b3 \u22121 gk, (\u03c01 (k)\u22121 \u2297 \u03c02 (\u03b3)\u22121 )v).\nWe shall denote the quotient maps here by Q : G\u00d7E \u2192 E(\u03c3) and Q\u2032 : G\u00d7E \u2192 E(\u03c3 \u2032 ).\nSince \u03c3(\u03b3, k) = \u03c0(\u03b3) for all (k, \u03b3) \u2208 K\u00d7\u0393, we have:\nLemma 4.10. As vector bundles over M, E(\u03c0) \u223c\n= E(\u03c3).\nThe following observation is a more general version of [25, Proposition 3.1].\nLemma 4.11. As vector bundles over M, E(\u03c3) \u223c\n= E(\u03c3 \u2032 ).\nProof. Consider the mapping A : G \u00d7 E \u2192 G \u00d7 E defined by\nA(g, v) = (g, (\u03c01 (g)\u22121 \u2297 IdH )v).\nThis is a bijective mapping which intertwines the \u0393\u00d7K actions inducing the quotient\nmappings Q and Q\u2032 . For each g \u2208 G the map v \u2192 A(g, v) is a linear isomorphism\nE \u2192 E, so A induces a vector bundle isomorphism A\u2032 : E(\u03c3) \u2192 E(\u03c3 \u2032 ).\n\u0003\nWe will use these isomorphisms as identifications without further comment.\n4.4.2. The Euclidean structure on E(\u03c0). We now construct a Euclidean structure on\nE(\u03c0). We begin with a second important observation of Matsushima and Murakami\nin [25]. Let g be the Lie algebra of G with a Cartan decomposition g = k \u2295 p relative\nto K. We abuse notation and use \u03c01 to denote both the representation of G on F\nand the induced representation of g on F .\nProposition 4.12 ([25], Lemma 3.1). There is an inner product (*, *)F on F which\nsatisfies\n\u2022 (\u03c01 (X)u, v)F = \u2212(u, \u03c01 (X)v)F for X \u2208 k, and\n\u2022 (\u03c01 (X)u, v)F = (u, \u03c01 (X)v)F for X \u2208 p.\nThe first condition means that (*, *)F is invariant under \u03c01 (K).\nSince \u03c02 is a unitary representation of \u0393 on H, each \u03c02 (\u03b3) preserves the Hilbert\nproduct ( , )H on H. We form an inner product on E = F \u2297 H as the tensor product\nof the above two structures. That is, let (a \u2297 c, b \u2297 d)E = (a, b)F * (c, d)H and extend\nlinearly. By the properties in Proposition 4.12, this inner product is clearly invariant\nby the action inducing the quotient Q\u2032 : G \u00d7 E \u2192 E(\u03c3 \u2032 ), and so induces a Euclidean\nstructure on E(\u03c3 \u2032 ) = E(\u03c0) which we denote hereafter by ( , ) and call the canonical\nmetric on E(\u03c0).\n4.4.3. Two linear connections. The principal bundle G \u2192 M carries a natural connection. The subgroup K < G induces a Cartan decomposition g = k \u2295 p of the Lie\nalgebra g of G, where k is the Lie subalgebra corresponding to K. We make a choice of\nhorizontal subspace Hg \u2282 Tg G by Hg = dLg (p), where Lg denotes left multiplication\nby g. This family {Hg }g\u2208G defines a connection in G \u2192 M.\n\n\fSTRENGTHENING (T )\n\n17\n\nThis connection in G \u2192 M induces connections \u2207 and \u2207\u2032 in the vector bundles\nE(\u03c3) and E(\u03c3 \u2032 ). Note that we have associated representations, bundles and connections for all types of tensors over M with values in one of these two bundles by the\nsame methods.\nRecall the computation of such an induced connection ([20] page 116). We state\nthe result for E(\u03c3) but the analogous procedure works for E(\u03c3 \u2032 ). There is a bijective\ncorrespondence between sections f : M \u2192 E(\u03c3) and E-valued functions f \u2217 : G \u2192 E\nsuch that\n(4.9)\n\nf \u2217 (g * (\u03b3, k)) = \u03c3(\u03b3, k)f \u2217(g).\n\nThis correspondence is given in one direction by lifting f to a section of the trivial\nbundle G\u00d7E \u2192 G and taking the second coordinate. Conversely, a function satisfying\nequation 4.9 defines the second coordinate of a section G \u2192 G \u00d7 E which descends\nvia the quotient map Q : G \u00d7 E \u2192 E(\u03c3) since it is \u0393\u00d7K invariant.\nNow we have the following result.\nProposition 4.13. Let f : M \u2192 E(\u03c3) be a section with corresponding function\nf \u2217 : G \u2192 E. Let X be a continuous vector field on M with a horizontal lift X \u2217 to\nG. Then \u2207X f is the section which corresponds to the function X \u2217 f \u2217 = LX \u2217 f \u2217 , where\nLX \u2217 denotes the Lie derivative.\nThis same procedure works for all of the bundles in which we have interest. Note\nthat the two quotient mappings Q, Q\u2032 give rise to different classes of E-valued functions, so we get two distinct connections, \u2207 on E(\u03c3) and \u2207\u2032 on E(\u03c3 \u2032 ). It follows from\nelementary properties of the Lie derivative that these connections are compatible with\nour Euclidean structure.\nAs described in section 4.2 these connections (together with the canonical metric)\ninduce the standard differential operators: exterior differential, Laplacian, and their\nadjoints. We use the standard notations to refer to the objects associated to \u2207 and we\nuse primes to refer to the objects associated to \u2207\u2032 . The following result is immediate\nfrom the definitions.\nLemma 4.14. The exterior differential d on E(\u03c0)-valued p forms associated to \u2207 as\nin section 4.2 is the usual de Rham cohomology coboundary map.\n4.4.4. An explicit formula. We now apply Corollary 4.7 to E(\u03c0) twice, once for each\npair of connection and Laplacian. Taking the difference of the resulting equations\nand recalling the notation of section 4.2, we obtain the following result.\nProposition 4.15. For an E(\u03c0)-valued p-form \u03c3 on M we have that\n\u2217\n\n(\u25b3\u03c3, \u03c3) \u2212 (\u25b3\u2032 \u03c3, \u03c3) = (\u2207\u2217 \u2207\u03c3, \u03c3) \u2212 ((\u2207\u2032 ) \u2207\u2032 \u03c3, \u03c3) + (S(\u03c3) \u2212 S \u2032 (\u03c3), \u03c3).\nOur goal is now to compute workable expressions for the terms on the right hand\nside of this equation in terms of the group G and the representation \u03c0.\n\n\f18\n\nDAVID FISHER AND THERON HITCHMAN\n\nLet \u03b7 be an E(\u03c0)-valued p-form on M. We lift \u03b7 to the corresponding E-valued pform \u03b7 \u2217 on G through the quotient map Q\u2032 . Thus \u03b7 \u2217 satisfies the following properties:\nP\u2013I \u03b7 \u2217 \u25e6 L\u03b3 = (IdF \u2297 \u03c02 (\u03b3))\u03b7 \u2217 for \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393, where L\u03b3 denotes left multiplication,\nP\u2013II i(X)\u03b7 \u2217 = 0 for X \u2208 k,\nP\u2013III \u03b7 \u2217 \u25e6 Rk = (\u03c01 (k)\u22121 \u2297 IdH )\u03b7 \u2217 , for k \u2208 K, where Rk denotes right multiplication,\nand\nP\u2013IV LX \u03b7 \u2217 = (\u2212\u03c01 (X) \u2297 IdH )\u03b7 \u2217 for X \u2208 k, where LX denotes the Lie derivative\nwith respect to X.\nThe fourth property is the linearization of the K-equivariance in property P\u2013III.\nAs usual, we identify elements of the Lie algebra g with left-invariant vector fields\non G. Also, we fix a basis of g as follows. Let N = dim M = dim p and choose a basis\nX1 , . . . , XN of p which is orthonormal with respect to the restriction of the Killing\nform of g to p. Let m = dim k, n = N + m and XN +1 , . . . , Xn be an orthonormal\nbasis of k with respect to the negative of the restriction of the Killing form of g to k.\nLet \u03c9 1 , . . . , \u03c9 n be the 1-forms on G which are dual to the left invariant vector\nfields X1 , . . . , Xn . These are determined by the conditions \u03c9 j (Xi ) = \u03b4ij . Note that\nthis means that for 1 \u2264 k, j \u2264 N, we have Xk \u03c9 j = 0. We choose our locally\nsymmetric metric\nbe normalized so that G\u2192M is a Riemannian submersion\nPnon Mi to\ni\nfor the metric i=1 \u03c9 \u03c9 on G.

This argument should be compared with [25, Proposition 5.1].\nRecall the quotient mappings q : G \u2192 M and Q\u2032 : G \u00d7 E \u2192 E(\u03c3) = E(\u03c0).\nFor y \u2208 G, let Q\u2032y (v) be the point Q\u2032 (y, v) in E(\u03c0). Then v 7\u2192 Q\u2032y (v) is a linear\nisomorphism of E onto the fiber E(\u03c0)q(y) . So for each point y \u2208 G and any tangent\nvectors Z1 , . . . , Zp to G at y we have\n\u03b7y\u2217 (Z1 , . . . , Zp ) = Q\u2032y\n\n\u22121\n\n\u03b7q(y) (q\u2217 Z1 , . . . , q\u2217 Zp ).\n\nIn particular, this means that\nX\n\u22121\n\u03b7i\u03b11 ,...,ip \u2297 v\u03b1 = Q\u2032y \u03b7q(y) (q\u2217 Xi1 , . . . , q\u2217 Xip ).\n\u03b1\u2208A\n\nNow fix y \u2208 G and let x = q(y) \u2208 M.

It is essential for all\nof our computations that no terms arise from the \"flat, Hilbertian\" part of either\nF \u2297H bundle over M. The quotient map q : G \u2192 M decomposes as q = q1 \u25e6 q2 where\nq2 : G \u2192 \u0393\\G and q1 : \u0393\\G \u2192 M. As noted Ras [25, Lemma 5.3],\nR with our conventions,\nif f is a continuous function on M, then M f dvolM = c \u0393\\G f \u25e6 q1 dvol\u0393\\G . By\nR\nR\nlifting one more step up through q2 we obtain that M f dvolM = c D f \u25e6 q dvolG . A\nsimple application of this last equation to equation 4.10 completes the proof of the\nProposition.\n\u0003\nWe now compute the terms on the right hand side of 4.15 in terms of the functions\n\u03b7i\u03b11 ,...,ip . We begin by working with the connection in E(\u03c3 \u2032 ).\nFix y in G, and let x = q(y) = \u0393yK \u2208 M. The vectors X1 (y), . . . , XN (y) project\nto an orthonormal basis {q\u2217 Xi (y)} of Tx M. On a sufficiently small neighborhood\nU of x in M, we extend this basis to a synchronous framing {Yi } over U such that\nYi (x) = q\u2217 Xi (y), \u2207Yj Yi (x) = 0, and (Yj , Yk ) = \u03b4jk on U. Recall that such a framing\nis constructed by parallel transport of the frame {q\u2217 Xi (y)} radially outward from x\nalong geodesics.\nLet \u03b8i be the basis for ordinary 1-forms on U which is dual to the framing {Yi }.\nThat is, at each point of U, \u03b8i (Yj ) = \u03b4ji . Note that this means that the \u03b8i 's form an\northonormal basis for the 1-forms on U. As above, we decompose \u03b7 in terms of this\nbasis.\nX\nai1 ,...,ip \u2297 \u03b8i1 \u2227 . . . \u2227 \u03b8ip .\n\u03b7=\ni1 <...<ip\n\n\fSTRENGTHENING (T )\n\n21\n\nSo we compute\nX\n\u2207Yk ai1 ,...,ip \u2297 \u03b8i1 \u2227 . . . \u2227 \u03b8ip\n\u2207Y k \u03b7 =\ni1 <...<ip\n\np\nX X\n\n+\n\nai1 ,...,ip \u2297 \u03b8i1 \u2227 . . . \u2227 \u2207Yk \u03b8is \u2227 . . . \u2227 \u03b8ip .\n\ni1 <...<ip s=1\n\nNote that because we are working in a synchronous frame, we have\n\u2207Yk \u03b8i (x) = 0,\n\nfor all i and k.\n\nHence the second sum vanishes and we need to compute \u2207Yk ai1 ,...,ip (x).\nSince ai1 ,...,ip is a section of E(\u03c3) we may use the Lie derivative description from\nsection 4.4.3.

The assignment t 7\u2192 y exp(tXk (e)) is easily checked to be such a\ncurve. In fact, this curve is horizontal since \u03b3 \u2032 (t) \u2208 H\u03b3(t) for all t. So by the definition\nof parallel translation, we see that\nYi\u2217 (\u03b3(t)) = Xi (\u03b3(t)).\nThis gives that, at a point \u03b3(t), \u03c9 jr (Yi\u2217r ) = \u03b4ijrr and hence along \u03b3(t) we have\nYk\u2217 (\u03c9 js (Yi\u2217s )) = 0.\nUsing this and that Yi\u2217 (y) = Xi (y), we see that\nX\nXk \u03b7i\u03b11 ,...,ip \u2297 v\u03b1 .\nL(y) = Xk (y)a\u2217i1 ,...,ip (y) =\n\u03b1\u2208A\n\nFrom this argument, we deduce the following lemma.\n\n\f22\n\nDAVID FISHER AND THERON HITCHMAN\n\nLemma 4.17. \u2207\u2032Yk \u03b7\n\n\u0001\u03b1\n\ni1 ,...,ip\n\n(y) = Xk \u03b7i\u03b11 ,...,ip (y)\n\nOur next step is to compute the adjoint of \u2207\u2032Yk at y.

As much is the same,\nwe highlight differences and state results.\nThe main difference is that to use the Lie derivative description of \u2207 one must\ninstead lift into the bundle E(\u03c3), while the functions \u03b7i\u03b11 ,...,ip are lifts into E(\u03c3 \u2032 ).

Horizontal lifts of vectors tangent to M\nare performed in exactly the same way, so no change is required on this point.\nWe pull functions back by A, take their appropriate Lie derivatives and push forward by A.

It is not difficult to check that this is symmetric with\nrespect to Ip , so all of its eigenvalues are real.\nProposition 4.27. To check the hypothesis of Proposition 4.8, it suffices to show\nthat the quadratic form\n\u03b8 \u2192 Ip (T\u03c0p1 \u03b8, \u03b8)\non Rp is positive definite.\nProof. Since Rp is finite dimensional, positive-definiteness is equivalent to having all\nthe eigenvalues of T\u03c0p1 positive. Then one can choose C to be the minimal eigenvalue\nof T\u03c0p1 and obtain Ip (T\u03c0p1 \u03b8, \u03b8) \u2265 C * Ip (\u03b8, \u03b8) for every \u03b8 \u2208 Rp . It is important to note\nthat C depends only upon p and \u03c01 .\nFor each y \u2208 G and for each \u03b1 \u2208 A, we think of \u03b7y\u03b1 as an element of Rp .

Denote by \u03c01 also the induced representation of g on F . Let \u03c0 i = \u03c01|gi , and let \u039bi\nbe the highest weight of the extension of \u03c0 i to a representation of giC on FC = F \u2297R C.\nLet \u0393 be an irreducible cocompact lattice in G, and let \u03c02 be a non-trivial unitary\nrepresentation of \u0393 on a separable Hilbert space H.

The main point is\nto subtract the two versions of equation 4.4 rather than the two versions of equation\n4.5. The first point is that the left hand sides of equation 4.4 cancel, since the\nLaplacians on functions defined by our two connections are equal. Once one observes\nthat, it is easy to see that all of the computations in \u00a74.2 and \u00a74.4.5 yield pointwise\nformulas. This is explicit in the statements of most of the lemmas above and easy to\ncheck in the remaining cases.\n4.4.6. Vanishing in higher degrees. We obtain results for vanishing in higher degrees\nin the case where \u03c01 is a representation on a complex vector space F using the\ncomputations in [30, 32]. Note that none of the development in sections \u00a74.1 through\n\u00a74.4.5 depends upon whether F is a real or complex space. The only change is that\nRp is a complex vector space and Ip is a Hermitian product.\nTo state the result we introduce some more notation. Let \u03b8 denote the Cartan\ninvolution of g associated to k, as well as its extension to gC . Let pC be the orthogonal\ncomplement of kC with respect to the Killing form \u03ba of gC . Let hk be a Cartan\nsubalgebra of k, and h \u2283 hk a Cartan subalgebra of g. Let hC (respectively hkC ) be\nthe C-span of h (respectively hk).\nLet \u2206 be the root system of gC with respect to hC . For \u03b1 \u2208 \u2206, let H\u03b1 P\nbe the unique\nelement of hC such that \u03ba(H, H\u03b1 ) = \u03b1(H) for all H \u2208 HC . Let h\u2217 = \u03b1\u2208\u2206 RH\u03b1 =\nihkC \u2295 (hC \u222a pC ). We partition the set of roots \u2206 into three subsets. Let\nA = {\u03b1 \u2208 \u2206 | \u03b8(E\u03b1 ) = E\u03b1 }\nB\n= {\u03b1 \u2208 \u2206 | \u03b8(\u03b1) 6= \u03b1}\nC = {\u03b1 \u2208 \u2206 | \u03b8(E\u03b1 ) = \u2212E\u03b1 },\n\nwhere E\u03b1 denotes a root vector corresponding to \u03b1. Then we have that \u2206 = A\u222aB \u222aC,\n\u03b8 stabilizes the sets hC , A \u222a C and B, and \u03b8(\u03b1) = \u03b1 if \u03b1 \u2208 A \u222a C.\nFollowing Raghunathan, we say that an ordering on the real dual of h\u2217 is admissible\nwhen it is described by the following process: Let H1 , . . . , Hm be an orthonormal basis\nof h\u2217 chosen so that the initial elements H1 , . . . , Hl form a basis of ihk, and declare\nthat \u03b1 in the real dual of h\u2217 is positive if the first nonvanishing \u03b1Hi is positive. If\nO is an admissible order, then for a finite subset E of the dual of h\u2217 we shall write\nE + (O) for the subset of positive elements in E.\nNow, for an irreducible representation \u03c0 of G, let \u039b\u03c0 (O) denote the highest weight\nof \u03c0 with respect to the order O. Let \u03a32 (O) = C + (O) \u222a {\u03b1 \u2208 B + (O) | \u03b1 > \u03b8(\u03b1)}\nand \u03a3\u03c0 (O) = {\u03b1 \u2208 \u03a32 (O) | \u03ba(\u039b\u03c0 (O), \u03b1) 6= 0}. With all of this notation, we can now\nstate the following result.\n\n\fSTRENGTHENING (T )\n\n29\n\nTheorem 4.31 (Raghunathan [32, 29]). Let \u03c0 be an irreducible finite dimensional\nrepresentation of G. Then if \u03a3\u03c0 (O) contains (strictly) more than q elements for every\nadmissible O, then the Hermitian quadratic form \u03b7 7\u2192 Ip (T\u03c0p \u03b7, \u03b7) is positive definite\nfor p \u2264 q.\nThe same line of argument as above allows us to deduce the following result.\nTheorem 4.32. Assume the notations and hypotheses of Theorems 4.29 and 4.30,\nwith the exceptions that F is a complex vector space and \u03c01 is a complex linear representation, and \u0393 is torsion free. If Raghunathan's condition on admissible orders is\nsatisfied, then for each 1 \u2264 p \u2264 q there is a constant Cp such that every E(\u03c1)-valued\np-form \u03b7 on M satisfies\n(\u25b3\u03b7, \u03b7) \u2265 Cp (\u03b7, \u03b7).\nFurthermore, H p (\u0393, \u03c1) = 0 for 1 \u2264 p \u2264 q. This last assertion holds even if \u0393 contains\nelements of finite order.\n4.5. Direct Computation of the flat Laplacian. As it will be useful for the\ndiscussion to follow in \u00a75, we now give a more direct computation of the Laplacian\n\u25b3 associated to the flat connection \u2207. The main point is that we may realize the\naction of the Laplacian as the action of the Casimir operator of our Lie algebra on\nthe family of functions \u03b7i\u03b11 ,...,ip . To do so, we continue with the notations and setup of\nthis section. In particular, we make use of Lemma 4.21.\nRecall that the exterior differential d may be defined as the anti-symmetrization of\nthe connection. So for our E(\u03c1)-valued p form \u03b7 on M and vector fields Z1 , . . . , Zp+1\non M we have\n(d\u03b7)(Z1 , . . . , Zp+1 ) =\n\np+1\nX\n\n(\u22121)i+1 (\u2207Zi \u03b7)(Z1 , . . . , \u1e90i , . . . , Zp+1).\n\ni=1\n\nSo, in terms of the family of functions we have defined above, using Lemma 4.21, we\nsee that\n(d\u03b7)\u03b1i1,...,ip+1\n\n=\n\np+1\nX\n\n(\u22121)k+1 (Xik + \u03c01 (Xik ))\u03b7i\u03b11 ,...,i\u02c6k ,...,ip+1 .\n\nk=1\n\nA simple argument (using Weil's integration by parts (equation 4.11) and the fact\nthat \u03c01 (X) is symmetric with respect to the inner product on F for X \u2208 p (Lemma\n4.12)) computes the adjoint of d to be as follows.\nLemma 4.33.

Obstructions to the approach via relative Lie algebra\ncohomology\nIn this section, we outline briefly what would be required to pursue an approach\nto our results via relative Lie algebra cohomology (also called (g, K)-cohomology).\nWe first discuss direct approaches for connected groups, and then turn to using Matsushima's formula for cocompact lattices.\n5.1. Connected Groups. Given the fact, mentioned following Theorem 1.2, that\nvanishing of H 1 (G, \u03c0\u2297\u03c02 , F \u2297 H) is known for \u03c02 irreducible or admissible, it is\nperhaps surprising that one cannot deduce Theorem 1.2 from this. We describe the\nscheme when \u03c02 is an infinite direct sum, the case of direct integrals is essentially the\nsame. If we have (\u03c02 , H) = (\u2295i \u03c02i , \u2295Hi ) then:\nH 1(G, \u03c01 \u2297\u03c02 , F \u2297H) =\n\n\u2295i Z1 (G, \u03c01 \u2297 \u03c02i , F \u2297Hi )\n,\n\u2295i B1 (G, \u03c01 \u2297 \u03c02i , F \u2297Hi )\n\nwhere we know that the natural map B1 (G, \u03c01 \u2297 \u03c02i , F \u2297Hi ) \u2192 Z1 (G, \u03c01 \u2297 \u03c02i , F \u2297Hi )\nhas an inverse pi for every i. It is straightforward to check that vanishing of the group\nH 1 (D, \u03c01 \u2297\u03c02 , F \u2297H) is equivalent to a uniform bound on the norms of all pi .\nThe existing proofs that cohomology vanishes for \u03c02 admissible use quite involved\nhomological arguments first to translate the question to one of relative Lie algebra\ncohomology and then to prove vanishing of relative Lie algebra cohomology. It is not\nclear that the required bound can be produced by this method.\nOne can try to bound pi a posteriori by direct computation, using that G has\nproperty (T ) and that \u03c01 is fixed. This direction does not seem fruitful.\n5.2. Lattices. We now discuss the possibility of a proof for cocompact lattices using\n(an extension of) Matsushima's formula, a topic on which we are more optimistic.\nThough it has a different guise here than above, the problem is again one of uniformity\nof estimates. For this section let G be any semisimple Lie group with finite center.\nFor \u03c0 : \u0393\u2192GL(F ) any finite dimensional representation which almost extends to G,\nMatsushima's formula [24] says:\nM\n(5.1)\nH k (\u0393, F ) =\nn\u03c0 H k (g, k, V\u03c0,0 \u2297F ),\n\nwhere the sum is over the irreducible G representations \u03c0 appearing in L2 (G/\u0393) and\nV\u03c0,0 is the space of K-finite vectors in the representation space V\u03c0 for \u03c0. The Hodge\ntheorem and/or more formal variants are used in the course of the proof. In particular, the isomorphism in equation 5.1 above is deduced by computing cohomology by\ncomputing harmonic forms.\nIn proofs of Matsushima's formula, there is a step at which there is no isomorphism at the level of chain complexes, but only an isomorphism between spaces of\nthe harmonic forms in the two complexes. In geometric language, the transition is\nbetween computing cohomology using the complex of smooth forms and computing\n\n\f32\n\nDAVID FISHER AND THERON HITCHMAN\n\ncohomology using the complex of L2 forms. Since L2 harmonic forms are smooth, for\nfinite dimensional vector bundles, the Hodge theorem implies that one can compute\ncohomology by computing the space of L2 harmonic forms. The passage to L2 forms\nis important since it allows one to bring to bear various results from representation\ntheory in the computations. For a clear general exposition of Matsushima's formula,\nsee section 2 of Schmid's article [34].\nSince the Hodge theorem fails in general for infinite dimensional vector bundles, it\nis no longer possible in our context to compute cohomology using harmonic forms.\nHowever, we can produce a formula along the lines of Matsushima's result which\ncontrols the allowable harmonic forms in our more general bundle.\nLet G be a semisimple Lie group, \u0393 < G a cocompact lattice and \u03c0 a finite dimensional by unitary representation of \u0393. To avoid discussion of direct integrals, we\nassume that the unitary representation \u03c02 is irreducible. Let Hk (\u0393, \u03c0, F \u2297H) be the\nspace of smooth harmonic k forms in the bundle \u0393\\(G/K\u00d7\u03c0 F \u2297H). Following the\nproof of Matsushima's formula (with equation 4.22 in place of Matsushima's computation of the similar object), we obtain an isomorphism:\nM\n(5.2)\nHk (\u0393, \u03c0, F \u2297H) =\nn\u03b7 H k (g, k, V\u03b7,0 \u2297F ),\n\nwhere the sum is over the irreducible G representations \u03b7 appearing in I\u0393G (\u03c02 ) and V\u03b7,0\nis the space of K-finite vectors in the representation space V\u03b7 for \u03b7. The expression\nabove is correct because H k (g, k, V\u03c0,0\u2297F ) can be computed as the cohomology of\na finite dimensional complex where a Hodge theorem is available for purely formal\nreasons.\nCombined with the theorem of Borel-Wallach, Zuckerman and Schmid (precisely,\nthe statement of [34, Theorem 2.13]), equation 5.2 implies that H1 (\u0393, \u03c0, F \u2297H) = 0\nin the situation of Theorem 3.1, so it is possible to control the part of the cohomology\nwhich consists of harmonic forms.\nIt should be possible to give an alternate proof of Theorem 3.1 using an argument\nclose to the one given by Mok in [26]. We briefly sketch the idea to point out the\ndifficulties. Given a bundle where an estimate of the type proven in Theorem 4.8 fails,\nMok's idea is to take a sequence of forms with < \u25b3fi , fi >\u2192 0 and kfi k2 = 1 and use a\nrenormalizing and limiting argument to construct another bundle over \u0393\\G/K where\nthere are non-vanishing harmonic forms. Mok does this for flat bundles associated\nto unitary representations, and shows that the bundle constructed in the limit has\nthe same form. In order to have a result applicable in our setting, we would need\nto repeat Mok's argument with a flat bundles associated to a finite dimensional by\nunitary representation and prove that the limiting representation is finite dimensional\nby unitary. We believe this is possible and hope to pursue it in a later paper, where\nwe would also give a detailed account of equation 5.2 and it's generalizations. These\ntwo results would imply better vanishing results for higher degree cohomology than\nthose in \u00a74.4.6. In fact, in combination with results of Vogan-Zuckerman, we expect\n\n\fSTRENGTHENING (T )\n\n33\n\nthis will yield optimal vanishing theorems for higher degree cohomology of cocompact\nlattices [39]. However, due to the failure of Lemma 3.9 for H k when k > 1, this will\nnot yield vanishing theorems for the ambient group.\n\nReferences\n1.
