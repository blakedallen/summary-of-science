Based on the astrophysical data, the surface magnetic field of a neutron star is\nH \u223c 1011 \u2212 1013 G, and the internal field can reach H \u223c 1015 G or even higher [1]-[3]. As was shown by BisnovatiKogan [4], the presence of rotation of stars may increase the magnetic field by an additional factor of 103 \u2212 104 .\nIn such strong magnetic fields, it is expected that the thermodynamic properties and wave dynamics in degenerate\nplasmas would be quite different governed by the quantum effects. This is true when the characteristic energy of\nelectron on a Landau level reaches the nonrelativistic limit of the electron chemical potential \u03bc = \u03b5F = h\u0304|e|H\n2me c , i.e.\nv2\n\nm2 c 3\n\n1/3\n\ne\n= 4.4 * 1013 G is the Schwinger's magnetic field, vF = pF /me = (3\u03c0 2 )1/3 h\u0304ne /me is\nH = HS cF2 , where HS = |e|h\u0304\nthe speed of electrons at the Fermi surface, h\u0304 is the Planck constant divided by 2\u03c0, me is the electron rest mass, c is\nthe speed of light in vacuum and | e | is the magnitude of the electron charge.\nAs is well known, the strong magnetic field in the Fermion gas leads to two magnetic effects [5]. Namely, they\nare the Pauli paramagnetism due to the spin of electrons and the Landau diamagnetism due to the quantization of\nthe orbital motion of the electrons. We should note here that Klimontovich and Silin [7] have derived the Wigner's\ntype of non-relativistic quantum kinetic equation for a plasma, and in the linear approximation obtained dispersion\nrelations for longitudinal plasma waves and transverse electromagnetic waves, but they did not take into account the\nquantization of the orbital motion of electrons and the spin of electrons. It is also well known that in the classical\nlimit the propagation of longitudinal wave along a magnetic field is unaffected by the magnetic field.\nIn this Letter, we show that the situation radically changes in a quantum plasma when the Landau diamagnetism\nand the Pauli paramagnetism are incorporated, by considering a special case of propagation of linear longitudinal\nwaves along the homogeneous and time independent magnetic field.\n\nII.\n\nSOME THERMODYNAMICAL QUANTITIES\n\nWe first calculate the thermodynamical quantities in the presence of a magnetic field. In a strong magnetic field H,\nas is known the motion in a plane perpendicular to the magnetic field is quantized [5], and the electron energy levels\n\u03b5l,\u03c3\nare determined in the non-relativistic limit by the expression\ne\n\u03b5l,\u03c3\ne =\n\np2z\n+ (2l + 1 + \u03c3)\u03b2H ,\n2me\n\n(1)\n\n|e|h\u0304\nwhere pz is the electron momentum in the z-direction, \u03b2 = 2m\nis the Bohr magneton, \u03c3 is the operator the\nec\nz component of which describes the spin orientation ~s = 12 ~\u03c3 (\u03c3 = \u00b11), and l is the orbital quantum number\n(l = 0, 1, 2, ...).\nFrom the expression (1) one sees that the energy spectrum of electrons consist of the lowest Landau level, l = 0,\n\u03c3 = \u22121, and pairs of degenerate levels with opposite polarization, \u03c3 = 1. Thus each value with l 6= 0 occurs twice,\n\n\u2217 Also\n\nat Department of Plasma Physics, E.Andronikashvii Institute of Physics, Tbilisi, Georgia\n\n\f2\nand that with l = 0 once. Therefore, \u03b5l,\u03c3\ne can be rewritten as\nl\n\u03b5l,\u03c3\ne = \u03b5e =\n\np2\np2z\n+ 2l\u03b2H = z + lh\u0304\u03c9c ,\n2me\n2me\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03c9c = |e|H\nme c is the cyclotron frequency of the electron.\nThe number of quantum states [5] of a particle moving in a volume V and the interval dpz for any value of l is\nV \u03b5F \u03b1 \u03b7\u03b1 m\u03b1 dpz\n2V | e | Hdpz\n=\n,\n(2\u03c0h\u0304)2 c\n2\u03c0 2 h\u03043\n\n(3)\n\np2\n\nF\u03b1\nc\u03b1\nwhere suffix \u03b1 stands for the particle species, \u03b7\u03b1 = h\u0304\u03c9\n\u03b5F \u03b1 and \u03b5F \u03b1 = 2m\u03b1 . Note that for the degenerate particles\n\u03b7\u03b1 = \u03b7 does not depend on the mass of particles.\nThe equilibrium total density of particles is defined as\n\u221e Z\nm\u03b1 \u03b5 F \u03b1 \u03b7 X \u221e\nn\u03b1 =\ndpz f\u03b1 (pz , l) ,\n(4)\n2\u03c0 2 h\u03043 l=0 \u2212\u221e\n\nwhere f\u03b1 (pz , l) is the Fermi distribution function\n1\n\nf\u03b1 (pz , l) =\nexp\n\n(\n\np2\nz\n2m\u03b1\n\n+lh\u0304\u03c9c\u03b1 \u2212\u03bc\u03b1\nT\u03b1\n\n)\n\n,\n\n(5)\n\n+1\n\n\u03bc\u03b1 being the chemical potential.\nTo evaluate the density n\u03b1 from the expression (4), we shall consider a plasma at the temperature limit | lh\u0304\u03c9c\u03b1 \u2212\n\u03bc\u03b1 |\u226b T\u03b1 . In this case the Fermi distribution function is in a good approximation described by the Heaviside step\nfunction H(\u03bc\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b5l\u03b1 ), which equals 1 for \u03bc\u03b1 = \u03b5F \u03b1 \u2265 \u03b5l\u03b1 and zero for \u03b5F \u03b1 < \u03b5l\u03b1 . We also note here that the maximum\nof l should be lmax = 1/\u03b7, since pz = pF \u03b1 (1 \u2212 l\u03b7)1/2 is real.\nLet us recall some purely quantum mechanical features of a macroscopic system. It is well known that there is\nan extremely high density of levels in the energy eigenvalue spectrum of a macroscopic system. We know also that\nthe number of levels in a given finite range of the energy spectrum of a macroscopic system increases exponentially\nwith the number of particles N in the system, and separations between levels are given by numbers of the 10\u2212N .\nTherefore we can conclude that in such case the spectrum is almost continuous, and a quasi-classical approximation\nRl\nPl\nis applicable. Thus, we can replace the summation in Eq.(4) by an integration ( 1max \u2192 1 max dl) to obtain after a\nsimple integration an expression of the density n\u03b1 . The result is\n\u001a\n\u001b\n2\np3\nn\u03b1 = F2 \u03b1 3 \u03b7 + (1 \u2212 \u03b7)3/2 .\n(6)\n3\n2\u03c0 h\u0304\nIn equation (6) the first term is the contribution from the lowest Landau level (l = 0), i.e. this term is associated\nwith the Pauli paramagnetism and self-energy of particles. The second one results from the summation over all higher\nLandau levels.\nIf the magnetic field is absent (\u03b7 = 0), then for the density we get the well known expression\nn\u03b1|\u03b7=0 =\n\np3F \u03b1\n.\n3\u03c0 2 h\u03043\n\n(7)\n\nWhereas, if the magnetic field is very strong \u03b7 > 1, the sum in Eq.(4) vanishes and all electrons are at the main level,\nwhich means that the gas is fully polarized and spins of all particles are aligned opposite to the magnetic field. Hence,\nin this case for the density we have\nn\u03b1 =\n\np3F \u03b1\n\u03b7.\n2\u03c0 2 h\u03043\n\n(8)\n\nWe now use Eq.(6) to write the limiting Fermi energy and the degenerate temperature as\n2/3\n\n\u03b5F \u03b1 = T F \u03b1 =\n\n(2\u03c0 2 )2/3 h\u03042 n\u03b1\np2F \u03b1\n=\n\b\n2m\u03b1\n2m\u03b1 \u03b7 + 32 (1 \u2212 \u03b7)3/2\n\n2/3\n\n.\n\n(9)\n\n\f3\nIn the case when \u03b7 > 1, Eq.(9) reduces to\nTF \u03b1 =\n\n(2\u03c0 2 )2/3 h\u03042 \u0010 n\u03b1 \u00112/3\n,\n2m\u03b1\n\u03b7\n\n(10)\n\nwhich reads that the degenerate temperature for the given n\u03b1 is reverse dependent on the magnetic field.\nNoting the relation \u03b7 = h\u0304\u03c9c /\u03b5F equation (10) can be rewritten in the form\nTF e = \u03b3\nwhere\n\u03b3=\n\n\u0010 n \u00112\nH\n\n,\n\n(11)\n\n\u03c0 4 h\u03044 c2\n.\n2me e2\n\nThe condition for an ideal gas is that the energy of the Coulomb interaction between electrons and ions is of the\norder of Ze2 /r0 , where Ze is the ion charge and r0 \u223c (Z/n)1/3 is the mean distance between the electrons and ions,\nand this energy should be small in comparison with the mean kinetic energy of the electrons (9) or (10). In the case\n\u03b7 < 1, this condition \u03b5F \u226b Ze2 /r0 yields\nn\u226b\n\n\u001b2\n\u0010 2m e2 \u00113 \u001a\n2\ne\n2\n3/2\n\u03b7\n+\nZ\n.\n(1\n\u2212\n\u03b7)\n3\n(2\u03c0)2/3 h\u03042\n\n(12)\n\nIn the opposite case \u03b7 > 1, using Eq.(11) we obtain\nn\u226b\n\n\u0010 e2 \u00113/5\n\nn\u226b\n\n\u0010\n\n\u03b3\n\nZ 2/5 H 6/5 .\n\n(13)\n\nFinally, in the case \u03b7 = 0 (H=0) we have [5]\n\nIII.\n\n2me e2 \u00113 2\nZ .\n(3\u03c0 2 )2/3 h\u03042\n\nLONGITUDINAL PLASMA WAVES\n\nWe now consider a spectra of longitudinal waves of a strongly magnetized spatially homogeneous collisionless plasma\nin thermodynamic equilibrium, supposing that electrons are degenerate, but not ions. Namely, the equilibrium\ndistribution function for the electrons is assumed to be the step function (6) (in the limit Te = 0 or TF \u226b Te ).\nWhereas the ions are unmagnetized and the equilibrium distribution function for them is Maxwellian. As in the\nprevious section, in the distribution function of electrons we take into account the quantization of the orbital motion\nof the electrons in the expression of energy.\nThe magnetic field is assumed to be directed along the z-axis and the longitudinal wave propagates in the same\ndirection.

It should be emphasized that the dispersion equation (23) is general (in the one-dimensional case), which\ndescribes high-frequency oscillations of electrons, as well as branch of ion spectrum.\nLet us now discuss some special cases. We first consider a high-frequency longitudinal waves neglecting the contribution of ions, and show that the magnetic field is responsible for new modes of quantum plasma waves.\nIn the case of strong magnetic field, i.e. \u03b7 > 1, the sum in Eq.(22) vanishes and all electrons are at the Landau\nground level (l = 0), which means that the electron gas is fully polarized. Using the expression of the electron density\n(8), from Eq.(22) we then get the dispersion equation\n\u03c9 2 = \u03c9p2 + \u03c9q2 + k 2 vF2 ,\n\n(25)\n\np\nwhere \u03c9p = 4\u03c0e2 n0e /me and n0e is defined by Eq.(8). We specifically note here that all terms in Eq.(25) can be\nthe same order, or even kvF > \u03c9p . It should be also emphasized that this spectra (25) is a new branch of frequencies\ndue to the quantization of the orbital momentum of electrons.\n\u221a\nNext in the case when h\u0304\u03c9ce < \u03b5F = p2F /2me , i.e. \u03b7 < 1, noting that in the range of frequencies \u03c9 > kvF 1 \u2212 \u03b7 the\nroots of Eq.(23) are real, we obtain the spectra of quantum Langmuir electron waves in the presence of magnetic field\n\u001b\n\u001a\n\u03b7(1 + 34 \u03bb2B \u03bb2T F k 4 )\n1\n2 2\n2\n2\n2\n2 2\n.\n(26)\n3k \u03bbT F +\n\u03c9 = \u03c9p + \u03c9q + k vF\n1 + 43 \u03bb2B \u03bb2T F k 4 + 3k 2 \u03bbT F\n\u03b7 + 23 (1 \u2212 \u03b7)3/2\n\u221a\nHere we have introduced the Thomas-Fermi screening length \u03bbT F = vF / 3\u03c9p and de Broglie wavelength \u03bbB = h\u0304/pF .\nAs is well known in the classical plasma at the electron temperature larger than that of the ions a slowly damping\nion waves and the Langmuir electron waves can simultaneously propagate. In the quantum plasma one should also\nexpect the existence of the ion waves. In order to demonstrate this, we consider an intermediate wave range where\nthe phase velocity satisfies the inequality\np\n\u03c9\nvtri \u226a \u226a vF 1 \u2212 \u03b7 .\n(27)\nk\nIn this case one assumes that the characteristic dimension R of inhomogeneities in the plasma is larger than the\nelectron Thomas-Fermi length \u03bbT F . So, for \u03bbT F \u226a R we further assume that the quasi neutrality\nne = ni\n\n(28)\n\nis satisfied, and we treat ions as cold. With this assumption Eq.(23) admits the complex roots (\u03c9 = \u03c9 \u2032 + i\u03c9 \u2032\u2032 ) such as\n\u001b\n\u0010\n\u0011\u001am\n2\nk 2 vF2\n3 h\u03042 k 4\ne\n\u221a\n\u03c9 \u20322 = \u03b7 + (1 \u2212 \u03b7)3/2\n(29)\n+\n3\nmi \u03b7 + 2 1 \u2212 \u03b7\n2 4mi me\nand the imaginary part\n\u03c9 \u2032\u2032 = \u2212\n\n\u03b7 + 32 (1 \u2212 \u03b7)3/2\n\u03c0 me\n\u221a\nkvF\n.\n4 mi\n\u03b7+2 1\u2212\u03b7\n\n(30)\n\nWe note here that in the absence of the magnetic field \u03b7 = 0 the expressions (29) and (30) converge to the equations\n(26) and (27) of Ref.[8].\nWe now study the case when the phase velocity of low frequency waves satisfies the following conditions\np\n\u03c9\n\u03c9\nand\n\u226b vF 1 \u2212 \u03b7 .\nvtri \u226a \u226a vF\n(31)\nk\nk\n\nThe second inequality of (31) indicates that the cyclotron energy h\u0304\u03c9ce is rather close to the limiting Fermi energy\n\u03b5F , or \u03b7 \u223c 1. This branch of the oscillation spectrum has very weak damping when the ion temperature is small in\ncomparison with the electron degeneracy temperature\nTi < TF .\n\n(32)\n\n\f6\nWith the inequalities (31) at hand, from the dispersion relation (23) for the longest waves k\u03bbT F \u226a 1 we obtain the\nreal\n)\n(\nme \u03b7 + 32 (1 \u2212 \u03b7)3/2 2 2\n\u20322\n2\n(33)\n\u03c9 =\nk vF + \u03c9q\nmi\n\u03b7\nand the imaginary part of \u03c9, which defines the damping rate\nr\n\u0010\n\u03c92 \u0011\n\u03c0 \u03c9 \u20324\n\u2032\u2032\nexp\n\u2212\n.\n\u03c9 =\u2212\n3\n2\n8 k 3 vtri\n2k 2 vtri\n\n(34)\n\nNote that in this case the contribution of electrons to \u03c9 \u2032\u2032 is zero. So that the damping is due to the ions alone.\nIt should be emphasized that the expressions (33) and (34) are novel, and exist only if one takes into account the\nLandau quantization.\nIV.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nWe have investigated the effects of the quantization of the orbital motion of electrons and the spin of electrons\non the propagation of longitudinal waves in a quantum plasma. It is well known that in the classical approximation\nthe propagation of longitudinal wave along a magnetic field is unaffected by the magnetic field. We found that the\nsituation radically changes in a quantum plasma when the Landau diamagnetism and the Pauli paramagnetism are\ntaken into account. Namely, we derived a novel dispersion equation of the longitudinal wave propagating along the\nhomogeneous and time independent magnetic field, which contains all the information on the quantum effects and\nexhibits the strong dependence on the magnetic field. Studying this dispersion relation we have disclosed new modes of\nquantum plasma waves. These investigations may play an essential role for the description of complex phenomena that\nappear in dense astrophysical objects, as well as in the next generation intense laser-solid density plasma experiments.\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n\nJ.Landstreet, Phys.
