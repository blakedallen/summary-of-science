A large portion of the theory has been dealing with the\nanalogue of Radon measures. Among the invariants of algebraic topology\nit is K theory which is easiest to adapt to the framework of C \u2217 algebras.\nThe study of the analogue of a differentiable structure on the locally compact space X was proposed in [6] as the investigation of derivations of\na C \u2217 algebra A. In this note we shall develop the basic notions of differential topology in the special case where the differential structure is\nobtained through a Lie group G of automorphisms of A. We extend the\nnotions of connection on a bundle, of curvature and Chern classes and\nconstruct, given a G-invariant trace \u03c4 , a morphism ch\u03c4 from K0 (A) to\nHR\u2217 (G), (the cohomology of left invariant differential forms on G). We\n\u2217 This paper appeared in March 1980 as A. Connes, C \u2217 alg\u00e8bres et g\u00e9om\u00e9trie differentielle.\nC.R. Acad. Sci. Paris, Ser. A-B , 290, 1980.\n\n1\n\n\fthen extend the Atiyah-Singer index theorem. All this study is motivated\nby a simple example, that of the irrational rotation C \u2217 algebra A\u03b8 of angle\n\u03b8. This algebra is highly noncommutative, being simple and non type I,\nand Pimsner and Voiculescu computed K(A\u03b8 ) [3]. We first endow A\u03b8 with\nthe differential structure coming from the obvious action of the compact\ngroup T2 , T = {z \u2208 C, |z| = 1}, we then show that the space of smooth\n(C \u221e ) sections of the vector bundle of dimension \u03b8 on A\u03b8 is identical with\nthe Schwartz space S(R), on which A\u03b8 acts by finite difference operators.\nThe following operators\nD1 f =\n\nd\nf\ndt\n\nand\n\nD2 f =\n\n2 \u03c0 it\nf\n\u03b8\n\nthen define a connection (of constant curvature 1/\u03b8) and the index theorem allows to compute the index (integer valued) of polynomials in D1 ,\nD2 with finite difference operators as coefficients.\nLet (A, G, \u03b1) be a C \u2217 dynamical system, where G is a Lie group.\nWe shall say that x \u2208 A is of C \u221e class iff the map g 7\u2192 \u03b1g (x) from\nG to the normed space A is C \u221e . The involutive algebra A\u221e = {x \u2208\nA, x of class C \u221e } is norm dense in A.\nLet \u039e\u221e be a finite projective module on A\u221e , (we shall write it as a\nright module) ; \u039e0 = \u039e\u221e \u2297A\u221e A is then a finite projective module on A.\nLemma 1 For every finite projective module \u039e on A, there exists a finite\nprojective module \u039e\u221e on A\u221e , unique up to isomorphism, such that \u039e is\nisomorphic to \u039e\u221e \u2297A\u221e A.\nIn the sequel we let \u039e\u221e be a finite projective module on A\u221e . An\nhermitian structure on \u039e\u221e is given by a positive hermitian form h\u03be, \u03b7i \u2208\nA\u221e , \u2200 \u03be, \u03b7 \u2208 \u039e\u221e such that\nh\u03be * x, \u03b7 * yi = y \u2217 h\u03be, \u03b7i x ,\n\n\u2200 \u03be, \u03b7 \u2208 \u039e\u221e ,\n\n\u2200 x, y \u2208 A\u221e .\n\nFor n \u2208 N, \u039e\u221e \u2297 Cn is a finite projective module on Mn (A\u221e ) = A\u221e \u2297\nMn (C), this allows, replacing A by Mn (A) = A \u2297 Mn (C) (and the Gaction by \u03b1 \u2297 id) to assume the existence of a selfadjoint idempotent\ne \u2208 A\u221e and of an isomorphism F with the module e A\u221e on \u039e\u221e . We then\nendow \u039e\u221e with the following hermitian structure :\nh\u03be, \u03b7i = F \u22121 (\u03b7)\u2217 F \u22121 (\u03be) \u2208 A\u221e .\nLet \u03b4 be the representation of LieG in the Lie-algebra of derivations of\nA\u221e given by\n\u03b4X (x) = lim\n\nt\u21920\n\n1\n(\u03b1gt (x) \u2212 x) ,\nt\n\nwhere\n\n2\n\n\u01210 = X , x \u2208 A\u221e .\n\n\fDefinition 2 Let \u039e\u221e be a finite projective module on A\u221e , a connection\n(on \u039e\u221e ) is a linear map \u2207 of \u039e\u221e in \u039e\u221e \u2297 (Lie G)\u2217 such that, for all\nX \u2208 Lie G and \u03be \u2208 \u039e\u221e , x \u2208 A\u221e one has\n\u2207X (\u03be * x) = \u2207X (\u03be) * x + \u03be * \u03b4X (x) .\nWe shall say that \u2207 is compatible with the hermitian structure iff :\nh\u2207X \u03be, \u03be \u2032 i + h\u03be, \u2207X \u03be \u2032 i = \u03b4X h\u03be, \u03be \u2032 i ,\n\n\u2200 \u03be, \u03be \u2032 \u2208 \u039e\u221e ,\n\n\u2200 X \u2208 Lie G .\n\nEvery finite projective module, \u039e\u221e , on A\u221e admits a connection ; on the\nmodule e A\u221e the following formula defines the Grassmannian connection\n\u22070X (\u03be) = e \u03b4X (\u03be) \u2208 e A\u221e ,\n\n\u2200 \u03be \u2208 e A\u221e ,\n\n\u2200 X \u2208 Lie G .\n\nThis connection is compatible with the hermitian structure\nh\u03be, \u03b7i = \u03b7 \u2217 \u03be \u2208 A\u221e ,\n\n\u2200 \u03be, \u03b7 \u2208 e A\u221e .\n\nTo the representation \u03b4 of Lie G in the Lie-algebra of derivations of\nA\u221e corresponds the complex \u03a9 = A\u221e \u2297 \u039b (Lie G)\u2217 of left-invariant differential forms on G with coefficients in A\u221e .

For D elliptic, one defines\nch\u03c4 (\u03c3D ) as in the classical case as the composition of the map ch\u03c4 defined\nabove with \u03a8\u22121\nA , one then has :\nTheorem 10 One has \u03c4\u0302 \u25e6 Index D = hch\u03c4 (\u03c3D ), vi, where v = \u03b51 \u2227 . . . \u2227 \u03b5n\nis the unique element of the canonical basis of \u039bn Rn .\n\n7\n\n\fTheorem 10 remains valid when one replaces Rn by a Lie group G, in\nparticular let A = A\u03b8 , G = T2 acting on A\u03b8 as above, then the crossed\nproduct A\u03b8 \u00d7 T2 is isomorphic to the elementary C \u2217 -algebra k, the dual\ntrace \u03c4\u0302 being the standard trace on k which shows the integrality of \u03c4\u0302 \u25e6Ind,\nas in the case of ordinary compact manifolds.\nLet us consider S(R) as the right A\u221e\n\u03b8 -module \u039e(0,1) described in theorem 6, then End(S(\nP R)) is the algebra of finite difference operators of the\nform (\u2206F )(s) =\n\u03c6n (s) F (s \u2212 n), where the \u03c6n are periodic smooth\nfunctions of period \u03b8 and where the sequence \u03c6n is of rapid decay. Thus\n\u2032\nEnd(S(R)) is isomorphic to A\u221e\n\u03b8 \u2032 , where \u03b8 = 1/\u03b8 \u2212 E(1/\u03b8). Taking for\ninstance f and g periodic with period 1 fulfilling the above conditions\nrelative to \u03b8\u2032 , h(s) = g(s \u03b8), k(s) = 1 \u2212 2 f (s \u03b8), the index of the operator\nP : (P F )(s) = h(s) F \u2032 (s \u2212 1) + h(s + 1) F \u2032 (s + 1) + k(s) F \u2032 (s) + s F (s)\nis equal to 1+E(1/\u03b8), hence the existence of nonzero solutions of equations\nP F = 0, F \u2208 S(R), F 6= 0.\nRemark. Let V be a compact n-dimensional smooth manifold, \u03a8 a\ndiffeomorphism of V and A the crossed-product C \u2217 -algebra of C(V ) by\nthe automorphism \u03a8\u2217 , \u03a8\u2217 f = f \u25e6 \u03a8. Let \u039bV be the complex of smooth\ndifferential forms on V . One can define, essentially as the crossed-product\nof \u039bV by the action of \u03a8, a complex \u03a9 =\n\nn+1\nX\n\n\u03a9k . The dense involutive\n\n0\n\nsubalgebra \u03a90 of A, has properties similar to the complex \u03a9 = A\u221e \u00d7\n\u039b(Lie G) discussed above. The differentable structure thus defined does\nnot in general correspond to derivations of A.\n\nReferences\n[1] A.
