Following ideas of Graeme Segal, we construct an equivariant configuration space that is a model of equivariant connective K-homology spectrum for finite groups, as a consequence we obtain an induction structure for\nequivariant connective K-homology. We describe explicitly the homology with\ncomplex coefficients for the fixed points of this configuration space as a Hopf\nalgebra.\n\n1. Introduction\nThe purpose of this paper is to give a configuration space description of equivariant connective K-homology (Proposition 2.10). We describe the homology of the\nfixed point space of these configuration spaces, in terms of certain Hopf algebras\nstudied initially by Segal in [Seg96] and generalized by Wang in [Wan00]. We follow\nideas of Graeme Segal, and most of the results and proofs obtained here generalize\nresults contained in [Seg77] and [Seg96] to the equivariant context. Our results\nanswer a question posed by Wang in [Wan00]. Namely, let (M, m0 ) be a based\nG-Spinc -manifold. Wang asks about the possibility to relate the Hopf algebra\nM\n\u2217\nFqG (M ) =\n(M n ) \u2297 C,\nq n KG\u223cS\nn\nn\u22650\n\nto the homology of some configuration space C(M, m0 , G) thus generalizing Segal's\nwork. Finally, as a consequence, we obtain a new model for the equivariant connective K-theory spectrum. The results in this paper are part of the PhD thesis of\nthe author [Vel12].\nThe first appearance of configuration spaces in algebraic topology is possibly\nin the Dold-Thom Theorem in [DT58]. In this paper the authors consider the\ninfinite symmetric product of a based CW-complex (X, x0 ) and establish a natural\nisomorphism from its homotopy groups onto the reduced cellular homology groups\nof (X, x0 ). More precisely:\nDefinition 1.1. Let (X, x0 ) be a based CW-complex. Consider the natural action\nof the symmetric group Sn over X n . The orbit space of this action\nSP n (X) = X n /Sn\n\nDate: November 17, 2017.\n1991 Mathematics Subject Classification. Primary 19L41, 19L47.\nKey words and phrases.

SP (X) is called the infinite symmetric product of X.\nCondition 1.2. The topology of SP \u221e (X) as a configuration space is determined\nby the following properties:\n(1) If two elements converge to a third element, the label in the limit will be\nthe sum of the labels in the initial points.\n(2) If a sequence converges to x0 , then the point disappears.\nLet f CW0 be the category of based finite CW-complexes and Z \u2212 ab be the\ncategory of Z-graded abelian groups.\nTheorem 1.3 (Dold-Thom). There is a natural equivalence between \u03c0\u2217 (SP \u221e (\u2212))\ne \u2217 (\u2212), where H\ne \u2217 (\u2212) denotes reduced homology with integer coefficients.\nand H\n\nIt is an interesting problem to give a description similar to Theorem 1.3 for generalized homology theories (see for example [Shi01]). In the current paper we are\nmainly interested in K-homology. For this case it is possible to assign a configuration space, but we have to consider the connective version of K-homology.\nDefinition 1.4 (Pg. 205 in [Ada95]). Given a (generalized) reduced homology\ntheory H\u2217 defined on the category f CW0 , one can associate another homology\ntheory h\u2217 such that:\n(1) There is a natural transformation\nc : h\u2217 \u2192 H\u2217\nsuch that c is an isomorphism when we evaluate in (S 0 , 0) = ({0, 1}, 0) on\npositive indices.\n(2) For every (X, x0 ) \u2208 f CW0 , and for every n < 0 we have hn (X, x0 ) = 0.\nThe functor h\u2217 is uniquely determined by these conditions and is called the connective homology theory associated to H\u2217 . In the case of K-homology we denote\nby k\u2217 the functor connective K-homology.\nIn [Seg77] Segal constructs a functor C(\u2212) for connective K-homology analogue\nto SP \u221e (\u2212).\nDefinition 1.5. Let (X, x0 ) be a pathwise connected, based, finite CW-complex\nand let C0 (X) be the C\u2217 -algebra of complex-valued continuous functions defined\nover X that vanish on the base point x0 .

We will denote C(X, x0 )\nsimply by C(X). We will see below that\n(1.1)\n\nC(X) \u2243 \u03a9C(\u03a3X).\n\nIf X is non pathwise connected we take 1.1 as the defintion of C(X).\nThe space C(X) has a description as a configuration space.

Let (X, x0 ) be a based finite CW-complex,\ne the reduced K-homology. There is a natural map\nand denote by K\np\ne n (X)\n\u03c0n (C(X)) \u2212\u2212\u2192 K\n\nfor n \u2265 0\n\nsuch that\n(1) This application is an isomorphism when X = S 0 .\n(2) The functor \u03c0\u2217 (C(\u2212)) is a reduced homology theory in the category of based\nfinite CW-complexes, and the map p is a natural transformation between\nreduced homology theories.\nBy Definition 1.4, it follows that the functor \u03c0\u2217 (C(\u2212)) is naturally equivalent to\nreduced connective K-homology. In this paper, we use ideas of non commutative\ntopology, specifically Kasparov KK-theory, to explain a new proof and a generalization of Theorem 1.6 to an equivariant context. More precisely, we have\nTheorem 1.7. Let G be a finite group and (X, A) be a finite G-CW-pair. There\nis a configuration space C(X/A, G), with a continuous G-action and a natural map\n\u03c0nG (C(X/A, G)) \u2212\u2192 KnG (X, A)\n\nfor n \u2265 0\n\nsatisfying\n(1) For every subgroup H of G this map is an isomorphism when\n(X, A) = (G/H, \u2205)\nwith the natural G-action.\n(2) The functor \u03c0\u2217G (C(\u2212, G)) is an equivariant homology theory defined on the\ncategory of based finite G-CW-pairs.\nFor a precise definition of C(X, G) see Definition 3.1.\nNow, let us describe the other topic developed in this paper. Segal in [Seg96]\nstudies the Z \u00d7 Z/2Z-graded Hopf algebra\nM\n\u2217\nFq (X) =\n(X n ) \u2297 C,\nq n KS\nn\nn\u22650\n\n\f4\n\nMARIO VEL\u00c1SQUEZ\n\n\u2217\n0\nwhere q is a formal variable (q gives the grading) and where KG\n(\u2212) = KG\n(\u2212) \u2295\n1\nKG (\u2212). The product is defined using the induction functor from (Sn \u00d7 Sm )-equivariant vector bundles to Sn+m -equivariant vector bundles, and the coproduct\nis defined using the corresponding restriction functor. Considering a connected\neven dimensional Spinc -manifold, Segal found a relation between the Hopf algebra\nFq (X) and the homology of the configuration space C(X). Note that H\u2217 (C(X); C)\nis endowed with the Hopf algebra structure induced by the Hopf space structure in\nC(X) given by 'putting together' the configurations. More precisely Segal proves\nin [Seg96] the following theorem:\n\nTheorem 1.8. Let M be a connected even dimensional Spinc -manifold. There is\na natural isomorphism of Z \u00d7 Z/2Z-graded Hopf algebras\nq (M ),\nH\u2217 (C(M ); C) \u223c\n= F\\\n\nwhere the completion is taken over the augmentation ideal.\nAs is proved in [Seg96], and generalized in [Wan00], the algebra Fq (X) carries\nseveral interesting properties. For example it is a free \u03bb-ring, has the size of a Fock\nspace of a certain infinite-dimensional Heisenberg superalgebra, and it is the target\nof the power operations in equivariant K-theory.\nIn [Wan00], Wang defines an equivariant generalization of Fq (X). Consider the\nwreath product Gn = G\u2240Sn which is a semidirect product of the n-th direct product\nGn of G and the symmetric group Sn . If G acts on X there is an action of the\ngroup Gn on X n induced by the actions of Gn and Sn on X n .\nDefinition 1.9. Let X be a G-CW-complex, we denote by FqG (X) to the Z\u00d7Z/2Zgraded Hopf algebra\nM\n\u2217\nFqG (X) =\n(X n ) \u2297 C.\nq n KG\nn\nn\u22650\n\nwith the product and coproduct defined using induction and restriction functors on\nKG . For a precise definition see Definition 6.3.\n\nWe generalize Theorem 1.8 to an equivariant setting. We prove that the homology groups of the G-fixed points of C(X, G) carry a natural Z \u00d7 Z/2Z-graded\nHopf algebra structure. Using an equivariant version of the Chern character due\nto L\u00fcck in [L\u00fcc02], we find a Z \u00d7 Z/2Z-graded Hopf algebra isomorphism from\nq\nH\u2217 (C(M, G)G ; C) to F\\\nG (M ). More precisely we have\nTheorem 1.10. Let M be an even dimensional G-Spinc -manifold. The Z \u00d7 Z/2Zgraded complex vector space H\u2217 (C(M, G)G ; C) carries a natural Z \u00d7 Z/2Z-graded\nHopf algebra and there is a natural isomorphism of Z \u00d7 Z/2Z-graded Hopf algebras\nq\nH\u2217 (C(M, G)G ; C) \u223c\n= F\\\nG (M ),\n\nwhere the completion is taken over the augmentation ideal.\nApplying this theorem to M = S 0 , we obtain an expression for the homology of\nthe G-fixed points of the equivariant infinite Grasmannian in terms of the representation ring of wreath products.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we recall the definition of the\nequivariant K-theory spectrum, and fix notations about some functions spaces and\nG-actions over these. We recall definitions of equivariant homology theories, and\nits connective versions in the sense of [L\u00fcc02].\nIn Section 3 we define the configuration space associated to equivariant Khomology and prove that the functor defined as its homotopy groups is a Ghomology theory. In Section 4 we define a natural transformation from the homotopy groups of the configuration space to equivariant K-homology and prove\n\n\fA CONFIGURATION SPACE FOR EQUIVARIANT CONNECTIVE K-HOMOLOGY\n\n5\n\nthat this natural transformation is an isomorphism, when we apply it to the space\nS 0 , with the trivial G-action.\nIn Section 5 we prove that the functor defined in Section 3 has an induction\nstructure over finite groups in the sense defined by L\u00fcck in [L\u00fcc02]. We use this\nfact to prove that the functor is an equivariant homology theory, and finally deduce\nthat it is naturally equivalent to equivariant connective K-homology.\nIn Section 6 we describe an isomorphism between the complex homology of the\nfixed point space of the configuration space and the Hopf algebra FqG (X).\nContents\n1.

Notice that the notion of equivariant homology theory introduced\nhere is more restrictive than the notion of compatible family of equivariant homology theories in [LMSM86] because that notion only consider the case when the\nhomomorphism \u03b1 is an inclusion.\nIt is natural (in analogy with [Ada95, Pg. 205]) to associate to the equivariant\nK-homology a connective G-homology theory in the following way.\nProposition 2.10. [Gre05, Secc. 3] There is a G-homology theory k\u2217G such that:\n(1) There is a natural transformation c : k\u2217G \u2192 K\u2217G such that c is an isomorphism when we evaluate in homogeneous spaces G/H over positive indexes.\n(2) For every G-CW-complex X and for every i < 0, kiG (X) = 0.\nThe functor k\u2217G is uniquely determined up to natural equivalence by these conditions\nand is called G-equivariant connective K-homology.\n3. The configuration space\nLet us recall from Section 1 that in the non-equivariant case, the connective\nK-homology groups of a finite based CW-complex (X, x0 ) are naturally isomorphic\nto the homotopy groups of the configuration space C(X) of finite subsets of X \u2212\n{x0 }, where each point is labelled by an element of the infinite Grassmannian\nof C\u221e . It would be natural to describe the equivariant K-homology of a finite\nbased G-CW-complex (X, x0 ) as the equivariant homotopy groups of a configuration\nspace C(X, x0 , G) whose elements are finite subsets of X \u2212 {x0 } and the labels\nare elements of an appropriate equivariant analogue to the infinite Grassmannian.\nIn this section, we construct an equivariant analogue of C(X) and prove that its\nequivariant homotopy groups form a G-homology theory.\n\n\fA CONFIGURATION SPACE FOR EQUIVARIANT CONNECTIVE K-HOMOLOGY\n\n9\n\n3.1. Descriptions of the configuration space. In this section we define the Gspace C(X, G) in terms of spaces of \u2217-homomorphisms. We also give a description\nof C(X, G) as a configuration space and a geometric description of the G-action on\nit.\nDefinition 3.1. Let G be a finite group and (X, x0 ) be a based G-connected, GCW-complex. Let C(X, x0 , G) be the G-space of configurations of complex vector\nspaces over (X, x0 ), defined as the following union, with respect to the inclusions\nFRn (HG ) \u2192 FRn+1 (HG )\n[\nC(X, x0 , G) =\nHom\u2217 (C0 (X), FRn (HG )),\nn\u22650\n\nwith the compact open topology. Notice that * refers to *-homomorphism.\nWe endow to C(X, x0 , G) with a G-action in the following way. If F \u2208 C(X, x0 , G),\nwe define\ng * F : C0 (X) \u2212\u2192 FRn (HG )\nf 7\u2212\u2192 g * F (g \u22121 * f ).\nThis action is continuous. As X is G-connected, C(X, x0 , G) is also G-connected\nand its equivariant homotopy groups do not depend on the base point x0 , we can\ndenote C(X, x0 , G) simply by C(X, G).\nThe space C(X, G) has a description as a configuration space. To obtain that\ndescription we need to recall the Gelfand-Naimark theorem, for a proof of the\nGelfand-Naimark theorem see [Dav96, Thm. I.3.1].\nDefinition 3.2. The spectrum of the C\u2217 -algebra C0 (X) is the based topological\nspace of characters\n\u2217\nC\\\n0 (X) = Hom (C0 (X), C),\nwith the strong\u2217 -topology and with base point the zero character 0.\nTheorem 3.3 (Gelfand-Naimark). Evaluation gives us a homeomorphism of based\nspaces\n\u03be\n(X, x0 ) \u2212\u2212\u2192 (C\\\n0 (X), 0)\n\nx 7\u2212\u2192 \u03be(x)[f ] = f (x).\nLet F \u2208 Hom\u2217 (C0 (X), FRn (HG )). For every f \u2208 C0 (X) we have\nF (f )(F (f ))\u2217 = F (f f \u2217 )\n= F (f \u2217 f )\n= F (f )\u2217 F (f ).\nThen the operator F (f ) is normal, so it is diagonalizable. Moreover as C0 (X) is\ncommutative the corresponding eigenspaces do not depend on f because all elements\nin\n{F (f ) | f \u2208 C0 (X)} \u2286 F Rn (HG )\nare simultaneously diagonalizable.\nTaking eigenvalues give us a continuous map\nC(X, G) \u2212\u2192 SP \u221e (C\\\n0 (X), 0)\ncomposing with the Gelfand-Naimark homeomorphism we have a map\nC(X, G) \u2212\u2192 SP \u221e (X, x0 ).\nIn the same way we have the following description of C(X, G).\n\n\f10\n\nMARIO VEL\u00c1SQUEZ\n\nRemark 3.4.

Let us filter C(X/A, G) by G-closed spaces in the following way\nCn (X/A, G) = {F \u2208 C(X/A, G) | rank(F ) \u2264 n}.\nWe want to prove in the following lines that p | p\u22121 (Cn (X/A, G)) is a quasifibration and using Lemma 3.13(2) conclude that p is a quasifibration. We proceed by\ninduction.\nLemma 3.16. The restriction map p | p\u22121 (Cn (X/A, G)) is a G-quasifibration.\nProof. The case n = 0 is trivial because it is a map from a point to a point.\nNow suppose that p | p\u22121 (Cn (X/A, G)) is a quasifibration. We will prove that\np | p\u22121 (Cn+1 (X/A, G)) is a quasifibration in two steps.\nStep 1: Let us show that we can find a G-open set U in p\u22121 (Cn+1 (X/A, G))\nsuch that U is a (weak) deformation retract of p\u22121 (Cn (X/A, G)) and p | p\u22121 (U )\nis a quasifibration. The existence of U will be proved in the following argument.\nRecall that there is a G-neighborhood N \u2286 X of A such that N is a G-deformation\nretract of A.\nLet rt : X \u2192 X, (t \u2208 [0, 1]) be a homotopy, such that r1 (N ) = A, rt (a) = a for\nevery a \u2208 A, and r0 = idX . The homotopy rt induces also a homotopy\nr\u0304t : X/A \u2192 X/A.\nConsider the map\n(r\u03041 )\u2217 : Cn+1 (X/A, G) \u2212\u2192 Cn+1 (X/A, G).\nn\nn+1\nThe set (r\u03041 )\u22121\n(X/A, G).

Consider the set U = p\u22121 (W ). The homotopy\nrt\u2217 : p\u22121 (Cn+1 (X/A, G)) \u2212\u2192 p\u22121 (Cn+1 (X/A, G))\nrestricted to U is a weak deformation retract of U to p\u22121 (Cn (X/A, G)), and the\nhomotopy rt\u2217 covers r\u0304t\u2217 . To conclude that p : U \u2192 p(U ) is a G-quasifibration it is\nenough to prove that r1\u2217 : p\u22121 (b) \u2192 p\u22121 (r\u03041\u2217 (b)) is a weak Gb -homotopy equivalence\nand then use Lemma 3.13(3). The proof of r\u03041\u2217 is a Gb -homotopy equivalence is\ncompletely analogue to the proof of Lemma 3.14.\nStep 2: Prove that\np | (p\u22121 (Cn+1 (X/A, G) \u2212 Cn (X/A, G)))\nand\np | (p\u22121 (Cn+1 (X/A, G) \u2212 Cn (X/A, G)) \u2229 p\u22121 (U ))\nare G-quasifibrations.\nIn this step we prove directly that the induced maps in the corresponding homotopy groups are isomorphisms. We only prove that\np | (p\u22121 (Cn+1 (X/A, G) \u2212 Cn (X/A, G)))\nis a G-quasifibration. The case for\np | (p\u22121 (Cn+1 (X/A, G) \u2212 Cn (X/A, G)) \u2229 p\u22121 (U ))\nis completely analogue.\n\n\fA CONFIGURATION SPACE FOR EQUIVARIANT CONNECTIVE K-HOMOLOGY\n\n15\n\nIn order to prove that the induced map on homotopy groups is surjective we\nwant to define a continuous section\ns : Cn+1 (X/A, G) \u2212 Cn (X/A, G) \u2212\u2192 p\u22121 (Cn+1 (X/A, G) \u2212 Cn (X/A, G)).\nAs in Remark 3.4 every F \u2208 Cn+1 (X/A, G) \u2212 Cn (X/A, G) can be identified with a\nconfiguration\n{(x1 , V1 ), . . .

Let us start with some preliminaries.\n4.1. Equivariant KK-theory. Atiyah proved that elliptic operators between sections of two vector bundles E \u2192 X and F \u2192 Y give rise to maps between K-theory\ngroups of X and Y (see for example [Ati68]). Kasparov extend this idea to a\ngeneralized elliptic operator (see Definition 4.2). Given two C\u2217 -algebras C and B,\na generalized elliptic operator \u03b7 defined between Hilbert modules over C and B\ninduces a map in K-theory\n\u2212\u266f\u03b7\n\nK\u2217 (B) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 K\u2217 (C).\nThe study of the homotopy classes of generalized elliptic operators (see Definition\n4.4) is very important in non commutative topology and in index theory (for a good\nintroduction to the subject see for example [Hig90]). We will use the properties of\nthis homotopy classes, in particular a convenient form of Bott periodicity in order\nto construct the natural transformation A. In this section we follow [Bla98, Chapter\nVIII].\nDefinition 4.1. A Z/2Z-graded G-C\u2217 -algebra C = C 0 \u2295 C 1 , is a C\u2217 -algebra\nequipped with an action of G by \u2217 -automorphisms preserving the grading. Given\ntwo Z/2Z-graded G-C\u2217 -algebras C and B, a map \u03c6 : C \u2192 B is called a G-*homomorphism if it is G-equivariant and a *-homomorphism.\nGiven a Z/2Z-graded G-C\u2217 -algebra B, a Z/2Z-graded Hilbert B-module is a\nZ/2Z-graded B-module with a Z/2Z-graded B-valued inner product. Over a Z/2Zgraded Hilbert B-module E one can define the Z/2Z-graded G-C\u2217 -algebra of bounded\noperators denoted by B(E) and the Z/2Z-graded G-C\u2217 -algebra of compact operators denoted by K(E), in both cases we take the usual grading coming from E. For\nprecise definitions see [Bla98, Secc. VI.13].\nDefinition 4.2. Let C and B be (Z/2-) graded G-C\u2217 -algebras. We denote by\nEG (C, B) to the set of Kasparov G-modules (or generalized G-elliptic operators)\nfor (C, B), that is the set of triples (E, \u03c6, F ) such that\n(1) E is a graded countably generated Hilbert B-module with a continuous\nG-action.\n(2) \u03c6 : C \u2192 B(E) is a graded *- homomorphism.\n(3) F is a G-continuous operator in B(E) of degree 1, such that for every c \u2208 C\nand g \u2208 G\n(a) F \u03c6(c) \u2212 \u03c6(c)F ,\n(b) (F 2 \u2212 Id)\u03c6(c),\n(c) (F \u2212 F \u2217 )\u03c6(c) and\n(d) (g * F \u2212 F )\u03c6(c)\nare all in K(E).\nThe set DG (C, B) of degenerate Kasparov modules is the set of triples in EG (C, B)\nfor which\n(1) F \u03c6(c) \u2212 \u03c6(c)F = 0,\n(2) (F 2 \u2212 Id)\u03c6(c) = 0,\n(3) (F \u2212 F \u2217 )\u03c6(c) = 0, and\n\n\fA CONFIGURATION SPACE FOR EQUIVARIANT CONNECTIVE K-HOMOLOGY\n\n17\n\n(4) (g * F \u2212 F )\u03c6(c) = 0,\nfor all c \u2208 C and g \u2208 G.\nExample 4.3. Let \u03c6 : C \u2192 K(HG ) be a graded G-*-homomorphism. Then\n(HG , \u03c6, 0) is a Kasparov G-(C, C)-module.\nDefinition 4.4. Let IB = C([0, 1], B) be the C\u2217 -algebra of continuous maps from\n[0, 1] to B. A homotopy connecting (E0 , \u03c60 , F0 ) and (E1 , \u03c61 , F1 ) in EG (C, B) is\nb fi B, fi \u25e6 \u03c6, fi\u2217 (F )) is G-unitary\nan element (E, \u03c6, F ) of EG (C, IB) for which (E \u2297\nequivalent to (Ei , \u03c6i , Fi ), where fi , for i = 0, 1, is the evaluation homomorphism\nfrom IB to B.\nThe notion of homotopy respects direct sums. Homotopy equivalence is denoted\nby \u223ch . If we have E0 = E1 , then a standard homotopy is a homotopy of the\nform E = C([0, 1], E0 ) (which is a Hilbert IB-module in the obvious way), with\n\u03c6 = (\u03c6t ), and F = (Ft ), where t \u2192 Ft and t \u2192 \u03c6t (c) are strong G-*-operator\ncontinuous for each c. A standard homotopy where in addition \u03c6t is constant and\nFt is norm-continuous is called an operator homotopy.\nDefinition 4.5. Direct sums turns EG (C, B) into an abelian semigroup. We denote\nby KKG (C, B) to the set of equivalence classes of EG (C, B) under \u223ch . More\ngenerally, we set\nn\nKKG\n(C, B) = KKG (C, B \u2297 Cliff(n))\nwhere G acts trivially in Cliff(n). In each case, the set is an abelian semigroup\nunder direct sum.\nn\nThe bifunctor KKG\n(\u2212, \u2212) gives us a convenient description of equivariant Khomology that we will use to define the natural transformation. We have the\nfollowing result.\n\nProposition 4.6 (Corol. 18.5.4 in [Bla98]). There are natural isomorphisms\ne n (X) \u223c\nK\n= KK n (C, C0 (X)) and\nG\n\nG\n\nn\ne nG (X) \u223c\nK\n(C0 (X), C).\n= KKG\n\nWe need also a result about the invariance of KK-theory by compact perturbations.\nProposition 4.7 (Corol. 17.8.8 in [Bla98]). For any C there is a natural isomorphism\nKKG (C, K(HG )) \u223c\n= KKG (C, C).\n4.2. A natural transformation. In this section we define a natural transformation A from the equivariant homotopy groups of the configuration space C(X, G)\nto the equivariant reduced K-homology groups of X. To this end we use the description of equivariant reduced K-homology as a KK-group given in Proposition\n4.6.\nGiven a G-\u2217 -homomorphism \u03c6 : C \u2192 K(HG ), an element in KKG (C, C) can be\nassigned as Example 4.3. Thus if X is G-connected, we have a map\n\u223cK\ne G (X)\nA(X) : \u03c00 (C(X, G)G ) \u2212\u2192 KK 0 (C0 (X), C) =\nG\n\n0\n\n[\u03c6] 7\u2212\u2192 [(K(HG ), \u03c6, 0)].\n\nNotice that homotopy of points on C(X, G) correspond to a standard homotopy\non Kasparov G-modules then the map A(X) is well defined. The map A(\u2212) is a\n0\n(\u2212, C). To extend\nnatural transformation from the functor \u03c00 (C(\u2212, G)G ) to KKG\nthis natural transformation to all n \u2265 0 we need a particular form of the Bott\nperiodicity theorem.\n\n\f18\n\nMARIO VEL\u00c1SQUEZ\n\nDefinition 4.8.

Let g be the set of primitive elements, these\nare elements x in A such that\n\u2206(x) = x \u2297 1 + 1 \u2297 x, \u01eb(x) = 0.\nThen g is a Lie algebra with the bracket [x, y] = xy \u2212 yx, and we can consider its\nenveloping algebra U (g) viewed as a Hopf algebra. Let \u0393 be the set of 'group-like'\nelements, that is the elements g in A such that\n\u2206(g) = g \u2297 g, \u01eb(g) = 1.\nFor the multiplication in A, the elements of \u0393 form a group, where the inverse of g\nis S(g) (here S is the antipode in A).
