The earliest\nindicators of agriculture in the form of cultivation of cereals and pulses are rearing of animals\ncome from Zagros foothills. Their age, 11700 \u2013 8400 BC corresponds to the cool dry climatic\nperiod followed by a rapid increase in rainfall at the beginning of the Holocene (~ 10000 BC).\nDuring the early stages of agricultural development (Preceramic Neolithic 9800 \u2013 7500\nBC) the rapid increase in the number of sites is noticeable in both the foothills and the\nsurrounding plains accompanied by the appearance of large settlements with complicated\nmasonry structures and fortifications (e.g. Jericho).\nAt a later stage the core area of early agricultural settlements shifts to the north to the\neastern highlands and inner depressions of Asia Minor. The most outstanding case of early\nagricultural development in this area is Catal H\u00fcy\u00fck, a Neolithic town on the Konya Plain\n(6500 \u2013 5700 BC).\nThe earliest sites with developed agricultural economies in Europe, dated 6400 \u2013 6000\nBC are found in the intermontane depressions of Greece (Thessaly, Beotia and Pelloponesse).\nGenetic features of the cultigens and the general character of the material culture leave no\ndoubt to their Near \u2013 Eastern origins. Significantly, the early Neolithic sites in the Marmara\nSea are of a more recent age (6100 \u2013 5600 BC), being culturally distinct from the Early\nNeolithic in Greece. This implies that the Neolithic communities could penetrate the Balkan\nPeninsula from Western Asia by means of navigation.\nThe Neolithic spread further, plausibly via the Strouma axis in the northeast and the\nVardar \u2013 Morava axis in the north. The ensuing development saw a rapid growth of Neolithic\nsettlements in the depressions of northern Thrace the Lower and Middle Danube catchment\nbasin (5900 \u2013 5500 BC).\nThe next stage in the Neolithic development saw the emergence of new sites on the\nTisza Plain in 5600 \u2013 5500 BC [1].\nThe new sites later spread over the vast areas of the loess plains of Central Europe,\nmostly along the Danube, Rhine \u2013 Mainz and Vistula axes. This spread occurred within the\nrange of 5600 \u2013 4800 BC within the most probable age of 5154 \u00b1 62 BC [2].\nJudging from the number of sites the population in the Near East started increasing ~\n15000 BC. Ammerman and Cavalli \u2013 Sforza [3] focused on measuring the rate of spread of\nearly farming in Europe and derived the rate of spread v ~ 1 km/year on average in Europe.\n\n\fThe Danube and Rhine valleys the propagation paths had an increased propagation speed as\ndid the Mediterranean west [4]. The speeds of propagation of the wave front v in these areas\nare as follows:\nv = 1 km/year on average in Europe\nv = 4 \u2013 6 km/year for the Danube \u2013 Rhine valleys\nv = 10 km/year for Mediterranean regions\nInterpretations of these observations are usually based on the reaction \u2013 diffusion\nequation of population dynamics [5,6]. Fort and M\u00e9ndez [6,7] discussed the front propagation\nrate resulting from the generalization of Fisher model, but their results are restricted to the\nhomogenous system.\nThe aim of this work is to formulate and develop a model for the spread of incipient\nfarming in Europe taking into account the environmental influences on the migration\nprocesses.\n\n2.\n\nThe model\n\nFick diffusion equation is a special case of the parabolic transport equation in which\nspeed of perturbation propagation is infinite. Parabolic transport equation has been applied to\nthe spread of advantageous genes [8] dispersion of biological population [9], epidemic models\n[10].\nHowever if perturbation propagates at finite speed, Fick law does not hold [11]. This\nunphysical feature can be avoided by making use of hyperbolic transport equation [11]. The\nhyperbolic propagation equation, HPE has been very recently applied to the spread of\nepidemics [12], forest fire models [13] and chemical system [14].\nAn interesting application of the Fick law to the migration in neolithic Europe was\npresented in [15].\nSuch a model as was presented in [15] provides a consistent explanation for the origin of\nIndo \u2013 European languages [16] and also finds remarkable support from the observed gene\nfrequencies [17].\nIn this paper we develop the model for the population migration following the method\npresented in [11].\nLet n(x,t) stands for population density (measured in number of families per square\nkilometer) where x is Cartesian coordinate and t is time. We assume that a well defined time\n\n\fscale, \u03c4 between two successive migration steps exists. The migrated population interacts with\nenvironment. This interaction we will model by potential V. in that case the hyperbolic\nmigration equation can be written as [11]:\n\n\u03c4\n\n\u2202 2 p \u2202p Vp k\n\u22022 p\n+\n+\np\n=\nD\n+ G ( x, t )\n\u2202t 2 \u2202t DE k\n\u2202x 2\n\n(1)\n\nIn equation (1) D is the migration diffusion coefficient, pk and Ek denote the momentum\nand kinetic energy of migration and G(x,t) is the population growth.\nEquation (1) is the Heaviside equation for population density [4]. It is the hyperbolic\n2\nequation which describes the migration with memory. Memory term \u03c4 \u2202 p\n\n\u2202t 2\n\nchanges the\n\ntype of the equation. For \u03c4 = 0 equation [1] is the parabolic Fick equation for population\nmigration.\nWe seek solution of the Eq.(1) in the form\np ( x, t ) = e \u2212 2\u03c4 u ( x, t )\nt\n\n(2)\n\nAfter substituting of Eq. (2) to Eq.(1) one obtains\n\n\u23a1 1\nVp k2 \u23a4 G ( x, t ) t 2\u03c4\n1 \u2202 2u \u2202 2u\n\u2212\n+ u ( x, t ) \u23a2 \u2212\n+ 2 \u23a5=\ne .\nD\nv 2 \u2202t 2 \u2202x 2\n\u23a3 4\u03c4D D E k \u23a6\n\n(3)\n\nFor V < 0, i.e. for attractive potential equation (3) is the modified Klein \u2013 Gordon\nequation, i.e. so called \"telegrapher equation\". For V > 0 we have two possibilities:\n\n\u03c4>\n\nEk D\n4Vpk2\n\n(4)\n\n\u03c4<\n\nEk D\n4Vpk2\n\n(5)\n\nand\n\nIn the case described by the inequality (4) equation (3) is the Klein \u2013 Gordon equation\nand for (5) Eq. (3) is the telegrapher equation.\nIn the following we will consider the V < 0, i.e. attractive potential; in that case equation\n(3) can be written as\n1 \u2202 2u \u2202 2u\n\u2212\n\u2212 qu ( x, t ) = F ( x, t ).\nv 2 \u2202t 2 \u2202x 2\nq=\n\nand\n\nV p k2\n1\n+ 2 ,\n4\u03c4D D E k\n\nq>0\n\n(6)\n(7)\n\n\fG ( x, t ) e\nF ( x, t ) =\nD\n\nt\n\n2\u03c4\n\n(8)\n\nLet us consider the initial condition\n\nu ( x, t ) = f ( x),\n\nu t ( x,0) = g ( x)\n\n(9)\n\n-\u221e < x < \u221e\nfor the equation (6). Then the general solution of Eq. (6) can be written as [18]:\nu ( x, t ) =\n\nf ( x \u2212 vt ) + f ( x + vt )\n2\nx + vt\n1\n1\ng (\u03c2 ) I 0 qv 2 v 2 t 2 \u2212 ( x \u2212 \u03c2 ) 2 d\u03c2\n+\n\u222b\n2v x \u2212vt\n\n[( )\n\nx + vt\n\n1\n\nI\n(qv) 2\nt \u222b f (\u03c2 ) 1\n\u2212\n2\nx \u2212 vt\nt\n\n1\n+ \u222b\n2v 0\n\nx + v ( t \u2212\u03b7 )\n\n\u222b\u03b7\n\n]\n\n[( )\nq\nv\n\n1\n\nv 2t 2 \u2212 ( x \u2212 \u03c2 ) 2\n\n2\n\nv 2t 2 \u2212 ( x \u2212 \u03c2 ) 2\n\nF (\u03c2 ,\u03b7 )vI 0\n\n[( )\nq\nv\n\n1\n\n2\n\n]d\u03c2\n\n(10)\n\n]\n\nv 2 (t \u2212 \u03b7 ) 2 \u2212 ( x \u2212 \u03c2 ) 2 d\u03c2d\u03b7 .\n\nx \u2212v (t \u2212 )\n\nConsidering Eq. (10) and Eq. (2) the solution of Eq. (1) can be written as:\np ( x , t ) = e \u2212 2\u03c4 u ( x , t )\nt\n\n(11)\n\nwhere the u(x,t) is described by formula (10).\nAs can be seen from formula (11) the general solution of Eq. (1) is the sum of the\nwave motion described by the term\nf ( x \u2212 vt ) + f ( x + vt )\n2\n\nand the lag term.\nIn conclusion one can say that the migration can be described as the damped wave\nmotion which for t \u2192 \u221e is going to diffusion of the population.\n\nReferences\n[1]\n\nN.
