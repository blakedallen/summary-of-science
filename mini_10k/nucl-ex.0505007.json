Furthermore, the two neutrons halo systems, such\n\n\u2217 Present address: GSI, D-64291 Darmstadt, Germany; Electronic\naddress: l.giot@gsi.de\n\nas 6 He, 11 Li and 14 Be, exhibit Borromean characteristics, whereby the two-body subsystems are unbound [2].\nAmong these Borromean nuclei, the case of the 6 He nucleus is of a special interest from both experimental and\ntheoretical points of view to study the halo phenomenon\nand 3-body correlations, especially because the \u03b1 core\ncan be represented as structureless. The importance\nof the dineutron and cigarlike \u03b1+2n configurations predicted for the 6 He ground-state wave function [2] was\ninvestigated by means of a 2n transfer reaction or a ra-\n\n\f2\ndiative proton capture [3, 4]. These two experiments give\nopposite conclusions concerning the relative importance\nof dineutron and cigarlike configurations.\nAn additional question arises whether the only contributions to the 6 He ground-state wave function are the\ncigar and di-neutron configurations, or if some t +t clustering is also present. According to translational invariant shell model calculations [5], the 6 He nucleus is expected to have a large spectroscopic amplitude for the\nt +t configuration as well as for the \u03b1+2n configuration, like the 6 Li nucleus for the configurations \u03b1+d and\n3\nHe+t . Microscopic multicluster calculations show also\nthat the binding energy of 6 He is better reproduced by\nincluding some t +t clustering in the ground state wave\nfunction [6]. The spectroscopic factors predicted for the\nt +t configuration by the different models range from 0.44\n[7] to 1.77 [5].\nExperimentally, this t +t clustering was investigated\nfor the first time by means of (t ,6 He) transfer reactions\non several targets and a spectroscopic factor St\u2212t of 1.77\nwas proposed [8]. Recently, Wang et al. determined\nthe charge radius of the 6 He nucleus by using a laser\nspectroscopy method and compared the experimental extracted radius with those predicted by nuclear structure\ncalculations [9]. The experimental radius is very close to\nthe predictions of the \u03b1+2n cluster models but far away\nfrom those using a combination of \u03b1+2n and t +t clusters. To determine the importance of the \u03b1+2n and t +t\nconfigurations of the 6 He nucleus, Wolski et al. measured\nat Dubna the intermediate angles of the 6 He(p,t )4 He\nangular distribution [10], in analogy with the reaction\n6\nLi(p,3 He)4 He used to study the relative importance of\nthe configurations \u03b1+d and 3 He+t for the 6 Li nucleus\n[11]. This reaction performed at 150 MeV can proceed\nas the transfer of two neutrons or of a 3 H from the 6 He\nnucleus. Several analyses leading to very different spectroscopic factors St\u2212t were performed on these experimental data within the distorted wave Born approximation (DWBA) framework. The DWBA analysis done by\nWolski et al. suggests a spectroscopic factor St\u2212t of 0.42.\nRusek et al. also conclude to a small spectroscopic factor\nSt\u2212t equal to 0.25 [12]. The extreme case is the analysis\nof Oganessian et al., which described the data in a fourbody three dimensional DWBA approach without any\nt +t clustering [13]. At the opposite, Heiberg-Andersen\net al. reproduced these data with a spectroscopic factor\nSt\u2212t of 1.21 and took also into account the 2n sequential\ntransfer [14]. All these calculations call for data covering\na wider range, especially at backward angles where the\ndependence of the 6 He(p,t )4 He differential cross section\nwith the value of the spectroscopic factor St\u2212t is important whereas the effect of the spectroscopic factor S\u03b1\u22122n\nis dominant at forward angles. Hence to clarify the situation between the different values of the spectroscopic\nfactor St\u2212t , we measured at GANIL the complete angular\ndistribution for the 6 He(p,t )4 He with a special emphasis\non the forward and backward angles which were never\nmeasured.\n\nII.\n\nEXPERIMENTAL METHOD\n\nThe experiment was carried out at the GANIL coupled\ncyclotron facility. The composite secondary beam was\nproduced by the fragmentation of a 780 MeV 13 C beam\nof 5 \u03bcAe on a 1040 mg/cm2 carbon production target\nlocated between the two superconducting solenoids of the\nSISSI device [15]. The 6 He nuclei were selected with the\ntwo dipoles of the \u03b1 spectrometer and an achromatic Al\ndegrader located at the dispersive plane between these\ntwo dipoles. The only contaminant was 9 Be at a level of\n1%. The resulting 150 MeV 6 He beam with an average\nintensity of 1.1 105 pps impinged on a (CH2 )3 target, 18\nmg/cm2 thick, located in the reaction chamber. A sketch\nof the experimental setup is shown on Fig. 1. Due to the\nlarge emittance of the secondary fragmentation beam,\nthe incident angle and the position on the target of the\nnuclei were monitored event by event by two low pressure\ndrift chambers [16]. The angular and position resolutions\non the target were respectively 0.14\u25e6 and 2.4 mm.\nMUST\nCsI\n\nt\n\nDrift chambers\n\nSi(Li)\nSi\n4 He\n\nSPEG\n\n6He\n25 MeV/nucleon\n\n(CH2 ) 3\n\nMUST\nFIG. 1: (Color online) Experimental setup.\n\nThe 4 He and 3 H from the 6 He(p,t )4 He reaction for center of mass angles between 20\u25e6 and 110\u25e6 were detected in\ncoincidence by the eight telescopes of MUST silicon detector array [17]. These detectors were separated in two\ngroups arranged to form two 12x12 cm2 squares placed on\neach side of the beam, one covering an angular range between 6\u25e6 and 24\u25e6 and the other one between 20\u25e6 and 38\u25e6\nwith respect to the beam direction. The angular coverage in the vertical direction was \u00b1 9\u25e6 . Each of the MUST\ntelescopes is composed of a doubled-sided silicon strip detector backed by a Si(Li) and a CsI scintillator which all\ngive an energy measurement. The silicon strip detector\nis 300 \u03bcm thick with 60 strips (1 mm wide) on each side\nand provides X-Y position measurement, from which the\nscattering angle is determined. The energy resolution in\nthe silicon strips detectors was 65 keV and the angular\nresolution 0.15\u25e6 . The 4 He and 3 H nuclei were identified\nby the standard \u2206E-E technique. Due to a saturation\nof the Si(Li) preamplifiers, we did not measure the total\nenergy of the \u03b1 particles.

The particles were\nidentified in the focal plane by the energy loss measured\nin an ionization chamber and the residual energy measured in plastic scintillators. The momentum and the\nscattering angle were obtained by track reconstruction\nof the trajectory as determined by two drift chambers\nlocated near the focal plane of the spectrometer. The\nspectrometer was also used to measure the elastic scattering 6 He(p,p)6 He angular distribution from 14\u25e6 c.m. to\n60\u25e6 c.m. .\nTo extract differential cross sections, data were corrected for the geometrical efficiency of the detection in\nSPEG or MUST. This efficiency was determined through\na Monte-Carlo simulation whose ingredients are the detector geometry, their experimental angular and energy\nresolutions, the position and the width of the beam on\nthe target. The error on the MUST detection efficiency\ndeduced from the Monte-Carlo simulation is estimated to\nbe 5 %. The absolute normalisation for the elastic scattering data on the protons in the (CH2 )3 target and for\nthe transfer reaction was obtained from the elastic scattering on 12 C which was measured simultaneously. Elastic scattering calculations for the system 6 He+12 C using\n\ndifferent optical potentials [19, 20] show that the angular\ndistribution at forward angles up to 7\u25e6 c.m. is dominated\nby Coulomb scattering and is rather insensitive to the\npotential used. Therefore the absolute normalisation of\nthe data was obtained from the measured cross section\non the first maximum of the 6 He(12 C,12 C)6 He angular\ndistribution. The uncertainty on the normalisation is of\nthe order of 10 %. The same normalisation factor was\napplied to the transfer data measured with the SPEG\nspectrometer. In the overlap domain between 19\u25e6 c.m.\nand 27\u25e6 c.m. for the transfer data obtained with SPEG\nor MUST, the agreement was good. The final differential\ncross section in this angular region is the statistical average value between the two sets of data. Fig. 3 displays\nthe transfer data obtained in the present experiment together with results measured previously at Dubna at the\nsame energy [10]. The uncertainty of the dubna differential cross sections is estimated to be within a 30% limit,\nmainly due to the beam monitoring errors. The error\nbars displayed for the GANIL data are purely statistical. The data points between 120\u25e6 and 155\u25e6 could not\nbe obtained due to a lack of statistics in a set of runs\nwith the MUST array positionned in this angular region.\nThe main difference between the two sets of data obtained at GANIL and Dubna is related to the width of\nthe second minimum around 90\u25e6 which is larger in our\ncase. The Dubna data were extracted from the energy\ncorrelation between the \u03b1 particles and the tritons detected in coincidence in two telescopes. This energy correlation presented a strong background, caused by the\nbreakup of the 6 He particles on the carbon component of\nthe target. The breakup background is not uniform and\ncould explain the difference observed between the two\nsets of data in the angular range corresponding to the\n\n\f4\n\n10\n\n3\n\n6\n\nd\u03c3/d\u03a9 (mbarn/sr)\n\ndeep minimum around 90\u25e6 . Here, the angular correlation\nof the 4 He and 3 H nuclei combined with a selection on\nthe kinematical locus on the 3 H plot, energy versus scattering angle, reduced strongly the breakup background\nand improved the quality of the data, as shown on Fig.\n2. Moreover, the oscillation widths of the GANIL data\nare in better agreement with the new data measured at\nDubna by Stepantsov et al. [21].\n\n10\n\n2\n\n10\n\nJLM\n\n1\n\nIII.\n\nELASTIC SCATTERING AND THE 6 He + p\nOPTICAL POTENTIAL\n\n-1\n\n10\n\nThe 6 He + p elastic scattering data obtained here complement the data measured at Dubna at the same energy\nin two differents runs [10, 22]. Fig. 4 shows the three\nsets of data which are in excellent agreement. These new\ndata allow to better determine the nuclear interaction potential 6 He + p, which is an essential ingredient for the\nanalysis of the transfer reaction, since it is necessary for\nthe entrance channel in the DWBA calculation. Previous results obtained on 6 He + p elastic scattering in the\nsame energy range have shown that the nucleon-nucleus\noptical models potentials used for stable nuclei have to\nbe modified in the case of loosely bound nuclei such as\n6\nHe [12, 23]. Coupling to the continuum and to the resonant states are expected to play a significant role since\nthe scattering states are much closer to the continuum\nstates than in stable nuclei. In this work, we tried two\napproaches to take into account these couplings to the\ncontinuum and thus the breakup effects. First, these effects were phenomenologically simulated by reducing the\nreal part of the potential or by adding a dynamical polarization potential as discussed in Ref. [23]. In this case,\nthe interaction potential 6 He + p was calculated within\nthe approach derived by Jeukenne, Lejeune and Mahaux\n(JLM) [24]. As seen in Fig. 4, this renormalization of the\nreal part of the JLM potential allows also to reproduce\nthe sets of data obtained at GANIL and Dubna reasonably well.\nIn a second approach, the coupling to the continuum was explicitly included by means of the coupleddiscretized-continuum-channels (CDCC) method. This\napproach previously used by Rusek et al. [12, 25] assumes\na two body cluster model \u03b1+2n for the 6 He nucleus with\nthe spin of the 2n cluster set to s=0. The wave functions\n\u03a80 (r ) and \u03a82 (r ) describing the relative motion of the\ntwo clusters in the 6 He ground state and the 6 He(2+ )\nresonant state were calculated in potential wells whose\ndepths were varied to reproduce respectively the binding energy of 0.975 MeV and the excitation energy of\n1.8 MeV. The parameters of these Woods-Saxon binding\npotentials are listed in Table I. The continuum above\nthe 6 He \u2192 \u03b1+2n breakup threshold was discretized into\na series of momentum bins with respect to the relative\n\u03b1-2n momentum k . The lowest bins were of \u2206k =0.25\nfm\u22121 while all the others were of \u2206k =0.2 fm\u22121 .

[22].\n\nreaction is not dominated by the Coulomb interaction.\nIn particular, the value of B (E2 ) depends on the choice\nof the neutron density distribution.\nBy inversion from the elastic channel S matrix, generated by the CDCC calculations, a local potential 6 He+p\nincluding the breakup effects, is obtained. The inversion is carried out using the iterative-perturbative (IP)\nmethod [30, 31]. The angular distribution calculated\nwithin the CDCC approach or with the local potential,\nnamed \u2032 Pot.

The reaction\ncross section for 6 He on proton has been measured at 36\nMeV/nucleon using the transmission method and a value\nof \u03c3 R = 409\u00b122 mb was obtained [32].

The effect of the triton sequential transfer (t =2n+p) was also investigated. The\nwave functions describing the relative motion of the two\nclusters \u03b1+2n, t +t , p+t and p+2n respectively in the\nground state of 6 He, 4 He and 3 H were obtained from\nWoods-Saxon potentials with the well depth adjusted to\nreproduce the corresponding binding energies, according\nto the usual separation energy prescription. The remnant\npotential Vp\u2212t was taken from Ref. [34] and the remnant\npotential V\u03b1\u2212p was determined in the previous section.\nAll the potentials and the spectroscopic amplitudes used\nin the calculation are listed in Table I and II.\nSpecial care was taken in the choice of the potential for\nthe \u03b1+t exit channel and several potentials were considered [10, 12, 13, 34, 35, 36]. To obtain the \u03b1+t potential,\nwe used \u03b1+3 He elastic scattering data at Ec.m. = 28.7\nMeV [37] as the 3 H(\u03b1,\u03b1)3 H reaction was not studied in\nthe energy range considered presently. Two approaches\nwere considered to extract the \u03b1+3 He optical potential.\nThe process of one neutron transfer, which is not distinguishable experimentally from the elastic scattering,\nwas first explicitly taken into account in a DWBA analysis of the 3 He(\u03b1,\u03b1)3 He reaction. The dotted and dashed\ncurves on Fig. 7 show respectively the contribution of the\nelastic scattering and the one neutron exchange to the\n\n\f6\n3\n\n10\n\nd\u03c3/d\u03a9 (mbarn/sr)\n\nHe(\u03b1,\u03b1)3 He reaction. Hence, the potential A extracted\nfrom the DWBA analysis represents only the elastic scattering between the \u03b1 and the 3 He. Next, we used the\npotential B obtained in Ref.[12] fitted on the complete\ndifferential cross section of the 3 He(4 He,4 He)3 He elastic\nscattering. This fit on the \u03b1+3 He data corresponds to\nthe solid line on Fig. 7. Although the fit is still far from\nperfect, it reproduces the gross features of the measured\nangular distribution.

The\nexperimental data are from Schwandt et al. [37].\n\nBoth the direct and the sequential transfer of the triton\nwere included in a DWBA calculation, described on Fig.\n6, and then in a coupled reaction channels calculation\n(CRC) where the backcouplings were taken into account.\nThe proton transfer, which is the second step of the triton sequential transfer, can be seen as a proton exchange\nbetween the two exit channels 3 H+\u03b1 and \u03b1+3 H and is\ndirectly included in the DWBA calculation. Hence, the\nexit channel potential \u03b1+3 H has not to take into account\nthe proton exchange but only the elastic scattering. This\ncorresponds to the potential A, as determined above, for\nthe exit channel. A comparison between a DWBA calculation with only the triton direct transfer and DWBA\nand CRC calculations including the sequential transfer\nt =2n+p is shown on Fig. 8. These calculations do not\nallow to reproduce at the same time the experimental\ndata at forward and backward angles. Futhermore, the\namplitude and/or the position of the oscillation at 60\u25e6 is\nnot reproduced.\nHence, we used Potential B for the exit channel of\nthe reaction, considering that the proton exchange in\n\nthe \u03b1+t partition, and consequently the sequential triton transfer, could be in some sense described by the\nexchange term included in the Potential B. Only the\n2n and the direct triton transfer are thus explicitly included in the DWBA calculation. Fig. 9 compares the\n6\nHe(p,t )4 He differential cross section obtained at GANIL\nwith the DWBA calculation using Potential IP for the\nentrance channel and Potential B for the exit channel,\nwhich gives actually the best description of the features\nof the 6 He(p,t )4 He angular distribution. The spectroscopic factors for the \u03b1+2n and t +t configurations were\nadjusted to reproduce the data. The adjustment on Fig.\n9 is a compromise between the experimental values at forward and backward angles and the width of the second\noscillation. The dashed line on Fig. 9 corresponds to the\nDWBA calculation where only the 2n transfer is taken\ninto account with a spectroscopic factor S\u03b1\u22122n equal to\n1, which is close to the predicted value. The spectroscopic factor St\u2212t , determined from the comparison with\nthe data at backward angles, is equal to 0.08 with an\nuncertainty of the order of 50%. The crosses on Fig. 9\ncorrespond only to the triton transfer. The solid line is\nthe coherent sum of the two processes with these values\nof their spectroscopic factors. Even if the spectroscopic\nfactor of the t +t clustering is small, the t -t component\nis essential to reproduce the backward angles.\nWe tried to include the sequential transfer of the two\nneutrons, processing via the 5 He+d channel. This calculation required the optical potential for the 5 He+d system. Of course, no deuton elastic scattering data exist\nfor this unbound nucleus. A first potential was obtained\nfrom the 6 He(p,d )5 He reaction [10]. The second potential was calculated from a method proposed by Keaton\n\n\f7\n\n6\n\n10\n\n4\n\nHe(p,t) He 150 MeV\nDWBA\nPot.

Obviously, the IP potential deduced\nfrom a coupled-discretized-continuum-channels calculation, where the couplings to the continuum are explicitly\ntaken into account, improves the description of the data\ncompared to the JLM approach.\nFig. 11 shows the dependence of the DWBA calculation with the value of the spectroscopic factor St\u2212t for 3\ncases: i) the value derived from the present work ii) the\nvalue obtained in the 3-body cluster model by K. Arai\net al. [7] and iii) finally the value from a translational\ninvariant shell model calculation [5]. It is clear that in\nthe present analysis, the two last values strongly overestimate the cross section measured at backward angles,\nand that the largest value even affects the reproduction of\nthe most forward angles of the data. The theoretical values are considerably outside the range of the uncertainty\nof the experimental data. The different approaches of\nanalysis performed within this work showed that the final results somewhat depend on the potentials used in\nthe calculation, especially in the exit channel potential.\nConsidering the difficulties mentioned previously on this\npotential, one can not exclude that another type of approach used to derive this potential could alter our conclusion.\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nThe 6 He(p,t )4 He reaction at 150 MeV has been investigated at GANIL in order to provide insight on the\n6\nHe cluster structure: the \u03b1+2n and di-triton configurations. The transfer differential cross section were mea-\n\n\f8\nsured with the SPEG spectrometer coupled to the MUST\narray. The transfer data obtained at forward and backward angles allowed to determine the spectroscopic factors S\u03b1\u22122n and St\u2212t and thus the contribution of the\nconfigurations \u03b1+2n and t +t to the 6 He ground state\nwave function. The 6 He(p,t )4 He data were analyzed by\nmeans of the DWBA and the coupled channels method\ntaking into account the direct 2n, the direct triton transfer and also the sequential transfer of the triton. The\n6\nHe+p entrance channel optical potential of these calculations was obtained by the inversion of the elastic\nchannel S matrix generated from a CDCC calculation\nwhich took into account all the couplings to the continuum states. This CDCC calculation, where the continuum above the \u03b1+2n threshold is discretized, reproduced the elastic 6 He(p,p)6 He, also measured in this experiment, and the 6 He(p,p')6 He inelastic data available\nat the same energy as the transfer reaction. A detailed\nstudy of the exit channel was performed. The difficulties encountered in this part of the analysis are related\nto the lack of 4 He+t elastic scattering data in the energy range considered presently, and to the strong effects of the neutron exchange in the 4 He+3 He system\nwhich was used instead. The best description of the experimental data was obtained with a DWBA calculation\n\ntaking into account the 2n and t direct transfer. The\ntriton sequential transfer is assumed to be directly included in the exchange term of the exit potential \u03b1+3 H.\nThe present work shows that the DWBA analysis of the\ntransfer data is strongly dependent on the chosen potentials. Nethertheless, the transfer data at backward angles\ncan only be reproduced with a spectroscopic factor St\u2212t\nwhich is much smaller than the theoretical values and\nthe t -t configuration is necessary for the description of\nthe 6 He ground state wave function.\n\n[1] P.
