This phase called \u03b2 brass has a B2 cubic structure\nwith two atoms per unit cell. At high temperatures the\nalloy forms a disordered body-centered cubic structure.\nThe disorder-order transition takes place around 730K.\nThe alloy satisfies the Hume-Rother\u00fd rules [3] and has\nthe same ratio of valence electrons to atoms. Jona and\nMarcus [1] have shown from a Density Functional Theory (DFT) based approach that within the Local Density Approximation (LDA), it is the body-centered based\nB2 which is the stable ground state. They also showed\nthat if we include the Gradient Corrections (GGA) then\nwe get a tetragonal ground state lower in energy by 0.1\nmRy/atom. This is in contradiction with the latest experimental data. The alloying of face-centered cubic Cu\nwith an equal amount of Zn leads to a body-centered\nstable phase. Zn has only one more electron than Cu.\nThis is an interesting phenomenon. CuZn alloys also\nhave anomalously high elastic anisotropy. This makes\nthe theoretical study of CuZn an interesting exercise for\na proposed theoretical technique. The phase diagram of\nCuZn is shown in Fig. 1.\nOne of the earliest first-principles Density functional\nbased study of the electronic properties of CuZn as by\nBansil [4]. The authors had studied the complex bands\nof \u03b1-phase of CuZn using the Korringa-Kohn-Rostocker\n(KKR) method coupled with the coherent potential approximation (CPA) to take care of disorder. They commented on the effects of charge transfer and lattice constants on the electronic structure. They found the elec-\n\n\u2217 Permanent\n\naddress : Ramakrishna Mission Vivekananda Centenary College, Rahara, West Bengal, India\n\nFIG. 1: Experimental phase diagram of CuZn alloy\n\ntronic distribution of this alloy to be of a split band kind\nwith the centers of the Cu and Zn d-bands well separated from each other. Their Zn d-bands showed hardly\nany dispersion and were shown only schematically in their\nfigures. In a later work Rowlands [5] generalized the CPA\nto a non-local version (NL-CPA) and studied the effects\nof short-ranged ordering in CuZn. Their technique was\nbased on an idea of renormalization in reciprocal space\nsuggested by Jarrel and Krishnamurthy [6].\nThe order-disorder transition in CuZn is a classical example of a true second order transition. Several very\nearly investigations on this alloy has been reviewed by\nNix and Shockley [7] and Guttman [8]. These investigations, of course, were rather crude, as sophisticated\napproaches to deal with disordered alloys had not really\nbeen developed at that time. However, it was recognized\nthat a knowledge of the short-ranged order correlations\nabove the critical temperature should be of considerable\ninterest. Early neutron scattering experiments were carried out on \u03b2-brass by Walker and Keating [9]. The\n\n\f2\nWarren-Cowley short-ranged order parameter, defined by\n\u03b1(R) = 1 \u2212 PAB (R)/x where x is the concentration of A,\nPAB (R) is the probability of finding an A atom at a distance of R from a B atom, was directly obtained from\nthe diffuse scattering cross-section :\nX\nd\u03c3\n= x(1 \u2212 x)(bA \u2212 bB )2\n\u03b1(R)f (K) exp(iK * R)\nd\u03a9\nR\n\nwhere bA , bB are the scattering lengths of A and B atoms,\nand f (K) = exp(\u2212C|K|2 ) is the attenuation factor arising from thermal vibrations and static strains. The experimental data for the short-ranged order parameter as\na function of temperature are thus available to us. A\nIsing-like model using pair interactions was studied by\nWalker and Chipman [10] and the short-ranged order\nwas theoretically obtained. However, the pair interactions were simply fitted to the experimental values of the\ntransition temperature TC and in that sense it was an\nempirical theory. The experimental estimate of the nearest neighbour Warren-Cowley parameter was found to be\nvarying between -0.171 to -0.182 at around 750K.\nIn a later work using the much more sophisticated locally\nself-consistent Green function (LSGF) approach based on\nthe tight-binding linear muffin-tin orbital (TB-LMTO)\ntechnique Abrikosov et.al. [11] studied CuZn alloys. The\nauthors argued that earlier studies of the mixing enthalpies of CuZn using the standard coherent potential approximation approaches [12]-[16] showed significant discrepancy with experiment. Part of the discrepancy was assumed to be from neglect of charge transfer\neffects and part from the effects of short ranged ordering (SRO). The main thrust of this technique, which was\nbased on an earlier idea of a locally self-consistent multiple scattering (LSMS) by Wang et.al. [17], was to go\nbeyond the CPA and include the effects of the immediate environment of an atom in the solid. The LSMS gave\nan excellent theoretical estimate of the ordering energy\nin CuZn : 3.37 MRy/atom as compared to the experimental value of 3.5 MRy/atom. The LSGF approach\ncorrectly predicted ordering tendency in CuZn on lowering temperature and combing with a Cluster VariationConnolly Williams (CVM-CW) obtained a value of the\nnearest neighbour Warren-Cowley SRO parameter \u03b1 =\n-0.15. Subsequently Bruno et.al. [18] proposed a modification of the CPA taking into account the local field\nand showed that charge transfer effects can be taken into\naccount accurately as compared to the O(N) methods\njust described. They applied their approach to the CuZn\nalloys.\nOne of the earlier works on the optical property of CuZn\nalloy was the determination of the temperature variation\nof spectral reflectivity by Muldawer [19]. The author attempted to explain the color of the disordered \u03b2-brass\nCuZn alloy via the internal photoelectric effect [20]. Al-\n\nthough, the experimental data also contained the contribution from plasma oscillations, the author claimed that\nthe spectral reflectivity helps to explain the band picture\nof the alloys as a function of the inter-atomic spacing. In\norder to explain the optical properties, Amar et.al. [21][23] studied the band structure of CuZn using the KKR\nmethod. However, they had used the virtual crystal approximation, replacing the random potential seen by the\nelectrons by an averaged one. This is now known to be\nparticularly inaccurate for split band alloys.\nThe above discussion was necessary to bring into focus\nthe following points : in the study of alloys like CuZn it\nwould be interesting to address the effects of charge transfer and short-ranged ordering. In this communication we\nshall address exactly these two points. We shall propose\nthe use of the augmented space recursion (ASR) coupled with the tight-binding linear muffin-tin orbitals basis (TB-LMTO) [24] to study the effects of short-ranged\nordering on both the electronic structure and the optical properties of \u03b2-CuZn alloy at 50-50 composition. We\nshould like to stress here that the TB-LMTO-ASR addresses precisely these effects with accuracy : the Density functional self-consistent TB-LMTO takes care of\nthe charge transfer, while the local environmental effects\nwhich are essential for the description of SRO are dealt\nwith by the ASR. The TB-LMTO-ASR and its advantages has been extensively discussed earlier by Mookerjee [25] and in a series of articles [24, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30].\nWe would like to refer the interested readers to these for\ndetails.\n\nSPECTRAL FUNCTIONS, COMPLEX BANDS\nAND DENSITY OF STATES FOR 50-50 CUZN\n\nIn this section we shall introduce the salient features of\nthe ASR which will be required by us in our subsequent\ndiscussions.\nWe shall start from a first principle TB-LMTO set of\norbitals [31, 32] in the most-localized \u03b1 representation.\nThis is necessary, because the subsequent recursion requires a sparse representation of the Hamiltonian. In\nthis representation, the second order alloy Hamiltonian\nis given by,\n\nH(2) = E\u03bd + h \u2212 hoh\nwhere,\nh=\n\nX\nR\n\no=\n\nX\nR\n\n(CR \u2212 E\u03bdR ) PR +\noR PR\n\nXX\nR\n\nR\u2032\n\n1/2\n\n1/2\n\n\u2206R SRR\u2032 \u2206R\u2032 TRR\u2032\n(1)\n\n\f3\nCR , E\u03bdR , \u2206R and oR are diagonal matrices in angular momentum space, and SRR\u2032 is the structure matrix.\nThese matrices are of rank Lmax .

The atom sitting at {R} can either be of\ntype A (nR = 1) with probability x or B (nR = 0) with\nprobability y, where x and y are the concentrations of\nthe components A and B in the binary alloy. The augmented space formalism (ASF) now introduces the space\nof configurations of the set of binary random variables\n{nR } : \u03a6.

The coefficients are calculated exactly up to a finite number of\nsteps {\u03b1n , \u03b2n } for n < N and the asymptotic part of the\ncontinued fraction is obtained from the initial set of coefficients using the idea of Beer and Pettifor terminator\n[34]. Haydock and coworkers [35] have carried out extensive studies of the errors involved and precise estimates\nare available in the literature.

The operation\nof the effective Hamiltonian is thus entirely in the configuration space and the calculation does not involve the\nspace H at all. This is an enormous simplification over\nthe standard augmented space recursion [24, 28, 29, 30],\nwhere the entire reduced real space part as well as the\nconfiguration part were involved in the recursion process.\nEarlier we had to resort to symmetry reduction of this\nenormous space in order to make the recursion tractable.\nHere the rank of only the configuration space is much\nsmaller and we may further reduce it by using the local\nsymmetries of the configuration space, as described in\nour earlier letter [24]. However, this advantage is offset\nby the fact that the effective Hamiltonian is energy dependent. This means that to obtain the Green functions\nwe have to carry out the recursion for each energy point.\nThis process is simplified by carrying out recursion over\na suitably chosen set of seed energies and interpolating\nthe values of the coefficients across the band.\nThe self-energy which arises because of scattering by the\nrandom potential fluctuations is of the form :\n2\n\u03b22L\n(k)\n\n\u03a3L (k, z) =\nz \u2212 \u03b12L (k) \u2212\n\n2\n\u03b23L\n(k)\n..\n.\nz \u2212 \u03b1N L (k) \u2212 \u0393L (k, z)\n\n.\n\nSo the continued fraction can be written in the form\n1/(z \u2212 \u1ebcL (k) \u2212 \u03a3L (k, E)), where \u1ebcL (k) = \u03b11L (k).\nThe average spectral function \u226a Ak (E) \u226b is related to\nthe averaged Green function in reciprocal space as :\n\u226a Ak (E) \u226b =\n\nX\nL\n\n\u226a AkL (E) \u226b,\n\nwhere\n\u226a AkL (E) \u226b = \u2212\n\n1\nlim {Im \u226a GLL (k, E \u2212 i\u03b4) \u226b}.\n\u03c0 \u03b4\u21920+\n\nTo obtain the complex bands for the alloy we fix a value\nfor k and solve for :\nz \u2212 \u1ebcL (k) \u2212 \u03a3L (k, E) = 0.\nThe real part of the roots will give the position of the\nbands, while the imaginary part of roots will be proportional to the lifetime. Since the alloy is random, the\nbands always have finite lifetimes and are fuzzy.\n\nWe have used this reciprocal space ASR to obtain the\ncomplex bands and spectral functions for the CuZn alloy. This is shown in Figs. (2) - (3). It should be noted\nthat we have carried out a fully LDA self-consistent calculation using the TB-LMTO-ASR developed by us [37]\nto obtain the potential parameters. It takes care of the\ncharge transfer effects. For the Madelung energy part\nof the alloy calculation, we have chosen the approach of\nRuban and Skriver [38].\nThe two panels of Fig. (2) compare the band structures\nof pure Cu and pure Zn metals in the same bcc lattice\nas the 50-50 alloy. We note that the s-like bands of Cu\nand Zn stretch from -0.8 Ry.,while the d-like states of\nZn and Cu, whose degeneracies are lifted by the cubic\nsymmetry of the bcc lattice are more localized and reside\nin the neighbourhood of -0.6 Ry. and between -0.3 to 0.2 Ry. respectively. The complex bands of the solid\nclearly reflect the same band structure. However, the\nbands are slightly shifted and broadened because of the\ndisorder scattering of Bloch states in the disordered alloy.\nThe scattering lifetimes are maximum for the Cu d-like\nbands, less for the Zn d-like bands and minimum for the\nlower s-like bands. This is expected, since the delocalized\ns-like states straddle large volumes of the lattice space\nand are therefore less sensitive to the local configuration\nfluctuations of the substitutional alloy.\nThe same is reflected in the spectral functions, shown\nhere also along the \u0393-X direction in the Brillouin zone.\nSharp peaks stretching from -0.8 Ry., groups of wider\npeaks around -0.6 Ry. with less dispersion, characteristic of the more localized d-like states and groups of much\nwider peaks straddling -0.3\u20130.2 Ry. also with less dispersion. The spectral functions play an important role in\nresponse functions related to photoemmission and optical conductivity [58]. Our complex bands agree remarkably well with the Fig.3 of Bansil and Ehrenreich [4].\nThese authors of course did not show the dispersion of\nthe Zn d-bands, but as in their work, the Cu bands show\ngreater disorder induced lifetimes than the lower energy\nZn d-bands.\nWe may use the generalized tetrahedron method to pass\nfrom the reciprocal space spectral functions to the real\nspace density of states [59]. Alternatively, we may also\ncarry out real-space ASR to obtain the density of states\ndirectly.\nFig. (4) shows the densities of states for the pure Zn\n(solid lines) and Cu (dashed lines) in the same bcc lattice as the alloy and compares this with the ordered B2\nand disordered bcc 50-50 CuZn alloy. We first note that\nin the ordered B2 alloy there is a considerable narrowing of the Zn well as the Cu d-like bands. The feature\naround -0.3 Ry. is suppressed in the ordered alloy. In\nthe disordered alloy on the other hand, although disorder scattering introduces life-time effects which washes\nout the sharp structures in the ordered systems, the re-\n\n\f0\n\n0\n\n-0.2\n\n-0.2\n\nEnergy (Ryd.)\n\nEnergy (Ryd.)\n\n6\n\n-0.4\n\n-0.4\n\n-0.6\n\n-0.6\n\n-0.8\n\n-0.8\n\u0393\n\nN\n\n\u0393\n\nX\n\nFIG. 2: (left) Bands for pure Cu and Zn in bcc lattices with the same lattice parameter as the 50-50 CuZn alloy.

The CPA being a single site\nmean-field approximation cannot take into account SRO\nas it spans at least a nearest neighbour cluster on the\nlattice. The early attempts at cluster-generalizations of\nthe CPA were beset with difficulties of violation of the\nanalytic properties of the approximated configuration averaged Green function. Tsukada's [39] idea of introducing\na super-cell the size of the cluster in an effective medium\nsuffered from the problem of broken translational symmetry within the cluster even when the disorder was homogeneous. This same problem beset the CCPA's proposed\nby Kumar et.al. [40] based on the augmented space theorem introduced by Mookerjee [26]. The embedded cluster method of Gonis et.al. [42] immersed a cluster in a\nCPA medium which lacked the full self-consistency with\nit. The first, translationally symmetric cluster approximations which preserved the analytic properties of the\napproximate Green functions were all based on the augmented space theorem of Mookerjee [26]. They included\nthe travelling cluster approximation (TCA) of Kaplan\nand Gray [27] and Mills and Ratnavaraksa [44] and the\nCCPA proposed by Razee et.al. [45]. The problem with\nthese approaches was that they became intractable as\nthe size of the cluster considered was increased much beyond two sites. Mookerjee and Prasad [46] generalized\nthe augmented space theorem to include correlated disorder. However, since they then went on to apply it in\nthe CCPA approximation, they could not go beyond the\n\n\f80\n\nDensity of states (states/atom-Ry)\n\nPure Zn\nPure Cu\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n-0.8\n\n-0.6\n\n-0.4\nEnergy (Ry.)\n\n-0.2\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n80\n\nOrdered CuZn\n\n60\n\n40\n\n20\n\n0\n-0.8\n\n-0.6\n\n-0.4\n\n-0.2\n\nEnergy (Ry.)\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\nDensity of states (states/atom-Ry)\n\nDensity of states (states/atom-Ry)\n\n7\n60\n\nDisordered CuZn\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20\n\n10\n\n0\n-0.8\n\n-0.6\n\n-0.4\n\n-0.2\n\nEnergy (Ry.)\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\nFIG. 4: (left) Density of states of pure Zn (solid lines) and Cu (dashed lines)in the same bcc lattice as the 50-50 CuZn alloy.\n(centre) Density of states for ordered B2 50-50 CuZn alloy.

The\nbreakthrough came with the augmented space recursion\n(ASR) approach proposed by Saha et.al. [47]-[48]. The\nmethod was a departure from the mean-field approaches\nwhich always began by embedding a cluster in an effective\nmedium which was then obtained self-consistently. Here\nthe Green function was expanded in a continued fraction\nwhose asymptotic part was obtained from its initial steps\nthrough an ingenious termination procedure [33]. In this\nmethod the effect at a site of quite a large environment\naround it could be taken into account depending how far\none went down the continued fraction before termination.\nThe technique was made fully LDA-self-consistent within\nthe tight-binding linear muffin-tin orbitals (TB-LMTO)\napproach [49] and several applications have been carried\nout to include short-ranged order in different alloy systems [50]. Recently Leath and co-workers have developed\nan itinerant CPA (ICPA) based on the augmented space\ntheorem [51], which also maintains both analyticity and\ntranslational symmetry and takes into account effect of\nthe nearest neighbour environment of a site in an alloy.\nThe technique has been very successfully applied to the\nphonon problem in alloys where there were large force\nconstant disorders. This method matches well with the\nASR approach to the same alloys [52] and there is now a\nconcerted effort to apply it to electronic problems based\n\non both the TB-KKR and the TB-LMTO methods. A\nvery different and rather striking approach has been developed by Rowlands et.al. [53] (the non-local CPA or\nNL-CPA) using the idea of coarse graining in reciprocal\nspace originally proposed by Jarell and Krishnamurthy\n[6]. The NL-CPA with SRO has been applied earlier by\nRowlands et.al. [5] and is on the verge of being made fully\nDFT self-consistent within the KKR. The authors report\nan unpublished report on it [54]. In this communication\nwe report a fully DFT self-consistent ASR based on the\nTB-LMTO with SRO incorporated. We have applied it\nto the case of 50-50 CuZn alloys, so as to have a comparison with earlier attempts using different techniques.\n\nTHE GENERALIZED AUGMENTED SPACE\nTHEOREM\n\nThe generalized augmented space theorem has been described in detail by Mookerjee and Prasad [46]. Let us\nbriefly introduce those essential ideas which are necessary\nto make this communicated reasonably self-contained.\nFor a substitutionally binary disordered alloy Ax By on a\nlattice we can introduce a set of random occupation variables {nR } associated with the lattice sites labelled by\nR, which take the values 0 or 1 depending upon whether\n\n\f8\nthe site R is occupied by a A or a B type of atom. The\nHamiltonian and hence the Green function are both functions of this set of random variables. The configuration\naveraged Green operator is then :\n\n\u226a G(z, {nR }) \u226b =\n\nZ\n\n...\n\nZ Y\nR\n\ndnR G(z, {nR }) P ({nR })\n\nTo start with, let us assume that short-ranged order extends up to nearest neighbours only. Let us take for an\nexample the nearest neighbour cluster of nine atoms on\na body centered cubic lattice (see Fig. 5) centered on the\nsite labelled by i = 0. Let us concentrate on the central\natom (labelled 0). The occupation variables associated\nwith its eight neighbours are correlated with n1 , but not\nwith one another. Further none of the other occupation\nvariables associated with more distant sites are correlated\nwith n1 . If we label any other site k as 0, that is carry\nout a lattice translation from the site i to k, its environment is identical to the earlier situation. Therefore the\nsubsequent procedure is translationally symmetric, as it\nshould be, if the SRO is itself homogeneous. We may\nthen write :\n\nP (n0 , n2 , . . . nk . . .) = P (n0 )\n\n8\nY\n\nj=1\n\nP (nj |n1 )\n\nY\n\nP (nk )\n\nk>8\n\nThe generalized Augmented Space Theorem then associates with the random variables {nk } corresponding opf k } in their configuration space.

If we translate this site to any other and\napply the lattice translation to all the sites, hence the\nHamiltonian in the full augmented space, remains unchanged. This formulation of short ranged order also possesses lattice translational symmetry, provided the shortranged order is homogeneous in space.\n\ntendency, both the split bands narrow and lose structure.\nThe feature around -0.3 Ry. disappears. This band narrowing and suppression of the feature around -0.3 Ry. is\nclearly seen in the ordered B2 alloy shown in Fig. (4).\nOur analysis is closely similar to that of Rowlands et.al.\n[5]. However, there are quantitative differences as both\nthe basic technique (KKR and TB-LMTO) and the approximations are quantitatively different. Finally, in Fig.\n8 we show the band energy as a function of the nearest\nneighbour Warren-Cowley parameter. The minimum occurs at the ordering end, as expected. Experimentally\nthe alloy does show a tendency to order at lower temperatures.\n\nOPTICAL PROPERTIES OF CUZN ALLOYS\nEFFECT OF SRO ON THE DENSITY OF STATES\n\nWe have carried out the TB-LMTO-ASR calculations on\nCuZn with a lattice constant of 2.85 \u00c5. The Cu and Zn\npotentials are self-consistently obtained via the LDA selfconsistency loop. All reciprocal space integrals are done\nby using the generalized tetrahedron integration for disordered systems introduced by us earlier [59].\nTo discuss the effect of SRO, leading, on one hand, to\nordering (\u03b1 < 0) and segregation on the other (\u03b1 > 0),\nlet us first look at Figs. 2 and 4. The complex band\nstructure shown in Fig. 2 shows that the system is a\nsplit band alloy. The positions of the d-bands of Cu and\nZn are well separated in energy. This implies that the\n\"electrons travel more easily between Cu or between Zn\nsites than between unlike ones\" [5]. So when the alloy\norders and unlike sites sit next to each other, the overlap\nintegral between the like sites decrease. This leads to a\nnarrowing of the bands associated with Cu and Zn. A\ncomparison between the leftmost and central panels of\nFig. 4 shows that the bandwidths in the latter are almost half of the former. This should be the main effect\nof ordering setting in. On the other hand, when the alloy\nis completely disordered, the bands gets widened by disorder scattering and the sharp structures in the density\nof states are smoothened.\nFig (6) shows the density of states with increasing positive \u03b1. Positive \u03b1 indicates a clustering tendency. Comparing with Fig. (4) we note that as clustering tendency\nincreases the density of states begins to show the structures seen in the pure metals in both the split bands. For\nlarge positive \u03b1 there is still residual long-ranged disorder. This causes smoothening of the bands with respect\nto the pure materials. For these large, positive \u03b1s, we\nnotice the development of the structure around -0.3Ry.\nFig. (7) shows the density of states with increasing negative \u03b1 which indicates increasing ordering tendency. On\nthe bcc lattice at 50-50 composition we expect this ordering to favour a B2 structure. With increasing ordering\n\nIn an earlier work [55] we had developed a methodology\nfor the calculation of configuration averaged optical conductivity of a disordered alloy based on the augmented\nspace formalism. Here we shall present the salient features required for the calculation of optical response functions in the 50-50 CuZn alloy.\nIn linear response theory, at zero temperature, the generalized susceptibility of a disordered alloy is given by the\nKubo formula :\n\n\u03bc\n\nhj (t)i =\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u03c7\u03bc\u03bd (t \u2212 t\u2032 ) A\u03bd (t\u2032 )\n\nwhere, A\u03bd (t) is the vector potential, and\n\u03c7\u03bc\u03bd (t \u2212 t\u2032 ) = (i/~) \u0398(t \u2212 t\u2032 ) h[j\u03bc (t)j\u03bd (t\u2032 )]i\nj\u03bc is the current operator and \u0398 is the Heaviside step\nfunction. If the underlying lattice has cubic symmetry,\n\u03c7\u03bc\u03bd = \u03c7 \u03b4\u03bc\u03bd . The fluctuation dissipation theorem then\nrelates the imaginary part of the Laplace transform of\nthe generalized susceptibility to the Laplace transform of\na correlation function :\n\u03c7\u2032\u2032 (\u03c9) = (1/2~) (1 \u2212 exp{\u2212\u03b2~\u03c9}) S(\u03c9)\nwhere,\n\nS(\u03c9) =\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u221e\n\ndt exp{i(\u03c9 + i\u03b4)t} Tr\n\n\u0010\n\nj\u03bc (t) j\u03bc (0)\n\n\u0011\n\n(15)\n\nSince the response function is independent of the direction label \u03bc for cubic symmetry, in the following we shall\ndrop this symbol. In case of other symmetries we have\nto generalize our results for different directions.

This augmented current operator is used to construct the starting state of the recursion as described in the last section.\nSince the real part of the dielectric function \u01eb1 (\u03c9) can\nbe now obtained from the imaginary part \u01eb2 (\u03c9) using a\nKramers Kr\u00f6nig relationship, we know the full complex\ndielectric function. All optical response functions may\nnow be derived from these.

If we examine the density of states\nfor both the ordered and disordered alloys we note that\nit is only around or just above ~\u03c9 \u2243 0.1 Ry that the\ntransitions from the d-bands of Cu begin to contribute\nto \u01eb2 (\u03c9). Below this energy, the behaviour is Drude like.\nThis is clearly seen in the panels of the figure. As \u03b1 increases and the alloy tends to segregate, since the weight\nof the structure in the density of states nearer to the\nFermi-energy, increases, this contribution leads to the increasing weight of the structure near 0.1 Ry.\nFig. 9 (bottom panel) shows the variation of \u01eb2 (\u03c9) with\nthe nearest neighbour Warren-Cowley SRO parameter\nshowing increased ordering tendency. The narrowing of\nthe band with ordering and the increase of weightage to\nthe structure away from the Fermi energy is clearly reflected in the dielectric function. It is also obvious from\nthe figures that the imaginary part of the dielectric function is more sensitive to the variation of short-ranged\norder than the density of states.\n\n\f13\n\n\u03b1=0.0\n\n4\n\n\u03b1=0.2\n\n\u03b1=0.4\n\n3\n2\n1\n\n\u03b52\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n\u03b1=0.6\n\n4\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n\u03b1=0.8\n\n0.2\n\n\u03b1=1.0\n\n3\n2\n1\n0\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\nEnergy (Ry.)\n\n7\n6\n\n\u03b1=0.0\n\n\u03b1= \u22120.2\n\n\u03b1= \u22120.6\n\n\u03b1= \u22120.8\n\n\u03b1= \u22120.4\n\n5\n4\n3\n2\n\n\u03b52\n\n1\n0\n7\n6\n\n\u03b1= \u22121.0\n\n5\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\nEnergy (Ry.)\n\nFIG. 9: (Top panel)Imaginary part of the dielectric function as a function of energy and its variation with the nearest neighbour\nWarren-Cowley SRO parameter,\u03b1 > 0 increasing, indicating segregating tendency.

In particular as these alloys\nare coloured and the changes can be observed visually.\nA study of the changes in spectral reflectivity due to ordering or segregation would be interesting. The colour\nof these alloys should be due to the same physical mechanism of internal photoelectric excitations, as proposed\nfor coloured metals like Cu and Au. Of course, we should\ntake care of plasma effects and other phenomena that together and in a combined way give rise to colour. However, it would be, as an initial study, examine the effect\nof SRO on the spectral reflectivity of the alloy. This is\nsown in Fig. 10.\nThe first thing we note that for the completely disordered\n\nalloy the reflectivity has a maximum around \u03bb =5200 \u00c5\nwhich is not very different from that of Cu at low temperatures and is in the Yellow-Green region. Below this\nthe reflectivity sharply drops (the reflectivity edge) and\nlight of lower wavelengths is not reflected. With increasing segregation tendency this maximum drops almost linearly with \u03b1 to around 4950 \u00c5 which is towards the green\nrange. On the other hand with increasing ordering tendency the maximum moves out towards 5600\u00c5 which\nmoves towards the yellow from the yellow-green wavelengths. We would expect then a shift from a yellowgreen colour in the disordered to a more yellow region in\nthe ordered material. We should note that these calculations are all done at 0K. In an actual experiment the\ndisorder-order transition takes place with varying tem-\n\n\f14\n\nReflectivity ( R )\n\n\u03b1 = 0.0\n\n\u03b1 = 0.8\n\n\u03b1 = 0.6\n\n4000\n\n4500\n\n5000\n\n5500\n\n\u03b1=0.4\n\n\u03b1 = 0.2\n\n6000 4000\n\n4500\n\n5000\n\n5500\n\n6000 4000\n\n\u03b1 =1.0\n\n4500\n\n5000\n\n5500\n\n6000\n\n5500\n\n6000\n\n0\n\nWavelength ( A )\n\n4500\n\n5000\n\nReflectivity ( R )\n\n\u03b1 = \u2212 1.0\n\n\u03b1 = \u2212 0.8\n\n\u03b1 = \u2212 0.6\n\n4000\n\n\u03b1 = \u2212 0.4\n\n\u03b1 = \u2212 0.2\n\n\u03b1 = 0.0\n\n5500\n\n6000 4000\n\n4500\n\n5000\n\n5500\n\n6000 4000\n\n4500\n\n5000\n\n0\n\nWavelength ( A )\n\nFIG. 10: (Top panel)Reflectivity as a function of the wavelength and its variation with the nearest neighbour Warren-Cowley\nparameter \u03b1 > 0 increasing indicating segregating tendency.
