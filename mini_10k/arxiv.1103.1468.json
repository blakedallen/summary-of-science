This is known in physics as Plateau's\nproblem. Recall that a most simple version of Plateau's problem aims at finding a surface which\nminimizes area among all the surfaces having a given curve as boundary. See works of Besicovitch,\nFederer, Fleming, De Giorgi, Douglas, etc. for example.\nLots of notions of minimality have been introduced to modernize Plateau's problem, such as\nminimal surfaces, mass minimizing or size minimizing currents (see [18] for their definitions), varifold\n(c.f.[2]). In this article, we will mainly use the notion introduced by F.Almgren [3], in a general setting\nof sets, and which gives a very good description of the behavior of soap films. Note that soap films are\n\n1\n\n\f2-dimensional objects, but a general definition of d\u2212dimensional minimal sets in an open set U \u2282 Rn\nis not more complicated.\nIntuitively, a d\u2212dimensional minimal set E in an open set U \u2282 Rn is a closed set E whose\nd\u2212dimensional Hausdorff measure could not be decreased by any local Lipschitz deformation. (See\nSection 1.2 for the precise definition.)\nThe point of view here is very different from those of minimal surfaces and mass minimizing\ncurrents under certain boundary condition, which are more usually used. Comparing to the big\nnumber of results in the theory of mass minimizing currents, or classical minimal surface, in our case,\nvery little results of regularity and existence are known. However, Plateau's problem is more like the\nstudy of size minimizing currents, for which much less results are known either (see [17] for certain\nexistence results). One can prove that the support of a size minimizing current is automatically an\nAlmgren minimizer, so that all the regularity results listed below are also true for supports of size\nminimizing currents.\nFirst regularity results for minimal sets have been given by Frederick Almgren [3] (rectifiability,\nAhlfors regularity in arbitrary dimension), then generalized by Guy David and Stephen Semmes [7]\n(uniform rectifiability, big pieces of Lipschitz graphs), Guy David [4] (minimality of the limit of a\nsequence of minimizers).\nSince minimal sets are rectifiable and Ahlfors regular, they admit a tangent plane at almost every\npoint. But our main interest is to study those points where there is no tangent plane, i.e. singular\npoints.\nA first finer description of the interior regularity for minimal sets is due to Jean Taylor, who gave\nin [20] an essential regularity theorem for 2-dimensional minimal sets in 3-dimensional ambient spaces:\nif E is a minimal set of dimension 2 in an open set of R3 , then every point x of E has a neighborhood\nwhere E is equivalent (modulo a negligible set) through a C 1 diffeomorphism to a minimal cone (that\nis, a minimal set which is also a cone).\nIn [5], Guy David generalized Jean Taylor's theorem to 2-dimensional minimal sets in Rn , but with\na local bi-H\u00f6lder equivalence, that is, every point x of E has a neighborhood where E is equivalent\nthrough a bi-H\u00f6lder diffeomorphism to a minimal cone C (but the minimal cone might not be unique).\nIn addition, in [6], David also proved that, if this minimal cone C satisfies a \"full-length\" condition,\nwe will have the C 1 equivalence (called C 1 regularity). In particular, the tangent cone of E at the\npoint x \u2208 E exists and is a minimal cone, and the blow-up limit of E at x is unique; if the full-length\ncondition fails, we might lose the C 1 regularity.\nThus, the study of singular points is transformed into the classification of singularities, i.e., into\nlooking for a list of minimal cones. Besides, getting such a list would also help deciding locally what\nkind (i.e. C 1 or bi-H\u00f6lder) of equivalence with a minimal cone can we get.\n2\n\n\fA. Skew quadrilateral.\n\nB. Mobius band.\n\nIn R3 , the list of 2-dimensional minimal cones has been given by several mathematicians a century\nago. (See for example [11] or [10]). They are, modulo isomorphism: a plane, a Y set (the union of 3\nhalf planes that meet along a straight line where they make angles of 120 degrees), and a T set (the\nCatenoid.\nD. Catenoid with disk.\ncone over the 1-skeleton of a regular tetrahedron centeredC.at\nthe origin). See the pictures\nbelow.\n\nE. Tetrahedral film.\n\nF. Trefoil knot film.\n\nIn higher dimensions, even in dimension 4, the list of minimal cones is still very far from clear.\nFigure 1. Various soap film examples. (Section 2.1)\n\nExcept for those three minimal cones that already exists in R3 , the only 2-dimensional minimal cone\nthat was known before this paper is the union of two orthogonal planes, whose minimality could be\nproved by a simple projection argument.\nIt was not even known whether this is the only minimal cone with this shape, i.e., as a union of\ntwo planes.\nNote that in R3 , no small perturbation of any minimal cones ever preserves the minimality, and\neven, each minimal cone admits a different topology from the others. But in this article we will show\nthe following theorem, which exhibits a phenomenon that does not exist in R3 :\nTheorem 1.1. There exists a continuous one-parameter family of 2-dimensional minimal cones Rn\nfor n \u2265 4.\nIn fact, we are going to prove the following more precise theorem, of which Theorem 1.1 is a direct\nbut noticeable corollary.\nTheorem 1.2 (minimality of the union of two almost orthogonal planes). There exists 0 < \u03b8 <\n\n\u03c0\n2,\n\nsuch that if P 1 and P 2 are two planes in R4 whose characteristic angles (\u03b11 , \u03b12 ) satisfy \u03b12 \u2265 \u03b11 \u2265 \u03b8,\nthen their union P 1 \u222a P 2 is a minimal cone in R4 .\nThe characteristic angles of two planes P 1 , P 2 describe their relative position, the definition will\nbe given in Section 2. But an equivalent statement of Theorem 1.2 that might be easier to understand\nis that any almost orthogonal union of two planes in R4 is minimal, i.e. there exists a > 0, such that\nif for any v1 \u2208 P 1 , v2 \u2208 P 2 ,\n(1.3)\n\n| < v1 , v2 > | \u2264 a||v1 ||||v2 ||\n\nthen P 1 \u222a P 2 is minimal. Or intuitively, there is an \"open set\" of unions of two planes, which contains\nthe orthogonal union of two planes, such that each element in this set (which is a union of two planes)\nis a minimal cone.\n3\n\n\fWhen a is small, (1.3) is almost equivalent to saying that \u03b11 , \u03b12 >\n\n\u03c0\n2\n\n\u2212 Ca. Hence we really have\n\n1\n\na one parameter family of minimal cones (which are not C equivalent), whose intersections with the\nunit ball have the same Hausdorff measure.\nMoreover, it is not hard to check that each cone in this one parameter family verifies the \"fulllength property\", hence by Thm 1.15 of [6], if a blow-up limit of a minimal set E at a point x is one\nof these unions of planes P\u03b1 , then locally E is C 1 equivalent to P\u03b1 .\nThis is also a general question for unions of higher dimensional planes. Unions of orthogonal planes\nare always minimal, but for non-orthogonal cases we know very little. Some new information can be\ngiven, using the arguments and results of this paper and the notion of topological minimal sets, see\n[14].\nFor the proof of the theorem, the argument is not simply a perturbation analysis. Due to the higher\ncodimension and the lack of results for minimal sets in R4 , the classical methods (such as calibration,\nslicing) for proving minimality do not apply, hence we are obliged to use tools in harmonic analysis,\nwhich are rarely used to prove minimality results. In particular, we use a stopping time argument to\ndivide minimal sets into good and bad parts, and we treat them differently (projection for the bad\npart, harmonic extension for the good part), to get the estimates for their Hausdorff measure. It\nwould also be much simpler if we had the existence results for minimal sets, because this would allow\nus to do directly the stopping time argument. However we can only use a partial existence result of\n[9]. We use it to get some sort of minimal set, and we have to prove some necessary regularity for\nit, so that the stopping time argument can be carried on well. Some of the arguments, especially the\ngeometric constructions, are somehow painful. But we have not found any other easier way to do it.\nRemark 1.4. 1) To the author's knowledge, the only proof of minimality that does not use a calibration\nargument (probably not available here) is the proof of minimality for the cone T , suggested by J.Taylor\nin [20], using a topological argument, and the list of all the other minimal cones. But in our case the\ntopology is more complicated, existence results are weaker, and moreover the list of the other minimal\ncones are far from known.\n2) Frank Morgan gave a conjecture in [16] on the angle condition (which is imposed on the sum of\nthe two characteristic angles) under which a union of two planes is minimal. It was proved by Gary\nLawlor [12] that if the sum of their two characteristic angles is less than\n\n2\u03c0\n3 ,\n\nthen the union of the\n\ntwo planes will not be minimal. The remaining part is still open.\nOur theorem also solves partially the remaining part of this conjecture, because if \u03b11 + \u03b12 >\n\n\u03c0\n2\n\n+\u03b8\n\n(\u03b8 is as in Theorem 1.2), then we'll have \u03b12 \u2265 \u03b11 > \u03b8 (since both of them are no more than \u03c0/2),\nand Theorem 1.2 implies that the union of two planes with this pair of angles is minimal.\n\nThe strategy of the proof of Theorem 1.2 is the following.\n4\n\n\fSince our objects are cones centered at the origin, to prove that their measure could not be\ndecreased by any deformation in any compact set in Rn (which is the definition for minimal sets, see\nSubsection 1.1 for the precise definition), we can just look at deformations in the unit ball B = B(0, 1).\nFor \u03b8 = (\u03b81 , \u03b82 ), denote by P\u03b8 the union of two planes with characteristic angles \u03b8. We begin by\nverifying that P( \u03c02 , \u03c02 ) is minimal, and moreover is the only minimal set in the unit ball among all sets\nwith the same boundary and surjective orthogonal projections on the two planes. Here the boundary\nof a set is just the intersection of its closure with the unit sphere.\nNext we begin to prove Theorem 1.2. Suppose the conclusion of the theorem is false. Then there\nexists a sequence {\u03b8k } which converges to \u03b80 := ( \u03c02 , \u03c02 ), such that P\u03b8k is not minimal. Set Pk = P\u03b8k ,\nand P0 = P01 \u222a\u03b80 P02 = P01 \u222a\u22a5 P02 . So we have\n(1.5)\n\ninf{H 2 (F ) : F \u2282 B(0, 1) is a deformation of Pk in B} < H 2 (Pk \u2229 B) = 2\u03c0.\n\nThe next step would be easier if we could find, for each k, a deformation Ek of Pk in B which\nminimizes H 2 (E \u2229 B) among all deformations E of Pk in B. Unfortunately, no such existence theorem\nis known.\nHowever, Vincent Feuvrier showed in his thesis [9] a partial existence result, which says that given\nan original set E in B, there exists a certain set F that is minimal in B, which is the limit of a\nminimizing sequence of deformations of E in B, and such that\n(1.6)\n\nH 2 (F ) \u2264 inf{H 2 (E 0 ) : E 0 \u2282 B(0, 1) is a deformation of E in B(0, 1)}.\n\nWe cannot say that this set F obtained by limit of deformations is still a deformation of E, but\nluckily we shall not need to know that. We show first that for i = 1, 2, the projection of each set Ek\non the plane Pki contains Pki \u2229 B; then we manage to show that Ek has the same boundary as Pk . We\ncan also get\n(1.7)\n\nH 2 (Ek ) < 2\u03c0 = H 2 (Pk \u2229 B).\n\nHence we get our favorite sequence of minimal sets Ek , whose boundaries converge to the boundary\nP0 \u2229 \u2202B of P0 (recall that P0 = P01 \u222a\u22a5 P02 ). We take a convergent subsequence, that we still denote\nby {Ek }. By [4] Thm 4.1, the limit of a sequence of minimal sets is still minimal, hence the limit E\u221e\nof {Ek } is minimal. Now E\u221e \u2229 \u2202B = P0 \u2229 \u2202B, hence the uniqueness theorem for P0 tells us that E\u221e\ncannot be anyone other than P0 . Moreover, the Hausdorff distance between Ek and Pk also converges\nto 0, because Pk converges also to P0 . See Section 4 for detail.\nNow for every fixed small \u000f, we will use a stopping time argument to decompose every Ek . More\nprecisely, we use a stopping time argument to find, for each k, a critical radius rk = rk (\u000f), such that\nEk is \u000f-near Pk or a translation outside a ball B(ok , rk ), with ok fairly near the origin. Moreover in\nB(ok , rk ), Ek begins to get away a little from Pk , that is, rk is the scale in which Ek begins to go away\n5\n\n\ffrom Pk , even though we do not understand how. In spite of that, we will manage to show that the\nthe projections of the part of Ek inside B(ok , rk ) on the two planes are surjective. (The proof of this\nprojection property is essentially derived from the construction in the proof of the partial existence\nresult of [9], which is somehow complicated).\nWe know that rk is the very first radius such that Ek is not \u000frk near Pk , so when \u000f is sufficiently\nsmall, by the regularity of minimal sets near flat points, we manage to show that outside the small\nball B(ok , 14 rk ), Ek is the union of two C 1 graphs on Pk1 , Pk2 respectively. Then we decompose Ek into\ntwo parts, which are outside and inside B(ok , 14 rk ) respectively.\nFor the part outside, we already know that Ek is composed of two graphs Gi of C 1 functions\nfi from the annuli Pki \u2229 B(0, 1)\\B(ok , 41 rk ) to Pki\n\n\u22a5\n\nrespectively. But the union of two parts is not\n\n\u000frk -near any translation of Pk in B(ok , rk )\\B(ok , 14 rk ) (in fact, we have only shown that Ek is not \u000frk near any translation of Pk in B(ok , rk ) rather than B(ok , rk )\\B(ok , 41 rk ), but then we can prove by a\ncompactness argument that Ek is not too close to any translation of Pk in B(ok , rk )\\B(ok , 41 rk ) either,\nmaybe at the price of making \u000f smaller. See Section 8 for more detail). Thus, at least one of the two\ngraphs is 21 \u000frk far from any translation of its domain. Suppose this is the case for i = 1. This means\nthat f1 oscillates of order \u000frk in the region B(ok , rk )\\B(ok , 14 rk ). Then some argument using harmonic\nR\nfunctions gives that the Dirichlet energy P 1 \u2229B(0,1)\\B(ok , 1 rk ) |\u2207f1 |2 of f1 on Pk1 \u2229 B(0, 1)\\B(ok , 41 rk )\n4\n\nk\n\nis larger than C(\u000f)rk2 . But this is almost equivalent to the difference between the measure of the graph\nG1 and the measure of the annulus Pk1 \u2229 B(0, 1)\\B(ok , 41 rk ), so we have\n(1.8)\n\n1\n1\nH 2 (Ek \u2229 B(0, 1)\\B(ok rk )) \u2265 H 2 (Pk1 \u2229 B(0, 1)\\B(ok , rk )) + C(\u000f)rk2 .\n4\n4\n\nThis means we gain some measure C(\u000f)rk2 , where the constant C(\u000f) does not depend on k.\nFor the inside part, by a projection argument we can show that\n\n(1.9)\n\n1\n\u03c0\n1\nH 2 (Ek \u2229 B(ok , rk )) \u2265 (1 \u2212 C \u00d7 ( \u2212 \u03b8k ))H 2 (Pk \u2229 B(ok , rk ))\n4\n2\n4\n1\n\u03c0\n2\n= H (Pk \u2229 B(ok , rk )) \u2212 C \u00d7 ( \u2212 \u03b8k )rk2 ,\n4\n2\n\nwhere (recall that)\n\n\u03c0\n2\n\n\u2212 \u03b8k \u2192 0 as k \u2192 \u221e.\n\nAltogether we get\n(1.10)\n\nH 2 (Ek ) \u2265 H 2 (Pk \u2229 B(0, 1)) + [C(\u000f) \u2212 C \u00d7 (\n\n\u03c0\n\u2212 \u03b8k )]rk2 .\n2\n\nWhen k \u2192 \u221e, the term [C(\u000f) \u2212 C \u00d7 ( \u03c02 \u2212 \u03b8k )]rk2 is strictly positive, so the measure of Ek \u2229 B is strictly\nlarger than 2\u03c0. But this cannot happen, because of (1.7).\nThus we finish the proof of Theorem 1.2.\nHere we have to point out that if we could control how fast are the Ek converging to P0 , then we\nwould be able to give an estimate on the term C(\u000f) \u2212 C \u00d7 ( \u03c02 \u2212 \u03b8k ), and thus to give an estimate on\n6\n\n\fthe angle \u03b8 in Theorem 1.2. But such a control might need a deeper understanding of the uniqueness\ntheorem of P0 (Thm 3.1).\nThe same kind of argument for proving Theorem 1.2 can be generalized (but not trivially) to prove\nthe minimality of the union of n almost orthogonal planes of dimension m in Rmn (which are also\nrelated to Morgan's conjecture), and also the union of a plane and a Y in R5 . See [13] for detail.\nThe plan for the rest of this article is the following.\nSubsection 1.1 will give some notation and conventions that we will use frequently afterwards.\nSection 2 is devoted to the estimation of the sum of projections of a simple unit 2-vector to two\nplanes, estimation that depends on the characteristic angles of the two planes. Based on this we give\na comparison between the measure of a rectifiable set and the sum of the measures of its projections\non the two planes.\nIn Section 3 we prove that P0 is the only minimal set in B(0, 1) with the given boundary and\nsurjective projections.\nIn Section 4 we show the existence of the minimal sets Ek , as well as some of their properties.\nSection 5 is devoted to finding the critical radius rk , and giving some properties of Ek outside\nthe\"ball\" D(ok , 41 rk ).\nIn Section 6 we prove that the projections of Ek on Pk1 and Pk1 are surjective, in B(0, 1), as well\nas in B(ok , t) for all t \u2208 [ 14 rk , rk ]. We also give the C 1 regularity of Ek outside the ball B(ok , 41 rk ).\nSection 7 contains an argument of harmonic extension, which gives a lower bound for the measure\nof the graph of a function, depending on the size of the order of its oscillations near the boundary.\nFinally we arrive at our conclusion in Section 8, by combining all the information we gathered\nbefore.\nAcknowledgement: I would like to thank Guy David for many helpful discussions and for\nhis continual encouragement.

We are mostly interested in d = 2 and n = 4 here.\nDefinition 1.11 (Almgren competitor (Al competitor for short)). Let E be a closed set in an open\nsubset U of Rn . An Almgren competitor for E is a closed set F \u2282 U that can be written as F = \u03c61 (E),\nwhere \u03c6t : U \u2192 U is a family of continuous mappings such that\n(1.12)\n\n\u03c60 (x) = x for x \u2208 U ;\n\n(1.13)\n\nthe mapping (t, x) \u2192 \u03c6t (x) of [0, 1] \u00d7 U to U is continuous;\n\n(1.14)\n\n\u03c61 is Lipschitz,\n\nc=S\nand if we set Wt = {x \u2208 U ; \u03c6t (x) 6= x} and W\nt\u2208[0.1] [Wt \u222a \u03c6t (Wt )], then\n(1.15)\n\nc is relatively compact in U.\nW\n\nSuch a \u03c61 is called a deformation in U , and F is also called a deformation of E in U .\nDefinition 1.16 ((Almgren) minimal sets). Let 0 < d < n be integers, U an open set of Rn . A closed\nset E in U is said to be minimal of dimension d in U if\n(1.17)\n\nH d (E \u2229 B) < \u221e for every compact ball B \u2282 U,\n\nand\nH d (E\\F ) \u2264 H d (F \\E)\n\n(1.18)\nfor all Al competitors F for E.\n\nRemark 1.19. When the ambient set U is Rn , or a ball, we can also take the class of local Almgren\ncompetitors to define the same notion of minimal set. Keep the E, U , n and d as before; a local\nAlmgren competitor of E in U is a set F = f (E), with\n(1.20)\n\nf = id outside some compact ball B \u2282 U,\n\n(1.21)\n\nf (B) \u2282 B,\n\nand f is Lipschitz.\n8\n\n\fA such f is called a local deformation in U , or a deformation in B, and F = f (E) is also called\na local deformation of E in U , or a deformation of E in B.\nNote that in this case, the condition (1.18) becomes\nH d (E \u2229 B) \u2264 H d (F \u2229 B).\n\n(1.22)\n\nWe say that a set E closed in an open set U is locally minimal if (1.17) holds, and for any compact\nball B \u2282 U , and any local Almgren competitor F for E in B, (1.22) holds.\nOne can easily verify that when U is Rn or a ball, the class of Al competitors coincides with the\nclass of local Al competitors, so the two classes define the same kind of minimal sets. However, if\nthe ambient set U has a more complicated geometry, then the class of local Al competitors is strictly\nsmaller, so a set minimizing the Hausdorff measure among local Al competitors might fail to be Alminimal.\nRemark 1.23. The notion of minimal sets does not depend much on the ambient dimension. One\ncan easily check that E \u2282 U is d\u2212dimensional minimal in U \u2282 Rn if and only if E is minimal in\nU \u00d7 Rm \u2282 Rm+n , for any integer m.\nRemark 1.24. For a description of a little more general kind of sets, such as soap bubbles (where the\npressures are different in different connected components of their complementary), or taking gravity\ninto consideration, we can use a notion of almost minimal sets, where we add some error term in the\ncondition (1.18). To these sets, almost all the argument for minimal sets can be applied, and we have\nessentially the same regularity results. See [5] for definitions and more detail.\nDefinition 1.25 (reduced set). Let U \u2282 Rn be an open set. For every closed subset E of U , denote\nby\n(1.26)\n\nE \u2217 = {x \u2208 E ; H d (E \u2229 B(x, r)) > 0 for all r > 0}\n\nthe closed support (in U ) of the restriction of H d to E. We say that E is reduced if E = E \u2217 .\nIt is easy to see that\n(1.27)\n\nH d (E\\E \u2217 ) = 0.\n\nIn fact we can cover E\\E \u2217 by countably many balls Bj such that H d (E \u2229 Bj ) = 0.\nRemark 1.28. If E is minimal, then E \u2217 is also minimal, because if \u03c61 is a deformation in U\nas defined in Definition 1.11, then it is Lipschitz, hence H d (\u03c6(E\\E \u2217 )) = H d (E\\E \u2217 ) = 0. So the\ncondition (1.18) is the same for E \u2217 as for E. As a result it is enough to study reduced minimal sets.\n\n9\n\n\fDefinition 1.29 (blow-up limit). Let U \u2282 Rn be an open set, let E be a relatively closed set in U ,\nand let x \u2208 E. Denote by E(r, x) = r\u22121 (E \u2212 x). A set C is said to be a blow-up limit of E at x if\nthere exists a sequence of numbers rn , with limn\u2192\u221e rn = 0, such that the sequence of sets E(rn , x)\nconverges to C for the Hausdorff distance in any compact set of Rn .\nRemark 1.30. A set E might have more than one blow-up limit at a point x.\nWe now state some regularity results that will be used throughout this paper.\nDefinition 1.31 (bi-H\u00f6lder ball for closed sets). Let E be a closed set of Hausdorff dimension 2 in Rn .\nWe say that B(0, 1) is a bi-H\u00f6lder ball for E, with constant \u03c4 \u2208 (0, 1), if we can find a 2-dimensional\nminimal cone Z in Rn centered at 0, and f : B(0, 2) \u2192 Rn with the following properties:\n1\u25e6 f (0) = 0 and |f (x) \u2212 x| \u2264 \u03c4 for x \u2208 B(0, 2);\n2\u25e6 (1 \u2212 \u03c4 )|x \u2212 y|1+\u03c4 \u2264 |f (x) \u2212 f (y)| \u2264 (1 + \u03c4 )|x \u2212 y|1\u2212\u03c4 for x, y \u2208 B(0, 2);\n3\u25e6 B(0, 2 \u2212 \u03c4 ) \u2282 f (B(0, 2));\n4\u25e6 E \u2229 B(0, 2 \u2212 \u03c4 ) \u2282 f (Z \u2229 B(0, 2)) \u2282 E.\nWe also say that B(0,1) is of type Z.\nWe say that B(x, r) is a bi-H\u00f6lder ball for E of type Z (with the same parameters) when B(0, 1)\nis a bi-H\u00f6lder ball of type Z for r\u22121 (E \u2212 x).\nTheorem 1.32 (Bi-H\u00f6lder regularity for 2-dimensional minimal sets, c.f.[5] Thm 16.1). Let U be an\nopen set in Rn and E a reduced minimal set in U . Then for each x0 \u2208 E and every choice of \u03c4 \u2208 (0, 1),\nthere is an r0 > 0 and a minimal cone Z such that B(x0 , r0 ) is a bi-H\u00f6lder ball of type Z for E, with\nconstant \u03c4 . Moreover, Z is a blow-up limit of E at x.\nDefinition 1.33 (point of type Z). In the above theorem, we say that x0 is a point of type Z (or Z\npoint for short) of the minimal set E.\nRemark 1.34. Again, since we might have more than one blow-up limit for a minimal set E at a\npoint x0 \u2208 E, the point x0 might of more than one type (but all blow-up limits at a point are bi-H\u00f6lder\nequivalent). However, if one of the blow-up limits of E at x0 admits the \"full-length\" property (see\nRemark 1.36), then in fact E admits a unique blow-up limit at the point x0 . Moreover, we have the\nfollowing C 1,\u03b1 regularity around the point x0 . In particular, the blow-up limit of E at x0 is in fact a\ntangent cone of E at x0 .\nTheorem 1.35 (C 1,\u03b1 \u2212regularity for 2-dimensional minimal sets, c.f. [6] Thm 1.15). Let E be a 2dimensional reduced minimal set in the open set U \u2282 Rn . Let x \u2208 E be given. Suppose in addition that\nsome blow-up limit of E at x is a full length minimal cone (see Remark 1.36). Then there is a unique\nblow-up limit X of E at x, and x + X is tangent to E at x. In addition, there is a radius r0 > 0 such\n10\n\n\fthat, for 0 < r < r0 , there is a C 1,\u03b1 diffeomorphism (for some \u03b1 > 0) \u03a6 : B(0, 2r) \u2192 \u03a6(B(0, 2r)),\nsuch that \u03a6(0) = x and |\u03a6(y) \u2212 x \u2212 y| \u2264 10\u22122 r for y \u2208 B(0, 2r), and E \u2229 B(x, r) = \u03a6(X) \u2229 B(x, r).\nWe can also ask that D\u03a6(x) = Id. We call B(x, r) a C 1 ball for E of type X.\nRemark 1.36 (full length, union of two full length cones X1 \u222a X2 ). We are not going to give the\nprecise definition of the full length property. Instead, we just give some information here, which is\nenough for the proofs in this paper.\n1) The three types of 2-dimensional minimal cones in R3 , i.e. the planes, the Y sets, and the T sets,\nall verify the full-length property (c.f., [6] Lemmas 14.4, 14.6 and 14.27). Hence all 2-dimensional\nminimal sets E in an open set U \u2282 R3 admits the local C 1,\u03b1 regularity at every point x \u2208 E. But this\nwas known from [20].\n2) (c.f., [6] Remark 14.40) Let n > 3. Note that the planes, the Y sets and the T sets are also\nminimal cones in Rn . Denote by C the set of all planes, Y sets and T sets in Rn . Let X = \u222a1\u2264i\u2264n Xi \u2208\nRn be a minimal cone, where Xi \u2208 C, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, and for any i 6= j, Xi \u2229 Xj = {0}. Then X also\nverifies the full-length property.\n\n2\n\nProjections on two orthogonal or almost orthogonal planes\n\nIn this section, we will give some estimates for the sum of the measures of projections of a rectifiable\nset on two transversal planes. These estimates are somewhat algebraic, and mainly use estimates for\nthe sum of projections of simple unit 2-vectors in R4 . Here unit simple 2-vectors are used to represent\nplanes and their relative positions, or are treated as surface elements or derivatives of functions between\ntwo rectifiable sets when we try to do some integration. As a result the orientation of a simple 2-vector\nwill be ignored, in other words, we will essentially not need to distinguish between x \u2227 y and y \u2227 x.\nDenote by \u22272 (R4 ) the space of all 2-vectors in R4 . Let x, y be two vectors in R4 , we denote by\nx \u2227 y \u2208 \u22272 (R4 ) their exterior product. If {ei }1\u2264i\u22644 is an orthonormal basis, then {ei \u2227 ej }1\u2264i<j\u22644\nforms a basis of \u22272 (R4 ). We say that an element v \u2208 \u22272 (R4 ) is simple if it can be expressed as the\nexterior product of two vectors.\nThe norm on \u22272 (R4 ), denoted by | * |, is defined by\n(2.1)\n\n|\n\nX\n\n\u03bbij ei \u2227 ej | =\n\ni<j\n\nX\n\n|\u03bbij |2 .\n\ni<j\n\nUnder this norm \u22272 (R4 ), is a Hilbert space, and {ei \u2227ej }1\u2264i<j\u22644 is an orthonormal basis. For a simple\n2-vector x \u2227 y, its norm is\n(2.2)\n\n|x \u2227 y| = ||x||||y|| sin \u2220x,y ,\n11\n\n\fwhere \u2220x,y \u2208 [0, \u03c0] is the angle between the vectors x and y, and || * || denotes the Euclidean norm on\nR4 . A unit simple 2-vector is a simple 2-vector of norm 1. Notice that | * | is generated by the scalar\nP\nP\nproduct <, > defined on \u22272 (R4 ) as follows: for \u03be = 1\u2264i<j\u22644 aij ei \u2227 ej , \u03b6 = 1\u2264i<j\u22644 bij ei \u2227 ej ,\n(2.3)\n\n< \u03be, \u03b6 >=\n\nX\n\naij bij .\n\n1\u2264i<j\u22644\n\nOne can easily verify that if two pairs of vectors x, y and x0 , y 0 generate the same 2-dimensional\nsubspace of R4 , then there exists r \u2208 R\\{0} such that x \u2227 y = rx0 \u2227 y 0 .\nNow given a unit simple 2-vector \u03be, we can associate it to a 2-dimensional subspace P (\u03be) \u2208 G(4, 2),\nwhere G(4, 2) denotes the set of all 2-dimensional subspaces of R4 :\nP (\u03be) = {v \u2208 R4 , v \u2227 \u03be = 0}.\n\n(2.4)\n\nIn other words, P (x \u2227 y) is the subspace generated by x and y.\nFrom time to time, when there is no ambiguity, we write also P = x \u2227 y, where P \u2208 G(4, 2) and\nthe two unit vectors x, y \u2208 R4 are such that P = P (x \u2227 y). In this case x \u2227 y represents a plane.\nFor the side of linear maps, if f is a linear map from R4 to R4 , then we denote by \u22272 f (and\nsometimes f if there is no ambiguity) the linear map from \u22272 (R4 ) to \u22272 (R4 ) such that\n\u22272 f (x \u2227 y) = f (x) \u2227 f (y).\n\n(2.5)\n\nAnd for the side of G(4, 2) (the set of all planes, without considering orientations), for a unit simple\n2-vector \u03be \u2208 \u22272 R4 , we have always P (\u03be) = P (\u2212\u03be), so that we can define |f (*)| : G(4, 2) \u2192 R+ \u222a {0}\nby\n|f (P (\u03be))| = | \u22272 f (\u03be)|.\n\n(2.6)\n\nOne can easily verify that the value of |f (P (\u03be))| does not depend on the choice of \u03be that generates P .\nSo |f (*)| is well defined.\n\n2.1\n\nSome estimate for the sum of projections of simple 2-vectors on two\ntransversal planes\n\nLet us recall the definition of characteristic angles between two planes. Let P 1 , P 2 be two 2-dimensional\nplanes in R4 . Among all pairs of unit vectors (v, w) with v \u2208 P 1 , w \u2208 P 2 , we choose (v1 , w1 ) which\nminimizes the angle between them. We denote by \u03b11 this angle. Next we look at all the pairs of unit\nvectors {(v 0 , w0 ) : v 0 \u2208 P 1 , w0 \u2208 P 2 , v 0 \u22a5 v1 , w0 \u22a5 w1 } (here P 1 and P 2 are 2-dimensional, so once\nw1 , v1 are fixed, generally we only have four such pairs, (\u00b1v2 , \u00b1w2 )), and we choose (v2 , w2 ) which\nminimize the angle among all such pairs. Denote by \u03b12 this angle. Then (\u03b11 , \u03b12 ) (with \u03b11 \u2264 \u03b12 ) is\nthe pair of characteristic angles between P 1 and P 2 .\n12\n\n\fCharacteristic angles characterize absolutely the relative position between two planes, in the sense\nthat we can find an orthonormal basis {ei }1\u2264i\u22644 of R4 , such that\n(2.7)\n\nP 1 = e1 \u2227 e2 and P 2 = (cos \u03b11 e1 + sin \u03b11 e3 ) \u2227 (cos \u03b12 e2 + sin \u03b12 e4 ).\n\nNotice that two planes are orthogonal if their pair of characteristic angles is ( \u03c02 , \u03c02 ).\nNow we want to estimate the sum of projections of a unit simple 2-vector on them. Denote by pi\nthe orthogonal projection on P i , i = 1, 2. Then pi is a linear map. We also denote by pi the linear\nmap \u22272 pi from \u22272 (R4 ) to itself, as defined in (2.5).\nNow let \u03be be a unit simple 2-vector, then there exists two unit vectors x, y such that \u03be = x \u2227 y and\nx \u22a5 y. We write x, y in the basis :\nx = ae1 + be2 + ce3 + de4 , y = a0 e1 + b0 e2 + c0 e3 + d0 e4\n\n(2.8)\nwith\n\na2 + b2 + c2 + d2 = a02 + b02 + c02 + d02 = 1\n\n(2.9)\nand\n\naa0 + bb0 + cc0 + dd0 = 0.\n\n(2.10)\n\nWe calculate the projections |pj (\u03be)|.\n|p1 (\u03be)| = | < e1 \u2227 e2 , \u03be > | = |ab0 \u2212 a0 b|,\n\n(2.11)\nand\n\n|p2 (\u03be)| = | < (cos \u03b11 e1 + sin \u03b11 e3 ) \u2227 (cos \u03b12 e2 + sin \u03b12 e4 ), \u03be > |\n= |(ab0 \u2212 a0 b) cos \u03b11 cos \u03b12 + (ad0 \u2212 a0 d) cos \u03b11 sin \u03b12\n\n(2.12)\n\n+ (cb0 \u2212 c0 b) sin \u03b11 cos \u03b12 + (cd0 \u2212 c0 d) sin \u03b11 sin \u03b12 |.\nThen when \u03b11 = \u03b12 =\n\n\u03c0\n2,\n\nwe have\n\n|p1 (\u03be)| + |p2 (\u03be)| = |ab0 \u2212 a0 b| + |cd0 \u2212 c0 d| \u2264 |ab0 | + |a0 b| + |cd0 | + |c0 d|\n(2.13)\n\u2264\n\n1 2\n1\n(a + b02 + a02 + b2 ) + (c2 + d02 + c02 + d2 ) = 1\n2\n2\n\nbecause of (2.9). So we get the following lemma.\nLemma 2.14. Let P 1 , P 2 be two orthogonal planes, then for every unit simple 2-vector \u03be \u2208 \u22272 R4 we\nhave\n(2.15)\n\n|p1 (\u03be)| + |p2 (\u03be)| \u2264 1.\n13\n\n\fMore precisely, the next lemma gives exactly which are those unit simple 2-vectors satisfying\nV\nequality in (2.15).

More precisely, we will prove the\nfollowing Theorem 3.1. It looks quite natural, but its proof is more complicated than the author\nimagined.\nTheorem 3.1. [uniqueness of P0 ] Let P0 = P01 \u222a\u22a5 P02 , as in the previous section, and denote by pi0\nthe orthogonal projection on P0i , i = 1, 2. Let E \u2282 B(0, 1) be a 2-dimensional closed reduced set such\nthat E \u2229 B(0, 1) is minimal in B(0, 1) \u2282 R4 , and\n(3.2)\n\npi0 (E \u2229 B(0, 1)) \u2283 P0i \u2229 B(0, 1);\n\n(3.3)\n\nE \u2229 \u2202B(0, 1) = P0 \u2229 \u2202B(0, 1);\nH 2 (E \u2229 B(0, 1)) \u2264 2\u03c0\n\n(3.4)\n\n(or equivalently H 2 (E \u2229 B(0, 1)) = 2\u03c0, see near (3.5)).\n\nThen E = P0 \u2229 B(0, 1).\nIn the rest of the section, we suppose that E is a set that verifies all the hypotheses in Theorem\n3.1.\nFirst notice that pi0 (E) = P0i \u2229 B(0, 1), because E \u2282 B(0, 1) and pi0 (E) \u2283 P0i \u2229 B(0, 1). As a result\n(3.5)\n\nH 2 (E) = H 2 (E \u2229 B(0, 1)) = 2\u03c0\n= H 2 (P01 \u2229 B(0, 1)) + H 2 (P02 \u2229 B(0, 1)) = H 2 (p10 (E)) + H 2 (p20 (E)).\n\nCompare with (2.36), and observe that here by Lemma 2.14 we can take \u03bb = 1, we have that all the\ninequalities in (2.36), and hence also in (2.32), are in fact equalities. This means that\n(3.6)\n\nfor almost all point x \u2208 E, |p10 (Tx E)| + |p20 (Tx E)| = 1, or equivalently Tx E \u2208 P (\u039e),\n\nand\n(3.7)\n\nfor i = 1, 2, for almost all z \u2208 pi0 (E), N (pi0 , z) = ]{pi0\n\n\u22121\n\n(z) \u2229 E} = 1.\n\nNow we are going to use these two conditions and Lemma 2.17 to get useful local properties of the\nset E.\nFirst of all, since E \u2229 B(0, 1) is a reduced minimal set in B(0, 1), we know that for all x \u2208 E, there\nexists a bi-H\u00f6lder ball B(x, r) \u2282 B(0, 1), and in B(x, r) the set E is bi-H\u00f6lder equivalent to a minimal\ncone Cx (c.f. Theorem 1.32). The cone Cx is a blow-up limit of E at x.\nOn the other hand, all that we know generally for a 2-dimensional minimal cone C is that its\nintersection with the unit sphere S = C \u2229 \u2202B(0, 1) is a finite collection of great circles and arcs of\n18\n\n\fgreat circles. Every great circle is disjoint from the rest of S; at their ends, the arcs meet by set of\nthree, with 120\u25e6 angles, and in particular no free ends exists (c.f.[5], Proposition 14.1). Hence each\nendpoint of any of these arcs is a one-dimensional Y point of the net S. Thus if a minimal cone is\nnot the union of several transversal planes, its intersection with the unit sphere contains at least a Y\npoint. As a result, there exist Y points in C arbitrarily near the origin, since C is a cone.\nThis discussion yields the following.\nLemma 3.8. There is no point of type Y in E \u2229 B(0, 1).\nProof. If x \u2208 E is a point of type Y, then it means that the (unique, by Theorem 1.35 and Remark\n1.36) tangent cone Cx is composed of 3 closed half planes {Pi }1\u2264i\u22643 which meet along a line D passing\nthrough the origin. Denote by Qi , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 3 the plane that contains Pi . In this case we claim that\n(3.9)\n\nat least one Qi doesn't belong to P (\u039e).\n\nIn fact, if we denote by v the unit vector generating D, then there exist three unit vectors wi , 1 \u2264\ni \u2264 3 such that wi \u22a5 v, Qi = P (v \u2227 wi ), and the angle between any two of the wi is 120\u25e6 .\nIf Q1 6\u2208 P (\u039e), then the claim (3.9) holds automatically. Suppose that Q1 \u2208 P (\u039e), and hence\nv \u2227 w1 \u2208 \u039e. Then by Lemma 2.17, there exist unit vectors vj , uj , j = 1, 2 with vj \u2208 P01 , uj \u2208 P02 ,\nv1 \u22a5 v2 , u1 \u22a5 u2 , and \u03b1 \u2208 [0, \u03c02 ], such that\n(3.10)\n\nv = cos \u03b1 v1 + sin \u03b1 u1 , w1 = cos \u03b1 v2 + sin \u03b1 u2 .\n\nBut then since uj , vj , j = 1, 2 generate R4 , there exists a, b, c, d \u2208 R with a2 + b2 + c2 + d2 = 1 such\nthat w2 = av1 + bv2 + cu1 + du2 . Therefore\n|p10 (Q2 )| + |p20 (Q2 )| = | \u22272 p10 (v \u2227 w2 )| + | \u22272 p20 (v \u2227 w2 )|\n1\n\n1\n\n= |b cos \u03b1| + |d sin \u03b1| \u2264 (b2 + d2 ) 2 (cos2 \u03b1 + sin2 \u03b1) 2\n\n(3.11)\n\n1\n\n= (b2 + d2 ) 2 \u2264 1.\nSo if we want Q2 belong to P (\u039e), all inequalities in (3.11) should be equalities, therefore b2 +d2 = 1,\nand b : d = \u00b1 cos \u03b1 : sin \u03b1. As a result, (b, d) = (\u00b1 cos \u03b1, \u00b1 sin \u03b1), a2 + c2 = 0, and hence w2 = \u00b1w1\nor \u00b1(cos \u03b1v2 \u2212 sin \u03b1u2 ).\nNotice that angle between w1 and w2 is 120\u25e6 , so there are only two possibilities for \u03b1, which are\n\u03c0\n3\n\nand\n\n\u03c0\n6.\n\nIf \u03b1 =\n\n\u03c0\n3,\n\nthen w1 = 12 v2 +\n\n\u221a\n\n3\n2 u2\n\nand w2 = 12 v2 \u2212\n\n\u221a\n\n3\n2 u2 .\n\nBut the argument above holds also for\n\nw3 , so we have w3 = w2 , which contradicts the fact that the angle between w2 and w3 is 120\u25e6 .\nThe situation is the same for \u03b1 =\n\n\u03c0\n6.\n\nThus we have proved the claim (3.9).\n\n19\n\n\fNow suppose for example that Q1 6\u2208 P (\u039e). Then since P (\u039e) is closed in G(4, 2), there exists an\nopen set U \u2282 G(4, 2) that contains Q1 such that U \u2229 P (\u039e) = \u2205.\nAs we said, Y is a cone with the full-length property. Hence by the theorem of C 1+\u03b1 -regularity\nfor minimal sets (c.f. Theorem 1.35), there exists r > 0 such that B(x, r) \u2282 B(0, 1), and in B(x, r), E\ncoincides with the image of Cx +x of a C 1 homeomorphism \u03c6 from R4 to R4 (recall that Cx = \u222a3i=1 Pi ).\nDenote by R = \u03c6(Q1 ). Then the map T : R \u2192 G(4, 2), T (x) = Tx R is continuous. As a result T \u22121 (U )\nis open. Denote R+ = \u03c6(P1 ). Then T \u22121 (U ) \u2229 \u03c6\u22121 (R+ ) 6= \u2205, since it contains x. Therefore T \u22121 (U )\nis relatively open in R+ . But R+ is a C 1 manifold with boundary, whose boundary \u03c6(D) is of zero\nmeasure, so R+ \u2229 T \u22121 (U )\\\u03c6(D) is of positive measure. Now for every y \u2208 R+ \u2229 T \u22121 (U )\\\u03c6(D),\nTy R = Ty E 6\u2208 P (\u039e), thus we have found a set of positive measure and all of its point do not satisfy\n2\n\n(3.6); this gives a contradiction.\n\nAfter this lemma, we will obtain some useful description of the local structure around each point\nx of E.\nLemma 3.12. For each x \u2208 E \u2229 B(0, 1), every blow-up limit of E at x is either a plane belonging to\nP (\u039e), or P0 .\nProof. Suppose that X is a blow-up limit of E at x, suppose also that x = 0 for short. First we claim\nthat\n(3.13)\n\nX doesn't contain any point of type Y.\n\nSuppose this is not true, then there exists p \u2208 X such that p is of type Y. Then p is not the origin,\nbecause otherwise X is of type Y, and hence 0 is of type Y, which gives a contradiction with Lemma\n3.8.\nSo p is not the origin. Then since X is a cone, for every r > 0, rp \u2208 X is a point of type Y. We can\nthus suppose that ||p|| = 1. Then by our description of 2-dimensional minimal cones (above Lemma\n3.8), there exists 0 < r <\nDefine dx,r (E, F ) =\n\n1\nr\n\n1\n2\n\nsuch that in B(p, r), X coincides with a cone Y of type Y centered at p.\n\nmax{sup{d(y, F ) : y \u2208 E \u2229 B(x, r)}, sup{d(y, E) : y \u2208 F \u2229 B(x, r)}}, which\n\nis the relative distance of two sets E, F with respect to the ball B(x, r). Now X is a blow-up limit\nof E at 0, so that there exists s > 0 (large) such that d0,2 (X, sE) <\nProposition 16.24 of [5]. Equivalently, dp, r2 (sE, X) <\n\nr\u000f2\n100 ,\n\nwhere \u000f2 is the constant in\n\n\u000f2\n50 .\n\nWe want to show that\n(3.14)\n\ndp, r2 (sE, X) = dp, r2 (sE, Y ).\n\n\u000f2\nOnce we have this, we take a point z \u2208 sE such that d(z, p) < 2r \u00d7 50\n, then dz, r4 (sE, Y +z \u2212p) <\n\n\u000f2\n10 .\n\nHere Y + z \u2212 p is a Y cone centered at z. But sE is minimal (since E is), therefore Proposition 16.24\n20\n\n\fof [5] gives that sE contains a Y point, and hence E, too. This contradicts Lemma 3.8. Thus we\nobtain our claim (3.13).\nWe should still prove (3.14). By definition,\n(3.15)\n\ndp, r2 (sE, X) =\n\n2\nmax{\nsup\nd(x, X),\nsup\nd(x, sE)}.\nr\nx\u2208sE\u2229B(p, r2 )\nx\u2208X\u2229B(p, r2 )\n\nFor the second term, we have X \u2229 B(p, 2r ) = Y \u2229 B(p, 2r ), and hence\n(3.16)\n\nsup\n\nd(x, sE) =\n\nx\u2208X\u2229B(p, r2 )\n\nsup\n\nd(x, sE).\n\nx\u2208Y \u2229B(p, r2 )\n\nFor the first term, we have\nr\nd(x, X) = d(x, X \u2229 B(p, r)) for all x \u2208 sE \u2229 B(p, ).\n2\n\n(3.17)\n\nIn fact, since dp, r2 (sE, X) <\n\n\u000f2\n50 ,\n\nfor each x \u2208 sE \u2229 B(p, 2r ), d(x, X) <\n\n\u000f2\n50\n\n\u00d7 2r , so d(x, X) = d(x, X \u2229\n\n\u000f2\n\u000f2\nB(x, 50\n\u00d7 2r )) \u2264 d(x, X \u2229B(p, r)), because B(x, 50\n\u00d7 2r ) \u2282 B(p, r). On the other hand, X \u2229B(p, r) \u2282 X,\n\ntherefore d(x, X) \u2265 d(x, X \u2229 B(p, r)). Thus we have (3.17), and hence\nsup\n(3.18)\n\nd(x, X) =\n\nsup\n\nd(x, X \u2229 B(p, r))\n\nx\u2208sE\u2229B(p, r2 )\n\nx\u2208sE\u2229B(p, r2 )\n\n=\n\nsup\n\nd(x, Y \u2229 B(p, r)) \u2265\n\nx\u2208sE\u2229B(p, r2 )\n\nsup\n\nd(x, Y ).\n\nx\u2208sE\u2229B(p, r2 )\n\nCombining with (3.16) we have\n(3.19)\n\ndp, r2 (sE, X) \u2264 dp, r2 (sE, Y ).\n\nA similar argument yields\n(3.20)\n\ndp, r2 (sE, Y ) \u2264 dp, r2 (sE, X).\n\nSo we have (3.14), and (3.13) follows.\nSince X is a minimal cone, as we have said before, X \u2229 \u2202B(0, 1) is a finite collection of great circles\nand arcs of great circles that meet by 3 with angles of 120\u25e6 . Then (3.13) implies that there is no such\narcs, since X does not have Y points. As a result, X \u2229 \u2202B(0, 1) is a finite collection of great circles,\nand therefore X is the union of a finite number of transversal planes.\nBy Remark 1.36, X is a full-length cone, so the C 1 regularity holds (Thm 1.35). Then by the same\nargument as for Y in the proof of Lemma 3.8, every plane in X belongs to P (\u039e), since P (\u039e) is closed.\nAs a result, if X is not a plane, then X = \u222ani=1 Qn with Qn \u2208 \u039e with n \u2265 2. These Qn are\ntransversal, by Lemma 2.17. Moreover in a small neighborhood B(x, r) of the point x, the set E is a\nunion of n transversal C 1 manifolds Si , 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, and the tangent plane to Si at x is Qn .\n\n21\n\n\fBy Lemma 2.17, for all Q \u2208 \u039e and Q 6= P02 , there exists s = sQ > 0 such that p10 (Q \u2229 B(0, 1)) \u2283\nP01 \u2229 B(0, sQ ). Hence if X contains two planes Qi , Qj , i 6= j, that are different from P02 , there exists\ns > 0 such that p10 (Q1 \u2229 B(0, 1)) \u2229 p10 (Q2 \u2229 B(0, 1)) \u2283 B(0, s) \u2229 P01 . Then since the tangent plane to\nSi at x is Qi and that to Sj at x is Qj , there exists a neighborhood U of p10 (x) which is contained in\nboth projections p10 (Si ) and p10 (Sj ). Notice that Si and Sj are transverse, hence Si \u2229 Sj = {x}. This\nyields that each point y \u2208 U \\p10 (x) admits at least two pre-images by p10 in E \u2229 B(x, r), one is in Si\nand the other is in Sj , i.e.,\n(3.21)\n\n(U \\{p10 (x)}) \u2229 P01 \u2282 {z \u2208 P01 , ]{p10\n\n\u22121\n\n{z} \u2229 E} \u2265 2}.\n\nBut U is open, so (U \\{p10 (x)}) \u2229 P01 is of positive measure, which contradicts (3.7).\nHence in X, we have at most one plane different from P02 . The same argument gives also that we\nhave at most one plane which is not P01 . But X contains at least two planes, therefore X = P01 \u222a P02 =\n2\n\nP0 .\n\nLemma 3.12 says that there exists only two types of blow-up limits in E, and both of them have\nthe full-length property. As a result, by Thm 1.35, around each point x \u2208 E, E is locally C 1 equivalent\nto a plane or to P0 .\nThe two next lemmas will describe more precisely what happens around each of the two types of\nsingularities. We identify R4 with C \u00d7 C.\nLemma 3.22. Let {e1 , e2 = ie1 , e3 , e4 = ie3 } be an orthonormal basis of R4 , with P01 = e1 \u2227 e2 and\nP02 = e3 \u2227 e4 . Let x \u2208 E \u2229 B(0, 1) be a point of type P such that Tx E 6= P02 . Then there exists\nr = r(x) > 0 such that in B(x, r), E is (under the given basis) the graph of a complex analytic or\nanti-analytic function \u03c6 = \u03c6x : P01 \u2192 P02 . More precisely,\n(3.23)\n\nE \u2229 B(x, r) = graph(\u03c6) \u2229 B(x, r).\n\nWe have also a similar conclusion for x such that Tx E 6= P01 , i.e., near x, E is the graph of a complex\nanalytic or anti-analytic function from P02 to P01 .\nProof. We will only prove it for Tx E 6= P02 . The other case is similar.\nSo let x \u2208 E be as in the lemma. Assume all the hypotheses in the lemma. Since x is a P\npoint, there exists r1 > 0 such that in B(x, r1 ), E is the graph of a C 1 function \u03c61 : Tx E \u2192 Tx E \u22a5\n(c.f. Thm 1.35). If we denote by \u03c0 the projection from R4 to Tx E, and define F : R4 \u2192 R2 by\nF (y) = y \u2212 \u03c61 (\u03c0(y)) \u2208 Tx E \u22a5 \u223c\n= R2 for y \u2208 B(x, r1 ), then F is C 1 regular, and E \u2229 B(x, r1 ) = {y \u2208\nB(x, r1 ) : F (y) = (0, 0)}. As a result, DF (x) is a linear map from R4 to R2 , with Tx E = KerDF (x).\nBy the hypothesis, Tx E 6= P02 , hence by Lemmas 3.12 and 2.17, Tx E can be represented by\nTx E = P ((cos \u03b1v1 + sin \u03b1u1 ) \u2227 (cos \u03b1v2 + sin \u03b1u2 )), with \u03b1 \u2208 [0, \u03c02 ), vi , ui , i = 1, 2 unit vectors,\n22\n\n\fvi \u2208 P01 , ui \u2208 P02 and v1 \u22a5 v2 , u1 \u22a5 u2 . In particular, P02 \u2229 KerDF (x) = P02 \u2229 Tx E = {0}. This means\nthat DF (x)|P02 is invertible. Then by the implicit function theorem, there exists r2 > 0 and a C 1 map\n\u03c6 : P01 \u2192 P02 , such that for every y = (y1 , y2 ) \u2208 P01 \u00d7 P02 \u2229 B(x, r2 ), F (y) = 0 \u21d4 y2 = \u03c6(y1 ). As a\nresult, in B(x, r2 ), E is the graph of \u03c6 : P01 \u2192 P02 .\nWe still have to prove that \u03c6 is complex analytic or anti-analytic. This will follow from a particular\nproperty of P (\u039e).\nMore precisely, return to the orthonormal basis {e1 , e2 = ie1 , e3 , e4 = ie3 } with P01 = e1 \u2227 e2 and\nP02 = e3 \u2227 e4 . Use Lemma 2.17, and expand each unit vector under the basis; a simple calculation\ngives\n(3.24)\n\n\u039e = {\u00b1[ae1 + be2 + ce3 + de4 ] \u2227 [\u2212be1 + ae2 \u00b1 (\u2212de3 + ce4 )],\na, b, c, d \u2208 R, a2 + b2 + c2 + d2 = 1},\n\nand hence\n(3.25)\n\nP (\u039e) = {P ([ae1 + be2 + ce3 + de4 ] \u2227 [\u2212be1 + ae2 \u00b1 (\u2212de3 + ce4 )]),\na, b, c, d \u2208 R, a2 + b2 + c2 + d2 = 1}.\n\nIf Ty E = [ae1 + be2 + ce3 + de4 ] \u2227 [\u2212be1 + ae2 + (\u2212de3 + ce4 )], this means that d\u03c6(y)(a + bi) =\nc + di, d\u03c6(y)(\u2212b + ai) = \u2212d + ci. But d\u03c6(y) is (real) linear, and a2 + b2 6= 0, therefore a + bi, \u2212b + ai\nis a basis, and d\u03c6(y) is determined by its values at these two points. Notice that\n\nc+di\na+bi\n\n=\n\n\u2212d+ci\n\u2212b+ai ,\n\nand\n\ndenote it by A \u2208 C, then we have d\u03c6(y)(z) = Az, which is complex analytic. In other words,\n(3.26)\n\nd\u03c6\n(y) = 0.\ndz\u0304\n\nIf Ty E = [ae1 +be2 +ce3 +de4 ]\u2227[\u2212be1 +ae2 \u2212(\u2212de3 +ce4 )], a similar argument gives d\u03c6(y)(z) = B z\u0304,\nand hence\n(3.27)\n\nd\u03c6\n(y) = 0.\ndz\n\nSo we have proved that \u03c6 is a complex C 1 function such that at each point, it is either analytic,\nor anti-analytic.\n1\nDenote by B = B(p1 (x), r) \u2229 P01 , B1 = {y \u2208 B, d\u03c6\ndz (y) 6= 0}. Then B1 is open, since \u03c6 is C . If\n\nB1 = \u2205, then \u03c6 is anti-analytic. Otherwise, B1 is not empty, and set g =\nB, and B1 = {y \u2208 B : g(y) 6= 0}. Moreover, since\n\nd\u03c6\ndz (y)\n\n6= 0 on B1 ,\n\n\u2202\u03c6\n\u2202z .\n\nd\u03c6\ndz\u0304 (y)\n\nThen g is continuous on\n\n= 0 on B1 (since at each\n\npoint \u03c6 is either analytic or anti-analytic), and hence \u03c6 is holomorphic on the open set B1 , so that\nits derivative g is holomorphic, too. Then conclusion of Lemma 3.22 will follow from the following\ntheorem (c.f.[19] Thm 12.14) :\nTheorem 3.28 (Rad\u00f3's theorem). Let U \u2282 C be an open domain, and f be a continuous function on\nU . Set \u03a9 = {z \u2208 U : f (z) 6= 0}, and suppose that f is holomorphic on \u03a9. Then f is holomorphic on\nU.\n23\n\n\fIn fact, we apply the theorem to g, and obtain that g is holomorphic on B. But since B1 6= \u2205,\ng 6\u2261 0. As a result B1C = {y \u2208 B : g(y) = 0} doesn't have any limit point. Notice that B1C \u2283 B2 :=\n{y \u2208 B, d\u03c6\ndz\u0304 (y) 6= 0}, and B2 is open, so it is an open set without limit point. Therefore B2 = \u2205, which\nmeans that \u03c6 is complex analytic on B.\n2\n\nHence \u03c6 is complex analytic or anti-analytic on B = B(p1 (x), r) \u2229 P01 .\nLemma 3.29. If x \u2208 E \u2229 B(0, 1) is of type P0 , then there exists r = r(x) > 0 such that\nE \u2229 B(x, r) = (P0 + x) \u2229 B(x, r).\n\n(3.30)\n\nProof. Let B(x, r0 ) be a C 1 ball for the point x, in which E coincides with the image of P0 + x by\na C 1 function \u03c6 : E \u2229 B(x, r0 ) = \u03c6((P0 + x) \u2229 B(x, r0 )), where \u03c6 is a diffeomorphism and \u03c6(x) = x,\nD\u03c6(x) = Id (c.f. Thm 1.35). Set Ai = \u03c6(P0i + x) \u2229 B(x, r0 ), i = 1, 2. Then Ai are transversal C 1\nmanifolds, [A1 \u222a A2 ] \u2229 B(x, r0 ) = E \u2229 B(x, r0 ) and A1 \u2229 A2 = {x}. Moreover, the tangent plane to Ai\nat the point x is P0i , i = 1, 2. In particular, P01 (A1 ) contains a neighborhood U of p10 (x) in P01 .\nBy a similar argument as the one in Lemma 3.22, there exists r2 <\n\nr1\n2\n\nsuch that in B(x, r2 ), A2 is\n\nthe graph of the analytic or anti-analytic complex function \u03c8 : P02 + x \u2192 P01 , where \u03c8 = p10 \u25e6 \u03c6 on\nP02 + x \u2229 B(x, r2 )). Without loss of generality, suppose that it is complex analytic.\nIf \u03c8 is not constant, it will be an open map, because it is analytic. Therefore p10 (A2 ) also contains\na neighborhood U 0 of p10 (x) in P01 . But A1 \u2229 A2 = {x}, hence for every point y \u2208 U \u2229 U 0 \\{p10 (x)},\np10\n\n\u22121\n\n{y} admits at least two points in E, one in A1 , and the other in A2 . But U \u2229 U 0 \\{p10 (x)} is of\n\nnon zero measure, this contradicts (3.7).\nHence \u03c8 is constant. As a result,\n(3.31)\n\n\u03c6((P02 + x) \u2229 B(x, r2 )) = P02 \u2229 B(x, r2 ).\n\nWe can do the same for \u03c6(P01 + x), and we obtain that there exists r < r2 such that in B(x, r),\n\u03c6(P01 + x) is P01 + x itself. This completes the proof of Lemma 3.29.\n\n2\n\nLet us sum up a little. The minimal set E has only two types of points : planar points, around\nwhich the set E is a C 1 (locally analytic or anti analytic) manifold; and P0 points, around which E\nis locally P0 itself. Hence in fact,\nThe set E is composed of countably many transversal C 1 manifolds S1 , S2 , * * * , Sn , * * * .\n(3.32)\n\nThey are locally analytic or anti analytic, and at any of their intersections,\nE is locally a translation of P0 .\n\nWe know that (3.7) holds for almost all z \u2208 p10 (E). But now let us look at those points x in E\nwhere the projection p10 is not injective.\n24\n\n\fLemma 3.33. Suppose that y1 , y2 \u2208 E \u2229 B(0, 1) are such that p10 (y1 ) = p10 (y2 ). Then at least one of\nthe two yi is such that E coincides with P02 + yi in a neighborhood of yi .\nProof. By the argument near (3.21), at least one of the tangent planes Ty1 E, Ty2 E is P02 . Suppose\nTy1 E = P02 for example. Then by Lemma 3.22, there exists s1 > 0 such that in B(y1 , s1 ), E is the\ngraph of a complex analytic or anti-analytic function (under the basis given before) \u03c61 : P02 \u2192 P01 ,\nwith \u03c61 (0) = p10 (y1 ), D\u03c61 = 0.\nFirst, if the tangent plane Ty2 E of E at y2 is not P02 , then again by the argument near (3.21),\nthere exists s2 > 0 such that B(y1 , s1 ) \u2229 B(y2 , s2 ) = \u2205, and B(p10 (y2 ), s1 ) \u2229 P01 \u2282 p10 (B(y2 , s2 ) \u2229 E).\nTherefore p10 (B(y1 , s1 ) \u2229 E) is of measure zero, because of (3.7) and p10 (y1 ) = p10 (y2 ). Hence \u03c61 has to\nbe constant, otherwise it will be an open map, which means p10 (B(y1 , s1 ) \u2229 E) contains an open set in\nP01 , which is of positive measure, and thus leads to a contradiction. So in B(y1 , s1 ), E coincides with\nP02 + y1 . (See the picture 3-1 below, the two points on the left.)\n\n3-1\nIf Ty2 E is also P02 , then in B(y2 , s2 ), E is the graph of a complex analytic or anti-analytic function\n\u03c62 : P02 \u2192 P01 . Then at least one of the two \u03c6i , i = 1, 2 is constant, otherwise all of them are open\nmaps, so that p10 (B(y1 , s1 ) \u2229 E)) \u2229 p10 (B(y2 , s2 ) \u2229 E)) contains an open set in P01 , which contradicts\n2\n\n(3.7).\n\nLemma 3.34. If there exists a point in P01 \u2229 B(0, 1) whose pre-image by p10 contains more than one\npoint in E \u2229 B(0, 1), then P02 \u2229 B(0, 1) \u2282 E.\nProof.\nLemma 3.33 says that if there exists a point in P01 \u2229 B(0, 1) whose pre-image by p10 contains more\nthan one point in E, then there exists a piece of P02 above it. Denote this piece by (P02 + x) \u2229 B(x, r).\nOn the other hand, by (3.32), E \u2229 B(0, 1) is composed of at most countably many transversal C 1\nmanifolds S1 , * * * , Sl , * * * , so there exists i such that (P02 + x) \u2229 B(x, r) \u2282 Si .\n25\n\n\fWe claim that Si = (P02 + x) \u2229 B(0, 1). So set A = {y \u2208 Si : there exists r = ry > 0 such that Si \u2229\nB(y, r) = (P02 + y) \u2229 B(y, r)}. By definition, A is open in Si . On the other hand, for any y \u2208 \u0100 \u2229 Si ,\nthere exists a sequence yn \u2208 A that converges to y. But Si is a C 1 manifold, hence the tangent\nplane Ty Si = limn\u2192\u221e Tyn Si = P02 . Therefore there exists r > 0 such that in B(y, r), Si is the graph\nof a complex analytic (the anti-analytic case is exactly the same) \u03c8 : P02 \u2192 P01 . But \u03c8 0 = 0 on\n{p20 (yn )} \u222a {p20 (y)}, which, if y 6\u2208 A, is a infinite set with a limit point. So \u03c8 0 \u2261 0 in p20 (B(y, r)),\nso that \u03c8 is constant, which yields that y \u2208 A. So A is closed. But Si is connected, A is open and\nclosed and non-empty, hence A = Si . But Si is a C 1 manifold, so the only possibility is that it is a\npiece of (P02 + x) \u2229 B(0, 1). However, Si is both closed and open in (P02 + x) \u2229 B(0, 1), because A is\nboth open and closed in (P02 + x) \u2229 B(0, 1) by the same argument as above, and Si = A. As a result,\nSi = (P02 + x) \u2229 B(0, 1).\nBy (3.3), S i \u2229 \u2202B(0, 1) \u2282 E \u2229 \u2202B(0, 1) \u2282 P0 \u2229 \u2202B(0, 1), since E is closed. This implies that\n2\n\nSi = P02 \u2229 B(0, 1). Hence P02 \u2229 B(0, 1) \u2282 E.\n\nRemark 3.35. By a similar discussion, if p20 is not injective on E \u2229 B(0, 1), then P01 \u2229 B(0, 1) \u2282 E.\nLemma 3.36. The set E contains at least one point of type P0 .\nProof. First of all, by Lemma 3.34 and Remark 3.35, if neither of the pi0 , i = 1, 2 is injective, then\nP0 \u2229 B(0, 1) = (P01 \u222a P02 ) \u2229 B(0, 1) \u2282 E. In particular, there exists a P0 point.\nThus if E contains no P0 point, then at least one of the pi0 , i = 1, 2 is injective. Without loss\nof generality, we suppose p10 is injective on E \u2229 B(0, 1), and E contains no P0 point. Notice that\n(3.2) is true for E \u2229 B(0, 1), and we know that p10 (E \u2229 \u2202B(0, 1)) = {0} \u222a (P01 \u2229 \u2202B(0, 1)), hence\np10 (E \u2229 B(0, 1)) \u2283 P01 \u2229 B(0, 1)\\{0}. Hence the injectivity gives\n(3.37)\n\nfor all z \u2208 P01 \u2229 B(0, 1)\\{0}, ]{p10\n\n\u22121\n\n(z) \u2229 E \u2229 B(0, 1)} = 1,\n\nand\n(3.38)\n\n]{p10\n\n\u22121\n\n(0) \u2229 E \u2229 B(0, 1)} \u2264 1.\n\nSo there exits \u03c8 : P01 \u2229 B(0, 1)\\{0} \u2192 P02 such that E \u2229 B(0, 1) is its graph. Therefore above\nthose points y \u2208 E whose tangent planes Ty E 6= P02 , \u03c8 is locally a complex analytic or anti-analytic\nfunction (by Lemma 3.22).\nWe claim that there is no singular point y \u2208 E \u2229 B(0, 1) with Ty E = P02 . In fact, if y is a\nsuch point, then by Lemma 3.22 (recall that we have supposed that E contains no P0 point), in a\nneighborhood B(y, r), E is the graph of a complex analytic or anti-analytic function g from P02 to\nP01 . Suppose p20 (y) = 0 for simplicity, hence g 0 (0) = 0. Then 0 is a zero of g \u2212 g(0) of order at\nleast 2. Thus in a punctured neighborhood O of g(0) \u2208 C, each point has at least 2 pre-images. So\n26\n\n\fO \u2282 {z \u2208 P01 : ]{p10\n\n\u22121\n\n{z} \u2229 E} \u2265 2}. But O is of positive measure because it is open. This contradicts\n\n(3.7).\nSo there is no singular point for \u03c8, therefore \u03c8 is a C 1 function on P01 \u2229B(0, 1)\\{0}, and E \u2229B(0, 1)\nis its graph. For each point x \u2208 P01 \u2229B(0, 1)\\{0}, \u03c8 is analytic or anti analytic in a small neighborhood\nof x. Moreover \u03c8 is bounded. By the same argument in Lemma 3.22, we know that \u03c8 is globally\nanalytic or anti-analytic on any compact subdomain of P01 \u2229 B(0, 1)\\{0}, hence is globally analytic or\nanti-analytic on P01 \u2229 B(0, 1)\\{0}. Suppose it is analytic. Then since \u03c8 is bounded around {0}, we\ncan extend \u03c8 to P01 \u2229 B(0, 1). But since \u03c8 is analytic with \u03c8|\u2202B(0,1) = 0, the graph of \u03c8 has to be\nP01 \u2229 B(0, 1), hence\n(3.39)\n\nE \u2229 B(0, 1) \u2282 graph(\u03c8) = P01 \u2229 B(0, 1).\n\nThis contradicts the hypothesis (3.3).\n2\n\nThus we obtain the existence of a point of type P0 in E.\n\nProof of Theorem 3.1. We know by Lemma 3.36 that E contains a point x of type P0 . By Lemma\n3.29, there exists r > 0 such that E \u2229 B(x, r) = (P0 + x) \u2229 B(x, r). But in this case, neither p10 nor p20 is\ninjective on E\u2229B(0, 1). Hence by Lemma 3.34 and Remark 3.35, P0 \u2229B(0, 1) = (P01 \u222aP02 )\u2229B(0, 1) \u2282 E.\nBut H 2 (E) = H 2 (P0 \u2229 B(0, 1)), and E \u2229 B(0, 1) is reduced. As a result, E \u2229 B(0, 1) = P0 \u2229 B(0, 1).\n2\n\nThis completes the proof of Theorem 3.1.\n\n4\n\nExistence of minimal sets\n\nNow we begin to prove Theorem 1.2.\nSuppose that the conclusion of Theorem 1.2 is not true. Then there exists a sequence of unions of\n2 planes Pk = Pk1 \u222a\u03b8k Pk2 \u2282 R4 which are not minimal, with \u03b8k \u2265\n\n\u03c0\n2\n\n\u2212 k1 . Moreover, we can suppose\n\nthat all the Pk1 are equal to P01 .\nOur proof would be simpler if we could find a sequence of minimizers Ek such that for each k, Ek\nminimizes the measure among all deformations of Pk \u2229 B(0, 1) in B(0, 1). (We shall call such a set a\nsolution of Plateau's problem). It is a standard fact about the Hausdorff distance that we can find\na subsequence (which we shall still denote by {Ek } to save notation) such that {Ek } converges to a\nlimit E\u221e . Since Pk \u2229 \u2202B(0, 1) = Ek \u2229 \u2202B(0, 1), and Pk \u2229 \u2202B(0, 1) \u2192 P0 \u2229 \u2202B(0, 1), we can hope to\nprove that the boundary of E\u221e is P0 \u2229 \u2202B(0, 1). Moreover, since each Ek is minimal in B(0, 1), their\nlimit E\u221e has to be minimal in B(0, 1), too (c.f.[4] Thm 4.1). Notice also that (3.2) is true since E\u221e is\nthe limit of a sequence of deformations, we would deduce that E\u221e = P0 \u2229 B(0, 1), by the uniqueness\ntheorem 3.1. We could begin our stopping time argument as soon as we got such a sequence.\n\n27\n\n\fUnfortunately we do not know any theorem which guarantees the existence of a solution of Plateau's\nproblem. So we have to work more to get through this. We are disposed of a weaker existence theorem:\nTheorem 4.1 (Existence of minimal sets; c.f. [9], Thm 6.1.7). Let U \u2282 Rn be an open domain,\n0 < d < n, and let F be a class of non-empty sets relatively closed in U and satisfying (1.17), which\nis stable by deformations in U . Suppose that\ninf H d (F ) < \u221e.\n\n(4.2)\n\nF \u2208F\n\nThen there exists M > 0 (depends only on d and n), a sequence (Fk ) of elements of F, and a set E\nof dimension d relatively closed in U that verifies (1.17), such that:\n(1) There exists a sequence of compact sets {Km }m\u2208N in U with Km \u2282 Km+1 for all m and\n\u222am\u2208N Km = U , such that\nlim dH (Fk \u2229 Km , E \u2229 Km ) = 0 for all m \u2208 N;\n\n(4.3)\n\nk\u2192\u221e\n\n(2) For all open sets V such that V is relatively compact in U , from a certain rank,\n(4.4)\n\nFk is (M, +\u221e)-quasiminimal in V ;\n\n(see Definition 4.5 below)\n(3) H d (E) \u2264 inf F \u2208F H d (F ) ;\n(4) E is minimal in U .\nDefinition 4.5 (Quasiminimal set). Let 0 < d < n be two integers, M > 0, \u03b4 > 0, let U be open in\nRn . The set E is said to be (M, \u03b4)\u2212quasi minimal in U (E \u2282 QM (U, M, \u03b4) for short) if E is closed\nc ) < \u03b4,\nin U , (1.17) is true, and for every deformation \u03c6 in U as in Definition 1.11 such that diam(W\nH d (E \u2229 W1 ) \u2264 M H d (\u03c61 (E \u2229 W1 )).\n\n(4.6)\n\nRemark 4.7. In Theorem 4.1, we can also ask that {Fk } is a minimizing sequence, i.e., limk\u2192\u221e H 2 (Fk ) =\ninf F \u2208F H d (F ).\nTheorem 4.1 is a weaker result, which gives a certain type of minimizer, without preserving the\nboundary condition, and this minimizer may not be in the class F, either. But for our case, we do not\nneed all these strong properties. Some weaker properties are sufficient for us to carry on the proof (as\nwe will see soon).\nRecall that Pk = Pk1 \u222a\u03b8k Pk2 is a sequence of unions of two planes which are not minimal, with\n\u03b8k >\n\n\u03c0\n2\n\n\u2212 k1 . Moreover we suppose that all the Pk1 's are the same. Thus Pk1 = P01 . Denote by P02 the\n\nplane orthogonal to P01 , P0 = P01 \u222a\u22a5 P02 . Then Pk \u2229 B(0, 1) converges to P0 \u2229 B(0, 1) for the Hausdorff\ndistance.\n28\n\n\fProposition 4.8. For each k, there exists a closed set Ek \u2282 B(0, 1) such that\n(1) Ek is minimal in R4 \\[Pk \\B(0, 1)];\n(2) \u2202B(0, 1) \u2229 Ek = \u2202B(0, 1) \u2229 Pk ;\n(3) pik (Ek ) \u2283 Pki \u2229 B(0, 1), where pik denotes the projection on Pki , i = 1, 2;\n(4) H 2 (Ek ) < H 2 (Pk \u2229 B(0, 1)) = 2\u03c0;\n(5) Ek is contained in the convex hull of Pk \u2229 B(0, 1).\nProof of (1) and (4) of Proposition 4.8. Fix a k. Take U = R4 \\[Pk \\B(0, 1)], and let F be the\nclass of all deformations of Pk \u2229 B(0, 1) in U . Then by Theorem 4.1, and Remark 4.7, for d = 2, there\nexists a minimizing sequence of sets Fl \u2208 F that are also uniformly quasiminimal in U , with a uniform\nconstant M . Moreover the sequence converges under the Hausdorff distance. Denote by Ek its limit.\nThen by the conclusion of Theorem 4.1, the terms (1) and (4) of Proposition 4.8 are automatically\ntrue. In (4) we have a strict inequality because we have supposed that Pk is not minimal.\n\n2\n\nFor (3), we begin by proving the following lemma.\nLemma 4.9. Let P be a plane in R4 , and p the projection on P . let \u03c6 be a Lipschitz mapping from\nR4 to R4 , such that \u03c6|P \u2229B(0,1)C = id. Then\np[\u03c6(P \u2229 B(0, 1))] \u2283 P \u2229 B(0, 1).\n\n(4.10)\n\nProof. We prove it by contradiction.\nSuppose that there exists x \u2208 P \u2229B(0, 1) such that x 6\u2208 p[\u03c6(P \u2229B(0, 1))]. Then x \u2208 P \u2229B(0, 1), since\nP \u2229 \u2202B(0, 1) = \u03c6(P \u2229 \u2202B(0, 1)) \u2282 p[\u03c6(P \u2229 B(0, 1))] by hypothesis. Then there exists r > 0 such that\nB(x, r) \u2282 B(0, 1). On the other hand, P \u2229 B(0, 1) is compact, hence its image p[\u03c6(P \u2229 B(0, 1))] by the\ncontinuous map p \u25e6 \u03c6 is also compact, such that {p[\u03c6(P \u2229 B(0, 1))]}C is open. As a result, there exists\nr0 < r such that B(x, r0 )\u2229p[\u03c6(P \u2229B(0, 1))] = \u2205. In other words, \u03c6(P \u2229B(0, 1)) \u2282 R4 \\p\u22121 [B(x, r0 )\u2229P ].\nDefine g : R4 \\p\u22121 [B(x, r0 )\u2229P ] \u2192 p\u22121 [\u2202B(0, 1)\u2229P ] as follows. For x \u2208 R4 \\p\u22121 [B(0, 1)\u2229P ], let g(x)\nbe the shortest distance projection of R4 onto p\u22121 [B(0, 1)\u2229P ], and for y \u2208 [p\u22121 [(B(0, 1)\\B(x, r0 ))\u2229P ],\nlet g(y) be the intersection of p\u22121 [\u2202B(0, 1) \u2229 P ] with the ray [x, y) of end point x and passing through\ny. Then g is continuous.\nNotice that \u03c6(P \u2229B(0, 1)) \u2282 R4 \\p\u22121 [B(x, r0 )\u2229P ], hence p\u25e6g \u25e6\u03c6 is Lipschitz, and sends P \u2229B(0, 1)\ncontinuously to P \u2229 \u2202B(0, 1), with all points of P \u2229 \u2202B(0, 1) fixed. This is impossible.\n\n2\n\nProof of Proposition 4.8 (3). We know that Ek is the limit of a sequence of deformations Fl =\n\u03c6l (Pk ) of Pk . Then for each l, we have, by Lemma 4.9,\n(4.11)\n\npik (Fl ) \u2283 pik [\u03c6l (Pki \u2229 B(0, 1))] \u2283 Pki \u2229 B(0, 1), i = 1, 2.\n\n29\n\n\fAs a result,\npik (Ek ) \u2283 Pki \u2229 B(0, 1), i = 1, 2.\n\n(4.12)\n\n2\nWe still have to prove (2) and (5) of Proposition 4.8. In fact all we have to do is to prove (5),\nbecause it says that Ek is contained in the convex hull C of Pk \u2229 B(0, 1), which gives (2).\nLet us verify that Ek \u2282 B(0, 1). First of all we claim that for each \u000f > 0, there exists N = N (\u000f) > 0\nsuch that for all l > N ,\nFl \u2282 B(B(0, 1) \u222a Pk , \u000f),\n\n(4.13)\n\nThat is to say, Fl is contained in an \u000f\u2212neighborhood of the union of the unit ball and the boundary\nof U .\nIn fact, those Fl are uniformly quasiminimal in U , hence are locally uniformly Ahlfors regular in\nU (c.f. [7] Proposition 4.1). This means that there exists a constant C > 1 such that for all l, for all\nx \u2208 Fl and all r > 0 with B(x, 2r) \u2282 U ,\nC \u22121 r2 \u2264 H 2 (Fl \u2229 B(x, r)) \u2264 Cr2 .\n\n(4.14)\n\nThen if there exists x \u2208 Fl such that d(x, B(0, 1) \u222a Pk ) > \u000f, we should have B(x, \u000f) \u2282 U , and by\nthe Ahlfors regularity,\n1\nH 2 (Fl \u2229 B(x, \u000f)) \u2265 (4C)\u22121 \u000f2 .\n2\n\n(4.15)\n\nNow we deform Fl into B(0, 1) by the radial projection \u03c0 on B(0, 1). Here for each l, Fl is\na deformation of Pk \u2229 B(0, 1) in U , it means that there exists a compact set K \u2282 U , such that\nFl \\K = Pk \u2229 B(0, 1)\\K. The compactness of K gives that 0 < d = d(K, \u2202U ) = d(K, Pk \\B(0, 1)),\nand there exists R > 0 such that K \u2282 B(0, R). Set V = B(0, R)\\B(Pk \\B(0, 1), d). Then in V , \u03c0\nis homotopic to the identity map. Now we set \u03c0 0 : U \u2192 B(0, 1) \u2229 U, \u03c0 0 (x) = t(x)x + (1 \u2212 t(x))\u03c0(x),\nwhere t(x) = min{2d(x, V )/d, 1}. Then \u03c0 0 is a deformation on U , and \u03c0 0 |V = \u03c0|V , which gives\n\u03c0 0 (Fl ) = \u03c0(Fl ). Hence the set \u03c0(Fl ) is a deformation of Pk in U . In other words \u03c0(Fl ) \u2208 F.\nLemma 4.16. Let E be rectifiable such that E \u2229 B(0, 1 + \u000f) = \u2205. Then\nH 2 (\u03c0(E)) \u2264\n\n(4.17)\n\nProof. We are going to prove that \u03c0 is\n\n1\nH 2 (E).\n(1 + \u000f)2\n\n1\n1+\u000f -Lipschitz\n\non E, which gives (4.17).\n\nDenote by \u03c0\u000f the shortest distance projection on the ball B(0, 1 + \u000f). Then \u03c0\u000f is 1-Lipschitz, and\n\u03c0\u000f (R4 \\B(0, 1 + \u000f)) \u2282 \u2202B(0, 1 + \u000f). On the other hand. \u03c0 is\n4\n\nE \u2282 R \\B(0, 1 + \u000f), then \u03c0 = \u03c0 \u25e6 \u03c0\u000f is\n\n1\n1+\u000f -Lipschitz\n\n30\n\non E.\n\n1\n1+\u000f -Lipschitz\n\non \u2202B(0, 1 + \u000f). So if\n2\n\n\fLet us return to our sets Fl . We have B(x, 21 \u000f) \u2229 B(0, 1 + 21 \u000f) = \u2205, since x 6\u2208 B(0, 1 + \u000f), and hence\n1\n1\nH 2 (\u03c0(Fl )) \u2264 H 2 (\u03c0(Fl \\B(x, \u000f))) + H 2 (\u03c0(Fl \u2229 B(x, \u000f)))\n2\n2\n1\n1\n1\n2\n2\n\u2264 H (Fl \\B(x, \u000f)) +\nH (Fl \u2229 B(x, \u000f))\n2\n2\n(1 + 12 \u000f)2\n1\n4\u000f + \u000f2\nH 2 (Fl \u2229 B(x, \u000f))\n4 + 4\u000f + \u000f2\n2\n2\n2\n\u000f\n4\u000f + \u000f\n\u2264 H 2 (Fl ) \u2212\n4 + 4\u000f + \u000f2 4C\n\n(4.18)\n\n\u2264 H 2 (Fl ) \u2212\n\n= H 2 (Fl ) \u2212 C(\u000f),\nwhere C(\u000f) > 0 for all \u000f > 0, and C(\u000f) does not depend on l for l large.\nWe know that {Fl } is a minimizing sequence, therefore for all \u000f > 0, there exists N > 0 such that\nfor l > N ,\n1\nH 2 (Fl ) \u2264 inf H 2 (E) + C(\u000f) < H 2 (\u03c0(Fl )) + C(\u000f).\nE\u2208F\n2\n\n(4.19)\n\nHence (4.18) is not true, which means that Fl \u2282 B(B(0, 1) \u222a Pk , \u000f) \u2229 U , thus we obtain (4.13).\nAs a result, since Ek is the limit of Fl ,\nEk \u2282 \u2229\u000f B(B(0, 1) \u222a Pk , \u000f) \u2229 U \u2282 B(0, 1).\n\n(4.20)\n\nLemma 4.21. Let C \u2282 Rn be a closed convex symmetric (with respect to the origin) set with nonempty interior. Then for all \u000f > 0, there exists \u03b4 > 0 and a 1-Lipschitz retraction f of Rn onto C\nsuch that f is 1 \u2212 \u03b4-Lipschitz on Rn \\B(C, \u000f).\nProof.

Then\n(4.28)\n\n||w \u2212 v|| \u2265 ||pL (w) \u2212 pL (v)|| = ||w \u2212 x|| cos \u03b21 + ||x \u2212 y|| + ||v \u2212 y|| cos \u03b22 .\n\nBut w, v \u2208 Rn \\B(Ca,b , \u000f), hence we have ||w \u2212 x|| > \u000f, ||v \u2212 y|| > \u000f, therefore\n||w \u2212 v|| \u2265 ||x \u2212 y|| + 2\u000f cos arctan\n(4.29)\n\n1\n2M (a, b, A)||x \u2212 y||\n\n= (1 + \u000fC(a, b, A))||x \u2212 y||,\n32\n\n\fwith C(a, b, A) > 0.\nNotice that (4.29) is true for all pairs of x, y such that \u03b1x,y <\n\n\u03c0\n2.\n\nHence \u03c0a,b is locally\n\n1\n1+\u000fC(a,b,A)) -\n\nLipschitz on Rn \\B(Ca,b , \u000f).\nReturn to the proof of the lemma. Fix an arbitrary \u000f > 0. Then by (4.23) and (4.24), there exists\na, b > 0 such that\n\u000f\nC \u2282 Ca,b \u2282 B(Ca,b , ) \u2282 B(C, \u000f).\n2\n\n(4.30)\n\nNow denote by \u03c0C the shortest distance projection on C. Denote by f = \u03c0C \u25e6 \u03c0a,b for a pair of a, b\nwhich satisfies (4.30). We want to prove f is the desired map for Lemma 4.21. Since \u03c0C is 1-Lipschitz,\nfor proving the lemma, it is sufficient to prove that \u03c0a,b is locally 1 \u2212 \u03b4-Lipschitz on Rn \\B(Ca,b , 2\u000f ).\nThen by (4.29), we take \u03b4 such that 1 \u2212 \u03b4 =\n\n1\n,\n1+ 12 \u000fC(a,b,A))\n\nand we obtain the conclusion.\n\n2\n\nCorollary 4.31. Let E \u2282 Rn \\B(C, \u000f) be a rectifiable set and f be as in the lemma, then\nH d (f (E)) \u2264 (1 \u2212 \u03b4)d H d (E).\n\n(4.32)\n\n2\nNow let us return to the proof of Proposition 4.8. Recall that here C is the convex hull of\nPk \u2229 B(0, 1).\nProof of (2) and (5) of Proposition 4.8.\nWe will prove that\nfor all \u000f > 0, Ek \u2282 B(C, 2\u000f).\n\n(4.33)\n\nIf it is not true, i.e. if Ek \\B(C, 2\u000f) 6= \u2205, then by Ahlfors regularity, H 2 (Ek \\B(C, 2\u000f)) > 0. We apply\nCorollary 4.31 to Ek \\B(C, 2\u000f) and the convex set B(C, \u000f), and obtain that there exists a Lipschitz\nmap f\u000f of Rn in B(C, \u000f), such that\n(4.34)\n\nH 2 (f\u000f (Ek )) < H 2 (Ek ),\n\nwhere f\u000f is as in Lemma 4.21. Then we will get (4.33) if we know that f\u000f (Ek ) is a deformation of Ek\nin U .\nBut we already know that Ek \u2282 B(0, 1).\n\nSo W\u000f := {x \u2208 Ek , \u03c0\u000f (x) 6= x} is contained in\n\nB(0, 1)\\B(C, \u000f), which is compact and far from the boundary of U . Denote by d(W\u000f , \u2202U ) = d,\nand set\n(4.35)\n\ng : Rn \u2192 B(C, \u000f), f (x) = t(x)x + (1 \u2212 t(x))f\u000f (x), t(x) = min{2d(x, W\u000f )/d, 1},\n\n33\n\n\fthen g is a deformation in U , and\n(4.36)\n\ng(Ek ) = f\u000f (Ek ).\n\nTherefore, if Ek \\B(C, 2\u000f) 6= \u2205, then g decreases strictly the measure of Ek , which contradicts the\nfact that Ek is minimal. Hence we have (4.33). But (4.33) is true for all \u000f > 0, hence we have\nEk \u2282 C,\n\n(4.37)\n\nfrom which (5) follows. (2) is a direct corollary of (5). This completes the proof of Proposition 4.8.2\n\nCorollary 4.38. For each subsequence {nk } such that Enk converges in B(0, 1) for the Hausdorff\ndistance, the limit is P0 \u2229 B(0, 1).\nProof. Take such a sequence {nk }. Denote by E\u221e the limit of Enk . We want to apply Theorem 3.1,\nso we should check its hypotheses for E\u221e .\nFirst, by [4] Thm 4.1, which says that the limit under the Hausdorff distance of a sequence of\nminimal sets is minimal, we know that E\u221e is also minimal in B(0, 1), because each Enk is.\nNext, (3.2) follows by Proposition 4.8(3) and the fact that E\u221e is the limit of Enk .\nTo verify (3.3), if we denote by Ck the convex hull of Pk \u2229 B(0, 1) (and C0 the convex hull of\nP0 \u2229 B(0, 1)), then by Proposition 4.8, Enk \u2282 Cnk . Since E\u221e is the limit of Enk , for each m > 0, there\n1\n1\n1\n) \u2282 B(Cnk , m\n) \u2282 \u222a\u221e\nexists K(m) > 0 such that for all k > K(m), E\u221e \u2282 B(Enk , m\nk=K(m) B(Cnk , m ).\n\nWe can also ask that K(m) > k(l) when m > l. As a result we have\n(4.39)\n\n\u221e\nE\u221e \u2282 \u2229\u221e\nm=1 \u222ak=K(m) B(Cnk ,\n\n1\n) = C0 ,\nm\n\nand therefore\n(4.40)\n\nE\u221e \u2229 \u2202B(0, 1) \u2282 C0 \u2229 \u2202B(0, 1) = P0 \u2229 \u2202B(0, 1).\n\nOn the other hand, since E\u221e is the limit of the Enk , it contains limk\u2192\u221e Enk \u2229 \u2202B(0, 1) = P0 \u2229\n\u2202B(0, 1).\nHence\n(4.41)\n\nE\u221e \u2229 \u2202B(0, 1) = P0 \u2229 \u2202B(0, 1).\n\nwhich gives (3.3).\nFor (3.4), Proposition 4.8 (4) gives that that H 2 (Enk ) < 2\u03c0. But Enk and E\u221e are minimal sets,\nby the lower semi continuity of Hausdorff measures for minimal sets ([4] Thm 3.4),\n(4.42)\n\nH 2 (E\u221e \u2229 B(0, 1)) \u2264 lim inf H 2 (Enk \u2229 B(0, 1)) \u2264 2\u03c0.\nk\n\n34\n\n\fThe equality follows from (3.2), and Lemmas 2.27 and 2.14.\n2\n\nHence by Theorem 3.1, E\u221e = P0 \u2229 B(0, 1).\n\nNotice that B(0, 1) is compact, hence there exists a subsequence of {Ek } that converges. We still\ndenote this subsequence by {Ek } for short. Then by Corollary 4.38, the limit is P0 \u2229 B(0, 1). So from\nnow on, we will concentrate on this sequence {Ek }k>0 that converges to P0 \u2229 B(0, 1).\n\n5\n\nCritical radius\n\nFor our sequence {Ek }, once again, if for each k, Ek is a deformation of Pk , then there should be some\nsort of pinch at the center, because otherwise, the deformation is injective, and Ek is therefore an\nessentially disjoint union of images of Pk1 and Pk2 . But since Pki is minimal, i = 1, 2, its image always\nhas a larger measure than Pki , therefore Ek is not a better competitor.\nNow since we have to pinch, we know that Ek has to get far away from Pk somewhere, and\nintuitively we have to pay a price for this. In fact, the main issue of the proof is to understand why a\npinch costs more than all that it could save for us.\nHowever Ek is not necessarily a deformation of Pk , so what we said just now is just for giving an\nidea on what we are going to do, that is, to find the place where Ek begins to get away from Pk .\nSo for \u000f sufficiently small, we want to find a center o, which is not far from the origin, and a scale\nr, such that Ek is \u000fr0 near some translation of Pk in B(o, r0 ) for all r0 \u2265 2r, but is not \u000fr near any\ntranslation of Pk in B(o, r). Then this is the place that we are looking for, and r is the critical radius.\nAs a result, in the small ball B(o, 14 r) where the pinch takes place, probably we cannot see very\nclearly what happens, so we only control the measure of Ek by an argument of projection, using\nCorollary 2.45. However, for the part outside the small ball, Ek is near the two planes, and hence is\nregular, by the regularity property of minimal sets. So we can treat this part more precisely. And\nfinally we will be able to prove that pinching will make us lose more measure on these regular parts\nthan that we can gain in the small ball.\nSo let's begin by looking for the critical radius in this section, by a stopping time argument.\nFor each, k \u2208 N and i = 1, 2, set\n(5.1)\n\nCki (x, r) = (pik )\u22121 (B(0, r) \u2229 Pki ) + x,\n\nwhere pik is the orthogonal projection on Pki , and\n(5.2)\n\nDk (x, r) = Ck1 (x, r) \u2229 Ck2 (x, r).\n\n35\n\n\fSo Cki (x, r) is a cylinder and Dk (x, r) is the intersection of two cylinders. It is not hard to see that\nDk (x, r) \u2283 B(x, r) and Dk (0, 1) \u2229 Pk = B(0, 1) \u2229 Pk .\nWe say that two sets E, F are \u000fr near each other in an open set U if\n(5.3)\n\ndr,U (E, F ) < \u000f,\n\nwhere\n(5.4)\n\ndr,U (E, F ) =\n\n1\nmax{sup{d(y, F ) : y \u2208 E \u2229 U }, sup{d(y, E) : y \u2208 F \u2229 U }}.\nr\n\nWe set also\ndkx,r (E, F ) = dr,Dk (x,r) (E, F )\n(5.5)\n=\n\n1\nmax{sup{d(y, F ) : y \u2208 E \u2229 Dk (x, r)}, sup{d(y, E) : y \u2208 F \u2229 Dk (x, r)}}.\nr\n\nRemark 5.6. We should be clear about the fact that\ndr,U (E, F ) 6=\n\n(5.7)\n\n1\ndH (E \u2229 U, F \u2229 U ).\nr\n\nTo see this, we can take U = Dk (x, r), and set En = \u2202Dk (x, r + n1 ) and Fn = \u2202Dk (x, r \u2212 n1 ). Then\nwe have\ndkx,r (En , Fn ) \u2192 0\n\n(5.8)\nand\n(5.9)\n\n1\n1\ndH (En \u2229 Dk (x, r), Fn \u2229 Dk (x, r)) = dH (En \u2229 Dk (x, r), \u2205) = \u221e.\nr\nr\n\nSo dr,U measures rather how the part of one set in the open set U could be approximated by the other\nset, and vice versa. However we always have\n(5.10)\n\ndkx,r (E, F ) \u2264\n\n1\ndH (E \u2229 Dk (x, r), F \u2229 Dk (x, r)).\nr\n\nNow let us recall that {Ek } is a sequence of sets as in Proposition 4.8, with \u03b8k >\n\n\u03c0\n2\n\n\u2212 k1 , which\n\nconverges to P0 \u2229 B(0, 1).\nProposition 5.11. There exists \u000f0 > 0, such that if \u000f < \u000f0 , then for all k large, there exists rk \u2208]0, 12 [\nand ok \u2208 B(0, 12\u000f) such that Ek is 2\u000frk near Pk + ok in Dk (ok , 2rk (1 \u2212 12\u000f)), but not \u000frk near Pk + q\nin Dk (ok , rk ) for any q \u2208 R4 .\nRemark 5.12. We will also use the construction for information about intermediate scales in the\nproof.\n36\n\n\fProof.\nWe fix \u000f and k, and set si = 2\u2212i for i \u2265 0. Set D(x, r) = Dk (x, r), dx,r = dkx,r for short.\nWe proceed in the following way.\nStep 1: Denote by q0 = q1 = O, then in D(q0 , s0 ), Ek is \u000fs0 near Pk +q1 if k is large, since Ek \u2192 P0\nand Pk \u2192 P0 and hence d0,1 (Ek , Pk ) \u2192 0.\nStep 2: If in D(q1 , s1 ) Ek is not \u000fs1 near Pk + q for any q, we stop; if not, there exists a q2 such\nthat Ek is \u000fs1 near Pk + q2 in D(q1 , s1 ). Here we also ask that \u000f be small enough (say, \u000f <\nthat q2 \u2208\n(5.13)\n\nD(q1 , 12 s1 ),\n\n1\n100 )\n\nso\n\nthanks to the conclusion of step 1. Then in D(q1 , s1 ), we have simultaneously :\n\ndq1 ,s1 (Ek , Pk + q1 ) \u2264 s\u22121\n1 dq0 ,s0 (Ek , Pk + q1 ) \u2264 2\u000f ; dq1 ,s1 (Ek , Pk + q2 ) \u2264 \u000f.\n\nLet us verify that (5.13) implies that dq1 , 12 s1 (Pk +q1 , Pk +q2 ) \u2264 12\u000f when \u000f is small, say, \u000f <\n\n1\n100 .\n\nIn\n\nfact, for each z \u2208 D(q1 , 21 s1 ) \u2229 (Pk + q1 ), we have d(z, Ek ) \u2264 dq0 ,s0 (Ek , Pk + q1 ) \u2264 \u000f, hence there exists\ny \u2208 Ek such that d(z, y) \u2264 \u000f. But since z \u2208 D(q1 , 12 s1 ), we have y \u2208 D(q1 , 21 s1 + \u000f) \u2282 D(q1 , s1 ), and\nhence d(y, Pk + q2 ) \u2264 s\u22121\n1 dq1 ,s1 (Ek , Pk + q2 ) \u2264 2\u000f, therefore d(z, Pk + q2 ) \u2264 d(z, y) + d(y, Pk + q2 ) \u2264 3\u000f.\nOn the other hand, suppose z \u2208 D(q1 , 12 s1 ) \u2229 (Pk + q2 ), we have d(z, Ek ) \u2264 s\u22121\n1 dq1 ,s1 (Pk +\nq2 , Ek ) \u2264 2\u000f, hence there exists y \u2208 Ek such that d(z, y) \u2264 2\u000f. But since z \u2208 D(q1 , 12 s1 ), we have\ny \u2208 D(q1 , 12 s1 + 2\u000f) \u2282 D(q0 , s0 ), and hence d(y, Pk + q1 ) \u2264 dq0 ,s0 (Ek , Pk + q1 ) \u2264 \u000f, which implies\nd(z, Pk + q1 ) \u2264 d(z, y) + d(y, Pk + q1 ) \u2264 3\u000f.\nAs a result\n(5.14)\n\n1\ndq1 , 12 s1 (Pk + q1 , Pk + q2 ) \u2264 ( s1 )\u22121 \u00d7 3\u000f = 12\u000f,\n2\n\nhence dq1 , 21 s1 (q1 , q2 ) \u2264 24\u000f, and therefore d(q1 , q2 ) \u2264 6\u000f = 12\u000fs1 .\nNow we define our iteration process (notice that it depends on \u000f, so we also call it a \u000f-process).\nSuppose that all {qi }i\u2264n have already been defined, with\n(5.15)\n\nd(qi , qi+1 ) \u2264 12si \u000f = 12 \u00d7 2\u2212i \u000f\n\nfor 0 \u2264 i \u2264 n \u2212 1, and hence\n(5.16)\n\nd(qi , qj ) \u2264 24\u000fsmin(i,j) = 2\u2212 min(i,j) \u00d7 24\u000f\n\nfor 0 \u2264 i, j \u2264 n, moreover for all i \u2264 n \u2212 1, Ek is \u000fsi near Pk + qi+1 in D(qi , si ). We say that the\nprocess does not stop at step n. In this case\nStep n+1 : We look at the situation in D(qn , sn ).\nIf Ek is not \u000f near any Pk +q in this ball of radius sn , we stop, since we have found the ok = qn , rk =\nsn as desired. In fact, since d(qn\u22121 , qn ) \u2264 12\u000fsn\u22121 , we have D(qn , 2sn (1 \u2212 12\u000f)) = D(qn , sn\u22121 (1 \u2212\n\n37\n\n\f12\u000f)) \u2282 D(qn\u22121 , sn\u22121 ), and hence\n(5.17)\n\ndqn ,2sn (1\u221212\u000f) (Pk + qn , Ek ) \u2264 (1 \u2212 12\u000f)\u22121 dqn\u22121 ,sn\u22121 (Pk + qn , Ek )\n\u000f\n\u2264\n.\n1 \u2212 12\u000f\n\nMoreover\nd(ok , O) = d(qn , q1 ) \u2264 2\u2212 min(1,n) \u00d7 24\u000f = 12\u000f.\n\n(5.18)\n\nOtherwise, we can find a qn+1 \u2208 R4 such that Ek is still \u000fsn near Pk + qn+1 in D(qn , sn ). Then\nsince \u000f is small, qn+1 \u2208 D(qn , 21 sn ). Moreover we have as before d(qn+1 , qn ) \u2264 12\u000fsn , and for i \u2264 n \u2212 1,\n(5.19)\n\nd(qi , qn+1 ) \u2264\n\nn\nX\n\nd(qj , qj+1 ) \u2264\n\nj=i\n\nn\nX\n\n12 \u00d7 2\u2212j \u000f \u2264 2\u2212j \u00d7 24\u000f = 2\u2212 min(i,n+1) \u00d7 24\u000f.\n\nj=i\n\nThus we have obtained our qn+1 .\nNow all we have to do is to prove that for every \u000f small enough, this process has to stop at a finite\nstep. For this purpose, we are going to estimate the measure of Ek . So we need the lemma below.\nLemma 5.20. There exists \u000f0 > 0, such that for all \u000f < \u000f0 , k large enough, and for every n such that\nthe \u000f\u2212process does not stop before n (which means in particular that there exists qn \u2208 B(qn\u22121 , 21 sn\u22121 )\nsuch that Ek is \u000fsn\u22121 near Pk + qn in D(qn\u22121 , sn\u22121 )),\nEk \u2229 (D(0, 1)\\D(qn , sn )) = Fn1 \u222a Fn2\n\n(5.21)\n\nwhere Fn1 , Fn2 do not meet each other. Moreover\nPki \u2229 (D(0, 1)\\D(qn , sn )) \u2282 pik (Fni )\n\n(5.22)\n\nwhere pik is the orthogonal projection on Pki , i = 1, 2.\nWe will prove a more general version of this lemma in the next section (Proposition 6.1 (2)). So\nlet us admit it for the moment.\nSince H 2 (Ek ) < 2\u03c0, there exists nk > 0 such that\ninf H 2 (Pk \\D(q, snk )) > H 2 (Ek ).\n\n(5.23)\n\nq\u2208R4\n\nThen our process has to stop before step nk , because otherwise by the above lemma, we have the\ndisjoint decomposition\n(5.24)\n\nEk = [Ek \u2229 D(qnk , snk )] ] Fn1k ] Fn2k ,\n\nand hence\n(5.25)\n\nH 2 (Ek ) \u2265 H 2 (Fn1k ) + H 2 (Fn2k ) \u2265 H 2 [p1k (Fn1k )] + H 2 [p2k (Fn2k )]\n\u2265 H 2 (Pk \\D(qnk , snk ) > H 2 (Ek ).\n2\n\nThis is impossible.\n\n38\n\n\f6\n\nProjection properties and regularity of Ek\n\nAs we have said in the previous section, the next step is to give some useful properties of Ek , including\nthe regularity for the flat part of Ek out of the small critical ball, and the surjectivity of the projections\nof Ek inside the ball. This is the main aim of this section. It gives also the proof of Lemma 5.20.\nWe are sorry that the proof for (3) and (4) of Proposition 6.1 is surprisingly painful. We have to\nderive the property from the geometric construction of the proof for Theorem 4.1, which is already\ncomplicated. But we did not find any easier proof.\nSo let us first state the main proposition that we will prove in this section.\nProposition 6.1. There exists \u000f0 > 0, such that for all \u000f < \u000f0 and k large, if the \u000f\u2212process does not\nstop before the step n, then\n39\n1\n(1) Ek \u2229 (Dk (0, 40\n)\\Dk (qn , 10\nsn )) is composed of two disjoint pieces Gi , i = 1, 2, such that:\n\nGi is the graph of a C 1 map g i : Dk (0,\n\n(6.2)\n\n39\n1\n\u22a5\n)\\Dk (qn , sn ) \u2229 Pki \u2192 Pki\n40\n10\n\nwith\n||\u2207g i ||\u221e < 1;\n\n(6.3)\n\n(2)(A more general version of Lemma 5.20) for every\n\n1\n10 sn\n\n\u2264 t \u2264 sn ,\n\nEk \u2229 (Dk (0, 1)\\Dk (qn , t)) = G1t \u222a G2t\n\n(6.4)\n\nwhere G1t , G2t do not meet each other.

First we give some useful\nnotations below.\nG(n, d) is the Grassmann manifold G(Rn , d);\n\n39\n\n\ffor every T \u2208 G(n, d), we denote by \u03c0T the orthogonal projection on the d-plane represented by\nT;\nfor every measure \u03bd on Rn , \u03b8d (\u03bd, x) = limr\u21920\n\n\u03bdB(a,r)\n\u03b1(d)r d\n\n(if the limit exists) is the density of \u03bd on x,\n\nwhere \u03b1(d) denote the volume of the d-dimensional unit ball;\nVd (Rn ) denote the set of all d\u2212varifold in Rn , i.e. all Radon measures on Gd (Rn ) = Rn \u00d7 G(n, d);\nfor each V \u2208 Vd (Rn ), ||V || is the Radon measure on Rn such that for each A \u2282 Rn , ||V ||(A) =\nV (Gd (Rn ) \u2229 {(x, S) : x \u2208 A});\n\u03b4(V ) denotes the first variation of V , that is, the linear map from X(Rn ) to R, defined by\nZ\n(6.7)\n\u03b4V (g) = Dg(x) * \u03c0S dV (x, S)\nfor g \u2208 X(Rn ). Here X(Rn ) is the vector space of all C \u221e maps from Rn to Rn with compact support.\nIn our case, we are only interested in rectifiable varifolds. In fact, with each d\u2212rectifiable set E\nwe associate a d\u2212varifold, denoted by VE , in the following sense : for each B \u2282 Rn \u00d7 G(n, d), we have\nVE (B) = H d {x : (x, Tx E) \u2208 B}.\n\n(6.8)\n\nRecall that Tx E is the d-dimensional tangent plane of E at x, it exists for almost all x \u2208 E, because E\nis d\u2212rectifiable. Then ||VE || = H d |E . Moreover, the density \u03b8d (||VE ||, x) exists for almost all x \u2208 E.\nTheorem 6.9 (c.f.[1] Regularity theorem at the beginning of section 8). Suppose 2 \u2264 d < p < \u221e,\nq=\n\np\np\u22121 .\n\nCorresponding to every \u000f with 0 < \u000f < 1 there is \u03b7 > 0 with the following property:\n\nSuppose 0 < R < \u221e, 0 < \u03bc < \u221e, V \u2208 Vd (Rn ), a \u2208 spt||V || and\n1) \u03b8d (||V ||, x) \u2265 \u03bc for ||V || almost all x \u2208 B(a, R);\n2) ||V ||B(a, R) \u2264 (1 + \u03b7)\u03bc\u03b1(d)Rd ;\nR\nd\n1\n1\n3) \u03b4V (g) \u2264 \u03b7\u03bc p R p\u22121 ( |g|q \u03bc||V ||) q whenever g \u2208 X(Rn ) and spt g \u2282 B(a, R).\nThen there are T \u2208 G(n, d) and a continuously differentiable function F : T \u2192 Rn , such that\n\u03c0T \u25e6 F = 1T ,\n(6.10)\n\nd\n\n||DF (y) \u2212 DF (z)|| \u2264 \u000f(|y \u2212 z|/R)1\u2212 p whenever y, z \u2208 T,\n\nand\n(6.11)\n\nB(a, (1 \u2212 \u000f)R) \u2229 spt||V || = B(a, (1 \u2212 \u000f)R) \u2229 image F.\n\nRemark 6.12. 1) In the theorem, since \u03c0T \u25e6 F = 1T , we can see that F is in fact the graph of a C 1\nfunction f , defined by f (t) = \u03c0T \u22a5 F (t), with t \u2208 T , \u03c0T \u22a5 the orthogonal projection on the orthogonal\nspace T \u22a5 of T . Moreover ||Df (t)|| \u2264 ||DF (t)|| for all t \u2208 T .\n2) If E is a locally minimal set, then VE is stationary, i.e. \u03b4VE = 0. Hence the condition 3) is\nautomatically true. In fact if we set gt (x) = (1 \u2212 t)x + tg(x), then\n(6.13)\n\n\u03b4VE (g) =\n\nd d\nH (gt (E \u2229 sptg)),\ndt\n40\n\n\fwhich can be deduced from the area formula. Thus if E is minimal, \u03b4VE = 0.\nProposition 6.14. For all n > d > 0, there exists \u000f1 = \u000f1 (n, d) > 0 such that the following is true.\nLet E be a locally minimal set of dimension d in an open set U \u2282 Rn , with U \u2283 B(0, 2) and 0 \u2208 E.\nThen if E is \u000f1 near a d\u2212plane P in B(0, 1), then E coincides with the graph of a C 1 map f : P \u2192 P \u22a5\nin B(0, 34 ). Moreover ||\u2207f ||\u221e < 1.\nProof. We will prove it only for d = 2. Proofs for other dimensions are similar.\nFirst let us verify the conditions in Theorem 6.9, with a = 0, R = 1, \u03bc = 1, \u03b7 <\n\n1\n10 ,\n\nand \u000f small, to\n\nchoose later.\n1) Since E is minimal, for each x \u2208 E, the density of E at x is at least 1, hence 1) is true.\n2) We know that E is \u000f1 near a 2-dimensional affine plane P in B(0, 1), and H 2 (P \u2229 B(0, 1)) \u2264\n\u03b1(2) = \u03c0. Then by Lemma 16.43 in [5], we can choose \u000f1 (which depends on \u000f, since \u03b7 depends on \u000f)\nsuch that 2) is true. In particular\nH 2 (B(0, 1) \u2229 E) \u2264\n\n(6.15)\n\n11\n\u03c0.\n10\n\n3) comes from the minimality of E, by Remark 6.12 2), with any p > 2.\nThen when p is sufficiently large, by Theorem 6.9, there exists a plane T and a C 1 map F from T\nto R4 such that in B(0, 1 \u2212 \u000f), E coincides with the image of F , and\n(6.16)\n\n2\n2\n7\n||DF (y) \u2212 DF (z)|| \u2264 \u000f(|y \u2212 z|/R)1\u2212 p \u2264 ( )1\u2212 p \u000f \u2264 2\u000f\n4\n\nfor all y, z \u2208 F \u22121 (E \u2229 B(0, 1 \u2212 \u000f)).\nNotice that for each y \u2208 F \u22121 (E \u2229 B(0, 1 \u2212 \u000f)) \u2282 T , DF (y)(T ) is the tangent plane of E at F (y).\nThus (6.16) means that the tangent planes of E do not vary a lot in B(0, 1 \u2212 \u000f).\nNow denote by Q the plane parallel to P (the plane in the statement of Proposition 6.14) and\npassing by the origin, \u03c0 the projection on Q, and \u03c0 0 the projection on Q\u22a5 . We claim that for each\ny \u2208 T such that F (y) \u2208 B(0, 1 \u2212 \u000f) and each u \u2208 Ty E = DF (y)(T ),\n(6.17)\n\n||\u03c0(u)|| \u2265\n\n3\n||u||.\n4\n\nIn fact, if (6.17) is not true, then there exists y \u2208 F \u22121 (E \u2229 B(0, 1 \u2212 \u000f)) and u \u2208 Ty E such that\n||\u03c0(u)|| < 43 ||u||.

Contradiction.\nSo we have (6.17). In other words, D\u03c0 is always injective in E \u2229 B(0, 1 \u2212 \u000f). Then by the implicit\nfunction theorem, for all x \u2208 E \u2229 B(0, 1 \u2212 \u000f), there exists rx > 0 and gx : Q \u2192 Q\u22a5 such that in\n\u03c0 \u22121 [B(\u03c0(x), rx ) \u2229 Q] \u2229 B(x, 2rx ), E coincides with the graph of gx on B(\u03c0(x), rx ). Moreover by (6.17)\n||\u2207gx (x)|| \u2264 1.\n\n(6.26)\nNext let us verify that\n\n3\n\u03c0(E \u2229 B(0, 1 \u2212 \u000f)) \u2283 Q \u2229 B(0, ).\n4\n\n(6.27)\n\nRecall that E is \u000f1 near a plane P parallel to Q in B(0, 1), hence E \u2229 B(0, 1) \u2282 B(P, \u000f1 ) and\nd(0, P ) \u2264 \u000f1 , therefore d(Q, P ) \u2264 \u000f1 . Hence E \u2229 B(0, 1 \u2212 \u000f) \u2282 B(Q, 2\u000f1 ), such that E \u2229 \u2202B(0, 1 \u2212 \u000f)) \u2282\nB(Q, 2\u000f), and therefore\n(6.28)\n\nfor every x \u2208 E \u2229 \u2202B(0, 1 \u2212 \u000f)), ||\u03c0(x)|| \u2265\n\np\n3\n(1 \u2212 \u000f)2 \u2212 (2\u000f)2 \u2265 .\n4\n\nBut by Theorem 6.9, E \u2229 B(0, 1 \u2212 \u000f) is a topological disc, hence by a topological argument similar\nto that of Lemma 4.9, (6.28) gives \u03c0(E \u2229 B(0, 1 \u2212 \u000f)) \u2283 B(0, 34 ) \u2229 Q. Thus we have (6.27).\nNow let \u0393 be a connected component of F := E \u2229 B(0, 1 \u2212 \u000f) \u2229 \u03c0 \u22121 (B(0, 34 ) \u2229 Q). Then it is both\nopen and closed in F . But we know that D\u03c0(x) is injective for all x \u2208 F , so \u03c0 is an open map, such\nthat \u03c0(\u0393) is open in B(0, 43 ) \u2229 Q. On the other hand, we claim that \u03c0(\u0393) is also closed in B(0, 43 ) \u2229 Q.\nIn fact, suppose that {xn } \u2282 \u03c0(\u0393) is a sequence of points that converge to a point x\u221e \u2208 B(0, 43 ) \u2229 Q.\nFor each n, take yn \u2208 \u0393 such that \u03c0(yn ) = xn . Then {yn } \u2282 \u0393, which is compact, hence the sequence\n{yn } admits a limit point y\u221e \u2282 \u0393. Therefore we have \u03c0(y\u221e ) = x\u221e . We want to prove that y\u221e \u2208 \u0393,\nhence we look at \u0393\\\u0393. Since \u0393 is closed in F = E \u2229 B(0, 1 \u2212 \u000f) \u2229 \u03c0 \u22121 (B(0, 43 ) \u2229 Q),\n3\n\u0393\\\u0393 \u2282 E \u2229 \u2202[B(0, 1 \u2212 \u000f) \u2229 \u03c0 \u22121 (B(0, ) \u2229 Q)]\n4\n(6.29)\n3\n3\n\u22121\n= E \u2229 {[\u2202B(0, 1 \u2212 \u000f) \u2229 \u03c0 (B(0, ) \u2229 Q)] \u222a [\u2202(\u03c0 \u22121 (B(0, ) \u2229 Q)) \u2229 B(0, 1 \u2212 \u000f)]}.\n4\n4\nq\nq\n7\nWe know that the distance d(\u2202B(0, 1 \u2212 \u000f) \u2229 \u03c0 \u22121 (B(0, 34 ) \u2229 Q), Q) > (1 \u2212 \u000f)2 \u2212 ( 34 )2 > 16\n\u2212 2\u000f,\nand d(P, Q) \u2264 d(0, P ) < \u000f1 , since 0 \u2208 Q and 0 \u2208 E.

Then the hypothesis says that for each y \u2208 E \u2229 B(0, 1), d(y, P ) < \u000f1 ,\nhence [E \u2229 B(0, 1)] \u2229 \u2202B(0, 1 \u2212 \u000f) \u2229 \u03c0 \u22121 (B(0, 34 ) \u2229 Q) = \u2205.

As a result, \u03c0(\u0393) = B(0, 34 ) \u2229 Q.\nNow we claim that\n3\n3\n\u03c0 : \u0393 \u2192 B(0, ) \u2229 Q is a covering space of Q \u2229 B(0, ).\n4\n4\n\n(6.32)\n\nIn fact, since E is compact, the continuous map \u03c0 : E \u2192 Q is proper, such that for each x \u2208 Q\u2229B(0, 43 ),\n\u03c0 \u22121 (x) \u2229 \u0393 is a finite set. Denote this set {y1 , * * * , yN }. Then by the conclusion before (6.26), for each\n1 \u2264 j \u2264 N , there exists rj > 0 such that in \u03c0 \u22121 [B(x, rj ) \u2229 Q] \u2229 B(yj , 2rj ), \u0393 coincides with the graph\nof a map gj : Q \u2192 Q\u22a5 on B(x, rj ) \u2229 Q.

On the other hand, for each y \u2208 \u03c0 \u22121 (B(x, r) \u2229 Q),\ntake a connected component \u03b3 of \u03c0 \u22121 (B(x, r) \u2229 Q) such that y \u2208 \u03b3, then by an argument similar to\nthe one for \u0393 on B(0, 43 ) \u2229 Q above, \u03c0(\u03b3) \u2283 B(x, r) \u2229 Q , in particular, there exists 1 \u2264 j \u2264 N such\nthat yj \u2208 \u03b3. But in this case we have \u03b3 = gj (B(x, r) \u2229 Q), hence y \u2208 gj (B(x, r) \u2229 Q). As a result,\n\u03c0 \u22121 [B(x, r) \u2229 Q] is just a finite disjoint union of gj (B(x, r) \u2229 Q), 1 \u2264 j \u2264 N , and on each of theses\npieces, \u03c0 is an homeomorphism of B(x, r), where (6.32) follows.\nBut Q \u2229 B(0, 43 ) is simply connected, \u0393 is its connected covering space by \u03c0, hence \u03c0 has to be a\nhomeomorphism. Then by the conclusion around (6.26), \u0393 is the graph of a C 1 map from Q to Q\u22a5\nwhose gradient is of L\u221e norm less than 1. In particular, the measure of \u0393 is larger than the measure\nof B(0, 34 ) \u2229 Q, which is\n\n9\n16 \u03c0.\n\nNow denote by \u03931 , * * * , \u0393n , * * * all the connected components of F = E \u2229 B(0, 1 \u2212 \u000f) \u2229 \u03c0 \u22121 (B(0, 34 ) \u2229\nQ), the measure of each \u0393i is larger than\n(6.33)\n\n9\n16 \u03c0.\n\nThen if there exists more than one \u0393i , we have\n\n9\n9\n3\nH 2 (E \u2229 B(0, 1)) > H 2 (E \u2229 B(0, 1 \u2212 \u000f) \u2229 \u03c0 \u22121 (B(0, ) \u2229 Q)) \u2265 2 \u00d7 \u03c0 = \u03c0,\n4\n16\n8\n\nwhich contradicts (6.15).\nThus E \u2229 B(0, 1 \u2212 \u000f) \u2229 \u03c0 \u22121 (B(0, 43 ) \u2229 Q) is a trivial covering space of Q \u2229 B(0, 34 ). Combine\nwith (6.27), \u03c0 \u22121 : B(0, 34 ) \u2229 Q \u2192 E \u2229 B(0, 1 \u2212 \u000f) \u2229 \u03c0 \u22121 (B(0, 34 )) is a C 1 map, which coincides with\ngx around \u03c0(x) for each x \u2208 E \u2229 B(0, 1 \u2212 \u000f) \u2229 \u03c0 \u22121 (B(0, 43 )), and hence ||\u2207g||\u221e < 1. Now set\nf = g \u25e6 \u03c0 : P \u2229 \u03c0 \u22121 (B(0, 34 ) \u2192 E \u2229 B(0, 1 \u2212 \u000f) \u2229 \u03c0 \u22121 (B(0, 43 )). Thus since P is parallel to Q, we get\n2\n\nthe desired conclusion.\n\nRemark 6.34. For d = 2, n = 4, we can also get the same result by Theorem 1.15 of [6], without all\nthose complicated concepts such as varifolds, etc.\nCorollary 6.35. There exists \u000f1 > 0 such that if k is large enough, E is a locally minimal sets in a\ndomain U \u2282 R4 , Dk (0, 1) \u2282 U , and E is \u000f1 near a plane P in Dk (0, 1), then in Dk (0, 12 ), E coincides\nwith the graph of a C 1 map f : P \u2192 P \u22a5 . Moreover ||\u2207f ||\u221e < 1.\n44\n\n\fProof. When k is large enough, we have Dk (0, 12 ) \u2282 B(0, 34 ) \u2282 B(0, 1) \u2282 Dk (0, 1). Then if E is \u000f1\nnear a plane P in Dk (0, 1), this implies that E is \u000f1 near P in B(0, 1). Thus by Proposition 6.14, in\nB(0, 43 ), E is the graph of a C 1 map C 1 f : P \u2192 P \u22a5 , with ||f ||\u221e < 1. Therefore in Dk (0, 21 ), too.\n2\nNow fix a large enough k, and denote by D(x, r) = Dk (x, r), C i (x, r) = Cki (x, r) for i = 1, 2, and\ndx,r = dkx,r .\nProof of (1) of Proposition 6.1.\nSince k is large, Pk is very near P0 , there exists 0 < \u000f3 <\n\n1\n100\n\n(which does not depend on k for k\n\n4\n\nlarge), such that for all \u000f < \u000f3 , if x \u2208 R and E is any set such that dx,r (E, Pk + q) < \u000f, with q \u2208 R4\n1\nand d(x, q) < 20\u000fr, then in D(x, r)\\D(q, 100\nr), E is the disjoint union of two pieces E 1 , E 2 , such that\n\nin D(x, r) minus a small hole, E 1 is near Pk1 + q, but far from Pk2 + q, and vice-versa for E 2 .

In fact all we want is 4), i.e.,\nthe surjectivity of the projections, to estimate the measure of Ek for the part where we do not know\nmuch about its structure. Notice that by the proof of Theorem 4.1, we know that Ek is the limit of a\nsequence {Hl } of deformations of Pk in U = R4 \\[Pk \\B(0, 1)]. Hence in E the projection pik of Ek is\nautomatically surjective on D(0, 1) \u2229 Pki . Next we look into D(0, 12 ), since Ek is near Pk , the part of\nEk \\D(0, 12 ) which is near Pk1 has no projection in D(0, 21 ) \u2229 Pk1 , and the part of Ek \\D(0, 12 ) which is\nnear Pk2 has a very small projection on Pk1 , and this projection is very near the origin, hence we can\n1\nsay that outside a small ball, say D(0, 100\n), the projection p1k from Ek \u2229 D(0, 12 ) to Pk1 is surjective\n1\n1\n). However in D(0, 100\n), we can not say directly that the projection of Ek\non Pk1 \u2229 D(0, 12 )\\D(0, 100\n\ncomes from Ek \u2229 D(0, 12 ), because part of it may come from the part near Pk2 . (Picture 6-1 below may\ngive an idea).\n\n6-1\nTherefore the idea to prove 4) is still to prove that Ek \u2229 D(0, 12 ) is the limit of a sequence of\ndeformations of Pk \u2229 D(0, 12 ). In other words, we can contract the part outside D(0, 12 ) into D(0, 12 ).\nThis part is very flat and regular, hence intuitively such a contraction will not change essentially the\nstructure of Ek in D(0, 12 ).\nHere we still have to say, if Ek is itself a deformation of Pk and is very near Pk , then we can easily\ncontract the part Ek \\D(0, 21 ) to Ek \u2229 \u2202D(0, 21 ), just like we contract an annulus to the interior circle,\n49\n\n\fbecause Ek \\D(0, 12 ) is roughly composed of two pieces of C 1 graph on Pki \\D(0, 21 ), thanks to (6.2).\nThen next we can carry on the same operation in D(0, 12 ), if Ek is still near some translation of Pk\nin D(0, 12 ). At last, we will arrive at the scale where the \u000f\u2212process stops. Hence we can say that\nEk \u2229 D(qn , t) is a deformation of Pk , too, because it is a deformation of Ek .\nHowever Ek may not be a deformation of Pk . Hence we will use the fact that Ek is the limit of a\nsequence of deformations {Hl }, and we want to apply the argument above to prove that Hl \u2229 D(0, 12 )\nis a deformation of Pk \u2229 D(0, 12 ). But this time, Hl is not minimal, hence we cannot use (6.2) to say\nthat Hl \u2229 \u2202D(0, 21 ) is a very regular curve, and therefore it is not that easy to manage to contract Hl\ndirectly on Hl \u2229 \u2202D(0, 12 ).\nThen what we are going to do is, first use the shortest distance projection \u03c0 to project Hl on\nD(0, 21 ). Then the points of Hl \\D(0, 12 ) are sent by \u03c0 to \u2202D(0, 21 ) (but the image is not Hl \u2229 \u2202D(0, 12 )\nanymore). To continue to project \u03c0(Hl )\\D(q2 , 41 ) in D(q2 , 14 ), we use the fact that \u03c0(Hl )\\D(q2 , 41 )\nis composed of two disjoint pieces near Pk1 + q2 and Pk2 + q2 respectively. To guarantee this, by the\nargument before (6.36), \u03c0(Hl ) should be \u000f3 s2 = 12 \u000f3 near Pk + q2 . For the part inside D(0, 12 ), there\nis no problem, because the \u000f\u2212process does not stop here. However for the part on the boundary\n\u2202D(0, 12 ), things are complicated because this part contains the projection of the Hl \\D(0, 12 ), which is\n2\u000f3 s2 near pk + q2 , not \u000f3 s2 near it. But luckily we can manage first to do a contraction in \u2202D(0, 12 ),\nto contract everything near Pk + q2 , without moving points inside D(0, 12 ). Thus we make things more\ncomplicated, but at last we can still carry on with the proof.\nAfter all these, we can prove the surjectivity of projections of Ek \u2229 D(qn , t), since it is the limit of\na sequence of deformations.\nNow we begin to concretize the above idea.\nProof of (3) and (4) of Proposition 6.1. Fix a\n\n1\n10 sn\n\n\u2264 t \u2264 sn .\n\nWe know that for all j \u2264 n, in every D(qj\u22121 , sj\u22121 ), Ek is \u000fsj\u22121 near Pk + qj , because the \u000f\u2212process\ndoes not stop on step j. Then set Ek is the limit of Hl , hence we can suppose that l is large, so that in\nevery D(qj\u22121 , sj\u22121 ), Hl is 2\u000fsj\u22121 near Pk +qj , for all j \u2264 n. By definition of \u000f0 , we have 2\u000f < 2\u000f0 < \u000f3 ,\n1\nhence (6.36) and (6.37) give that in D(qj\u22121 , sj\u22121 )\\D(qj , 100\nsj\u22121 ), Hl is the union of two disjoint pieces\n\nHl1 , Hl2 with\n(6.65)\n\nHli \u2282 B(Pki + qj \u2229 D(qj\u22121 , sj\u22121 )\\D(qj ,\n\n1\nsj\u22121 ), 2\u000fr).\n100\n\nWe will construct our deformation Fln by recurrence on j < n.\nFor j = 1, define \u03c01 : Hl \u2192 D(q1 , s1 ) the shortest distance projection from R4 to D(q1 , s1 ). Notice\nthat although Hl \u2229 D(q1 , s1 ) is 2\u000fs1 near Pk1 + q2 in D(q1 , s1 ), \u03c01 (Hl \\D(q1 , s1 )) is not necessarily 2\u000fs1\nnear Pk1 + q2 in D(q1 , s1 ). Therefore we will modify it a little, to be able to continue decompose it\ninto two disjoint pieces that verify some conditions similar to (6.36)-(6.38).\n\n50\n\n\fBy (6.36), in D(0, 1)\\D(q1 , s1 ), Hl is the union of two disjoint pieces Hl1 , Hl2 , where Hli is very\nnear Pki , so we have\n(6.66)\n\n\u03c01 (Hli ) \u2229 D(0, 1)\\D(q1 , s1 )) \u2282 \u2202C i (q1 , s1 ) \u2229 B(Pki , 2\u000f).\n\nAs a result, the image by \u03c01 of each Hli outside D(q1 , s1 ) is contained in the cylinder C i (q1 , s1 ), and\nalso contained in a very small neighborhood of the plane Pki . I.e., it is contained in a 3-dimensional\nthin band around Pki \u2229 \u2202C i (q1 , s1 ). In particular, it is far from the boundary \u2202C j (q1 , s1 ) for i 6= j.\nTherefore we can define g1 on \u03c01 (Hl ) by\n(6.67)\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 x ; x \u2208 D(q , s ) ;\n1 1\ng1 (x) =\n\uf8f3 g i (x) ; x \u2208 \u2202C i (q1 , s1 ).\n1\n\nwhere g1i is the orthogonal projection on B(Pki + q2 , 2\u000fs1 ).\nIt is clear that for all points x \u2208 Hl \u2229 D(q1 , s1 ) \u2282 \u03c01 (Hl ), neither \u03c01 nor g1i can move it, since in\nD(q1 , s1 ) Hl is 2\u000fs1 near Pk1 + q2 . Hence the action of g1i is just to press all points on the boundary\n\u2202Cki (q1 , s1 ) into a 2s1 \u000f neighborhood of Pki , without leaving the boundary. Then g1 is 2-Lipschitz\n(locally 1-Lipschitz). Set h1 = g1 \u25e6 \u03c01 , then h1 is 2-Lipschitz, and moreover h1 (Hl ) \u2282 D(q1 , s1 ) is 2\u000fs1\nnear Pk . See Picture 6-2 and 6-3 below. 6-2 is the set, Hl , and in 6-3 we give the image of Hl after\nh1 .\n\n51\n\n\f6-2\n\n6-3\nNow we have defined h1 in D(0, 1) = D(q0 , s0 ), which deforms Hl into D(q1 , s1 ) and keeps the\nimage 2\u000fs1 near Pk + q2 . But h1 is 2-Lipschitz and is defined on a compact set Hl , hence we can\nextend it on the whole R4 . Still call the obtained function h1 . Then it is still 2-Lipschitz.\nNow suppose that for j, we have constructed a 2-Lipschitz deformation hj which deform Hl into\nD(qj , sj ) and whose image is 2\u000fsj near Pk + qj+1 in D(qj , sj ). If j < n \u2212 1, then we can define \u03c0j+1 the\nshortest distance projection to D(qj+1 , sj+1 ), and then similarly we project all point on the boundary\nof C i (qj+1 , sj+1 ) into the 2\u000fsj+1 neighborhood of Pki + qj+2 . Denote this projection by gj+1 , and set\nhj+1 = gj+1 \u25e6 \u03c0j+1 \u25e6 hj . Then hj+1 is a 2-Lipschitz deformation that maps Hl in D(qj+1 , sj+1 ) and\nits image is \u000fsj+1 near Pk + qj+2 in D(qj+1 , sj+1 ).Thus we obtain our hj+1 .\nTherefore by recursion, we can define the hj until hn\u22121 .\nNow for each l, we will define a deformation hn (l), which will deform Hl into D(qn , t + 1l ). Denote\ni\n\nby pn (l) the shortest distance projection on D(qn , t + 1l ), and for x \u2208 C (qn , t + 1l )\\C i (qn , t), set\ngni (l)(x) = (id, g i ) \u25e6 pik \u25e6 pn (l), where g i is as in (6.2). Then we define the deformation hn (l) of\n\n52\n\n\fPk \u2229 D(0, 1) as follows. For x \u2208 Pk \u2229 D(0, 1):\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2h\nhn\u22121 (x) \u2208 D(qn , t) ;\nn\u22121 (x),\n(6.68)\nhn (l)(x) =\n\uf8f3 sg i (l) \u25e6 hn\u22121 (x) + (1 \u2212 s)hn\u22121 (x), hn\u22121 (x) \u2208 \u2202C i (qn , t + 1 s).\nn\nl\nThen we can see that hn (l)(Pk ) \u2229 D(qn , t) = Hl \u2229 D(qn , t), and hn (l)(Pk ) \u2229 \u2202D(qn , t + 1l ) =\nEk \u2229 \u2202D(qn , t + 1l ). Between D(qn , t) and \u2202D(qn , t + 1l ) the image of hn (l) is the image of a homotopy\nbetween Hl and Ek . Then since Hl converges to Ek , Fln (t) = hn (l)(Pk ) converges to Ek \u2229 (qn , t) when\nl goes to infinity.\nDenote by al (t) the affine deformation which sends Pk \u2229 B(0, 1) to (Pk + qn ) \u2229 D(qn , t + 1l ), and\nset\nfln (t) = hn (l) \u25e6 al (t).\n\n(6.69)\n\nThen Fln (t) = fln (t)((Pk + qn ) \u2229 D(qn , t + 1l )) verifies all conditions in (3).\nThe condition (4) is an immediate corollary of (3). In fact we know that Fln (t) is a deformation\nof (Pk + qn ) \u2229 D(qn , t + 1l ) which sends \u2202C i (qn , t) in \u2202C i (qn , t), hence\n1\npik (Fln (t)) \u2283 Pki \u2229 Cki (qn , t + ).\nl\n\n(6.70)\n\nTherefore since Ek \u2229D(qn , t) is the limit of Fln (t), each projection pik is surjective from Ek \u2229D(qn , t)\n2\n\nto Pki \u2229 Cki (qn , t).\n\n7\n\nArgument of harmonic extension\n\nIn this section we will give some fundamental estimates on the measure of the graph of a C 1 function\non an almost concentric annulus. One can easily skip this section and admit these estimates, and\ncontinue the proof of Theorem 1.2 from the beginning of the next section.\nProposition 7.1.

Take all the notation at the beginning of this section.\nFix a k large, and denote by D(x, r) = Dk (x, r), C i (x, r) = Cki (x, r) for i = 1, 2, and dx,r = dkx,r .\nWe know that in D(ok , rk ), Ek is not \u000frk near any translation of Pk , so by Corollary 8.24, Ek is not\n\u03b4rk near any translation of Pk in D(ok , rk )\\D(ok , 14 rk ). However by (6.2), Ek \u2229D(ok , rk )\\D(ok , 41 rk ) =\n39\n1\n[G1 \u222a G2 ] \u2229 [D(ok , rk )\\D(ok , 14 rk )], where Gi is a C 1 graph of Pki \u2229 D(0, 40\n)\\D(ok , 10\nrk ). Hence there\n\nexists i \u2208 {1, 2} such that in D(ok , rk )\\D(ok , 14 rk ), Gi is not \u03b4rk near any translation of Pki . Without\nloss of generality, we can suppose this is the case for i = 1.\nThen denote by P = Pk1 for short, and let g 1 be as in (6.2); then g 1 is a map from P to P \u22a5 , and\nis therefore from R2 to R2 . Write g 1 = (\u03c61 , \u03c62 ), where \u03c6i : R2 \u2192 R. Then since the graph of g 1 is\n\u03b4rk far from all translation of P , there exists j \u2208 {1, 2} such that\n(8.27)\n\n|\u03c6j (x) \u2212 \u03c6j (y)| \u2265\n\nsup\nx,y\u2208P \u2229D(ok ,rk )\\D(ok , 41 rk )\n\n1\nrk \u03b4.\n2\n\nSuppose this is true for j = 1.

For each\nm \u2265 2 and n \u2265 2, there exists 0 < \u03b8 <\n\n\u03c0\n2,\n\nsuch that if P 1 , P 2 , * * * , P n are n planes of dimension m\n\nij\nin Rnm with characteristic angles \u03b1ij = (\u03b11ij , \u03b12ij , * * * , \u03b1m\n) between P i and P j , 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 n, which\nij\nverify \u03b8 < \u03b11ij \u2264 \u03b12ij \u2264 * * * \u2264 \u03b1m\n\u2264\n\n\u03c0\n2\n\nfor all 1 \u2264 i < j \u2264 n, then their union \u222ani=1 P i is a minimal\n\ncone.\n65\n\n\fTheorem 8.57 (minimality of the union of a plane and a Y set which are almost orthogonal). There\nexists 0 < \u03b8 <\n\n\u03c0\n2,\n\nsuch that if P and Q are two subspaces of R5 of dimension 2 and 3 respectively,\n\nwhich verify\n(8.58)\n\nfor all unit simple vectors u \u2208 P, v \u2208 Q, then the angle between u and v is larger than \u03b8,\n\nand if Y is a Y set in Q centered at the point of P \u2229 Q, then the union P \u222a Y is a minimal cone.\nThe general idea for the proofs of the two theorems are somehow similar to the proof of Theorem\n1.2. But there are also some non trivial modifications, especially for Theorem 8.57. See [13] for more\ndetail of the proofs. We could have continued to discuss one by one that if the almost orthogonal\nunions of other pairs or families of minimal cones are minimal. In fact Theorem 8.57 was the first try,\nwhere we replaced one plane by the simplest minimal cone Y. But then the author noticed that the\nproof became already a bit too complicated, so she stopped at this step.\n\nReferences\n[1] William K. Allard. On the first variation of a varifold.
