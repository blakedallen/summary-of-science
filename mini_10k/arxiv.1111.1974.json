The Morse potential one-dimensional quantum system is a realistic model for\nstudying vibrations of atoms in a diatomic molecule. This system is very close to the harmonic\noscillator one. We thus propose a construction of squeezed coherent states similar to the one\nof harmonic oscillator using ladder operators. Properties of these states are analysed with\nrespect to the localization in position, minimal Heisenberg uncertainty relation, the statistical\nproperties and illustrated with examples using the finite number of states in a well-known\ndiatomic molecule.\n\n1. Introduction\nCoherent and squeezed states are known to be very important in many fields of physics. Coherent\nstates were discovered in 1926 by Schr\u00f6dinger [1], while squeezed states were introduced by\nKennard in 1927 [2]. However, these works were, in the main, ignored or forgotten until the\nsixties, when these states became very popular and received a lot of attention from both fields,\nmathematics and physics. Among many important papers, let us mention the works of Glauber\n[3], Klauder [4, 5], and Nieto [6]. In the particular field of quantum optics, the books of Walls and\nMilburn [7], Gazeau [8] and Rand [9] are very good reading which also consider the applications.\nThe study of squeezed states for systems admitting an infinite discrete spectrum, obtained as\na generalisation of coherent states, has been recently the center of much attention (see, for\nexample, [10, 11, 12, 13, 14]).\nIn modern developments, coherent states (CS) are standardly defined in three equivalent ways:\ndisplacement operator method, ladder (annihilation) operator method and minimum uncertainty\nmethod (for review see for example [6]). Initially defined for the case of the harmonic oscillator,\ncoherent states have been generalised for other systems. We can use, for example, the definition\nof Klauder [15] saying that they are obtained as the following superposition of energy eigenstates\n{|\u03c8n i, n \u2208 N}\nX zn\n1\np\n\u03c8(z) = p\n|\u03c8n i.\n(1)\nN (|z|2 ) n\u2208I \u03c1(n)\n\n\fThe sum is taken over all the discrete values of n and the set I is usually infinite. The parameter\nz is a complex variable in general, N is a normalization factor and {\u03c1(n), n \u2208 N} is a set of\nstrictly positive parameters, usually depending on the energy of the system under consideration.\nThese last quantities correspond to a moment problem (see [15] for details).\nFor a quantum system which admits an infinite discrete spectrum {|\u03c8n i, n = 0, 1, ...} and\nladder operators A\u2212 and A+ acting on the energy eigenstates as\np\np\n(2)\nA\u2212 |\u03c8n i = k(n) |\u03c8n\u22121 i, A+ |\u03c8n i = k(n + 1) |\u03c8n+1 i,\nthese coherent states are defined as eigenstates of A\u2212 . We thus get [15]\n\u03c1(n) =\n\nn\nY\n\nk(i),\n\n\u03c1(0) = 1.\n\n(3)\n\ni=1\n\nNote that the quantity k(i) is not unique and can be chosen to impose additional constraints to\nthe ladder operators. In particular, for the harmonic oscillator, we have k(i) = i,\n[A\u2212 , A+ ] = I,\n\n1\nHho = ~\u03c9(A+ A\u2212 + ),\n2\n\n(4)\n\nand the expression (1) gives the usual coherent states.\nNow, for a quantum system which admits a finite discrete spectrum like the one which involves\nthe Morse potential, various constructions of coherent states have been adapted [16, 17, 18, 19].\nIn a recent paper [20], we have used ladder operators [21, 22] to construct different types of\ncoherent states of the Morse potential and have compared them with the so-called Gaussian\ncoherent states [23]. In particular, such a construction has been inspired by the approach\nmentioned above (see formula (1)) but where the set I of values of n is now finite. The coherent\nstates are not exactly eigenstates of the annihilation operator A\u2212 but we have shown [20] that, in\npractice, the last terms on the right hand side of the sum in (1) does not contribute significantly.\nIn some approaches (see, for example, [24]) these states are called pseudo-coherent states.\nTo our knowledge, squeezed coherent states for the Morse potential have not been constructed.\nThe aim of this paper is thus to show that such a construction can be closely related to the\none for infinite spectrum systems. In fact, these states would be almost eigenstates of a linear\ncombination of the ladder operators. Moreover, we demonstrate using numerical evaluations\nthat one set of these states, the energy-like, behave properly as squeezed states.\nIn Section 2 we give a review of relevant results on squeezed coherent states and minimal\nuncertainty relations for a quantum system with infinite spectrum. In Section 3, starting with\nthe definition of the Morse model and its ladder operators, we define the corresponding squeezed\ncoherent states. We thus get two types of the states called oscillator-like and energy-like. In\nSection 4, we show that the energy-like states have stable trajectories in the phase space and\nminimize the uncertainty relation. Due to the complexity of the expressions of those states,\nnumerical calculations are used. We end the paper with conclusions in Section 5.\n2. Squeezed coherent states for a quantum system with infinite spectrum\nAs in the case of harmonic oscillator, general squeezed coherent states [6], for a quantum system\nwith an infinite discrete energy spectrum, may be constructed as the solutions of the eigenvalue\nequation:\n(A\u2212 + \u03b3A+ )\u03c8(z, \u03b3) = z \u03c8(z, \u03b3), z, \u03b3 \u2208 C.\n(5)\nThe mixing of A\u2212 and A+ is said to be controlled by a squeezing parameter \u03b3 and z is called\nthe coherent parameter. The coherent states are special solutions when \u03b3 = 0. Conditions on \u03b3\nmust be imposed for the states to be normalisable.\n\n\fSqueezed coherent states (SCS) based on su(2) or su(1, 1) algebras [12, 13] and also direct\nsums of these algebras with the algebra h(2) [14], have been constructed using group theoretical\nmethods. This involves, in particular, the operators displacement D and squeezing S similar to\nthe ones of the harmonic oscillator. In fact, for su(2) or su(1, 1) algebras, k(n) is a quadratic\nfunction of n.\nMore generally, equation (5) may be solved by using a direct expansion of \u03c8(z, \u03b3) in the form\n\u03c8(z, \u03b3) = p\n\n\u221e\nX\nZ(z, \u03b3, n)\n1\np\n|\u03c8n i,\nNg (z, \u03b3) n=0\n\u03c1(n)\n\nwith\nNg (z, \u03b3) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n|Z(z, \u03b3, n)|2\nn=0\n\n\u03c1(n)\n\n,\n\n(6)\n\n(7)\n\nwhere \u03c1(n) is given by (3). Indeed, for the case \u03b3 6= 0, inserting (6) into (5), we get a 3-term\nrecurrence relation\nZ(z, \u03b3, n + 1) \u2212 z Z(z, \u03b3, n) + \u03b3 k(n) Z(z, \u03b3, n \u2212 1) = 0, n = 1, 2, ...\n\n(8)\n\nand without restriction, we take Z(z, \u03b3, 0) = 1 and thus Z(z, \u03b3, 1) = z.\nFor the harmonic oscillator, \u03c1(n) = n! and we get explicitly [14, 25]:\nn\n\nZho (z, \u03b3, n) =\n\n[2]\nX\ni=0\n\n\u0013\n\u0010 \u03b3 \u0011i\n\u0010\u03b3 \u0011n \u0012\nz\nn!\n2\nH n, \u221a\n\u2212\n.\nz (n\u22122i) =\ni!(n \u2212 2i)!\n2\n2\n2\u03b3\n\n(9)\n\nIt is well-known that |\u03b3| < 1 for the states to be normalizable in this case. In (9), we see that the\nHermite polynomials H(n, w) take values on C. These polynomials have interesting properties\nin terms of orthogonality, measure and resolution of the identity [26].\nFor the harmonic oscillator, these states minimize the Schr\u00f6dinger-Robertson uncertainty\nrelation [27] which becomes the usual Heisenberg uncertainty relation for \u03b3 real. Indeed, we get\n(\u2206x\u0302)2 =\n\n1\n1\n1\n1\n\u2212 , (\u2206p\u0302)2 =\n\u2212\n1+\u03b3 2\n1\u2212\u03b3 2\n\n(10)\n\nand the uncertainty becomes\n1\n\u2206(z, \u03b3) = (\u2206x\u0302)2 (\u2206p\u0302)2 = .\n(11)\n4\nWe see that this implies the reduction of the \"quantum noise\" on one of the observables while\nincreasing it on the other. In the following we will treat the case when the quantum noise is\nreduced on the observable x because we want a good localisation in the position.\n3. The Morse potential and different types of squeezed coherent states\nThe Morse potential quantum system is a realistic model for studying vibrations of atoms in\na diatomic molecule. Since this system is very close to the harmonic oscillator, the squeezed\ncoherent states will be constructed following the procedure given for the harmonic oscillator,\nbut we will deal with a finite number of eigenstates.\n\n\f3.1. The model\nThe one-dimensional Morse model is given by the energy eigenvalue equation (see, for example,\n[21])\n\u0012 2\n\u0013\np\u0302\n\u0124 \u03c8(x) =\n+ VM (x) \u03c8(x) = E\u03c8(x),\n(12)\n2mr\nwhere mr is the reduced mass of the oscillating system composed of two atoms of masses m1\nand m2 , i.e. m1r = m11 + m12 . The potential is VM (x) = V0 (e\u22122\u03b2x \u2212 2e\u2212\u03b2x ), where the space\nvariable x represents the displacement of the two atoms from their equilibrium positions, V0 is\na scaling energy constant representing the depth of the potential well at equilibrium x = 0 and\n\u03b2 is the parameter of the model (related to the characteristics of the well, such as its depth and\nwidth).\nThe finite discrete spectrum is known as\nEn = \u2212\n\n~2 2 2\n\u03b2 \u000fn ,\n2mr\n\nwhere\n\u03bd\u22121\n\u000fn =\n\u2212 n = p \u2212 n,\n2\n\ns\n\u03bd=\n\nand {n = 0, 1, 2, ..., [p]}, with [p] the integer part of p =\ne(n) =\n\n(13)\n\n8mr V0\n,\n~2 \u03b2 2\n\n\u03bd\u22121\n2 .\n\n(14)\n\nThe following shifted energies\n\n2mr\n(En \u2212 E0 ) = \u000f20 \u2212 \u000f2n = n(2p \u2212 n)\n~2 \u03b2 2\n\n(15)\n\nare useful for the construction of squeezed coherent states. Using the change of variable\ny = \u03bde\u2212\u03b2x , we get the energy eigenfunctions, for the discrete spectrum, in terms of associated\nn\nLaguerre polynomials, denoted by L2\u000f\nn , as\ny\n\nn\n\u03c8n\u03bd (x) = Nn e\u2212 2 y \u000fn L2\u000f\nn (y),\n\n(16)\n\nwhere Nn is a normalization factor given by\ns\ns\n\u03b2(\u03bd \u2212 2n \u2212 1)\u0393(n + 1)\n2\u03b2(p \u2212 n)\u0393(n + 1)\nNn =\n=\n.\n\u0393(\u03bd \u2212 n)\n\u0393(2p \u2212 n + 1)\n\n(17)\n\nSince p is related to physical parameters (see (14)), it is not an integer in practice and N is\nnever zero as expected.\nFor many applications, it is convenient to introduce the number operator N\u0302 such that\nN\u0302 \u03c8n\u03bd (x) = n \u03c8n\u03bd (x)\n\n(18)\n2\n\n~\nand we see from (13) that \u0124 can be in fact written as \u0124 = \u2212 2m\n\u03b2 2 (p \u2212 N\u0302 )2 .\nr\n\n3.2. Ladder operators\nThe ladder operators of the Morse system are defined as in (2), however the set of eigenfunctions\n{|\u03c8n i} is finite. As mentioned in the introduction, the quantity k(n) in (2) is not unique and we\nconsider two natural choices [20]. The first choice, the \"oscillator-like\", corresponds to k(n) = n.\nThe ladder operators satisfy a h(2) algebra. The second choice, the \"energy-like\", corresponds\nto k(n) = e(n), as given in (15). Ladder operators satisfy a su(1, 1) algebra. In what follows,\nthe subscripts o and e will be used to refer to these choices.\n\n\fThough our future calculations do not need the explicit form of the ladder operators, we give\nthem for completeness [19, 21, 28, 29]. For example, we get [21]:\nd\n(\u03bd \u2212 2N \u2212 1)(\u03bd \u2212 2N ) \u03bd p\n(19)\nA\u2212 = \u2212[ (\u03bd \u2212 2N ) \u2212\n+ ] K(N ),\ndy\n2y\n2\np\nd\n(\u03bd \u2212 2N \u2212 1)(\u03bd \u2212 2N \u2212 2) \u03bd\nA+ = ( K(N ))\u22121 [ (\u03bd \u2212 2N \u2212 2) +\n\u2212 ],\n(20)\ndy\n2y\n2\nwhere K(n) is related to k(n) by\nn(\u03bd \u2212 n)(\u03bd \u2212 2n \u2212 1)\nK(n).\n(21)\n\u03bd \u2212 2n + 1\nThese relations are valid for any integer n in the interval [0, [p]\u22121]. Note that, for n = [p], we get a\n\u03bd (x) of the Morse potential but the action of the creation operators\npermitted energy eigenstate \u03c8[p]\non this state does not give zero in general. It gives a state which may not be normalisable with\nrespect to our scalar product. This problem has been already mentioned in some contributions\n(see, for example, [21, 28]). For arbitrary\np, the special choice k(n) = n([p] + 1 \u2212 n), leads to\np\n\u03bd\n\u03bd\n\u03bd\nA+ \u03c8[p] (x) = 0 and A+ \u03c8[p]\u22121 (x) = [p]\u03c8[p] (x).\nThe \"oscillator-like\" ladder operators are thus obtained by taking\n\u03bd \u2212 2n + 1\n,\n(22)\nKo (n) =\n(\u03bd \u2212 n)(\u03bd \u2212 2n \u2212 1)\nk(n) =\n\nwhile we see that Ke (n) = Ko (n)(\u03bd \u2212 1 \u2212 n) for the \"energy-like\" ladder operators.\n3.3. The harmonic oscillator limit\nk0\nThe harmonic oscillator limit [22] is obtained by first shifting the Morse potential by V0 = 2\u03b2\n2\nto get\nV1 = V0 (1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03b2x )2 = VM + V0 ,\n(23)\nand then taking \u03b2 \u2192 0 so that V1 \u2192 12 k 0 x2 where k 0 is the force constant. Note that the new\nHamiltonian with potential V1 has thus the energy levels shifted and we get\n\"\u0012\n\u00132 \u0010 \u0011 #\n2\n\u03bd\n\u2212\n1\n~\n\u03bd 2\n.\n(24)\nEn1 = \u2212\n\u03b22\n\u2212n \u2212\n2mr\n2\n2\n\u221a\n\n0\n\nSince, \u03bd is given by (14), we get here \u03bd = 2 \u03b2m2 ~r k . The oscillator limit is obtained when \u03bd \u2192 \u221e\ngiving, as expected, an infinite spectrum and the good limit for the energies\nr\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\nk0\n1\nlim E = ~\nn+\n.\n\u03bd\u2192\u221e n\nmr\n2\nSecond, we have to take the\nq limit on the ladder operators. We replace \u03b2 by its expression in\n0\nterms of \u03bd and define c = 4m~2r k . The annihilation operator A\u2212 , given in (19), thus takes the\nform:\n\u221ac\n#\n\" \u221ac\nx\nx\np\n\u03bd\n\u03bd\nd\ne\n\u03bd\ne\nA\u2212 = K(n) \u221a\n(\u03bd \u2212 2n)\n+\n(\u03bd \u2212 2n \u2212 1)(\u03bd \u2212 2n) \u2212\n.\n(25)\ndx\n2\u03bd\n2\nc\u03bd\nSince K(n) depends also on \u03bd, we have to take the limit carefully. To solve it, just take the\nTaylor expansion of the exponential to the first order. We then see that K(n) must behave as\n\u03bd \u22121 , which is exactly what we get from (22) and we find\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\nd\nc\nlim A\u2212 = \u221a\n+ x .\n(26)\n\u03bd\u2192\u221e\nc dx 2\nA similar calculation gives the expected limit for A+ .\n\n\f3.4. Squeezed coherent states and their time evolution\nThe squeezed coherent states of the Morse Hamiltonian are now defined as the finite sum\n[p]\u22121\nX Z(z, \u03b3, n)\n1\np\np\n\u03c8n\u03bd (x),\n\u03a8 (z, \u03b3, x) =\n\u03bd\nN (z, \u03b3) n=0\n\u03c1(n)\n\u03bd\n\n(27)\n\nwhere \u03c1(n) is given in (3), Z(z, \u03b3, n) satisfies (8) and\n[p]\u22121\n\nN \u03bd (z, \u03b3) =\n\nX |Z(z, \u03b3, n)|2\n.\n\u03c1(n)\n\n(28)\n\nn=0\n\nSuch a definition is relevant since we have seen in the preceding subsection that the\n\"oscillator-like\" ladder operators tend to the ones of the harmonic oscillator when k(n) = n\nand the appropriate limit is taken. Moreover, these states are \"almost\" eigenstates of a linear\ncombination of the generic ladder operators A\u2212 and A+ which can be written as:\n(A\u2212 + \u03b3 A+ ) \u03a8\u03bd (z, \u03b3, x) \u2248 z\u03a8\u03bd (z, \u03b3, x).\n\n(29)\n\nIn fact, the correction can be computed using the recurrence relation (8) and we find\n\u03bd\n\u03bd\n\u03c7\u03bd (z, \u03b3, [p], x) = \u039b1 (z, \u03b3, [p])\u03c8[p]\u22121\n(x) + \u039b0 (z, \u03b3, [p])\u03c8[p]\n(x),\n\n(30)\n\nwhere\n\u039b1 (z, \u03b3, [p]) =\n\u039b0 (z, \u03b3, [p]) =\n\n1\n\nZ(z, \u03b3, [p]),\n\u03c1[p]\u22121\n1\n\u221a \u03b3k([p])Z(z, \u03b3, [p] \u2212 1).\n\u03c1[p]\n\u221a\n\n(31)\n\nIn practice, the last two terms of the sum in (27) have a very weak contribution which justifies\nthus the term \"almost\" eigenstates used above.\nOther constructions of squeezed coherent states have been considered (see, for example,\n[19, 22]). They implicitly use the displacement operator D. It must be questioned first because\nwe are dealing with a finite number of eigenstates in (27). Indeed, the action of this operator is\nnot well defined even if we take a finite development of the exponentials. Moreover the BakerCampbell-Hausdorff formulae for expanding D (as products of exponentials of simple operators)\nis not necessarily valid (see, for example [29]). Secondly, only one parameter is involved in this\ndisplacement operator, that is the reason why they are called coherent states by these authors\n[19, 22] . They are, in fact, special cases of our squeezed coherent states where z and \u03b3 are not\nindependent (\u03b3 6= 0).\nSince our squeezed coherent states are closely related to the ones of the harmonic oscillator,\nwe are interested in the behaviour of these states in the physical observable-position x and\nobservable-momentum p. Here these observables are not obtained as linear combinations of the\nladder operators (as we can see from (19) and (20)) and we must compute the mean values\nexplicitly.\nFor an arbitrary observable \u03b8, we have h\u03b8i(z, \u03b3; t) = h\u03a8\u03bd (z, \u03b3, x; t)|\u03b8|\u03a8\u03bd (z, \u03b3, x; t)i, where the\ntime evolution of our squeezed coherent states is given by\n[p]\u22121\nX Z(z, \u03b3, n) iEn\n1\np\np\ne\u2212 ~ t \u03c8n\u03bd (x)\n\u03a8 (z, \u03b3, x; t) =\n\u03bd\nN (z, \u03b3) n=0\n\u03c1(n)\n\u03bd\n\n(32)\n\n\fand we get explicitly\n1\nN \u03bd (z, \u03b3)\n\nh\u03b8i(z, \u03b3; t) =\n\n[p]\u22121\n\nX |Z(z, \u03b3, n)|2\nh\u03b8in,n\n\u03c1(n)\n\nn=0\n\n[p]\u22121 [p]\u22121\u2212n\n\nX\n\n+\n\nn=0\n\nX Z \u2217 (z, \u03b3, n + k) Z(z, \u03b3, n)\np\np\n\u03c1(n\n+\nk)\n\u03c1(n)\nk=1\n\ni(En+k \u2212En )\n\u2212\nt\n~\n\n(e\n\nh\u03b8in,n+k + e\n\ni(En+k \u2212En )\nt\n~\n\n!\nh\u03b8in+k,n ) ,\n\n(33)\n\nwhere\n\u03bd\nh\u03b8im,n = h\u03c8m\n|\u03b8|\u03c8n\u03bd i.\n\n(34)\n\nIn the following developments, we are considering observables which are such that h\u03b8im,n are\nsymmetric or skewsymmetric with respect to the exchange of m and n. We are thus led to two\ndifferent cases.

We do not have an analytic expression but we will be able to compute explicitly\nhx\u03022 in+k,n and hx\u03022 in,n since we have a finite number of these expressions to plug in hx\u03022 i(z, \u03b3; t).\n3.5. Oscillator-like squeezed coherent states\nIn this case, in accordance with the expression of \u03c1(n) given in (3), we take k(i) = i and\n\u03c1(n) = n! and we get Zo (z, \u03b3, n) = Zho (z, \u03b3, n) = (9). For the special case where \u03b3 = 0, we get\nZho (z, 0, n) = z n while, for the squeezed vacuum z = 0, we get\nZo (0, \u03b3, 2n) =\n\n(2n)! \u0010 \u03b3 \u0011n\n\u2212\n,\nn!\n2\n\nZo (0, \u03b3, 2n + 1) = 0.\n\n(43)\n\nMoreover, in those states, we get the same probability distribution as for the harmonic oscillator:\n1\nPo (z, \u03b3, n) = | \u03c8n \u03bd(x)|\u03c8 (z, \u03b3, x) | = \u03bd\nNo (z, \u03b3)\n2\n\n\u0012\n\n|\u03b3|\n2\n\n\u0013n |H(n, \u221az )|2\n2\u03b3\nn!\n\n(44)\n\nwith\nNo\u03bd (z, \u03b3)\n\n[p]\u22121 \u0012\n\n=\n\nX\n\nn=0\n\n|\u03b3|\n2\n\n\u0013n |H(n, \u221az )|2\n2\u03b3\nn!\n\n.\n\n(45)\n\nThe mean value and dispersion of the number operator N\u0302 are now given by\n[p]\u22121\n\nhN\u0302 io =\n\nX\n\n[p]\u22121\n\n[p]\u22121\n\nn Po (z, \u03b3, n), (\u2206N\u0302 )2o =\n\nn=0\n\nX\n\nn2 Po (z, \u03b3, n) \u2212 (\n\nX\n\nn Po (z, \u03b3, n))2 .\n\n(46)\n\nn=0\n\nn=0\n\nThe statistical properties of these states are similar to the ones of the harmonic oscillator since\nwe get essentially the same quantity for the Mandel's Q-parameter [31] given in general by\nQ(z, \u03b3) =\n\n(\u2206N\u0302 )2 \u2212 hN\u0302 i\nhN\u0302 i\n\n.\n\n(47)\n\nThe only difference is that, in the calculation of the dispersion and mean values in N\u0302 , the sums\nare now finite. In particular, it is well-known (see, for example, [7]) that the probability density\nis a Poisson distribution in the special coherent case (\u03b3 = 0).\n3.6. Energy-like squeezed coherent states\nIn this case, in accordance with the expression of \u03c1(n) given in (3), we take k(i) = i(2p \u2212 i) and\n\u03c1(n) = (\u22121)n n!(1 \u2212 2p)n where (a)n is the usual notation for the Pochhammer symbol\n(a)n = a(a + 1)(a + 2)...(a + n \u2212 1) =\n\n\u0393(a + n)\n.\n\u0393(a)\n\n(48)\n\n\fThe exact (infinite) recurrence relation (8) can be solved directly in terms of hypergeometric\nfunctions. The solution is\n!\n\u0393(2p)\n\u2212n, \u2212 2\u221az \u03b3 + 1\u22122p\nn n\n2 ; 2 , n = 1, 2, ..., [p] \u2212 1.\nZe (z, \u03b3, n) = (\u22121) \u03b3 2\n(49)\n2 F1\n\u0393(2p \u2212 n)\n1 \u2212 2p\nSince this result is far from being trivial, we give some details of the proof and also the expressions\nof few first polynomials of this sequence.\nLet us first set\nk(n) = n(A \u2212 n), A \u2208 R,\n(50)\nso that the recurrence relation (8) becomes\nZ(z, \u03b3, n + 1) \u2212 z Z(z, \u03b3, n) + \u03b3 n(A \u2212 n) Z(z, \u03b3, n \u2212 1) = 0, n = 1, 2, ...\n\n(51)\n\nwith Z(z, \u03b3, 0) = 1 and thus Z(z, \u03b3, 1) = z. Since we know the solution for the harmonic\noscillator (i.e. when k(n) = n), we follow the same lines to solve (51) for an infinite sequence of\nvalues of n. We introduce the new complex variable w = \u221az2\u03b3 and we take\nZ(z, \u03b3, n) =\n\n\u0010\u03b3 \u0011n\n2\n\n2\n\nf (n, w),\n\n(52)\n\nWe thus get a new recurrence relation on the functions f (n, w):\nf (n+1, w)\u22122w f (n, w)+2n(A\u2212n) f (n\u22121, w) = 0, f (1, w) = 2w, f (0, w) = 1, n = 1, 2, ... (53)\nIt is easy to see that f (n, w) is in fact a polynomial of degree n in w. Moreover, it can be\nexpressed in terms of hypergeometric functions of the type 2 F1 . We explicitly get\nn\n\nf (n, w) = 2 2 (\u2212A + 1)n 2 F1\n\n\u0012\n\u2212n, \u2212 \u221aw2 +\n1\u2212A\n\n1\u2212A \u0013\n2 ;2\n\n(54)\n\nand the hypergeometric function is in fact a polynomial in w since we have\n\u0012\n\u0013 X\nn\n2k (\u2212n)k (\u2212v)k\n\u2212n, \u2212v\n;2 =\n.\n2 F1\n1\u2212A\nk! (\u2212A + 1)k\n\n(55)\n\nk=0\n\nThe original function (52) thus takes the form (49) when A = 2p as expected. It is valid for\nany real value of A and in fact, we see that the first polynomials of the sequence are given by\nZe (z, \u03b3, 0)\nZe (z, \u03b3, 2)\nZe (z, \u03b3, 3)\nZe (z, \u03b3, 4)\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\n1, Z(z, \u03b3, 1) = z,\nz 2 \u2212 (A \u2212 1)\u03b3,\nz 3 \u2212 (3A \u2212 5)\u03b3z,\nz 4 \u2212 2(3A \u2212 7)z 2 \u03b3 + 3(A \u2212 1)(A \u2212 3)\u03b3 2 .\n\nTo be complete, let us mention that for the special case where A is an integer, we see that\nthe recurrence relation (53) splits in two different ones. Indeed, we get first a finite sequence\nof f (n, w) satisfying (53) for n = 1, 2, ..., A \u2212 1 and, second an infinite sequence of f (n, w) for\nn = A, A + 1, ... satisfying the recurrence relation\nf (A + k + 1, w) \u2212 2w f (A + k, w) \u2212 2k(A + k) f (A + k \u2212 1, w) = 0, k = 0, 1, 2, ...\n\n(56)\n\n\fSince for k = 0, we get f (A + 1, w) = 2wf (A, w), we can write f (A + k, w) = h(k, w)f (A, w)\nwhere h(k, w) is a polynomial of degree k in w satisfying the recurrence relation\nh(k + 1, w) \u2212 2w h(k, w) + 2k(\u2212A \u2212 k) h(k \u2212 1, w) = 0, h(1, w) = 2w, h(0, w) = 1, k = 1, 2, ...,\n(57)\nwhich is (53) where A has been replaced by \u2212A.

They both satisfy discrete orthogonality relations on the variable\nw but these are not relevant in our context since w is a continuous parameter.\nWhen \u03b3 = 0, we get Ze (z, 0, n) = z n leading to coherent states while for the squeezed vacuum\n(z = 0), we get\nZe (0, \u03b3, 2n) = 4(n\u22121) (1 \u2212 2p)(3/2)n\u22121 (3/2 \u2212 p)n\u22121 \u03b3 n ,\n\nZe (0, \u03b3, 2n + 1) = 0.\n\n(59)\n\nNow the probability distribution, denoted by Pe (z, \u03b3, n)e , is given by\nPe (z, \u03b3, n) =\n\n1\n\u0393(2p \u2212 n)\n|Z(z, \u03b3, n)|2 ,\nNe\u03bd (z, \u03b3) \u0393(2p)n!\n\n(60)\n\nwhere\n[p]\u22121\n\nNe\u03bd (z, \u03b3)\n\n=\n\nX \u0393(2p \u2212 n)\n|Z(z, \u03b3, n)|2 .\n\u0393(2p)n!\n\n(61)\n\nn=0\n\nSimilar expressions for hN\u0302 ie and (\u2206N\u0302 )2e are obtained as in (46).\n4. Behaviour of the squeezed coherent states for the case of the hydrogen chloride\nmolecule\nFor the hydrogen chloride molecule 1 H35 Cl (already considered in a previous paper [20]), we will\nfix the values of the physical parameter \u03bd given in (14) with published values of mr , \u03b2 and V0 ,\nor as most often in practice, using \u03bd = \u03c9e /\u03c9e xe , the ratio between the experimentally measured\nmolecular harmonicity \u03c9e and anharmonicity \u03c9e xe constants (see for example [33, 34, 35, 36]).\nFor the ground state, X 1 \u03a3+ we have \u03bd \u2248 57.44 and [p] = 28. We also choose the units such\n~\nthat 2m\n= 1 and \u03b2 = 1.\nr\nLet us start with some general facts. First, the squeezing parameter must be restricted\nto |\u03b3| < 1 for the states to be normalisable (as for the harmonic oscillator). Second, the\nminimisation of the Heisenberg uncertainty relation depends on the values of z when \u03b3 is real\n(and less than 1). Finally, we will see that the squeezing effect(reduction of the dispersion of one\nobservable at the price of increasing it in the other) is always present even for \u03b3 = 0. Moreover,\nthe dispersion in x\u0302 may be chosen smaller for the energy-like than for the oscillator-like states\nleading to a better localisation for the energy-like states.\nIn order to compare our results with the well-known ones for the harmonic oscillator, we\nrestrict ourselves to positive real values of z and \u03b3 with \u03b3 < 1. In fact, no dramatic difference\nappear when z and/or \u03b3 are negatives.\n\n\f4.1. Coherent system of states (\u03b3 = 0)\nThe oscillator-like and energy-like states differ only by the denominator (and the normalisation\nfactor) in the development (27). In Fig 1, we show the trajectories for both states with z = 2\nand t \u2208 [0, 1] and we see that the oscillator-like states are less stable than the energy-like ones\nfor the same value of z. This is true when z < 20. We also see that, even if \u03b3 = 0, squeezing\nalways appears in the coherent system of states for the Morse potential.\nAt t = 0, the uncertainty product \u2206(z, 0) = (\u2206x)2 (\u2206p)2 and the dispersion (\u2206x)2 show a\nvery stable behaviour in z for the energy-like states (see Fig 2). These states are mostly minimal\nuncertainty states and the dispersion in x is very small leading to a very good localisation (at\nleast for z < 20). This last fact is confirmed by the large eccentricity (in fact, it is very close\nto 1) of the ellipses obtained before. Interestingly, if we want to minimise the dispersion in p,\nwe see, again on Fig 2, that \u2206(z, 0) is no longer minimized. Also, reducing the dispersion in\np increases the dispersion in x. Moreover, we can easily see that the best minimisation of the\ndispersion in p is observed in this special case, i.e. for \u03b3 = 0. The oscillator-like states have\nalmost the same behaviour but \u2206(z, 0) increases faster for smaller values of z (around z = 3).\nFinally, the density probabilities of both types of states have been computed to confirm\nthe preceding results. In Fig 3, the energy-like states show again a better behaviour then the\noscillator-like states as time evolves.\n\n10\n\n<p>\n\n5\n\n0\n\n-5\n\n-10\n\n-0.2\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n0.4\n<x>\n\n0.6\n\nFigure 1.\n\nPhase-space trajectories for oscillator-like (dashed line) and energy-like (plain line) states\nwhen (z, \u03b3) = (2, 0) and t \u2208 [0, 1].\n\n4.2. Squeezed vacuum (z = 0)\nIn this case, both types of states are polynomials in \u03b3 and only even combinations of\neigenfunctions appear (see (43) and (59)).

In Fig 4, we have compared the trajectories for the\nenergy-like states when \u03b3 = 0.2, 0.5 and 0.7.\nAt t = 0, the uncertainty product \u2206(0, \u03b3) = (\u2206x)2 (\u2206p)2 and the dispersion (\u2206x)2 take\nalmost the same values for both types of states. Minimal uncertainty is satisfied for \u03b3 \u2208 [0, 0.2]\nand we get very small values of the dispersion in x for the same values of \u03b3. The behaviour is\nsimilar to the one in Fig 2.\nWith respect to the statistical properties, Fig 5 shows bunching effects of Q(0, \u03b3) > 0 both\nfor the energy-like and oscillator-like states. It confirms that both types of states have similar\nstatistical behaviour. Finally, the density probability has been computed for the energy-like\nstates. In Fig 6 we see that the best localisation occurs when \u03b3 is smaller than 0.2. We see also,\nby observing the time evolution, that the vacuum states are less stable than the coherent states.\nSimilar behaviour is observed for the oscillator-like states.\n4.3. General system of states\nIn this case, we observe that the trajectories deviate quickly from closed curves while the\nminimum uncertainty is still realised but when \u03b3 < 0.2 . The graphs for the Mandel's parameter\nfor z = 2 are given in Fig 7.

More significant\nanti-bunching effect is observed for oscillator-like states showing a steady effect for r < 0 and a\nminimum for r > 0 (when \u03b3 \u2248 0.2).\nThe calculations of observables for other diatomic molecules can be done in a similar way.\nFor example, we have done such calculations for the molecule 133 Cs2 which has a larger value\nfor \u03bd. Indeed, we have \u03bd \u2248 524.55 and thus [p] = 261. We have obtained similar behaviour for\nboth types of states that is not relevant to produce here.\n5. Conclusions\nIn this paper, we have introduced squeezed coherent states of a quantum system with a finite\ndiscrete energy spectrum described by the Morse potential. These states are almost eigenstates of\nlinear combination of ladder operators and are characterised by two continuous parameters z and\n\u03b3. We have considered two different types of ladder operators and constructed the corresponding\noscillator-like and energy-like squeezed coherent states.\n\n\fWe have investigated the behaviour of these states regarding localisation and minimum\nuncertainty. The calculation of the dispersions and mean values have been done analytically\nexcept for the mean value of x\u03022 for which the analytical form is not known. We have computed\nthe Mandel's parameter to investigate the statistical properties of our states.\nThe oscillator-like squeezed coherent states are closely related to the similar states of the\nharmonic oscillator. However, they do not have a very good localisation except for the vacuum\ncase for \u03b3 small and they exhibit a certain deviation from the minimal uncertainty principle. The\nenergy-like squeezed coherent states minimise better the uncertainty relation for the case \u03b3 = 0\nand we get a good localisation in position. They are more stable in time than the oscillator-like\nstates. Both type of states have similar statistical properties.\nAcknowledgements\nV.
