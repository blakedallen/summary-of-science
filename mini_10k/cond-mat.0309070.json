Theoretical studies of pulse dynamics in frictionless chains\nhave relied primarily on numerical solution of the equations of motion [3, 6, 8, 9, 10, 13, 16]. Analytic work has\nrelied on two rather different approximations with very\nlittle direct comparison between them. One approach\nis based on continuum approximations to the equations\nequations of motion followed by exact or approximate solutions of these approximate equations [8, 16, 17]. This\napproach is expected to give useful results when the pulse\nis not too narrow, i.e., when the velocity distribution of\nthe grains in the chain at any instant of time is rather\nsmooth. The other approach is based on phenomenology\nabout properties of pairwise (or at times three-body) collisions together with the assumption that pulses are sufficiently narrow to involve only two or three grains at any\none time [14, 18, 19]. Among the interesting quantities\none aims to calculate with these approaches is the pulse\nvelocity. In turn, successful calculation of the pulse velocity requires a good understanding of the pulse width.\nThe standard generic model potential between\nmonodisperse elastic granules that repel upon overlap according to the Hertz law is given by [20, 21]\nV (\u03b4k,k+1 ) =\n\na\nn\nn |\u03b4|k,k+1 ,\n\nV (\u03b4k,k+1 ) = 0,\n\n\u03b4 \u2264 0,\n(1)\n\u03b4 > 0.\n\nHere\n\u03b4k,k+1 \u2261 yk \u2212 yk+1 ,\n\n(2)\n\na is a constant that depends on the Young's modulus and\nPoisson's ratio, and yk is the displacement of granule k\nfrom its equilibrium position. The exponent n is 5/2 for\nspheres, it is 2 for cylinders, and in general depends on\ngeometry.\nThe displacement of the k-th granule (k = 1, 2, . . . , L)\nin the chain from its equilibrium position in a frictionless\n\nmedium is thus governed by the equation of motion\nm\n\nd2 yk\n= \u2212a(yk \u2212 yk+1 )n\u22121 \u03b8(yk \u2212 yk+1 )\nd\u03c4 2\n+a(yk\u22121 \u2212 yk )n\u22121 \u03b8(yk\u22121 \u2212 yk ).\n\n(3)\n\nHere \u03b8(y) is the Heavyside function, \u03b8(y) = 1 for y > 0,\n\u03b8(y) = 0 for y < 0, and \u03b8(0) = 1/2. It ensures that the\nparticles interact only when in contact. Note that for a\nfinite open chain the first term on the right hand side of\nthis equation is absent for the last granule and the second\nterm is absent for the first.\nInitially the granules are placed along a line so that\nthey just touch their neighbors in their equilibrium positions (no precompression), and all but the leftmost particle are at rest. The initial velocity of the leftmost particle\nis v0 (the impulse). In terms of the rescaled variables\nyk =\n\n\u0012\n\nmv02\na\n\n\u00131/n\n\nxk ,\n\n1\n\u03c4=\nv0\n\n\u0012\n\nmv02\na\n\n\u00131/n\n\nt,\n\n(4)\n\nEq. (3) can be rewritten as\n\u1e8dk = \u2212(xk \u2212 xk+1 )n\u22121 \u03b8(xk \u2212 xk+1 )\n+(xk\u22121 \u2212 xk )n\u22121 \u03b8(xk\u22121 \u2212 xk ),\n\n(5)\n\nwhere a dot denotes a derivative with respect to t. In the\nrescaled variables the initial conditions become xk (0) =\n\u1e8bk (0) = 0, \u2200k 6= 1, x1 (0) = 0, and \u1e8b1 (0) = 1.\nWhen n > 2 an initial impulse settles into a pulse that\nis increasingly narrow with increasing n, and propagates\nat a velocity that is essentially constant and determined\nby n and by the amplitude of the pulse. For n = 2 the\npulse spreads in time and travels at a constant velocity\nindependent of pulse amplitude. In the latter case there is\nconsiderable backscattering that leads to backward motion of all the granules behind the pulse, whereas the\nbackscattering is minimal for n > 2 [8, 22]. The pulse\nis a completely conservative solitary wave in the limit\nn \u2192 \u221e.\nThree features determine pulse dynamics in these\nchains:\n1. The power n in the potential;\n2.

Here, the theoretical pulse velocity CT , is either the one obtained from\nthe continuum (circles) or from the binary collision (squares)\napproximation. CS is the pulse velocity obtained from the\nnumerical simulations of the chain.\n\n3. The discreteness of the system.\nRecently, we discussed the role each of these features in\nthe continuum approximation and extended previous results to include viscosity [22]. Not only does this approximation work very well for the n = 2 case [8, 22], but,\ncorroborating Nesterenko's theory[17], we found that the\ncontinuum approximation works surprisingly well for the\nprototypical grain, namely spheres. However, a discussion of the reasons for this agreement seems to be lacking. On the other hand, models based on binary interactions have also been proposed in order to study a chain\nof spherical and other grains. Wu's independent-collision\nmodel [14] focuses on a chain of tapered grains. From energy and momentum conservation considerations, working in the n \u2192 \u221e limit, he shows that his simple model\ncaptures the qualitative behavior observed in simulations\nfor spheres. Subsequently this model was phenomenologically extended and compared with experimental results [15].\nHerein we address the question of the applicability of\nboth the continuum approximation and a binary interaction model through the analysis of the velocity of the\nsignal propagation as a function of the power of the potential. For the former case, the pulse velocity, Cc (n),\ncan be written as [22]\n\nCc (n) =\n\nr\n\n\uf8ee\n\n2\uf8ef\n\uf8f0\nn\n\n\uf8f9 n\u22122\n2n\n\nn2 (n \u2212 2)\n\uf8fa\nq\n\u0011\uf8fb\n\u0010\nn(n\u22121)\n4\nI n\u22122\n2(n + 2)\n6\n\n,\n\n(6)\n\nwhere\n\u0001\n\u03932 l+1\n2\n.\nI(l) = 2\n\u0393(l + 1)\nl\n\n(7)\n\nOn the other hand, for the binary collision approximation the set of equations (5) reduces to two coupled\nequations which may be decoupled by defining the normal mode variables z\u00b1 = x1 \u00b1 x2 . In particular, we have\nn\u22121\nz\u0308\u2212 = \u22122z\u2212\n.\n\n(8)\n\nThis is precisely the equation of motion for one particle subjected to a potential V (z) = 2z n /n. Furthermore,\nthe initial conditions for the original variables lead to\nz\u2212 (0) = 0 and \u017c\u2212 (0) = 1. Hence, from energy conservation we have:\n1 2\n1\n2 n\n\u017c\u2212 (t) \u2212 = \u2212 z\u2212\n(t).\n2\n2\nn\n\n(9)\n\nConsequently, when the two particles have the same velocity (\u017c\u2212 = 0), their compression will be a maximum\n\u00011/n\nand given by zm = n4\n. Therefore, the time necessary for the \"pulse\" to travel from the first to the second\nparticle is\nZ zm\n1\np\ndz\u2212 .\n(10)\nTb (n) =\nn /n\n1\n\u2212\n4z\u2212\n0\n\nExplicitly integrating Eq. (10), we can write the pulse\nvelocity Cb (n) = 1/Tb (n), as\n\u0012 \u00131/n 1\n\u0393( 2 + n1 )\n1\n4\nCb (n) = 1/2\n(11)\nn\n\u03c0\n\u0393(1 + n1 )\nOur comparison is thus between Eqs. (6) and (11).\nQualitatively both approximations give the same result: for n & 2 the pulse velocity decreases with n, attaining its minimum value for n \u2243 5, and then increasing\n\n\f3\nand saturating for large n (see Fig. 1). Quantitatively,\nhowever, they differ appreciably. For instance, for large\nn, Cb \u2192 1 while Cc \u2192 0.883 . . .. In Fig. 2 we present the\nrelative error of our numerical simulation of the chain\nas compared with each theory. From this figure, it is\neasy to see that while the continuum approximation gives\nvery good results for small n, its predictions are poor for\nn & 3.5. On the other hand, the binary collision approximation is extremely accurate for n > 3.5 but not accurate\nfor small n. The quantitative agreement of each of the\ntwo analytic results at their respective n extremes with\nthe numerical simulations is seen to be excellent. Again,\nwe stress that these results are a reflection of the behavior of the pulse width. At smaller n the pulse is relatively\nbroad, the velocity pulse covers a number of grains [22],\nand a continuum approximation captures the pulse configuration and speed very well. At larger n the pulse\nbecomes very narrow, discreteness effects dominate the\n\n[1] R. S. MacKay, Phys. Lett. A 251, 191 (1999).\n[2] S. Sen and M. Manciu, Phys. Rev. E 64, 056605 (2001).\n[3] R. S.
