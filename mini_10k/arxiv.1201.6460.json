Finally, we illustrate numerically the position of the free boundary separating corroded from\nnot-yet-corroded regions.\n\n1. Introduction\n1.1. Background on sulfate corrosion. Often in service-life predictions of concrete structures\n(e.g., sewer systems), the effects of chemical and biological corrosion processes are fairly neglected.\nIn sewer systems and wastewater treatment facilities, where high concentrations of hydrogen\nsulfide, moisture, and oxygen are present in the atmosphere, the deterioration of concrete is\ncaused mainly by biogenic acids. The so-called microbially-induced concrete corrosion in sewer\nsystems has been a serious unsolved problem1 for long time. The presence of microorganisms\nsuch as fungi, algae or bacteria can induce formation of aggressive biofilms on concrete surfaces.\nParticularly, the sulfuric acid that causes corrosion of sewer crowns is generated by such a complex\nmicrobial ecosystem especially in hot environments. The precise role of microorganisms in the\ncontext of sulfates attack on concrete (here we focus on sewer pipes) is quite complex and is\ntherefore less understood from both experimental and theoretical points of view; see, e.g., the\nexperimental studies [4] (optimum pH and growth kinetics of four relevant bacterial strains),\n[11] (characteristics of the crown microbial system), [12] (microbiologically influenced corrosion\nof natural sandstone), [16] (succession of sulfur-oxidizing bacteria in the bacterial community\non corroding concrete), [17] (isolation of Thiobacillus thiooxidans), [21] (Hamburg sewers),[24]\n(air-water transfer of hydrogen sulfide). As a consequence of this, an accurate large-time forecast\nof the penetration of the sulfate corrosion front is very difficult to obtain.\nKey words and phrases. Reaction-diffusion system, sulfate corrosion, pH, free boundary, micro-macro transmission condition, multiscale numerical methods.\n1\nThere are a lot of financial implications if you want to change the network of pipes in a city like Fukuoka.\nOur statement here is that questions like Why changing the pipes if corrosion is not so strong yet and therefore\nthe mechanics structure of the network can/could still hold for 5 more years? can be addressed in a rigorous\nmathematical multiscale framework. Such an approach would allow a good understanding and prediction at least\nof extreme situations.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nVLADIM\u00cdR CHALUPECK\u00dd, TASNIM FATIMA, JENS KRUSCHWITZ, AND ADRIAN MUNTEAN\n\nWe want to stress the fact that concrete, in spite of its strong heterogeneity, is mechanically\na well-understood material with known composition. Also, the cement (paste) chemistry is well\nunderstood. However, all cement-based materials (including concrete) involve a combination\nof \"heterogeneous multi-phase material\", \"multiscale chemistry\", \"multiscale transport\" (flow,\ndiffusion, ionic fluxes, etc.), and \"multiscale\" mechanics. Having in view this complexity, such\nmaterials are sensu stricto very difficult to describe, to analyze mathematically, and last but not\nleast, to deal with numerically. We expect that only after the multiscale aspects of such materials\nare handled properly, good predictions of the large-time behavior may be obtained. This is our\npath to addressing this corrosion scenario that is often referred to as the sulfatation problem.\nBefore closing these background notes, let us add some remarks [20] on a closely-related topic\nof acid sulphate soils2, which might attract the attention of the multiscale research in the near\nfuture. Acid sulphate soils are an important class of soils worldwide. Particularly in coastal\nareas, sediments often contain a large amount of iron sulfide (FeS and/or FeS2 ). When by\ndrainage the sediment is exposed to air, this iron sulfide will oxidize to iron sulphate (FeSO4 ).\nAs long as the sediment still contains calcium carbonate (CaCO3 ), the FeS will react with it,\nresulting in gypsum (CaSO4 ) and iron oxide (Fe2 O3 ). Gypsum, being much more soluble than\ncalcium carbonate, will tend to leach to the ground- and surface-waters. If the FeS O4 is no longer\nremoved by reactions with CaCO3 or other materials, it will tend to accumulate, resulting in a\ndrop of the pH below 4. The problematic acid sulphate soil then will have become a reality. Acid\nsulphate soils were first described in 1886 by the Dutch Chemist Jacob Maarten van Bemmelen,\nin connection with problems arising in the Haarlemmermeer Polder. Much of the work in this\ndirection is/was done in the tropics, including Indonesia, Vietnam, and Australia; see, e.g., [13].\n1.2. Objectives and structure of the paper. In order to be able to tackle the biophysics\nof the problem at a later stage, eventually coupled with the mechanics of the concrete and the\nactual capturing of the macroscopic fracture initiation, we focus here on a much simpler setting\nmodeling the multiscale transport and reaction of the active chemical species involved in the\nsulfatation process. Therefore, the approach and results reported here are only preliminary.\nOur main objective is twofold: using a multiscale reaction-diffusion system for concrete corrosion (that allows for feedback between micro and macro scales),\n\u2022 calculate pH profiles and detect the eventual presence of \"sudden\" pH drops;\n\u2022 extract from gypsum concentration profiles the approximate position of macroscopic\ncorrosion fronts.\nIn Section 2, we present the reaction mechanisms taking place in sewer pipes. In Section 3, we\ngive a mathematical description of the problem and we set a two-scale PDE-ODE system. We\nbriefly comment on a few mathematical properties of the model. In Section 4, we approximate a\nmacroscopic pH numerically using a multiscale FD scheme and comment briefly on the numerical\nresults.\n2. A few notes on the involved chemistry\nOur model includes two important features:\n\u2022 continuous transfer of H2 S from water to air phase and vice versa;\n\u2022 fast production of gypsum at solid-water interface.\nWe incorporate the Henry's law to model the transfer of H2 S from the water to the air phase\nand vice versa [2, 24]. The production of gypsum at the solid-water interface is modeled by a\nnon-linear reaction rate, given by (15).\n2\nCompared to concrete, soils are much easier to handle. Their mechanics is simpler and their chemistry is\noften rudimentary, if any.\n\n\fCOMPUTATIONS OF CORROSION FRONT IN SEWER PIPES\n\n3\n\n\u0393sw\n\nH2 S\n\nYs\nY\n\na\n\n\u0393wa\n\nYw\n\nunit cell Y\nFigure 1.

Right: Our concept of pore geometry (microstructure).\n\nThere are many variants of severe attack to concrete in sewer pipes which influence the performance of concrete structure depending on the intensity of the reactions, the environment, and\nthe turbulence of the wastewater [23]. We focus here on the most aggressive one, namely we\nconsider the following reaction mechanisms causing sulfatation, viz.\n(1)\n\n10 H+ + SO2\u2212\n4 + org. matter \u2192 H2 S(aq) + 4 H2 O + oxidized matter\nH2 S(aq) + 2 O2 \u2192 2H+ + SO2\u2212\n4\n\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\n\nH2 S(aq)\n+\n\n2 H2 O + H +\n\nSO2\u2212\n4\n\nH2 S(g)\n\n+ CaCO3 \u2192 CaSO4 * 2 H2 O + HCO3\u2212\n\nReaction (3) is typically a surface reaction taking place as soon as water and air phases meet\ntogether. It plays an important role in transferring the H2 S from the air phase to the liquid phase\nwhere the corrosion actually takes place. For modeling details such as a Henry-like \"reaction\"\nmechanism, we refer the reader to [9, 5] and references cited therein.\n\n3. Multiscale description of the sulfatation problem\nWe assume that the geometry of our concrete sample (porous medium) consists of a system\nof pores periodically distributed inside a three-dimensional cube \u03a9 := [a, b]3 with a, b \u2208 R and\nb > a. The exterior boundary of \u03a9 consists of two disjoint, sufficiently smooth parts: the\nNeumann boundary \u0393N and the Dirichlet boundary \u0393D . We assume that the pores in concrete\nare made of stationary water film, air and solid parts in different ratios depending on the local\nporosity. The reference pore, say Y := [0, 1]3 , has three pair-wise disjoint domains Y s , Y w and\nY a with smooth boundaries \u0393sw and \u0393wa as shown in Fig. 1 such that\nY = \u0232 s \u222a \u0232 w \u222a \u0232 a .\nWe refer the reader to [9, 6] for more description of the multiscale geometry of the porous\nmaterial. For a single scale (macroscopic) approach of a sulfatation scenario, we refer the reader\nto [1], e.g.\nWe consider a two-scale system of PDEs and one ODE for unknown functions u1 : \u03a9\u00d7(0, T ) \u2192\nR, uk : \u03a9 \u00d7 Y w \u00d7 (0, T ) \u2192 R, k \u2208 {2, 3}, and u4 : \u03a9 \u00d7 \u0393sw \u00d7 (0, T ) \u2192 R where (0, T ) is the time\ninterval.

The coefficients d3 and B are effective\nones (see [9, 8] for a way of calculating them), while H can be read off from existing macroscopic\nexperimental data.\nWe consider the following form of the reaction rate \u03b7 at the interface \u0393sw\n(\n\u03b1p (\u03b2\u0304 \u2212 \u03b2)q , if \u03b1 \u2265 0, \u03b2 \u2265 0,\n(15)\n\u03b7(\u03b1, \u03b2) =\n0,\notherwise,\nwhere \u03b2\u0304 is a known maximum concentration of gypsum at \u0393sw and p \u2265 1, q \u2265 1 are partial\norders of reaction.

We focus on extracting the position of the corrosion\nfront and on the acid reaction, which we use to obtain macro-scale profiles of pH.

The reduction consists in taking \u03a9 := (0, L) and Y w = (0, `) as one-dimensional\nintervals, which in effect corresponds to analysing the specimen in a perpendicular direction to its\nsurface away from edges and to simplifying the micro cell geometry, respectively. The numerical\nscheme is based on the method of lines, where in space we use finite difference discretization\nand in time we employ an implicit higher-order time integrator for the solution of the non-linear\nODE system. See [6, 7] for further details of the numerical scheme, its analysis with respect\nto convergence to the weak solutions and some basic numerical experiments. For details of a\ncomputer implementation of the numerical scheme we refer the reader to [14, Chapter 7].\nIn Table 1 we summarize values of the model parameters used in the simulations described\nbelow.\n4.1.

Consequently, its concentration decreases with increasing depth. As the system becomes\nsaturated and as the sulfatation reaction (4) converts available cement into gypsum, the total\nconcentration of H2 S(g) starts to increase (Fig. 2).\nSulfuric acid that arises from the oxidation of H2 S(aq) then reacts at y = ` with the cement\npaste and converts it into gypsum (u4 ) whose concentration profile is shown in Fig. 3. Interestingly, although the behavior of u1 is as expected (i.e., purely diffusive), we notice that a\nmacroscopic gypsum layer (region where u4 is produced) is formed around t = 1500 and grows\nin time. The figure clearly indicates that there are two distinct regions separated by a slowly\nmoving intermediate layer: the left region-the place where the gypsum production reached saturation (a threshold), and the right region-the place of the ongoing sulfatation reaction (4) (the\ngypsum production has not yet reached here the natural threshold).\nWe use u4 to extract an approximate position of the corrosion front p(t) which we define as\n(in our scenario, we expect u4 to be decreasing)\np(t) := {x \u2208 (0, L) | u4 (x, t) = \u03b2\u0304 \u2212 \u03b5},\nwhere \u03b5 is a small parameter. Figure 4 shows a graph of p(t) arising from our numerical experiment. We notice that as the corroding front advances further into the concrete specimen, its\nrate of growth decreases. This is in agreement with experimental data since the hydrogen sulfide\ngas supplied from the outside environment has to be transported (by diffusion) over ever larger\ndistance. It is important to note that the precise position of the separating layer is a priori\nunknown and to capture it simultaneously with the computation of the concentration profile\nwould require a moving-boundary formulation similar to the one reported in [5].\n\n\f8\n\nVLADIM\u00cdR CHALUPECK\u00dd, TASNIM FATIMA, JENS KRUSCHWITZ, AND ADRIAN MUNTEAN\n\n6\n\npH\n\n5\n\n5\n\n4\n\n4\npH\n\npH\n\n6\n\n3\n\n3\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0\n\npH\n\n0\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\nx\n6\n\npH\n\n5\n\n5\n\n4\n\n4\npH\n\npH\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\nx\n\n6\n\n3\n\npH\n\n3\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\nx\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\nx\n\n6\n\n6\n\npH\n\n5\n\n5\n\n4\n\n4\npH\n\npH\n\n15\n\n3\n\n3\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0\n\npH\n\n0\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\nx\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\nx\n\nFigure 5.

Emission of hydrogen sulfide from the wastewater to the air space of sewer\npipe is an important process because the problems of hydrogen sulfide in sewer pipes are associated with gaseous hydrogen sulfide. Hydrogen sulfide is a weak acid with a dissociation constant\nof 7.0 (at 20\u25e6 C) and only the non-dissociated form is emitted in the air space sewer pipe. The\npH of the wastewater is therefore of importance when evaluating the potential hydrogen sulfide\nemission. After the hydrogen sulfide arrives at and diffuses into the concrete, the oxidation of\nhydrogen sulfide is biological once the pH of the solid matrix has dropped below approximately\n8\u20139 [18]. This represents the tendency of hydronium ions to interact with other components of\nthe solution, which affects among other things the electrical potential read using a pH meter.\nThe concentration of hydrogen ions is expressed as pH scale and pH is defined as a negative\ndecimal logarithm of the concentration of hydronium ions dissolved in a solution.\n\n\fCOMPUTATIONS OF CORROSION FRONT IN SEWER PIPES\n\n9\n\nAs the model considered in this paper contains information both from micro (pore) scale and\nmacro-scale, we need a way of computing macro-scale values of pH from the available microscale data. Such information is not readily available in the system (5). However, sulfuric acid\nis a diprotic acid with two stages of dissociation, where the first stage occurs fully and the\ndissociation in the second stage can be neglected. Therefore, the concentration of hydronium\nions is proportional to the concentration of sulfuric acid, which is represented by u3 in our model.\nWe extract the macro-scale concentration of sulfuric acid at each x by taking a volume average\nof u3 over Y w . Thus, we use the following expression for computing macroscopic pH:\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\nka\nu3 (x, y, t) dy ,\n(16)\npHmacro (x, t) = \u2212 log10\n|Y w | Y w\nwhere ka is the activity of hydronium ions.\nThe macro-scale pH profile computed using the formula (16) is shown in Figure 5. We can see\nthat at the beginning of the simulation (first graph) with increasing depth the pH also increases\nfrom acid to more basic values as expected. Once all the available cement is consumed and\nconverted into gypsum (this happens for the first time at x = 0 between the first and second\ngraph in Figure 5 around t = 1500), the pH drops rapidly across the corrosion front. This is\ndue to the fact that behind the corrosion front the sulfuric acid is no longer neutralised by the\nsulfatation reaction (4).\nNote that our pH profiles are not in the experimental range. We expect the size of the\ndrop will become comparable to the one seen in experiments as soon as effects of nonlinear\nmoisture transport and bacteria motility and chemical activity are taken into account in the\nmodel equations. The main message that we want to draw is that we are able to detect and\ncompute a macroscopic pH drop, once the needed micro-information is available.\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank Peter Raats (Wageningen), Hans Kuipers (Eindhoven) and Varvara Kouznetsova\n(Eindhoven) for useful discussions on this topic during a multiscale symposium that took place\nin Eindhoven in September 2011.\nReferences\n1.
