Comparing our result\nwith experimental data from precision hydrogen spectroscopy an upper bound for\nthe minimal length is obtained.\n\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nRecently a lot of attention has been attracted to the quantum mechanical problems\nlinked with generalized (modified) commutation relations. Such an interest was motivated\nby the works on quantum gravity and string theory which suggested the existence of a\nfinite lower bound to the possible resolution of length (minimal length) [1, 2, 3]. Kempf\net al. showed that minimal length can be obtained from the deformed Heisenberg algebra\n[4, 5, 6, 7, 8]. Note that for the first time the deformed algebra leading to quantized\nspace-time was introduced by Snyder in the relativistic case [9]. In D-dimensional case the\ndeformed algebra proposed by Kempf reads\n\n[Xi , Pj ] = ih\u0304(\u03b4ij (1 + \u03b2P 2) + \u03b2 \u2032 Pi Pj ), [Pi , Pj ] = 0,\n(2\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b2 \u2032 ) + (2\u03b2 + \u03b2 \u2032 )\u03b2P 2\n[Xi , Xj ] = ih\u0304\n(Pi Xj \u2212 Pj Xi ),\n1 + \u03b2P 2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b2, \u03b2 \u2032 are parameters of deformation. We suppose that these quantities are positive\n\u03b2, \u03b2 \u2032 \u2265 0. It can be seen that position operators do not commute so we have a noncom\u221a\nmutative space. From the uncertainty relation it follows that minimal length is h\u0304 \u03b2 + \u03b2 \u2032 .\n\u2217\n\u2020\n\nmykola@ktf.franko.lviv.ua\ntkachuk@ktf.franko.lviv.ua\n\n\f2\nNote that in the special case \u03b2 \u2032 = 2\u03b2 the position operators in linear approximation over\ndeformation parameters commute, i.e. [Xi , Xj ] = 0.\nThe hydrogen atom is one of the simplest quantum system allowing highly accurate\ntheoretical prediction and is well studied experimentally offering the most precisely measured\nquantities [10]. Therefore, this simple atom has a crucial role for our understanding of key\npoints of modern physics. Due to the singularity of the Coulomb potential at the origin this\nsystem is in particular sensitive to whether there is a fundamental minimal length. There\nare only a few papers on the investigation of hydrogen atom in quantum space with minimal\nlength [11, 12, 13].\nBrau [11] considered the special case of deformation \u03b2 \u2032 = 2\u03b2 and in the linear approximation over the deformation parameters the energy spectrum of hydrogen atom was calculated.\nThe general case of deformation \u03b2 \u2032 6= 2\u03b2 was studied in [12]. Using perturbation theory the\nauthors calculated correction to the energy spectrum of hydrogen atom. But in order to\ncalculate the corrections to s-levels for three dimensional space the authors were forced to\nuse a numerical method and cut off procedure due to the appear once of the term \u223c 1/r 3\n\nin the Hamiltonian in linear approximation over \u03b2, \u03b2 \u2032. We would like to emphasize that\n\nwithout cut off procedure this term leads to divergence the correction to s-levels.\nNote also paper [14] where the comparison between the \"space curvature\" effects and\nminimal length effects for the hydrogen spectrum was made. In [15] a one dimensional\nCoulomb problem was solved exactly.\nIn the present paper we propose the modified perturbation theory free of divergences\nwhich gives a possibility to calculate the corrections to all energy levels including s-levels.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In the second section we obtain corrections to the\nspectrum of D-dimensional Coulomb problem using ordinal perturbation theory. In the\nthird section we propose modified perturbation theory and calculate corrections to the energy\nof s-levels of hydrogen in three dimensional case. And finally fourth section contains the\ndiscussion.\n\nII.\n\nPERTURBATION OF THE ENERGY SPECTRUM\n\nIn this section we consider ordinal perturbation theory similarly as in [12] but using\nanother representation of the deformed algebra. This algebra is more convenient for the\n\n\f3\ndevelopment the modified perturbation theory.\nWe study the eigenvalue problem for hydrogen atom in D-dimensional case\ne2\nP2\n\u03a8 = E\u03a8\n\u2212\n2m R\n!\n\n(2)\n\nwhere operators of position Xi and momentum Pi satisfy deformed commutation relation\n(1), R =\n\nq\n\n2\n\u03a3D\ni=1 Xi .\n\nWe use the following representation that satisfies the algebra (1) in the first order in \u03b2,\n\u03b2\u2032\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n\nXi = xi +\nP i = pi +\n\n2\u03b2\u2212\u03b2 \u2032\n(xi p2\n4\n\u03b2\u2032\np p2 ;\n2 i\n\n+ p2 xi ) ,\n\n(3)\n\n2\nwhere p2 = \u03a3D\nk=1 pk and operators xi , pi obey canonical commutation relations [xi , pj ] = ih\u0304\u03b4ij .\n\nFor the undeformed Heisenberg algebra the position representation may be taken: xi = xi ,\npi = ih\u0304 \u2202x\u2202 i .\nWe write Hamiltonian of equation (2) using representation (3) and taking into account\nonly the first order terms in \u03b2, \u03b2 \u2032\nH=\n\nwhere r =\n\n\u03b2 \u2032 p4\np2\n+\n\u2212r\n2m\n2m\nr2 +\n\ne2\n2\u03b2\u2212\u03b2 \u2032\n2\n\nq\n\n\u0010\n\nr 2 p2\n\n+\n\np2 r 2\n\n2\n\n+ h\u0304 D\n\n(4)\n\n\u0011\n\n2\n\u03a3D\ni=1 xi and D is the dimension of space.\n\nExpanding the inverse distance R\u22121 in the series over parameters of deformation up to\nthe first order \u03b2, \u03b2 \u2032 we have\np2\n\u03b2 \u2032 p4\n1 2\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b2 \u2032\n+\n\u2212 e2\n\u2212\nH=\n2m\n2m\nr\n4\n\n1 2\n1 h\u03042 (D \u2212 1)\np + p2 +\nr\nr\nr3\n\n!!\n\n(5)\n\nThis Hamiltonian contains correction of first order over \u03b2, \u03b2 \u2032 to undeformed hydrogen atom\nHamiltonian.\n(1)\n\nNow we can calculate the corrections \u2206Enl to the spectrum using the eigenfunctions of\nundeformed hydrogen atom\n(1)\n\u2206Enl\n\ne2 h\u03042\n= 3 3\nan\n\n(D \u2212 1)(2\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b2 \u2032 ) 2\u03b2 + \u03b2 \u2032 \u03b2 + \u03b2 \u2032\n+\n\u2212\nn\n4l(l + 1)(l + 12 )\nl + 12\n\n!\n\n(6)\n\nwhere a is the Bohr radius and n = n + D\u22123\n, l = l + D\u22123\n, n is the principal quantum number\n2\n2\nand l is the orbital quantum number.\nExpression (6) is in agreement with the results calculated in the paper [12]. It is worth to\nmention that in the special case D = 3 and l = 0 expression (6) gives divergent contribution.\nIt is caused by the term proportional to 1/r 3 in Hamiltonian (5).\n\n\f4\nIII.\n\nMODIFIED PERTURBATION THEORY. CORRECTIONS TO THE\nENERGY OF s-LEVELS IN THREE DIMENSIONAL CASE\n\nIn this section we propose a modified perturbation theory which gives a possibility to\novercome the problem of divergence of the corrections to s-levels in three dimensional case.\nThe idea is to use a shifted expansion of inverse distance R\u22121 which does not contain\ndivergent terms like 1/r 3. So, we rewrite R as follows\nR=\n\nq\n\n2\n\nr 2 + b2 + \u03b1(r 2p2 + p2 r 2 + h\u03042 D \u2212 b )\n\n(7)\n\n2\n\nwhere \u03b1 = (2\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b2 \u2032 )/2 and b2 = \u03b1b . Next we consider the expansion over \u03b1(r 2 p2 + p2 r 2 +\n2\n\nh\u03042 D \u2212 b ) in the vicinity of a new point r 2 + b2 . We will choose the introduced parameter b\nfrom the condition that terms proportional to 1/r 3 are absent in the series.\nIn the first order over \u03b1 we can write\nq\n\n2\n\nr 2 + b2 + \u03b1(r 2 p2 + p2 r 2 + h\u03042 D \u2212 b ) =\n\n\u221a\n\nr 2 + b2 + \u03b1\u0108.\n\n(8)\n\nSquaring left and right hand side of (8) and taking into account only the term of first\norder over \u03b1 we obtain the following equation for operator \u0108\n2\n\nr 2 p2 + p2 r 2 + h\u03042 D \u2212 b = r \u0108 + \u0108r\n\n(9)\n\nIn order to find \u0108 we write the left side of (9) in the following form\n2\n\nr 2 p2 + p2 r 2 + h\u03042 D \u2212 b =\n\n1\nA\nA\nr rp2 + p2 r +\n+ rp2 + p2 r +\nr ,\n2\nr\nr\n\u0012 \u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013 \u0013\n\n(10)\n\n2\n\nwhere parameter A = h\u03042 (D \u2212 1) \u2212 b .\nIt is straightforward to show using (10) that\n1\nA\n\u0108 =\nrp2 + p2 r +\n.\n2\nr\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n(11)\n\nSo we have the following expansion for the distance\nR=\n\n\u221a\n\nr2\n\n+\n\nb2\n\nA\n\u03b1\nrp2 + p2 r +\n.\n+\n2\nr\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n(12)\n\nIt is easy to obtain the inverse distance R\u22121 using (12)\n1\nA\n1\n\u03b1\n1\n\u221a\nrp2 + p2 r +\n=\u221a 2\n\u2212 \u221a 2\n=\n2\n2\n2\nR\nr\nr +b\n2 r +b\nr + b2\n\u0012\n\u0013\nA\n1\n\u03b1 1 2\n21\n\u221a\np +p + 3 .\n=\n\u2212\n2 r\nr r\nr 2 + b2\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n(13)\n\n\f5\n\u221a\nThe contributions 1/ r 2 + b2 in the second term of expansion (13) can be replaced with\n1/r in the linear approximation over \u03b1.

We have already noticed that\ncalculated corrections to the s-levels take place under conditions 2\u03b2 \u2212\u03b2 \u2032 \u2265 0. The conditions\n\nfor the parameters \u03b2, \u03b2 \u2032 restrict the domain of variation for the parameter \u03b7. It is easy to\nverify that\n\n1\n3\n\n\u2264 \u03b7 \u2264 1.

Unit of energy in these figures is the absolute\nvalue of the ground state energy of undeformed hydrogen atom E0 = e2 /2a.\nFinally we can consider constraints on the minimal length. As it was noted [12], the\nbest estimation of the minimal length can be obtained by including the contributions of the\nminimal length effects in the Lamb shift. The experimental Lamb shift for the 1s-level of\n= 8172.837(22) MHz [16] is larger than the best theoretically obtained\nhydrogen atom Lexprt\n1s\nLtheor\n= 8172.731(40) MHz [17]. Assuming similarly as in [12] that the discrepancy between\n1s\nexperimental and theoretical values Lexprt\n\u2212Ltheor\nis entirely attributed to the minimal length\n1s\n1s\n(1)\n\ncorrection \u2206E1s we find upper bound for the minimal length.\nSo having relation (23) we can estimate the minimal length as a function of parameter\n\u03b7. The limit values of the minimal length are \u2206xmin = 1.64 * 10\u221216 m for \u03b7 = 1/3 and\n\n\u2206xmin = 2.86 * 10\u221217 m for \u03b7 = 1. Let us compare our results with the estimation obtained\nin [12] where it was shown that for \u03b7 =\n\n1\n3\n\nthe minimal length (\u2206xmin )\u22121 = 1.75 GeV\n\nor \u2206xmin = 1.13 * 10\u221216 m and for \u03b7 = 1 the minimal length (\u2206xmin )\u22121 = 6.87 GeV or\n\nequivalently \u2206xmin = 2.87 * 10\u221217 m, where 1m = (h\u0304c/e)(eV)\u22121 . The comparison of our\nresults for the minimal length with results obtained in [12] for all values of parameter \u03b7 is\nshown in Fig.3.\nAs on can see our result for energy levels as well as for estimation of the minimal length\n\nare in good agreement with the result obtained in the paper [12], especially for the \u03b7 = 1.\n\n\f7\n\n\u03b7=1/3\n\n-0,997\n\nE1S/E0\n\n-0,998\n\n-0,999\n\n-1,000\n0,00000\n\n0,00025\n\n0,00050\n\n0,00075\n\n0,00100\n\n0,00075\n\n0,00100\n\n2\n\n\u03be\n\n\u03b7=1\n\n-0,980\n\nE1s/E0\n\n-0,985\n\n-0,990\n\n-0,995\n\n-1,000\n0,00000\n\n0,00025\n\n0,00050\n2\n\n\u03be\n\nFIG. 1: Comparison of different results for the energy of 1s states with \u03b7 = 1/3 (upper graph) and\n\u03b7 = 1 (lower graph).

Solid line\nrepresents the results obtained here and dotted line shows the results of [12].\n\nThe discrepancy between these two estimations are caused by the use different methods of\ncomputation. Namely, using modified perturbation theory we have analytical expressions\nfor s-energy levels. The authors of [12] in order to calculate correction to s-levels in three\ndimensional case used cut off procedure and numerical calculation. More detailed comparison\nis made in Discussion.\n\nIV.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nWe study hydrogen atom in the space with deformed Heisenberg algebra leading to nonzero minimal length. The ordinary perturbation theory proposed in [12] leads to the term\nproportional to 1/r 3 in perturbation operator. This term gives a divergent contribution to\nenergy of s-levels in three dimensional case. Therefore, the authors of [12] were forced to\nuse the cut off the expectation value integral h1/r 3i at some point. In order to find the free\nparameter appeared as a result of this procedure the author used the numerical calculation.\nWe construct a modified perturbation theory free of divergences where instead of b2 /r 3\nq\n\u221a\nwe have (1/r \u2212 1/ r 2 + b2 ) with b = h\u0304 (D \u2212 1)(2\u03b2 \u2212 \u03b2 \u2032)/2. It gives us a possibility to\ncalculate analytically corrections to energy levels caused by deformation including s-levels\n\nin three dimensional case. Comparing our result with experimental data from precision\nhydrogen spectroscopy we find that the upper bound for the minimal length is of order\n10\u221216 m, 10\u221217 m. Our results for energy levels as well as the result for estimation of the\n\n\f9\nminimal length are in a good agreement with the results obtained in the paper [12] with\nthe help of numerical calculation and cut off procedure. Note also that for the case \u03b7 = 1/3\n(2\u03b2 = \u03b2 \u2032) our results for energy levels reproduce the result of Brau [11], as it must be.\nFinally, we would like to draw attention to the problem which is ignored in present paper\nas well as in the papers of other authors. Considering hydrogen atom in deformed space\nwe suppose that Coulomb potential is the same as in non deformed space. In fact, in the\ndeformed-space the Coulomb potential as a potential of a point charge might be corrected.\nThis will lead to additional corrections to the energy spectrum of hydrogen atom. It is an\ninteresting problem which worth separate investigations.\n\n[1] D. J. Gross, P. F. Mende, Nucl. Phys. B 303, 407 (1988).\n[2] M. Maggiore, Phys. Lett. B 304, 65 (1993).\n[3] E.
