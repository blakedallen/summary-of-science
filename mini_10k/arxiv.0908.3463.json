The orresponding omputations, termed as prepro essing in the following,\nhave to be performed at the rate of hange of the hannel whi h, depending on the propagation environment, is typi ally mu h lower than the rate at whi h the transmission of a tual data symbols takes pla e.\nNevertheless, as payload data re eived during the prepro essing phase must be stored in a dedi ated bu\u001ber,\nprepro essing represents a major bottlene k in terms of the size of this bu\u001ber and the resulting dete tion\nlaten y [14\u2104.\nIn a very large s ale integration (VLSI) implementation, the straightforward approa h to redu ing the\nprepro essing laten y is to employ parallel pro essing over multiple matrix inversion or QR de omposition\nunits, whi h, however, omes at the ost of in reased sili on area. In [1\u2104, the problem of redu ing prepro essing omplexity in linear MIMO-OFDM re eivers is addressed on an algorithmi level by formulating e\u001e ient\ninterpolation-based algorithms for matrix inversion that take the polynomial nature of the MIMO-OFDM\nhannel matrix expli itly into a ount.

Laurent Polynomials and Interpolation\nIn the remainder of the paper, the term interpolation indi ates LP interpolation, as presented in this\nse tion. Interpolation is a entral omponent of the algorithms for e\u001e ient QR de omposition of polynomial\nmatri es presented in Se tions 5 and 7. In the following, we review basi results on interpolation and\nestablish the orresponding notation. In Se tion 8, we will present various strategies for omputationally\ne\u001e ient interpolation tailored to the problem at hand.\n\nDe\u001cnition 3.\n\nGiven a matrix-valued fun tion A : U \u2192 CP \u00d7M and integers V1 , V2 \u2265 0, the notation\n\nA(s) \u223c (V1 , V2 ) indi ates that there exist oe\u001e ient matri es Av \u2208 CP \u00d7M , v = \u2212V1 , \u2212V1 + 1, . . . , V2 , su h\n\nthat\n\nA(s) =\n\nV2\nX\n\nAv s\u2212v ,\n\nv=\u2212V1\n\n(5)\n\ns \u2208 U.\n\nIf A(s) \u223c (V1 , V2 ), then A(s) is a Laurent polynomial (LP) matrix with maximum degree V1 + V2 .\nBefore dis ussing interpolation, we brie\u001dy list the following statements whi h follow dire tly from Definition 3.

Problem Statement\n3.1. MIMO-OFDM System Model\nWe onsider a MIMO system [13\u2104 with MT transmit and MR re eive antennas. Throughout the paper,\nwe fo us on the ase MR \u2265 MT . The matrix-valued impulse response of the frequen y-sele tive MIMO\n\nhannel is given by the taps Hl \u2208 CMR \u00d7MT (l = 0, 1, . . . , L) with the orresponding matrix-valued transfer\n\nfun tion\n\nL\n\u0001 X\nH ej2\u03c0\u03b8 =\nHl e\u2212j2\u03c0l\u03b8 ,\nl=0\n\n0\u2264\u03b8<1\n\nwhi h satis\u001ces H(s) \u223c (0, L). In a MIMO-OFDM system with N OFDM tones and a y li pre\u001cx of length\nLCP \u2265 L samples, the equivalent input-output relation for the nth tone is given by\n\u0001\ndn = H sn cn + wn ,\n\n7\n\nn = 0, 1, . . . , N \u2212 1\n\n\fwith the transmit signal ve tor cn , [cn,1 cn,2 * * * cn,MT ]T, the re eive signal ve tor dn , [dn,1 dn,2 * * * dn,MR ]T,\n\nthe additive noise ve tor wn , and sn , ej2\u03c0n/N. Here, cn,m stands for the omplex-valued data symbol,\ntaken from a \u001cnite onstellation O, transmitted by the mth antenna on the nth tone and dn,m is the signal\n\nobserved at the mth re eive antenna on the nth tone. For n = 0, 1, . . . , N \u2212 1, we assume that cn ontains\nstatisti ally independent entries and satis\u001ces E[cn ] = 0 and E[cH\nn cn ] = 1. Again for n = 0, 1, . . . , N \u2212 1, we\n\nassume that wn is statisti ally independent of cn and ontains entries that are independent and identi ally\n\n2\n2\ndistributed (i.i.d.) as CN (0, \u03c3w\n), where \u03c3w\ndenotes the noise varian e and is assumed to be known at the\n\nre eiver.\n\nIn pra ti e, N is typi ally hosen to be a power of two in order to allow for e\u001e ient OFDM pro essing\nbased on the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Moreover, a small subset of the N tones is typi ally set aside for\npilot symbols and virtual tones at the frequen y band edges, whi h help to redu e out-of-band interferen e\nand relax the pulse-shaping \u001clter requirements. We olle t the indi es orresponding to the D tones arrying\npayload data into the set D \u2286 {0, 1, . . . , N \u2212 1}. Typi al OFDM systems have D \u2265 3LCP .\n3.2. QR De omposition in MIMO-OFDM Dete tors\nWidely used algorithms for oherent dete tion in MIMO-OFDM systems in lude su essive an elation (SC) dete tors [13\u2104, both zero-for ing (ZF) and MMSE [21, 8\u2104, and sphere de oders, both in the original\nformulation [5, 17\u2104 requiring ZF-based prepro essing, as well as in the MMSE-based form proposed in [16\u2104.\nThese dete tion algorithms require QR de omposition in the prepro essing step, or, more spe i\u001c ally, omputation of matri es Q(sn ) and R(sn ), for all n \u2208 D, de\u001cned as follows. In the ZF ase, Q(sn ) and R(sn )\n\nare QR fa tors of H(sn ), whereas in the MMSE ase, Q(sn ) and R(sn ) are obtained as follows: Q\u0304(sn )R(sn )\nis the unique QR de omposition of the full-rank, (MR + MT ) \u00d7 MT MMSE-augmented hannel matrix\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\n\u0001\nH(sn )\n\uf8fb\n(9)\nH\u0304 sn , \uf8f0 \u221a\nMT \u03c3w IMT\n\nand Q(sn ) is given by Q\u03041,MR (sn ). Taking the \u001crst MR rows on both sides of the equation H\u0304(sn ) =\nQ\u0304(sn )R(sn ) yields the fa torization H(sn ) = Q(sn )R(sn ), whi h is unique be ause of the uniqueness of\nQ\u0304(sn ) and R(sn ), and whi h we all the MMSE-QR de omposition of H(sn ) with the MMSE-QR fa tors\nQ(sn ) and R(sn ).\n\nIn the following, we brie\u001dy des ribe how Q(sn ) and R(sn ), either derived as QR de omposition or\nas MMSE-QR de omposition of H(sn ), are used in the dete tion algorithms listed above. SC dete tors\nessentially solve the linear system of equations QH (sn )dn = R(sn )\u0109n by ba k-substitution (with rounding\nof the intermediate results to elements of O [13\u2104) to obtain \u0109n \u2208 OMT. Sphere de oders exploit the upper\n\ntriangularity of R(sn ) to \u001cnd the symbol ve tor \u0109n \u2208 OMT that minimizes kQH (sn )dn \u2212 R(sn )\u0109n k2 through\nan e\u001e ient tree sear h [17\u2104.\n\n8\n\n\f3.3. Problem Statement\nWe assume that the MIMO-OFDM re eiver has perfe t knowledge of the samples H(sn ) for n \u2208 E \u2286\n\n{0, 1, . . . , N \u2212 1}, with |E| \u2265 L + 1, from whi h H(sn ) an be obtained at any data- arrying tone n \u2208 D\n\nthrough interpolation of H(s) \u223c (0, L). We note that interpolation of H(s) is not ne essary if D \u2286 E . We\n\nnext formulate the problem statement by fo using on ZF-based dete tors, whi h require QR de omposition\nof the MIMO-OFDM hannel matri es H(sn ). The problem statement for the MMSE ase is analogous with\n\nQR de omposition repla ed by MMSE-QR de omposition.\nThe MIMO-OFDM re eiver needs to ompute QR fa tors Q(sn ) and R(sn ) of H(sn ) for all data- arrying\ntones n \u2208 D. A straightforward approa h to solving this problem onsists of \u001crst interpolating H(s) to ob-\n\ntain H(sn ) at the tones n \u2208 D and then performing QR de omposition on a per-tone basis. This method\n\nwill hen eforth be alled brute-for e per-tone QR de omposition. The interpolation-based QR de omposition\nalgorithms presented in this paper are motivated by the following observations. First, performing QR de omposition on an M \u00d7 M matrix requires O(M 3 ) arithmeti operations [6\u2104, whereas the number of arithmeti\n\noperations involved in omputing one sample of an M \u00d7 M LP matrix by interpolation is proportional to\n\nthe number of matrix entries M 2 , as interpolation of an LP matrix is performed entrywise. This omparison\nsuggests that we may obtain fundamental savings in omputational omplexity by repla ing QR de omposition by interpolation. Se ond, onsider a \u001dat-fading hannel, so that L = 0 and hen e H(sn ) = H0 for all\nn = 0, 1, . . . , N \u2212 1. In this ase, a single QR de omposition H0 = QR yields QR fa tors of H(sn ) for all\n\ndata- arrying tones n \u2208 D. A question that now arises naturally is whether for L > 0 QR fa tors Q(sn )\nand R(sn ), n \u2208 D, an be obtained from a smaller set of QR fa tors through interpolation. We will see that\n\nthe answer is in the a\u001ermative and will, moreover, demonstrate that interpolation-based QR de omposition\nalgorithms an yield signi\u001c ant omputational omplexity savings over brute-for e per-tone QR de omposition for a wide range of values of the parameters MT , MR , L, N , and D, whi h will be referred to as\nthe system parameters throughout the paper. The key to formulating interpolation-based algorithms and\nrealizing these omplexity savings is a result on QR de omposition of LP matri es formalized in Theorem 9\nin the next se tion.\n\n4. QR De omposition through Interpolation\n4.1. Additional Properties of QR De omposition\nWe next set the stage for the formulation of our main te hni al result by presenting additional properties\nof QR de omposition of a matrix A \u2208 CP \u00d7M, with P \u2265 M , that are dire tly implied by De\u001cnition 1.\n\nProposition 5.\n\nLet A = QR be a QR de omposition of A. Then, for a given k \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , M }, A1,k =\n\nQ1,k R1,k\n1,k is a QR de omposition of A1,k .\n\n9\n\n\fk+1,M\nProof. From A = QR it follows that A1,k = (QR)1,k = Q1,k R1,k\n, whi h simpli\u001ces to\n1,k + Qk+1,M R1,k\n1,k\nA1,k = Q1,k R1,k\n, sin e the upper triangularity of R implies Rk+1,M\n= 0. Q1,k and R1,k\n1,k\n1,k satisfy Conditions 1\n\nand 2 of De\u001cnition 1 sin e all olumns of Q1,k are also olumns of Q and sin e R1,k\n1,k is a prin ipal submatrix\n1,k\nH\nH\nof R, respe tively. Finally, R = QH A implies R1,k\n1,k = (Q A)1,k = Q1,k A1,k and hen e Condition 3 of\n\nDe\u001cnition 1 is satis\u001ced.\n\nProposition 6.\n\nLet A = QR be a QR de omposition of A. Then, for M > 1 and for a given k \u2208\n\nk,M\n1,k\u22121\n{2, 3, . . . , M }, Ak,M \u2212 Q1,k\u22121 R1,k\u22121\nk,M = Qk,M Rk,M is a QR de omposition of Ak,M \u2212 Q1,k\u22121 Rk,M .\n\nk,M\nProof. A = Q1,k\u22121 R1,k\u22121 + Qk,M Rk,M implies Ak,M = Q1,k\u22121 R1,k\u22121\nk,M + Qk,M Rk,M and hen e Ak,M \u2212\n\nk,M\nk,M\nQ1,k\u22121 R1,k\u22121\nk,M = Qk,M Rk,M . Qk,M and Rk,M satisfy Conditions 1 and 2 of De\u001cnition 1 sin e all olumns\n\nof Qk,M are also olumns of Q and sin e Rk,M\nk,M is a prin ipal submatrix of R, respe tively. Moreover,\nk,M\nH\nH\nH\nR = QH A implies Rk,M\nk,M = (Q A)k,M = Qk,M Ak,M . Using Qk,M Q1,k\u22121 = 0, whi h follows from the fa t\n1,k\u22121\nH\nH\nthat the nonzero olumns of Q are orthonormal, we an write Rk,M\nk,M = Qk,M Ak,M \u2212 Qk,M Q1,k\u22121 Rk,M =\n1,k\u22121\nQH\nk,M (Ak,M \u2212 Q1,k\u22121 Rk,M ). Hen e, Condition 3 of De\u001cnition 1 is satis\u001ced.\n\nIn order to hara terize QR de omposition of A in the general ase rank(A) \u2264 M , we introdu e the\n\nfollowing on ept.\n\nDe\u001cnition 7.\n\nThe ordered olumn rank of A is the number\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f20,\nK,\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3max{k \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , M } : rank(A1,k ) = k},\n\nrank(A1,1 ) = 0\n\nelse.\n\nFor later use, we note that K = 0 is equivalent to a1 = 0, and that K < M is equivalent to A being\nrank-de\u001c ient.\n\nProposition 8.\n\nQR fa tors Q and R of a matrix A of ordered olumn rank K > 0 satisfy the following\n\nproperties:\n1. QH\n1,K Q1,K = IK\n2. [R]k,k > 0 for k = 1, 2, . . . , K\n3. Q1,K and R1,K are unique\n4. ran(Q1,k ) = ran(A1,k ) for k = 1, 2, . . . , K\n5. if K < M , [R]K+1,K+1 = 0\nProof. Sin e Q1,K and R1,K\n1,K are QR fa tors of A1,K , as stated in Proposition 5, and sin e rank(A1,K ) = K ,\nProperties 1 and 2, as well as the uniqueness of Q1,K stated in Property 3, are obtained dire tly by applying\nProposition 2 to the full-rank matrix A1,K . The uniqueness of R1,K stated in Property 3 is implied by\nthe uniqueness of Q1,K and by R1,K = QH\n1,K A, whi h follows from Condition 3 of De\u001cnition 1. For\n10\n\n\f1,k\nk = 1, 2, . . . , K , ran(Q1,k ) = ran(A1,k ) is a trivial onsequen e of A1,k = Q1,k R1,k\n1,k and of rank(R1,k ) = k ,\n\nwhi h follows from the fa t that R1,k\n1,k is upper triangular with nonzero entries on its main diagonal. This\nproves Property 4. If K < M , Condition 3 of De\u001cnition 1 implies [R]K+1,K+1 = qH\nK+1 aK+1 . If qK+1 = 0,\n[R]K+1,K+1 = 0 follows trivially. If qK+1 6= 0, Condition 1 of De\u001cnition 1 implies that qK+1 is orthogonal\n\nto ran(Q1,K ), whereas the de\u001cnition of K implies that aK+1 \u2208 ran(A1,K ). Sin e ran(Q1,K ) = ran(A1,K ),\n\nwe obtain qH\nK+1 aK+1 = [R]K+1,K+1 = 0, whi h proves Property 5.\n\nWe emphasize that for K > 0, the uniqueness of Q1,K and R1,K has two signi\u001c ant onsequen es. First,\nthe GS orthonormalization pro edure (1)\u0015(3), evaluated for k = 1, 2, . . . , K , determines the submatri es\nQ1,K and R1,K of the matri es Q and R produ ed by any QR de omposition algorithm. Se ond, the\n\nnonuniqueness of Q and R in the ase of rank-de\u001c ient A, demonstrated in Se tion 2.2, is restri ted to the\nsubmatri es QK+1,M and RK+1,M.\nFinally, we note that Property 5 of Proposition 8 is valid for the ase K = 0 as well. In fa t, Condition 3\nof De\u001cnition 1 implies [R]1,1 = qH\n1 a1 . Sin e K = 0 implies a1 = 0, we immediately obtain [R]1,1 = 0.\n4.2. QR De omposition of an LP Matrix\nIn the remainder of Se tion 4, we onsider a P \u00d7 M LP matrix A(s) \u223c (V1 , V2 ), s \u2208 U , with P \u2265 M , and\n\nQR fa tors Q(s) and R(s) of A(s). Despite A(s) being an LP matrix, Q(s) and R(s) will, in general, not be\n\nLP matri es. To see this, onsider the ase where rank(A(s)) = M for all s \u2208 U . It follows from the results\nin Se tions 2.2 and 4.1 that, in this ase, Q(s) and R(s) are unique and determined through (1)\u0015(3). The\n\ndivision and the square root operation in (2), in general, prevent Q(s), and hen e also R(s) = QH (s)A(s),\nfrom being LP matri es. Nevertheless, in this se tion we will show that there exists a mapping M that\ntransforms Q(s) and R(s) into orresponding LP matri es Q\u0303(s) and R\u0303(s). The mapping M onstitutes the\nbasis for the formulation of interpolation-based QR de omposition algorithms for MIMO-OFDM systems.\n\nIn the following, we onsider QR fa tors of A(s0 ) for a given s0 \u2208 U . In order to keep the notation\n\nompa t, we omit the dependen e of all involved quantities on s0 . We start by de\u001cning the auxiliary\nvariables \u2206k as\n\u2206k , \u2206k\u22121 [R]2k,k ,\n\nk = 1, 2, . . . , M\n\n(10)\n\nwith \u22060 , 1. Next, we introdu e the ve tors\nq\u0303k , \u2206k\u22121 [R]k,k qk ,\n\nk = 1, 2, . . . , M\n\n(11)\n\nr\u0303Tk , \u2206k\u22121 [R]k,k rTk ,\n\nk = 1, 2, . . . , M\n\n(12)\n\nand de\u001cne the mapping M : (Q, R) 7\u2192 (Q\u0303, R\u0303) by Q\u0303 , [q\u03031 q\u03032 * * * q\u0303M ] and R\u0303 , [r\u03031 r\u03032 * * * r\u0303M ]T.\n\nNow, we onsider the ordered olumn rank K of A, and note that Property 2 in Proposition 8 implies\n\nthat, if K > 0, \u2206k\u22121 [R]k,k > 0 for k = 1, 2, . . . , K , as seen by unfolding the re ursion in (10). Hen e, for\n11\n\n\fK > 0 and k = 1, 2, . . . , K , we an ompute qk and rTk from q\u0303k and r\u0303Tk , respe tively, a ording to\nqk = (\u2206k\u22121 [R]k,k )\u22121 q\u0303k\n\n(13)\n\nrTk = (\u2206k\u22121 [R]k,k )\u22121 r\u0303Tk\n\n(14)\n\nwhere \u2206k\u22121 [R]k,k is obtained from the entries on the main diagonal of R\u0303 as\n\uf8f1q\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 [R\u0303]k,k ,\nk=1\n\u2206k\u22121 [R]k,k = q\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 [R\u0303]k\u22121,k\u22121 [R\u0303]k,k ,\nk = 2, 3, . . . , K.\n\n(15)\n\nIf K = M , i.e., for full-rank A, we have \u2206k\u22121 [R]k,k 6= 0 for all k = 1, 2, . . . , M , and the mapping M is\n\ninvertible. In the ase K < M , Property 5 in Proposition 8 states that [R]K+1,K+1 = 0, whi h ombined\n\nwith (10)\u0015(12) implies that \u2206k = 0, q\u0303k = 0, and r\u0303Tk = 0 for k = K + 1, K + 2, . . . , M . Hen e, the\nmapping M is not invertible for K < M , sin e the information ontained in QK+1,M and RK+1,M an\n\nnot be extra ted from Q\u0303K+1,M = 0 and R\u0303K+1,M = 0. Nevertheless, we an re over QK+1,M and RK+1,M\n\nas follows. For 0 < K < M , setting k = K + 1 in Proposition 6 shows that QK+1,M and RK+1,M\nK+1,M an\nK+1,M\nbe obtained by QR de omposition of AK+1,M \u2212 Q1,K R1,K\nis obtained as RK+1,M =\nK+1,M . Then, R\n\n[ RK+1,M\n1,K\n\nK+1,M\n\n] with R1,K\nRK+1,M\nK+1,M\n\n= 0 be ause of the upper triangularity of R. For K = 0, sin e Q\u0303 and R\u0303\n\nare all-zero matri es, QK+1,M = Q and RK+1,M\nK+1,M = R must be obtained by performing QR de omposition\non A. In the remainder of the paper, we denote by inverse mapping M\u22121 : (Q\u0303, R\u0303) 7\u2192 (Q, R) the pro edure1\n\nformulated in the following steps:\n\n1. If K > 0, for k = 1, 2, . . . , K , ompute the s aling fa tor (\u2206k\u22121 [R]k,k )\u22121 using (15) and s ale q\u0303k\nand r\u0303Tk a ording to (13) and (14), respe tively.\n2.

If K = 0, ompute Q and R by performing QR de omposition on A.\nWe note that the nonuniqueness of QR de omposition in the ase K < M has the following onsequen e.\nGiven QR fa tors Q1 and R1 of A, the appli ation of the mapping M to (Q1 , R1 ) followed by appli ation\nof the inverse mapping M\u22121 yields matri es Q2 and R2 that may not be equal to Q1 and R1 , respe tively.\n\nHowever, Q2 and R2 are QR fa tors of A in the sense of De\u001cnition 1.\n\nWe are now ready to present the main te hni al result of this paper. This result paves the way for the\nformulation of interpolation-based QR de omposition algorithms.\n\nTheorem 9.\n\nGiven A : U \u2192 CP \u00d7M with P \u2265 M , su h that A(s) \u223c (V1 , V2 ) with maximum degree\n\nV = V1 + V2 . The fun tions \u2206k (s), q\u0303k (s), and r\u0303Tk (s), obtained by applying the mapping M as in (10)\u0015(12)\n\nto QR fa tors Q(s) and R(s) of A(s) for all s \u2208 U , satisfy the following properties:\n1\n\nNote that for K < M , the inverse mapping M\u22121 requires expli it knowledge of AK+1,M .\n\n12\n\n\f1. \u2206k (s) \u223c (kV, kV )\n\n2. q\u0303k (s) \u223c ((k \u2212 1)V + V1 , (k \u2212 1)V + V2 )\n3. r\u0303Tk (s) \u223c (kV, kV ) .\n\nWe emphasize that Theorem 9 applies to any QR fa tors satisfying De\u001cnition 1 and is therefore not\na\u001be ted by the nonuniqueness of QR de omposition arising in the rank-de\u001c ient ase.\nBefore pro eeding to the proof, we note that Theorem 9 implies that the maximum degrees of the\nLP matri es Q\u0303(s) and R\u0303(s) are (2M \u2212 1)V and 2M V , respe tively. We an therefore on lude that 2M V + 1\nbase points are enough for interpolation of both Q\u0303(s) and R\u0303(s). We mention that the results presented in [4\u2104,\n\nin the ontext of narrowband MIMO systems, involving a QR de omposition algorithm that avoids divisions\nand square root operations, an be applied to the problem at hand as well. This leads to an alternative\nmapping of Q(s) and R(s) to LP matri es with maximum degrees signi\u001c antly higher than 2M V .\n4.3. Proof of Theorem 9\nThe proof onsists of three steps, summarized as follows. In Step 1, we fo us on a given s0 \u2208 U and\n\naim at writing \u2206k (s0 ), q\u0303k (s0 ), and r\u0303Tk (s0 ) as fun tions of A(s0 ) for all (K(s0 ), k) \u2208 K , {0, 1, . . . , M } \u00d7\n\n{1, 2, . . . , M }, where K(s0 ) denotes the ordered olumn rank of A(s0 ). Step 1 is split into Steps 1a and 1b,\n\nin whi h the two disjoint subsets K1 , {(K \u2032 , k \u2032 ) \u2208 K : 0 < K \u2032 \u2264 M, 1 \u2264 k \u2032 \u2264 K \u2032 } and K2 , {(K \u2032 , k \u2032 ) \u2208 K :\n0 \u2264 K \u2032 < M, K \u2032 + 1 \u2264 k \u2032 \u2264 M } (with K1 \u222a K2 = K) are onsidered, respe tively. In Step 1a, we note that\n\nfor (K(s0 ), k) \u2208 K1 , Q1,K(s0 ) (s0 ) and R1,K(s0 ) (s0 ) are unique and an be obtained by evaluating (1)\u0015(3)\nfor k = 1, 2, . . . , K(s0 ). By unfolding the re ursions in (1)\u0015(3) and in (10)\u0015(12), we write \u2206k (s0 ), q\u0303k (s0 ),\n\nand r\u0303Tk (s0 ) as fun tions of A(s0 ) for (K(s0 ), k) \u2208 K1 . In Step 1b, we show that the expressions for \u2206k (s0 ),\n\nq\u0303k (s0 ), and r\u0303Tk (s0 ), derived in Step 1a for (K(s0 ), k) \u2208 K1 , are also valid for (K(s0 ), k) \u2208 K2 and hen e, as\n\na onsequen e of K1 \u222a K2 = K, for all (K(s0 ), k) \u2208 K. In Step 2, we note that the derivations in Step 1\narry over to all s0 \u2208 U , and generalize the expressions obtained in Step 1 to expressions for \u2206k (s), q\u0303k (s),\n\nand r\u0303Tk (s) that hold for k = 1, 2, . . . , M and for all s \u2208 U . Making use of A(s) \u223c (V1 , V2 ), in Step 3 it is\n\n\u001cnally shown that \u2206k (s), q\u0303k (s), and r\u0303Tk (s) satisfy Properties 1\u00153 in the statement of Theorem 9.\n\nStep 1a. Throughout Steps 1a and 1b, in order to simplify the notation, we drop the dependen e of all\nquantities on s0 . In Step 1a, we assume that (K, k) \u2208 K1 and, unless stated otherwise, all equations and\nstatements involving k are valid for all k = 1, 2, . . . , K .\n\nWe start by listing preparatory results. We re all from Se tion 4.1 that the submatri es Q1,K and R1,K are\nunique and that, onsequently, qk and rTk are determined by (1)\u0015(3). From qk 6= 0, implied by Property 1\n\nin Proposition 8, and from (2) we dedu e that yk 6= 0. Then, from (1) and (2) we obtain\nykH yk = ykH ak \u2212\n\nk\u22121\nX\n\nqH\ni ak\n\ni=1\n\n13\n\nq\nH\nykH yk qH\nk qi = yk ak\n\n(16)\n\n\fas qH\nk qi = 0 for i = 1, 2, . . . , k \u2212 1. Consequently, we an write [R]k,k , using (2) and (3), as\nykH ak\nq\n=\n[R]k,k = qH\na\n=\nk\nk\nykH yk\n\nq\nykH yk\n\n(17)\n\nthus implying [R]k,k qk = yk and hen e, by (11),\n(18)\n\nq\u0303k = \u2206k\u22121 yk .\n\nFurthermore, using (10) and (17), we an write \u2206k = \u2206k\u22121 ykH yk or alternatively, in re ursion-free form,\n\u2206k =\n\nk\nY\n\n(19)\n\nyiH yi .\n\ni=1\n\nNext, we note that (1) implies\nyk = ak +\n\nk\u22121\nX\n\n(k)\n\n(20)\n\n\u03b1i ai\n\ni=1\n\n(k)\n\nwith unique oe\u001e ients \u03b1i , i = 1, 2, . . . , k \u2212 1, sin e y1 = a1 and sin e for k > 1, we have rank(A1,k\u22121 ) =\n\nk \u2212 1 and, as stated in Property 4 of Proposition 8, ran(Q1,k\u22121 ) = ran(A1,k\u22121 ). Next, we onsider the\n\nrelation between {a1 , a2 , . . . , ak } and {y1 , y2 , . . . , yk }.

Next, for k > 1 we denote by A1,k\\i the matrix obtained by removing\n(k)\n\nthe ith olumn of A1,k , and we express \u0393k,i as a fun tion of a1 , a2 , . . . , ak a ording to\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\ny1H A1,k\\i\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef H\ny\nA\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n1,k\\i\n2\n(k)\nk+i\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n\u0393k,i = (\u22121)\ndet\uf8ef\n..\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n.\n\uf8fb\n\uf8f0\nH\nyk\u22121\nA1,k\\i\n\n= (\u22121)k+i det AH\n1,k\u22121 A1,k\\i\n\n\u0001\n\nwhere the last equality is derived analogously to (26) and (27). Thus, (30) an be written as\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2ak ,\nk=1\nq\u0303k =\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3Pk (\u22121)k+i det(AH\nk > 1.\n1,k\u22121 A1,k\\i )ai ,\ni=1\n16\n\n(31)\n\n\fFinally, we obtain\nr\u0303Tk = q\u0303H\nk A\n\n(32)\n\nas implied by (3), (11), and (12). The results of Step 1a are the relations (27), (31), and (32), whi h are\nvalid for (K, k) \u2208 K1 .\nStep 1b. We next show that (27), (31), and (32) hold for (K, k) \u2208 K2 as well. Throughout Step 1b we\nassume that (K, k) \u2208 K2 , and, unless spe i\u001ced otherwise, all equations and statements involving k are valid\nfor k = K + 1, K + 2, . . . , M . We know from Se tion 4.1 that [R]K+1,K+1 = 0. A ording to the de\u001cnition\n\nof M, [R]K+1,K+1 = 0 implies \u2206k = 0, q\u0303k = 0, and r\u0303Tk = 0. It is therefore to be shown that the RHS\n\nof (27) evaluates to zero, and that the RHS expressions of (31) and (32) evaluate to all-zero ve tors. We\n\nstart by noting that sin e k > K , A1,k is rank-de\u001c ient. Sin e rank(AH\n1,k A1,k ) = rank(A1,k ) < k , we obtain\nthat det(AH\n1,k A1,k ) on the RHS of (27) evaluates to zero. Next, for k > max(K, 1), the expression\nk\nX\n\u0001\n(\u22121)k+i det AH\n1,k\u22121 A1,k\\i ai\n\n(33)\n\ni=1\n\non the RHS of (31) is a ve tor whose pth omponent an be written, by inverse Lapla e expansion [9\u2104, as\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\nk\nH\nH\nH\nX\n\u0001\nA\na\nA\na\n*\n*\n*\nA\na\n1,k\u22121 2\n1,k\u22121 k \uf8fb\n\uf8f0 1,k\u22121 1\n(\u22121)k+i det AH\n(34)\n1,k\u22121 A1,k\\i [A]p,i = det\n[A]p,1\n[A]p,2\n***\n[A]p,k\ni=1\nfor all p = 1, 2, . . . , P . Now, again for k > max(K, 1), sin e A1,k is rank-de\u001c ient, ak an be written as a\nlinear ombination\nak =\n\nk\u22121\nX\n\n\u2032\n\n\u03b2 (k ) ak\u2032\n\nk\u2032 =1\n\n(for some oe\u001e ients \u03b2\n\n(k\u2032 )\n\n, k = 1, 2, . . . , k \u2212 1) whi h implies that, for all p = 1, 2, . . . , P , the argument of\n\u2032\n\nthe determinant on the RHS of (34) has\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\nk\u22121\nH\nX\n\u2032\nAH\na\nA\na\n\u2032\n1,k\u22121 k \uf8fb\n\uf8f0 1,k\u22121 k \uf8fb =\n\u03b2 (k ) \uf8f0\n[A]p,k\n[A]p,k\u2032\nk\u2032 =1\n\nas its last olumn. Sin e this olumn is a linear ombination of the \u001crst k \u2212 1 olumns, the determinant\non the RHS of (34) is equal to zero for all p = 1, 2, . . . , P , and hen e the expression in (33) is equal to an\n\nall-zero ve tor for k > max(K, 1). Moreover, if K = 0 and k = 1, we have a1 = 0 on the RHS of (31).\nHen e, the RHS of (31) evaluates to an all-zero ve tor for all (K, k) \u2208 K2 . Thus, (31) simpli\u001ces to q\u0303k = 0,\n\nwhi h in turn implies that the RHS of (32) evaluates to an all-zero ve tor as well. We have therefore shown\nthat (27), (31), and (32) hold for (K, k) \u2208 K2 . Finally, sin e K1 \u222a K2 = K, the results of Steps 1a and 1b\nimply that (27), (31), and (32) are valid for (K, k) \u2208 K.\n17\n\n\fStep 2. We note that the derivations presented in Steps 1a and 1b for a given s0 \u2208 U do not depend on s0\nand an hen e be arried over to all s0 \u2208 U . Thus, we an rewrite (27), (31), and (32), respe tively, as\n\u0001\n\u2206k (s) = det AH\n1,k (s)A1,k (s)\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2ak (s),\nq\u0303k (s) =\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3Pk (\u22121)k+i det(AH\n1,k\u22121 (s)A1,k\\i (s))ai (s),\ni=1\n\n(35)\nk=1\n\n(36)\n\nk>1\n\nr\u0303Tk (s) = q\u0303H\nk (s)A(s)\n\n(37)\n\nfor k = 1, 2, . . . , M and s \u2208 U .\nStep 3. For k = 1, 2, . . . , M , we note that A(s) \u223c (V1 , V2 ), along with V = V1 +V2 , implies AH\n1,k (s)A1,k (s) \u223c\n\n(V, V ). Now, the determinant on the RHS of (35) an be expressed through Lapla e expansion as a sum of\n\nprodu ts of k entries of AH\n1,k (s)A1,k (s) \u223c (V, V ). Therefore, we get \u2206k (s) \u223c (kV, kV ) for k = 1, 2, . . . , M .\n\nAnalogously, for k = 2, 3, . . . , M we obtain det(AH\n1,k\u22121 (s)A1,k\\i (s)) \u223c ((k \u2212 1)V, (k \u2212 1)V ).\n\nThe lat-\n\nter result, ombined with A(s) \u223c (V1 , V2 ) in (36) yields q\u0303k (s) \u223c ((k \u2212 1)V + V1 , (k \u2212 1)V + V2 ), whi h\nholds for k = 1 as well as a trivial onsequen e of (36) and A(s) \u223c (V1 , V2 ). Finally, from q\u0303k (s) \u223c\n\n((k \u2212 1)V + V1 , (k \u2212 1)V + V2 ) and (37), using A(s) \u223c (V1 , V2 ) and V = V1 +V2 , we obtain r\u0303Tk (s) \u223c (kV, kV )\n\nfor k = 1, 2, . . . , M .\n\n5. Appli ation to MIMO-OFDM\nWe are now ready to show how the results derived in the previous se tion lead to algorithms that\nexploit the polynomial nature of the MIMO hannel transfer fun tion H(s) \u223c (0, L) to perform e\u001e ient\ninterpolation-based omputation of QR fa tors of H(sn ), for all n \u2208 D, given knowledge of H(sn ) for n \u2208 E .\n\nWe note that the algorithms des ribed in the following apply to QR de omposition of generi polynomial\nmatri es that are oversampled on the unit ir le.\nWithin the algorithms to be presented, interpolation involves base points and target points on U that\n\norrespond to OFDM tones indexed by integers taken from the set {0, 1, . . . , N \u2212 1}. For a given set\n\nX \u2286 {0, 1, . . . , N \u2212 1} of OFDM tones, we de\u001cne S(X ) , {sn : n \u2208 X } to denote the set of orresponding\n\npoints on U. With this de\u001cnition in pla e, we start by summarizing the brute-for e approa h des ribed in\n\nSe tion 3.3.\n\nAlgorithm I: Brute-for e per-tone QR de omposition\n1. Interpolate H(s) from S(E) to S(D).\n\n2. For ea h n \u2208 D, perform QR de omposition on H(sn ) to obtain Q(sn ) and R(sn ).\nIt is obvious that for large D, performing QR de omposition on a per-tone basis will result in high\nomputational omplexity. However, in the pra ti ally relevant ase L \u226a D the OFDM system e\u001be tively\n18\n\n\fhighly oversamples the MIMO hannel's transfer fun tion, so that H(sn ) hanges slowly a ross n. This\nobservation, ombined with the results in Se tion 4, onstitutes the basis for a new lass of algorithms\nthat perform QR de omposition at a small number of tones and obtain the remaining QR fa tors through\ninterpolation. More spe i\u001c ally, the basi idea of interpolation-based QR de omposition is as follows. By\napplying Theorem 9 to the MR \u00d7 MT LP matrix H(s) \u223c (0, L), we obtain q\u0303k (s) \u223c ((k \u2212 1)L, kL) and\n\nr\u0303Tk (s) \u223c (kL, kL) for k = 1, 2, . . . , MT . In order to simplify the exposition, in the remainder of the paper we\n\nonsider q\u0303k (s) as satisfying q\u0303k (s) \u223c (kL, kL). The resulting statements\nq\u0303k (s), r\u0303Tk (s) \u223c (kL, kL) ,\n\nk = 1, 2, . . . , MT\n\n(38)\n\nimply that both q\u0303k (s) and r\u0303Tk (s) an be interpolated from at least 2kL + 1 base points, and that, as a onsequen e of V1 = V2 = kL, the orresponding interpolation matri es are real-valued. For k = 1, 2, . . . , MT ,\nthe interpolation-based algorithms to be presented ompute q\u0303k (sn ) and r\u0303Tk (sn ), through QR de omposition\nfollowed by appli ation of the mapping M, at a subset of OFDM tones of ardinality at least 2kL + 1,\nthen interpolate q\u0303k (s) and r\u0303Tk (s) to obtain q\u0303k (sn ) and r\u0303Tk (sn ) at the remaining tones, and \u001cnally apply the\n\ninverse mapping M\u22121 at these tones. In the following, the sets Ik \u2286 {0, 1, . . . , N \u2212 1}, with Ik\u22121 \u2286 Ik and\n\nBk , |Ik | \u2265 2kL + 1 (k = 1, 2, . . . , MT ), ontain the indi es orresponding to the OFDM tones hosen as\n\nbase points. For ompleteness, we de\u001cne I0 , \u2205. Spe i\u001c\nSe tion 8.\n\nhoi es of the sets Ik will be dis ussed in detail in\n\nWe start with a on eptually simple algorithm for interpolation-based QR de omposition, derived from\nthe observation that the MT statements in (38) an be uni\u001ced into the single statement Q\u0303(s), R\u0303(s) \u223c\n\n(MT L, MT L). This implies that we an interpolate Q\u0303(s) and R\u0303(s) from a single set of base points of\n\nardinality BMT . The orresponding algorithm an be formulated as follows:\nAlgorithm II: Single interpolation step\n1. Interpolate H(s) from S(E) to S(IMT ).\n2. For ea h n \u2208 IMT , perform QR de omposition on H(sn ) to obtain Q(sn ) and R(sn ).\n\n3. For ea h n \u2208 IMT , apply M : (Q(sn ), R(sn )) 7\u2192 (Q\u0303(sn ), R\u0303(sn )).\n4. Interpolate Q\u0303(s) and R\u0303(s) from S(IMT ) to S(D\\IMT ).\n\n5. For ea h n \u2208 D\\IMT , apply M\u22121 : (Q\u0303(sn ), R\u0303(sn )) 7\u2192 (Q(sn ), R(sn )).\nThis formulation of Algorithm II assumes that H(sn ) has full rank for all n \u2208 D\\IMT , whi h allows to\n\nperform all inverse mappings M\u22121 in Step 5 using (13)\u0015(15) only. If, however, for a given n \u2208 D\\IMT , H(sn )\n\nis rank-de\u001c ient with ordered olumn rank K < MT , we have Q\u0303K+1,MT (sn ) = 0 and R\u0303K+1,MT (sn ) = 0.\n\nHen e, a ording to the results in Se tion 4.2, QK+1,MT (sn ) and RK+1,MT (sn ) must be omputed through\nQR de omposition of HK+1,MT (sn ) \u2212 Q1,K (sn )R1,K\nK+1,MT (sn ) for K > 0 or of H(sn ) for K = 0. This, in\n\nturn, requires HK+1,MT (sn ) to be obtained by interpolating HK+1,MT (s) from S(E) to the single target\n19\n\n\fpoint sn in an additional step. For simpli ity of exposition, in the remainder of the paper we will assume\nthat H(sn ) is full-rank for all n \u2208 D.\n\nDeparting from Algorithm II, whi h interpolates q\u0303k (s) and r\u0303Tk (s) from BMT base points, we next present\n\na more sophisti ated algorithm that involves interpolation of q\u0303k (s) and r\u0303Tk (s) from Bk \u2264 BMT base points\n\n(k = 1, 2, . . . , MT ), in agreement with (38). The resulting Algorithm III onsists of MT iterations. In the\n\n\u001crst iteration, the tones n \u2208 I1 are onsidered. At ea h of these tones, QR de omposition is performed\non H(sn ), resulting in Q(sn ) and R(sn ), whi h are then mapped to (Q\u0303(sn ), R\u0303(sn )) by applying M. Next,\n\nq\u03031 (s) and r\u0303T1 (s) are interpolated from the tones n \u2208 I1 to the remaining tones n \u2208 D\\I1 . In the k th iteration\n\n(k = 2, 3, . . . , MT ), the tones n \u2208 Ik \\Ik\u22121 are onsidered. At ea h of these tones, Q1,k\u22121 (sn ) and R1,k\u22121 (sn )\n\nare obtained2 by applying M\u22121 to (Q\u03031,k\u22121 (sn ), R\u03031,k\u22121 (sn )), already known from the previous iterations,\n\nT\nwhereas the submatri es Qk,MT (sn ) and Rk,M\nk,MT (sn ) are obtained by performing QR de omposition on the\n\nk,MT\n(sn ) is given, for\nmatrix Hk,MT (sn ) \u2212 Q1,k\u22121 (sn )R1,k\u22121\nk,MT (sn ), in a ordan e with Proposition 6, and R\n\nk > 1, by [ 0\n\nT\n] . Next, the submatri es Q\u0303k,MT (sn ) and R\u0303k,MT (sn ) are omputed by applying M\nRk,M\nk,MT (sn )\n\nto (Qk,MT (sn ), Rk,MT (sn )). Sin e the samples q\u0303k (sn ) and r\u0303Tk (sn ) are now known at all tones n \u2208 Ik , q\u0303k (s)\nand r\u0303Tk (s) an be interpolated from the tones n \u2208 Ik to the remaining tones n \u2208 D\\Ik , thereby ompleting\n\nthe k th iteration. After MT iterations, we know Q\u0303(sn ) and R\u0303(sn ) at all tones n \u2208 D, as well as Q(sn )\nand R(sn ) at the tones n \u2208 IMT . The last step onsists of applying M\u22121 to (Q\u0303(sn ), R\u0303(sn )) to obtain Q(sn )\nand R(sn ) at the remaining tones n \u2208 D\\Ik . The algorithm is formulated as follows:\nAlgorithm III: Multiple interpolation steps\n1. Set k \u2190 1.\n2. Interpolate Hk,MT (s) from S(E) to S(Ik \\Ik\u22121 ).\n\n3. If k\n\n=\n\n1, go to Step 5.\n\n(Q\u03031,k\u22121 (sn ), R\u0303\n\n1,k\u22121\n\nOtherwise, for ea h n\n\n(sn )) 7\u2192 (Q1,k\u22121 (sn ), R\n\n1,k\u22121\n\n(sn )).\n\n\u2208\n\nIk \\Ik\u22121 , apply M\u22121\n\n:\n\n4.

If k = MT , pro eed to the next step. Otherwise, set k \u2190 k + 1 and go ba k to Step 2.\n9. For ea h n \u2208 D\\IMT , apply M\u22121 : (Q\u0303(sn ), R\u0303(sn )) 7\u2192 (Q(sn ), R(sn )).\n\nIn omparison with Algorithm II, Algorithm III performs QR de ompositions on in reasingly smaller\nmatri es. The orresponding omputational omplexity savings are, however, traded against an in rease in\n2\n\nThe mapping M and its inverse M\u22121 are de\u001cned on submatri es of Q(sn ) and R(sn ) a ording to (10)\u0015(15).\n\n20\n\n\finterpolation e\u001bort and the omputational overhead asso iated with Step 4, whi h will be referred to as\nthe redu tion step in what follows. Moreover, the omplexity of applying M and M\u22121 di\u001bers for the two\n\nalgorithms. A detailed omplexity analysis provided in the next se tion will show that, depending on the\nsystem parameters, Algorithm III an exhibit smaller omplexity than Algorithm II.\n\nWe on lude this se tion with some remarks on ordered SC MIMO-OFDM dete tors [13\u2104, whi h essentially permute the olumns of H(sn ) to perform SC dete tion of the transmitted data symbols a ording\nto a given sorting riterion (su h as, e.g., V-BLAST sorting [21\u2104) to obtain better dete tion performan e\nthan in the unsorted ase. The permutation of the olumns of H(sn ) an be represented by means of\nright-multipli ation of H(sn ) by an MT \u00d7 MT permutation matrix P(sn ). The matri es subje ted to\n\nQR de omposition are then given by H(sn )P(sn ), n \u2208 D. If P(sn ) is onstant a ross all OFDM tones,\ni.e., P(sn ) = P0 , n \u2208 D, we have H(s)P0 \u223c (0, L) and Algorithms I\u0015III an be applied to H(sn )P0 . A\n\nMIMO-OFDM ordered SC dete tor using Algorithm II to ompute QR fa tors of H(s)P0 , along with a\nstrategy for hoosing P0 , was presented in [22\u2104. If P(sn ) varies a ross n, the matri es H(sn )P(sn ), n \u2208 D,\nin general, an no longer be seen as samples of a polynomial matrix of maximum degree L \u226a D, so that the\n\ninterpolation-based QR de omposition algorithms presented above an not be applied.\n\n6. Complexity Analysis\nWe are next interested in assessing under whi h ir umstan es the interpolation-based Algorithms II\nand III o\u001ber omputational omplexity savings over the brute-for e approa h in Algorithm I. To this end, we\npropose a simple omputational omplexity metri , representative of VLSI ir uit omplexity as quanti\u001ced\nby the produ t of hip area and pro essing delay [10\u2104. We note that other important aspe ts of VLSI\ndesign, in luding, e.g., wordwidth requirements, memory a ess strategies, and datapath ar hite ture, are\nnot a ounted for in our analysis. Nevertheless, the proposed metri is indi ative of the omplexity of\nAlgorithms I\u0015III and allows to quantify the impa t of the system parameters on the potential savings of\ninterpolation-based QR de omposition over brute-for e per-tone QR de omposition.\nIn the remainder of the paper, unless expli itly spe i\u001ced otherwise, the term omplexity refers to omputational omplexity a ording to the metri de\u001cned in Se tion 6.1 below. We derive the omplexity of\nindividual omputational tasks (i.e., interpolation, QR de omposition, mapping M, inverse mapping M\u22121 ,\n\nand redu tion step) in Se tion 6.2. Then, we pro eed to omputing the total omplexity of Algorithms I\u0015III\nin Se tion 6.3. Finally, in Se tion 6.4 we ompare the omplexity results obtained in Se tion 6.3 and we\nderive onditions on the system parameters under whi h Algorithms II and III exhibit lower omplexity\nthan Algorithm I.\n\n21\n\n\f6.1. Complexity Metri\nIn the VLSI implementation of a given algorithm, a wide range of trade-o\u001bs between sili on area A\nand pro essing delay \u03c4 an, in general, be realized [10\u2104. Parallel pro essing redu es \u03c4 at the expense of\na larger A, whereas resour e sharing redu es A at the expense of a larger \u03c4 . However, the orresponding\nir uit transformations typi ally do not a\u001be t the area-delay produ t A\u03c4 signi\u001c antly. For this reason, the\narea-delay produ t is onsidered a relevant indi ator of algorithm omplexity [10\u2104. In the de\u001cnition of the\nspe i\u001c\n\nomplexity metri that will be used subsequently, we only take into a ount the arithmeti operations\n\nwith a signi\u001c ant impa t on A\u03c4 . More spe i\u001c ally, we divide the operations underlying the algorithms under\nonsideration into three lasses, namely i) multipli ations, ii) divisions and square roots, and iii) additions\nand subtra tions. Class iii) operations will not be ounted as they typi ally have a signi\u001c antly lower VLSI\nir uit omplexity than Class i) and Class ii) operations.\nIn all algorithms presented in this paper, the number of Class i) operations is signi\u001c antly larger than\nthe number of Class ii) operations.3 By assuming a VLSI ar hite ture where the Class ii) operations are\nperformed by low-area high-delay arithmeti al units operating in parallel to the multipliers performing the\nClass i) operations, it follows that the Class i) operations dominate the overall omplexity and the Class ii)\noperations an be negle ted.\nWithin Class i), we distinguish between full multipli ations (i.e., multipli ations of two variable operands)\nand onstant multipli ations (i.e., multipli ations of a variable operand by a onstant operand4 ). We de\u001cne\nthe ost of a full multipli ation as the unit of omputational omplexity. We do not distinguish between realvalued full multipli ations and omplex-valued full multipli ations, as we assume that both are performed\nby multipliers designed to pro ess two variable omplex-valued operands. The fa t, dis ussed in detail in\nSe tion 8.1, that a onstant multipli ation an be implemented in VLSI at signi\u001c antly smaller ost than a\nfull multipli ation, will be a ounted for through a weighting fa tor smaller than one.\n6.2. Per-Tone Complexity of Individual Computational Tasks\nIn order to simplify the notation, in the remainder of this se tion we drop the dependen e of all quantities\non sn . We furthermore introdu e the auxiliary variable\nJk , M R k + M T k \u2212\n3\n\n(k \u2212 1)k\n,\n2\n\nk = 1, 2, . . . , MT\n\nWe assume that division of an M -dimensional ve tor a by a s alar \u03b1, su h as the divisions in (2), (13), or (14), is\n\nimplemented by \u001crst omputing the single division \u03b2 , 1/\u03b1 and then multiplying the M entries of a by \u03b2 , at the ost of one\nClass ii) operation and M Class i) operations, respe tively.\n4\nIn the ontext of the interpolation-based algorithms onsidered in this paper, all operands that depend on H(s) are\nassumed variable. The oe\u001e ients of interpolation \u001clters, e.g., are treated as onstant operands. For a detailed dis ussion on\nthe di\u001beren e between full multipli ations and onstant multipli ations, we refer to Se tion 8.1.\n\n22\n\n\fwhi h spe i\u001ces the maximum total number of nonzero entries in Q1,k and R1,k , and hen e also in Q\u03031,k\nand R\u03031,k , in a ordan e with the fa t that R and R\u0303 are upper triangular.\nInterpolation. We quantify the omplexity of interpolating an LP to one target point through an equivalent\nof cIP full multipli ations. The dependen e of interpolation omplexity on the underlying VLSI implementation and on the number of base points is assumed to be in orporated into cIP . Spe i\u001c strategies for e\u001e ient\ninterpolation along with the orresponding values of cIP are presented in Se tion 8. Sin e interpolation of\nan LP matrix is performed entrywise, the omplexity of interpolating Hk,MT (s) to one target point is given\nby\n\u0001\nT\n= MR MT \u2212 k + 1 cIP ,\nck,M\nIP,H\n\nk = 1, 2, . . . , MT .\n\nSimilarly, interpolation of Q\u0303(s) and R\u0303(s) to one target point has omplexity\ncIP,Q\u0303R\u0303 = JMT cIP\n\nand the omplexity of interpolating q\u0303k (s) and r\u0303Tk (s) to one target point is given by\n\u0001\n(k)\ncIP,q\u0303r\u0303 = MR + MT \u2212 k + 1 cIP ,\n\nk = 1, 2, . . . , MT .\n\nQR de omposition. In order to keep our dis ussion independent of the QR de omposition method, we denote\nR \u00d7k\n(k = 1, 2, . . . , MT ). Spe i\u001c\nthe ost of performing QR de omposition on an MR \u00d7 k matrix by cM\nQR\n\nMR \u00d7k\nexpressions for cQR\nwill only be required in the numeri al omplexity analysis in Se tion 9.\n\nMapping M. We denote the overall ost of mapping (Qk,MT , Rk,MT ) to (Q\u0303k,MT , R\u0303k,MT ) (k = 1, 2, . . . , MT )\nT\n. In the ase k = 1, appli ation of the mapping M requires omputation of [R]1,1 , [R]21,1 ,\nby ck,M\nM\nQ T\n2\n[R]21,1 [R]2,2 , [R]21,1 [R]22,2 , . . . , M\ni=1 [R]i,i , at the ost of 2MT \u2212 1 full multipli ations. This step yields both\n\nthe s aling fa tors \u2206k\u2032 \u22121 [R]k\u2032 ,k\u2032 , k \u2032 = 1, 2, . . . , MT , and the diagonal entries of R\u0303. From (31) we an dedu e\n\nthat the \u001crst olumn of Q\u0303 is equal to the \u001crst olumn of H and is hen e obtained at zero omplexity. The\nremaining entries of Q\u0303 and the entries of R\u0303 above the main diagonal are obtained by s aling the orresponding entries of Q and R a ording to (11) and (12), respe tively, whi h requires JMT \u2212 MR \u2212 MT full\n\nmultipli ations.

Total Complexity of Algorithms I\u0015III\nThe ontribution of a given omputational task to the overall omplexity of a given algorithm is obtained\nby multiplying the orresponding per-tone omplexity, omputed in the previous se tion, by the number of\n24\n\n\frelevant tones.

Complexity Comparisons\nIn the following, we identify onditions on the system parameters and on the interpolation ost cIP that\nguarantee that Algorithms II and III exhibit smaller omplexity than Algorithm I.

Moreover, for cIP < cIP,max,II,\n\nin reasing BMT redu es CI \u2212 CII . If the inequality (43) is met, (42) implies, sin e BMT = 2MT L + 1, that for\nMR \u00d7MT\n,\nin reasing L and with all other parameters \u001cxed, Algorithm II exhibits smaller savings. For larger cQR\n\nagain with all other parameters \u001cxed, Algorithm II exhibits larger savings.\nIn order to ompare Algorithms II and III, we start from (40) and (41) and rewrite CII \u2212 CIII as\nCII \u2212 CIII = \u2206cQR + \u2206cM,M\u22121 + \u2206cIP,HQ\u0303R\u0303 \u2212 cred,III\n\n(44)\n\nwhere we have introdu ed\n\u2206cQR , cQR,II \u2212 cQR,III\n\u2206cM,M\u22121 , cM,II + cM\u22121 ,II \u2212 cM,III \u2212 cM\u22121 ,III\n\u2206cIP,HQ\u0303R\u0303 , cIP,H,II + cIP,Q\u0303R\u0303,II \u2212 cIP,H,III \u2212 cIP,Q\u0303R\u0303,III .\n\nFrom the results in Table 1 we get\n\u2206cQR = 2L\n\nMT \u0010\nX\nk=2\n\nM \u00d7(MT \u2212k+1)\n\nR \u00d7MT\n\u2212 cQRR\ncM\nQR\n\n25\n\n\u0011\n\n(45)\n\n\fM \u00d7(MT \u2212k+1)\n\nMR \u00d7MT\nwhi h is positive sin e, obviously, cQR\n> cQRR\n\n(k = 2, 3, . . . , MT ).

The MMSE Case\nIn this se tion, we modify the QR de omposition algorithms des ribed in Se tion 5 to obtain orresponding algorithms that ompute the MMSE-QR de omposition, as de\u001cned in Se tion 3.2, of the hannel\nmatri es H(sn ), n \u2208 D. In Se tion 7.1, we dis uss the general on ept of regularized QR de omposition,\n\nof whi h MMSE-QR de omposition is a spe ial ase. In Se tion 7.2, we use the results of Se tion 7.1 to\nformulate and analyze MMSE-QR de omposition algorithms for MIMO-OFDM.\n7.1. Regularized QR De omposition\nIn the following, we onsider, as done in Se tion 2.2, a generi matrix A \u2208 CP \u00d7M, with P \u2265 M .\n\nDe\u001cnition 10.\n\nThe regularized QR de omposition of A with the real-valued regularization parameter \u03b1 > 0,\n\nis the unique fa torization A = QR, where the regularized QR fa tors Q \u2208 CP \u00d7M and R \u2208 CM\u00d7M are\n\nobtained as follows: \u0100 = Q\u0304R is the unique QR de omposition of the full-rank (P + M ) \u00d7 M augmented\nmatrix \u0100 , [ AT\n\n\u03b1IM ]T, and Q , Q\u03041,P.\n\nIn the following, we onsider GS-based and UT-based algorithms for omputing the regularized QR deomposition of A through the QR de omposition of the augmented matrix \u0100. We will see that both lasses\n26\n\n\fof algorithms exhibit higher omplexity than the orresponding algorithms for QR de omposition of A\ndes ribed in Se tion 2.2.\nGS-based QR de omposition of \u0100 produ es Q, R, and, as a by-produ t, the M \u00d7 M matrix Q\u0304P +1,P +M.\n\nSin e GS-based QR de omposition a ording to (1)\u0015(3) operates on entire olumns of the matrix to be\nde omposed, the omputation of Q\u0304P +1,P +M an not be avoided. Thus, GS-based regularized QR de omposition of A has the same omplexity as GS-based QR de omposition of \u0100, whi h in turn has a higher\nomplexity than GS-based QR de omposition of A.\nRepresenting the UT-based QR de omposition of \u0100 in\n\uf8ee\nA\nIP\n0\n\u0398U * * * \u03982 \u03981 \uf8f0\n\u03b1IM 0 IM\n{z\n|\n\u0003\n\u0002\n= \u0100 IP +M\n\nthe standard form (4) yields\n\uf8f9 \uf8ee\n\uf8f9\nR\nQ\u0304H\n\uf8fb=\uf8f0\n\uf8fb\n0 (Q\u0304\u22a5 )H\n}\n\n(49)\n\nwith the (P + M ) \u00d7 (P + M ) unitary matri es \u0398u , u = 1, 2, . . . , U , and where Q\u0304\u22a5 is a (P + M ) \u00d7 P matrix\n\nsatisfying (Q\u0304\u22a5 )H Q\u0304\u22a5 = IP and Q\u0304H Q\u0304\u22a5 = 0.

As observed previously in [3\u2104, the\norresponding omplexity overhead an not be eliminated ompletely, but it an be redu ed by removing\nthe last M olumns on both sides of (49). Thus, using (50), we obtain the e\u001e ient UT-based regularized\nQR de omposition des ribed by the standard form\n\uf8f9\n\uf8f9 \uf8ee\n\uf8ee\nR\nQH\nA\nIP\n\uf8fb\n\uf8fb=\uf8f0\n\u0398U * * * \u03982 \u03981 \uf8f0\n0 ((Q\u0304\u22a5 )1,P )H\n\u03b1IM 0\n\n(51)\n\nwhi h yields only ((Q\u0304\u22a5 )1,P )H as a by-produ t [3\u2104. We note that sin e the P \u00d7 P matrix ((Q\u0304\u22a5 )1,P )H is\n\nlarger than the (P \u2212 M ) \u00d7 P matrix (Q\u22a5 )H in (4), obtained as a by-produ t of UT-based QR de omposition\nof A, e\u001e ient UT-based regularized QR de omposition of A exhibits higher omplexity than UT-based\n\nQR de omposition of A.\nFinally, we note that sin e Q = Q\u03041,P, applying the mapping M to the regularized QR fa tors Q and R\n \u0303\nof A a ording to (10)\u0015(12) is equivalent to applying M to the QR fa tors Q\u0304 and R of \u0100 to obtain Q\u0304\n \u0303 1,P. With this insight, it is straightforward to verify that Theorem 9,\nand R\u0303 followed by extra ting Q\u0303 = Q\u0304\nformulated for QR de omposition of an LP matrix A(s), is valid for regularized QR de omposition of A(s)\nas well.\n27\n\n\f7.2. Appli ation to MIMO-OFDM MMSE-Based Dete tors\nWith the de\u001cnition of regularized QR de omposition in the previous se tion, we re ognize that MMSEQR de omposition of H(sn ), de\u001cned in Se tion 3.2, is a spe ial ase of regularized QR de omposition\n\u221a\nof H(sn ) obtained by setting the regularization parameter \u03b1 to MT \u03c3w . The modi\u001c ation of Algorithms I\nand II to the MMSE ase is straightforward and simply amounts to repla ing, in Step 2 of both algorithms,\nQR de omposition by MMSE-QR de omposition. The resulting algorithms are referred to as Algorithm IMMSE and Algorithm II-MMSE, respe tively.\nIn the following, we ompare the omplexity of Algorithm I-MMSE and Algorithm II-MMSE. By denoting the omplexity asso iated with omputing the MMSE-QR de omposition of an MR \u00d7 MT matrix\n\nMR \u00d7MT\nby cMMSE-QR\n, the overall omplexity of Algorithms I-MMSE and II-MMSE is given by\n\n\u0011\n\u0010\nMR \u00d7MT\nR \u00d7MT\nCI-MMSE = CI + D cM\n\u2212 cQR\nMMSE-QR\n\n(52)\n\nand\nMR \u00d7MT\nMR \u00d7MT\nCII-MMSE = CII + BMT cMMSE-QR\n\u2212 cQR\n\n\u0001\n\n(53)\n\nMR \u00d7MT\nR \u00d7MT\nrespe tively. Sin e cMMSE-QR\n> cM\n, as explained in Se tion 7.1, (52) and (53) imply that CI-MMSE > CI\nQR\n\nand CII-MMSE > CII , respe tively. Thus, from (39), (40), (52), and (53), we get\n\u0011\n\u0010\n1,MT\nMR \u00d7MT\n\u22121 ,II ) + BM\nc\n+\nc\n+\nc\n+\nc\n(c\nM,\nII\nM\nT\nIP,\nQ\u0303\nR\u0303,\nII\nIP,\nH\nMMSE-QR\nCII-MMSE\n\u0010\n\u0011\n=\nCII\n(cM,II + c\n+ c \u22121 ) + BM c1,MT + cMR \u00d7MT\nIP,Q\u0303R\u0303,II\n\n<\n\n1,MT\nMR \u00d7MT\ncIP,\nH + cMMSE-QR\nT\nR \u00d7MT\nc1,M\n+ cM\nIP,H\nQR\n\n=\n\nCI-MMSE\nCI\n\nM\n\n,II\n\nT\n\nIP,H\n\nQR\n\n(54)\n\nwhere the inequality follows from the simple property\n\u03b1 > \u03b2 > 0, \u03b3 > 0 =\u21d2\n\n\u03b3+\u03b1\n\u03b1\n< .\n\u03b3+\u03b2\n\u03b2\n\nFrom (54) we an therefore on lude that\nCII-MMSE\nCII\n<\nCI-MMSE\nCI\n\nwhi h implies, assuming CII < CI , that the relative savings of Algorithm II-MMSE over Algorithm I-MMSE\nare larger than the relative savings of Algorithm II over Algorithm I.\nFinally, we brie\u001dy dis uss the extension of Algorithm III to the MMSE ase. As a starting point, we onsider the straightforward approa h of applying Algorithm III to the MMSE-augmented hannel matrix H\u0304(sn )\n \u0303 (s ) and R\u0303(s ) the matriin (9) to produ e Q\u0304(s ) and R(s ) for all n \u2208 D. In the following, we denote by Q\u0304\nn\n\nn\n\nn\n\nn\n\nes resulting from the appli ation of the mapping M to (Q\u0304(sn ), R(sn )). We observe that the straightforward\n28\n\n\fapproa h under onsideration is ine\u001e ient, sin e we are only interested in obtaining Q(sn ) = Q\u03041,MR (sn )\nand R(sn ) for all n \u2208 D. Consequently, we would like to avoid omputing the last MT rows of Q\u0304(sn ) at as\n\nmany tones as possible. Now, the redu tion step (i.e., Step 4) in the k th iteration of Algorithm III requires\nknowledge of Q\u03041,k\u22121 (sn ) at the tones n \u2208 Ik \\Ik\u22121 (k = 2, 3, . . . , MT ). Hen e, at the tones n \u2208 Ik \\Ik\u22121 we\nmust ompute all MR + MT rows of Q\u03041,k\u22121 (sn ) anyway. In ontrast, at the tones n \u2208 D\\IMT the last MT\n\nrows of Q\u0304(sn ) are not required. Therefore, at the tones n \u2208 D\\IMT we an restri t interpolation and inverse\n \u0303 1,MR (s ) and R\u0303(s ).\nmapping to Q\u0303(s ) = Q\u0304\nn\n\nn\n\nn\n\n \u0303 (s ), as\n \u0303 k (sn ), the k th olumn of Q\u0304\nIn the following, we partition q\u0304\nn\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n\u0001\nq\u0303 (s )\n \u0303 k sn = \uf8f0 k n \uf8fb,\nq\u0304\nk = 1, 2, . . . , MT\nq\u030ck (sn )\n\nwith the MR \u00d7 1 ve tor q\u0303k (sn ) and the MT \u00d7 1 ve tor q\u030ck (sn ). With this notation, we an formulate the\n\nresulting algorithm as follows:\nAlgorithm III-MMSE\n1. Set k \u2190 1.\n\n2. Interpolate Hk,MT (s) from S(E) to S(Ik \\Ik\u22121 ).\n\n3.

For ea h n \u2208 D\\IMT , apply M\u22121 : (Q\u0303(sn ), R\u0303(sn )) 7\u2192 (Q(sn ), R(sn )).\n\na Sin e q\u030c\nMT (sn ) is not needed, its omputation in the MT th iteration an be skipped.\n\nA detailed omplexity analysis of Algorithm III-MMSE goes beyond the s ope of this paper. We mention, however, the following important aspe t of the omparison of Algorithm III-MMSE with Algorithms\nI-MMSE and II-MMSE. Step 2 of Algorithms I-MMSE and II-MMSE requires MMSE-QR de omposition,\nwhi h is a spe ial ase of regularized QR de omposition, whereas Step 6 of Algorithm III-MMSE requires\nQR de omposition of an augmented matrix. As shown in Se tion 7.1, the algorithms for regularized QR deomposition and for QR de omposition of an augmented matrix have the same omplexity under a GS-based\n29\n\n\fapproa h, but not under a UT-based approa h. In the latter ase, Algorithms I-MMSE and II-MMSE an\nperform e\u001e ient UT-based regularized QR de omposition a ording to the standard form (51), whereas\nAlgorithm III-MMSE must perform UT-based QR de omposition of an augmented matrix a ording to the\nstandard form (49), whi h results in higher omplexity. This aspe t does not o ur in the omparison of\nAlgorithm III with Algorithms I and II and will be further examined numeri ally in Se tion 9.2.\n\n8. E\u001e ient Interpolation\nThroughout this se tion, we onsider interpolation of a generi LP a(s) \u223c (V1 , V2 ) of maximum degree\n\nV = V1 + V2 from B to T , where |B| = B and |T | = T . We note that in the ontext of interpolation in\n\nMIMO-OFDM systems, relevant for the algorithms presented in this paper, all base points and all target\npoints orrespond to OFDM tones. Therefore, in the following we assume that B and T satisfy the ondition\nB \u222a T \u2286 {s0 , s1 , . . . , sN \u22121 }.\n\n(55)\n\nThe omplexity analysis in Se tion 6 showed that interpolation-based QR de omposition algorithms yield\nsavings over the brute-for e approa h only if cIP is su\u001e iently small. Straightforward interpolation of a(s),\nwhi h orresponds to dire t evaluation of (8), is performed by arrying out the multipli ation of the T \u00d7 B\n\ninterpolation matrix TB\u2020 by the B\u00d71 ve tor aB . The orresponding omplexity is given by T B , whi h results\nin cIP = B full multipli ations per target point. In the ontext of interpolation-based QR de omposition,\nthis omplexity may be too high to get savings over the brute-for e approa h in Algorithms I or I-MMSE,\nsin e exa t interpolation of q\u0303k (s) \u223c (kL, kL) and r\u0303Tk (s) \u223c (kL, kL) requires B \u2265 2kL + 1 (k = 1, 2, . . . , MT ),\n\nwith the worst ase being B \u2265 2MT L + 1. In this se tion, we present interpolation methods hara terized\nby signi\u001c antly smaller values of cIP . As demonstrated by the numeri al results in Se tion 9, this an then\n\nlead to signi\u001c ant savings of the interpolation-based approa hes for QR de omposition over the brute-for e\napproa h.\n8.1. Interpolation with Dedi ated Multipliers\nAs already noted, the interpolation matrix TB\u2020 is a fun tion of B , T , V1 and V2 , but not of the realization\n\nof the LP a(s) to be interpolated. Hen e, as long as B , T , V1 and V2 do not hange, multiple LPs an be\n\ninterpolated using the same interpolation matrix TB\u2020, whi h an be omputed o\u001b-line. This observation\nleads to the \u001crst strategy for e\u001e ient interpolation, whi h onsists of arrying out the matrix-ve tor produ t\n(TB\u2020 )aB in (8) through T B onstant multipli ations, where the entries of TB\u2020 are onstant and the entries\n\nof aB are variable.\nIn the ontext of VLSI implementation, full multipli ations and onstant multipli ations di\u001ber signi\u001cantly. Whereas a full multipli ation must be performed by a full multiplier whi h pro esses two variable\n30\n\n\foperands, in a onstant multipli ation, the fa t that one of the operands, and more spe i\u001c ally its binary\nrepresentation, is known a priori, an be exploited to perform binary logi simpli\u001c ations that result in\na drasti ally simpler ir uit [10\u2104. The resulting multiplier, alled a dedi ated multiplier in the following,\nonsumes only a fra tion of the sili on area (down to 1/9, as reported in [7\u2104 for omplex-valued dedi ated\nmultipliers) required by a full multiplier, and exhibits the same pro essing delay. Furthermore, we mention\nthat it is possible to obtain further area savings, again without a\u001be ting the pro essing delay, by merging K\ndedi ated multipliers into a single blo k multiplier that jointly performs the K multipli ations, a ording\nto a te hnique known as partial produ t sharing [11\u2104, whi h essentially exploits ommon bit patterns in the\nbinary representations of the K oe\u001e ients to obtain ir uit simpli\u001c ations. For simpli ity of exposition, in\nthe sequel we do not onsider partial produ t sharing.\nIn the remainder of the paper, \u03c7C and \u03c7R denote the omplexity asso iated with a onstant multipliation of a omplex-valued variable operand by a omplex-valued and by a real-valued onstant oe\u001e ient,\nrespe tively. Sin e TB\u2020 is real-valued for V1 = V2 and omplex-valued otherwise, interpolation through\nonstant multipli ations with dedi ated multipliers has a omplexity per target point of\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2\u03c7R B,\nV1 = V2\ncIP =\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\u03c7C B,\nV1 =\n6 V2 .\n\nBy leaving a autionary implementation margin from the best-e\u001bort value of 1/9 reported in [7\u2104, we assume\nthat \u03c7C = 1/4 in the remainder of the paper. Sin e the multipli ation of two omplex-valued numbers\nrequires (assuming straightforward implementation) four real-valued multipli ations, whereas multiplying a\nreal-valued number by a omplex-valued number requires only two real-valued multipli ations, we hen eforth\nassume that \u03c7R = \u03c7C /2, whi h leads to \u03c7R = 1/8.\n8.2. Equidistant Base Points\nIn the following, we say that the points in a set {u0 , u1 , . . . , uK\u22121 } \u2282 U are equidistant on U if uk =\n\nu0 ej2\u03c0k/K for k = 1, 2, . . . , K \u2212 1. So far, we dis ussed interpolation of a(s) \u223c (V1 , V2 ) for generi sets B\n\nand T . In the remainder of Se tion 8 we will, however, fo us on the following spe ial ase. Given integers\nB, R > 1, we onsider the set of B base points B = {bk = ej2\u03c0k/B : k = 0, 1, . . . , B \u2212 1} and the set of\n\nT = (R \u2212 1)B target points T = {t(R\u22121)k+r\u22121 = bk ej2\u03c0r/(RB) : k = 0, 1, . . . , B \u2212 1, r = 1, 2, . . . , R \u2212 1}.\n\nWe note that both the B points in B and the RB points in B \u222a T = {ej2\u03c0l/(RB) : l = 0, 1, . . . , RB \u2212 1} are\n\nequidistant on U . Hen e, interpolation of a(s) from B to T essentially amounts to an R-fold in rease in the\nsampling rate of a(s) on U , and will therefore be termed upsampling of a(s) from B equidistant base points\n\nby a fa tor of R in the remainder of the paper. The orresponding base point matrix B and target point\n\nmatrix T are onstru ted a ording to (6) and (7), respe tively. We note that for B \u2265 V + 1, B satis\u001ces\nBH B = BIB and hen e B\u2020 = (1/B)BH.\n\n31\n\n\fWe re all that the number of OFDM tones N is typi ally a power of two. Therefore, in order to have RB\nequidistant points on U while satisfying the ondition (55), in the following we onstrain both B and R to\n\nbe powers of two. Finally, in order to satisfy the ondition B \u2265 V + 1 mandated by the requirement of exa t\n\ninterpolation, we set B = 2\u2308log(V +1)\u2309 .\n\n8.3. Interpolation by Fast Fourier Transform\nIn the ontext of upsampling from B equidistant base points by a fa tor of R, it is straightforward to\nverify that the B \u00d7 (V + 1) matrix B is given by\n\u0002\nB = (WB )B\u2212V1 +1,B\n\n(WB )1,V2 +1\n\n\u0003\n\n(56)\n\nand that the (R \u2212 1)B \u00d7 (V + 1) matrix T is obtained by removing the rows with indi es in R , {1, R +\n\n1, . . . , (B \u2212 1)R + 1} from the RB \u00d7 (V + 1) matrix\n\n\u0002\nT\u0304 , (WRB )RB\u2212V1 +1,RB\n\n\u0003\n(WRB )1,V2 +1 .\n\n(57)\n\nAs done in Se tion 2.3, we onsider the ve tors a = [a\u2212V1 a\u2212V1 +1 * * * aV2 ]T, aB = Ba, and aT = Ta. By\n\nde\u001cning the B -dimensional ve tor a(B) , [a0 a1 * * * aV2 0 * * * 0 a\u2212V1 a\u2212V1 +1 * * * a\u22121 ]T, whi h ontains\nB \u2212 (V + 1) zeros between the entries aV2 and a\u2212V1 , and by taking (56) into a ount, we an write aB =\n\nBa = WB a(B), from whi h follows that a(B) = WB\u22121 aB . Next, we insert (R \u2212 1)B zeros into a(B) after\n\nthe entry aV2 to obtain the RB -dimensional ve tor a(RB) , [a0 a1 * * * aV2 0 * * * 0 a\u2212V1 a\u2212V1 +1 * * * a\u22121 ]T.\n\nFurther, we de\u001cne aB\u222aT , [a(ej0 ) a(ej2\u03c0/RB ) * * * a(ej2\u03c0(RB\u22121)/RB )]T = T\u0304a to be the ve tor ontaining the\nsamples of a(s) at the points in B \u222a T . We note that using (57) we an write\nT\u0304a = WRB a(RB) .\n\n(58)\n\nNext, we observe that by removing the rows with indi es in R from both sides of the equality aB\u222aT = T\u0304a we\nobtain the equality aT = Ta. The latter observation, ombined with (58), implies that aT\n\nan be obtained\n\nby removing the rows with indi es in R from the ve tor WRB a(RB). Finally, we note that sin e B and RB\n\nare powers of two, left-multipli ation by WB\u22121 and WRB an be omputed through a B -point radix-2 inverse\n\nFFT (IFFT) and an RB -point radix-2 FFT, respe tively [2\u2104. We an therefore on lude that FFT-based\ninterpolation of a(s) from B to T\n\nan be arried out as follows:\n\n1. Compute the B -point radix-2 IFFT a(B) = WB\u22121 aB .\n2. Constru t a(RB) from a(B) by inserting (R \u2212 1)B zeros after the entry aV2 in a(B) .\n3. Compute the RB -point radix-2 FFT aB\u222aT = WRB a(RB).\n\n4. Extra t aT from aB\u222aT by removing the entries of aB\u222aT with indi es in R.\n32\n\n\fNow, we note that if generi radix-2 IFFT and FFT algorithms are used in Steps 1 and 3, respe tively,\nthe approa h des ribed above does not exploit the stru ture of the problem at hand and is ine\u001e ient in\nthe following three aspe ts. First, neither the IFFT in Step 1 nor the FFT in Step 3 take into a ount\nthat B \u2212 (V + 1) entries of a(B) (and also, by onstru tion, of a(RB) ) are zero. As this ine\u001e ien y does\n\nnot arise in the ase B = V + 1 and has only marginal impa t on interpolation omplexity otherwise, we\n\nwill not onsider it further. Se ond, the FFT in Step 3 ignores the fa t that a(RB) ontains the (R \u2212 1)B\n\nzeros that were inserted in Step 2. Third, the values of a(s) at the base points, whi h are already known\n\nprior to interpolation, are unne essarily omputed by the FFT in Step 3 and then dis arded in Step 4.\nIn the following, we present a modi\u001ced FFT algorithm, tailored to the problem at hand, whi h eliminates\nthe latter two ine\u001e ien ies and leads to a signi\u001c antly lower interpolation omplexity than the generi\nFFT-based interpolation method des ribed above.\nFrom now on, in order to simplify the notation, we assume that N = RB . Thus, with sn = ej2\u03c0n/N,\nn = 0, 1, . . . , N \u2212 1, the base points and the target points are given by bk = sRk and t(R\u22121)k+r\u22121 = sRk+r\n\n(k = 0, 1, . . . , B \u2212 1, r = 1, 2, . . . , R \u2212 1), respe tively. The derivation presented in the following will be\n\nillustrated through an example obtained by setting B = R = 4 and V1 = V2 + 1 = 2, but is valid in general\n\nfor the ase where V1 and V2 satisfy the inequalities 0 \u2264 V1 \u2264 B/2 and 0 \u2264 V2 \u2264 B/2 \u2212 1, respe tively.\nWe note that these two inequalities, ombined with B = 2\u2308log(V1 +V2 +1)\u2309 , are satis\u001ced in the ase V1 = V2 .\n\nHen e, the following derivation overs the ase of interpolation of the entries of Q\u0303(s) \u223c (MT L, MT L)\nand R\u0303(s) \u223c (MT L, MT L), as required in Algorithms II, III, II-MMSE and III-MMSE.\n\nThe proposed modi\u001ced FFT is based on a de imation-in-time radix-2 N -point FFT, onsisting of a\n\ns rambling stage followed by log N omputation stages [2\u2104, ea h ontaining N/2 radix-2 butter\u001dies des ribed\nby the signal \u001dow graph (SFG) in Fig. 1a. The twiddle fa tors used in the FFT butter\u001dies are powers of\n\u03c9N , e\u2212j2\u03c0/N.\n\nThe SFG of the unmodi\u001ced N -point FFT is shown in Fig. 1b. We observe that the s rambling stage at\nthe beginning of the FFT (not depi ted in Fig. 1b) auses the nonzero entries a\u2212V1 , a\u2212V1 +1 , . . . , aV2 of a(RB)\nto be s attered rather than to appear in blo ks as is the ase in a(RB). The main idea of the proposed\napproa h is to prune all SFG bran hes that involve multipli ations and additions with operands equal to\nzero, as done in [15\u2104,5 and all SFG bran hes that lead to the omputation of the already known values of a(s)\nat the base points. The SFG of the resulting pruned FFT is shown in Fig. 2a.\nFurther omplexity redu tions an be obtained as follows.

The\nresulting savings will, for the sake of generality of exposition, not be taken into a ount in the following.\n8.4. Interpolation by FIR Filtering\nWe onsider upsampling of a(s) from B equidistant base points by a fa tor of R, as de\u001cned in Se tion 8.2.\nThe derivations in this se tion are valid for arbitrary integers B, R > 1, and hen e not spe i\u001c to the ase\nwhere B and R are powers of two.\n\nProposition 11.\n\nIn the ontext of upsampling from B equidistant base points by a fa tor of R, the B(R \u2212\n\n1) \u00d7 B interpolation matrix TB\u2020 satis\u001ces the following properties:\n\n1.

Sin e B\u2020 = (1/B)BH, the entries of TB\u2020 are given by\n\u0002\n\nTB\u2020\n\n\u0003\n\nk(R\u22121)+r,k\u2032 +1\n\nV2\nR(k\u2212k\u2032 )+r\n1 X\ne\u2212j2\u03c0v RB\nB\n\n=\n\n(61)\n\nv=\u2212V1\n\nfor k, k \u2032 = 0, 1, . . . , B \u2212 1 and r = 1, 2, . . . , R \u2212 1. The two properties are now established as follows:\n1. The RHS of (61) remains un hanged upon repla ing k and k \u2032 by (k + 1) mod B and (k \u2032 + 1) mod B ,\nrespe tively. Hen e, for a given r \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , R \u2212 1}, the B \u00d7 B matrix obtained by sta king the rows\nindexed by r, (R \u2212 1) + r, . . . , (B \u2212 1)(R \u2212 1) + r (in this order) of TB\u2020 is ir ulant. By taking F0\n\nto onsist of the last R \u2212 1 rows of TB\u2020, and using CB\nB = IB , along with the fa t that for b \u2208 Z,\n\nthe multipli ation F0 CbB orresponds to ir ularly shifting the olumns of F0 to the right by b mod B\npositions, we obtain (60).\n2. The entries of F0 are obtained by setting k = B \u2212 1 in (61) and are given by\n[F0 ]r,k\u2032 +1 =\n\nV2\nr\u2212R(k\u2032 +1)\n1 X\ne\u2212j2\u03c0v RB ,\nB\n\nr = 1, 2, . . . , R \u2212 1, k \u2032 = 0, 1, . . . , B \u2212 1.\n\nv=\u2212V1\n\nHen e, for r = 1, 2, . . . , R \u2212 1 and k \u2032 = 0, 1, . . . , B \u2212 1, we obtain\n[F0 ]\u2217R\u2212r,B\u2212k\u2032 =\n\nV2\nR\u2212r\u2212R(B\u2212k\u2032 )\n1 X\nRB\nej2\u03c0v\nB\nv=\u2212V1\n\n=\n\nV2\nr\u2212R(k\u2032 +1)\n1 X\ne\u2212j2\u03c0v RB\nB\nv=\u2212V1\n\n= [F0 ]r,k\u2032 +1 .\n\nWe note that Property 1 in Proposition 11 implies that the matrix-ve tor multipli ation (TB\u2020 )aB in (8)\nan be arried out through the appli ation of R \u2212 1 FIR \u001clters. Spe i\u001c ally, for r = 1, 2, . . . , R \u2212 1, the\n\nentries r, r + R, . . . , r + (B \u2212 1)R of aT\n\nan be obtained by omputing the ir ular onvolution of aB with\n\nthe impulse response of length B ontained in the rth row of F0 . In the remainder of the paper, we will\nsay that the R \u2212 1 FIR \u001clters are de\u001cned by F0 . By allo ating B dedi ated multipliers per FIR \u001clter (one\n36\n\n\fper impulse response tap), we would need a total of (R \u2212 1)B dedi ated multipliers. We will next see that\nthe omplex- onjugate symmetry in the rows of F0 , formulated as Property 2 in Proposition 11, allows to\n\nredu e the number of dedi ated multipliers and the interpolation omplexity by a fa tor of two.\nIn the following, we assume that the multipli ations of a variable omplex-valued operand by a onstant\n\u03b3 \u2208 C and by its omplex onjugate \u03b3 \u2217 an be arried out using the same dedi ated multiplier, and that\n\nthe resulting omplexity is omparable to the omplexity of multipli ation by \u03b3 alone. This is justi\u001ced\n\nas the multipli ation by \u03b3 \u2217, ompared to the multipli ation by \u03b3 , involves the same four underlying realvalued multipli ations and only requires two additional sign \u001dips, whi h have signi\u001c antly smaller omplexity\nthan the real-valued multipli ations. Thus, we an perform multipli ation by the oe\u001e ients [F0 ]r,k+1 and\n[F0 ]R\u2212r,B\u2212k = [F0 ]\u2217r,k+1 through a single dedi ated multiplier (r = 1, 2, . . . , R/2, k = 0, 1, . . . , B/2 \u2212 1).\n\nThis resour e sharing approa h leads to\n\ncIP =\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 \u03c7R B,\n2\n\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 \u03c7C B,\n2\n\nV1 = V2\n\n(62)\n\nV1 6= V2 .\n\nSo far, we assumed that a(s) is interpolated from the B = 2\u2308log(V +1)\u2309 base points in B , resulting in cIP\n\na ording to (62). We will next show that the interpolation omplexity an be further redu ed by using a\nsmaller number of base points B \u2032 < B . Interpolation will be exa t as long as the ondition B \u2032 \u2265 V + 1 is\n\nsatis\u001ced.\n\nAs done above, we assume knowledge of the B samples a(s), s \u2208 B . In the following, however, we require\n\nthat for a given target point tr , the sample a(tr ) is obtained by interpolation from only B \u2032 base points,\n\npi ked from the B elements of B as a fun tion of tr . For simpli ity of exposition, we assume that B \u2032 is even,\n\nand for every tr \u2208 T we hoose the B \u2032 elements of B that are lo ated losest to tr on U . We will next show\nthat the resulting interpolation of a(s) from B to T\n\nan be performed through FIR \u001cltering.\n\nIn the following, we de\u001cne B disjoint subsets Tk of T (satisfying T0 \u222a T1 \u222a . . . \u222a TB\u22121 = T ) and onsider\n\nthe orresponding subsets Bk of B , de\u001cned su h that for all points in Tk , the B \u2032 losest base points are given\nby the elements of Bk (k = 0, 1, . . . , B \u2212 1). We next show that the interpolation matrix orresponding to\n\ninterpolation of a(s) from Bk to Tk is independent of k . To this end, we \u001crst onsider the set of target points\n\nT0 , {t(B\u22121)(R\u22121)+r\u22121 : r = 1, 2, . . . , R\u22121}, ontaining the R\u22121 target points lo ated on U between the base\n\npoints bB\u22121 and b0 . The subset of B ontaining the B \u2032 points that are losest to every point in T0 is given by\n\nB0 , {b0 , b1 , . . . , bB \u2032 /2 , bB\u2212B \u2032 /2 , bB\u2212B \u2032 /2+1 , . . . , bB\u22121 }. Interpolation of a(s) from B0 to T0 involves the base\n\npoint matrix B0 , the target point matrix T0 , and the interpolation matrix T0 B\u20200 , onstru ted as des ribed in\n\nSe tion 2.3. Next, for k = 1, 2, . . . , B\u22121, we denote by Bk and Tk the sets obtained by multiplying all elements\n\nof B0 and T0 , respe tively, by ej2\u03c0k/B. We note that Tk ontains the R\u22121 target points lo ated on U between\n\nthe base points bk\u22121 and bk , and that Bk is the subset of B ontaining the B \u2032 points that are losest to every\n\npoint in Tk . With the unitary matrix Sk , diag((ej2\u03c0k/B )V1 , (ej2\u03c0k/B )V1 \u22121 , . . . , (ej2\u03c0k/B )\u2212V2 ), interpolation\n37\n\n\f\u2020\nof a(s) from Bk to Tk involves the base point matrix Bk = B0 Sk , with pseudoinverse B\u2020k = S\u22121\nk B0 , the target\n\n\u2020\n\u2020\npoint matrix Tk = T0 Sk , and the interpolation matrix Tk B\u2020k = T0 Sk S\u22121\nk B0 = T0 B0 (k = 1, 2, . . . , B \u2212 1).\n\nHen e, the interpolation matrix is independent of k and is the same as in the interpolation of a(s) from B0\nto T0 .\n\nNow, interpolation of a(s) from B to T , with the onstraint that the sample of a(s) at every target point\n\nis omputed only from the samples of a(s) at the B \u2032 losest base points, amounts to performing interpolation\nof a(s) from Bk to Tk for all k = 0, 1, . . . , B \u2212 1, and an be written in a single equation as aT = FaB . Here,\n\nthe (R \u2212 1)B \u00d7 B interpolation matrix F is equal to the RHS of (60), with the (R \u2212 1) \u00d7 B matrix\n\u0002\nF0 = (T0 B\u20200 )1,B \u2032 /2\n\n0\n\n(T0 B\u20200 )B\u2212B \u2032 /2+1,B\n\n\u0003\n\n(63)\n\nwhi h ontains an all-zero submatrix of dimension (R \u2212 1) \u00d7 (B \u2212 B \u2032 ). Hen e, F satis\u001ces Property 1 of\n\nProposition 11, with F0 given by (63). In addition, we state without proof that F0 in (63) satis\u001ces Property 2\n\nof Proposition 11. We an therefore on lude that interpolation from the losest B \u2032 base points maintains the\nstru tural properties of interpolation from all B base points and, as above, an be performed by FIR \u001cltering\nusing R \u2212 1 \u001clters with dedi ated multipliers that exploit the onjugate symmetry in the rows of F0 . Sin e\n\nthe rows of F0 in (63) ontain B \u2212 B \u2032 zeros, the R \u2212 1 impulse responses now have length B \u2032 , and we obtain\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 \u03c7R B \u2032 ,\nV1 = V2\n2\ncIP =\n(64)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 \u03c7C B \u2032 ,\nV\n=\n6\nV\n.\n1\n2\n2\n8.5. Inexa t Interpolation\n\nThe interpolation omplexity (64) of the approa h des ribed in Se tion 8.4 an be further redu ed by\nhoosing B \u2032 to be smaller than V + 1. This omes, however, at the ost of a systemati interpolation error\nand onsequently leads to a trade-o\u001b between interpolation omplexity and interpolation a ura y. In the\nontext of MIMO-OFDM dete tors, it is demonstrated in Se tion 9.1 that the performan e degradation\nresulting from this systemati interpolation error is often negligible. In the following, we propose an ad-ho\nmethod for inexa t interpolation. The basi idea onsists of introdu ing an interpolation error metri and\nformulating a orresponding optimization problem, whi h yields the matrix F0 that de\u001cnes the FIR \u001clters\nfor inexa t interpolation.\nFor simpli ity of exposition, we restri t our dis ussion to inexa t interpolation of Q\u0303(s) \u223c (MT L, MT L)\n\nand R\u0303(s) \u223c (MT L, MT L) with V1 = V2 = MT L, as required in Step 4 of Algorithm II. For random-valued\nMIMO hannel taps H0 , H1 , . . . , HL , we propose to quantify the interpolation error a ording to\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\nX\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\nkQH sn H sn \u2212 R sn k22 \uf8fb\ne(F0 ) , E \uf8f0\nn\u2208D\\IMT\n\n38\n\n(65)\n\n\fwhere the expe tation is taken over H0 , H1 , . . . , HL , and where the dependen e of the RHS of (65) on F0\nis impli it through the fa t that within Algorithm II, the omputation of Q(sn ) and R(sn ) at the tones\nn \u2208 D\\IMT involves interpolation through the FIR \u001clters de\u001cned by F0 . We mention that the metri e(F0 )\n\nin (65) is relevant for MIMO-OFDM sphere de oding, and that minimization of e(F0 ) does not ne essarily lead to optimal dete tion performan e. Other appli ations involving QR de omposition of polynomial\nmatri es may require alternative error metri s.\nFor upsampling from B equidistant base points by a fa tor of R, under the ondition V1 = V2 , the\nmatrix F0 in (63) is a fun tion of N, R, B, B \u2032 , and V1 . Now, we have that N is a \u001cxed system parameter\nand B = 2\u2308log(2MT L+1)\u2309 . Moreover, R is determined by N , B , and D, sin e R is either given by R = N/B\n\nin the ase |D| = N or is a fun tion of B and D in the ase |D| < N . Finally, under a \u001cxed omplexity\n\nbudget (i.e., a given value for cIP ), B \u2032 is onstrained by (64). Now, Q\u0303(s), R\u0303(s) \u223c (MT L, MT L) determines\n\nV1 = MT L, but we propose, instead, to onsider V1 as a variable parameter, so that F0 = F0 (V1 ). The\n\ninterpolation error is then minimized by \u001crst determining\nV1\u2032 ,\n\narg min\n\ne(F0 (V1 ))\n\nV1 \u2208{1,2,...,MT L}\n\nnumeri ally, and then performing interpolation through the FIR \u001clters de\u001cned by F0 (V1\u2032 ).\n\n9. Numeri al Results\nThe results presented so far do not depend on a spe i\u001c QR de omposition method. For the numeri al\nomplexity omparisons presented in this se tion, we will get more spe i\u001c and assume UT-based QR de omposition performed through Givens rotations and oordinate rotation digital omputer (CORDIC) operations\n[18, 19\u2104, whi h is the method of hoi e in VLSI implementations [3, 12\u2104. For A \u2208 CP \u00d7M with P \u2265 M , it was\n\nshown in [3\u2104 that the omplexity of UT-based QR de omposition of A a ording to the standard form (4),\nas required in Algorithms I\u0015III, is given by\n\u00d7M\ncP\n,\nQR\n\n3 2\n1\n(P M + P M 2 ) \u2212 M 3 \u2212 (P 2 \u2212 P + M 2 + M )\n2\n2\n\nand that the omplexity of e\u001e ient UT-based regularized QR de omposition of A a ording to the standard\nform (51), as required in Algorithms I-MMSE and II-MMSE, is given7 by\n\u00d7M\ncP\n,\nMMSE-QR\n\n3 2\n1\n1\n(P M + P M 2 ) \u2212 P 2 + P.\n2\n2\n2\n\n(66)\n\nThe results in [3\u2104 arry over, in a straightforward fashion, to UT-based QR de omposition of the augmented\nmatrix [ AT\n\n\u03b1IM ]T a ording to the standard form (49), as required in Algorithm III-MMSE, to yield\n1\n3\n\u00d7M\nP \u00d7M\ncP\n, cMMSE-QR\n+ P M 2 + P M.\nQR,III-MMSE\n2\n2\n\n7\n\nIn [3\u2104, the last term on the RHS of (66) was erroneously spe i\u001ced as \u2212(1/2)P .\n\n39\n\n\f9.1. E\u001e ient Interpolation and Performan e Degradation\nWe start by quantifying the trade-o\u001b between interpolation omplexity and dete tion performan e, des ribed in Se tion 8.5. Spe i\u001c ally, we evaluate the loss in dete tion performan e as we gradually redu e B \u2032 ,\nand hen e also cIP , in the interpolation of Q\u0303(s) and R\u0303(s), as required by Algorithm II. The orresponding\nanalysis for the interpolation of q\u0303k (s) and r\u0303Tk (s), k = 1, 2, . . . , MT , as required by Algorithm III, is more\ninvolved and does not yield any additional insight into the trade-o\u001b under onsideration. The numeri al\nresults presented in the following demonstrate that for Algorithm II to have smaller omplexity than Algorithm I, setting B \u2032 to a value smaller than V + 1, and hen e a epting a systemati interpolation error, may\nbe ne essary. On the other hand, we will also see that the resulting performan e degradation, in terms of\nboth oded and un oded bit error rate (BER), an be negligible even for values of B \u2032 that are signi\u001c antly\nsmaller than V + 1.\nIn the following, we onsider a MIMO-OFDM system with D = N = 512, MR = 4, and either MT = 2\nor MT = 4, operating over a frequen y-sele tive hannel with L = 15. The data symbols are drawn from\na 16-QAM onstellation. In the oded ase, a rate 1/2 onvolutional ode with onstraint length 7 and\ngenerator polynomials [133o 171o ] is used. The re eiver performs maximum-likelihood dete tion through\nhard-output sphere de oding. Our results are obtained through Monte Carlo simulation, where averaging\nis performed over the hannel impulse response taps H0 , H1 , . . . , HL assumed i.i.d. CN (0, 1/(L + 1)). This\n\nassumption on the hannel statisti s, along with the average transmit power being given by E[cH\nn cn ] = 1\n2\n2\nand the noise varian e \u03c3w\n, implies that the per-antenna re eive signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is 1/\u03c3w\n. The\n\nre eiver employs either Algorithm I or Algorithm II to ompute Q(sn ) and R(sn ) at all tones. We assume\nthat in Step 1 of both algorithms, H(s) \u223c (0, L) is interpolated exa tly from B = L + 1 = 16 equidistant\n\nbase points by FIR \u001cltering. Sin e 0 = V1 6= V2 = L, the orresponding interpolation omplexity per target\npoint is obtained from (62) as cIP,H , (L + 1)\u03c7C /2. With \u03c7C = 1/4, as assumed in Se tion 8.1, we get8\n\ncIP,H = 2. In Step 4 of Algorithm II, we interpolate Q\u0303(s) \u223c (MT L, MT L) and R\u0303(s) \u223c (MT L, MT L),\n\nwith maximum degree V = 2MT L, through FIR \u001cltering from B \u2032 \u2264 B = 2\u2308log(V +1)\u2309 base points. With\n\nV1 = V2 = MT L, the orresponding interpolation omplexity per target point is obtained from (64) as\ncIP,Q\u0303R\u0303 , \u03c7R B \u2032 /2 with \u03c7R = 1/8, as assumed in Se tion 8.1.

We note that for MT = 4, exa t interpolation,\nboth FFT-based and through FIR \u001cltering, results in CII > CI . Hen e, in this ase inexa t interpolation\nis ne essary to obtain omplexity savings of Algorithm II over Algorithm I. In ontrast, for MT = 2,\nAlgorithm II exhibits lower omplexity than Algorithm I even in the ase of exa t interpolation.\nFigs. 3a and 3b show the resulting BER performan e for MT = 2 and MT = 4, respe tively, both for the\noded and the un oded ase. For un oded transmission and inexa t interpolation, we observe an error \u001door\nat high SNR whi h rises with de reasing B \u2032 . For MT = 2 and un oded transmission, we an see in Fig. 3a\nand Table 2, respe tively, that an interpolation \u001clter length of B \u2032 = 8 results in negligible performan e loss\nfor SNR values of up to 18 dB, and yields omplexity savings of Algorithm II over Algorithm I of 66%.\nChoosing B \u2032 = 16 yields lose-to-optimum performan e for SNR values of up to 24 dB and omplexity\nsavings of 59%. For MT = 4 and un oded transmission, Fig. 3b and Table 2 show that the interpolation\n\u001clter length an be shortened from B \u2032 = 128 to B \u2032 = 8, leading to omplexity savings of Algorithm II over\nAlgorithm I of 50%, at virtually no performan e loss in the SNR range of up to 21 dB. Setting B \u2032 = 32\nresults in a performan e loss, ompared to exa t interpolation, of less than 1 dB at BER = 10\u22126 and in\nomplexity savings of 29%. In the oded ase, both for MT = 2 and MT = 4, we an see in Figs. 3a and 3b\nthat the BER urves for Algorithm II, for all values of B \u2032 under onsideration, essentially overlap with the\n41\n\n\f10\n\n0\n\n10\n\n0\n\nexact\n\nexact\n\n-1\n\n-1\n\n10\n\n10\n\n-2\n\nBit Error Rate\n\nBit Error Rate\n\n-2\n\n10\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n-3\n\n10\n\n-4\n\n10\n\n10\n\n-5\n\n-5\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\n\n10\n\n-6\n\n0\n\n6\n\n12\n\n18\nSNR [dB]\n\n24\n\n30\n\n10\n\n36\n\n(a)\n\n-6\n\n0\n\n6\n\n12\n\n18\nSNR [dB]\n\n24\n\n30\n\n36\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 3: Bit error rates as a fun tion of SNR for di\u001berent interpolation \u001clter lengths, with and without hannel oding, for\n(a) MT = 2 and (b) MT = 4. The results orresponding to exa t QR de omposition are provided for referen e.\n\norresponding urves for Algorithm I for BERs down to 10\u22126. This observation suggests that for a given\ntarget BER and a given tolerated performan e loss of Algorithm II over Algorithm I, the use of hannel\noding allows to employ signi\u001c antly shorter interpolation \u001clters ( orresponding to a smaller cIP,Q\u0303R\u0303 and\nhen e to a lower CII , whi h in turn implies higher savings of Algorithm II over Algorithm I) than in the\nun oded ase. We on lude that in the pra ti ally relevant ase of oded transmission, omplexity savings\nof Algorithm II over Algorithm I an be obtained at negligible dete tion performan e loss.\n9.2. Algorithm Complexity Comparisons\nThe dis ussion in Se tion 8 and the numeri al results in Se tion 9.1 demonstrated that for the ase of\nupsampling from equidistant base points, small values of cIP an be a hieved and inexa t interpolation does\nnot ne essarily indu e a signi\u001c ant dete tion performan e loss. Therefore, in the following we assume that\nfor all k = 1, 2, . . . , MT , the set Ik is su h that S(Ik ) ontains Bk = |Ik | = 2\u2308log2 (2kL+1)\u2309 base points that\nare equidistant on U , and assume that cIP = 2. The latter assumption is in line with the values of cIP,H\nand cIP,Q\u0303R\u0303 found in Se tion 9.1.\n\nFor D = 500, L = 15, and di\u001berent values of MT and MR , Fig. 4a shows the omplexity of Algorithms II\nand III as per entage of the omplexity of Algorithm I. We observe savings of Algorithms II and III over\nAlgorithm I as high as 48% and 62%, respe tively. Furthermore, we an see that Algorithm III exhibits\na lower omplexity than Algorithm II in all onsidered on\u001cgurations. We note that the latter behavior\nis a onsequen e of the small value of cIP and of Algorithm III, with respe t to Algorithm II, trading a\nlower QR de omposition ost against a higher interpolation ost. Moreover, we observe that the savings\nof Algorithms II and III over Algorithm I are more pronoun ed for larger MR \u2212 MT . For the spe ial ase\n42\n\n\f100\n\n90\n\n90\nComplexity (in % of Alg.

We an therefore on lude that interpolation-based QR de omposition, provided that the omplexity of interpolation is su\u001e iently small, yields fundamental omplexity\nsavings.\nFor D = 500, MT = MR , and di\u001berent values of L, Fig. 5a shows the omplexity of Algorithms II-MMSE\nand III-MMSE as per entage of the omplexity of Algorithm I-MMSE. The fa t (whi h also arries over\nto the savings of Algorithms II and III over Algorithm I) that the savings of Algorithms II-MMSE and\nIII-MMSE over Algorithm I-MMSE are more pronoun ed for smaller values of L is a onsequen e of Bk\nbeing an in reasing fun tion of L. In Fig. 5a, we an see that despite the low interpolation omplexity\nimplied by cIP = 2, Algorithm III-MMSE may exhibit a higher omplexity than Algorithm II-MMSE. This\nis a onsequen e of the fa t that for some values of MT , MR , and L, the overall omplexity of the UTbased QR de ompositions with standard form (49) required in Algorithm III-MMSE is larger than the\noverall omplexity of the e\u001e ient UT-based regularized MMSE-QR de ompositions with standard form (51)\nrequired in Algorithm II-MMSE.\nFinally, Fig. 5b shows the absolute omplexity of Algorithms I\u0015III and I-MMSE through III-MMSE as a\nfun tion of D, for MT = 3, MR = 4, and L = 15. We observe that the omplexity savings of Algorithms II\nand III over Algorithm I and the savings of Algorithms II-MMSE and III-MMSE over Algorithm I-MMSE\ngrow linearly in D. This behavior was predi ted for Algorithms I and II by the analysis in Se tion 6.4, where\nwe showed that CI \u2212 CII is an a\u001ene fun tion of D and is positive for small cIP and large D.\n43\n\n\f120\n\n80\n\nComplexity (in % of Alg.

Con lusions and Outlook\nOn the basis of a new result on the QR de omposition of LP matri es, we formulated interpolation-based\nalgorithms for omputationally e\u001e ient QR de omposition of polynomial matri es that are oversampled on\nthe unit ir le. These algorithms are of pra ti al relevan e as they allow for an (often drasti ) redu tion of the\nre eiver omplexity in MIMO-OFDM systems. Using a omplexity metri relevant for VLSI implementations,\nwe demonstrated signi\u001c ant and fundamental omplexity savings of the proposed new lass of algorithms\nover brute-for e per-tone QR de omposition. The savings are more pronoun ed for larger numbers of\ndata- arrying tones and smaller hannel orders. We furthermore provided strategies for low- omplexity\ninterpolation exploiting the spe i\u001c stru ture of the problem at hand.\nThe fa t that the maximum degree of the LP matri es Q\u0303(s) and R\u0303(s) is 2MT L, although the polynomial\nMIMO transfer fun tion matrix H(s) has maximum degree L, gives rise to the following open questions:\n\u2022 Is the mapping M optimal in the sense of delivering LP matri es with the lowest maximum degree?\n\u2022 Would interpolation-based algorithms for QR de omposition that expli itly make use of the unitarity\n\nof Q(s) allow to further redu e the number of base points required and hen e lead to further omplexity\nsavings?\n\nAdditional hallenges in lude the extension of the ideas presented in this paper to sparse hannel impulse\nresponses, for whi h only few of the impulse response tap matri es are nonzero.\n\n44\n\n\fA knowledgments\nThe authors would like to thank Andreas Burg and Simon Haene for many inspiring and helpful dis ussions, Jan Hansen and Moritz Borgmann for their ontributions in early stages of this work, and Gerhard\nDoblinger for bringing [15\u2104 to their attention.\n\nReferen es\n[1\u2104 M.
