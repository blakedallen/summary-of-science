In ref. [1] it was argued that such a scenario\ncan explain not only the positron/electron excess recently\nindicated in the 10-100 GeV region by the PAMELA [2]\nand (to some extent) HEAT [3] experiments, and a similar one in the 500-800 GeV region seen by ATIC [4] and\nPPB-BETS [5], but also the 511 keV gamma rays observed by INTEGRAL/SPI [6, 7], the WMAP haze [8]\nand the annual modulation observed by DAMA/LIBRA\n[9]. The connections were further explored in [10]. The\ncommon link between them is that they can be explained\nin terms of DM undergoing enhanced scattering and subsequent annihilation into light bosons which decay to\ne+ e\u2212 [11], or else exciting a DM state with a small mass\nsplitting above the ground state, which might decay back\nto the ground state and e+ e\u2212 if the splitting is greater\nthan 2me . In the case of DAMA, the mass splitting provides the kinematics which would enable DAMA to be\nmore sensitive than other experiments to a necessarily inelastic collision. The ideas of excited dark matter (XDM)\n[12] and inelastic dark matter (IDM) [13] were proposed\nbefore ref. [1], but the latter took the step of trying to\nunify them into an appealing theoretical framework, and\nto use it to also explain the excess positron/electron results of PAMELA/ATIC.\n\nThe unified description of dark matter has one shortcoming, however. In ref. [14], it was shown that the XDM\nmechanism falls short of being able to reproduce the experimental observation by nearly three orders of magnitude, even if the galactic DM scattering cross section \u03c3gal\nsaturates the unitarity limit in the s-wave contribution.\nThe main loophole for circumventing this conclusion was\nto hope that higher-l partial waves could increase \u03c3gal\nby a factor of 300. Such an enhancement was argued to\nbe unlikely in ref. [14], and we will show that this argument is borne out in the class of models proposed by ref.\n[1]. Thus the XDM explanation of the 511 keV excess\nremains unrealized.1\nWe note that the 511 keV anomaly is not just the finding of the INTEGRAL experiment, but it was first observed in 1972, and has been seen in four subsequent\nballoon- and satellite-borne experiments [7]. The observation is thus quite credible, and so far is lacking any\n\n1\n\nThis conclusion depends on the small error bars for the necessary\nvalue of \u03c3gal estimated by ref. [17]. However there seems to be a\nlarger uncertainty in the DM density at the center of the galaxy,\nnc . Since positron production in the XDM scenario scales like\nn2c , the original XDM idea with \u03b4M \u223c\n= me might be salvaged\nif nc is greater by a factor of 17 (even more if the unitarity\nbound is not saturated) than in the model found to be preferred\nin the best fit to the INTEGRAL data by ref. [17]. It would\nbe worthwhile, though beyond the scope of the present work, to\nfurther investigate this point.\n\n\f2\n\n\u03c72\n\u03c71 \u03b4M ~100 keV\n\n\u03c72\n\n\u2206 M ~1 MeV\n\n\u03c71\n\u03c70\n\n\u03c70\n\ne+ e\u2212\n1\n2\n\n\u03b4M ~100 keV\n\nFIG. 1: Left: DM spectrum needed in present work to account for the INTEGRAL/SPI observations; right: spectrum\nsuggested by ref. [1].\n\nhighly convincing astrophysical or particle physics explanation, although attempts have been made using positron\nemission from low-mass x-ray binaries (LMXB's) [15], or\nannihilation of light MeV-scale dark matter (see for example [16, 17]) as well as decaying relics [14, 18]. The\nLMXB hypothesis is predicated on a supposed correlation between the asymmetry in the disk component of\nthe 511 keV gamma rays and the distribution of bright\nLMXB's, but this has been criticized on several grounds\nin ref. [19] (although the discrepancies might be ameliorated if positrons produced in the disk can be transported\nto the bulge before annihilating [20]). Therefore it is still\ninteresting to find a technically natural particle physics\nexplanation for the 511 keV line, regardless of the other\nexperimental anomalies. This was the primary motivation for the present work. The fact that our positive finding for the INTEGRAL anomaly is consistent with the\ngeneral framework outlined in ref. [1], for also explaining\nthe other experiments (apart from DAMA), heightens its\ninterest.\nOur new twist for making XDM viable is to have a mass\nsplitting \u03b4M which is much smaller than me between the\nmiddle DM state and the heaviest one, as illustrated in\nfigure 1. These are assumed to be Majorana fermions,\n\u03c7i . We will design the model so that \u03c71 cannot decay\ndirectly to the ground state \u03c70 ; thus both \u03c70 and \u03c71\nare stable. \u03c71 undergoes Sommerfeld-enhanced scattering [1, 21, 22, 23] at the galactic center (where the DM\ndensity is highest) through multiple exchange of a light\ngauge boson B\u03bc with off-diagonal coupling \u03c7\u03042 \u03b3 \u03bc B\u03bc \u03c71 ,\nas envisioned in ref. [1]. The produced \u03c72 states subsequently decay through another vector B\u03bc\u2032 which mixes\nwith the photon to produce e+ e\u2212 . These processes are\nshown in figure 2. The key ingredient which makes the\nscattering efficient enough is the small mass splitting \u03b4M .\nPrevious attempts to implement the XDM mechanism\nhave failed because a larger splitting \u223c me was assumed,\nand this makes the excitation rate too small. The figure\nof merit is the ratio of the predicted rate of e+ production to that observed, in the lth partial wave, assuming\nthe unitarity bound is saturated [14]:\nRl = 4.5 \u00d7 10\n\n\u22124\n\n2l + 1\nv0\n\n\u0012\n\n500 GeV\nM\n\n\u00134\n\n2\n\ne\u22122me /Mv0\n\n(1)\n\n\u03c71\n\n\u03c70\n\n1\n2\n\nB\u03bc'\n\n1\n2\n\n1\n2\n\n(b)\n\n(a)\n\n\u03c72\n\n\u03c72\n\n\u2206 M ~1 MeV\n\nB\u03bc\n\n\u03c71\n\n\u03c72\n\nFIG. 2: Left: Sommerfeld-enhanced scattering \u03c71 \u03c71 \u2192 \u03c72 \u03c72 .\nRight: decay \u03c72 \u2192 \u03c70 e+ e\u2212 .\n\nIt is suppressed by the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution\nat the threshold for production of the excited state. Eq.\n(1) was predicated on the assumption that the kinetic\nenergy of each DM particle must be sufficient to produce\none electron or positron. Since the characteristic DM velocity v0 is fixed, M must be sufficiently large to avoid\nthe Boltzmann suppression, but the rate also scales like\nM \u22124 . Even with the optimal value of M = me /2v02 , one\nwould need to more than double the estimated value of\nv0 = 6 \u00d7 10\u22124 c to make R0 = 1. Such a large change\nseems to be well outside the range of uncertainty in\nthe current understanding of the DM velocity distribution. However in our scenario, me is replaced by the\nsmaller \u03b4M , which P\ncan significantly ease this tension.\nWe will show that l Rl can be 1 as required without\nchanging v0 , and keeping M \u223c 500 GeV as desired for\n< 100 keV. It is intriguing that\nPAMELA/ATIC, if \u03b4M \u223c\nthe same splitting has been advocated previously to account for the DAMA signal. However we will show that\nthe need for stability of \u03c71 means that it cannot interact with baryons or leptons at detectable levels; thus our\nproposal does not seem to be compatible with the IDM\nexplanation for DAMA.\nIn the remainder of the paper we will give details of the\ncomputation of the excitation rate (section II), tighten\nthe case against the large mass gap \u03b4M = me scenario in\nsection III, and show how a smaller value \u03b4M \u223c 100\nkeV can improve the situation in section IV. In section V we build a simple particle physics model of DM\nwhich can accommodate our findings, and also address\nthe PAMELA/ATIC/PPB-BETS observations. Section\nVI gives a brief account of the cosmological implications\nof the model. Conclusions are given in section VII.\n\nII.\n\nMETHODOLOGY\n\nTo obtain the desired result for the 511 keV signal, it\nis important to nearly saturate the unitarity bound in at\nleast one partial wave (or to have significant scattering\nup to high values of l, but we will show that this does\n\n\f3\nnot seem to be possible in the present context). The\nSommerfeld enhancement which can occur at low DM\nvelocities is crucial for getting such strong scattering. We\nfollow the quantum mechanical treatment of appendix\nA.4 of ref. [1] to compute this effect.\nBecause the gauge coupling g \u03c7\u03042 B\u03bc \u03b3 \u03bc \u03c71 is assumed to\nbe off-diagonal, we have two states |1i = |\u03c71 , \u03c71 i, |2i =\n|\u03c72 , \u03c72 i, whose interaction Hamiltonian has the matrix\nform\n\u0013\n\u0012\n0\n\u2212\u03b1e\u2212\u03bcr /r\n(2)\nVij =\n\u2212\u03b1e\u2212\u03bcr /r\n2\u03b4M\nwhere \u03b1 = g 2 /4\u03c0 and \u03bc is the mass of B\u03bc . The wave function for the two-state system (with components\nlabeled\nP\ni\n(r),\nby index i) in the CM frame is \u03a8i = l Pl (cos \u03b8)Rkl\nwhere k is the initial momentum.

We\nconsidered the limit in which the B\u03bc gauge boson mass\n\u03bc can be neglected. Otherwise the range of the interaction is reduced; this can only decrease the contribution\nfrom higher-l partial waves, which correspond to scattering at large impact parameter. In that case, the relevant\ndimensionless parameter turns out to be\n\u0393\u2261\n\nFor the numerical solution it is useful to rescale r = (\u03b1/2\u03b4M )x\nand define the dimensionless variables \u0393 = M1 \u03b12 /(2\u03b4M ), \u03a5 =\n(\u03b1k/2\u03b4M )2 , \u03b7 = \u03b1\u03bc/2\u03b4M , so that the Schr\u00f6dinger equation\ntakes the form \u2212\u03a6\u2032\u2032 + [l(l + 1)/x2 + \u0393V\u0302 ]\u03a6 = \u03a5\u03a6, with the di\u2212\u03b7x\n\n0\n\u2212e\n/x\nmensionless potential V\u0302 = ( \u2212e\u2212\u03b7x\n). We must have\n/x\n1\n\u03a5 > \u0393 for the initial state to have enough energy to produce the\nheavier |\u03c72 , \u03c72 i final state.\n\nM1 \u03b12\n2\u03b4M\n\n(6)\n\n(see footnote 2.) For \u0393 \u226b 1, the s-wave dominates the\ncross-section, while for \u0393 \u226a 1, a range of partial waves\ncontribute significantly. However, in the latter case even\nthe largest contributions fall short of the needed unitarity\nlimit, so the total cross section is not actually enhanced.\nWorking at the optimal mass M = me /2v02 , we have\ncomputed\nZ uesc\nX\n\u2032\nut\ndu e\u2212u fl (u)\n(7)\nI \u2261e\n(2l + 1)\nl\n\nin the lth partial wave.

Doing so modifies the unitarity-saturating estimate (1) to read\nRl \u2192 4.5 \u00d7 10\u22124\n\nescape velocity at r = 0.4 kpc, the outer edge of the region where INTEGRAL sees excess \u03b3 emission [12]. Since\nv0 = 180 km/s, the error in extending the upper limit of\nintegration to \u221e is small.\n\nut\n\n[see eq. (5)] as a function\nof \u0393. This quantity would take\nP\nthe limiting value\nl (2l + 1) for all the partial waves\nwhich reach the unitarity limit fl = 1. At the optimal\nmass M = me /2v02 , ut = 4, and ref. [14] shows that I \u2032\nshould have the value (3.4 \u00d7 10\u22123 )\u22121 \u223c\n= 300 in order to\nmatch the INTEGRAL observations. Fig. 3 shows that\nin the actual model, I \u2032 reaches a maximum value of 0.3\nnear \u0393 = 0.5, far below what is needed.\nWe have thus established that the high-l loophole for\nthe large \u03b4M scenario does not work. Another way of\nenhancing the effect would be to take advantage of its\nstrong dependence on v0 . One would need to boost v0 by\nthe factor (0.3 \u00d7 3.4 \u00d7 10\u22123 )\u22121/7 \u223c\n= 2.7, giving v0 = 480\nkm/s instead of 180 km/s. On the other hand, more\n\n3\n\nIn terms of ref.

Ref.

(7), as a function of \u0393 \u2261 M1 \u03b12 /2\u03b4M , in the disfavored case \u03b4M = me ,\nwhere the new gauge boson is taken to be massless and M\nis optimized. The maximum enhancement is too small to\nmatch observations. Right: integrands for successive partial\nwaves contributing to I \u2032 , versus u/a, where u = v 2 /v02 and\na = 2\u03b4M/M v02 . One would need significant contributions\nfrom many more partial waves to make I \u2032 large enough.\n\nsophisticated estimates of the dark matter distribution\nindicate that v0 is smaller than the fiducial value, rather\nthan larger, in the center of the galaxy [14, 17]. Different models of the DM distribution function n(r, v)\ngive radially-dependent average velocities v0 (r) which decrease toward r = 0. Therefore using the constant value\nfor v0 which best describes the bulk of the galaxy already overestimates the efficiency of DM excitation near\nthe center, and the large \u03b4M possibility seems to be ruled\nout (see however footnote 1).\n\nIV.\n\n\u0393 = 10, \u03b7 = 1.2\n\n2\n\n0.3\n\n0.1\n\n0.15\n\nl = 10\n\nl=0\n\nTHE CASE OF SMALL \u03b4M\n\nNow we turn to the main point, that smaller values of\nthe DM mass splitting \u03b4M \u223c 100 keV can overcome the\nproblem of too small a signal, without any need for increasing the DM velocity v0 . Redoing the analysis of ref.\n[14] for general \u03b4M , one finds that for the optimal DM\nmass, Rl is enhanced by an extra factor of (me /\u03b4M )4 .\nWe can therefore achieve the desired effect if unitarity\nis nearly saturated only in the s-wave (or other low-l\ncontributions), with \u03b4M = 0.24 me = 120 keV. This estimate applies for the optimal mass M = \u03b4M/2v02 = 170\nGeV. However we can make the mechanism work at larger\nM , as desired for getting the unified explanation of the\nPAMELA/ATIC/PPB-BETS observations [1], by making \u03b4M only moderately smaller, as we will now show.\nWe have done a preliminary exploration of the parameter space, to see what can be achieved in the concrete\nframework at hand. We defer a more comprehensive analysis to the future; here we will just present a working\nexample. To get a large enough effect, it is important to\nvary the mass \u03bc of the exchanged gauge boson B\u03bc . Physically, this is due to resonant scattering when a bound\nstate of nearly zero energy forms [1, 21, 23]. This effect\nis only possible for a finite-range potential such as the\nYukawa type. Generally, we find enhanced scattering for\nlarger values of \u0393 = M1 \u03b12 /2\u03b4M, which is not surprising\nsince the interaction strength is \u03b1, and there is an optimal\n\nl=2\n\nI\n1\n\n0.5\n\nl=1\nl=0\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\na = 2\u03b4 M / (M v02)\nFIG. 4: Enhancement factor I \u2261 e\u2212ut I \u2032 = e\u2212a I \u2032 versus a \u2261\n2\u03b4M/(M v02 ) for the small \u03b4M model, with \u0393 = 10, \u03b7 = 1.2.\nSuccessive contributions from partial waves l = 0 \u2212 10 are\nshown. I = 1.3 (dotted line) is the value indicated by the\nINTEGRAL observations.\n\n(though not sharply peaked) value of the dimensionless\nparameter\n\u03b7 \u2261 \u03b1\u03bc/2\u03b4M\n\n(8)\n\ngiving the resonant effect.\nAs an example, we present the case where \u0393 = 10,\n\u03b7 = 1.2. We consider the quantity I \u2261 e\u2212ut I \u2032 = e\u2212a I \u2032\nrather than I \u2032 of eq. (7), where a \u2261 2\u03b4M/(M v02 ). In the\nlarge \u03b4M scenario, the best one could do was to optimize\nM such that a = 4, but for small \u03b4M , we can obtain much\nlarger results at smaller values of a. In contrast to the\nlarge \u03b4M case, we can hold M fixed at a a value which is\nlarger than optimum explaining for the 511 keV line, but\nmore interesting for simultaneously explaining the other\npotentially DM-related anomalies. From eq. (5) it follows\nthat at M = 500 GeV and v0 /c = 0.0006, one only needs\nI = 1.3 to explain the INTEGRAL observations.\nThe enhancement factor I is plotted as a function a in\nfigure 4, where the convergence of the successive partial\nwave contributions is shown. The needed value of I =\n1.3 can be obtained for a = 0.95. For M = 500 GeV\nand v0 /c = 0.0006, this implies the mass splitting \u03b4M =\n86 keV. From \u0393 = 10 and \u03b7 = 1.2, we infer that the\nfine-structure constant of the new gauge coupling is \u03b1 =\n0.0017, and the mass of the gauge boson B\u03bc is \u03bc = 120\nMeV.\nSo far, we have assumed that the initial state \u03c71 has a\nparticular number density, namely that which was used\nin the analysis of [17] to determine the cross section\n\u03c3gal = 10\u221228 (M1 /TeV)2 cm2 needed to explain the INTEGRAL anomaly. However, with three nearly degenerate DM states, one expects the \u03c71 density to be 1/3 this\nvalue, given that \u03c72 decayed into \u03c70 and not \u03c71 . The signal is proportional to the integral of h\u03c3gal vrel in2 (r) along\nour line of sight, so this would require the cross section\nto be nine times higher than we have assumed. The ad-\n\n\f5\nditional suppression can be counteracted if the DM density in the central region r < 0.4 kpc is three times higher\nthan assumed in the analysis of ref. [17]. Even apart from\nany uncertainties in the shape of n(r), we note that it is\nnormalized to the local energy density n(8.5 kpc) = 0.3\nGeV/cm3 , which is estimated to be uncertain by a factor of 2 in the upward direction [24]. If this uncertainty\nworks in our favor, we only need an additional factor of\n1.5 enhancement in the central region. This is a modest\nshortfall, since in the four models considered by ref. [17],\nn(0.4 kpc) varies by a factor of 27. Thus the smaller \u03c71\ndensity does not seem to pose a serious problem for the\nmodel. On the other hand, the missing factor of 300 in\nthe large \u03b4M case looks more daunting.\nWe have also neglected the probable r-dependence of\nv0 (r) discussed at the end of the previous section, which\nalso tends to reduce the predicted signal. There is not yet\na consensus on the precise form of v0 (r), but if it proves\nto give a significant reduction, this can be compensated\nto some extent by taking more optimal (smaller) values\nof the DM mass. It is also possible that more favorable\nexamples at large M1 exist, which would make it interesting to perform a wider and more systematic search of\nthe model parameter space (\u0393, \u03b7) than we have been able\nto do so far.\n\nV.\n\nATIC AND MODEL BUILDING\n\nThe simplest and most theoretically appealing way of\ngetting three DM states \u03c7i and several gauge bosons is\nto assume that the gauge symmetry is SU(2) and that \u03c7i\ntransforms as a triplet. We will now explore the consequences of this hypothesis, with particular attention to\nits implications for the ATIC/PPB-BETS excess e+ e\u2212 at\n300-800 GeV. Of course we will also maintain all ingredients needed for our successful explanation of the 511 keV\nanomaly.\nAlready to explain INTEGRAL, we required two gauge\nbosons, B which couples to \u03c71 \u03c72 to facilitate \u03c71 \u03c71 \u2192\n\u03c72 \u03c72 , and B \u2032 which mixes with the photon and mediates the decay \u03c72 \u2192 \u03c70 e+ e\u2212 . However, with only these\nstates, it is difficult to produce a rather sharply-peaked\nexcess of high-energy leptons on top of a lower energy\ncontinuum, which is suggested by the ATIC data and\nwhich we have reproduced in figure 5. (The PPB-BETS\ndata are consistent, but not so strongly suggestive of the\npeak.) The process specified by ref. [1] in this regard is\nshown in fig. 6, where the final state B \u2032 bosons subsequently decay to e+ e\u2212 . The annihilation initially produces back-to-back B \u2032 s, each carrying energy M1 , which\nshould give a leptonic spectrum that is rather uniformly\ndistributed in energy. It would be desirable to have an additional channel which produces a single nearly monoenergetic e+ e\u2212 pair, each lepton having energy M1 . Such a\nspike would be significantly broadened by Coulomb scattering of the primary particles in the galactic medium\n[25]-[28], possibly giving the peak-like shape in the ATIC\n\nFIG. 5: Energy spectrum of e+ e\u2212 observed by ATIC (solid\ncircles), taken from ref. [4].\n\ndata. We will come back to this issue in the next section.\nLet us show how a simple SU(2) model could account\nfor the observations. If \u03c7a is a real triplet, its gauge\ninteractions are\ng\u01ebabc \u03c7\u0304a Bb\u03bc \u03b3\u03bc \u03c7c\n\n(9)\n\nLetting a, b, c = 0, 1, 2, then in the previous notation,\nB0 = B, B1 = B \u2032 , B2 = B \u2032\u2032 . A simple way to get\nkinetic mixing of the photon with B \u2032 is by including a\nHiggs triplet \u2206a in the dark sector, and the dimension-5\noperator\n1 \u03bc\u03bd a\nY B\u03bc\u03bd \u2206a\n\u039b\n\n(10)\n\nwhere Y \u03bc\u03bd is the field strength of the SM weak hypercharge gauge field. If we assume that only \u22061 gets a\nVEV, this generates the required mixing of B \u2032 with the\nphoton and the Z boson. It is straightforward to work\nout the transformation that diagonalizes the kinetic term\n\nB\u03bc\u2032\n\nB\u03bc\u2032\n2\n1\n\n\u03c70\n2\n1\n\n1\n2\n\n\u03c71\n\n1\n2\n\nB\u03bc\n\n\u03c71\n\nFIG. 6: Sommerfeld-enhanced annihilation channel for explaining the PAMELA/ATIC/PPB-BETS anomalies.

If \u03bc\u2032 is the mass of\nthe B \u2032 , we find that the flavor states B \u2032 , A, Z are related\nto the mass eigenstates B\u0303 \u2032 , \u1ef8 , Z\u0303 by\n\u2032\n\n\u03c70\n\n2\n\nA = \u00c3 \u2212 \u01eb cos \u03b8W B\u0303 + O(\u01eb )\n\nB \u2032 = B\u0303 \u2032 + \u01eb sin \u03b8W Z\u0303 + O(\u01eb2 )\n\u03bc\u20322\nZ = Z\u0303 \u2212 \u01eb sin \u03b8W 2 B\u0303 \u2032 + O(\u01eb2 )\nmz\n\nwhere \u01eb \u2261 2\u22061 /\u039b and \u03b8W is the Weinberg angle. It is\nimportant for this class of models that B \u2032 does not mix\nwith the photon A at O(\u01eb) [in fact neither does it mix\nat higher orders], because otherwise \u03c72 \u03c70 would acquire\na coupling to A which would be just as strong as the\ncoupling of B \u2032 to e+ e\u2212 . In that case, INTEGRAL would\nobserve a narrow line from \u03c72 \u2192 \u03c70 \u03b3 at energy \u03b4M \u223c 1\nMeV, in addition to that at 511 keV, but this of course\nhas not been seen. The A-B\u0303 \u2032 mixing implies a decay\nrate of \u03c4 \u22121 \u223c \u03b1em \u03b1M \u01eb2 (me /\u03bc)4 for \u03c72 \u2192 \u03c70 e+ e\u2212 , and\na corresponding lifetime of order 10\u22125 s if \u01eb \u223c 10\u22124 . For\n\u01eb \u223c 10\u22124 and h\u22061 i \u223c 10 GeV as we will find below, the\nscale \u039b is \u223c 50 TeV.\nWith the breaking pattern h\u2206a i = \u03b4a1 \u2206 needed in eq.\n(10), the kinetic term (D\u03bc \u2206)2 of the triplet only gives\nmass terms for B and B \u2032\u2032 ,\ng 2 [\u2206a \u2206a Bb Bb \u2212 (\u2206a Ba )2 ] = g 2 \u22062 (B 2 + B \u2032\u20322 )\n\n\u03c71\n\n(11)\n\n(12)\n\n(where g is the dark SU(2) gauge coupling), so we must\nalso include symmetry breaking from another new Higgs\nfield. One simple possibility is a symmetric traceless tensor, \u03a3ab , the 5D representation, whose VEV is only in\nthe \u03a302 = \u03a320 or \u03a300 = \u2212\u03a322 components. In fact, a\nglobal rotation around the 1 direction (which is the subgroup of SU(2) left unbroken by our choice of h\u22061 i as\nthe triplet VEV) can conveniently put the 5-plet VEV in\nthe diagonal \u03a300 = \u2212\u03a322 components alone. The group\ngenerators in the 5D representation can be written as\nd\n= i(\u01ebadc \u03b4be + \u01ebbde \u03b4ac ).

To get the desired\nradiative mass splittings of the \u03c7's below, we will need\nto assume that \u2206 < \u03a3, so that \u03bc < \u03bc\u2032 .\nAn important property of the interaction (9) (and indeed all the interactions in our model) is that it preserves\nthe Z2 symmetry B \u2192 \u2212B, B \u2032\u2032 \u2192 \u2212B \u2032\u2032 , \u03c71 \u2192 \u2212\u03c71\nwhich is needed to keep \u03c71 stable, if we assume that\n\u22060 and \u22062 are also charged under the Z2 . The discrete symmetry is thus unbroken by the VEV of \u22061 .\nNote that the nonabelian cubic and quartic interactions\nof the gauge bosons have the schematic form BB \u2032 B \u2032\u2032 and\n(B 2 + B \u2032\u20322 )B \u20322 , which also respect the Z2 symmetry.

Therefore even\nthough the excitation \u03c71 \u2192 \u03c72 has the right kinematics\nfor the IDM explanation of DAMA, the putatively exchanged B-B \u2032\u2032 boson cannot interact with the detector\n(nor can \u03c70 \u2192 \u03c71 work, both for this reason and because\nof the larger mass splitting). The remaining excitation\n\u03c70 \u2192 \u03c72 is possible from the point of view of the interactions of the exchanged B \u2032 boson, but the mass splitting\n\u223c 2me is too large for it to proceed at a detectable rate.\nNext we consider the spectrum of the DM triplet. The\ntree level mass M \u03c7\u0304a \u03c7a gets split by 21 \u03b1(\u03bc\u2032 \u2212\u03bc) [29] by the\ndiagrams of fig. 7.4 We are assuming that \u03bc < \u03bc\u2032 since, as\nwe will show, this is what gives the desired DM spectrum.\nFigure 7 indicates that the radiative correction gives \u03c71 a\nmass which is larger than that of \u03c70 and \u03c72 by 21 \u03b1(\u03bc\u2032 \u2212\u03bc),\nbut \u03c70 and \u03c72 but remain degenerate with each other.\nWe can break the remaining degeneracy using the same\nVEV of the 5-plet as in eq. (13) by including the Yukawa\ninteraction\nh\u03a3ab \u03c7\u0304a \u03c7b\n\n(14)\n\nThis splits \u03c70,2 by \u00b1h\u03a3.

Using the value \u03b1 = 1.7 \u00d7 10\u22123 suggested\nby our analysis of the INTEGRAL signal, and assuming\nthat \u2206 = \u03a3/2 for example, we get the required spectrum\nwith \u03a3 \u223c\n= 11.4 GeV, \u2206 \u223c\n= 5.7 GeV, h \u223c\n= 4.5 \u00d7 10\u22125 .\n\n4\n\nIt is important to put the external DM states on shell to get the\ncorrect result.\n\n\f7\nWe can easily construct a potential for the Higgs sector\nwhich leads to the desired symmetry breaking pattern:\n\nB\u03bcl\n\nV = \u03bb1 ( 21 \u03a3ab \u03a3ab \u2212 \u03a32 )2 + \u03bb2 (\u2206a \u2206a \u2212 \u22062 )2\n+ \u03bb3 \u2206a \u03a3ab \u03a3bc \u2206c\n(16)\n\nm\n\n\u03c7k\n\ng\n\ng\n\nm\n\nB\u03bcl\n\nB\u03bd\n\ng\n\nB\u03bd\n\ng\n\ng\n\n+\n\n+\ng\n\nTo see that this can work, first consider the limit \u03bb3 = 0.\nThe VEV of \u2206 can always be rotated into the \u22061 direction by a global SU(2) transformation, while the VEV\nof \u03a3 has no preferred orientation. When \u03bb3 is turned\non, h\u03a3ab i prefers to have the elements in the first row\nand column vanish, h\u03a31a i = h\u03a3a1 i = 0, so that the \u03bb3\nterm remains zero. We can still perform a global rotation around the 1 axis to make h\u03a302 i = h\u03a320 i vanish; this\nrotation leaves h\u2206a i invariant.\nTo summarize, this model is extremely simple: it needs\na new SU(2) (not SU(2)\u00d7U(1) [29]) in the dark sector, broken by a new Higgs triplet and 5-plet, and a\ndimension-5 coupling which induces mixing between the\nphoton and the new B \u2032 gauge boson. These ingredients\neasily give us the desired mass spectrum, fig. 1(a), and\ncoupling of one of the gauge bosons B \u2032 to leptons. The\nstability of the middle state \u03c71 is guaranteed by an unbroken Z2 symmetry, which also keeps the 0.1 GeV-scale\nB and B \u2032\u2032 gauge bosons stable, but these (as we will show\npresently) are cosmologically harmless and not subject to\naccelerator constraints.\n\nVI.\n\nCOSMOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS\n\nIt is interesting to note that the model we have put\nforward based primarily on the INTEGRAL and ATIC\nobservations happens to predict a relic density for the\nDM which is not so far from the required value. To match\nthe WMAP value \u03a9\u03c7 h2 \u223c\n= 0.1, one needs h\u03c3ann vrel i \u223c\n=1\npb*c [30]; for three colors of nearly degenerate DM, this\nbecomes 3 pb*c. Take vrel = 2p1 /M , where p1 is the\nmomentum of one of the incoming \u03c7i 's in the center of\nmass \u221a\nframe. At the freeze-out temperature T \u223c M/20,\np1 \u223c 3T M. The Mandelstam variable t ranges between\nthe values t\u00b1 \u223c\n= \u2212M 2 \u00b1 2M p1 \u2261 \u2212M 2 \u00b1 \u2206t/2, while\n2\n\u223c\ns = 4M . A somewhat detailed computation gives us\nan estimate for the matrix element for the annihilation\nprocess shown in fig. 8(a) as |M|2 \u223c\n= 9g 4 (however we\nhave not been careful enough to determine whether the\nthree diagrams interfere constructively or destructively-\nthis estimate assumes the former). Then\n2\n\n\u03c7i\n\ng2\n\n\u03c7j\n(b)\n\nFIG. 8: Left (a): diagrams determining the relic density of\nthe DM particles \u03c7i . Not shown is the u-channel version of\nthe first diagram.

As we mentioned before, the numerical scattering computation becomes prohibitively slow\nat these larger values of \u03b1; work is in progress to explore\nthis region of parameter space.\nHowever, it is possible to add extra interactions to the\nmodel to adjust the relic density without the need for\nchanging our preferred value of the gauge coupling or\nDM mass. If there is an extra Z \u2032 gauge boson with the\ncouplings g\u03c7 \u03c7\u0304a Z\u03bc\u2032 \u03b3 \u03bc \u03b35 \u03c7a to the DM and ge \u0113R Z\u03bc\u2032 \u03b3 \u03bc eR\nto right-handed electrons, it can provide extra annihilation channels which easily bring h\u03c3ann vrel i up to the\nrequired value; we just need g\u03c7 ge /MZ2 \u2032 \u223c\n= 10g 2 /M 2 . If\n\u2032\nthe Z for some reason couples mainly to eR and not\nother SM particles, this can maintain the preference for\nannihilation into e+ e\u2212 but not heavier charged particles,\nas indicated by PAMELA/ATIC. Such a Z \u2032 would have\nto correspond to a U(1) symmetry broken at the scale M\nsince the \u03c7i masses do not conserve the current to which\nZ \u2032 couples. If such a Z \u2032 solves the relic density problem,\nthen its contribution to annihilation in the galaxy will\nalso dominate the PAMELA/ATIC signals, giving nearly\nmonoenergetic e+ e\u2212 via the process of fig. 9.\n\ne\u2212\n\ne+\n\n\u03c70\n\ne\u2212\n\ne+\n\nZ \u03bc\u2032\n\n(17)\n\nFor the values we have favored thus far, \u03b1 = 1.7 \u00d7 10\u22123\nand M = 500 Gev, (17) comes out too small by a factor\nof \u223c 100. We should thus hope to find an example of\nsufficient positron production for INTEGRAL at a value\nof \u03b1 approximately 10 times higher, \u03b1 \u223c\n= 0.02.

The\nestimate for h\u03c3ann vrel i is similar to to eq. (17), except\nthat the relevant mass scale is \u03bc rather than M . This\nmakes the cross section larger by a factor of 107 . Since\n\u03a9 scales like 1/\u03c3, the cosmological energy density of the\nstable B's is negligible, \u03a9B \u223c 10\u22126 . They can annihilate\ninto e+ e\u2212 because of their coupling to B \u2032 , but this would\nprobably be very difficult to detect due to the low density\nof the B's. The stable gauge bosons thus seem to be\nrather innocuous cosmological relics.\nNote added. After completing the first version of this\nwork, M. Pospelov pointed out a potentially serious difficulty: the process \u03c71 \u03c71 \u2192 \u03c70 \u03c70 can also proceed through\nSommerfeld-enhanced scatterings in the early universe,\nexponentially depleting the density of \u03c71 states which\nwe assumed to be as numerous as the \u03c70 's. This would\ntake place well below the initial freeze-out temperature,\nwhen the kinetic energy of the \u03c7's becomes comparable\nto the\np mass splitting \u223c 2me , and their velocity is of order 2me /M1 \u223c 10\u22123 , close to the value in the galaxy\ntoday.\nTo estimate the severity of the problem, we compute\nthe rate of \u03c71 \u03c71 \u2192 \u03c70 \u03c70 scatterings over the Hubble\nrate as a function of temperature. We take the value of\nthe cross section required for matching the INTEGRAL\nobservation, h\u03c3vi \u223c\n= 10\u221228 (M1 /TeV)2 (v0 /v) cm2 (where\nv0 is the typical velocity in the galaxy), and the density\nn = \u03bdT 2 with \u03bd = 10\u221212 \u00d7 (500 GeV/M1 ) corresponding\nto the value \u03a9DM \u223c\n= 0.1. The DM fell out of equilibrium\nat T \u223c\nM/20 \u223c\nGeV; at this time its momentum\n=\u221a\n= 25 p\nwas p \u223c 3M T = M 3/20, and thereafter it\u221a\nredshifted\n\u223c\nlike T . We can write p = cp T , where cp = 60 if the\nDM underwent standard freeze-out. However we will be\ninterested in more general, nonthermal ways of generating the DM, so we keep cp unspecified for now. Taking\n\u221a\nH\u223c\n= g\u2217 T 2 /Mp , we find\n\u03bdM1 Mp\n2 \u00d7 105\nnh\u03c3vi\n= 4 \u00d7 10\u22125 \u221a\n= \u221a\n2\nH\ng \u2217 cp\ng\u2217 cp GeV\n\n(18)\n\nThis is independent of T except through the number of\nspecies g\u2217 . From (18) it is clear that the \u03c71 -depleting\nprocess will \u221a\nbe in equilibrium in the standard scenario,\n> 105 to avoid the deplewhere cp \u223c\n= 60. We need cp \u223c\ntion of \u03c71 . This could happen if the \u03c7's were produced\nnonthermally. A straightforward way would be through\nthe late decays of a heavy scalar S \u2192 \u03c7i \u03c7i . For exam> 2M and the decay occurs at T < 5 MeV,\nple if mS \u223c\n1\n\u223c\nthen p \u223c M1 and cp \u223c\n= M1 /T \u223c 105 . This nonstandard\nproduction mechanism requires that the standard one be\nsubdominant, i.e., we need larger values of \u03b1 or of the Z \u2032\ncouplings (as discussed above) to suppress the relic density at freeze-out of the perturbative annihilations. It is\nstraightforward to verify that the \u03c7's will not reestablish\nkinetic equilibrium with the SM particles after this point.\nBy design, the strongest interaction with the SM is the\n\nscattering \u03c7i e\u00b1 \u2192 \u03c7i e\u00b1 via t-channel exchange of the Z \u2032\nboson. The rate for this is 8 orders of magnitude smaller\nthan the Hubble rate at T \u223c 5 MeV.\nOne question which arises with respect to out-ofequilibrium production of DM through decays is how to\nget a sufficiently small coupling between S and \u03c7 so that\nthe decay happens at such low temperatures. However,\nthis can be naturally explained in the context of a Grand\nUnified Theory (GUT), with a heavy gauge boson X that\ncouples to S and to \u03c7. Integrating out the X boson gives\n2\nrise to an interaction of the form gX\n|S|2 \u03c7\u0304a \u03c7a /MX , where\ngX is the GUT gauge coupling. This interaction does not\nallow for S to decay, but if we suppose that S gets a VEV\nat the TeV scale, a coupling which leads to decays is gen2\nerated, \u03bb = gX\nhSi/MX . The decay rate \u0393 \u223c\n= 3\u03bb2 MS /16\u03c0\n2\n< 5\n\u223c\nmust equal the Hubble rate H = g\u2217 T /Mp at T \u223c\n\u221212\n<\nMeV, leading to \u03bb \u223c 10\nfor MS \u223c 1 TeV. Taking\n2\nhSi \u223c 10 TeV, we find MX /gX\n\u223c 1016 GeV, the GUT\nscale. Of course S would need to have stronger couplings\nto other particles to freeze out at the right density.\n\nVII.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have demonstrated a modification of the original\nXDM scenario which makes the effect strong enough\nto explain the 511 keV anomaly, without any radical\nchange in our understanding of the DM distribution in\nthe galaxy, and within a theoretically sound class of particle physics models. The key idea is to have two nearly\ndegenerate states of stable DM, such that the heavier one\nmust first be excited by the small energy \u03b4M \u223c 100 keV\ninto a third state, in order to decay to the lowest state\n(fig. 1). Moreover, we need at least two kinds of new 0.1\nGeV-scale gauge bosons, B\u03bc and B\u03bc\u2032 (with a theoretical\npreference for a third, B\u03bc\u2032\u2032 ), such that B\u03bc and B\u03bc\u2032\u2032 mediate\nthe excitation \u03c71 \u03c71 \u2192 \u03c72 \u03c72 , while B\u03bc\u2032 is responsible for\nthe decay \u03c72 \u2192 \u03c70 e+ e\u2212 . A novelty of this scenario is\nthat the first excited DM state is stable, in addition to\nthe ground state.\nAlthough our primary interest was to address the INTEGRAL observation, we have also been motivated by\nthe suggestion [1] of a class of models which can simultaneously explain the other anomalies; thus we have focused on parameters where M1 is at least 500 GeV. Since\nthe INTEGRAL signal scales like M1\u22124 , we can more easily accommodate it by relaxing this requirement. To\nmake contact with ATIC/PPB-BETS, it may be desirable to find a model in which M1 is somewhat higher\nthan the 500 GeV value we were able to obtain thus far,\nsince the ATIC data indicate an excess going up to 800\nGeV. The fact that we did not yet find an example with\nM1 > 500 GeV may just be due to the numerical challenges of our method, where the integration time to solve\neq. (3) (subject to the appropriate boundary conditions)\nbecomes increasingly long as \u0393 (eq. (6)) and M1 are increased. It would be desirable to find an approximate\nanalytic solution in the large \u0393 regime to make further\n\n\f9\nprogress.\nOur proposal for modifying the excited dark matter\nspectrum has also motivated us to construct a model\nwhich is simpler than others that have been suggested\nalong these lines [29]; for example the new gauge group\nin the dark sector is SU(2) rather than SU(2)\u00d7U(1). A\nbonus of our model is the possibility of a new signal due\nto annihilation of DM states into a single e+ e\u2212 pair instead of two pairs, giving a sharper feature in the lepton\nspectrum at energies near the DM mass. In this paper\nwe have not tried to predict the PAMELA/ATIC/PPBBETS signals in as much detail as we have treated that\nof INTEGRAL; doing so would clearly be a worthwhile\n\n[1] N. Arkani-Hamed, D.
