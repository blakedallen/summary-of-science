Introduction\nIt is known that every smooth structure on a simply connected closed smooth 4manifold is obtained from the given manifold by a cork twist (Matveyev [20], CurtisFreedman-Hsiang-Stong [13], Akbulut-Matveyev [6]). It is thus important to investigate cork structures of 4-manifolds. The first author [1], [3], Bi\u017eaca-Gompf [12],\nand the authors [8] have found cork structures of (surgered) elliptic surfaces. However, finding cork structures of given exotic pairs of smooth 4-manifolds is usually\na quite difficulut task.\nIn [9] (and also [8]), rather than trying to locate corks in exotic manifold pairs\nwe constructed exotic manifold pairs from given corks. Our strategy in [9] was:\n(1) Construct a \"suitable\" 4-manifold with boundary which contains candidates of\ncorks; (2) Embed it into a closed 4-manifold with the non-vanishing Seiberg-Witten\ninvariant, \"appropriately\"; (3) Do surgeries and compute Seiberg-Witten invariants;\n(4) Relate surgeries and cork twists. Nevertheless, the step (2) is generally not easy.\nEliashberg [14] proved that compact Stein 4-manifolds can be recognized by\nhandlebody pictures, that is, just by checking Thurston-Bennequin framings of its\n2-handles (e.g. Gompf-Stipsicz [18], Ozbagci-Stipsicz [21]). Furthermore, compact\nStein 4-manifolds satisfy the following useful embedding theorem (though \"simply\nconnected\" is not claimed in [19] and [7], this is obvious from the proof in [7]):\nTheorem 1.1 (Lisca-Mati\u0107 [19], Akbulut-Ozbagci [7]). Every compact Stein 4manifold with boundary can be embedded into a simply connected, minimal, closed,\nDate: November 8, 2010. Revised: September 6, 2012.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification.

Here minimal means that there are no smoothly\nembedded 2-sphere with the self-intersection number \u22121.\nIn this paper, by using this embedding theorem, we give simple constructions\nof the various cork structures found in [9]. Moreover, we prove some of these\nstructurs for any cork of Mazur type, unlike the previous construction. We also\nconstruct a new example in the non-compact case. Our new strategy is as follows\n(the non-closed case is different): (1) Construct a \"suitable\" compact Stein 4manifold which contains candidates of corks (possibly after blow ups); (2) Embed\nit into a minimal closed symplectic 4-manifold; (3) Do surgeries (possibly after blow\nups) and compute Seiberg-Witten invariants; (4) Relate surgeries and cork twists.\nNow, by this approach, the previously difficult step (2) is automatically achieved.\nHowever, in this case, we need a care on computations of Seiberg-Witten invariants,\nsince we do not know the basic classes of the closed symplectic 4-manifold.\nIt is a natural question whether every smooth structure on a 4-manifold can be\ninduced from a fixed cork (C, \u03c4 ). The following theorem (see Section 3) shows that\ninfinitely many different smooth structures on a closed 4-manifold can be obtained\nfrom a fixed cork. Though such an example was given in [9] for specific corks,\nthe new method works for any cork of Mazur type. Similarly to [9], we also use\nFintushel-Stern's knot surgery for the construction.\nTheorem 1.2. Let (C, \u03c4 ) be any cork of Mazur type. Then there exist infinitely\nmany simply connected closed smooth 4-manifolds Xn (n \u2265 0) with the following\nproperties:\n(1) Xn (n \u2265 0) are mutually homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic;\n(2) For each n \u2265 1, Xn is obtained from X0 by a cork twist along (C, \u03c4 ).\nConsequently, the pair (C, \u03c4 ) is a cork of X0 .\nIn particular, from X0 we can produce infinitely many different smooth structures\nby the cork twist along (C, \u03c4 ). Consequently, these embeddings of C into X0 are\nmutually non-isotopic (knotted copies of each other).\nThe next theorem (see Section 6) says that we can put finitely many corks into\nmutually disjoint positions in closed 4-manifolds so that corresponding cork twists\nproduce mutually different exotic smooth structures on the 4-manifolds. We prove\nthis by using Fintushel-Stern's rational blowdown.\nTheorem 1.3 ([9]). For each n \u2265 1, there exist simply connected closed smooth\n4-manifolds Xi (0 \u2264 i \u2264 n) and corks (Ci , \u03c4i ) (0 \u2264 i \u2264 n) of X0 with the following\nproperties:\n(1) The submanifolds Ci (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n) of X0 are mutually disjoint;\n(2) Xi (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n) is obtained from X0 by the cork twist along (Ci , \u03c4i );\n(3) Xi (0 \u2264 i \u2264 n) are mutually homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic.\nThis theorem easily gives the following corollary which says that, for an embedding of a cork into a closed 4-manifold, cork twists can produce finitely many\ndifferent exotic smooth structures on the 4-manifold by only changing the involution\nof the cork without changing its embedding:\nCorollary 1.4 ([9]). For each n \u2265 1, there exist simply connected closed smooth 4manifolds Xi (0 \u2264 i \u2264 n), an embedding of a compact contractible Stein 4-manifold\n\n\fSTEIN 4-MANIFOLDS AND CORKS\n\n3\n\nC into X0 , and involutions \u03c4i (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n) on the boundary \u2202C with the following\nproperties:\n(1) For each 1 \u2264 i \u2264 n, Xi is obtained from X0 by the cork twist along (C, \u03c4i )\nwhere the above embedding of C is fixed;\n(2) Xi (0 \u2264 i \u2264 n) are mutually homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic, hence\nthe pairs (C, \u03c4i ) (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n) are mutually different corks of X0 .\nIn [8], we introduced new objects which we called plugs. We can also give simple\nconstructions of various examples for plug structures.\nIn this paper we also give a new example of cork structures in the non-compact\ncase by using the above embedding theorem. The theorem below (see Section 7)\nshows that we can embed a fixed cork into infinitely many mutually disjoint positions in a non-compact 4-manifold so that corresponding cork twists produce\ninfinitely many mutually different exotic smooth structures on the 4-manifold:\nTheorem 1.5. Let (C, \u03c4 ) be any cork of Mazur type. Then there exist infinitely\nmany simply connected non-compact smooth 4-manifolds Xn (n \u2265 0) and infinitely\nmany embedded copies Cn (n \u2265 1) of C into X0 with the following properties:\n(1) Cn (n \u2265 0) are mutually disjoint in X0 ;\n(2) Xn (n \u2265 1) is obtained from X0 by the cork twist along (Cn , \u03c4 );\n(3) Xn (n \u2265 0) are mutually homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic.\nConsequently, these infinitely many disjoint embeddings of C into X0 are mutually non-isotopic (knotted copies of each other).\nThe proof of this theorem immediately give the following corollary which says\nthat the smallest 4-manifold S 4 has arbitrary many compact submanifolds which\nare mutually homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic. Furthermore they are obtained\nby a disjointly embedded fixed cork.\nCorollary 1.6. Let (C, \u03c4 ) be any cork of Mazur type. Then, for each n \u2265 1, there\n(n)\nexist simply connected compact smooth 4-manifolds Xi (0 \u2264 i \u2264 n) and embedded\ncopies Ci (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n) of C into X0 with the following properties:\n(1)\n(2)\n(3)\n(4)\n\nCi (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n) are mutually disjoint in X0 ;\n(n)\nXi (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n) is obtained from X0 by the cork twist along (Ci , \u03c4 );\n(n)\nXi (0 \u2264 i \u2264 n) can be embedded into S 4 ;\n(n)\nXi (0 \u2264 i \u2264 n) are mutually homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic.\n\nAfter the first draft of this paper, a more systematic construction of exotic (Stein)\n4-manifolds was given in our paper [10].\nAcknowledgements. The second author would like to thank Kenji Fukaya and\nYuichi Yamada for useful comments.\n2. Corks\nIn this section, we recall corks. For details, see [8].\nDefinition 2.1. Let C be a compact contractible Stein 4-manifold with boundary\nand \u03c4 : \u2202C \u2192 \u2202C an involution on the boundary. We call (C, \u03c4 ) a Cork if \u03c4 extends\nto a self-homeomorphism of C, but cannot extend to any self-diffeomorphism of C.\n\n\f4\n\nAKBULUT AND YASUI\n\nFor a cork (C, \u03c4 ) and a smooth 4-manifold X which contains C, a cork twist of X\nalong (C, \u03c4 ) is defined to be the smooth 4-manifold obtained from X by removing\nthe submanifold C and regluing it via the involution \u03c4 . Note that, a cork twist does\nnot change the homeomorphism type of X (see the remark below). A cork (C, \u03c4 )\nis called a cork of X if the cork twist of X along (C, \u03c4 ) is not diffeomorphic to X.\nRemark 2.2. In this paper, we always assume that corks are contractible. (We\ndid not assume this in the more general definition of [8].) Note that Freedman's\ntheorem tells us that every self-diffeomorphism of the boundary of C extends to a\nself-homeomorphism of C when C is a compact contractible smooth 4-manifold.\nDefinition 2.3. Let Wn be the contractible smooth 4-manifold shown in Figure 1.\nLet fn : \u2202Wn \u2192 \u2202Wn be the obvious involution obtained by first surgering S 1 \u00d7 D3\nto D2 \u00d7 S 2 in the interior of Wn , then surgering the other embedded D2 \u00d7 S 2 back\nto S 1 \u00d7 D3 (i.e. replacing the dot and \"0\" in Figure 1). Note that the diagram of\nWn comes from a symmetric link.\n\nFigure 1. Wn\nIn [8] a quick proof of the following theorem was given, by using the embedding\ntheorem of Stein 4-manifolds.\nTheorem 2.4 ([8, Theorem 2.5]). For n \u2265 1, the pair (Wn , fn ) is a cork.\nAfter the first draft of this paper, the following type corks are introduced in [4].\nDefinition 2.5 ([4]). Let C be a 4-dimensional oriented handlebody whose handlebody diagram consists of a dotted unknot K1 and a 0-framed unknot K2 . Let\nL be the link in S 3 which consists of K1 and K2 . Suppose that C satisfies the\nfollowing conditions.\n(1) The link L is symmetric. Namely, there exists a smooth isotopy of S 3 which\nexchanges the components K1 and K2 of L.\n(2) The linking number of K1 and K2 is \u00b11.\n(3) After converting the 1-handle notation of C to the ball notation, C becomes\na Stein handlebody (i.e. the maximal Thurston-Bennequin number of K2\nwith respect to the unique Stein fillable contact structure on S 1 \u00d7 S 2 =\n\u2202(S 1 \u00d7 D3 ) is at least +1.)\nLet C \u2032 be the 4-manifold obtained by first surgering S 1 \u00d7 D3 to D2 \u00d7 S 2 inside\nC, then surgering the other embedded D2 \u00d7 S 2 back to S 1 \u00d7 D3 (i.e. exchanging\nthe dot and 0 in the handle picture of C). Since these surgeries were done in the\ninterior of C, this operation gives a natural diffeomorphism \u03c6 : \u2202C \u2192 \u2202C \u2032 . On\nthe other hand, the condition (1) gives a diffeomorphism \u03c8 : C \u2192 C \u2032 . Now let\n\u03c4 : \u2202C \u2192 \u2202C be the involution defined by \u03c4 = (\u03c8|\u2202C )\u22121 \u25e6 \u03c6 (\u03c4 2 corresponds to the\n\n\fSTEIN 4-MANIFOLDS AND CORKS\n\n5\n\noperation exchanging the dot and 0 twice). The condition (2) guarantees that C is\ncontractible. In this paper, we call such a pair (C, \u03c4 ) a cork of Mazur type.\nNote that any cork of Mazur type indeed corks in the sense of Definition 2.1.\nThis can be easily seen by applying the method of [5] (cf. [8]). The above (Wn , fn )\n(n \u2265 1) is clearly a cork of Mazur type. Note that D4 cannot be a cork. The lemma\nbelow is sometimes useful.\nLemma 2.6. Let (C, \u03c4 ) be a cork of Mazur type. Then its double DC and the cork\ntwist of DC along (C, \u03c4 ) are diffeomorphic to S 4 .\nProof. Consider natural handlebodies of these 4-manifolds. Since the unique dotted\ncircle of the cork twist of DC has a 0-framed meridian, the latter claim is easily\nfollows. Here note that the attaching circle K2 of the unique 2-handle of C is\nhomotopic to the meridian of the dotted circle K1 in the boundary \u2202(S 1 \u00d7 D3 ) of\nthe sub 1-handlebody of C. This homotopy can be seen as changes of self-crossings\nof the attaching circle in the handlebody picture. Since K2 has a 0-framed meridian\nin the handlebody picture of DC, these crossing changes can be realized as handle\nslides. We can thus easily see that DC is diffeomorphic to S 4 .\n\u0003\n3. Infinitely many knotted corks\nHere we prove Theorem 1.2 by using the embedding theorem of Stein 4-manifolds\ntogether with Fintushel-Stern knot surgery. For simplicity, we give a proof for the\n(W1 , f1 ) cork. The same argument holds for any cork of Mazur type.\nDefinition 3.1. Let S be the compact 4-manifold with boundary in Figure 2. Note\nthat S disjointly contains a cusp neighborhood and W1 .\n\nFigure 2. S\nThe embedding theorem of Stein 4-manifold gives the minimal symplectic closed\n4-manifold below:\nProposition 3.2. There exists a simply connected, minimal, closed, symplectic\n4-manifold Se with the following properties:\ne > 1;\n(1) b+ (S)\n2\n\n(2) Se contains the 4-manifold S;\n(3) A naturally embedded torus in the cusp neighborhood of S represents a none\nzero second homology class of S.\n\nProof. Change the diagram of S into the Legendrian diagram in Figure 3 (in particular change the notation of the 1-handle from the dotted unknot to pair of balls).\nHere the coefficients of the 2-handles denote the contact framings. Then attach\n\n\f6\n\nAKBULUT AND YASUI\n\na 2-handle to S along the dotted meridian in Figure 3 with contact \u22121 framing.\nSince each framing is contact \u22121 framing, this new handlebody is also a compact\nStein 4-manifold. Hence Theorem 1.1 gives us a simply connected, minimal, closed,\ne\nsymplectic 4-manifold Se with b+\n2 (S) > 1 which contains this handlebody. The\n4-manifold Se has the property (3), because the torus in the cusp neighborhood\nalgebraically intersects a sphere with the self-intersection number \u22122.\n\u0003\n\nFigure 3. Legendrian diagram of S with contact framings\n\nThough the rest of argument in this section is almost the same as [9], we proceed\nthe proof for the completeness.\nDefinition 3.3.\n(1) Let X be the cork twist of Se along (W1 , f1 ), where this copy of W1 is the\none contained in S. Note that X contains a cusp neighborhood because the\ncopy of W1 in S is disjoint from the cusp neighborhood of S.\n(2) Let K be a knot in S 3 , and XK denote the manifold obtained by the\n(Fintushel-Stern's) knot surgery operation with K in the cusp neighborhood\nof X ([16]) .\ne\n(3) Let SeK be the knot surgered Se with K in the cusp neighborhood of S.\nThe corollary below clearly follows from Proposition 3.2, Definition 3.3 and the\ndiagram of S in Figure 2. See also Figure 4.\nCorollary 3.4.\n(1) The copy of W1 in X (given in Definition 3.3.) is disjoint from the cusp\nneighborhood of X.\n(2) X splits off S 2 \u00d7 S 2 as a connected summand. Consequently, the SeibergWitten invariant of X vanishes. Furthermore, the cusp neighborhood of X\nis disjoint from S 2 \u00d7 S 2 , in this connected sum decomposition of X.\n(3) SeK is obtained from XK by a cork twist along (W1 , f1 ). In particular, XK\nis homeomorphic to SeK .\n\n\fSTEIN 4-MANIFOLDS AND CORKS\n\n7\n\nCorollary 3.5.\n(1) XK is diffeomorphic to X. In particular, the Seiberg-Witten invariant of\nXK vanishes.\n(2) For each knot K in S 3 , SeK is obtained from X by a cork twist along\n(W1 , f1 ).\n(3) If K in S 3 has non-trivial Alexander polynomial, then SeK is homeomorphic\nbut not diffeomorphic to X, in particular (W1 , f1 ) is a cork of X.\nProof. The claim (1) follows from Corollary 3.4.(2), the definition of XK and the\nstabilization theorem of knot surgery by the first author [2] and Auckly [11]. Corollary 3.4.(3) thus shows the claim (2). Since the Seiberg-Witten invariants of SeK\ndoes not vanish (Fintushel-Stern [16]), the claim (3) follows from the claim (1). \u0003\n\ne X, SeK and XK\nFigure 4. relation between S,\nNow we can easily prove Theorem 1.2.\nProof of Theorem 1.2. Let X0 := X, and Kn (n \u2265 1) be knots in S 3 with mutually\ndifferent non-trivial Alexander polynomials. Define Xn = SeKn . Then the claim\neasily follows from Corollary 3.5 and the Fintushel-Stern's formula ([16]) of the\nSeiberg-Witten invariant of knot surgered manifolds. This gives a proof for the\n(W1 , f1 ) cork. Clearly the same argument holds for any cork of Mazur type.\n\u0003\n4. Rational blowdown\nIn this section we review the rational blowdown introduced by Fintushel-Stern\n[15], and recall relations between rational blowdowns and corks.\nLet Cp and Bp be the smooth 4-manifolds defined by handlebody diagrams in\nFigure 5, and u1 , . . . , up\u22121 elements of H2 (Cp ; Z) given by corresponding 2-handles\nin the figure such that ui * ui+1 = +1 (1 \u2264 i \u2264 p \u2212 2). The boundary \u2202Cp of Cp is\ndiffeomorphic to the lens space L(p2 , p \u2212 1), and also diffeomorphic to the boundary\n\u2202Bp of Bp .\nSuppose that Cp embeds in a smooth 4-manifold Z. Let Z(p) be the smooth\n4-manifold obtained from Z by removing Cp and gluing Bp along the boundary.\n\n\f8\n\nAKBULUT AND YASUI\n\nFigure 5.\nThe smooth 4-manifold Z(p) is called the rational blowdown of Z along Cp . Note\nthat Z(p) is uniquely determined up to diffeomorphism by a fixed pair (Z, Cp ) (see\n\u2212\nFintushel-Stern [15]). This operation preserves b+\n2 , decreases b2 , may create torsion\nin the first homology group.\nRational blowdowns have the following relations with corks.\nTheorem 4.1 ([9], see also [8]). Let Dp be the smooth 4-manifold in Figure 6 (notice\nthat Dp is Cp with two 2-handles attached). Suppose that a smooth 4-manifold Z\ncontains Dp . Let Z(p) be the rational blowdown of Z along the copy of Cp contained\nin Dp . Then the submanifold Dp of Z contains Wp\u22121 such that Z(p) #(p \u2212 1)CP2\nis obtained from Z by the cork twist along (Wp\u22121 , fp\u22121 ).\n\nFigure 6. Dp\n5. Seiberg-Witten invariants\nIn this section, we briefly review basic facts about the Seiberg-Witten invariants. For more details, see, for example, Fintushel-Stern [17], Gompf-Stipsicz [18],\nOzbagci-Stipsicz [21].\nSuppose that Z is a simply connected closed smooth 4-manifold with b+\n2 (Z) > 1\nand odd. Let C(Z) be the set of characteristic elements of H 2 (Z; Z). Then the\nSeiberg-Witten invariant SWZ : C(Z) \u2192 Z is defined. Let e(Z) and \u03c3(Z) be\nthe Euler characteristic and the signature of Z, respectively, and dZ (K) the even\ninteger defined by dZ (K) = 14 (K 2 \u2212 2e(Z) \u2212 3\u03c3(Z)) for K \u2208 C(Z). If SWZ (K) 6= 0,\nthen K is called a Seiberg-Witten basic class of Z. It is known that if K is a\nSeiberg-Witten basic class of Z, then \u2212K is also a Seiberg-Witten basic class of Z.\nWe denote \u03b2(Z) as the set of the Seiberg-Witten basic classes of Z. The blow up\nformula is as follows:\nTheorem 5.1 (Witten [24], cf. Gompf-Stipsicz [18]). Suppose that Z is a simply\nconnected closed smooth 4-manifold with b+\n2 (Z) > 1. If \u03b2(Z) is not empty, then\n\u03b2(Z#nCP2 ) = {K \u00b1 E1 \u00b1 E2 \u00b1 * * * \u00b1 En | K \u2208 \u03b2(Z)}.\n\n\fSTEIN 4-MANIFOLDS AND CORKS\n\n9\n\nHere E1 , E2 , . . . , En denotes the standard orthogonal basis of H 2 (nCP2 ; Z) such\nthat Ei2 = \u22121 (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n).\nIf every Seiberg-Witten basic class K of Z satisfies dZ (K) = 0, then the 4manifold Z is called of simple type. For example, it is known that every closed\nsymplectic 4-manifold with b+\n2 > 1 has non-vanishing Seiberg-Witten invariant and\nis of simple type. For such a 4-manifold, the following adjunction inequality holds:\nTheorem 5.2 (Ozsv\u00e1th-Szab\u00f3 [22], cf. Ozbagci-Stipsicz [21]). Suppose that Z is a\nsimply connected closed smooth 4-manifold of simple type with b+\n2 (Z) > 1, and that\n\u03a3 \u2282 Z is a smoothly embedded, oriented, connected closed surface of genus g > 0.\nLet [\u03a3] be the second homology class of Z represented by the embedded surface\n\u03a3. Then, for every Seiberg-Witten basic class K of X, the following adjunction\ninequality holds:\n[\u03a3]2 + |hK, [\u03a3]i| \u2264 2g \u2212 2.\n5.1. Seiberg-Witten invariants of rational blowdowns. We here recall the\nchange of the Seiberg-Witten invariants by rationally blowing down. Let Z be a\nsimply connected closed smooth 4-manifold with b+\n2 (Z) > 1 and odd. Suppose that\nZ contains a copy of Cp . Let Z(p) be the rational blowdown of Z along the copy\nof Cp . Assume that Z(p) is simply connected. The following theorems are obtained\nby Fintushel-Stern [15].\nTheorem 5.3 (Fintushel-Stern [15]). For every element K of C(Z(p) ), there exists\nan element K\u0303 of C(Z) such that K|Z(p) \u2212Bp = K\u0303|Z\u2212Cp and dZ(p) (K) = dZ (K\u0303). Such\nan element K\u0303 of C(Z) is called a lift of K.\nTheorem 5.4 (Fintushel-Stern [15]). If an element K\u0303 of C(Z) is a lift of some\nelement K of C(Z(p) ), then SWZ(p) (K) = SWZ (K\u0303).\nTheorem 5.5 (Fintushel-Stern [15], cf. Park [23]). If an element K\u0303 of C(Z) satisfies that (K\u0303|Cp )2 = 1 \u2212 p and K\u0303|\u2202Cp = mp \u2208 Zp2 \u223c\n= H 2 (\u2202Cp ; Z) with m \u2261 p \u2212 1\n(mod 2), then there exists an element K of C(Z(p) ) such that K\u0303 is a lift of K.\nCorollary 5.6. If an element K\u0303 of C(Z) satisfies K\u0303(u1 ) = K\u0303(u2 ) = * * * =\nK\u0303(up\u22122 ) = 0 and K\u0303(up\u22121 ) = \u00b1p, then K\u0303 is a lift of some element K of C(Z(p) ).\n6. Disjointly embedded corks\nIn this section we prove Theorem 1.3 and Corollary 1.4 by using the embedding\ntheorem of Stein 4-manifolds together with Finushel-Stern's rational blowdown.\ne p (p \u2265 2) be the compact 4-manifold with boundary in FigDefinition 6.1. Let D\nure 7 (i.e. the blow down of Dp ). Note that the left most knot in the figure is a (p +\ne pn .\ne p2 , . . . , D\ne 1 , p2 , . . . , pn ) as the boundary sum of D\ne p1 , D\n1, p) torus knot. Define D(p\nWe denote by D(p1 , p2 , . . . , pn ) the boundary sum of Dp1 , Dp2 , . . . , Dpn .\nProposition 6.2. For each n \u2265 1 and each p1 , p2 , . . . , pn \u2265 2, there exists a\nsimply connected, minimal, closed, symplectic 4-manifold S(p1 , p2 , . . . , pn ) with the\nfollowing properties:\n(1) b+\n2 (S(p1 , p2 , . . . , pn )) > 1;\ne 1 , p2 , . . . , pn );\n(2) The 4-manifold S(p1 , p2 , . . . , pn ) contains D(p\n\n\f10\n\nAKBULUT AND YASUI\n\nep\nFigure 7.

(1) and (2). Change the diagram of D(p\ndiagram as in Figure 8. Then, for each unknot, attach a 2-handle along a contact \u22121-framed trefoil knot, as in Figure 9. Since every 2-handle has contact \u22121framings, this new handlebody is a compact Stein 4-manifold. The embedding\ntheorem of Stein 4-manifolds thus gives a simply connected, minimal, closed, symplectic 4-manifold S(p1 , p2 , . . . , pn ) with b+\n2 (S(p1 , p2 , . . . , pn )) > 1 which contains\nthis handlebody. The claims (1) and (2) hence follows.\n(3). Let u (resp. v) be the element of H2 (S(p1 , p2 , . . . , pn ); Z) given by a contact\n\u22121-framed unknot (resp. a contact \u22121-framed trefoil knot), as in Figure 9. We can\neasily check, by a handle slide, that u + v is represented by a torus with the selfintersection number 0. Let K be a Seiberg-Witten basic class of S(p1 , p2 , . . . , pn ).\nSince v and u + v are represented by tori with self-intersection numbers 0, the\nadjunction inequality gives hK, vi = 0 and hK, u + vi = 0. We thus have hK, ui = 0.\nLet wi be the element of H2 (S(p1 , p2 , . . . , pn ); Z) given by the contact \u22121-framed\ne pi . Note that wi is represented by a genus pi (pi \u22121)\n(pi + 1, pi ) torus knot of D\n2\nsurface with the self-intersection number p2i \u2212 pi \u2212 2. We can also easily check, by\nthe adjunction inequality, that hK, wi i = 0 (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n).

Then the proposition above together with the\nblow up formula immediately gives the following corollary.\n\n\fSTEIN 4-MANIFOLDS AND CORKS\n\n11\n\nFigure 9.\nCorollary 6.3.

In this subsection, we complete the proofs\nof Theorem 1.3 and Corollary 1.4 by computing the Seiberg-Witten invariants of\nthe 4-manifolds Xi (0 \u2264 i \u2264 n) in Definition 6.4.\nLemma 6.8. Fix an integer i \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , n}. If Seiberg-Witten basic classes K\nand K \u2032 of X0 satisfy K 6= K \u2032 , then restrictions K|X0 \u2212Cpi and K \u2032 |X0 \u2212Cpi are not\nequal to each other.\nProof.

Lemma 5.1\nof [25] also gives H1 (X0 \u2212 Cpi ; Z) = 0. Thus Mayer-Vietoris exact sequence for\nCpi \u222a (X0 \u2212 Cpi ) = X0 is as follows:\n0 \u2192 H2 (Cpi ; Z) \u2295 H2 (X0 \u2212 Cpi ; Z) \u2192 H2 (X0 ; Z) \u2192 Zp2i \u2192 0.\nThe case where K|Cpi = K \u2032 |Cpi : In this case, the exact sequence above together\nwith the universal coefficient theorem for X0 implies K|X0 \u2212Cpi 6= K \u2032 |X0 \u2212Cpi .\n(i)\n\n(i)\n\nThe case where K|Cpi 6= K \u2032 |Cpi : In this case, we have hK, upi \u22121 i 6= hK \u2032 , upi \u22121 i,\n(i)\n\n(i)\n\nbecause hK, uj i = hK \u2032 , uj i = 0 for 0 \u2264 j \u2264 pi \u2212 2. We thus get hK, \u2212pi ei i 6=\n6\nhK \u2032 , \u2212pi ei i. This fact immediately gives hK, \u03b1i =\n6 hK \u2032 , \u03b1i and hence K|X0 \u2212Cpi =\n\u2032\n\u0003\nK |X0 \u2212Cpi .\nThough the rest of the proof is the same as that of Theorem 1.3 and 1.4 in [9],\nwe proceed for the completeness. For a smooth 4-manifold Z we denote N (Z) as\nthe number of elements of \u03b2(Z).\nLemma 6.9. N (Xi ) = 2pi \u22121 N (X0 ) (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n)\nProof. Corollary 6.3, Theorem 5.1 and Corollary 5.6 guarantees that every SeibergWitten basic class of X0 is a lift of some element of C(Xi\u2032 ). Lemma 6.8 shows that\nthese basic classes of X0 have mutually different restrictions to X0 \u2212Cpi (= Xi\u2032 \u2212Bpi ).\nNote that every element of H 2 (Xi\u2032 ; Z) is uniquely determined by its restriction to\nXi\u2032 \u2212 Bpi . (We can easily check this by using the cohomology exact sequence for\nthe pair (Xi\u2032 , Xi\u2032 \u2212 Bpi ).) Hence Theorems 5.3 and 5.4 give N (Xi\u2032 ) = N (X0 ). Now\nthe required claim follows from the blow-up formula.\n\u0003\nCorollary 6.10. If p1 , p2 , . . . , pn \u2265 2 are mutually different, then Xi (0 \u2264 i \u2264 n)\nare mutually homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic.\nProof of Theorem 1.3 and Corollary 1.4. These clearly follow from the corollary\nabove and Proposition 6.6.\n\u0003\nRemark 6.11. If we appropriately choose p1 , p2 , . . . , pn , then we can show that\nthe natural combinations of cork twists of X0 produce 2n \u2212 1 distinct smooth\nstructures. In fact, similarly to Lemma 6.9, we can show that the number of SeibergWitten basic classes of the combinations of cork twists of X0 along (Wpi1 \u22121 , fpi1 \u22121 ),\n(Wpi2 \u22121 , fpi2 \u22121 ), * * * , (Wpik \u22121 , fpik \u22121 ) is 2pi1 +pi2 +***+pik \u2212k N (X0 ).\n7.

However, in\nthis section, we use the embedding theorem to detect smooth structures (i.e. to\nevaluate the minimal genera of surfaces which represent second homology classes).\nFor simplicity, we first give a proof for the (W1 , f1 ) cork.

(1) The lower 2-handle (call K) of Nn gives the generator \u03b1 after sliding over\nthe upper 2-handle n times. Thus all we have to check is to see that the knot K\nbounds a genus n surface in the interior of W1 after sliding n times. See Figure 14.\nIntroduce a 1-handle/2-handle pair and slide the upper 0-framed unknot twice,\nthen we get the second picture. An isotopy gives the third picture. We slide the\nknot K over the 0-framed unknot n-times so that K does not link with the lower\ndotted circle. We get the fourth picture by ignoring two 2-handles and isotopy. We\ncan now easily see that K bounds a genus n surface by the standard argument (cf.\nGompf-Stipsicz [18, Exercise.4.5.12.(b)]). (Check that K is the boundary of D2\nwith 2n bands attached.)\n(2) Attach a 2-handle to the boundary of Mn as in the first picture of Figure 15.\nThe second picture is given by sliding the upper left 2-handle over this new 2-handle\nn-times. Slide the middle 2-handle over its meridian as in the third diagram. Note\nthat the middle 2-handle now links with the 1-handle geometrically once. Cancelling\nthe 1-handle gives the last diagram. Attach two 3-handles cancelling these two 2handles. So get an embedding of Mn into D4 . The Nn case is similar, Figure 16. \u0003\n\n\fSTEIN 4-MANIFOLDS AND CORKS\n\n15\n\nFigure 14.\n\nFigure 15.\n\nFigure 16.\nBy using the embedding theorem of Stein 4-manifolds, we show the following.\n\n\f16\n\nAKBULUT AND YASUI\n\nLemma 7.3. Let \u03b1 be the generator of H2 (Nn ; Z) \u223c\n= Z. If k\u03b1 is represented by a\nsmoothly embedded surface with genus less than n, then k = 0.\nen be the compact smooth 4-manifold given in the left side of Figure 17.\nProof. Let N\nen with contact \u22121-framings. Thus N\nen\nThe right side is a Legendrian diagram of N\nis a compact Stein 4-manifold. Therefore there exists a simply connected minimal\nen .\nclosed symplectic 4-manifold Sn which contains N\nLet e1 , e2 , . . . , en\u22121 be the standard orthogonal basis of H2 ((n \u2212 1)CP2 ; Z) such\nthat e2i = \u22121 (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n \u2212 1). Blow up Sn as in Figure 18, where e1 , e2 , . . . , en\u22121\ndenote the second homology classes given by corresponding 2-handles. Note that\nthis picture contains Nn . The lower 0-framed unknot in this picture gives the\ngenerator \u03b1 of H2 (Nn ; Z) after sliding over the upper 0-framed unknot n times.\nWe thus get \u03b1 * e1 = n and \u03b1 * ei = 1 (2 \u2264 i \u2264 n \u2212 1), where we view \u03b1 as the\nelement of H2 (Sn #(n \u2212 1)CP2 ) through the natural inclusion.\nLet K be a Seiberg-Witten basic class of Sn . Then the blow up formula shows\nthat \u00b1K + e1 + e2 + * * * + en\u22121 is a Seiberg-Witten basic class of Sn #(n \u2212 1)CP2 .\nTherefore, there exists a Seiberg-Witten basic class L of Sn #(n \u2212 1)CP2 which\nsatisfies the inequality below:\n|hL, k\u03b1i| \u2265 |k(n + (n \u2212 2))| = |k|(2n \u2212 2).\n2\n\nSince (k\u03b1) = 0 and n \u2265 2, we can now easily check the required claim by applying\nthe adjunction inequality to Sn #(n \u2212 1)CP2 .\n\u0003\n\nen and its legendrian diagram with contact framings\nFigure 17.

(1) For each n \u2265 1, there exists a basis {\u03b1, \u03b21 , \u03b22 , . . . } of\nH2 (Xn ; Z) such that \u03b1 is represented by a smoothly embedded surface with genus\nn + 1, and that \u03b2i (i \u2265 1) is represented by a smoothly embedded sphere.\n(2) For any n \u2265 1, there exists no basis {\u03b1, \u03b21 , \u03b22 , . . . } of H2 (Xn ; Z) such that\n\u03b1 is represented by a surface with genus less than n + 1, and that \u03b2i (i \u2265 1) is\nrepresented by a smoothly embedded sphere.\nProof. (1) is obvious from Lemma 7.2.\n(2). Let ui (i \u2265 2, i 6= n + 1) and un+1 be the basis\nP\u221e of H2 (Mi ; Z) and\nH2 (Nn+1 ; Z), respectively. Suppose that an element v = i=2 ai ui of H2 (Xn ; Z)\nis represented by a surface with genus less than n + 1. Here ai = 0 except finite\nnumber of i. Lemma 7.2 shows that Xn is embedded into Nn+1 and that this embedding sends v to an+1 un+1 . Since an+1 un+1 \u2208 H2 (Nn+1 ; Z) is represented by a\nsurface with genus less than n + 1, Lemma 7.3 gives an+1 = 0. This fact implies\nthe required claim.\n\u0003\nProof of Theorem 1.5. We first discuss for the (W1 , f1 ) cork. The definition of Xn\nobviously shows (1), (2). The claim (3) follows from Proposition 7.4.\nNow consider a general cork (C, \u03c4 ) of Mazur type. We modify the above construction as follows. Let Nn be the 4-manifold obtained from C by attaching a\n2-handle similarly to Figure 12. Then define Mn as the cork twist of Nn along\n(C, \u03c4 ). Using these Mn and Nn , we can define Xn similarly to the original definition. The claims corresponding to Lemmas 7.2 and 7.3 clearly hold after suitable\nmodifications of values of various genera (Though we calculated the exact values of\ngenera in those claims, we do not need the exact values if we care about detecting\nsmooth structures of infinitely many of Xn 's. ). Namely we obtain the following\n(For the proof of Lemma 7.5.(2), see also Lemma 2.6.).\nLemma 7.5. (1) There exist an integer sequence gn (n \u2265 1) satisfying the following\ncondition. The generator \u03b1 of H2 (Nn ; Z) \u223c\n= Z is represented by a smoothly embedded\ngenus gn surface. We may assume that gn+1 > gn for each n \u2265 1, if necessary by\nconnect summing with null homologous surfaces.\n(2) For n \u2265 1, the 4-manifolds Mn and Nn can be embedded into the 4-ball D4 .\nLemma 7.6. Let \u03b1 be the generator of H2 (Nn ; Z) \u223c\n= Z. Then there exists a strictly\nincreasing integer sequence hn (n \u2265 1) satisfying the following condition. If k\u03b1 is\nrepresented by a smoothly embedded surface with genus less than hn , then k = 0.\nProposition 7.7. (1) For each n \u2265 1, there exists a basis {\u03b1, \u03b21 , \u03b22 , . . . } of\nH2 (Xn ; Z) such that \u03b1 is represented by a smoothly embedded surface with genus\ngn+1 , and that \u03b2i (i \u2265 1) is represented by a smoothly embedded sphere.\n(2) For any n \u2265 1, there exists no basis {\u03b1, \u03b21 , \u03b22 , . . . } of H2 (Xn ; Z) such that\n\u03b1 is represented by a surface with genus less than hn+1 , and that \u03b2i (i \u2265 1) is\nrepresented by a smoothly embedded sphere.\nSince gn and hn (n \u2265 1) are both strictly increasing integer sequence, Proposition 7.7 implies the existence of a strictly increasing integer sequence ni (i \u2265 1)\nsuch that Xni (i \u2265 1) are mutually non-diffeomorphic. The rest of the required\nclaims easily follows.\n\u0003\nRemark 7.8. Lemma 7.2.(2) shows that Xn (n \u2265 0) can be embedded into S 4 .\n\n\f18\n\nAKBULUT AND YASUI\n(n)\n\nDefinition 7.9. Let X0 (n \u2265 1) be the boundary sum of M2 , M3 , . . . , Mn+1 .\n(n)\n(n)\nDefine Xi (1 \u2264 i \u2264 n) as the cork twist of X0 along (W1 , f1 ) where this W1 is\nthe one contained in the Mi+1 component.\nProof of Corollary 1.6. This is almost the same as the proof of Theorem 1.5.\n\n\u0003\n\n8. Further remarks\nIn this section, we conclude this paper by making some remarks.\nIn [8], we introduced new objects which we call plugs. By using the embedding\ntheorem of Stein 4-manifolds, we can easily construct examples of plug structures\ncorresponding to Theorem 1.2, 1.3 and Corollary 1.4. The proofs are almost the\nsame as that of cork structures. See also [9].\nIn Section 7, we used the embedding theorem to detect smooth structures. This\ntechnique is useful for constructions of exotic smooth structures on compact 4manifolds with boundary. For details, see our paper [10] which was written after\nthe first draft of this paper.\nReferences\n[1] S. Akbulut, A fake compact contractible 4-manifold, J.
