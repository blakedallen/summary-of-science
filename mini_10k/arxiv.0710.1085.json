A continuum\nis any compact connected space. A nontrivial convergent sequence is a convergent\n\u03c9\u2013sequence of distinct points. As usual, dim(X) is the covering dimension of X;\nfor details, see Engelking [5]. \"HS\" abbreviates \"hereditarily separable\". We shall\nprove:\nTheorem 1.1 Assuming \u2666, there is a locally connected HS continuum Z such that\ndim(Z) = 1 and Z has no nontrivial convergent sequences.\nNote that points in Z must have uncountable character, so that Z is not hereditarily Lindel\u00f6f; thus, Z is an S-space.\nSpaces with some of these features are well-known from the literature. A compact\nF-space has no nontrivial convergent sequences. Such a space can be a continuum;\nfor example, the \u010cech remainder \u03b2[0, 1)\\[0, 1) is connected, although not locally connected; more generally, no infinite compact F-space can be either locally connected\nor HS. In [13], van Mill constructs, under the Continuum Hypothesis, a locally connected continuum with no nontrivial convergent sequences. Van Mill's example,\n\u2217\n\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification: Primary 54D05, 54D65.

Here, we\nshall replace the Hilbert cubes by one-dimensional Peano continua (i.e., connected,\nlocally connected, compact metric spaces) to obtain a one-dimensional limit space.\nOur Z = Z\u03c91 will be the limit of an inverse system hZ\u03b1 : \u03b1 < \u03c91 i. Each Z\u03b1 will\nbe a copy of the Menger sponge [11] (or Menger curve) MS; this one-dimensional\nPeano continuum has homogeneity properties similar to those of the Hilbert cube.\nThe basic properties of MS are summarized in Section 2, and Theorem 1.1 is proved\nin Section 3.\nIn [13], as well as in earlier work by Fedorchuk [7] and van Douwen and Fleissner [3], one kills all possible nontrivial convergent sequences in \u03c91 steps. Here, we\nfocus primarily on obtaining an S-space, modifying the construction of the original\nFedorchuk S-space [6]; we follow the exposition in [4], where the lack of convergent\nsequences occurs only as an afterthought.\nWe do not know whether one can obtain Z so that it satisfies Theorem 1.1\nwith the stronger property ind(Z) = 1; that is, the open U \u2286 Z with \u2202U zerodimensional form a base. In fact, we can easily modify our construction to ensure\nthat 1 = dim(Z) < ind(Z) = \u221e; this will hold because (as in [4]) we can give Z the\nadditional property that all perfect subsets are G\u03b4 sets; see Section 5 for details.\nWe can show that a Z satisfying Theorem 1.1 cannot have the property that the\nopen U \u2286 Z with \u2202U scattered form a base; see Theorem 4.12 in Section 4. This\nstrengthening of ind(Z) = 1 is satisfied by some well-known Peano continua. It is\nalso satisfied by the space produced in [8] under \u2666 by an inductive construction\nrelated to the one we describe here, but the space of [8] was not locally connected,\nand it had nontrivial convergent sequences (in fact, it was hereditarily Lindel\u00f6f).\n\n2\n\nOn Sponges\n\nThe Menger sponge MS [11] is obtained by drilling holes through the cube [0, 1]3 ,\nanalogously to the way that one obtains the middle-third Cantor set by removing\nintervals from [0, 1]. The paper of Mayer, Oversteegen, and Tymchatyn [12] has a\nprecise definition of MS and discusses its basic properties.\nIn proving theorems about MS, one often refers not to its definition, but to the\nfollowing theorem of R. D. Anderson [1, 2] (or, see [12]), which characterizes MS.\nThis theorem will be used to verify inductively that Z\u03b1 \u223c\n= MS. The fact that MS\nsatisfies the stated conditions is easily seen from its definition, but it is not trivial to\nprove that they characterize MS.\nTheorem 2.1 MS is, up to homeomorphism, the only one-dimensional Peano continuum with no locally separating points and no non-empty planar open sets.\n\n\f2 ON SPONGES\n\n3\n\nHere, C \u2286 X is locally separating iff, for some connected open U \u2286 X, the set\nU \\ C is not connected. A point x is locally separating iff {x} is. This notion\nis applied in the Homeomorphism Extension Theorem of Mayer, Oversteegen, and\nTymchatyn [12]:\nTheorem 2.2 Let K and L be closed, non-locally-separating subsets of MS and let\nh : K \u0589 L be a homeomorphism. Then h extends to a homeomorphism of MS onto\nitself.\nThe non-locally-separating sets have the following closure property of Kline [9]\n(or, see Theorem 2.2 of [12]):\nS\nTheorem 2.3 Let X be compact and locally connected, and let K = {Ki : i \u2208 \u03c9},\nwhere K and the Ki are closed subsets of X. If K is locally separating then some Ki\nis locally separating.\nFor example, these results imply that in MS, all convergent sequences are equivalent. More precisely, points in MS are not locally separating, so if hxi : i \u2208 \u03c9i\nconverges to x\u03c9 , then {xi : i \u2264 \u03c9} is not locally separating. Thus, if hsi i and hti i\nare nontrivial convergent sequences in MS, with limit points s\u03c9 and t\u03c9 , respectively,\nthen there is a homeomorphism of MS onto itself that maps si to ti for each i \u2264 \u03c9.\nThe following consequence of Theorem 2.1 was noted by Prajs [14] (see p. 657).\nLemma 2.4 Let J \u2286 MS be a non-locally-separating arc and obtain MS/J by collapsing J to a point. Then MS/J \u223c\n= MS and the natural map \u03c0 : MS \u0589 MS/J is\nmonotone.\nHere, a map f : Y \u0589 X is called monotone iff each f \u22121 {x} is connected; so,\nthe monotonicity in Lemma 2.4 is obvious. When X, Y are compact, monotonicity\nimplies that f \u22121 (U) is connected whenever U is a connected open or closed subset\nof X.\nWe shall use these results to show that the property of being a Menger sponge\nwill be preserved at the limit stages of our construction:\nLemma 2.5 Suppose that \u03b3 is a countable limit ordinal and Z\u03b3 is an inverse limit\nof hZ\u03b1 : \u03b1 < \u03b3i, where all bonding maps \u03c0\u03b1\u03b2 are monotone and each Z\u03b1 \u223c\n= MS. Then\n\u223c\nZ\u03b3 = MS.\nProof. We verify the conditions of Theorem 2.1. dim(Z\u03b3 ) = 1, since this property\nis preserved by inverse limits of compacta, and Z\u03b3 is locally connected because the\n\u03c0\u03b1\u03b2 are monotone. So, we need to verify that Z\u03b3 has no locally separating points and\nno non-empty planar open sets.\n\n\f4\n\n2 ON SPONGES\n\nSuppose that q \u2208 Z\u03b3 is locally separating; so we have a connected neighborhood\nU of q with U\\{q} not connected. Shrinking U, we may assume that U = (\u03c0\u03b1\u03b3 )\u22121 (V ),\nwhere \u03b1 < \u03b3 and V is open and connected in Z\u03b1 . Since Z\u03b1 \u223c\n= MS, \u03c0\u03b1\u03b3 (q) is\n\u03b3\nnot locally separating, so V \\{\u03c0\u03b1 (q)} is connected. Then, since \u03c0\u03b1\u03b3 is monotone,\n(\u03c0\u03b1\u03b3 )\u22121 (V \\{\u03c0\u03b1\u03b3 (q)}) = U \\ (\u03c0\u03b1\u03b3 )\u22121 {\u03c0\u03b1\u03b3 (q)} is connected. The same argument shows\n\u03b3 \u22121\n\u03b3\nthat\n\u03b2 ) {\u03c0\u03b2 (q)} is connected whenever \u03b1 \u2264 \u03b2 < \u03b3. But then U\\{q} =\nS U \\ \u03b3(\u03c0\u22121\n{U \\ (\u03c0\u03b2 ) {\u03c0\u03b2\u03b3 (q)} : \u03b1 \u2264 \u03b2 < \u03b3} is connected also.\nSuppose that U \u2286 Z\u03b3 is open and non-empty; we show that U is not planar.\nShrinking U, we may assume that U = (\u03c0\u03b1\u03b3 )\u22121 (V ), where \u03b1 < \u03b3 and V is open in\nZ\u03b1 . Since Z\u03b1 \u223c\n= MS, there is a K5 set F \u2286 V ; that is, F consists of 5 distinct points\np0 , p1 , p2 , p3 , p4 together with arcs Ji,j with endpoints pi , pj for 0 \u2264 i < j < 5, where\nthe sets Ji,j \\ {pi , pj }, for 0 \u2264 i < j < 5, are pairwise disjoint. Now F is not planar,\nand, one can show that (\u03c0\u03b1\u03b3 )\u22121 (F ) is not planar either. To do this, use the fact that\n\u03c0\u03b1\u03b3 is monotone, so that the sets (\u03c0\u03b1\u03b3 )\u22121 {pi } and (\u03c0\u03b1\u03b3 )\u22121 (Ji,j ) are all continua.\n\n\u00a9\n\nThe following terminology was used also in the exposition in [4] of the Fedorchuk\nS-space:\nDefinition 2.6 Let F be a family of subsets of X. Then x \u2208 X is a strong limit\npoint of F iff for all neighborhoods U of x, there is an F \u2208 F such that F \u2286 U and\nx\u2208\n/ F.\nIn practice, we shall only use this notion when the elements of F are closed. If\nall elements of F are singletons, this reduces to the usual notion of a point being a\nlimit point of a set of points.\nThe map \u03c0\u03b1\u03b1+1 : Z\u03b1+1 \u0589 Z\u03b1 will always be obtained by collapsing a non-locallyseparating arc in Z\u03b1+1 to a point. We obtain it using:\nLemma 2.7 Assume that X \u223c\n= MS and that for n \u2208 \u03c9, Fn is a family of non-locallyseparating closed subsets of X. Fix t \u2208 X such that t is a strong limit point of each\nFn . Then there is a Y \u223c\n= MS and a monotone \u03c0 : Y \u0589 X such that \u03c0 \u22121 {t} is a\nnon-locally-separating arc in Y , |\u03c0 \u22121 {x}| = 1 for all x 6= t, and, for each n and each\ny \u2208 \u03c0 \u22121 {t}: y is a strong limit point of {\u03c0 \u22121 (F ) : F \u2208 Fn }.\nProof. First, let {An : n \u2208 \u03c9} partition \u03c9 into disjoint infinite sets. In X, choose\ndisjoint closed Fi 6\u220b t for i \u2208 \u03c9 such that Fi \u2208 Fn whenever i \u2208 An , and suchSthat\nevery neighborhood of t contains all but finitely many of the Fi . Let L = {t} \u222a i Fi .\nThen L is closed and non-locally-separating by Theorem 2.3.\nNow, in MS, let J be any non-locally-separating arc. Choose disjoint closed nonlocally separating sets Gi for i \u2208 \u03c9 such that each Gi \u223c\n= Fi , every neighborhood of J\ncontains all but finitely many Gi , each Gi \u2229 J = \u2205, and for each n and each y \u2208 J:\ny is a strong limit point of {Gi : i \u2208 An }.\n\n\f5\n\n3 THE INVERSE LIMIT\n\nLet \u03c3 : MS \u0589 MS/J be the usual projection, and let [J] denote the point to\n\u223c\nwhich \u03c3 collapses\nS the set J. Then MS/J = MS by Lemma 2.4. In MS/J, let\nK = {[J]} \u222a {\u03c3(Gi ) : i \u2208 \u03c9}. Let h : K \u0589 L be a homeomorphism such that\nh([J]) = t and each h(\u03c3(Gi )) = Fi . By Theorem 2.2, h extends to a homeomorphism\ne\nh : MS/J \u0589 X.\nNow, let Y = MS and let \u03c0 = e\nh \u25e6 \u03c3.\n\n\u00a9\n\nThe next lemma will simplify somewhat the description of our inverse limit:\nLemma 2.8 In Lemma 2.7, we may obtain Y \u2286 X \u00d7 [0, 1], with \u03c0 : Y \u0589 X the\nnatural projection.\nProof. Start with any Y, \u03c0, t satisfying Lemma 2.7, and let J := \u03c0 \u22121 {t}. Apply\nthe Tietze Extension Theorem to fix f : Y \u0589 [0, 1] such that f \u21beJ : J \u0589 [0, 1] is\na homeomorphism. Then y 7\u2192 (\u03c0(y), f (y)) is one-to-one on Y , and hence Ye :=\n{(\u03c0(y), f (y)) : y \u2208 Y } \u2286 X \u00d7 [0, 1] satisfies Lemma 2.8.\n\n\u00a9\n\nThe following additional property of our \u03c0 will be useful:\nLemma 2.9 Let t and \u03c0 : Y \u0589 X be as in Lemma 2.7 or 2.8. Assume that H \u2286 X\nis closed and nowhere dense and not locally separating. Then \u03c0 \u22121 (H) \u2286 Y is closed\nand nowhere dense and not locally separating.\nProof. \u03c0 \u22121 (H) is closed and nowhere dense because \u03c0 is continuous and irreducible.\nAlso note that \u03c0 \u22121 (H) is not locally separating if either H = {t} (trivially) or t \u2208\n/H\n\u22121\n(because \u03c0 is a homeomorphism in a neighborhood of \u03c0 (H)).\nNext, note that every closed K \u2286 H is non-locally-separating in X: If not, let\nU \u2286 X be connected and open with U\\K not connected, so that U\\K = W0 \u222a W1 ,\nwhere the Wi are open in X, non-empty, and disjoint.

Let z = \u03c3\u03b1\u03c91 (q \u03b1 ). Applying (C8)\nwith \u03b2 = \u03c91 , we have in Z: all points of (\u03c3\u03b1\u03c91 )\u22121 {z} are strong limit points of\n{(\u03c3\u03b1\u03c91 )\u22121 {q\u03b1\u03be } : \u03be < \u03b1}.

We first note that if there were\nsuch a base, we could take the basic open sets U to be regular, since \u2202(int(cl(U))) \u2286\n\u2202U. To simplify notation, we define:\nDefinition 4.1 ro(X) denotes the algebra of regular open subsets of X, and acl(X)\n(the almost clopen sets) denotes the family of regular open sets U such that \u2202U is\nfinite. For U \u2208 ro(X), let U \u2201 denote the boolean complement (X\\U)\u25e6 .\nNote that acl(X) is a boolean subalgebra of ro(X): If U \u2208 acl(X) and W = U \u2201 ,\nthen \u2202W = \u2202U, so W \u2208 acl(X). Also, if U, V \u2208 acl(X) and W = U \u2227 V = U \u2229 V \u2208\nro(X), then W \u2208 acl(X) because \u2202(W ) \u2286 \u2202(U) \u222a \u2202(V ).\nIn a locally connected space, the connected components of an open set U are\nopen; if V is any such component, then \u2202V \u2286 \u2202U (because V is relatively clopen in\nU), so V \u2208 acl(X) whenever U \u2208 acl(X). Thus,\nLemma 4.2 If X is locally connected and acl(X) is a local base at p \u2208 X, then\n{U \u2208 acl(X) : p \u2208 U & U is connected } is also a local base at p.\nVarious LOTS sums have bases of almost clopen sets. This is true, for example,\nfor any compact hedgehog consisting of a central point plus arbitrarily many LOTS\nspines.

Define\nX\u03b1 = \u03c0\u03b1\u03c91 (X) \u2286 [0, 1]\u03b1 . Then there is a club C \u2286 \u03c91 such that X\u03b1 is locally connected\nfor all \u03b1 \u2208 C, and such that \u03c3\u03b1\u03b2 := \u03c0\u03b1\u03b2 \u21beX\u03b2 is monotone whenever \u03b1 < \u03b2 and \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208\nC \u222a {\u03c91 }.\nProof. Let B be the family of all connected open F\u03c3 subsets of X. Then B is a base\nfor X. For \u03b1 < \u03c91 , let B\u03b1 be the family of all open U \u2286 X\u03b1 such that (\u03c3\u03b1\u03c91 )\u22121 (U) \u2208 B.\nObserve that each U \u2208 B\u03b1 is connected. Put \u03b1 \u2208 C iff B\u03b1 is a base for X\u03b1 . Then C\nis club.\nNow, it is sufficient to show that (\u03c3\u03b1\u03c91 )\u22121 {x} is connected wheneverT\u03b1 \u2208 C and\nT x\u2208\nX\u03b1 . Choose Un \u2208 B\u03b1 with x \u2208 Un \u2287 Un+1 for all n \u2208 \u03c9 and {x} = n Un = n Un .\nEach (\u03c3\u03b1\u03c91 )\u22121 (Un ) is in B, so it and its closure are connected, and cl((\u03c3\u03b1\u03c91 )\u22121 (Un+1 )) \u2286\n(\u03c3\u03b1\u03c91 )\u22121 (Un+1 ) \u2286 (\u03c3\u03b1\u03c91 )\u22121 (Un ), so that (\u03c3\u03b1\u03c91 )\u22121 {x} is the decreasing intersection of the\nconnected closed sets cl((\u03c3\u03b1\u03c91 )\u22121 (Un )), and is hence connected.\n\n\u00a9\n\nWe do not know if conditions (C1 \u2013 C10) in Section 3 determine ind(Z), but a\nminor addition to the construction will ensure that Z does not have small transfinite\ninductive dimension; that is, trind(Z) = \u221e (and hence ind(Z) = \u221e). The transfinite\ninductive dimension trind is the natural generalization of ind; see [5].\nTheorem 5.2 Assuming \u2666, there is a locally connected HS continuum Z such that\ndim(Z) = 1, trind(Z) = \u221e, and Z has no nontrivial convergent sequences.\nTo do this, we make sure that all perfect subsets are G\u03b4 sets. Observe that by local\nconnectedness, every non-empty closed G\u03b4 contains a non-empty connected closed\nG\u03b4 subset, which in our Z cannot be a singleton. So, no non-empty closed G\u03b4 can\nhave dimension 0.\n\n\f12\n\n5 FURTHER REMARKS\n\nLemma 5.3 Assume that X is compact, connected, and infinite, and all perfect\nsubsets of X are G\u03b4 sets. Assume also that \u03c7(x, X) > \u05d00 for all x \u2208 X, and that in\nX, every non-empty closed G\u03b4 set contains a non-empty closed connected G\u03b4 subset.\nThen trind(X) = \u221e.\nProof. We prove by induction on ordinals \u03b1 that \u00ac[trind(X) \u2264 \u03b1] for all such\nX. This is obvious for \u03b1 = 0. Assume \u03b1 > 0 and the inductive hypothesis holds for\nall ordinals \u03be < \u03b1. Suppose that trind(X) \u2264 \u03b1. Then there is a regular open set U\nsuch that U 6= \u2205, U 6= X, and trind(\u2202U) = \u03be < \u03b1. Let V = X\\U; then U and V are\nperfect, so \u2202U = U \u2229 V is a G\u03b4 , and hence contains a non-empty closed connected\nG\u03b4 subset Y . Then trind(Y ) \u2264 trind(\u2202U) \u2264 \u03be. Since Y satisfies the conditions of\nthe lemma, this is a contradiction.\n\n\u00a9\n\nBy the same argument, this space is weird in the sense of [8]; that is, no perfect\nsubset is totally disconnected.\nTo construct our Z so that perfect sets are G\u03b4 , we observe first that if Q \u2286\nMS \u00d7 [0, 1]\u03c91 is perfect, then C := {\u03b1 < \u03c91 : \u03c0\u03b1\u03c91 (Q) is perfect} is a club. One might\nthen use \u2666, as in [4], to capture perfect subsets of Z, but this is not necessary, since\nwe already know that Z is HS, and we are already capturing countable sequences.\nThus, we get:\nConditions 5.4 We have P\u03b1 and P\u03b1 for \u03b1 < \u03c91 such that:\nC11. P\u03b1 = cl(Z\u03b1 \u2229 {q\u03b1n : n \u2208 \u03c9}) whenever \u03b1 \u2265 \u03c9 and this set is perfect; otherwise,\nP\u03b1 = Z \u03b1 .\nC12. P\u03b1 = {(\u03c3\u03b4\u03b1 )\u22121 (P\u03b4 ) : \u03b4 \u2264 \u03b1}.\nC13. \u03c3\u03b1\u03b1+1 \u21be ((\u03c3\u03b1\u03b1+1 )\u22121 (P )) : (\u03c3\u03b1\u03b1+1 )\u22121 (P ) \u0589 P is irreducible for each P \u2208 P\u03b1 .\nProof of Theorem 5.2. To obtain these conditions, note that (C13) is trivial\nfor P unless t\u03b1 \u2208 P . If t\u03b1 \u2208 P , then, since P is perfect, we may choose a sequence\nof distinct points hpn : n \u2208 \u03c9i from P \\{t\u03b1} converging to t\u03b1 . Then, while we are\naccomplishing (C8), we make sure that all points of (\u03c3\u03b1\u03b1+1 )\u22121 {t\u03b1 } are (strong) limit\npoints of the set of singletons, {(\u03c3\u03b1\u03b1+1 )\u22121 {pn } : n \u2208 \u03c9}; this implies irreducibility.\nNow, we prove by induction on \u03b2 \u2265 \u03b1 that \u03c3\u03b1\u03b2 \u21be ((\u03c3\u03b1\u03b2 )\u22121 (P )) : (\u03c3\u03b1\u03b2 )\u22121 (P ) \u0589 P\nis irreducible for each P \u2208 P\u03b1 . Then, if Q \u2286 Z is perfect, we use HS and (C7) to fix\nsome \u03b1 < \u03c91 such that P\u03b1 = \u03c3\u03b1\u03c91 (Q) and P\u03b1 is perfect. Irreducibility then implies\nthat Q = (\u03c3\u03b1\u03c91 )\u22121 (P\u03b1 ), which is a G\u03b4 .\n\n\u00a9\n\nFinally, we remark that our space Z is dissipated in the sense of [10], since in\nthe inverse limit, only one point t\u03b1 gets expanded in passing from Z\u03b1 to Z\u03b1+1 ; the\ninverse projection of every other point is a singleton. As pointed out in [10], this is\nalso true of the original Fedorchuk S-space [6], where one point t\u03b1 got expanded to\na pair of points; here, and in [8] and van Mill [13], t\u03b1 gets expanded to an interval.\n\n\fREFERENCES\n\n13\n\nReferences\n[1] R.
