There are strong similarities between Fermi gases in the unitary\nregime and high Tc superconductors. Here we address key issues of common interest, especially the pseudogap.\nIn the Fermi gases we summarize recent experiments including various phase diagrams (with and without\npopulation imbalance), as well as evidence for a pseudogap in thermodynamic and other experiments.\nKeywords: high Tc superconductor, ultracold Fermi gas, superfluidity, Feshbach resonance\n\nSuperfluidity in ultracold trapped fermionic gases has been\none of the most exciting, rapidly evolving research subjects in\nthe past few years. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. It has captured the attention of both condensed matter and atomic physics community, as well as other fields such as nuclear and quark matter\n[7]. Atomic Fermi gases have strong similarities to superconductors. Breakthroughs in cooling techniques in recent years\nhave made it possible to cool an atomic Fermi gas to quantum\ndegeneracy temperature and thus form a superfluid. What is\nremarkable about the atomic Fermi gases is their tunability\nand controllability. Using a Feshbach resonance, one can tune\nthe attractive two-body interaction from weak to strong, and\nthereby make a smooth crossover from a BCS type of superfluid to a Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) [8]. BCS-BEC\ncrossover has been of interest to the condensed matter community for a long time, and has been argued [9] to be relevant\nto high Tc superconductivity.\nMost of the theories that are proposed to explain high Tc\nsuperconductivity are based on the pairing of electrons, as in\nBCS theory. While the pairing mechanism in the cuprate superconductors is far from being clear, there is no ambiguity\nabout the pairing interaction in atomic Fermi gases. The attractive pairing potential between the fermionic atoms of different spins has been well characterized and can be computed\nfrom first principle quantum mechanics calculations. Here we\npresume that cuprate superconductivity originates from electron pairing, so that studying superfluidity in atomic Fermi\ngases may provide insights into the high Tc superconductivity\nor vice versa [9, 10, 11].\nImportantly, preformed pairs are an inevitable consequence\nas the pairing interaction increases. At the unitary scattering limit, the superfluid transition temperature Tc is very high\nin units of the noninteracting Fermi energy EF . The atomic\nFermi gases often have a relatively higher transition temperature than the cuprates. For the latter Tc . 0.1EF is somewhat\nlower, owing in part to their low dimensionality. Except in the\nextreme BCS limit, preformed pairs contribute a fermionic excitation gap, i.e., a pseudogap, even in the normal state. Such\na pseudogap is common to both high Tc superconductors and\natomic Fermi gases.\nIn the absence of a population imbalance, superfluidity is\nassociated with a gas of fermions with dispersion \u03bek = \u01ebk \u2212\n\u03bc, subjected to an attractive interaction between two different\n\nspin states, Uk,k\u2032 = U \u03c6k \u03c6k\u2032 , where U < 0 is the coupling\nstrength. For the cuprates, \u01ebk = 2tk (2 \u2212 cos kx \u2212 cos ky ),\nand for atomic Fermi gases \u01ebk = k 2 /2m; \u03bc is the fermionic\nchemical potential, tk is the in-plane hopping integral, and we\nhave set the lattice constant to 1. Here and throughout, we\nassume natural units and set ~ = kB = c = 1. The function\n\u03c6k reflects the pairing symmetry. For the cuprates, \u03c6k =\ncos kx \u2212 cos ky ; for the Fermi gases, the interaction is shortranged, and taken to be a contact potential so that \u03c6k = 1.\nThe Hamiltonian is given by\nX\nH \u2212 \u03bcN =\n\u03bek a\u2020k\u03c3 ak\u03c3\nk\u03c3\n\n+\n\nX\n\nUk,k\u2032 a\u2020k+q/2\u2191 a\u2020\u2212k+q/2\u2193 a\u2212k\u2032 +q/2\u2193 ak\u2032 +q/2\u2191 ,\n\nkk\u2032 q\n\n(1)\nwhere a\u2020 (a) is the creation (annihilation) operator of the\nfermions. This picture is often referred to as a one-channel\nmodel. The physics of a Feshbach resonance can be described\nby a two-channel model, which includes an open-channel, as\nin the one-channel model, and a closed-channel, which represents the effects of di-atomic molecules of a different total\nspin. The two-channel Hamiltonian is given by\nX\nX\nH \u2212 \u03bcN =\n\u03bek a\u2020k,\u03c3 ak,\u03c3 +\n(\u01ebq + \u03bd \u2212 2\u03bc)b\u2020q bq\nq\n\nk,\u03c3\n\n+\n\nX\n\n\u2032\n\nU (k, k\n\n)a\u2020q/2+k,\u2191 a\u2020q/2\u2212k,\u2193 aq/2\u2212k\u2032 ,\u2193 aq/2+k\u2032 ,\u2191\n\nq,k,k\u2032\n\n+\n\n\u0011\nX\u0010\ng(k)b\u2020q aq/2\u2212k,\u2193 aq/2+k,\u2191 + h.c. ,\n\n(2)\n\nq,k\n\nwhere b\u2020 (b) is the creation (annihilation) operator for the\nclosed-channel molecules, whose dispersion is given by \u01ebq =\nq 2 /2M with M = 2m. Here \u03bd represents the magnetic detuning, which is used to tune the relative energy level splitting\nbetween the open- and closed-channels and thus change the\noverall effective interaction; the interaction increases as the\nfield decreases. The last line in Eq. (2) represents the coupling between the two channels, with g(k) = g\u03c6k .\nCurrent studies of atomic Fermi gases have concentrated\non 6 Li and 40 K. For both gases, the Feshbach resonances\n\n\f2\nwhich are used to enhance the pairing interaction have a very\nbig width. As a consequence, the closed-channel fraction\nbecomes negligible [6, 12] even though the closed channel\nmakes a big contribution to the effective pairing interaction.\nFor example, for 6 Li, both experiments [6] and our theoretical\ncalculations [12] have demonstrated that the closed-channel\npopulation is extremely small in the unitary regime (of the order of 10\u22125 \u2212 10\u22124 ) and remains small in the entire range of\nmagnetic field (i.e., pairing strength) which is accessed experimentally.\nThe net effect of this tiny closed-channel fraction is that, for\nmany purposes, one can use the one-channel model, Eq. (1),\nprovided one replaces U with the overall effective interaction,\nUef f (Q) \u2261 U + g 2 D0 (Q), where D0 (Q) \u2261 1/[i\u03a9n \u2212 \u01ebmb\nq \u2212\n\u03bd + 2\u03bc] is the bare propagator of the closed-channel bosons.\nExperimentally, the pairing interaction for atomic Fermi gases\nis usually parametrized by the dimensionless product, 1/kF a,\nwhere a is the s-wave inter-fermion scattering length, and kF\nis the Fermi wavevector defined in the noninteracting limit at\nT = 0, satisfying EF = kF2 /2m.\nIn this way both high Tc superconductors and atomic Fermi\ngases can be described by the same Hamiltonian but with different pairing symmetries and free-particle dispersions. The\nexistence of a big pseudogap and the short coherence length\nin the cuprates suggest that they are in the intermediate regime\nbetween BCS and BEC [9]. This is often referred to as the\n\"strongly interacting regime\" in atomic Fermi gases, and is\nthe most complex and interesting regime as well.\nOur pairing fluctuation theory uses a T -matrix formalism. Instead of providing a detailed derivation, which can\nbe found in Refs. [10, 11], here we recapitulate the key ingredients and observations of this formalism. Pairs consist\nof fermions which glue together via the attractive interaction,\nand the pair propagator represents a summation of multiple\nparticle-particle scattering processes. Fermions acquire selfenergy via creation and destruction of a pair and a hole. In\nBCS theory, such pairs would be just the Cooper pairs in\nthe condensate, and they contribute a self-energy \u03a3sc (K) =\n\u2212\u22062sc G0 (\u2212K)\u03c62k , where \u2206sc is the order parameter and\nG0 (K) is the bare fermion Green's function. [Throughout,\nwe\nnotation as in Ref. [10], K \u2261 (k, i\u03c9n ),\nP P\nP use a four-vector\nn\nk , etc., and \u03c9n is the Matsubara frequency.]\nK = T\nIn general, finite momentum\nP pairs contribute to the fermion\nself-energy via \u03a3pg (K) = Q tpg (Q)G0 (Q \u2212 K)\u03c62k , where\ntpg (Q) = 1/[1 + Uef fP\n(Q)\u03c7(Q)] is the T -matrix (pair propagator), with \u03c7(Q) =\nK G0 (Q \u2212 K)G(K) being the pair\nsusceptibility and G(K) the full fermion Green's function.\nBelow Tc , tpg (Q) diverges at Q = 0 so that we can approximate G0 (Q \u2212 K) \u2248 G0 (\u2212K) in \u03a3pg . As a result, we obtain\n\u03a3pg (K) \u2248 \u2212\u22062pg G0 (\u2212K)\u03c62k , with\nX\n\u22062pg \u2261 \u2212\ntpg (Q).\n(3)\nQ\n\nHere the key observation is that, under a reasonable approximation, the self-energy of the finite momentum pairs has the\nsame form as \u03a3sc (K). Since these finite momentum pairs do\nnot have phase coherence, their contributions lead to a pseudogap in the fermion dispersion. The total excitation gap \u2206 is\n\ngiven by\n\u22062 = \u22062sc + \u22062pg ,\n\n(4)\n\nand\np the fermionic quasiparticle dispersion becomes Ek =\n\u03bek2 + \u22062 \u03c62k . The fact that the gaps add in quadrature can\nbe understood from the observation that \u22062sc and \u22062pg are proportional to the density of the condensed and noncondensed\npairs, respectively.\nThe effective dispersion \u03a9q and chemical potential \u03bcpair\ncan be determined by a Taylor expansion of t\u22121\npg , which, after\nanalytical continuation (i\u03a9n \u2192 \u03a9 + i0+ ), can be written as\nt\u22121\npg = Z(\u03a9 \u2212 \u03a9q + \u03bcpair ),\n\n(5)\n\nwhere Z is the inverse residue [11], and we have neglected the\nsmall imaginary part [11]. The pairing instability condition, or\nequivalently the BEC condition for pairs, requires\nt\u22121\npg (0) = 0 ,\n\n(6)\n\nso that we have \u03bcpair = 0 below Tc . One can readily see\nthat \u2206pg \u2192 0 as T \u2192 0. Therefore, this finite T theory is\nconsistent with the BCS-Leggett ground state [8], which has\nbeen widely assumed in the literature.\nThe presence of the pseudogap necessarily suppresses the\nsuperfluid transition Tc . This can be seen from the relationship between \u2206 and T , as determined by a mean-field BCS\ngap equation: T decreases as \u2206 increases, and Tc simply corresponds to the lowest T at which \u2206 = \u2206pg .\nOur theory can be summarized in three self-consistent\nequations: the gap equation (6), the pseudogap equation (3),\nand the number equation\nX\nn=2\nG(K) .\n(7)\nK\n\nThey can be used to solve for \u2206, \u2206pg , \u2206sc , \u03bc and Tc as a\nfunction of U (or Uef f ) or 1/kF a and T .\nThe present theory naturally leads to the following important observations. (i) The fundamental statistical entities in\nthese superfluids are fermions. We measure the \"bosonic\" (or\npair) degrees of freedom indirectly via the fermionic gap parameter \u2206(T ). (ii) As we go from BCS to BEC, pairs will\nbegin to form at a temperature T \u2217 above Tc . This pair formation is associated with a normal state pseudogap. (iii) In\ngeneral there will be two types of excitations in these BCSBEC crossover systems. Importantly in the intermediate case\nthe excitations consist of a mix of both fermions and bosons.\nIt should be pointed out that effects of pairing fluctuations were first considered by Nozi\u00e9res and Schmitt-Rink [13].\nHowever, they only included them in the particle number\nequation; the absence of these effects in the gap equations\nnecessarily leads to internal inconsistencies, say, in computing\nthe superfluid density. In contrast to the present approach, the\nNSR scheme also predicts that Tc approaches its BEC asymptote from above for an s-wave superfluid in three-dimensional\n(3D) continuum space. The NSR treatment, due to its relative simplicity, has been used by others in the recent literature\n[14, 15].\n\n\f3\n8\n\n70\n\nEnergy (meV)\n\n50\n40\n\nNormal\n30\n20\n\n4\n\n2\n\nP.G.\n0\n\n10\n0\n0.0\n\n8.9 K\n13.7 K\n15.5 K\n17.6 K\n22.0 K\n\n6\n\n1/\u03bb2 (\u03bcm-2)\n\nTc\n\u2206(Tc)\n\u2206(0)\nT*\nTc\n\u2206(0)\nT*\n\n60\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\nS.C.\n0.1\n\n20\n\n15\n\n25\n\nT (K)\n0.2\n\n0.3\n4\n\nx\n\n3\n\n2\n\n-2\n\n1/!

[16].\n\n2\n\n1\n\nA self-consistent treatment of finite-momentum pair excitations is crucial. This is more so in atomic Fermi gases, where\none cannot directly measure the temperature except in the extreme BCS and BEC limits. Quantitatively reasonable knowledge of temperature effects is necessary in order to determine\ntemperature and related physical properties in the BCS-BEC\ncrossover regime.\nWe first apply our pairing fluctuation theory to high Tc superconductors. In Fig. 1 we plot the calculated phase diagram for Bi2 Sr2 CaCu2 O8+\u03b4 (Bi2212) and YBa2 Cu3 O7\u2212\u03b4\n(YBCO) single crystals, as well as present a comparison with\nexperimental data. The horizontal axis is the hole doping concentration per unit cell, x = 1 \u2212 n. Here we show theoretical\ncalculations and experimental data for zero T excitation gap\n\u2206(0), superconducting transition temperature Tc , and pairing\nonset temperature T \u2217 . We also show the theoretical result for\n\u2206(Tc ), the pseudogap at Tc .\nTo obtain this phase diagram, we fit with one parameter\n\u2212U/4t0 such that it gives the right value of Tc at optimal\ndoping around x = 0.15. Here t0 is the bare in-plane electron hopping matrix element, in the absence of the Coulomb\nrepulsion. It is related to tk via tk \u2248 t0 x. One would obtain essentially the same phase diagram, if one parametrized\nthe variable attractive interaction by simply fitting T \u2217 (x) to\nexperiment. Thus, the underdoped regime sees effectively a\nstronger pairing interaction, \u2212U/4tk . It is evident that our\nsimple model gives a (semi-)quantitatively satisfying phase\ndiagram, in agreement with experiment.\nIt should be noted that, in contrast to the s-wave, 3D Fermi\ngas, the d-wave symmetry and the lattice periodicity in the\ncuprates makes Tc vanish before the BEC regime can be\nreached as the couping strength increases [17].

[18] in\nthe extreme underdoped regime of YBCO.\n\nduces a lower critical doping xc in the phase diagram shown\nin Fig. 1.\nOther applications of BCS-BEC crossover theory to the\ncuprate superconductors include studies [10] of the quasiuniversal behavior of the normalized superfluid density\nns (T )/ns (0) as a function of T /Tc for various doping concentrations. Experimental data from Ref. [18] are plotted in\nthe lower panel of Fig. 2 for a series of very underdoped\ncuprates. The universality apparent in these data presents\na puzzle for conventional theories of the penetration depth\nwhich invoke only fermionic excitations of the condensate.\nThis is because the fermionic contributions are expected to\nreflect the strong variations in the excitation gap \u2206(x) associated with the different hole concentrations x, thereby leading to highly non-universal behavior. In the theory plot of\nthe upper panel (Figure 2) bosonic or pair excitations contribute an extra mechanism for destroying superfluidity. They\ncompensate for the decrease of the quasiparticle contribution\n(\u221d Tc (x)/\u2206(x)) as the system evolves from overdoping to\nunderdoping. As a result, the slope of the superfluid density\nremains nearly doping independent, with only a small system-\n\n\f4\n0.25\n\nTheory, noninteracting\nTheory, unitary\nNoninteracting\nUnitary\n\nN0/N =\n\n(T/TF)0\n\n0.20\n\n0.15\n0.10\n\n0.05\n\n4\n\nE/EF\n\n-0.020\n0.010\n0.025\n0.050\n0.075\n0.100\n0.125\n0.150\n0.175\n\n2\n\nT*\n0\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n1/k0Fa\n\n-0.5\n\n-1.0\n\n-1.5\n\n0\n\nTc = 0.29\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\nT/TF\n\nFigure 3: (color) Phase diagram of 40 K.

The comparison between theory and recent experiments from the UBC group [18] shows quite good\nagreement. Recently, the bosonic nature of the superfluid density in underdoped cuprates has also been recognized by other\ngroups [19, 20].\nWe turn now to experiments in cold atom systems. Here\nwe [11, 22] need to include the trap potential V (r). To this\nend, we use a local density approximation (LDA) by replacing \u03bc \u2192 \u03bc(r) \u2261 \u03bc \u2212 V (r). Here \u03bc \u2261 \u03bc(0) is the global\nchemical potential and V (r) = m\u03c9\u0304 2 r2 /2 for a harmonic trap\nwith mean angular frequency\nR \u03c9\u0304. The number constraint enters\nfor the entire trap, N = d3 r n(r). Below Tc , there exists a\nsuperfluid core within r < Rsc . For r > Rsc , \u03bcpair < 0, and\nthe gap equation has to be modified to reflect this non-zero\n\u03bcpair : t\u22121\npg (0) = Z\u03bcpair .\nBefore we compare with experiment, we have to know the\ntemperature of the system. Experimentally, temperature is\nmeasured at the BCS [1] or BEC end [23], before or after the\nexperiment is performed in the strongly interacting regime.\nThis BCS or BEC state is adiabatically connected to the state\nwhere experiments are done via a slow magnetic field sweep.\nBy including self-consistently finite momentum pair excitations, our pairing fluctuation theory enables us to calculate the\nentropy S(T ) at an arbitrary magnetic field. Then we can map\nthe physical temperature T onto that measured in the BCS or\nBEC limit, T 0 , or vice versa [24].\nIn Fig. 3, we show the phase diagram for 40 K and compare\nour calculations with experimental data [21]. Here all temperatures are measured in (or converted into) the free Fermi gas\nlimit. In addition, TF0 \u2261 kF0 /2m is the Fermi temperature at\nthe trap center in the noninteracting limit. The experimental\nsuperfluid phase boundary is given by the 1% condensate fraction contour line; it is hard to locate experimentally where the\ncondensate vanishes precisely. This should be compared with\n\nFigure 4: (color) Energy per particle as a function of T for 6 Li at\nunitarity. The fact that the experimental data (symbols) (and the two\ntheoretical curves) for noninteracting and unitary Fermi gases do not\nmerge until higher T \u2217 > Tc is consistent with the presence of a\nnormal state pseudogap. From Ref. [25].\n\nthe (red) theory curve. Here we [21] identify the condensate\nfraction with the superfluid density. The agreement between\nexperiment and theory is reasonably good. It should be noted\nthat both experiment and theory show a maximum around unitarity, 1/kF0 a = 0, which has also been observed in 6 Li phase\ndiagrams [3].\nWe next turn to a detailed comparison of theory and experiment for thermodynamics. Figure 4 presents a plot of energy E as a function of T comparing the unitary and noninteracting regimes for 6 Li. The solid curves are theoretical\nwhile the symbols are experimental data [25]. A realistic\nGaussian trap with the experimentally given trap depth was\nused. There has been a recalibration of the experimental temperature scale [25] in order to plot theory and experiment in\nthe same figure. The latter was determined via Thomas-Fermi\nfits to the density profiles [22]. To arrive at the calibration,\nwe applied the same fits to the theoretically produced density\nprofiles.\nGood agreement between theory and experiment is apparent in Fig. 4. It should be emphasized that there is no fitting\nparameter in our calculations. The temperature dependence\nof E reflects primarily fermionic excitations at the edge of\nthe trap [24], although there is a small bosonic contribution as\nwell. Importantly one can see the effect of a pseudogap in the\nunitary case. That is, the temperature T \u2217 is visible from the\nplots as that at which the non-interacting and unitary curves\nmerge. This corresponds roughly to T \u2217 \u2248 2Tc . Evidence of\na pseudogap at unitarity has also been observed more directly\nin a radio-frequency excitation gap experiment [23].\nFinally, we turn to the effects of population imbalance,\nwhich have recently been one of the hottest subjects in atomic\nFermi gases. We consider both the homogeneous system [26],\nas well as trapped case, which can be found in Refs. [27, 28].\nWe define n = n\u2191 + n\u2193 , \u03b4n = n\u2191 \u2212 n\u2193 , and the polarization\np = \u03b4n/n. There will be two number equations associated\nwith the two spin species.

The (red) curve labeled by\n\u2202 2 \u03a9(Tc )/\u2202\u22062 = 0 is determined at corresponding Tc . The line defined by a./T.c = 0 is given by the turning points (p, 1/kF a) where\n1/kF a reaches a local extremum as a function of Tc . At T = 0,\nthe entire region between the TcM F = 0 and the \u2202 2 \u03a9/\u2202\u22062 = 0\nlines is unstable against phase separation. However, a A stable polarized, intermediate temperature superfluid phase exists for the (yellow) shaded region. Homogeneous superfluids in the dotted region\nare unstable at any temperature. From Ref. [31].\n\npears consistent with experiment. More details can be found\nin Ref. [26].\nFinally, we show in Fig. 6 the phase diagram at unitarity for\na population-imbalanced Fermi gas in a harmonic trap with\nangular frequency \u03c9. Here 1/kF a = 0. Phase separation (labeled PS) occupies the lower T portion of the phase diagram,\nwhere the gap \u2206 jumps abruptly to zero at some trap radius.\nAt intermediate T , there is a (yellow-shaded) Sarma phase,\nwhere \u2206 vanishes continuously within the trap. It evolves\ninto a (dotted region) pseudogap (PG) phase as the superfluid\ncore vanishes at higher T . A normal (N) phase without pairing\nalways exists at even higher T . This phase diagram appears\nto be consistent with current experiments. One can easily see\nthat the physics associated with population imbalance is much\nricher than in the absence of imbalance.\nIn conclusion, in this paper we have addressed commonalities particularly associated with the phase diagrams of ultracold trapped fermionic gases and high Tc superconductors.\nThese common features revolve around the scenario [9, 11]\nthat the cuprates are somewhere intermediate between BCS\nand BEC. Importantly, this scenario has been directly realized in trapped Fermi gases. Here one sees considerable evidence for pre-formed pairs and the related fermionic pseudogap which appear reminiscent of their cuprate counterparts.\nThis work was supported by NSF PHY-0555325 and NSFMRSEC Grant No. DMR-0213745.\n0.3\n\nconventionally called the \"Sarma\" phase [29], although here it\nis generalized away from the BCS limit originally considered\nby Sarma. Details are given in Ref. [26].\nIn Fig. 5, we present the zero T phase diagram for a population imbalanced homogeneous Fermi gas in the p \u2212 1/kF a\nplane. Here TcMF is the solution of Tc in a strict mean-field\ntreatment. \u03a9 is the thermodynamic potential. A superfluid\nsolution is stable only if \u2202 2 \u03a9/\u2202\u22062 > 0. From this figure,\nwe see that at any p 6= 0, there is a minimum threshold for\n1/kF a (determined by TcMF = 0) in order to have a superfluid solution. The point at which the solution becomes stable\n(determined by \u2202 2 \u03a9/\u2202\u22062 = 0) occurs in BEC regime. The\n(blue) dashed line indicates where Tc vanishes. The dotted region (as well as the shaded region) in the figure indicates an\nunstable (Sarma) superfluid phase at T = 0. The stable phases\nin this region are presumed to be either phase separated (PS)\nor possibly a Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov state [30].\nIn addition to the zero T phases, we also show in Fig. 5\nwhere the system is stable at Tc . A stable finite temperature polarized superfluid exists in the (yellow) shaded region.\nThis is a very interesting prediction of our theory which ap-\n\nFigure 6: (color) Phase diagram of a population-imbalanced Fermi\ngas in a harmonic trap at unitarity.
