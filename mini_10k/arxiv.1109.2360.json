Later papers in this series will explore\nthe stellar population and star formation history of LSB galaxies using this dataset.\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe key to understanding the evolution of late-type galaxy systems is their star formation\nhistory. For while a majority of their stellar mass originates from the epoch of galaxy formation,\ntheir current visual appearance is driven by star formation over the last Gyr (Gallagher et al. 1984).\nThus, studies of the characteristics of star forming galaxies is a glimpse into the process of star\nformation and, thus, a window into the conditions that played a role during the galaxy formation\nera.\nLate-type galaxies come in a range of morphological appearances and their study has been,\nfor decades, been dominated by the extremely bright, actively star forming examples such as NGC\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\n4449 (Huchra et al. 1983). The advent of newer all-sky surveys in the 1980's/90's demonstrated\nthe importance of low surface brightness (LSB) galaxies to the galaxy population, and opened up\na wider range of irregular late-type galaxies for study. Although initial suggestions were that LSB\ngalaxies dominate the total galaxy population of the Universe over their higher surface brightness\n(HSB) cousins, it was later found to be untrue (Rosenbaum & Bomans 2004, Hayward, Irwin &\nBergman 2005). Nonetheless, LSB galaxies offer a new avenue for the study of galaxy evolution,\nhaving low stellar densities and recent star formation rates. Their study, as a class of galaxies, has\nmerit for stellar population work.\nStar formation in galaxies falls into three crude categories: 1) hyper-efficient, typically associated with tidal or merger events (Whitmore et al. 2005), 2) normal, associated spiral galaxies under\ndensity wave or stochastic processes (Young et al. 1996) and 3) bursts followed by long quiescent\nperiods, typically associated with dwarf galaxies (Schombert et al. 2001). LSB galaxies, almost\nby definition, are found in the third category and are assumed to have had below average star\nformation rates for their entire lifetimes to explain their star-forming blue colors, yet low stellar\ndensities.\nThis project is focused on obtaining optical and H\u03b1 imaging of a sample of LSB galaxies with\nknown HI properties. For knowledge of the blue optical colors, H\u03b1 emission and HI gas mass\nprovides constraints on the dominant stellar population for the last few Gyrs, the current star\nformation rate and the potential total star formation rate (i.e., the amount of material available to\nproduce stars). Integrated values speak to the global history of star formation, but, in addition,\nspatial color and H\u03b1 information can distinguish between episodic bursts of star formation versus\nquasi-continuous modes (Gerola, Seiden & Schulmann 1980, van Zee 2001).\nIn this paper, we present color and H\u03b1 imaging for a large sample of LSB galaxies, not restricted\nby size or total luminosity. As these galaxies also have aperture HI measurements, this sample\nwill comprise one of the largest sets of LSB galaxy data to date with complete stellar and gas\nobservations. We will present the techniques, analysis and reduced data for B, V and H\u03b1 imaging\nand comparison to other samples, but will reserve interpretation and modeling for later papers. We\nwill also present the data in a new format so that interested readers can extract the reduced values\nas well as the scripts that were used to convert the apparent values to astronomically meaningful\nvalues. This brings a new level of transparency to datasets where the individual can not only follow\nthe corrections and transformations applied to the raw data, but substitute their own values and\nseamlessly produce their own final datasets.\n\n2.\n\nSample Selection and Observations\n\nOur sample of LSB galaxies was primarily selected from the catalog of Schombert et al. (1992)\nand Schombert, Pildis & Eder (1997). Those project's goals were to observe a large number of\nLSB dwarf galaxies to test biased galaxy formation scenarios. The resulting sample was by no\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\n\nFig. 1.-: An example visual summary chart for galaxy D723-9. The top left panel is a high\ncontrast V image (to emphasize LSB features), axes are in pixel units, north at top, east to left.\nThe top right panel is a low contrast V image with foreground stars removed. The middle left\npanel is the B \u2212V color map (blue is B \u2212V = 0, red is B \u2212V = 1). The middle right panel is the\nH\u03b1 emission. The lower left panel is the B \u2212 V color profile (open symbols are differential color,\nsolid line is integrated color). Redshift, distance, central surface brightness and scalelength (\u03b1)\nare also listed.

The one-to-one correspondence line is shown in blue. The mean difference is only\n0.01 mags. The larger disagreement for the brightest galaxies (F561-1 and F651-2) is due to\nthe our technique of replacing stars with galaxy light.\n\nmeans restricted to dwarf galaxies (LSB appearance does not correlate with galaxy mass, Pildis,\nSchombert & Eder 1997). A number of LSB galaxies from the original PSS-II catalog (Schombert\n& Bothun 1988) were also included. The basic criteria for the PSS-II catalog was to find objects\nthat simply do not fit into the normal Hubble sequence, such as spirals or HSB irregulars, and were\nLSB in character (this visual selection was later determined to be approximately \u03bcc > 23 V mag\narcsec\u22122 ).\nTarget selection for follow-up optical and H\u03b1 imaging used a combination of object morphology,\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nredshift and position in the sky. Astrophysically, we wished to sample a range of sizes, luminosities\nand HI masses. Filter constraints for H\u03b1 imaging restricted the redshift range to less than 8,000\nkm/sec. All the objects are between \u221210 and +30 declination (the Arecibo window). Observing\nschedules restricted the right ascension window to between 23H and 4H in the fall, 8H and 13H\nin the spring. An effort was made to avoid galaxies with clear spiral patterns, as they have been\nstudied by others (Kennicutt et al. 2008).\nThe final sample is given in Tables 1 and 2. The columns in Table 1 are as follows: 1) galaxy\nname, 2) run number (K, for KPNO, plus MMYY), 3) distance in Mpc (taken from NED), 4)\nabsolute V magnitude, 5) central surface brightness from exponential fit, 6) scalelength in kpc, also\nfrom an exponential fit, 7) mean B \u2212 V color, 8) mean V \u2212 I color and 9) axial ratio at the 25 V\nmag arcsecs\u22122 isophote. The columns in Table 2 are as follows: 1) galaxy name, 2) H\u03b1 flux, 3) H\u03b1\nluminosity, 4) stellar mass, following the prescription of Schombert et al. (2000), 5) HI gas mass,\nagain from Schombert et al. (2000), 6) baryon mass (stellar plus gas), 7) the gas fraction and the\nbirthrate function (SFR/M\u2217 ).\nWe imaged 59 LSB dwarfs and disks plus the well-studied dwarfs DDO154 and DDO168 for\ncomparison. The spiral galaxy UGC 128 was also imaged as a control HSB disk galaxy. Selection by\nmorphology for the original catalog did not exclude luminous or large galaxies, however, selection\nfor galaxies with redshifts less than 8,000 km/sec (to fit within the H\u03b1 filter set) eliminates the\nhigh redshift Malin cousins. We note that a late-type morphological criteria does select for galaxies\nwith high HI/L ratios (Schombert, Pildis & Eder 1997). The final sample ranges from MV = \u221219.5\nto \u221212.5 and from 0.1 to 5 kpc in scale length.\nThe imaging for this project was obtained during three runs (two spring: K0308 & K0309, one\nfall: K1007) on the KPNO 2.1m. A series of narrow band filters were used to acquire ON/OFF H\u03b1\nframes. The KPNO H\u03b1 filters used were 1391, 1494, 1563, 1564, 1565 and 1566. These filters are\n70\u00c5 wide centered at 6620, 6658, 6573, 6618, 6653 and 6709\u00c5 respectfully. This gave us velocity\ncoverage from 0 km/sec to 8,000 km/sec, which contains 80% of the Schombert LSB catalog. The\nON filter was selected to match the galaxy velocity, the OFF filter was nearest filter either above\nor below in velocity space.\nIn addition, deep B and V frames were obtained for every galaxy in the sample during the\nsame observing runs in order to perform two color surface photometry (B \u2212 V ). Typical exposure\ntimes were 3 sets of 150 sec V frames, 3 sets of 300 sec B frames and 6 pairs of 600 sec H\u03b1 ON/OFF\nframes (i.e. a total of one hour ON and one hour OFF). The plate scale is 0.61 arcsecs per pixel\nfor a field of view of 10.4 arcmins. Note that 23 of these galaxies were also imaged in V \u2212 I for\na previous project (Pildis, Schombert & Eder 1997), this was done on a different detector and\ntelescope and requires some processing to combine with the current sample.\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\n3.\n\nData Reduction\n\nData reduction followed the standard procedures for low readout noise CCD's. Dark subtraction used overscan regions. Image flattening used dome flats and no large scale features are seen to\nthe 0.1% level over the inner 80% of each frame. Calibration used Landolt (1992) standards for B\nand V , and Stone (1996) standards for the H\u03b1 filters. Standard KPNO airmass corrections were\napplied to all frames, although the greatest airmass observed was only 1.18. Multiple frames were\nregistered using internal stars then clipped-summed to eliminate cosmic rays.\nThe V frames were then registered, cleaned, then summed for ellipse and surface brightness\nfitting. Sky values were first determined by visually assigning sky boxes to regions free from other\nobjects. These sky boxes were recorded and used to determine sky in the B and H\u03b1 frames. Sky\nboxes are the most useful method of determining the true sky value for LSB galaxies as they register\nany large scale variations across the region around the galaxy as well as provide a measure of the\nrandom error (\u03c3 within each box) and a measure of the error on the mean value (the \u03c3 between\nthe means of each box). The error in the sky dominates most of the photometric values for LSB\ngalaxies. The typical errors in the mean sky value were between 0.1 and 0.2%. This corresponds\nto a 1\u03c3 sky error of 28.3 V mags arcsecs\u22122 .\nThe ellipse values for the V frames are used to define apertures for colors and H\u03b1 values.\nCleaning was an automatic process of the ellipse fitting routines (see ARCHANGEL, Schombert\n2007). However, in a few cases of nearby bright stars or embedded stars, these objects were\nmanually cleaned. Cleaned areas were re-filled using intensity values based on the averaged ellipse\nthat passed through each pixel. This was only significant for cleaned stars with the main body of\nthe galaxy and was never more than 4% the total luminosity of the galaxy.\nIsophotal analysis begins with fitting ellipses to the cleaned image. Fitting. a best ellipse to a\nset intensity values in a 2D image is a relatively straight forward technique that has been pioneered\nby Cawson et al. (1987) and refined by Jedrzejewski (1987) (see also an excellent review by MilvangJensen & Jorgensen 1999). The core routine from these techniques (PROF) was eventually adopted\nby STSDAS IRAF (i.e. ELLIPSE). The primary fitting routine for this project follows the same\ntechniques (in fact, uses much of the identical FORTRAN code from the original GASP package of\nCawson) with some notable additions.\nThese codes start at some intermediate distance from the galaxy core with an estimated xy center, position angle and eccentricity to sample the pixel data around the given ellipse. The\nvariation in intensity values around the ellipse can be expressed as a Fourier series with small\nsecond order terms. Then, an iterative least-squares procedure adjusts the ellipse parameters\nsearching for a best fit, i.e. minimized coefficients. There are several halting conditions, such as\nmaximum number of iterations or minimal/extreme change in the coefficients, which then moves\nthe ellipse outward for another round of iterations. Once a stopping condition is met (edge of\nthe frame or sufficiently small change in the isophote intensity), the routine returns to the start\nradius and completes the inner portion of the galaxy. A best fit ellipse is always found in all the\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\n\nFig. 3.-: Surface brightness profiles for six galaxies. Best fit exponentials are shown in\nblue. Fits are constrained to the outer portions of the galaxy with the clearest linear behavior.\n\nframes, although for the more irregular galaxies it is clear that an ellipse is a forced figure onto the\nisophotes. We will discuss the merit of this process in our structure paper.\nFinal fits were visually inspected for robustness, converted to 1D surface brightness profiles\nand fit to an exponential disk. A small number of objects had significant bulges, but r1/4 fits\nto the bulges did not significantly alter the disk fits due to the small bulge size. Both surface\nbrightness profiles, aperture magnitudes and color profiles are based on these fits. For consistency,\nthe V ellipse fits were applied to the B and H\u03b1 frames (after registration) to produce aperture\nluminosities and colors (i.e. the same pixels are integrated by aperture in all frames).\nAll the reduced values, single parameters (e.g., total luminosity) and array values (e.g., surface\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\n\nbrightness profiles) are all stored in XML format and placed at the data website (http://abyss.uoregon.edu/\u223cjs/lsb).\nIn addition, the data website contains the scripts (written in the Python computer language) which\nare used to convert raw telescope values into astronomical meaningful parameters. These well commented scripts allow the user to follow all the details for data reduction, rather than attempting\nto extract the procedures from the published text. Many of the calibrating values (e.g. Galactic\nextinction, CMB distance) are obtained over the network (e.g. NED), and those scripts are also\nfound at the website. In addition, we compare our values with galaxies in common from other\nstudies. However, certain parameters, such as distance, have changed since the original studies\nwere published. Thus, this script's procedures contain all the information to convert other datasets\ninto a common framework for comparison to our data.\nAn additional challenge is to visually present the data for a large range of galaxy sizes and\nmorphology. For it is the spatial color and intensity information that will address many of the star\nformation issues. Structural information is summarized by surface brightness profiles, which are\ndisplayed for all the galaxies at the data website.\nThe image information (appearance, H\u03b1 and color maps) are summarized in a fashion shown\nin Figure 1 (with the whole sample found at the data website). This visual summary includes\ntwo grayscale images (on the left at high contrast, on the right at low contrast with nearby stars\nremoved), a two color (B \u2212 V ) map (blue is B \u2212 V = 0.0, red is B \u2212 V = 1.0), a high contrast H\u03b1\nmap, the B \u2212 V color profile and list of the galaxy's structural parameters.\nNote that absolute values are based on distances taken from NED (NASA's Extragalactic\nDatabase) using the concordance model (i.e. NED's cosmology-corrected distance). All redshifts\nwere based on 21-cm HI measurements (Eder & Schombert 2000). For nearby objects in the Hunter\n& Elmegreen (2006) and van Zee (2001) samples, redshift independent distances (e.g. Cepheids)\nfrom NED were used where available.\n\n3.1.\n\nTotal Magnitudes/Colors\n\nTotal magnitudes and integrated colors used the cleaned frames where the cleaned areas are\nre-filled with estimated intensities from the fitted ellipses. While this is not perfectly accurate for\nirregularly shaped galaxies, the filled regions rarely contributed more than 4% the total light of a\ngalaxy.\nTotal magnitudes were determined using asymptotic fits to the aperture photometry (see\nSchombert 2007). Rather than using curves of growth (which are ill-defined for LSB galaxies),\nthese fits were made to (1) the raw pixel summed values, (2) the intensities calculated from the\nfitted ellipses, (3) extrapolation of luminosity from exponential fits to the surface photometry. For\nLSB galaxies, a larger fraction of their luminosity is found in their halo regions compared to HSB\ngalaxies. Unfortunately, these outer pixels are also the closest to sky values and suffer from the\nhighest errors. Thus, technique (1) frequently fails to converge due to noise at low levels. Likewise,\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\n\nFig. 4.-: The range of size and central surface brightness (V mag arcsecs\u22122 ) for the sample.\nAs demonstrated in early work, not all LSB galaxies are dwarf galaxies in terms of size (although\nthe LSB giants, e.g. F568-6, were excluded from the sample due to the restrictions on redshift\nrange).\n\ntechnique (3) is error prone due to the sensitivity of exponential fits to noisy outer isophotes.\nWe found reasonably stable total luminosity values using technique (2) extrapolating the\nisophotal intensities. Here the apertures are integrated to a user specified point (typically the\npoint where L = 80% LT ), then the mean intensities from the fitted ellipses are used to sum the\nremaining luminosity. For a majority of the galaxies imaged in this study, the total V magnitudes\nconverged using this technique with typical internal errors of 0.06 mags. They are listed in Table 1,\nerrors are assigned based on the error in the sky value (which dominates the noise in LSB images).\nAn external check to the integrated magnitudes is offered by comparison to the LSB sample\nfrom Hunter & Elmegreen (2006). There are eight objects in common with that study. Their\nidentifications and apparent magnitudes (corrected for galactic extinction) are shown in Figure 2.\nThe mean difference is only 0.01 mags, which is well within the formal errors of 0.06 mags.\nColors are calculated as integrated and differential colors using the V fitted ellipses as apertures.\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\n\nFig. 5.-: Galaxy morphology as a function of central surface brightness (\u03bcc ) and scalelength\n(\u03b1). This panel displays galaxies with scalelengths less than 1 kpc. Irregular morphology\ndominates LSB galaxies, although smooth morphology is the signature of a gas-poor LSB and,\ntherefore, would not be included in our sample due to a lack of an HI redshift. A larger version\nof this figure is available at our website.\n\nA large percentage of the LSB galaxies in this sample have highly variable colors in the spatial sense.\nAn integrated color does not capture the whole stellar population picture for many of these systems.\nOften a more accurate global color is one where the ellipses are used to determine differential color\n(the color of the annulus around each ellipse), then these annuli are averaged (weighted by the\nsurface brightness of the annuli). It is these weighted colors (out to the 25 V mag arcsecs\u22122\nisophote) that is listed in Table 1 as < B \u2212 V > and < V \u2212 I >.\nThe full color information is obtained from pixel-by-pixel two color maps. These maps are\nmade by registering to the V frame then binning 3x3. An example of a spatial map is shown in\nFigure 1. It is also possible to plot spatial color versus surface brightness (i.e. pixel color versus\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\n\nFig. 6.-: Galaxy morphology as a function of central surface brightness (\u03bcc ) and scalelength\n(\u03b1).

A larger version of this figure is available at our website.\n\nthat pixels surface brightness in V ). An example of that type of analysis is shown in \u00a73.5.\nA subset of the sample had been previously imaged in V \u2212 I (Pildis, Schombert & Eder 1997).\nWhile those colors are less accurate, their total values will be compared to the B \u2212 V colors in \u00a73.4\nand are found listed in Table 1. Spatial V \u2212 I color maps are made and re-pixeled to the same\norientation and scale of the newer B \u2212 V frames. This allows for a comparison of B \u2212 V and V \u2212 I\nnot only in total colors and color profiles, put also on a pixel-by-pixel basis.\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\n3.2.\n\nScale Length (\u03b1) and Central Surface Brightness (\u03bco )\n\nSurface photometry was extracted from the ellipse fitting using the standard techniques outlined in Schombert (2007). Due to their typically irregular morphology, LSB galaxies are notoriously\ndifficult to simplify into a 1D light profile. The procedure used herein is to convert the best fit\nellipses into a surface brightness profile of intensity versus semi-major axis. A section of the surface\nbrightness profile is selected in the outer regions of the galaxy with the most linear appearance.\nThis region is then fit to a straight line, interpolating to the core to extract the central surface\nbrightness (\u03bco ) and exponential scale length (\u03b1). Although the interiors of LSB galaxies are frequently poorly fit by an exponential profile, the exterior regions are often easily described by an\nexponential law. This is surprising given their irregular outer isophotes and is probably due to the\nfact that any high surface brightness lumps are restricted to their core regions.\nA series of example surface brightness fits are found in Figure 3. These profiles are a subset\nof the total sample demonstrating good and poor (e.g., F561-1) fits, as well as examples where\nan exponential fit may not be appropriate. The full set of surface brightness fits can be found at\nour data website. As can be seen from several of the surface brightness fits, the fitting technique\ncan lead to a mismatch between the central surface brightness as described by a fit to the galaxy's\nouter regions, versus a central surface brightness that actually represents the luminosity of the core\nregions. To fix this mismatch, the inner five arcsecs are also fit to extract a true central surface\nbrightness (which we will designate as \u03bcc to distinguish it from \u03bco from exponential fits) except in\ncases where there is a clear bulge-like central region (e.g., F574-1). No inclination corrections are\napplied to \u03bco since the intrinsic 3D shape of LSB galaxies is unknown (some are rotators, others\nare not, so a thin or thick disk correction would vary from galaxy to galaxy).\nThe range of size and central surface brightness is shown in Figure 4. Here size (RV 25 ) is\ndefined by the 25 V mag arcsecs\u22121 isophote major axis in kpcs. Central surface brightness is the\ninner interpolation to zero radius (in the case of a bulge and disk, interpolation of the disk). Sizes\nrange from 0.3 kpc to 10 kpc. LSB galaxies include both the smallest of dwarf galaxies up to\nmedium sized disk galaxies. The central surface brightnesses are all fainter than the Freeman value\n(21 V mag arcsecs\u22122 ), but do not include the extremely faint surface brightnesses (muo > 23 to 24\nmags arcsecs\u22122 ) found in recent digital surveys (Zhong et al. 2008, Adami et al. 2006), primarily\ndue to the limitations in the photographic medium used to discover the sample.\nTo further display the range in size and morphology, Figures 5 and 6 display a greyscale image\nof selected galaxies (stars removed) with respect to their central surface brightness and disk scale\nlength. Irregular morphology is most common at small scale lengths, although it would be difficult\nto predict which galaxies were dwarfs simply from an estimate based on their appearance. LSB\ngalaxies with smooth morphologies would probably be dE's and their lack of HI gas for redshift\ndetermination would exclude them from our samples. Flocculate spiral patterns are evident at scale\nlengths greater than 1 kpc (note, UGC 128 is a HSB counter-example).\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\n3.3.\n\nH\u03b1 Imaging\n\nThe most observationally intensive portion of this project was obtaining H\u03b1 images for the\nentire sample. The H\u03b1 emission for LSB galaxies is known to be below rates standard for late-type\ngalaxies (McGaugh, Schombert & Bothun 1995). Thus, we anticipated that a majority of telescope\ntime would be spent on ON/OFF exposures with narrow band filters. Indeed, we typically spent\n60 mins total on each object in the sample and were rewarded with a 93% success rate for H\u03b1\ndetection (all but four of our original 60 targets, see Table 1).\nThe high detection rate was surprising since, given the low surface densities and previous H\u03b1\nstudies on this sample (McGaugh, Schombert & Bothun 1995), there was an expectation that a\nmajority of LSB galaxies were in quiescent mode with no star formation in the last few Gyrs. H\u03b1\nsurveys of HI-rich galaxies (Meurer et al. 2006) and volume complete samples (Kennicutt et al.\n2008) have high detection rates, thus our pessimism seemed unwarranted. We note that the H\u03b1\nfluxes were extremely low (the mean is a factor of ten less than studies of gas-rich dwarfs, van Zee\n2001), and the four objects with non-detections were the reddest galaxies in the sample (suggesting\nan elliptical-like history of an initial burst, but very little star formation after that).\nOur observing technique was fairly standard. We used the KPNO H\u03b1 set, which cover the\nredshift range from zero to 10,000 km/sec with effective widths of 3,000 km/sec. Flattening used\ndome lamps. All the frames had noticeable curvature at the edges; however, all the sample galaxies\noccupied only the inner 20% of the chip. Calibration used Stone spectrophotometric standards\n(Stone 1996).\nThe distribution of H\u03b1 emission is typically irregular in galaxies, even for HSB spirals. The\nuse of elliptical apertures would introduce needless sky noise, so we adopted a system of mask\nphotometry to measure the H\u03b1 flux for each galaxy. For this sample, we use a boxcar smoothed\nH\u03b1 frame to define the initial mask. Peak H\u03b1 regions are located, then those regions are allowed\nto grow by 20%. All the masks are visually inspected and additional areas are added as needed\n(usually to capture diffuse emission areas). This technique has the advantage of minimizing sky\nnoise and allowing us to directly compare the B \u2212 V colors of the H\u03b1 pixels.\nThere is concern that diffuse H\u03b1 emission that is not visually detected would be excluded.\nTo test for this effect we plot the aperture values versus the grid photometry values in Figure\n7. The unity line is marked in blue, a linear fit with a fixed slope of one is shown in red. The\ndifference between the aperture values and the grid values is 40%. This additional H\u03b1 luminosity\nis, presumingly, diffuse H\u03b1 emission that was too low in surface brightness per pixel to be detected\nby our growth algorithms.\nWe note that this 40% difference is nearly identical to the value for diffuse emission found by\nvan Zee (2000) of 50%. Using the RV 25 radii, the radius where the surface brightness profile drops\nto 25 V mag arcsecs\u22122 , as compared to the area of detected H\u03b1 emission, we find that visible H\u03b1\ncovers a range from 5 to 25% the total area of the galaxy, with a mean value for the sample of\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\n\nFig. 7.-: Comparison of the H\u03b1 flux determined by grid photometry of the HII regions\nversus aperture photometry of the entire galaxy volume. The red line is a linear fit to the data,\nthe blue line is the one-to-one correspondence line. The aperture values are, on average, 40%\nhigher than the grid photometry values. This can be attributed to diffuse emission presumably\nspread throughout the galaxy's stellar population (van Zee 2000).\n\n10%. The diffuse H\u03b1 emits from this remaining 90% of the galaxy volume, presumably from the\nbluest regions. In order to capture all the H\u03b1 flux for star formation rate calculations, we have\nused our grid values (with the lowest errors) and increased them by 40% to account for the diffuse\ncomponent.\nThere are six galaxies in common, in terms of H\u03b1 fluxes, between our study and the work of\nHunter & Elmegreen (2004). The Hunter & Elmegreen is plotted against our values in Figure 8.\nThe average difference is 0.15 in log flux, the standard deviation for the eight galaxies is 0.4. There\nwas no correlation between apparent H\u03b1 flux and the residuals between the two samples.\nSince all our galaxies were imaged with the same number of ON/OFF exposures, we can\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\n\n-13.0\n\nF651-2\n\n-13.5\n\nlog fH\u03b1 (Hunter Elmegreen)\n\nF533-1\nF608-1\n-14.0\n\nF561-1\n\nF750-V1\nF563-V1\n\n-14.5\n\n-15.0\n\nF565-V2\n-15.5\n\n-16.0\n-16.0\n\nF615-1\n\n-15.5\n\n-15.0\n\n-14.5\n\n-14.0\n\nlog fH\u03b1 (this study)\n\n-13.5\n\n-13.0\n\nFig. 8.-: Comparison between H\u03b1 fluxes from Hunter & Elmegreen and this study. The\nblue line delineates a 1-to-1 correspondence. The average difference is 0.15 in log flux, the\nstandard deviation is 0.4 in log flux.\n\nestimate, based on the flatness H\u03b1 frames and integration times, that our upper limit for H\u03b1\ndetection is approximately 10\u221216 ergs s\u22121 cm\u22122 . Since our exposure times were similar from galaxy\nto galaxy, and night sky conditions also were stable during the run, we consider this upper limit to\nbe constant for this study. For the four galaxies without an H\u03b1 detection, this corresponds to log\nL(H\u03b1) between 36 and 37, which would be on the faint side of our L(H\u03b1) values.\nThe total H\u03b1 fluxes and H\u03b1 luminosities are listed in Table 2. The H\u03b1 fluxes are corrected\nfor an assumed [NII]6583+6548/H\u03b1 ratio of 0.1 (Hunter & Elmegreen 2004) and a factor of 40%\nto account for diffuse emission (see above). No corrections for dust extinction are made as LSB\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\n\n\u2193 \u2193\n\n40\n\n\u2193\n\n35\n30\n\nN\n\n25\n20\n15\n10\n5\n36\n\n37\n\n38\n\n39\n\nlog L(H\u03b1) (ergs s\u22121 )\n\n40\n\n41\n\n42\n\nFig. 9.-: Histogram of H\u03b1 luminosities (regular and normalized histograms). The black\ncurve is this sample, the red curve is the data from Hunter & Elmegreen for bright dwarf\nirregulars, the green curve is the data from van Zee, a sample of HI-rich dwarf galaxies. Arrows\nmark the mean value for each sample, the diamonds mark the median. Our sample is noticeably\nfainter than Hunter & Elmegreen sample primarily due to the nature of their sample selection.\nOur luminosities are similar to van Zee's, with a slightly lower mean L(H\u03b1).\n\ngalaxies have very few far-IR detections and the appropriate corrections are unclear. The resulting\nfluxes are then converted to L(H\u03b1) using the prescription given in van Zee (2001). A histogram of\nL(H\u03b1) values is shown in Figure 9. For comparison, the bright dwarf sample of Hunter & Elmegreen\n(2004) and van Zee (2001) are also shown. The mean H\u03b1 luminosity of our sample is about a factor\nof 3 fainter than Hunter & Elmegreen, but similar to van Zee's.\nThere is a strong correlation between absolute magnitude and L(H\u03b1). As can be seen in Figure\n10, the correlation between stellar luminosity (which measures stellar mass under an assumed IMF)\nand H\u03b1 luminosity is evident in both the van Zee and Hunter& Elmegreen samples (red symbols)\nand our LSB sample (black symbols). Neither H\u03b1 flux or apparent magnitude are correlated with\ndistance, so we believe that distance effects are not responsible for the correlation seen in Figure\n10. We note that there is a 0.5 shift in log L(H\u03b1) between our samples and the dwarf irregular\nsamples (lower H\u03b1 luminosities per stellar mass for the LSB galaxies). We have marked the eight\ngalaxies in common with Hunter & Elmegreen, a bias flux calibration for our sample does not seem\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\n\nFig. 10.-: Correlation between stellar mass (absolute magnitude) and H\u03b1 luminosity. The\nblack symbols are this paper's LSB sample. The red symbols are the combined samples of van\nZee and Hunter & Elmegreen (there was no statisical difference between those two samples).\nThe eight galaxies in common with Hunter & Elmegreen are should as solid symbols (connected\nfor their differing H\u03b1 values). The LSB galaxies are about 0.5 log L(H\u03b1) fainter per stellar mass\nthan the dwarf irregular samples and there is no indication this is due to improper H\u03b1 fluxes.\nevident as the explanation for this shift in the zeropoint. There are numerous possibilities for this\ndifference and we will reserve speculation until our analysis papers.\nThere is a weak correlation between central surface brightness (\u03bcc ) and H\u03b1 luminosity (see\nFigure 11) in the direction of weaker L(H\u03b1) for fainter surface brightnesses. This is not detected in\nother studies (e.g., van Zee 2000); however, it is not unexpected as there are correlations between\nstellar density and HI surface density (de Blok, McGaugh & van der Hulst 1996). This would\nindicate that stellar and gas mass (roughly) follows star formation as evident by H\u03b1 emission,\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\n\nFig. 11.-: Central surface brightness versus H\u03b1 luminosity. There is a weak correlation\nbetween central stellar density and the global H\u03b1 luminosity for LSB galaxies. There are\nnumerous avenues of speculation from an increase number of ionizing UV photons with higher\nstellar density to higher gas surface densities leading to higher star formation rates.\na local version of the Schmidt law (Kennicutt 1998); however, there are numerous avenues of\nspeculation from an increased number of ionizing UV photons with higher stellar density to higher\ngas surface densities leading to higher star formation rates.\nThree examples of the H\u03b1 spatial distribution (D495-2, D570-3, F611-1) are found in Figure\n12 (all the images can be found at the data website). These three examples were selected primarily\nto display a common feature to LSB galaxies, the fact that H\u03b1 emission is frequently uncorrelated\nwith local stellar density. While examples of stellar knots associated with H\u03b1 regions can be found\n(e.g., the brightest HII region in D495-2 corresponds with a stellar knot), typically the HII knots\nare not associated with any stellar enhancement (although there are frequently blue 'bubbles' in\nthe B \u2212 V color maps, see \u00a73.5). These maps should be compared with the H\u03b1 image of UGC 128\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\n(also found at the data website), to fully display the difference H\u03b1 morphology for normal spirals\nand LSB's.\n\n3.4.\n\nTotal Colors\n\nTotal colors (and magnitudes) are extracted using elliptical apertures and asymptotic fits to\nthe apertures as a function of radius (Schombert 2007). Mean colors, quoted in Table 1, are deduced\nfrom the color profiles where a surface brightness average is taken between one scale length (\u03b1) and\nthe RV 25 radius.\nOur sample's distribution of mean B \u2212 V color is shown in Figure 13. Also shown is the\ndistribution of B \u2212 V colors from the RC3 for galaxies with morphological types later than Sc\nplus the combined samples from Hunter & Elmegreen (2006) and van Zee (2001) samples of starforming dwarf irregulars. Our sample has a similar mean and range as the other dwarf galaxy\nsamples (although we are not restricted to solely dwarf sized galaxies). All three dwarf samples are\nbluer than the late-type RC3 sample, probably reflecting the known reddening in these dust rich,\nHSB systems.\nThere is no correlation between surface brightness and color, this has been reported by other\nstudies (McGaugh & de Blok 1997, van Zee 2000). There was also no correlation observed in\nV \u2212 I for the same sample (Pildis, Schombert & Eder 1997). Other studies have larger ranges in\ncentral surface brightness, and it can be seen in Figure 13 that HSB RC3 galaxies are, on average,\nredder than LSB galaxies. Our suspicion here is that a combination of the limited range in surface\nbrightness plus irregular morphology masks any expected global trends with respect to color.\nIn addition to B \u2212 V colors, 23 galaxies in our sample were also imaged in the I band (Pildis,\nSchombert & Eder 1997). The B \u2212V versus V \u2212I color plane is shown in Figure 14 along with BV I\ndata from the RC3. While our LSB sample clearly occupies the bluest portion of the BV I plane,\nit is also very much an extension of the color trend outlined by the RC3 galaxies and overlaps with\nthe bluest galaxies in the RC3 sample. While there is some tendency for LSB galaxies to be bluer\nin V \u2212 I compared to the RC3 trend, the mean values are equal between the RC3 and our sample.\nAlso shown in Figure 14 are two stellar population models tracks (instantaneous burst followed\nby passive evolution), one for a 13 Gyrs composite stellar population (with a standard chemical\nevolutionary scenario applied, see Schombert & Rakos 2009) and a 1 Gyr population ([Fe/H] varies\nfrom the red to the blue tip by +0.4 to -2.0). While this is a simplistic comparison for galaxies\nwhich clearly have some (although very little) current star formation, it does place LSB galaxies in\nthe context of galaxy evolution.\nThe reddest RC3 galaxies are well explained by an old stellar population that ranges in metallicity (Schombert & Rakos 2009). Given that the mean metallicity of LSB galaxies is about [Fe/H]\n= -1.0 (McGaugh 1991), there is no old stellar population that fits their B \u2212 V versus V \u2212 I colors.\n\n\f\u2013 20 \u2013\n\nFig. 12.-: Three examples of H\u03b1 maps compared to V images (V on the left, H\u03b1 on the\nright). While on occasion HII regions are seen in the V images (e.g., the brightest knot in\nD495-2), in most cases the H\u03b1 emission is not visible in the optical images.\n\nThis indicates that there must be a significant younger population in LSB galaxies, despite their low\nstellar density appearance. This, of course, is the core of the LSB dilemma, recent star formation\nto achieve blue optical colors without large numbers of bright OB stars to increase its luminosity\ndensity. We will explore a larger range of star formation models in a later paper.\n\n\f\u2013 21 \u2013\n\nFig. 13.-: Normalized histograms of B \u2212V color. This sample is in black, the RC3 late-type\ngalaxies are in green, Hunter & Elmegreen and van Zee dwarf galaxies are in red. Our sample\nhas a similar mean and range as the dwarf galaxy sample, both are significantly bluer than the\nRC3 sample.\n3.5.\n\nB \u2212 V Color Maps\n\nDeep B and V imaging allows, for the first time, a pixel-to-pixel examination of the color\ndistribution in LSB galaxies. Three examples of this type of color map is seen in the left panel of\nFigure 15, their H\u03b1 emission is shown in right panel. There is no obvious correlation between color\nand H\u03b1 emission for these three galaxies. However, this should not be too surprising as there is\nlittle evidence for H\u03b1 emission in the V images (the H\u03b1 emission is not visible in stellar luminosity\ndensity).\nWe also note there are several notable exceptions to the lack of color-H\u03b1 correlation. For\nexample, there is a clear blue ridge in the color map of D564-9 that corresponds to a linear H\u03b1\nfeature (we note that D564-9 is one of the most active star-forming galaxies in this sample). In\naddition, there are blue 'star bubble' features associated with HII regions in galaxies D631-7,\nD646-5 and D646-7. Here the blue colors are spatially correlated with the diffuse emission around\na HII region, rather than the core of the H\u03b1 emission itself. This might reflect the evolutionary\ndevelopment of the stellar complex or it might indicate that the stellar cores are obscured by dust\n(although LSB galaxies are not prolific far-IR sources, Schombert & Bothun 1988 and seem to\ncontain very little dust O'Neil et al. 1998). These color features will be explored in a later paper.\n\n\f\u2013 22 \u2013\n\nFig. 14.-: BV I color plane for the subsample of LSB galaxies with B \u2212 V and V \u2212 I colors\n(black symbols). RC3 galaxies are shown as green symbols. Also shown are 13 Gyrs stellar\npopulation tracks (instantaneous burst followed by passive evolution) for a range of metallicities\n(red) and a 1 Gyr stellar population (blue). Given that the mean metallicity of LSB galaxies is\nabout [Fe/H] = -1.0 (McGaugh 1991), there is no old stellar population that fits their B \u2212 V\nversus V \u2212 I colors. Therefore, all indicators are that there must be a significant younger\npopulation in LSB galaxies, despite their low stellar density appearance.\nThis dataset is also sufficiently high in S/N to allow us to compare the color of individual pixels\nwith the pixel's surface brightness. This is accomplished by assigning to each pixel a mean B \u2212 V\ncolor and a surface brightness, based on its calibrated V flux divided by pixel area. This plot, using\n280,000 pixels above 25 V mag arcsecs\u22122 , is shown in top panel of Figure 16. Each color-\u03bc data\npoint is treated as a 2D gaussian with a standard deviation tied to the color and surface brightness\nerror of the pixel. All the pixels are summed and binned to produce the density diagrams in Figure\n16.\nThe bottom panel displays the same colors for but only for pixels with detectable H\u03b1 emission.\n\n\f\u2013 23 \u2013\n\nFig. 15.-: Three LSB galaxies viewed for their H\u03b1 emission (left panel) and their B \u2212 V\ncolor maps (right panel, B \u2212 V = 0.0 is blue, B \u2212 V = 1.0 is red). There are no prominent\ncorrelates with spatial color and H\u03b1 emission.\nNote that the brightest pixels (above 23.5 mag arcsecs\u22122 ) are the bluest pixels in either plot. H\u03b1\npixels can occur in regions of high and low surface brightness, with the same distribution of color\nas other pixels. And, while H\u03b1 pixels are associated with some high surface brightness areas, the\nreverse is not true and, therefore, it is difficult to isolate star formation regions just from V band\nimages as noted above.\nThe increasing spread of color with fainter surface brightness is reflecting increasing error at\nlow S/N levels. Even with this spread there is a weak correlation between pixel color and surface\nbrightness such that the brightest pixels are the bluest. While this is not surprising, and also true\nof normal spirals, it does, at least, tie star formation in LSB galaxies as a similar process to that in\n\n\f\u2013 24 \u2013\nnormal spirals (i.e. the bluest regions are associated with bright, high mass stars, not just lowest\nmetallicities).\nThe same analysis can be performed on the V \u2212 I color images for a subsample of galaxies with\nBV I photometry. The two color pixel diagram is shown in Figure 17. The only clear difference\nbetween the pixel colors and the global galaxy colors in Figure 14 is a distinct tail of bluer V \u2212 I\ncolors at B \u2212V = 0.6. These are fainter surface brightness pixels, but their origin is unclear as none\nof the simpler stellar population models occupy this portion of the BV I plane for any combination\nof age and metallicity. We will discuss this problem in a later paper.\n\n4.\n\nSummary\n\nWe present optical and H\u03b1 imaging for a sample of 61 LSB galaxies selected from the PSS-II\nLSB catalog (Schombert et al. 1992). Combined with previous HI measurements, this provides\ndata for a comprehensive study of the gas fraction, current star formation rates, stellar population\ncharacteristics and mode of star formation. This paper presents only the core data. Analysis\non the meaning of the data will be offered in the later papers of this series. A summary of the\ncharacteristics of the dataset are:\n(1) The sample of LSB galaxies selected for our study was based on their morphology and redshift\n(less than 8,000 km/sec for the H\u03b1 filter set). No selection was made on luminosity, size\nor dynamical mass. The sample covers a range of galaxy characteristics that overlap with\nmagnitude selected samples (e.g., RC3) and dwarf galaxy samples (van Zee 2000).\n(2) Data analysis attempts to present the sample in both a visual way (see Figure 1) and using\nan XML data format that allows the user to follow the calibration and reduction process.\n(3) Total magnitudes and colors are extracted using asymptotic fits and surface brightness averaged\ncolor isophotes. The resulting values are in agreement, within the errors, with galaxies in\ncommon from the Hunter & Elmegreen (2004) sample of dwarf irregulars.\n(4) Central surface brightness and isophotal size are extracted from surface brightness profiles\nof each galaxy (\u03bcc and RV 25 ). Exponential fits are adequate for about 80% of the sample,\nproviding disk scale length (\u03b1 and central surface brightness (\u03bco ).\n(5) H\u03b1 luminosities are extracted by grid photometry. Comparison to aperture values indicates\nthat a 40% correction to account for diffuse emission is required (in agreement with van Zee\n2000). Resulting L(H\u03b1) values are in agreement, within the errors, with Hunter & Elmegreen.\nOur sample has a mean H\u03b1 luminosity about a factor of 10 lower than other dwarf or gas-rich\ngalaxy studies (e.g. van Zee 2000).\n(6) H\u03b1 maps confirm the sporadic nature of star formation in LSB galaxies. The HII regions are\nneither coherent to themselves (i.e. a density wave) or any optical features in the galaxy.\n\n\f\u2013 25 \u2013\nThe only correlation between a global property of an LSB and its star formation rate is total\nstellar mass and L(H\u03b1).\n(7) LSB color distributions in B \u2212 V and V \u2212 I are similar to dwarf irregular samples, but about\n0.1 bluer in B \u2212 V than late-type spirals. Two color diagrams place LSB galaxies at the\nextreme blue end of the color distribution of all galaxy types.\n(8) Color maps display little correlation between color and H\u03b1 emission. However, several color\nfeatures are found to associate with some HII regions (e.g. blue shells). Color gradients vary\nin direction and magnitude for the sample.\nIn general, this dataset presents an overall picture of LSB galaxies where they have some\ncharacteristics in common with dwarf galaxies and gas-rich irregulars, yet differ in significant ways\nthat may provide the clue to their LSB nature. They cover a range of sizes and luminosities beyond\nthe definition of dwarf galaxies, yet have SFR's lower than galaxies of the comparable luminosity\n(i.e. stellar mass). In the later papers of this series, we will present an analysis of the complete\ndataset with the goal of outlining possible star formation histories for LSB galaxies.\nWe gratefully acknowledge KPNO/NOAO for the telescope time to complete this project.\nSoftware for this project was developed under NASA's AIRS and ADP Programs.\n\nREFERENCES\nAdami, C., et al. 2006, A&A, 459, 679\nde Blok, W.
