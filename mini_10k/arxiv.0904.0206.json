Data for different densities \u03c6 can be\ncollapsed onto two master curves by scaling \u03be(t) and t by powers of |\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6J |, indicative of critical\nscaling. Furthermore, particle transport for \u03c6 > \u03c6J exhibits aging and superdiffusion similar to a\nrange of soft matter experiments, suggesting a common origin. Finally, we explain how \u03be(t) at late\ntimes maps onto known behavior away from \u03c6J .\nPACS numbers: 45.70.-n, 64.60.-i, 05.70.Jk\n\nDiscontinuous phases such as granular media, foams\nand emulsions often exhibit a jamming transition from a\nfluid to an amorphous solid as the volume fraction is increased [1]. This transition is characterised by the onset\nof elastic response, deriving from the deformation of particles or droplets within a system\u2013spanning contact network that inevitably arises when excluded volume constraints cannot be satisfied. Numerical studies of model\nathermal systems have revealed similarities to continuous\nphase transitions: Static quantities such as elastic moduli vanish algebraically as the jamming volume fraction\n\u03c6J is approached from above [2], accompanied by diverging length scales in the linear response [3]. Furthermore,\nnon\u2013linear rheology under continuous shear has revealed\na diverging viscosity as \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c6\u2212\nJ , preconfiguring a finite\nyield stress above \u03c6J [4, 5, 6]. The flow curves can be\nmade to collapse onto two master curves, one for above\nthe transition and one below, when the stress and strain\nrates are scaled by powers of |\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6J | [4, 5], analogous to\ncritical scaling functions [7].\nHowever, these static or driven systems mask the relaxation mechanisms by which packings reduce unbalanced\nforces, preventing comparison with the rich phenomenology of relaxation in non\u2013equilibrium systems. The noted\nsimilarities with criticality suggest we look there first:\nSystems quenched to their critical temperature attain local equilibrium on wavelengths shorter than a correlation length \u03be(t) that grows algebraically with time [8].\nThis growing length is at the root of the aging of correlation and response functions, which include factors of\nthe form g[\u03be(tw + t)/\u03be(tw )] for a time tw since quench\nand a lag time t. After suitable normalization the functions g(x) are universal, belonging to a small number of\ndynamic universality classes. Aging is also present in\n(non\u2013critical) glassy systems, but \u03be(t) is either implicit\nor has a different physical interpretation such as domain\nsize [9]. It is not known if any of this phenomenology\ncarries over to athermal systems at or near \u03c6J .\nHere we numerically investigate non\u2013linear relaxation\n\nin freely\u2013cooling soft sphere systems for a range of \u03c6\nspanning \u03c6J . We find evidence for a growing length scale\n\u03be(t) corresponding to the relaxation towards mechanical\nequilibrium, i.e. force balance. In analogy with critical\nscaling, \u03be(t) for different \u03c6 can be collapsed onto \u03c6 < \u03c6J\nand \u03c6 > \u03c6J master curves by scaling \u03be and t by suitable\npowers of |\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6J |. From this scaling we also infer an\nunjamming time that diverges as \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c6\u2212\nJ . For \u03c6 > \u03c6J ,\n\u03be(t) \u223c t for all t attributable to elastic propagation, and\nthe particle transport properties obey aging similar to experiments on a range of soft\u2013matter systems [10, 11, 12],\nsuggesting a common origin. Finally, for late times we\nshow how \u03be(t) maps onto known behavior away from \u03c6J .\nModel.-We consider viscous soft discs in a square simulation cell of dimensions L \u00d7 L with periodic boundary conditions. To reduce ordering effects, the particle diameters d are uniformly distributed over the range\n[0.7hdi, 1.3hdi] with hdi the mean. Particles have equal\nmass density. Overlapping particles \u03b1 and \u03b2 with centers separated by a distance R\u03b1\u03b2 < 21 (d\u03b1 + d\u03b2 ) interact in two ways: (i) A linear repulsive force f el =\n\u03bc[1 \u2212 2R\u03b1\u03b2 /(d\u03b1 + d\u03b2 )] acting along the line of centers,\nand (ii) a viscous damping f vis = \u03b7(v\u03b1 \u2212 v\u03b2 ) which acts\nto reduce the relative velocity between \u03b1 and \u03b2. Particles making no contacts move ballistically. Note that for\nsimplicity there is no distinction between tangential and\nnormal velocities in the damping term.\nA structureless initial configuration is constructed by\ndepositing particles uniformly over the simulation\ncell to\nP\ngive the required area fraction \u03c6 = L\u22122 \u03b1 \u03c0(d\u03b1 /2)2 .\nEach velocity is initially zero, so the initial energy reservoir is provided by overlapping particles and varies as \u03c62 .\nThis variation with \u03c6 is weak compared to the much more\nrapidly varying quantities discussed below, so no crucial dependence on the choice of initial conditions is expected. Particles were iterated using the velocity Verlet\nalgorithm which includes particle inertia [13]. The simulations were continued until the pressure either changed\nby less than one part in 105 over a time interval corre-\n\n\f2\nthe cluster coarsening regime to be discussed later.\nFor all \u03c6 a local minimum\u2013local maximum pairing\nemerges at short times and moves to lower q as the system\nevolves, approximately as \u223c t\u22121 for small t. This structural signature of a linearly growing length is also evident\nin a dynamic length extracted from the same\u2013time\nvelocP\nity correlations Cvv (r = |x\u03b1 \u2212 x\u03b2 |, t) = N h \u03b1,\u03b2 v(x\u03b1 , t)*\nv(x\u03b2 , t)i, normalized so that Cvv (0, t) \u2261 1. Following\nOlsson and Teitel [4] we identify the characteristic velocity correlation length \u03bev (t) with the global minimum of\nCvv . The growth of \u03bev (t) for different \u03c6, and examples\nof Cvv , are given in insets to Fig. 2.\nThe data for all \u03c6 can be collapsed onto two master curves by scaling \u03bev (t) by |\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6J |\u2212\u03bd and t by\n|\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6J |\u2212\u01eb , with \u03bd = 0.57 \u00b1 0.05, \u01eb = 0.6 \u00b1 0.05 and\n\u03c6J = 0.843 \u00b1 0.001, as demonstrated in Fig. 2. Note that\nwe also scale t by a non\u2013critical factor \u03c61/2 to improve\ncollapse at small times, in the spirit of corrections to scaling [7], but this does not alter the exponents. The exponent \u03bd is consistent with that already found for steady\nflow [4], but as for that protocol, we cannot achieve reasonable collapse using the exponent \u2248 0.5 for the diverging length in linear response [3], and conclude these two\nlengths are unrelated. Indeed, for all \u03c6 > \u03c6J , \u03bev (t) \u221d t\nand hence diverges with time, whereas the linear response\nlengths only diverge for \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c6+\nJ .

For short times \u03bev (t) \u221d t\nfor all \u03c6, which, since there is no ballistic transport of\nparticles (see below), must be due to elastic propagation\nthrough multi\u2013particle contact networks. Inverting the\naxes scaling gives a speed of sound c \u221d |\u03c6\u2212\u03c6J |\u01eb\u2212\u03bd , which\nis finite at \u03c6J when \u01eb \u2261 \u03bd, which is within error bars.\nBelow \u03c6J , \u03bev (t) also initially grows linearly before saturating at a finite value, at which point the data collapse\nfails and cluster coarsening (which is not controlled by\n\u03c6J ) begins. The allows us to define an 'unjamming' time\nwhen the plateau is reached, which by reversing the axes\nscaling is seen to diverge as \u223c (\u03c6J \u2212 \u03c6)\u2212\u01eb .\nAging.- If \u03be(t) controls the relaxation as claimed, the\nmean\u2013squared\ndisplacement (MSD) \u2206r2 (tw + t, tw ) =\nP\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n2\n\u22121\nN\n\u03b1 |x (tw + t) \u2212 x (tw )| should be a function of\n\u03be(tw + t)/\u03be(tw ) [9]. For \u03c6 > \u03c6J , \u03be(t) \u221d t so we expect\n\n\u2206r2 (tw + t, tw ) \u223c g(t/tw ) corresponding to full aging.\nConversely, \u03be(t) approaches a \u03c6\u2013dependent constant for\n\u03c6 < \u03c6J and critical aging should cease (although some\nother form of aging may recur deep in the cluster coarsening regime). Examples of \u2206r2 (tw + t, tw ) above and\nbelow \u03c6J are given in Fig. 4. For \u03c6 > \u03c6J the MSD takes\na fixed form which systematically scales to lower amplitudes and later times with increasing tw . By contrast,\nfor \u03c6 < \u03c6J no such systematic scaling is apparent over\nthe available time window.\nAging has been experimentally observed in a range of\nrelaxing soft\u2013matter systems [10, 11, 12], and we speculate that the underlying mechanism may be the same as\nin this athermal system. To test this we must first quantify the observed tw \u2013scaling for \u03c6 > \u03c6J . We first smooth\nthe data by fitting each tw \u2013curve to the 3\u2013parameter fit\nM (tw )/{1 + [t/\u03c4 (tw )]\u2212a }, as shown in Fig. 4(b). M (tw )\ndescribes the variation in the overall amplitude of particle transport with tw , \u03c4 (tw ) is a relaxation time, and\na is the early\u2013time growth exponent. For large tw both\nM (tw ) and \u03c4 (tw ) are expected to scale algebraically with\ntw , so we fit each to the form A(1 + tw /B)bM ,b\u03c4 resp., to\nextract bM and b\u03c4 . The exponents a, bM and b\u03c4 for each\n\u03c6 are plotted in Fig. 5(a). Since there is little apparent\nvariation with \u03c6, we can improve the statistics by averaging over all \u03c6, giving a = 1.51 \u00b1 0.01, bM = \u22120.98 \u00b1 0.02\nand b\u03c4 = 0.84 \u00b1 0.05. This latter value would appear to\nsuggest subaging rather than the full aging b\u03c4 \u2261 1 expected for a critical point [8], but we cannot yet rule out\nsystematic errors due to the chosen fitting functions.\nIt is now possible to compare these findings to the\nequivalent quantities measured in the experiments [10,\n11, 12]. We find three areas of agreement: (i) Superdiffusive particle transport \u2206r2 \u223c ta with a \u2248 1.5, as inferred from the speckle decay in experiments [10] and\ndirectly measured here [for t \u226a \u03c4 (tw )]; (ii) Aging, with\nexperimental b\u03c4 in the range 0.77 to 1.8, compared to\nb\u03c4 \u2248 0.84 here, and (iii) Convective decay of the scattering vector, which has been interpreted as evidence for\nthe ballistic motion of elastic strain deformations through\nthe material [11, 14]. Elastic waves are also present in\nour system, and while we do not refute this interpretation of the data, it is interesting to note that we observe\na linearly\u2013growing length in this model, namely the correlation length \u03be(t) \u223c t detailed above. We hypothesise\nthat this may be the true origin of the experimentally\u2013\nobserved ballistic growth law. In this context, closer comparison with experimental data would be desirable.\nLate times.- For \u03c6 > \u03c6J , \u03be(t) becomes arbitrarily\nlarge and the system reaches global mechanical equilibrium. The scaling properties of these static systems have\nbeen studied by non\u2013inertial algorithms [2, 3]. For comparison, in Table I we give the corresponding quantities\nfor states generated by our inertial algorithm. The agreement with previous results confirms the robustness of the\nstatic state to the preparation procedure. As our density\n\n\f4\nsubsequent evolution is described by granular gas theory.\n\nFIG. 4: (Color online) Mean squared displacement \u2206r 2 (tw +\nt, tw ) for single runs at (a) \u03c6 = 0.8 < \u03c6J and (b) \u03c6 = 0.88 >\n\u03c6J . In both cases, lines from top to bottom correspond to\ngeometrically increasing tw in the range 0.4 < tw /t0 < 40. In\n(b) the smooth green lines are smoothing fits (see text).\n\nConclusions.- The relaxation of freely cooling athermal systems considered here support the view that the\nmodel 'point\u2013J' jamming transition is closer in nature\nto a continuous phase transition than a glass transition:\nWhile aging is common to both, the critical scaling of\n\u03be(t) in Fig. 2, controlled by a single point \u03c6J , is expected\nonly for critical points. The correspondence is of course\nnot complete, and as for continuous shear [5] we expect\nthe master curves to depend on the interaction potential.\nNonetheless we believe a fundamental understanding of\nthis important transition will best approached from the\nstandpoint of critical point theory, and further modelling\nin this direction would be desirable.\nAcknowledgements.- The author would like to acknowledge H. Tanaka for useful discussions.\n\nFIG. 5: (Color online) (a) Transport and aging exponents versus density. Smooth lines are the average over all \u03c6.

The velocity correlation\nlength \u03bev is also shown, and is similar to \u03bec where their\ntime windows overlap, demonstrating that \u03be(t) tracks\ncluster growth after unjamming.
