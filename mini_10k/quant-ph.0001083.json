One protocol uses four mutually unbiased bases\nand appears to provide better security than obtainable with 2-state carriers.\nAnother possible method allows quantum states to belong to more than one\nbasis. The security is not better, but many curious features arise.\nPACS numbers: 03.67.-a, 03.67.Dd, 03.65.Bz\n\nTypeset using REVTEX\n1\n\n\fWhen Samuel Morse invented the telegraph, he devised for it an alphabet consisting\nof three symbols: dash, dot, and space. More modern communication methods use binary\nsignals, conventionally called 0 and 1. Information theory, whose initial goal was to improve\ncommunication efficiency, naturally introduced binary digits (bits) as its accounting units.\nHowever, the theory can easily be reformulated in terms of ternary digits (trits) 0, 1, 2, or\nlarger sets of symbols [1]. For example, instead of bytes (sets of 8 bits) representing 256\nordinary characters, we would have \"trytes\" (5 trits) for 243 characters. An ordinary text\nwould thus be encoded into a string of trits. If we wish to encrypt the latter, this can be\ndone by adding to it (modulo 3) a random string, called key, known only to legitimate users.\nDecrypting is then performed by subtracting that key (modulo 3).\nThe aim of quantum cryptography [2] is to generate a secret key by using quantum\ncarriers for the initial communication between distant parties (conventionally called Alice\nand Bob). The simplest methods use 2-state systems, such as polarized photons. Orthogonal\nstates represent bit values 0 and 1. One may use either two [2] or three [3,4] orthogonal\nbases, chosen in such a way that any basis vectors |ej i and |e\u03bc i belonging to different bases\nsatisfy |hej , e\u03bc i|2 = 1/2. Such bases are called mutually unbiased [5,6]. As a consequence,\nif an eavesdropper (Eve) uses the wrong basis, she gets no information at all and causes\nmaximal disturbance (error rate 1/2) to the transmission, thereby revealing her presence.\nIn this Letter, we consider 3-state systems as the quantum carriers for cryptographic\nkey distribution. For example, one may use \"biphotons\" [7], namely photon pairs in symmetric Fock states |0, 2i, |2, 0i, and |1, 1i. Biphotons can easily be produced with present\ntechnology, and detecting arbitrary linear combinations of them will probably be possible\nsoon. (Another possibility would be to use four states of a pair of photons [8], but here we\nconsider only 3-state systems.)\nFollowing the method of refs. [3,4], we introduce four mutually unbiased bases. Let |\u03b1i,\n|\u03b2i, and |\u03b3i be the unit vectors of one of the bases. Another basis is obtained by a discrete\nFourier transform,\n\n2\n\n\f\u221a\n|\u03b1\u2032i = (|\u03b1i + |\u03b2i + |\u03b3i)/ 3,\n\n\u221a\n|\u03b2 \u2032i = (|\u03b1i + e2\u03c0i/3 |\u03b2i + e\u22122\u03c0i/3 |\u03b3i)/ 3,\n\u221a\n|\u03b3 \u2032 i = (|\u03b1i + e\u22122\u03c0i/3 |\u03b2i + e2\u03c0i/3 |\u03b3i)/ 3.\n\n(1)\n\nThe two other bases can be taken as\n\u221a\n(e2\u03c0i/3 |\u03b1i + |\u03b2i + |\u03b3i)/ 3\n\nand cyclic perm.,\n\n(2)\n\n\u221a\n(e\u22122\u03c0i/3 |\u03b1i + |\u03b2i + |\u03b3i)/ 3\n\nand cyclic perm..\n\n(3)\n\nand\n\nAny basis vectors |ej i and |e\u03bc i belonging to different bases now satisfy |hej , e\u03bc i|2 = 1/3.\nThe protocol for establishing a secret key is the usual one. Alice randomly chooses one\nof the 12 vectors and sends to Bob a signal whose quantum state is represented by that\nvector. Bob randomly chooses one of the four bases and \"measures\" the signal (that is,\nBob tests whether the signal is one of the basis vectors). Having done that, Bob publicly\nreveals which basis he chose, but not the result he obtained. Alice then reveals whether her\nvector belongs to that basis. If it does, Alice and Bob share the knowledge of one trit. If\nit does not, that transmission was useless. This procedure is repeated until Alice and Bob\nhave obtained a long enough key. They will then have to sacrifice some of the trits for error\ncorrection and privacy amplification [9] (we shall not discuss these points, which are the\nsame as in all cryptographic protocols, except that we have to use trits instead of bits, and\ntherefore parity checks become triality checks, that is, sums modulo 3).\nConsider the simplest eavesdropping strategy: Eve intercepts a particle, measures it,\nand resends to Bob the state that she found. In 3/4 of the cases, she uses a wrong basis,\ngets no information, and causes maximal disturbance to the transmission: Bob's error rate\n(that is, the probability of a wrong identification of the trit value) is 2/3. On the average,\nover all transmissions, Eve gets IE = 1/4 of a trit and Bob's error rate is EB = 1/2. (It\nis natural to measure Eve's information in trits, since Bob gets one trit for each successful\ntransmission.) These results may be compared to those obtained by using 2-state systems.\n3\n\n\fWith only two bases as in ref. [2] and with the same simple eavesdropping strategy, Eve\nlearns on the average 1/2 of a bit for each transmitted bit, and Bob's error rate is 1/4. If we\nuse three bases as in [3,4], these numbers become 1/3. Thus, with the present method, Eve\nlearns a smaller fraction of the information and causes a larger disturbance. It is likely that\nthis is also true in presence of more sophisticated eavesdropping strategies, such as using an\nancilla to gently probe the transmission without completely disrupting it. When people seek\nEve's \"optimal\" eavesdropping strategy [10], their criterion usually is the maximal value of\nIE /EB .\nDo the above results mean that using 3-state systems improves the cryptographic security? The answer depends on which aim we seek to achieve. If Alice and Bob simply wish\nto be warned that an eavesdropper is active, and in that case they will use another communication channel, then obviously the highest possible ratio EB /IE is desirable. Eve can at\nmost conceal her presence by intercepting only a small fraction x of the transmissions, such\nthat xEB is less than the natural error rate, but then IE is reduced by the same factor, and\nEve's illicit information can be eliminated by classical privacy amplification [9].\nHowever it may be that Alice and Bob have no alternative channel to use and privacy\namplification is their only possibility of fighting the eavesdropper. In that case, it is known\n[11,12] that secure communication can in principle be achieved if Bob's mutual information\nwith Alice, IB , is larger than Eve's IE . Note that even if Bob and Eve have the same error\nrate, as in one of the above examples, IE > IB . The reason is that Eve knows whether Alice\nand Bob used the same basis, and therefore which ones of her data are correct and which\nones are worthless. On the other hand, Bob can only compare with Alice a subset of data,\nso as to measure his mean error rate EB , and from the latter deduce the Shannon entropy\nof his string. For 2-state systems, assuming all bit values equally probable, he obtains\nIB = 1 + (1 \u2212 EB ) log2 (1 \u2212 EB ) + EB log2 EB ,\n\n(4)\n\nand likewise for 3-state systems,\nIB = 1 + (1 \u2212 EB ) log3 (1 \u2212 EB ) + EB log3 (EB /2).\n4\n\n(5)\n\n\fNumerical results, in bits and trits respectively, will be given in Table II at the end of this\nLetter, together with those for two other cryptographic protocols, discussed below.\nNew types of cryptographic protocols may indeed be devised if the Hilbert space has\nmore than two dimensions. The reason is that a basis vector may now belong to several\nbases. In that case, it is natural to assume that each vector represents a definite trit (0, 1, or\n2), which is the same in all the bases to which that vector belongs [13]. An example is given\nin the table below, where vectors are labelled green, red, and blue, for later convenience.\nTABLE I. Components of 21 unnormalized vectors. The symbols 1\u0304 and 2\u0304\nstand for \u22121 and \u22122, respectively.

In the present case, the tricolor analogue of the Kochen-Specker theorem requires\nonly 13 rays for its proof, because ray (111) is orthogonal to all the rays in the third column,\nwhich have three different colors. These 12 vectors form 13 bases, but only four bases are\ncomplete. The nine others bases have only two vectors each and have to be completed by\nnine new vectors, listed in the last three columns of the table. To display these nine vectors\non Fig. 1, their integer components should be divided by 2. The corresponding dots are then\nlocated at the centers of various squares on the faces of the cube.\nThe cryptographic protocol is the same as before, but now Alice has 21 vectors to choose\nfrom, and Bob has a choice of 13 bases. The essential difference is that these bases are\nnot mutually unbiased, so that if Eve chooses a different basis (which happens 12/13 of the\n5\n\n\ftime), she still gets at least probabilistic information on Alice's vector. It may also happen\nthat Eve's basis is different from Bob's, but both bases contain the vector found by Eve. In\nthat case, when Bob announces his basis and Alice confirms it, Eve can infer that she got\nthe correct state and caused no error.\nLet us analyze what happens for each successful transmission, that is, when Alice's vector\n|ej i is one of those in the basis announced by Bob. Suppose that in her eavesdropping\nattempt, Eve obtains a state |e\u03bc i. This happens with probability P\u03bcj = |hej , e\u03bc i|2. This is\nalso the probability that Bob gets the correct |ej i when Eve resends to him |e\u03bc i. On the\naverage over all Alice's |ej i and all Eve's choices of a basis, the probability that Bob gets a\ncorrect result is\nC=\n\n21 X\n21\nX\nj=1 \u03bc=1\n\nM\u03bc (P\u03bcj )2 /(21 \u00d7 13),\n\n(6)\n\nwhere M\u03bc is the number of bases to which |e\u03bc i belongs (namely M\u03bc = 2 for the vectors in\nthe first and third columns of Table I, M\u03bc = 3 for those of the second and fourth columns,\nand M\u03bc = 1 for the rest). Bob's mean error probability is EB = 1 \u2212 C = 0.385022.\nTo evaluate Eve's gain of information IE , we note that when Alice confirms the basis\nchosen by Bob, Eve is left with a choice of three vectors having equal prior probabilities,\npj = 1/3. The initial Shannon entropy is Hi = 1 trit, and the prior probability for Eve's\nresult \u03bc is\nq\u03bc =\n\n2\nX\n\nP\u03bcj pj = 1/3.\n\n(7)\n\nj=0\n\nIt then follows from Bayes's theorem that the likelihood (posterior probability) of signal j\nis (see ref.

The IRE results are also listed\nin Table II. However, it is interesting that in this case, Eve can get some information without performing any active eavesdropping and without causing any error, just by passively\nlistening and waiting for Alice to confirm Bob's choice of an incomplete basis. Eve then\nlearns that one of the three trit values is eliminated. On the average, she gets information\nIE = (9/13) (1 + log3 2) = 0.255510 trit.\n\n(12)\n\nFinally, let us investigate what happens if Eve eavesdrops only on a fraction x of the\nparticles sent by Alice. In that case, both IE and EB are multiplied by x, and IB is still\n7\n\n\fgiven by Eqs. (4) and (5), with EB replaced by xEB on the right hand side. The results are\ndisplayed in Fig. 2, which also shows the security domain IB \u2265 IE , assuming standard error\ncorrection and privacy amplification [9]. The values of x for which IB = IE are listed in\nthe last column of Table II. We see that the use of four mutually unbiased bases for 3-state\nparticles requires the highest value of x to breach the security. Moreover, for any given value\nof IB , this protocol is the one that gives the lowest value of IE . It thus appears that this\nmethod is the one giving the best results against IRE attacks. It is likely to also be the best\nfor more sophisticated eavesdropping strategies, but this problem lies beyond the scope of\nthe present Letter.\nWe thank Nicolas Gisin for helpful comments on cryptographic security, and Daniel Terno\nfor bringing ref.
