These bursts were first observed by Grindlay et al. (1976), and have\nbeen studied intensively for many years (see van Paradijs et al. 1988; Lewin et al. 1993;\nStrohmayer et al. 1998; Cornelisse et al. 2003, for summaries of the observations). Recently,\nthere has been renewed excitement in the field, following the discovery of high frequency\noscillations in burst light curves (e.g., Strohmayer et al. 1996; Strohmayer 2001a; van Straaten\net al. 2001; Muno et al. 2001).\nThe physics of Type I bursts has been widely studied, and the broad features of the\nphenomenon are understood theoretically (Woosley & Taam 1976; Joss 1977; Taam & Picklum 1978; Paczynski 1983a; Fujimoto et al. 1981; Fushiki & Lamb 1987a; Taam et al. 1996;\nBildsten 1998). Models show that there are three kinds of bursts, depending on whether\nhydrogen or helium burning dominates. At high mass accretion rates \u1e40, hydrogen is only\npartially burned before a burst is triggered by unstable helium burning. The result is a mixed\nburst in which both hydrogen and helium burn explosively. At somewhat lower values of \u1e40 ,\nall the hydrogen is consumed before the helium instability is triggered. This leads to a pure\nhelium burst. For yet lower \u1e40 , hydrogen itself burns unstably, giving a hydrogen burst. The\nranges of \u1e40 corresponding to the different regimes have been worked out approximately.\nTwo very different approaches have been pursued for theoretically modeling the burst\nphenomenon. In one approach, one simulates the physics of the accreting gas with a fully\ntime-dependent code that includes a large network of nuclear reactions and sophisticated\nthermodynamics (e.g., Joss 1978; Taam & Picklum 1979; Joss & Li 1980; Taam 1982; Fujimoto et al. 1987b; Taam et al. 1993). Such studies are essential for understanding the\ndetails of the thermonuclear explosion; indeed, the one-dimensional simulations of the past\nhave now been generalized to two-dimensional and even three-dimensional simulations (the\nFLASH effort at Chicago, Zingale et al. 2001) which follow the physics of bursts in exquisite\ndetail. Such simulations are, however, not very convenient for parameter surveys or for\ndetailed comparisons of theoretical predictions with observational burst statistics.\nAn alternate approach, where one focuses on the thermonuclear instability that triggers\nthe burst rather than on the burst itself, has been popular (e.g., Hansen & van Horn 1975;\nErgma & Tutukov 1980; Fujimoto et al. 1981; Taam 1982; Paczynski 1983a; Fushiki & Lamb\n1987a; Fujimoto et al. 1987a; Cumming & Bildsten 2000). Here one treats the accumulating\nlayer of gas on the surface of the neutron star as a quasi-equilibrium system whose properties\nvary slowly with time. One first solves for the equilibrium structure and then analyses the\nstability of the gas layer by considering the effect of small perturbations on the underlying\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nequilibrium. If the perturbations grow with time, one says that the system is unstable,\npresumably resulting in a Type 1 X-ray burst.\nThe second approach, though not as general as the first, allows one to explore a large\nrange of parameter space and to study how the burst phenomenon is affected by variations\nin control parameters such as the mass accretion rate, the surface gravity of the star, etc.\nHowever, the analyses that have been published so far in the literature employ fairly simpleminded criteria to decide exactly when an accreted layer becomes unstable and are, therefore,\nnot very accurate or complete. The motivation of the present paper is to develop a more\nrigorous stability analysis for accreting neutron stars. Our hope is (i) to verify the results of\nthe earlier methods, (ii) to explore additional phenomena that may have been missed previously, and (iii) to put the theory on a rigorous footing to enable quantitative comparisons\nwith observations. We reported some early results of this work in Narayan & Heyl (2002).\nWe begin the paper in \u00a72 with a description of our model of the accreted layer and\nthe method we employ to calculate equilibria and to study their stability. We follow this\nin \u00a73 with an exploration of sequences of equilibria, and in \u00a74 with a discussion of the\nstability properties of the equilibria. Through this analysis, we reproduce the three previously\nrecognized regimes of burst activity, namely mixed bursts, helium bursts, and hydrogen\nbursts. However, we find that mixed bursts themselves come in two kinds: prompt mixed\nbursts and delayed mixed bursts. The latter category has not been recognized previously. In\n\u00a75 we present results for neutron stars of various radii and core temperatures, and explore\na wide range of mass accretion rates. We calculate a number of burst observables such\nas the recurrence time, the burst duration, and the dimensionless parameter \u03b1 (Eq. 35)\nwhich is widely used in the burst literature. In \u00a76, we compare our theoretical formalism\nto methods previously published in the literature. We also compare our predictions with\nselected observations. From the latter, we obtain preliminary results on the likely core\ntemperatures and radii of bursting neutron stars. We conclude in \u00a77 with a summary.\n\n2.\n2.1.\n\nThe Model\n\nGoverning Equations\n\nWe assume that gas accretes on the surface of a compact spherical star of mass M\nand radius R at a rate \u03a3\u0307 (mass per unit area per unit time). We consider all quantities\nto be functions of \u03a3, the column density (mass per unit area) measured from the top of\nthe accreted layer. We use partial derivatives \u2202/\u2202t and \u2202/\u2202\u03a3 to signify Eulerian time and\n\"spatial\" derivatives at a fixed \u03a3, and d/dt to represent the \"Lagrangian\" time derivative\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nfollowing a parcel of accreted gas (see Fushiki & Lamb 1987a):\nd\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2261\n+ \u03a3\u0307 .\ndt\n\u2202t\n\u2202\u03a3\n\n(1)\n\nWe consider only hydrogen and helium burning, and so we describe the composition of the\ngas in terms of the hydrogen mass-fraction X, the helium mass fraction Y , and the heavy\nelement fraction Z = 1 \u2212 X \u2212 Y . These quantities start off with values Xout , Yout , Zout at\n\u03a3 = 0, corresponding to the composition of the gas initially falling on the neutron star, and\nevolve with increasing depth as a result of nuclear burning. Because H-burning is mostly\ndone via the CNO-cycle, it is necessary to know what fraction of Z is in CNO elements (see\nEq. 26). For this, we assume that about 80% of the initial Zout is in CNO, as appropriate for\nsolar composition (Allen 2000), and that all the Z produced via helium burning is entirely\nin CNO; thus, we take\nZCNO = 0.8Zout + (Z \u2212 Zout ).\n(2)\nThe time evolution of the accreting gas is described by a set of five coupled partial\ndifferential equations:\n\u2202P\n\u2202\u03a3\n\u2202T\n\u2202\u03a3\n\u2202F\n\u2202\u03a3\ndX\ndt\ndY\ndt\n\n= g,\n3\u03baF\n,\n16\u03c3T 3\nds\n= \u2212T\n\u2212 (\u01ebH + \u01ebHe ),\ndt\n\u01ebH\n= \u2212 \u2217,\nEH\n\u01ebH\n\u01ebHe\n=\n\u2212 \u2217 .\n\u2217\nEH EHe\n=\n\n(3)\n(4)\n(5)\n(6)\n(7)\n\nTable 1 gives the definitions of the various symbols. We assume that the accreted layer\nis thin relative to the stellar radius, and so we take the gravitational acceleration g to be\nindependent of \u03a3:\n\u0013\u22121/2\n\u0012\n2GM\nGM\n1+z = 1\u2212 2\n,\n(8)\ng = (1 + z) 2 ,\nR\ncR\nwhere z is the gravitational redshift. Note that g and all other quantities in equations (3\u20137)\nare measured in the local frame of the gas. In this spirit, \u03a3\u0307 is the baryonic mass added per\nunit surface area per unit local time.\nEquation (3) describes the condition of hydrostatic equilibrium. By making use of this\nequation rather than the full momentum equation, we filter out sound waves and focus on\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\n\nTable 1.

Equation (4)\ndescribes energy transfer by radiation and conduction. Equation (5) is the energy conservation equation, and equations (6) and (7) describe the evolution of the hydrogen and helium\nmass-fractions as a result of nuclear burning. Equations (3)\u2013(7) require expressions for the\npressure P , the opacity \u03ba, the entropy s, and the energy-generation rates for hydrogen and\nhelium-burning, \u01ebH , \u01ebHe . These are discussed in \u00a72.3.\nThe calculations proceed as follows. We start with a bare neutron star and follow the\nproperties of the accreted layer as gas piles up. For a given column density \u03a3layer of the\naccreted layer, we calculate the following. First, we solve for the quasi-equilibrium state of\nthe system. To do this, we set the Eulerian time derivative \u2202/\u2202t to zero in equations (3\u20137)\nand consider the following set of ordinary differential equations (see Fushiki & Lamb 1987a)\ndP\nd\u03a3\ndT\nd\u03a3\ndF\nd\u03a3\ndX\n\u03a3\u0307\nd\u03a3\ndY\n\u03a3\u0307\nd\u03a3\n\n= g,\n3\u03baF\n,\n16\u03c3T 3\nds\n= \u2212\u03a3\u0307T\n\u2212 (\u01ebH + \u01ebHe ),\nd\u03a3\n\u01ebH\n= \u2212 \u2217,\nEH\n\u01ebH\n\u01ebHe\n=\n\u2212 \u2217 .\n\u2217\nEH EHe\n=\n\n(9)\n(10)\n(11)\n(12)\n(13)\n\nWe solve these equations with boundary conditions (described in \u00a72.2) to obtain the run\nof density \u03c10 (\u03a3), temperature T0 (\u03a3), etc., in quasi-steady state. Note that, because \u03a3layer\nincreases steadily with time, the layer at any given time is not strictly in equilibrium, and\nthe above steady state equations are not precisely valid. However, since \u03a3layer increases only\nslowly with time (on the accretion time scale defined in eq. 17 below), and since many of\nthe physical processes in the layer have shorter characteristic time scales, this is a reasonable\napproximation.\nHaving calculated the steady state equilibrium solution, we carry out a linear perturbation analysis. This is the principal contribution of our work, and represents a significant\nadvance over previous studies. For the perturbation analysis, we assume that the various\nphysical quantities are functions of \u03a3 and t in the form\n\u03c1(\u03a3, t) = \u03c10 (\u03a3) + exp(\u03b3t)\u03c11 (\u03a3),\n\n(14)\n\nT (\u03a3, t) = T0 (\u03a3) + exp(\u03b3t)T1 (\u03a3), etc.,\n\n(15)\n\nwhere \u03c10 , T0 represent the solutions obtained from solving the steady state equations described above, and \u03c11 \u226a \u03c10 , T1 \u226a T0 , are small linear perturbations. The frequency \u03b3\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nrepresents the growth rate of the perturbations. We substitute the perturbed solution into\nthe original time-dependent equations (3\u20137) and linearize in the usual way to obtain a set\nof ordinary differential equations (in \u03a3) for the first-order quantities \u03c11 , T1 , etc. These\nequations are written down in Appendix A and some of their properties are discussed there.\nWe solve the linearized perturbation equations with appropriate boundary conditions and\nthereby obtain \u03b3, which plays the role of an eigenvalue.\nIn general, there are many solutions for \u03b3 for a given steady state solution; some values\nof \u03b3 are real and some are complex. If any solution for \u03b3 has a real part sufficiently large\ncompared to the accretion rate - see equation (21) below for a precise statement of what\nthe criterion is - then we say that the layer is unstable. In this case, we identify R(\u03b3) with\nthe growth rate of the instability in the system. If no solution for \u03b3 satisfies equation (21),\nthen we consider the system to be stable. Because \u03b3 is in general complex, all the quantities\nin the perturbation equations are complex and must be handled with complex arithmetic (in\ncontrast to the steady state equations which involve purely real quantities).\nWe carry out the above two stages of calculations, namely steady state and linear\nperturbation analysis, for each \u03a3layer as matter accumulates on the star. If no instability is\nfound for any choice of \u03a3layer up to a very large value, typically 1013 \u2212 1014 g cm\u22123 - see\nTaam & Picklum (1978) and Brown & Bildsten (1998) for a discussion of carbon flashes which\noccur at yet larger column densities - then we say that the system is stable to bursts. If, for\nsome value of \u03a3layer , we do obtain an instability, then we say that the system will undergo a\nburst when it accumulates this much gas on its surface.\n\n2.2.\n\nBoundary Conditions\n\nThe solution of the five differential equations (9\u201313) for the steady state requires five\nboundary conditions. Four are applied on the outside, at the photosphere (where the optical\ndepth is taken to be 2/3), and one is applied below the accreted layer, deep inside the star.\nThe outer boundary conditions are very similar to the ones employed in Narayan &\nHeyl (2002). The surface values of X and Y are set equal to the corresponding values of the\naccreting gas, namely X = Xout , Y = Yout . We have used a solar composition, Xout = 0.7,\nYout = 0.28 (Allen 2000, Table 3.1), in all the calculations reported in this paper. Next, a\nparticular value is assumed for the escaping flux Fout from the accreted layer. This flux is\nthe result of nuclear burning and compression, and its precise value is determined only after\napplying the inner boundary condition, as explained below. The surface temperature Tout is\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nthen obtained by the condition\n4\n\u03c3Tout\n= Fout + Facc ,\n\nFacc = \u03a3\u0307c2 z(1 + z),\n\n(16)\n\nwhere Facc is the gravitational energy released by the accreting gas, and we have included\nthe appropriate gravitational redshift factor so that all quantities are calculated in the local\nframe. The above relation for Tout is approximate, but we have confirmed that the results\nare very insensitive to the precise choice of Tout . The fourth boundary condition is obtained\nfrom the radiative transfer equation. Given an assumed value for Fout and the condition\nP = 0 at \u03a3 = 0, this equation directly gives the density profile \u03c1(\u03a3).\nAs described above, the solution at the surface is completely specified once a value of\nFout is assumed. The unknown value of Fout is determined by requiring the solution to satisfy\nan inner boundary condition. For this, we assume that the accreting star has a specified\ncore temperature Tcore and we require the solution of the steady state equations to match\nthis temperature. The key issue is where exactly to do the matching. Our approach is as\nas follows. Associated with a given accreted column of depth \u03a3layer , there is a characteristic\naccretion time\n\u03a3layer\ntacc =\n.\n(17)\n\u03a3\u0307\nWe integrate the steady state equations from the surface down to the bottom of the accreted\nlayer at \u03a3layer , and then we integrate further into the stellar substrate to a depth \u03a3diff such\nthat the diffusion time from \u03a3layer to \u03a3diff is equal to twice tacc (the factor of 2 is arbitrary\nand was selected after some numerical experiments):\n\u03c4diff (\u03a3diff ) = 2tacc .\n\n(18)\n\nFor applying this condition, we need an estimate of the thermal diffusion time \u03c4diff (\u03a3) for any\nchoice of \u03a3 inside the star. We obtain this by integrating a separate differential equation:\nd\u03c4diff\n9\u03bakB T (\u03a3 \u2212 \u03a3layer )\n=\n.\nd\u03a3\n128\u03c3T 4 \u03bcmu\n\n(19)\n\nThe form of this equation and the numerical coefficient (which is based on a simple toy model)\nare obtained by treating the energy equation (11) as a diffusion problem. The precise details\nare unimportant for the final results.\nFor the calculations presented in this paper, we pick \"reasonable\" values for Tcore , trying\na range that is likely to bracket the true value. In \u00a75.5 we will estimate the core temperature\nas a function of accretion rate for two kinds of neutrino cooling in the core. If we include both\nthe inward directed flux at the bottom of the layer that we calculate and the energy from\nnuclear reactions in the deep crust (Brown et al. 1998), we find that the latter contribution\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\ndominates. This yields a simple relationship between the accretion luminosity and the core\ntemperature.\nThe above treatment of the inner boundary condition is superior to the method used in\nNarayan & Heyl (2002, and most other previous studies, see \u00a76.1), where the temperature\nat the bottom of the accreted layer was set equal to Tcore . That is, in that calculation,\nthe substrate was assumed to be isothermal immediately below the accreted layer. By\nintegrating down to a couple of diffusion lengths into the substrate, we believe our present\napproach is physically better motivated. However, even with this approach, we are effectively\nassuming that the core below \u03a3diff is perfectly isothermal - hence the use of the term \"core\ntemperature\" - which is again an approximation. For a system that has been accreting and\nbursting for a long time, there is expected to be a small time-averaged flux flowing into the\ncore even inside of \u03a3 = \u03a3diff . In addition, there is a larger flux from deep crustal reactions\n(Brown et al. 1998). Both of these fluxes will induce a temperature gradient, so that the\ntemperature in the crust, which is relevant for bursts, will not be equal to the temperature\nTcore deep inside the neutron star (set for instance by neutrino cooling, see Brown 2000 for\na detailed analysis). This effect may not be very serious, since the matter inside \u03a3diff is\nhighly degenerate and very conductive. Nevertheless, we mention the point here because the\neffect of the approximation is presently not fully understood. We believe that the results\nwe present in this paper for Tcore \u223c 108 K will be hardly affected because the burning layer\nitself has a temperature of this order. However, for very cold cores, e.g., Tcore \u223c 107 K, the\napproximation may have a more serious effect.\nThe above discussion pertains to the equilibrium solution. The linear perturbation\nequations have similar boundary conditions. At the surface, the first-order perturbations\nX1 and Y1 vanish, and we assume an arbitrary value for the flux perturbation F1 ; the latter\nchoice serves as the overall normalization of the perturbed eigenfunction. From the perturbed\nflux, the corresponding temperature perturbation T1 is readily obtained via equation (16),\nand finally the density perturbation \u03c11 is calculated from the radiative transfer equation.\nAt the bottom, we set the temperature perturbation T1 (\u03a3max ) at a prescribed depth\n\u03a3max equal to zero. In analogy with what we did for the steady state solution, we determine\n\u03a3max by the condition that the diffusion time down to this depth should be equal to twice\nthe mode time scale tmode :\n2\n\u03c4diff (\u03a3max ) = 2tmode =\n,\n(20)\n|\u03b3|\nwhere |\u03b3| is the modulus of the complex eigenvalue \u03b3. We only consider modes that grow\nfaster than the accretion time, see below; therefore, \u03a3max is always smaller than \u03a3diff . The\ncondition T1 (\u03a3max ) = 0 provides the final boundary condition that enables us to solve for\nthe eigenmode and the eigenvalue \u03b3.\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nAs already mentioned, there are many solutions for \u03b3. We concentrate on modes that\ngrow fast enough to be interesting, specifically modes that satisfy\nR(\u03b3) \u2265 gmode \u03b3acc ,\n\ngmode = 3,\n\n\u03b3acc \u2261\n\n1\ntacc\n\n=\n\n\u03a3\u0307\n\u03a3layer\n\n.\n\n(21)\n\nThe factor 3 is arbitrary, but reasonable. For an instability to have any noticeable effect on\nthe system, it needs to grow in a time shorter than the lifetime tacc of the system. Also,\nour approach of treating the accreted layer as a quasi-steady system, and analysing the\nperturbations as if they occur in a time-steady system, is valid only if the time scale of the\nperturbations is sufficiently small compared to tacc . For both reasons, the choice, gmode = 3,\nin equation (21) seems appropriate.\n\n2.3.\n\nAuxiliary Prescriptions\n\nThe solution of the set of differential equations described in \u00a72.1 requires knowledge of\nthe thermodynamic and other physical properties of the gas. We describe here the particular\nprescriptions we have used for the calculations presented in this paper.\n\n2.3.1. Equation of State\nThe pressure is assumed to be supplied by photons, nuclei and electrons. For the photons\nwe use the blackbody formula and for the nuclei we assume an ideal non-degenerate gas. In\nthe case of the electrons, we write the pressure as the quadrature sum of two terms, one\nequal to the pressure of an ideal non-degenerate gas and the other equal to the pressure of\na zero-temperature degenerate electron gas. Thus we take (see Paczynski 1983b)\n\u0002 2\n\u0003\n1\n2 1/2\nP = aT 4 + Pnuc,nd + Pe,nd\n+ Pe,d\n,\n3\nPnuc,nd =\n\n\u03c1kB T\n,\n\u03bcnuc mu\n\nPe,nd =\n\n\u03c1kB T\n,\n\u03bce mu\n\n(22)\n(23)\n\nwhere the molecular weights \u03bcnuc and \u03bce are determined in the standard way (e.g. Clayton\n1983). In determining \u03bcnuc , \u03bce , we assume that a fraction 0.2Zout of the heavy elements in the\naccreted layer consists of 56 Fe and the rest (what we have called ZCNO , see eq. 2) consists\nof 14 N (as a surrogate for CNO elements). The latter choice is an approximation. The\ninitial CNO elements in the accreted gas consist mostly of 12 C and 16 O. During H-burning\nvia the CNO cycle, the composition is mostly 14 O and 15 O, while the composition reverts\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nback to 12 C and 16 O after the CNO cycle is done. Considering the other simplifications we\nhave employed, approximating the composition as 14 N for the purposes of calculating the\nmolecular weights seems reasonable. We take the stellar substrate below the accreted layer\nto be made of pure 56 Fe.\nFor the zero-temperature degenerate electron pressure Pdeg , we use an exact expression\nthat is valid for all Fermi energies (Shapiro & Teukolsky 1983). We do not include Coulomb\ncorrections on the pressure. Separating the electron pressure into a non-degenerate part and\na zero-temperature degenerate part and taking the quadrature sum is, again, an approximation. The separation works well in various asymptotic limits and is reasonably accurate\neven in the transition regime between non-degeneracy and degeneracy (Paczynski 1983b).\nWe believe that the approximation is adequate for our purposes since the transition zone is\nusually fairly narrow in \u03a3.\nThe entropy term in equation (5) is important since it is the origin of the compressional\nflux. We write the entropy as the sum of contributions from each nuclear species and the\nelectrons. The entropy per unit mass for species i takes the form\n\u0014\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0012\n3\n5 3\n2\u03c0mi k\nsi = Ni k \u2212 ln(\u03c1Ni ) + ln T + + ln\n,\n(24)\n2\n2 2\nh2\nwhere Ni is the number of particles of the particular species per unit mass of the gas, mi\nis the mass of each particle, and h is Planck's constant. This expression corresponds to an\nideal gas. In the case of the electrons, we use the above entropy so long as the quantity is\npositive, and replace it with zero when the expression becomes negative. This allows us to\nhandle both the non-degenerate and degenerate limits adequately.\n\n2.3.2. Opacity\nWe include radiative and conductive energy transfer, and model the opacity \u03ba as\n1\n1\n1\n=\n+\n.\n\u03ba\n\u03barad \u03bacond\n\n(25)\n\nFor the radiative opacity \u03barad , we use the formulae given in Appendix A of Schatz et al.\n(1999), using the analytic formulae of Antia (1993) to calculate the electron chemical potential.\nTo calculate the conductive opacity we have used the software of Potekhin (1999). Up\nto a density of 109 g cm\u22123 , we include the effects of impurities among the nuclei. Above this\ndensity we assume that the material is pure, and we interpolate between the two regimes.\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nThe density of the fuel layer is nearly always less than 109 g cm\u22123 , except for some rare\nhelium bursts.\n\n2.3.3. Nuclear Energy Generation Rates\nFor \u01ebH , we include the pp chain and the CNO cycle. Because the temperature of the\nburning material is on the order of 108 K, the CNO cycle usually dominates. We include\nfast-CNO burning, saturated CNO burning and electron capture reactions, as described in\nMathews & Dietrich (1984) and Bildsten & Cumming (1998), and write the energy-generation\nrate as\nZCNO\n\u01ebH,CNO = 4EH\u2217 rCNO\n,\n(26)\n14\nwhere rCNO is the rate of reactions per CNO nucleus, and we have assumed that in equilibrium\nthe majority of the CNO nuclei are 14 N (Clayton 1983). For the reaction rate, we assume\n\u0013\u22121 \u0014\u0012 \u0013 \u0012\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0012\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n+\n.\n+\nrCNO =\n\u03c413 862.0 s\n\u03c413\n\u03c413 + \u03c414 + 278.2 s\n862.0 s\n\u03c414 + 1038.0 s\n(27)\n13\n13\n14\nHere, \u03c413 is the lifetime of N against the reaction N(p, \u03b3) O (Mathews & Dietrich 1984),\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0001\u22121 h\n\u22122/3\n\u22121/3\n3.35 \u00d7 107 T9\nexp \u221215.202 T9\n\u2212 0.8702 T92\n\u03c413 = X\u03c1/g cm\u22123\n\u0011\n\u0010\n1/3\n2/3\n4/3\n5/3\n(28)\n\u00d7 1 + 0.027 T9 + 0.9 T9 + 0.173 T9 + 4.61 T9 + 2.26 T9\n\u0001i\u22121\n\u22123/2\n+ 3.03 \u00d7 105 T9\nexp \u22126.348 T9\u22121\ns,\nwhere T9 = T /(109K), and \u03c414 is the lifetime of\nPaczynski 1983a),\n\u03c414 = 3.1 \u00d7 10\n\n10\n\n\u0001\n\u22123 \u22121\n\nX\u03c1/gcm\n\n14\n\nN against the reaction\n\n2/3\nT6\n\n\u0010\n\nexp 152.313\n\n\u22121/3\nT6\n\n\u0011\n\n14\n\nN(p, \u03b3)15 O (e.g.\n\ns,\n\n(29)\n\nwhere T6 = T /(106 K). The time scale 862.0 s refers to the beta-decay timescale of 13 N,\n278.2 s is the sum of the beta-decay timescales of 14 O and 15 O, and 1038.0 s is the sum of\nthe beta-decay timescales of 13 N and 15 O. In deriving the above rates we have assumed that\nthe various species have reached their equilibrium abundances.\nFigure 1 shows the variation of \u01ebH and \u01ebHe with temperature for some typical densities.\nFor low and moderate temperatures, the hydrogen-burning rate is a steeply increasing function of temperature, and it is this steep dependence that drives a thermonuclear instability.\nFor a temperature greater than about 107.8 \u2212 107.9 K, however, hydrogen-burning switches\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nrather abruptly to the saturated burning regime. Beyond this temperature, hydrogenburning is stable. As we discuss in \u00a73, this change has a noticeable effect on the sequence of\nequilibria. We have corrected the proton capture rates for screening using the formulae of\nDewitt et al. (1973) for the non-resonant reactions and the formulae of Itoh et al. (2003) for\nthe resonant reaction (13 N(p, \u03b3)14 O). Screening increases the reaction rates at temperatures\nwhere the CNO cycle is not saturated.\nFor \u01ebHe , we use the fitting formula given in equations (4.7), (4.8a) and (4.8b) of Fushiki\n& Lamb (1987b) which include screening. We introduce a smooth transition between the\nvarious regimes defined by these authors in order to more faithfully reproduce the numerical\nresults they have depicted in their Fig. 3. Our fitting results are shown in Fig. 1.\n\n3.\n\nEquilibrium Solutions\n\nPaczynski (1983a) has presented a very helpful analysis of the stability of nuclear burning\non the surface of a compact star. His model involves numerous simplifications: he uses a onezone approximation, he considers only helium burning, and he assumes an inner boundary\ncondition on the flux rather than on the temperature. Nevertheless, many of the insights\nhe has obtained via his simple analysis carry over to our more detailed work. In particular,\nfollowing his work, we have found it very helpful to consider equilibria in the Fout -\u03a3layer\nplane. Appendix A discusses why the insights from Paczy\u0144ski's analysis apply to our more\ncomplicated model.\nFigures 2 and 3 show sequences of equilibria of the accreted layer for a 1.4M\u2299 neutron\nstar with a radius of 10.4 km and a core temperature of 108 K. The different panels correspond\nto different mass accretion rates \u1e40 , parameterized by the accretion luminosity Lacc measured\nat infinity,\nz\nLacc = \u1e40 c2\n\u2261 lacc LEdd ,\n(30)\n(1 + z)\nwhere LEdd = 4\u03c0GMc/\u03baes , with \u03baes = 0.4 cm2 g\u22121 , is the Eddington luminosity measured at\ninfinity. The local surface mass accretion rate \u03a3\u0307 is related to \u1e40 by\n\u03a3\u0307 =\n\n\u1e40\n(1 + z).\n4\u03c0R2\n\n(31)\n\nThe mass accretion rate \u1e40, or equivalently \u03a3\u0307, is a key parameter that determines the nature\nof bursts. Since it is however not directly measured, we prefer to give all our results in terms\nof the dimensionless luminosity lacc = Lacc /LEdd . In doing this, we assume that the accretion\nis radiatively efficient and satisfies the relation given in equation (30).\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\n\nFig.\n1.- Nuclear reaction rates for hydrogen and helium, plotted as a function\nof temperature.\nFrom bottom to top, the four curves correspond to densities of\n5\n5.5\n6\n6.5\n10 , 10 , 10 , 10 g cm\u22123 .

In each panel, the\nhorizontal axis shows the escaping flux fout from the accreted layer, normalized by the\nmaximum nuclear burning energy available in the accreting gas:\nfout \u2261\n\nFout\n,\nFnuc\n\n\u2217\nFnuc = \u03a3\u0307 [Xout EH\u2217 + (Xout + Yout )EHe\n].\n\n(32)\n\nThe vertical axis shows the column density of the layer, \u03a3layer .\nThe most obvious feature of the various panels is that the equilibria do not form monotonic sequences in the Fout -\u03a3layer plane. At a given \u03a3layer , there can be one, three, or even\nfive, distinct solutions for Fout . (There are no cases of five solutions in the sequences shown\nhere, but it is fairly common when the core temperature is lower, e.g., 107.5 K). Because the\nequations are nonlinear and include many different physical effects, it is not surprising to\nhave multiple solutions.\nConsider as an example Fig. 2(b), which corresponds to an accretion luminosity log(lacc ) =\n\u22120.75. The sequence of equilibria shows two peaks, one at log(fout ) \u223c \u22122 and one at \u223c \u22120.5.\nIn addition, at the very right, there is a steep vertical segment which we refer to as the \"wall.\"\nFig. 4 shows other details of the equilibria for this choice of lacc ; panel (a) is a plot of \u03a3layer\nvs the temperature Tlayer at the base of the layer, while panel (b) shows the variation of the\nH-fraction Xlayer , He-fraction Ylayer and heavy element fraction Zlayer at the bottom of the\nlayer.\nWhen the column depth of the accreted layer \u03a3layer is very small, the gas is neither\nhot nor dense and does not undergo any nuclear burning. Thus, Xlayer = Xout , Ylayer =\nYout , Zlayer = Zout , and the flux Fout that emerges is mostly what is released as a result of\ncompressing the accreting gas, plus any flux that escapes from the 108 K core. This stage\ncorresponds to the nearly vertical segment at the left of Fig. 2(b). As \u03a3 increases, the gas\nat the bottom of the layer becomes hotter. Ultimately, when \u03a3 \u223c 107.3 g cm\u22122 and the\ntemperature is about 107.7 K, hydrogen-burning begins. Soon after this, hydrogen-burning\ntakes over as the dominant term in the energy equation, and at this point, the \u03a3layer -Fout\ncurve in Fig. 2(b), as well as \u03a3layer -Tlayer curve in Fig. 4(a), reverse direction, producing the\npeak on the left in the two plots. We identify this peak as the \"hydrogen peak.\" The onset\nof hydrogen-burning is also evident in the run of Xlayer in Fig. 4(b) (see also Ylayer whose\nvariations simply reflect the amount of helium produced by hydrogen-burning).\nAs we descend from the top of the hydrogen peak in the direction of increasing Fout and\nTlayer , a point is reached when hydrogen-burning becomes saturated (because the reactions\nare beta-limited). This happens around Tlayer \u223c 107.9 K. Beyond this point, the sequence of\nequilibria start rising again in the \u03a3layer -Fout and \u03a3layer -Tlayer planes. The rise continues for\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\n\nFig. 4.- Additional details of the equilibrium sequence shown in Fig. 2b. (a) Shows the\ncolumn density \u03a3layer of the accreted layer as a function of the temperature Tlayer at the\nbottom of the layer. The open circles, the filled circles and the stars have the same meaning\nas in Fig. 2. (b) Shows the mass fractions of hydrogen, helium and metals at the bottom of\nthe layer as a function of the normalized outgoing flux.\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\na while, with more and more hydrogen being burnt into helium until at \u03a3layer \u223c 108.1 g cm\u22122\nand Tlayer \u223c 108.3 K, helium-burning is initiated. At this point there is a second peak in the\nsequence of equilibria, the \"helium peak.\"\nAs the sequence of equilibria fall off from the helium peak, the helium is burned rapidly,\nand the CNO elements that this produces cause the hydrogen-burning also to pick up since\nthe rate of hydrogen burning is proportional to ZCNO (eq. 26). When the hydrogen and\nhelium are almost all exhausted, the sequence of equilibria turn round again and march up\nthe wall. In this segment of the curve, very little changes as a function of increasing \u03a3. The\nhydrogen and helium are burned close to the surface within a column of order 108 g cm\u22122 ,\nand the rest of the accreted layer consists just of burned CNO material which is progressively\ncompressed by the weight of the overlying gas. Note that, since helium burning by the triple\u03b1 reaction is not beta-limited, there is no regime of saturated helium burning. Therefore, the\ntransition from the declining slope of the helium peak to the rapidly rising wall is generally\nquite abrupt. Figure 4(a) shows that, as \u03a3layer increases on the wall, the temperature at the\nbase of the layer falls. This is because there is a net flux flowing from the layer into the star.\nThe nuclear burning occurs at a fixed \u03a3 in this sequence of wall models. With increasing\n\u03a3layer , there is a larger dead column between the burning layer and the base of the layer,\nand the ingoing flux causes the temperature at the base to drop.\nWe should note at this point that not all equlibria shown in Figs. 2\u20134 are accessible to a\nreal system. Imagine starting with a bare neutron star and adding gas at the specified rate \u03a3\u0307.\nAs \u03a3layer increases, the system will ride up the left slope of the hydrogen peak. When \u03a3layer is\nequal to the maximum \u03a3 \u223c 107.3 g cm\u22122 of the hydrogen peak, the system no longer has any\nequilibria available in the vicinity of the peak. Therefore, it will relax towards the nearest\navailable equilibrium, which is a solution with the same value of \u03a3layer \u223c 107.3 g cm\u22122 on the\nleft slope of the helium peak. Thus, all the equilibria on the right slope of the hydrogen peak\nand the lower left slope of the helium peak will be by-passed, since they correspond to lower\nvalues of \u03a3layer than the current layer thickness. With increasing \u03a3layer , the system will ride\nup the helium peak until it reaches the maximum \u03a3 \u223c 108.1 g cm\u22122 of the helium peak. At\nthis point, the system will once again move across to the nearest available solution, which\nis located on the wall, bypassing the equilibria in the valley to the right of the helium peak.\nHaving reached the wall, the system will continue rising up the wall with increasing \u03a3layer .\nLet us turn now to the other sequences of equilibria shown in Figs. 2 and 3. Fig. 2(a)\ncorresponds to log(lacc ) = \u22120.5. In this case, because of the rapid accretion rate, the accreted\nlayer is quite hot, and so hydrogen burning is already in the saturated limit when it turns on.\nThere is, therefore, no hydrogen peak (though there is the semblance of a plateau). Fig. 2(b)\nwas discussed above, and has a modest hydrogen peak. Note that the helium peak in Fig.\n\n\f\u2013 20 \u2013\n2(b) is pushed to the right relative to the peak in Fig. 2(a). This is because helium requires\na temperature of at least about 2 \u00d7 108 K to burn (Fig. 1), and such high temperatures are\nobtained at the lower accretion rate only at larger values of Fout . With decreasing accretion\nrate, the gas temperature continues to fall and the hydrogen peak becomes more pronounced\n(Figs. 2c,d). The helium peak also gets pushed progressively farther to the right, until it\nfinally hits the wall and disappears. For accretion luminosities below about 10\u22121.25 LEdd ,\nthere is no helium peak. Helium now starts burning on the wall, at progressively larger\nvalues of \u03a3layer with decreasing lacc .\nThe above results are for a core temperature of Tcore = 108 K. The pattern of peaks\ncan be different for other core temperatures. If the core temperature is a few times 108 K,\nthe hot core keeps the accreted layer hot under all circumstances and hydrogen burning is\nalways in the saturated regime. In this case, there is no separate hydrogen peak. On the\nother hand, for lower values of Tcore , e.g. a few times 107 K, the hydrogen peak becomes\nquite pronounced and also has a higher peak value of \u03a3layer . In this case, it is often possible\nto have situations in which the helium peak is lower than the hydrogen peak. If such is the\ncase, when the system reaches the top of the hydrogen peak it will move directly across to\nthe wall without stopping at the helium peak.\n\n4.\n\nStability\n\nThe previous section described sequences of equilibria for various mass accretion rates.\nAs explained in \u00a72, for every equilibrium we carry out a linear stability analysis to check\nwhether the system is stable or unstable (the latter is determined by the criterion given in eq.\n21). In Figs. 2 and 3, open circles indicate stable equilibria, filled circles indicate unstable\nequilibria in which the most unstable mode has a real \u03b3 \u2265 3\u03b3acc , and stars indicate unstable\nequilibria in which the fastest-growing mode has a complex \u03b3, with R(\u03b3) \u2265 3\u03b3acc .\nFrom the various panels in Figs. 2 and 3, we quickly discern the following patterns.\nThe left slopes of the hydrogen and helium peaks always correspond to stable equilibria,\nwhile the right slopes of both are always unstable; this is similar to the pattern described by\nPaczynski (1983a, who only considered He-burning) and is easily understood from his onezone analysis. As explained in Appendix A, the same pattern is expected in our problem as\nwell. The stability of equilibria on the wall is variable. Sometimes the equilibria on the wall\nare fully stable, sometimes they are fully unstable, and sometimes some equilibria are stable\nand some are unstable. As we discuss now, it is the stability of the wall that determines\nwhether or not a particular accretion rate leads to thermonuclear bursts.\n\n\f\u2013 21 \u2013\nConsider as an example the case shown in Fig. 2(b), corresponding to log(lacc ) = \u22121.\nStarting from the bare neutron star, as gas piles up, the system moves up the hydrogen peak\nalong a sequence of equilibria that are all stable (open circles). When \u03a3layer hits the top of\nthe hydrogen peak, the system moves across to a point on the left slope of the helium peak\nwith the same value of \u03a3layer . There is some adjustment of the accreted layer in order to\nswitch to the new solution, but because the equilibrium solution here is stable the system is\nable to make the adjustment. With increasing \u03a3layer , the system climbs up the helium peak\nalong a sequence of stable equilibria. As before, once it reaches the top of the peak, it moves\nacross to the right, this time to the wall, and the solution here is again stable. However, as\nthe system climbs up the wall, it reaches a point at which the equilibrium is unstable. At\nthis point, there is no stable equilibria available for any value of fout . The system therefore\nundergoes a thermonuclear burst.\nWe may now quickly identify which of the other cases shown in Fig. 2 and 3 are stable\nand which unstable. The high accretion rate system in Fig. 2(a) is stable because the states\non the wall are all stable. The system will move across to the wall after it hits the helium\npeak, and it will then climb up the wall along a sequence of stable equilibria to arbitrarily\nlarge values of \u03a3layer . The cases shown in Figs. 2(b), 3(a),(b) are all similar. These systems\nreach the wall stably, climb part way up the wall and then go unstable; we call all these cases\n\"delayed bursts.\" In contrast, the cases shown in Figs. 2(c),(d), 3(c),(d) become unstable\nthe moment they hit the top of the last peak since there are no stable equilibria available on\nthe wall; we call these \"prompt bursts.\"\n\n4.1.\n\nUnstable vs Overstable Modes\n\nWe pause to discuss the distinction between modes with real \u03b3 and those with complex \u03b3.\nThe former correspond to a simple instability, where the mode amplitude grows exponentially\nwith time, whereas the latter correspond to an overstability, where the mode oscillates at a\nfrequency equal to the imaginary part of \u03b3 even as the amplitude grows. As Figs. 2 and 3\nshow, we see both kinds of behavior for our unstable modes. We should note that complex\neigenvalues \u03b3 always appear in complex conjugate pairs, which is obvious from the structure\nof the governing equations.\nAs explained in Appendix A, from an inspection of the steady state and linear perturbation equations, it can be seen that any system that is at the top of a peak or the bottom of\na valley, i.e., where d\u03a3layer /dFout = 0, has a zero-frequency mode, \u03b3 = 0. Once we recognize\nthis important rule, we can understand why the right slopes of the hydrogen and helium\npeaks are unstable. The argument goes as follows: the left slopes are stable, with all modes\n\n\f\u2013 22 \u2013\nhaving R(\u03b3) < 0; the peak has a mode with \u03b3 = 0; by continuity, this particular mode should\nhave \u03b3 > 0 on the right slope and should be real.\nThe above rule has a corollary: if the system makes a transition from stability to\ninstability at a point where d\u03a3layer /dFout 6= 0, then the unstable mode at this point must\nhave a complex \u03b3. This rule applies, for instance, to all the systems that have delayed\nbursts, i.e., become unstable half-way up the wall, e.g., Figs. 2(b), 3(a),(b). In these cases,\nwhen the system moves into the unstable zone, it always first hits an overstable region.\nThe overstability may in some cases then become a pure instability as a pair of modes with\ncomplex \u03b3 merge to spin off a pair of real \u03b3. Also, it is not possible to tell \"how complex\"\nthe mode is, i.e., the relative magnitudes of R(\u03b3) and I(\u03b3).\nFinally, in cases where the wall is entirely unstable, we have not been able to find any\nhelpful rule. Whether the instability corresponds to real or complex \u03b3 can be determined\nonly with a full calculation.\n\n4.2.\n\nBurst Energetics and Trigger Mechanism\n\nBecause there are two burning fuels, hydrogen and helium, we would like to know which\nfuel determines the burst properties. There are two aspects to this question.\nFirst, once an instability has been triggered, we would like to know how much energy\nis available for the burst in unburnt helium compared to the energy in unburnt hydrogen.\nFigure 5 shows this quantity as a function of accretion rate for three choices of the neutron\nstar radius (assuming a mass of 1.4M\u2299 ) and four core temperatures. We have assumed that\nall the energy in the unburnt fuel is emitted as radiation during the burst. In actuality, some\nenergy is lost into the core and some comes out as neutrinos; we neglect this complication.\nIn interpreting the results, we should note that hydrogen-burning to iron provides nearly\n5 times more energy per gram than helium-burning to iron. Keeping this in mind, we see that\nfor high mass accretion rates roughly in the range log(lacc ) \u223c \u22120.6 to \u22121.5 (the precise values\ndepend on the neutron star radius and core temperature), the bursts are of a mixed kind with\nenergy being contributed by both hydrogen and helium. For intermediate accretion rates,\nlog(lacc ) \u223c \u22121.5 to \u22122.5, we have pure helium-burning bursts. Finally, for log(lacc ) . \u22122.5,\nwe again have mixed bursts. Actually, this last range corresponds to pure hydrogen bursts\nand it is not clear if helium burning will be triggered during the burst. In making our\nestimates we assumed that all the unburnt fuel is consumed. The ranges of log(lacc ) given\nhere correspond to a core temperature of 108 K and a neutron star radius of 10.4 km.\n\n\f\u2013 23 \u2013\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n0\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\nFig. 5.- Ratio of the fluence in the burst due to helium burning to the fluence from\nhydrogen burning, assuming that each fuel is burned to 56 Fe. The four panels correspond\nto core temperatures Tcore = 108.5 , 108 , 107.5 and 107 K, respectively. In each panel, the\ntriangles, circles and stars trace the results for a neutron star of mass 1.4M\u2299 and radii\nR = 100.6 RS = 16.4 km, 100.4 RS = 10.4 km, and 100.2 RS = 6.5 km, respectively. Note that\nhydrogen and helium burning both contribute at high and low luminosities (with hydrogen\nbeing about five times more important energetically per unit mass), while helium burning\ndominates at intermediate luminosities log(lacc ) \u223c \u22121.5 to \u22122.5.\n\n\f\u2013 24 \u2013\nAnother interesting question is to understand what precisely triggers the burst instability. One way to do this is to look at the maximum temperature in the fuel layer (Fig. 6)\nand to thereby identify which fuel might be important. As we discussed in \u00a72.3, hydrogen\nburning becomes saturated, and hence stable, for temperatures above about 107.9 K (see\nFig. 1). Therefore, we expect hydrogen-triggered bursts at lower temperatures and heliumtriggered bursts at higher temperatures. From Fig. 6 we see that the former occur at lower\naccretion rates and the latter at higher accretion rates. However, there is no clear way to\ndistinguish the kinds of bursts from this plot since the variation of Tmax with accretion luminosity is smooth. In our models, we do not find unstable modes for layers with maximum\ntemperatures above 3.5 \u00d7 108 K. This temperature limit is reached at log(lacc ) \u223c \u22120.6.\nGaining a deeper understanding of what triggers the bursts requires an examination\nof the eigenfunctions of the unstable modes. Specifically, we compute the contribution of\nhelium burning integrated over the eigenfunction and take the ratio of this to the hydrogen\nburning integrated over the eigenfunction (here we do not consider the additional burning\nto iron as we did with the burst fluence ratio). The ratio should be large for a pure heliumtriggered burst and small for a pure hydrogen-triggered burst, and on the order of 0.1 \u2212 0.2\nfor mixed-triggered burst (the ratio is not 0.5 in this case since hydrogen-burning releases\nnearly an order of magnitude more energy per gram than helium-burning).\nFigure 7 shows the above ratio as a function of log(lacc ) for the same three choices of\nthe neutron star radius and four choices of the core temperature. We see that, at high\nmass accretion rates log(lacc ) \u223c \u22120.6 to \u22121.5, the bursts are triggered by both hydrogen\nand helium. Within this range, the higher accretion rates give delayed bursts, while the\nlower rates give prompt bursts (as seen from Fig. 2). For intermediate accretion rates\nlog(lacc ) \u223c \u22121.5 to \u22122.5, we have pure helium-triggered bursts. These all involve overstable\nmodes. Finally, for log(lacc ) < \u22122.5, we have hydrogen-triggered bursts. These are pure\nunstable modes (real \u03b3).\nFigures 8\u20139 show a typical eigenmode corresponding to log(lacc ) = \u22120.9. Near the surface (\u03a3 \u2192 0), all perturbations vanish according to our boundary conditions, except the flux,\nwhich is given a unit perturbation (in arbitrary units - it merely sets the normalization).\nThe accreted layer extends up to \u03a3layer , which is indicated by the thick vertical line. The\neigenfunction then continues on into the substrate to a depth such that the diffusion time to\nthat point is equal to twice the mode time scale (see \u00a72.2). Note that, even though the inner\nboundary condition corresponds to a vanishing temperature perturbation, in fact the flux\nperturbation also vanishes at this point. This shows that our choice of the inner boundary\nis physically well-motivated. We have tried integrating the eigenmode to larger or smaller\ndepth in the substrate and generally obtained the same results.\n\n\f\u2013 25 \u2013\n\nFig. 6.- The maximum temperature Tmax achieved in the accreted layer when the layer first\nbecomes unstable, plotted as a function of the accretion luminosity.

However, the perturbations in X and Z are limited\nto a very narrow layer. This is the burning layer, which is shown in an expanded view in\nFig. 9. The fluctuation in X indicates hydrogen burning and the fluctuation in Z corresponds\nto helium burning. For this mode, we see that both fuels burn at roughly the same depth,\nindicating that it is an example of a mixed burst. Also, since the eigenmode has nontrivial\nreal and imaginary parts, we have a complex eigenvalue \u03b3. In this particular case, the real\npart of \u03b3 is equal to 8.9 \u00d7 10\u22125 s\u22121 and the imaginary part is equal to 6.6 \u00d7 10\u22124 s\u22121 .\nAt lower accretion rates, the eigenmodes tend to be simpler. If we consider the critical\nvalues of \u03a3layer at which the systems shown in Figs. 3(a),(b) become unstable, the burning\nis dominated by helium and there is only a small contribution from hydrogen. Moreover, the\ntwo fuels tend to burn at different values of \u03a3. The eigenmode is still complex, though the\nimaginary part is not very large. If we go to yet lower accretion rates as in Figs. 3(c),(d),\nthen there is no helium burning at all and the burning layer is dominated by hydrogen. In\nthis case, the eigenmode is fully real.\n\n4.3.\n\nPutting Things Together\n\nPulling together the various ideas discussed above, we identify five regimes of bursting\nbehavior as a function of decreasing accretion luminosity. In the following, the numerical\nvalues correspond to the particular calculations presented earlier, in which M = 1.4M\u2299 ,\nR = 100.4 RS = 10.4 km, Tcore = 108 K. Tables 2 and 3 give results for other selected choices\nof R and Tcore .\nI. For very high accretion rates, with log(lacc ) > \u22120.6, there are no thermonuclear bursts.\nThis is the regime of stable accretion, where the accreting gas is able to burn the nuclear\nfuel without instability.\nII. For somewhat lower accretion rates log(lacc ) \u223c \u22120.6 to \u22120.85, we have mixed bursts\ntriggered by both hydrogen and helium. These bursts burn substantial amounts of both\nfuels. In this particular accretion range, the instability is delayed and is triggered only after\nthe system climbs part way up the wall. We call these \"delayed mixed bursts.\" As the system\nclimbs up the wall, a large fraction of the nuclear fuel is burned stably in the accreted layer\nbefore the burst is triggered.4 As we shall see, this has dramatic consequences for both the\n4\n\nNote that, on the wall, fout is nearly equal to unity, which means that the escaping flux in the equilibrium solution is almost equal to the nuclear energy content of the new fuel being added to the surface.\n\n\f\u2013 30 \u2013\nrecurrence times of the bursts and the ratio of the burst fluence to the total accretion fluence\nbetween bursts. When the system becomes unstable, the mode has a complex \u03b3, which\ncorresponds to an overstability. Thus, we expect the system to show an oscillatory behavior\nas it approaches the instability.\nIII. For yet lower accretion rates log(lacc ) \u223c \u22120.9 to \u22121.25, we continue to have mixed\ntriggered bursts burning mixed fuel. However, here the entire wall is unstable and so the\ninstability is triggered when the system reaches the top of the helium peak. Because the\nburst happens as soon as the system hits the wall, we refer to these as \"prompt mixed\nbursts,\" to distinguish them from the previous class of delayed mixed bursts. When the\ninstability first begins at the peak, \u03b3 is real, but when the system reaches the wall, \u03b3 may\npossibly be complex (though not always). We cannot tell from our present analysis whether\nor not the system will show oscillatory behavior prior to the burst.\nIV. For still lower accretion rates log(lacc ) \u223c \u22121.3 to -2.5, bursts are again triggered only after\nthe system climbs part way up the wall, i.e., we have delayed bursts. Here the instability\nis helium-triggered and the burst is dominated by helium burning. These correspond to\nthe classic \"helium bursts\" that have been studied by previous authors. According to our\ncalculations, \u03b3 is complex when these systems go unstable, and this means that there should\nbe some kind of oscillatory behavior prior to the burst. In practice, the imaginary parts of\n\u03b3 tend to be small for these modes.\nV. Finally, for the lowest accretion rates log(lacc ) < \u22122.5, the wall is again unstable, and now\nthe burst happens as soon as the system hits the top of the hydrogen peak. The instability\nis triggered by hydrogen burning, and we call these \"hydrogen bursts.\" They do not have\nany oscillatory behavior. It is not clear if these hydrogen bursts will trigger helium burning.\nIf they do not, then the helium will accumulate as the ashes of hydrogen burning and the\nsystem is likely to have enormous but very rare helium bursts.\nThe various regimes described above are summarized in Tables 2, 3. Much of our\ndiscussion in the rest of the paper is in terms of the burst regimes discussed in this section.\nMany of the regimes have been recognized by previous authors (Fujimoto et al. 1981; Fushiki\n& Lamb 1987a; Bildsten 2000), but one of the new ideas to come out of our analysis is the\ndistinction between delayed mixed bursts and prompt mixed bursts. This distinction has\nnot been made earlier. The other new aspect is our ability to distinguish between simple\nexponential instability and oscillatory overstability. It is unique to our work since this is the\nNevertheless, the accreted layer does possess energy in unburnt fuel. Loosely speaking, it is the unburnt\nfuel that accumulated in the layer prior to reaching the wall. The energy from burning this fueld is released\nduring the burst.\n\n\f\u2013 31 \u2013\n\nTable 2.

We have focused on this\ncase since it represents the likely core temperature for standard neutrino cooling models of\naccreting neutron stars. For higher core temperatures, e.g., 108.5 K, the hydrogen-burning\nlayer is hotter than 107.8 K so that the systems are in the saturated hydrogen-burning limit.\nThey therefore lack the hydrogen-triggered bursts at low accretion rates. On the other hand,\nif the core temperature is lower, e.g., 107 K, the prompt mixed bursts are no longer triggered\nby the helium peak. Instead, the bursts are triggered when the accreted layer reaches the\ntop of the hydrogen peak, which is now higher than the helium peak. The bursts are still\nof the mixed variety though. In addition, there are quantitative differences as a function of\nneutron star radius and core temperature. These are discussed in the next section.\n\n5.\n5.1.\n\nResults\n\nDifferent Regimes of Bursting\n\nFigure 10 depicts the various bursting regimes as a function of the radius of the neutron\nstar and the accretion rate. The results shown are for core temperatures of Tcore = 108 K and\n107 K. The blank areas correspond to stable nuclear burning, the symbols enclosed within\ncircles correspond to prompt bursts and the naked symbols correspond to delayed bursts.\nThe five regimes of bursting behavior described in \u00a74.3 and summarized in Tables 2, 3 are\nclearly delineated.\nMoving from right to left in the panel corresponding to 108 K, we see that at the highest\nmass accretion rates there is no burst activity since these systems consume hydrogen and\nhelium stably (region I in \u00a74.3). Immediately to the left is a region of delayed mixed bursts\n(region II). At lower accretion rates, there is a zone of prompt mixed bursts (symbols with\ncircles, region III). Then there is a relatively broad zone of delayed helium bursts (region\nIV), and finally, at the lowest accretion rates, a region of prompt hydrogen bursts (symbols\nwith circles, region V).\nSome of the boundaries between the different zones are remarkably insensitive to the\nneutron star radius, though the zone of prompt mixed bursts does vary with radius, at\nleast for Tcore = 108 K. For very compact neutron stars, e.g., log(R/RS ) = 0.2, this zone\nis reasonably wide, whereas for log(R/RS ) = 0.6, the zone almost disappears. The zone of\nprompt mixed bursts is much broader for Tcore = 107 K. These variations with radius and\n\n\f\u2013 33 \u2013\nTcore lead to noticeable signatures in many of the diagnostics that we discuss later.\nIn Fig. 10, the points represented with stars correspond to overstable modes with complex \u03b3 and the triangles correspond to unstable modes with real \u03b3. In accordance with the\ndiscussion in \u00a74.3, we see that delayed bursts are nearly always overstable, while prompt\nbursts are either overstable or unstable.\nThe map of the different burst regimes is roughly the same at other core temperatures,\nthough the widths and locations of the various zones tend to vary. Generally, the regime of\ndelayed mixed bursts becomes somewhat narrower with decreasing Tcore . Also, for Tcore =\n108.5 K, there are no hydrogen bursts, i.e., the leftmost region of filled triangles within circles\nis absent. These patterns may be noticed in several of the plots discussed later.\n\n5.2.\n\nBurst Recurrence Time\n\nWe begin our overview of the observable properties of thermonuclear bursts on neutron\nstars with the recurrence time trec , i.e., the average time between bursts. Because we only\ntreat the physics of the accreted layer until a burst is initiated, but not the burst itself, we\nneed to make some assumption as to how much of the available fuel is consumed in a burst.\nIn our calculations we assume that all the fuel is burned, which means that our estimates\nof trec are really upper limits to the observed recurrence time. With this approximation, if\n\u03a3layer,crit is the critical column depth of the accreted layer at which a burst is initiated, then\nthe recurrence time trec measured by a distant observer is given by\ntrec = (1 + z)\n\n\u03a3layer,crit\n.\n\u03a3\u0307\n\n(33)\n\nFigure 11 shows trec as a function of the accretion luminosity for three choices of the\nneutron star radius, log(R/RS ) = 0.2, 0.4, 0.6 (i.e., R = 16.4, 10.4, 6.5 km), and four core\ntemperatures, Tcore = 108.5 , 108 , 107.5 , 107 K. The 108 K panel, and to some extent the 107.5\nK panel, clearly show the different regimes of bursting behavior discussed in the previous\nsubsection, especially for smaller neutron star radii. The recurrence time tends to become\nlarger for delayed bursts compared to prompt bursts. The straight band of points between\nlog(lacc ) \u223c \u22121 and \u22121.6 for the two smaller radii corresponds to prompt mixed bursts. This\nband is missing for the largest radius because, as seen in Fig. 10, the region of prompt mixed\nbursts disappears for that radius.\nOne obvious pattern in Fig. 11 is that there is a general overall increase of trec with\ndecreasing Lacc . This is because \u03a3\u0307 becomes lower with decreasing accretion rate, so it takes\nlonger to build up a given accretion column. To illustrate this point, Fig. 12 shows the\n\n\f\u2013 34 \u2013\n\n0.6\n\n0.6\n\n0.5\n\n0.5\n\n0.4\n\n0.4\n\n0.3\n\n0.3\n\n0.2\n\n0.2\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\nFig. 10.- Regimes of burning on the surface of a 1.4M\u2299 neutron star for Tcore = 108 K and\n107 K. The empty areas correspond to stable burning, the filled triangles denote regions with\nunstable modes (real \u03b3), and the stars to regions with overstable/oscillatory modes (complex\n\u03b3). Prompt bursts (see the text for an explanation) are shown by symbols circumscribed\nwith a circle, and delayed bursts are shown by symbols without circles. Starting from the\nright, with decreasing luminosity, one goes through the following sequence: stable, delayed\nmixed bursts, prompt mixed bursts, helium bursts, hydrogen bursts (compare with Table 3).\n\n\f\u2013 35 \u2013\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n4\n\n4\n\n2\n\n2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n4\n\n4\n\n2\n\n2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\nFig. 11.- The burst recurrence time trec for a distant observer, assuming that all the fuel is\nconsumed.

The\nfour regimes of bursting described in \u00a74.3 and summarized in Tables 2, 3 are clearly seen in\nmany of the sequences.\n\n\f\u2013 36 \u2013\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n11\n\n11\n\n10\n\n10\n\n9\n\n9\n\n8\n\n8\n\n7\n11\n\n7\n11\n\n10\n\n10\n\n9\n\n9\n\n8\n\n8\n\n7\n\n7\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\nFig. 12.- Critical column density of accreted material \u03a3layer,crit at the onset of the burst.\nThe symbols and layout are the same as in Fig. 11.\n\n\f\u2013 37 \u2013\ndependence of \u03a3layer,crit for the various cases. We see that, for the prompt mixed bursts,\n\u03a3layer,crit is more or less constant.\nThe results for the other core temperatures are generally reasonable. For Tcore = 108.5 K,\nthe recurrence times are fairly similar to the 108 K case, except that there are no hydrogen\nbursts at low mass accretion rates. The case of Tcore = 107.5 K is very similar to 108 K.\nHowever, for Tcore = 107 K, the column needed to produce bursts tends to be higher. This\nleads to significantly longer recurrence times.\nThe shortest recurrence time we find in the model is about 5 hours, which occurs at\nlog(lacc ) \u223c \u22121 for intermediate core temperatures Tcore \u223c 107.5 \u2212 108 K. The corresponding\nmaximum burst rate is about 5 bursts/day.\n\n5.3.\n\nBurst Fluence\n\nProbably the most easily observed property of bursts is the total fluence, EH + EHe ,\nresulting from burning the fuel in the accreted layer. We assume that all of the unburnt\nhydrogen and helium in the accreted layer is fully burned to iron in the burst and radiated\nduring the burst (neglecting any flux going into the star or any energy loss through neutrino\nemission). We then divide the burst fluence by the Eddington luminosity to calculate an\neffective burst duration:\nEH + EHe\n.\n(34)\ntH+He =\nLEdd\nThis quantity is plotted in Fig. 13 for our standard three neutron star radii and four core\ntemperatures. As in the case of the recurrence times discussed above, the calculated values\nare upper limits because of the assumption of complete burning of the fuel.\nSince hydrogen burning is typically beta-limited during the burst, the hydrogen fluence\nmay in some cases emerge as a long plateau following the initial spike of helium burning\n(which is not beta-limited). Therefore, another possibly useful measure of burst duration is\nthe effective duration tHe of helium burning alone, calculated again as fluence divided by the\nEddington luminosity. This quantity is plotted in Fig. 14.\nConsider first the regime of helium bursts, which corresponds to the segments of tH+He\nand tHe with steep negative slopes in the range log(lacc ) \u223c \u22121.5 to \u22122.5. These are delayed\nbursts in which the hydrogen burns stably at a shallow depth, while the helium accumulates\nover a fairly large column before the system goes unstable. The bursts are very much\ndominated by helium burning (see Fig. 5), and so tH+He and tHe are nearly equal. Also, the\nfluence is directly proportional to the accretion column \u03a3layer , as can be seen by comparison\n\n\f\u2013 38 \u2013\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n4\n\n4\n\n2\n\n2\n\n0\n\n0\n\n4\n\n4\n\n2\n\n2\n\n0\n\n0\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\nFig. 13.- Effective burst duration, calculated by dividing the total burst fluence by the\nEddington luminosity. Triangles, circles and stars correspond to neutron star radii of 16.4 km,\n10.4 km and 6.5 km respectively. Notice that, at the extreme right of the various panels,\nwhere we have the regime of delayed mixed bursts, the burst duration is either level or falls\nrelative to the prompt mixed bursts, even though the recurrence time trec (Fig. 11) and\nthe layer thickness \u03a3layer,crit (Fig. 12) increase substantially. This indicates that there is\nconsiderable steady burning of nuclear fuel in this regime.\n\n\f\u2013 39 \u2013\nwith Fig. 12.\nThere are two segments of prompt bursts, one at higher luminosities and the other at\nlower luminosities, on either side of the helium bursts. Both involve significant unburnt\nhydrogen and helium, and therefore for both tH+He is significantly greater than tHe (since\nhydrogen burning releases more energy per gram, by a factor of about 5, compared to\nhelium burning). Both burst durations are roughly proportional to \u03a3layer as can be seen by\ncomparison with Fig. 12.\nFinally, the delayed mixed bursts, which are present for log(lacc ) > \u22121, show a different\nbehavior. These are systems in which considerable stable burning of nuclear fuel occurs in\nthe accreted layer before the layer actually bursts. Therefore, the amount of nuclear fuel\navailable to power the burst is much less than one might expect for the given column depth.\nThe burst durations are at most comparable to, and are often less than, the durations of\nadjacent prompt bursts, even though these delayed bursts have larger values of \u03a3layer and\ncorrespondingly much longer recurrence times (compare Figs. 13, 14 with Fig. 12).\nFrom Figs. 13, 14 we see that the typical burst durations are predicted to be a few\nseconds to few tens of seconds at high mass accretion rates. However, the duration can be\nquite large, an hour or longer, for helium bursts with log(lacc ) . \u22122, and as much as a day\nfor cooler core temperatures.\n\n5.4.\n\nBurst \u03b1\n\nThe recurrence times and burst durations discussed in the previous subsections were\ncalculated assuming that the entire fuel reservoir is consumed in a burst. However, this\nassumption may not be valid (e.g. Taam 1982; Fujimoto et al. 1987b), especially for cold\nneutron stars (Taam et al. 1993). It is, therefore, useful to consider the ratio \u03b1 of the nuclearburning energy that is emitted during the burst to the total energy released between bursts\nby accretion. In terms of quantities we have introduced earlier, \u03b1 is given by\n\u03b1\u2261\n\ntrec Lacc\ntrec\n=\nlacc .\nEH + EHe\ntH+He\n\n(35)\n\nThe quantity \u03b1 should be independent of what fraction of the fuel is burned in bursts; if only\na fraction of the fuel is burned, then both trec and tH+He will decrease by the same fraction\nand \u03b1 ought to remain the same. This makes it a particularly useful parameter.\nFig. 15 shows \u03b1 from our models for several neutron star radii and core temperatures,\nand a range of accretion rates. Two trends are obvious. First, more compact neutron stars\nhave larger values of \u03b1 compared to less compact stars; the former release more gravitational\n\n\f\u2013 40 \u2013\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n4\n\n4\n\n3\n\n3\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n4\n\n4\n\n3\n\n3\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n-3\n\nFig. 14.- Similar to Fig. 13, but for only helium burning.\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n\f\u2013 41 \u2013\nenergy per unit accreted mass compared to the latter, whereas both release roughly the same\namount of nuclear energy in bursts. Second, prompt bursts tend to have smaller values of\n\u03b1 compared to delayed bursts. Generally, prompt bursts have a lot of unburnt hydrogen\navailable. This gives a larger burst fluence per unit mass and thus a smaller \u03b1. The delayed\nhelium bursts have very little hydrogen. Since helium burning releases a factor of about 5\nless energy per gram, the \u03b1 of these bursts is larger by about this factor. The increase of \u03b1\nfor the delayed mixed bursts at log(lacc ) > \u22121 is for a different reason. Here, the accreting\nlayer has both hydrogen and helium, but both fuels are burned substantially before the burst\nis initiated. This is the reason for the upturn of \u03b1 at the highest accretion rates in all the\npanels in Fig. 15. This trend has not been noted in previous work.\n\n5.5.\n\nConstraints on Neutrino Cooling\n\nIf we assume that the neutron star is in thermal equilibrium as it accretes we may\nestimate the temperature of its core as a function of its mean accretion rate. There are\ntwo contributions to energy flowing into the core. The first is the inward flux at the inner\nboundary of the accreted layer and the substrate; this may be either positive or negative\n(see Brown 2000). The second is the energy of released by nuclear reactions deep in the\ncrust (Brown et al. 1998), typically \u223c 1 MeV/baryon. Our calculations show that the\nformer contribution is much smaller than the latter; this is consistent with the discussion in\nCumming & Bildsten (2000) where the authors estimate that, out of the 1 MeV per baryon\nreleased by deep crustal nuclear reactions, only about 150 keV per baryon escapes to the\nsurface. Therefore, for an approximate estimate of the core temperature, it is reasonable\nto assume that the flux flowing into the core is equal to 1 MeV/baryon (see Brown 2000\nfor a more detailed discussion including the effect of different assumptions on the thermal\nconductivity). If we further assume the simple estimates of the neutrino emissivity given in\nShapiro & Teukolsky (1983), we may estimate the equilibrium temperature of the core for a\ngiven accretion rate. For the modified URCA process we find\n\u0012\n\u00138\n\u00131/3\n\u0012\nTcore\n(1 + z)2 \u1e40\nEDH\n\u03c1\n= 2500\n,\n(36)\n108 K\n1MeV/baryon\nz\n\u1e40Edd \u03c1nuc\nwhich gives a typical temperature in the range (1 \u2212 3) \u00d7 108 K.

Notice the\nsteep rise of \u03b1 at high accretion luminosities, near the stable burning limit. The rise is\ncharacteristic of delayed mixed bursts.\n\n\f\u2013 43 \u2013\nrespectively) and on the exact flux flowing into the core (whether it is 1 MeV per baryon or\na little more or less.)\nAn important caveat is that our results for cool neutron stars with Tcore \u223c 107 K depend\nsomewhat sensitively on how we treat the inner boundary condition (see \u00a72.2), so the bursting\nbehavior of stars with direct URCA cooling may not be precisely as depicted by our results\nfor 107 K; however, it should be noticeably different from that of stars with modified URCA\ncooling.\n\n6.\n\nDiscussion\n\nWe begin in \u00a76.1 with a brief summary of how the results depend on the input physics.\nWe follow that in \u00a76.2 with a discussion of different kinds of modes present in our model\nand use this to explain the occurrence of delayed mixed bursts. In \u00a76.3, we discuss how our\nmethods compare with the many previous theoretical analyses of Type I bursts in neutron\nstars. We then present in \u00a76.4 a preliminary comparison of our theoretical predictions with\nobservations, making extensive use of the review of EXOSAT data published by van Paradijs\net al. (1988). We defer a detailed comparision with more recent observations with the Rossi\nX-ray Timing Explorer and BeppoSAX to a subsequent paper, but briefly touch on the work\nof Cornelisse et al. (2003). (The latter paper was posted after our paper was submitted\nto the journal. Since their results are very relevant for this work, we have included some\ndiscussion.) Finally, in \u00a76.5, we discuss some improvements to this work that may be worth\npursuing.\n\n6.1.\n\nSensitivity to Input Physics\n\nIn the course of doing this work, we changed several prescriptions for the input physics,\nusually starting with a simple approximation and graduating later to more realistic prescriptions. By monitoring how the results changed we have developed a sense of which aspects\nof the input physics are most important if one is interested in accurate results.\nIn the equation of state, the only complication is the electron pressure. Before settling\non the quadrature prescription given in equation (22), which is taken from Paczynski (1983b),\nwe tried a simpler prescription in which we wrote the electron pressure as the straight sum\nof Pe,nd and Pe,d . The differences in the results are insignificant. Similarly, we tried modeling\nthe nuclear reactions both with and without screening. There was little difference, except\nperhaps at the lowest accretion rates, log(lacc ) \u223c \u22123, where the hydrogen bursts showed\n\n\f\u2013 44 \u2013\nsome small variations.\nThe effect of changing the opacity prescriptions is more serious. For instance, the\nopacities of Hernquist & Applegate (1984), which we tried first, are generally lower than\nthose of Potekhin (1999). Therefore, with the former, a thicker layer must accumulate\nbefore the layer becomes unstable. This effect is strongest for the hydrogen bursts, and\nyields longer recurrence times and larger fluences. Also, because the burning layer is more\npoorly insulated from the core, the results tend to be more sensitive to the core temperature\nthan when we use the modern conductive opacities of Potekhin (1999). As a result, with the\nHernquist & Applegate (1984) opacities we find that models with Tcore = 107.5 K are more\nsimilar to models with Tcore = 107 K, whereas with the Potekhin (1999) opacities, they are\nmore similar to 108 K.\nThe results are even more sensitive to the radiative opacity prescription. Prior to\nsettling on the Schatz et al. (1999) prescription, we employed the simple fitting function\nof Iben (1975). The results were qualitatively the same as the ones presented here, except\nthat the boundaries between the different regimes moved towards lower values of log(lacc ) by\nabout 0.2. That is, the patterns in Figs. 5, 10\u201315 were shifted to the left by this amount,\nbut not altered very much in shape. In view of this, it may be worthwhile to incorporate an\neven better approximation for the radiative opacity in future calcualtions.\nThe frequencies and structure of the unstable modes are not changed significantly by\nthe opacity with the exception that the modes penetrate deeper into the substrate for lower\nopacities.\nFinally, we have found that the inner boundary condition plays an important role.\nFigure 16(a) shows two sets of calculations, both of which set the temperature equal to Tcore\nat the inner boundary. In one case, the matching is done inside the substrate at a depth \u03a3diff\ndetermined by a diffusion criterion (see \u00a72.2 and eq. 18 for details), while in the other the\nboundary condition is set at \u03a3layer , the bottom of the accreted layer. There is an enormous\ndifference in the results. In the former case, which is more physical, the temperature of the\naccreted layer tends to remain high and the temperature profile relaxes to Tcore only well\ninside the star. In the latter case, however, the boundary condition forces the gas layer to be\ncool near the bottom and this causes the rest of the layer to be cooler than in the previous\ncase. The lower temperature delays the onset of nuclear burning, causing the critical surface\ndensity for instability to go up significantly.\nWe feel that we have captured a good fraction of the important physics with the boundary condition that we use. Nevertheless, there is probably room for further improvement.\n\n\f\u2013 45 \u2013\n\nFig. 16.- Results for Tcore = 108 K, R = 10.4 km, M = 1.4M\u2299 . (a) Shows how the\nrestriction to thermal modes (filled circles) affects the results. Compared to the full instability\ncalculation (open circles), only a fraction of the range of lacc is found to be unstable for purely\nthermal perturbations. The results depicted by crosses use the instability criterion of Fushiki\n& Lamb (1987a). The lower set of circles corresponds to our standard boundary condition\nin which the temperature boundary condition is applied inside the star at a diffusion depth.\nThe upper set of circles depicts the results if the temperature boundary condition is applied\nat the bottom of the fuel layer [as in Narayan & Heyl (2002) and Fushiki & Lamb (1987a)].\n(b) Shows how the choice of gmode affects the onset of instability. The larger the value of\ngmode , the more the nuclear modes near the right end of the plot are delayed. The thermal\nmodes on the left are hardly affected.\n\n\f\u2013 46 \u2013\n6.2.\n\nThermal Modes, Nuclear Modes, and Delayed Mixed Bursts\n\nBecause the eigenmodes and growth rates are calculated by perturbing five coupled\ndifferential equations, the physics of the modes is not always apparent. We make a beginning\nhere by sorting the modes into two major classes.\nTo understand the division, we note that the perturbation equations written in Appendix\nA involve three time derivatives, one each in the energy equation (A10), the H-evolution\nequation (A6) and the He-evolution equation (A12). The characteristic time scale of the\nenergy equation is something like the diffusion time, which is usually quite short, whereas\nthe characteristic time scale of the other two equations is the accretion time, since this is the\ntime on which the composition of a parcel of gas changes. We thus expect fast-growing modes\nto mostly involve the the energy equation (plus the equations of hydrostatic equilibrium and\nenergy transfer which do not involve time derivatives), while slower modes should involve\nsignificant perturbations in all variables, including X and Y . We refer to the former as\n\"thermal modes\" and the latter as \"nuclear modes.\"\nIt is straightforward to filter out the nuclear modes in the calculations - we just switch\noff perturbations in X and Y by setting X(\u03a3) = X0 (\u03a3), Y (\u03a3) = Y0 (\u03a3), or equivalently,\nX1 (\u03a3) = Y1 (\u03a3) = 0. Figure 16(a) shows the results of such a calculation. Compared to our\nstandard calculation in which all variables are allowed to vary (open circles), we see that\nthermal modes (filled circles) are present only for lower accretion rates, log(lacc ) < \u22121.5, i.e.,\nin the regime of helium bursts and hydrogen bursts, but not at higher accretion rates where\nmixed bursts occur. An inspection of the mode growth rates confirms that these modes grow\non relatively short time scales; typically, the growth time for thermal modes is a factor of\ntens to hundreds shorter than the accretion time scale. The modes above log(lacc ) \u223c \u22121.5,\nwhich are present only when all variables are allowed to vary, are the nuclear modes in our\nclassification. These modes have slow time scales, and their eigenfunctions involve important\nfluctuations in composition, which is not the case with the thermal modes. The eigenfunction\nshown in Figs. 8, 9 is a nuclear mode.\nThe identification of the slow nuclear modes provides a natural explanation for the\ncategory of delayed mixed bursts that we have newly identified in this paper. Recall that we\ndo not consider a system to be unstable unless the growth rate R(\u03b3) is greater than gmode \u03b3acc\n(see eq. 21). For our nominal choice of gmode = 3, the thermal modes are not in the least\naffected by the value of gmode , since their growth rates are typically much greater than the\nlimit. However, the slower nuclear modes are strongly influenced by the criterion, and the\neffect is particularly severe at higher accretion rates. The right panel of Figure 16 shows the\ncritical column for bursts \u03a3layer,crit as a function of log(lacc ) for different choices of gmode . The\ndelayed burst regime becomes more and more prominent as gmode increases. The calculations\n\n\f\u2013 47 \u2013\nshow that, for high accretion rates, the accreted layer is marginally unstable already at small\nvalues of \u03a3layer . However, the growth rate is low, and the instability takes a while to grow.\nBy the time the mode has grown enough to produce a burst, \u03a3layer is significantly larger;\nthis is the reason for the delay in the burst. In addition, because of the delay, much of the\nfuel is burned stably prior to the burst, and the amount of unburnt fuel available for the\nburst is reduced. This causes a dramatic increase of \u03b1 in this regime. The extent of these\neffects depends on the choice of gmode . The value we have used for the results presented in\n\u00a75, gmode = 3, are in our opinion reasonable.\n\n6.3.\n\nComparison with Earlier Theoretical Work\n\nPrevious investigations have identified the various burning regimes that we have found\nhere (Fujimoto et al. 1981; Fushiki & Lamb 1987a; Bildsten 2000), with the exception of the\nregime of delayed mixed bursts (see \u00a74.3, Tables 2, 3, Fig. 10). The ranges of lacc of the\ndifferent regimes obtained by these workers generally agree with our results, though we have\nfound several new features, as discussed in previous sections. Our method, being more rigorous, promises to provide better quantitative predictions for comparison with observations.\nAlso, we calculate mode frequencies, which enables us to identify overstable modes and to\nestimate the oscillation periods. It is unclear if this will have clear observational signatures,\nbut it is a topic worthy of further investigation.\nAs described in \u00a71, our method is similar in spirit to previous investigations that evaluated steady-state configurations and then studied the stability of the equilibria to small\nperturbations (for example Hansen & van Horn 1975; Ergma & Tutukov 1980; Fujimoto\net al. 1981; Fushiki & Lamb 1987a; Cumming & Bildsten 2000). The computation of the\nequilibria in the various studies probably do not differ a great deal since the physics is basically well understood (\u00a72). The approximations that we and others use (\u00a72.3) appear to\nbe harmless, except perhaps the opacity which does make a difference (\u00a76.1). Once one\nhas calculated a sequence of equilibria such as those shown in Figs. 2, 3, it is necessary to\ndetermine at what \u03a3layer,crit , if any, the accreted layer becomes unstable. It is at this stage\nthat the major differences in methods appears.\nThe technique that we have used in this paper is new and avoids any prejudices as to\nwhich processes are important and which are not for triggering a burst. We carry out a full\nlinear stability analysis of the equilibrium solution by solving for the eigenmodes and their\ncomplex eigenfrequencies. In particular, the regime of delayed mixed bursts that we have\nfound (\u00a74.3, Tables 2, 3), and the identification of nuclear modes (\u00a76.2), are entirely the result\nof the more rigorous formalism we employ. As we shall see below, the delayed mixed burst\n\n\f\u2013 48 \u2013\nregime may help to explain some puzzling observations. Also, none of the previous studies\nwas able to identify whether the growing mode is a simple instability or an overstability.\nThis too may have some observational implications.\nEarlier works have generally used various local or approximately global criteria, calculated at or near the bottom of the layer, to determine the stability of the accreted layer.\nWith the exception of Fushiki & Lamb (1987a), no one to our knowledge has discussed global\nperturbations of the steady-state configuration. Even the Fushiki & Lamb (1987a) study was\nrelatively crude since it assumed a constant temperature perturbation as a function of depth\nand did not treat perturbations in the substrate below the layer. In contrast, our approach\ninvolves a computation of the entire eigenfunction from first principles, without any preconceptions as to the shape of the mode, and allows for perturbations in the substrate. It\nshould be emphasized that we consider perturbations in all variables, including the composition parameters X, Y and Z (= 1 \u2212 X \u2212 Y ). This enables us to find both thermal modes\nand nuclear modes (\u00a76.2). In contrast, all previous studies restricted themselves to thermal\nperturbations, that too approximately, and thus were sensitive only to thermal modes.\nTo get some sense of how good the approximate criteria of the past are, we present\nhere some quantitative comparisons with two methods described in the literature, those of\nFushiki & Lamb (1987a) and Cumming & Bildsten (2000). These papers use two different\ncriteria for the onset of instability. Both express the criterion as\nd\u01ebheat\nd\u01ebcool\n>\n,\ndT\ndT\n\n(38)\n\nbut differ in their definitions of the quantities. Fushiki & Lamb (1987a) define \u01ebheat to be\nthe total nuclear energy generation rate while Cumming & Bildsten (2000) define it to be\n1.9 times the energy generation rate from the triple-alpha reacton. In order to include the\nhydrogen bursts in the latter calculation we generalized it by adding also the hydrogen energy\ngeneration rate. The differences in the cooling rates in the two approaches are more striking.\nFushiki & Lamb (1987a) asume that dT1 /d\u03a3 = 0 and use a formula that is equivalent to\n(this is our best guess since their paper does not explain in sufficient detail)\n\u0012 \u0013\nd\u01ebcool\nd ln K\nd dF\nd2 ln K\n=\n=\n\u01eb\u2212\nF,\n(39)\ndT\ndT d\u03a3\ndT\ndT d\u03a3\nwhere \u01eb is the total energy generation rate and K = 16\u03c3T 3/3\u03ba is the thermal conductivity\n(see eq. 4). Cumming & Bildsten (2000), on the other hand, start from the work of Fujimoto\net al. (1981) and write approximately\n\u0012\n\u0013\nacT 4\nd\nd\u01ebcool\n,\n(40)\n=\ndT\ndT 3\u03ba\u03a32\n\n\f\u2013 49 \u2013\nwhere the quantity on the right is roughly the thermal energy density divided by the diffusion time to the surface. Clearly both criteria are approximate. Both are also local since\nthey focus on values at a particular depth. The Fushiki & Lamb (1987a) method could be\ngeneralized to an approximate global criterion (it is possible that the authors did make such\na generalization, but we have not been able to understand exactly how they might have done\nit). We limit ourselves to the local version given above. The Cumming & Bildsten (2000)\ncriterion is of a mixed kind, since it compares a local quantity for the heating rate to a\npseudo-global quantity for the cooling rate.\nWe use the equilibria as computed with our code using our particular prescriptions for\nopacity, equation of state, etc. (\u00a72.3) for all the calculations. We thereby ensure a fair\ncomparison of the different methods. We consider the calculations done with our full linear\nperturbation analysis as the \"correct\" answer. Indeed, since the two approximate criteria\ndescribed above are both restricted to thermal perturbations, we feel that the \"correct\"\nanswer is the set of thermal modes calculated with our perturbation analysis (filled circles\nin Figs. 16 and 17).\nFigure 16(a) shows results corresponding to a temperature boundary condition, with the\ncrosses depicting the results obtained with the Fushiki & Lamb (1987a) criterion. For the\nlatter, we applied the local criterion (38), (39) at the temperature maximum in the accreted\nlayer. (By choosing this point rather than the bottom of the layer, we feel that the method\nhas a better chance of approximating the true global problem.) The agreement between the\napproximate criterion and our full calculations (thermal plus nuclear modes) is quite good.\nThe Fushiki & Lamb (1987a) criterion finds a smaller range of lacc for the helium bursts and\noverestimates the range of the hydrogen bursts. Also, not surprisingly, it does not find the\ndelayed mixed burst regime. The most surprising result is that the method, which is overtly\nlimited to thermal perturbations, finds modes well outside the range of thermal modes. This\nmay be viewed either as a serious error in the method or as an unexpected strength!\nFigure 17 shows the corresponding comparison for the Cumming & Bildsten (2000) criterion. Since these authors use a flux inner boundary condition, we calculated the equilibria\nas well as our stability results for this boundary condition, assuming an outward flux of 150\nkeV per accreted baryon at the bottom of the accretion layer. In the stability analysis we\nassumed that the perturbed flux is zero at the bottom of the layer (which corresponds to a\nnon-zero temperature perturbation). Once again, we should view the thermal modes (filled\ncircles) as the \"correct\" answers. The crosses show the range of instability according to\nthe criterion (38), (40) applied at the bottom of the accreted layer (where the temperature\nreaches a maximum). Wherever the Cumming & Bildsten (2000) criterion indicates that\nthere is an instability, the agreement in the value of \u03a3layer,crit is fairly good. However, the\n\n\f\u2013 50 \u2013\n\nFig. 17.- Models for log R/Rs = 0.4 and M = 1.4M\u2299 with a flux inner boundary condition.\nIt is assumed that a constant flux of 150 keV per accreted baryon flows out of the star into\nthe accretion layer. The open circles correspond to the full calculation where all variables are\nperturbed, and the filled circles to a calculation in which the composition is not allowed to\nvary (thermal modes). The crosses trace the results corresponding to the instability criterion\nof Cumming & Bildsten (2000).\n\n\f\u2013 51 \u2013\nmethod appears to miss finding an instability over a fairly wide range of lacc . Also, naturally,\nthe method does not reproduce the delayed mixed bursts (which we have identified as an\neffect associated with nuclear modes).\nOne comment is in order. In calculating the above results for the Fushiki & Lamb\n(1987a) and Cumming & Bildsten (2000) criteria, we followed the philosophy described in\n\u00a73, namely to label a system unstable only if it has unstable configurations on the \"wall\" of\nthe S-curve for values of \u03a3layer above the hydrogen and helium peaks. Thus, a situation like\nFig. 2(a) in which the wall solutions are all stable is considered stable, even though there\nare unstable solutions on the trailing slope of the helium peak. We do not know if the other\nauthors used this criterion or not, but we believe it is the correct approach to the problem\n(for reasons discussed in \u00a73).\nIn summary, the two approximate criteria discussed above are useful for quick estimates,\nbut are not appropriate for detailed quantitative results. For the latter, one needs to do a full\nlinear stability analysis, as presented in this paper, or carry out time-dependent simulations\nof the kind reviewed in \u00a71.\nThe good news is that, in the regions where both our and previous work have found\ninstability, the results agree quantitatively quite well. Specifically, the results presented by\nFujimoto et al. (1987b) agree in detail with the equilibrium curve presented in Fig. 4(a). For\nlow accretion rates and cool cores, Hanawa & Fujimoto (1986) and Fujimoto et al. (1987a)\nfound very long X-ray bursts with durations similar to those shown in Fig. 13. We also find\ngood qualitative agreement with the more comprehensive results of Fushiki & Lamb (1987a)\nand the different burning regimes that they have identified, and quantitative agreement\nwith the tabulated column densities and temperatures in Table 2 of Cumming & Bildsten\n(2000). However, the overarching nature of the calculations presented here make it difficult\nto compare very precisely with earlier work which were generally focused on understanding\nspecific ignition criteria, rather than presenting predictions of the gross properties of Type I\nbursts over a wide range of accretion rates, temperatures and stellar radii.\n\n6.4.\n\nComparison with Observations\n6.4.1. Stable Burning Limit\n\nVan Paradijs et al. (1988) have collected together a body of burst data obtained with\nthe EXOSAT satellite. They define a quantity \u03b3 to be the ratio of the observed persistent\nflux Fp to the net peak flux Fre , not including the persistent emission, of bursts with radius\n\u2032\nexpansion. The quantity Fp is proportional to Lacc , while Fre is proportional to LEdd , where\n\n\f\u2013 52 \u2013\n\u2032\n\nLEdd is the Eddington luminosity in the frame of the neutron star surface and is smaller\nthan our LEdd (defined at infinity) by a redshift factor. Thus, \u03b3 is larger than Lacc /LEdd by\na variable factor that may be \u223c 1.5. Van Paradijs et al. (1988) find that bursts occur for\nlog \u03b3 . \u22120.5; sources with \u03b3 above this limit apparently burn fuel stably without bursting.\nThe observational limit they have obtained on \u03b3 should be compared with our prediction\nthat bursts occur only below log(Lacc /LEdd ) \u223c \u22120.7 to \u22120.6 (\u00a74.3). The agreement is fairly\ngood. In a previous paper (Narayan & Heyl 2002), we found that bursts should occur up\nto log(lacc ) \u223c \u22120.5. However, those calculations were done with a less sophisticated inner\nboundary condition (see \u00a72.2).\nThe brightest low-mass X-ray binaries generally do not show burst activity. Matsuba et\nal. (1995) saw Type I bursts from the bright source GX 13+1 when \u03b3 \u223c 0.3, Kuulkers & van\nder Klis (2000) saw a radius-expansion burst from the source GX 3+1 when the persistent\nluminosity was 0.17LEdd , and Kuulkers, van der Klis & van Paradijs (1995) and Smale (1998)\nobserved bursts from Cyg X\u20132 with \u03b3 as large as 0.74. Tournear et al. (2003) have recently\nused the USA satellite to carry out long-duration observations of a number of neutron star\nsystems. They observed bursts from sources with a range of lacc extending up to \u223c 0.3.\nFinally, Cornelisse et al. (2003) find that bursts cease at a luminosity of 5.5 \u00d7 1037 erg s\u22121 ,\nwhich corresponds again to 0.3LEdd (for M = 1.4M\u2299 and our definition of the Eddington\nluminosity). These observations are all generally consistent with the van Paradijs et al.\n(1988) results. The stable limit according to our model is encouragingly close to the data,\nwhich is noteworthy since our model is a first-principles calculation with no free parameters.\n\n6.4.2. Burst \u03b1\nAs mentioned in \u00a75.4, both the predicted recurrence time and the fluence of bursts\nare subject to an uncertainty over whether the entire reservoir of fuel is consumed during\nthe burst. Only fully time-dependent calculations can predict what fraction of the fuel is\nconsumed in the burst, and even then probably only with multi-dimensional simulations.\nThis is well beyond the scope of our calculation. However, partial burning affects the recurrence time and the burst fluence in an identical fashion, and therefore their ratio should be\ninsensitive to this uncertainty. The parameter \u03b1 defined in \u00a75.4 is such a quantity.\nVan Paradijs et al. (1988) present results for \u03b1 as a function of \u03b3. Fig. 18 compares\ntheir data with our predictions. In plotting the data, we have assumed that the observed \u03b3 is\nequal to lacc . As discussed in \u00a76.4.1, the two may differ by a few tens of percent (because of\ngravitational redshift), so the data may need to be shifted to the left by this amount. Allowing\nfor this uncertainty, we find that the data agree with the model predictions fairly well for\n\n\f\u2013 53 \u2013\n\n-2\n\n-1.5\n\n-1\n\n-0.5\n\n-2\n\n-1.5\n\n-1\n\n-0.5\n\n4\n\n4\n\n3\n\n3\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n4\n\n4\n\n3\n\n3\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n-2\n\n-1.5\n\n-1\n\n-0.5\n\n-2\n\n-1.5\n\n-1\n\n-0.5\n\nFig. 18.- A comparison of the model predictions for \u03b1 with the observational data presented\nin van Paradijs et al. (1988). The circles show the data. The lines in each panel correspond\nto the model results shown in Fig. 15, with the symbols replaced by connected lines. In each\npanel, the uppermost line corresponds to a neutron star radius of 6.5 km, the middle line to\n10.4 km, and the lowest line to 16.4 km.\n\n\f\u2013 54 \u2013\nluminosities above log(lacc ) \u223c \u22121.5. For accretion luminosities in the range log(lacc ) \u223c \u22121.5\nto \u22121, the data give \u03b1 \u223c 102 . This value is roughly consistent with our model predictions\nfor smaller neutron star radii (6.5 km and 10.4 km); the largest radius we have tried (16.4\nkm) does not agree very well with the data.\nThe most interesting feature of the data is that, for higher accretion luminosities, \u03b1\nshoots up to values \u223c 103 . Van Paradijs et al. (1988) suggested that the increase is because\nmuch of the nuclear energy in the accumulating fuel is released before the configuration\nbecomes unstable, i.e. between bursts during accretion. The regime of increased \u03b1 in the\ndata very nicely coincides with the regime of delayed mixed bursts in our models. Indeed,\nin this regime, much of the nuclear fuel does burn steadily, as suggested by van Paradijs\net al. (1988), and it is only after a considerable surface density has accreted that the burst\nis initiated. Correspondingly, \u03b1 goes up by a large factor. According to our models, in this\nregime, the critical \u03a3layer,crit to initiate a burst increases (Fig. 12), as does the recurrence time\nbetween bursts (Fig. 11), whereas the burst fluence as measured by tH+He is either unchanged\nor goes down (Fig. 13). All of these features are consistent with the observations, and this\nis one of the successes of the present work.\nThe sudden \"break\" from values of \u03b1 \u223c 100 to larger values occurs at log(lacc ) \u223c \u22121\nin the van Paradijs et al. (1988) data, though the precise location is hard to determine.\nA similar break has been seen in recent data presented by Cornelisse et al. (2003) who\nquote a break luminosity of 2.1 \u00d7 1037 erg s\u22121 (they actually present data for burst rates\nand burst durations, but it is straightforward to translate these to \u03b1). In our units, their\nbreak occurs at log(lacc ) = \u22120.9, which is close to where we find a break in our models. This\nquantitative agreement is very encouraging. Cornelisse et al. (2003) interpret the break in\nterms of a transition from unstable to stable hydrogen burning, even though such a transition\nis expected to occur at very low luminosities, not at log(lacc ) \u223c \u22121, and it does not predict\nthe particular behavior seen in the data. In our model, the break signals the switch from\nthe regime of prompt mixed bursts to that of delayed mixed bursts. Both the position of the\nbreak and the signatures we predict are in encouraging agreement with the observations.\nAt low accretion luminosities \u223c 0.01LEdd , van Paradijs et al. (1988) find very low values\nof \u03b1 \u223c 10. We are unable to reproduce this trend and are not aware of any other studies that\nsucceed. Our models predict an increase in \u03b1 as we move into the regime of helium bursts\n(where there is little or no hydrogen to burn), which is just the opposite of what is seen in\nthe data. It would be useful to probe this regime in more detail with modern observations.\n\n\f\u2013 55 \u2013\n\n-2\n\n-1.5\n\n-1\n\n-0.5\n\n-2\n\n-1.5\n\n-1\n\n-0.5\n\n3\n\n3\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n3\n\n3\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1\n\n1\n\n-2\n\n-1.5\n\n-1\n\n-0.5\n\n-2\n\n-1.5\n\n-1\n\n-0.5\n\nFig. 19.- A comparison of the model burst durations tH+He with the corresponding data\npresented in van Paradijs et al.

Recurrence Time\nThe results on trec in Fig. 11 show a variety of patterns that could be tested against\nobservations, but we are not aware of appropriate data in the literature. Continuous monitoring of sources, e.g., the recent work of Tournear et al. (2003) and Cornelisse et al. (2003),\nwould be very useful in this regard. The latter paper finds that the peak burst rate in several\nsources is about 10 bursts per day, corresponding to a recurrence time of about 2.5 hours.\n(They also see sources with a peak burst rate of 2.5 per day, but these seem to belong to\na separate class.) In our model, the shortest recurrence time is about 5 hours (Fig. 11),\ncorresponding to a burst rate of about 5 bursts per day; this particular rate is found for\nsmaller neutron star radii (6.5 km and 10.4 km) at the break point between the prompt\nmixed bursts and delayed mixed bursts at log(lacc ) \u223c \u22121. The location of the peak is in\ngood agreement with the observations, but there is a factor of 2 discrepancy in the maximum\nburst rate. The latter may indicate that some of the approximations we have made (e.g.,\nthe opacity or the inner boundary condition) are still inadequate. It might also indicate that\nonly a fraction of the fuel is burned during the burst.\nThe observations of Cornelisse et al. (2003) indicate in a few sources that the burst rate\ndecreases proportional to the luminosity below the break point (e.g., GX 354\u20130 in their Fig.\n\u22121\n2); equivalently, their recurrence times vary inversely as trec \u221d lacc\n. Such a trend corresponds\nto a constant value of \u03a3layer,crit , and arises naturally in our model (and in other models, e.g.,\nsee Figs. 16, 17). Among the models we have calculated, it appears that smaller stellar radii\n(6.5 km, 10.4 km) are more consistent with the observed trend than larger radii (16.4 km).\nAlso, of the four core temperatures we have tried, we find best agreement with the data for\nthe hotter temperatures 107.5, 108 , 108.5 K. A core temperature of 107 K appears unlikely.\nAbove the break, Cornelisse et al. (2003) find a decrease in the burst rate by a factor 4.\nThis is consistent with the increase in trec seen in the models. Another interesting feature\nto check would be the sudden increase of trec with decreasing lacc in the helium burst regime\n(lacc < \u22121.5). This regime has regions of very long recurrence times, which for all practical\npurposes may be considered burst-stable since observations are unlikely to detect these very\nrare bursts. We thus predict a \"gap\" in the occurrence of bursts for accretion luminosities\nin the vicinity of \u223c 10\u22122 LEdd (Narayan & Heyl 2002). It is not that there are no bursts\nhere, but that bursts are very rare and correspondingly very luminous (Fig. 13). It is not\nclear that the helium burst regime has been seen in the observations, or that there is a gap.\nIndeed, the van Paradijs et al. (1988) give anomalously low values of \u03b1 here, whereas helium\nbursts should have large values of \u03b1.\n\n\f\u2013 57 \u2013\n6.4.4. Burst Fluence\nFigure 19 compares observed burst durations \u03c4 from the van Paradijs et al. (1988)\ncompilation with our model predictions for the Eddington-scaled duration tH+He . We see\nthat the predicted durations are generally larger than the observed ones, though the models\nwith a stellar radius of 6.5 km (the lowest lines in the panels) come pretty close. As in\nthe case of the recurrence time, this comparison again is compromised by the possibility\nof partial burning of the fuel. Modulo this caveat, we conclude once again that somewhat\nhotter cores Tcore & 107.5 K and smaller neutron star radii R . 10 km are preferred.\nOne interesting feature in the models is that the burst duration drops by about a factor\nof 1.5\u20132 above the break point at log(lacc ) \u223c \u22121. This is precisely the same point at which\nthe burst recurrence time increases by a large factor. In the data presented by Cornelisse\net al. (2003), such a decrease in the burst durations is seen (it is less obvious in the van\nParadijs et al. data), but the amount of the decrease appears to be larger than we predict.\n\n6.4.5. Overstable Modes\nRevnivtsev et al. (2001) have reported a new class of low-frequency oscillations in burst\nsources that might be related to oscillatory behavior of the accreted layer prior to a burst.\nThe oscillations seem to be present for accretion luminosities of about a tenth Eddington,\nand the frequency is about 0.01 Hz.\nBecause our analysis computes the complex frequencies of unstable modes, it is natural\nto ask if we can explain the observed oscillations. The oscillations seem to be observed mostly\nin the regime that we have identified as delayed mixed bursts, above the break discussed in\nthe previous subsections. In this regime, we do find complex values of \u03b3 with the imaginary\nparts often larger than the real parts. However, our mode frequencies are generally lower\nthan the observed frequencies by a factor of 10 or more. We do not know if this is an\nindication that some of our input physics is inadequate (\u00a76.1) or perhaps that our numerical\ntechnique for finding eigenmodes is unable to converge on modes with very high frequencies\n(high compared to the accretion frequency \u03b3acc ). More work is needed. Alternatively, the\noscillations may be related to slow propagation of the burning front on the stellar surface\n(see Bildsten 1995).\n\n\f\u2013 58 \u2013\n6.5.\n\nFuture Prospects\n\nThe richness of the properties of nuclear burning on neutron stars as revealed by the\nab initio linear stability analysis presented here is remarkable. Considering the encouraging\nagreement that we find with observational data, the model deserves further exploration.\nSince we have used a variety of prescriptions for calculating the opacity, the equation of\nstate, the nuclear burning, etc., it might be useful to improve these aspects of the model.\nThe radiative free-free opacity in the outer layers seems to have a large effect (\u00a76.1), so this\nis one area that needs more work. The treatment of the inner boundary condition is also a\nserious issue that needs to be considered in greater detail, especially for cool neutron star\ncores (see \u00a72.2).\nOne simplification in the present calculations is that we consider only a limited number\nof reactions for H-burning and He-burning (\u00a72.3.3). At a sufficiently high temperature,\nbreakout from the hot CNO cycle is expected to occur and hydrogen will be burned via the\nrapid proton capture (rp) process (Wallace & Woosley 1982; Schatz et al. 1999). Figure\n5 of Schatz et al. (1999) shows the temperature limits above which the reaction rates\nfor processes such as 15 O(\u03b1, \u03b3)19Ne and 14 O(\u03b1, p)17F exceed the usual \u03b2-decay and proton\ncapture rates for these nuclei. We have confirmed that all the burst-unstable configurations\nwe have calculated in the present paper lie to the left of the corresponding lines in the Schatz\net al. plot. Hence, none of our burst results are affected by the neglect of these additional\nreactions. However, close to the Eddington accretion rate, where our model predicts that the\nsystems should be burst-stable, some of our equilibria cross into the zone where the breakout\nreactions, especially 15 O(\u03b1, \u03b3)19 Ne, become important. It is thus conceivable that some of\nthe very high \u1e40 configurations that we have identified as stable may turn out to be unstable\nwhen breakout reactions are included. This topic needs further investigation.\nIn terms of further calculations, the most obvious next step is to explore the effect\nof varying the composition of the accreting gas. Variations in metallicity between burst\nsources in globular clusters and those in the Galactic disk may possibly have observational\nconsequences. As a more extreme example, ultracompact binaries with degenerate helium\nsecondaries should have very different properties from the hydrogen-dominant systems we\nhave considered here. Obviously, without hydrogen, there will be no unstable hydrogen\nburning, so the hydrogen burst region will be missing from the results. Instead, we imagine\nthe helium burst regime will extend both to lower and higher accretion rates than in the\nresults presented in this paper. Because helium requires a higher temperature/density to\nignite, the bursts should occur more rarely than for hydrogen-accreting neutron stars.\nIn Narayan & Heyl (2002), we examined the burst properties of more massive primaries\n(black hole candidates) and found that the threshold for stable nuclear burning moves to a\n\n\f\u2013 59 \u2013\nhigher accretion rate. Hanawa & Fujimoto (1982) argue that the properties of the nuclear\nburning to lowest order are functions of the surface gravity and the mass accretion rate;\ntherefore, one can understand the mass dependence of burning regimes by keeping the mass\nfixed and varying the radius and accretion rate; specifically, increasing the mass of the primary shifts a diagram like Fig. 10 down and to the right which helps to account for the results\nof Narayan & Heyl (2002). Even though this argument gives a qualitative understanding of\nthe mass dependence of the burning regimes, serious quantitative applications requires the\nkind of detailed calculations we have presented here.\nRecently, a class of very long X-ray bursts has been discovered (Cornelisse et al. 2000;\nWijnands 2001) which have been interpreted as carbon-burning bursts (Taam & Picklum\n1978; Strohmayer 2000; Cumming & Bildsten 2001; Strohmayer & Brown 2002). In most\ncases, the bursts cannot be due to helium burning of a very thick layer since normal Type\nI bursts are seen at the same accretion rate, sometimes just before the superburst occurs.\nIt would be interesting to include carbon-burning physics in our model to see what kinds of\nbursts are predicted. It is worth noting, however, that not all long bursts necessarily arise\nfrom carbon-burning. As we see in Fig. 13, we predict very long helium and even hydrogen\nbursts at low accretion luminosities under appropriate conditions. Some of the observed long\nbursts (e.g., Gotthelf & Kulkarni 1997) may correspond to these.\nOn the observational front, there are numerous tests that one could envisage based on\nthe results shown in Figs. 10\u201315. The different regimes of bursting - delayed mixed bursts,\nprompt mixed bursts, helium bursts, hydrogen bursts - reveal very distinct patterns in\nvarious observables. If these patterns are seen in the data, then one might be able to\nconstrain the neutron star radius and/or the core temperature fairly well. This would have\nimportant implications for the neutron star equation of state and the nature of neutrino\ncooling in the core. We have made a beginning along these lines in this paper and have\nargued that perhaps Tcore is & 107.5 K and neutron star radii are . 10 km. More work along\nthese lines is worthwhile.\nIf we are to extend this model, which has been developed for neutron stars, to thermonuclear instabilities in accreting white dwarfs (classical novae), it would be necessary\nto include Coulomb corrections in the equation of state, a more accurate treatment of the\nsemi-degenerate regime, and more detailed radiative and conductive opacities. Understanding whether there is a regime of stable nuclear burning at high accretion rates onto a white\ndwarf is a key ingredient of any scenario in which Type Ia supernovae result from stable accretion of mass onto a white dwarf (Hillebrandt & Niemeyer 2000). Because classical novae\ntypically eject the material accreted along with some of the substrate, a regime of stable\nnuclear burning is required for accretion to cause the white dwarf to grow in mass and to\n\n\f\u2013 60 \u2013\nend up in a supernova. Unfortunately, our current prescriptions are too crude to treat this\nimportant burning regime accurately, but the potential of the technique for white dwarfs is\ntantalizing.\nFinally, the methods that we have described here have deliberately avoided examination\nof the physics of the burst itself, during which many complications arise, including other\nnuclear reaction channels, convection and hydrodynamics. An important question to examine\nis whether our techniques could be extended in any simple way to study the properties of\nthe bursts.\n\n7.\n\nSummary\n\nWe have presented a comprehensive treatment of the stability of nuclear burning on\nthe surface of neutron stars. For the first time, we have calculated the linearly unstable\neigenmodes of an accretion layer in quasi-steady state, making no ad hoc assumptions regarding the criterion for instability. The model reproduces the various previously known\nregimes of nuclear burning on neutron stars, and agrees with earlier results where there is\noverlap. Additionally, we have been able to probe in detail the behavior of accreting neutron\nstars at high mass accretion rates, near the threshold of stable nuclear burning. Here, we\nfind a hitherto unrecognized regime of delayed mixed bursts, with very distinct properties\ncompared to the more standard prompt mixed bursts.\nFor accretion rates greater than one percent of the Eddington rate, we find encouraging\nagreement between the model predictions and observations of bursts. The existence of the\nregime of delayed mixed bursts provides a natural explanation for the observed dramatic\nincrease of the burst parameter \u03b1 at high accretion luminosities (Fig. 18 and Cornelisse et\nal. 2003). In addition, there is some indication from the preliminary comparisons presented\nhere that burst systems have hot cores & 107.5 K, consistent with cooling in the neutron star\ninterior being dominated by the modified URCA process or a similar low-efficiency cooling\nmechanism. Cool cores with Tcore \u223c 107 K, as might be present if direct URCA cooling were\nto operate, are less likely. We also find a number of indications for small neutron star radii\n. 10 km. These results could be tightened with more careful modeling, e.g., by improving\nsome of the prescriptions we use for the input physics (\u00a76.5), and with more extensive and\nbetter quality data.\nWe thank Deepto Chakrabarty, Duncan Galloway, Erik Kuulkers, Feryal Ozel and Dimitrios Psaltis for useful discussions and comments. We are also grateful to the referee for a\nnumber of suggestions on the prescriptions used in \u00a72.3 and for comments that helped to\n\n\f\u2013 61 \u2013\nimprove the presentation of the paper.

The governing equations are given in equations (3)\u2013(7).\nWe use the notation defined in Table 1 and in equations (14), (15), where quantities like\n\u03c10 , T0 refer to the equilibrium, \u03c1, T refer to the corresponding quantities in the perturbed\nstate, and \u03c11 , T1 refer to the spatial component of the linear perturbations. The equilibrium\nquantities have no time dependence, while the perturbations have a time dependence of the\nform exp(\u03b3t). Since \u03b3 is in general complex, the quantities \u03c1, T , \u03c11 , T1 , etc. are complex,\nwhereas \u03c10 , T0 , etc. are real. Also, since X0 + Y0 + Z0 = 1 and X + Y + Z = 1, we have\nX1 + Y1 + Z1 = 0.\nLet us begin with the radiative transfer equation (4). For the equilibrium, this equation\ngives\n\u2202T0\n3\u03ba0 F0\n=\n,\n(A1)\n\u2202\u03a3\n16\u03c3T03\nwhere all quantities are real. For the perturbations, we linearize equation (4) and consider\nfirst-order deviations. This gives\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u2202T1\n3F0 \u2202 \u0010 \u03ba \u0011\n3\u03ba0\n\u2202 \u0010\u03ba\u0011\n\u2202 \u0010\u03ba\u0011\n\u2202 \u0010\u03ba\u0011\nF1 +\n=\n\u03c11 +\nT1 +\nX1 +\nY1 ,\n\u2202\u03a3\n16\u03c3T03\n16\u03c3 \u2202\u03c1 T 3 0\n\u2202T T 3 0\n\u2202X T 3 0\n\u2202Y T 3 0\n(A2)\n3\nwhere now the various quantities are in general complex. For instance, \u2202(\u03ba/T )/\u2202\u03c1 refers\nto the derivative of the complex quantity \u03ba/T 3 with respect to complex \u03c1 (the derivative is\nwell-defined since all the quantities are analytic). In practice, we calculate such derivatives\nnumerically. Since \u03ba in general depends on all three quantities X, Y , Z, it is necessary to\nreplace Z by 1 \u2212 X \u2212 Y or Z1 by \u2212X1 \u2212 Y1 before computing the partial derivatives \u2202/\u2202X,\n\u2202/\u2202Y .\nInstead of writing an equation for the linear perturbation T1 , we could equally well\nconsider the equation for the total (complex) perturbed temperature T = T0 + T1 exp(\u03b3t)T1 .\n\n\f\u2013 62 \u2013\nThis is nothing but the original equation\n\u2202T\n3\u03baF\n=\n,\n\u2202\u03a3\n16\u03c3T 3\n\n(A3)\n\nwhere F is now the total complex perturbed flux, and \u03ba is the opacity corresponding to\nthe perturbed \u03c1, T , X, Y . Within the linear approximation, this equation, coupled with\nequation (A1), has the same content as equation (A2) for the linear perturbations (equation\nA2 multiplied by exp(\u03b3t) is just the difference of equations A3 and A1). Equation (A3)\nhas the advantage of being more compact than equation (A2). It is also numerically more\nconvenient, since the compactness of the equation translates to relative simplicity of the\ncorresponding computer code.\nConsider next the H-evolution equation (6), which involves a time derivative. The\nequilibrium is described by\n\u2202X0\n\u01ebH,0\n\u03a3\u0307\n=\u2212 \u2217 ,\n(A4)\n\u2202\u03a3\nEH\nwhere all quantities are real. The linear first order perturbation X1 satisfies\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0015\n\u0014\u0012\n\u2202\u01ebH\n\u2202\u01ebH\n\u2202\u01ebH\n\u2202\u01ebH\n1\n\u2202X1\n\u03c11 +\nT1 +\nX1 +\nY1 ,\n=\u2212 \u2217\n\u03b3X1 + \u03a3\u0307\n\u2202\u03a3\nEH\n\u2202\u03c1 0\n\u2202T 0\n\u2202X 0\n\u2202Y 0\n\n(A5)\n\nwhere the term \u03b3X1 on the left comes from the time derivative \u2202/\u2202t operating on exp(\u03b3t)X1 .\nOnce again, instead of considering the equation for the perturbation X1 , we may write down\nthe equation for the total perturbed quantity X = X0 + exp(\u03b3t)X1 :\n\u03b3(X \u2212 X0 ) + \u03a3\u0307\n\n\u2202X\n\u01ebH\n=\u2212 \u2217,\n\u2202\u03a3\nEH\n\n(A6)\n\nwhich is nearly identical in form to equation (A4) for the equilibrium, except that (i) it has\nan extra term proportional to \u03b3 because of the time dependence of the perturbations, (i) \u01ebH\nis evaluated at the perturbed \u03c1, T , X, Y , and (iii) all quantities are complex.\nFollowing the above examples, the other three equations are straightforward.

We assume a value for the outgoing flux Fout,0 at the\nsurface of the layer, solve for \u03c1out,0 , Tout,0 , Xout,0 , Yout,0 from the outer boundary conditions,\nand then integrate the 5 differential equations down to the bottom of the layer and then into\nthe substrate to a depth equal to \u03a3diff defined in equation (18). At this depth, we require\nthe temperature T0 (\u03a3diff ) to be equal to the required core temperature Tcore . If it is not,\nwe change the value of Fout,0 and repeat until the inner boundary condition is satisfied. We\nthen have a valid equilibrium solution.\nFor the perturbations, we work with equations (A3), (A6), (A8, (A10), (A12), which are\nfive differential equations for the total perturbed quantities F , \u03c1, T , X, Y . At the surface,\nwe set the flux equal to Fout = Fout,0 + Fout,1 , where Fout,1 \u226a Fout,0 in order to satisfy the\nassumption of a linear perturbation of the equilibrium. We solve for the other variables at\nthe surface, assume a value for the eigenvalue \u03b3, and integrate the equations down to a depth\n\u03a3max in the substrate (see eq. 20). At this depth we require T (\u03a3max ) = T0 (\u03a3max ). We vary\n\u03b3 until this inner boundary condition is satisfied, at which point we have a solution for the\ncomplex eigenvalue \u03b3, and also the shape of the eigenfunction (F1 , \u03c11 , etc.). The search\nin \u03b3 space is tailored to find eigenvalues with positive real parts since only such modes are\nunstable.\nLet us define a turning point in the sequence of equilibria (S-curve) to be a point at\nwhich the locus of equilibrium solutions satisfies the condition d\u03a3layer /dFout,0 = 0. Since the\nderivative is zero, it means that two equilibria with escaping surface fluxes equal to Fout,0 and\n\n\f\u2013 64 \u2013\nFout = Fout,0 + Fout,1 , where Fout,1 \u226a Fout,0 , both satisfy the differential equations as well as\nthe boundary conditions for the same value of \u03a3layer . Now, the solution for Fout,0 satisfies the\nequilibrium equations (A1), (A4), (A7), (A9), (A11), while the solution for Fout satisfies the\nperturbed equations (A3), (A6), (A8), (A10), (A12). The only difference between the two\nsets of equations is the presence of various terms involving \u03b3. If the second solution is also\nan equilibrium solution, then it implies that it must satisfy the perturbation equations with\n\u03b3 precisely equal to 0, i.e., one of the modes of the system corresponds to 0 frequency. This\nresult is not surprising. Since the initial model is at a turning point, there are neighboring\nequilibria with the same value of \u03a3layer but different values of Fout,0 , i.e., the system has a\nlinear zero-frequency mode.\nThe above theorem, that a mode with \u03b3 = 0 exists at turning points of the S-curve,\nis well-known for one-zone models, e.g., see the discussion of Paczynski (1983a) for an application to bursts. Our discussion shows that the same result is valid even when one is\nconsidering the more complex model described here. The reason it works is that our equilibria are ultimately labeled by a single parameter, the value of Fout,0 at the surface. This\nis all that matters, and the fact that our solutions involve many variables and are described\nby continuous functions is not relevant.\n\nREFERENCES\nAllen, C.
