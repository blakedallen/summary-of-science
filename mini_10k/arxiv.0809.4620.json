While some studies suggest a defectchalcopyrite structure ( I4 ) others report a defect-stannite structure ( I42m ) for these\ncompounds. Both structures are tetragonal and structurally related to the cubic sphalerite\nstructure ( F43m ), commonly known as zinc-blende, with only differences arising due\nto slightly deviations on the atomic positions of the anions. This family of\nsemiconductors are of interest as possible infrared-transmitting windows materials.\nThey are also applied in various nonlinear optical devices and as gyrotropic media in\nnarrow-band optical filters. In addition, these compounds are promising optoelectronic\nmaterials due to their high values of nonlinear susceptibility, optical activity, intense\nluminescence, and high photosensitivity. Some compounds like CdGa2Se4 and CdAl2S4\nhave already found practical applications as tunable filters and ultraviolet\nVI\nphotodetectors [1, 2]. High-pressure studies on A II BIII\n2 X 4 compounds are receiving\n\nincreasing interest in the last years. In particular, these materials have been extensively\nstudied by Raman spectroscopy [3 \u2013 6] because of pressure-induced phase transitions.\nHowever, the structure of the high-pressure phases has been so far characterized only\nfor two compounds, CdGa2Se4 [7] and MnGa2Se4 [8]. In both materials the highpressure phase has been determined as a cubic NaCl-type structure.\nIn the present work, we report angle dispersive x-ray diffraction (ADXRD)\nmeasurements performed on ZnGa2Se4 and CdGa2S4 as a function of pressure in a\ndiamond-anvil cell (DAC) at room temperature up to 23 GPa. From these experiments,\nwe have determined the effect of pressure on the lattice parameters and atomic\npositions, as well as observed pressure-driven structural phase transitions. In both\n\n3\n\n\fcompounds, the high-pressure phase has been characterized and assigned to a defect\nNaCl-type structure. We also determined the equation of state (EOS) of CdGa2S4 and\nZnGa2Se4 and further discuss the systematics of pressure-induced phase transitions on\nsphalerite derivatives.\nII. Experiment\nSingle crystals of CdGa2S4 and ZnGa2Se4 were grown by chemical vapor\nmethod using iodine as a transport agent. The as grown crystals represent triangular\nprisms with mirror surfaces. Chemical and structural analyses have shown the\nstoichiometric composition of the crystals and no spurious phases were observed.\nADXRD experiments were carried out at room temperature under compression up to 23\nGPa using a DAC at Sector 16-IDB of the HPCAT, at the Advanced Photon Source\n(APS). CdGa2S4 was studied with an incident monochromatic wavelength of 0.36806 \u00c5\nand ZnGa2Se4 with a wavelength of 0.41521 \u00c5. The samples used in the experiments\nwere pre-pressed pellets prepared using a finely ground powder obtained from the as\ngrown single crystals. These pellets were loaded in a 130 \u03bcm hole of a rhenium gasket\nin a Mao-Bell-type DAC with diamond-culet sizes of 350 \u03bcm. A few ruby grains were\nalso loaded with the sample for pressure determination [9] and silicone oil was used as\npressure-transmitting medium [10, 11]. The monochromatic x-ray beam was focused\ndown to 10 \u00d7 10 \u03bcm2 using Kickpatrick-Baez mirrors. The images were collected using\na MAR345 image plate located 380 mm away from the sample in the CdGa2S4\nexperiment and 300 mm away from the sample in the ZnGa2Se4 experiment. The\ncollected images were integrated and corrected for distortions using FIT2D [12]. The\nstructure refinements were performed using the POWDERCELL [13] program package.\n\n4\n\n\fIII. Results and discussion\nIII.A. The structure of CdGa2S4 and ZnGa2Se4\nZnGa2Se4 has been reported to have either a tetragonal defect-chalcopyrite ( I4 ,\nZ = 2) or a tetragonal defect-stannite ( I42m , Z = 2) structure [14]. Both structures are\nshown in Fig. 1. Recent Raman measurements supported the space group I4 for\nZnGa2Se4 [15], but accurate neutron diffraction studies unambiguously established that\nit belongs to the space group I42m [16]. Our experiments agree with the conclusions\ndrawn from the neutron experiments. After a Rietveld refinement of an x-ray diffraction\npattern collected at ambient pressure (0.1 MPa) outside the DAC the following\nstructural parameters for defect-stannite ZnGa2Se4 were obtained: a = 5.512(3) \u00c5 and c\n= 10.963(6) \u00c5. The residuals of the refinement are RF2 = 2.52 %, RWP= 3.97 %, RP =\n2.07 %. The atomic positions obtained for the defect-stannite structure are summarized\nin Table I. According to the site occupation fraction obtained in the structural\nrefinement, a partial cation order is present in ZnGa2Se4 [16]. However, since Ga and\nZn have nearly equal x-ray scattering factors, it is hard to distinguish between this\nmodel with others considering a complete cation order (Zn at 2a and Ga at 4d) or a\ncomplete cation disorder (Zn:Ga =1/3:2/3 at 2a and 4d). Indeed these models resulted in\nslightly larger R-factors if considered for the structural refinement than the partial\nordering model (see atomic positions in Table I). Nevertheless, based upon this fact and\nthe conclusions drawn by Hanada [16], we think it can be concluded that the structure of\nZnGa2Se4 is defect-stannite as summarized in Table I. This type of structure is observed\nin the minerals famatinite (Cu3SbS4) and stannite (Cu2FeSnS4) [17]. According to the\npartial cation ordering model, in ZnGa2Se4, half of the Ga atoms occupy the position of\nFe in stannite, the other half and the Zn atoms occupy the position of Cu and the Se\natoms are located at the position of S. The structure of ZnGa2Se4 is called defect-\n\n5\n\n\fstannite (some authors call it defect-famatinite) because the Sn atoms (located at 2b in\nstannite) are replaced by vacancies in this compound. Further, in ZnGa2Se4 the Zn and\nGa cations and the vacancies are in tetrahedral coordination, but these tetrahedra differ\nin dimension and bond angles. For the Ga atoms located at 2a, the Ga-Se bond distance\nis 2.42 \u00c5 and for the Ga and Zn atoms located at 4d, the Ga(Zn)-Se bond distance is\n2.44 \u00c5. The vacancy-Se distance is 2.24 \u00c5. It is important to note that the cation-anion\nbonds are close to those found in ZnSe (2.45 \u00c5) [18] and in the high-temperature phase\nof Ga2Se3 (2.42 \u00c5) [19]. However, the vacancy-anion distance is much shorter, due to\nthe fact that the Se atoms are displaced from the ideal (1/4, 1/4, 1/8) towards the\nvacancy.\nRegarding CdGa2S4, it is accepted that it has a defect-chalcopyrite structure ( I4 )\nin which one cation site is also vacant (at 2d) [20]. In a similar way to ZnGa2Se4, we\nalso analyzed CdGa2S4 at ambient conditions outside the DAC. Rietveld refinement of\nthe x-ray diffraction pattern collected at ambient conditions provided the following\nstructural parameters for the defect-chalcopyrite structure of CdGa2S4: a = 5.536(3) \u00c5\nand c = 10.160(6) \u00c5 with refinement residuals RF2 = 2.02 %, RWP= 2.87 %, RP = 1.67\n%. The lattice parameters obtained agree with the values available in the literature. The\natomic positions determined in the structural refinement are summarized in Table II.\nThe structure observed for CdGa2S4 is typical to the mineral kesterite (Cu2ZnSnS4) [17].\nIn the case of CdGa2S4, half of the Ga atoms occupy the position of Sn as in kesterite,\nthe other half and the Cd atoms occupy the position of Cu, while the S atoms stay at the\nsame position. In this case, the vacancies occupy the position of Zn. The structure of\nCdGa2S4 is called defect-chalcopyrite because it can be constructed from the\nchalcopyrite structure of CuGaS2 ( I42d ) [21] by doubling the formula unit and\nreplacing Cu by Cd and a vacancy to maintain the valence. In CdGa2S4 the Cd and Ga\n\n6\n\n\fcations and the vacancies are in tetrahedral coordination, but these tetrahedra differ in\ndimension and bond angles. We found the Cd-S bond distance to be 2.52 \u00c5, the Ga-S\ndistance to be 2.33 \u00c5 (for the Ga atoms at 2b) and 2.29 \u00c5 (for Ga atoms at 2c). The\nvacancy-S distance was found to be 2.22 \u00c5. The Cd-S distance is exactly the same as in\nCdS [22] and the Ga-S distances are close to the ones reported for Ga2S3 (2.22 \u00c5) [23].\nIII.B. Pressure-induced phase transitions\nA summary of the results obtained in the high-pressure x-ray diffraction\nexperiments for ZnGa2Se4 and CdGa2S4 is shown in Figs. 2 and 3, respectively. In\nZnGa2Se4, we did not observe any substantial change in the x-ray diffraction patterns up\nto 10.37 GPa. At this pressure we found that most of the diffraction peaks become\nbroader. The peak broadening increases with pressure beyond 10.37 GPa. This\nbroadening can be clearly seen in Fig. 2 looking at the peak located near 2\u03b8 = 7.6o - the\n(112) reflection \u2013 whose full width at half maximum is smaller than 0.2o below 10.37\nGPa, but it becomes 0.3o at 10.37 GPa and 0.4o at 17.5 GPa. \u0391 similar phenomenon has\nbeen observed around 10 GPa in Raman measurements [3, 5]. Peak broadening in both\ncases could be related with an increase of the crystalline disorder induced by pressure. It\ncould be also related to non-hydrostatic effects due to the use of silicone oil as pressuretransmitting medium [11]. These effects cannot be neglected beyond 10 GPa. However,\nas we will show latter, the observed reduction of the anion distortion parameter \u03c30 under\ncompression supports the first hypothesis. At 15.5 GPa we observe the appearance of\nnew diffraction peaks. The intensity of these peaks is found to increase with pressure.\nThey are indicated by asterisks in the pattern collected at 17.5 GPa. At 18.5, the\nintensity of the peaks assigned to the low-pressure phase decreased considerably and the\nnew peaks became dominant in the diffraction pattern. The peaks corresponding to the\nlow-pressure phase disappeared at 19.2 GPa. All these changes indicated the occurrence\n\n7\n\n\fof a pressure-driven phase transition. We have located the onset of the transition at 15.5\nGPa and a coexistence of the low- and high-pressure phases was noticed up to 18.5\nGPa. The transition is complete at 19.2 GPa. Upon further compression the highpressure phase appears to remain stable up to 23 GPa, the highest pressure reached in\nour experiments. On pressure release, we reduced the pressure in three steps; from 23\nGPa to 14.7 GPa, 2 GPa, and ambient pressure, respectively. Apparently the phase\ntransition is irreversible since the diffraction pattern, collected on the sample recovered\nat ambient pressure, resembled very much the diffraction patterns of the high-pressure\nphase. In Raman experiments, decrease in the intensity of Raman signal has been\ndetected beyond 14.7 GPa and a total disappearance at 18.9 GPa [3, 5]. On\ndecompression the Raman signal was not completely recovered, as this fact is attributed\nto a partial amorphization of ZnGa2Se4. The pressure-induced changes in the Raman\nspectra are consistent with the changes that we observed in the x-ray diffraction pattern.\nIn both cases the onset of a phase transition is detected around 15 GPa with a\ncoexistence of the low- and high-pressure phases up to around 19 GPa. In CdGa2S4, we\ndid not observe any substantial change in the diffraction patterns up to 17 GPa. Beyond\nthis pressure, changes in the patterns occur suggesting also the appearance of a highpressure phase. At 21 GPa, only the high-pressure phase is present suggesting that the\nphase transition has been completed. We have identified the phase transition pressure as\n19(2) GPa. Raman measurements reported for CdGa2S4 show that the Raman signal\nirreversibly disappears at 15 GPa [3]. This fact was attributed to a phase transition to a\nNaCl-type structure and we believe that the transition we observed at slightly higher\npressures is also to a cubic phase. In contrast with ZnGa2Se4, we did not collect\ndiffraction patterns upon pressure release for CdGa2S4, so we cannot give any\ninformation on the reversibility of the reported phase transition.\n\n8\n\n\fWe performed full profile Rietveld refinement of the diffraction patterns\ncollected for the high-pressure phase. Similar to the defect-chalcopyrite selenides\nMnGa2Se4 and CdGa2Se4 [7, 8], the high-pressure phases of ZnGa2Se4 and CdGa2S4\nhave a higher-symmetry cubic NaCl-type structure ( Fm3m , Z = 1), where the Se atoms\nare located at the 4b site, while the Zn, Ga, and the vacancies are located at the 4a sites.\nThe phase transition implies an increase in the symmetry of the crystals and is\naccompanied by a change in the coordination of the cations from tetrahedral to\noctahedral. The similitude between the high-pressure behavior of defect-chalcopyrite\nand defect-stannite digallium tetraselenides and tetrasulphides is not surprising since\nboth kinds of structures are closely related. As a matter of fact, the ideal chalcopyrite\nand stannite structures are themselves ordered (tetragonal) versions of sphalerite (zincblende ZnSe) with the unit cell nearly doubled along [001] [24]. Both structures can be\nthought as superstructures of ZnSe (or ZnS) with the Zn atoms being replaced\nalternatively by Ga and Cd (Mn or Zn) atoms and vacancies. The only difference\nbetween them is the movement of the Se (S) atom away from (x,x,z) in I42m to (x,y,z)\nin I4 , reducing the site symmetry around the vacancy and one cation site from 42m to\n4 . ZnSe, ZnS, and isostructural tetrahedrally-coordinated semiconductors undergo zincblende to rock-salt pressure-induced phase transitions [25]. Therefore, based upon\ncrystallochemical arguments a transition to a NaCl-type structure is also expected in\nboth tetragonal tetraselenides and tetrasulphides [26]. It is worth mentioning that, x-ray\ndiffraction experiments performed on MnGa2Se4 also reported an irreversible NaCl-type\ntransition very similar to our observation on ZnGa2Se4 [8]. On the other hand, x-ray\ndiffraction experiments for CdGa2Se4 show that the NaCl-type phase transforms into a\nzinc-blende-type structure below 5 GPa upon decompression and this structure is\ndifferent to the defect-chalcopyrite structure [7]. Our results are in good agreement with\n\n9\n\n\fthe studies of Marquina et al. [8], and also they agree well with the conclusions drawn\nfrom Raman measurements on CdGa2Se4, CdGa2S4, ZnGa2Se4, and ZnGa2S4 [3, 6]. In\nthese studies the samples recovered at ambient pressure were found to be Raman\ninactive, while the zinc-blende structure is expected to have two Raman active phonons.\nIn contrast with these results, Raman studies performed by Mitani et al. [6] showed that\nRaman bands were recovered for CdGa2Se4 upon decompression, but they do not\ncorrespond to the defect-chalcopyrite structure. On top of that, unpublished opticalabsorption measurements on single-crystalline CdGa2Se4 and ZnGa2Se4 show a new\nphase on pressure release from the high-pressure phase [27]. In order to solve this\npuzzle, clearly more research is needed to clarify whether a metastable phase is obtained\nupon pressure release in digallium tetraselenides and tetrasulphides or not.\nIII.C. Pressure dependence of the lattice parameters and equations of state\nFrom the refinement of x-ray diffraction patterns we have obtained the pressure\ndependence of the lattice parameters for the low- and high-pressure phases. The\npressure evolution of the structural parameters and the atomic volume (V) of ZnGa2Se4\nand CdGa2S4 are shown in Figs. 4 and 5, respectively. To make it easier for comparison\nbetween the low- and high-pressure phases, we plotted 2V instead of V for the NaCltype phase. In ZnGa2Se4, the compression of the low-pressure phase is slightly\nanisotropic up to 10.4 GPa. The axial ratio c/a increases from 1.988 at ambient pressure\nto 2 at 10.4 GPa and beyond this pressure the c/a remains constant within the\nuncertainty of the experiments. In CdGa2S4, the compression of the low-pressure phase\nis highly anisotropic. In particular, c/a increases from 1.835 to 1.913 from ambient\npressure to 17 GPa following a nearly linear pressure dependence. The larger increase\nof the axial ratio in CdGa2S4 is related to the smaller compressibility of the c-axis in this\ncompound. A similar behavior has been observed in MnGa2Se4 and CdGa2Se4; i.e.\n\n10\n\n\fapparently the four sphalerite-derivative compounds become more symmetric prior to\nthe occurrence of the phase transition. In ZnGa2Se4, the lattice parameters at 18.5 GPa\nare a = 5.064 \u00c5 and c = 10.156 \u00c5 for the low-pressure phase and a = 5.064 \u00c5 for the\nhigh-pressure phase. Therefore, a volume collapse of about 4.6 % is observed at the\nphase transition. In CdGa2S4, the lattice parameters at 17 GPa are a = 5.064 \u00c5 and c =\n10.156 \u00c5 for the low-pressure phase, while for the high-pressure phase we obtained a =\n4.911 \u00c5 at 22 GPa, which implies a volume collapse of about 5 %. The presence of the\nvolume collapses is in agreement with the results reported for MnGa2Se4 and CdGa2Se4\n[7, 8]. It also indicates that the reported transition is a first-order transition.\nThe pressure-volume curves shown in Figs. 4 and 5 were analyzed using a\nBirch-Murnaghan EOS: P =\n\n(\n\n3\nB0 x 7 / 3 \u2212 x 5 / 3\n2\n\n) \uf8ee\uf8ef\uf8f01 + 34 ( B\n\n'\n0\n\n)(\n\n)\n\n\uf8f9\n\u2212 4 x 2 / 3 \u2212 1 \uf8fa , with x =V0/V,\n\uf8fb\n\nwhere the parameters V0 , B0, and B0' are the zero-pressure volume, bulk modulus, and\npressure derivative of the bulk modulus, respectively. For the defect-stannite phase of\nZnGa2Se4, by fixing V0 = 333.08 \u00c53 (the measured value at ambient pressure outside\nthe DAC), we obtained B0 = 47(2) GPa and B0' = 3.9(3). For the NaCl-type structure of\nZnGa2Se4, by fixing V0 = 156.5 \u00c53 (the measured value at ambient pressure in the\nrecovered sample) and B0' = 4, we obtained B0 = 50(2) GPa. For the defect-chalcopyrite\nphase of CdGa2S4, by fixing V0 = 311.38 \u00c53 (the measured value at ambient pressure\noutside the DAC), we obtained B0 = 64(2) GPa and B0' = 4.1(3). From these results we\nconclude that the low-pressure phase of ZnGa2Se4 has a similar compressibility to the\nlow-pressure phases of MnGa2Se4, B0 = 44(2) GPa [8] and CdGa2Se4, B0 = 42(2) GPa\n[7] for the low-pressure phase. For the high-pressure phase of CdGa2S4 we do not have\nenough data points to determine its EOS parameters. However, apparently the cubic\nhigh-pressure phase is less compressible than the tetragonal phases, as observed by us in\nZnGa2Se4 and by Marquina et al. in MnGa2Se4 [8]. We also conclude that the\n\n11\n\n\ftetraselenides are more compressible than the tetrasulphides, which is consistent with\nthe fact that for binary compounds like ZnSe, ZnS, CdSe, and CdS, the sulphides are\nharder than the selenides [25]. Previously a bulk modulus of 66 GPa (88 GPa) was\ncalculated for ZnGa2Se4 (CdGa2S4) using the equation deduced by Baranovsky within a\ntight-binding approach [28]. The same approach predicts a bulk modulus of 64 GPa for\nCdGa2Se4. Our and previous measurements show that the tight-binding model\noverestimates B0 by more than 40%.\nWe also analyzed the pressure evolution of bond distances. From our Rietveld\nrefinements we found that not only the structure of ZnGa2Se4 becomes more symmetric\nunder compression, but also the position of the Se atoms gradually approach the ideal\nposition (1/4,1/4,1/8). In particular, the coordinate x of Se change from 0.264 at ambient\npressure to 0.257 at 13.3 GPa (the highest pressure were we observed a pure defectstannite structure), while the z coordinate of Se changes from 0.117 to 0.121. As a\nconsequence of all these changes on the anion coordinates, the Ga-Se bond\ncorresponding to the Ga atom located at the position 2a is reduced a 20% more than the\nother cation-Se bonds. Additionally, all the cation-Se bonds increase approximately a\n3%; and the Se-Se distances decrease a 3% at the phase transition. The second change is\ncaused by the volume collapse of the structure of ZnGa2Se4, while the first one is\ncaused by the reordering of the cation positions. We also found that upon compression\nCdGa2S4 becomes more symmetric and that the position of the S atoms gradually\napproach the ideal position (1/4,1/4,1/8). In particular the x coordinate of S changes\nfrom 0.270 at ambient pressure to 0.265 at 17 GPa and the y coordinate of S changes\nfrom 0.260 to 0.250. On the other hand, the z coordinate of S changes from 0.140 to\n0.130. As a consequence of all these changes on the anion coordinates, the Cd-S bond is\nreduced around 50% more than the other cation-Se bonds. A similar preferred\n\n12\n\n\fcompressibility of the Cd-Se bonds has been reported in CdGa2Se4 [7]. Additionally, all\nthe cation-S bonds increase approximately 8% and the S-S distances decrease 8% at the\ntransition. As in ZnGa2Se4, the second change in CdGa2S4 is caused by a volume\ncollapse and the first one by reordering of the cation positions.\nIt is interesting to see that in ZnGa2Se4 and CdGa2Se4 the Ga-Se bonds have a\nsimilar average compressibility. The same behavior can be deduced for MnGa2Se4 from\nthe data reported in Ref. [8]. Since in ternary compounds the bulk compressibility is\nrelated to the polyhedral compressibility [29, 30] it is not strange that the three studied\ndigallium tetraselenides have a similar compressibility. Therefore a bulk modulus close\nto 45 GPa should be expected also for HgGa2Se4 [31].\nWe mentioned above that an increase of the cationic disorder apparently takes\nplace in ZnGa2Se4. This disorder may be the origin of the precursor effects of the\ntransition observed in x-ray experiments in CdGa2Se4 [7] and in Raman experiments in\nfour different digallium tetraselenides and tetrasulphides [3]. Optical-absorption\nmeasurements also detect the precursor effects on ZnGa2Se4 and CdGa2Se4 around 13\nGPa, which are responsible of non-reversible changes on the optical-absorption edge\n[27]. Earlier it was shown that order-disorder phase transition takes place in defectchalcopyrite tetraselenides at high temperatures and ambient pressure only when the\ntetragonal distortion parameter \u03b4 = 2 \u2212 c / a , is smaller than 0.05 [32]. A considerable\nreduction of this parameter was observed both in MnGa2Se4 and CdGa2Se4 before the\ntransition to the rock-salt structure [7, 8]. In our case, we observed that this parameter\ndecreases from 0.165 at ambient pressure to 0.087 at 17 GPa for CdGa2Se4. In\nZnGa2Se4 \u03b4 is equal to 0.022 at ambient pressure and approaches zero before the phase\ntransition. On top of that, we also found in both compounds a decrease of the anion\ndistortion parameter \u03c3 0 =\n\n( x \u2212 0.25)2 + ( y \u2212 0.25)2 + ( z \u2212 0.125)2\n13\n\nupon compression.\n\n\fThis parameter decreases for ZnGa2Se4 from 0.0214 at ambient pressure to 0.0107 at\n13.3 GPa and from 0.117 at ambient pressure to 0.052 at 17 GPa for CdGa2S4. A similar\ndecrease was also found upon compression for MnGa2Se4 [8]. According with Garbato\n\net al. [19], both the reduction of \u03b4 and \u03c30 causes an increase of the cation disorder.\nThus, the relation suggested above is fully consistent with the Raman and diffraction\npeak broadening and the increase of the crystalline disorder observed during\ncompression.\n\nIII.D. Size criterion\nAccording to an empirical rule (size criterion) proposed by Jayaraman et al. [33]\nthe transition pressure from tetrahedral to octahedral coordination in ABX2 compounds\n(e.g. chalcopyrite CuGaSe2) increases with decreasing the ratio between the averaged\ncation radius, (rA + rB)/2, and the anion radius, rX. Other size criteria, similar to\nJayaraman's rule, have been proven to work satisfactory to predict the transition\npressure in ternary compounds [34, 35]. However, Beister et al. [36] have challenged\nJayaraman \u0301s rule based upon data on LiInSe2, CuInSe2 and AgInSe2. These authors\nproposed the transition pressure should increase with the decreasing cation radius\ndifference rA \u2212 rB . Other authors tried to rationalize the transition pressure from a\nfourfold-coordinated structure to a sixfold-coordinated structure using the crystal\nionicity [3], but this approach did not give a clear systematic for the transition pressures\nof ABX2 and AB2X4 compounds. By comparing all the data available on the literature\non twenty-three different tetragonal-coordinated ABX2 and AB2X4 compounds, we will\nshow that the transition pressure on these compounds can be rationalized using the ionic\nradius on cations and anions in a similar way than proposed by Jayaraman. Table III\ndisplays the transition pressures for twenty-three different ABX2 and AB2X4\ncompounds with structures related to sphalerite and the ionic radii of the elements A, B,\n\n14\n\n\fand X [37]. Fig. 6 shows the transition pressure as a function of \u03be = (rA + rB ) / 2rX . In\nthe figure, it can be seen that most of the compounds of interest follows two clear\nsystematics. One for those compounds with large cations (1.35 > rA + rB > 1.15) and\nanother for the compounds with small cations (rA + rB < 1.15). It is interesting to see that\nalso spinel-structured AB2X4 compounds seem to follow the same systematic. In\nparticular, compounds like ZnAl2S4, CuIr2S4, MgAl2O4, CuCrZrS4, and Zn2TiO4 match\nvery well with the systematic reported in Fig. 6 (see Table III). As shown in Fig. 6,\napparently also the compounds with 1.45 > rA + rB > 1.35 and 1.45 > rA + rB have a\nsimilar tendency to the increase of the transition pressure with the increase of \u03be. It is\nimportant to note here that the fitting lines shown in Fig. 6 for each cation-size regime\nare dependent on the high-pressure points. Unfortunately, in the literature there are few\ndata available for \u03be values from 0.35 to 0.4, which make the systematic here proposed\nonly valid to make back-of-the-envelope estimations for transition pressures in\ncompounds not studied upon compression yet. Regarding the criterion proposed by\nBeister et al., it is clear from Table III that no possible correlation could be established\nbetween the transition pressures and cation radius difference rA \u2212 rB . We strongly\nbelieve that the comparison made by Beister et al. between LiInSe2, CuInSe2 and\nAgInSe2 was inadequate and it also mislead these authors to challenge Jayaraman's rule.\nLiInSe2 has an orthorhombic structure (Pna21) which is not related to sphalerite and\nfurthermore its cations do not have a tetrahedral coordination. Therefore,\nphenomenological comparisons are not possible between LiInSe2 and the other two\ncompounds. Further, the transition pressure for AgInSe2 (2.5 GPa) was taken by Beister\net al. from resistivity and x-ray diffraction measurements performed under highly nonhydrostatic conditions [38]. Uniaxial stresses are known to strongly affect pressureinduced phase transitions reducing the transition pressure by 10 GPa [11]. On the other\n\n15\n\n\fhand, selenides usually have higher transition pressures than isomorphous tellurides,\nand AgInTe2 is known to remain stable at least up to 2.7 GPa according to x-ray\ndiffraction experiments [39]. So the early studies on AgInSe2 are not good candidates to\nestablish a systematic for ABX2 compounds. From the systematic behavior of Fig. 6, a\ntransition pressure of 8(2) GPa is predicted for AgInSe2 (rA + rB = 1.60 and \u03be = 0.40).\nThis suggests that studies taking advantage of the state-of-the-art synchrotron facilities\nare needed to clarify the high-pressure structural behavior of AgInSe2. It would be also\ninteresting to perform such studies on AgInS2 and AgInTe2. For these compounds we\npredict transition pressures of 12(2) GPa and 4(2) GPa, respectively. In AgInS2 and\nAgInTe2 x-ray diffraction experiments have been performed only up to 5 GPa [40] and\n2.7 GPa [39], respectively, and the chalcopyrite structure found to be stable up to these\npressures. An extension of these studies is required to test our predictions. The\nsystematic proposed in this work could be also applied to other sphalerite-related\ncompounds like defect-chalcopyrite HgGa2Se4 [31] and double-defective chalcopyrite\nInPS4 [41], for which transition pressures of 9(2) and 7(2) GPa are predicted. It is\nimportant to note here, that the systematic established in this work cannot be applied to\nABX2 and AB2X4 compounds with structures not related to sphalerite similar to\nLiInSe2, and like most of the alkaline-earth digallium tetraselenides, which usually\ncrystallize in an orthorhombic structure [42]. However, the same systematic apparently\nworks well in spinel-structured AB2X4 compounds. At least in those where the\nstructural stability of the compound is not affected by Jahn-Teller effects caused by the\npresence of magnetic ions. One example of these compounds is MgAl2O4 (see Table III\nand Fig. 6). Based upon these facts, predictions can be made for the transition pressures\nof MgGa2O4 and MgIn2O4, for which transition pressures of 28(3) GPa and 26(3) GPa\n\n16\n\n\fare predicted. For the cases of ZnAl2O4 and CdAl2O4 we have predicted transition\npressures as 37(4) GPa and 33(4) GPa respectively.\nTo conclude the discussion, we would like to comment that in CuGaTe2 and\nCuInTe2 the following pressure-induced structural sequence is observed: chalcopyrite\n\u2192 rock-salt \u2192 Cmcm [43]. The same structural sequence has been observed in\nsphalerite-structured binary semiconductors like CdTe [25]. Therefore, upon\ncystallochemical arguments [26] it is quite reasonable to speculate the sphalerite-related\nto NaCl-type transition for all the compounds reviewed here. Our results further suggest\nthat at higher pressures a second transition to a Cmcm structure could take place in most\nof them.\nIV. Conclusions\nHigh-pressure ADXRD experiments on two sphalerite-related defective\nsemiconductors have been reported. The results obtained show that ZnGa2Se4 has a\ntetragonal defect-stannite structure from atmospheric pressure to 15.2 GPa.\nFurthermore, the tetragonal structure co-exists with a higher-symmetry cubic structure\nfrom 15.2 to 18.5 GPa, and beyond this pressure, only the cubic structure is stable up to\n23 GPa. In CdGa2S4 it has been found that the structure is a tetragonal defect\nchalcopyrite up to 17 GPa and beyond a pressure-induced phase transition takes place to\na cubic structure similar to ZnGa2Se4. The results obtained were compared with those\npreviously reported in isostructural compounds. The role played by cation disorder in\nthe observed transition is discussed. Finally, a room temperature equation EOS for the\ntitle compounds is reported and a systematic for pressure-driven phase transitions in\nsphalerite-related compounds is discussed.\n\n17\n\n\fAcknowledgments\nThis study was supported by the Spanish government MEC under Grants No:\nMAT2007-65990-C03-01, MAT2006-02279, and CSD-2007-00045 and the Generalitat\nValenciana (Project GV06/151).
