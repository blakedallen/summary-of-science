For ensembles consisting of pairs of N \u00d7 N hermitian\n\nmatrices M1 and M2 , the U (N ) invariant probability measure is taken to be of the form:\n1\n1\n1\nd\u03bc(M1 , M2 ) :=\nexp tr (\u2212V1 (M1 ) \u2212 V2 (M2 ) + M1 M2 )dM1 dM2 .\n\u03c4N\n\u03c4N\n~\n\n(1.0.1)\n\nwhere dM1 dM2 is the standard Lebesgue measure for pairs of Hermitian matrices and the potentials V1\nand V2 are chosen to be polynomials of degrees d1 + 1, d2 + 1 respectively, with real coefficients. The\noverall positive small parameter ~ in the exponential is taken of order N \u22121 when considering the large\nN limit, but in the present context it will just play the role of Planck's constant in the string equation.\nUsing the Harish-Chandra-Itzykson-Zuber formula, one can reduce the computation of the corresponding partition function to an integral over only the eigenvalues of the two matrices\n\u03c4N :=\n\nZ Z\n\nd\u03bc(M1 , M2 ) \u221d\n\nZ Y\nN\n\n1\n\ndxi dyi \u2206(x)\u2206(y)e\u2212 ~\n\ni=1\n\nPN\n\nj=1\n\nV1 (xj )+V2 (yj )\u2212xj yj\n\n,\n\n(1.0.2)\n\nand then express all spectral statistics in terms of the associated biorthogonal polynomials, in the same\nspirit as orthogonal polynomials are used in the spectral statistics of one-matrix models [24]. In this\ncontext, what is meant by biorthogonal polynomials is a pair of sequences of monic polynomials\n\u03c0n (x) = xn + * * * ,\n\n\u03c3n (y) = y n + * * * ,\n\nn\u2208N\n\nwhich are mutually dual with respect to the associated coupled measure on the product space\nZZ\n1\ndx dy \u03c0n (x)\u03c3m (y)e\u2212 ~ (V1 (x)+V2 (y)\u2212xy) = hn \u03b4mn .\n\n(1.0.3)\n\n(1.0.4)\n\nR R\n\nIn this work, we use essentially the same definition of orthogonality, but extend it to the case of\npolynomials V1 and V2 with arbitrary (possibly complex) coefficients, with the contours of integration\nno longer restricted to the real axis, but taken as curves in the complex plane starting and ending at\n\u221e, chosen so that the integrals are convergent. The orthogonality relations determine the two families\nuniquely, if they exist [13, 3].\n\nIt was shown in [2, 3] that the finite consecutive subsequences of lengths d2 + 1 and d1 + 1 respectively,\nwithin the sequences of dual quasi-polynomials:\n1\n1\n1\n1\n\u03c8n (x) = \u221a \u03c0n (x)e\u2212 ~ V1 (x) , \u03c6n (y) = \u221a \u03c3n (y)e\u2212 ~ V2 (y) ,\nhn\nhn\n\n(1.0.5)\n\nbeginning (or ending) at the points n = N , satisfy compatible overdetermined systems of first order\ndifferential equations with polynomial coefficients of degrees d1 and d2 , respectively, as well as recursion\n1\n\n\frelations for consecutive values of N . In fact, certain quadruples of Differential\u2013Deformation\u2013Difference\nequations (DDD for short) were derived for these \"windows\", as well as for their Fourier Laplace transforms, in which the deformation parameters were taken to be the coefficients of the potentials V1 and V2 .\nIt was shown in [2, 3] that these systems are Frobenius compatible and hence admit joint fundamental\nsystems of solutions.\nIn the present work we explicitly construct such fundamental systems in terms of certain integral\ntransforms applied to the biorthogonal polynomials. The main purpose is to derive the Riemann\u2013Hilbert\nproblem characterizing the sectorial asymptotic behavior at x = \u221e or y = \u221e.\n\nThe ultimate purpose of this analysis is to deduce in a rigorous way the double\u2013scaling limits N \u2192\n\n\u221e, ~N = O(1) of the partition function and spectral statistics, for which the corresponding large N\n\nasymptotics of the biorthogonal polynomials are required. (See [12, 22] and references therein for further\nbackground on 2-matrix models, and [9, 14, 15, 16, 13] for other more recent developments.) The study\nof the large N limit of matrix integrals is of considerable interest in physics, since many physical systems\n\nhaving a large number of strongly correlated degrees of freedom (quantum chaos, mesoscopic conductors,\n. . .) share the statistical properties of the spectra of random matrices. Also, the large N expansion of a\nrandom matrix integral (if it exists) is expected to be the generating functional of discretized surfaces, and\ntherefore random matrices provide a powerful tool for studying statistical physics on a random surface.\n(The 2-matrix model was first introduced in this context, as the Ising model on a random surface [22].)\nIt has been understood for some time that the 1-matrix model is not general enough, since it cannot\nrepresent all models of statistical physics (e.g., it contains only the (p, 2) conformal minimal models). In\norder to recover the missing conformal models ((p, q) with p and q integers), it is necessary to introduce at\nleast a two-matrix model [9]. The 1-matrix models are actually included in the 2-matrix models, since if\none takes d2 = 1, and integrates over the Gaussian matrix M2 , one sees that the 1-matrix model follows,\nand hence may be seen as a particular case.\nIt should also be mentioned that most of the results about the 2-matrix model (in particular those\nderived in the present work) can easily be extended to multi-matrix models without major modifications\n(see the appendix of [2]). Indeed, the multi-matrix model is not expected to be very different from the\n2-matrix case [9]. (In particular, it contains the same conformal models.)\nThe present paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, we present the required formalism for biorthogonal polynomials, beginning with the systems of differential and recursion relations they satisfy, and\nrecalling the main definitions and results of [2]. We then derive the fundamental systems of solutions\nto the overdetermined systems for the \"windows\" of biorthogonal polynomials in two ways: one, by exploiting the recursion matrices Q, P for the biorthogonal polynomials, which satisfy the string equation,\nand another by giving explicit integral formulas for solutions and showing their independence when taken\nover a suitably defined homology basis of inequivalent integration paths.\n\n2\n\n\fIn Section 3 we use saddle-point integration methods to deduce the asymptotic form of these fundamental systems of solutions within the various Stokes sectors, and from these, to deduce the Stokes\nmatrices and jump discontinuities at \u221e. The full formulation of the matrix Riemann-Hilbert problem\ncharacterizing these solutions is given in Theorem 3.1.\n\nAcknowledgements: The authors would like to thank A. Kapaev for helpful comments concerning nonsingular integral representations of the fundamental systems of solutions to eq.

Let us fix two polynomials which will be referred to as the \"potentials\",\nV1 (x) = u0 +\n\ndX\n1 +1\nK=1\n\nuK K\nx ,\nK\n\nV2 (y) = v0 +\n\ndX\n2 +1\nJ=1\n\nvJ J\ny .\nJ\n\n(2.1.1)\n\nIn terms of these potentials we define a bimoment functional, i.e., a bilinear pairing between polynomials\n\u03c0(x) and \u03c3(y) by means of the following formula\nZ\nZ\n\u0001\n1\n\u03c0, \u03c3 :=\ndxdy e\u2212 ~ (V1 (x)+V2 (y)\u2212xy) \u03c0(x)\u03c3(y) .\n\u0393(x)\n\n(2.1.2)\n\n\u0393(y)\n\nThe contours of integration \u0393(x) , \u0393(y) in the complex x and y planes remain to be specified. They will\ngenerally be chosen to begin and end at \u221e, approaching it asymptotically in any direction that assures\n\nconvergence. More generally, linear combinations of such integrals along various inequivalent contours\nmay also be chosen. In fact there are precisely d1 (homologically) independent choices for the individual\ncontours in the x plane and d2 in the y-plane, due to the choice of the integrands [5]. The necessary and\nsufficient condition for the convergence of these integrals is that the contours approach \u221e in such a way\nthat\n\nR(V1 (x)) \u2212\u2192 +\u221e,\n\nR(V2 (y)) \u2212\u2192 +\u221e.\n\nx\u2192\u221e\n\ny\u2192\u221e\n\n(2.1.3)\n\nFor k = 0, . . . 2d1 + 1 (mod 2d1 + 2) and l = 0, . . . 2d2 + 1 (mod 2d2 + 2), let us define the sectors\n\u0013\u001b\n\u001a\n\u0012\n(2k + 1)\u03c0\n(2k \u2212 1)\u03c0\n(x)\n,\n(2.1.4)\n, \u03b8y +\nSk := x \u2208 C , arg(x) \u2208 \u03b8x +\n2(d1 + 1)\n2(d1 + 1)\n)/(d1 + 1) ,\n\u0013\u001b\n\u001a\u03b8x := \u2212 arg(ud1 +1\u0012\n(2l + 1)\u03c0\n(2l \u2212 1)\u03c0\n(y)\n,\n(2.1.5)\n, \u03b8y +\nSl := y \u2208 C , arg(y) \u2208 \u03b8y +\n2(d2 + 1)\n2(d2 + 1)\n\u03b8y := \u2212 arg(vd2 +1 )/(d2 + 1) .\n3\n\n\f(x)\n\nDefinition 2.1 (See Fig. 1) The wedge contours in the x-plane (resp. y-plane) \u0393i\n\n(y)\n\n(resp. \u0393j ) for\n\n(y)\n\n(x)\n\n(resp. \u0393\u0303j ) for i = 0, . . . d1 (resp.\n\ni = 0, . . . d1 (resp. j = 0, . . . d2 ), and the anti-wedge contours \u0393\u0303i\nj = 0, . . . d2 ) are defined as follows:\n(x)\n\n\u2022 \u0393i\n\n(y)\n\n(x)\n\n(y)\n\n(x)\n\n(y)\n\n(y)\n\n(x)\n\nsector S2i (resp.

(2.1.19), (2.1.20)\nand eqs. (2.1.24), (2.1.25) will automatically satisfy the systems specified in Lemma 2.2 (differential and\ndifference equations).\nIn the following, we will only consider the fundamental systems of solutions to the sequence of equations (2.1.38), (2.1.39), (2.1.54), (2.1.55), since the corresponding dual sequence of equations for the\nN\n\nquantities \u03a6(y), \u03a8(y) may be treated analogously by just making the appropriate interchange of noN\ntations x \u2194 y, \u03a8 \u2194 \u03a6, d1 \u2194 d2 , etc., and the interchange of integration contours in the x and y\nplanes.\n\nIn [2] it was shown that there exists a natural nondegenerate Christoffel\u2013Darboux pairing between\nN\n\ne\ne (x) and \u03a6(x)\nany pair of solutions \u03a8\nto eqs.

The (d2 + 1) \u00d7 (d2 + 1) matrix A is the only nonzero block in the\nN \u22121\nN \u22121\ncommutator \u03a0 , Q , where \u03a0 denotes the projector onto the first N basis elements (a \"canonical\"\n0\n\n0\n\nN\n\nprojector). In the following it is convenient to use the same notation A both for the finite matrix and\nthe semi-infinite one.\nN\n\ne and \u03a6\ne as joint solutions\nIt was also proved in [2] (Proposition 3.3) that one can choose the windows \u03a8\nN\n\nof the PDE's following from the infinitesimal changes of the coefficients {uJ } and {vK } of the potentials\n\n(deformation equations). For this choice, the pairing also becomes independent of these deformation\nparameters.\n10\n\n\fFundamental solutions of the D1 and D 1 systems\n\n2.2\n\nN\n\nIn this section we explicitly construct solutions of the pairs of dual ODE's defined by the matrices D1 (x)\nN\n\nand D1 (x). In fact these solutions will simultaneously satisfy the deformation equations and the ladder\nrecursion relations in N . It will be left to the reader to formulate the corresponding statements for the\nN\n\nN\n\nother pairs (D2 (y), D2 (y)), which are essentially the same, mutatis mutandis.\nAs mentioned in Remark 2.1, taking windows within any wave-vector solution to eqs. (2.1.19), (2.1.24)\none obtains solutions to the difference-differential equations in Lemma 2.2. Therefore we could try to\nconstruct d2 + 1 such wave-vector solutions in order to obtain a fundamental system for eqs. (2.1.39).\nOn the other hand it will be shown in Proposition 2.1 below that the relations (2.1.24) have precisely d2\nlinearly independent wave-vector solutions (given by the d2 Fourier\u2013Laplace transforms (2.1.17)) while\nrelations (2.1.19) have only one solution (given by the quasipolynomials). Therefore we will look for\nsolutions to slightly modified recursion relations differing from (2.1.19), (2.1.25) by changing the initial\nterms5 . The solutions to these modified recursion relations {\u03c8\u0303n (x)}n\u22650 or {\u03c8 \u0303 (x)}n\u22650 will still satisfy\nn\n\nthe unmodified recursions relations, but only for n large enough. This will provide us with the required\nsolutions of the difference-differential equations of Lemma 2.2.\nWe start by proving that the Fourier\u2013Laplace transforms and the quasipolynomials are the only\nwave-vector solutions to eqs. (2.1.19), (2.1.24).\nNotational remark.

Using the x recursion relations for the \u03c8 sequence, we can build the rest of the sequence by\nstarting from the first term \u03c80 (x), since the matrix Q has only one nonzero diagonal above the principal\none. On the other hand, using the \u2202x recursion relations we can build the rest of the \u03c6n sequence starting\nfrom any given solutions \u03c60 of (2.2.5) because the matrix P has only one diagonal below the main one.\nQ.

Indeed the matrices\nW1 and W2 (which are polynomials in Q and P of degrees d1 \u2212 1 and d2 \u2212 1 respectively) have finite band\nsizes, and hence when acting on the vectors U (x) and F (x), which have only a first nonzero entry, produce\n\na finite number of nonzero entries. As a result, windows taken from any solution of the modified wavevector systems (2.2.7), (2.2.8) will provide solutions of the Difference-Differential systems of Lemma 2.2,\nbut only beyond a minimal N value (d1 or d2 respectively).\nProof.

For the unmodified system (2.2.1) the solution is explicitly given by the quasipolynomials\n\u221e\n\n(0)\n\n(x). The other solutions of the wave-equations (2.2.7) are in 1 \u2212 1 correspondence with the d2\n\n\u03a8\n\u221e\nsolutions of eq. (2.2.15) via eq. (2.2.18). We could try to define an integral representation of the form\nZ\nZ\n1\ndy 1 (V2 (y)\u2212yx)\ne\u2212 ~ (V2 (t)\u2212zt)\n(k)\n~\n(x)\n=\ndz\ndt\n(2.3.15)\ne\n\u03a8\n\u03a8(z) ,\n\u221e\nt\u2212y\ne (y) 2i\u03c0~\n\u03ba\u0393\n\u0393\nk\ncorresponding to the following solution of eq. (2.2.15)\n\u221a Z\n1\nh0\ndy e ~ (V2 (y)\u2212xy)\nf (k) (x) :=\n2i\u03c0~ \u0393e k(y)\n\nk = 1, . . . , d2 .\n\n(2.3.16)\n\nHowever formula (2.3.15) is not well-defined, since the inner integral defines only a piecewise analytic\n(y)\ne (y) crosses\nfunction with jump discontinuities along the \u0393 's, and each of the anti-wedge contours \u0393\nk\n\nk\n\n20\n\n\f(y)\n\nat least one of the contours \u0393j . One could alternatively take the analytic continuation of the inner\nSd2\n(y)\n\u0393k to an entire function, which amounts to\ndouble integral from one connected component of Cy \\ k=1\n\ndeforming the contours in \u03ba\u0393 to avoid any jump discontinuities. But then the outer integral is in general\ndivergent, due to the behaviour of the integrand as y \u2192 \u221e.\n\nThus, as it stands, eq. (2.3.15) may only be viewed as a formal expression which at best defines a\n\ndivergent integral. However, treating it naively (as though it were uniformly convergent with respect to\nthe parameters {uJ , vK }, as well as x) we would find that it indeed satisfies eqs. (2.2.7) (2.2.40) and\n(2.2.41). Nonetheless we know that there are solutions \u03a8(k) of eq. (2.2.7) (2.2.40) corresponding to the\n\u221e\n\nf (k) (x) defined in (2.3.16), determined recursively from the solutions of eq. (2.2.18). Such solutions are\nuniquely defined by the choice of a particular solution to eq. (2.2.15), up to the addition of a solution of\nthe homogeneous equation (that is, the quasipolynomials) forming \u03a8(0) .\n\u221e\n\nThere does exist a way to arrive at convergent integral representations, however, by forming suitable\nlinear combinations of Fourier-Laplace transforms of a piecewise analytic function defined along appropriate contours. This was done for the case of cubic potentials by Kapaev in [21]. In Appendix A, it will be\nindicated how the procedure used there may be extended to polynomial potentials of higher degree. For\npresent purposes, however, we may view the solutions as just defined by the recursion relations (2.2.7),\ntogether with eq. (2.2.18). It follows from compatibility that these satisfy the deformation equations as\nwell.\nAs a further remark, we note that the solutions \u03a8(k) ( mod C \u03a8(0) ) associated to the f (k) s defined by\n\u221e\n\n\u221e\n\neq. (2.3.16), may be associated to any linear combination of the anti-wedge contours, used as contours\nof integration in (2.3.16). This freedom will be used in the next section.\n\n2.4\n\nDiagonalization of the Christoffel\u2013Darboux pairing\n\nWe know from Proposition 2.6 that the windows constructed from the integral representations in Proposition 2.5 provide solutions to the DDD equations for the barred system (for N > d1 ). On the other\nhand, we are guaranteed by Theorem 4.1 and Corollary 4.1 of [2] that the Christoffel\u2013Darboux pairing\nbetween such solutions and any solution of the unbarred DDD system does not depend on x, N , or the\ndeformation parameters determining the two potentials. It is of interest therefore to compute this pairing\nfor the explicit solutions at hand.\nThe solutions of the unbarred DDD equations are obtained by taking suitable windows in the wavevector solutions of eq. (2.2.7), consisting of the quasipolynomials \u03a8(0) (x) and the solutions \u03a8(k) (x)\n\u221e\n\n\u221e\n\nassociated to the f (k) (eq. 2.3.16). It should be clear that the diagonalization of the pairing depends\non a careful choice of the contours of integration in eqs. (2.3.2), (2.3.16). Here we prove that the choice\nof contours that diagonalizes the pairing (2.1.58) is linked to the notion of dual steepest descent-ascent\ncontours, whose definition is given here and will be needed again in the following section.\n\n21\n\n\fDefinition 2.4 The steepest descent contours (SDC's) and the dual steepest ascent contours (SAC's) for\nintegrals of the form\nI(x) :=\n\nZ\n\ndy e\n\n1\n\u2212~\n(V2 (y)\u2212xy)\n\ne\nI(x)\n:=\n\nH(y) ,\n\n\u0393\n\nZ\n\n1\n\ndy e ~ (V2 (y)\u2212xy) H(y) ,\n\n(2.4.1)\n\ne\n\u0393\n\nrespectively, passing through any saddle point yk (x), k = 0 . . . d2 \u2212 1 with H(y) at most of exponential\n\ntype, are the contours \u03b3k and \u03b3\u0303k , respectively, uniquely defined by\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2\n\u03b3k := y \u2208 C; I(V2 (y) \u2212 xy) = I (V2 (yk (x)) \u2212 xyk (x)) , R(V2 (y)) y\u2212\u2192\n+\u221e\n\u2192\u221e\n\uf8f3\ny \u2208 \u03b3k\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2\n\u03b3\nek := y \u2208 C; I(V2 (y) \u2212 xy) = I (V2 (yk (x)) \u2212 xyk (x)) , R(V2 (y)) y\u2212\u2192\n\u2212\u221e\n\u2192\u221e\n\uf8f3\ny\u2208e\n\u03b3k\n\nHere yk (x) denotes one of the d2 branches of the solution to the algebraic equation\n\n\uf8fc\n\uf8fd\n\n\uf8fe\n\uf8fc\n\uf8fd\n\uf8fe\n\nV2\u2032 (y) = x ,\n\n(2.4.2)\n\n.\n\n(2.4.3)\n\n(2.4.4)\n\nwhich behaves like\n\u2212 d1\n\nyk (x) \u223c (vd2 +1 )\nx\u2192\u221e\n\n2\n\n1\n\n\u03c9 k x d2 ,\n\n2i\u03c0\n\n\u03c9 := e d2 ,\n\n(2.4.5)\n\n1\n\nwhere x d2 denotes the principal d2 -th root of x.

Notice that the pairing of these integrals is also independent of\nthe deformation parameters determining V1 , V2 , as well as of the choice of the integer N defining the\n\nwindow. As shown in [2], this can always be accomplished through a suitable choice of basis. But here\nwe have explicitly shown how this occurs for the particular normalizations chosen in the integrals.\n\n3\n\nAsymptotic behavior at infinity and Riemann\u2013Hilbert problem\n24\n\n\f3.1\n\nStokes sectors and sectorial asymptotics\n\nGiven the duality between the ODE's involving D1 N and D1 N implied by eq. (2.1.60), it is clear that the\nStokes matrices around the irregular singularity at x = \u221e for systems of the form (2.1.38) and (2.1.39)\n\nare related. Using the explicit integral representations of the fundamental solutions, we can determine\nthe asymptotic behavior from these integral representations by saddle point methods. The solutions for\nN\n\nthe D1 system are simpler to analyze and do not involve the problems of divergent integrals discussed in\nthe section 2.3 (and the Appendix). But in principle one could consider the asymptotic behavior of the\nsolutions to the system (2.1.38) directly, by taking suitable windows in the wave-vector solutions of eq.\n(2.2.7).\nRemark 3.1 We have seen in Sect. 2.4 that one can choose the wave-vector solutions to eqs.

Since the asymptotic forms are mutual inverses, the Stokes (and jump) matrices\nN\n\nN\n\nfor the one must be the inverses of those for the other. (In our conventions, the Stokes matrices for \u03a6(x)\nact on the left, while for \u03a8(x) they act on the right.) The formulation for the dual wave-functions is\nN\nconsiderably easier, so this is what we analyze here in detail.\nN\n\nFrom the general theory of ODE's, since the matrix D 1 (x) is of degree d1 , one would expect d1 + 1\nStokes sectors. However, this is true only if the leading term of the matrix has a nondegenerate spectrum.\nIn the case at hand, however, we have\n\n\uf8ee\n\nN\n\uf8ef\nD1 (x) \u223c xd1 \uf8ef\n\uf8f0\n\n1\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n\uf8f9\n\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa + O(xd1 \u22121 ) .\n\uf8fb\n\n(3.1.2)\n\nSince the spectrum of the leading term has a d2 -fold degeneracy, we have more complicated asymptotic\nbehavior and the occurrence of more Stokes sectors.\nA few more preparatory remarks are required.

The reason why the Sk 's are Stokes sectors and the proper\nconstruction of the steepest descent contours is delayed to the discussion of the Stokes' matrices in Sect.\n\n3.2. We Fourier-Laplace transform the quasipolynomials \u03c6n (y) along these contours in order to obtain\n(x)'s\nthe functions \u03c6n (x). Notice that they are not necessarily the same as the previously introduced \u03c6(k)\nn\n(y)\n\nsince the steepest descent contours do not necessarily coincide with the contours \u0393k defined previously.\nHowever they are suitable linear combinations with integer coefficients of such \u03c6n(k) (x)'s since the choice of\nthe steepest descent contours is just a different basis in the homology space of the y-plane.

D.\n\n31\n\n\f3.2\n\nStokes Matrices for the Fourier\u2013Laplace transforms\nN\n\nThe fundamental solution of the system D 1 is formed from d2 Fourier-Laplace transforms \u03a6(k) (x), k =\nN\n\n1, . . . d2 , and one Hilbert-Fourier-Laplace transform \u03a6(0) (x). The asymptotic behavior of the d2 FL\ntransforms is analyzed by means of the steepest descent method in each of the sectors Sk , k = 0, . . . 2d2 +1\nN\n\n(2.4.6), while the behavior of the (piecewise) analytic function \u03a6(0) (x) is obtained (in each D\u03bc ) from eq.\n(y)\n\n(y)\n\n(3.1.30). The computation is achieved by expressing the change of homology basis from the \u03931 , . . . , \u0393d2\n\ncontours to the steepest descent contours. In order to simplify the analysis of the Stokes matrices we\npoint out that there is no essential loss of generality in assuming V2 (y) = y d2 +1 d21+1 . Indeed, we are\nconcerned with just the homology classes of the SDC's, and as x \u2192 \u221e the d2 solutions of the equation\n\nV2\u2032 (y) = x entering Def. 2.4 are distinct and asymptotic to the d2 roots of x (up to a nonzero factor). The\n\nparticular choice of the leading coefficient is also essentially irrelevant. If we choose a different coefficient,\nwe must just appropriately rotate by \u03b8 = arg(vd2 +1 )/(d2 + 1) counterclockwise in the pictures to follow,\nbut without any essential difference. Therefore, we proceed with vd2 +1 set equal to unity.\nWith these simplifications, the Stokes phenomenon can be studied directly on the integrals\n\u0014\n\u0012 d+1\n\u0013\u0015\nZ\nZ\n\u0010 d+1\n\u0011\n1\nz\n\u22121 y\n\u2212xy\ndz exp \u2212\u039b\ndy e ~ d+1\n\u2212 ei\u03b1 z\n,\n= |x| d\nd+1\n\n(3.2.1)\n\nwhere\n\n1 d+1\n(3.2.2)\n|x| d , \u03b1 := arg(x) ,\n~\nand, in order to avoid too many subscripts in the formulae to follow, we have here, and for the remainder\n\u039b :=\n\n1\n\nof this section, have set d = d2 . Disregarding the positive factor |x| d , which is inessential for these\nconsiderations, the integrals in (3.2.2) can be written as\n\u0014\n\u0012 d+1\n\u0013\u0015 Z\nZ\nz\ndz\ni\u03b1\ndz exp \u2212\u039b\n\u2212e z\n= ds e\u2212\u039bs ,\nd+1\nds\n\n(3.2.3)\n\nwhere z = Z(s) is the D + 1-valued inverse to\ns = S(z) :=\n\nz d+1\n\u2212 ei\u03b1 z , z = Z(s).\nd+1\n\n(3.2.4)\n\nIt defines a (d + 1)-fold covering of the s-plane branching around the points (z, s) whose projection on\nthe s-plane are the d critical values\n(j)\ns(j)\ncr = scr (\u03b1) = \u2212\n\n2i\u03c0\nd i (d+1)\u03b1 j\ne d \u03c9 , \u03c9 := e d ,\nd+1\n\nj = 0, . . . , d \u2212 1.\n\n(3.2.5)\n\nIn realizing this d + 1-fold covering, we take the branch cuts on the s-plane to be the rays I(s) =\n(j)\n\nI(scr ) =const, extending to R(s) = +\u221e. As \u039b \u2192 +\u221e the integrals (3.2.2) have leading asymptotic\nbehavior that depends only on the critical values of the map s(z) and on the homology class of the\ncontour.\n32\n\n\fWe now return to the computation of the Stokes' lines. By the definition of the SDC's \u03b3k (Def.\n2.4, with V2 (y) now taken as just y d+1 /(d + 1)), their image in the s-plane consists of contours which\ncome from R(s) = +\u221e on one side of the branch-cut (and on the appropriate sheet) and go back to\nR(s) = +\u221e on the other side of the branch-cut, on the same sheet. (For the SAC's, we choose cuts\n\nextending to R(s) = \u2212\u221e.) The cuts on the s-plane may overlap only for those values of \u03b1 = arg(x) for\n(i)\n\n(j)\n\nwhich the imaginary parts of two different critical values scr (\u03b1) and scr (\u03b1) coincide. A straightforward\ncomputation, with our simplifying assumptions on V2 (y), yields the lines separating the sectors Sk to be\nthose defined in eqs. (2.4.6) (with d2 replaced by d and \u03b8 = 0).\nWe also need the following.\nDefinition 3.1 For a given sector S, of width A < \u03c0, centered around a ray arg(x) = \u03b10 , the dual\n\nsector S \u2228 is the sector centered around the ray arg(x) = \u2212\u03b10 + \u03c0, with width \u03c0 \u2212 A.\n\n(y)\n\nFor x \u2192 \u221e in each sector the SDC's are constant integral linear combinations of the contours \u0393k 's. When\n\nx crosses the Stokes line between two adjacent sectors, the homology of the SDC's changes discontinuously.\n(k)\n\nWe denote the SDC's relative to the sector Sk by \u03b3j , j = 0 . . . d \u2212 1, and denote the column vector with\n(y)\nthese as entries ~\u03b3 (k) , and similarly, let ~\u0393 denote the column vector with entries {\u0393j }j=1...d . Denoting\nthe matrix of change of basis by Ck , we have\n\n~\u03b3 (k) = Ck ~\u0393 , Ck \u2208 GL(d, Z) .\n\n(3.2.6)\n\nOur first objective is to compute these matrices Ck . For each fixed generic \u03b1 (i.e. away from the\nStokes' lines), we can construct a diagram (essentially a Hurwitz diagram) which describes the sheet\nstructure of the inverse map z = Z(s). We draw d + 1 identical ordered d-gons each representing a\n(j)\n\ncopy of the s-plane and whose (labeled) vertices represent the projections of the d critical values scr .\nTwo vertices with the same label of two different d-gons are joined by a segment if the two sheets are\nglued together along a horizontal branch-cut originating at the corresponding critical value and going to\nR(s) = +\u221e. Since all the branch-points of the inverse map are of order 2, there are at most two sheets\nglued along each cut. Furthermore we give an orientation to the segments (represented by an arrow) with\n\nthe understanding that this gives an orientation to the corresponding SDC. The convention is that an\narrow going from sheet j to sheet k means that the SDC runs on sheet j coming from R(s) = +\u221e below\n\nthe cut and goes back above the same cut (or, what is \"homologically\" the same, the contour runs on\nsheet k coming from +\u221e above the cut and returns to +\u221e below it).\nThe diagram can be uniquely associated to a matrix Qk of size d \u00d7 (d + 1), in which each row\n\ncorresponds to a SDC and each column to a sheet.

The labeling of each\nsheet is given by the boldface numbers and corresponds to the labels inside the endecagons appearing in\nthe extended Hurwitz diagrams below the corresponding z-planes. The intermediate Hurwitz diagram\nrepresents the gluing of the sheets after crossing the intermediate Stokes line, i.e., after incrementing \u03b1\nby \u03c0/12.\n0 otherwise.\nHence each row of the matrix has exactly one +1 and one \u22121 entry.\n34\n\n\fIn Fig. 4, we indicate, for the case d = 11, \u03b1 = 0, the SDS contours and sheet structure represented\nby the extended Hurwitz diagram.

Since \u03b1 = arg(x) ranges within a fixed sector Sk ,\n\nthe diagram does not change topology and the corresponding matrix Qk remains unchanged.\n\nWe can now describe how a given diagram changes when \u03b1 = arg(x) crosses the line between two\nadjacent sectors Sk and Sk+1 (counterclockwise). These lines correspond precisely to the values of \u03b1 for\nwhich two distinct critical values have the same imaginary parts (so that the cuts may overlap if they\n\nare on the same sheet). We leave to the reader to check that these lines are precisely the boundaries of\nthe Stokes sectors Sk defined in eq. (2.4.6). As \u03b1 increases by \u03c0/(d + 1) from Sk to Sk+1 . the d-gons\n\nrotate by \u03c0/d. In this process the connections between the sheets change according to the following rule:\nif the branch-point Pj on sheet r crosses the cut originating from a different branch-point Ph on the\n\nsame sheet (on the left of Pj on sheet r, and hence Pj crosses the cut from below as it moves upwards),\nthen the Pj (and its cut) jumps to the sheet s which is glued to sheet r along the cut originating at\nPh (see Fig. 5). Diagrammatically, the tip (or the tail) of the corresponding arrow moves from one\nd-gon to another one connected along the vertex h. In terms of the matrix Qk , the j-th row reflects\n(k)\n\nalong the hyperplane orthogonal to the h-th row. The homology class of the SDC \u03b3h\n\nwill then change\n\nbecause the branch-cut attached to Pj which \"emerges\" from the branch cut attached to Ph \"extracts\" a\n(k)\n\ncontribution proportional to \u03b3j . The proportionality factor is \u00b11 depending on the relative orientations.\n\nThe corresponding SDC's\n\n(k)\n\u03b3j\n\n(k)\n\nand \u03b3h\n\n(k+1)\n\nare related to the SDC's \u03b3j\n= \u03b3j\n\n(k+1)\n\n= \u03b3h + \u01ebhj \u03b3j\n\n\u03b3h\n\nby the relations\n\n(k)\n\n(k+1)\n\n\u03b3j\n\n(k+1)\n\nand \u03b3h\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\nwhere the incidence number \u01ebhj = \u01ebjh is 1 if the SDC's \u03b3j , \u03b3h\n\n(3.2.8)\n\nhave the opposite orientation and \u22121 if\n\nthey have the same orientation. Alternatively, the incidence number is just the (standard) inner product\nof the corresponding rows h, j of the matrix Qk .\n35\n\n\fPh\n\nPh\n\nPj\nSheet r\n\nSheet r\n\nJum\n\nps o\n\nf she\n\net\nPj\n\nPh\n\nPh\nSheet s\n\nSheet s\n\nBefore crossing\n\nAfter crossing\n\nFigure 5: The crossing of two critical values and the corresponding cuts.\nWe denote by Mk the d \u00d7 d matrix which expresses the changes in the SDC's described by eq. (3.2.8)\n\nthrough the relation\n\n~\u03b3 (k+1) = Mk~\u03b3 (k) .\n\n(3.2.9)\n\nThese will be seen presently to be precisely the Stokes matrices for the passage between these sectors.\nOne can check that the matrices Qk and Qk+1 are related by\nQk+1 = Mkt\n\n\u22121\n\nQk .\n\n(3.2.10)\n\nTherefore we can reconstruct the matrices Mk once we have an initial diagram representing the sheet\nstructure.\nBefore constructing the initial diagram, we note that when \u03b1 increases by 2\u03c0/(d + 1) (i.e. when we\ncross two Stokes lines), the steepest descent (unoriented) contours are like the original ones, but rotated\nby the same amount clockwise. That is, the unoriented diagram (i.e. forgetting the orientation of the\nSDC's) is the same, up to cyclically permuting the labels of the (d + 1) sheets and the d cuts. Note also\nthat the critical points rotate by\n\n2\u03c0\nd(d+1)\n\nand the critical values by\n\n2\u03c0\nd\n\ncounterclockwise. Indeed we have\n\n\u0013\n\u0012\n2\u03c0\n2\u03c0\nz d+1\n2\u03c0\n=\ns z; \u03b1 +\n\u2212 ei\u03b1 ei d+1 z = s(ei d+1 z; \u03b1) .\nd+1\nd+1\n\n(3.2.11)\n(d\u22121)\n\nAs for the orientation of the SDC's relative to the new labeling, the d-th SDC passing through zcr\n\nreverses its orientation relative to the (oriented) SDC's obtained by just rotating the initial SDC's (see\nFigure 4). This implies that the matrices Qk representing the diagrams in the various sectors and the\nStokes' matrices Mk satisfy the recursion relations\nQk+2 = p\u22121 Qk Sd+1 ,\n\nMk+2 = p * Mk * p\u22121\n\n36\n\n(3.2.12)\n\n\fSd+1\n\n\uf8ee\n\n0 0\n1 0\n0 1\n\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n=\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8f0 0 0\n0 0\n\n\uf8f9\n0 1\n0 0 \uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n0 0 \uf8fa\n\uf8fa \u2208 GL(d + 1, Z) ,\n. \uf8fa\n0 .. \uf8fb\n*** 1 0\n***\n***\n***\n..\n.\n\n\uf8ee\n\n0 0\n1 0\n0 1\n\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef\np := \uf8ef\n\uf8ef\n\uf8f0 0 0\n0 0\n\nIt is therefore only necessary to compute Q0 , Q1 and M0 , M1 .\n\n\uf8f9\n0 \u22121\n0 0 \uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n0 0 \uf8fa\n\uf8fa \u2208 GL(d, Z)\n\uf8fa\n0 0 \uf8fb\n*** 1 0\n\n***\n***\n***\n..\n.\n\n(y)\n\nNotice also that the wedge contours \u0393j , j = 0, . . . , d are in 1 \u2212 1 correspondence with the sheets\n\nof the map Z(s). Indeed, each connected component to the right of the wedge contours contains only\n(y)\n\none sector S2k+1 in the z-plane which corresponds to the sector R(s) < 0 in the s-plane.

(3.2.12) and P in eq. (3.2.13) generate a representation of the cyclic\ngroup Zd+1 (although P is of size d \u00d7 d). The matrix P is just the generator of Zd+1 on the \"wedge\"\nPd\n(y)\ncontours; i.e. with the additional constraint i=0 \u0393i = 0.\nWe now describe how to derive the initial diagram - for example, how Figure 4 is obtained. We start\n(y)\n\nby noting that the \"wedge\" contours \u0393k\n\nenclose the sector S2k\u22121 of width \u03c0/(d + 1). It is to see that\n\nthe corresponding integrals are (more than) exponentially decreasing in the dual sector, since\nZ\n\n(y)\n\u0393k\n\ne\u2212 ~ ( y\n1\n\nwhere M is the supremum of\n(y)\n\nd+1\n\n/(d+1)\u2212xy )\n\n1\n|x| R(xy)\n\ndy \u2264 exp (|x|M )\n(y)\n\nZ\n\n(y)\n\u0393k\n\n1\n\ne\u2212 ~ y\n\nd+1\n\n/(d+1)\n\ndy ,\n\n(3.2.14)\n\n(y)\n\nas y goes along \u0393k . Now the contour \u0393k can be deformed so as\n\nto approach the sector S2k\u22121 as closely as we wish. Then the constant M is finite and negative if x lies\n(y) \u2228\n\nwithin the dual sector Sk\n\n.\n\nWe now consider the case of odd d, leaving the easy generalization to even d's to the reader. (The\n\nonly difference is that for odd d, \u03b1 = arg(x) = 0 is not a Stokes' line. To study the case even d case, one\nshould choose a convenient initial value of \u03b1 (e.g. \u03b1 = \u01eb \u226a 1 or \u03b1 = \u03c0/2(d + 1), which corresponds to an\nanti\u2013Stokes line).\n\nLet us start with the (non-Stokes) value \u03b1 = 0 and focus on any of the SDC's attached to a critical\nvalue lying in the right s-plane for this value of \u03b1 (remembering that d is assumed to be odd). Since\nd\nthe real part of such a critical value is positive, the corresponding integrals decrease as exp(\u2212 d+1\n\u03c9 j \u039b),\n\n(\u039b :=\n\nd+1\n1\nd )\n~ |x|\n\ni.e., they are (more than) exponentially suppressed on the line x \u2208 R+ . As we increase\n37\n\n\f\u03b1, the d-gons rotate by\n\nd+1\nd \u03b1\n\ncounterclockwise. It should be clear (from the previous description of the\n\nchange of homology of the SDC's) that the SDC's attached to such critical values do not change homology\nclass while they remain in the right half of the s-plane. This is so because there are no branch points to\ntheir right which can pass through the branch-cut through the given saddle point (which extends to the\nright) as \u03b1 is increased. Therefore the corresponding integrals are exponentially suppressed as long as \u03b1\nranges in a corresponding sector of width\nto a sector of width\n\n\u03c0\nd+1 ;\n6\n\nd\nd+1 \u03c0\n\n1\n= \u03c0 \u2212 d+1\n\u03c0. This is precisely the width of the dual sector\n(y)\n\ni.e., the width of any of the S2k+1 's. By careful inspection of the anti-Stokes\n\nlines for these integrals , which correspond to the value of \u03b1 for which the corresponding critical value is\n(y)\n\nreal and positive, one concludes that they coincide with an appropriate \u0393k in the left half of the z-plane.\n(y)\n\nThis argument proves that all \"wedge\" contours \u0393k\n\nlying in the left plane are homological to SDC's.\n\n(These are the SDC's in the left z-plane in Figure 4.)\nWe then take the first critical value lying in the left half of the s-plane (in Figure 4, the SDC number\n9). As we increase \u03b1 so as to move this critical value to the right half of the s-plane, the corresponding\nSDC can acquire a contribution only from the first SDC in the left half-plane (number 8 in our example).\n\u03c0\n.\nAs a consequence the corresponding integral is exponentially suppressed in a sector of width \u03c0 \u2212 2 d+1\n\nConsidering its anti-Stokes line and its linear independence from the previously identified SDC's, we\nconclude that it must enclose two odd-numbered sectors S2k+1 and S2k+3 (in our example this is contour\n9). Proceeding this way we can easily identify the homology classes of all SDC's for \u03b1 = 0.\nThe labeling of the sheets is largely arbitrary. (The choice we have made in the fig. 4 is just for\n(y)\n\n(k)\n\n\"aesthetic\" reasons). The fixed basis of contours \u0393i , i = 1, . . . d and the bases \u03b3j , j = 0, . . . d \u2212 1 k =\n\n0, . . . 2d + 1 are related by\n\n~\u03b3 (k) = Ck ~\u0393 = Mk\u22121 * * * M0 C0 ~\u0393\n\n~\u03b3 (0) = C0 ~\u0393 .\n\n(3.2.15)\n(3.2.16)\n\nTherefore only the matrices Mk and the first change of basis matrix C0 are needed. The matrix C0\ncan easily be constructed from the initial sheet structure. For our present purposes it is not actually\nnecessary to have its general form, since the objects of primary interest are the Stokes matrices, which\nwill be seen to be just the Mk 's. But to illustrate by example the form that C0 takes, within the basis\n6 The anti-Stokes' line for exponential integrals of the type of Def. 2.4 are the lines along which the integrals are most\nrapidly decreasing as |x| \u2192 \u221e.\n\n38\n\n\fwe have chosen, for the case d = 11, it is:\n\uf8ee\n1\n\uf8ef 0\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef 0\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef 0\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef 0\n\uf8ef\nC0 := \uf8ef\n\uf8ef 0\n\uf8ef 0\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef 0\n\uf8ef\n\uf8ef 0\n\uf8ef\n\uf8f0 0\n0\n\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n1\n1\n1\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n1\n1\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n0\n0\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n0\n0\n1\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n1\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n1\n\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n0\n1\n\n\uf8f9\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8fb\n\n(3.2.17)\n\nIt is not difficult to give an explicit description of the matrices Q0 , Q1 and M0 , M1 but, for the sake of\nbrevity, we will not give it here. It consists of a lengthy but straightforward calculation, which leads\nto the matrices in Table 1 (listed for the cases d = 2, . . . , 11), where one can clearly extrapolate to the\ncorrect rule.\nWe now turn our attention to the Stokes matrices.

If we denote by\nN\n(y)\nY (x) the d2 \u00d7 d2 such block whose rows are the integrals of \u03c6(y) on the contours \u0393k , and by Yk (x) the\nanalogous matrix obtained by integrating over the SDC's, we have\nYk (x) = Ck Y (x).\n\n(3.2.18)\n\nSk := Yk+1 Yk \u22121 = Ck+1 Ck \u22121 = Mk .\n\n(3.2.19)\n\nThe Stokes matrices are then given by\n\nThese are just the matrices expressing the relative change of homology basis of the SDC's corresponding\nto two consecutive Stokes' sectors.\nIn order to complete the description of the Riemann\u2013Hilbert problem, we need to also consider the\nextra solution given by a Hilbert\u2013Fourier-Laplace transform.

However, we could alternatively have formulated an equivalent Riemann\u2013Hilbert\nproblem, in which the lines L\u03bc define discontinuities, according to eq. (3.1.6), by retaining a fixed choice\nof the contours of integration along the boundaries of the wedge sectors, thereby giving rise to genuine\njump discontinuities across the boundaries.\n41\n\n\f4\n\nSummary and comments on large N asymptotics in multimatrix models\n\nA complete formulation of the Riemann\u2013Hilbert problem characterizing fundamental systems of solutions\nto the differential - recursion equations satisfied by biorthogonal polynomials associated to 2-matrix\nmodels with polynomial potentials is provided in Theorem 3.1. The approach derived here can also be\nextended quite straightforwardly to the case of biorthogonal polynomials associated to a finite chain of\ncoupled matrices with polynomial potentials, following the lines indicated in the appendix of [2].\nThe Riemann-Hilbert data, consisting essentially of the Stokes matrices at \u221e, are independent of\n\nboth the integer parameter N corresponding to the matrix size and the deformation parameters determining the potentials; that is, the fundamental solutions constructed are solutions simultaneously of a\ndifferential-difference generalized isomonodromic deformation problem. This provides the first main step\n\ntowards a rigorous analysis of the N \u2192 \u221e, ~ N = O(1) limit of the partition function and the Fredholm\n\nkernels determining the spectral statistics of coupled random matrices (essential, e.g., to the question of\nuniversality in 2-matrix models). Such an analysis should follow similar lines to those previously successfully applied to ordinary orthogonal polynomials in the 1-matrix case [6, 17, 19, 20, 10, 11]. The main\ndifference in the 2-(or more) matrix case is that in the double\u2013scaling limit the functional dependence\nof the free energy on the eigenvalue distributions is not as explicit as in the 1-matrix models [23, 18].\nIt is also clear that the hyperelliptic spectral curve that arises in the solution of the one-matrix model\nmust be replaced by a more general algebraic curve, which arises naturally in the spectral duality of the\nspectral curves of [2] (cf. [14]).\nIn order determine the large N asymptotics with the help of the data defining the Riemann-Hilbert\nproblem, one should begin with an ansatz that can be checked a posteriori against the given case. In the\n1-matrix case [10, 11], this was provided by means of hyperelliptic \u0398-functions. The physical heuristics\nand the basic tools for generating such ansatz were also given in [7, 14, 23, 18]. Much of of these heuristics\ncan be extended to the 2-matrix case [4], and this will be the subject of a subsequent work [1].\n\nA\n\nAppendix: Convergent integral representations of \u03a8(x)\n\u221e\n\nIn this appendix, we indicate how to overcome the problem in the formal definition of eq. (2.3.15),\nillustrated through an example. The idea follows that used in [21] for the case of cubic potentials7 .\nAs discussed in section \u03a8(0) (x), a natural approach to finding solutions of eq.

Therefore, we just give an indication of how to proceed by means of an example.\n\nA.1\n\nAn Example: d1 = 7, d2 = 4\n\nThe example we consider consists of two potentials V1 (x) and V2 (y) of degrees 8 and 5 respectively, both\nwith positive real leading coefficients.
