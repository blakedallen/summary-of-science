The common accepted paradigm is the\nexistence of an exotic weakly interacting massive particle (WIMP). Such a particle has to be found in some extension\nof the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics. Supersymmetry and extra space-time dimensions are commonly\nused ingredients for a consistent theory beyond the SM. One the most studied framework is the MSSM, the minimal\nsupersymmetric extension of the SM. In the MSSM the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) is usually a neutralino,\nwhich is a good candidate for cold dark matter (for a recent review see [1]). The pattern of the soft supersymmetry\nbreaking terms and the presence of extra space-time dimensions greatly affects the composition and the strength of\nthe dominant interactions of the neutralino. Hence it is crucial to study the neutralino phenomenology in different\nscenarios. The GLAST experiment will have a great chance to shed light on the nature of dark matter, for example\nthrough the analysis of the continuum \u03b3 -ray flux supposed to come from pair WIMP annihilations.\n\nEXPLORING THE CMSSM WITH GLAST\nOne of the most studied supersymmetric scenario is the constrained MSSM (CMSSM) in which the soft supersymmetry breaking terms are supposed to derive from a high energy supergravity theory with a common scalar mass m0 and\na common gaugino mass m1/2 at the GUT scale. In this framework the neutralino is the LSP in most of the parameter\nspace. It can be studied through indirect detection of \u03b3 -rays from pair annihilation. The expected \u03b3 -ray continuum flux\nat a given photon energy E from a direction that form an angle \u03c8 is given by\n\n\u03c6\u03c7 (E, \u03c8 ) =\n\n\u03c3 v dN f\nBf\n4\u03c0 \u2211\nf dE\n\nZ\n\nl.o.s\n\ndl(\u03c8 )\n\n1 \u03c1 (l)2\n2 m2\u03c7\n\n(1)\n\nIt depends on the particle physics model assumed through the neutralino mass m\u03c7 , the total annihilation cross section\n\u03c3 v and through the sum of all the photon yield dN f /dE per each annihilation channel weighted by the corresponding\nbranching ratio B f . The flux (1) also depends on the WIMP density in the galactic halo \u03c1 (l). The integral has to be\nperformed along the line of sight (l.o.s.). The WIMP density profiles \u03c1 (l) are in general extremely cuspy towards the\ngalactic center (GC) that hence is a good place where to look for an exotic signal. In our analysis we take into account\nthe Navarro, Frenck and White (NFW) profile [2] and the Moore profile [3]. The usual parametrization for a dark\nmatter halo density is\n\u03c10\n\u03c1 (r) =\n.\n(2)\n(r/R)\u03b3 [1 + (r/R)\u03b1 ](\u03b2 \u2212\u03b3 )/\u03b1\n\n\ftan\u03b2 =55, A0=0, sgn(\u03bc)=0\n1200\nm \u03c7 =500 GeV\n\nMoore\n\nm1/2 (GeV)\n\n1000\n\n800\n\n600\n\nm \u03c7 =350 GeV\n\nNFW\n\n400\nm \u03c7 =200 GeV\n\n200\nm \u03c7 =100 GeV\n\n1000\n\n2000\n\n3000\n\n4000\n\n5000\n\nm 0 (GeV)\nFIGURE 1. GLAST reach in the CMSSM parameter space\n\nThe NFW profile behaves like r\u22121 towards the GC while the Moore profile goes as r\u22121.5 . In general one expects also\ncontributions coming from standard astrophysical sources. In many diffuse continuum \u03b3 -ray production models [4] in\nour galaxy, the dominant astrophysical contribution comes from \u03c0 0 \u2192 2\u03b3 . This has to be considered the \"standard\"\nbackground. We performed a statistical analysis, based on the usual \u03c7 2 test, in order to determine what are the models\nthat can be disentangled against the\n\u221a background by GLAST at a given significance [5]. We have taken into account\nonly the statistical errors, i.e. \u03c3 = Nb where Nb is the number of background photons in each energy bin.\nDoing a detailed scan of the CMSSM parameter space defined by m0 , m1/2 , tan \u03b2 , A0 and sign(\u03bc ) one can find the\nregions that are detectable by GLAST. Besides the previously explained parameters m0 , m1/2 , tan \u03b2 denotes the ratio\nof the vacuum expectation values of the two neutral components of the SU(2) Higgs doublet, A0 is the proportionality\nfactor between the supersymmetry breaking trilinear couplings and the Yukawa couplings while \u03bc is determined (up\nto a sign) by imposing the Electro-Weak Symmetry Breaking (EWSB) conditions at the weak scale.\nThe result, at a 3\u03c3 confidence level, for tan \u03b2 = 55 case is shown in fig. 1. We assumed a total exposure of\n3.7 \u00d7 1010 cm2 s, an angular resolution (at 10 GeV) of \u223c 3 \u00d7 10\u22125 sr and 4 years of data taking [6].\nBlue solid lines represent the GLAST reach for a NWF and Moore profile while dashed lines represent the neutralino\nisomass contours (expressed in GeV). Gray shaded regions are parameter space regions excluded by either theoretical\nor experimental (accelerator) constraints. The upper left region is excluded because the lightest stau is the LSP, the\nlower left region is excluded due the accelerator bounds on the Higgs boson masses, b \u2192 s\u03b3 , slepton and squark\nmasses, etc., while the right lower region is excluded because there is no electroweak symmetry breaking. The WMAP\ncompatible region (with relic density 0.09 \u2264 \u03a9h2 \u2264 0.13) is the red one while in the green region the neutralino is a\nsubdominant dark matter component (with \u03a9h2 \u2264 0.09).\n\nEXTRA DIMENSIONS AND GLAST\nIn recent times many scenarios involving extra space-time dimensions with or even without supersymmetry received\ngreat attention. It is very interesting to see if GLAST is able to detect signals in this context. We consider a very wide\nscenario involving extra dimensions and low energy supersymmetry [7].\nIn this framework there are three additional parameters, namely the typical size of extra dimensions \u03bc0 = R\u22121 , their\nnumber \u03b4 and the number \u03b7 of fermion generations that are allowed to have extra Kaluza-Klein (KK) states. The most\n\n\f\u03bc 0 =10 TeV, \u03b4=2, \u03b7=0 tan\u03b2 =10, A0=0, sgn(\u03bc)=0\n2000\nm \u03c7 =1 TeV\n\n1750\n\nm1/2 (GeV)\n\n1500\n1250\n\nMoore\n1000\nm \u03c7 =500 GeV\n\n750\n500\n\nm \u03c7 =200 GeV\n\n250\n\nNFW\n250\n\n500\n\n750 1000 1250 1500 1750 2000\n\nm 0 (GeV)\nFIGURE 2.\n\nGLAST reach for the extra dimensional scenario with \u03bc0 = 10 TeV, \u03b4 = 2 and \u03b7 = 0\n\nstriking feature in this class of models is the presence of power-law corrections to all the couplings and masses of the\nMSSM [8]. This implies that one can have a grand unification scale (GUT) scale as low as few TeV. From the point of\nview of indirect detection the case \u03b7 > 0 in which some fermion generation have KK tower is disfavored. Thus in the\nfollowing we concentrate on the minimal case \u03b7 = 0. Moreover the number of extra dimensions \u03b4 does not seem to be\ncrucial for the neutralino phenomenology [7]. In almost all the parameter space the neutralino is still the LSP. One of\nthe main result is that, unlike the standard CMSSM case, the neutralino is no longer bino-like but it tends to be a very\npure higgsino. In general this result holds for not too high compactification scale \u03bc0 . 100 TeV while going towards\nhigher scale the neutralino tends to be a bino.\nWe show the 3\u03c3 GLAST reach (along the line sketched in the previous section) for \u03bc0 = 10 TeV, \u03b4 = 2 and \u03b7 = 0\nand for a low value of tan \u03b2 .\nThe plot assumptions and the explanation of the different regions are the same as in fig. 1. In this scenario a NFW\nprofile is not enough for GLAST to be able to explore the cosmologically favored region in which the neutralino has\na mass greater than 200 GeV. In order to do that a Moore profile is needed. This corresponds to an enhancement\nfactor of about one order of magnitude in the continuum flux. It has to be remarked that assuming some non standard\ncosmological evolution the green region could become a WMAP compatible region. This is due to a non thermal\nenhancement of the relic density (see for example [9]). These kind of scenarios are particularly motivated in scenarios\nwith extra dimensions. In fig. 3 we show the case with \u03bc0 = 105 TeV and with only one extra dimensions \u03b4 = 1. All\nthe KK particles are quite heavy in this case but the effects on the low energy theory, through one loop processes, are\nstill sizable.\nIn this scenario the GLAST reach for a NFW profile is still below the WMAP allowed region but for a Moore profile\nGLAST will be able to probe almost all the cosmologically favored region.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nWe have shown that, assuming a NFW profile, GLAST will be able to probe a huge part of the WMAP allowed zone of\nthe CMSSM parameter space especially in the high tan \u03b2 case. In the scenario involving extra dimensions, with quite\nlow compactification scale \u03bc0 . 10 TeV, GLAST will still be able to probe some part of the cosmologically favored\nregion of the parameter space either in the case of more cuspy Moore profile or in the case of an enhancement of the\n\n\f5\n\n\u03bc 0 =10 TeV, \u03b4=1, \u03b7=0 tan\u03b2 =50, A0=0, sgn(\u03bc)=0\n2000\nm \u03c7 =1 TeV\n\n1750\n\nm1/2 (GeV)\n\n1500\n1250\n\nMoore\n1000\n750\n\nNFW\n\n500\n\nm \u03c7 =500 GeV\n\n250\n\nm \u03c7 =200 GeV\n\n500\n\n1000\n\n1500\n\n2000\n\n2500\n\n3000\n\nm 0 (GeV)\nFIGURE 3.\n\nGLAST reach for the extra dimensional scenario with \u03bc0 = 105 TeV, \u03b4 = 1 and \u03b7 = 0\n\nneutralino relic density in a non standard cosmological scenario.
