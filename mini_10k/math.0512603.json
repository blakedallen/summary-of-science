In this paper we study the automorphisms group of\nsome K3 surfaces which are double covers of the projective plane\nramified over a smooth sextic plane curve. More precisely, we study\nthe case of a K3 surface of Picard rank two such that there is a\nrational curve of degree d which is tangent to the sextic in d points.\n\nIntroduction\nK3 surfaces which are double covers of the plane ramified over a plane\nsextic are classical objects. In this paper we determine the automorphisms group of some of these surfaces. More precisely, we restrict to\nthe case of Picard rank two. Moreover we suppose that there is a rational curve of degree d which is tangent to the sextic in d points. The\nresult is that K3 surfaces of this type with d odd have automorphisms\ngroup isomorphic to Z2 .\nWe first analize the case d = 3 in full details to better explain the\nresults and the methodology we have used. Then we study the case\nwith d odd for which the situation is not substantially different from\nthe previous one.\nThe automorphisms of a K3 surface are given by the Hodge isometries that preserve the K\u00e4hler cone (see [2], VIII.11). Thus, the strategy to study the automorphism of a K3 surface X is to determine its\nK\u00e4hler cone and the Hodge isometries of H 2 (X, Z) which preserve it.\nTo do this, we first determine the isometries of the N\u00e9ron-Severi lattice\nNS(X) which preserve the K\u00e4hler cone and then we study the gluing conditions on the transcendental lattice T (X), since H 2 (X, Z) =\nNS(X) \u2295 T (X).\nThe first author is supported by Progetto di Ricerca Nazionale COFIN 2004\n\"Geometria sulle Variet\u00e0 Algebriche\".\n1\n\n\f2\n\nFEDERICA GALLUZZI AND GIUSEPPE LOMBARDO\n\nIn the preliminary Section 1 we introduce some basic material on lattices and K3 surfaces. In section 2 we give explicitly the N\u00e9ron-Severi\nlattice of the K3 we are interested in. In section 3 we start our work on\nthe case d = 3 following the strategy explained before. We determine\nthe K\u00e4hler cone in Prop.3.1 and the automorhisms group of the N\u00e9ronSeveri lattice in Prop.3.2 using some basic facts on the generalized Pell\nequation a2 \u2212 13b2 = \u22124. Finally, we derive in Theorem3.3 that the\nautomorhisms group of the surface is isomorphic to Z2 analyzing the\ngluing condition on the transcendental lattice. Using similar methods\nwe obtain the same result for d odd in Theorem4.1.\n1. Preliminaries\n1.1. Lattices. A lattice is a free Z-module L of finite rank with a Zvalued symmetric bilinear form <, > . A lattice is called even if the\nquadratic form associated to the bilinear form has only even values, odd\notherwise. The discriminant d(L) is the determinant of the matrix of\nthe bilinear form. A lattice is called non-degenerate if the discriminant\nis non-zero and unimodular if the discriminant is \u00b11. If the lattice L is\nnon-degenerate, the pair (s+ , s\u2212 ), where s\u00b1 denotes the multiplicity of\nthe eigenvalue \u00b11 for the quadratic form associated to L \u2297 R, is called\nsignature of L. Finally, we call s+ + s\u2212 the rank of L.\nGiven a lattice (L, <, >) we can construct the lattice (L(m) <, >m ),\nthat is the Z-module L with form < x, y >m = m < x, y > .\nAn isometry of lattices is an isomorphism preserving the bilinear form.\nL\u2032\nis free.\nGiven a sublattice L \u0592\u2192 L\u2032 , the embedding is primitive if\nL\nTwo even lattices S, T are orthogonal if there exist an even unimodular\n\u223c\nlattice L and a primitive embedding S \u0592\u2192 L for which (S)\u22a5\nL = T.\n1.2. K3 surfaces. A K3 surface is a compact K\u00e4hler surface with\ntrivial canonical bundle and such that its first Betti number is equal\nto zero. Let U be the\n! lattice of rank two with quadratic form given\n0 1\nby the matrix\nand let E8 be the lattice of rank eight whose\n1 0\nquadratic form is the Cartan matrix of the root system of E8 . It is an\neven, unimodular and positive definite lattice.\n\n\fON THE AUTOMORPHISMS OF SOME K3 SURFACE DOUBLE COVER OF THE PLANE\n3\n\nIt is well known that H 2 (X, Z) is an even lattice of rank 22 and signature (3, 19) isomorphic to the lattice\n\u039b = U \u2295 U \u2295 U \u2295 E8 (\u22121) \u2295 E8 (\u22121),\n\nthat we will call, from now on, the K3\u2212lattice. Denote with NS(X) \u223c\n=\n2\n1,1\nH (X, Z) \u2229 H (X) the N\u00e9ron-Severi lattice of X and with T (X) the\northogonal complement of NS(X) in H 2 (X, Z). The Picard rank of\nX, \u03c1(X), is the rank of NS(X). The Hodge Index Theorem implies\nthat NS(X) has signature (1, \u03c1(X) \u2212 1) and that T (X) has signature\n(2, 20 \u2212 \u03c1(X)).\nWe will use the following result:\n\nTheorem 1.1. [6, Thm. 1.14.4][5, 2.9] If \u03c1(X) \u2264 10, then every even\nlattice S of signature (1, \u03c1 \u2212 1) occurs as the N\u00e9ron-Severi group of\nsome K3 surface and the primitive embedding S \u0592\u2192 \u039b is unique.\nDenote with \u2206 the set of the classes of the (\u22122)-curves in NS(X) and\nwith C \u2282 NS(X) \u2297 R the connected component of the set of elements\nx \u2208 NS(X) \u2297 R with x2 > 0 which contains an ample divisor. The\nK\u00e4hler cone is the convex subcone of C defined as\nC + = {y \u2208 C : (y, d) > 0 for all d \u2208 NS(X), d effective}.\nWe will also use the following\nProposition 1.2. [2, VIII 3.8.] The K\u00e4hler cone is given by\nC + = {w \u2208 C : wN > 0, for all N \u2208 \u2206}.\n2. The surfaces Xd\nIt is well known that a surface which is a double cover of the projective\nplane ramified over a smooth sextic plane curve is a K3 surface. We\nrestrict to the case when the N\u00e9ron-Severi lattice has rank two and\nsuch that there is a rational curve of degree d which is tangent to the\nsextic in d points. Let Xd be such a surface. We suppose that Xd is\ngeneral. The N\u00e9ron-Severi lattice of Xd has quadratic form given by\n!\n2 d\n.\nQd :=\nd \u22122\n\n\f4\n\nFEDERICA GALLUZZI AND GIUSEPPE LOMBARDO\n\nWe denote this lattice Ld . It is has segnature (1, 1).\nOur aim is to compute the automorphisms group of Xd We start with\nthe case d = 3.\n3. Case d = 3\nWe want to study now the automorphisms group of a K3 surface X3 of\nrank two which is a double cover of the plane ramified over a smooth\nsextic which has a rational tritangent cubic. Such a surface has a\nN\u00e9ron-Severi lattice L3 given by the matrix\n!\n2 3\nQ3 :=\n.\n3 \u22122\n3.1. The K\u00e4hler cone. Denote with C3+ the K\u00e4hler cone of X3 . We\nhave the following\nProposition 3.1. Let X3 be a surface with N\u00e9ron-Severi lattice isomorphic to L3 . Then there is an isomorphism of lattices NS(X3 )\u2297R \u223c\n=\n2\nL3 \u2297 R \u223c\n= R such that:\n\b\n\b\nC3+ = (x, y) \u2208 R2 : 3x \u2212 2y > 0 \u2229 (x, y) \u2208 R2 : 3x + 11y > 0 .\nProof. We have first to determine the classes of the (\u22122)\u2212curves on\nX3 that is the set \u2206 \u2282 NS(X3 ) :\n\u2206 = {D \u2208 NS(X3 ) : D > 0, D 2 = \u22122, D irreducible}.\nThe condition D 2 = \u22122 means that we have to determine the integer\nsolutions of the equation\n(1)\n\nx2 + 3xy \u2212 y 2 = \u22121.\n\nWe write\u221a x2 + 3xy \u2212 y 2 = (x \u2212 \u03b1y)(x \u2212 \u1fb1y), with \u03b1 =\n\u1fb1 = \u22123\u22122 13 = \u22123 \u2212 \u03b1. Thus \u2206 corresponds to the set\n\n\u221a\n\u22123+ 13\n,\n2\n\nand\n\n{u \u2208 Z[\u03b1] : u\u016b = \u22121}.\nIt is known\nthat the invertible elements in Z[\u03b1] are Z[\u03b1]\u2217 =< \u03b7 > where\n\u221a\n\u03b7 = 3+2 13 = \u03b1 + 3 and \u03b7\u03b7\u0304 = \u22121. Thus, solutions of (1) are given by\nthe odd powers of \u03b7 and \u03b7\u0304. The element \u03b7 verifies \u03b7 3 = 11\u03b7 + \u03b7\u0304, so\n\n\fON THE AUTOMORPHISMS OF SOME K3 SURFACE DOUBLE COVER OF THE PLANE\n5\n\nby induction we obtain that \u03b7 2k+1 = a\u03b7 + b\u03b7\u0304, where a, b \u2208 Z>0 . This\nshows that to \u03b7 and \u03b7\u0304 correspond the unique two irreducible (\u22122)curves D\u03b7 , D\u03b7\u0304 in \u2206.\nThe element \u03b7 represents the solution (0, 1) of the equation (1) and \u03b7\u0304 =\n3 \u2212 \u03b7 represents (3, \u22121). Now, we can determine C + that is, following\nProp.1.2, the set\nC + = {w \u2208 C : Q3 (w, D) > 0, for all D \u2208 \u2206}.\nThis means that we are looking for the elements w = (x, y) such that\nQ3 (w, \u03b7) > 0 and Q3 (w, \u03b7\u0304) > 0, thus we obtain the statement.\n\u0003\n3.2. The automorphisms group. Denote with T3 the transcendental\nlattice of X3 . As H 2 (X3 , Z) \u223c\n= L3 \u2295T3 , we start studying the isometries\nof L3 , then we'll identify the ones preserving the ample cone and finally\nwe'll analyze the gluing conditions on T3 .\ni\n\nFirst, we note that there exists a primitive embedding L3 \u0592\u2192 U \u2295 U,\nj\n\nbut it is not unique. So one can have another embedding L3 \u0592\u2192 U \u2295 U\nsuch that i(L3 )\u22a5 \u2247 j(L3 )\u22a5 in U \u2295 U. In any case, by Theorem 1.1 one\nhas\ni(L3 )\u22a5 \u2295 U \u2295 E8 (\u22121) \u2295 E8 (\u22121) \u223c\n= j(L3 )\u22a5 \u2295 U \u2295 E8 (\u22121) \u2295 E8 (\u22121).\nMoreover, L3 is orthogonal to L3 (\u22121) in U \u2295 U. For this reason we can\nchoose T3 = L3 .\n\n\f6\n\nFEDERICA GALLUZZI AND GIUSEPPE LOMBARDO\n\nProposition 3.2. The automorphisms group Aut(L3 ) is isomorphic to\nthe group Z2 \u2217 Z2 .\nProof. The group of isometries of L3 are given by\n\b\nO(L3 ) = M \u2208 GL2 (Z) : tM Q3 M = Q3\n\nBy direct computations one obtains matrices of the following form\n\n\u00b1\nP(a,b)\n\n11b \u2213 3a\n\uf8ec\n:= \uf8ed \u22123b2\u00b1 a\n2\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\u22123b \u00b1 a\n\uf8f7\n2\n\uf8f8,\nb\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ec \u2212b\nQ\u00b1\n:=\n\uf8ed \u22123b \u00b1 a\n(a,b)\n2\n\n\uf8f6\n\u22123b \u2213 a\n\uf8f7\n2\n\uf8f8.\nb\n\nwhere the (a, b) are solutions of the generalized Pell equation\n(2)\n\na2 \u2212 13b2 = \u22124\n\nA standard result on Pell equations and on fundamental units, see\nfor example [1] and [3], says that the solutions are (\u00b1an , \u00b1bn ) with\n!2n+1\n\u221a\n\u221a\na0 + 13 b0\nan + 13bn\n, n \u2208 N and (a0 , b0 ) is the pair of\n=\n2\n2\nsmallest positive integers satisfying the equation. In our case the pair of\nsmallest positive integers\u221athat satisfy the Pell equation (2) is (a0 , b0 ) =\na0 + 13 b0\n(3, 1). Notice that\n= \u03b7 and then we can obtain solutions\n2\n(an , bn ) by recurrence multiplying by \u03b7 2 .

Set p and q for the automorphism of L3 correspond\u2212\ning to Q+\n0 and Q0 respectively. Thus we have showed that the group\nO(L3 ) can be described as hpi \u2217 hqi.\n\u0003\nTheorem 3.3. The automorphisms group of X3 is isomorphic to Z2 .\nProof. We are looking for Hodge isometries of H 2 (X3 , Z) which preserve the ample cone. From the generality of X3 we may assume that\nthe only Hodge isometries of T3 are \u00b1I. Thus, we have first to identify\nthe elements in Aut(L3 ) which preserve the K\u00e4hler cone and then we\nimpose a gluing condition on T3 , since the isometries we are looking for\nhave to induce \u00b1I on T3 . Note first that \u2212I \u2208 Aut(L3 ) can not preserve\nthe ample cone. We have from Prop.3.1 that the K\u00e4hler cone is isomorphic to the chamber delimited by HD\u03b7 \u223c\n= R+hwi\n= R+hvi and HD\u03b7\u0304 \u223c\nwhere v = (2, 3) and w = (11, \u22123).\nAn easy computation shows that the elements in Aut(L3 ) having this\nproperty are the ones generated by \u2212q which forms a Z2 . A direct\ncomputations gives that \u2212q satisfy the gluing condition on T3 .\n\u0003\n4.

Such a K3 is a double\ncover of the plane ramified over a smooth sextic tangent to a rational\ncurve of degree d. Following the same strategy adopted for the case\nd = 3, we obtain\n\n\f8\n\nFEDERICA GALLUZZI AND GIUSEPPE LOMBARDO\n\nTheorem 4.1.
