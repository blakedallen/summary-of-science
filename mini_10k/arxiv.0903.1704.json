A theoretical explanation of the multiple resonances is given using\nclassical results on theory of entire functions.

Most numerical methods are leading to the resolution\nof linear systems of simultaneous equations. When the loading conditions are taken\ninto account, the size of the matrices involved increases considerably, and they become\nfull and frequency dependent. Any method of reducing these drawbacks is therefore\nmost welcome; and one of the best methods available is that based on the perturbation\napproach. Asymptotic analysis can be conduced when the loading is light, as in the case\nof a metal structure surrounded by air. This approach consists in introducing a small\nparameter \u01eb, which is the ratio between surface mass density and fluid volume density.\nUsing perturbation expansions, one can then construct an approximate solution, based\non the in vacuo eigenmodes, which is not only easier to calculate than the exact solution\nbut also leads to a better understanding of the phenomena involved [3].\nThe light fluid loading perturbation method (involving high density structures in contact with a small density fluid) was recently extended [9] to cases where the perturbation\nparameter becomes large (which corresponds to a light and/or thin structure in contact\nwith a high density fluid). During this study multiple resonance processes were observed\nwhere a single resonance mode can have several resonance frequencies. The spectrum of\nthe operator can no longer be described in terms of the discrete spectrum based on a\ncountable series of resonance mode/resonance frequency pairs. This typically nonlinear\n1\n\nEmail address: mattei@lma.cnrs-mrs.fr\n\n063 - 1\n\n\fphenomenon is closely linked to the concept of non-linear frequency modes ([2]), where\nthe non linearity depends on the time parameters (such as those involved in porous materials) rather than on the more usual geometrical parameters. This frequency non-linearity\nis related to problems which are written in the form O(\u03c9)U = S, where u is the unknown\nfactor and S is the source term. O(\u03c9) is an operator which depends non linearly on\nthe angular frequency \u03c9, as in the case of vibroacoustics, where the coupling depends\nnon-linearly on the frequency via the Helmholtz equation Green's kernel.\nOne shows that this behavior is a general property of at least fluid-loaded simply\nsupported rectangular plates. The main results obtained in our previous study [9] are\nrecalled in paragraph 2. A theoretical description of multiple resonance in the case of a\nsimply supported plate loaded with a non vanishing density fluid is given in paragraph 3.\nIt is then established, using classical results on the connection between the order of\nan entire function and the distribution of its zeros, that any resonance mode in this\nstructure will have an infinite number of resonance frequencies. Numerical examples of\na steel plate in contact with air or water are given paragraph 4. The conclusions and\npossible extensions of this work are presented in paragraph 5.\n\n2\n\nStatement of the problem\n\nConsider a finite elastic structure occupying a domain \u03a3, the behavior of which is\ndescribed by a differential operator A (in the case treated in this communication it is\na simple bi-Laplacian operator). This structure is loaded with a perfect fluid at rest\nextending to infinity. The equation of the fluid-loaded structure is given by the classical\nintegrodifferential equation\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n2\n(1)\nAU(M, \u03c9) \u2212 \u03c1s h\u03c9 U(M, \u03c9) \u2212 \u01eb U(M , \u03c9)G(M; M , \u03c9)dM = F (M)\n\u03a3\n\nwhere \u01eb = \u03c1f /\u03c1s h is a small parameter in the case of a metal structure (volume mass density \u03c1s and thickness h) in contact with air (volume mass density \u03c1f ). G(M; M \u2032 , \u03c9) is the\nGreen's function of the Neumann problem in the Helmholtz equation outside the surface\n\u03a3. F (M) is the source. To facilitate reading, the weak formulation\nof the problem is introR R\nduced. One defines the radiation impedance \u03b2(U, V, \u03c9) = \u03a3 \u03a3 U(M \u2032 )G(M; M \u2032 , \u03c9)V \u2217 (M)dMdM \u2032 ,\nwhere U(M) and V (M) are functions defined on the surface \u03a3, a(U, V \u2217 ) stands for the potential elastic energy of the structure, hU, V \u2217 i is the usual inner product and \u03c1s h\u03c9 2 hU, V \u2217 i\nis the kinetic energy. Then the weak formulation reads: find U(M) such that for every\nV (M) one has\na(U, V \u2217 ) \u2212 \u039b\u0303m (\u03c9) (hU, V \u2217 i \u2212 \u01eb\u03b2(U, V \u2217 , \u03c9)) = hF, V \u2217 i.\n\n2.1\n\n(2)\n\nResonance modes and eigenmodes for a fluid-loaded structure\n\nThe eigenmodes \u0168m (M, \u03c9) and eigenvalues \u039b\u0303m (\u03c9) (or equivalently the eigenpulsations\n2\n\u03c9\u0303m (\u03c9) given by \u039b\u0303m (\u03c9) = \u03c1s h\u03c9\u0303m\n(\u03c9)) are the non zero solutions of the homogeneous weak\nformulation (2), that is find \u0168m (M, \u03c9) and \u03c9\u0303m (\u03c9) such that for every V (M)\n\u0010\n\u0011\n2\na(\u0168m , V \u2217 ) \u2212 \u03c1s h\u03c9\u0303m\n(\u03c9) h\u0168m , V \u2217 i \u2212 \u01eb\u03b2(\u0168m , V \u2217 , \u03c9) = 0,\n(3)\n063 - 2\n\n\f\u03b2(U, V, \u03c9), that characterizes the energy loss by radiation, depends on the frequency.\nThen the eigenmodes, well suited to deal with harmonic regime, are complex and depend\non the frequency.\nOne introduces the resonance modes, that allow to compute the transient regime in\na natural way; they are complex and do not depend on the frequency [3]. The resonance\n2\nmodes \u00dbm (M) and resonances pulsations \u03c9\u0302m , given by \u039b\u0302m = \u03c1s h\u03c9\u0302m\n, are the non zero\nsolutions of the following problem: find \u00dbm (M) and \u03c9\u0302m such that for every V (M)\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u2217\n2\n\u2217\n\u2217\na(\u00dbm , V ) \u2212 \u03c1s h\u03c9\u0302m h\u00dbm , V i \u2212 \u01eb\u03b2(\u00dbm , V , \u03c9\u0302m ) = 0.\n(4)\nThese two kind of modes, that are identical when the loading is not took into account,\nhave a strong link as each resonance pulsation is the solution of the resonance equation\n2\n2\n\u03c9\u0303m\n(\u03c9\u0302m ) = \u03c9\u0302m\n,\n\n(5)\n\nand each resonance mode is an eigenmode calculated at the corresponding resonance\npulsation.\n\u00dbm (M) = \u0168m (M, \u03c9\u0302m ).\n(6)\nIt is worth noting that in the eigenmodes are easier to compute than the resonance modes.\n\n2.2\n\nHigh order perturbation method\n\nWhen the loading parameter \u01eb is small, the eigenmodes and eigenvalues can be calculated using a perturbation method. The following perturbation expansion is introduced\ninto the weak formulation (3)\n(0)\n(1)\n(s)\n\u0168m (M) = \u0168m\n(M) + \u01eb\u0168m\n(M) + * * * + \u01ebs \u0168m\n(M) + * * *\n(0)\n(1)\ns (s)\n\u039b\u0303m = \u039b\u0303m + \u01eb\u039b\u0303m + * * * + \u01eb \u039b\u0303m + * * *\n(0)\n\n(0)\n\nwhere \u0168m (M) and \u039b\u0303m are the eigenmodes and eigenvalues\nof the elastic\nstructure in\n\u0010\n\u0011\n(0)\n(0)\u2217\nvacuo. To facilitate the reading, one poses: \u03b2 mn (\u03c9) = \u03b2 \u0168m , \u0168n , \u03c9 . It can then be\neasily established that one has\n(0) mm\nto the order 1 in \u01eb:\u039b\u0303(1)\n(\u03c9),\nm (\u03c9) = \u039b\u0303m \u03b2\n(0)\n\n(0)\nto the order 2 in \u01eb:\u039b\u0303(2)\nm (\u03c9) = \u039b\u0303m\n\n(\u03b2 mm (\u03c9))2 +\n\nX\n\n\u039b\u0303m\n\n(0)\np6=m \u039b\u0303m\n\n\u2212\n\n(0)\n\u039b\u0303p\n\n!\n\n\u03b2 mp (\u03c9) ,\n\nand so on to the higher orders. Next, as previously shown [9], by grouping the terms and\nby a re-summation technique, one shows that the high order perturbation expansion is\ngiven by\n(0)\n\u039b\u0303m\n,\n(7)\n\u039b\u0303m (\u03c9) \u2248\n1 \u2212 \u01eb\u03b2 mm (\u03c9)\nwhich remains valid even for higher values of \u01eb. It is worth noting that, compared to the\n(0)\nclassical perturbation expansion of the eigenvalues given by \u039b\u0303m (\u03c9) \u2248 \u039b\u0303m (1 + \u01eb\u03b2 mm (\u03c9)),\nthe high-order approximation (7) is particularly interesting as it gives very precise results\nfor the same numerical cost.\n063 - 3\n\n\fThe calculation of the eigenmodes and eigenvalues does not requires any particular\neffort and, for a given \u03c9, each eigenpulsation is the solution of the following eigenpulsation\nequation\n(0)2\n\u03c9\u0303m\n2\n.\n(8)\n\u03c9\u0303m (\u03c9) \u2248\n(1 \u2212 \u01eb\u03b2 mm (\u03c9))\nEquation (8) shows that the calculation of the various eigenpulsations do not requires\nany computational cost but the evaluation of multiple integrals \u03b2 mm (\u03c9).\n\n2.3\n\nThe resonance equation\n\nBy introducing in equation (5) the high order expansion of the eigenpulsation given\nby equation (8), the resonance equation (5) is approximated as\n2\n(0)2\n\u03c9\u0302m\n(1 \u2212 \u01eb\u03b2 mm (\u03c9\u0302m )) \u2248 \u03c9\u0303m\n.\n\n(9)\n\nThis shows that the calculation of the resonance pulsations is completely different\nthan that of the eigenpulsations since \u03b2 mm (\u03c9) has a rather complicated dependence on\nthe frequency and solving equation (9) requires the search for the zeros of non-convex\ncomplex function which is a challenging task. A numerical example given in the paper [9]\nhas shown a curious phenomenon of multiple resonance. That particular example has\nshowed that the resonance frequency of a particluar mode is not unique at least two\nresonance frequencies could exist simultaneously for a given geometrical configuration.\nTo have a better understanding of this non-usual phenomenon the roots of the resonance\nequation (9) are now studied in a more general manner using classical results in the\nframework of the distribution of zero of entire functions [5, 6]. In the following the\nresonance equation (9) is written as f mm (z):\n2\n,\nf mm (z) = z 2 (1 \u2212 \u01eb\u03b2 mm (z)) \u2212 z0m\n\n(10)\n\n(0)\n\nwhere z = \u03c9\u0302m and z0m = \u03c9\u0303m . The zeros of f mm (z) are the resonance pulsations.\n\n3\n3.1\n\nMultiple resonances\nMethodology\n\nNow all the problem focuses on the existence and the counting of the roots of f mm (z).\nMore or less, the theory of the zeros of entire functions (analytic functions in the whole\ncomplex plane) is based on the Great Picard's Theorem [11] which states that if f (z)\nhas an essential singularity at a point zw then on any open set containing zw , f (z) takes\non all possible values, with at most one exception, infinitely often. The exception is\nneeded as showed by the function exp(1/z) that has an essential singularity at z = 0\nbut never attains 0 as a value. The second point is that every entire function is either\na polynomial or has an essential singularity at infinity. Now if one can prove that the\nresonance function f mm (z) is an entire function, that is not a polynomial and that the\nvalue 0 is not the exception needed by the Picard's theorem, then the resonance function\nf mm (z) has an infinite number of zeros. Then for every mode, an infinite number of\nresonance exists.\n063 - 4\n\n\fNow to characterize complex function f (z) as an entire function,\nsimplest way\nPthe\nn=\u221e\nn\nis to study its development as a power series of the form f (z) =\nn=0 cn z . When\n\u221a\nlimn\u2192\u221e n cn = 0, f (z) is an entire function. To show that it is not a polynomial,\none can study its order. Let us recall that if f (z) is an entire function, the function\nM(r) = max|z|=r |f (z)| will increase indefinitely together with r. The rate of growth\nof M(r) can be characterized by comparing it with function exp(r). By definition, the\norder (of growth) \u03c1 is the smallest number such that M(r) \u2264 exp r \u03c1+\u03b7 for every \u03b7 > 0\nand for r > r0 (\u03b7). From this, it can be easily seen that the order is given by the\nformula \u03c1 = lim supr\u2192\u221e ln ln M(r)/ ln r ; as examples, a polynomial in z is of order 0,\nand the exponential function is of order 1. The order \u03c1 of an entire function depends\non the asymptotic behavior of the coefficients of its series expansion. One has 1/\u03c1 =\nlimn\u2192\u221e inf(ln(1/|cn |)/(n ln n)) ([11]); or in other words, if cn \u221d 1/(n!)\u03b1 then \u03c1 = 1/\u03b1.\nOne can simplify again the problem under consideration. The resonance function can\n2\n2\nbe written as f mm (z) = z 2 \u2212 z0m\n\u2212 \u01ebz 2 \u03b2 mm (z), as a sum of a polynomial (z 2 \u2212 z0m\n) of\norder 0 and a function which is the product of a polynomial (\u01ebz 2 ) also of order 0 and\nthe radiation impedance \u03b2 mm (z) which order is to be determined. The distribution of\nzeros of f mm (z) can be deduced from that of \u03b2 mm (z) as long as \u01eb has a non zero value. If\n\u03b2 mm (z) is a polynomial, the resonance function is also a polynomial with a finite number\nof roots. If \u03b2 mm (z) is an entire function (in the case considered below it is of order 1)\nwith essential singularity at infinity, then f mm (z) is also an entire function with essential\nsingularity at infinity and by the Picard's theorem f mm (z) can takes on all possible values\nat infinity, with at most one exception, infinitely often.\nThe main results of this paper is, as shown below on the particular example of a\nsimply supported plate, that the radiation impedance and the resonance function are\nentire functions of exponential type (that is of order one and normal type [5]) that both\nhave an infinite number of roots.\n\n3.2\n\nThe resonance function of a simply supported baffled plate\nas an entire function of the frequency\n\nNow let us consider a thin simply supported rectangular plate (dimensions a \u00d7 b\nwith thickness h) made of isotropic material with Young's modulus E, Poisson's co(0)\nefficient\n\u03bd and density \u03c1s . In a vacuum, the eigenmodes are\ngiven by \u0168mn (x, y) =\n\u221a\np\n(0)\n2/ ab sin m\u03c0x/a sin n\u03c0y/b and the eigenpulsations by \u03c9mn = \u03c0 2 D/(\u03c1s h) [(m/a)2 + (n/b)2 ]\n(0)\n(0)\u2217\nwith D = Eh3 /12(1\u2212\u03bd 2 ). When the plate is baffled, the radiation impedance \u03b2(\u0168mn , \u0168mn , \u03c9)\nis given as\nZ Z Z Z\n\u0131 \u03c9c d\nab 1 1 1 1\n\u2032\n\u2032e\n(0)\n(0)\u2217\ndxdydx\u2032 dy \u2032,\nsin m\u03c0x sin n\u03c0y sin m\u03c0x sin n\u03c0y\n\u03b2(\u0168mn , \u0168mn , \u03c9) = \u2212\n\u03c0 0 0 0 0\nd\n(11)\np\n2\n\u2032\n2\n2\n\u2032\n2\nwhere d = a (x \u2212 x ) + b (y \u2212 y ) and c is the speed of waves in the fluid. In the\nfollowing, the pulsation dependence in \u03c9 is changed into the equivalent wavenumber\ndependence in k = \u03c9/c. Since the in vacuo modes involve a double index, the notation\n(0)\n(0)\u2217\nfor the radiation impedance is simplified as \u03b2(\u0168mn , \u0168mn , \u03c9) = \u03b2 mn (k). The resonance\n(0)\n2\nfunction is denoted by f mn (k) = k 2 (1 \u2212 \u01eb\u03b2 mn (k)) \u2212 k0mn\n, with k0mn = \u03c9mn /c.\n063 - 5\n\n\fIt is worth noting that \u03b2 mn (k) and f mn (k) decrease in the upper complex plane (with\nI(k) > 0, the term exp(\u0131kd) has an exponential decrease when |k| \u2192 \u221e) and conversely\ngrow in the lower complex plane, then all the roots of these two functions are located in\nthe lower complex half plane. As the time dependency had been chosen as exp(\u2212\u0131\u03c9t),\nthis ensures that the movement of the plate remains finite over time [3].\nBy making a change of variable [7], it can be easily shown that \u03b2 mn (k) is given by\nZ Z\ne\u0131kD\n4ab 1 1\nmn\nGm (X)Gn (Y )\ndXdY,\n(12)\n\u03b2 (k) = \u2212\n\u03c0 0 0\nD\n\u221a\nwhere D = a2 X 2 + b2 Y 2 .

Its order is easy to obtain from classical results on the sum and\nproduct of entire functions (see for example [11], chapter VII paragraph 6). There is\ntwo possibilities for characterizing the growth of M\u03b2 mn (r) for r sufficiently large: the\nfirst is that if \u03c3 denotes a finite positive number and C a positive constant one has\nM\u03b2 mn (r) \u2248 C exp(\u03c3r) which implies that the radiation impedance is of order 1, the\nsecond is that M\u03b2 mn (r) = 0 which implies that the radiation impedance is of order 0.\nFrom the expressions of the functions h13mn (\u03b8) and h23mn (\u03b8) given in the appendix, it is\nobvious that for a 6= b and for m 6= n one cannot have h13mn (\u03b81 )e\u0131kc1 = \u2212h23mn (\u03b82 )e\u0131kc2 .

Such functions are known as entire function of exponential type (EFET) [6]. The\nresonance function and the radiation impedance are EFET. They both possess an additional property on the distribution of their zeros. They are functions that belong to the\nCartwright class C [6].

This\nresult is a very strong one, since not only it ensures that the resonance function possesses\nan infinite number of zeros but also that \"almost all\" zeros lie in the neighborhood of the\nreal axis.\nIt is worth noting that the zeros are counted with their multiplicity order. Then the\nzeros of the resonance function appears as conjugate pairs and then must be counted\n2\ntwice. Actually, the resonance function f mn (k) = k 2 (1 \u2212 \u01eb\u03b2 mn (k)) + k0mn\ncan be apmn\n2\n1\n4 \u0131kc1\n2\nproached for |k| \u2192 \u221e by f (k) = k (1 \u2212 \u01eb2h3mm (\u03b81 )/k e\n+ k0mn , then if k\u0302 is a\nsolution of f mn (k\u0302) = 0, it is easy to see that \u2212k\u0302 \u22c6 , the opposite of its conjugate satisfies\nf mn (\u2212k\u0302 \u22c6 ) = 0.\n\n4\n\nNumerical examples\n\nIn this section, some numerical examples of the multiple resonance phenomenon are\npresented. As it is impossible to obtain a closed formula for J1mn (k, \u03b8) and J2mn (k, \u03b8)\ngiven by equations (14), a numerically efficient approximation of these functions has been\nconstructed. As shown below, this approximation preserves the order properties of the\ninvolved functions. Since one always has 0 < \u03b8\u03b1 < \u03c0/2, the functions to be integrated\nare expanded with respect to the angular variable \u03b8 to the order 1. This gives\n\u0131a3 k 3 + 2m2 \u03c0 2 \u2212 \u0131akm2 \u03c0 2 \u2212 (\u22121)m 2e\u0131ak m2 \u03c0 2\n,\n4(ak \u2212 m\u03c0)2 (ak + m\u03c0)2\n\u0131b3 k 3 + 2n2 \u03c0 2 \u2212 \u0131bkn2 \u03c0 2 \u2212 (\u22121)n 2e\u0131bk n2 \u03c0 2\nJ2mn (k, \u03b8) \u2248 j2n (k) = b\n.\n4(bk \u2212 n\u03c0)2 (nk + n\u03c0)2\n\nJ1mn (k, \u03b8) \u2248 j1m (k) = a\n\n063 - 9\n\n(32)\n(33)\n\n\fAfter reporting the two expansions (32) and (32) in the radiation impedance given in\nequation (13), the following approximation of \u03b2 mn (k), denoted by \u03b2\u030c mn (k), is obtained\n4\n\u03b2\u030c mn (k) = \u2212 (j1m (k)\u03b8\u03b1 + j2n (k)(\u03c0/2 \u2212 \u03b8\u03b1 )).\n\u03c0\n\n(34)\n\nIt is worth noting that the accuracy of the approximation of \u03b2 mn (k) decreases as the\nmode order increases. However, at low orders (say m \u2264 3, n \u2264 3) it remains sufficient.\nIt is easy to obtain\n\u00b13\u0131 + m\u03c0\n1 \u2212 (\u22121)m\n, and j1m (k = 0) = a\n,\n16m\u03c0\n2m2 \u03c0 2\n1 \u2212 (\u22121)n\n\u00b13\u0131 + n\u03c0\n, and j2n (k = 0) = b\n.\nj2n (k = \u00b1n\u03c0/b) = b\n16n\u03c0\n2n2 \u03c0 2\n\nj1m (k = \u00b1m\u03c0/a) = a\n\n(35)\n(36)\n\nThen as j1m (k) and j2n (k) are entire functions of k, \u03b2\u030c mn (k) is also an entire function of\nk. It still remains to estimate the order of \u03b2\u030c mn (k). For given m and n and for |k| \u2192 \u221e,\none has\nlim j1m (k) =\n\n|k|\u2192\u221e\n\n\u2212(\u22121)m m2 \u03c0 2 e\u0131ak\n\u2212(\u22121)n n2 \u03c0 2 e\u0131bk\nand\nlim\nj\n(k)\n=\n,\n2n\n|k|\u2192\u221e\n2a3 k 4\n2b3 k 4\n\nthen\nlim \u03b2\u030c\n\n|k|\u2192\u221e\n\nmn\n\n(k) = 2\u03c0\n\n\u0012\n\nm2\n(\u22121)m 3 \u03b8\u03b1 e\u0131ak\na\n\n+\n\nn2\n(\u22121)n 3\nb\n\n\u0010\u03c0\n2\n\n\u0011\n\n\u0131bk\n\n\u2212 \u03b8\u03b1 e\n\n\u0013\n\n1\n.\nk4\n\n(37)\n\nIt is worth noting that the approximation of the radiation impedance given in equation\n(34) or in equation (37) presents a similar comportment than the exact one: a sum\nof exponential functions divided by a polynomial of the fourth degree; also the lower\nthe mode order, the better the approximation \u03b2\u030c mn (k) becomes. To confirm that the\napproximation keeps the order of \u03b2\u030c mn (k) to one, classical results on the sum and product\nof entire functions are used again. First it is worth noting that the entire function\n(\u22121)m m2 /a3 \u03b8\u03b1 e\u0131ak + (\u22121)n n2 /b3 (\u03c0/2 \u2212 \u03b8\u03b1 ) e\u0131bk cannot be identically zero for any value\nof a, b, m or n when |k| \u2192 \u221e. To see this more clearly, one can deal separately with the\ncases a = b and a6= b.\n2\n\n\u03c0\nm 2\nn 2\n\u0131ak 1\nThe case a = b. One has \u03b8\u03b1 = \u03c0/4 and \u03b2\u030c mn (k) \u2248 2a\n3 ((\u22121) m + (\u22121) n ) e\nk4\nbecomes the product of the exponential function e\u0131ak of order 1 and the inverse of a\ndegree 4 polynomial in k, which is of order 0. \u03b2\u030c mn (k) is therefore an entire function of\norder 1 and of type a.\n\nThe case a 6= b. Let us take for example a > b. Then with |k| \u2192 \u221e one has\nmax e\u0131ak \u226b max e\u0131bk ; it is worth noting that this is true in the half plane I(k) < 0,\nwhereas in the half plane I(k) > 0, \u03b2\u030c mn (k) tend rapidly\n\u0001 to zero. In the half plane\nm 2\n\u0131ak 1\nwhich is also the product\n(\u22121)\nm\n\u03b8\ne\nI(k) < 0, one therefore has \u03b2\u030c mn (k) \u2248 2\u03c0\n\u03b1\na3\nk4\n\u0131ak\nof the exponential function e of order 1 and the inverse of a degree 4 polynomial in\nk, which is of order 0. \u03b2\u030c mn (k) is therefore an entire function of order 1 and of type\na. It is worth noting that if b > a its type is b. In other words, one can assume that\n\u03c3 = max(a, b).\n063 - 10\n\n\f2\nFigure 1: Contour plots of |k 2 (1 \u2212 \u01eb\u03b2\u030c mn (k)) \u2212 k0mn\n| in the mode m = 2, n = 3. Steel\nplate in contact with air \u01eb \u2248 0.002 (left) and water \u01eb \u2248 1.5 (right).\n\nBoth radiation impedance \u03b2\u030c mn (k) and resonance relation f\u02c7mn (k) belong to the Cartwright\nclass C and then all, but a finite number of, their zeros must lie in the neighborhood of\nthe real axis.\nAs shown above the type \u03c3 of \u03b2\u030c mn (k) is given by \u03c3 = max(a, b). Then the type\n2\nof f\u02c7mn (k) is given the type of k 2 (1 \u2212 \u01eb\u03b2 mn (k)) + k0mn\n; and for \u01eb 6= 0 it is given by\n\u03c3 = max(a, b). By the Cartwright and Levinson theorem, the density of resonances\nlimr\u2192\u221e (n+ (r, \u03b1)/r + n\u2212 (r, \u03b1)/r) is then given by 2 max(a, b)/\u03c0. To verify this, the simplest way is to count the zeros of f mn (z) using the argument theorem on the disk C\nwith radius K centered on the origin. It is clear from equations (35) and (36) that\n\u03b2\u030c mn (k) and f\u02c7mn (k) have no pole inside C. The number of its zeros inside this disk,\nin the case of the mode (m \u2212 n), is denoted by nf\u02c7mn (K). It is given by the integral\nH\nnf\u02c7mn (K) = 1/(2\u0131\u03c0) C f\u02c7\u2032mn (k)/f\u02c7mn (k)dk with k = Ke\u0131\u03b8 . This integral is computed\nnumerically without difficulty. As shown before, the zeros occur in combined pairs of\nnegative imaginary part, then each zero must be counted twice; then the density of\nthe zeros given by (n(K, \u03b1)/K = n+ (K, \u03b1)/K + n\u2212 (K, \u03b1)/K has the asymptotic value\nlimK\u2192\u221e n(K, \u03b1)/K = 2nf\u02c7mn (K)/K.\nFor example, let us take a steel (E = 200 Gpa, \u03bd = 0.3 and \u03c1s = 7800 Kg/m3 ) simply\nsupported rectangular plate in contact with air (with density \u03c1f = 1.2 Kg/m3 and sound\nwave celerity c = 340 m/s) and let the plate dimensions be a = 1 m, b = 0.7 m and\nh = 8.2 cm. It can easily be established that in the mode m = 1, n = 1, one has\nnf\u02c711 (12) = 2, nf\u02c711 (18) = 4 and nf\u02c711 (30) = 8. In the mode m = 2, n = 3, one has\nnf\u02c723 (19) = 1, nf\u02c723 (20) = 3, nf\u02c723 (30) = 7. As the radius K of the disk C becomes large\none obtains for the density nf\u02c7mn (K)/K, with e.g. K = 5000\nnf\u02c711 (K)\nnf\u02c712 (K)\nnf\u02c723 (K)\nnf\u02c722 (K)\n1\n1\n1\n1\n=\n,\n=\n,\n=\n,\n=\nK\n3.1407\nK\n3.1407\nK\n3.14268\nK\n3.14268\nThis confirms that limK\u2192\u221e n(K, \u03b1)/K = 2nf\u02c7mn (K)/K = 2 max(a, b)/\u03c0. Similar results\nare obtained if for the fluid water is chosen instead of air or for various plate dimensions.\n063 - 11\n\n\f2\nFigure 2: Contour plots of |k 2 (1\u2212\u01eb\u03b2\u030c mn (k))\u2212k0mn\n| in the mode m = 2, n = 3. Aluminium\nplate in contact with air \u01eb \u2248 0.005 (left) and water \u01eb \u2248 4.5 (right).\n\nAll these numeric values are a validation of the theoretical results obtained in the paragraph 3. The resonance relation of the fluid loaded plate has an infinite number of zeros.\nTherefore, while in a vacuum, each mode of a simply supported plate will have only one\nresonance frequency (and its opposite), under loading condition each mode will have an\ninfinite number of resonance frequencies. This result is confirmed in figures 1 and 2. In\nthese various contour plots, the dark spots that appear correspond to the resonances of\nthe simply supported plate, that is the roots of f\u02c7mn (k) = 0. In figures 1, the material of\nthe plate is steel with E = 200 Gpa, \u03bd = 0.3 and \u03c1s = 7800 Kg/m3 . In figure 2 the plate\nis made of aluminium E = 70 Gpa, \u03bd = 0.3 and \u03c1s = 2700 Kg/m3 . The dimensions of\nthe two plates under consideration are the same and are given by 1 m \u00d7 0.7 m \u00d7 8.2 cm.\nWhile the spectra of both plates are similar in air (excepted in a higher imaginary part\nof all resonances of the aluminium plate) since they both have more or less same ratio\nE/\u03c1s and more or less the same spectrum in vacuo, when loaded by water the difference\nbetween the two spectra is obvious. It is worth noting that the multiple resonance phenomenon makes classical modal analysis rather difficult. This could be seen in figure 2\nwhere it is easy to se that there is two resonances very close together (around R(k) \u2248 18\nand I(k) \u2248 \u22123). While in air (or in water for the steel plate) choosing the resonance close\nto the real axis and neglect the resonances with high imaginary part (corresponding to\nrapidly vanishing waves) is natural, in water there is, in the present case, two resonances\n(and then two resonance modes) that have equal importance.\nNow let us return to the initial question of the existence or non-existence of multiple\nresonances in fluid-loaded plates. In every boundary condition, one has to look for the\n(0)2\n2\n(\u03c9)) \u2212 \u03c9\u0303mn = 0. Although it has\nresonance pulsations \u03c9\u0302mn such that \u03c9\u0302mn\n(1 \u2212 \u01eb\u03b2\u03c9\u0302mn\nmn\nnot been proved that such a comportment is true under various boundary conditions, it\nseems reasonable to assume that under boundary conditions of all kinds every resonance\nmode in a plate has an infinite number of resonance frequencies as \u01eb 6= 0 (the radiation\nimpedance given by relation (12) seems to be an EFET for a large variety of functions\nGm and Gn ).\n063 - 12\n\n\f5\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nThe loading of a rectangular plate with a high density fluid transforms each resonance\ninto an infinite number of resonances. These results open up new prospects. In particular, it would be interesting to obtain similar estimates on the vibratory modes occurring\nin clamped plates or mechanical structures of other kinds, although these may not be\neasy to obtain. Another question which arises is how to determine under what conditions moderately coupled systems (such as a steel plate in contact with water) will have\nthese properties. Another important aspect worth investigating is the validity of modal\nexpansions in the case of resonance modes having two or more resonances frequencies. It\nwould also be interesting to develop experimental device which would make it possible\nto test the occurrence of the behavior described here.\nAcknowledgments: this work was partially supported by the Agence Nationale de la\nRecherche (ANR) thru grant ANR-06-BLAN-0081-01.\n\nReferences\n[1] C.M.
