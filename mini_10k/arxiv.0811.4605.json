Various efforts on these issues have been undertaken in these few years, see e.g., [1, 2, 3, 4] for the\nsystem parameter uncertainty. Among such limitations,\ntime delays in the feedback loop, which happen due to the\nfinite computational speed of classical controller devices,\nare extremely serious, since their effect may completely\nlose the benefit of feedback control [5, 6, 7]. To avoid the\ntime delays, one can think to use the Markovian feedback\ncontrol, in which the measurement results are directly fed\nback [8, 9]. However, while these experimental simplification has been extensively studied, theoretical ways to\nevaluate the effect of the time delays have not been proposed so far.\nIn this paper, we investigate the effect of the time delays on the control performance, which is defined in terms\nof the cost function optimized by feedback control. This\ninvestigation provides theoretical guidelines for the feedback control experiment. As the controlled object, the\nlinear quantum systems are considered. In order to prepare the tool for the analysis, we first consider the optimal LQG control problem subject to the constant time\ndelay. The optimal controller is obtained via the existing\nresults in the classical control theory [10]. Further, these\nresults allow us to obtain the formula for the optimal\nvalue of the cost.\nThe obtained formula enables us to examine the relation between the optimal control performance and the\ntime delay both in an analytical and a numerical ways.\nThen, the intrinsic stability of the systems is dominant\nfor the performance degradation effect. If the system is\nstable, the degradation effect converges to some value in\nthe large time delay limit. Otherwise, the performance\nmonotonically deteriorates as the delay length becomes\nlarger. Based on this fact, we perform the analysis stated\nabove for several physical systems that possess different\nstability properties. In addition to the controller design,\nwe examine the relationship between the measurement\n\napparatus and the best achievable performance. Based\non this, we propose a detector parameter tuning policy\nfor feedback control of the time-delayed systems.\nThis paper is organized as follows. Linear quantum\ncontrol systems are introduced in the next section. In\nSection III, we state the control problem for dealing with\nthe time delay issue, and provide its optimal solution.\nIn Section IV, we investigate the effect of the time delay\nin quantum feedback control based on two typical examples possessing different stability properties. Section V\nconcludes the paper.\nWe use the following notation. For a matrix A = (aij ),\nAT , A\u2020 and A\u2217 are defined by AT = (aji ), A\u2020 = (a\u2217ji )\nand A\u2217 = (a\u2217ij ), respectively, where the matrix element\naij may be an operator and a\u2217ij denotes its adjoint. The\nsymbols Re(A) and Im(A) denote the real and imaginary\nparts of A, respectively, i.e., Re(A) = (A + A\u2217 )/2 and\nIm(A) = (A \u2212 A\u2217 )/2i. All the rules above are applied to\nany rectangular matrix.\nII.\n\nLINEAR QUANTUM SYSTEM\n\nConsider a quantum system which interacts with a vacuum electromagnetic field through the system operator\nc = Cx,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere x = [q, p]T and C = [c1 , c2 ] \u2208 C1\u00d72 . When the\nsystem Hamiltonian is denoted by H, this interaction is\ndescribed by a unitary operator Ut obeying the following quantum stochastic differential equation called the\nHudson-Parthasarathy equation [11] :\n\u0014\u0012\n\u0015\n\u0013\n1\ndUt =\n\u2212iH \u2212 c\u2020 c dt + cdBt\u2020 \u2212 c\u2020 dBt Ut , (2)\n2\nwhere U0 is the identity operator. The field operators\nBt\u2020 and Bt are the creation and annihilation operator\nprocesses, which satisfy the following quantum It\u00f4 rule:\ndBt dBt\u2020 = dt, dBt dBt = dBt\u2020 dBt = dBt\u2020 dBt\u2020 = 0.\n\n(3)\n\nFurther, suppose that the system is trapped in a harmonic potential, and that a linear potential is an input\n\n\f2\nto the system. The system Hamiltonian Ht at time t is\ngiven by\nHt =\n\n1 T\nx Gx \u2212 xT \u03a3But\n2\n\n(4)\n\nwhere ut \u2208 R is the control input at time t, the system parameters G \u2208 R2\u00d72 and B \u2208 R2 are a symmetric\nmatrix and a column vector, and \u03a3 is given by\n\u0015\n\u0014\n0 1\n.\n\u03a3=\n\u22121 0\nT\n\n[Ut qUt\u2020 , Ut pUt\u2020 ]T\n\nThen, by defining xt = [qt , pt ] =\nand\nby using the commutation relation [q, p] = i and the\nquantum It\u00f4 formula, we obtain the following linear equation:\ndxt = Axt dt + But dt + i\u03a3(C T dBt\u2020 \u2212 C \u2020 dBt ),\n\n(5)\n\nwhere A := \u03a3[G + Im(C \u2020 C)]. Measurement processes\nare described as follows. Suppose that the field observable e\u2212i\u03c6 Bt +ei\u03c6 Bt\u2020 is measured by the perfect homodyne\ndetector, where \u03c6 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0) denotes the detector parameter that the experimenter can change [12]. Then, the\noutput signal yt is obtained by\nyt = Ut\u2020 (e\u2212i\u03c6 Bt + ei\u03c6 Bt\u2020 )Ut .\n\n(6)\n\nThe simple calculation yields the infinitesimal increment\nof the observable yt as follows:\ndyt = (e\u2212i\u03c6 C + ei\u03c6 C \u2217 )xt dt + e\u2212i\u03c6 dBt + ei\u03c6 dBt\u2020 .\n\n(7)\n\nIn the following section, we refer to (5) and (7) as the\nsystem dynamics and the output equation, respectively.\nIII.\n\nOPTIMAL FEEDBACK CONTROL\nA.\n\nInput-output delay system\n\nAs stated in the introduction, the effect of time delays\nis significant in feedback control of quantum systems.\nThose delays are mainly originated from the computational time for a controller and the transition delay of\nsignals. Thus, they should be modelled practically as\ninput-output delays in the feedback loop, i.e., at time t,\nthe signal ut\u2212h1 works as a control input for the system\nand the information {ys }s\u2264t\u2212h2 is available in the controller, where we assume that h1 and h2 are constants.\nWithout loss of generality, when we consider the optimal control problem for such a system, the total delay\ntime can be simply put together into one input (or output) delay. Then, the system dynamics are modified as\nfollows:\ndxt = Axt dt + But\u2212h dt + i\u03a3(C T dBt\u2020 \u2212 C \u2020 dBt ).\n\n(8)\n\nHere, the real constant h denotes the total time delay in\nthe feedback loop, i.e., h = h1 + h2 . Note here that ut\nshould be determined by {ys }s\u2264t .\n\nB.\n\nOptimal control performance\n\nWe consider the optimal control problem for the system described by (7) and (8). The following system expression is convenient for exploiting results in the classical control theory. Let us define a quantum noise vector\n\u0014 \u2212i\u03c6\n\u0015\ne Bt + ei\u03c6 Bt\u2020\nwt :=\n.\n(9)\n\u2212iBt + iBt\u2020\nIt is shown that the quantum noise vector satisfies the\nfollowing properties:\nhwt i = 0,\ndwt dwsT =\n\n(10)\n\u001a\n\nF\u03c6 dt, if s = t\n0, otherwise\n\n(11)\n\nwhere h*i denotes the expectation and F is the nonnegative Hermitian matrix given by\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1\nie\u2212i\u03c6\nF\u03c6 :=\n.\n\u2212iei\u03c6\n1\nAlso, we define the matrix S\u03c6 := 12 (F\u03c6 + F\u03c6T ). By substituting the terms of the field observables Bt , Bt\u2020 with the\nnoise vector wt , we obtain the following equations:\ndxt = Axt dt + B1 dwt + B2 ut\u2212h dt,\nzt = C1 xt + D12 ut\u2212h ,\ndyt = C2 xt dt + D21 dwt .\n\n(12)\n\nHere, zt is an additional output signal defined to evaluate\nthe system performance, and C1 \u2208 R2\u00d72 and D12 \u2208 R2\nare matrices freely tunable in controller design. The\nother system matrices are defined as follows:\n\u0012 \u0014\n\u0015\u0013\n2 exp(\u2212i\u03c6)\n2i\n\u2020\nB1 := \u03a3 Im C\n,\n1 + exp(\u2212i2\u03c6) 1 + exp(\u2212i2\u03c6)\nB2 := B,\nC2 := e\u2212i\u03c6 C + ei\u03c6 C \u2217 ,\n\u0002\n\u0003\nD21 := 1 0 .\n\nAs depicted in Fig. 1, we investigate the feedback loop\nconsisting of the system and a controller implemented\nby classical devices, such as analogue or digital circuits.\nThen, the optimal control problem is stated as follows.\nProblem 1 For the linear quantum system (12), find\nthe causal, linear and time-invariant control law u :\n{ys }s\u2264t \u2192 ut that minimizes the cost functional\nJ := lim hztT zt i,\nt\u2192\u221e\n\n(13)\n\nand determine the minimum value of J.\nWe make the following assumption, which is standard in\nthe classical control theory; see [13] for the details.\nAssumption 1\n\n\f3\nzt\nPlant (12)\n(Quantum)\nyt\nDelay h1\n\nDelay h2\n\nController\n(Classical)\n\nut\n\nFIG. 1: Control of quantum systems by classical controllers\n\n1.

For the\nspecific form of the optimal controller, see the appendix.\nTheorem 1 Consider Problem 1 with Assumption 1.\nLet X, Y be the solutions of the matrix Riccati equations XA + AT X + C1T C1 \u2212 F T E1 F = 0 and Y AT + AY +\nT\nC1 )\nB1 S\u03c6 B1T \u2212LE2,\u03c6 LT = 0 with F := \u2212E1\u22121 (B2T X +D12\n\u22121\nT\nT\nand L := \u2212(Y C2 + B1 S\u03c6 D21 )E2,\u03c6 such that A + B2 F ,\nA + LC2 are stable. Then, the optimal value of the cost\nfunctional J is given by\nopt\nJh,\u03c6\n\n:=\n\nJ\u03c6opt\n\n+\n\nZ\n\nh\n\n(F eA\u03c4 L)2 d\u03c4,\n\n(14)\n\n0\n\nwhere J\u03c6opt := tr(B1 S\u03c6 B1T X) + tr(F T E1 F Y ) is the optimal value of J when h = 0.\nNote that the existence of the Riccati solutions X and Y\nfollows from Assumption 1.\n\nIV.\n\nEFFECT OF FEEDBACK DELAY\n\nIn the experiment of the feedback control, it is of importance to reduce the time delay by carefully setting\nup the experimental devices and achieve the best performance possible [6, 7]. However, some quantity of the\n\ntime delay remains in practice. In this section, we investigate how the time delay deteriorates the optimal control performance by using the formula (14). In addition\nto the algorithm in the controller, we have the tunable\nparameter in the measurement apparatus. Thus, we do\nthe analysis taking the detector parameter tuning into\nconsideration. It should be noted that the optimal measurement technique was first introduced by Wiseman and\nDoherty [14]. Their technique is only for the delay-free\nsystems, i.e., the optimization of the value of J\u03c6opt .\nFirst of all, notice that the performance degradation\neffect is mainly determined by the exponential term in\n(14). This means that the degradation is largely related\nto the system's intrinsic stability, i.e., the eigenvalues of\nthe matrix A. Thus, it is obvious from the exponential\nopt\ngrowth of Jh,\u03c6\nthat the unstable system easily deteriorates as the time delay length increases, and that their\ncontrol is significantly difficult.\nOn the other hand, the remaining two classes, i.e., stable and marginally stable systems, are relatively insensitive to the time delay and it is worth to analyze them\nin detail. In order to provide some guidelines for the\nexperiments, we analyze the two physical systems that\nfrequently appear in the context of quantum feedback\ncontrol. In the following, we choose the matrices C1 and\nD12 as\n\u0015\n\u0014 \u0015\n\u0014\n1\n1 0\n.\n, D12 =\nC1 =\n1\n0 1\nStable system - Consider a damped cavity with an\non-threshold parametric down converter. The system\nHamiltonian and the coupling operator are given by\nHt =\n\n\u03b3\n(qp + pq) \u2212 ut\u2212h q, c = \u03b4(q + ip),\n2\n\n(15)\n\nwhere \u03b3 > 0 and \u03b4 > 0 are constant parameters. If they\nsatisfy \u03b3 < \u03b4 2 , the system is stable. In this case, clearly,\nopt\nJh,\u03c6\nconverges as h \u2192 \u221e since the real part of every\neigenvalue of A is negative. When we choose the parameter as \u03b3 = 1/2 and \u03b4 = 1, the optimal performance\ncurves with the different detector parameters \u03c6 are given\nby Fig. 2. It is certainly confirmed that the performance\ndegradation converges in the limit of h \u2192 \u221e for any detector parameters. The dashed line depicts the value of\nJ when there is no control input field, i.e., ut \u2261 0 for\nany t \u2265 0. We can see from the figure that even in the\nlarge delay limit, the appropriate measurement strategy\nsignificantly enhances the control performance compared\nto the uncontrolled case.\nIn order to examine the effective detector parameter\ntuning, let us look at Figs. 2 and 3. These show that the\noptimal detector parameter hardly fluctuates over every\ndelay length. In fact, we can see from Fig. 2 that the\ndifference between two performance curves around the\noptimal one, i.e., the curve corresponding to \u03c6 = 1.98, is\nvery small. Further, it is shown that the optimal measurement strategy in the delay-free case is perfectly the\nsame as that in the large delay case.\n\n\f4\nTheorem 2 Consider Problem 1 with Ht and c defined\nby (15).

This is a natural result of the fact that the\nmatrix A has only pure imaginary eigenvalues. On the\nother hand, the second statement gives us a nontrivial\ninsight: the growth rate A and the oscillation amplitude\nB are independent of the detector parameter \u03c6.\n\nHence, depending on the delay length, the importance\nof the choice of the measurement apparatus differs. If\nthe delay length is small, the improvable performance\nlevel is sensitive to the value of h. On the other hand,\nif the system suffers from the large delay, the apparatus\nadjustment is not significant, since the improvable performance level is relatively small compared to the value\nopt\nof Jh,\u03c6\n. Thus, if the time delay can be made sufficiently\nsmall, experimenters have to adjust the detector parameter depending on the resulting delay length.

The analysis was performed by\nthe optimal control performance formula from the classical control theory.
