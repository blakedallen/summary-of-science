(see for example\n[1]).\nIn this work we shall derive an expression for the effective inertial mass\ndensity of a dissipative relativistic fluid, which is valid just after the fluid\nleaves the equilibrium, on a time scale of the order of relaxation time.\nBy \"effective inertial mass\" (e.i.m.) density we mean the factor of proportionality between the applied three-force density and the resulting proper\nacceleration (i.e., the three-acceleration measured in the i.r.f.).\nAs we shall see, the obtained expression for the e.i.m. density contains a\ncontribution from dissipative variables which reduces its value with respect to\nthe non-dissipative situation. Such decreasing of e.i.m. density has already\nbeen brought out in the spherically symmetric self-gravitating case [2], the\naxially symmetric self-gravitating case [3] and also for slowly rotating selfgravitating systems [4]. Here we want to provide a general derivation for the\ne.i.m. density of a dissipative fluid, which is independent on the symmetry\nof the problem.On the other hand, in order to derive the expression for the\ne.i.m. density, it will be necessary to suppress gravitational contributions to\nfour acceleration. This will be achieved by evaluating the equation of motion\nin a locally Minkowski frame, where local gravitational effects vanish. Then\nevaluating the resulting equation of motion in the i.r.f. we are led to an\nexpression which takes the desired, \"Newtonian\", form.\nForce=e.i.m. \u00d7 acceleration(proper),\nIt is perhaps worth noticing that the concept of effective inertial mass is\nfamiliar in other branches of physics, thus for example the e.i.m. of an\nelectron moving under a given force through a crystal, differs from the value\ncorresponding to an electron moving under the same force in free space, and\nmay even become negative (see [5, 6]).\nIn order to illustrate our point and to establish the notation, we shall\nfirst consider, very briefly, the perfect fluid case. However before closing this\n2\n\n\fSection, the following comments are in order:\nIt is worth noticing, that there is not a unique way to define the four\nvelocity of a dissipative fluid. Indeed, we may take, among other possibilities,\nthe four velocity vector as being related to the velocity of energy transport\n(Landau-Lifshitz [7]) or to the velocity of particles (fluid element) as done by\nEckart ([8]), both choices are of course perfectly equivalent, and both lead to\ndifferent definitions of rest frame. In the former case there is not energy flux\nin the rest frame (the T 0j components of the energy tensor vanish), whereas\nin the later the spatial components of the particle current four vector vanish\nin the comoving frame. In this work we adopt the Eckart choice.\nThis is motivated by the fact that the very concept of e.i.m. as defined\nabove, requires (and makes sense only for) such choice (Eckart). Indeed,\nobserve that the concept of e.i.m. requires the existence of a frame where\nthe three-force applied to a particle and the resulting three acceleration are\nparallel, and this only happens in the i.r.f. where a given fluid element is at\nrest. But this is the Eckart frame by definition.\nIn the Landau-Lifshitz frame we cannot say that such relation between the\napplied three-force and the resulting three accelerations follows, and therefore\nin such case the very meaning of e.i.m. is uncertain.\n\n2\n\nThe e.i.m. density of a relativistic perfect\nfluid\n\nLet us consider a relativistic perfect fluid, whose energy-momentum tensor\ntakes the usual form\nT \u03bc\u03bd = (\u03c1 + p)u\u03bc u\u03bd \u2212 pg \u03bc\u03bd\n(1)\n(we use relativistic units and signature \u22122)\nThen the equation of motion yields\n(\u03c1 + p)a\u03b1 = h\u03b1\u03bd p,\u03bd\n\n(2)\n\nh\u03b1\u03bc \u2261 \u03b4\u03bc\u03b1 \u2212 u\u03b1 u\u03bc\n\n(3)\n\nwith\nu\u0307\u03bc \u2261 a\u03bc = u\u03bd u\u03bc;\u03bd\n3\n\n(4)\n\n\fwhere colon and semicolon denote partial and covariant derivatives, respectively.\nObserve that for the sake of generality we are including gravitational field,\nalthough, as already noticed, the final expression for e.i.m. density will be\nindependent of gravity.\nEq.(2) suggests that (\u03c1+ p) plays the role of the e.i.m. density of the fluid\n(which is in fact the case). However, we recall that the applied three-force\nand the resulting three-acceleration are paralell only in the i.r.f., therefore,\nin order to conclude that (\u03c1 + p) represents the e.i.m. density, (2) has to\nbe evaluated in such a frame. Furthemore, it should be observed that a\u03b1\ncontains both, gravitational (in the self-gravitating case) and \"kinematical\"\ncontributions. Since in the concept of e.i.m. only the later should appear, we\nhave to evaluate (2) not only in the i.r.f., but also in the locally Minkowskian\nframe (l.m.f.) where local gravitational effects vanish. Formally, this may be\nachieved, either by introducing locally Minkowskian coordinates or equivalently, by considering a tetrad field attached to such l.m.f.. Denoting by a\ntilde the components of tensors in the l.m.f.,equation (2) reads\n(\u03c1 + p)\u00e3\u03bc = h\u0303\u03bc\u03bd p,\u03bd\n\n(5)\n\nEvaluating (5) in the i.r.f., it becomes clear that (\u03c1 + p) defines the e.i.m.\ndensity of any fluid element (a well known fact, see for example [9]).\nIn order to better illustrate this point, let us consider the spherically\nsymmetric case.\nThus, let the line element be\nds2 = e\u03bd dt2 \u2212 e\u03bb dr 2 \u2212 r 2 (d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 )\n\n(6)\n\nwith \u03bd = \u03bd(r, t) and \u03bb = \u03bb(r, t), then locally Minkowski coordinates may be\nintroduced by [10]\ndT = e\u03bd/2 dt\n\ndx = e\u03bb/2 dr\n\ndy = rd\u03b8\n\ndz = rsin\u03b8d\u03c6\n\n(7)\n\nsatisfying\nds2 = dT 2 \u2212 dx2 \u2212 dy 2 \u2212 dz 2\n\n(8)\n\nNext, the four-velocity vector for any fluid element, in the frame of (6) is\n\u03bc\n\nu =\n\ne\u2212\u03bd/2\n\u03c9e\u2212\u03bb/2\n\u221a\n\u221a\n,\n, 0, 0\n1 \u2212 \u03c92\n1 \u2212 \u03c92\n4\n\n!\n\n(9)\n\n\fwhere \u03c9 is the radial velocity of the fluid element as measured in the l.m.f.\nTherefore, in the l.m.f. the components of (9) are\n\u0169\u03bc = \u221a\n\n\u03b4T\u03bc\n\u03c9\u03b4 \u03bc\n\u221a x\n+\n1 \u2212 \u03c92\n1 \u2212 \u03c92\n\n(10)\n\nand the components of the four-acceleration in the l.m.f. read\n\u00e3\u03bc = \u0169\u03bd \u0169\u03bc,\u03bd\n\n(11)\n\nThen, feeding back (11) into (5), and evaluating in the i.r.f. (\u03c9 = 0), we\nobtain the \"Newtonian-type\" equation\n(\u03c1 + p)\u03c9,T = \u2212p,x\n\n(12)\n\nindicating that (\u03c1 + p) represents the e.i.m. density of the fluid.\nLet us now turn to the dissipative case.\n\n3\n\nThe e.i.m. density of a dissipative fluid\n\nFor simplicity we shall consider the case of pure heat conduction, neglecting\nviscosity terms. Then, the energy-momentum tensor takes the usual form\nT\u03bc\u03bd = (\u03c1 + p)u\u03bc u\u03bd \u2212 pg\u03bc\u03bd + q\u03bc u\u03bd + q\u03bd u\u03bc\n\n(13)\n\nand the equation of motion, projected onto the plane orthogonal to u\u03bc reads\n\u03bc \u03bd\n(\u03c1 + p)a\u03b1 \u2212 p,\u03bd h\u03bd\u03b1 + h\u03b1\u03bc q;\u03bd\nu + q \u03b1 u\u03bd;\u03bd + q \u03bd u\u03bc;\u03bd h\u03b1\u03bc = 0\n\n(14)\n\nwhere q \u03bc , satisfying q \u03bc u\u03bc = 0, denotes the heat flow vector.\nWe have now to adopt a transport equation for q \u03bc . Although this is still\na matter of discussion, it should be borne in mind that some kind of hyperbolic dissipative theory [11] should be applied in order to avoid violation of\ncausality and other undesirable consequences derived from the (parabolic)\nEckart-Landau approach. Furthermore, since we are interested in the transient regime between two equilibrium states we are compelled to use a hyperbolic theory, for it is known that the parabolic theory assumes that the\nsystem is relaxed at all times.\n5\n\n\fThus, we shall consider the Israel-Stewart transport equation [11] (although any hyperbolic equation yielding a Cattaneo-type [11] equation in\nthe non-relativistic limit would lead to the same result)\n\u03c4 u\u03b1\n1\n\u03c4 h\u03bc\u03bd q\u0307 \u03bd + q \u03bc = \u03bah\u03bc\u03bd (T,\u03bd \u2212 T a\u03bd ) \u2212 \u03baT 2\n2\n\u03baT 2\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\nq \u03bc + \u03c4 \u03c9 \u03bc\u03bd q\u03bd\n\n(15)\n\n;\u03b1\n\nwhere \u03c4, \u03ba, T and \u03c9 \u03bc\u03bd denote the relaxation time, the thermal conductivity,\nthe temperature and the vorticity tensor, respectively.\nThen, feeding back (15) into (14) one obtains\n1\n\u03baT\n\u2212 p,\u03bd h\u03bd\u03b1 \u2212 (q \u03b1 \u2212 \u03bah\u03b1\u03bd T,\u03bd )\na \u03c1+p\u2212\n\u03c4\n\u03c4\n!\n\u03b2\n1\n\u03c4u\n\u2212\n\u03baT 2\nq \u03b1 + 2\u03c9 \u03b1\u03bd q\u03bd + q \u03b1 \u0398 + q \u03bd \u03c3\u03bd\u03b1 = 0\n2\n2\u03c4\n\u03baT ;\u03b2\n\u03b1\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\n(16)\n\nwith\n\u0398 = u\u03bd;\u03bd\n\u03c3\u03bc\u03bd as usual denotes the shear tensor, and where the relation [12]\n1\nu\u03b1;\u03b2 = \u03c9\u03b1\u03b2 + \u03c3\u03b1\u03b2 \u2212 \u0398h\u03b1\u03b2 \u2212 a\u03b1 u\u03b2\n3\n\n(17)\n\nhas been used.\nWe shall now consider that our system is initially, either in hydrostatic\nequilibrium without dissipation, or very close to equilibrium with \"small\"\ndissipation (quasi-stationary regime). Next, let us suppose that at some\nmoment (say t = t\u0303) it leaves the initial state entering into a dissipative\nregime.\nThen, \"immediately\" after departure from equilibrium (or quasi-equilibrium),\nwhere \"immediately\" means on a time scale of the order of \u03c4 (or smaller),\nthe last four terms in (16) can be neglected, and we have\n\u03b1\n\na\n\n\u03baT\n\u03c1+p\u2212\n\u03c4\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n\u2212 p,\u03bd h\u03bd\u03b1 \u2212\n\n1 \u03b1\n(q \u2212 \u03bah\u03b1\u03bd T,\u03bd ) = 0\n\u03c4\n\n(18)\n\nThe components of (18) in the l.m.f. are\n\u0012\n\n\u00e3\u03bc \u03c1 + p \u2212\n\n\u03baT\n\u03c4\n\n\u0013\n\n\u2212 p,\u03bd h\u0303\u03bc\u03bd \u2212\n6\n\n\u0011\n1\u0010 \u03bc\nq\u0303 \u2212 \u03bah\u0303\u03bc\u03bd T,\u03bd = 0\n\u03c4\n\n(19)\n\n\fHowever, in the l.m.f., the components of the heat flux vector in the i.r.f.,\nin the quasi-stationary regime, satisfy the \"Maxwell-Fourier\" equation\nq\u0303 \u03bc = \u03bah\u0303\u03bc\u03bd T,\u03bd\n\n(20)\n\nIndeed, just after leaving the equilibrium, the absolute value of the heat\nflow vector is the same as that corresponding to the quasistationary regime,\nand furthermore in that regime (in the l.m.f. and in the i.r.f.) both the\nkinematical and gravitational contributions to the four acceleration vanish, thereby justifying (20).Therefore , just after leaving the quasi-stationary\nregime, the last term in (19) vanishes, and this equation becomes\n\u0012\n\n\u00e3\u03bc \u03c1 + p \u2212\n\n\u03baT\n\u03c4\n\n\u0013\n\n= p,\u03bd h\u0303\u03bc\u03bd\n\n(21)\n\nimplying that the e.i.m. density is given by\n\u03c1+p\u2212\n\n\u03baT\n\u03c4\n\n(22)\n\nor,\n(\u03c1 + p)(1 \u2212 \u03b1)\nwith\n\u03b1\u2261\n\n4\n\n\u03baT\n\u03c4 (\u03c1 + p)\n\n(23)\n(24)\n\nDiscussion\n\nWe have seen that just after leaving the equilibrium the e.i.m. density of\nthe dissipative fluid reduces its value (as compared to the non-dissipative\nsituation) by the factor\n1\u2212\u03b1\n(25)\ngiving rise, in principle, to the possibility of vanishing (\u03b1 = 1) or even negative (\u03b1 > 1) e.i.m. density. As mentioned in the Introduction, such effect\nwas already found in some specific examples, here it appears as a general\nresult for any dissipative fluid (self-gravitating or not).\nIt should be noticed that since the system is evaluated immediately (in\nthe sense explained above) after leaving the equlibrium (or quasi-equilibrium)\n7\n\n\fthen the physical meaning of thermodynamical variables (their values), are\nextrapolated from the state of equilibrium, and therefore any discussion\nabout difficulties of interpreting such variables in a transient regime, is out\nof the point.\nAlso, it should be observed that causality and stability conditions hindering the system to attain condition \u03b1 = 1, are obtained on the basis of a\nlinear approximation, whose validity, close to the critical point (\u03b1 = 1), is\nquestionable [13].\nAt any rate, examples of fluids attaining the critical point and exhibiting\nreasonble physical properties have been presented elsewhere [14, 15].\nIn order to evaluate \u03b1, let us turn back to c.g.s. units. Then, assuming\nfor simplicity \u03c1 + p \u2248 2\u03c1, we obtain\n\u03baT\n[\u03ba][T ]\n\u2248\n\u00d7 10\u221242\n\u03c4 (\u03c1 + p)\n[\u03c4 ][\u03c1]\n\n(26)\n\nwhere [\u03ba], [T ], [\u03c4 ], [\u03c1] denote the numerical values of these quantities in\nerg. s\u22121 cm\u22121 K \u22121 , K, s and g. cm\u22123 , respectively.\nObviously, this will be a very small quantity (compared to 1), unless\nconditions for extremely high values of \u03ba and T are attained. In this respect,\nobserve that although small values of \u03c4 increases (26), they are of little\nhelp since (22) is valid only on a time scale of the order of \u03c4 . Therefore, a\ndecreasing of e.i.m. density with physically relevant consequences requires\nvalues of (26) close to the unit, due to large values of \u03ba and T but nonnegligible values of \u03c4 .\nAt present we may speculate that \u03b1 may decrease substantially (for nonnegligible values of \u03c4 ) in a pre-supernovae event\nIndeed, at the last stages of massive star evolution, the decreasing of\nthe opacity of the fluid, from very high values preventing the propagation\nof photons and neutrinos (trapping [16]), to smaller values, gives rise to\nradiative heat conduction. Under these conditions both \u03ba and T could be\nsufficiently large as to imply a substantial increase of \u03b1. Indeed, the values\nsuggested in [17] ([\u03ba] \u2248 1037 ; [T ] \u2248 1013 ; [\u03c4 ] \u2248 10\u22124; [\u03c1] \u2248 1012 ) lead to\n\u03b1 \u2248 1. The obvious consequence of which would be to enhance the efficiency\nof whatever expansion mechanism, of the central core, at place, because of\nthe decreasing of its e.i.m. density. At this point it is worth noticing that the\nrelevance of relaxational effects on gravitational collapse has been recently\nexhibited and stressed (see [18], and references therein)\n8\n\n\fIt is also worth noticing that the inflationary equation of state (in the\nperfect fluid case) \u03c1 + p = 0, is, as far as the equation of motion is concerned,\nequivalent to \u03b1 = 1 in the dissipative case (both imply the vanishing of the\ne.i.m. density).\nAlso observe, that if we impose the equation of state \u03c1 + p = 0, in the\ndissipative case, then the resulting e.i.m. density is negative (- \u03baT\n), implying\n\u03c4\nthat the attractive gravitational force leads to an overall expansion.\nFinally, it is worth stressing that it is the first term on the left in (15),\nthe direct responsible for the decreasing in the e.i.m density, all terms including kinematical variables vanishing within the time scale considered (after\nleaving equilibrium). Therefore any hyperbolic dissipative theory yielding\na Cattaneo-type equation in the non-relativistic limit, is expected to give a\nresult similar to the one obtained here.\n\nAcknowledgements\nThe financial assistance from M.C.T.,Spain, BFM2000-1322 is gratefully acknowledged.\n\nReferences\n[1] Rindler W 1977 Essential Relativity, 2nd edition, (Springer-Verlag,\nBerlin).\n[2] Herrera L, Di Prisco A, Hern\u00e1ndez-Pastora J L, Mart\u0131\u0301n J and Mart\u0131\u0301nez\nJ, 1997 Class.
