Introduction\n1.1. What is a q-holonomic sequence? A sequence of rational functions fn (q) \u2208 Q(q) in a variable q is\nq-holonomic if it satisfies a linear recursion with coefficients polynomials in q and q n . In other words, we\nhave\n\n(1)\n\nd\nX\n\nai (q n , q)fn+i (q) = 0\n\ni=0\n\nwhere the coefficients ai (M, q) \u2208 Z[M, q] are polynomials for i = 0, . . . , d where ad (M, q) 6= 0. The term\nwas coined by Zeilberger in [Z] and further studied in [WZ]. q-holonomic sequences appear in abundance in\nEnumerative Combinatorics; [PWZ, St]. The fundamental theorem of Wilf-Zeilberger states that a multidimensional finite sum of a (proper) q-hyper-geometric term is always q-holonomic; see [WZ, Z, PWZ]. Given\nthis result, one can easily construct q-holonomic sequences. Combining this fundamental theorem with the\nfact that many state-sum invariants in Quantum Topology are multi-dimensional sums of the above shape,\nit follows that Quantum Topology provides us with a plethora of q-holonomic sequences of natural origin;\n[GL]. For example, the sequence of Jones polynomials of a knot and its parallels which we will study below\n(technically, the colored Jones function) is q-holonomic.\nThe goal of our paper is to assign a tropical curve to a q-holonomic sequence. To motivate the connection\nbetween q-holonomic sequences and tropical curves, we will write Equation (1) in operator form using the\noperators M, L which act on a sequence fn (q) \u2208 Q(q) by\n(M f )n (q) = q n fn (q),\n\n(Lf )n (q) = fn+1 (q).\n\nIt is easy to see that LM = qM L generate the q-Weyl algebra\n(2)\n\nW = Z[q \u00b11 ]hM, Li/(LM \u2212 qM L)\n\nEquation (1) becomes\n(3)\n\nPf = 0\n\nwhere\n(4)\n\nP =\n\nd\nX\n\nai (M, q)Li \u2208 W.\n\ni=0\n\nIn other words, Equation (4) says that P annihilates f . Although a q-holonomic sequence f is annihilated\nby many operators P \u2208 W , it was observed in [Ga2] that it is possible to canonically choose an operator Pf\nwith coefficients ai (M, q) \u2208 Z[M, q]. Likewise, there is a unique non-homogeneous linear recursion relation\nof the form Pf f = bf where bf \u2208 Z[M, q]. For a detailed definition, see Section 2 below.\nDefinition 1.1. We call Pf and (Pfnh , bf ) the homogeneous and the non-homogeneous annihilator of the\nq-holonomic sequence f .\n1.2. What is a tropical curve? In this section we will recall the definition of a tropical curve. For a\nsurvey on tropical curves, see [RGST, SS]. With those conventions, a tropical polynomial P : R2 \u2212\u2192 R is a\nfunction of the form:\n(5)\n\nP (x, y) = min{a1 x + b1 y + c1 , . . . , ar x + br y + cr }\n\nwhere ai , b, ci are rational numbers for i = 1, . . . , r. P is convex and piecewise linear. The tropical curve T (P )\nof the tropical polynomial P is the set of points (x, y) \u2208 R2 such that P is not linear at (x, y). Equivalently,\nT (P ) is the set of points where the minimum is attained at two or more linear functions. A rational graph\n\u0393 is a finite union of rays and segments whose endpoints and directions are rational numbers, and each ray\nhas a positive integer multiplicity. A balanced rational graph is defined in [RGST, Eqn.10]: at every vertex\nthe sum of the slope vectors with multiplicities adds to zero. Every tropical curve is a balanced rational\ngraph and vice-versa; see [RGST, Thm.3.6]. Tropical curves are very computable objects. For example,\nthe vertices of a rational curve are the points (x, y) where the minimum in (5) is attained at least three\n\n\fKNOTS AND TROPICAL CURVES\n\n3\n\ntimes. The coordinates of such points can be solved by solving a system of linear equations. An explicit\nalgorithm to compute the vertices and the slopes of a tropical curve is given in [RGST, Sec.3], and a computer\nimplementation in Singular is available from [Ma]. This allows us to compute the tropical curves of the 41 ,\n52 and 61 knots in Sections 5.1-5.4 below. In the case of the 61 knot, the non-homogeneous tropical curve is\ndefined by an explicit polynomial with r = 346 terms.\nTropical curves arise from 2-variable polynomials Pt (x, y) whose coefficients depend on an additional\nparameter t as follows. Consider\n(6)\n\nPt (x, y) =\n\nr\nX\n\n\u03b3i (t)xai y bi\n\ni=1\n\nwhere \u03b3i (t) are algebraic functions of t with order at t = 0 equal to ci . Then, the corresponding tropical\npolynomial is given by (5). Pt (x, y) gives rise to two Newton polytopes:\n\u2022 The 3-dimensional Newton polytope NP , i.e., the convex hull of the exponents of (x, y, t) in Pt (x, y).\n\u2022 The 2-dimensional Newton polygon NP,0 , i.e., the convex hull of the exponents of (x, y) in Pt (x, y).\nIn fact, NP,0 is the image of NP under the projection map (x, y, t) \u2212\u2192 (x, y). The lower faces of NP give\nrise to a Newton subdivision of NP,0 which is combinatorially dual to the tropical curve T (P ); see [RGST].\nThe polynomials Pt (x, y) appear frequently in numerical problems of Path Homotopy Continuation where\none is interested to connect P0 (x, y) to P1 (x, y). They also appear in Quantization problems in Physics, where\nt (or log t) plays the role of Planck's constant. We will explain below that they also appear in Quantum\nTopology, and they are a natural companion of the AJ and the Slope Conjecture.\n1.3. The tropical curve of a q-holonomic sequence. In this section we associate a tropical surve to a\nq-holonomic sequence. The main observation is that an element of the q-Weyl algebra is a polynomial in 3\nvariables M, L, q. Two of those q-commute (i.e., satisfy LM = qM L) but we can always sort the powers of\nL to the right and the powers of M to the left. In other words, there is an additive map\n(7)\n\nZ[q \u00b11 ]hM, Li/(LM \u2212 qM L) \u2212\u2192 Z[M, L, q \u00b11 ]\n\nLet us change variables (x, y, 1/t) = (L, M, q) and ignore the coefficients of the monomials of xi y j tk , and\nrecord only their exponents. They give rise to a tropical curve. Explicitly, let\nX\nai,j,k q k M j Li \u2208 W\n(8)\nP =\n(i,j,k)\u2208A\n\ndenote an element of the q-Weyl elgebra, where A is a finite set and ai,j,k \u2208 Z \\ {0} for all (i, j, k) \u2208 A.\nDefinition 1.2. There is a map\n(9)\n\nW \u2212\u2192 {Tropical Curves in R2 },\n\nP 7\u2192 \u0393P\n\nwhich assigns to P in (9) the tropical polynomial Pt (x, y) given by:\nPt (x, y) =\n\nmin {ix + jy \u2212 k}\n\n(i,j,k)\u2208A\n\n\u0393P is the tropical curve of Pt (x, y).\nCombining Definitions 1.1 and 1.2 allows us to assign a tropical curve to a q-holonomic sequence f .\nDefinition 1.3. (a) If f is a q-holonomic sequence, let \u0393f and \u0393nh\nf denote the tropical curves of Pf (y, x, 1/t)\nnh\nnh\nand Pf (y, x, 1/t) respectively, where Pf (M, L, q) and Pf (M, L, q) are given in Definition 1.1.\nThe tropical curve \u0393f of a q-holonomic sequence f is closely related to the degree (with respect to q) of\nthe sequence of rational functions fn (q). If \u03b4n = degq (fn (q)) denotes this degree, then it was shown in [Ga4]\nthat for large enough n, \u03b4n is a quadratic quasi-polynomial with slope recorded by the rays of the tropical\ncurve \u0393f .\n\n\f4\n\nSTAVROS GAROUFALIDIS\n\n1.4. 3 polytopes of a q-holonomic sequence. In this section we assign 3 polytopes to a q-holonomic\nsequence.\nDefinition 1.4. (a) If P \u2208 W is given by Equation (8), it defines 3 polytopes:\n\u2022 NP is the convex hull of the exponents of the polynomial P (M, L, q) with respect to the variables\n(M, L, q).\n\u2022 NP,0 is the projection of NP under the projection map (M, L, q) \u2212\u2192 (L, M ).\n\u2022 NP,1 is the convex hull of the exponents of the polynomial P (L, M, 1).\n(b) If f is a q-holonomic sequence, its annihilator Pf gives rise to the polytopes NPf , NPf ,0 and NPf ,1 .\nNote that NP is a 3-dimensional convex lattice polytope, and NP,0 , NP,1 are 2-dimensional convex lattice\npolygons. Since every exponent of P (M, L, 1) comes from some exponents of P (M, L, q), it follows that\n(10)\n\nNP,1 \u2282 NP,0\n\nRemark 1.5. It follows by [RGST] that the tropical curve \u0393P is dual to a Newton subdivision of NP,0 .\nWe will say that P (M, L, q) is good if NP,1 = NP,0 . It is easy to see that goodness is a generic property.\n1.5. The slopes of a q-holonomic sequence. In this section we discuss the slopes of a q-holonomic\nsequence and their relation with its tropical curve. The proof of the following theorem uses differential\nGalois theory and the Lech-Mahler-Skolem theorem from number theory.\nTheorem 1. [Ga4] The degree with respect to q of a q-holonomic sequence fn (q) \u2208 Q(q) is given (for large\nvalues of n) by a quadratic quasi-polynomial.\nRecall that a quadratic quasi-polynomial is a function of the form:\n\u0012 \u0013\nn\n(11)\np : N \u2212\u2192 N,\np(n) = \u03b32 (n)\n+ \u03b31 (n)n + \u03b30 (n)\n2\nwhere \u03b3j (n) are rational-valued periodic functions of n. Quasi-polynomials appear in lattice point counting\nproblems, and also in Enumerative Combinatorics; see [BP, BR, Eh, St] and references therein.\nThe set of slopes s(p) of a quadratic quasi-polynomial is the finite set of values of the periodic function\n\u03b32 (n). These are essentially the quadratic growth rates of the quasi-polynomial. More precisely, recall that\nx \u2208 R is a cluster point of a sequence (xn ) of real numbers if for every \u01eb > 0 there are infinitely many indices\nn \u2208 N such that |x \u2212 xn | < \u01eb. Let {xn }\u2032 denote the set of cluster points of a sequence (xn ). It is easy to\nshow that for every quadratic quasi-polynomial p we have:\n2\np(n) |n \u2208 N}\u2032 \u2282 Q\nn2\nGiven a q-holonomic sequence fn (q) \u2208 Q(q), let s(f ) denote the slopes of the quadratic quasi-polynomial\ndegq fn (q). Let s(N ) denote the set of slopes of the edges of a convex polygon N in the plane. The next\nproposition relates the slopes of a q-holonomic sequence with its tropical curve.

Let \u03b4(n) = degq fn (q) denote the degree of fn (q) with respect to q, and let P denote the annihilator\nof f . We expand P in terms of monomials as in Equation (8). For every monomial q k M j Li and every n we\nhave\ndegq ((q k M j Li )fn (q)) = k + jn + \u03b4(n + i).\nSince P annihilates f , for every n the following maximum is attained at least twice (from now on, twice will\nmean at least twice as is common in Tropical Geometry):\n(13)\n\nmax {jn + k + \u03b4(n + i)}\n\n(i,j,k)\n\n\fKNOTS AND TROPICAL CURVES\n\n5\n\nSubtracting \u03b4(n), it follows that the maximum is obtained twice:\n(14)\n\nmax {jn + k + \u03b4(n + i) \u2212 \u03b4(n)}\n\n(i,j,k)\n\nNow \u03b4(n) is a quadratic quasi-polynomial given by\n\u0012 \u0013\nn\n\u03b4(n) = \u03b32 (n)\n+ \u03b31 (n)n + \u03b30 (n)\n2\nTheorem 1 implies that for large enough n, in a fixed arithmetic progression, we have \u03b3i (n) = \u03b3\nbi for i = 1, 2,\nthus\n\u0012 \u0013\ni\n+\u03b3\nb1 i\n\u03b4(n + i) \u2212 \u03b4(n) = b\n\u03b32 i n + \u03b3\nb2\n2\nSubstituting into (14), it follows that for large enough n in an arithmetic progression, the max is obtained\ntwice:\n\u0012 \u0013\ni\n+\u03b3\nb1 i}\n(15)\nmax {jn + k + \u03b3\nb2 i n + \u03b3\nb2\n(i,j,k)\n2\nIt follows that there exists (i\u2032 , j \u2032 ) 6= (i, j) such that\n(16)\n\n\u03b3\nb2 = \u2212\n\nThis proves Proposition 1.6.\n\nj \u2212 j\u2032\n.\ni \u2212 i\u2032\n\u0003\n\n2. The q-Weyl alegbra and its localization\nIn this section we will discuss some algebraic properties of the q-Weyl algebra and its localization, which\nwill justify Definition 1.1.\nRecall the q-Weyl algebra from (2). We will say that an element P of W is reduced if it has the form (4)\nwhere ai (M, q) \u2208 Z[M, q] for all i, and the greatest common divisor of ai (M, q) \u2208 Z[M, q] is 1.\nConsider the localized q-Weyl algebra Wloc given by\n(17)\n\nWloc = Q(M, q)hLi/(Lf (M, q) \u2212 f (M q, q)L)\n\nIt was observed in [Ga2] that W is not a principal left-ideal domain, but becomes so after localization; see\n[Cou]. If f is a sequence of rational functions, consider the left ideal Mf\nMf = {P \u2208 Wloc |P f = 0}\nMf is a principal ideal, which is nonzero if f is q-holonomic. Let P \u2032 denote the monic generator of Mf . Left\nmultiply it by a polynomial in M, q so as to obtain a reduced annihilator Pf of f .\nNow, we discuss non-homogeneous recursion relations of the form\nd\nX\n\nai (q n , q)fn+i (q) = b(q n , q)\n\ni=0\n\nwhere ai (M, q), b(M, q) \u2208 Q(M, q) for all i. In operator form, we can write the above recursion as\nP f = b.\nConsider the left ideal\n(18)\n\nMfnh = {P \u2208 Wloc |\u2203b \u2208 Q(M, q) : P f = b}\n\nIt is easy to see that Mfnh is a left ideal. If f is q-holonomic, Mfnh 6= 0. Let P \u2032\u2032 denote the monic generator\nof Mfnh . There exists b\u2032\u2032 \u2208 Q(M, q) such that\nP \u2032\u2032 f = b\u2032\u2032\nThere are two cases: b\u2032\u2032 6= 0 or b\u2032\u2032 = 0. If b\u2032\u2032 6= 0, then dividing by b\u2032\u2032 we obtain that 1/b * P \u2032\u2032 f = 1. We left\nmultiply both sides by a polynomial in M, q so as to obtain Pfnh f = bf where P nh is reduced. If b\u2032\u2032 = 0 then\n\n\f6\n\nSTAVROS GAROUFALIDIS\n\nmultiply by a polynomial in M, q so as to obtain Pfnh f = 0 and define bf = 0 in tha case. This concludes\nDefinition 1.1.\nThe next lemma relates the homogeneous and the non-homogeneous annihilator of a q-holonomic sequence.\nIt is well-known that one can convert an non-homogeneous recursion relation P f = b where b 6= 0 into a\nhomogeneous recursion relation of order one more. Indeed, P f = b where b 6= 0 is equivalent to\n(L \u2212 1)b\u22121 P f = 0\nThis implies the following conversion between (Pfnh , bf ) and Pf . Fix a q-holonomic sequence fn (q) \u2208 Q(q).\nLemma 2.1. (a) If bf = 0 then Pfnh = Pf . If bf 6= 0, then Pfnh is obtained by clearing denominators of\n(L \u2212 1)b\u22121\nf Pf by putting the powers of L on the right and the elements of Q(M, q) on the left.\n(b) If Pf is not left divisible by L \u2212 1 in W , then Pf = Pfnh and bf = 0. If Pf is left divisible by L \u2212 1 in\nW , then Pf = (L \u2212 1)Qf and if d is the common denominator of Qf , then (dQf , d) = (Pfnh , bf ).\nDefinition 2.2. We say that a q-holonomic sequence f is homogeneous if bf = 0\u2013else f is non-homogeneous.\nIn other words, a q-holonomic sequence f is homogeneous if and only if Pf is left-divisible by L \u2212 1 in W .\n3. Quantum Topology\n3.1. The tropical curve of a knot. Quantum Topology is a source of q-holonomic sequences attached to\nknotted 3-dimensional objects. Let JK,n (q) \u2208 Z[q \u00b11 ] denote the colored Jones polynomial of a knot K in\n3-space, colored by the (n + 1)-dimensional irreducible representation of sl2 and normalized to be 1 at the\nunknot; [Jo, Tu]. The sequence JK,n (q) for n = 0, 1, . . . essentially encodes the Jones polynomial of a knot\nand all of its parallels; see [Tu]. In [GL, Thm.1] it was shown that the sequence JK,n (q) of colored Jones\npolynomials of a knot K is q-holonomic.\nDefinition 3.1. (a) If K is a knot, we denote by AK (M, L, q) and (Anh\nK (M, L, q), BK (M, q)) the homogeneous\nand the non-homogeneous annihilator of the q-holonomic sequence JK,n (q). These are the non-commutative\nand the non-homogeneous non-commutative A-polynomials of the knot.\nnh\n(b) If K is a knot, let \u0393K and \u0393nh\nK denote the tropical curves of AK and AK respectively.\nThe non-homogeneous non-commutative A-polynomial of a knot appeared first in [GS].\n3.2. The AJ Conjecture. The AJ Conjecture (resp. the Slope Conjecture) relates the Jones polynomial\nof a knot and its parallels to the SL(2, C) character variety (resp. to slopes of incompressible surfaces) of\nthe knot complement. We will relate the two conjectures using elementary ideas from Tropical Geometry.\nThe A-polynomial of a knot is a polynomial in two commuting variables M and L that essentially encodes\nthe image of the SL(2, C) character variety of K, projected in C\u2217 \u00d7 C\u2217 by the eigenvalues of a meridian and\nlongitude of K. It was defined in [CCGLS].\nConjecture 1. [Ga2] The AJ Conjecture states that\n(19)\n\nAK (M, L, 1) = BK (M )AK (M 1/2 , L)\n\nwhere AK (M, L) is the A-polynomial of K and BK (M ) \u2208 Z[M ] is a polynomial that depends on M and of\ncourse K.\nThe AJ Conjecture is known for infinitely many 2-bridge knots; see [Le].\nIt is natural to ask whether the q-holonomic sequence JK,n (q) is of non-homogeneous type or not. Based\non geometric information (the so-called loop expansion of the colored Jones polynomial, see [Ga1]), as well\nas experimental evidence for all knots whose non-commutative A-polynomial is known (these are the torus\nknots in [Hi] and the twist knots in [GS]) we propose the following conjecture.\nConjecture 2. For every knot K, JK,n (q) is non-homogeneous.\nThe above conjecture implies that BK (M, q) \u2208 Z[M, q] \\ {0} is an invariant which is independent and\ninvisible from the classical A-polynomial of the knot. There is a close connection between the BK (M, q)\ninvariant of a knot and the torsion polynomial of the knot introduced in [DbG]. We will discuss this in a\nfuture publication.\n\n\fKNOTS AND TROPICAL CURVES\n\n7\n\n3.3. The Slope Conjecture. The Slope Conjecture of [Ga3] relates the degree of the colored Jones polynomial of a knot and its parallels to slopes of incompressible surfaces in the knot complement. To recall the\n\u2217\nconjecture, let \u03b4K (n) = degq JK,n (q) (resp. \u03b4K\n(n) = deg\u2217q JK,n (q)) denote the maximum (resp. minimum)\ndegree of the polynomial JK,n (q) \u2208 Z[q \u00b11 ] (or more generally, of a rational function) with respect to q.\nFor a knot K, define the Jones slopes jsK by:\n2\n(20)\njsK = { 2 \u03b4K (n) |n \u2208 N}\u2032\nn\n(b) Let bsK \u2282 Q \u222a {1/0} denote the set of boundary slopes of incompressible surfaces of K; [Ha, HO].\nConjecture 3. [Ga3] The Slope Conjecture states that for every knot K we have\n(21)\n\n2jsK \u2282 bsK .\n\nNote that the Slope Conjecture applied to the mirror of K implies that 2js\u2217K \u2282 bsK . The Slope Conjecture\nis known for alternating knots and torus knots (see [Ga3]), for adequate knots (which include all alternating\nknots; see [FKP]), for (\u22122, 3, n) pretzel knots (see [Ga3]), and for 2-fusion knots; see [DnG]. A general\nmethod for verifying the Slope Conjecture is discussed in [Ga5, DnG].\n3.4. The AJ Conjecture and the Slope Conjecture. In this section we will see how the AJ Conjecture\nrelates to the Slope Conjecture, expanding a comment of [Ga3, Sec.2]. We will specialize Definition 1.4 to\nknot theory when P = AK is the non-commutative A-polynomial of a knot K, and we will denote by NK ,\nNK,0 and NK,1 the three polytopes associated to AK . Proposition 1.6 implies that\n(22)\n\njsK \u2282 \u2212NK,0\n\nLet bsA\nK denote the slopes of the A-polynomial of K. The AJ Conjecture implies that up to possibly excluding\nthe slope 1/0 from 2NK,1 , we have:\n(23)\n\n2NK,1 = bsA\nK.\n\nFor a careful proof, see Proposition 3.2 and Remark 3.3 below. Culler and Shalen show that edges of the\nNewton polygon of the A-polynomial of K give rise to ideal points of the SL(2, C) character variety of K; see\n[CS, CGLS, CCGLS]. For every ideal point, Culler and Shalen construct an incompressible surface whose\nslope is a boundary slope of K; see [CS, CCGLS]. bsA\nK is the set of the so-called strongly detected boundary\nslopes of K, and satisfies the inclusion:\n(24)\n\nbsA\nK \u2282 bsK .\n\nIf AK (M, L, q) is good, then\n(25)\n\nNK,0 = NK,1 .\n\nIf K \u2217 denotes the mirror of K, then JK \u2217 ,n (q) = KK,n (q \u22121 ) which implies that \u2212NK,0 = NK \u2217 ,0 . Combining\nEquations (22)-(25), it follows that\n2jsK \u2282 bsK \u2217\nwhich is the Slope Conjecture, up to a harmless mirror image. This derivation also explains two independent\nfactors of 2, one in Equation (20) and another one in Equation (19).\nProposition 3.2. If the non-commutative A-polynomial of K is good, and if the AJ Conjecture holds, then\n\u0393K is dual to the Newton subdivision of the A-polynomial of K (multiplied by a polynomial in M ).\nProof. Let P denote the non-commutative A-polynomial of a knot K. \u0393K is dual to NP,0 . If P is good,\nthen NP,0 = NP,1 . With the notation of Conjecture 1, the AJ Conjecture implies that\nP (M, L, 1) = AK (M 1/2 , L)BK (M )\nwhere BK (M ) is a polynomial of M , and AK is the A-polynomial of A. The Newton polygon of of the product\nof two polynomials is the Minkowski sum of their Newton polygons. Moreover, the Newton polygon of BK (M )\nis a vertical line segment in the (L, M )-plane. It follows that the Newton polygon of AK (M 1/2 , L)BK (M ) is\n\n\f8\n\nSTAVROS GAROUFALIDIS\n\nthe Newton polygon of the A-polynomial of K and its translation by a vertical segment. On the other hand,\nthe Newton polygon of P (M, L, 1) is NP,1 . The result follows.\n\u0003\nRemark 3.3. Note that the Newton polygon of AK (M 1/2 , L)BK (M ) is the Newton polygon of AK (M 1/2 , L)\nand its shift by a vertical line segment. It follows that the slopes of the Newton polygon of AK (M 1/2 , L)BK (M )\nare the slopes of AK (M 1/2 , L) plus the slope of a vertical segment (i.e., 1/0). For concrete examples, see\nSection 5 where the Newton polygons of the non-homogeneous A-polynomials of 41 , 52 , 61 , 81 is shown and\nit differs from the Newton polygon of the A-polynomial by a shift by a vertical segment.\nThe only knots with explicitly known non-commutative A-polynomials (homogeneous and non-homogeneous)\nare the handful of twist knots Kp of [GS] for p = \u22128, . . . , 11. An explicit check shows that these noncommutative A-polynomials (both the homogeneous and the non-homogeneous) are good. For details, see\nSection 5.\n4. Quantization and Tropicalization\nQuantization is the process of producing the non-commutative A-polynomial of a knot from the usual\nA-polynomial. In other words, Quantization starts with P1 (x, y) and produces Pt (x, y) as in Equation (6).\nOn the other hand, Tropical Geometry expands Pt (x, y) at t = 0 (or equivalently at q = \u221e) and produces a\ntropical curve. Schematically, we have a diagram:\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\nnon-commutative\nA-polynomial\nTropical curve\nClassical limit\n\uf8ed A-polynomial \uf8f8 Tropicalization\n\u2190\u2212\n\u2212\u2192\nq=1\nq=\u221e\nq\nQuantization is a map reverse to the Classical Limit map in the above diagram. Both sides of the above\ndiagram (i.e., the limits at q = 1 and q = \u221e) are classical dual invariants of the knot. Indeed, the tropical\ncurve ought to be dual to a Newton subdivision of the A-polynomial of K. This duality is highly nontrivial,\neven for the simple case of the 41 knot, computed in Section 5.1 below.\nThis conjectured duality may be related to the duality between Chern-Simons theory (i.e., colored U(N )\npolynomials of a knot) and Enumerative Geometry (i.e., BPS states) of the corresponding Calabi-Yau 3-fold.\nFor a discussion of the latter duality, see [ADKMV, DGKV, LMV, DV] and references therein.\nPhysics principles concerning Quantization of complex Lagrangians in Chern-Simons theory suggest that\nthe A-polynomial of a knot should determine the non-commutative A-polynomial. In particular, it should\ndetermine the polynomial invariant BK (M, q) of Definition 1.1, and it should determine the tropical curves\n\u0393K and \u0393hn\nK .\nAside from duality conjectures, let us concentrate on a concrete question. It is well-known that the Apolynomial of a knot is a triangulated curve in the sense of algebraic K-theory. In other words, if X is the curve\nof zeros AK (M, L) = 0 of the A-polynomial then there exist nonzero rational functions z1 , . . . , zr \u2208 C(X)\u2217\nin X such that\n(26)\n\nM \u2227L=2\n\nr\nX\n\nzi \u2227 (1 \u2212 zi ) \u2208 \u22272Z (C(X)\u2217 )\n\ni=1\n\nwhere C(X) is the field of rational functions of X and M, L \u2208 C(X)\u2217 are the eigenvalues of the meridian\nand the longitude. For a proof of (26) (which uses the symplectic nature of the so-called Neumann-Zagier\nmatrices), see [Ch, Lem.10.1]. For an excellent discussion of triangulated curves X and for a plethora\nof examples and computations, see [BRVD]. Geometrically, a triangulation of X comes from an ideal\ntriangulation of the knot complement with r ideal tetrahedra with shape parameters z1 , . . . , zr which satisfy\nsome gluing equations. The symplectic nature of these gluing equations, introduced and studied by Neumann\nand Zagier in [NZ], implies (26). The triangulation of X has important arithmetic consequences regarding\nthe volume of the knot complement and its Dehn fillings, and it is closely related to the Bloch group of the\ncomplex numbers. It is important to realize that X has infinitely many triangulations, and in general it is\nnot possible to choose a canonical one. In addition, triangulations tend to work well with hyperbolic knots.\n\n\fKNOTS AND TROPICAL CURVES\n\n9\n\nOn the contrary, the non-commutative A-polynomial and its corresponding tropical curve exist for every\nknot in 3-space, hyperbolic or not. Let us end with some questions, which aside from its theoretical interest,\nmay play a role in the Quantization of the A-polynomial.\nQuestion 1. Is the tropical curve \u0393K of a hyperbolic knot K related to a triangulation of its A-polynomial\ncurve?\nTo formulate our next question, recall that the tropical curve \u0393K is dual to a Newton subdivision of\nthe 2-dimensional Newton polytope of the polynomial AK (M, L, q) with respect to the variables L and M .\nAssuming that AK (M, L, q) is good, and assuming the AJ Conjecture, it follows that \u0393K is dual to the\nNewton polygon of the A-polynomial of K. \u0393K is a balanced rational graph that consists or edges and\nrays, and the above assumptions imply that the slopes of the rays are negative inverses of the slopes of the\nA-polynomial of K. Consequently, Culler-Shalen theory (see [CS]) implies that the slopes of the rays of \u0393K\nare negative inverses of boundary slopes of K, appropriately normalized by a factor of 2.\nQuestion 2. What is the geometric meaning of the vertices of \u0393K (those are points in Q2 ) and of the slopes\nof the edges of \u0393K ?\n5. Computations of tropical curves of knots\n5.1. The homogeneous tropical curve of the 41 knot. The non-commutative A-polynomial A41 (M, L, q)\nof 41 was computed in [GL, Sec.6.2] and also [Ga2, Sec.3.2] using the WZ method of [WZ, Z] implemented by\n[PR] in Mathematica.
