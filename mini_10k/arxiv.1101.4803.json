Introduction\nWhile attending the August 2010 \"New Trends in Noncommutative Algebra\"\nconference in Seattle, the author of the present paper was told about the question\nwhether the K0 functor from AF C*-algebras to dimension groups splits, that is,\nhas a (categorical) right inverse. We describe here three reasons why this is not\nthe case. The first and the third reason are more conveniently expressed via the\nnonstable K0 -theory (often also called \"nonstable K-theory\") of a ring R, mainly\ndescribed by a commutative monoid, usually denoted by V(R). If R is unital,\nthen V(R) is the monoid of all isomorphism types of finitely generated projective\nright R-modules and K0 (R) is the Grothendieck group of V(R).\nOur first reason, Corollary 6.6, implies that the more general question, whether\nthe functor V has a right inverse from simplicial monoids (cf. Section 3) to exchange\nrings (cf. Warfield [30], and Ara [1] for the non-unital case), has a negative answer.\nDate: August 24, 2018.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. 19A49, 46L80, 16B50, 16B70, 16E20, 16E50, 16N60,\n18A30, 18C35, 06B20, 08B20, 03E05.\nKey words and phrases.

WEHRUNG\n\nActually, Corollary 6.6 is stated for an even more general class of rings that we call\nweakly V-semiprimitive rings. It also suggests that the original question might get\nmore interesting if one required the morphisms between dimension groups be oneto-one. Our second and third reason will address the modified K0 -splitting\nquestion.\nOur second reason, Proposition 7.1, involves the author's construction, introduced in Wehrung [31], of a dimension group with order-unit, of cardinality \u05d02 ,\nwhich is not isomorphic to V(R) for any (von Neumann) regular ring R. If K0 had\na right inverse from simplicial groups (cf. Section 3) to AF C*-algebras, then it\nwould also have a right inverse from simplicial groups to regular rings. However,\ndue to the abovementioned counterexample, this is impossible. There are some\ncomplications, due to the requirement that the maps between simplicial groups be\none-to-one, that we solve by using tools from lattice theory and universal algebra.\nOur third reason, Theorem 10.1, is the combinatorial core of our second reason.\n~ of simplicial monoids, indexed by a cube\nIt involves a commutative diagram D\n3\n(i.e., the powerset lattice {0, 1} of a three-element set), that has no lifting, with\nrespect to the functor V, by semiprimitive exchange rings. In particular, it can be\nlifted neither by C*-algebras of real rank 0 nor by regular rings. In particular, the\nnegative result of Proposition 7.1 extends both to regular rings (this could have\nbeen deduced directly from [31]) and to C*-algebras of real rank 0 (this is new).\n~ and L.\n~ Besides those three reasons, we also provide\nLifting the diagrams D\n~ while Thetwo positive representation results of the abovementioned diagram D:\n~\norem 10.1 implies that D cannot be lifted, with respect to the functor V, by any\ncommutative diagram of semiprimitive exchange rings, Theorem 11.2 implies that\n~ of the diagram D,\n~ can be lifted with\na certain \"collapsed\" image, denoted by L,\n~\nexchange rings, while Theorem 12.5 implies that L can be lifted with C*-algebras\n~ is\n(of real rank and stable rank both equal to 1). In order to be able to state that L\nreally a \"diagram\", we need the extended notion of diagram given in Definition 2.1.\n~ back to D,\n~ we obtain (Proposition 11.1) that D\n~ can also be lifted\nBy \"unfolding\" L\nwith exchange rings on the one hand, and with C*-algebras on the other hand.\nThere is no \"best of two worlds\", because a C*-algebra is an exchange ring iff it\n~ cannot be lifted by C*-algebras of real rank 0.\nhas real rank 0, and D\nThe journey back to the transfinite: separating the nonstable K0 -theory\nof exchange rings and the one of C*-algebras from the ones of regular\nrings and C*-algebras of real rank 0. The reason why we need a diagram\nindexed by a finite lattice lies in a quite technical result of categorical algebra by\nGillibert and the author [13] called the Condensate Lifting Lemma, CLL in short.\nCLL makes it possible to turn diagram counterexamples to object counterexamples,\nwith possible jumps of cardinality. It works only on diagrams indexed by so-called\nalmost join-semilattices, in particular for finite lattices.\nBy applying various instances of CLL to the negative lifting versus positive lifting\n~ we obtain (cf. Theorems 13.6 and 14.1) that there exists a\nresults of the cube D,\nunital exchange ring (resp., a unital C*-algebra of real rank 1) R, with stable rank 1\nand index of nilpotence 2, such that V(R) is the positive cone of a dimension group\nand V(R) is not isomorphic to V(B) for any ring B which is either a C*-algebra\nof real rank 0 or a regular ring. Due to the cardinality-jumping properties of the\n\n\fLIFTING DEFECTS IN NONSTABLE K0 -THEORY\n\n3\n\n\"condensate\" construction underlying CLL, the exchange ring that we construct\nhas \u05d03 elements, while the C*-algebra that we construct is \u05d03 -separable (it has also\nreal rank 1). Both the ring and the C*-algebra are stably finite, have stable rank 1\nand index of nilpotence 2, while the nonstable K0 -theory is the positive cone of a\ndimension group with order-unit of index 2.\nAlthough the present paper is written in the language of ring theory, a substantial\npart of our results and proofs draw their basic inspiration from related results in\nuniversal algebra and lattice theory. For example,\n\u2022 Corollary 6.6 (the \"first reason\") originates in T\u016fma and Wehrung [29,\nSection 8], which is a non-lifting result by universal algebras with respect\nto the congruence lattice functor.\n\u2022 Proposition 7.1 (the \"second reason\") originates in Wehrung [31], which\nsolves, in the negative, representation problems with respect to various\nfunctors, including K0 , by using the lattice structure of the set of all principal right ideals in a regular ring.\n~ (cf. Figure 10.1), which is the key ingredient of Theorem 10.1\n\u2022 The cube D\n(the \"third reason\"), originates in a cube of Boolean semilattices introduced in T\u016fma and Wehrung [29, Section 3].\nAcknowledgment.

Organization of the paper\nAll our rings will be associative, but not necessarily unital. We denote by 1R ,\nor 1 if R is understood, the unit of a ring R.\nAlthough we shall use standard commutative diagrams such as the one, denoted\n~ introduced in Figure 10.1, we shall also use sometimes diagrams of a more\nby D,\ngeneral kind, a formal definition of which follows.\nDefinition 2.1. A quiver is a quadruple I = (V, E, s, t) where V and E (the\n\"vertices\" and the \"edges\", respectively) are sets and s, t : E \u2192 V (the \"source\"\nand \"target\" map, respectively). An element e \u2208 E is thus viewed as an \"arrow\"\nfrom s(e) to t(e).\nA diagram in a category C, indexed by I, is a functor from I to C. Formally,\nit is given by a pair (\u03a6o , \u03a6m ), where \u03a6o (resp., \u03a6m ) is a map from V (resp., E)\nto the object class (resp., morphism class) of C, such that \u03a6m (e) is a morphism\nfrom \u03a6o (s(e)) to \u03a6o (t(e)) for any e \u2208 E. There is no composition of arrows in I,\nthus nothing to worry about at that level.\nThe usual definitions of a natural transformation and a natural equivalence carry\nover to diagrams without modification. For diagrams \u03a6, \u03a8 : I \u2192 C, we denote by\n\u03a6 \u223c\n= \u03a8 the natural equivalence of \u03a6 and \u03a8. For categories A and B, we say\nthat a diagram \u0393 : I \u2192 A lifts a diagram \u03a8 : I \u2192 B with respect to a functor\n\u03a6 : A \u2192 B if \u03a8 \u223c\n= \u03a6 \u0393 (cf. Figure 2.1). In all our lifting problems, we will need\nto specify additional composition relations among the arrows in the range of \u0393.\n\n\f4\n\nF.

We prove that every exchange ring is weakly\n~\nV-semiprimitive. We also introduce a diagram (in the sense of Definition 2.1) K\nof simplicial monoids with order-unit that has no lifting, with respect to the functor V, by weakly V-semiprimitive rings (Theorem 6.5). It follows (Corollary 6.6)\nthat the functor V has no right inverse from simplicial monoids with order-unit,\nwith normalized monoid homomorphisms, to weakly V-semiprimitive rings.\nIn Section 7, we prove (cf. Proposition 7.1) that the functor V has no right inverse from simplicial monoids with unit, and their embeddings, to AF C*-algebras.\nThe proof uses universal algebra, lattice theory, and a counterexample of cardinality \u05d02 constructed in Wehrung [31]. As Proposition 7.1 will be later superseded by\nstronger results, we give only an outline of the proof. Nevertheless we chose to keep\nit there, because a large part of the material in further sections originates from the\nproof of that result.\nIn Section 8 we introduce a tool that will prove essential for our work, the notion\nof a (pre)measured ring. By using some results of Section 4 and 5, we prove (cf.\nLemma 8.8) that the category of measured exchange rings is a reflective subcategory\nof the one of premeasured exchange rings. We also prove (cf. Lemma 8.9) an\nanalogous result for C*-algebras of real rank 0.\nIn Section 9, we introduce a common generalization of semiprimitive exchange\nrings, principal ideal domains, and polynomial rings over fields, that we call Vsemiprimitive rings. We also observe there that not every exchange ring, and not\nevery C*-algebra, is V-semiprimitive. The C*-algebra D constructed in Example 9.4\nwill play a crucial role in further sections.\nIn Section 10, we introduce the main combinatorial object of the paper, namely\n~ It is a {0, 1}3 -indexed commutative diagram of simplicial monoids,\nthe diagram D.\n\n\fLIFTING DEFECTS IN NONSTABLE K0 -THEORY\n\n5\n\n~\nand it originates in the proof of Proposition 7.1. Theorem 10.1 implies that D\nhas no lifting, with respect to the functor V, by any commutative diagram of Vsemiprimitive rings. This is the central non-representability result of the paper: all\nthe other negative lifting results of the paper, with the exception of Theorem 6.5,\nfollow from that one. The proof of Theorem 10.1 is direct: it does not involve\nany universal algebra, lattice theory, or transfinite cardinals. We also introduce\n~ of simplicial monoids and monoid eman auxiliary diagram, denoted there by E,\n~ with respect to the functor \u03a0 introduced in\nbeddings, such that any lifting of E,\n~ This implies, in particular, that the\nDefinition 8.6, gives rise to a lifting of D.\nfunctor V has no right inverse from simplicial monoids with order-unit, and their\nembeddings, to C*-algebras of real rank 0 (resp., regular rings), see Corollary 10.8.\nIn Section 11, we take advantage of the many symmetries underlying the di~ to collapse it to another diagram (now in the sense of Definition 2.1),\nagram D\n~ much simpler looking than D,\n~ such as every lifting of L\n~ gives rise\ndenoted by L,\n~\nto a lifting of D (this is shown in the argument of the proof of Proposition 11.1).\n~ (thus also D)\n~ can be lifted, with\nWe also prove, by a direct construction, that L\nrespect to the functor V, by exchange rings. In a sense, everything in that section\nboils down to finding a matrix c (given in (11.4)) satisfying the constraints given\nin (11.5) and (11.6).\n~ by C*-algebras. These C*-algebras\nIn Section 12, we construct a lifting of L\nhave both real rank and stable rank equal to 1, while they have index of nilpotence 2.\nBy using Theorem 10.1, it can be seen that these values are optimal.\nIn Section 13, we take advantage of the conflict between Theorem 10.1 (a non~ and Proposition 11.3 (a lifting result of D\n~ by exchange rings)\nlifting result of D)\nto construct, for every field K, a unital exchange K-algebra RK such that V(RK ),\nalthough being the positive cone of a dimension group, is never isomorphic to V(B)\nfor either a C*-algebra of real rank 0 or a regular ring B. Furthermore, RK has at\nmost \u05d03 + card K elements, and it has index of nilpotence 2. In order to achieve\nthis, we are using a fair amount of heavy machinery established earlier in the book\nGillibert and Wehrung [13]. That work introduces tools of categorical algebra and\ninfinite combinatorics, called larders and lifters, that are designed to turn diagram\ncounterexamples to object counterexamples. These tools are effective mainly on\n~\nlattice-indexed diagrams, which is the reason why we need to keep the cube D\n~\ninstead of the better looking L. The results of [13] being now used as a toolbox, it\nshould be possible to read the proofs of Section 13 without needing to ingest large\namounts of larder technology. In particular, the ring-theoretical and C*-algebraic\narguments used there are elementary.\nIn Section 14, we show how to extend to C*-algebras what we did for exchange\nrings in Section 13. In particular, we construct a unital C*-algebra E, of real rank\nand stable rank both equal to 1, such that V(E), although being the positive cone\nof a dimension group, is never isomorphic to V(B) for either a C*-algebra of real\nrank 0 or a regular ring B. Furthermore, E is \u05d03 -separable, and it has index of\nnilpotence 2.\nIn Section 15, we list some open problems.\nWe represent on Figure 2.2 the implications between the main attributes of rings\nused in the paper.\n\n\f6\n\nF.

Attributes of rings\n\n3. Basic notions about commutative monoids, refinement monoids,\ndimension groups\nWe refer to Goodearl [14] for partially ordered abelian groups, interpolation\ngroups, dimension groups. We set Z+ := {0, 1, 2, . . . } and N := Z+ \\ {0}.\nWe shall write all our commutative monoids additively. A submonoid I of a\ncommutative monoid M is an o-ideal of M if x + y \u2208 I implies that x \u2208 I and\ny \u2208 I, for all x, y \u2208 I. We say that M is conical if {0} is an o-ideal. Every\ncommutative monoid M can be endowed with its algebraic preordering \u2264, defined\nby x \u2264 y if there exists z \u2208 M such that y = x + z. We say that an element e \u2208 M\nis an order-unit of M if for each x \u2208 M there exists n \u2208 N such that x \u2264 ne. For\nn \u2208 Z+ , an element a \u2208 M has index at most n if (n + 1)x \u2264 a implies that x = 0,\nfor each x \u2208 M .\nIf I is an o-ideal of a commutative monoid M , the binary relation \u2261I on M\ndefined by\na \u2261I b \u21d0\u21d2 (\u2203x, y \u2208 I)(a + x = b + y) ,\n\nfor all a, b \u2208 M ,\n\n(3.1)\n\nis a monoid congruence of M , and M/I := M/\u2261I is a conical commutative monoid.\nThe Grothendieck group of M is the initial object in the category of all monoid\nhomomorphisms from M to a group. It consists of an abelian group G with a\nmonoid homomorphism \u03b5 : M \u2192 G, and we shall always endow it with the unique\ncompatible preordering with positive cone \u03b5(M ) (i.e., x \u2264 y iff y \u2212 x \u2208 \u03b5(M )).\nA commutative monoid M has the refinement property, or is a refinement monoid\n(cf. Dobbertin [9]), if for all a0 , a1 , b0 , b1 \u2208 M such that a0 + a1 = b0 + b1 , there are\ncj,k \u2208 M (for j, k \u2208 {0, 1}) such that aj = cj,0 + cj,1 and bj = c0,j + c1,j for each\nj \u2208 {0, 1}. A very special class of refinement monoids consists of the positive cones\nof dimension groups. A partially ordered abelian group G is a dimension group if it\nis directed (i.e., G = G+ +(\u2212G+ )), unperforated (i.e., mx \u2265 0 implies x \u2265 0 for each\nm \u2208 N and each x \u2208 G) and the positive cone G+ satisfies refinement. A simplicial\ngroup is a group of the form Zn , for a natural number n, ordered componentwise.\nEvery simplicial group is a dimension group. Conversely, every dimension group\nis a direct limit of simplicial groups (this follows from Effros, Handelman, and\nShen [10], but the form of this result established earlier in Grillet [18] is easily seen\n\n\fLIFTING DEFECTS IN NONSTABLE K0 -THEORY\n\n7\n\nto be equivalent). We shall also call a simplicial monoid the positive cone of a\nsimplicial group (i.e., (Z+ )n for some n \u2208 Z+ ).\nDefinition 3.1. For a subcategory C of the category CMon of conical commutative monoids with monoid homomorphisms, we shall denote by C(1) the category\nof monoids with order-unit in C: the objects of C(1) are the pairs (M, a), where M\nis an object of C and a is an order-unit of M , and a morphism from (M, a) to (N, b)\nis a monoid homomorphism f : M \u2192 N such that f (a) = b (i.e., f is normalized ).\n4. Basic notions about rings: nonstable K0 -theory, semiprimitivity\nDefinition 4.1. Not all of our rings will be unital, and consequently not all our ring\nhomomorphisms will preserve the unit. For a subcategory R of the category Ring\nof rings and ring homomorphisms, we shall denote by R(1) the subcategory of R\nconsisting of all unital rings in R, with unital ring homomorphisms, possibly with\nany additional structure present in R.\nFor example, we shall denote by RR0 the category of all C*-algebras of real\nrank 0 with C*-homomorphisms, and by RR0 (1) the category of all unital C*algebras of real rank 0 with unital C*-homomorphisms. A useful subcategory\nof RR0 is the full subcategory AF of all the approximately finite, or AF, C*algebras. By definition, a C*-algebra is AF if it is a (possibly uncountable) C*-direct\nlimit of finite-dimensional C*-algebras (not all our AF algebras will be separable).\nFor basic concepts about (stable or nonstable) K-theory of rings and C*-algebras,\nwe refer to Goodearl [17, Section 4] for the unital case, Ara [1, Section 3] for the\ngeneral case, Blackadar [6, Chapter 3] for the case of C*-algebras. For basic notions\nabout C*-algebras we refer to Murphy [23].\nFor a ring R (associative but not necessarily unital), we shall often identify\nthe ring\n\u0012 Mn\u0013(R) of all n \u00d7 n matrices over R with its image, via the embedding\nx 0\nx 7\u2192\n, in Mn+1 (R). Hence the elements of the (non-unital) ring M\u221e (R) :=\n0 0\nS\nn\u2208N Mn (R) can be identified with the countably infinite matrices with entries\nfrom R and only finitely many nonzero entries.\nWe define In (R) as the set of all idempotent elements of Mn (R), for each n \u2208\nN \u222a {\u221e}. For a ring homomorphism f : R \u2192 S, we denote by In (f ) the map from\nIn (R) to In (S) defined by the rule\n\u0001\n\u0001\nIn (f ) (aj,k )1\u2264j,k\u2264n := f (aj,k ) 1\u2264j,k\u2264n , for each (aj,k )1\u2264j,k\u2264n \u2208 In (R) .\nWe shall sometimes write f (a) instead of In (f )(a), for a \u2208 In (R).\nIdempotents a, b \u2208 I\u221e (R) are orthogonal if ab = ba = 0.\nThe (Murray-von Neumann, algebraic) equivalence of idempotents a, b \u2208 M\u221e (R)\nis defined by a \u223c b iff there are x, y \u2208 M\u221e (R) such that a = xy and b = yx.\nReplacing x by axb and y by bya, we see that we can assume that x = axb and\ny = bya. We denote by [a]R , or [a] if R is understood, the \u223c-equivalence class of a.\nFor all a, b \u2208 I\u221e (R) there exists b\u2032 \u223c b such that ab\u2032 = b\u2032 a = 0; it follows that\nequivalence classes can be added, via the formula\n[a] + [b] := [a + b] if ab = ba = 0 , for all a, b \u2208 I\u221e (R) .\n\n(4.1)\n\nThe set V(R) := {[a] | a \u2208 I\u221e (R)}, endowed with the addition defined in (4.1), is\na conical commutative monoid. If R is unital, then [1R ] is an order-unit of V(R)\nand V(R) is isomorphic to the monoid of all isomorphism types of finitely generated\n\n\f8\n\nF. WEHRUNG\n\nprojective right (resp., left) R-modules, with addition defined by [X]+[Y ] = [X \u2295Y ]\n(where [X] now denotes the isomorphism class of X). We shall also set V1 (R) :=\n(V(R), [1R ]).\nThe assignment R 7\u2192 V(R) can be extended to a functor from Ring to CMon:\nfor a homomorphism f : R \u2192 S of rings (resp., of unital rings), there is a unique\nmonoid homomorphism V(f ) : V(R) \u2192 V(S) such that V(f )([a]R ) = [I\u221e (f )(a)]S\nfor each a \u2208 I\u221e (R). The functor V preserves all direct limits (i.e., in categorical language, directed colimits) and finite products: for instance, V(limj\u2208I Rj ) \u223c\n=\n\u2212\u2192\n\u223c\nlimj\u2208I V(Rj ) (for direct limits) and V(R \u00d7 S) = V(R) \u00d7 V(S). All these facts ex\u2212\u2192\ntend to the unital case, giving a functor V1 : Ring(1) \u2192 CMon(1), with V1 (R) :=\n(V(R), [1R ]) for every unital ring R.\nIf R is unital, K0 (R) is defined as the (preordered) Grothendieck group of V(R).\nFor a two-sided ideal I of a ring R and the inclusion map f : I \u0592\u2192 R, the\nmap V(f ) embeds V(I) into V(R). We shall thus often identify V(I) with its\nimage, under V(f ), in V(R). It is an o-ideal of V(R) (cf. Section 3).\nLemma 4.2 (folklore). Let R be a ring, let c \u2208 I\u221e (R), and let \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 V(R). If\n[c] = \u03b1 + \u03b2, then there are orthogonal idempotents a, b \u2208 I\u221e (R) such that c = a + b,\n[a] = \u03b1, and [b] = \u03b2.\nNote. Observe, in particular, that if c \u2208 R, then a, b \u2208 R.\nProof. There are orthogonal idempotents u, v \u2208 I\u221e (R) such that [u] = \u03b1 and\n[v] = \u03b2. As [u + v] = \u03b1 + \u03b2 = [c], there are x, y \u2208 M\u221e (R) such that c = xy while\nu + v = yx. The matrices a := xuy and b := xvy are as required.\n\u0003\nThe following result is observed, for unital exchange rings R and E \u2286 R, in the\ncourse of the proof of Pardo [25, Teorema 4.1.7]. It is contained, in full generality,\nin Ara and Goodearl [2, Proposition 10.10].\nLemma 4.3. Let R be a ring, let E \u2286 I\u221e (R), and denote by I the two-sided ideal\nof R generated by the entries of all the elements of E. Then V(I) is the o-ideal\nof V(E) generated by {[x]R | x \u2208 E}.\nA ring R has index of nilpotence at most n if xn+1 = 0 implies that xn = 0 for\nall x \u2208 R. It is proved in Yu [33, Corollary 4] that every unital exchange ring with\nfinite index of nilpotence has stable rank 1. The following easy result gives some\nmore information.\nLemma 4.4. Let n be a positive integer and let R be a unital ring with index of\nnilpotence at most n. Then [1R ] has index at most n in V(R). Furthermore, if V(R)\nsatisfies the refinement property, then it is the positive cone of a dimension group.\nProof. Let \u03be \u2208 V(R) such that (n + 1)\u03be \u2264 [1]. By Lemma\nPn4.2, there are orthogonal\nidempotents e0 , . . . , en , a of R such that 1 = a + i=0 ej while [ej ] = \u03be for\neach j \u2264 n. For each j < n, let \u03c6j : ej R \u2192 ej+1 R be an isomorphism of right\nR-modules, and denote by \u03c6 the unique endomorphism of RR extending all the \u03c6j\nsuch that \u03c6(a) = \u03c6(en ) = 0. Setting x := \u03c6(1), we obtain that \u03c6n+1 = 0, thus\nxn+1 = 0, and thus, by assumption, xn = 0, so \u03c6n = 0, and so, as \u03c6n (e0 R) = en R,\nwe get en = 0, therefore \u03be = 0. This shows that [1] has index at most n in V(R).\nSuppose now that V(R) is a refinement monoid. As [1] is an order-unit in that\nmonoid, it follows that every element of V(R) has finite index (cf. Wehrung [32,\n\n\fLIFTING DEFECTS IN NONSTABLE K0 -THEORY\n\n9\n\nCorollary 3.12]), and so V(R) is the positive cone of a dimension group (cf. Wehrung\n[32, Proposition 3.13]).\n\u0003\nIn case R is a C*-algebra, each Mn (R), for n \u2208 N, is also a C*-algebra, and it\nis often convenient to replace algebraic equivalence of idempotents by *-equivalence\nof projections (a projection is a self-adjoint idempotent), namely,\n\u2217\n\na\u223cb\n\nif\n\n(\u2203x)(a = xx\u2217 and b = x\u2217 x) ,\n\nfor all projections a, b .\n\nThis can be done, because every idempotent in a C*-algebra is equivalent to a\nprojection (and even generates the same right ideal, cf. Kaplansky [21, Theorem 26,\np. 34]) and two projections are equivalent iff they are *-equivalent (cf. Kaplansky\n[21, Theorem 27, p. 35]).\nLemma 4.5. Let L be a left ideal in a C*-algebra A. Then every projection of L\nis equivalent to some projection of L.\nProof. Let e be a projection of L. There exists a self-adjoint a \u2208 L such that\nke \u2212 ak \u2264 1/3. By R\u00f8rdam, Larsen, and Laustsen [27, Lemma 2.2.3], the spectrum\nof a is contained in [\u22121/3, 1/3] \u222a [2/3, 4/3]. Let f : R \u2192 R the unique continuous\nfunction such that f (x) = 0 for each x \u2264 1/3, f (x) = 1/x for each x \u2265 2/3, and f is\naffine on [1/3, 2/3]. Observe that f (x)x = 0 for x \u2208 [\u22121/3, 1/3] and f (x)x = 1 for\nx \u2208 [2/3, 4/3], thus, using continuous function calculus, b := f (a)a is a projection.\nIt belongs to L as a \u2208 L, and ka \u2212 bk \u2264 1/3. Now ke \u2212 bk \u2264 2/3, so e \u223c b.\n\u0003\nSemiprimitive rings. It is known (cf. Jacobson [20, Theorem 1], Herstein [19,\nTheorem 1.2.3]) that the Jacobson radical J(R) of a ring (not necessarily unital) R\nis the largest two-sided ideal J of R such that (\u2200x \u2208 J)(\u2203s \u2208 R)(x + s \u2212 sx = 0).\nThis concept is left-right symmetric. A ring R is semiprimitive (semi-simple in\nJacobson [20, Section 2] or Herstein [19, page 16], but we are using the seemingly\nmore common terminology) if J(R) = {0}. Not every exchange ring is semiprimitive\n(consider the upper triangular matrices over a field, cf. Example 9.3).\nThe following is contained in Jacobson [20, Theorem 8].\nProposition 4.6. Every regular ring is semiprimitive.\nThe following is contained in Dixmier [8, Th\u00e9or\u00e8me 2.9.7].\nProposition 4.7. Every C*-algebra is semiprimitive.\n5. Exchange rings\nExchange rings have been first defined in the unital case in Warfield [30], then\nin the general case by Ara [1]. A ring R is an exchange ring if for all x \u2208 R, there\nare an idempotent e \u2208 R and r, s \u2208 R such that e = rx = x + s \u2212 sx. This condition\nis left-right symmetric. Not every exchange ring is a two-sided ideal in a unital\nexchange ring, see [1, Example 4, page 412]. A ring R is (von Neumann) regular\nif for all x \u2208 R, there exists y \u2208 R such that xyx = x. Every regular ring is an\nexchange ring, and the converse fails (cf. Example 9.3).\nThe following result is established in the unital case in Ara, Goodearl, O'Meara,\nand Pardo [3, Theorem 7.2], and then extended to the non-unital case in Ara [1,\nTheorem 3.8].\nProposition 5.1. A C*-algebra has real rank 0 iff it is an exchange ring.\n\n\f10\n\nF. WEHRUNG\n\nThe following is contained in Proposition 1.3 and Theorem 1.4 in Ara [1].\nLemma 5.2. The following statements hold, for any exchange ring R.\n(i) eRe is an exchange ring, for any idempotent e \u2208 R.\n(ii) Mn (R) is an exchange ring, for any positive integer n.\nIt is well-known that Lemma 5.2 extends to C*-algebras of real rank 0 (cf. Corollary 2.8 and Theorem 2.10 in Brown and Pedersen [7]).\nThe following result is proved in [1, Proposition 1.5].\nProposition 5.3. The monoid V(R) has refinement, for every exchange ring R.\nThe first part of the following result is proved in Ara [1, Theorem 2.2]. The\nsecond part is proved, in the unital case, in Ara, Goodearl, O'Meara, and Pardo [3,\nProposition 1.4]. The proof can be trivially extended to the non-unital case, by\nusing Lemma 5.2.\nProposition 5.4. Let I be a two-sided ideal in a ring R. Then R is an exchange\nring iff I and R/I are both exchange rings and idempotents can be lifted modulo I.\nFurthermore, if R is an exchange ring, then the canonical homomorphism V(R) \u2192\nV(R/I) is surjective, and it induces an isomorphism V(R)/ V(I) \u2192 V(R/I).\nIn the statement of Proposition 5.4, V(I) is identified with its image in V(R),\nwhich is an o-ideal of V(R). The quotient V(R)/ V(I) is defined in (3.1) and the\ncomment following.\nFrom now on we shall denote by Reg (resp., Exch) the category of all regular\nrings (resp., exchange rings) with ring homomorphisms.\n6. Weakly V-semiprimitive rings; an unliftable diagram\nDefinition 6.1. Elements \u03b1 and \u03b2 in a conical commutative monoid M are orthogonal, in notation \u03b1 \u22a5 \u03b2, if the following statement holds:\n\u0001\n(\u2200n \u2208 N)(\u2200\u03b3 \u2208 M ) (\u03b3 \u2264 n\u03b1 and \u03b3 \u2264 n\u03b2) \u21d2 \u03b3 = 0 .\nEquivalently, the o-ideals generated by \u03b1 and \u03b2, respectively, meet in {0}.\n\nLemma 6.2. Let R be an exchange ring, let a, b \u2208 I\u221e (R) with [a]R \u22a5 [b]R , and\ndenote by A and B the two-sided ideals of R generated by the entries of a and b,\nrespectively. Then A \u2229 B is contained in J(R).\nProof. Set I := A \u2229 B. It follows from Lemma 4.3 that for each e \u2208 I\u221e (I), there\nexists n \u2208 N such that [e] \u2264 n[a] and [e] \u2264 n[b]. As [a] \u22a5 [b], it follows that e = 0.\nHence V(I) = {0}. As I is an exchange ring without nonzero idempotents, it must\nbe contained in J(R).\n\u0003\nDefinition 6.3. A ring R is weakly V-semiprimitive if for all a, b \u2208 I\u221e (R), the\nrelation [a]R \u22a5 [b]R implies that ab \u2208 J(M\u221e (R)).\nAs an immediate consequence of Lemma 6.2, we record the following.\nProposition 6.4.

Hence there exists x \u2208 M\u221e (R) such that as(a)+x\u2212as(a)x = 0.\nBy applying h to each side of this equation and observing that a2 = a while h\u25e6s = h,\nwe obtain that h(a) + h(x) \u2212 h(a)h(x) = 0, thus, multiplying this equation on the\nleft by h(a), we get h(a) = 0. Therefore,\n1 = h(1, 0) = (h \u25e6 \u03b7R )([a]R ) = (\u03b7S \u25e6 V(h))([a]R ) = \u03b7S ([h(a)]S ) = 0\na contradiction.\n\nin Z+ ,\n\u0003\n\nCorollary 6.6.

Denote by Semb\ngrp (1) the category of all simplicial groups with\norder-unit with normalized positive group embeddings. Then there is no functor\n\u223c\n\u0393 : Semb\ngrp (1) \u2192 AF such that K0 \u25e6 \u0393 = id.\nOutline of proof. We shall first invoke some ideas from universal algebra and lattice\ntheory (cf. McKenzie, McNulty, and Taylor [22] for background). A bounded lattice\nis a lattice with smallest element and largest element (usually denoted by 0 and 1,\nrespectively). A variety of bounded lattices is the class of all bounded lattices that\nsatisfy a given set of identities, written in the language (\u2228, \u2227, 0, 1). For a variety V\nof bounded lattices and a set X, we denote by FV (X) the free object on X within\nthe variety V. We shall denote by M3 the lattice of length two with three atoms (cf.\nFigure 7.1) and by M3 the variety that it generates. As M3 is finite, the variety M3\n\nFigure 7.1. The lattice M3\nis locally finite, that is, FM3 (X) is finite whenever X is finite (this is a classical\nargument of universal algebra, see, for example, the proof of McKenzie, McNulty,\nand Taylor [22, Lemma 4.98]). Furthermore,\n(7.1)\nFM3 (X) = lim (FM3 (Y ) | Y \u2286 X finite) ,\n\u2212\u2192\nwith canonical transition maps and limiting maps, for any set X.\nWe proceed by invoking a lattice-theoretical tool. The dimension monoid Dim L\nof a lattice L, defined in Wehrung [32, Definition 1.1], is always a conical commutative monoid; furthermore, the assignment L 7\u2192 Dim L extends to a functor. As\nin [32], we define K0 (L) as the (preordered) Grothendieck group of Dim L.\nNow fix any set X with at least \u05d02 elements. By [32, Corollary 10.30], there is no\nregular ring R such that Dim FM3 (X) \u223c\n= V(R). Furthermore, as the Dim functor\npreserves direct limits (cf. [32, Proposition 1.4]), it follows from (7.1) that\nDim FM3 (X) = lim (Dim FM3 (Y ) | Y \u2282 X finite) ,\n\u2212\u2192\n\n(7.2)\n\nand thus\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n(7.3)\nK0 FM3 (X) = lim K0 FM3 (Y ) | Y \u2282 X finite .\n\u2212\u2192\nFor each finite Y \u2282 X, the lattice FM3 (Y ) is finite modular, thus its dimension\nmonoid Dim FM3 (Y ) is a finitely generated simplicial monoid (cf. [32, Proposi\u0001\ntion 5.5]); in particular, it embeds into its Grothendieck group K0 FM3 (X) . Furthermore, FM\n\u0001 3 (Y ) is a retract of FM3 (X)\u0001(send every element of X \\ Y to 0), thus\nK0 FM3 (Y ) is a retract of K0 FM3 (X) . Finally, all the transition morphisms\nin (7.2) are trivially seen to preserve the canonical order-units (namely, using the\nnotation of [32], \u2206(0, 1)). Therefore, the direct limit in (7.3) is, in fact, a direct\n\n\fLIFTING DEFECTS IN NONSTABLE K0 -THEORY\n\n13\n\nunion of dimension groups with order-unit. Hence, by assumption on \u0393, we can\ndefine an AF C*-algebra as a C*-direct limit,\n\u0001\n\u0001\nfor C*-algebras .\n(7.4)\nA := lim \u0393 K0 FM3 (Y ) | Y \u2282 X finite\n\u2212\u2192\nLet R be a dense locally matricial algebra (over C) in A. Then K0 (R) \u223c\n= K0 (A).\nFurthermore, as the functor K0 preserves C*-direct limits and K0 \u25e6 \u0393 \u223c\n= id, it follows\nfrom (7.4) that\n\u0001\n\u0001\nin the category of dimension groups ,\nK0 (A) = lim K0 FM3 (Y ) | Y \u2282 X finite\n\u2212\u2192\n\u0001\nso K0 (A) \u223c\n= Dim FM3 (X). However, as R is von Neu= K0 FM3 (X) , and so V(R) \u223c\nmann regular, this is a contradiction.\n\u0003\nThe proof of Proposition 7.1 may feel quite outlandish to a number of readers:\nwhile its statement is, essentially, combinatorial, its proof involves the counterexample of cardinality \u05d02 introduced in [31]. Extracting the gist of that proof will\nlead us to the proof of Theorem 10.1, which is, to a large extent, a finitary result,\ninvolving neither transfinite cardinals, nor universal algebra, nor lattice theory. It\nwill also extend Proposition 7.1 to C*-algebras of real rank 0.\n8. The category of premeasured rings\nDefinition 8.1. Let M be a conical commutative monoid and let R be a ring. An\nM -valued premeasure on R is a map \u03bc : I\u221e (R) \u2192 M such that\n(M0) \u03bc(0) = 0;\n(M1) \u03bc(a + b) = \u03bc(a) + \u03bc(b), for all orthogonal idempotents a, b \u2208 I\u221e (R);\n(M2) a \u223c b implies that \u03bc(a) = \u03bc(b), for all a, b \u2208 I\u221e (R). (Recall that \u223c stands\nfor Murray-von Neumann equivalence, see Section 4.)\nWe say that the premeasure \u03bc is a measure if it satisfies the condition\n(M0+ ) \u03bc(e) = 0 iff e = 0, for each e \u2208 I\u221e (R).\nWe say that the premeasure \u03bc is a V-premeasure if it satisfies the following Vcondition:\n(M3) For all c \u2208 I\u221e (R) and all \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 M such that \u03bc(c) = \u03b1 + \u03b2, there are\northogonal idempotent a, b \u2208 I\u221e (R) such that c = a + b, \u03bc(a) = \u03b1, and\n\u03bc(b) = \u03b2.\nWe say that \u03bc is a V-measure if it is both a measure and a V-premeasure.\nWe shall use the notation M = M\u03bc (the codomain of \u03bc).\nA fundamental example of a V-measure is the following.\nExample 8.2. Let R be a ring. Then the assignment \u03c4R : I\u221e (R) \u2192 V(R), e 7\u2192 [e]R\nis a measure on R. Due to Lemma 4.2, \u03c4R is actually a V-measure. We call it the\ncanonical V-measure on R.\nDefinition 8.3. Let M and N be conical commutative monoids. A homomorphism\nf : M \u2192 N is a pre-V-homomorphism if whenever a, b \u2208 N and c \u2208 M with\nf (c) = a + b, there are x, y \u2208 M such that c = x + y, f (x) = a, and f (y) = b.\nIf, in addition, f \u22121 {0N } = 0M , then we say that f is a V-homomorphism (cf.\nDobbertin [9, Definition 1.2]).\nThe following result relates the definition of a measure given above, the canonical\nV-measure, and the notion of V-homomorphism. It expresses the universality of \u03c4R\nas a premeasure on R, and its proof is a straightforward exercise.\n\n\f14\n\nF. WEHRUNG\n\nProposition 8.4. Let R be a ring, let M be a conical commutative monoid, and\nlet \u03bc be an M -valued premeasure on R. Then there exists a unique monoid homomorphism \u03bc : V(R) \u2192 M such that \u03bc = \u03bc \u25e6 \u03c4R . Furthermore,\n(i) \u03bc is a measure iff \u03bc\u22121 {0} = {0};\n(ii) \u03bc is a V-premeasure iff \u03bc is a pre-V-homomorphism.\nDefinition 8.5. For a category R of rings and ring homomorphisms, we shall\ndenote by Rpmeas the category where the objects (premeasured rings) are the pairs\n(R, \u03bc), where \u03bc is a premeasure on the ring R \u2208 R (with values in some conical\ncommutative monoid), and, for objects (R, \u03bc) and (S, \u03bd), a morphism from (R, \u03bc)\nto (S, \u03bd) is a pair (f, f \u0303), where f : R \u2192 S is a ring homomorphism, f \u0303: M\u03bc \u2192 M\u03bd is\na monoid homomorphism, and \u03bd \u25e6 I\u221e (f ) = f \u0303 \u25e6 \u03bc (cf. Figure 8.1).

A morphism from (R, \u03bc) to (S, \u03bd)\nof morphisms is defined componentwise (i.e., (f, f \u0303) \u25e6 (g, g\u0303) = (f \u25e6 g, f \u0303 \u25e6 g\u0303)).\nWe define similarly Rmeas , RVpmeas , RVmeas , using measures, V-premeasures,\nand V-measures, respectively, instead of premeasures.\nNext, we introduce two functors: one to Ringpmeas , and one from Ringpmeas .\nDefinition 8.6. The canonical functor \u03c4 : Ring \u2192 Ringpmeas is defined by \u03c4 (R) :=\n(R, \u03c4R ) (cf. Example 8.2) and \u03c4 (f ) := (f, V(f )), for any rings R and S and any\nring homomorphism f : R \u2192 S.\nThe projection functor \u03a0 : Ringpmeas \u2192 CMon is defined by \u03a0(R, \u03bc) := M\u03bc\nand \u03a0(f, f \u0303) := f \u0303, for any premeasured rings (R, \u03bc) and (S, \u03bd) and any morphism\n(f, f \u0303) : (R, \u03bc) \u2192 (S, \u03bd).\nRemark 8.7. It is trivial that V = \u03a0 \u25e6 \u03c4 . In particular, if a diagram can be lifted\nby rings with respect to the functor V, then it can be lifted by premeasured rings\nwith respect to the functor \u03a0.\nFrom now on, we shall often omit the second coordinate f \u0303 in a morphism (f, f \u0303)\nfrom Ringpmeas , thus simply writing f : (R, \u03bc) \u2192 (S, \u03bd) and specifying what is f \u0303\nin case needed.\nLemma 8.8. The category Exchmeas is a reflective subcategory of Exchpmeas , with\nreflector \u0398r : Exchpmeas \u2192 Exchmeas satisfying \u03a0 \u25e6 \u0398r = \u03a0. Furthermore,\n(i) \u0398r sends surjective premeasures to surjective measures;\n(ii) \u0398r sends V-premeasures to V-measures;\n(iii) \u0398r sends regular rings to regular rings.\nProof. Let \u03bc be a premeasure, with values in a conical commutative monoid M ,\non an exchange ring R, and denote by \u03bc : V(R) \u2192 M the canonical monoid homomorphism. Denote by I the two-sided ideal of R generated by the entries of all\n\n\fLIFTING DEFECTS IN NONSTABLE K0 -THEORY\n\n15\n\nx \u2208 I\u221e (R) such that \u03bc(x) = 0. By Lemma 4.3 together with the conicality of M ,\n\u03bc(e) = 0 for each e \u2208 I\u221e (I); so \u03bc\u21beV(I) = 0. Therefore, denoting by \u03c1 : V(R) \u0589\nV(R)/ V(I) the canonical projection, there exists a unique monoid homomorphism\n\u03bc\u0303 : V(R)/ V(I) \u2192 M such that \u03bc = \u03bc\u0303 \u25e6 \u03c1. Then R\u2217 := R/I is an exchange ring,\nwhile, composing \u03bc\u0303 with the canonical isomorphism V(R/I) \u223c\n= V(R)/ V(I) (cf.\nProposition 5.4) and using the fact that idempotents can be lifted modulo I, we\nobtain a (necessarily unique) monoid homomorphism \u03bc\u2217 : V(R/I) \u2192 M such that\n\u03bc\u2217 ([e + M\u221e (I)]R/I ) = \u03bc(e) ,\n\nfor each e \u2208 I\u221e (R) .\n\u2217\n\nThe map \u03bc\u2217 defined by the rule \u03bc\u2217 (e) := \u03bc ([e]R\u2217 ) for each e \u2208 I\u221e (R\u2217 ) is an\nM -valued premeasure on R\u2217 , and\n\u03bc\u2217 (e + M\u221e (I)) = \u03bc(e) ,\n\nfor each e \u2208 I\u221e (R) .\n\n(8.1)\n\nFor each e \u2208 I\u221e (R) such that \u03bc\u2217 (e + M\u221e (I)) = 0, that is, \u03bc(e) = 0, it follows from\nthe definition of I that e \u2208 M\u221e (I). Therefore, \u03bc\u2217 is an M -valued measure on R\u2217 .\nClaim. (R\u2217 , \u03bc\u2217 ) is the Exchmeas -reflection of (R, \u03bc), with Exchmeas -reflection\nmorphism the canonical projection \u03c0 : R \u0589 R\u2217 with \u03c0\u0303 := idM .\nProof of Claim. We must prove that for every measured exchange ring (S, \u03bd) and\nevery morphism \u03c6 : (R, \u03bc) \u2192 (S, \u03bd), there exists a unique morphism\n\u03c6\u2217 : (R\u2217 , \u03bc\u2217 ) \u2192 (S, \u03bd) such that \u03c6 = \u03c6\u2217 \u25e6 \u03c0. For each x \u2208 I, \u03bd(\u03c6(x)) = \u03c6\u0303(\u03bc(x)) =\n\u03c6\u0303(0) = 0, thus, as \u03bd is a measure, \u03c6(x) = 0. It follows that there exists a unique\nring homomorphism \u03c6\u2217 : R\u2217 \u2192 S such that \u03c6 = \u03c6\u2217 \u25e6 \u03c0. Setting \u03c6 \u0303\u2217 := \u03c6\u0303, we obtain\nthat \u03c6 is as desired.\n\u0003 Claim.\nDenote by \u0398r : (R, \u03bc) 7\u2192 (R\u2217 , \u03bc\u2217 ) the Exchmeas -reflection functor. As \u03bc and \u03bc\u2217\nhave the same codomain and \u03c6 \u0303\u2217 := \u03c6\u0303 in the proof of the Claim above, \u03a0 \u25e6 \u0398r = \u0398r\nand the surjectivity of \u03bc implies the one of \u03bc\u2217 . If \u03bc is a V-premeasure, then, as\nidempotents can be lifted modulo I, so is \u03bc\u2217 (cf. (8.1)). Finally, if R is a regular\nring, then R\u2217 = R/I is also regular.\n\u0003\nThe following analogue of Lemma 8.8 for C*-algebras of real rank 0 is valid.\nLemma 8.9. The category RR0 meas is a reflective subcategory of RR0 pmeas , with\nreflector \u0398a : RR0 pmeas \u2192 RR0 meas satisfying \u03a0 \u25e6 \u0398a = \u03a0. Furthermore,\n(i) \u0398a sends surjective premeasures to surjective measures;\n(ii) \u0398a sends V-premeasures to V-measures.\nProof. Using Proposition 5.1, the proof is almost identical to the one of Lemma 8.8.\nThe main difference is the need to replace the ideal I of R by its topological closure I\n(so R/I is still a C*-algebra, necessarily of real rank 0, see Brown and Pedersen [7,\nTheorem 3.14]). We need to prove that \u03bc(x) = 0 for each projection x of I. By\nLemma 4.5, x is equivalent to a projection y of I. By the proof of Lemma 8.8,\n\u03bc(y) = 0; thus \u03bc(x) = 0. Now the reflection morphism \u0398a : RR0 pmeas \u2192 RR0 meas\nis defined by \u0398a (R, \u03bc) := (R\u2217 , \u03bc\u2217 ), where this time\n\u03bc\u2217 (e + M\u221e (I)) = \u03bc(e) ,\n\nfor each e \u2208 I\u221e (R) ,\n\n(8.2)\n\nwhile \u03c0 : R \u0589 R/I is the canonical projection and \u03c0\u0303 = idM . The rest of the proof\nruns as the one of Lemma 8.8.\n\u0003\n\n\f16\n\nF. WEHRUNG\n\n9. V-semiprimitive rings\nThe following definition introduces a strengthening of the weakly V-semiprimitive\nrings introduced in Definition 6.3.\nDefinition 9.1. A ring R is V-semiprimitive if for all a, b \u2208 I\u221e (R), [a]R \u22a5 [b]R\nin V(R) implies that ab = 0.\nIf V(R) is totally ordered with respect to its algebraic preordering, then R is\nV-semiprimitive. In particular, this holds if V(R) \u223c\n= Z+ . This isomorphism occurs in case R is a principal ideal domain. Due to the Quillen-Suslin Theorem,\nit also holds in case R is a polynomial ring over a field. Another important class\nof V-semiprimitive rings, which also explains the terminology, is provided by the\nfollowing result.\nProposition 9.2. Every semiprimitive exchange ring is V-semiprimitive.\nWe emphasize here that the rings in question are not necessarily unital.\nProof. Let R be a semiprimitive exchange ring and let a, b \u2208 I\u221e (R) such that\n[a] \u22a5 [b] in V(R). Denoting by A and B the two-sided ideals of R generated by the\nentries of a and b, respectively, it follows from Lemma 6.2 that A \u2229 B is contained\nin J(R), thus, by assumption, A \u2229 B = {0}, so ab = 0.\n\u0003\nThe following two examples show that none of the assumptions of semiprimitivity\nand exchange property can be dispensed with in the statement of Proposition 9.2.\nExample 9.3. Let K be a field (any unital exchange ring would do). Then the\nring R of all upper triangular 2\u00d72 matrices over K is an exchange\n\u0012\n\u0013 ring, but\u0012it is not\n\u0013\n1 1\n0 0\nV-semiprimitive. To show the latter statement, set a :=\nand b :=\n.\n0 0\n0 1\nObserve that V(R) \u223c\n[a] = (1, 0)\n= Z+ \u00d7 Z+ , and once the two monoids\u0012are identified,\n\u0013\n0 1\nwhile [b] = (0, 1). In particular, [a] \u22a5 [b], although ab =\nis nonzero.\n0 0\nExample 9.4. We denote by C(X, A) the C*-algebra of all A-valued continuous\nfunctions on a topological space X, for any C*-algebra A. We denote by [0, 1] the\nunit interval of R and we set\nD := {x \u2208 C([0, 1], M2 (C)) | x(0) is a diagonal matrix} .\nThis type of construction appears in Su [28, Section 1.2]. The ring D is a key\ningredient in the main construction in Section 12. Then D is a semiprimitive unital\nring (because it is a unital C*-algebra, cf. Proposition 4.7). However, D is not\nV-semiprimitive. Indeed, denoting by z : [0, 1] \u0592\u2192 C the inclusion map and setting\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 z\n0 0\na :=\nand b :=\n,\n0 0\n0 1\n\u0012\n\u0013\n0 z\nthen a and b are both idempotent and ab =\nis nonzero. However, we prove\n0 0\nin Section 12 that V(D) \u223c\n= Z+ \u00d7 Z+ , via an isomorphism that is easily seen to\nsend [a] to (1, 0) and b to (0, 1). In particular, [a] \u22a5 [b] in V(D). Therefore, D is\nnot V-semiprimitive.\n\n\fLIFTING DEFECTS IN NONSTABLE K0 -THEORY\n\n17\n\nLemma 9.5. Let R be a V-semiprimitive ring, let M be a conical commutative\nmonoid, and let \u03bc : I\u221e (R) \u2192 M be a measure. Let a, b, e \u2208 I\u221e (R) with a \u2264 e and\nb \u2264 e while \u03bc(a) \u22a5 \u03bc(e \u2212 b) and \u03bc(b) \u22a5 \u03bc(e \u2212 a) in M . Then a = b.\nProof. Denote by \u03bc : V(R) \u2192 M the unique V-homomorphism such that \u03bc(x) =\n\u03bc([x]) for each x \u2208 I\u221e (R) (cf. Proposition 8.4). We claim that [a] \u22a5 [e \u2212 b] in V(R).\nIndeed, otherwise there would exist a nonzero x \u2208 I\u221e (R) such that [x] \u2264 [a] and\n[x] \u2264 [e \u2212 b]. By applying \u03bc to those inequalities, we obtain \u03bc(x) \u2264 \u03bc(a) and\n\u03bc(x) \u2264 \u03bc(e \u2212 b), a contradiction as \u03bc(x) 6= 0 and \u03bc(a) \u22a5 \u03bc(e \u2212 b), and thus proving\nour claim. As R is V-semiprimitive, it follows that a(e \u2212 b) = (e \u2212 b)a = 0, thus, as\na \u2264 e, we get that a = ab = ba. By symmetry, a = ab = ba = b.\n\u0003\n10.

The algebras A, D, and M2 (A) have both real rank and stable\nrank equal to 1.\n\n\fLIFTING DEFECTS IN NONSTABLE K0 -THEORY\n\n25\n\nProof. It follows from Brown and Pedersen [7, Proposition 1.1] that A = C([0, 1], C)\nhas real rank 1, while, by Rieffel [26, Proposition 1.7], A has stable rank 1. By\nRieffel [26, Theorem 3.3], it follows that M2 (A) has also stable rank 1. By Brown\nand Pedersen [7, Proposition 1.2], it follows that M2 (A) has real rank 1 as well.\nAs A has stable rank 1, the argument of the second part of the proof of [26,\nTheorem 3.3] shows easily that D has stable rank 1. By [7, Proposition 1.2], it\nfollows that the real rank of D is either 0 or 1. As A is isomorphic to a hereditary\nsubalgebra of D, it follows from [7, Corollary 2.8] that D has real rank 1.\n\u0003\n(n)\n\nFor each idempotent e \u2208 DX , the trace tr(e(x)) is a nonnegative integer for\neach x \u2208 X. As the map tr \u25e6 e is continuous on X, it follows that if X is connected\n(which will always be the case throughout this section), then the value of tr(e(x)),\nfor x \u2208 X, is constant. We shall denote this value by tr(e) and call it the trace of e.\nObserve that the trace of e is equal to the rank of e(x), for each x \u2208 X.\nThe following result is contained in Examples 1.4.2 and 5.1.3(c) of Blackadar [6].\nLemma 12.2. Let a, b \u2208 R with a \u2264 b. Then V(C([a, b], C)) \u223c\n= Z+ . Furthermore, for any positive integer n, two idempotent elements of Mn (C([a, b], C)) are\nequivalent iff they have the same trace.\n(n)\n\nLemma 12.3. Let e \u2208 D[0,1] be a projection. Then e and e(0) are unitarily equiv(n)\n\nalent in D[0,1] .\nProof. Set e := e(0). The common value r := tr(e) = tr(e) is an integer with\n0 \u2264 r \u2264 2n. As e is continuous at 0, there is \u03b5 \u2208 (0, 1] such that ke(t) \u2212 e(0)k \u2264 1/2\n(n)\nfor each t \u2208 [0, \u03b5].

Back to the transfinite: an exchange ring of cardinality \u05d03\nOur first non-lifting result, Proposition 7.1, started with a counterexample of\ncardinality \u05d02 . We applied the combinatorial core of that result in Theorem 10.1.\nNow the cycle swings back on itself: we shall get further negative representation results, algebraically stronger than those that we used in order to get Proposition 7.1,\nnow in cardinality \u05d03 (the present form of Theorem 10.1 would not yield \u05d02 ).\nThroughout\n\u0012 this section we fix\u0013a field K, and we denote by K(t)(0) (cf. (11.2))\nK(t)(0) tK(t)(0)\nand CK :=\n(cf. (11.3)) the K-algebras introduced in the\ntK(t)(0) K(t)(0)\nproof of Theorem 11.2.

As, by Proposition 5.3, V(R) is a (conical) refinement monoid, it follows\nfrom Lemma 4.4 that V(R) is the positive cone of a dimension group in which [1R ]\nhas index at most two. In particular, by Yu [33, Theorem 9], R has stable rank 1.\n\n\f28\n\nF. WEHRUNG\n\nNow recall that CMon denotes the category of all conical commutative monoids\nwith monoid homomorphisms (cf. Definition 3.1). We shall also define the subcategory CMon\u21d2 with the same objects but where the morphisms are the preV-homomorphisms (cf. Definition 8.3), and the full subcategory CMon6\u05d00 of all\ncountable (i.e., at most countable) conical commutative monoids.\nDenote by \u03a6 : AK \u2192 CMon the functor V (i.e., R 7\u2192 V(R), f 7\u2192 V(f )).\nWe introduce in Definition 3.8.1 and Definition 3.8.2 of Gillibert and Wehrung [13]\nattributes of certain collections of categories and functors, called left larderhood and\nright larderhood. We shall use the notation used in these two definitions, yet trying\nto spell out in detail the verifications to be performed, and we shall start with the\n(traditionally easier) left part.\nLemma 13.1. The quadruple (AK , CMon, CMon\u21d2 , \u03a6) is a left larder.\nProof. We check one after another the items defining left larderhood.\n\u2022 (CLOS(AK )) and (PROD(AK )): by definition, AK is closed under direct\nlimits and finite products.\n\u2022 (CONT(\u03a6)): it is well-known that the functor V preserves direct limits.\n\u2022 (PROJ(\u03a6, CMon\u21d2 )): we must check that V(f ) is a double arrow (i.e.,\na pre-V-homomorphism), for each morphism f : R \u2192 S in AK which is\na direct limit (in the category of all arrows of AK ) f = limj\u2208J fj of\n\u2212\u2192\nprojections fj : Rj \u00d7 Sj \u0589 Rj , (x, y) 7\u2192 x, for each j \u2208 J (J is a directed\npartially ordered set). As V(Rj \u00d7 Sj ) \u223c\n= V(Rj ) \u00d7 V(Sj ), with V(fj ) the\ncanonical projection V(Rj ) \u00d7 V(Sj ) \u0589 V(Rj ), V(fj ) is obviously a preV-homomorphism. As the class of pre-V-homomorphisms is easily seen to\nbe closed under direct limits (within the category of all arrows of CMon)\nand the functor V preserves direct limits, it follows that V(f ) is a pre-Vhomomorphism.\n\u0003\nIn order to fill the \"right larder\" part, we need, for C*-algebras of real rank 0,\n\u2022 RR0 , the category of all C*-algebras of real rank 0 with C*-homomorphisms (cf.

The 6-uple (RR0 , RR0 sep , CMon, CMon6\u05d00 , CMon\u21d2 , \u03a8a ) is a\nright \u05d01 -larder.\nProof. The part (PRES\u05d01 (CMon6\u05d00 , \u03a8a )) involves the notion of a weakly \u05d01 -presented structure introduced in Gillibert and Wehrung [13, Definition 1.3.2]. It is,\nbasically, easy: every B \u2208 RR0 sep is separable, thus (cf. the Note on page 28 in\nBlackadar [6]) V(B) is countable, thus (cf. Gillibert and Wehrung [13, Proposition 4.2.3]) weakly \u05d01 -presented.\nThe part (LSr\u05d01 (B)), for a given B \u2208 RR0 , is less obvious. We are given a countable conical refinement monoid M and a pre-V-homomorphism \u03c8 : V(B) \u21d2 M ,\n\n\fLIFTING DEFECTS IN NONSTABLE K0 -THEORY\n\n29\n\ntogether with a sequence fn : Bn \u2192 B of unital C*-homomorphisms (the fn can\nbe assumed to be monomorphisms, but this will play no role here).

As B has real\nrank 0 and Y2k is countable, there exists Y2k+1 \u2208 F containing Y2k such that every\nself-adjoint element of Q[i] \u00d7 Y2k , viewed as a subset of the unitization of B, lies\nwithin 1/(k + 1) of some invertible self-adjoint element of the unitization of Y2k+1 .\nAs Y2k+1 and M are both countable and by the Claim above, there is Y2k+2 \u2208 F\ncontaining Y2k+1 such that for all c \u2208 I\u221e (Y2k+1 ) and \u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 M with \u03c8([c]B ) =\n\u03b1 + \u03b2, there are orthogonal idempotents a, b \u2208 I\u221e (Y2k+2 ) such that c = a + b while\n\u03c8([a]B ) = \u03b1 and \u03c8([b]B ) = \u03b2.\nS\nBy construction, the union Y := k\u2208Z+ Yk belongs to F and the closure Y has\nreal rank 0. Furthermore, it follows from (13.2) that every projection of M\u221e (Y )\nis equivalent to some projection in M\u221e (Y ); hence, by the construction of Y2k+2\nfrom Y2k+1 , it follows that \u03c8 \u25e6 V(eY ) is a pre-V-homomorphism. Furthermore,\nS\nS\nfrom n\u2208Z+ fn (Xn ) \u2286 Y0 \u2286 Y it follows that n\u2208Z+ fn (Bn ) \u2286 Y . Therefore,\nC := Y is as required.\n\u0003\nConsider again the set RK of exchange algebras defined in (13.1). As \u03a6(RK )\nis contained in CMon6\u05d00 , we obtain the following consequence of Lemmas 13.1\nand 13.2 together with the (obvious) [13, Proposition 3.8.3].\nLemma 13.3. The 8-uple (AK , RR0 , CMon, RK , RR0 sep , CMon\u21d2 , \u03a6, \u03a8a ) is an\n\u05d01 -larder.\n\n\f30\n\nF. WEHRUNG\n\nThe analogue of Lemma 13.2 for regular rings is the following.\nLemma 13.4. The 6-uple (Reg, Reg6\u05d00 , CMon, CMon6\u05d00 , CMon\u21d2 , \u03a8r ) is a\nright \u05d01 -larder.\nThe proof of Lemma 13.4 is similar, and actually slightly easier (because there\nis no topology involved) than the one of Lemma 13.2, thus we omit it.\nLemma 13.3 is modified in a similar fashion.\nLemma 13.5. The 8-uple (AK , Reg, CMon, RK , Reg6\u05d00 , CMon\u21d2 , \u03a6, \u03a8r ) is an\n\u05d01 -larder.\nNow everything is ready for the proof of the following result.\nTheorem 13.6. For any field K, there exists a unital exchange K-algebra RK that\nsatisfies the following properties:\n(i) RK has index of nilpotence 2 (thus stable rank 1).\n(ii) For every C*-algebra of real rank 0 (resp., for every regular ring) B, there\nis no surjective pre-V-homomorphism from V(B) onto V(RK ).\nIn particular, there is no C*-algebra of real rank 0 (resp., no regular ring) B such\nthat V(RK ) \u223c\n= V(B). Furthermore, RK can be constructed as the (unital ) direct\nlimit of a system of \u05d03 finite products of members of RK . In particular, if K is\ncountable (or, more generally, has at most \u05d03 elements), then card RK \u2264 \u05d03 .\nProof. We apply [13, Lemma 3.4.2], called there CLL, to the following data:\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\n\u03bb = \u03bc = \u05d01 ;\nP is the powerset lattice of the three-element set {0, 1, 2};\n~ is the commutative diagram of unital exchange K-algebras, given in\nA\n~ \u223c\n~ u . Observe that all objects of A\n~\nProposition 11.3, such that V1 A\n= D\nbelong to RK (cf. (13.1));\n\u2022 \u039b is one of the \u05d01 -larders given by either Lemma 13.3 or Lemma 13.5.\n~ involved in the statement of CLL, which will turn\nThe structure F(X) \u2297 A\nout to be the desired counterexample RK , is the same for both larders (it\n~ P , and X).\ndepends only of AK , A,\nIn order for the assumptions underlying CLL to be fulfilled, we need P to admit\nan \u05d01 -lifter (cf. [13, Definition 3.2.1]) (X, X) such that card X \u2264 \u05d03 . As P is\na finite lattice, it is a so-called almost join-semilattice (cf. [13, Definition 2.1.2]),\nthus, according to [13, Corollary 3.5.8], it is sufficient to prove that the relation\n(\u05d03 , <\u05d01 ) \u2740 P (cf. [12, Definition 3.1], also [13, Definition 3.5.1]) holds. According\nto the definition of the Kuratowski index kur(P ) given in [12, Definition 4.1], it\nsuffices to prove that kur(P ) \u2264 3. As P has exactly three join-irreducible elements,\nthis is a trivial consequence of [12, Proposition 4.2].\nThe statement of CLL involves a \"P -scaled Boolean algebra\", denoted there\nby F(X) (where (X, X) is the abovementioned \u05d01 -lifter), and the \"condensate\"\n~ A P -scaled Boolean algebra is a Boolean algebra endowed with a colF(X) \u2297 A.\nlection, indexed by P , of ideals, subjected to certain constraints. For our present\npurposes, neither the exact definition of a P -scaled Boolean algebra (cf. [13, Definition 2.2.3]), nor the exact descriptions of the constructions of F(X) (cf. [13,\n~ (cf. [13, Section 3.1]), will matter.\nLemma 2.6.5]) and F(X) \u2297 A\n\n\fLIFTING DEFECTS IN NONSTABLE K0 -THEORY\n\n31\n\n~ The statement that RK is a direct limit of finite prodWe set RK := F(X) \u2297 A.\nucts of members of RK , together with the cardinality bound on RK , are immediate\nconsequences of the following facts:\n\u2022 F(X) is a P -scaled Boolean algebra with at most \u05d03 elements.\n\u2022 Thus F(X) = limj\u2208I B j , for a directed poset I of cardinality \u05d03 and\n\u2212\u2192\n\"compact\" (i.e., here, finitely presented) P -scaled Boolean algebras B j\n(cf. [13, Proposition 2.4.6]).\n~ = lim (B j \u2297 A).\n~ This follows from [13, Proposition 3.1.4].\n\u2022 F(X) \u2297 A\n\u2212\u2192j\u2208I\n~ is a finite product of members of A.\n~ This follows from [13,\n\u2022 Each B j \u2297 A\nDefinition 3.1.1].\nSuppose that there exists a surjective pre-V-homomorphism \u03c7 : V(B) \u21d2 V(RK ),\nfor a C*-algebra B with real rank 0.

We thus obtain a diagram C\n~ \u223c\n~ But this\nV-premeasures on (unital) C*-algebras of real rank 0 such that \u03a0 C\n= D.\ncontradicts Corollary 10.4.\nThis completes the proof that RK is the desired counterexample for C*-algebras\nof real rank 0.\nWe also need to prove that there exists no surjective pre-V-homomorphism\n\u03c7 : V(B) \u21d2 V(RK ), for any regular ring B. The proof is similar to the one for\nC*-algebras of real rank 0. We need to use Lemmas 13.4 and 13.5 instead of Lemmas 13.2 and 13.3, and Corollary 10.5 instead of Corollary 10.4.\n\u0003\n14. An \u05d03 -separable C*-algebra\nFor an infinite cardinal \u03ba, we say that a C*-algebra is \u03ba-separable if it has a\ndense subset of cardinality at most \u03ba. In particular, \u05d00 -separable means separable.\nWe claim that what we did in Section 13, using the diagram of exchange rings\nconstructed in Section 11, can be done for C*-algebras, using the diagram of C*algebras constructed in Section 12.\nConsider again the C*-algebra D used in Example 9.4 and Section 12, and set\nA := {C} \u222a {D} \u222a {M2 (C([0, 1), C))} .\n\n(14.1)\n\nThe relevant analogue of Theorem 13.6 is the following.\nTheorem 14.1. There exists an \u05d03 -separable unital C*-algebra E that satisfies the\nfollowing properties.\n(i) E has index of nilpotence 2, and real rank and stable rank both equal to 1.\n(ii) (V(E), [1E ]) is the positive cone of a dimension group with order-unit of\nindex two.\n(iii) For every C*-algebra of real rank 0 (resp., every regular ring) B, there\nexists no surjective pre-V-homomorphism from V(B) onto V(E).\n\n\f32\n\nF. WEHRUNG\n\nIn particular, there is no C*-algebra of real rank 0 (resp., no regular ring) B such\nthat V(E) \u223c\n= V(B). Furthermore, E can be constructed as the (unital ) C*-direct\nlimit of a system of \u05d03 finite products of members of A.\nWhile stating that the nonstable K0 -theory of C*-algebras is contained neither\nin the one of regular rings nor in the one of C*-algebras of real rank 0 is no big deal\n(for V(A) may not have refinement, even for a unital C*-algebra A, cf. Blackadar\n[6, Example 5.1.3(e)]), Theorem 14.1 states this fact even for those C*-algebras\nwhose nonstable K0 -theory is a refinement monoid, which is far more difficult.\nThe proof of Theorem 14.1 is very similar to the one of Theorem 13.6, now getting\n~ from Proposition 12.6 instead of Proposition 11.3. The\nthe P -indexed diagram A\nright larder part requires no change. The left larder part needs to be modified in\nthe obvious way: the category AK needs to be replaced by the closure A of A\nunder finite products and C*-direct limits. As the functor V preserves finite direct\nproducts and C*-direct limits, (V(X), [1X ]) is a refinement monoid with orderunit of index at most two, for each X \u2208 A. As in the proof of Lemma 13.1, the\nquadruple (A, CMon, CMon\u21d2 , \u03a6) is a left larder. As every member of A has real\nrank either 0 or 1 while it has stable rank 1 (cf. Proposition 12.1), this is also the\ncase for every direct limit of finite products of members of A, in particular for the\n~ The remaining changes that need to be applied to the\ncondensate E := F(X) \u2297 A.\nproof of Theorem 13.6 are trivial.\n15. Open problems\nProblem 1. Does any of the classes {M | (\u2203R regular ring)(M \u223c\n= V(R))} and\n{M | (\u2203A C*-algebra of real rank 0)(M \u223c\n= V(A))} contain the other? And on positive cones of dimension groups?\nThe \"combinatorial\" side of the second part of Problem 1 reads as follows.\nProblem 2. Are there finite, lattice-indexed commutative diagrams of simplicial\nmonoids that can be lifted, with respect to the functor V, by diagrams in one of\nthe classes Reg and RR0 but not the other?\nThe results and methods of Elliott [11] and Goodearl and Handelman [15] imply\nthat the nonstable K-theories of regular rings and of C*-algebras of real rank 0\n(and also of AF C*-algebras) agree on dimension groups of cardinality at most \u05d01 .\nOur next question is about the remaining cardinality gap \u05d02 .\nProblem 3. Can the bound \u05d03 be improved to \u05d02 in Theorems 13.6 and 14.1?\nAs to the non-representability by regular rings, it looks plausible that a positive\nsolution to Problem 3 would follow from the methods of Wehrung [31]. In that\npaper, the fact that the principal right ideals in a regular ring form a lattice is\ncrucial. As the analogous result for C*-algebras of real rank 0 does not hold, it\nsounds unlikely that the methods of [31] are ready to help finding a solution to\nProblem 3 for those algebras. On the other hand, it is plausible that one may be\nable to use special functors, similar to those involved in Gillibert and Wehrung\n[13, Chapter 5] (which is pure lattice theory!), for which a suitable analogue of\nTheorem 10.1 would remain valid.\nEvery conical commutative monoid with order-unit is isomorphic to V1 (R) for\nsome unital hereditary ring R: this is proved in Theorems 6.2 and 6.4 of Bergman [4]\n\n\fLIFTING DEFECTS IN NONSTABLE K0 -THEORY\n\n33\n\nfor the finitely generated case, and in Bergman and Dicks [5, page 315] for the general case. The general, non-unital case is proved in Ara and Goodearl [2, Proposition 4.4]. In light of this result, the following problem is natural.\nProblem 4.
