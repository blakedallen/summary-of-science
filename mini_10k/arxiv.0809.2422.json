It was proved [2] that two Kerr black holes with positive Komar\nmasses cannot be in equilibrium due to balance of the gravitational and spin\u2013spin forces\nwithout a supporting strut in between, the latter preventing the black holes from falling\nonto each other. In view of this it would be advantageous to identify a particular exact\nsolution for the simplest binary system of Kerr black holes separated by a massless strut\nbecause such a solution would be free of pathological regions involving closed time\u2013like curves\nand could probably find interesting applications in the black hole physics. It is worthwhile\nmentioning that in the paper [3] an attempt was made to construct the simplest solution for a\npair of stationary black holes by considering the corotating identical constituents. However,\nthe constituents in the solution [3] are separated by a special massive region which makes\nany accurate analysis of the thermodynamical properties of that specific binary system\nhardly possible. Fortunately, the axis condition is satisfied automatically in the case of\nanother known exact solution constructed in [4] and describing (in the absence of the charge\nparameter q) a binary system of counter\u2013rotating identical Kerr black holes or hyperextreme\nobjects. On the symmetry axis the Ernst complex potential E [5] of the vacuum specialization\nof the Bret\u00f3n\u2013Manko solution has the form\nE(\u03c1 = 0, z) := e(z) =\n\n(z \u2212 k \u2032 \u2212 m\u2032 \u2212 ia\u2032 )(z + k \u2032 \u2212 m\u2032 + ia\u2032 )\n,\n(z \u2212 k \u2032 + m\u2032 \u2212 ia\u2032 )(z + k \u2032 + m\u2032 + ia\u2032 )\n\n(1)\n\nthe parameters m\u2032 , a\u2032 and k \u2032 being associated, respectively, with the mass, angular momentum and the separation distance. The whole set of the metric functions corresponding to\nthe axis data (1) which indeed define the simplest system of two Kerr black holes was given\nin [4] in the explicit analytical form. At the same time, only the parameter m\u2032 in (1) is equal\nto the Komar mass [6] of each constituent, whereas a\u2032 does not represent exactly the angular momentum per unit mass (neither k \u2032 is precisely the coordinate distance between the\ncenters of the horizons). Obviously, the solution for the counter\u2013rotating Kerr black holes\nwill be physically more transparent if it is rewritten in terms of three physical parameters\nwhich are the mass M, angular momentum per unit mass a and the relative coordinate distance R exactly. Performing of such reparametrization and working out the limit of extreme\ncounter\u2013rotating Kerr black holes constitute the main two objectives of the present paper.\n\n\fTo accomplish the first goal, we shall make use of the expression for the irreducible mass\n\u03c3 as function of M, a, R obtained in [7] by solving the respective boundary Riemann\u2013Hilbert\nproblem, and also of the general theory of equatorially antisymmetric spacetimes developed\nin [8]; this will permit us to reparametrize the axis data (1) in terms of the parameters M,\na and R with the subsequent construction of the corresponding Ernst potential and metric\nfunctions by employing the general formulas of the paper [9]. The second objective will be\nachieved on the way of first identifying the asymptotically flat and equatorially antisymmetric member of the Kinnersley\u2013Chitre family of vacuum solutions [10] which provides the\nrequired limit of extreme Kerr black holes, and then the use of Yamazaki's formulas [11] for\nworking out the corresponding metric functions.\n\nII.\n\nTHE REPARAMETRIZED NON\u2013EXTREME SOLUTION\n\nThe solution derived in the paper [4] involves the functions ri =\n\np\n\n\u03c12 + (z \u2212 \u03b1i )2 whose\n\nconstants \u03b1i determine the location of black holes on the symmetry axis (see Fig. 1). In our\ncase of identical counter\u2013rotating black holes we have \u03b11 = \u2212\u03b14 , \u03b12 = \u2212\u03b13 , and hence the\nconstants \u03b1i can be reparametrized as follows:\n\u03b11 =\nR =\n\n1\nR\n2\n\n+ \u03c3,\n\n1\n(\u03b11\n2\n\n\u03b12 = 21 R \u2212 \u03c3,\n\n+ \u03b12 \u2212 \u03b13 \u2212 \u03b14 ),\n\n\u03b13 = \u2212 12 R + \u03c3,\n\n\u03b14 = \u2212 21 R \u2212 \u03c3,\n\n\u03c3 = 21 (\u03b11 \u2212 \u03b12 ) = 12 (\u03b13 \u2212 \u03b14 ),\n\n(2)\n\nwhere R is the coordinate distance between the centers of the black hole horizons (the two\nrods in Fig. 1), and \u03c3 is the so\u2013called irreducible mass which is equal to the half length of\neach rod.\nThe crucial point now is to have the expression of \u03c3 in terms of the physical quantities\ncharacterizing the binary system under consideration, which are the mass M, the angular\nmomentum per unit mass a of the lower black hole (the angular momentum of the upper\nblack hole is \u2212Ma), and the relative coordinate distance R. The desired expression for \u03c3\nwas obtained in the paper [7] by Varzugin who studied the interaction force between the\nKerr black holes via the boundary Riemann\u2013Hilbert problem posed on the symmetry axis.\nIn the case of two counter\u2013rotating identical black holes he was able to derive the following\nimportant relation:\n\u03c3=\n\np\nM 2 \u2212 a2 \u03bc,\n\n\u03bc :=\n\nR \u2212 2M\n.\nR + 2M\n\n(3)\n\n\fUsing formula (3), we can reparametrize the axis data (1) in terms of the constants M, a\nand R. Indeed, according to the general study of the equatorially symmetric/antisymmetric\nspacetimes [8], the axis data (1) define the equatorially antisymmetric solution and hence\ncan be written in the form\ne(z) =\n\n(z + \u03b21 )(z + \u03b22 )\n,\n(z \u2212 \u03b21 )(z \u2212 \u03b22 )\n\n(4)\n\nwhere the complex poles \u03b21 and \u03b22 satisfy the relation \u03b21 + \u03b22 = \u22122M. Recalling that the\nconstants \u03b1i are roots of the equation\ne(z) + \u0113(z) = 0,\n\n(5)\n\nwe find the explicit form of \u03b21 and \u03b22 from the equation\ne(z) + \u0113(z) =\n\n2(z \u2212 \u03b11 )(z \u2212 \u03b12 )(z \u2212 \u03b13 )(z \u2212 \u03b14 )\n(z \u2212 \u03b21 )(z \u2212 \u03b22 )(z \u2212 \u03b2\u03041 )(z \u2212 \u03b2\u03042 )\n\n(6)\n\nby equating the coefficients at the same powers of z on the right\u2013hand and left\u2013hand sides\nof (6). The result for e(z) is the following simple expression:\ne(z) =\n\nz 2 \u2212 2Mz \u2212 ( 21 R + M \u2212 ia)2 \u03bc\n,\nz 2 + 2Mz \u2212 ( 21 R + M \u2212 ia)2 \u03bc\n\n(7)\n\nwhich is the desired reparametrization of the data (1) in physical parameters.\nOnce the axis data are established, the corresponding Ernst potential and the metric\nfunctions f , \u03b3 and \u03c9 entering the stationary axisymmetric line element\nds2 = f \u22121 [e2\u03b3 (d\u03c12 + dz 2 ) + \u03c12 d\u03c62 ] \u2212 f (dt \u2212 \u03c9d\u03c6)2\n\n(8)\n\ncan be worked out with the aid of the general formulas obtained in the paper [9] for the\nanalytically extended vacuum multi\u2013soliton solution.

By construction, the mass M enters the metric (9) as an arbitrary\nparameter, and so does J through the parameter a because the angular momentum of the\nlower black hole is J = Ma (the upper black hole possesses the angular momentum \u2212J and\nthe angular velocity \u2212\u03a9). The quantities \u03ba, S and \u03a9 are defined on the horizon; for the\ncalculation of \u03ba and \u03a9 one can use the following simple formulas [13]:\n\u03ba=\n\n\u221a\n\n\u2212\u03c9 \u22122 e\u22122\u03b3 ,\n\n\u03a9 = \u03c9 \u22121 ,\n\n(12)\n\nwhere \u03c9 and \u03b3 must be evaluated on the horizon. The expression for \u03a9 was given by Varzugin\nin [7], while \u03ba can be derived straightforwardly from (9):\n\u03a9=\n\na\u03bc\n,\n2M(M + \u03c3)\n\n\u03ba=\n\nR\u03c3\n.\n2M(M + \u03c3)(R + 2M)\n\n(13)\n\nThe expression for S then follows from (11) and (13):\n\u0010\n2M \u0011\n4\u03c0\u03c3\n.\n= 8\u03c0M(M + \u03c3) 1 +\nS=\n\u03ba\nR\n\n(14)\n\nThe interaction force in the system of counter\u2013rotating identical Kerr black holes was\nshown by Varzugin to be the same as in the case of two identical Schwarzschild black holes\n[7]:\nF=\n\nM2\n.\nR2 \u2212 4M 2\n\n(15)\n\n\fThe extreme limit of the solution (9) is defined by the equality \u03c3 = 0, whence one finds\nR=\n\n2M(a2 + M 2 )\n.\na2 \u2212 M 2\n\n(16)\n\nThis means, firstly, that for all M > 0 the inequality a2 > M 2 holds for the extreme counter\u2013\nrotating constituents, unlike in the case of a single Kerr black hole [14] for which a2 = M 2 ;\nand, secondly, that, given a2 > M 2 , there exists a distance (16) at which the subextreme\nconstituents become the extreme ones. At the same time, it should be pointed out that the\nlimit \u03c3 = 0 requires the application of l'Hospital rule in the formulas (9) and, therefore,\nneeds a special treatment.1\n\nIII.\n\nTHE LIMIT \u03c3 = 0\n\nThe simplest way of obtaining the solution for two extreme counter\u2013rotating Kerr black\nholes consists in the use of the already known classical results after observing that in the limit\n\u03c3 = 0 the metric (9) becomes a special member of the 5\u2013parameter Kinnersley\u2013Chitre family\nof vacuum spacetimes [10] for which the whole set of metrical fields was given by Yamazaki\n[11]. One only needs to find a concrete choice of the parameters in the Kinnersley\u2013Chitre\nsolution which leads to the axis data (7) with R defined by the formula (16). The analysis\nof the behavior of the potential (4.30) of [10] on the upper part of the symmetry axis (y = 1)\nreveals that the required choice of the parameters in the original Kinnersley\u2013Chitre formula\n(4.30) is the following:\nq = \u03b2 = 0,\n\np = 1,\n\n\u03b1=\n\n2Ma\n,\n2\na \u2212 M2\n\nexp(\u2212i\u03bd) = b + ic =\n\na2 \u2212 M 2\n2Ma\n+i 2\n.\n2\n2\na +M\na + M2\n\n(17)\n\nIn addition, the prolate ellipsoidal coordinates (x, y) must be related to the cylindrical\ncoordinates (\u03c1, z) via the formulas\n\u03c1=k\n1\n\np\n\n(x2 \u2212 1)(1 \u2212 y 2),\n\nz = kxy,\n\nk=\n\nM(a2 + M 2 )\n.\na2 \u2212 M 2\n\n(18)\n\nIn a recent paper [15] Herdeiro and Rebelo claim to have obtained a solution for two extremal counter\u2013\nrotating Kerr black holes, but in reality their metric (3.8) has nothing to do with a genuine solution for\nsuch a binary system (however, for that case they correctly identify the inequality M 2 < a2 which is a\ntrivial consequence of Varzugin's expression for \u03c3).\n\n\fBelow we give the final expressions for E, f , \u03b3 and \u03c9 describing the extreme counter\u2013\nrotating Kerr black holes which were elaborated with the aid of Yamazaki's general formulas:\nA\u2212B\nN\nN\n, f = , e2\u03b3 =\n,\n2\n2\nA+B\nD\n(1 + \u03b1 ) (x2 \u2212 y 2 )4\n\u03c9 = 4k\u03b1y(x2 \u2212 1)(1 \u2212 y 2)W N \u22121 ,\nE =\n\nA = x4 \u2212 1 + \u03b12 (x2 \u2212 y 2)2 \u2212 2i\u03b1(x2 + y 2 \u2212 2x2 y 2 ),\nB = 2(b + ic)x[x2 \u2212 1 \u2212 i\u03b1(x2 \u2212 y 2 )],\nN = [(x2 \u2212 1)2 + \u03b12 (x2 \u2212 y 2 )2 ]2 \u2212 16\u03b12 x2 y 2(x2 \u2212 1)(1 \u2212 y 2 ),\nD = {x4 \u2212 1 + \u03b12 (x2 \u2212 y 2 )2 + 2x[b(x2 \u2212 1) + c\u03b1(x2 \u2212 y 2)]}2\n+ 4[\u03b1(x2 + y 2 \u2212 2x2 y 2) + cx(1 \u2212 y 2 )]2 ,\nW = c\u03b1(x2 \u2212 y 2)(3x2 + y 2) + b(3x4 + 6x2 \u2212 1) + 8x3 ,\n\n(19)\n\nwhere the constants \u03b1, b, c and k have been defined in (17) and (18).\nThe metric (19) describes two counter\u2013rotating extreme Kerr black holes separated by\nthe coordinate distance 2M(a2 + M 2 )/(a2 \u2212 M 2 ). Mention that (19) clearly shows that the\nmetric function \u03c9 takes zero value both on the part |z| > k of the symmetry axis (because\n\u03c9(y = \u00b11) = 0) and on the part |z| < k of the axis (because \u03c9(x = 1) = 0).\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nIn the present paper we have succeeded in bringing together various separate results on the\nsimplest binary system of Kerr black holes for working out the most physical representation\nof the metric describing such system both in the subextreme case and in the limiting case\nof extremal black holes. It turns out that if the inequality M 2 > a2 holds, the black holes\nremain to be the subextreme constituents at any separation distance. On the other hand,\nif M 2 < a2 , then there exists a critical distance defined by the formula (16) before reaching\nwhich the black holes are subextreme objects; however, when this critical separation is\nachieved, the black holes become extremal, and at larger distances the constituents convert\ninto the hyperextreme objects. The latter situation is also covered by the metric (9) because\nwe have been working within the framework of Sibgatullin's method [16] and analytically\nextended spacetimes [17].\nLastly, we remark that it would be also interesting to construct an exact solution for two\n\n\fcorotating Kerr black holes separated by a massless strut, but this problem is technically\nmore complicated than the one considered in the present paper and still remains a task for\nthe future.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThis work was partially supported by Project 45946\u2013F from CONACyT, Mexico, by\nProject FIS2006\u201305319 from MCyT, Spain, and by Project SA010C05 from Junta de Castilla\ny Le\u00f3n, Spain.\n\n[1] D.
