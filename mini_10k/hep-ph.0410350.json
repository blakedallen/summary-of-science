Introduction\nBy 1991 the weak coupling was measured with much higher precision than the\nstrong one at LEP. In a renowned paper 1 the famous plot was produced, showing\nthat in contrast to the SM the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM)\nleads to a single unification scale of a Grand Unified Theory (GUT), if we let the\ncouplings run according to the MSSM theory:\nMSUSY = 103.0\u00b11.0 GeV ; MGUT = 1016.0\u00b10.3 GeV ; 1/\u03b1GUT = 25.7 \u00b1 1.7\nwhere MSUSY is a single generic SUSY scale where the spectrum of supersymmetric\nparticles starts to play a role, MGUT is the scale of grand unification where the\nelectromagnetic, weak and strong coupling come together as an unified coupling\nlept\n\u03b1GUT . In 1991, at the Z mass scale MZ , the relative errors in \u03b1(MZ ), sin2 \u03b8eff\n(MZ )\nand \u03b1s (MZ ) were 0.24, 0.77 and 4.6 % respectively.\nFrom Review of Particle Properties 2 (RPP) 2004 the relative error in \u03b1(MZ ),\n2 lept\nsin \u03b8eff (MZ ) and \u03b1s (MZ ) is 0.014, 0.065 and 1.7 %, so we have improved in the\nlast decade by more than an order of magnitude except for the strong coupling (less\nthan 3 times). So the time is ripe for new analyses, and one is presented here. a\nA word of caution: it is amazing that we are trying to extrapolate from 102\nto 1016 GeV. From experiments we now that even interpolation or modest extrapa Some\n\nrecent analyses are 3,4 .\n1\n\n\fDecember 24, 2018 22:32 WSPC/INSTRUCTION FILE\n\n2\n\ndpf04coupl\n\nDimitri Bourilkov\n\nolations can be non-trivial. We measure the \"offsets\", i.e. the value of the three\ncouplings, around the Z peak and rely on theory to give us the \"slopes\" of the\nrunning couplings - without errors - up to the GUT scale. This may be an illusion e.g. extra dimensions could modify the running already at TeV scales, so the\n\"unification\" point may be imaginary.\n2. Experimental Inputs\nFrom Review of Particle Properties 2004:\nlept\n1/\u03b1(MZ ) = 127.918 \u00b1 0.018 ; sin2 \u03b8eff\n(MZ ) = 0.23120 \u00b1 0.00015.\n\nThe strong coupling \u03b1s (MZ ) is a more complicated story, characterized by much\nlarger statistical errors and theory uncertainties. Different measurements and world\naverages typically fall in two groups which we will call \"high\" and \"low\" values:\n\u03b1s (MZ ) = 0.1224 \u00b1 0.0038 f rom \u0393h /\u0393\u03bc at Z peak (RP P 2004)\n\u03b1s (MZ ) = 0.1213 \u00b1 0.0018 Global Electroweak F it (RP P EW Section)\n\u03b1s (MZ ) = 0.1187 \u00b1 0.0020 RP P QCD section\n\u03b1s (MZ ) = 0.1183 \u00b1 0.0027 S.Bethke W orld aver. LEP/SLC, Deep Inel. Scatt. 5\n3. Analysis Technique\nWe perform a \u03c72 minimization with MINUIT for three parameters: MSUSY , MGUT\nand 1/\u03b1GUT . A strong correlation (> 0.999) between MGUT and 1/\u03b1GUT is observed. The minimization problem can be re-factored with two parameters, taking\n1/\u03b1GUT as the weighted average of the three couplings at any given scale. The results for the parameter values are numerically the same, except for the error on the\nGUT coupling. Even so the correlation MSUSY \u2212 MGUT is > 0.96.\nAn important point is how to compute the running couplings. We perform the\nanalysis two times:\n\u2022 1-loop Renormalization Group (RG) running - can solve analytically; the coefficients for the 3 couplings are independent, given by the SM or MSSM:\n1/\u03b1(\u03bd) = 1/\u03b1(\u03bc) \u2212 (bi /2\u03c0) * ln(\u03bd/\u03bc).\n\u2022 2-loop-RG running: additional terms so the 3 couplings depend on each other solved numerically; the errors depend on the scale (for typical GUT scales they\ngrow by 4, 12 and 6 % respectively for the three couplings). Here a threshold correction to \u03b1s (MGUT ) is applied in order to meet the GUT boundary condition. 2\n4. Results and Discussion\nThe results of the fits are summarized in Table 1. The MSSM still can provide\ncoupling unification at a GUT scale well below the Planck scale for the full set of\nprecise 2004 measurements. The strong coupling is a key for interpreting the results:\nthe \"high\" \u03b1s (MZ ) values require an uncomfortably low SUSY scale \u223c 10 GeV -\n\n\fDecember 24, 2018 22:32 WSPC/INSTRUCTION FILE\n\ndpf04coupl\n\n1/\u03b1i(\u03bc)\n\nA Fresh Look at Gauge Coupling Unification\n\n26\n\n3\n\n\uf8e9 D.Bourilkov 2004\n\n25\n24\n23\n22\n21\n20\n19\n10\n\nFig. 1.\n\n13\n\n10\n\n14\n\n10\n\n15\n\n10\n\n16\n\n10\n\n17\n\n10\n\n18\n\n10\n\n19\n\nGeV\n\nExample of SUSY fit with 1-loop-RG running.

The results for 2-loop-RG-running with\ncorrection -4 % give similar values for the SUSY scale as 1-loop-RG. The GUT scale\nis higher: MGUT = 1016.7\u00b10.1 GeV, pushing the proton lifetime (\u223c 1036 years) well\nbeyond the experimental limits (\u223c 5 x 1033 years).
