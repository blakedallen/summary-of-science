The interactions we consider are the ones characterized by well\ndefined energy thresholds whose energy position can be predicted on the basis\nof special relativity.

INTRODUCTION\n\nThe study of interactions of high energy Cosmic Rays (nucleons and gamma rays) can\nprovide severe tests of the validity of Special Relativity (SR). Indeed, SR is at the very base\nof our theories for the description of the Universe, and its validity is generally not questioned.\nHowever, several attempts have been made to put under scrutiny the postulates that SR\nrelies upon, like the constancy of the velocity of light, and these studies have contributed\naccurate limits on possible violations (see e.g. [1] and references therein).\n1\n\n\fAlthough it is very well proven that SR and the underlying Lorentz invariance (LI)\nprovide a suitable framework for our low energy effective theories, it is not clear whether\nmore ambitious theories, aiming to a global description of our World, including gravity,\nare or need to be Lorentz invariant. Theoretically, the need for a unified theory of gravity\nhas led to several models, some of which automatically imply the breaking of LI. This is\nqualitatively understandable since the very concept of continuous space-time is likely to be\nprofoundly changed by quantum gravitational effects [2]. In this prospective we think it is\nworth keeping an open mind with respect to the validity of what we define as fundamental\ntheories, and always put them under experimental scrutiny.\nThis attitude appears even more justified at the present time: observationally, high\nenergy astrophysics is providing a range of opportunities to probe energies (i.e. Lorentz\nfactors, or speeds) much larger than the ones ever obtained, or obtainable in the future, in\naccelerator experiments. In particular we concentrate our attention on the interactions of\ncosmic gamma rays and nucleons with some type of universal photon background, i.e. the\ncosmic microwave (CMB), the far infrared (FIRB), and the radio background. These are the\ninteractions responsible for gamma ray absorption from distant sources (through production\nof e+ e\u2212 ) [3\u20135], that should appear as a cutoff in the gamma ray spectrum, and of the\nwell known Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin (GZK) cutoff [6,7] due to the photopion production\nin collisions of ultra high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) off the CMB photons. All these\nprocesses have the same general structure: in a Lorentz invariant picture, these reactions\nwould be examples of very low energy processes in the center of momentum, that appear\nboosted to very large Lorentz factors in the laboratory frame. Testing the presence of the\nthresholds for these processes is therefore a test of SR up to the large Lorentz factors in the\nboost.\nOur approach is entirely phenomenological, and reasonably model independent. We do\nnot propose, if not as examples, any specific model. We show that when a very general\n\n2\n\n\fform of LI violation\n\n1\n\nis explicitly allowed in the dispersion relation between energy and\n\nmomentum of particles, the threshold momenta for some of these reactions may drastically\nchange or even become unphysical (i.e. the process does not occur), unless the LI violation\nis introduced at a length scale much smaller than the Planck scale. A similar approach,\nalthough more specific, was proposed in [8] (see Sect. 3).\nThe aim of the present paper is to discuss the possibility that future CR experiments\ncould test Special Relativity and/or the structure of space-time [9]. In our opinion, the (lack\nof) knowledge of the sources of the CR's under consideration does not allow us to support\nthe idea [1,10\u201312] that the present experimental situation gives evidence for violation of LI\nor of continuity of space-time. Rather we stress that a verification of the existence of the\nquoted thresholds would entail a lower limit on the mass scale of effective LI violations.\nThe paper is planned as follows: in section 2 we discuss our parametrization of the LI\nviolations, and discuss briefly some models in which these parametrizations hold; in section\n3 we apply our calculations to the case of pair production and photopion production in high\nenergy cosmic ray interactions. We conclude in section 4.\n\nII. BREAKING OF LORENTZ INVARIANCE\n\nLorentz invariance implies that the modulus of any four-vector is unchanged when changing reference frame; for instance for the four-momentum of a particle we have (we always\n\n1 Clearly,\n\nbreaking LI can have several implications, as for instance the existence of a preferred\n\nreference frame, which is the one in which all the calculations need to be carried out, since breaking\nLI also invalidates the transformations that allow us to change reference frame. This reference\nframe could be identified with the one comoving with the expansion of the universe (no peculiar\nmotion), in which the microwave background is completely isotropic. In fact, there is only one\nframe with this property, being all other frames experiencing the dipole anisotropy, and therefore\ndistinguishable.\n\n3\n\n\fput c = h\u0304 = 1)\nP\u03bc P \u03bc = E 2 \u2212 p2 = const = m2\nm being the invariant particle mass and p = |~p|.\nViolations of Lorentz invariance will therefore affect in general the dispersion relation\nabove. Without referring to any specific model (later we will discuss explicit implementations), we write a modified dispersion relation obeying the following postulates:\n1. Violations are a high energy effect, i.e. they vanish at small momenta.\n2. Violations are universal, i.e. do not depend on the particle type, if not (possibly)\nthrough the particle mass.\n3. Rotation invariance remains exact.\nClearly requirements 2 and 3 may be relaxed and in fact there are examples in this sense\n[1,13]. We write then the modified dispersion relation as follows:\nE 2 \u2212 p2 \u2212 m2 = p2 f (\n\np\np\n) + m2 g( )\nM\nM\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the mass M parametrizes the violation of Lorentz invariance (or an essential\ndiscreteness of space-time, as for instance suggested by some models of quantum gravity\n(e.g. [2] and [14\u201316])). Even in the framework defined above this is not the most general\nviolation term. However, in the regime we are interested in, m \u226a p \u226a M, the left hand\nside of eq. (1) is small compared to p2 and E 2 so that the other possible terms we can write\n(containing for instance E) differ from those in eq. (1) by higher order corrections 2 .\nSince p/M \u226a 1 the functions f and g can be Taylor-expanded to give:\nE 2 \u2212 p2 \u2212 m2 = p2 (f (0) + f \u2032 (0)\n\n2\n\np2\np\n+ f \u2032\u2032 (0) 2 + ...)+\nM\nM\n\nAlso, terms proportional to mp can be added. They however do not modify the general frame-\n\nwork so we will not include them for sake of clarity.\n\n4\n\n\fm2 (g(0) + g \u2032 (0)\n\np2\np\n+ g \u2032\u2032 (0) 2 + ...)\nM\nM\n\n(2)\n\nIn the limit M \u2192 \u221e one must recover the Lorentz invariant dispersion relation, so f (0) =\ng(0) = 0; moreover the linear term might be absent, as we will see later; if it is present,\nthe quadratic term is negligible at the momenta we consider. The coefficients in front of\nthe first and second derivatives are left unconstrained. However, if |f \u2032(0)|, |g \u2032(0)| \u226b 1 or\n|f \u2032\u2032 (0)|, |g \u2032\u2032(0)| \u226b 1, then the functions f and g would be strongly varying and possibly\noscillating, which would be unphysical. Moreover, in cases where the calculations of the\nLI breaking can be carried out explicitly (see section 2A), these coefficients turn out to be\nof order unity (the same motivation justifies the assumption that these coefficients are not\nmuch smaller than unity). Therefore we decided to adopt here a phenomenological approach\nand assume that possible small deviations from unity are embedded in the mass scale M.\nThe validity of this approach will be checked a posteriori.\nWe are thus led to the following classification of Lorentz non-invariant dispersion relations:\nI\u00b1 :\n\nII\u00b1 :\n\np3\nE \u2212p \u2248 m \u00b1\nM\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\nE 2 \u2212 p2 \u2248 m2 \u00b1\n\np4\nM2\n\nm2 p\n(\u00b1\n)\nM\n\n(\u00b1\n\nm2 p2\n)\nM2\n\n(3)\n\n(4)\n\nwhere I (II) stands for first (second) order modification and the terms in parenthesis\ncome from the expansion of g.\nWe can define a critical momentum pc where the correction, for massive particles, equals\nm2 , which is the momentum for which we expect that deviations from normal relativistic\nkinematics become relevant. We have pc \u2248 2 \u00d71015 eV (\u2248 1013 eV) for protons (electrons) in\nthe case I\u00b1 and pc \u2248 3 \u00d7 1018 eV (\u2248 1017 eV) for protons (electrons) in the case II\u00b1 . In the\ncases in parenthesis in eqs. (3) and (4) we have always pc \u2248 M, so these modifications do not\nlead to observable consequences at the energies we are interested in; we will therefore put\ng( Mp ) = 0 in the following. We will come back to this point when we will describe specific\n5\n\n\fexamples of Lorentz violating theories [8]. It is clear that the values of pc given above\nare calculated in a specific frame; in fact, generally, violations of LI imply the existence\nof a privileged frame. We choose this frame to be the one comoving with the expansion\nof the universe (we name it \"universal frame\"), and we argue that this choice is in fact\nnot arbitrary: this is the only possible frame where the microwave background is isotropic\n(the same holds for the other backgrounds, provided the sources are homogeneously and\nisotropically distributed). Moreover, neglecting the proper motion of the Earth, this is the\nreference frame in which we live and measure the thresholds for physical processes. On a\nmore practical ground, it is worth noticing that giving up LI, the Lorentz transformations\ndo not correctly give the transformations laws of energy and momentum between different\nframes although in principle it is possible to write modified transformations of energy and\nmomentum (see for instance [17]) which reproduce, at least at the perturbative level chosen,\nthe dispersion relations above. In this case, however, there is much more arbitrariness than\nin modifying the dispersion relation and we do not pursue this approach in this paper. It is\nworth noting however that the Lorentz Transformations are derived in a LI theory by the\nrequirement of the invariance of a fundamental interval, so in a sense a modification of the\ndispersion relation is more fundamental.\nThere is a further, important point to discuss before computing particle production\nthresholds. In fact, when one gives up relativistic invariance, energy-momentum conservation is not anymore guaranteed, and relativistic quantum field theory may fail, so there is\nno guidance in deriving cross sections. However, our point of view here is to derive the\nconsequences of experimental verification of the existence of the particle thresholds, so we\nwill assume in the following exact energy-momentum conservation and relativistic dynamics\nin the preferential frame.\n\n6\n\n\fA. Models\n\nIn the following we will briefly discuss some models in which modified dispersion relations\nare actually obtained. It has been argued on very general grounds that quantum gravity\neffects do modify particle propagation at scales close to the Planck scale. In particular,\nmodified uncertainty relations and existence of a minimum proper length (see e.g. [18]\nand references therein) (implying modifications of Lorentz transformations), and light-cone\nfluctuations (see e.g. [19] and references therein) are fairly general implications of quantum\ngravity and modify the dispersion relations.\nAn approach where a fundamental mass/momentum scale M is introduced to parametrize\nthe deviations from LI can be pursued by writing the commutators between (space) boosts\nand translation generators of the Poincare' algebra in a modified form [20], leading to\nE4\n12M 2\n\n\u2022 II+\n\nE\nm2 = M 2 sin2 ( M\n) \u2212 p2 \u223c E 2 \u2212 p2 \u2212\n\n\u2022 II\u2212\n\nE\nm2 = M 2 sinh2 ( M\n) \u2212 p2 \u223c E 2 \u2212 p2 +\n\nE4\n3M 2\n\nA theory with both exact conservation of energy and momentum and LI violations can be\nobtained if it is possible to construct a local theory which is symmetric under the modified\nPoincar\u00e9 group [21]\nModels giving the I\u00b1 dispersion relations can be derived from some quantum gravity\napproach. The basic idea is that quantum fluctuations of gravity cause, at a scale of Plank\nmass, the vacuum to behave like a stochastic medium and this introduces non-zero, energy\ndependent non-diagonal terms in the metric [14],\n\u2022 I+ :\n\ng\u03bc\u03bd \u2192 g\u03bc\u03bd + h0i\n\nh0i = Ui\n\n~ = \u2212 E p\u0302\nU\nM\n\n\u2022 I\u2212 :\n\ng\u03bc\u03bd \u2192 g\u03bc\u03bd + h0i\n\nh0i = Ui\n\n~ =\nU\n\nE\np\u0302\nM\n\n,\n\nwith consequent modifications of the dispersion relations. Similar modifications may hold in\nbrane models with large (or even infinite) extra dimensions and T eV scale quantum gravity\n[22], where in some cases Poincare' invariance is broken explicitely [23].\n7\n\n\fIn the models presented above, quantum gravity effects are described by fluctuations\naround a flat background metric. An entirely different approach is followed in the loop\napproach to quantum gravity (see e.g [16] and references therein) in which the geometry itself\nemerges non perturbatively. It has been shown that this leads to an essential discretization\nof space, and to modifications of the dispersion relations which fall in the class I\u00b1 if parity\nis broken; the violation might be milder (or absent) in parity conserving models.\nWe finish quoting a pioneering approach by Kirshnitz and Chechin [8], stimulated by\nthe appearance of the papers by Kuzmin and Zatsepin [7], and Greisen [6]. It is a classical\napproach, in which the free lagrangian of a (classical) point particle is modified. The theory\nis defined replacing the pseudo-Euclidean space-time of SR with a Finslerian space [24]. In\nthis approach the dispersion relation becomes\nm2 = [1 + \u1e21(\u03b1\n\np2\n)](E 2 \u2212 p2 ),\n2\nE\n\n(5)\n\nwhere m is the particle mass, and \u1e21 is a homogeneous function of the dimensionless\nparameter \u03b1 that parametrizes the LI violations, \u03b1 =\n\nm2\nM2\n\nin terms of the scale M. This gives\n\nrise to a mild violation, disappearing for massless particles. With an appropriate choice of\nthe function \u1e21, this gives rise to the terms in parenthesis in eqs. (3) and (4).\n\nIII. THRESHOLD CALCULATIONS WITH MODIFIED DISPERSION\nRELATIONS\n\nIn this section we describe the calculation of the kinematic thresholds for some processes\nin the framework of the modified dispersion relations between energy and momentum introduced in the previous section. We choose two processes which are of astrophysical relevance\nand that will be accessible to next generation cosmic ray experiments: pair production in\nphoton-photon scattering and photopion production in nucleon-gamma scattering. The first\nprocess is responsible for the absorption of high energy gamma rays from distant sources,\nwhile the second is responsible for the well known (and currently unobserved) GZK cutoff.\n8\n\n\fA. e+ e\u2212 production in photon-photon interactions\n\nThe process under investigation is \u03b3\u03b3 \u2192 e+ e\u2212 . The energy of the background photons\nis taken as \u03c9 = |k| (where k is the photon momentum) since at the typical background\nmomenta (FIRB: \u03c9 \u2248 0.01 eV, CMB: \u2248 6 \u00d7 10\u22124 eV, and radio: \u2248 4 \u00d7 10\u22129 eV for the\npeak of the corresponding radiance distributions) the corrections are entirely negligible. We\ncompute the threshold, assuming that the CR particle and the background photon collide\nhead-on, and the final particles are collinear. This is indeed not an arbitrary configuration,\nbut the one that provides the minimum energy for which the process can occur in the\nuniversal frame.\nRotational invariance then implies that in this reaction the momenta of final particles\nare equal, and that particles move in the direction of the primary, so that the problem is\none-dimensional; the energy of the background photon is assumed to be equal to the average\nfor the photon background in consideration.\nLet then (E, p) be the energy and (modulus of) the momentum of the incident photon.\nWriting the relations of conservation of energy and momentum in the laboratory frame, and\nusing the modified dispersion relation between energy and momentum, after some trivial\nalgebra, and neglecting sub-leading terms in the range of momenta we are considering, we\nget the following general equations for the threshold:\nI\u00b1 :\n\n\u00b1\u03b1I x3 + x \u2212 1 = 0,\n\n(6)\n\nII\u00b1 :\n\n\u00b1\u03b1II x4 + x \u2212 1 = 0,\n\n(7)\n\nwhere x = pth /p0 , p0 = m2 /\u03c9 is the threshold for M \u2192 \u221e\n(i.e. the usual threshold, \u2248 3 \u00d7 1013 eV for the FIRB as background, \u2248 5 \u00d7 1014 eV for\nthe CMB, and finally \u2248 6 \u00d7 1019 for the radio background), m the electron mass, and:\n\u03b1I =\n\np30\n;\n8m2 M\n\n\u03b1II =\n\n9\n\n3p40\n.\n16m2 M 2\n\n(8)\n\n\fThe modified thresholds are the positive real solutions of the equations above, and in\nparticular, if more than one positive solution is present, the one which goes to x = 1 as\nM \u2192 \u221e. In table I we report the solutions (if any) of the eqs. (6) and (7) in the case\nM = MP , reasonable in quantum gravity models, for the infrared, microwave, and radio\nbackground.\nThe general feature of these solutions is that a positive modification of the dispersion\nrelation tends to move the thresholds towards lower momentum values; negative modifications tend to lead to complex solutions, meaning that the kinematics of the process becomes\nforbidden, i.e. the threshold disappears. Case II is less predictive, as it is obvious being\nthe modification of second order in the (small) quantity p/M. Clearly a more detailed calculation, accounting for the integration over different scattering angles and over the whole\nspectrum of the photon background, could give slightly different results, not changing however our basic findings.\nTo assess the role of CR experiments to detect violations of LI we now assume that in\npresent or future experiments it will be possible to isolate the effect of pair production on\ndifferent photon backgrounds, by measuring the respective thresholds, with an experimental\nuncertainty on the measurement of the threshold energy of \u2248 100%. This is a conservative\n(and probably pessimistic) approach, unless possibly for the radio case. We therefore derive\na lower limit on M(6= MP ), which we report in table II.\nNote that all these limits are more stringent than the few limits on M already obtained\n(see for instance [25]). Exceptions to this statement come from the cases II\u00b1 for the IR and\nmicrowave backgrounds, where the limits on M are appreciably smaller that MP , leaving\nmore room for non Lorentz invariant theories.\nWe now discuss the present situation of VHE/UHE \u03b3-ray astronomy in view of the\npossibility of testing LI. In doing this it is important to keep in mind the quite different\nobservational situation existing for the CMB versus the IR and Radio backgrounds: while\nthe former is determined with very high accuracy, the IR and Radio backgrounds are very\npoorly known and difficult to access through observational investigation, mainly due to the\n10\n\n\femission and/or absorption processes in our Galaxy.\nObservationally, the infrared gamma-ray cutoff seems to be the one more easily approachable. Indeed signs of a cutoff in the TeV spectrum of a few blazars seem to be already\npresent ( [26\u201330]) and helped to impose some constraints on the extragalactic far-infrared\nbackground (FIRB). Unfortunately, as it is clear from table I, the case of interaction with\nthe FIRB is not very predictive, in the sense that the threshold is not appreciably changed\nwith respect to the case of a Lorentz-invariant theory, for most of the possible parametrizations of LI breaking (using M = MP ). The case I\u2212 is an exception: in this case there is no\nacceptable solution of the equations that define the threshold, which means that the process\nis not possible at all. In other words, in this case no cutoff should be seen in astrophysical\nobservations because photons can come unattenuated from all distances. Viceversa, if a\ncutoff is observed, then a lower limit on M can be imposed.\nAs far as the photon absorption on the CMB radiation is concerned, the experimental\nsituation is more uncertain, due to the higher energy of the \u03b3-rays involved (although there\nmight be suggestion of attenuation due to CMB, see e.g. [31,32]). This is theoretically\nmore restrictive: in the scenario I+ the threshold is moved to smaller values. For M = MP ,\nphotons with energy as small as \u223c 25 TeV from a distant source should be absorbed. In order\nfor the threshold to be unchanged, the scale M must exceed \u223c 800MP . In the scenario I\u2212\nthe process becomes not allowed, while in the other cases the threshold remains unchanged.\nThe case of scattering off the radio background is the most interesting. We predict, for\nM = MP , either no threshold (cases I\u2212 and II\u2212 ) or thresholds which are much smaller that\nthe canonical ones. This could be of great importance for top-down models of UHECRs,\nwhere gamma rays are supposed to have an important role in the composition (e.g. see\n[33]). In particular the proton/gamma ratio is determined by the interaction of the gamma\nrays with the radio background at frequencies smaller than a few MHz. Unfortunately, as\nmentioned above, the radio background at these frequencies is extremely uncertain, and not\naccessible to any direct measurement, due to the strong free-free absorption in the disc and\nhalo of our own Galaxy.\n11\n\n\fB. Pion photoproduction in UHECR interactions: the GZK cutoff\n\nThis case is slightly more involved since the masses of the final particles are different,\nso that even for a rotation invariant modification, final momenta are not in the same ratio\nas the masses. However we checked that assuming the ratio of final momenta as in the\nLorentz invariant theory, we introduce only higher order corrections. Using this prescription\nwe obtain the following two equations for the threshold, with the same symbols used in the\nprevious section:\n\nwhere x =\n\npth\np0\n\nand p0 =\n\nI\u00b1 :\n\n\u00b1\u03b1I x3 + x \u2212 1 = 0\n\n(9)\n\nII\u00b1 :\n\n\u00b1\u03b1II x4 + x \u2212 1 = 0\n\n(10)\n\nm2\u03c0 +2m\u03c0 mp\n4\u03c9\n\nis the conventional threshold (for M \u2192 \u221e), mp is\n\nthe proton (neutron) mass, and m\u03c0 is the pion mass. The coefficients \u03b1I,II are defined as\nfollows:\n\u03b1I =\n\nm\u03c0 mp\n2p30\n;\n2\n(m\u03c0 + 2m\u03c0 mp )M (m\u03c0 + mp )2\n\n\u03b1II =\n\n(11)\n\n3p40\nm\u03c0 mp\n.\n(m2\u03c0 + 2m\u03c0 mp )M 2 (m\u03c0 + mp )2\n\nFixing M = MP we have the solutions reported in table III.\nThe general trend of the solutions is the same as in the case of pair production. Here\nhowever we can easily see that the consequences are even more evident: in all cases either\nthe threshold disappears and the process becomes forbidden (cases I\u2212 and II\u2212 ), or the\nthreshold is appreciably lowered (cases I+ and II+ ). For I\u2212 or II\u2212 parametrizations, the\nGZK cutoff is completely washed out and particles (nucleons) should be able to reach us\nfrom any distance. In the other cases the threshold falls in a region that is easy to discard\neven on the basis of the present data, unless the scale of breaking of LI is \u223c 3 \u00d7 1013 (\u223c 500)\ntimes larger than the Planck mass for the case I+ (II+ ).\n12\n\n\fAs in the previous section, if one assumes that the apparent absence of the GZK cut-off\nis an incidental fact, possibly due to our ignorance of the sources of CR's at these energies,\nand that CR experiments may find some remnant of the cut-off, we can derive limits on\nthe parameters of LI violations. These limits are reported in table III, again assuming a\n100% error on the location of the cut-off. From the values reported it is clear that UHECR\nexperiments soon to be available will provide a powerful tool to explore the very-small-scale\nstructure of space-time.\n\nIV. CONCLUSIONS\n\nSpecial Relativity is at the base of our understanding of the physical world. However\nany physical concept should always be put under stringent experimental verification. This is\nparticularly true in the case of SR, specially in connection with the quest for a fundamental\ntheory of Nature, which includes gravity. Any such theory will imply a full knowledge of\nwhat the vacuum really is at the level where quantum fluctuations build the space-time,\npossibly modelling it with a non-trivial geometry. Some first attempts to reach this goal\nseem to suggest that Lorentz invariance, one of the building blocks of our current low energy\ntheories, could be broken at extremely high energy.\nLacking a true theory of quantum gravity, the most we can do at present is to adopt a\nphenomenological approach and ask ourselves whether there is any probe that can be used\nto check the validity of SR at very high energy. This is precisely the approach adopted\nin this paper, where high energy cosmic rays (nucleons and gamma rays) have been used\nas probes. We found that the thresholds for pair production and photopion production off\nsome universal photon backgrounds, which are experimentally accessible or will be in the\nnext generation of cosmic ray experiments, are often profoundly affected by the possibility\nof breaking LI at supra-Planck scales. As a consequence, any quantum gravity theory in\nwhich LI is a casualty must face the cosmic ray bound in order to be viable.\nOur calculations were based on a perturbative but quite general modification of the\n13\n\n\fdispersion relation between energy and momentum of a particle. This modification affects\nin a fundamental way the calculation of the thresholds for pair production and photopion\nproduction, making these processes forbidden in some cases, or lowering the thresholds to\nquestionable values in others. Building on this approach we proposed a procedure to obtain\nvery strong constraints on the energy (or length) scale at which a possible LI violation could\noccur.\nThis procedure relies upon the possibility that astrophysical observations will be able in\nthe near future to find evidence for these processes, through cutoffs in the TeV spectra of\ndistant blazars or/and through the discovery of possible consequences of the GZK cutoff in\nthe spectrum of UHECRs or/and through studies of the composition of UHECRs. With a\nfew exceptions, these limits are all higher than the Planck scale, which is an indication that\nbreaking LI is not necessarily a safe ingredient of unified theories that require it.\nWe stress that our approach is purely kinematical and no dynamical effect is considered.\nMoreover, we assume perfect energy-momentum conservation in order to compute the thresholds. While these are clearly important issues for any calculation aiming to predict values for\nspecific particle production thresholds, and consequently absorption cutoffs in CR spectra,\nour approach is rather the opposite: we want to discuss the consequences of a possible experimental verification of the presence of particle production thresholds. If a given absorption\nthreshold is experimentally detected, discarding the possibility of miraculous compensations\nbetween relativity violations, non conservation of energy-momentum and non-relativistically\ninvariant dynamics, we are forced to conclude that possible violations of LI are smaller than\nthe sensitivity of the experiment, and, to make this statement quantitative, we choose to\nuse a purely kinematical, energy-momentum conserving parametrization.\nAlthough a very tempting possibility, we do not believe that the current experimental\nsituation allows us to draw definitive statements : recent observations of Markarian 501\nmight suggest the presence of a cutoff in the TeV region, but the unaffected spectrum is\nnot known well enough to exclude that the observed effect is the artifact of a cutoff in the\nproduction spectrum. Hopefully the situation will improve with the next generation gamma\n14\n\n\fray detectors, complemented by neutrino and X-ray detectors that could clarify the origin\nof the gamma ray emission. Concerning \u03b3\u2212rays absorption on CMB photons, experimental\ndata are more scarce, and the situation is not likely to improve in the near future.\nPair production on the universal radio background becomes relevant for ultra-high-energy\ngamma rays, usually produced in top-down models of UHECRs [33]. The presence or absence\nof a threshold for this process strongly affects our predictions of the fluxes at the Earth:\nalthough very uncertain, the radio background should allow typical gamma ray pathlengths\n(in a Lorentz invariant world) of the order of 2 \u2212 20 Mpc [34]. If a violation of LI made the\npair production kinematically forbidden, gamma rays could reach us from any distance and\ncontribute an enormous flux of particles above the GZK cutoff.\nAs for UHECRs, although the (small) number of events [35,36] above \u223c 5 \u00d7 1019 eV\nseems already incompatible with the presence of the GZK cutoff, the lack of knowledge\nof the sources does not allow any firm statement on the propagation of primaries in the\nUniverse. The situation will improve dramatically in the near future, as new experiments\nlike HiRes [37] and Auger [38] will collect data and reliable measurements on observables\ndifferent from the energy spectrum (anisotropy, clustering) will be available with reasonable\nstatistics.\nOur conclusions can be summarized in the following points: 1) it is a 40-years old\nidea that the incompleteness of the present theories could rely upon our ignorance of the\nvacuum at very high energies. When we will have that knowledge we will probably have a\nquantum theory of gravity; 2) several attempts to quantize gravity have naturally led to the\nrequirement of violations of the LI; 3) experiments on cosmic rays can represent the most\neasily approachable tool to probe the structure of space-time on the very small scales; 4) LI\nviolations affect the thresholds for elementary processes relevant for cosmic ray astrophysics\nand can be observationally tested.\nAfter the submission of this paper we have noticed some papers [39] which reach similar\nconclusions.\n\n15\n\n\fV.
