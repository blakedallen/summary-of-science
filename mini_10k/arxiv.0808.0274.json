The main advantage of\nthis equation is that it provides a physically transparent\nand mathematically tractable description of the stochastic dynamics of such systems. The Langevin approach is\nespecially effective if the noise that describes the action\nof the environment on the system can be represented as\na time derivative, in the sense of generalized functions,\nof a stationary process with independent increments on\nnon-overlapping intervals. In this case the solutions of the\nLangevin equation belong to the class of Markov processes\nwhose properties are well known (see, e.g., Refs. [3,4,5,\n6]). The stationary processes with independent increments\nand zero initial state constitute a class of L\u00e9vy processes\n[7]. For brevity, we call the L\u00e9vy process, whose derivative\nproduces a given noise, the noise generating process.\nA large variety of physical, biological, financial and\nother systems is successfully described by the overdamped\nLangevin equation, i.e., the first-order stochastic differential equation. One of the main statistical characteristics of\nthese systems is the probability density of the solution of\nthis Langevin equation. If the noise results from the noise\ngenerating process, then the solution possesses the Markovian property and the probability density satisfies a closed\na\n\ne-mail: stdenis@pks.mpg.de\n\nequation. Sometimes this equation is called the differential\nChapman-Kolmogorov equation [8]. On the other hand, it\nis referred to as the Fokker-Planck equation for some particular cases. Specifically, a Gaussian distribution of the\nincrements of the noise generating process corresponds to\nthe ordinary Fokker-Planck equation [4,5,6], and heavytailed stable distributions to the fractional Fokker-Planck\nequation [9,10,11,12,13,14]. In order to capture these important cases, we call the closed equation for the probability density that corresponds to an arbitrary distribution\nof the increments the generalized Fokker-Planck equation.\nWe have shown recently [15] that for additive noise the\ngeneralized Fokker-Planck equation can be represented in\na unified way through the characteristic function of the\nnoise generating process. Since the form and coefficients\nof this equation depend fundamentally on the distribution of the increments of the noise generating process, it\nprovides a useful tool for studying the effects of different\nnoises.\nThe aim of this paper is twofold. The first is to derive the generalized Fokker-Planck equation that corresponds to the overdamped Langevin equation driven by\nmultiplicative noise with an arbitrary distribution of the\nincrements of the noise generating process. The second is\nto solve this equation for specific cases and, on this basis,\nto study the distinctive effects of different noises on the\nsystem.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2 we discuss\nthe overdamped Langevin equation driven by multiplica-\n\n\f2\n\nS.I. Denisov, Werner Horsthemke, Peter H\u00e4nggi: Generalized Fokker-Planck equation: Derivation and exact solutions\n\ntive noise resulting from the noise generating process. In\nSect. 3 we derive the generalized Fokker-Planck equation\nassociated with this Langevin equation in terms of the\ntransition probability density and characteristic function\nof the noise generating process. To confirm the validity of\nthis equation, we consider in Sect. 4 various noises, including Poisson white and L\u00e9vy stable noises, for which the\ncorresponding generalized Fokker-Planck equations are\nknown. Several exact solutions of the generalized FokkerPlanck equation are derived in Sect. 5. In Sect. 6 we summarize our results.\n\n2 Overdamped Langevin equation\nThe temporal evolution of the relevant degrees of freedom\nof dynamical systems that interact with a fluctuating environment is often described by the (dimensionless) overdamped Langevin equation\n\u1e8b(t) = f (x(t), t) + g(x(t), t)\u03be(t).\n\n(1)\n\nFor different systems the variables in this equation have\ndifferent meanings, but to be concrete we will call x(t)\n[x(0) = 0] a particle coordinate, f (x, t) = \u2212\u2202U (x, t)/\u2202x a\nforce field, U (x, t) an external deterministic potential, \u03be(t)\na random force (noise) resulting from a fluctuating environment, and g(x, t) a multiplicative noise term. Under\ncertain conditions (see, e.g., Refs. [4,16]) the 'real' noise\n\u03be(t) with finite correlation time can be approximated by\nan idealized noise that effectively captures all the essential\nnoise effects and turns x(t) into a Markov process, with\nthe result that many of these effects can be described analytically.\nBecause of the singular character of the idealized noise,\nequation (1) has to be interpreted with care. The starting point relies on the fact [17] that this noise is the time\nderivative, in the sense of generalized functions, of the\nnoise generating process \u03b7(t). According to this, the increment \u03b4\u03b7(t) = \u03b7(t + \u03c4 ) \u2212 \u03b7(t) of \u03b7(t) is defined as the\nR t+\u03c4\ntime integral, \u03b4\u03b7(t) = t dt\u2032 \u03be(t\u2032 ), in the sense of convergence in distribution. Therefore, the increment \u03b4x(t) =\nx(t + \u03c4 ) \u2212 x(t) of the particle coordinate during a time\ninterval \u03c4 (\u03c4 \u2192 0) can be written in the form\n\u03b4x(t) = f (x(t), t)\u03c4 + g(x(t), t)\u03b4\u03b7(t),\n\n(2)\n\nwhich defines the meaning of equation (1) in the Ito interpretation [18] (see also Refs. [2,4,5,6]).\nFor a fixed \u03c4 , the distribution of the increments \u03b4\u03b7(j\u03c4 )\n(j = 0, 1, 2, . . .) is completely described by the transition\nprobability density p(\u03b7j+1 , \u03c4 |\u03b7j ), where \u03b7j+1 and \u03b7j denote the possible values of \u03b7(j\u03c4 + \u03c4 ) and \u03b7(j\u03c4R), respec\u221e\ntively. These densities are properly normalized, \u2212\u221e d\u03b7j+1\n\u00d7 p(\u03b7j+1 , \u03c4 |\u03b7j ) = 1, and satisfy the following condition\nlim\u03c4 \u21920 p(\u03b7j+1 , \u03c4 |\u03b7j ) = \u03b4(\u2206\u03b7), where \u03b4(*) stands for the\nDirac \u03b4 function and \u2206\u03b7 = \u03b7j+1 \u2212 \u03b7j . Moreover, if the\nfirst Rmoment of \u03b7(j\u03c4 + \u03c4 ) exists, it is assumed to be zero,\n\u221e\ni.e., \u2212\u221e d\u03b7j+1 \u03b7j+1 p(\u03b7j+1 , \u03c4 |\u03b7j ) = 0.\n\nThe noise generating process, i.e., the stationary MarP[t/\u03c4 ]\u22121\nkov process \u03b7(t) = lim\u03c4 \u21920 j=0 \u03b4\u03b7(j\u03c4 ) with \u03b7(0) = 0\nand [t/\u03c4 ] denoting the integer part of t/\u03c4 , is also completely defined by the transition probability density\np(\u03b7j+1 , \u03c4 |\u03b7j ). We note in this regard that all transition\nprobability densities of the form p(\u03b7j+l , l\u03c4 |\u03b7j ) (l = 2, 3, . . .)\ncan be expressed through p(\u03b7j+1 , \u03c4 |\u03b7j ) by using the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation\n[3,4,5]. In particular, for l = 2\nR\u221e\nit yields p(\u03b7j+2 , 2\u03c4 |\u03b7j ) = \u2212\u221e d\u03b7j+1 p(\u03b7j+2 , \u03c4 |\u03b7j+1 )p(\u03b7j+1 ,\n\u03c4 |\u03b7j ). Thus, the statistical properties of solutions of the\nLangevin equation (1) can be characterized by p(\u03b7j+1 , \u03c4 |\u03b7j )\nas well. Next, for simplicity, we additionally assume that\np(\u03b7j+1 , \u03c4 |\u03b7j ) = p(\u2206\u03b7, \u03c4 ).\nIf, for example, the transition probability density is\nGaussian, i.e.,\n2\n\np(\u2206\u03b7, \u03c4 ) =\n\ne\u2212\u2206\u03b7 /(4D\u03c4 )\n\u221a\n,\n4\u03c0D\u03c4\n\n(3)\n\nPn\u22121\nthen \u03b7(n\u03c4 ) = j=0 \u03b4\u03b7(j\u03c4 ) is a discrete-time Wiener process, which is fully characterized by two parameters,\nh\u03b4\u03b7(j\u03c4 )i = 0,\n\nh\u03b4\u03b7(j\u03c4 ) \u03b4\u03b7(l\u03c4 )i = 2D\u03b4jl \u03c4.\n\n(4)\n\nThe angular brackets denote averaging over the increments \u03b4\u03b7(j\u03c4 ), and \u03b4nm is the Kronecker symbol. These formulas are the discrete-time versions of the mean h\u03be(t)i = 0\nand the correlation function h\u03be(t)\u03be(t\u2032 )i = 2D\u03b4(t \u2212 t\u2032 ) of a\nGaussian white noise \u03be(t) of intensity D. Thus equations\n(2) and (4) completely specify the Langevin equation (1)\ndriven by multiplicative Gaussian white noise [4].\nTo derive the Fokker-Planck equation, it is typically\nassumed that the first two moments of \u03b4\u03b7(j\u03c4 ) exist [3,\n6]. However, if p(\u2206\u03b7, \u03c4 ) is a heavy-tailed function of \u2206\u03b7,\nthen the second moment does not exist. In this case, the\nderivation of the Fokker-Planck equation that corresponds\nto the Langevin equation (1) must be based solely on equation (2). We emphasize that noises characterized by heavytailed transition probability densities p(\u2206\u03b7, \u03c4 ) differ qualitatively from those characterized by p(\u2206\u03b7, \u03c4 ) with finite\nvariances. Specifically, the latterR have a frequency inde\u221e\npendent power spectral density \u2212\u221e dt e\u2212i\u03c9t h\u03be(0)\u03be(t)i (\u03c9\nis the frequency) and consequently they are called white\nnoises. In contrast, the power spectrum of the former does\nnot exist. Nevertheless, they are a very useful tool for\nstudying an important class of random processes that exhibit rare but large jumps.\n\n3 Generalized Fokker-Planck equation\nWe define the probability density of the particle coordinate x(t) in the usual way:\nP (x, t) = h\u03b4(x \u2212 x(t))i.\n\n(5)\n\nTo derive the evolution equation for this probability density, we need to be able to express the average values of\n\n\fS.I.

Keeping in mind the above definition of averaging,\nhF (x(t))i means averaging F (x(t)) over all increments\n\u03b4\u03b7(j\u03c4 ) with j = 0, 1, . . . , [t/\u03c4 ] \u2212 1 and \u03c4 \u2192 0. It is obvious from equations (2) and (5) that the result can be\nrepresented as an average with respect to the distribution\nof x(t), i.e.,\nZ \u221e\nhF (x(t))i =\ndx F (x)P (x, t).\n(6)\n\u2212\u221e\n\nIn order to express hF (x(t), \u03b4\u03b7(t))i in terms of P (x, t),\nwe use a two-stage averaging procedure [19]. Since the\nvariables x(t) and \u03b4\u03b7(t) are statistically independent and\ndistributed according to the probability densities P (x, t)\nand p(\u2206\u03b7, \u03c4 ), respectively, we readily obtain\nZ \u221e\nZ \u221e\ndy F (x, y)p(y, \u03c4 ).\ndx P (x, t)\nhF (x(t), \u03b4\u03b7(t))i =\n\u2212\u221e\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n(7)\nTo proceed, we introduce the Fourier transform, Pk (t),\nof P (x, t) according to the formula\nZ \u221e\nF {u(x)} \u2261 uk =\ndx e\u2212ikx u(x),\n(8)\n\u2212\u221e\n\nand find, using definition (5), that Pk (t) = he\u2212ikx(t) i.\nEquation (2) implies that for \u03c4 \u2192 0 the increment of\nPk (t), i.e., \u03b4Pk = Pk (t + \u03c4 ) \u2212 Pk (t), can be written in\nthe form\n\u03b4Pk = \u2212ik\u03c4 he\u2212ikx(t) f (x(t), t)i\n+he\u2212ikx(t) (e\u2212ikg(x(t),t)\u03b4\u03b7(t) \u2212 1)i.\n\n(9)\n\nIn accordance with (6) and (8), the first term on the righthand side of equation (9) reduces to\n\u001b\n\u001a\n\u2202\nf (x, t)P (x, t) ,\n(10)\nikhe\u2212ikx(t) f (x(t), t)i = F\n\u2202x\nand equation (7) for the second term gives\nhe\u2212ikx(t) (e\u2212ikg(x(t),t)\u03b4\u03b7(t) \u2212 1)i\nZ \u221e\n=\ndy e\u2212iky [pkg(y,t) (\u03c4 ) \u2212 1]P (y, t),\n\n(11)\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\nwhere pk (\u03c4 ) = F {p(x, \u03c4 )} = he\u2212ik\u03b4\u03b7(t) i is the characteristic function of \u03b4\u03b7(t).\nSubstituting (10) and (11) into equation (9), dividing\nit by \u03c4 and taking the limit \u03c4 \u2192 0, we obtain the following\nequation:\n\u001a\n\u001b\n\u2202\n\u2202\nPk (t) = \u2212F\nf (x, t)P (x, t)\n\u2202t\n\u2202x\nZ \u221e\n+\ndy e\u2212iky \u03c6kg(y,t) P (y, t)\n(12)\n\u2212\u221e\n\n3\n\nwith\n\n1\n[pk (\u03c4 ) \u2212 1].\n(13)\n\u03c4\nSince the transition probability density p(\u2206\u03b7, \u03c4 ) is normalized, i.e., p0 (\u03c4 ) = 1, the limit (13) must satisfy the\ncondition \u03c60 = 0. If k 6= 0, then there exist three different cases, depending on how quickly pk (\u03c4 ) \u2212 1 tends to\nzero as \u03c4 \u2192 0. First, if pk (\u03c4 ) \u2212 1 = o(\u03c4 ), then \u03c6k = 0\nand the noise does not effect the system at all. Second,\nif pk (\u03c4 ) \u2212 1 tends to zero slower than \u03c4 , then |\u03c6k | = \u221e,\ni.e., the influence of the noise is so strong that the system relaxes instantaneously to the final state. Finally, the\ncase we are interested in corresponds to pk (\u03c4 ) \u2212 1 = O(\u03c4 ),\ni.e., 0 < |\u03c6\u03ba | < \u221e and the noise acts on the system in a\nnon-trivial way.\nWe apply the inverse Fourier transform, defined as\nZ \u221e\n1\n\u22121\ndk eikx uk ,\n(14)\nF {uk } \u2261 u(x) =\n2\u03c0 \u2212\u221e\n\u03c6k = lim\n\n\u03c4 \u21920\n\nto equation (12).

Therefore,\nthe desired generalized Fokker-Planck equation that corresponds to the Langevin equation (1) driven by multiplicative noise, which results from an arbitrary noise generating process, takes the form\n\u2202\n\u2202\nP (x, t) = \u2212 f (x, t)P (x, t)\n\u2202t\n\u2202x\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ \u221e\nP (y, t)\nx\u2212y\n.\ndy\n+\n\u03c6\n|g(y, t)|\ng(y, t)\n\u2212\u221e\n\n(17)\n\nIn accordance with the definition (5), the solution of this\nequation must be normalized and satisfy the initial condition P (x, 0) = \u03b4(x).\nTo gain more insight into the connection between the\ngeneralized Fokker-Planck equation and the properties of\nthe noise, we introduce the characteristic function Sk =\nhe\u2212ik\u03b7(1) i of the noise generating process \u03b7(t) at t = 1.\nP[1/\u03c4 ]\u22121\n\u03b4\u03b7(j\u03c4 ), it can\nWith the formula \u03b7(1) = lim\u03c4 \u21920 j=0\nbe rewritten as Sk = lim\u03c4 \u21920 (pk (\u03c4 ))[1/\u03c4 ] .

[15].\nWe note that the problem of deriving the generalized\nFokker-Planck equation that corresponds to the Langevin\nequation (1) has been considered earlier in terms of the\nL\u00e9vy measure of the noise generating process [20,21,22,\n23]. In contrast, the generalized Fokker-Planck equations\n(18) and (20) are derived here in terms of the characteristic\nfunction Sk of this process at t = 1. Since the stationary\nprocesses with independent increments are infinitely divisible, ln Sk can be represented by the L\u00e9vy-Khintchine formula that connects Sk with the L\u00e9vy measure [7]. Hence,\nboth approaches are, in fact, equivalent and lead to different forms of the generalized Fokker-Planck (see also Sect.\n4.5). It seems, however, that the above approach which\ndeals with the transition probability density of the noise\ngenerating process is more convenient for applications.\nIndeed, the transition probability density completely describes the noise generating process and, in accordance\nwith (13) and Sk = e\u03c6k , explicitly represents the characteristic function Sk . At the same time, there is no simple\nway to invert the L\u00e9vy-Khintchine formula, i.e., to express\nthe L\u00e9vy measure through Sk [24].\n\n4 Special cases of the generalized\nFokker-Planck equation\nIn order to confirm the validity of equations (17), (18)\nand (20) and to demonstrate their usefulness, we consider\nseveral specific noises for which the corresponding FokkerPlanck equations associated with the Langevin equation\n(1) are already known.\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n= \u2212DF \u22121 {k 2 F {g 2 (x, t)P (x, t)}}\n=D\n\n\u22022 2\ng (x, t)P (x, t).\n\u2202x2\n\n(22)\n\nApplying the inverse Fourier transform to equation (12)\nand using the above result, we again obtain the ordinary\nFokker-Planck equation [4,5,6]\n\u2202\n\u22022\n\u2202\nP (x, t) = \u2212 f (x, t)P (x, t) + D 2 g 2 (x, t)P (x, t),\n\u2202t\n\u2202x\n\u2202x\n(23)\nwhich corresponds to the Ito interpretation of the Langevin equation (1) driven by multiplicative Gaussian white\nnoise. We note that the last equation can also be derived\nfrom equation (17) with \u03c6(*) = D\u2202 2 \u03b4(*)/\u2202x2 for this case.\n4.2 Poisson white noise\nAs a second example we consider Poisson white noise, i.e.,\na random sequence of \u03b4-pulses, defined as [25,26]\n\u03be(t) =\n\nn(t)\nX\ni=1\n\nzi \u03b4(t \u2212 ti ).\n\n(24)\n\nHere n(t) is a Poisson counting process with the probability P (n(t) = n) = (\u03bbt)n e\u2212\u03bbt /n! of n \u2265 0 arrivals in\nthe interval (0, t], \u03bb is the rate of the process, ti are the\n(random) arrival times of this process, and zi are independent random variables of zero mean distributed with\nthe same probability density q(z). It is assumed also that\n\u03be(t) = 0 if n(t) = 0.

Accordingly, pk (\u03c4 ) =\n2\n2\ne\u2212D\u03c4 k , \u03c6k = \u2212Dk 2 , and Sk = e\u2212Dk . Then, taking into\naccount that F \u22121 {Pk (t)k 2 } = \u2212\u2202 2 P (x, t)/\u2202x2 , we find\nthat in the case of additive Gaussian white noise equation (20) reduces indeed to the ordinary Fokker-Planck\nequation [4,5,6]\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u22022\nP (x, t) = \u2212 f (x, t)P (x, t) + D 2 P (x, t).\n\u2202t\n\u2202x\n\u2202x\n\nIf the Gaussian white noise is multiplicative, then\n\u03c6kg(y,t) = \u2212Dk 2 g 2 (y, t) and\n\u001aZ \u221e\n\u001b\nF \u22121\ndy e\u2212iky \u03c6kg(y,t) P (y, t)\n\n(21)\n\n(26)\n\nThe first term on the right-hand side of this formula is the\nprobability density of \u03b4\u03b7(t) under the condition that none\nof the \u03b4-pulses occurred during the time interval \u03c4 .

Taking the probabilities Pn (\u03c4 ) = P (n(\u03c4 ) = n) with\nlinear accuracy in \u03c4 , i.e., P0 (\u03c4 ) = 1 \u2212 \u03bb\u03c4 , P1 (\u03c4 ) = \u03bb\u03c4 , and\nPn\u22652 (\u03c4 ) = 0, we obtain from formulas (26) and (27)\np(\u2206\u03b7, \u03c4 ) = (1 \u2212 \u03bb\u03c4 ) \u03b4(\u2206\u03b7) + \u03bb\u03c4 q(\u2206\u03b7).\n\n(28)\n\nIn accordance with the definition (16), for this probability density \u03c6(x) = \u03bb[q(x) \u2212 \u03b4(x)], and the generalized\nFokker-Planck equation (17) reads\n\u2202\n\u2202\nP (x, t) = \u2212 f (x, t)P (x, t) \u2212 \u03bbP (x, t)\n\u2202t\n\u2202x\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ \u221e\nP (y, t)\nx\u2212y\n.\n+\u03bb\ndy\nq\n|g(y, t)|\ng(y, t)\n\u2212\u221e\n\n(29)\n\nFor g(x, t) = 1, i.e., in the case of additive Poisson white\nnoise, this equation is consistent with those reported previously [25,26,27,28]. Of course, since Sk = e\u2212\u03bb(1\u2212qk ) ,\nq(x) = F \u22121 {qk } and \u03b4(x) = F \u22121 {1}, the same form of\nthe equation (29) (with g(x, t) = 1) follows from equation\n(20) as well. We note that a wide class of white noises,\nwhich are represented by random sequences of \u03b4-pulses\nwith a mean number \u03bb of pulses per unit time, is characterized by the same transition probability density (28).\nTherefore, the generalized Fokker-Planck equation (29) is\nalso valid for all these noises.\n4.3 Compound noise\nPM\n\nNext we consider the noise \u03be(t) = m=1 \u03bem (t) composed\nof a set of independent noises \u03bem (t).

It is well\nknown [30] that Sk (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3, \u03c1) depends on four parameters: an index of stability \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 2], a skewness parameter\n\u03b2 \u2208 [\u22121, 1], a scale parameter \u03b3 \u2208 (0, \u221e), and a location\nparameter \u03c1 \u2208 (\u2212\u221e, \u221e). Assuming in accordance with\nthe initial condition P (x, 0) = \u03b4(x) that \u03c1 = 0 and excluding from consideration the singular case when \u03b1 = 1\nand \u03b2 6= 0 simultaneously (in this case |\u03c6k | = \u221e), we\nobtain Sk = Sk (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3), where [30]\n\u0010\nh\n\u03c0\u03b1 \u0011i\n.\nSk (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3) = exp \u2212\u03b3|k|\u03b1 1 + i\u03b2 sgn(k) tan\n2\n(33)\nIn the following we assume for simplicity that the condition g(y, t) > 0 holds for all y and t.

This provides a unique opportunity to\nstudy in detail the effect of different noises on the same\nsystem. In Sects. 5.1 and 5.2, we consider this problem\nfor overdamped particles in linear and quadratic potentials, respectively. The stationary solution of the generalized Fokker-Planck equation (18) in the case of multiplicative L\u00e9vy stable noise and a tailored potential is presented\nin Sect. 5.3.\n\n5.1 Linear potential\nIn this case U (x, t) = U (x) = \u2212f0 x (f0 is a constant force\nacting on a particle) and, since F {\u2202f (x, t)P (x, t)/\u2202x} =\nikf0 Pk (t), equation (12) becomes\n\u2202\nPk (t) = (\u2212ikf0 + \u03c6k )Pk (t).\n\u2202t\n\n\u0012\ndy \u03b4[x \u2212 y \u2212 zg(y, t)]\n\n\u0013\n\u2202\n\u2212 \u03b4(x \u2212 y) + sin z g(x, t)\u03b4(x \u2212 y) P (y, t).\n\u2202x\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nn=0\n\nand\n\n+ \u03b3\u03b2 tan\n\n\u2212\u221e\n\n=\n\nWith the help of this definition and the relations\n\u03c0\u03b1 \u22121\n\u03b1\n(\u221e D+\n+ \u221e D\u2212 )h(x) = 2 cos\nF {|k|\u03b1 hk }\n2\n\nEvaluating the integral over y and using the formula\nZ \u221e\ndy \u03b4[x \u2212 y \u2212 zg(y, t)]P (y, t)\n\n(49)\n\nThe solution of this equation, satisfying the initial condition Pk (0) = 1 that follows from the initial condition\nP (x, 0) = \u03b4(x), is given by\n(46)\n\nPk (t) = exp(\u2212ikf0 t + \u03c6k t).\n\n(50)\n\n\fS.I. Denisov, Werner Horsthemke, Peter H\u00e4nggi: Generalized Fokker-Planck equation: Derivation and exact solutions\n\nTherefore, using the relation Sk = e\u03c6k , we can write the\nsolution of the generalized Fokker-Planck equation (20) as\nP (x, t) = F\n\n\u22121\n\n{Skt e\u2212iktf0 }.\n\n(51)\n\nIn order to study how the behavior of free particles,\nwhen f0 = 0, depends on the character Rof the noise, we\n\u221e\ncalculate the second moment hx2 (t)i = \u2212\u221e dx x2 P (x, t)\nof the particle coordinate x(t). Using theR solution (51)\n\u221e\nand the integral formula \u03b4 \u2032\u2032 (k) = \u2212(1/2\u03c0) \u2212\u221e dx x2 eikx ,\nwe obtain\nd2\n.\n(52)\nhx2 (t)i = \u2212 2 Skt\ndk\nk=0\nSince in the case of free particles x(t) = \u03b7(t), we have Sk =\nPk (1), and the normalization of P (x, t) yields S0 = 1.\nMoreover, if the first moment of x(t) exists, it is assumed\nto be zero, i.e., dSk /dk|k=0 = 0. With these conditions,\nformula (52) reduces to\nhx2 (t)i = hx2 (1)i t.\n\n(53)\n\nIf the term hx2 (1)i, which can be represented as\n\u0002 P[1/\u03c4 ]\u22121\n\u00032\nhx2 (1)i = lim\u03c4 \u21920 h\n\u03b4\u03b7(j\u03c4 ) i = lim\u03c4 \u21920 h\u03b4\u03b7 2 (0)i/\u03c4\nj=0\nR\n\u221e\nwith h\u03b4\u03b7 2 (0)i = h[\u03b7(\u03c4 )\u2212\u03b7(0)]2 i = \u2212\u221e dy y 2 p(y, \u03c4 ), exists,\ni.e., h\u03b4\u03b7 2 (0)i = O(\u03c4 ), then the noise is white and leads to\nnormal diffusion of particles. In particular, Rhx2 (t)i = 2Dt\n\u221e\nfor Gaussian white noise, and hx2 (t)i = \u03bb t \u2212\u221e dy y 2 q(y)\nfor Poisson white noise. If the transition probability density p(\u2206\u03b7, \u03c4 ) has heavy tails, i.e., h\u03b4\u03b7 2 (0)i = \u221e, then\nP (x, t) evolves in such a way that hx2 (t)i does not exist.\nSuch behavior is displayed, e.g., by the probability density P (x, t) = F \u22121 {Skt (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3)} of free particles driven\nby L\u00e9vy stable noise with \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 2) [9]. While correlated\nnoise induces a variety of different diffusion regimes of\nfree particles [32], noise resulting from the noise generating process can only give rise to normal diffusive behavior\n(if h\u03b4\u03b7 2 (0)i < \u221e) or to non-diffusive behavior, characterized by a probability density P (x, t) with infinite second\nmoment (if h\u03b4\u03b7 2 (0)i = \u221e).\n\nReplacing k by ke\u2212bt in this relation, we obtain\n\u0012\n\n1\n\u03a8\nln |k| + c2 \u2212 t\nb\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\nPk (t) + bk Pk (t) = Pk (t)\u03c6k .\n\u2202t\n\u2202k\n\n(54)\n\nIts general solution can be obtained via the method of\ncharacteristics [33], for example, and reads\n\u0012 Z k\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\n1\n1\n\u03c6z\nPk (t) = exp\nln |k|+c2 \u2212t , (55)\ndz +c1 \u03a8\nb 0\nz\nb\nwhere \u03a8 (x) is an arbitrary function, and c1 and c2 are\nconstants of integration.
