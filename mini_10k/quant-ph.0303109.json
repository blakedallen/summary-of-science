Introduction Squeezed states of a radiation field\nare nonclassical states whose field-quadrature noise is\nphase dependent with a minimum below the shot noise\nlevel. First investigated theoretically [1] and generated\nexperimentally [2, 3] in the 1980's, these states awoke\ninitial interest as a way of overcoming the shot-noise\nprecision restrictions in optical measurements [4, 5] and\nenhancing the capacity of communication channels [6].\nFurther interest to squeezed light was triggered by recent advances in the field of quantum information and\ncommunication. In this context they are viewed primarily as a means of generating quadrature entanglement\n[7], a valuable resource that can be applied, for example,\nfor quantum teleportation [8], computation [9], cryptography [10] and manipulation of atomic quantum states\n[11]. Protocols of error correction [12, 13] and entanglement purification [14] have been elaborated, establishing continuous variable entanglement as one of the most\npromising tools for quantum information technology.\nA number of techniques for producing squeezed states\nof light have been developed, using for instance four wave\nmixing in atomic vapor [15], Kerr effect in cold atoms [16]\nor optical fibers [17, 18], optical parametric amplifiers [3].\nAll these methods require rather complicated setups that\ncannot be scaled easily, effectively preventing their practical application for the quantum information purposes.\nIn the present paper we demonstrate a simple, scalable\nsqueezed vacuum source which consists in essence of a\ncontinuous-wave (cw) diode laser and an atomic rubidium vapor cell. Easy and inexpensive generation of multiple Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-entangled modes lies at\nhand, making them available to a variety of experiments\nand applications.\nWe make use of a phenomenon known as cross-phase\nmodulation squeezing [19]: if linearly polarized light\npropagates through a nonlinear medium in which elliptical light would undergo polarization self-rotation, the orthogonal vacuum mode gets squeezed. Self-rotation and\nthe associated squeezing effect are present in any Kerr\nmedium but are especially strong in atomic vapor due to\nits large optical nonlinearity near resonance. To achieve\nsqueezing it is sufficient to use a moderately intense cw\n\n\u2217 URL:\n\nhttp://www.uni-konstanz.de/quantum-optics/quantech/\n\nPx\n\nPx\n\nXx\n\nXx\n\nFIG. 1: Transformation of the phase space: a Wigner function\ndescribing the state of the probe field in the mode polarized\northogonally to the strong pump beam.

The circular\nphase-space quasiprobability density describing the vacuum\nstate is transformed into squeezed vacuum.\n\ndiode laser as a pump. Pulsed lasers or cavities are not\nneeded and the diode laser does not even have to be frequency stabilized.\nb. Theory The theory of squeezing via polarization\nself-rotation for the single mode case has been given\nin Ref. [20]. Here we present its brief quasiclassical\noverview. A detailed multimode description including\nthe degrading effects of resonance fluorescence, phase\nmismatch and absorption will be published elsewhere.\nInteraction with an elliptically polarized light field can\ncause an initially isotropic \u03c7(3) -nonlinear medium to become circularly birefringent: the two circular components\nof different intensities propagate with different phase velocities. Specifically in atomic vapor, the mechanisms\nleading to this birefringence include optical pumping, ac\nStark shifts, as well as ac Stark shift induced quantum\nbeats and Bennett structures [21]. Propagating through\na cell of length l, the polarization ellipse of light will rotate by an angle \u03c6 which is proportional to the ellipticity\n\u01eb \u226a 1:\n\u03c6 = gl\u01eb,\n\n(1)\n\nwith the self-rotation parameter g dependent on the incident light intensity and frequency.\nConsider a monochromatic, elliptically polarized light\nfield of frequency \u03c9 propagating in the z-direction. The\ncomplex field amplitudes in the two linear polarization\ncomponents are given by Ex and Ey , with |Ex | \u226a |Ey |.\nAssuming the \"pump\" amplitude Ey real, we decompose the \"probe\" x-field into two real quadrature components in and out of phase with the pump field:\n\n\f2\nEx (z) = Xx (z) + iPx (z).\nlaser light is given by\n\u01eb\u2248\n\nThen the ellipticity \u01eb of the\nPx (z)\n.\nEy (z)\n\nSpectrum\nanalyzer\n\nDiode\nlaser\n\nThe resulting self-rotation by \u03c6 \u226a 1 causes the pump\nfield to contribute its fraction \u03c6Ey into the x-polarization,\nnamely into the Xx quadrature which is in phase with Ey :\n(3)\n(4)\n\nEy and \u01eb remain effectively unchanged.\nWe now assume the x-polarized light field as classical noise described by a probability distribution in the\nquadrature plane (Fig. 1). To describe slow fluctuations,\nwe regard the propagation of a light field described by\nXx (z), Px (z) and Ey through the medium under stationary conditions. A random quadrature component Px (0)\nresults in a small random ellipticity according to Eq. (2).\nThe propagation through the cell will displace the point\n(Xx , Px ) in the phase space as described in Eqs. (3) and\n(4). The phase space probability distribution experiences\na linear shear, resulting in reduction of the noise in some\nphase quadratures below the original level.\nAlthough the above treatment is purely classical, it\nis completely identical in application to the quantum\nquadrature noise. Considering the Heisenberg evolution of the field-quadrature operators X\u0302x (z) and P\u0302x (z)\nwe notice that the evolution described by Eqs. (3) and\n(4) can be associated with the interaction Hamiltonian\n\u0124 = h\u0304gcP\u0302x2 /2, c being the speed of light in the medium.\nUnder a second order Hamiltonian, each point of the\nWigner function - the quantum-mechanical analogue of\nthe phase-space probability distribution - evolves according to the classical equations of motion [22]. The incoming symmetric Gaussian Wigner function of the vacuum is therefore transformed into an elliptical Wigner\nfunction of a minimum uncertainty squeezed vacuum\nstate.\nIn a homodyne measurement such a state results in a\nquadrature noise depending on the local oscillator phase\n\u03c7 (cf. [20]):\n2\n\nh\u2206Ex (\u03c7, l) i\n(5)\n2\n\u0001\nE\n= 0 (1 \u2212 \u03b1l)(1 \u2212 2gl sin \u03c7 cos \u03c7 + g 2 l2 cos2 \u03c7) + \u03b1l .\n4\nE2\n\nHere 40 is the standard quantum noise limit (SQL) associated with the vacuum state, and we have taken into\naccount absorption of a small fraction \u03b1l \u226a 1 of the\nsqueezed light after passing the medium. This treatment\nof absorption is approximate because some of the light\nenergy is actually lost in the atomic vapor along the propagation path. However, it permits to account for one essential feature of our experimental result: the minimum\nuncertainty property is lost when gl > 0 and \u03b1l > 0.\n\nRb cell\n\nl/4\n\nl/2\n\nf = 800 mm\n\nBS\n\nHomodyne\nlocal\noscillator detector\n\n(2)\nPBS\n\nXx (l) = Xx (0) + \u03c6Ey = Xx (0) + glPx (0)\nPx (l) = Px (0),\n\nsqueezed\nvacuum\n\ndouble m-metal\noptical magnetic shielding\ndiode\nand oven\n\nPBS\n\nl/2\n\npiezo\n\nFIG. 2: Experimental setup.

Experimental apparatus The scheme of our experimental setup is shown in Fig. 2. A free running\nexternal cavity diode laser (Toptica DL-100) delivered\n35 mW of optical power in a single mode at a wavelength\nof 780 nm, tunable across the rubidium D2 line. The\nbeam was shaped with a pair of cylindrical lenses and a\npolarizing beam splitter (PBS) purified the linear polarization. The beam was focused by a lens (f = 800 mm)\ninto a heated and magnetically shielded 75 mm rubidium\ncell which had optical quality anti-reflection coated windows and was filled with the nearly pure isotope 87 Rb.\nWith a focal beam diameter of 600 \u03bcm we operated in a\nhigh saturation regime.\nTo determine the polarization self-rotation parameter\ngl a fine-adjustable \u03bb/4 plate was placed in front of the\ncell. Its rotation angle in radians was equal to the generated ellipticity \u01eb. The outputs of the second PBS were directly fed into two photodiodes. A \u03bb/2 plate placed after\nthe cell was adjusted so that the DC photodiode signals\nS1 and S2 were exactly equal when the laser was detuned\nfar from the resonance. This \"balanced polarimeter\" was\nsensitive to the polarization ellipse rotation while being\ninsensitive to changes in ellipticity. The rotation angle\n\u03c6 \u226a 1 can be determined from the photodiode signal\ndifference [21]:\n\u03c6=\n\nS1 \u2212 Ss\n2(S1 + S2 )\n\n(6)\n\nBy recording S1 and S2 while scanning over the rubidium D2 line for many different initial small ellipticities\n\u01eb \u226a 1, the self-rotation parameter gl for each laser detuning was determined by polynomial fitting. Fig. 3 shows gl\nand the absorption coefficient \u03b1l for our working temperature of 70\u25e6 C. Note that a relatively high transmission\non resonance is due to very high saturation of the atomic\ntransition - in the linear small signal regime, the rubidium vapor is optically dense.\nTo measure the quantum field quadrature noise we employed the standard balanced homodyne detection technique.

The two main features correspond to the hyperfine levels of the 87 Rb ground state. The hyperfine structure of the\nexcited state is not resolved because it is narrower than both\nDoppler and power broadening. The \"side lobes\" around 1\nand 4 GHz are attributed to some content of the 85 Rb isotope. Zero detuning corresponds to the maximum absorption\npoint.\n\nemerging from the cell was used as the local oscillator.\nTo this end it was first separated from the x-polarized\nprobe mode by means of a polarizing beam splitter and\nits polarization was rotated by 90\u25e6 . It was then overlapped with the squeezed mode on a symmetric beam\nsplitter. To achieve good mode matching, an auxiliary\n\u03bb/2 plate placed directly after the cell was set to provide\nequal splitting into both polarization modes. The resulting Mach-Zehnder interferometer was carefully aligned\nfor a maximum visibility of V = 0.98 \u00b1 0.01 corresponding to a mode matching efficiency of V 2 \u2248 0.96. The\nauxiliary \u03bb/2 plate was then removed.\nA piezoelectric element was used to scan the local oscillator phase and thus the field quadrature whose fluctuations were measured. The intensities at the beam splitter\noutputs were measured with Si PIN photodiodes (Hamamatsu S3883 with a nominal quantum efficiency of 91%).\nThe AC signals of the diodes were amplified with a low\nnoise amplifier with a cutoff frequency of approximately\n50 MHz and subtracted by a hybrid junction (H-9 from\nM/A-COM). The noise was measured with a spectrum\nanalyzer operated in the zero span mode at a set of radio\nfrequencies \u03a9RF between 3 and 30 MHz with a resolution\nbandwidth of 1 MHz.\nd. Results and discussion The squeezing homodyne\nmeasurements were performed at a finite radio-frequency\n\u03a9RF , as usual, because of the high optical and electronic\nnoise near DC.

The geometric\nmean noise of the squeezed mode, however, strongly exceeds the SQL so the observed ensemble is not a minimum\nuncertainty state. The excess noise cannot be explained\nby absorption alone and is presumably due to resonance\nfluorescence into the optical mode probed.\nFig. 5 shows the squeezing as a function of the laser\ndetuning and the radio frequency \u03a9RF . The variation\nof squeezing with the laser detuning follows approximately the self-rotation curve in Fig. 3. For small \u03a9RF\nthe squeezing is reduced due to extra noise from resonance fluorescence which scatters light into our vacuum\nmode. This extra noise was measured by misaligning the\nmode matching until the phase dependence vanished and\nmaximizing the spatial overlap between the pump and\nprobe modes in the cell by maximizing the noise. Fig. 6\nshows the extra noise normalized to the vacuum noise.\nIts spectral width approximates the natural linewidth of\n\u0393 = 6 MHz [23], its dependence on the laser detuning is\nsimilar to the absorption line (Fig. 3). For \u03a9RF \u226b \u0393 the\nexcess noise becomes negligible. Maximum squeezing is\nachieved for \u03a9RF \u223c 5 MHz to 10 MHz. The reason for the\nsqueezing to degrade with higher \u03a9RF might be a growing phase mismatch between the pump and the probe\nexpected in the neighborhood of an atomic resonance.\ne. Summary and outlook We reported the generation of squeezed optical vacuum states in rubidium vapor with a simple setup. A squeezing of 0.85 dB was\nachieved which is among the best atomic vapor squeezing results accomplished. The squeezing of 6 to 8 dB\npredicted in [20] was not reached due to the degrading\neffects of self-focusing, phase mismatch and resonance\n\n\f4\n30\n\n0.4\n\n30\n\n25\n\n0.2\n\n25\n\n4.5\n4\n\n20\n-0.2\n15\n\n-0.4\n-0.6\n\n10\n\nWRF [MHz]\n\nWRF [Mhz]\n\n0\n\n3.5\n\n20\n\n3\n15\n2.5\n2\n\n10\n\n-0.8\n5\n-1\n-0.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\nlaser detuning [GHz]\n\n1.5\n5\n-0.5\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1\n\nlaser detuning [GHz]\n\nFIG. 5: Minimum quadrature noise level relative to the SQL\n(in dB) for a range of radio frequencies \u03a9RF and laser detunings across one hyperfine component of the rubidium D2 line.\nThe electronic noise has been subtracted.\n\nFIG. 6: Excess noise due to resonance fluorescence on a\nlinear scale, in units of the vacuum noise for a range of radio\nfrequencies \u03a9RF and laser detunings.

Further theoretical investigation of these\neffects will help us optimize the experimental parameters.\nThe self-rotation parameter and the associated squeezing\nmight increase by using a cell with a moderate amount of\nbuffer gas [24]. We are optimistic that a noticeable improvement of the squeezing is possible. By splitting the\nlaser and directing it into several rubidium cells, numer-\n\nous squeezed states, which are phase locked with respect\nto each other, can be generated easily.\nf.
