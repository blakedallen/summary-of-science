Quantum game[2] is an interesting subject and remains in the realm of the unknown in potential\ncapacities. Two schemes for quantum games mainly have been proposed so far. One has been proposed by Eisert\net al. [3] where the strategy space of players is a two parameter set of 2 \u00d7 2 matrices and Prisoners Dilemma\nwas discussed. It is shown that starting with maximally entangled initial state, the dilemma disappears for\na suitable quantum strategy. Moreover they pointed out that a quantum strategy displays its superiority to\nall the classical strategies. The details of this scheme were also reviewed by Rosero [4]. Another one has been\nintroduced by Marinatto and Weber [5] applying it to the game of Battle of Sexes. In their scheme, starting with\nmaximally entangled initial state, the players are allowed to apply the probabilistic tactics of unitary operators.\nAs result, they found the strategy for which both the players can get equal payoffs. Recently two schemes could\nbe studied by a unified way[8]. Two schemes are one aspect of the generalized quantization scheme developed\nby Nazawa and Toor[8]. Furthermore, the scheme was extended to three-player quantum games by Ramzan\nand Khan[9].\nQuantum game theory is not only a tool to resolve a dilemma in some games and find better payoffs than\nones of classical strategies, but also it has more potential ability and will provide wide types of communication\nprotocols. For further details, you can consult the article given by Iqbal[6]. In fact Ramzan and Khan studied\nan interesting aspects of communication based on three-player quantum Prisoner's Dilemma[9]. Moreover\nthe authors investigated a cryptographic protocol based on a scheme of the generalized three-player quantum\ngame[10].\nIn classical cryptography in 20-th century, key distribution that generates a private key in a secure way\nbetween two or several remote parties is an important subject. In public key crypto-systems such as RivestShamir-Adelman(RSA)[11], the receiver generates a pair of keys; a public key and a private key. The security\nof the communication relies on the difficulty to factorize a large integer into some prime numbers. The public\nkey is used to encrypt the message by a sender, while the private one is used for a receiver to decrypt it. But\nit has been proved that quantum algorithm can solve the factorization problem in polynomial time[12]. On\nthe other hand, quantum information theory itself provides some ways of quantum key distribution (QKD).\nFirst protocol was proposed by Bennet and Brassard[13]. After that Eckert proposed a different approach to\nQKD[14]. Many protocols are developed as of today[15].\nInspired by a series of researches, we propose a new kind of communication scheme based on three-player\nquantum game in this paper. We mainly study QKD that is different from the scheme proposed [10], though it\nessentially takes our ground on three-player quantum games and Greenberg-Horne-Zeilinger triplet entangled\n\n1\n\n\fstate (GHZ state) [16] is used. In the scheme of [10], Alice finds messages sent from Bob and Charlie by making\na measurement of the qubits that are manipulated by their unitary operators. In our scheme proposed in this\npaper, Bob and Charlie (and Alice also) get some common key or information by knowing the some information\nof the measurement made by Alice. In [9] where the quantum version of Prisoner's Dilemma game is adopted,\nBob and Charlie can extract information about the strategy applied by Alice from their payoffs by mutual\nunderstanding that they will apply the same strategy. This protocol stands as an information communication\nrather than QKD because this assumes the mutual understanding. The information about payoffs in [9] is\nbrought by an arbiter. On the contrary there are not any arbiters in our scheme. Existence of an arbiter\nincrease the risk of wiretapping, because when an arbiter sends classical information, but not quantum state,\nto Bob and Charlie, it is difficult to detect wiretapping. As it is better that there are not any arbiters in a\nprotocol in view of wiretapping, an arbiter is excluded in our scheme. In the proposed protocol here, a scheme\nthat Bob and Charlie (and Alice) can get some information (key) by results obtained from Alice's experiment\nand it can be made in the secrecy from other people. Thus it provides a sort of QKD. In fact Bob and Charlie\n(and Alice) can extract other people's full information (applied strategies and their payoffs) theoretically by\nthe information shown by Alice. We show that methods using an entangled state and a non-entangled state\nessentially equivalent as QKD but a method using partially entangled state give a different one from the formers\nin the protocol.\nLastly we discuss robustness for eavesdrop. We show that though maximally entangled case and nonentangled case provide an essentially equivalent way as QKD, the latter is not available in the case there are\nany eavesdroppers.\n\n2\n\nFramework of Quantum Game\n\nThe protocol proposed in this paper is based on three-player quantum games. Three players are Alice , Bob\nand Charlie following custom in this field. As result of the game, three player find other players' strategies and\npayoffs after Alice revealed some information to Bob and Charlie about the result of the quantum game. First\nof all we describe the framework of quantum games.\nBasically we follow the generalized formalism of quantum games proposed by Nawaz and Toor [8] and its\nextension given by Ramzan and Khan [9]. In scheme of this paper, Alice, Bob and Charlie can choose one\namong two strategies F and T, respectively. We express the strategies F as 0 and T as 1, respectively and a set\nof strategies of three players as (0,0,1) for example. The set of strategies (0,0,1) denotes that Alice applies the\nstrategy F, Bob does F and Charlie does T.\nFirst Alice prepares an initial quantum state that consists of three qubits and passes second qubit and third\none to Bob and Charlie, respectively. Bob and Charlie accept one qubit, respectively and Alice keeps remaining\none qubit that is first qubit. We suppose the initial quantum state shared among three players is the generalized\nGHZ state;\n\u03b3\n\u03b3\n|\u03c8in >= cos |000 > +i sin |111 >,\n(1)\n2\n2\nwhere 0 \u2265 \u03b3 \u2265 \u03c0/2. There is no entanglement for \u03b3 = 0 and the case of \u03b3 = \u03c0/2 denotes maximally entangled\nstate that has the largest von Neumann entropy.\nNext the players locally manipulate their individual qubits by some unitary operators; Alice, Bob and Charlie\nmake the unitary transformations on the first qubit, the second qubit and third qubit, respectively. The classical\nstrategies F and T are assigned to the two basis vectors |0 > and |1 > in the Hilbert space, respectively. The\nstrategies of the players are represented by the unitary operator Uk defined by [8]\nUk = cos\n\n\u03b8k\n\u03b8k\nRk + sin Qk ,\n2\n2\n\n(2)\n\nwhere k = A(Alice), B(Bob) and C(Charlie), and Rk and Qk are unitary operators defined by\nRk |1 >= e\u2212i\u03b1k |1 >,\n\nRk |0 >= ei\u03b1k |0 >,\n\nQk |0 >= e\n\ni( \u03c0\n2 \u2212\u03b2k )\n\n\u03c0\n\n|1 >, Qk |1 >= ei( 2 +\u03b2k ) |0 >,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere 0 \u2264 \u03b8k \u2264 \u03c0, and \u2212\u03c0 \u2264 \u03b1k , \u03b2k \u2264 \u03c0. After applying the local operators of three players, the density matrix\nof the initial state \u03c1in = |\u03c8in >< \u03c8in | changes to\nO\nO\nO\nO\n\u03c1f = (UA\nUB\nUC )\u03c1in (UA\nUB\nUC )\u2020 .\n(4)\n\n2\n\n\fAfter that, Bob and Charlie return their qubits to Alice and so Alice gets \u03c1f . To determine the payoffs for\nthree players, we introduce the following payoff operator as a measurement operator;\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\n$(k) = $000 P000 + $001 P001 + $010 P010 + $100 P100 + $011 P011 + $110 P110 + $101 P101 + $111 P111 ,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere\nP000\n\n=\n\n|\u03c8000 >< \u03c8000 |,\n\nP111\n\n=\n\n|\u03c8111 >< \u03c8111 |,\n\nP001\n\n=\n\n|\u03c8001 >< \u03c8001 |,\n\nP110\n\n=\n\n|\u03c8110 >< \u03c8110 |,\n\nP010\n\n=\n\n|\u03c8010 >< \u03c8010 |,\n\nP101\n\n=\n\n|\u03c8101 >< \u03c8101 |,\n\nP011\n\n=\n\n|\u03c8011 >< \u03c8011 |,\n\nP100\n\n=\n\n|\u03c8100 >< \u03c8100 |,\n\n\u03b4\n\u03b4\n|\u03c8000 >= cos |000 > +i sin |111 >,\n2\n2\n\u03b4\n\u03b4\n|\u03c8111 >= cos |111 > +i sin |000 >,\n2\n2\n\u03b4\n\u03b4\n|\u03c8001 >= cos |001 > +i sin |110 >,\n2\n2\n\u03b4\n\u03b4\n|\u03c8110 >= cos |110 > +i sin |001 >,\n2\n2\n\u03b4\n\u03b4\n|\u03c8010 >= cos |010 > \u2212i sin |101 >,\n2\n2\n\u03b4\n\u03b4\n|\u03c8101 >= cos |101 > \u2212i sin |010 >,\n2\n2\n\u03b4\n\u03b4\n|\u03c8011 >= cos |011 > \u2212i sin |100 >,\n2\n2\n\u03b4\n\u03b4\n|\u03c8100 >= cos |100 > \u2212i sin |011 >\n2\n2\n\n(6)\n\n(k)\n\nwith 0 \u2264 \u03b4 \u2264 \u03c0/2 and $abc are the elements of the payoff matrix given in table 1. \u03b4 denotes the degree of\nentanglement in the base for measurement (computational) base. In quantum version of usual game theories, a\npayoff is really given by an expectation value.

Basic idea is that three players can\nknow the full information of game, other players' payoffs and strategies applied, when Alice open some classical\ninformation to Bob and Charlie. However, she can not get any useful information from it, even if Eva eavesdrops\non the classical information.\n\n3.1\n\nBasic Protocol of QKD\n\nFirst of all, we plainly describe the basic protocol proposed in this paper and the further details will be\ngiven the subsequent subsection.\nNotice that all players see the expression Eq.(8) for the expected payoff because they can evaluate it from\nthe setting of the quantum game and it is assumed that Alice, Bob and Charlie see the classical payoff matrix\ndescribed in Table 1( or Alice can set up the values in Table 1 to her convenience ). The basic protocol is given\nby the following 7 steps.\n1. Alice prepares an initial quantum state represented by Eq.(1).\n2. Alice sends the second qubit and the third qubit to Bob and Charlie, respectively, but keeps the first qubit\nfor herself.\n3. After Bob and Charlie accept their qubits, they and Alice locally manipulate their individual qubits by\nthe unitary operator Eq.(2) and Eq.(3), respectively. Three players can choose a favorite parameter set\n(strategy) of the unitary operators.\n4. After that, Bob and Charlie return their qubits manipulated by their unitary operator to Alice.\n5. Alice performs von Neumann measurement of the payoffs based on the measurement basis Eq.(6) and find\nthe strategies applied by Bob and Charlie from the results \u2217 .\n\u2217 It is a hard physical problem that what kind of physical experiment should be concretely conducted in order to determine a\ncomputational state shrunken at present. It is known that it is difficult that we even discriminate a special one from four 2qubit\nBell states used well in quantum information science[18].Thus it is beyond the limitation of this paper that author presents the\nconcrete experiment that identifies GHZ with 3qubit.\n\n4\n\n\f6. Alice conveys some information relative to the game to Bob and Charlie.\n7. By the information, Bob and Charlie can find all information, including opponents' strategy and payoffs,\nof the game.\nWhat information Alice should send is determined on a case-by-case as will be described later on in the\nconcrete. By the information, Bob and Charlie can find all information, including opponents' strategy and\npayoffs, of the game. Anyway, everyone has common information. If they come to an agreement about the\ncorrespondence between parameters applied in this protocol and some digital information each other in advance,\nthey can have some common digital information. This is the essential scenario for the key sharing conveyed by\nthe common information. The outline of this protocol is given in Fig.1.\nWe show that the scenario is actually available in the following subsections. What information should\nAlice open to the public in the scenario? How can Bob and Charlie find others' information about the game?\nWe will show them by giving concrete expressions for them. We investigate things dividing into three cases;\nnon-entangled cases, maximally entangled cases and partially entangled cases. Explicit expressions of various\nquantities are, however, too complicate to analysis them. So we impose some symmetries or conditions on each\ncase in order to simplify things.\n\nprepares an initial state\n\napply a unitary\noperation U A\n\nAlice\n\nsend\nqubit INFORM third\nqubit\n\nReturn\nqubit\n\nBob\n\nCharlie\n\napply a unitary\noperation\nUB\n\napply a unitary\noperation\nUC\n\nFig.1 The outline of the protocol@\n@\n\n3.2\n\nNon Entanglement Cases\n\nIn this subsection we consider the case without any entangled states, both the initial state and the computational base. We take \u03b3 = \u03b4 = 0 which leads to \u03b71 = 1 and \u03b72 = \u03be = 0, and assume that the phase parameters\n\u03b1i = \u03b2i = 0.\nThen we get the following formula for the expectation value of the payoff;\nP k (\u03b8k , 0, 0, 0, 0) =\n\n(k)\n\n=\n=\n=\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\nCA CB CC $000 + SA SB SC $111 + CA CB SC $001 + SA SB CC $110\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\n+SA CB CC $100 + CA SB SC $011 + SA CB SC $101 + CA SB CC $010\n\n(14)\n\n(k)\nCB CC DA\n(k)\nCA CC DB\n(k)\nCA CB DC\n\nfor Alice\n\n(15)\n\nfor Bob\n\n(16)\n\nfor Charlie,\n\n(17)\n\n(k)\n(k)\n(k)\n+ SB CC EA + CB SC FA + SB SC GA\n(k)\n(k)\n(k)\n+ SA CC EB + CA SC FB + SA SC GB\n(k)\n(k)\n(k)\n+ SA CB EC + CA SB FC + SA SB GC\n\nwhere\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\nEB\n\n(k)\nCB $100\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\nEA = CA $010 + SA $110\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\nGA = CA $011 + SA $111\n\n(k)\nDB\n\n(k)\nCB $000\n\n(k)\nSB $010\n\nDA = CA $000 + SA $100\nFA = CA $001 + SA $101\n=\n\n+\n\n5\n\n=\n\n+\n\n(k)\nSB $110\n\n(18)\n\n\f(k)\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\nDC\n(k)\nFC\n\n(k)\nCC $000\n(k)\nCC $010\n\n(k)\nSC $001\n(k)\nSC $011\n\nFB = CB $001 + SB $011\n=\n=\n\n+\n+\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\nEC\n(k)\nGC\n\n(k)\nCC $100\n(k)\nCC $110\n\n(k)\n\nGB = CB $101 + SB $111\n=\n=\n\n+\n+\n\n(19)\n\n(k)\nSC $101\n(k)\nSC $111 .\n\n(20)\n(k)\n\nEq.(14)-(17) are the same equations, but they are available expressions for each player, respectively. Xk\u2032 ,\nwhere X = D, E, F, G and k \u2032 = A,B and C, have proper information of player k \u2032 .\nIn this stage, we can describe the details of the step 5 in the previous subsection.\n5-1 Alice performs a von Neumann measurement of the payoffs for three players by using the measurement\nbasis Eq.(6), which is a sort of the physical observable. Then the final state shrinks to one of measurement\nbases with the possibility following quantum theory. For example, if the state shrinks to \u03c8000 , Alice finds\n(A)\nmeasurement payoffs PA = CA CB CC $000 as Alice's payoff. The measured payoff is represented as PA with\nsubscript A to mark off from the expected payoff P A .\n5-2 Alice measure Bob's payoff and Charlie's one in the same manner. They can be simultaneously measured,\nbecause their operators are commutable each other. Then Alice estimates the ratio PA : PB : PC . This\nvalue teaches Alice the shrunken state (\u03c8000 in the present example). Notice this is possible only when\n(k)\nAlice or a planner of the initial payoff matrix needs to alter the ration of $abc at every set of {abc}. Thus\n(A)\n(B)\n(C)\nAlice can see to which state the final state shrinks from the ratio, if the ratio of the payoffs $abc : $abc : $abc\nis different each other for distinct a, b, c.\n5-3 Alice can find strategies adopted by Bob and Charlie (of course her strategy CA ), as Alice knows to\nwhich state the measured state shrunk. For the example of 5.1, Alice see CB CC \u2020 . By using these values,\nAlice calculate the expected payoffs for three players and informs some information relative to game. As\nmentioned later, there is a case that all goes well only by getting the product value CB CC .\nIt is assumed that all players see the classical payoff values described in Table 1 or Alice informs the classical\npayoff values set up in Table I by her to Bob and Charlie. What even more information should Alice convey\nfor Bob and Charlie to get information about opponents' payoffs and strategies? Notice that three players see\nthe expression Eq. (8) of the expected payoffs. For Bob, unknown data are P A , P B , P C , CA and CC which\nare strategies of Alice and Charlie (notice that \u03b1k = \u03b2k = 0 and of course Bob knows his strategy CB ). Taking\naccount of k = A, B, C, Bob has three payoff equations given by Eq.(16) for k = A, B, C. So Alice needs to\nopen two data among them to the public. Thus Bob can evaluate other unknown data in principle. It, however,\nis too intricate to get explicit expressions. Imposing some conditions or symmetries will make the expressions\nsimpler but non-trivial.\nDue to the aim, Eq. (15)-(17) is rewritten as followings;\nP k (\u03b8k , 0, 0, 0, 0) =\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\n+CC (EA \u2212 GA ) + GA\n=\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\nfor Alice\n\n(k)\n\n(21)\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\nCA CC (DB \u2212 EB \u2212 FB + GB ) + CA (FB \u2212 GB )\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\n+CC (EB \u2212 GB ) + GB\n=\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\nCB CC (DA \u2212 EA \u2212 FA + GA ) + CB (FA \u2212 GA )\n\n(k)\n(k)\n(k)\nCA CB (DC \u2212 EC \u2212 FC\n(k)\n(k)\n(k)\n+CB (EC \u2212 GC ) + GC\n\nfor Bob\n+\n\n(k)\nGC )\n\n(22)\n+\n\n(k)\nCA (FC\n\n\u2212\n\n(k)\nGC )\n\nfor Charlie\n\n(23)\n\nIt is natural to classify into the following three cases to simplify the things from Eq.(21)-(23);\n\nCase I:\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\n(FA \u2212 GA =)FB \u2212 GB = FC \u2212 GC = 0\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\n$001 = $101 , $011 = $111 and $010 = $110 ,\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\nEC\n\n(k)\nGC\n\n($001 = $101 = $011 = $111 and $010 = $110 ),\nCase II:\n\n(k)\n(EA\n\n\u2212\n\n(k)\nGA\n\n(k)\n=)EB\n\n\u2212\n\n(k)\nGB\n\n=\n\n\u2212\n\n(24)\n\n=0\n\n\u2020 If Alice wants to know \u03b8\nB and \u03b8C , independently, all players have only to play once again with the same strategies as ones\nin the first round.

Thus Alice has fully information about\nthis quantum game in the end. In above three cases, we can not take k = A, B, C but should take two among\n(A)\n(B)\n(C)\nA, B, C as k, because we need to satisfy the condition that the ratio of the payoffs $abc : $abc : $abc is different\neach other for distinct a, b, c when k = A, B, C. as mentioned in the step 5.2.\n(k)\n(k)\nIn the case I without FA \u2212 GA = 0, we obtain\nCA\n\n=\n\nCC\n\n=\n\nCA\n\n=\n\nCB\n\n=\n\n(B)\n\n(A)\n\n(A)\n\n(A)\n\n(B)\n\n(B)\n\n(A)\n\n(B)\n\n(B)\n\n(B)\n\n(A)\n\n(A)\n\n(P B \u2212 GB )(EB \u2212 GB ) \u2212 (P A \u2212 GB )(EB \u2212 GB )\n\n(P A \u2212 GB )(DB \u2212 EB ) \u2212 (P B \u2212 GB )(DB \u2212 EB )\n\n,\n\n(A)\n\n(A)\n\nP A \u2212 GB\n(A)\n\n(A)\n\n(A)\n\nCA (DB \u2212 EB ) + EB \u2212 GB\n\n,\n\n(B)\n\n(A)\n\n(A)\n\n(A)\n\n(B)\n\n(A)\n\n(B)\n\n(B)\n\n(B)\n\n(A)\n\n(P B \u2212 GC )(EC \u2212 GC ) \u2212 (P A \u2212 GC )(EC\n\nfor Bob\n\n(27)\n\nfor Charlie.\n\n(28)\n\n(B)\n\n\u2212 GC )\n(A)\n\n(P A \u2212 GC )(DC \u2212 EC ) \u2212 (P B \u2212 GC )(DC \u2212 EC )\n\n,\n\n(A)\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\n(A)\n\nP A \u2212 GC\n(A)\n\n(A)\n\n(A)\n\nCA (DC \u2212 EC ) + EC \u2212 GC\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\n,\n\n(k)\n\nNotice that EA = $111 , FA = GA = $001 in this case.

Xk\u0304\u2032\nwhere k \u0304\u2032 = B, C, however, is nontrivial and depends on both payoff matrix and their respective strategy. Thus\nthis condition does not make above expressions trivial.\nWhen k takes A and B in the Case I, from Eq.(27) and (28), we see that when Alice opens P A and P B to\nthe public, Bob and Charlie can find CA . As result, they can get the information about opponent's strategy, CC\nfor Bob and CB for Charlie. So Bob and Charlie can find the strategies of all players and evaluate P k . Three\nplayers come to acquire full information of the quantum game, P k and Ck , since Alice originally observes all\nstates and payoffs.\nWhen Alice informs Bob of P A and his expected payoff P B , and Charlie of P A and his expected payoff P C ,\nthey can also get full information according to the equations derived from Eq.(22) and (23) for Charlie.

Three players come to acquire full information of the\nquantum game, P k and Ck .\nIt is also impossible that Alice informs Bob of P A and his payoff P B , and Charlie of P A and his payoff P C ,\nbecause of the same reason as in the Case I,\nThere is another case to be considered. Alice opens all of her information, PA and CA . Then Bob and\nCharlie can easily evaluate the strategy of their opponent from the following Eq.(31) and (32).\n(A)\n\n(A)\n\nCC\n\n=\n\nP A \u2212 GB \u2212 CA (FC\n\nCB\n\n=\n\nP A \u2212 GC \u2212 CA (FC\n\n(A)\n\n(A)\n\n\u2212 GC )\n\n(A)\n\n(CA (DB \u2212 FB )\n(A)\n\n(A)\n\nfor Bob\n\n(31)\n\n,\n\nfor Charlie.\n\n(32)\n\n(A)\n\n\u2212 GC )\n\n(A)\n\n(A)\n\n,\n\nCA (DC \u2212 FC )\n\nThey can also know full information of this game by similar logic to the former case.\nEverything becomes simpler in the case III. From Eq. (21)-(23), we obtain\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\nPk\n\n= CA CC (DB \u2212 FB ) + GB ,\n\nCC\n\n=\n\nPk\n\n= CB CC (DC \u2212 FC ) + GC ,\n\nCB\n\n=\n\n(A)\n\nP A \u2212 GB\n(A)\n\n(A)\n\nCA (DB \u2212 FB )\n(k)\n\n,\n\n(k)\n\nfor Bob.\n\n(33)\n\nfor Charlie.\n\n(34)\n\n(k)\n\n(A)\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\nP A \u2212 GC\n(A)\n\n(A)\n\nCA (DC \u2212 FC )\n\n,\n\n(35)\n\n(k)\n\nThen Ek\u2032 = Gk\u2032 = Fk\u2032 = $100 . When Alice opens P A and C A to the public, all players know full information\nof this game for the same logic as before.\n(k)\n(k)\n(k)\n(k)\nand Ek\u0304\u2032 = Gk\u2032\nIf the further condition Dk\u0304\u2032 = Fk\u2032\n \u0304 adding to Case III is imposed, we have only a trivial\n \u0304\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\nresult. Then we notice that $000 = $001 and $010 = $110 , $100 = $101 and $111 = $110 from DB = FB\n(k)\n(k)\n(k)\n(k)\n(k)\n(k)\n(k)\n(k)\n(k)\n(k)\nand EB = GB . Moreover we notice that $000 = $011 and $011 = $001 , $111 = $101 and $100 = $110 from\n(k)\n(k)\n(k)\n(k)\n(k)\n(k)\n(k)\n(k)\n(k)\nDC = FC and EC = GC . So $0ab take all the same value and $1ab take so. After all, Dk\u0304\u2032 = Fk\u2032\n \u0304 = $000 ,\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\nEC = GC = $100 and EB = GB = $110 . Thus all Xk\u2032 s' are trivial and have no private information for Bob\nand Charlie.\n\n3.3\n\nMaximally Entanglement Cases\n\nWe consider the maximally entangled cases in the initial state and the computational base where \u03b3 = \u03b4 =\n\u03c0/2. Then we see that \u03be = \u03b71 = \u03b72 = 1/2 and the last term in Eq.(8) that the coefficient of the term is\n1\n8 sin[\u03b8A , \u03b8B , \u03b8C ] vanishes. When \u03b8B = \u03b8C = 0, we obtain the trivial expected payoff;\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\nP k = CA $000 \u00b1 SA $001 .\n\n(36)\n\nSo all people including eavesdropper Eva can obtain full information of this game as soon as Alice opens\nsomething of (classical) information of this game to the public. If Alice privately conveys it to Bob and Charlie,\nEva can obtain full information by eavesdrops. Since the information is a classical type (note the information\nsuch as P k and Ck is classical), it is difficult to detect the eavesdrops.\nWe take \u03b2k = \u03b1k = 0 for simplicity but \u03b8A \u03b8B \u03b8C 6= 0. Then we obtain the following equations for the\nexpectation value of the expected payoff;\nP k (\u03b8k , 0, 0, \u03c0/2, \u03c0/2) =\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\nCA CB CC $000 + SA SB SC $111 + CA CB SC $001 + SA SB CC $110\n8\n\n\f(k)\n\n=\n=\n=\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\n+SA CB CC $011 + CA SB SC $100 + SA CB SC $010 + CA SB CC $101 ,\n\n(37)\n\n\u2032(k)\nCB CC DA\n\u2032(k)\nCA CC DB\n\u2032(k)\nCA CB DC\n\nfor Alice,\n\n(38)\n\nfor Bob,\n\n(39)\n\nfor Charlie,\n\n(40)\n\n\u2032(k)\n\u2032(k)\n\u2032(k)\n+ SB SC EA + CB SC FA + SB CC GA ,\n\u2032(k)\n\u2032(k)\n\u2032(k)\n+ SA SC EB + CA SC FB + SA CC GB ,\n\u2032(k)\n\u2032(k)\n\u2032(k)\n+ SA SB EC + CA SB FC + SA CB GC ,\n\nwhere\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\nEA = CA $101 + SA $110 ,\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\nGA = CA $100 + SA $111 ,\n\n(k)\nDB\n(k)\nFB\n(k)\nDC\n(k)\nFC\n\n(k)\nCB $000\n(k)\nCB $001\n(k)\nCC $000\n(k)\nCC $101\n\nDA = CA $000 + SA $011 ,\nFA = CA $001 + SA $110 ,\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\n(k)\n+ SB $101 ,\n(k)\n+ SB $011 ,\n(k)\n+ SC $001 ,\n(k)\n+ SC $100 ,\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\nEB\n(k)\nGB\n(k)\nEC\n(k)\nGC\n\n(k)\nCB $011\n(k)\nCB $010\n(k)\nCC $011\n(k)\nCC $110\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\n(k)\n+ SB $111 ,\n(k)\n+ SB $111 ,\n(k)\n+ SC $010 ,\n(k)\n+ SC $111 .\n\n(41)\n(42)\n(43)\n\nBy comparing these equations to (14)-(20) in the non-entangled case, we find that both expressions are\ntransferred from one hand to the other by exchanging 100 \u2194 011 and 010 \u2194 101. So there is a sort of symmetry\nin the both cases;\n100 \u2190\u2192 011 and 010 \u2190\u2192 101.\n\n(44)\n\nThus there is no essential difference between maximally entangled case and non-entangled case.\nWe give a little comment on the cases of \u03b1k 6= 0 6= \u03b2k . In both non-entangled case and maximally entanglement case, the last term in Eq.(8) vanishes.

There are many\nequivalent choices of these parameters and the this choice is only one example among them. The following\ndiscussions show that QKD is feasible even in this special case including further condition added later.\nThen we obtain the following equations for the last term in Eq.(8);\nP k (\u03b8k , 0, \u03b2k , \u03b4, \u03b3)last\n\n=\n\nn\n\u0001\n1\nsin[\u03b8A , \u03b8B , \u03b8C ] sin \u03b4 \u2212 \u03b3\n8\n\nX\n\na,b,c\u2208{0,1}\n\no\n(k)\n$abc (\u22121)(a+b+c) .\n\n(46)\n\nSo we consider the case of \u03b4 = 0 and \u03b3 = \u03c0/2, or \u03b4 = \u03c0/2 and \u03b3 = 0 as a partially entangled case.

That such economical point can be realize is a notable feature in the partially entangled case.\nCase (III); we only obtain a trivial result;\nP k = Gkk\u2032 = 1.\n\n3.5\n\n(72)\n\nMore Protocol\n\nWe make the QKD protocol described in the subsection 3.1 more definite so as to be consummate one.\nThe procedure given in the subsection 3.1 has to be repeated many times to distribute a key with a large bit\nto all players. First of all, it is imperative that three players ahead recognize the correspondence between the\ninformation of the game and some natural numbers;\n(r)\n\nCk\nP\n\nk(r)\n\n(r)\n\n\u21d0\u21d2 mk\n\nfor 2r-th round,\n\n\u21d0\u21d2\n\nfor 2r-th round, ,\n\n(r)\nnk\n\n11\n\n(73)\n\n\f(r)\n\n(r)\n\nwhere k is A or B or C, and mk and nk are some natural numbers, respectively. Thus every player obtains\na common number\n(1) (1) (1) (1) (2) (2) (2) (2)\n(r) (r) (r) (r)\nmB mC n B n C mB mC n B n C * * * mB mC n B n C\n(74)\nas a key information by repeating the procedure given in the subsection 3.1 2r times. We can obtain a key\nnumber with double the length of the round number.\n\n4\n4.1\n\nBrief Comment of Robustness for Eavesdrop\nPhase Damping Model for Eavesdropper\n\nThere may be an eavesdropper, Eva, in a quantum line from Alice to Bob or Charlie. She may perform a\nmeasurement on the qubit that Alice (Bob or Charlie) transmits to Bob or Charlie (Alice). We follow Ramzan\nand Khan [10] in the discussion as to security against bugging.\nAn action of measurement performed by Eva on the qubit can be modeled as the action of phase damping\nchannel [1]. After measurement by Eva, the quantum state with 1 qubit that Alice transmitted to Bob and\nCharlie is transformed into\n2\nX\nAi \u03c1in A\u2020i ,\n(75)\n\u03c11 =\ni=0\n\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\nwhere A0 = p|0 >< 0|, A1 = p|1 >< 1| and A2 = 1 \u2212 pI\u02c6 with the identity operator I\u02c6 are the Kraus\noperators[1]. These operators are the same as ones in the phase flip channel whose channel flips the state of a\nqubit from |0 > to |1 > with probability p[1].\nThis can be extended to\n\u03c1N =\n\n2\nX\ni=0\n\nAi1 \u2297 Ai2 * * * \u2297 AiN \u2297 \u03c1in A\u2020iN \u2297 * * * A\u2020i2 \u2297 A\u2020i1\n\n(76)\n\nfor N qubits, where the Kraus operator is described as Ais for each qubit s, when each qubit is measured. Then\nthe payoff is given by the following replacement in Eq.(8);\n\u03be\n(a+b+c)\n\n(\u22121)\n\n=\u21d2 \u03be\u03bcp ,\n=\u21d2 \u03bcp (\u22121)(a+b+c) ,\n\n(77)\n\nwhere \u03bcp = 1 \u2212 p.\n\n4.2\n\nNon-Entangled and Maximally Entangled Cases\n\nIn this subsection we focus our attention to the non-entangled case (\u03b3 = \u03b4 = \u03be = 0) and maximally entangled\ncase (\u03b3 = \u03b4 = \u03c0/2 and \u03be = 1/2).

So we can not detect the influence of wiretapping. But P k depends on \u03bcp in the maximally entangled case. Thus we can detect a wiretapper by comparing\ntwo payoffs (one has original value and another has a deviate value from it). Notice that when \u03b1k \u03b2k 6= 0, tuning\nthe values of \u03b1k and \u03b2k obscures \u03bcp dependence on the payoff. As result, detecting wiretappers is available only\nat \u03b1k = \u03b2k = 0.\nThough the maximally entangled case and the non-entangled case provided essentially an equivalent way as\nQKD in the previous section, the latter is not available in the case with wiretappers.\n\n4.3\n\nPartially Entangled Cases\n\nIn this cases, (i) \u03b4 = 0 and \u03b3 = \u03c0/2 or (ii) \u03b4 = \u03c0/2 and \u03b3 = 0. Moreover \u03b8A \u03b8B \u03b8C 6= 0, \u03b1k = 0 = \u03b2C ,\n\u03b2A \u2212 \u03b2B = \u03c0 and \u03b2A + \u03b2B = 2\u03c0 are chosen for simplicity like in the subsection 3.4.\nThen we obtain the following expressions for the last term in Eq. (8);\nP k (\u03b8k , 0, \u03b2k , \u03b3, \u03b4)last\n\no\nn\n\u0001 X\n1\n(k)\n$abc (\u22121)(a+b+c) , for (\u03b4, \u03b3) = (0, \u03c0/2),\n\u03bcp sin[\u03b8A , \u03b8B , \u03b8C ] sin \u03b4 \u2212 \u03b3\n8\na,b,c\u2208{0,1}\no\nn\n\u0001 X\n1\n(k)\n$abc (\u22121)(a+b+c) , for (\u03b4, \u03b3) = (\u03c0/2, 0).(81)\n= \u2212 sin[\u03b8A , \u03b8B , \u03b8C ] sin \u03b4 \u2212 \u03b3\n8\n=\n\na,b,c\u2208{0,1}\n\nSo the payoff is obtained by\nP k (\u03b8k , 0, \u03b2k , \u03b3, \u03b4) =\n\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n1h\n(k)\n(k)\n(k)\n(k)\n(k)\n(k)\nCA CB CC $000 + $111 + SA SB SC $000 + $111 + CA CB SC $001 + $110\n2\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\n(k)\n\n+ SA SB CC $001 + $110 + SA CB CC $100 + $011 + CA SB SC $100 + $011\n\u0011i\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n(k)\n(k)\n(k)\n(k)\n+ SA CB SC $101 + $010 + CA SB CC $101 + $010 + Eq.(81).\n\n(82)\n\nThus the payoff depends on \u03bcp = 1 \u2212 p only in the case (i) from Eq. (81) and (82). In principle, we can detect\nan eavesdropper, only when the parameters are (i) \u03b4 = 0 and \u03b3 = \u03c0/2. From 4.2 and 4.3, we find that when\n\u03b3 = \u03c0/2 where the initial state is an entangled state, we can detect an eavesdropper.\n\n5\n\nSummary and Consideration\n\nIn this paper we proposed a new QKD method. This method is different from the scheme proposed by [10],\nthough it essentially takes our ground on three-player quantum games and GHZ state as an entangled state [16]\nis used.\nAlice , Bob and Charlie join the game. Alice prepares the initial quantum state, and sends the second qubit\nand third qubit to Bob and Charlie, respectively, but keeps the first qubit for herself. After Bob and Charlie\naccept their qubits, they locally manipulate their individual qubits by some unitary operator, respectively.\nThree players can choose a favorite parameter set of the unitary operators. After that, Bob and Charlie return\ntheir qubit manipulated by their unitary operators to Alice. Alice performs a measure of the total state (3\nqubits)to determine the payoffs, and conveys some information drived from von Neumann measurement to Bob\nand Charlie or opens to the public. By the information, Bob and Charlie can find opponent's strategy and\npayoff of the game. Thus everyone has common information. There are not any arbiters in our scheme, since\nexistence of an arbiter increases the risk of wiretapping. For it is difficult to detect wiretapping, when an arbiter\nsends classical information.\n\n13\n\n\fWe investigated by dividing our protocol into three cases, non-entangled cases, maximally entangled cases\nand partially entangled cases, to analyze it. We found that non-entangled cases and maximally entangled ones\nare essentially equivalent, since they are converted by a linear transformation each other. On the contrary, the\npartially entangled case has a little particular property and produces a sort of dense coding method.\nLastly we discussed robustness for eavesdrop so that we showed that though maximally entangled case and\nnon-entangled case provided essentially equivalent way as QKD, the latter is not available in the case there are\neavesdroppers. The effect of eavesdropping disappears from the payoff in the non-entangled case. In partially\nentangled case, we find that we can detect an eavesdropper by choosing some suitable parameter for \u03b4 and \u03b3,\nespecially \u03b3 = \u03c0/2, in principle. So this case gives a robust protocol. As summary, we showed an entangled\ninitial state (\u03b3 6= 0) gives robust protocols in the all cases of this paper.\n\nReferences\n[1] M.A. Nielsen and I.L.Chuang, \"Quantum Computational and Quantum Information, Cambridge University\nPress, 2000\n[2] D.A.
