As a matter of fact, it has been an old dream to reduce the fundamental\nlaws of physics to geometry since Einstein's formulation of general relativity. In particular, it is a remarkable achievement that all the building blocks of quantum field theory can be formulated in terms of geometric concepts such as\nvector bundles, connections, curvatures, covariant derivatives and spinors [1]. More recently, Marmo and coworkers\nhave pointed out the potential usefulness of a geometrical formulation of quantum theory to investigate the entanglement and separability for quantum states describing composite systems [2].\nIn 1985, Campbell showed that geometry can be introduced into probability calculus as follows [3]: for a fixed\nprobability distribution, define the inner product of two random variables to be the expectation of the product of\nthese variables. Differential geometry emerges when we consider varying the probability distribution, either directly\nor through changing parameters on which the distribution depends. Within such a geometric framework, the sets\nof probability distributions are viewed as differentiable manifolds, the random variables appear as vectors and the\nexpectation values of random variables are replaced with inner products in tangent spaces to such manifolds of\nprobabilities. In 1995, Braunstein and Caves extended Campbell's ideas to the quantum framework [4].\nHere, inspired by Marmo and following the lead of Braunstein and Caves, we explore the possibility of the conceptual\nusefulness of differential geometric tools in quantifying the effect of depolarizing channels on quantum states by\ncomparing the geometries of the interior of the undeformed and deformed Bloch spheres related to density operators\non a two-dimensional Hilbert space.\nII.\n\nDIFFERENTIAL GEOMETRY OF DENSITY OPERATORS\n\nFor a more detailed presentation of this preliminary material, we refer to [4, 5]. Consider the quantum analogue\nM~\u03c1 of the probability simplex, the space of density operators ~\u03c1 written as vectors in L (H), the linear space of all\nlinear operators on a n-dimensional Hilbert space H,\n\uf8fc\n\uf8f1\nn\n\uf8fd\n\uf8f2\nX\ndef\ndef\n\u03c1ij ~eij , ~\u03c1 = ~\u03c1\u2020 , tr (~\u03c1) = 1, ~\u03c1 \u2265 0 .\n(1)\nM~\u03c1 = ~\u03c1 \u2208 L (H) : ~\u03c1 =\n\uf8fe\n\uf8f3\ni, j=1\n\n\u0001\nThe space M~\u03c1 is an n2 \u2212 1 -dimensional real manifold with complicated boundary.

In terms of the Kraus operator-sum decomposition\nof the depolarizing channel, it turns out that an arbitrary initial density operator \u03c1 of the qubit is mapped into,\n\u03c1 \u2192 \u03c1\u2032 = (1 \u2212 p) \u03c1 +\n\np\n(\u03c3 1 \u03c1\u03c3 1 + \u03c3 2 \u03c1\u03c3 2 + \u03c3 3 \u03c1\u03c3 3 ) .\n3\n\n(12)\n\nAn alternative manner to characterize the action of a depolarizing channel on quantum states can be described by\nassuming that the initial state is one of the following four mutually orthogonal maximally entangled two-qubits states,\ndef 1\n\u03c8 \u00b1 = \u221a [|01iAB \u00b1 |10iAB ] and, \u03c6\u00b1\n2\n\nFor instance, take into consideration \u03c6+\ndef\n\n\u03c1\u03c6 + = \u03c6\n\nAB\n\n+\n\n(13)\n\nand consider the action of the depolarizing channel on the first qubit,\n\n+\n\n\u03c6\n\n1\n= \u221a [|00iAB \u00b1 |11iAB ] .\n2\n\ndef\nAB\n\n\u2192\n\n\u03c1\u2032\u03c6+\n\n4\n= p\n3\n\n\u0012\n\n1 AB\nI\n4\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\n4\n+ 1 \u2212 p \u03c1\u03c6 + .\n3\n\n(14)\n\nObserve that I AB is the identity operator on the Hilbert space HA \u2297HB and equals IAB = \u03c1\u03c6+ +\u03c1\u03c6\u2212 +\u03c1\u03c8+ +\u03c1\u03c8\u2212 ,with\ndef\n\ndef\n\n\u03c1\u03c8\u00b1 = \u03c8 \u00b1 \u03c8 \u00b1 , \u03c1\u03c6\u00b1 = \u03c6\u00b1 \u03c6\u00b1 . From (14), it follows that a depolarizing error occurs with probability 34 p and\nthe error completely randomizes the state \u03c6+ AB provided that p \u2264 34 . The transformed density matrix \u03c1\u2032\u03c6+ becomes\nmaximally random (\u03c1\u2032\u03c6+ = 14 IAB ) in the limiting case of p = 43 .\nAn additional manner to characterize depolarizing errors on density operators is that of considering its action on\nthe Bloch sphere representation of an arbitrary initial density operator \u03c1 of the qubit,\n\u03c1=\n\n1\n(I + P * \u03c3) ,\n2\n\n(15)\n\ndef\n\nwhere P = Tr(\u03c3\u03c1) is the Bloch polarization vector. For kPk = 1 the density matrices describe a pure state whereas\nfor kPk < 1 one has a mixed state. Thus, the density matrix \u03c1 is uniquely determined by a point of the unit sphere\n0 \u2264 kPk \u2264 1 (unit 3-ball). For depolarizing errors, the Bloch sphere contracts uniformly under\nthe action of the\n\u0001\ndepolarizing channel since the spin polarization of the qubit P is reduced by a factor 1 \u2212 34 p where p denotes the\nerror probability,\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n1\n4\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u03c1 = (I + P * \u03c3) \u2192 \u03c1 = (I + P *\u03c3) with P = 1 \u2212 p P.\n(16)\n2\n2\n3\nIn summary, the two main features that characterize the action of the depolarizing channel on density operators is\nthe randomization of maximally entangled quantum states (Eq. (14)) and the uniform contraction of the deformed\nBloch sphere (Eq. (16)). In which manner do these features emerge in a Riemannian geometric characterization of\ndepolarizing channels? We attempt to provide an answer to this question in the next Section.\nIV.\n\nDEPOLARIZED DENSITY OPERATORS: THE GEOMETRIC APPROACH\n\nReturning to the formalism introduced in Section II, it follows that an arbitrary density operator~\u03c1 reads,\n~\u03c1 =\n\ni 1h\ni\n1 h~\nI + P*~\n\u03c3 =\nI~ + kPk n*~\n\u03c3 ,\n2\n2\n\n(17)\n\nwhere the Bloch vector P and the Pauli (operator) vector ~\n\u03c3 are,\ndef\n\nP=\n\n3\nX\n\nk=1\n\ndef\n\nP k ek = kPk n and, ~\n\u03c3=\n\n3\nX\n\n~\u03c3 k ek ,\n\n(18)\n\nk=1\n\nrespectively and where ek are unit orthonormal vectors spanning R3 . Recall that the infinitesimal quantum line\nelement ds2 is given by,\nds2 = g~\u03c1 (d~\u03c1, d~\u03c1) = Tr [d~\u03c1L~\u03c1 (d~\u03c1)] ,\n\n(19)\n\n\f4\ndef\n\nwhere g~\u03c1 denotes the metric tensor at point ~\u03c1. Denoting kPk = m, from (17) d~\u03c1 reads,\nd~\u03c1 =\n\n1\n1\n1\nd (mn*~\n\u03c3 ) = (dmn* ~\n\u03c3 + mdn*~\n\u03c3 ) = (dmn + mdn) *~\n\u03c3,\n2\n2\n2\n\n(20)\n\nwhile L~\u03c1 (d~\u03c1) becomes,\nL~\u03c1 (d~\u03c1) = L~\u03c1\n\n\u0012\n\n1\n(dmn + mdn) *~\n\u03c3\n2\n\n\u0013\n\n=\n\ndm\nm\nL~\u03c1 (n*~\n\u03c3 ) + L~\u03c1 (dn*~\n\u03c3) .\n2\n2\n\n(21)\n\nAfter some algebra, it follows that\nL~\u03c1 (n*~\n\u03c3) =\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\n2 \u2212mI \u0303 + n*\u03c3\u0303\n1 \u2212 m2\n\nand, L~\u03c1 (dn*~\n\u03c3 ) = 2dn*\u03c3\u0303,\n\n(22)\n\ndef\n\nwith \u03c3\u0303 = (\u03c3\u0303 1 , \u03c3\u0303 2 , \u03c3\u0303 3 ). Using (20), (21) and (22) and noticing that\n\u0001\n\u0001\ndmn+m 1 \u2212 m2 dn = 1 \u2212 m2 d P + (P*dP ) P,\n\n(23)\n\nthe line element ds2 in (19) becomes\n\n2\n\nds2 = dP *d P +\n\n(P*dP )\n.\n1 \u2212 m2\n\n(24)\n\nWe now recall that if a distance between density matrices expresses statistical distinguishability then the distance\nmust decrease under randomization (coarse-graining) [8]. Therefore, we may wonder whether or not depolarizing\nerrors make quantum states less distinguishable by reducing their relative statistical distance. Indeed, from (16) and\n(24) it follows that\nds2 = dP *d P +\nwhere ds\u20322 reads,\nds\u20322 =\n\n\u00012\n1\n1\n2\n(P*dP ) \u2192 ds\u20322 = dP \u2032 *dP \u2032 +\nP\u2032 *dP \u2032 ,\n1 \u2212 m2\n1 \u2212 m\u20322\n\n\u00014\n\u00132\n\u0012\n1 \u2212 43 p\n4\ni (P*dP )2 .\n1 \u2212 p dP *dP + h\n\u00012\n4\n3\n2\n1 \u2212 1 \u2212 3p m\n\n(25)\n\n(26)\n\nComparing (25) and (26), we observe that\n\n\u00014\n\u00132\n\u0012\n1 \u2212 34 p\n4\n1\ni\u2264\n,\n1 \u2212 p \u2264 1 and, h\n\u00012\n4\n3\n1\n\u2212\nm2\n2\n1 \u2212 1 \u2212 3p m\n\nsince p \u2265 0 and 0 \u2264 m \u2264 1, respectively. Thus,\n\u0002 \u0003\n\u0003\n\u0003\ndef \u0002\ndef \u0002\nds2 = ds2 undeformed \u2192 ds\u20322 = ds2 depolarized \u2264 ds2 undeformed .\n\n(27)\n\n(28)\n\nDepolarizing errors randomize quantum states rendering them less distinguishable by decreasing their relative statistical distance. Furthermore, introducing a fourth coordinate P 0 ,\nq\np\ndef\n2\nP 0 = 1 \u2212 kPk = 1 \u2212 m2 ,\n(29)\n\nwe get,\n\ndP 0 =\n\n(P*dP )2\nm2 dm2\n=\n.\n1 \u2212 m2\n1 \u2212 m2\n\n(30)\n\nThus, the interior of the Bloch sphere is a 3-unit sphere S 3 , a three-dimensional sphere of unit radius in a fourdimensional Euclidean space,\n\u0001\ndef \b\n(31)\nS 3 = P \u03bc = P 0 , P 1 , P 2 , P 3 \u2208 R4 : P \u03bc P\u03bc = 1 ,\n\n\f5\nand the geometry on such surface is induced by the line four-dimensional flat Euclidean line element\nds2 = dP \u03bc dP\u03bc = dP 0\n\n\u00012\n\n+ dP 1\n\n\u00012\n\n+ dP 2\n\n\u00012\n\n+ dP 3\n\n\u00012\n\n.\n\n(32)\n\nThe geodesic paths for the line element ds2 parametrized in terms of the arc-length s are given by,\nP \u03bc = P \u03bc (s) = a\u03bc cos s + b\u03bc sin s,\n\n(33)\n\nwhere a\u03bc and b\u03bc are mutually orthogonal unit 4\u2212vectors,\na\u03bc a\u03bc = b\u03bd b\u03bd = 1 and, a\u03bc b\u03bc = b\u03bd a\u03bd = 0.\n\n(34)\n\nTrajectories in (33) are great circles, circles that have the same center and radius as the sphere. It is straightforward\n\u2032\n3\nto show that the geodesics P \u03bc on Sdeformed\nparametrized in terms of the arc-length s are given by,\ns\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u00132 h\n\u0013\ni\n4\n4\n2\nP \u20320 (s) = 1 \u2212 1 \u2212 p\n1 \u2212 (P 0 (s)) and P \u2032k (s) = 1 \u2212 p P k (s) ,\n(35)\n3\n3\n\u2032\n\nfor k = 1, 2, 3. Thus, the three \"spacial\" components of the four-vector P \u03bc are simply the uniformly contracted\n3\nversions of the geodesic paths on Sundeformed\nwhere 1 \u2212 43 p denotes the contraction factor.\nV.\n\nCOMPARISONS WITH OTHER QUANTUM DISTINGUISHABILITY METRICS\n\nFor the sake of completeness, we point out that in the classical information geometric setting there is essentially\none classical statistical distance quantifying the distinguishability between two probability distributions. Indeed, the\nclassical Fisher information metric [9] is the only (except for an overall multiplicative constant) monotone Riemannian\nmetric with the property of having its line element reduced under Markov morphisms (stochastic maps). In the\nquantum setting, Riemannian metrics are considered on the space of density matrices. The requirement that the\ndistance between density matrices expresses quantum statistical distinguishability implies that this distance must\ndecrease under coarse-graining (stochastic maps) [8]. Unlike the classical case, it turns out that there are infinitely\nmany Riemannian metrics satisfying this requirement [10]. In what follows, we clarify the connections between the\nquantum line element we used in Section IV and other common metrics of use in the quantum framework.\nA.\n\nThe Fubini-Study metric\n\nThe Fubini-Study infinitesimal line element ds2FS is given by [11],\n2\n\n2\n\n\u03c8 \u2032 |\u03c8\n\nds2FS = kd\u03c8k \u2212 |h\u03c8|d\u03c8i| = 1 \u2212\n\n2\n\n,\n\n(36)\n\nwhere |\u03c8i and \u03c8 \u2032 are neighboring normalized pure states expanded in an orthonormal basis {|ki} with k \u2208 {1,..., N },\n|\u03c8i =\n\nN\nX\n\u221a\nk=1\n\npk ei\u03c6k |ki and, \u03c8 \u2032 =\n\nN p\nX\npk + dpk ei(\u03c6k +d\u03c6k ) |ki ,\n\n(37)\n\nk=1\n\nrespectively. Observe that up to the second order Taylor expansion, \u03c8 \u2032 reads\n\u03c8\u2032 =\n\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0013\nN \u0014\nX\n1 dpk\n1 2\n1 dp2k\n\u221a\ni\u03c6k\npk 1 +\n1\n+\nid\u03c6\n\u2212\n|ki .\ne\n\u2212\nd\u03c6\nk\n2 pk\n8 p2k\n2 k\n\n(38)\n\nk=1\n\nUpon use of the normalization constraint and its differential form,\n\u03c8 \u2032 |\u03c8 becomes\n\u03c8 \u2032 |\u03c8 = 1 \u2212\n\nPN\n\nk=1\n\npk = 1 and\n\nN\n\nN\n\nN\n\nN\n\nk=1\n\nk=1\n\nk=1\n\nk=1\n\nPN\n\nk=1\n\nX\niX\n1 X dp2k\n1X\n\u2212i\npk d\u03c6k \u2212\ndpk d\u03c6k \u2212\npk d\u03c62k .\n8\npk\n2\n2\n\ndpk = 0 respectively,\n\n(39)\n\n\f6\nIt is straightforward to compute\n\n\u03c8 \u2032 |\u03c8\nds2FS\n\n2\n\nand to arrive at the Fubini-Study infinitesimal line element\nN\n\nN\n\nk=1\n\nk=1\n\n1 X dp2k X\npk d\u03c62k \u2212\n+\n=\n4\npk\n\nN\nX\n\npk d\u03c6k\n\nk=1\n\n!2\n\n.\n\n(40)\n\ndef\n\nIt is also ds2FS = hd\u03c8 \u22a5 |d\u03c8 \u22a5 i, where |d\u03c8 \u22a5 i = |d\u03c8i \u2212 h\u03c8|d\u03c8i |\u03c8i is the projection of |d\u03c8i orthogonal to |\u03c8i with\ndef\n\n|d\u03c8i = \u03c8 \u2032 \u2212 |\u03c8i. Then, for pure states \u03c1 = |\u03c8i h\u03c8| and d\u03c1 = |\u03c8i hd\u03c8 \u22a5 | + |d\u03c8 \u22a5 i h\u03c8|, Eq.(11) reduces to\n\u0001\nds2 = 2tr d\u03c12 = 4 hd\u03c8 \u22a5 |d\u03c8 \u22a5 i ,\n\n(41)\n\nwhich is, except for an overall real constant, the Fubini-Study metric (40).\nIn conclusion, due to the fact that the Fubini-Study metric quantifies distinguishability of pure states only, it is not\na useful metric for a geometric characterization of depolarizing channels.\nB.\n\nThe Bures metric\n\nFor a detailed presentation concerning the computation of the Bures metric for two-dimensional density matrices,\nwe refer to [12]. Consider two density matrices \u03c11 and \u03c12 ,\n\u03c11 =\n\n1\n1\nI + x1 *\u03c3 and, \u03c12 = I + x2 *\u03c3,\n2\n2\n\n(42)\n\nwith xi in R3 and \u03c3 = (\u03c3 x , \u03c3 y , \u03c3 z ). By definition, \u03c11 and \u03c12 must have positive eigenvalues and this implies that\nthe magnitude of xk with k = 1, 2 is less than or equal to one-half. We stress that the operator-representation (42)\ndiffers from Eq.(17) we used in our analysis (in that case, the magnitude of xk was less or equal to one).\nFor the sake of reasoning, consider two unphysical (tr\u03c1k 6= 1) density matrices given by, \u03c11 = \u03b11 I + x1 *\u03c3 and, \u03c12 =\ndef p\ndef\n\u03b12 I + x2 *\u03c3, where \u03b12k = x2k + b2k ad, bk = det \u03c1k . Then, the Bures distance between \u03c11 and \u03c12 reads [12],\n3p\nd2Bures (\u03c11 , \u03c12 ) = 2 (\u03b11 + \u03b12 ) \u2212 2 2 \u03b11 \u03b12 + x1 * x2 + b1 b2 .\n(43)\nTo connect the Bures distance in (43) to our quantum line element (24), we have to take into consideration two density\n\u03c11 and \u03c12 matrices infinitesimally near to each other. Assume\n\u03c11 =\n\n1\nI + x * \u03c3 and \u03c12 = \u03c11 + d\u03c1.\n2\n\n(44)\n\ndef\n\nwith d\u03c1 = dx * \u03c3. Then, it turns outh that ithe second order expansion of the Bures distance Eq.(43) with \u03c11 and \u03c12\n\u00012\n\u221a\n2\ngiven in Eq.(44) reads ds2Bures = 12 tr (d\u03c1) + d det \u03c1 , that is\nds2Bures = dx * dx+dbdb= dx * dx+\n\n(x * dx)2\n,\n1\n2\n4 \u2212x\n\n(45)\n\nwhere the four coordinates x and b satisfy the normalization condition x2 +b2 = 1/4. Here they come further differences\nwith our analysis carried out in Section IV: our four coordinates are normalized to one. Furthermore, while the set\nof two-dimensional normalized density matrices equipped with the Bures metric is isometric to one closed half of the\nthree-sphere with radius 21 , with our quantum line metric (24) the set of density matrices is isometric to one closed\nhalf of the three-sphere with radius 1.\nIt is straightforward to check that regardless of the chosen metric (our metric (24) or that of Bures (45)), the\ngeometric characterization of the depolarizing channel does not change in its substance. Loosely speaking, the only\nbasic difference is that in the Bures case, we consider deformation properties on a sphere of radius 12 instead of 1. In\nsummary, it can be shown that,\n\"\n#\n\u0003\n\u0003\n\u0002 2\n\u0002 2\n1\n1\n2\n1+\n(46)\ndsBures depolarized \u2264 dsBures not-deformed \u21d4 x \u2264\n\u00012 ,\n4\n1 \u2212 4p\n3\n\nwhich is true since the magnitude of x is less or equal to one-half and where p \u2208 [0, 1] denotes the error probability.\n\n\f7\nVI.\n\nFINAL REMARKS\n\nRelying on the possibility of introducing a Riemannian geometric structure on the space of density operators based\non the statistical concept of distinguishability, we investigated the conceptual usefulness of differential geometric\ntools in quantifying the effect of a noisy depolarizing channel on quantum states by comparing the geometries of the\ninterior of the undeformed and depolarized Bloch spheres related to density operators on a two-dimensional Hilbert\nspace. In particular, we have pointed out that the two main features that characterize the action of the depolarizing\nchannel on density operators, namely the randomization of maximally entangled quantum states (Eq. (14)) and the\nuniform contraction of the deformed Bloch sphere (Eq. (16)) can be both quantified in differential geometric terms.\nRandomization emerges geometrically through a smaller infinitesimal quantum line element on the deformed Bloch\nsphere (Eq. (28)) while the uniform contraction manifests itself via a deformed set of geodesics where the spacial\ncomponents of the deformed four-Bloch vector are simply the contracted versions of the undeformed Bloch vector\ncomponents (Eq. (35)).\nIn agreement with [13], we believe that this preliminary analysis deserves further investigation especially in regard\nto a possible differential geometric quantification of quantum randomness in measurement theory related to a physical\ncharacterization of the Kraus operator-sum decomposition of arbitrary quantum noisy communication channels.\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe Authors thank Giuseppe Marmo for his kind hospitality and for very enlightening discussions during their\nshort visit at the Universit\u00e0 di Napoli \"Federico II\".\n\n[1] T.
