In particular, power generator\nat high temperature in air is highly desirable for waste\nheats from car engines and garbage furnaces. For such\npurposes, thermoelectric devices using oxide ceramics are\nquite promising, but the thermoelectric conversion efficiency is not satisfactory at present.\nAfter the discovery of the good thermoelectric properties of the layered cobalt oxide Nax CoO2 ,2 oxide\nthermoelectrics using transition-metal oxides is extensively investigated for the last decade.3\u20136 Compared with\nother thermoelectric materials, transition-metal oxides\nare quite unique in the sense that (i) the electron correlation is strong enough to make the Heikes formula valid for\nthe thermopower above room temperature,7\u20139 (ii) the resistivity is barely metallic in which the mean free path is\nof the order of the unit cell length, and (iii) the spin fluctuation significantly affects the physical properties.10,11\nAs a result, the thermoelectric parameters cannot be predicted from conventional semiconductor physics.1\nHere we try to clarify how the power factor S 2 \u03c3\nchanges with carrier concentration and temperature in\ntransition-metal oxides, where S and \u03c3 are the thermopower and the conductivity, respectively. Although\nthe thermopower of many transition-metal oxides have\nbeen discussed with the Heikes formula,5,8,12 there are\nonly a few discussions on how the conductivity is described in the same conditions.13\u201316 In particular, we\nwish to address the following two anomalies. First, an\noptimum carrier concentration n0 that maximizes the\npower factor is of the order of 1021 cm\u22123 , and depends\nstrongly on temperature. Second, while the thermopower\nat n0 often depends on materials, the maximized power\nfactor is approximately 2-3 \u03bcW/cmK2 , and is nearly independent of material species. These are seriously incompatible with the \"collective wisdom\" of thermoelectrics,\n\nwhere n0 is of the order of 1019 cm\u22123 , and the optimized thermopower is approximately 2kB /e. To see\nthese two anomalies we will take La1\u2212x Srx CoO3 as a\ntypical example. The doped LaCoO3 has been extensively investigated as a possible candidate for thermoelectric oxide,17\u201320 and the thermoelectric parameters have\nbeen systematically measured in a wide range of carrier\nconcentration.21\u201323 Iwasaki et al.23 have measured the\nthermoelectric parameters using sixteen polycrystalline\nsamples of La1\u2212x Srx CoO3 from x = 0 to 0.40 in a wide\nrange of temperature from 77 to 1100 K. Their comprehensive study offers a good example to test the idea discussed in the present paper. We discuss a possible value\nof the figure of merit for such materials at high temperatures.\nII.\n\nTHEORETICAL BACKGROUND\n\nLet us briefly summarize the conventional thermoelectrics by following Mahan's review article.1 According to the Boltzmann equation, the thermopower S can\nbe written with the Fermi-Dirac distribution f0 and the\nchemical potential \u03bc by\nR \u0010 \u2202f0 \u0011\nvk2 \u03c4k (\u03b5k \u2212 \u03bc)d3 k\n\u2212 \u2202\u03b5\n1\n\u03b5=\u03b5k\n,\n(1)\nS=\nR \u0010 \u2202f0 \u0011\neT\nv 2 \u03c4 d3 k\n\u2212\n\u2202\u03b5\n\n\u03b5=\u03b5k\n\nk k\n\nwhere \u03b5k , vk and \u03c4k are the energy, velocity and scattering time for an electron with a wavevector of k, respectively. We can also express the carrier density n as\nZ\nd3 k\nn=2\nf0 (\u03b5k ).\n(2)\n(2\u03c0)3\nLet us evaluate Eqs. (1) and (2) at high temperatures.\nThe Fermi-Dirac distribution function f0 can be approximated as the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution as\nf0 =\n\n1\n\u223c exp(\u03b2\u03bc \u2212 x),\nexp(x \u2212 \u03b2\u03bc) + 1\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03b2 = 1/kB T and x = \u03b5k /kB T . Now we can evaluate\nthe integrals in Eqs. (1) and (2), by assuming a single\n\n\f2\nband with a parabolic dispersion. Then we get n as\nn=\n\n1\n\u03c02\n\n\u0012\n\n2mkB T\n~2\n\n\u00133/2 \u221a\n\u03c0\nexp(\u03b2\u03bc)\n2\n\n(4)\n\nFor many practical cases, this equation determines the\nchemical potential \u03bc as a function of n and T as\n\u0012 \u0013\nn\n,\n\u03bc = kB T ln\n\u03be\n\n(5)\n\n\u00133/2\n\u221a \u0012\n1 \u03c0 2mkB T\n.\n\u03c02 2\n~2\n\n(6)\n\n! \"\n\nwhere\n\u03be\u2261\n\nIn the same way, we evaluate the thermopower as\nR\nkB d3 k vk2 \u03c4k (\u03b2\u03bc \u2212 x) exp(\u03b2\u03bc \u2212 x)\nR\nS=\u2212\ne\nd3 k vk2 \u03c4k exp(\u03b2\u03bc \u2212 x)\nkB\n= \u2212 (\u03b2\u03bc \u2212 hxi),\ne \u0012 \u0012 \u0013\n\u0013\nn\nkB\nln\n\u2212 hxi\n(7)\n=\u2212\ne\n\u03be\nwhere hxi is the average of x with a weight function of\nvk2 \u03c4k exp(\u03b2\u03bc\u2212 x). Note that we used Eq. (5) to eliminate\n\u03bc. Now we can get the optimum condition of the power\nfactor by differentiating it with n. By neglecting the\ncarrier-concentration dependence of the mobility, we get\ni\nd(S 2 \u03c3)\nd h\nn(ln(n/\u03be) \u2212 hxi)2 = 0.\n\u221d\ndn\ndn\n\n(8)\n\nThen the optimum carrier concentration n0 should satisfy\nln\n\n\u0012\n\nn0\n\u03be\n\n\u0013\n\n= hxi \u2212 2.\n\n(9)\n\nBy eliminating hxi from Eq. (7), we get the optimum\nthermopower S0 as\nS0 =\n\nkB\ne\n\n\u0012\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0013\n2kB\nn0\n\u2212 ln\n+ hxi =\n\u03be\ne\n\n(10)\n\nThis indicates that the optimum thermopower is universal and independent of materials parameters. Using realistic parameters for x, we can evaluate n0 to be of the\norder of 1019 cm\u22123 at 300 K. In fact, the conventional\nthermoelectric materials are optimized around this carrier concentration, and show a thermopower of \u00b1 200\n\u03bcV/K that is close to \u00b12kB /e = \u00b1170 \u03bcV/K. Very recently, Pichanusakorn and Bandaru24 have performed a\nsimilar but more extensive calculation, and have found\nthat the optimized thermopower is always in a limited\nrange of 130\u2013187\u03bcV/K, which is essentially independent\nof material parameters.\n\nFIG. 1. (Color online) The power factor of polycrystalline\nsamples of La1\u2212x Srx CoO3 measured by Iwasaki et al.23 plotted as a function of Sr concentration x.\nIII.\n\nPOWER FACTOR FOR DISORDERED\nSYSTEMS\n\nAccording to Eq.\n(9), n0 is proportional to\nT 3/2 exp(hxi\u22122), meaning that the optimum carrier concentration is higher for higher temperatures. This is not\ntrue in real transition-metal oxides. Figure 1 shows the\npower factor of polycrystalline samples of La1\u2212x Srx CoO3\nmeasured by Iwasaki et al.23 as a function of Sr concentration x for several temperatures. The optimum Sr\nconcentration x0 depends clearly on temperature. This\nis reasonable, because Eq. (8) is based on the assumption that the mobility is independent of carrier concentration. In real materials, however, the mobility is highly\ndependent on carrier concentration especially near metalinsulator transitions.\nLet us have a closer look at the temperature dependence of the optimum Sr concentration x0 . While x0 is\naround 0.12 (corresponding to n =2\u00d71021 cm\u22123 ) at 200\nK, x0 shifts to lower x with increasing temperature. The\npower factor at 350 K shows a plateau from x = 0.04\nto 0.1, which is understood from two broad maxima located near x =0.04 and 0.1. In this context, x0 gradually decreases with temperature from x0 =0.12 at 200 K,\nthrough 0.1 at 300 K, to 0.04 at 400 K.\nLet us discuss an origin for the temperature dependence of x0 . In La1\u2212x Srx CoO3 , the thermopower from\n200 to 400 K are weakly dependent on temperature.\nAs is widely known, the temperature-independent thermopower has been analyzed using the Heikes formula.7\nIn this formula, entropy per site is associated with the\nthermopower. In a simplest case, the thermopower of\nthe Heikes formula SH can be given by\nSH =\n\nkB\n2x\nln\n,\ne\n1\u2212x\n\n(11)\n\nwhere x is the carrier concentration per unit cell.

(14) (dotted curve). plotted as\na function of carrier concentration per unit cell. The power\nfactors at 200 and 400 K in Fig.1 are also plotted.\n\nformula is valid, when the thermal energy kB T is much\nlarger than the transfer energy t but much smaller than\nthe on-site Coulomb repulsion U (t \u226a kB T \u226a U ).\nAlthough the spin and orbital degrees of freedom exist in the Co ions, we neglect in the present paper to\navoid the controversy of the spin states of the doped\nLaCoO3 .22,25,26\nIn the same condition, we should employ the conductivity for nonmetallic conduction. One extreme case is\nknown as the Ioffe-Regel limit, where the electron mean\nfree path is close to the lattice parameters. In this picture, the Ioffe-Regel conductivity \u03c3IR is given by\n\u03c3IR = 0.33x2/3\n\ne2\n,\n~a\n\n(12)\n\nwhere a is the lattice parameter.27 Thus the power factor\nis written as\n\u00152\n\u0014\n2x\n2\n.\n(13)\nSH\n\u03c3IR \u221d x2/3 ln\n1\u2212x\nAnother extreme case is the electrical conduction near\nthe Anderson transition. In this case, the conductivity\n\u03c3A goes toward zero critically as \u03c3A \u221d (n \u2212 nc )p , when\nn approaches the critical concentration nc . When the\ncritical regime is sufficiently large, we get \u03c3A \u221d np for\nn \u226b nc . In this case, the power factor is written as\n\u0014\n\u00152\n2x\n2\np\nSH \u03c3A \u221d x ln\n.\n(14)\n1\u2212x\nFigure 2 shows the normalized power factors calculated\nfrom Eqs. (13) and (14), together with the experimental\n\ndata shown in Fig.1, where the properly normalized values of xp [ln 2x/(1 \u2212 x)]2 is plotted for p = 2/3 [Eq. (13)]\nand for p = 2 [Eq. (14)] by the solid and dotted curves,\nrespectively. As is clearly seen by the dotted curve in\nFig. 2, the exponent of p = 2 well explains the power\nfactor measured at 200 K. This suggests that the mobility is proportional to x, which is consistent with the\nmobility at 300 K evaluated by Iwasaki et al.23 This doping dependent mobility is the reason why the optimum\ncarrier concentration is much larger than the value given\nby Eq. (9). At higher temperature, in contrast, all the\nsamples tend to show \u03c3IR called resistivity saturation,27\nand the solid curve explains the measured data at 400 K\nfor x > 0.03. It is reasonable that the measured data is\nbelow the solid curve for x \u2264 0.03, because at such low\ncarrier concentration, strong localization takes place to\nmake the conductivity lower than \u03c3IR .\nLooking at Eqs. (13) and (14), one can understand\nwhy the thermoelectric performance of the thermoelectric oxides is poor at room temperature, but is comparable to that of other materials above 1000 K. The\nlow-temperature mobility is poorer for lower carrier concentration, and the conductivity \u03c3A is much lower than\nthat of the conventional thermoelectric materials. On the\nother hand, when Eq. (13) is valid, the resistivity and\nthermopower become independent of temperature. For\nx = 0.02 and a = 5\u00c5, for example, we have \u03c3IR =100\nS/cm and SH =300 \u03bcV/K. Then the power factor equals\n9 \u03bcW/cmK2 . Note that the value of 9 \u03bcW/cmK2 is the\nupper limit for materials in which the Heikes formula is\nvalid. It is thus reasonable to regard this value as close\nto the observed maximum power factor of 2-3 \u03bcW/cmK2\nin Fig. 1. Assuming a low thermal conductivity \u03ba of 10\n2\nmW/cmK, we estimate the figure of merit Z = SH\n\u03c3IR /\u03ba\n\u22124\n\u22121\nto be 9\u00d710\nK , which gives ZT = 0.9 at 1000 K.\nThe thermoelectric parameters of the layered cobalt oxides roughly meet the above conditions.28\u201333 A prime example is Ca3 Co4 O9 ; At 1000 K, a single crystal shows\na power factor of 26 \u03bcW/cmK2 with a resistivity of 2.4\nm\u03a9cm and a thermopower of 250 \u03bcV/K,31 and a ceramic\nsample shows a power factor of 6 \u03bcW/cmK2 with a resistivity of 9 m\u03a9cm and a thermopower of 230 \u03bcV/K.33\nWe should further emphasize that the above estimation\nis done in the limit of low mobility. This is also incompatible against the collective wisdom of thermoelectrics,\nwhere high-mobility semiconductors are required for high\nZT values. Equation (13) warrants that highly disordered materials can be fairly good thermoelectric materials at high temperature.\nAnother feature of Eq. (13) is that the solid curve in\nFig. 2 indicates that the power factor has a broad maximum around 0.01-0.06. This is because \u03c3IR is weakly\ndependent on x so that the increase in SH compensates\nthe decrease in \u03c3IR well. Equation (11) gives 340 and\n170 \u03bcV/K for x = 0.01 and 0.06, respectively, and materials with a thermopower larger than 300 \u03bcV/K should\nbe designed to maximize the power factor. In fact, the\nthermopower for x = 0.03 is 300 \u03bc V/K at 400 K.\n\n\f4\nThis is again seriously incompatible with the prediction\nof Eq. (10) that the optimized thermopower is always\n2kB /e =170 \u03bcV/K.\nKobayashi et al.34 have reported that the power factor\nof the misfit layered cobalt oxides [Bi2 A2 O4 ][CoO2 ]b1 /b2\nis nearly independent of materials at 300 K. By changing the block layer, they controlled the carrier concentration, and concomitantly changed the resistivity and thermopower from sample to sample. An important finding\nis that the power factor at 300 K is close to 2 \u03bcW/cmK2\nfor all the samples measured. We think this dopingindependent power factor is essentially understood with\nEq. (13).\nThe present work suggests that the thermopower of\ntransition-metal oxides can be increased up to 340 \u03bcV/K\nwith remaining the power factor unchanged, when the\ntransport parameters are explained with the Heikes formula. By using such oxides, one can reduce the number\nof thermocouple without deteriorating the performance\nof the device. Such devices are easier to fabricate, easier\nto lower contact resistance, and easier to take impedance\nmatching because of its high impedance. We hope that\nwe can increase the yielding ratio and the reliability as\nwell by using such devices. Recently, Bonetti et al.35 have\nreported that a huge thermopower of 7 mV/K around 3045\u25e6 C for some electrolytes, and argued the same idea.\nIV.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nWe have discussed the high-temperature power factor\nof disordered materials using the Heikes formula for the\n\n\u2217\n1\n2\n\n3\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\n12\n\nEmail me at: terra@cc.nagoya-u.ac.jp\nG.

We have found that this power factor can be as\nlarge as 9 \u03bcW/cmK2 (a resistivity of 10 m\u03a9cm and a\nthermopower of 300 \u03bcV/K) at any temperatures, which\ncould give a reasonable value of ZT = 0.9 at 1000 K\nwith a realistic value of the thermal conductivity of 10\nmW/cmK. We have further found that this power factor\ntakes a broad maximum for a wide range of carrier concentration from 0.01 to 0.06 per unit cell. Since this carrier concentration range corresponds to a thermopower\nfrom 170 to 340 \u03bcV/K, a thermopower larger than 300\n\u03bcV/K is applicable for a thermoelectric power generator\nusing transition-metal oxides.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThe author wish to thank Y.
