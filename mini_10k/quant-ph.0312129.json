Possible experimental realizations range from single atoms or ions [9, 10] in microscopic super cavities to\nseveral thousand [11, 12] or up to a million atoms [5, 13]\nin a high Q ring cavity. Applications of these systems\ninclude possible implementations of quantum information processing setups [14, 15], and controlled nonclassical light sources [16, 17] as well as new possibilities for\ntrapping and cooling of atoms and molecules. The basic\nphysical mechanism in these setups can be traced back\nto the backaction of the atoms on the field. They act as\na moving refractive index and absorber, modifying the\nintensity and phase of the intracavity field, which in turn\ngoverns their motion. This coupled dynamics is at the\nheart of cavity enhanced trapping and cooling.\nIt is clear that if a single atom is able to change the\nfield, it will influence other atoms in the same field irrespective of their distance. This introduces long range\natom-atom interactions, which are widely tailorable by\nsuitable choices of cavity geometries and operating conditions. On one hand these interactions are useful and\ncan be used to implement bipartite quantum gates [14].\nOn the other hand they play a decisive role in the scaling\nproperties of cavity enhanced cooling [18, 19]. For perfectly correlated atoms, the change of refractive index\ninduced by one atom can be compensated by a second\natom, so that the effective atom-field back reaction can\nbe strongly reduced. For several atoms in a ring cavity\nthis effect only allows a weak damping of relative motion, while the center of mass motion is strongly damped\n[20]. This model is closely related to the so-called CARL\nlaser, where the kinetic energy of an atomic beam leads\nto gain into the counterpropagating mode of a single side\npumped ring resonator [21]. New effects were also found\nin the study of the coupling of two Bose-condensates in\n\na cavity [22].\nSeveral limiting cases for N atoms commonly interacting with a cavity mode have already been studied.\nFor the case of N strongly trapped atoms in a standing\nwave cavity mode, it is possible to derive a set of coupled equations for the total kinetic and potential energy\nas well as the field amplitude [23], which exhibit collective, damped oscillations ending in highly correlated\nsteady states. This approach, however, does not give\nmuch insight into the details of the individual dynamics\nand correlations. In the opposite limit of N untrapped\natoms moving in the cavity field, numerical simulations\nshow little influence of atom-atom correlations and cooling proceeds independent of the atom number [18] for\nproper rescaling of the cavity parameters.\nRecently an approach for several atoms in a single\nmode cavity has been developed, which concentrates on\nthe effect of the N \u2212 1 other particles on the cooling\nproperties of a single one [19]. This, in principle, makes\nit possible to study the combined optical potential and\nfriction forces. It has been recently proposed theoretically [24] and confirmed experimentally [25], that if the\natoms are pumped directly from the side (as opposed to\npumping the cavity), the buildup of spatial correlations\nwithin a cloud of trapped atoms can lead to superradiant light scattering and enhanced cooling behavior. The\ntheoretical results in this case are based on numerical\nsimulations of the semiclassical equations of motion for\na large number N \u226b 1 of particles [24]. This clearly\ndemonstrates collective effects, but does not give much\nquantitative insight in the buildup and role of atom-atom\ncorrelations.\nThe central goal of the present work is to study the\nbasic physical mechanisms responsible for the motional\ncorrelations and to develop quantitative measures of the\nestablished steady state correlation. For this we restrict\nourselves to the simplest nontrivial example, namely two\natoms strongly coupled to a single standing wave field\nof a cavity.

Moreover, the\nmotion of the atoms is only followed along the cavity\naxis. As we will see, this contains most of the essential\nphysics but still allows us to derive analytical expressions\nfor many relevant quantities. Most of the analytical results are valid for the more general N -atom case.\nThe article is organized as follows: after presenting our\nmodel and the approximations used in section II, we analytically discuss the central physical mechanisms present\nin section III. In section IV we quantify the results using\nnumerical simulations, which are then analyzed in more\ndetail in section V.\n\nII.\n\nTHE MODEL\n\nLet us start by outlining the system which is shown in\nFig. 1. We consider N = 2 two-level atoms with transition frequency \u03c9A strongly coupled to a single mode\nof a high-finesse cavity with frequency \u03c9C . The system\nis driven by a coherent laser field of frequency \u03c9 and\namplitude \u03b7 injected into the cavity through one of the\nmirrors. The model and its theoretical treatment follow\nclosely Ref. [1]. Coupling to the environment introduces\na damping via two channels. First, the atoms spontaneously emit with a rate of 2\u03b3 into the vacuum outside\nthe cavity. Second, the cavity photons decay with rate 2 \u03ba\nvia the output coupler mirror of the cavity. The atoms\ncan move freely in the cavity, however, for the sake of\nsimplicity, their motion is restricted to the cavity axis\n(dashed line in Fig. 1).\nApplying the standard Born-Markov approximation\nthe dynamics are governed by a quantum master equation,\ni\n\u03c1\u0307 = \u2212 [\u0124, \u03c1] + L\u03c1.\n~\n\n(1)\n\nUsing rotating-wave and dipole approximations the\nHamiltonian and the Liouville operators in an interac-\n\n\u03c3\u0302k\u2020 \u03c3\u0302k \u033a\u02c6 \u2212\n\n\u0011\n\u033a\u02c6\u03c3\u0302k\u2020 \u03c3\u0302k .\n\n(2b)\n\nThe atomic and cavity field detunings are defined as\n\u2206A = \u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9A and \u2206C = \u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9C , respectively. The annihilation and creation operators of the cavity field are\n\u00e2 and \u00e2\u2020 , while \u03c3\u0302k and \u03c3\u0302k\u2020 are the lowering and raising\noperators of the k-th atom. The Hamiltonian consists\nof the motional and internal energy of the atoms, the\nself-energy of the cavity field, the classical (laser) pump,\nand the Jaynes\u2013Cummings-type interaction between the\natoms and the field. The position dependence of the coupling constant is due to the spatial structure of the field\nmode: g(xk ) = g0 f (xk ), where in our standing-wave cavity f (xk ) = cos(kC xk ), with kC = 2\u03c0/\u03bb being the cavity wavenumber. The Liouvillean operator includes the\neffect of cavity losses and of the spontaneous emissions\non the combined atom-cavity field density operator \u033a\u02c6.\nThis latter is given by the last term, where the integral\ngoes over the directions of photons spontaneously emitted by the atomic dipole, having expected wavenumber\nkA = \u03c9A /c and angular distribution N (u).\nWe consider cold atoms but with a temperature well\n2\nabove the recoil limit kB Trec = ~kA\n/(2M ), where M is\nthe mass of one atom. In this limit the atomic coherence\nlength is smaller than the optical wavelength and the\nposition and momentum of the atoms can be replaced by\ntheir expectation values and treated as classical variables.\nWe still keep the quantum nature of the internal variables\n\u00e2 and \u03c3\u0302k . Moreover, if the atoms move much less than a\nwavelength during the equilibration time of the internal\nvariables\nv \u226a \u03bb\u03ba, \u03bb\u03b3,\n\n(3)\n\nwe can adiabatically separate the \"fast\" internal from\nthe \"slow\" external dynamics as in standard laser cooling\nmodels [26].\n\nA.\n\nThe internal dynamics\n\nFor given positions of the atoms xk the internal\natomic dynamics can be rewritten in the form of quantum Langevin equations. For low saturation, i.e. when\n\n\f3\n\u03c3\u0302 \u2020 \u03c3\u0302 \u226a 1, we can approximate the operator \u03c3\u0302z by \u22121/2\n(this is called bosonization of the atomic operators). The\nresulting Heisenberg\u2013Langevin equations then reduce to\nthe following set of coupled linear differential equations:\nX\nd\n\u00e2 = (i\u2206C \u2212 \u03ba)a +\ng \u2217 (xk )\u03c3\u0302k + \u03b7 + \u03be\u02c6\ndt\n\n(4a)\n\nk\n\nd\n\u03c3\u0302k = (i\u2206A \u2212 \u03b3)\u03c3\u0302k \u2212 g(xk )\u00e2 + \u03b6\u0302k .\n(4b)\ndt\nThe noise operators \u03be\u02c6 and \u03b6\u0302k appear as a result of the coupling to the external vacuum through the cavity mirrors\nand through spontaneous emission. They contain the annihilation operators of the external vacuum modes, and\ntherefore give 0 when acting on the environment's state.\nTheir second-order correlation functions are as follows:\n\u02c6 1 )\u03be\u02c6+ (t2 )i = 2\u03ba \u03b4(t1 \u2212 t2 ),\nh\u03be(t\n(5a)\n+\nh\u03b6\u0302k (t1 )\u03b6\u0302m\n(t2 )i = 2\u03b3 \u03b4km \u03b4(t1 \u2212 t2 ),\n\n(5b)\n\nwhile all other correlations vanish.\nThe steady state expectation values of the internal variables \u00e2 and \u03c3\u0302k obtained from the Heisenberg\u2013\nLangevin equations (4) then read:\n\u03b3 \u2212 i\u2206A\n(6a)\nD\u2032\ng(xl )\nh\u03c3\u0302l i = \u2212\u03b7\n.\n(6b)\nD\u2032\nHere D\u2032 is the reduced determinant of the Bloch matrix,\nh\u00e2i = \u03b7\n\nD\u2032 = (i\u2206C \u2212 \u03ba)(i\u2206A \u2212 \u03b3) +\n\nX\n\ng(xl )2 .\n\n(7)\n\nSince F\u0302k is normally ordered, its expectation value is easily obtained upon insertion of the stationary solution (6)\nof the internal variables. For a moving atom this expression is only approximately valid: there will be a time lag\nin the internal dynamics with respect to the atom's current position, and hence we will include corrections to F\u0302k\nto first order in the atomic velocities.\nThe slow evolution of the centers of mass of the atoms,\nsmoothed out on the timescale \u03c4 \u2248 max{1/\u03ba, 1/\u03b3} is\ndescribed by the coupled Langevin equations:\n\u1e8bk = pk /M,\n\u1e57k = fk +\n\nN\nX\n\n(12a)\n\u03b2 km pm /M + \u039ek .\n\n(12b)\n\nm=1\n\nD E\nIn these equations fk = F\u0302k are the vectors giving the\nsteady state v = 0 contribution of the force, while \u03b2km\nare the tensors describing the first order corrections to\nthe force acting on atom k. \u039ek denotes the Langevin\nnoise forces due to photon recoil. They correspond to\nrandom kicks along the cavity axis with zero average and\nsecond moments given by h\u039ek \u039em i = Dkm . Note that the\nmatrix Dkm , representing the strength of the Langevin\nnoise, depends on the time-varying atomic positions. It\nrepresents\nE D E of the force due to\nE D fluctuations\nD the quantum\nthe fact F\u0302k \u25e6 F\u0302m 6= F\u0302k \u25e6 F\u0302m . It is by the addition\nof the noise terms \u039ek that we tailor our classical force\nto give the same second-order expectation values as its\nquantum counterpart[1].\n\nl\n\nSince the factor 1/D\u2032 appears in both expectation values\nand in later formulae as well, it is worthwhile to rewrite\nit to reveal its resonance structure with respect to the\ncavity detuning:\n1\n1\n1\n=\n,\n(8)\nD\u2032\n(i\u2206A \u2212 \u03b3) i(\u2206C \u2212 U ) \u2212 (\u03ba + \u0393)\nP 2\nX\n\u2206A l g (xl )\n=\nU\nf 2 (xl ), (9)\nwhere\nU=\n0\n\u22062A + \u03b3 2\nl\nP\nX\n\u03b3 l g 2 (xl )\nand\n\u0393=\n= \u03930\nf 2 (xl ),\n(10)\n\u22062A + \u03b3 2\nl\n\nand we used g(x) = g0 f (x). It is clearly seen that each\natom broadens the resonance at most by \u03930 and displaces\nit by U0 .\nB.\n\nThe external dynamics\n\nThe motion of the atoms is governed by the force operator,\ni\nh\ni\nF\u0302k = [p\u0302, \u0124] = i~ \u2207g(xk ) \u03c3\u0302k\u2020 \u00e2 \u2212 \u2207g \u2217 (xk ) \u00e2\u2020 \u03c3\u0302k .\n~\n(11)\n\nIII.\n\nINTERACTION CHANNELS\n\nThe Hamiltonian (2) contains no direct coupling between the two atoms: these only arise indirectly due to\ncoupling to the same field mode. Interestingly the atomatom interaction appears in all the three types of forces\npresent in classical equations of motion (12). First, the\nsteady state force fk depends on the positions of both\natoms via the steady state intensity. Second, not only\ndoes the friction coefficient on one atom depend on the\nposition of the other, but the friction matrix has offdiagonal terms as well. This means that apart from ordinary viscous friction (\u1e57k \u221d vk ) a strange phenomenon,\nwhich we call cross-friction (\u1e57k \u221d vl , for l 6= k) is also\npresent. Here the velocity of one atom influences the friction experienced by the other atom. Third, the Langevin\nnoise term on one atom has an expected magnitude influenced by the position of the other, and the noise terms\n\u039ek are directly correlated as well. Hence we get joint\n\"kicks\" on both atoms leading to correlated motion. In\nthe following we will analyze these interaction channels\nin more detail.\n\n\f4\nA.\n\nSteady state force f\na)\n\nV [h\u03b3/2\u03c0]\n\nFormally the expectation value fk of the force operator looks very similar to the case of free-space Doppler\ncooling:\n\u2206A\n\u00e2\u2020 \u00e2 \u2207k g 2 (xk ).\n(13)\nfk = \u2212~ 2\n\u2206A + \u03b3 2\nHowever it additionally depends on the positions of the\nother atoms via the cavity field intensity. This dipole\nforce is conservative and can be derived from a potential.\nThe potential looks more complicated than in free space\nas it contains the dynamical nature of the cavity field,\nbut still can be given in closed form [19] :\nP\n2\n\u03b3\u03ba \u2212 \u2206A \u2206C + l g 2 (xl )\n~\u2206A |\u03b7|\nV =\natan\n. (14)\n\u2206A \u03ba + \u2206C \u03b3\n\u2206A \u03ba + \u2206C \u03b3\n\nTo show the effects of dynamic field adjustment, we\nplot this potential for two typical cases in Fig. 2. For the\nexperimental parameters used in an experiment at MPQ\nin Garching [27] (Garching parameters), \u03ba = \u03b3/2, g0 =\n5\u03b3, and for a detuning \u2206A = \u221250\u03b3 (upper graph) the\neffective interaction between the atoms is relatively weak\nand the potential resembles the familiar \"egg-carton\" surface proportional to sin2 (kC x1 )+sin2 (kC x2 ). For a somewhat stronger atom-field coupling g0 = 20\u03b3 (lower graph\nin Fig. 2) the atomic interaction is quite obvious and the\nshape of the potential of the second atom strongly depends on the position of the first atom and vice versa. Basically in this second case either both atoms are trapped,\nor both are free.\nThe peculiar g0 -dependence of the interaction and the\ntrapping effects can be understood physically by looking at formula (13). The atoms see each other through\nthe cavity field \u00e2\u2020 \u00e2 . As we saw in formulae (8,9,10),\nthe field is in resonance when U (x1 , x2 ) is approximately\n\u2206C \u00b1 (\u0393 + \u03ba). Each atom can shift U in this far-detuned\ncase by approximately U0 \u2248 g02 /\u2206A , whereas the cavity\nlinewidth is approximately \u03ba + \u03b3g02/\u22062A . Using the MPQ\nparameters U0 < \u03ba, and therefore the back-action of the\natoms on the cavity field is weak. In the large-g0 case,\nU0 > \u03ba, but \u03930 < \u03ba, meaning that the atoms can shift\nthe cavity resonance significantly more than a linewidth.\nHence if one of the atoms leaves its trap it will shift the\ncavity out of resonance and cause the other atom to be\nreleased as well. Moreover, the amplitude of the force\nis proportional to the cavity field, which in the large-g0\ncase decreases faster with the distance from the trapping\npoint. This implies that less work needs to be done to\nfree an atom: the potential is smaller, despite the same\nmaximum light shift.\nLet us now analyze the interaction in a more quantitative way. We start from the limiting case of neglecting\nthe atomic back-action on the field (i.e. we assume a constant field intensity). This corresponds to the force (13)\n2\n\nfl \u2248\n\n~ |\u03b7|\n\u2207l g 2 (xl )\n2\u2206A \u03ba2\n\n(15)\n\n4\n3.5\n3\n2.5\n2\n1.5\n1\n0.5\n0\n\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n1\n0.8\n0\n\n0.6\n0.2\n\n0.4\nx1 [\u03bb]\n\nx2 [\u03bb]\n\n0.4\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n0.2\n10\n\nb)\n\nV [h\u03b3/2\u03c0]\n\n0.6\n0.5\n\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0\n\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0\n1\n0.8\n0\n\n0.6\n0.2\n\n0.4\nx1 [\u03bb]\n\n0.4\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\nx2 [\u03bb]\n\n0.2\n10\n\nFIG. 2: Potential as a function of atomic positions The potential (14) is plotted as a function of positions of the two\natoms. In a) the Garching parameters (\u03ba = \u03b3/2,g0 = 5\u03b3)\nare used, in b) g0 was increased fourfold. In the first case,\nthe potential is well approximated by a sum of two singleparticle potentials. In the second case, it is seen that either\nboth atoms are trapped or both are free. The trap is deeper\nfor smaller couplings.\n\none obtains in the limit of very large atom-field detuning.\nWe can now find corrections from the cavity-mediated\ninteraction to this force by expanding the potential (14)\nin a power series. Setting the driving field to resonance,\n\u2206C = U0 \u2212 \u03ba, the potential Eq.

Note that since it is not simply the\ndistance of the atoms upon which the potential depends,\n\n\f5\nthe interatomic force between them \u2013 as can be read out\nfrom the above formula \u2013 is not a \"force\" in the sense of\nNewton's third law.\nB.\n\nForces linear in velocity: friction and\ncross-friction\n\nTo lowest order in the adiabatic separation of the internal and external dynamics we used the steady state\nvalues of the internal variables for fixed positions of the\natoms to calculate the above potentials. As a next step\nwe can include corrections for \u00e2 and the \u03c3\u0302k linear in the\nvelocity vm of each atom, which should be valid for low\nvelocities. As described in [1] this leads to a friction matrix \u03b2 km as first order correction to fk .\nWe obtain the following explicit formula for the friction\nmatrix,\n\u03b72\n\n2\u2206A\n\u03b4km\n\u22062A + \u03b3 2\n\u001a\n\u03b72\n1\n+ ~\u2207k g 2 (xk ) \u25e6 \u2207m g 2 (xm )\n*\n2I\n\u2032\nD\u2032 2\n2 |D |\n!)\n!\nX\n\u2032\n2\n2\n2(1 + \u03c7) (i\u2206A \u2212 \u03b3) \u2212\ng(xl ) + (1 + 3\u03c7)D\n\n\u03b2 km = 2~\u2207k g(xk ) \u25e6 \u2207m g(xm )\n\n|D\u2032 |2\n\n\u03b3\n\nl\n\n(17)\n\nwhere \u03c7 = (i\u2206A + \u03b3)/(i\u2206A \u2212 \u03b3) is a complex factor of\nunit modulus, which for large atomic detuning, \u2206A \u226b \u03b3,\nbecomes approximately \u03c7 \u2248 1. This formula differs\nsomewhat from that obtained by Fischer et al. [19] by\na slightly different approach. The most important difference is that we find a matrix symmetric in the indices\nkm. This is important because it is these off-diagonal\nterms that couple the velocities of the atoms, and have\na decisive influence on the buildup of correlated motion.\nWe defer detailed discussion of the formula (17) to Section V.\nC.\n\nRandom forces due to quantum noise\n\nSpontaneous emission and cavity decay introduce\nquantum noise into the atomic motion. These heat up\nthe system and generally tend to decrease motional correlations of the atoms. Following the line of reasoning\nbriefly mentioned at the end of section II and discussed\nin more detail in [1], we can calculate the influence of the\nnoise operators \u03be\u02c6 and \u03b6\u0302 of eq. (4) on the dynamics. For\nN atoms we arrive at the following simple formula:\nDkm = 2~2 \u2207k g(xk ) \u25e6 \u2207m g(xm )\n\n\u03b72\n\n2 \u03b3\u03b4km\n|D\u2032 |\n\u03ba\u2206A + \u03b3\u2206C\n\u03b72\n.\n+ 2~2 \u2207k g(xk )2 \u25e6 \u2207m g(xm )2\n2 \u2206A\n2\n\u2032\n|D |\n|D\u2032 |\n(18)\n\nThis is a simple extension of the corresponding formula\nfor one atom given in [1]. Let us remark here, that the\ndiagonal part of this diffusion matrix Dkm has been also\nfound by Fischer et al. [19]. Surprisingly one also obtains\noff-diagonal terms, which have not been considered before. These terms lead to correlated kicks on the atoms,\nwhich can .add to the atom-atom correlations, rather\nthan destroying them.\nSpontaneous emission adds recoil noise, which gives an\nextra term to the noise correlation matrix of the form:\nsp\n2 2\nu\nDkm\n= \u03b4km 2~2 kA\n\n\u03b7 2 g(x)2\n|D\u2032 |2\n\n\u03b3.\n\n(19)\n\nHere kA = \u03c9A /c is the expected wavenumber of the\nemitted photons and u2 is the correction factor coming\nfrom the spatial distribution of the photons, in our case\nu2 = 2/5. As expected, spontaneous emission, being a\nsingle-atom process, induces no correlations between the\natoms.\nIV.\n\nNUMERICAL SIMULATIONS OF THE\nCORRELATED ATOMIC MOTION\n\nHaving discussed the qualitative nature of the combined atom field dynamics, we now turn to numerical\nsimulations for some quantitative answers. We numerically integrate the Langevin equations (12), varying the\nratio of the cavity loss rate to the linewidth of the atom\n\u03ba/\u03b3 as well as the relative coupling strength g0 /\u03b3. Note\nthat the relative magnitude of radiation pressure and\ndipole force can be changed by varying the detuning between pump frequency and the atomic resonance. As we\nare interested in cooling and trapping the atoms we fix\nthe cavity frequency at \u2206C = N U0 \u2212 \u03ba to ensure efficient cooling [1, 28]. The pump power is always chosen\nto keep the atomic saturation low and approximately at\n( \u03c3\u0302k+ \u03c3\u0302k < 0.1) at all times.\nTypical trajectories of atom pairs are \u0001shown in Figure\n3. The atomic positions x1 (tn ), x2 (tn ) are plotted at\nregular time intervals tn . For better visibility the coordinate is always measured from the nearest trapping point.\nIn the left column the detuning was chosen (\u2206A = \u221250\u03b3),\nwith the cavity parameters of the MPQ group at Garching [27] (\u03ba = \u03b3/2, g0 = 5\u03b3). The first 50\u03bcs are displayed\nin the figure on the top, and the first 3ms in the one on\nthe bottom. Both atoms localize during the first 50\u03bcs\nto within 1/4 of a wavelength around respective trapping centers, a sign of cooling and trapping by the cavity. In the right column, the detuning is chosen much\nlarger (\u2206A = \u2212104 \u03b3) with stronger atom-field coupling\n(\u03ba = \u03b3/10, g0 = 10\u03b3). In this case the relative importance of spontaneous emission is strongly reduced. The\ncooling in the cavity is faster and both atoms reach a\nsteady state rapidly.\nThe appearance of a circular structure is the striking\nfeature of the right column. This indicates that the motion of the atoms is correlated.

In the left\ncolumn, in a) and b), the parameters of the Garching group\nare used, in the right column, in c) and d), we considered\na better resonator (\u03ba = 0.1\u03b3, g0 = 10\u03b3) and larger detuning\n(\u2206A = \u221210000\u03b3).

This is computed\nin the simulation using the trap frequency, which is:\nq\n2 /M ,\n\u03c9trap = 2~ |\u2206A | h\u03c3\u0302 \u2020 \u03c3\u0302i kC\n(20)\n\nif both atoms are well trapped. Here kC is the resonator\nmode wavenumber, and \u03c3\u0302 \u2020 \u03c3\u0302 is the saturation of either\natom at the trapping point. This formula can be derived\nby expanding the potential (14), and substituting our\nparticular choice of \u03b7 and \u2206C .\nThe measured time evolution of the oscillator phases\nfor the MPQ parameters (left column) and the \"improved\" parameters (right column) are shown in Fig. 4.\nFor each parameter set, representative runs shown in\nFig. 3 are used, and the oscillator phases of atom 1 (upper row), atom 2 (middle row) and the phase difference\n(lower row) are displayed. The rapid oscillation of the\natoms (the period is 2.9 \u03bcs for the Garching parameters and 0.17 \u03bcs for the idealized ones) means that the\ntime evolution of the phases is too fast to be followed on\nthe timescale shown, in the upper and middle rows only\n\"noise\" is seen. The phase difference, however, evolves\nmore slowly. This effect is more pronounced for the second parameter set, where the dipole force dominates.\nMoreover, in this second case, the phase difference clearly\n\nFIG. 4: The phases of the atomic oscillations and the relative\nphase. The time evolution of the oscillator phases of the first\n(upper row) and second (middle row) atoms is shown, with\nthe phase difference (bottom row). On the left the parameter\nset of the Garching experiments is used, on the right a better\ncavity is taken with larger atomic detuning, as in the text.\nThe phases of the atoms evolve too fast on this timescale,\nonly noise is seen. The phase difference is slower, with the\n\"improved\" parameter set it appears to stabilize at +90\u25e6 and\n\u221290\u25e6 .\n\nstabilizes around +90\u25e6 or \u221290\u25e6 , with random jumps in\nbetween, as expected from the results shown in Fig. 3.\nWhat is left is to define a single number that quantifies\nthe strength of the time averaged correlations. For this\nwe sample the distributions of the oscillation phases and\nthe phase difference over time to create the histograms\nshown in Fig. 5. As we expect, the distribution of the\nphases is relatively flat for both parameters sets. However, there is a significant difference in the distribution of\nthe relative phase: we find very pronounced peaks around\n+90\u25e6 and \u221290\u25e6 for the second parameter set.\nThe asymmetry in these peaks is a numerical artefact\ndue to the finite sampling time. It is strongly diminished\nif we average over several different initial conditions. A\nparameter that measures the magnitude of the correlation is the width W of these peaks, defined through\nW 2 = (|\u2206\u03c6| \u2212 90\u25e6 )2 , where the overbar denotes averaging over time and over several trajectories with different initial conditions. Subtracting this width from the\nwidth of the flat distribution we get the signal strength\nS = 51.96\u25e6 \u2212 W , which can be obtained directly during\nthe simulation.\nLet us point out here, that this measure S of motional\ncorrelation is useful only if the atoms are well trapped. In\nfact, fast atoms freely moving along the lattice generate\npeaks in the single atom phase distributions of \u03c61 or \u03c62\naround 0\u25e6 or 180\u25e6. We therefore monitor the single atom\ndistributions simultaneously and measure the widths of\nthe peaks around 0\u25e6 and 180\u25e6 in the same way as we\n\n\f7\n200\n\n\u03c61\n\u03c62\n\u03c612\n\nSignal: 2.6\n150\n\nNoise: 2.0\n\n100\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\n\ng0/\u03b3\n\n100\n50\n\n0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 5\n\u03ba/\u03b3 , \u2206A=-50\u03b3\n\na)\n0\n-180\n\n-90\n\n450\nSignal: 19.3\n400\n350\nNoise: 0.0\n300\n250\n200\n150\n100\nb) 50\n0\n-180\n-90\n\n0\n\n90\n\ng0/\u03b3\n\n0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 5\n\u03ba/\u03b3 , \u2206A=-500\u03b3\n\n0\n\n90\n\n180\n\nFIG. 5: The distribution of the phases (\u03a61 , \u03a62 ) and the relative phase (\u03a612 ).

To this end,\nwe ran the simulation program for cavity decay rates of\n1/50 \u03b3 < \u03ba < 5\u03b3 and coupling strengths \u03b3 < g0 < 100\u03b3,\nat atomic detunings of \u2212104\u03b3 < \u2206A < \u221250\u03b3 (at detunings of higher magnitude the atoms move too rapidly\nand adiabaticity does not hold). The results are plotted\nin Fig. 6.\nAt atomic detunings of 100\u03b3 or less, the atoms are\ncooled but generally not trapped by the cavity, except\nfor a small region of g0 < 5\u03b3 and \u03ba < \u03b3. In that case the\nmotion of two atoms will not be correlated. For detunings\nas large as 5000\u03b3, the cavity field traps and cools the\natoms for any considered values of the parameters. The\ncorrelation becomes apparent for g0 > 40\u03ba, and grows\nweaker if g0 is further increased.\n\nB.\n\n0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 5\n\u03ba/\u03b3 , \u2206A=-100\u03b3\n100\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\n\n180\n\u03c61\n\u03c62\n\u03c612\n\nCorrelation and cooling\n\nA decisive advantage of cavity cooling of an atom is the\nfact that it needs little spontaneous emission [28].

At\nsmall detunings |\u2206A | < 100\u03b3 the atoms are cooled but not\ntrapped, correlation cannot be measured. At higher detunings trapping is good enough, and the correlation strength\nmeasured as described in the article is shown in with shades\nof gray.\n\nbeen argued that this is a single atom effect and correlations established between the atoms' motion will decrease\nefficiency or even turn off cooling [23] for a trapped thermal ensemble. On the other hand, in some simulations\nfor very weakly bound atoms, this effect seemed not to\nplay any role [18].\nIn our model we can now study the effect of correlations on cavity cooling in a very controlled way for a large\nrange of parameters. We performed several runs of our\nsimulation with different cavity parameters and at different detunings, comparing the equilibrium temperature\nfor one and two atoms in the cavity. Our results are plotted in Figs. 7 (one atom) and 8 (two atoms). All shades\nof gray show temperatures below Doppler temperature\n~\u03b3, while black denotes temperatures above that value.\nPutting one atom into the cavity (Fig. 7), we find\nthat sub-Doppler cooling is achieved in the good-coupling\nregime g0 > \u03ba, \u03b3. In that regime, the final temperature\ndoes not depend on g0 , but is approximately proportional\nto \u03ba, as expected from previous work [26, 29]. Here one\nhas to be cautious of the results, since if the atom's kinetic energy is only a few times the ground-state energy\nof the harmonic trap potential, the validity of the semiclassical approximation can be questioned.\nInterestingly, the temperature plots look different if we\nload two atoms into the cavity (Fig. 8). At moderately\nlarge detunings, \u2206A = \u221250\u03b3 and \u2206A = \u2212100\u03b3, temperatures are the same as in the single-atom case. In these\ncases the atoms are cooled, but not trapped, by the cavity\nfield. At larger detunings, \u2206A = \u2212500\u03b3 and larger, we\n\n\f8\n100\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\n\ng0/\u03b3\n\n0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 5\n\u03ba/\u03b3 , \u2206A=-50\u03b3\n\n100\n80\n60\ng0/\u03b3\n40\n20\n0\n\ng0/\u03b3\n\n0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 5\n\u03ba/\u03b3 , \u2206A=-500\u03b3\n\n0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 5\n\u03ba/\u03b3 , \u2206A=-5000\u03b3\n\n0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 5\n\u03ba/\u03b3 , \u2206A=-50\u03b3\n100\n80\n60\ng0/\u03b3\n40\n20\n0\n\n0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 5\n\u03ba/\u03b3 , \u2206A=-10000\u03b3\n\nFIG. 7: One atom in the cavity: final temperature vs. \u03ba and\ng0 , for different atomic detunings. Temperature is shown in\nunits of ~\u03b3 with shades of gray. Black denotes temperature\nabove the Doppler limit of ~\u03b3.\n\nsee regions in the plot where \"extra heating\" compared\nto the single-atom case is observed. This effect is most\nprominent at extremely large detunings \u2206A = \u22125000\u03b3\nand \u2206A = \u2212104 \u03b3, where for \u03ba < \u03b3 a new structure appears in the temperature plots. This points to the highly\nreduced efficiency of cavity cooling: whereas for a single\natom a better resonator (lower \u03ba) implies lower final temperature, if there are two atoms in the cavity, decreasing\n\u03ba can increase the temperature.\nComparison of the temperature plots in Figs. 7 and 8\nwith the plots of the correlation strength in Fig. 6 reveals\nstrong similarities. Indeed one sees that the excess heating caused by the presence of the other atom coincides\nwith the buildup of correlations in the motion. In other\nwords, the correlation established between two atoms results in a loss of efficiency of cavity cooling, with final\ntemperatures pushed up to the Doppler limit.\n\nC.\n\n0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 5\n\u03ba/\u03b3 , \u2206A=-100\u03b3\n\n0 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 4 4.5 5\n\u03ba/\u03b3 , \u2206A=-500\u03b3\n1\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0\n\nThe origin of correlation: numerical tests\n\nAs we have seen above, the motion of the atoms becomes correlated due to the cavity-mediated cross-talk.\nThis interaction occurs via the force, via the friction, and\nvia the diffusion as well. We would like to know which of\nthese interaction channels is responsible for the correlation. In our simulation we can conveniently answer this\nquestion if we artificially weaken only particular channels\nof interaction and measure the correlation.\nThe interaction can be eliminated from the deterministic force using the approximation (15).

For large atomic detuning new structures appear in the plots.\n\nhand, cross-friction and cross-diffusion are direct interactions between the atoms. On the other hand \u2013 through\nthe determinant D\u2032 \u2013 the positions of both atoms influence the friction and diffusion constants for the other\natoms. This parametric interaction was not analyzed,\nbut does not seem to play a prominent role. Both crossfriction and cross-diffusion can be eliminated by simply\nsuppressing the off-diagonal terms in the friction and diffusion matrices.\nThe elimination of the interaction can be made continuous with mixing parameters 0 \u2264 yF , y\u03b2 , yD \u2264 1, giving\nthe force, the friction, and the diffusion with the following formulae:\nF \u2032 = yF F + (1 \u2212 yF )F0 ,\n\u2032\n\u03b2km\n= y\u03b2 \u03b2km + \u03b4km (1 \u2212 y\u03b2 )\u03b2km ;\n\u2032\nDkm = yD Dkm + \u03b4km (1 \u2212 yD )Dkm .\n\n(21)\n(22)\n(23)\n\nWe show an example of what this gives for detuning\n\u2206A = \u22125000\u03b3, decay rate \u03ba = 0.5\u03b3 and coupling\ng0 = 30\u03b3 in Fig. 9. The results of these investigations\nare quite unanimous. It can be seen that linearization\nof the potential has no systematic effect on correlation\nstrength, and correlations are slightly enhanced if the\nnoise is decorrelated. If cross-friction is eliminated, however, all correlations disappear. We can therefore conclude that the dominant effect leading to correlated motion is related to cross-friction.\n\n\fMeasured correlation\n\n9\nIn the well-trapped case we can write the friction and\ndiffusion matrices to second order in the coordinates xl\nas:\n\n14\n12\n10\n8\n6\n4\n2\n0\n-2\n-4\n-6\n\n\u03b2km = \u03b20 \u03b4km + \u03b21 xk xm ,\nDkm = D0 \u03b4km + D1 xk xm .\n\nyF\ny\u03b2\nyD\n0\n\n0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.9\n\n1\n\nInteraction strength\n\nFIG. 9: Correlation for various interaction channel strengths.\nThe interaction via the conservative, the friction, and the diffusion forces is weakened by the mixing ratios yF , y\u03b2 and yD ,\nas described in the text.

THE ORIGIN OF CORRELATION:\nANALYTICAL EXPANSION FOR DEEP\nTRAPPING\n\nThe emergence of motional correlations between\ntrapped atoms can be examined analytically using the\nformulas presented in Section III. Both friction and diffusion matrices have an \"isotropic\" term proportional to\n\u03b4km , which acts on each atom separately, and an \"interaction\" term, containing cross-friction and cross-diffusion.\nThe latter can be rewritten in the following form, using\nthe notation gk = g(xk ):\n\u0001\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n2\n\u22071 g12 * * * \u2207N gN\n\u22071 g12\n2\n2~\u03b7\n\uf8ec .. \uf8f7\n, (24)\n. \uf8f8\u25e6\n2 P ({xl }) \uf8ed\n|D\u2032 |\n2\n\u2207N gN\nwhere the prefactor P depends on the positions of all\natoms symmetrically.\nFor well-trapped atoms xk \u226a \u03bb (xk denoting the distance of atom k from the nearest trapping site), the coupling constants can be approximated as\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 2 2\ngk = g(xk ) = g0 cos(kC xk ) \u2248 g0 1 \u2212 kC\nxk . (25)\n2\nSubstituting these into the interaction parts of the matrices (24) yields:\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\u0001\nx1 /r\nx1 /r * * * xN /r\n2\n8~\u03b7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\n..\n4 4 2\n,\n2 P ({xl })g0 kC r \uf8ed . \uf8f8 \u25e6\n|D\u2032 |\nxN /r\n(26)\nP 2 \u0001 12\nwhere the \"radius\", r =\n, is the distance of the\nl xl\nsystem from the origin in the coordinate space.

(7), evaluated at the trapping site. Near the trapping\nsite all xk go to zero, and only D0 remains finite. This\nprevents the atoms from stopping completely: they are\n\"heated out\" from the trapping sites themselves. At some\ndistance from the trapping sites the interaction terms\nbecome important as well, in the coordinate space this\ninduces extra diffusion and friction in the radial direction.\nProvided g0 is high enough, radial friction is enhanced\nmuch more than radial diffusion, leading to a \"freezing\nout\" of the radial mode, i.e. a motion at approximately\nconstant distance from the origin.\n\nVI.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nAs pointed out in several previous papers, the motion\nof particles in a cavity is coupled quite generally through\nthe field mode. This implies the buildup of motional correlations, which we have investigated here in more detail.\nIn general we found that in steady state these correlations are hard to see directly and it is difficult to find\ngood qualitative measures to characterize them. Mostly\nthey are strongly perturbed by various diffusion mechanisms. However, they still play an important role in\nthe dynamics and thus can be observed indirectly. As\none consequence they can lead to a significant change\n(increase) in the steady temperature, which directly relates to trapping times and localization properties. This\nposes limits to cavity induced cooling for large particle\nnumbers.\nFrom the various mechanisms at work, cross-friction\nturns out to be the most important. It creates correlation and leads to a fast thermalization of two distant\n\n\f10\nparticles without direct interaction. Hence, this mechanism should prove vital for the implementation of sympathetic cooling of distant ensembles coupled by a far\noff-resonant cavity field. In order to get efficient coupling the two species should have comparable oscillation\nfrequencies, so that correlation buildup and thermalization is fast. The finesse of the cavity should also be large\n(long photon lifetime).\nThe second important coupling mechanism, which\nworks via the joint steady state potentials, was suggested\nfor use in the implementation of conditional phase shifts\n[14]. It can be viewed as a cavity-enhanced dipole\u2013dipole\ncoupling. Although this contribution will become more\nimportant for larger atom-field detunings, the conditions\nfor this part to dominate the dissipative cross-friction\nseem rather hard to achieve in practice. Finally we found\nthat the noise forces acting on different atoms contain\n\nnonlocal correlations too. These are particularly important for large detunings and relatively low photon numbers, where spontaneous emission is strongly reduced. As\na result they could seriously perturb bipartite quantum\ngates in cavities.\n\n[1] P. Domokos and H. Ritsch, J. Opt. Soc. Am. B 20, 1098\n(2003).\n[2] V. Vuleti\u0107, H. W. Chan, and A. T.
