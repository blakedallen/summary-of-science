This leads to correlations between observables\nof the systems that cannot be understood on the basis of classical (local realistic) theories [1]. Its importance today exceeds the realm of the foundations of quantum physics and entanglement has become an important physical resource, like energy, that allows performing communication and computation tasks with efficiency\nwhich is not achievable classically [2].\nIn the near future we will certainly see more and more\nexperiments on entanglement of increasing complexity.\nMoving to higher entangled systems or entangling more\nsystems with each other, will eventually push the realm of\nquantum physics well into the macroscopic world. It will\nbe therefore important to investigate under which conditions entanglement within or between \"macroscopic\"\nobjects, each consisting of a sample containing a large\nnumber of the constituents, can arise.\nRecently, it was shown that macroscopic entanglement\ncan arise \"naturally\" between constituents of various\ncomplex physical systems. Examples of such systems are\nchains of interacting spin systems [2, 3], harmonic oscillators [4, 5] and quantum fields [6]. Entanglement can have\nan effect on the macroscopic properties of these systems\n[7, 8, 9] and can be in principle extractable from them\nfor quantum information processing [6, 10, 11, 12].\nWith the aim of better understanding macroscopical\n\nentanglement we will investigate entanglement between\ncollective operators in this paper. A simple and natural\nsystem is the ground state of a linear chain of harmonic\noscillators furnished with harmonic nearest-neighbor interaction. The mathematical entanglement properties of\nthis system were extensively investigated in [4, 5, 13, 14].\nEntanglement was computed in the form of logarithmic\nnegativity for general bisections of the chain and for contiguous blocks of oscillators that do not comprise the\nwhole chain. It was shown that the log-negativity typically decreases exponentially with the separation of the\ngroups and that the larger the groups, the larger the maximal separation for which the log-negativity is non-zero\n[4]. It also was proven that an area law holds for harmonic lattice systems, stating that the amount of entanglement between two complementary regions scales with\ntheir boundary [15].\nIn a real experimental situation, however, we are typically not able to determine the complete mathematical amount of entanglement (as measured, e.g., by lognegativity) which is non-zero even if two blocks share\nonly one arbitrarily weak entangled pair of oscillators.\nOur measurement apparatuses normally cannot resolve\nsingle oscillators, but rather interact with a whole bunch\nof them in one way, potentially even in non-contiguous\nregions, thus measuring certain global properties. Here\nwe will study entanglement between \"physical blocks\" of\nharmonic oscillators - existing only if there is entanglement between the collective operators defined on the\nentire blocks - as a function of their size, relative distance and the coupling strength. Our aim is to quantify\n(experimentally accessible) entanglement between global\nproperties of two groups of harmonic oscillators. Surpris-\n\n\f2\ningly, we will see that such collective entanglement can\nbe demonstrated even in the case where none of the oscillators from one block is entangled with an oscillator from\nthe other block (i.e., it cannot be understood as a cumulative effect of entanglement between pairs of oscillators),\nwhich is in agreement with [4]. This shows the existence\nof bipartite entanglement between collective operators.\nBecause of the area law [15] the amount of entanglement is relatively small in the first instance. We suggest\na way to overcome this problem by allowing the collective\nblocks to consist of a periodic sequence of subblocks. Then\nthe total boundary region between them is increased and\nwe verify that indeed a larger amount of entanglement is\nfound for periodic blocks, where the entanglement scales\nat most with the total boundary region. We give an analytical approximation of this amount of entanglement\nand motivate how it can in principle be extracted from\nthe chain [6, 10, 11, 12].\nMethodologically, we will quantify the entanglement\nbetween collective operators of two blocks of harmonic\noscillators by using a measure for continuous variable systems based on the Peres-Horodecki criterion [16, 17, 18,\n19]. The collective operators will be defined as sums over\nlocal operators for all single oscillators belonging to the\nblock. The infinite harmonic chain is assumed to be in\nthe ground state and since the blocks do not comprise\nthe whole chain, they are in a mixed state.\nII.\n\nLINEAR HARMONIC CHAIN\n\nWe investigate a linear harmonic chain, where each\nof the N oscillators is situated in a harmonic potential\nwith frequency \u03c9 and each oscillator is coupled with its\nneighbors by a harmonic potential with the coupling frequency \u03a9. The oscillators have mass m and their positions and momenta are denoted as q i and pi , respectively.\nAssuming periodic boundary conditions (q N +1 \u2261 q 1 ), the\nHamiltonian thus reads [20]\n!\nN\nX\np2j\nm \u03c9 2 q 2j\nm \u03a92 (q j \u2212 q j\u22121 )2\n. (1)\n+\n+\nH=\n2m\n2\n2\nj=1\nWe canonically go to dimensionless variables: qj \u2261 C q j\np\nand pj \u2261 pj /C, where C \u2261 m\u03c9(1 + 2 \u03a92 /\u03c9 2 )1/2 [14].\nBy this means the Hamiltonian becomes\nH=\n\nN\nE0 X 2\n(p + qj2 \u2212 \u03b1 qj qj+1 ) ,\n2 j=1 j\n\n(2)\n\nwith\nthe abbreviations \u03b1 \u2261 2 \u03a92 /(2 \u03a92 + \u03c9 2 ) and E0 \u2261\n\u221a\n2\n2 \u03a9 + \u03c9 2 . The coupling constant is restricted to values 0 < \u03b1 < 1, where \u03b1 \u2192 0 in the weak coupling\nlimit (\u03a9/\u03c9 \u2192 0) and \u03b1 \u2192 1 in the strong coupling limit\n(\u03a9/\u03c9 \u2192 \u221e).\nIn the language of second quantization the positions\nand momenta are converted into operators (qj \u2192 q\u0302j ,\n\npj \u2192 p\u0302j ) and are expanded into modes of their annihilation and creation operators, \u00e2 and \u00e2\u2020 , respectively:\nN \u22121\n\u0002\n\u0003\n1 X\n1\np\nq\u0302j = \u221a\n\u00e2(\u03b8k ) ei \u03b8k j + H.c. ,\nN k=0 2 \u03bd(\u03b8k )\nr\nN \u22121\n\u0003\n\u2212i X \u03bd(\u03b8k ) \u0002\np\u0302j = \u221a\n\u00e2(\u03b8k ) ei \u03b8k j \u2212 H.c. .\n2\nN\n\n(3)\n\n(4)\n\nk=0\n\nHere \u03b8k \u2261 2 \u03c0 k/N (with k = 0, 1, ..., N \u2212 1) \u221a\nis the dimensionless pseudo-momentum and \u03bd(\u03b8k ) \u2261 1 \u2212 \u03b1 cos \u03b8k\nis the dispersion relation.

By means of such a formalism we seek to fulfil\nexperimental conditions and constraints, since finite experimental resolution implies naturally the measurement\nof, e.g., the average momentum of a bunch of oscillators\nrather than the momentum of only one. On the other\nhand, this formalism can easily take account of blocks\nthat consist of non-contiguous regions, leading to interesting results which will be shown below. We want to\npoint out that this convention of the term block is not the\nsame as it is normally used in the previous literature. In\ncontrast to the latter, for which one allows any possible\nmeasurement, our simulation of realizable experiments\nalready lacks some information due to the averaging.\nLet us now consider two non-overlapping blocks of oscillators, A and B, within the closed harmonic chain in\nits ground state, where each block contains n oscillators.\nThe blocks are separated by d \u2265 0 oscillators (Fig. 1).\nWe assume n, d \u226a N and N \u2192 \u221e for the numerical\ncalculations of the two-point correlation functions.\n\n\f3\nA\n\nB\n\nand hence\n[X\u0302i , X\u0302j ] = i \u03a9ij\n\nd\nn\n\nn\n\nFIG. 1: Two blocks of a harmonic chain A and B.

This means that the\nGaussianness of the ground state of the harmonic chain\n(i.e., the fact that the state is completely characterized by\nits first and second moments, see below) was preserved by\nthe (Fourier) transformation to the frequency-dependent\ncollective operators.\nIV. QUANTIFYING ENTANGLEMENT\nBETWEEN COLLECTIVE OPERATORS\n\nIn reality, we are typically not capable of single particle resolution measurements and only of measuring the\ncollective operators with one frequency, namely k = 0.\nNote that in general the correlations of higher-frequency\n(k)\n(k) (k)\ncollective operators, e.g., h (Q\u0302A )2 i or h Q\u0302A Q\u0302B i with\nk 6= 0, are not real numbers. Therefore, as a natural\nchoice, we denote as the collective operators\n1 X\n(0)\nQ\u0302A \u2261 Q\u0302A = \u221a\nq\u0302j ,\nn\n\n(16)\n\nj\u2208A\n\n1 X\n(0)\nP\u0302A \u2261 P\u0302A = \u221a\np\u0302j ,\nn\n\n(17)\n\nj\u2208A\n\nand analogously for block B. It seems to be a very natural situation that the experimenter only has access to\nthese collective properties and we are interested in the\namount of (physical) entanglement one can extract from\nthe system if only the collective observables Q\u0302A,B and\nP\u0302A,B are measured.\nReference [18] derives a separability criterion which is\nbased on the Peres-Horodecki criterion [16, 17] and the\nfact that - in the continuous variables case - the partial\ntransposition allows a geometric interpretation as mirror\nreflection in phase space. Following largely the notation\nin the original paper, we introduce the vector\n\u03be\u0302 \u2261 (Q\u0302A , P\u0302A , Q\u0302B , P\u0302B )\n\n(18)\n\nof collective operators. The commutation relations\nhave \u0010\nthe compact\nform [\u03be\u02c6\u03b1 , \u03be\u0302\u03b2 ] = i K\u03b1\u03b2 with K \u2261\n\u0011\nL2\n0 1\nj=1 \u22121 0 . The separability criterion bases on the covariance matrix (of first and second moments)\nV\u03b1\u03b2 \u2261\n\n1\nh \u2206\u03be\u02c6\u03b1 \u2206\u03be\u02c6\u03b2 + \u2206\u03be\u02c6\u03b2 \u2206\u03be\u02c6\u03b1 i ,\n2\n\n(19)\n\nwhere \u2206\u03be\u02c6\u03b1 \u2261 \u03be\u0302\u03b1 \u2212 h \u03be\u02c6\u03b1 i with h \u03be\u0302\u03b1 i = 0 in our case (state\naround the origin of phase space).\nThe covariance matrix V is real (which would not\nbe the case for higher-frequency collective operators)\nand symmetric: h Q\u0302A Q\u0302B i = h Q\u0302B Q\u0302A i and h P\u0302A P\u0302B i =\nh P\u0302B P\u0302A i, coming from the fact that the two-point correlation functions (5) and (6) only depend on the\n\n\f4\nabsolute value of the position index difference. On\nthe other hand, using (3) and (4), we verify that\nPN \u22121\nh q\u0302i p\u0302j i = i (2 N )\u22121 k=0 exp[i \u03b8k (i \u2212 j)] and h p\u0302j q\u0302i i =\nPN \u22121\n\u2212i (2 N )\u22121 k=0 exp[i \u03b8k (j \u2212 i)]. For i 6= j both summations vanish (\u03b8k \u2261 2 \u03c0 k/N and i, j integer) and for i = j\nthey are the same but with opposite sign. Thus, in all\ncases h q\u0302i p\u0302j i = \u2212 h p\u0302j q\u0302i i.

This measure (negativity) is based\non the Peres-Horodecki criterion [16, 17] and was shown\nto be an entanglement monotone [22, 23]. For covariance\nmatrices of the form (20) it reads [19]\n\u0013\n\u0012\n(\u03b41 \u03b42 )0\n\u22121 ,\n(25)\n\u03b5 = max 0,\n\u03b41 \u03b42\nwhere \u03b41 \u2261 G \u2212 |GAB | and \u03b42 \u2261 H \u2212 |HAB |. In general,\nthe numerator is defined by the square of the Heisenberg\nuncertainty relation\n\u0012\n\u00132\n1\n(\u03b41 \u03b42 )0 \u2261\n|h [Q\u0302A,B , P\u0302A,B ] i| ,\n(26)\n2\nwith (\u03b41 \u03b42 )0 = 1/4 due to (9). We note that \u03b5 is a degree\nof entanglement (in the sense of necessity and sufficiency)\nonly for Gaussian states which are completely characterized by their first and second moments, as for example\nthe ground state of the harmonic chain we are studying.\nHowever, we left out the higher-frequency collective operators (and all the oscillators which are not part of the\nblocks) and therefore, the entanglement \u03b5 has to be understood as the Gaussian part of the amount of entanglement which exists between (and can be extracted from)\nthe two blocks when only the collective properties Q\u0302A,B\nand P\u0302A,B , as defined in (16) and (17), are accessible.\n\nThere also exists an entanglement witness in form of\na separability criterion based on variances, where \u2206 \u2261\nh (Q\u0302A \u2212Q\u0302B )2 i+h (P\u0302A +P\u0302B )2 i = 2 (G\u2212GAB +H+HAB ) <\n2 is a sufficient condition for the state to be entangled\n[24]. We note that the above negativity measure (25)\nis \"stronger\" than this witness in the whole parameter\nspace (\u03b1, n). In particular, there are cases where \u03b5 > 0\nalthough \u2206 \u2265 2. This is in agreement with the finding\nthat the variance criterion is weaker than a generalized\nnegativity criterion [25].\nWe further note that the amount of entanglement\n(25) is invariant under a change of potential redefiniP\ntions of the collective operators, e.g., Q\u0302A \u2261\nj\u2208A q\u0302j\nP\nor Q\u0302A \u2261 (1/n) j\u2208A q\u0302j , as then the modified scaling\nin the correlations (G, GAB , H, and HAB ) is exactly\ncompensated by the modified scaling of the Heisenberg\nuncertainty in the numerator.\nFigure 2 shows the results for d = 0 and d = 1. In the\nfirst case - if the blocks are neighboring - there exists\nentanglement for all possible coupling strengths \u03b1 and\nblock sizes n. In the latter case - if there is one oscillator between the blocks - due to the strongly decaying\ncorrelation functions g an h there is no entanglement between two single oscillators (n = 1), but entanglement for\nlarger blocks (up to n = 4, depending on \u03b1). The statement that entanglement can emerge by going to larger\nblocks was also found in [4]. But there the blocks were\nabstract objects, containing all the information of their\nconstituents. In the case of collective operators, however,\nincreasing the block size (averaging over more oscillators)\nis also connected with a loss of information. In spite of\nthis loss and the mixedness of the state, two blocks can\nbe entangled, although non of the individual pairs between the blocks is entangled - indicating true bipartite\nentanglement between collective operators. For d \u2265 2,\nhowever, no entanglement can be found anymore.\nThese results are in agreement with the general statement that entanglement between a region and its complement scales with the size of the boundary [15].

In the picture d = 1, m = 2, s = 3\nand the number of oscillators per block is n = ms = 6.\n\nthe present case of two blocks in a one-dimensional chain\n(Fig. 1) the boundary is constant and as the blocks are\nmade larger, the entanglement decreases since it is distributed over more and more oscillators. We therefore\npropose to increase the number of boundaries by considering two non-overlapping blocks, where we allow a periodic continuation of the situation above, i.e. a sequence\nof m \u2265 1 subblocks, separated by d oscillators and each\nconsisting of s \u2265 1 oscillators, where ms = n (Fig. 3).\nThe degree of entanglement between two periodic\nblocks of non-separated (d = 0) one-particle subblocks\n(s = 1) is larger for stronger coupling constant \u03b1 and\ngrows with the overall number of oscillators n (Fig. 4a).\nFor given \u03b1 and n and no separation between the subblocks (d = 0) the entanglement is larger for the case of\nsmall subblocks, as then there are many of them, causing\na large total boundary (Fig. 4b). Entanglement can be\neven found for larger separation (d = 1, 2) with a more\ncomplicated dependence on the size s of the subblocks.\nThere is a trade-off between having a large number of\nboundaries and the fact that one should have large subblocks as individual separated oscillators are not entangled (Fig. 4c,d). For d \u2265 3 no entanglement can be found\nanymore. (In a realistic experimental situation, where\nthe separation d is not sharply defined, e.g., where there\nare weighted contributions for d = 0, 1, ..., dmax , entanglement can persist even for dmax \u2265 3, depending on the\nweighting factors.)\nFor the sake of completeness we give a rough approximation of the entanglement between two periodic blocks.\nLet us assume that the subblocks are directly neighbored,\nd = 0. Furthermore, we consider couplings \u03b1 such that\nwe may neglect higher than next neighbor correlations\n(\u03b1 . 0.5), i.e., we only take into account g0 , g1 , h0 and\nh1 .

If \u03a6\u0302L and \u03a0\u0302L\ncorrespond to separated regions without overlap, i.e.,\n|x0 \u2212 y0 | > L, then of course [\u03a6\u0302L (x0 , t), \u03a0\u0302L (y0 , t)] = 0.\nThe spatial integration in (36) and (37) can be carried\nout analytically:\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ \u221e\nkL\n1\ndk\nsin\n\u03a6\u0302L (x0 , t) = \u221a\n\u221a\n2\n\u03c0 L \u2212\u221e k \u03c9k\n\u0002\n\u0003\ni k x0 \u2212i \u03c9k t\n\u00d7 \u00e2(k) e\n+ H.c. ,\n(39)\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ \u221e\n\u221a\ndk \u03c9k\nkL\n\u2212i\nsin\n\u03a0\u0302L (x0 , t) = \u221a\nk\n2\n\u03c0 L \u2212\u221e\n\u0002\n\u0003\ni k x0 \u2212i \u03c9k t\n\u00d7 \u00e2(k) e\n\u2212 H.c. .\n(40)\n\nThe final step is to calculate the propagators of the field\nand the conjugate momentum. We find\n\n(41)\nD\u03a6\u0302,L (r) \u2261 h0| \u03a6\u0302L (x0 , t) \u03a6\u0302L (y0 , t) |0i\n\u0012\n\u0013\nZ \u221e\n1\nkL\ndk\n\u221a\n=\nsin2\ncos(k r) ,\n2\n2\n2\n\u03c0 L \u2212\u221e k k + m\n2\n(42)\nD\u03a0\u0302,L (r) \u2261 h0| \u03a0\u0302L (x0 , t) \u03a0\u0302L (y0 , t) |0i\n\u221a\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ \u221e\n2\n2\nkL\ndk k + m\n1\ncos(k r) ,\nsin2\n=\n2\n\u03c0 L \u2212\u221e\nk\n2\nwith r \u2261 |x0 \u2212 y0 | the distance between the centers of\nthe two regions, reflecting the spatial symmetry. Thus\nD\u03a6\u0302,L (0) and D\u03a0\u0302,L (0) are the analogs of h Q\u03022A,B i and\n2\nh P\u0302A,B\ni (intra-block correlations within the same block),\nrespectively, whereas D\u03a6\u0302,L (r > L) and D\u03a0\u0302,L (r > L) correspond to h Q\u0302A Q\u0302B i and h P\u0302A P\u0302B i (inter -block correlations between separated blocks).\nThe expressions (41) and (42) are finite, especially for\nr = 0. Mathematically, the integration over a finite spatial region L corresponds to a cutoff, which removes the\ndivergence we faced in (35). However, the expressions\nare ill defined for L \u2192 0.\nApplying the entanglement measure (25) with G =\nD\u03a6\u0302,L (0), H = D\u03a0\u0302,L (0), GAB = D\u03a6\u0302,L (r), and HAB =\nD\u03a0\u0302,L (r) does not indicate entanglement for any choice of\nL and r > L. The same is true for the generalized case of\nblocks consisting of periodic subregions of space, showing\nan inherent difference between the harmonic chain and its\ncontinuum limit. We believe this is due to the fact, that\nany spatial integration immediately corresponds to an\ninfinitely large block in the discrete harmonic chain and\nthat the information loss (compared to the mathematical\nindeed existing exponentially small entanglement [6]) due\nto the collective operators already is too large. Nonetheless, defining collective operators like in (36) and (37)\nand use of the measure (25) may reveal entanglement\nbetween spatially separated regions for other quantum\nfield states, which is the subject of future research.\n\n\f7\nVI.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nOur results have importance for investigating the conditions under which entanglement can be detected by\nmeasuring collective observables of blocks consisting of a\nlarge number of harmonic oscillators. This has relevance\nfor schemes of extracting entanglement where the probe\nparticles normally interact with whole (periodic) groups\nof oscillators rather than single oscillators. The results\nare also relevant for the transition from the quantum to\nthe classical domain as they suggest that entanglement\nbetween collective operators (global properties) may persist even in the limit of a large number of particles. It is\nobvious that our approach of collective observables can be\nextended to more dimensions. Furthermore, we demon-\n\n[1] J. S. Bell, Physics (NY) 1, 195 (1964)\n[2] M. A.
