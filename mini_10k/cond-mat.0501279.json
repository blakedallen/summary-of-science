INTRODUCTION\n\nOne of the strongest motivations to investigate magnetic semiconductors and halfmetallic ferromagnets (HMF) is the possibility to design and produce novel stable\nstructures on semiconducting substrates with new interesting properties. Adopting\nthis point of view first-principle studies are an excellent starting point to predict new\nsystems having the desired properties. Recently Akinaga et al. [1] found the possibility\nto fabricate zinc-blende (ZB) type CrAs half-metallic ferromagnetic material. Experimental data confirmed that this material is ferromagnetic with the magnetic moment\nof 3\u03bcB , in agreement with theoretical predictions [1]. According to this calculation this\nhalf-metallic material has a gap of about 1.8eV in the minority spin channel which\nhas attracted much attention to this potential candidate for spintronic applications,\nkeeping in mind also its high Curie temperature Tc around 400K. Note that recent\nexperiments on CrAs epilayers grown on GaAs(001) evidenced an orthorhombic structure, different from the ZB one, so the structure is rather sensitive to the preparation\nprocess [2]. However, it is highly desirable to explore the possibility of existence of\nhalf-metallic ferromagnetism in materials which are compatible with important III-V\nand II-IV semiconductors. For this purpose efforts has been made on the metastable\nZB structures, such as CrAs [1,3]. Beyond the importance of the preparation techniques, attention should be given to the understanding of the finite temperature properties in these HMF materials. Therefore, it is interesting to explore theoretically the\nmechanism behind half-metallic ferromagnetism at finite temperature from a realistic\nelectronic structure point of view.\nTheoretical studies [4] of the 3d transition metal monoarsenides have shown that\nthe ferromagnetic phase of ZB structure CrAs compound should be more stable than\nthe antiferromagnetic one. The calculated equilibrium lattice constant is larger than\nthat of GaAs (5.65\u00c5) having a value of 5.80\u00c5 [4]. Following this work similar electronic\nstructure calculations concerning the stability of the half-metallic ferromagnetic state\nin the ZB structure have been carried out [5].\nHowever standard local density approximation LDA (or GGA, LDA+U, etc.) calculations are in general insufficient to describe some important many-particle features of\nthe half-metallic ferromagnets. One of these many-body features, the non-quasiparticle\n(NQP) states [6\u20138] contribute essentially to the tunneling transport in heterostructures\ncontaining HMF [9,10]. The origin of these states is connected with the \"spin-polaron\"\nprocesses: the spin-down low-energy electron excitations, which are forbidden for HMF\nin the one-particle picture, turn out to be possible as superpositions of spin-up electron excitations and virtual magnons [6,7]. Recently we have applied the LDA+DMFT\n(dynamical mean field theory) approach [11,13] to describe from first principles the\nnon-quasiparticle states in a prototype half-metallic ferromagnet NiMnSb [14].\nIn this paper, we describe the correlation effects in CrAs HMF material in the\nframework of the LDA+DMFT approach. We will show that these many-body spinpolaron processes are very sensitive to structural properties of the artificially produced\nCrAs compound. Depending on the substrate characteristics, such as a large lattice\nconstant, as in the case of InAs (6.06\u00c5), or a smaller one as in the case of GaAs\n(5.65\u00c5) the spectral weight of the non-quasiparticle states can be tuned from a large\n2\n\n\fvalue in the former case (InAs) to an almost negligible contribution in the later case\n(GaAs). Therefore, the correlation effects in conjunction with structural properties\ndetermine the behavior of electronic states in CrAs near the Fermi level which has a\nsubstantial impact on the tunneling transport in the corresponding heterostructures.\nII. TUNNELING TRANSPORT AND NON-QUASIPARTICLE PHYSICS\n\nFirst, let us explain in a simple way why the non-quasiparticle states are important\nfor the tunneling transport (for formal derivations, see Refs. [9,10]). To this aim we\nconsider the case of a narrow-band saturated Hubbard ferromagnet where the current\ncarriers are the holes in the lowest Hubbard band and the non-quasiparticle states provide all spectral weight for the minority spin projection [7]. A schematic density of\nstates is shown in Fig. 1a. Suppose we have a tunnel junction with two pieces of this\nferromagnet with either parallel (Fig. 1b) or antiparallel (Fig. 1c) magnetization directions. From the one-particle point of view, the spin-conserving tunneling is forbidden in\nthe latter case. However, in the framework of many-particle picture the charge current\nis a transfer process between an empty site and a single-occupied site rather than the\nmotion of the electron irrespective to the site like in the band theory and therefore the\ndistinction between these two cases (see Fig. 1), is due only to the difference in the densities of states. It means that the estimations of the tunneling magnetoresistance based\non simple one-electron picture is too optimistic; even for antiparallel spin orientation\nof two pieces of the half-metallic ferromagnets in the junction for zero temperature the\ncurrent is not zero, due to the non-quasiparticle states. More exactly, it vanishes for\nzero bias since the density of NQP states at the Fermi energy equals to zero. However,\nit grows with the bias sharply, having the scale of order of typical magnon energies,\nthat is, millivolts.\nThe latter statement is confirmed by a formal consideration of the antiparallel spin\norientation case, based on the standard tunneling Hamiltonian [15]:\nH = HL + HR +\n\nX\n\n(Tkp c\u2020k\u2191 cp\u2193 + h.c.)\n\n(1)\n\nkp\n\nwhere HL,R are the Hamiltonians of the left (right) half-spaces, k and p are corresponding quasimomenta and spin projections are defined with respect to the magnetization\ndirection of a given half-space with opposite magnetization directions (spin is supposed\nto be conserving in the \"global\" coordinate system). For the tunneling current I in the\nsecond order in Tkp one has\nI\u221d\n\nX\nkqp\n\n|Tkp |2 [1 + Nq \u2212 f (tp\u2212q )]\n\n\u00d7 [f (tk ) \u2212 f (tk + eV )] \u03b4(eV + tk \u2212 tp\u2212q + \u03c9q )\n\n(2)\n\nwhere e is the electron charge and V is the bias [9]. The differential conductance of\nthe junction with antiparallel magnetization directions is just proportional (for zero\ntemperature) to the density of the non-quasiparticle states,\ndI/dV \u221d NN QP (eV )\n3\n\n\fNote that the value NN QP (eV ) vanishes for |eV | < h\u0304\u03c90 , where h\u0304\u03c90 is an anisotropy\ngap in the magnon spectrum [9], which is small, but could be changed by suitable\nsubstitution [16]. It is worthwhile to note also that the nonquasiparticle states play an\nimportant role (together with the classical effect of the smearing of the gap by spindisorder scattering) in the depolarization of the states near the Fermi energy at finite\ntemperatures; again, estimations of the tunneling magnetoresistance based on a simple\nStoner-like picture of the energy spectrum appear to be completely unrealistic [17].\nIII. NON-QUASIPARTICLE STATES AND ELECTRONIC STRUCTURE\n\nTo perform the calculations we used the newly developed LDA+DMFT scheme\n[18]. This method is based on the so-called Exact Muffin-tin Orbitals (EMTO) scheme\n[19,20] within a screened KKR [21] approach, frozen core together with the local spin\ndensity approximation (LDA). The correlation effects are treated in the framework of\ndynamical mean field theory (DMFT) [22], with a spin-polarized T-matrix Fluctuation\nExchange (SPTF) type of DMFT solver [23]. The SPTF approximation is a multiband spin-polarized generalization of the fluctuation exchange approximation (FLEX)\n[12,13], but with a different treatment of particle-hole (PH) and particle-particle (PP)\nchannels. The particle-particle (PP) channel is described by a T -matrix approach [24]\ngiving a renormalization of the effective interaction. This effective interaction is used\nexplicitly in the particle-hole channel. Justifications, further developments and details\nof this scheme can be found in Ref. [23]. The spin-polaron process is described by the\n\u2032\nfluctuation potential matrix W \u03c3\u03c3 (i\u03c9) with \u03c3 = \u00b1, defined in a similar way as in the\nspin-polarized FLEX approximation [13]:\n\u0174 (i\u03c9) =\n\nW ++ (i\u03c9) W +\u2212 (i\u03c9)\nW \u2212+ (i\u03c9) W \u2212\u2212 (i\u03c9)\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(3)\n\nThe essential feature here is that the potential (3) is a complex energy dependent\nmatrix in spin pace with off-diagonal elements:\nW \u03c3,\u2212\u03c3 (i\u03c9) = U m (\u03c7\u03c3,\u2212\u03c3 (i\u03c9) \u2212 \u03c70\u03c3,\u2212\u03c3 (i\u03c9))U m\n\n(4)\n\nwhere U m represents the bare vertex matrix corresponding to the transverse magnetic\nchannel, \u03c7\u03c3,\u2212\u03c3 (i\u03c9) is an effective transverse susceptibility matrix and \u03c70\u03c3,\u2212\u03c3 (i\u03c9) is the\nbare transverse susceptibility [13]. i\u03c9 are fermionic Matsubara frequencies and (m) corresponds to the magnetic interaction channel [12,13]. The local Green functions as well\nas the electronic self-energies are spin diagonal for collinear magnetic configurations.\nIn this approximation the electronic self-energy is calculated in terms of the effective\ninteractions in various channels. The particle-particle contribution to the self-energy\nwas combined with the Hartree-Fock and the second order contributions [13]. To ensure a physical transparent description in the current implementation the combined\nparticle-particle selfenergy is presented by its a Hartree \u03a3(T H) and Fock \u03a3(T F ) types of\ncontributions:\n\u03a3 = \u03a3(T H) + \u03a3(T F ) + \u03a3(ph)\n4\n\n(5)\n\n\fwhere the particle-hole contribution \u03a3(ph) reads:\n(ph)\n\n\u03a312\u03c3 =\n\nX\n\n\u2032\n\n\u2032\n\n\u03c3\u03c3\nW1342\nG\u03c334\n\n(6)\n\n34\u03c3\u2032\n\nSince some part of the correlation effects are included already in the local spindensity approximation (LSDA) \"double counted\" terms should be taken into account.\nTo this aim, we start with the LSDA electronic structure and replace \u03a3\u03c3 (E) by \u03a3\u03c3 (E)\u2212\n\u03a3\u03c3 (0) in all equations of the LDA+DMFT method [25], the energy E being relative to\nthe Fermi energy and EF = 0. It means that we only add dynamical correlation effects\nto the LSDA method.\nIn our calculations we considered the standard representation of the zinc-blende\nstructure with an fcc unit cell containing four atoms: Cr(0, 0, 0), As(1/4, 1/4, 1/4) and\ntwo vacant sites E(1/2, 1/2, 1/2) and E1(3/4, 3/4, 3/4). We used the experimental lattice constant of GaAs(5.65\u00c5) and InAs(6.06\u00c5) for all the calculations, and the equilibrium value for the bulk CrAs (aeq = 5.8\u00c5), obtained by FLAPW [4]. To calculate the\ncharge density we integrate along a contour on the complex energy plane which extends\nfrom the bottom of the band up to the Fermi level [20], using 30 energy points. For the\nBrillouin zone integration we sum up a k-space grid of 89 points in the irreducible part\nof the Brillouin zone. A cutoff of lmax = 8 for the multi-pole expansion of the charge\ndensity and a cutoff of lmax = 3 for the wave functions was used. The Perdew-Wang\n[26] parameterization of the LDA to the exchange correlation potential was used.\nIV. RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS\n\nThe LDA+DMFT calculations were carried out for three lattice constants: the\nGaAs, InAs and the \"equilibrium\" one. The corresponding LDA computational results\nagree with previous ones [1,4,27]. In order to evaluate the average Coulomb interaction on the Cr atoms and the corresponding exchange interactions we start with the\nconstrained LDA method [28]. In our case the constrained LDA calculation indicates\nthat the average Coulomb interaction between the Cr 3d electrons is about U = 6.5 eV\nwith an exchange interaction energy about J = 0.9 eV. It is important to note that the\nvalues of the average Coulomb interaction parameter slightly decrease going from the\nGaAs (U = 6.59 eV) to InAs (U = 6.25 eV) lattice constants, see table Tab. I. This is\nin agreement with a naive picture of a less effective screening due to increasing of the\ndistances between the atoms.\nThe typical insulating screening used in the constraint calculation [28] should be\nreplaced by a metallic kind of screening. The metallic screening will lead to a smaller\nvalue of U. Unfortunately, there are no reliable schemes to calculate U in metals,\ntherefore we choose some intermediate value of U = 2 eV and J = 0.9 eV. It is\nimportant to realize that there are no significant changes in the values of the average\nCoulomb interaction for the studied lattice structures, and that the exchange interaction\nis practically constant. Note that physical results are not very sensitive to the value of\nU, as it was demonstrated by us for NiMnSb [14].\nThe LSDA and LSDA+DMFT calculation for the density of states, DOS, is presented in Fig. 2. Depending on the lattice constant the Cr and As atoms loose electrons\n5\n\n\fand this charge is gained by the vacant sites. As a result the Fermi level is moving from\nthe right edge of the gap as for the case of GaAs substrate, towards the middle of the\ngap for a InAs substrate. The Cr moments are well localized due to a mechanism being\nsimilar to that of localization of the magnetic moment on the Mn atom in the Heusler\nNiMnSb [29]. Note that the local Cr spin moment is more than 3\u03bcB , the As atom possesses a small induced magnetic moment (of order of \u22120.3\u03bcB ) coupled antiparallel to\nthe Cr one. The results are presented in table II. Calculated, DMFT, Cr magnetic moments increased in comparison with the LDA results, due to the localization tendency\nof the Cr\u22123d states as a consequence of correlation effects [18].\nAccording to our calculations, the system remains half-metallic with a pretty large\nband gap (about 1.8 eV) for all the lattice constants compared with the band gap of\nthe NiMnSb which is only 0.75 eV [29].\nIn Fig. 2 the non-quasiparticle states are visible for lattice parameter higher than\nthe equilibrium one, with a considerable spectral weight in the case of the InAs substrate. InAs is widely used as substrate material for the growth of different compounds.\nAccording to our calculations this situation is very favorable for the experimental investigation of the formation of non-quasiparticle states as well as the investigation of\ntheir nature.\nComparing with the case of the GaAs lattice parameter, for the InAs substrate, the\nmost significant change in the electronic structure is suffered by the As-p states. Having\na larger lattice constant the Cr atom acquires a slightly larger magnetic moment. In\nthe LDA calculations, nevertheless, the magnetic moment per unit cell is integer 3\u03bcB .\nExpanding the lattice constant from GaAs to InAs lattice the Cr states become more\natomic like and therefore the spin magnetic moment increases. This is reflected equally\nin the charge transfer which is smaller for the InAs lattice parameters. A larger Cr\nmoment induces a large spin polarization of the As-p states, compensating the smaller\np \u2212 d hybridization, the total moment remaining at its integer value of 3\u03bcB [27].\nNote that the essential difference of the many-body electronic structure for the\nlattice constants of GaAs and InAs is completely due to the difference in the position\nof the Fermi energy with respect to the minority-spin band gap whereas the self-energy\ncharacterizing the correlation effects is not changed too much (Fig. 3). The total\ndensity of states N (E) is rather sensitive to the difference between the band edge Ec\nand the Fermi energy EF . If this difference is very small (i.e., the system is close to\nthe electronic topological transition Ec \u2192 EF ) one can use a simple\nexpression for the\n\u221a\nsingular contribution to the bare density of states, \u03b4N0 (E) \u221d E \u2212 Ec (E > Ec ). The\nappearance of the complex self-energy \u03a3 (E) = \u03a31 (E) \u2212 i\u03a32 (E) changes the singular\ncontribution as\nq\n\n\u03b4N (E) \u221d [ Z12 (E) + \u03a322 (E) + Z1 (E)]1/2\n\n(7)\n\nwhere Z1 (E) = E \u2212 Ec \u2212 \u03a31 (E) (cf. Ref. [30]). Assuming that the self-energy is\nsmall in\u221acomparison with E \u2212 Ec one can find for the states in the gap \u03b4N (E) \u221d\n\u03a32 (E) / Ec \u2212 E (E < Ec ) . One can see that the shift of the gap edge changes drastically the density of states for the same \u03a32 (E) .\nIn the remaining part of the paper we elaborate more on the possibility of the\npractical use of tunable properties of non-quasiparticle states in CrAs grown on different\n6\n\n\fsubstrates. For most of the applications room-temperature and the stability of the\nferromagnetic state are the most important prerequisites. The ferromagnetic CrAs\nmaterial might be grown on III-V semiconductors similarly to the zinc-blende CrSb\n[33]. We observed the presence of the NQP states for CrAs lattice parameters larger\nthan 5.8\u00c5. It was found experimentally that at 300K, around this value of the lattice\nparameter a stable solid solution of Ga0.65 In0.35 As is formed [31]. So, from the practical\npoint of view a 65% of gallium in a Gax In1\u2212x As compound would constitute the ideal\nsubstrate on which the CrAs half-metal would present tunable properties of its NQPs.\nHaving the Ga0.65 In0.35 As substrate CrAs could be a part of the epitaxial III-V structure\nproviding an easy way to integrate with the existing semiconductor technology.\nIn addition, to determine possible substrates for growth of layered half-metallic materials, electronic structure calculations were carried out for lattice parameters in the\nrange 5.60\u00c5 to 6.03\u00c5 [32]. According to these calculations [32], growth with minimal\nstrain might be accomplished in a half-metallic multilayer system grown on InAs substrate which would be the best choice to evidence the NQP states, since the Fermi\nenergy is situated in this case far enough from the bottom of the conduction band.\nThe existence of NQP states is a manifestation of the many-body interaction at finite\ntemperatures, magnetoelectronic applications being able to measure their presence.\nA very high sensitivity of the minority-electron density of states near the Fermi\nenergy to the lattice constant opens a new interesting opportunity to run the current\nin CrAs-based tunnel junction. Suppose we have an antiparallel orientation of the\nmagnetizations in the tunnel junction (such as shown in Fig. 1c), then the I \u2212 V\ncharacteristic is determined by the density of the non-quasiparticle states. Thus if we\nwill influence the lattice constant (e.g., using a piezoelectric material) one can modify\nthe differential conductivity. This makes CrAs a very promising material with tunable\ncharacteristics which opens new ways for applications in spintronics.\nThis work is part of the research programme of the Stichting voor Fundamenteel\nOnderzoek der Materie (FOM), which is financially supported by the Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek (NWO).\n\n7\n\n\fREFERENCES\n[1] H.
