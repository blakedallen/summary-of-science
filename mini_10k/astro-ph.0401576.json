If supernovae\n(SN) had played a significant role in altering the thermal\nstatus of the ICM, then they should have left their imprint\nalso on its metal content (e.g., Renzini 2003). The increasing capability of X\u2013ray telescopes to perform spatially resolved spectroscopic studies of the ICM have opened in the\nlast years the possibility of quantifying the metal content of\nclusters. Observations from ASCA (e.g., Baumgartner et al.\n2003), Beppo\u2013SAX (e.g., De Grandi et al. 2003), Chandra\n(e.g., Ettori et al. 2002; Blanton et al. 2003) and XMM\u2013\nNewton (e.g., Gastaldello & Molendi 2002; Matsushita et\nal. 2003) have revealed that abundance gradients are quite\ncommon in clusters. Besides their distribution, the relative\nabundance of different metal species gives information on the\nrole played by type-Ia and II SN in the ICM enrichment (e.g.,\nc 2003 RAS\n\nMatteucci & Vettolani 1988; Pipino et al. 2002; Finoguenov\net al. 2002; Portinari et al. 2003). Finally, the lack of any\nsignificant evolution of the Fe abundance at least out to\nz \u223c 1 (Tozzi et al. 2003) demonstrates that the process of\nenrichment has been completed already at quite large lookback times. While the production of metals is connected to\nthe activity of star formation, their distribution may be determined by different physical effects, such as ram\u2013pressure\nstripping of metal-rich gas from merging galaxies or galactic winds powered by SN explosions and AGN activity (e.g.,\nGnedin 1998). Whatever the mechanism for metal transport\nand diffusion is, modelling the ICM enrichment requires a\ncareful description of the yields and of the lifetimes of the\ndifferent stellar populations associated to the different SN\ntypes (e.g., Matteucci 2001, and references therein). In this\nrespect N\u2013body simulations provide the ideal tool to describe in detail how metals are produced within galaxies and\ndistributed during the hierarchical assembly of a cluster. Besides semi\u2013analytical approaches (e.g. De Lucia, Kauffman\n\n\f2\n\nTornatore et al.\n\n& White 2003), attempts to include, within hydrodynamical simulations, star formation, SN energy feedback and\nmetal enrichment from type\u2013Ia and II SN, have been pursued by different authors (Aguirre et al. 2001; Lia, Portinari\n& Carraro 2002; Valdarnini 2002; Kawata & Gibson 2003;\nKobayashi 2003; Tissera & Scannapieco 2003). It is however\nclear that such approaches rely on the capability of the numerical codes to provide a physically sound description of\nthe relevant \"sub\u2013grid\" processes.\nIn this Letter we present the first results from our hydrodynamical simulations of clusters based on the implementation of chemical enrichment in the GADGET code (Springel,\nYoshida & White 2001). Our chemo-dynamical version of\nGADGET combines the rather advanced treatment of star\nformation and SN feedback, proposed by Springel & Hernquist (2003a, SH03 hereafter), to a careful description of\nthe role of type\u2013Ia and II SN in releasing metal\u2013enriched\ngas into the diffuse medium. In the following, when expressing the ICM metal abundances in solar units, we assume\nthe photospheric abundance provided by Grevesse & Sauval\n(1998).\n\n2\n\nTHE SIMULATION CODE\n\nOur simulations are based on an evolution of GADGET\u22c6\n(Springel et al. 2001), a parallel Tree+SPH code with fully\nadaptive time\u2013stepping. As a starting point, we used a version of GADGET, kindly provided by V. Springel, which includes an entropy\u2013conserving integration scheme, radiative\ncooling, the effect of a uniform and evolving UV background\n(Haardt & Madau 1999), star formation from a multiphase\ninterstellar medium and a prescription for galactic winds\ntriggered by SN explosions (see SH03 for a detailed description). In the original version of the code, the energy release\nand a global metallicity was produced only by SNII under\nthe instantanous\u2013recycling approximation (IRA).\nThe GADGET code has been suitably modified, so as\nto correctly include the life\u2013times of different stellar populations, to follow metal production from both SNIa and\nII, while self\u2013consistently introducing the dependence of the\ncooling function on metallicity. A detailed description of the\nimplementation of these algorithms will be presented in a\nforthcoming paper (Tornatore et al. 2004, in preparation),\nwhile we provide here a short descriptions of the most relevant features of the code.\nIn order to maintain the general approach of the multiphase model by SH03, we still treat under the IRA stars\nwith masses > 20 M\u2299 , while accounting for the different lifetimes of stars of smaller mass (Matteucci & Padovani 1993).\nWithin the stochastic approach to star formation (SH03),\neach star particle is considered as a single stellar population (SSP). For each SSP we compute the number of stars\nturning into SNII and Ia at each time-step after its creation.\nThe SNIa are associated to binary systems whose components are in the 0.8\u20138 M\u2299 mass range (Greggio & Renzini\n1983), while SNII arise from stars with mass > 8 M\u2299 (cf.\nalso Lia et al. 2002, who adopt the lower mass threshold\nof 6M\u2299 for SNII). Besides SNe, which release energy and\n\u22c6 http://www.MPA-Garching.MPG.DE/gadget/\n\nmetals, we also account for planetary nebulae (PN). They\ncontribute to metal production, but not to the energy feedback, and are identified with those stars, not turning into\nSNIa, in the mass range 0.8\u20138 M\u2299 . We use the analytical\nfitting formulas for stellar yields of SNIa, SNII and PNe as\nprovided by Recchi et al. (2001), and based on the original\nnucleosynthesis computations of Nomoto et al. (1997, using\ntheir W7 model), Woosley & Weaver (1995) and Renzini &\nVoli (1981). The formulation for the SNIa rate has been calculated as in Matteucci & Recchi (2001). Besides H and He,\nthe current version of the code follows the production of Fe,\nO, C, Si, Mg, S, and can be easily modified to include other\nmetal species. Once produced by a star particle, metals are\nspread over the same number of neighbours, 32, used for\nthe SPH implementation, also using the same kernel. In this\nway, we find that 90 per cent of the metals are distributed\nwithin a gas mass of 5.4 \u00d7 109 h\u22121 M\u2299 . We have verified that\nusing a twice as large number of neighbors to spread metals\nresults in a twice as large gas mass for metal mixing, while\nfinal results on the amount and distribution of metals (see\nbelow) are left almost unchanged. As for the energy release,\neach SN is assumed to produce 1051 ergs. Instead of assuming any specific value for the thermalization efficiency of the\nenergy released by SN, we prefer to dump all the energy to\nthe surrounding gas particles and leave to the simulation\nthe computation of the radiation losses. Since the physical processes determining the actual SN efficiency are below\nthe resolution scale of our simulations, the rationale behind\nour choice is to leave to the sub\u2013grid multiphase model by\nSH03 establishing how much of this energy enters in regulating the star formation process. We normalize the IMFs\nin the mass range 0.1\u2013100 M\u2299 . Owing to the uncertainty in\nmodelling yields for very massive stars, we take yields to be\nindependent of mass above 40 M\u2299 . While any uncertainty in\nthe yields of such massive stars has a negligible effect for a\nSalpeter IMF (Salpeter 1955, S55 hereafter), their accurate\ndescription (e.g. Thielemann et al. 1996; Heger & Woosley\n2002) is required when using a top\u2013heavier IMF. We note\nthat our scheme to distribute metals in the ICM does not\ninclude the effect of diffusion. Lia et al. (2002) included the\neffect of diffusion driven by SN blast waves (see Thornton\net al. 1998) in their SPH simulations with chemical enrichment. Although this effect is quite important to describe the\ndiffusion of metals within the interstellar medium, it is likely\nto play a minor role on scales above the typical resolution\nscale, \u223c 10 h\u22121 kpc, of the cluster simulations that we are\ndiscussing here.\nOur prescription to account for stellar evolution in the\nsimulations implies a substantial change of the multiphase\n\"effective model\" by SH03. In this model, gas particles are\nassumed to have a cold neutral and a hot ionized phase in\npressure equilibrium, the former providing the reservoir for\nstar formation. We have modified the criterion, dependent\non local density and temperature, to establish the relative\namount of such two phases, so as to account for the gradual\nSN energy release, which modifies the temperature of the\nhot phase and the evaporation of the cold one. This means\nto include new energy terms in Eq.(10) of SH03, which describes the evolution of the internal energy of the hot\u2013phase\ncomponent, while making the cooling function dependent on\nlocal metallicity.

A first one\ngives the rate of gas ejection by winds, according to the\nrelation, \u1e40W = \u03b7 \u1e40\u2217 , where \u1e40\u2217 is the star formation rate.\nThe second one, determines the fraction of SN energy that\n2\npowers the winds, 21 \u1e40W vW\n= \u03c7\u01ebSN \u1e40\u2217 , where \u01ebSN is the\nenergy feedback provided by the SN under IRA assumption\nfor each M\u2299 of stars formed. In our implementation of the\nwinds, we also account for the energy contributed from all\nthe SN treated without the IRA, namely SNII in the 8\u2013\n20M\u2299 mass range and SNIa.\nIt is worth noticing that the star formation and SN\nfeedback scheme, originally introduced by SH03, has been\nalready demonstrated to provide the correct fraction of\nbaryons locked in stars, the correct cosmic star formation\nhistory (Springel & Hernquist 2003b), the correct amount of\nneutral hydrogen in high column\u2013density absorbing systems\nat high redshift (Nagamine et al. 2003), and to reproduce\nc 2003 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\nthe basic X\u2013ray scaling properties of galaxy clusters (Borgani et al. 2003). As such, it represents a good starting point\nfor a simulation study of the ICM chemical enrichment.\n\n3\n\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nWe use our chemodynamical version of GADGET to run\nsimulations of the Virgo\u2013like cluster, which has been described by Tornatore et al. (2003). This structure is a fairly\nrelaxed halo with a virial mass of 3.9\u00d71014 M\u2299 and emission\u2013\nweighted temperature of about 3 keV. It has been selected\nfrom a cosmological DM-only simulation of a flat \u039bCDM\nmodel, with \u03a9m = 0.3, \u03a9bar = 0.04, h = 0.7 and \u03c38 = 0.8,\nwithin a box of 100 Mpc a side. Mass and force resolutions\nare increased in the Lagrangian region surrounding the cluster, so that mDM = 2.1 \u00d7 109 M\u2299 and mgas = 3.2 \u00d7 108 M\u2299\nfor the mass of the DM and gas particles, respectively. The\nPlummer\u2013equivalent gravitational softening is \u01eb = 5 h\u22121 kpc\nfixed in physical units from z = 0 to z = 2, while fixed in\ncomoving units at earlier epochs.\nIn this Letter we focus on the effect of changing the\n\n\f4\n\nTornatore et al.\n\nmain ingredients which determine the content and distribution of metals in the ICM, namely the IMF and the feedback strength. The choice of such parameters for the different simulations, along with some results, are summarized\nin Table 1. Besides the standard IMF Salpeter shape (S55),\ndN/d log m \u221d m\u2212x , with x = 1.35, we also consider the flatter IMF by Arimoto & Yoshii (1987, AY hereafter), with x =\n0.95, which provides a larger number of massive stars. Different authors (e.g., Finoguenov et al. 2003, FBB hereafter;\nBaumgartner et al. 2003, B03 hereafter) have suggested that\nan early population of very massive, metal poor stars should\nbe advocated to account for the pattern of ICM abundances\n(cf. also Scannapieco, Schneider & Ferrara 2002). Therefore,\nwe also consider an evolving IMF with the shape proposed\nby Larson (1999), dN/d log m \u221d (1 + m/ms )\u22121.35 . Following\nFBB, we allow log ms /M\u2299 to linearly increase with redshift\nfrom \u22120.35 at z = 2 up to 1 at z = 10, being constant at\nz < 2.\nAs a first diagnostic for the ICM metal enrichment, we\nuse the profiles of Fe abundance. We compare in Figure 1\nthe results of our simulations to those from the Beppo\u2013SAX\nobservations of 12 cool\u2013core clusters by De Grandi et al.\n(2003). In the left panels of Figure 1 we show the effect of\nchanging the strength of the feedback for the Salpeter IMF.\nModel A has a wind speed of vW = 520km s\u22121 . Model B\nassumes somewhat weaker winds, while Model C assumes\nthat the energy in winds is three times higher than that\nprovided by SN, with the same wind velocity as in Model\nA once a three times larger amount of gas (i.e., \u03b7 = 6) is\nejected. As long as we assume that AGN activity in galaxies follows star formation (e.g., Boyle & Terlevich 1997, cf.\nalso Cristiani et al. 2003), such an extra energy powering\nthe winds can be interpreted as released by nuclear activity. All the models produce ZFe profiles (we define ZFe as\nthe iron abundance by mass in solar unit, XFe /XFe\u2299 ) which\nare steeper than observed at R <\n\u223c 0.05R200 . At larger radii\nsimulated profiles for Models A and B have a shape similar\nto the observed ones, although lower by about a factor two.\nAn inspection of the age of stars associated with the central\ncD reveals that they are younger than those observed in real\nclusters, with signatures of significant ongoing star formation down to z = 0. This is also consistent with the large\namount of stars found in the simulated cluster (see Col. 6\nof Table 1), witnessing that feedback is not strong enough\nto inhibit recent star formation. The steep profiles of Fe\nabundance suggest that a significant amount of Fe in central\nregions has been produced quite recently, within an already\nformed cluster potential well, thus making difficult for winds\nto transport metals far from the star forming regions. This\nfact further confirms that a mechanism is currently missing\nin simulations to diffuse metals and quench star formation\nbefore most of the mass is accreted in the cluster potential\nwell. By increasing the wind efficiency, as in Model C, star\nformation is heavely suppressed at high redshift. While this\nturns into a more acceptable value of f\u2217 , it has the unwelcome feature of a too low ICM metallicity, with a quite steep\ngradient.\nUsing for Model D the AY IMF, with the same choice of\nfeedback parameters as in Model A, provides a much larger\nenergy release from massive stars. Correspondingly, the wind\nvelocity is about twice as large and, probably, unrealistic.\nThe resulting star fraction is acceptable, but with a larger\n\nFigure 2.

(2003) from\ntheir compilation of ASCA data (circles with errorbars), and those\nmeasured for the different runs of our Virgo\u2013like clusters. Model\nlabels are the same as in Table 1. The filled data point refers to\nthe temperature bin appropriate for our simulated cluster.\n\namount of Fe released into the ICM, as a consequence of the\nhigher IMF over most of the mass range relevant for SNIa.\nReducing the \u03c7 parameter in Model E, to obtain wind velocity comparable to Model A, increases the resulting star\nfraction and the total amount of produced Fe (see Table 1).\nHowever, the weaker winds cause a large Fe fraction to remain in star\u2013forming regions, being locked into stars instead\nof being diffused. Having a top\u2013heavier IMF at high redshift\n(Model F) has again the effect of increasing the feedback efficiency. As for the Fe production and diffusion, its behaviour\nis similar to that of Model D, thought with \u223c 30 per cent\nmore Fe due to the higher IMF over the mass range relevant\nfor SNIa.\nIn the upper panels of Fig.1 we show the profiles of\n[O/Fe]. Since Oxygen is mostly produced by SNII, [O/Fe] is\nusually considered as a diagnostic for the relative role played\nby the two SN types. So far, robust measurements of the O\nabundance have been realized with the XMM-NEWTON\nGRS, and are limited to the very central regions of galaxy\nclusters. Gastaldello & Molendi (2002) and Matsushita et\nal. (2003) found [O/Fe]\u2243 \u22120.3 around M87 out to about\n60 kpc, which corresponds to \u2243 0.04 R200 for our simulated\ncluster. On larger scales, the difficult detection of the OVIII\nemission line at 0.67 keV makes the determination of [O/Fe]\nmore uncertain, although values in the range between \u22120.2\nand 0.2 seem to be preferred (see Renzini 1997 for a discussion). The negative gradients of our [O/Fe] profiles are the\nsignature of recent star formation episodes in the central region. This arises because SNII already had time to explode,\nwhile SNIa, which are generated by longer\u2013living stars, still\nhave to release Iron. As a consequence, the ICM for Models A and B turns out to be over\u2013abundant in Oxygen, in\nthe central regions, with respect to what observed for M87,\nwhile being consistent with data on larger scales. Assuming\nc 2003 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fSimulating the metal enrichment of the ICM\nan AY IMF provides a relatively larger number of SNII, thus\nexacerbating the problem of Oxygen overabundance.\nAs for the overall metallicity, we obtain emission\u2013\nweighted ZFe values in the range 0.25\u20130.55, with the only\nexception of Model C, which produces a lower Fe abundance. It is worth noticing that, although Models A and F\new\nproduces the highest ZFe\nvalues (see Table 1), they have different mass\u2013weighted Fe abundances. In particular, the high\new\nZFe\nof Model A corresponds to a fairly small mass\u2013weighted\nvalue, the large difference being due to the steep profile of\nthe Fe abundance. In their compilation of ASCA data, B03\nfind that ZFe tends to decrease with cluster temperature,\nwith ZFe \u2243 0.7 for T \u2243 3 keV, down to ZFe \u2243 0.3 at T \u2243 10\nkeV (cf. also Renzini 2003, who claims a roughly constant\nZFe \u223c 0.3 over the same temperature range). Therefore,\nfor our Virgo\u2013like cluster we should expect a Fe enrichment\nwhich is sensibly larger than found in simulations. However,\nwe note that the procedure of stacking X\u2013ray spectra of\nclusters with similar temperature, as followed by B03, corresponds to assuming that all clusters having the same T\nalso have the same metallicity, and, therefore, that the fairly\nlarge scatter observed is only due to measurement errors.\nSince some amount of intrinsic scatter is anyway expected,\nit is difficult to assess, with only one cluster simulated, how\ndiscrepant are our ZFe values with respect to the observed\nones. Another feature of the simulated Fe production is that\nthe ICM contains between about 25 and 40 per cent of the\ntotal amount of produced Fe, at odds with observational indications for MFe,ICM /MFe,\u2217 \u223c 2 (Renzini 2003). This further suggests that a mechanism is still lacking in simulations\nto transport metals away from star\u2013forming regions.\nUnlike Oxygen, which is difficult to detect in the X\u2013\nray spectra of the hot ICM, Silicon is now detected for a fair\nnumber of clusters. Since a sizeable fraction of Si is produced\nalso by SNIa, depending on the choice for the IMF, it could\nbe a useful tool to investigate the relative contribution to\nmetal enrichment from the two SNe types (e.g. Lowenstein\n2003). In Figure 2 we show [Si/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] for our simulations, compared to the observational values from B03.\nSeveral of our runs produce a relative [Si/Fe] ratio which\nfalls on the correlation indicated by data, although the observed absolute Fe abundance for \u2243 3 keV clusters (marked\nby the filled circle) is significantly larger than that produced\nby several of our models. We note that the models better approximating observational data are A and F, which, besides\nproviding a realistic emission\u2013weighted Fe abundance, also\nproduce an acceptable amount of Si.\nAs a word of caution, we note that the resolution of the\nsimulations presented here could prevent the treatment of\nsome physical effects, which may change final results. For instance, effects of dynamical stripping may play a significant\nrole in removing metal\u2013rich gas from cluster galaxies and,\ntherefore, to enrich the diffuse ICM (e.g., Gnedin 1998; Toniazzo & Schindler 2001). While tidal stripping should be well\nrepresented in our simulations, a proper treatment of ram\u2013\npressure stripping would require a substantially higher resolution in an SPH simulation. Aguirre et al. (2001) claim that\nram\u2013pressure stripping from galaxies of mass > 3 \u00d7 1010 M\u2299\naccounts for a small fraction of the ICM metal content. Furthermore, Renzini (2003) argues that, if ram\u2013pressure stripping were efficient, then clusters with larger velocity disc 2003 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n5\n\npersion should have a relatively higher metallicity, a trend\nwhich is not observed.\nFurthermore, in order to have reliable estimates of the\nICM metal enrichment, we have to make sure that our simulation has high enough resolution to provide a correct representation of the star formation history (see also Tornatore et\nal. 2003). We postpone a detailed study of numerical convergence of star formation and metal production within clusters\nin a forthcoming paper.\n\n4\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe have presented results from hydrodynamical simulations\nof the ICM, realized with a chemodynamical version of the\nGADGET code. We used a version of this code that, besides\na fairly advanced treatment of star formation and feedback\nfrom galactic winds (Springel & Hernquist 2003a, SH03),\nalso correctly accounts for life\u2013times of different stellar populations, as well as for metal and energy release from SNIa\nand II (Tornatore et al. 2004, in preparation). By simulating\none single cluster, having temperature of about 3 keV, we\nlooked at the effect of feedback strength and IMF on the\nresulting metal production. Our main results can be summarized as follows.\n(a) Among the considered models, using a variable IMF\n(Model F) provides an acceptable amount of Fe mass, as\nwell as [Si/Fe] and [O/Fe] ratios, in fair agreement with observations. Using a Salpeter (1955) IMF turns into a lower\namount of Fe mass and to supersolar values of [O/Fe] in\nthe central cluster region, at variance with observations. An\nArimoto\u2013Yoshii (1987) IMF provides an even larger Oxygen\nabundance, as a consequence of the larger number of SNII.\n(b) Gradients of the Fe abundance are always steeper than\nobserved in central cluster regions, R<\n\u223c 0.1R200 , while the\nZFe profiles on larger scales fall below the observed ones, by\nan amount which depends on the feedback strength and on\nthe assumed IMF.\n(c) Besides the effect of the IMF, the oversolar value of the\n[O/Fe] ratio found in central regions for several models could\nbe due to the presence of a significant recent star formation\nin central cluster regions. Because of such an excess of recent\nstar formation, not shown by observational data, the stars\nin our simulations lock a large fraction of metals (see Table\n1).\nOur analysis confirms that the observed pattern of\nmetal enrichment of the ICM is deeply connected to the\npast history of star formation in clusters and to the feedback scheme that should release energy and heavy elements\ninto the diffuse medium. The fairly steep gradients of the Fe\nabundance and the signature of recent star formation consistently indicate that our simulations are missing a feedback mechanism, which should quench star formation and\nspread metals at an early enough epoch, when the proto\u2013\ncluster potential well is still shallow enough not to retain\nthe produced heavy elements. We verified that this feedback\ncannot be easily implemented by resorting to SNII and Ia.\nNeither increasing the strength of the feedback nor changing the IMF helps in restoring a better agreement with the\nobserved profile of the Fe abundance. In our opinion this is\na non\u2013trivial result, since it has been obtained in the frame-\n\n\f6\n\nTornatore et al.\n\nwork a rather advanced scheme for star formation and SN\nfeedback (SH03), which is otherwise quite successful at accounting for the pattern of cosmic star formation (Springel\n& Herquist 2003b). In turn, this suggests that other energy\nsources, such as AGN, should be called into play to regulate\nthe cooling structure of the ICM and determine its chemical\ncomposition.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS.\nWe are greatly indebted to Volker Springel for having\nprovided us with the non\u2013public version of GADGET,\nand for his continuous advices on the code whereabouts.\nWe acknowledge useful discussions with Francesco Calura,\nCristina Chiappini, Sabrina De Grandi, Alexis Finoguenov\nand Laura Portinari.
