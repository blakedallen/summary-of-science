Dating to 1788, it can be taken as the starting point for\nthe theory of automatic control (see MacFarlane [10] and references therein).\nIn this paper the system coupling the Watt-centrifugal-governor and the\nsteam-engine will be called simply the Watt Governor System (WGS). See\nSection 2 for a description and illustration, in Fig. 1, of this system.\nLandmarks for the study of the local stability analysis of the WGS are\nthe works of Maxwell [11] and Vyshnegradskii [16]. A simplified version of\nthe WGS local stability based on the work of Vyshnegradskii is presented by\nPontryagin [13]. A local stability study generalized to a more general Watt\ngovernor design was carried out by Denny [4] and pursued by the authors in\n[14].\nEnlightening historical comments about the Watt governor local mathematical stability and oscillatory analysis can be found in MacFarlane [10]\nand Denny [4]. There, as well as in [13], we learn that toward the mid XIX\ncentury, improvements in the engineering design led to less reliable operations in the WGS, leading to fluctuations and oscillations instead of the ideal\nstable constant speed output requirement. The first mathematical analysis of\nthe stability conditions and subsequent indication of the modification in the\ndesign to avoid the problem was carried out by Maxwell [11] and, in a user\nfriendly style likely to be better understood by engineers, by Vyshnegradskii\n[16].\nFrom the mathematical point of view, the oscillatory, small amplitude,\nbehavior in the WGS can be associated to a periodic orbit that appears from\na Hopf bifurcation. This was established by Hassard et al. in [5] and AlHumadi and Kazarinoff in [1]. Another procedure, based in the method of\n2\n\n\fharmonic balance, has been suggested by Denny [4] to detect large amplitude\noscillations.\nIn [14] we characterized the surface of Hopf bifurcations in a WGS, which\nis more general than that presented by Pontryagin [13], Al-Humadi and\nKazarinoff [1] and Denny [4]. See Theorem 4.1 and Fig. 3 for a review of the\ncritical curve on the surface where the first Lyapunov coefficient vanishes.\nIn the present paper, restricting ourselves to Pontryagin's system, we go\ndeeper investigating the stability of the equilibrium along the above mentioned critical curve. To this end the second Lyapunov coefficient is calculated (Theorem 4.4) and it is established that it vanishes at a unique point\n(see Fig. 4 and 5). The third Lyapunov coefficient is calculated at this point\n(Theorem 4.5) and found to be positive. The pertinent bifurcation diagrams\nare established. See Fig. 6, 7 and 9. A conclusion derived from these diagrams, concerning the region -a solid \"tongue\"- in the space of parameters\nwhere an attracting periodic orbit coexists with an attracting equilibrium, is\nspecifically commented in Section 5.\nThe extensive calculations involved in Theorems 4.4 and 4.5 have been\ncorroborated with the software MATHEMATICA 5 [18] and the main steps\nhave been posted in the site [17].\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we introduce the WGS\nand review the Pontryagin differential equations [13]. The stability of the\nequilibrium points is also analyzed. This section is essentially a review of\n[13, 5, 1, 14]. The Hopf bifurcations in the WGS differential equations are\nstudied in Sections 3 and 4. Expressions for the second and third Lyapunov\ncoefficients, which fully clarify their sign, are obtained, pushing forward the\nmethod found in the works of Kuznetsov [8, 9]. With this data, the bifurcation diagrams are established. Concluding comments, synthesizing and\n\n3\n\n\finterpreting the results achieved here, are presented in Section 5.\n\n2\n\nThe Watt centrifugal governor system\n\n2.1\n\nDifferential equations for the Watt governor system\n\nAccording to Pontryagin [13], p. 217, the differential equations of the WGS\nillustrated in Fig. 1 are\nd\u03c6\nd\u03c4\nd\u03c8\nd\u03c4\nd\u03a9\nd\u03c4\n\u0001\nwhere \u03c6 \u2208 0, \u03c02 is\n\n= \u03c8\n= c2 \u03a92 sin \u03c6 cos \u03c6 \u2212\n=\n\ng\nb\nsin \u03c6 \u2212\n\u03c8\nl\nm\n\n(1)\n\n1\n(\u03bc cos \u03c6 \u2212 F )\nI\n\nthe angle of deviation of the arms of the centrifugal\n\ngovernor from its vertical axis S1 , \u03a9 \u2208 [0, \u221e) is the angular velocity of the\n\nrotation of the flywheel D, \u03b8 is the angular velocity of S1 , l is the length\n\nof the arms, m is the mass of each ball, H is a sleeve which supports the\narms and slides along S1 , T is a set of transmission gears, V is the valve that\ndetermines the supply of steam to the engine, \u03c4 is the time, \u03c8 = d\u03c6/d\u03c4 , g is\nthe standard acceleration of gravity, \u03b8 = c \u03a9, c > 0 is a constant transmission\nratio, b > 0 is a constant of the frictional force of the system, I is the moment\nof inertia of the flywheel, F is an equivalent torque of the load and \u03bc > 0 is\na proportionality constant. The reader is referred to Pontryagin [13] for the\nderivation of (1) from Newton's Second Law of Motion.\nAfter the following change in the coordinates and time\ns\ns\ns\nl\nl\nl\n\u03c8, z = c\n\u03a9, \u03c4 =\nt,\nx = \u03c6, y =\ng\ng\ng\n4\n\n(2)\n\n\fFigure 1: Watt-centrifugal-governor-steam-engine system.\nthe differential equations (1) can be written as\ndx\n= y\ndt\ndy\n= z 2 sin x cos x \u2212 sin x \u2212 \u03b5 y\ny\u2032 =\ndt\ndz\n= \u03b1 (cos x \u2212 \u03b2)\nz\u2032 =\ndt\n\nx\u2032 =\n\nwhere \u03b1 > 0, 0 < \u03b2 < 1 and \u03b5 > 0, given by\ns\nb\nl\ncl\u03bc\nF\n\u03b5=\n, \u03b1=\n, \u03b2= ,\nm g\ngI\n\u03bc\n\n(3)\n\n(4)\n\nare the normalized variable parameters.

If 0 < \u03b5 < 2 \u03b1 \u03b2 3/2 then P0 is unstable.\n6\n\n\fThe proof of this theorem can essentially be found in Pontryagin [13]; it\nhas also been established in a more general setting in [14].\nThe surface of critical parameters \u03bc0 = (\u03b2, \u03b1, \u03b5c) such that \u03b5c = \u03b5(\u03b2, \u03b1) =\n2 \u03b1 \u03b2 3/2 is illustrated in Fig. 2. In the Section 4 we will analyze the stability\nof P0 as \u03b5c = 2 \u03b1 \u03b2 3/2 . The change in the stability at the equilibrium P0 as\nthe parameters cross the critical surface produces a Hopf bifurcation in the\nWGS, whose analysis has been carried out by [1], [5] and, in a more general\nsetting, by [14].\nFrom (4), \u03b5 represents the friction coefficient of the system. The case\n\u03b5 = 0 maybe of theoretical interest due to its connection with conservative\nsystems. However, as made explicit in Vyshnegradskii's Rules, friction is\nan essential ingredient to attain stability. This point is neatly presented in\nPontryagin [13], of which Figure 2 is a geometric, dimensionless, synthesis.\n\n3\n\nLyapunov coefficients\n\nThe beginning of this section is a review of the method found in [8], pp\n177-181, and in [9] for the calculation of the first and second Lyapunov coefficients.

Since hp, qi = 1 and\n\nhp, (i\u03c90 In \u2212 A)vi = 0 it follows that s = 0. Substituting s = 0 into the first\nequation of (30) one has (i\u03c90 In \u2212 A)v = 0.

Therefore (v, s) = (0, 0).\n\nLet (v, s) be a solution of (29).

Therefore hp, (i\u03c90In \u2212 A)vi = 0. Taking the inner product of p\n\nwith the first equation of (32) one has hp, (i\u03c90 In \u2212 A)v + sqi = hp, ai, which\n\ncan be written as\n\nhp, (i\u03c90 In \u2212 A)vi + shp, qi = hp, ai.\nAs hp, ai = 0, hp, qi = 1 and hp, (i\u03c90 In \u2212 A)vi = 0 it follows that s = 0.\n\nSubstituting s = 0 into the first equation of (32) results (i\u03c90 In \u2212 A)v = a.\n\nTherefore v is a

and algorithmic procedures to write\nthe expressions for the Lyapunov coefficients lj , j = 1, 2, 3, for two dimensional systems can be found in Andronov et al. [2] and Gasull et al. [6],\namong others. These procedures apply also to the three dimensional systems\nof this work, if properly restricted to the center manifold. The authors found,\nhowever, that the method outlined above, due to Kuznetsov [8, 9], requiring\nno explicit formal evaluation of the center manifold, is better adapted to the\nneeds of this work.\nA Hopf point (x0 , \u03bc0 ) is an equilibrium point of (11) where the Jacobian\nmatrix A = fx (x0 , \u03bc0 ) has a pair of purely imaginary eigenvalues \u03bb2,3 =\n\u00b1i\u03c90 , \u03c90 > 0, and admits no other critical eigenvalues -i.e. located on the\n\nimaginary axis. At a Hopf point a two dimensional center manifold is welldefined, it is invariant under the flow generated by (11) and can be continued\n\nwith arbitrary high class of differentiability to nearby parameter values. In\nfact, what is well defined is the \u221e-jet -or infinite Taylor series- of the\ncenter manifold, as well as that of its continuation, any two of them having\ncontact in the arbitrary high order of their differentiability class.\nA Hopf point is called transversal if the parameter dependent complex\neigenvalues cross the imaginary axis with non-zero derivative. In a neighborhood of a transversal Hopf point -H1 point, for concision- with l1 6= 0 the\n\ndynamic behavior of the system (11), reduced to the family of parameterdependent continuations of the center manifold, is orbitally topologically\nequivalent to the following complex normal form\nw \u2032 = (\u03b7 + i\u03c9)w + l1 w|w|2,\nw \u2208 C, \u03b7, \u03c9 and l1 are real functions having derivatives of arbitrary high\n\norder, which are continuations of 0, \u03c90 and the first Lyapunov coefficient at\n16\n\n\fthe H1 point. See [8]. As l1 < 0 (l1 > 0) one family of stable (unstable)\nperiodic orbits can be found on this family of manifolds, shrinking to an\nequilibrium point at the H1 point.\nA Hopf point of codimension 2 is a Hopf point where l1 vanishes. It is\ncalled transversal if \u03b7 = 0 and l1 = 0 have transversal intersections, where\n\u03b7 = \u03b7(\u03bc) is the real part of the critical eigenvalues. In a neighborhood\nof a transversal Hopf point of codimension 2 -H2 point, for concision-\nwith l2 6= 0 the dynamic behavior of the system (11), reduced to the family\nof parameter-dependent continuations of the center manifold, is orbitally\ntopologically equivalent to\nw \u2032 = (\u03b7 + i\u03c90 )w + \u03c4 w|w|2 + l2 w|w|4,\nwhere \u03b7 and \u03c4 are unfolding parameters. See [8]. The bifurcation diagrams\nfor l2 6= 0 can be found in [8], p. 313, and in [15].\n\nA Hopf point of codimension 3 is a Hopf point of codimension 2 where l2\n\nvanishes. A Hopf point of codimension 3 is called transversal if \u03b7 = 0, l1 = 0\nand l2 = 0 have transversal intersections. In a neighborhood of a transversal\nHopf point of codimension 3 -H3 point, for concision- with l3 6= 0 the\n\ndynamic behavior of the system (11), reduced to the family of parameterdependent continuations of the center manifold, is orbitally topologically\nequivalent to\nw \u2032 = (\u03b7 + i\u03c90 )w + \u03c4 w|w|2 + \u03bdw|w|4 + l3 w|w|6,\nwhere \u03b7, \u03c4 and \u03bd are unfolding parameters. The bifurcation diagram for\nl3 6= 0 can be found in Takens [15].\nTheorem 3.3 Suppose that the system\nx\u2032 = f (x, \u03bc), x = (x, y, z), \u03bc = (\u03b2, \u03b1, \u03b5)\n17\n\n\fhas the equilibrium x = 0 for \u03bc = 0 with eigenvalues\n\u03bb2,3 (\u03bc) = \u03b7(\u03bc) \u00b1 i\u03c9(\u03bc),\nwhere \u03c9(0) = \u03c90 > 0. For \u03bc = 0 the following conditions hold\n\u03b7(0) = 0, l1 (0) = 0, l2 (0) = 0,\nwhere l1 (\u03bc) and l2 (\u03bc) are the first and second Lyapunov coefficients, respectively. Assume that the following genericity conditions are satisfied\n1. l3 (0) 6= 0, where l3 (0) is the third Lyapunov coefficient;\n2. the map \u03bc \u2192 (\u03b7(\u03bc), l1 (\u03bc), l2 (\u03bc)) is regular at \u03bc = 0.\nThen, by the introduction of a complex variable, the above system reduced to\nthe family of parameter-dependent continuations of the center manifold, is\norbitally topologically equivalent to\nw \u2032 = (\u03b7 + i\u03c90 )w + \u03c4 w|w|2 + \u03bdw|w|4 + l3 w|w|6\nwhere \u03b7, \u03c4 and \u03bd are unfolding parameters.\nRemark 3.4 The proof of this theorem given by Takens for C \u221e families of\nvector fields, using the Malgrange-Mather Preparation Theorem [7], is also\nvalid in the present case of arbitrarily high, but finite, class of differentiability,\nusing the appropriate extensions of the Preparation Theorem.

See also [10, 14].\nThis paper starts reviewing the stability analysis due to Maxwell and\nVyshnegradskii, which accounts for the characterization, in the space of parameters, of the structural as well as Lyapunov stability of the equilibrium\nof the Watt Centrifugal Governor System, WGS. It continues with recounting the extension of the analysis to the first order, codimension one stable\n30\n\n\fFigure 9: Bifurcation diagram of the system (3) at point R1 .\npoints, happening on the complement of a curve in the critical surface where\nthe eigenvalue criterium of Lyapunov holds, as studied in [5], [1] and by the\nauthors [14], based on the calculation of the first Lyapunov coefficient. Here\nthe bifurcation analysis at the equilibrium point of the WGS is pushed forward to the calculation of the second and third Lyapunov coefficients which\nmake possible the determination of the Lyapunov as well as higher order\nstructural stability at the equilibrium point. See also [8, 9], [6] and [2] .\nThe calculations of these coefficients, being extensive, rely on Computer\nAlgebra and Numerical evaluations carried out with the software MATHEMATICA 5 [18]. In the site [17] have been posted the main steps of the\ncalculations in the form of notebooks for MATHEMATICA 5.\nWith the analytic and numeric data provided in the analysis performed\nhere, the bifurcation diagrams are established along the points of the curve\n31\n\n\fwhere the first Lyapunov coefficient vanishes. Picture 8 and 9 provide a\nqualitative synthesis of the dynamical conclusions achieved here at the parameter values where the WGS achieves most complex equilibrium point. A\nreformulation of these conclusions follow:\nThere is a \"solid tongue\" where two stable regimes coexist: one is an\nequilibrium and the other is a small amplitude periodic orbit, i.e. an oscillation.\nFor parameters inside the \"tongue\", this conclusion suggests, a hysteresis\nexplanation for the phenomenon of \"hunting\" observed in the performance\nof WGS in an early stage of the research on its stability conditions. Which\nattractor represents the actual state of the system will depend on the path\nalong which the parameters evolve to reach their actual values of the parameters under consideration. See Denny [4] for historical comments, where he\nrefers to the term \"hunting\" to mean an oscillation around an equilibrium\ngoing near but not reaching it.\nFinally, we would like to stress that although this work ultimately focuses the specific three dimensional, three parameter system of differential\nequations given by (1), the method of analysis and calculations explained in\nSection 3 can be adapted to the study of other systems with three or more\nphase variables and depending on three or more parameters.\nAcknowledgement: The first and second authors developed this work under the project CNPq Grant 473824/04-3.
