The key mathematical notion is that of a quantum instrument,\nwhich we shall describe in Section 2 and which, for arbitrary quantum experiments, specifies the\njoint probability distribution of the observational outcome of the experiment together with the\nstate of the physical system after the experiment. Concurrently with these theoretical developments, major advances in experimental techniques have opened many possibilities for studying\nsmall quantum systems and this has led to considerable current interest in a range of questions\nthat in essence belong to statistical inference and are concerned with the amount of information\nabout unknown parameters in given observational data or accessible through various possible types\nof measurements. In quantum physics, the realm of possible experiments is specified mathematically, and noncommutativity between experiments plays a key role. Separate measurements on\nindependent and separate systems result in independent observations, as in classical stochastics.\nHowever, joint measurements allow for major increases in statistical information.\nThe present paper outlines some of these developments and contains suggestions for additional\nreadings and further work. We make some new contributions to the theory of quantum statistical\ninference, in particular, developing new notions of quantum sufficiency and exhaustivity. We\ngive complete but short proofs of the quantum information (Cram\u00e9r\u2013Rao) bound and some of its\nconsequences, filling some gaps in the proofs in the physics literature. The paper does not contain\npractical examples in the sense of real data analyses, for several reasons. For one thing, the\nrealistic modelling of present-day laboratory experiments in this field involves several more layers\nof complexity (technical, not conceptual) on top of the picture presented here. The closest we come\nto real data is in our discussion of quantum tomography in Section 7.2. For another thing, the\ntheory in this paper is largely concerned with the design rather than the analysis of experiments in\nquantum physics, and there is still a gap between what is theoretically possible under the laws of\nquantum mechanics, and what is practically possible in the laboratory, though this gap is closing\nfast. 'Information' is understood throughout in the sense it has in mathematical statistics. We\ndo not discuss quantum information theory in the sense of optimal coding and transmission of\nmessages through quantum communication channels, nor in the more general sense of quantum\ninformation processing (Green, 2000). Within quantum statistics, we concentrate on the topics\nof estimation and of inference. The classic books of Helstrom (1976) and Holevo (1982) are on\nthe other hand largely devoted to a decision theoretic approach to hypothesis testing problems.\nSee Parthasarathy (1999) and Ogawa and Nagaoka (2000) for recent contributions to this field.\nConfusingly, the phrase 'maximum likelihood estimator' has an unorthodox meaning in the older\nliterature. In many papers of which we just mention a few recent ones, Belavkin (1994, 2000,\n2001) develops a continuous time Bayesian filtering approach to estimation and control.\nIt should be emphasised from the start, that we see quantum mechanics as describing classical probability models for the outcomes of laboratory experiments, or indeed, for the real world\noutcomes of any interactions between 'the quantum world' of microscopic particles and 'the real\nworld' in which statisticians analyse data. Those probability models may depend on unknown\nparameters, and quantum statistics is concerned with statistical design and inference concerning\nthose parameters. This point of view is commonplace in experimental quantum physics but seems\nto be less common in theoretical physics and in some parts of pure mathematics, in particular\nin the field called 'quantum probability', where a special nature is claimed for the randomness of\nquantum mechanics, placing it outside the ambit of classical probability and statistics. We disagree firmly with this conclusion though we do agree that there are fascinating foundational issues\nin quantum mechanics. We develop our stance on these issues further in Section 8. Quantum\nmechanics is concerned with randomness of the most fundamental nature known to science, and\nprobabilists and statisticians definitely should be involved in the game, rather than excluded from\nit.\n3\n\n\fIn quantum mechanics the state of a physical system is described by a non-negative self-adjoint\noperator \u03c1 (referred to as the state) with trace 1, on a separable complex Hilbert space H. In\naccordance with the previous paragraphs, our interest in this paper concerns cases where the state\nis specified only up to some unknown parameter \u03b8 and the question is what can be learned about\nthe parameter from observation of the system.\nMany of the central ideas can be illustrated by finite-dimensional quantum systems, the simplest being based on those in which H has (complex) dimension 2. We shall often use the phrase\n'spin-half particle' to refer to such a quantum system, as one of the best known examples concerns\nthe magnetic moment or spin of the electron, which in appropriate units can only take on the\nvalues \u00b1 21 . But a two-dimensional state space is also appropriate for modelling the polarisation\nof one photon, and yet another example is provided by an atom at very low temperature when\nonly its ground state and first excited state are relevant. The theory of quantum computation\nis concerned with how a finite collection of two-dimensional quantum systems, which are then\ncalled qubits, can be used to carry and manipulate information. We shall mainly concentrate\non such examples. However, many physical problems concern infinite-dimensional systems, one\narea of great current interest being quantum tomography and quantum holography, which we\nshall discuss briefly. While the theory for finite-dimensional systems can be outlined in relatively\nsimple mathematical terms, in general it is necessary to draw on advanced aspects of the theory\nof operators on infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces and we will only outline this, with quantum\ntomography in mind, in Section 7.\nThe paper is organised as follows. Section 2 describes the mathematical structure linking\nstates of a quantum system, possible measurements on that system, and the resulting state of\nthe system after measurement. Section 3 introduces quantum statistical models and notions of\nquantum score and quantum information, parallel to the score function and Fisher information\nof classical parametric statistical models. In Section 4 we introduce quantum exponential models\nand quantum transformation models, again forming a parallel with fundamental classes of models\nin classical statistics. In Section 5 we describe the notions of quantum exhaustivity and quantum\nsufficiency of a measurement, relating them to the classical notion of sufficiency. We next, in\nSection 6, turn to a study of the relation between quantum information and classical Fisher\ninformation, in particular through Cram\u00e9r\u2013Rao type information bounds. In Section 7 we discuss\nthe infinite-dimensional model of quantum tomography, which poses the challenge of developing\nnon-parametric quantum information bounds. In Section 8 we discuss the difference between\nclassical and quantum probability and statistics, relating them both to foundational issues in\nquantum physics and to emerging quantum technologies. Finally in Section 9 we conclude with\nremarks on further topics, in particular, quantum stochastic processes. The appendix contains\nsome mathematical details.\nThis paper greatly extends our more mathematical survey (Barndorff-Nielsen, Gill, and Jupp,\n2001) on quantum statistical information. Gill (2001a,b) contains further introductory material.\nMany proofs and further details will be found in Barndorff-Nielsen, Gill, and Jupp (2002). Some\ngeneral references which we have found extremely useful are the books of Isham (1995), Peres\n(1995), Gilmore (1994), Holevo (1982, 2001c). Finally, the Los Alamos National Laboratory\npreprint service for quantum physics, quant-ph at http://xxx.lanl.gov is an invaluable resource.\n\n2\n\nStates, Measurements and Instruments\n\nIn quantum mechanics the state of any physical system to be investigated is described by an\noperator \u03c1 on a complex separable Hilbert space H such that \u03c1 is non-negative and (hence) selfadjoint and has trace 1. In this paper (except for Section 7) we shall restrict attention to the case\nwhere H is finite-dimensional, and our examples will mainly concern the spin of spin-half particles,\nwhere the dimension of H is 2. The classic example in this context is the 1922 experiment of Stern\nand Gerlach, see Brandt and Dahmen (1995, Section 1.4), to determine the size of the magnetic\nmoment of the electron. The electron was conceived of as spinning around an axis and therefore\nbehaving as a magnet pointing in some direction. Mathematically, each electron carries a vector\n4\n\n\f'magnetic moment'. One might expect the size of the magnetic moment of all electrons to be the\nsame, but the directions to be uniformly distributed in space. Stern and Gerlach made a beam of\nsilver atoms move transversely through a steeply increasing vertical magnetic field. A silver atom\nhas 47 electrons but it appears that the magnetic moments of the 46 inner electrons cancel and\nessentially only one electron determines the spin of the whole system. Classical physical reasoning\npredicts that the beam would emerge spread out vertically according to the component of the spin\nof each atom (or electron) in the direction of the gradient of the magnetic field. The spin itself\nwould not be altered by passage through the magnet. However, amazingly, the emerging beam\nconsisted of just two well separated components, as if the component of the spin vector in the\nvertical direction of each electron could take on only two different values.\nIn this case, H can be thought of as C2 , i.e. as pairs of complex numbers, and, correspondingly,\n\u03c1 is a 2 \u00d7 2 matrix\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03c111 \u03c112\n\u03c121 \u03c122\nwith \u03c121 = \u03c112 (the bar denoting complex conjugation) and non-negative real eigenvalues p1 and\np2 satisfying p1 + p2 = 1.\nThe result of performing a measurement on the system in state \u03c1 is a random variable x taking\nvalues in a measure space (X , A) and with law of the form\nPr(x \u2208 A) = tr{\u03c1M (A)} ,\nwhere M is a mapping from the \u03c3-algebra A into the space SA+ (H) of non-negative self-adjoint\noperators on H which satisfies M (X ) = 1 (where 1 is the identity operator) and\n\u221e\nX\n\nM (Ai ) = M (A)\n\ni=1\n\nfor any finite or countable sequence {A1 , A2 , . . . } of disjoint elements of A and A = \u222a\u221e\ni=1 Ai (the\nsum in the formula being defined in the sense of weak convergence of operators). Such a mapping\nM is said to be a (generalised) measurement. We shall also refer to M as an operator-valued\nprobability measure or OProM for short. In the literature the usual names and acronyms are\nprobability operator-valued measure or positive operator-valued measure (POM or POVM), and\n(nonorthogonal, generalised) resolution of the identity.\nThe most basic measurements, which are among the class of simple measurements defined in\nSection 2.2, have X a finite set of real numbers, with cardinality less than or equal to the dimension\nof H, A as the \u03c3-algebra of all subsets of X , M ({x})\nP = \u03a0[x] for any atom {x} of A, the \u03a0[x] being\nmutually orthogonal projection operators with\n\u03a0[x] = 1. We speak then of a projector-valued\nprobability measure or PProM. The usual terminology in the literature is a PVM or (orthogonal)\nresolution of the identity. All the ingredients of such a simple measurement are encapsulated in\nthe specification of a self-adjoint operator Q on H with eigenvalues x in X and eigenspaces\nwhich\nP\nare precisely those subspaces onto which the \u03a0[x] project. The operator Q =\nx\u03a0[x] is called\nthe observable. Conversely, any self-adjoint operator on H can be given an interpretation as an\nobservable. We denote the space of self-adjoint operators (observables) by SA(H) and the set of\nstates \u03c1 by S(H). The adjoint of an operator is indicated by an asterisk \u2217.\nPhysics textbooks on quantum theory usually take the concept of observables as a starting point. In the infinite dimensional case, observables-self-adjoint operators, not necessarily\nbounded-may have continuous spectrum instead of discrete eigenvalues. But the one-to-one correspondence between PProM's and observables continues to hold. Any self-adjoint operator on H\ncan be given an interpretation as an observable.\nLet M be a measurement. We shall often assume that M is dominated by a \u03c3-finite measure\n\u03bd on (X , A) and we shall write m(x) for the density of M with respect to \u03bd. Thus\nZ\nm(x)\u03bd(dx) .\nM (A) =\nA\n\n5\n\n\fWe can take m(x) to be self-adjoint and nonnegative for all x. (If H = Cd , then M (A) and m(x)\nmay be considered as d \u00d7 d matrices of complex numbers.) The law of x is also dominated by \u03bd\nand the probability density function of x is\np(x) = tr{\u03c1m(x)} .\nThe physical state may depend on an unknown parameter \u03b8, which runs through some parameter space \u0398. In this case we denote the state by \u03c1(\u03b8). Then the law of the outcome x of\na measurement M depends on \u03b8 as well and we indicate this by writing P\u03b8 (A) or p(x; \u03b8) for the\nprobability or the probability density, as the case may be. In particular,\np(x; \u03b8) = tr{\u03c1(\u03b8)m(x)} .\n\n(1)\n\nIt may also be relevant to stress the dependence on M and we then write p(x; \u03b8; M ), etc. We shall\nrefer to the present kind of setting as a parametric quantum model (\u03c1, M ) or (\u03c1, m) with elements\n\u03c1 = (\u03b8 7\u2192 \u03c1(\u03b8)) and M , or its density m. It is also relevant to consider cases where the measurement\nM depends on some unknown parameter, but we shall not discuss this possibility further in the\npresent paper. When the measurement M is given, a problem of classical statistical inference\nresults concerning the model (1) for the distribution of the outcome. However, it turns out that\nthe model for the state \u03b8 7\u2192 \u03c1(\u03b8) can be usefully studied independently of which measurement is\nmade of the system (or in order to choose the best measurement) and then quantum analogues of\nmany concepts from classical statistical inference become important.\nOProM's specify the probabilistic law of the outcome of an actual measurement but do not say\nanything about the state of the physical system after the measurement has been performed. The\nmathematical concept of quantum instrument prescribes both the OProM for the measurement\nand the posterior state.\nThe next three subsections discuss in more detail the concepts of states, measurements (or\nOProM's), and quantum instruments.\n\n2.1\n\nStates\n\nAs stated at the beginning of the section, the state of a quantum system is represented by an\noperator \u03c1 in S(H). It is often called the density matrix or density operator of the system. We\nthink of vectors \u03c8 in H as column vectors, and will emphasise this by writing |\u03c8i (Dirac's 'ket'\nnotation). The adjoint (complex conjugate and transpose) of |\u03c8i is a row vector, which we denote\nby h\u03c8| (Dirac's 'bra' notation).\nThe simplest states, called pure states, are the projectors of rank one, i.e. they are of the form\n\u03c1 = |\u03c8ih\u03c8|, where \u03c8 is a unit vector in H (so h\u03c8|\u03c8i = 1), called the state-vector of the pure state\n\u03c1. If H has dimension d then the set S1 (H) of pure states can be identified with the complex\nprojective space CP d\u22121 . In particular, S1 (C2 ) can be identified with the sphere S 2 , which is\nknown in theoretical physics as the Poincar\u00e9 sphere, in quantum optics as the Bloch sphere, and\nin complex analysis as the Riemann sphere.\nExample 1 (Spin-half ). Take H = C2 , so that H has complex dimension 2, the space of general\noperators on H has real dimension 8, and the space SA(H) of self-adjoint operators on H has real\ndimension 4.\nThe space SA(H) is spanned by the identity matrix\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 0\n1 = \u03c30 =\n,\n0 1\ntogether with the Pauli matrices\n\u0012\n\u0013\n0 1\n\u03c3x =\n1 0\n\n\u03c3y =\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2212i\n0\n\n0\ni\n\n6\n\n\u0013\n\n\u03c3z =\n\n\u0012\n\n1\n0\n\n0\n\u22121\n\n\u0013\n\n.\n\n\fNote that \u03c3x , \u03c3y and \u03c3z satisfy the commutativity relations\n[\u03c3x , \u03c3y ] = 2i\u03c3z\n[\u03c3y , \u03c3z ] = 2i\u03c3x\n[\u03c3z , \u03c3x ] = 2i\u03c3y\nwhere, for any operators A and B, their commutator [A, B] is defined as AB \u2212 BA; and note that\n\u03c3x2 = \u03c3y2 = \u03c3z2 = 1 .\nAny pure state has the form |\u03c8ih\u03c8| for some unit vector |\u03c8i in C2 . Up to a complex factor of\nmodulus 1 (the phase, which does not influence the state), we can write |\u03c8i as\n\u0012 \u2212i\u03c6/2\n\u0013\ne\ncos(\u03b8/2)\n|\u03c8i =\n.\nei\u03c6/2 sin(\u03b8/2)\nThe corresponding pure state is\n\u0013\n\u0012\ncos2 (\u03b8/2)\ne\u2212i\u03c6 cos(\u03b8/2) sin(\u03b8/2)\n.\n\u03c1 = i\u03c6\ne cos(\u03b8/2) sin(\u03b8/2)\nsin2 (\u03b8/2)\nA little algebra shows that \u03c1 can be written as \u03c1 = (1 + ux \u03c3x + uy \u03c3y + uz \u03c3z )/2 = 21 (1 + ~u * ~\u03c3 ),\nwhere ~\u03c3 = (\u03c3x , \u03c3y , \u03c3z ) are the three Pauli spin matrices and ~u = (ux , uy , uz ) = ~u(\u03b8, \u03c6) is the point\non S 2 with polar coordinates (\u03b8, \u03c6).\n2.1.1\n\nMixing and Superposition\n\nThere are two important ways of constructing new states from old. Firstly, since the set of states\nis convex, new states can be obtained by mixing states \u03c11 , . . . , \u03c1m , i.e. taking convex combinations\np 1 \u03c11 + * * * + p m \u03c1m ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere p1 , . . . , pm are real with pi \u2265 0 and p1 + * * * + pm = 1. If H is finite-dimensional then\nall states are of the form (2) with the \u03c1i pure, so that S(H) is the convex hull of S1 (H): in the\ninfinite-dimensional case one needs infinite mixtures. For this reason, states which are not pure\nare called mixed states. In particular, if H = C2 then the set of pure states is the Poincar\u00e9 sphere,\nwhereas the set of mixed states is the interior of the corresponding unit ball.\nIf H = Cd then mixing the pure states by the uniform probability measure on CP d\u22121 gives a\nstate which is invariant under the action \u03c1 7\u2192 U \u03c1U \u2217 of SU(d), the group of special (determinant\n+1) unitary (U U \u2217 = U \u2217 U = 1) matrices of order d; this is the unique such invariant state.\nThe other important way of constructing new states from old is by superposition. The superposition principle states that a complex linear combination of state-vectors is also a physically\npossible state-vector. Let |\u03c81 ih\u03c81 |, . . . , |\u03c8m ih\u03c8m | be pure states on H. Then any state which can\nbe written in the form h\u03c8|\u03c8i\u22121 |\u03c8ih\u03c8|, where\n\u03c8 = w1 \u03c81 + * * * + wm \u03c8m\nand w1 , . . . , wm are some complex numbers, is called a superposition of the pure states with statevectors |\u03c81 i, . . . , |\u03c8m i (here the phases of the state-vectors are relevant!).\nThe difference between superposition and mixing may be illustrated by a\u221aspin-half example:\ntake h\u03c81 | = (1, 0) and h\u03c82 | = (0, 1). For the superposition with w1 = w2 = 1/ 2, we have\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1 1\n,\nh\u03c8|\u03c8i\u22121 |\u03c8ih\u03c8| = 21\n1 1\nwhereas the mixed state\np1 |\u03c81 ih\u03c81 | + p2 |\u03c82 ih\u03c82 | =\n7\n\n1\n2\n\n\u0012\np1\n0\n\n0\np2\n\n\u0013\n\n\fis different from the preceding superposition, whatever p1 and p2 = 1 \u2212 p1 . Taking p1 = p2 = 21 ,\nif we measure the PProM defined by the two projectors |\u03c81 ih\u03c81 | and |\u03c82 ih\u03c82 | and corresponding\noutcomes +1 and \u22121, the two states are indistinguishable: each gives probabilities of 1/2 for the\ntwo outcomes. However, if we measure h\u03c8|\u03c8i\u22121 |\u03c8ih\u03c8| and |\u03c8i\u22a5 h\u03c8|\u22a5 , where |\u03c8i\u22a5 denotes a unit\nvector in C2 orthogonal to |\u03c8i, then the second state again gives each outcome probability half,\nwhile the first state gives probabilities 1 and 0.\nThe possibility of taking complex superpositions of state-vectors to get new pure states corresponds to the wave-particle duality at the heart of quantum mechanics (linear combinations of\nsolutions to wave equations are also solutions to wave equations). The new states obtained in this\nway will have distinctively different properties from the states out of which they are constructed.\nOn the other hand, taking mixtures of states represents no more and no less than ordinary probabilistic mixtures: with probability pi the system has been prepared in state \u03c1i , for i = 1, . . . , m.\nIt is a fact that whatever physical predictions one makes about a quantum system, they will depend on the |\u03c8i i and on the pi or wi involved in mixed states or superpositions only through\nthe corresponding matrix \u03c1. Since the representation of \u03c1 as a mixture of pure states and the\nrepresentation of a pure state as a superposition of other pure states are highly non-unique, we\ndraw the conclusion that very different ways of preparing a quantum system, which result in the\nstate \u03c1, cannot be distinguished from one another by any measurement whatsoever on the quantum system. This is a most remarkable feature of quantum mechanics, of absolutely non-classical\nphysical nature.\n2.1.2\n\nThe Schr\u00f6dinger Equation\n\nTypically the state of a particle undergoes an evolution with time under the influence of an external\nfield. The most basic type of evolution is that of an arbitrary initial state \u03c10 under the influence\nof a field with Hamiltonian H. This takes the form\n\u03c1t = etH/i~ \u03c10 e\u2212tH/i~ ,\nwhere \u03c1t denotes the state at time t, ~ is Planck's constant, and H is a self-adjoint operator on\nH. If \u03c10 is a pure state then \u03c1t is pure for all t and we can choose unit vectors \u03c8t such that\n\u03c1t = |\u03c8t ih\u03c8t | and\n\u03c8t = etH/i~ \u03c80 .\n(3)\nEquation (3) is a solution of the celebrated Schr\u00f6dinger equation i~(d/dt)\u03c8 = H\u03c8 or equivalently\ni~(d/dt)\u03c1 = [H, \u03c1].\n2.1.3\n\nSeparability and Entanglement\n\nWhen we study several quantum systems (with Hilbert spaces H1 , . . . , Hm ) interacting together,\nthe natural model for the combined system has as its Hilbert space the tensor product H1 \u2297 * * * \u2297\nHm . Then a state such as \u03c11 \u2297 * * * \u2297 \u03c1m represents 'particle 1 in state \u03c11 and . . . and particle m in\nstate \u03c1m '. Suppose the states \u03c1i are pure with state-vectors \u03c8i . Then the product state we have\njust defined is also pure with state-vector \u03c81 \u2297 * * * \u2297 \u03c8m . According to the superposition principle,\na complex superposition of such state vectors is also a possible state-vector of the interacting\nsystems. Pure states which cannot be written in the product form \u03c11 \u2297 * * * \u2297 \u03c1m are called\nentangled. The same term is used for mixed states which cannot be written as a mixture of pure\nproduct states. A state which is not entangled, is called separable. The existence of entangled\nstates is responsible for extraordinary quantum phenomena, which scientists are only just starting\nto harness (in quantum communication, computation, teleportation, etc.; see Section 8 for an\nintroduction).\nAn important physical feature of unitary evolution in a tensor product space is that, in general,\nit does not preserve non-entangledness of states. Suppose that the state \u03c11 \u2297 \u03c12 evolves according\nto the Schr\u00f6dinger operator Ut = etH/i~ on H1 \u2297 H2 . In general, if H does not have the special\nform H1 \u2297 12 + 11 \u2297 H2 , the corresponding state at any non-zero time is entangled. The notorious\n8\n\n\fSchr\u00f6dinger Cat, see Section 8.4, is a consequence of this phenomenon of entanglement. For an\nillustrative discussion of this see, for instance, Isham (1995, Sect. 8.4.2).\n2.1.4\n\nSpin-j\n\nSo far, our concrete examples have had a two-dimensional Hilbert space. Quantum systems in\nwhich the Hilbert space H is finite-dimensional are sometimes called spin systems. A spin-j\nsystem, where j is a positive half-integer, is one for which the Hilbert space is C2j+1 . A physical\ninterpretation of a spin-j system is in terms of a particle having spin angular momentum j.\nAn important class of spin-j systems can be obtained from pure spin-half systems as follows.\nLet |\u03c8i be a state vector representing a spin-half particle in a pure state \u03c1. Then the quantum\nsystem consisting of n independent particles, all prepared in this state, is represented by the state\nvector \u2297n |\u03c8i in \u2297n C2 . Such state vectors lie in (and span) the subspace\n\u2299n C2 = span{\u2297n |\u03c8i : |\u03c8i \u2208 C2 }\nof \u2297n C2 . The corresponding states have the form \u2297n \u03c1 and are sometimes known as (angular\nmomentum) coherent spin-j states.\nLet {|\u03c80 i, |\u03c81 i} be any basis of C2 . Put j = n/2 and, for m = \u2212j, . . . , j, define |mi in \u2299n C2\nby\n!\nn\nX\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u2212j\nk\nn\u2212k\n|mi = 2 \u03a0\u2299\n,\n(4)\n\u2297 |\u03c80 i \u2297 \u2297\n|\u03c81 i\nk=0\n\nwhere \u03a0\u2299 denotes the orthogonal projection from \u2297n C2 to \u2299n C2 . The formula\n\u22972j (\u03b1|\u03c80 i + \u03b2|\u03c81 i) =\n\n\u0012 \u0013\nj\nX\n2j j+m j\u2212m\n\u03b1\n\u03b2\n|mi\nm\nm=\u2212j\n\n\u03b1, \u03b2 \u2208 C\n\n(which can be obtained by binomial expansion) shows that {|mi : m = \u2212j, . . . , j} spans \u2299n C2 . It\nis easy to check that this is a basis, and so \u2299n C2 has dimension 2j + 1.\nExample\n\u221a 2 (Coherent Spin-1 states). Take j = 2. Then {|\u03c80 i \u2297 |\u03c80 i, (|\u03c80 i \u2297 |\u03c81 i + |\u03c81 i \u2297\n|\u03c80 i)/ 2, |\u03c81 i \u2297 |\u03c81 i} is a basis of \u22992 C2 . Thus \u22992 C2 can be identified with C3 , whereas \u22972 C2\n4\n2 2\n2 2\ncan be identified with\n\u221a C . The subspace of \u2297 C orthogonal to \u2299 C is spanned by (|\u03c80 i \u2297\n|\u03c81 i \u2212 |\u03c81 i \u2297 |\u03c80 i)/ 2. The corresponding state is known as the singlet or Bell state and helps\nto demonstrate non-classical properties of quantum mechanics; see Section 8.2.\nSpin-1 coherent states can be described in matrix terms as follows. If \u03c1 = 12 (1 + ux \u03c3x + uy \u03c3y +\nuz \u03c3z ) is a pure state on C2 then u2x + u2y + u2z = 1 and\n\u03c1\u2297\u03c1=\n\n1\b\n1 + 2(ux Sx + uy Sy + uz Sz ) + u2x \u03c3x \u2299 \u03c3x + u2y \u03c3y \u2299 \u03c3y + u2z \u03c3z \u2299 \u03c3z\n4\n\nwhere, in terms of the basis {| \u2212 12 i, |0i, | 21 i}\n\uf8eb\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n0 1 0\n1 \uf8ed\n1\nSx = \u221a\n1 0 1 \uf8f8 Sy = \u221a \uf8ed\n2\n2\n0 1 0\n\nof \u22992 C2 ,\n\u2212i\n0\ni\n\n0\ni\n0\n\nand\n\n\uf8eb\n\n0\n\u03c3x \u2299 \u03c3x = \uf8ed 0\n1\n\n0\n1\n0\n\n\uf8f6\n1\n0 \uf8f8\n0\n\n\uf8eb\n\n0\n\u03c3y \u2299 \u03c3y = \uf8ed 0\n\u22121\n\n9\n\n0\n1\n0\n\n\uf8f6\n0\n\u2212i \uf8f8\n0\n\uf8f6\n\u22121\n0 \uf8f8\n0\n\n\uf8eb\n1\n1 \uf8ed\n0\nSz = \u221a\n2\n0\n\uf8eb\n\n1\n\u03c3z \u2299 \u03c3z = \uf8ed 0\n0\n\n0\n\u22121\n0\n\n0\n\u22121\n0\n\n,\n\n\uf8f6\n0\n0 \uf8f8\n\u22121\n\uf8f6\n0\n0 \uf8f8.\n1\n\n\f2.2\n\nMeasurements\n\nOperator-valued probability measures, or OProM's, were introduced in the beginning of the present\nsection. We shall denote by OProM(X , H) the set of OProM's on X .\nAs indicated earlier, a basic kind of operator-valued probability measures consists of those in\nwhich the operators M (A) are orthogonal projections. Specifically, a projector-valued probability\nmeasure (or PProM, also called a simple measurement ) is an operator-valued probability measure\nM such that\nM (A) = M (A)\u2217 = M (A)2\nA \u2208 A.\nWe shall denote by PProM(X , H) the set of PProM's on X . As we noted, when the outcome space\nX is R, the PProM's stand in one-to-one correspondence with the self-adjoint operators on H,\nwhich in this context are also called observables. If one measures the observable X on a quantum\nsystem in state \u03c1, it turns out that the expected value of the outcome is given by the trace rule\nX\nX\nE(meas(X; \u03c1)) =\nxtr{\u03c1\u03a0[x] } = tr{\u03c1\nx\u03a0[x] } = tr{\u03c1X}.\n(5)\nx\n\nx\n\nExample 3 (Spin-half, cont.). For any unit vector \u03c8 of C2 , the observable 2|\u03c8ih\u03c8| \u2212 1 =\n|\u03c8ih\u03c8| \u2212 |\u03c8 \u22a5 ih\u03c8 \u22a5 | defines a PProM. It has eigenvalues 1 and \u22121 and one-dimensional eigenspaces\nspanned by \u03c8 and \u03c8 \u22a5 . This operator measures the spin of the particle in the direction (on the\nPoincar\u00e9 sphere) defined by \u03c8. We mentioned two of such measurements in Section 2.1.1 on mixing\nand superposition.\nExample 4 (Spin-half, cont.). In particular, with X = {\u22121, 1}, the specification\nM ({+1}) =\nM ({\u22121}) =\n\n1\n2 (1\n1\n2 (1\n\n+ \u03c3x )\n\u2212 \u03c3x )\n\ndefines an element of PProM(X , C2 ). It corresponds to the observable \u03c3x : spin in the x-direction.\nWe next discuss the notion of quantum randomisation whereby adding an auxiliary quantum\nsystem to a system under study gives one further possibilities for probing the system of interest.\nThis also connects to the important notion of realisation: representing generalised measurements\nby simple measurements on a quantum randomised extension.\nSuppose given a Hilbert space H, and a pair (K, \u03c1a ), where K is a Hilbert space and \u03c1a is a state\nf in OProM(X , H \u2297 K) induces a measurement M in OProM(X , H)\non K. Any measurement M\nwhich is determined by\nn\no\nf(A)\ntr {\u03c1M (A)} = tr (\u03c1 \u2297 \u03c1a )M\n\u03c1 \u2208 S(H), A \u2208 A .\n(6)\nThe pair (K, \u03c1a ) is called an ancilla. The following theorem (Holevo's extension of Naimark's\nTheorem, see Appendix A.2) states that any measurement M in OProM(X , H) is of the form (6) for\nf in PProM(X , H \u2297 K). The triple (K, \u03c1a , M\nf)\nsome ancilla (K, \u03c1a ) and some simple measurement M\nis called a realisation of M (the words extension or dilation are also used sometimes). Adding an\nancilla before taking a simple measurement could be thought of as quantum randomisation.\nTheorem 1 (Holevo 1982). For every M in OProM(X , H), there is an ancilla (K, \u03c1a ) and an\nf of PProM(X , H \u2297 K) which form a realisation of M .\nelement M\n\nWe use the term quantum randomisation, because of its analogy with the mathematical representation of randomisation in classical statistics, whereby one replaces the original probability\nspace with a product space, one of whose components is the original space of interest, while the\nother corresponds to an independent random experiment with probabilities under the control of\n\n10\n\n\fthe experimenter. Just as randomisation in classical statistics is sometimes needed to solve optimisation problems of statistical decision theory, quantum randomisation sometimes allows for\nstrictly better solutions than can be obtained without it.\nHere is a simple spin-half example of an OProM which cannot be represented without quantum\nrandomisation.\nExample 5 (The triad). The triad, or Mercedes-Benz logo, has an outcome space consisting\nof just three outcomes: let us call them 1, 2 and 3. Let ~vi , i = 1, 2, 3, denote three unit vectors\nin the same plane through the origin in R3 , at angles of 120\u25e6 to one another. Then the matrices\nM ({i}) = 13 (1 + ~vi * ~\u03c3 ) define an OProM on the sample space {1, 2, 3}. It turns up as the optimal\nsolution to the decision problem: suppose a spin-half system is generated in one of the three states\n\u03c1i = 12 (1 \u2212 ~vi * ~\u03c3 ), i = 1, 2, 3, with equal probabilities. What decision rule gives the maximum\nprobability of guessing the actual state correctly? There is no way to equal the success probability\nof this method, if one uses only simple measurements, even allowing for (classically) randomised\nprocedures.\nFinally, we introduce some further terminology concerning measurements. Given an OProM\nM and a measurable function T from its outcome space X to another space Y, one can define a\nnew measurement M \u2032 = M \u25e6 T \u22121 with outcome space Y. It corresponds to restricting attention to\nthe function T of the outcome of the first measurement M . We call it a coarsening of the original\nmeasurement, and conversely we say that M is a refinement of M \u2032 .\nA measurement M is called dominated by a (real, sigma-finite) measure \u03bd on the outcome\nspace, if there exists a non-negative\nself-adjoint matrix-valued function m(x), called the density of\nR\nM , such that M (B) = B m(x)\u03bd(dx) for all B. In the finite-dimensional case every measurement\nis dominated: take \u03bd(B) = trace(M (B)).\nTo exemplify these notions, suppose for some dominated measurement M one can write m(x) =\nm1 (x) + m2 (x) for two non-negative self-adjoint matrix-valued functions m1 and m2 . Then one\ncan define a refinement M \u2032 of M as the measurement on the outcome space X \u2032 = X \u00d7 {1, 2} with\ndensity mi (x), (x, i) \u2208 X \u2032 , with respect to the product of \u03bd with counting measure.\nWe described earlier how one can form product spaces from separate quantum systems, leading\nto notions of product states, separable states, and entangled states. Given an OProM M on one\ncomponent of a product space, one can naturally talk about 'the same measurement' on the\nproduct system. It has components M (B) \u2297 1. Given measurements M and M \u2032 defined on the\ntwo components of a product system, one can define in a natural way the measurement 'apply\nsimultaneously M and M \u2032 to each component': its outcome space is the product of the two\noutcome spaces, and it is defined using obvious notation by M \u2297 M \u2032 (B \u00d7 B \u2032 ) = M (B) \u2297 M \u2032 (B \u2032 ).\nA measurement M on a product space is called separable if it has a density m such that\neach m(x) can be written as a positive linear combination of tensor products of non-negative\ncomponents. It can then be thought of as a coarsening of a measurement with density m\u2032 such\nthat each m\u2032 (y) is a product of non-negative components.\n\n2.3\n\nInstruments\n\nWhen a physical measurement is made on a quantum system, the system usually changes state\nin some stochastic manner. Thus a complete description of the measurement specifies not just\nthe probability distribution of the outcome x but also the new state of the system when the\noutcome is x. We shall refer to the states of the system before and after measurement as the prior\nstate and the posterior state, and use the notation N to denote a particular mapping from prior\nstates to probability distributions over outcomes, with a particular posterior state associated with\neach outcome and given prior state. Such mappings are called instruments (Davies and Lewis\n1970; Davies 1976). Because of the basic rules of quantum mechanics, an instrument cannot be\ncompletely arbitrary but must satisfy certain constraints. We shall describe these constraints after\nwe have introduced some further notation.\nThe word 'instrument' is not very illuminating. The concept which we are trying to catch here\nis that of any interaction between a quantum system and the real world. The interaction will\n11\n\n\fchange the state of the quantum system, and cause changes in the real world. One can think of\nthese changes as being information recorded in classical physical systems. Data stored on a CDROM or printed on paper is just one kind of classical physical information. A measurement, in the\nsense of a deliberately carried out experiment, is just one kind of interaction. The data which are\navailable to an experimenter, after a measurement has been done, form only part of the totality of\nchanges which have happened in the real world. So one can distinguish between what is somehow\nimprinted in the real world as a result of the interaction which takes place when the instrument\nis applied to the quantum system, and a coarsened or reduced version of this information, which\nis the outcome of the measurement as it is available to the experimenter. What is relevant for\nthe experimenter is the final state of the quantum system, conditioned on the data which he has\navailable. This is typically different from the final state of the quantum system, conditioned on\nthe final state of the real world.\nIn the following, the outcome of the instrument will refer to the data available to the experimenter, and the posterior state means the final state (possibly mixed) of the quantum system\ngiven this information only.\nConsider an instrument N with outcomes x in the measurable space (X , A). Let \u03c0(dx; \u03c1, N )\ndenote the probability distribution of the outcome of the measurement, and let \u03c3(x; \u03c1, N ) denote\nthe posterior state when the prior state is \u03c1 and the outcome of the measurement is x. Now let\nY denote some observable on the quantum system and let A \u2208 A denote a measurable set of\noutcomes. Suppose one 'measures the instrument' on the state \u03c1, registers whether or not the\noutcome is in A, and subsequently measures the observable Y . Then the expected value of the\nindicatorR of the event 'outcome is in A' times the outcome of measuring the observable Y is the\nnumber A \u03c0(dx; \u03c1, N )tr{(\u03c3(x; \u03c1, N )Y }, by using the trace rule (5). Now it turns out that this\nnumber, seen as a function of prior state \u03c1, measurable subset of outcomes A, and observable Y ,\ndetermines N completely. By the interpretation of mixed states as probability mixtures, it follows\nthat the expression is linear in \u03c1 and therefore can be rewritten as tr{\u03c1N (A)[Y ]} where N (A)[Y ],\nfor each event A in the outcome space and each observable Y , is a uniquely defined (possibly\nunbounded) self-adjoint operator on H. This linearity constraint restricts considerably the class\nof all possible (\u03c0, \u03c3). One can show that N (A)[Y ] must be countably additive in the argument A,\nlinear and positive in Y (positive in the sense of mapping nonnegative operators to nonnegative\noperators), and normalised in the sense that N (X )[1] = 1.\nThus, mathematically, an instrument N can be specified equally well by giving the probability\ndistribution of the outcome of the measurement \u03c0(dx; \u03c1, N ), together with the posterior state\n\u03c3(x; \u03c1, N ), as by giving an operator N (A)[Y ] for each A and Y . The physical constraints imposed\nby quantum theory restrict the possible (\u03c0, \u03c3), and equivalently restrict the possible N (A)[Y ].\nThe second specification is less direct but more convenient from a theoretical point of view, since\nthe physical constraints (additivity, linearity, positivity, normalization) are much more simple to\nexpress in those terms. In a moment we indicate that, on further physical considerations, the\npositivity condition should be strengthened to a condition called complete positivity.\nFollowing Ozawa (1985), we show how to recover (\u03c0, \u03c3) from N . The first step is to read off\nthe measurement or OProM M which is determined by the instrument N , when we ignore the\nposterior state. This is given by the prescription\nM (A) = N (A)[1] .\n\n(7)\n\nThe probability that the measurement of the state \u03c1 results in an outcome in A is given by\n\u03c0(A; \u03c1, N ) = tr{\u03c1N (A)[1]}.\nIf the system was in state \u03c1 just before the measurement then the state of the system after the\nmeasurement, given that the measurement was observed to result in an outcome belonging to A,\nis determined as the solution \u03c3(A; \u03c1, N ) of the equation\ntr{\u03c3(A; \u03c1, N )Y } =\n\ntr{\u03c1N (A)[Y ]}\ntr{\u03c1N (A)[1]}\n12\n\nY \u2208 B(H)\n\n\f(provided that tr{\u03c1N (A)[1]} > 0). Finally, the family \u03c3(x; \u03c1, N ) of posterior states is characterised\n(almost everywhere, with respect to \u03c0) by\nZ\ntr{\u03c1N (A)[Y ]} =\ntr{\u03c3(x; \u03c1, N )Y }\u03c0(dx; \u03c1, N )\nY \u2208 B(H)\nA \u2208 A.\nA\n\nAn extremely important class of quantum instruments consists of those of the form\nX\nWi (x)\u2217 Y Wi (x)\u03bd(dx) ,\nN (dx)[Y ] =\n\n(8)\n\ni\n\nwhere \u03bd is a \u03c3-finite measure on X (and, without loss of generality, can be taken to be a probability\nmeasure), the index i runs over some finite or countable set, and Wi is a measurable function from\nX to B(H) such that\nXZ\nWi (x)Wi (x)\u2217 \u03bd(dx) = 1 .\ni\n\nX\n\nFor such quantum instruments, the posterior states are\nP\nWi (x)\u2217 \u03c1Wi (x)\n\u03c3(x; \u03c1, N ) = P i\n\u2217\ni tr{\u03c1Wi (x)Wi (x) }\nand the distribution of the outcome is\n\n\u03c0(dx; \u03c1, N ) =\n\nX\ni\n\ntr{\u03c1Wi (x)Wi (x)\u2217 }\u03bd(dx).\n\nSuch quantum instruments are almost generic, in the sense that an instrument which satisfies the\nfurther physically motivated condition of complete positivity can be represented as in (8), except\nthat the operators Wi (x) need not be bounded (in which case the formulae we have given need to\nbe interpreted with some care).\nThe mathematical definition of complete positivity is given in Appendix A.1. Its intuitive\nmeaning is as follows. We can consider the instrument as acting not just on the system of interest\nH but also on a completely arbitrary system K somewhere else in the universe. If the systems are\nindependent, we can express the joint state as a tensor product, and the instrument acts on it by\ntransforming the system of interest as we have already specified, while leaving the auxiliary system\nunchanged; the posterior joint state remains a product state. Now once we have specified how\nthe extended instrument acts on product states, one can calculate how it acts on any joint state,\nincluding entangled states, by using the linearity which is a basic feature of quantum physics. To\nbe physically meaningful, this extended instrument has to be positive, in the sense of mapping\nstates (nonnegative matrices) to states (after all, the system we are studying may actually be in an\nentangled state with a system elsewhere). The mathematical statement of this physical property\nis called complete positivity.\nFormulae like (8) are known in the physics literature as Kraus representations. If we allow\nunbounded instruments for which the self-adjoint operator N (A)[Y ] is not necessarily bounded for\nall A and Y , then the Wi (x) need not be bounded either. In this case posterior states may not be\ndefined for each outcome of the measurement, but only for each measurable collection of outcomes\nof positive probability. Allowing unbounded operators as well as bounded makes a difference only\nin infinite dimensional spaces, see Example 15 in Appendix A.1 Key references on instruments and\ncomplete positivity are Stinespring (1955), Davies and Lewis (1970), Davies (1976), Kraus (1983),\nOzawa (1985), Loubenets (1999, 2000), and Holevo (2001c).\nExample 6 (Simple Instruments). Let {\u03a0[x] : x \u2208 X } define a PProM on a finite-dimensional\nP\nquantum system, corresponding to the simple measurement of the observable Q =\nx\u03a0[x] . One\ncan embed this measurement in many different instruments, i.e., the state could be transformed\nby the measurement in many different ways. However the most simple description possible is\nobtained when one takes, in (8), \u03bd to be counting measure on the finite set X , the set of indices\n13\n\n\fi to contain a single element, and Wi (x) = W (x) = \u03a0[x] . We call this particular instrument the\ncorresponding simple instrument. If one applies it to a system in the pure state with state-vector\n\u03c8, and observes the outcome x, then the state of the system remains pure but now has state vector\n\u03a0[x] \u03c8/k\u03a0[x]\u03c8k. The probability of this event is precisely k\u03a0[x] \u03c8k2 . When the state transforms in\nthis way, one says that von Neumann's or L\u00fcders' projection postulate holds for the measurement\nof the observable Q.\nTwo observables Q, P are called compatible if as operators they commute. For a Borel measurable function f : R \u2192 R and an observable R with eigenvalues\nr and eigenspaces the ranges of\nP\nthe projectors \u03a0[R=r] , the observable f (R) is the operator\nf (r)\u03a0[R=r] . A celebrated result of\nvon Neumann is that observables Q and P are compatible if and only if they are both functions\nf (R), g(R) of a third observable R. Taking R to have as coarse a collection of eigenspaces as\npossible, one can show that the results of the following three instruments are identical: the simple\ninstrument for Q followed by the simple instrument for P , recording the values q of Q and p of P ;\nthe simple instrument for P followed by the simple instrument for Q, recording the values q of Q\nand p of P ; and the simple instrument for R, recording the values q = f (r) and p = g(r) where r\nis the observed value of R.\nIt follows that the probability distribution of the outcome of measurement of an observable P is\nnot altered when it is measured (simply, jointly) together with any other compatible observables.\nNote that the expected value of the outcome of a measurement of the observable Q on a quantum\nsystem in state \u03c1 is tr{\u03c1Q}, and the expected value of the real function f of this outcome is\ntr{\u03c1f (Q)}, identical to the expectation of the outcome of a measurement of the observable f (Q).\nWe call this rule the law of the unconscious quantum physicist since it is analogous to the law\nof the unconscious statistician, according to which the expectation of a function Y = f (X) of a\nrandom variable X may be calculated by an integration (i) over the underlying probability space,\n(ii) over the outcome space of X, (iii) over the outcome space of Y .\nA useful consequence of this calculus of functions of observables is that the characteristic\nfunction of the distribution of a measurement of an observable Q is equal to tr{\u03c1eitQ }. Since\nQ is self-adjoint, eitQ is unitary and the trace may have a physical interpretation which aids its\ncalculation.\nFurther results of Ozawa (1985) generalise the realisability of measurements (Naimark, Holevo\ntheorems) to the realisability of an arbitrary completely positive instrument. Namely, after forming\na compound system by taking the tensor product with some ancilla, the instrument can be realised\nas a unitary (Schr\u00f6dinger) evolution for some length of time, followed by the action of a simple\ninstrument (measurement of an observable, with state transition according to von Neumann's\nprojection postulate). Therefore to say that the most general operation on a quantum system is\na completely positive instrument comes down to saying: the only mechanisms known in quantum\nmechanics are Schr\u00f6dinger evolution, von Neumann measurement, and forming compound systems\n(entanglement). Combining these ingredients in arbitrary ways, one remains within the class of\ncompletely positive instruments; moreover, anything in that class can be realised in this way.\nJust as we introduced notions of coarsening and refinement for OProM's, and discussed OProM's\non product systems, one can do the same (and more) for instruments. The extra ingredient is\ncomposition. Since the description of an instrument includes the state of the system after the\nmeasurement by the instrument, we are able to define mathematically the composition of two\ninstuments, corresponding to the notion of applying first one instrument, and then the second,\nwhile registering the outcomes (data) produced at each of the two stages. The outcome space\nof the composition of two instruments is the product of the two respective outcome spaces. A\nmore complicated form of composition is possible, in which the second instrument is replaced by a\nfamily of instruments, indexed by possible outcomes of the first instrument. Informally: apply the\nfirst instrument, then choose a second instrument depending on the outcome of the first; keep the\noutcomes of both. We do not write out the mathematical formalism for describing these rather\nnatural concepts.\nFor coarsening, we do write out some formal details, since we need later to refer to a specific\nresult. Let N denote an instrument on a Hilbert space H and with outcome space (X , A) and let\n14\n\n\fN \u2032 be a coarsening of N , i.e. N \u2032 is an instrument on the same Hilbert space H, with outcome\nspace (Y, B), and there is a mapping T from (X , A) to (Y, B) such that\nN \u2032 (B)[*] = N (T \u22121 (B))[*]\nfor all B \u2208 B. This mathematical formalism defines the instrument corresponding to applying the\ninstrument N , registering the result of applying the function T to the outcome x, and discarding\nx. Because of this interpretation, one has the following relation between the posterior states\n\u03c3(x; \u03c1, N ) and \u03c3(t; \u03c1, N \u2032 ):\nZ\n\u2032\n\u03c3(t; \u03c1, N ) =\n\u03c3(x; \u03c1, N )\u03c0(dx|t; \u03c1, N ),\n(9)\nT \u22121 (t)\n\nwhere \u03c0(dx|t; \u03c1, N ) is the conditional distribution of x given T (x) = t computed from \u03c0(dx; \u03c1, N ).\nAn instrument defined on one component of a product system can be extended in a natural way\n(similar to that described in Section 2.2 for measurements) to an instrument on the product system.\nConversely, it is of great interest whether instruments on a product system can in some way be\nreduced to 'separate instruments on the separate sub-systems'. There are two important notions in\nthis context. The first (similar to the concept of separability of measurements) is the mathematical\nconcept of separability of an instrument defined on a product system: this is that each Wi (x) in\nsome representation (8) is a tensor product of separate matrices for each component. The second\nis the physical property which we shall call multilocality: an instrument is called multilocal, if it\ncan be represented as a coarsening of a composition of separate instruments applied sequentially\nto separate components of the product system, where the choice of each instrument at each stage\nmay depend on the outcomes of the instruments applied previously. Moreover, each component of\nthe system may be measured several times (i.e., at different stages), and the choice of component\nmeasured at the nth stage may depend on the outcomes at previous stages. One should think of the\ndifferent components of the quantum system as being localised at different locations in space. At\neach location separately, anything quantum is allowed, but all communication between locations\nis classical. It is a theorem of Bennett et al. (999a) that every multilocal instrument is separable,\nbut that (surprisingly) not all separable instruments are multilocal. It is an open problem to find\na physically meaningful characterisation of separability, and conversely to find a mathematically\nconvenient characterisation of multilocality. (Note, our terminology is not standard: the word\n'unentangled' is used by some authors instead of separable, and 'separable' instead of multilocal).\nNot all joint measurements (by which we just mean instruments on product systems), are separable, let alone multilocal. Just as quantum randomised measurements can give strictly more\npowerful ways to probe the state of a quantum system than (combinations of) simple measurements and classical randomisation, so non-separable measurements can do strictly better than\nseparable measurements at extracting information from product systems, even if a priori there is\nno interaction of any kind between the subsystems; this is a main conclusion of Section 6.3.\n\n3\n\nParametric Quantum Models and Likelihood\n\nA measurement from a parametric quantum model (\u03c1, m) results in an observation x with density\np(x; \u03b8) = tr{\u03c1(\u03b8)m(x)}\nand log likelihood\nl(\u03b8) = log tr{\u03c1(\u03b8)m(x)} .\nFor simplicity, let us suppose \u03b8 is one-dimensional. For the calculation of log likelihood derivatives in the present setting it is convenient to work with the symmetric logarithmic derivative or\nquantum score of \u03c1, denoted by \u03c1//\u03b8 . This is defined implicitly as the self-adjoint solution of the\nequation\n\u03c1/\u03b8 = \u03c1 \u25e6 \u03c1//\u03b8 ,\n(10)\n15\n\n\fwhere \u25e6 denotes the Jordan product, i.e.\n\u03c1 \u25e6 \u03c1//\u03b8 = 21 (\u03c1\u03c1//\u03b8 + \u03c1//\u03b8 \u03c1) ,\n\u03c1/\u03b8 denoting the ordinary derivative of \u03c1 with respect to \u03b8 (term by term differentiation in matrix\nrepresentations of \u03c1). (We shall often suppress the argument \u03b8 in quantities like \u03c1, \u03c1/\u03b8 , \u03c1//\u03b8 , etc.)\nThe quantum score exists and is essentially unique subject only to mild conditions (for a discussion\nof this see, for example, Holevo 1982).\nThe likelihood score l/\u03b8 (\u03b8) = (d/d\u03b8)l(\u03b8) may be expressed in terms of the quantum score \u03c1//\u03b8 (\u03b8)\nof \u03c1(\u03b8) as\nl/\u03b8 (\u03b8) = p(x; \u03b8)\u22121 tr{\u03c1/\u03b8 (\u03b8)m(x)}\n= p(x; \u03b8)\u22121 12 tr {(\u03c1(\u03b8)\u03c1//\u03b8 (\u03b8) + \u03c1//\u03b8 (\u03b8)\u03c1(\u03b8))m(x)}\n= p(x; \u03b8)\u22121 R tr {\u03c1(\u03b8)\u03c1//\u03b8 (\u03b8)m(x)} ,\n\nwhere we have used the fact that for any self-adjoint operators P, Q, R on H the trace operation\nsatisfies tr{P QR} = tr{RQP } and R tr{Q} = 12 tr{Q + Q\u2217 }. It follows that\nE\u03b8 [l/\u03b8 (\u03b8)] = tr{\u03c1(\u03b8)\u03c1//\u03b8 (\u03b8)} .\nThus, since the mean value of l/\u03b8 is 0, we find that\ntr{\u03c1(\u03b8)\u03c1//\u03b8 (\u03b8)} = 0 .\n\n(11)\n\nThe expected (Fisher) information i(\u03b8) = i(\u03b8; M ) = E\u03b8 [l/\u03b8 (\u03b8)2 ] may be written as\nZ\n\b\n2\ni(\u03b8; M ) = p(x; \u03b8)\u22121 R tr{\u03c1(\u03b8)\u03c1//\u03b8 (\u03b8)m(x)} \u03bd(dx) .\n\n(12)\n\nIt plays a key role in the quantum context, just as in classical statistics, and is discussed in Section\n6. In particular, we will there discuss its relation with the expected or Fisher quantum information\nI(\u03b8) = tr{\u03c1(\u03b8)\u03c1//\u03b8 (\u03b8)2 }.\n\n(13)\n\nThe quantum score is a self-adjoint operator, and therefore may be interpreted as an observable\nwhich one might measure on the quantum system. What we have just seen is that the outcome\nof a simple measurement of the quantum score has mean zero, and variance equal to the quantum\nFisher information.\n\n4\n\nQuantum Exponential and Quantum Transformation Models\n\nIn traditional statistics, the two major classes of parametric models are the exponential models\n(in which the log densities are affine functions of appropriate parameters) and the transformation\n(or group) models (in which a group acts in a consistent fashion on both the sample space and the\nparameter space); see Barndorff-Nielsen and Cox (1994). The intersection of these classes is the\nclass of exponential transformation models, and its members have a particularly nice structure.\nThere are quantum analogues of these classes, and they have useful properties.\n\n4.1\n\nQuantum Exponential Models\n\nA quantum exponential model is a quantum statistical model for which the states \u03c1(\u03b8) can be\nrepresented in the form\n1\n\n\u03c1(\u03b8) = e\u2212\u03ba(\u03b8)e 2 \u03b3\n\nr\n\n(\u03b8)Tr\u2217\n\n1\n\n\u03c10 e 2 \u03b3\n\n16\n\nr\n\n(\u03b8)Tr\n\n\u03b8 \u2208 \u0398,\n\n\fwhere \u03b3 = (\u03b3 1 , . . . , \u03b3 k ) : \u0398 \u2192 Ck , T1 , . . . , Tk are operators on H, \u03c10 is self-adjoint and nonnegative (but not necessarily a density matrix), the Einstein summation convention (of summing\nover any index which appears as both a subscript and a superscript) has been used, and \u03ba(\u03b8) is a\nlog norming constant, given by\n1\n\n\u03ba(\u03b8) = log tr{e 2 \u03b3\n\nr\n\n(\u03b8)Tr\u2217\n\n1\n\n\u03c10 e 2 \u03b3\n\nr\n\n(\u03b8)Tr\n\n}.\n\nThree important special types of quantum exponential model are those in which T1 , . . . , Tk are\nbounded and self-adjoint, (and for the first type, T0 , T1 , . . . ,Tk all commute) and the quantum\nstates have the forms\n\u03c1(\u03b8) = e\u2212\u03ba(\u03b8) exp {T0 + \u03b8r Tr }\n\b\n\b\n\u03c1(\u03b8) = e\u2212\u03ba(\u03b8) exp 21 \u03b8r Tr \u03c10 exp 12 \u03b8r Tr\n\b\n\b\n\u03c1(\u03b8) = exp \u2212i 21 \u03b8r Tr \u03c10 exp i 21 \u03b8r Tr ,\n\n(14)\n(15)\n(16)\n\nrespectively, where \u03b8 = (\u03b81 , . . . , \u03b8k ) \u2208 Rk and \u03c10 \u2208 SA+ (H), and the summation convention is in\nforce.\nWe call these three types, the quantum exponential models of mechanical type, symmetric\ntype, and unitary type respectively. The mechanical type arises (at least, with k = 1) in quantum\nstatistical mechanics as a state of statistical equilibrium, see Gardiner and Zoller (2000, Sect.\n2.4.2). The symmetric type has theoretical statistical significance, as we shall see, connected\namong other things to the fact that the quantum score for this model is easy to compute explicitly.\nThe unitary type has physical significance connected to the fact that it is also a transformation\nmodel (quantum transformation models are defined in the next subsection). The mechanical type\nis a special case of the symmetric type when T0 , T1 , . . . ,Tk all commute.\nIn general, the statistical model obtained by applying a measurement to a quantum exponential\nmodel is not an exponential model (in the classical sense). However, for a quantum exponential\nmodel of the form (15) in which\nTj = tj (X) j = 1, . . . , k\n\nfor some X in SA(H) ,\n\n(17)\n\ni.e., the Tj commute, the statistical model obtained by applying the measurement X is a full\nexponential model. Various pleasant properties of such quantum exponential models then follow\nfrom standard properties of the full exponential models.\nThe classical Cram\u00e9r\u2013Rao bound for the variance of an unbiased estimator t of \u03b8 is\nVar(t) \u2265 i(\u03b8; M )\u22121 .\n\n(18)\n\nCombining (18) with Braunstein and Caves' (1994) quantum information bound i(\u03b8; M ) \u2264 I(\u03b8),\nwhich we derive as (31) in Section 6.2, yields Helstrom's (1976) quantum Cram\u00e9r\u2013Rao bound\nVar(t) \u2265 I(\u03b8)\u22121 ,\n\n(19)\n\nwhenever t is an unbiased estimator based on a quantum measurement. It is a classical result that,\nunder certain regularity conditions, the following are equivalent: (i) equality holds in (18), (ii) the\nscore is an affine function of t, (iii) the model is exponential with t as canonical statistic (cf. pp.\n254\u2013255 of Cox and Hinkley 1974). This result has a quantum analogue, see Theorems 3 and 4\nand Corollary 1 below, which states that under certain regularity conditions, there is equivalence\nbetween (i) equality holds in (19) for some unbiased estimator t based on some measurement\nM , (ii) the symmetric quantum score is an affine function of commuting T1 , . . . , Tk , and (iii) the\nquantum model is a quantum exponential model of type (15) where T1 , . . . , Tk satisfy (17). The\nregularity conditions which we assume below are indubitably too strong: the result should be true\nunder minimal smoothness assumptions.\n\n17\n\n\f4.2\n\nQuantum Transformation Models\n\nConsider a parametric quantum model (\u03c1, M ) consisting of a family \u03c1 = {\u03c1(\u03b8) : \u03b8 \u2208 \u0398} of states\nand a measurement M with outcome space (X , A). Suppose there exists a group, G, with elements\ng, acting both on X and on \u0398 in such a way that the following consistency condition holds\ntr{\u03c1(\u03b8)M (A)} = tr{\u03c1(g\u03b8)M (g \u22121 A)}\n\n(20)\n\nfor all \u03b8, A and g. If, moreover, G acts transitively on \u0398 we say that (\u03c1, M ) is a quantum transformation model. In this case, the resulting statistical model for the outcome of a measurement of M ,\ni.e. (X , A, P), where P = tr{\u03c1(\u03b8)M } : \u03b8 \u2208 \u0398}, is a classical transformation model. Consequently,\nthe Main Theorem for transformation models, see Barndorff-Nielsen and Cox (1994, pp. 56\u201357)\nand references given there, applies to (X , A, P).\nOf particular physical interest are situations where the actions of G are such that\nM (g \u22121 A) = Ug\u2217 M (A)Ug\n\nA \u2208 A,\n\n\u03c1(g\u03b8) = Ug\u2217 \u03c1(\u03b8)Ug ,\n\n(21)\n(22)\n\nwhere the Ug are unitary matrices satisfying\ng, h \u2208 G ,\n\nUgh = w(g, h)Ug Uh\n\n(23)\n\nfor some complex valued function w with |w(g, h)| = 1 for all g and h. A mapping g 7\u2192 Ug with the\nproperty (23) is said to constitute a projective unitary representation of G and a measurement M\nsatisfying (21) is termed covariant in the physical literature; equivariant would be a more correct\nterminology. Under certain conditions, equivariant measurements are representable in the form\nZ\nM (A) =\nUg\u2217 R0 Ug \u03bc(dg)\n{g:g\u22121 x0 \u2208A}\n\nfor an invariant measure \u03bc on G, a fixed non-negative self-adjoint operator R0 on H and some\nfixed point x0 \u2208 X .\nExample 7 (Equivariant measurements for spin-half ). Suppose both outcome space X and\ngroup G are the unit circle S 1 . Let the Hilbert space H be C2 and let S 1 act on H via the\nprojective representation\n\u0012 i\u03c6/2\n\u0013\ne\n0\n\u03c6 7\u2192 U\u03c6 =\n\u03c6 \u2208 S1 .\n0\ne\u2212i\u03c6/2\nThen by Holevo (1982, p. 175 with j = 12 ) any equivariant M has\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\naei\u03c6\nm(\u03c6) =\nae\u2212i\u03c6\n1\nwith respect to the uniform distribution on S 1 , for some a with |a| \u2264 1.\nExample 8 (Equivariant measurements for spin-j). The preceding example generalises to\nspin-j coherent states. Again, both the outcome space X and the group G are the unit circle S 1 .\nNow let the Hilbert space H be \u2299n C2 . Define the operator J on H by\nJ=\n\nj\nX\n\nm|mihm| ,\n\nm=\u2212j\n\nwhere j = n/2 and |mi is defined in (4). Then putting\nU\u03c6 = ei\u03c6J\n18\n\n\u03c6 \u2208 S1\n\n\fgives a projective representation of S 1 on H. By Holevo (1982, p. 175) any equivariant measurement has density\nm(\u03c6) = e\u2212i\u03c6J R0 ei\u03c6J\nwith respect to the uniform distribution on S 1 , for some positive operator R0 satisfying\nZ 2\u03c0\n1\ne\u2212i\u03c6J R0 ei\u03c6J d\u03c6 = 1 .\n2\u03c0 0\n\n4.3\n\nQuantum Exponential Transformation Models\n\nA quantum exponential transformation model is a quantum exponential model which is also a\nquantum transformation model. The pleasant properties of classical exponential transformation\nmodels (Barndorff-Nielsen et al., 1982) are shared by a large class of quantum exponential transformation models of the form (15) which satisfy (17). In particular, if H is finite-dimensional\nand the group acts transitively then there is a unique affine action of the group on Rk such that\n(t1 , . . . , tk ) : X \u2192 Rk is equivariant.\nExample 9 (Spin-half: great circle model). Consider the spin-half model \u03c1(\u03b8) = U 12 (1 +\ncos \u03b8\u03c3x +sin \u03b8\u03c3y ) U \u2217 where U is a fixed 2\u00d72 unitary matrix, and \u03c3x and \u03c3y are two of the Pauli spin\nmatrices, while the parameter \u03b8 varies through [0, 2\u03c0); see Example 1. The matrix U can always be\nwritten as exp(\u2212i\u03c6~u *~\u03c3 ) for some real three-dimensional unit vector ~u and angle \u03c6. Considered as a\ncurve on the Poincar\u00e9 sphere, the model forms a great circle. If U is the identity (or, equivalently,\n\u03c6 = 0) the curve just follows the line of the equator; the presence of U corresponds to rotating the\nsphere carrying this curve about the direction ~u through an angle \u03c6. Thus our model describes an\narbitrary great circle on the Poincar\u00e9 sphere, parametrised in a natural way. Since we can write\n\u03c1(\u03b8) = U V\u03b8 U \u2217 \u03c1(0)U V\u03b8\u2217 U \u2217 , where the unitary matrix V\u03b8 corresponds to rotation of the Poincar\u00e9\nsphere by an angle \u03b8 about the z-axis, we can write this model as a unitary transformation\nmodel of the form (22). Together with any equivariant measurement, this model forms a quantum\ntransformation model. The model is clearly also an exponential model of unitary type. Perhaps\nsurprisingly, it can be reparameterised so as also to be an exponential model of symmetric type.\nWe leave the details (which depend on the algebraic properties of the Paul spin matrices) to the\nreader, but just point out that a one-parameter pure-state exponential model of symmetric type\nhas to be of the form \u03c1(\u03b8) = exp(\u2212\u03ba(\u03b8)) exp( 21 \u03b8~u * ~\u03c3 ) 12 (1 + ~v * ~\u03c3 ) exp( 12 \u03b8~u * ~\u03c3 ) for some real unit\nvectors ~u and ~v , since every self-adjoint 2 \u00d7 2 matrix is an affine function of a spin matrix ~u * ~\u03c3 .\nNow write out the exponential of a matrix as its power series, and use the fact that the square of\nany spin matrix is the identity.\nThis example is due to Fujiwara and Nagaoka (1995).\n\n5\n\nQuantum Exhaustivity and Sufficiency\n\nThis section introduces and relates some concepts connected to the classical notion of sufficiency.\n\n5.1\n\nQuantum Exhaustivity\n\nAn important role is played by quantum instruments for which no information on the unknown parameter of a quantum parametric model of states can be obtained from subsequent measurements\non the given physical system.\nRecall that an instrument N is represented by a collection of observables N (A)[Y ], defined in\nthe following implicit fashion. For any particular A and Y , the expectation of the outcome of measuring the observable N (A)[Y ] on a system in state \u03c1, is the same as the expectation of a function\nof the joint outcomes of first applying the instrument to a system in state \u03c1 and next measuring\nthe observable Y on the posterior state: namely, take the product of the indicator variable that\n19\n\n\fthe outcome of the instrument is in A, with the outcome of the subsequent measurement of Y .\nThis collection of observables determines uniquely the probability distribution \u03c0(dx; \u03c1, N ) of the\noutcome of applying the instrument N to the state \u03c1, and the posterior state \u03c3(x; \u03c1, N ) given that\nthe outcome is x. They are related to the N (A)[Y ] by the equality (which we just expressed in\nwords)\nZ\ntr{\u03c1N (A)[Y ]} =\n\nA\n\ntr{\u03c3(x; \u03c1, N )Y }\u03c0(dx; \u03c1, N ).\n\nIn the sequel we will drop the name of the instrument in the notation for \u03c0 and \u03c3 and, when\nconsidering a parameterised family of prior states, replace the prior state \u03c1(\u03b8) by the parameter\nvalue \u03b8: thus \u03c0(dx; \u03b8) denotes the probability distribution of the outcome, and \u03c3(x; \u03b8) denotes the\nposterior state.\nDefinition 1 (Exhaustive instruments). A quantum instrument N is exhaustive for a parameterised set \u03c1 : \u0398 \u2192 S(H) of states if for all \u03b8 in \u0398 and for \u03c0(*; \u03b8)-almost all x, \u03c3(x; \u03b8) does not\ndepend on \u03b8.\nThus the posterior states obtained from exhaustive quantum instruments are completely determined by the result of the measurement and do not depend on \u03b8.\nA useful strong form of exhaustivity is defined as follows.\nDefinition 2 (Completely exhaustive instruments). A quantum instrument N is completely\nexhaustive if it is exhaustive for all parameterised sets of states.\nRecall that any completely positive instrument-in other words, virtually any physically realisable instrument-has the form (8) of N (A)[Y ], given by\nX\ntr{Wi (x)\u2217 Y Wi (x)}\u03bd(dx)\n(24)\nN (dx)[Y ] =\ni\n\nwith posterior states\n\nand outcome distributed as\n\nP\nWi (x)\u2217 \u03c1Wi (x)\n\u03c3(x; \u03c1) = P i\n\u2217\ni tr{\u03c1Wi (x)Wi (x) }\n\u03c0(dx; \u03c1) =\n\nX\ni\n\ntr{\u03c1Wi (x)Wi (x)\u2217 }\u03bd(dx).\n\nThe following Proposition (which is a slight generalisation of a result of Wiseman 1999) shows one\nway of constructing completely exhaustive completely positive quantum instruments.\nProposition 1. Let the quantum instrument N be as above, with Wi (x) of the form\nWi (x) = |\u03c8x ih\u03c6i,x | ,\nfor some functions (i, x) 7\u2192 \u03c6i,x and x 7\u2192 \u03c8x . Then N is completely exhaustive.\nProof. By inspection we find that the posterior state is\nP\n|\u03c6i,x ih\u03c6i,x |\n,\n\u03c3(x; \u03c1) = Pi\ni h\u03c6i,x |\u03c6i,x i\nwhich does not depend on the prior state \u03c1.\n\n20\n\n(25)\n\n\f5.2\n\nQuantum Sufficiency\n\nSuppose the measurement M \u2032 = M \u25e6 T \u22121 is a coarsening of the measurement M . In this situation\nwe say that M \u2032 is (classically) sufficient for M with respect to a family of states \u03c1 = {\u03c1(\u03b8) :\n\u03b8 \u2208 \u0398} on H if the mapping T is sufficient for the identity mapping on (X , A) with respect to\nthe family {P (*; \u03b8; M ) : \u03b8 \u2208 \u0398} of probability measures on (X , A) induced by M and \u03c1 (that is,\nP (*; \u03b8; M ) = tr{M (*)\u03c1(\u03b8)}).\nAs a further step towards a definition of quantum sufficiency, we introduce a concept of inferential equivalence of parametric models of states.\nDefinition 3 (Inferential equivalence). Two parametric families of states \u03c1 = {\u03c1(\u03b8) : \u03b8 \u2208 \u0398}\nand \u03c3 = {\u03c3(\u03b8) : \u03b8 \u2208 \u0398} on Hilbert spaces H and K are said to be inferentially equivalent if for\nevery measurement M on H there exists a measurement N on K such that for all \u03b8 \u2208 \u0398\ntr{M (*)\u03c1(\u03b8)} = tr{N (*)\u03c3(\u03b8)}\n\n(26)\n\nand vice versa. (Note that, implicitly, the outcome spaces of M and N are assumed to be identical.)\nIn other words, \u03c1 and \u03c3 are equivalent if and only if they give rise to the same class of possible\nclassical models for inference on the unknown parameter.\nExample 10 (Two identical spin-half particles vs. one coherent spinone particle). Let \u03c1 = {\u03c1(\u03b8) : \u03b8 \u2208 \u0398} be a parametric family of coherent spin-1 states; see\nSection 2.1.4 above. Then the associated Hilbert space H is C2 \u2297 C2 . Recall that the state vectors\nof coherent spin-1 states lie in the subspace K = C2 \u2299 C2 of C2 \u2297 C2 . Define the parametric\nfamily \u03c3 = {\u03c3(\u03b8) : \u03b8 \u2208 \u0398} by \u03c3(\u03b8) = \u03a0\u2299 \u03c1(\u03b8)\u03b9, where \u03a0\u2299 and \u03b9 are the orthogonal projection from\nC2 \u2297 C2 to C2 \u2299 C2 and the inclusion of K in H, respectively. Given a measurement M on H,\nwe can define a measurement N on K by N (*) = \u03a0\u2299 M (*)\u03b9. Similarly, given a measurement N on\nK, we can define a measurement M on H by M (*) = \u03b9N (*)\u03a0\u2299 . It is simple to verify that (26) is\nsatisfied, and so \u03c1 and \u03c3 are inferentially equivalent.\nRemark 1. It is of interest to find characterisations of inferential equivalence. This is a nontrivial\nproblem, even in the case where the Hilbert spaces H and K are the same.\nNext, let N denote an instrument on a Hilbert space H and with outcome space (X , A) and let\nN \u2032 = N \u25e6 T \u22121 be a coarsening of N with outcome space (Y, B), generated by a mapping T from\n(X , A) to (Y, B). According to (9) in Section 2.3, the posterior states for the two instruments are\nrelated by\nZ\n\u03c3(t; \u03b8, N \u2032 ) =\n\nT \u22121 (t)\n\n\u03c3(x; \u03b8, N )\u03c0(dx|t; \u03b8, N ),\n\nwhere \u03c0(dx|t; \u03b8, N ) is the conditional distribution of x given T (x) = t computed from \u03c0(dx; \u03b8, N ).\nDefinition 4 (Quantum sufficiency of instruments). Let N \u2032 be a coarsening of an instrument\nN by T : (X , A) \u2192 (Y, B). Then N \u2032 is said to be quantum sufficient with respect to a family of\nstates {\u03c1(\u03b8) : \u03b8 \u2208 \u0398} if\n(i) the measurement M \u2032 (*) = N \u2032 (*)[1] is sufficient for the measurement M (*) = N (*)[1], with\nrespect to the family {\u03c1(\u03b8) : \u03b8 \u2208 \u0398}\n(ii) for any x \u2208 X , the posterior families {\u03c3(x; \u03b8, N ) : \u03b8 \u2208 \u0398} and {\u03c3(T (x); \u03b8, N \u2032 ) : \u03b8 \u2208 \u0398} are\ninferentially equivalent.\n\n5.3\n\nExhaustivity, Sufficiency, Ancillarity and Separability\n\nIn the theory of classical statistical inference, many important concepts (such as sufficiency, ancillarity and cuts) can be expressed in terms of the decomposition by a measurable function\nT : (X , A) \u2192 (Y, B) of each probability distribution on (X , A) into the corresponding marginal\n21\n\n\fdistribution of T (x) and the family of conditional distributions of x given T (x). In quantum\nstatistics there are analogous concepts based on the decomposition\n\u03c1 7\u2192 (\u03c0(*; \u03c1, N ), \u03c3(*; \u03c1, N ))\n\n(27)\n\nby a quantum instrument N of each state \u03c1 into a measurement and a family of posterior states;\nsee Section 2.3.\nThe classical concept of a cut encompasses those of sufficiency and ancillarity and is therefore\nmore basic. A measurable function T is a cut for a set P of probability distributions on X if\nfor all p1 and p2 in P, the distribution on X obtained by combining the marginal distribution of\nT (x) given by p1 with the family of conditional distributions of x given T (x) given by p2 is also\nin P; see, e.g. p. 38 of Barndorff-Nielsen and Cox 1994. Recent results on cuts for exponential\nmodels can be found in (Barndorff-Nielsen and Koudou, 1995), which also gives references to the\nuseful role which cuts have played in graphical models. A generalisation to local cuts has become\nimportant in econometrics (Christensen and Kiefer, 1994, 2000). Replacing the decomposition\ninto marginal and conditional distributions in the definition of a cut by the decomposition (27)\nyields the following quantum analogue.\nDefinition 5 (Quantum cuts). A quantum instrument N is said to be a quantum cut for a\nfamily \u03c1 of states if for all \u03c11 and \u03c12 in \u03c1, there is a \u03c13 in \u03c1 such that\n\u03c0(*; \u03c13 , N ) = \u03c0(*; \u03c11 , N )\n\n\u03c3(*; \u03c13 , N ) = \u03c3(*; \u03c12 , N ).\nThus, if N is a quantum cut for a family \u03c1 = {\u03c1(\u03b8) : \u03b8 \u2208 \u0398} with \u03c1 a one-to-one function\nthen \u0398 has the product form \u0398 = \u03a8 \u00d7 \u03a6 and furthermore \u03c3(*; \u03c1(\u03b8), N ) depends on \u03b8 only through\n\u03c8, and \u03c0(*; \u03c1(\u03b8), N ) depends on \u03b8 only through \u03c6.\nExample 11 (Simple quantum cuts). Let {\u03a0[x] : x \u2208 X } be a PProM on a finite-dimensional\nquantum system. Suppose that sets \u03a8 and \u03a8 are given, together with collections of functions\n(indexed by x in X ) fx : \u03a6 \u2192 [0, 1] and Mx : \u03a8 \u2192 S(H) which satisfy\nX\nfx (\u03c6) = 1\n\u03c6\u2208\u03a6\nx\u2208X\n\nMx (\u03c8) = \u03a0[x] Mx (\u03c8)\u03a0[x]\n\n\u03c8 \u2208 \u03a8.\n\nThen we can define a family of states {\u03c1(\u03c8, \u03c6) : \u03c8 \u2208 \u03a8, \u03c6 \u2208 \u03a6} by\nX\n\u03c1(\u03c8, \u03c6) =\nfx (\u03c6)Mx (\u03c8)\n(\u03c8, \u03c6) \u2208 \u03a8 \u00d7 \u03a6.\nx\u2208X\n\nAs indicated in Example 6, {\u03a0[x] : x \u2208 X } gives rise to a simple quantum instrument N , defined\nby\nN ({x})[Y ] = \u03a0[x] Y \u03a0[x] .\nA straightforward calculation using the orthogonality of the projections \u03a0[x] shows that\n\u03c3(x; \u03c1(\u03c8, \u03c6), N ) = Mx (\u03c8)\n\u03c0(x; \u03c1(\u03c8, \u03c6), N ) = fx (\u03c6),\nand so N is a quantum cut for \u03c1.\nSince a quantum instrument is exhaustive for a parameterised set \u03c1 = {\u03c1(\u03b8) : \u03b8 \u2208 \u0398} of\nstates if the family \u03c3(*; \u03c1(\u03b8), N ) of posterior states does not depend on \u03b8, exhaustive quantum\ninstruments are quantum cuts of a special kind. They can be regarded as quantum analogues of\nsufficient statistics. At the other extreme are the quantum instruments for which the measurements\n22\n\n\f\u03c0(*; \u03c1(\u03b8), N ) do not depend on \u03b8. These can be regarded as quantum analogues of ancillary\nstatistics.\nUnlike exhaustivity, the concept of quantum sufficiency involves not only a quantum instrument\nbut also a coarsening. The definition of quantum sufficiency can be extended to the following\nversion involving parameters of interest.\nDefinition 6 (Quantum sufficiency for interest parameters). Let \u03c1 = {\u03c1(\u03b8) : \u03b8 \u2208 \u0398} be a\nfamily of states and let \u03c8 : \u0398 \u2192 \u03a8 map \u0398 to the space \u03a8 of interest parameters. A coarsening N \u2032\nof an instrument N by a mapping T is said to be quantum sufficient for \u03c8 on \u03c1 if\n(i) the measurement N \u2032 (*)[1] is sufficient for N (*)[1] with respect to the family \u03c1,\n(ii) for all \u03b81 and \u03b82 with \u03c8(\u03b81 ) = \u03c8(\u03b82 ) and for all x in X , the sets \u03c3(x; \u03c1(\u03b81 ), N ) and\n\u03c3(T (x); \u03c1(\u03b82 ), N \u2032 ) of posterior states are inferentially equivalent.\nConsideration of the likelihood function obtained by applying a measurement to a parameterised set of states suggest that the following weakening of the concept of inferential equivalence\nmay be useful.\nDefinition 7 (Weak likelihood equivalence). Two parametric families of states \u03c1 = {\u03c1(\u03b8) :\n\u03b8 \u2208 \u0398} and \u03c3 = {\u03c3(\u03b8) : \u03b8 \u2208 \u0398} on Hilbert spaces H and K respectively are said to be weakly\nlikelihood equivalent if for every measurement M on H there is a measurement N on K with the\nsame outcome space, such that\ntr{N (dx)\u03c3(\u03b8)}\ntr{M (dx)\u03c1(\u03b8)}\n=\ntr{M (dx)\u03c1(\u03b8\u2032 )}\ntr{N (dx)\u03c3(\u03b8\u2032 )}\n\n\u03b8, \u03b8\u2032 \u2208 \u0398\n\n(whenever these ratios are defined) and vice versa.\nThus the likelihood function of the statistical model obtained by applying M to \u03c1 is equivalent\nto that obtained by applying N to \u03c3, for the same outcome of each instrument.\nConsideration of the distribution of the likelihood ratio leads to the following definition.\nDefinition 8 (Strong likelihood equivalence). Two parametric families of states \u03c1 = {\u03c1(\u03b8) :\n\u03b8 \u2208 \u0398} and \u03c3 = {\u03c3(\u03b8) : \u03b8 \u2208 \u0398} on Hilbert spaces H and K respectively are said to be strongly likelihood equivalent if for every measurement M on H with outcome space X there is a measurement\nN on K with some outcome space Y such that the likelihood ratios\ntr{M (dx)\u03c1(\u03b8)}\ntr{M (dx)\u03c1(\u03b8\u2032 )}\n\nand\n\ntr{N(dy)\u03c3(\u03b8)}\ntr{N(dy)\u03c3(\u03b8\u2032 )}\n\nhave the same distribution for all \u03b8, \u03b8\u2032 in \u0398, and vice versa.\nThe precise connection between likelihood equivalence and inferential equivalence is not yet\nknown but the following conjecture appears reasonable.\nConjecture. Two quantum models are strongly likelihood equivalent if and only if they are\ninferentially equivalent up to quantum randomisation.\n\n6\n\nQuantum and Classical Fisher Information\n\nIn Section 3 we showed how to express the Fisher information in the outcome of a measurement in\nterms of the quantum score. In this section we discuss quantum analogues of Fisher information\nand their relation to the classical concepts.\n\n23\n\n\f6.1\n\nDefinition and First Properties\n\nDifferentiating (11) with respect to \u03b8, writing \u03c1//\u03b8/\u03b8 for the derivative of the symmetric logarithmic\nderivative \u03c1//\u03b8 of \u03c1, and using the defining equation (10) for \u03c1//\u03b8 and the fact that \u03c1 and \u03c1//\u03b8 are\nself-adjoint, we obtain\n0 = R tr{\u03c1/\u03b8 (\u03b8)\u03c1//\u03b8 (\u03b8) + \u03c1(\u03b8)\u03c1//\u03b8/\u03b8 (\u03b8)}\n\u0011\no\nn \u0010\n= R tr 12 \u03c1(\u03b8)\u03c1//\u03b8 (\u03b8) + \u03c1//\u03b8 (\u03b8)\u03c1(\u03b8) \u03c1//\u03b8 (\u03b8) + R tr{\u03c1(\u03b8)\u03c1//\u03b8/\u03b8 (\u03b8)}\n= I(\u03b8) \u2212 tr(\u03c1(\u03b8)J(\u03b8)) ,\n\nwhere\n\n\b\nI(\u03b8) = tr \u03c1(\u03b8)\u03c1//\u03b8 (\u03b8)2\n\nis the expected (or Fisher ) quantum information, already mentioned in Sections 3 and 4, and\nJ(\u03b8) = \u2212\u03c1//\u03b8/\u03b8 (\u03b8) ,\nwhich we shall call the observable quantum information. Thus\nI(\u03b8) = tr {\u03c1(\u03b8)J(\u03b8)} ,\nwhich is a quantum analogue of the classical relation i(\u03b8) = E\u03b8 [j(\u03b8)] between expected and observed information (where j(\u03b8) = \u2212l/\u03b8/\u03b8 (\u03b8)). Note that J(\u03b8) is an observable, just as j(\u03b8) is a\nrandom variable.\nNeither I(\u03b8) nor J(\u03b8) depends on the choice of measurement, whereas i(\u03b8) = i(\u03b8; M ) does\ndepend on the measurement M .\nFor parametric quantum models of states of the form\n\u03c1 : \u03b8 7\u2192 \u03c11 (\u03b8) \u2297 * * * \u2297 \u03c1n (\u03b8)\n(which model 'independent particles'), the associated expected quantum information satisfies\nI\u03c11 \u2297***\u2297\u03c1n (\u03b8) =\n\nn\nX\n\nI\u03c1i (\u03b8) ,\n\ni=1\n\nwhich is analogous to the additivity property of Fisher information. In particular, for parametric\nquantum models of states of the form\n\u03c1 : \u03b8 7\u2192 \u03c1(\u03b8) \u2297 * * * \u2297 \u03c1(\u03b8)\n\n(28)\n\n(which model n 'independent and identical particles'), the associated expected quantum information In satisfies\nIn (\u03b8) = nI(\u03b8) ,\n(29)\nwhere I(\u03b8) denotes the expected quantum information for a single measurement of the same type.\nIn the case of a multivariate parameter \u03b8, the expected quantum information matrix I(\u03b8) is\ndefined in terms of the quantum scores by\n\b\nI(\u03b8)jk = 12 tr \u03c1//\u03b8j (\u03b8)\u03c1(\u03b8)\u03c1//\u03b8k (\u03b8) + \u03c1//\u03b8k (\u03b8)\u03c1(\u03b8)\u03c1//\u03b8j (\u03b8) .\n(30)\n\n6.2\n\nRelation to Classical Expected Information\n\nSuppose that \u03b8 is one-dimensional. There is an important relationship between expected quantum\ninformation I(\u03b8) and classical expected information i(\u03b8; M ), due to Braunstein and Caves (1994),\nnamely that for any measurement M with density m with respect to a \u03c3-finite measure \u03bd on X ,\ni(\u03b8; M ) \u2264 I(\u03b8) ,\n24\n\n(31)\n\n\fwith equality if and only if, for \u03bd-almost all x,\nm(x)1/2 \u03c1//\u03b8 (\u03b8)\u03c1(\u03b8)1/2 = r(x)m(x)1/2 \u03c1(\u03b8)1/2 ,\n\n(32)\n\nfor some real number r(x). For a proof see Appendix B.\nFor each \u03b8, there are measurements which attain the bound in the quantum information inequality (31). For instance, we can choose M such that each m(x) is a projection onto an eigenspace\nof the quantum score \u03c1//\u03b8 (\u03b8). Note that this attaining measurement may depend on \u03b8.\nExample 12 (Information for spin-half ). Consider a spin-half particle in the pure state\n\u03c1 = \u03c1(\u03b7, \u03b8) = |\u03c8(\u03b7, \u03b8)ih\u03c8(\u03b7, \u03b8)| given by\n\u0012 \u2212i\u03b8/2\n\u0013\ne\ncos(\u03b7/2)\n|\u03c8(\u03b7, \u03b8)i =\n.\nei\u03b8/2 sin(\u03b7/2)\nAs we saw in Example 1 (where we wrote (\u03b7, \u03b8) for (\u03b7, \u03b8)), \u03c1 can be written as \u03c1 = (1 + ux \u03c3x +\nuy \u03c3y + uz \u03c3z )/2 = 21 (1 + ~u * ~\u03c3 ), where ~\u03c3 = (\u03c3x , \u03c3y , \u03c3z ) are the three Pauli spin matrices and\n~u = (ux , uy , uz ) = ~u(\u03b7, \u03b8) is the point on the Poincar\u00e9 sphere S 2 with polar coordinates (\u03b7, \u03b8).\nSuppose that the colatitude \u03b7 is known and exclude the degenerate cases \u03b7 = 0 or \u03b7 = \u03c0; the\nlongitude \u03b8 is the unknown parameter.\nSince all the \u03c1(\u03b8) are pure, one can show that \u03c1//\u03b8 (\u03b8) = 2\u03c1/\u03b8 (\u03b8) = ~u/\u03b8 (\u03b8) * ~\u03c3 = sin(\u03b7) ~u(\u03c0/2, \u03b8 +\n\u03c0/2) * ~\u03c3 . Using the properties of the Pauli matrices, one finds that the quantum information is\nI(\u03b8) = tr{\u03c1(\u03b8)\u03c1//\u03b8 (\u03b8)2 } = sin2 \u03b7.\nFollowing Barndorff-Nielsen and Gill (2000), we now state a condition that a measurement must\nsatisfy in order for it to achieve this information.\nIt follows from (32) that, for a pure spin-half state \u03c1 = |\u03c8ih\u03c8|, a necessary and sufficient\ncondition for a measurement to achieve the information bound is: for \u03bd-almost all x, m(x) is\nproportional to a one-dimensional projector |\u03be(x)ih\u03be(x)| satisfying\nh\u03be|2ih2|ai = r(x)h\u03be|1i ,\nwhere r(x) is real, |1i = |\u03c8i, |2i = |\u03c8i\u22a5 (|\u03c8i\u22a5 being a unit vector in C2 orthogonal to |\u03c8i) and\n|ai = 2|\u03c8i/\u03b8 . It can be seen that geometrically this means that |\u03be(x)i corresponds to a point on\nS 2 in the plane spanned by ~u(\u03b8) and ~u/\u03b8 (\u03b8).\nIf \u03b7 6= \u03c0/2, this is for each value of \u03b8 a different plane, and all these planes intersect in the\norigin only. Thus no single measurement M can satisfy I(\u03b8) = i(\u03b8; M ) for all \u03b8. On the other\nhand, if \u03b7 = \u03c0/2, so that the states \u03c1(\u03b8) lie on a great circle in the Poincar\u00e9 sphere, then the\nplanes defined for each \u03b8 are all the same. In this case any measurement M with all components\nproportional to projector matrices for directions in the plane \u03b7 = \u03c0/2 satisfies I(\u03b8) = i(\u03b8; M ) for\nall \u03b8 \u2208 \u0398. In particular, any simple measurement in that plane has this property.\nMore generally, a smooth one-parameter model of a spin-half pure state with everywhere\npositive quantum information admits a uniformly attaining measurement, i.e. such that I(\u03b8) =\ni(\u03b8; M ) for all \u03b8 \u2208 \u0398, if and only if the model is a great circle on the Poincar\u00e9 sphere. This is\nactually a quantum exponential transformation model, see Example 9.\nWhen the state \u03c1 is strictly positive, and under further nondegeneracy conditions, essentially\nthe only way to achieve the bound (31) is through measuring the quantum score. In the discussion\nbelow we first keep the value of \u03b8 fixed. Since any nonnegative self-adjoint matrix can be written\nas a sum of rank-one matrices (using its eigenvalue-eigenvector decomposition), it follows that any\ndominated measurement can be refined to a measurement for which each m(x) is of rank 1, thus\nm(x) = r(x)|\u03be(x)ih\u03be(x)| for some real r(x) and state-vector |\u03be(x)i, see the end of Section 2.2. If\none measurement is the refinement of another, then the distributions of the outcomes are related\nin the same way. Therefore, under refinement of a measurement, Fisher expected information\ncannot decrease. Therefore if any measurement achieves (31), there is also a measurement with\n25\n\n\frank 1 components achieving the bound. Consider such a measurement. Suppose that \u03c1 > 0 and\nthat all the eigenvalues of \u03c1//\u03b8 are different. The condition m(x)1/2 \u03c1//\u03b8 \u03c11/2 = r(x)m(x)1/2 \u03c11/2 is\nthen equivalent to |\u03be(x)ih\u03be(x)|\u03c1//\u03b8 = r(x)|\u03be(x)ih\u03be(x)|, which states that \u03be(x) is an eigenvector of\n\u03c1//\u03b8 . Since we must have m(x)\u03bc(dx) = 1, it follows that all eigenvectors of \u03c1//\u03b8 occur in this way\nin components m(x) of M . The measurement can therefore be reduced or coarsened (the opposite\nof refined) to a simple measurement of the quantum score, and the reduction (at the level of the\noutcome) is sufficient.\nSuppose now the state \u03c1(\u03b8) is strictly positive for all \u03b8, and that the quantum score has\ndistinct eigenvalues for at least one value of \u03b8. Suppose a single measurement exists attaining (31)\nuniformly in \u03b8. Any refinement of this measurement therefore also achieves the bound uniformly, in\nparticular, the refinement to components which are all proportional to projectors onto orthogonal\none-dimensional eigenspaces of the quantum score at the value of \u03b8 where the eigenvalues are\ndistinct. Therefore the eigenvectors of the quantum score at this value of \u03b8 are eigenvectors at\nall other values of \u03b8. Therefore there is a self-adjoint operator X with distinct eigenvalues such\nR\u03b8\nthat \u03c1//\u03b8 (\u03b8) = f (X; \u03b8) for each \u03b8. Fix \u03b80 and let F (X; \u03b8) = \u03b80 f (X; \u03b8)d\u03b8. Let \u03c10 = \u03c1(\u03b80 ). If we\nconsider the defining equation (10) as a differential equation for \u03c1(\u03b8) given the quantum score, and\nwith initial condition \u03c1(\u03b80 ) = \u03c10 , we see that a solution is \u03c1(\u03b8) = exp{ 12 F (X; \u03b8)}\u03c10 exp{ 21 F (X; \u03b8)}.\nUnder smoothness conditions the solution is unique. Rewriting the form of this solution, we come\nto the following theorem:\nTheorem 2 (Uniform attainability of quantum information bound). Suppose that the\nstate is everywhere positive, the quantum score has distinct eigenvalues for some value of \u03b8, and\nis smooth. Suppose that a measurement M exists with i(\u03b8; M ) = I(\u03b8) for all \u03b8, thus attaining the\nBraunstein\u2013Caves information bound (31) uniformly in \u03b8. Then there is an observable X such\nthat a simple measurement of X also achieves the bound uniformly, and the model is of the form\n\u03c1(\u03b8) = c(\u03b8) exp{ 12 F (X; \u03b8)}\u03c10 exp{ 21 F (X; \u03b8)}\n\n(33)\n\nfor a function F , indexed by \u03b8, of an observable X where c(\u03b8) = 1/tr{\u03c10 exp(F (X; \u03b8))}, \u03c1//\u03b8 (\u03b8) =\nf (X; \u03b8) \u2212 tr{\u03c1(\u03b8)f (X; \u03b8)}, and f (X; \u03b8) = F/\u03b8 (X; \u03b8). Conversely, for a model of this form, a\nmeasurement of X achieves the bound uniformly.\nRemark 2 (Spin-half case). For spin-half, if the information is positive then the quantum score\nhas distinct eigenvalues, since the outcome of a measurement of the quantum score always equals\none of the eigenvalues, has mean zero, and positive variance.\nTheorem 3 (Uniform attainability of quantum Cram\u00e9r\u2013Rao bound). Suppose the positivity and nondegeneracy conditions of the previous theorem are satisfied, and suppose that for\nthe outcome of some measurement M a statistic t exists which is for all \u03b8 an unbiased estimator\nof \u03b8 achieving Helstrom's quantum Cram\u00e9r\u2013Rao bound (19), Var(t) = I(\u03b8)\u22121 . Then the model is\nactually a quantum exponential model of symmetric type (15),\n\u03c1(\u03b8) = c(\u03b8) exp{ 21 \u03b8T }\u03c10 exp{ 21 \u03b8T }\n\n(34)\n\nfor some observable T , and simple measurement of T is equivalent to the coarsening of M according\nto t.\nProof. The coarsening of the measurement M \u2032 = M \u25e6 t\u22121 corresponding to t also achieves the\nquantum information bound (31) uniformly, i(\u03b8; M \u2032 ) = I(\u03b8). Apply Theorem 2 to this measurement and we discover that the model is of the form (33), while (if necessary refining the\nmeasurement to have rank one components) t can be considered as a function of the outcome of\na measurement of the observable X, and it achieves the classical Cram\u00e9r\u2013Rao bound for unbiased\nestimators of \u03b8 based on this outcome. Now the density of the outcome (with respect to counting\nmeasure on the eigenvalues of X) is found to be c(\u03b8) exp(F (x; \u03b8))tr{\u03c10 \u03a0[X=x] }. Hence, up to\naddition of functions of \u03b8 or x alone, F (x; \u03b8) is of the form \u03b8t(x).\n\n26\n\n\fExample 12 concerned pure spin-half models given by circles of constant latitude on the\nPoincar\u00e9 sphere. Taking the product of n identical copies of such a model produces a spin-j\nmodel, with j = n/2, parameterised by a circle. It follows from the discussion at the end of\nExample 12, (29) and the additivity of Fisher information that if such a spin-j model is given by\na great circle then there is a measurement M such that equality holds in (31).\nThe basic inequality (31) holds also when the dimension of \u03b8 is greater than one. In that case,\nthe quantum information matrix I(\u03b8) is defined in (30) and the Fisher information matrix i(\u03b8; M )\nis defined by\nirs (\u03b8; M ) = E\u03b8 [lr (\u03b8)ls (\u03b8)] ,\nwhere lr denotes l/\u03b8r etc. Then (31) holds in the sense that I(\u03b8) \u2212 i(\u03b8; M ) is positive semi-definite.\nThe inequality is sharp in the sense that I(\u03b8) is the smallest matrix dominating all i(\u03b8; M ).\nHowever it is typically not attainable, let alone uniformly attainable.\nTheorem 2 can be generalised to the case of a vector parameter. This also leads to a generalisation of Theorem 3, which is the content of Corollary 1 below. First we give a lemma.\nLemma 1.

Let \u03c1 : \u0398 \u2192 S(H) be a twice differentiable parametric quantum model. If\n(i) there is a measurement M with i(\u03b8; M ) = I(\u03b8) for all \u03b8,\n(ii) \u03c1(\u03b8) > 0 for all \u03b8,\n(iii) \u0398 is simply connected\nthen, for any \u03b80 in \u0398, there are an observable X and a function F (possibly depending on \u03b80 ) such\nthat\n\b\n\b\n\u03c1(\u03b8) = exp 12 F (X; \u03b8) \u03c1(\u03b80 ) exp 12 F (X; \u03b8) .\n\nProof. Since i(\u03b8; M ) = I(\u03b8), it follows from equation (32) and (iii) that there are real-valued\nfunctions r1 , . . . , rdim\u0398 on X \u00d7 \u0398 such that\nm(x)\u03c1//i (\u03b8) = ri (x, \u03b8)m(x),\nfor all \u03b8 in \u0398 and \u03bd-almost all x. Then\nm(x)\u03c1//i (\u03b8)\u03c1//j (\u03b8\u2032 ) = ri (x, \u03b8)rj (x, \u03b8\u2032 )m(x) = m(x)\u03c1//j (\u03b8\u2032 )\u03c1//i (\u03b8),\n27\n\n\ffor all \u03b8, \u03b8\u2032 in \u0398 and 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 dim \u0398. Integration over X shows that \u03c1//i (\u03b8) and \u03c1//j (\u03b8\u2032 ) commute.\nBy von Neumann's Theorem, there is an operator X and real-valued functions f1 , . . . , fdim\u0398 on\nR \u00d7 \u0398 such that\n\u03c1//i (\u03b8) = fi (X; \u03b8).\n(35)\nUsing condition (iii), and the fact that \u03c1//i and \u03c1//j commute, it follows from the Lemma that\n\u03c1//i/j = \u03c1//j/i . By condition (iv), (35) can be integrated to give a function F such that\n\u03c1//i (\u03b8) = F/i (X; \u03b8).\nThe result follows by uniqueness of solutions of differential equations.\nCorollary 1. If under the conditions of Theorem 4 there exists an unbiased estimator t of \u03b8\nbased on the measurement M achieving (19), then the model is a quantum exponential family of\nsymmetric type (15) with commuting Tr .\nVersions of these results have been known for some time; see Young (1975), Fujiwara and Nagaoka\n(1995), Amari and Nagaoka (2000); compare especially our Corollary 1 to Amari and Nagaoka\n(2000, Theorem 7.6), and our Theorem 4 to parts (I) to (IV) of the subsequent outlined proof in\nAmari and Nagaoka (2000). Unfortunately the precise regularity conditions and detailed proofs\nseem to be available only in some earlier publications in Japanese. Note that we have obtained the\nsame conclusions, by a different proof, in the spin-half pure state case, Example 12. This indicates\nthat a more general result is possible without the hypothesis of positivity of the state.\nThe symmetric logarithmic derivative is not the unique quantum analogue of the classical\nstatistical concept of score. Other analogues include the right, left and balanced derivatives\nobtained by suitable variants of (10). Each of these gives a quantum information inequality and\na quantum Cram\u00e9r\u2013Rao bound analogous to (31) and (19). See Belavkin (1976). There is no\ngeneral relationship between the various quantum information inequalities when the dimension of\n\u03b8 is greater than one.\nIn the next subsection we discuss the issue of asymptotic attainability of these and similar\nbounds.\n\n6.3\n\nAsymptotic Information Bounds\n\nIn classical statistics, the Cram\u00e9r\u2013Rao bound is attainable uniformly in the unknown parameter\nonly under rather special circumstances. On the other hand, the restriction to unbiased estimators\nis hardly made in practice and indeed is difficult to defend. However, we have a richly developed\nasymptotic theory which states that in large samples certain estimators (e.g., the maximum likelihood estimator) are approximately unbiased and approximately normally distributed with variance\nattaining the Cram\u00e9r\u2013Rao bound. Moreover, no estimator can do better, in various precise mathematical senses (the H\u00e1jek\u2013LeCam asymptotic local minimax theorem and convolution theorem, for\ninstance). Recent work by Gill and Massar (2000), surveyed in Gill (2001a), makes a first attempt\nto carry over these ideas to quantum statistics. Similar results have been obtained, interestingly,\nwith quite different methods, in a series of papers, by Young (1975), Fujiwara and Nagaoka (1995),\nHayashi (1997), and Hayashi (1998). Another very recent approach, using large deviation theory\nrather than central limit theory, is given by Keyl and Werner (2001). The aim of Gill and Massar\n(2000) was to answer a question first posed by Peres and Wootters (1991): do joint measurements on a product of identical quantum systems contain more information about the common\nstate of the subsystems, than separate measurements? The question was first answered-in the\naffirmative-in a rather specific form, by Massar and Popescu (1995): they considered for the most\npart just n = 2 copies of a spin-half pure state, in a Bayesian setting with a special loss function\nand prior distribution. Work of Barndorff-Nielsen and Gill (2000) showed that this advantage of\njoint over separate measurements disappears, for the spin-half pure state example, as n \u2192 \u221e.\nThe approach of Gill and Massar (2000) is firstly to delineate more precisely the class of attainable information matrices in (\u03b8; M ) based on arbitrary (or special classes) of measurements on\nthe model (28) of n identical particles each in the same state \u03c1(\u03b8). Next, using the van Trees\n28\n\n\finequality, a Bayesian version of the Cram\u00e9r\u2013Rao inequality, see Gill and Levit (1995), bounds\non in (\u03b8; M ) are converted into bounds on the asymptotic scaled mean quadratic error matrix of\nregular estimators of \u03b8. Thirdly, one constructs measurements and estimators which achieve those\nbounds asymptotically. The first step yields the following theorem.\nTheorem 5 (Gill\u2013Massar information bound). In the model (28), one has\ntr{I(\u03b8)\u22121 in (\u03b8; M )/n} \u2264 dim(H) \u2212 1\n\n(36)\n\nin any of the following cases: (i) dim(\u03b8) = 1 and dim(H) = 2, (ii) \u03c1 is a pure state, (iii) the\nmeasurement M is separable.\nCase (i) follows from the earlier information inequality (31) from which follows, without any\nfurther conditions, tr{I(\u03b8)\u22121 in (\u03b8; M )/n} \u2264 dim(\u03b8). The class of separable measurements, see Section 2.2, includes all multilocal instruments, i.e., instruments which are composed of a sequence of\ninstruments acting on separate particles, see Section 2.3. Thus it is allowed that the measurement\nmade on particle 2 depends on the outcome of the measurement on particle 1, and even that after\nthese two measurements, yet another measurement, depending on the results so far, is made on\nthe first particle in its new state, etc.\nIn the spin-half case the bound (36) is achievable in the sense that for any matrix K such that\ntr{I(\u03b8)\u22121 K} \u2264 1, there exists a measurement M on one particle, generally depending on \u03b8, such\nthat i(\u03b8; M ) = K. The measurement is a randomised choice of several simple measurements of\nspin, one spin direction for each component of \u03b8.\nApplication of the van Trees inequality gives the following asymptotic bound:\nTheorem 6 (Asymptotic information bound). In the model (28), let V (\u03b8) denote the limiting\nscaled mean quadratic error matrix of a regular sequence of estimators \u03b8bn based on a sequence of\nmeasurements Mn on n particles; i.e., V ij (\u03b8) = limn\u2192\u221e nE\u03b8 {(\u03b8bni \u2212 \u03b8i )(\u03b8bnj \u2212 \u03b8j )}. Then V satisfies\nthe inequality\ntr{I(\u03b8)\u22121 V (\u03b8)\u22121 } \u2264 dim(H) \u2212 1\n(37)\nin any of the following cases: (i) dim(\u03b8) = 1 and dim(H) = 2, (ii) \u03c1 is a pure state, (iii) the\nmeasurements Mn are separable.\nA regular estimator sequence is one for which the mean quadratic error matrices converge\nuniformly in \u03b8 to a continuous limit. It is also possible to give a version of the theorem in terms\nof convergence in distribution, H\u00e1jek-regularity and V the mean quadratic error matrix of the\nlimiting distribution, rather than the limit of the mean quadratic error.\nIn the spin-half case, this bound is also asymptically achievable, in the sense that for any\ncontinuous matrix function W (\u03b8) such that tr{I(\u03b8)\u22121 W (\u03b8)\u22121 } \u2264 1 there exists a sequence of\nseparable measurements Mn with asymptotic scaled mean quadratic error matrix equal to W . This\nresult is proved by consideration of a rather natural two-stage measurement procedure. Firstly, on\na small (asymptotically vanishing) proportion of the particles, carry out arbitrary measurements\ne Then on each of the\nallowing consistent estimation of \u03b8, resulting in a preliminary estimate \u03b8.\nf\nremaining particles, carry out the measurement M (on each separate particle) which is optimal in\neM\ne \u22121 . Estimate \u03b8 by maximum likelihood estimation, conditional\nf) = K = W (\u03b8)\nthe sense that i(\u03b8;\ne on the outcomes obtained in the second stage. For large n, since \u03b8e will then be\non the value of \u03b8,\nf will have Fisher information i(\u03b8; M\nf) close to that\nclose to the true value of \u03b8, the measurement M\nof the 'optimal' measurement on one particle with Fisher information i(\u03b8, M ) = W (\u03b8)\u22121 . By the\nusual properties of maximum likelihood estimators, it will therefore have scaled mean quadratic\nerror close to W (\u03b8). These measurements are not just separable, but multilocal, and within that\nclass, adaptive and sequential with each new subsystem being measured only once.\nIn the spin-half case we have therefore a complete asymptotic efficiency theory in any of the\nthree cases (i) a one-dimensional parameter, (ii) a pure state, (iii) separable measurements. By\n'complete' we mean that it is precisely known what is the set of all attainable limiting scaled mean\nquadratic error matrices. This collection is described in terms of the quantum information matrix\n29\n\n\ffor one particle. What is interesting is that when none of these three conditions hold, greater\nasymptotic precision is possible. For instance, Gill and Massar (2000) exhibit a measurement of\ntwo spin-half particles which, for a completely unknown mixed state (a three-parameter model),\nhas about 50% larger total Fisher information (for certain parameter values) than any separable\nmeasurement on two particles. Therefore if one has a large number n of particles, one has about\n25% better precision when using the maximum likelihood estimator applied to the outcomes of\nthis measurement on n/2 pairs of particles, than any separable measurement whatsoever on all n.\nIt is not known whether taking triples, quadruples, etc., allows even greater increases of precision.\nIt would be valuable to delineate precisely the set all attainable Fisher information matrices when\nnon-separable measurements are allowed on each number of particles.\nA similar instance of this phenomenon was called non-locality without entanglement by Bennett et al.\n(999a). One could say that though the n particles are not in an entangled state, one needs an 'entangled measurement', presumably brought about by bringing the particles into interaction with\none another (unitary evolution starting from the product state) before measurement, in order to\nextract maximal information about their state. The word 'non-locality' refers to the possibility\nthat the n particles could be widely separated and brought into interaction through other entangled particles; see Section 8 for further examples of this kind in the context of optimal information\ntransmission and in teleportation.\n\n7\n\nInfinite Dimensional Space\n\nSo far our examples have concerned spin-half systems, for which the dimension of the Hilbert\nspace H is 2, and occasionally spin-j systems (dimension 2j + 1). In this section we give a survey\nof an important infinite dimensional example. The finite dimensional cases led us to parametric\nquantum statistical models. If the system has an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space, non- and semiparametric quantum statistical models make an entrance. So far, they have been little studied\nfrom the point of view of modern mathematical statistics, despite their significance in experimental\nquantum physics, especially quantum optics.\n\n7.1\n\nHarmonic Oscillator\n\nIn this subsection we summarise some useful basic theory, and in the next we consider a basic\nstatistical problem.\nThe simple harmonic oscillator is the basic model for the motion of a quantum particle in a\nquadratic potential well on the real line. Precisely the same mathematical structure describes\noscillations of a single mode of an electromagnetic field (a single frequency in one direction in\nspace). A useful orthonormal basis in the latter situation is given by the state-vectors of the pure\nstates representing zero, one, two, . . . photons. We denote these state-vectors by |0i, |1i, |2i, . . ..\nThis basis is called the number basis. For the simple harmonic oscillator, the pure state with\nstate-vector |mi is P\na state of definitePenergy 1/2 + m units, m = 0, 1, 2, . . . . A pure state with\nstate-vector |\u03c8i =\ncm |mi, where\n|cm |2 = 1, is a complex superposition of these states. A\nmixed state \u03c1 is a probability mixture over pure states |\u03c8ih\u03c8| with state-vectors |\u03c8i.\nSome key operators in this context, together with their common names, are\n\u221a\nCreation\nA+ |ni = n + 1 |n + 1i\n\u221a\n\u2212\nA |ni = n |n \u2212 1i\nAnnihilation\nN |ni = n |ni\nNumber\n\u221a\n(38)\nPosition\nQ = (A\u2212 + A+ )/ 2\n\u221a\n1 \u2212\n(A \u2212 A+ )/ 2\ni\nX\u03c6 = (cos \u03c6) Q + (sin \u03c6) P\nP =\n\n30\n\nMomentum\nQuadrature at phase \u03c6 .\n\n\fOne should observe that\nN = A+ A\u2212 = A\u2212 A+ \u2212 1 =\n\n1 2\n(Q + P 2 \u2212 1)\n2\n\n(39)\n\n[Q, P ] = i1 .\nIn the simple quantum harmonic oscillator, the state of a particle evolves under the Hamiltonian H = 21 (Q2 +P 2 ) = N + 12 1; thus the state-vector of a pure state satisfies |\u03c8(t)i = e\u2212iHt |\u03c8(0)i,\nand an arbitrary state evolves as \u03c1(t) = e\u2212iHt \u03c1(0)eiHt . The operators Q and P correspond to\nthe position (on the real line) and the momentum of the particle. Indeed, the spectral decompositions of these two operators yield the PProM's of measurements of position and momentum\nrespectively. It turns out that for a complex number z = rei\u03c6 and the corresponding operator\n(called the Weyl operator ) Wz = exp(irX\u03c6 ), we have ei\u03b8N Wz e\u2212i\u03b8N = Wei\u03b8 z , or in terms of the\noperator X\u03c6 , ei\u03b8N eitX\u03c6 e\u2212i\u03b8N = eitX\u03c6+\u03b8 . These relations become especially powerful when we note\na short cut to the computation of the probability distribution of the measurement of the PProM\ncorresponding to an observable X: it is the probability distribution with characteristic function\ntr{\u03c1eitX }. Combining these facts, we see that the distribution of the outcome of a measurement\nof position Q on the particle at time t is the same as that of Xt at time 0. In particular, with\nt = \u03c0/2, measuring P at time 0 has the same distribution as measuring Q at time \u03c0/2. For future\nreference, define F = e\u2212i(\u03c0/2)N and note the relation F P = QF .\nWe mention for later reference that the Weyl operators form a projective unitary representation\nof the translation group on the real plane, since these are unitary operators with Wz Wz\u2032 =\nw(z, z \u2032 )Wz+z\u2032 for a certain complex function w of modulus 1, cf. (23).\nIn order to derive the probability distributions of outcomes of measurements of the observables\ndefined above, it is useful to consider a particular concrete representation of the abstract Hilbert\nspace H as L2C (R), that is, the space of complex-valued, Borel measurable, square integrable functions on the real line. The basis vectors |ni will be represented by normalised Hermite polynomials\ntimes the square root of the normal density with mean zero and variance half. The observables Q\nand P become rather easy to describe in this representation. At the same time, algebraic results\nfrom the theory of representations of groups provide further relations between the observables X\u03c6 ,\nN , Q and P .\nLet us define the Hermite polynomials Hn (x), n = 0, 1, 2 . . . , by\ndn \u2212x2\ne\n.\n(40)\ndxn\nIt follows that Hn (x) is an n'th order polynomial with leading term (2x)n . These polynomials\ncan also be defined starting from the simple polynomials (2x)n , n = 0, 1, 2, . . . by Gram\u2013Schmidt\northogonalisation\nwith respect to the normal density with mean 0 and variance 1/2, n(x) =\n\u221a\n(1/ \u03c0) exp(\u2212x2 ). Now if X is normal with mean zero and variance half, then E(Hn (X)2 ) = 2n n!.\nNormalising, we obtain the following orthonormal sequence un in the space L2C (R):\nr\nn(x)\nun (x) =\nHn (x) .\n(41)\n2n n!\nThis sequence is not only orthonormal but complete-it forms a basis of L2C (R). The functions un\nsatisfy the following recursion relations\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u221a\n2 xun (x) = n + 1 un+1 (x) + n un\u22121 (x)\n\u221a \u221a\nd\nun (x) = 2 n un\u22121 (x) \u2212 xun (x) .\ndx\nThis shows us that under the equivalence defined by |ni \u2190\u2192 un , one has the following correspondences\n\u221a\nQ = (A\u2212 + A+ )/ 2 \u2190\u2192 x\n\u221a\n1\n1 d\nP = (A\u2212 \u2212 A+ )/ 2 \u2190\u2192\n(42)\ni\ni dx\n\u0010\n2 \u0011\nd\n2N + 1 = Q2 + P 2 \u2190\u2192 x2 \u2212 2 ,\ndx\n2\n\nHn (x) = ex (\u22121)n\n\n31\n\n\fwhere, on the first line, by 'x' we mean the operator of multiplication of a function of x by x to\nobtain a new function. In this representation the operator Q has 'diagonal' form, corresponding\nto the PProM with element \u03a0(B), B a Borel set of the real line, being the operator 'multiply by\nthe indicator function 1B '. Thus for a pure state with state-vector |\u03c8i in H represented by the\nwave-function x 7\u2192 \u03c8(x)\nin L2C (R), the probability that a measurement of Q takes a value in B is\nR\n2\nequal to k1B \u03c8k = B |\u03c8(x)|2 dx, so that the outcome of the measurement has probability density\n|\u03c8(x)|2 . Moreover,\nZ \u221e\n1\n\u221a\ne\u2212itx un (x)dx = (\u2212i)n un (t) .\n(43)\n2\u03c0 \u2212\u221e\nBy expanding an arbitrary wave function \u03c8 as a series of coefficients times un , one sees from this\nthat the operator F = e\u2212i(\u03c0/2)N = (\u2212i)N is nothing else than the Fourier transform, and its\nadjoint F \u2217 is the inverse Fourier transform. The relation F P = QF between Q and P involving\nF tells us that the probability distribution of a measurement of momentum P on a particle in\nthe pure state with state-vector |\u03c8i has density equal to the absolute value of the square of the\nFourier transform of the wave function \u03c8(x). Measurement of Q is further studied in Example\n14in Appendix A.1.\nMore generally, for the observable X\u03c6 and considering mixed states instead of pure, from\nei\u03c6N eitQ e\u2212i\u03c6N = eitX\u03c6 one may derive the following expression for the probability density of a\nmeasurement of X\u03c6 on a system in state \u03c1:\nXX\n\u2032\np\u03c1 (x; \u03c6) =\n(44)\n\u03c1m,m\u2032 ei(m\u2212m )\u03c6 um (x)um\u2032 (x) ,\nm\n\nm\u2032\n\nwhere \u03c1m,m\u2032 = hm|\u03c1|m\u2032 i. The sense in which this double infinite sum converges is rather delicate;\nhowever, if only finitely many matrix elements \u03c1m,m\u2032 are non-zero, the formula makes sense as it\nstands.\n\n7.2\n\nQuantum Tomography\n\nIn this subsection we discuss a statistical problem, called for historical reasons quantum tomography, concerning the observables introduced in the previous subsection. Some key references\nare the book Leonhardt (1997) and the survey papers D'Ariano (997a,b), though there has been\nmuch further progress since then. In its simplest form, the problem of quantum tomography\nis: given independent observations of measurements of the quadrature at phase \u03c6, X\u03c6 , with \u03c6\ndrawn repeatedly at random from the uniform distribution on [0, 2\u03c0], reconstruct the state \u03c1. In\nstatistical terms, we wish to do nonparametric estimation of \u03c1 from n independent and identically distributed observations (\u03c6i , xi ), with \u03c6i as just described and xi from the density (44) with\n\u03c6 = \u03c6i . In quantum optics, measuring a single mode of an electromagnetic field in what is called a\nquantum homodyne experiment, this would be the appropriate model with perfect photodetectors.\nIn practice, independent Gaussian noise should be added.\nRecalling that the probability density of a measurement of X\u03c6 has tr{\u03c1eit(cos \u03c6Q+sin \u03c6P ) } as\nits characteristic function, we note that if Q and P were actually commuting operators (they are\nnot!) then the joint characteristic function of a measurement of the two simultaneously would\nhave been the function tr{\u03c1ei(sQ+tP ) } of the two variables (s, t).\nNow the latter may not be the bivariate characteristic function of a joint probability density,\nbut it is the characteristic function of a certain function called the Wigner function. This function\nW\u03c1 (q, p) is known to characterise \u03c1. It is a real-valued function, integrating to 1 over the whole\nplane, but generally taking negative as well as positive values. The relation between the characteristic function of a measurement of X\u03c6 and the characteristic function of the Wigner function\nwhich we have just described, shows that the probability density of a measurement of X\u03c6 can be\ncomputed from the Wigner function by treating it as a joint probability density of two random\ne Pe and computing from this density the marginal density of the linear combination\nvariables Q,\ne\ncos \u03c6 Q + sin \u03c6 Pe. Now this computation is nothing else than a computation of the Radon transform of W\u03c1 (q, p): its projection onto the line (cos \u03c6)q + (sin \u03c6)p = 0. This transform is well known\n32\n\n\ffrom computer-aided tomography, when for instance the data from which an X-ray image must\nbe computed is the collection of one-dimensional images obtained by projecting onto all possible\ndirections. Thus from the collection of all densities p\u03c1 (x; \u03c6) of measurements of X\u03c6 , one could\nin principle compute the Wigner function W\u03c1 (q, p) by inverse Radon transform, from which one\ncan compute other representations of \u03c1 by further appropriate transformations. In particular, a\ndouble infinite integral over (p, q) of the product of the Wigner function with an appropriate kernel\nresults in \u03c1 in the 'position' representation, i.e., as the kernel of an integral transform mapping\nL2 into L2 . Not all states can be so represented, but at least all can be approximated in this\nway. A further double infinite integral over (x, x\u2032 ) of another kernel results in \u03c1 in the 'number'\nrepresentation, i.e., the elements \u03c1m,m\u2032 .\nThe basic idea of quantum tomography is to carry out this sequence of mathematical transformations on an empirical version of the density p\u03c1 (x; \u03c6) obtained by some combination of\nsmoothing and binning of the observations (\u03c6i , xi ). This theoretical possibility was discovered\nby Vogel and Risken (1989), and first carried out experimentally by M.G. Raymer and colleagues\nin path-breaking experiments in the early 1990's, see Smithey et al. (1993). Despite the enthusiasm with which the initial results were received, the method has a large number of drawbacks.\nTo begin with, it depends on some choices of smoothing parameters and/or binning intervals,\nand later, during the succession of integral transforms, on truncations of infinite integrals among\nother numerical approximations. It has been discovered that these 'smoothings' tend to destroy\nprecisely the interesting 'quantum' features of the functions being reconstructed. The final result suffers from both bias and variance, neither of which can be evaluated easily. Inverting the\nRadon transform is an ill-posed inverse problem and the whole procedure needs massive numbers\nof observations before it works reasonably well.\nIn the mid 1990's G.M. D'Ariano and his coworkers in Pavia have discovered a fascinating\nmethod to short-cut this approach, see D'Ariano (997a,b). Using the fact that that the Weyl\noperators introduced above form an irreducible projective representation of the translation group\non R2 , they derived an elegant 'tomographic formula' expressing the mean of any operator A (not\nnecessarily self-adjoint), i.e., tr(\u03c1A), as the integral of a function (depending on the choice of A)\nof x and \u03c6, multiplied by p\u03c1 (x; \u03c6), with respect to Lebesgue measure on R \u00d7 [0, 2\u03c0]. In particular,\nif we take the operator A to be |m\u2032 ihm| for given (m, m\u2032 ), we have hereby expressed \u03c1m,m\u2032 as the\nmean value of a certain function, indexed by (m, m\u2032 ), of the observations (\u03c6i , xi ), as long as the\nphases \u03c6i are chosen uniformly at random.\nThe key relation of their approach is the identity\nZ\n(45)\nA = \u03c0 \u22121\ntr(AWz )Wz dz ,\nC\n\nwhich can be derived (and generalised) with the theory of group representations. From this follows\nZ\n(46)\ntr(\u03c1A) = \u03c0 \u22121\ntr(AWz )tr(\u03c1Wz )dz .\nC\n\nThe left hand side is the mean value of interest. The first 'trace' on the right hand side is a\nknown function of the operator of interest A and the variable z. In the second 'trace' on the right\nhand side, after expressing z = rei\u03c6 in polar coordinates, we recognise the characteristic function\nevaluated at the argument r of the probability density of our observations p\u03c1 (x; \u03c6). Writing the\ncharacteristic function as the integral over x of eirx times this density, transforming the integral\nover z into integrals over r and \u03c6, and reordering the three resulting integrals, we can rewrite the\nright hand side as\n\u0015\nZ \u221e Z 2\u03c0 \u0014Z \u221e\nKA (r, x, \u03c6)dr p\u03c1 (x; \u03c6)dxd\u03c6/(2\u03c0).\nx=\u2212\u221e\n\n\u03c6=0\n\nr=0\n\nThe innermost integral can sometimes be evaluated analytically, otherwise numerically; but in\neither case we have succeeded in our aim of rewriting means of operators of interest as means of\nknown kernel functions of our observations. In the case A = |m\u2032 ihm|, of interest for reconstructing\n33\n\n\f\u03c1m,m\u2032 , the kernel turns out to be bounded and hence we obtain unbiased estimators of the \u03c1m,m\u2032\nwith variance equal to 1/n times some bounded quantities.\nStill this approach has its drawbacks. The required kernel function, in the case of reconstructing\nthe density in the number representation, is highly oscillatory and even though everything is\nbounded, still huge numbers of observations are needed to get informative estimates. Also, the\nunbiased estimators constructed in this way are not unique and one may wonder whether better\nchoices of kernels can be found. However, the approach does open a window of opportunity for\nfurther mathematical study of the mapping from p\u03c1 (x; \u03c6) to \u03c1m,m\u2032 which could be a vital tool for\ndeveloping the most recent approach, which we now outline briefly.\nAs we made clear, the statistical estimation problem seems related to the problems of nonparametric curve estimation, or more precisely, estimation of a parameter lying in an infinite\ndimensional space. Modern experience with such problems has developed an arsenal of methods,\nof which penalised and sieved likelihood, and nonparametric Bayesian methods, hold much promise\nas 'universal' approaches leading to optimal methods. In the present context, sieved maximum\nlikelihood is very natural, since truncation of the Hilbert space in the number basis leads to finite\ndimensional parametric models which can in principle be tackled by maximum likelihood. One\ncan hope that, from a study of the balance between truncation error (bias) and variance, it would\nbe possible to derive data-driven methods to estimate \u03c1 optimally with respect to a user-specified\nloss function. So far, only the initial steps in this research programme have been taken; in recent work Banaszek et al. (2000) and Paris et al. (2001) have shown that maximum likelihood\nestimation of the parameters in the density (44) is numerically feasible, after the number basis\n{|mi : m = 0, 1, . . . } is truncated at (e.g.) m = 15 or m = 20. This means estimation of about\n400 real parameters constrained to produce a density matrix. Numerical optimisation was used\nafter a reparameterisation by writing \u03c1 = T T \u2217 as the product of an upper-triangular matrix and\nits adjoint, so that only one constraint (trace 1) needs to be incorporated. We think that it is a\nmajor open problem to work out the asymptotic theory of this method, taking account of datadriven truncation, and possibly alleviating the problem of such a large parameter-space by using\nBayesian methods. The method should be tuned to the estimation of various functionals of \u03c1 of\ninterest, and should provide standard errors or confidence intervals.\nThe quantum statistical model introduced above is that of optical homodyne measurements.\nThere is also an elegant mathematical model for another experimental set-up called heterodyne\nmeasurement. In this case the measurement is a generalised measurement or OProM, and it can\nbe realised by taking the product of the Hilbert space of the system of interest with another\ninfinite dimensional system, in its ground state. Write Q\u2032 , P \u2032 for the position and momentum\noperators on the ancillary system. It turns out that P + P \u2032 and Q \u2212 Q\u2032 commute, and therefore\ncould in principle be measured simultaneously. A joint measurement of the two is a realisation of\na heterodyne measurement. As an OProM it is invariant under the rotation group (corresponding\nto the phase changes \u03c6 of the homodyne measurement) and under a certain parametric model\nfor the state, called the Gaussian or coherent state of the harmonic oscillator, possesses some\ndecision-theoretic optimality properties because of this, see Holevo (1982). The pair now form a\nquantum transformation model in the sense of Section 4.2.\nThe field of quantum tomography is rapidly developing, with some of the latest (not yet\npublished) results from the Pavia group of G.M. d'Ariano being quantum holographic methods\nto estimate not an unknown state, but an unknown transformation of a state (i.e., a completely\npositive instrument with trivial outcome space).\n\n8\n\nFrom Quantum Probability to Quantum Statistics\n\nA recurring theme in this section is the relation between classical and quantum probability and\nstatistics. This has been a matter of heated controversy ever since the discovery of quantum\nmechanics. It has mathematical, physical, and philosophical ingredients and much confusion,\nif not controversy, has been generated by problems of interdisciplinary communication between\nmathematicians, physicists, philosophers and more recently statisticians. Authorities from both\n34\n\n\fphysics and mathematics, perhaps starting with Feynman (1951), have promoted vigorously the\nstandpoint that 'quantum probability' is something very different from 'classical probability'. Most\nrecently, in two papers on Bell's inequality (which we discuss in Section 8.2) Accardi and Regoli\n(2000a,b), state \"the real origin of the Bell's inequality is the assumption of the applicability\nof classical (Kolmogorovian) probability to quantum mechanics\" which can only be interpreted\nas a categorical statement that classical probability is not applicable to quantum mechanics.\nMalley and Hornstein (1993) conclude from the perceived conflict between classical and quantum\nprobability that 'quantum statistics' should be set apart from classical statistics.\nWe disagree. In our opinion, though fascinating mathematical facts and physical phenomena\nlie at the root of these statements, cultural preconceptions have also played a role. Statistical\nproblems from quantum mechanics fall definitely in the framework of classical statistics and the\nclaimed distinctions have retarded the adoption of statistical science in physics. The phenomenon\nof quantum entanglement in fact has far-reaching technological implications, which are easy to\ngrasp in terms of classical probability; their development will surely involve statistics too.\nIn the first subsection we discuss, from a mathematical point of view, the distinction between\nclassical and quantum probability. Next, we consider physical implications of the probabilistic\npredictions of quantum mechanics through the celebrated example of the Bell (1964) inequalities\nand the Aspect et al. (1982a,b) experiment. We appraise the 'classical versus quantum' question\nin the light of those implications. Finally we review a number of controversial issues in the\nfoundations of quantum physics (locality, realism, the measurement problem) and sketch the basics\nof quantum teleportation, emphasizing that emerging quantum technology (entanglement-assisted\ncommunication, quantum computation, quantum holography and tomography of instruments)\naims to capitalise on precisely those features of quantum mechanics which in the past have often\nbeen seen as paradoxical theoretical nuisances.\n\n8.1\n\nClassical versus Quantum Probability\n\nOur stance is that the predictions which quantum mechanics makes of the real world are stochastic in nature. A quantum physical model of a particular phenomenon allows one to compute\nprobabilities of all possible outcomes of all possible measurements of the quantum system. The\nword 'probability' means here: relative frequency in many independent repetitions. The word\n'measurement' is meant in the broad sense of: macroscopic results of interactions of the quantum\nsystem under study with the outside world. These predictions depend on a summary of the state\nof the quantum system. The word 'state' might suggest some fundamental property of a particular collection of particles, but for our purposes all we need to understand under the word is: a\nconvenient mathematical encapsulation of the information needed to make any such predictions.\nSome physicists argue that it is meaningless to talk of the state of a particular particle, one can\nonly talk of the state of a large collection of particles prepared in identical circumstances; this is\ncalled a statistical ensemble. Others take the point of view that when one talks about the state of\na particular quantum system one is really talking about a property of the mechanism which generated that system. Given that quantum mechanics predicts only probabilities, as far as real-world\npredictions are concerned the distinction between on the one hand a property of an ensemble of\nparticles or of a procedure to prepare particles, and on the other hand a property of one particular\nparticle, is a matter of semantics. However, if one would like to understand quantum mechanics\nby somehow finding a more classical (intuitive) physical theory in the background which would explain the observed phenomena, this becomes an important issue. It is also an issue for cosmology,\nwhen there is only one closed quantum system under study: the universe.\nIt follows from our standpoint that 'quantum statistics' is, for us, classical statistical inference\nabout unknown parameters in models for data arising from measurements on a quantum system.\nHowever, just as in biostatistics, geostatistics, etc., etc., many of these statistical problems have\na common structure and it pays to study the core ideas and common features in detail. As we\nhave seen, this leads to the introduction of mathematical objects such as quantum score, quantum\nexpected information, quantum exponential family, quantum transformation model, and so on;\nthe names are deliberately chosen because of analogy and connections with the existing notions\n35\n\n\ffrom classical statistics.\nAlready at the level of probability (i.e., before statistical considerations arise) one can see\nanalogies between the mathematics of quantum states and observables on the one hand, and classical probability measures and random variables on the other. This analogy is very strong and\nindeed mathematically very fruitful (also very fruitful for mathematical physics). Note that collections of both random variables and operators can be endowed with algebraic structure (sums,\nproducts, . . . ). It is a fact that from an abstract point of view a basic structure in probability\ntheory-a collection of random\nvariables X on a countably generated probability space, together\nR\nwith their expectations XdP under a given probability measure P -can be represented by a\n(commuting) subset of the set of self-adjoint operators Q on a separable Hilbert space together\nwith the expectations tr{\u03c1Q} computed using the trace rule under a given state \u03c1. Thus: a basic structure in classical probability theory is isomorphic to a special case of a basic structure\nin quantum probability. 'Quantum probability', or 'noncommutative probability theory' is the\nname of the branch of mathematics which studies the mathematical structure of states and observables in quantum mechanics. From this mathematical point of view, one may justly claim that\nclassical probability is a special case of quantum probability. The claim does entail, however, a\nrather narrow view of classical probability. Moreover, many probabilists will feel that abandoning\ncommutativity is throwing away the baby with the bathwater, since this broader mathematical\nstructure has no analogue of the sample outcome \u03c9, and hence no opportunity for a probabilist's\nbeloved probabilistic arguments. We discuss Quantum Probability further in Section 9.1 under\nthe heading of Quantum Stochastic Processes.\n\n8.2\n\nBell, Aspect, et al.\n\nWe now discuss some physical predictions of quantum mechanics of a most striking 'nonclassical'\nnature. Many authors have taken this as a defect of classical probability theory and there have been\nproposals to abandon classical probability in favour of alternative theories (negative, complex or padic probabilities; nonmeasurable events; noncommutative probability; . . . ) in order to 'resolve the\nparadox'. However in our opinion, the phenomena are real and the defect, if any, lies in believing\nthat quantum phenomena do not contradict classical physical thinking. This opinion is supported\nby the recent development of (potential) technology which acknowledges the extraordinary nature\nof the predictions and exploits the discovered phenomena (teleportation, entanglement-assisted\ncommunication, and so on). In other words, one should not try to explain away the strange\nfeatures of quantum mechanics as some kind of defect of classical probabilistic thinking, but one\nshould use classical probabilistic thinking to pinpoint these features.\nConsider two spin-half particles, for which the customary state space is H = C2 \u2297 C2 . Let |0i\nand |1i denote the orthonormal basis of C2 corresponding to 'spin up' and 'spin down', thus two\neigenvectors of the Pauli spin matrix \u03c3z . We write |iji as an abbreviation for |ii \u2297 |ji, defining\nfour elements of an orthonormal basis of our H.\nFor ~u in S 2 , let \u03c3u~ = ux \u03c3x + uy \u03c3y + uz \u03c3z , the observable 'spin in the direction ~u' for one spinhalf particle. It has eigenvalues \u00b11 and its eigenvectors are the state-vectors \u03c8(\u00b1~u) corresponding\nto the directions \u00b1~u in S 2 . The appropriate model for measurement of spin in direction ~u on the\nfirst particle and spin in the direction ~v on the second particle is a joint simple measurement of\nthe two compatible observables \u03c3u~ \u2297 1 and 1 \u2297 \u03c3~v (see Example 6). The possible outcomes \u00b11, \u00b11\ncorrespond to the one-dimensional subspaces spanned by the four orthogonal vectors \u03c8(\u00b1~u) \u2297\n\u03c8(\u00b1~v ).\nNow if the state of the system is a tensor product \u03c11 \u2297 \u03c12 of separate states of each particle,\nthen one can directly show that the outcomes for particle 1 and particle 2 are independent,\nand distributed as separate measurements on the separate particles, as one would hope. If the\njoint state is a mixture of product states, then the outcomes will be distributed as a mixture of\nindependent outcomes. For an entangled state, the outcomes can be even\n\u221a more heavily dependent.\nConsider the entangled pure state with state vector {|10i \u2212 |01i}/ 2. This state is often called\nthe singlet or Bell state. Straightforward calculations, see for instance Barndorff-Nielsen et al.\n(2002), show that for this state the two spin measurements have the following joint distribution:\n36\n\n\fthe marginal distribution of each spin measurement is Bernoulli( 21 ), the probability that the two\noutcomes are equal (both +1 or both \u22121) is 12 (1 \u2212 ~u * ~v ). In particular, if the two measurements\nare taken in the same direction, then the two outcomes are different with probability 1; in the\nopposite direction, the two outcomes are always the same; in orthogonal directions the probability\nof equality is 21 so, taking account of the marginal distributions, the two outcomes are independent.\nThe singlet state is an appropriate description for the spins of two spin-half particles produced\nsimultaneously in some nuclear scattering or decay processes where a total spin of 0 is conserved.\nThe two particles have exactly opposite spin, which seems reasonable. The two particles are\ntogether in a pure state, which is also reasonable if the process involved was a Schr\u00f6dinger evolution\nstarting from a pure state. The model also exhibits a rotational invariance. These are all good\nreasons to expect the model to be not just a hypothetical possibility but a real possibility (and\nindeed, it is).\nFix a special choice of two possible different values of ~u and two possible different values of ~v .\nLet us suppose that all four directions are in the same great circle on S 2 and let ~u1 and ~u2 be in\nthe directions 0\u25e6 and 120\u25e6 , let ~v1 and ~v2 be in the directions 180\u25e6 and 60\u25e6 . Since cos(60\u25e6 ) = 12 we\nsee that: when the directions are the pair (0\u25e6 , 180\u25e6 ) then the probability the two spins are found\nto be equal is 1; but when the directions are any of the three pairs (0\u25e6 , 60\u25e6 ) or (120\u25e6 , 180\u25e6 ) or\n(120\u25e6 , 60\u25e6 ) the two spins are found to be equal with probability 41 . Is this surprising?\nConsider an experiment where pairs of particles are generated in the singlet state, and then\nmade to travel to two far-apart locations, at each of which spin is measured in one of the two\ndirections just specified. Suppose the experiment is repeated many times, with random and\nindependent choice of the two directions for measurement at each of the two locations. We have just\ncomputed the probabilities of all possible outcomes under each of the four possible combinations\nof directions.\nLet us try to simulate the predicted statistics of the experiment using classical objects. To\nbe very concrete, consider two people who try to simulate two spin-half particles. They start in\na room together but then leave by different doors. Outside the room they are separately told a\ndirection, ~u1 or ~u2 for person 1, ~v1 or ~v2 for person 2, and asked to choose an outcome '+1' or\n'\u22121'. They are not allowed to communicate any more once they have left the room. Moreover\nthe directions will be chosen independently and randomly. The whole procedure will be repeated\nmany many times and their aim is to simulate the quantum probabilities stated above. The two\npersons obviously will need randomisation in order to imitate the randomness of spin-half particles.\nWe allow them to toss dice or coins, in any way they like, and to do this together in the room\nbefore leaving. They can simulate in this way any degree of dependence or independence they\nlike. Let us call the outcome of their randomisation process \u03c9. Their strategy will then be two\npairs of functions of \u03c9, with values \u00b11, which determine the answers each person would give when\nconfronted with each of his two directions on leaving the room, when the randomisation produces\nthe outcome \u03c9.\nThis whole set-up defines four Bernoulli \u00b11-valued random variables, let us call them X1 ,\nX2 , Y1 , Y2 ; the X variables for person 1 and the Y variables for person 2. The four must be\nsuch that any pair Xi , Yj has the same joint distribution as the result of measuring spins in the\ndirections ~ui and ~vj . Now it is easy to check that since these four variables are binary, X1 6= Y2\nand Y2 6= X2 and X2 6= Y1 implies X1 6= Y1 (just fill in +1, \u22121, +1, \u22121 for X1 , Y2 , X2 , Y1 in order;\nor alternatively \u22121, +1, \u22121, +1.) Conversely, therefore, X1 = Y1 implies X1 = Y2 or Y2 = X2 or\nX2 = Y1 . Therefore we have\nP(X1 = Y1 ) \u2264 P(X1 = Y2 ) + P(Y2 = X2 ) + P(X2 = Y1 ).\nBut the four probabilities we are trying to simulate are 1, 14 , 41 , 14 and it is not true that 1 \u2264\n1\n1\n1\n4 + 4 + 4 . Therefore it is not possible to simulate with classical means (people or computers or\nother classical physical systems) the predicted outcomes of measurements of two spin-half particles!\nThe inequality we have just derived is due to Bell (1964) who contrasted it with the prediction of quantum mechanics in order to prove the failure, a priori, of any attempt through\nthe introduction of hidden variables to explain the randomness of outcomes of measurements of\n37\n\n\fquantum systems through 'mere statistical variation' in not directly observed and uncontrollable\n(hence hidden) properties of the quantum systems or measurement devices. He assumed that any\nphysically meaningful hidden variables model would satisfy the physically reasonable property\nof locality, that is to say, the outcome of a measurement on one particle in one location should\nnot depend on the measurement being carried out simultanously on the other particle in another\ndistant location. Inspection of the argument we have given shows that Bell's inequality is not\ndue to our slavish adherence to classical probability, but simply through the assumption that the\noutcome of a measurement on one particle should not depend on which measurement is being made\non the other particle. This is reason enough for some authors, for instance Maudlin (1994), to\nconclude that Bell's argument shows that the predictions of quantum mechanics violate locality;\nhe goes on to study the possible conflicts with relativity theory and concludes that there is no\nconflict in the sense that this phenomenon does not violate the requirements that cause and effect\nshould not spread faster than the speed of light, and there is not a conflict with the basic relativistic (Minkowski) invariance property. Thus quantum mechanics lives in uneasy but peaceful\ncoexistence with relativity theory.\nAll this would be purely academic were it not the case that the model we have just described\ntruly is appropriate in certain physical situations and the predictions of quantum theory have\nbeen experimentally verified; first by Alain Aspect and his coworkers in a celebrated experiment\n(reported in Aspect et al. 1982a,b) in Orsay, Paris, where polarisation of pairs of entangled photons\nemitted from an excited caesium atom was measured with polarisation filters several metres apart;\nthe orientation of the filters being fixed independently and randomly after the photons had been\nemitted from the source and before they arrived at the polarisation filter. (Polarisation of photons\nhas a very similar mathematical description to spin of spin-half particles, except that all angles\nneed to be halved: entangled photons have equal behaviour at polarisation filters oriented 90\u25e6 to\none another.) More recently, the experiment has been done on the glass fibre network of Swiss\ntelecom with the two filters being 10 km apart on different shores of Lake Geneva.\nOur conclusion is that quantum mechanics makes extraordinary physical predictions, predictions which are properly stated and interpreted in the language of classical probability. Technological implications of these predictions are only just beginning to be explored. One proposal is\nentanglement-assisted communication, see Bennett et al. (999b, 2001); Holevo (2001b). Suppose A\nwould like to send a message to B by encoding the message in the states of a sequence of spin-half\nparticles transmitted one by one from A to B. At the receiving end B carries out measurements\non the received particles on the basis of which he infers the message. Obviously the results will\nbe random, especially if the communication channel suffers from noise, of classical or quantum\nnature. Using the theory of instruments one can describe mathematically all physically possible\ncommunication channels and all physically possible decoding (measurement) schemes, and compute analogously to classical information theory the maximum rate of transmission of information\nthrough the channel. Suppose now A and B allow themselves a further resource for communication. In between A and B a third person C is located, and he sends A and B simultaneously pairs\nof entangled spin half particles, in step with the transmission of particles from A to B. 'Obviously'\nthere is no way these particles can be used to transmit information from A to B. They come from\na different source altogether and are created in a fixed and known state. Yet it turns out that if\nA uses one part of the entangled pair in his encoding step with each particle he transmits, and B\nuses the other part of the pair in his decoding step, the rate of transmission can be doubled.\nThese extraordinary results show that it would be foolish to 'explain away' the phenomenon\ndiscovered by Bell by turning to some exotic probability theory (though many authors have done\nprecisely this!). On the contrary, the mathematics-using classical probability-shows that strange\nthings are going on and indeed it seems likely that one will be able to harness them in future\ntechnology.\n\n8.3\n\nTeleportation\n\nAs an example we show how the singlet state of a pair of spin-half particles, supposed to be\nin two distant locations, can be used to transmit a third spin-half state from one location to\n38\n\n\fthe other. This scheme was invented by Bennett et al. (1993) and experimentally carried out by\nA. Zeilinger's group in Innsbruck, see Bouwmeester et al. (1997). For a recent survey including\nreferences to the results of other experimental groups see Bouwmeester et al. (2001). The method\nillustrates how quantum technology (e.g., computation) will combine the basic ingredients of simple\nmeasurements, unitary evolution, and entanglement (product systems). The state being teleported\nis supposed to be completely unknown. This means that any attempt to measure it, and then\nteleport it by communicating in a classical way the results of measurement, cannot succeed, since\nthe outcomes will be random, do not determine the initial state, and the initial state will have\nbeen destroyed by the measurement. The no-cloning theorem of Wootters and Zurek (1982), Dieks\n(1982) shows that there is no instrument which can transform a state \u03c1 together with an ancillary\nquantum system into two identical copies \u03c1 \u2297 \u03c1.\nConsider a single spin-half particle in the pure state with state-vector \u03b1|1i + \u03b2|0i. It is brought\ninto interaction with a pair of particles in the singlet state so that the whole system is in \u221a\nthe\npure state with state-vector, after multiplication of the tensor product, and up to a factor 1/ 2,\n\u03b1|110i \u2212 \u03b1|101i + \u03b2|010i \u2212 \u03b2|001i. The three particles are here written in the sequence: particle\nto be teleported, first entangled particle at the source location, second entangled particle at the\ndestination location. Now we introduce the following four orthogonal\n\u221a state-vectors for the two\nparticles at the source location, neglecting another constant factor 1/ 2, \u03a61 = |10i \u2212 |01i, \u03a62 =\n|10i + |01i, \u03a81 = |11i + |00i, \u03a82 = |11i \u2212 |00i, and we note that our three particles together\n\u221a\nare in a pure state with state-vector which may be written (up to yet another factor, 1/ 4)\n\u03a81 \u2297 (\u03b1|0i \u2212 \u03b2|1i) + \u03a82 \u2297 (\u03b1|0i + \u03b2|1i) + \u03a61 \u2297 (\u2212\u03b1|1i \u2212 \u03b2|0i) + \u03a62 \u2297 (\u2212\u03b1|1i + \u03b2|0i). So far\nnothing has happened at all: we have simply rewritten the state-vector of the three particles as a\nsuperposition of four state-vectors, each lying in one of four orthogonal two-dimensional subspaces\nof C2 \u2297 C2 \u2297 C2 : namely the subspaces \u03a61 \u2297 C2 , \u03a62 \u2297 C2 , \u03a81 \u2297 C2 and \u03a82 \u2297 C2 .\nTo these four subspaces corresponds a simple instrument. It only involves the two particles\nat the source location and hence may be carried out by the person at that location. He obtains\none of four different outcomes, each with probability 41 , so he learns nothing about the particle\nto be teleported. However, conditional on the outcome of his measurement, the particle at the\ndestination is in one of the four pure states with state-vectors \u03b1|0i\u2212\u03b2|1i, \u03b1|0i+\u03b2|1i, \u2212\u03b1|1i\u2212\u03b2|0i,\n\u2212\u03b1|1i + \u03b2|0i. The mixture with equal probabilities of these four states is the completely mixed\nstate \u03c1 = 21 1, so nothing has happened at the destination: the state of the second part of the\nentangled pair still is in its original (marginal) state. But once the outcome of the measurement\nat the source is transmitted to the destination (two bits of information, transmitted by classical\nmeans), the receiver is able by means of one of four unitary transformations to transform the\nresulting pure state into the state with state-vector \u03b1|0i + \u03b2|1i: teleportation is succesful. Neither\nsource nor destination learn anything at all about the particle being transmitted by this procedure.\nIf the state being teleported was a mixture, then decomposing it into pure components which are\nteleported independently and perfectly shows that the final destination state is the same mixture.\nIn short, by transmitting two classical bits of information we are able to copy a point in the unit\nball (specified by three real numbers) from A to B, without learning anything about the point at\nall in the process.\n\n8.4\n\nThe Measurement Problem\n\nWe summarise here the problem raised by Schr\u00f6dinger's cat, and survey briefly some responses.\nConsider a spin-half particle in the pure state with state-vector \u03b1|0i + \u03b2|1i, where |\u03b1|2 + |\u03b2|2 = 1.\nSuppose a measurement is made of the PProM with elements {|0ih0|, |1ih1|}, resulting in the\noutcomes 0 and 1 with probabilities |\u03b1|2 , |\u03b2|2 . Next to the measurement device is a cage containing\na cat and a closed bottle of poison. If the outcome is 1, an apparatus automatically releases the\npoison and the cat dies. Otherwise, it lives. We suppose this whole system is enclosed in a large\ncontainer and isolated from the rest of the universe.\nNow the contents of that container are themselves just one large quantum system, and presumably it evolves unitarily under some Hamiltonian. If \u03b1 = 0, the final situation involves a\ndead cat. Let us denote its state-vector then by |deadi. If \u03b2 = 0 then the final state of the\n39\n\n\fcat has state-vector |alivei. So by linearity, in general the final state of the cat has state-vector\n\u03b1|alivei + \u03b2|deadi. How would the cat experience being in this state?\nWhen the container is opened and we look in, presumably a measurement does take place of\nthe state of the cat, and at that moment (and only at that moment) it collapses into one of the\ntwo states with state-vectors |alivei, |deadi with the probabilities |\u03b1|2 , |\u03b2|2 . Recently, a number\nof experiments have been done which are purported to produce Schr\u00f6dinger cats, in the sense\nof quantum superpositions of macroscopically distinct physical states of physical systems. For\ninstance, Mooij et al. (1999) report on an experiment in which an electronic current involving of the\norder of a billion (109 ) electrons flows in a superposition of clockwise and anticlockwise directions\naround a supercooled alumuminium ring of a few micrometers in diameter (a thousand times larger\nthan a typical molecular dimension). See Gill (2001b) for a discussion of this experiment and of\nthe role of quantum statistics in confirming its success.\nThe situation is made more complicated when another person, known in the literature as\nWigner's friend, is included in the system. He is in a room together with the container and at\nsome point looks in the container. Only later does he report his findings to us.\nThis weird story accentuates some strange features of quantum mechanics. We told it as if 'the\nstate' of a quantum system is something with physical reality, as it were, 'engraved' in the particles\nconstituting the system. This idea leads us to suppose states exist which are very hard to imagine,\nand never observed in the real world. We see that the 'collapse of the state-vector', supposed to\noccur when a measurement takes place, seems to contradict the fact that measurement devices\nare physical systems themselves, and the device and the system being measured should evolve\nunitarily, not suddenly jump randomly from one state to another. We see that the dividing line\nbetween quantum system and the outside world is completely arbitrary, yet plays a central role in\nthe theory (separating deterministic unitary evolution from random state-collapse).\nMany different standpoints can be taken on these issues. The most extreme are those of the\nempiricist (or instrumentalist, or pragmatician) on the one hand, and the realist (who is actually\nan idealist) on the other. The empiricist does not believe in some kind of physical reality behind\nobserved facts. He is interested only in making correct predictions about observable features of\nthe world. For this person the only problem in our story is that the dividing line between quantum\nsystem and classical environment is somewhat arbitrary. If different descriptions lead to different\nprescriptions, there is a problem with the mathematical model. Below we present a simplified\nversion of a consistency argument, which aims to show that there is no conflict between the two\ningredients of quantum theory, and no inconsistency when the Heisenberg divide between quantum\nsystem and outside world may be placed at several different places.\nVery similar considerations as those used in the consistency argument are also often used\nto argue that the von Neumann (random) collapse of the wave function can be derived from\n(deterministic) Schr\u00f6dinger evolution. However we are inclined to believe that such claims are\nincomplete. If one believes that the state of things in the world is described by wave-functions, one\nstill has a problem in relating wave-functions to physical properties of real objects. This problem\nis supposedly addressed by Everett's many worlds theory, van Fraassen's modal interpretation,\nand Griffiths' and Omn\u00e8s' theory of consistent histories, among others. We find none of these\nattempts to make von Neumann redundant very convincing. However, the realist who wants the\nwave-function to be actually there in reality, and who believes that the true dynamics of physical\nsystems is according to Schr\u00f6dinger's equation alone, is forced in this direction. For cosmologists,\nwanting to model the whole universe without external observer, there seems to be a problem, since\nquantum randomness is a key part of modern theories of the origin of the universe.\nThe alternative for the realist is to extend or alter Schr\u00f6dinger's dynamics in order to introduce\na random element, which should make no difference to small quantum systems but should 'simulate'\nthe von Neumann collapse, on big ones. Two fairly well explored variants of this idea are Bohm's\nhidden variables model, and the 'continuous spontaneous localisation' model of Ghirardi, Rimini\nand Weber. Most physicists are unhappy about these theories, since their claim to legitimacy is\nessentially that they reproduce unitary evolution and wave-function collapse in the two extreme\nsituations where these should hold; 'in between' the physics is too difficult to make predictions, let\nalone test them by experiment. Thus the models do not seem to have new, testable consequences,\n40\n\n\fwhile they include variables which determine the outcome of measurement, hence must be nonlocal.\nNow we turn to the consistency argument, which aims to show that there is no contradiction\nbetween Schr\u00f6dinger evolution and von Neumann collapse, in the sense that placing the dividing\nline between quantum system and outside world at different levels does not lead to different\nconclusions (at least, for an observer who is always in the outside world). This particular version\nwas communicated to us by Franz Merkl.\nConsider a spin-half particle which passes through the magnetic field of a Stern-Gerlach apparatus and then, if its spin is 'up', hits a photographic plate where a chain reaction produces a\nvisible spot. If the spin is 'down' suppose the particle is lost. (This is a bit simpler than allowing\nthe spin-down particle to hit the photographic plate at a different position: we have to model\nthe interaction only in the spin-up case). We will call the photographic plate the detector. If the\nparticle starts in the state \u03b1|0i + \u03b2|1i, where where |0i and |1i represent spin-up and spin-down\nrespectively, and the coefficients \u03b1 and \u03b2 satisfy |\u03b1|2 + |\u03b2|2 = 1, we get to see the spot with\nprobability |\u03b1|2 . Now the consistency problem arises because we could just as well have considered particle plus photographic plate as one large quantum system evolving jointly under some\nHamiltonian for some length of time. If the detector started off in some pure state, then the final\njoint state of the joint system is another pure state, and no random jump to one of two possible\nfinal states has taken place. Let us however admit that the large system of the photographic\nplate involves many, many particles, and repetition of the experiment with the whole system in an\nidentical pure state is physically meaningless to consider. At each repetition there are myriads of\ntiny differences. Therefore physically relevant predictions are only obtained when we use a mixed\nstate as input for the macroscopic system. To make the mathematics even more simple, we will\nsuppose that what varies from instance to instance is the length of time of the interaction. Let |\u03c8i\nbe the state-vector of the detector, before the interaction starts. The joint system starts in the\npure state with state-vector (\u03b1|0i + \u03b2|1i) \u2297 |\u03c8i. Now the Hamiltonian of the interaction between\nparticle and detector must be of the form |0ih0| \u2297 H where H acts on the huge Hilbert space of\nthe detector, since there is a change to the detector if the particle starts in the spin-up state, but\nnot at all if the particle starts in the spin-down state. Let the length of time of the interaction be\n\u03c4 . Then the final state of the joint system after the interaction is the pure state with state-vector\n\u03b1|0i \u2297 e\u2212iH\u03c4 /~ |\u03c8i + \u03b2|1i \u2297 |\u03c8i. The corresponding density-matrix can be written out, partitioned\naccording to the first component of the joint system, as\n\u0012 2 \u2212iH\u03c4 /~\n\u0013\n|\u03b1| e\n|\u03c8ih\u03c8|eiH\u03c4 /~ \u03b1\u03b2e\u2212iH\u03c4 /~ |\u03c8ih\u03c8|\n\u03b1\u03b2|\u03c8ih\u03c8|eiH\u03c4 /~\n|\u03b2|2 |\u03c8ih\u03c8|\nNow suppose we replace H\u03c4 by H\u03c4 + I\u01eb where I is the identity matrix. The idea here is that H\u03c4\nmust in some sense be large, since it produces a macroscopic change in a large quantum system.\nThus this is a tiny perturbation of the interaction if \u01eb is small, but on the other hand, since ~ is\nso tiny, \u01eb/~ can still be very large. As we vary \u01eb smoothly over some small interval, \u01eb/~ varies\nsmoothly over a huge range of values, and therefore the fractional part of \u01eb/(2\u03c0~) is close to\nuniformly distributed over the interval [0, 1]. Consequently, the factor e\u2212i\u01eb/~ is close to uniformly\ndistributed over the unit circle. Now after we have made this perturbation to the interaction, the\ndensity matrix of the joint state is\n\u0013\n\u0012 2 \u2212iH\u03c4 /~\n|\u03b1| e\n|\u03c8ih\u03c8|eiH\u03c4 /~ e\u2212i\u01eb/~ \u03b1\u03b2e\u2212iH\u03c4 /~ |\u03c8ih\u03c8|\n.\n|\u03b2|2 |\u03c8ih\u03c8|\nei\u01eb/~ \u03b1\u03b2|\u03c8ih\u03c8|eiH\u03c4 /~\nOn averaging over \u01eb, the off-diagonal factors disappear and we find the density matrix\n\u0013\n\u0012 2 \u2212iH\u03c4 /~\n|\u03b1| e\n|\u03c8ih\u03c8|eiH\u03c4 /~\n0\n.\n0\n|\u03b2|2 |\u03c8ih\u03c8|\nThis is the density matrix of the joint system which with probability |\u03b1|2 is in the pure state\nwith state-vector |0i \u2297 e\u2212iH\u03c4 /~ |\u03c8i and with probability |\u03b2|2 is in the pure state with state-vector\n41\n\n\f|1i \u2297 |\u03c8i. In other words, either a spin-up particle and a detector which indicates a particle was\ndetected, or a spin-down particle and a detector which indicates no particle was detected.\nThis argument is simple and one can criticise it in many ways. One would prefer to put the\ninitial randomness into the many particles making up the detector, rather than into the interaction,\nand it should not have such a special form. But this is not a problem. Much more realistic models\ncan be worked through which lead to the same qualitative conclusion: allowing variability in the\ninitial conditions of the macroscopic measuring device, of a most innocuous kind, allows random\nphase factors such as e\u2212i\u01eb/~ to wipe out off-diagonal terms in a large density matrix, so that all\nfuture predictions of the joint system are the same as if a random jump had occured during the\ninitial interaction to one of two macroscopically distinct states.\nIn conclusion, it seems that as long as one is interested in using quantum mechanics only\nto predict what happens in a small part of the universe, and takes the randomness of quantum\nmechanics as intrinsic, not something which should be explained in a deterministic way, there are\nno logical inconsistencies in the theory. The state vector or state matrix of a quantum system\nshould not be thought of as having an objective reality, somehow 'engraved' in the physical nature\nof a single instance of some quantum system, but is rather a characteristic of the preparation of the\nquantum system which, at least conceptually if not actually, could be repeated many times. Thus\na statistical description goes in, and a statistical description comes out. The working quantum\nphysicist even makes do without the von Neumann collapse of a quantum system, on measurement,\nsince realistic quantum mechanical modelling of the quantum system under study together with\nthe macroscopic measurement device allows one to introduce statistical variation in the initial state\nof the measurement device of the kind we have just described, and this leads irrevocably, it seems,\nto density matrices which are diagonal in the bases expressing macroscopically distinguishable\nstates. In other words, unitary evolution alone, starting from the mixed initial state of quantum\nsystem plus measuring environment, is enough to determine the correct probability distribution\nover macroscopically distinguishable, thus 'real world', outcomes. The working quantum physicist\nis also well aware that the Hamiltonians he uses are only 'effective Hamiltonians' relative to some\nenergy cut-off, which in turn corresponds to some approximation of a much larger state space by a\nsmaller one. So the concerns of workers in the foundations of physics, worried about whether 'the\nstate vector of the universe' evolves in a unitary, deterministic way, or a random, non-unitary way,\ncould turn out in the long run to be as purely academic as those of medieval theologians trying\nto calculate how many angels could dance on the head of a pin, since sooner or later physicists\nwill learn that quantum mechanics was itself only a limiting case of a better theory, as happened\nto Newtonian mechanics before. If we think about it carefully, we realise that the reality of basic\nconcepts of classical physics is as illusory as that of basic concepts of modern physics.\n\n9\n9.1\n\nSome Further Topics\nQuantum stochastic processes\n\nSince its inception in the early 1980's, through pioneering work of Hudson and Parthasarathy,\nquantum-or noncommutative-probability has grown into a mature and sophisticated mathematical field. The criticsm which we levelled at the philosphical standpoint of its protagonists\nin Section 8.1 does nothing to reduce the mathematical and physical results which have been\nachieved; see, for instance, Accardi et al. (1997). An excellent introduction to the field has been\ngiven by Biane (1995) and a more comprehensive account is available from the hand of Meyer\n(1993), see also Parthasarathy (1992). A new journal Infinite Dimensional Analysis, Quantum\nProbability and Related Topics, now in its fourth year, is home to many of the more recent developments. Here we shall summarise briefly some aspects of quantum stochastic processes, under\nseveral subheadings.\nQuantum optics Quantum optics is one of the currently most active and exciting fields of\nquantum physics, particularly from the viewpoint of the present paper. Laser cooling, on which\n\n42\n\n\fwe comment separately below, is, or may be viewed as, one of the areas in this field. Here we\ndiscuss briefly the Markov quantum (optical) master equation (MQME) and its quantum stochastic\ndifferential equation (QSDE) counterparts.\nThe Markovian quantum master equation provides an (approximate) description of a wide\nrange of quantum system evolutions. The MQME is of the form\n\u03c1\u0307(t) = L(t)\u03c1(t),\nwhere L(t) is a linear operator. In order for this equation to have a solution such that \u03c1(t) is a\ndensity operator for each t, L(t) must be of the Lindblad form (Lindblad 1976)\n\u0011\nX\u0010\n1\n1\ni\nAk \u03c1A\u2217k \u2212 \u03c1A\u2217k Ak \u2212 A\u2217k Ak \u03c1 ,\nL\u03c1 = \u2212 [H, \u03c1] +\n~\n2\n2\n\n(47)\n\nk\n\nwhere H is some Hermitian operator and the Ak are (bounded) operators. To each such operator\nthere exists a variety of QSDE's for a process \u03c8(t) with values in H such that, writing \u03c1\u0302(t) =\n|\u03c8(t)ih\u03c8(t)|/h\u03c8(t)|\u03c8(t)i, we have E[\u03c1\u0302(t)] = \u03c1(t). See, for instance, M\u00f8lmer and Castin (1996),\nWiseman (1996) and Gardiner and Zoller (2000, Chap. 5).\nInterestingly, the same Markov quantum master equation has turned up in the Ghirardi-RiminiWeber 'continuous spontaneous localisation' approach to the measurement problem, whereby unitary Schr\u00f6dinger evolution is replaced by a stochastic differential equation, which is able to mimic,\naccording to the circumstances, both purely unitary evolution of a closed quantum system, and\nthe von Neumann collapse of the wave function of a quantum system interacting with a large\n(measuring) environment.\nTo illustrate how equation (47) can be numerically calculated by simulating many times a\nQSDE in what is called the quantum Monte Carlo approach, we consider the simplest case, when\nthe index k just takes a single value and can therefore be omitted. Moreover, absorb the constant\n~ into the Hamiltonian H. We show that the evolution is identical to the mean evolution of\nthe following stochastic process for an unnormalised state vector \u03c8: the deterministic but nonHamiltonian evolution\n1\n\u03c8\u0307 = \u2212 iH\u03c8 \u2212 A\u2217 A\u03c8\n2\ninterupted by collapses\n\u03c8 \u2192 A\u03c8\nwith stochastic intensity\nI = kA\u03c8k2 /k\u03c8k2 .\nIntroducing a counting process N with intensity I one can combine these equations into one QSDE\nof jump type,\n1\nd\u03c8 = (\u2212iH\u03c8 \u2212 A\u2217 A\u03c8)dt + (A\u03c8 \u2212 \u03c8)dN.\n2\nDefine \u03c1e = \u03c8\u03c8 \u2217 , the unnormalised random density matrix corresponding to the stochastic evolution, and \u03c1b = \u03c1e/tr \u03c1e. Note that I = tr(Ae\n\u03c1A\u2217 )/tr \u03c1e = tr(Ab\n\u03c1A\u2217 )/tr \u03c1b. Since de\n\u03c1 = d\u03c8.\u03c8 \u2217 + \u03c8.d\u03c8 \u2217\nand \u03c8 \u0307\u2217 = i\u03c8 \u2217 H \u2212 21 \u03c8 \u2217 A\u03c8, the smooth part of the evolution can be rewritten as\n1\n\u03c1 + \u03c1eA\u2217 A).\n\u03c1\u0117 = \u2212 i[H, \u03c1e] \u2212 (A\u2217 Ae\n2\n\nTaking the trace, we find on the smooth part d(tr \u03c1e) = \u2212tr(Ae\n\u03c1A\u2217 ). Together, this yields\n\u03c1\n1 de\n\u03c1e d(tr \u03c1e)\ndb\n\u03c1\n=\n\u2212\ndt\ntr \u03c1e dt\n(tr \u03c1e)2 dt\n1\n= \u2212 i[H, \u03c1b] \u2212 (A\u2217 Ab\n\u03c1 + \u03c1bA\u2217 A) + I \u03c1b.\n2\n43\n\n\fFor the jump part, define N (t) to be the number of jumps in the time interval (0, t]. Then at a\njump time we can write\n\u0011\n\u0010 Ab\n\u03c1\u2212 A\u2217\ndN\n\u2212\n\u03c1\nb\n\u2212\ntr(Ab\n\u03c1\u2212 A\u2217 )\n\u0010 Ab\n\u0011\n\u03c1\u2212 A\u2217\n=\n\u03c1\u2212 A\u2217 \u2212 I \u03c1b\u2212 )dt.\n\u2212 \u03c1b\u2212 (dN \u2212 Idt) + (Ab\nI(t)\n\ndb\n\u03c1 =\n\nTogether this gives, at all time points,\ndb\n\u03c1 =\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n1\n\u2212i[H, \u03c1b] \u2212 (A\u2217 Ab\n\u03c1 + \u03c1bA\u2217 A) + Ab\n\u03c1A\u2217 dt\n2\n\u0010 Ab\n\u0011\n\u03c1\u2212 A\u2217\n+\n\u2212 \u03c1b\u2212 (dN \u2212 Idt).\nI(t)\n\nTaking the expectation throughout, the martingale part (the second line) of this equation disappears, and \u03c1b in the first line is replaced by its expected value which we call \u03c1. The resulting\nnonstochastic differential equation for \u03c1 is precisely (47). Moreover since \u03c1b was by construction\na random density matrix (nonnegative, self-adjoint and trace one) we see that the solution \u03c1 of\n(47), being the expected value of a density matrix, is also a density matrix; something which is\nnot obvious from (47).\nExample 13 (Quantum Monte Carlo for spin-half ). Consider a two dimensional quantum\nsystem and choose a basis such that H = E1 |1ih1| + E2 |2ih2|, for real numbers E1 and E2 .\nThese are the two energy levels of the Hamiltonian. Suppose A is diagonal in this basis with\nA|2i = \u03b1|1i and A|1i = 0 (the zero vector), where \u03b1 is real. This is the model for the energy\nof a two-level atom which, on the spontaneous emission of a photon to its environment, can\ndecay from its excited state to its ground state. Consider the evolution of an unnormalised\nstate \u03c8 = c1 |1i + c2 |2i, where c1 and c2 are complex functions of time. One discovers, since H\nand A\u2217 A are simultaneously diagonalizable, that the smooth part of the evolution decouples as\n\u010b1 = (\u2212iE1 \u2212 12 \u03b12 )c1 , \u010b2 = (\u2212iE2 )c1 . Thus starting in state |1i or in state |2i, we stay there, as\nlong as no collapse occurs. If we are in state |2i collapse has intensity 0. However in state |1i there\nis a constant intensity \u03b12 of collapse to state |1i. Thus starting in state |1i, the QSDE predicts\nan exponential waiting time of collapse to |2i with rate \u03b12 . The reader may like to compute the\nprobability distribution of the time to collapse to state |2i, starting from an arbitary pure state\n\u03c8 = \u03b1|1i + \u03b2|2i.\nAs we remarked above, the same Lindblad equation can be represented as the mean evolution\nof a whole range of QSDE's, of jump type, diffusion type, and mixed type. Consider the same\nLindblad equation as we were discussing above (no \u221a\nsummation over k, drop ~). For an arbitrary\nreal number \u03bc define two matrices D\u00b1 = (\u03bc1 \u00b1 A)/ 2. Then the original Lindblad equation can\nbe rewritten again in Lindblad form, with two different values of k, and the corresponding Ak\nbeing D+ and D\u2212 . This has a Quantum Monte Carlo representation of a smooth evolution \u03c8\u0307 =\n(\u2212iH \u2212 12 D+ D+ \u2217 \u2212 21 D\u2212 D\u2212 \u2217 )\u03c8, interupted by collapses \u03c8 \u2192 D\u00b1 \u03c8 with intensities kD\u00b1 \u03c8k2 /k\u03c8k2 .\nThe total intensity of jumps can be calculated as \u03bc2 +kA\u03c8k2 /k\u03c8k2 . As \u03bc \u2192 \u221e the rate of jumping\nincreases without limit, but the relative change in the state at each jump becomes smaller and\nsmaller. In the limit (after normalising suitably) one obtains a diffusion representation\n!\n\u0011\n\u0011\n1\u0010 \u2217\n1 \u2217\n1 \u2217 \u2217\n1\u0010\nd\u03c6 = \u2212iH\u03c6 +\n\u03c6 A\u03c6.A \u2212 A A \u2212 \u03c6 A \u03c6.\u03c6\u2217 A\u03c6 \u03c6 dt +\n2A \u2212 \u03c6\u2217 A\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6\u2217 A\u2217 \u03c6 dW\n2\n2\n2\n2\nwhere W is of course a standard Wiener process.\nLaser cooling The paper by M\u00f8lmer and Castin (1996) on Monte Carlo techniques, for calculating expectation values for dissipative quantum systems, has been instrumental in particular in\n44\n\n\fthe context of laser cooling. Laser cooling is a topic of great current in interest in physics, both\nfrom the theoretical point of view and in terms of experimental advances opening up possibilities\nof studying many basic quantum phenomena, for instance Bose\u2013Einstein condensation.\nFor a full understanding of the posssibility of subrecoil cooling, leading physicists were led\nto develop theoretical results that from the viewpoint of probability belong to renewal theory\nand add interesting new results and problems to that theory. For an introduction to this, see\nBarndorff-Nielsen and Benth (2001). A comprehensive account is given in Bardou, Bouchaud, Aspect, and Cohen-Tannou\n(2001). Barndorff-Nielsen, Benth, and Jensen (2000a,b) present some extensions to the setting of\n(classical) Markov processes.\nQuantum infinite divisibility and L\u00e9vy processes Several types of quantum analogues\nof infinite divisibility and L\u00e9vy processes have recently been introduced. Two belong to free\nprobability and are mentioned below. Infinitely divisible instruments and associated instrumental\nprocesses with independent increments are discussed in Holevo (2001a). See also Meyer (1993,\nChap. 7), Barchielli and Paganoni (1996), and Albeverio, R\u00fcdiger, and Wu (2001).\nFree probability and random matrices The subject area of free probability evolves around\nthe concept of free independence, also termed freeness. The latter was originally introduced\nby Voiculescu in the mid 1980's in a study of free-group von Neumann factors but was shortly\nafterwards realised to be naturally connected to the limiting properties of products of large and\nindependent self-adjoint random matrices (of complex numbers). More specifically, suppose that\n(n)\nXi , i = 1, . . . , r, are independent n \u00d7 n random matrices, the entries in each of these matrices\nbeing also independent, and consider the mean values of the form\n(n)\n\n(n)\n\nE[tr(Xi1 . . . Xip )].\n\n(48)\n\nUnder some mild regularity assumptions, for any given index set i1 , . . . , ip and for n \u2192 \u221e, the\nquantity (48) will have a limiting value, and the collection of such mean values corresponds to a\n(n)\n(n)\nrandom limiting object. Freeness expresses how the independence of X1 , . . . , Xr is reflected in\nproperties of that object. It is now possible to develop a theory of free infinite divisibility and free\nL\u00e9vy processes that to a large extent parallels that of infinite divisibility and L\u00e9vy processes in\nclassical probability but also exhibit intriguing differences from the latter. There is, in particular,\na one-to-one correspondence between the class of infinitely divisible laws in the classical sense and\nthe class of the free infinitely divisible laws, with the 'free normal distribution' being the Wigner,\nor semicircle, law which has probability density\n\u03c0 \u22121 (1 \u2212 x2 /2)1/2 .\nThis law was first derived by Wigner in the 1950's as the limiting law of the distribution of\neigenvalues of a random Hermitian matrix X (n) with independent, complex Gaussian entries.\nWigner's motivation for studying the eigenvalue distribution was based on the supposition that\nthe local statistical behaviour of the energy levels of a sufficiently complex physical system is\napproximately simulated by that of the eigenvalues of a random matrix (Hamiltonian), see Wigner\n(1958) and Mehta (1967).\nMore detailed summaries of the mathematical connections indicated above are available in\nBiane (1998a,b) and Barndorff-Nielsen and Thorbj\u00f8rnsen (2001). Furthermore, there are deep\nconnections between the theory of random matrices and that of longest increasing subsequences, see\nfor instance Deift (2000). We also wish to draw attention to a recent paper by Biane and Speicher\n(2001) which introduces a concept of free Fisher information.\nGeneral framework and continuous-time measurements The generic mathematical description of the measurement process embodied in formula (8) applies, in particular, to situations where a quantum system is observed continuously over a time interval [0, T ]. For each\ntime point t \u2208 [0, T ], a representation such as in (8) is available for the data as available\n45\n\n\fat that moment, but it is a highly non-trivial task, carried out by Loubenets (1999, 2000),\nBarndorff-Nielsen and Loubenets (2001) to mesh these representations together in an interpretable\nand canonical fashion. For simplicity, consider the case when the index i in (8) takes only one value\nand hence can be omitted. Often the outcome of a measurement of this type can be considered as\nthe realisation of a cadlag stochastic process xT0 = {xt : 0 \u2264 t \u2264 T } on R and the evolution of this\nand of the quantum system are determined by a probability measure \u03bd on D[0, T ] and a collection\nof mappings Wst (xt0 ), 0 \u2264 s < t \u2264 T from X = D[0, T ] to B(H), satisfying the normalisation\nrelations\nZ\nWst (xt0 )\u2217 Wst (xt0 )\u03bd(dxts |xs0 ) = I\nD[0,T ]\n\nand the cocycle conditions\nWst (xt0 ) = W\u03c4t (xt0 )Ws\u03c4 (x\u03c40 ) .\nIf the initial state of the quantum system in the Hilbert space H is a pure state \u03c80 then its\nevolutionary trajectory, conditional on xT0 , is given by\n\u03c8t (xt0 ) = Wst (xt0 )\u03c80 .\nUnder suitable further conditions, the evolutions of xt and \u03c8t will be Markovian.\n\n9.2\n\nDifferential-geometric aspects\n\nIn asymptotic parametric inference, differential geometry has proved to be an appropriate language for expressing various key concepts, see Barndorff-Nielsen and Cox (1994, Chaps. 5\u20137),\nKass and Vos (1997). Likewise, several concepts in quantum mechanics have differential-geometric\ninterpretations. In particular, the quantum information I(\u03b8) of a parametric quantum model is a\nRiemannian metric on the parameter space \u0398, as is the Fisher information i(\u03b8; M ) obtained by\na measurement M . There are many other Riemannian metrics of importance in quantum theory. A characterisation of a large class of them is given in Petz (1994). See also Petz and Sud\u00e1r\n(1999). Any (complex) Riemannian metric on the space SA(H) of self-adjoint operators on a finitedimensional H (and satisfying some mild conditions) yields an inequality analogous to Helstrom's\nquantum Cram\u00e9r\u2013Rao inequality (19). These inequalities and results on geometries obtained from\nsuitable real-valued functions on \u0398 \u00d7 \u0398 are given in Amari and Nagaoka (2000, Chap. 7). Some\nother differential-geometric aspects of quantum theory are considered in Brody and Hughston\n(2001).\n\n9.3\n\nConcluding Remarks\n\nThis paper has sketched some main features of quantum statistical inference, and more generally,\nquantum stochastic modelling. The basic concepts for our paper coincide with the basic concepts\nof quantum computation, quantum cryptography, quantum information theory, see Gruska (1999,\n2001), Nielsen and Chuang (2000). We hope that many statisticians will venture into these areas\ntoo, as we are convinced that probabilistic modelling and statistical thinking will play major roles\nthere, and should not be left purely to computer scientists or theoretical physicists.\nAcknowledgements We gratefully acknowledge Mathematische Forschungsinstitut Oberwolfach for support through the Research in Pairs programme, and the European Science Foundation's programme on quantum information for supporting a working visit to the University of\nPavia.\nWe have benefitted from conversations with many colleagues.

With\n\u03c0(dx; \u03c1, N ) denoting the probability distribution of the outcome of the measurement, and \u03c3(x; \u03c1, N )\ndenoting the posterior state when the prior state is \u03c1 and the outcome of the measurement is x,\nwe have\nZ\ntr{\u03c1N (A)[Y ]} =\n\u03c0(dx; \u03c1, N )tr{(\u03c3(x; \u03c1, N )Y }\nA\n\nThus if one 'measures the instrument' on the state \u03c1, registers whether or not the outcome is in\nA, and subsequently measures the observable Y , the expected value of the outcome so obtained\nequals the expected value of the outcome of measuring directly the osbervable N (A)[Y ].\n\nA.1\n\nComplete Positivity\n\nThe observables N (A)[Y ] are sigma-additive in A, linear in Y , nonnegative in Y (map non-negative\noperators to non-negative operators), and normalised by N (X )[1] = 1. Any collection satisfying\nthese constraints is called a positive instrument. Now given a positive instrument N defined\non a Hilbert space H, we can extend the instrument to the tensor product of this space with\nanother Hilbert space K by defining N (A)[Y \u2297 Z] = N (A)[Y ] \u2297 Z. This corresponds intuitively\nto measuring N on the first component of a quantum system in the product space, leaving the\nsecond component untouched. By linearity, once the extended instrument is defined on product\nobservables like Y \u2297 Z, it is defined on all observables of the product system. An instrument N\nis called completely positive if and only if every such extension (i.e., for any auxiliary system K)\nremains positive. It turns out that one need only verify the positivity of the extensions for K of\ndimension 2, 3, . . . , dim(H) + 1.\nHere is a classic example of an instrument which is positive, but not completely positive, hence\nis not physically realisable.\nExample 14 (A positive, but not completely positive, instrument). Let the outcome space\nbe trivial (consisting of a single element) so the instrument only transforms the incoming state, and\ndoes not generate any data. We therefore just specify an observable N [Y ] for each observable Y : we\ndefine it by N [Y ] = Y \u22a4 , the transpose of the observable Y . This correspondsPto the outcome state\n\u03c3(\u03c1; N ) = \u03c1\u22a4 . Now take K = H, of finite dimension d, and define |\u03c8i = d1 i |ii \u2297 |ii where the\nvectors |ii form an orthonormal basis of H, take \u03c1 = P\n|\u03c8ih\u03c8|. LetP\u03c3 = \u03c1\u22a4 denote\nP\nP the corresponding\noutput state. As a matrix operating on vectors, \u03c3( i ci |ii \u2297 j dj |ji) = ( i di |ii \u2297 j cj |ji).\nThus in particular, \u03c3 maps |ii \u2297 |ji \u2212 |ji \u2297 |ii to minus itself. Hence it has negative eigenvalues,\nand therefore cannot be a density matrix.\nAny dominated measurement M can be embedded into an instrument. The simplest way is by\n1\n1\ntaking the posterior states to be m(x) 2 \u03c1m(x) 2 /tr(\u03c1m(x)) for each outcome x having a positive\ndensity tr(\u03c1m(x)) with respect to the same measure \u03bd which dominates M . This corresponds to\n1\nthere being only one index i in (8), and W (x) = m(x) 2 .\nThe next example illustrates the need to allow unbounded operators Wi (x) in (8), even if the\ncompletely positive instrument in question is bounded.\nExample 15 (Position measurement). As in Section 7.1 take as Hilbert space H = L2C (R)\nand consider the PProM corresponding to the position observable Q. Thus the operator Q simply\nmultiplies an L2 function of x by the identity function x 7\u2192 x. The PProM has elements M (B), for\neach Borel subset B of the real line, equal to the operator which multiplies an L2 function by 1B ,\nthe indicator function of the set B. In other words, M (B) projects onto the subspace of functions\nwhich are zero outside B. The intuitively natural way to consider this measurement as part of an\ninstrument would be to take the posterior state, given that the outcome is x \u2208 R, to be a deltafunction at the point x. This is not an element of H. However, one can easily imagine the following\ninstrument N : measure Q, and replace the quantum system by a new particle in the fixed state \u03c10 ,\n47\n\n\findependently of the outcome x. (We reconsider the original instrument, later). By the physical\ninterpretation of N (B)[Y ], we must have, for any state \u03c1, that tr(\u03c1N (B)[Y ]) = tr(\u03c11B )tr(\u03c10 Y ).\nSuppose \u03c10 is the pure state with state vector |\u03c80 i. Then informally, in (8), one should have a\nsingle index i, dominating measure \u03bd equal to Lebesgue measure, and W (x) = |xih\u03c80 | where the\n|xi stands for the delta-function at x, thus is not a particular member of H, but is defined through\nthe formula hx|\u03c8i = \u03c8(x). Thus W (x) is the operator defined on the subspace of continuous\nL2 functions \u03c8 by W (x)\u03c8 = \u03c8(x)\u03c80 . It cannot be extended in a continuous way to all of L2 ,\nand is therefore an unbounded operator. The instrument N can be written as N (dx)[Y ] =\n|\u03c80 ih\u03c80 | hx|Y |xi dx, or N (B)[Y ] = |\u03c80 ih\u03c80 |h1B |Y |1B i, which is defined for all bounded operators\nY and arbitrary Borel sets B.\nReconsider the instrument N \u2032 defined formally by\nR W (x) = |xihx|. Formally, we should have\n\u2032\nN (dx)[Y ] = |xihx|hx|Y |xidx and thus N \u2032 (B)[Y ] = B |xihx|hx|Y |xidx. This formula is supposed\nto represent an observable, i.e., a possibly unbounded operator\nR on H. To find out what it does,\nwe manipulate with delta-functions to find h\u03c6|N \u2032 (B)[Y ]|\u03c8i = R 1B \u03c6\u03c8d\u03bcY where \u03bcY is the finite\nmeasure on the real line defined by \u03bcY (A) = h1A |Y |1A i. Note that \u03bcY is absolutely continuous\nwith repect to Lebesgue measure \u03bd. Thus N \u2032 (B)[Y ] is defined on the subspace of L2 functions,\nsquare integrable on B with respect to \u03bcY , and on that subspace it acts by multiplying by the\nfunction 1B * d\u03bcY /d\u03bd. The instrument N \u2032 is unbounded. It has an informal representation (8)\ninvolving objects W which cannot even be considered as unbounded operators, and there does\nnot exist a posterior state for each outcome x of the instrument. There is a well-defined posterior\nstate given the outcome\nR lies in a set B of positive probability \u03c0(B; \u03c1) = tr(\u03c11B ). It is formally\ndefined by \u03c3(B; \u03c1) = B |xihx|\u03c0(dx|B; \u03c1).\n\nA.2\n\nProjection and Dilation of Measurements\n\nLet \u03a0 : H\u2032 \u2192 H be the orthogonal projection of a Hilbert space H\u2032 onto a subspace H. Then \u03a0\ninduces a map\n\u03a0\u2217 : OProM(X , H\u2032 ) \u2192 OProM(X , H)\nby\n(\u03a0\u2217 (M ))(A) = \u03a0M (A)\u03a0\u2217\n\nA \u2208 A.\n\n(49)\n\u2217\n\nIn the physical literature, the OProM M is said to be a dilation or extension of \u03a0 (M ).\nThe following theorem shows that every OProM can be obtained from some PProM by the\nabove construction: every generalised measurement can be dilated to a simple measurement.\nTheorem 7 (Naimark 1940). Given M in OProM(X , H), there is (i) a Hilbert space H\u2032 containing H, (ii) a projection-valued probability measure M \u2032 in PProM(X , H\u2032 ), such that\n\u03a0\u2217 (M \u2032 ) = M\n(in the sense of (49)), where \u03a0 : H\u2032 \u2192 H is the orthogonal projection.\nThe theorem of Naimark shows how to extend a generalised measurement to a simple measurement on a larger space. There is also an obvious way to consider a state on the smaller space\nas a state on the larger space, concentrating on the subspace. These two extensions together do\nnot have the same statistical behaviour as the original pair of state and measurement. Adapting\nthe proof of Naimark's theorem one can show how to extend an arbitrary state on the smaller\nspace to a state on a larger space, in a way which matches the extension of the measurement, and\ntogether reproduces the statistics of the original set-up. This is taken care of by Holevo's theorem,\nTheorem 1 at the end of subsection 2.2.\n\nB\n\nThe Braunstein\u2013Caves Argument\n\nA measurement M with density m with respect to a sigma-finite measure \u03bd is given. Its outcome\nhas density p(x; \u03b8) = tr{\u03c1(\u03b8)m(x)} with respect to \u03bd. In the argument below, \u03b8 is also fixed.\n48\n\n\f1\n\n1\n\nDefine X+ = {x : p(x; \u03b8) > 0} and X0 = {x : p(x; \u03b8) = 0}. Define A = A(x) = m(x) 2 \u03c1//\u03b8 \u03c1 2 ,\n1\n1\nB = B(x) = m(x) 2 \u03c1 2 , and z = tr{A\u2217 B}. Note that p(x; \u03b8) = tr{B \u2217 B}.\nThe proof of (31) given below consists of three inequality steps. The first will be an application\nof the trivial inequality R(z)2 \u2264 |z|2 with equality if and only if I(z) = 0. The second will be\nan application of the Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality |tr{A\u2217 B}|2 \u2264 tr{A\u2217 A}tr{B \u2217 B} with equality if\nand only if A and B are linearly dependent over the complex numbers. The last step consists of\nreplacing an integral of a nonnegative function over X+ by an integral over X . Here they are:\nZ\np(x; \u03b8)\u22121 (R tr(\u03c1\u03c1//\u03b8 m(x))2 \u03bd(dx)\ni(\u03b8; M ) =\nX+\nZ\np(x; \u03b8)\u22121 |tr(\u03c1\u03c1//\u03b8 m(x))|2 \u03bd(dx)\n\u2264\nX+\nZ\n\u00112\n\u0010\n1\n1\n1\n1\n(tr(\u03c1m(x)))\u22121 \u03bd(dx)\ntr m(x) 2 \u03c1 2 )\u2217 (m(x) 2 \u03c1//\u03b8 \u03c1 2\n=\nX+\nZ\ntr(m(x)\u03c1//\u03b8 \u03c1\u03c1//\u03b8 )\u03bd(dx)\n\u2264\nX+\nZ\ntr(m(x)\u03c1//\u03b8 \u03c1\u03c1//\u03b8 )\u03bd(dx)\n\u2264\nX\n\n= I(\u03b8).\n\n(50)\n\nThe necessary and sufficient conditions for equality at each of the three steps are therefore:\nI(tr{A(x)\u2217 B(x)}) = 0,\n\nZ\n\n\u03b1(x)A(x) + \u03b2(x)B(x) = 0,\ntr{A(x)\u2217 A(x)}\u03bd(dx) = 0,\n\nX0\n\nwhere \u03b1(x) and \u03b2(x) are arbitrary complex numbers, not both equal to zero, and the first two\nequalities are supposed to hold \u03bd-almost everywhere where p(x; \u03b8) is positive, while in the third\nequality X0 is precisely the set where p(x; \u03b8) is zero.\nNow if A(x) = r(x)B(x) for real r(x), for \u03bd almost all x, then A\u2217 B = rB \u2217 B and its trace is real.\nHence the first and second conditions are satisfied. Moreover, we then also have tr{A(x)A\u2217 (x)} =\nr(x)2 p(x; \u03b8) so the third condition is also satisfied.\nConversely, suppose all three conditions are satisfied. Since p(x; \u03b8) = tr{B(x)\u2217 B(x)}, on\nX+ we must have B non-zero and hence \u03b1 non-zero. So (still on X+ ) A \u221d B and the first\ncondition implies that the proportionality constant must be real. The third condition implies that\ntr{A(x)A(x)\u2217 } and hence A(x) is almost everywhere zero where p(x; \u03b8) = tr{B(x)\u2217 B(x)} = 0,\ni.e., where B(x) = 0. So certainly one may write A(x) = r(x)B(x) for some real r(x) there, too.\nIn Braunstein and Caves' somewhat sketchy proof, it seems to be assumed that p(x; \u03b8) is\neverywhere positive, hence only two inequality steps are involved. We note that the main ingredient\nof these proofs is the Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality. This is also the main step in proving Helstrom's\nquantum Cram\u00e9r\u2013Rao bound, and of course in proving the classical Cram\u00e9r\u2013Rao bound.\n\nReferences\nAccardi, L., S. Kozyrev, and I.
