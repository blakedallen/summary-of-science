Early perturbative studies [1, 2, 3] and twodimensional numerical evolutions of axisymmetric binaries (head-on collisions) [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9] were successful\nin producing late-stage waveforms representing gravitational radiation. However, the move to full 3D simulations of more general initial-data sets has proved extremely difficult. Evolutions using the \"standard ADM\"\n3+1 decomposition of Einstein's equations and simple\nzero-shift gauge conditions have stable lifetimes of \u223c\n15 \u2212 30M (where M is the total mass of the space-time),\nfar too short a time to complete a useful physical simulations, much less extract the gravitational radiation emitted - the ultimate aim of numerical source simulations.\nThe Lazarus project [10, 11] was conceived in the context of such limitations. Working under the assumption\nthat the late-evolution 3+1 data can be considered a perturbation of a single Kerr black hole, Lazarus extracts the\nradiation content everywhere in the numerical domain,\nand uses it as initial data for a Teukolsky perturbative\nevolution. In this manner, the original simulation may\nbe extended almost indefinitely, long enough to capture\nthe entire development of the outgoing radiation.\nThe beginning of the full-numerical simulation can also\nbe interfaced with a far limit approximation method and\nsimilar techniques to evaluate a common regime of applicability can be developed [11]. Here, for the sake of\ndefiniteness, we will assume a set of initial data as providing this interface values and focus on the full-numerical\n/ close limit matching.\n\nLazarus has been very successful, producing the first\nconvergent wave forms [10, 12, 13, 14, 15] from 3D evolutions. In most cases, a \"plateau\" was identified - a\nrange of extraction times T where the emitted energy\nremained flat and consistent. This plateau begins when\nthe 3+1 data is linearly perturbed from Kerr, and should\nend only when the radiation has begun to leave the 3+1\nnumerical domain altogether; at this latter time, Teukolsky extraction will no longer capture the full radiation\ncontent. However, the numerical instability of the 3+1\nsimulation may pollute the Teukolsky initial data for late\nextraction times. Somewhat surprisingly, such a plateau\nseems to exist even in situations where a common apparent horizon has yet to form, e.g., short-lived evolutions of\nso-called \"ISCO\" (Innermost Stable Circular Orbit ) and\n\"pre-ISCO\" runs.\nMeanwhile, great strides have been made in full 3D\nsimulations over the last decade, due to the casting of\nEinstein's equations into more numerically stable formulations [16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27,\n28], the development of advanced techniques for handling the singularities inherent in black-hole space-times\n[22, 29, 30], and the availability of increased computational resources, coupled with mesh-refinement techniques [31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36]. The culmination of these\nadvances is several successful evolutions of black-holebinary systems past the symbolic \"one orbit\" barrier\n[37, 38]. For physical systems requiring less than \u223c 100M\nof evolution time to reach a quiescent final state, these\nimprovements enable the direct extraction of radiation\nfrom the 3+1 fields, whether through Weyl curvature\ncomponents or Regge-Wheeler-Zerilli variables [39, 40].\nThese advances, however, do not lessen the relevance\nof the Lazarus project. Despite great progress in recent\nyears, it is fair to say that the problem of black-hole\nbinaries is not completely solved. The most astrophysically interesting simulations can still not be evolved long\n\n\f2\nenough to reach their assumed quiescent state. Directly\nextracted radiation is still calculated at observer locations that lie in the \"near-field zone\", or may be underresolved at more distant locations, and is in general polluted by poor outer-boundary conditions. As long as such\nlimitations exist, there is a place for perturbative methods such as Lazarus. Besides, numerical simulations are\nstill very computationally intensive, and avoiding the last\n\u2248 100M of binary black-hole evolutions means saving\ndays to weeks of supercomputer time.\nHowever, Lazarus makes approximations in its approach. Principal among these is the set of ad hoc choices\nneeded to translate the 3+1 curvature information into a\nKerr background + perturbations. The validity of these\nchoices will depend on the data being evolved, and is\ndifficult to quantify a priori.\nIn this paper, we update the Lazarus project in light of\nrecent work on transverse frames, in a way that may help\nresolve some of these issues. Beetle et al. [41] have proposed a way of identifying the principal directions of a numerical space-time in the 3+1 ADM split. This method\n- local in nature - allows us to narrow the gap between\nthe numerical tetrad and the Kinnersley tetrad appropriate to the Teukolsky evolution without any background\nassumptions. When calculated with such a tetrad, the\nlongitudinal Weyl scalars \u03a81 and \u03a83 will vanish, while\nthe \"monopole\" scalar \u03a82 will take on its Kinnersleytetrad value, and the transverse scalars \u03a80 and \u03a84 , which\ncarry the radiative degrees of freedom, will differ from\ntheir Kinnersley-tetrad values only by a complex factor. This remaining factor can be compensated for, on\na known Kerr background in Boyer-Lindquist (BL) coordinates, via a single spin-boost transformation at each\npoint in space.\nAlthough the quasi-Kinnersley frame by no means removes all uncertainties from the problem of radiative extraction, it goes sufficiently far that we expect it to improve the Lazarus procedure considerably. In particular,\nwe expect that the different - and more rigorous -\npath to Teukolsky waveforms will give us an error estimate for the tetrad dependence of original results, while\nthe robustness of the new technique should allow us to\nattempt consistent wave extraction from earlier in a numerical evolution.\nAdditionally, the quasi-Kinnersley frame may achieve\nmuch in the simpler problem of direct radiation extraction [41, 42, 43, 44, 45]. In the past [13], we used an approximate tetrad to calculate the Weyl scalar. Since the\nquasi-Kinnersley tetrad can be constructed locally, without knowing Kerr parameters and BL coordinates, we\nshould now achieve a better approximation to the Kinnersley tetrad during the 3+1 evolution, and thus directly\nextract waveforms without needing the background data.\nThe remainder of this paper is laid out as follows:\nin Section II, we summarize the essentials of the original Lazarus procedure for constructing Cauchy data for\nTeukolsky evolution, as well as some of the main results from this procedure. In Section III, we review the\n\nconcepts of transverse frames, and the quasi-Kinnersley\nframe, and describe the numerical implementation of\nthese concepts in our evolution code. In Section IV, we\npresent comparative results from the application of old\nand new techniques for three test problems, two of which\nhave already been addressed with original Lazarus [13].\nDiscussion of the results obtained, and future work can\nbe found in Section V. Appendix A contains expressions for several quantities related to the evaluation of\nWeyl scalars in a numerical tetrad in BL coordinates;\nAppendix B contains perturbative results for the three\ntest cases used in Section IV.\nA.\n\nNotation and Conventions\n\nIn the rest of the paper, we shall generally assume\na metric signature of (\u2212, +, +, +). Our use of algebraic quantities related to the Kerr-BL solution is nonstandard, but consistent with [11]; we use an additional\nquantity \u039b = r2 + a2 for compactness.\nOur sign convention for the definition of the Weyl\nscalars is such that for the Kerr solution in BL coordinates (and using the Kinnersley tetrad), the only nonvanishing scalar is \u03a82 = M/(r \u2212 i a cos \u03b8)3 .\nVector quantities are denoted by an arrow overhead,\nexcept for unit vectors, which are instead capped by a\ncircumflex (\u02c6). Complex conjugation is denoted by an\noverbar ( \u0304).\nII.\n\nTHE ORIGINAL LAZARUS METHOD\n\nHere we provide a summary of the \"original\" Lazarus\nprocedure; full details can be found in [11], which we shall\nrefer to as Paper I from now on.\nWe start with a full-numerical 3+1 evolution of a\nspace-time of interest. At some extraction (coordinate)\ntime T - before the simulation crashes due to numerical\ninstabilities - we map the evolved data to a black-hole\nperturbative evolution code [46, 47]. This simpler code\ncan then be evolved stably for as long as is needed to\ndetermine the full history of the gravitational radiation\ngenerated.\nTo assess the level of deviation from Kerr at late times\nin the 3+1 evolution, [48] introduced an invariant quantity, the speciality index :\nS = 27 J 2 /I 3 ,\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere the two complex curvature invariants I and J\nare essentially the square and cube of the self-dual part,\nCabcd = Cabcd + (i/2) \u01ebabmn C mn cd , of the Weyl tensor:\nI = Cabcd C abcd and J = Cabcd C cd mn C mnab .\n\n(2.2)\n\nThe geometrical significance of S is that it measures\ndeviations from algebraic speciality (in the Petrov classification of the Weyl tensor). For the unperturbed algebraically special (Petrov type D) Kerr solution, S = 1.\n\n\f3\nHowever, for interesting space-times involving nontrivial\ndynamics, like distorted black holes, which are in general not algebraically special (Petrov type I), we expect\nS = 1 + \u2206S, and the size of the deviation \u2206S 6= 0, with\nleading second perturbative order, can be used to assess\nthe applicability of black-hole perturbation theory.\nAs the expected end-state of most interesting blackhole simulations is a single spinning (Kerr) hole, the perturbative code implements the Teukolsky equation [49].\nThe Kerr metric in BL coordinates takes the form:\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u03a3\n2M r\n2\ndt2 + dr2 + \u03a3 d\u03b82\nds = \u2212 1 \u2212\n\u03a3\n\u2206\n\u03a9\n4\na\nM\nr\n+ sin2 \u03b8 d\u03c62 \u2212\nsin2 \u03b8 dt d\u03c6, (2.3)\n\u03a3\n\u03a3\nwhere \u03a9 \u2261 \u039b \u03a3 + 2 M a2 r sin2 \u03b8, \u2206 \u2261 \u039b \u2212 2 M r, \u03a3 \u2261\nr2 + a2 cos2 \u03b8, and \u039b \u2261 r2 + a2 .

Here \u03c1 \u2261 ma la;b m\u0304b is a NewmanPenrose spin coefficient, and \u03a84 is a Newman-Penrose\nWeyl scalar, both calculated using the Kinnersley tetrad.\nIn the Newman-Penrose formalism [50], there are actually five complex Weyl scalars, formed from contractions\nof a null tetrad (la , na , ma , m\u0304a ) with the Weyl tensor:\n\u03a80\n\u03a81\n\u03a82\n\u03a83\n\u03a84\n\n\u2261\n\u2261\n\u2261\n\u2261\n\u2261\n\nCabcd la mb lc md ,\nCabcd la mb lc nd ,\nCabcd la mb m\u0304c nd ,\nCabcd la nb m\u0304c nd ,\nCabcd m\u0304a nb m\u0304c nd .\n\nThe asymptotic behavior of solutions to the Teukolsky equation is best expressed in terms of the so-called\ntortoise coordinate r\u2217 :\n2\nr+\n+ a2\nr 2 + a2\nr \u2212 r+\nr \u2212 r\u2212\nln\nln\n\u2212 \u2212\n,\nr+ \u2212 r\u2212\n2M\nr+ \u2212 r\u2212\n2M\np\n\u2261 M \u00b1 M 2 \u2212 a2 .\n(2.6)\n\nr\u2217 = r +\nr\u00b1\n\nThe point r\u2217 = 0 roughly corresponds to the location of\nthe maximum of the Kerr solution's scattering potential\nbarrier (see, for example, Eqn (415) and preceding material in Chap. 8 of [52]). For this reason, it should not be\ncrucial to obtain initial data for the Teukolsky equation\nall the way down to the horizon (r = r+ \u21d2 r\u2217 = \u2212\u221e),\nas long as we have data for some r\u2217 < 0.\nThus to perform the Teukolsky evolution of radiative\ndata that corresponds to the late-time evolution of our\n3+1 initial data, we must identify the parameters (M, a)\nof the Kerr background, and calculate the radiative Weyl\nscalar \u03a84 using the Kinnersley tetrad. Estimation of\nthe physical parameters can be performed fairly reliably\nthrough identification of physical invariants such as the\napparent horizon and ADM mass or correcting (iteratively) the initial data parameters by the radiative losses.\nEvaluating \u03a84 using the correct tetrad is less straightforward.\nA.\n\nTetrad Choice\n\nIn BL coordinates, the Kinnersley null tetrad takes the\nform [53]:\n~lKin = 1 [\u039b, \u2206, 0, a] ,\n\u2206\n1\n[\u039b, \u2212\u2206, 0, a] ,\n~nKin =\n2\u03a3 \u0014\n\u0015\ni\n1\ni a sin \u03b8, 0, 1,\nm\n~ Kin = \u221a\n.\nsin \u03b8\n2\u03b6\n\n(2.7)\n\nUsing this tetrad, the spin coefficient \u03c1 takes the form:\n(2.5)\n\nThe \u03a8i encode all the vacuum curvature information\nof the Weyl tensor. As space-time scalars, they are\ncoordinate-independent; however they do depend on the\nparticular null tetrad used. With an appropriate tetrad,\nin weak-field regions, the interpretation of the \u03a8i is as follows: \u03a82 embodies the \"monopole\" non-radiative gravitational field; \u03a81 and \u03a83 contain the longitudinal radiative degrees of freedom (ingoing and outgoing, respectively), while \u03a80 and \u03a84 contain the physical transverse\nradiative degrees of freedom (ingoing and outgoing, respectively) [51]. For a numerical space-time that contains a Kerr hole plus perturbative gravitational waves,\n\u03a84 should contain only the appropriate outgoing radiation.\n\n\u03c1 = (r \u2212 i a cos \u03b8)\u22121 = 1/\u03b6\u0304.\n\n(2.8)\n\nHowever, the BL coordinates will not, in general, coincide with the numerical coordinates used in the full 3+1\nevolution. We can address this issue in a post-processing\nstep after the evolution, but we must still extract enough\ncurvature information to construct \u03a8Kin\n4 . Rather than\noutput all the components of the Weyl tensor Cabcd , it\nis more efficient to calculate the Weyl scalars with a numerically convenient tetrad, and transform the results to\nthe Kinnersley values during post-processing.\nThe simpler tetrad we use during evolution is a symmetric null tetrad constructed from the unit hypersurface normal \u03c4\u0302 and a set of three orthonormal unit spatial\nvectors \u00ea(1) = \u00ea\u03b8 , \u00ea(2) = \u00ea\u03c6 , \u00ea(3) = \u00ear , suitably orthonormalized via a Gram-Schmidt procedure:\n~lnum \u2261 \u221a1 (\u03c4\u0302 + \u00ea(3) ) , ~nnum \u2261 \u221a1 (\u03c4\u0302 \u2212 \u00ea(3) ),\n2\n2\n\n\f4\n1\nm\n~ num \u2261 \u221a (\u00ea(1) + i\u00ea(2) ).\n2\n\n(2.9)\n\nSimilar tetrads have been commonly used in radiation\nextraction from 3+1 numerical investigations [32, 33, 54,\n55], and such a tetrad was used in the earliest investigations of the asymptotic radiative degrees of freedom of\nthe Weyl tensor [51]. If we have long-lived 3D numerical\nevolutions, whose physical domain extends far from the\nstrong-field region, the \u03a84 extracted should yield a good\nmeasure of the actual outgoing gravitational radiation.\nWe will refer to (2.9) hereafter as the numerical tetrad;\nexplicit formulas for the Kerr-BL Kinnersley tetrad are\ngiven in (A1).\n\nB.\n\nReconstructing Boyer-Lindquist Coordinates\n\nThe reconstruction of the BL coordinates (t, r, \u03b8, \u03c6) is\nhighly non-trivial. We approach the problem via the following ad hoc steps:\n(i). assume no polar coordinate distortion;\n(ii). assume that with maximal slicing, numerical time\napproaches Boyer-Lindquist time;\n(iii). derive the radial coordinate from the equatorial\nvalue of numerical I;\n(iv). add a radius-dependent correction to the numerical azimuthal coordinate that zeros out the offdiagonal three-metric component \u03b3r\u03c6 .\nIn short:\n\u03b8BL = \u03b8num ,\ntBL = tnum ,\nrBL =\n\n3 M 2 /I\n\n\u03c6BL \u2212 \u03c6num = \u03c6offset =\n\n(2.10)\n(2.11)\n\u00011/6\n\nZ\n\n(\u03b8BL =\u03c0/2)\n\n,\n\n(2.12)\n\nr\n\n\u22126 A2 \u03a8num\n\u2212 4 i A (D + 1) \u03a8num\n2\n3\n\u0003\n/(4 FA2 FB2 ),\n+(D + 1)2 \u03a8num\n4\n\n(2.15)\n\n\u221a\nwhere D \u2261 A2 + 1.

For instance, we have no\nguarantee that there is no angular distortion between the\nnumerical and BL radial coordinates (although studies\nof post-merger apparent horizons have noted a definite\ntendency of the horizon shape to circularize in numerical\ncoordinates).\n\n\f5\nAn even bolder assumption is that maximal slicing\nwill yield a late-time lapse with the Kerr-BL shape.\nThe Kerr-BL lapse satisfies the maximal slicing equation;\nhowever, the numerical lapse also depends on the boundary conditions. In practice, we use Dirichlet boundary\nconditions, with values equal to that of the Schwarzschild\nlapse (M = 1) at the same coordinate position. This\nchoice will give us a lapse shape (and hence numerical\ntime) qualitatively like Kerr-BL; however we only have\nexperimental quantitative experience with the quality of\nthe fit. It can be shown for instance that the numerically\nobtained lapse quickly takes the form of the BL lapse\nover points in the exterior of the horizon; the greatest\ndeviations occur within the \"potential barrier\" at r\u2217 . A\nplot demonstrating this for evolved QC0 binary data is\nshown in Fig. 6 of Paper I.\nA complete and unambiguous solution of the coordinate problem is not yet available. Until it is, it seems\nsensible to work to minimize Lazarus's coordinate dependence. One obvious area to address is the transformation (2.15) of the curvature from numerical to Kinnersley\ntetrad; the numerical Weyl scalars are both mixed and\nscaled by coordinate-dependent factors. An improvement\nhas been made possible by evaluating the Weyl scalars\ninstead with the quasi-Kinnersley tetrad, which is the\nsubject of the next section.\n\nIII. LAZARUS WITH THE\nQUASI-KINNERSLEY FRAME\n\nIn this section, we review some recent results on transverse frames in numerical space-times, and discuss how\nthey can be used to develop new techniques to improve\nthe Lazarus procedure described in Section II. The main\naim is to move closer to the calculation of the actual Kinnersley tetrad during the full 3+1 evolution, and thus to\nminimize the need for ad hoc coordinate and tetrad correction schemes.\n\nA.\n\nTransverse Frames and the Quasi-Kinnersley\nFrame\n\nThe Kinnersley tetrad on a Kerr background is transverse \u2013 when calculated with this tetrad, the \"longitudinal\" Weyl scalars \u03a81 and \u03a83 vanish. This continues to\nhold for the non-trivial situation of a Kerr hole plus perturbing radiation. However, the coordinate and slicing\nambiguity of a generic numerical space-time, even when\nonly perturbatively different from Kerr, mean that this\ntetrad can be difficult to identify. The Lazarus tetradtransformation procedure outlined in the previous section\nwill not, in general, yield a transverse tetrad.\nA way of identifying transverse tetrads is through finding the eigen-bivectors of the self-dual Weyl tensor Cabcd\n[41] (see also Chapter 4 of [56]). When expressed in\na 3+1 decomposition, the Weyl tensor is projected to\n\nCac \u2261 Cabcd \u03c4 b \u03c4 d , and the eigen-equation becomes\nC ac \u03c3 c \u2261 (E ac \u2212 i B ac ) \u03c3 c = \u03bb \u03c3 a ,\n\n(3.1)\n\nwhere E ab and B ab are the so-called electric and magnetic\nparts of the Weyl tensor [54, 57]. This can be recast by\nprojecting the Weyl tensor onto the orthonormal triad\n{\u00ea(i) }: following [56], we can write (summation is implied\nover parenthetical indices):\nCac = Q(i)(j) e(i)a e(j)c ,\n\u03c3 a = V(i) ea(i) ,\n\n(3.2)\n(3.3)\n\nwhere Q(i)(j) is a symmetric complex 3 \u00d7 3 matrix whose\ncomponents are:\nQ(1)(1)\nQ(1)(2)\nQ(2)(2)\nQ(2)(3)\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\n\u2212\u03a82 + (\u03a80 + \u03a84 )/2,\ni(\u03a80 \u2212 \u03a84 )/2 , Q(1)(3) = \u03a83 \u2212 \u03a81 ,\n\u2212\u03a82 \u2212 (\u03a80 + \u03a84 )/2,\n(3.4)\n\u2212i(\u03a81 + \u03a83 ) , Q(3)(3) = 2\u03a82 ,\n\nand the \u03a8i are calculated using the symmetric tetrad\n(2.9). Then the eigen-equation (3.1) reduces to\nQ(i)(j) V(j) = \u03bb V(i) .\n\n(3.5)\n\nThe three eigenvalues \u03bb of the matrix Q(i)(j) label three\ntransverse frames; the corresponding eigenvectors give\nthe principal directions of the space-time. One of the \u03bb\nis preferred - it will be analytic near the point S = 1\nin the complex S-plane. The frame related to this \u03bb\nis called the quasi-Kinnersley frame. The preferred \u03bb\nwill be numerically equal to 2 \u00d7 \u03a8Kin\n2 , the value of the\nmonopole Weyl scalar as calculated with the Kinnersley\ntetrad.\nBeetle et al. [41] have described the analytic determination of the Weyl eigenvalues. In practice, establishing\nanalyticity of the the eigenvalues is not necessary numerically \u2013 Mars [58] has pointed out that close to Kerr, the\neigenvalue with the largest complex norm will give the desired frame; this conclusion has been made more secure\nby [41], who have shown that this is a valid conclusion\neverywhere in the disc kS \u2212 1k < 1. Instead of following\nthe analytic route, therefore, we use the LAPACK routine zgeev [59] to determine numerically the eigenvalues\nand eigenvectors of Q(i)(j) . We select the largest-modulus\neigenvalue as the appropriate (quasi-Kinnersley) one.\n\nB.\n\nTetrad Reconstruction\n\nBeetle et al. [41] lay out a procedure for constructing\na tetrad (la , na , ma , m\u0304a )qK in the quasi-Kinnersley frame\nfrom the eigenvector V(i) : first construct \u03c3 a from (3.3);\nnormalize it so that k ~\u03c3 k= 1; separate into real and\nimaginary parts: \u03c3 a = xa + i y a ; construct a third orthogonal vector z a = \u03b5abc xb y c ; then the new null tetrad\n\n\f6\nvectors are:\n~lqK\n~nqK\nm\n~ qK\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\n~x + ~z\n|c|\n,\n(3.6)\nk ~x k \u03c4\u0302 +\n= \u221a\nk ~x k\n2\n\u0012\n\u0013\n|c|\u22121\n\u2212~x + ~z\n= \u221a\nk ~x k \u03c4\u0302 +\n,\n(3.7)\nk ~x k\n2\n!\nei \u03c7 p\n(~z \u2212 i~y)\n, (3.8)\n= \u221a\nk ~x k2 \u22121 \u03c4\u0302 + p\n2\nk ~x k2 \u22121\n\nwhere c \u2261 |c| ei \u03c7 is an arbitrary spin-boost parameter.\nWe take |c| = 1, \u03c7 = \u03c0/2, in order to produce a tetrad\nthat asymptotes to the original numerical tetrad at large\ndistances. The subscript \"qK\" will refer to this specific\nchoice of c from this point.\nIf it happens that the eigenvector\n\u03c3 a is identically real,\np\n2\nk ~x k= 1, k ~y k\u223ck ~z k\u223c k ~x k \u22121 = 0 (see Appendix\nSection B 3 for analytic examples in the \"close-slow\" limit\nof binary Bowen-York data). This is not a problem when\nconstructing ~lqK and ~nqK ; however Eqn (3.8) will now\nbe undefined. A valid complex null vector m\n~ qK can still\nbe formed in this case, by replacing the second term in\nparentheses by any linear combination ~a + i ~b of two unit\nspatial vectors orthogonal to ~x. Beetle et al. supply one\nsuch choice in Eqn (29) of [41]. However, the resulting\nm\n~ qK at this point will have real and imaginary components that may not match continuously to neighboring\npoints.\nIn a continuous domain, we could imagine evaluating\nm\n~ qK by taking a limit from neighboring points; on a numerical domain (especially in 3D), this is an impractical\napproach, as (i) it would necessitate knowing in advance\nwhich points would need to be interpolated, and (ii) we\nwould need a very dense numerical mesh to carry out such\nan interpolation. Additionally, there are cases where the\npathological points are not isolated, but cover the entire\ndomain. This is the case for Schwarzschild and BrillLindquist data. In such cases, no interpolation procedure\nis possible.\nFor these reasons, we use an alternative tetrad reconstruction procedure, one that avoids pathologies entirely.\nWe start by following the prescription of Eqns (3.6 - 3.7)\nfor the reconstruction of the real null vectors ~lqK and\n~nqK , as in [41]; these vary smoothly from point to point,\neven for pathological regions when k ~z k= 0.\nNext, we take the original numerical complex null vector and split it into real and imaginary parts: m\n~ \u2261\n~ + iY\n~ . Now starting from these vectors, orthonormalX\nize them according to a set of Gram-Schmidt-like steps.\nSince ~lqK and ~nqK are already correctly orthonormalized,\nthe remaining requirements are:\n~ * ~lqK = 0, Y\n~ * ~lqK = 0,\nm\n~ qK * ~lqK = 0 \u21d2 X\n~ * ~nqK = 0, Y\n~ * ~nqK = 0,\nm\n~ qK * ~nqK = 0 \u21d2 X\n~ *Y\n~ = 0, X\n~ *X\n~ = Y~ * Y\n~,\nm\n~ qK * m\n~ qK = 0 \u21d2 X\n~ *X\n~ +Y\n~ *Y\n~ = 1.\n~ qK = 1 \u21d2 X\nm\n~ qK * m\u0304\n\nThe last two equations combine to imply that:\n~ *X\n~ =Y\n~ * Y~ = 1/2.\nX\n\n~ =\nTo\u221aimpose these conditions, we begin with X\n\u00ea(1) / 2, and enforce the conditions in turn (note that\nsince ~lqK and ~nqK are null, the Gram-Schmidt procedure\nlooks slightly unusual):\n~ \u2192 X\n~ + (X\n~ * ~lqK ) ~nqK ,\nX\n~ \u2192 X\n~ + (X\n~ * ~nqK ) ~lqK ,\nX\nq\n~ * X).\n~\n~ \u2192 X/\n~\nX\n2(X\n\u221a\n~ = \u00ea(2) / 2, and enforce\nIn a similar manner, we take Y\n~ just before normalization.\northogonality to X\nIt can be seen that the real and imaginary parts of\n~ and Y~ , pass untouched through the\n(3.8), used as X\nGram-Schmidt steps above. The choice we make of beginning with the original m\n~ instead will mean that our\nfinal m\n~ qK differs from (3.8) by no more than a spin term.\nUnlike (3.8), the Gram-Schmidt procedure described can\nbe used everywhere in the numerical domain, and guarantees a smooth behavior moving between neighboring\nnon-pathological and pathological points.\nFollowing the procedure as outlined here exactly reproduces the quasi-Kinnersley tetrad for Kerr-BL, and\nbehaves well for Brill-Lindquist and Bowen-York-type binary data.\nC.\n\nSpin-Boost Fixing and the Kinnersley Tetrad\n\nThe tetrad obtained from this procedure will be transverse, and moreover, will be in the same transverse frame\nas the Kinnersley tetrad - differing only by a Type-III\n- or spin-boost \u2013 transformation. Such a transformation will leave the scalar \u03a82 unchanged, but will have a\nstrong effect on the radiative fields \u03a80 and \u03a84 , scaling\nand mixing polarizations.\nLacking an unambiguous and natural way to lock down\nthe spin-boost needed to obtain the Kinnersley tetrad\nfrom the quasi-Kinnersley frame member, we return to\nour knowledge of the Kerr background. It can be shown\nthat for Kerr-BL, the null tetrad produced from the correct transverse eigenvector (by following the construction\nin [41]) is\n~lqK = \u221a 1 [\u039b, \u2206, 0, a] ,\n2\u2206\u03a3\n1\n~nqK = \u221a\n[\u039b, \u2212\u2206, 0, a] ,\n2\u2206\u03a3\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u2212i\ni\n,\nm\n~ qK = \u221a\nia sin \u03b8, 0, 1,\nsin \u03b8\n2\u03a3\n\n(3.9)\n\nthat is, the new tetrad is related to the Kinnersley tetrad\n(2.7) via:\nr\nr\n2\u03a3~\n\u2206\n~lKin =\nlqK , ~nKin =\n~nqK ,\n\u2206\n2\u03a3\n\n\f7\n\u03b6\u0304\nm\n~ Kin = \u221a m\n~ qK .\n\u03a3\n\n(3.10)\n\nThis implies that the corresponding Kinnersley-tetrad \u03a84\ncan be obtained simply from:\n2\n2\n\u03a8Kin\n= \u03a8qK\n4\n4 /FA FB .\n\n(3.11)\n\nNote that this transformation, unlike (2.15) for original\nLazarus, does not involve any mixing of the Weyl scalars.\n\nD.\n\nSummary of the New Procedure\n\nThus the new Lazarus procedure involves the following\nsequence of steps:\n(i). construct at every point on the numerical grid a\ncoordinate null tetrad of the form (2.9);\n(ii). calculate the corresponding Weyl scalars \u03a8num\n, the\ni\ntetrad invariants I, J , and the speciality index S,\nwhich we monitor during the full-numerical evolution;\n(iii). construct the matrix Q(i)(j) (3.4), and find its\neigenvalues and eigenvectors;\n(iv). pick the eigenvalue \u03bb with the largest (complex)\nmagnitude;\n(v). use the corresponding unit-norm eigenvector V~ to\nform the principal (complex) spatial vector \u03c3 a \u2261\nV(i) ea(i) ;\n(vi). construct a new null tetrad according (3.6), (3.7),\nand the pathology-avoiding steps following;\n(vii). recalculate the Weyl scalars with this new tetrad;\n(viii). determine the BL coordinates from the numerical\nones via the transformations (2.10 - 2.13);\n(ix). use the transformation (3.11) to produce the\nKinnersley-tetrad \u03a84 and \u2202t \u03a84 ;\n(x). evolve the Cauchy data \u03c8 \u2261 \u03c1\u22124 \u03a84 and \u2202t \u03c8 using\nthe Teukolsky equation (2.4);\n(xi). extract the gravitational radiation information,\nsuch as waveforms and total energy radiated at different extraction times T .\nIn the above, only steps (i)-(vii) can be carried out in\nthe full-numerical evolution; step (ix) is a post-processing\nstep, as it still involves knowledge of the appropriate\nKerr background parameters (M ,a), and BL coordinates.\nWhile the new Lazarus approach outlined above does\nnot solve this problem, it reduces the dependence of the\nTeukolsky data on the tetrad choices, by reducing the\nnumber of functions that depend on the BL coordinates.\n\nIV.\n\nNUMERICAL EVOLUTIONS\n\nWe have applied the new transverse-frame-based techniques outlined above to three numerical regimes of increasing complexity: Bowen-York data for one spinning\nhole, Brill-Lindquist data for the head-on collision of two\nblack holes, initially at rest, and transversely boosted binary Bowen-York data, representing an \"Innermost Stable Circular Orbit\". Two of these data sets were already\ninvestigated in detail using the existing Lazarus approach\nin [13]; our new techniques should allow some additional\nestimate on their validity.\nThe results have been obtained from 3D evolutions performed with the standard ADM decomposition of Einstein's equations [60], together with zero shift and maximal slicing lapse. It may be objected that this combination of evolution systems and gauge conditions is not\nstate-of-the-art. More sophisticated and stable systems\nare in wide use at present, and we would certainly expect\nthem to produce much longer-lived stable full 3D evolutions. In particular, a new numerical-relativity framework (LazEv) has been successfully developed [61] and is\ncurrently available to the authors of this paper; it allows\nfor evolutions of black-hole binaries using higher-order\nfinite differencing, with the BSSN formulation of Einstein's equations and dynamical gauge conditions. Nevertheless, we have two reasons for using the \"ADM +\nmaximal slicing + zero shift\" combination: First, this\ncombination was that used for the original Lazarus tests;\nif we desire a fair comparison of old and new methods, focused on the new tetrad methods we have developed, use\nof more modern and stable evolution methods will only\nobscure the results. Second, the introduction of more sophisticated gauges will necessitate the reconsideration of\nthe the numerical-to-Kerr-BL coordinate transformation.\nIn particular, the use of other lapse evolution schemes\nmay lead to a lapse shape significantly different to the\nmaximal and Kerr-BL shapes. Also, the presence of a\nnon-zero shift vector will alter the azimuthal-angle relationship (2.13).\nWe carried out the coding and testing of the concepts\npresented here using the Cactus [62] framework. Postprocessing of the 3D data and subsequent Teukolsky evolution was done with stand-alone codes.\nIn these evolutions, we were also monitoring the appearance of a single merged black hole using the apparent\nhorizon finder AHFinderDirect [63].\n\nA.\n\nSpinning Bowen-York Data\n\nThe Bowen-York solution [64] representing a single\nblack hole with angular momentum J should resemble\n- once the Hamiltonian constraint has been solved - a\nsingle Kerr black hole with gravitational radiation on top.\nThe rotational symmetry of the solution about its spin\naxis (the coordinate polar or z axis) means that only radiation with m = 0 will be present, and that there should\n\n\f8\nSpinning BY hole, Re(S) along x axis\n\n1.02\n\nRe(S)\n\n1.01\n\n1\nT=0M\nT=2M\nT=4M\nT=6M\nT=8M\nT=10M\n\n0.99\n\n0.98\n\n0.97\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\nx/M\n\nFIG. 1: The real part of the S invariant along the x axis for\nSpinning BY data, at different extraction times T .\nSpinning BY hole\n-4.0e-05\nL2, M/12\nL1, M/12\nL2, M/18\nL1, M/18\nL2, M/24\nL1, M/24\n\n-6.0e-05\n\n-8.0e-05\nE/M\n\nbe no net loss of angular momentum through gravitational radiation. Some analytic treatment of this data is\npresented in the Appendix Section B 1, based on Gleiser\net al.'s perturbative analysis [65].\nIn an early numerical investigation of the suitability\nof such data for Lazarus, we evaluated this data - using a full-numerical solution to the constraints - and\nextracted the radiation content of the initial data via\nthe new Lazarus method. We found that for small spins\n(J/M 2 . 0.2), a spatial resolution of up to M/80 would\nbe necessary to identify unambiguously the leading-order\nreal (l = 2) and imaginary (l = 3) parts of the Teukolsky\nfunction. Such a resolution is not feasible for a unigrid\nrun, if the outer boundaries are to be outside the strongfield region. For this reason, we have used a larger initial\nspin for full-numerical simulations.\nThis data was implemented on the initial numerical\nslice in Cactus, with bare mass m = 0.858 MADM, and\n2\nspin angular momentum J = 0.553 MADM\n; after numerical solution of the Hamiltonian constraint, the ADM\nmass of the initial data was MADM = 1.0. To extend the\nphysical domain, we used a \"transition fisheye\" radial\ntransformation of the numerical coordinates [11]. The\nexplicit form we used in this paper can be found in Eqn\n(114) of [66], with parameters (a = 7, s = 2, r0 = 7);\nthis produced a physical radial extent of 33.6 M from a\nnumerical radial extent of 10.79M . We used three spatial resolutions - M/12, M/18 and M/24. Because the\nsolution below the x-y plane is trivially related to that\nabove the plane, we were able to evolve the upper bitant\nonly. The 3+1 simulation died due to numerical instabilities before 25 M of coordinate time at the coarsest\nresolution, before 19 M at the medium resolution, and\nbefore 18 M at the finest resolution.\nFor such a weak-field case, we expect the Lazarus techniques to be applicable from a very early time. An apparent horizon is already present in the initial data, and\nFig. 1 shows the value of the (real part of the) speciality\nindex S along the x axis outside the horizon, evaluated\nat several times in the evolution. At all times after the\ninitial slice, the deviation from the Kerr value of S = 1\nis at most \u223c 2%. Thus the spinning BY data should\ncertainly be within the linearized regime almost immediately. (Nevertheless, Lazarus results will be sensitive\nto how well the numerical space-time satisfies the coordinate assumptions of Section II B.)\nWe analyzed the evolved data with both the original\nand new Lazarus approaches. At every M of coordinate time evolution, the Weyl scalars were calculated\nusing both the original and new tetrads, then modedecomposed and saved to file. We post-processed this\ndata to produce the Teukolsky Cauchy data (\u03c8, \u2202t \u03c8),\nwhich was then evolved using a code that solves the\nTeukolsky Equation. The total extracted energy as a\nfunction of extraction time T is shown in Fig. 2. Between extraction times of 1M and 5M , we see an emittedenergy plateau at around 1.25\u00d710\u22124 M , common to both\noriginal and new Lazarus, with a deviation of \u223c 3.5% be-\n\n-1.0e-04\n\n-1.2e-04\n\n-1.4e-04\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\nT/M\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\nFIG. 2: Total radiated energy for Spinning BY data as calculated from original (L1) and new (L2) Lazarus methods, as a\nfunction of extraction time T .\n\ntween old and new values.\nWe would expect that once we have entered an energy\nplateau, we should remain there, at least until the radiation has left the outer boundary of the full-numerical\ndomain. However, for later extraction times, from 6M\nto 10M , we see a monotonic decrease in emitted energy,\nleading to a low point of \u223c 0.88 \u00d7 10\u22124 M , a drop of\n\u223c 30 %. This degradation is common to both original\nand new Lazarus.\nThis behavior may be an artifact of the underlying\nADM evolution system, or other aspects of the Lazarus\nprocedure; even for the relatively high spin chosen here,\nspinning Bowen-York is a weak source of gravitational\nradiation, and presumably extremely sensitive to details\nin the simulation.

The five curves represent five different extraction\ntimes in the energy plateau of Fig. 2.\n\nthe situation.\nThe level of emitted energy is consistent with the fullnumerical results shown in [67] and the perturbative\nresults of Gleiser et al.

Data of this type was studied in a perturbative form in Ref. [68]; based on the full-numerical results\navailable at the time, perturbative results overestimate\nthe total emitted energy for large separations. Qualitatively similar conclusions can be drawn using Misner\ninitial data [3].\nThe specific initial data chosen has two holes with\nequal bare masses m = 0.50 M , with a coordinate separation along the y axis of 2.303 M , yielding a proper\nhorizon-to-horizon separation of L = 4.9M , and no linear or angular momentum (this data set was referred to\nas \"P = 0\" in [13]). The symmetry of the problem allows us to use only the first octant of the numerical grid\nduring evolution. Otherwise, the grid extent and fisheye\ntransformation were identical to those for the spinning\nBowen-York case above.\nAgain, we evolved the initial data using the \"standard\nADM\" evolution scheme with maximal slicing and zero\nshift. The finest resolution run crashed due to numerical\ninstabilities before 20M of coordinate time. Nevertheless, a common apparent horizon was found at coordinate time t \u2248 8 M , and there is reason to believe that a\ncommon event horizon is present from t \u2248 3 M [69] and a\ncontinuous potential barrier surrounding the strong-field\nregion around even earlier. We show the evolution of the\nspeciality index S in Fig. 4. While deviations from unity\nare always large near the punctures, the overall deviation outside the eventual common horizon location have\ndropped to below 10% by T \u2248 8 M , indicating we have\nentered the linear regime.\nFig. 5 shows the total radiated energy from the Teukolsky evolution, as a function of the extraction time T for\noriginal and new methods, for the m = 0 (upper panel)\n\n\f10\nHead-On collision\n-1.0e-04\n\nTABLE I: Comparison of emitted E for Head-On collision.\nDirect results (r\u2217,obs = 7.46 M ) are from [61]. \u0112 and \u03c3E are\nthe mean and standard deviation from four plateau values.\n\n-1.5e-04\n\nSource\n\n|\u0112|/M\n\u00d710\u22124\n6.6\n6.827\n6.811\n\nE / M (m = 0)\n\n-2.0e-04\n\nDirect\nL1 (8 \u2212 11M )\nL2 (8 \u2212 11M )\n\n-2.5e-04\nL2, M/12\nL1, M/12\nL2, M/18\nL1, M/18\nL2, M/24\nL1, M/24\n\n-3.0e-04\n\n-2.0e-04\n\n-2.5e-04\nE / M (m = +2)\n\nHead-On collision, m=+2, Lazarus 2\n0.004\n\nM r Re[\u03a84] (r*=30M, \u03b8=0)\n\n-3.5e-04\n\n-3.0e-04\n\n\u03c3E /M\n\u00d710\u22124\n-\n0.446\n0.179\n\n0.002\n\n0\n\nT=7M\nT=8M\nT=9M\nT=10M\n\n-0.002\n\n-3.5e-04\n-0.004\n\n-4.0e-04\n\n20\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\nT/M\n\nFIG. 5: Radiated energy for Head-On collision as calculated\nfrom original (L1) and new (L2) Lazarus methods, as a function of extraction time T .

While the original Lazarus results reproduce\nwhat was seen in Fig. 5 of [13] - the radiated energy\nreaches a crude plateau between extraction times of 4M\nand 10M - the new-tetrad-produced energy reaches a\nlevel plateau only after 7 M . After this time, both methods agree well until 10 M , but with a noticeably more\nlevel plateau in the weaker m = 0 curve for the new\ntetrad.\nTable I compares the total energy calculated with old\nand new Lazarus with a direct-extraction energy taken\nfrom [61] (this extraction was from a rather close detector\nposition, r\u2217,obs \u2248 7.46 M ).

[70] investigated such data to first perturbative order, through Zerilli and Teukolsky schemes.\nThe emitted energy curves from the two methods diverge\nat the level J/M 2 \u2248 0.4\u22120.5, and this the authors take as\nthe limit of applicability of linear perturbative theory.

Thus\nLazarus extraction and evolution of Teukolsky data\nwould not appear to be completely justified at any time.\nNevertheless, [13] found a small plateau in the emitted\nenergy, indicating a range of extraction times where the\nsystem has effectively linearized prior to the simulation's\ncrash.\nFor this data, the Lazarus procedure was carried out\ninitially using a zeroth-order parameter estimate taken\nfrom the ADM energy and angular momentum of the\ninitial data: M = 1, a = 0.77. However, since the emitted energy and angular momentum were at the level of a\nfew percent of the total, the subsequent drop in background mass and spin might be significant. For this\nreason, we iterated the method with suitably reduced\nbackground mass and spin parameters: M = 0.974, and\na = 0.675/M = 0.693.\nTo demonstrate how quickly the system appears to relax to Kerr, we show in Fig. 7 the S invariant along the\nx and z axes. Along the z axis, S clearly takes time to\nsettle down, only uniformly falling within [0.5, 2.0] rather\nlate in the simulation, after T = 8 M .\nFig. 8 shows the emitted energy and angular momentum, respectively, for both original and new Lazarus\nmethods (the dominant m = +2 mode waveform is plotted for old and new Lazarus in Fig. 9 and Fig. 10,\nrespectively). The original Lazarus results can be found\nin Fig. 22 of [13] (note that the latter figure contains the\ntotal energy summed across m modes).

The two methods\nagree well for T \u2208 [7 M, 8 M ], but begin to diverge again\naround the time new Lazarus develops plateau values of\naround 1.1 \u00d7 10\u22122 M and 4.25 \u00d7 10\u22122 M 2 for the emitted\nenergy and angular momentum, in the mode m = +2, respectively. Working with the more time-resolved data of\nthe inserts in Fig. 8, we have identified the plateaus for\nold and new Lazarus, and calculated the means and standard deviations. We present these in Table II, along with\ndirect-extraction results (r\u2217,obs = 14.03 M ) from [73].\nWhile both old and new means differ from the directextraction figures, new Lazarus's plateau is flatter.\nBecause the QC0 data takes time to plunge to a single\nhole, the onset of linearization will be delayed relative\nto, for instance, the head-on case. The fact that the observed plateau does not persist for longer than \u223c 2 M is\na consequence of the instability of the the simple combination of \"ADM + maximal lapse + zero shift\" we have\nused in our full-numerical evolutions here. In this sense,\nQC0 + ADM is a \"marginal\" Lazarus case; to establish\nthe plateau unambiguously will require evolutions that\nlast for several more M . This will necessitate more advanced evolution systems and gauges, and is addressed\nin the Discussion below.\n\nV.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThe original Lazarus method was a successful synthesis\nof full-numerical and perturbative methods in numerical\nrelativity. It was responsible for the production of the\nfirst waveform for black-hole binary mergers and close\norbits, before these regimes were accessible to a complete\nfull-numerical treatment.\nWe have presented in this paper the first in a series\nof proposed improvements to the Lazarus method - improvements which will, we hope, make Lazarus more ambitious in its reach, and more rigorous in its grasp. The\ndevelopments herein have focused on the important area\nof tetrad determination. We can now obtain - in the\n\"real time\" of the full-numerical evolution - a transverse tetrad that will differ from the Kinnersley tetrad\nonly by a spin-boost.\nWe described in Section III how this new method\nof tetrad determination can be incorporated into the\n\n\f12\nQC0, m=+2, Lazarus 1\n\nQC0, m=+2\n-6.0e-03\n\n2e-02\nM r Re[\u03a84] (r*=31M, \u03b8=0)\n\n-8.0e-03\n\nE/M\n\n-1.0e-02\n\n-1.0e-02\n\n-1.2e-02\n\n-1.2e-02\n\n-1.4e-02\n\n1e-02\n\n2e-18\n\n-1e-02\n\n-1.4e-02\n\n-2e-02\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n11\n\nL2, M/12\nL1, M/12\nL2, M/18\nL1, M/18\nL2, M/24\nL1, M/24\n\n-2e-02\n\n-3e-02\n\nJ/M\n\n2\n\n-4e-02\n\n-5e-02\n-4.0e-02\n-6e-02\n\n-5.0e-02\n\n-7e-02\n\n-6.0e-02\n\n0\n\n8\n\n9\n\n10\n\n5\n\n3e-02\nM r Im[\u03a84] (r*=31M, \u03b8=0)\n\n-1.6e-02\n\nT=8M\nT=9M\nT=10M\n\n2e-02\n1e-02\n2e-18\n-1e-02\n-2e-02\n\n11\n\n10\nT/M\n\n-3e-02\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\nt/M\n\nFIG. 8: m = +2 radiated energy and angular momentum\nfor QC0 data as calculated from original (L1) and new (L2)\nLazarus methods, as a function of extraction time T .\n\nFIG. 9: The two polarizations of the m = +2 QC0 waveform for the original (L1) Lazarus method, evaluated at\n(r\u2217 = 31 M, \u03b8 = 0).\n\nLazarus project, eliminating the artificial mixing of\nmonopolar, longitudinal and transverse modes that was\nnecessary in original Lazarus. To test this new aspect, we\nhave applied it on the same footing as original Lazarus\n- to the short-lived ADM evolutions of three different\ntypes of black-hole data.\nOur numerical results with this method, reported in\nIV, have allowed us to test this mode mixing for the first\ntime. The good agreement between old and new methods\nfor the single Spinning Bowen-York and Head-On cases,\nwhere linearization is seen well before code break-down,\ncan be seen as a validation of the applicability of the original Lazarus mixing formulas; additional evolution time\nmay be needed to resolve the marginal case of QC0 data\nsatisfactorily. In contrast, the areas of difference - seen\nfor instance, before T = 7 M in Fig. 5 for the Head-On\ncase - indicate better where our assumption of linear deviation from Kerr may not have been justified. With this\nalternative path to the Kinnersley tetrad in Lazarus, we\nhave produced error estimates for the tetrad construction procedure; we can estimate the contribution that\nerrors in this procedure make to the overall uncertainty\nin Lazarus energies. It should be noted, however, that\n\nthis error is unlikely to dominate the total uncertainty\nin emitted energies. Comparison of Lazarus (both old\nand new) results with more direct extraction techniques,\nshown in Tables I and II, indicate that other important\nfactors must still be addressed. A reasonable estimate\nof theoretical error in waveforms will be needed for their\napplication to analysis of gravitational-wave detector signals in the future.\nFor the next stage in the Lazarus project, we plan to\nuse modern evolution schemes, such the one provided by\nthe LazEv framework [61], which are more stable and\naccurate than ADM. LazEv currently supports higherorder finite differencing for the BSSN formulation of Einstein's equations with the choice of several dynamical\ngauge conditions, and should allow for extended energy\nplateaus, extending from the time of first linearization of\nthe system until the time the radiation leaves the system.\nThis added full-numerical evolution time will aid in the\nunambiguous identification of the linearization time for\nmarginal cases such as \"QC0\" above.\nAt present, it is unclear how to relate Boyer-Lindquist\ntime to the numerical time developed with standard nu-\n\n\f13\nQC0, m=+2, Lazarus 2\n\nM r Re[\u03a84] (r*=31M, \u03b8=0)\n\n2e-02\n\n1e-02\n\n2e-18\n\n-1e-02\n\n-2e-02\n\nM r Im[\u03a84] (r*=31M, \u03b8=0)\n\n2e-02\nT=8M\nT=9M\nT=10M\n\n1e-02\n\n2e-18\n\n-1e-02\n\n-2e-02\n\n-3e-02\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\n120\n\nt/M\n\nFIG. 10: The two polarizations of the m = +2 QC0 waveform for the new (L2) Lazarus method, evaluated at (r\u2217 =\n31 M, \u03b8 = 0).\n\nmerical gauges. Maximal slicing was discussed in Section\nII E; future refinements of this may use analytic insights\ninto the late-time shape of the maximal lapse (see [74]\nfor work on maximal slicings of Schwarzschild). Commonly used dynamic slicings (e.g., \"1+log\" slicing) ensure a lapse function with the same qualitative shape,\nfalling smoothly off to unity at large distances. The exact\nshape will vary greatly in the near-field region, however,\nand this will affect both old and new Lazarus; this is an\ninteresting problem, which we hope to address in future\nwork.\nTreatment of the shift is decoupled from the lapse in\nthe Lazarus approach; the shift correction via adjustment of \u03c6 is independent of the slicing analysis. Corotating coordinates can already be accommodated with\nthis method. We expect to treat more complicated evolution shifts in a similar way.\nThe quasi-Kinnersley frame has further useful applications. For direct radiation extraction at a finite observer location in the 3D numerical grid. It also provides a closer interpretation in terms of radiation for 3dimensional visualizations. Originally one uses the nu-\n\nmerical tetrad to evaluate \u03a84 . In order to give this a\ndirect interpretation in terms of radiation, one implicitly assumes that the observer is sufficiently far from the\nstrong-field region that the background space is almost\nflat, and the numerical tetrad is a good approximation\nto Kinnersley.\nWith the quasi-Kinnersley frame, we can get much\ncloser to the true Kinnersley form at finite observer locations. This should supply us with a more robust waveform at distant locations, and allow us to approach the\nnear-field zone with greater confidence. While impracticable for short-lived ADM evolutions, modern evolution systems should produce several periods of directly\nextracted waveforms at different extraction radii. Outerradius waveforms may be compared with Lazarus results;\ninner waveforms may be compared with outer ones as a\ntest of the quality of strong-field waveforms in general.\nAside from the longer full-numerical evolution times,\nwe plan to investigate further several issues to improve\nthe generality of Lazarus.\nThe transformations used to extract Boyer-Lindquist\ncoordinates from the numerical ones perform well, but\nthere is much room for improvement. One obvious -\nand theoretically well-founded - step that can be taken\nis relaxing the assumption that there is a one-to-one relationship between the numerical radial coordinate Rnum\nand the Boyer-Lindquist r. Since we know the theoretical form of the invariant I as a function of (r, \u03b8), we can\nimagine using I everywhere to derive both r and \u03b8. We\nhave performed initial investigations of this possibility,\nbut found that the off-equator radial transformation derived does not reach sufficiently close to the horizon, at\nleast for the most difficult cases, such as the QC0. Longer\nfull-numerical evolutions may improve the performance\nof this technique, as a horizon appears and circularizes.\nWe also plan to revisit the choice of the time slicing as\nthis might be crucial to process longer-term fully nonlinear evolutions.\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe authors gratefully acknowledge the support of the\nNASA Center for Gravitational Wave Astronomy at The\nUniversity of Texas at Brownsville (NAG5-13396), and\nNSF grants PHY-0140326 and PHY-0354867.
