Introduction\nConsider a 'macroscopic' fundamental superstring wrapping p times around a circle of radius R\nin the limit of large radius. Some spatial directions transverse to the string could be compactified\non a torus and the remaining are noncompact. In this case, the worldsheet theory living on such\na macroscopic string is particularly simple. For a string winding the circle once, this theory\nconsists of free bosons and free fermions corresponding to the transverse oscillations of the string.\nAs long as the energy scales of excitations are much smaller compared to the string scale, the\nmacroscopic string cannot break up or emit smaller loops of string. At very weak coupling,\nthese low energy excitations along the string are expected to decouple from the surrounding\nsupergravity fields. Moreover, the free worldsheet theory is manifestly superconformal. These\nobservations raise the question if a fundamental macroscopic superstring could be interpreted\nas a hologram of some bulk dual theory.\nTo find the holographic dual, one could examine how the spacetime geometry is modified\nby the backreaction of the string. The supergravity solution corresponding to such an infinitely\nextended fundamental superstring was found in [1, 2] using the two-derivative string effective\naction. A fundamental superstring is in many ways the most basic 'solitonic' object in string\ntheory and this solution is the most elementary brane solution in string theory. Indeed, all other\np-brane solutions can be constructed from it simply by applying T and S duality transformations\nto the supergravity fields.\nA characteristic property of this solution in all dimensions is that near the core of the\nstring, the effective string coupling gs2 determined by the local value of the dilaton field goes\nto zero. This suggests that even after taking into account the backreaction, the worldsheet\nwould continue to decouple from the bulk. On the other hand, the string metric near the core\nis singular and the curvatures become of the order of the string scale. This suggests that it\nwould be necessary to take into account higher derivative terms in the tree-level string effective\naction to fully analyze the 'geometry' near the core. In fact, since the curvature is of the order\nof the string scale, corrections arising from various higher derivative terms would be equally\nimportant and an exact CFT description would be necessary. One might hope that after taking\ninto account the corrections to the geometry to all orders in \u03b1\u2032 expansion of the tree level\neffective action and possibly exactly by using some bulk worldsheet conformal field theory, it\nwould be possible to obtain the holographic dual of the fundamental string hologram.\nFurther support for this idea comes from the investigations of higher derivative corrections\nto the 'geometry' and entropy of what have been termed 'small' black holes [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10].\nIf we take the radius R of the circle along which the string is wrapping to be very small instead\nof very large, then one can view the string as a point-like object in one lower dimension. The\nstring can carry in addition some quantized momentum q along the internal circle. In this case,\none obtains a BPS point-like object with two charges q and p. From the perturbation analysis\n\n\u20132\u2013\n\n\f\u221a\nof the spectrum one finds that they have exponentially large degeneracy that goes as exp (c pq)\n\u221a\nas a function of the two charges where the constant c equals 4\u03c0 for heterotic strings and 2\u03c0 2\nfor Type-II strings in all dimensions. It is natural to ask then if there is a two-charged BPS\nblack hole whose entropy corresponds to the degeneracy of these microscopic states similar to\nthe three-charge case [11].\nThis expectation is indeed borne out in a number of examples with a beautiful consistency\nbetween the macroscopic and microscopic aspects of the theory. The best studied examples\nare the heterotic small black holes in four dimensions with N = 4 supersymmetry. These\nblack holes were analyzed using certain F-type four-derivative supersymmetric corrections to\nthe effective action which depend on a particular quadratic contraction of the Riemann tensor.\nThis analysis reveals that upon inclusion of these \u03b1\u2032 corrections, the geometry near the core is\nno longer singular but is of the form AdS2 \u00d7 S1 \u00d7 S2 . The sphere S2 has radius of order one in\nstring units and can be regarded as the 'horizon' of this extremal small black hole. The dilaton\n\u221a\nno longer vanishes at the core and the four-dimensional string coupling g42 \u223c 1/ pq is now\nsmall but finite. As a result, the area of the horizon measured in units of the four dimensional\n\u221a\nPlanck length is large and scales as pq. The resulting entropy, incorporating the modifications\ndue to Wald [12, 13, 14] to the Bekenstein-Hawking formula [15, 16], is in perfect agreement\nwith the microscopic degeneracy including the precise numerical coefficient.\nInclusion of other higher derivative corrections is expected to correct the geometry further.\nMoreover, in string theory, the metric, like all other fields, is subject to field redefinitions.\nGeometric notions at the string scale determined by a given metric are not invariant under\nsuch field redefinitions. What makes the above analysis tractable and reliable is the fact that\nthe Wald entropy of a black hole is a much more robust physical quantity than the 'geometry'\nof the horizon. To begin with, for these black holes, the absolute degeneracy of these states\nequals a topological index given by a helicity supertrace [9, 8, 7, 10]. Furthermore, the system\n1\ncan be analyzed from a five-dimensional point of view. The\np radius of the circle S of the near\nhorizon region gets attracted to the near horizon value of q/p in string units irrespective of the\nasymptotic value R of the radius. The AdS2 and the S1 factor can then be combined into a fiber\nbundle as an AdS3 with possible global identifications which could be viewed as the near horizon\nregion of a small black string1 . Using the larger symmetries of AdS3 in this set-up, the Wald\nentropy can then be related to the anomaly in the boundary R-current and in turn to the bulk\nChern-Simons terms [17, 18]. These are already included in the four-derivative action and are\nnot further corrected by other higher derivative terms. Thus the Wald entropy computed from\nthe five-dimensional four-derivative supersymmetric action is determined entirely by symmetries\nand anomalies under the reasonable assumption that the near horizon region continues to have\nthe symmetries of AdS3 even after including all higher derivative corrections. This reasoning\n1\n\nThe extent of the string can be infinite and only its thickness is 'small' given by the string scale horizon. It\nis perhaps more accurate to call it a 'thin' black string.\n\n\u20133\u2013\n\n\fexplains why analysis of the four derivative action is adequate for computing certain quantities\nsuch as the Wald entropy. One can also show explicitly using the entropy function formalism\n[6] that includes higher curvature terms that Wald entropy is invariant under field redefinitions\nbarring singular ones that take AdS3 \u00d7 S2 to a singular space2 .\nOne can actually go further and compare even subleading corrections to the statistical\n\u221a\nentropy in an asymptotic expansion in 1/ pq. The subleading corrections to thermodynamic\nquantities are of course ensemble dependent, but there are finite possibilities to choose from\nwhich can be compared with the microscopic counting to determine which is the correct one.\nThe microscopic counting of these states is exact since it can be done in string perturbation\ntheory. For the macroscopic analysis, one can use the ensemble proposed in [19] or in [8] with an\nappropriate measure [20, 21]. One then finds that the macroscopic entropy and the microscopic\nentropy are in striking agreement to all orders in an asymptotic expansion which is governed\nby the same associated Bessel function. Since the asymptotic expansion is determined entirely\nby the saddle point quantities, this comparison is independent of subtleties having to do with\nthe choices of contours for inverse Laplace transform that enters the definition of the ensemble.\nIt is nontrivial that the same associated Bessel function appears in the two analyses that are\na priori completely unrelated. Such a comparison of macroscopic and microscopic entropies to\nall orders constitutes a nontrivial check of the consistency of string theory.\nEven though the agreement between the microscopic counting with the Wald entropy is\nbest understood for heterotic small black holes in four dimensions and the corresponding string\nin five dimensions, there are strong indications that many aspects of the story are true in all\ndimensions and also for Type-II strings. A general scaling argument due to Sen [22] gives the\n\u221a\ncorrect dependence pq of the entropy on the charges in all dimensions [23] assuming that\nupon inclusion of the higher derivative corrections the geometry near the core has a black\nhole horizon. The precise numerical coefficient cannot be computed because the supergravity\nanalysis of higher derivative actions in higher dimensions is more complicated. The important\npoint though is that the scaling argument seems to work uniformly in all dimensions and for all\nsuperstrings because it only relies on tree level bosonic action for NS fields that is common to\nall string theories. The scaling argument can also be successfully generalized to the states with\nspin assuming that upon inclusion of the higher derivative corrections the geometry near the\n\u221a\ncore has a black ring horizon. The entropy in this case has the form pq \u2212 rJ with a correct\ndependence on the spin J and a dipole charge r in agreement with the microscopic counting\n[24, 25, 26].\nOne could elevate these observations to a general principle that corresponding to every\nsolitonic system in string theory which has a large entropy, there must be a solution realizing a\n2\n\nThese arguments based on anomalies also explain why keeping only the four-derivative action is not enough\nfor the small black holes in Type-II string since the gauge current is non-anomalous and is not useful to determine\nthe Wald entropy. We will explain these issues in some detail in \u00a72.2.\n\n\u20134\u2013\n\n\fblack object in the low energy effective action that has the same entropy. This would include not\nonly big black holes and black rings but also the small ones. The microscopic and macroscopic\nstructure of the theory can then be consistent with each other in a natural way. By the same\ntoken, and from the general experience in holography, one expects that any solitonic object with\na worldvolume theory which typically will be conformal in deep infrared must have an AdS\nholographic dual as long as gravity decouples from the worldvolume. This reasoning suggests\nthat corresponding to the worldvolume of the fundamental string, a holographic dual must exist\nin all dimensions.\n\nEncouraged by these general arguments and some of the successes, we examine in this paper\nthe idea of a fundamental superstring as a hologram, taking seriously the AdS3 symmetries of\nthe near horizon region. For reasons outlined above, we choose to be guided by symmetries,\nanomalies, and Wald entropy and refer to the string scale geometry only as a shorthand for\nsignifying the relevant symmetries. We find that these considerations lead us to a very tightly\nconstrained theory describing the worldsheet dynamics of strings in the bulk. This worldsheet\ntheory involves a noncompact WZW model SL(2)k=2 (and its heterotic counterpart) which gives\nus the correct entropy. Precisely for this theory, we find that the boundary (super)symmetries\nare realized in the bulk string theory.\n\nThe discussion is organized as follows. In \u00a72 we set up our conventions, review what is\nknown about small black holes, and list the expected global superconformal symmetries of the\nnear horizon region in this context containing an AdS3 factor. This raises a number of puzzles\nwhich we outline and resolve in the subsequent sections. In \u00a73 we consider the fundamental\nsuperstring as a hologram in the Green-Schwarz light-cone formalism. This analysis makes\ntransparent how the global superconformal symmetries could be realized in the hologram and\nwhich of them can be extended to local superconformal symmetries. We also discuss an unusual\nlight-cone gauge which is relevant for the comparison with the bulk dual. In \u00a74 we specialize to\nthe case of the five-dimensional, Type-II small black string and construct the dual bulk theory\nwith the symmetries of AdS3 \u00d7 S2 . In \u00a75 we repeat the analysis for five-dimensional heterotic\nsmall black strings. In particular, we construct explicitly the boundary symmetries from the\nbulk, compute the boundary entropy from the bulk, and show that these are in agreement with\nthe hologram. We conclude in \u00a76 with a discussion of conclusions, open problems, and outlook.\nThere a number of related works that have some overlap with considerations here [27,\n28, 29, 30, 31, 32]. We will comment on some relations to these works during the course of\ndiscussion.\n\n\u20135\u2013\n\n\f2.

We have defined\n\u03c3 \u00b1 = \u03c4 \u00b1 \u03c3. In addition, there are worldsheet fermionic partners appropriate for the heterotic\nor the Type-II string and leftmoving bosons H I with I = 1, . . . , 16 for the heterotic string that\nparameterize an internal torus of E8 \u00d7 E8 . The total action is subject to Virasoro constraints\nwhich we discuss in some detail later in \u00a73.\nNow consider a fundamental string wrapping p times carrying quantized momentum q along\nthe circle. We define dimensionless left-moving and right-moving momenta\nr\n\u03b1\u2032 q\npR\nqR,L =\n( \u00b1 \u2032 ).\n(2.2)\n2 R\n\u03b1\nIf we take the right-movers of the superstring to be in the ground state then this state is\nsupersymmetric and the mass M saturates the BPS bound\nr\n2\nqR .\n(2.3)\nM=\n\u03b1\u2032\nThe left-moving oscillation number NL of the transverse oscillations satisfies the Virasoro constraint\n1\nNL \u2212 1 = (qR2 \u2212 qL2 ) = pq,\n(2.4)\n2\nfor the heterotic string and\nNL = pq,\n(2.5)\nfor the Type-II string. There is a large degeneracy d(q, p) of such states since this constraint\ncan be satisfied by exciting various oscillations in many different ways. The statistical entropy\ngiven by the logarithm of d(q, p) goes as\n\u221a\n(2.6)\nc pq,\n\n\u20136\u2013\n\n\f\u221a\nwith c = 4\u03c0 for heterotic and c = 2\u03c0 2 for Type-II.\nIn the limit of large R for fixed q, this state can be viewed as an infinitely extended string\nthat will act as the source for various supergravity fields. Let r be the radial coordinate along the\nnoncompact directions r 2 = xi xi . The dilaton field \u03a6(r) in the (d + 2) noncompact dimensions\nis given by the transverse harmonic function\ne\u22122\u03a6(r) = 1 +\n\np\u03a9\nr d\u22122\n\n(2.7)\n\nwhere \u03a9 is a geometric factor. The metric in the string frame then takes the form\nds2 = e2\u03a6(r) (dx\u03bc dx\u03bc ) + (dxi dxi ) + (dxm dxm ),\n\n(2.8)\n\nand the nonvanishing components of the 2-form field BM N are given by\nB09 = (1 \u2212 e2\u03a6(r) ).\n\n(2.9)\n\n2.2 Small Black Holes, Scaling, and Near Horizon Symmetries\nTaking into account the higher derivative corrections is in general very complicated because one\nhas to solve higher order nonlinear differential equations. The task is greatly simplified using\nsupersymmetry. In four dimensions using the superconformal formulation of higher derivative\nsupergravity one can incorporate four-derivative F-type terms and find the BPS solutions [33,\n34, 35, 36, 37]. The solutions corresponding to two-charge heterotic BPS states discussed above\nare found to have a string scale near horizon geometry of AdS2 \u00d7S1 \u00d7S2 [3, 4]. This system can\nalso be analyzed from a five-dimensional point of view using the four derivative supergravity\naction of [38]. The corresponding small black string solution with an AdS3 \u00d7 S2 near horizon\ngeometry is discussed in [39, 40].\nThe main virtue of the four derivative action in five dimensions is that it already incorporates the gravitational Chern-Simons interaction and all terms related to it by supersymmetry.\nUnder suitable conditions which will be discussed in greater detail in \u00a72.3, one can determine\nthe Wald entropy of the black holes completely using symmetries and anomalies. The four\nderivative action is thus adequate to be able to draw reliable and useful conclusions about the\nentropy of the heterotic small black holes.\nThe attractor values of the dilaton and the radius are determined entirely in terms of\ncharges\nr\n1\nq\n1\n2\n2\ng5 = , g4 = \u221a , R =\n,\n(2.10)\np\npq\np\n\nwhere g5 is the 5d string coupling, g4 is the 4d string coupling, and R is the radius of the circle in\nstring units around which the string wraps. This shows in particular, that for large p, the near\nhorizon string coupling can be made arbitrarily small. One can therefore consistently assume\n\n\u20137\u2013\n\n\fthat the worldsheet of the fundamental string, which we will later interpret as the hologram,\ndecouples from the massless supergravity fields.\nLet us now list the symmetries of this near horizon solution for the heterotic small black\nstring. To start with, we expect to have the global symmetries of AdS3 \u00d7 S2 which are\nSL(2, IR)\u00d7SL(2, IR)\u00d7SO(3). We also expect a local conformal symmetry V irasoro\u00d7V irasoro\nfrom a Brown-Henneaux construction [41]. The string is a half-BPS state to start with so we\nhave eight unbroken global spacetime supersymmetries. Near the horizon, in the N = 2 formalism that we have used, the supersymmetry is enhanced to include 4 additional superconformal\nsymmetries. So we expect altogether at least 12 superconformal symmetries and possibly 16\nsuperconformal symmetries if the problem could be analyzed in a manifestly N = 4 formalism.\nIn the Type-II case, if a small black hole were to exist, we would expect at least 12 + 12 and\npossibly 16 + 16 superconformal symmetries.\nAs mentioned in the introduction, a general scaling argument suggests that a small black\nhole ought to exist in all dimensions [22, 23]. If a small black string were to exist in higher\ndimensions for IR1,1 \u00d7 IRd \u00d7 T8\u2212d compactifications with d = 3, . . . 8, we would expect possible\nnear horizon geometries that have symmetries of AdS3 \u00d7 Sd\u22121 \u00d7 T8\u2212d with d = 3, . . . , 83 .\nIf we assume that there is a left-moving Virasoro and a right-moving Virasoro as it happens\nfor the D1-D5 system, then we expect to have for the right-movers at least a global SL(2, IR)\nsymmetry. The supercharges must transform under Spin(d) \u00d7 Spin(8 \u2212 d) and so we are led to\nlook for a supergroup that contains the bosonic symmetry SL(2, IR) \u00d7 Spin(d) \u00d7 Spin(8 \u2212 d)\nand at least 12 and possibly 16 global superconformal supersymmetries4 . Possible supergroups\nthat contain sixteen supersymmetries are limited in number. The list of symmetries of heterotic\nsmall black strings with a possible supergroup containing them is summarized in the table (1).\nFor example, the group OSp(8|2) contains Spin(8) \u00d7 Sp(2) as a bosonic subgroup and the\nfermionic generators transform as vector of Spin(8) and a doublet of Sp(2) \u223c SL(2). Similarly\nOSp(4\u2217|4) contains SO \u2217(2, 2) \u223c SL(2) \u00d7 Spin(3) and Sp(4) \u223c Spin(5) as bosonic subgroups.\nSee [42] for a nice introduction to supergroups in this string theory context.\nThere are a number of puzzles that arise from these identifications of the supergroups for the\nglobal symmetries of the horizon. It is well-known that maximal allowed local superconformal\nsymmetries are given by an N = (4, 4) superconformal theory that has SU(2) R-symmetry\nboth on the left and on the right. This algebra of local currents has a closed subalgebra whose\nfermionic part consists of 8 + 8 = 16 global superconformal charges5 . How does one square this\n3\n\nThe case d = 2, although not considered here, could be relevant for studying small black rings in four\ndimensions if they exist.\n4\nWe would like to thank A. Strominger for valuable discussions pertaining to symmetries. See also [29].\n5\nFollowing standard convention, N = (0, 4) supersymmetry in two dimensions has four usual right-moving\nsupersymmetries. Together with the four additional superconformal symmetries, it has a total of eight global\nsupercharges.\n\n\u20138\u2013\n\n\fSpace\nIR8\nIR7 \u00d7 S 1\nIR6 \u00d7 T 2\nIR5 \u00d7 T 3\nIR4 \u00d7 T 4\nIR3 \u00d7 T 5\n\nHorizon Symmetry\nSpin(8)\nSpin(7)\nSpin(6)\nSpin(5)\nSpin(4)\nSpin(3)\n\nR Symmetry\nPossible Supergroup\nSpin(8)\nOSp(8|2)\nSpin(7)\nF (4)\nSpin(6) \u00d7 Spin(2)\nSU(1, 1|4)\nSpin(5) \u00d7 Spin(3)\nOSp(4\u2217|4)\nSpin(4) \u00d7 Spin(4)\nSU(1, 1|2)2\nSpin(3) \u00d7 Spin(5)\nOSp(4\u2217|4)\n\nTable 1: For heterotic compactifications of the form IR1,1 \u00d7 IRd \u00d7 T8\u2212d (d = 3, . . . 8), the expected\nglobal rotational symmetry of the horizon in various dimensions are listed here in the second column,\nand the global R-symmetries of the supercharges are in the third column. Possible supergroups that\ncontain these symmetries assuming 16 superconformal symmetries are listed in the fourth column.\n\nthe much larger global symmetries which for example require 16 + 16 = 32 supersymmetries for\nthe Type-II case? For these reasons, we will not commit ourselves to the supergroups in table\n(1) and regard them as a tentative identification. We will be guided instead by the holograms\ndiscussed in \u00a73 where it is easy to write down the symmetry algebras quite explicitly. The\nquestion of global and local symmetries is somewhat subtle even in the hologram and we shall\ndiscuss this issue in more detail in \u00a73. The usual global supersymmetries are easy to display\nbut the realization of global superconformal symmetries involves an analog of spectral flow. It\nis not possible to make all global and local symmetries manifest at the same time.\n2.3 Wald Entropy and Anomalies\nWe now briefly review the arguments that utilize the AdS3 symmetry and anomalies to compute\nthe Wald entropy [17, 18, 43].\nThe dynamics of the theory in this background will be governed by an effective three\ndimensional action, obtained by compactifying the remaining directions including the angular\ncoordinates of the horizon. This effective action will have the form\nZ\n\u221a\n(3)\n(3)\nd3 x \u2212 det G (L0 + L1 ) ,\n(2.11)\n(3)\n\nwhere L0 is a lagrangian density with manifest general coordinate invariance, and\ndenotes the gravitational Chern-Simons term:\n\u221a\n(3)\n\u2212 det G L1 = K \u03a93 ,\n\n\u221a\n\n(3)\n\n\u2212 det G L1\n\n(2.12)\n\n\u03a93 being the Lorentz Chern-Simons 3-form and K is a constant. The action admits an AdS3\nsolution\n\u0002\n\u0003\nds23 = L2 e2 (\u2212r 2 dt2 + r \u22122 dr 2 ) + (dy + erdt)2 ,\n(2.13)\n\u20139\u2013\n\n\fwhere L is an overall scale. We have written it in the form of a fiber bundle. The fiber is a circle\nwith coordinate y and the base is an AdS2 with coordinates (r, t) so that e can be viewed as\na unit of charge associated with the Kaluza-Klein reduction along y. One can then show, both\nin the Euclidean action formalism [17, 18, 44] as well as using Wald's formula [45, 46], that the\nentropy of the black hole with near horizon geometry described in (2.13) has the form:\nr\ncL Q\nSBH = 2\u03c0\nfor Q > 0 ,\n6\nr\ncR |Q|\nfor Q < 0 ,\n(2.14)\n= 2\u03c0\n6\nwhere Q is the electric charge associated with the Kaluza-Klein gauge field, and\ncR = 24 (\u2212g(l) \u2212 \u03c0 K) ,\n\ncL = 24 (\u2212g(l) + \u03c0 K) ,\n\ng(l) =\n\n1 3 (3)\n\u03c0 l L0 ,\n4\n\n(3)\n\nl = 2Le .\n\n(2.15)\n\n(2.16)\n\nL0 in (2.16) has to be evaluated on the near horizon background (2.13). This gives a concrete\nform of the Q dependence of the entropy in terms of the constants cL and cR .\nThe constants cL and cR given in (2.15) can be interpreted as the left- and right-moving\ncentral charges of the two dimensional CFT living on the boundary of the AdS3 [18, 17, 44].\nThe Kaluza-Klein momentum Q is interpreted as the momentum in this boundary CFT which\nis the (L0 \u2212 L0 ) eigenvalue of a given state in this CFT. The two cases in (2.14) correspond to\nL0 = 0 and Q > 0 or L0 = 0 and Q < 0. With these identifications, (2.14) can be interpreted\nas simply Cardy formula in this CFT. This argument can be summarized by saying that Wald\nentropy of the bulk equals the Cardy entropy of the boundary.\nIf the theory has at least N = (0, 2) supersymmetry then one can actually do more and\ndetermine even cL and cR using anomalies. In our case the boundary theory will in fact have\nN = (0, 4) supersymmetry. In this case, the central charge cR is related to the central charge\nof an SU(2)R current algebra which is also a part of the N = (0, 4) supersymmetry algebra.\nAssociated with the SU(2)R currents there will be SU(2) gauge fields in the bulk, and the\ncentral charge of the SU(2)R current algebra will be determined in terms of the coefficient of\nthe gauge Chern-Simons term in the bulk theory. This determines cR in terms of the coefficient\nof the gauge Chern-Simons term in the bulk theory [18, 17, 43]. On the other hand from (2.15)\nwe see that cL \u2212cR is determined in terms of the coefficient K of the gravitational Chern-Simons\nterm. Since both cL and cR are determined in terms of the coefficients of the Chern-Simons\nterms in the bulk theory, they do not receive any higher derivative corrections. This completely\ndetermines the entropy from (2.14). Furthermore the expression for the entropy derived this\n\n\u2013 10 \u2013\n\n\fway is independent of all the near horizon parameters and hence also of the asymptotic values of\nall the scalar fields. Since this argument is quite general and three-dimensional, it is expected\nto work for higher dimensional small black strings as well with transverse space of the type\nSd\u22121 \u00d7 T8\u2212d as long as the Spin(d) symmetry couples chirally to bulk gauge fields [47].\nWhile the argument works beautifully for heterotic small black strings, it appears to fail\nspectacularly for Type-II small black strings. For instance, for Type-II on T6 , the F-type fourderivative terms are zero and hence to this order the horizon continues to be singular with a\nvanishing horizon and the resulting Wald entropy would appear to be zero. What is worse, if\nwe identify isometries of Sd\u22121 with the conformal R-symmetries then one would conclude by\nsimilar reasoning that cL = cR = 0 giving vanishing entropy in contradiction with microscopic\ncounting and the scaling argument.\nA correct interpretation of these results, as we will argue in the next two sections is that\nin the Type-II case, the geometric rotational symmetry of the horizon is nonchiral and does\nnot correspond to the conformal R-symmetry. There are additional chiral gauge symmetries of\nstringy origin which can be identified with the conformal R-symmetries both for the right and\nthe left-movers. The geometric symmetries of the horizon are a nonchiral linear combination of\nthese R-symmetries. This structure will be quite clear also from the hologram that we discuss in\n\u00a73. Now, the coefficient of the gravitational Chern-Simons term is proportional to cL \u2212cR which\nvanishes. The gauge Chern-Simons term in supergravity being nonchiral also couples to cL \u2212cR .\nTherefore, unlike the heterotic case, the Chern-Simons terms are not useful for determining the\nentropy6 . This means in particular that analyzing only the four-derivative action is not adequate\nto find the correct entropy but one must take into account all \u03b1\u2032 corrections as suggested by\nthe scaling argument. Application of the scaling argument will then tell us that entropy will\nhave the right dependence on charges but determination of the precise coefficient is intrinsically\nstringy and not easily doable in supergravity. This explains why small black holes and black\nstrings have been difficult to find in the Type-II case. Our stringy construction \u00a74 will give a\nway to compute this entropy using an exact CFT construction of the worldsheet.\nMany of these confusing issues are neatly resolved by looking at the holograms that we\nexpect for this system. We therefore turn next to the hologram for some guidance about the\nstructure of various symmetries.\n\n3. The Fundamental Superstring as a Hologram\nThere is a simple way to realize all the required symmetries expected for the near horizon of\na small black string using a free field representation which is furnished by the worldsheet of a\ntoroidally compactified Green-Schwarz macroscopic superstring in a particular light-cone like\n6\n\nWe would like to thank P. Kraus for explaining this point of view.\n\n\u2013 11 \u2013\n\n\fgauge. For our purposes, this specific free field representation is not only simple but will have\na direct physical interpretation as the boundary hologram. It is an instructive exercise to work\nout this representation in some detail. In particular, it will illuminate the role of global and\nlocal symmetries and will provide some guidance as to which of the global symmetries can\nbecome local conformal symmetries. We would like to regard all transverse oscillations as the\nfields along the worldsheet and also solve the Virasoro constraints. For this purpose it will be\nuseful to choose a slight variant of the usual light cone gauge using the compact X 9 direction as\none of the light-cone coordinates. We discuss this 'compact light-cone gauge' and the various\nresulting algebras in \u00a73.1. In \u00a73.3 we choose a further variation of this gauge by using one of\nthe internal compact directions to be the light-cone directions. This will prove useful for later\ncomparison with the bulk holographic dual.\nA theory of p identical strings has also a symmetry S p which permutes the different strings.\nThe full holographic theory is then a symmetric product of p strings. This is consistent with\nS duality which maps it to a theory of D-strings. In the bulk theory which we discuss in the\nfollowing sections, the corresponding statement is that there are states with non-zero values of\nspectral flow number in SL(2). In this section, we shall discuss the symmetries of the system\nfor which it is sufficient to consider the free theory of the transverse oscillations of the string.\n3.1 Holograms in the Compact Light Cone Gauge\nThe action of the superstring in the conformal gauge is subject to Virasoro constraints\n1\nint\nT++ = \u2032 \u2202+ X M \u2202+ XM + T++\n= 0,\n(3.1)\n\u03b1\n1\nint\n= 0.\n(3.2)\nT\u2212\u2212 = \u2032 \u2202\u2212 X M \u2202\u2212 XM + T\u2212\u2212\n\u03b1\nint\nint\nHere T++\nand T\u2212\u2212\nare the stress tensor components of the fermionic and internal coordinates\nwhich we discuss more explicitly later.\nWe would like to solve these constraints explicitly so that we have to deal with only the\ntransverse physical oscillations. For this purpose, it is useful to define the 'compact' light-cone\ncoordinates\n(X 0 \u00b1 X 9 )\n\u221a\nX\u00b1 =\n.\n(3.3)\n2\nIgnoring the oscillators, the zero mode expansion of the two fields X 0 and X 9 is given by\nX 0 = x0 + p0 \u03b1\u2032 \u03c4\nwR\nq\nX 9 = x9 + \u03b1\u2032 \u03c4 + \u2032 \u03c3\nR\n\u03b1\nWe now choose the following light-cone like gauge\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u03b1\u2032\nwR\nq\n+\n+\n0\nX = x + \u221a (p + )\u03c4 + \u2032 \u03c3\nR\n\u03b1\n2\n\n\u2013 12 \u2013\n\n(3.4)\n(3.5)\n\n(3.6)\n\n\fso that the X + coordinate has no oscillators. Note that this is different from a discrete light cone.\nSince the coordinate X 9 is compact, X 9 \u223c X 9 + 2\u03c0R, the light-cone direction spirals around\nthe cylindrical (X 0 , X 9 ) space but has infinite extent. As in (2.2), we can define dimensionless\nleft-moving and right-moving lightcone momenta,\nr\nwR\n\u03b1\u2032 0 q\n+\n(p + \u00b1 \u2032 ),\n(3.7)\nqR,L =\n2\nR\n\u03b1\nso that\n\nr\n\nr\n\u03b1\u2032 +\n\u03b1\u2032 +\n+\n\u2202+ X =\nqR ,\nq .\n\u2202\u2212 X =\n(3.8)\n2\n2 L\nThis allows us to solve the Virasoro constraints for the remaining longitudinal mode in terms\nof the transverse modes,\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u03b1\u2032 tr\n\u03b1\u2032 tr\n\u2212\n\u2212\n),\n(3.9)\n\u2202+ X = + (T++ ); \u2202\u2212 X = + (T\u2212\u2212\nqL\nqR\n+\n\nwhere the superscript tr refers to all spacetime and internal degrees of freedom that are transverse to (X 0 , X 9 ). The mass-shell conditions (2.3), (2.4), and (2.5) follow from identifying the\nFourier modes \u03b10\u2212 with qR\u2212 and \u03b1\u03030\u2212 with qL\u2212 . We see that in the limit of R \u2192 \u221e, in the zero\nwinding sector p = 0, this gauge reduces to the usual light-cone gauge. On the other hand,\nfor nonzero winding p 6= 0 and for fixed q, it resembles the static gauge which is what we are\ninterested in. Unlike the static gauge however, it has the virtue of the light-cone gauge that the\nVirasoro constraints are explicitly solvable7 . For the naive static gauge X 9 = \u03c3R, the Virasoro\nconstraints are quadratic in the X 0 oscillators and are difficult to solve at the level of quantum\noperators.\nSince all longitudinal degrees of freedom are now either gauge fixed or determined in terms\nof the transverse modes, we can focus on the physical transverse modes. Fermions can be\nincorporated in the usual way and we will use the light-cone Green-Schwarz formalism. The\ntransverse action for the Type-IIB superstring on IR1,1 \u00d7 IRd \u00d7 T8\u2212d compactification is given\nby\nZ\n1\nS=\nd\u03c3d\u03c4 (\u2202+ X i \u2202\u2212 X i + \u2202+ X m \u2202\u2212 X m + i\u03b1\u2032 S+a\u03b1 \u2202\u2212 S+a\u03b1 + i\u03b1\u2032 S\u0303\u2212a\u03b1 \u2202+ S\u0303\u2212a\u03b1 ),\n(3.10)\n2\u03c0\u03b1\u2032\nwhere i = 1, . . . , d transforms in the vector representation of Spin(d); m = d + 1, . . . , 8 transforms in the vector representation of Spin(8 \u2212 d). Similarly, for fermions, a transforms as a\nspinor of Spin(d) and \u03b1 as a spinor of Spin(8 \u2212 d). For uncompactified string, that is, the\nspecial case when d = 8, bosons transform in the vector representation 8v and the fermions in\n7\n\nA gauge-fixing of this kind was discussed in [48]. We thank Kostas Skenderis for bringing this to our\nattention.\n\n\u2013 13 \u2013\n\n\fthe spinor representation 8s of Spin(8). For the Spin(8) spinor and gamma matrices we follow\nthe conventions in Appendix 5.B of [49].\nThe group-theoretic structure of bosons and fermions for d < 8 is then determined by the\nembedding Spin(d) \u00d7 Spin(8 \u2212 d) \u2282 Spin(8). For example, for the Spin(3) \u00d7 Spin(5) case, our\nconventions are summarized in Appendix B. For Type-IIA strings, the action is similar except\nthat the left-moving fermions transform in conjugate spinor representation 8c of Spin(8). For\nheterotic strings, we do not have left-moving fermions but instead left-moving internal bosons\nH I ; I = 1, . . . 16 that live on an E8 \u00d7 E8 lattice.\n3.2 Symmetries of the Holograms\nWe would now like to view this theory defined by (3.10) as a hologram and in particular\nunderstand all its symmetries. Various global and local symmetries are very easy to work\nout because the computations are identical to those that appear in the first quantization of\nthe light-cone superstring. The physical interpretation of these symmetries here is however\ncompletely different. The theory given by the action above should be viewed as the 'second\nquantized' string field theory action of the strings moving in the holographically dual bulk\ntheory. Construction of the holographically dual worldsheet which we discuss in \u00a74 gives the\nfirst quantized realization of this symmetry algebra.\nWe consider here the special case d = 8 to simplify the discussion and also focus on only\nright-movers while discussing the chiral currents. The mode expansions of the basic fields are\nr\nr\n\u2032 X\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\u2032 X\n+\n\u2212\n\u03b1n e\u2212in\u03c3 , \u2202\u2212 X i =\n\u03b1\u0303n e\u2212in\u03c3 ,\n(3.11)\n\u2202+ X i =\n2\n2\nn6=0\n\nfor bosons and\nS+a\n\n=\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nn6=0\n\n+\nSna e\u2212in\u03c3 ,\n\nn=\u2212\u221e\n\nS\u2212a\n\n=\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nS\u0303na e\u2212in\u03c3 ,\n\u2212\n\n(3.12)\n\nn=\u2212\u221e\n\nfor the fermions. The oscillators satisfy the usual canonical commutation relations\ni\n[\u03b1m\n, \u03b1nj ] = m\u03b4m+n \u03b4 ij ,\n\na\n{Sm\n, Snb } = \u03b4m+n \u03b4 ab ,\n\n(3.13)\n\nand similarly for the left-movers. In addition there are bosonic zero modes xi and pi which\nsatisfy the Heisenberg commutation relations\n[xi , pj ] = i\u03b4 ij .\n\n(3.14)\n\nTo begin with, the action has a global Spin(8) rotational symmetries generated by J ij ,\nwhich we write as\nJ ij = Lij + E ij + K0ij + \u1ebc ij + K\u03030ij ,\n(3.15)\n\n\u2013 14 \u2013\n\n\fwith\nLij = (xi pj \u2212 xj pi ),\nX1\nj\ni\nE ij = \u2212i\n(\u03b1\u2212n\n\u03b1nj \u2212 \u03b1\u2212n\n\u03b1ni ),\nn\nn>0\n\n(3.16)\n(3.17)\n\ni X a ij b\nS \u03b3 S ,\n4 n>0 \u2212n ab n\n\n(3.18)\n\n1\ni\n(\u2202+ X i \u2202+ X i ) + S+a \u2202+ S+a\n\u2032\n\u03b1\n2\n\n(3.19)\n\nK0ij = \u2212\n\nand similarly for the contributions \u1ebc ij and K\u03030ij from the left-moving oscillators. Note that even\nthough the oscillator contributions are chiral, the piece Lij which depends on the zero modes\nxi and pi is nonchiral and as a result the rotation symmetry generated by the Jij is nonchiral.\nThis fact will be important later.\nIn addition to this global, nonchiral symmetry, there are a large number of local, chiral\nsymmetries. For the right-movers, we have the conformal symmetries generated by the spin-2\nstress tensor T (\u03c3 + ), supersymmetries generated by the spin-3/2 currents Q\u0227 (\u03c3 + ) as well as\nSpin(8) affine algebra generated by the spin-1 currents K ij (\u03c3 + ). These operators are given by\nT (\u03c3 + ) =\n\n1\n(3.20)\nQ\u0227 (\u03c3 + ) = \u221a (\u03b3 i )\u0227a S+a \u2202+ X i ,\n\u03b1\u2032\ni\nij b\nK ij (\u03c3 + ) = \u2212 S+a \u03b3ab\nS+ .\n(3.21)\n4\nThe index i transforms in the vector representation 8v of Spin(8), the index a in the MajornaWeyl spinor representation 8s of positive chirality, and the index \u0227 in the conjugate MajoranaWeyl spinor representation 8c of negative chirality and \u03b3ai \u0227 are the Clebsch-Gordon coefficients\nbetween these three representations. There are similar currents for the left-movers. In the\nheterotic case, one does not have the supersymmetries and the Spin(8) current algebra on the\nleft but instead the E8 \u00d7 E8 current algebra which contributes also to the stress tensor as usual.\nUsing the mode expansions of operators above and the commutation relations (3.13), it is\neasy to obtain the Virasoro algebra\n[Lm , Ln ] = (m \u2212 n)Lm+n +\n\nc\n(m3 \u2212 m)\u03b4m+n ,\n12\n\n(3.22)\n\nij\n[Lm , Knij ] = \u2212nKm+n\n,\n\n(3.23)\n\nwith central charge c = 12p8 , the commutators\n1\n[Lm , Q\u0227n ] = ( m \u2212 n)Q\u0227m+n ,\n2\n8\n\nFor a singly would string the central charge would be 12 but multiple winding is equivalent to having p\nspecies and hence the central charge becomes 12p.\n\n\u2013 15 \u2013\n\n\fand the Kac-Moody algebra\nk\u0303\njl\njk\nij\n[Km\n, Knkl ] = i\u03b4 ik Km+n\n\u2212 i\u03b4 il Km+n\n+ (m \u2212 n)\u03b4m+n (\u03b4 ik \u03b4 jl \u2212 \u03b4 jk \u03b4 il ).\n2\n\n(3.24)\n\nThere is in addition a nontrivial anticommutator [50],\n1\nij\n+ c\u0303(m2 \u2212 )\u03b4 \u0227\u1e03 \u03b4m+n ,\n{Q\u0227m , Q\u1e03n } = 2\u03b4 \u0227\u1e03 Lm+n + (m \u2212 n)(\u03b3 ij )\u0227\u1e03 Km+n\n4\n\n(3.25)\n\nwhere k\u0303 and c\u0303 are some constants. The modes of the supercurrent Q\u0227m transforms as a spinor\nunder the global rotations,\ni\n[J ij , Q\u0227n ] = \u2212 (\u03b3 ij )\u0227\u1e03 Q\u1e03n .\n(3.26)\n2\nIf we consider a toroidal compactification IR1,1 \u00d7 IRd \u00d7 T8\u2212d , we have noncompact coordinates\nxi ; i = 1, . . . , d and compact coordinates xm ; m = d + 1, . . . , 8. The toroidal identifications of\nthe compact coordinates xm breaks the rotational symmetry and we only have the Spin(d)\nsymmetry generated by Jij now with i, j = 1, . . . d. However, the chiral symmetries above work\nas before simply by decomposing the spinor indices of Spin(8) under Spin(d) \u00d7 Spin(8 \u2212 d).\nThere is an anomaly free subalgebra of the Virasoro algebra generated by (L0 , L1 , L\u22121 )\nand (L\u03030 , L\u03031, L\u0303\u22121 ) which generates the global SL(2, IR) \u00d7 SL(2, IR) which can be identified with\nthe isometries of an AdS3 . We also have the rotational Spin(d) symmetries generated by Jij\nwhich can be identified with the isometries of a spherical 'horizon' S d\u22121 . There are sixteen\nsupersymmetries (Q\u02270 , Q\u0303\u02270 ). In addition, there can be conformal supersymmetries which we will\ndiscuss shortly. These symmetries together already give us enough reason to consider this\nworldsheet theory as the hologram of the near horizon geometry of a small black string in\nd + 1 noncompact dimensions discussed in the previous subsection that we are after. Taking\nthis hologram seriously then predicts that the bulk theory must have not just these global\nsymmetries but also the local Virasoro symmetries on the left and the right as well as additional\nchiral symmetries which we now discuss.\nThe hologram also makes it transparent as to which symmetries can possibly be realized\nas chiral, local symmetries and which are only global symmetries. For example, it is clear that\neven though this algebra looks very close to a possible superconformal algebra of (8, 0) type\nwith a possible Spin(8) conformal R-current, this is not true. This is because the commutator\nij\nof Km\nwith Q\u0227n does not close and one obtains instead,\nX\ni\nij\na\nk\n[Km\n, Q\u0227n ] = \u2212 (\u03b3 ij \u03b3 k )a\u0227\nS\u2212r\n\u03b1n+m+r\n,\n4\nr\n\n(3.27)\n\nso we see that the right-hand side does not equal 2i \u03b3\u0227ij\u1e03 Q\u1e03m+n as one might expect if this were\nto form a closed algebra and if Q\u0227m were to commute as modes of a spinor operator under the\n\n\u2013 16 \u2013\n\n\fR-symmetry. The reason for this failure is of course obvious since the generators Q\u0227m commute\nas spinors only with the total angular momentum Jij and not if we consider only K0ij . More\nexplicitly, Q\u0227m defined in (3.20) contain terms that are proportional to pi which commute with\nK0ij and commute as a vector only when we take into account the orbital angular momentum\nLij .\nThis shows that even though we have a global Spin(8) R-symmetry that acts on the supercharges, it cannot be extended to a local, chiral conformal R-symmetry [51]. This is just as\nwell because otherwise one would obtain a closed N = (0, 8) superconformal algebra from the\ncommutators of (Lm , Q\u0227n , Klij ) with Spin(8) chiral R-symmetry. This would contradict general\ntheorems which state that the maximal allowed (right-moving) linearly realized superconformal\nsymmetry is N = (0, 4) [52, 53]. The failure of the R-symmetry to be chiral simply stems from\nthe fact that pi must transform under Spin(8) in order that Q\u0227m transforms as a spinor. This\nnecessitates the inclusion of the nonchiral Lij piece in the R-symmetry generated by Jij .\nThe action (3.10) does admit a N = (2, 2) and N = (4, 4) superconformal symmetry if we\nare willing to forgo the Spin(8) global symmetry. This fact is of particular physical significance\nin this context because it instructs us as to which of the symmetries of the near horizon of small\nblack string we might hope to realize simultaneously and which not. Moreover, the N = (2, 2)\nsuperconformal symmetry is the minimum that is required for us to be able to apply the KrausLarsen argument to obtain the Wald entropy correctly. We now like to exhibit this N = (2, 2)\nsuperconformal symmetry and in particular, display the 12 superconformal global symmetries\nfor the right-movers of which we have only seen 8 thus far, namely Q\u02270 .\nFor this purpose let us choose the embedding SU(4) \u00d7 U(1) \u2282 Spin(8) under which the\nspinor and the vector representations decompose as\n\u2212\n\n8s = 4+ + 4 ,\n\n\u2212\n\n8v = 4 + 4+\n\n(3.28)\n\nwhere 4 is the fundamental representation of SU(4), 4 its complex conjugate, and superscript\ndenotes the U(1). One can now define the local U(1) current J as\nJn = (Kn12 + Kn34 + Kn56 + Kn78 ) .\n\n(3.29)\n\nand the supercurrents\nG+ (\u03c3 + ) =\n\nr\n\n1 X a+\nS \u2202Xa\u2212 ,\n\u03b1\u2032 a\n\nG\u2212 (\u03c3 + ) =\n\nr\n\n1 X \u2212 +a\nS \u2202X\n\u03b1\u2032 a a\n\n(3.30)\n\nwhere we have suppressed the worldsheet spin index and use the notation that S a+ transforms\n\u2212\nas 4+ and Sa\u2212 as 4 etc. It is easy to check that these modes of these currents along with\nLm and Jn satisfy the usual N = 2 superconformal algebra. In particular in addition to the\n\n\u2013 17 \u2013\n\n\fVirasoro algebra (3.22), we have\n+\n{G+\nm , Gn } = 0,\n\n\u2212\n{G\u2212\nm , Gn } = 0\n\nc 2 1\n\u2212\n{G+\nm , Gn } = 2Lm+n + (m \u2212 n)Jm+n + (m \u2212 )\u03b4m+n ,\n3\n4\n[Jm , Jn ] = km\u03b4m+n .\n\n(3.31)\n(3.32)\n(3.33)\n\nNote that the anomaly in the current current commutator is proportional to k = 2p which is\nrelated to the anomaly in the Virasoro algebra c = 12p. To see the global OSp(2|2) algebra\n\u2212\n+\none has to use spectral flow and it is easy to check that (L0 \u2212 J0 /2, L\u00b11 , J0 , G\u00b1\n0 , G+1 , G\u22121 ) have\nthe desired commutations. We see from here that G\u00b1\n0 generate the usual supersymmetries and\n\u2212\n+\n(G+1 , G\u22121 ) generate the conformal supersymmetries.\nIt is useful to summarize this construction of N = 2 superconformal algebra using group\ntheory. We have chosen above two linear combinations G\u00b1 of the eight supercharges Q\u0227 , so\nthat they form a closed algebra with the Jn . The spinor Q\u0227 transforms under 8c . When the 8v\nand 8s decompose as in (3.28), the conjugate spinor representation 8c decomposes as\n8c = 12 + 1\u22122 + 60\n\n(3.34)\n\nWe are discarding 60 and keeping only 12 and 1\u22122 in the form of G\u00b1 . In the same way one\ncan use the decomposition SU(2)4 \u2282 Spin(8) and use one of the SU(2) as the conformal Rsymmetry. Choosing an appropriate combination of the eight supercharges that transform as\na doublet of this SU(2) and discarding others, one obtains a closed N = 4 superconformal\nalgebra. It is not possible to construct a conformal R-symmetry that is larger than SU(2)\nconsistent with the fact that N = 4 is the largest superconformal algebra that is allowed.\nWe can repeat this analysis for the other compactifications where the global R symmetries\nare Spin(d) \u00d7 Spin(8 \u2212 d). In all the cases, the full global symmetry cannot be extended\nto linearly acting local currents and the maximal local R currents possible is SU(2) which\ncorresponds to N = (4, 4) superconformal symmetry.\n3.3 Holograms in the Internal Light Cone Gauge\nWe now discuss a somewhat unusual gauge that is a slight variant of the compact light cone\ngauge. The reason for considering this particular gauge will be clear after our bulk construction\nof boundary symmetries in the next section. We will encounter there commutation relations\nbetween the Virasoro symmetries and the rotational symmetries that are somewhat unusual\nbut are quite natural from the point of view of the gauge that we call the 'internal light cone\ngauge'.\nLet us first consider the bosonic side of the heterotic string. This consists of bosons\nM\n{X , M = 0, .., 9} and {H\u0303 I , I = 1, .., 16}. Instead of picking the light cone gauge to be\n\n\u2013 18 \u2013\n\n\f(3.6), we define the bosons Y, Y =\nto be\n\n\u221a1 (X 9\n2\n\n\u00b1 H\u0303 1 ). We define the internal light cone coordinates\n\nY\u00b1 =\n\n(X 0 \u00b1 Y )\n\u221a\n.\n2\n\nand fix the internal light cone gauge to be\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1 q\nq\u2032\n1\n\u03b1\u2032\n0\n\u2032\n\u2032\n+\n+\nY = y + \u221a (p + \u221a ( + \u2032 )\u03c4 + \u221a (p .R + p .R )\u03c3 ,\n2\n2 R R\n2\u03b1\u2032\n\n(3.35)\n\n(3.36)\n\nwhere R\u2032 is the radius of the internal boson and (p\u2032 , q \u2032) are the winding and momenta along this\ninternal direction. The remaining transverse fields are {X i , (i = 1...8), Y , H m, (m = 2...16)}\nwhich we denote collectively by \u03c6a , (a = 1...24).\nAs before, we can define dimensionless left-moving lightcone momenta,\nr \u0014\n\u0015\n1 q\n\u03b1\u2032 0\nq\u2032\n1\n+\n\u2032\n\u2032\nqL =\np + \u221a ( + \u2032 ) \u2212 \u221a (p .R + p .R ) ,\n(3.37)\n2\n2 R R\n\u03b1\u2032 2\nso that\n\n\u221a\n\n\u03b1\u2032 +\nq .\n(3.38)\n2 L\nWe can solve as before the Virasoro constraints for the remaining longitudinal mode in terms\nof the transverse modes,\n\u221a\n\u03b1\u2032 tr\n\u2212\n\u2202\u2212 Y = + (T\u2212\u2212\n);\n(3.39)\nqL\n\u2202\u2212 Y + =\n\nwhere the superscript tr refers to all spacetime and internal degrees of freedom that are transverse to Y \u00b1 . In terms of modes, we have:\n!\n24\n\u221e\nX\nX\n1\n1\na\na\n:\u03b1\nen\u2212m\n\u03b1\nem\n: \u2212\u03b4n .\n(3.40)\n\u03b1\nen\u2212 = +\n2\nqR\na=1 m=\u2212\u221e\n\n\u2212\nen \u2261 q + \u03b1\nwhere \u03b1\nena are the modes of the fields \u03c6a . L\nL en obey the Virasoro algebra with cL = 24.\nSo far, everything went like in the usual light cone gauge quantization. But since we did\nsomething funny, there are certainly differences. Note that the SO(32) or E8 \u00d7E8 gauge currents\nof the heterotic string involve the boson H 1 . The manifest symmetries are therefore broken to\nSO(28) and E7 \u00d7 E8 . The SO(8) rotation symmetry on the other hand does not get enhanced\n\u2013 the new transverse oscillator Y cannot be rotated into X i because of the non-zero winding\naround X 9 .\nSince we expect the theory to be independent of choice of gauge, we expect that the full\ngauge symmetry is \u221aactually restored. The SU(2) \u2282 E8 symmetry would be generated by the\noperators \u2202\u2212 H\u03031 , e\u00b1i 2H\u03031 as before, except that these fields must now be expressed in terms of\n\n\u2013 19 \u2013\n\n\fthe appropriate transverse modes. We will not study this in detail for now, and simply note\nthe fact that the currents involving H\u0303 1 will no longer be good conformal currents under the\nconformal algebra described above. For example, the U(1) current generated by\n(Y \u2212 Y )\ne\nj(\u03c3 \u2212 \u03c4 ) \u2261 \u2202\u2212 H\u0303 1 = \u2202\u2212 \u221a\n2\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1 +\n1\n\u2212\n= \u2202\u2212\n(Y \u2212 Y ) \u2212 \u221a Y\n2\n2\n1 + 1\n1\n= pL \u2212 \u2202\u2212 \u03c6\u2212 \u2212 \u221a \u2202\u2212 Y .\n4\n2\n2\n\n(3.41)\n(3.42)\n(3.43)\n\nThe modes of this current\n\u21d2e\njn =\n\n1 Y\n\u03b4n0 + 1 \u2212\nen\npL \u2212 \u03b1\nen \u2212 \u221a \u03b1\n4\n2\n2\n\n(3.44)\n\nhas a commutation relation with the conformal generators:\n\n1\n1\nY\n.\n\u03b1m+n\n[Lem , e\njn , ] = mLen + \u221a ne\n2\n2\n\n(3.45)\n\nwhich is not the commutation relation of a usual spin one current which should have been\n[Lem , e\njn ] = \u2212ne\njm+n .\n\n(3.46)\n\nThis shows that even though the theory has manifest conformal affine symmetry in the compact\nlight cone gauge, in this peculiar gauge, the current is not conformal. Thus, the conformal affine\nsymmetry is not manifest and is broken by the gauge choice that mixes the compact direction\nwith an internal one.\nH\nNote that the zero mode of the current e\nj0 = d\u03c3e\nj however continues to commute with the\nHamiltonian and still remains as a manifest symmetry. If we wanted to quantize the string,\nthis is all we need, since the only physical objects are integrated worldsheet currents. We are\nhowever looking for a macroscopic extended string where the local currents on the worldsheet\nare important.\nFor the superstring, we do a similar analysis. The internal direction in this case is a little\nmore subtle and comes from within the fermionic lattice. We should then worry about how to\nconstruct the spin fields in order to get the spacetime supercharges and whether they transform\ncorrectly under the physical symmetries. We begin with the RNS fields X M , \u03c8 M , M = 0, 1..9.\nWe pick the fermions \u03c8 1,2,3 and bosonize two of them and get a system (\u03b8, \u03c8 \u03b8 ) where \u03b8 is at the\nfree fermions radius. This breaks the symmetry from Spin(10) \u2192 Spin(7) \u00d7 Spin(3).\nDefining as for the bosonic case the fields Y, Y = \u221a12 (X 9 \u00b1 \u03b8), we define the new internal\nlight-cone coordinates and fix the internal light cone gauge as in (3.35, 3.36). In addition, we\n\n\u2013 20 \u2013\n\n\falso define the fermions (\u03c8 Y , \u03c8 Y ) in an analogous manner and set\n1\n\u03c8 + = \u221a (\u03c8 0 + \u03c8 Y ) = 0.\n2\n\n(3.47)\n\nThe remaining transverse fields are {X i , (i = 1...8), Y , \u03c8 m , (m = 1, ..5), \u03c8 Y }.\nAs for the bosonic case, we can solve the theory explicitly and find that the operators\nLn \u2261 qR+ \u03b1n\u2212 obey a Virasoro algebra with cR = 12. In addition, we can also solve for \u03c8 \u2212 \u2261\n\u221a1 (\u03c8 0 \u2212 \u03c8 Y ) in terms of the other oscillators. As in the usual light cone gauge, the operators\n2\nGn \u2261 qR+ \u03c8n\u2212 combine with the operators Ln to form an N = 1 superconformal algebra.\nThe manifest symmetries that remain in this gauge are Spin(5); the Spin(3) which rotates\nthe directions (1, 2, 3) are broken by the choice of gauge.9 As for the heterotic case, the Spin(3)\ncurrent which rotates the fermions which used to be a conformal current of weight one obeys\nan equation like (3.45). The zero mode again is a manifest symmetry, and this can be added\nto the bosonic rotations to get back the Lorentz rotations.\nTo summarize, there is a global Lorentz rotation which is manifest in the internal light cone\ngauge. The local currents which rotates the chiral spinors on the worldsheet are however, not\nmanifest symmetries.\nLet us make a few comments about the Green-Schwarz spinors in this gauge. We can\nconsider the spinors which are formed by bosonizing the RNS fermions \u03c8 1,..8 and refermionizing\nthem. As in \u00a7 3.3, we can write the spinors as S a\u03b1 transforming as (2, 4) under the Spin(3) \u00d7\nij b\nSpin(5). The SU(2) above which rotated \u03c8 1,2,3 can be rewritten as S a\u03b1 \u03c3ab\nS\u03b1 . Our choice\nof gauge breaks this local symmetry on the worldsheet, but the zero mode is recovered as\ntransforming well under the Virasoro algebra.\nThe first thing to note is that these spinors are not frozen by the choice of gauge. At the\nquantum level, we have set all the oscillator modes of the operator \u2202+ ( \u221a12 X 0 + 12 X 9 + 21 \u03b8) to\nbe zero. However, the boson \u03b8 also enters the spinor lattice which is not fixed to be zero by\nthis choice of gauge. The operators in the spinor lattice should of course be written in terms\nof the correct transverse modes. The second observation is that under the Hamiltonian L0 , the\nspinor currents are not dimension one half as one may have thought since the boson \u03b8 is not a\nfree transverse oscillator. Similar comments now apply for the supercharge Qa\u03b1 \u2013 it seems to\ntransform locally under the Spin(3) \u00d7 Spin(5), but the Spin(3) local chiral rotations are not\nmanifest. Because of the way the fermion is used in the choice of the light-cone, the construction\nof supercharges is a bit subtle in this gauge and more work is needed to fully understand it.\nHowever, since it is just the familiar worldsheet theory in an unusual gauge, it is clear that such\na construction must exist.\n9\n\nThere is still a rotation of the bosons X 1,2,3 but this is not the physical angular momentum that the string\nhas in the usual light cone gauge which rotates both the bosons and fermions.\n\n\u2013 21 \u2013\n\n\f4. Holographic Dual of the Type II Superstring\nWe now consider the special case of d = 3 for type II theory compactified on IR1,1 \u00d7IR3 \u00d7T5 with\nthe worldsheet of the macroscopic string hologram extending along IR1,1 . Let us summarize the\ngroup theory associated with this compactification. The Spin(8) symmetry is broken by the\ntoroidal identifications of the bosons to Spin(3) \u00d7 Spin(5) where Spin(3) is generated by the\nangular momentum in the noncompact directions and Spin(5) acts on the tangent space of the\ntorus. The Green-Schwarz spinors transform as minimal spinors (2, 4) under this decomposition,\nSa\u03b1 , a = 1, 2, \u03b1 = 1, ..4, with a pseudo-Majorana condition so that there are eight real degrees\nof freedom. Indices are raised and lowered with the matrices \u03a9ab and C \u03b1\u03b2 , and the condition is\n(Sa\u03b1 )\u2217 = S a\u03b1 = \u03a9ba C \u03b1\u03b2 Sb\u03b2 . The details are given in Appendix B. The eight transverse bosons\nare split as X i , X m where i = 1, 2, 3 and m = 4, ..8 are vector indices under SO(3) and SO(5).\nThe eight supercurrents (Qa\u03b1 )s obey the pseudo-Majorana condition (Qa\u03b1 )\u2217 = \u2212Qa\u03b1 with the\nopposite sign compared to the spinors S a\u03b1 .\nSince the rotational symmetry is broken only by some global identifications of the bosonic\ncoordinates, the commutation relations for symmetry generators in the d = 3 case are closely\nrelated to the d = 8 case discussed in \u00a73. One needs to simply decompose the Spin(8) indices\nin terms of Spin(3) \u00d7 Spin(5) indices as above, to rewrite the commutation relations such as\n(3.25) or (3.26) appropriately for the d = 3 case.\nFrom these commutation relations of the symmetries of the hologram, we expect the near\nhorizon theory to have V irasoro \u00d7 V irasoro symmetry. The hologram also instructs us that\nthere should be a Spin(3) chiral symmetry current corresponding to the symmetry generated\nby the Knij . We further expect the symmetries of T5 10 and at least eight supersymmetries that\ncorrespond to the zero modes Qa\u03b1\n0 . We will focus on only right-movers since the discussion is\nsimilar for the left-movers.\nThe Virasoro symmetry in the boundary is most naturally realized by having an AdS3\nfactor. String theory on AdS3 is by now well understood as a WZW model based on the\nSL(2) current algebra on the worldsheet (see for example, [54, 55] and references therein). We\ntherefore start with SL(2, IR) super-affine algebra at level k which factorizes into a bosonic\nSL(2, IR) affine algebra at level kb = k + 2 and three free fermions with total central charge\nc=\n\n3kb\n3\n9 6\n+ = + .\nkb \u2212 2 2\n2 k\n\n(4.1)\n\nGiven such a super-affine SL(2, IR) algebra in the bulk, there is an elegant construction due\nto Giveon, Kutasov, and Seiberg to obtain the boundary Virasoro algebra which has central\ncharge\ncR = 6kp,\n(4.2)\n10\n\nWe use T5 to refer to a 5-torus as well its stringy symmetries depending on the context.\n\n\u2013 22 \u2013\n\n\fwhere the integer p naturally enters to be identified with the winding number. Since we want\nto identify it with the right-moving transverse superstring which has central charge 12p, we are\nforced to the choice k = 2 if we want agreement with the physical Wald entropy. The central\ncharge of the SL(2, IR) factor for k = 2 is thus 15/2 from (4.1). In addition, to account for the\nT5 factor, we must have five bosons and their NSR fermionic partners with total central charge\n15/2. Together these factors already account for all the central charge that is allowed for the\nrightmoving NSR superstring. Our bulk worldsheet thus has a target space\nSL(2, IR)k=2 \u00d7 T 5 .\n\n(4.3)\n\nThis particular Type-II model at level k = 2 has been proposed earlier in the context of small\nblack holes in [28] who arrived at it from different considerations taking a limit of magnetically\ncharged states. However, the physical interpretation that we will advance here for the type\nII theory as well as for the heterotic theory in the next section will be substantially different\nespecially with regards to the symmetries as we now summarize below.\nGiven a bulk worldsheet target space as in (4.3), we are immediately led to a puzzle if we\nwish to identify it with the near horizon theory of a small black string. Since the allowed central\ncharge of c = 15 has already been used up, there is apparently no room for anything that can\naccount for the rotational symmetries of the horizon. It was even suggested in [28] that these\nsymmetries may completely disappear in the near horizon limit.\nThe existence of symmetries of the near horizon geometry of the fundamental string has\nbeen a confusing issue to understand at the level of supergravity solutions because the answer is\nhidden at the string scale. Using the holograms as our guide proves to be very useful here. From\nthe analysis of the boundary hologram for the d = 3 case, there is no doubt about the existence\nof Spin(3) \u00d7 Spin(5) symmetry. As we have seen in \u00a72.2 , the existence of this symmetry\nis required also for understanding the R-symmetry and the entropy through its relation to\nanomalies. Therefore, if we wish to identify the bulk theory (4.3) as the holographic dual of\nthe d = 3 hologram, we must correctly exhibit the symmetries of the hologram in particular\nthe Spin(3) generated by Knij . Otherwise, we would be led to conclude that the holographic\nidentification is incorrect.\nIt turns out that the rotational symmetries can be realized in a somewhat subtle way using\nsome special properties of the k = 2 theory. For this purpose, we can view the target space\ntheory as11\nSL(2, IR)k=2\n\u00d7 U(1) \u00d7 T 5\n(4.4)\nU(1)\nThis string background can be interpreted in a few different ways. In this paper, we always\nconsider the time direction to be inside the coset, so that it is really a two dimensional black\n11\n\nThis is a schematic but fairly standard notation, the product in this equation is not a direct product, there\nare constraints which tie the U (1) to the coset.\n\n\u2013 23 \u2013\n\n\fhole [56, 57, 58]. Having said that, we note that all the calculations are done in an Euclidean\nsetting with H3+ (e.g. [59]) as standard in string theory, and one has to perform a Euclidean\ncontinuation.12 This spacetime has zero temperature, and thus admits supersymmetry.\nAlthough the irrational nature of the above conformal field theory introduces many subtleties, in many aspects, string perturbation theory can be understood as usual, in particular\na modular invariant one-loop partition function can be written down. The partition function,\nsymmetries and moduli space of precisely these theories for both the type II and heterotic cases\nwere discussed in a slightly different context13 in [61, 62].\nNow precisely when k = 2, the U(1) boson happens to be at the free fermion radius so\nthat the U(1) symmetry is enhanced. The boson can then be fermionized into two fermions\nwhich together with its fermionic partner generates the SU(2)k=2 current algebra. Using this\ncurrent algebra on the worldsheet, one can then construct the symmetry currents. We discuss\nthis construction of boundary Virasoro algebra and the boundary Spin(3) symmetry in detail\nin \u00a74.2 and \u00a74.3 using a particular (almost) free field representation.\n\nThe construction of symmetries raises a new puzzle. One finds that the commutation\nrelations of the SU(2) currents with the Virasoro generators are not what one would expect\nfrom the modes of a dimension one current. However, we find that the commutation are precisely\nas would be expected in an internal light cone gauge if the SU(2) boson was used as one of the\nlight cone direction. This commutation leads us to identify the bulk theory defined by (4.3) as\nthe holographic dual of the Type-II microscopic string hologram for T5 compactification but\nin the internal light cone gauge.\nAnother related issue that we clarify in this section is that of the construction of supersymmetries in the bulk theory. As we discussed in \u00a73.2, the boundary hologram clearly has\n(8, 8) two dimensional supersymmetry. The supercharges we will construct commute with the\nHamiltonian L0 and are interpreted as the zero modes of the (8, 8) supercurrents in the R sector\n\u2013 this implies [63] that the background is not pure global AdS3 , rather the fermions in the\nbulk can have boundary conditions corresponding to a space which is not simply connected. An\nexample of such a space is the extremal J = M = 0 BTZ black hole [64, 65] which is singular\nin general relativity. The smooth string theory we have constructed seems to capture some\naspects of the physics of this extremal black hole. It would be nice to understand the relation\nto earlier attempts to understand the entropy of this black hole using the symmetries of AdS3\n[66, 67].\n12\n\nAs was emphasized in [60], this is not such a big surprise \u2013 the convergence of the path integral demands it\njust like in string theory in ten flat dimensions.\n13\nThe above target space admits a generalization in that the U (1) factor can be made independent. This\nintroduces more moduli at a particular value of which we recover the full SL(2) structure. It also allows for a\ndifferent Euclidean continuation where the time is outside the coset.\n\n\u2013 24 \u2013\n\n\fA consistent interpretation of our theory14 is that it is the description of strings moving in\nthe background which is one of the many Ramond ground states which make up the extremal\nmassless BTZ black hole. As we shall see below, this vacuum carries maximal allowed R charge\nand can be identified with a smooth AdS3 geometry with a constant gauge connection turned\non which induces the fermions to change periodicity [68, 69, 70].\nLet us make a quick comparison to the more familiar worldsheet construction of supersymmetric AdS3 \u00d7S3 in [60]. That construction gave rise to eight supercharges from the leftmovers\n(and another eight from the rightmovers) which formed among themselves the closed subalgebra\n\u0001\ninvolving the lowest \u00b1 21 modes of the supercharges of the N = (4, 4) superalgebra in the NS\nsector. Our construction of the spacetime supercharges is explicitly different.15 We expand on\nthis later when we discuss supersymmetry.\nHaving explained the issues involved, we now present our discussion as follows. Starting\nwith Type-II strings on (4.3), we shall choose variables on the string worldsheet such that we\ncan build the symmetries of AdS3 \u00d7 T5 . In these variables, it will be clear that there are\nalso additional SU(2) \u00d7 SU(2) symmetries in the system. These symmetries are \"stringy\" and\nreplace the geometry at small scales.\n4.1 Superstrings on AdS3 \u00d7 T5\nSuperstrings on AdS3 were studied in [60] using the first order \u03b2-\u03b3 system relevant to the\nSL(2) symmetry. We instead use the fields (\u03c4, \u03b8, \u03c1) mentioned above which are better suited\nto the symmetry of our problem which near the boundary of the AdS space represent the\n16\nglobal time, angular direction and the radial\nq direction of global AdS3 . (\u03c4, \u03b8) are free fields\n\n2\nwith central charge c\u03c1 = 1 + 3Q2 . We discuss\nand \u03c1 has a linear dilaton of slope Q =\nk\na zero temperature supersymmetric AdS3 theory which is Euclidean, correspondingly the \u03c4\ndirection will be compact. The symmetry algebra that we will obtain is the SL(2) algebra\nwith a timelike direction, and its infinite extension V irasoro. The correlation functions of the\nLorentzian theory needs as usual, an analytic continuation.\nOur variables must not be thought of as being the standard AdS3 variables17 ; they are\ninstead related to it by a \"T-duality\" discovered in [73] using Buscher's rules. The geometric\naction of this duality has a fixed point and actually even changes the boundary conditions \u2013\nbut as we discuss below, demonstrating the infinite dimensional Virasoro algebra associated\n14\n\nWe thank Per Kraus for a clarifying discussion on this point.\nSuch a construction was written down in the appendix of [60] where the discussion was restricted to theories\nwhere the SU (2) currents and the SL(2) currents do not mix on the worldsheet. The result was interpreted\nas a topological theory in spacetime after imposition of an additional constraint. In our case, an additional\nconstraint is not required.\n16\nThese variables were mentioned in [60] and discussed in more detail in [71, 72].\n17\nNote that our variables actually parameterize a flat three dimensional solid cylinder in string frame.\n15\n\n\u2013 25 \u2013\n\n\fwith AdS3 elevates it to an exact stringy statement. These type of exact string backgrounds\nwere introduced in [74, 75, 76].\nIn addition, there are three fermions \u03c8\u03c4 , \u03c8\u03b8 , \u03c8\u03c1 which make the worldsheet theory N = 1\nsupersymmetric. We add the torus T5 represented by the free N = 1 system X i , \u03c7i , i = 1..5.\nAll the directions are euclidean. k is the supersymmetric level and the central charge c =\n3 + k6 + 32 + 5 \u00d7 23 . To make this a critical string theory, we need add the (b, c, \u03b2, \u03b3) ghosts with\nc = \u221215. Demanding that the total central charge vanishes fixes k = 2.\n\nIn these variables, there is a strong coupling singularity associated with the \u03c1 direction. To\nkeep string perturbation theory under control, we need to cap off this singularity. To do this,\nwe notice that the variables \u03c1, \u03c4, \u03c8\u03c1 , \u03c8\u03c4 have the central charge equal to that of the N = 2 coset\nSL(2)k=2 /U(1). This \"cigar\" coset has a geometry which smoothly caps off the strong coupling\nregion, there is a modulus associated with the value of string coupling at the tip18 which can be\nmade small so that string perturbation theory is well-defined. This is summarized in Appendix\nA.\n\nWe have essentially spelt out the decomposition of the SL(2) WZW model as SL(2)/U(1)\u00d7\nU(1) which has been used recently in many discussions of the SL(2) model e.g. to understand\nspacetime supersymmetry [77, 78], to understand the spectrum [79], the partition function [80]\nand interactions [81]. Like other related representations, this one has its advantages and drawbacks. The manifest spacetime SL(2) symmetry is lost, but we will recover explicit expressions\nasymptotically where we can use the above free field variables. In the full theory, we must use\nthe coset algebra instead. On the other hand, the symmetries related to the other fields like\n\u03b8, \u03c8\u03b8 is always manifest in our variables.\nThe symmetry algebra currents which we will write down are non-normalizable towards\nthe weak coupling end as vertex operators on the worldsheet, and therefore act on worldsheet\nconfigurations which are localized in that asymptotic region. These correspond to inserting\noperators in the boundary in the AdS/CFT correspondence [82]. As for the \u03b2-\u03b3 variables, this\nhas precise implications for e.g. the understanding of the central charge [83].\nThe angular direction of the cigar is at a specific radius which in our case is the free\nfermion radius R = 2.19 Since this direction is associated with the Euclidean time direction,\nits compactness is not directly significant to us, however the Euclidean AdS3 geometry [60]\ndictates that the angular direction \u03b8 also be at the same radius. This leads to an enhancement\nof symmetry which we discuss below. For now, this implies that the vertex operators must have\ninteger momenta in terms of this radius.\nIn the asymptotic region where the string coupling is small, the currents of the N = 1\n18\n19\n\nIn the actual AdS3 space, this modulus corresponds to the fixed value of the dilaton.\nWe keep \u03b1\u2032 = 2 throughout this section.\n\n\u2013 26 \u2013\n\n\fsuperconformal algebra are (with Q =\n\nq\n\n2\n):\nk\n\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\nT = \u2212 (\u2202\u03c1)2 \u2212 Q\u2202 2 \u03c1 \u2212 (\u2202\u03b8)2 \u2212 (\u2202\u03c4 )2 \u2212 (\u2202X i )2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n1\n1\n1\n1\n\u2212 \u03c8\u03c1 \u2202\u03c8\u03c1 \u2212 \u03c8\u03b8 \u2202\u03c8\u03b8 \u2212 \u03c8\u03c4 \u2202\u03c8\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c7i \u2202\u03c7i\n2\n2\n2\n2\n\u0001\ni\n\u03c8\u03c1 \u2202\u03c1 + Q\u2202\u03c8\u03c1 + \u03c8\u03b8 \u2202\u03b8 + \u03c8\u03c4 \u2202\u03c4 + \u03c7i \u2202X i\nG=\n2\n\n(4.5)\n\nWe choose exactly the same structure for the left movers.\n4.2 The SL(2)R symmetry from the worldsheet\n\nIf the above system indeed represents AdS3 , it should be possible to find the infinite dimensional\nSL2 symmetry algebra as operators built with these fields. Below, we construct such operators.\nAs shown in [71], this is equivalent to the construction in [60].20\nConsider the following dimension half operators on the worldsheet labeled by n \u2208 ZZ):\n1\nJn(\u22121) (z) \u2261 e2n(\u03c4 +i\u03b8) ( \u03c8\u03c4 \u2212 n\u03c8\u03c1 )(z)\n2\n\n(4.6)\n\nwhich obey the following OPE's:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n1\n1\n1\n2n(\u03c4 +i\u03b8)\n2\ne\n\u2202\u03c4 \u2212 n\u2202\u03c1 + 2n \u03c8\u03c4 \u03c8\u03c1 \u2212 i2n\u03c8\u03b8 ( \u03c8\u03c4 \u2212 n\u03c8\u03c1 ) \u2261\nJ (0)\n\u223c\nz\u2212w\n2\n2\nz\u2212w n\n1\nnm + a 2n(\u03c4 +i\u03b8)\n(0)\n(0)\ne\n(z)e2m(\u03c4 +i\u03b8) (w) +\n(n \u2212 m)Jn+m (w)\n(4.7)\nJn(0) (z)Jm\n(w) \u223c \u2212\n2\n(z \u2212 w)\nz\u2212w\nG(z)Jn(\u22121) (w)\n\nFirstly, note that the absence of higher order poles in the first OPE above involving the su(0)\npercurrent implies that all the currents e\u2212\u03c6 Jn in the (\u22121) picture (Jn in the zero picture) are\nBRST invariant on the string worldsheet and thus act on physical string states. Secondly, the\nconstant a can be changed by adding the BRST trivial operator e\u2212\u03c6 en(\u03c4 +i\u03b8) (\u03c8\u03c4 + i\u03c8\u03b8 ) mentioned above. In the zero picture this is a total derivative, and its addition can be thought of\nas shifting the vacuum energy by a constant. This is also obvious from the Virasoro algebra\nwritten below \u2013 the linear term in n in the central extension can be reabsorbed in a constant\nshift of L0 . We set this to unity as is the usual convention.\nH\n(0)\nThe charges Ln = dzJn obey the SL2 spacetime algebra\n[Lm , Ln ] = (m \u2212 n)Lm+n +\n\n20\n\nc\n(m3 \u2212 m)\u03b4m+n .\n12\n\n(4.8)\n\nOur operators in (4.6) and those in [71] differ by a BRST exact operator which in the (\u22121) picture is given\nby en(\u03c4 +i\u03b8) (\u03c8\u03c4 + i\u03c8\u03b8 ).\n\n\u2013 27 \u2013\n\n\fThe central term arises from the second order pole\nI\nI\nI\n\u0001 2m(\u03c4 +i\u03b8)\n1\n2n(\u03c4 +i\u03b8)\n2m(\u03c4 +i\u03b8)\n2n(\u03c4 +i\u03b8)\ne\n(z)e\n(w)\n=\ndw\n\u2202\ne\n(w)\ne\n(w)\ndw dz\nw\n(z \u2212 w)2\nI\n= n dw 2\u2202w (\u03c4 + i\u03b8) e2(m+n)(\u03c4 +i\u03b8) (w)\nI\n= n\u03b4m+n,0 dw 2\u2202w (\u03c4 + i\u03b8)\n\u2261 n\u03b4m+n,0 p.\n\n(4.9)\n\nWe see that c = 12p, where p is measured by the integral (4.9) and is interpreted as the number\nof fundamental strings in the system [60] . As explained in [83], this central charge computation\ndone in a single string Hilbert space is the one measured by the long strings near the boundary\nof AdS; the central charge measured by the short strings in the center of AdS arises from\ndisconnected diagrams [82].\nNote that if we want the SL(2IR) currents above to be local with respect to the Hilbert\nspace of states involving (\u03c4, \u03b8), this needs the boson \u03c4 to be compact on a circle of the same\nsize as the \u03b8 circle which we already have. The extrapolation from the semiclassical picture\nthat we did above (4.5) thus seems to be consistent with the full quantum picture. Recalling\nthat the radius of the circle is tied intrinsically to the enhancement of symmetry, we can restate\nthe above statement as the following: the consistency of the perturbative string theory with\nthe correct symmetries produces exactly the expected entropy of the system. We take this as\nstrong evidence for the existence of the hologram.\n4.3 The SU(2)R symmetry from the worldsheet\nAs mentioned earlier, we get an enhancement of symmetry since the boson \u03b8 is at the free\nfermion radius. The angular coordinate \u03b8 can be written in terms of two free fermions e\u00b1i\u03b8 \u2261\n\u221a1 (\u03c8 1 \u00b1 i\u03c8 2 ), which along with the fermion \u03c8 \u03b8 \u2261 \u03c8 3 generates a left moving SU(2)2 current\n2\nH\nalgebra with currents K i (z) and corresponding charges Ki = K i (z). This SU(2) is a physical\nsymmetry of the string theory as can be seen by the fact that its generators in the (\u22121) picture\ngiven by the dimension half currents \u03c8 i have a single pole with the worldsheet supercurrent\n(4.5).\nFrom general arguments [83], we expect that these symmetries would be extended to current\nalgebras on AdS3 giving rise to an infinite set of conserved charges, just like the global SL(2) is\nextended to the infinite dimensional Virasoro algebra [41]. However, it seems difficult to extend\nthe SU(2) global symmetry in such a manner \u2013 the technique above of using the null operator\nen(\u03c4 +i\u03b8) naively fails because the boson \u03b8 which generates the SU(2) zero modes is also involved\nin making the dimension zero operator en(\u03c4 +i\u03b8) .\n\n\u2013 28 \u2013\n\n\fOne could try to define the infinite set of operators by using the OPE between the null\noperators and the SU(2) currents above to define a normal ordering. This can be summarized in\na nice way by defining the boundary currents K i (x) as an integral over the worldsheet weighted\nby a dimension zero operator \u039b(x, z) [83]. This is a nice exercise and x gets the interpretation\nof parameterizing the worldsheet on the boundary.\nBut even if we do that, there seems to be a puzzle. One expects [83] that the worldsheet\ncurrents K i lead to corresponding currents in spacetime which are conformal currents under\nthe spacetime Virasoro, i.e. the charges Ki should be thought of as zero modes K0i of a infinite\nset of charges Kni which have the commutation relations\n[Lm , Kn ] = \u2212nKm+n .\n\n(4.10)\n\nIn particular, the zero mode should commute with all the Virasoro generators. We can check\nthat the expected commutation relation above (4.10) of a conformal current does not hold. For\nH\nexample, the commutation relations of the charges K03 = i \u2202\u03b8 with the Virasoro charges (4.6)\nis:\n[Lm , K03 ] = mLm\n\n(4.11)\n\nThis puzzle is resolved by noting that this commutation relation is precisely the one in the\ninternal light cone gauge of the boundary theory in the previous section!\nTo summarize, on the bulk string worldsheet, the V irasoro generators and the SU(2)\ngenerators mix, this makes the conformal nature of the SU(2) currents in spacetime nonmanifest. The holographic dual of this statement is that the choice of the internal light cone\ngauge on the boundary string breaks the conformal nature of the SU(2) current in the same\nway. It would be very interesting to understand if there is a different formulation of the theory\nwhere the choice of gauge is not built in, but can be added and the change of gauge is covariant.\nThe identification of the SU(2)R symmetries above also allows us to identify the spacetime\nvacuum more precisely. The integral (4.9) tells us that the spacetime vacuum carries the\nmaximal allowed U(1)R \u2282 SU(2)R charge and therefore should be interpreted as the unique\nvacuum in the Ramond sector with the corresponding value of the charge.\n4.4 The T5 symmetries from the worldsheet\nThe translation symmetries associated to the T5 at a generic point in its moduli space can be\nalso be extended into a level one U(1)5 \u00d7 U(1)5 current algebra in spacetime. The right and\nleft moving operators for these symmetries are:\nI\niR\nPn = dz e\u2212\u03c6 \u03c7i en(\u03c4 +i\u03b8) (z),\n(4.12)\nand a similar one for left movers.\n\n\u2013 29 \u2013\n\n\f4.5 The supersymmetries from the worldsheet\nNow that we have understood the bosonic symmetries fully from the worldsheet point of view,\nwe turn to the supersymmetries. The supercharges must live in representations of the bosonic\nsymmetries discussed above.\nTo get spacetime supersymmetric theories, the standard procedure in the case of compactifications to flat space is to use an N = 2 algebra on the worldsheet [84]. In the case of theories\non AdS3 , it was pointed out [60] that the algebra expected from the boundary superconformal theory is actually reproduced in the bulk using a different construction wherein one simply\nmakes spin fields out of ten free fermions and keeps those that are physical and mutually local.21\nWe actually use the standard procedure of [84] using the N = 2 worldsheet structure.22\nThis ensures that the supercharges we build are physical operators. The spacetime supercharges\nwe thus obtain are indeed not those of the NS sector of a boundary N = (4, 4) algebra, but\ninstead the supercharges of a N = (8, 8) superalgebra which have zero conformal dimension.\nThis is in accord with the discussion of the hologram in \u00a73.\nTo proceed, we spilt the worldsheet fields into two groups. The first consists of the cylinder\nformed by \u03c1, \u03b8, \u03c8 \u03c1 , \u03c8 \u03b8 . This has an N = 2 algebra (A.3) with a U(1)R symmetry JR1 \u2261 i\u2202\u03c6 =\n\u2212i\u03c8 \u03c1 \u03c8 \u03b8 + i\u2202\u03b8. This is summarized in Appendix A with X \u2261 \u03b8.23\nThe rest of the fields \u03c4, X i and their superpartners \u03c8 \u03c4 , \u03c7i (i = 1..5) are paired up to get\na complex structure and a corresponding N = 2 structure. The fermions can be bosonized\n\u2202H1 \u2261 \u03c8 \u03c4 \u03c71 , \u2202H2 \u2261 \u03c72 \u03c73 , \u2202H3 \u2261 \u03c74 \u03c75 . The U(1) R current is then expressed as a sum of the\nbilinears in these fermions JR2 \u2261 i(\u2202H1 + \u2202H2 + \u2202H3 ).\nTo perform a chiral ZZ2 projection, we can use the symmetry generated by the U(1)R\ncurrent JR1 + JR2 . In practice, the GSO projection is best implemented by introducing target\nspace supercharges and demanding locality of physical operators, as in [85]. We introduce the\n(1, 0) supercurrent operator\n\u03c6\n\n\u03c6\n\nSA (z) = e\u2212 2 \u00b1i 2 Sa (z)\n21\n\n(4.13)\n\nFor the case k = 2, there does exist a different N = 2 structure which reproduces these supercharges as we\nbriefly mention below. This is not true for generic k [80].\n22\nSuch a construction was sketched in the appendix of [60], and was interpreted (after an additional projection\nwhich threw out four of the eight supercharges) as a possible description of the R sector of the N = (4, 4) algebra\nof the D1/D5 system on T4 . As we have discussed, the bosonic as well as the super symmetries in our boundary\ntheory are explicitly different.\n23\nNote that in the above construction, since \u03c4 and \u03b8 are at the same free fermion radius, there is a different\nN = 2 supersymmetry on the worldsheet where X \u2261 \u03c4 is fermionized, and \u03c8 \u03b8 is paired with \u03c8 5 from the torus.\nUsing this structure to build the supercharges gives the standard construction of [60] for the case k = 2 wherein\nthe eight supercharges have conformal dimension \u00b1 12 and form part of a spacetime N = (4, 4) algebra. Note\nthat the two sets of eight supercharges are not local with respect to each other, so we have to choose one or the\nother.\n\n\u2013 30 \u2013\n\n\fwhere Sa is the spin field of SO(6) built out of the three pairs of free fermions and \u03c6 is the\nbosonized superghost. There are 24 = 16 such supercurrent operators, and 8 of them are\nmutually local, these are all of one chirality in the six dimensions. Of course, we would have\nobtained the same supercharges by simply making spin fields out of our ten free fermions\nand demanding consistency. For the type II theories, there is also a similar condition on the\nleftmoving side giving rise to the IIA or IIB theories.\nNow, we don't really have a SO(6) symmetry and we must arrange our supercurrents in\nthe SU(2) \u00d7 Spin(5) symmetry. From the reduction of Spin(6) \u2192 Spin(5), it is clear that the\nsupercurrents are spinors under Spin(5). One can also check that they are spinors under the\nH\nSU(2) \u2013 recall that the K 3 of the SU(2) is given by K 3 = dz \u2202\u03b8, the supercharges above\nall have a \u03b8 dependence in the exponent with a coefficient \u00b1 21 . We then have eight mutually\nlocal supercurrents which fall into the minimal spinor of this group which is a (2, 4) with a\n(pseudo)reality condition using the antisymmetric charge conjugation matrices \u03a9ab and C\u03b1\u03b2 as\ndescribed in \u00a7 3.3 and Appendix B. We accordingly call the supercurrents S a\u03b1 (z).\nNote that the supercurrents are local on the worldsheet with respect to all the vertex\noperators generating the spacetime bosonic symmetry currents described earlier, in particular\nthe spacetime Virasoro currents \u2013 again, we note the special nature of the k = 2 theory, this\ndoes not happen for generic k as was discussed in [78].\nH\nThe algebra of the supercharges Qa\u03b1 = dz Sa\u03b1 (z) can be deduced by examining the OPE\nof the currents (4.13) above. After performing the usual picture changing operation on the\nright hand side, we get:\n{Qa\u03b1 , Qb\u03b2 } = 2\u03a9ab C\u03b1\u03b2 L0 + 2\u03a9ab (C\u03b3 i )\u03b1\u03b2 Pi .\n\n(4.14)\n\nH\nwhere (i = 1..5), and L0 = \u2202\u03c4 . Since there is no \u03c4 dependence of the supercurrents (4.13),\nit is clear that all the supercharges have vanishing conformal dimension. If we restrict to the\nsubspace where P i = 0; i = 1..5, we get the supersymmetry algebra discussed earlier.\nThese supercharges are dimension zero under the spacetime Virasoro algebra (4.8), but\nthey involve the boson \u03b8, and hence suffer from the same problem as the SU(2)R symmetry \u2013\nthe supercurrents in spacetime seem not to be dimension half conformal currents. Again, this\nis what is seen in the boundary theory in the internal light cone gauge.\n\n5. Holographic Dual of the Heterotic String\nThe heterotic string shares with the type II string a chiral set of fields and physics governed\nby these fields are similar. In this section, we shall try to emphasize the novel features of the\nheterotic theory arising from the leftmovers and the process of combining the two chiralities of\nthe string fluctuations. From the leftmovers, we expect chiral symmetry currents of E8 \u00d7 E8 \u00d7\n\n\u2013 31 \u2013\n\n\fV irasoro. We then have the same bosonic fields \u03c1, \u03c4, X m ; m = 1, . . . , 5, as on the right with\nc = 10 and the gauge lattice of E8 \u00d7 E8 or SO(32) with c = 1624 . This gives us already a total\ncentral charge of 26. Counting the central charge as before, this means that the target space\nmust be of the form25\nSL(2, IR)kb =4\n\u00d7 T 5 \u00d7 E8 \u00d7 E8 ,\n(5.1)\nU(1)\nTo build a heterotic string theory, we need to combine these left movers with the rightmovers of\n(4.4) with kb = k + 2. For generic values of k, these heterotic cosets have not been studied very\nwell, but it is known that the radius of the left moving boson\nU(1) is related to\np generating the\n\u221a\nthe radius of its right moving counterpart by a factor of kb /k which is 2 in our case [28].\nIn the case of k = 2, we actually can understand this better \u2013 the modular invariance of the\npartition function dictates that the left moving boson \u03b8e generating the U(1) must be at the\n\u221a\nself dual radius (consistent with the above factor of 2) so that the symmetry is enhanced to\nSU(2)1 [62].\nIf we wish to now use a construction similar to in the previous section to construct the\nVirasoro symmetry in the boundary, we would require such a boson \u03b8\u0303 at self dual radius. Since\nwe would like the torus to have free moduli corresponding to its radii, it must actually arise\nfrom within the E8 \u00d7 E8 lattice in the same way that it arose from the SU(2)2 represented by\nthree free fermions for the supersymmetric side. This will non-trivial consequences which seem\nstrange at first sight, but as we shall see, simply corresponds to a corresponding gauge choice\nin the boundary theory as in \u00a73.3.\n5.1 The SL(2)L symmetry from the worldsheet\nIn the heterotic theory, the form of the generators on the bosonic side are different \u2013 they are\nactually much simpler since there is no constraint arising from N = 1 worldsheet supergravity.\nThe form of the SL2 currents is very similar to the supersymmetric case (4.6, 4.7), but is\ne \u03b8(0)\ne \u223c \u2212 ln z, using the techniques of\nsimpler. For a boson \u03b8e with canonical normalization \u03b8(z)\nthe previous section, it can be checked that the currents\nn\n\ne\n\nJn (z) \u2261 e a (e\u03c4 +i\u03b8) \u2202(ae\n\u03c4 \u2212 ne\n\u03c1)(z)\n\n(5.2)\n\nare physical and obey the Virasoro algebra with central charge c = 6\u03bap with \u03ba = 2a2 , p =\nH\n1\ne\n\u2202(e\n\u03c4 + i\u03b8).\na\n\u221a\nAs discussed above, the value of a = 2, i.e. all the allowed operators are of the form\ni \u221an \u03b8e\nVe 2 . This implies that for the heterotic side, \u03ba = 4 and c = 24p. The central charges are\n24\n\nFor brevity we will often refer only to E8 \u00d7 E8 but our considerations apply to both possibilities.\nThis conformal field theory looks similar to the one used in [86]. However, as we shall see below, the string\ntheory is different. In particular, the theory we consider is supersymmetric and has no background monopole\ncharge.\n25\n\n\u2013 32 \u2013\n\n\fthen simply c = 6\u03bap; with \u03ba = 2 and \u03ba = 4 for the supersymmetric and heterotic sides. As was\nnoted in [28], this is consistent with the fact that the level of the supersymmetric coset and the\nbosonic coset are k = 2 and kB = k + 2 for the two theories. The interpretation of this fact\nin [28] was in terms of a \"thermodynamic\" entropy wherein the cigar angular variable is the\nEuclidean time in a finite temperature theory. It is not very clear what such an interpretation\nmeans when the radius of the circle26 on the left and the right are not equal like in the heterotic\ncase above.\nThe microscopic computation of the entropy above follows from the central charge computation in the Virasoro algebras on the left and the right. The asymmetric nature of this circle\ndirection is completely consistent with the factorization of the theory into left and right movers.\nThe theory is at zero temperature consistent with supersymmetry; there are two non-interacting\nHamiltonians and the two corresponding central charges cL,R arise simply from counting the\nvarious vacuum configurations. It is indeed interesting that for the type II case, such a thermodynamic calculation of the entropy agrees with our microscopic one. It would be nice to\nunderstand this better.\nAs mentioned in the previous section, our interpretation of the resulting spacetime is also\ndifferent. There is a stringy Spin(3) symmetry and maximal supersymmetry as discussed in\ndetail there.\n5.2 The E8 \u00d7 E8 symmetry from the worldsheet\nThe same thing can be repeated for the gauge generators to get an E8 \u00d7 E8 (SO(32)) spacetime\ncurrent algebra\nI\nn\ne\n\u221a\n(e\n\u03c4 +i\u03b8)\nab\nJn = dz J ab (z)e 2\n(5.3)\n(z)\nwhere the J ab (z) are the dimension one gauge currents on the worldsheet.\nNote that because of the way we have 'borrowed' \u03b8\u0303 from the gauge lattice only the E8 \u00d7 E7\n(or SO(28)) part of the gauge currents are realized as conformal affine algebra. The SU(2) \u2282\nE8 \u00d7 E8 generated by the boson \u03b8e suffers from the same problem as the SU(2)R , i.e. it seem\nto be non-conformal in spacetime. This we interpret as for the SU(2)R symmetries to be\na consequence of a particular gauge that we have chosen for this construction which seems\nto correspond to an internal light cone gauge. The 'non-conformal' commutators between\nthe SU(2) currents (5.3) and Virasoro generators are then exactly what one expects in this\nparticular gauge. In fact, we could have embedded the SU(2) in the original gauge lattice in\nmany different ways which should probably be interpreted as different possible gauge choices.\nNote however that the global E8 \u00d7 E8 symmetry generated by the zero modes of the currents\n26\n\nMore precisely, the operator content of a boson at the given radius.\n\n\u2013 33 \u2013\n\n\fcommutes with the Hamiltonian and hence one can surely assert the existence of the full E8 \u00d7E8\nsymmetry.\n\n6. Conclusions and Open Problems\nWe have a proposed that a simple, free two dimensional SCFT living on a macroscopic superstring can be regarded as the hologram for the gravitational theory on AdS3 in the vicinity of\na macroscopic string. For the T5 compactification, we have written down the holographic dual\nas an exact worldsheet in the bulk. As we have seen the logic of this construction is very tight\nwhich we summarize below.\n1. To realize the full Virasoro symmetry of the boundary theory it is natural to have at least\nan SL(2, IR) WZW model. A bulk construction of a Brown-Henneaux conformal algebra\nof the AdS3 can then be given incorporating the winding number p. This Virasoro\nalgebra has the correct central charge expected from the Wald entropy only if the level\nof the WZW model is k = 2.\n2. For the heterotic string, the consistency of the perturbative string theory demands that\nthe level of the left moving WZW model be kb = k + 2 = 4, which gives the correct left\nmoving central charge.\n3. If in addition we have a T5 factor for the superstring and an additional level one E8 \u00d7 E8\nfactor for the left-movers of the heterotic string, then one finds that the maximally allowed\nworldsheet central charge of 15 for the superstring and 26 for the bosonic string are already\nsaturated. The target space therefore must be of the form (4.4) for the superstring and\n(5.1) for the left-moving heterotic string.\n4. The form of the target space in (4.4) however raises an important puzzle about the symmetries. If this is to be identified with a small black string in a IR3 \u00d7 T 5 compactification\nthen its global symmetries must contain a Spin(3) factor corresponding to IR3 rotations.\nFortunately, precisely for k = 2, the U(1) boson in (4.4) is at the free fermion radius and\nit is then possible to construct the Spin(3) currents using this fact. All global symmetries\nexpected for the horizon of a black hole and independently from the boundary hologram\ncan be constructed from the bulk theory. Similarly, for the heterotic string, the boson is\nat the self dual radius which makes it possible to recover all the symmetries.\n5. One also expects Spin(3) affine currents from the bulk corresponding to Knij in the hologram. The symmetry currents can be constructed from the bulk but one finds that the\ncommutation relations with the Virasoro generators are unusual and are not what one\nmight expect for the modes of a conformal dimension one current. We note however that\n\n\u2013 34 \u2013\n\n\fthe commutations are exactly what one might expect from the boundary hologram (3.45)\nif it was gauge fixed using an unusual internal light cone gauge discussed in \u00a73. This\nsuggests that one should identify the symmetry algebra constructed from the bulk constructed using these particular variables with the corresponding algebra in the hologram\nin a particular internal light cone gauge.\n6. One can construct in the bulk eight chiral supersymmetries corresponding to the zero\nmodes Qa\u03b1\n0 expected from the boundary in the Ramond sector.\n7. To obtain a small black hole from a small black string, we should identify along the length\nof the string to obtain a compact circle. The generator of such a translation is L0 \u2212 L\u03030 .\nNote that both L0 and L\u03030 commute with the Spin(3) and E8 \u00d7 E8 currents and hence\nsuch an identification would commute with the symmetries.\nIt is nontrivial that a such a consistent worldsheet theory exists. The bulk worldsheet construction is very tightly constrained. The requirements of the maximal allowed central charge of the\nbulk worldsheet and the physical requirements following from symmetries and Wald entropy\nlead almost uniquely to the theory that we have used. Using this theory we are then able to\ngive a detailed construction of all boundary symmetries in a particular free field realization\nwhich seems to correspond to a particular choice of internal gauge in the boundary theory.\nThe most unsatisfactory part of our construction is the necessity to choose this particular\nunusual gauge. If the basic identification of the target space (4.4) and (5.1) is correct, then\nit should be possible to construct the symmetries in a way that corresponds to the usual\n(compact) light cone gauge where they are manifest. This suggests that it may be possible\nto generalize the GKS construction [60] to construct the boundary Virasoro algebra abstractly\nonly from the SL(2, IR)/U(1) factor that does not require us to borrow a U(1) factor. The\ncoset theory does not admit SL(2, IR) symmetries. However, what we are really after are is a\nVirasoro symmetry in the boundary. The coset theory is expected to have an extended chiral\nalgebra. For example, in the compact analog, SU(2)k /U(1) is just the parafermion theory\nthat does not have SU(2) symmetry but admits a conserved spin-3 currents that generates the\nW3 algebra which is nonlinear. Perhaps one can obtain realization of the boundary Virasoro\nalgebra utilizing these additional (nonlinear) symmetries in the bulk. This is a very interesting\nopen problem and could be related to large extended algebras as suggested in [29] (see [32] for\na recent discussion).\nThe existence of a worldsheet construction resolves many of the puzzles relating to small\nblack holes and in particular gives a construction of the near horizon geometry of both heterotic\nand Type-II small black holes in four dimensions. The identification of the macroscopic string\nworldsheet theory as a boundary hologram is very useful in understanding the physics. In particular, the issues about global and local symmetries and the applicability of the Kraus-Larsen\n\n\u2013 35 \u2013\n\n\fargument in this context becomes transparent. There are chiral stringy currents generated by\nK ij , a linear combination of some of which can be identified with an R-current. These do not\ncorrespond to the nonchiral gauge symmetries generated by J ij that are visible in supergravity\nfor which the bulk Chern-Simons terms vanishes.\nThere are a number of possible generalizations and open questions.\n1. The holograms make it clear that there is nothing special about d = 3. This is consistent\nwith what one might expect from scaling analysis in supergravity. So if a holographic\ndual exists for d = 3, it is expected to exist for all values. It seems likely that the other\nhigher dimensional theories can be obtained simply by decompactifying the T5 . This is\nwhat is required in the boundary hologram and it should be true also in the bulk. For\nexample, when T5 is replaced by a noncompact IR5 , one can add to the angular momentum\nJ mn an orbital angular momentum term involving Lmn . The full Spin(8) symmetry is\nnot manifest but it is because of the choice of the gauge that breaks it to Spin(8) to\nSpin(3) \u00d7 Spin(3). Getting the off-diagonal currents J mi should also be possible but\nrequires more work.\n2. One can also contemplate holograms in more general compactifications. This gives a rich\nclass of examples of this kind of 'string-string holography' where the hologram and the\ndual both have a worldsheet description. For example, T5 could be replaced by K3 \u00d7 S1 .\nThe analysis of the hologram can be repeated simply by replacing T4 by K3 in the\ntransverse CFT of the macroscopic superstring. The holographic dual is obtained by a\nsimilar replacement in (4.4) so that the target space is now\nSL(2, IR)k=2\n\u00d7 U(1) \u00d7 S 1 \u00d7 K3.\nU(1)\n\n(6.1)\n\nSince both the bulk and the boundary are given by tractable worldsheet conformal field\ntheories, it ought to be possible to test this holography in greater detail than has been\npossible in other contexts. For example, a comparison of correlation functions might be\npossible as was done for the related F1-NS5 system [87, 88].\n3. One thing to keep in mind is that the boundary theory is expected to correspond to a\nstring field theory of the bulk theory that includes the multi-string states as well. It\nwould be interesting to see if it is possible to construct the string field theory of the bulk\nusing conventional methods of string field theory and to compare it with the boundary\nhologram. In another related direction, it would be interesting to try to understand the\nknown non-perturbative objects like D-branes in the bulk AdS3 from the perspective of\nthe boundary theory.\n\n\u2013 36 \u2013\n\n\f4. In the bulk, the AdS3 structure in the bulk is an important part of the symmetry algebra,\nwhich manifests itself in the associated Brown-Henneaux stress tensor. In the boundary,\nthis translates to closed algebras which contain the Virasoro generators. As we have\nseen, with a few additional assumptions, like that of linear realization and no higher\nspin currents constrains these algebras very tightly. It would be interesting to look for\nnon-linear generalizations which involve higher spin operators.\n5. There is also the related issue of single string v/s multi string Hilbert spaces. The boundary theory has a large extended chiral algebra which involves all the chiral operators on\nthe string, these are not expected to be realized in the bulk single string Hilbert space.\nThe symmetries of the single-string Hilbert space in the bulk form a closed subalgebra. So\nit seems reasonable to expect that only a maximal closed algebra that includes Virasoro\nwill be realized in the single-string Hilbert space and not all extended algebras.\n6. The orbital angular momentum generators Lij which rotate only the bosons on the boundary appears to be absent in the bulk. On the boundary, for the heterotic case, there are\ntwo symmetries generated by J ij and S ij but in the bulk we have only one. More work is\nneeded to fully understand the details of this correspondence.\n7. A singly macroscopic string with p windings along a single circle is marginally unstable\nunder decay into p strings with unit winding. One then has to take into account the multistring branch analogous the Coulomb branch in the D1-D5 system [89]. In the context of\nF1-NS5 systems this necessitates turning on Fayet-Illiapoulos terms in the gauge theory\nthat correspond to RR fluxes in the bulk. For fundamental strings, the multi-string branch\ncan be prevented by the simple device of adding momentum or winding along in internal,\nbut not both, along an internal circle. This makes the configuration stable under marginal\ndecay without changing the entropy as explained in \u00a72.2. For such configurations, an\ninternal light-cone gauge would be more natural.\n8. The way we measured entropy is by using a long fundamental string probe in AdS3 .\nThis involved a definition (although natural) of the \"number\" of F-strings p which in the\ncontext of SL(2, IR) current algebra is related to the spectrally flowed sectors.\n9. The hologram that we have discussed can also be related to the usual gauge-gravity duality\n[90, 91, 92] by S-duality. If we consider N D1-branes in this context [93], then the dilaton\nbecomes strong near the core. So one must perform an S-duality trasnformation to go to\nthe weak coupling F-string description to see the horizon that we have discussed. We are\ntaking a deep infrared limit of the D1-brane worldvolume theory. In this limit the 1 + 1\ntheory is simply the symmetric product (IR8 )N /SN where SN is the symmetric group of\nN objects [94]. There are many twisted sectors of this orbifold classified by the conjugacy\n\n\u2013 37 \u2013\n\n\fclasses of the symmetric group which are given by collections of cycles of various lengths\n(see [71, 95, 96] for a discussion in a similar context). Here we have discussed the sector\nin the orbifold with cycle length p.\nAcknowledgements\nIt is a pleasure to thank Edi Gava, Gaston Giribet, Per Kraus, Finn Larsen, Samir Mathur,\nShiraz Minwalla, Kumar S.

A short summary of the N = 2 SL(2)/U (1) coset\nThe semiclassical geometry of the cigar in the string frame is:\nQ\u03c1\n4\u03c0\n)dX 2 ,\nX \u223cX+\n;\n2\nQ\nQ\u03c1\n\u03a6 = \u03a60 \u2212 log cosh( ),\nBab = 0.\n2\n\nds2 = d\u03c12 + tanh2 (\n\n(A.1)\n(A.2)\n\nwith the string coupling gs = e\u03a6 . Semiclassically, this metric is a good one for string propagation\nbecause the dilaton obeys the equation 2Da Db \u03a6 + Rab = 0, where Da is the spacetime covariant\nderivative, and Rab is the spacetime curvature. After adding two fermions, the theory can be\nmade N = 2 supersymmetric. The exact description is given by the supersymmetric coset\nSL(2)k /U(1) with Q2 = 2/k. The string coupling at the tip gs = e\u03a60 is the one modulus of this\ntheory. To get the two dimensional Lorentzian black hole, we need to Wick rotate the angular\ndirection X = iT .\nIn the asymptotic region \u03c1 \u2192 \u221e, the geometry reduces to a flat cylinder of radius R = Q2\nwith the dilaton varying linearly along its length.

In five Euclidean dimensions, one can pick the charge\n\u22121\n\u22121\nt\nconjugation matrix C to be \u03c31 \u2297 \u03c32 which obeys\u0012C t = \u0013\n\u2212C, C \u2020 =\n\u0012 C =\u0013C, C\u0393C\u0012 = +\u0393\u0013.\n1 0\n0 \u2212i\n0 1\n,\n, \u03c33 =\n, \u03c32 =\nThe sigma matrices are the standard ones: \u03c31 =\n0 \u22121\n1 0\u0012\n\u0013 i 0\n0 \u03c32\nand the convention for direct product is such that C =\n.\n\u03c32 0\nThe matrix B = C t is used to impose a Majorana type condition. In this case, we have\na pseudo-Majorana condition using the matrices B\u03b1\u03b2 and \u03a9ab = i\u03c32 . The pseudo-Majorana\ncondition is \u03bb\u2217 = B\u03a9\u03bb, such that (B \u2217 )\u2217 = B Another way to write this is to define the\nMajorana conjugate as \u03bb = \u03bbt \u03a9t C and then define \u03bb = \u03bb\u2020 .\nSpinors have a lower index \u03bb\u03b1 and their Majorana conjugates have an upper index \u03bb\u03b1 .\nIndices are raised and lowered with C and \u03a9:\n\u03bba\u03b1 = \u03bba\u03b2 C \u03b2\u03b1 ;\n\n\u03bba\u03b1 = C\u03b2\u03b1 \u03bba\u03b2\n\n(B.1)\n\n\u03bba\u03b1 = \u03bb\u03b1b \u03a9ab ;\n\n\u03bb\u03b1a = \u03a9ab \u03bb\u03b1b\n\n(B.2)\n\nIn terms of the indices, the pseudo-reality condition is (\u03bba\u03b1 )\u2217 = \u03bba\u03b1 .\n\nReferences\n[1] A.
