Introduction\nIn the type of statistical models considered here, a fixed underlying graph carries\na random realization of a structure, consisting of values (boolean, in a finite\nalphabet or scalar) carried by bonds (edges) or sites (vertices), and usually\ninteracting via local rules. We will focus on the Ising and Potts models (and\nmore generally cyclic and abelian spin models), where each site carries a random\n\"spin\"; the discrete Gaussian free field, where a scalar height function is defined\non sites; the random cluster model, where realizations are random subgraphs;\nand the six-vertex model, where each edge has a random orientation.\nThe key question is to understand the large scale random structures generated\nby these local interactions. For instance, one may study the correlations between\nlocal configurations observed at large distance on the underlying graph. We will\ngenerically refer to (functions of) these local inputs as order variables.\nHistorically, a fundamental tool, introduced by Kramers and Wannier in\nthe context of the Ising model, is duality, which maps the model defined on\na (weighted) graph to the same model on another (weighted) graph. Of particular interest are the \"fixed points\" of these duality transformations; they often\ncoincide with a critical point of the model, at which one can observe large scale\nrandom structures. This type of duality is observed in a variety of models, and\nfor abelian models can be phrased in terms of the Fourier-Pontryagin transform\nand the Poisson summation formula.\nAgain in the context of the Ising model, Kadanoff and Ceva showed that under\nduality, order variables are mapped to \"disorder\" variables, which represent a\nmodification of the state space by the introduction of local \"defects\"; moreover,\nthe field-theoretic concept of fermion finds a combinatorial incarnation as the\n\u2217 Partially\n\nsupported by NSF grant DMS-1005749 and the Alfred P.

Such\ncombinations are referred to as parafermionic or spinor variables.\nIn these notes, we will describe duality, order, disorder, and spinor variables\nfor abelian spin models and the discrete free field. We then discuss combinatorial\nmappings between the Potts model, the random cluster model, the six-vertex\nmodel, and the dimer model.\nFor focus and (relative) self-containedness, we do not discuss here a number\nof major contiguous subjects. These include: phase transition, transfer matrices and Bethe ansatz ([2, 38]), Yang-Baxter solvability ([2]), infinite volume\nmeasures ([15, 18]) and limit shapes ([3, 27, 38]), scaling limits and SchrammLoewner Evolution ([47, 43]).\n2. Spin models\n2.1. Ising model\nDefinition\nIn the Ising model ([32, 36, 19]) , a configuration on an underlying finite\ngraph \u0393 = (V, E) consists of an assignment of a spin value \u03c3(v) \u2208 {1, \u22121} to\neach vertex v \u2208 V . The weight of a configuration is:\nY\nexp (\u03b2Je \u03c3(v)\u03c3(v \u2032 ))\nw(\u03c3) =\ne=(vv \u2032 )\u2208E\n\nwhere Je 6= 0 is a coupling constant attached to the edge e \u2208 E and \u03b2 > 0 is\nthe inverse temperature. Plainly the model (up to normalization) depends only\non the edge weights:\nw(e) = exp(\u22122\u03b2Je )\nIt is occasionally convenient to allow w(e) = 0, i.e. Je = +\u221e. Note that these\nweights are invariant under spin flip: w(\u2212\u03c3) = w(\u03c3). One may also consider\n\u00b1 boundary conditions, that is, fixing the values of spins to \u00b11 on some prescribed subsets V \u00b1 of V (the configuration space then consists of spin collections\n(\u03c3(v))v\u2208V s.t. \u03c3(v) = \u00b11 for v \u2208 V \u00b1 ). One may also consider some segments\non the boundary to be wired, viz. connected by edges with zero weight, so that\nthe only contributing configurations are constant on these segments (a wired\narc may be equivalently represented as an extended vertex).\nThe partition function is\nX\nw(\u03c3)\nZ = Z(\u0393, (Je )e\u2208E ) =\n\u03c3:V \u2192{\u00b11}\n\nWe denote the expectation under the probability measure given by P(\u03c3 = \u03c30 ) =\nw(\u03c30 )/Z by h*i.\nA classical object of interest is the spin correlation\nh\u03c3(v1 ) * * * \u03c3(vn )i\nimsart-ps ver. 2011/11/15 file: cornell.tex date: October 31, 2018\n\n\fJ. Dub\u00e9dat/Topics on abelian spin models and related problems\n\n2\n\nfor v1 , . . . , vn graph vertices (in particular when they are at large distance) and\nthe spin variables \u03c3(v)'s are fundamental examples of order variables.\nThe spin correlations depend on the boundary conditions. A wired arc may\nbe seen as a boundary arc along which couplings are infinite (vanishing edge\nweights); in turn, \u00b1 boundary arcs may be represented in terms of wired arcs\nand spin variables. For example, if \u03b3 + , \u03b3 \u2212 are two disjoint boundary arcs, we\nhave\nD\nE\nX * 1+\u03c3(x)\n* 1\u2212\u03c3(y)\n2\n2\nE w,w\nhXi+,\u2212 = D\n1+\u03c3(x) 1\u2212\u03c3(y)\n* 2\n2\nw,w\n\nwhere X is a generic random variable, the expectation on the LHS is for \u00b1\nboundary conditions on \u03b3 \u00b1 , and the expectations on the RHS are for \u03b3 + , \u03b3 \u2212\n(separately) wired arcs. This shows that, allowing for general couplings, it is\nenough to treat free boundary conditions.\nFrom now on we will consider the planar case; \u0393\u2020 = (V \u2020 , E \u2020 ) denotes the\nplanar dual of \u0393, so that faces of \u0393 correspond to vertices of \u0393\u2020 , and vice-versa\n(Figure 1).\n\nFig 1. Left: a portion of a planar graph \u0393. Right: its dual \u0393\u2020\n\nMore precisely, it is rather convenient to think of vertices on a wired arc\nof the boundary as a single extended vertex; and to connect vertices on a free\nboundary or extended vertices to a vertex at infinity by edges with weight 1\n(i.e. with no interaction). If e \u2208 E, we denote e\u2020 the corresponding edge of \u0393\u2020 ;\nfor oriented edges, e\u2020 crosses e from right to left.\nGraphical expansions\nIn the low-temperature regime (\u03b2 \u226b 1), disagreements between neighboring\nspins are severely penalized. The low temperature expansion of the Ising model\nconsists in mapping a spin configuration (\u03c3v )v\u2208V to a subgraph P = (V \u2020 , EP )\nof \u0393\u2020 , where EP = {e = (vv \u2032 )\u2020 \u2208 E \u2020 : \u03c3(v)\u03c3(v \u2032 ) = \u22121}. At low temperature\nthis graph is typically sparse. The spins (\u03c3v ) may be recovered from P up to\n\nimsart-ps ver. 2011/11/15 file: cornell.tex date: October 31, 2018\n\n\fJ.

It is easily checked\nthat P is an even degree subgraph of P ; such subgraphs are called polygons.\nThe (unnormalized) Ising measure on spins (\u03c3v ) projects to a measure on\npolygons:\nY\nw(P ) = 1{P admissible}\nw(e\u2020 )\ne\u2208EP\n\nomitting a multiplicative factor 2 (for overall spin flip).\nLet us turn to the high temperature expansion. Since \u03c3(v)\u03c3(v \u2032 ) = \u00b11, we may\nwrite\nexp(\u03b2Je \u03c3(v)\u03c3(v \u2032 )) = cosh(\u03b2Je ) (1 + tanh(\u03b2Je )\u03c3(v)\u03c3(v \u2032 ))\nLet us define a dual edge weight:\nw\u2032 (e) = tanh(\u03b2Je )\nIn the high temperature regime (\u03b2 \u226a 1), these dual edge weights are close to 1.\nStarting from the partition function, we obtain\nX\nY\nexp(\u22122\u03b2Je 1{\u03c3(v)\u03c3(v\u2032 )=\u22121} )\nZ(\u0393, (Je )e ) =\n\u03c3:V \u2192{\u00b11} e=(vv \u2032 )\u2208E\n\n=\n\nY\n\n=\n\ne\u2208E\n\nY\n\n(1 + w\u2032 (e)\u03c3(v)\u03c3(v \u2032 ))\n\n\u03c3:V \u2192{\u00b11} e=(vv \u2032 )\u2208E\n\ne\u2208E\n\nY\n\nX\n\ncosh(\u03b2Je )\n\nX\n\ncosh(\u03b2Je )\n\nX Y\n\nw\u2032 (e)\u03c3(v)\u03c3(v \u2032 )\n\n\u03c3:V \u2192{\u00b11} E0 \u2282E e\u2208E0\n\nby fulling expanding the product. Then exchanging summations leads to\nY\nX\nY\nZ(\u0393, (we )e ) = 2|V |\ncosh(\u03b2Je )\nw\u2032 (e)\ne\u2208E\n\nP polygon e\u2208EP\n\nThen comparing high and low temperature expansions, we have the KramersWannier duality ([29, 30]) for partition functions:\n!\nY\ncosh(\u03b2Je ) Z(\u0393\u2020 , (Je\u2020 ))\nZ(\u0393, (Je )e ) = 2|V |\ne\u2208E\n\nwhere\n\n\u2020\n\ne\u22122\u03b2Je = tanh(\u03b2Je )\n1\u2212w(e)\n1\u2212w\n. Note that w 7\u2192 1+w\nis involutive. It exchanges 0 and 1,\nor w\u2032 (e) = 1+w(e)\nso that wired boundary components are exchanged with free boundary components. To retain positive weights after the duality transformation, we need to\nstart from ferromagnetic couplings, i.e. Je \u2265 0.\nIf \u0393 is (a portion of) the square lattice, \u0393\u2020 is identical to \u0393, up to boundary\nmodifications. For instance, one can consider \u0393 to be a rectangle with half-wired\nand half-free boundary conditions, in which case \u0393\u2020 is exactly isomorphic (as a\n\nimsart-ps ver. 2011/11/15 file: cornell.tex date: October 31, 2018\n\n\fJ.

Thus for the square lattice the fixed point wsd = 2 \u2212 1\nof the duality mapping w 7\u2192 1\u2212w\n1+w is self-dual, in the sense that it is fixed for\nKramers-Wannier duality (at least \"in the bulk\").

For periodic boundary conditions\n(i.e. when \u0393 is embedded on a torus), one requires additionally that any noncontractible (with respect to the torus) path on \u0393\u2020 crosses an even number of\nedges of P .\nSuch a polygon with defects at {v1 , . . . , vn } does not correspond to a spin\nconfiguration on \u0393\u2020 . Following Kadanoff and Ceva ([23]), this motivates the\nintroduction of disorder variables, which encode a modification of the state\nspace.\nThe data of (\u03c3v )v\u2208V is equivalent, up to global spin flip, to the data (d\u03c3(e))e\u2208E ,\nwhere d\u03c3(vv \u2032 ) = \u03c3(v \u2032 )\u03c3(v)\u22121 .

Discrete Gaussian Free Field\nWe have considered abelian spin models with values in a finite abelian group.\nMore generally one may consider a locally compact abelian group (the natural\nset-up for Fourier-Pontryagin duality). Let us consider scalar fields, i.e. fields\ntaking values in R.\nAs before, we consider a finite connected planar graph \u0393 = (V, E). It is\nsomewhat convenient to designate a non-empty subset \u2202 of V as the boundary.\nWe consider discrete scalar fields, i.e. functions \u03c6 : V \u2192 R. The values of \u03c6 on \u2202\nare fixed to some prescribed \u03c6|\u03b4 . This defines an affine state space. Let us also\nfix positive conductances (ce )e\u2208E .\nThe Discrete Gaussian Free Field (DGFF) on (\u0393, (ce )) with Dirichlet boundary condition \u03c6|\u03b4 on \u2202 is the Gaussian variable with measure proportional to\nY\n\ne=(vv \u2032 )\u2208E\n\nexp(\u2212\n\nY d\u03c6(v)\nce\n\u221a\n(\u03c6(v \u2032 ) \u2212 \u03c6(v))2 )\n2\n2\u03c0\nv\u2208V \\\u2202\n\nFor f : V \u2192 R, its Dirichlet energy can be written:\n\n1X\n1 X\nce (f (v \u2032 ) \u2212 f (v))2 =\nf (v)(\u2206\u0393 f )(v)\n2\n2\n\u2032\nv\u2208V\n\ne=(vv )\n\nby a discrete Green's formula argument, where \u2206\u0393 is the weighted graph (positive) Laplacian:\nX\n(\u2206\u0393 f )(v) =\nc(vv\u2032 ) (f (v) \u2212 f (v \u2032 ))\nv \u2032 \u223cv\n\nUnder our assumptions,\n\n\u2206\u0393 : {f : V \u2192 R, f|\u2202 = 0} \u2192 {f : V \u2192 R, f|\u2202 = 0}\nis indeed invertible and the Dirichlet energy is a positive definite form on {f \u2208\nRV , f|\u2202 = 0}. Consequently the above Gaussian measure is finite. The mean field\n\u03c60 is the one minimizing the Dirichlet energy in the affine space {f \u2208 RV , f|\u2202 =\n\u03c6\u2202 }, i.e. the solution of the Dirichlet problem: (\u2206\u0393 f )V \\\u2202 = 0, f|\u2202 = \u03c6\u2202 .\nThe covariance kernel C(v, v \u2032 ) = Cov(\u03c6(v)\u03c6(v \u2032 )) is the Green kernel G for\n\u2206\u0393 , viz. is characterized by \u2206\u0393 G(., v \u2032 ) = \u03b4v\u2032 in V \\ \u2202, G(v, v \u2032 ) = 0 for v \u2208 \u2202.

The Gaussian variable J induced on this affine space by\nthe Dirichlet energy can be written J = Jh + J0 where Jh , the mean, is the\ncurrent of minimal energy with given magnetic charge distribution and J0 is a\ncentered field with covariance kernel:\nCov(J(v1 v2 ), J(v3 v4 )) = G(v2 , v4 ) + G(v1 , v3 ) \u2212 G(v2 , v3 ) \u2212 G(v1 , v4 )\n(In the absence of a boundary, G(., v) is well defined only modulo an additive\nconstant, which is enough to define the RHS).\nIf J = d\u03c6 is an exact 1-form, we have\nX\nX\nX\nc e Je \u03c9 e =\n\u03c6(v)\ncvv\u2032 \u03c9(vv \u2032 )\ne\u2208E\n\nv\u2208V\n\nv \u2032 \u223cv\n\nP\nwhich shows that the orthorgonal inPL2 (E, ce \u03b4e ) of exact 1-form are harmonic 1-forms, i.e. those satisfying v\u2032 \u223cv cvv\u2032 \u03c9(vv \u2032 ) = 0 for all v. It is convenient to define a discrete Hodge star operator \u2217 : \u03a91 (\u0393) \u2192 \u03a91 (\u0393\u2020 ) defined\nby (\u2217\u03c9)((vv \u2032 )\u2020 ) = cvv\u2032 \u03c9(vv \u2032 ) ([33]).

Clearly, \u2217 maps harmonic\nforms on \u0393 to closed forms on \u0393\u2020 , and vice-versa. Thus J \u2208 \u03a91 (E) can be de1\ncomposed uniquely as J = d\u03c6 + \u2217d\u03c8 where d\u03c6 \u2208 \u03a9P\n(\u0393) and d\u03c8 \u2208 \u03a91 (\u0393\u2020 ) closed;\n2\nthis Hodge decomposition is orthogonal Rin L (E, ce \u03b4e ). By analogy with the\ncontinuous case, we write hJ, J \u2032 iL2 (E) = J \u2227\u2217J \u2032 (see [33]). Moreover, \u2206\u0393 = d\u2217d\n(as usual identifying vertices of \u0393 with faces of \u0393\u2020 ). Consequently, the form Jh\nwith minimal Dirichlet energy among those such that dJ = m is:\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nX\nJm = \u2217d \uf8ed\nmf G\u2020 (., mf )\uf8f8\nf \u2208V \u2020\n\nwhere G\u2020 is the Green kernel on \u0393\u2020 .\nDuality.\n\nLet us consider abelian duality for the centered DGFF. At this point we\ncould write mixed electric-magnetic correlators in terms of G, G\u2020 and see duality\nappear in these explicit formulae. For ease of comparison with the finite case,\nwe phrase duality in terms of Fourier transform.\nIn general one can fix an electric charge\nP (\u03b1v )v\u2208V and a magnetic\nP distribution\ncharge distribution (mf )f \u2208F , such that v \u03b1v = 0, f mf = 0.

If v\u00b1 circles counterclockwise around f+ , the correlator picks\nup a factor exp(\u00b1i\u03b1m); assuming \u03b1m \u2208 2\u03c0Z removes multivaluedness issues.

Given \u03b1, \u03b2, there\nisR a unique\nR closed, harmonic form d\u03c9\u03b1,\u03b2 (d\u03c9\u03b1\u03b2 = 0, d \u2217 \u03c9\u03b1,\u03b2 = 0) such that\n( A \u03c9\u03b1,\u03b2 , B \u03c9\u03b1,\u03b2 ) = (\u03b1, \u03b2). The space of 1-forms decomposes as an orthogonal\nsum of exact, coexact, and closed and harmonic forms: this is (a discrete version\nof) the Hodge decomposition. Thus an instance of a free field current J can be\ndecomposed as J = d\u03c6 + \u03c9, where \u03c6 is a scalar field (on V , defined modulo\nadditive constant) and \u03c9, the instanton component, is a closed harmonic form;\nthese two summands are independent.\nIt is classical R([14, 4])\nR to consider a compactified version of the field, in which\nin the periods ( A J, B J) are constrained to take values in a prescribed lattice 2\u03c0rZ (r is the compactification radius).

These loops separate clusters in \u03930 from\nclusters in \u0393\u20200 , and it is easily seen that the number of loops is C(E0\u2032 ) = C(E0 ) +\nC(E0\u2020 )\u22121.

Plainly, the\nonly contributing RC configurations are those in which v1 , v2 are connected by a\ncluster and f1 , f2 are connected by a dual cluster. Equivalently, in the loop representation, there is a loop L passing through (v1 f1 ) and (v2 f2 ). Configurations\ncontaining L will be counted with a phase depending of the isotopy type of L in\nC \\ {v1 , f1 , v2 , f2 }. We now explain how to compute this phase. For definiteness,\nlet us fix a defect line \u03b3 from f1 to f2 .\nConsider the half-loop L+ (resp. L\u2212 ) of L starting from (v1 f1 ) and ending\nat (v2 f2 ) with v1 , v2 on its LHS (resp. RHS). Let us orient both half-loops from\n(v1 f1 ) to (v2 f2 ). One may also orient all other loops arbitrarily. If all loops have\nan orientation, one may define a height function h : V\u2666 \u2192 \u03c02 Z as follows: if\nv, f are adjacent vertices in V\u2666 , h(f ) \u2212 h(v) = \u00b1 \u03c02 according to whether the\n\u2212\n\u2192\nloop crossing vf crosses it from left to right or right to left; then the loops may\nbe seen as level sets of h. In the present case, the definition is ambiguous due\nto the conflicting orientations of L+ , L\u2212 . Then h may be seen as an additively\nmultivalued function, picking a constant \u00b1\u03c0 when circling around (v1 f1 ), (v2 f2 );\nthis is closely analogous to the notion of magnetic charge we discussed for the\nDGFF.\nTake a path from v1 to v2 on the cluster that contains them. It crosses \u03b3\nn times (algebraically: crossing \u03b3 from left to right counts +1, from right to\nleft counts -1); and \u03c3(v2 )\u03c3(v1 )\u22121 = exp( 2i\u03c0kn\nq ). Specifically, we can look at the\nleftmost (resp. rightmost) such path, that tracks L+ (resp. L\u2212 ) on its RHS\n\u00b1\n(resp. LHS).

A configuration consists in an assignment of orientation\n(\"arrow\") to each edge, in such a way that every\u0001 vertex is the origin and the\nendpoint of two oriented edges. Thus there are 42 = 6 possible local configurations around a given vertex (Figure 2). Graphs with higher (even) valencies may\nbe considered: for a 6-regular graph (eg the triangular lattice), one may consider\nan orientation such that each vertex has 3 ingoing and 3 outgoing\n\u0001 edges. This\ndefines the (configuration space of) the 20-vertex model (as 63 = 20). Note\nthat reverting all orientations preserves the 6V condition.\n\nFig 2. 6V configurations\n\nIn the 6V model, one associates a Gibbs weight to each configuration, which is\na product of local factors, read from the local configuration around each vertex.\nIn the planar case (or oriented case), one may order edges cyclically around a\nvertex; then there are four (in-in-out-out) configurations (up to rotation: types\n1-4) and two (in-out-in-out) configurations (types 5-6). Types are also numbered\nso that 1-2,3-4,5-6 are exchanged by reversal of all orientations.\nLet us denote w1 (v), . . . , w6 (v) the local Gibbs weights around the vertex v\nand Iv = Iv (\u03c9) \u2208 {1, 6} the type at v of the configuration \u03c9; then the Gibbs\nweight of \u03c9 is:\nY\nw(\u03c9) =\nwIv (\u03c9) (v)\nv\u2208V\n\nLet us denote \u03c9\u0304 the configuration obtained by reversing all arrows in \u03c9.

On the square lattice, the rotationally invariant weights\n(w1 = * * * = w4 , w5 = w6 ) give the F -model.\nRemark that replacing the weights (wi (v)) with (\u03bbvQ\nwi (v)) has the effect of\nmultiplying weights of all configurations by a constant v\u2208V \u03bbv , a trivial modification.

First we have the current variables J(e\u2020 ) \u2208 \u00b1 \u03c02\n(which are sometimes thought of as \u00b11 spin variables). Then one can define\nnatural electric correlators of type:\nhexp(i\u03b1(h(f \u2032 ) \u2212 h(f )))i\n(for definiteness, one needs to fix a path from f to f \u2032 ), with \u00b1\u03b1 electric charge\nat f, f \u2032 .\nA convenient way to introduce disorder (magnetic) operators is to introduce\nedge defects. An edge e split into two half-edges with outward orientation represents a magnetic charge 12 (i.e. the height field picks up 21 (2\u03c0) when cycling\ncounterclockwise around this charge); symmetrically, an edge e split into two\nhalf-edges with inward orientation represents a magnetic charge \u2212 21 .\nLet us now restrict to the standard case of the square lattice with periodic\nconditions ( n1 Z2 /L, where L is a sublattice, L \u223c Z + \u03c4 Z where n \u226b 1 is a scale\nparameter and \u03c4 \u2208 H = {z : I(z) > 0} fixed), and isotropic weights, so that we\n2\nmay set a = b = 1, and \u2206 = 1 \u2212 c2 .

This is expected to hold in the \"regime\nIII\" phase, i.e. when \u22121 < \u2206 < 1 or 0 < c < 2.\nRelation with FK percolation.\nFor clarity we stick to the square lattice with periodic boundary conditions\n(and even periods). There is a close relation between FK percolation and the\nsix-vertex model, which is best expressed in terms of the Baxter measure, which\nwe now describe.\nStarting from \u0393 modelled on the square lattice, we consider its dual graph\n\u0393\u2020 and the diamond graph \u2666, which is itself locally a (scaled, rotated) square\nlattice. Associated to an FK configuration on \u0393 and its dual configuration, we\nhave constructed a dense O(n) configuration (loop gas) on D\u2666. It is convenient\nto represent its segments as quarter circles: in each face of \u2666, two nonintersecting\nquarter circles connect the four edge midpoints. Starting from the self-dual FK\nweights, the weight of the O(n) is simply (up to normalization) nl where l is\n\u221a\nthe number of loops and n = q. See Figure 3.\n\nFig 3.

In the\nthermodynamic limit, one expects the number of these non-contractible loops\n(or, for that matter, the cardinality of any class of macroscopic loops) to stay\n\u221a\ntight. If 0 < q < 4, one chooses s so that 2 cos(2\u03c0s) = q; then the image of\nthe Baxter measure projected on dense O(n) loop configurations has a density\n\u221a\nproportional to q \u2212|{non\u2212contractible loops}| wrt the random-cluster measure (in\nits loop representation).\nOn the other hand, if one retains orientations (at each edge midpoint of \u2666)\nand forget loops, one obtains a six-vertex configuration on \u2666\u2020 (see Figure 4),\nwith weights:\n\u03c91 = * * * = \u03c94 = 1, \u03c95 = \u03c96 = ei\u03c0s + e\u2212i\u03c0s\n\u221a\nso that a = b = 1, c2 = 2 + q.\n\nFig 4. 6V configurations and corresponding plaquette configurations for oriented loops (on\neach column)\n\nIt is worth pointing out that in this mapping, the parafermionic FK observables are mapped to magnetic-electric six-vertex observables.

Let us discuss topological observables ([5, 37, 1]).\nFix \u03c9 = \u03b1dx + \u03b2dy (thinking of the graph \u0393 as having small mesh \u03b4 and\nbeing embedded on a macroscopic torus \u03a3 = C/(Z + \u03c4 Z), \u03b1, \u03b2 fixed, and \u03c4 \u2208\ni(0, \u221e) for simplicity; A, B are the standard cycles on \u03a3). Let us modify the\nlocal Baxter weights\nas follows: the weight of an oriented quarter circle QT is\nR\nexp(is \u03c02 ) exp(i QT \u03c9). The weight of an oriented loop is now exp(\u00b12i\u03c0s) for a\nR\ncontractible loop and exp(i L \u03c9) for a non-contractible loop. The possibilities\nfor non-contractible loops are: no such loops (in which case either a cluster or\na dual cluster contains paths homotopic to A and B); 2k loops homotopic to\nmA + nB, gcd(m, n) = 1 (in which case there are k clusters homotopic to a\nsimple path representing mA + nB separated by k dual clusters). Let us denote\npk,m,n the probability of this event under the random cluster measure. In this\ncase, summing over orientations yields a relative weight (2 cos(m\u03b1 + n\u03b2))2k .\nOn the six-vertex side, each north (resp. west, south, east) pointing edge gets\na relative weight ei\u03b2\u03b4 (resp. e\u2212i\u03b1\u03b4 , e\u2212i\u03b2\u03b4 , ei\u03b1\u03b4 ). Collecting the weights\nR of edges\nalong an horizontal (resp. vertical) path on \u0393\u2020 yields exp(\u2212i 2\u03b2\u03b4\nJ) (resp.\n\u03c0\nA\nR\nexp(i 2\u03b1\u03b4\nJ)).\n\u03c0\nB\nSummarizing, setting\nX\n1X\npk,m,n (2 cos(m\u03b1 + n\u03b2)q \u22121/2 )2k\nf (\u03b1, \u03b2) = p0 +\n2\nk\u22651 gcd(m,n)=1\n\nwe have the exact identity:\nf (\u03b1, \u03b2)\n= E6V\nf (0, 0)\n\n\u0012\n\u0012\nZ\nZ \u0013\u0013\n\u03b1\n\u03b2I\u03c4\nexp 2i\nJ \u2212 2i\nJ\n\u03c0 B\n\u03c0\nA\n\nAdmitting that the 6V height function converges to a compactified free field\nexpresses the RHS as a theta function.\nThe free fermion point.\nFor c2 = a2 + b2 , the (square) six-vertex model may be mapped exactly on\na (weighted) dimer model on its medial graph. Fan and Wu ([10]) first showed\nthe existence of a such a dimer representation in the more general context of\nthe eight-vertex model. The mapping presented here is in particular apparent\nin the study of the six-vertex model with \"domain wall boundary conditions\"\n([22]) and its relation with alternating sign matrices and the \"aztec diamond\"\nproblem for dimers ([8, 9, 12]). The correspondence between dimer and 6V\nconfigurations is represented in Figure 5. Specifically, we start from \u0393 which\nis modelled on the square lattice and carries a 6V configuration. Its (planar)\nderived graph D\u0393 is also modelled on the square lattice; it has a 2-coloring,\nwith black vertices corresponding to horizontal edges of \u0393 and white vertices\ncorresponding to vertical edges of \u0393. A dimer configuration (or perfect matching)\non D\u0393 is a subset m of edges of D\u0393 such that each vertex of D\u0393 is an endpoint\nof exactly one edge in m.\nimsart-ps ver. 2011/11/15 file: cornell.tex date: October 31, 2018\n\n\fJ. Dub\u00e9dat/Topics on abelian spin models and related problems\n\n25\n\nFig 5. 6V configurations and corresponding local dimer configuration (bold edge: dimer)\n\nIn the 6V\u2194 dimer correspondence, if (bw) \u2208 m, with b (resp. w) the midpoint\n\u2212\n\u2192\nof an horizontal (resp. vertical) edge of \u0393, then: bw points in the direction of the\n\u2212\n\u2192\nedge through b (with its 6V orientation) \u00b1 \u03c04 ; wb points in the opposite direction\nof the edge through w (with its 6V orientation) \u00b1 \u03c04 . It is easy to see that this\nprescription maps dimer tilings to 6V configuration, and that the tiling may be\nreconstructed from the 6V configuration up to local ambiguities (see type 5 in\nFigure 5). One may also introduce defects: for instance, inserting edge defects at\nb, w (with respective magnetic charges \u2212 21 , 21 ) corresponds exactly to considering\ndimer configurations with monomer defects at b, w ([13]).\nIn the dimer model ([27]), each dimer configuration receives a weight\nY\nw(m) =\nwe\ne\u2208m\n\nwhere the we 's are fixed edge weights. Here, set we = cos(\u03b8) for SW \u2212 N E\nedges and we = sin(\u03b8) for SE \u2212 N W edges. Plainly, the corresponding 6V\nconfiguration has vertex weights:\n(a : b : c) = (cos(\u03b8) : sin(\u03b8) : 1)\ni.e. we recover the free fermion point of the six-vertex model: a2 + b2 = c2 or\n\u2206 = 0.\nIn this case, we see that, up to normalization, the dimer height function (as\ndefined in [45, 27] for the dimer model on a bipartite planar graph, taken here on\nevery other face) is the height function of the corresponding 6V configurations.\nIn this case, building on Kasteleyn's determinantal solution of the dimer model\n([24]), one can verify that the thermodynamic limit is described in some details by a (compactified) free field with coupling constant g = 2. In particular,\none can handle infinite volume Gibbs measures ([3, 28]); current correlations\nand scalar field limit ([26]; for current correlations, it is convenient to consider\nheight variations on the even sublattice of \u0393\u2020 ); compactified free field limit (for\nan underlying periodic graph, [6]); magnetic and electric correlators ([6]).\n\nimsart-ps ver. 2011/11/15 file: cornell.tex date: October 31, 2018\n\n\fJ.
