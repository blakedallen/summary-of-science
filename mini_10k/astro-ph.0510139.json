Introduction\nClassical Cepheids play a central role in establishing cosmological distance scale. An accurate calibration of their P \u2212 L relation is,\ntherefore, crucial. While the slope of this relation is well determined by Cepheids of the\nLarge Magellanic Cloud, its zero point still remains uncertain. The long-baseline optical interferometry offers a novel way of Cepheid distance determination, by using purely geometrical version of the Baade-Wesselink method\n(e.g. Kervella et al. 2004). So far, the technique was successfully applied only to a handful of Cepheids, but with increased resolution\nof next generation instruments (CHARA and\nAMBER) more stars will become accessible.\nThe goal of this work is to identify\nCepheids, which are most promising targets\nfor observations with existing and future interferometers. For that purpose, we calculated\nexpected mean angular diameters and anguSend offprint requests to: P.

The resulting catalog can serve as a planning tool for\nfuture interferometric observations. Full version of the catalog can be found in Moskalik\n& Gorynya (2005; hereafter MG05).\n\n2. Method\nFirst, Cepheid absolute magnitudes were estimated with the period\u2013luminosity relation of\nFouqu\u00e9 et al. (2003). The observed periods of\nfirst overtone Cepheids were fundamentalized\nwith the empirical formula of Alcock et al.\n(1995). Comparison of derived absolute magnitudes and dereddened observed magnitudes\nyielded Cepheid distances.\nThe mean Cepheid radii were estimated\nwith the period\u2013radius relation of Gieren et al.\n(1998). Variations of Cepheid radii during pulsation cycle were calculated by integrating\nthe observed radial velocity curves. For all\nCepheids we used the same constant projection factor of p = 1.36.

Results\nResults of our calculations are summarized in\nTable 1. In Fig. 1, we display h\u03b8i and \u2206\u03b8 vs. pulsation period for all Cepheids of our sample.\nAt the level of technology demonstrated already by VINCI/VLTI and PTI instruments,\nthe achievable accuracy of h\u03b8i determination is\nabout 0.01 mas. This implies a lower limit of\nh\u03b8i = 1.0 mas, if measurement with 1% accuracy is required. Angular diameters of 13\nCepheids are above this limit, four of which\nhave not been yet observed (SV Vul, U Car,\nRS Pup and overtone pulsator FF Aql).\nMost interesting for interferometric observations are Cepheids, whose angular diameter\nvariations can be detected. This has been possible for stars with \u2206\u03b8 > 0.15 mas. 13 Cepheids\nare above this limit. These objects cover uniformly the period range of log P = 0.73 \u2212 1.65\nand are well suited for calibration of Cepheid\nP\u2212L and P\u2212R relations. Until now, angular diameter variations have been measured only for\nsix of them.

We encourage observers to concentrate their efforts\non these objects.\nWith shorter wavelength (H-band instead of K-band) and longer baselines, the\nnew CHARA and AMBER interferometers will offer substantial increase of resolution. Consequently, the list of Cepheids\nwith measurable amplitude diameter variations\nwill grow to \u223c 30 objects, creating excellent prospect for very accurate calibration of\nCepheid P \u2212 L and P \u2212 R relations.\n\nReferences\nAlcock, C. et al. 1995, AJ, 109, 1652\nFouqu\u00e9, P., Storm, J. & Gieren, W. 2003,\nin Stellar Candles for Extragalactic Distance\nScale, ed.
