L. Chudnovskiy\u2217\n\narXiv:cond-mat/0502282v2 [cond-mat.mes-hall] 17 Mar 2005\n\n1. Institut f\u00fcr Theoretische Physik, Universit\u00e4t Hamburg, Jungiusstr. 9, 20355 Hamburg, Germany\n(Dated: July 9, 2018)\nWe consider the spin and orbital Kondo effect in a parallel arrangement of two strongly electrostatically coupled quantum dots. Increasing the exchange of electrons between the dots through the\nattached leads induces a transition between the SU (4) spin- and orbital Kondo effect and SU (2)\nspin Kondo effect. Being the same for the SU (4) and SU (2) symmetry points, the Kondo temperature drops slightly in the intermediate regime. Experimentally, two kinds of Kondo effects can\nbe discriminated by the sensitivity to the suppression of the spin Kondo effect by Zeeman field.\nThe dependence of the Kondo temperature on Zeeman field and the strength of electronic exchange\nmediated by the leads is analyzed in detail.\n\nKondo effect in quantum dot devices remains a subject of active theoretical and experimental investigations\nsince its first observation [1]. The observation of the\nKondo effect with orbitally degenerate levels provided\nthe first demonstration of the strong influence of the\norbital structure of the states in the dot and attached\nleads on the Kondo effect [2]. Further exploration of\nthe interplay between spin and orbital degrees of freedom in the Kondo effect became possible in experiments\nwith double dot systems. If the two dots are strongly\nelectrostatically coupled [3, 4], then there are regions in\nthe charging diagram of the double dot device, where\nthere is no energy cost to transfer an electron between\nthe two dots. In that regions, the two ground states\nof the double dot system with occupations of the two\ndots (N1 \u2212 1, N2 + 1) and (N1 , N2 ) are degenerate. The\ntwo ground states build a two-dimensional Hilbert space\nwhich spans the representation of the SU (2) group, hence\na spin-like degree of freedom called pseudospin can be assigned to those two states. Quite analogously to and to a\nlarge extent independently of the well-known spin Kondo\neffect, the orbital fluctuations in transport through the\ndouble dot result in the development of the orbital, or\npseudospin Kondo effect. Furthermore, at special values of Kondo couplings, the combined spin and pseudospin Kondo Hamiltonian possesses a SU (4) symmetry\nwith respect to rotations in the spin-pseudospin space.\nIn that regime, the SU (4) Kondo effect with greatly enhanced Kondo temperature has been predicted theoretically [5, 6].\nThe existence of the pseudospin Kondo effect crucially\nrelies on the coupling of each quantum dot to its own\nelectronic reservoir formed by the electron states in the\nattached leads. The separation of the reservoirs allows to\ndefine a pseudospin for the electrons in the leads in a natural way. For two sequentially coupled quantum dots [6]\nsuch a separation is given by geometry. In contrast, the\nrealistic experimental geometry for two dots coupled in\nparallel to the leads does not introduce a separate reservoir for each dot a priori [3].\nIn this letter, we investigate the possibility and properties of spin and pseudospin Kondo effect in a double dot\n\nembedded in a parallel circuit with the attached leads if\nthere is no separate electron reservoirs for each quantum\ndot. The separation between the two electronic reservoirs is characterized by the asymmetry of amplitudes of\neach electronic mode to tunnel from the reservoir into\none or into the other dot. We introduce a measure of\nmixing between the two reservoirs that reflects the structure of tunnel matrix elements. The mixing between the\nreservoirs can be varied either by changing the potential barrier that separates them or by applying the perpendicular magnetic field [7]. Without the perpendicular magnetic field, in the limit of completely symmetric\ntunneling from each mode to both quantum dots, the\nKondo effect in the orbital sector is suppressed. At the\nsame time, all modes of both reservoirs couple to a single electron state given by a symmetric combination of\nthe states localized in each dot. This results in the doubling of the density of states in the reservoir for the spin\nKondo effect. At the end, the Kondo temperatures for\nthe two symmetry points, the SU (4) one and the SU (2)\none, are equal [5, 10]. We find however that the Kondo\ntemperature gets slightly suppressed in the intermediate\nregime between the two symmetry points (see inset in\nFig. 2) independently of the method used to change the\nmixing between the two reservoirs (potential barrier or\nperpendicular magnetic field). This result should be contrasted with the analysis given in Ref. [7]. The change\nin symmetry of the Kondo effect can be detected experimentally by applying an external Zeeman magnetic field\nin the plane of the double dot device. An external Zeeman field suppresses the Kondo effect in the spin sector. Therefore, whereas the SU (2) Kondo effect is completely suppressed by the Zeemann field, the combined\nspin-pseudospin SU (4) Kondo effect is only reduced to\nthe SU (2) Kondo effect in the pseudospin sector. In what\nfollows we derive an expression for the Kondo temperature as a function of mixing between the reservoirs and\nof a Zeeman magnetic field in the whole range between\nthe SU (4) and SU (2) regimes.\nWe consider a device consisting of two single-level\nquantum dots coupled in parallel to external Fermi liquid\nleads. The Hamiltonian represents a sum of the follow-\n\n\f2\ning terms: the Hamiltonian of isolated dots including\nthe interdot interaction, the Hamiltonian of Fermi liquid\nreservoirs, and the tunneling between the quantum dots\nand the source (\"s\") and drain (\"d\") leads\nH = HQD +\n\nX\n\nHrres + H t .\n\n(1)\n\nr=s,d\n\nThe Hamiltonian of isolated quantum dots reads\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\nX X\n\uf8f0\nEi n\u0302i\u03c3 + U n\u0302i\u2191 n\u0302i\u2193 \uf8fb + U12 n\u03021 n\u03022 ,\nHQD =\ni=1,2\n\nHt =\n\nX \u0012 |T s |\nk\n\nk\n\nwhere Tk =\n\nTk\n\n\u03a8\u0302\u2020sk +\n\n\u0013\n|Tkd | \u2020\n\u03a8\u0302dk \u03a6\u0302 + h.c.,\nTk\n\n(2)\n\nwhere the following notations are introduced: n\u0302i\u03c3 =\n\u0109\u2020i\u03c3 \u0109i\u03c3 \u2013 the number of electrons in the dot i with zprojection of spin \u03c3 (\u03c3 =\u2191 or \u2193), \u0109i\u03c3 is an annihilation\noperator of an electron in dot i with spin projection \u03c3.\nWe focus on the SU (4) Kondo regime that is achieved at\nE1 = E2 = E, U12 = U . The low energy sector of the\nmodel consists of states with a total of one electron in\nthe double dot. Their energy in the isolated dots equals\nE(< 0). The corresponding ket-vectors are denoted as\n|\u03c3, 0i and |0, \u03c3i, where 0 denotes the unoccupied dot.\nSingle particle tunneling transforms the low energy states\ninto the empty state |0, 0i (energy 0) or into states with\na total of two electrons (energy E + U (> 0)), which are\n| \u2191\u2193, 0i, |0, \u2191\u2193i, |\u03c31 , \u03c32 i. The excited states with a total of\nmore than two electrons in a single dot do not couple to\nthe low-energy sector in second order in tunneling. They\nare omitted from consideration.\nThe tunneling Hamiltonian is given by\nX X X\nr \u2020\nHt =\nTik\n\u00e2rk\u03c3 \u0109i\u03c3 + h.c.\n(3)\ni=1,2 r=s,d k\u03c3\n\nIn the presence of perpendicular magnetic field, the tunnel matrix elements are complex. We choose a symmets\ns\ns\ns\nd\nric gauge: T1k\n= ei\u03c6/4 |T1k\n|, T2k\n= e\u2212i\u03c6/4 |T2k\n|, T1k\n=\n\u2212i\u03c6/4\nd\nd\ni\u03c6/4\nd\ne\n|T1k |, T2k = e\n|T2k |, where \u03c6 is the AharonovBohm phase in presence of perpendicular magnetic field.\nTo elucidate the appearance of the pseudospin in a general case, when each electronic mode has nonvanishing\ntunneling amplitudes to both quantum dots, let us define the tunneling angle \u03b7kr for each mode in the given\n|T r |\nreservoir by the following relations: cos (\u03b7kr ) = T1kr ,\nk\nq\nr\n|T2k\n|\n2\n2\nr\nr\nr\nr\nsin (\u03b7k ) = T r , where Tk = |T1k | + |T2k | .

One can see from (6) that\n|T s |\n\n\u03c3=\u2191\u2193\n\n\u03a6\u0302 = (\u01091\u2191 , \u01091\u2193 , \u01092\u2191 , \u01092\u2193 )T .\n\nwe rewrite the tunneling Hamiltonian in the form\n\n|T d |\n\nfor each k it is only the mode \u03a8k = Tkk \u03a8\u0302sk + Tkk \u03a8\u0302dk\n[8]. Performing the Schriefer-Wolff transformation for\nHamiltonian (1), we derive the effective Kondo Hamiltonian describing the dynamics of the low-energy sector of\nthe model that can be written as\nHK =\n\n3\nX\nX\n\n\u2032\n\nkk\nJ\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03a6\u0302\u2020 (\u03c4\u0302 \u03bc \u2297 \u03c4\u0302 \u03bd ) \u03a6\u0302\u03a8\u0302\u2020k (\u03c3\u0302 \u03bc \u2297 \u03c3\u0302 \u03bd ) \u03a8\u0302k\u2032 +Hres .\n\n\u03bc,\u03bd=0 k,k\u2032\n\n(7)\nHere \u03a6\u0302\u2020 (\u03c4\u0302 \u03bc \u2297 \u03c3\u0302 \u03bd ) \u03a6\u0302 and \u03a8\u0302\u2020k (\u03c4\u0302 \u03bc \u2297 \u03c3\u0302 \u03bd ) \u03a8\u0302k represent the\n\"hyperspins\" in the pseudospin-spin SU (4) space for\nthe double dot and fermionic reservoir respectively, \u03c4\u0302 \u03bc\nand \u03c3\u0302 \u03bc denote the corresponding Pauli matrices. For\nthe SU (4) symmetry\npoint,\n\u0011 the Kondo couplings equal\n\u0010\n1\n1\nkk\u2032\nJ\u03bc\u03bd = Tk Tk\u2032 E+U \u2212 E for all \u03bc, \u03bd \u2208 {0, ..., 3} except\n\n\u03bc = \u03bd = 0. In what follows we assume the |Tkr | to be\nindependent of k, hence we omit the indeces k, k \u2032 at J\u03bc\u03bd .\nNote the principal difference between the hyperspins in\nthe quantum dot and in the reservoir. Whereas operator \u03a6\u0302 incorporates four dynamical degrees of freedom,\nthe operator \u03a8\u0302k does only two, \u00e2rk\u2191 and \u00e2rk\u2193 . The angle \u03b7kr is not dynamical. Yet this angle can fluctuate\nwith wave vector k. The magnitude of those fluctuations\ndetermines whether the pseudospin in reservoirs is promoted to a dynamical degree of freedom. For example,\nif the reservoirs for two quantum dots are strictly separated for both source and drain leads, then the angle \u03b7kr\nassumes two possible values 0 and \u03c0/2, which results in\nstrong fluctuations of \u03b7kr with k, and eventually leads to\nthe pseudospin Kondo effect. In contrast, if each lead,\nthe source and the drain, contains only a single common\nreservoir for both dots, then, without the perpendicular\nmagnetic field (\u03c6 = 0) the tunneling amplitudes to both\nr\nr\ndots are equal T1k\n= T2k\n\u2200k. In that case, the angle \u03b7kr is\nfrozen at the value \u03c0/4 for any k and r, and the orbital\nKondo effect is suppressed.\nIn what follows we present results of the renormalization group (or poor man scaling) analysis of the Hamiltonian (7). We consider the case of equal coupling strengths\ns\nd\nto the source and drain, that is |Tik\n| = Tik\n|, hence\ns\nd\n\u03b7k = \u03b7k . The one loop renormalization of the Kondo\ncouplings J\u03bc\u03bd is given by the diagram in Fig. 1 and\nthe diagrams obtained by change of direction of arrows\nfor solid or dashed lines. The propagators of the field\nin the double dot D\u0302(i\u03c9n ) and in the electronic reservoir\n\u011c(i\u03c9n , k) are given by\n\u0001\nD\u0302(i\u03c9n ) = 1/ (i\u03c9n ) 1\u03022 \u2297 1\u03022 ,\n(8)\n\n\f3\n\u0014\n\nFIG. 1: One loop renormalization of Kondo coupling.

The new interactions\n\u0001\nhave the structure J\u03bc\u03bb\u03bd \u03a6\u0304 (\u03c4 \u03bc \u2297 \u03c4 \u03bd ) \u03a6 * \u03a8\u0304 \u03c3 \u03bb \u2297 \u03c3 \u03bd \u03a8,\nwhere all the indices \u03bc, \u03bb and \u03bd change independently.\nWe consider the case where the tunnel couplings to\nthe two dots are symmetric, that is b3 = 0. The mixing between the two reservoirs is now determined by\nthe value of the parameter b1 . b1 = 0 corresponds to\nthe case of two strictly separated reservoirs, where the\nSU (4) Kondo effect is expected, whereas the maximal\nvalue b1 = b0 = 1/2 corresponds to a single common\nreservoir for both quantum dots. In the latter case only\nthe spin SU (2) Kondo effect is possible. The chosen form\nof the operator P\u0302 with b1 6= 0 distinguishes the coupling\nconstants with \u03bc, \u03bb = 0, 1. It turns out that the only\ncoupling constants with \u03bc 6= \u03bb that are generated by\nthe RG-transformation are J10\u03bd and J01\u03bd . The constants\nwith \u03bc = \u03bb = 2, 3 have the same RG-flow, we further\ndenote them as J\u22a5\u03bd . Without loss of generality we take\nthe direction of the Zeeman magnetic field along the zaxes. We use the approximation that the Zeeman field\nfreezes out the spin fluctuations as soon as the running\nvalue of the field equals the high energy cutoff \u039b. The\ncondition for the running Zeeman field h(lh ) = h0 elh = \u039b\n\n\u2297 1\u0302(9)\n2,\n\nwhere \u03b7ks = \u03b7kd = \u03b7k . One can see that in comparison\nto the pure SU (2) \u2297 SU (2) Kondo effect as predicted\nfor sequentially coupled dots, the presence of mixing between the reservoirs results in a nontrivial structure of\nthe fermion propagator \u011c(i\u03c9n , k) in orbital space.

Numerical solution of the RGequations (14)\u2013(17) allows to determine approximately\nthe Kondo temperature as a function of b1 . The solution is shown in the inset in Fig. 2. One can see that\nwithout the external Zeeman field, or for Zeeman enSU(4)\nergy less than the Kondo temperature TK\n, the Kondo\ntemperature diminishes only slightly between the SU(4)symmetric point b1 = 0 and the SU(2) symmetric point\nb1 = 0.5. Therefore, the transition between the SU (4)\nand SU (2) Kondo effect can hardly be seen in the change\nof the Kondo temperature without the external Zeeman\nfield [10].\n\n\fSU(4)\n\nK\n\n1,0\n\nK\n\nK\n\nKondo temperature T /T\n\nK\n\n1,00\n\nKondo temperature T /T\n\nSU(4)\n\n4\n\n0,95\n1,000\n\n0,996\n\n0,90\n\n0,992\n\n0,0\n\n0,0\n\n0,1\n\n0,2\n\n0,1\n\n0,3\n\n0,4\n\n0,2\n\n0,5\n\n0,3\n\n0,4\n\n0,8\n0,7\n0,6\n0,5\n0,4\n0,3\n0,2\n0,1\n\n1,0\n\n0,5\n\n1,1\n\n1,2\n\n1,3\n\n1,4\n\n1,5\n\nZeeman field h/T\n\nMixing parameter b\n\n1,6\n\nSU(4)\n\nK\n\n1\n\nFIG. 2: Kondo temperature as a function of mixing b1 for\ndifferent Zeeman fields h.

The\nsuppression of the Kondo temperature with Zeeman field\nand with the mixing b1 illustrates our findings (20).\nIn conclusion, we considered the transition between the\nSU(4) and SU(2) Kondo effects in a double dot system\nembedded in a parallel circuit with attached leads. The\ntransition is induced by the transfer of electrons between\nthat dots through the leads, which violates the conservation of the pseudospin. Despite having the same Kondo\ntemperature, the SU(4) and spin SU(2) Kondo effects\ncan be distinguished by the sensitivity to the in plane\nZeeman magnetic field. We derived the dependence of\n\nFIG. 3: Kondo temperature versus Zeeman magnetic field at\ndifferent values of mixing b1 .

Being the basic energy scale, the Kondo temperature determines all\nother experimentally observable properties related to the\nKondo effect. Therefore, the calculated dependence of\nthe Kondo temperature of Zeeman magnetic field and\nthe mixing parameter can be seen in the measurements\nof the conductance through the double dot device. The\nobtained results can also be relevant to the experiments\non Kondo effect in carbon nanotubes [10].\nThe author thanks D. Pfannkuche, M. Trushin and\nF. Hellmuth for valuable comments.
