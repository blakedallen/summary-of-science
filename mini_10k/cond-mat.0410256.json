Verkin Institute for Low Temperature Physics & Engineering,\nUkrainian Academy of Sciences, Kharkov 61103, Ukraine\n(Dated: October 17, 2018)\nWe explain the experimental data on the magnetization of LaRhIn5 recently published by R. G.\nGoodrich et al. in Phys. Rev. Lett. 89, 026401 (2002). We show that the magnetization of a small\nelectron group associated with a band-contact line was detected in that paper. These data provide\nthe first observation of the Berry phase of electrons in metals via the de Haas - van Alphen effect.\nPACS numbers: 71.18.+y, 03.65.Vf\n\nIn recent years the concept of the so-called Berry phase\n[1] has attracted considerable attention thanks to its fundamental origin, see, e.g., Refs. 2, 3 and citation therein.\nAccording to Berry, if a Hamiltonian of a quantum system depends on parameters, and if the parameters undergo adiabatic changes so that they eventually return\nto their original values, the wave function of the system\ncan acquire the so-called geometrical phase in addition to\nthe familiar dynamical one. This additional phase (the\nBerry phase) differs from zero when the trajectory \u0393 of\nthe system in the parameter space is located near a point\nat which the states of the system are degenerate [1]. In\nanalyzing this situation, Berry assumed that the Hamiltonian of the system is a Hermitian matrix which is linear\nin deviations of the parameters from the point, and he\npresented his final result in the pictorial form. He found\nthat such the point can be considered as a \"monopole\" in\nthe parameter space when the geometrical phase is calculated. In other words, the point \"generates\" a field which\ncoincides in the form with that of the monopole, and the\nflux of this Berry field through the contour \u0393 gives the\ngeometrical phase of the system. Evidence for this phase\nwas obtained in experiments with various physical systems [2, 3]. However, an experimental observation of\nthe Berry phase for electrons in crystals has proved a\nchallenging problem (some progress in this direction was\nachieved only recently [4, 5, 6]).\nIt is well known (see, e.g., Ref. 7 ) that the semiclassical motion of an electron in a crystal in the magnetic field\nH can be represented as the motion of the wave vector k\nin an orbit in the Brillouin zone. This orbit is the intersection of the constant-energy surface, \u03b5(k) =const, with\nthe plane, kz =const, where z is the direction of the magnetic field H and \u03b5(k) is electron dispersion relation in the\ncrystal. Berry's result is applicable to such the electron,\nwith the Brillouin zone playing the role of the parameter space [8]. However, in crystals with the inversion\nsymmetry and a weak spin-orbit interaction, the Berry\nphase of the electrons has the specific features [9] which\nare due to the fact that the electron states are invariant\nunder the simultaneous inversion of time and spatial coordinates. This invariance permits one to transform the\nHermitian Hamiltonian of the electron into the real form\n\nfor any point of the Brillouin zone. As a consequence,\nthe character of the energy-band degeneracy differs from\nthat considered by Berry. Now the electron energy bands\n\u03b5l (k) contact along lines in the Brillouin zone, and the\nlines need not be symmetry axes [10]. In other words,\nthe degeneracy is not lifted along these lines, and the\nmonopole in the k space disappears. As it was shown\nin our paper [9], in such the situation the band-contact\nlines play the role of infinitely thin \"solenoids\" which\ngenerate the Berry field with the flux \u00b1\u03c0. Although this\nfield is zero outside the solenoids, but if the electron orbit surrounds the line, the flux threads the orbit, and\nthe electron acquires the Berry phase \u03c6B = \u00b1\u03c0 when it\nmoves around this line. It is clear that in this case the\nBerry phase does not depend on the shape and the size of\nthe electron orbit but is specified only by its topological\ncharacteristics (there is either a linking of the orbit with\nthe band-contact line or there is not).\nThe Berry phase of the electron modifies [9] the wellknown semiclassical quantization rule [11] for the electron\nenergy in the magnetic field, \u03b5,\nS(\u03b5, kz ) =\n\n2\u03c0eH\n(n + \u03b3),\nh\u0304c\n\n(1)\n\nwhere S is the cross-sectional area of the closed electron\norbit in the k space; n is a large integer (n > 0); e is the\nabsolute value of the electron charge, and the constant \u03b3\nis given by\n\u03b3=\n\n1 \u03c6B\n\u2212\n.\n2\n2\u03c0\n\n(2)\n\nThe meaning of formula (2) is the following: When\nthe electron makes a complete circuit in its orbit, the\nchange of the phase of its wave function consists of the\nusual semiclassical part h\u0304cS/eH, the shift \u2212\u03c0 associated\nwith the so-called turning points of the orbit where the\nsemiclassical approximation fails, and the Berry phase.\nEquating this change to 2\u03c0n, one arrives at Eqs. (1), (2).\nThus, when the electron orbit links to the band-contact\nline, one obtains \u03b3 = 0 (the values \u03b3 = 0 and \u03b3 = 1 are\nequivalent) instead of the usual value [11] \u03b3 = 1/2. This\nchange of \u03b3 has to manifest itself in de Haas - van Alphen\neffect [9].\n\n\f2\n\n\u03b5\u00b1 (k) = \u03b50+\n\nh\u03042 k32\n+h\u0304(v\u22a5*k)\u00b1\n2m3\n\nq\n2\n2\n(h\u0304V1 k1 ) +(h\u0304V2 k2 ) , (3)\n\nwhere the wave vector k is measured from the k0 ; the\nconstants m3 , V1 , V2 , and v\u22a5 = (v1 , v2 , 0) are some parameters of the spectrum; the k3 axis coincides with the\ntangent to the band-contact line at the point k0 , and the\nk0 is defined by the condition that the band energies in\nthe line [ \u03b5+ (k) = \u03b5\u2212 (k) there ] reach the extremal value\n\u03b50 at this point. A small extremal cross section can exist\nonly under the condition, a2\u22a5 \u2261 (v1 /V1 )2 + (v2 /V2 )2 < 1,\nwhich we imply to hold below.\nIf sign(m3 )(\u03b5F \u2212 \u03b50 ) < 0, the Fermi surface has the\nshape of a neck, with the band-contact line being inside\nthe neck, Fig. 1b. Here sign(z) = 1 for z > 0, and\nsign(z) = \u22121 if z < 0. As the Fermi energy passes the\ncritical energy, sign(m3 )(\u03b5F \u2212\u03b50 ) > 0, the neck is broken,\nand immediately a new pocket appears, i.e., the Fermi\nsurface takes the self intersecting shape, with the bandcontact line still lying inside it, Fig. 1a. Thus, in the case\nof the degeneracy of the bands, the k0 is the point where\n\na) x>0\n0\nH\nMagnetization (arb. units)\n\nIn the recent experimental investigation [12] of the de\nHaas - van Alphen effect in LaRhIn5 , the oscillations\nof magnetization associated with a small cross-section\nof the Fermi surface of this metal were detected. The\nelectron cyclotron mass m\u2217 corresponding to this cross\nsection was also small as compared with electron mass\nm, |m\u2217 | \u2248 0.067m. Authors of that paper attributed\nthese oscillations to a small electron pocket of the Fermi\nsurface. Besides, in that paper the magnetization of the\nelectrons of the pocket was studied in the ultraquantum\nlimit, and the following intriguing contradiction between\nthe obtained experimental data and the existing theory\nwas discovered: Since in the ultraquantum limit the electrons occupy only the lowest Landau level, they have\nto migrate into large sheets of the Fermi surface when\nthis level is raised above the Fermi energy. Hence, the\nmagnetization M of the electrons of the pocket has to\nvanish with increasing magnetic field H. However, the\nexperimental data [12] reveal a finite contribution to the\nmagnetization even in such magnetic fields.\nIn this paper we resolve this contradiction. We show\nthat in fact a small electron group associated with a\nband-contact line was detected in Ref. 12, and the results of Ref. 12 provide the first observation of the Berry\nphase of the electrons via the de Haas - van Alphen effect.\nA small cross-section of a Fermi surface appears near\nthat point k0 of the Brillouin zone for which the two\nconditions are fulfilled: Topology of this surface changes\nat the k0 if the Fermi energy \u03b5F is shifted past some\ncritical energy \u03b50 , and this \u03b50 is close to the initial Fermi\nlevel of the crystal. In the case of the degeneracy of two\nelectron energy bands of the crystal [say \u03b5+ (k) and \u03b5\u2212 (k)]\nalong a line in the Brillouin zone, these bands near the\nk0 always can be represented in the form [13]:\n\n\u22121\n\n0.4\nb) x<0\n0\nH\n\n\u22120.4\n\n0\n\n1\n\nH/H\n\n2\n\n3\n\n1\n\nFIG. 1: The electron magnetization associated with the band\ncontact-line, Eq. (4), for x > 0 (a) and for x < 0 (b). A sign\nof x coincides with the sign of (\u03b5F \u2212\u03b50 )m3 . The electron spectrum is described by Eq. (3) with a2\u22a5 \u2261 (v1 /V1 )2 + (v2 /V2 )2 <\n1. The field H1 is given by Eq. (6). The insets show the appropriate Fermi surfaces and the extremal cross sections; the\ndash-dot lines depict the band-contact line.\n\na self intersecting Fermi surface appears (or disappears)\nat \u03b5F = \u03b50 .\nLet the magnetic field H be in the k3 direction. In this\ncase the exact Landau levels were found in a vicinity of\nthe critical energy \u03b50 [14]. Interestingly, these exact levels obtained from the appropriate Schrodinger equation\ncoincide with the semiclassical levels, given by Eq. (1)\nand \u03b3 = 0, at all n (even at n \u223c 1), and not just for\nn \u226b 1. On the basis of this spectrum, the magnetization\nM of the electrons with spectrum (3) was calculated for\nan arbitrary strength of H [14]:\n\u0010 e \u00112 23/2 |m (\u03b5 \u2212 \u03b5 )|1/2\n3 F\n0\n1/4\nM= \u2212\nH1 H 3/4 f (x), (4)\nc\n\u03c0 2 h\u0304|m\u2217 |\nwhere\n\n1/2\n\nx = sign[m3 (\u03b5F \u2212 \u03b50 )] (H1 /H)\n\n,\n\nand the universal function f (x) is completely independent of the spectrum,\n\u0013\n\u0012\nZ\n7t + 6x\n1\n1 \u221e\n\u2212 {t2 } sign(t) \u221a\n.

The\nH1 is one of the fields given by the formula,\n(6)\n\nwhere n = 1, 2, ... ; Sex is the area of the extremal cross\nsection of the Fermi surface, see Fig. 1, and the cyclotron\nmass m\u2217 is proportional to \u03b5F \u2212 \u03b50 ,\nm\u2217 =\n\n\u03b5F \u2212 \u03b50\n,\nV1 V2 (1 \u2212 a2\u22a5 )3/2\n\n(7)\n\nand is small as compared to the electron mass m at |\u03b5F \u2212\n\u03b50 | \u226a mV1 V2 \u223c 1 \u2212 10eV. The meaning of the fields Hn\nwill become clear from the subsequent analysis. Note\nthat we consider M (H) at a fixed \u03b5F since in a metal,\nlarge sheets of its Fermi surface provide so large density of\nstates that \u03b5F is practically independent of the magnetic\nfield.\nIf |x| \u226b 1, the magnetization (4) splits into the oscillation part, that completely agrees with the well-known\nLifshits-Kosevich formula [11, 15], and the smooth contribution \u03c7H, with the magnetic susceptibility \u03c7 coinciding\nwith that of Ref.13.

It is the field\nHn defined by Eq. (6) that gives the position of the peak\nat crossing \u03b5F by the n-th Landau level. Note that at\nx > 0 the oscillations of M result from the maximum\ncross section of the pocket with k3 = 0, and the peaks of\nthe magnetization are directed upward, Fig. 1a, while at\nx < 0 the oscillations result from the minimum cross section of the neck with k3 = 0, and the peaks are directed\ndownward, Fig. 1b.\nFormula (6) provides possibility to find the bandcontact lines in metals, using Shoenberg's procedure [11].\nPlotting experimental values of 1/Hn versus n, one can\nstate that a band-contact line has been detected if this\ndependence is extrapolated to the origin of the coordinate. If the \u03b3 were different from zero, the dependence\nwould be extrapolated to \u2212\u03b3. We emphasize that since\nfor the electrons near the point k0 the exact spectrum in\nthe magnetic field coincides with the semiclassical spectrum, formula (6) defines the positions of the peaks in\nM (H) not only for large n but also for n \u223c 1. Thus, it is\nsufficient to use several last oscillations of M (H) in this\ndetection. This enables one to find \u03b3 with maximal accuracy. Note also that the observation of the sharp peaks\nfor the last oscillations (n \u223c 1) is the most favorable since\n\u03b4\u03b5H \u223c |\u03b5F \u2212 \u03b50 |/n in Eq. (8).\nThe ultraquantum limit occurs when |x| \u2264 1, i.e., when\nH \u2265 H1 .

The inset shows the dependence of the experimental values of 1/Hn\n[12] on n. This dependence gives \u03b3 = 0.\n\nbe decomposed into the oscillation parts and the term\n\u03c7H [e.g., f (x) \u2248 0.156 at |x| \u226a 1]. In this case the magnetization is determined by the Landau levels of the lower\nband \u03b5\u2212 (k) which are all occupied by the electrons. It is\nimportant that at H \u223c H1 the magnetization far exceeds\nthat of the usual small pockets and necks which contain\nno band contact line. Indeed, for such the pockets and\nnecks the appropriate magnitude of M is of the order of\nthe prefactor before the function f (x) in Eq. (4), but m\u2217\nin such the situations is not proportional to \u03b5F \u2212 \u03b50 and\ngenerally is not small, m\u2217 \u223c m. Moreover, at H \u223c H1 the\nM in Eq. (4) generally is not small as compared with the\nsmooth part of the magnetization, \u03c70 H1 , caused by the\nlarge electron groups in metals. Estimating the smooth\npart of the magnetic susceptibility of the large electron\ngroups, \u03c70 , by the Landau\u221aformula for the electron gas\n[11], \u03c70 \u223c (e/c)2 (\u03b5F )1/2 /h\u0304 m, we find that at H \u223c H1 ,\nmV1 V2\nM (H)\n\u223c\n\u226b 1.\n\u03c70 H\n(\u03b5F |\u03b5F \u2212 \u03b50 |)1/2\nIn the last inequality we have assumed that mV1 V2 and\n\u03b5F are of the order of the characteristic energies in metals,\n1 \u2212 10eV.\nAbove we have neglected the spin-orbit interaction in\nthe crystal. With this interaction, the semiclassical quantization rule (1) is modifies as follows [11]:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2\u03c0eH\ngm\u2217\nS(\u03b5, kz ) =\nn+\u03b3\u00b1\n,\n(9)\nh\u0304c\n4m\nwhere \u03b3 = 1/2, and g is the so-called g factor of the electron orbit. Besides, the spin-orbit interaction generally\nlifts the degeneracy of the bands \u03b5+ (k) and \u03b5\u2212 (k). But if\n\n\f4\nthis interaction is not too strong so that the gap between\nthese bands is essentially smaller than the energy gaps\nbetween \u03b5\u00b1 (k) and other bands of the crystal, the concept of the band-contact line is still valid approximately.\nAs it was shown in our paper [16], if the semiclassical\nelectron orbit in the magnetic field surrounds such the\nband-contact line, one has g \u2248 2m/m\u2217 , and formula (9)\nis equivalent to Eq. (1) with \u03b3 = 0 for all n. In other\nwords, equation (6) for the peak positions is robust to\n\"switching on\" the spin-orbit interaction. Note that the\ng factor is large even for a very weak spin-orbit interaction, and this result is the other manifestation of the\nnonzero Berry phase (instead of \u03b3 = 0). The spin-orbit\ninteraction also modifies formula (4) [14]. However, if\nthe splitting of the bands \u03b5\u00b1 (k) is small near the point\nk0 , the modification is negligible, and it increases rather\nslowly with the strength of the spin-orbit interaction.\nWe now apply the above results to the experimental\ndata of Ref. 12. These data obtained at a low temperature (1.5 K) reveal the sharp peaks in the magnetization\nof LaRhIn5 when the magnetic field H is parallel to the\n[001] direction of this tetragonal compound, Fig. 2. The\nanalysis of the peak positions, see the inset in Fig. 2,\ngives \u03b3 = 0 [17], i.e., we conclude that the oscillations in\nthe magnetization result from some small electron group\nnear the band-contact line [18]. Using the experimental\nvalue [12] of the cyclotron mass, |m\u2217 | = 0.067m, and the\nposition of the last peak H1 \u2248 7 T, we find from Eq. (6)\nthat |\u03b5F \u2212\u03b50 | \u2248 25meV . The downward peaks mean that\nwe deal with the situation shown in Fig. 1b.\nTo verify this conclusion, we also compare the theoretical M (H) with the experimental data, Fig. 2. The experimental magnetization Mexp has been approximated\nby\nMexp (H) = \u03c70 H + M (H),\n\n(10)\n\nwhere M (H) is given by Eq. (4), while \u03c70 is the smooth\npart of the magnetic susceptibility of the large electron\ngroups in LaRhIn5 . Thus, we have only the two constants\nto fit the experimental data: the prefactor in Eq. (4), and\n\u03c70 . In Fig. 2 we show the theoretical curve calculated\nunder the condition \u03c70 H1 /M (H1 ) = 0.14. Note that\nM (H1 ) is noticeably larger than \u03c70 H1 . It is also evident\nthat the curve sufficiently well reproduces the experimental data even without any corrections to M due to the\nspin-orbit interaction.\nAlthough the band structure of LaRhIn5 was calculated in Ref. 19, the data presented in that paper do not\npermit one to find the band-contact lines in this crystal. To locate these lines, it would be well to calculate\nthe bands lying near \u03b5F over the Brillouin zone and to\ntrace the evolution of these bands with the strength of\nthe spin-orbit interaction. Such the analysis could also\nclarify one more point: It turns out that two small and\nalmost equal cross sections determine the oscillations of\n\nM in LaRhIn5 [12]. This can occur if the direction of the\nmagnetic field slightly differ from the [001] axis, and if\nthe directions of the band-contact lines at the equivalent\npoints k0 do not coincide with this axis. Note that when\nthe magnetic field is tilted away from the k3 axis, the\ncomponent H3 has to be inserted in the above formulas\n[14]. Thus, an experimental investigation of the angular\ndependences of the two cross sections could also assist in\nclarifying this result of Ref. 12.\nIn summary, we resolve the contradiction discovered\nin Ref. 12. It turns out that a small neck of the Fermi\nsurface with the band-contact line inside the neck, see the\ninset in Fig. 1b, was discovered in Ref. 12. In this case\nthe magnetization in the ultraquantum limit does not\nvanish, while the positions of the peaks in the oscillation\npart of M (H) depend on the nonzero Berry phase for the\nelectron orbits in the magnetic field. In other words, the\nresults of Ref. 12 provide essentially the first observation\nof the Berry phase via the de Haas - van Alphen effect.\n\n[1] M. V. Berry, Proc. Roy. Soc.
