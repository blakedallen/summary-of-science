Miller\nDepartment of Physics\nUniversity of Washington\nJuly 2004\n\n\f\fAbstract\nHigh energy reactions necessarily involve large momentum transfer to the target's constituents, which thus rebound near light speed. The experimentally observed correlation\nbetween initial and final states measures the system's response along the light cone. A convenient theoretical description of such reactions is light-front dynamics where the properties\nof physical states are described along the advance of a wavefront of light.\nIn this work we report on using light-front dynamics to describe generalized parton\ndistributions, which are correlation functions encountered in virtual Compton scattering\nat large momentum transfer. This two photon process requires pair annihilation contributions which are subtle to handle in light-front dynamics. We are careful to derive such\ncontributions in the light-front Bethe-Salpeter formalism. This derivation highlights the\nconnection to the Fock space picture as well as provides a toy model for generalized parton\ndistributions.\nUltimately we use light-front dynamics to build a phenomenological parametrization\nfor the proton's generalized parton distributions. This task is non-trivial due to the field\ntheoretic constraints required of these distributions. To meet the constraints imposed by\nLorentz covariance, we approach generalized parton distributions from the perspective of\ndouble distributions. Despite avid phenomenological use, surprisingly little work has been\ndone to calculate double distributions. We first focus on a number of simple pedagogical\nexamples and demonstrate how double distributions can be correctly determined. The\ndouble distributions we derive, including those for the proton, satisfy known constraints\nand are adequate for phenomenological estimates of cross sections.

the bound states of strongly interacting particles calls for a synthesis of\nrelativity and quantum mechanics. While this synthesis is afforded by quantum field theory,\nthe direct investigation of bound states from a covariant framework has been limited. Other\ncomplimentary methods are desirable for both varied intuition and differing calculational\nstrategies.\nIn a Hamiltonian approach, one attempts to calculate wavefunctions for the physical\nstates of the theory. More than a half century ago, Dirac's paper on the forms of relativistic\ndynamics [1] introduced the front-form Hamiltonian approach, which differs from conventional Hamiltonian dynamics by a relativistic boost to infinite momentum. Applications\nof this form of dynamics to quantum mechanics and field theory were overlooked at the\ntime due to the appearance of covariant perturbation theory. The reemergence of frontform dynamics was largely motivated by simplicity as well as physicality. The light-front\napproach has the largest kinematic subgroup of operators [2] of any Hamiltonian theory.\nToday the physical utility of light-front dynamics is transparent: hard scattering processes\nprobe a light-cone correlation of bound states. Not surprisingly, then, many perturbative\nQCD applications can be treated on the light front, see e.g. [3]. Outside this realm, physics\non the light cone has been extensively developed for non-perturbative QCD [4\u20137] as well as\napplied to nuclear physics [8, 9].\nIn this thesis we consider applications of light-front dynamics to generalized parton\ndistributions (GPDs). As GPDs enter into amplitudes for hard exclusive reactions, lightcone quantized fields make a natural appearance. GPDs are theoretically challenging objects\nto calculate. Even simple phenomenological parameterizations cannot be written down at\nwill [as is the case of conventional parton distributions functions (PDFs)] due to the field\ntheoretic constraints GPDs must satisfy. Ultimately we will generate a phenomenological\nparametrization for the proton's GPDs. Before doing so, however, we investigate from a few\nperspectives the difficulties inherent in describing these new distribution functions. We first\nmotivate the physicality of the light-cone framework by considering deep-inelastic scattering\nand then discuss bound states in field theory and the front form of Hamiltonian dynamics\n\n1.1\n\nDeep-inelastic scattering\n\nDeep-inelastic scattering (DIS) is the canonical hard scattering process. We shall therefore\nreview DIS in some detail in order to introduce the relevance of light-front dynamics in processes amenable to treatment in perturbative QCD. Our treatment parallels the analysis\n1\n\n\f\u0001\nk\n\nk\n\n0\n\nq\n\nP\n\nX\n\nFigure 1.1: Diagrammatic depiction of the DIS process. An electron of momentum k is\nincident on a proton of momentum P . The leading-order electromagnetic process is virtual\nphoton exchange between the electron and proton. As a result, the electron's momentum is\naltered to k\u2032 and due to the high virtuality of the photon, the proton breaks up into various\nreaction products collectively denoted by X.\nof [10,11]. We show how light-cone coordinates and the collinear approximation enable simplification of the DIS amplitude into a product of hard scattering coefficients and universal\nfunctions. The latter are the conventional parton distribution functions (PDFs). These\ndistribution functions are momentum probabilities with respect to the quark wavefunction\nof the target defined along the advance of a wavefront of light. The analysis presented\nbelow will be extended later in Chapter 3 to deeply virtual Compton scattering (DVCS).\nNonetheless, this Section gives practical motivation for the need to investigate bound states\non the light cone.\n\n1.1.1\n\nBjorken limit\n\nIn DIS off the proton, the process under consideration is electron1 scattering at large momentum transfer, namely\ne(k) + p(P ) \u2192 e(k \u2032 ) + X.\n(1.1)\n\nHere k, k\u2032 label the momenta of the initial and final electrons respectively, while P is the\nmomentum of the proton. The reaction happens at such large momentum transfer that the\nproton breaks up, as it were, and subsequently forms new hadrons. We have used X to\nlabel any of the myriad of possible final states.\nWe define the four-momentum transfered to the proton as q = k \u2212 k\u2032 . In the language\nof QED, this momentum is transfered via the virtual exchange of a photon between the\nelectron and proton, see Figure 1.1. The offshellness of the photon is given by q 2 = \u2212Q2 ,\nwhere Q2 is assumed to be very large and positive in the deep-inelastic limit. In accordance\nwith the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, the larger the momentum transfer, the smaller\nthe region probed. Hence one can view the electromagnetic process in DIS as resolving the\nstructure deep within the proton. From the electron's perspective, however, the proton is\nseverely Lorentz contracted and thus the virtual photon is only capable of resolving small\nsizes transverse to the beam direction.\nIn evaluating the cross section, we have the freedom to choose both the beam direction\nand the overall frame in which to view the scattering reaction. With a suitable orientation of\nthe beam direction and a convenient choice of reference frame, we can work simultaneously\nwith P\u22a5 \u2261 (P 1 , P 2 ) = 0 and q\u22a5 = 0. Now as is conventional, we introduce two vectors p\u03bc\n1\n\nOne can also consider muon, positron, neutrino, etc. scattering off the proton (or other) targets.\n\n2\n\n\f\u0001\nq\n\nq\n\nP\n\nP\n\nFigure 1.2: The forward virtual Compton amplitude T \u03bc\u03bd (q, P ). The dashed line denotes\nthe cut that yields the imaginary part needed for the DIS cross section.\nand n\u03bc into which we decompose the remaining momenta. Explicitly these vectors are\n\nand\n\n\u039b\np\u03bc = \u221a (1, 0, 0, 1)\n2\n\n(1.2)\n\n1\nn\u03bc = \u221a (1, 0, 0, \u22121),\n2\u039b\n\n(1.3)\n\nwhere \u039b is an unfixed parameter associated with the unexploited freedom to boost along\nthe \u1e91-direction. Notice both vectors are lightlike: p2 = n2 = 0. Additionally their product\nis p * n = 1.\nIn terms of these p and n vectors, the proton's momentum appears as\nP \u03bc = p\u03bc +\n\nM2 \u03bc\nn ,\n2\n\n(1.4)\n\n\u221a\nso that P 2 = M 2 . In the proton's rest frame, \u039b = M/ 2. In this frame we define the\nenergy of the virtual photon q 0 = \u03bd and hence P * q = M \u03bd. The photon's momentum in the\nproton rest frame is thus\np\nq \u03bc = (\u03bd, 0, 0, \u2212 Q2 + \u03bd 2 )\n(1.5)\n\nbecause the virtuality is q 2 = \u2212Q2 .\nLastly we define the Lorentz invariant Bjorken variable x\nx=\u2212\n\nq2\n.\n2P * q\n\n(1.6)\n\nIn the proton rest frame, we have x = Q2 /2M \u03bd. In the limit of elastic proton-electron\nscattering x is fixed by momentum conservation, x = 1. For a general inelastic process, x\nis kinematically restricted to \u2208 (0, 1]. Notice in particular this implies \u03bd 2 \u226b Q2 . In DIS,\none refers to the Bjorken limit in which Q2 \u2192 \u221e while x remains fixed by the kinematics.\nIn this limit the doubly differential cross section for the reaction in Eq. (1.1) has the form\n\u03b12E E \u2032 \u03bc\u03bd\nd2 \u03c3\nL (k, q)W\u03bc\u03bd (q, P ),\n=\ndE \u2032 d\u03a9\u2032\nM Q4 E\n\n(1.7)\n\nwhere we have included only the leading-order electromagnetic contribution from one photon\nexchange. Here E \u2032 is the final electron energy and d\u03a9\u2032 its differential solid angle, while E is\nthe initial electron energy. L\u03bc\u03bd (k, q) is the leptonic tensor representing the QED amplitude\n3\n\n\fsquared for virtual photon emission off the electron line and \u03b1E is the electromagnetic\nfine-structure constant. The unknown quantity in the cross section is the hadronic tensor\nW \u03bc\u03bd (q, P ) which denotes the amplitude squared for the virtual photon-proton interaction.\nThe hadronic reaction products X, however, are not observed in inclusive DIS and are\naccordingly summed over in W \u03bc\u03bd (q, P ). Thus we utilize the optical theorem\nW \u03bc\u03bd (q, P ) = \u2212\n\n1\nIm [T \u03bc\u03bd (q, P )]\n2\u03c0\n\n(1.8)\n\nto relate W \u03bc\u03bd (q, P ) to the forward virtual Compton amplitude T \u03bc\u03bd (q, P ) that is depicted\nin Figure 1.2. In terms of the Heisenberg current operator J \u03bc (y), T \u03bc\u03bd (q, P ) can be written\nas the diagonal proton matrix element of the time-ordered product of two currents, namely\nZ\nn\no\n\u03bc\u03bd\nT (q, P ) = i d4 y eiq*y hP |T J \u03bc (y)J \u03bd (0) |P i.\n(1.9)\n\n1.1.2\n\nCollinear approximation\n\nAbove we have defined the kinematics of DIS and written the experimentally observed crosssection in terms of the forward virtual Compton amplitude T \u03bc\u03bd (q, P ). We now proceed to\nisolate the leading contribution to T \u03bc\u03bd (q, P ) in perturbative QCD.2 Large momentum q flows\nthrough the diagram depicted in Figure 1.2. Since T \u03bc\u03bd (q, P ) is a Fourier transform, most\ncontributions are averaged out as q 2 \u2192 \u2212\u221e. Indeed the only non-vanishing contributions\nthat remain arise from singularities in the product of current operators as y 2 \u2192 0.\nDue to the nature of the QCD running coupling, at large momentum transfer the highly\nvirtual photon couples to asymptotically free quarks. Asymptotic freedom justifies the\nuse of the impulse approximation for the product of currents and the so called handbag\ndominance emerges (see Figure 1.3). More rigorously, the handbag mechanism picks out\nthe leading singularity as y 2 \u2192 0 in Eq. (1.9). The handbag contribution to W \u03bc\u03bd (q, P ) is\nthus3\n\u001a Z\n\u0014\n\u0015\u001b\nd4 k\ni(/k + q/)\n1\n\u03bc\n\u03bd\n\u03bc\u03bd\nIm i\nTr \u03b3\n\u03b3 M (k, P )\n(1.10)\nW (q, P ) =\n2\u03c0\n(2\u03c0)4\n(k + q)2 + i\u03b5\nalong with an additive similar contribution from the crossed handbag. The matrix element\nM (k, P ) in the above expression is the forward free-quark proton scattering amplitude given\nby\nZ\no\nn\n(1.11)\nM\u03b1\u03b2 (k, P ) = d4 y eik*y hP |T \u03c8 \u03b2 (0)\u03c8\u03b1 (y) |P i,\n\nwhere \u03b1 and \u03b2 are Dirac indices.\nLastly we need to isolate the dominant contribution from the matrix element M (k, P )\nin the Bjorken limit. To do this we decompose the active quark momentum k\u03bc in terms of\nthe light-cone vectors p\u03bc and n\u03bc , viz.\nk\u03bc = (k * n) p\u03bc + (k * p) n\u03bc + k\u03bc\u22a5 ,\n\n(1.12)\n\n2\nThroughout this work, we shall work only to leading order in the strong coupling. Important points\nconcerning O(\u03b1s ) corrections are contained in footnotes such as this. For a comprehensive discussion of\nperturbative QCD corrections to DIS, see e.g. [11].\n3\nQuark masses have been neglected in the propagator with large momentum flow. The restriction\n2\nmq /Q2 \u226a 1 automatically follows from M 2 /Q2 \u226a 1, which, as we shall see, is the natural scale separation condition in DIS.\n\n4\n\n\fq\n\nP\n\nq\n\nP\n\nFigure 1.3: Graphical depiction of the handbag mechanism in DIS. Due to asymptotic\nfreedom, the forward virtual Compton amplitude is dominated by free quark scattering.\nThere are two contributions: the handbag shown on the left, and the crossed bag shown on\nthe right. Figure adapted from [12].\nand analyze the situation in each momentum channel. The situation is the simplest with\nrespect to the transverse component. There, the photon carries no transverse momentum\nand so the active quark's transverse momentum is unchanged after interaction. In the p\u03bc\ndirection, the photon adds q * n = \u2212x to the active quark's momentum forcing the final\nmomentum to be k * n \u2212 x. Lastly in the n\u03bc direction, the photon adds q * p \u2248 \u221e and the\nrebounding quark has nearly infinite momentum in the n\u03bc channel. Thus relative to this\n\u22a5\ndirection the struck quark has effectively\nR zero momentum, i.e. k \u2248 0 and k * n \u2212 x \u2248 0.\nThe latter we enforce by inserting 1 = dx \u03b4(x \u2212 k * n). Our analysis leads to the collinear\napproximation to the active quark's momentum\nk\u03bc \u2248 (k * n) p\u03bc ,\n\n(1.13)\n\nbecause the transverse momentum is effectively zero and after interaction with the photon\nthe n\u03bc component is infinite, which leads to suppression of the matrix element. In the\ncollinear approximation, we have the resulting contribution to W \u03bc\u03bd (q, P )\n\u0014\n\u001aZ\n\u0015\u001b\nx/p + q/\n1\n\u03bd\ndx Tr \u03b3 \u03bc\n\u03b3\nM\n(x)\n.\n(1.14)\nW \u03bc\u03bd (q, P ) = \u2212 Im\n\u03b1\u03b2\n2\u03c0\n(xp + q)2 + i\u03b5\nAbove we have reduced the free-quark proton Green's function M (k, P ) into a function\nof only4 Bjorken x\nZ\nd4 k\n\u03b4(x \u2212 k * n)M\u03b1\u03b2 (k, P ).\n(1.15)\nM\u03b1\u03b2 (x) \u2261\n(2\u03c0)4\nIn this form, the integral over y in Eq. (1.11) can be performed trivially. We arrive at\nZ\nd\u03bb i\u03bbx\n(1.16)\nM\u03b1\u03b2 (x) =\ne hP |\u03c8 \u03b2 (0)\u03c8\u03b1 (\u03bbn)|P i,\n2\u03c0\n\n4\nThis statement and the factorization in Eq. (1.14) are modified by O(\u03b1s ) corrections. These arise from\nperturbative gluon interactions which lead to renormalization scale dependence, i.e. M\u03b1\u03b2 = M\u03b1\u03b2 (x, \u03bc2 ).\nPhysically \u03bc is the scale at which the partons are resolved. Consequently the notion of a parton is renormalization scale and scheme dependent. The Compton amplitude W \u03bc\u03bd (q, P ) remains scale independent because\nthe O(\u03b1s ) corrections to the hard scattering kernel in Eq. (1.14) exactly compensate for the \u03bc dependence\nin the quark-proton Green's function.\n\n5\n\n\fhere we have used \u03bbn to denote evaluation at the position y \u03bc = \u03bbn\u03bc . Thus the DIS\nscattering cross-section depends upon a correlation function containing\n\u221a two quark fields\nwith a lightlike separation (above the resulting separation is y \u2212 = \u03bb/ 2\u039b, y + = 0, and\ny\u22a5 = 0). This means that the relevant part of the quark propagator in DIS is only that\nalong the light cone. Consequently the amplitude depends upon a correlation of proton\nstates along the light cone and inherent to DIS is the system's response along the advance\nof a wavefront of light. Furthermore, as a result of the collinear approximation Eq. (1.13),\nthe active quark's plus momentum is a fraction of the proton's, i.e., k+ = xP + .\nFor unpolarized DIS, we can decompose the Dirac structure of the light-cone correlator\nM (x) into p\u03bc and n\u03bc vectors\n1\n1\n/\u03b1\u03b2 f1 (x) + M 2 /n\u03b1\u03b2 f4 (x).\nM\u03b1\u03b2 (x) = p\n2\n2\nTaking the trace of M (x) with /p and n\n/ separately, we deduce\nZ\n\u0002\n\u0003\nd\u03bb i\u03bbx\ne hP |\u03c8(0)\u03b3 \u03bc \u03c8(\u03bbn)|P i = 2 f1 (x) p\u03bc + M 2 f4 (x) n\u03bc .\n2\u03c0\n\n(1.17)\n\n(1.18)\n\nNow since both n2 and p2 are zero, and n *p = 1, contributions to the DIS cross section from\n2\nthe f4 (x) structure function must come out proportional to M\nf (x) at the end of the day.\nQ2 4\nOne can neglect this structure due to the power-law suppression in the Bjorken limit.5 This\nsimplification is a peculiarity of the light-cone power counting6 because the overall matrix\nelement has one mass dimension but two irreducible structure functions.\nTo summarize, we have reduced the virtual forward Compton amplitude in the Bjorken\nlimit to one unknown structure function f1 (x). In terms of proton matrix elements, this\nstructure function is\nZ\nd\u03bb i\u03bbx\n1\n(1.19)\ne hP |\u03c8(0)\u03b3 + \u03c8(\u03bbn)|P i.\nf1 (x) =\n2\n2\u03c0\nConventionally f1 (x) is referred to as a parton distribution function (PDF). This is technically only true in light-cone quantization in light-cone gauge (see Appendix C). Nevertheless, to adequately model and physically interpret the PDF as a distribution one needs\nto know properties of the bound state (here the proton) on the light front. Such properties\nare encoded in the light-cone wavefunctions. We shall give a preliminary introduction to\nthese light-cone wavefunctions in Section 1.2.\n\n1.1.3\n\nPower counting with a twist\n\nAbove we have reviewed DIS in a manner intrinsically tied to the light cone. This will\nguide us throughout the first few Chapters as we investigate properties of bound states\nand wavefunctions on the light cone. There exists an alternate, covariant way to view\nDIS structure functions that will be required in the later Chapters when we take up the\ncalculation of double distributions (DDs). Moreover this covariant representation will allow\nus some insight as to the peculiarities of light-cone power counting. Instead of re-deriving\n5\n\nThis statement is not altered by perturbative QCD corrections. Indeed Eq. (1.18) is modified to include\nscale dependence, but the structure functions f1 (x, \u03bc2 ) and f4 (x, \u03bc2 ) do not mix under evolution.\n6\nNotice the vector p\u03bc has only a minus component and hence projects out the plus component of a vector\ndotted into it, while the n\u03bc vector has only a plus component and projects out the minus component. In\nolder terminology, p\u03bc gives one the good components, while n\u03bc gives one the bad components.\n\n6\n\n\fDIS amplitudes in the new framework, we shall take our result above Eq. (1.19) and merely\nextract from it a new perspective.\nConsider the nth moment of the PDF f1 (x). We can write it in the form\n\u0014\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0015\nZ\nZ\nZ\nd\u03bb\n1\nd n i\u03bbx\nn\ne\ndx x f1 (x) =\ndx\n\u2212i\nhP |\u03c8(0)\u03b3 + \u03c8(\u03bbn)|P i.\n(1.20)\n2\n2\u03c0\nd\u03bb\nPerforming\nby parts enables evaluation of the x-integral, which finally apR dxn-integrations\ni\u03bbx\npears as 2\u03c0 e = \u03b4(\u03bb). Thus we have\nZ\n1\ndx xn f1 (x) = n\u03bc n\u03bc1 . . . n\u03bcn hP |\u03c8(0)\u03b3 \u03bc (i\u2202 \u03bc1 ) * * * (i\u2202 \u03bcn )\u03c8(0)|P i.\n(1.21)\n2\nThis suggests we consider the tower of local operators O(n) defined by\n\u2194\n\n\u2194\n\nO\u03bc\u03bc1 ...\u03bcn = \u03c8(0)\u03b3 {\u03bc iD \u03bc1 * * * iD \u03bcn } \u03c8(0),\n\n(1.22)\n\nwhere the action of {...} on Lorentz indices produces the symmetric traceless part of the\ntensor. The derivative D \u03bc = \u2202 \u03bc +igA\u03bc is the QCD gauge covariant derivative. In extracting\nthe form of O(n) in Eq. (1.22) from Eq. (1.21), we made a number of trivial modifications\n\u2194\n\n\u2192\n\n\u2190\n\nfor free. Firstly we made the partial derivative act symmetrically \u2202 = \u2202 \u2212 \u2202 since the \u03c8\nfield has no \u03bb dependence in Eq. (1.19). Next we upgraded the partial derivatives to gauge\ncovariant derivatives to render the tower of operators O(n) gauge invariant. Symmetrization\nwith respect to all Lorentz indices was also done at no cost since the prefactor of (n + 1)-n\u03bc\nvectors in Eq. (1.21) filters out the symmetric part of the tensor operators. Notice that\nsymmetrization allows us to identify the operator O(1) with the quark part of the QCD\nenergy-momentum tensor. Lastly tracelessness, which allows us to classify O(n) irreducibly\nas spin-(n + 1) operators, is a free choice since any trace terms are proportional to g\u03bci \u03bcj\nand must vanish when contracted with n\u03bci n\u03bcj since n2 = 0.\nNow we merely observe that because of Lorentz invariance, proton matrix elements of\nthe O(n) operators have the form\nhP |O\u03bc\u03bc1 ...\u03bcn |P i = 2an P {\u03bc P \u03bc1 * * * P \u03bcn } ,\nwhere an is a Lorentz scalar.7 Recall that n * P = n * p = 1. Thus we have\nZ\ndx xn f1 (x) = an .\n\n(1.23)\n\n(1.24)\n\nMoments of PDFs are proton matrix elements of local operators O(n) . A natural question\nto ask, however, is why there are infinitely many such operators. Power counting seems to\nsuggest that more P \u03bc 's in Eq. (1.23) means more suppression in the Bjorken limit.\nThe resolution of this paradox (and also the peculiarities of light-cone power counting)\ninvolves fully appreciating the nature of the Bjorken limit. Let us denote an arbitrary\noperator of mass dimension d and spin s as O(d, s). Unpolarized proton matrix elements\nof this operator will pick up s-powers of P due to Lorentz covariance. But the net effect on\n7\n\nIn general an = an (\u03bc2 ). As an alternative to our above discussion of DIS, we can view the scale\ndependence as arising from the renormalization of the composite operators in Eq. (1.22).

The function f4 (x)\nencountered above is a twist-4 contribution. In summary, the calculation of model quark\ndistributions from their moments is an interesting study of the interplay between the lightcone formalism and covariance. We shall take this much further in Chapters 4 and 5, where\nwe obtain model double distribution functions.\n\n1.2\n\nBound states\n\nAbove we have reviewed DIS from two perspectives: a covariant development formulated\nin terms of matrix elements of local twist-2 operators, and also from the perspective of\ndynamics along the light cone. For applications throughout the rest of this work, we need\nto introduce light-cone wavefunctions and investigate how the features of covariant field\ntheory manifest themselves in the many-body light-cone wavefunctions. To this end, we\nfirst discuss in Section 1.2.1 two-body bound states in covariant field theory. Next in\nSection 1.2.2 we provide an exactly soluble model wherein one can compare the covariant,\nlight-cone and familiar instant form wavefunctions. This involves solving for the model's\nwavefunction in the rest frame and then boosting to an arbitrary frame.\n\n1.2.1\n\nBethe-Salpeter equation\n\nIn terms of fully covariant operators, the Lippmann-Schwinger equation for the two-particle\ntransition matrix T appears as\nT = V + V GT.\n(1.27)\n8\n\nThe renormalization of these operators does not modify the twist expansion because operators of different\ntwist do not mix under evolution. One has the additional feature, however, that operators of the same twist\n(and quantum numbers) do mix under evolution, e.g. to O(\u03b1s ) one must consider mixing of O(n) above with\nthe twist-two gluon operators\n\u2194\n\n\u2194\n\nOg\u03bc\u03bc1 ...\u03bcn \u03bd = F \u03b1{\u03bc iD\u03bc1 * * * iD \u03bcn F \u03bd} \u03b1 .\n\n8\n\n\f\u0003\n\u0001\u0002\n=\n\n\u0001\u0001\u0001\n\nFigure 1.5: Bethe-Salpeter equation for a point interaction. The state is bound by the\ninfinite chain of bubbles.\nAbove, V is the irreducible two-particle scattering kernel and G is the completely disconnected two-particle propagator (which is merely the product of two single-particle propagators). A pole in the T -matrix (at some R2 = M 2 , say) corresponds to a two-particle bound\nstate. Investigation of the pole's residue gives an equation for the bound state vertex \u0393\n\u0393 = V G\u0393.\n\n(1.28)\n\nThe amplitude \u03a8 is defined as G\u0393 and hence satisfies a similar equation, the Bethe-Salpeter\nequation [13\u201315]\n\u03a8 = GV \u03a8.\n(1.29)\nFollowing [16], it is convenient to denote quantities able to be rendered in position or\nmomentum space with bras and kets. We will employ this notation only for quantities\nthat have been stripped of their overall momentum-conserving delta functions, for example\n\u0393(k, R) is defined by \u0393(k, R) = hk|\u0393R i. Here we have used R as a label for the bound\nstate for which R2 = M 2 , and k labels the four momentum of the first particle. The same\nis analogously true for \u03a8(k, R). For the disconnected two-particle propagator, we define\nfirst G(R) which is the disconnected propagator of total momentum R defined through\nthe relation hR\u2032 |G|Ri = (2\u03c0)4 \u03b4(4) (R\u2032 \u2212 R)G(R). Additionally we remove the momentum\nconserving delta function between initial and final states of particle one in the disconnected Green's function to arrive at G(k, R), i.e. hk|G(R)|pi = (2\u03c0)4 \u03b4(4) (k \u2212 p)G(k, R).\nUsing hR\u2032 |V |Ri = (2\u03c0)4 \u03b4(4) (R \u2212 R\u2032 )V (R), we see the momentum-space kernel V (k, p; R) is\nV (k, p; R) = hk|V (R)|pi. Thus rendered in momentum space, the Bethe-Salpeter equation\n(1.29) reads (see Figure 1.4)\nZ\nd4 p\nG(k, R)V (k, p; R)\u03a8(p, R).\n(1.30)\n\u03a8(k, R) =\n(2\u03c0)4\nArmed with the Bethe-Salpeter amplitude \u03a8, one can calculate field-theoretic boundstate matrix elements by taking the appropriate residues of four-point Green's functions.\nThese matrix elements may ultimately require knowledge of higher-point functions which\nthen must be solved for consistently in the same dynamics. The Bethe-Salpeter amplitude \u03a8\nis in some ways the covariant analogue of the Schr\u00f6dinger wavefunction. While the features\nof relativistic field theory (in particular: particle creation and annihilation, retardation\neffects. . .) make the exact analogy impossible, in the non-relativistic limit, one can show\nthat the BSE reduces to the Schr\u00f6dinger equation.\n\n1.2.2\n\nToy wavefunction and boost\n\nAbove we have derived the covariant BSE for two-body bound states. In this Section, we\nconsider a toy model for the BSE that is exactly soluble. We shall for simplicity consider a\nscalar bound state composed of two scalar particles. The solution will enable us to compare\n9\n\n\fand contrast instant form dynamics and light-front dynamics all while maintaining exact\ncovariance. The instant and front form of dynamics are reviewed in Appendix B.\nOne can obtain the simplest soluble BSE equation by choosing a point-like interaction\nfor V (k, p; R) in Eq. (1.30), namely V (k, p; R) = ig, where g is a coupling constant. The\ntwo scalar particles that make up the scalar bound state thus interact infinitely many\ntimes according to the BSE to bind the state. For a point-like interaction, a bubble chain is\ngenerated by the BSE and is shown in Figure 1.5. With this choice of interaction, the bound\nstate equation simplifies tremendously. Since the kernel is independent of momentum, the\nonly p dependence that remains in Eq. (1.30) is in \u03a8(p, R) and this quantity is subsequently\nintegrated over all p. The integration merely produces some number that can be absorbed\ninto the overall normalization of the wavefunction (along with the coupling constant in the\nkernel). Thus we are left with the solution\n\u03a8(k, R) = iG(k, R),\n\n(1.31)\n\nwhere the overall constant is a matter of taste. Comparing with Eq. (1.28), we can also\ntrivially solve for the bound state vertex function: \u0393(k, R) = i. We shall see later that\na point-like vertex is a convenient choice for phenomenological applications because the\ncrossing properties are trivial. The Bethe-Salpeter equation for \u0393(k, R) determines the\nmass M 2 = R2 of the bound state via the consistency equation\nZ\nd4 p\nG(k, R).\n(1.32)\n1 = ig\n(2\u03c0)4\n\nNow for simplicity we shall neglect self-energy contributions in the propagators and\nchoose the single particle propagator to have the basic Klein-Gordon form. The two-particle\ndisconnected propagator is a product of these Klein-Gordon propagators and hence by virtue\nof Eq. (1.31) the covariant wavefunction is\n\u03a8(k, R) = \u2212i[k2 \u2212 m2 + i\u03b5]\u22121 [(k \u2212 R)2 \u2212 m2 + i\u03b5]\u22121 .\n\n(1.33)\n\nHere we have labeled the constituent mass by m. If we imagine taking the Fourier transform\nof this wavefunction, we have a four-dimensional analogue of the Schr\u00f6dinger wave function.\nThere is an important distinction, however. We also know the time dependence of the\nwave function-the time evolution governed by the Hamiltonian operator is automatically\nincluded because of the necessity of covariance. Moreover, we know from the Poincar\u00e9\nalgebra that there are other dynamical operators besides the energy9 . As to which operators\nare Hamiltonians and thus which are kinematical depends upon the form of dynamics chosen.\nThe instant and front forms are reviewed in Appendix B. We shall consider first the familiar\ninstant form.\nIn the instant form of dynamics, the energy and the Lorentz boosts are the dynamical\noperators. The initial conditions are specified on the boundary x0 = 0, as in classical and\nquantum mechanics. The time evolution of the system is governed by the energy operator\nand involves non-trivial effects due to the system's dynamics. Moreover the relativistic\nproperties of the system also are complicated by the dynamics in the instant form. This is\nreflected in the fact that the generators of Lorentz boosts are Hamiltonians. If we write out\nthe Fourier transform of the Bethe-Salpeter wavefunction\nZ 4\nd k ix*k\ne\n\u03a8(k, R),\n(1.34)\n\u03a8(x, R) =\n2\u03c0\n9\nDirac advocated the use of \"Hamiltonian\" for all operators that are dynamical, of which the energy\noperator is one.\n\n10\n\n\fwe see that the instant form wavefunction can be obtained by integration over the energy\nk0 . Thus at time x0 = 0 and in the rest frame of the bound state, we have\nZ\ndk 0\n0\n\u03c8 (k, 0) =\n.\n(1.35)\n\u03a8(k, R) \u03bc\n2\u03c0\nR =(M,0)\nGiven our solution to the BSE Eq. (1.31), we can carry out this projection onto the\ninitial surface. The integration can be done using the residue theorem bearing in mind the\nfour poles of the integrand\np\n0\n(1.36)\n= \u00b1 k2 + m2 \u2213 i\u03b5\nka,a\np\n0\nkb,b\n(1.37)\n= M \u00b1 k2 + m2 \u2213 i\u03b5.\n\nThe instant form wavefunction is 2\u03c0i[Res(ka0 ) + Res(kb0 )]. Explicitly we have\n\u03c8 0 (k, 0) = \u221a\n\nk2\n\n1\n1\n2\n2\n+ m M \u2212 4(k2 + m2 )\n\n(1.38)\n\nand overall multiplicative constants have been neglected. Notice the wavefunction is manifestly rotationally invariant. This is indicative of the kinematic nature of the generators of\nrotations in the instant form.\nFrom the point of view of relativistic quantum mechanics, one might wonder what the\nwavefunction is in an arbitrary frame. For example, in considering electromagnetic form\nfactors, the final state is boosted relative to the initial one and thus to model the form\nfactors phenomenologically, one requires knowledge of the boost. To deduce the boosted\nwavefunction, one must solve the complicated dynamical equation\n|\u03c8 0 (k, R)i = eiK*R |\u03c8 0 (k, 0)i,\n\n(1.39)\n\nwhere K are the generators of Lorentz boosts. For any three-vector k, let us define E(k) =\n\u221a\nk2 + m2 . The boosted wavefunction which solves Eq. (1.39) can be compactly written as\n1\n\u03c8 0 (k, R) =\nE(R) + E(k) \u2212 E(R \u2212 k)\n\n(\n\n1\n\u0002\n\u0003\nE(k) E(R) + E(k) + E(R \u2212 k)\n\n1\n\u0002\n\u0003\n+\nE(R \u2212 k) E(R) \u2212 E(k) \u2212 E(R \u2212 k)\n\n)\n\n. (1.40)\n\nTo obtain the boosted wavefunction, we chose not solve Eq. (1.39). We merely returned\nto the covariant Bethe-Salpeter wavefunction and evaluated it at x0 = 0 using Eq. (1.35)\nin an arbitrary frame. The non-transparent relation between the rest frame wavefunction\nEq. (1.38) and the boosted wavefunction Eq. (1.40) indicates the dynamical nature of the\nboost.\nIn the front form of dynamics, one is interested in the properties of physical states along\nthe advance of a wavefront of light. The objects of front form dynamics are the light-cone\nwave functions which are projections onto the initial surface x+ = 0. In analogy with the\ninstant form, one refers to x+ as light-cone time, and its Fourier conjugate k\u2212 as light-front\nenergy. In the front form, the energy is a Hamiltonian along with two rotation operators\ncorresponding to two independent rotations of the wavefront of light. In contrast with the\ninstant form, light-front Lorentz boosts are kinematical.\n11\n\n\fBy virtue of Eq. (1.34), the light-cone wavefunction is\nZ\ndk\u2212\n)\n=\n\u03c8(x, k\u22a5\n\u03a8(k, R),\nrel\n2\u03c0\n\n(1.41)\n\nwhere x is the fraction of the plus momentum carried by the first particle, x = k+ /R+\n\u22a5\n\u22a5\nand the relative transverse momentum is k\u22a5\nrel = k \u2212 xR . Evaluation of the integral is\nstandard and actually simpler than in the instant form because, on the light-cone, there are\nonly two energy poles. Taking the appropriate residue, the light-cone wave function for our\ntoy model is\n1\n\u03b8[x(1 \u2212 x)]\n\u03c8(x, k\u22a5\n.\n(1.42)\nrel ) =\n2\n2\nR+ x(1 \u2212 x) M 2 \u2212 k\u22a5\nrel +m\nx(1\u2212x)\n\nNotice the wave function maintains only a cylindrical symmetry and further that the relation\nof the rest frame wave function to the boosted wavefunction is all compactly written above in\nterms of k\u22a5\nrel . These facts are of course indicative of the kinematic subgroup of the Poincar\u00e9\ngenerators (the subgroup includes rotation within the initial surface and light-front boosts).\nAccordingly the full rotational symmetry of the rest frame wavefunction is not manifest, cf\nEq. (1.38) and Eq. (1.31).\nOne should now inquire as to how the two wavefunctions \u03c8 0 and \u03c8 are related to each\nother. We can try to turn the light-cone wavefunction into the rest frame wavefunction. In\nthe literature, this is accomplished by introducing an auxiliary variable k3 . So that k3 has\na physical interpretation in terms of the z-component of momentum, one uses the two-body\ncenter of mass relation\nx=\n\n1\nk3\nk+\nq\n.\n=\n+\nR+\n2 2 k2 + (k3 )2 + m2\n\u22a5\n\n(1.43)\n\nHere R+ is taken to be the sum of the free constituents' plus momentum. There is no\nbinding effect in the total plus momentum because longitudinal translations are kinematic\nin the front form of dynamics. Inverted this relation between x and k 3 reads [17]\n\u0013s 2\n\u0012\nk\u22a5 + m2\n1\n3\n.\n(1.44)\nk = x\u2212\n2\nx(1 \u2212 x)\nSimple algebra yields the relation\nx(1 \u2212 x) =\n\nk2\u22a5 + m2\n4E(k2 )\n\n(1.45)\n\nfrom which we deduce\n\u03c8(k3 , k\u22a5 ) =\n\nE(k)2\n1\n.\n2\n2\n2\nk\u22a5 + m M \u2212 4E(k)2\n\n(1.46)\n\nThis bears a resemblance to the instant form wavefunction in the rest frame Eq. (1.38). If\nwe include the Jacobian\nk2\u22a5 + m2\n\u2202x\n=\n(1.47)\n\u2202k 3\n2E(k)3\nas a multiplicative prefactor, then the wavefunctions\nagree. There is, however, no reason\nq\n\u2202x\nwhy this should work: only a factor of\nis justified to preserve the norm. When\n\u2202k 3\n12\n\n\fone considers not the wavefunctions themselves but the relevant amplitudes, enforcing the\nconstraint of Poincar\u00e9 invariance on the physical amplitude can lead to the proper\nq factors\n\n\u2202x\nto include, e.g. for form factors in the Drell-Yan frame the proper factor is\n. The\n\u2202k 3\nvariable transformation Eq. (1.44) is additionally convenient for the evaluation of integrals.\nNotice, the light-cone wavefunction itself can be evaluated in the rest frame, however, it is\nnot connected to the rest frame wavefunction in the instant form by a non-singular boost.\nFor amplitudes involving a fixed number of particles, the above correspondence Eq. (1.44)\ncan be used along with constraints from Poincar\u00e9 covariance to determine the relation to\nthe instant form rest-frame wavefunction. In general, however, there is no relation between\nfield theoretic amplitudes and Poincar\u00e9 covariant representations of relativistic dynamics.\nWhile there is no general way to unboost the light-cone wavefunctions, the instant form\nwavefunction \u03c8 0 (k, R) can be boosted to the infinite momentum frame (IMF). As a result of\nthis procedure, one recovers the light-cone wavefunction \u03c8(x, k\u22a5 ). Originally field theories\nwere re-formulated in the infinite momentum frame [18\u201321] as a way to simplify covariant\nperturbation theory. The connection to light-cone quantization was made later.\nTo boost the wavefunction to infinite momentum, we first simplify matters by choosing\n\u22a5\nR = 0. In the IMF, R3 \u2192 \u221e while R2 = M 2 is kept fixed. Thus one has\n\u0015\n\u0014\nM2\n0\n3\n+ ...\n(1.48)\nR =R 1+\n2(R3 )2\n\u221a\n\u221a\nNotice in this limit, we have R+ \u2248 2R3 \u2192 \u221e while R\u2212 \u2248 M 2 /2 2R3 \u2192 0.\nWorking with the constituent's momentum, we use the parametrization\n\nk = k\u22a5 + xR3 \u1e91.\n\n(1.49)\n\nThe energy factors then simplify in the IMF as\nk2\u22a5 + m2\n+ ...\n2xR3\nk2 + m2\n+ ....\nE(R \u2212 k) = (1 \u2212 x)R3 + \u22a5\n2(1 \u2212 x)R3\nE(k) = xR3 +\n\n(1.50)\n(1.51)\n\nCarrying out the boost to infinite momentum on the wavefunction in Eq. (1.40) yields the\nIMF wavefunction which we denote \u03c8 0 (k, \u221e). Using Eqs. (1.50) and (1.51) we find\n\u03c8 0 (k, \u221e) =\n\n1\n\n1\nR3 x(1\n\n\u2212 x) M 2 \u2212\n\nk2\u22a5 +m2\nx(1\u2212x)\n\n,\n\n(1.52)\n\nwhich since R+ \u221d R3 is just the light-cone wavefunction evaluated for R\u22a5 = 0. Unboosting\nthe wavefunctions from the IMF is generally impossible but can be done in the context of a\nfew specific amplitudes for which a correspondence between relativistic quantum mechanics\nand field theory can be made.\nIn summary, this simple covariant model for the BSE Eq. (1.31) has allowed us to\nexplore both the instant and front form wavefunctions. We saw how the structure of these\nwavefunctions is related to the respective kinematic subgroups of the Poincar\u00e9 algebra.\nMoreover, a fully covariant starting point allowed us a simple way to correctly formulate\nthe three-dimensional dynamics. We shall employ this philosophy throughout the work.\n\n13\n\n\fChapter 2\n\nLight-Front Bethe-Salpeter\nEquation\nAbove we have seen the utility of light-front dynamics in processes at large momentum\ntransfer. Additionally we investigated the properties of light-cone wavefunctions in a simple exactly soluble model for the covariant BSE. This Chapter concerns bound states of two\nparticles in the light-front formalism, specifically of interest are current matrix elements between bound states. We approach the topic, however, from covariant perturbation theory in\norder to dispel rampant misconceptions about bound states on the light front. As demonstrated by the tremendous undertaking of [22, 23], one can derive light-front perturbation\ntheory for scattering states by projecting covariant perturbation theory onto the light cone,\nthereby demonstrating their equivalence-including the delicate issue of renormalization.\nAs to the issue of light-front bound states, a reduction scheme for the Bethe-Salpeter equation recently appeared [16, 24] that produces a kernel calculated in light-front perturbation\ntheory. This reduction scheme makes formal earlier observations about the connection between the Bethe-Salpeter equation and the light-front bound state equation [25]. For the\npurpose of simplicity, in this Chapter we consider only bound states of two scalar particles\ninteracting via the exchange of a massive scalar in the (1 + 1)-dimensional ladder model.\nOur main consideration is to extend the reduction to current matrix elements to investigate carefully valence and non-valence contributions in the light-front Bethe-Salpeter\nformalism. To do this, we calculate our model's form factor. As calculations in the lightfront reduction are covariant only when summed to all orders, our results violate Lorentz\nsymmetry and we choose to extract the form factor from the plus-component of the electromagnetic current in order to make contact with the Fock space representation. Moreover,\nin calculating (1 + 1)-dimensional form factors we cannot choose a frame of reference where\nZ-graphs vanish. This enables us to investigate their contribution, which in (3 + 1) dimensions has a variety of applications such as to generalized parton distributions, which we will\ndetail in Chapter 3. Z-graph contributions haunt light-front dynamics since non-valence\nproperties of the bound state are involved, so that valence wavefunction models cannot be\nutilized directly. On one hand, the light-cone Fock representation provides expressions for\nthe Z-graph contributions in terms of Fock component overlaps which are non-diagonal in\nparticle number [26, 27]. While on the other hand, vertices which cannot be related to the\nvalence wavefunction (coined as non-wavefunction vertices in [28]) appear in the light-front\nBethe-Salpeter formalism. A variety of ways have been proposed for dealing with these\nnon-wavefunction vertices [29,30] including attempts to model the covariant vertex [31,32],\n\n14\n\n\for (when possible) estimating the contribution from higher Fock states [33]. In a Poincar\u00e9\ncovariant framework, Z-graph contributions involve a dynamical light-front rotation and\nrepresent a similar formidable problem.\nBelow we show that non-wavefunction vertices are supplanted by contributions from\nhigher Fock states in light-front time-ordered perturbation theory (provided the interaction\nhas light-cone time dependence). In essence contributions from non-wavefunction vertices\nare reducible and should only be used when the interaction is (or is approximately) instantaneous1 . This constitutes a replacement theorem for non-wavefunction vertices which\ntrivially extends to (3+1) dimensions. When one works from covariant perturbation theory,\nthe coupled tower of Dyson-Schwinger equations gives rise to the light-cone Fock components [34, 35]. Thus when the Green's functions are treated properly and the light-front\nBSE is derived, instead of postulated, non-wavefunction contributions are absent.\nThe organization of this Chapter is as follows. First in Section 2.1.1 we present the\nissue of non-wavefunction vertices and energy poles of the Bethe-Salpeter vertex focusing\non a typical light-front constituent quark model as an example. For such models, nonwavefunction vertices are required to express the form factor. We find the commonly used\nassumptions in quark models necessitate vertices not only without energy poles but without\nenergy dependence. Hence covariance is generally lost. Next in Section 2.1.2, we review the\nreduction of the Bethe-Salpeter equation presented in [16] focusing on the energy poles of\nthe vertex. We derive an interpretation of the reduction as a procedure for approximating\nthe poles of the vertex. Additionally in Section 2.2, we show how the normalization of the\ncovariant Bethe-Salpeter equation turns into a familiar many-body normalization in the\nlight-front reduction. The normalization condition resembles a diagonal matrix element of\na pseudo current and has contributions from higher Fock states. We calculate the explicit\nnormalization condition for the ladder model at next-to-leading order in perturbation theory.\nThe connection to the familiar many-body Fock state normalization is made in Appendix\nE. In the following Section (2.3), we construct the current to be used with the reduced\nformalism. In Section 2.4 the (1 + 1)-dimensional ladder model is presented and in Section\n2.4.2 we compare the calculation of the form factor for the model using two different paths\nto the reduction. The comparison allows us to see when non-wavefunction vertices can be\nefficiently used. Lastly we summarize our findings in Section 2.5.\n\n2.1\n\nLight-front reduction\n\nTo derive a bound state equation on the light front, we must investigate the reduction of the\ncovariant BSE Eq. (1.29) to the hypersurface x+ = 0. Following the toy wavefunction example presented in Section 1.2.2, we must integrate over the light-cone energy to obtain the\nproper three-dimensional boundary value. The clear first step to handling such a reduction\napproximately is to make simplifying assumptions about the dependence on the light-cone\nenergy to enable the projection. Near independence from light-front energy corresponds to\nan instantaneous approximation with respect to light-front time. This is where we begin\nour discussion.\n1\nWe shall often refer to interactions and vertices merely as instantaneous if they are independent of\nlight-cone time, or equivalently light-cone energy. Similarly we are not careful about referring to light-cone\ntime and light-cone energy as time and energy, respectively.\n\n15\n\n\f2.1.1\n\nPoles of the Bethe-Salpeter vertex\n\nTo introduce the reader to non-wavefunction vertices and instantaneous approximations,\nwe focus on light-front constituent quark models. We start by writing down the covariant\nequation for the meson2 vertex function \u0393. In (1 + 1) dimensions, it satisfies a simple BSE\n(see Figure 1.4):\nZ\nd2 p\nV (k, p)\u03a8BS (p, R),\n(2.1)\n\u0393(k, R) = i\n(2\u03c0)2\nin which we have defined the Bethe-Salpeter wavefunction \u03a8BS as\n\u03a8BS (k, R) = G(k, R)\u0393(k, R),\n\n(2.2)\n\nwith the two-particle disconnected propagator G(k, R) = d(k)d(R \u2212 k). For scalars of mass\nm, the renormalized, single-particle propagator d has a Klein-Gordon form\nd(k) =\n\ni\n(k2\n\n\u2212\n\nm2 )[1\n\n+\n\n(k2\n\n\u2212 m2 )f (k2 )] + i\u01eb\n\n,\n\n(2.3)\n\nwhere the residue is i at the physical mass pole and the function f (k 2 ) characterizes the\nrenormalized, one-particle irreducible self-interactions. To simplify the comparison carried\nout in Section 2.4, we shall ignore f (k2 ). Above V is the irreducible two-to-two scattering\nkernel which we shall refer to inelegantly as the interaction potential.\nNow we imagine the initial conditions of our system are specified on the hypersurface\nx+ = 0. As we saw for DIS, correlations between field operators evaluated at equal lightcone time turn up in hard processes for which this choice of initial surface is natural. In\norder to project out the initial conditions (wavefunctions, etc.) of our system, we must\nperform the integration over the Fourier conjugate to x+ , namely k\u2212 . For instance, our\nconcern is with the light-front wavefunction \u03c8(x) defined as the projection of the covariant\nBethe-Salpeter wavefunction onto x+ = 0,\nZ\ndk\u2212\n+\n\u03a8BS (k, R),\n(2.4)\n\u03c8(x) = 2R x(1 \u2212 x)\n2\u03c0\nwith x = k+ /R+ . The overall multiplicative factor in the definition of \u03c8(x) is an arbitrary\nchoice.\nLooking at Eq. (2.2), in order to project the wavefunction exactly, we must know the\nanalytic structure of the bound-state vertex function. If the vertex function \u0393(k, R) had\nno poles in k\u2212 , then our task would be simple: the light-front projection of \u03a8BS would\npick up contributions only from the poles of the propagator G(k, R). Next we observe\nfrom Eq. (2.1), that the k\u2212 dependence of the interaction V (k, p) must give rise to the k\u2212\npoles of the vertex function \u0393(k, R). Hence an instantaneous interaction gives rise to an\ninstantaneous vertex and a simple light-front projection (see, e.g., [29]).\nOn the other hand, constituent quark models often assume a less restrictive simplification of the analytic structure of the vertex (see, e.g., [32]) in order to permit the light-cone\nprojection. We shall show that this assumption along with the presumed covariance of\nthe quark model implies instantaneous vertices. For any momentum p, let us denote the\n2\n+\n(1 + 1)-dimensional on-shell energy p\u2212\non = m /2p . The propagator G(k, R) has two poles\n(\n\u2212 \u2212 i\u01eb\nka\u2212 = kon\nx\n(2.5)\ni\u01eb\nkb\u2212 = R\u2212 + (k \u2212 R)\u2212\non \u2212 x\u22121 .\n\n2\nHere we use meson to denote a general two-particle bound state. Mesons just happen to be convenient\nexamples.\n\n16\n\n\f\u0001\n\u0001\n\nk\n\n(a)\n\nk+\u0001\n\n()\n\nk P\n\nP\n\n(b)\n\nP\n\n0\n\nFigure 2.1: Covariant diagram for the electromagnetic form factor. Labels a, b and c denote\nsubscripts used for on-shell energy poles.\n\nNotice that although we work in (1 + 1) dimensions, the results are trivial to extend to\n(3 + 1) dimensions because the imaginary parts of poles have precisely the same dependence\non (only) the plus-momenta. This remark applies not only to this Section but to the rest\nof this Chapter.\nIn constituent quark models that attempt to find a field theoretic basis, \u0393 is assumed to\nhave no poles in the upper-half k\u2212 -plane for 0 < x < 1. Since the light-front wavefunction\nis proportional to \u03b8[x(1 \u2212 x)], in light of Eq. (2.5) we further require any possible poles of\n\u0393 to lie in the upper-half plane for x < 0 and in the lower-half plane for x > 1. With these\nrestrictions Eq. (2.4) dictates the form of the constituent quark wavefunction\n\u03c8(x) = DW (x|M 2 )\u0393(kb , R)\u03b8[x(1 \u2212 x)],\n\n(2.6)\n\nwhere we have defined the Weinberg propagator as\nDW (x|M 2 ) =\n\n1\nM2 \u2212\n\nm2\nx(1\u2212x)\n\n(2.7)\n\nand used the abbreviation \u0393(kb , R) to denote evaluation at the energy pole k\u2212 = kb\u2212 appearing in Eq. (2.5).\nWhen we calculate the (elastic) electromagnetic form factor for these constituent quark\nmodels (see Figure 2.1), we are confronted with more poles. Let \u2206+ = \u2212\u03b6P + < 0 be the\nplus-component of the momentum transfer between initial and final state mesons. The form\nfactor is then\nZ\n(2x \u2212 \u03b6)\u0393(k, P )\u0393\u2217 (k + \u2206, P + \u2206) d2 k\n(2.8)\nF (t) \u221d\n[k2 \u2212 m2 ][(P \u2212 k)2 \u2212 m2 ][(k + \u2206)2 \u2212 m2 ]\n\nThe k\u2212 -poles from the propagators are ka\u2212 , kb\u2212 defined in (2.5) and kc\u2212 = \u2212\u2206\u2212 + (k + \u2206)\u2212\non \u2212\ni\u01eb\nx\u2212\u03b6 .\nGiven this pole structure, the contributions to F (t) are proportional to \u03b8[x(1 \u2212 x)]. In\nthe region x < \u03b6, closing the contour in the upper-(lower-) half plane will enclose possible\npoles of the final (initial) vertex. As one can see from considering the region x > \u03b6, the\nform factor can be determined solely from Res(kb\u2212 ). In (3 + 1) dimensions, where we are\nfree to choose frames in which \u03b6 = 0, this becomes the only contribution to the form factor.\nBut if \u03b6 6= 0, the additional poles from vertices in the region x < \u03b6 are required by Lorentz\ninvariance.\nIf one advocates no modification to the pole structure of Eq. (2.8) due to the vertices,\nthen by closing the contour in the lower-half plane, one picks up the residue at ka\u2212 without\n17\n\n\fany contribution from poles of the initial-state vertex. Such poles cannot lie in the upperhalf plane for x < \u03b6 since the form of \u03c8 would be both frame dependent and contrary to that\nof Eq. (2.6) [the (3 + 1)-dimensional version of which is employed by all light-front quark\nmodels]. Thus one is actually assuming there are no poles of the Bethe-Salpeter vertex,\nwhich we originally pointed out in [30].\nReturning to the definition of the wavefunction (2.4) under the premise of a vertex\ndevoid of poles, we now find \u0393(kb , P ) = \u0393(ka , P ), which we shall call pole symmetry. This\nsymmetry is essential for making contact with the Drell-Yan formula [36], since for x > \u03b6\nboth initial- and final- state vertices may be expressed in terms of wavefunctions. When\nx < \u03b6, however, the final-state vertex becomes \u0393\u2217 (ka + \u2206, P + \u2206) which cannot be expressed\nin terms of \u03c8 \u2217 (x\u2032 ) (where x\u2032 = x\u2212\u03b6\n1\u2212\u03b6 ) even with pole symmetry. Such a vertex we refer to as a\nnon-wavefunction vertex. Understanding and dealing with such objects from the perspective\nof time-ordered perturbation theory is the primary goal of this Chapter.\nNaturally constituent quark models presume the integral in Eq. (2.8) converges. This\nin turn enables us to relate an initial-state non-wavefunction vertex to the final-state nonwavefunction vertex encountered above via integrating around a circle at infinity. Equating\nthe sum of residues Res(ka\u2212 ) + Res(kb\u2212 ) + Res(kc\u2212 ) = 0, we find\n\u0393(kc , P ) \u2212\n\u0393\u2217 (ka + \u2206, P \u2032 ) \u2212\n(k \u2212 kc\u2212 ) \u2212\n(k \u2212 ka\u2212 ) = ka\u2212 \u2212 kc\u2212 .\n\u0393\u2217 (kb + \u2206, P \u2032 ) b\n\u0393(kb , P ) b\n\n(2.9)\n\nThis relation holds for the class of models for which the pole structure of Eq. (2.8) is not\nmodified by the vertices. The ratio structure of the vertices does not allow for a common\nfactor ka\u2212 \u2212 kc\u2212 in the two terms in Eq. (2.9). The equality then depends on delicate\ncancellations between initial- and final- state vertices, which in general are unrelated.3 The\nphilosophy of constituent quark model phenomenology is to choose the form of \u03c8 and hence\nthe form of \u0393. This rules out any such delicate cancellation. Treating \u0393 as free to be chosen,\nthe equality Eq. (2.9) can only hold if both ratios are one. This yields the restriction\n\u2202\n\u0393(kc , P ) = 0.\n\u2202\u2206\u2212\n\n(2.10)\n\nBut \u2206\u2212 only enters \u0393(kc , P ) through k\u2212 = kc\u2212 . Hence \u0393 is independent of k\u2212 , which is a\nhidden assumption in light-front quark models.4 Clearly this assumption is problematic for\nthe calculation of form factors in frames where \u03b6 6= 0. Furthermore, covariance cannot be\nborne in unless the vertex \u0393(k, R) is completely independent of k\u03bc .\nIn general, of course, the vertex \u0393 not only has light-front energy dependence but poles\nas well. As we shall see below, the light-front reduction of the Bethe-Salpeter equation is\na procedure for approximating the poles of the vertex function. Moreover when applied to\ncurrent matrix elements, which require further contributions from higher Green's functions,\nthese poles generate higher Fock state contributions.\n\n2.1.2\n\nThe reduction scheme\n\nTo reduce the Lippmann-Schwinger equation (or any such Dyson-Schwinger equation) to\na light-front version, we must introduce an auxiliary Green's function G\u0303 in place of G (as\n3\n\nIn particular, one could consider the final state to be an excited state. While the process is not elastic,\nthe analysis goes through unchanged and the initial and final state vertices would not permit the delicate\ncancellations required by Eq. (2.9).\n4\nThere is another way to reveal this hidden assumption. The vertex \u0393 cannot be both covariant and\ndevoid of k\u2212 poles for the integral in Eq. (2.8) to exist.\n\n18\n\n\fin [37]). Thus we have\nT = W + W G\u0303T,\n\n(2.11)\n\nW = V + V (G \u2212 G\u0303)W.\n\n(2.12)\n\nprovided that\nTaking residues of Eq. (2.11) gives us an alternate way to express the bound state vertex\nfunction\n\u0393 = W G\u0303\u0393.\n(2.13)\nTo choose a light front reduction, G\u0303 must inherently be related to projection onto the\nR \u2212 \u2212\ninitial surface x+ = 0. For simplicity, we denote the integration dk\n2\u03c0 hk |O(R) = O(R).\nWith this notation, we will always work in (1 + 1)-dimensional momentum space for which\nthe only sensible matrix elements of O(R) are of the form hk+ | O(R)|p\u2212 , p+ i. The operator\nO(R) is defined similarly. The generalization of both operators to (3 + 1) dimensions\nis obvious. For a useful reduction scheme (one that preserves unitarity), we must have\nG(R) = G\u0303(R) . The simplest choice of G\u0303 that results in time-ordered perturbation\ntheory requires\n(2.14)\nG\u0303(R) = G(R) g\u22121 (R) G(R),\nwhere the reduced disconnected propagator g(R) is defined by the matrix elements\nhxR+ | G(R) |yR+ i = hxR+ |g(R)|yR+ i.\n\n(2.15)\n\nExplicitly this forces\nhxR+ |g(R)|yR+ i = 2\u03c0\u03b4(xR+ \u2212 yR+ )\u03b8[x(1 \u2212 x)]\n\n2\u03c0i\n2R+ x(1\n\n\u2212 x)\n\nDW (x|R2 ).\n\n(2.16)\n\nThe inverse propagator g\u22121 (R) can then be constructed, bearing in mind g \u22121 (R) only exists\nin the subspace where g(R) is non-zero. Explicitly\nhxR+ |g \u22121 (R)|yR+ i = 2\u03c0\u03b4(xR+ \u2212 yR+ )\u03b8[x(1 \u2212 x)]\n\n2R+ x(1 \u2212 x)\nDW \u22121 (x|R2 ).\n2\u03c0i\n\n(2.17)\n\nThis forces\nhxR+ |g\u22121 (R)g(R)|yR+ i = 2\u03c0\u03b4(xR+ \u2212 yR+ )\u03b8[x(1 \u2212 x)],\n\n(2.18)\n\nt(R) = g\u22121 (R) G\u0303(R)T (R)G\u0303(R) g \u22121 (R)\n\n(2.19)\n\nwhich is unity restricted to the subspace where the operators g(R) and g\u22121 (R) are defined. We are more careful about this point than the authors [16] since the consequences\nof Eq. (2.17) are essential for dealing with instantaneous interactions. Notice G\u0303(R) defined\nin Eq. (2.14) is consequently non-zero only for plus-momentum fractions between zero and\none.\nThe reduced transition matrix t(R) is\n\nTaking the residue of Eq. (2.19) at R2 = M 2 , gives a homogeneous equation for the reduced\nvertex function \u03b3\n|\u03b3R i = w(R)g(R)|\u03b3R i,\n(2.20)\n19\n\n\fwhere the reduced auxiliary kernel is\nw(R) = g \u22121 (R) G(R)W (R)G(R) g\u22121 (R).\n\n(2.21)\n\nGiven this structure, the reduced kernel w(x, y|R2 ) \u2261 hxR+ |w(R)|yR+ i will always be\n\u221d \u03b8[x(1 \u2212 x)]\u03b8[y(1 \u2212 y)]. Moreover the reduced vertex \u03b3(x|M 2 ) \u2261 hxR+ |\u03b3R i \u221d \u03b8[x(1 \u2212 x)]\nas a result of Eq. (2.20).\nFrom (2.20) we can define the light-front wavefunction |\u03c8R i \u2261 g(R)|\u03b3R i, notice this\ntoo restricts the momentum fraction x: \u03c8(x) \u221d \u03b8[x(1 \u2212 x)]. By iterating the LippmannSchwinger equation for T twice, it is possible to relate T to t and thereby construct T\ngiven t, which is clearly not possible from the definition (2.19). Taking the residue of this\nrelation between T and t yields the reduced-to-covariant conversion between bound-state\nvertex functions, namely\n|\u0393R i = W (R)G(R) |\u03b3R i.\n(2.22)\nFinally, we can manipulate the covariant Bethe-Salpeter amplitude into the form\n!\n\u0010\n\u0011\n|\u03a8R i = 1 + G(R) \u2212 G\u0303(R) W (R) G(R) |\u03b3R i,\n\n(2.23)\n\nwhich justifies the interpretation of |\u03c8R i as the light-front wavefunction since it is easy to\ndemonstrate that |\u03a8R i = |\u03c8R i.\n\nWhile all light-front reduction schemes when summed to all orders yield the x+ = 0\nprojection of the Bethe-Salpeter equation, the choice of G\u0303(R) in Eq. (2.14) generates a\nkernel calculated in light-front time-ordered perturbation theory. The normalization of the\ncovariant and reduced wavefunction will be discussed below.\n\n2.1.3\n\nAn interpretation for the reduction\n\nThe heart of our intuition about the light cone lies in integrating out the minus-momentum\ndependence of the covariant wavefunction. So we merely cast the formal reduction in a way\nwhich highlights the contributions from poles of the covariant vertex function.\nUtilizing Eqs. (2.13) and (2.22), we can show\nG\u0303(R)|\u0393R i = G(R) |\u03b3R i.\n\n(2.24)\n\nThus the appearance of G\u0303(R)|\u0393R i has the form of an instantaneous approximation since\nEq. (2.24) shows that it has no minus-momentum poles besides those of the propagator\nG(R).\nThis instantaneous approximation appears in determining the light-front wavefunction.\nUsing Eqs. (2.12) and (2.23), we have\n|\u03c8R i = G(R)V (R)\n\n\u221e h\u0010\n\u0011\nij\nX\nG(R) \u2212 G\u0303(R) V (R) G(R) |\u03b3R i.\n\n(2.25)\n\nj=0\n\nFrom truncating the series in G(R) \u2212 G\u0303(R) at some j = n \u2212 1 and using a consistent\napproximation to Eq. (2.22), we are led to the nth -order approximate solution \u03c8 (n)\n|\u03c8 (n) i = (GV )n G\u0303|\u0393i,\n20\n\n(2.26)\n\n\fafter having used Eq. (2.24). Thus at any order n in the formal reduction scheme, we\nhave iterated the covariant Bethe-Salpeter equation n-times and subsequently made an\ninstantaneous approximation via Eq. (2.24). Retaining the minus-momentum dependence\nin V to nth order allows for an nth -order approximation to the vertex function's poles.\n\n2.2\n\nNormalization\n\nThe relation Eq. (2.23) between the four-dimensional Bethe-Salpeter wavefunction and the\nreduced light-front wavefunction was presented in [16]. The normalization of the reduced\nwavefunction, however, was not discussed in much detail and we address this below following\nour work in [38].\nThe reducible four-point function defined by G(4) = G + GT G has the behavior\nG(4) (R) = \u2212i\n\n|\u03a8R ih\u03a8R |\n+ finite,\n\u2212 M 2 + i\u01eb\n\n(2.27)\n\nR2\n\nnear the bound state pole. Since the four-point function satisfies the equation\n\u0010\n\u0011\nG(4) (R) = G(4) (R) G\u22121 (R) \u2212 V (R) G(4) (R),\n\n(2.28)\n\nthe Bethe-Salpeter amplitude must satisfy\n1=\n\nlim \u2212i\n\nR2 \u2192M 2\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\nh\u03a8R | G\u22121 (R) \u2212 V (R) |\u03a8R i\nR2 \u2212 M 2\n\n,\n\n(2.29)\n\nwhich is necessarily finite since |\u03a8R i satisfies the bound state equation: |\u03a8R i = GV |\u03a8R i.\nApplication of l'H\u00f4pital yields the covariant normalization condition [39]\n2iR\u03bc = h\u03a8R |\n\n\u0011\n\u2202 \u0010 \u22121\nG (R) \u2212 V (R) |\u03a8R i\n\u2202R\u03bc\n\n.\n\n(2.30)\n\nR2 \u2212M 2\n\nThe normalization (2.30) takes the form of a diagonal matrix element of a pseudo current.\nIn what follows we shall omit total four-momentum labels since they are all identically R. As we saw above, the light-front reduction is performed by integrating out the\nminus-momentum dependence with the help of an auxiliary Green's function G\u0303(R). The\nnormalization condition for the reduced wavefunction is then deduced by using the conversion Eq. (2.23) and the definition of the reduced wavefunction |\u03c8R i, namely\n|\u03c8R i = |\u03a8R i = g(R)|\u03b3R i.\nHence taking the plus component of Eq. (2.30), we arrive at\n!\n!\n!\nh\ni\n\u2202\nG\u22121 \u2212 V\n1 + (G \u2212 G\u0303)W G |\u03b3R i.\n2iR+ = h\u03b3R | G 1 + W (G \u2212 G\u0303)\n\u2202R\u2212\n\n(2.31)\n\n(2.32)\n\nThe complicated normalization condition is indicative of the effects of higher Fock space\ncomponents.\n\n21\n\n\fTo see this explicitly, we must know the minus-momentum dependence of the interaction.\nWe therefore adopt a weakly coupled, one-boson exchange model for V (the so-called ladder\napproximation). Supposing the boson mass is \u03bc and the coupling constant g, we have\nV (k, p) =\n\n\u2212g2\n.\n(p \u2212 k)2 \u2212 \u03bc2 + i\u01eb\n\n(2.33)\n\nIn considering the normalization condition, we will work in (3 + 1) dimensions. The bound\nstate equation and wavefunctions which result from the leading-order ladder exchanges are\ncollected in Appendix D. Notice \u2202V /\u2202R\u03bc = 0. For our purposes, it suffices to assume we\nhave a light-front wavefunction \u03c8(x, k\u22a5 ) for the lowest Fock state and then investigate the\nform of the constraint given in Eq. (2.32).\nLet us start with the contribution at leading order in G\u2212 G\u0303 to the reduced wavefunction's\nnormalization.\n\u0011\n\u0010 \u2202\n\u2212i\n\u22121\nG |\u03b3R i = 1.\n(2.34)\nh\u03b3R | G\nG\n2R+\n\u2202R\u2212\nTo perform the integration, we note\n\u2202\nG\u22121 (k, R) = \u22122iR+ d\u22121 (k)(1 \u2212 x),\n\u2202R\u2212\n\n(2.35)\n\nwhere we have customarily chosen x = k+ /R+ .

(2.39)\n\u2212i\n(2\u03c0)4 (2\u03c0)4\nThe minus-momentum integrals above are similar to those considered in deriving the boundstate equation to leading order in Appendix D. The only difference is the double pole due\nto the extra propagator d(R \u2212 k). With x = k+ /R+ and y = p+ /R+ , for x > y we avoid\npicking up the residue at the double pole and the result is the same as in Eq. (2.34) after\nusing the bound-state equation. This term is then subtracted by the G\u0303 term in equation\n(2.38). On the other hand, when x < y we pick up the residue at the double pole. Part\nof the residue is subtracted by the G\u0303 term; the other half depends on \u2202V (k, p)/\u2202k \u2212 .

By construction, \u0393\u03bc is gauge invariant.\nsecond term in Eq. (2.38) is evaluated identically up to {k \u2194 p}. Now combining the two\nterms and their relevant \u03b8 functions, we can rewrite the result using the explicit form of the\nlight-front time-ordered one-boson-exchange potential Eq. D.3, namely\n!\nZ\ndydp\u22a5\ndxdk\u22a5\n\u2202\n\u2217\n\u22a5\n\u22a5\n\u22a5\n2\n\u03c8 (x, k ) \u2212\nV (x, k ; y, p |M ) \u03c8(y, p\u22a5 ).\n\u03b4N =\n2(2\u03c0)3 x(1 \u2212 x) 2(2\u03c0)3 y(1 \u2212 y)\n\u2202M 2\n(2.40)\nThus although the covariant derivative's action on the potential vanishes, we can manipulate\nthe correction to the normalization into the form of a derivative's action on the light-front\nkernel. With this form, we can compare to the familiar\nnonvalence\n\u221a\n\u221a probability discussed in\n+\n\u2212\nAppendix E [in the frame where R = R = M/ 2, with M/ 2 as the eigenvalue of the\nlight-front Hamiltonian, denoted p\u2212 in Eq. (E.8)]. This correction to the normalization has\nbeen discussed earlier [3].\nHere we have seen that the normalization of the light-cone wavefunction includes effects\nfrom higher Fock states. Since this normalization condition stemmed from a diagonal matrix element of a pseudo current, we should not be surprised that matrix elements of the\nelectromagnetic current, when treated in this reduction scheme, pick up contributions from\nhigher Fock states. These contributions to current matrix elements are the subject of the\nnext Section.\n\n2.3\n\nCurrent\n\nHere we extend the formalism presented so far to include current matrix elements between\nbound states. We do so in a gauge invariant fashion following [40]. Our notation, however,\nis more in line with the elegant method of gauging equations presented in [41, 42]. This\nlatter general method extends to bound systems of more than two particles. Our goal here is\nto see how higher Fock contributions appear from the covariant starting point and rule out\nthe use of non-wavefunction vertices. Once one accepts the results, one may work directly\nwith the three-dimensional light-front kernel and gauge it. The results are the same [43].\nConsider first the full four-point function G(4) defined by\nG(4) = G + GT G.\n\n(2.41)\n\nFor later use, it is important to note that the residue of G(4) (R) at the bound state pole\nR2 = M 2 is \u2212i|\u03a8R ih\u03a8R |. Using the Lippmann-Schwinger equation for T , we can show the\nfour-point function satisfies\nG(4) = G + GV G(4) .\n(2.42)\nTo discuss electromagnetic current matrix elements, we will need the three-point function for the ith constituent, which we write as d\u03bci . We define an irreducible three-point\n23\n\n\ffunction for the ith constituent \u0393\u03bci in the obvious way\nd\u03bci = di \u0393\u03bci di .\n\n(2.43)\n\nNow we need to relate the one-particle electromagnetic vertex function to the T matrix.\nLet j \u03bc denote the electromagnetic coupling to the constituent particles (since our particles\n\u2194\n\nare scalars j \u03bc = \u2202 \u03bc ). Since the electromagnetic three-point function \u0393\u03bci is irreducible, we\nhave\n\u0393\u03bci = G\u22121 G(4) j \u03bc\n(2.44)\nand by using the definition of G(4) Eq. (2.41), we have the desired relation\n\u0393\u03bci = j \u03bc + T Gj \u03bc\n\n(2.45)\n\nNotice the right hand side lacks the particle label i. In the first term, the bare coupling\nacts on the ith particle while in the second term the bare coupling does not act on the ith\nparticle. For this reason we have dropped the label which will always be clear from context.\nIn considering two propagating particles' interaction with a photon, the above definitions\nlead us to the impulse approximation \u0393\u03bc0 to the current\n\u22121 \u03bc\n\u0393\u03bc0 = \u0393\u03bc1 d\u22121\n2 + d1 \u03932 .\n\n(2.46)\n\nAdditionally the photon could couple to interacting particles. Define a gauged interaction\nV \u03bc topologically by attaching a photon to the kernel in all possible places. This leads us to\nthe irreducible electromagnetic vertex \u0393\u03bc defined as (see Figure 2.2)\n\u0393\u03bc = \u0393\u03bc0 + V \u03bc ,\n\n(2.47)\n\nwhich is gauge invariant by construction.\nLastly to calculate matrix elements of the current between bound states it is useful to\ndefine a reducible five-point function (see Figure 2.3)\nG(5) \u03bc = G(4) \u0393\u03bc G(4) .\n\n(2.48)\n\nHaving laid down the necessary facts about electromagnetic vertex functions and gauge\ninvariant currents, we can now specialize to their matrix elements between bound states by\ntaking appropriate residues of Eq. (2.48). The form factor is then\n\u2212i(P \u2032\u03bc + P \u03bc )F (t) = h\u03a8P \u2032 |\u0393\u03bc (\u2212\u2206)|\u03a8P i,\n\n(2.49)\n\nwhere P \u2032\u03bc = P \u03bc + \u2206\u03bc and t = \u22062 .\n\n2.4\n\nTwo models\n\nIn this Section, we use the formalism thus far developed for two models. The first model\nhas an instantaneous interaction while the second is not instantaneous. Contributions to\nform factors are contrasted and the issue of non-wavefunction contributions is resolved.\n\n24\n\n\f\u0001\u0002\n\n\u0001\u0002\nG\n\n(5)\u0016\n\n\u0016\n\nG\n\nG\n\n(4)\n\n(4)\n\n=\n\nFigure 2.3: Graphical depiction of the reducible five-point function G(5) \u03bc .

(2.33) for which\nthe energy pole (with respect to p) of the interaction V (p, k) is\n\u2212\np\u2212\nv =k +\n\ni\u01eb\n\u03bc2\n\u2212\n.\n+\n+\n+\n2(p \u2212 k ) 2(p \u2212 k+ )\n\n(2.50)\n\nThis interaction is completely non-local in space-time and hence does not have an instantaneous piece. The reduced kernel Eq. (2.21) is consequently made up of retarded terms\n(i.e. dependent on the eigenvalue M 2 ) where higher order in G \u2212 G\u0303 means more particles\npropagating at a given instant of light-cone time (see, e.g., [16]). The leading-order equation\nfor \u03c8 from Eq. (2.20) is the Weinberg equation [44]\nZ 1\nw(x, y|M 2 )\u03c8(y)\n2\ndy.\n(2.51)\n\u03c8(x) = \u2212DW (x|M )\n2(2\u03c0)y(1 \u2212 y)\n0\nwith the time-ordered one-boson exchange potential (see Figure 2.4) calculated to leading\norder from Eq.

(2.51) most simply by iterating the Bethe-Salpeter equation once (see\nSection 2.1.3) and then projecting onto the light cone. See Appendix D for the (3 + 1)dimensional derivation.\nIn the limit \u03bc2 \u226b m2 , M 2 , the interaction becomes approximately instantaneous, which\nsuggests we separate out an instantaneous piece Vo :\nD \u22121 (x, y|M 2 ) = M 2 \u2212\n\nV (k, p) = Vo + [V (k, p) \u2212 Vo ],\n25\n\n(2.54)\n\n\fwhere\n\n\u2212g2 \u03b8(x \u2212 y)\n\u2212g2 \u03b8(y \u2212 x)\n+\n,\n(2.55)\nE 2 (x \u2212 y) \u2212 \u03bc2 E 2 (y \u2212 x) \u2212 \u03bc2\nwith E as a constant parameter to be chosen. Of course other choices of Vo are possible.\nWe choose the above form of Vo for two reasons.\nFirst is the form of the instantaneous approximation wavefunction, which we denote by\n\u03c6(x). When we write the potential as Eq. (2.54), we expand Eq. (2.12) to first order in g 2\nas\n\u0010\n\u0011\nW = Vo + (V \u2212 Vo ) + (V \u2212 Vo ) G \u2212 G\u0303 (V \u2212 Vo ).\n(2.56)\nVo = Vo (x, y) =\n\nTo zeroth order in G \u2212 G\u0303 and V \u2212 Vo , the integral equation for \u03c6 is\nZ 1\nwo (x, y)\u03c6(y)\n2\ndy,\n\u03c6(x) = \u2212DW (x|M )\n0 2(2\u03c0)y(1 \u2212 y)\n\n(2.57)\n\nwhere by Eq. (2.21), the reduced instantaneous potential is merely wo (x, y) = \u03b8[x(1 \u2212\nx)]\u03b8[y(1 \u2212 y)]Vo (x, y). In the instantaneous limit, \u03bc2 \u226b m2 , M 2 solutions to Eqs. (2.51) and\n(2.57) coincide-both wavefunctions approach \u223c DW (x, 4m2 ).\nSecondly, we preserve the contact interaction limit by excluding from Vo the factor\n\u03b8[x(1 \u2212 x)]\u03b8[y(1 \u2212 y)]. That is, when {\u03bc2 , g2 } \u2192 \u221e with g2 /\u03bc2 fixed (or equivalently\nE \u2192 0) we have the contact interaction5 Vo \u2192 g 2 /\u03bc2 , which rightly knows nothing about\nthe momentum fractions x and y. We shall now investigate contributions to the form factors\nfor each of the models Eqs. (2.33) and (2.55).\n\n2.4.2\n\nForm factors\n\nFrom Eq. (2.49) we can calculate the form factors for each of the models (2.33) and (2.55)\nin the reduced formalism. Working in perturbation theory, we separate out contributions\nup to first order by using Eq. (2.23) to first order in G \u2212 G\u0303 and \u0393\u03bc (2.47) in the first Born\napproximation. The matrix element J \u03bc = h\u03a8P \u2032 |\u0393\u03bc (\u2212\u2206)|\u03a8P i then appears for a model with\nsome kernel V\n\u0010\n\u0011\nJ \u03bc \u2248 h\u03b3P \u2032 | G(P \u2032 ) 1 + V (P \u2032 )(G(P \u2032 ) \u2212 G\u0303(P \u2032 ))\n\u0010\u2194\n\u0011\n\u2194\n\u22121\n\u03bc\n\u00d7 \u2202 \u03bc (\u2212\u2206)d\u22121\n+\nV\n(\u2212\u2206)G(\u2212\u2206)\n\u2202\n(\u2212\u2206)d\n2\n2\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u00d7 1 + (G(P ) \u2212 G\u0303(P ))V (P ) G(P ) |\u03b3P i\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u03bc\n(2.58)\n=\nJLO\n+ \u03b4Ji\u03bc + \u03b4Jf\u03bc + \u03b4J\u03b3\u03bc + O[V 2 ],\nwith the leading-order result\n\n\u2194\n\n\u03bc\nJLO\n= h\u03b3P \u2032 | G(P \u2032 ) \u2202 \u03bc (\u2212\u2206)d\u22121\n2 G(P ) |\u03b3P i.\n\n(2.59)\n\nThe first-order terms are\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u2194\n\u03b4Ji\u03bc = h\u03b3P \u2032 | G(P \u2032 ) \u2202 \u03bc (\u2212\u2206)d\u22121\nG(P ) \u2212 G\u0303(P ) V (P )G(P ) |\u03b3P i\n2\n\u0010\n\u0011\u2194\n\u03b4Jf\u03bc = h\u03b3P \u2032 | G(P \u2032 )V (P \u2032 ) G(P \u2032 ) \u2212 G\u0303(P \u2032 ) \u2202 \u03bc (\u2212\u2206)d\u22121\n2 G(P ) |\u03b3P i\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u2194\n\u03b4J\u03b3\u03bc = h\u03b3P \u2032 | G(P \u2032 ) V (\u2212\u2206)G(\u2212\u2206) \u2202 \u03bc (\u2212\u2206) d\u22121\n2 G(P ) |\u03b3P i.\n\n(2.60)\n\n5\nThis exactly soluble (1 + 1)-dimensional light-cone model, in which \u03c8(x) \u221d DW (x|M 2 ), has been considered earlier in [45].\n\n26\n\n\fThe labels indicate the intuition behind the reduction scheme (seen in Section 2.1.3): the\nterm \u03b4Jf\u03bc arises from one iteration of the covariant Bethe-Salpeter equation for the finalstate vertex followed by an instantaneous approximation (2.24), \u03b4Ji\u03bc arises in the same way\nfrom the initial state and \u03b4J\u03b3\u03bc comes from one iteration of the Lippmann-Schwinger equation\n(1.27).\nAt this point, we must specify which component of the current vector we are using to\ncalculate the form factor. In Section 2.3, we started with the manifestly Lorentz invariant\ndecomposition of the current matrix element, cf. Eq. (2.49). Working to first-order in the\nreduction scheme, however, covariance has been lost, e.g., the kernel Eq. (2.52) breaks\nrotational invariance [46]. Thus all components of the current are no longer equivalent. In\norder to make connection with the Drell-Yan formula and the Fock space decomposition\nin [26, 27], we must choose the plus-component of the current. Agreement with the form\nfactor calculated from the minus-component is only achieved when one works to all orders\nin the reduction scheme. Further discussion can be found in [38] and also below in Section\n3.2.\nBecause the leading-order expression (2.59) is independent of the kernel V , the result\nwill have the same form for both models. Using the effective resolution of unity, the above\nexpression converts into\nZ\n\u2194\nd2 p d2 k\n\u22121\n+\n+\n\u2032\n+\n+\n\u2032 |p ihp|G(P ) \u2202 (\u2212\u2206)d\n(2.61)\nh\u03b3\nJLO =\nP\n2 G(P )|ki hk |\u03b3P i.\n(2\u03c0)2 (2\u03c0)2\nBearing in mind the delta function present in G(R), we have the factor\n\u2194\n\nhp| \u2202 + (\u2212\u2206)|ki = \u2212i(2k+ + \u2206+ )(2\u03c0)2 \u03b42 (p \u2212 k \u2212 \u2206).\n\n(2.62)\n\nNow define x = k+ /P + and \u2206+ = \u2212\u03b6P + as above in Section 2.1.1 and denote the reduced\nvertex hk+ |\u03b3R i = \u03b3(x|M 2 ).

For the instantaneous case FLO (t), merely replace \u03c8 with\n\u03c6.\nOn the other hand, we know from Section 2.1.1 the region x < \u03b6 contains a nonwavefunction vertex (see Figure 2.5). However, evaluation of Eq. (2.63) with reduced vertices is quite different than in Section 2.1.1. Rather simply, the term \u03b3 \u2217 (x\u2032 |M 2 ) = 0 by\nvirtue of Eq. (2.20) because x\u2032 < 0. Thus there is no contribution at leading order for\nx < \u03b6.\nThe first-order terms depend explicitly on the interaction and will hence be considerably\ndifferent for each of the models. We consider each model separately.\n\n27\n\n\f\u0001\n\n\u0001\u0002\u0003\n\nFigure 2.5: The Z-graph confronting evaluation of the electromagnetic form factor.\n\nA\n\nB\n\nC\n\nFigure 2.6: Diagrams which contribute to the form factor to first order in G \u2212 G\u0303 for the\nnon-instantaneous case (for x > \u03b6).\n\nNon-instantaneous case\nEvaluating contributions at first order for the non-instantaneous interaction Eq.

Thus there is no contribution to \u03b4Ji+ for x < \u03b6.\nFinally there is the final-state iteration term \u03b4Jf+ in Eq. (2.60). There are only two types\nof contributions. For x > \u03b6, that which can be reduced in to the final-state wavefunction is\nsubtracted by G\u0303. The remaining term is:\nZ\n2\n\u03b8(x \u2212 \u03b6) dxdy \u2032 (2x \u2212 \u03b6) \u2217 \u2032\n+\n\u2032 \u2032\n2 g \u03b8(y \u2212 x)\n\u03c8\n(y\n)D(y\n,\nx\n|M\n)\nD(y, x|M 2 )\u03c8(x), (2.69)\n\u03b4JC =\n16\u03c0 2 x(1 \u2212 x)x\u2032 y \u2032 (1 \u2212 y \u2032 )\ny\u2212x\nwhere y = \u03b6 + (1 \u2212 \u03b6)y \u2032 . This corresponds to diagram C in Figure 2.6. For x < \u03b6, the\nsubtraction term vanishes since x\u2032 < 0 for which G\u0303(P \u2032 ) = 0. The remaining term in \u03b4Jf+\ngives a contribution\nZ\ng2 \u03b8(y \u2212 x)\n\u03b8(\u03b6 \u2212 x) dxdy \u2032 (2x \u2212 \u03b6)/\u03b6\n+\n\u2217 \u2032\n\u2032\u2032\n\u03c8\n(y\n)D\n(x\n|t)\nD(y, x|M 2 )\u03c8(x),\n\u03b4JE =\nW\n16\u03c0 2 (1 \u2212 x)x\u2032\u2032 (1 \u2212 x\u2032\u2032 )y \u2032 (1 \u2212 y \u2032 )\ny\u2212x\n(2.70)\nwhich corresponds to diagram E in Figure 2.7. To summarize, the non-valence correction\nto the form factor in the non-instantaneous case is\ni\n1 h +\n+\n\u03b4FN I =\n(2.71)\n+ \u03b4JE+ ,\n\u03b4JA + \u03b4JB+ + \u03b4JC+ + \u03b4JD\n1 \u2212 \u03b6/2\nand there are no non-wavefunction terms.\nInstantaneous case\nThe case of an instantaneous interaction is quite different due to the absence of light-front\nenergy poles in Vo . Note we are working with Eq. (2.56) to zeroth order in G \u2212 G\u0303 and\nV \u2212 Vo . The first term in Eq. (2.60) we consider is the Born term \u03b4J\u03b3+ . The pole structure\nleads only to a contribution for x < \u03b6:\nZ\n\u03b8(\u03b6 \u2212 x)\u03b8(y \u2212 x) dxdy (2x \u2212 \u03b6)/\u03b6 \u2217 \u2032\n\u03b4J1+ = \u2212\n\u03c6 (y )DW (x\u2032\u2032 |t)Vo (x\u2032\u2032 , y \u2032\u2032 )\u03c6(y),\n(2.72)\n16\u03c0 2 y(1 \u2212 y)y \u2032 x\u2032\u2032 (1 \u2212 x\u2032\u2032 )\nand is depicted by the first diagram in Figure 2.8. The interaction along the way to the\nphoton vertex is crossed and represents pair production off the quark line (x\u2032\u2032 > 1).\n\n29\n\n\f\u0001\u0002\n\nFigure 2.8: Diagrams with crossed interactions necessary to calculate the form factor in the\nregion x < \u03b6 for the instantaneous case.\n\nThe next term \u03b4Ji+ simplifies considerably due to the absence of light-cone time dependence in Vo . As above,\nthe final \u0011\nstate vertex restricts \u03b6 < x < 1. But then we are confronted\n\u0010\nwith a factor hk| G(P ) \u2212 G\u0303(P ) = 0 since x > 0. Thus \u03b4Ji+ = 0.\nThe last term we must consider is \u03b4Jf+ , in which we have an analogous factor for the\n\u0010\n\u0011\nfinal state G(P \u2032 ) \u2212 G\u0303(P \u2032 ) |k + \u2206i. This is zero for x \u2212 \u03b6 > 0, else G\u0303(P \u2032 ) = 0 by virtue\nof Eq. (2.14) and Eq. (2.17). Thus we only have a contribution for x < \u03b6 which is from\nG(P \u2032 )|k + \u2206i. The expression for this contribution is\n\u03b4J2+\n\n=\u2212\n\nZ\n\n\u03b8(\u03b6 \u2212 x)\u03b8(y \u2212 x)dxdy \u2032 (2x \u2212 \u03b6)/\u03b6 \u2217 \u2032\n\u03c6 (y )Vo (y \u2032 , x\u2032 )DW (x\u2032\u2032 |t)\u03c6(x),\n16\u03c0 2 (1 \u2212 x)x\u2032\u2032 (1 \u2212 x\u2032\u2032 )y \u2032 (1 \u2212 y \u2032 )\n\n(2.73)\n\nand is depicted on the right in Figure 2.8. The interaction again is crossed (x\u2032 < 0) and\nrepresents pair production. With Eqs. (2.72) and (2.73), we have both bare-coupling pieces\nof the full Born series for the photon vertex (further terms in the series, which result from\nhigher-order terms in the expansion of W , add interaction blocks to each diagram on the\nquark-antiquark pair's path to annihilation). In this way we recover the full four-point\nGreen's function from summing the Born series [29, 30]. Notice also the above form of\n\u03b4J2+ is what one would obtain from extending the definition of \u03b3 as a non-wave function\nvertex [29]. For the case of an instantaneous interaction, the light-front Bethe-Salpeter\nformalism automatically incorporates crossing.\nTo summarize: we have found the non-valence contribution to the instantaneous model's\nform factor, namely\n\u03b4FI = (\u03b4J1+ + \u03b4J2+ )/(1 \u2212 \u03b6/2).\n(2.74)\nThis expression involves crossed interactions or equivalently terms which could be called\nnon-wavefunction contributions.\nComparison\nNow we compare the form factors for the cases of instantaneous and non-instantaneous\ninteractions. In the instantaneous limit \u03bc2 \u226b m2 , M 2 , however, we understand the behavior of both wavefunctions. The wavefunctions Eq. (2.51) and Eq. (2.57) both become\nnarrowly peaked about x = 1/2 in the large \u03bc2 limit, cf the behavior of DW (x, 4m2 ). Since\nwe are investigating non-valence contributions to form factors, we choose additionally to\nsolve for the instantaneous wavefunction to first order in V \u2212 Vo (see Eq. 2.56) to put the\nwavefunctions on equal footing: i.e. \u03c6(x) \u2248 \u03c8(x), because the difference V \u2212 Vo is presumed\nsmall. This has the efficacious consequence of producing identical leading-order terms, cf\n30\n\n\fTable 2.1: Numerical solution of the bound-state equation Eq. (2.51) for various values of\n\u03bc2 . The coupling constant \u03b1 = 0.100.\n\u03bc2 /m2\n0.100\n0.316\n1.00\n3.16\n10.0\n31.6\n\n4 \u2212 M 2 /m2\n6.57 \u00d7 10\u22121\n2.72 \u00d7 10\u22121\n6.34 \u00d7 10\u22122\n8.79 \u00d7 10\u22123\n9.57 \u00d7 10\u22124\n4.81 \u00d7 10\u22125\n\nEq. (2.64), and eliminates the issue of normalization. Furthermore, the optimal choice of\nthe instantaneous interaction is not under investigation here. So we shall simplify the issue\nby choosing E = 0 in Eq. (2.55).\nFor a few values of \u03bc2 , we solve for the wavefunction using Eq. (2.51). In Table 2.1, we\nlist the values of \u03bc2 used as well as the corresponding eigenvalue M 2 (all for the coupling\nconstant \u03b1 = 0.100, where \u03b1 = g 2 /4\u03c0m4 ). We then calculate the form factors in the\ninstantaneous and non-instantaneous cases. We arbitrarily choose \u03b6 = 0.707. In (1 + 1)\ndimensions, this fixes \u22062 = \u2212\u03b6 2 M 2 /(1 \u2212 \u03b6). The ratio of these form factors-defined using\nEqs. (2.64), (2.71), and (2.74), namely\n(FLO + \u03b4FI )/(FLO + \u03b4FN I )\n\n(2.75)\n\n-is plotted versus log10 (\u03bc2 /m2 ) in Figure 2.9. The Figure indicates the form factors are the\nsame in the large \u03bc2 limit. Since the leading-order contributions are identical, the Figure\nadditionally shows the ratio of non-valence contributions to the form factor, namely\n\u03b4FI /\u03b4FN I .\n\n(2.76)\n\nThis ratio too tends to one as \u03bc2 becomes large, of course not as rapidly. Thus for finite \u03bc2 ,\nwe must add the correction V \u2212 Vo in Eq. (2.56) which results in higher Fock contributions\npresent in the non-instantaneous case.\nLastly we remark that all of this is analytically clear: having eliminated different \u03bc2\ndependence hidden in \u03c8 and \u03c6, expressions for form factors in the instantaneous and noninstantaneous cases are identical to leading order in 1/\u03bc2 , i.e. \u03b4JA+ , \u03b4JB+ , \u03b4JC+ \u223c 1/\u03bc4 while\n+\n, \u03b4JE+ match up with \u03b4J1+ and \u03b4J2+ , respectively,\nthe remaining non-valence contributions \u03b4JD\n2\nto 1/\u03bc .\nOf course, we have demonstrated the replacement of non-wavefunction vertices only to\nfirst order in perturbation theory. Schematically, we have required\n|V \u2212 Vo | \u226a |V (G \u2212 G\u0303)V |.\n\n(2.77)\n\nThis is merely the condition that corrections to Vo from finite \u03bc2 are larger than secondorder corrections from the reduction scheme in Eq. (2.56). Quantitatively this condition\ntranslates to m/4\u03c0\u03bc \u226a \u03b1. If this condition is met, the leading corrections are all of the\nform V \u2212 Vo and the instantaneous model becomes the ladder model (and non-wavefunction\nvertices disappear when calculating the form factor). When the condition is not met, but\n31\n\n\f5\n\nLO + NV\nNV\n\nRatio\n\n4\n3\n2\n1\n-1\n\n-0.5\n\n0\n\n2 0.52\n\nlog10 \u03bc /m\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\nFigure 2.9: Comparison of form factors in instantaneous and non-instantaneous cases. The\nratio Eq. (2.75) of form factors (LO + NV) is plotted versus log10 (\u03bc2 /m2 ) at fixed \u03b6 = 0.707.\nAdditionally the ratio Eq. (2.76) of non-valence contributions to the form factor (NV) is\nplotted. For \u03bc2 \u226b m2 , M 2 , the non-instantaneous contributions becomes approximately\ninstantaneous.\n\nholds to [V (G \u2212 G\u0303)]2 V , say, we must work up to second order in the reduction scheme and\nuse the second Born approximation. We do not pursue this lengthy endeavor here, since for\nthe non-instantaneous case \u03b3(x|M 2 ) \u221d \u03b8[x(1 \u2212 x)] necessarily excludes non-wavefunction\ncontributions in time-ordered perturbation theory. In fact at any order in time-ordered\nperturbation theory we expect to find a complete expression for the form factor in terms of\nFock component overlaps devoid of non-wavefunction vertices, crossed interactions, etc. We\nshall make this correspondence explicit when considering the application of the light-front\nBSE to GPDs in Chapter 3.\n\n2.5\n\nSummary\n\nAbove we investigate current matrix elements in the light-front Bethe-Salpeter formalism.\nFirst we present the issue of non-wavefunction vertices by taking up the common assumptions of light-front constituent quark models. By calculating the form factor in frames\nwhere \u03b6 6= 0, Lorentz invariance mandates contributions from the vertex function's poles.\nQuark models which neglect these residues and postulate a form for the wavefunction are\nassuming not only a pole-free vertex, but a vertex independent of light-front energy. These\nassumptions are very restrictive.\nThis leads us formally to investigate instantaneous and non-instantaneous contributions\nto wavefunctions and form factors necessitating the reduction formalism Eq. (2.23). We\nprovide an intuitive interpretation for the light-front reduction, namely it is a procedure for\napproximating the poles of the Bethe-Salpeter vertex function. This procedure consists of\ncovariant iterations followed by an instantaneous approximation, cf Eq. (2.26), where the\nauxiliary Green's function G\u0303 enables the instantaneous approximation, see Eq. (2.24). In\norder to calculate form factors in the reduction formalism, we construct the gauge invariant\ncurrent Eq. (2.47). As results in the reduction scheme are only covariant when summed to\nall orders, our expressions violate Lorentz symmetry. To extract the form factor we use the\nplus-component of the current in order to make contact with the Drell-Yan formula and the\n\n32\n\n\fFock space representation.\nUsing the ladder model (2.33) and an instantaneous approximation (2.55) we compare\nthe calculation of wavefunctions and form factors in the light-front reduction scheme. Calculation of form factors is dissimilar for the two cases. In the ladder model, which is\nnot instantaneous, non-wavefunction vertices are excluded in time-ordered perturbation\ntheory. For the instantaneous model, however, contribution from crossed interactions is\nrequired. Moreover, these instantaneous contributions derived are identical in form to nonwavefunction vertices used in constituent quark models. As a crucial check on our results,\nwe take the limit \u03bc2 \u226b m2 , M 2 for which the ladder model becomes approximately instantaneous. In this limit, calculation of the form factors for the two models is identical.\nThe net result is an explicit proof, for (1+1) dimensions, that non-wavefunction vertices\nare replaced by contributions form higher Fock states if the interactions between particles are\nnot instantaneous. We call this a replacement theorem [47]. The analysis relies on general\nfeatures of the pole structure of the Bethe-Salpeter equation in light-front time-ordered\nperturbation theory. Therefore it is trivial to extend the theorem to (3 + 1) dimensions.\nWhen one properly considers the entire coupled tower of Dyson-Schwinger equations, the\nlight-front reduction produces light-front versions in light-cone time-ordered perturbation\ntheory [34, 35]. We will make this connection in our approximation of neglecting the self\nenergy when we apply the light-front BSE and its reduction scheme to GPDs in Chapter 3.\n\n33\n\n\fChapter 3\n\nGeneralized Parton Distributions\nThe light-front BSE development and resolution of the non-wavefunction controversy discussed above have natural applications. In Chapter 2, we worked through matrix elements\nof the electromagnetic current in a frame where \u2206+ 6= 0; we can now make the connection\nto generalized parton distributions (GPDs). These distributions, which in some sense are\nthe natural interpolating functions between form factors and quark distribution functions,\nturn up in a variety of hard exclusive processes, e.g., deeply virtual Compton scattering\n(DVCS) and hard electro-production of mesons [48\u201352]. There are a number of insightful\nreview articles on this subject from a variety of perspectives [12, 53\u201356]. The scattering\namplitude for these processes factorizes into a convolution of a hard part (calculable from\nperturbative QCD) and a soft part which the GPDs encode. We will use DVCS to motivate\nthe introduction of GPDs. Since light-cone correlations are probed in these hard processes,\nthe soft physics has a simple interpretation and expression in terms of light-front wavefunctions of the initial and final states [26,27]. After analyzing DVCS, we will see this explicitly\nfor the Wick-Cutkosky model.\nBelow, we take the light-front BSE model of Chapter 2 into (3+ 1) dimensions and make\nclear the connection to higher Fock components by explicitly constructing the three-body\nwavefunction from our expressions for form factors. The immediate application of our development for form factors (in a frame where the plus-component of the momentum transfer\nis non-zero) is to compute GPDs. Connection is made to the Fock space representation and\ncontinuity of the distributions is put under scrutiny. We show how continuity is ensured by\nlight-cone time-ordered perturbation theory for the Wick-Cutkosky model. The light-front\nBethe-Salpeter formalism can also be employed to obtain time-like form factors. This latter\napplication is interesting since no Fock space expansion in terms of bound states is possible.\nIn the interest of organization, a summary of our investigation in [38] for timelike processes.\nappears in Appendix F.\nThe Chapter is organized as follows. First we review the basics of GPDs in Section 3.1,\nincluding the field theoretic properties they must obey. The introduction of GPDs is framed\nin the context of DVCS. This discussion of DVCS is the natural extension of our review of\ndeep-inelastic scattering in Section 1.1. Next in Section 3.2, we use the light-front reduction\nscheme to calculate generalized parton distributions in the Wick-Cutkosky model. We do so\nby using the integrand of the electromagnetic form factor calculated in an arbitrary frame\n[these expressions in (3+1) dimensions are collected in Appendix D, where the leading-order\nbound-state equation for the wavefunction also appears]. We discuss the continuity of these\ndistributions in terms of relations between Fock components at vanishing plus momentum.\n\n34\n\n\f\u0001\nk\n\nk\n\n0\n\nq\n\nP\n\nq\n\nP\n\n0\n\n0\n\nFigure 3.1: Diagrammatic depiction of the DVCS process. An electron of momentum k is\nincident on a proton of momentum P . The leading-order electromagnetic process is virtual\nphoton exchange between the electron and proton. As a result, the electron's momentum is\naltered to k\u2032 . The reaction produces an intact proton of momentum P \u2032 and a real photon,\nq \u20322 = 0.\nConnection is also made to the overlap representation of generalized parton distributions.\nConstruction of the higher Fock components directly from light-front perturbation theory\nis reviewed in Appendix E. Further applications of the reduction formalism to timelike\nprocesses are contained in Appendix F. We conclude our study of the light-front BSE with\na brief summary (Section 3.2.3). Finally we discuss limitations in modeling GPDs from a\nfew different perspectives.\n\n3.1\n\nDefinitions and properties\n\nIn this Section we define GPDs in terms of a light-like correlation of hadronic matrix\nelements. In order to motivate this definition, we consider DVCS which is the theoretically\ncleanest process into which the GPDs enter. The discussion of DVCS below builds on\nthat of DIS presented in Section 1.1. In contrast to DIS, DVCS is an exclusive process\nwhere the final states are detected. Despite this difference, DVCS and DIS are quite similar\ntheoretically.\n\n3.1.1\n\nDVCS\n\nIn DVCS off the proton (or other targets), one is interested lepton scattering at high momentum transfer. The basic reaction is (see Figure 3.1)\ne(k) + p(P ) \u2212\u2192 e(k \u2032 ) + p(P \u2032 ) + \u03b3(q \u2032 ).\n\n(3.1)\n\nThus the situation of the reaction is similar to DIS in setup, however, afterward one is\ninterested in measuring not only the final electron, but also recovering an intact proton\n(altered to some momentum P \u2032 ) in addition to a real photon, q \u20322 = 0. Experimentally\nit is easier to deduce the existence of the final state photon by missing mass techniques\nrather than to detect it directly. Furthermore the existence of a plethora of other channels\nrequires high luminosity beams and long run times in order to filter out enough DVCS\nevents exclusively.\nAs in DIS, we label the momentum transfered to the proton as q = k \u2212 k\u2032 . We will again\nwork to leading order in QED, for which the momentum is transfered via a single virtual\nphoton exchange. In the deeply virtual limit, the photon's virtuality becomes arbitrarily\nlarge, q 2 \u2192 \u2212\u221e. The amplitude for this process can be written in terms of the off-diagonal\n35\n\n\fCompton amplitude T \u03bc\u03bd (q, P, \u2206), where \u2206 = P \u2032 \u2212 P is the momentum transfered to the\nfinal state proton. The off-diagonal Compton amplitude is\nZ\nn\no\n\u03bc\u03bd\nT (q, P, \u2206) = d4 y eiq*y hP \u2032 |T J \u03bc (0)J \u03bd (y) |P i,\n(3.2)\n\nand differs from the DIS case only by the final state proton being off the momentum-space\ndiagonal. The overall amplitude A for the DVCS process has the form\nADVCS = \u01eb\u2217\u03bc (q \u2032 )L\u03bd (k, q)T \u03bc\u03bd (q, P, \u2206),\n\n(3.3)\n\nwhere \u01eb\u2217\u03bc (q \u2032 ) is the polarization vector for the final state photon, and L\u03bd (k, q) describes\nthe QED virtual photon exchange off the electron line. Notice q \u2032 = q \u2212 \u2206 by momentum\nconservation. We include the form of the amplitude Eq. (3.3) in order to contrast with\nthe case of DIS, where the amplitude squared was under investigation. Moreover we are\ninterested in the amplitude as a whole, not just the imaginary part.\nOur setup so far has paralleled the case of DIS. We shall thus choose our variables in a\nsimilar fashion. This choice corresponds to the asymmetric frame employed by Radyushkin.\nNearing the end of this section we will also provide expressions in the symmetric frame of Ji.\nIn the rest of this work we will make use of both frames and their correspondingly different\nsets of variables. In the asymmetric frame, we have P\u22a5 = 0, as in Section 1.1; and the\ndecomposition of the initial state's momentum P \u03bc is identical to Eq. (1.4). Let us define\nthe Bjorken variable for DVCS as\n\u03b6=\u2212\n\nq2\n.\n2P * q\n\n(3.4)\n\nFurther let us choose q * n = 0, so that \u2212q 2 = q2\u22a5 gives the photon's virtuality. This fixes\nthe photon momentum to be\nq2\n\u03bc\n(3.5)\nq \u03bc = q\u22a5\n\u2212 n\u03bc .\n2\u03b6\nNow for the t-channel momentum transfer \u2206\u03bc , we have \u22062 = t. Furthermore \u2206 is restricted\nfrom the constraint q \u20322 = 0 from the final photon. Thus we have the decomposition\n\u2206\u03bc = \u2212\u03b6 p\u03bc + \u2206\u03bc\u22a5 +\n\n\u22062\u22a5 \u2212 t \u03bc\nn ,\n\u03b6\n\n(3.6)\n\nwhich holds only as q 2 \u2192 \u2212\u221e. Notice the plus component of the final state photon\nmomentum is q \u2032+ = \u03b6P + .\nAs we know from DIS, in the deeply virtual limit the Compton amplitude is dominated\nby the leading light-cone singularity in the product of currents. Taking this contribution\ngenerates the so-called handbag dominance due to asymptotic freedom, see Figure 3.2. The\nonly differences compared to Section 1.1 are that the final states have altered momenta, the\nfinal photon is real, and we are not just looking at the cuts of the diagrams. There is an\nadditional requirement so that the amplitude maintains a clear separation of scales, namely\nthe stipulation that |t/q 2 | \u226a 1.\nUsing the handbag dominance, we arrive at the leading contribution to the off-diagonal\nCompton amplitude in the deeply virtual limit\n#\n)\n(\"\nZ\ni(/k \u2212 /q + /\u2206)\ni(/k + q/)\nd4 k\n\u03bd\n\u03bd\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03b3 +\u03b3\n\u03b3 M (k, P, \u2206) ,\nTr\n\u03b3\nT (q, P, \u2206) = \u2212i\n(2\u03c0)4\n(k + q)2 + i\u03b5\n(k \u2212 q + \u2206)2 + i\u03b5\n(3.7)\n36\n\n\fq\n\nP\n\nq'\n\nP'\n\nFigure 3.2: Graphical depiction of the handbag mechanism in DVCS.

The leading contribution in Eq. (3.7) can be\nisolated by taking k\u03bc \u2248 (k * n) p\u03bc . Further we shall define X = k * n, i.e., X = k+ /P + .

Additionally similar to DIS, we can interpret \u03bc as the resolution\nscale for the partonic process. For a complete discussion of O(\u03b1s ) corrections to DVCS and beyond, see,\ne.g. [12, 56].\n\n37\n\n\fNext we observe that by taking various traces we can write\nZ\n\u0002\n\u0003\nd\u03bb i\u03bbX \u2032\ne\nhP |\u03c8(0)\u03b3 \u03bc \u03c8(\u03bbn)|P i = 2 F (X, \u03b6, t) p\u03bc + F3 (X, \u03b6, t) \u2206\u03bc\u22a5 + M 2 F4 (X, \u03b6, t) n\u03bc .\n2\u03c0\n(3.13)\nFinally we identify F (X, \u03b6, t) as the leading structure function for DVCS.2 The contributions\nfrom the other structure functions F3 (X, \u03b6, t) and F4 (X, \u03b6, t) are of higher twist (suppressed\nby |\u2206\u22a5 |/Q and M 2 /Q2 , respectively). The GPDs are contained in the function F (X, \u03b6, t).\n\n3.1.2\n\nGPDs\n\nIn the last Section, we reduced the amplitude for DVCS down to one leading contribution\nin the deeply virtual limit. This leading contribution is a convolution of a hard scattering\npart [seen in Eq. (3.9)], and a soft hadronic matrix element F (X, \u03b6, t). The latter contains\nthe GPDs. In this Section, we will inspect the GPDs more closely and we shall also switch\nframes from Radyushkin's asymmetric frame to Ji's symmetric one. The switch to the\nsymmetric frame illuminates further properties of the GPDs.\nUtilizing Eq. (3.13), we can write the leading-twist structure function as\nZ\nd\u03bb i\u03bbX \u2032\n1\ne\nhP |\u03c8(0) /n \u03c8(\u03bbn)|P i.\nF (X, \u03b6, t) =\n(3.14)\n2\n2\u03c0\nFrom this relation we see immediately that the PDFs are contained in the limit \u2206\u03bc \u2192 0,\nnamely F (X, 0, 0) = f1 (X). For the case of the proton (or any other spin- 21 target), we can\ndecompose the matrix element in terms of two independent GPDs H(X, \u03b6, t) and E(X, \u03b6, t),\nviz.\n\u0015\n\u0014\ni\u03c3 \u03bc\u03bd n\u03bc \u2206\u03bd\n\u2032\nE(X, \u03b6, t) u(P ).\n(3.15)\nF (X, \u03b6, t) = u(P ) /n H(X, \u03b6, t) +\n2M\nNotice by virtue of the Gordon identity (see Appendix I), a possible third structure proportional to n * \u2206 is not independent. Furthermore, the reduction relation to PDFs involves\nonly H(X, \u03b6, t), i.e., f1 (X) = H(X, 0, 0) The independent function E(X, \u03b6, t) is simply not\nvisible in DIS because its presence in any amplitude requires momentum transfer.\nThe decomposition of the function F (X, \u03b6, t) into GPDs H(X, \u03b6, t) and E(X, \u03b6, t) in\nEq. (3.15) is reminiscent of the Dirac and Pauli electromagnetic form factors. Moreover,\nin DVCS the proton remains intact which suggests an even deeper connection with the\nproton's elastic form factors. This connection is afforded by the \"sum rule\" that produces\nthe local limit of the bilocal field operators in Eq. (3.14). Notice the effect of integration\nover X in Eq. (3.14) produces the local limit\nZ\ndX i\u03bbX\n\u03c8(0) /n \u03c8(\u03bbn) = \u03b4(\u03bb) \u03c8(0) /n \u03c8(0).\n(3.16)\ne\n2\u03c0\nThus we find the sum rules\nZ\n\nZ\n\ndX H(X, \u03b6, t) = F1 (t)\n\n(3.17)\n\ndX E(X, \u03b6, t) = F2 (t),\n\n(3.18)\n\n2\n\nAs in DIS, beyond leading order in QCD perturbation theory, the bilocal operator in Eq. (3.13) must\nbe renormalized. This renormalization leads to \u03bc2 dependence of the structure functions but does not affect\nthe twist decomposition.\n\n38\n\n\fwhere F1 (t) is the Dirac form factor and F2 (t) is the Pauli form factor. The \u03b6 dependence\ndrops out3 upon integration over all X. This is a manifestation of Lorentz invariance\nbecause in calculating form factors, one can choose a frame in which the momentum transfer\n\u2206+ = \u2212\u03b6P + = 0. For DVCS, however, there is no remaining freedom to use such a frame\nsince the virtual photon's momentum was chosen so that q + = 0. The requirement \u03b6 6= 0\nimplies that DVCS is sensitive to physics otherwise absent from electromagnetic form factors\ndue to Lorentz invariance.\nIn fact, there are more stringent constraints imposed by Lorentz invariance. The nth\nmoment of each GPD with respect to X must be a polynomial in \u03b6 of order n. This\nconstraint is referred to as the \"polynomiality\" property of GPDs. We will devote ample\nspace to the issue of polynomiality and the special case of sum rules in Chapters 4 and 5.\nThere is a further property that the GPDs must satisfy: they are bounded by the\npositivity of the norm on Hilbert space. This condition implies a bound, referred to generally\nas a positivity bound or very imprecisely as just the positivity property of GPDs. Looking\nat the field operators in Eq. (3.14), we see that the definition of F (X, \u03b6, t) is similar to that\nof a mixed density. As such it is constrained by the PDFs. Using the Cauchy-Schwartz\ninequality, one finds the bound\ns\n\u0010 \u0011 \u0010X \u2212 \u03b6 \u0011\n(3.19)\n\u03b8(X \u2212 \u03b6) F (X, \u03b6, t) \u2264 f1 X f1\n1\u2212\u03b6\nthat we shall refer to as positivity.4 The positivity bound is a property that shall haunt us\nthroughout Chapters 4 and 5 and thus we only briefly mention it here.\nAs a final point in our introductory discussion of GPDs, we switch reference frames\nand variables to define GPDs that are more symmetric with respect to the initial and final\nstates. To do so, we define the average momentum between the states as P \u03bc = 21 (P + P \u2032 )\u03bc\nso that the initial momentum P = P \u2212\u2206/2 and the final momentum P \u2032 = P +\u2206/2. Now we\nchoose a frame of reference in which P\u22a5 = 0. This frame is related to the asymmetric frame\nby a boost and so strictly speaking \u2206\u22a5 is different from above. It is then more convenient\nto use a modified Bjorken variable. Recall \u03b6 = \u2212\u2206+ /P + is a measure of the longitudinal\nmomentum transfer relative to the initial proton's momentum. In the symmetric frame, a\nuseful quantity to consider is the amount of longitudinal momentum transfer relative to the\naverage proton momentum. Thus we define the variable \u03be by\n\u03be=\u2212\n3\n\n\u2206+\n\u2206*n\n= \u2212 +.\n2P * n\n2P\n\n(3.20)\n\nThe local limit also produces an operator of zero anomalous dimension and hence the sum rules Eq. (3.17)\nand (3.18) are independent of the renormalization scale \u03bc. Physically the form factors do not depend upon\nthe resolution scale chosen because it is the (transverse) distribution of total charge that is probed.\n4\nThe positivity bound is stable under QCD evolution, i.e. with Eq. (3.19) modified to include \u03bc2 dependence in all three functions. This can be demonstrated by studying the evolution kernels. Alternately\none can use the light-cone wavefunction representation where the Fock components themselves acquire scale\ndependence (because gluon radiation mixes Fock components). Since the positivity bound is manifest in the\nwavefunction representation, writing down \u03bc2 dependence in the light-cone wavefunctions in F (X, \u03b6, t, \u03bc2 ),\none immediately sees\ns\n\u0010\n\u0011 \u0010X \u2212 \u03b6\n\u0011\n2\n\u03b8(X \u2212 \u03b6) F (X, \u03b6, t, \u03bc ) \u2264 f1 X, \u03bc2 f1\n, \u03bc2 .\n1\u2212\u03b6\n\n39\n\n\fThe conversion between \u03b6 and \u03be is\n\u03b6=\n\n2\u03be\n1+\u03be\n\nThe properly symmetric definition for the GPDs appears as\nZ\nd\u03bb i\u03bbx \u2032\n1\ne hP |\u03c8(\u2212\u03bbn/2) /n \u03c8(\u03bbn/2)|P i,\nF (x, \u03be, t) =\n2\n2\u03c0\n\n(3.21)\n\n(3.22)\n\nwhich features the variable x instead of X. The two are related by\nX=\n\nx+\u03be\n,\n1+\u03be\n\n(3.23)\n\nbecause x is measured relative to the average plus momentum. The operator combination\nin Eq. (3.22) is Hermitian and so F (x, \u03be, t) is real. Under the transformation \u2206\u03bc \u2192 \u2212\u2206\u03bc ,\nwe thus have F (x, \u2212\u03be, t) = F (x, \u03be, t) which is commonly referred to as \u03be-symmetry. This\nsymmetry naturally extends to the GPD moments which are hence required to be even\npolynomials in \u03be.\nAs was the case for PDFs, a natural physical picture for the GPDs emerges when we\nuse light-cone quantized fields. This is because the bilocal operator entering into the GPD\ndefinition is an equal light-cone time operator and not an equal time operator. Despite this\nsimilarity to PDFs, there is not a general probabilistic interpretation for the GPDs because\nthe requisite matrix element has more the form of a mixed density operator. Decomposition\nof the GPD in terms of light-cone quark and anti-quark modes is presented in Appendix C.\nIn the special case \u03be = 0, one can manipulate the GPDs into true probability distributions\nof quarks with momentum fraction x in impact parameter space [57, 58]. The case for\n\u03be 6= 0 does not have a probabilistic interpretation, however, some physical insight can be\ngained [59].\nHaving motivated the definitions of GPDs from analyzing DVCS and having presented\na brief description of their properties, it makes sense to consider a toy model example of\nGPDs. We do so in the following Section.\n\n3.2\n\nGPDs and the light-front BSE\n\nIn this Section, we cast our results for form factors in the Wick-Cutkosky model [38] in\nthe language of GPDs and the light-cone Fock space expansion. The (3 + 1)-dimensional\nexpressions for form factors are presented in Appendix D. These results are the higher\ndimensional generalizations of the (1 + 1)-dimensional expressions we derived in Section\n2.4. Additionally one can obtain these results directly from time-ordered perturbation\ntheory using two-body projection operators as explicated in Appendix E.\nIn contrast to the proton case (to which we return in Chapter 5), the GPD5 F (x, \u03b6, t)\nfor our meson model is defined by a non-diagonal matrix element of bilocal field operators\nZ\n\u2194\ndy \u2212 ixP + y\u2212\n(3.24)\nh\u03a8P \u2032 | \u03c6(0)i \u2202 + \u03c6(y \u2212 ) |\u03a8P i,\ne\nF (x, \u03b6, t) =\n4\u03c0\n5\n\nNotice we have readily abused notation. Here we use the variable x to denote the active quark's plus\nmomentum fraction in the asymmetric frame. Above in Section 3.1, we used X but now return to the\nWick-Cutkosky model of Chapter 2 where we employed x throughout.\n\n40\n\n\f\u2194\n\n\u2192\n\n\u2190\n\nwhere \u03c6(x) denotes the quark field operator and \u2202 \u03bc = \u2202 \u03bc \u2212 \u2202 \u03bc is the electromagnetic\ncoupling to scalar particles. Here we are considering only the twist-two contribution6 and\nhave taken accordingly the plus-component of the vector current in Eq. (3.24). Comparing to\nthe current matrix element J \u03bc in Appendix D, the definition of the GPD leads immediately\nto the sum rule\nZ\ndx\nF (x, \u03b6, t) = F (t),\n(3.25)\n1 \u2212 \u03b6/2\n\nwhere F (t) is the electromagnetic form factor for our model. Hence one can calculate\nthese distributions from the integrand of the form factor because the non-local light-cone\noperator merely fixes the plus momentum of the active quark. In this way, the light-cone\ncorrelation defined in Eq. (3.24) has a natural description in terms of light-front timeordered perturbation theory, e.g., for x > \u03b6 the relevant graphs contributing to the GPD\nare in Figure 2.6, and those for x < \u03b6 are in Figure 2.7. Conversion of the contributions\n+\nto the\nR form factor into GPDs is straightforward using Eq. (3.25); we merely remove \u22122iP\nand dx from Eqs. (D.13-D.18). These cumbersome expressions are not worth generating\nhere.\n\n3.2.1\n\nContinuity\n\nIn order for the deeply virtual Compton scattering amplitude to factorize into hard and soft\npieces (at leading twist), the GPDs F (x, \u03b6, t) must be continuous at x = \u03b6, see Eq. (3.9).\nThere is no proof of this from QCD, but the power-law scaling seen experimentally allows\nus to infer the GPDs continuity. Maintaining continuity at the crossover is more pressing\nbecause experiments which measure the beam-spin asymmetry are limited to the crossover\n[60]. Let us scrutinize continuity in our results for the Wick-Cutkosky model.\nThe leading-order expressions we have derived for the Wick-Cutkosky model are continuous. This is easy to see since the contribution for x < \u03b6 is identically zero. The\nvalence wavefunction contribution for x > \u03b6 is a convolution of wavefunctions one of which\nis \u03c8 \u2217 (x\u2032 , . . .) which is probed at the end point since x\u2032 \u2261 x\u2212\u03b6\n1\u2212\u03b6 \u2192 0. From the bound-state\nequation Eq. (D.5), we see the two-body wavefunction vanishes quadratically at the end\npoints. Taking into account the overall weight x\u2032\u22121 , the valence piece vanishes linearly at\nthe crossover. At leading order then, continuity is maintained at the crossover, while the\nderivative is discontinuous. Working only in the valence sector, valence quark models will\nnever be of any use to beam-spin asymmetry measurements since the value at the crossover\nrequires one wavefunction to be at an end point.7\nLet us now check the next-to-leading order contributions to the GPD for continuity.\nFirst we shall deal with the term stemming from iterating the Bethe-Salpeter equation for\nthe initial state (D.16) (see diagram B of Figure 2.6). Since there is no corresponding\nZ-graph generated from iterating the initial state, we expect this contribution to vanish.\nLooking at the expression, we see again the factor \u03c8 \u2217 (x\u2032 , . . .)/x\u2032 which vanishes linearly as\nx \u2192 \u03b6. Moreover there are the interaction terms: first D(y, p\u22a5 ; x, k\u22a5 |M 2 ) which is finite\nas x \u2192 \u03b6, and then\nx\u2192\u03b6\n\nD(y \u2032 , p\u2032\u22a5 ; x\u2032 , k\u2032\u22a5 |M 2 ) =\n6\n\n\u2212x\u2032\n,\n(k\u22a5 + \u2206\u22a5 )2 + m2\n\n(3.26)\n\nAdditionally by ignoring self-energy corrections, there is no \u03bc2 dependence in the model.\nIn the three-body bound state problem (e.g. the nucleon), the valence GPD will vanish only if the\nthree-body interaction is non-singular at the end points (which is physically reasonable and perturbatively\ntrue) [61].\n7\n\n41\n\n\fwhich vanishes at the crossover. Thus not only does the initial-state iteration term vanish\nat the crossover, its derivative does so as well.\nNow we investigate the Born terms Eq. (D.14) (see diagram A of Figure 2.6) and\nEq. (D.15) (see diagram D of Figure 2.7) at the crossover. Approaching \u03b6 from above,\nwe use Eq. (D.14), and we have the finite contribution at the crossover\nBorn\n\nF (\u03b6, \u03b6, t)\n\n=\n\nZ\n\ndk\u22a5 dy dp\u22a5\n\u03c8 \u2217 (y \u2032 , p\u2032\u22a5 )\n(16\u03c0 3 )2 y(1 \u2212 y)y \u2032\ng2 \u03b8(y \u2212 \u03b6)/(y \u2212 \u03b6)\n\u00d7 \u22a5\nD(y, p\u22a5 ; \u03b6, k\u22a5 |M 2 )\u03c8(y, p\u22a5 ). (3.27)\n(k + \u2206\u22a5 )2 + m2\n\nOn the other hand, approaching the crossover from below in Eq. (D.15) we have to deal\nwith singularities as x\u2032\u2032 = x/\u03b6 \u2192 1. Writing out the propagator for the quark-antiquark\npair heading off to annihilation, we see\nDW (x\u2032\u2032 , k\u2032\u2032\u22a5 |t) \u2192 \u2212\n\n1 \u2212 x\u2032\u2032\n.\n(k\u22a5 + \u2206\u22a5 )2 + m2\n\n(3.28)\n\nThis linear vanishing cancels the weight (1 \u2212 x\u2032\u2032 )\u22121 . Taking the limit x \u2192 \u03b6 then produces\nequation (3.27) and thus the Born terms are continuous.\nLastly we must see how the final-state iteration terms match up at the crossover. Using\nEq. (D.17) to approach \u03b6 from above (see diagram C of Figure 2.6), we have the contribution\nfinal\n\nF (\u03b6, \u03b6, t)\n\n=\n\nZ\n\ndk\u22a5 dy \u2032 dp\u2032\u22a5\n\u03c8 \u2217 (y \u2032 , p\u2032\u22a5 )\n(16\u03c0 3 )2 (1 \u2212 \u03b6)y \u2032 (1 \u2212 y \u2032 )\ng2 /y\n\u00d7 \u22a5\nD(y, p\u22a5 ; \u03b6, k\u22a5 |M 2 )\u03c8(\u03b6, k\u22a5 ). (3.29)\n(k + \u2206\u22a5 )2 + m2\n\nApproaching \u03b6 from below (see diagram E of Figure 2.7), we utilize equation (3.28) in\ntaking the limit of (D.18). The result is (3.29) and hence we have demonstrated continuity\nto first order, i.e.\nF (\u03b6, \u03b6, t) = F (\u03b6, \u03b6, t)Born + F (\u03b6, \u03b6, t)final\n(3.30)\nno matter how we approach x = \u03b6.\n\n3.2.2\n\nFock space representation\n\nWe now write the derived GPDs in terms of Fock component overlaps. In the diagonal\noverlap region x > \u03b6 this will be a mere rewriting of our results, while there is a subtlety\nfor the non-diagonal overlaps. To handle the zeroth-order term in Eq.

We discuss how to obtain this three-body wavefunction directly from\ntime-ordered perturbation theory in Appendix E. Using \u03c83 in Eq.

(3.37) which does not appear in the figure.\nThis missing diagram is characterized by the spectator quark's one-loop self interaction\nand is absent since we have ignored f (k2 ) and the scale dependence of light-cone wave\nfunctions.8 The absence of this diagram does not affect continuity at the crossover. The\nmissing diagram vanishes at x = \u03b6 since the final-state wavefunction is \u03c8 \u2217 (x\u2032 , . . .), which\nis probed at the end point. Lastly we note the above Fock component overlaps satisfy the\npositivity constraint for a composite scalar composed of scalar constituents [63]. Moreover,\nwith the inclusion of the self-energy loop, the form factor is gauge invariant [43] and hence\n8\n\nRecently the scale dependence of light-cone Fock components in QCD has been investigated [62]. In the\nWick-Cutkosky model, the scale dependence is of course different and leads to different evolution compared\nto perturbative QCD.\n\n43\n\n\fthe GPDs are properly gauged, in the sense that the bilocal light-cone operator is inserted\nin all possible places.\nNow we must come to terms with the non-diagonal overlap region, x < \u03b6. At first\norder, the diagrams of Figure 2.7 correspond to four-to-two Fock component overlaps. We\nhave been cavalier about time ordering, however. The expressions Eqs. (D.15) and (D.18)\ndo not correspond to time-ordered graphs. Both terms contain a product of time-ordered\npropagators: one for the two quarks leading to the final-state vertex and another for the\nquark-antiquark pair heading off to annihilation. But for an interpretation in terms of a\nfour-body wavefunction, all four particles must propagate at the same time. This is a subtle\nissue as a graph containing the product of two independently time-ordered pieces (where\none leads to a bound-state vertex) corresponds to a sum of infinitely many time-ordered\ngraphs. It is easiest to write out the relevant pieces in terms of the propagators' poles. The\nquark, anti-quark heading to annihilation have propagators d(k) and d(k + \u2206) and poles we\nlabel ka\u2212 and kc\u2212 , respectively. The remaining propagators of interest d(p\u2032 ) and d(P \u2032 \u2212 p\u2032 )\n\u2212\nhave poles p\u2212\na and pb , respectively. We can then manipulate as follows\n!\n1\n1\n1\n1\n1\n.\n(3.38)\n\u2212 = \u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212 + \u2212\nkc\u2212 \u2212 ka\u2212 p\u2212\npb \u2212 p\u2212\np\u2212\nkc \u2212 ka\u2212\na + kc \u2212 ka\nb \u2212 pa\nb \u2212 pa\nIn this form, we have produced the correct energy denominator for the instant of light-front\ntime where four particles are propagating. Multiplying this denominator by the three-body\nwavefunction yields the four-body wavefunction (up to constants). This is the part of the\nfour-body wavefunction relevant for GPDs (there are additional pieces for two-quark, twoboson states, see Appendix E). In the resulting sum Eq. (3.38), the first term will produce\nthe two-body wavefunction for the final state and we have a genuine four-to-two overlap.\nWe do not write this out explicitly.\nThe second term in Eq. (3.38), however, contains again the propagator for the pair\nheading to annihilation. Using the light-front Bethe-Salpeter equation for the vertex (which\ncontains infinitely many times) we can introduce a factor of the time-ordered interaction.\nThe resulting product of independent time orderings can again be manipulated as in Eq.\n(3.38). The result produces another overall four-body denominator which contributes to the\nfour-body Fock component of the initial state. Since we iterated the interaction, however,\nthis new contribution is no longer at leading order and can be neglected. Thus the second\nterm in (3.38) does not contribute at this order.\nHaving manipulated the GPDs into non-diagonal overlaps for x < \u03b6, we must wonder if\ncontinuity at the crossover is still maintained. In the limit x \u2192 \u03b6 the light-front energy of the\nstruck quark goes to infinity. Consequently kc\u2212 , which contains this on shell energy, is infinite\nand dominates the four-body energy denominator. This is identical to the reasoning in\nEqs. (D.15) and (D.18) where instead of the four-body denominator, we have the propagator\nDW (x\u2032\u2032 , k\u22a5 + x\u2032\u2032 \u2206\u22a5 |t), which is dominated by kc\u2212 at the crossover. Either way, we arrive\nat the expressions found above for the crossover Eqs. (3.27) and (3.29).\nHaving cast our expressions for generalized parton distributions in terms of the Fock\ncomponents, we can enlarge our understanding of the sum rule and continuity at the\ncrossover. Both must deal with the relation between higher Fock components. The way\n\u03b6-dependence disappears from Eq. (3.25) mandates a relation between the diagonal and\nnon-diagonal Fock component overlaps that make up the GPD. Such a relation between\nFock components must follow from the field-theoretic equations of motion. Continuity itself\nis a special case of the relation between Fock components, specifically at the end points.\n44\n\n\fAbove we have seen our expressions are continuous (and non-vanishing) at the crossover\nand explicitly that the three- and four-body components match at the end point (where\nx \u2212 \u03b6 = 0). This weak binding model for behavior at the crossover is a simple example of\nthe relations between Fock components at the end points9 . More general relations must be\npermitted from the equations of motion to guarantee Lorentz covariance (e.g. in the structure of the Mellin moments of the GPDs, of which the sum rule is a special case). Here, of\ncourse, Lorentz symmetry is violated. Infinitely many light-cone time-ordered graphs are\nneeded in the reduced kernel to reproduce the covariant one-boson exchange (2.33). Thus\nexactly satisfying polynomiality requires not only infinitely many exchanges in the kernel\nbut contributions from infinitely many Fock components. It should be possible, however,\nto show how the sum rule and polynomiality are improved order by order.\n\n3.2.3\n\nSummary\n\nAbove we have investigated the application of the light-front reduction of current matrix\nelements to GPDs. In Appendix D, we reviewed the derivation of the form factor at nextto-leading order in the (3 + 1)-dimensional ladder model. These expressions were then\nconverted into the GPD for the model. Continuity of these distributions at the crossover\n(where the plus momentum of the struck quark is equal to the plus component of the\nmomentum transfer) was explicitly demonstrated, cf Eq. (3.30). Connection was made to\nthe overlap representation of GPDs by constructing the three-body wavefunction to leading\norder in perturbation theory. As a check on our results, we also reviewed the construction of\nhigher Fock states from the valence sector in old-fashioned time-ordered perturbation theory\n(Appendix E). The derived overlaps Eqs. (3.32) and (3.37) satisfy the relevant positivity\nconstraint. The non-vanishing of the GPDs at the crossover could then be tied to higher\nFock components, specifically at vanishing plus momentum, and are hence essential for any\nphenomenological modeling of these distributions. This rewriting allowed us to understand\nhow continuity arises perturbatively from the small-x behavior of Fock state wavefunctions.\nIn perturbation theory, the diagonal valence overlap vanishes at the crossover, while the\nhigher Fock component overlaps do not. In general the n-to-n overlap matches up with the\n(n + 1)-to-(n \u2212 1) overlap at the crossover due to the dominance of the rebounding quark's\ninfinite energy. In essence, no matter how complicated the higher Fock component is, the\nevents in the last instant of light-cone time must simplify. Either the active quark does\nnot interact in this time, for which the contribution vanishes, or else there is an interaction\nwhich then reduces to a contribution of a Fock component with two fewer particles. This\nis true to all orders in perturbation theory and holds for bound states of any number of\nparticles due to the nature of the time-ordered kernel and light-cone perturbation theory.\nUnfortunately issues involving Lorentz invariance (such as the sum rule for the electromagnetic form factor and the polynomiality constraints) are left untouched. To maintain\ncovariance one would need infinitely many time-ordered exchanges in the kernel as well as\ninfinitely many Fock components. It should be possible, however, to understand perturbatively how the \u03b6-dependence disappears from Eq. (3.25). This requires further relations\nbetween Fock components and these should be afforded by the field-theoretic equations of\nmotion. An additional application of the reduction formalism for currents is to calculate the\ntime-like form factor. As seen in Appendix F and in [38], we calculate the ladder model's\ngeneralized distribution amplitude, which is related to the time-like form factor via a sum\n9\n\nThe known Fock component end-point relations in gauge theory derived in [64] do not shed light on the\ncontinuity of GPDs.\n\n45\n\n\frule similar to Eq. (3.25). This is in contrast to the non-existent Fock space expansion for\nthese types of processes. Thus the reduction formalism succeeds in generating contributions\nwhere the light-cone Fock component wavefunctions cannot be employed.\nWith the formalism explored here, one could use phenomenological Lagrangian based\nmodels to explore both generalized parton distributions and generalized distributions amplitudes within the light-front framework. Such an investigation is interesting not only for\ntesting phenomenological models, but also for anticipating problems for approximate nonperturbative solutions for the light-cone Fock states. Nonetheless more model studies are\nwarranted before truly realistic calculations can be pursued. In particular, in light of our\ndiscussion continuity of GPDs may be transparent in light-cone time-ordered perturbation\ntheory, but one must go beyond the toy model considered above and include spin degrees\nof freedom.\n\n3.3\n\nLimitations\n\nIn order to assess future data on GPDs one needs phenomenological parameterizations for\nthe new distributions. The goal of the rest of this work is construct one. For ordinary\nquark distributions, one has a variety of forms invented by hand, as it were. For GPDs\nhowever, the constraints do not permit such cavalier parameterizations. Additionally the\nparametrization should be simple enough to be readily accessible to experimentalists. Let\nus first review a few types of models that could be utilized for GPDs. This will lead us to\ndouble distributions (DDs) which are taken up in subsequent Chapters.\nAbove we have seen the difficulties encountered when applying light-cone wavefunctions\nto calculate GPDs. The kinematical region \u2212\u03be < x < \u03be necessarily involves higher Fock\ncomponents of the bound state. In light-front phenomenology these are rarely considered.\nAlthough we derived these components perturbatively in the Wick-Cutkosky model, one\nultimately must sacrifice Lorentz covariance to make the problem numerically tractable,\neven at weak coupling. Violation of Lorentz symmetry is undesirable for GPD models.\nThe essence of the distributions is the dependence on the skewness variable \u03be. In terms\nof the form factor, we can understand GPDs via the calculation of the form factor in an\narbitrary frame labeled by \u03be (we will appreciate this better in Chapter 4). Viewed from\nthis perspective, the sum rule's lack of dependence on \u03be is due to the freedom to choose\narbitrary frames in which to calculate the Lorentz invariant form factor. A virtue of GPDs\nis the ability to measure correlations which otherwise vanish due to Lorentz invariance in\nsingle current matrix elements. The polynomiality restrictions of GPD moments are further\nmanifestations of Lorentz invariance and are additionally spoiled by light-front calculations.\nThese observations about light-cone wavefunction calculations of GPDs are generally\ntrue of quark models as well. The reason quark models fail to be useful for GPDs stems\nfrom their non-relativistic nature coupled with the restriction to a fixed number of particles.\nIf one were to utilize a Poincar\u00e9 covariant framework to calculate GPDs in terms of a fixed\nnumber of constituents, the kinematic region \u2212\u03be < x < \u03be will be a complication. In this\nframework, one must ultimately deal with constructing dynamical operators consistent with\nPoincar\u00e9 covariance in order to express the GPDs. In order to ensure Lorentz invariance, one\nmust return to the general two photon amplitude and construct according to the Poincar\u00e9\nsymmetries. This procedure is likely to be inconsistent with asymptotic freedom as the\ndynamics required for Poincar\u00e9 invariance of the two photon amplitude have nothing to do\nwith perturbative QCD in the asymptotic limit.\n\n46\n\n\f\u0001\u0002\n+\n\nFigure 3.3: Proper gauging of the DSE for the three-point function with the non-local lightcone operator (denoted by a cross). The Ball-Chiu Ansatz cannot be used to resolve the\nactive quark .\nIn non-relativistic scenarios, one also has the problem of support. Ordinary PDFs calculated in non-relativistic quark models extend beyond x \u2208 [0, 1] and this trouble naturally\ncarries over to GPDs. Moreover, one is lead non-relativistically to little or no contribution\nin the region \u2212\u03be < x < \u03be, and the distributions will likely vanish at the crossover x = \u03be.\nRemoving these weaknesses of model GPDs by using evolution is unsatisfactory because one\nthen relies solely upon perturbative QCD for the non-perturbative physics absent from the\noriginal model. Besides, this is considerable work when alternatively the gross qualitative\nfeatures of PDFs can be obtained more simply from suitable evolution of the distribution\nf1 (x) = \u03b4(x \u2212 1/3). By analogy one can forgo the entire the issue of \u03be dependence, use the\nAnsatz : H(x, \u03be, t) = f1 (x)F1 (t), and hope for the best. Ultimately this parametrization\nwill not be quantitative enough for interpreting data.\nBeyond quark models, an approach that we considered in some detail was the calculation\nof GPDs from Dyson-Schwinger equation (DSE) models [65, 66]. The Dyson-Schwinger\napproach features Lorentz covariance and attempts to model self-consistently the solutions\nto field theories. Both of these qualities are desirable from the point of view of GPDs because\nrelativity is borne in and there is no fixed particle restriction in field theory. Unfortunately,\ncurrent Dyson-Schwinger model approaches, which fall into two classes, are incompatible\nwith the properties of GPDs as we now explain.\nThe first class of DSE models involves solving the covariant DSEs in a truncation scheme,\nsuch as the rainbow-ladder truncation. The solution of these equations requires treatment\nin Euclidean space and the connection to light-cone dominated amplitudes is hence generally lost. The singularity structure of propagators and vertices must be known in the\nwhole complex plane to enable calculation of PDFs or GPDs. Clearly this cannot be done\nwith a numerical solution in a limited domain. Imagining that GPDs could be obtained\nin the rainbow-ladder truncation scheme, one has the additional complication of the positivity bounds. It is unclear whether non-perturbative truncation schemes are consistent\nwith positivity. Part of this uncertainty stems from a lack of knowledge of the analytic\ncontinuation, in particular the way to assess contributions from the infinite light-cone singularities of the bound-state vertex. On the other hand, an interesting application of these\nDSE models would be to calculate the moments of PDFs and GPDs since the calculation of\nmatrix elements of twist-two operators can be carried out in Euclidean space. Surprisingly\nthis territory is largely unexplored.\nThe second class of DSE models relies upon using Ans\u00e4tze for the various vertex functions and propagators. Additionally field theoretic constraints arising from Ward-Takahashi\nidentities are imposed, although the solutions to these constraints are not uniquely specified\n47\n\n\fby the model elements. This class of models has the same drawbacks for calculating GPDs\nas the first class. One again has difficulty connecting the Euclidean space formulation of\nthese models with light-cone correlation functions. Moreover, entire functions are often\nused for model elements and these in turn defy a description of PDFs and GPDs because\nthe integral over the relative light-cone energy does not converge in the complex plane. It\nis clear for this class of models that the positivity bounds must be generally violated. This\nis because an ad hoc bound state vertex cannot be gauged with the non-local light-cone\noperator. Correctly inserting the non-local operator at the bounds state vertex, which ensures the positivity bound is respected, requires knowledge of the underlying field theoretic\ndynamics.\nLastly there is an additional problem present in this second class of DSE models due to\nthe incorrect treatment of higher point functions. The well-known Ball-Chiu form for the\nelectromagnetic vertex [67] is used in these models to describe an electromagnetic threepoint function that is consistent with the Ward-Takahashi identity. The Ball-Chiu vertex,\nhowever, cannot be used for PDFs or GPDs because one needs to gauge the three-point\nfunction with the non-local light-cone operator and this requires knowledge of the fourpoint function [29, 30, 68], see Figure 3.3. As is, the Ball-Chiu Ansatz cannot fix the plus\nmomentum of the active quark because it models the sum of the ungauged diagrams in\nthe Figure. The individual contributions cannot be resolved and hence cannot be properly\ngauged.\nClearly the consistent modeling of GPDs is a difficult problem. Most standard hadronic\nmodels cannot be used in their present forms to calculate GPDs. Furthermore investigating\nhow to rectify such models with the properties required of GPDs is lengthy and not particularly illuminating, when one considers that the models have no transparent relation to\nQCD. Thus it makes sense to consider only simple models whereby one can guarantee the\nproperties of GPDs will be satisfied from the onset, and the resulting parametrization will\nbe efficaciously tractable for comparison with experiment. To devise such models, we turn\nour attention to double distributions.\n\n48\n\n\fChapter 4\n\nDouble Distributions\nModeling GPDs directly from their definition leads to light-cone quantization and lightcone wavefunctions. Another approach is to use the formalism of double distributions\n(DDs) [69, 70] and this is the discourse taken up in the rest of this work. The formalism\nof DDs elegantly explains the polynomiality conditions required of GPDs and thus gives\none the ability to construct models consistent with known properties-although insight into\nmodel construction has often been limited to factorization Ans\u00e4tze. Very few DDs have actually been calculated, although ad hoc DDs are almost exclusively used for phenomenology.\nRecently two-body light-front wavefunction models of the pion have been used to obtain\nGPDs [71] based on DDs. Without modifying the quark distribution, the resulting GPDs\nviolate the positivity constraints [63]. This inconsistency is attributed to missing contributions from non-wavefunction vertex diagrams the contribution of which are unknown when\none uses non-covariant vertices. In general these diagrams are a substitute for higher Fock\ncomponents, see [72]. Thus the method used by [71] must at least use covariant wavefunctions to be sensible. The covariant models we used [73], however, allowed us to test the\nuniqueness of this ostensible construction. In this Chapter, we present the two models which\nwere used to test the construction of DD functions. The two models are both simple models\nfor scalar bound states, one with scalar constituents and the other with spin- 12 constituents.\nIndeed we found that appealing to Lorentz invariance is enough to determine only one\ncomponent of the double distribution in the two-component formalism (even for C-odd\ndistributions, where the Polyakov-Weiss D-term [74] is absent). Moreover, the component\ndetermined from the reduction relations in the scheme presented by [71] is completely ambiguous. Below we show that in the scalar constituent model, missing the second component\nleads to incorrect GPDs. The same is true for a spin- 12 constituent model of the pion, where\nadditionally the positivity bound is violated. The correct DDs unique to each model can be\ncalculated from non-diagonal matrix elements of twist-two operators and is demonstrated.\nOn the other hand, exploiting the ambiguity inherent in defining one component DDs (which\nis akin to gauge freedom [75]) one can generate infinitely many different GPD models which\nshare the same form factor and quark distribution as well as satisfy polynomiality (and\nlikely positivity). We also calculate DDs for a model with a propagator having complex\nconjugate energy poles. Such a parametrization is an efficacious way to model confinement.\nThe calculation produces no trouble in Euclidean space, while the difficulties in Minkowski\nspace are dealt with in Appendix G.\nThe organization of the Chapter is as follows. After defining DDs in Section 4.1, we\nexplicitly derive the GPD for the scalar triangle diagram with point-like vertices in Section\n\n49\n\n\f4.2.1. This is the GPD for the toy BSE model in Section 1.2.2. Next we show the DD\nfor this model extracted from the form factor in the Drell-Yan frame via [71] leads to\nincorrect GPDs. Having encountered this problem, we calculate the missing component\nof the DD for the scalar triangle diagram in Section 4.2.2. Then in Section 4.2.3, we\npresent a calculation of the DD for a similar model where the propagator is extended to\nhave complex conjugate poles. The calculation is done in Euclidean space here and in\nMinkowski space in Appendix G. In Section 4.3, we move on to the model for the spin- 21\ncase. Next in Section 4.3.2, we regularize the current and then extract this model's GPD.\nAlthough not manifest, this model satisfies polynomiality, which is demonstrated in Section\n4.3.3. Using [71] as a guide, we construct a DD for this model in Section 4.3.4. Similar\nto Section 4.2.1, this one-component DD too gives rise to a different GPD than the lightfront projection. Additionally positivity is not satisfied by this one-component DD (Section\n4.3.5). We calculate the complete two-component DD from matrix elements of twist-two\noperators in Section 4.3.6. Lastly we conclude with a brief summary (Section 4.4).\n\n4.1\n\nDefinitions\n\nIn this Section we define DDs for scalar bound states via their moments by following the\ntwo-component formalism of [74, 75]. Focusing on the ambiguities inherent in defining onecomponent DDs from two component objects, we will understand why the DD constructed\naccording to [71] leads to an incorrect GPD. Moreover, we shall calculate the correct DD\nfor the scalar triangle diagram from matrix elements of twist-two operators. We remark\nin passing that the two components of the DD (below F and G, or F and D-term in the\nstandard formalism) can be viewed as projections of a single function of two variables [76].\nIn defining GDPs and DDs there are two convenient choices of variables to use. Above\nwe have worked in Radyushkin's asymmetrical frame and asymmetrical variables which\nare ideal for perturbation theory and are a natural generalization of ordinary parton distributions. The non-diagonal matrix elements of twist-two operators are, however, more\nconveniently expressed in variables symmetric with respect to initial and final states.1 To\n\u2194\n\n\u2192\n\n\u2190\n\nthis end we define the average momentum P \u03bc = (P + P \u2032 )\u03bc /2. Let D \u03bc = 21 (\u2202 \u03bc \u2212 \u2202 \u03bc ).

This is the model considered in Section 1.2.2. Furthermore, we choose derivative\ncoupling of the photon to charged scalar particles.\nThe meson electromagnetic form factor for this model can be calculated from the Feynman triangle diagram. In order to derive the GPD, however, we need to choose the kinematics specified in Figure 4.1 with k as the momentum of the struck quark. Using the\nstated meson vertex and taking the plus-component of the current, we have\nZ\n\u0003\u0002\n\u0003\u0002\n\u0003o\u22121\n\u2212i|N |2 (2k+ + \u2206+ ) n\u0002 2\n2\n2\n2\n2\n2\nF (t) = d4 k\nk\n\u2212\nm\n+\ni\u01eb\n(k\n+\n\u2206)\n\u2212\nm\n+\ni\u01eb\n(P\n\u2212\nk)\n\u2212\nm\n+\ni\u01eb\n,\n(1 \u2212 \u03b6/2)P +\n(4.9)\nwhere the momentum transfer is t = \u22062 and the skewness is defined relative to the initial state \u2206+ = \u2212\u03b6P + < 0. Physically \u03b6 plays the role of Bjorken variable for DVCS.\nAdditionally we work in the asymmetric frame where P\u22a5 = 0.\nTo turn Eq. (4.9) into an expression for the GPD H(x, \u03b6, t), we insert \u03b4(k+ /P + \u2212 x) to\nfix the momentum of the struck quark and keep \u03b6 6= 0. This forces\nZ\nF (t) = H(x, \u03b6, t)dx.\n(4.10)\nLastly we integrate over k\u2212 to project onto the light cone. Doing the contour integration\n\n52\n\n\fto extract H(x, \u03b6, t) in Eq.

(4.13) are in order. The model is covariant\nand thus the sum rule and polynomiality conditions are met (see Section 4.3.3 below for\nclarification). We have checked this explicitly and suitable discussion can be found in [78,79].\nConsideration of this model without derivative coupling was first done from the perspective\nof DDs, see e.g. the toy model of [69]. This DD model was revisited recently with derivative\ncoupling at the photon vertex in the Appendix of [71] and the same DD also appears in [78].\nTo derive the DD for this simple model, we first appeal to Lorentz invariance as suggested\nin [71], recalling along the way the relevant properties of DDs in asymmetric variables.\nFirst consider the form factor. In the \u03b6 = 0 frame, Eqs. (4.14\u20134.15) reduce to the\nDrell-Yan formula [36, 80] via the definition in Eq. (4.10)\n2\n\nF (t) = |N |\n\nZ\n\ndxdk\u22a5\nDW (x, k\u22a5 |M\u03c02 )DW (x, k\u22a5 + (1 \u2212 x)\u2206\u22a5 |M\u03c02 ),\nx(1 \u2212 x)\n\n(4.17)\n\nwhere t = \u2212\u22062\u22a5 .

The GPDs\nEq. (4.13) (denoted LC) and Eq. (4.23) (DD-based) are plotted as a function of x for fixed\n\u03b6 = 0.7 and t = \u2212m2 for the mass M\u03c0 = m < 2m. We also plot the difference between\nthe two curves (\u03b4). The area under the curves is identically F (\u2212m2 ) for LC and DD-based\nGPDs, and hence zero for their difference \u03b4.\n\nThe DD satisfies the following relations [70]: support property\nF (x, y; t) \u221d \u03b8(1 \u2212 x \u2212 y),\nreduction to the quark distribution at zero momentum transfer\nZ 1\u2212x\nF (x, y; 0) dy\nq(x) =\n\n(4.19)\n\n(4.20)\n\n0\n\nand is M\u00fcnchen symmetric [81]\nF (x, y; t) = F (x, 1 \u2212 x \u2212 y; t).\n\n(4.21)\n\nUsing Eq.

(4.19\u20134.21). The ingenuity of DDs comes about when we construct the\nGPD via\nZ 1Z 1\nF (z, y; t)\u03b4(x \u2212 z \u2212 \u03b6y) dy dz.\n(4.23)\nH(x, \u03b6, t) =\n0\n\n0\n\nIn this form the sum rule and polynomiality conditions follow trivially.\nIn Figure 4.2, we plot the GPD Eq. (4.13) as well as the GPD derived from DD via\nEq. (4.23). Surprisingly the two are different despite the fact both models are covariant and\nposses the same form factor and quark distribution. Additionally we plot their difference\n(\u03b4) as a function of x.\n\n4.2.2\n\nScalar model, revisited\n\nBased on the definitions in Eq. (4.1), we need more than the form factor to determine the\nGPDs. The procedure above thus missed one component of the DDs. To correctly derive\n\n54\n\n\fboth F and G DDs for the scalar triangle diagram of Section 4.2.1, we must now consider\n\u2194\n\n\u2194\n\n\u2194\n\nthe action of the operator 2iD {\u03bc iD \u03bc1 * * * iD \u03bcn } .

(4.2)\nand (4.3), namely3\nF (\u03b2, \u03b1; t) = \u03b2 \u03b8(1 \u2212 \u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1)D(\u03b2, \u03b1; t)|N |2\n\n(4.27)\n\n2\n\nG(\u03b2, \u03b1; t) = \u03b1 \u03b8(1 \u2212 \u03b2 \u2212 \u03b1)D(\u03b2, \u03b1; t)|N | .\n\n(4.28)\n\nTo compare with the results of Section 4.2.1, we must revert to asymmetric variables which\nis accomplished by the transformation \u03b2 \u2192 x, y \u2192 (\u03b1\u2212\u03b2 +1)/2. The denominator common\nto both terms becomes\nD(x, y; t) =\n\n1\n,\nm2 \u2212 x(1 \u2212 x)M\u03c02 \u2212 y(1 \u2212 x \u2212 y)t\n\n(4.29)\n\nand we have\nF (x, y; t) = x \u03b8(1 \u2212 x \u2212 y)D(x, y; t)|N |2\n\n(4.30)\n2\n\nG(x, y; t) = (2y + x \u2212 1) \u03b8(1 \u2212 x \u2212 y)D(x, y; t)|N | .\n\n(4.31)\n\nNotice the function G(x, y; t) is M\u00fcnchen antisymmetric, i.e. G(x, y; t) = \u2212G(x, 1\u2212 x\u2212 y; t),\nwhich is required because G(\u03b2, \u03b1; t) is odd with respect to \u03b1.\nTo construct the GPD H(x, \u03b6, t) we must also convert Eq. (4.6) to asymmetric variables.\nH(x, \u03b6, t) =\n\nZ\n\n1\n\ndz\n0\n\nZ\n\n1\u2212z\n0\n\nh\ndy \u03b4(x \u2212 z \u2212 \u03b6y) F (x, y; t) +\n\ni\n\u03b6\nG(x, y; t)\n2\u2212\u03b6\n\n(4.32)\n\nWe can now plot the GPD calculated from Eq. (4.32) using the two DDs in Eqs. (4.30) and\n(4.31). The result agrees with Eq. (4.13) depicted in Figure 4.2. Moreover, the contribution\n\u03b6\nfrom 2\u2212\u03b6\nG is identically the difference \u03b4 plotted in the figure. In the DD formalism, the\nreduction relations do not determine the GPD. We will illustrate this further with a spin- 21\nmodel for the pion. Before doing so, however, we will take a detour to pursue an interesting\nextension of the above scalar model.\n3\nNotice in this case we can see that F and G are projections of a single function D(\u03b2, \u03b1; t) = f (\u03b2, \u03b1) in\nthe notation of [76]. Determination of f (\u03b2, \u03b1) for the spin- 21 model of Section 4.3, however, cannot be done\nby inspection.\n\n55\n\n\f4.2.3\n\nComplex conjugate poles\n\nIn this Section, we extend the calculation of the model DD above to include complex\nconjugate singularities in the constituents' propagators. Complex conjugate singularities\npresent in solutions to Dyson-Schwinger equations have been studied in the connection\nwith the violation of Osterwalder-Schrader reflection positivity and confinement [82\u201389].\nRecent work [90] in solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation with a quark propagator consisting\nof pairs of complex conjugate singularities shows that the width for meson decay (into free\nquarks) generated from one pole is exactly canceled by the contribution from its complex\nconjugate. Additionally recent studies have modeled Euclidean space lattice data with\npropagators that have time-like complex conjugate singularities [91\u201393]. In [94] we pursued\nthe calculation of space-like amplitudes in Minkowski space using a simple model propagator\nconsisting of a pair of complex conjugate poles. Specifically, we were interested in the\ncalculation of light-cone dominated amplitudes for this type of model which necessitates\na treatment in Minkowski space. This treatment is contained in Appendix G because\nthere is considerable subtlety. Nonetheless, covariant calculation in Euclidean space is\nstraightforward and provides another chance to obtain DDs properly.\nIn Euclidean space, the model propagator is chosen to be\nSE (k) =\n\n1/2\n.\n2 + m2 \u2212 i\u03b5\nk\n\u03b5=\u00b1\nX\n\n(4.33)\n\nHere and below we use the shorthand \u03b5 = \u00b1 to denote the pair of complex conjugate\npoles. Notice \u03b5 is finite and can be chosen to be positive. Unlike in Minkowski space where\nthe measure is imaginary, contributions to Euclidean space amplitudes are real and one\nhas no difficulty in calculating form factors and distribution functions using SE (k) in the\nrelevant diagrams. The simplicity of the model at hand will allow us to calculate its double\ndistribution analytically and thereby determine the quark distribution and electromagnetic\nform factor, since these functions are related to the double distribution by the so-called\nreduction relations. The difficult task of calculating of these quantities in Minkowski space\nby projecting onto the light-cone is contained in Appendix G.\nGPDs are not Lorentz invariant objects, however, they stem from a projection of a\nLorentz invariant double distribution function [69]. These functions are particularly attractive from the perspective of model building [71], though one must be careful that the starting\npoint is indeed covariant [63], otherwise desirable distribution properties and straightforward physical interpretation may be sacrificed. The model under consideration is fully\ncovariant, and thus the DD representation is an ideal testing ground for our model propagator. Hence we proceed to calculate the model's Euclidean space DD, recalling along the\nway the relevant properties of DDs. In this Section, by contrast to Eq. (4.1), we decompose the matrix elements of twist-two operators in the asymmetric frame, with asymmetric\nvariables.\n\u2192\n\u2190\n\u2194\nLet D \u03bc = \u2202 \u03bc \u2212 \u2202 \u03bc . For this scalar model, we define the twist-two operator of spin-(n+1)\nas above\n\u2194\n\u2194\n\u2194\nO\u03bc\u03bc1 ...\u03bcn = \u03c6(0)iD {\u03bc iD \u03bc1 * * * iD \u03bcn } \u03c6(0),\n(4.34)\n\nwhere the action of {*** } on Lorentz indices produces only the symmetric traceless part.\nWe work in Radyushkin's asymmetric frame with P as the momentum of the initial\nstate, P + \u2206 that of the final and t = \u22062 . The initial and final states are on-shell: P 2 =\n(P + \u2206)2 = M 2 . The non-diagonal matrix element of O\u03bc\u03bc1 ...\u03bcn can be decomposed into\n56\n\n\f\u0001\nk+\u0001\n\nk\n\nk P\n\nP +\u0001\n\nP\n\nFigure 4.3: Diagram used to calculate non-diagonal matrix elements of twist-two operators\n(denoted by a cross).\n\nLorentz invariant moment functions Ank (t) and Bnk (t).

(4.35), e.g., one could rewrite\nthe above with kBn,k\u22121 (t)/(n \u2212 k + 1) as a contribution to Ank (t). Carrying this out for\nall k, puts the bulk in the first term and renders the second term proportional only to the\nsymmetric traceless part of (n + 1) \u2206's- moments of the Polyakov-Weiss D-term [74]. This\nis the usually encountered form of the DD with D-term. Alternatively one can also express\nthe moments as projections of a single Lorentz invariant function [76]. Calculationally,\nhowever, Eq. (4.35) becomes the most practical to work with [73].\nThe F and G DDs can be defined as generators of the coefficient functions\nZ 1 Z 1\u2212x\ndy xn\u2212k (x + 2y \u2212 1)k F (x, y; t)\n(4.36)\ndx\nAnk (t) =\n0\n0\nZ 1 Z 1\u2212x\ndy xn\u2212k (x + 2y \u2212 1)k G(x, y; t).\n(4.37)\ndx\nBnk (t) =\n0\n\n0\n\nAs a consequence of the restriction on k in the sums, the function F (x, y; t) is M\u00fcnchen\nsymmetric [81], i.e. F (x, y; t) = F (x, 1\u2212x\u2212y; t), while G(x, y; t) is M\u00fcnchen antisymmetric.\nAlso for n-even, there is no contribution from the D-term to the function G(x, y; t).\n\n57\n\n\fThese functions then appear in the decomposition of matrix elements of light-like separated operators\n\u2194\n\nh P + \u2206 | \u03c6(0) iz * D \u03c6(z \u2212 ) | P i =\nZ 1 Z\ndx\n(2P * z + \u2206 * z)\n0\n\n1\u2212x\n\ndy e\u2212ixP *z+iy\u2206*z F (x, y; t)\n0\nZ 1 Z 1\u2212x\ndy e\u2212ixP *z+iy\u2206*z G(x, y; t), (4.38)\ndx\n\u2212\u2206*z\n0\n\n0\n\nwhere z 2 = 0.\nDenoting \u03b6 = \u2212\u2206+ /P + > 0, the GPD in asymmetric variables reads\nH(x, \u03b6, t) =\n\n+ \u2212\n\n\u2194\ndz \u2212 eixP z\nh P + \u2206 | \u03c6(0)iD + \u03c6(z \u2212 ) | P i.\n2\u03c0(2 \u2212 \u03b6)\n\nZ\n\n(4.39)\n\nPhysically \u03b6 plays the role of Bjorken variable for deeply virtual Compton scattering. Inserting Eq. (4.38) into this definition yields\nH(x, \u03b6, t) =\n\nZ\n\n1\n\ndz\n0\n\nZ\n\n1\u2212z\n\n0\n\nh\ndy \u03b4(x \u2212 z \u2212 \u03b6y) F (z, y; t) +\n\ni\n\u03b6\nG(z, y; t) .\n2\u2212\u03b6\n\n(4.40)\n\nwhich is what we found circuitously above. By integrating Eq. (4.40) over x, we uncover\ntwo familiar sum rules for the DDs: the sum rule for the form factor\nZ 1 Z 1\u2212x\ndy F (x, y; t) = F (t)\n(4.41)\ndx\n0\n\n0\n\nand the G-sum rule\n\nZ\n\n1\n\ndx\n0\n\nZ\n\n1\u2212x\n\ndy G(x, y; t) = 0,\n\n(4.42)\n\n0\n\nwhich follows after a change of variables since G is M\u00fcnchen antisymmetric. Eq. (4.42) is\nimportant and mandated by current conservation. As we saw above, the G DD function is\nall too frequently overlooked and treated as identically zero. Lastly, the model quark distribution function q(x) can be found from the DD at zero momentum transfer, see Eq. (4.39),\nq(x) =\n\nZ\n\n1\u2212x\n\ndy F (x, y; 0).\n\n(4.43)\n\n0\n\nWe can use the decomposition in Eq. (4.35) to calculate our simple model's DD. Parameterizing the momenta as in Figure 4.3, the non-diagonal matrix element of O(n) reads\nh P + \u2206|O\u03bc\u03bc1 ...\u03bcn |P i =\nZ\n2N X\n(2k + \u2206){\u03bc (2k + \u2206)\u03bc1 * * * (2k + \u2206)\u03bcn }\n4\nd\nk\n\u03c0 2 \u2032 \u2032\u2032\n[k2 + m2 \u2212 i\u03b5][(k + \u2206)2 + m2 \u2212 i\u03b5\u2032 ][(k \u2212 P )2 + m2 \u2212 i\u03b5\u2032\u2032 ]\n\n(4.44)\n\n\u03b5,\u03b5 ,\u03b5 =\u00b1\n\nThe normalization constant N is chosen by the condition F (0) = 1. Let us denote the\npropagators simply by A = (k\u2212P )2 +m2 \u2212i\u03b5\u2032\u2032 , B = (k+\u2206)2 +m2 \u2212i\u03b5\u2032 and C = k2 +m2 \u2212i\u03b5.\nWe introduce two Feynman parameters {x, y} to render the denominator specifically in the\nform [xA + yB + (1 \u2212 x \u2212 y)C]\u22123 . One then translates k\u03bc to render the integral (hyper-)\n58\n\n\fspherically symmetric via the definition k\u03bc = l\u03bc + xP \u03bc \u2212 y\u2206\u03bc . The resulting integral over\nl can be evaluated directly (remember we are in Euclidean space).\nBinomially expanding the result of the integral, we can make contact with Eq. (4.35) and\nsubsequently determine the F and G double distributions by inspection from Eqs. (4.36)\nand (4.37). Defining the auxiliary functions\nDo (x, y; t) = m2 \u2212 x(1 \u2212 x)M 2 \u2212 y(1 \u2212 x \u2212 y)t\nand\nD(x, y; t) = N\n\nX\n\nz=0,x,y,x+y\n\nDo (x, y; t)\n,\nDo (x, y; t)2 + \u03b52 (1 \u2212 2z)2\n\n(4.45)\n\n(4.46)\n\nthe DDs can be written simply as\nF (x, y; t) = xD(x, y; t)\n\n(4.47)\n\nG(x, y; t) = (x + 2y \u2212 1)D(x, y; t).\n\n(4.48)\n\nWe treat factors of \u03b8(1\u2212 x\u2212 y) as implicit above. Accordingly F is M\u00fcnchen symmetric and\nG is antisymmetric. Notice although \u03b5 is finite, corresponding results using the standard\nperturbative propagator can always be recovered in the limit \u03b5 \u2192 0. For example, the\ncorrect F and G DDs are recovered in the limit \u03b5 \u2192 0 [73].\nThe model GPD can be derived by utilizing Eq. (4.40), although the integral must be\nperformed numerically. The quark distribution can be found via the reduction relation\nEq. (4.43), namely\n\"\n#\nX\nx(1 \u2212 x)Do (x, 0; 0)\n\u03b5(1\n\u2212\n2z)\nx\nq(x) = N\n(4.49)\n+ tan\u22121\n2 + \u03b52 (1 \u2212 2z)2\nD\n(x,\n0;\n0)\n\u03b5\nDo (x, 0; 0)\no\nz=0,x\nLastly the form factor can be found from the sum rule Eq. (4.41)\nIn Figure 4.4, we plot the quark distribution and electromagnetic form factor for various\nvalues of \u03b5 in GeV2 . We have arbitrarily chosen the other model parameters as M = 0.14\nGeV and m = 0.33 GeV. Additionally in Figure 4.5, the GPD is plotted: first at fixed\n\u03b6 and t for various values of \u03b5 and then at fixed t and \u03b5 for various values of \u03b6. Curves\ncorresponding to \u03b5 = 0 are the standard results for a propagator with one real pole.\nAbove we considered calculation of amplitudes for space-like processes using a scalar\npropagator with one pair of complex conjugate poles. Moreover the analysis can be extended\neasily to the case where vertex functions have complex conjugate singularities. Such models\ncannot be directly employed in Minkowski space, they must be analytically continued from\nEuclidean space.\nIn Appendix G, the problems of using a propagator with complex conjugate poles in\nMinkowski space are discussed at the level of the quark distribution function. If the model is\ndefined in Minkowski space, one will generally violate the support and positivity properties\nof the quark distribution. Above we showed the model is perfectly well defined in Euclidean\nspace by calculating non-diagonal matrix elements of twist-two operators. This leads us to\nthe model's double distribution which we used to calculate parton and generalized parton\ndistributions as well as the electromagnetic form factor.\n\n59\n\n\f2\n\n\u03b5\n\u03b5\n\u03b5\n\u03b5\n\nF(t)\n\nq(x)\n\n1\n\n\u03b5 = 0.66\n\u03b5 = 0.33\n\u03b5 = 0.17\n\u03b5 = 0.00\n\n3\n\n=\n=\n=\n=\n\n0.66\n0.33\n0.17\n0.00\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n0\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\nx\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n2\n\n20\n\n25\n\n-t (GeV )\n\nFigure 4.4: On the left, the quark distribution Eq.

In this Section, we explore a model for the pion both\non the light cone and from the covariant description in terms of DDs. To calculate the\nDD functions, we again highlight the ambiguity and limitations inherent in the method\nemployed by [71] and then properly determine the DDs.\n\n4.3.1\n\nBethe-Salpeter amplitude and pion wavefunction\n\nFor the spin- 12 model, we choose the trivially q q\u0304 symmetric Bethe-Salpeter vertex\n\u0393(k, P ) = \u2212ig\u03b3 5 .\n\n(4.50)\n\nHere we have assumed only \u03b3 5 coupling at the quark-pion vertex with coupling constant g,\nwhereas four Dirac structures exist [95]. This simple coupling is suggested by an effective\ninteraction Lagrangian of the form (see, e.g., [96, 97])\nLI = \u2212ig \u03c0 * q\u0304\u03b3 5 \u03c4 q,\n\n(4.51)\n\nwhere the coupling constant g = m/f\u03c0 , with m the constituent mass and f\u03c0 the pion decay\nconstant. Notice the (ladder approximation) kernel is independent of light-cone time. Thus\nthis model (as well as the scalar triangle model in Section 4.2.1) are special cases of the\ninstantaneous formalism described by [30] in the impulse approximation. The relation of\nthe vertex to the Bethe-Salpeter wavefunction is given by\n\u03a8(k, P ) =\n\ni\ni\n(\u2212ig)\u03b3 5\n.\nk \u2212 m + i\u01eb\n/\n/ \u2212 /P \u2212 m + i\u01eb\nk\n\n(4.52)\n\nThe valence wavefunction can be found by projecting the Bethe-Salpeter wavefunction\nonto the light-cone x+ = 0, see e.g. [98]. Using the normalization convention of [3], we have\n\u0001\n+\n\u22a5\n\u22a5\n\u2032\ndk\u2212 \u016b\u03bb (xP + , k\u22a5 ) +\n+ v\u03bb (1 \u2212 x)P , P \u2212 k\n\u221a\n\u221a\n\u03b3 \u03a8(k, P )\u03b3\n,\n2\u03c0\nx\n1\u2212x\n(4.53)\nwhere x is the fraction of the pion's plus momentum carried by the quark (x = k+ /P + ),\n\u22a5\n\u22a5\nand the relative transverse momentum is k\u22a5\nrel = k \u2212 xP . The valence wavefunction is\nfound from Eq. (4.53) to be\np\nh\ni\ng Nc /2 C\n\u22a5\n\u2032\nDW (x, k\u22a5 |M\u03c02 ) k\u2212\u03bb \u03b4\u03bb,\u03bb\u2032 \u2212 \u03bbm \u03b4\u03bb,\u2212\u03bb\u2032 ,\n(4.54)\n\u03c8(x, k ; \u03bb, \u03bb ) =\nx(1 \u2212 x)\n\u2032\n\u03c8(x, k\u22a5\nrel ; \u03bb, \u03bb )\n\n1\n=\n2P +\n\nZ\n\nwhere we have employed the notation k\u03bb = k1 + i\u03bbk2 . As a result of the contour integration, we have a factor of \u03b8[x(1 \u2212 x)] implicitly in Eq. (4.54). Additionally the wavefunction\nis symmetric under interchange of x and 1 \u2212 x. As is known, introduction of orbital angular momentum into this wavefunction leads to divergent quark distributions and form\nfactors which will be handled below. Since this model is non-renormalizable, the choice of\nregularization scheme influences the dynamics.\n\n61\n\n\f4.3.2\n\nForm factor and generalized parton distribution\n\nThe pion electromagnetic form factor for this model can be calculated from the Feynman\ntriangle diagram. In order to extract the GPD, however, we need to choose the kinematics\nspecified in Figure 4.1 with k as the momentum of the struck quark. As it stands, using\nthe wavefunction Eq. (4.54), the triangle diagram diverges. Following the approach of [99],\nwe covariantly smear the point-like photon vertex in Figure 4.1 in a way reminiscent of\nPauli-Villars regularization\n\u03b3 \u03bc \u2192 \u0393\u03bc\u039b =\n\n\u039b2\n\u039b2\n\u03bc\n\u03b3\n.\nk2 \u2212 \u039b2 + i\u01eb (k + \u2206)2 \u2212 \u039b2 + i\u01eb\n\n(4.55)\n\nEq. (4.55) is a simple way to model non-q q\u0304 components of the wavefunction.4 Alternatively\none could smear the q q\u0304 \u2212 \u03c0 vertex in a covariant manner [31,32,100]. This smearing should\nadditionally respect the q q\u0304 symmetry of the vertex. We do not pursue this option here since\npositivity constraints (see Section 4.3.5) are generally violated. On the other hand, one\ncould use Pauli-Villars subtractions to regulate the theory, however, positivity would also\nbe put into question. Because our concern is with model comparisons not phenomenology,\nwe shall choose \u039b = m merely for simplicity. Although not obvious from inspection, results\nfor \u039b 6= m exhibit the same features investigated below. Most noteworthy, positivity remains\nsatisfied when \u039b 6= m.\nConsidering matrix elements of the current operator J \u03bc between pion states, the model\nEq. (4.55) conserves current. This can be demonstrated most easily by calculating \u2206 * J\nin the Breit frame. Additionally since the model is fully covariant, we can extract the\nelectromagnetic form factor from any component of the current. In particular, potential\nend-point singularities present in matrix elements of J \u2212 have been removed by the photon\nvertex smearing Eq. (4.55) [99]. Using the plus-component of the current, we have the\nexpression\ni\nh\n5 (/\n5 (/\n+\nZ\nTr\n(/\nk\n+\nm)\u03b3\nk\n\u2212\nP\n/\n+\nm)\u03b3\nk\n+\n\u2206\n/\n+\nm)\u03b3\n4\n2\n2\n4\nd k\nig Nc |C| m\nF (t) =\n\u0002\n\u0003 \u0002\n\u0003 \u0002\n\u0003,\n\u03b6\n(2\u03c0)4 k2 \u2212 m2 + i\u01eb 2 (k + \u2206)2 \u2212 m2 + i\u01eb 2 (P \u2212 k)2 \u2212 m2 + i\u01eb\n1\u2212 2\n(4.56)\nwhere the momentum transfer is t = \u22062 and the skewness \u03b6 is defined relative to the initial\nstate: \u2206+ = \u2212\u03b6P + < 0.\nTo calculate the GPD, we follow the procedure described in Section 4.2.1. The result\ncan be written as\n(1 \u2212 \u03b6/2)H(x, \u03b6, t) = \u03b8(x \u2212 \u03b6)Heff (x, \u03b6, t) + \u03b8(\u03b6 \u2212 x) [(Hinst (x, \u03b6, t) + Hnval (x, \u03b6, t)] . (4.57)\nwhere Heff is the piece determined by the effective two-body wavefunction, Hinst is the\ncontribution from instantaneous propagation of the spectator quark, and the remaining\ncontributions we term non-valence (although strictly speaking the instantaneous piece is\nalso of the non-valence variety). It is a peculiarity of this model that explicit instantaneous\nterms are not present for x > \u03b6.\n4\nFor all its positivity preserving virtues, the vertex smearing has unphysical drawbacks. Firstly the\nWard-Takahashi identity is messed up. Secondly the large momentum behavior of the induced constituent\nquark form factor is inconsistent with asymptotic freedom.

It is sensible to think of Eq. (4.61) as\nan effective wavefunction since x \u2192 1 \u2212 x symmetry has been lost. Moreover the wavefunction vanishes at x = 1 and is non-vanishing at x = 0. This is a desirable addition to the\ndynamics stemming from the regularization. Notice the ladder kernel (4.51) is momentum\nindependent and hence does not vanish at x = 0, 1. This is the dynamical reason why the\nun-regularized wavefunction Eq. (4.54) does not vanish at the end points. Continuity of the\nGPD at x = \u03b6 follows directly from Eqs. (4.58\u20134.60).\nIn Figure 4.6, we plot the GPD for the parameters: M = 0.14 MeV and m = 0.33 MeV.\nOn the left, the graph shows the GPD for a few values of \u03b6 as a function of x for fixed t,\nwhile on the right we have fixed \u03b6 and t varying.\n\n4.3.3\n\nSum rule and polynomiality\n\nSince not manifest, one should check the covariance of the model Eq. (4.57). With the\ncovariant starting point Eq. (4.56), we anticipate polynomiality will be satisfied which provides a useful check on our expressions Eqs. (4.58\u20134.60). First we define the moments of\nthe GPD with respect to asymmetric variables\nZ\nPn (\u03b6, t) = xn H(x, \u03b6, t)dx.\n(4.62)\n63\n\n\fPn(\u03b6,t=0)\n1\n\n0.5\n\n00\n\nP0\nP1\nP2\nP3\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n\u03b6\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nFigure 4.7: Polynomiality conditions checked for the GPD Eq. (4.57). The moments\nPn (\u03b6, t = 0) from Eq. (4.62) are plotted as a function of \u03b6 for n = 0, 1, 2, 3. Additionally\nX's denote the simple (n + 1)-point polynomial fit to the moment Pn .\n\nPolynomiality requires the moments Pn to be of the form\nPn (\u03b6, t) =\n\nn\nX\n\nanj (t) \u03b6 j .\n\n(4.63)\n\nj=0\n\nThe zeroth moment is merely the sum rule for the form factor, hence a00 (t) = F (t). For\nsimplicity, we check a few of the lowest moments for the polynomiality condition Eq. (4.63)\nat t = 0. In Figure 4.7, we plot the moments Pn (\u03b6, 0) for n = 0, 1, 2, 3 which appear as\nsmooth functions. Additionally we plot simple (n+1)-point polynomial fits to the moments,\nwhich line up nicely with the integrals (4.62).\n\n4.3.4\n\nDouble distribution\n\nTo construct the DD, we shall first proceed incorrectly by appealing to the Lorentz invariance of the form factor as in Section 4.2.1. This will at least lead to one component of the\nDD satisfying the reduction relations and can be compared to Eq. (4.57).\nUsing Eq. (4.58) in the \u2206+ = 0 (Drell-Yan) frame, we can write F (t) in the form (4.18)\nwith\n\u0010\n\u0011\n2\u03c0A \u03b8(1 \u2212 x \u2212 y) y(1 \u2212 x \u2212 y)\nF (x, y; t) = 3m2 \u2212M\u03c02 x(1\u2212x)+y(1\u2212x\u2212y)t\nh\ni3 .\n(1 \u2212 x) m2 \u2212 M\u03c02 x(1 \u2212 x) \u2212 y(1 \u2212 x \u2212 y)t\n(4.64)\nAside from factors arising from spin, this DD is basically the same as that considered [71]\nwhich one can realize by utilizing \u03bb2 = \u2212M\u03c02 /4 + m2 . Not surprisingly, then, this DD\nsatisfies Eqs. (4.19\u20134.21). For reference we give the quark distribution function\nh\ni\n2 3m2 \u2212 M 2 x(1 \u2212 x)\n(1\n\u2212\nx)\n\u03c0\n2\u03c0A\nq(x) =\n,\n(4.65)\n6\n[m2 \u2212 M\u03c02 x(1 \u2212 x)]3\nwhich could be calculated directly from \u03c8eff in Eq. (4.61).\nIn Figure 4.8, we plot the GPD Eq. (4.57) as well as the GPD derived from DD Eq. (4.64)\nvia Eq. (4.23). As in Section 4.2.1, the two are different despite the fact both models are\n64\n\n\f2\n\nH(x,\u03b6,t= -4m )\n\n0.6\n\n0.4\n\nLC\nDD-based\n\u03b4\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n-0.2\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\nx\n\n0.8 \u03b6\n\n0.6\n\n1\n\nFigure 4.8: Comparison of covariant GPDs for the spinor triangle diagram.

We also plot the difference between the\ntwo curves (\u03b4). The area under the curves is identically F (\u22124m2 ) for LC and DD-based\nGPDs, and hence zero for their difference \u03b4.\n1.04\n\nR(x,\u03b6=0.4)\n\nDD-based\nLight-cone\n1.02\n\n1\n\n0.98\n\n\u03b6\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\nx\n\n0.8\n\n0.9\n\n1\n\nFigure 4.9: Comparison of GPDs: GPD calculated from the DD Eq. (4.64) via Eq. (4.23)\n(DD-based) compared with the light-cone projection of the form factor Eq.(4.57) (Lightcone) for fixed \u03b6 = 0.4 at t = 0. Here we plot the ratio R(x, \u03b6) appearing in Eq. (4.67) as a\nfunction of x > \u03b6. Positivity constrains this ratio to be less than one.\n\ncovariant and posses the same form factor and quark distribution. Additionally we plot\ntheir difference as a function of x.\n\n4.3.5\n\nPositivity constraints\n\nHere we demonstrate another difference between the GPD in (4.57) and the one stemming\nfrom the one-component DD Eq. (4.64). To do so, we look at the positivity constraints.\nOriginally these constraints appeared in [70,101] and were derived from the positivity of the\ndensity matrix by restricting the final-state parton to have positive plus-momentum [and\nignoring the contribution from E(x, \u03b6, t) for the spin- 12 case]. Although the matrix elements\ninvolved for GPDs are off diagonal, they are still restricted by positivity and their diagonal\nelements. Correcting the constraints for the presence of the E-distribution was first done\nin [26]. By considering the positivity of the norm on Hilbert space, stricter constraints for\nthe spin- 12 distributions H and E have recently appeared as well as constraints for the full\nset of twist-two GPDs [102].\nFor the scalar pion case there is of course no contribution from the non-existent Edistribution and hence the original bounds are actually correct (modulo factors due to the\n65\n\n\fdifference of a spin- 21 proton versus a spin-0 pion). Given the matrix element definition of\nthe GPD consistent with equation (4.10), namely\nZ\n1\ndz \u2212 ixP + z \u2212\nH(x, \u03b6, t) =\nh\u03c0(P \u2032 )|\u03c8\u0304(0)\u03b3 + \u03c8(z \u2212 )|\u03c0(P )i,\n(4.66)\ne\n1 \u2212 \u03b6/2\n4\u03c0\nthe spin-0 positivity constraint (for x > \u03b6) reads\n\u0001 H(x, \u03b6, 0)\n\u2264 1,\nR(x, \u03b6) \u2261 1 \u2212 \u03b6/2 p\nq(x)q(x\u2032 )\n\n(4.67)\n\nwhere q(x) is the model distribution function in Eq. (4.65). Of course the above result\nholds for finite \u2212t, however since the function F decreases with \u2212t, Eq. (4.67) is the tightest\nconstraint. Notice for M\u03c02 6= 0, the limit t = 0 is in an unphysical region. If we treat this limit\nas formal, however, and analytically continue our expressions, we can use Eq. (4.67). Such\ncontinuation is consistent with the light-cone Fock space representation of GPDs [26, 27].\nGiven the constraint Eq. (4.67), we can test whether GPDs calculated from the lightcone projection (4.58) and DD (4.64) satisfy positivity. In Figure 4.9, we plot R(x, \u03b6) for\neach GPD as a function of x for the fixed value of \u03b6 = 0.4. There is noticeably different\nbehavior in the figure: positivity is violated by the DD-based model. As above (Section\n4.2.2), we must carefully derive contributions from the other component G(x, y; t).\n\n4.3.6\n\nDerivation of the correct DDs\n\nTo derive both F and G DDs for the spin- 12 pion model, we must consider the action of\n\u2194\n\n\u2194\n\nthe operator \u03b3 {\u03bc iD \u03bc1 * * * iD \u03bcn } between non-diagonal pion states. Inserted into Eq. (4.56)\nwhich is now taken in the symmetrical frame, this operator produces\n\u0003\n\u0002\nZ\n\u2206/2 + m)\u03b3 5 (/k + /\u2206 + m)\u03b3 {\u03bc (k + \u2206/2)\u03bc1 * * * (k + \u2206/2)\u03bcn }\nk + m)\u03b3 5 (/\nk \u2212 /P + /\n4 Tr (/\n.\nd k\n\u0002\n\u00032 \u0002\n\u00032 \u0002\n\u0003\nk2 \u2212 m2 + i\u01eb (k + \u2206)2 \u2212 m2 + i\u01eb (k \u2212 P\u0304 \u03bc + \u2206/2)2 \u2212 m2 + i\u01eb\n(4.68)\nThe presence of the trace\nh\ni\n\u2206\u03bc 2 2\nt\nTr[. . .]\u03bc = 4 P \u03bc (m2 \u2212k2 \u2212k*\u2206)+\n(m \u2212k +2k*P )+k\u03bc (m2 \u2212k2 \u2212 +2k*P \u2212k*\u2206) (4.69)\n2\n2\n\ncomplicates evaluating Eq. (4.68) by requiring contributions from diagrams reduced by one\npropagator. Since we have smeared the photon via (4.55), the reduced diagrams are finite.\nLet us denote the propagators simply by A = (k\u2212P +\u2206/2)2 \u2212m2 +i\u01eb, B = (k+\u2206)2 \u2212m2 +i\u01eb\nand C = k2 \u2212 m2 + i\u01eb. To correctly evaluate Eq. (4.68), we must write the trace as\nh\ni\n\u0001 \u2206\u03bc\n\u0001\nt 1\n1\nt\nt\nTr{. . .}\u03bc = 4 P \u03bc \u2212 (B + C) +\nM 2 \u2212 \u2212 A + (B \u2212 C) + k\u03bc (M 2 \u2212 \u2212 A) (4.70)\n2 2\n2\n4\n2\n2\n\nand evaluate each term separately canceling propagators in the denominator of Eq. (4.68).\nThese cancellations enable the DD to be read off by inspection.\nThese integrals can easily be evaluated using Feynman parameters. For example, let us\nconsider the non-reduced contribution from Eq. (4.70). The denominator of Eq. 4.68 appears\nas A B2 C2 and so we introduce two Feynman parameters {x, y} to render the denominator\nspecifically in the form [xA + yB + (1 \u2212 x \u2212 y)C]\u22125 . One then translates k\u03bc to render the\n66\n\n\fintegral (hyper-) spherically symmetric via the definition k\u03bc = l\u03bc + \u03b2P \u03bc \u2212 (\u03b1 + 1)\u2206\u03bc /2.\nHere \u03b2 = x and \u03b1 = x + 2y \u2212 1. Using a Wick rotation to evaluate the resulting integral\nover l, we can cast the contribution to Eq.

This need not be the case, however, for each intermediate step of the calculation,\ne.g. contributions from B-reduced terms and C-reduced terms are individually neither even\nnor odd in \u03b1 while their sum is even and difference is odd.\nIgnoring for the moment contributions from A-reduced terms, we arrive at the DDs\nh\ni\n(4.74)\nF (\u03b2, \u03b1; t) = \u03c0 A D(\u03b2, \u03b1; t)3 (1 \u2212 \u03b2)m2 \u2212 \u03b2\u03b12 M\u03c02 + (1 \u2212 \u03b2)[(1 \u2212 \u03b2)2 \u2212 \u03b12 ]t/4\nh\ni\n(4.75)\nG(\u03b2, \u03b1; t) = \u2212\u03c0 A \u03b1 D(\u03b2, \u03b1; t)3 m2 \u2212 M\u03c02 (1 \u2212 \u03b2 \u2212 \u03b12 ) + [(1 \u2212 \u03b2)2 \u2212 \u03b12 ]t/4 ,\n\nThe contribution from A-reduced terms has the form of a D-term in that it is proportional\nto \u03b4(\u03b2).

Accordingly F (x, y; t) is M\u00fcnchen\nsymmetric and G(x, y; t) is antisymmetric, while D(y; t) is antisymmetric about y = 1/2.\nNotice F (x, y; t) in Eq. (4.78) is not that of Eq. (4.64). Given the ambiguity inherent in\ndefining F versus G DDs [cf. Eq. (4.8)], there is no reason to believe the F s would be the\nsame. In principle, we could construct a quasi-gauge transformation [75] to render the F s\nthe same. This would enable identification of the missing G function unique to Section\n4.3.4. We shall not pursue this tangential point,5 but simply point out that the procedure\nin [71] leads only to one component of the DD and precisely which component [in the\ndecomposition of Eq.

Even in the\nabsence of the D-term, the contribution from G cannot be neglected in ascertaining the DD.\nAgain calculation of the GPD from the full two-component DD agrees with the light-cone\nGPD definition. The argument of Lorentz invariance used to calculate an F -type DD that\nsatisfies the reduction relations does not determine the GPD.\nFor a given model, there exists a unique two-component DD in the decomposition of\nEq. (4.1). This DD produces a GPD which is then consistent with the light-cone projection\nand satisfies all the necessary reduction relations. On the other hand, if one is interested in\nconstructing different GPD models satisfying the reduction relations, polynomiality, etc.,\nH(x, \u03b6, t) =\n\nZ\n\ndz\n\nZ\n\nh\ndy \u03b4(x\u2212z \u2212\u03b6y) F (x, y; t)+\n\n5\n\nNotice the contribution to the GPD from our D-term resembles that of Hinst in Eq. (4.59) but is not\nidentical. Both terms originate from a reduction of the spectator's propagator. In the case of the D-term, the\nspectator's propagator is completely removed by the A-reduction. For Hinst , there is residual x-dependence\nstemming from the light-cone instantaneous propagator \u03b3 + /2P + (1 \u2212 x).\n\n68\n\n\fone could exploit the ambiguity of one-component DDs. Consider the following. The\ncontribution to the GPD from F in Figure 4.10 is markedly different from Eq. (4.57) and\nthe analogous contribution from Eq. (4.64). These three GPDs, however, share the same\nform factor and quark distribution, since their respective G functions do not contribute to\nthe reduction relations. Thus one can always use DD-gauge freedom [75] to transform a\ngiven F into a new function and throw away contributions from G. The result is an infinite\nset of different GPDs with identical form factors and quark distributions. As pointed out\nin Section 4.3.5, one must be careful to maintain positivity although it is likely that there\nstill is an infinite set of GPDs which would.\n\n4.4\n\nSummary\n\nAbove we consider two covariant models for pions: one with scalar constituents and the\nother with spin- 12 . The spin- 21 model requires regularization and we choose the method\nin [99] in order to maintain positivity. For each case we derive the GPD from its matrix\nelement definition which forces us to consider the triangle diagram for the form factor with\nthe plus momentum of the struck quark kept fixed in a general \u2206+ 6= 0 frame.\nWe also construct the DDs for each model. The approach of [71] leads only to one\ncomponent of the DD (the \"forward-visible\" piece) which is itself ambiguous, thus resulting GPDs are incorrect and need not satisfy positivity. This fact remains true even for\nC-odd distributions. This means the reduction relations alone are not enough from which\nto calculate a model's DD (and hence GPD). To obtain both components of the DD unambiguously, we calculate the matrix elements of twist-two operators. The resulting DD-based\nGPDs then agree with those calculated on the light cone. The \"gauge freedom\" inherent\nin defining F vs. G DDs could be exploited, however, for phenomenological studies where\none is interested in a mathematical fit to data, rather than a calculation of a given model's\nDD. Having investigated the calculation of DDs for pions, we can now turn to the case of\nthe proton.\n\n69\n\n\fChapter 5\n\nDouble Distributions for the\nProton\nIn this Chapter, we extend the simple scenarios so far pursued to build a DD model for the\nproton. We treat the proton as a bound state of a residual quark and two quarks strongly\ncoupled in both the scalar and axial-vector diquark channels. The resulting light-cone\nwavefunction of the proton has appropriate spin structure: containing correlations where\nthe residual quark carries the spin of the proton as well as correlations where the quark and\ndiquark are in a relative p-wave. We use this model to derive DDs for the proton. Inclusion\nof the spin structure into double distributions is crucial if one wishes to make contact with\nthe spin sum rule for hadrons. While this (in essence two-body) model for the proton is\ncrude, model parameters can be tuned so that the electromagnetic form factors are fit at\nsmall momentum transfer. Quark distributions can be matched and resulting GPDs are\nsuitable for phenomenology.\nThis Chapter has the following organization. First we review our conventions for DDs\nfor spin- 12 particles and the relation of these DDs to GPDs in Section 5.1. In order to deal\nwith D-terms efficiently, we opt to calculate three DD functions. The ambiguity inherent\nin defining DDs for spin- 21 systems is detailed in Appendix H. Next in Section 5.2, we\npresent the quark-diquark model under consideration. DDs are calculated in this model\nin both the scalar and axial-vector diquark channels. Relevant identities are gathered in\nAppendix I, while the details of the derivation appear in Appendix K. Intuition about\nthe model and its construction is provided in Appendix J, where the effective light-cone\nwavefunction is extracted from projecting onto the light-cone. Section 5.3 presents potential\nphenomenological uses for the model. The model is tuned to reproduce the Dirac and Pauli\nform factors of the proton for small momentum transfer. Resulting quark distributions and\nGPDs are sensible at a low scale but do not contain the relevant non-perturbative small-x\nbehavior relevant for GPD phenomenology. One could then follow [71] and augment the\nDDs with empirically parametrized quark distributions and re-tune the model's parameters\nor use perturbative evolution. Consequently these simple model GPDs then satisfy all\nknown constraints, including positivity.\n\n5.1\n\nDefinitions\n\nTo begin, we set forth our conventions for DDs and their relation to GPDs. Moments of\nDDs appear naturally in the decomposition of twist-two operators' matrix elements that\n70\n\n\fare non-diagonal in momentum space; moreover, they provide an elegant explanation of the\npolynomiality property of GPDs. To make any progress in calculating DDs, we must use\nthe parton model simplification for the gauge covariant derivative: D \u03bc \u2192 \u2202 \u03bc .\nThe non-diagonal proton matrix elements of twist-two operators can be decomposed in\na fully Lorentz covariant fashion in terms of various twist-two form factors Ank (t), Bnk (t)\nand Cnk (t), namely1\n\u2194\n\n\u2194\n\nhP \u2032 , \u03bb\u2032 |\u03c8(0)\u03b3 {\u03bc iD \u03bc1 * * * iD \u03bcn } \u03c8(0)|P, \u03bbi\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\nn\nX\n\u2206 \u03bcn }\n\u2206 \u03bcn\u2212k+1\nn!\n\u2032 {\u03bc\n\u03bc1\n\u03bcn\u2212k\nAnk (t)P * * * P\n*** \u2212\n= u\u03bb\u2032 (P )\u03b3 u\u03bb (P )\n\u2212\nk!(n \u2212 k)!\n2\n2\nk=0\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\nn\n{\u03bc\u03bd \u2206\nX\n\u2206 \u03bcn\u2212k+1\nn!\n\u2206 \u03bcn }\n\u03bd\n\u2032 i\u03c3\n\u03bc1\n\u03bcn\u2212k\n+ u\u03bb\u2032 (P )\n\u2212\nu\u03bb (P )\nBnk (t)P * * * P\n*** \u2212\n2M\nk!(n \u2212 k)!\n2\n2\nk=0\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\nn\n{\u03bc\nX\n\u2206 \u03bcn\u2212k+1\nn!\n\u2206 \u03bcn }\n\u2032 \u2206\n\u03bc1\n\u03bcn\u2212k\n\u2212\nu\u03bb (P )\nCnk (t)P * * * P\n,\n*** \u2212\n\u2212 u\u03bb\u2032 (P )\n4M\nk!(n \u2212 k)!\n2\n2\nk=0\n\n(5.1)\n\nwhere the action of { * * * } on Lorentz indices produces the symmetric traceless part of the\ntensor and P is defined to be the average momentum between the initial and final states\nP \u03bc = 21 (P \u2032 + P )\u03bc and \u2206 is the momentum transfer, \u2206\u03bc = (P \u2032 \u2212 P )\u03bc . T -invariance restricts\nk in the first two sums to be even and odd in the last sum. There are three Dirac structures\nin the above decomposition since in general the twist-two currents are not conserved thus\nallowing for a structure proportional to \u2206\u03bc . The ambiguity of DDs for spin- 12 systems is\naddressed in Appendix H. Such difficulties in constructing DDs have been addressed in\nthe literature [73\u201376], and we find the construction in Eq. (5.1) the easiest to work with in\nactual calculations.\nThe above decomposition can be used to define three double distributions as generating\nfunctions for the twist-two form factors\nZ 1\u2212|\u03b2|\nZ 1\nd\u03b1 \u03b2 n\u2212k \u03b1k F (\u03b2, \u03b1; t)\n(5.2)\nd\u03b2\nAnk (t) =\n\u22121\n1\n\nBnk (t) =\n\nZ\n\nd\u03b2\n\n\u22121\n\nCnk (t) =\n\nZ\n\n1\n\n\u22121\n\nd\u03b2\n\nZ\nZ\n\n\u22121+|\u03b2|\n1\u2212|\u03b2|\n\nd\u03b1 \u03b2 n\u2212k \u03b1k K(\u03b2, \u03b1; t)\n\n(5.3)\n\nd\u03b1 \u03b2 n\u2212k \u03b1k G(\u03b2, \u03b1; t).\n\n(5.4)\n\n\u22121+|\u03b2|\n1\u2212|\u03b2|\n\n\u22121+|\u03b2|\n\nAs a consequence of the restriction on k in the sums, the functions F (\u03b2, \u03b1; t) and K(\u03b2, \u03b1; t)\nare even in \u03b1, while G(\u03b2, \u03b1; t) is odd. The F (\u03b2, \u03b1; t) and K(\u03b2, \u03b1; t) DDs are similar in\nform to the functions originally employed in [69]. The difference is due to the third DD,\nG(\u03b2, \u03b1; t), which incorporates the D-term [74] among other things.\nSumming up the moments in Eq. (5.1), these DD functions then appear in the decom1\n\nBeyond the parton model, this decomposition still holds. The twist-two form factors, however, acquire scale dependence due to the renormalization of the twist-two operators.

Due to the symmetry of the DDs with respect to \u03b1, the\nGPDs Hq (x, \u03be, t) and Eq (x, \u03be, t) are both even functions of the skewness parameter \u03be.\nThe GPD Hq (x, \u03be, t) has an important reduction property. Taking the diagonal limit of\nthe light-cone correlator Eq.

Higher x-moments of\nHq (x, \u03be, t) and Eq (x, \u03be, t) are even polynomials in \u03be as can be seen directly from Eqs. (5.8)\nand (5.9).\nThe GPDs satisfy further constraints: the positivity bounds [26, 70, 101\u2013105] . These\nbounds are particularly important for comparing with experiment. Model GPDs which\nreduce to the experimental quark distribution in Eq. (5.10) but violate the positivity bounds\nare not worth considering because one knows from the start that rate estimates predicted\nby the model GPDs are automatically wrong. Usually violation of the positivity bounds is a\nsignal that the model is inconsistent with the underlying field theory. Perhaps surprisingly\nviolation occurs frequently in more-or-less all standard hadronic models. Of interest to us\nare the basic bounds for both the spin-flip and non-flip amplitudes\ns \u0012\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\nx\u2212\u03be\nx+\u03be\n\u03bb,\u00b1\u03bb\nfq\n,\n(5.15)\n\u03b8(x \u2212 \u03be) Mq (x, \u03be, t) \u2264 fq\n1\u2212\u03be\n1+\u03be\nwhich we use as a stipulation in constructing our model.\nLastly we need to address the negative range of the DD variable \u03b2. Experimentally and\ndiagrammatically \u03b2 is strictly positive and crossing symmetry can be used to extend the\nrange to positive and negative \u03b2, or in our case reduce the range to strictly positive. To\nthis end, we define two functions for each DD\nFq\u00b1 (\u03b2, \u03b1; t) = Fq (\u03b2, \u03b1; t) \u00b1 Fq (\u03b2, \u03b1; t)\n\nKq\u00b1 (\u03b2, \u03b1; t)\nG\u00b1\nq (\u03b2, \u03b1; t)\n\n= Kq (\u03b2, \u03b1; t) \u00b1 Kq (\u03b2, \u03b1; t)\n\n= Gq (\u03b2, \u03b1; t) \u00b1 Gq (\u03b2, \u03b1; t),\n\n(5.16)\n(5.17)\n(5.18)\n\nwhere the antiquark contributions are defined by crossing\nFq (\u03b2, \u03b1; t) = \u2212Fq (\u2212\u03b2, \u03b1; t)\n\nKq (\u03b2, \u03b1; t) = \u2212Kq (\u2212\u03b2, \u03b1; t)\n\nGq (\u03b2, \u03b1; t) = \u2212Gq (\u2212\u03b2, \u03b1; t).\n\nThus the plus DDs [Fq+ (\u03b2, \u03b1; t), Kq+ (\u03b2, \u03b1; t), and G+\nq (\u03b2, \u03b1; t)] are odd functions of \u03b2 and\nthe minus DDs are even functions. In partonic language, the minus DDs correspond to a\ndifference in quark and antiquark DDs (the valence configuration) while the plus DDs are\na sum of quark and anitquark DDs.\nBy virtue of the above definitions Eqs. (5.16)\u2013(5.18), we can remove the explicit negative\u03b2 parts from DDs and consequently the GPDs. We do so by defining\nHq\u00b1 (x, \u03be, t) = Hq (x, \u03be, t) \u00b1 Hq (x, \u03be, t)\nEq\u00b1 (x, \u03be, t)\n\n= Eq (x, \u03be, t) \u00b1 Eq (x, \u03be, t),\n73\n\n(5.19)\n(5.20)\n\n\fwhere the antiquark contributions are defined by the crossing analogous to the DDs above.\nIn this form, we can rewrite the reduction relations in a more familiar way\nZ 1\u2212x\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\nd\u03b1 Fq\u00b1 (x, \u03b1; t),\n(5.21)\nfq (x) = Hq (x, 0, 0) =\n\u22121+x\n\nwhere fq\u2212 (x) is the valence quark distribution, namely fq\u2212 (x) = fq (x) \u2212 fq (x).

The\ndouble distribution variable \u03b2 as well as the momentum fraction x are positive below. The\nabove positivity bounds in Eq. (5.15) also hold for valence and plus amplitudes.\n\n5.2\n\nModel double distribution\n\nTo calculate DDs for the proton, as a first step we use only a simple model consisting of\ntwo quarks strongly coupled in the scalar and axial-vector diquark channels along with\na residual quark. This model can be considered as loosely based on relativistic quark\nmodels [106] or on the Nambu-Jona Lasinio model of the proton in the static approximation,\nsee, e.g., [107, 108]. We keep full Lorentz covariance in order to preserve the polynomiality\nof the moments Eq. (5.1). Without covariance, we would not even be able to deduce the\nDDs.\nIn order to further simplify this calculation, we mandate only tractable one loop contributions. To this end, we treat the scalar and axial-vector diquark T -matrices as free\nparticle propagators, namely of the forms\ni\n\u2212 m2SD + i\u03b5\n\u2212ig \u03bc\u03bd\nD \u03bc\u03bd (k) = 2\nk \u2212 m2AD + i\u03b5\nD(k) =\n\nk2\n\n(5.24)\n(5.25)\n\nrespectively. For simplicity we have neglected the term proportional to k\u03bc k\u03bd in the massive\nvector propagator. Evaluation of the contributions generated by this term are considerably\ncomplicated and will be the subject of a future publication.

For simplicity we choose\nthe quark-diquark vertex functions to be point-like, namely\n\u0393(s) = 11 \u2297 11\n\n(a)\n\u0393\u03bd,i\n\n= \u03b35 \u03b3\u03bd \u2297 \u03c4i .\n\n(5.29)\n(5.30)\n\nThis choice corresponds to modeling only a subset of the possible structures for the proton\nwavefunction, see [109, 110] for a complete discussion. The vertex function also contains\nan overall color anti-symmetrization which we suppress throughout. The conjugate vertex\n\u0393(k, P ) = C \u0393(\u2212k, \u2212P )T C \u2020 . One could modify the point-like vertex with a form factor as\nis commonly done, however, this generally violates the positivity bounds.\nIn this model, the axial diquark channel does not contribute to the proton's electromagnetic form factors. Thus we can only determine the parameters m and mSD by fits to the\nDirac and Pauli form factors. The parameter mAD could be tuned by fitting the quark distributions at some scale, however, we shall pursue a simpler course and set mSD = mAD = mD .\nAlternately mAD could be tuned from neutron form factor data.\nTo derive the F (\u03b2, \u03b1; t), K(\u03b2, \u03b1; t) and G(\u03b2, \u03b1; t) DDs, we consider the action of the\ntwist-two operator O\u03bc\u03bc1 ...\u03bcn between non-diagonal proton states. Working in the impulse\napproximation (see Figure 5.1), we have the contribution in the scalar diquark channel, for\nexample,\nZ\nu\u03bb\u2032 (P \u2032 )(/k + /\u2206 + m)\u0393\u03bc\u03bc1 ...\u03bcn (/k + m)u\u03bb (P )\n,\n(5.31)\nd4 k 2\n[k \u2212 m2 + i\u03b5]a [(k + \u2206)2 \u2212 m2 + i\u03b5]a [(k \u2212 P + \u2206/2)2 \u2212 m2D + i\u03b5]\nwhere we have chosen an analytic regularization (so that a > 1) respecting the positivity\nbounds.2 Since the NJL model is non-renormalizable, the choice of scheme is incorporated\n2\n\nAlternate schemes using Pauli-Villars subtractions often regulate such models and are also attractive\nfrom the perspective of DDs since Lorentz covariance is maintained. These subtractions, however, generally\nviolate the bounds in Eq. (5.15). For example, in the NJL model of the pion with two subtractions [79], the\npositivity bounds, which were ignored by the authors, are violated for small values of \u2212t. For the case of\na quark-diquark model regularized via Pauli-Villars subtractions, the violations are more severe and persist\nfor all values of \u2212t due to the mismatch of end-point and crossover behavior. This commonly encountered\nproblem is discussed in [63]. For these reasons, we have used the analytic regularization above, which we\nalso employed previously for the pion [73] in Chapter 4.\n\n75\n\n\finto the dynamics and hence the choice of regularization should maintain desired properties.\nFor phenomenological estimates of GPDs, the positivity bounds are of crucial importance,\nand our regularization choice respects these bounds, see Appendix J for details. One can\nview the regularization a > 1 as mimicking the non-local, non-perturbative structure of the\ntwist-two, quark-antiquark vertex. This choice of smearing maintains current conservation\nbut does not respect the Ward-Takahashi identity. Thus the normalization of amplitudes in\nEq. (5.26) is only approximately preserved. To remedy this feature, we add an a-dependent\nprefactor to the axial diquark contribution. This factor is then adjusted so that Nd = 1\nand consequently the u-quark distribution is correctly normalized, Nu = 2. An additional\ndrawback of the regularization scheme is that the induced quark form factors do not become\npoint-like for large momenta. While this is inconsistent with asymptotic freedom, the model\nis meant only for use in the low momentum transfer region because the diquark substructure\ncannot be resolved.\nThe symmetric, traceless tensor \u0393 in Eq. (5.31) is\n\u0393\u03bc\u03bc1 ...\u03bcn = \u03b3 {\u03bc (k + \u2206/2)\u03bc1 * * * (k + \u2206/2)\u03bcn }\n\n(5.32)\n\nThe involved numerator structure complicates calculation of the symmetric traceless part\nof the tensor, however, this can be calculated directly without recourse to explicitly writing\nout such tensors of rank n. See Appendix K. In order to compactly write out the DDs, we\ndefine the auxiliary functions\nDo (\u03b2, \u03b1; t) = \u03b2m2D + (1 \u2212 \u03b2)m2 \u2212 \u03b2(1 \u2212 \u03b2)M 2 + [(1 \u2212 \u03b2)2 \u2212 \u03b12 ]t/4,\n\n(5.33)\n\nwhich is the typical energy denominator in both channels and\nD(\u03b2, \u03b1; t) = 3N\n\n\u0003a\u22121\n\u0393(2a \u2212 1) \u0002\n(1 \u2212 \u03b2)2 \u2212 \u03b12\nDo (\u03b2, \u03b1; t)1\u22122a ,\na\u22121\n2\n2(4) \u0393(a)\n\nwhich is the typical prefactor for all DDs in this model.\nCalculation of DDs for the scalar diquark yields\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb (s)\n\uf8eb\n\u0002\n\u0003\nFq (\u03b2, \u03b1; t)\n(m + \u03b2M )2 + (1 \u2212 \u03b2)2 \u2212 \u03b12 4t +\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec (s)\n\uf8edKq (\u03b2, \u03b1; t)\uf8f8 = \u03b4q,u D(\u03b2, \u03b1; t) \uf8ed\n2M (1 \u2212 \u03b2)(m + \u03b2M )\n(s)\n4M \u03b1(m + \u03b2M )\nGq (\u03b2, \u03b1; t)\n\n(5.34)\n\nDo (\u03b2,\u03b1;t) \uf8f6\n2a\u22122\n\n\uf8f8.\n\n(5.35)\n\nIn the axial-vector diquark channel, we find\n\n\uf8f6\n(a)\nFq (\u03b2, \u03b1; t)\n\uf8f7 2\n\uf8ec (a)\n\uf8edKq (\u03b2, \u03b1; t)\uf8f8 = Z(a)(2\u03b4q,d + \u03b4q,u )D(\u03b2, \u03b1; t)\n9\n(a)\nGq (\u03b2, \u03b1; t)\n\uf8eb\n\u0002\n\u0003\n(2m + \u03b2M )2 \u2212 3m2 \u2212 (1 + \u03b2)2 \u2212 \u03b12 4t +\n\u00d7\uf8ed\n2M \u03b2[2m \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03b2)M ]\n\u22124M \u03b1(2m + \u03b2M )\n\uf8eb\n\nDo (\u03b2,\u03b1;t) \uf8f6\n2a\u22122\n\n\uf8f8 , (5.36)\n\nwhere Z(a) is the regularization dependent factor akin to wavefunction renormalization.

This is particularly simple, since\nthe axial diquark contribution cancels out of the the proton form factor. We choose to\nfit to the charge radius and magnetic moment and the experimental values we use are\n2 >= (0.870 fm)2 and \u03bc = 2.79 \u03bc . For the electromagnetic form factors of the\n< rE\np\nN\nproton, there is high precision data from JLAB [111, 112] and a recent global analysis and\nparametrization of [113]. The Sachs form factors are known experimentally to about 2%\naccuracy in the small momentum transfer regime and are given by\nt\nF2 (t)\n4M 2\nGM (t) = F1 (t) + F2 (t).\nGE (t) = F1 (t) +\n\n(5.37)\n(5.38)\n\nWe treat the regulator parameter a rather unconventionally; we use it as a means to\nexplore different covariant forms for the wavefunction. For a = 2, magnetic moment and\ncharge radius are reproduced . 0.1% for m = 0.437 GeV and mD = 0.726 GeV. The Sachs\nelectric and magnetic form factors match up . 5% for \u2212t . 0.2 GeV2 . For a = 3, magnetic\nmoment and charge radius are reproduced . 0.1% for m = 0.565 GeV and mD = 0.825 GeV.\nFor these parameters, the Sachs electric and magnetic form factors also match up . 5%\nfor \u2212t . 0.2 GeV2 . In the figures, we compare the phenomenological form factor fits to the\ntwo parameterizations of [113]. The fits for GE (t) and GM (t) are plotted in Fig. 5.2. As is\nstandard, we plot ratios of electric and magnetic form factors to the empirical dipole form\nfactor, namely\n\u0012\n\u0013\nt \u22122\nGD (t) = 1 \u2212 2\n,\n(5.39)\nMD\n2 = 0.71 GeV2 .\nwhere the dipole mass squared is MD\nWe can also determine the u and d quark distributions in our model. Since we do not\nhave antiquarks, the plus and minus distributions are identical fq\u00b1 (x) = fq (x). In Fig. 5.3,\n\n77\n\n\f6\n\nu: a=2\nu: a=3\nd: a=2\nd: a=3\n\n5\n\nfq(x)\n\n4\n3\n2\n1\n0\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\nx\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nFigure 5.3: Quark distributions for the proton model. The u- and d-quark distributions are\nplotted as a function of x for the a = 2 and a = 3 fits to the form factors.\n\nwe plot the u and d quark distributions as a function of x for the a = 2 and a = 3 fits. The\ndistributions are properly normalized so that Nu = 2 and Nd = 1. As commented above\nthis normalization requires a relative a-dependent factor for the axial-diquark contributions.\nAgain this is required because the regularization scheme we choose does not preserve the\nWard-Takahashi identity. Without the extra factor, the violation is \u223c 5\u201310%. Notice the\ndistributions do not vanish at the end-point x = 0. This is typical of NJL type calculations.\nThe kernel is independent of momentum and hence the wavefunction should be non-zero\nat both end-points. The fact that the distributions vanish at x = 1 is due to our choice of\nregularization. Physically it is thus reasonable to think of the regularization as mimicking\ncontributions from higher Fock states. Moreover, the model's scale is a-dependent, cf Figure\n5.3.\nAdditionally in Figs. 5.4 and 5.5, we have plotted the H \u00b1 (x, \u03be, t) and E \u00b1 (x, \u03be, t)\nGPDs. The figures show the GPDs at fixed \u2212t = 0.1 GeV2 for a few values of \u03be. The GPDs\nplotted are for the a = 2 fit; the distributions are qualitatively similar for the a = 3 model\nparameters.\nThe distributions plotted in Figs. 5.3\u20135.5 are presumably at some low hadronic scale\nintrinsic to the model. One way to determine the scales of the a = 2 and a = 3 models is\nto use the evolution equations to evolve empirical parameterizations down to a scale where\nthe first few moments of our model distributions agree. This procedure is not unique: many\nmodels can reproduce the empirical quark distributions at higher scales. Also the use of\nperturbative evolution is questionable at low scales. While the evolution kernels for GPDs\nare known at next-to-leading order [114\u2013118], perturbative evolution cannot generate the\nnon-perturbative small-x physics which our model lacks and the small-x physics is crucial\nfor relating to DVCS data. The the leading-twist DVCS amplitude is a convolution of GPDs\nwith a hard scattering kernel that emphasizes regions where the final-state wavefunction\nis evaluated near the end-point. In fact, the imaginary part of the amplitude is directly\nproportional to an overlap of light-cone wavefunctions, where the final state is at zero x.\nAn attractive alternative to using perturbative evolution to define the scale of the model\nis to implant a realistic quark distribution at some scale \u03bc via factorization of the DD [71].\nWith a proper choice of scale, perturbative evolution can then be used from \u03bc up to the\nexperimental scale. This seems necessary for the parametrization to be most useful for\nexperimental comparison. Ultimately the experiment must guide phenomenology in constructing parameterizations that are general enough to account for the observed correlations\n78\n\n\f5\n\n\u03be=0.05\n\u03be=0.10\n\u03be=0.20\n\n3\n\n-\n\n2\n\n-\n\n\u03be=0.05\n\u03be=0.10\n\u03be=0.20\n\n2\n\nH d(x,\u03be,t)\n\nH u(x,\u03be,t)\n\n4\n\n1\n\n1\n\n-0.5\n\n0\n\nx\n\n0\n-1\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n4\n\n2\n\n2\n\n1\n\nH d(x,\u03be,t)\n\nH u(x,\u03be,t)\n\n0\n-1\n\n\u03be=0.05\n\u03be=0.10\n\u03be=0.20\n\n-2\n-4\n-1\n\n-0.5\n\n0\n\nx\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n\u03be=0.05\n\u03be=0.10\n\u03be=0.20\n\n-1\n\n-2\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\nx\n\n+\n\n+\n\n0\n\n-0.5\n\n-1\n\n-0.5\n\n0\n\nx\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\nFigure 5.4: GPDs for the proton model.

While the DD certainly does not factorize, the Ansatz in [71] avoids\nfactorizing the variable dependence of the GPDs. Further phenomenological consideration\nof this quark-diquark model is currently underway and will be presented elsewhere.\n\n80\n\n\fChapter 6\n\nConclusions\nAbove we have presented a comprehensive but more-or-less pedagogical treatment of modeling GPDs. In the course of attempting to model these distributions, we came across\nsubtle issues about the light-front BSE and its reduction scheme. Bent on applications to\nGPDs, we reviewed our work concerning current in the reduction formalism in Chapter 2.\nThere we proved a replacement theorem for apparent non-wavefunction type contributions.\nThe resolution of this issue was crucial to enable proper calculation of GPDs in light-front\nperturbation theory.\nIn Chapter 3 we detailed our calculation of GPDs in the light-front Wick-Cutkosky\nmodel. This calculation provided a non-trivial example of the light-cone Fock space representation of DVCS, in which form the GPDs' positivity bounds are manifest. The nonvanishing of GPDs at the crossover between kinematic regions was tied to higher Fock\ncomponents. Furthermore we saw how the features of light-cone time-ordered perturbation\ntheory entail the continuity of GPDs. Continuity of GPDs ensures the QCD factorization\ntheorem for DVCS. The proton case is likely to proceed along the lines outlined for the\nWick-Cutkosky model, however, incorporation of spin degrees of freedom is difficult due to\ndivergences.\nNext in Chapter 4, we considered an alternate approach to GPDs based on covariant\nDDs. This approach allowed us considerable insight as to the Lorentz covariance properties\nrequired of GPDs. Unfortunately in this formalism the positivity bounds are not transparent\nbut can be used as a guide in model building or calculation of DDs. Using simple models,\nwe not only compared covariant and light-front calculations of GPDs, we also corrected the\ninconsistencies of the method proposed in [71] for the calculation of DDs. Understanding\nthe DD formalism is pertinent because ad hoc forms for DDs are almost exclusively used to\nmodel GPDs. We have provided complete calculations of DDs for several models of scalar\nbound states. Such calculations fill a void in the literature.\nFinally in Chapter 5, we used a simple two-body model to calculate DDs for the proton.\nThis is the first such study. The model consists of two quarks strongly coupled in the scalar\nand axial diquark channels along with a residual quark. The simplicity of such a model\nallows for analytic computation of the DD functions which contain appropriate spin structure. The simplicity also allows for us to make contact with the light-cone wavefunctions\nand the equivalent overlap representation of GPDs. This toy model study thus enables a\ncomparison between the physical intuition of the light-cone Fock space representation of\nGPDs and the manifestly Lorentz invariant decomposition of DD functions.\nWe were careful to choose a regularization scheme that satisfies both Lorentz invariance\n\n81\n\n\fas well as the positivity bounds required of GPDs. Our model, although toy-like in nature,\ncan be used to match the electromagnetic form factors of the proton and can either be\naugmented with realistic valence quark distributions or be evolved to higher scales.\nThe scope of our investigation is two fold. One direction is to calculate as many DDs\nin simple scenarios as possible. This will give modelers a better sense of the form and\nbehavior of DDs and may assist with empirical parameterizations of GPDs. In another\nnearly orthogonal direction, one can improve upon the proton model used here in order to\nsee how various features of a realistic proton wavefunction manifest themselves in processes\nlike DVCS. Further extension of the model presented in Chapter 5 and its application to\nfuture data are under investigation.\n\n82\n\n\fBibliography\n[1] P. A. M. Dirac, Forms of relativistic dynamics, Rev.

Notice in our conventions g\u03bc\u03bd = g\u03bc\u03bd . For convenience we\nshall also refer to transverse two-vectors, namely a\u22a5 = (a1 , a2 ).

Here we give a more theoretical description of the\ndifferences between the two forms and thereby define what it means to specify a form of\ndynamics.\nA relativistic system is characterized by the ten operators of the Poincar\u00e9 group. Full\nrelativistic invariance stems from the algebra formed from the Poincar\u00e9 generators. The\ngenerators of the Poincar\u00e9 group consist of the four momenta P \u03bc , and the six operators\nembedded in the antisymmetric tensor M \u03bc\u03bd . The latter are the angular momenta, specified\nby\n1\n(B.1)\nLi = \u01ebijk M jk ;\n2\nand the Lorentz boosts, specified by\nK i = M 0i ,\n\n(B.2)\n\nwhere the indices i, j, and k run from 1 to 3.\nThese ten generators satisfy the Poincar\u00e9 algebra, namely\ni[P \u03bc , P \u03bd ] = 0,\ni[M\ni[M\n\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\n(B.3)\n\n\u03c1\n\n\u03bd\u03c1\n\n\u03bc\n\n\u03c1,\u03c3\n\n\u03bc\u03c3\n\n\u03bc\u03c1\n\n\u03bd\n\n,P ] = g P \u2212 g P ,\n\n,M\n\n] = g\n\nM\n\n\u03bd\u03c1\n\n\u03bc\u03c1\n\n\u2212g M\n\n(B.4)\n\u03bd\u03c3\n\n\u03bd\u03c3\n\n\u2212g M\n\n\u03bc\u03c1\n\n\u03bd\u03c1\n\n+g M\n\n\u03bc\u03c3\n\n.\n\n(B.5)\n\nThis algebra enforces that the P \u03bc are independent and transform as a four-vector under\nthe Lorentz transformation, while M \u03bc\u03bd must transform as an antisymmetric tensor. To\nfind a representation of the Poincar\u00e9 algebra, one constructs the generators from dynamical\nvariables: positions, momenta, spins, etc.\nTo make our discussion concrete, we restrict our attention to the case of a single free\nscalar particle. The dynamical variables at our disposal are the position and momentum\nfour-vectors x\u03bc and p\u03bc that obey the quantum mechanical commutator\ni[x\u03bc , p\u03bc ] = g \u03bc\u03bd .\n\n(B.6)\n\nThis commutation relation will furnish a representation of the Poincar\u00e9 algebra provided\nthat we construct the generators as\nP \u03bc = p\u03bc\nM\n\n\u03bc\u03bd\n\n\u03bc \u03bd\n\n(B.7)\n\u03bd \u03bc\n\n=x p \u2212x p .\n94\n\n(B.8)\n\n\fWe also must impose the relativistic constraint p2 = m2 to have Lorentz covariance.\nIn order to specify the form of dynamics of the system, one needs to create a foliation of\nspace-time into space and time. This is done by choosing the initial surface \u03a3 on which the\ngeneral time variable \u03c4 is zero. Choices for \u03a3 are restricted by the condition that all possible\nworld lines may intersect \u03a3 exactly once. Clearly this is true also in classical mechanics\nwhere Galilean time t is completely uncoupled from three-dimensional Euclidean space and\nthus the instant t = 0 specifies a unique point on the space-time trajectory of all particles.\nAs we know from relativity, the world lines of particles are restricted to lie on or within\nthe fore and aft light cones. Because relativity restricts the class of possible world lines, it\nenlarges the possible initial surfaces \u03a3 and hence broadens our ability to define \"time\" in\nrelativistic dynamics.\nOnce we have specified the initial surface \u03a3, we have also to construct the normal N \u03bc .\nThe significance of the normal is that N * P serves as the Hamiltonian in the sense that\nit evolves the system away from the initial surface on parallel slices in \u03c4 . Thus in close\nanalogy with non-relativistic quantum mechanics, the Hamiltonian is dynamical.\nNow having specified the dynamics of the system, we imagine the initial conditions\n(wavefunctions, etc) are defined on the initial surface \u03a3. The Poincar\u00e9 generators now\nfall into two categories: kinematical operators and dynamical operators. The kinematical\noperators have the property of mapping \u03a3 \u2192 \u03a3. They are called kinematical because the\nbehavior of states under these operators does not require dynamical input since \u03c4 remains\nzero. On the other hand, operators that do not act transitively on \u03a3 are dynamical, i.e.,\nthe effects of these operators on states require knowledge of the system away from \u03a3.\nTo give a familiar example of a form of dynamics, we consider first the instant form.\nThe initial surface is specified by the conventional instant of time \u03a3 : x0 = 0. The conjugate\nto time is the energy\np\n(B.9)\np0 = N * p = p2 + m2 .\nTo find out which operators are kinematical and dynamical under this foliation, we use the\nrepresentation in Eq. (B.7) evaluated on the surface \u03a3. The Hamiltonian, which for the\ninstant form is P 0 = p0 , is automatically dynamical in any system. Its appearance in the\nother Poincar\u00e9 generators indicates that they too are dynamical. Thus we find six kinematic\noperators\nP i = pi\nM\n\nij\n\ni\n\n(B.10)\nj\n\nj\n\n=x P \u2212x P\n\ni\n\n(B.11)\n\nand additionally three dynamical ones\nM i0 = xi P 0 .\n\n(B.12)\n\nThis situation of instant form dynamics could be anticipated directly from special relativity.\nWe know that spatial translations and rotations leave the surface x0 = 0 unchanged. Hence\nthe generators of these transformations must be kinematical. On the other hand, boosts in\nany direction mix the coordinate of that direction with x0 , hence dynamics are required in\norder to get the system off the surface \u03a3.\nAnother example of a form of dynamics is the front form. In this form, the initial surface\nis specified by a plane tangential to the light-cone \u03a3 : x+ = 0, see Figure B.1. The normal\nto this surface is given by the lightlike vector\n1\nN \u03bc = \u221a (1, 0, 0, \u22121)\n2\n95\n\n(B.13)\n\n\fx\n\n0\n\nx\n\n3\n\n1\n\nx , x2\n\n+\n\u03a3: x =0\n\nFigure B.1: The hypersurface \u03a3 : x+ = 0 that defines the front form of dynamics. The\nsurface \u03a3 is the plane tangential to the light-cone, x2 = 0. Figure adapted from [129]\nand hence the Hamiltonian is given by\nN * P = P \u2212 = p\u2212 .\n\n(B.14)\n\nThe kinematic operators in the front form are the transverse and longitudinal momenta\nP \u22a5 = p\u22a5 ,\n\nP + = p+ ,\n\n(B.15)\n\nan angular momentum\nand the light-front boosts\n\nM 12 = x1 P 2 \u2212 x2 P 1 ,\nM +\u22a5 = \u2212x\u22a5 P + ,\n\nM +\u2212 = x\u2212 P + .\n\n(B.16)\n(B.17)\n\nThere are thus only two additional dynamical operators given by\nM \u2212\u22a5 = x\u2212 P \u22a5 \u2212 xi P \u2212 .\n\n(B.18)\n\nThe physics of the partition into kinematic and dynamic classes of generators is clear.\nThe two dynamical operators involve rotations about x1 and x2 axes. These rotations\nchange \u03a3 and hence require dynamics. There are three independent translations that leave\nthe surface x+ = 0 alone and hence the three kinematical operators P \u22a5 and P + . Rotations\nwithin the surface \u03a3 that leave x+ = 0 unchanged are generated by the angular momentum\nM 12 . There are two special combinations of rotations and boosts (from the instant form\nmindset) that make up the kinematical light-front boosts M +\u22a5 . Finally there is the third\nkinematical boost M \u2212+ = \u2212K 3 that is identical (up to sign) to the instant form boost in\nthe x3 direction. Under such a boost of rapidity \u03b7 the coordinates get mapped as follows\n\uf8eb 0\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb 0\uf8f6\nx cosh \u03b7 + x3 sinh \u03b7\nx\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\n\uf8ec x1 \uf8f7\nx1\n\uf8f7.\n\uf8ec \uf8f7 \u2212\u2192 \uf8ec\n(B.19)\n2\n2\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\n\uf8edx \uf8f8\nx\nx3 sinh \u03b7 + x0 cosh \u03b7\nx3\n96\n\n\fThus the light-cone time x+ \u2192 e\u03b7 x+ is merely rescaled under this boost. The dynamics are\ndiagonal with respect to K 3 boosts. Notice, consequently, the initial surface \u03a3 is indeed\ninvariant under the action of M \u2212+ since x+ = 0 on \u03a3.\nOf course our discussion of the forms of dynamics above was limited to the case of a free\nscalar particle. Inclusion of dynamics leads to interaction terms in the Poincar\u00e9 generators.\nFinding such terms that are still consistent with the Poincar\u00e9 algebra is the real struggle\nof constructing a relativistic dynamical system [1]. Indeed Poincar\u00e9 invariance alone is\nnot enough to guarantee relativistic covariance. Despite this, a few special cases that do\nmaintain full relativistic covariance have been arduously worked out, see e.g. [2]. This issue\nat play here is how to impose relativistic covariance on quantum mechanical, fixed particle\nnumber systems with interaction potentials. At heart these two are incompatible: action\nat a distance and particle conservation have stepped aside in favor relativistic field theory.\nNonetheless, the discussion in this Appendix motivates the use of front form dynamics and\nthe light-cone quantization of field theories.\n\n97\n\n\fAppendix C\n\nLight-Cone Quantization\nIn Section 1.1, we derived an expression for the DIS structure function f1 (x). Here we\nelucidate the physics of this distribution function using light-cone quantization in the lightcone gauge. For reference the leading-twist function f1 (x) encountered in DIS is defined as\nZ\nd\u03bb i\u03bbx\n1\ne hP |\u03c8(0)\u03b3 + \u03c8(\u03bbn)|P i.\nf1 (x) =\n(C.1)\n2\n2\u03c0\n\nNotice that the correlator\n\u221a is not an equal-time Green's function since the quark field is\nannihilated at x0 = \u03bb/ 2\u039b and created at x0 = 0. During this time, fluctuations of the\nresidual proton state occur that deny the matrix element a probabilistic interpretation. On\nthe other hand, both quark fields are evaluated at x+ = 0 which tells us the function f1 (x)\nis an equal light-cone time correlator. To see the density interpretation of f1 (x) and hence\njustify the name PDF, we must accordingly use light-cone quantization.\nOn the light cone, spinor fields have components that are dynamically constrained. To\nseparate out the dependent fields we write\n\u03c8 = \u03c8+ + \u03c8\u2212 ,\n\n(C.2)\n\nwhere \u03c8+ is the good component of the spinor field, and \u03c8\u2212 is the bad component that is\ndynamically determined from the QCD equations of motion. Explicitly the good and bad\ncomponents are defined from the projectors (given in Appendix A), namely\n\u03c8\u00b1 = \u039b\u00b1 \u03c8.\n\n(C.3)\n\nThe dynamically independent good fields \u03c8+ are then quantized at equal light-cone time\nn\no\n\u2020\n\u03c8+\u03b1\n(x), \u03c8+\u03b2 (y)\n\nx+ =y +\n\n1\n= \u221a (\u039b+ )\u03b1\u03b2 \u03b4(x\u2212 \u2212 y \u2212 )\u03b4(x\u22a5 \u2212 y\u22a5 ),\n2\n\n(C.4)\n\nwith all other possible anticommutators (among the good fields) vanishing. This anticommutation relation is naturally solved by a Fourier decomposition in terms of plane-wave\nmodes\nZ\nXh\n\u2212 +\n\u22a5 \u22a5\ndk+ dk\u22a5\n+\n\u2212 \u22a5\n\u03b8(k\n)\nb\u03bb (k+ , k\u22a5 )u+\u03bb (k)e\u2212i(x k \u2212x *k )\n\u03c8+ (x , x ) =\n2k+ (2\u03c0)3\n\u03bb=\u00b1\ni\n\u2020\n+\n\u22a5\ni(x\u2212 k + \u2212x\u22a5 *k\u22a5 )\n. (C.5)\n+ d\u03bb (k , k )v+\u03bb (k)e\n98\n\n\fThe above plane-wave decomposition is merely a projection of the four-dimensional solutions\nto the Dirac equation onto the hypersurface x+ = 0. The spinors in the above decomposition\nare good projections of the light-cone spinors in Appendix J, namely u+\u03bb (k) = \u039b+ u\u03bb (k)\nand similarly for v+\u03bb (k).\nThe quark mode operators b and b\u2020 must satisfy the anticommutation relation\nn\no\n\u22a5\n\u22a5\nb\u2020\u03bb (k+ , k\u22a5 ), b\u03bb\u2032 (k\u2032+ , k\u2032 ) = 2k+ \u03b4\u03bb,\u03bb\u2032 \u03b4(k+ \u2212 k\u2032+ )\u03b4(k\u22a5 \u2212 k\u2032 ),\n(C.6)\n\nand analogous relations hold for the antiquark creation and annihilation operators d\u2020 and\nd. Anticommutators between all remaining pairs of quark and antiquark mode operators\nvanish.\nUsing the relations in Appendix A, we can convert the bilocal operator in Eq. (1.19) to\na more useful form in terms of good fields\n\u221a \u2020\n\u03c8(0)\u03b3 + \u03c8(\u03bbn) = 2\u03c8+\n(0)\u03c8+ (\u03bbn).\n(C.7)\nThus inserting the mode expansion Eq. (C.5) for the fields above we arrive at\n(\nZ\n\u2020\n1 X\ndk\u22a5 hP |b\u03bb (xP + , k\u22a5 )b\u03bb (xP + , k\u22a5 )|P i, 0 < x < 1\nf1 (x) =\n4\u03c0x\n(2\u03c0)2 hP |d\u2020\u03bb (xP + , k\u22a5 )d\u03bb (xP + , k\u22a5 )|P i, \u22121 < x < 0\n\u03bb\n\n.\n\n(C.8)\n\nThe above expressions show that f1 (x) is determined from quark and antiquark density\noperators and hence has a probabilistic interpretation as the name PDF suggests. One can\ngo further and expand the proton state in the light-cone Fock basis to generate contributions\nto the PDF in the form of an infinite sum of squares of light-cone Fock state wavefunctions.\nWe can attempt the same procedure for the higher-twist structure function f4 (x) defined\nimplicitly through Eq. (1.18)\nZ\nd\u03bb i\u03bbx\n1\n(C.9)\ne hP |\u03c8(0)\u03b3 \u2212 \u03c8(\u03bbn)|P i.\nf4 (x) =\n2\n2\u03c0\nThe quark bilinear operator, however, only has bad components of the spinor field\n\u221a \u2020\n\u03c8(0)\u03b3 \u2212 \u03c8(\u03bbn) = 2\u03c8\u2212\n(0)\u03c8\u2212 (\u03bbn).\n(C.10)\nThese components are dynamically determined from the equations of motion for the \u03c8+\nfield, namely\n\u2202\n1\ni \u03c8\u2212 (\u03bbn) = \u03b3 + (\u2212i/D\u22a5 )\u03c8+ (\u03bbn).\n(C.11)\n\u2202\u03bb\n2\nClearly there is no partonic density interpretation for the f4 (x) structure function. The\npartial derivative term is kinematically of higher twist. The gluonic part of the covariant\nderivative leads to dynamical effects. Intermediate state gluons generally lead to more\npropagators compared to the kinematic terms and usually more suppression.\nA final point with respect to intermediate gluons must be made. One can imagine\nincluding longitudinal gluon scattering into the handbag diagram depicted in Figure 1.3.\nInclusion of these extra propagators does not necessarily lead to power-law suppression since\nlarge momentum flow can still be accommodated exclusively in the handle of the bag. These\nmultiple gluon exchanges can thus be of the same order as the leading twist contribution.\nSummed to all orders these longitudinal gluon scatterings produce the gauge link\n\u0011\n\u0010\nR0\n\u2032\n(C.12)\n\u03c8(0)\u03c8(\u03bbn) \u2192 \u03c8(0)P e\u2212ig \u03bb n*Ad\u03bb \u03c8(\u03bbn)\n99\n\n\f\u03be\u2212 x\n\n\u2212\u03be\u2212 x\n\n\u22121\n\n\u03be\u2212 x\n\nx +\u03be\n\n\u2212\u03be\n\n0\n\nx+\u03be\n\nx\u2212\u03be\n\n\u03be\n\n1\nx\n\nFigure C.1: Diagrammatic depiction of the kinematic regions contributing to the GPDs.\nFigure adapted from [12].\nwhich is necessary for the combination of bilocal fields to be gauge invariant in non-Abelian\nfield theory. Above we have tacitly assumed light-cone gauge, n*A = 0, in which longitudinal\ngluon scattering is a gauge artifact. There is more subtlety in this choice than we have\npresented here [120, 121].\nIn summary we have seen the leading-twist PDF f1 (x) describes the density of partons\nin the infinite momentum frame and in light-cone gauge. One can go further and ask for\nthe decomposition of GPDs in terms of the infinite momentum frame partons in light-cone\ngauge.

The same interpretation\nis true for anitquarks in the region x < \u2212\u03be. When \u2212\u03be < x < \u03be, one has the amplitude\nfor removing a quark-antiquark pair from the initial state. Notice as \u03be \u2192 0, one recovers\na density of partons with momentum fraction x. Similar to the case of PDFs, one can\nexpand the proton states in the light-cone Fock basis. Doing so, one derives the overlap\nrepresentation of GPDs [26, 27].\n\n100\n\n\fAppendix D\n\nWavefunctions and Form Factors in\n(3 + 1) Dimensions\nIn this Appendix we collect results relevant for Chapter 3 for wavefunctions and form factors\nin the (3 + 1)-dimensional ladder model Eq. (2.33).\n\nD.1\n\nWavefunctions\n\nUsing the Bethe-Salpeter equation (2.1) and the definition of the light-cone wavefunction\n|\u03c8R i Eq. (2.31) we have the light-cone bound-state equation\n|\u03c8R i = g(R)w(R)|\u03c8R i,\n\n(D.1)\n\nwhere w(R) is the reduced auxiliary kernel\n\n\u0001\u0002\nw(R) = g \u22121 (R) G(R)W (R)G(R) g\u22121 (R),\n\n(D.2)\n\nwith W (R) defined in Eq. (2.12).\nTo leading order in G \u2212 G\u0303, one calculates w(R) for the ladder model to be:\nV (x, k\u22a5 ; y, p\u22a5 |M 2 ) \u2261 \u2212h xR+ , k\u22a5 | w(R) | yR+ , p\u22a5 i\ng2 h\n\u03b8(x \u2212 y)D(x, k\u22a5 ; y, p\u22a5 |M 2 )\n=\nx\u2212y\ni\n\b\n\u2212 (x, k\u22a5 ) \u2190\u2192 (y, p\u22a5 ) \u03b8[x(1 \u2212 x)]\u03b8[y(1 \u2212 y)], (D.3)\np\n\np\n\nk\n\nk\n\n+\n\nFigure D.1: Diagrammatic representation of the one-boson exchange potential V appearing\nin Eq.

The remaining diagrams E and F are\nthe first of infinitely many required to maintain covariance.\nwhere we have defined\n2\n\nD\n\n\u22121\n\n2\n\np\u22a5 + m2 (k\u22a5 \u2212 p\u22a5 )2 + \u03bc2 k\u22a5 + m2\n(x, k ; y, p |M ) = M \u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\n,\ny\nx\u2212y\n1\u2212x\n\u22a5\n\n\u22a5\n\n2\n\n2\n\n(D.4)\n\nand taken R\u22a5 = 0. Graphically this one-boson exchange potential Eq. (D.3) is depicted in\nFigure D.1.\nFor reference, the bound-state equation (D.1) appears as\nZ\ndydp\u22a5\n\u22a5\n\u22a5\n2\n\u03c8(x, k ) = DW (x, k |M )\nV (x, k\u22a5 ; y, p\u22a5 |M 2 )\u03c8(y, p\u22a5 )\n(D.5)\n2(2\u03c0)3 y(1 \u2212 y)\nA few comments about these results are in order. Truncation of the series in G \u2212 G\u0303 violates Lorentz symmetry because G\u0303 is intrinsically related to projection onto the light cone.\nAlthough the covariant one boson exchange generates at leading order the two light-cone\ntime-ordered one boson exchanges depicted in Figure D.1, there are infinitely many terms\nin the covariant ladder which are missing. To make this clear, we write out the second-order\nkernel in the reduction scheme.\nAt second order, the reduced auxiliary kernel reads\nh\ni\n(D.6)\nw(2) (R) = g\u22121 (R) G(R)V (R) G(R) \u2212 G\u0303(R) V (R)G(R) g\u22121 (R).\n\nFor the moment, we ignore the subtraction term, insert the effective resolution of unity\nand evaluate the expression using Cauchy's residue theorem. The horrendous details are\n102\n\n\fcontained in [72]. Contributions to w(2) are depicted as light-cone time-ordered diagrams\nin Figure D.2. Notice that the diagrams A-D can be summed into the square of the firstorder interaction. In this sense they are reducible contributions and are subtracted off by\nthe G\u0303(R) term in Eq. (D.6). The remaining two diagrams (E and F) are characterized by\nfour quanta propagating at a given instant of time. These contributions are irreducible\nand represent the first of a string of infinitely many interactions omitted from the covariant\nladder.

For brevity we have omitted writing the M 2\ndependence.\n\nD.2\n\nForm factors\n\nTo calculate form factors, we use the electromagnetic vertex \u0393\u03bc constructed in [38] up to\nthe first Born approximation (notice that the ladder model's gauged interaction V \u03bc = 0)\n\u0010\u2194\n\u2194 \u0011\n(D.9)\n\u0393\u03bc = \u2202 \u03bc + V G \u2202 \u03bc d\u22121\n2 ,\n\u2194\n\nwhere \u2202 \u03bc denotes the electromagnetic coupling to scalars.\nNow using Eq.

For a nice, complete discussion of this formalism for\nthe light-cone ladder model, see [122]. In this Appendix, we show how to derive higher\nFock space components in this formalism, thereby demonstrating the generation of higher\ncomponents from the lowest sector we found indirectly for GPDs and form factors in section\n3.2.\nWe write the light-cone Hamiltonian as a sum of a free piece and an interacting piece\nwhich carries an explicit power of the weak coupling g. In an obvious notation this is\nP \u2212 = Po\u2212 + gPI\u2212 .\n\n(E.1)\n\nThe free term Po\u2212 is diagonal in the Fock state basis, while the interaction generally mixes\ncomponents of different particle number (in the scalar model we consider above, the interaction is completely off-diagonal since there are no instantaneous terms). Let us suppose\nthat in the full Fock basis, we have an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian, i.e.\n\u0011\n\u0010\n(E.2)\nPo\u2212 + gPI\u2212 |\u03c8i = p\u2212 |\u03c8i,\n\nwhere the eigenvalue is labeled by p\u2212 . Since the coupling is presumed small, the mixing\nof Fock components with a large number of particles will be small. Thus one imagines our\nbound state will be dominated by the two-body Fock component.\nTo make this observation formal, we define projection operators on the Fock space P\nand Q in the usual sense. The operator P projects out only the two-particle subspace of\nthe full Fock space and hence Q projects out the compliment. Let us define the action of\nthese operators on our eigenstate\nP|\u03c8i = |\u03c82 i\n\nQ|\u03c8i = |\u03c8Q i.\n\n(E.3)\n(E.4)\n\nAs is well known, combination of Eqs. (E.3) and (E.4) leads to the following equation\nfor the two-body Fock component\n\u2212\nPeff\n|\u03c82 i = p\u2212 |\u03c82 i,\n\n106\n\n(E.5)\n\n\fwhere the effective two-body Hamiltonian is\n\u2212\n\u2212\n+ Veff\nPeff\n\u2261 PPP\n\u2212\n\u2212\n+ PPQ\n= PPP\n\n(E.6)\np\u2212\n\n1\n\u2212\n\u2212 PQP ,\n\u2212 PQQ\n\n(E.7)\n\n\u2212\n\u2261 AP \u2212 B.\nand we have defined the following notation for any operators A and B, PAB\nThe effective two-body interaction Veff defined in equation (E.6) is dependent upon the\nenergy eigenvalue p\u2212 since we have suppressed the degrees of freedom of the Q subspace.\nThe relation between the Q-space probability (i.e. the non-valence contribution) and the\neffective interaction appears\n\nh\u03c8Q |\u03c8Q i = \u2212\n\n\u2202\nh\u03c82 |Veff |\u03c82 i.\n\u2202p\u2212\n\n(E.8)\n\nIn a weak-binding limit, we can series expand the effective interaction in powers of the\ncoupling and thereby re-derive the light-front potential. Given that every boson emitted\nmust be absorbed in the two-quark sector, we can have only an even number of interactions\nand hence\n!2n\n\u221e\n\u2212\nX\ngP\n1\nI\n(E.9)\nQgPI\u2212 P.\nVeff = PgPI\u2212 Q \u2212\np \u2212 Po\u2212 n=0 p\u2212 \u2212 Po\u2212\n\nSo, for example, at leading order we have all possible ways to propagate from the two-body\nsector and back with only two interactions in between. The diagrams in Figure D.1 corre1\nspond to the two possibilities distinguished by the action of p\u2212 \u2212P\n\u2212 between interactions.\no\nAt the next order, we have all possible ways to propagate from two bodies to two bodies\nwith four interactions in between, etc.\nTo generate higher Fock components from the two-body sector, we necessarily must look\nat the Q-space state arrived at from Eqs. (E.3) and (E.4)\n|\u03c8Q i =\n\np\u2212\n\n1\n\u2212\n\u2212 PQP |\u03c82 i.\n\u2212 PQQ\n\n(E.10)\n\nTo generate an n-body Fock component from this state, we merely act with an n-body\nprojection operator which we shall denote Qn . Similar to the above, we expand in powers\nof the coupling to find\n!n\n\u221e\nX\ngPI\u2212\n1\n(E.11)\nQgPI\u2212 |\u03c82 i.\n|\u03c8n i = Qn \u2212\np \u2212 Po\u2212 n=0 p\u2212 \u2212 Po\u2212\nFor example, the leading-order three-body state is obtained by attaching a boson to a quark\nline in the only two possible ways (and adding the light-front energy denominator at the\nend). With these three-body states, we can consider all possible three-to-three overlaps that\nwould contribute to the form factor. These are depicted in Figure 2.6 (with the exception\nof a quark self-interaction). The four-body sector is richer since there are two-boson, twoquark states as well as four-quark states. The two-to-four overlaps required for GPDs must\nhave four quarks. At leading order, we generate the diagrams encountered above in Figure\n2.7. Not surprisingly directly applying time-ordered perturbation theory from a light-front\nHamiltonian agrees with our derivation above from covariant perturbation theory in the\nBethe-Salpeter formalism projected onto the light cone.\n107\n\n\fAppendix F\n\nApplication to Timelike Processes\nIn this Appendix, we pursue timelike processes in light-front dynamics. These processes do\nnot have a Fock space wavefunction representation. Below we study time-like form factors\nin particular to demonstrate the versatility of the light-front reduction of the BSE. This\nwill allow us to make the connection to the generalized distribution amplitudes (GDAs),\nwhich we explicitly calculate for the ladder model. Analogous to GPDs, GDAs encode the\nsoft physics of two-meson production and can thus be thought of as crossed versions of the\nGPDs. The GDAs enter in convolutions for various two-meson production amplitudes, see\ne.g. [124\u2013127]. These distribution functions as well as time-like form factors are a theoretical\nchallenge for light-front dynamics, since there is no direct decomposition in terms of meson\nFock components alone. Furthermore, we shall see the leading-order expressions are nonvalence contributions (which necessarily excludes a description in terms of constituent quark\nmodels).\nThe time-like form factor F (s) for our model meson is defined by (see Figure F.1)\n\n\u0001\n\nh\u03a8p \u03a8p\u2032 | \u0393\u03bc |0i = \u2212i(p \u2212 p\u2032 )\u03bc F (s),\n\n(F.1)\n\nwhere s = (p + p\u2032 )2 is the center of mass energy squared. Now define P \u03bc = p\u03bc + p\u2032\u03bc and\n\u03b6 = p+ /P + . We can work out the kinematics of this reaction in a frame where P\u22a5 = 0 and\n\np\n\nP\n\n\u0016\n\np\n\n0\n\nFigure F.1: The triangle diagram for the time-like, pion form factor.\n\n108\n\n\fsee that\ns\n,\n2P +\n(1 \u2212 \u03b6)s\np\u2212 =\n,\n2P +\np2\u22a5 = s(1 \u2212 \u03b6)\u03b6 \u2212 M 2 ,\n\nP\u2212 =\n\n(F.2)\n\nwhere M is the meson mass.\nSimilar to GPDs, the GDA for our model has a definition in terms of a non-diagonal\nmatrix element of bilocal field operators1\nZ\n\u2194\ndx\u2212 izP + x\u2212\n(F.3)\nh\u03a8p \u03a8p\u2032 | q(0)i \u2202 + q(x\u2212 ) |0i.\ne\n\u03a6(z, \u03b6, s) =\n2\u03c0\nAs in Section 3.2, our concern is only with the twist-two contribution and thus we have\ntaken the plus-component of the vector current in Eq. (F.3). The definition of the GDA\nleads directly to a sum rule for the time-like form factor\nZ\ndz\n\u03a6(z, \u03b6, s) = F (s),\n(F.4)\n2\u03b6 \u2212 1\nand hence a means to calculate \u03a6 from the integrand of the time-like form factor. Again\nthis is because the effect of the non-local light-cone operator is to fix the plus momentum\nof the active quark.\nTaking the appropriate residues of the five-point function, we arrive at Fig. F.1 for the\ntime-like form factor. Keeping only the leading-order piece of the electromagnetic vertex\n\u0393\u03bc , we have\n\u03a6(z, \u03b6, s) = iP + (2z \u2212 1)\n\nZ\n\ndk\u2212 dk\u22a5 \u2217 \u2032\u2032 \u22a5\n\u03b3 (z , k \u2212 z \u2032\u2032 p\u22a5 |M 2 )G(k, p)d\u22121 (k \u2212 p)\n(2\u03c0)4\n\u0001\n\u00d7 G(P \u2212 k, p\u2032 )\u03b3 \u2217 z \u2032 , k\u22a5 \u2212 (1 \u2212 z \u2032 )p\u22a5 M 2 , (F.5)\n\n\u2032\u2032\nwhere we have made use of some auxiliary definitions: z = k+ /P + , z \u2032 = z\u2212\u03b6\n1\u2212\u03b6 and z = z/\u03b6.\nRecall \u03b3(x|M 2 ) \u221d \u03b8[x(1 \u2212 x)]. This translates to: 0 < z \u2032\u2032 < 1 and 0 < z \u2032 < 1, and hence we\ndo not pick up a contribution at zeroth order in the coupling.\nTo work at first order, we pick up three terms analogous to those in Appendix D for\nthe spacelike form factor. We denote these as \u03b4J\u03b3\u03bc , \u03b4Jp\u03bc and \u03b4Jp\u03bc\u2032 . The Born term for the\nthree-point electromagnetic vertex \u03b4J\u03b3\u03bc is quite simple. For the same reason as the zerothorder result, the restriction of \u03b3(x|M 2 ) \u221d \u03b8[x(1 \u2212 x)] and momentum conservation force\nthe contribution \u03b4J\u03b3\u03bc to vanish. This leaves us to consider only diagrams that arise from\niteration of the Bethe-Salpeter equation for either of the final-state mesons.\nConsidering first the term \u03b4Jp\u03bc , we have the contribution to the GDA\n\n\u03a6p (z, \u03b6, s) = iP + (2z \u2212 1)\n\nZ\n\ndk \u2212 dk\u22a5 d4 q \u2217 \u2032 \u22a5\n\u03b3 (z , k \u2212 (1 \u2212 z \u2032 )p\u22a5 )d\u22121 (k \u2212 p)\n(2\u03c0)4 (2\u03c0)4\n\u00d7 \u03b3 \u2217 (y \u2032\u2032 , q\u22a5 \u2212 y \u2032\u2032 p\u22a5 )G(q, p)V (q, k)G(k, p)G(P \u2212 k, p\u2032 ), (F.6)\n\n1\n\nAnd similar to our discussion of GPDs, perturbative QCD corrections lead to renormalization scale\ndependence of the GDAs. For a complete discussion of O(\u03b1s ) corrections in the crossed channel, see,\ne.g. [12].\n\n109\n\n\f\u0001\u0002\n\na\n\nb\n\nFigure F.2: Leading-order diagrams for the time-like pion form factor.\n\nwhere we have chosen to abbreviate y = q + /P + and hence the label y \u2032\u2032 = y/\u03b6. We have\ncustomarily omitted the subtracted term containing G\u0303, which is zero because there is no\nleading-order term to subtract. Requiring wavefunction vertices mandates 0 < y \u2032\u2032 < 1 and\n\u03b6 < z < 1.\nThus after integration over the loop energy, \u03a6p produces one contribution to the GDA\n\u03a6p (z, \u03b6, s) =\n\n\u03b8(z \u2212 \u03b6)\n(16\u03c0 3 )2 \u03b6\n\nZ\n\ng 2 \u03b8(z \u2212 y)\ndk\u22a5 dydq\u22a5 (2z \u2212 1)\n\u22a5\nD\n(z,\nk\n|s)\nW\nz(1 \u2212 z)z \u2032 y \u2032\u2032 (1 \u2212 y \u2032\u2032 )\nz\u2212y\n\n\u00d7 D(z, k\u22a5 ; y, q\u22a5 |s)\u03c8 \u2217 (z \u2032 , k\u22a5 \u2212 (1 \u2212 z \u2032 )p\u22a5 )\u03c8 \u2217 (y \u2032\u2032 , q\u22a5 \u2212 y \u2032\u2032 p\u22a5 ).

(F.7) or (F.9). One needs a Fock space expansion for the\nphoton wavefunction in order to have an expression for the GDA in terms of various Fock\ncomponent overlaps. With the expressions derived for the GDA, we can use Eq. (F.4) to\nobtain the time-like form factor. Notice the expressions derived for the GDA and hence\nalso for the timelike form factor depend on pieces of the light-front interaction kernel. Thus\nthere is no way to directly utilize quark model wavefunctions for these observables.\n\n110\n\n\fAppendix G\n\nComplex Conjugate Poles in\nMinkowski Space\nIn this Appendix we show that amplitudes cannot be directly calculated in Minkowski\nspace when complex conjugate poles are present in propagators and vertices. We then\ninvestigate how to calculate amplitudes properly in Minkowski space. Firstly amplitudes\ndependent on the imaginary part of some set of diagrams can be calculated by using a\nstraightforward generalization of the cutting rules. We apply this to calculate the quark\ndistribution function from the handbag diagram in the Bjorken limit in Section G.2. Lastly\nwe consider the analytic continuation of space-like amplitudes from Euclidean space. This\nis complicated by the presence of Wick poles and requires their residues to be appropriately\nadded when amplitudes are calculated. The details of the GPD calculation appear at the\nend of this Appendix in Section G.4. Resulting functions calculated in Minkowski space\nafter the Wick rotation agree with those obtained from the model defined in Euclidean\nspace.\nThis work lays the foundation for calculating light-cone dominated amplitudes using\nmeromorphic model propagators and vertices constrained by both lattice data1 and WardTakahashi identities. Distribution functions for such models could be calculated rigorously\nsince the pole structure of the propagator is known and relevant integrals converge in the\ncomplex light-cone energy plane. As far as light-cone phenomenology is concerned, resulting\nexpressions would be truly Poincar\u00e9 covariant (as opposed to diagonal with respect to the\nnon-interacting operators) and would satisfy field-theoretic identities. Filling these two gaps\nis essential for adequate hadronic phenomenology for processes at large momentum transfer.\nMoreover, such models would help light-cone methods and Dyson-Schwinger studies reach\ncomplementary standing.\n\nG.1\n\nModel defined\n\nThe model we take is \u03c63 theory with electromagnetic interactions. Equivalently we can\nview this model as a bound state of two scalar particles with a trivial Bethe-Salpeter vertex\n\u0393(k, P ) = 1, where the coupling constant is assumed to be absorbed into the overall normalization, see Section 1.2.2. We make a simple Ansatz for the non-perturbative propagator\n1\nOne must proceed with caution: the lattice calculations employ Landau gauge, while we have tacitly\nused light-cone gauge above.\n\n111\n\n\f\u0001\nk\n\nk\n\nk\n\nP\n\nP\n\nP\n\nFigure G.1: Triangle diagram at zero momentum transfer used to calculate the quark\ndistribution function by projecting onto the light cone.\n\nconsisting of a pair of complex conjugate poles\nS(k) =\n\ni(k2 \u2212 a2 + b2 )\n,\n(k2 \u2212 a2 + b2 )2 + 4a2 b2\n\n(G.1)\n\nwhere a2 \u2212 b2 > 0.

Although we use a scalar model,\nresults straightforwardly extend to spin- 12 particles, e.g., since only the pole structure of\nEq. (G.1) is relevant.\nNow let us consider calculating this model's quark distribution by projecting onto the\nlight cone. The quark distribution can be derived by fixing the plus-momentum of the active\nquark x = k+ /P + , see Figure G.1, and taking the plus-component of the current. Thus up\nto overall normalization, we have the expression\nZ\nq(x) \u221d d4 k \u03b4(k+ \u2212 xP + ) xS(k)S(k \u2212 P )S(k).\n(G.4)\nka\u2212 =\n\nThe k\u2212 integral is then performed by residues.

Dashed line denotes\nthe cut which yields the quark distribution in the Bjorken limit.\n\nThis distribution does not have proper support, i.e. it is non-vanishing outside the interval x \u2208 [0, 1]. Moreover, the distribution is not real valued, whereas it should be positive\ndefinite. Thus the model based on the propagator in Eq. (G.1) cannot be suitably formulated in Minkowski space. We will find below that Eq. (G.1) makes sense as a Minkowski\nspace propagator only after analytic continuation from Euclidean space for the amplitude\nin question. In Section 4.2.3, we demonstrated that the model is perfectly well defined in\nEuclidean space and thus the challenge of analytic continuation remains.\n\nG.2\n\nCutting rules\n\nIn this Section, we show there is some hope in working with the model propagator Eq. (G.1)\nin Minkowski space. We demonstrate that the quark distribution can be derived by a\nstraightforward generalization of the cutting rules.\nConsider the forward Compton amplitude T \u03bc\u03bd (q, P ) depicted in Figure G.2. In the\nBjorken limit, the imaginary part of this diagram is related to the quark distribution, see\nSection 1.1. For simplicity, we can choose a frame in which q\u22a5 = 0. The minus-plus\ncomponent of the forward Compton amplitude in such frames reads\nZ\n16N\n\u2212+\nd4 k (2k\u2212 + q \u2212 )S(k) S(k \u2212 P ) S(k) (2k+ + q + )S(k + q). (G.7)\niT (q, P ) = \u2212 3\n\u03c0\nIn the scalar particle case, the minus-plus component of the forward Compton amplitude\ncan be used to define the quark distribution in a way analogous to the spin- 12 case. The\nrelation is simply Im(T \u2212+ ) \u221d q(x), see [30]. In Eq. (G.7), we have adjusted the overall\nnormalization so that equality between Im(T \u2212+ ) and q(x) holds. With standard perturbative propagators, we could calculate the imaginary part of T \u03bc\u03bd (q, P ) by using the cutting\nrules, whereby one replaces the cut propagators in Figure G.2 by an on-shell prescription,\nnamely\nS(k)\u03b5=0 \u2212\u2192 \u22122\u03c0i \u03b4(k2 \u2212 m2 ).\n(G.8)\nIn Eq. (G.8), we have specified \u03b5 = 0 for the case of a free particle propagator. Since\nlarge momentum flows through the handle of the handbag, we may neglect the mass of\nthe struck quark and use the standard cutting rule for S(k + q). In the Bjorken limit, we\ndefine x = \u2212q 2 /2P * q which remains finite as q 2 , P * q \u2192 \u221e and is kinematically bounded\nbetween zero and one. Further we orient our frame of reference so that q has a large minus\ncomponent in this limit, and consequently q + = q 2 /2q \u2212 is finite. Hence we have the familiar\n113\n\n\freplacement\nS(k + q) \u2212\u2192 \u2212\n\n\u03c0i\n\u03b4(k+ \u2212 xP + ).\n2q \u2212\n\n(G.9)\n\nTo complete the cut, we must deal with the spectator particle's complex mass shells.\nWe must worry about the propagator Eq. (G.1) only where the denominator is zero. Thus\nwe are lead to the cutting rule for the propagator Eq. (G.1)\nh\ni\nS(k) \u2212\u2192 \u2212\u03c0i \u03b4(k2 \u2212 m2 + i\u03b5) + \u03b4(k2 \u2212 m2 \u2212 i\u03b5) ,\n(G.10)\n\nwhich puts the intermediate state on its complex mass shells. Furthermore, the limit \u03b5 \u2192 0\nproduces the regular cutting rule Eq. (G.8).\nUsing this cutting rule for the spectator particle along with Eq. (G.9), we can deduce\nthe quark distribution from Im(T \u2212+ ) in the Bjorken limit2\nZ\nh\ni xS(k)2\n4N\nq(x) =\n,\n(G.11)\nd4 k \u03b4(k+ \u2212 xP + ) \u03b4(k\u2212 \u2212 kb\u2212 ) + \u03b4(k\u2212 \u2212 kb\u2212\u2217 )\n\u03c0\n1\u2212x\n\nwhere the light-cone energy poles are given in Eq.

(4.49). Notice Eq. (G.11) is equivalent to evaluating\nEq. (G.4) at Res(kb\u2212 )+Res(kb\u2212\u2217 ) and hence the quark distribution is derived as if the complex\nconjugate spectator poles both lie in the upper-half complex plane! We will understand this\nbetter once we analytically continue from Euclidean space.\n\nG.3\n\nAnalytic continuation\n\nAbove we have seen that modified cutting rules can be used to derive the correct quark\ndistribution function in Minkowski space. In essence the result stems from putting the\nspectator particle on its complex mass shells. This must be justified by careful analytic\ncontinuation of Euclidean space amplitudes. Below we consider the Minkowski space calculation of the generalized parton distribution which cannot be derived by cuts. This will force\nus to deal with the underlying Wick rotation necessary to define the model in Minkowski\nspace.\n2\n\nThis may seem obvious. But there are two inconsistencies which will ultimately be resolved in Section\nG.3. First Eq. (G.7) is not the Minkowski space amplitude. As already mentioned it requires analytic\ncontinuation. Second the rule Eq. (G.10), although plausible, does not produce the imaginary part of\nEq. (G.7). The result Eq. (G.12), however, leads us to believe these two wrongs make proverbial right.\n\n114\n\n\fIm(k )\n\nIm(k )\n\na\n_\n\na*\n\n+\n0\n_\n\nx>0\n\n_\n\n_\n\nx<0\n\n_\n\n+\n\n0\n\n+\n\na*\n\n0\n_\n\n_\n\nRe(k )\n\n0\n\n+\n\na\n_\n\nRe(k )\n\nFigure G.3: Complex light-cone energy plane for the propagator.\n\nIn Section 4.2.3, the model double distributions were calculated in Euclidean space.\nThus to calculate related amplitudes in Minkowski space, we must Wick rotate in the\ncomplex energy plane: k4 \u2192 ik0 . The analytic continuation can be viewed alternately in\nthe complex light-cone energy plane. For k3 = 0, the rotation is from the Im(k\u2212 ) axis to\nthe Re(k\u2212 ) axis. In the general case, such a correspondence can only be made precise by\nconsidering the Wick rotation in terms of k0 and then boosting to the infinite momentum\nframe. This requires tedious algebraic manipulations and a proliferation of energy poles\nand time-ordered diagrams. Indeed it is easier just to imagine the rotation simply and deal\nwith the light-cone singularities. This is the approach we present.\nBefore tackling the model's generalized parton distributions in Minkowski space, let us\nimagine a simpler fictitious example. Consider some well-defined Euclidean space amplitude\nhaving only poles at ka\u2212 and ka\u2212\u2217 , see Eq. (G.3). To calculate the amplitude in Minkowski\nspace, we naively integrate along the Re(k\u2212 ) axis. In general the correct path on which\nto integrate is one which nears the Re(k\u2212 ) axis except for detours around energy poles in\nthe first and third quadrants. Such a path is correct since it can be continuously deformed\ninto the Euclidean path. The difference between the naive integration and the correct path\nis a sum of residues of the Wick poles. The energy poles of our fictitious amplitude are\ndepicted in Figure G.3. Their location depends upon the sign of x = k+ /P + . Thus for this\namplitude the correct continuation from Euclidean space is\nZ\nZ\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u2212\n(G.14)\nd Im(k ) \u2212\u2192 d Re(k\u2212 ) + 2\u03c0i \u03b8(\u2212x) \u2212 \u03b8(x) Res(ka\u2212\u2217 ).\n\nNotice only ka\u2212\u2217 is a Wick pole; this is expected because we know the limit \u03b5 \u2192 0 can be\nanalytically continued in the naive fashion. Closing the contour in the upper-half plane\nto perform the Minkowski space energy integral3 and evaluate our fictitious amplitude, we\npick up 2\u03c0i[\u03b8(\u2212x) Res(ka\u2212 ) + \u03b8(x) Res(ka\u2212\u2217 )]. The net result according to Eq. (G.14) is thus\n\u0003\n\u0002\n2\u03c0i\u03b8(\u2212x) Res(ka\u2212 ) + Res(ka\u2212\u2217 ) .\n3\n\nOne must be careful of zero modes [21] for which k+ = 0. In such cases, the pole lies on the contour at\ninfinity and the integration cannot be performed by residues. Since our fictitious example is only schematic,\nwe are neglecting the issue of zero modes and are hence excluding amplitudes of the form\nXZ\nd4 k\n, n > 2,\n2\n(k \u2212 m2 + i\u03b5)n\n\u03b5=\u00b1\nwhich must be handled separately. The example\nZ\n(k2\n\n\u2212\n\nm2\n\nd4 k\n+ i\u03b5)2 (k2 \u2212 m2 \u2212 i\u03b5)2\n\nis devoid of zero-mode complications and more closely parallels the expressions encountered for GPDs.\n\n115\n\n\fLooking back at Figure G.3, the net result after Wick rotation amounts to both poles\nlying in the same half-plane; or equivalently, we have effectively integrated in either the\nright- or left-half plane. The result that both poles lie in the same half-plane reflects quark\nconfinement; the quark wavefunction must vanish as time becomes large [89].\nThe space-like amplitude4 for the generalized parton distribution can now be continued\nto Minkowski space and hence be evaluated by projecting onto the light cone. To do so,\n\u2194\n\nwe refer to Figure 4.3 and insert the non-local light-cone operator \u03c6(0)iD + \u03c6(z \u2212 ) in place\nof the local twist-two operators denoted by a cross in the Figure. Here the plus-component\npicks out the leading-twist contribution according to light-cone power counting. Thus in\nmomentum space, we arrive at\nZ\n2N/\u03c0 2\nd4 k \u03b4(k+ \u2212 xP + ) (2k+ + \u2206+ ) S(k)S(k \u2212 P )S(k + \u2206).\n(G.15)\nH(x, \u03b6, t) =\n1 \u2212 \u03b6/2\n\u2194\n\nAbove we have included the \u03b6-dependent pre-factor to normalize the action of D + between\nnon-diagonal states. The overall normalization is then the same as in Eq. (4.44). By\nwriting Eq. (G.15) in Minkowski space, we must also keep in mind the Wick residues\nimplicitly necessary so that Eq. (G.15) is meaningful. In addition to the poles ka\u2212 , kb\u2212\n[given in Eqs. (G.3) and (G.5), respectively] and their complex conjugates, the integrand of\nEq. (G.15) also has the poles\nkc\u2212 = \u2212\u2206\u2212 +\n\ni\u03b5\n(k\u22a5 + \u2206\u22a5 )2 + m2\n\u2212\n+\n+\n+\n2(k + \u2206 )\n2(k + \u2206+ )\n\n(G.16)\n\nand kc\u2212\u2217 = (kc\u2212 )\u2217 . Carrying out the light-cone energy integration in Eq. (G.15) as well as\nadding relevant residues resulting from the Wick rotation produces (the subtle details of\nthis calculation appear at the end of this Appendix in Section G.4)\ni\nh\nH(x, \u03b6, t) = \u22122\u03c0i \u03b8(x)\u03b8(\u03b6 \u2212 x) Res(ka\u2212 ) + Res(ka\u2212\u2217 )\n\nh\ni\n+ 2\u03c0i \u03b8(x \u2212 \u03b6)\u03b8(1 \u2212 x) Res(kb\u2212 ) + Res(kb\u2212\u2217 ) , (G.17)\n\nwhere the residue is of the integrand in Eq. (G.15). As a result of the effective relocation\nof poles to the same half-plane as their complex conjugates, the resulting GPD Eq. (G.17)\nis real and vanishes outside x from zero to one.\nUsing the Weinberg propagator Eq. (G.13), the residues can be compactly written in\nterms of relative momenta. Defining the relative momentum of the final state as\nx\u2032 =\n\nx\u2212\u03b6\n,\n1\u2212\u03b6\n\nk\u2032\u22a5 = k\u22a5 + (1 \u2212 x\u2032 )\u2206\u22a5 ,\n\n(G.18)\n\nand the relative momentum of the photon as\nx\u2032\u2032 =\n\nx\n,\n\u03b6\n\nk\u2032\u2032\u22a5 = k\u22a5 + x\u2032\u2032 \u2206\u22a5 ,\n\n4\n\n(G.19)\n\nThere are additional complications for time-like amplitudes and for amplitudes involving unstable bound\nstates. In these cases Wick poles are present even when standard perturbative propagators are used. The\nanalysis above must be more carefully considered in these cases where threshold effects are already inherent\nin the analytic continuation to, or from, Euclidean space.\n\n116\n\n\fthe light-cone GPD can be expressed in the form\n(1 \u2212 \u03b6/2) H(x, \u03b6, t) = \u03b8(x)\u03b8(\u03b6 \u2212 x) H1 (x, \u03b6, t) + \u03b8(x \u2212 \u03b6)\u03b8(1 \u2212 x) H2 (x, \u03b6, t),\n\n(G.20)\n\nwhere we have made the abbreviations\nZ\nN X\nDW (x, k\u22a5 , \u03b5, \u03b5\u2032\u2032 |M 2 )DW (x\u2032\u2032 , k\u2032\u2032\u22a5 , \u03b5, \u03b5\u2032 | t )\n\u2032\u2032\nH1 (x, \u03b6, t) = (2x \u2212 1)\n(G.21)\ndk\u22a5\n2\u03c0 \u2032 \u2032\u2032\nx\u2032\u2032 (1 \u2212 x\u2032\u2032 )(1 \u2212 x)\n\u03b5,\u03b5 ,\u03b5 =\u00b1\nZ\nDW (x, k\u22a5 , \u03b5, \u03b5\u2032\u2032 |M 2 )DW (x\u2032 , k\u2032\u22a5 , \u03b5\u2032 , \u03b5\u2032\u2032 |M 2 )\nN X\ndk\u22a5\nH2 (x, \u03b6, t) = (2x \u2212 \u03b6)\n2\u03c0 \u2032 \u2032\u2032\nx(1 \u2212 x)x\u2032\n\u03b5,\u03b5 ,\u03b5 =\u00b1\n\n(G.22)\n\nFirstly one can see analytically that the correct quark distribution results at zero momentum transfer, namely H2 (x, 0, 0) = q(x), where q(x) is given by Eq. (G.12). As remarked\nin Section G.2, this function is identical to that obtained from the double distribution\nEq. (4.49). Secondly, the resulting light-cone GPD Eq. (G.20) agrees numerically with that\nfound from the double distribution, via Eq. (4.40), which is plotted in Figure 4.5. Finally\nthe electromagnetic form factor found from the sum rule\nZ 1\ndx H(x, \u03b6, t)\n(G.23)\nF (t) =\n0\n\nagrees numerically with the result of Eq. (4.41) (which is plotted in Figure 4.4). The\n\u03b6-independence of Eq. (G.23) stems from Lorentz invariance which is present, however,\nnot manifest in Eq. (G.20). Thus with the calculation of Eq. (G.20) from analytically\ncontinuing to Minkowski space, space-like amplitudes now agree with those calculated from\nthe Euclidean space double distribution.\n\nG.4\n\nCalculation of the GPD\n\nBelow we derive Eq. (G.17) for the GPD in Minkowski space. The details have been\nrelegated here since there is some subtlety. In order to evaluate Eq. (G.15), which implicitly\nneeds analytic continuation, we must shift the energy integration variable and define a\nprescription for dealing with vanishing real parts. Let us see how these difficulties arise.\nIn considering the Wick rotation, one is usually only concerned with the single denominator that results from combining propagators via Feynman parameters. For the moment,\nlet us ignore the complication of complex conjugate pairs of poles. In this case, combining\nthe denominators of Eq. (4.44) using Feynman parameters results in [l2 \u2212 Do (x, y; t) + i\u03b5]\u22123 ,\nwhere Do is given by Eq. (4.45). Since the bound state is stable and t is space-like, Do (x, y; t)\nis always positive and hence there are no Wick poles. Moreover, we have shifted the variable\nk\u03bc to arrive at l\u03bc .\nIn analytically continuing the expression with uncombined propagators (and again no\ncomplex conjugate poles), we are confronted with a problem. The pole kb\u2212 , for example, is\nshifted by the energy P \u2212 . Thus the location of the singularity in the complex plane will be\nshifted parallel to the real axis depending upon the relative magnitude of the spectator's\nkinetic energy and P \u2212 . In the schematic example shown in Section G.3, the pole ka\u2212 does\nnot have such a shift. Thus for the b and c poles, the location of the singularities depicted\nin Figure G.3 will shift along the real axis (depending on P \u2212 and \u2206\u2212 ) and there will be\n117\n\n\fc\n\n+\n\nb\n\nb*\n\nc*\n\nc\n\n0\n\n_\n\na*\n\n_\n\n_\n\na\n\n_\n\n0<x<\u03b6\n\nIm(k )\n\nIm(k )\n\nx<0\n\nc*\n\n+\n\na*\n\n0\n\n_\n\n+\n\n0\n\nb\n\nb*\n\n_\n\n0\n\n+\n\na\n\n_\n\n_\n\nRe(k )\n\nb\n_\n\nb*\n\n+\n\nx>1\n\n_\n\nc*\n\n0\n_\n\nIm(k )\n\n_\n\nIm(k )\n\n\u03b6 <x<1\n\nRe(k )\n\na*\n\na*\n\nc\n\n0\n\n_\n\n+\n\n0\n\n+\nb*\n\nc*\n\na\n\na\n\nc\n\nb\n\n_\n\n0\n\n+\n_\n\n_\n\nRe(k )\n\nRe(k )\n\nFigure G.4: Complex light-cone energy plane for the shifted poles Eq. (G.26) for the generalized parton distribution.\n\n\u2212\nthreshold Wick poles [the threshold is defined when Re(kb,c\n= 0)]. This is unphysical: we\njust demonstrated the Wick rotation can be done for the combined denominators without\ncrossing any poles. To perform the same Wick rotation at the level of separate propagators,\nwe must use the freedom to shift the energy variable as well as the stability of the bound\nstate.\nOn the light-cone, the bound state stability condition can be expressed as\n2\n\nP\u2212 <\n\nk\u22a5 rel + m2\n,\n2P + x(1 \u2212 x)\n\n(G.24)\n\nwhere k\u22a5 rel = k\u22a5 \u2212 xP\u22a5 is the relative transverse momentum of the two constituents.\nBecause we consider the elastic electromagnetic form factor, there is an analogous relation\nfor the final state P \u2032 . Since each propagator contains the kinetic energy of a single particle,\nthe bound state stability condition can never be utilized without shifting k\u2212 . Yet in order\nto perform such a shift, the real part of one pole must be zero and hence we must invent a\nprescription for moving this pole off the Euclidean contour.\nWe choose the translation: k\u2212 \u2192 k\u2212 + \u03b4k\u2212 + \u03b7, where \u03b7 is a positive infinitesimal and\n2\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03b4k = P\n\n\u2212\n\nk\u22a5 + m2\n+\n.\n2P + (x \u2212 1)\n\n(G.25)\n\nThe resulting poles of the integrand in Eq.

Notice imaginary parts of the poles\nare unaffected by the energy translation. The \u03b7 prescription has displaced the resulting\nspectator pole away from the Euclidean path independent of x. Moreover the a and c poles\nhave non-zero real parts; so \u03b7 has been set to zero for these poles above.\n118\n\n\fUsing the expressions for the new poles Eq. (G.26) and the bound state stability condition Eq. (G.24), we can determine the quadrant location of the singularities independent\nof P \u2212 and \u2206\u2212 (see footnote 2). These quadrant locations are depicted for the full range of\nx in Figure G.4. Accordingly poles in the first and third quadrants are Wick poles. As we\nsaw in Section G.3, the net result of the analytic continuation is to evaluate the integral by\neffectively closing the contour in the right- or left-half plane. Hence the GPD Eq. (G.15) is\ni\nh\nH(x, \u03b6, t) = \u22122\u03c0i \u03b8(x)\u03b8(\u03b6 \u2212 x) Res(k\u0303a\u2212 ) + Res(k\u0303a\u2212\u2217 )\n\ni\nh\n+ 2\u03c0i \u03b8(x \u2212 \u03b6)\u03b8(1 \u2212 x) Res(k\u0303b\u2212 ) + Res(k\u0303b\u2212\u2217 ) . (G.27)\n\nEvaluating the residues in Eq. (G.27) yields the result of Section G.3, namely Eq. (G.20)\nwhich is algebraically equivalent to Eq. (G.17).\n\u03b7\nNotice from Figure G.4, other \u03b7 prescriptions for the shift, such as + 2P + (x\u22121)\n, lead to\nan incorrect result for the case when there are no complex conjugate pairs. The figure shows\nthat the infinitesimal prescription must be positive and independent of the sign of x, x \u2212 \u03b6,\netc, in order to reproduce the familiar result. It is interesting to note that for x > 1 in the\ncase without conjugate pairs, all poles of the integrand are Wick poles. Though since the\nintegral is convergent, the sum of these Wick residues vanishes.\nThe interested reader can verify that the alternate shifts which use the same pole prescription\n(\n2\n\u22a52\n+\u03b7\nk\u2212 \u2192 k\u2212 + k 2P+m\n+x\n(G.28)\n(k\u22a5 +\u2206\u22a5 )2 +m2\n\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2212\nk \u2192 k \u2212 \u2206 + 2P + (x\u2212\u03b6) + \u03b7\nalso yield the correct results provided t is space-like.\n\n119\n\n\fAppendix H\n\nAmbiguity of the Double\nDistributions\nThe decomposition into F (\u03b2, \u03b1; t), G(\u03b2, \u03b1; t) and K(\u03b2, \u03b1; t) DDs is ambiguous. Experimentally one cannot access the DDs directly, only the H(x, \u03be, t) and E(x, \u03be, t) GPDs. In\nRef. [75], the ambiguity inherent in defining DDs for the pion was likened to the gauge\nambiguity of the vector potential of a two-dimensional magnetic field. In this Appendix,\nwe extend this analysis to the proton case.

While the\ndevelopment and derivations above rely exclusively on manifest Lorentz invariance, the\nlight-cone Fock representation provides transparent physical intuition about our model.\nThe light-cone wavefunctions for our model are admittedly simple and thus provide a useful\nguide to understanding the DDs constructed above.\nThe light-cone spinor u\u03bb (k, m) satisfies the Dirac equation (/k \u2212 m)u\u03bb (k, m) = 0 and is\nexplicitly given by (e.g., see [129])\nu\u03bb (k, m) =\n\n\u0011\n\u0010\u221a\n1\n\u221a\n2k+ + \u03b2m + \u03b1\u22a5 * k\u22a5 X\u03bb ,\n21/4 k+\n\n(J.1)\n\nwhere \u03b2 = \u03b3 0 and \u03b1 = \u03b3 0 \u03b3 and the unit spinors X\u03bb are given by\n1\nX\u2191\u2020 = \u221a (1, 0, 1, 0)\n2\n1\nX\u2193\u2020 = \u221a (0, 1, 0, \u22121) .\n2\nUsing Eq. (J.1), we derive the useful product of spinors of different mass and momentum\n\u0002\n\u0003\n1\nu\u03bb\u2032 (k, m)u\u03bb (P, M ) = \u221a\n\u03b4\u03bb\u2032 ,\u03bb (k+ M + P + m) \u2212 \u03bb \u03b4\u03bb\u2032 ,\u2212\u03bb (k+ P\u03bb \u2212 P + k\u03bb ) ,\nk+ P +\n\n(J.2)\n\nwhere the notation a\u03bb = a1 + i\u03bba2 has been employed with the understanding that spins\ncorrespond to the signs \u2191= +1 and \u2193= \u22121.\nUsing the light-cone spinors, one can find the Hq (x, \u03be, t) and Eq (x, \u03be, t) GPDs in terms\n\u2032\nof the light-cone, non-diagonal matrix element M\u03bbq ,\u03bb (x, \u03be, t), namely\nM\u03bb,\u03bb\nq (x, \u03be, t) = p\n\n1\n\n\u0002\n\n\u0003\n(1 \u2212 \u03be 2 )Hq (x, \u03be, t) \u2212 \u03be 2 Eq (x, \u03be, t)\n\n1 \u2212 \u03be2\n\u03bb\u2206\np \u03bb\nEq (x, \u03be, t).\nM\u03bb,\u2212\u03bb\n(x, \u03be, t) = \u2212\nq\n2M 1 \u2212 \u03be 2\n\n(J.3)\n(J.4)\n\nThese expressions can alternately be used to derive GPDs for the model considered in Section 5.2 by directly inserting the quark bilocal operator between non-diagonal proton states.\nExpressions are derived in this manner by integration over the relative light-cone energy\n123\n\n\fk\u2212 at the cost of sacrificing manifest Lorentz invariance. This description in terms of lightcone Fock components, however, is more intuitive to work with than the DD formulation.\nMoreover, the light-cone energy integration obviates the positivity properties of our model\nGPDs. We shall not present complete expressions for the GPDs on the light-cone, however,\nthe diagonal overlap region x > \u03be is particularly simple to consider.\nFor our model, we can find the lowest Fock component's light-cone wavefunction by\nprojecting the covariant amplitude onto the surface x+ = 0, namely\nZ\n\u0011\ndk\u2212 us1 (P \u2212 k, m) \u0010 +\n1\n\u22a5\n\u221a\n\u03c8LC (x, krel ; si , \u03bb) =\n\u03b3\n\u03b3\niC\nus2 (P \u2212 k, m)T\n5\n(2P + )2\n2\u03c0\n1\u2212x\nus3 (k, m) +\n\u00d7 \u221a\n\u03b3 \u03a8(k, P )u\u03bb (P, M ),\n(J.5)\nx\nwhere x is the fraction of the proton's plus momentum carried by the residual quark (x =\n\u22a5\n\u22a5\nk+ /P + ), and the relative transverse momentum is k\u22a5\nrel = k \u2212 xP . Above, \u03bb labels the\nspin of the proton, whereas the si label spins of the three quarks. We have omitted the color\nand isospin parts of the wavefunction which are trivial: \u221d \u03b5c1 ,c2,c3 (\u03b41,u \u03b42,d \u2212 \u03b41,d \u03b42,u )\u03b43,u for\nthe scalar diquark.

Our choice of vertex functions\ncorresponds to only modeling a subset of the possible three quark light-cone wavefunctions\nof the proton [132]. Carrying out the projection in Eq. (J.5), yields\n\u03c8LC (x, k\u22a5\nrel ; si , \u03bb) \u221d\n\ns1 \u03b4s1 ,\u2212s2 [\u03b4s3 ,\u03bb (xM + m) + \u03bb \u03b4s3 ,\u2212\u03bb krel,\u03bb ]\ni .\nh\n\u221a\n2\n2\nk\u22a5\nm2D a\nrel\n\u2212 mx \u2212 1\u2212x\nxa 1 \u2212 x M 2 \u2212 x(1\u2212x)\n\n(J.7)\n\nAbove a = 1 for the valence light-cone wavefunction. The effective wavefunction\neff (x, k\u22a5 ; s , \u03bb) generated by the analytic regularization is given by Eq. (J.7) with a = 2\n\u03c8LC\nrel i\n(or in general a > 1). There are no true higher Fock components in this model since the\ninteraction kernel is instantaneous in light-cone time [47]. Focusing on the spin structure,\nthe scalar diquark channel consists of two states: a state where the proton spin is aligned\nwith residual quark's spin and a state where the quark and diquark are in a relative p-wave.\nThe quark distribution function can be obtained from\nXZ\n2\neff\n(J.8)\nfu (x) =\ndk\u22a5 \u03c8LC\n(x, k\u22a5 ; si , \u03bb) ,\nsi\n\nand agrees with the covariant calculation of qu (x) from its moments in Section 5.2. Similarly\nthe Dirac and Pauli form factors can be expressed in terms of the effective wavefunction\nsince the light-cone contour integration only receives contribution from the diquark pole.\nThe expression are\nXZ\n\u2217eff\neff\nF1 (t) =\ndk\u22a5 dx \u03c8LC\n(x, k\u22a5 + (1 \u2212 x)\u2206\u22a5 ; si , \u03bb)\u03c8LC\n(x, k\u22a5 ; si , \u03bb) (J.9)\nsi\n\nXZ\n\u03bb\u2206\u03bb\n\u2217eff\neff\nF2 (t) =\ndk\u22a5 dx \u03c8LC\n(x, k\u22a5 + (1 \u2212 x)\u2206\u22a5 ; si , \u2212\u03bb)\u03c8LC\n(x, k\u22a5 ; si , \u03bb)(J.10)\n\u2212\n2M\ns\ni\n\n124\n\n\fAlso for this reason, we can express the GPDs as simple convolutions in the diagonal overlap\nx\u2212\u03be\nregion x > \u03be. Let x1 = x+\u03be\n1+\u03be and x2 = 1\u2212\u03be and then we have\n\u03b8(x \u2212\n\n\u03be)M\u03bb,\u03bb\nq (x, \u03be, t)\n\n=\n\nXZ\nsi\n\n\u22a5\n\ndk\n\n\u2217eff\n\u03c8LC\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\u2206\u22a5\n; si , \u03bb\nx2 , k + (1 \u2212 x2 )\n2\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2206\u22a5\neff\n\u22a5\n\u00d7 \u03c8LC x1 , k \u2212 (1 \u2212 x1 )\n; si , \u03bb\n(J.11)\n2\n\u22a5\n\nwith a very similar expression holding for the spin-flip amplitude.

Carrying out the projection in Eq. (J.12) yields the axial diquark\npiece of the light-cone wavefunction. Analogous formulas to the above hold for the axial\ndiquark contribution to the quark distribution, form factors and GPDs for x > \u03be.\n\n125\n\n\fAppendix K\n\nDerivation of the Double\nDistributions\nIn this Appendix, we detail the calculation of the DDs in the scalar diquark channel and\ncomment on the calculation in the axial-vector channel. The crucial steps in the derivation\nhinge upon reducing the numerator by factors present in the denominator or by use of the\nsimple identity:\n(K.1)\n\u03b3 {\u03bci \u03b3 \u03bcj } = 0.\nIn the scalar diquark channel, let us take Eq. (5.31) as our starting point. Denote the\npropagators simply by A = (k \u2212 P + \u2206/2)2 \u2212 m2D + i\u03b5, B = (k + \u2206)2 \u2212 m2 + i\u03b5, and C =\nk2 \u2212 m2 + i\u03b5. The DDs in the scalar channel can be deduced without reducing factors in the\nnumerator. We merely introduce two Feynman parameters {x, y} to cast the denominator\nspecifically in the form [xA + yB + (1 \u2212 x \u2212 y)C]2a+1 . One then translates k\u03bc to render the\nintegral hyperspherically symmetric via the definition k\u03bc = l\u03bc + \u03b2P \u03bc \u2212 (\u03b1 + 1)\u2206\u03bc /2.
