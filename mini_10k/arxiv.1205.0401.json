Introduction\nFlory and Orr [11, 23] introduced self-avoiding walk as a simple model of\na polymer. It quickly became clear that the model exhibits rich behaviour\nthe rigorous understanding of which poses a real challenge to mathematicians.\nOriginally, Flory was interested in the typical behaviour of self-avoiding walk,\nand in particular in the mean squared displacement of its endpoint. Since\nthen, much effort has been invested in the study of typical geometric properties of the model.\n1.1. The model and the results. Let d \u2265 2. For u \u2208 Rd , let ||u|| denote\nthe Euclidean norm of u. Let E(Zd ) denote the set of nearest-neighbour bonds\nof the integer lattice Zd . A walk of length n \u2208 N is a map \u03b3 : {0, . . . , n} \u2192 Zd\nsuch that (\u03b3i , \u03b3i+1 ) \u2208 E(Zd ) for each i \u2208 {0, . . . , n \u2212 1}. An injective walk\nis called self-avoiding. Let SAWn denote the set of self-avoiding walks of\nlength n that start at 0 and let PSAWn denote the uniform law on SAWn .\nThis article is devoted to proving that self-avoiding walk is sub-ballistic:\nTheorem 1.1. Let v > 0. There exists \u03b5 > 0 such that, for each n \u2208 N,\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\b\nPSAW n max ||\u03b3k || : 0 \u2264 k \u2264 n \u2265 vn \u2264 e\u2212\u03b5n .\nThe theorem has the following immediate consequence.\nP\n1\n2\nCorollary 1.2.

Conjectures on the mean-square displacement. Numerical computations and non-rigorous theory predict the precise behaviour of the meansquared displacement of the walk's endpoint. It is conjectured that\n\nh||\u03b3n ||2 i = n2\u03bd+o(1)\n\n\uf8f1\n1\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f23/4\nwhere \u03bd = \u2248 0.59 * * *\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n1/2\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n1/2\n\nd=1\nd=2\nd=3\nd=4\nd \u2265 5.\n\nThe behaviour predicted by this conjecture should be compared to that\nof simple random walk. In general, the displacement of the endpoint of\nself-avoiding walk is expected to exceed that of simple random walk. In\ndimensions two and three, this difference is manifested in a strong form, with\nthe value of \u03bd in the self-avoiding case exceeding its counterpart for the simple\none (which is 1/2). Dimension four is known as the upper critical dimension:\nhere, the two values of \u03bd coincide, with self-avoiding walk experiencing further\ndisplacement in the form of a poly-logarithmic correction. In dimensions five\nand higher, the two values coincide and no logarithmic corrections occur;\nindeed, the scaling limit of each process is Brownian motion. However, the\ndiffusion rates of the Brownian motions in the simple random walk and selfavoiding walk scaling limits differ, with the rate being higher in the selfavoiding case.\nIn dimensions five and above, the conjecture was proved for a version of\nself-avoiding walk with weak repulsion in Brydges and Spencer [6]. Hara and\nSlade [13, 14] proved the conjecture for self-avoiding walk and established\nthat this process has Brownian motion as a scaling limit in these dimensions.\nRigorous analysis in dimension four is much more subtle. Recently some\nimpressive results have been achieved using a supersymmetric renormalization group approach. These results concern continuous-time weakly selfavoiding walk: see [4, 5, 2] and references within.\nAs far as we know, no significant physical predictions have been made\nregarding the scaling limit of self-avoiding walk in three dimensions. In dimension two, the Coulomb gas formalism [21, 22] provides the prediction that\n\u03bd = 3/4, with this prediction later being made [9, 10] using conformal field\ntheory. The scaling limit of the model in this dimension has been identified [18] subject to certain assumptions principal among which is conformal\ninvariance: given that the scaling limit may be expected to be supported\non simple curves and to enjoy a natural restriction property, the assumption\nof a certain conformal covariance forces the limit to be given by SchrammLoewner Evolution with parameter \u03ba = 8/3.\n\n\fSELF-AVOIDING WALK IS SUB-BALLISTIC\n\n3\n\nb\n\nO\u03b4\n\na\n\nFigure 1. The path \u03b3\u03b4 in (O\u03b4 , a\u03b4 , b\u03b4 ).\nThere are however very few rigorous unconditional results regarding dimensions two and three. The question of a non-trivial upper bound on meansquared endpoint displacement is raised in the introduction of [19]. That the\nintuitively very natural assertion that self-avoiding walk in dimensions two\nand three is sub-ballistic has remained unresolved for a long time is one of\nseveral archetypical examples which bear witness to the theoretical difficulty\nthat this model presents in the low-dimensional case.\n1.3. Self-avoiding walk between two points of a domain. The selfavoiding walk model exhibits a phase transition when defined slightly differently. Let O be a simply connected smooth domain in Rd with two points\na, b on the boundary. For \u03b4 > 0, let O\u03b4 be the largest connected component\nof O \u2229 \u03b4Zd and let a\u03b4 , b\u03b4 be the two sites of O\u03b4 closest to a and b respectively.\nWe think of (O\u03b4 , a\u03b4 , b\u03b4 ) as being an approximation of (O, a, b); see Figure 1.\nLet z > 0. On (O\u03b4 , a\u03b4 , b\u03b4 ), define a probability measure on the finite set of\nself-avoiding walks in O\u03b4 from a\u03b4 to b\u03b4 by the formula\n(1.1)\n\nP(O\u03b4 ,a\u03b4 ,b\u03b4 ,z) (\u03b3\u03b4 ) =\n\nz |\u03b3\u03b4 |\n\nZ(O\u03b4 ,a\u03b4 ,b\u03b4 ) (z)\n\n,\n\nwhere |\u03b3\u03b4 | is the length of \u03b3\u03b4 , and Z(O\u03b4 ,a\u03b4 ,b\u03b4 ) (z) is a normalizing factor.\nA phase transition occurs at the value \u03bc\u22121\nc , where \u03bcc is the connective\nconstant (whose definition we will shortly provide). For z < \u03bc\u22121\nc , there\nexists C = C(z) > 0 such that P(O\u03b4 ,a\u03b4 ,b\u03b4 ,z)\u221a\n(|\u03b3\u03b4 | \u2264 C/\u03b4) \u2192 1 as \u03b4 \u0581 0. In\nfact, \u03b3\u03b4 has Gaussian fluctuation of order \u03b4 around the geodesic between\na and b in O (assuming the geodesic is unique - otherwise some changes\nare needed). Broadly, these results may be expected to be a consequence\n\n\f4\n\nH. DUMINIL-COPIN AND A. HAMMOND\n\nof the theory developed by Ioffe [15] that treats unrestricted self-avoiding\nwalk in Zd ; however, they have not been rigorously derived to the best of our\nknowledge. For z > \u03bc\u22121\nc , the converse is true [7] in the sense that \u03b3\u03b4 becomes\nspace-filling.\nViewed in this light, Theorem 1.1 rules out the possibility that the model's\ncritical behaviour coincides with that of the subcritical phase z < \u03bc\u22121\nc :\nCorollary 1.3. Let (O, a, b) be such that \u2202O is smooth \u0001in a neighbourhood\n|\u03b3\u03b4 | \u2264 K/\u03b4 \u2192 0 as \u03b4 \u0581 0.\nof a and of b. For every K > 0, P(O\u03b4 ,a\u03b4 ,b\u03b4 ,\u03bc\u22121\nc )\n\n1.4. More general graphs. The proof of Theorem 1.1 can be extended\n(with additional technicalities) to lattices with symmetry. For instance, the\ncase of the hexagonal lattice should follow from the same reasoning. While\nthe question can be asked on any locally-finite infinite transitive graph, the\nanswer will differ drastically depending on the growth of the graph. For\ninstance, it is strongly expected that self-avoiding walk on the Cayley graph\nof a non-amenable group is ballistic (see the upcoming Question 5); see [20]\nfor a study of some hyperbolic planar graphs.\nIn [3] is considered a model where a walk \u03b3 \u2208 SAWn is chosen with weight\nQ\nN\nN\nproportional to di=1 zi,+i,+ zi,\u2212i,\u2212 where Ni,+/\u2212 is the number of increasing or\ndecreasing steps made by \u03b3 in direction ei and zi,+/\u2212 \u2208 (0, \u221e) are parameters.\nIn the asymmetric case that zi,+ 6= zi,\u2212 for some i \u2208 [1, d] (and no zj,+/\u2212 = 0),\n[3, Theorem 1.2] is a result to the effect that the walk is typically ballistic.\n1.5. Open problems. Theorem 1.1 is a first step towards proving the conjecture on mean-squared displacement. An interesting improvement would\nbe a quantitative bound:\nQuestion 1. Show that for some \u03b5 > 0, limn\u2192\u221e n\u2212(2\u2212\u03b5) h||\u03b3n||2 i = 0.\nTheorem 1.1 raises the prospect of confirming that the walk from the lowerleft to upper-right corner of a square sways to macroscopic distance from the\ndiagonal, but it does not resolve this question:\nQuestion 2. Fix (O, a, b). Show that \u03b3\u03b4 does not converge to a geodesic.\nThe theorem rules out the extreme of fast movement by the walk. What\nabout the other extreme? Does self-avoiding walk move further than simple\nrandom walk?\nQuestion 3. Show that lim inf n\u2192\u221e n\u22121 h||\u03b3n ||2 i > 0.\nIn fact, far slower motion by self-avoiding walk has yet to be ruled out. In\nprinciple, the walk may be space-filling:\nQuestion 4. Show that limn\u2192\u221e n\u22122/d h||\u03b3n ||2 i = \u221e.\n\n\fSELF-AVOIDING WALK IS SUB-BALLISTIC\n\n5\n\nAs we have mentioned, the question of ballisticity may be posed for selfavoiding walk on many transitive graphs, such as Cayley graphs. Let G be\na finitely generated infinite group and let S be a finite symmetric system of\ngenerators. Let GG,S be the Cayley graph associated to (G, S).\nQuestion 5. Is self-avoiding walk ballistic whenever simple random walk is?\nIn particular, is the model ballistic if G is non-amenable?\n1.6. Acknowledgments.

The symbol N denotes the set of integers {0, 1, 2, 3, . . .}. We\nset [a, b] = {a, a + 1, . . . , b}.\nFor u \u2208 Rd , we write u = (u1 , . . . , ud). We also write x(u) = u1 and\ny(u) = u2 . For k \u2208 [1, d], let ek be the vector of Euclidean norm one whose k th\nentry is 1. As we tend to visualise our constructions for the two-dimensional\ncase, we will sometimes refer to the directions e1 and e2 as east and north.\nThe cardinality of a finite set A is denoted by |A|. Abusing slightly this\nnotation, the length of a walk \u03b3 will be denoted by |\u03b3|; recall that |\u03b3| is the\nnumber of edges (rather than the number of vertices) comprising \u03b3.\nFor m, n \u2208 N, let \u03b3 and \u03b3\u0303 be two walks of lengths m and n, neither of\nwhich need to start at 0. The concatenation \u03b3 \u25e6 \u03b3\u0303 of \u03b3 and \u03b3\u0303 is given by\n(\n\u0001\n\u03b3k\nk \u2264 m,\n\u0001\n\u03b3 \u25e6 \u03b3\u0303 k =\n\u03b3m + \u03b3\u0303k\u2212m \u2212 \u03b3\u03030 m + 1 \u2264 k \u2264 m + n .\n\nLet A and B be two sets. Let P(B) denote the power-set of a set B. A\nmulti-valued map from A to B is a function f : A \u2192 P(B). We will use such\nmaps in order to estimate the size of sets. On several occasions, we will use\nthe following basic principle, which we name for future reference:\nMulti-valued map principle. Let f be a multi-valued map from A to B.\nWrite f \u22121 (b) := {a \u2208 A : b \u2208 f (a)}. Then\n|A| \u2264\n\nmaxb\u2208B |f \u22121(b)|\n* |B| .\nmina\u2208A |f (a)|\n\n\f6\n\nH. DUMINIL-COPIN AND A. HAMMOND\n\n2.2. Bridges. Recall the classical definition of a bridge. A self-avoiding walk\nis called a self-avoiding bridge if\n\u2022 its first element attains uniquely the minimal y-coordinate on the\nwalk;\n\u2022 and its final element attains, not necessarily uniquely, the maximal\ny-coordinate on the walk.\nThe self-avoiding walk being the object of attention, we will usually omit\nthe term \"self-avoiding\" in referring to walks and bridges. For n \u2208 N, let\nSABn and SAWn denote the set of bridges and walks of length n. Let SAW\nand SAB be the corresponding sets where now no condition on the length is\napplied. Let PSABn and PSAWn denote the uniform law on SABn and SAWn .\n\nFigure 2. On the left, a bridge with its renewal points.\nOn the right, a bridge with its diamond points (which we will\nshortly discuss).\nWe begin by recording a straightforward statement concerning the number of bridges of length n. Recall from [12] that a standard subadditive\nargument assures the existence of the connective constant \u03bcc , given by \u03bcc =\n1/n\n\u2208 (0, \u221e). (See [8] for a rigorous identification of \u03bcc 's value\nlimn SAWn\nfor the hexagonal lattice.)\nProposition 2.1. The generating functions of walks and bridges satisfy\n\u0010 X\n\u0011\nX\n|\u03b3|\n\u22121\n|\u03b3|\n(2.1)\nz \u2264 z exp 2\nz \u22122 .\n\u03b3\u2208SAW\n\n\u03b3\u2208SAB\n\nFurthermore, there exists C > 0 such that, for each n \u2208 N,\n(2.2)\n\ne\u2212C\n\n\u221a\n\nn\n\n|SAWn | \u2264 |SABn | \u2264 |SAWn | .\n\n\fSELF-AVOIDING WALK IS SUB-BALLISTIC\n\n7\n\nIn a classic argument of Hammersley and Welsh [12], (2.2) is demonstrated\nby the construction of a map from SAWn and\u221aSABn enjoying the property\nthat each preimage has cardinality at most eC n ; formally, then, the multivalued map principle (applied in this case to single-valued maps) yields (2.2).\nIn fact, the techniques imply (2.1): see [19, (3.1.13)].\nThe notion of cutting an object into irreducible pieces has been much used,\nlargely because it is crucial for developing a renewal theory. This theory was\ndeveloped for bridges in [16, 17]. The set R\u03b3 of renewal points of \u03b3 \u2208 SABn is\nthe set of points of the form \u03b3i with i \u2208 [0, n], for which \u03b3[0, i] and \u03b3[i, n] are\nbridges. See Figure 2. A bridge \u03b3 \u2208 SABn with n \u2265 1 is said to be irreducible\nif \u03b3k is not a renewal point for any k \u2208 [1, n \u2212 1].\nLet iSAB be the set of irreducible bridges of arbitrary length whose initial\npoint is 0. Every bridge is the concatenation of a finite number of irreducible\nelements; the decomposition is unique and the set R\u03b3 is the union of the\ninitial and terminal points of the bridges that comprise this decomposition.\nThis leads to the following result due to Kesten.\nX\nLemma 2.2 (Kesten). We have that\n\u03bc\u2212|\u03b3|\n= 1.\nc\n\u03b3\u2208iSAB\n\nProof. Since the argument is short, we provide it here. The decomposition\nof walks into irreducible bridges yields\nX\n1\nP\nz |\u03b3| =\n1 \u2212 \u03b3\u2208iSAB z |\u03b3|\n\u03b3\u2208SAB\n\nfor every z such that the two series converge. Proposition 2.1 shows that\n\u22121\nthe radius of convergence of the series on the left-hand side\nP is \u03bcc .|\u03b3| The\n\u22121\ngenerating function does not blow up for z < \u03bcc , and thus \u03b3\u2208iSAB z < 1\nP\n\u2212|\u03b3|\nfor any z < \u03bc\u22121\n\u2264 1 follows by means of the monotone\nc , whence\n\u03b3\u2208iSAB \u03bcc\nconvergence theorem.\nP\nFurthermore, this sum will equal one if \u03b3\u2208SAB z |\u03b3| diverges as z tends to\nP\nP\n|\u03b3|\n|\u03b3|\n\u03bc\u22121\ndiverges as z \u0580 \u03bc\u22121\ndic . But (2.1) shows that\nc if\n\u03b3\u2208SAB z\n\u03b3\u2208SAW z\nverges in this limit. Divergence of the latter sum follows from |SAWn | \u2265\n\u03bcnc , which is a consequence of the submultiplicative bound |SAWn+m | \u2264\n|SAWn ||SAWm |.\n\u0003\nBy means of Lemma 2.2, we define the probability measure PiSAB on iSAB\n\u2212|\u03b3|\nby setting PiSAB (\u03b3) = \u03bcc .\n2.3. Statements and sketches of the proofs of the main elements.\nWe will prove Theorem 1.1 by contradiction. We might argue instead by\nconditioning but the further notation required would be substantial.\n\n\f8\n\nH. DUMINIL-COPIN AND A. HAMMOND\n\nWe first work with bridges. We record the assumption whose negation we\nseek to prove by contradiction; when a result requires the assumption, we\nwill say so in its statement.\nBallistic assumption. Suppose that for some v > 0,\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u22121\nlim sup n log PSABn y(\u03b3n) \u2265 vn = 0 .\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nWe first prove that, under the ballistic assumption, the probability that a\nbridge possesses a positive density of renewal points decays subexponentially.\nMore precisely:\nTheorem 2.3. Suppose that the ballistic assumption holds. Then there exists\n\u03b4 > 0 such that\n\u0001\nlim sup n\u22121 log PSABn |R\u03b3 | \u2265 \u03b4n = 0 .\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nWhile its statement is very intuitive, the proof of this result contains some\nof the central ideas of this paper. The fact that self-avoiding walk is not\nMarkovian makes the study delicate. The argument begins by noting that, if\na bridge travels ballistically in the northerly direction, many sets of the form\n{u \u2208 Zd : y(u) = h} are visited on at most a few occasions. We then use\nunfoldings in order to prove that, by paying a subexponential cost, many of\nthese sets are in fact visited only once.\nWe will see that the macroscopic presence of such renewal points at subexponential cost implies the stronger statement that bridges typically have a\npositive density of renewal points, or, in other words, that the average size\nof an irreducible bridge is finite.\nCorollary 2.4. Supposing the ballistic assumption, EiSAB (|\u03b3|) < \u221e.\nAn independent argument rules out this possibility.\n\nTheorem 2.5. We have that EiSAB (|\u03b3|) = \u221e.\nWe now explain roughly how we will prove Theorem 2.5. Seeking a contradiction, we assume that EiSAB (|\u03b3|) < \u221e.\nd\nLet P\u2297N\niSAB denote the law on semi-infinite walks \u03b3 : N \u2192 Z formed by the\nconcatenation of infinitely many independent samples of PiSAB . This measure\nmay be viewed heuristically as the law of a semi-infinite self-avoiding walk\nconditioned to remain in the upper-half plane. See [19, Section 8.3] for further\ndiscussion about P\u2297N\niSAB .\nOur assumption that the irreducible renewal block has finite mean length\nmeans that we may invoke the law of large numbers to conclude that, under\nthe law P\u2297N\nnorthwards at a constant rate \u03bd \u2208 (0, 1), so\niSAB , the walk \u03b3 proceeds\n\u0001\nthat y(\u03b3n ) = \u03bdn 1 + on\u2192\u221e (1) as n \u2192 \u221e. However, for a typical sample \u03b3 of\n\n\fSELF-AVOIDING WALK IS SUB-BALLISTIC\n\n9\n\nP\u2297N\niSAB , the interval [0, \u03bdn] is populated to positive density by renewal points;\nthere are thus an order of n2 pairs of renewal points such that each element\nof the pair has y-coordinate in this interval and where the distance between\nthe two points is at least a small constant multiple of n. Writing (r, r \u2032 ) for\nthe indices of such a pair of renewal points, we may perform a surgery on\n\u03b3, rotating \u03b3[r,\u221e) clockwise about \u03b3r by a right-angle, advancing along the\nnew curve to the image of \u03b3r\u2032 , and then rotating the subsequent trajectory\ncounterclockwise by a right-angle about the encountered point, so that the\naltered curve again points in the northerly direction. The new curve thus\nproceeds northwards, then turns eastward for at least small positive multiple\nof n steps, before returning northward. To a typical sample of P\u2297N\niSAB we thus\nassociate an order of n2 alternative walks. To each alternative walk, there\nare at most order n2 candidates for the original walk to which surgery was\napplied: indeed, to perform this reconstruction, it is enough to find each of\nthe renewal point indices r and r \u2032 , and a factor of at most n is needed for\neach one.\nThus, by an argument in the spirit of the multi-valued map principle, were\nall such alternative walks self-avoiding, they would have a P\u2297N\niSAB -probability\nwhich is bounded away from zero uniformly in n. However, alternative walks\nreach y-coordinate \u03bdn after a number of steps which exceeds a multiple\nof n where the factor is a constant which strictly exceeds one; this is in\ncontradiction to y(\u03b3n ) = n(1 + on\u2192\u221e (1)) ensured by the assumption that\nEiSAB (|\u03b3|) < \u221e. This is an outline of an argument to arrive at a contradiction which would prove Theorem 2.5.\nThe difficulty with the plan is that our notion of renewal point is not\nsufficient to ensure that right-angle rotation about a renewal point of the path\nsubsequent to that point results in a self-avoiding walk. Thus we introduce a\nstronger notion of renewal point for which this property is (in essence) valid.\nThe point \u03b3i is a diamond point of \u03b3 if\n\u2022 for any j \u2265 i, (x + y)(\u03b3j ) \u2265 (x + y)(\u03b3i ) and (y \u2212 x)(\u03b3j ) \u2265 (y \u2212 x)(\u03b3i ),\n\u2022 for any j \u2264 i, (x + y)(\u03b3j ) \u2264 (x + y)(\u03b3i ) and (y \u2212 x)(\u03b3j ) \u2264 (y \u2212 x)(\u03b3i ).\nNote that a diamond point is indeed a renewal point.\nTo implement our plan using diamond points in place of renewal points, we\nwill first prove that, if EiSAB (|\u03b3|) < \u221e, then a positive proportion of renewal\npoints are in fact diamond points, so that the latter points also populate\nthe y-coordinate to positive density. Our operation of turning the curve first\nclockwise and then counterclockwise again at appropriate diamond points will\nbe called the stickbreak operation and is illustrated in Figure 3. Stickbreak\nnow produces self-avoiding outputs and this allows us to derive the sought\ncontradiction.\n\n\f10\n\nH. DUMINIL-COPIN AND A. HAMMOND\n\nFigure 3. The stickbreak operation is depicted. Note the two\neast-west edges, depicted in bold, that are inserted at either end\nof the rotated section in order to ensure that the outcome of\nthe operation is self-avoiding.\n2.4. Deducing Theorem 1.1. Here, we apply Corollary 2.4 and Theorem 2.5 to obtain Theorem 1.1.\nProof of Theorem 1.1. By the axial symmetry of the law PSAWn , note that\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\b\nPSAWn max ||\u03b3k || : 0 \u2264 k \u2264 n \u2265 vn\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\b\n\u22121/2\nvn .\n\u2264 2dPSAWn max y(\u03b3k ) : 0 \u2264 k \u2264 n \u2265 d\n\nWe apply the classical unfolding operation from \b\nwalks into bridges (see\n[19, Section 3.1]) to walks \u03b3\b\u2208 SAWn verifying max y(\u03b3k ) : 0 \u2264 k \u2264 n \u2265\nd\u22121/2 vn. Noting that max y(\u03b3k ) : 0 \u2264 k \u2264 n increases at each step,\nand that the outcome of the unfolding, being an element of SABn , has the\nproperty that this maximum is attained by k = n, we learn that\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u221a\n1 \u2212C n\ne\nPSAWn ||\u03b3n || \u2265 vn .\nPSABn y(\u03b3n ) \u2265 d\u22121/2 vn \u2265 2d\nTherefore, if the conclusion of Theorem 1.1 is violated, the ballistic assumption must be verified. Corollary 2.4 then contradicts Theorem 2.5.\n\u0003\n\n\fSELF-AVOIDING WALK IS SUB-BALLISTIC\n\n11\n\n2.5. Structure of the paper. Section 3 contains the proofs of Theorem 2.3\nand Corollary 2.4. In Section 4, Theorem 2.5 is proved. The final Section 5\nis devoted to the proof of the corollaries.\n3. Positive density of renewal points\nat subexponential cost\nIn this section, we prove Theorem 2.3.

For \u03b3 \u2208 SAWn , define\nthe h-visiting edge-set Vh,h+1 by Vh,h+1(\u03b3) = Eh \u2229 {(\u03b3i , \u03b3i+1 ) : 0 \u2264 i \u2264 n \u2212 1 .\nLet \u03b4 > 0. For m \u2265 1, write SABm\nn,v,\u03b4 \u2286 SABn,v for the set of \u03b3 \u2208 SABn,v\nsuch that there are at \bleast \u03b4n values of h \u2208 Z for which |Vh,h+1| \u2264 m.\nNote that SAB1n,v,\u03b4 \u2286 \u03b3 \u2208 SABn : |R\u03b3 | \u2265 \u03b4n since if a walk \u03b3 crosses\nfrom Eh to Eh+1 only at (\u03b3i , \u03b3i+1 ), then \u03b3i is a renewal point. Thus, to\nderive Theorem 3.1, we may argue that SAB1n,v,\u03b4 is not too small with respect\nto SABn,v . The next proposition is the main technical result used in this\ndeduction. It shows that, judged on an exponential scale and along a suitable\nk\u22121\n\u2032\nsubsequence, the sets SABkn,v,\u03b4 and SABn,v,\u03b4\n\u2032 have the same size if \u03b4 \u226a \u03b4.\n\b\nProposition 3.2. Let v > 0. Let k \u2265 2. Let \u03b4 > 0 and un\b : n \u2208 N be a\nsubsequence\nof N.

We claim that\n(3.2)\n\n\u23082/v\u2309\n\nSABn,v \u2286 SABn,v,v/2 .\n\nTo verify this, note that \u03b3 \u2208 SABn,v implies that Vh,h+1 6= \u2205 for at least vn\nvalues of h \u2208 Z. Among these values, |Vh,h+1| can be larger than 2/v on at\nmost vn/2 occasions. Thus, (3.2) holds.\n\n\f12\n\nH. DUMINIL-COPIN AND A. HAMMOND\n\nBy (3.2), we may successively apply Proposition 3.2 with k being set equal\nto \u23082/v\u2309, \u23082/v\u2309 \u2212 1, . . . , 3 and 2 to conclude\nthat, for\bany given v > 0, there\n\b\nexists some\nN and some\n\b \u03b4 > 0, some subsequence vn : n \u2208 N of 1 un : n \u2208\u2212\u03b5\nsequence \u03b5n : n \u2208 N with \u03b5n \u0581 0 such that |SABvn ,v,\u03b4 | \u2265 e n n |SABvn ,v |.\nHowever, if Vh,h+1 has only one element e, then\n\b the endpoint u of e with\n1\ny(u) = h belongs to R\u03b3 , so that SABvn ,v,\u03b4 \u2286 \u03b3 \u2208 SABvn ,v : |R\u03b3 | \u2265 \u03b4vn ,\nwhence follows the theorem.\n\u0003\nWe now introduce a concept which plays a central role in the proof of\nProposition 3.2. Figure 4 provides an illustration.\nLet \u03b3 \u2208 SABn . A zigzag of \u03b3 is a pair (i, j) of indices belonging to {0, . . . , n}\nthat satisfy i \u2264 j and for which\n\u2022 the largest of the values k at which the maximum of y(\u03b3k ) over 1 \u2264\nk \u2264 j is achieved equals i, and\n\u2022 the largest of the values k at which the minimum of y(\u03b3k ) over i \u2264\nk \u2264 n is achieved equals j.\nLet ZigZag = ZigZag(\u03b3) denote the set of zigzags of \u03b3. For (i, j) \u2208 ZigZag, we\ncall the image of the subwalk \u03b3[i,j] the central section of (i, j); by the length\nof this central section, we mean the length of \u03b3[i,j], which is j \u2212 i. The indices\ni and j are respectively called the point of zig and the point of zag of (i, j).\nThe following basic properties of the zigzags of a bridge are readily verified.\nLemma 3.3. Let \u03b3 \u2208 SABn .\n(1) The central sections of the zigzags of \u03b3 are pairwise disjoint.\n(2) If (i, i) \u2208 ZigZag, then \u03b3i \u2208 R\u03b3 .\n\nWe now describe a one-step operation which acts on a bridge and unfolds\na given zigzag. To do so, for v \u2208 Rd , we let Rv \b\n: Rd \u2192 Rd denote the\northogonal reflection with respect to the hyperplane u \u2208 Rd : y(u) = y(v) .\nDefinition 3.4. For \u03b3 \u2208 SABn and\u0001 (i, j) \u2208 ZigZag, let Unf i,j (\u03b3) \u2208 SABn be\ngiven by Unf i,j (\u03b3) = \u03b3[0,i] \u25e6 R\u03b3i \u03b3[i,j] \u25e6 \u03b3[j,n].\n\nLemma 3.5. Let \u03b3 \u2208 SABn .\n(1) Let (i, j) \u2208 ZigZag. Then \u03b3i and Unf (i,j) (\u03b3)j each belong to RUnf (i,j) (\u03b3) .\n\u0001\n(2) Let (i, j) \u2208 ZigZag.

Then Unf z2 Unf z1 (\u03b3) = Unf z1 Unf z2 (\u03b3).\n\nThe proof of Lemma 3.5 is straightforward and omitted. Lemma 3.5(3)\nshows that the order of application of the maps Unf z is immaterial. This\npermits us to extend the action of Unf so that several zigzags are undone at\nonce.\n\nDefinition 3.6. Let \u03b3 \u2208 SABn and Z \u2286 ZigZag. Set Unf Z (\u03b3) \u2208 SABn equal\nto the bridge obtained by iteratively applying to \u03b3 the maps Unf z for z \u2208 Z.\n\n\fSELF-AVOIDING WALK IS SUB-BALLISTIC\n\n13\n\nFigure 4. In the left-hand sketch, an element of SABn and\none of its zigzags is illustrated. The zigzag's central section\nis shown in red and the points of zig and of zag are marked\nby dots. The unfolding of the walk indexed by this zigzag is\ndepicted on the right.\nWe finish these preliminaries with a trivial lemma.\nLemma 3.7. Let \u03b3 \u2208 SABn and Z \u2286 ZigZag. Then Unf Z (\u03b3) \u2208 SABn and\ny(Unf Z (\u03b3)n ) \u2265 y(\u03b3n ).\nWe are now in a position to prove Proposition 3.2.\nProof of Proposition 3.2. The proof is presented as a study of three\ncases. The walks in SABkvn ,v,\u03b4 are divided into the three following types, and\nthe respective cases consider the event that walks of the given type form a\npositive proportion of SABkvn ,v,\u03b4 :\n(1) Many renewal points: walks with a positive proportion of renewal\npoints are common, and there is nothing to prove;\n(2) Few zigzags: walks with few zigzags are common; here, we unfold\nall zigzags at subexponential cost, thereby reducing the cardinality of\nVh,h+1 for all levels h for which |Vh,h+1| is not already one;\n(3) Many zigzags and few renewal points: if such walks as these are\ncommon, we unfold a collection of short zigzags of such a walk, the\nnumber of unfolded zigzags being both a tiny proportion of all zigzags\n\n\f14\n\nH.

Thus, the multi-valued map principle\nshows that image walks, which contain many renewal points because\nsuch points are generated wherever unfoldings of zigzags were made,\nare far more numerous than the preimage walks (which are common\nby assumption in this case). In spirit, this aspect of the argument\nhas similarities to Kesten's proof [16] of the pattern theorem for selfavoiding walk.\nCase 1: many\nSuppose that there exists \u03b4 \u2032 > 0 and a\n\b renewal points.\n\b\nsubsequence vn : n \u2208 N of un : n \u2208 N such that, for each n \u2208 N,\nn\no\nk\n\u2032\n\u03b3 \u2208 SABvn ,v,\u03b4 : |R\u03b3 | \u2265 \u03b4 vn \u2265 41 SABkvn ,v,\u03b4 .\n\nIf \u03b3 \u2208 SAWn and \u03b3i \u2208 R\u03b3 for some 0 \u2264 i \u2264 n \u2212 1, note that |Vh,h+1| = 1\nfor h = y(\u03b3i).

Let \u03c6 \u2208\nMultiUnf(\u03b3) for some \u03b3 \u2208 ManyZFewR. We claim that\n(3.9)\n\n|R\u03c6 | \u2264 \u03b5n vn + 3\u23081/\u03b4 \u2032\u2309\u03b4 \u2032\u2032 vn .\n\nIndeed, |R\u03b3 | \u2264 \u03b5n vn by assumption. Furthermore, the number of newly\ncreated renewal points is bounded above by 3\u23081/\u03b4 \u2032 \u2309\u03b4 \u2032\u2032 vn . Indeed, let Z \u2286\nZigZag\u03b3 be such that \u03c6 = Unf Z (\u03b3). Consider a single unfolding operation\nUnf (i,j) applied to a walk \u03c7 (so that (i, j) \u2208 ZigZag\u03c7 ). Note that in the\nhyperplane given by y < y(\u03c7j ), Unf (i,j) (\u03c7) coincides with \u03c7, while the \u0001intersection of Unf (i,j) (\u03c7) with the hyperplane y > y(\u03c7i ) + 2 y(\u03c7i ) \u2212 y(\u03c7j ) is\nmerely a translate of the intersection with \u03c7 with y > y(\u03c7i ). As such, renewal\npoints in Unf (i,j) (\u03c7) either lie in one of these two hyperplanes, in which case,\nthey have counterparts in \u03c7, or they lie in the slab given by the complement\n\u0001\nof the union of the hyperplanes. This slab has width 3 y(\u03c7i ) \u2212 y(\u03c7j ) , which\nis at most three times the length j \u2212 i of the central section of (i, j). We see\nthen that the number of renewal points for Unf (i,j) (\u03c7) exceeds this number for\n\u03c7 by at most 3(j \u2212i). From j \u2212i \u2264 \u23081/\u03b4 \u2032 \u2309, we verify that the number of newly\ncreated renewal points satisfies the bound we claimed. From |Z| = \u03b4 \u2032\u2032 n, we\nobtain (3.9).\nSuppose given \u03c6 = Unf Z (\u03b3) for some unknown \u03b3 \u2208 ManyZFewR and\nfor some unknown subset Z \u2286 ShortZZ\u03b3 such that |Z| = \u03b4 \u2032\u2032 n. Recalling\nLemma 3.5, the data \u03b3 may be reconstructed from \u03c6 provided that the |Z|\npairs of points corresponding to the points of zig and of zag generated by\nthe successive unfoldings of elements of Z are known. Also note that given a\ncertain point i assumed to be the point of zig of some (i, j) \u2208 Z, then j \u2212 i\nis the length of the central section and therefore i \u2264 j \u2264 i + \u23081/\u03b4 \u2032 \u2309. For this\nreason, the number of possibilities for the point of zag given the point of zig\nis bounded by \u23081/\u03b4 \u2032 \u2309.\nHence, the number of pairs (\u03b3, Z) such that Unf Z (\u03b3) = \u03c6 is at most the\n\u2032\u2032\nproduct of the number of subsets of R\u03c6 of size \u03b4 \u2032\u2032 n and the quantity \u23081/\u03b4 \u2032 \u2309\u03b4 n ,\nthe first factor counting possible values of the set of points of zig of Z and\nthe second counting such values for the set of points of zag.

Let \u03a9 be the set of\nbi-infinite walks \u03b3 : Z \u2192 Zd such that \u03b30 = 0. Let P\u2297Z\niSAB denote the law\non \u03a9 formed from P\u2297N\nby\niteratively\ninserting\ninfinitely\nmany independent\niSAB\nsamples of PiSAB so that the terminal point of the newly inserted renewal\n\n\fSELF-AVOIDING WALK IS SUB-BALLISTIC\n\n19\n\nblock is the starting point of the walk that is presently formed. Let F be\nthe \u03c3-algebra generated by events depending on a finite number of vertices\nof the walk.\nWe begin by describing a few properties of the measure P\u2297Z\niSAB . Let r be\nthe bi-infinite sequence of integers defined by r0 = 0 and rk+1 = inf{j >\nrk : \u03b3j \u2208 R\u03b3 } for each k \u2208 Z. That is, for k 6= 0, rk is the index of the\n|k|th renewal point, counted northwards or southwards away from the origin\naccording to the sign of k. Let \u03c4 : \u03a9 \u2192 \u03a9 be the shift defined by the formula\n\u03c4 (\u03b3)i = \u03b3i+r1 \u2212 \u03b3r1 for every i \u2208 Z. Let \u03c3 denote reflection in the hyperplane\n{u \u2208 Rd : y(u) = 0}.\nLemma 4.1. The measure P\u2297Z\niSAB has the following properties.\n(1) It is invariant under the shift \u03c4 .\n(2) The shift \u03c4 is ergodic for (\u03a9, F , P\u2297Z\niSAB ).\n(3) Under P\u2297Z\n,\nthe\nrandom\nvariables\n(\u03c3\u03b3n )n\u22640 and (\u03b3n \u2212 \u03b31 )n\u22651 are\niSAB\nindependent and identically distributed.\nProof. Part (1) is fairly straightforward. Indeed, the law of \u03b3[r\u2212n,rn ] determines, in the high-n limit, the law of \u03b3 since we work with the \u03c3-algebra F .\nNow, the laws of \u03c4 (\u03b3[r\u2212n\u22121 ,rn\u22121 ] ) and \u03b3[r\u2212n,rn ] are the same by construction (the\ncommon law is simply the law of 2n consecutively concatenated independent\nirreducible bridges). The claim follows by letting n \u2192 \u221e.\nPart (2) is classical. Let A be a shift-invariant event. We aim to prove that\n\u2208 {0, 1}.

DUMINIL-COPIN AND A. HAMMOND\n\nPart (3) follows from an explicit construction of the law P\u2297Z\niSAB which emphasises its near symmetry under \u03c3. Noting that any bridge begins by making\na move to the north, let P\u2217iSAB denote the law on SAW formed by removing the\nfirst edge of the walk and translating the resulting subwalk one unit southwards. Note that the support of P\u2217iSAB includes the trivial walk of length zero.\n\u2212|\u03b3|\u22121\nNote also that P\u2217iSAB assigns probability \u03bcc\nto all \u03b3 (of positive length)\nhaving the property that \u03b3 visits only y-coordinates comprised between the\ny-coordinates of its starting and ending points, and no such y-coordinate is\nvisited exactly once; the residue \u03bc\u22121\nc of the probability is assigned to the trivial walk. From this description of P\u2217iSAB , it is clear that this law is invariant\nunder application of \u03c3 (and the necessary translation).\nAs such, P\u2297Z\niSAB may be constructed as follows. First a north-going edge is\nplaced incident to the origin. An element of P\u2217iSAB is then concatenated to its\nnortherly endpoint. The construction is then iterated. To build the walk in\nthe southerly direction, independent elements of P\u2217iSAB and north-south edges\nare alternately joined so that the terminal point of each is the initial point of\nthe presently constructed walk. The invariance of P\u2217iSAB under \u03c3 shows that\nthe two random variables in part(3) each have the law of the concatenation\nof the sequences formed alternately by independent elements of P\u2217iSAB and\nnorth-south edges.\n\u0003\nRecall the notion of diamond point from Section 2.3. As we explained in\nthe sketch in that section, our goal is now to prove that under the assumption\nthat EiSAB (|\u03b3|) < \u221e, a positive density of renewal points are in fact diamond\npoints. Let D\u03b3 be the set of diamond points of \u03b3. Extend the definition of\n\u2297N\n(rk )k\u22650 to PiSAB\n.\nProposition 4.2. If EiSAB (|\u03b3|) < \u221e, there exists \u03b4 > 0 such that\n\u0012\n\u0013\n|D\u03b3 \u2229 [0, rn ]|\n\u2297N\nPiSAB lim inf\n\u2265 \u03b4 = 1.\nn\u2192\u221e\nn\nThat the length of the renewal block has finite mean implies that the\nbridge under P\u2297N\niSAB is tall and narrow, with height growing linearly and width\nsublinearly. So the probability under P\u2297Z\niSAB that the positively (or negatively)\nindexed walk stays within the cone\n\b\nu \u2208 Zd : (x + y)(u), (y \u2212 x)(u) \u2265 0 or (x + y)(u), (y \u2212 x)(u) \u2264 0\n\nis strictly positive. This separation of future and past occurs at a positive\ndensity of renewal points; when it does, the renewal point is actually a diamond point. A little care is needed as we make rigorous this argument.\nProof of Proposition 4.2. Assume EiSAB (|\u03b3|) < \u221e. Let us first prove that\nP\u2297Z\niSAB (\u03b30 \u2208 D\u03b3 ) > 0.\n\n\fSELF-AVOIDING WALK IS SUB-BALLISTIC\n\n21\n\nThe law of an irreducible bridge is invariant under the reflection with respect to the hyperplane {u \u2208 Zd : x(u) = 0}. Therefore, the law of large\nnumbers applied to (x, y)(\u03b3rn ) implies that, P\u2297N\niSAB -almost surely,\n\u0013\n\u0012\nx(\u03b3rn ) y(\u03b3rn )\n\u2212\u2192 (0, \u03bc) as n \u2192 \u221e ,\n(4.1)\n,\nn\nn\n\nwhere \u03bc denotes some strictly positive constant. An irreducible bridge having\nfinite expected size, we deduce that each of inf k\u22650 (x + y)(\u03b3k ) and inf k\u22650 (y \u2212\n\u2297N\nx)(\u03b3k ) is finite P\u2297N\niSAB -almost surely. For l \u2208 N, write \u03c1l for PiSAB -probability\nthat both of these random variables is at least \u2212l, and choose K \u2208 N so that\n\u03c1K > 0.\nWe now claim that\n\u03c10 \u2265 \u03bc\u22122K\n\u03c1K .\nc\n\n(4.2)\n\nTo verify (4.2), consider an experiment under which the law P\u2297N\niSAB is constructed by concatenating 2K independent samples of PiSAB to the terminal\npoint of which is concatenated an independent sample of P\u2297N\niSAB . If each of\nthe 2K samples happens to be a walk of length one (which entails that each\nis a north-south edge) and if the independent copy of P\u2297N\niSAB realizes\n\u0010\n\u0011\nmin inf (x + y)(\u03b3k ) , inf (y \u2212 x)(\u03b3k ) \u2265 \u2212K ,\nk\u22650\n\nk\u22650\n\nthen the constructed sample realizes\n\u0010\n\u0011\nmin inf (x + y)(\u03b3k ) , inf (y \u2212 x)(\u03b3k ) \u2265 0 .\nk\u22650\n\nk\u22650\n\nBy the two assertions of Lemma 3.9, the probability that the ith sample of\nPiSAB is a north-south edge is \u03bc\u22121\nc . Thus, the experiment behaves as described\n\u22122K\nwith probability \u03bcc \u03c1K , and we obtain (4.2).\nFrom (4.2) and Lemma 4.1(3), we deduce that\n\u03b4 := P\u2297Z\niSAB (\u03b30 \u2208 D\u03b3 ) > 0 .\n\nThe shift \u03c4 being ergodic by Lemma 4.1(2), we obtain\n\u0012\n\u0013\n|D\u03b3 \u2229 [0, rn ]|\n\u2297Z\n(4.3)\nPiSAB lim\n= \u03b4 = 1.\nn\u2192\u221e\nn\n\nFrom this, the statement of the proposition follows immediately. The equality \"= \u03b4\" becomes an inequality \"\u2265 \u03b4\" because of the possibility that the\nnegatively indexed semi-infinite bridge under P\u2297Z\niSAB is responsible for destroying diamond points; in fact, it would be simple to argue that (4.3) holds for\nthe law P\u2297N\n\u0003\niSAB , but we have no need of this assertion.\nWe now modify long bridges using the stickbreak operation in order to\nobtain Theorem 2.5.\n\n\f22\n\nH. DUMINIL-COPIN AND A. HAMMOND\n\nProof of Theorem 2.5. The proof entails some interplay between infinite\nand finite bridges: in denoting generic infinite or finite bridges, we write \u03c6\nand \u03b3.\nFor a finite bridge \u03b3, let\n\b\nwidth(\u03b3) = max x(\u03b3i ) \u2212 x(\u03b3j ) : 0 \u2264 i, j \u2264 |\u03b3| .\nThe notion of diamond point may naturally be defined\nalso for finite bridges.\n\b\nWe enumerate \u03b3's successive diamond points as di (\u03b3) : 1 \u2264 i \u2264 |D\u03b3 | .\n\nWe aim to prove that EiSAB (|\u03b3|) = \u221e. We proceed by contradiction. Set\nEiSAB (|\u03b3|) < \u03bd < \u221e and 0 < \u03b5 < \u03b4/20, where \u03b4 is given by Proposition 4.2.\n\nLet \u03a9+ denote the set of semi-infinite bridges, so that \u03c6 \u2208 \u03a9+ whenever\n\u03c6 : N \u2192 Zd is a self-avoiding walk for which y(\u03c6i ) > 0 for i > 0. To\nany (\u03c6, n) \u2208 \u03a9+ \u00d7 N for which rn (\u03c6) exists, associate the truncated bridge\n\u03c6(n) := \u03c6[0,rn(\u03c6)] . Note then that rn (\u03c6) coincides with rn (\u03c6(n) ); we write rn\nfor the common value in what follows. Let SABn = SABn (\u03b5) denote the set\nof \u03c6 \u2208 \u03a9+ such that\n(1) rn \u2264 \u03bdn,\n(2) width(\u03c6(n) ) \u2264 \u03b5n,\n(3) d\u03b4n/2 (\u03c6(n) ) \u2264 rn ,\n\nand note for later use that the data \u03c6(n) determines whether these properties\nhold.\nThese three properties will be important in implementing the stickbreak\noperation which was depicted in Figure 3 as we outlined our approach. We\nnow prove that\n\u0001\n(4.4)\nP\u2297N\niSAB SABn \u2212\u2192 1 as n \u2192 \u221e .\n\nFrom EiSAB (|\u03b3|) < \u03bd < \u221e and EiSAB [x(t\u03b3 )] = 0, where t\u03b3 is the endpoint of\nthe bridge \u03b3, we find that\n\u0010\n\u0011\n(n)\nr\n\u2264\n\u03bdn\nand\nwidth(\u03c6\n)\n\u2264\n\u03b5n\n\u2212\u2192 1\nP\u2297N\nn\niSAB\nthanks to the law of large numbers (which holds since the renewal blocks are\nindependent and identically distributed under P\u2297N\niSAB ). Note that, whenever\n\u03c6(n) has at least i diamond points, we have that di (\u03c6(n) ) \u2264 di (\u03c6), because the\ntruncation operation \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c6(n) can only annihilate (and not create) diamond\npoints.

However, S can be expressed in another\nway, which we now present.\n\u03b4\nFirst note that the width of StickBreaki,j (\u03b3) is larger than 10\nn > \u03b5n (since\nthe height of the rotated piece is larger than its number of diamond points).\nFurthermore, every renewal point of StickBreaki,j (\u03b3) corresponds to a renewal point of \u03b3, except for renewal points possibly created whose index\nlies between di and dj + 2. There are at most width(\u03b3[di ,dj ] ) \u2264 \u03b5n of\n\u03b4\nthem. But at least 10\nn renewal points (in fact even diamond points) were\ndestroyed in the rotation of the central part, so that StickBreaki,j (\u03b3) con\u03b4\ntains at most n + \u03b5n \u2212 10\nn \u2264 n renewal points. All together, we find that if\nStickBreaki,j (\u03b3) \u22b3 \u03c6 holds for some \u03c6 \u2208 \u03a9+ , then rn (\u03c6) \u2265 |StickBreaki,j (\u03b3)| + 2\nand thus width(\u03c6[0,rn(\u03c6)] ) > \u03b5n.

This prediction arises\nfrom the law having infinite mean, and the scale invariance of the conjectural\nscaling limit. We refer to [1] for a discussion on the distribution of the scaled\nrenewal points in dimension two.\n5. Deriving Corollaries 1.2 and 1.3\nNote first that Corollary 1.2 is a trivial consequence of Theorem 1.1.\nSketch of proof of Corollary 1.3. We explain how to reduce the proof to a\nstandard application of the Ornstein-Zernike theory developed for subcritical\nself-avoiding walk by [15]. Fix K > 0. Instead of working on O\u03b4 with \u03b4 \u0581 0,\nwe expand the domain O by a factor of n and work on Zd . Without loss of\ngenerality, assume that ||a \u2212 b|| = 1. We write ac\nn and c\nbn for sites of nO \u2229 Zd\nclosest to na and nb. By Proposition 2.1,\n\u221a\n\u0001\nP\nC k\ne\nPSABn ||\u03b3k || \u2265 k/K\nk\u2264Kn\n(5.1)\nP(nO,c\n(|\u03b3| \u2264 Kn) \u2264\n.\nP\nc \u22121\nan,bn,\u03bc\n\u2212|\u03b3|\nc )\n\u03bc\nc\nc\n\u03b3\u2286nO: \u03b30 =c\nan , \u03b3|\u03b3| =bn\n\n\f26\n\nH. DUMINIL-COPIN AND A. HAMMOND\n\nTheorem 1.1 implies that the numerator of (5.1) decays exponentially fast.\nTherefore, it suffices to prove that the denominator does not decay exponentially fast. Fixing \u03b4 > 0, we wish to show that\nX\n\b\n(5.2)\n\u03bc\u2212|\u03b3|\n\u2265 exp \u2212 \u03b4n\nc\nc\n\u03b3\u2286nO: \u03b30 =c\nan , \u03b3|\u03b3| =bn\n\nfor n large enough. In the spirit of the proof of Theorem A of [15], it may be\nargued that, for z < \u03bc\u22121\nc ,\nn\no\nX\n|\u03b3|\nz \u2265 exp \u2212 lengthz (\u03a9, a, b)n(1 + on\u2192\u221e (1)) ,\nc\n\u03b3\u2286nO: \u03b30 =c\nan , \u03b3|\u03b3| =bn\n\nwhere lengthz (\u03a9, a, b) is the length of the geodesic from a to b in \u03a9 for the\nnorm associated to the correlation length of self-avoiding walk of parameter z\n(see (1.3) of [15] for the definition of this correlation length). ThatPthis corre|\u03b3|\nlation length diverges as z \u0580 \u03bc\u22121\nc follows from the divergence of\n\u03b3\u2208SAW z\nin this limit (a fact which we noted in the proof of Lemma 2.2). Thus, the\nthat lengthz (\u03a9, a, b) < \u03b4.\nparameter z can be chosen close enough to \u03bc\u22121\nc\nWe thus obtain (5.2).\n\u0003\nReferences\n[1] Tom Alberts and Hugo Duminil-Copin.
