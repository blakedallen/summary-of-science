The area covered by the catalog is 494 deg2 ; the majority\nof the objects were found in SDSS commissioning data using a multicolor selection\ntechnique. The quasar redshifts range from 0.15 to 5.03. For each object the catalog\npresents positions accurate to better than 0.2\u2032\u2032 rms per coordinate, five band (ugriz)\nCCD-based photometry with typical accuracy of 0.05 mag, radio and X-ray emission\nproperties, and information on the morphology and selection method. Calibrated\nspectra of all objects in the catalog, covering the wavelength region 3800 to 9200 \u00c5 at\na spectral resolution of 1800-2100, are also available. Since the quasars were selected\nduring the commissioning period, a time when the quasar selection algorithm was\nundergoing frequent revisions, the sample is not homogeneous and is not intended for\nstatistical analysis.\n\nSubject headings: catalogs, surveys, quasars:general\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nSince the first measurement of a quasar redshift nearly 40 years ago (Schmidt 1963), the\nnumber of known quasars has steadily risen; the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED)\nand the quasar catalog of V\u00e9ron & Veron (2001) each contain on the order of 25,000 quasars.\nA large fraction of these objects were recently discovered by the 2dF Quasar Survey (Croom et\nal. 2001), which is extremely effective at identifying quasars with redshifts below 3.0 that have bJ\nmagnitudes between 18.25 and 20.85.\nThis paper presents the first edition of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Quasar Catalog.\nThe goal of the SDSS quasar survey is to obtain spectra of \u2248 100,000 quasars from 10,000 deg2 of\nthe North Galactic Cap. For quasars with (u \u2212 g) < +1.5 (which corresponds to a redshift of near\nthree), the survey will reach a flux limit of i \u2248 19; quasars with (u \u2212 g) > +1.5 (corresponding to\na redshift range in the SDSS of between 3.0 and \u2248 5.5-6.0), the sensitivity limit will be i \u2248 20.\nThe survey will provide CCD-based photometry in five broad bands covering the entire optical\nwindow, morphological information, and spectra from 3800 \u00c5 to 9200 \u00c5 at a spectral resolution\nof 1800-2100. A review of the SDSS is given by York et al. (2000); Richards et al. (2002) present\nthe details of the quasar target algorithm.\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nThe catalog in the present paper consists of the 3814 objects in the SDSS Early Data Release\n(EDR; Stoughton et al. 2002) with reliable redshifts whose spectra have at least one emission line\nwith a FWHM broader than 1000 km s\u22121 and which have a luminosity larger than Mi\u2217 = \u221223\n(calculated assuming an H0 = 50 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 , \u03a9M = 1.0, \u03a9\u039b = 0 cosmology, which will be\nused throughout this paper). The quasars range in redshift from 0.15 to 5.03, and 3000 (79%)\nwere discovered by the SDSS (an object is classified as previously known if NED contains a quasar\nwithin 5\u2032\u2032 of the SDSS position).\nA few quasar-related studies based on subsets of the SDSS Early Release Data have been\nrecently published. The most comprehensive investigations, both using samples containing more\nthan 2000 quasars, are the quasar color-redshift relation for redshifts between zero and five\n(Richards et al. 2001a) and the construction of a very high signal-to-noise ratio composite quasar\nspectrum (Vanden Berk et al. 2001). The SDSS has proven to be extremely effective at identifying\nhigh-redshift quasars; to date the SDSS has discovered more than 140 at redshifts above four, and\nten of the eleven known quasars at z \u2265 5 (see Zheng et al. 2000, Anderson et al. 2001, Fan et\nal. 2001, and references therein; the sole non-SDSS z > 5 quasar is described in Sharp et al. 2001).\nThe observations used to produce the catalog are presented in Section 2. The construction of\nthe catalog and the catalog format are discussed in Sections 3 and 4, respectively, and Section 5\ncontains a summary of the catalog. A brief discussion of plans for future editions of the catalog is\ngiven in Section 6. The catalog material can be found at a public web site 28 .\n\n2.\n2.1.\n\nObservations\n\nSloan Digital Sky Survey\n\nThe Sloan Digital Sky Survey uses a CCD camera (Gunn et al. 1998) on a dedicated 2.5-m\ntelescope at Apache Point Observatory, New Mexico, to obtain images in five broad optical bands\nover 10,000 deg2 of the high Galactic latitude sky centered approximately on the North Galactic\nPole. The five filters (designated u, g, r, i, and z) cover the entire wavelength range of the CCD\nresponse (Fukugita et al. 1996); the filter response curves are given in Stoughton et al. (2002).\nSince the SDSS photometric system is not yet finalized, we refer to the SDSS photometry presented\nhere as u\u2217 , g\u2217 , r \u2217 , i\u2217 , and z \u2217 . The photometric calibration is reproducible to 0.05, 0.03, 0.03, 0.03,\nand 0.05 magnitudes in u\u2217 , g\u2217 , r \u2217 , i\u2217 , and z \u2217 , respectively; the absolute calibration in Janskys is\nuncertain at the 10% level. All magnitudes in the quasar catalog refer to the point spread function\nmeasurements of the photometric pipeline (see Stoughton et al. 2002 for details).\nPhotometric calibration is provided by simultaneous observations with a 20-inch telescope\nat the same site (see Hogg et al. 2001 and Stoughton et al. 2002). The survey data processing\n28\n\nhttp://archive.stsci.edu/sdss/documents/prepared ds.html\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nsoftware measures the properties of each detected object in the imaging data in all five bands, and\ndetermines and applies both astrometric and photometric calibrations (Pier et al., unpublished;\nLupton et al. 2001). The image quality in the EDR, which consists of observations taken during\nthe SDSS commissioning period, is considerably poorer than that expected for the survey proper;\nthe 95% completeness limits for stars in the EDR are typically 22.0, 22.2, 22.2, 21.3, and 20.5\nin u\u2217 , g \u2217 , r \u2217 , i\u2217 and z \u2217 , respectively. The image of an unresolved source brighter than r \u2217 \u2248 14 will\nbe saturated.\nThe imaging data in the SDSS EDR consists of eight imaging scans (SDSS scan numbers 94,\n125, 752, 756, 1336, 1339, 1356, and 1359), acquired between September 1998 and April 2000, that\ncover approximately 500 deg2 . The first four scans are along the celestial equator in the Northern\nand Southern high-latitude Galactic sky; the final four contain 68 deg2 in the SIRTF First Look\nSurvey region (see Stoughton et al. 2002).\n\n2.2.\n\nTarget Selection\n\nThe SDSS filter system was designed to allow quasars at redshifts between zero and six\nto be identified with multicolor selection techniques. The effective wavelength of the u filter is\nshortward of the Balmer discontinuity; therefore the color difference between low-redshift quasars\nand early-type stars is larger in (u \u2212 g) than the standard color of (U \u2212 B). The inclusion of\nthe near-infrared filter (z) extends the maximum redshift for SDSS quasars out to \u2248 6 (Fan\net al. 2001). The vast majority of quasars follow a tight color-redshift relation in SDSS filters\n(Richards et al. 2001a); this feature allows development of techniques that may produce reliable\nphotometric redshifts for quasars (Richards et al. 2001b, Budavari et al. 2001). In addition to the\nmulticolor selection, unresolved objects brighter than i \u2248 19 that are coincident with FIRST radio\nsources (Becker, White, & Helfand 1995) are also identified as quasar candidates.\nNote that the point spread function magnitudes are used for the quasar target selection. For\ncandidates whose likely redshifts are less than three, both extended and point sources are included\nas quasar candidates; however, extended sources are excluded if they lie in a region of color space\nthat is densely occupied by normal galaxies (see Richards et al. 2002). At larger redshifts, an\nobject must be unresolved in the SDSS images to become a spectroscopic target.\nTarget selection also imposes a maximum brightness limit on the objects. Accurate\nphotometry of point sources brighter than r \u2248 14 is impossible as their images are saturated;\nobjects that have saturated pixels are dropped from further consideration. An additional constraint\nis introduced to prevent saturation and fiber cross-talk problems in the SDSS spectroscopic\nobservations; an object cannot be included in the quasar spectroscopic program if it has an i\nmagnitude brighter than 15.0. Objects may also dropped from consideration if the photometric\nmeasurements are considered suspect, for example objects close to very bright stars, data affected\nby cosmic rays, etc.\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nOne of the most important tasks during the SDSS commissioning period was to refine the\nquasar target selection algorithm. This selection algorithm was varied throughout the time that\nthe EDR observations were obtained, so the objects in this catalog were not found via a uniform\nset of selection criteria. Indeed, some of the quasars in the catalog were not spectroscopically\ntargeted just by the SDSS quasar selection algorithm, but rather by one of the other modules\n(Stoughton et al. 2002): galaxies, stars (mostly aimed at objects with the colors of unusual types of\nstars), optical counterparts of ROSAT sources, or serendipitous targets (again, objects of extreme\ncolors, but defined independently from the quasar selection color limits). For a detailed discussion\nof the process of spectroscopic target selection, see Stoughton et al. (2002); Richards et al. (2002)\ndiscuss the final SDSS target selection criteria for quasars.\nThe evaluations of the survey selection efficiency (number of quasars compared to the number\nof quasar candidates) and completeness (fraction of quasars found by the SDSS) are complex\ntasks, particularly when dealing with the EDR data base; these issues, as concern future data\nreleases, will be addressed by Richards et al. (2002). The current estimate on the efficiency of the\nfinal selection algorithm is 65-70%; the algorithm's completeness, determined from simulations\nand comparison with previously known quasars, should be approximately 90%. Both of these\nvalues have brightness and redshift dependences.\n\n2.3.\n\nSpectroscopy\n\nSpectroscopic targets chosen by the various SDSS selection algorithms (e.g., quasars, galaxies,\nstars, serendipity) are organized onto a series of 3\u25e6 diameter circular fields (Blanton et al. 2001).\nThe positions are mapped and drilled into aluminum plates; each plate contains 640 fibers that\nfeed two double spectrographs mounted at the Cassegrain focus of the SDSS 2.5-m telescope (see\nYork et al. 2000 and Castander et al. 2001 for details). The spectrographs produce data covering\n3800\u20139200 \u00c5, with the beam split at 6150 \u00c5 by a dichroic. The data have a spectral resolution\nranging from 1800 to 2100. A total of 320 fibers enter each spectrograph; each fiber subtends a\ndiameter of 3\u2032\u2032 on the sky, and because of mechanical constraints the centers of the fibers must be\nseparated by at least 55\u2032\u2032 (although in regions of sky in which plates overlap, one can have spectra\nof objects separated by less than this angle). Typically about 75 quasar candidate spectra among\nthe 640 fibers are observed in a 45-minute observation (broken into three 15-minute exposures) of\na field; the exposure time is increased in conditions of poor seeing or reduced sky transparency\nto meet survey's minimum signal-to-noise ratio requirement of (S/N)2 of 15 per spectrograph\npixel at g\u2217 = 20.2 and i\u2217 = 19.9. (See Stoughton et al. 2002 for an extensive discussion of the\nspectroscopic observations.)\nObservations from 92 spectroscopic fields are used to form the catalog. The EDR contains 95\nspectroscopic plates; of the three \"missing\" plates, one was a special observation of a star cluster,\nand the other two were duplicates of other EDR plates but drilled for observations at different\nairmasses. The celestial locations of the 92 plates are are displayed in Figure 1. The total area\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\ncovered by the spectroscopic observations is 494 deg2 (as can be seen from the figure, there is\nsignificant overlap between many of the fields). The locations of the plate centers are given\nin Table 1, along with the number of quasars in the catalog contained on each plate. Note the\nwide range (10 to 123) in the number of quasars per spectroscopic plate in these commissioning\nobservations; this variation is due to the various tests carried out during the commissioning\nexercise.\nThe data, along with the associated calibration frames, are processed by the SDSS\nSpectroscopic Pipeline (Burles et al., unpublished), which removes instrumental effects, extracts\nthe spectra, determines the wavelength calibration, subtracts the sky spectrum, removes the\natmospheric absorption bands, and performs the flux calibration.\nThe calibrated spectra are classified into various groups (e.g., star, galaxy, quasar) by another\nautomated software pipeline (Frieman et al., unpublished). The quasar classification is based\nsolely on the presence of broad emission lines in the spectra; the classification software does not\nemploy information about the selection of the object (e.g., was the spectrum obtained because the\ntarget selection process identified the object as a quasar candidate?), nor is luminosity used by the\nSDSS pipeline as a criterion for designating an object as a quasar. See Stoughton et al. (2002) for\ndetails regarding the spectral classification criteria.\nThe redshifts are measured by a combination of cross-correlation (using Fourier techniques)\nto a quasar template, and searches for emission-lines, together with code that recognizes the\nonset of the Lyman \u03b1 forest. The software returns a redshift quality flag; when this flag indicates\nthat a reliable redshift cannot be assigned, the redshift is measured manually. In practice, all of\nthe quasar spectra presented herein (and the sample from which they were drawn) were visually\ninspected multiple times.\nFigure 2 shows the calibrated SDSS spectra of six of the catalog quasars representing a wide\nrange of properties; all were previously unknown. We discuss these individual objects in Section 5.\nThese spectra have been slightly smoothed for display purposes.\n\n3.\n\nConstruction of the SDSS Quasar Catalog\n\nThe quasar catalog was constructed in three stages. The first step, which produced over 99%\nof the entries in the catalog, was simply to find the objects (4487 in total) in the EDR that\nthe spectroscopic pipeline classified as quasars. These objects were selected using a simple\nSQL query to the EDR database using the SDSS Query Tool29 (Stoughton et al. 2002). We\nrequested all objects with spectral classifications of SPEC QSO (specClass=3) or SPEC HIZ QSO\n(specClass=4) from the sxPrimary class of objects. For example, in SQL notation:\n29\n\nhttp://archive.stsci.edu/sdss/software/\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nSELECT objID\nFROM sxPrimary\nWHERE specobj.specClass == 3 || specobj.specClass == 4\nThis query does not necessarily return all quasars in the EDR database, but rather it identifies\nall spectra that meet some well-defined criteria that cause them to belong to the sxPrimary class\nof objects and to be classified as quasars.\nThis data base was supplemented by two additional efforts. A total of 16 quasars, missed by\nthe SDSS pipeline but identified during a visual inspection of all the EDR spectra during a search\nfor extreme BAL quasars, were added to the quasar list. Besides BAL quasars, these objects include\ntwo star-quasar superpositions (SDSS J012412.47\u2212010049.8 and SDSS J014349.14+002128.4) and\nthe enigmatic object SDSS J010540.75\u2212003314.0; see Hall et al. (2002) for a discussion of this\nsample.\nAt a late stage of the production of the catalog, a visual search of all \u2248 17,000 EDR spectra\nthat were not classified as either quasars or galaxies was completed; the spectra of 61 of these\nsources indicated a possible AGN nature, and they were added to the initial quasar data base.\nFor the catalog we selected the subset of objects that 1) have at least one emission line\nwith a FWHM that exceeds 1000 km s\u22121 and 2) have luminosities that exceed Mi\u2217 = \u221223. The\nFWHMs of the lines were determined by performing Gaussian fits to the line profiles. Note that\nany \"narrow-lined\" (Type II) quasars whose lines have FWHMs less than 1000 km s\u22121 will not be\nincluded in the catalog.\nThe absolute magnitudes were calculated by correcting the i\u2217 measurement for Galactic\nextinction (using the maps of Schlegel, Finkbeiner, & Davis 1998) and assuming that the quasar\nspectral energy distribution in the ultraviolet-optical can be represented by a power law (f\u03bd \u221d \u03bd \u03b1 ),\nwhere \u03b1 = \u22120.5 (Vanden Berk et al. 2001). The i band was selected for the luminosity indicator\nrather than the more standard definition that uses the B filter primarily because of the ability\nof the SDSS to detect high-redshift quasars. Luminosity estimates of objects at redshifts where\nthe Lyman \u03b1 emission line is shifted redward of the observed filter are unreliable because of the\nabsorption produced by the Lyman \u03b1 forest and Lyman-limit systems; the Lyman \u03b1 line does not\nreach the center of the i filter until redshifts of \u2248 5. Other advantages of the i band are 1) the flux\nlimit of the SDSS quasar survey is set by the i band flux and 2) Galactic (and internal) reddening\nwill be less in i than in B measurements. This definition actually matches the canonical definition\nof MB = \u221223 quite well; for typical quasars, the rest frame (B \u2212 i) \u2248 +0.35. The only significant\ndrawback to basing quasar luminosities on i rather than B is that at redshifts of a few tenths or\nless the luminosity calculation could be heavily influenced by the presence of a luminous stellar\ncomponent rather than the quasar continuum (although note that we use point spread function\nmagnitudes in this calculation, not Petrosian magnitudes, even for extended sources).\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\nThese criteria reduced the sample from 4564 to 3847 objects. Of the 717 objects that were\ndropped from the catalog, only ten were rejected solely because of the line width requirement.\nOf these ten objects, seven came from the second supplemental sample, which was produced\nby a visual inspection of the spectra and objects were included if the emission line appeared to\nbe resolved; the other three objects, all from the original EDR quasar query, had poor quality\nspectra that were erroneously assigned redshifts larger than six. As expected, the vast majority\nof the rejected objects were low-luminosity active galactic nuclei; the SDSS images of 82% of the\nrejections were morphologically classified as extended sources.\nThe SDSS spectrum of each of the 3847 quasars was manually inspected by several of the\nauthors. The SDSS pipeline redshifts were undoubtedly correct for over 97% of the objects;\nfor most of the remaining spectra the redshift status flag indicated that the redshift was either\nuncertain or, in some cases, unknown. These spectra tended to be either of very low signal-to-noise\nratio, strong (often spectacular) broad absorption line (BAL) quasars, or spectra containing only\none, relatively weak, emission line.\nUpon review of the spectra, a consensus was reached that it was impossible to reliably\ndetermine the redshifts of 32 objects; these were dropped from the sample (but of course are\navailable as part of the EDR). The spectroscopic pipeline redshifts of 33 objects were significantly\nin error (again, most were flagged as uncertain measurements); the revised redshifts are included\nin this catalog. The revised redshift for one of the objects caused it to fall below the quasar\nluminosity cutoff. We have also revised the redshifts of many of the high-redshift (z > 4) quasars\n(usually by \u2248 0.02), as automated redshift measurements of these objects is difficult because the\nemission lines unaffected by the Lyman \u03b1 forest either become inaccessible in the SDSS spectra or\nare located in regions of the spectrum with low signal-to-noise ratio; we have included the values\ndetermined in previous publications (see Anderson et al. 2001 and references therein).\nAs a final note, we searched for BL Lacs in the EDR by matching the FIRST catalog with the\nentire EDR spectroscopic data base, but after visual examination of the spectra of the candidates\nwe did not identify any unambiguous examples of BL Lacs that are not already in the catalog.\n\n4.\n\nCatalog Format\n\nThe first edition of the SDSS Quasar Catalog consists of 3814 quasars. The catalog is written\nin ASCII format and is 685 kB in size. The first 37 lines consist of catalog documentation; this is\nfollowed by 3814 lines containing information on the quasars. There are 32 columns in each line; a\nsummary of the information is given in Table 2 (most of the catalog documentation is a repeat of\nTable 2).\nNotes on the catalog columns:\n1) The official names of the objects are given by the format SDSS Jhhmmss.ss+ddmmss.s; only\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nthe final 18, nondegenerate characters are given in the catalog.\n2-3) These columns contain the J2000 coordinates (Right Ascension and Declination) in radians.\nThe positions for the vast majority of the objects are accurate to 0.1\u2032\u2032 rms in each coordinate; the\nlargest expected errors are 0.2\u2032\u2032 .\n4) The SDSS quasar redshifts are not determined by simply using the the rest laboratory\nwavelengths of their emission lines, but according to the empirical rest wavelengths of their\nemission lines based upon the composite spectrum of Vanden Berk et al. (2001) assuming that\n[O III] represents the systemic (center of mass) redshift of the quasars. The redshifts are so\ndetermined because it is now well-known that the empirical centers of many quasar emission lines\n(the high ionization lines in particular) are shifted with respect to the systemic redshift of the\nquasars (Tytler & Fan 1992, Vanden Berk et al. 2001, and references therein). The method used\nby the SDSS will produce redshifts that are much closer to the systemic redshift in the ensemble\naverage; see Stoughton et al. (2002) for more details regarding how the redshift determination is\nimplemented. The statistical errors of the redshifts, based on either the height and width of the\ncross correlation function (c.f., Tonry & Davis 1979) or on the scatter of the redshifts measured\nfrom the individual emission lines, are less than 0.01 for the non-BALs and 0.01-0.03 for BAL\nquasars.\n5) The data base search technique used to find the quasar is coded in this column. If the spectrum\nof the object was classified as a quasar by the SDSS software, this column contains a \"0\"; a \"1\"\nindicates the 16 objects identified in the extreme BAL search, a \"2\" is given for the 10 quasars\nfound in the extensive visual search of EDR spectra that were not classified as either quasars or\ngalaxies by the SDSS software.\n6-15) These columns contain the magnitudes and errors for each object in the five SDSS filters.\nThe values refer to magnitudes measured by fitting to the point spread function to the data\n(see Stoughton et al. 2002). Note that the quantities are asinh magnitudes (Lupton, Gunn, &\nSzalay 1999), which are defined by\n2.5\nm = \u2212\nln 10\n\n\u0014\n\nf /f0\nasinh\n2b\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n+ ln b\n\n\u0015\n\nwhere f0 is the flux from a zero magnitude object and the quantity b is the softening parameter.\nThe SDSS has set b, which is dimensionless, such that zero flux corresponds to magnitudes 24.63,\n25.11, 24.80, 24.36, and 22.83 in the u, g, r, i, and z bands, respectively (Stoughton et al. 2002).\nFor measurements that are approximately 2.5 magnitudes brighter than the zero flux values, the\ndifference between asinh magnitudes and standard magnitudes (Pogson 1856) are less than 1%;\nfor the vast majority of the entries in the catalog the differences between asinh and standard\nmagnitudes are negligible (the primary exceptions being the u magnitudes of high-redshift\nquasars). The SDSS photometric system is normalized so that the ugriz magnitudes are on the\nAB system (Oke & Gunn 1983).\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\n16) Galactic absorption in the u band based on the maps of Schlegel, Finkbeiner, & Davis (1998).\nFor an RV = 3.1 absorbing medium, the absorptions in the SDSS bands are\nAu = 5.155 E(B \u2212 V )\nAg = 3.793 E(B \u2212 V )\nAr = 2.751 E(B \u2212 V )\nAi = 2.086 E(B \u2212 V )\nAz = 1.479 E(B \u2212 V )\n17) If there is a source in the FIRST catalog within 2.0\u2032\u2032 of the quasar position, this column\ncontains the FIRST peak flux density (mJy) at 20 cm.\n18) The logarithm of the vignetting corrected count rate (photons s\u22121 ) in the broad energy band in\nthe following ROSAT catalogs: All-Sky Survey Faint Source Catalog (Voges et al. 2000); All-Sky\nSurvey Bright Source Catalog (Voges et al. 1999); and the PSPC Pointing and HRI Pointing\nCatalogs (private communication from the ROSAT Result Archive collaboration). The matching\nradius was set to 60.0\u2032\u2032 (Faint Source Catalog), 30\u2032\u2032 (Bright Source Catalog and PSPC Pointings)\nand 10\u2032\u2032 (HRI Pointings); an entry of \"0\" in this column indicates no X-ray detection.\n19) The absolute magnitude in the i band calculated assuming H0 = 50, \u03a9M = 1, and \u03a9\u039b = 0, a\npower law (frequency) index of \u22120.5, and correcting the i\u2217 measurement for Galactic extinction.\n20) If the SDSS photometric pipeline classified the image of the quasar as a point source, the\ncatalog entry is 0; if the quasar is extended, the catalog entry is 1.\n21) The version of the quasar target selection algorithm used to select the object is coded in this\ncolumn (1 = v2.2a, 2 = v2.5, 3 = v2.7); see Stoughton et al. (2002) for details of the different\ntechniques.\n22-27) These six columns indicate the spectroscopic target selection status for each object. An\nentry of \"1\" indicates that the object satisfied the given criterion (see Stoughton et al. 2002 for\ndetails). Note that an object can be targeted by more than one selection algorithm.\n29-31) Information about the spectroscopic observation (modified Julian date, spectroscopic plate\nnumber, and spectroscopic fiber number) used to determine the redshift are contained in these\ncolumns.\n32) If there is a source in the NED quasar data base within 5.0\u2032\u2032 of the quasar position, the NED\nobject name is given in this column, unless the NED name refers to an SDSS-discovered object.\nIn addition to the catalog, the SDSS spectra of all objects in the catalog are available at a\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\npublic internet site30 .\n\n5.\n\nCatalog Summary\n\nOf the 3814 objects in the catalog, 3000 were discovered by the SDSS. The 3814 quasars\nspan a wide range of properties: redshifts from 0.15 to 5.03, 15.16 < i\u2217 < 20.82 (only four objects\nhave i\u2217 > 20.5), and \u221230.1 < Mi\u2217 < \u221223.0. The catalog contains 329 matches with ROSAT\ncatalogs and 326 FIRST sources, as well as a number of unusual BAL quasars.\nFigure 3 displays the i\u2217 -redshift relation for the quasars. Previously known objects are\nindicated with open circles. The curved cutoff on the left hand side of the graph is due to the\nminimum luminosity criterion (Mi\u2217 < \u221223). The ridge of points just fainter than i\u2217 = 19 at\nredshifts below three is the flux limit of the low redshift sample; low-redshift points fainter than\ni\u2217 = 19 primarily represent objects selected via criteria other than the primary multicolor sample\n(e.g., serendipity). Above a redshift of \u2248 3, nearly all the quasars in the catalog were discovered\nby the SDSS.\nA histogram of the catalog redshifts is shown in Figure 4. The clear majority of the quasars\nhave redshifts below two (the median redshift is 1.46), but there is a significant tail of objects out\nto a redshift of five. The dip in the curve at redshifts between 3.3 and 3.5 is due to difficulties\nencountered selecting these objects during the commissioning period; the final version of the target\nselection algorithm will significantly reduce the number of missed quasars in this redshift region.\n\n5.1.\n\nAnalysis of Quasar Selection\n\nA summary of the spectroscopic selection is given in Table 3. There are six selection classes,\nwhich are columns 22 to 27 in the catalog. The second column in Table 3 gives the numbers\nof each object that satisfied a given selection criteria, the third column contains the number of\nobjects that were identified only by that selection class. As expected, the solid majority (81%)\nwere selected based on the SDSS quasar selection criteria; one-third of the catalog objects were\nselected on that basis only. Over 60% of the quasars were identified by the serendipity code, which\nis also primarily an \"unusual color\" algorithm. About one-seventh of the catalog was selected by\nthe serendipity criteria alone; these objects tend to be low-redshift quasars that fall below the\nmagnitude limit of the quasar survey algorithm.\nOf the 2528 quasars with i\u2217 < 19.0, 2477 were found from the quasar multicolor selection; if\none includes multicolor and FIRST selection, then only 20 i\u2217 < 19.0 catalog quasars are missed.\nFor the entire catalog, over 99% of the quasars are selected by either multicolor, FIRST, or\n30\n\nhttp://archive.stsci.edu/sdss/documents/prepared ds.html\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\nserendipity criteria. It should be noted that the rather high fraction of faint z < 3 quasars selected\nby serendipity is not likely to be representative of future quasar target selection, as the number of\nquasar serendipity targets in the catalog is a result of circumstances specific to the commissioning\nperiod. We expect that the final SDSS selection algorithms, designed to produce complete samples\nof galaxies and quasars, will have a smaller fraction of fibers assigned to serendipitous targets than\nwas the situation during the commissioning period.\nOne of the catalog entries, SDSS J114324.97\u2212003614.5, was selected by the ROSAT algorithm\nbut is not listed as a ROSAT source. This situation arose because during the SDSS commissioning\nperiod, the ROSAT catalogs were being upgraded; this source was included in early versions of the\nROSAT catalogs but did not meet the final ROSAT selection criteria.\n\n5.2.\n\nBright Quasars\n\nFourteen of the catalog quasars have i\u2217 < 16.5, but only one, SDSS J014942.50+001501.7, a\n= 16.24 quasar at a redshift of 0.55, was not previously known (see spectrum in Figure 2). The\ncatalog contains 51 quasars brighter than i\u2217 = 17.0; 16 are SDSS discoveries. Four of the sixteen\nSDSS discoveries are FIRST sources, and seven have been detected with ROSAT.\n\ni\u2217\n\n5.3.\n\nLuminous Quasars\n\nOf the nine catalog quasars with Mi\u2217 < \u221228.8 (3C 273 has Mi = \u221227.3 in our\nadopted cosmology), three were not previously known. SDSS J173352.23+540030.5, at\nz = 3.43 and Mi\u2217 = \u221229.4, is the second most luminous quasar (after HS 1700+6416 =\nSDSS J170100.62+641209.0) in the catalog; its spectrum is displayed in Figure 2. This object is\na 7.72 mJy FIRST source. The other new highly luminous quasars are SDSS J012412.47\u2212010049.8\n(z = 2.82, Mi\u2217 = \u221229.4), and SDSS J152119.68\u2212004818.8 (z = 2.93, Mi\u2217 = \u221228.9).\n\n5.4.\n\nBroad Absorption Line Quasars\n\nThe catalog contains a number of BAL quasars, and it is clear that the SDSS is quite effective\nat finding extreme examples of this class (see Hall et al. 2002 for a discussion). One of the more\nspectacular examples is SDSS J172341.09+555340.5, a z = 2.113 low-ionization BAL quasar whose\ntroughs have a \"scalloped\" appearance (see Figure 2).\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\n5.5.\n\nLow-Redshift Quasars\n\nThe quasar with the lowest redshift in the catalog, SDSS J232259.99\u2212005359.3 at z = 0.15,\nwas not previously known (spectrum is shown in Figure 2). Of course, there are many lowerredshift AGN in the EDR that do not satisfy our luminosity criterion. Of the 49 quasars with\nredshifts below 0.30, 33 are reported here for the first time, as well as eight new z < 0.20 quasars.\nIncluded in the new discoveries are five FIRST sources and fifteen ROSAT detections. One of the\nlow-redshift objects, SDSS J011254.91+000313.0 at z = 0.24, is PB 06317 in the NED data base\nwith the erroneous redshift of z = 1.23.\n\n5.6.\n\nHigh-Redshift Quasars\n\nTwo of the fifty z > 3.95 quasars in the catalog have not been previously published:\nSDSS J103432.71\u2212002702.5, at z = 4.38, and SDSS J122657.97+000938.4, at z = 4.14. The\nspectra of both objects are displayed in Figure 2. Observations of most of the z > 4 quasars in the\ncatalog were described by Anderson et al. (2001). Although only a small fraction of the objects in\nthe catalog are at high-redshift, the SDSS is clearly very effective at discovering such quasars; 96\nof the 101 catalog entries with z > 3.5 are SDSS discoveries.\n\n5.7.\n\nClose Pairs\n\nThere are 14 pairs of quasars in the catalog with angular separation less than 70\u2032\u2032 . One pair,\nSDSS J025959.69+004813.5 and SDSS J030000.56+004828.0, both new discoveries, have redshifts\n(z = 0.893) identical within the errors, and a separation of only 19.5\u2032\u2032 , corresponding to a physical\ndistance of 164 kpc; this is almost certainly a binary quasar.\n\n5.8.\n\nRedshift Disagreements with Previous Measurements\n\nThe redshifts of twenty quasars in this catalog disagree by more than 0.07 from the values\ngiven in the NED database; the information for each of these objects is given in Table 4. All of the\nredshift discrepancies are larger than 0.4, and in ten of the cases the SDSS redshift is smaller than\nthe NED. Three of the quasars in Table 4 have blank fields in the NED redshift column (identified\nby \"...\" in the third column of Table 4), and seven of the Table 4 objects are from the UM survey.\nThe incorrect published redshifts of UM 203 and UM 183 were noted by Richards et al. (2001a).\nWe have reexamined the spectra of the 17 objects with actual redshift disagreements, and for\nall but a few the SDSS value is undoubtedly the correct one; in the cases that are not certain,\nwe believe the SDSS redshifts are the more likely ones. Examples where the SDSS redshift\ncould be incorrect include the two BAL quasars LBQS 0021\u22120100 and [HB89]2345+002, and the\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\n2dF survey object 2QZ J130916.6\u2212001550, where Croom et al. (2001) identify the emission line\nat 6900 \u00c5 as Mg II, whereas we interpret this line as H\u03b2 and the feature near 4000 \u00c5 as Mg II\nemission. Note that quality flag for 2QZ J130916.6\u2212001550 given by Croon et al. (2001) indicates\nan uncertain redshift.\n\n5.9.\n\nMorphology\n\nThe SDSS photometric pipeline classifies the images of 122 quasars as resolved. As one would\nexpect, the vast majority (87%) of the extended objects have redshifts below one, but there are a\nnumber of resolved quasars at higher redshifts (the highest redshift of an extended object is 3.61).\nThe majority of the large redshift \"resolved\" quasars are probably measurement errors, but\nthis sample probably contains a few chance superpositions of quasars and foreground objects or\npossibly some small angle separation gravitational lenses. A detailed study of one of the extended\nz > 1 quasars in the catalog, SDSS J122608.02\u2212000602.2 at a redshift of 1.12, shows that the\nsource consists of a close pair of quasars and is likely to be a gravitational lens system (Inada et\nal. 2002).\n\n6.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe current catalog contains slightly less than 5% of the planned survey area, although again\nwe point out that the observations in the EDR were taken during the commissioning period\nand the final algorithm will provide more systematic study of the survey region. We plan to\nproduce regular updates to the quasar catalog, on approximately one year intervals, throughout\nthe duration of the survey. The next release is scheduled for late 2002; we expect it to contain\nmore than 20,000 quasars, most identified with the final SDSS quasar selection algorithm.\nWe would like to thank Niel Brandt for his assistance with preparing the X-ray information\nfor the catalog, and Megan Donahue for preparing the public web site.
