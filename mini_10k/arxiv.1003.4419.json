After\nextending this Hamiltonian to include interactions with a quantized electromagnetic field, we calculate the amplitude associated with the simplest, tree-level Feynman diagram: the vertex connecting\na photon with two electrons. This amplitude leads to analytic expressions for the 3D angular dependence of photon emission, the photon-mediated electron-hole recombination rate, and corrections to\ngraphene's opacity \u03c0\u03b1 and dynamic conductivity \u03c0e2 /2h for situations away from thermal equilibrium, as would occur in a graphene laser. We find that Ohmic dissipation in perfect graphene can\nbe attributed to spontaneous emission.\nPACS numbers: 78.67.Wj, 78.67.Ch, 13.40.Hq\n\nElectron-photon interactions determine the optoelectronic properties of a material. The electrons in\ngraphene, a single atomic layer of graphite, exhibit superlative electronic properties associated with their exotic Hamiltonian [1, 2]. In particular, a tight binding\nmodel [3] of graphene produces a Hamiltonian that, for\nlow energy excitations, is formally identical to a 2+1 dimensional Dirac equation for massless fermions [4], with\nthe Fermi velocity and the sublattice state vector filling\nthe roles of the speed of light and spin respectively. As\npart of an effort to understand how electron-hole recombination might limit the function of a graphene-based\ntransistor, we use this Dirac Hamiltonian to calculate\nthe amplitude for the electron-photon interaction diagrammed in Fig. 1. Rotating this diagram with respect\nto the time axis allows the consideration of both photon emission (i.e. recombination) and absorption rates,\nwhich we relate to graphene's opacity and dynamic conductivity.\nThese measurable [5\u20138] properties have been previously treated using semiclassical methods (where the\nelectromagnetic field is not quantized) within the Kubo\nand Landauer formalisms [9\u201313] and perturbation theory [6, 14]. Our fully quantum mechanical calculation\nreproduces results found previously, such as \u03c0\u03b1 for the\noptical opacity [6, 8, 15] and \u03c0e2 /2h [10\u201315] for the zerotemperature conductivity. We extend these previous results to non-equilibrium situations (e.g. population inversion) and specify the full angular dependence of photon\nemission/absorption. Furthermore, we identify spontaneous emission as the mechanism of dissipation, present\neven in idealized graphene, that is usually left unspecified\n[12\u201315].\nThe carbon atoms in graphene form a two-dimensional\nhoneycomb network with two inequivalent atomic sites\nper unit cell. In the simplest tight-binding description of\ngraphene, an electronic energy E is associated with each\natomic site in the sheet, and an energy t parametrizes\n\nFIG. 1: Schematic drawing of a representative emission process (left), and the corresponding Feynman diagram (right).\nThe photon lives in 3D space, while the electrons are confined\nto the graphene sheet. The initial electron is described by its\nmomentum pi = ~ki and its pseudospin \u21d2, which for a conduction electron near K+ is directed along ki . Interacting\nwith the photon (wavevector k\u03b3 and polarization \u03b5) destroys\nthe conduction electron, creating a valence band electron with\nmomentum ~kf and pseudospin \u21d0.\n\nthe probability of an electron hopping from one site to\nits neighbor on the other sublattice. An operator A\u2020Rj\ncreates a 2Pz electron on the 'A' site in cell j, with a\ncorresponding destruction operator ARj .

On the left, the\nK+ points are indicated by thin arrows, and the reciprocal\nlattice primitive vectors bi by thick arrows. Shading indicates how translating some slices of the hexagon by reciprocal\nlattice vectors reconstructs an equivalent Brillouin zone, here\nshown in a bowtie configuration, that centers the inequivalent\nK\u00b1 points in two triangular regions. Near the K\u00b1 points the\ndispersion relation is linear in |k|, which gives the Dirac cones\nshown on the right. Absorption or emission of a photon transfers an electron from one cone to the other.\n\nThere are two spin states per Qj , and two mobile 2Pz\nelectrons per cell, so the first Brillouin zone (Fig. 2) is\nexactly filled in electrically neutral graphene at zero temperature. The energy origin is set at the energy of the\nhighest occuppied states, which are those at the Brillouin\nzone corners K\u03ba = \u03ba 2b23+b1 + mb1 + nb2 [16]. The label\n\u03ba = \u00b11 indexes the two inequivalent corners. For Q near\na K\u03ba point the single-particle Hamiltonian H is\nH = vF (\u03ba\u03c3x px + \u03c3y py ),\n\n(3)\n\nwhere the momentum p = ~k = ~(Q \u2212 K). With \u03c6\ndefined by the in-plane components p~ of p = p~ + pz \u1e91\naccording to p~ = p(cos \u03c6x\u0302 + sin \u03c6\u0177), the corresponding\neigenvalue equation is\n\u03bavF p\nH|\u03c7i = \u221a\n2\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2212i\u03ba\u03c6\n\n0 e\nei\u03ba\u03c6\n0\n\n\u0013\u0012\n\n\u2212i\u03ba\u03c6/2\n\ne\n\u03b2\u03baei\u03ba\u03c6/2\n\n\u0013\n\n= \u03b2vF p|\u03c7i,\n\n(4)\nwhere the band index \u03b2 = \u00b11 labels whether the energy is positive or negative (i.e. conduction or valence).\nThus the Hamiltonian (3) produces a linear dispersion\nrelation E = \u00b1vF p. The product \u03b2\u03ba/2 gives the helicity\neigenvalue for the state |\u03c7i, where the helicity operator\nis defined as \u0125 = H/(2\u03bavF p).\nHaving identified the eigenspinors |\u03c7(~\np, \u03b2, \u03ba)i of the\nsingle particle Hamiltonian H, we can re-write the total\n\u2020\nHamiltonian H in terms of operators that create (CQ\n)\n\n\u0012\n\n0\n\nei\u03ba\u03c6\n\n\u0013\ne\u2212i\u03ba\u03c6\n(|\u03c7c iCc,Q + |\u03c7v iCv,Q )\n0\n\n(5)\n\nwhere the sum is over Q near K\u03ba and c (v) refers to the\nconduction (valence) band.\nWe introduce the electromagnetic field with a Peierls\n(minimal coupling) substitution p \u2192 p \u2212 qA/c, treating\nthe new vector potential term [17] as a quantized perturbation H \u2032 in the full Hamiltonian H = H0 + H \u2032 ,\nr\nX\n2\u03c0~\n\u2020 \u2212ik*r+i\u03c9t\n(\u03b5\u0302j Ckj eik*r\u2212i\u03c9t +\u03b5\u0302\u2217j Ckj\ne\n)\nA(r, t) = c\n\u01ebr V \u03c9\nkj\n\n(6)\nHere j indexes the photon's polarization states, V is the\nnormalization volume, \u01ebr is the relative permittivity, and\n\u03c9 = c|k|. As is evident from the appearance of the speed\nof light c (and not the Fermi velocity vF ) in this substitution, the electron-photon coupling implied follows\nfrom the local gauge invariance of the standard model\nLagrangian, and is not related to the properties of the\nHamiltonian (3) under gauge transformations.\nThe electron-photon interaction rate can be calculated\nusing the standard arguments of Fermi's Golden Rule,\nsuitably modified to account for the system's mixed dimensionality. The rate \u0393i\u2192f to go from an eigenstate\n|\u03c6i i of the unperturbed electronic Hamiltonian H0 to a\ngiven final state |\u03c6f i is\nd\n|h\u03c6f (t)|\u03c8(t)i|2 , where\n(7)\ndt\nZ t\n1\nh\u03c6f (t\u2032 )|H\u2032 (t\u2032 )|\u03c6i (t\u2032 )idt\u2032 \u2261 M.

The first and second parts of 1 + n\u03b3\ncorrespond to spontaneous and stimulated emission respectively [18].\nTo evaluate the angular matrix element in\n(11), we define an orthonormal triple k\u0302\u03b3\n=\n(sin \u03b8\u03b3 cos \u03c6\u03b3 , sin \u03b8\u03b3 sin \u03c6\u03b3 , cos \u03b8\u03b3 ), \u03b5\u03021 = \u1e91 \u00d7 k\u0302\u03b3 /|\u1e91 \u00d7 k\u0302\u03b3 |,\nand \u03b5\u03022 = k\u0302\u03b3 \u00d7 \u03b5\u03021 /|k\u0302\u03b3 \u00d7 \u03b5\u03021 | that describes the photon and\nits possible polarizations.

The energy of the initial conduction electron is half that of the photon, and\nof the same magnitude but opposite sign of the final valence electron. The photon's momentum is negligible in\n\nFIG. 3: Polar plot of photon emission distributions in the xz\nplane. The dashed (dotted) curve corresponds to the emission from an initial electron moving along the x-axis (y-axis),\nwhile the solid black curve represents the average over all k~i\ndirections. The Lambertian function cos \u03b8 is shown in grey for\ncomparison. The inset shows the 3D pattern for one choice of\nk. An electron moving along y emits a x-polarized photon,\nand thus cannot emit in the x direction.\n\ncomparison to the electrons'; as a result \u03c6c \u2248 \u03c6v and\nK+ \u2194 K\u2212 transitions are impossible in this low energy\nlimit. To lowest order in vF /c the angular dependence of\n(13) is (1 \u2212 sin2 \u03b8\u03b3 sin2 (\u03c6\u03b3 \u2212 \u03c6c )\u2212 2 vcF sin \u03b8\u03b3 cos(\u03c6\u03b3 \u2212 \u03c6c )).\nThus for small vF /c a conduction electron is slightly more\nlikely to emit a photon opposite ~kc than along ~kc . Figure 3 shows various plots of the angular distribution in\nthe small vF /c limit, which we will adopt henceforth.\nWhen averaged over the possible momentum directions\nof the conduction electron, the emission or absorption of\na photon depends on the polar angle \u03b8\u03b3 from the normal\nto the graphene sheet like 1\u2212 21 sin2 \u03b8\u03b3 . Because this function falls off more slowly than the Lambertian function\ncos \u03b8, a graphene sheet will appear progressively brighter\n(i.e. blacker) at angles away from normal incidence. At\nthis level of analysis the angular matrix element (12),\nand thus the rate, is zero for the metallic nanotube case\n[19, 20]. The interaction Hamiltonian contains only photons polarized along the nanotube axis, and such photons\ndo not couple the initial and final electronic states.\nThe form of the matrix element (12) indicates that angular momentum conservation is enforced in an unusual\nway in this problem. In a more conventional condensed\nmatter system a typical optical transition involves bands\nwith different orbital angular momentum quantum numbers, and allows the possibility of a spin flip. For instance, in gallium arsenide interband transitions occur\nbetween orbitals with S and P symmetries [21]. Here\nthe transition is 2Pz \u2192 2Pz and there is no spin flip.\nThus the usual sources of angular momentum for the\nphoton do not contribute in graphene. The structure\nof the matrix element (12), which follows directly from\nthe Hamiltonian (3) and the assumption of minimal coupling, implies that the pseudospin flip creates the angular momentum ~ of the photon. We further explore this\n\n\f4\nconnection between pseudospin and angular momentum\nelsewhere [20].\nFor states connected by the \u03b4-functions in Eq. (11), the\nproportionality \u0393c\u2192v \u221d nc (1 \u2212 nv ) (1 + n\u03b3 ) is general,\nand applies whether the n's reflect equilibrium distributions or not. Non-thermal distributions are commonly\nhandled by introducing a quasi-Fermi level that differs\nfor electrons and holes [22]. To simply illustrate the time\nscales relevant for photon-mediated electron-hole recombination, we consider a perfect population inversion, i.e.\nnc = 1 and nv = 0. Integrating (13) over all directions of\nk\u03b3 gives the rate for a conduction electron with energy\nEc = ~\u03c9c = vF ~kc to decay spontaneously (n\u03b3 = 0) via\nphoton emission,\n\u0393c\u2192v =\n\n8\u03b1 \u0010 vF \u00112\n\u03c9c ,\n3\u01ebr c\n\n(14)\n\nwhere \u03b1 = e2 /~c \u2243 1/137 is the fine structure constant.\nThis rate corresponds to a lifetime \u03c4 = 1/\u0393 of about 3 ns\nfor a 1 eV conduction electron.\nFor thermal populations the averaged transition matrix element h|M |2 i = Tr{\u03c1c \u03c1v \u03c1\u03b3 |M |2 }, where the density operators \u03c1 are given by \u03c1 = e\u2212H/kT /Tr{e\u2212H/kT }\nand the trace is taken over the possible occupations:\nn \u2208 [0, 1] for the electrons, and n \u2208 [0, \u221e] for the photons\n[23]. Evaluating the trace gives Bose and Fermi distribution functions,\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n1\n8\u03b1Ec \u0010 vF \u00112\n1\n\u2212\nh\u0393c\u2192v i =\nEc \u2212\u03bc\n\u2212Ec \u2212\u03bc\n3\u01ebr ~ c\ne kT + 1\ne kT + 1\n\u0012\n\u0013\n1\n1 + 2E /kT\n,\n(15)\ne c\n\u22121\nwhere we have allowed for a chemical potential \u03bc. The\nsecond line of (15) shows that recombination stimulated\nby the blackbody background becomes important for\n2Ec = ~\u03c9 . kT . At room temperature with \u03bc = 0 a\nconduction state with energy Ec = kT \u2243 0.025 eV will\nbe populated and decay with a characteristic lifetime of\nabout 400 ns. For many practical purposes this rate is\nnegligible, since, for instance, the second order (Auger)\nprocess gives picosecond lifetimes [24].\nIn contrast, the time-reverse of this recombination process, photon absorption, is observable practically by the\nunaided eye [6, 8]. To analyze absorption we proceed\nas in the derivation of Eqs. (13\u201314), this time considering illumination normally incident on the graphene plane\n(\u03b8\u03b3 = 0) at a rate \u0393i = n\u03b3 cA/\u01ebr V . Then the promotion\nrate \u0393v\u2192c from the valence to the conduction band is\n\u0393v\u2192c = \u03c0\u03b1 (1 \u2212 nc ) nv \u0393i ,\n\n(16)\n\nwhere we have included a factor of 4 for the valley and\n(normal) spin degeneracies. Discounting spontaneous\nemission into the illuminating beam, we take the net absorption rate \u0393abs to be the promotion rate minus the\n\nstimulated emission rate \u221d nc (1 \u2212 nv ) n\u03b3 , which gives\n\u0393abs = \u03c0\u03b1 (nv \u2212 nc )\u0393i .\n\n(17)\n\nWith initial nc = 0 and nv = 1 Eq. (17) reproduces the\n\u03c0\u03b1 result for the optical absorption of a graphene sheet\n[6, 8], and identifies spontaneous emission as the source\nof dissipation. For nc > nv the absorption is negative,\nimplying gain and the possibility of a graphene laser [18,\n25]. As before, thermally averaging (17) replaces the n's\nwith Fermi functions, with the result that the absorption\ngoes to zero for ~\u03c9 \u226a kT or ~\u03c9 \u226a 2|\u03bc|.\nWe can relate the energy absorption rate implied by\n(17) to the conductivity \u03c3 by invoking Ohm's Law,\nwhich implies that the power dissipated per unit area\nis K * E = \u03c3E2 . Here K is the current density and\nE = \u2212 1c \u2202A/\u2202t is the electric field. Since the energy density of the electromagnetic field is \u01ebr E2 /4\u03c0 = n\u03b3 ~\u03c9/V ,\nwe have\n\u03c3=\n\n\u03c0e2\n\u03b1c\n(nv \u2212 nc ) =\n(nv \u2212 nc ),\n4\n2h\n\n(18)\n\nwhich is \u03c0e2 /2h at T = 0. This expression can be written\n\u03c3=\n\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\n\u03c0e2\n~\u03c9 + 2\u03bc\n~\u03c9 \u2212 2\u03bc\ntanh\n+ tanh\n. (19)\n4h\n4kT\n4kT\n\nafter thermal averaging, which is identical to the result\nfound previously [7, 8, 15]. Our calculation, like the previous ones, is not rigorous at \u03c9 = 0, as the dc limit explicitly violates the assumption required to generate the\nenergy \u03b4-function in Eq. (11).\nIn conclusion, we have performed the first calculation\nof graphene's optical properties with a quantized electromagnetic field. The calculation is fully quantum mechanical and free of thermodynamic assumptions until the final step, which allows the treatment of systems far from\nthermal equilibrium. Furthermore, the inherently threedimensional formalism gives amplitudes as a function of\nphoton polarization and propagation direction relative\nto the graphene plane. The dependence on electron and\nphoton state occupation numbers follows directly from\ntheir fermionic and bosonic commutation relations. The\nformer result in Pauli blocking, while the latter give terms\nthat can be identified with spontaneous and stimulated\nemission. Spontaneous emission proves to be a source of\ndissipation present even in idealized graphene, with an\nimplied violation of time-reversal symmetry whose introduction can be traced back to the use of Fermi's Golden\nRule. Stimulated emission from graphene could prove\ntechnologically useful, since an electronic population inversion would allow graphene to serve as the gain medium\nin a laser tunable over a broad band of frequencies.\nThis work was supported in part by the DARPA CERA\nprogram.\n\n\f5\n\n\u2217\n\u2020\n\n[1]\n\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n\n[7]\n[8]\n\n[9]\n[10]\n\nElectronic address: meck0005@physics.ucla.edu\nElectronic address: regan@physics.ucla.edu\nA.
