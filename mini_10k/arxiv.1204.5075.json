Sela1,2\nIn [Se5] we proved that free and torsion-free hyperbolic groups are stable. In this\nnote we give an example of a definable set in each of these groups that is not in\nthe Boolean algebra of equational sets. Hence, the theories of free and torsion-free\nhyperbolic groups are not equational in the sense of G. Srour.\n\nIn [Se5] we proved that free groups and torsion-free hyperbolic groups are stable.\nWe started by proving that a subset of the collection of definable sets in these\ngroups, that are called minimal rank definable sets, are in the Boolean algebra of\nequational sets, and that general varieties and Diophantine sets in these groups\nare equational. Then we used the equationality of Diophantine sets and Duo limit\ngroups and their properties (that are presented in section 3 of [Se5]) to prove that\nfree and torsion-free hyperbolic groups are stable.\nIn this note, we show that our results for minimal rank definable sets are false\nin general. We give an example of a definable set in each free or non-elementary\ntorsion-free hyperbolic group that is not in the Boolean algebra of equational sets.\nRecall that equational sets and theories were defined by Gabriel Srour (see [PiSr]). A definable set D(p, q) is called equational if there exists a constant ND , so\nthat for every sequence of values {qi }m\ni=1 , for which the sequence of sets that corj\nresponds to the intersections: { \u2229i=1 D(p, qi ) }m\nj=1 is a strictly decreasing sequence,\nsatisfies: m \u2264 ND .\nWe note that the question of the existence of a theory which is stable but not\nequational was raised by Pillay and Srour [Pi-Sr], and such examples were constructed by Hrushovski and Srour [Hr-Sr] and Baudisch and Pillay [Ba-Pi].\nTheorem 1. The elementary theory of a non-abelian free group is not equational.\nProof:\n\nLet Fk be a non-abelian free group, and let N E(p, q) be the existential set:\n\u22129\n\u2227 [x1 , x2 ] 6= 1.\nN E(p, q) = \u2203x1 , x2 qp = x10\n1 x2\n\nIn section 3 of [Se5] we introduced duo limit groups (see definition 3.1 in [Se5]).\nWith the set N E(p, q) we associate the following natural duo limit group:\nDuo = < d1 > \u2217<d0 > < d2 > = < t, u > \u2217<u> < u, s > ; q = s10 u ; p = u\u22121 t\u22129 .\nNote that if we fix a value of the variable u, i.e., we fix a rectangle that is associated\nwith the duo limit group Duo, then for every (fixed) non-trivial value of the variable\n1 Hebrew\n\nUniversity, Jerusalem 91904, Israel.\nsupported by an Israel academy of sciences fellowship.\n\n2 Partially\n\n\fs, a couple (q(s), p(t)) is in the set N E(p, q) for every generic value of the variable\nt, and correspondingly for every (fixed) non-trivial value of t and a generic value of\ns.\nLemma 2. The set N E(p, q) is not equational.\nProof: If we fix a value u0 for the variable u, and a non-trivial value s0 for the\nvariable s, so that q(s0 ) = s10\n0 u0 , then for all values of the variable t for which\n\u22129\n[t, s0 ] 6= 1, the couple (q(s0 ), p(t)) \u2208 N E(p, q) where p(t) = u\u22121\n. A work of\n0 t\nLyndon and Schutzenberger [Ly-Sch], shows that for m, n, r \u2265 2, the solutions of the\nequation xm y n z r = 1 in a free group, generate a cyclic subgroup. Hence, for all but\nat most 2 values t0 of the variable t, for which [s0 , t0 ] = 1, (q(s0 ), q(t0 )) \u2208\n/ N E(p, q).\nHence, if we consider a sequence, s1 , s2 , . . . , where [si1 , si2 ] 6= 1 for i1 < i2 , then the\nsequence of intersections: {\u2229ji=1 N E(p, q(si))}\u221e\nj=1 is a strictly decreasing sequence.\nTherefore, N E(p, q) is not equational.\n\u0003\nSince a finite union and a finite intersection of equational sets are equational (see\ncorollary 2.27 in [OH]), lemma 2 implies that the set N E(p, q) is not a finite union\nnor a finite intersection of equational sets.\nLemma 3. The set N E(p, q) is not co-equational (i.e., it is not the complement\nof an equational set).\nProof: The (infinite) union of the sets N E(p, qi ), for all possible values of qi , is\nthe entire coefficient group Fk . Every finite subunion of such sets is a proper subset\nof Fk (since the set N E(p, q) is not of generic type or is negligible in the sense of\nM. Bestvina and M. Feighn [Be-Fe]). Hence, N E(p, q) can not be co-equational.\n\u0003\nTo prove that the theory of a free group is not equational, we need to show\nthat the set N E(p, q) is not a union nor an intersection of an equational and a\nco-equational sets.\nLemma 4. The set N E(p, q) is not a union of an equational and a co-equational\nsets.\nProof: Suppose that N E(p, q) = E1 \u222a (E2 )c where E1 , E2 are equational sets.\nLet N1 , N2 be the bounds on the lengths of sequences with strictly decreasing intersections: {E1 (p, qi )} and {E2 (p, qj )}. Let N = max(N1 , N2 ). We look at a sequence\n10\n\u22121 i \u22129 N+1\ni\n}i,j=1 , where {sij } and {ui }\nof values: {qji = (sij ) ui }N+1\ni,j=1 , and {pj = ui (sj )\nare distinct elements in a given test sequence (i.e., they satisfy the combinatorial\nproperties that are listed in definition 1.20 in [Se2] for a test sequence. Elements\nin a test sequence should be considered \"generic\" elements, that as a set satisfy a\nvery small cancellation condition).\nSince the elements {ui } and the elements {sij } are chosen to be generic (part of\n\u2032\na test sequence), a pair, (pij , qji \u2032 ) \u2208 N E(p, q) if and only if i = i\u2032 and j 6= j \u2032 . Hence,\nfor a given index i, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 N + 1, and every index j, 1 \u2264 j \u2264 N + 1, E2 (p, qji )\n\u2032\ncontains all the elements pij , i 6= i\u2032 , 1 \u2264 i, i\u2032 , j < N + 1.\nOur choice of N guarantees that a sequence of sets of the form, {E2 (p, qji )},\nwith strictly decreasing intersections, has length bounded by N . Therefore, there\n2\n\n\fmust exist some index i0 , 1 \u2264 i0 \u2264 N + 1, for which for every 1 \u2264 j, j \u2032 \u2264 N + 1:\npij0 \u2208 E2 (p, qji0\u2032 ).\nHence, for this index i0 , pij0 \u2208 E1 (p, qji0\u2032 ), if and only if pij0 \u2208 N E(p, qji0\u2032 ), 1 \u2264\nj, j \u2032 \u2264 N + 1. pij0 \u2208 N E(p, qji0\u2032 ) if and only if j 6= j \u2032 . Therefore, the sequence of\ni0 N+1\nintersections: {\u2229m\nj=1 E1 (p, qj )}m=1 is a strictly decreasing sequence, a contradiction\nto the assumption that N is the global bound on the length of such a strictly\ndecreasing sequence.\n\u0003\nUsing a somewhat similar argument one can show that N E(p, q) is not the\nintersection of an equational and a co-equational sets.\nLemma 5. The set N E(p, q) is not an intersection between an equational and a\nco-equational sets.\nProof: Suppose that N E(p, q) = E1 \u2229 (E2 )c where E1 , E2 are equational sets. Let\nN1 , N2 be the bounds on the lengths of strictly decreasing sequences: {E1 (p, qi )}\nand {E2 (p, qj )}, and let N = max(N1 , N2 ). We look at a sequence of values:\n(10j )\n\n(1\u221210j )\n\ni\ni\n}, where {vi } and {wi }\n}N+1\n{si = (vi )10 (wi )\u22129 }N+1\ni,j=1 , {pj = si\ni=1 , {qj = si\nare distinct elements in a given test sequence (\"generic\" elements).\nSince the elements {vi } and {wi } are chosen to be generic (part of a test se\u2032\nquence), a pair, (pij , qji \u2032 ) \u2208 N E(p, q), if and only if i 6= i\u2032 or i = i\u2032 and j = j \u2032 .\nHence, for a given index i, 1 \u2264 i \u2264 N + 1, and every index j, 1 \u2264 j \u2264 N + 1,\n\u2032\nE1 (p, qji ) contains the element pij , and all the elements pij \u2032 , i 6= i\u2032 , 1 \u2264 i\u2032 , j \u2032 < N + 1.\nOur choice of N guarantees that a sequence of sets of the form, {E1 (p, qji )},\nwith strictly decreasing intersections, has length bounded by N . Therefore, there\nmust exist some index i0 , 1 \u2264 i0 \u2264 N + 1, for which for every 1 \u2264 j, j \u2032 \u2264 N + 1:\npij0 \u2208 E1 (p, qji0\u2032 ).\n\nFor this index i0 , pij0 \u2208 (E2 )c (p, qji0\u2032 ), if and only if pij0 \u2208 N E(p, qji0\u2032 ), 1 \u2264 j, j \u2032 \u2264\nN + 1. pij0 \u2208 N E(p, qji0\u2032 ) if and only if j = j \u2032 . Hence, pij0 \u2208 E2 (p, qji0\u2032 ) if and only if\ni0 N+1\nj 6= j \u2032 . Therefore, the sequence of intersections: {\u2229m\nj=1 E1 (p, qj )}m=1 is a strictly\ndecreasing sequence, a contradiction to the assumption that N is the global bound\non the length of such a strictly decreasing sequence.\n\u0003\nSo far we proved that the set N E(p, q) is not an intersection nor a union of an\nequational and a co-equational sets. Since a finite union and a finite intersection of\nequational sets are equational, to prove that the set N E(p, q) is not in the Boolean\nalgebra of equational sets it is enough to prove that N E(p, q) is not a finite union of\nintersections between an equational and a co-equational sets. Hence, to prove that\nthe set N E(p, q) is not in the Boolean algebra of equational sets, for every positive\ninteger l, we need to find a collection of elements in the definable set N E(p, q), so\nthat this collection of elements can not be contained in a union of l intersections\nof an equational set and a co-equational set.\nUnlike the previous lemmas, to prove that we (indirectly) use the structure of\na definable set over a free group that is the outcome of the quantifier elimination\nprocedure [Se3]. This (geometric) structure of definable sets was used in proving\nthe stability of the theory (see theorems 1.9 and 5.1 in [Se5]). Technically, to prove\ntheorem 1 (proposition 6 and theorem 7) we use envelopes of definable sets over a\n3\n\n\ffree group, as they appeared and proved to exist in section 1 in [Se6]. For presentation purposes we start by proving that the set N E(p, q) is not the union of two\nintersections of equational and co-equational sets (proposition 6), and then generalize the argument to prove that N E(p, q) is not a finite union of such intersections\n(theorem 7).\nProposition 6. The set N E(p, q) is not a union of two intersections between an\nequational and a co-equational sets.\nProof: Our approach to prove the proposition combines the argument that was\nused to prove lemma 5 with the envelope of a definable set and its properties as\nthey are presented and proved to exist in theorem 1.3 in [Se6].\nSuppose that:\nN E(p, q) = (E11 \u2229 (E21 )c ) \u222a (E12 \u2229 (E22 )c ).\nLet N be the maximum in the finite set of equationality constants of the sets, Ei1 ,\nEi2 , and Ei1 \u2229 Ei2 , i = 1, 2.\nWe modify the argument that was used to prove lemma 5, and the definition of\nthe elements pij and qji in the proof of that lemma. We set:\nq = (((t1 )10 (s1 )\u22129 )10m1 ((t2 )10 (s2 )\u22129 )\u22129m2 )10f1 u\np = u\u22121 (((t3 )10 (s3 )\u22129 )10m3 ((t4 )10 (s4 )\u22129 )\u22129m4 )\u22129f2 .\nWe look at the collection of all the test sequences of values for the variables,\n{tj , sj }4j=1 and u, (recall that elements in a test sequence need to satisfy the properties that are listed in definition 1.20 in [Se2], they satisfy a very small cancellation\nassumption, and should be considered \"generic\" elements). For all the values in\nsuch test sequences, and arbitrary positive integer values of the elements, {mj }4j=1\nand f1 , f2 , the corresponding values of the variables (p, q) are in the set N E(p, q).\nBy our assumptions, for each (p0 , q0 ) \u2208 N E(p, q), (p0 , q0 ) \u2208 E1i \u2229 (E2i )c for i = 1\nor i = 2, hence, in particular, (p0 , q0 ) \u2208 E1i for i = 1 or i = 2. For i = 1, 2, we\nlook at the collection of all the test sequences of elements, {tj , sj }4j=1 and u, and\nsequences of positive integers as values for the elements, {mj }4j=1 and f1 , f2 , for\nwhich each of the sequences of values of each of the elements, {mj }4j=1 and f1 , f2 ,\nconverges to infinity, and the corresponding sequence of values of the pair (p, q) are\nall in the set E1i .\nBy definition, the group that is generated by the elements, {tj , sj }4j=1 and u, p, q,\ntogether with elements that are (formally) added for the powers: ((tj )10 (sj )\u22129 )10mj ,\nj = 1, . . . , 4, (each such formal power commutes with the corresponding element:\n(tj )10 (sj )\u22129 , j = 1, . . . , 4), is a completion (i.e., an \u03c9-residually free tower - see\nsection 6 in [Se1] and definition 1.12 in [Se2]), with a bottom level which is a free\ngroup of rank 9 (that is generated by the elements, tj , sj , j = 1, . . . , 4 and u, and\ntwo upper levels, where at the first level above the bottom level, there are 4 abelian\nvertex groups of rank 2 that are connected to a distinguished vertex, and in the top\nlevel there are additional two abelian vertex groups of rank 2 that are connected\nto a distinguished vertex. We denote this completion, Comp.\nThe subgroup Comp is a completion, and generic points (test sequences) in\nits associated variety project to values of the pair, (p, q), that are in N E(p, q),\n4\n\n\fand hence are in E1i (p, q) for i = 1 or i = 2. Therefore, by the construction of\nenvelopes of definable sets, as they are presented in theorem 1.3 in [Se6], with\nthe sets, E1i (p, q), i = 1, 2, there are associated envelopes, that are closures of the\ncompletion, Comp.\nHence, with the sets E11 , E12 , there are associated closures of Comp, that we denote Cl1 , . . . , Cld , that form the envelopes of the sets E11 , E12 , with respect to generic\npoints (test sequences) of the completion, Comp. Furthermore, with each closure,\nClg , there exists a finite (possibly empty) closures of it, Clg,1 , . . . , Clg,fg . By the\nproperties of envelopes (see theorem 1.3 in [Se6]), the set of closures Cl1 , . . . , Cld\nand their associated closures,Cl1,1 , . . . , Clg,fg , specifies precisely what test sequences\nof the completion, Comp, restrict to values of the variables (p, q) that are in the\nsets, E11 and E12 (and what test sequences restrict to values of (p, q) that are in the\ncomplements of each of these sets).\nWe now look at a specific test sequence of values for the variables, tj , sj , j =\n1, . . . , 4 and u, together with a specific sequence of positive integers as values for\nthe elements, {mj }4j=1 and f1 , f2 , for which: m1 = m3 , m2 = m4 , 10m1 \u2212 9m2 = 1,\nand 10f2 \u2212 9f1 = 1. In the sequel we will denote this specific test sequence,\n{tj (n), sj (n)}, j = 1, . . . , 4, u(n), and mj (n), j = 1, . . . , 4 and f1 (n), f2 (n).\nWith the collection of all the test sequences of the completion, Comp, we have associated finitely many envelope closures, Cl1 , . . . , Cld , and with each closure Clg we\nhave further associated finally many (possibly no) closures of it, Clg,1 , . . . , Clg,f (g).\nWith each of these closures there is an associated finite index subgroup of some\nfixed f.g. free abelian group, so we may look at the intersection of all these finite\nindex subgroups. Hence, with each closure there are finitely many associated cosets\nof this finite index subgroup. By passing to a subsequence we may assume that all\nthe elements in the specific test sequence that we chose belong to a fixed coset of\nthat finite index subgroup.\nNow, for each index n (of the specific test sequence that we chose), we look at\nthe following sequence of values for 1 \u2264 g, h \u2264 N + 1 (that is similar to the one\nthat we used in proving lemma 5):\nqhg (n) = (((t1 (n+g))10 (s1 (n+g))\u22129 )10m1 (n) ((t2 (n+g))10 (s2 (n+g))\u22129 )\u22129m2 (n) )10f1 (n+h) u(n)\npgh (n) = u(n)\u22121 (((t1 (n+g))10 (s1 (n+g))\u22129 )10m1 (n) ((t2 (n+g))10 (s2 (n+g))\u22129 )\u22129m2 (n) )\u22129f2 (n+h) .\nBy the way the values of the sequence is defined, and like in lemma 5, for every\n\u2032\nindex n: (pgh (n), qhg \u2032 (n)) \u2208 N E(p, q), if and only if g 6= g \u2032 or g = g \u2032 and h = h\u2032\n(1 \u2264 g, g \u2032 , h, h\u2032 \u2264 N + 1).\nSince we have chosen the positive integers, mj (n), j = 1, . . . , 4, and f1 (n), f2 (n),\nto be from a fixed class of the finite index subgroup that is associated with the\nclosures, Cl1 , . . . , cld , and Cl1,1 , . . . , Cld,f (d) , for every index n, and every g 6= g \u2032 ,\n1 \u2264 h, h\u2032 , g, g \u2032 \u2264 N + 1, precisely one of the following two possibilities is valid:\n\u2032\n\n(1) (pgh (n), qhg \u2032 (n)) \u2208 E11 \u2229 E12 .\n\u2032\n(2) there exists a fixed index i, (wlog we may assume i = 1), so that: (pgh (n), qhg \u2032 (n)) \u2208\n\u2032\nE11 and (pgh (n), qhg \u2032 (n)) \u2208\n/ E12 .\nIf possibility (1) is valid, then we apply the same argument that was used to prove\nlemma 5, to the equational set E11 \u2229 E12 , and the co-equational set, (E21 \u2229 E22 )c , and\nobtain a contradiction. Hence, we may assume that possibility (2) is valid.\n5\n\n\fIf possibility (2) holds, then by the equationality of the set E11 and the argument\nthat was used to prove lemma 5, there exists an index g0 , 1 \u2264 g0 \u2264 N + 1, for which\nfor every h, h\u2032 , 1 \u2264 h, h\u2032 \u2264 N + 1, (pgh0 (n), qhg0\u2032 (n)) \u2208 E11 . Since (pgh0 (n), qhg0\u2032 (n)) \u2208\nN E(p, q) if and only if h = h\u2032 , the equationality of the set E21 and the argument that\nwas used in proving lemma 5, imply that there exists an index h0 , 1 \u2264 h0 \u2264 N + 1,\nfor which for every index h\u2032 , 1 \u2264 h\u2032 \u2264 N + 1, (pgh0\u2032 (n), qhg00 (n)) \u2208 E21 . In particular,\n(pgh00 (n), qhg00 (n)) \u2208 E21 . Since (pgh00 (n), qhg00 (n)) \u2208 N E(p, q) \u2229 E11 \u2229 E21 and:\nN E(p, q) = (E11 \u2229 (E21 )c ) \u222a (E12 \u2229 (E22 )c )\nit finally follows that (pgh00 (n), qhg00 (n)) \u2208 E11 \u2229 E12 .\nNow, note that the pairs, (pgh00 (n), qhg00 (n)), can be written as:\nqhg00 (n) = (((t1 (n+g0 ))10 (s1 (n+g0 ))\u22129 )10m1 (n) ((t2 (n+g0 ))10 (s2 (n+g0 ))\u22129 )\u22129m2 (n) )10f1 (n+h0 ) u(n) =\n= ((t1 (n + g0 ))10 (s1 (n + g0 ))\u22129 )10m1 (n) \u00fb(n)\npgh00 (n) = u(n)\u22121 (((t1 (n+g0 ))10 (s1 (n+g0 ))\u22129 )10m1 (n) ((t2 (n+g0 ))10 (s2 (n+g0 ))\u22129 )\u22129m2 (n) )\u22129f2 (n+h0 ) =\n= \u00fb(n)\u22121 ((t2 (n + g0 ))10 (s2 (n + g0 ))\u22129 )\u22129m2 (n)\nwhere the sequences, {tj (n)}, {sj (n)}, j = 1, 2, and {\u00fb(n)}, are test sequences, and\nthe sequence {m1 (n), m2 (n)} is a sequence of positive integers for which for every\nindex n, 10m1 (n) \u2212 9m2 (n) = 1.\nAt this stage we essentially repeat what we did so far with the previous values of\nthe pair p, q (that were only in the set E11 by possibility (2)), for the new sequence\nof values of this pair that are now known to be in the intersection E11 \u2229 E12 .\nBy definition, the group that is generated by the elements, {tj , sj }2j=1 and \u00fb, p, q,\ntogether with elements that are (formally) added for the powers: ((tj )10 (sj )\u22129 )10mj ,\nj = 1, 2, (each such formal power commutes with the corresponding element:\n(tj )10 (sj )\u22129 , j = 1, 2), is a completion, with a bottom level which is a free group\nof rank 5 (that is generated by the elements, tj , sj , j = 1, 2 and \u00fb, and an upper\nlevel, in which there are 2 abelian vertex groups of rank 2 that are connected to a\ndistinguished vertex. We denote this completion, Comp1 .\nThe subgroup Comp1 is a completion, and the given sequence of values (tj (n +\ng0 ), sj (n + g0 ), j = 1, 2, \u00fb(n), m1 (n), m2 (n)) is a test sequence of values of Comp1 ,\nthat projects to values of the pair, (p, q), that are in N E(p, q), and in E11 (p, q) \u2229 E12 .\nBy the construction of envelopes of definable sets, as they are presented in theorem\n1.3 in [Se6], with the intersection, E11 \u2229E12 , and the collection of all the test sequences\nof Comp1 that restrict to values of the pair p, q that are in E11 \u2229 E12 , it is possible to\ncanonically associate finitely many envelopes, that are closures of the completion,\nComp1 . Since there exists a test sequence of Comp1 that restricts to values of the\npair p, q that are in the set E11 \u2229 E12 , this collection of envelopes is not empty.\nHence, with the intersection E11 \u2229 E12 , there are associated closures of Comp1 ,\nthat we denote Cl11 , . . . , Cld11 , that form the envelopes of the sets E11 \u2229 E12 , with\nrespect to generic points (test sequences) of the completion, Comp1 . Furthermore, with each closure, Clr1 , there exists a finite (possibly empty) closures of it,\n1\n1\nClr,1\n, . . . , Clr,f\n. By the properties of envelopes (see theorem 1.3 in [Se6]), the set\nr\n1\n1\n1\nof closures Cl1 , . . . , Cld11 and their associated closures,Cl1,1\n, . . . , Clr,f\n, specifies\nr\n6\n\n\fprecisely what test sequences of the completion, Comp1 , restrict to values of the\nvariables (p, q) that are in the set, E11 \u2229 E12 .\nWe now look at a subsequence of the original test sequence, tj (n), sj (n), j = 1, 2,\nand \u00fb(n), together with a specific sequence of positive integers as values for the\nelements, {m1 (n), m2 (n)}, for which: 10m1 \u2212 9m2 = 1.\nWith the collection of all the test sequences of the completion, Comp1 , we have\nassociated finitely many envelope closures. With each of these closures there is an\nassociated finite index subgroup of some fixed f.g. free abelian group, so we may\nlook at the intersection of all these finite index subgroups. Hence, with each closure\nthere are finitely many associated cosets of this finite index subgroup. By passing\nto a subsequence we may assume that all the elements in the specific test sequence\nthat we chose belong to a fixed coset of that finite index subgroup.\nNow, for each index n (of the specific test sequence that we chose), we look at\nthe following sequence of values for 1 \u2264 g, h \u2264 N + 1 (that is once again similar to\nthe one that we used in proving lemma 5):\nqhg (n) = ((t1 (n + g))10 (s1 (n + g))\u22129 )10m1 (n+h) \u00fb(n)\npgh (n) = \u00fb(n)\u22121 ((t1 (n + g))10 (s1 (n + g))\u22129 )\u22129m2 (n+h) .\nBy the way the values of the sequence is defined, and like in lemma 5, for every\n\u2032\nindex n: (pgh (n), qhg \u2032 (n)) \u2208 N E(p, q), if and only if g 6= g \u2032 or g = g \u2032 and h = h\u2032\n(1 \u2264 g, g \u2032 , h, h\u2032 \u2264 N + 1). Furthermore, since we have chosen the positive integers,\nm1 (n), m2 (n), to be from a fixed class of the finite index subgroup that is associated\nwith the envelope closures of E21 \u2229 E12 with respect to the completion Comp1 , for\n\u2032\nevery index n, and every g 6= g \u2032 , 1 \u2264 h, h\u2032 , g, g \u2032 \u2264 N + 1, (pgh (n), qhg \u2032 (n)) \u2208 E11 \u2229 E12 .\nAt this stage we apply the same argument that was used to prove lemma 5,\nto the equational set E11 \u2229 E12 , and the co-equational set, (E21 \u2229 E22 )c , and obtain\na contradiction. Hence, N E(p, q) is not the union of two intersections between\nequational and co-equational sets, and proposition 6 follows.\n\u0003\nProposition 6 proves that the set N E(p, q) is not the union of two intersections\nof equational and co-equational sets. Theorem 7 generalizes the proof to prove that\nN E(p, q) is not a finite union of such intersections.\nTheorem 7. The set N E(p, q) is not a finite union of intersections between an\nequational and a co-equational sets.\nProof: The argument that we use is a straightforward generalization of the argument that was used to prove proposition 6. Suppose that:\nN E(p, q) = (E11 \u2229 (E21 )c ) \u222a . . . \u222a (E1l \u2229 (E2l )c )\nLet Ma1 ,... ,ab (p, q) = E1a1 \u2229 . . . \u2229 E1ab , and Ta1 ,... ,ab (p, q) = E2a1 \u2229 . . . \u2229 E2ab ,\nfor 1 \u2264 b \u2264 l, and 1 \u2264 a1 < . . . < ab \u2264 l. Since the sets, E1a and E2a ,\na = 1, . . . , l, are equational, so are the sets Ma1 ,... ,ab and Ta1 ,... ,ab . Let N be\na bound on the lengths of strictly decreasing sequences: {\u2229fj=1 Ma1 ,... ,ad (p, qj )}rf =1\nand {\u2229fj=1 Ta1 ,... ,ad (p, qj )}rf =1 , for all 1 \u2264 d \u2264 l and 1 \u2264 a1 < . . . < ad \u2264 l.\n7\n\n\fWe modify the argument that was used to prove proposition 6, and the definition\nof the elements pgh and qhg in the proof of that proposition. We set:\nv10 = (t1 )10 (s1 )\u22129 , . . . , v20l = (t2l )10 (s2l )\u22129\nand then define the upper level elements iteratively:\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\n1\n\nv11 = (v10 )10m1 (v20 )\u22129k1 , . . . , v21l\u22121 = (v20l \u22121 )10m2l\u22121 (v20l )\u22129k2l\u22121\nr\n\n1\n\n1\n\nr\n\n\u22129k2l\u2212r\n10m2l\u2212r\n(v2r\u22121\nv1r = (v1r\u22121 )10m1 (v2r\u22121 )\u22129k1 , . . . , v2rl\u2212r = (v2r\u22121\nl\u2212r+1 )\nl\u2212r+1 \u22121 )\nl\n\nl\n\nfor 1 \u2264 r \u2264 l. Note that finally: v1l = (v1ell\u22121 )10m1 (v2l\u22121 )\u22129k1 . We further set\nl\nl\nq = (v1l\u22121 )10m1 u and p = u\u22121 (v2l\u22121 )\u22129k1 .\nWe look at the collection of all the test sequences of values for the variables,\nl\n{tj , sj }2j=1 and u. Recall that elements in a test sequence need to satisfy the properties that are listed in definition 1.20 in [Se2], they satisfy a very small cancellation\nassumption, and should be considered \"generic\" elements. For all the values in such\ntest sequences, and arbitrary positive integer values of the elements, {mrj } and kjr ,\nthe corresponding values of the variables (p, q) are in the set N E(p, q).\nBy our assumptions, for each (p0 , q0 ) \u2208 N E(p, q), there exists (at least one) index\na, 1 \u2264 a \u2264 l, for which (p0 , q0 ) \u2208 E1a \u2229 (E2a )c . Hence, in particular, (p0 , q0 ) \u2208 E1a .\nFor each index a, 1 \u2264 a \u2264 l, we look at the collection of all the test sequences\nl\nof elements, {tj , sj }2j=1 and u, and sequences of positive integers, {mrj } and {kjr },\nfor which each of the sequences, {mrj } and {kjr }, converges to infinity, and the\ncorresponding sequence of values of the pair (p, q) are all in the set E1a .\nBy the iterative definition of the elements vjr , the group that is generated by the\nelements: tj , sj , j = 1, . . . , 2l , u, and vjr , 0 \u2264 r \u2264 l \u2212 1, 1 \u2264 j \u2264 2l\u2212r , together with\nelements that represent formal powers of the elements vjr (each such formal power\ncommutes with the corresponding element vjr ), is a completion (i.e., an \u03c9-residually\nfree tower - see section 6 in [Se1] and definition 1.12 in [Se2]). This completion has\na bottom level which is a free group of rank 2l+1 + 1 (that is generated by u and\nl\n{tj , sj }2j=1 ), and l upper levels, where at level r, 1 \u2264 r \u2264 l, there are 2l\u2212r+1\nabelian vertex groups, each of them of rank 2 and connected to the lower level with\na cyclic edge group (that is generated by one of the elements vjr ). We denote this\ncompletion, Comp.\nThe subgroup Comp is a completion, and the projection of generic points (test\nsequences) in its associated variety project to values of the pair, (p, q), that are\nin N E(p, q), and hence are in E1a (p, q) for some index a, 1 \u2264 a \u2264 l. Therefore,\nby the construction of envelopes of definable sets, as they are presented in section\n1 of [Se6] (see theorem 1.3 in [Se6]), with some of the groups, E1a (p, q), there are\nassociated envelopes, that are closures of the completion, Comp.\nHence, with a (non-empty) subcollection of the sets E11 , . . . , E1l , there are associated closures of Comp, that we denote Cl1 , . . . , Cld (which are the envelopes\nof the completion Comp with respect to the collection of sets, {E1a }). Furthermore, with each closure, Clg , there exists a finite (possibly empty) closures of it,\nClg,1 , . . . , Clg,fg . By the properties of envelopes (see theorem 1.3 in [Se6]), the set\nof closures Cl1 , . . . , Cld and their associated closures,Cl1,1 , . . . , Clg,f (g), specifies\nprecisely what test sequences of the completion, Comp, restrict to values of the\nvariables (p, q) that are in the sets, E11 , . . . , E1l .\n8\n\n\fl\n\nWe now look at a specific test sequence of values for the variables, {tj (n), sj (n)}2j=1\nand u(n), together with a specific sequences of positive integers, {mrj (n)} and\n{kjr (n)}, for which the integer values, mrj (n) and kjr (n), do not depend on the\nindices r or j, 10mrj (n) \u2212 9kjr (n) = 1, and the sequences mrj (n) and kjr (n), converge\nto infinity.\nWith the collection of all the test sequences of the completion, Comp, we have associated finitely many envelope closures, Cl1 , . . . , Cld , and with each closure Clg we\nhave further associated finally many (possibly no) closures of it, Clg,1 , . . . , Clg,f (g).\nWith each of these closures there is an associated finite index subgroup of some\nfixed f.g. free abelian group, so we may look at the intersection of all these finite\nindex subgroups. Hence, with each closure there are finitely many associated cosets\nof this finite index subgroup. By passing to a subsequence we may assume that all\nthe elements in the specific test sequence that we chose belong to a fixed coset of\nthat finite index subgroup.\nFor each index n (of the specific test sequence that we chose), we look at the\nfollowing sequence of values (that is similar to the one that we used in proving\nproposition 6 and lemma 5):\nl\n\nl\n\ng\n\u22121\n{qhg (n) = (v1l\u22121 (n+g))10m1 (n+h) u(n)}N+1\n(v1l\u22121 (n+g))\u22129k1 (n+h) }N+1\ng,h=1 ; {ph (n) = u(n)\ng,h=1 .\n\nBy the way the elements vjr are defined, and since we chose the elements {tj (n), sj (n)},\nmrj (n) and kjr (n) ,from our fixed test sequence, like in proposition 6 and lemma 5:\n\u2032\n\n(pgh (n), qhg \u2032 (n)) \u2208 N E(p, q), if and only if g 6= g \u2032 or g = g \u2032 and h = h\u2032 .\nSince we have chosen the positive integers, mrj (n) and kjr (n), to be from a fixed\nclass of the finite index subgroup that is associated with the closures, Cl1 , . . . , cld ,\nand Cl1,1 , . . . , Cld,f (d) , there exists a positive integer b, 1 \u2264 b \u2264 l, and indices\n\u2032\n\n1 \u2264 a1 < . . . < ab \u2264 l, so that for every index n, the pair (qhg (n), pgh\u2032 (n)) \u2208 E1a for\ng 6= g \u2032 and 1 \u2264 g, g \u2032, h, h\u2032 \u2264 N + 1, if and only if a is one of the indices a1 , . . . , ab .\nIf b = l, then we apply the same argument that was used to prove lemma 5, to\nthe equational set E11 \u2229 . . . \u2229 E1l , and the co-equational set, (E21 \u2229 . . . \u2229 E2l )c , and\nobtain a contradiction. Hence, we may assume that 1 \u2264 b < l.\nLet Mb = E1a1 \u2229 . . . \u2229 E1ab , and Tb = E2a1 \u2229 . . . \u2229 E2ab . By the equationality\nof the set Tb , and the argument that was used to prove lemma 5, there exists\nan index g0 , 1 \u2264 g0 \u2264 N + 1, for which for every h, h\u2032 , 1 \u2264 h, h\u2032 \u2264 N + 1,\n(pgh0 (n), qhg0\u2032 (n)) \u2208 Tb .

We\ndenote this completion, Comp1 .\nThe subgroup Comp1 is a completion, and the given sequence of values (tj (n +\ng0 ), sj (n+g0 ), j = 1, . . . , 2l\u22121 , \u00fb(n), vjr (n+g0 ), mrj (n+g0 ), kjr (n+g0 ), 0 \u2264 r \u2264 l\u22122,\n1 \u2264 j \u2264 2l\u22121\u2212r ) is a test sequence of values of Comp1 , that projects to values of\nthe pair, (p, q), that are in N E(p, q). Furthermore, by our conclusion, these values\nof the pair (p, q) are in the set Mb \u2229 E1a , where 1 \u2264 a \u2264 l, and a 6= a1 , . . . , ab .\nThe values of the pair (p, q) in our given sequence are contained in Mb \u2229 E1a . We\npass to a further subsequence, so that the values of (p, q) are contained in a maximal\nintersection Mb \u2229 E1e1 . . . \u2229 E1es , where 1 \u2264 e1 < e2 < . . . < es \u2264 l, 1 \u2264 s, and each\nof elements ei 6= a1 , . . . , ab . We set b\u2032 = b + s and Mb\u2032 = Mb \u2229 E1e1 . . . \u2229 E1es . Note\nthat 1 \u2264 b < b\u2032 \u2264 l. Since we assume that the set, e1 , . . . , es , is a maximal set, no\nproper subsequence of the given set of values of the pair (p, q), is contained in a set\nMb\u2032 \u2229 E1f , where 1 \u2264 f \u2264 l, and f 6= a1 , . . . , ab , e1 , . . . , es .\nBy the construction of envelopes of definable sets, as they are presented in theorem 1.3 in [Se6], with the equational set Mb\u2032 , and the collection of all the test\nsequences of Comp1 that restrict to values of the pair p, q that are in Mb\u2032 , it is\npossible to canonically associate finitely many envelopes, that are closures of the\ncompletion, Comp1 . Since there exists a test sequence of Comp1 that restricts to\nvalues of the pair p, q that are in the set Mb\u2032 , this collection of envelopes is not\nempty.\nHence, with the equational set Mb\u2032 , there are associated closures of Comp1 , that\nform the envelopes of the set Mb\u2032 , with respect to generic points (test sequences) of\nthe completion, Comp1 . Furthermore, with each such envelope closure there exists\na finite (possibly empty) collection of closures of it. By the properties of envelopes\n(see theorem 1.3 in [Se6]), the set of envelope closures and their associated closures,\nspecifies precisely what test sequences of the completion, Comp1 , restrict to values\nof the variables (p, q) that are in the set, Mb\u2032 .\nWe now look at the original test sequence of the completion Comp1 . With the\ncollection of all the test sequences of the completion, Comp1 , we have associated\nfinitely many envelope closures. With each of these closures there is an associated\nfinite index subgroup of some fixed f.g. free abelian group, so we may look at the\nintersection of all these finite index subgroups. Hence, with each closure there\nare finitely many associated cosets of this finite index subgroup. By passing to a\nsubsequence of the original test sequence of Comp1 , we may assume that all the\n10\n\n\felements in the specific test sequence that we chose belong to a fixed coset of that\nfinite index subgroup.\nNow, for each index n (of the specific test sequence that we chose), we look at\nthe following sequence of values for the pair (p, q) and for indices, 1 \u2264 g, h \u2264 N + 1\n(that is once again similar to the one that we used in proving lemma 5):\nl\u22121\n\nqhg (n) = (v1l\u22122 (n + g))10m1\n\n(n+h)\n\n\u00fb(n)\n\nl\u22121\n\npgh (n) = \u00fb(n)\u22121 (v1l\u22122 (n + g))\u22129k1\n\n(n+h)\n\n.\n\nBy the way the values of the sequence is defined, and like in proposition 6 and\n\u2032\nlemma 5, for every index n: (pgh (n), qhg \u2032 (n)) \u2208 N E(p, q), if and only if g 6= g \u2032 or\ng = g \u2032 and h = h\u2032 (1 \u2264 g, g \u2032, h, h\u2032 \u2264 N + 1). Furthermore, since we have chosen\nthe positive integers, mrj (n), kjr (n), to be from a fixed class of the finite index\nsubgroup that is associated with the envelope closures of Mb\u2032 with respect to the\ncompletion Comp1 , for every index n, and every g 6= g \u2032 , 1 \u2264 h, h\u2032 , g, g \u2032 \u2264 N + 1,\n\u2032\n(pgh (n), qhg \u2032 (n)) \u2208 Mb\u2032 .\n1 \u2264 b < b\u2032 \u2264 l. If b\u2032 = l, we get a contradiction by the argument that was used\nto prove lemma 5. Hence, b\u2032 < l. In that case we repeat the argument that we\nused for the first test sequence of values of (p, q), and use the equationality of Mb\u2032\nto prove the existence of indices, g0 , h0 for every index n, so that for every index\nn there exists an index a(n), 1 \u2264 a(n) \u2264 l, and a(n) 6= a1 , . . . , ab , e1 , . . . , es for\na(n)\nwhich: (pgh00 (n), qhg00 (n)) \u2208 Mb \u2229 E1 .\nTherefore, after passing to a subsequence and repeating the same argument that\nwe used for the first test sequence, it is possible to enlarge the index b\u2032 to b\u2032\u2032 = b\u2032 +s\u2032 ,\nand obtain a completion Comp2 with a test sequence that restricts to values of the\npair (p, q) that are in the set Mb\u2032\u2032 . Repeating this argument iteratively, after less\nthan l \u2212 1 steps we can construct a sequence with similar properties, so that the\nvalues of the pair (p, q) is in the set E11 \u2229 . . . \u2229 E1l . Hence the same argument that\nwas used to prove lemma 5, that is applied to the equational set E11 \u2229 . . . \u2229 E1l and\nthe co-equational set E21 \u2229 . . . \u2229 E2l gives a contradiction, and finally proves theorem\n7.\n\u0003\nSince the union and the intersection of equational sets are equational, theorem\n7 proves that N E(p, q) is not in the Boolean algebra of equational sets, hence that\nthe theory of a free group is not equational. This concludes the proof of theorem 1.\n\u0003\nThe results of [Se4] allow one to modify the argument that was used to prove theorem 1, and generalize theorem 1 to every non-elementary, torsion-free hyperbolic\ngroup.\nTheorem 8. The elementary theory of a non-elementary, torsion-free hyperbolic\ngroup is not equational.\nProof: To modify the argument that was used in the free group case, we only\nneed to modify the proof of theorem 7. By the results of [Se4], the same sieve\nprocedure that was used for quantifier elimination over a free group can be used to\nobtain quantifier elimination over a general torsion-free, non-elementary hyperbolic\ngroup. By the results of [Se6], the sieve procedure and the description of definable\n11\n\n\fsets over a torsion-free hyperbolic group enable one to generalize the concept of\nan envelope of a definable set from a free group to a general torsion-free, nonelementary hyperbolic group.\nAs there exist quasi-isometric embeddings of a non-abelian free group into any\ngiven non-elementary torsion-free hyperbolic group, test sequences generalize to\ntorsion free hyperbolic groups (and indeed, test sequences in hyperbolic groups are\nused extensively in [Se4]). Therefore, to generalize the argument that was used to\nprove theorem 7 to non-elementary, torsion-free hyperbolic groups, the only result\nthat still needs to be generalized to hyperbolic groups is the Lyndon-Schutzenberger\ntheorem [Ly-Sch], that shows that for m, n, p \u2265 2, the solutions of the equation\nxm y n z p = 1 in a free group, generate a cyclic subgroup. For the purposes of\ngeneralizing the proof of theorem 7 we need a slightly weaker result that can be\nproved easily using Gromov-Hausdorff convergence.\nLemma 9. Let \u0393 be a non-elementary, torsion-free hyperbolic group. There exist\nsome positive integers l, b > 0, so that for every m > b, the solutions of the system\nxl+1 y \u2212l z m = 1 in \u0393, generate a cyclic subgroup in \u0393.\nProof: Let \u0393 be a non-elementary, torsion-free hyperbolic group for which such\npositive integers l and b do not exist. In that case there exist triples xn , yn , zn \u2208 \u0393,\nfor an increasing sequence of integers n, and for which:\n(1) xn+1\nyn\u2212n znm = 1 in \u0393.\nn\n(2) m > n, and xn , yn , zn do not belong to a cyclic subgroup in \u0393, hence, they\ndo not commute.\nThe sequence of values xn , yn , zn , define a sequence of homomorphisms from a free\ngroup F generated by < x, y, z, u, v, w >, to \u0393, hn : F \u2192 \u0393, hn (x) = xn , hn (y) = yn ,\nhn (z) = zn , hn (u) = xn+1\n, hn (v) = y \u2212n , hn (w) = znm . This sequence of actions\nn\nsubconverges into a non-trivial action (not necessarily faithful) of F on some real\ntree Y . xn+1\nyn\u2212n znm = 1 in \u0393, and this equation corresponds to a (thin) triangle\nn\nthat is associated with the equation: hn (u)hn (v)hn (w) = 1 in \u0393. In the limit tree\nY , this sequence of thin triangles converges in the Gromov-Hausdorff topology to a\n(possibly degenerated) tripod, and this tripod contains a (non-degenerate) segment\nthat is stabilized by at least two elements from the triple xn , yn , zn . By [Pa], this\nimplies that for large enough index n (from the convergent subsequence), two of\nthe elements xn , yn , zn commute, hence, these two elements are contained in the\nsame cyclic subgroup of \u0393. In a torsion-free hyperbolic group, this implies that for\nlarge enough n, all the 3 elements, xn , yn , zn , belong to the same cyclic subgroup\nof \u0393, a contradiction to (2).\n\u0003\nLemma 9 and the results of [Se4] and [Se6] allow one to generalize the proof of\ntheorem 7 to non-elementary, torsion-free hyperbolic groups, hence, to prove that\nsuch groups are not equational.\n\u0003\nReferences\n[Ba-Pi]\n\nA.
