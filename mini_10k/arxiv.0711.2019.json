Introduction\nA proper treatment of any matter-gravity system would require the quantisation\nof all degrees of freedom of matter and gravity. Attempts in this direction include\nString Theory [1] and Loop Quantum Gravity [2]. While awaiting for a universally\naccepted theory of quantum gravity, many useful results have been hitherto obtained\nby quantising the matter fields on a classical background [3]. The limit of this approach\ncan be na\u0131\u0308vely identified with the requirement that only energies (lengths) below\n(above) the Planck scale should be (explicitly) involved in the description of physical\nprocesses. There are however notorious exceptions to this rule, namely the occurrence\nof trans-Planckian frequencies in the Hawking effect [4] and in inflationary models [5],\nthe latter being the case we shall consider hereafter.\nAccording to the above remark, in a Friedman-Robertson-Walker Universe,\nphysical wavelengths of matter fields should be allowed only if a/k & lP (k being the\nwavenumber) or, equivalently, the cosmic scale factor a may be treated as a classical\nbackground quantity only when it is larger than multiples of the Planck length k lP\nfor the modes k of interest. Such a condition is easily violated during the inflationary\nevolution, since modes that are detected in the CMB spectrum today were transPlanckian at the beginning of inflation [5]. Nonetheless, the results obtained from\nquantum field theory are in very good agreement with observation.\nMany papers can be found in the literature which try to explain why such an\napproximate method works so well by showing that possible corrections to the CMB\nspectrum due to the unknown trans-Planckian physics should be small [6, 7, 8]. For\nexample, in Ref. [6], it was suggested that the trans-Planckian phase of the evolution\n\n\fHints of (trans-Planckian) asymptotic freedom in semiclassical cosmology\n\n2\n\nresults into suitable initial conditions for the quantum matter states at the time\nwhen the corresponding field modes become sub-Planckian and can afterwards be\nanalysed by the usual means. Several proposals for the initial conditions were also put\nforward based on the principle of minimum uncertainty [6] or otherwise [8]. There are\ntwo main critiques to this viewpoint: since different modes become sub-Planckian at\ndifferent times, one must assume that the background metric is already classical before\nany matter modes become sub-Planckian (tantamount to requiring that quantum\ngravitational fluctuations be small); moreover, any choice of initial conditions appears\narbitrary without a more explicit knowledge of the trans-Planckian theory. Although\nseveral approaches support the possibility that the Universe was indeed born in the\nsemiclassical regime (with a non-zero initial scale factor [9, 10, 11]), the issue of initial\nconditions for the matter states remains open.\nWe shall here investigate the dynamics of matter fields in cosmology near the limit\nof validity of the semiclassical approximation, that is for a \u223c k lP when the proper\nfrequency \u03c9 \u223c k/a of matter modes approaches the Planck scale. In order to perform\nour analysis, we shall employ the semiclassical approximation to the quantum WheelerDeWitt equation [12] in minisuperspace as proposed, for example, in Ref. [13] and later\ndeveloped in Refs. [14, 15, 16] (for a recent review of the Wheeler-DeWitt equation\nin cosmology, see Ref. [17]). In particular, our starting point will be a modified\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation for the quantum state of a mode of a minimally coupled scalar\nfield in the de Sitter Universe as obtained within this approach in Ref. [16]. This\nequation contains terms of order l2P which were treated as a perturbation at large\ntimes (i.e., for large scale factor a/k \u226b lP ), and the corresponding corrections to\nthe dispersion relation and CMB power spectrum estimated. We shall show in the\nnext Section that, in the opposite regime of very early times, quantum gravitational\nfluctuations become negligible and the scalar field is asymptotically free at higher and\nhigher energies. We shall also show that the initial state of each mode is very close\nto the usual vacuum and the coupling to gravitational perturbations always remains\nsmall. Of course, Planckian physics is expected to be non-perturbative due to the\nhighly non-linear nature of the Einstein-Hilbert action. Since the Wheeler-DeWitt\nequation cannot be solved exactly for the case at hand, we cannot give a rigourous\nmathematical proof that our results are totally safe. However, asymptotic safety in\nquantum gravity was conjectured almost thirty years ago [18] and seems to be further\nsupported now [19] in the effective action approach of quantum field theory. We thus\nbelieve that our results can be considered as also supporting this general idea from a\ntotally different perspective.\nWe shall use units with c = ~ = 1.\n2. Scalar field evolution at very early times\nIn Ref. [16], the evolution of one mode \u03c6 = \u03c6(k) of a scalar field minimally coupled\nto gravity was studied by means of the Born-Oppenheimer reduction of the WheelerdeWitt equation in the minisuperspace of a and \u03c6 [13]. We shall not repeat the\nderivation here, but just recall that using this procedure, one obtains the semiclassical\nEinstein-Hamilton-Jacobi equation for a = a(\u03c4 ) and a perturbed Schr\u00f6dinger equation\nfor | \u03c7i, the quantum state of \u03c6. Both equations contain terms proportional to l2P ,\nwhich can be viewed as representing quantum gravitational perturbations, but we\nshall primarily consider here their effects in the matter equation.\nThe case of interest to us is thus represented by the equation for | \u03c7i in the\n\n\fHints of (trans-Planckian) asymptotic freedom in semiclassical cosmology\n\n3\n\nde Sitter space-time,\na = a0 e H \u03c4 .\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere H is the Hubble constant. We shall also restrict our analysis to scalar field\nmodes with wavelength much shorter than the Hubble length,\na/k \u226a H\u22121 ,\n\n(2.2)\n\nso that the spatial curvature does not affect the scalar field dynamics and can be\nneglected. The relevant Schr\u00f6dinger equation can then be written as (see equation (18)\nin Ref. [16])\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0011\n3 i l2P \u0010\nl2P\n1\u2212\ni\n\u2202\n\u2212\n\u0124\n|\n\u03c7i\n=\n\u2206\u00d4| \u03c7i ,\n(2.3)\n\u03c4\n2 a3 H\n2 a3 H\nwhere\n\n1\n\u0124 =\n2\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03c0\u0302 2\n+ a k 2 \u03c6\u03022\na3\n\n\u0013\n\nis the \"unperturbed\" Hamiltonian for the quantum state of the mode k,\n1 2 2i\n\u2202 +\nh\u0124i \u2202\u03c4 + 3 i \u0124 ,\n\u00d4 =\nH \u03c4\nH\n\n(2.4)\n\n(2.5)\n\nand \u2206X\u0302 \u2261 X\u0302 \u2212 hX\u0302i for any operator X\u0302, with the scalar product between matter\nstates given by the Schr\u00f6dinger product at fixed a,\nZ\nh\u03c7|\u03bei = \u03c7\u2217 (\u03c6; a) \u03be(\u03c6; a) d\u03c6 .\n(2.6)\nAt zero order in lP , the above equation describes the usual quantum evolution in the\ncosmic time \u03c4 of a scalar field in the de Sitter space-time, including particle production\ninduced by the expanding background on the initial vacuum. Terms of order l2P\ntherefore represent (leading-order) effects of the quantum gravitational fluctuations\non the evolution of the scalar field. By contracting (2.3) with h\u03c7 |, we obtain\ni h\u2202\u03c4 i = h\u0124i .\n\n(2.7)\n\nNote that this equation alone does not imply that the solutions to equation (2.3) are\neigenstates of the Hamiltonian \u0124. In fact, (2.7) follows from h\u2206\u00d4i = 0 which means\nthat \u2206\u00d4 maps each state into orthogonal states.\nTo make contact with observation, it is possible to define an effective Hamiltonian\nwhich takes order l2P effects into account and consequently derive a modified dispersion\nrelation and the CMB power spectrum [16]. In Ref. [16], all of these quantities were\nobtained from (2.3) by investigating the late-time evolution of the system. This was\ntermed regime II in that paper, its precise definition being that the cosmic scale factor\nbe so large that a3 H \u226b l2P . It was also stated that, for earlier times such that a3 H \u226a\nl2P (regime I), the effect of gravitational fluctuations was expected to be negligible.\nTo support this assertion, it was shown that the ratio between the perturbations\nand the Hamiltonian vanishes in regime I. However, perturbative relations, strictly\nvalid only in regime II, were used in that argument, which might appear questionable,\nsince one na\u0131\u0308vely expects that the strength of quantum gravitational fluctuations grow\nindefinitely for increasing mode energy (i.e., going backward in time). It is therefore\nnecessary to further investigate the regime I.\n\n\fHints of (trans-Planckian) asymptotic freedom in semiclassical cosmology\n\n4\n\n2.1. Asymptotic states\nWe start from (2.3), which is valid in any regime and, for convenience, we rewrite as\n\u0010\n\u0011\ny\n\u2206\u00d4| \u03c7i ,\n(2.8)\ni \u2202\u03c4 \u2212 \u0124 | \u03c7i =\n1\u22123iy\nwhere\nl2P\ny\u2261\n,\n(2.9)\n2 a3 H\nand the very early regime I is then defined as y \u226b 1 (or \u2212\u03c4 \u226b H\u22121 ).\nIt is important to remark that the limit y \u226b 1 is compatible with the semiclassical\napproximation from which (2.3) follows. In fact, from a/lP \u223c k and y \u226b 1, one\nobtains the compatibility condition a H \u226a k \u22122 . Further, upon requiring that the\nmode k initially lies well inside the Hubble radius (that is, condition (2.2)), one finally\nobtains\n\u221a\n(2.10)\na H \u226a k \u226a 1/ a H ,\n\nwhich can be satisfied when a H \u226a 1, a condition which is obviously compatible\nwith the spatially flat de Sitter space-time (2.1) at very early times. On the other\nhand, if the geometry of the early Universe was exactly that of a spatially closed\nde Sitter [9], a H \u2265 1 and no mode k exists which satisfies (2.10). In this case, however,\ny . l2P H2 \u226a 1 and scalar field modes are generated in the perturbative regime II in\nwhich quantum gravitational fluctuations were already shown to be small [16].\nWe can now trade a = a(\u03c4 ) and, given (2.1), the time \u03c4 for y, so that\n\u2202\u03c4 = \u22123 H y \u2202y ,\n\n(2.11)\n\nand then expand all the quantities in equation (2.8) in powers of y.

Further, it is easily seen that they\ndo not solve equation (2.3) for finite values of y since, in this case, the potential\nin \u0124 is not negligible and the Hamiltonian changes (approximately) into that of\na harmonic oscillator (free scalar field) with time-dependent frequency (and mass)\nwhich admits (approximate) normalizable (discrete) eigenstates. Thus, as soon as\nthe potential is no more neglibile, the Hamiltonian spectrum changes and particle\nproduction begins (moreover, \u2206\u00d4| \u03c7i 6= 0, and transitions also occur among invariant\neigenstates \u2021). The only way one may accommodate for the asymptotic states (2.18)\nin the theory is therefore by considering normalised wave-packets as initial conditions\nfor the subsequent evolution of the scalar field states \u00a7.

Matter fluctuations in the gravitational equation\nThe asymptotic matter states we found are consistent solutions only if we can show\nthat their contribution to the evolution of the scale factor of the Universe is small\ncompared to the driving cosmological constant 3 H2 . This is not just tantamount to the\ncondition (2.34) above, but also requires that their quantum gravitational fluctuations\nin the Einstein-Hamilton-Jacobi equation for a = a(\u03c4 ) remain small [13].\nFrom Ref.

Intermediate regime\nThe results presented this far are quite interesting in themselves but do not yet fully\nvalidate the findings of Ref. [16]. In fact, from Ref. [16], we already know that the\neffects on matter states produced by gravitational fluctuations in regime II (y \u226a 1)\nare very small (of order l2P ), so we need to make sure that in between regimes I and\nII the fluctuations never become overwhelming with respect to the left hand side in\nequation (2.8).\nWe do not attempt at solving analytically equation (2.8) for arbitrary values of\ny, but we just note that there is no singularity in the strength of the fluctuations at\nthe transition between regimes I and II.

Therefore, the\ngravitational perturbations never become a dominant factor in the dynamics of the\nscalar field in de Sitter and the system reaches the regime II analyzed in Ref. [16] in\na state that does not differ significantly from (or even is just the same as) the one it\nwas in during regime I. This clearly supports the results presented in Ref. [16].\n+\n\nA more complete analysis of the coupled gravity-matter dynamics is being performed [21].\n\n\fHints of (trans-Planckian) asymptotic freedom in semiclassical cosmology\n\u03b3\n\n9\n\n0.30\n0.25\n0.20\n0.15\n0.10\n0.05\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\ny\n\nFigure 2.

Summary and conclusions\nWe have investigated the influence of quantum gravitational fluctuations on the\nevolution of a minimally coupled scalar field mode k in a spatially flat de Sitter\nbackground for values of the scale factor near the limit of validity of the semiclassical\napproximation, that is for a & k lP . We have found that, contrary to na\u0131\u0308ve intuition,\nthe effects of such fluctuations do not grow indefinitely with increasing energy (i.e.,\ngoing backward in time) but they actually vanish and the scalar field becomes\nasymptotically free in what we called regime I. This result is further supported by\nthe fact that quantum gravitational fluctuations have been shown to asymptotically\nvanish in the semiclassical equation that governs the evolution of the cosmic scale\nfactor [13, 15, 16]. It is important to remark that these conclusions only apply to\nthose wave-numbers k that satisfy the inequalities (2.10). Of course, this condition is\nnot really restrictive in the flat de Sitter space we have considered here, since a can be\nas small as possible. However, (on general quantum mechanical considerations [11])\none expects that the Universe was born into the semiclassical regime with a non-zero\ninitial scale factor and several approaches to quantum cosmology further support a\nspatially closed initial geometry (see, e.g., Refs. [9, 10]). The latter situation was\nactually taken into account in deriving equation (2.10), which ensures the scalar field\nmodes of relevance have a wavelength much shorter than the Hubble length and are\nnot affected by the spatial curvature at very early times.\nOf course, the possibility remains that a H & 1 initially, which would rule out\nall values of k with the asymptotic behaviour found in Section 2.1. This occurs, for\nexample, if the initial state of the Universe is exactly the closed de Sitter space-time of\nRef. [9]. For such large initial values of a, the regime I never happens and the Universe\nis actually born in regime II, in which quantum gravitational fluctuations are always\nvery small (of order H2 l2P ; see Ref. [16]). Since we have also shown that between the\nearly-time limit (if it exists) and the perturbative late-time phase, both the real and\nthe imaginary part of the coupling to gravitational fluctuations (2.40) always remain\nsmall, we can conclude that the gravitational perturbations never become a dominant\nfactor for the dynamics of the scalar field in a de Sitter Universe. This argument\nvalidates and supports the result of Ref. [16] where the effective dispersion relation\n\n\fHints of (trans-Planckian) asymptotic freedom in semiclassical cosmology\n\n10\n\nand CMB spectrum were computed.\nWe wish to conclude by adding that, even if regime I never occurred in our actual\nUniverse, the fact that a matter-gravity system admits the kind of asymptotic freedom\nwe have found can be of theoretical interest for our understanding of gravitation. In\nfact, although our approach is entirely different, we recalled in the Introduction that\na form of asymptotic freedom for pure gravity was conjectured in Ref. [18] and later\nsupported, e.g., in Refs. [19].\nAcknowledgments\nC.
