A key question is whether one can define the instantaneous ionization probability in the presence of an ionizing field. A\nclosely related question is to which extent the detachment of an electron by multiphoton absorption or quantum tunneling can be described by an ionization rate\n(see, for example, [3, 4]). Such a description is common, but it can be made rigorous only in stationary\nor quasi-stationary situations. Two such cases are the\nstatic and time-periodic external electric fields. In static\nfields, the system decays exponentially at a well-defined\nrate. In time-periodic fields, Floquet theory allows defining cycle-averaged decay rates (see e.g. [5] or [6] for a\nrecent application). In both situations, real and imaginary parts of complex energies give energy positions and\ndecay widths. Non-Hilbert space resonance states can\nbe associated with the complex energies, either by using complex scaling [7, 8] or by iteratively adapting the\nboundary conditions (Siegert boundary conditions) [6].\nNone of these approaches, however, provides a fully satisfactory framework for investigating the interaction of\nfew- to single-cycle ionizing pulses with matter. At the\nsame time, the establishment of attosecond absorption\nspectroscopy [9, 10] and the recent advances in the generation of optical waveforms [1, 11] call for a deeper understanding of dynamics unfolding within a laser cycle.\nSuch understanding implies the development of approximate analytical theories, and the aim of this article is to\nmake a step towards creating a useful theoretical framework.\nOur work is closely related to the development of adiabatic or quasistatic approximations to strong-field ionization, such as described in [12] and the papers cited\ntherein. In contrast to that research, we make no attempt\nto analytically describe strong-field ionization. Instead,\n\nwe search for an analytical description of resonant transitions that an attosecond pulse of ultraviolet (UV) or\nextreme-ultraviolet (XUV) radiation drives in the presence of a strong near-infrared field.\n\nDRESSED BOUND STATES\n\nLet us consider a quantum system (atom, ion, molecule\netc.) described by a Hamiltonian \u01240 . In the absence\nof any external field, this system has a set of orthonormal bound stationary states that satisfy the stationary\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation:\n\u01240 |ni = \u01eb(0)\nn |ni .\n\n(1)\n\nA typical attosecond measurement consists in letting the\nsystem interact with the electric fields of an intense laser\npulse EL (t), which may be regarded as a pump pulse,\nand a relatively weak probe pulse (or a train of pulses)\nEprobe (t). An XUV probe pulse may be as short as a few\ntens of attoseconds [13, 14]. Varying the delay between\nthe two pulses with an attosecond accuracy and observing the outcomes of their interaction with a quantum\nsystem provides valuable insights into phenomena triggered and steered by these two pulses [15]. If a significant\nfraction of atoms or molecules is ionized within a single\nhalf-cycle of the laser pulse, the interaction with the pulse\nis highly non-perturbative, so that an accurate description of this interaction calls for a numerical solution of\nthe time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation (TDSE). We\nassume that such a solution |\u03c8L (t)i is available, and one\nof our goals is to interpret strong-field dynamics in terms\nof some dressed states. These states, if introduced properly, may serve as a convenient starting point for building\napproximate models describing the interaction with the\nprobe pulse. Before we discuss different approaches to\ndefining such dressed states, let us list a few requirements\nthat they should fulfill.\nLet |\u03c6n (t)i be a bound dressed state associated with\na stationary state |ni. This means that |\u03c6n (t0 )i = |ni\nat some moment t0 before the interaction with external\nfields. As a first requirement, we demand that dressed\n\n\f2\nstates should form an orthonormal set of wave vectors at\nall times:\nh\u03c6m (t)|\u03c6n (t)i = \u03b4mn .\n\n(2)\n\nOrthonormality is not only convenient for computations,\nbut it is also needed for the physical interpretation of\nthe states: only for orthonormal states does finding a\nsystem in state |\u03c6n (t)i with probability |h\u03c6n (t)|\u03c8L (t)i| =\n1 imply that all other probabilities are 0.\nA strong laser field can significantly ionize a quantum system. As a free electron cannot absorb a photon,\nthe probe pulse predominantly interacts with bound electrons. Therefore, it would be desirable to have dressed\nstates that serve as a basis for describing the bound part\nof an electron wavefunction even in the presence of a\nstrong external electric field. When this property is satisfied, strong-field ionization should deplete bound dressed\nstates without changing their shape in a fashion similar\nto the decay of quasi-stationary states.\nExcept for losses due to ionization, each dressed state\nshould fully account for distortions caused by the laser\nfield. Therefore, we assume that the pump pulse induces\nno transitions between dressed states. This is the most\nimportant requirement\nD that we place on dressed\nE states,\nand it means that \u03c6m (t2 ) \u00dbL (t2 , t1 ) \u03c6n (t1 ) must be\n\nnegligibly small if m 6= n, where \u00dbL (t2 , t1 ) is the propagator describing the interaction with the laser pulse (the\nexact definition of the propagator is given below). In\nparticular, we expect that the interaction with the laser\npulse brings the quantum system from its initial state\n|ni to the corresponding dressed state |\u03c6n (t)i multiplied\nwith a probability amplitude an (t), the modulus of which\naccounts for the depletion by the laser pulse:\nD\nE\nan (t) = \u03c6n (t) \u00dbL (t, t0 ) n ,\n(3)\nwhile\n\nD\n\nE\n\u03c6m (t) \u00dbL (t, t0 ) n \u2248 0 if m 6= n.\n\n(4)\n\nAs long as the above assumptions hold, the effect of the\nlaser field on any dressed bound state can be expressed\nvia the probability amplitudes:\nD\n\nE a (t )\nn 2\n,\n\u03c6n (t2 ) \u00dbL (t2 , t1 ) \u03c6n (t1 ) \u2248\nan (t1 )\n\n(5)\n\nand the time evolution of the system can be approximated as\n\u00dbL (t2 , t1 ) \u2248\n\nX\nn\n\n|\u03c6n (t2 )i\n\nan (t2 )\nh\u03c6n (t1 )|.\nan (t1 )\n\n(6)\n\nNote that the approximate time evolution is no longer\nunitary as it accounts for ionization by losses from the\ndressed-state space.\n\nAssuming that time-dependent wave vectors |\u03c6n (t)i\nsatisfying all the above requirements exist, let us use\nthem to develop a general perturbative description of\nthe interaction of a laser-dressed system with a weak\nhigh-frequency probe pulse. For simplicity, we assume\nthat the pump (laser) and probe (UV or XUV) pulses\nare polarized along the z-axis. In the dipole approximation, the length-gauge Hamiltonian takes the form\n\u0124(t) = \u01240 + V\u0302L (t) + V\u0302probe (t) with\nV\u0302L (t) = eEL (t)\u1e90,\n\n(7)\n\nV\u0302probe (t) = eEprobe (t)\u1e90,\n\n(8)\n\nwhere e > 0 is the electron charge and \u1e90 is the dipole operator. The interaction with the laser pulse is described\nby\ni~\n\n\u0001\nd\n|\u03c8L (t)i = \u01240 (t) + V\u0302L (t) |\u03c8L (t)i\ndt\n\n(9)\n\nor, in the operator form,\ni~\n\n\u0001\n\u2202\n\u00dbL (t, t0 ) = \u01240 + V\u0302L (t) \u00dbL (t, t0 )\n\u2202t\n\n(10)\n\nwith |\u03c8L (t)i = \u00dbL (t, t0 ) |ii for an initial state |ii. A standard approach to developing a perturbation theory with\nrespect to the probe pulse consists in writing the complete TDSE\ni~\n\nd\n|\u03c8(t)i = \u0124(t) |\u03c8(t)i\ndt\n\n(11)\n\nin the following integral form:\n\u00db (t, t0 ) = \u00dbL (t, t0 ) \u2212\n\ni\n~\n\nZ\n\nt\n\ndt\u2032 \u00db (t, t\u2032 )V\u0302probe (t\u2032 )\u00dbL (t\u2032 , t0 ).\n\nt0\n\n(12)\nHere, \u00db (t, t0 ) is the propagator associated with the full\nHamiltonian \u0124(t):\ni~\n\n\u2202\n\u00db (t, t0 ) = \u0124(t)\u00db (t, t0 )\n\u2202t\n\n(13)\n\nand |\u03c8(t)i = \u00db (t, t0 ) |ii for the initial condition |\u03c8(t0 )i =\n|ii. Furthermore, if only single-photon processes play a\nrole in the interaction with the probe pulse, then the unknown operator \u00db (t, t\u2032 ) on the right-hand side of Eq. (12)\nmay be approximated with \u00dbL (t, t\u2032 ), which we consider\nto be known. This yields\n|\u03c8(t)i \u2248 |\u03c8L (t)i \u2212\n\ni\n~\n\nZ\n\nt\n\ndt\u2032 \u00dbL (t, t\u2032 )V\u0302probe (t\u2032 ) |\u03c8L (t\u2032 )i .\n\nt0\n\n(14)\nThe probe pulse may cause bound-bound, as well as\nbound-continuum transitions. In this paper, we focus\non transitions between bound states, leaving the direct\n\n\f3\nphotoionization by the probe pulse aside. In this case,\nEq. (14) can be written as\ni X\n|\u03c8(t)i \u2248 |\u03c8L (t)i \u2212\n~\nl,m\n\nZ\n\nt\n\ndt\n\nt0\n\n\u2032\n\n(\n\n\u00dbL (t, t\u2032 ) |\u03c6l (t\u2032 )i \u00d7\n\n)\nD\nE\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u03c6l (t ) V\u0302probe (t ) \u03c6m (t ) h\u03c6m (t )|\u03c8L (t )i . (15)\n\nLet us evaluate the probability amplitude that a system, initially prepared in state |\u03c8(t0 )i = |ii, will be found\nin state |\u03c6n6=i (t)i at a later time t. Multiplying both sides\nof Eq. (15) with h\u03c6n (t)| from the left, keeping in mind\nthe fact that |\u03c8L (t)i \u2248 ai (t) |\u03c6i (t)i, and using Eq. (5),\nwe obtain\nD\nE\n\u03b1ni (t) = \u03c6n (t) \u00db (t, t0 ) i = h\u03c6n (t)|\u03c8(t)i \u2248\nZ t\nai (t\u2032 )\ni\ndt\u2032 Eprobe (t\u2032 )\nZni (t\u2032 ) (16)\n\u2212 ean (t)\n~\nan (t\u2032 )\nt0\nfor n 6= i, where\nD\nE\nZni (t) = \u03c6n (t) \u1e90 \u03c6i (t)\n\n(17)\n\nis the transition matrix element between dressed states.\nEq. (16) is the desired expression, where the interaction\nwith the probe pulse is accounted for in first-order perturbation theory, while the effect of the strong laser pulse\nis represented by quantities related to dressed states.\nBased on Eq. (16), we can evaluate quantities observable\nin measurements. For example, the probability that, at\nsome final time tf after the interaction, the system will\nbe found in a bound stationary state |f i is given by\n2\n2\n\npf i = |hf |\u03c8(tf )i| =\n\nX\n\n\u03b1ni (tf ) hf |\u03c6n (tf )i .\n\n(18)\n\nn\n\nAs an example that is more relevant to transient absorption spectroscopy, the dipole response due to boundbound transitions induced by the probe pulse can be evaluated as\nD\nE X\nd(t) = \u03c8(t) \u1e90 \u03c8(t) \u2248\n\u03b1\u2217mi (t)Zmn (t)\u03b1ni (t). (19)\nm,n\n\nSo far, the dressed bound states were treated as an\nabstract mathematical concept. It is worth mentioning\nthat without the requirement that dressed states should\ndescribe bound electrons, the wavevectors |\u03c6n (t)i =\n\u00dbL (t, t0 ) |ni would exactly satisfy the rest of our requirements, but such dressed states would not serve their\nmain purpose, which is to facilitate the interpretation\nof bound electron dynamics in the presence of an intense\nlaser pulse. We do not know if perfect dressed states satisfying all our requirements including their bound character exist, but we can consider several approximations\n\nto dressed bound states and use our general theory to\ninvestigate their performance in comparison with exact\nsolutions of the TDSE. We will consider four different\ndefinitions of dressed bound states.\nAs a very crude approximation, one can attempt to use\nthe unperturbed stationary states:\nE\n(20)\n\u03c6(u)\nn (t) = |ni .\nAnother option, frequently encountered in literature, is\nto use time-dependent eigenstates of the Hamiltonian\n\u0124(t) evaluated in the subspace of unperturbed bound\nstates and normalized to satisfy Eq. (2):\nD\nE\nE\nX\n(a)\n(a)\n|mi m \u01240 + V\u0302L (t) \u03c6(a)\n(t)\n=\n\u01eb\n(t)\n\u03c6\n(t)\n.\nn\nn\nn\nm\n\n(21)\nIn the context of strong-field ionization, these states are\nknown under many different names, such as adiabatic\nstates [12, 16], quasistatic states [17, 18], phase-adiabatic\nstates [19], field-adapted states [20], and adiabatic fieldfollowing dressed states [21, 22]. We will refer to them\nas \"adiabatic states\".\nYet another reasonable approach is to obtain dressed\nbound states by solving the TDSE in the basis of unperturbed bound states:\nD\nE\nd (d) E X\n\u03c6n (t) =\n|ni n \u01240 + V\u0302L (t) \u03c6(d)\n(22)\ni~\nn (t)\ndt\nn\nE\n(d)\nwith the initial condition \u03c6n (t0 ) = |ni. With this\nchoice, we assume that virtual excitations into field-free\ncontinuum states do not influence\nthe dynamics. HowE\n(a)\never, contrary to \u03c6n (t) , these states do not follow\nthe laser field adiabatically, but rather allow for noninstantaneous response to the laser field. We will call\nthem \"dynamically dressed states\".\nThe above three alternatives allow one to evaluate the\ndressed bound states without solving the TDSE in the\nfull Hilbert space, although such solutions |\u03c8L (t)i are required later to obtain the probability amplitudes an (t)\nfrom Eq. (3). The last option that we are going to consider is different: we will evaluate dressed bound states\nby projecting solutions of the TDSE obtained in the\nwhole Hilbert space (9) onto the subspace of unperturbed\nbound stationary states and orthonormalizing them with\nthe aid of the Gram-Schmidt procedure:\nE Y\u0010\n\u0011X\nD\nE\n\u03c6\u0303n(p) (t) =\n1 \u2212 P\u0302l (t)\n|mi m \u00dbL (t, t0 ) n ,\nl<n\n\nm\n\n(23)\n\nE\nE\nE rD\n(p)\n(p)\n(p)\n\u03c6\u0303n (t)|\u03c6\u0303n (t) ,\n\u03c6(p)\n(t)\n=\n\u03c6\u0303\n(t)\n/\nn\nn\nwhere the projector P\u0302l (t) is defined as\nED\n(p)\n(p)\nP\u0302l (t) = \u03c6l (t) \u03c6l (t) .\n\n(24)\n\n(25)\n\n\f4\n0.05\n1\n\n0.98\n\n0.96\n\na)\n(u)\n\n2\n\n(a)\n\n2\n\n(d)\n\n2\n\n(p)\n\n2\n\na1 (t)\na1 (t)\na1 (t)\n\n0.94\n\na1 (t)\n\n0.04\n\n0.03\n\n0.02\n\n0.01\n\n0.92\n\n0.9\n\n|EL (t)| (atomic units)\n\nE\n(p)\nWe will call \u03c6n (t) \"projected dynamical states\", as\nthey result from calculations that account for\nall electron\nPSfrag\nreplacements\ndynamics including strong-field ionization, but the outcomes of these calculations are projected onto the fieldb)\nfree bound-state content.

The\nTDSE was solved on a grid with a step of \u2206z = 0.1\natomic units in a box as large as 819.2 atomic units. We\nused the first five bound states to investigate various definitions of dressed states. The most excited of these un(0)\nperturbed states has a binding energy of \u01eb4 = \u22120.077 =\n\u22122.10 eV.\nWe define the light pulses via their vector potentials:\nA(t) = \u2212Amax cos2 (t/T ) sin(\u03c9t) for |t| < \u03c0T /2 and\nA(t) = 0 for |t| \u2265 \u03c0T /2. Here, Amax = Emax /\u03c9 is the\npeak value reached by the envelope of the vector potential, Emax is the peak value reached by the envelope of\nthe electric field, \u03c9 is the central frequency, and T is\nrelated to the full width at half maximum\n(FWHM) \u0001\u0003\nof\n\u0002\nthe pulse intensity as T = FWHM/ 2 arccos 2\u22121/4 .\nGiven a vector potential A(t), the electric field is evaluated as F (t) = \u2212A\u2032 (t). In our simulations, we used a 3.5femtosecond laser pulse (TL = 126.78 = 3 fs) and a 300attosecond XUV probe pulse (Tprobe = 10.84 = 0.26 fs).\nThe central wavelength of the laser pulse was set to 760\nnanometers (\u03c9L = 0.06 = 2.48 fs\u22121 ). The central frequency of the XUV pulse was chosen to be resonant with\nthe transition between the first two stationary states:\n(0)\n(0)\n\u03c9probe = \u01eb1 \u2212 \u01eb0 = 1.34 = 36.38 eV. Although we\nmake no attempt to model a realistic atom, the excitation from |0i to |1i may be viewed as analogous to a\ndipole-allowed transition from an inner-shell orbital of a\nmulti-electron atom to an unoccupied orbital.\n\n0.04\n\n|EL (t)| (atomic units)\n\n1\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\nt (fs)\nFIG. 1.

In these simulations, we set n = 1,\nthat is, each simulation begins with the electron being in first excited state |1i. For the peak electric field\nEmax = 0.02 = 1010 V/m, the ionization probability is\nas little as 0.3%. If we knew the perfect dressed bound\nstates, then, for such a small ionization probability, our\nmodel system would largely remain in |\u03c61 (t)i, so that\n|a1 (t)|2 would only take values between |a1 (t0 )|2 = 1 and\n|a1 (tf )|2 = 0.997, decreasing more or less monotonously\nas the initial state is slightly depleted. Fig. 1 illustrates\nthe well-known fact that the unperturbed bound states\n(u)\nare very far from this ideal: |a1 (t)|2 reaches values below 0.95. This happens mainly because the initial state\nis distorted by the external field, which reduces the value\n(u)\nof | hn|\u03c8L (t)i |2 . So, even though |a1 (t)|2 can be interpreted as the probability of being in the unperturbed stationary state, it should not be given the physical meaning\nof being in some distorted but bound state that, after the\ninteraction, turns into the initial unperturbed stationary\n\n\f5\nstate.\n\n1\n\n(a)\n\neither. Even though \u03c61 (t)\n\naccounts for the distor(a)\n\np01 [EL ]/pTDSE\n[EL \u2261 0]\n01\n\nE\n(a)\nIn this respect, dressed state \u03c61 (t) , defined by\nPSfrag replacements\nEq.

However, unlike\n(u)\n(a)\n\u03c6n (t) and \u03c6n (t) , these dressed states do not nec-\n\nessarily turn into |ni once the laser pulse is gone. In\n(d,p)\nother words, |a1 (tf )|2 6= | h1|\u03c8L (tf )i |2 at a final time\ntf . As long as the discrepancy is small, it is legitimate to\ninterpret |a1 (t)|2 as the probability of being in the first\nexcited state dressed by the laser field. In these simula(p)\ntions, this discrepancy is much smaller for |a1 (t)|2 , as\n(d)\ncompared to |a1 (t)|2 , which is especially easy to see in\nFig. 1b.\nThe mere fact that, for a certain choice of dressed\nstates, |an (t)|2 does not show the intuitively expected\nstep-like behavior, does not necessarily mean that these\ndressed states should not be used in our analytical result\n(16) for the interaction with a probe pulse. In Fig. 2,\nwe plot the results of simulations where our model atom,\ninitially prepared in state |1i, interacts with the nearinfrared laser pulse EL (t) and a delayed attosecond XUV\npulse Eprobe (t \u2212 \u03c4probe ). We plot the probability to find\nthe atom in state |0i at the end of the simulation, normalized to the probability of the same transition in the\nabsence of the laser pulse. Applying our model, we found\nthat care should be taken implementing Eq. (18). If a\nhighly excited bound state is strongly depleted by the\nlaser pulse, an (t\u2032 ) in the denominator of Eq. (16) may\nbecome very small. As a result, even small inaccuracies\nin the approximations that we made deriving Eq. (16)\nmay result in big errors. To avoid this, we restrict the\n\n(u)\n\np01\n(a)\np01\n(d)\np01\n(p)\np01\npTDSE\n01\n\n0.95\n\nb)\n\ntion of the initial state in the external field, |a1 (t)|2\nin Fig. 1a still has pronounced minima at times where\n(a)\nEL (t) has its zero crossings, and |a1 (t)|2 reaches values\nthat are significantly smaller than the final probability\nof beingE in state |1i. The main reason for this is that\n(a)\n\u03c61 (t) is a stationary solution, while the average velocity of a bound electron can become relatively big in\nan intense laser pulse.

Also the small delays between the extrema of EL (t)\n(u)\nand the minima of |a1 (t)|2 , visible in Fig. 1a, point out\nsome non-adiabaticity of the electron response.\nThe intuitively expected step-like decrease of |a1 (t)|2 ,\nas the laser field depopulates the initial state, is best\nE\n(d)\nreproduced by the dynamically dressed states \u03c61 (t)\nE\n(p)\nand the projected dynamical states \u03c61 (t) , defined\n\na)\n\n0.9\n\n0.85\n\n0.8\n-4\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n\u03c4probe (fs)\n1\n0.9\n\nb)\n\n0.8\n\n(u)\n\np01\n(a)\np01\n(d)\np01\n(p)\np01\npTDSE\n01\n\n0.7\n0.6\n0.5\n0.4\n0.3\n0.2\n0.1\n0\n-4\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n\u03c4probe (fs)\nFIG. 2.

The effect of the laser field on the transition probability from state |0i to state |1i. For details, see the caption\nof Fig. 2 and the text.\n\nIn Fig. 3, we present similar calculations for a case\nmore relevant to possible experiments-in this case, the\nXUV pulse excites our model atom from its ground state.\nThe figure depicts the probability to find the atom in\nstate |1i after the interaction with the XUV and laser\npulses. EIn contrast to Fig. 2, the unperturbed states\n(u)\n\u03c61 (t) fail to describe the modulation of the transiE\n(a)\ntion probability by the laser field. Both \u03c61 (t) and\nE\n(p)\n\u03c61 (t) yield transition probabilities that agree with the\nTDSE calculations. The corresponding discrepancies are\ncomparable for\nE the more intense laser pulse (Fig. 3b), but\n(p)\nusing \u03c61 (t) clearly gives more accurate results if the\ndepletion of state |1i is weak (Fig. 3a). Thus,\nE in most\n(p)\ncases, the projected dynamical states \u03c6n (t) , defined\nby Eq. (24), best satisfy the requirements that we placed\non dressed bound states.\nHaving identified the most promising definition of\ndressed bound states, we can interpret the effect of the\nlaser pulse on the probabilities of XUV-induced transi-\n\ntions. The overall decrease of p01 with \u03c4probe in Fig. 2b,\nas well as the increase of p10 in Fig. 3b are clearly due\nto the depletion of the first excited state by the laser\nfield. The periodic modulations present in all the figures deserve more consideration. In principle, they may\nbe a consequence of two effects: the Stark shift, which\ndetunes the transition frequency away from the central\nfrequency of the XUV pulse, and the modulation of the\ndressed transition matrix element (17). In the present\nexample, we find that the dominant contribution is due\nto the effect of the laser field on the dressed matrix elements. To seeEthis, we plot |Z10 (t)|2 , evaluated with the\n(p)\n\naid of \u03c6n (t) , for different intensities of the laser field:\nFig. 4. For the central half-cycles of the laser pulse, the\nmodulation depths of |Z10 (t)|2 are very close to those of\ntransition probabilities in Figs. 2 and 3. A strong field\ntends to reduce |Z10 (t)|2 because it displaces the electron\nwavefunction in the first excited state, while the ground\nstate in the present example has a very small polarizability. As a consequence, the overlap between the two\ndressed states decreases, which results in a smaller value\nof the dipole transition matrix element between them.\nThe relatively fast oscillations of |Z10 (t)|2 at the tail\nof the laser pulse are mainly due to the multiphoton excitation of state |3i from state |1i. The energy difference\n(0)\n(0)\nbetween these two states is \u01eb3 \u2212 \u01eb1 = \u22120.113 + 0.408 \u2248\n0.29 atomic units; since the transitions from both these\nstates to |0i are dipole-allowed, this leads to quantum\nbeats with a period of 2\u03c0/0.29 = 21 at. u. = 0.5 fs.\nThese quantum beats do not, however, appear in the\nprobabilities of the XUV-induced transitions presented\nin Figs. 2 and 3 because the XUV pulse, which is resonant with the transition between states |0i and |1i, does\nnot have enough bandwidth to drive transitions between\nstates |0i and |3i. This fact is successfully accounted for\nby our analytical theory.\n\n\f7\nCONCLUSIONS AND OUTLOOK\n\nWe have theoretically investigated how an ionizing\nfew-cycle near-infrared laser pulse affects single-photon\nbound-bound transitions driven by an attosecond pulse\nof extreme ultraviolet radiation. Our approach is based\non the assumption that even when the laser field is strong\nenough to significantly ionize a quantum system, one can\ndescribe bound electrons with some dressed bound states,\nwhich we introduce in an abstract way by a set of simple\nrequirements listed at the beginning of section . With\nsuch dressed states, we have obtained relatively simple\nanalytical results for the perturbative interaction with a\nprobe pulse, such as Eq. (16). For a particular model\nproblem, we have systematically compared four different\nkinds of dressed bound states and found that the most\naccurate results are generally obtained with the projected\ndynamical states (24). These states are easily evaluated\nfrom numerical simulations of the interaction with the\nlaser pulse, and they make no assumptions about the\nadiabaticity of the response to the laser pulse.\nAs the main observable in our numerical examples, we\nhave chosen the probability to find a single-electron atom\nin a certain state after the interaction with light pulses.\nThis was done to test our analytical theory in a possibly\nsimple and convincing way. Experimentally, it is easier to\nmeasure the transient absorption of an attosecond pulse\nin the presence of an ionizing laser field [10]. It should\nbe straightforward to employ dressed bound states to\ntheoretically investigate attosecond transient absorption\nmeasurements. In this paper, we have only made a first\nstep in this direction by writing an explicit expression\nfor the dipole response associated with an XUV-driven\nlaser-dressed bound-bound transition: Eq. (19).\nThe main purpose of this work has been to define general properties for dressed states in strong laser-atom interactions and to explore their existence. We have shown\nthat quantum states with properties close to those of idealized dressed bound states can be found. From the fact\nthat, overall, the projected dynamical states \u03c6(p) perform\nbest, while all other states show severe shortcomings in\nvarious situations, we can draw the following preliminary\nconclusions: Not surprisingly, beyond the lowest intensities, the unperturbed states \u03c6(u) are not suitable for the\nanalysis of laser induced dynamics. Adiabatic states \u03c6(a)\nprovide a good qualitative picture, but they fail when the\nvelocity acquired by a bound electron in a strong field\nbecomes significant, which is the case for systems with a\nreasonable polarizability. The dynamically dressed states\n\u03c6(d) showed us that admitting dynamics, but restricting\nit to the field-free bound states, may worsen rather than\nimprove the agreement with the full TDSE: it appears\nthat the restriction of the dynamics actually introduces\nserious artifacts, even when comparing to the simpler\nadiabatic states computed in the same subspace of field-\n\nfree bound states. Finally, from the projected dynamical\nstates \u03c6(p) we learn that the field-free continuous part of\nthe spectrum influences the dynamics, but does not play\na crucial role for the computation of transition matrix\nelements between bound states. These four examples are\nclearly not the only possible choices. For example, rather\nthan restricting to a few field-free bound states, one may\nuse adiabatic or dynamic states confined to a box, which\nwould admit virtual continuum states without the need\nfor a full solution of the TDSE, as in the projected dynamical states.\nWe have thus shown that also in situations where significant and strongly time-dependent ionization occurs,\ndressed bound states allow for a simple analysis of experimentally observable dynamics and carry our picture\nof state-depletion and perturbative transitions between\nthe dressed states into extreme time scales and intensity\nregimes. This finding is conceptually important. Pragmatic considerations how to further improve the dressed\nstates and possibly find a compromise between accuracy\nand computational simplicity are left to future work.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThe authors acknowledge illuminating discussions with\nJ.
