Interest in such quasiparticles is due\nto the possibility of non-Abelian statistics which they satisfy [9]. The most accessible case are Majorana Bound\nStates (MBS) at the 1-dimensional edge of a quantum\nspin Hall insulator [10, 11]. Two Majorana fermions can\nform a usual Dirac fermion. However, to detect a state of\nMajorana fermion which has no definite charge, requires\nnon-local measurements. It was suggested [12, 13] that a\ntunneling probe can detect the presence of MBS. While\nthe tunneling probe is a local measurement it can detect\ninterference effects between various MBS. Recently an array of alternating ferromagnetic and superconducting regions at the QSH edge were considered [15, 16]. This array may appear due to local density fluctuations at a random FM/SC boundaries that host MBS. The tunneling\ncharacteristics (conductance and tunneling current) were\ncalculated for a network of coupled Majorana fermions.\nBoth isolated [16] and random chains [15] cases were analyzed. Here we show how Majorana fermions can be\ndetected by shot noise measurements. For this we calculate the noise power for different networks of MBS and\npresent a general formulation of this problem based on\nKeldysh technique.\nThe Hamiltonian: We consider the tunneling between\nthe normal metal lead and a realization of 1d Majorana\nchain [11, 14\u201316]. The coupled Majorana state network\nis described by the Hamiltonian\niX\nHM =\ntij \u03b3i \u03b3j\n(1)\n2 i,j\nwhere \u03b3i are operators for the i-th Majorana fermion,\nsatisfying \u03b3i = \u03b3i\u2020 , \u03b3i2 = 1, and tij are elements of\nan antisymmetric matrix t\u0302 for the coupling between the\ni, j MBS. Disorder may be introduced as random nearest neighbor coupling. The \u03b3i can be written as a Bogolyubov transformation for the quasiparticles in the superconductor composed of creation \u03a8\u2020\u03c3 (x) and annihila-\n\ntion \u03a8\u03c3 (x) operators of electrons at position x and spin\n\u03c3. The coefficients f\u03c3,i (x) in this transformation are the\neigenvalues of the Bogoloyubov de Gennes Hamiltonian\nwith zero energy. The general form is\nZ\n\u2217\n\u03b3i = \u03a3\u03c3 dx(f\u03c3,i (x)\u03a8\u03c3 (x) + f\u03c3,i\n(x)\u03a8\u2020\u03c3 (x))\n(2)\nThe tunneling between the normal metal electrode\nP R and the \u2020 superconductor is given by HT =\ndx[tk (x)ck\u03c3 \u03a8\u03c3 (x) + h.c.]. Below we consider the\nk\u03c3\nenergy gap \u2206 of superconductor as the biggest energy\nscale in the problem. Then for small applied voltage\neV < \u2206 only zero-energy Majorana operator projection\nof total quasiparticle operator in superconductor is important [15\u201317]. Thus the tunneling Hamiltonian and the\ncurrent operator in Nambu space become\n1X\n(3)\nc\u0304(0)\u03c4z V\u0302i \u03b3i + h.c\nHT =\n2 i\nie X\nI =\nc\u0304(0)V\u0302i \u03b3i + h.c \u2261 ieJ\n(4)\n2 i\nwhere c(0) = (c\u2191 , c\u2193 , c\u2020\u2193 , \u2212c\u2020\u2191 )T corresponds to the normal\nlead electron operator at x = 0 The coupling between\nthe normal lead and Majorana states is given by a vec\u2217\n\u2217 T\ntor in Nambu space V\u0302i = (f \u0304\u2191,i , f \u0304\u2193,i , f \u0304\u2193,i\n, \u2212f \u0304\u2191,i\n) where\nR\n \u0304\nf\u03c3,i = dxf\u03c3,i (x)tk (x) describe the interaction of MBS\nwith the lead electrons and we assumed a weak momentum dependence of matrix element tk for tunneling to\nthe lead. The Pauli \u03c4 -matrices act on (c\u03c3 ; f \u0304\u03c3,i ) and (c\u2020\u03c3 ;\n\u2217\nf \u0304\u2193,i\n) blocks. Total hamiltonian in addition to parts (1,3)\nincludes the lead contribution which we take at voltage\nbias V . We write below the action for lead in the rotated\nKeldysh basis\nZ\n(5)\nSlead =\ndt\u03a3k  \u0304\u0109k gk\u22121 \u0109k\nwhere gk\u22121 is the inverse Green function for electrons\nin the lead. For further use we introduce the Green's\n\n\f2\nfunction (GF) of the lead integrated on momentum \u1e21 =\n1\n2\u03c0 \u03a3k gk that has the following Keldysh form\n\u0012 R K\u0013\n\u1e21 \u1e21\n\u1e21 =\n(6)\n0 \u1e21 A\nHere all entries are 4 \u00d7 4 diagonal matrix in Nambu\nspace. In energy representation each of them has\na form: \u1e21 R,A = \u2213 2i N (0) diag(1,1,1,1) and i\u1e21 K =\n\u03c9+eV\nN(0)diag[tanh \u03c9\u2212eV\n2T (1, 1, 0, 0) + tanh 2T (0, 0, 1, 1)],\nwhere N(0) is the electron density of states in the normal\nmetal lead. To calculate the noise we need to find the\neffective action as function of a quantum source. We\ncombined the current operator (J) multiplied by source\nfields \u03bb\u0302=diag(\u03bb1 , \u2212\u03bb2 ) on standard 1, 2 Keldysh contour.\nWe obtain a combined source-tunneling contribution to\nthe action\nZ\nX\n1\nSs = \u2212\n[c\u0304(0)(\u03c4z \u03c3z + I\u02c6\u03bb\u0302)V\u0302i \u03b3i\ndt\n2\ni\n+\u03b3i V\u0302i\u2020 (\u03c4z \u03c3z \u2212 I\u02c6\u03bb\u0302)c(0)]\n\n(7)\n\nHere the Pauli matrix \u03c3z relates quantum operators (Majorana \u03b3i = (\u03b3i1 , \u03b3i2 ) and lead fermions) on the two time\ncontours (1, 2). I\u02c6 is the unit matrix in the Keldysh or\nNambu spaces. Integrating out the lead electron operators and performing a rotation to the Keldysh form similar to (6) we arrive to a simple representation of Ss .\nKeeping only the quantum source \u03bbq = (\u03bb1 \u2212 \u03bb2 )/2 we\nobtain\nZ\nX \u2032 \u2020\n[\u03b3i V\u0302i (\u03c4z \u03c3x \u2212\nSs = \u2212\u03c0 dt\ni,j\n\n\u02c6 x \u03bbq )V\u0302j \u03b3j\u2032 ]\n\u02c6 q )\u1e21(\u03c4z I\u02c6 + I\u03c3\nI\u02c6I\u03bb\n\n(8)\n\nWhere \u03b3i = (\u03b3icl , \u03b3iq )T = (\u03b31i + \u03b32i , \u03b31i \u2212 \u03b32i )T /2.

With two\ncoupled Majorana's the shot noise shows clear steps in\nits voltage dependence. They corresponds to the peaks in\nconductance at eV = \u00b12t. Therefore the measurement of\nthe noise can detect Majorana fermions. In case that one\nof the links is weak: tlink < t the noise loses its structure\n( lower right panel in Fig.1) and becomes similar to the\ncase of a single Majorana (upper left panel in Fig. 1).\nIn this case the sharp drop of conductance at voltage\neV \u2192 0 can be smeared by a small temperature.\nThe Fano factor is defined as the ratio F = Sshot /2eI.\nFor the NS junction F (V \u2192 0) = 2 reflecting the transmission of cooper pairs through the superconductor. The\nFano factor corresponding to the upper right panel of Fig.\n1 (2 MBS) is plotted in Fig. 2. The zero bias value of\nFano factor F (V = 0) = 2 does not depend on the on the\nvalue of t 6= 0 and is the same integer for four MBS, the\ncase in the lower left panel of Fig. 1. However, when the\nsecond Majorana state interacts with the normal lead,\ni.e. \u039322 6= 0, F (V = 0) is non-integer and decreasing, as\nshown by the solid line in Fig. 2. In contrast, with odd\nnumber of MBS F (V \u2192 0) = 0.\nConsidering next the case of an infinite homogeneous\nchain, where all near neighbor couplings are identical\nti,i+1 = t, the Green's functions can be easily found\n[16]. The calculations of the shot noise are performed\nfor t/\u0393 = 0.1 and compared with conductance in Fig. 3.\nDisordered case \u2013 isolated Majorana pairs: We consider\nnext the case of a semi infinite MBS chain with a random ti,i+1 and only the 1st MBS is coupled to the lead\n\u0393ii \u223c \u03b4i,1 . This system can be mapped to a system of\nindependent MBS pairs [15] by using analysis methods of\nthe quantum Ising spin chain [19, 20].
