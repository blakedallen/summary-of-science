For recent reviews on dark energy,\nplease see [3\u20139]. As is known above 90% of the energy\ncontent in Universe is made of unknown dark component.\nHowever, the nature of this dark fluid is still unknown.\nUsually, this dark fluid is divided into two parts: dark\nmatter and dark energy. But as pointed out by the authors [10, 11], there exists another possibility that it is\na mixture of dark matter and dark energy, or just one\nexotic unknown fluid. This property is dubbed as dark\ndegeneracy. A unified dark fluid is defined from the Einstein field equation\ndark\nT\u03bc\u03bd\n=\n\n1\nobs\nG\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 T\u03bc\u03bd\n,\n8\u03c0G\n\n(1)\n\nobs\nwhere T\u03bc\u03bd\nis the observed energy components and G\u03bc\u03bd\nis the observed geometric structure of Universe. In the\nframework of linear perturbation theory, the micro scale\nproperties of a fluid are characterized by its equation of\nstate (EoS) wd and sound speed c2s . As a contrast to the\nreports where a parametrized form of EoS of dark energy\nis assumed in the so-called model-independent formalism, we study a unified dark fluid with constant adiabatic\nsound speed c2s = \u03b1. Actually, the case of zero adiabatic\nsound speed has been studied in Ref. [11, 12]. And time\nvariable sound speed cases were also discussed in [13]. In\n\n\u2217\n\u2020\n\u2021\n\nlxxu@dlut.edu.cn\nyuting.wang@port.ac.uk\nhr@kasi.re.kr\n\nthis paper, we consider a generalized case, i.e c2s = \u03b1.\nThe similar situation was also discussed in [14] where an\neffective cosmological constant \u03c1\u039b and dark matter were\ndefined. And it was dubbed as \u039b\u03b1CDM model. In fact,\nfor a unified dark fluid, one can do different decomposition, for example defining dark matter \u03c1dm \u2261 \u03c1dm0 a\u22123\nand the remaining part as dark energy \u03c1de \u2261 \u03c1d \u2212 \u03c1dm .\nHowever, without the guide of physics principle, any decomposition would be non-proper. Moreover, it may be\njust an entirely whole energy component. And there does\nnot exist any decomposition at all. So as a contrast to\nRef. [14] , in this paper, we prefer taking it as an entirely\nwhole dark fluid and show the properties of dark degeneracy. Furthermore instead of using the location of CMB\nacoustic peaks as done in [14], the full information from\nWMAP 7-year data sets will be used in this paper. As a\nresult, a tighter constraint will be obtained.\n\nAt first, in section II, the energy density and background evolution equation for a unified dark fluid of constant adiabatic sound speed are shown. The corresponding scalar fields action is also presented. In section III, by\nusing Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method with\ncurrently available cosmic observational data sets which\ninclude type Ia supernova Union 2, baryon acoustic oscillation and WMAP 7-year CMB, we show the parameter\nspace. A summary is presented in section IV.\n\n\f2\nwhere B is another integration constant. After the normalization of scale factor a to 1 today, a0 = 1, one has\ndark fluid energy density in the form\no\nn\n(8)\n\u03c1d = \u03c1d0 (1 \u2212 Bs ) + Bs a\u22123(1+\u03b1) ,\n\nII. GENERALIZED DARK DEGENERACY\nFLUID WITH A CONSTANT ADIABATIC\nSOUND SPEED\nA.\n\nBackground Equations, Perturbations and\nInstabilities\n\nConsider a unified dark fluid as a barotropic fluid with\nconstant adiabatic sound speed\nc2s = \u03b1.\n\n(2)\n\nFor barotropic fluid the adiabatic sound speed equals the\nspeed of which perturbations propagate in the fluid. Generally its EoS is given as\nP (\u03c1) = w(\u03c1)\u03c1,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere w(\u03c1) is the EoS of this unified dark fluid. From\nthe definition of adiabatic sound speed\nc2s\n\n=\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2202P\n\u2202\u03c1\n\n\u0013\n\n=\n\ns\n\ndP\ndw\n=\u03c1\n+ w = \u03b1,\nd\u03c1\nd\u03c1\n\n(4)\n\nafter integration, one obtains its solution\nw =\u03b1\u2212\n\nA\n,\n\u03c1\n\n(5)\n\nwhere A is the integration constant. The pressure P =\n\u03b1\u03c1 \u2212 A can be obtained immediately. Assuming only\ngravitational interaction between energy components and\nconsidering the conservation of energy of dark fluid\n\u03c1\u0307d + 3H(1 + wd )\u03c1d = 0,\n\n(6)\n\none has the energy density of dark fluid\n\u03c1d =\n\nA\n+ Ba\u22123(1+\u03b1) ,\n1+\u03b1\n\nConsider a spatially flat FRW universe\n\u0002\n\u0003\nds2 = \u2212dt2 + a2 (t) dr2 + r2 (d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 ) ,\n\n(7)\n\n(10)\n\nwhere Bs = B/\u03c1d0 . In terms of Bs and \u03c1d0 , one has\nA = \u03c1d0 (1 + \u03b1)(1 \u2212 Bs ). For this unified dark fluid, one\ncan do a decomposition, for example, \u03c1dm = \u03c1dm0 a\u22123\nwith usual power law and \u03c1de = \u03c1d \u2212 \u03c1dm . If you like,\nyou can do many kinds of decomposition. But, without\nany guide of physics principle, any kind of decomposition\nis non-proper. It has the possibility that it is just a whole\ncomponent. And there does not exist any decomposition\nat all. So, in this paper, we will keep it as a whole unified dark fluid and do not implement decomposition any\nmore. Then one can recast EoS of dark fluid wd into\n(1 + \u03b1)(1 \u2212 Bs )\n.\n(9)\n(1 \u2212 Bs ) + Bs a\u22123(1+\u03b1)\nin terms of Bs and \u03b1 which are model parameters in our\nstory. It is interesting that the adiabatic sound speed \u03b1\nappears in the power law index of scale factor. It can\nbe understood easily as follows. Since c2s = \u03b1 has relation with perturbation propagates in fluid, it modifies\nthe scaling relation of energy density with scale factor\nnaturally. Staring at the expression of energy density of\nthis dark fluid, one sees that a cosmological constant is\nrecovered when Bs = 0 and dark matter is obtained if\nBs = 1 and \u03b1 = 0 are respected. To protect energy density from negativity, 0 \u2264 Bs \u2264 1 is mandatory. In some\nsense, one can take this unified dark fluid energy density\nas a interpolation from 'dark matter' and cosmological\nconstant. Just in this sense, it was dubbed as \u039b\u03b1CDM\nmodel by authors [14]. Then one can find out that the\nEoS of this dark fluid is in the range of wd \u2208 [\u22121, \u03b1).\nWe can show the evolutions of wd (a) with respect to the\nscale factor a in Figure 1, where different values of model\nparameters \u03b1 and Bs are taken. From the left panel of\nFigure 1, one sees that this dark fluid is dark matter like\nin the early epoch when \u03b1 approaches to zero in the limit\na \u2192 0.\nwd = \u03b1 \u2212\n\nfrom the Einstein field equations, one has the Friedmann\nequation\n\nn\nh\ni\no\nH 2 = H02 (1 \u2212 \u03a9b \u2212 \u03a9r ) (1 \u2212 Bs ) + Bs a\u22123(1+\u03b1) + \u03a9b a\u22123 + \u03a9r a\u22124 ,\n\nwhere H is the Hubble parameter with its current value\nH0 = 100hkm s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 , and \u03a9i (i = b, r) are dimen-\n\n(11)\n\nsionless energy parameters of baryon, radiation density\n\n\f3\n0.0\n\n0.0\n\n-0.2\n\nwd HaL\n\nwd HaL\n\n-0.2\n\n-0.4\n\n-0.4\n\n-0.6\n\n-0.6\n\n-0.8\n\n-0.8\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\na\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\na\n\nFIG. 1.

For\nthe gauge ready formalism about the perturbation theory, please see [16]. For the dark fluid in this paper, we\nassume the shear perturbation \u03c3d = 0. In our calculations, the adiabatic initial conditions will be taken.\nThe linear and nonlinear instabilities were studied extensively in the context of unified dark fluid model [17].\nFor the linear perturbations, the adiabatic sound speed\nof the unified dark fluid c2s = \u03b1 is kept in the range of\n0 to 1 in our model, so the linear instability is avoided.\nThe averaging problem is involved when perturbations\nbecome nonlinear. The problem coms from the fact that\nhpi 6= p(h\u03c1i) for unified dark fluid models. For example,\nin the generalized Chaplygin gas (GCG) model [18]\nA\np=\u2212 \u03b2\n\u03c1\n\nScalar Fields\n\nIn [17], the authors discussed the relations of GCG\nwith scalar fields. Then what about the unified dark\nfluid with a constant adiabatic sound speed? In this subsection, we will derive its Lagrangian density following\nthe procedure of [17]. For a single scalar field, the action\nis generalized to the form [17, 19]\nZ\n\u221a\nS\u03c6 = d4 x \u2212gL(X, \u03c6),\n(16)\nwhere L is the Lagrangian density, \u03c6 is a real scalar field,\nand X is its kinetic term X = \u2212\u2207\u03bc \u2207\u03bc \u03c6/2. Then the\nenergy density and pressure are given as\n\u03c1 = 2Xp,X \u2212 p,\n\np = L(X, \u03c6).\n\n(14)\n\n(15)\n\nin the case of \u03b2 6= 0. However, it is not the issue in\nour model for the linear relations between p and \u03c1, i.e.\np = \u03b1\u03c1\u2212A. It is a feature of our unified dark fluid model.\n\n(17)\n\nTo get the Lagrangian density is to solve the first differential equation of Eq. (17) in terms of X. For our unified\ndark fluid model, one has\n2\u03b1Xp,X \u2212 (1 + \u03b1)p \u2212 A = 0.\n\n(18)\n\nFor \u03b1 = 0, the solution is p(X) = \u2212A. For \u03b1 6= 0, one\nhas the solution\np = \u03b1X (1+\u03b1)/(2\u03b1) \u2212 A/(1 + \u03b1).\n\n(19)\n\nIn terms of X, the energy density is given as\n\u03c1 = A/(1 + \u03b1) + X (1+\u03b1)/(2\u03b1) .\n\nwhere A and \u03b2 are positive model parameters in GCG\nmodel, one can check that\nhpi = \u2212hA/\u03c1\u03b2 i =\n6 \u2212A/h\u03c1i\u03b2 = p(h\u03c1i),\n\nB.\n\n(20)\n\nThus the Lagrangian density is\nL(X) = p(X) = \u03b1X (1+\u03b1)/(2\u03b1) \u2212 A/(1 + \u03b1)\n\n(21)\n\nwith 0 < X < 1/2.

In Figure 2,\nwe illustrate how the CMB temperature anisotropies are\ncharacterized by different values of \u03b1, by choosing different values of Bs with the other cosmological parameters\nfixed.\n\n6000\n\n6000\n\u03b1=0, Bs=0.35\n\nBs=0.35, \u03b1=0.0001\n\n\u03b1=0, B =0.40\n\nB =0.35, \u03b1=0.001\n\ns\n\n5000\n\ns\n\n\u03b1=0, Bs=0.45\n\n5000\n\n3000\n\nTT\n\nTT\nl\n\n2\n\nl(l+1)Cl /(2\u03c0)[\u03bcK ]\n\n4000\n\n2\n\nl(l+1)C /(2\u03c0)[\u03bcK ]\n\n4000\n\nBs=0.35, \u03b1=0.01\n\n3000\n\n2000\n\n2000\n\n1000\n\n1000\n\n0\n0\n10\n\n1\n\n2\n\n10\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\n0\n0\n10\n\n1\n\n2\n\n10\n\nl\n\n10\n\n3\n\n10\n\nl\n\nFIG. 2. The effects on CMB temperature power spectra of a unified dark fluid with constant adiabatic sound speed c2s = \u03b1\ncharacterized by different values of \u03b1 and Bs . On the left panel, the fixed value of \u03b1 = 0 is adopted. The bottom red solid\nline is with Bs = 0.45 and top green dotted line is with Bs = 0.35, and the center one is with Bs = 0.40. On the right panel,\nBs = 0.35 is fixed. The lines take the values of \u03b1 = 0.0001, 0.001, 0.01 from bottom to the top.\n\nFrom the left panel of Figure 2, as is expected Bs corresponds to an effective dimensionless energy density of\ndark matter at early epoch. So, increasing the values of\nBs will make the equality of matter and radiation earlier,\nthen the sound horizon is decreased. As a result, the first\npeak is depressed. The variation of the second peak is\nfrom the variation of ratio of baryon and effective dark\nmatter. The right panel of Figure 2 shows the effects\nof \u03b1 on the CMB power spectra. As shown in Eq. (8),\nthe values of \u03b1 describe the possible deviation from standard evolution scaling law a\u22123 of effective dark matter.\nIt affects the CMB power spectra at large scales l < 100\nvia Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect due to the evolution of gravitational potential. At small scales, the effect\ncomes from the different scaling of effective dark matter evolution. From the Figure 2, one can read that the\nCMB power spectra are sensitive to the values of \u03b1 and\nBs . Then the full CMB information will be helpful to\nconstrain the model parameter space.\n\nB.\n\nMethod and data points\n\nTo obtain the parameter space, the observational constraints are performed by using Markov Chain Monte\n\nCarlo (MCMC) method. We modified publicly available\ncosmoMC package [21] to include the dark fluid perturbation in the CAMB [22] code which is used to calculate\nthe theoretical CMB power spectrum. The following 7dimensional parameter space is adopted\nP \u2261 {\u03c9b , \u0398S , \u03c4, \u03b1, Bs , ns , log[1010 As ]}\n\n(23)\n\n2\n\nwhere \u03c9b = \u03a9b h is the physical baryon density, \u0398S\n(multiplied by 100) is the ration of the sound horizon\nand angular diameter distance, \u03c4 is the optical depth, \u03b1\nand Bs are two newly added model parameters related\nto dark fluid, ns is scalar spectral index, As is the amplitude of of the initial power spectrum. The pivot scale\nof the initial scalar power spectrum ks0 = 0.05Mpc\u22121 is\nused in this paper. The following priors to model parameters are adopted: \u03c9b \u2208 [0.005, 0.1], \u0398S \u2208 [0.5, 10],\n\u03c4 \u2208 [0.01, 0.8], \u03b1 \u2208 [0, 1], Bs \u2208 [0, 1], ns \u2208 [0.5, 1.5],\nlog[1010 As ] \u2208 [2.7, 4]. Furthermore, the hard coded prior\non the comic age 10Gyr < t0 < 20Gyr is also imposed.\nAlso, the physical baryon density \u03c9b = 0.022 \u00b1 0.002 [23]\nfrom big bang nucleosynthesis and new Hubble constant\nH0 = 74.2 \u00b1 3.6kms\u22121 Mpc\u22121 [24] are adopted.\nTo get the distribution of parameters, we calculate the\n2\ntotal likelihood L \u221d e\u2212\u03c7 /2 , where \u03c72 is given as\n\u03c72 = \u03c72CMB + \u03c72BAO + \u03c72SN .\n\n(24)\n\n\f5\nThe 557 Union2 data [28] with systematic errors and\nBAO [25] are used to constrain the background evolution, for the detailed description please see Refs. [29].\nSN Ia is used as standard candle. And BAO is used\nas standard ruler. At the last scattering of CMB radiation, the acoustic oscillation in the baryon-photon fluid\nwas frozen and imprinted their signature on the matter\ndistribution. The characterized scale of BAO in the observed galaxy power spectrum is determined by the comoving sound horizon at drag epoch zd which is shortly\nafter photon decoupling. To calculate rs (zd ), one needs\nto know the redshift zd at decoupling epoch and its corresponding sound horizon. In our story, the usual fitting\nformula [26] can not be used for its viability under the\nconditions \u03c1b \u221d a\u22123 and \u03c1c \u221d a\u22123 . So, to use the BAO\ninformation, we obtain the baryon drag epoch redshift zd\nnumerically from the following integration [27]\nZ \u03b70\nd\u03b7 \u2032 \u03c4\u0307d\n\u03c4 (\u03b7d ) \u2261\n\u03b7\n\n=\n\nZ\n\nzd\n\ndz\n\n0\n\nd\u03b7 xe (z)\u03c3T\n=1\nda\nR\n\n(25)\n\nwhere R = 3\u03c1b /4\u03c1\u03b3 , \u03c3T is the Thomson cross-section and\nxe (z) is the fraction of free electrons. Then the sound\nhorizon is\nZ \u03b7(zd )\nrs (zd ) =\nd\u03b7cs (1 + z).\n(26)\n0\n\np\nwhere cs = 1/ 3(1 + R) is the sound speed. Also, to\nobtain unbiased parameter and error estimates, we use\nthe substitution [27]\ndz \u2192 dz\n\nr\u0302s (z\u0303d )\nrs (zd ),\nr\u0302s (zd )\n\n(27)\n\nwhere dz = rs (z\u0303d )/DV (z), r\u0302s is evaluated for the fiducial\ncosmology of Ref. [25], and z\u0303d is redshift of drag epoch\nobtained by using the fitting formula [26] for the fidu2\ncial cosmology. Here DV (z) = [(1 + z)2DA\ncz/H(z)]1/3 is\nthe 'volume distance' with the angular diameter distance\nDA . In this paper, for BAO information, the SDSS data\npoints from [25] are used. For CMB data set, the temperature power spectrum from WMAP 7-year data [30]\nare employed as dynamic constraint.\nC.\n\nFitting Results and discussion\n\nAfter running 8 independent chains and checking the\nconvergence to stop sampling when R \u2212 1 is of order\n\n0.01, the global fitting results are summarized in Table I and Figure 3. We find that the minimum \u03c72 is\n\u03c72min = 8009.424 which is a little bigger than that for\n\u039bCDM model 8009.116 for the same cosmic observational\ndata sets combination. From the Table I, one can see\nthat small values of c2s = \u03b1 are favored in this unified\ndark fluid model when the WMAP 7-year observation,\nSN Union2 and BAO data points are used as cosmic constraint. It is worth to mention that our result is consistent with that reported in Ref. [14] where a relative loose\nconstraint \u03b1 = 0.01 \u00b1 0.02 was given. Correspondingly,\nwe plot the CMB power spectrum for the mean values\nestimated from MCMC analysis in Figure 4, where the\nobservational data points of 7-year WMAP with uncertainties are also included. As comparisons, the CMB\ntemperature power spectrum for \u039bCDM with same cosmic observational data sets combination and results from\n[30] are also shown. One can see that the CMB power\nspectrum for this unified dark fluid model is well inside\nthe error bars of the binned measurements from WMAP\n7-year results and almost matches to \u039bCDM model. This\nstrongly implies that current cosmic observational data\ncombinations of SN Union2, BAO and WMAP 7-year can\nnot almost discriminate a unified dark fluid with constant adiabatic sound speed from \u039bCDM model, though\n\u039bCDM model is still slightly favored.\n\nPrameters\nMean with errors\n\u03a9b h2\n0.0225+0.000504+0.000979\n\u22120.000499\u22120.000992\n\u03b8\n1.0484+0.00246+0.00491\n\u22120.00245\u22120.00487\n\u03c4\n0.0874+0.00607+0.0243\n\u22120.007010.0225\n\u03b1\n0.000487+0.000117+0.000728\n\u22120.000487\u22120.000487\nBs\n0.229+0.0134+0.0274\n\u22120.0133\u22120.0249\nns\n0.975+0.0132+0.0265\n\u22120.0131\u22120.0249\nlog[1010 As ]\n3.081+0.0331+0.0663\n\u22120.0327\u22120.0616\n\u03a9d\n0.956+0.00152+0.00298\n\u22120.00150\u22120.00300\nAge/Gyr\n13.699+0.108+0.210\n\u22120.1085\u22120.215\n\u03a9b\n0.044+0.00150+0.00300\n\u22120.00152\u22120.00298\nzre\n10.523+1.1948+2.393\n\u22121.1618\u22122.299\nH0\n71.341+1.278+2.573\n\u22121.268\u22122.478\nTABLE I.

The shade regions show the mean likelihood of the samples.\n\nUp to now, by using the geometric informations from\nSN, BAO and CMB data sets, one has obtained a relative tight constraint to the model parameter space. However, for any real Universe model, one needs to consider\nthe large scale structure formation. That is to say, the\ndynamic evolution information from galaxy formation\nwould be employed. It is not an easy issue for unified\n\nIV.\n\nSUMMARY\n\nIn this paper, we have studied a unified dark fluid\nmodel with constant adiabatic sound speed c2s = \u03b1. This\nproperty is called dark degeneracy. By using MCMC\nmethod with current available cosmic observational data\nsets combinations of SN Unioin2, BAO and WMAP 7-\n\ndark fluid model. Here, we just show that the smaller\nvalues of \u03b1 < 10\u22125 are required for matching the matter (baryon) power spectra data points from SDSS DR7\n[31], please see Figure 5. It means that when the dynamic information is used, for example large scale structure formation, a tighter constraint will be obtained. For\nthe constraint to this unified dark fluid model from large\nstructure information, we leave it for the future work.\n\nyear results, we find that small values of \u03b1 are favored\nin this unified dark fluid model as shown in Table I and\nFigure 3. For small values of \u03b1, this unified dark fluid\nmodel approaches to \u039bCDM model closely. Our analysis\nshows that \u039bCDM model is still slightly favored when\nSN Union2, BAO and WMAP 7-year observational results as useful constraint.
