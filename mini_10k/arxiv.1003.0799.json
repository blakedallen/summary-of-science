The shears structure in these nuclei originate due to proton holes in g9/2 orbital and\nneutron particles in h11/2 /g7/2 /d5/2 orbitals. The bands originating from shears mechanism\nexhibit sequences of magnetic-dipole (M1) transitions and thus, are often referred to as\nM1 bands. The observed Routhians and transition rates in these bands have been well\ndescribed in the framework of Tilted Axis Cranking (TAC) [7, 8] which show that the\ntotal angular momentum is almost completely generated by the valance proton and neutron\nangular momenta. Thus, the different observed features of these Shears bands can also\nbe described successfully by a semi-classical geometric model by Clark and Macchiavelli\n[3, 9] which involves the coupling of the two angular momentum vectors of protons and\nneutrons, namely j\u22a5 and jk . In this model, the observed band head spin is generated by\nthe perpendicular coupling of j\u22a5 and jk . So, at the band head, the angle (\u03b8) between them\n(called shears angle) is 90\u25e6 . The higher spin states of the band originate due to gradual\nclosing of these two vectors around their resultant which resembles the closing blades of a\npair of shear and the excitation energy along the band increases due to the potential energy\nassociated with reorientation the two vectors. Thus, in this model the highest spin state for\na given particle-hole configuration is obtained when the two vectors are fully aligned (\u03b8 = 0).\nThe phenomenon of band crossing in Shears Band is quite similar to that found in the\ncase of collective rotation, i.e at bandcrossing, the observed angular momentum is generated\nat a lower energy by a new higher quasi-particle configuration [2, 10\u201312]. However, the two\nband crossings can be described in two different ways. In case of collective rotation, the\nbandcrossing is associated to the alignment of a pair of quasi-particles to the rotational axis\nwhose angular momentum adds to the rotational angular momentum. Thus, if the energy\nneeded to break the pair (coupled to zero angular momentum) is lower than that needed\nto generate the angular momentum through collective rotation, then the bandcrossing is\nobserved. On the other hand, the bandcrossing in Shears band happens due to a new\nconfiguration which can reproduce the same angular momentum at a larger shear angle i.e\nat a lower energy. This happens because the magnitude of the vector(s) or the length(s) of\nthe shear blade(s) increases due to participation of two more particles or holes in forming\nthe new shear structure. The higher angular momentum states after the band crossing are\nthen obtained by re-closing of the newly formed shear blades. Thus, the bandcrossing in\nShears band can be related to the reopening of the shear angle.\n2\n\n\fThe validity of this geometric picture can be tested by the measurement of magnetic\ndipole transition B(M1) rates before and after the band crossing along a Shears band. This\nrate is proportional to the square of the perpendicular component of the magnetic moment\nand thus, decrease as the shears close [3]. However, as the shear angle reopens after the\nband crossing, it is expected that the B(M1) rates will increase immediately after the band\ncrossing followed by the characteristic drop which would indicate the closing of the new\nshears structure. This feature was observed in\n\n196\n\nPb [10] where the reopening of the shears\n\nangle was caused by the alignment of an i13/2 neutron pair. Before the band crossing the\nB(M1) rates were found to drop from 2.4 to 0.7 \u03bcN 2 while after the crossing the values\nincreased to \u223c 9 \u03bcN 2 and drop to 1.8 \u03bcN 2 with increasing spin.\nIn the mass-100 region, a band crossing in Shears band was first reported in\n\n108\n\nCd by\n\nThorslund et al.[13]. This negative parity band (labeled as Band 5 in [13]) comprises of a\nsequence of ten M1 transitions namely, 121, 316, 522, 677, 466, 362, 482, 590, 706 and 798\nkeV. Thus, it is apparent that the smooth parabolic behavior of the Shears band is broken\nafter 677 keV transition and a new sequence develops beyond 466 keV transition. The\nconfiguration before band crossing was suggested to be \u03c0[g9/2 \u22122 ]j=8 \u2297 \u03bd[h11/2 1 (g7/2 /d5/2 )1 ]\nand the bandcrossing was assigned to \u03bd(h11/2 )2 alignment. The lifetimes of the levels in\n\u22123\ng7/2 ] \u2297 \u03bd[h11/2 (g7/2 /d5/2 )]\nthis band were measured by Kelsall et al. [2]. In this work, \u03c0[g9/2\n\nconfiguration was assigned to this band before the neutron alignment based on the observed\nbandhead energy and B(M1) rates. The measured B(M1) rates showed the characteristic fall\nas a function of angular momentum after the neutron alignment. However, this fall was not\nobserved before the alignment. Thus, the phenomena of band crossing in Shears band could\nnot be established in\n\n108\n\nCd. In the present work, we have re-measured the level lifetimes\n\nof this band by analyzing the observed lineshapes of all the transitions except 121 and 798\nkeV.\nThe high spin levels of\nusing 65 MeV\n\n13\n\n108\n\nCd were populated through\n\n100\n\nMo (13 C, 5n\u03b3)\n\n108\n\nCd reaction\n\nC beam from 15-UD Pelletron at Inter University Accelerator Centre, New\n\nDelhi [14] . The gamma rays were detected by an array of eight compton suppressed Clover\ndetectors. The detectors were mounted on two opposite rings at nominal angles 79\u25e6 and\n139\u25e6 with respect to the beam direction. The target was made up of 1 mg/cm2 of enriched\n(96%) 100 Mo backed with a 9 mg/cm2 natural Pb. The 8\u00d7108 two-fold coincidence data were\nsorted in a symmetric and an asymmetric angle dependent matrix using the sorting program\n3\n\n\fINGASORT [15]. The symmetric matrix was analyzed with RADWARE program ESCL8R\n[16, 17] to build the level scheme of\ngamma-transitions to the Band 5 of\n\n108\n108\n\nCd. The present data confirmed the placement of\n\nCd as reported in the reference [2].\n\nThe asymmetric matrix was analyzed using the program DAMM [18] to extract the\nlineshapes of the gamma transitions of the Shears Band. The lineshapes were observed\nabove the I\u03c0 =13\u2212 level and were extracted using the 121 keV gate. The lineshapes of 316\n(I\u03c0 =14\u2212 ) and 522 (I\u03c0 =15\u2212 ) keV transitions were also extracted from 677 (I\u03c0 =16\u2212 ) keV\ngate. The level lifetimes were estimated by using the LINESHAPE analysis code of Wells\nand Johnson [19]. The analysis procedure has been described in detail in reference [4].\nThe intensity of the topmost transition namely, 798 keV, was too weak for the lineshape\nanalysis. Thus, the effective lifetime for 21\u2212 was found by fitting the observed lineshape of\n704 keV transition by assuming 100% side-fit. The estimated effective lifetime was 0.80(7)\nps. For 20\u2212 level, the effective lifetime of 21\u2212 level and side-feeding lifetime were considered\nas input parameters. The side feeding intensity was fixed to reproduce the observed intensity\npattern of the band. In this way, each lower level was added one by one and fitted until\nall the seven levels were included in a global fit where only the in-band and side feeding\nlifetimes were allowed to vary. This procedure of global fit was repeated for the forward\nand backward spectra. The lineshapes of 316 and 522 keV transitions in 677 keV gate were\nfitted by assuming 100% top-feed with a feeding lifetime equal to the effective lifetime of\nthe 16\u2212 level. The uncertainties in the level lifetimes were derived from the behavior of\n\u03c72 fit in the vicinity of the minimum. Fig. 1 shows the experimental and fitted lineshapes\nfor four gamma transitions in this Band namely 316, 522, 362 and 482 keV. The results of\nthe global fit are summarized in the Table I, where the lifetimes of 14\u2212 and 15\u2212 level were\nobtained from both 121 and 677 keV gates. It should be noted that the quoted errors do\nnot include systematic error in the stopping power values which may be as large as \u00b120%\n[1]. The lifetime of the 14\u2212 level has not been reported by Kelsall et al. [2]. In addition, in\nthe present work the lifetime of the 15\u2212 level has been found to be 0.39(4) ps which differs\nsubstantially from the previously reported value of 0.69(6) ps [2]. The lifetimes deduced for\nall other levels are in good agreement with the previously reported values.\nThe estimated B(M1) transition rates have been deduced from the standard formula [20]\nand listed in Table I. It is evident from the evaluated B(M1) rates that the values decrease\nas a function of angular momentum till I\u03c0 = 16\u2212 and beyond I\u03c0 =17\u2212 there is a distinct\n4\n\n\fincrease, followed again by a fall. This observation is very similar to that in\n\n196\n\nPb [10] and\n\nthus, can be associated with a band crossing in this Shears band.\nIn order to establish this assumption, the energies and transition rates of the levels of\nthis Shears band have been calculated using the semi-classical model of Shears mechanism\n[9] and compared with observed values. In this model, the Shears angle (\u03b8) is the important\nvariable which can be derived using the equation\ncos\u03b8 =\n\nIsh 2 \u2212 jk 2 \u2212 j\u22a5 2\n2 jk j\u22a5\n\n(1)\n\nwhere, Ish is the shears angular momentum. Thus, the Shears angle associated with a\nspecific level depends on the configuration of the band. Kelsall et al., have established\n\u22123\n\u03c0[g9/2\ng7/2] \u2297 \u03bd[h11/2 (g7/2 /d5/2 )] as the configuration for this band where two of the proton\n\nholes are assumed to be antiparallel and therefore do not contribute to the Shears mechanism\n[2]. Thus, in the present work, jk has been assumed to be 3.5h\u0304 which corresponds to\nthe g9/2 proton hole and j\u22a5 = 11.5h\u0304 is determined to reproduce the band head spin of\n12h\u0304. This contribution comes from \u03c0g7/2 and \u03bd[h11/2 (g7/2 /d5/2 )]. After the band crossing,\n\u03c0[g9/2 \u22123 g7/2 ]\u2297\u03bd[h11/2 3 (g7/2 /d5/2 )] configuration has been assigned to the new band [2] whose\nband head spin is 17h\u0304. In order to reproduce this spin, j\u22a5 has been taken to be 16.5h\u0304. It\nis interesting to note that this assumption is in agreement with the experimental alignment\ngain of \u223c 5h\u0304 [13].\nUnder these assumptions, the shears angle has been calculated using Eq. 1 for every\nangular momentum state of the Shears band and the values are listed in Table II. It is to\nbe noted that the maximum angular momentum for this shears configuration is 20h\u0304 while\nthe band has been observed up to 22h\u0304. This small difference (10%) due to the core rotation\nis assumed to be a linear function of angular momentum. Thus, Ish = I \u2212 (\u2206R/\u2206I)(I \u2212 Ib )\n[1], where Ib is the band head spin (=12h\u0304) and (\u2206R/\u2206I)=0.4 for the present case.\nSince the core contribution is small, the energy levels of the band can be calculated\nfollowing the prescription of Macchiavelli et al. [9].\nEI \u2212 Eb = (3/2)V2 cos\u03b8I\n\n(2)\n\nwhere, EI is the energy of the level with angular momentum I, and \u03b8I is the corresponding\nShears angle and V2 is the strength of interaction between the blades of the shear.\nFigure 2(a) and (b) show the comparison with the data before and after the band crossing, respectively. The experimental level energies are best reproduced for V2 = 1.65 MeV\n5\n\n\fbefore the band crossing and V2 = 2.65 MeV after. It is interesting to note that for the\nabove mentioned configurations, there are three particle-hole combinations before and five\ncombinations after the band crossing. Thus, the interaction strength per pair is \u223c 550\nkeV. This is in good agreement with the observed systematics of\n\n110\n\nCd, where V2 = 4 MeV\n\nfor eight particle-hole combinations [1]. Thus, the observed systematics of V2 support the\nmodel of re-opening of the shear angle at the band crossing due to participation of two more\nparticles. This picture may be further clarified by calculating the B(M1) rates.\nIn the Fig. 3, the evaluated B(M1) rates have been plotted as a function of angular\nmomentum. These rates can be calculated in the present framework by [3]\nB(M1) =\n\n3 2\nj\u03c0 gef f 2 sin2 \u03b8\u03c0\n8\u03c0\n\n(3)\n\nwhere, gef f = g\u03c0 \u2212 g\u03bd , j\u03c0 = 3.5 and \u03b8\u03c0 is related to the shears angle (\u03b8) through\ntan\u03b8\u03c0 =\n\nj\u03bd sin\u03b8\nj\u03bd cos\u03b8 + j\u03c0\n\n(4)\n\nThe calculated values of \u03b8\u03c0 are tabulated in Table II. The value of gef f before and after\nthe band crossing was found to be 1.13 and 1.22, respectively. In this calculation, the single\nparticle g-factor of g9/2 proton, g7/2 neutron and h11/2 neutron were taken to be 1.27, -0.21\nand 0.21 respectively [5] and the normal parity neutron was assumed to have predominantly\ng7/2 character. The calculated values are shown as solid line in Fig. 3. There is a good\nagreement between the calculated and observed values and the characteristic variation of\nthe B(M1) rate before and after the band crossing has been well reproduced by the semiclassical model. Thus, the observed B(M1) rates are also consistent with the assumption\nthat the band crossing in the Shears band can be described as the reopening of the shears\nangle.\nIt is interesting to note that the previously assigned configuration [13] would predict the\nB(M1) rates to be \u223c4 times higher as for this configuration j\u03c0 = 8 as compared to 3.5 for\nthe present configuration. However, such large B(M1) transition rates have been reported\nfor a Shear band in the immediate even-even neighbor namely,\n\n110\n\nCd [1]. This band was\n\nassigned \u03c0[g9/2 \u22122 ] \u2297 \u03bd[h11/2 2 (g7/2 /d5/2 )2 ] configuration by comparing the observed B(M1)\nrates with TAC calculations. In Fig. 3, the measured values are plotted as open circles. The\ndotted line represents the calculated values from the present semi-classical model for the\nabove-mentioned configuration and is in good agreement with the observed values. Thus,\n6\n\n\fthe B(M1) rates in the Shears bands in this mass region can be used as a marker for the\nexcitation of protons across the N=50 core as they decrease by a factor of four in case of\ncore excitation.\nIn summery, the observed band crossing in Shears band of\n\n108\n\nCd can be understood in\n\nthe following way. The band head spin of 12h\u0304 is formed by two perpendicular vectors of a\nshear, jk = 3.5 and j\u22a5 = 11.5. The levels up-to I\u03c0 =16\u2212 , are generated by the closing of the\nshear angle from 90\u25e6 to 38\u25e6 . At I\u03c0 =17\u2212 , this shear closes and a new shear is formed where\ntwo more neutrons join j\u22a5 . Thus, j\u22a5 increases to 16.5 and the shear angle reopens to 90\u25e6 .\nThe higher spin levels up to 22h\u0304 are then generated by gradually closing the blades of this\nnew shear. In this picture, it has been assumed that an angular momentum of 2h\u0304 due to\ncore rotation has been linearly distributed over the levels of this band. Thus, the present\nwork establishes the phenomenon of band crossing in a Shears band in mass-100 region.\nThe authors would like to thank Professor A. O.
