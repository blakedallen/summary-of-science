Due\nto the current proliferation of extensions to the Standard\nModel, it is extremely difficult to decide among the large\nnumber of candidate models which one is the most favored. Even within the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model, which is arguably the most favored model in\nthe particle physics field, there still remains the problem\nof covering the entirety of the 107 dimensional parameter\nspace in any search meant to decide for certain whether\nsupersymmetry is a true symmetry of nature. Thus, this\nglobal, model-independent search attempts to cover the\nlarge remaining regions of signature space, to ensure that\nno possible hint of new physics is missed.\nThe overall strategy of this global search is to maximize the scope of data that is analyzed, use our expertise of the Standard Model to implement a global Standard Model prediction, and then to focus attention and\nscrutiny on genuine statistically significant outlying effects. To achieve these goals, a predominantly Monte\nCarlo based Standard Model prediction is generated.\nRather than adopting predefined signal and control regions, the entirety of the data are assumed to potentially\ncontain the first signs of new physics. At the same time,\nthe entirety of the data contribute information for constraining the small number of physically well motivated\ncorrection factors, which modify the Standard Model\nprediction. These adjustments are designed to give an\naccurate accounting of the degree to which we understand systematic effects. Those discrepancies which persist after these adjustments are considered as possible\ncandidates for evidence of new physics, and are subsequently further investigated and scrutinized. Those candidates for which one has reasonably ruled out an explanation in terms of a statistical fluctuation, a detector ef-\n\nfect, or background mismodelling, will provide the basis\nof claims of new physics. Further details of this global\nsearch may be obtained in a previous publication based\non 927 pb\u22121 of data [1].\n\nVISTA\nThis global analysis begins by identifying the objects\nof interest. Electrons, muons, photons, taus, jets, jets\ntagged as originating from a bottom quark, and missing\ntransverse momentum /ET with sufficiently large transverse momentum (pT > 17 GeV) are identified and reconstructed using standard CDF criteria. A set of global\nevent selection criteria is imposed in order to retain a\nwide spectrum of events at the highest transverse momenta for analysis. The events are partitioned into exclusive final states based on the objects that they contain. A\nlarge set of observables relevant to each final state is constructed from kinematic variables. They include object\ntransverse momenta, polar and azimuthal angles, angles\nbetween pairs of objects, masses of all combinations of\nobjects, and a number of more specialized observables.\nTo construct the Standard Model prediction, a diverse\nset of Monte Carlo generators are used to generate events\nto cover the entire spectrum of particle production at\nthe Tevatron. They include dijet production, photon+jets\nproduction, diphoton production, production of a vector\nboson in association with jets, production of a pair of\nvector bosons, and top quark pair production. Extremely\ncareful accounting of the multitude of backgrounds must\nbe made in order to ensure that no backgrounds are\nmissed and none are double counted. These background\nevents are subsequently reweighted according to a set\nof correction factors fit from data to take into account\nsystematic effects. They include the integrated luminosity, the k-factors of various Standard Model processes,\ntrigger and reconstruction efficiencies, and a number of\n\n\f-1\n\n120\n\nCDF Run II Preliminary (2 fb )\n\nNumber of Events\n\n100\n\nVista Final States\n\n-1\n\nCDF Run II Preliminary (2.0 fb )\nP = 0.00055\n\nl + l'+\nEntries: 399\n\n80\n\n30\n\n25\n\nCDF Run II data\nPythia Z(\u2192\u03c4\u03c4) : 23%\nPythia Z(\u2192\u03bc\u03bc ) : 22%\nPythia jj : 20%\nMadEvent Z(\u2192\u03bc \u03bc) j : 6.5%\nOther\n\n8\n\nSM= 26\nd= 49\n\n7\n6\n5\n4\n3\n2\n\n20\n\n1\n0\n\n60\n\n100\n\n150\n\n200\n\n250\n\n15\n\n40\n10\n\n20\n\n5\n\n0\n-6\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n2\n\n\u03c3\n\n4\n\n0\n0\n\n6\n\n50\n\n100\n\n68\n\n(a)\n\n150\n\n200\n\n\u2211p\n\n250\n(GeV)\n\nT\n\n(a)\n\n-1\n\nEntries: 19650\n\nVista Distributions\n\n3000\n2500\n\n-1\n\nCDF Run II Preliminary (2.0 fb )\nP = 0.0021\n\nl + l'+ pT jj\n\nNumber of Events\n\nCDF Run II Preliminary (2 fb )\n3500\n\n2000\n\n2.5\n\n2\n\n1.5\n\noverflow\n\n1500\n1000\n500\n0\n-10\n\n-8\n\n-6\n\n-4\n\n-2\n\n0\n\n\u03c3\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n0\n0\n\n200\n\n400\n\n600\n\n342\n\nCDF Run II Preliminary (2 fb )\nMass distributions: 5036\nWith bumps: 2316\n\n350\n\n500\n\n600\n\nNumber of Events\n\n14\n\n1000\n\n700\n\n1200\n(GeV)\n\n\u2211p\n\nT\n\n(b)\n\n-1\n\nCDF Run II Preliminary (2.0 fb )\nP = 0.0042\n\nl + l'+ pT\n16\n\n800\n\nCDF Run II data\nBaur W(\u2192\u03bc\u03bd)\u03b3 : 33%\nPythia Z(\u2192\u03bc\u03bc ) : 17%\nAlpgen W( \u2192\u03bc\u03bd) j : 9.9%\nMadEvent W(\u2192l \u03bd)j\u03b3 : 7%\nOther\n\n10\n\nSM= 5.7\nd= 16\n\n8\n6\n4\n\n12\n\n2\n0\n\n10\n\n-1\n\n400\n\n0.5\n\n10\n\nFIGURE 1.

The label in the top left corner of each plot\nshows the identified objects present in each final state, where l\u00b1\nis a lepton (e or \u03bc ), l' is an additional lepton of different flavor, j\ndenotes a jet and 6 pT represents missing transverse momentum.\nThe region identified as having the most significant excess of\ndata over background is indicated by the blue line and displayed\nin the inset. The significance of the excess is shown by the value\nof P in the top right corner.\n\n\ffake rates [1]. The values of these factors are obtained\nby maximizing the global agreement with data in the\npopulations of the exclusive final states, subject to external constraints from theory calculations and other experimental results. The degree to which any particular discrepancy may be resolved by an adjustment of the correction factors simply reflects the degree to which systematic effects are not well understood enough to constrain\nthose factors.\nHaving implemented the entire Standard Model prediction, it is possible to make a global comparison between the data and the prediction. Using Poisson statistics and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, the Vista global\ncomparison quantifies the degree to which the populations of the exclusive final states and the shapes of the\nkinematic observables agree with the prediction. The results are shown in Figure 1. After accounting for the trials\nfactor associated with searching in multiple final states,\nwe find no statistically significant discrepancy from the\nStandard Model prediction in the populations. Of the\n19650 kinematic observables that are investigated, 555\nactually do exhibit a statistically significant discrepancy.\nHowever, further investigation and analysis of those effects reveal that they likely arise from a difficulty in modelling soft QCD jet emission in the underlying Monte\nCarlo events. In particular, they are attributed to the fact\nthat the Pythia showering parameters are not particularly\nwell tuned to the Tevatron data [1].\n\nBUMP HUNTER\nHaving gained confidence in the Standard Model background prediction from the results of the Vista global\ncomparison, we are able to use more specialized statistical tools to look for new physics. An algorithm called the\nBump Hunter searches in a total of 5036 mass variables\nto find local excesses of data over background suggestive\nof resonant production of new particles [2]. All mass distributions are scanned in windows whose sizes are consistent with the detector resolution, implicitly assuming\nthat the intrinsic width of the new particle is narrower by\ncomparison, and the window with the most significant\nexcess of data over background is selected. Certain quality criteria are imposed to eliminate pathological cases.\nThe results are summarized in Figure 2. The shift between the expectation from pseudo-experiments and the\nobserved data is due to the fact that this algorithm is sensitive to local mismodelling in the background, illustrating the well known fact that the Monte Carlo events do\nnot perfectly reproduce the data. There is one genuinely\noutlying excess, which warranted further scrutiny. This\nbump has a significance of 4.1\u03c3 after accounting for the\ntrials factor, and occurs in the mass of all jets in the 4-jet\nfinal state. The region that is selected coincides with the\n\nregion in which the well established soft jet emission discrepancy lies. As a result, one concludes that the effect is\nlikely due to the same underlying QCD parton showering\nissue and is unlikely to be new physics.\n\nSLEUTH\nFinally, an algorithm called S LEUTH attempts to find\nstatistically significant excesses in the tail of the \u2211 pT\ndistribution. Each semi-infinite region beginning with\neach data point and extending to infinity are considered\nand the one exhibiting the most significant excess of data\nover background is selected in each final state.\nThe three most significant S LEUTH final states are\nshown in Figure 3. The significance of the top S LEUTH\ndiscrepancy is 0.00055. After accounting for the trials\nfactor, this significance translates to a final probability of\n8% that hypothetically similar CDF experiments would\nyield a final state that is as or more interesting than the\nmost interesting final state found.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\nCDF has completed a model-independent global search\nfor new physics in 2.0 fb\u22121 of data. The populations of\nthe 399 final states exhibit no statistically significant discrepancies relative to our Standard Model implementation. Of the 19650 kinematic observables that are examined, 555 show clearly significant deviations from the\nprediction. Most of these are found to be due to difficulties in modelling soft QCD jet emission and in tuning\nthe Pythia showering parameters to the Tevatron data,\nwhich also explains the only significant outlier in the\nsearch for mass resonances in 5036 mass distributions.\nThe small number of remaining shape discrepancies is\nunderstood to be due to the overall crudeness of the correction model. Finally, the S LEUTH statistic, while pointing out the interesting signature of same sign, opposite\nflavour dilepton events in the top three final states, revealed no statistically significant excess at high \u2211 pT .\nUnfortunately, this analysis is unable to make any discovery claims of new physics.\n\nREFERENCES\n1.
