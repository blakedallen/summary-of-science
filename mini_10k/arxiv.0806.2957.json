The Lagrangian density of the weak interactions\nshould be reconsidered by starting from the massive vector boson fields which couple to\nthe fermion currents as the initial ingredients.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe whole idea of the symmetry breaking has been critically examined in the recent textbook [1], and the physics of the spontaneous symmetry breaking is, by now, understood\nin terms of the standard knowledge of quantum field theory. In particular, if one wishes to\nunderstand the vacuum state in a field theory model of fermions, then one has to understand the structure of the negative energy states of the corresponding field theory model.\nThe importance of the negative energy state in the Dirac field can be easily understood\nif one looks into the Dirac equation. In the Dirac equation, the energy eigenvalue itself is\nthe physical observable since it is written as\n(\u2212i\u2207 * \u03b1 + m\u03b2) \u03c8(r, t) = E\u03c8(r, t)\n\n(1.1)\n\nwhich means that the energy eigenvalue E must be physical. Therefore, if one obtains the\nenergy eigenvalue which is negative, then this negative energy itself must be physical. For\nthis, we have to always carry out the field quantization with anti-commutation relation,\nand this is equivalent to the realization of the Pauli principle. Under this Pauli principle,\none can construct the vacuum state of the corresponding field theory model by filling out\nall the negative energy states completely. If there is any hole in the vacuum state, then\nthis corresponds to the anti-particle state which is an observed fact.\nHowever, it is normally very difficult to construct the vacuum state of the interacting\nsystem, and in fact, the exact solution of the model field theory is practically impossible\n1\n\ne-mail:\ne-mail:\n3\ne-mail:\n4\ne-mail:\n2\n\nfffujita@phys.cst.nihon-u.ac.jp\nkusaka@phys.cst.nihon-u.ac.jp\nnobita@phys.cst.nihon-u.ac.jp\noshima@phys.cst.nihon-u.ac.jp\n\n1\n\n\fin four dimensions. Nevertheless, the physics of the spontaneous symmetry breaking is\nnow clearly understood and some of the model field theory prefer the vacuum state which\nbreaks the chiral symmetry though there exists no massless (Goldstone) boson. In this\nrespect, one can say that the symmetry breaking physics can be understood only after one\nsolves the whole system of the corresponding field theory model. One cannot understand\nits physics by rewriting the Lagrangian density into a new shape since the Lagrangian\ndensity itself cannot be any physical observables. From the Lagrangian density, one can\nlearn a symmetry property of the model field theory.\nIn this respect, the physics of the Higgs mechanism [2] is very vague, and as we will\nshow below, the whole procedure of the Higgs mechanism was carried out with simpleminded mistakes. This is mainly connected to the misunderstanding of the gauge fixing\nwhere one degree of freedom of the gauge fields must be reduced in order to solve the\nequations of motion of the gauge fields. Therefore, one cannot insert the condition of the\ngauge fixing into the Lagrangian density. This is clear since the Lagrangian density only\nplays a role for producing the equation of motions. Indeed, the Lagrangian density itself is\nnot directly a physical observable, and the Hamiltonian constructed from the Lagrangian\ndensity is most important after the fields are quantized. For the field quantization, one\nhas to make use of the gauge fixing condition which can determine the gauge field A\u03bc\ntogether with the equation of motions. This means that only the final Lagrangian density\nis relevant to the description of physical observables, and thus the success of the GlashowWeinberg-Salem model [3, 4, 5] is entirely due to the final version of the weak Hamiltonian\nwhich is not at all the gauge field theory but is a model field theory of the massive vector\nfields which couple to the fermion currents.\n\n2\n\nGauge Fixing\n\nThe Lagrangian density of the Higgs mechanism is given as\n\u00112\n1\n1 \u0010\n1\nL = (D\u03bc \u03c6)\u2020 (D \u03bc \u03c6) \u2212 u0 |\u03c6|2 \u2212 \u03bb2 \u2212 F\u03bc\u03bd F \u03bc\u03bd\n2\n4\n4\n\n(2.1)\n\nwhere\nD\u03bc = \u2202\u03bc + igA\u03bc ,\n\nF\u03bc\u03bd = \u2202\u03bc A\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bd A\u03bc .\n\n(2.2)\n\nHere, we only consider the U(1) case since it is sufficient for the present discussions. The\nabove Lagrangian density is indeed gauge invariant, and in this respect, the scalar field\nmay interact with gauge fields in eq.(2.1). However, it should be noted that there is no\nexperimental indication that the fundamental scalar field can interact with any gauge\nfields in terms of the Lagrangian density of eq.(2.1).\nThe equations of motion for the scalar field \u03c6 become\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n(2.3)\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\n(2.4)\n\n\u2202\u03bc (\u2202 \u03bc + igA\u03bc )\u03c6 = \u2212u0 \u03c6 |\u03c6|2 \u2212 \u03bb2 \u2212 igA\u03bc (\u2202 \u03bc + igA\u03bc )\u03c6\n\u2202\u03bc (\u2202 \u03bc \u2212 igA\u03bc )\u03c6\u2020 = \u2212u0 \u03c6\u2020 |\u03c6|2 \u2212 \u03bb2 + igA\u03bc (\u2202 \u03bc \u2212 igA\u03bc )\u03c6\u2020 .\n2\n\n\fOn the other hand, the equation of motion for the gauge field A\u03bc can be written as\n\u2202\u03bc F \u03bc\u03bd = gJ \u03bd\n\n(2.5)\n\nwhere\n\no\n1 n\nJ\u03bc = i \u03c6\u2020 (\u2202\u03bc + igA\u03bc )\u03c6 \u2212 \u03c6(\u2202\u03bc \u2212 igA\u03bc )\u03c6\u2020 .\n2\nOne can also check that the current J\u03bc is conserved, that is\n\n\u2202\u03bc J \u03bc = 0.\n\n(2.6)\n\n(2.7)\n\nThis Lagrangian density of eq.(2.1) has been employed for the discussion of the Higgs\nmechanism.\n\n2.1\n\nGauge Freedom and Number of Independent Equations\n\nNow, we should count the number of the degrees of freedom and the number of equations.\nFor the scalar field, we have two independent functions \u03c6 and \u03c6\u2020 . Concerning the gauge\nfields A\u03bc , we have four since there are A0 , A1 , A2 , A3 fields. Thus, the number of the\nindependent fields is six. On the other hand, the number of equation is five since the\nequation for the scalar fields is two and the number of the gauge fields is three. This three\ncan be easily understood, even though it looks that the independent number of equations\nin eq.(2.5) is four, but due to the current conservation the number of the independent\nequations becomes three. This means that the number of the independent functions is six\nwhile the number of equations is five, and they are not equal. This is the gauge freedom,\nand therefore in order to solve the equations of motion, one has to put an additional\ncondition for the gauge field A\u03bc like the Coulomb gauge which means \u2207 * A = 0. In\nthis respect, the gauge fixing is simply to reduce the redundant functional variable of the\ngauge field A\u03bc to solve the equations of motion, and nothing more than that.\n\n2.2\n\nUnitary Gauge Fixing\n\nIn the Higgs mechanism, the central role is played by the gauge fixing of the unitary\ngauge. The unitary gauge means that one takes\n\u03c6 = \u03c6\u2020 .\n\n(2.8)\n\nThis is the constraint on the scalar field \u03c6 even though there is no gauge freedom in this\nrespect. For the scalar field, the phase can be changed, but this does not mean that\none can erase one degree of freedom. One should transform the scalar field in the gauge\ntransformation as\n\u03c6\u2032 = e\u2212ig\u03c7 \u03c6\nbut one must keep the number of degree of freedom after the gauge transformation.\nWhatever one fixes the gauge \u03c7, one cannot change the shape of the scalar field \u03c6 since it\n3\n\n\fis a functional variable and must be determined from the equations of motion. The gauge\nfreedom is, of course, found in the vector potential A\u03bc as we discussed above. In this sense,\none sees that the unitary gauge fixing is a simple mistake. The basic reason why people\noverlooked this simple-minded mistake must be due to their obscure presentation of the\nHiggs mechanism. Also, it should be related to the fact that, at the time of presenting\nthe Higgs mechanism, the spontaneous symmetry breaking physics was not understood\nproperly since the vacuum of the corresponding field theory was far beyond the proper\nunderstanding. Indeed, the Goldstone boson after the spontaneous symmetry breaking\nwas taken to be almost a mysterious object since there was no experiment which suggests\nany existence of the Godlstone boson. Instead, a wrong theory prevailed among physicists.\nTherefore, they could assume a very unphysical procedure of the Higgs mechanism and\npeople pretended that they could understand it all.\n\n2.3\n\nFinal Lagrangian Density\n\nAfter an improper gauge fixing, one arrives at the final Lagrangian density\n\u00112\n1\n1 \u0010\n1\n1\nL = (\u2202\u03bc \u03b7)(\u2202 \u03bc \u03b7) \u2212 u0 |\u03bb + \u03b7(x)|2 \u2212 \u03bb2 + g 2 (\u03bb + \u03b7(x))2 A\u03bc A\u03bc \u2212 F\u03bc\u03bd F \u03bc\u03bd\n2\n4\n2\n4\n\n(2.9)\n\nwhere we rewrite the Higgs field as\n\u03c6 = \u03c6\u2020 = \u03bb + \u03b7(x).\n\n(2.10)\n\nSince the real scalar field \u03b7 is supposed to be small and besides a real scalar field is\nunphysical [6, 7], it may be set to zero, that is, \u03b7 = 0. In this case, we arrive at the\nfollowing Lagrangian density\n1\n1\nL = g 2\u03bb2 A\u03bc A\u03bc \u2212 F\u03bc\u03bd F \u03bc\u03bd .\n2\n4\n\n(2.11)\n\nThis should be the final Lagrangian density of the Higgs theory, and it is nothing but the\nmassive vector boson field which has nothing to do with the gauge theory.\n\n2.4\n\nProper Gauge Fixing\n\nFor the equations of motion eqs.(2.3-5), one can make a proper gauge fixing such as the\nCoulomb gauge (\u2207 * A = 0) or the temporal gauge (A0 = 0). In this case, one can\nsolve the equations of motion properly, and one can calculate any physical observables\nwhich are, in this case, gauge invariant quantities like F \u03bc\u03bd in the classical field theory.\nFurther, we can quantize the fields \u03c6 and A\u03bc after the gauge fixing, and we can carry out\nthe perturbation theory since we have now the quantized Hamiltonian. But this must be\ncompletely different from the Higgs mechanism.\n\n4\n\n\f2.5\n\nHiggs Potential\n\nIn the Lagrangian density of the Higgs mechanism, one assumes a self-interacting field\npotential\n\u00112\n1 \u0010\nU(\u03c6) = u0 |\u03c6|2 \u2212 \u03bb2 .\n(2.12)\n4\nThis was originally introduced in the discussion of the spontaneous symmetry breaking\nphysics as a toy model [8]. But in the mean time, this scalar field potential is considered\nto be a fundamental potential. However, one may ask a question as to where this potential\nU(\u03c6) is produced from since the scalar field is obviously not a free field. Unless one can\nunderstand the basic origin of this potential U(\u03c6), it is extremely difficult to understand\nthe Higgs mechanism itself from the fundamental physics point of view.\n\n3\n\nWhat shall we do ?\n\nWhen experiments suggested that there might be heavy vector bosons exchanged between\nleptons and baryons in the weak processes, people wanted to start from the massive vector\nbosons. However, it was somehow believed among educated physicists that only gauge\nfield theories must be renormalizable. We do not know where this belief came from. In\nfact, there is no strong reason that only the gauge field theory is renormalizable. It is\nclear that QED is a good gauge theory which is renormalizable, and there is no conceptual\nproblem in QED which can describe all the experiments related to the electromagnetic\nprocesses. However, this does not mean that other non-gauge field theory models are not\nrenormalizable. In fact, the basic condition of the renormalizability must be concerned\nwith the coupling constant g which must be dimensionless [1].\n\n3.1\n\nRenormalizability of Non-abelian Gauge Field\n\nHowever, one should be careful for the renormalizability of the non-abelian gauge field\ntheory. As one can easily convince oneself, the non-abelian gauge theory has an intrinsic\nproblem of the perturbation theory [9]. This is connected to the fact that the color\ncharge in the non-abelian gauge field depends on the gauge, and therefore it cannot be\nphysical observables. This means that the free gauge field which has a color charge is\ngauge dependent, and thus one cannot develop the perturbation theory in a normal way.\nIn QCD, this is exhibited as the experimental fact that free quarks and free gluons are\nnot observed in nature. No free field is a kinematical constraint and thus it is beyond any\ndynamics. Therefore, one cannot discuss the renormalizability of the non-abelian gauge\nfield theory models due to the lack of the perturbation scheme in this model field theory\n[1, 9].\n\n5\n\n\f3.2\n\nMassive Vector Field Theory\n\nEven though the Higgs mechanism itself is meaningless, the final Lagrangian density\nmay well be physically interesting. This is clear since, from this Lagrangian density, one\ncan construct the Hamiltonian which can describe the experimental observables. In this\nrespect, we may write the simplest Lagrangian density for two flavor leptons which couple\nto the SU(2) vector fields W\u03bca\n1\n1\nL = \u03a8\u0304(i\u2202\u03bc \u03b3 \u03bc + m)\u03a8 \u2212 gJ\u03bca W \u03bc,a + M 2 W\u03bca W \u03bc,a \u2212 Ga\u03bc\u03bd G\u03bc\u03bd,a\n2\n4\n\n(3.1)\n\nwhere M denotes the mass of the vector boson. The fermion wave function \u03a8 has two\ncomponents. The fermion current J\u03bca and the field strength Ga\u03bc\u03bd are defined as\nJ\u03bca = \u03a8\u0304\u03b3\u03bc \u03c4 a \u03a8,\n\nGa\u03bc\u03bd = \u2202\u03bc W\u03bda \u2212 \u2202\u03bd W\u03bca .\n\n(3.4)\n\nThis Lagrangian density is almost the same as the standard model Lagrangian density,\napart from the Higgs fields.\n\n3.3\n\nRenormalizability\n\nThe most important of all is to examine the renormalizability of the massive vector boson\nfields which couple to the fermion currents [10]. In this sense, this is just similar to\nchecking the final Lagrangian density of the standard model itself whether it can be\nrenormalizable or not. This is beyond the scope of the present paper, but it should be\ndone in future.\n\nReferences\n[1] T.
