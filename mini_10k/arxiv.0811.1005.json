Many theoretical and numerical models of this fundamental problem have been developed during the past decade. These\nefforts are motivated in part by the fact that one of the\nmost fundamental mechanism of life, the transfer of RNA\nor DNA molecules through nanoscopic biological channels, can be described in terms of polymer translocation\nmodels. Moreover, recent advances in manipulating and\nanalyzing DNA moving through natural [1, 2] or synthetic nanopores [3] strongly suggest that such mechanical systems could eventually lead to the development of\nnew ultrafast sequencing techniques [1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9,\n10, 11]. However, even though a great number of theoretical [12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23] and\ncomputational [24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34,\n35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42] studies have been published\non the subject, there are still many unanswered questions concerning the fundamental physics behind such a\nprocess.\nThe best known theoretical approaches used to tackle\nthis problem are the ones derived by Sung and Park [12],\nand by Muthukumar [13]. Both of these methods study\nthe diffusion of the translocation coordinate s, which is\ndefined as the fractional number of monomers on a given\nside of the channel (see Fig. 1). Sung and Park use a\nmean first passage time (MFPT) approach to study the\ndiffusion of the translocation coordinate. Their method\nconsists in representing the translocation process as the\ndiffusion of the variable s over a potential barrier that\nrepresents the entropic cost of bringing the chain halfway\nthrough the pore. The second approach, derived by Mu-\n\n\u2217 E-mail:\n\u2020 E-mail:\n\ngauthier.michel@uOttawa.ca\ngary.slater@uOttawa.ca\n\nthukumar, uses nucleation theory to describe the diffusion of the translocation coordinate. Several other groups\nhave worked on these issues (see Refs. [14, 16, 17, 22] for\nexample), and many were inspired by Sung and Park's\nand/or by Muthukumar's work. However, such models\nassume that the subchains on both sides of the membrane remain in equilibrium at all times; this is what we\ncall the quasi-equilibrium hypothesis. This assumption\neffectively allows one to study polymer translocation by\nrepresenting the transport of the chain using a simple\nbiased random-walk process [15, 43, 44].\nIn the case of driven translocation, simulations monitoring the radius of gyration of the subchains on both\nsides of the membrane have shown that the chains are\nnot necessarily at equilibrium during the complete translocation process [35, 40]. However, as far as we know,\nno direct investigation of the quasi-equilibrium hypothesis has been carried out so far for unbiased translocations, although it is commonly used to conduct theoretical studies. For example, the fundamental hypothesis\nbehind the one-dimensional model of Chuang et al. [27]\nis that the translocation time is much larger than the\nrelaxation time so that the polymer would have time to\nequilibrate for each new value of s. Chuang et al. found\nthat the translocation time should scale like N 9/5 and\nN 11/5 with and without hydrodynamic interactions, respectively. Their assumption is indirectly supported by\nthe observation made by Guillouzic and Slater [45] using\nMolecular Dynamics simulation with explicit solvent that\nthe scaling exponent of the translocation time \u03c4 with respect to the polymer length N (\u03c4 \u223c N 2.27 ) is larger than\nthe one measured for the relaxation time (\u03c4r \u223c N 1.71 ).\nWe recently made similar observations for larger nanopore diameters [46]. The main goal of the current paper is to carry out a direct test of the fundamental assumption that is behind most of the theoretical models\nof translocation: that the chain can be assumed as relaxed at all times during the translocation process (the\nquasi-equilibrium hypothesis). We will be using two sets\nof simulations to compare the translocation dynamics of\n\n\f2\n\nFIG. 1: Schematic representation of our simulation system.\nThe wall consists in a single layer of beads on an triangular\nlattice while the pore itself is formed by simply removing one\nwall bead (some wall beads and all of the solvents beads have\nbeen removed for clarity reasons). This simulation system\nis described in details in Ref [45, 46]. The trans-side of the\nmembrane is defined as the side where the chain terminates\nits translocation process (its final destination). The translocation coordinate s is defined as the ratio of the number of\nmonomers on the cis-side of the membrane, n, to the total\nnumber of monomers in the chain N (0 \u2264 s = n/N \u2264 1).\n\nchains that start with the same initial value of s but that\ndiffer in the way they reached this initial state.\n\nII.\n\nSIMULATION METHOD\n\nWe use the same simulation setup as in our previous publication [45, 46]. In short, we use coarse-grained\nMolecular Dynamics (MD) simulations of unbiased polymer chains initially placed in the middle of a pore perforated in a one bead thick membrane (see Fig. 1). The\nsimulation includes an explicit solvent. All particles interact via a truncated (repulsive part only) LennardJones potential and all connected monomers interact via\na FENE (Finitely Extensible Nonlinear Elastic) potential. The membrane beads are held in place on a triangular lattice using an harmonic potential and the pore\nconsists in a single bead hole. All quantities presented in\nthis paper are in standard MD units; i.e. that the lengths\nand the energies are in units of the characteristic parameters of the Lennard-Jones potential \u03c3\npand \u000f, while the\ntime scales are measured in units of m\u03c3 2 /\u000f where m\nrepresents the mass of the fluid particles. The simulation\nbox size is of \u223c 28.1\u03c3 \u00d7 29.2\u03c3 \u00d7 27.5\u03c3, where the third dimension is the one perpendicular to the wall, and periodic\nboundary conditions are used in all directions during the\nsimulation. We refer the reader to Ref. [45, 46] for more\ndetails. Note that this simulation setup was shown to\ncorrectly reproduce Zimm relaxation time scalings [46].\nThe simulation itself is divided into two steps; (1) the\nwarm-up period during which the ith bead of the polymer\nis kept fixed in the middle of the pore while its two subchains are relaxing on opposite sides of the wall, and (2)\nthe translocation (or escape) period itself during which\n\nFIG. 2: Schematic representation of our two sets of simulations, called R (for Relaxed) and NR (for Not Relaxed). For\nthe NR case, the middle monomer is kept fixed inside the\npore during the initial warm-up relaxation phase. The polymer then moves freely until it completely escapes from the\npore. However, the translocation clock then starts only when\nthe polymer reaches state s = s0 for the first time. In the R\ncase, the polymer is initially prepared in the s = s0 state and\nallowed to relax with its (N s0 + 1)th monomer fixed inside the\npore. The translocation clock then starts immediately after\nthe chain is released. The two sets of simulations thus differ\nonly in the way the initial chain is prepared.\n\nthe polymer is completely free to move until all monomers\nare on the same side of the membrane (note that the final location of the chain defines the trans-side of the\nmembrane in this study since we have no external driving force that would define a direction for the translocation process). The time duration of the first period was\ndetermined from previous simulations [45, 46] using the\ncharacteristic decay time of the autocorrelation function\nof the chain end-to-end vector. The time elapsed during\nthe second period is what we refer to as the translocation\ntime \u03c4 .\nIn previous papers [45, 46], we calculated both the relaxation time \u03c4r (N ) and the translocation time \u03c4 (N ) for\npolymers of lengths N between 15 to 31 monomers in the\npresence of the same membrane-pore system. Our simulation results, \u03c4 \u2248 1.38N 2.3 and \u03c4r \u2248 0.43N 1.8 in MD\nunits, indicate that the escape time is at least 10 times\nlonger than the relaxation time for this range of polymer sizes. These translocation times correspond to polymers starting halfway through the channel and the relaxation times were calculated with the center monomer\n(i.e. monomer i = (N +1)/2, where N is an odd number)\nkept fixed in the middle of the pore.\nAs we mentioned in the Introduction, the goal of this\npaper is to run two different sets of simulations in order to\ndirectly test the quasi-equilibrium hypothesis (see Fig. 2).\nIn the first type of simulations (that we will call NR for\nNot Relaxed ), we start with the same configuration as in\nthe previous paper: the polymer chain is initially placed\nhalfway through the pore, then allowed to relax with its\n\n\f3\nits translocation process.\nAlso interesting is the probability to escape on the\nside where the longest subchain was at the beginning of\nthe simulation. We observed (data not shown) that this\nprobability was always \u223c 10 \u2212 20% times larger in the\nR simulations. This observation also confirms the fact\nthat the chain is out of equilibrium during translocation\nsince its previous trajectory even affects the final outcome of the escape process. Note that we did verify that\nthis difference is not the reason why the escape times are\ndifferent.\n\nIV.\nFIG. 3: Translocation times \u03c4 for relaxed (R) and not relaxed\n(NR) polymers. The initial condition is s0 = 6/N for all\nmolecular sizes.\n\nmiddle monomer fixed, and is finally released. However,\nwe do not start to calculate the translocation time from\nthat moment; instead, we wait until the translocation coordinate has reached a particular value s = s0 for the first\ntime (see the top part of Fig. 2). The translocation time\n\u03c4 NR (s0 ) thus corresponds to a chain that starts in state\ns = s0 with a conformation that is affected by the translocation process that took place between states s = 1/2\nand s = s0 . In the second series of simulations (called R\nfor Relaxed ), we allow the chain to relax in state s = s0\nbefore it is released. In other words, the (N s0 + 1)th\nmonomer is fixed during the warm-up period (see the bottom part of Fig. 2); the corresponding translocation time\n\u03c4 R (s0 ) now corresponds to a chain that is fully relaxed in\nits initial state s = s0 . Obviously, the quasi-equilibrium\nhypothesis implies the equality \u03c4 NR (s0 ) = \u03c4 R (s0 ), a relationship that we will be testing using extensive Molecular Dynamics simulations. In both cases, we include all\ntranslocation events in the calculations, including those\nthat correspond to backward translocations (i.e., translocations towards the side where the smallest subchain was\noriginally found).\n\nIII.\n\nNR VS R: THE ESCAPE TIMES\n\nFigure 3 shows the translocation times obtained from\nthese two sets of simulations when we choose the starting\npoint s0 = 6/N (six monomers on one side of the wall,\nand all the others on the other side). We clearly see\nthat the translocation process is faster when the polymer\nis initially relaxed (R). The difference between the two\nescape times is around 25% for all polymer lengths N .\nSince the relaxation state of the chain at s = s0 is the only\ndifference between the two set of results, this indicates\nthat the NR polymers are not fully relaxed at s = s0 .\nThus, contrary to the commonly used assumption, even\nan unbiased polymer is not in quasi-equilibrium during\n\nNR VS R: THE RADII OF GYRATION\n\nAs we will now show, the slower NR translocation process is due to a non-equilibrium compression of the subchain located on trans-side of the wall. By compression,\nwe mean that the radius of gyration Rg of that part of\nthe polymer is smaller than the one it would have if it\nwere in a fully relaxed state.\nFigure 4 compares the mean radius of gyration of the\nsubchain on the trans-side at s = s0 for both the relaxed\n(R) and the non-relaxed (NR) states (the two first curves\nfrom bottom). The radius of gyration is larger for the relaxed state when the number of monomers is greater than\nabout 19, i.e. RgR (s = s0 ) > RgNR (s = s0 ) if N > 19. This\nis the second result that suggest the translocation process\nis not close to equilibrium. Moreover, this discrepancy\nbetween the two states increases with N (the two curves\ndiverge) over the range of polymer lengths studied here.\nFigure 4 also shows that this difference is negligible by the\ntime the escape is completed (RgR (s = 0) \u2248 RgNR (s = 0)).\nHowever, it is important to note that the final radius of\ngyration is always smaller than the value we would obtain for a completely relaxed chain of size N (the top\nline, Rg \u2248 0.357 N 0.631 ). Of course, this means that the\nR simulations, which start with equilibrium conformations, also finish with non-equilibrium states.\n\nV.\n\nTHE s(t) CURVE\n\nWhy do we observe such a large amount of compression\nwhen the translocation time is more than ten times larger\nthan the relaxation time? A factor of ten would normally\nsuggest that a quasi-equilibrium hypothesis would be adequate. The answer to this question is clearly illustrated\nin Fig. 5 where we look at the normalized translocation\ncoordinate s0 = s(t0 )/s0 as a function of the scaled time t0 .\nThese NR simulations used the initial condition s0 = 1/2\n(thus starting with symmetric conformations and maximizing the escape times). For a given polymer length,\neach s(t) curve (we have typically used \u223c 500 runs per\npolymer length) was rescaled using its own escape time\ntmax , such that t0 = t/tmax and 0 \u2264 t0 \u2264 1. These curves\nwere then averaged to obtain eight rescaled data sets (one\nfor each molecular size in the range 13 \u2264 N \u2264 31; note\n\n\f4\n\nFIG. 4: The radius of gyration of the longest subchain vs.\npolymer size N . We show values corresponding to the beginning (s = s0 = 6/N ) and the end (s0 = 0) of the process,\nboth for chains that were initially relaxed (R) and non-relaxed\n(NR). The fifth data set is the radius of gyration of a relaxed\nchain of length N [45, 46].\n\nthat N must be an odd number). Remarkably, the eight\nrescaled curves were essentially undistinguishable (data\nnot shown). This result thus suggests that the time evolution of the translocation coordinate s(t) follows a universal curve; the latter, defined as an average over all\nmolecular sizes, is shown (circles) in Fig. 5. Please note\nthat the translocation coordinate is defined with respect\nto the final destination of the chain (s = Ncis /N ), and\nnot the side with the shortest subchain at a given time.\nThis unexpected universal curve has two well-defined\nasymptotic behaviors: (1) for short times, we observe the\napparent linear functional\ns0 (t0 ) = 1 \u2212 0.318t0 ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhich we obtain using only the first 10% of the data, and\n(2) as t0 \u2192 1, the average curve decays rapidly towards\nzero following the power law relation\ns0 (t0 ) = 1.31 \u00d7 (1 \u2212 t0 )0.448 ,\n\n(2)\n\nthis time using the last 10% of the data. The whole data\nset can then be fitted using the interpolation formula\n2\n\ns0 (t0 ) = (1 + 0.130 t0 + 0.216 t0 ) \u00d7 (1 \u2212 t0 )0.448 ,\n2\n\n(3)\n\nwhere the coefficient of the t0 term is the only remaining\nfitting parameter. Equation 3 is the solid line that fits the\ncomplete data set in Fig. 5. As we can see, this empirical\nfitting formula provides an excellent fit.\nFigure 5 can be viewed as the percentage of the translocation process (in terms of the number of monomers\nthat have yet to cross the membrane in the direction of\nthe trans side) as a function of the percentage of the (final translocation) time elapsed since the beginning. The\nsmall shaded region in Fig. 5 represents the second material half (as opposed to temporal half) of the escape\n\nFIG. 5: Scaled translocation coordinate s0 = s(t0 )/s0 as a\nfunction of scaled time t0 = t/tmax , where tmax is the individual translocation time for each translocation event that\nwas simulated. Eight curves (not shown) were obtained for\nN = 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 27, and 31 the following way: for\na given chain length initially placed halfway through the pore,\n(1) each of the translocation events gives a s(t) curve that\ngoes from s(0) = 1/2 to s(tmax ) = 0, (2) then each of these\ncurves is rescaled in time using t0 = t/tmax , (3) and finally,\nthe time-axis is discretized and all the curves for that given\nN are averaged along the y-axis. Data points (circles) are the\naverage of these eight curves which are not shown since their\ndistribution was of the order of the data point sizes. The solid\nline that fits the universal curve represented by the complete\ndata set is given by Eq. 3. The inset presents the acceleration\n2\nof the scaled translocation coordinate d2 s0 /dt0 obtained from\nEq. 3.\n\nprocess (s = s0 /2). However, this region approximatively\ncovers only the last \u223c 12% of the rescaled time axis; this\nclearly implies a strong acceleration of the chain at the\nend of its exit. The first 50% of the monomer translocations take the first \u223c 88% of the total translocation time.\nThe inset in Fig. 5 emphasizes the fact that the translocation coordinate is submitted to a strong acceleration\nat the late stage of the translocation process.\nThis large acceleration of the translocation process is\nentropy-driven. At short times, the difference in size between the two subchains is small, and entropy is but a minor player. At the end of the process, however, this difference is very large and the corresponding gradient in conformational entropy drives the process, thus leading to\na positive feedback mechanism. Translocation is then so\nfast that the subchains cannot relax fast enough and the\nquasi-equilibrium hypothesis fails. The trans-subchain is\ncompressed because the monomers arrive faster than the\nrate at which this coil can expand. The ratio of ten between the translocation time and the relaxation time (for\nthe polymer lengths and initial conditions that we have\nused) is too small because half of the translocation takes\nplace in the last tenth of the event.\nFinally, the existence of a universal curve is a most interesting result. Clearly, our choice of rescaled variables\n\n\f5\nhas allowed us to find the fundamental mechanisms common to all translocation events. This universal curve is\nexpected to be valid as long as the radius of gyration of\nthe polymer chain is much larger than the pore size, and\nit demonstrates that our results are not due to finite size\neffects. Finally, we present in Appendix an asymptotic\nderivation to explain the apparent short time linear scaling of the translocation coordinate. This demonstration\nis based on the the fact that, in this particular limit, the\nmotion is purely described by unbiased diffusion, a case\nfor which we can do analytical calculations.\n\nVI.\n\nTHE Rg (T) CURVE\n\nStill more evidence that un-driven (no external field)\ntranslocation is not a quasi-equilibrium process is presented in Fig. 6a where we show how the mean radius of\ngyration of the subchain located on the trans-side of the\nwall changes with (rescaled) time during the NR translocation process (like in the previous section, we have\nchosen the initial condition s0 = 1/2 here). All the\ncurves have approximatively the same shape, i.e. an\ninitial period during which the radius of gyration increases rather slowly, followed by an acceleration period\nthat becomes very steep at the end. When these curves\nare rescaled by a three-dimensional Flory factor of N 3/5\n(Rg0 (t0 ) \u2261 Rg (t0 )/N 3/5 , see Fig. 6b), they seem to all\nfall approximatively onto each other. As we observed for\nthe translocation coordinate (s0 ), the radius of gyration\nRg (t0 ) is experiencing a noticeable acceleration at the end\nof the translocation process. Again, the shaded zone in\nFig. 6 shows that the second half of the process occurs\nin the last \u223c 11% of the translocation time.\nIf we assume that Flory's argument (Rg \u223c N 3/5 ) is\nvalid during the complete translocation process, we must\nbe able to translate the expression given by Eq. 3 in order\nto fit the increase of the radius of gyration presented in\nFig. 6b, i.e. we should have\nRg0 (t0 )\n\ns0 (t0 )\n=b\u00d7 1\u2212\n2\n\u0012\n\nFIG. 6: (a) Radius of gyration on the trans-side of the wall as\na function of the scaled translocation time. Each simulation\nevent is rescaled using the time tmax it took to exit the channel (t0 = t/tmax ). The scaled time is then always bounded between 0 \u2264 t0 \u2264 1. From bottom to top, the eight curves were\nobtained for N = 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 27, and 31 by averaging Rg (t0 ) over hundreds of simulations (typically \u223c 500\nruns). (b) Rescaling of the curves presented in part (a). Each\nradius of gyration curve was divided by N 3/5 to obtain the\ngray curves (Rg0 = Rg /N 3/5 ). The smooth curve is given by\nEq. 4 with a proportionality constant of 0.315. The shaded region covers the last 11% of the translocation time and begins\nat the mid-point of the average radius of gyration increases,\ni.e. at Rg0 (t0 ) \u2248 (Rg0 (1) + Rg0 (0))/2.\n\n\u00133/5\n,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere the 1 \u2212 s0 (t0 )/2 represents the fraction of the chain\nthat is on the trans-side at the time t0 and b is a length\nscale proportional to the Kuhn length of the chain. We\nused Eqs. 3 and 4 to fit the average of the eight Rg0 (t0 )\ncurves presented in Fig. 6b and obtained b = 0.315 (see\nthe smooth curve). This one-parameter fit does a decent job until we reach about 80% of the maximum time.\nHowever, it clearly underpredicts Rg in the last stage of\nthe translocation process, i.e. during the phase of strong\nacceleration discussed previously. This observation also\nvalidates the fact that the translocation process is out of\nequilibrium during that period. In fact, the failure of the\nthree-dimensional Flory's argument is also highlighted\nby the scaling of the radius of gyration at the end of the\ntranslocation process. Indeed, the third and fourth data\n\nsets presented in Fig. 4 have a slope that is around 0.73,\nwhich is closer to the two-dimensional Flory's scaling of\nRg \u223c N 3/4 .\n\nVII.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIn summary, we presented three different numerical results that contradict the hypothesis that polymer translocation is a quasi-equilibrium process in the case of unbiased polymer chains in the presence of hydrodynamic\ninteractions. First, we reported a difference in translocation times that depends on the way the chain conformation is prepared, with relaxed chains translocating faster\nthan chains that were in the process of translocating in\nthe recent past. Second, we saw that the lack of relax-\n\n\f6\nation also leads to conformational differences (as measured by the radius-of-gyration Rg ) between our two sets\nof simulations; in fact, translocating chains are highly\ncompressed. Third, perhaps the strongest evidence is the\npresence of a large acceleration of both the translocation\nprocess (as measured by the translocation parameter s)\nand the growth of the radius of gyration: roughly half of\nthe escape actually occurs during a time duration comparable to the relaxation time! The large difference between the mean relaxation and translocation times is not\nenough to insure the validity of the quasi-equilibrium hypothesis under such an extreme situation. It is important\nto note, however, that a longer channel would increase\nthe frictional effects (and hence the translocation times)\nwhile reducing the entropic forces on both sides of the\nwall; we thus expect the quasi-equilibrium hypothesis to\nbe a better approximation in such cases.\nThe curve presented in Fig. 5 is quite interesting. It\ndemonstrates that the translocation dynamic is a highly\nnonlinear function of time. We proposed an empirical\nformula (Eq. 3) to express the evolution of the translocation coordinate as a function of time (both in rescaled\nunits) that provides an excellent fit to our simulation\ndata. Based on Flory's argument for a three-dimensional\nchain, we presented a second expression (Eq. 4) of a similar form for the increase of the radius of gyration during\nthe translocation process. However, this relationship is\nnot valid for the complete translocation process, yet more\nevidence of the lack of equilibrium at the late stage of the\nchain escape.\nFinally, going back to the question in the title of this\narticle, we conclude that the chain shows some clear signs\nof not being in a quasi-equilibrium state during unforced\ntranslocation (especially at the end of the escape process). However, although the difference is as large as 25%\nwhen we start with only 6 monomers on one side, we previously demonstrated [45, 46] that this simulation setup\ngives the expected scaling laws. The latter observation is\nquite surprising and leads to a non-trivial question: why\nscaling laws that were derived using a quasi-equilibrium\nhypothesis predict the proper dynamical exponents for\nchains that are clearly out of equilibrium during a nonnegligeable portion of their escape? Perhaps the impact\nof these non-equilibrium conformations during translocation would be larger for thicker walls or stiffer chains; this\nremains to be explored. Obviously, the presence of an external driving force, such as an electric field, would lead\nthe system further away from equilibrium; we thus speculate that there is a critical field below which the quasiequilibrium hypothesis remains approximately valid, but\nbeyond which the current theoretical exponents may have\nto be revisited.\nThis work was supported by a Discovery Grant from\nthe Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council\nof Canada (NSERC ) to GWS and by scholarships from\nthe NSERC and the University of Ottawa to MGG. The\nresults presented in this paper were obtained using the\ncomputational resources of the SHARCNET and HPCVL\n\nnetworks.\n\nAPPENDIX: DERIVATION OF THE SCALED\nTRANSLOCATION COORDINAT IN THE\nSHORT TIME LIMIT\n\nIn the short time limit, the translocation variable diffuses normally from its initial position (the potential\nlandscape is very flat, see Fig. 2 in Ref. [13]). In such\na case, entropic pulling can be neglected and the translocation problem is equivalent to a non biased first-passage\nproblem in which the displacement x(t) from the initial\nposition as a function of time grows following a Gaussian distribution. Consequently, if diffusion is normal,\nthe scaled translocation coordinate is given by\n0\n\nZ\n\n\u221e\n\ns (t) =\n\u2212\u221e\n\n1\n\u221a\nexp\n2Dt\u03c0\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2212x2\n2Dt\n\n\u0013\n\ns0 (x) dx ,\n\n(A.1)\n\nwhere D is the diffusion coefficient and s0 (x) is the scaled\ntranslocation coordinate of the chain when it has moved\nover a curvilinear distance x(t). According to our definition of the scaled translocation coordinate s0 , the latter\nvalue is given by\n\uf8f1\nprob. exit same side\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4 z\u0012 }| \u0013{ \u0012\n\uf8f4\n\u0013\n\uf8f2\n1 |x|\n1\n1 |x|\n0\ns (x) =\n+\n\u2212\n\uf8f4\ns0 \uf8f4\n2\nL\n2\nL\n\uf8f4\n|\n{z\n}\n\uf8f3\ns(t)\n\nprob. exit other side\n\nz\u0012\n+\n\n}| \u0013{\n1 |x|\n\u2212\n2\nL\n\n\u0012\n\n\uf8fc\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\u0013\uf8f4\n|x| \uf8fd\n\n1\n, (A.2)\n+\n2\nL \uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n|\n{z\n}\uf8f4\n\uf8fe\ns(t)\n\nwhere L is the total length of the chain. The first\nterm is the probability to exit on the side where the\nchain is, times the corresponding translocation coordinate (s < 0.5). The second term refers to chains that will\neventually exit on the other side of the channel (s > 0.5).\nRemember that we defined the translocation coordinate\nwith respect to the side where the chain eventually exits\nthe channel. Consequently, the probabilities used in the\nlast equation are obtained from the solution of the onedimensional first-passage problem of an unbiased random\nwalker diffusing between two absorbing boundaries. The\nsolution to this problem is explained in great details in\nRef. [47]; the only result of interest for us is that the\nprobabilities to be absorbed by the two boundaries are\ngiven by 0.5 \u00b1 x0 , where x0 is the fractional distance between the particle position and the midpoint between the\ntwo boundaries.\nCombining the last two equations gives (using s0 =\n\n\f7\nwhich is equivalent to\n\n1/2)\n\u221e\n\n\u0012 2\u0013\n\u2212x\n1 \u2212 4x2 /L2\n1\nexp\ndx\n2Dt\n2s0\n2Dt\u03c0\n\u2212\u221e\n\u0012 2\u0013\nZ \u221e\n1\n\u2212x\n1\n\u221a\nexp\ndx\n=\n2s0 \u2212\u221e 2Dt\u03c0\n2Dt\n\u0012 2\u0013 2\nZ\n2 \u221e\n1\n\u2212x\nx\n\u221a\n+\nexp\ndx\ns0 \u2212\u221e 2Dt\u03c0\n2Dt L2\n4Dt\n= 1\u2212 2 ,\n(A.3)\nL\n\ns0 (t) =\n\nZ\n\n\u221a\n\n2Dtmax = (0.399L)2 .\n\n(A.5)\n\n(A.4)\n\nThis means that, if entropic effects are neglected, a chain\nwould travel a distance approximatively equal to 0.4 of\nits total length during a time equal to the observed translocation time. The fact that this result is smaller than\n0.5L (the value corresponding to complete translocation)\nis an indication that entropy accelerates the escape of the\nchain. The slope of \u22120.318 indicates that translocation\nwould be approximatively 3 times slower if entropic effects were cancelled. Finally, one should bear in mind\nthat our linear decrease prediction is for normal diffusion\nonly. However, Chuang et al. predicted an anomalous\ndiffusion exponent of 0.92 [27]. It would not be possible\nto observe the effect of such slightly subdiffusive regime\nwith the precision of our data here.\n\n[1] J. J. Kasianowicz, E. Brandin, D. Branton, and D. W.\nDeamer, Proc.
