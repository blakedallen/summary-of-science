Introduction\nFrom numerous X-ray observations (Fukazawa et al. 1998,\nSchmidt et al. 2002, Furusho et al. 2003, Sanders et al.\n2004, Fukazawa et al. 2004, Hayakawa et al. 2004, Pratt\net al. 2006, De Grandi et al. 2004 and Gitti & Schindler\n2004) it is well known that the intra-cluster medium (hereafter ICM) harbours on average \u223c0.6% heavy elements in\nmass, i.e. 0.3 in solar abundance. By using state of the art\nX-ray space telescopes it was found that the metals are\nnot homogenously distributed within the ICM. Metallicity\nprofiles show a relatively flat distribution in non-cool core\nclusters, while there is an increase in the central metallicity in cool core clusters (De Grandi et al. 2004, Vikhlinin\net al. 2005, Pratt et al. 2006).\nMany groups have derived recently detailed two dimensional metallicity maps (e.g. Sanders et al. 2004, Durret\net al. 2005, O'Sullivan et al. 2005, Sauvageot et al. 2005,\nSend offprint requests to:\nW.\nWolfgang.E.Kapferer@uibk.ac.at\n\nKapferer,\n\ne-mail:\n\nWerner et al. 2006, Sanders & Fabian 2006, Hayakawa et\nal. 2006, Finoguenov et al. 2006, Bagchi et al. 2006). All\nthese maps show an inhomogeneous distribution of the\nheavy elements with several maxima, complex metal patterns and a non-spherically symmetric distribution.\nMany processes were investigated to explain the origin of\nthese metals, i.e. galactic winds (De Young 1978), rampressure stripping (Gunn & Gott 1972), galaxy-galaxy\ninteractions (Gnedin 1998, Kapferer et al. 2005), active\ngalactic nuclei (AGNs)(Moll et al. 2006) and intra-cluster\nsupernovae (Domainko et al. 2004). Ram-pressure stripping, for instance, has been found in several Virgo cluster\ngalaxies by HI observations (Cayatte et al. 1990; Veilleux\net al. 1999, Vollmer et al. 1999, Vollmer 2003, Kenney\net al. 2004, Vollmer et al. 2004a,b; Koopmann & Kenney\n2004, Crowl et al. 2005, Levy et al. 2006). Galactic winds,\ndriven by supernova explosion within cluster galaxies have\nbeen observed and studied in detail in many systems in\nmultiple wavelengths (see reviews by Heckman et al. 2003\nand Veilleux et al. 2005). The mass fraction of metals in\n\n\f2\n\nW. Kapferer et al.: Metal enrichment of the intra-cluster medium over a Hubble time\n\nthese outflows depends on galaxy parameters and on environmental conditions. Martin (1999) found that the mass\nloss by galactic winds scales linearly with the galaxies star\nformation rate. It was shown, that in the centre of massive clusters the pressure of the ICM can suppress galactic\nwinds (Schindler et al. 2005). Also hydrodynamic simulations of outflows have been performed (Tenorio-Tagle &\nMunoz-Tunon 1998, Strickland & Stevens 2000).\nMany groups have investigated the chemical evolution\nof the ICM using numerical simulations. De Lucia et\nal. (2004) and Nagashima et al. (2005) studied the enrichment of the ICM with N-body simulations combined\nwith a semi-analytic galaxy formation model. Their conclusion is that nearly all metals found in the ICM are\nejected by supernova-driven galactic winds by the most\nmassive galaxies. Additionally they claim, that there is\na light chemical evolution since z = 1. So far, none of\nthese processes alone was sufficient to produce the observed pollution of the ICM. Therefore recent simulations\nwere not able to reproduce the observed amount and\nthe spatial distribution of metals in the ICM by galactic winds (Tornatore et al. 2004, Kapferer et al. 2006) or\nram-pressure stripping (Domainko et al. 2006). Whereas\nthe effects of galactic winds (e.g. Tornatore et al. 2004,\nScannapieco et al. 2006 and Romeo et al. 2006) or rampressure stripping (e.g. Domainko et al. 2006) on galaxies\nhave been studied analytically and numerically by many\nauthors, we focus mainly on the evolution and distribution\nof the metallicity in the ICM. In this paper we investigate\nthe impact on the enrichment of the ICM by ram-pressure\nstripping and galactic winds of cluster galaxies. Compared\nto our previous work (Schindler et al. 2005, Kapferer et\nal. 2006, Domainko et al. 2006, Moll et al. 2006) we extend this investigation to the epoch where the first galaxies form and compare the efficiency of galactic winds and\nram-pressure stripping over a Hubble time.\n\n2. Simulations\n2.1. Numerical methods\nAs described in Schindler et al. (2005), Kapferer et al.\n(2006) and Domainko et al. (2006) we apply different code\nmodules to calculate appropriately each of the galaxycluster components. The cosmological model used has the\nfollowing parameters: \u03a9m = 0.3, \u03a9\u039b = 0.7, h = 0.7,\n\u03c38 = 0.93, \u03a9b = 0.02h\u22122 .\n\n2.1.1. Dark Matter\nThe non-baryonic component is calculated using\nGADGET2 (Springel 2005) as an N-body code, with\nconstrained random fields as initial conditions (Hoffman\n& Ribak (1991), implemented by van de Weygaert &\nBertschinger (1996)). The N-body code provides the\nunderlying evolution of the dark matter (DM) potential\nfor the hydrodynamic code and the dynamically fully\ndescribed orbits of model cluster galaxies.\n\n2.1.2. Galaxy formation model\n\nThe properties of the galaxies are calculated by an improved version of the galaxy formation code of van\nKampen et al. (1999). The galaxy formation model is\nsemi-numerical in the sense that the merging history of\ngalaxy haloes is taken directly from the cosmological Nbody simulation. Halo mergers are identified in the Nbody simulations as events in which a new halo is formed\nthat is both virialised and contains at least two progenitors. We distinguish between major mergers, where two\nprogenitors have at least 30 % of the mass of the merger\nremnant, and minor mergers, which we treat as accretion\nevents. During any merger event, all galaxies involved undergo a starburst whose intensity depends on the progenitor/merger remnant mass ratio (small for minor mergers),\nand whose duration depends on the relaxation time of the\nnew halo (short in the case of minor mergers). Galaxygalaxy mergers are treated differently: all galaxies within\na dark matter halo or subhalo suffer from dynamical friction, and will merge with the central galaxy eventually.\nThe dynamical friction time scale is reset after a major\nmerger event (assuming that orbits will be randomized by\nthe event), but not after a minor merger event. When a\nsatellite galaxy merges with the central galaxy of a halo\nor subhalo, another starburst will occur, using up most\nof the cold gas left in the satellite. Not all is turned into\nstars due to feedback, however. In between merger events\nstar formation is quiescent, and we therefore have two\ntypes of star formation modes: quiescent star formation\nin disks with a threshold according to the Kennicutt criterion, and starbursts resulting from major merger events,\nincluding halo-halo and galaxy-galaxy mergers. Gas that\ncools within virialised haloes is assumed to settle in a disk\nwith an exponential profile. We use the models of Mo,\nMao & White (1998) to set the disk-scale length, with the\ndistinction that we measure the angular momentum of the\ndark halo from the N-body simulation data instead of assuming an analytical model for that. Stellar evolution is\nmodelled using the stellar population synthesis models of\nBruzual & Charlot (2003). The metallicity of the stellar\npopulations affects the cold and hot gas components of a\ngalaxy: a fraction of the metals formed in stars is ejected\nby SNe and stellar winds into the surrounding interstellar\nmedium (ISM). The metals that end up in the hot gas\ncomponent also affect the cooling rate, which depends on\nmetallicity (Sutherland & Dopita 1993). Chemical evolution is modelled as in Matteucci & Francois (1989), which\nincludes SN types I and II. The evolution of the metals is\nfollowed for the stellar populations as well as for the cold\nand hot gas reservoirs, and exchanges are also tracked.\nMaterial returned to the cold ISM by stellar winds and\nsupernovae has been chemically enriched by the nuclear\nprocesses inside the stars.\n\n\fW. Kapferer et al.: Metal enrichment of the intra-cluster medium over a Hubble time\n\n2.1.3. Hydrodynamics\nFor the treatment of the ICM we use a comoving hydrodynamic code with shock capturing scheme (PPM,\nCollela & Woodward 1984), with a fixed mesh refinement\nscheme (Ruffert 1992) on four levels and radiative cooling\n(Sutherland & Dopita (1993)). The major improvement\nwith respect to the previously used setup is the usage of\ncomoving coordinates, which was implemented in the hydrodynamic code by applying a operator splitting method.\nThis approach allows us to apply cosmological initial conditions for the hydrodynamic simulation. The largest grid\ncovers a comoving volume of (20 Mpc)3 . Each finer grid\ncovers 81 of the volume of the next larger grid. With a resolution of 1283 grid cells on each grid we obtain a finest\nresolution of (\u223c19.5 kpc)3 comoving for each cell on the\ninnermost grid. The N-body and hydrodynamics code are\ncalculated starting at z = 40, while the semi-numerical\ngalaxy formation covers the redshift interval from z = 20\nto z = 0.\nThis setup allows us to address questions like:\n\u2013 what is the efficiency of ram-pressure stripping versus\ngalactic winds as a function of redshift?\n\u2013 what is the spatial distribution of metals in the ICM\nejected by galactic winds and/or lost by ram-pressure\nstripping?\n\n2.2. Calculation of the mass loss due to galactic winds\nThe mass loss due to galactic winds is calculated using\nthe star formation rate (SFR) (M\u22c6 [Msun /yr]) of a given\ngalaxy, as proposed by Martin (1999). We use the same approach as Springel & Hernquist (2003), who found that a\nmass loss due to galactic winds \u1e40 = \u03b7M\u22c6 , with a constant\nfraction \u03b7, is reasonable to fit observations (see Springel &\nHernquist (2003) and references therein). The same was\nfound by Tornatore et al. (2004) who used \u03b7 = 2. This\nheuristic approach gives us the mass loss for a given spiral\ngalaxy, which we then add to the hydrodynamic simulation at the galaxy's position. The metals are mixed with\nthe ICM, which is already present in a computational cell.\nThe metallicity of the ejected gas is taken from the seminumerical galaxy model, which calculates the metals in\nthe hot and cold gas phase by\n\u1e41c = Zh \u1e40c \u2212 Zc (1 + \u03b2 \u2212 R)\u03a8SF + y\u03a8SF\n\n(1)\n\n\u1e41h = Zh \u1e40c + Zc \u03b2\u03a8SF + ZP rim \u1e40new ,\n\n(2)\n\nwhere Zc = mc /Mc (Zc the metallcity, mc the mass\nof heavy elements and Mc the mass of the cold gas),\nZh = mh /Mh (Zh the metallcity, mh the mass of heavy\nelements and Mh the mass of the hot gas), and \u1e40new is\nthe accretion of new baryons by the halo, \u03a8SF is the star\nformation rate, Zprim the primordial metallicity and \u03b2 the\nfraction of supernovae in a stellar population. This results\nin a lower limit for the metallicity of the galactic-wind\nejecta.\n\n3\n\n2.3. Calculation of the mass loss due to ram-pressure\nstripping\nTo calculate the mass loss of cluster galaxies due to\nram-pressure stripping we follow the classical Gunn &\nGott (1972) criterion. In this model, gas of galactic discs\nis stripped outside a certain stripping radius where the\nram pressure exceeds the restoring gravitational forces.\nAccording to Vollmer et al. (2001) the Gun & Gott (1972)\ncriterion extended for the inclination angle can explain\nthe HI deficiency of galaxies observed in the region of the\nVirgo cluster. We use the same approach as presented in\ndetail in Domainko et al. (2006) for sub- and supersonic\ngalaxies interacting with the ICM. The main parameters\nin the ram-pressure stripping routine are the relative velocity v of a galaxy with respect to the ICM, the density\n\u03c1ICM of the ICM and the surface density of both, the stellar Mstar and the gas Mgas mass in the model galaxy. As\nshown in Domainko et al. (2006) a certain stripping radius\nfor each galaxy, depending on the properties of the ICM\nand the galaxy, can be derived\n\u0012\n\u0013\nR0\nGMstar Mgas\nRstrip =\n\u00d7 ln\n,\n(3)\n2\nv 2 \u03c1ICM 2\u03c0R04\nwhere R0 is the disc scale length of the gas distribution in\nthe galaxy. Gaseous matter which is located outside this\nstripping radius is lost by the galaxy. As a consequence\nof the used PPM scheme in the grid-based hydrodynamic\ncalculations, shocks induced by merger events and their\npropagation throughout the cluster are well treated. These\nshock features have direct impact on the ram-pressure\nstripping.\n\n2.4. Combination of galactic winds and ram-pressure\nstripping\nWe combine both enrichment processes in a multi-step\napproach. First we select from the complete sample of\nmodel galaxies the spiral galaxies by requiring a significantly large (i.e. disk scale length larger than bulge radius) star forming, gaseous disk. In a second step the star\nformation rate in the disk is used to calculate the galactic wind mass loss as described in Sect. 2.2. In order to\ninvestigate the relative importance of both processes we\nstudy two extreme cases. First we consider a strong influence of ram-pressure stripping on the galactic winds. As\nlong as the galaxy has not fulfilled the criterion for rampressure stripping the galaxy is allowed to lose gas by\ngalactic winds. When the galaxy loses matter due to rampressure stripping, it will not be affected by galactic winds\nanymore. This avoids an overestimation of the mass loss\nby galactic winds, especially in the low redshift regime, i.e.\nz<1.5 where galaxy clusters form and dynamical enrichment processes like ram-pressure stripping become dominant. Numerous observational results point at a quenching\nof the star formation in galaxies, encountering the dense\nenvironment of the ICM (e.g. Haines et al. 2006, Gavazzi\net al. 2002). This description of the combined processes\n\n\f4\n\nW. Kapferer et al.: Metal enrichment of the intra-cluster medium over a Hubble time\n\nleads to a lower limit in the metal enrichment efficiency\nfor galactic winds at lower redshifts. As a second approach\nwe do not consider any influence of ram-pressure stripping\non the galactic winds. A galaxy can have a galactic wind\nand ram-pressure stripping at the same time. Note that\nhereafter the index a denotes the first and b denotes the\nsecond combination of the two enrichment processes.\n\n3. The properties of the model galaxy clusters\nIn order to investigate the efficiency of different enrichment processes we take a non-cooling flow cluster from\na sample of simulated merging systems, which is a lower\nmass cluster with several strong sub-cluster mergers. The\nsecond model cluster is a more massive merging system\nwith nearly more than twice the mass and several minor\nmerger events.\n\u2013 Model Cluster A: The cluster forms at z\u223c1.5 and\nhas two major merger events at z=0.8 and z=0.5. The\nfinal total mass is 1.5 \u00d7 1014 M\u2299 in a sphere of radius\n1 Mpc. We show the X-ray surface brightness and Xray weighted temperature map at different redshifts in\nFig. 1 and Fig. 3, respectively.\n\u2013 Model Cluster B: The formation redshift for this\ncluster is z\u223c1.7. It shows four minor merger events\na z=1.4, z=1.1, z=0.5 and z=0.3. The cluster has a\nfinal mass of 3.4\u00d71014 M\u2299 within a sphere of radius\n1 Mpc . We show the X-ray surface brightness and Xray weighted temperature map at different redshifts in\nFig. 2 and Fig. 4, respectively.\n\nFig. 1. X-ray surface brightness maps for different redshifts (z=1, 0.7, 0.5 and 0) for model cluster A. The maps\nhave 2.5 Mpc comoving on a side and give the X-ray emission in a logarithmic scale.\n\n4. Results\n4.1. X-ray weighted maps\nIn order to compare the model clusters with observations\nwe extract X-ray surface brightness, X-ray weighted temperature and metal maps at different redshifts. In Fig. 1\nX-ray surface brightness maps for model cluster A at redshifts z=1, 0.7, 0.5 and 0 are presented on a logarithmic\nscale. The area covers (2.5 Mpc)2 in comoving space. The\nfinal X-ray surface brightness map has a drop of \u223c 2 magnitudes from the cluster centre to r200 , which is consistent\nwith observations of non-cooling flow clusters (Arnaud et\nal. 2002, De Filippis et al. 2003). The hierarchical formation of the cluster is clearly visible, especially at redshift\n1, when the cluster is forming. At lower redshifts model\ncluster A shows an asymmetric shape, which is a common\nfeature for non cool-core clusters, that typically undergo\nseveral mergers. The model cluster begins to relax at redshift z=0, nevertheless the spherical shape has not fully\nestablished yet.\nIn Fig. 2 the X-ray surface brightness maps for model\ncluster B at different redshifts (z=1, 0.7, 0.5 and 0) are\npresented. In contrast to model cluster A, this cluster\nshows a rather relaxed shape already at z=0.7.\nIn Figs. 3 and 4 we show X-ray weighted temperature\nmaps for the model clusters at the same redshifts as in Fig.\n\nFig. 2. X-ray surface brightness maps for different redshifts (z=1, 0.7, 0.5 and 0) for model cluster B. The maps\nhave 2.5 Mpc comoving on a side and give the x-ray emission in a logarithmic scale.\n\n\fW.

The\nmaps have a size of 2.5 Mpc comoving and give the temperature in keV linear scale.\n\n1 and Fig. 2. The hierarchical growth of the model cluster A, which is a direct consequence of the initial power\nspectrum, is visible. After the formation along a filamentary structure, the cluster builds up via several mergers,\nwhich leads to the complex dynamical state of the gas.\nAt the present epoch the cluster has a distinct temperature distribution, see the 2.5 Mpc comoving maps, with\na drop towards the cluster outskirts in the order of 50%.\nModel cluster B shows a common feature of relaxed clusters, namely a drop in temperature towards the innermost\nregion, i.e. a cool core. As we are not interested in the\ngas dynamics of the cooling flow region, but rather in the\nlarge-scale distribution of the metals in the ICM, we do\nnot introduce a heating source to counterbalance the overcooling. However, due to our limited spatial resolution we\nunderestimate the cooling in this region, avoiding a cooling catastrophe. Hence, except of the innermost computational cells, the radial temperature profile resembles that\nof observed relaxed galaxy clusters.\nIn order to investigate the strength of the different enrichment processes and the spatial distribution of the metals, we construct X-ray weighted metal maps from our 3D\ndata. These maps can be compared to observations. In Fig.\n5 and Fig. 6 metallicity maps of the two model clusters\nfor the different enrichment process combinations descriptions a and b are presented. We construct them for redshift\nz=0 within an area of 2 Mpc in diameter. The left column\ncorresponds to the merging model cluster A, whereas the\nright column shows the relaxed system of model cluster\n\nB. In order to highlight the different spatial distribution\nof the metals emerging from the two different enrichment\nprocesses, i.e. ram-pressure stripping and galactic winds,\nwe show separate metal maps for each enrichment process\nalong with a map that gives the overall metal distribution.\n\n4.2. Mass loss by ram-pressure stripping and galactic\nwinds\nTo address the question on the different efficiencies of the\ntwo enrichment processes, we give in Table 1 and Table\n2 the integrated mass loss for the cluster galaxies in two\ndifferent redshift regimes for ram-pressure stripping and\ngalactic winds for enrichment process combination a and\nb. As the clusters form at redshifts z<2 and because rampressure stripping depends highly on the density of the\nenvironment, it is more important in this redshift regime.\nIn the case of enrichment combination b and model cluster\nB ram-pressure stripping is less important for enriching\nthe ICM. As galactic winds are not suppressed by rampressure stripping or the pressure of the ICM they nearly\nexhaust the gas reservoir of the galaxies. Galactic winds,\non the contrary, induce higher mass losses at higher redshifts. The mass loss by this process is mainly driven by\nthe supernova rate of a system, which is tightly linked to\nthe star formation rate. As the star formation rate peaks\nat redshifts larger than 2 (e.g. Hopkins 2004), the mass\nloss of galactic winds is the more dominant process for the\nremoval of gas from galaxies in this redshift regime.

X-ray weighted metal maps for the two model clusters in an area with 2000 kpc diameter for different enrichment processes at redshift 0, enrichment process combination a.\n\nFig. 6. X-ray weighted metal maps for the two model clusters in an area with 2000 kpc diameter for different enrichment processes at redshift 0, enrichment process combination b.\n\npressure stripping is in terms of total mass loss a factor\nof three more efficient than winds in model cluster A and\n50% in model cluster B for the enrichment process combination a. This can be explained by the merger events in\nmodel cluster A, which introduce disturbances in the ICM.\nThese increase the ram pressure onto the cluster galaxies.\nIn model cluster B the difference of mass loss between rampressure stripping and galactic winds is lower compared to\nmodel cluster A. Compared to the merging system, where\nalso in the outer regions of the cluster galaxies are affected by ram-pressure, in relaxed systems ram-pressure\nis predominately present in the central cluster regions\nand therefore not so efficient. In the case of enrichment\nprocess combination b the ratio of the mass loss between\nram-pressure stripping and galactic winds is comparable\nto enrichment process combination a for model cluster A.\nModel cluster B shows a different picture, mainly because\n\nenrichment process combination b does deplete remove too\nmuch gas from the galaxies by galactic winds, leading to a\nsmall amount gas left in the galaxies at the epochs when\nram-pressure stripping becomes more important. It seems\nthat in this case we underestimate the interaction between\nram-pressure stripping and galactic winds.\nIn Fig. 7 the mass loss of all galaxies due to rampressure stripping in a (5 Mpc)3 cube for both enrichment process description is presented. As ram-pressure\nstripping is strongly dependent on the environment the\nmass loss increases as the cluster forms, i.e. in the redshift\nregime z<2. In addition merging events increase the density in the ICM temporarily, leading to strong mass losses\nof galaxies passing this regions. Additionally, groups of\ngalaxies which belong to sub-clusters and enter the main\ncluster, fall into the cluster with high velocities and therefore increase the ram pressure. This again leads to tem-\n\n\fW. Kapferer et al.: Metal enrichment of the intra-cluster medium over a Hubble time\n\nTable 1.

Although the massive model\ncluster B show no major merger events, ram-pressure\nstripping is even more efficient than in the merging model\ncluster A for the enrichment process combination a. Due\nto the higher mass of model cluster B (more than twice\nas massive than cluster A), more massive galaxies which\nharbour more gas mass in the discs reside in it. As in addition the density in the cluster's central regions is higher\nthe mass loss is larger in model cluster B.\nFig. 8 gives the mass loss of all galaxies in a (5 Mpc)3\ncube for the galaxies for both enrichment process combinations due to galactic wind. The increase of mass loss by\ngalactic winds at redshift z\u223c2 in model cluster B has two\nreasons. There is an obvious connection between the mass\nloss efficiency of galactic winds and ram-pressure stripping and the formation history of a galaxy cluster. If the\nsystem is a merging system (several major events at all\nepochs) then the differences in mass loss between galactic\nwinds and ram-pressure are in the order of several 100%,\nresulting in ram-pressure stripping as the dominant enrichment process for both enrichment process combinations. In relaxed, massive systems the ratio drops significantly, for model cluster B ram-pressure stripping is only\n50% more efficient for enrichment process combination a.\nThe enrichment combination b leads to a contrary picture.\n\n1\nredshift\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n10\n\n2\n\nx 10\n\n1.8\n1.6\n\nModel Cluster A (Winds (a))\nModel Cluster A (Winds (b))\nModel Cluster B (Winds (a))\nModel Cluster B (Winds (b))\n\n]\n\n1.4\nsun\n\nModel\nredshift\nRPS a\nRPS b\nA\nz>2\n2.7%\n4.7%\nA\nz<2\n97.3%\n95.3%\nA\nrps mass loss 3.6\u00d71011 M\u2299 3.1\u00d71011 M\u2299\nB\nz>2\n4.8%\n42.4%\nz<2\n95.2%\n57.6%\nB\nB\nrps mass loss 6.8\u00d71011 M\u2299 1.7\u00d71011 M\u2299\nTotal mass loss (galactic winds and ram-pressure stripping)\nmodel cluster A enrichment combination a: 4.8\u00d71011 M\u2299 ,\nmodel cluster B: 1.12\u00d71012 M\u2299 - enrichment combination b:\n5.6\u00d71011 M\u2299 , model cluster B: 1.9\u00d71012 M\u2299 in a (5 Mpc)3\ncomoving volume.\nRPS....Ram-Pressure Stripping\n\n1.5\n\nFig. 7.

The\namount of matter lost by cluster-galaxies is a strong function of the number of cluster galaxies. As a more massive\nsystem has more galaxies the absolute value of mass loss is\nhigher than in the merging system. To what extent these\nmass losses enrich the ICM will be discussed in the next\nsection.\n\n\f8\n\nW.

Metallicity profiles\nObservers often give metallicity profiles of galaxy clusters.\nBy integrating X-ray events in radial bins it is possible to\nconstruct X-ray spectra to investigate metal abundances\nin a given annulus. With a longer exposure time or for\na higher luminosity of the galaxy cluster, more events by\nX-ray photons arrive at the detector. This makes it possible to increase the resolution of the metallicity profiles\nor to construct 2D maps of the metallicity of the observed\ngalaxy cluster. To compare our simulated ICM properties with observations we provide metal profiles and X-ray\nweighted metallicity maps.\nThe evolution of the mean metallicity in an area with 500\nkpc physical radius around the cluster centre is shown for\nboth model clusters and enrichment process combinations\nin Fig. 9. At z<1.2 there is a clear difference in metallicity\npresent, which belongs to the different formation epoch for\nthe both clusters. The relaxed system has already assembled, leading to higher metallicities at z=1.2. As metallicity is a measure of heavy elements to primordial the\nmerging system, building up by mergers introduces enriched ICM to the cluster region at all epochs, leading to\na slightly increase in the mean metallicity. Model cluster\nB is has nearly constant mean metallicities in the redshift regime z<1.2. The difference is given by the different\namount of primordial ICM mass accretion in the same\ninterval. Whereas the enrichment combinations a and b\ndeliver nearly the same results for model cluster A, there\nis a difference for model cluster B. In this case nearly all\nmetals are lost by galactic winds, as they are not suppressed by any physical process like pressure of the ICM\nonto the galaxies (Schindler et al. 2005).\nFig. 10 shows the evolution of the ICM mass within a\nsphere with a radius of 2 Mpc comoving around the cluster\ncentre.

Evolution of the ICM mass in a sphere with 2\nMpc radius around the cluster centre.\n\nfalling into the sphere, the main difference between model\ncluster A and B is the growth of mass between z=1.2 and\nz=0. Metals ejected at higher redshift and falling towards\nthe cluster centre have to mix with yet unpolluted gas, resulting in a decrease of metallicity in model cluster B. In\nmodel cluster A the amount of ICM in the same redshift\ninterval does not increase so much, despite during merger\nevents. Therefore the metals ejected by galactic winds and\nremoved by ram-pressure stripping do increase the overall\nmetallicity in the 500 kpc radius area around the cluster\ncentre. This slight increase is consistent with observations,\ne.g. Balestra et al. (2006). In the case of the massive model\ncluster B this seems not to be the case. Combining different clusters with different luminosities might explain this\ndiscrepancy.\nIn Fig. 11 observed metallicity profiles for six different\nnon-cooling flow clusters are shown. The data points are\ntaken from Pratt et al. (2006) (RXJ0003+0203, RXJ00202542, RXJ0547-3152, RXJ1516+0005 and RXJ2023-2056)\nand Hayakawa et al. (2006) (A1060), as they present noncooling flow clusters. A common striking feature for all\nmeasured radial metallicity profiles is a nearly flat distribution within a radius of 600 kpc around the cluster\ncentre. In contrast to cooling flow clusters, which show an\nenhancement of metallicities towards the cluster centre,\ne.g. De Grandi et al. (2004), non-cooling flow clusters have\ntypical mean metallicities in the order of 0.3 - 0.5 in solar\nabundance in the central region. We include in Fig. 11 the\nmetallicity profiles for model cluster A with both enrichment process combinations a and b, see e.g. Fig. ??. We\nare able to reproduce both the observed spatial distribution and the observed amount of metals when taking into\naccount both enrichment processes. Due to the limited numerical resolution, we are not able to follow the increase\nin the observed profiles in the very central (\u223c 50 kpc)\nregion of the clusters.

Discussion and conclusions\nWe investigate the efficiency of galactic winds and rampressure stripping in combined N-body/hydrodynamic\nsimulations of the intra-cluster medium with seminumerical galaxy modelling. The terminus mass loss in\nour simulations refers to galactic material, which is not\ngravitationally bound to a galaxy anymore. From the simulations we calculate X-ray weighted metallicity maps and\nprofiles as well as mass loss histories for the model cluster\ngalaxies. The profiles are compared with observations. A\nmajor uncertainty are the metallicities of the ejecta and\nstripped gas of the galaxies. This leads in our setup to\nhigher or lower overall metallicities in the ICM, but would\nnot affect the spatial distribution of metals in the ICM.\nGiven the model assumptions, we find the following\n1. We confirm the inhomogeneous distribution of heavy\nelements found in the intra-cluster medium.\n2. The mass loss due to galactic winds is half the mass\nloss caused by ram-pressure stripping in the case of\n\n\f10\n\nW. Kapferer et al.: Metal enrichment of the intra-cluster medium over a Hubble time\n\na merging galaxy cluster if ram-pressure stripping is\nallowed to suppress the outflow by galactic winds.\nIn the case of no influence of ram-pressure stripping\nonto galactic winds the mass loss by galactic winds\nis 80% of the mass loss by ram-pressure stripping. In\nthe case of a relaxed, massive system the mass loss by\nram-pressure stripping is three times higher than the\nmass loss by galactic winds if ram-pressure stripping\nsuppresses the outflow of galactic winds. In this case\nram-pressure stripping is the dominating enrichment\nprocess in cool-core galaxy clusters. If galactic winds\nare not affected by ram-pressure stripping the efficiency of both processes permute, leading to nearly\nno mass loss by ram-pressure stripping.\nFor merging galaxy clusters the number of galaxies\nlosing mass by ram-pressure stripping is nearly as\nhigh as in a relaxed system. This difference can be\nexplained by sub-cluster merger events, increasing the\ndensity of the ICM and the relative velocities of the\ngalaxies with respect to the ICM.\n3. Whereas galactic winds trigger most of the mass loss\nin the redshift regime z>2, ram-pressure stripping\nincreases the mass loss in the redshift interval z<2, in\nwhich the clusters start to form.\n4. We traced the evolution of the metallicity in the ICM\nand found an increase of the metallicity in a 1 Mpc\narea around the cluster centre in the redshift regime\nz<1.2 for the merging system. The relaxed, massive\ngalaxy cluster shows nearly a constant metallicity in\nthe same redshift regime. Unpolluted ICM entering\nthe cluster region and the different efficiency of the\nenrichment processes as a function of redshift explains\nthis behaviour. In the case of the merging system\nenrichment processes are relatively more efficient\nover all redshifts, leading to a slight increase for the\nmean metallicity. In the relaxed system ram-pressure\nstripping and galactic winds do not enrich unpolluted\nICM to such an amount, that the metallicity of the\nwhole cluster increases.\n5. Comparing the metallicity profiles of observed merging\nclusters with model clusters, we find good agreement\nin the spatial distribution of the metallicity for merging galaxy clusters. In the case of relaxed, massive\nsystems the slope of the observed metallicity profile\nis well reproduced in the central \u223c300 kpc, whereas\nbeyond \u223c300 kpc the observed profiles are shallower.\n6. A comparison of the metals lost by galactic winds and\nram-pressure stripping leads to the conclusion that at\nradii less than 500 kpc matter lost by ram-pressure\nstripping dominates the profiles, whereas in the outer\nregions galactic winds contribute to the same amount.\nIf galactic winds are not affected by ram-pressure\nstripping, galactic winds are more efficient over the\nwhole galaxy cluster in the case of a massive system.\n\nIf distinct metal blobs caused by galaxies with strong\ngalactic winds fall towards the cluster centre, humps\nin the metallicity profiles are visible (see Figs. 5, 6\nand 12).\n\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors are grateful to the anonymous referee\nfor his/her fruitful comments that helped to improve\nthe paper.
