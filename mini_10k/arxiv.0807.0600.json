These are important data, as the dijet system reaches masses Mjj\nof the order of 130 GeV, i.e. the region \u221a\nof mass where the Higgs boson is expected. Given\nthe high centre-of-mass energy involved, s \u226b Mjj , the process is entirely due to pomeron\nexchange. Thus the dijets are produced by the same physical mechanism which could produce\nthe Higgs boson and other rare particles. The CDF data provide a good opportunity to tune\nthe calculations of quasi-elastic diffractive processes which, as we shall show, are otherwise\nplagued with severe uncertainties.\nAlmost twenty years ago, Sch\u00e4fer, Nachtmann and Sch\u00f6pf [2] proposed the use of diffractive\nhadron-hadron collisions, where a high-mass central system is produced, as a way of producing\nthe Higgs boson. Bjorken recognised such quasi-elastic reactions, in which the protons do not\nbreak despite the appearance of the high-mass system, as a \"superb\" channel to produce exotic\nparticles [3]. The first evaluation was done in the Higgs case by Bialas and Landshoff [4]. It\nrelied heavily on the use of non-perturbative propagators for the gluons, which provide an\nautomatic cut-off of the infrared region. That calculation was then repeated by two of us [5],\nwhere we showed that by properly treating the proton form factors, one could use either\nperturbative or non-perturbative propagators. However, even with the use of form factors\nscreening the long wavelengths of the exchanged gluons, one remained sensitive to the infrared\nregion, as the gluons had a typical off-shellness of the order of 1 GeV. Berera and Collins [6]\nthen calculated the double-pomeron jet cross sections using a perturbative QCD framework.\nThey identified large absorptive corrections - corresponding to the \"gap survival probability\",\ni.e. to multiple pomeron exchanges - as well as large virtual corrections - coming from the\nlarge difference of scales at the jet vertex, and resulting in a \"Sudakov form factor\". However,\nthey did not model these corrections.\nSince then the subject of diffractive dijet and Higgs production has been extensively discussed from a variety of points of view [7]\u2013 [18]. All the calculations essentially follow the\nsame pattern; the variations come in the following four ingredients:\n1. The two jets are at low rapidity, and at high transverse energy ET . They then come\ndominantly from gluon production at large transverse momentum (which we shall note\nk2 ) and the partonic amplitude can be calculated in perturbative QCD. Furthermore,\nthe two outgoing gluons are constrained to be in a colour-singlet state, and, to prevent\ncolour flow in the t channel, an extra screening gluon is exchanged (Fig. 1.a). The exact\nrelation between the parton k2 and the jet ET will be discussed in Section 6.2.\n2. As the gluons go from low transverse momenta in the proton to high ones in the jet\nsystem, there are enhanced double logarithms from vertex corrections (Fig. 1.b), which\nmust be resummed to give the Sudakov form factor.\n3. The infrared divergences of the gluon propagators linked to the proton are regulated via\nthe use of an impact factor [5], as in Fig. 1.c, or of non-perturbative propagators [18],\nor via the Sudakov form factor linked to the hard scattering [8].\n\n1\n\n\f(1.a)\n\n(1.b)\n\n(1.c)\n\n(1.d)\n\nFigure 1: A sketch of the various steps of the calculation.\n4. Finally, it is possible that the two protons interact at long distances. This leads to\nscreening corrections, as sketched in Fig. 1.d, and to a gap survival probability given by\nthe average squared norm of the S-matrix element |hpp|S|ppi|2 [19, 20].\nIn this paper we want to evaluate, in view of the CDF data, the uncertainties in the various\ningredients of the calculation of central exclusive dijet production. As discussed above, ours\nis not the first such calculation, however we believe to shed light on several important points.\nWe show that the calculation still lies mostly in the non-perturbative region, and that many\nstandard approximations cannot be justified. In particular, we find the following:\n\u2022 At the Born level, exact transverse kinematics is important. That is to say, the momentum transfers to the hadrons cannot be neglected with respect to the momentum of the\nscreening gluon, which makes the exchange colour-neutral. In Section 1, we present a\ndetailed account of the part of the calculation which is under control, i.e. lowest-order\nqq \u2192 qqgg via a colour-singlet exchange. There we take the exact transverse kinematics\ninto account. Furthermore, diagrams in which the screening gluon participates in the\nhard sub-process cannot necessarily be neglected, as has been assumed in previous works.\nIn Section 2.3, we show they could be important once the Sudakov suppression is taken\ninto account. These issues affect the calculation of the partonic amplitudes mentioned\nabove in ingredient 1.\n\u2022 The leading and subleading logs that are resummed to give the Sudakov form factors\nare not dominant for the momentum range of the data, i.e. the constant terms are numerically important. This affects the calculation of double logarithm vertex corrections\nmentioned above in ingredient 2. We discuss the Sudakov form factor and the problems\nassociated with the large virtual corrections in Section 2.\n\u2022 The colour neutrality of the protons has to be implemented independently of the Sudakov suppression. This affects the calculations [8] that make use only of the Sudakov\n2\n\n\fp \u2212 k1\n\nq\n\nk1 \u2212 k2\nk2 \u2212 k3\n\np\n\np + k3\n\nFigure 2: Kinematic conventions for the central two-gluon production.\n\nform factor to regulate the infrared divergences of the gluon propagators mentioned in\ningredient 3. This is discussed in Section 3, where we consider various ways to embed\nthe perturbative calculation into a proton.\nIn addition to these points, there remains the issue of gap survival, ingredient 4 in the list\nabove. Providing an accurate numerical estimate of this is beyond the scope of this paper but\nwe do discuss the gap survival probability and current estimates in Section 4.\nIn view of the above uncertainties, we try to outline a few scenarios that do reproduce\nthe dijet data, and that can be extended to Higgs production at the LHC. After a few extra\ncorrections, we give in Section 5 a simple estimate of the cross section, followed in Section 6\nby detailed numerical results. Finally in Section 7 we present our conclusions.\n\n1\n1.1\n\nThe lowest-order perturbative QCD calculation\nKinematics\n\nThe backbone of the central quasi-elastic production of two high-ET jets is the partonic subprocess qq \u2192 qqgg, in which the produced colour-singlet two-gluon system is separated by\nlarge rapidity gaps from the two scattering quarks. The kinematic conventions are shown in\nFig. 2. We assume that the quarks are massless and consider the collision in a frame where\nthe incoming quarks have no transverse momenta. Their momenta q \u03bc and p\u03bc , with s \u2261 2p * q,\nwill be used as the lightcone vectors for the Sudakov decomposition of all other momenta entering the calculation. The momentum transfer to the first and second quarks are \u2212k1 and k3 ,\nrespectively, and are dominated by their transverse parts \u2212k1 and k3 (we write all transverse\nvectors in bold). The momenta of the two produced gluons are\nr1\u03bc = \u03b11 p\u03bc + \u03b21 q \u03bc + (k1 \u2212 k2 )\u03bc ,\nr2\u03bc = \u03b12 p\u03bc + \u03b22 q \u03bc + (k2 \u2212 k3 )\u03bc ,\n\n\u03b11 \u03b21 s = (k1 \u2212 k2 )2 ,\n\u03b12 \u03b22 s = (k2 \u2212 k3 )2 .\n\n(1)\n\nThe largest contribution to the cross section will come from the region where longitudinal\ncomponents obey\n1 \u226b \u03b21 , \u03b22 \u226b\n\nk2i\n,\ns\n\n1 \u226b \u03b12 , \u03b11 \u226b\n3\n\nk2i\n,\ns\n\ni = 1, 2, 3,\n\n(2)\n\n\fas the invariant mass squared of the two-gluon system\n2\nMgg\n\n[\u03b22 k1 + \u03b21 k3 \u2212 (\u03b21 + \u03b22 )k2 ]2\n= (r1 + r2 ) =\n\u03b21 \u03b22\n2\n\n(3)\n\nis much smaller than s. The differential cross section can then be written as a convolution\nover a phase space factorised between light-cone and transverse degrees of freedom:\nd\u03c3 =\n\n16s2\n\nd\u03b21 d\u03b22 2\n1\nd k1 d2 k2 d2 k3 * |M|2 .\n8\n(2\u03c0) \u03b21 \u03b22\n\nThe longitudinal phase space can alternatively be written as\np\nd\u03b21 d\u03b22\n\u03b21\nd\u03b2 dx\n=\n, where \u03b2 = \u03b21 \u03b22 and x =\n.\n\u03b21 \u03b22\n\u03b2 x\n\u03b22\n\n(4)\n\n(5)\n\nIf the two gluons are both integrated in the whole available phase space, then an extra 1/2\nshould be put in the expression of the cross section due to Bose statistics.\n\n1.2\n\nSimplifications for the imaginary part\n\nAs we shall see, the lowest-order calculation will lead to an amplitude which grows linearly\nwith s. As the exchange is C = +1, the amplitude is then mostly imaginary, and can be\ncalculated via their standard cuts. At the same lowest order, the real part is suppressed by a\npower of s, however it will be only logarithmically suppressed at higher orders. In principle, it\ncan be obtained via dispersion relations, but we do not concern ourselves with its contribution,\nas it will be much smaller than the large uncertainties in the other parts of the calculation.\nIn contrast to central Higgs production, two gluons can be emitted from all parts of the\ndiagrams in many different ways, which is represented by the grey circle of Fig. 2. However, if\none calculates the imaginary part of the amplitude, then there are multitudinous cancellations\namong different contributions due to the positive signature and colour-singlet nature of the\nexchange, as well as to the presence of large rapidity gaps. We show in Fig. 3 two typical\ncut diagrams that give rise to an imaginary part for n1 + n2 jet production. The dashed line\nrepresents the kinematic cut of the diagram, i.e. it indicates which propagators are put on\nshell in the loop integral. The contributions of the \"wrong cut\" such as, for example, those\nshown in Fig. 3.b cancel one another. This means that one can write the amplitude as a\nsequence of two sub-amplitudes, gauge invariant on their own: 2 \u2192 2 + n1 \u2192 (2 + n2 ) + n1 , as\nin Fig. 3.a. Since in our case n1 + n2 = 2, there are three generic situations: (n1 = 0, n2 = 2),\n(n1 = 2, n2 = 0), or (n1 = 1, n2 = 1).\nEach of the sub-amplitudes in Fig. 3.a describes the emission of one or two gluons in the\ncentral region. In principle, all the vertices needed for the calculation of two-gluon production in arbitrary kinematics can be found in the literature. Production of one gluon can be\ndescribed by the standard Lipatov vertex [21], while emission of two gluons involves an effective four-gluon vertex in the quasi-multi-Regge kinematics [22]. Such non-local vertices take\ninto account gluon emission not only from the t-channel gluons themselves, but also from the\nquarks. In the case of large transverse momentum of the produced gluons, which is the focus\nof the present paper, the situation simplifies, since emission from t-channel gluons is dominant,\nand the amplitude is more conveniently calculated using Feynman diagrams and cutting rules.\n4\n\n\fn1\n\nn1\nn2\n\nn2\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 3: Schematic representation of the imaginary part of the production amplitude of\nn1 + n2 gluons in the central region. s-channel cuts of the diagrams, such as (a) contribute to\nthe imaginary part, while \"wrong cuts\", such as (b), do not.\n\n1.3\n\nCentral production of two gluons with large transverse momentum\n\nWe are interested in the quasi-elastic production of two gluons with large relative transverse\nmomenta of the order of tens of GeV. The requirement that the protons remain intact effectively cuts the differential cross section at small values of momentum transfers, k21 , k23 <\n\u223c 1/Bp ,\nwhere Bp is a typical proton elastic slope in hadronic reactions (for more discussion on what\nnumerical value for Bp would be most appropriate in our case, see Section 3.3). Therefore,\nk21 , k23 \u226a k22 , and the process can be viewed as a collision of two nearly-collinear but energetic\ngluons5 g \u2217g \u2217 \u2192 gg accompanied by an additional exchange of an extra screening gluon to\nrestore the neutrality of the t-channel colour exchange. The set of diagrams to be considered\nis then reduced to those of Fig. 4, and to their counterparts where each gluon is emitted from\nthe other side of the cut.\nLowest-order diagrams with gluons emitted from different t-channel gluons, such as the\none of Fig. 4.b, are suppressed6 by one extra power of k22 . The situation may become different\nat higher orders, as we shall explain in Section 2.3. Also, as we are calculating cut diagrams,\nthe sub-amplitudes are at the tree level and there are no ghost contributions.\nThe Mandelstam invariants in the two-gluon collision can be written\n2\nMgg\n\u2261 sgg \u2248 k22\n\n(\u03b21 + \u03b22 )2\n,\n\u03b21 \u03b22\n\ntgg \u2248 \u2212k22\n\n\u03b21 + \u03b22\n,\n\u03b21\n\nugg \u2248 \u2212k22\n\n\u03b21 + \u03b22\n.\n\u03b22\n\n(6)\n\nNote that these invariants depend only on the ratio x = \u03b21 /\u03b22 , which is related to the difference\nof the rapidities of two produced gluons.\nLet us also introduce the momenta of the colliding gluons\n\u03ba\u03bc1 = (k + k1 )\u03bc ,\n\n\u03ba\u03bc3 = \u2212(k + k3 )\u03bc ,\n\n5\n\n(7)\n\nStrictly speaking, in the lab frame, one of these two gluons can be very soft and emitted at large angle\nrelative to the quark collision axis.

Strictly speaking,\nthe two colliding gluons are virtual. In our kinematics, their off-shellnesses are \u2212\u03ba21 and \u2212\u03ba23 ,\nwhich are much smaller than k22 . Since the hard scale of the scattering sub-process is given\nby k22 , one can neglect the non-zero virtualities and approximate the amplitude by gg \u2192 gg\nscattering of on-shell transversely polarised gluons, and neglect the contribution from the\nlongitudinal polarisations. The calculation is then manifestly gauge invariant.\nThe helicity amplitudes for the tree-level scattering of two gluons in a colour-singlet state\nare most easily calculated in the centre-of-mass frame:\n\u0012\n\u0013\nN\nsgg\nsgg\n2\nab c1 c2\nM\u03bb1 \u03bb2 \u2192\u03bb3 \u03bb4 = 2g 2\nei(\u03bb1 \u2212\u03bb2 )\u03c6 A(\u03bb1 \u03bb2 \u2192 \u03bb3 \u03bb4 ) ,\n(10)\n\u03b4 \u03b4\n+\nN \u22121\ntgg\nugg\nwhere \u03c6 is the azimuthal angle of the two-gluon-production plane with respect to the quantisation axis. Note that this quantisation axis is arbitrary, and changing it will produce changes\n(l)\u2217\nin M which will be compensated by opposite changes in j\u03bbi .\nThe fact that Eq. (10) is written in a frame which is different from the laboratory frame\ndoes not pose any problem. Indeed, in order to pass from the laboratory frame to the gg centreof-mass frame with gluons colliding along the z axis, one first has to perform a longitudinal\nboost to make the energies of the colliding gluons equal, then a transverse boost to make\n6\n\n\fthe total momentum of two gluons zero, and then rotate the frame to align the z axis with\nthe direction of the incoming gluons. The large longitudinal boost does not change \u03c6, while\nthe transverse boost and the rotation by a small angle have negligible effect on the hard\nmomentum k2 . Therefore, one can safely understand \u03c6 in Eq. (10) as the azimuthal angle in\nthe lab frame.\nThe non-zero A(\u03bb1 \u03bb2 \u2192 \u03bb3 \u03bb4 ) in Eq.

In our case it\nimplies, in particular, that ++ and \u2212\u2212 amplitudes do not interfere with any other.\nThe fact that the colliding gluons are soft, and the momentum hierarchy of Eq. (2), simplifies the calculation. Each of the polarisation vectors for the initial gluons can be chosen\northogonal to both \u03ba\u03bc1 and \u03ba\u03bc3 , and within our accuracy can be generically written as\n\u0014\n\u0015\n2 \u03bc e\u03bb * \u03ba1\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n\u03bc e\u03bb * \u03ba3\np\n+q\n,\n(11)\ne\u03bb = e\u03bb +\ns\n\u03b21 + \u03b22\n\u03b11 + \u03b12\nHere, e\u03bb is the standard polarisation vector in the transverse plane,\n1\ne\u03bb = \u2212 \u221a (\u03bb, i) ,\n2\nwith \u03bb = \u03bb1 for the first gluon and \u03bb = \u2212\u03bb2 for the second one, since they move in opposite\nlongitudinal directions.

This induces correlations between the colliding\n7\n\n\fgluons, and will lead in a moment to the conclusion that the fully unpolarised qq \u2192 qq + gg\ncross section integrated over all phase space is not proportional to the unpolarised gg \u2192 gg\ncross section.\nThe only non-trivial interference here is between M+\u2212\u2192f and M\u2212+\u2192f , with f = +\u2212 or \u2212+.\nSuch a term introduces an azimuthal dependence for high-|k2 | gluons via the factor exp(4i\u03c6).\nIt contributes to the azimuthal correlations between the high-ET jets and the proton scattering\nplanes, but if integrated over \u03c6 (still keeping the cross section differential in k22 ), this term\nvanishes.

This is the situation for which large doubly logarithmic corrections, \u223c log2 (k22 ),\nare expected, from virtual diagrams such as those of Fig. 5. These corrections are there for any\ngauge theory [24] and have been calculated in QCD in [25]. For initial gluons on-shell, these\ncorrections actually diverge, and this divergence is cancelled by the bremsstrahlung diagrams\nin inclusive cross sections. Hence, the cancellation of infrared divergences means that the\nlogarithmic structure of the virtual corrections is identical to that of the bremsstrahlung\ndiagrams7 .\nSo there are two interpretations of the Sudakov form factor. On the one hand, one can\nview it as a resummation of the double-log enhanced virtual corrections. For example, at\nthe one-loop order, these corrections include diagrams with the integrals over the fraction of\nthe light-cone momentum, z, and the transverse momentum, q2 , of the particle in the loop.\nEach of these integrals builds up a logarithm coming from regions \u2206 \u226a z and l2 \u226a q2 \u226a \u03bc2 ,\nrespectively. Here, \u2206 is a cut-off to be discussed below, l2 is a typical virtuality of the initial\n7\n\nFor the case at hand, the infrared region is cut off by the off-shellness of the initial gluon, so that the\nlogarithms are large, finite and of the order of log(sgg /(k1 + k)2 ) log(sgg /(k3 + k)2 ) \u2265 25 for the CDF exclusive\njet production.\n\n9\n\n\fgluons in the g \u2217 g \u2217 \u2192 gg process, and \u03bc is the scale of the hard process, which is of the order\nof the jet transverse energy ET .\nOn the other hand, the cancellation of logarithms between virtual and real diagrams means\nthat same Sudakov form factor can be reworded in a Monte-Carlo language as the probability of not emitting any extra partons. In this interpretation, one considers collision of two\ngluons and calculates the probabilities that a hard sub-process is accompanied by a certain\nnumber of secondary partons. Subtracting from unity all the probabilities of emission gives\nthe probability of the purely exclusive reaction.\nUsing this technique, one can then use for the Sudakov form factor the expression coming\nfrom Monte Carlo simulations [26]:\n2\n\n2\n\n\u0002\n\n2\n\n2\n\n\u0003\n\nT (\u03bc , l ) = exp \u2212S(\u03bc , l ) ,\n\n2\n\n2\n\nS(\u03bc , l ) =\n\nZ\n\n\u03bc2\nl2\n\ndq2 \u03b1s (q2 )\nq2 2\u03c0\n\nZ\n\n1\u2212\u2206\n\ndz [zPgg + Nf Pgq ] .

First, pure\nDGLAP kinematics leads to the cut-off \u2206 = q2 /\u03bc2 . Using this cut-off, one obtains the expression worked out in [25]. However, it can be argued that the coherent effects lead to angular\nordering in the successive splitting of the secondary partons [27]. This ordering introduces a\nmore restrictive limit on the z integral, which becomes linear in |q|: \u2206 = |q|/\u03bc. With this\ndefinition of \u2206, one obtains a double-log result, which is twice smaller than in [25]:\n\u0012 2\u0013\n3\u03b1s\n\u03bc\n2\n2 2\nSDLA (\u03bc , l ) =\nlog\n.\n(22)\n4\u03c0\nl2\nNumerically, this change is very substantial; it can easily lead to factors O(10) in the cross\nsection. In the following, we shall only use the latter prescription for \u2206. Note that, together\nwith formula (19), it can also be derived from the CCFM equation [28].\nSeveral comments are in order. First of all, Eq. (19) does not include all the single logarithms present in the process, which, to the best of our knowledge, have been evaluated only\nfor the quark vertex [29]. One does not know in the present case whether further singlelogarithmic corrections are large, or whether they break the exponentiation. Moreover,even\nif one takes Eq. (19) at face value, its validity depends on the fact that the logarithms are\n10\n\n\f2\n\n2\n\nlog terms\n2\nlog + log terms\nConstant terms\n\nS (100 GeV2 ,`2 )\n\n1.5\n\n1\n\n0.5\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n` [GeV\u2104\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\n3.5\n\n4\n\nFigure 6: The contribution of the various terms entering the argument of the Sudakov form\nfactor.\n\ndominant. We show in Fig. 6 the contribution to S of the constant terms, compared to that of\nlogarithms, for \u03bc = 10 GeV. For typical scales relevant for the CDF measurements (\u03bc \u223c O(10\nGeV), l \u2248 1 GeV) the single-log corrections are large. They are negative for Pgg and positive\nfor Pqg . One can even say that the overall contribution of g \u2192 q q\u0304 splitting is equally important\nas g \u2192 gg. As we explained above, these logarithmic corrections are only an educated guess,\nand the fact that they are huge makes the theoretical predictions unstable.\nFurthermore, as can also be seen from Fig. 6, it turns out that even the constant terms in\n(19) are numerically important. One sees that, for an upper scale of 10 GeV, the logarithms are\ndominant only for l \u226a 2.5 GeV, which means that we can trust the perturbative formula (19)\nonly in the non-perturbative region!\nOur analysis implies that any other source of single-log contributions (for example, the one\ndiscussed in Section 2.3 below, or a mere shift of the upper and lower scales in the logarithm) is\nalso expected to affect strongly the resulting value of the Sudakov form factor. In Section 6.3\nwe will study this sensitivity in detail.\n\n2.2\n\nWhat is the upper scale in the Sudakov integral?\n\nThe standard discussion of the Sudakov form factors relies almost exclusively on corrections\nto the quark electromagnetic form factor. In this case, the hard vertex is characterised by the\nsingle kinematical quantity sqq\u0304 . In the Monte Carlo language, this energy defines the phase\nspace available for the secondary parton emission which needs to be suppressed. This is why\nthe upper scale in the Sudakov integral can be taken as \u03bc2 = c * sqq\u0304 , with numerical coefficient\nc = O(1).\nThe same argument applies to the Higgs central exclusive production. In this case, the\nhard vertex is effectively point-like, as the transverse momenta and virtualities of the top\n11\n\n\fquarks inside the loop are larger or of the order of the Higgs mass.\nWith dijets with large invariant mass, we enter a new kinematical regime. The two gluons\ncan have large invariant mass sgg both via large transverse momentum or via strong longitudinal ordering, see (3). In the former case, the transverse momentum exchange in the gg \u2192 gg\nscattering is large, k22 \u223c sgg , while in the latter case, k22 \u226a sgg .\nA typical double-log-enhanced correction to some vertex V gets one logarithm from the\nfraction of the lightcone variable and another one from the transverse momentum or virtuality\nintegral. In order for the transverse momentum integral to produce a sizable log, there should\nexist a large transverse momentum or large virtuality inside the effective vertex. In this case\nthe transverse momentum in the loop, when flowing through V does not change its amplitude.\nIn the Monte Carlo language, in order for the backwards evolution to develop, one must\nhave a large initial hard virtuality inside the vertex. On the contrary, if the vertex does not\ninvolve any large transverse momentum or large virtuality, then the transverse loop integral\nis suppressed by the vertex V , and the transverse logarithm does not build up. Once the\nstructure of the vertex V is resolved by the incoming gluons, the structure of the amplitude\nchanges, and double logarithms disappear. Because this transition is not sharp, the actual\nvalue of the upper scale is somewhat uncertain, but it must be of the order of k22 .\nThis can be immediately seen in the extreme case of production of two gluons in multiRegge kinematics (and therefore large sgg ) but with small transverse momenta, of the order\nof typical loop transverse momentum in the BFKL ladder. The amplitude of the gg \u2192 gg\nsubprocess is then \u221d sgg /tgg , and this process does not involve any hard gluon. Consider\nnow a loop correction to it. If the loop integral involves large transverse momentum q, then\nit will flow through the \"original\" gg \u2192 gg subprocess and will suppress its amplitude to\n\u221d sgg /q2 . This suppression prevents the development of the transverse momentum logarithm,\nin accordance with the general BFKL theory. It is in this suppression of the vertex where the\nkey difference lies between the usual Sudakov correction to the quark electromagnetic form\nfactor with its point-like vertex (or the Higgs production) and the dijet production.\nWith this discussion in mind, we believe that the physically motivated choice for the upper\nscale in the Sudakov integral should be related with the transverse momentum transfer in the\ngg \u2192 gg subprocess, but not with sgg .\nAs for the present study, with dijets produced in the central rapidity region and not in\nmulti-Regge kinematics, these two prescriptions do not lead to any major difference in the\n2\nET, min distribution of the cross section. However, they will lead to vastly different Mjj\nshapes\nof the cross section, which will be discussed in Section 6.2.\n\n2.3\n\nThe role of the screening gluon\n\nIt is usually assumed that the extra gluon in the t-channel is needed only to screen the colour\nexchange and does not participate in the hard sub-process, Fig. 4.a. So the pomeron fusion\nis very similar to gluon fusion (up to colour factors), and the details of the final state of the\nhard interaction do not substantially change the calculation. This would make dijet exclusive\nproduction essentially identical to Higgs exclusive production, and leads to the hope that the\nCDF data can be used to calibrate Higgs production. At the lowest order, this assumption is\njustified, since the emission of two gluons from two different t-channel legs, Fig. 4.b, leads to\n12\n\n\fFigure 7: At the Born level, (a), the diagram with two gluons emitted from different legs\ninvolves hard momentum flow in the t-channel, represented by thick gluon lines. As a result,\nthe one-loop corrections, (b), are never double-log enhanced. However, they \"localise\" the\nhard momentum flow in the diagram, and successive loop corrections are now double-log\nenhanced. Their calculation amounts to calculation of a novel type of Sudakov form factor to\nthe irreducible gggg \u2192 gg process, (c).\nan extra 1/k22 suppression.\nThe virtual corrections discussed so far in connection with the Sudakov form factor do not\nlead to any non-trivial \"cross-talk\" between the two t-channel gluons. Besides, the standard\nBFKL-type exchanges can be re-absorbed in the evolution of the gluon density, as we shall see\nin the next section, so that the screening gluon effectively decouples from the hard sub-process.\nHere, we would like to discuss two potential mechanisms through which the screening gluon\nmay get involved in the dynamics.\nThe first one is specific to dijet production. We know that the Born-level amplitude of\nthe standard diagram Fig. 4.a must be corrected by a Sudakov form factor. Keeping only the\nleading powers of the transverse momenta, we can write\nZ\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u0002\n\u0003\n1\nd2 k 2\n1 1\n2\n2\n2\n2\nImM \u223c 2\nk\nexp\n\u2212S(k\n,\nk\n)\n\u223c\nexp\n\u2212S(k\n,\nhk\ni)\n,\n(23)\n2\n2\n2\nk2\n(k2 )3\nk2 hk2 i\n\nwhere hk2 i \u2248 O(1 GeV2 ) is the position of the saddle point.\nLet us now consider similar corrections to the suppressed diagram of Fig. 4.b, the hard\npart of which is shown in Fig. 7.a. At the one-loop level, corrections to these diagrams are\nnot double-log enhanced8 . One can however channel the hard transverse momentum flow as\nshown in Fig. 7.b. This \u03b1S correction is enhanced by a single log. After that, however, the\nlines corresponding to the hard process remain the same at higher orders, and the outer gluon\nlegs do not carry any hard momentum, see Fig. 7.c. Thus, successive loops do produce doublelog corrections to the irreducible gggg \u2192 gg vertex, and, perhaps, may even be resummed,\nleading to a novel type of Sudakov form factor, the calculation of which might be interesting\n8\n\nk12\n\nWe remind the reader of the QED result for the Sudakov form factor in q q\u0304 collision with quark virtualities\nand k22 and total momentum q, [24, 30]:\nS=\n\n\u03b1\nq2\nq2\nlog 2 log 2 .\n2\u03c0\nk1\nk2\n\nIn a very asymmetric case, with p21 \u226a q 2 and p22 \u223c q 2 , this expression is only single-log enhanced.\n\n13\n\n\ff\n\n(a)\n\nf\n\n(b)\n\nf\n\n(c)\n\nFigure 8: A colourless final state f can be produced not only via the standard diagram (a)\nbut also via a collision of two gluons produced in multi-Regge-kinematics, (b) and (c). The\ndiagram (b) is the first term in the Sudakov form factor, while diagram (c) is specific for\ncentral exclusive production and modifies this form factor in the subleading logarithms. Note\nthat the hard process is totally concentrated in the blob and that no gluon line carries large\ntransverse momentum.\non its own. However, we stress that the corrections to the lowest-order result always lack one\nlogarithm, as they are of order \u03b1S log(k22 ) (\u03b1S log2 (k22 ))n .\nArguably, this is an indication that the corresponding factor that accompanies the Bornlevel amplitude, which we write as exp[\u2212Snew (k22 , k2 )], is not as small as the Sudakov form\nfactor: it might be that Snew (k22 , k2 ) \u226a S(k22 , k2 ). A very rough estimate of the resulting\namplitude is (see derivation in Appendix A)\nZ 2\n\u0002\n\u0003\n1\ndk\nImMnew \u223c 2 2\nexp \u2212Snew (k22 , k2 ) .\n(24)\n2\n(k2 )\nk\n\nNote that in contrast to the \"standard\" amplitude (23), the integrand here extends to much\nhigher values of k2 . Therefore, it might happen that, after all, the diagram Fig. 4.b is not\nas much suppressed as it looks at the Born-level. Certainly, for a very hard process, i.e. for\nk22 \u2192 \u221e, it can be safely neglected. However, its importance grows at smaller ET , and it is\nnot obvious without a detailed calculation from what values of ET the estimates from Eq. (23)\nand Eq. (24) become of the same order, and whether this interval includes the CDF kinematic\nregion. As the t-channel gluons are in a colour-singlet state, the diagrams of Figs. 4a and b\nhave opposite signs, so that the overall effect will be to decrease the jet cross section w.r.t.\nthe Higgs or \u03b3\u03b3 production cross sections.\nThe above corrections are specific to the dijets and are absent for Higgs or \u03b3\u03b3 production.\nLet us now discuss another potential correction that affects all of these final states (which we\ndenote generically f ) and, even more importantly, which is not suppressed by a power of the\nhard scale as was (24).\nIf a process gg \u2192 f is possible, then one can produce f not only via the standard mechanism, Fig. 8.a, but also via processes Fig. 8.b and Fig. 8.c. Note that none of the gluons\nshown in these diagrams carries hard transverse momentum of order ET . Diagrams Fig. 8.b\nand Fig. 8.c possess an extra \u03b1s but are enhanced by at least one large logarithm. More specifically, diagram Fig. 8.b is double-log enhanced and is effectively taken into account by the\n14\n\n\fSudakov form factor. However, the standard Sudakov form factor (the one used in inclusive\nproduction of a colourless state) does not include diagrams like Fig. 8.c, which are specific for\nthe central exclusive production.\nWe stress that the contribution of this diagram is not small, as it is single-log enhanced (see\nAppendix B). Therefore, such diagrams must be resummed, and they will lead to modifications\nto the Sudakov form factor at the single-log level, that were absent in the inclusive case.\nRecalling the very substantial role of single-log effects in the Sudakov form factor, one might\nexpect numerically very sizable corrections due to the diagrams like Fig. 8.c. Further analysis\nis definitely needed to bring these corrections under control.\n\n3\n3.1\n\nEmbedding the gluon production into proton-proton\ncollisions\nImpact factors\n\nSo far, we have considered colour-singlet quark-quark scattering, and expression (18) is singular\n\u20322\nwhen the exchanged gluons go on-shell, i.e. k2 \u03ba21 \u03ba23 k\u20322 \u03ba\u20322\n1 \u03ba3 \u2192 0. It has been argued [8] that\nthis divergence could be regularised via the Sudakov form factor, provided one chooses the\nsmallest gluon momentum as a lower bound for the q2 integral in (19). This is in general\nnot sufficient, as the same diagrams lead to a contribution to the inclusive jet production\ncross section, which will not contain any Sudakov form factor, but must be finite nevertheless.\nFurthermore, is well-known [31] that the Sudakov form factor is not required to regularise the\ndivergence: indeed, gluons with a long wavelength \u03bb average the colour of the proton, and\nhence a suppression proportional to rc /\u03bb must always be present when coupling to a colour\nsinglet of size rc . This is usually taken into account via the introduction of an impact factor\n\u03a6(ka , kb ) such that\n\u03a6(0, kb ) = \u03a6(ka , 0) = 0 .\n(25)\nHere ka and kb are the transverse momenta of the two t-channel gluons that couple to the\nproton. The differential cross section for two-gluon production in proton-proton scattering\ncan then be represented as\n\u0015 \u0014q\n\u0015\nY \u0014q\n\u2032\n\u2032\n2\n2\n2\n\u20322\nT (k2 , \u03bai )\u03a6(k, \u2212\u03bai )\nT (k2 , \u03bai )\u03a6(k , \u2212\u03bai ) .\nd\u03c3pp = d\u03c3qq \u2297\n(26)\ni=1,3\n\nThe symbol\nindicates that the factors are to be introduced inside the loop momentum\nR 2\u2297 here\n2 \u2032\nintegrals d k d k .\nThe presence of the impact factors removes all the infrared singularities present in the\n4\n8\npartonic-level expressions. Let us also note that g 12 in (18) should be understood as ghard\ngsof\nt,\nwhere ghard is a hard coupling coming from gluon-gluon collision, while gsof t is the coupling\nat the gluon-proton vertex.\nNote that when linking hadronic and partonic cross sections as in (26), we do not need\nto worry about the flux factors and the phase space. In principle, one could write the cross\nsection for proton-antiproton scattering from the start, which would be expressed in terms of\n15\n\n\fthe hadronic fluxes and phase space, and then work out the two-gluon production amplitude\nin the proton-antiproton collision. The net result would consist in the replacement of s by sp\u0304p\nboth in the flux/phase space and in the amplitude, and since the lowest order cross section\nis independent of the energy, these changes would cancel each other. This is consistent with\nthe fact that the partonic lowest-order cross section (18) depends on the momentum fractions\n\u03b21 and \u03b22 only via there ratio x = \u03b21 /\u03b22 , so that \u03b2i can be taken either with respect to the\nquark or to the (anti)proton.\nThis situation changes beyond the lowest order. In particular, we shall introduce below the\nunintegrated gluon density of the (anti)proton that depends on the fraction of the hadronic\nmomentum carried by the gluon. Therefore, from now on, we shall understand the fractions\n\u03b2i and \u03b1i with respect to the hadrons, i.e. as if the decomposition (1) involved the hadronic\nmomenta P \u03bc and Q\u03bc , rather than the partonic momenta p\u03bc and q \u03bc .\n\n3.2\n\nForm factors from a quark model\n\nThe simplest approach to the quark form factors is to consider that the ultra-relativistic proton\nis dominated by a 3-quark Fock state [32, 33]. One can then derive the form factors in terms\nof the quark light-cone wave function, and show that the form factor corresponding to the\ntwo gluons of momenta ka , kb coupling to the same quark is identical to the measured Dirac\nhelicity-conserving form factor F1 ((ka + kb )2 ). The contribution of the couplings to different\nquarks can then be parametrised as F1 (k2a + k2b + cka * kb ):\n\u0002\n\u0001\u0003\n\u03a6(ka , kb ) = 3 F1 ((ka + kb )2 ) \u2212 F1 k2a + k2b + cka * kb ,\n(27)\nThis makes the jet production finite. An s dependence can be easily introduced, provided one\nassumes that a simple-pole pomeron, of intercept \u03b10 and slope \u03b1\u2032 , is a good approximation.\nOne then has to multiply the form factor \u03a6 by the Regge factor [4]\n\u2032\n\nRjets = 1/\u03bei\u03b10 +\u03b1 t\n\n(28)\n\nwith t the total momentum carried by the two gluons, and \u03bei the longitudinal momentum\nlosses of the proton or of the antiproton, in our case \u03b21 + \u03b22 or \u03b11 + \u03b12 .\nThe coefficient c can then be fixed, as well as the soft coupling gsof t , so that one reproduces\nsoft data such as the total cross section and the total elastic cross section, for which the Regge\nfactor has to be changed to\nRsof t = \u03b1\u2032 s\n\n\u03b10 +\u03b1\u2032 t\n2\n\n.\n\n(29)\n\nFor the CDF cuts, one has \u03bei \u223c 0.01, so that the Regge factor of the jet cross section is\ncomparable to that of elastic scattering at 50 GeV. The t-slope of the exchange is thus of the\norder of 4 to 5 GeV\u22122 .\nThe two main disadvantages of this method come from the fact that, even if simple-pole\nexchanges dominate the soft amplitudes up to the Tevatron energy, they will receive nonnegligible corrections at LHC energies. Furthermore, the use of perturbative 2-gluon exchange\nto reproduce elastic cross sections does not work, in the sense that it produces a very large\ncurvature for d\u03c3/dt. So the normalisation of c and gsof t in this approach is at best tentative.\nIt may thus make sense to use DIS data to normalise the impact factors. This is precisely\nthe idea behind the use of unintegrated gluon densities in this calculation.\n16\n\n\f3.3\n\nUnintegrated gluon density\n\nThe distribution of gluons inside an ultra-relativistic proton can be modelled in a diagonal\nprocess by replacing the Born-level impact factor of the quark model with an unintegrated\ngluon density [34]:\ng2\n(30)\nCF 2 \u03a6(k, \u2212k) \u2261 FBorn (xg , k) \u2192 F (xg , k) .\n4\u03c0\nIn numerical calculations we used parametrisations of the unintegrated gluon density developed\nin [34, 35]. These parametrisations were obtained by fitting, in a kt -factorisation approach, the\nproton structure function F2p to the HERA data in the region of photon virtuality 0 < Q2 < 35\nGeV2 and for Bjorken-x smaller than 10\u22122 . Although the kt -factorisation approach is designed\nmostly to work in the region of small x and moderate Q2 , it was verified that the inclusion of a\nvalence quark contribution extended these fits of F2p data to a much broader kinematic region,\nfor Q2 up to 800 GeV2 and for x up to \u223c 0.5. These fits, without any readjustment, were also\nc\nfound to give a good description of the charm contribution to F2p , F2p\n, of the longitudinal\nstructure function, FL , as well as of diffractive vector meson production [35, 36]. This serves\nas an important cross-check of the universality of the unintegrated distributions.\nThese fits of F (xg , k) were constructed as sums of two terms, a hard part and a soft\npart, with a smooth interpolation between them. The hard component describes the effects of\nhard perturbative gluon exchange, and therefore is based on direct differentiation of conventional gluon densities (for which LO fits by GRV[38], MRS[39], and CTEQ[40] were used) and\nsmoothing out the saw-like behaviour of the result. The soft part describes soft colour-singlet\nexchange in the non-perturbative regime, and is constructed in a phenomenological way inspired by the dipole form factor. We stress that in the soft regime the term \"unintegrated\ngluon density\" must be understood simply as the Fourier transform of the colour dipole cross\nsection.\nOne also should not forget that at small x there is no strong hierarchy among successive\ngluons in a t-channel gluon ladder, which implies that the boundary between soft and hard\ninteractions becomes very smooth. For example, because of this soft-to-hard diffusion, the\nrobust feature of all the parametrisations obtained in [34, 35] was that at x \u223c 10\u22122, the structure function F2p received dominant contributions from the soft part for photon virtualities\nup to Q2 \u223c 10 GeV2 . Since the process we consider in this paper also takes place at small\nxg , this brings further concerns on the validity of the often-cited statement that the central\nexclusive diffractive production is in the perturbative regime and is well under control.\nOne of the manifestations of the soft dominance in this kinematic region is the observation\nthat exponent \u03bb which controls the energy growth of the integrated gluon density (often called\nthe effective Pomeron intercept) calculated within these fits is significantly smaller than the\none calculated directly from the conventional gluon densities. At typical gluon transverse\nmomenta of 1\u20132 GeV2 , we find \u03bb \u223c 0.1 \u2212 0.2, instead of 0.3 \u2212 0.4, as obtained from the\nconventional gluon densities. This is expected since the standard DGLAP approximation\ndoes not take into account new portions of the phase space that open up at small x, and\ninstead attributes an artificially fast growth rate to the gluon density itself.\nThe structure function F2p allows one to obtain the fits of the forward unintegrated\ngluon density, while the process we study here contains skewed unintegrated gluon densi17\n\n\fties at non-zero momentum transfer F (x1 , x2 , ka , kb ). We construct the latter in the following\nway. The effect of skewness is effectively taken into account by assuming that, for x1 \u226a x2 ,\nF (x1 , x2 , ka , kb ) behaves as the forward density taken at xg = 0.41x2 . In our case, x2 = \u03b21 +\u03b22\nfor the upper and x2 = \u03b11 + \u03b12 for the lower proton. The coefficient 0.41 effectively takes into\naccount the skewness factor, introduced in [41] and used in [8]. Numerically, this correction\namounts to a factor 0.41\u22124\u03bb \u2248 1.24 \u2248 2. Calculation of this factor using the conventional\ngluon densities would give a much larger value, 1.44 \u2248 4.\nThe non-zero transverse momentum transfer was introduced via a universal exponential\nfactor constructed in such a way that it respects conditions (25) and takes shrinkage into\naccount, similarly to [35, 36]. For example, the full expression for the upper proton used in\nour calculations reads:\n\u0013\n\u0012\nk2 + \u03ba21\nF (x1 , x2 , k, \u03ba1 ) = F 0.41(\u03b21 + \u03b22 ),\n2\n\u001a\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013 \u0015\u001b\n2 2\n1\nx0\n2k \u03ba1\n\u2032\n,\n(31)\nexp \u2212 B0 + 2\u03b1 log\nk21\n\u00d7 4\nk + \u03ba41\n2\n\u03b21 + \u03b22\nwith B0 = 4 GeV\u22122 , \u03b1\u2032 = 0.25 GeV\u22122 and x0 = 3.4 * 10\u22124 . With these values of the diffractive\ncone parameters, the slope of the k21 distribution d\u03c3/dk21 \u221d exp(\u2212Bp k21 ) is approximately\nequal to Bp \u2248 4 GeV\u22122 . This is significantly smaller than the slope in the elastic pp\u0304 collision\nat the Tevatron energy,\nd\u03c3pp (el.)\n\u221d exp(\u22122Bel |t|) ,\nd|t|\n\nBel \u2248 8.5 GeV\u22122 .\n\nIn our opinion, the choice Bp \u2248 4 GeV\u22122 is more natural than Bp \u2248 Bel since the elastic\nscattering at the Tevatron energy probes gluon distribution at x \u223c 10\u22127 , while in our process\nthe energetic gluons carry \u223c 10\u22122 of the proton momenta. However we stress that this choice\nis model dependent, and it introduces an extra uncertainty into theoretical calculation of the\ncentral production cross sections.\nFinally, note that we incorporate the unintegrated gluon density and the Sudakov form factor as independent factors. It might be argued [28, 42] that a more correct procedure would\nbe to define the unintegrated gluon density via a derivative of conventional gluon density\ntimes the square root of the Sudakov form factor. Either way one obtains only a convenient\nparametrisation of the true unintegrated gluon distribution function. The only essential requirement is that the same prescription be used for all the processes. We believe that the way\nour fits were constructed in [34] and are implemented here, this requirement is satisfied.\n\n4\n\nGap survival\n\nThere is one final aspect that has to be tackled to finish the calculation, and it has to do with\ngap survival probability. This concept was introduced by Bjorken a long time ago [3], and has\nbeen recently investigated in detail in [20]. We remind the reader of the main argument. As\nshown in Fig. 1, the process that we have calculated at the proton level may still have to be\ncorrected for initial and final-state interactions. The argument is that, due to the fact that\n18\n\n\fthe hard interaction occurs at short distance, and does not change the quantum numbers of\nthe protons, it does not influence the rescatterings. Of course, these can change the transverse\nmomenta of the protons, and one would have to convolute the hard scattering with the multiple\nexchanges. However, these correlations disappear once one works in impact parameter space,\nso that the total interaction probability can be thought of as the product of the hard scattering\nprobability multiplied by the probability for the two protons to go through each other, i.e.\nthe S matrix element squared |S(b)|2 = |hpp|S|ppi|2. It is easy to work out the square of\nthe absolute value of this correction from the expressions of the total and of the elastic cross\nsections.\nStarting with\nd\u03c3\n1\n=\n|a(s, t)|2\n(32)\n2\ndt\n16\u03c0s\none can use the usual definition of S\nS(b) = 1 + ia(s, b)\nto get the partial wave\na(s, b) =\nwhich leads to the expressions\n\nZ\n\nd2 \u2206 a(s, t)\n(2\u03c0)2 2s\n\nZ\n\n\u03c3tot = 2 d2 b Im a(s, b),\nZ\n\u03c3el =\nd2 b |a(s, b)|2 .\n\n(33)\n\n(34)\n\n(35)\n(36)\n\nThe square of the S-matrix density is then the square of the deviation of a(s, b) from i [19, 20]:\n|S(b)|2 = |i \u2212 a|2\n\n(37)\n\nHence any fit of the differential elastic cross section can be used to estimate the gap survival\nprobability. Generically, the gap survival will tend to 1 at large b and be suppressed at small\nb. All present models agree on the fact that, at the Tevatron, the elastic amplitude approaches\nthe black-disk limit a(s, b) = i for small b.\nThe simplest fit of the elastic cross section comes from CDF, who fit their data to [43]\nd\u03c3\n= N exp (2Bel t)\ndt\n\n(38)\n\nwith N = 334.6 \u00b1 18.8 mb GeV\u22122 and 2Bel = 16.98 \u00b1 0.24 GeV\u22122 . From this, one can get an\nestimate of the gap survival probability, by assuming that the amplitude is purely imaginary.\nOne then gets\nr\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\nN\nb2\nb2\ni\n= i(0.974 \u00b1 0.042) exp \u2212\n(39)\nexp \u2212\na(s, b) \u2248\n2Bp \u03c0\n4Bel\n4Bel\n19\n\n\fClearly, this is very close to the black-disk limit at b = 0. So one may expect a substantial\nsuppression of the cross section due to screening corrections. If the cross section is at really\nshort distance, then the average gap survival would be around |S(0)|2, i.e. less than 0.5 %.\nFortunately, this estimate is overly pessimistic as the cross section is not concentrated at\nvery short distance. Moreover, our estimate (39) gives only a lower bound, the amplitude has\na real part, and also as the measurements of the E811 collaboration [44] suggest one may be\nfurther from the black disk limit. Furthermore, although the differential cross section is close\nto an exponential near t = 0, it has another structure at higher t. Putting all these ingredients\ntogether is beyond the scope of this paper. Let us simply mention that several estimates are\npresent in the literature [45], and that most of them range from 5% to 15% at the Tevatron,\nand about a factor 2 lower at the LHC.\nWe want however to point out a few problems with the standard calculations of gap\nsurvival:\n\u2022 the conjugate variable of b is k1 + k3 , the relative momentum of p and p\u0304. This is a\ncombination of soft momenta, and folding in the gap survival (which is small at small b)\nwill further shift these momenta to the long-distance region. It is then very unlikely that\nthe screening corrections will be given by the simple gap survival formalism. In fact the\nscreening corrections will probably have a smaller effect, as they do not suppress truly\nsoft cross sections very much at the Tevatron.\n\u2022 most estimates [45] assume that the k1 and k3 dependences factorise. This makes the\ncalculation of the gap survival quite simple. However, because of the k and k\u2032 integrations, this is not true in our case. Given the large uncertainties in the gap survival, this\nmay not be a crucial issue.\n\n5\n5.1\n\nRough Estimate of the Cross Section\nBare cross section\n\nBefore presenting detailed numerical results, we find it useful to make some simple order-ofmagnitude estimates.\nLet us start by estimating the bare cross section at the hadronic level, i.e. by keeping\nthe proton form factors but omitting the Sudakov form factor altogether. Consider again the\ncross sections (18), (26). Since the strongest dependence on the k1 and k3 comes from the\nproton form factors, it is reasonable to take \u03ba1 \u2248 \u03ba3 \u2248 k and \u03ba\u20321 \u2248 \u03ba\u20323 \u2248 k\u2032 in the numerator.\nAssuming the correlation between k and k\u2032 to be weak, one can neglect the total helicity 2\namplitudes, so that the cross section simplifies to\nd\u03c3 =\n\n1 dk22 d\u03b2 dx 2 4\n\u03b1h \u03b1sof t h\u03a64 i.\n2 2\n9\u03c0 (k2 ) \u03b2 x\n\n(40)\n\n2\nwith \u03b1hard = ghard\n/4\u03c0 and correspondingly for \u03b1sof t . We introduced here a dimensionless\nquantity\n\u0014Z 2\n\u00152\nZ\n1\nd k \u03a6(k, \u2212k \u2212 k1 )\u03a6(\u2212k, k + k3 )\n4\n2\n2\nh\u03a6 i \u2261 4 d k1 d k3\n.\n(41)\n\u03c0\n(k + k1 )2 (k + k3 )2\n\n20\n\n\fNote that the x-integration in (40) spans over the x \u2265 1 region, which allows us not to include\nthe 1/2 factor due to the Bose statistics of gluons.

Then, one has\n4\nto estimate h\u03a6 i, which is an intrinsically soft quantity.

It indicates that the Sudakov\nsuppression indeed plays a crucial role in this process.\nThe Sudakov form factor enters the loop integral, and it reshapes the k2 regions that\ncontribute most to the amplitude. Before the introduction of the Sudakov form factor, the\n21\n\n\floop was dominated by the soft momenta due to 1/k4 factor. Now, the weight of the soft\nmomenta is suppressed in Eq. (46):\nZ\ndk2 2\n2 2\n\u03a6 (k, \u2212k)e\u2212S(k2 ,k ) .\n(49)\nJ =\n4\nk\nAs a result, the dominant k2 -region shifts towards harder scales. Using the saddle point\napproximation, it has been estimated [8] that the dominant region is at |k| \u2248 1\u20132 GeV. It is\noften claimed that this makes the loop sufficiently hard to justify the applicability of pQCD\nand the usage of perturbative fits to the gluon density.\nHere, we discuss this issue in some detail. With two simple estimates, we will show below\nthat the overall suppression and the |k| shift depend strongly on the details of the Sudakov\nform factor.\nLet us switch to a more convenient variable x = log(k2 /\u039b2 ), where \u039b = \u039bQCD and rewrite\n(49) as\nZ\n1\ndx e\u2212I(x) , I(x) = x \u2212 2 log \u03a6(x) + S(x2 , x) ,\n(50)\n\u039b2\n\nwhere x2 \u2261 log(k22 /\u039b2 ).\nIn the first approximation, the proton form factor \u03a6 plays the role of the infrared cut-off of\nthe above integral: x >\n\u223c 0. Therefore, without the Sudakov form factor altogether, the integral\nin (50) is of order one.\nNow, let us take the Sudakov form factor in the double-log approximation (22) with the\nfixed \u03b1S (k22 ). Then,\n3\n(x2 \u2212 x)2 ,\n(51)\nI(x) = x +\n\u03b20 x2\nand the position of the saddle point x0 is at x0 = x2 (1 \u2212 \u03b20 /6) < 0, i.e. the integral is still\nsaturated in the soft region. The estimate of the suppression factor is then\nZ \u221e\nexp [\u22123x2 /\u03b20 ]\ndx exp [\u2212I(0) \u2212 I \u2032 (0) x] =\n,\n1 \u2212 \u03b260\n0\nwhich is about 0.2 for k2 = 10 GeV. If, instead, we take a running \u03b1S (k2 ), then in the same\ndouble-log approximation\n\u0011\n6 \u0010\nx2\nI(x) = x +\nx2 log\n\u2212 x2 + x ,\n(52)\n\u03b20\nx\nwhich gives now\nx0 =\n\nx2\n,\n1 + \u03b260\n\nwhich now makes typical k2 \u223c 1 GeV. The integral then becomes\ns\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0012\n6x2\n\u03b20\n\u03c0\u03b20 x2\n,\nexp \u2212\nlog 1 +\n\u03b20\n6\n3(1 + \u03b260 )2\n22\n\n(53)\n\n(54)\n\n\fwhich is about 8 * 10\u22123 for k2 = 10 GeV.\nSuch a severe qualitative change of the result clearly indicates its sensitivity to different\nprescriptions used in the Sudakov form factor. In the view of additional single-log corrections coming from unspecified scales in the logarithms as well as from the extra diagrams\ndiscussed in Section 2.3, which are not yet under control, one must conclude that the claims\nof perturbativity of the k-loop are unjustified. Depending on the assumptions used, the Sudakov suppression can differ by one order of magnitude, and mean k2 can vary from O(0.1)\nto O(1) GeV2 . This uncertainty affects not only numerical results, but also some qualitative\narguments.\nNevertheless, we see that it is possible to get a suppression factor of the order of 100 from\nthe virtual corrections. This reduces our estimate to about 10 nb. An extra suppression of a\nfactor 3 comes from the shift in ET when one goes from partons to jets. We shall discuss this\nin the next section. So we see that all the ingredients of this calculation can lead to a cross\nsection in rough agreement with the data. In fact, we shall show that it is possible to get\nan exact agreement with the data, but that the number of adjustable theoretical corrections\nallows for many theoretical possibilities. Hence the CDF data turn out to be very important\nfor tuning the theory.\n\n6\n\nNumerical results\n\n6.1\n\nCuts\n\nThe two gluons produced through pomeron exchange hadronise into jets. As is unavoidable,\nthis hadronisation can result in any number of jets, not just two. Theoretically, the difference\nbetween the two gluon cross section and the dijet cross section (i.e. the 3-jet veto) is a\ncorrection of the order of \u03b1S (ET ) [46]. Given the large theoretical uncertainties in other parts\nof the calculation, we do not take this correction into account.\nOn the other hand, the transition from the partonic to the hadronic level involves corrections which are larger, and which are due to radiation outside the jet-finding cone - we shall\ngenerically refer to them as splash-out. The structure of these corrections is known [47, 48]\nand involves a constant shift in ET of the order of 1 GeV, due to hadronisation, as well as\na correction proportional to \u03b1S (ET )ET due to radiation. The corresponding shift in ET has\nbeen estimated, for the cone algorithm used by CDF [49] to be\nETjet = (0.75 \u2212 0.80)kTparton\nWe shall also consider a previous parametrisation [50], where\n\u0014\n\u0010\n\u0011\u0015\n1\njet\nparton 2\nparton\nET = kT\n)\n\u2212 1 GeV.\n1 \u2212 \u03b1S (kT\n2\n\n(55)\n\n(56)\n\nOne can then compare our results to the data, for which the cuts are summarised in Table 1.\nWe show in Fig. 9.b the effect of these corrections. We see that for the ET range of the\nCDF data, the effect of splash-out is non-negligible9 and amounts to a correction of the order\n9\n\nWe thank V.

Note that the\nlargest effect comes from the shift in ETmin . We have also considered a smearing in the rapidity\nof the jets, of the order of 1 unit, but this has an effect on the cross section of less than 0.1%.\nSo it seems that in the longitudinal direction, the cuts of Table 1 can be directly applied at\nthe parton level.\nIn the following, we shall fix the splash-out correction to ETjets = 0.80ETpartons . As a\nreference we shall also choose the parametrisation given in Table 2. This is not necessarily our\nbest guess, but rather one of the choices which reproduces the CDF data. We shall include\nother possibilities when we extrapolate our results to the LHC.\n\n6.2\n\nProperties of the amplitude\n\nThe accuracy of several properties and approximations presented in the literature can be\ndirectly tested from their effect on the cross section.\nThe first property is the claim that the cross section is perturbative. We define \u03c3pert as the\nvalue of the cross section in which all gluon momenta are larger than 1 GeV. Although this\nis not a physical observable, it is a useful quantity to test the assumptions used in theoretical\ncalculations. We find that at CDF, the ratio \u03c3pert /\u03c3 is 0.35 for ETmin = 10 GeV, and falls to\n0.25 for ETmin = 35 GeV. Clearly, as already mentioned, the effect of the Sudakov form factor\nis not sufficient to shift the dominant values of the momenta into the perturbative region, and\nwe see that momenta below 1 GeV contribute significantly to the cross section. Note also that\nthe larger ETmin , the softer the gluon loop. This is expected because at fixed proton energy,\nthe production of higher-ET jets requires larger \u03b1i and \u03b2i , and it is a robust property of the\nunintegrated gluon distributions that they become softer at larger x, see e.g.[34].\nIt might be, under those conditions, that modifications to the gluon propagator have to be\ntaken into account [18]. It remains largely unclear however how to take these into account in\na consistent and gauge-invariant way, as modifications to the propagator should also involve\n\n25\n\n\f100\nki \u226a k\n\n1000\n\nCDF analysis\n\u03bc2 = k22 /2\n\u03bc2 = sgg /4\n\n10\n100\n[pb/GeV]\n\n0.1\n\nd\u03c3\ndMjj\n\n\u03c3 [nb]\n\n1\n\n0.01\n0.001\n0.0001\n\n10\n1\n0.1\n0.01\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\nEmin\nT\n\n25\n[GeV]\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n(a)\n\n0.001\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80 100\nMjj [GeV]\n\n120\n\n140\n\n160\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 10: (a) The effect of neglecting ki w.r.t. k or k\u2032 with the parameters of Table 2.

In both figures the plain curve is as in\nFig. 9.\n\nmodifications to the vertices. Also, we have not taken into account the effect of the gap\nsurvival factor, which will reduce the dominant values of ki . Again, the formalism to follow\nseems unclear as the protons communicate with the jet via rather soft momenta.\nThe second point we can test is the neglect of the momenta ki in front of k, which we used\nin our order-of-magnitude estimate (46). We show in Fig. 10.a that this approximation is very\nrough, and that it overestimates the cross section at high ETmin .\nFinally, we confirm that the \u03bb = 0 terms of the cross section (18) dominate the \u03bb = 2\ncontributions, as noticed in [8]. The latter contribute 2% at ETmin = 10 GeV to 3% at\nETmin = 35 GeV.\nCDF also presented in [1] the dijet mass Mjj distribution of the jet system. Note that these\nare not true data but rather predictions of ExHuMe Monte Carlo simulations [51] normalised\nto the data: the ExHuMe cross section is normalised to the data in a given ET bin, and\nthe Mjj distribution comes from summing over all these ET bins. The data is presented\nfor Mjj > 30 GeV, i.e. where the lower ET cut has little influence. In Fig. 10.b, we show\nhow our calculations compare with these distributions. We have produced two curves, both\ncorresponding to minimum ET of 5 GeV, and assumed that the longitudinal splash-out is the\n\u221a\nsame as the transverse one, i.e. we took Mjj = 0.80 sgg . The first curve corresponds to our\nreference curve. It clearly overshoots the CDF points, and predicts a considerably harder Mjj\nspectrum than the ExHuMe Monte Carlo. The second curve goes perfectly though the points.\nThe only difference is that in the latter case, the upper scale of the Sudakov form factor has\nbeen taken as \u03bc2 = sgg /4, close to the choice of ExHuMe which takes \u03bc2 = sgg /2.62, whereas\nin the former case that scale was k22 /2. We see that the two choices of the scale lead to vastly\ndifferent result, as they affect the dependence in x = \u03b21 /\u03b22 of the cross section.\n26\n\n\f100\n\n100\n\n\u03bc2 = k22 /4\n\u03bc2 = k22\n\u03bc2 = sgg /4\n\n10\n\n10\n1\n\u03c3 [nb]\n\n\u03c3 [nb]\n\n1\n0.1\n0.01\n\n0.1\n0.01\n0.001\n\n0.001\n0.0001\n\nl2 = k2\nl = (k + ki )2 /2\nl2 = 2(k + ki )2\n2\n\n0.0001\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\nEmin\nT\n\n25\n[GeV]\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n(a)\n\n1e-05\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n25\n[GeV]\nEmin\nT\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 11: (a) The effect of changing the upper limit of the Sudakov loops by a factor 2, or of\nchoosing sgg /4 instead of k22 ; (b) The effect of changing the lower limit of the Sudakov loops\nby a factor 2. In both figures, the plain curve is as in Fig. 9.\n\nWe argued in Section 2.2 that the upper scale in the Sudakov integral for the dijet production should be related with the relative transverse momentum rather than the invariant\nmass of the dijet. Thus, d\u03c3/dMjj obtained from experimental data without the theoretical\nbias just described would help test this point.\n\n6.3\n\nUncertainties\n\nSo far, we have shown that it is possible, with an appropriate choice of parameters, to reproduce\nthe CDF dijet data via a calculation containing several perturbative ingredients, although the\ndominant momenta are largely in the non-perturbative region. We shall now see why this is\nthe case: there is no firm reason to believe the parameters of Table 2, and different reasonable\nchoices can easily lead to factors of a few up or down. Basically, all the lines of Table 2 can be\nchanged to check on the resulting variation. We shall mention here only the most significant\nones. We stress here that we are not trying to get the highest possible factor: our estimates\nare rather conservative, and based on changes that modest theoretical changes bring into the\ncalculation.\nThe main correction comes from the inclusion of vertex corrections in the form of a Sudakov\nform factor. The upper and lower limits of the integral (19) can be modified while keeping\nsingle-log accuracy. We show in Fig. 11 the effect of such modifications.\nAs we explained above, these plots clearly show that, in this region of ET , the vertex corrections lead to a rather uncertain situation. On the one hand, they are needed to reproduce\nthe data, but on the other, their numerical impact depends on the details of their implementation. We estimate the uncertainty coming from variations of the limits of integration as about\na factor 3 for the lower limit, and 6 for the upper one.\n27\n\n\f100\n10\n1\n\n1\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0.01\n\n0.01\n\n0.001\n\n0.001\n\n0.0001\n\n0.0001\n\n1e-05\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\nEmin\nT\n\n25\n[GeV]\n\n30\n\nUgD\nLCWF\n\n10\n\n\u03c3 [nb]\n\n\u03c3 [nb]\n\n100\n\nSFA[\u03b1s (k22 )]\nDLA[\u03b1s (k22 )]\nDLA\n\n35\n\n40\n\n(a)\n\n1e-05\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n25\n[GeV]\nEmin\nT\n\n30\n\n35\n\n40\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 12: (a) The differential cross section for different choices of the Sudakov form factor:\nDLA stands for the double log approximation, SFA for the splitting function approximation,\nas defined in Section 2.1. The plain curve is as in Fig. 9. (b) The uncertainty coming from\ndifferent choices of impact factors. UgD stands for the unintegrated gluon densities, and\nLCWF for the light-cone impact factors, as explained in Section 3.\n\nFurthermore, we show in Fig. 12.a the effect of changes in the choice of parametrisation.\nWe first show the result of a resummation of log2 terms, including angular ordering, and\nchoosing the scale of \u03b1S as q 2 . As we have seen before, the single-logs are opposite to the\ndouble logs, so that the cross section increases if one includes them. We also show in the same\nfigure the change coming from choosing k22 as the scale of \u03b1S in the Sudakov form factor. One\nsees that the choice of upper and lower limits in the Sudakov integral, and that of scale in \u03b1S\ncan lead to much larger effects than the inclusion of subleading logs and constant terms.\nThe second uncertainty comes from the impact factor, see Fig. 12.b. Several choices of\nunintegrated gluon densities, which differ only in the choice of parametrisation of soft coloursinglet exchange, lead to the shaded band, while the impact factor based on a simple 3-quark\nlight-cone wave function leads to the curve. Although both lead to an acceptable fit to the CDF\ndata, it seems that the curvature is better reproduced by the more sophisticated unintegrated\ngluon density. Uncertainties due to possible parametrisations of the soft region, and to the\nchoice of form factor, amount to a factor of at least 3.\nThe parametrisations of the proton form factor used in this study contain a soft and a\nhard part. The hard part was obtained in [34, 35] within the kt -factorisation formalism, which\nis devised for processes with small-x gluons and not too large transverse momenta. Although\ncentral exclusive production takes place precisely in this regime, one can, in principle, improve\nthe treatment of the hard part in the spirit of the CCFM equation [27, 28], and one can imagine\nthat this improvement will shift numerical results. However, we do not expect it to reduce\nthe spread of different predictions because it comes mainly from our lack of knowledge of the\nproton form factor in the soft region.\n28\n\n\fcuts\nA [52]\nB [53]\n\u03b11 + \u03b12\n[0.002,0.02] [0.005,0.018]\n\u03b21 + \u03b22\n[0.002,0.02] [0.004,0.014]\n(i)\n|yjet|\n<1\n< 1.75\n2\n|\n|ycluster | = 21 | log \u03b1\u03b211 +\u03b2\n\u2212\n< 0.06\n+\u03b12\nMjj\n> 50 GeV\n> 80 GeV\nTable 3: Experimental cuts for the LHC.\nTo these uncertainties one must add that on the gap survival probability and that on the\nparametrisation of the splash-out, so that the overall theoretical uncertainty in the calculation\nis at least a factor 400 between the lowest and the highest estimates.\n\n6.4\n\nPredictions for the LHC\n\nThe formulae derived here can be equally used to estimate the central exclusive dijet production at the LHC. To do this, one needs to take into account the following corrections:\n\u2022 Specific cuts that will be used at the LHC to search for such events. These are given in\nTable 3.\n\u2022 Extrapolation of the proton form factor to the LHC energies.

For an estimate, we will use the prescrip2\ntion: hSLHC\ni = hST2 evatron i/2.\nThe predictions for the LHC based solely on theoretical calculations will be unavoidably\nplagued by the same very large uncertainty as for the Tevatron. Restricting the models with\nthe Tevatron data considerably reduces this uncertainty. In Fig. 13 we show our predictions\nfor the dijet central exclusive production at the LHC. Shown are two bands indicating the\nrange of uncertainties. The inner band represents how different sets of parameters, tuned at\nthe Tevatron to describe the central value of the data, diverge as one extrapolates from the\nTevatron to the LHC. The outer band includes all the parametrisations presented in the other\nfigures of this paper which go through all the CDF points at the 1\u03c3 level.\nWe also checked that the ratio \u03c3pert /\u03c3 described in Section 6.2 is about 0.35 at the LHC,\nconfirming that the gluon loop is still dominated by the soft region.\n\n7\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this paper, we have seen that central exclusive production remains dominated by the nonperturbative region. This means that it is very important to use impact factors - such as\nthe unintegrated gluon densities of [34, 35, 36] - which take the non-perturbative region into\n29\n\n\f1000\n\n1000\n\nCDF uncertainties\nIntrinsic uncertainties\n\n100\n\n10\n\n10\n\n1\n\n1\n\n\u03c3 [pb]\n\n\u03c3 [pb]\n\n100\n\n0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0.01\n\n0.01\n\n0.001\n\n0.001\n\n0.0001\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50 60 70\nEmin\n[GeV]\nT\n\n80\n\nCDF uncertainties\nIntrinsic uncertainties\n\n90\n\n100\n\n0.0001\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n50\n60\n[GeV]\nEmin\nT\n\n70\n\n80\n\nFigure 13: The reference curve extrapolated to the LHC, for the two sets of cuts shown in\nTable 3. The graph to the left corresponds to the cuts given in column A and the one to the\nright to cuts B. The inner bands give the theoretical error for curves reproducing the central\nvalues of the CDF data, and the outer bands correspond to the 1 \u03c3 errors.\n\naccount. We have shown that this dominance of the soft region implies large uncertainties in all\nthe ingredients of the calculation: vertex corrections, impact factors and screening corrections.\nWe evaluate the uncertainty as being a factor 20 up or down, with no theoretically preferred\ncurve.\nAt present, one can tune a perturbative calculation to the CDF run II data on dijet\nexclusive production, and try to use it to predict the cross sections for the production of other\nsystems of particles.\nThere are several problems with this approach. The first one is that the huge Sudakov\nform factors of the dijet case suppress diagrams where the hard scale is concentrated in one\npropagator of the graph. Other graphs, such as those of Fig. 7, where the hard scale flows\nthrough the diagram, are suppressed by propagators, but one may expect the vertex corrections\nto be substantially smaller. So using dijet production as a handle on e.g. Higgs production\nmay be misleading.\nThe second problem concerns the extrapolation to LHC energy. This is due to the fact that\nunitarisation effects will be important when going from 2 TeV to 14 TeV. The embedding of\nthe process in a multi-pomeron environment can be achieved for short-distance hard partonic\nprocesses, leading to the usual gap survival probability. However in general, if the partons are\nnot at very small distances, the gap survival probability will be more complicated, and larger.\nAlso, it is usually assumed that Regge factorisation holds, i.e. that the process can be written\nas a product of factors depending on t1 = k12 and t2 = k32 , which is not the case here.\nClearly, all the above questions can only be settled by comparing to more data. Hence we\nbelieve that a measurement of quasielatic jet production at the LHC, including the rapidity\ndistribution, the mass distribution, as well as the ET distribution, will be a very important\ntask that will help to clarify many of the issues raised in this paper.\n30\n\n\fAcknowledgements\nWe thank M.

The two gluons\nare not required to have large transverse momenta or large invariant mass, but they are well\nseparated in rapidity from the quarks. Besides, we require as usual that there is no overall\ncolour flow in the t-channel. Then, the kinematics and all the simplifications discussed in\nSect. 1.1 and 1.2 still hold, and we are left with two generic diagrams shown in Fig. 4.\nFrom the BFKL point of view, we deal with two-gluon production in the quasi-multi-Regge\nkinematics (qMRK). The imaginary part of the amplitude can be written as\nZ\ng 6 \u03b4 ab\n(2)\u2217\nd2 k e(1)\u2217\n(57)\nImM = ImMa + ImMb = s 2\n\u03bc1 a e\u03bc2 b\n2\u03c0 4N\n\u0014\n\u0015\nC2\u03bc1 \u03bc2\nC \u03bc1 C\u0303 \u03bc2\n\u00d7\n\u2212\n.\nk2 (k + k1 )2 (k + k3 )2 k2 (k + k1 )2 (k + k2 )2 (k + k2 \u2212 k3 )2\nHere C \u03bc1 and C\u0303 \u03bc2 are the usual Lipatov effective vertices (the tilde indicates that this vertex\noriginates from the other t-channel leg), e.g.\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\n(k + k1 )2\n(k + k2 )2\n\u03bc1\n\u03bc1\n\u03bc1\n\u03b21 \u2212 2\n\u03b11 \u2212 2\n\u2212q\n+ (2k + k1 + k2 )\u03bc1 ,\n(58)\nC =p\n\u03b21 s\n\u03b11 s\nwhile C2\u03bc1 \u03bc2 is the effective RRGG vertex for two gluon production in qMRK [22].

If the loop corrections to this diagram can be\nresummed and presented in a form analogous to the Sudakov form factor, then the k2 -integral\nwill be shifted towards large values and no logarithmic enhancement in this new suppressing\nfactor will occur. Hence the new Sudakov form factor may be much larger than the usual one.\n\nB\n\nIntermediate production of gluons in multi-Regge\nkinematics as a source of corrections\nto central exclusive production\n\nIf a colourless high-mass system f can be \"radiated\" off the t-channel gluons, then the same\nsystem can be produced via two intermediate gluons in multi-Regge kinematics (MRK) fol32\n\n\fFigure 14: a: Generic diagram representing production of two gluons in MRK followed by their\nfusion into the high mass system. b: extra gluon rungs above or below the central subprocess\ncan be incorporated into the definition of the unintegrated gluon density. c: an extra gluon\nrung that couples the central subprocess with the screening t-channel gluon represents a singlelog correction to the vertex. d: higher-order single-log enhanced correction to diagram Fig. 8.c.\n\nlowed by their fusion into f , see Fig. 8. We do not present here a detailed calculation of this\nprocess; however, it can be immediately seen from (4) and (57) that the resulting cross section\nis flat in rapidities of the intermediate gluons. Integrating over the corresponding lightcone\nvariables but keeping Mf2 fixed yields an extra longitudinal logarithm. The particular diagram shown in Fig. 14.a is in fact a double-log-enhanced correction to the direct production\nof system f . In the standard calculation it is effectively included via the Sudakov form factor.\nEven higher-order corrections to this diagram include diagrams with extra gluon rungs that\njoin the two t-channel gluons. If these extra gluons are above or below the central subprocess,\nas in Fig. 14.b, they can be absorbed into the definition of the unintegrated gluon density.\nHowever, if the gluon is attached inside the central subprocess, Fig. 14.c, it leads to a correction\nto the effective vertex and cannot be absorbed into the gluon density.\nThis correction is enhanced by a single logarithm. If the lightcone variables of the two\nintermediate gluons are \u03b21 \u226b \u03b22 , then the logarithm that appears is of type\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0012 2\u0013\nMf\n\u03b21\nlog\n\u2248 log\n,\n\u03b22\nq2\nwhere q2 is the (moderate) transverse momentum of the intermediate gluons. Thus, this diagram represents a single-log enhanced correction to the central exclusive production of system\nf , which involves the screening gluons and which is absent in the pure gg \u2192 f process. Since\nthe single-log enhanced terms in the Sudakov integral are very important for the kinematic\nrange considered, one must take seriously such corrections.\nAs the production of two gluons in MRK requires gluon emission from both t-channel legs,\none encounters additional single-log enhanced diagrams such as shown in Fig. 14.d.\nWe would like also to stress that, even without the above estimates, there is a need to\nevaluate such \"non-conventional\" diagrams, which stems directly from self-consistency of one's\napproach. Indeed, if one believes the diagrams such as Fig. 14.d are not logarithmically\nenhanced, then the bare diagram Fig. 8.c does not get suppressed at all. It can then become\ncomparable with the usual Sudakov-suppressed diagrams, as was explained in Section 2.3. If,\non the other hand, Fig. 14.d and similar diagrams are logarithmically enhanced, one needs to\nresum them to estimate their effect.\n\n33\n\n\fReferences\n[1] T. Aaltonen et al.
