Prospects for\nthe measurements at the Large Hadron Collider based on generator level\nsimulations are outlined.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nOne of the yet unveiled mysteries in nature is the mechanism that gives mass to\nquarks, leptons and gauge bosons breaking the electroweak symmetry. The top\nquark, the heaviest elementary fermion observed, constitutes per s\u00e9 a puzzle in\nthis context not only due to its large mass (close to a Yb atom) but also due\nto the fact that it is practically decoupled from the lighter quark generations\ndecaying almost solely into the t \u2192 W b channel. The study of top quark events\nand its properties is therefore potentially an interesting topic and one of the last\nbarriers to cross in the search for physics beyond the Standard Model (SM) of\ninteractions.\nIn the context of the SM and at hadron colliders, such as the Tevatron or the\nLarge Hadron Collider (LHC), top quarks are produced through the interaction\nof quarks and gluons, either in pairs or as single Top production (through the\ns\u2212, t\u2212, tW \u2212channels). While tt\u0304 pairs are mostly created from pure QCD\nprocesses, single top quark production is more often produced from electroweak\nprocesses and its production cross section is directly proportional to the (square\nof the) CKM matrix elements related to the top quark, i.e. Vtq . Therefore,\nthe measurement of single Top cross section in the different channels provides\n\u2217 Laborat\u00f3rio de Instrumenta\u00e7\u00e3o e F\u0131\u0301sica Experimental de Part\u0131\u0301culas (LIP) - Av. Elias\nGarcia 14 - 10 1000-149 Lisboa Portugal.\n\n1\n\n\fa direct measurement of the CKM matrix elements. However, results from\nsingle Top production are still constrained mainly due to the limited number of\nevents (at the Tevatron, the single Top cross section is \u223c2.8 pb, while tt\u0304 pair\nproduction has a cross section of \u223c7.5 pb) and to the larger relative background\ncontribution. In practice, single top quark discovery has only been reported\nrecently. The value of Vtb is measured with an 8% relative uncertainty, assuming\nthat Vts , Vtd \u001c Vtb [2] [3]. A more accurate determination of the separate\ncontributions of the different channels is expected to be feasible at the LHC,\nand the sensitivity to the tW \u2212channel will be in the reach of the experiments for\nthe first time. A direct determination of the t\u2212channel cross section is expected\nto yield a measurement of Vtb with an overall uncertainty of 5% after 10 fb\u22121 [4].\nTop quark pairs may provide an indirect measurement of Vtb , through the flavor\ndetermination of the Top quark decay products. In particular, the ratio of\nbranching fractions of the the top quark\nB(t \u2192 W b)\nR= X\nB(t \u2192 W q)\n\n(1)\n\nq\n\ncan be measured in the data and, by assuming the unitarity \u221a\nof the CKM\nmatrix elements, one can infer |Vtb |2 from Eq. 1 and derive Vtb = R. This indirect measurement has been explored at the Tevatron [5, 6]. The measurement\nusing tt\u0304 pair events profits from the larger\u221a\nproduction cross section (\u223c7.5 pb at\nthe Tevatron and \u223c908 pb for the LHC at s=14 TeV) and from the distinctive\ntt\u0304 experimental signature with a much reduced relative background contamination.\nResults always suffer however from the systematic uncertainties related to:\ni) the imperfect knowledge of the efficiency of the algorithms used to identify the\nflavor of jets (\"b-tagging\"), and to ii) the background modeling. In the current\nTevatron results, R is determined with a relative uncertainty of \u223c9% [5]. Notice\nthat R \u2248 1 is a direct indication of the strong hierarchy between the top quark\nsector and the lighter quark generations. However, R \u2248 1 can still be compatible\nwith Vtb < 1 if the structure of the CKM matrix is different from the one\nassumed in the SM (e.g. if a fourth family of quarks exists or if the top quark\nsector couples to a massive vector like quark t0 ). The current measurements of R\nand Vtb have not yet reached the required precision to discard such hypotheses.\nTherefore the measurement of both R and the deviations in the heavy flavor\ncontent of tt\u0304 events are particularly important to search for evidence of New\nPhysics at the LHC. A brief summary of the SM experimental signature of the\ntop quark events and examples of how the tt\u0304 sample can be contaminated by\nnon-SM processes are given in Sec. 2. The discussion of the method and how\nthe measurement of R and of the cross section can be performed at the LHC\nwith early data is discussed in Sec. 3. Conclusions are summarized in Sec. 4.\n\n2\n\nTop quark decays: Standard Model and beyond\n\nDue to their large mass (mt > mW + mb ), top quarks decay promptly without\nhadronizing, t \u2192 W b. Other decays, such as t \u2192 W s and t \u2192 W d are sup-\n\n2\n\n\fpressed in the context of the SM, approximately by a factor of 10\u22123 \u00f7 10\u22124 .\nIn the prompt decay scenario, the polarization of the top quark is transferred\nto the decay products and three final polarization states can be expected. As\nmb \u001c mt , it is possible to assume in first approximation that the bottom quark\nbehaves almost as a massless particle and that it can mostly acquire left-hand\npolarization, and the polarization of the top quark is transferred to the W according to the ratio mW /mt . In this approximation, right-polarized W states\nare highly suppressed and the transversal polarization states are dominant.\nThe W boson decay channels determine the experimental signature of a tt\u0304\nevent: \"fully hadronic\", \"lepton+jets\", or \"dilepton\" events accompanied by\nthe presence of two b jets are therefore expected. In hadron collisions, tt\u0304 pairs\nare also accompanied by an underlying event which is the result of the proton\nremnants and by extra initial and final state radiation (ISR/FSR) jets.\nAmong all, the dilepton channel has a particularly clean final state with\ntwo oppositely charged prompt and isolated leptons with large pT , at least two\njets from b-decays and large missing transverse energy from the neutrinos. The\nbranching fraction of the tt\u0304 dilepton channel is B[tt\u0304 \u2192 (l\u03bdl b)(l\u03bdl b)] = 0.065\u00b10.001\n(l = e, \u03bc) [7]. SM processes that can mimic the dilepton channel involve mainly\nthe production of Z and W bosons, either as single particles or in pairs (i.e. diboson production). For instance the same-flavor dilepton channels (i.e. ee and\n\u03bc\u03bc) can be mimicked by Drell-Yan processes, mainly from Z boson production,\nthat can be distinguished from tt\u0304 events by excluding dileptons with a mass\nclose to the Z boson. Single top production, in particular the tW channel can\nalso mimic the dilepton channel final state, but with a much lower cross section.\nQCD events, although expected to be the dominant production at a hadron\ncollider, are not expected to produce isolated, high-pT leptons. Therefore the\npossible contamination from this processes is expected to be small, and mostly\ndue to instrumental and misreconstruction effects. In the dilepton channel the\npresence of at least two neutrinos accounts for an experimental transverse energy imbalance in the detector which can possibly discriminate further tt\u0304 events\nagainst background.\nProcesses not contemplated in the SM may also contaminate the tt\u0304 sample.\nSearching for deviations of the basic properties of tt\u0304 events, as they are predicted\nby the SM, is therefore an important topic of investigation at the LHC. Measuring the production cross section, the mass, width and branching fractions of\nthe top quark, the polarization of the final state particles and the jet content of\nthe events are some examples of these studies. In this manuscript an emphasis\nis put on the search for deviations in the jet flavor content of the data sample.\nSome examples which may alter the heavy flavor content of the tt\u0304 sample\ncan be found in the literature:\n\u2022 associated Higgs boson production, decaying to a bb\u0304 pair (i.e. tt\u0304H \u2192 tt\u0304bb\u0304).\nAlthough the cross section is expected to be small, it may be enhanced by\nnon-SM processes such as G0 \u2192 t0 t\u0304 \u2192 tt\u0304H where G0 is a heavy color octet\nboson and t0 is a vector-like fermion [8]. At the time this manuscript is\nwritten a lower mass limit of 311 GeV/c2 has been set for t0 by the CDF\nexperiment with 2.8 f b\u22121 of data [9];\n\u2022 if a 4th generation of quarks exists, then decay cascades containing top\nquarks could be produced. These events are expected to have either extra\njets or additional leptons from the decays of multiple W bosons. Results\n3\n\n\ffrom the CDF experiment set a lower limit for mb0 >325 GeV/c2 with\n2.7 fb\u22121 of data [10];\n\u2022 in the context of a supersymmetric theory, the mixing of chiral and scalar\nstates could be privileged in the top quark sector due to its large mass. If\n\u03c7\u03030 is assumed as the lightest supersymmetric particle and the stop mass\nis (m\u03c7\u0303+ + mb ) < mt\u0303 . mt , then g\u0303g\u0303 \u2192 tt\u0303q q\u0303 (or t\u0303t\u0303) is allowed with the stop\n1\ndecaying further in t\u0303 \u2192 t\u03c7\u03030 is expected to have the typical signature of a tt\u0304\npair plus additional E T due to undetected neutral particles, and possibly\nlarger lepton/jet multiplicities. Limits on stop mass were obtained by the\nCDF experiment with 2.7 fb\u22121 of data for different values of B(\u03c7\u0303+\n1 \u2192\n\u03c7\u030301 l\u03bdl ) and \u03c701 masses [11];\n\u2022 the production of a charged Higgs from a top quark decay can also be expected in the context of supersymmetry if mt > mH + + mb . This scenario\nwould be reflected by an increase in the production of the \u03c4 dilepton channel with respect to the other channels from H + \u2192 \u03c4 \u03bd\u03c4 decays. However,\nin the case of leptophobic H + an increase of charm and strange particles\nfrom the production of cs\u0304 pairs could also be expected. With 1.0 fb\u22121\nthe D0 collaboration performs a model-independent measurement which\nexcludes B(t \u2192 H + b) > 0.12-0.26 at 95% C.L. depending on MH + [12].\nUsing a different approach from the various phenomenological scenarios just\nbriefly reviewed, a generic model-independent search aimed at the study of the\nheavy flavor content of tt\u0304 events is proposed in the following [1]. If measurements\nin the data are compatible with the SM expectations, Vtb can be determined\nunder the particular assumption on the structure of the CKM matrix.\n\n3\n\nProbing the heavy flavor in tt\u0304 events\n\nDecay products of top quark events are expected to contain b-jets, resulting\neither from the top quarks or other heavy particle decays as reviewed earlier.\nExperimentally, the flavor of a jet can be identified by taking advantage of the\nproperties of the hadrons containing b quarks.\nB hadrons are long-lived with proper-lifetimes typically of the order of\nc\u03c4B \u2248 450 \u03bcm. After the decay of long-lived hadrons into charged particles,\na secondary vertex of tracks associated to a jet might be found. In \u224820% of\nthe cases these jets can also contain an electron or a muon due to the semileptonic branching ratio of the B mesons. Therefore, jets produced by heavy\nflavor quarks can be identified by displaced tracks or secondary charged leptons.\nThe \"b-tagging\" algorithms exploit these simple properties to build discriminator variables which can be used to identify the flavor of a jet. Each algorithm is\nusually characterized by an efficiency of identifying b jets (\u03b5b ) and a \"mis-tag\"\nrate due to mis-identification of light quark and gluon initiated jets (\u03b5q ) [13].\nExperimentally, \u03b5b can be measured in QCD events with reconstructed jets containing muons. These events are most likely b-jet enriched events (i.e. from\nbb\u0304) and allow one to evaluate the b-tagging efficiency using a \"tag and probe\"\nmethod. The mistag rate can also be estimated from data using the fact that\nfor light quark and gluon-initiated jets the tracks are distributed randomly in\nthe vicinity of the primary vertex of the hard interaction. Therefore, the tracks\n4\n\n\fproduced upstream with respect to the primary vertex of the hard interaction\ncan be used to extrapolate the contamination in the b-tagging region. Both measurements are sensitive to the alignment of the tracker detector, to the track\nreconstruction efficiency and resolution of the track impact parameter and to\nthe resolution of the vertices.\nBy using the b tagging algorithms just described, a method can be developed\nto probe flavor deviations in the decays of tt\u0304 pairs. Generator level simulations\nare used in the following to illustrate how to apply the method to the data.\n\n3.1\n\nDescription of the method\n\nEvidence for the heavy flavor content of the tt\u0304 final states can be obtained by\ncounting the b-tag multiplicity found in the selected events. The number of btags counted in the events is proportional to the fraction of b jets present in the\nsample, and is related to \u03b5b and \u03b5q . Ultimately, the number of b jets produced\ndepends on the ratio of branching fractions of the top quark to bottom quarks\n(Eq. 1). In particular, a simple selection of tt\u0304 dilepton events can be devised\nwhere the final sample is dominated by top quark events over the background\n(S/B \u2248 16). An example of the b-tag multiplicity distribution of tt\u0304 dilepton\nevents is shown in Fig. 1 (left). The distribution is obtained from Monte Carlo\n(MC) using typical values for \u03b5b and \u03b5q , randomly thrown to assign each jet\na b-tag. The two b-tag multiplicity bin clearly dominates, as expected in a\ntt\u0304-dominated sample where two jets are from heavy flavor jets.\n\nFigure 1: (Left) b-tagging multiplicity obtained assuming a jet is b-tagged assuming \u03b5b =80% and \u03b5q =15%. (Right) Probability model for the observation of\nk b-tags in events with two jets, as function of R.\nAlthough in the dilepton channel small contributions are expected from background processes, there is a non-negligible probability that at least one jet from\na tt\u0304 decay is either missed because it was not reconstructed or because it did\nnot pass the jet selection criteria. Another jet that may be selected instead\ncould, for example, be a jet initiated from ISR or FSR. This will be referred to\nas \"jet misassignment\" and its determination from data is discussed in detail\nin Sec. 3.3. The b-tag multiplicity distribution reflects also the fraction of jet\nmisassignment in the sample, namely the fractions of events with:\n5\n\n\f\u2022 no jet from the top decays selected (background-dominated);\n\u2022 only one jet correctly assigned to a top decay (combination of signal and\nbackground);\n\u2022 two jets correctly assigned to the top decays (signal-dominated).\nThe relative contributions\nP of these three classes of events can be expressed\nby the weights \u03b1i , where i \u03b1i = 1 and i = 0, 1, 2 is the number of jets from top\ndecays correctly reconstructed and selected. For example, \u03b12 is the probability\nthat both jets are correctly assigned to b jets.\nUsing R, \u03b5b , \u03b5q and the \u03b1i (as previously defined), it is possible to model\nprobabilistically the average b-tagging multiplicity. The number of expected\nevents with k tagged jets can be generically written as follows:\nN\u0302ev (k b \u2212 tags) =\n\nall\njets\nX\n\njets\nNev (n jets) * Pkn b\u2212tags\n\n(2)\n\nn jets=2\njets\nwhere Nev (n jets) is the number of observed events with n-jets, and Pkn b\u2212tags\nis the probability to count k b-tags in a n-jet event. The probability function\nencloses the available knowledge on R, \u03b5b , \u03b5q and \u03b1i . In order to illustrate\nexplicitly the construction of such probability functions, the exclusive two-jet\nmultiplicity bin is used and the following expression is obtained:\n\njets\nPk2 b\u2212tags\n=\n\n2\nX\n\n\u03b1i * Pk\n\ni | 2 jets\nb\u2212tags\n\n(3)\n\ni jets=0\nfrom top decay\n\nwhere the \u03b1i parameters describe the composition of the sample in terms of\nevents with i-jets from top quark decays correctly reconstructed and selected,\ni | 2 jets\nand Pk b\u2212tags is the probability that k b-tags are observed in an event with two\njets of which i jets come from tt\u0304 decays. Extra jets can be reconstructed and\nselected in the selected events mainly coming from Initial/Final state radiation\nproduced along with the tt\u0304 pair. This extra jets can mimic tt\u0304 events even if\nnot coming directly from top decays. The previous expression can therefore be\nfurther developed and, in particular for the case where two tagged jets are found\nin a 2-jet event, the probability can be explicitly written as:\nP2\n\n0 | 2 jets\nb\u2212tags\n\n= \u03b52q\n\nif no jets are from tt\u0304 decays\n\nP2\n\n1 | 2 jets\nb\u2212tags\n\n= 2R2 \u03b5b \u03b5q + 2R(1 \u2212 R)(\u03b5b + \u03b5q )\u03b5q + 2(1 \u2212 R)2 \u03b52q\n\nif 1 jet is from tt\u0304 decays\n\nP2\n\n2 | 2 jets\nb\u2212tags\n\n= R2 \u03b52b + 2R(1 \u2212 R)\u03b5b \u03b5q + (1 \u2212 R)2 \u03b52q\n\nif 2 jets are from tt\u0304 decays\n\n(4)\nSo far, the probability model has been derived for the most relevant case\nwhich is the observation of two b-tags in the 2-jet multiplicity bin. The model\ncan be expanded to a more general situation but it is omitted from this manuscript\nfor the sake of simplicity. In this probability model it is assumed that:\n\n6\n\n\f1. the correlation between the probability of observing single and double tags\nis negligible;\n2. for higher jet multiplicity bins the probability can be computed from the\njets\nproduct of Pk2 b\u2212tags\nwith the probability of observing the extra tags from\nthe extra radiation jets;\n3. the mistag rate \u03b5q is an effective measurement of the probability of \"tagging\" light quark, gluon and charmed jets in the dilepton sample. In first\napproach, it is taken as the mistag rate for light quark and gluon jets\nbut can also be derived directly from data as it will be shown in the next\nSection.\nBy summing up the contributions from events with 2, 1 or no correctly\nassigned jets (weighted by \u03b1i ), as expressed in Eq. 3, one builds the probability\nmodel shown in Fig. 1 (right).\nUsing the generic Eq. 2, R can be fit from the b-tag multiplicity distributions\nby maximizing the likelihood function:\n\nL(R, \u03b5b , \u03b5q , \u03b1i ) =\n\nallY\njets\n\nPoisson[Nev (k b \u2212 tags), N\u0302ev (k b \u2212 tags)]\n\n(5)\n\nk=0\n\nwhere Nev (k b \u2212 tags) is the number of observed events with k b\u2212tags.\nEquation 5 can be used to perform the fit using different choices and subsamples of the selected events. The results obtained will be discussed in more\ndetail by applying the model to a MC generated sample.\n\n3.2\n\nDilepton sample selection\n\nIn order to illustrate the potential of the method described, a dilepton sample\nwas generated using MadGraph [14] and Pythia [15] generators with R = 1.\nInclusive tt\u0304 events and the most relevant background processes: single top,\nW/Z+jets, WW, WZ, ZZ and QCD were generated. The events are selected\nmimicking a realistic dilepton event selection from reconstructed events as the\nones proposed by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations [16, 17, 18].\nA simple event selection requires the presence of two high-pT isolated leptons,\neither electron or muon, at least two jets, and large missing transverse energy.\nThis simple selection of the tt\u0304 dilepton channel yields a clean sample with S/B \u2248\n16 1 . For the study presented here it is expected to collect 650-700 events,\nwhereas only 6% of the events\n\u221a are from background sources when an integrated\nluminosity of 100 pb\u22121 at s=10 TeV is considered. The exact number of the\nevents selected is not relevant to the results of the method presented here, as it\nwill become clear.\nIn the selected samples (signal and background), the number of events with\n2, 1 or 0 jets from top quark decays correctly reconstructed and selected can be\n1 For proton-proton collisions at a center of mass energy of 7 TeV it can be inferred from\nthe re-scaling of signal and background cross sections obtained with the Pythia generator that\nthe S/B figure of merit should decrease by approximately 30%. It must be noted that cuts\nhave been gauged for 10 TeV collisions and optimization of the S/B can be performed for 7\nTeV collision.\n\n7\n\n\fcounted using MC truth. Table 1 shows the fraction of events with 2, 1 or 0 jets\n(i.e. the values for the \u03b1i introduced in Sec. 3.1). In first approximation, the \u03b1i\ncan be parameterized as a binomial combination of \u03b1, the probability that a jet\nfrom a top quark decay is reconstructed and selected. The probability to have\ntwo jets from tt\u0304 decays reconstructed and correctly assigned (independently of\nits flavor) is therefore given by \u03b12 = \u03b12 . Conversely, the probability that both\njets from the top decay are missed in the selected event is given by \u03b10 = (1\u2212\u03b1)2 .\nOne jet from top decay is expected to be selected with a probability given by\n\u03b11 = 2(1 \u2212 \u03b1)\u03b1. The values for \u03b1 are also shown in Tab. 1 and were obtained\nby fitting a binomial to the \u03b1i .\nTable 1: Values of \u03b1i for the selected events computed using MC truth. Different\ndilepton channels are shown The last column shows the value of \u03b1 that fits best\nthe \u03b1i with a binomial function (see text).

It will be explained in the\nfollowing.\n\n3.3\n\nJet misassignment estimate from data\n\nThe \u03b1i values can be estimated directly from data using the kinematic properties\nof the events. The method presented suggests to minimally rely on the MC\nsimulation in order to minimize the uncertainty due to the MC model.\nThe lepton-jet pairs originating from the same top quark decay are kinematically correlated. The distribution of the angle between the lepton and jet\ndirections of motion in the W -boson rest frame, and the lepton-jet invariant\nmass are often pointed out as possible variables which depict experimentally\nthe existing correlation between particles produced from the same top decay\ncascade [19]. The lepton-jet\npinvariant mass shape is Jacobian with a kinematimax\n\u2261 m2t \u2212 m2W \u2248156 GeV/c2 after which no lepton-jet\ncal end-point at Ml,b\npair from tt\u0304 decays is observed. On the other hand, the invariant mass of misassigned lepton-jet pairs exhibits a longer tail towards high mass values. The\nshape of these distributions depend on the tt\u0304 pair kinematics and on the contamination from ISR/FSR jets in the sample. Two methods are proposed to\nmodel the invariant mass distribution of the mis-assigned lepton-jet pairs (i.e.\nbackground model):\n\u2022 \"random rotation\" of the momentum of the selected leptons, p~ \u2192\np~e(\u03b8, \u03c6);\n\u2022 \"swap\" the jet in the assigned lepton-jet pair, with a jet from a different\nevent.\n\n8\n\n\fIn practice these two methods yield similar invariant mass spectra and\ntheir average is used, which will be referred to as the combinatorial \"misassignment\" model. Figure 2 (left) shows the invariant mass distribution of\nthe mis-assignment model after it has been rescaled in order to reproduce the\ntail of the inclusive lepton-jet spectrum for masses Ml,j >190 GeV/c2 . In the\n\"data\" sample, each lepton (electron or muon) is paired with all selected jets and\nthe invariant mass is computed for all pairs. The distribution of the correctly\nassigned lepton-jet pairs, derived from MC truth information, is also shown.\nThe correct assignment distribution together with the mis-assignment model\nsums up correctly (within uncertainties) reproducing the inclusive lepton-jet invariant mass spectrum (\"data\" points). The mis-assignment model describes\nwell the expected (true) lepton-jet mis-assignment distribution in most of the\nmass region of the spectrum (Ml,j > 40 GeV/c2 ). The low mass region of the\nspectrum (Ml,j < 40 GeV/c2 ), which is due to almost collinear lepton-jet pairs,\nis expected to be suppressed in real data because the leptons are required to be\nisolated and the jets to be separated from the selected leptons [16, 18].\nFigure 2 (right) shows the distributions of the lepton-jet invariant mass pairs\nafter the subtraction of the mis-assignment model. Good agreement with the\ncorrect assignment distribution (obtained using MC truth) is found in the high\nmass region (Mlj > 190 GeV/c2 ) where the mis-assignments dominate and no\nsignal lepton-jet pairs are expected.\n\nFigure 2: (Left) Inclusive lepton-jet invariant mass distribution. The spectrum\nobtained from the mis-assignment model described in the text is shown together\nwith the distribution of the correctly (using MC truth) assigned lepton-jet pairs.\n(Right) Invariant mass distribution of the lepton-jet pairs after the background\nis subtracted.\nThe contribution of jet mis-assignment (i.e. background) can be fit directly\nfrom the mis-assignment model by computing the ratio of areas below the Ml,j\ndistributions, in \"data\" and in the mis-assignment model\" (Fig. 2, left). The\nratio is expected to flatten out in the region dominated by the background\n(typically Ml,j >190 GeV/c2 ) and it provides the normalization factor of the\nbackground. If:\n\u2022 n(Ml,j ) is the distribution of all lepton-jet pairs as a function of the pair\n9\n\n\fmass (total number of pairs is N );\n\u2022 nmis (Ml,j ) is the distribution of only mis-assigned pairs (total number of\nmis-assignments is Nmis ),\nthen, for Ml,j > z, it is assumed that all the pairs are mis-assigned.\nM\n\nNmisl,j\n\n>z\n\n= N Ml,j >z\n\n(6)\n\nThe fraction-f of background pairs with Ml,j > z can be used to estimate\nMl,j >z\nthe total number of mis-assignments, Nmis . If Nmodel\nis the number of background pairs predicted by the background model with Ml,j > z and Nmodel is\nnormalized to the total number of pairs, then it is assumed that:\nM\n\nf=\n\nM\n\n>z\n\nNmisl,j\nNmis\n\n=\n\n>z\n\nl,j\nNmodel\nNmodel\n\n(7)\n\nUsing the previous result, one can normalize the background model to the\nsignal depleted range (i.e.Ml,j > z) Then, the fraction of correctly assigned\nlepton-jet pairs is given by:\nN\n\nMl,j >z\n\nN \u2212 mis\nN \u2212 Nmis\nf\n\u03b1=\n=\n2 Nevts\n2 Nevts\n\nN\n=\n2 Nevts\n\n1\u2212\n\nNmisl,j\n\nM\n\n>z\n\nM\n\n>z\n\nl,j\nNmodel\n\n!\n(8)\n\nThe value of \u03b1, estimated by applying Eq. 8 to the lepton-jet invariant mass\nspectrum, yields \u03b1 = 0.82 \u00b1 0.03 for the \"e\u03bc\" sample, and \u03b1 = 0.80 \u00b1 0.03 for\nthe \"ee and \u03bc\u03bc\" sample, in agreement with the MC-expected values of Tab. 1\n(right column), within uncertainties.\nThe robustness of the method described for the determination of \u03b1 can be\ntested by artificially modifying some of the parameters. The selected events\nare re-weighted depending on the number of jets from top decays, after reconstruction and selection. The resulting distribution of the difference between the\nvalue obtained from \"data\" and the true generated value, i.e. (\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b1M C ), is\nshown as a function of \u03b1M C in Fig. 3. The results are compatible with zero bias,\nmeaning the method is able to reproduce the correct number of reconstructed\njets from top quark decays. Variation of other parameters which are affected by\nexperimental uncertainties, such as lepton and jet energy scales, or which are\nintrinsic to the method itself, such as the mass cut used to determine the normalization of the misassignment model, are are listed in Tab. 2. Overall, these\nvariations account for <0.02% in the determination of \u03b1. One can therefore\nconclude that the determination of \u03b1 is expected to robust and to be dominated\nby the statistical uncertainty.\n\n3.4\n\nMeasurement of R\n\nThe measurement of R can be performed by fitting the b-tagging multiplicity\ndistribution (Fig. 1) using the probability model (Eq. 5): R is let to float freely\nwithout any constraint, and \u03b5b and \u03b5q are taken as inputs. The \u03b1i are measured\nfrom the \"data\" as described in Sec. 3.3. Figure 4 (left) shows the results\nobtained by fitting R to the b-tagging multiplicity distribution for ee/e\u03bc and e\u03bc\nevents, separately. The result is statistically compatible with MC expectations:\n\n10\n\n\fFigure 3: Deviation of the value of \u03b1 derived from \"data\" with respect to the\nMC value, \u03b1gen (see text).\n\nTable 2: Deviations in \u03b1 from the variation (shift) of different parameters.

By performing\nseveral pseudo-experiments and repeating the fit to the b-tagging multiplicity\ndistributions one obtains a good agreement with the MC truth, i.e. \u03b4R =<\nR > \u2212RM C = -0.006 \u00b1 0.04 ( -0.008\u00b1 0.04 ) for the e\u03bc (ee/\u03bc\u03bc) sample. The\nprocedure has been also tested on pseudo-experiments where RM C < 1. The\nfit converges correctly to the generated value with similar uncertainties as the\nones quoted above.\nThe method can be easily extended to the simultaneous measurement of R\nand other quantities, such as \u03b10 (i.e. the contribution from events where no\njet from top quark decays has been reconstructed and selected), \u03b5q (i.e. the\nmistagging efficiency), or the tt\u0304 cross section which is discussed in more detail\nin Sec. 3.6. Such fits can be used as a cross check for the value of \u03b10 or \u03b5q\nused as inputs for the measurement of R, or in the latter case to perform a\nsimultaneous measurement of two variables. It is important to notice that the\nconvergence of the fit is mostly driven by the experimental knowledge of \u03b5b .\nAs R and \u03b5b are correlated it is not possible to measure simultaneously these\nquantities from the same sample. Figure 4 (right) shows the contour plots of R\nand \u03b5b . This contour plot can also be used to cross check the b-tagging efficiency\nused as input to the fit.\n\nFigure 4: (Left) Fit results for R. (Right) Contour plots (1\u03c3, 2\u03c3 and 3\u03c3) for the\nlikelihood obtained by floating R and \u03b5b . In the MC, R =1, \u03b5b =0.80, \u03b5q =0.15\nfor both plots.\nThe robustness of the method used to determine R is dominated by the\nuncertainty on the knowledge of the b-tagging efficiency. With the first data\nacquired and the events selected for this measurement, only an average value\nfor \u03b5b can be used due to the limited number of events. When more data will\nbe available, the jet pT and \u03b7 dependence of \u03b5b can be used. The measurement\nof R is also affected by the variation in \u03b5q and \u03b1. The uncertainty in \u03b1 is\naffected by the factors discussed in Sec. 3.3. These uncertainties are small when\ncompared to the uncertainty from the b-tagging efficiency. Variation of ISR/FSR\ncontamination of the sample does not affect much the final result of the fit as\nthese variations are correctly described when \u03b1 is estimated from data. Table 3\nsummarizes how R is expected to be affected from the variation of the different\n12\n\n\ffit parameters.\nTable 3: Variation of R due to the variation of the different fit parameters. \u03b5b\nis varied by 10% and \u03b5q is varied by 5%.

The uncertainty in the measurement of R is comparable to the reach\nof the Tevatron experiments at the time this manuscript was written. With more\ndata it is reasonable to expect this uncertainty to decrease significantly [16, 20].\nNotice that the parameters affect the different dilepton channels in the same way.\nThis feature is particularly important because it allows one to cancel out some\nsystematic uncertainties by taking the ratio of the measurements obtained in the\ndifferent channels. Combined measurements of R can therefore be performed\nwith the purpose of reducing the systematic uncertainties. A procedure for\ncombined measurements is proposed in the next Section.\n\n3.5\n\nCombination of results in different channels\n\nThe experimental uncertainty in the b-tagging efficiency is the dominant factor\naffecting the measurement of R. However this uncertainty can be controlled\nby combining the measurements of R obtained from different channels. The\nprocedure can be in fact generalized. For instance, the uncertainty in \u03b1 can\nbe controlled by combining the measurements of R obtained from different jet\nmultiplicity bins in the same tt\u0304 channel. With early data an iterative procedure\ncan therefore be adopted taking advantage of different tt\u0304 channels or control\nregions of the sample in order to control the systematic uncertainties affecting\nthis measurement. Generically one can:\n\u2022 divide the sample in two regions: A and B - e.g. two different channels or\ntwo different jet multiplicity bins;\n\u2022 fit the b-tag multiplicity distributions:\n\u2013 in sample A, assume R = 1 and leave the parameter x = \u03b5b , \u03b1, ... to\nfloat freely in the fit;\n\u2013 in sample B, assume an initial estimate for parameter x = \u03b5b , \u03b1, ...\nand leave R to float freely in the fit;\n\u2022 the fit yields a value of x for sample A and a value of R for sample B;\n13\n\n\f\u2022 repeat the fit giving as input R(B)/x(A) to sample A/B;\n\u2022 if the value R(B)/x(A) maximizes the likelihood in sample A/B it is kept\notherwise the previous value is maintained;\n\u2022 the fit is repeated until no variation is observed in the values of R and x\nobtained from each sample.\nAs an example, such procedure is applied to region A (\"ee/\u03bc\u03bc\" sample) and\nregion B (\"e\u03bc\" sample). The b-tagging efficiency is measured in region A, and\nR is measured in region B. As \u03b5b and R are fully correlated, a Gaussian term is\nadded to the likelihood presented in 5 as follows:\n\nL(R, \u03b5b , \u03b5q , \u03b1i ) =\n\nallY\njets\n\nPoisson[Nev (k b\u2212tags), N\u0302ev (k b\u2212tags)]\u00d7Gaussian(\u03b5b , \u03b5 \u0304b , \u03c3\u03b5b )\n\nk=0\n\n(9)\nwhere \u03b5 \u0304b is the experimentally measured value of \u03b5b in a b jet enriched sample (see Sec. 3) and \u03c3\u03b5b is the corresponding uncertainty. This Gaussian extra\nterm makes the fit more robust, as it takes into account the proper uncertainty associated to \u03b5b . The final result obtained is compatible with MC truth:\nC\n\u03b4\u03b5b =< \u03b5b > \u2212\u03b5M\n=0.005 \u00b1 0.01 and \u03b4R =< R > \u2212RM C =-0.004 \u00b1 0.02.\nb\nTable 4 summarizes how the variation of the different parameters affects the\nmeasurement of \u03b5b and R in the different channels. The initial uncertainty on\nthe knowledge of \u03b5b is reduced by performing the proposed method. This result\nis particularly interesting given the fact that throughout this manuscript we\nhave considered a sample corresponding to 100 pb\u22121 . Increased statistics and\nthe knowledge of the detectors, together with additional inputs from other tt\u0304\nchannels will certainly reduce the total uncertainty in the measurement of this\nquantity.\nTable 4: Variations of R and \u03b5b in the e\u03bc and ee/\u03bc\u03bc channels when an iterative\nprocedure is used to measure this quantities simultaneously (see text).\nSample\nParameter\n\u03b5b (10%)\n\u03b5q (3%)\nmass cut for \u03b1 (5%)\nJES (10%)\nLES (1%)\n\nee/\u03bc\u03bc\n\u03b5b\n\n+0.004\n\u22120.003\n+0.003\n\u22120.001\n+0.004\n\u22120.004\n+0.003\n\u22120.003\n+0.0007\n\u22120.001\n\n+0.003\n\u22120.003\n+0.005\n\u22120.005\n+0.001\n\u22120.001\n+0.005\n\u22120.005\n+0.003\n\u22120.004\n\n+0.007\n\u22120.006\n\nTotal systematic\n\n3.6\n\ne\u03bc\nR\n\n+0.008\n\u22120.009\n\nCross section measurement\n\nAs stated in Sec. 3.4 it is possible to extend the method of measuring R to\nincorporate a simultaneous measurement of the cross section.

The\ndetermination of both A, \u03b5 and L is beyond the scope of this manuscript and it\nis therefore assumed in what follows. Details can be looked elsewhere [16, 18].\nOn the other hand Ntt\u0304 dileptons can be computed using the quantities found in\nthe previous sections, and can be parametrized as follows:\n\u03c3=\n\nNtt\u0304\n\ndileptons\n\n= (1 \u2212 \u03b10 ) * Nevents \u2212 Nsingle top \u2212 Nother\n\ntt\u0304\n\n(11)\n\nwhere \u03b10 is the probability that no jets from top decays have been reconstructed and selected in the final sample. By combining Eq. 10 and Eq. 11 it is\ntrivial to parametrize \u03b10 as a function of \u03c3. It is therefore possible to use this\nparametrization as an input to the likelihood function in Eq. 5, and to leave both\nR and \u03c3 to float freely when fitting the b-tagging multiplicity distribution. The\nresult of this combined fit is shown in Fig. 5 and it is compared with the MC input given for both R and \u03c3. The result is shown in a detector-independent way,\ni.e., factorizing the acceptance and efficiencies in the measurement of \u03c3. A good\nagreement is found between the results of the method and the MC expectations,\nwithin the statistical uncertainty of the sample used for this study.\n\nFigure 5: Combined fit results for R and \u03c3 using the full dilepton sample.\nContour plots (1\u03c3, 2\u03c3 and 3\u03c3) for the likelihood obtained by floating R and \u03c3\nare shown. In the MC, R =1, \u03c3 =414 pb.\n\nThe discussion on the robustness of the combined measurement is similar\nto the discussions carried through Secs. 3.3 and 3.4. A more detailed study on\nthe final uncertainty on the measurement of the cross section would, however,\n\n15\n\n\frequire full detector simulation and estimation on the acceptance and efficiency\nof detecting tt\u0304 dilepton events which is out of the scope of this manuscript.\n\n4\n\nConclusions\n\nThe physics of the top quark sector is one of the current topics of great interest to\nstudy at the LHC. The scale of the mass of the top quark is set at approximately\nthe electroweak symmetry breaking scale, and according to several BSM models\nthe preferential coupling may mainly occur through the top quark sector. In\nthis context, the accurate measurement of the top quark properties is crucial to\nlook for evidence of BSM physics at the LHC.\nIn this manuscript, a discussion on the measurement of the heavy flavor\ncontent of tt\u0304 decays was presented. A specific proposal was suggested to use a\nlikelihood method to fit the b-tagging multiplicity distribution, based on quantities which can be measured directly from data in order to minimize the reliance\non MC simulation. The method is expected to improve the current measurement\nof R, the ratio of branching fractions of the top quark R = B(t \u2192 W b)/B(t \u2192\nW q), and it can be extended to measure simultaneously also the production\ncross section of tt\u0304 events.\nFor illustration, samples of tt\u0304 dilepton events together with the main backgrounds were used. It was shown that a simple kinematical variable, such as\nthe lepton-jet invariant mass, can be used to distinguish signal and background\nevents. A reliable modeling of the background can be achieved without the use\nof MC samples, and can be instead directly derived from data. By using an\niterative method, in which part of the unknown variables are measured in one\nsub-sample and another (i.e. R) is measured in the complementary sample, the\nsystematic uncertainties can be controlled. Keeping in mind that a more accurate determination of the systematic uncertainty requires measurements from\ndata and comparison with full detector simulation which were not used in this\nmanuscript, the results here shown are, however, expected to hold. The case was\nstudied for a number of tt\u0304 events\u221awhich is comparable to an equivalent integrated\nluminosity of L =100 pb\u22121 at s=10 TeV. The measurement of R is expected\nto be mostly statistically dominated with an uncertainty of \u2248 2%. Using the\nmeasurements obtained from other tt\u0304 channels, namely the \"lepton+jets\" channel, and in different control regions, namely different jet multiplicity bins in the\nsame tt\u0304 channel, the systematical uncertainties are expected to cancel out, or\nto be largely reduced. A measurement of R sensitive to deviations from the SM\nseems possible with early data at the LHC.\n\nAknowledgements\nThe authors wish to aknowledge Claudio Campagnari, Tim Christiansen\nand Jo\u00e3o Varela for the useful discussions throughout the preparation of the\nwork presented in this manuscript.
