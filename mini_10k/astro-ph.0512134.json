As a\nfew examples, the magnetic Prandtl number in the solar\nconvective region is estimated to be PM \u2248 10\u22125 \u2212 10\u22126\n[1], and in the Earth's core PM \u2248 10\u22125 . Liquid sodium\nexperiments are also characterized by small values of PM .\nWhile numerical simulations of dynamo action in these\nobjects are available, the large values of the kinetic (RV )\nand magnetic (RM ) Reynolds numbers forbid a study using realistic values of PM . Simulations of the geodynamo\n[2] or the solar convective region [3] are often done for\nPM \u223c 1. While the proper separation of the kinetic and\nmagnetic dissipation scales cannot be achieved in these\nsimulations, values of PM much smaller than one can be\nreached under more idealized conditions. Pseudospectral methods in periodic boxes give an excellent tool to\nstudy the behavior of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence in the regime PM < 1. The further assumption\nof incompressibility allows for an extra gain in computer\npower. Paralellized pseudospectral codes have reached\nfor hydrodynamic turbulence resolutions of 40963 grid\npoints, and Taylor Reynolds numbers of R\u03bb \u2248 1200 [4].\nThese methods are conservative and nondispersive, being well suited for the exploration of turbulent flows in\nregimes hard to explore in the laboratory. And under\nsome circumstances, the range of values of PM can be\nextended using subgrid scale (SGS) models.\nIn this work, we review recent results from simulations\nof helical and non-helical dynamos at PM < 1 using pseudospectral codes in periodic boxes [5, 6, 7]. To extend\nthe range in PM in the simulations, SGS models were\nused in these works. We discuss some of these mod-\n\nels with particular emphasis in the Lagrangian Average\nMHD (LAMHD) equations [8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. In addition,\nand to validate results from SGS models, new results\nfrom direct numerical simulations (DNS) with resolutions\nof 10243 grid points are presented.\nWe focus on the properties of the magnetic field in the\nkinematic dynamo regime, when the intensity of the magnetic field is small and the effect of the Lorentz force can\nbe neglected. In particular, we discuss the behavior of the\nthreshold in RM for dynamo action as PM is decreased.\nThat is to say, given a hydrodynamic state and an arbitrary small magnetic perturbation, what is the minimum\nvalue of RM (or maximum value of \u03b7, in some convenient\nset of dimensionless units) to have a dynamo instability\nsuch that the system reaches after a finite time a magnetohydrodynamic steady state. Below this threshold, the\nmagnetic perturbation is damped and the final state of\nthe system is hydrodynamic.\nTwo flows have recently been studied in this context:\nthe flow resulting from Taylor-Green forcing [5, 6], and\nthe result of Roberts forcing [7, 13]. The first case corresponds to a flow with no net helicity that gives large scale\ndynamo action, while the former studies are for a helical\nflow where only small scale dynamo action is permitted\nby introducing mechanical energy in the largest available\nscale. In a different context, for isotropic, homogeneous,\nand delta-correlated in time external forcing, the problem has also been studied in Refs. [14, 15]. In addition to\nreviewing this results, we compare them against new simulations using Arn'old-Childress-Beltrami (ABC) forcing\nwith energy injection at intermediate scales. This is a\nhelical case where large scale magnetic amplification is\nallowed. For this forcing, values of PM down to 5 \u00d7 10\u22123\nare reached. The results obtained for such a low value\nof PM are expected to be of relevance for astrophysical\nand geophysical applications, as well as for laboratory\ndynamos.\n\n\f2\nFor all cases where a large scale flow is present, dynamo\naction is observed to persist at the smallest values of PM\nthat can be reached. Moreover, for values of PM smaller\nthan \u223c 0.1 an independence of the threshold with PM is\nobserved. While for the Taylor-Green (non-helical) forcing and the Roberts forcing (helical, but with magnetic\namplification only at small scales) a sharp increase in the\ncritical parameter is observed before reaching the asymptotic regime, in the ABC case almost no such increase is\nfound.\nThe structure of the paper is as follows. In Sec. II we\npresent the equations, and the several forcing functions\nused. We also describe the code and the SGS models.\nSection III discusses the thresholds for dynamo action for\nthe several flows, and Sec. IV discusses the role played\nby the different scales in the problem. Finally, Sec. V\npresents the conclusions.\nII.\nA.\n\nEQUATIONS\n\nThe MHD equations\n\nIn dimensionless Alfv\u00e9nic units, the incompressible\nMHD equations are\n\u2202v\n+ v * \u2207v = \u2212\u2207P + j \u00d7 B + \u03bd\u22072 v + f , (1)\n\u2202t\n\u2202B\n+ v * \u2207B = B * \u2207v + \u03b7\u22072 B,\n(2)\n\u2202t\nwith \u2207 * v = \u2207 * B = 0. Here v is the velocity field, and\nB is the magnetic field, related to the electric current\ndensity j by j = \u2207 \u00d7 B. P is the normalized pressure-todensity ratio, obtained by solving the Poisson equation\nthat results from taking the divergence of Eq. (1) and\nusing the condition \u2207 * v = 0.\nIn Eq. (1) f is an external force. Since in the incompressible framework we lack the usual energy sources in\nastrophysics and geophysics (e.g. thermal convection),\nwe will set f to generate a large scale flow, and let the\ninstabilities of the flow generate turbulent fluctuations.\nThe expressions for f considered are discussed in the following subsection.\nEquations (1) and (2) are solved using a standard pseudospectral method [16, 17] in a three dimensional periodic box. The code uses projection into the Fourier base\nto compute spatial derivatives, and Runge-Kutta of adjustable order to evolve the equations in time. The 2/3rule for dealiasing is used. As a result, if N grid points\nare used in each direction, the maximum wavenumber\nsolved by the code is kmax = N/3. To make use of parallel computers, the three dimensional Fourier transform\nhas to be parallelized efficiently, using a methodology as\ndescribed e.g. in Refs. [18, 19].\nAll Reynolds numbers discussed are based on the flow\nintegral scale\nZ\nL = 2\u03c0 EV (k)k \u22121 dk/EV\n(3)\n\nRwhere EV (k) is the kinetic energy spectrum, and EV =\nEV (k)dk is the total kinetic energy. Given the r.m.s.\nvelocity U , the kinetic Reynolds number is RV = LU/\u03bd\nand the magnetic Reynolds number is RM = LU/\u03b7. The\nmagnetic Prandtl number is PM = RM /RV . We also\ndefine the large scale eddy turnover time as T = L/U .\nThe kinetic and magnetic dissipation wavenumbers in\nthe turbulent regime are given by k\u03bd = (\u01eb/\u03bd 3 )1/4 and\nk\u03b7 = (\u01eb/\u03b7 3 )1/4 respectively, where \u01eb is the energy injection rate. In all simulations, these wavenumbers were\nsmaller than the maximum resolved wavenumber kmax .\nThe strategy is to turn on the forcing at t = 0 and allow\nthe code to run for a time as a hydrodynamic code, with\nthe magnetic field set to zero. Once a stationary state\nis reached, the magnetic field is seeded with randomlychosen Fourier coefficients and allowed to amplify or decay.\n\nB.\n\nExternal forcing\n\nSeveral expressions for the external forcing were studied in the context of dynamo action. Refs. [5, 6] considered Taylor-Green [20] forcing\nfTG = [sin(kTG x) cos(kTG y) cos(kTG z)x\u0302\u2212\n\u2212 cos(kTG x) sin(kTG y) cos(kTG z)\u0177] ,\n\n(4)\n\nwith wavenumber kTG = 2 (this election gives a peak in\nthe kinetic energy at k \u2248 3). If Eq. (4) is used as an initial condition for the velocity field v, it is found that the\nflow is not a solution of the Euler's equation and though\nhighly symmetric, it leads to the rapid development of\nsmall spatial scales. The forcing is also non-helical, in\nthe sense that fTG * \u2207 \u00d7 fTG is zero at every point in\nspace. Helical fluctuations can however appear at scales\nsmaller than the forcing scale.\nRef. [7, 13] considered the Roberts flow [21, 22] as the\nexpression for the external force f :\nfR = [g sin(kR x) cos(kR y)x\u0302 \u2212 g cos(kR x) sin(kR y)\u0177+\n+2f sin(kR x) sin(kR y)\u1e91] ,\n(5)\nwith the choice kR = 1. Since in that case mechanical\nenergy is injected in the largest available scale, magnetic\nexcitations can only grow at scales smaller than the energy injection scale. The coefficients f and g are arbitrary\nand their ratio determines the extent to which the flow\nexcited will be helical. We will concentrate here upon\nthe case f = g. In this case, the forcing injects helicity\nin the flow, although not maximally. If used as an initial\ncondition, the velocity field is an exact solution of Euler's\nequation. As a result, the development of small scale fluctuations only takes place above a certain threshold in the\nkinetic Reynolds number RV . For values of RV smaller\nthan this threshold, there is an exact laminar solution of\n2\nthe hydrodynamic equations given by v = f /(\u03bdkR\n).\n\n\f3\nWe compare the results from these two forcing functions with the ABC forcing\nfABC = {[B cos(kABC y) + C sin(kABC z)] x\u0302+\n+ [A sin(kABC x) + C cos(kABC z)] \u0177 +\n+ [A cos(kABC x) + B sin(kABC y)] \u1e91} ,\n\n\u2202v\n+ us * \u2207v = \u2212vj \u2207ujs \u2212 \u2207Pe + j \u00d7 Bs\n\u2202t\n+\u03bd\u22072 v + f ,\n\u2202Bs\n+ us * \u2207Bs = Bs * \u2207us + \u03b7\u22072 B..\n\u2202t\n\n(6)\n\nwith kABC = 3, and A = 0.9, B = 1, and C = 1.1.\nPrevious results for PM < 1 have been reported in Refs.\n[23, 24], although no systematic study of the effect of\nlowering PM was done.\nThe ABC flow is maximally helical, and the election of\nkABC allows for the growth of magnetic energy at scales\nlarger than the energy injection scale. As for the Roberts\nflow, the ABC flow is also an exact solution of the Euler's equation, and turbulent fluctuations are generated\nas the result of a hydrodynamic instability at values of\nRV larger than a certain threshold. The particular election of the parameters A, B, and C is done to break the\nsymmetry of the flow and reduce the value of the hydrodynamic threshold [24, 25].\n\nC.\n\nincompressible case, the LAMHD equations are\n\nSubgrid models of MHD turbulence\n\nAs the value of PM is lowered down, the separation between the Ohmic and viscous dissipation scales increases.\nAs a result, the velocity field has more small scale structure than the magnetic field. This imposes a stringent\nlimit on the smallest PM that can be reached using DNS.\nAt some point, the small scales in the flow cannot be\nsolved anymore, and some form of SGS modeling is required.\nWhile SGS models of hydrodynamic turbulence have\na rich history, models for MHD flows are still in their\ninfancy (see e.g. [26]). One of the main difficulties in\nMHD is that hypotheses often made in hydrodynamics\n(e.g. locality of interactions in Fourier space) are not necessarily true for magnetofluids. The general expression\nof the MHD energy spectrum is not known. And several\nregimes can be expected according to whether the system is mechanically or magnetically forced, whether the\nfields are statistically aligned or not, etc.\nIn this work we will focus on the LAMHD equations\n(or MHD \u03b1-model). The hydrodynamic \u03b1-model (see e.g\n[8, 9] and references therein) was validated against simulations in Ref. [27]. It differs from large eddy simulations\n(LES) in that the filter is applied to the Lagrangian of\nthe ideal fluid, and as a result Hamiltonian properties\nof the system are preserved. It was extended to ideal\nMHD [8, 9], and tested against DNS of MHD turbulence [11, 12]. In the context of magnetoconvection, the\nLAMHD equations were also studied in Ref. [28]. In the\n\n(7)\n(8)\n\nThe pressure Pe is to be determined, as before, from the\nrelevant Poisson\nR equation. The energy in this system is\ngiven by E = (v * us + B * Bs )/2 d3 x. The subindex s\ndenotes smoothed fields, related to the unsmoothed fields\nby\n\u0001\n(9)\nv = 1 \u2212 \u03b12 \u22072 us\n\u0001\n2 2\n(10)\nB = 1 \u2212 \u03b1 \u2207 Bs .\n\nIn the context of the dynamo at low PM , some others\nSGS models have been used. Ref. [5] used a modified\nLES [29] where only the velocity field at scales smaller\nthan the magnetic diffusion scale was modeled using a\nturbulent effective viscosity dependent on the wavenumber. A similar SGS model has been used in Ref. [15] to\nstudy dynamo action with delta-correlated in time random forcing, but with the expression of the effective viscosity based on the Smagorinsky-Lilly model. Ref. [15]\nalso used hyperviscosity, although it should be remarked\nthat this method is known to give wrong growth rates for\nthe magnetic energy in the anisotropic case [30].\nIII.\n\nBEHAVIOR OF THE DYNAMO WITH PM\n\nFigure 1 (bottom panel) shows the critical magnetic\nc\nReynolds number RM\nas a function of RV for TaylorGreen forcing. Crosses connected with solid lines are\nobtained using DNS, while crosses connected with dotted\nlines are from LAMHD simulations (the largest resolution\nused by each method was of 5123 grid points). An overlap\nof the two methods for three values of RV was used to\nverify the SGS model. In Ref. [5] higher values of RV\nwere reached for this flow using LES.\nAbove the threshold, magnetic field excitations are amplified exponentially until the system reaches a fully developed MHD regime. Below the threshold, magnetic\nfield perturbations are damped and the system reaches\nafter long times a hydrodynamic regime.\nThe threshold is obtained from simulations in the following way: in the steady state of a hydrodynamic simulation at a given value of RV , a small magnetic field is\nintroduced and several simulations varying RM are carried. In each MHD simulation, the exponential growth\nor decay rate \u03c3 = d log EM /dt of the magnetic energy is\nc\n.\nmeasured. The value of RM for which \u03c3 = 0 defines RM\nc\nis bounded between two values of RM\nIn practice, RM\nthat give positive and negative \u03c3, and the actual value\nc\nis obtained from a best fit to the \u03c3 vs. RM curve\nof RM\n(see e.g. Refs. [5, 6]). This procedure gives the value of\nc\nwith an error of the order of 10%.\nRM\n\n\f4\n\nFIG. 1: Integral lengthscale of the flow as a function of RV\n(above), and critical magnetic Reynolds for dynamo action\nc\nRM\nas a function of RV (below) for the Taylor-Green forcing.\nCrosses connected with solid lines are obtained from DNS,\nwhile crosses connected with dotted lines are obtained using\nthe LAMHD equations.\n\nFigure 1 (top panel) also shows the flow integral scale\nas RV is increased. This scale is measured in the steady\nstate of the hydrodynamic run that preceeds the MHD\nsimulations. At low RV the flow is laminar and L is\nclose to the forcing scale 2\u03c0/kTG . However, as RV is\nincreased, more and more small scale excitations appear\nin the flow, and L decreases. For RV \u2248 1000, the system\nhas reached a fully turbulent regime with a Kolmogorov's\nenergy spectrum. For larger values of RV , L changes\nc\nslowly. Note that RM\nis anti-correlated with L. As RV\nc\nincreases, RM grows sharply. But for RV \u2248 1000 (PM \u2248\nc\n0.3) the threshold in RM\nsettles around 300, and the\nsystem seems to reach an asymptotic regime.\nThe same quantities are shown in Fig. 2 for the\nRoberts forcing (see also Ref. [7]). In this case, the\nexternal forcing is an exact solution of the Euler's equation, and for RV . 100 the flow is hydrodynamically\nstable. Between RV \u2248 100 and RV \u2248 1000 the flow\ndisplays hydrodynamic oscillations, and for RV & 1000\nthe flow reaches a hydrodynamic turbulent regime with a\nKolmogorov's power law in the inertial range. As a result\nof these instabilities, the characteristic scale of the flow\nchanges twice sharply. In the laminar regime L \u2248 2\u03c0/kR .\nThen L decreases and remains approximately constant in\nthe oscillatory regime (400 . RV . 1000), and finally has\na second sharp decrease (RV \u2248 1000) as turbulence develops. The threshold for dynamo action shows again an\nc\nanti-correlation with L, and two sharp increases in RM\nas a function of RV are observed as L changes. In the\nturbulent regime (RV \u2248 1000), an asymptotic value of\nc\nRM\nseems again to be reached. In this case, only DNS\n\nFIG. 2: Integral lengthscale of the flow as a function of RV\nc\n(above), and RM\nas a function of RV (below) for Roberts\nforcing.\n\nFIG. 3: Integral lengthscale of the flow as a function of RV\nc\n(above), and RM\nas a function of RV (below) for ABC forcing.\nCrosses connected with solid lines are obtained from DNS,\nwhile crosses connected with dotted lines are obtained using\nthe LAMHD equations.\n\nwas used.\nFigure 3 shows the threshold and integral scale as a\nfunction of RV for ABC forcing. As mentioned in the\nprevious section, this is a helical flow with energy injection at intermediate scales, and as a result large scale dynamo action can take place. As for Taylor-Green forcing,\ncrosses connected with solid lines are obtained from DNS,\nwhile crosses connected with dotted lines are obtained\nfrom LAMHD simulations. There is an anti-correlation\n\n\f5\n\nFIG. 5: Spectrum of kinetic energy (thick line) and magnetic\nenergy (thin line) in a 10243 simulation with Taylor-Green\nforcing (PM = 0.1 and RM = 400). The spectrum of magnetic energy has been multiplied by 10. Kolmogorov's and\nKazanstsev's power laws are shown as a reference.\n\nFIG. 4: Volume render of enstrophy density (above) and\nsquare current density (below) in a small region of a simulation with PM = 5 \u00d7 10\u22122 and ABC forcing.\n\nbetween L and RV , but it is less clear than in the previous flows. In the laminar case (RV \u2248 10) the integral\nscale is close to 2\u03c0/kABC , while in the turbulent regime\nc\n(RV \u2248 1000) RM\nis larger and L is smaller. However,\nthere is an intermediate range where L grows together\nc\nwith RM\n. The increase of L in this intermediate regime\nis associated with the development of chaotic trajectories\nconnecting several ABC cells as the flow bifurcates. The\nhydrodynamic bifurcations and subsequent generation of\nsmall scales (breaking the infinite time correlation of the\nlaminar flow) also gives rise to an enhanced diffusivity\nc\nthat in turns increases RM\n.\nWhen compared with the previous flows, there are two\nc\nstriking differences in the amplitude of RM\nas a function\nof RV . First, the thresholds at high RV are reduced by\none order of magnitude. Second, there is only a small dec\npendence of RM\nwith RV . As the flow destabilizes and\ndevelops turbulence (RV \u2248 100) the threshold changes\nc\nc\nfrom RM\n\u2248 10 to RM\n\u2248 20, while in the previously discussed flows the increase is by a factor of 10. After that,\nc\nRM\ndrops and finally stabilizes. Note that the smallest\nmagnetic Prandtl number of PM \u2248 5 \u00d7 10\u22123 was reached\nfor this flow.\nFigure 4 shows renders of the enstrophy density and\nmean square current in a small box in a DNS using ABC\nforcing and PM = 5 \u00d7 10\u22122 . The scale separation between the kinetic and magnetic diffusion scales is evident.\nWhile the velocity field displays thin and elongated vortex tubes, the structures in the magnetic field are thicker.\n\nIn simulations without large scale flows [14, 15] no\nasymptotic regime for low PM has been found so far.\nAs RV is increased and the system develops turbulent\nc\nfluctuations, RM\ngrows to values much larger than the\nones obtained here. From the numerical results, it is\nnot clear whether an asymptotic regime will be reached\nc\nor RM\nwill continue growing. However, theoretical arguc\nments [31] suggest that RM\nshould be constant for values\nof RV large enough. From the comparison with the cases\nstudied here and the anti-correlation found between L\nc\nand RM\n, it is clear that the presence of a large scale flow\n(helical or not) plays a crucial role in the development\nof the asymptotic regime at relatively small values of RV\nand RM .\n\nIV.\n\nSCALE INTERACTIONS\n\nThe results presented in the previous section raise the\nquestion of what are the effects of turbulence, beyond\nc\nincreasing the value of RM\n. Does dynamo action only\ntake place at large scales when PM < 1, or can turbulent\nfluctuations also amplify small scale magnetic fields? By\nsmall scales, we refer here to scales smaller than the flow\nintegral scale but larger than the magnetic diffusion scale.\nFigure 5 shows the kinetic and magnetic energy spectrum in the kinematic regime of a 10243 DNS using\nTaylor-Green forcing (PM = 0.1 and RM = 400). The\nmagnetic energy spectrum peaks at scales smaller than\nthe flow integral scale, and at intermediate scales the\nspectrum is approximately flat. At large scales, a slope\ncompatible with Kazantsev's spectrum [32] is observed,\nalthough it should be noted that the hypothesis used by\nKazantsev do not apply to this case. In Ref. [5] it was\nshown that the peak in the magnetic energy spectrum\nmoves to small scales as RV is increased.\nThe role played by the different scales in the flow is further clarified by examining the energy transfer functions.\n\n\f6\n\nFIG. 6: Transfer functions \u2212TL (k) (solid line) and TM (k)\n(dashed line) in the 10243 simulation with Taylor-Green forcing.\n\nFrom Eqs. (1) and (2), the transfers\nZ\n\u0010\n\u0011\nbk\u2217 * j\\\n\u00d7 B d\u03a9k ,\nTL (k) = v\nk\n\nTM (k) =\n\nZ\n\n\u0010\n\u0011\nb \u2217 * \u2207 \u00d7 v\\\nB\n\u00d7\nB\nd\u03a9k ,\nk\nk\n\n(11)\n\n(12)\n\ncan be defined (see e.g. Ref. [6]). The asterisk denotes complex conjugate, the hat Fourier transform,\nthe subindex denotes the amplitude of the mode with\nwavevector k, and d\u03a9k is the element of surface of the\nsphere of radius k in Fourier space. When negative,\nTL (k) represents energy given by the velocity field at the\nwavenumber k to the magnetic field at all scales. Positive\nTM (k) represents energy received by the magnetic field\nat wavenumber k from the velocity field at all scales, and\nfrom the direct cascade of energy. The detailed shell-toshell energy transfer in the kinematic dynamo has been\nstudied in Ref. [33].\nFigure 6 shows the transfer functions for the 10243\nDNS with Taylor-Green forcing. The magnetic field receives energy from the velocity field in all scales in the\ninertial range (note that TL has constant amplitude from\nk \u2248 3 up to k \u2248 40). As a result, for this forcing both\nthe large scale flow and the turbulent fluctuations give\nenergy to the magnetic field. On the other hand, TM (k)\npeaks at k \u2248 60. This suggests that the dynamo process is non-local in Fourier space. Other indications of\nnon-local interactions from simulations were obtained in\nRef. [34], and in simulations of dynamo action at large\nPM [35], although direct verification of the nonlocality in\nMHD turbulence was not obtained until recently [36, 37].\nSimilar results were obtained for Roberts forcing [7]. In\nthat case, a magnetic energy spectrum peaking at small\nscales and an approximately flat TL (k) transfer function\nat small scales were observed.\nThe results for ABC forcing are different. Figure 7\nshows the kinetic and magnetic energy spectrum in a 5123\nDNS with PM = 1.5 \u00d7 10\u22122 and RM = 40. In this case,\n\nFIG. 7: Spectrum of kinetic energy (thick line) and magnetic energy (thin line) in a 5123 simulation with ABC forcing\n(PM = 1.5 \u00d7 10\u22122 and RM = 40). The spectrum of magnetic\nenergy has been multiplied by 10.\n\nthe magnetic energy spectrum peaks at k = 1, and no\npeak is observed at scales smaller than the integral scale\nof the flow. Moreover, the magnetic energy spectrum\ndrops fast. The transfer TL (k) (Fig. 8) shows that most\nof the amplification is done by the large scale flow at\nk = 3, and the turbulent fluctuations seem to give only\na small contribution to the dynamo. TM (k) shows that\nmost of the energy is received by the magnetic field at\nlarge scales, and it drops as TL (k) at small scales.\nThe reason for this behavior can be understood as folc\nlows. For ABC forcing, RM\nis of the order of a few tens,\neven in the fully turbulent regime. As a result, a dynamo\nsimulation just above threshold has small RM , and small\nmagnetic scales are damped so fast that no inertial range\ncan develop in the magnetic energy spectrum. As a result, the magnetic field is only amplified by the large scale\nflow and grows at larger scales. Since there is no dynamo\nsource at scales smaller than the flow integral scale, the\nsmall scales are only fed by the direct cascade of energy\nand the magnetic energy spectrum cannot peak at these\nscales.\nHowever, if a simulation using ABC forcing is done at\nlarger values of RM , dynamo amplification by the small\nscales is recovered and similar features than for TaylorGreen forcing are obtained [23, 33]. This situation should\nbe the one that prevails in astrophysics.\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nWe reviewed results of dynamo action at low magnetic\nPrandtl number [5, 6, 7] for several mechanical forcing\nfunctions, including helical and non-helical flows, as well\nas small and large scale dynamo action. For all cases\nwhere a large scale flow is present, a similar behavior is\nobtained in the threshold for dynamo action: as RV is\nc\nincreased (or PM decreased), the value of RM\nincreases\nsharply as turbulence develops and finally reaches an\nasymptotic regime independent of the value of PM . The\n\n\f7\n\nFIG. 8: Transfer functions \u2212TL (k) (solid line) and TM (k)\n(dashed line) in the 5123 simulation with ABC forcing.\n\nlarge scale flow plays an important role in the establishment of the asymptotic behavior, as shown by the anticorrelation between the characteristic length of the flow\nc\nand RM\n. As turbulence develops, the laminar flow creates small scales through hydrodynamic instabilities, and\nthe large scale laminar flow loses its infinite correlation\ntime. Then, both the large and small scale velocity fields\namplify the magnetic field, giving rise to the asymptotic\nregime.\nNew results from simulations with ABC forcing present\na distinctive behavior.
