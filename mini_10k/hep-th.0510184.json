These corrections stem from the generalized uncertainty principle. In the absence of a cosmic string our\nresult here is in agreement with our previous result.\n\nThe gravitational properties of cosmic strings are strikingly different from\nthose of non-relativistic linear distributions of matter. To explain the origin\nof the difference, we note that for a static matter distribution with energymomentum tensor,\nT\u03bd\u03bc\n\np1 p2 p3\n= diag \u03c1, \u2212 2 , \u2212 2 , \u2212 2 ,\nc\nc\nc\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n(1)\n\nthe Newtonian limit of the Einstein equations becomes\np1 + p2 + p3\n\u2207 \u03a6 = 4\u03c0G \u03c1 +\n,\nc2\n2\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03a6 is the gravitational potential. For non-relativistic matter, pi \u226a \u03c1c2\nand \u22072 \u03a6 = 4\u03c0G\u03c1. Strings, on the other hand, have a large longitudinal\ntension. For a straight string parallel to the z-axis, p3 = \u2212\u03c1c2 , with p1 and\np2 vanish when averaged over the string cross-section. Hence, the right-hand\nside of (2) vanishes, suggesting that straight strings produce no gravitational\nforce on surrounding matter. This conclusion is confirmed by a full generalrelativistic analysis. Another feature distinguishing cosmic strings from more\nfamiliar sources is their relativistic motion. As a result, oscillating loops of\nstring can be strong emitters of gravitational radiation.\n1\n\nEmail: nasseri@fastmail.fm\n\n1\n\n\fThe analysis in this letter is based on thin-string and weak-gravity approximations. The metric of a static straight string lying along the z-axis in\ncylindrical coordinates (t, z, \u03c1, \u03c6) is given by2\nds2 = c2 dt2 \u2212 dz 2 \u2212 (1 \u2212 h)(d\u03c12 + \u03c12 d\u03c62),\n\n(3)\n\nwhere G is Newton's gravitational constant, \u03bc the string mass per unit length\nand\n!\n8G\u03bc\n\u03c1\nh = 2 ln\n.\n(4)\nc\n\u03c1\u0302\nIntroducing a new radial coordinate \u03c1\u2032 as\n(1 \u2212 h)\u03c12 = (1 \u2212\nwe obtain to linear order in\n\n8G\u03bc \u20322\n)\u03c1 ,\nc2\n\n(5)\n\nG\u03bc\n,\nc2\n\nds2 = c2 dt2 \u2212 dz 2 \u2212 d\u03c1\u20322 \u2212 (1 \u2212\n\n8G\u03bc \u20322 2\n)\u03c1 d\u03c6 .\nc2\n\n(6)\n\nFinally, with a new angular coordinate\n\u03c6\u2032 = (1 \u2212\n\n4G\u03bc\n)\u03c6,\nc2\n\n(7)\n\nthe metric takes a Minkowskian form\nds2 = c2 dt2 \u2212 dz 2 \u2212 d\u03c1\u20322 \u2212 \u03c1\u20322 d\u03c6\u20322 .\n\n(8)\n\nSo, the geometry around a straight cosmic string is locally identical to that\nof flat spacetime. This geometry, however is not globally Euclidean since the\nangle \u03c6\u2032 varies in the range\n4G\u03bc\n0 \u2264 \u03c6 < 2\u03c0 1 \u2212 2 .\nc\n\u0012\n\n\u2032\n\n\u0013\n\n(9)\n\nHence, the effect of the string is to introduce an azimuthal 'deficit angle'\n\u2206=\n\n8\u03c0G\u03bc\n,\nc2\n\n(10)\n\n2\nWe use the notation (t, z, \u03c1, \u03c6) for cylindrical coordinates and (t, r, \u03b8, \u03c6) for spherical\ncoordinates. Here the mks units have been used.\n\n2\n\n\fimplying that a surface of constant t and z has the geometry of a cone rather\nthan that of a plane [1].\nAs shown above, the metric (6) can be transformed to a flat metric (8)\nso there is no gravitational potential in the space outside the string. But\nthere is a delta-function curvature at the core of the cosmic string which has\na global effect-the deficit angle (10).\nThe dimensionless parameter G\u03bc\nplays an important role in the physics of\nc2\ncosmic strings. In the weak-field approximation G\u03bc\n\u226a 1. The string scenario\nc2\nG\u03bc\n\u22126\nto\nfor galaxy formation requires c2 \u223c 10 while observations constrain G\u03bc\nc2\n\u22125\nbe less than 10 [1].\nLinet in [2] has shown that the electrostatic field of a charged particle is\ndistorted by the cosmic string. For a test charged particle in the presence of\na cosmic string the electrostatic self-force is repulsive and is perpendicular\nto the cosmic string lying along the z-axis3\nf\u03c1 \u2243\n\n\u03c0 G\u03bc e2\n,\n4 c2 4\u03c0\u01eb0 \u03c120\n\n(11)\n\nwhere f \u03c1 is the component of the electrostatic self-forcs along the \u03c1-axis in\ncylindrical coordinates and \u03c10 is the distance between the electron and the\ncosmic string.\nFor the Bohr's atom in the absence of a cosmic string, the electrostatic\nforce between an electron and a proton is given by Coulomb law\n\u2212e2\nF~ =\nr\u0302.\n4\u03c0\u01eb0 r 2\n\n(12)\n\nAs discussed in [3, 4, 5], to obtain the fine structure constant in the\nspacetime of a cosmic string we assume that the proton located on the cosmic\nstring lying along the z-axis. We also assume that the proton located in the\norigin of the cylindrical coordinates and the electron located at \u03c1 = \u03c10 , z = 0\n3\nLinet in [2] has used the mks units and in Eqs.(15) and (16) of [2] has obtained\nf z = f \u03c6 = 0 and\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\nG\u03bc\nq2\n2.5\n\u03c1\nf \u223c\n\u03c0\nc2\n4\u03c0\u01eb0 \u03c120\n\nwhen \u03bc \u2192 0. Indeed we can put the fraction 2.5\n\u03c0 to be approximately equal to\nthis substitution we obtain (11) of this article.\n\n3\n\n\u03c0\n4.\n\nWith\n\n\fand \u03c6 = 0. This means that the electron and the proton are in the plane\northogonal to the cosmic string.\nTo calculate the Bohr radius in the spacetime of a cosmic string we consider a Bohr's atom in the presence of a cosmic string. For a Bohr's atom\nin the spacetime of a cosmic string, we take into account the sum of two\nforces, i.e. the electrostatice force for Bohr's atom in the absence of a cosmic\nstring, given by Eq.(12), plus the electrostatic self-force of the electron in the\npresence of a cosmic string. Because we assume that the proton located at\nthe origin of the cylindrical coordinates and on the cosmic string and also the\nplane of electron and proton is perpendicular to the cosmic string lying along\nthe z-axis, the induced electrostatic self-force and the Coulomb force are at\nthe same direction, i.e. the direction of the \u03c1-axis in cylindrical coordinates.\nTherefore, we can sum these two forces\nF~tot = \u2212\n\n!\n\n\u03c0 G\u03bc e2\ne2\n+\n\u03c1\u0302.\n4\u03c0\u01eb0 \u03c120\n4 c2 4\u03c0\u01eb0 \u03c120\n\n(13)\n\nIt can be easily shown that this force has negative value and is an attractive\nforce ( \u03c0G\u03bc\n< 1).\n4c2\nThe numerical value of Bohr radius in the spacetime of a cosmic string\ncan be computed by (13).

In the case \u03b2\u0302 = 0, (24) reads the standard Heisenberg\nuncertainty principle\n\u2206xi \u2206pj \u2265 h\u0304\u03b4ij ,\n\ni, j = 1, 2, 3.\n\n(25)\n\nThere are many derivations of the generalized uncertainty principle, some\nheuristic and some more rigorous. Eq.(24) can be derived in the context of\nstring theory and noncommutative quantum mechanics. The exact value of\n\u03b2\u0302 depends on the specific model. The second term in the right-hand side of\n(24) becomes effective when momentum and length scales are of the order of\nthe Planck mass and of the Planck length, respectively. This limit is usually\ncalled quantum regime. From (24) we solve for the momentum uncertainty\nin terms of the distance uncertainty, which we again take to be the radius\nof the first Bohr orbit. Therefore we are led to the following momentum\nuncertainty\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nv\nu\n\u2206pi\n\u2206xi \uf8ec\n4\u03b2\u0302 2 L2P \uf8f7\nt\n=\n\uf8ed1 \u2212 1 \u2212\n\uf8f8.\nh\u0304\n\u2206x2i\n2\u03b2\u0302 2 L2P\nu\n\n(26)\n\nThe maximum uncertainty in the position of an electron in the ground state\nin hydrogen atom is equal to the radius of the first Bohr radius, aB . In the\nspacetime of a cosmic string, the maximum uncertainty in the position of an\nelectron in the ground state is equal to the modified radius of the first Bohr\nradius, \u00e2B , see (21).\nRecalling the standard uncertainty principle \u2206xi \u2206pi \u2265 h\u0304, we define an\n\"effective\" Planck constant \u2206xi \u2206pi \u2265 h\u0304eff .
