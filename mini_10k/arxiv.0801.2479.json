The cavity also has a typical lifetime \u03c4 , which results in a finite\nlinewidth \u03b4f. If the size of the cavity is changed fast compared to \u03c4 , and so that the frequency\nchange \u2206f \u226b \u03b4f, then it is possible to change the \"colour\" of the captured photons. Here we\ndemonstrate superconducting microwave cavities, with tunable effective lengths. The tuning is\nobtained by varying a Josephson inductance at one end of the cavity. We show tuning by several\nhundred linewidths in a time \u2206t \u226a \u03c4 . Working in the few photon limit, we show that photons stored\nin the cavity at one frequency will leak out from the cavity with the new frequency after the detuning. The characteristics of the measured devices make them suitable for dynamic coupling of qubits.\nSuperconducting transmission line resonators are useful in a number of applications ranging from X-ray photon\ndetectors [1] to parametric amplifiers [2] and quantum computation applications [3, 4, 5]. Very recently, there has\nbeen a lot of interest in tunable superconducting resonators [6, 7, 8]. In these experiments the inductive properties\nof the Josephson junction is implemented as a tunable element and is tuned by a bias current or a magnetic field.\nThese devices have both large tuning ranges and high quality factors, however the speed at which these devices can\nbe tuned has not been measured.\nThe interaction between a qubit and superconducting coplanar waveguide (CPW) resonator can, due to the small\nmode volume, be very strong when they are resonant with each other [9]. However, the interaction can be modulated,\nbecoming weak when the qubit and the cavity are off-resonance. Taking this into account, a protocol for a controlled\nphase gate using two superconducting qubits and a tunable resonator was constructed by Wallquist et al. [10]. The\nadvantage of using a tunable resonator for qubit interaction compared to a fixed resonator and tunable qubits is that\nthe qubits can stay at their optimal points [11] during operation. Although a qubit design has been presented that is\ninsensitive to charge noise [12], there is still an optimal point in the flux direction which may be essential to obtaining\nlong coherence times. To implement the protocol suggested by Wallquist et al., a CPW resonator with a large tuning\nrange, fast tuning and high quality factor is needed. We have fabricated a quarter wavelength (\u03bb/4) CPW resonator\nterminated to ground via one or several Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices (SQUIDs) in series (see Fig.\n1(a)). In the other end of the resonator, a small coupling capacitance is placed through which the resonator can be\nexcited and probed using microwave reflectometry.\nA SQUID can be viewed as a lumped element inductor with the nonlinear inductance\nLs =\n4\u03c0Ic | cos(\u03c0\u03a6/\u03a60 )|\n\n\u03a60\nr\n\n1\u2212\n\n\u0010\n\nI\n2Ic cos(\u03c0\u03a6/\u03a60 )\n\n\u00112\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03a6 is the applied magnetic flux, \u03a60 = ~/2e is the magnetic flux quantum, Ic is the critical current of each\nSQUID junction and I is the current through the SQUID. The inductance can be varied by applying a magnetic field\nor a bias current. When the current I is much smaller than the suppressed critical current, Ls can be considered\nlinear. A real SQUID has also a capacitance Cs and the subgap resistance Rs in parallel with the inductance so that\nthe total impedance of the SQUIDs is\nZs = N\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: martins@chalmers.se\n\n\u0012\n\ni\u03c9Ls Rs\nRs + i\u03c9Ls \u2212 \u03c9 2 Ls Cs Rs\n\n\u0013\n\n(2)\n\n\f2\nwhere N is the number of SQUIDs in series.\nThe resonator circuit can be described using the scattering matrices formulation [13] using three scattering matrixes\nin series.

The parameter \u03b1 is the attenuation along the transmission line and for a non-tunable\n\u03bb/4 resonator \u03b1 = \u03c0/\u03bbQint , where Qint is the internal quality factor of the device. \u03b2 = 2\u03c0/\u03bb, is the phase propagation\nof the transmission line.\nMeasurements of \u0393 on two different devices are presented here. Device A has one SQUID and is tuned by an\nexternal magnetic field, while device B has six SQUIDs in series and is tuned by an on-chip flux bias (see Table I). A\nmicrograph of a device identical to device B is showed in Fig. 1(a). Measurements of the devices were performed at\nthe base temperature (below 20 mK) of a dilution cryostat.

The devices are fabricated on a silicon substrate with a 400 nm layer of wet-grown silicon dioxide. The cavity and\nthe Josephson junctions forming the SQUIDs are fabricated from aluminium in a single lithography step using double angle\nevaporation and oxidation. The center strip is 13 \u03bcm wide and the gaps are 7 \u03bcm, giving a capacitance of 170 pF/m [14]\nand a characteristic impedance of 50 \u03a9. Two devices, A and B, were measured. Device B had two on-chip flux lines to tune\nthe SQUIDs, one for DC bias and one for fast pulses, while device A could only be tuned with an external magnetic field. b,\nSchematic measurement setup. The samples are shielded from external magnetic fields using an outer Pb shield and an inner\ncryoperm shield. The devices are probed through a circulator placed at the base temperature of the dilution refrigerator and\na HEMT amplifier with a noise temperature of 4.5 K [15] located at the 4 K stage. The excitation line has 70 dB of cold\nattentuation before the input port of the circulator. The fast flux line is a 50 \u03a9 through-line going down to the chip and back\nto room temperature with 23 dB of attenuation in both directions. The fast flux line is filtered in both directions with 8 GHz\nlow pass filters at the 600 mK level. The DC line has a 100 MHz low pass filter placed at 4 K. To do fast tuning measurements,\nthe signal from the resonator is mixed with the drive signal.\n\nMeasuring the reflection coefficient as a function of applied magnetic DC field, Fig. 2(b), using a vector network\n\n\f3\na\n\n4\n\nb\n\n2\n\n10\n\nA\nB\n\n1\n1.5\n\nQ\n\n0.8\n\n4.5\n\n1\n4\n\nf [GHz]\n\n|S11 |\n\n0.9\n\n5\n\n0.7\n0.5\n0.6\n0\n4.764 4.766 4.768 4.77 4.772 4.774 4.776 4.778\nf [GHz]\n\n-0.4\n\n-0.2\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\nF/F0\n\nFIG. 2: Microwave reflectometry measurements. a, Magnitude of the reflection spectrum of sample A. The resonance\nfrequency is given by the center of the dip in the spectrum and the Q value is the resonance frequency divided by the full\nwidth at half maximum. From these measurements, we can conclude that the devices are undercoupled i.e. the dominate\nsource of loss is from inside the cavity and not from leakage through the coupling capacitance. The internal losses have four\ncontributions: radiation, resistive losses in the conductor, dielectric losses, and losses in the SQUID. In the CPW design, the\nradiation losses are small. The resistive losses should also be small since the temperature of the device is well below the\ncritical temperature of aluminium and the applied frequency is well below the superconducting gap frequency. The losses must\ntherefore either be due to dielectric losses or due to the SQUIDs. To address this question, a non-tunable reference device\n(without SQUIDs) was fabricated and measured, not shown here. The measurements showed undercoupled behaviour for this\ndevice at low drive powers, suggesting that the SQUIDs are not the limiting factor. As we increased the drive power however,\nthe Q of the reference devices increased and we observed a transition from undercoupled to overcoupled behaviour. The power\ndependence seems to be consistent with what Martinis et al. observed for losses due to two-level fluctuators in the dielectric\n[16]. b, Resonance frequency (green) and Q value (blue) as a function of applied magnetic flux for the two devices A (circles)\nand B (squares). Device A has one SQUID with a critical current of Ic \u2248 1.2 \u03bcA.

N is the number of SQUIDs, Ic is the critical current of the Josephson\njunctions, f0 is the zero flux resonance frequency, \u2206fM ax is the maximum detuning achieved, Q0 is the zero field Q value and\nthe last column states how the flux bias was applied to the SQUID.\n\nanalyzer (VNA) and fitting equation 3 we get \u03b1 \u223c 0.106 dB/m and \u03b2 \u223c 241 rad/m, on resonance, for sample A at\nzero detuning. The value of \u03b2 on resonance gives a cavity electrical length corresponding to 86 degrees, compared to\n90 degrees for a regular \u03bb/4 resonator. We observe a tunability \u2206fmax of 700 MHz for sample A and 480 MHz for\nsample B (see Fig. 2(b)). The Q value is obtained from the line width \u03b4f and depends on the detuning. Therefore,\nthe number of detuned line widths \u2206f /\u03b4f as a function of detuning gives a figure of merit for the devices. This is\nploted in the inset of Fig. 3(b). The maximum \u2206f /\u03b4f is similar for the two devices and is around 250. We observe\nthat the Q decreases as the magnetic field is applied (see Fig. 2(b)). We do not yet understand this quantitatively.\nOne possible reason could be inhomogenous broadening due to flux noise, but the source of this noise is not known.\nIn particular, the typical values of 1/f flux noise or 1/f critical current noise are orders of magnitude smaller than\nneeded to explain this effect.\nOne of the most important aspects of the device for qubit coupling is the tuning speed. A measurement of the\ntuning speed that relies on a change of the reflection coefficient will be limited by the ring up time of the resonator\nQ/\u03c90 . In our case, this will be of the order of microseconds. This is however not the same as the speed at which\nthe resonator can be tuned. If we apply fast flux pulses as we drive the resonator on resonance and mix the signal\nfrom the resonator with the drive we observe a beating between the drive frequency and the frequency of the photons\nleaking out of the resonator. This demonstrates that we in fact can tune the cavity much faster then the ring up time\n(see Fig. 3(a)).\nBy varying the amplitude of the flux pulse, we can map out the resonance frequency as a function of flux bias, Fig.\n3(b). We can apply positive and negative flux pulses and in that way we can either increase or decrease the resonance\nfrequency during the pulse. The leakage of energy at the detuned frequency suggests that we can both stretch and\ncompress the photons stored in the resonator in-situ as we apply the flux pulse. The energy stored in the cavity on\nresonance can be obtained as twice the average electrical energy, and ignoring zero point fluctuations\n\n\f4\nb\n\n12\n-0.4\n\n4.4\n\n-0.8\n\n- \u03c9 t/2Q\n\u221de 0\n\n250\n\n4.3\n\n-1.2\n\n10.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n10\n\nA\nB\n\n300\n\n-1\n\nf [GHz]\n\n11\n\nA[mV]\n\nDC\n-Pulse\n+Pulse\n\n4.5\n\n-0.6\n\n11.5\n\n\u2206f/\u03b4f\n\na\n\n4.2\n\n200\n150\n100\n\n4.1\n\n50\n\n9.5\n\n4\n\n1/|fr-f d|\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1.6\n\n1.8\nt [ms]\n\n2\n\n2.2\n\n2.4\n\n3.9\n\n2.6\n\n-0.2\n\n-0.1\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n0.3\n\u2206f [GHz]\n\n0\nF/F0\n\n0.4\n\n0.1\n\n0.5\n\n0.2\n\nFIG. 3: Fast detuning measurements. a, To measure the tuning speed, we first drive the resonator on resonance until\nequilibrium is reached. A fast flux pulse is then applied to detune the resonator from the drive. We then measure the signal\nfrom the resonator as the stored energy decays. Mixing the signal with the drive frequency and filtering out the high frequency\ncomponents (see Fig. 1(b) b)) we observe a decaying, oscillating signal where the frequency of the oscillations is the difference\nfrequency of the drive and the detuned resonant frequency of the resonator. From the decay \u03c4 of the oscillations the Q value\ncan be obtained as Q = \u03c9\u03c4 /2, where the factor of 2 is due to the fact that amplitude and not power is measured. The traces\nare obtained by repeatedly applying a pulse and then average the signal over several pulses. A typical number of average\nused is between one hundred thousand and one million. The decay measurements showed a Q of almost a factor of two less\nthan the value obtained from line width measurements. The discrepancy can be explained by the distribution in amplitude\nof the applied flux pulse. As the data is average over a large number of pulses a small distribution in pulse height cause an\neffective increase in the decay. Inset: the pulse used to detune the resonance frequency. The amplitude of the pulse sets how\nfar the resonator is detuned. b, Resonance frequency obtained from DC measurements compared to values obtained from fast\npulse measurements. We can both increase and decrease the frequency with the fast pulse (indicated by up and down pointing\ntriangles respectively) meaning that we can both stretch and compress the photons in the cavity. The inset shows how many\nlinewidths that the devices A and B are detuned as a function of detuning.\n\nE = ~\u03c90 Np = 2\n\nZ\n\n0\n\nl\n\ncl V (x)V \u2217 (x)\ndx\n2\n\n(4)\n\nwhere V (x) is voltage along the transmission line and cl is the capacitance per unit length. For the fast tuning\nexperiment we apply a power of -141 dBm (assuming 5 dB loss in the cables) giving an average drive photon number\nNp in the resonator of about 5 photons. The average number of thermal photons is much smaller than one since the\ntemperature of the cavity is approximately 20 mK, whereas the cavity frequency corresponds to \u223c 225 mK. The low\nphoton number suggest that we in fact change the frequency of individual photons as we tune the resonator with a\nfast flux pulse. As the cavity is detuned, the photons inside the cavity are forced to adjust to the new resonance\nfrequency. When compressing the photons our external magnetic field is thus doing work on the photons increasing\ntheir energy.\nWe can obtain an estimate on how fast we can tune the device by decreasing the duration time of the flux pulse. If\nwe apply a large detuning pulse, the observed oscillations are fast, allowing us to apply a short pulse and still observe\nthe oscillations. In this way, we can still observe oscillations even decreasing the duration of the pulse down to a few\nns. In Fig. 4 a detuning of 330 MHz for a 10 ns pulse is shown. The rise time of the flux pulse is here only about 3 ns.\nDue to imperfections in the fast pulse line, we get reflections (see lower inset in Fig. 4) causing a slower oscillation to\noccur after the fast oscillations. The pulse can be decreased even further until only one oscillation is observed (not\nshowed here), but the duration of the flux pulse is then of the same order as the rise time.\nIn conclusion, we have designed and measured a tunable superconducting CPW resonator. We have demonstrated\na tunability of 700 MHz for a 4.9 GHz device. As a figure of merit, we see that we can detune the devices more than\n250 corrected linewidths. We have also demonstrated that our device can be tuned substantially faster than its decay\ntime, allowing us to change the frequency of the energy stored in the cavity. Having done this in the few photon limit,\nwe therefore assert that we can tune the frequency of individual microwave photons stored in the cavity. This can be\ndone by several hundred MHz on the timescale of nanoseconds.\nWe believe that the high Q value, large tunability, and the fast tuning make this device very suitable for dynamic\ncoupling of qubits. It should also be an interesting system for the study of fundamental physics, such as generation\nof nonclassical photon states [17].\nAcknowledgements\n\n\f5\n13\n3 ns\n\n9.5\n\n12\n\n9\n8.5\n8\n\n11\n\nA[mV]\n\n7.5\n7\n1.05\n\n10\n\n1.055\n\n1.06\n\n1.065\n\n1.07\n\n0\n-1\n-2\n-3\n-4\n-5\n-6\n-7\n-8\n\n1.05\n\n1.1\n\n9\n8\n7\n\n1\n\n1.05\n\nt [ms]\n\n1.1\n\n1.15\n\nFIG. 4: Tuning the cavity in \u2264 10 ns. Signal when a 10 ns pulse is applied. The rigth inset shows the applied pulse. The\ndetuning is 330 MHz, seen from the period of the oscillations (left inset). Imperfections in the bias line causes small multiple\nreflections of the pulse as seen in the rigth inset, causing the features seen after the fast oscillations in the main figure.\n\nWe acknowledge financial support from the Swedish VR and SSF, from the Wallenberg foundation and from the European Union under the EuroSQIP project.
