Topological insulators are one example where the spin-orbit interaction\nleads the bulk bands to have a non-trivial topology, observable as gapless surface\nor edge states. Another example is the Rashba effect, which lifts the electronspin degeneracy as a consequence of spin-orbit interaction under broken inversion symmetry. It is of particular importance to know how these two effects, i.e.\nthe non-trivial topology of electronic states and Rashba spin splitting, interplay\nwith each other. Here we show, through sophisticated first-principles calculations, that BiTeI, a giant bulk Rashba semiconductor, turns into a topological\ninsulator under a reasonable pressure. This material is shown to exhibit several\nunique features such as, a highly pressure-tunable giant Rashba spin splitting,\nan unusual pressure-induced quantum phase transition, and more importantly\nthe formation of strikingly different Dirac surface states at opposite sides of the\nmaterial.\nIntroduction\nTheoretical work of Kane and Mele [1] has marked a milestone in our understanding of the\ninsulating phase of the matter. In their seminal work, they classified the bulk insulators\naccording to the topological order of their electronic states using quantum metrics known\nas topological indices. When nontrivially ordered, it was predicted that such topological\ninsulators (TI's) should exhibit gapless states at their boundaries, e.g. at the surface or\nedges. The succeeding works have confirmed this prediction by theoretically proposing\nand/or experimentally discovering a number of two and three dimensional TI's, including\nHgTe quantum wells [2, 3] and uniaxially strained bulk HgTe [4, 5], a number of layered\nV2 VI3 binary compounds e.g. Bi2 Se3 , Bi2 Te3 , Sb2 Te3 [6, 7], and the ternary compounds\nLaBiTe3 [8], TlBiTe2 , and TlBiSe2 [9, 10]. The recent first-principles studies have further\nproposed that several half-Heusler compounds such as LaPtBi, LuPtSb, and YPdBi [11\u201314]\ncan turn into a TI under a uniaxial strain, similar to what was predicted and observed\nfor HgTe [4, 5]. Common to all these materials is the presence of heavy elements with a\nreasonably large atomic spin-orbit interaction (SOI). Such a similarity arises from the fact\nthat in all TI systems the bulk band gap is the result of band inversion by SOI [4]. In other\nwords, without such a SOI-induced band inversion, no topological phase can be realized in\na system.\n2\n\n\fIn a more general context, SOI tends to lift the degeneracy of energy bands. In systems\nwith inversion (I) symmetry, such a splitting leaves the energy states spin-degenerate, as\nlong as the time-reversal (T ) symmetry is hold. T -symmetry connects the states \u03c8k,\u2191 and\n\u03c8\u2212k,\u2193 , while the I-symmetry enforces the degeneracy between \u03c8k,\u2191(\u2193) and \u03c8\u2212k,\u2191(\u2193) . Breaking I\nsymmetry lifts the latter constraint and, hence, lets the energy bands be spin-split at generic\nk-points. Rashba spin splitting (RSS) [15] well exemplifies this situation, as described by\nHR =\n\np2\n2m\n\n+ \u03bd[e * (s \u00d7 p)] where e is the direction of the potential gradient, breaking I-\n\nsymmetry, and s and p are the spin and momentum operators, respectively. This interaction\nleads to several unique phenomena, such as the spin Hall effect [16], the spin Galvanic\neffect [17], and the magneto-electric effect [18]. Furthermore, once superconductivity occurs\nin a Rashba system, unusual features such as the mixing of the singlet and triplet pair states,\na large upper critical field beyond the Pauli limit [19, 20], and topological superconductivity\nwith Majorana edge channels [21] can appear. As SOI is responsible for both RSS and\nnon-trivial topology of electronic states in semiconductors, it is therefore of fundamental\ninterest to know how they interplay with each other once they coexist in a system and more\nimportantly what the impact of such an interplay is on the electronic structure of bulk and\nboundary states.\nThe purpose of this work is to study such an interplay in a layered polar compound, BiTeI.\nBacked by our earlier band structure calculations [22, 23], the angle resolved photoemission\nspectroscopy (ARPES) measurements [22, 24] have revealed that the bulk conduction and\nvalence states in BiTeI are subject to a giant RSS of the order of several hundred meV,\nlying among the highest reported so far. In this work we further show using the firstprinciples calculations that by applying a reasonable hydrostatic pressure, P , the material\nturns into a TI with many interesting features, such as a nearly double enhancement in RSS\naccompanied with an unconventional metallic behavior at quantum phase transition. It is\nalso demonstrated that unlike the I-symmetric TI's, the gapless Dirac states in TI phase\nof BiTeI have completely different shapes at different sides of the material. Consequently,\nhere the surface states on both sides can interestingly have the same spin helicity in a rather\nbroad range of energies inside the bulk band gap, in sharp contrast with the centrosymmetric\nTI's.\nResults\nBasic properties. BiTeI belongs to the trigonal space group of P 3m1. As shown in Figs.\n3\n\n\f1-(a) and 1-(b), the crystal structure of BiTeI has a non-centrosymmetric layered structure\nalong its crystallographic c-axis with three atoms in one unit cell. Within each unit, a Bi\natom is sandwiched between one Te and one I, forming a triple layer. Due to the strong\ncovalency and ionicity of Bi-Te and Bi-I bonds, respectively, the bulk crystal intrinsically\npossesses a polar axis along the z-direction. Despite the strong chemical bonding within each\ntriple layer, the adjacent triple layers are weakly coupled via van-der Waals interaction. From\nour previous calculations [23], we know that around the Fermi level EF , all the bands are\nessentially p-type, with conduction bands dominated by Bi-6p and valence bands composed\nof Te-5p and I-5p states. Moreover, due to the negative crystal field splitting (CFS) of the\nvalence bands and positive CFS of conduction bands near EF , in the absence of SOI the\ntop valence bands (TVB's) and bottom conduction bands (BCB's) both become pz type\nB\n(to avoid any confusion, hereafter they are referred to as pA\nz and pz , respectively). These\n\nfeatures make the electronic structure of BiTeI very much similar to that of the well known\nTI systems Bi2 Te3 and Bi2 Se3 [6]. However, here due to the absence of I-symmetry, it's not\npossible to assign a distinct even or odd parity to each band. It is also worth noting that\nin the case of BiTeI, the minimum energy gap EG is not at the Brillouin zone (BZ) center\n\u0393 but areound the hexagonal face center of BZ, A point, where kx = ky = 0 and kz = \u03c0/c,\nas shown in Fig. 1-(c). As will be shown below, because of the latter difference, BiTeI in\nTI phase shows a rather different topological order from what has been found for Bi2 Te3\nand Bi2 Se3 . Introducing SOI, both spin and orbital mixings are allowed. Consequently,\n1\n1\nB\nB\nA\npA\nz (pz ) transforms to |p , \u00b1 2 i ( |p , \u00b1 2 i), thereby getting energetically repelled upward\n\n(downward). This accordingly closes the band gap from 1.2 eV down to 0.286 eV and\ninduces a giant bulk RSS among these two sets of bands around point A (see discussion in\nRef. [23]). Despite such a huge reduction in EG , BiTeI remains a trivial insulator as EG still\noriginates from atomic orbital hybridization between Bi and its neighboring Te and I atoms.\nThe respective band diagram is shown in Fig. 1-(d).\nTopological phase transition in BiTeI under pressure. Our strategy to turn BiTeI\ninto a TI is to modify its chemical bonds by applying an external hydrostatic pressure.\nAs schematically shown in Figs. 1-(d), 1-(e) and 1-(f), through this modification we can\neffectively control both CFS and SOI such that at a critical pressure Pc , |pA , \u00b1 21 i and |pB , \u00b1 12 i\nbecome degenerate, whereas at higher P 's their energy ordering is reversed thereby forming\nan inverted band gap. Controlling CFS by P is rather easy to understand, because any\n4\n\n\fchange in Bi-Te and Bi-I bonds leads to a change in the energy splitting of pA,B\nand pA,B\nz\nx,y\nstates. For example, our non-relativistic band structure calculations reveal that at Pc , the\nCFS of TVB's is so enhanced that, EG is reduced by 200 meV (see the Supplementary Fig.\nS1). Any band gap narrowing associated with CFS modification can be further enhanced\nthrough a subsequent enhancement of RSS of |pA , \u00b1 12 i and |pB , \u00b1 12 i states. As described\nin detail in Ref. [23], this is due to the fact that these two states are symmetrically of the\nsame character and hence can very effectively couple with each other through a Rashba-type\nHamiltonian if they are energetically close to each other. In other words, the closer they are\nto each other, the larger RSS would be achieved.\nTo elucidate this mechanism, we show in Figs. 2-(a), 2-(b) and 2-(c) the respective\nelectronic band dispersions of TVB's and BCB's along the high symmetry direction H \u2212A\u2212L\nof BiTeI as hydrostatically compressed by V /V0 = 1, V /V0 = 0.89 and V /V0 = 0.86, where\nV0 corresponds to the lattice volume at the ambient pressure Pambient . As shown, at Pambient\n(V /V0 = 1) a comparable giant RSS can be seen for both sets of bands with an EG of 286\nmeV. The corresponding Rashba energy ER , defined as the energy difference between the\nconduction band minimum (CBM) and the conduction band crossing point, is nearly 110\nmeV, in perfect agreement with that observed by ARPES measurements [22]. Compressing\nthe volume down to V /V0 = 0.89, ER monotonically increases until it reaches 200 meV,\nastonishingly about two times larger than that at Pambient , as shown in Fig. 2-(b) (for\na detailed comparison see the Supplementary Fig. S2, also). At this point, the system\nreaches its quantum critical point, represented by a full band gap closing along the A \u2212 H\ndirections. It is worth noting that such a quantum phase transition in BiTeI differs from\nthat in usual centrosymmetic TI's, as there it is mediated through a band gap closing at\na single high symmetry k-point, e.g. \u0393 point [25, 26], whereas in BiTeI as will be shown\nshortly due to the spin splitting the band gap is closed at six k-points, all along A \u2212 H\ndirections. Thus, they are describable by six 2 \u00d7 2 Dirac Hamiltonians. Here, it is important\nto stress that because of T -symmetry these six k-points are two-by-two paired with each\nother, therefore their corresponding states form three pairs of 2 \u00d7 2 Dirac fermions. Since\nthe band touching is mediated through odd number of such pairs, the transition to TI phase\nis in principle allowed. Further increasing P , ER starts decreasing and an inverted band\ngap emerges between TVB's and BCB's. Figures 2-(d), 2-(e) and 2-(f) demonstrates the\norbital characteristics of BCB's and TVB's at V /V0 = 1, V /V0 = 0.89 and V /V0 = 0.86,\n5\n\n\frespectively. A thorough analysis of these bands reveals a clear change in their atomic\norbital characteristics as a function of V /V0 . While at V /V0 = 1 the BCB's and TVB's are\ndominated by Bi-6p and Te-5p, respectively, at V /V0 = 0.89 they appear to share rather the\nsame orbital characters near the band touching point. On the other hand at V /V0 = 0.86,\none can clearly see that Bi-6p orbitals now contribute more significantly to TVB's whereas\nthe BCB's become strongly dominated by Te-5p and I-5p states, a clear indication that a\nband inversion has happened and, hence, the system is now in the TI phase. It is worth\nadding that in other parts of BZ including the plane encompassing \u0393, M and K the band\ngap remains finite for the whole range of P 's.\nTo make sure that BiTeI for P > Pc becomes a TI, we have calculated the so-called Z2\ntopological invariant of the whole system when hydrostatically compressed by V /V0 = 0.86.\nBy definition, for three-dimensional systems, Z2 topological invariant is determined by four\nindices, among which one is called the strong topological index \u03bd0 and the three others\nare weak topological indices \u03bd1 , \u03bd2 and \u03bd3 [4]. The complete list is then described as\nZ2 = \u03bd0 ; (\u03bd1 \u03bd2 \u03bd3 ). For a normal insulator all the four indices are zero whereas a strong\nTI is characterized by \u03bd0 = 1. If \u03bd0 = 0 but any of \u03bd1\u22123 is 1, the corresponding system is\ncalled a weak TI. For the numerical computation of Z2 invariants, several approaches have\nbeen proposed [27\u201330]. Here we follow the approach introduced in Ref 27 (see the Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Fig. S3 for a full description of our computational\nmethod for the calculation of the Z2 topological invariants). Our calculations show that at\nV /V0 = 0.86, BiTeI belongs to Z2 =1;(001). This clearly indicates that it is a strong TI.\nInterestingly, the corresponding \u03bd3 turns out to be 1, which can be attributed to the band\ntouching in the hexagonal face of BZ with kz = \u03c0/c, encompassing A and H points. The\ninterference between the physics of strong and weak topological insulators could be therefore an interesting problem here. For example, \u03bd3 = 1 means that the one-dimensional (1D)\nconduction channel can appear by dislocation with a Burger's vector along the z-axis [31].\nThus, the present system may offer an ideal medium to study the interaction between the\nsurface Dirac fermion as guaranteed by \u03bd0 = 1 and such a 1D channel.\nTo further confirm that BiTeI becomes a TI for P > Pc , we next show in Fig. 3 the\nsurface band structures corresponding to I- and Te-terminated sides of BiTeI. While the\nsurface states are fully gaped at Pambient , a gapless state appears for the both sides at Pc .\nAt higher pressures, as shown for the case of V /V0 = 0.86, gapless surface states appear\n6\n\n\fwithin the bulk band gap. A clear indication that BiTeI has now become a strong TI\nand, thereby further confirming the results of our Z2 invariants calculations. Interestingly,\nthe shape of the Dirac surface states at the Te-ended side of BiTeI completely differs from\nthat at the I-ended one. While for the former the Dirac point is deeply buried inside the\nenergy valley formed by the Rashba-split TVB's (resembling the Dirac surface states in\nBi2 Te3 ), on the other side the Dirac point is energetically well above the bulk CBM. By\nincreasing P , due to the reduction of RSS and the subsequent increase in EG , the latter\nDirac point becomes energetically closer to CBM. We expect this to be a characteristic\nfeature for all non-centrosymmetric TI candidates making them distinguishable from Isymmetric TI systems. As a consequence, in a non-centrosymmetric TI, the electrons are\nfractionalized into nonequivalent halves on top and bottom surfaces. This would lead to\nsome novel features and new spintronics functionalities. As shown in Fig. 3-(g) and 3(h), the surface Dirac fermions show the similar spin polarization patterns at the top and\nbottom surfaces, in sharp contrast to the centrosymmetric TI's. It is to be noted that for\nsome thin slabs of Bi2 Se3 and Bi2 Te3 , such an effect appears to happen when the equivalence\nof the two surfaces is lifted, e.g. by applying an electric field [32] or by differing chemical\nfunctionalization [33]. Because of this effect, the Dirac point traverses across the bulk band\ngap on going from the top side to the bottom side, and always crosses EF on the side surface\nas long as EF is within the bulk gap. Therefore, if one applies a magnetic field or dopes\nmagnetic impurities, an insulating stripe is expected to appear on the side surface (since EF\nis now located inside the energy gap of the side surface Dirac fermion). Also the giant spin\nGalvanic effect is expected since the current-spin relation of the top side is the same as taht\nof the bottom side. When the hybridization between the Dirac fermions at top and bottom\nsurfaces occurs, in the momentum space a gap appears along a one-dimensional (nearly)\ncircular path, resulting in the divergence of the density of states. This accordingly leads\nto the enhanced electron correlation effect and, consequently, to the excitonic instability.\nThese are just a few examples of the novel phenomena expected in the non-centrosymmetric\nTI's.\nEstimation of Pc . Let us now briefly discuss on the possible value of Pc required for\ntopological phase transition. Performing two sets of volume optimization calculations using\nthe local density approximation (LDA) and generalized gradient approximation (GGA) and\n\n7\n\n\fthen fitting the respective free energies E(V ) to the Murnaghan equation of state [34]\n\u0014\n\u0015\n\u2032\nB0 V (V0 /V )B0\nB0 V0\nE(V ) = E0 +\n+1 \u2212 \u2032\n(1)\n\u2032\n\u2032\nB0\nB0 \u2212 1\nB0 \u2212 1\n(see Fig. 4), we estimate the upper and lower limits of Bulk modulus B0 of BiTeI to be\n\u223c 21.9 GPa and \u223c 8.9 GPa. The respective LDA and GGA values of pressure derivative of\nbulk modulus B0\u2032 are similarly found to be 7.7 and 7.8. As mentioned above, our calculations\nindicate that at Pc , V is compressed by 11%. Using the relation [34]\n\"\u0012 \u0013 \u2032\n#\nB\nB0\nV0 0\nP (V ) = \u2032\n\u22121 ,\nB0\nV\n\n(2)\n\nPc is accordingly expected to be in the range of 1.7 GPa to 4.1 GPa. Given that this range\nof P 's is rather easily affordable in laboratory, we thus hope this work would stimulate\nexperimentalists in this field to explore such an intriguing topological insulating phase in\nBiTeI.\nDiscussion\nAt this point it is worth explaining (i) as to why BiTeI becomes gapless only at a certain\nPc but not for a range of P 's as discussed before [35, 36] and (ii) why such a gapless state\noccurs along a specific direction. Group theory is the key to answer these questions. Let\nus first explain the role of crystalline symmetry for the development of dispersion minima\n(maxima) at BCB (TVB) along particular directions. As already mentioned, BiTeI belongs\nto C3v symmetry consisting of a three-fold rotation C3 along the z-direction and three mirror\noperations M: y \u2192 \u2212y where y is along A \u2212 H directions. For spin 1/2 electrons, C3 and\nM can be represented as e\u2212i\u03c3z \u03c0/3 and i\u03c3y , respectively, where \u03c3x,y,z are Pauli matrices for\nspin degrees of freedom. Additionally T operator can be defined as i\u03c3y K, where K is the\ncomplex conjugation. We can then construct a two band Hamiltonian Hc (k) for the BCB's\ninvariant under C3 , M and T . Up to cubic terms of k it turns out to be:\nHc (k) =\n\nkx2 + ky2 (kz \u2212 \u03c0/c)2\n+ \u03bdk,c (kx \u03c3y \u2212 ky \u03c3x ) + \u03bbc (3kx2 \u2212 ky2 )ky \u03c3z ,\n+\n2m\u2217\u22a5,c\n2m\u2217k,c\n\n(3)\n\nwhere m\u2217\u22a5,c and m\u2217k,c are the in-plane and out-of-plane effective masses of BCB's and \u03bdk,c =\n\u03bdc (1 + \u03b1c k 2 ). Note that in a similar manner, one can construct Hv (k) for TVB's. The third\nterm in Hc (k) is obviously the Rashba term allowing a cylindrical in-plane spin splitting\nwithin kx,y plane. The fourth term, hereafter referred to as Hw (k), acts as a warping term,\ntrigonally distorting the energy bands.\n8\n\n\fDue to Hw (k), the inner and outer branches of the Rashba-split conduction bands are\ndistorted in a way that by approaching CBM they first merge together at k-points along\nA \u2212 L directions and then form six energy pockets each of which centered along one of six\nA \u2212 H directions, as shown in Fig. 5-(a). Exactly at CBM these six pockets reduce to six\npoints. In the same manner, Hw (k) distorts TVB's such that the valence band maximum\n(VBM) appears as a point similarly lying along A \u2212 H. This accordingly explains why band\ntouching between TVB's and BCB's occurs along A \u2212 H direction at Pc . It is to be noted\nthat as a direct result of Hw (k), the energy gap along A \u2212 L directions is always larger than\nthat along A \u2212 H directions for the whole range of P 's, as shown in Fig. (2) and also the\nSupplementary Fig. S2-(e). Accordingly, neither at Pc nor at any other P the band touching\ncan happen along A \u2212 L directions. The effect of P is to enhance \u03bb for P \u2264 Pc such that at\nthe band touching points one can clearly see a rather large gap (as large as 40 meV) along\nA \u2212 L directions where Hw contribution is zero. Such a warping effect and its enhancement\nat quantum critical point can be well understood by comparing Figs. 5-(b), 5(c) and 5-(d),\nin which the isocontours of energy for an arbitrary EF fixed at 20 meV above the CBM\n(corresponding to the dashed brown lines in Fig. 2) are shown at different P 's. As can be\nseen, at Pc the inner and outer branches of Rashba-split conduction bands are just about\nto form the six energy pockets, whereas away from Pc they form two distinct rings among\nwhich the outer one appears to be more significantly distorted by Hw .\nLet us now address the first question, that is, why the gapless state in BiTeI can be\nrealized only at a certain Pc but not for a range of P 's. For the description of gap-closing we\ncan focus on the two bands touching at Pc among the four bands near the chemical potential.\nGenerally, the topological phase transition in time-reversal invariant non-centrosymmetric\nP\nsystems can be described by using a two-band Hamiltonian H2\u00d72 (k, P ) = 3i=0 fi (k, P )\u03c4i\n\nwhere \u03c41,2,3 are the Pauli matrices and \u03c40 is the unit matrix. The real functions f0,1,2,3\n\ndepend on the three momenta k = (kx , ky , kz ) and P , and are assumed to take into account\nthe interaction of conduction and valence bands. The topological phase transition through\nan accidental band touching occurs if and only if the three conditions of f1,2,3 (k, P ) = 0 are\nsatisfied simultaneously in the (k, P ) space. According to the recent work by Murakami [35,\n36], the band touching points, in general, form a curve in the (k, P ) space because the three\nconditions f1,2,3 (k, P ) = 0 cannot uniquely specify the four parameters (k, P ). Therefore if\nthe system is free of additional constraints other than the time-reversal symmetry, a gapless\n9\n\n\fmetallic phase is expected to appear in a finite range of P \u2208 (Pc1, Pc2 ) between the two\ncritical pressures Pc1 and Pc2 . The occurrence of the single Pc in BiTeI is traced back to\nthe fact that the band touching occurs along a particular direction in BZ on which the\nHamiltonian has an additional symmetry constraint. Along the A \u2212 H line, e.g., (kx , kz ) =\n(0, \u03c0/c), the system is invariant under the combined operation \u03a9 \u2261 T M of the T and M\nsymmetries. For T = i\u03c3y K and M = i\u03c3y , \u03a9 is given by K, which imposes the following\n\u2217\nreality conditions: \u03a9H2\u00d72 (ky , P )\u03a9\u22121 = H2\u00d72\n(ky , P ) = H2\u00d72 (ky , P ). Because of this reality\n\ncondition, f2 (ky , P ) = 0 at all points along the A\u2212H direction. Therefore the band touching\ncan be achieved when the two conditions f1,3 (ky , P ) = 0 are satisfied in the (ky , P ) space.\nSince the number of conditions to be satisfied is the same as the number of parameters, a\ngapless phase appears only at a single critical point (ky,c , Pc ).\nTo conclude, using the first-principles calculations we have examined the role of spinorbit interaction in the giant bulk Rashba semiconductor BiTeI and found that under the\napplication of pressure, it leads the system to be an unusual topological insulator. The\nnovel surface states and quantum critical phenomena are intriguing problems for further\nstudies. The effects of the long range Coulomb interaction and disorder are, for example,\ntwo important issues remaining to be addressed by both the theory and experiment.\n\n10\n\n\fMethods\nVolume optimizations. To simulate the effect of P , we optimized the structure of BiTeI\ncrystal at various volumes ranging from V /V0 = 1 to V /V0 = 0.84, where V0 denotes the\nvolume of BiTeI unitcell at Pambient (a = 4.339 \u00c5 and c = 6.854 \u00c5). For a given volume,\nboth the atomic positions and crystal's shape were allowed to be fully optimized until the\nmagnitude of force on all ions became less than 0.005 eV/\u00c5. All the structural optimization calculations were performed using both the LDA functional and GGA functional of\nPerdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (GGA-PBE) as implemented in the VASP program [37, 38]. The\ncorresponding Brillouin zone was sampled by a 20 \u00d7 20 \u00d7 20 k-mesh. The respective upper\nand lower limits of bulk modulus B0 was estimated by fitting the LDA and GGA-PBE free\nenergies E(V ) to the Murnaghan equation of state [34], using Eqn. 1. To relate the volume\nchanges to P , we then used Eqn. 2.\nBulk electronic structure calculations. Within the same level of GGA-PBE theory,\nthe electronic structures of the optimized structures were calculated using the augmented\nplane wave plus atomic orbitals (APW-LO) method as implemented in the WIEN2K program [39]. For this calculations, the muffin tin radii were set to RM T = 2.5 bohr for all\nthe atoms and the maximum modulus of the reciprocal vectors Kmax was chosen such that\nRM T Kmax = 7.0.\nSurface electronic structure calculations. To calculate the surface band structure,\nfor each V /V0 the corresponding APW-LO Hamiltonian was first downfolded into an effective low energy 18 \u00d7 18 tight binding model using maximally localized Wannier functions\n(MLWF's) [40\u201342]. We chose px , py and pz states as the projection centers on all I, Te and\nBi atoms to span the top 12 valence bands and the 6 lowest conduction bands by our 18 \u00d7 18\nmodels. Based on these realistic models, we then constructed large tight binding supercell\nHamiltonians composed of 50 units of BiTeI along its hexagonal c-axis. The surface states\nof each side is then computed by diagonalizing the whole Hamiltonian and projecting the\ncorresponding eigenstates onto the MLWF's of the corresponding surface layer.\n\n[1] Kane, C.
