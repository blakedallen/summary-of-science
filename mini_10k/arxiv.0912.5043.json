INTRODUCTION\nOptimization problems of various kinds simplify\nsignificantly if the goal and constraint functions involved are\nconvex. Indeed, a convex optimization problem has a unique\nglobal solution, which can be found either analytically or, with\na reasonable effort, by several efficient numerical methods; its\nnumerical complexity grows only moderately with the problem\ndimensionality and required accuracy; convergence rates and\nrequired step size can be estimated in advance; there are\npowerful analytical tools that can be used to attack a problem\nand that provide insights into such problems even if solutions,\neither analytical or numerical, are not found yet [1][2].\nContrary to this, not only generic nonlinear optimization\nproblems do not possess these features, they are not solvable\nnumerically, i.e. their complexity grows prohibitively fast with\nproblem dimensionality and required accuracy [2]. Thus, there\nis a great advantage in formulating or at least in approximating\nan optimization problem as a convex one.\nIn the world of digital communications, one of the major\nperformance measures is either symbol or bit error rate (SER\nor BER). Consequently, when an optimization of a\ncommunication system is performed, either SER or BER often\nappears as goal or constraint functions. Examples include\noptimum power/rate allocation in spatial multiplexing systems\n(BLAST) [3], optimum power/time sharing for a transmitter\nand a jammer [4], rate allocation or precoding in multicarrier\n(OFDM) systems [5], optimum equalization [6], optimum\nmultiuser detection [7], and joint Tx-Rx beamforming\n(precoding-decoding) in MIMO systems [8]. Symbol and bit\nerror rates of the maximum likelihood (ML) detector have\nbeen extensively studied and a large number of exact or\napproximate analytical results are available for various\nmodulation formats, for both non-fading and fading AWGN\nchannels [9][10]. On the other hand, convexity properties of\nerror rates are not understood so well, especially for\nconstellations of complicated geometry, large dimensionality\nor when coding is used. Results in this area are scarce. Many\nknown closed-form error rate expressions can be verified by\n\nDepartment of Electrical Engineering\nEcole de Technologie Superieure\nMontreal, H3C 1K3, Canada\ne-mail: francois.gagnon@etsmtl.ca\n\ndifferentiation to be convex, but this approach does not\nprovide any generic conclusions. Convexity properties for\nbinary modulations have been studied in-depth in [4],\nincluding applications to transmitter and jammer\noptimizations, and were later extended to arbitrary\nmultidimensional constellations in [11][12] in terms of the\nSER under maximum-likelihood detection. A log-concavity\nproperty of the SER as a function of the SNR [dB] for the\nuniform square-grid constellations has been established by\nConti et al [13].\nUnfortunately, convexity of SER does not say anything in\ngeneral about convexity of the BER, since the latter depends\non pairwise probabilities of error (PEP) and not on the SER\n[14]. Since the BER is an important performance indicator and\nthus appears as an objective in many optimization problems,\nwe study its convexity in the present paper using a generic\ngeometrical framework developed in [11][12]. Our setting is\ngeneric enough so that the results apply to constellations of\narbitrary order, shape and dimensionality, which may also\ninclude coding\nFirst, we establish convexity properties of the PEP as a\nfunction of SNR: it is convex at high SNR regime, concave at\nthe low one, and has an odd number of inflection points inbetween. Based on this, convexity of the BER at high SNR is\nestablished for arbitrary constellation and coding. Thus, this\nproperty is a consequence of Gaussian noise density and\nmaximum likelihood detection rather than particular\nconstellation or coding technique. We also show that the BER\nis a convex function of the noise power in the small noise/high\nSNR mode.\nII. SYSTEM MODEL\nThe standard baseband discrete-time system model with an\nAWGN channel, which includes matched filtering and\nsampling, is\n\nr =s+\u03be\n\n(1)\n\nwhere s and r are n-dimensional vectors representing the Tx\nand Rx symbols respectively, s \u2208 {s1 , s 2 ,..., s M } , a set of M\nconstellation points, \u03be is the additive white Gaussian noise\n(AWGN), \u03be ~ N (0, \u03c3 02 I ) , whose probability density function\n(PDF) is\n\np\u03be (x) = ( 2\u03c0\u03c3 02 )\n\n\u2212n / 2\n\ne\u2212 x\n\n2\n\n2 \u03c3 02\n\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03c3 02 is the noise variance per dimension, and n is the\nconstellation dimensionality; lower case bold letters denote\nvectors, bold capitals denote matrices, xi denotes i-th\n\n\fcomponent of x , x denotes L2 norm of x , x = xT x , where\nthe superscript T denotes transpose, x i denotes i-th vector.\nThe average (over the constellation points) SNR is defined as\n\u03b3 = 1 / \u03c3 02 , which implies the appropriate normalization,\nM\n2\n1\ns = 1.\nM \u2211 i =1 i\nConsider the maximum likelihood detector, which is\nequivalent to the minimum distance one in the AWGN\nchannel, s\u02c6 = arg min si r \u2212 s i . The probability of symbol error\nPei\ngiven\nthat\ns = si\nwas\ntransmitted\nis\nPei = Pr [s\u02c6 \u2260 s i s = si ] = 1 \u2212 Pci , where Pci is the probability of\ncorrect decision. The SER averaged over all constellation\nM\npoints is Pe = \u2211 i =1 Pei Pr [s = si ] = 1 \u2212 Pc . Pei can be expressed\nas\n\nPei = 1 \u2212 \u222b\n\n\u03a9i\n\np\u03be (x)dx\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03a9 i is the decision region (Voronoi region), and s i\ncorresponds to x = 0 , i.e. the origin is shifted for convenience\nto the constellation point s i . \u03a9 i can be expressed as a convex\npolyhedron [1],\n\n\u03a9 i = {x Ax \u2264 b} , aTj =\n\n(s j \u2212 s i )\n1\n, b j = s j \u2212 si\ns j \u2212 si\n2\n\n(4)\n\nwhere aTj denotes j-th row of A , and the inequality in (4) is\napplied component-wise. Clearly, Pei and Pci posses the\nopposite convexity properties.\nAnother important performance indicator is the pairwise\nprobability\nof\nerror\n(PEP)\ni.e.\na\nprobability\nPr {s i \u2192 s j } = Pr \uf8ee\uf8f0s\u02c6 = s j s = s i \uf8f9\uf8fb to decide in favor of s j given\nthat s i , i \u2260 j , was transmitted, which can be expressed as\n\nPr {s i \u2192 s j } = \u222b\n\n\u03a9j\n\np\u03be (x)dx\n\n(5)\n\nwhere \u03a9 j is the decision region for s j when the reference\nframe is centered at s i . The SER can now be expressed as\n\nPei = \u2211 j \u2260 i Pr {s i \u2192 s j }\n\n(6)\n\nand the BER can be expressed as a positive linear combination\nof PEPs [14]\nM\n\nhij\nBER = \u2211 \u2211\nPr {s = s i } Pr {s i \u2192 s j }\nlog\n2M\ni =1 j \u2260 i\n\n(7)\n\nwhere hij is the Hamming distance between binary sequences\nrepresenting s i and s j .\nNote that the model and error rate expressions we are using\nare generic enough to apply to arbitrary constellations, which\nmay also include coding under maximum-likelihood decoding\n(codewords are considered as points of an extended\nconstellation). We now proceed to establish convexity\nproperties of error rates in this generic setting.\n\nIII. CONVEXITY OF SYMBOL ERROR RATES\nConvexity properties of symbol error rates for arbitrary\nconstellations in the SNR and noise power have been\n\nestablished in [11][12] and are summarized below for\ncompleteness and comparison purpose.\nTheorem 1 (Theorem 1 and 2 in [11]): The SER Pe is a\nconvex function of the SNR \u03b3 for any constellation (which\nmay also include coding) if n \u2264 2 ,\n\nd 2 Pe d \u03b3 2 = Pe\u2032\u2032\u03b3 > 0\n\n(8)\n\nFor n > 2 , the following convexity properties hold:\n\u2022 Pei is convex in the large SNR mode,\n2\n\u03b3 \u2265 ( n + 2n ) d min,\ni\n\n(9)\n\nwhere d min, i is the minimum distance from s i to its\ndecision region boundary,\n\u2022 Pei is concave in the small SNR mode,\n2\n\u03b3 \u2264 ( n \u2212 2n ) d max,\ni\n\n(10)\n\nwhere d max,i is the maximum distance from s i to its\ndecision region boundary,\n\u2022 there are an odd number of inflection points,\nPci \u03b3\u2032\u2032 = Pei \u03b3 \u2032\u2032 = 0 , in the intermediate SNR mode,\n\n(n \u2212\n\n2\n2\n2n ) d max,\ni \u2264 \u03b3 \u2264 ( n + 2n ) d min, i\n\n(11)\n\n\u2022 the SER Pe is convex at high SNR,\n\n2\n\u03b3 \u2265 ( n + 2n ) d min\n\n(12)\n\nwhere d min = min i {d min,i } is the minimum distance to\ndecision region boundary in the constellation.\nTheorem 2 (Theorem 4 in [11]): Symbol error rates have\nthe following convexity properties in the noise power\nPN = \u03c3 02 , for any n and constellation geometry,\n\u2022 Pei is concave in the large noise mode,\n2\nPN \u2265 d max,\ni ( n + 2 \u2212 2( n + 2) )\n\n\u22121\n\n(13)\n\n\u2022 Pei is convex in the small noise mode,\n2\nPN \u2264 d min,\ni ( n + 2 + 2( n + 2) )\n\n\u22121\n\n(14)\n\n\u2022 there are an odd number of inflection points for\nintermediate noise power,\n\u22121\n\u22121\n2\n2\n(15)\nd min,\n\u2264 PN \u2264 d max,\ni ( n + 2 \u2212 2( n + 2) )\ni ( n + 2 + 2( n + 2) )\n\u2022 the SER Pe is convex in the small noise/high SNR mode,\n2\nPN \u2264 d min\n( n + 2 + 2(n + 2) )\n\n\u22121\n\n(16)\n\nWhile the convexity properties above are important for many\noptimization problems, they do not lend any conclusions about\nconvexity of the BER, since the latter is not directly related to\nPe or Pei in general. While, in some cases, the BER can be\nexpressed as linear combination of Pei , there are positive and\nnegative terms so that no conclusion about convexity can be\nmade in this case either. On the other hand, the BER can be\nexpressed as a positive linear combination of pairwise\nprobabilities of error so that the convexity of the latter implies\nthe convexity of the former. Thus, we study below the\n\n\fconvexity property of the PEP, from which the convexity\nproperty of the BER will follow.\n\nIV. CONVEXITY OF PAIRWISE PROBABILITY OF ERROR\nIn many cases, it is a pairwise error probability that is a key\npoint in the analysis (e.g. for constructing a union bound and\nother performance metrics). Furthermore, it is also a basic\nbuilding block for the BER in (7), so that we establish its\nconvexity property first.\nTheorem 3:\na) The pairwise error probability Pr {s i \u2192 s j } is a convex\nfunction of the SNR at the high SNR region,\n2\n\u03b3 \u2265 (n + 2n ) / d min,\ni , for any n;\nb) for n = 1, 2 , it is concave at the low SNR region,\n\u03b3 \u2264 (n + 2n ) / (d ij + d max, j ) 2 , where d ij = s i \u2212 s j is the\ndistance between s i and s j , and there is an odd number of\ninflection points, Pr {s i \u2192 s j }\u2032\u2032 = 0 , in the intermediate SNR\nmode,\n2\n(n + 2n ) / (d ij + d max, j ) 2 \u2264 \u03b3 \u2264 (n + 2n ) / d min,\ni\n\n(17)\n\nc) for n > 2 , the PEP is convex at the low SNR region,\n\u03b3 \u2264 (n \u2212 2n ) / (d ij + d max, j ) 2 , and there is an even number of\ninflection points in-between,\n2\n(n \u2212 2n ) / (d ij + d max, j ) 2 \u2264 \u03b3 \u2264 (n + 2n ) / d min,\ni\nProof: See Appendix.\nWe note that Theorem 3(a) is stronger than Theorem 1 at the\nhigh SNR region since the latter follows from the former but\nthe opposite is not always true (as the other SNR ranges in\nTheorem 3 above indicate). Unlike the SER, the pairwise error\nprobability can be concave at low SNR even for n = 1, 2 .\nSince Theorem 3 holds for any constellation and bit\nmapping, it follows that the convexity property of the PEP at\nhigh SNR is a consequence of Gaussian noise density rather\nthan particular modulation/coding used, where the latter\ndetermines only the SNR threshold.\n\nWe remark that the condition in (18) guarantees the\nconvexity of all PEP, BER and SER. In some cases (Gray\nencoding and when nearest neighbor errors dominate), the\nBER is approximated as SER/ log 2 M , so that it inherits the\nsame convexity properties as in Theorems 1 and 2 above.\nVI. CONVEXITY OF THE PEP AND BER IN NOISE POWER\nIn a jammer optimization problem, it is convexity properties in\nnoise power that are important [4]. Motivated by this fact, we\nstudy below convexity of the PEP and BER in the noise power.\nTheorem 5: The PEP Pr {s i \u2192 s j } is a convex function of\nthe noise power PN = \u03c3 02 , for any n, in the small noise/high\nSNR mode,\n2\nPN \u2264 d min,\ni ( n + 2 + 2( n + 2) )\n\nTheorem 4: The BER is a convex function of the SNR, for\nany constellation and bit mapping, which may also include\ncoding under maximum-likelihood decoding, at the high SNR\nregime,\n2 ,\n\u03b3 \u2265 (n + 2n ) / d min\n\n(18)\n\n(19)\n\nand in the large noise/low SNR mode,\n\nPN \u2265 (d ij + d max, j ) 2 ( n + 2 \u2212 2(n + 2) )\n\n\u22121\n\n(20)\n\nProof: See Appendix.\nBased on this Theorem, the following convexity property of\nthe BER is established.\nCorollary 5.1: For any constellation geometry and\ndimensionality, which may also include coding under ML\ndecoding, the BER is a convex function of the noise power in\nthe small noise/high SNR mode:\n2\nPN \u2264 d min\n( n + 2 + 2(n + 2) )\n\n\u22121\n\n(21)\n\nwhere specifics of the constellation/code determine only the\nupper bound in (21).\nVII.

Since f * ( t ) has the same structure as f ( t )\nin (24), the proof follows the same steps. In particular, if\n2\nd min,\nd 2 p\u03be / dPN2 > 0\u2200x \u2208 \u03a9 j so that the\ni \u2265 \u03b21 PN , then\nintegral in (25) is clearly positive. The other case is proved in a\nsimilar way.

Consider three different cases.\n2\n(i) If d min,\ni \u2265 \u03b11 / \u03b3 , where d min, i = min j (b j ) is the\nminimum distance from the origin to the boundary of \u03a9 i , then\n2\nf ( x ) \u2265 0 \u2200x \u2208 \u03a9 j so that the integral in (23) is clearly\npositive since the integrand is non-negative everywhere in the\nintegration region and positive in some parts of it. Fig. 1\nillustrates this case. This is a high SNR mode since\n2\n\u03b3 \u2265 \u03b11 / d min,\ni.\n\nFig. 1. Two-dimensional illustration of the problem geometry for\n2\nCase 1.

Fig. 2 illustrates this case. This\nis a low-SNR mode since \u03b3 \u2264 \u03b11 / (d ij + d max, j ) 2 . An odd\nnumber of inflection points in Theorem 3(b) follows from the\ncontinuity argument ( Pij\u2032\u2032 is a continuous function of the SNR).\n\n+\n\u2212\n\u03b11\n\u03b3\n\n\u2212\n\n\u03a9i\n\n\u2212\n2\n\nf ( x ) >0\n\n+\n\nx1\n\ndij\n\n\u2212\n\n(iii) Part (c) follows from the same argument as in (ii).\nQ.E.D.\nProof of Theorem 5: follows the same geometric technique\nas for Theorem 3. 2nd derivative of the PEP in the noise power\ncan be expressed as\nd 2 Pij\nd 2 p\u03be ( x)\n=\u222b\ndx\n(25)\n2\n\u03a9j\ndPN\nPN2\n\nx1\n\nd max, j\n2\n\nf ( x ) <0\n\n\u03a9j\n\n+\n\n+\n\nFig. 2.
