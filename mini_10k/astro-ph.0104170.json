The existence of pulsars with spin period below one millisecond is expected, though they have not been detected up to now. Their\nformation depends on the quantity of matter accreted from the companion which, in turn, is limited by the mechanism of mass ejection from the\nbinary. Mass ejection must be efficient, at least in some cases, in order to\nproduce the observed population of moderately fast spinning millisecond\npulsars. First we demonstrate, in the framework of the widely accepted\nrecycling scenario, using a population synthesis approach, that a significant number of pulsars with spin period below one millisecond is expected.\nThen we propose that significant variations in the mass\u2013transfer rate may\n> 1 h, the switch\u2013on of a radio\ncause, in systems with orbital periods \u223c\npulsar whose radiation pressure is capable of ejecting out of the system\nmost of the matter transferred by the companion and prevent any further accretion.

Despite its apparent smallness, Pmin is\nnot a critical period for NS rotation: as shown by Cook, Shapiro & Teukolsky\n(1994), the period Pmin is longer than the limiting period, Plim below which the\nstar becomes unstable to mass shedding at its equator. Indeed Plim \u223c 0.5 ms for\nmost equations of state of the ultra dense the nuclear matter, EoS). However,\nthe re\u2013acceleration of a NS up to ultra short periods depends remarkably on\nthe amount of mass (and hence of angular momentum) accreted from a binary\ncompanion. Back of the envelope calculation shows that M1ms \u223c 0.2 M\u2299 must\nbe accreted to attain P \u223c 1 ms. Conservation of angular momentum requires\nM1ms l = I 2\u03c0/(1ms) where I is the NS moment of inertia, l = (GM Racc )1/2 is\nthe specific angular momentum of the accreting matter, and Racc is the accretion\nradius. Adopting I = 1045 g cm2 and Racc \u223c RNS = 106 cm, where RNS is the\nNS radius, one gets the above result. More accurate calculation that includes\ngeneral relativistic effects and realistic EoS, have almost doubled this estimate,\nshowing that, typically M1ms \u223c 0.35 M\u2299 must be accreted to spin up a NS to 1\nms (Burderi et al. 1999).\nMost donor stars in systems hosting recycled pulsars have certainly lost,\nduring their interacting binary evolution, a mass larger than M1ms . They now\nappear as white dwarfs of mass \u223c 0.15 \u2212 0.30 M\u2299 (Taam, King & Ritter 2000),\nwhose progenitors are likely to have been stars of \u223c 1.0 \u2212 2.0 M\u2299 (Webbink,\nRappaport & Savonije 1983; Burderi, King & Wynn 1996, Tauris & Savonije\n1999). Hence, a crucial parameter for attaining ultra fast rotation is the fraction\nof the mass lost by the companion (Mlost = 0.7 \u2212 1.85 M\u2299 ) which effectively\naccretes onto the NS which, in turns, depends on the mechanisms driving the\nmass ejection from the system.\nIn this paper we discuss the results of population synthesis calculations for\nthe formation of millisecond pulsars (MSPs) in the framework of the standard\nrecycling scenario (\u00a72). We show that, independent of the adopted EoS, the\nexistence of a population of MSPs spinning below 1 ms (submillisecond pulsar,\nSMSP) is predicted, even though these systems have not been detected up to\ndate.\nIn \u00a73 we critically discuss the widely accepted recycling scenario for the\nformation of a MSP outlining the main difficulties of this model by a comparison\nof the present observations with the results obtained in \u00a72.\nTo overcome these difficulties we propose, in \u00a74, that, in some cases, most\nof the transferred mass is ejected by the radiation pressure generated by the\nrapidly spinning NS in a radio pulsar regime. Moreover we investigate how the\nduration of this process, and hence the amount of mass ejected, depends on the\norbital period of the binary system. The mechanism proposed (some aspects of\nwhich were originally suggested by Ruderman, Shaham, & Tavani 1989) naturally provides an explanation for the observed values of masses and spin periods\n\n\fWhere Have All the Submillisecond Pulsars Gone?\n\n3\n\nof MSPs (Thorsett & Chakrabarty 1999; Tauris & Savonije 1999). Our analysis\n< 1 h) could harbour SMSPs. In \u00a75 we\nindicates that only close systems (Porb \u223c\ndiscuss how this results in an observational bias that has prevented the detection\nof SMSPs up to now.\n2.\n\nOn the existence of submillisecond pulsars: a population synthesis\napproach\n\nAlthough Plim depends only on the EoS adopted for the NSs, the effective possibility to accelerate a NS to periods below 1 ms is determined by the modalities\nof the mass transfer from the binary companion and the evolution (decay) of\nthe NS magnetic moment \u03bc (Burderi et al. 1999). In \u00a73 we discuss in some\ndetail the possible scenarios for the mass transfer in these systems. No unique\ntheory exists for the origin and evolution of the NS magnetic moment. The most\ncredited theories suggest either that the field is a remnant from the progenitor\nstar or that it has been generated soon after the formation of the NS. In the\nfirst case, in which the electric currents generating the magnetic field are buried\nin the NS core, the evolution of \u03bc is driven by secular variations in the rotational period of the NS during its evolution (e.g. Srinivasan et al. 1990; Miri\n& Bhattacharya 1994; Ruderman 1998). In the other case, the electric currents\nare generated and confined in the thin crust of the NS and the magnetic field\ndecay is driven by the ohmic diffusion (Sang & Chanmugam 1987). In this latter\ncase magnetic evolution is not univocal: as crustal matter is assimilated into the\ncore during accretion, the magnetic field at the crust\u2013core boundary can either\nbe expelled (boundary condition I, BC I: Urpin, Geppert & Konenkov 1998) or\nadvected into the superconductive core where it no longer decays (BC II: Konar\n& Bhattacharya 1999). Thus, at the endpoint of evolution, the NS can either\nbecome almost non magnetic, or preserve a significant relic field. In this class of\nmodels, the magnetic field decay is connected with the mass accretion history\nwhich determines both the amount of accreted mass (which drives the advection\nprocess) and the thermal evolution of the crust (which modulates the ohmic\ndissipation process by influencing the electron and ion resistivity in the crust).\nTo explore all the possibilities mentioned above within the recycling scenario\nfor the formation of MSPs (Alpar et al. 1982; Bhattacharya 1995) Possenti et\nal. (1998, 1999) carried on a statistical analysis of the NS spin period distributions in the millisecond and submillisecond range, using a population synthesis\nmodel 1 .\nThere is observational evidence (see Tanaka and Shibazaki 1996 for a review) that NSs in low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) may undergo phases of\ntransient accretion (perhaps due to thermal viscous instabilities in an irradiated\n1\n\nThe population synthesis code calculate the mass transfer during the Roche lobe overflow\nconsidering a range of mass\u2013transfer rates which is close to the one observed in low mass X-ray\nbinaries. Eventually the population synthesis code follows the radio pulsar phase. The model\nincorporates the detailed physics of the evolution of a crustal magnetic field (using the two\nboundary conditions described in the text to mimic expulsion or assimilation of the field by\nthe NS core) and includes the relativistic corrections necessary to describe the spin\u2013up process\n(Burderi et al. 1999). A Monte Carlo code (with 3,000 particles) is used to compute the sample\npopulation.\n\n\f4\n\nBurderi\n\ndisc e.g. van Paradijs 1996; King, Kolb, Burderi 1996). This in turn can start\none or more phases of propeller which have been invoked to effectively spin down\nthe NS and eject most of the mass from the system, thus mitigating the effects\nof the previous phases of spin\u2013up. We will critically discuss the propeller mechanism in \u00a73 jeopardizing the whole propeller scenario. In view of our discussion\nin \u00a73, we investigate here the effects of a propeller phase on the population\nof LMXBs by comparing two possibilities: a persistent accretion for the whole\nduration of Roche Lobe Overflow (RLO) phase, or a persistent accretion for\nhalf the previous time followed by a quick stop of the accretion modeled as a\nmass\u2013transfer rate that varies with time \u1e40 \u221d t\u0393 with a power law index \u0393 = 8\nrepresenting a sudden drop of the \u1e40.

Adopting as\nreferences the values of Pmin and \u03bcmin (the shortest rotational period observed in\nPSR 1937+21 and the weakest magnetic moment observed in PSRJ2317+1439),\nthe NS are divided into four groups:\na) P \u2265 Pmin and \u03bc \u2265 \u03bcmin these resemble the MSPs that have been observed\nso far;\nb) P < Pmin and \u03bc \u2265 \u03bcmin these objects represent a population of ultra fast\nradio pulsars (see Burderi & D'Amico 1997);\nc) P < Pmin and \u03bc < \u03bcmin ultra fast radio pulsars with a weak magnetic\nfield.

For simplicity, hereafter we refer to all the\nobjects having P < Pmin and \u03bc above the \"death\u2013line\" as SMSPs;\nd) P \u2265 Pmin and \u03bc < \u03bcmin these are probably radio quiet NSs because they\nare close or below the theoretical \"death\u2013line\" (actually this period range\nwas already searched with negative results by present, good sensitivity\nradio surveys).\n\n\fWhere Have All the Submillisecond Pulsars Gone?\n\n5\n\nFigure 1.\nLeft: percentage distributions of the synthesized MSPs.\nThe four panels indicate, from upper right and counterclockwise: a)\nobjects having P > Pmin and \u03bc > \u03bcmin ; b) P < Pmin and \u03bc > \u03bcmin ;\nc) P < Pmin and \u03bc < \u03bcmin ; d) P > Pmin and \u03bc < \u03bcmin ; (the typical\nvariance is about 1%). Right: spin period distributions of the simulated NS (\u03bc varies over the whole range). The solid lines indicates\nthe distributions in absence of propeller, the dashed areas represent\nthe distributions with a strong propeller effect. The total number of\nobjects is in arbitrary units (a.u.).\n\nThe four panels represent two EoSs (a very stiff one corresponding to a minimum\nspin period Plim \u2243 1.4 ms and a mildly soft one, with Plim \u2243 0.7 ms) and the\ntwo different boundary conditions discussed above for the magnetic field at the\ncrust\u2013core interface (BC I & BC II).\nIt appears that objects with periods P < Pmin are present in a statistically\nsignificant number. In effect, a tail of SMSPs is always present for any reasonable choice of the parameters in table 1. The right panels of figure 1 show\nthe distributions of the number of objects vs the spin period for the NS of our\nsynthetic sample.\nWe first discuss the results in absence of a propeller phase (solid lines).\nFor the mildly soft EoS, the \"barrier\" at Plim \u2243 0.7 ms is clearly visible as\nthe mildly soft EoS produces distributions that increase rather steeply towards\nperiods smaller than 2 ms, irrespective of the boundary condition adopted for\n\u03bc. On the other hand, the boundary conditions on \u03bc affect the fraction of\nobjects with short periods since the magnetospheric radius (that determines\nthe equilibrium spin period) depends on the magnetic moment (see \u00a73). BC II\nproduces a smaller number of objects with a low field as the field initially decays\nbut, when the currents are advected towards the crust\u2013core boundary, the decay\nis halted and the field reaches a bottom value. Even the very stiff EoS permits\nperiods P < Pmin , but the \"barrier\" of mass shedding (at Plim \u2243 1.4 ms) is so\nclose to Pmin = 1.558 ms that only few NSs reach these extreme rotational rates.\nThe effects of a strong propeller phase (lasting \u223c 50% of the RLO phase\nwith an efficiency in ejecting matter from the system close to 100% \u2013 although\n\n\f6\n\nBurderi\n\nthis assumption will be strongly questioned in \u00a73) are shown by the dashed areas.\nWe note that significant mass losses from the system can threaten the formation\nof NSs with P < Pmin only in the (unlikely) case of the very stiff EoS.\nPossenti et al. (1998, 1999) computed the distributions of the number of\nobjects vs the final masses for the different spin periods attained at the end of\nthe evolution. The distributions steepens towards high mass values (approaching\nM \u223c 1.7\u00f71.8 M\u2299 ) for final spin periods below \u223c Pmin . All this results are in line\nwith a general conclusion, namely: an accretion of about 0.35 M\u2299 is a general\nnecessary condition to spin a NS to ultra short periods (see Burderi et al. 1999 for\na more technical discussion that takes into account general relativistic effects).\n3.\n\nRecycling at sub\u2013Eddington rates\n\nIn line with a widely used convention let us define primary the NS and secondary\nits companion.\nIt is well known that an upper limit to the accretion rate is given by the\n< 1.6 M and\nEddington limit, but for typical companion initial masses Mini \u223c\n\u2299\n<\ninitial Porb \u223c 50 days, the donor transfers mass at sub\u2013Eddington rates, making,\nin principle, the whole mass lost by the secondary available for the recycling of\nthe NS.\n\nTable 2.\n\nSystem n.\n\nMNS (M\u2299 )\n\nMdonor (M\u2299 )\n\nPorb (h)\n\nInitial\nFinal\n\n1\n\n1.40\n2.58\n\n1.20\n0.02\n\n10.46\n1.42\n\nInitial\nFinal\n\n2\n\n1.40\n2.39\n\n1.20\n0.21\n\n18.64\n92.15\n\nInitial\nFinal\n\n3\n\n1.40\n2.35\n\n1.20\n0.25\n\n30.55\n338.1\n\nInitial\nFinal\n\n4\n\n1.40\n2.67\n\n1.60\n0.33\n\n34.00\n346.0\n\nMass and period evolution in some LMXBs\n\nWe explored this scenario (i.e. conservative mass transfer) computing the\nsystem evolution (with initial parameters as in table 2) with the ATON1.2 code\n(D'Antona, Mazzitelli & Ritter 1989). The mass loss rate by the companion\nvs. the orbital period is shown in figure 2. The mass loss rate was computed,\nfollowing the formulation by Ritter (1988), as an exponential function of the\ndistance between the stellar radius and the secondary Roche lobe in units of the\npressure scale height. This method also allows to compute the first phases of\nmass transfer, during which the rate reaches values which can be much larger\nthan the stationary values due to the thermal response of the star to mass loss.\nBesides the cases of systems with long Porb in which the donor fills the\nRoche lobe while it is evolving towards the red giant branch (case B of mass\ntransfer, systems n.2,3,4), we consider the case of a system with short Porb and a\nsecondary of 1.2 M\u2299 that fills the Roche lobe during the core\u2013hydrogen burning\n\n\fWhere Have All the Submillisecond Pulsars Gone?\n\n7\n\nFigure 2.\n\u1e40 vs Porb for the systems of table 2. The temporary\nstop of \u1e40 in track 1 is due to the switch\u2013off of the magnetic braking\nonce the star becomes fully convective. The sharp drop of \u1e40 in track\n3 is due to a chemical readjustment of the star structure. The arrows\nshow the Porb that separates cases A and B of mass transfer for a 1.2\nM\u2299 secondary.\n\nphase (case A of mass transfer, system n.1). In systems with long Porb , mass\ntransfer is driven by the thermal and nuclear evolution of the secondary; in\nsystems with short Porb systems mass transfer is driven by magnetic braking\nacting until P \u2243 2.5 h, when the star becomes fully convective. The mass\ntransfer then stops and resumes at a shorter period driven by losses of angular\nmomentum by gravitational radiation, like in cataclysmic variables. In this case\nthe minimum period attainable is \u223c 1.03 h. On the other hand in the systems\nwith long Porb the mass transfer terminates with periods in the 90 \u2013 400 h range.\nIn the systems with long Porb the final masses of the donor stars are in the\n0.21\u22120.33 M\u2299 range, in agreement with the masses measured for the companions\nof MSP, as inferred from accurate timing campaigns (see Burderi, King, & Wynn\n1996). However, the predicted final masses of the NSs are in the 2.35 \u2212 2.67\nM\u2299 range, very close to (or even bigger than) the maximum mass allowed for\na NS in most of the proposed EoSs (Cook, Shapiro & Teukolsky 1994). This\nsuggests either that mass transfer cannot be conservative \u2013 and most of the\ndonor mass must be expelled from the system \u2013 or that the final NS must be\nvery massive implying that accretion\u2013induced collapse to a black hole is a likely\noutcome for LMXBs.\n\n\f8\n\nBurderi\n\nThe propeller effect (Illarionov & Sunyaev 1975) has often been invoked as\nthe process capable of expelling most of the mass transferred by the companion\nstar. The accretion disc is truncated at the magnetospheric radius Rm , at which\nthe magnetic field pressure equals the pressure of the matter in the disc (see\ne.g. Hayakawa 1985 for a review). For a Shakura\u2013Sunyaev accretion disc an\nexpression of Rm can be derived (e.g. Burderi et al. 1998)\n8/27\n\n\u221234/135\n\nRm = 4.70 \u00d7 105 \u03b14/15 \u01eb34/135 n0.615 L37\n\u221234/135 \u2212136/135 16/27\nf\n\u03bc26\n\nR6\n\ncm\n\nm\u22121/135\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b1 is the Shakura\u2013Sunyaev viscosity parameter, \u01eb \u223c 1 is the ratio between\nthe observed luminosity and the total gravitational potential energy released\nper second by the accreting matter, n0.615 = n/0.615 \u223c 1 for a gas with solar\nabundances (where n is the mean particle mass in units of the proton mass\nmp ), L37 is the accretion luminosity in units of 1037 erg/s that measures \u1e40 in\nthe hypothesis that all the transferred mass accretes onto the NS radiating a\nspecific energy \u01eb \u00d7 GM/RNS , m is the NS mass M in solar masses, R6 is the\nNS radius in units of 106 cm, f = [1 \u2212 (R6 /Rm )1/2 ]1/4 \u223c 1, \u03bc26 is the magnetic\nmoment of the NS in units of 1026 G cm3 (\u03bc = Bs R3 where R and Bs are the\nNS radius and surface magnetic field along the magnetic axis respectively). At\nradii r < Rm the accreting matter is forced by the magnetic field to corotate\n\u221234/135\nwith the NS and accretes along the field lines. As Rm \u221d L37\n, a decrease in\nthe mass\u2013transfer rate results in an expansion of the magnetosphere. Accretion\nonto a spinning magnetized NS is centrifugally inhibited once Rm lies outside\nthe corotation radius RCO , the radius at which the Keplerian angular frequency\nof the orbiting matter is equal to the NS spin:\n2/3\n\nRCO = 1.50 \u00d7 106 m1/3 P\u22123 cm\n\n(2)\n\nwhere P\u22123 is the spin period in milliseconds. In this case a significant fraction\nof the accreting matter might be centrifugally ejected from the system: this is\nthe so called propeller phase.\nThe virial theorem sets stringent limits on the fraction of matter that can be\nejected in this phase, in fact, it states that, at any radius in the disc, the virialized\nmatter has already liberated (via electromagnetic radiation) half of its available\nenergy, corresponding to the variation of its potential energy. Considering that\nRm \u223c RNS for MSPs, the matter at the magnetosphere has irradiated \u223c 50% of\nthe whole specific energy obtainable from accretion \u03b7acc = GM/RNS . To eject\nthe same matter (that is close to the NS surface) \u223c 1/2 \u03b7acc must be given back\nto it. As the only source of energy is the accretion process itself, the maximum\nejection efficiency is \u2264 50%. For instance, with a fine tuned alternation of\naccretion and propeller phases of the right duration, the kinetic energy stored\nby the NS in the form of rotational energy during an accretion phase, can be\nused in a subsequent propeller phase to eject almost the same amount of matter\npreviously accreted. The major difficulty with this scenario is that, during the\naccretion phase, once the system has reached the spin\u2013equilibrium, no further\nspin up takes place, and thus the storage of accretion energy in a form that\nallows its subsequent re\u2013usage for ejection is impossible. This is the reason why\n\n\fWhere Have All the Submillisecond Pulsars Gone?\n\n9\n\nthe duration of the accretion and propeller phases has to be ad hoc chosen in\norder to reach ejection efficiencies close to 50 %. It follows that, in any case, the\naccreted mass is no less than half of the transferred mass, i.e. \u2265 0.4 \u2212 0.8 M\u2299 .\nThis has two main consequences:\n1) even taking a propeller phase into account, NSs in MSPs will either be\nvery massive or even collapse into black holes;\n2) as the amount of mass accreted is considerably bigger than the minimum\nrequired to spin up the NSs to ultra short periods (Burderi et al. 1999),\none has to invoke an ad hoc final, long lasting propeller phase with an\nhighly effective spin down to form the observed population of moderately\nfast spinning MSPs.\nThe only way to overcome these difficulties is to obtain ejection efficiencies\nclose to unity. This is indeed possible if matter is ejected far from the NS surface\nthrough a large expansion of the magnetospheric radius (Rm \u2192 r >> RNS ), at\na distance where the orbiting matter has an almost negligible binding energy\nGM/r << \u03b7acc . As the NS is spinning very fast, the switch on of a radio pulsar\nis unavoidable once Rm \u2192 r (see \u00a74). In the next section we demonstrate that,\nunder particular circumstances, the pressure exerted by the radiation field of\nthe radio pulsar overcomes the pressure of the accretion disc, thus determining\nthe ejection of the matter from the system. We note that, once the disc has\nbeen swept away, the radiation pressure stops the infall of matter far away from\nthe NS surface, i.e. in a region where \u03b7acc \u223c 0, thus overcoming the 50 %\nefficiency limit imposed by the virial theorem. This means that the pressure\nof the radiation emitted by pulsar is a viable mechanism to sweep most of the\nmatter away from the system. We discuss this possibility in the next section.\n4.\n\nThe effects of the pulsar energy outflow\n\nThe interaction of the accreting matter with the (assumed dipolar) magnetic\nfield of the NS can be described in terms of an outward pressure (we use the\nexpressions outward or inward pressures to indicate the versus of the force with\nrespect to the radial direction) exerted by the rotating magnetic field on the\naccretion flow (see e.g. Hayakawa, 1985).\nThe light\u2013cylinder radius, RLC = cP/2\u03c0 (where an object corotating with\nthe NS reaches the speed of light c), separates an inner region, where the magnetic dipole pressure term is relevant, from an outer region where the radiation\npressure of the rotating dipole is acting.\nFor r < RLC , the outward pressure, due to the magnetic field, is\nPMAG =\n\nB2\n= 7.96 \u00d7 1014 \u03bc226 r6\u22126 dy/cm2\n8\u03c0\n\n(3)\n\nwhere r6 is the distance from the NS center in units of 106 cm. For r > RLC the\noutward pressure is given by the radiation pressure which, assuming isotropic\nemission, is given by:\n\u22124 2 \u22122\nPRAD = 2.04 \u00d7 1012 P\u22123\n\u03bc26 r6 dy/cm2 .\n\n(4)\n\n\f10\n\nBurderi\n\nIn figure 3 the two outward pressures defined above are shown as bold lines for\ntypical values of the parameters (see figure caption).\nThe accretion flow, in turns, exerts a inward pressure on the field that is\nthe sum of the thermal gas pressure Pgas = \u03c1kT /nmp , and the light radiation\npressure Plight = \u03c3T 4 /c, where \u03c1 and T are the flow density and temperature, k\nis the Boltzmann constant, and \u03c3 is the Stefan\u2013Boltzmann constant. In the case\nof a Shakura\u2013Sunyaev accretion disc orbiting a compact object of \u223c 1 M\u2299 we\n< P\nhave Plight \u223c\ngas for \u1e40 < \u1e40E and r > RNS (see e.g. Frank, King & Raine\n1992). Adopting for the inward disc presure PDISC \u2243 Pgas we have\n17/20\n\nPDISC = 1.02 \u00d7 1016 \u03b1\u22129/10 \u01eb\u221217/20 n\u22121\n0.615 L37\n17/20 17/5 \u221221/8\nf\nr6\n\nR6\n\nm1/40\n\ndy/cm2\n\n(5)\n\nwhere f = [1 \u2212 (R6 /r6 )1/2 ]1/4 \u2264 1 and r6 is the generic radial distance in units\nof 106 cm. As before we measure \u1e40 in units of L37 in the hypothesis that all the\ntransferred mass accretes onto the NS radiating a specific energy \u01eb \u00d7 GM/RNS .\nThe disc pressure line tangent to the intersection point of (3) and (4) defines\na critical mass\u2013transfer rate Mswitch (i.e. a critical luminosity Lswitch ) at which\nthe radio pulsar switches\u2013on. This depends on the position of the light\u2013cylinder\nradius, and hence on the spin period of the NS: the faster is the rotation of the\nNS, the smaller is RLC , and the larger is the critical mass\u2013transfer rate at which\nthe pulsar switches\u2013on.\nIn figure 3 the inward disc pressures (equation 5) for two different \u1e40 (measured in units of L37 as discussed above) are shown as solid lines. The disc\npressure corresponding to Lswitch is shown as a dotted line.\nFor a given mass\u2013transfer rate \u1e40high (corresponding to a luminosity L =\n2\u00d71037 erg/s in figure 3), the intersections of the relative PDISC line with each of\nthe inward pressure lines (points S and U in the upper panel of the same figure)\ndefine equilibria points between the inward and outward pressures. However,\nthe equilibrium is stable at S (i.e. at r = Rm , as defined by equation 1), and\nunstable at U (i.e. at r = RSTOP ).2\nIn fact, as PMAG is steeper than PDISC at S, if a small fluctuation forces the\ninner rim of the disc inward (outward), in a region where the magnetic pressure\nis greater (smaller) than the disc pressure, this results in a net force that pushes\nthe disc back to its original location Rm . On the other hand, as PRAD is flatter\nthan PDISC at U, no stable equilibrium is possible at RSTOP . In fact, if a small\nfluctuation forces the inner rim of the disc inward, PDISC dominates over PRAD\nand the disc moves inward until the stable equilibrium point S at Rm is reached.\nBut, conversely, if a small fluctuation forces the inner rim of the disc outward,\nPRAD dominates over PDISC and the disc is swept away by the radiation pressure.\nThis means that, for r > RSTOP no disc can exist for any mass\u2013transfer rate\n\u2264 \u1e40high .\n2\n\nAn explicit expression for RSTOP can be derived equating (4) and (5).\n34/25\n\nRSTOP = 8.26 \u00d7 1011 \u03b1\u221236/25 \u01eb\u221234/25 n0.615 L37\n\u22128/5\n\n34/25\n\nm1/25 R6\n\nf 136/25 \u03bc26\n\n\u221216/5\n\n32/5\n\nP\u22123\n\ncm.\n\n(6)\n\n\fWhere Have All the Submillisecond Pulsars Gone?\n\n11\n\nIt is convenient to define compact systems those in which the primary Roche\n2/3\nlobe radius (RL1 \u221d Porb ) lies inward RSTOP (figure 3, upper panel) and wide\nthose in which the primary Roche lobe radius lies outward RSTOP (figure 3,\nlower panel), as these systems behave very differently in response to significant\nand abrupt variations of the mass\u2013transfer rate.\nLet us consider, indeed, the effects of such a sudden variation in the mass\u2013\ntransfer rate, as is the case e.g. of a transient system alternating between outbursts (\u1e40high ) and quiescence (\u1e40low ) phases. The corresponding luminosities\nare 2 \u00d7 1037 and 3 \u00d7 1033 erg/sec, respectively.\nFor simplicity, in the transition from outburst to quiescence (quiescence to\noutburst), let us assume that the timescale on which the drop (rise) in the disc\npressure occurs is much shorter than the timescale on which the magnetosphere\nexpands (contracts), as this does not affect the general conclusions.\nThe behaviour of a compact system (short orbital period, e.g. Porb = 0.5\nh) is cyclic, as shown in figure 3, upper panel.\nIc Accretor. During the outburst, the magnetospheric radius (delimiting the\ninner radius of the disc) is smaller than both the corotation and the light\u2013\ncylinder radius and the NS will normally accrete matter and angular momentum, thus increasing its spin.\nIIc Radio ejector. The sudden drop in the mass\u2013transfer rate (quiescence)\ninitiates a phase, that we termed \"radio ejection\", in which the mechanism that drives mass overflow from the inner Lagrangian point L 1 is still\nactive, while the pulsar radiation pressure at L 1 prevents mass accretion.\nIn fact, as soon as the new disc pressure (at the same outburst magnetospheric radius, because of our assumption on the drop and rise timescales)\ndrops below Pswitch , the magnetosphere expands beyond the light cylinder\nradius and the radio pulsar switches\u2013on pushing the disc away from the\nsystem until RL1 is reached starting the radio ejection phase (track A).\nAs the overflowing matter cannot accrete, it is now ejected as soon as it\nenters the Roche lobe of the primary, where its binding energy is negligible, thus circumventing the limit imposed by the virial theorem discussed\nin the previous section and allowing ejection efficiencies close to 100%.\nThe ejected matter presumably leaves the system with a specific angular momentum l between those of the inner and outer Lagrangian points\n(2\u03c0/Porb )d2L1 < l < (2\u03c0/Porb )d2L2 , where dL1 and dL2 are the distances between the centre of mass of the system and the inner and outer Lagrangian\npoints respectively.\nIc Accretor. When a new outburst occurs, the mass\u2013transfer rate rises back\nto its original value (L = 2 \u00d7 1037 ergs/s), the disc follows track B, and the\naccretion resumes. In the subsequent quiescence, the system goes back to\na radio ejection phase IIc, alternating between Ic and IIc in response to\nthe variations of the mass\u2013transfer rate.\nThe response of a wide system (long orbital period, e.g. 47 h) with the\nsame transient behaviour is quite different, as shown in figure 3, lower panel.\nIw Accretor. For the same initial mass\u2013transfer rates as in Ic, the NS accretes\nmatter and increases its spin.\n\n\f12\n\nBurderi\n\nIIw Radio ejector. The same drop in mass\u2013transfer as in case IIc triggers the\nswitching\u2013on of the radio pulsar and the subsequent radio ejection of the\nmatter overflowing RL1 (track A).\nIIIw Radio ejector. Contrary to the compact system case, when the mass\u2013\ntransfer rate recovers its previous value, the cyclic behaviour is lost. Indeed, since for wide systems RL1 (that is the endpoint of track A for both\nwide and compact systems) is located beyond RSTOP , PDISC < PRAD even\nfor L = 2 \u00d7 1037 ergs/s and the accretion can not resume. The growth of\npressure indicated by track B is not sufficient to allow disc formation. This\nmeans that for a wide system once a drop of the mass\u2013transfer rate has\nstarted the radio ejection, a subsequent restoration of the original mass\u2013\ntransfer rate is unable to quench the ejection process (as already pointed\nout by Ruderman, Shaham, & Tavani 1989).\nWe note that the radio ejection mechanism proposed here can also work if\nthe variations of the mass\u2013transfer rate are determined by the secular evolution\nrather than by a transient behaviour. Especially in this case, once the situation\ndescribed in cases Iw, IIw, & IIIw occurs, the subsequent orbital evolution is\nvery sensitive to the exact value of l and will be discussed elsewhere (Burderi\net al. , 2001, in preparation) leading in some cases to the disruption of the\ncompanion. This disruption mechanism (let us call it \"Roche lobe disruption\")\nis in many respects similar to the effect of the \"evaporation\" of the companion\nirradiated by the wind (composed of electromagnetic radiation and relativistic\nparticles) of a MSP (Tavani 1991). However several differences exists that will\nbe discussed elsewhere (Burderi et al. , 2001, in preparation).\nIn conclusion, while the evolution without a radio ejection phase implies\nthat a large fraction of the transferred mass is accreted onto the NS (because\nof the constraints imposed by the virial theorem), in this paragraph we have\ndemonstrated that the switch\u2013on of a radio pulsar (associated to a significant\ndrop in mass transfer) could determine ejection efficiencies close to 100% as the\nmatter is ejected before it falls into the deep gravitational potential well of the\nprimary.\nFor compact systems, the evolution outlined in Ic, IIc implies that radio\nejection is swiftly quenched by a resume of the original mass\u2013transfer rate, leading to the prediction that the amount of mass accreted is substantial. On the\nother hand, if a radio ejection starts in a wide system (IIw), IIIw implies that\nthe accretion is inhibited in the subsequent evolution. This suggests that wide\nsystems are the progenitors of the observed population of moderately massive\nand moderately fast spinning MSPs.\n5.\n\nWhere to search for ultra fast spinning NSs\n\nThe population synthesis calculations, described in \u00a72, which include significant\nmass ejection and different assumptions for the evolution of the magnetic field,\nshowed that the process of recycling in LMXBs can produce a significant amount\nof ultra fast spinning objects.

The parameters adopted are: \u03bc26 = 7.7, P\u22123 = 1.5, \u03b1 = 1,\n\u01eb = 1, n0.615 = 1, R6 = 1, m = 1.65.\n\n\f14\n\nBurderi\n\ndistributions of these sources, proved that there is always a non negligible probability for MSPs with P < Pmin (Cordes & Chernoff 1997). However, despite the\nlarge observational efforts over the recent years (D'Amico 2000, Edwards 2000,\nCrawford, Kaspi & Bell 2000), no pulsar with P < Pmin has been discovered so\nfar.\nIn \u00a74 we noted that if the NS is spinning very fast, a drop in the mass\ntransfer rate causes the switch\u2013on of a radio pulsar and starts a radio ejection\nphase. Moreover, a new phase of accretion is only possible if the orbital period\n< 1 ms\nis short enough. Thus, our model predicts that the spin up of a NS to P \u223c\n<\nrequires very close (Porb \u223c 1 h) binary systems.\nA consequence of the shortness of Porb is that the strong Doppler modulation of the pulsar period induced by the orbital motion provide a natural\nobservational bias against the detection of ultra fast spinning pulsars. All the\nalgorithms for the detection of periodicities from a source in a close binary\nsystem are, unavoidably, a trade\u2013off between computational capability and sensitivity: on each data set, they must perform a two dimensional search in the\nspace of the dispersion measure DM (related to the unknown distance of the\nobject), and acceleration (resulting from binary motion). Very short data sets\nreduce the Doppler modulations during the observation and reduce the CPU\ndemands, at the price of limiting the sensitivity (see e.g. Camilo et al. 2000).\nAs a consequence, Porb shorter than \u223c 90 min have been poorly searched up\nto now, even in the most favorable case of searches on a definite target (such\nas those in globular clusters), in which one of the parameters (DM) is known.\nThe two MSPs with the shortest orbital periods, 96 min and 102 min, have\nbeen just detected in the globular clusters 47 Tuc (Camilo et al. 2000) and NGC\n6544 (D'Amico et al. 2000), whereas in the galactic field the best case is that of\nPSR J2051\u22120827 (Porb = 2.37 h). This observational bias would be worse in the\npresence of eclipses (favoured in very close binary pulsar systems, Nice 2000), in\ncase of large duty cycles of the pulsed signal, in case of low radio luminosity, and\nstrong interstellar scintillation, phenomena which have already been suggested\nto explain the elusiveness of SMSPs (Possenti 2000).\nAknowledgments\nThis work was supported by a grant by the Italian Ministero dell' Universit\u00e0 e\ndella Ricerca Scientifica (Cofin-99-02-02).\nReferences\nAlpar, M.A., Cheng, A.F., Ruderman, M.A., & Shaham, J. 1982, Nature, 300, 728\nBhattacharya, D. 1995, in X\u2013ray Binaries, ed.
