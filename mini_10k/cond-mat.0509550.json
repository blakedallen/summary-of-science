In addition to the widely-accepted\nphase diagrams in all physical dimensions, a plethora of additional, weaker\nAnderson transitions are found, characterized by the long-distance behavior of\nstates. Critical disorders are found for Anderson transitions at which the\nasymptotically dominant sector of augmented space changes for all states at the\nsame disorder. At fixed disorder, critical energies are also found at which the\nlocalization properties of states are singular. Under the approximation of\nsingle-parameter scaling, this phase diagram reduces to the widely-accepted one\nin 1, 2 and 3 dimensions. In two dimensions, in addition to the Anderson\ntransition at infinitesimal disorder, there is a transition between two localized\nstates, characterized by a change in the nature of wave function decay.\n\n2\n\n\f1. The Anderson Model\n\nOne of the fundamental questions about the electronic structure of a\nmaterial is whether it is metallic or insulating, a distinction which reduces to\nwhether the electronic states carry currents (time-reversal doublets), or whether\nthey cannot carry currents (time-reversal singlets). The nature of electronic\nstates depends on interactions between electrons and ions, the structure of the\nmaterial, as well as on the interactions between electrons and other excitations.\nWhile the states of independent electrons in crystalline structures are well\nunderstood, the effects of structural disorder and interactions between electrons\ncontinue to be studied. Of these two, structural disorder seems the simpler,\nalthough many aspects of non-interacting electronic states in two-dimensional\nand three-dimensional disordered systems remain controversial. This paper\naddresses the breakdown, with increasing structural disorder, of the metallic\nstate in which the quasi-electrons near the Fermi level move independently.\nThe Anderson model [1] is a minimal Hamiltonian for independent\nelectrons in a disordered potential. The hopping part of the model is periodic\nwith a single tight-binding orbital on each site of a lattice, which is taken here to\nbe hypercubic of dimension D (a chain, square, or cubic lattice in D=1, 2, or 3,\nrespectively), and with the same hopping matrix-element between each pair of\n\n3\n\n\fnearest-neighbor orbitals. The disordered structure produces a disordered\nelectronic potential which is included in the model as disorder in the energies of\nthe orbitals; they are taken independently from some distribution, usually a top\nhat. The Anderson model neglects interactions between electrons, so it only\napplies to the quasi- electrons close to the Fermi level in a metal, where\ninteractions become arbitrarily small. Hence, this model describes the\nbreakdown of a metallic state with increasing disorder. In terms of operators\n{\u03c6\u03b1} which annihilate electrons in the orbitals located on the lattice of sites\n{R\u03b1}, the Anderson Hamiltonian is,\n\nH = \u2211 \u03b5\u03b1 \u03c6\u03b1 \u03c6\u03b1 + h \u2211 \u03c6\u03b1 \u03c6\u03b2,\n+\n\n\u03b1\n\n+\n\n(1)\n\n\u03b2\u2208\u03b1\n\nwhere \u03b5\u03b1 is the energy of the orbital at R\u03b1, taken independently for each orbital\nfrom the distribution \u03c1(\u03b5), h is the hopping matrix-element, and the sums are\nover sites \u03b1 and sites \u03b2 which are nearest-neighbors of \u03b1.\nDespite its simplicity, it is difficult to say much about the stationary\nstates of the Anderson Hamiltonian, other than in the small or large disorder\nlimits where the width W of the distribution of site-energies is respectively\n4\n\n\fmuch smaller or much larger than h. The problem is that the random energies\nmake the orbitals inequivalent, and there are an infinite number of them\ndiffering by arbitrarily small energies. The consequence of this infinite quasidegeneracy is that perturbation methods do not converge because energy\ndenominators are too small. Moreover, the stationary states of finite subsystems\ndo not converge with increasing size, because each state in a finite subsystem\nhybridizes strongly with the infinite number of states outside the subsystem\nwhich are arbitrarily close in energy.\nFor intermediate disorders, only quantities such as densities of\nstates and related Green functions can be calculated and this must be done nonperturbatively. Scaling [2] is widely used to interpolate between the small and\nlarge disorder limits; and numerical approaches range from numerical scaling\n[3,4] to sampling the densities of states in various ways such as level\ndistributions [5]. Numerical results are typically noisy due to slow convergence\nwith the number of samples of orbital-energies, but despite the noise there seem\nto be significant disagreements between numerical methods, especially in two\ndimensions[6-13]. It is difficult to see how these issues can be resolved by\nadvances in computers or computational methods, so analytic results are\nneeded. In addition to single-parameter scaling [2] and apart from the work\n\n5\n\n\fpresented in this paper, there are two other analytical approaches to this\nproblem: the first is the construction of effective field theories [14] leading to\nthe non-linear sigma model, and the second is infinite-order perturbation theory\n[15] leading to diffusion poles in the electronic Green function.\nIn parallel with the efforts described above, there has been rigorous\nmathematical work [16-23] to establish the basic properties of the Anderson\nmodel. While the extended properties of states in ordered systems are well\nunderstood, one of the challenges to the rigorous approach has been to show\nthat sufficient disorder makes all states exponentially localized [16]. One of the\nsurprising properties of the Anderson model is that there is no feature in the\ndensity of states (averaged density of states, but not projected densities of\nstates) [24] at energies separating extended from localized states. This has been\nshown rigorously for a number of examples [17, 18]. Although the work\ndescribed in this paper characterizes the metallic phase as having broken timereversal symmetry, the mathematical approach emphasizes the classification of\nspectra into point, absolutely continuous, and singular-continuous [17, 19].\nThe purpose of this article is to present an analytic approach to the\nAnderson Hamiltonian that does not depend on any scaling hypothesis [2], is\nnon- perturbative [15], and does not proceed from the direct assumption of a\n\n6\n\n\fGaussian distribution of disorder potentials [14], and the concomitant reliance\non field-theoretic methods. The problem with a scaling hypothesis is just that it\nis a hypothesis, and the problems with perturbation theory are mentioned above.\nOur concern with the Gaussian distribution is that the spectral properties of\nbounded operators can differ qualitatively from the spectral properties of\nunbounded operators. The Anderson Hamiltonian has the former quality, and\nthis should be taken into account in calculating its properties. The fieldtheoretic approach works directly from a Gaussian distribution of disorder\npotentials [14], unbounded and not obviously valid for this system. Our\napproach shares something in common with the conventional field-theoretic\napproach, namely the strategy of removing the disorder so as to leave a pure,\neffective Hamiltonian in which the electronic degrees of freedom are no longer\nindependent but experience an interaction from integrating out the disorder.\nHowever, since we purposefully reject the Gaussian distribution at the outset,\nour analysis uses a different methodology. In particular, it avoids the replica\nlimit and the introduction of supersymmetry.\nThe first analytic method used in this work is projection, a\ntransformation of the model in which only those states which couple to some\nparticular state are retained. As is shown below, the Anderson model can be\n\n7\n\n\fprojected exactly and analytically onto extended states, with the weak law of\nlarge numbers eliminating disorder from the matrix-elements of the transformed\nmodel, because each one depends on an infinite number of infinitesimal\ncontributions from independent orbital-energies with well behaved distributions.\nDisorder remains in the transformed model, but is represented in the basis set of\nextended states by expansion coefficients for the various site-orbitals which\ndepend on the random site-energies. This transformed model is a variant of the\naugmented space representation[25,26] for the average electronic structure of\nrandom alloys; however the augmented space generated here is based on\nextended states rather than localized orbitals as in its application to random\nalloys. Recently, calculations using averaged quantities[27] in the spirit of the\noriginal derivation of augmented space [26] have produced phase diagrams\nintermediate between the results presented here and those of scaling theory.\nFor a physical picture of the Anderson model in augmented space,\nthink of the extended states in the projection as sites on a new lattice. Taking\nthis approach, the action of the hopping term in the Hamiltonian, the second\nterm in Eq. 1, can be expressed as the sum of translations of the extended states\nby each of the nearest-neighbor displacements, hopping on the new lattice. The\nrandom potential, the first term in Eq. 1, multiplies the component of the\n\n8\n\n\fextended state on each site by the value of the random potential at that site,\nproducing a new extended state which is unrelated to any translation of the old\none. In contrast to hopping, think of this new extended state as an internal\nchange in the site on the new lattice, a kind of 'spin' on the new lattice. The\nresulting picture of augmented space is an electron hopping on a lattice of spins\nwith an interaction between the electron and the spin on the site it occupies.\nThe mathematical formulation of this transformation is presented in the next\nSection.\nOne important difference between the Anderson model in\naugmented space and position space is that while the number of sites in the\nAnderson model is countable, the number of extended states is uncountable. As\na consequence of the uncountable dimension of this state-space, the evolution of\nthe system is non-ergodic in the sense that, starting from a single extended state,\nthe system can never explore more than an infinitesimal fraction of the extended\nstates. As parameters in the model change, the system's evolution can shift\nfrom one subspace of extended states to another, producing one of the two kinds\nof phase transition in the model. Lest the reader be concerned that somehow the\nAnderson model has grown during projection, it is important to point out that\nthe extended states are limits of combinations of site-orbitals, so the projected\n\n9\n\n\fmodel is no larger than the original model including the limiting states. Indeed,\nit is just the limiting properties of states which determine whether they are\nmetallic or insulating, and these limiting properties are explicit in projection.\nIn previous work[13], augmented space was used to obtain a\nvariational expression for the edges of the band of states which are\nexponentially localized in augmented space. These band edges agree with\nperturbative results for the mobility edges at small disorder in three dimensions\n[10] and with localization edges in one and two dimensions[10]; and at\nintermediate disorder these band edges agree with numerical results obtained\nfrom the recursion method[4,12,13].\nThe second analytic method used here is path-counting in order to\ndetermine which parts of augmented space dominate the system's evolution.\nOne of the puzzles of previous results[13] is that the width of the band of states,\nlocalized in augmented space, increases monotonically with disorder, even at\ndisorders much larger than needed to localize all states in position space. In the\nprevious paper it was argued that in low dimension or at large disorders where\nall states are localized in position space, these band edges are singularities in the\nlocalization length of exponentially localized states, and don't separate extended\nstates from localized states.\n\n10\n\n\fNumerical results from the recursion method [13] suggested what is\nshown in this work, that there are in fact two distinct kinds of phase boundary in\nthe Anderson model, both continuous in the sense that the energy of states (free\nenergy at zero temperature) varies continuously with W and h. The first kind of\ntransition is characterized by a singular change in the sector of augmented space\nwhich dominates the asymptotics of the states as W changes for fixed h. It\nincludes the Anderson transitions at zero disorder in one and two dimensions as\nwell as well as the Anderson transition at non-zero disorder in three dimensions,\nwhere the entire band of states changes its localization properties at a critical\nvalue of disorder. These transitions of the Anderson kind also include\ntransitions from power-law to exponential, from extended to power-law, and\npossibly many other subtler transitions. It is the characterization of this first\nkind of transition which is the main result of this work. The second kind of\ntransition is characterized as a singular change in localization properties as the\nenergy varies for fixed disorder. It includes the mobility edges in three\ndimensions, but also includes localization transitions from power-law to\nexponentially localized states in two and three dimensions, as well as singular\nchanges in the exponential localization length.\nThe paper is organized into seven further Sections. In Sec. 2 a new\n\n11\n\n\fderivation of the transformation of the Anderson model to augmented space is\npresented. In the next Sec. asymptotic properties of the states in augmented\nspace are related to the different phases of the Anderson model. The\nasymmetric Cayley tree is solved in Sec. 4 as a simplified version of the\nAnderson model in augmented space and this leads to an approximate phase\ndiagram for the Anderson model. In Sec. 5, analytic expressions are obtained\nfor critical disorders of the full Anderson model transformed into augmented\nspace. The approximation of single-parameter scaling is applied to the phase\ndiagram resulting from this work, and it is shown that this reproduces the usual\nscaling phase diagram in Sec. 6. In Sec. 7, the results of this work are compared\nwith field-theoretic and perturbative approaches, and in the final section, the\nconclusions of this work are summarized.\n\n2. The Anderson Model in Augmented Space\n\nThere are few analytic results for the Anderson model, especially\naway from the limits where the width of the distribution of site-energies is\neither very large or very small compared to h. The transformation to augmented\nspace is analytic and exact, and applies for all disorders and all distributions of\nsite-energies which are well-behaved, in the sense that their moments determine\n\n12\n\n\fthe distribution. The idea behind this transformation is projection of the model\nonto a basis {\u03a6s} of distorted waves which are taken to be either states, or the\noperators which annihilate those states, depending on what is convenient in the\ncontext of the discussion. The distorted waves are constructed from\npolynomials {pn(\u03b5)} which are orthonormal[28] with respect to the distribution\n\u03c1(\u03b5) of the site-energies in the sense that \u222bpn(\u03b5)pm(\u03b5)\u03c1(\u03b5)d\u03b5 is \u03b4n,m. The\n\ntransformation begins with \u03a60, an extended state which has coefficient one for\nevery site-orbital in the Anderson model. The general element of the new basis\nis\n\n\u03a6s = \uf0e5 {\uf0d5 ps(\u03b2)(\u03b5\u03b1+\u03b2)} \u03c6\u03b1,\n\u03b1\n\n(2)\n\n\u03b2\n\nwhere s is a vector whose components {s(\u03b2)} are the degrees of orthogonal\npolynomials {ps(\u03b2)(\u03b5)}, one for each site \u03b2, and \u03b5\u03b1+\u03b2 is the energy of the orbital at\nR\u03b1+R\u03b2. These states are extended over the entire system, but the coefficients of\n\nindividual site-orbitals in these states depend on the disordered potential.\nThe most important property of the {\u03a6s} is that they are\northonormal to one another, as is shown by the following argument. For\n13\n\n\fextended states such as the {\u03a6s}, the inner product must be renormalized from\nthe sum of products of corresponding components, to the average over all sites\nof the products of corresponding components,\n\n(\u03a6s, \u03a6s') = <\uf0d5 ps(\u03b2)(\u03b5\u03b1+\u03b2) ps'(\u03b2)(\u03b5\u03b1+\u03b2)>\u03b1\n\n(3)\n\n\u03b2\n\nIn the above product, the distribution over \u03b1 of ps(\u03b2)(\u03b5\u03b1+\u03b2) ps'(\u03b2)(\u03b5\u03b1+\u03b2) is\nindependent for each choice of \u03b2 because the energies of different sites are\nindependent of one another. As a result, the average of this product over \u03b1 is\nthe product for different \u03b2 of the averages over \u03b1 giving,\n\n(\u03a6s, \u03a6s') = <\uf0d5 ps(\u03b2)(\u03b5\u03b1+\u03b2) ps'(\u03b2)(\u03b5\u03b1+\u03b2)>\u03b1 = \uf0d5 <ps(\u03b2)(\u03b5\u03b1+\u03b2) ps'(\u03b2)(\u03b5\u03b1+\u03b2)>\u03b1. (4)\n\u03b2\n\n\u03b2\n\nFrom the weak law of large numbers, the averages, <ps(\u03b2)(\u03b5\u03b1+\u03b2) ps'(\u03b2)(\u03b5\u03b1+\u03b2)>\u03b1, over\nan infinite number of sites are simply the orthonormality relations for the\npolynomials: (\u03a6s, \u03a6s') is just \u03b4s,s' , that is zero unless s and s' are identical\ncomponent by component.\nThe second important property of the {\u03a6s} is that as a basis for the\n14\n\n\fAnderson Hamiltonian, they produce a matrix which is sparse in the sense that\neach of the {\u03a6s} has non-zero matrix elements with only a few others, as can be\nseen from the following argument. In additional to being orthonormal, the\npolynomials {pn(\u03b5)} satisfy a three term recurrence relation[28],\n\u03b5pn(\u03b5)=bn+1pn+1(\u03b5)+anpn(\u03b5)+bn-1pn-1(\u03b5), where the parameters {an} and {bn} depend\n\non the particular choice of distribution for the site-energies. So, when the first\nterm of the Hamiltonian in Eq. 1 is applied to one of the {\u03a6s} from Eq. 2, it\nmultiplies each component for each site by the site-energy, and the recurrence\nfor the polynomials relates this product to a sum of polynomials. As a result,\nthe disordered potential changes the first component of the spin vector s as can\nbe seen in the first three terms of the transformed Hamiltonian in Eq. 5. The\nsecond term of the Anderson Hamiltonian translates components of the {\u03a6s} to\neach of their nearest-neighbor site, which is the same as translating the\ncomponents of the spin vector s to their nearest neighbors, giving the fourth\nterm in the transformed Hamiltonian,\n\nH = \uf0e5{bn+1 \u03a6s+1 \u03a6s + an \u03a6s \u03a6s + bn \u03a6s-1 \u03a6s + h \uf0e5\u03a6s' \u03a6s},\n+\n\n+\n\n+\n\n\u03b4\n\ns\n\n15\n\n(5)\n\n\fwhere \u03b4 is a nearest neighbor displacement, s'(\u03b2+\u03b4)= s(\u03b2), {an} and {bn} are the\ncoefficients in the recurrence for the orthogonal polynomials , and 1 is the\nvector with unit component for the site at the origin and zero for all other\ncomponents.\nThe localization of states is determined by their asymptotic\nproperties in augmented space. For example, states whose contributions from\nthe {\u03a6s} decrease exponentially with the number of hops from \u03a60 to \u03a6s are\ndominated by just a few of the \u03a6s near \u03a60 so, like these \u03a6s, they are extended in\nposition space. At the opposite extreme, states whose contributions from the\n{\u03a6s} are independent of the number of hops from {\u03a6s} are superpositions of\nmany of the {\u03a6s}, and so cancel at most sites, because their components are\nrandom and independent, producing states which are localized in positionspace.\nIn this asymptotic region, the hopping matrix-elements of H are still\nh because the lattice is periodic, and from the theory of orthogonal polynomials\n\n[28], the asymptotic matrix-elements for the potential are determined by the\nedges of the distribution of site-energies (assumed continuous), which may be\ntaken to be \u00b1W/2 without loss of generality. From this, the asymptotic value of\nthe {bn} is W/4, and the asymptotic value of the {an} is zero; whereas the {bn}\n16\n\n\fdiverge for a Gaussian distribution, indicated the important difference between\nbounded and unbounded distributions. Consider one of the basis states \u03a6s in\nthis asymptotic region of H, where almost all the sites near the origin have nonzero spins. First, \u03a6s is coupled by h to 2D (a hypercubic lattice in Ddimensions) states where the spins have been shifted by a nearest-neighbor\ntranslation. Second, \u03a6s is coupled by W/4 to two states for which the spin at the\norigin differs by \u00b11. This finite coordination of all states is one of the properties\nwhich make the Anderson model simple in augmented space.\nThe next important property of H is the structure of closed paths,\nsequences of matrix-elements which form loops. First there are the shortest\nclosed paths, from \u03a6s to one of its 2(D+1) neighbors and back, which do not\neven count as loops because there are no intermediate hops. The smallest loops\nare those associated with the original lattice, four h-hops around a square in two\nand higher dimensions, and the various larger loops for hypercubic lattices with\nD>1. The smallest loops which include both h-hops and W/4-hops are of length\neight, alternating four h-hops and four W/4-hops. These loops begins with a\nchange of the spin on 0, a nearest-neighbor translation of all spins, another\nchange of the spin on 0, the inverse of the nearest-neighbor translation, the\ninverse of the first spin change, the first nearest-neighbor translation, the inverse\n17\n\n\fof the second spin change, and finally the inverse of the nearest neighbor\ntranslation. A schematic of this structure is shown in Fig. 1. These and larger\nloops may be understood in terms of changing the configuration of spins by\nchanging individual spins in different orders. Starting with one configuration\nwe can change one of the spins by translating that spin to the origin, and then\nchange another spin in the configuration by translating that one to the origin,\nand so on, until the desired final configuration is reached. Each pair of paths\nfrom the initial to final spin-configurations makes up a loop, provided there is\nnot some intermediate configuration in common.\n\n3. Phase Transitions in Augmented Space\n\nAn Anderson model is defined by its lattice, which is taken here to\nbe hypercubic in D-dimensions, and one, dimensionless parameter W/h, the\nratio of the width W of the distribution of orbital-energies to the nearestneighbor hopping matrix-element h. Models with the same lattice and W/h have\nsimilar states. Hopping to more distant neighbors can be added, but there is no\nevidence this changes the model qualitatively unless the hopping is of infinite\nrange. The states of the Anderson model have another dimensionless parameter\nE/h, the ratio of the energy of the state to h. A pair of states from different\n\n18\n\n\fAnderson models with the same lattice and W/h are almost certain to be similar\nif they have the same E/h.\nIn order for the model to exhibit different phases for different\nvalues of E/h and W/h, it must have states which differ qualitatively from one\nanother. Finite combinations of site-orbitals are qualitatively the same, so the\npresence of multiple phases requires infinite numbers of site-orbitals, and it is\nthe asymptotic behavior of states, i.e. their localization properties, which\ndistinguishes the phases in this model. One goal of work on the Anderson\nmodel is to calculate the phase diagrams for different lattices in terms of W/h\nand E/h. This has proved difficult for reasons discussed above, and because it is\nalways difficult to determine asymptotic properties of discrete equations such as\nthe Schr\u00f6dinger equation for the Anderson model.\nSince the Anderson model in augmented space is a projection of the\noriginal model, the asymptotic properties of states in augmented space are\nrelated to those in position-space. The trend in this relationship is clear from\nthe localization properties of combinations of the distorted waves which are the\nbasis in augmented space, introduced in Sec. 2. These localization properties,\nlocalized to extended, invert in going from augmented space to position-space,\nbut the boundaries between different phases occur at the same values of disorder\n\n19\n\n\fand energy.\nAnalyzing the Anderson model in augmented space makes it\npossible to separate the properties of states which depend on W from those\nwhich depend on E, as is explained in what follows. In position space, the siteorbitals are countable, but in augmented space, the spin configurations {\u03a6s} are\nnot countable, as can be seen by interpreting each spin as a digit in a real\nnumber. The importance of this larger basis is that the evolution of a single\nstate, say exp{-iHt} \u03a60, is a superposition of the powers of H on \u03a6o, a space of\ncountable dimension, and therefore an infinitesimal fraction of augmented space\nwhich has uncountable dimension. As a result, it is possible for \u03a60 to evolve\nonto different subspaces of countable dimension depending only on W through\nH, and this makes possible phase transitions which depend only on W, not on E,\nthe Anderson transitions. Within subspaces of countable dimension which\nsupport the evolution of \u03a60, there can still be states with different localization\nproperties, so there is a second qualitative distinction between states and hence\na second kind of phase transition, the mobility transitions, of this model.\n\n20\n\n\f4. Exactly Solvable Models\n\nAs an example of a model in augmented space with phase\ntransitions similar to the Anderson model, consider a Cayley tree with\ncoordination four \u2013 each vertex on the tree is connected by edges to four other\nvertexes, and there are no loops in the graph. Take the vertexes of the tree to\nrepresent basis states in augmented space, and take the edges of the tree to\nrepresent non-zero matrix-elements of the Anderson Hamiltonian in augmented\nspace. From each vertex, take two of the edges to have hopping matrixelements h, assumed positive, and take two edges to have matrix-elements of\nthe potential W/4. This is illustrated in Fig. 2. The asymmetric Cayley tree\ndiffers from the symmetric Cayley tree in having more than one kind of edge.\nLocally (out to fourth neighbors), the asymmetric Cayley tree is\nidentical to the Anderson model in augmented space far from \u03a60 for an infinite\nchain of equally spaced sites, D=1, with a semi-elliptical distribution of orbitalenergies of width W (an=0, bn=W/4). At fourth neighbors, changing spins in\ndifferent orders leads to the same state for the Anderson model, but different\nstates for the Cayley tree. Another difference between the two models is that all\nvertexes of the Cayley tree are equivalent, but for the Anderson model \u03a60 is\nspecial.\n21\n\n\fWhen h exceeds W/4, it is clear that the system evolves\npreferentially along h-hops so that the asymptotics of states are dominated by\nh-hops, one phase of the system. When W/4 exceeds h, W/4-hopping is\n\npreferred, and the asymptotics of states are dominated by W/4-hops, the second\nphase of the system. When h=W/4, the tree is symmetric as is the propagation\nof the system, and the asymptotics of the states is critical. For the asymmetric\nCayley tree all the states change character as the disorder W moves through its\ncritical value of 4h, so this is an example of the Anderson type of phase\ntransition in augmented space.\nA mobility transition occurs as E varies for fixed W. The simplest\nexample of this kind of transition occurs at the critical value of disorder Wc ,\nwhere both kinds of edges have the same matrix-elements and the Cayley tree is\nsymmetric. The energies of stationary states coupled to a particular basis state\nare those which contribute to the projected density of states for a single vertex\nof the tree. The simplest way to calculate this is with a hierarchy of equations\nfor the projected resolvent (or Greenian),\n\nR(E) = <\u039e0[E \u2013 HC] \u039e0 >,\n-1\n\n+\n\n(6)\n\n22\n\n\fwhere HC is the Hamiltonian for the Cayley tree, \u039e0 annihilates the state\nrepresented by one of the vertexes on the tree, and the angle brackets mean the\nvacuum expectation value.\nThe projected resolved R(E) can be calculated by relating it to other\nprojected resolvents, noting that site \u039e0 is coupled to four neighboring vertexes\nby the matrix-element h (spin-hops and lattice-hops have the same matrixelements in the symmetric case). Define a second projected resolvent,\n\nG(E) = <\u039e1[E \u2013 HC0] \u039e1 >,\n-1\n\n+\n\n(7)\n\nfor any of these neighboring vertexes (they are equivalent) with the Hamiltonian\nHC0, which is HC with \u039e0 removed. Some matrix algebra gives the first of the\nhierarchical equations,\n\n-1\n\n2\n\nR(E) = E \u2013 4 h G(E).\n\n(8)\n\nThe second equation comes from noting that \u039e1 is coupled by h to three vertexes\nother than \u039e0, and the projected resolvents for these vertexes (excluding \u039e1 from\nthe Hamiltonian) are also G(E) because the Cayley tree is infinite with\n23\n\n\fequivalent vertexes, leading to\n\n-1\n\n2\n\nG(E) = E \u2013 3 h G(E).\n\n(9)\n\nEquation 9 is quadratic in G(E), so it can be solved and the result\nsubstituted into Eq. 8 to give R(E). For real E, the imaginary part of R(E) is \u03c0\ntimes the projected density of states which comes out to be,\n\nn(E) = (2 /\u03c0) \u221a(12h \u2013 E ) /(16 h \u2013 E ), for -2 \u221a3 h \u2264 E \u2264 2 \u221a3 h,\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\n2\n\nand zero otherwise.\n\n(10)\n\nNote that the model has states with energies between -4h and +4h, the extremal\nstates are marked by the zeros of the denominator in Eq. 10, but only those\nbetween -2\u221a3h and +2\u221a3h couple to single basis states. The states in the range\n\u00b12\u221a3h decrease exponentially with distance (number of edges) steeply enough\nto have significant weight on the original vertex, while the states outside this\nrange do not decrease with distance steeply enough for there to be any density\n24\n\n\fof states on the original vertex. For example the state at E=4h is 1 on every\nvertex of the tree, while the state at 2\u221a3h has amplitude 1\u20442 on each of the nearest\nneighbors of the original vertex, 1/(2\u221a3), on each of the next neighbors, 1/6 on\neach third neighbor, and so forth decreasing by a factor of 1/\u221a3 on each\nsucceeding shell after the first. As a result, there are two critical energies\nEc=\u00b12\u221a3h where the projected density of states, and hence the localization\nproperties of states, are singular for this model; and there are the two extremal\nenergies of the model EL=\u00b14h, the Lifshitz edges, at which the properties of\nstates are also singular.\nAway from the critical disorder, there are similar critical energies,\nbut the algebra gets more complicated. As before, the simplest approach is to\nset up hierarchical equations for projected resolvents. Take R(E) to be the\nprojected resolvent for one vertex of the tree. It is coupled by lattice-hops to\ntwo vertexes whose projected resolvents are taken to be G(E), defined with a\nHamiltonian excluding the original vertex making G(E) different from R(E).\nThe original vertex is also coupled by spin-hops to two vertexes whose\nprojected resolvents are taken to be S(E), again defined by a Hamiltonian\nexcluding the original vertex so S(E) is different from R(E) and G(E). In terms\nof G(E) and S(E),\n25\n\n\fR(E)-1 = E \u2013 2 h2 G(E) \u2013 W2 S(E)/ 8.\n\n(11)\n\nSimilar arguments lead to equations for G(E) and S(E),\n\n-1\n\n2\n\n2\n\nG(E) = E \u2013 h G(E) \u2013 W S(E)/ 8,\n\n-1\n\n2\n\n2\n\nS(E) = E \u2013 2 h G(E) \u2013 W S(E)/ 16.\n\n(12)\n\n(13)\n\nEquations 11-13 combine to give a quartic equation for R(E), which\nis where the algebra becomes complicated. Just as for the symmetric case there\nare two critical energies, which are the edges of the band of states sufficiently\nlocalized to contribute to the projected density of states on a single vertex. In\naddition there are two Lifshitz edges at EL=\u00b1(2h+W/2) which are the energies of\nthe state taking value one on each vertex and the state alternating plus and\nminus one on neighboring vertexes. Figure 3 shows the phase diagram for the\nasymmetric Cayley tree in augmented space including both the Anderson\ntransition for all energies at the critical disorder, and the mobility transitions at\ncritical energies for various disorders. Since the states of the Anderson model\n\n26\n\n\fin augmented space form a continuum in the energy-disorder plane of Fig. 3,\nthe transitions between different phases are continuous.\n\n5. Critical Disorders and Energies for the Anderson Model\n\nFor the Anderson model in augmented space, loops in the graph\nmake the phase diagram much more difficult to calculate and much more\ncomplicated than the phase diagram for the asymmetric Cayley tree, which has\nno loops. One source of loops in the Anderson model is that spins can be\nchanged in different orders to produce the same state, and another is that for D\ngreater than one, the lattices also contain loops. In contrast, the asymmetric\nCayley tree has no loops in the lattice, because it is one-dimensional, and\nchanging the spins in different orders leads to different vertexes on the tree.\nWhen loops are present, determining asymptotics of states is more complicated\nthan the comparison of products of matrix-elements which works for a tree.\nIn common with the asymmetric Cayley tree, the Anderson model\nin augmented space has two different kinds of matrix-elements: those for spinhops and those for lattice-hops. This, together with the uncountable basis,\nmakes possible multiple phases depending upon which directions in augmented\nspace dominate the evolution of the system. At time t, the coefficient of \u03a6s in a\n27\n\n\fstate which started as \u03a60 at t=0, is\n\n\u03c8s(t) = (2\u03c0i) \u222b <\u03a60 | (E \u2013 H) | \u03a6s> e\n-1\n\n-1\n\n-iEt\n\ndE\n\n(14)\n\nwhere the integral is around a contour which encloses the energies of all states.\nThe leading term in the time-dependence of \u03c8s(t) is \u03bcs(-it) /N!, where N is the\nN\n\nsmallest power of H having a non-zero matrix-element \u03bcs between \u03a60 and \u03a6s.\nIn terms of the matrix elements of H, <\u03a60 |H | \u03a6s> is the sum of products of\nN\n\nmatrix-elements of H along all the paths with the minimum number of hops N\nfrom \u03a60 and \u03a6s, the direct paths. Consequently, as s goes to infinity, N goes to\ninfinity, and the leading contribution of \u03a6s to the state is proportional to \u03bcs.\nHence, the phase of the system is determined by the distant \u03a6s with the largest\n\u03bcs; that is the distant vertexes whose direct paths dominate, consistent with the\n\nresult for the asymmetric Cayley tree.\nIn the case of the asymmetric Cayley tree, the asymptotic behavior\nof states is easy to determine from the above arguments, and it is shown here\nthat they lead to a critical disorder, Wc=4h, which was derived in Sec. 4 by a\ndifferent argument. Note that on a Cayley tree there is a unique direct path of N\n28\n\n\fhops from the origin to a given vertex. The moment \u03bcs is the product of matrixelements, either h or W/4, along the direct path. Hence the asymptotics of\nstates on the asymmetric Cayley tree are dominated by the vertexes whose\ndirect paths consist entirely of either h-hops or W/4-hops, whichever is larger,\nleading to an Anderson transition when they are equal.\nTurning now to the Anderson model in augmented space, for W=0,\n\u03a60 and other Bloch states are stationary solutions of the Hamiltonian, so there\n\nare no asymptotic tails in augmented space. However for W infinitesimally\ngreater than zero, the states acquire asymptotic tails, so there is a qualitative\nchange in the states and hence a critical disorder W0=0.\nFor W greater than zero, but still small compared to h, lattice-hops\nmust dominate the asymptotics of the states. The range of W for which this\ndominance persists can be calculated using the arguments above. For\nhypercubic lattices in D-dimensions, the sites with the largest weight from\ndirect paths of length Dn are located at (\u00b1n,\u00b1n, ...\u00b1n) because this gives the\nmaximum number of permutations of the lattice-hops in different directions.\nDn\n\nD\n\nThe contribution from these direct paths is h (Dn)!/(n!) . Using Stirling's\nDn\n\napproximation for the factorial, this becomes (Dh) , for n large, and is precisely\nthe value which gives the exact width of the band of electronic states for the\n\n29\n\n\fordered lattice. Since the matrix-element for spin-hops is W/4, there is a\ntransition at the critical disorder W1 which leaves the contribution from direct\npaths unchanged when a lattice-hop is replaced by a spin-hop: W1=4Dh.\nIt might seem that for W greater than W1, paths consisting only of\nspin-hops should dominate, but this is not the case, because of loops due to the\nequivalence of changing spins in different orders. Direct paths are generated by\nhops away from the origin, and those which alternate spin-hops with latticehops are especially numerous, because after each outward spin-hop, there are\nnot just D, but 2D, outward lattice-hops. As a result, paths which contain\nmixtures of lattice-hops and spin-hops can outweigh the paths which are pure\nspin-hops up to the limit where W/4=2Dh. This then corresponds to a second\ncritical disorder W2=8Dh. Counting the number of direct paths of various\nlengths from \u03a60 to \u03a6s is a difficult combinatorial problem, so it is not possible\nto say where in the interval between W1 and W2 there are additional critical\ndisorders. However, we can estimate bounds on critical disorders: \u03a6s can be\nreached by direct paths which are mixtures of spin and lattice-hops, and which\ndominate the purely spin-hopping paths, for disorders less than 4\u221a2Dh (5.657\n1/3\n\nDh) or even 4(3 )Dh (5.769 Dh).\nThere are possibilities of additional phases in the Anderson model.\n30\n\n\fFor example, in the case of the top hat distribution of site-energies, the matrixelement between \u03a60 and \u03a61 is (W/4)/(\u221a3/2) which is greater than W/4,\nenhancing contributions from paths which include spin-hops as well as latticehops. As a result, in this case there should be a transition at W=4Dh\u221a3/2, but\npresumably this is very weak, and has not yet been detected numerically. Since\nother matrix elements for the spin-hops can be greater than their asymptotic\nvalue, additional transitions are possible corresponding to different patterns of\nspin and lattice-hopping.\nIn addition to this plethora of critical values of the disorder, the\nAnderson model has critical energies where the density of states is singular.\nThese include van Hove singularities for ordered systems, but extend to\nsingularities in localization lengths, in power-laws, and in other localization\nproperties for disordered systems. The exact trajectories for mobility edges of\nthe asymmetric Cayley tree in Sec. 4 can be used to approximate the mobility\nedges of hypercubic lattices in the Anderson model by equating ordered\nbandwidths: h is replaced by Dh in Eqs. 11-13. This is not a variational bound\nas was used in previous work [13], but could be further improved by taking into\naccount variations in the number of paths to different sites on the hypercubic\nlattices. These critical energies together with the critical disorders are included\n31\n\n\fin the phase diagram for the Anderson model in Fig. 4. Again, the states fill the\nenergy-disorder plane and so the transitions are continuous.\nIt is useful to relate different phases in augmented space to their\nlocalization properties in position space. This can be done for the states at W=0\nwhich are Bloch states and clearly extended in position-space. The states of\nmodels with W>W2 consist of superpositions of random extended states in\nposition space. The random extended states cancel on almost all sites, so in the\nextreme case these states are localized on a single site, where the random\nextended states happen to interfere constructively, with energy close to the\nrandom energy of that single site. The large disorder limit of the Anderson\nmodel in position space gives this same result [29]. For D=1, i.e. one\ndimension, and W greater than zero, all states are exponentially localized, so as\ndisorder increases, the exponential localization becomes stronger and the\nvarious phase boundaries correspond to singularities in the dependence of the\nlocalization length on disorder or energy. Analytic results for small but nonzero disorders show that in D=2 the states are power-law localized, and in D=3\nthe states are extended [10]. Beyond these results, all that can be shown\nanalytically is that states become more localized with increasing disorder and\nthat the nature of the localization depends on the dimension of the system.\n\n32\n\n\f6. The Single-Parameter Scaling Approximation\n\nNumerical approaches to Anderson localization always require\nextrapolation from some finite system to an infinite limit. One well established\nmethod for doing this is finite-size scaling, which was applied by Pichard and\nSarma [30, 31, 32] to the dependence of localization lengths on the width of\nlong strips for two dimensions, and to the dependence of localization lengths on\nthe side of long bars for three dimensions. This work showed that two\ndimensions is marginal for the existence of extended states, and that power-law\nlocalization is present for weak disorder in two dimensions, but the conclusion\nof this work in Ref. 32 is that exponential localization takes over at the longest\nlength scales.\nSingle-parameter scaling makes the phenomenological assumption\nthat the metallic or insulating nature of a material is determined by the variation\nof just a single parameter, the conductance g across a hypercube (wire, square,\nor cube) with sides of length L. This approximation may be understood as\nbuilding the wave functions of large hypercubes out of those of small\nhypercubes by matching only their amplitudes at the boundaries and neglecting\nthe phase. In Ref. 2, the Authors go on to suppose that a smooth, nondecreasing, scaling function \u03b2(g(L)) = d Ln g(L)/ dLn L interpolates between the\n33\n\n\flimits of large g in which \u03b2(g(L)) is Ohmic taking the value D-2 (where D is the\ndimension of the system) and small g in which \u03b2(g(L)) is insulating and goes to\nLn g(L). If \u03b2(g(L)) is positive, the system scales to the metallic limit, and if\n\u03b2(g(L)) is negative, it scales to the insulating limit. For the critical value of the\n\nconductance separating metallic from insulating, \u03b2(g(L)) is zero.\nThe scaling function \u03b2(g(L)) can be calculated for different parts of\nthe phase diagram in Fig. 4 using previous results from analytic and numerical\nrecursion [10, 12, 13]. These results give the quantum mechanical\ntransmittance for an electron starting on a single site to propagate either to\ninfinity (analytic) or to a large distance, of order a thousand lattice constants,\n(numerical). The work of Landauer and B\u00fcttiker [33] relates this transmittance\nto a conductance from which Ohm's law gives a conductivity, taking into\naccount the geometry of the numerical recursion, which is conduction from the\nboundary of a single site to the boundary of a large or infinite realization the\nmodel. This is simply the conduction from a small circle to a large concentric\ncircle in two dimensions, or from a small sphere to a large concentric sphere in\nthree dimensions. The conductance of the hypercube is independent of its size\nin two dimensions, but increases as the length L of the edge in three dimensions.\nFor the one-dimensional Anderson model, recursion is trivial and\n34\n\n\fnon-zero disorder leads to a negative value of the scaling function producing the\ninsulating limit, consistent with the scaling phase diagram in which there is an\nAnderson transition at zero disorder. For arbitrarily small disorder in two\ndimensions, both analytic and numerical recursion calculations [10, 12, 13]\nshow that the transmittance away from a single site decreases as a negative\npower of the distance leading to \u03b2(g(L)) < 0. For the scaling function to take its\ncritical value zero, the transmittance would have to decrease as 1/Ln L , slower\nthan any power-law. For the two-dimensional Anderson model, this\napproximation makes all states insulating except those within the band at zero\ndisorder, again consistent with the scaling phase diagram in which there is just\nan Anderson transition at zero disorder.\nFor three dimensions, a similar calculation shows that the scaling\nfunction takes its critical value zero for a transmittance which decreases as 1/L\nwith distance L from a single site - a critical power-law. Analytic recursion [10]\nfor three dimensions shows that for small disorder the transmittance away from\na single site goes to a non-zero constant for large L, scaling to metallic. The\nasymptotics of states in augmented space shows that there is an Anderson\ntransition in three dimensions at W=12h, and numerical recursion [12,13] shows\nthat this transition is to a power-law dependence of the transmittance on L.\n\n35\n\n\fFrom [12] the trajectory of this critical power-law can be roughly estimated, and\nis sketched as a thin line in Fig. 4. There is qualitative agreement between this\ntrajectory and the most detailed phase diagram obtained from numerical scaling,\nFig. 1 from Ref. 7. We now attempt a comparison between these numerical\nresults and the present analytic results.\nThere is quantitative agreement between the present work and\nnumerical scaling on the critical disorder for the Anderson transition in the\nfollowing sense: In Fig. 4 of the present paper, the Anderson transition at\nW=12h , D=3, marks the disorder at which the slope of the scaling phase\n\nboundary is a minimum for positive energies; at larger disorders this phase\nboundary curves back to lower energies. In Fig. 1 of Ref. 7, this same\nminimum in the slope of the phase boundary also occurs at 12h to within the\naccuracy it can be estimated from that figure. There is also quantitative\nagreement between the disorder at which the phase boundary in Fig. 1 of Ref. 7\ncrosses zero energy, and the disorder at which the transmittance calculated in\nRef. 12 decreases as 1/L. However, this not a stringent test, because the\nresolution in disorder of the calculations in Ref. 12 is only \u00b12.\nOn the other hand, there is quantitative disagreement between this\nwork and Ref. 7 in the placement of the mobility edges for W=12h, at 10.2h and\n\n36\n\n\fabout 7.9h, respectively. The energy resolution of the calculations in Refs. 12\nand 13 is much better than the disorder resolution, and from [13] this critical\nenergy lies between 8.5h and 9.5h, which is inconsistent with the calculations\npresented here for the asymmetric Cayley tree, where we obtained the estimate\nof 10.2h. In Ref. [7], the estimate obtained also lies outside the range from Ref.\n[13]. For disorders less than 12h, our calculation of the phase boundary from\nthe asymmetric Cayley tree is consistent with the lower and numerical bounds\nin Ref. [13]; however, the calculation of Ref. [7] is not consistent with either of\nthose of Ref. [13]. Specifically, the phase boundaries of these various\napproaches are nested: the phase boundary in Ref. 7 lies inside the lower bound\nfrom Ref. 13 (a violation of the bound), which lies inside the numerical phase\nboundary from Ref. 13 (consistent with the bound), which lies inside the\nanalytic phase boundary calculated from the asymmetric Cayley tree in Sec. 4\n(also consistent with the bound).\nIn evaluating the above comparisons, it is important to keep in\nmind the inconsistency between the symmetry-breaking and scaling definitions\nof 'metallic' states. States with small power-law localization belong to timereversal singlets and so are insulating by symmetry, however their conductivity\naccording to [33] and Ohm's law scales to infinity on infinite length-scales. The\n\n37\n\n\freason for this inconsistency is that the metallic scaling limit depends on Ohm's\nlaw for which inelastic processes are implicit; however the Anderson model has\nno interactions and hence no inelastic processes.\nThe main difference between the results of this work and those of\nscaling is that the projection onto augmented space reveals a much wider range\nof qualitative behaviors for the asymptotics of states. Of particular importance\nis the time-reversal symmetry of states which is not addressed by scaling\ntheories. States belonging to time-reversal doublets are clearly metallic because\nthey can carry currents, but scaling includes as metallic some states which are\ntime-reversal singlets, namely those which are weakly power-law localized.\nWhile the asymptotics of some insulating states fall into simple classes such as\nexponential localization or power-law localization, augmented space reveals\nadditional, more subtle, distinctions which have not yet been characterized.\nCompounding the complexity of the model are the singularities in the energydependence of states for a fixed disorder; sometimes qualitative changes such as\nbetween time-reversal singlets and doublets, and sometimes just singularities in\na quantity such as the exponential localization length.\n\n38\n\n\f7. Comparison with Other Approaches\n\nThis work cannot be compared directly with field-theoretic\napproaches [14] because the field theories are defined on a continuum rather\nthan a lattice. However, it is clear when the bounded top-hat distribution of\nsite-energies is replaced by the unbounded Gaussian distribution in the\ntransformation to augmented space, the matrix-elements for spin-hops diverge\naccording to the recurrence relation for Hermite polynomials [28] which are\northogonal with respect to the Gaussian distribution. As a result, at sufficiently\nlong times, spin-hops always dominate the evolution of states, and the model\nhas only a single, strongly insulating phase for non-zero disorder. However,\ncomparing with the usual interpretation of the field-theoretic results, there is\nqualitative agreement with the work in this paper for three dimensions, but\nqualitative disagreement with this work in two dimensions where the transition\nto exponential localization of all states occurs when W=8h.\nApplication of infinite-order perturbation theory to the Anderson\nmodel produces diffusion poles[15]. While electronic transport must certainly\nbe diffusive if the electrons in the Anderson model are coupled to a heat bath,\nuncoupled, the states of the model have infinite lifetimes. In the metallic phase\nwhere the states belong to current-carrying, time-reversal doublets, these\n\n39\n\n\fcurrents also have infinite lifetimes, which seems inconsistent with diffusion.\nThe results presented above agree with the basic requirements of\nthe rigorous mathematical approach [16-23]: States are extended at zero or low\ndisorder and exponentially localized at sufficiently strong disorder. The\naverage density of states is smooth across mobility transitions, although this is\nnot explicitly proved here. Turning to the spectral classification of states, it is\nclear that states belonging to time-reversal doublets have normalizations\nproportional to the volume of the system, and so are part of the absolutely\ncontinuous spectrum of the model. States belonging to the point spectrum have\nnormalizations independent of the volume of the system, normalizable, and this\nspectrum is indeed dense. In addition, this work produces states whose\nnormalizations are proportional to a power of the volume of the system greater\nthan zero and less than one, so they belong to the singular-continuous spectrum\nwhose existence has been hypothesized in the mathematical approach, but not\ndemonstrated.\n\n8. Conclusions\n\nIn this paper the critical assumptions of several approaches to\nAnderson localization have been tested by the transformation to augmented\n\n40\n\n\fspace which leads to exact values for the critical disorders of some Anderson\ntransitions. These results agree with single-parameter scaling in that the\nAnderson transitions to non-conductive states occur at infinitesimal disorder in\none and two dimensions, but not in three dimensions. The results disagree with\nsingle-parameter scaling in two dimensions in that there is an additional\nAnderson transition at non-zero disorder in two dimensions, between two nonconductive states which differ in the way that they decay at large distances.\nFurthermore, the phase diagram resulting from this work reduces to that of\nnumerical scaling when the assumption of numerical scaling is combined with\nresults from numerical recursion. What this work adds to the results of\nnumerical scaling is the distinction between Anderson and mobility transitions,\nexact values for some of the Anderson transitions, and the existence of more\nAnderson transitions than was previously suspected.\nIn comparing this work with the results of field-theoretic methods,\nthe general pictures agree: Anderson transitions between current-carrying and\nnon-current-carrying states occur at zero disorder in one and two dimensions,\nbut not in three dimensions. As in the case of scaling theory, the differences are\nin the additional Anderson transitions. One of the purposes of this work is to\ntest the hypothetical equivalence of the bounded potential distributions in the\n\n41\n\n\fAnderson model with the unbounded Gaussian distributions in the field theory.\nTransformation to augmented space of an unbounded distribution of potentials\nleads to domination of the disorder, making it very difficult to see how the\nstates of the Anderson model can be other than exponentially localized for a\nGaussian potential distribution. Because of this, the general agreement between\nthis work and field-theoretic approaches is surprising - it may be that other\napproximations in the field-theoretic approach effectively cut off the tails of the\nGaussians.\nThe representation of the Anderson model in augmented space\nincorporates both the states of the model and their limiting states which\ndetermine the phases of the model. Path counting and calculation of projected\ndensities of states allow the phase boundaries to be located. That such a simple\nmodel as the Anderson model for quantum states in the presence of disorder can\nproduce such a complicated phase diagram continues to surprise and delight.\n\n42\n\n\fAcknowledgments\n\nWe are grateful to David Khmelnitskii, Ben Simons, Dietrich Belitz and\nEduardo Fradkin for helpful discussions.
