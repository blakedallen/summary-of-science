In addition, the\npresent analysis sheds a new light on the interpretation of recent experiments from literature.\n\nThe interaction of electromagnetic fields with discrete systems ranging from plasmonic nanoparticles 1,2 to biological cells 3 is governed by their polarizabilities and is strongly dependent on both\ndielectric and geometric properties of particles and surrounding medium. Metallic nanoparticles\n\u2217 To\n\nwhom correspondence should be addressed\nInstitute for Research and Development in Microtechnologies, Bucharest, Romania\n\u2021 Department of Physics, Texas Southern University, Houston, Texas 77004, USA\n\u00b6 International Center for Biodynamics, Bucharest, Romania\n\u00a7 International Center for Biodynamics, Bucharest, Romania\n\n\u2020 National\n\n1\n\n\fsuch as noble-metal nanostructures exhibit the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) phenomenon when the electromagnetic radiation interacts with the collective oscillations of the conduction electrons. 1 The resonances in visible (VIS) and near-infrarred (NIR) induce extremely\nstrong fields confined to the proximity of the surface of metallic nanoparticles, and therefore creating the opportunity for highly sensitive sensors, 4 surface enhanced Raman scattering (SERS), 5\nsurface enhanced infrared scattering (SEIRS), 6 near-field microscopy, 7 photoluminescence, 8 second or higher harmonic generation, 9,10 and other applications. Closely spaced or nearly touching\n(connected) nanoparticles 11\u201313 as well as clustered particles in different configurations 14 provide\nadditional enhancements of the field within the junction region. Moreover, the \"dumbbell\" shaped\nparticles have also shown other remarkable properties like the large red-shift in the dipolar response, 12,15 and large variations in the spectral response. 9,12\nWe demonstrate the spectral BIE approach by calculating the dielectric response for clusters\nmade of up to four rotationally symmetric particles of two kinds: elongated particles, longer along\nthe rotation axis (aspect ratio greater than unity) and flatten particles, shorter along the rotation axis\n(aspect ratio less than unity). [figure][1][]1 shows the imaginary part of the polarizability for such\nclusters, when the electric field is along the rotation axis. Resonances in the mid-infrared (mid-IR)\nregion of the spectrum appear for both kinds of clusters and are associated with the joints between\nthe particles. These resonances are enhanced as the relative size of the joints become smaller and\nthey. 3 The additional resonance for clusters of more than one flatten particles (sub-figure b) appears\nbecause the cluster as a whole becomes elongated. This resonance is visible for clusters made of\nany number of elongated particles (sub-figure a). There are no new resonances introduced when\nthe number of particles increases. In recent works 9,13,15 the distinct optical behavior of touching\ndimers has been attributed to the joints as soon as the particles come in conductive contact in\nthe dimer. 13 Our results indicate that the resonances due to the joints are located far in mid-IR\nregion of the optical spectrum. On the other hand, in the papers cited above, 9,13,15 the shape of\nparticles used in numerical simulations was close to spherical shape, which is the border shape of\nflatten particles. This observation together with the results of [figure][1][]1 suggests that the red-\n\n2\n\n\fshifted plasmon resonance observed in 9,13,15 for dimers is the additional resonance which appears\nin clusters made of flatten particles.\nThe idea of treating surface plasmons as electrostatic resonances has been introduced in 16 by\nshowing that source-free electromagnetic fields correspond to the eigenvalues of the BIE. 17 Using\na similar approach, we show that a spectral representation of BIE provide the dielectric responses\nof homogeneous nanoparticles and nanoshells in compact forms, which can be directly used in\ndesigning plasmonic structures. The design of analyte sensing is given as an example, where the\nexplicit equations of plasmon resonances are used to calculate the refractive index sensitivity for\neach eigenmode.\n\nFigure 1: Imaginary part of polarizabily for clusters made of elongated (a) and flatten (b) particles\nin longitudinal fields. Mid-IR resonances are associated with the interparticle joints and become\nmore prominent as the joints tighten. Resonances in the visible spectrum are associated with the\nshape and with the number of particles.\n\n3\n\n\fEach eigenmode of the linear response operator has a contribution in the expression of polarizability proportional with its coupling weight and inversely proportional with the depolarization\nfactor. Although this property has been demonstrated for biological cells, 3 it is also valid for metallic nano-particles and nanoshells. If an eigenvalue has a non-zero weight and is close to the value\n1/2, then it is responsible for a mid-infrared (mid-IR) plasmon resonances, which can be used in\noptical nanoantennas. 20,21 As the interparticle junction tightens, the eigenvalue approaches 1/2 and\nthe resonance is enhanced. The coupled-particle LSPR occurs at a frequency red-shifted from that\nof a single-particles. 2\nThe nanoparticle clusters are considered under the electrostatic (quasistatic) approximation, 22\nwhen their size is no more than one tenth of the wavelength of the incoming radiation. The optical behavior of metallic nanoparticles 16,17 as well as the dielectric behavior of living cells 3 can\ntherefore be obtained from a solution of the Laplace equation derived from the corresponding BIE\nwritten for the surface \u03a3 which defines the particle. The polarizability of such an object of permittivity \u03b5i embedded into a medium of permittivity \u03b5o is given in, 3,17 and has the following spectral\nrepresentation\n\n\u03b1 =\u2211\nk\n\npk\n1/(2\u03bb ) \u2212 \u03c7k\n\n(1)\n\nHere electric parameter \u03bb = (\u03b5i \u2212 \u03b5o )/(\u03b5i + \u03b5o ), while \u03c7k and pk are eigenvalues and coupling\nweights corresponding to the k-th eigenmode of the linear response operator M. This geometric\noperator depends only on the shape of the particle, is defined by\n1\nM[\u03bc ] =\n4\u03c0\n\nI\n\nn(x)(x \u2212 y)\nd\u03a3(y)\n3\n\u03a3 |x \u2212 y|\n\n(2)\n\nand have the following properties: 3,16 its spectrum is discrete, real and bounded to the interval [1/2, 1/2]; the value 1/2 is always an eigenvalue, and it has only one active eigenvalue for spherical\nparticles. The imaginary part of the polarizability \u03b1 is directly related to optical absorption of\nmetallic nanoparticles, 22 and depends on the polarization of the incident radiation 3,17 through\ndipole-coupling weights pk . Equation 1 shows how material properties, all collected within \u03bb , are\n4\n\n\fseparated from geometric properties contained in \u03c7k and pk .\nAn object covered by a very thin shell of permittivity \u03b5S has a polarizability calculated from ??\nby replacing \u03bb by \u03bbk = (\u03b5\u0303k \u2212 \u03b5o )/(\u03b5\u0303k + \u03b5o ), 3 where the effective mode-dependent permittivity \u03b5\u0303k\nis given by:\n\n\u03b5\u0303k = \u03b5S\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03b5i \u2212 \u03b5S\n1+\n\u03b5S + \u03b4 (1/2 \u2212 \u03c7k )\u03b5i + \u03b4 (1/2 + \u03c7k )\u03b5S\n\n\u0013\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03b4 is a small parameter roughly equal to the relative volume of the shell with respect to the\nparticle. 3 This equation allows a direct connection to the hybridization model 18\nWithin various ranges of frequencies, the dielectric functions have in general the form \u03b5 = A +\nB/W , where A and B are nearly constant functions of angular frequency \u03c9 , while W is a fast varying\nfunction of \u03c9 . In the radiofrequency domain \u03b5 = \u03b5 \u2212 i\u03c3 /(\u03b5vac \u03c9 ) with \u03b5 the static permittivity,\n\n\u03b5vac the vacuum permittivity and \u03c3 the DC conductivity. In the optical regime dielectrics can\nbe successfully described by a nearly constant dielectric function \u03b5 = \u03b5d and metals by a Drude\ndielectric function \u03b5 = \u03b5m \u2212 \u03c9 p2 /\u03c9 /(\u03c9 + i\u03b3 ), where \u03b5m is the interband contribution, \u03c9P is the\nelectron plasma frequency and \u03b3 is the damping constant.\nThe frequency-dependent polarizability of a homogeneous metal nanoparticle of arbitrary shape\ncan then be written as a sum of Drude-Lorentz terms by using expansion ??:\n\n\u03b1 plasmon (\u03c9 ) = \u2211\nk\n\npk (\u03b5m \u2212 \u03b5do )\n\u2212\n\u03b5eff\n\n(4)\n\n2\n\u03c9\u0303 pk\n\u03b5do\npk\n\u2212\n2\n1/2 \u2212 \u03c7k \u03b5eff \u03c9 (\u03c9 + i\u03b3 ) \u2212 \u03c9\u0303 pk\n\nwhere \u03b5do is the permittivity of the outer dielectric medium and the effective dielectric parameter is\n\n\u03b5eff = (1/2 + \u03c7k )\u03b5do + (1/2 \u2212 \u03c7k )\u03b5m . For very small particles/clusters dissipation can be neglected\n(\u03b3 \u226a \u03c9 p ) and \u03c9\u0303 pk is the frequency of the localized plasmon resonance, which depends explicitly\n2 = (1/2 \u2212 \u03c7 )\u03c9 2 /\u03b5 eff.\non the dielectric and geometric parameters of the particle: \u03c9\u0303 pk\nk\np\n\nEach active mode in ?? has a fast-varying (Drude-Lorentz term) factor proportional to its coupling weight pk and inversely proportional to (1/2 \u2212 \u03c7k ), the depolarization factor. In clustered\n\n5\n\n\fparticles with tight junctions, several eigenvalues get closer to 1/2 and the factor pk /(1/2 \u2212 \u03c7k )\nhas an important contribution even though the couplings pk are vanishingly small. The local field\nenhancement factor (the height of the resonance peak) is pk /(1/2 \u2212 \u03c7k )(\u03b5do /\u03b5eff )(\u03c9\u0303 pk /\u03b3 ) as in the\nharmonic oscillator model. 22 As \u03c7k approaches 1/2 for tighter and tighter junctions the plasmon\nresonance red-shifts toward lower frequencies.\nThe polarizability of dielectric particles of permittivity \u03b5di covered by a thin metallic layer and\nembedded into a dielectric medium of permittivity \u03b5do is obtained in the first order in \u03b4 , from ??\nand ?? as\n\n\u03b1shell \u2248 \u2211\nk\n\n\u03b5do\npk\n\u2212\n1/2 \u2212 \u03c7k \u03b5eff\n\npk (\u03b5di \u2212 \u03b5do )\n\u2212\n\u03b5eff\n\u20322\n\u03c9\u0303 pk\n\u20322\n\u03c9 (\u03c9 + i\u03b3 ) \u2212 \u03c9\u0303 pk\n\n\u2032\u20322\n\u03c9\u0303 pk\n\u2032\u20322 \u2212 \u03c9 2 /\u03b5\n\u03c9 (\u03c9 + i\u03b3 ) \u2212 \u03c9\u0303 pk\np m\n\n(5)\n\n+\n\n!\n\n\u20322 = (\u03b4 (1/2 + \u03c7 )(1/2 \u2212 \u03c7 )\u03c9 2 )/\u03b5 , \u03c9\u0303 \u2032\u20322 = (\u03b5 /\u03b5 )(\u03b4 (1/2 \u2212 \u03c7 )2 \u03c9 2 )/\u03b5\nwith \u03c9\u0303 pk\nk\nk\ndi m\nk\np\np\neff pk\neff and \u03b5eff =\n\n(1/2 + \u03c7k )\u03b5do + (1/2 \u2212 \u03c7k )\u03b5di . Like the hybridization model, 18 ?? exhibits two plasmon resonances. One resonance frequency for a shelled particle is red-shifted with respect to the one of the\np\nhomogenous particle by a factor of \u03b4 (1/2 + \u03c7k ). The value of the peak of the resonance is also\np\nreduced by the factor \u03b4 (1/2 + \u03c7k ). Results obtained in 19 can be derived from ??, by observing\n\nthat \u03b5eff determines the influence of \u03b5di and \u03b5do on the plasmon resonance in nanoshells. The other\nq\n\u2032\u20322 + \u03c9 2 /\u03b5 is blue-shifted with respect to \u03c9\u0303 \u2032 and \u03c9\nresonance, located at \u03c9\u0303 pk\npk and is smaller\np m\npk\n\nthan both the red-shifted resonance and the resonance of a similar homogeneous particle.\n\nA straightforward application of ?? and ?? is in the design of analyte sensing. Large changes\nin the position of the plasmon resonance in response to small changes in the refractive index of\nthe outer medium are desired. The refractive index ndo sensitivity for the wavelength \u03bb pk of each\ndipole active eigenmode is d \u03bb pk /dndo = (1/2 + \u03c7k )ndo \u03bb pk /\u03b5eff which increases with increasing\nwavelenght and \u03c7k . A body of theoretical and experimental research 2 has suggested that either\nelongated particles or thin nanoshells have high refractive index sensitivity. A direct explanation\n6\n\n\fof this derives directly from ?? and ?? which show the red shift of the plasmon resonance for\ntightly joined clusters, elongated particles and nanoshells. 2,23 A figure of merit is given by the\nratio of refractive index sensitivity over the width of the plasmon resonance. In the limit \u03b3 \u226a \u03c9 p ,\nthe resonance width is given by the damping constant \u03b3 . In the case of nanoparticles \u03b3 is given\nby the the damping constant of the bulk and an additional term due to the surface scattering of\nconduction electrons: \u03b3 = vF (1/l + 1/L), 22 with vF the Fermi velocity (about 1.4 \u00d7 106 m/s for\nboth Ag and Au), l the bulk room temperature mean free path (about 52 nm for Ag and 40 nm for\nAu), and L is the effective mean free path for collision with the particle's boundary. For a spherical\nparticle of diameter d, L = 2d/3, such that if d = 25 \u223c 30 nm, \u03b3 is about 0.1 eV. The damping\nconstants in nanoshells are even greater due to larger effective mean free paths for collision; 24\ntherefore nanorods are better than nanoshells when used in analyte sensing. Using ?? and ?? the\nrefractive index sensitivity of nanoparticles can be directly calculated as a function of the aspect\nratio or as a function of composition of the nanoparticle clusters.\nWe have analyzed clusters of nanoparticles as n touching objects with a rotational surface\ngenerated by the equation: x = g(z) cos \u03c6 , y = g(z) sin \u03c6 and \u2212Ln \u2264 z \u2264 Ln (the insets of Figure 1a\nand 1b) with\n\ng(n, h, A, a, b, z) = A (1 + sign (z sign(z) \u2212 (n \u2212 1)a)) \u00d7\n\u0013\u0015\n\u0014\n\u0012\n1 \u2212 ((z \u2212 sign(z)(n \u2212 1)a)/a)2\nsign(z) z + a\n\u00d7\n1 \u2212 floor\nna\n1 + (1 + b(z \u2212 sign(z)(n \u2212 1)a)2\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\n1\nh + 2(A \u2212 h) 1 \u2212\n1 + (1 \u2212 H(z))2\n\nq\n\nwhere H(z) = mod((\u22121)floor(z/a)+n\u22121 z, a)2, sign(z) is signum function, -1, 0 or 1 if z is negative,\nzero or positive, floor(z) is the greatest integer less than z, and mod(x, y) is the remainder of the\ndivision of x by y. Parameters A, a, b determine the shape of an individual particle, for example,\nthe ratio A/a is the aspect ratio, and h determines the size of the connecting gap, and Ln = na.\n[figure][1][]1 shows the resonances in the mid-IR introduced by tight junctions because some\neigenmodes have eigenvalues near 1/2 and non-zero, but very small, weights. In a recent paper we\n7\n\n\fFigure 2: Imaginary part of polarizabily for clusters of elongated (a) (A = 2, a = 3, h = 0.2,\nb = 0.1) and flatten (b) (A = 3, a = 2, h = 0.05, b = 0.1) particles in visible spectrum.\n\n8\n\n\fhave shown that in a cluster of n connected particles there are n \u2212 1 eigenvalues close to 1/2 (the\nsmaller the junction the closer the eigenvalues). 3 However, only the eigenmodes with antisymmetric combination of charge distribution in the lobes are active and contribute to polarizability.\nThus the eigenmodes close to 1/2 induce mid-IR plasmon resonances in optical spectra of metallic clusters even though the weight (dipole coupling) is quite small. In our examples clusters of\ntwo and three particles have just one resonance, while for clusters of four particles there are two\noverlapping resonances. As a rule, all resonances move toward infrared with increasing number of\nparticles in the clusters, as seen in [figure][2][]2.\n\nFigure 3: Imaginary part of polarizabily for clusters of elongated (a) and flatten (b) particles placed\nin electric perpendicular to the rotation axis.\nIn contrast to parallel fields ([figure][1][]1 and [figure][2][]2), the polarizability for clusters in\nfield perpendicular to their axes, displays no new significant resonances, as seen in [figure][3][]3.\n\n9\n\n\fThe existing resonances move toward ultraviolet as n increases. Also, the mid-IR resonance shifts\ntoward larger wavelengths as the ratio h/A decreases.\n[figure][2][]2 and [figure][3][]3 indicate that, in clusters as well as in individual nanoparticles,\nthe amplitude of plasmon resonance depends also on the direction of polarization. Thus flatten\nparticles have the greatest plasmon resonances for transverse polarization, while elongated particles has theirs for longitudinal fields. The explanation is based on the harmonic oscillator model,\nwhich relates the amplitude of plasmon resonance to the polarizability of the particles. 22\nTo conclude this letter, the spectral BIE is a rational approach which provides useful insights\nof the plasmonic behavior of metal nanoparticles. Linear clusters of overlapping nanoparticles\nare good candidates for optical sub-wavelength guides. 4,13 Our results suggest that the collective\nresonances originating from single-particle resonances can be easily activated by exciting just one\nparticle at one end of the cluster. In contrast, the collective resonances that are not present in an\nindividual particle can be successfully activated by exciting the last two particles at the end of the\ncluster. Another possible application of linear clusters of overlapping nanoparticles is their use as\noptical nano-antennas instead of nanorods. 20,21 The utilization of linear clusters as optical nanoantennas has a lot of promise due to recent advances in the manufacturing of highly uniform dimer\narrays with gaps smaller than 10 nm. 25 Thus instead of using long and narrow nanorods, one can\nuse linear clusters, with lengths comparable to the length of the nanorods and junctions comparable\nto the cross section of the nanorods. 3\n\nAcknowledgement\nThis work has been supported by the Romanian Project \"Ideas\" No.120/2007 and FP 7 Nanomagma\nNo.214107/2008.\n\nReferences\n(1) E.
