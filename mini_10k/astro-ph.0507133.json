From the\nfundamental physics standpoint, these events are expected to provide the best available\nmapping of the spacetime around a rotating black hole (Ryan 1995, 1997; Hughes 2003).\n1\n\nDepartment of Astronomy, University of Maryland at College Park, College Park, MD 20742-2421;\nmiller@astro.umd.edu, hamilton@astro.umd.edu, vanessa@astro.umd.edu\n2\n\nDepartment of Physics and Astronomy, Northwestern University, Evanston, IL 60208;\nm-freitag@northwestern.edu\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\nAstrophysically, they may well reveal the numbers of supermassive black holes in a mass\nrange (\u223c 105 \u2212 107 M\u2299 ) that is difficult to probe otherwise (e.g., Greene & Ho 2004).\nCurrent studies of EMRI rates and properties (Hils & Bender 1995; Sigurdsson & Rees\n1997; Miralda-Escud\u00e9 & Gould 2000; Freitag 2001, 2003; Ivanov 2002; Hopman & Alexander\n2005) have focused exclusively on capture of compact objects by emission of gravitational\nradiation during a close pass. That is, a compact object (for example, a 10 M\u2299 black hole)\npasses close to the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) and emits gravitational waves\nthat shrink its orbit significantly. The black hole then continues to orbit, and if its motion\nis not perturbed significantly by interactions with other stars then it eventually spirals into\nthe SMBH. When the orbit becomes detectable with LISA, it has a significant eccentricity\nof typically e \u223c 0.5 \u2212 0.9 (Freitag 2003; Hopman & Alexander 2005; but see Ivanov 2002).\nHere we consider a different process, in which a stellar-mass binary containing a compact\nobject comes close enough to the SMBH that the binary is tidally separated, leaving one\nobject bound to the SMBH and the other almost always ejected to infinity at high speed.\nTidal separation was discussed recently by Pfahl (2005) as a way to fuel intermediate-mass\nblack holes, and has been considered as a method to produce high-velocity stars (Hills 1988,\n1991; Yu & Tremaine 2003; Brown et al. 2005) and as a possible way to deposit high-mass\nstars close to Sgr A\u2217 (Gould & Quillen 2003). It was also listed by Hils & Bender (1995)\nand Freitag & Benz (2002) as a mechanism to be examined in the EMRI context, but to our\nknowledge has not yet been explored quantitatively.\nThe key point about this process is that, unlike in the two-body capture scenario, no\nenergy needs to be dissipated in order to have a capture. As a result, capture can occur\nat much larger radii than is possible in the two-body case: for example, a binary with\na semimajor axis of tenths of an AU can be captured at pericenter distances of tens of\nAU relative to the SMBH, compared with the \u223c 0.1 AU that is required for two-body\ncapture. In addition, the semimajor axis of the resulting bound object will be modest,\nperhaps tens of times the pericenter distance (Hills 1991; Pfahl 2005). EMRIs formed in\nthis way are therefore relatively immune to perturbations of their orbits that could cause\nthem to plunge directly into the SMBH (which lowers rates significantly for EMRIs formed\nby two-body capture; see Hils & Bender 1995; Hopman & Alexander 2005). Combined\nwith the higher cross section, this suggests that the overall rate of EMRIs could have an\nimportant contribution from tidal separation of binaries, even if only a few percent of compact\nobjects are in binaries. In addition, the high pericenter after capture implies that when tidal\nseparation EMRIs are detectable with LISA they will have eccentricities close to zero (there\nmight also be independent paths to low eccentricity, such as production of black holes in an\naccretion disk and their subsequent advection to the SMBH; see Levin 2003).\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nIn \u00a7 2 we discuss this process in more quantitative detail. In \u00a7 3 we list some of the\nquestions that will have to be answered to get more specific predictions of relative rates, and\nto interpret LISA observations when they arrive.\n\n2.\n\nTidal Separation and EMRIs\n2.1.\n\nCapture processes\n\nTo evaluate the tidal separation scenario, let us first recall the process of two-body\ncapture. Suppose that a point mass m orbits a SMBH of mass M \u226b m with an orbital speed\nv\u221e at apocenter (assumed to be at a large distance). Its orbit will be modified significantly\n1\n2\nif, during its motion, it releases >\n\u223c 2 mv\u221e of energy in gravitational radiation. From Quinlan\n& Shapiro (1989), this condition implies a pericenter distance\nrp < rp,GW \u2248 0.13 AU(m/10 M\u2299 )2/7 (M/106 M\u2299 )5/7 (v\u221e /60 km s\u22121 )\u22124/7 .\n\n(1)\n\nWe have scaled by 60 km s\u22121 because this is roughly the velocity dispersion inferred for a\ngalaxy with a central black hole mass of 106 M\u2299 (Merritt & Ferrarese 2001; Tremaine et al.\n2002; Barth et al. 2005). The time required to spiral into the SMBH would then be much\nless than a Hubble time, except that other stars perturb the orbit significantly (see \u00a7 2.2).\nThe gravitational radius is rg \u2261 GM/c2 \u2248 0.01 AU(M/106 M\u2299 ). Therefore,\nrp,GW /rg \u2248 13(m/10 M\u2299 )2/7 (M/106 M\u2299 )\u22122/7 (v\u221e /60 km s\u22121 )\u22124/7 .\n\n(2)\n\nFor comparison, the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit around a nonrotating SMBH\nis 6rg . As another comparison, detection of an EMRI with LISA will be very difficult if the\ngravitational wave frequency is less than fGW \u223c 2\u22123 mHz, because at lower frequencies there\nis strong unresolvable foreground noise due to double white dwarf binaries in our Galaxy\n(Bender & Hils 1997; Nelemans et al. 2001; Farmer & Phinney 2003). For a circular orbit, the\ngravitational wave frequency is double the orbital frequency (Peters & Mathews 1963). At\n2 mHz, then, the radius of a circular orbit is r(2 mHz) \u2248 10 rg (M/106 M\u2299 )\u22122/3 . Therefore,\na stellar-mass compact object needs to go very deep into the potential well of an SMBH to\nbe captured or to be observed with LISA. As a consequence, although the orbit circularizes\ndue to emission of gravitational radiation (Peters 1964), the eccentricity in the LISA band\nis still e \u223c 0.5 \u2212 0.9.\nNow consider tidal separation. Suppose that a binary with a total mass m and semimajor\naxis a moves towards a supermassive black hole of mass M. If the orbit has a pericenter\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\ndistance less than\nrtide \u2248 (3M/m)1/3 a\n\u2248 7 AU(M/106 M\u2299 )1/3 (m/10 M\u2299 )\u22121/3 (a/0.1 AU) ,\n\n(3)\n\nthen the binary will be separated by the tidal field of the SMBH. Note that the numerical\nfactor in the cube root is correct for a prograde binary on a circular orbit around the SMBH;\nit changes to four for weakly hyperbolic prograde orbits and roughly half this for retrograde\norbits (Hamilton & Burns 1991, 1992). We scale a by 0.1 AU because such a binary is\ntight enough to survive three-body encounters but wide enough to avoid rapid merger by\ngravitational radiation (see \u00a7 3 for further discussion).\nFor an initially hard circular binary with component masses 10 M\u2299 and 10 M\u2299 in a\nhyperbolic pass by a 106 M\u2299 SMBH, our numerical simulations suggest that the typical\neccentricity is e \u223c 0.98 after capture, consistent with the results of Hills (1991) and Pfahl\n(2005), who focused on tidal separation of main sequence binaries. For an initial binary\nseparation of a = 0.1 AU, the typical pericenter distance after capture is a few AU, and the\ntypical apocenter distance is a few hundred AU; both are proportional to the semimajor axis\nof the original binary. We also simulated tidal separation of initially hard circular binaries\nwith component masses 10 M\u2299 and 1 M\u2299 around a 106 M\u2299 SMBH, representing for example\na binary with a black hole and a white dwarf or a black hole and a neutron star. We find\nthat only a small fraction of encounters lead to ejection of both objects or survival of the\nbinary, the rest resulting in capture of one object and ejection of the other. In \u223c 40% of the\ncaptures, the 10 M\u2299 object becomes bound to the SMBH, with an apocenter distance that\nis a factor of a few larger than for the 10 M\u2299 \u2212 10 M\u2299 simulations (as is expected given the\nsmaller energy transfer from the 1 M\u2299 object; see Pfahl 2005 for an analytic discussion). In\nthe remaining \u223c 60% of the captures the 1 M\u2299 compact object is captured, which also leads\nto an extreme mass ratio inspiral, but a weaker one than the 10 M\u2299 \u2212 106 M\u2299 coalescence\nwould produce.\nBecause the pericenter distance from binary capture is \u226b rg , the orbit circularizes\ndramatically by emission of gravitational radiation and typically has e < 0.01 in the LISA\nsensitivity band, in sharp contrast to EMRIs produced by capture of singles.\n\n2.2.\n\nEffects of nuclear stellar dynamics\n\nThe motion of a binary must be close to radial to be captured. For example, a binary\nwith semimajor axis a \u223c 1 AU could be captured if it passed within \u223c 100 AU of the\nSMBH, but this is tiny compared to the distance of a few parsecs from the SMBH where\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nmost binaries presumably lie. It is therefore important to map out some of the dynamical\nprocesses that will affect the injection into these orbits. These are discussed in detail by\nmany authors (e.g., Frank & Rees 1976; Lightman & Shapiro 1977; Magorrian & Tremaine\n1999; Syer & Ulmer 1999), so here we simply quote the results.\nA supermassive black hole of mass M will dominate the dynamics out to the \"radius of\ninfluence\"\nrinfl = GM/\u03c302 \u2248 1 pc(M/106 M\u2299 )(60 km s\u22121 /\u03c30 )2 ,\n(4)\nwhere \u03c30 is the velocity dispersion of stars far outside this radius. At radii r > rinfl , a\nconstant velocity dispersion implies a stellar mass density \u03c1 \u223c r \u22122 , whereas at r < rinfl the\ndensity can take a different slope \u03c1 \u223c r \u2212\u03b3 , for example \u03b3 = 3/2 or \u03b3 = 7/4 (e.g., Bahcall &\nWolf 1976; Young 1980).\nFor r < rinfl the orbital time is torb = 2\u03c0(r 3/GM)1/2 , whereas for r > rinfl , torb =\n2\u03c0(r/rinfl)(GM/\u03c303 ). The relaxation time is the time required for the velocity of a star\nto change by of order itself (in magnitude or direction), by deflections due to two-body\nencounters. The local relaxation time for a compact object of mass mCO interacting with\nstars of average mass hmi is (Spitzer 1987)\ntrlx (r) =\n\n0.339\n\u03c3 3 (r)\n.\nln \u039b G2 hmimCO n(r)\n\n(5)\n\nHere \u03c3(r) is the local velocity dispersion (equal to the orbital speed when r < rinfl ), n(r) is\nthe local number density, and ln \u039b \u223c 10 is the Coulomb logarithm. Inside rinfl the relaxation\ntime is roughly constant.\nFor a bound object on a very eccentric orbit, e \u2248 1, the angular momentum is much less\nthan the angular momentum of a circular orbit with the same semimajor axis. Therefore,\nthe angular momentum only needs to change slightly to make an order unity difference in\nthe orbit. This timescale is tJ (r, e) \u2248 (1 \u2212 e)trlx (r) (e.g., Hopman & Alexander 2005).\nFor a given position R and speed V , the loss cone is defined as the set of directions\nof the velocity V~ leading to such small pericenter distances that the object of interest is\nremoved from the system. In the full loss cone regime, for which tJ < torb (where tJ is\nevaluated for the angular momentum corresponding to the loss cone), objects that enter the\nloss cone and are removed are immediately replaced, within an orbital time, by objects that\nare deflected in from other orbits. In this regime, an object that starts down the loss cone\nis likely to be deflected out of the cone during the orbit. In the empty loss cone regime, for\nwhich tJ > torb , replacement of objects through the loss cone has to occur over a relaxation\ntime. If the number of objects per radius (assuming spherical symmetry) is dN/dr and the\nangle subtended by the loss cone at radius r is \u03b8LC (r), then the approximate capture rates\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nin the full and empty loss cone regimes are (see Syer & Ulmer 1999)\n2\nd\u1e44full /dr \u223c \u03b8LC\n(r)(dN/dr)/torb\n2\nd\u1e44empty /dr \u223c (dN/dr)/ [ln(1/\u03b8LC\n(r))trlx(r)] .\n\n(6)\n\nFar from the SMBH the loss cone is full, whereas close it is empty. For the binaries, the\nfull/empty transition radius (which defines the \"critical radius\") is comparable to the radius\nof influence, whereas for the singles the transition occurs at \u223c 10% of the radius of influence.\nThe merger rate is dominated by the region near the critical radius (see, e.g., Frank & Rees\n1976). The smaller critical radius for singles partially compensates for the much larger cross\nsection of the binaries, and for \u03b3 = 3/2 the net merger rate enhancement turns out to be\nroughly a factor of ten in favor of the binaries.\nAs pointed out by Hils & Bender (1995) and analyzed by Hopman & Alexander (2005),\nthere is an additional major effect. A single compact object captured by gravitational radiation emission typically has a very large apocenter distance, often on the order of tenths\nof a parsec or more. As a result, even after it has first been captured, it has a chance to be\nperturbed in the next orbit. Sometimes, a perturbation will cause the orbit to be so close\nto radial that the object plunges straight into the SMBH. Although this does not affect the\nmerger rate, such objects do not contribute to the LISA event rate, because they plunge\nbefore their orbital period has become shorter than \u2248 103\u22124 s. Hopman & Alexander (2005)\nestimate that \u223c80-90% of the potential EMRI events are lost in this fashion. This effect\namounts to reducing significantly the volume from which LISA-detectable EMRIs can originate, which therefore decreases the observed rate. Note, however, that mass segregation\nof black holes into a dense subcluster may reduce the impact of this effect (E. S. Phinney,\npersonal communication).\nIn contrast, inspirals produced by separation of binaries are not susceptible to this effect.\nThe reason is that, as discussed in \u00a7 2.1, the apocenter distance is usually only tens of times\nthe pericenter distance, hence tJ \u226b torb . As a result, we expect that any perturbations will\nbe gradual, hence a decrease in the pericenter distance will produce greater gravitational\nradiation emission and thus circularization rather than a plunge.\nProcesses that enhance angular momentum diffusion, such as resonant relaxation (Rauch\n& Tremaine 1996) and interactions in triaxial potentials (Holley-Bockelmann et al. 2002;\nPoon & Merritt 2002; Merritt & Poon 2004) will tend to push the full loss cone regime to\nsmaller radii, which will enhance rates moderately for both binaries and singles. However,\nassessment of the net effects will require detailed calculations (compare Rauch & Ingalls\n(1998), who show that the total rate of stellar tidal disruptions is at most doubled by\nresonant relaxation, because the rate bottleneck is elsewhere).\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\n3.\n\nDiscussion and Conclusions\n\nIn this paper we have focused on interactions that leave a \u223c 10 M\u2299 black hole in orbit\naround a 106 M\u2299 SMBH. We note that the same process will also enhance rates for neutron\nstars and white dwarfs around 106 M\u2299 black holes, likely by an even larger factor, because\nwe see from Eq. (2) that direct capture of lower-mass objects at a given speed requires an\neven closer passage to the SMBH. There may also be a moderate effect for intermediate-mass\nblack holes (IMBHs) of \u223c 103 M\u2299 in dense stellar clusters (see Miller & Colbert 2004 for an\noverview of the evidence for IMBHs and their association with clusters), as discussed by Pfahl\n(2005). This could lead to detection with LISA of BH-IMBH orbits (see Baumgardt et al.\n2004 for discussion of gravitational radiation from direct capture onto IMBHs in clusters) or\norbits of disrupted stars around IMBHs (Hopman & Portegies Zwart 2005), although only\nthe nearest sources are likely to be seen (Will 2004). In addition, the loss cone formalism\n3\nis unlikely to be directly relevant here because for M <\n\u223c 10 M\u2299 the wandering radius of the\nblack hole is comparable to or larger than its radius of influence (see Merritt 2001) and hence\nthe interactions need to be treated as independent binary-single encounters (see G\u00fcltekin,\nMiller, & Hamilton 2004 for a recent application to intermediate-mass black holes).\nIt is not trivial to estimate the absolute rate of EMRI captures by the mechanism we\ndescribe, because of the number of processes involved. For example, the fraction of black\nholes in binaries is especially important (see Muno et al. 2005 for a recent discussion in\nthe context of the Galactic center). This fraction depends on (1) the fraction of binaries\nthat survive stellar evolution (Belczynski et al. 2004), (2) the fraction of those binaries that\nsurvive interactions in the dense stellar environment of the galactic nucleus (Ivanova et al.\n2005), and (3) the fraction of initially solitary black holes that acquire companions by threebody interactions before they are captured by the SMBH. An important output from the\ncombination of these processes is (4) the distribution of semimajor axes of binaries containing\nblack holes, because very tight binaries (a <\n\u223c 0.05 AU for a 10 M\u2299 \u2212 10 M\u2299 binary) could\nmerge by gravitational radiation before being separated by the SMBH, and black holes in\nvery wide binaries (more than a few AU) could end up after separation with semimajor axes\nso large (more than \u223c 0.1 pc) that perturbations during a single dynamical time drop them\ninto plunge orbits, making them undetectable with LISA (Hopman & Alexander 2005).\nMass segregation will tend to move black hole binaries to regions of higher density and\nhigher velocity dispersion, where three-body interactions are important, hence we must also\ncompute (5) the evolution of the semimajor axis and companion mass as a function of time,\nversus the probability of capture by the SMBH as a function of time, to estimate the true\ndistribution of semimajor axes after capture, and hence the subsequent evolution of the\norbit under the influence of relaxation and gravitational radiation. All of these processes\nwill require careful computation in future work.\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nWithout knowing the absolute rate, we can parameterize the ratio of the rate of captures\ndue to binary separation to the captures due to singles as\n\u1e44binary\nfb Rbinary hfbinary,LISA i\n,\n=\nfs Rsingle hfsingle,LISA i\n\u1e44single\n\n(7)\n\nwhere fb is the fraction of compact objects that are in binaries that are neither too tight\nnor too wide (see above); fs is the fraction that are single; Rbinary is the total rate of tidal\nseparations per binary; Rsingle is the total rate of gravitational radiation captures per single;\nhfbinary,LISA i is the overall fraction of binary sources captured in orbits tight enough to spiral\ninto the LISA band within a Hubble time; and hfsingle,LISA i is the overall fraction of captured\nsingles that end up detectable with LISA (rather than being perturbed into plunge orbits).\nOur current best guesses are Rbinary /Rsingle \u223c 10 and hfbinary,LISA i/hfsingle,LISA i \u223c 1 \u2212 10.\nTherefore, if the steady-state binary fraction (reduced by merging at small semimajor axes,\nand by ionizations at large semimajor axes) is fb > 0.01 \u2212 0.1, EMRIs from binaries could\ndominate the total rates.\n\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank the Aspen Center for Physics for hospitality and hiking during the production of this paper, and thank Matt Benacquista, Sam Finn, Vicky Kalogera, and Alberto\nVecchio for organizing the LISA workshop.
