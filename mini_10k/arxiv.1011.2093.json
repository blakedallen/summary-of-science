INTRODUCTION\nFor over a decade Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) have\nwidely been used as a cosmological distance indicator to\ndirectly probe the accelerating expansion of the universe\n(Riess et al. 1996; Perlmutter et al. 1997, 1999; Astier\net al. 2006) and measure the Hubble constant H0 (Jha\net al. 1999). In addition, supernovae (SNe) are critical\nin the study of star formation history and the chemical\nevolution of the universe (Sharon et al. 2007). SNe Ia\nare believed to be the result of a deflagration of a white\ndwarf that accretes matter from a companion or merges\nwith another white dwarf (Whelan & Iben 1973; Iben &\nTutukov 1984; Webbink 1984). Yet, the stellar evolution\nleading to SNe Ia is not clearly understood.\nRecent studies have focused on the correlation between\nthe SNe Ia and their host galaxies, trying to understand\nSNe Ia through the analyses of properties of their host\ngalaxies. The characteristics, such as the morphology,\ncolor, star formation rate, metallicity, and stellar age,\nof host galaxies provide clues to the understanding of\nthe progenitors (Gallagher et al. 2005; Mannucci et al.\n2005; Sullivan et al. 2006; Calura & Matteucci 2006).\nGallagher et al. (2005) studied the effect of the environment on the properties of SNe Ia by analyzing SN\nIa host galaxies to investigate systematic effects in the\ncalibration of SNe Ia. Mannucci et al. (2005) studied\nthe dependency of the SN Ia rate per unit stellar mass\non the morphology and the color of the host galaxies.\nThey found that the SN Ia rate is higher in late-type\nthan in early-type galaxies and larger in bluer galaxies\n1 Department of Astronomy and Atmospheric Sciences,\nKyungpook National University Daegu 702-701, Korea;\nduegdo13@gmail.com, mgp@knu.ac.kr\n2 Korea\nInstitute for Advanced Study, Hoegiro 87,\nDongdaemun-Gu, Seoul 130-722, Korea; cbp@kias.re.kr\n3 Department of Astronomy & Space Science, Kyung Hee\nUniversity, Kyungki 446-701, Korea; yychoi@kias.re.kr\n4 Corresponding author\n\nthan in redder galaxies. Sullivan et al. (2006) showed\nthat the SN Ia rate per unit mass is proportional to the\nstar formation rate of the host galaxies. Calura & Matteucci (2006) studied SNe rate as a function of the Hubble galaxy type using four different chemical evolution\nmodels and found an increasing trend of the SN Ia rate\ntoward the later Hubble type. The SN rate itself would\nprovide information on the formation and the evolution\nof the galaxies.\nThe study of SNe in galaxy cluster is also important in\nunderstanding the metallicity evolution and star formation history of the intracluster medium (Mannucci et al.\n2008). Research on the cluster SN rate progresses vigorously as the detection of SNe in galaxy cluster increases\n(Gal-Yam et al. 2003; Sharon et al. 2007). The SN Ia\nrate in early-type cluster galaxies is found to be higher\nthan that in early-type field galaxies (Mannucci et al.\n2008). Carlberg et al. (2008) measured the clustering of\nthe SN host galaxies relative to the field galaxies using\nthe angular cross-correlation function of the Supernova\nLegacy Survey sample. They found that the SN host\ngalaxies are more correlated with galaxy clusters than\nthe field galaxies.\nHowever, most studies so far are not free from small\nnumber statistics and sample biases. Recently, the Sloan\nDigital Sky Survey (SDSS) have been completed, and\nvast amounts of data on galaxies and SNe have been\nreleased, which enabled statistically meaningful studies\non the galaxy properties and the environmental effects on\nthe galaxy properties with the SDSS galaxy data (Goto\net al. 2003; Balogh et al. 2004; Tanaka et al. 2004;\nBlanton et al. 2005; Weinmann et al. 2006; Choi et\nal. 2007; Park et al. 2007, 2008; Park & Choi 2009).\nThe vast amount of the SDSS data makes it possible to\nconstruct fair samples for these studies and to minimize\nthe selection effects. The SN host galaxies in the SDSS\nlocate in the region called \"redshift desert\" between the\n\n\f2\n\nHAN ET AL.\n\nlow and high redshift regions, while those used in many\nof the previous studies locate in the low and high redshift\nregions.\nThe purpose of this study is to understand the nature\nof the progenitors through the comparison of the SN Ia\nhost galaxies and the Main galaxies from the SDSS, in\nterms of galaxy properties (e.g., morphology, luminosity,\nand color) and environmental effects. In this paper we\nstudy the dependence of the SN Ia rate on environments\nattributed to the host galaxy, to the nearest neighbor\ngalaxy, and to the nearest cluster of galaxies (Park &\nChoi 2009; Park & Hwang 2009). The Main galaxies\nof the SDSS located in the same environment are used\nas a comparison sample. The systematic dependence of\nthe SN Ia rate on host galaxy properties or on the effects of the nearest neighbor galaxy or cluster will let us\nunderstand the nature of the SN Ia progenitors and its\npotential redshift dependence. In Section 2, we describe\nthe SN Ia data from the SDSS-II SN survey, the Main\ngalaxies, the Abell cluster and identify SN Ia host galaxies. The analyses and results on the properties and the\nenvironments are presented in Section 3. We summarize\nin Section 4. Throughout this paper we assume a flat\nuniverse with density parameters \u03a9m = 0.27, \u03a9\u039b = 0.73,\nand Hubble constant H0 = 100h km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 .\n\n2. DATA\n\n2.1. The Sloan Digital Sky Survey\nThe SDSS is a large-scale photometric and spectroscopic survey of Northern Galactic hemisphere using a\ndedicated 2.5 m, f/5 survey telescope with a wide field of\nview (3\u25e6 ) at the Apache Point Observatory, New Mexico\n(York et al. 2000; Gunn et al. 2006). The photometric\nsurvey uses a specially designed multi-band CCD camera that covers five bands over a wide wavelength range\ndenoted by u, g, r, i, and z with effective wavelengths of\n3550\u00c5, 4770 \u00c5, 6230\u00c5, 7620\u00c5, and 9130\u00c5, respectively\n(Fukugita et al. 1996; Gunn et al. 1998). The observed objects are processed by an automated photometric pipeline and are astrometrically calibrated (Lupton et\nal. 2001). The objects of SDSS spectroscopic observations such as galaxies, quasars, luminous red galaxies,\nand so on are selected by a spectroscopic selection algorithm (Richards et al. 2002; Eisenstein et al. 2001). The\nfirst and second phases of the SDSS (SDSS\u2212I and II)\nhave been completed and produced seven data releases\n(see Abazajian et al. 2009 for Data Release 7) so far.\nThe SDSS-II Supernova Survey is a part of the SDSS-II\nproject that scans a designated region called the Stripe\n82, centered on the celestial equator in the Southern\nGalactic hemisphere, \u221260\u25e6 < R.A. < 60\u25e6 and \u22121\u25e6. 25 <\n\u03b4 < 1\u25e6. 25, covering an area of 300 deg2 (Frieman et al.\n2008; Zheng et al. 2008; Sako et al. 2008; Dilday et al.\n2008). The SDSS-II SN Survey aims to discover highquality light curves for SNe Ia at 0.05 . z . 0.35 and has\nseveral advantages such as covering a larger spatial volume than other SN surveys by using wide-field CCD camera and drift scanning. The SDSS-II SN Survey is carried\nout during three seasons, September through November\nof 2005\u20132007 and found about 1500 SNe (Frieman et al.\n2008). The public SDSS SNe candidates are listed on the\n\nWorld Wide Web.5\n2.2. The Main Galaxies\nThe SDSS photometric survey covers \u223c360 million objects over 11,000 deg2 . The photometric catalog derived\nfrom the SDSS photometric survey lists the photometric\nparameters, such as apparent magnitude, color, photometric redshift, and the extinction, which is also used for\nthe target selection of spectroscopic observations (Eisenstein, et al. 2001).\nThe SDSS Main galaxy sample is derived from the\nSDSS spectroscopic survey. Analysis of SDSS Main\ngalaxy spectroscopic sample (Strauss et al. 2002) has\ntypically been limited to a galactic extinction corrected\nPetrosian magnitude mr = 14.5 at the bright end due\nto two effects: (1) the bright galaxies with large flux\nwithin 3\u2032\u2032 fiber aperture cause saturation and cross-talk\nin the spectrographs, and (ii) their large angular size\nand substructures make them shredded into several objects and then cause problems for the spectroscopic target selection. The exclusion of the galaxies brighter than\nmr = 14.5 leads to decrease in the possible range of luminosity to be explored at a given redshift and in the\noverall number of galaxies when a volume-limited sample is constructed.\nA subset of the SDSS Main galaxy sample used in many\nstudies is the New York University-Value Added Galaxy\nCatalog Large-scale Structure Sample6 (brvoid0) (NYUVAGC LSS; Blanton et al. 2005) with apparent magnitude in the range 10 < mr \u2264 17.6 and redshift in the\nrange 0.001 < z < 0.5. To supplement bright galaxies to\nthis NYU-VAGC LSS, Choi et al. (2007) and Y.-Y. Choi\net al. (2010, in preparation) constructed the Korea Institute for Advanced Study-Value Added Galaxy Catalog\n(KIAS-VAGC) by supplementing bright galaxies whose\nphysical parameters have been compiled from earlier catalogs, such as Updated Zwicky Catalog (UZC; Falco et\nal. 1999), IRAS Point Source Catalog Redshift Survey\n(PSCz; Saunders et al. 2000), 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS; Colless et al. 2001), and Third Reference\nCatalogue of Bright Galaxies (RC3; de Vaucouleurs et al.\n1991). The KIAS-VAGC sample includes 583,946 galaxies with 10 < mr \u2264 17.6 of NYU-VAGC LSS, brvoid0,\nbased on SDSS Data Release 7 (DR7) and 10,497 galaxies with 10 < mr \u2264 17.6 (1455 with 10 < mr \u2264 14.5)\nwhose redshifts come from sources other than SDSS. In\nthis work, we extend the apparent magnitude limit to\nmr = 17.77 at the faint end, which add 114,303 redshifts\nof galaxies with 17.6 < mr \u2264 17.77 in the LSS Sample (full0) of NYU VAGC to the KIAS-VAGC above.\nTherefore, in total we use 708,746 galaxies. This KIASVAGC contains 20,167 galaxies distributed in a region\nwith \u221251\u25e6 < R.A. < 60\u25e6 of Stripe 82. We use these\ngalaxies to construct our Main galaxy sample in this\nstudy. The Main galaxies in NYU-VAGC at a distance\nbelow 64 h\u22121 Mpc are corrected for peculiar velocity using a model of the local velocity field based on IRAS\n1.2 Jy redshift survey (Willick et al. 1997). Outer that\nradius, the peculiar velocity can be neglected (see the\ncaveat Blanton et al. 2005 for details).\nThe morphology of galaxies in the Main galaxy sample\n5\n6\n\nhttp://sdssdp47.fnal.gov/sdsssn/sdsssn.html\nhttp://sdss.physics.nyu.edu/vagc/lss.html\n\n\fTYPE Ia SUPERNOVA IN THE SDSS\n\n3\n\nFig. 1.- Distribution of SNe Ia and the Main galaxies with\n14.5 < mr < 17.77 in the Stripe 82. Dots are the Main galaxies\nand filled circles indicate SNe Ia.\n\nis classified by the automatic morphology classification of\nPark & Choi (2005). It is a new morphology classification scheme that uses the color\u2013color gradient space and\nthe concentration index. The morphology of the Main\ngalaxies is classified into two types: early (ellipticals and\nlenticulars; E and S0) and late (spirals and irregulars; S\nand Irr) types. The completeness and reliability of the\nmorphology classification reaches about 90% (Park et al.\n2008; see Table 1 of Park & Choi 2005).\n2.3. Type Ia Supernovae and their Host Galaxies\nDuring the entire season, the SDSS-II SN Survey discovered about 1,500 SN candidates, and 612 of them were\nspectroscopically confirmed as SNe Ia. Figure 1 shows\nthe distribution of these 612 SNe Ia in the R.A. versus\nredshift space. Out of 612 SNe Ia, 594 SNe Ia are located\nwithin the coordinate boundary of the Main galaxy sample since the range of the SDSS-II SN Survey is wider in\nRA than that of the Main galaxy sample in the Stripe\n82.\nWe first searched for the host galaxies in the SDSS\nphotometric catalog. A galaxy in the catalog that has\nthe smallest, yet no larger than 6\u2032\u2032 , angular separation\nfrom the SN was identified as the host galaxy. Although\ngalaxies in the SDSS photometric catalog have photometric redshifts, their errors of 0.024 at 68% confidence\nlevel (Oyaizu et al. 2008) are too large to be used for the\nvelocity comparison. We found host galaxies of 512 SNe\nIa in the SDSS photometric catalog. Most of them are\nfaint with the apparent magnitude mr > 17.77, therefore\nnot in the spectroscopic Main galaxy sample. We could\nnot find the host galaxies of remaining 82 SNe either from\nthe photometric catalog or from the SDSS images.\nWe then searched for the host galaxies of the 594 SNe\nIa again in the spectroscopic Main galaxy sample. Since\nall galaxies in the spectroscopic sample have accurate\nredshift information, we can select galaxies that have\nthe radial velocity difference from the SNe Ia less than\n|\u2206v| = 1000 km s\u22121 , out of which we identify the galaxy\nthat has the smallest angular separation from the SN as\nits host galaxy. We found host galaxies of 68 SNe Ia this\nway, all of which were the same host galaxies identified\nby the photometric catalog. So we expect that all 512\nhost galaxies identified are the closest galaxies to the SN\nin terms of angular separation and within the limited vol-\n\nFig. 2.- Distribution of SN Ia host galaxies and the Main galaxies in the redshift-absolute magnitude space.

Morphologies of those from photometric catalog\nwere determined by visual inspection only.\nThe absolute magnitudes of 512 candidate host galaxies that have the spectroscopic and photometric data\nfrom either the KIAS-VAGC or the SDSS photometric\ncatalog were calculated. To determine the absolute magnitude the redshifts of galaxies are needed. The redshifts\nof most candidate host galaxies that are in the SDSS\nphotometric catalog, but not in the Main galaxy sample, are taken from NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database\n(NED).8 For the remaining host galaxies whose redshifts\nare not in NED, it was assumed that the host galaxy has\nthe same redshift as that of the SN.\nThe absolute magnitudes of host galaxies are calculated from the following formula\nMr = mr \u2212 5 log[dc (1 + z)] \u2212 25 \u2212 K(z) \u2212 \u0112(z),\n\n(1)\n\nwhere dc is the co\u2013moving distance, K is the Kcorrection as determined according to Blanton et al.\n(2003), and \u0112(z) is the mean luminosity evolution correction given by Tegmark et al.

To guarantee high completeness of\nthe cluster sample, clusters with the galactic latitude,\n|b| > 40\u25e6 (Abell 1958; Abell et al. 1989), richness class 0\nand with z \u2264 0.08 were chosen. The distribution of the\nAbell clusters used in this work (filled circles) and SN Ia\nhost galaxies (open circles) are shown in Figure 3. The\nsolid line indicates the galactic latitude b = \u221240.\n3. RESULTS\n\nThree slightly different samples of SN Ia host galaxies\nand the Main galaxies suitable for each analysis are constructed: Host-1 and Main-1 are used for the analysis\nof the properties and environments of galaxies, Host-2\nand Main-2 for the investigation of the effects by galaxy\ncluster, and Host-3 and Main-3 for the analysis of the\nlarge-scale environment, respectively. The summary of\nthe three samples is listed in Table 1, and the details of\nthe samples are described in the following sections.\n3.1. Properties of SN Ia Host Galaxies\n3.1.1.

Early types (E/S0) are used in the\nmiddle panel and late types (S/Irr) are used in the bottom panel.\n\nstruct a host galaxy sample (Host-1) that has the same\nselection criteria as the Main galaxy sample (Main-1).\nWe select host galaxies with the apparent magnitude\nmr < 17.77, the magnitude limit of the Main galaxy\nsample, but without the redshift limit. The absolute\nmagnitude limit corresponding to this apparent magnitude limit of redshift z is obtained by\nMr,lim = 17.77\u22125 log[dc (1+z)]\u221225\u2212 K\u0304(z)\u2212 \u0112(z), (3)\nwhere K\u0304(z) is the mean K-correction given by Choi et\nal. (2009). We define a Host-1 sample that consists of\n87 host galaxies with Mr < Mr,lim . Among 87 host\ngalaxies, 68 are found in the Main galaxy sample but\n19 are found only in the SDSS photometric catalog. In\nour morphology classification, 38 are early-type and 49\nlate-type galaxies. We construct a comparison sample,\nMain-1, drawn from the SDSS Main galaxy catalog. It\ncontains 8,815 early-type and 11,352 late-type galaxies\nthat are brighter than mr = 17.77 and located within\nthe Stripe 82.\nFigure 4 shows the g \u2212 r (left panels) and u \u2212 r (right\npanels) color distributions. The dashed lines show the\ncolor distribution of all (top panels), E/S0-type (middle\npanels), and S/Irr-type (bottom panels) Main galaxies.\nThe solid lines show the color distribution for each type\nof galaxies in Host-1 and \"f' means a fraction of galaxies\nat each bin compared to the whole galaxy sample. The\nfigures show that the color distributions of host galaxies\nare similar to that of the Main galaxies.\nThe deviation in the distribution of f and the statisti-\n\ncal significance of the test for each property and environment are estimated by the bootstrap resampling method.\nThe bootstrap resampling infers the statistics of samples\nbased on many resamples generated from the original\nsample. Each resample has the same size as the original\nsample. For example, to estimate the uncertainty of the\nhost galaxy g \u2212r color distribution, we extract each mock\ngalaxy randomly from the host galaxy sample until the\nsize of the resample, i.e., the collection of mock galaxies generated, reach that of the host galaxy sample. We\ngenerated 10, 000 resamples in this way and calculated\nthe standard deviation at each bin from these resamples.\nThe standard deviations are shown in Figure 4 as error\nbars.\nThe statistical significance of the difference between\nthe color distributions of the host galaxies and the Main\ngalaxies was tested by comparing the median colors of\nthe host galaxies with that of the Main galaxies. We\ngenerate 10, 000 mock samples from the Main galaxies\nby the bootstrap resampling method that had the same\nsample size as the host galaxy sample. Then the number\nof samples whose median color is larger than the median\nof the host galaxy sample was counted.\nFor the u \u2212 r and g \u2212 r color properties, no significant\ndifference was found between the medians of the host\ngalaxies and the Main galaxies at 95% confidence level.\nHowever, it is more interesting to investigate the color\nproperties of SN Ia host galaxies normalized to the stellar\nmasses.\nWe also checked the SN Ia rate per unit stellar mass.\nThe stellar masses of SN Ia host galaxies are estimated\n\n\f6\n\nHAN ET AL.\nTABLE 2\nMedian of the SN Ia Host Galaxies and the Probability.\nProperties and Environments\nAbsolute magnitude\nLocal density\n((h\u22121 Mpc)\u22122 )\n\nDistance to the nearest neighbor\n(r1 /rvir,nei )\nDistance to the nearest Abell cluster\n(h\u22121 Mpc)\n\nMorphology\n\nMedian of SN Ia Host\n\nMedian of Main Galaxies\n\nProbability (%)\n\nCombined\nE/S0\nS/Irr\nCombined\nE/S0\nS/Irr\nCombined\nE/S0\nS/Irr\nCombined\n\n-20.61\n-20.64\n-20.45\n0.028\n0.028\n0.023\n2.52\n2.25\n2.70\n6.15\n\n-20.31\n-20.47\n-20.19\n0.034\n0.044\n0.029\n1.72\n1.45\n1.92\n17.75\n\n0.8\n13.4\n5.6\n16.9\n12.7\n23.4\n2.6\n6.7\n7.6\n0.4\n\nerrors.

The top panel shows a combined sample of the Main galaxies\nand SN Ia host galaxies. Early types (E/S0) are used in the middle\npanel and late types (S/Irr) are used in the bottom panel.\n\nfrom the relation between the colors of galaxies and their\nstellar mass-to-light ratios. Kauffmann et al. (2003) calculated the stellar mass-to-light ratios for about 120,000\ngalaxies from the SDSS, which show a tight relation between the g-band stellar mass-to-light ratio and g \u2212 r\ncolor (Kauffmann et al. 2003). The stellar masses of\nour host galaxies are estimated from this correlation. We\nfind that the SN Ia rate per 100yr per 1011 M\u2299 in the host\ngalaxies bluer than g \u2212r = 0.5, is 0.122+0.087\n\u22120.077 , larger than\nthe rate 0.008+0.005\nin\nthe\nhost\ngalaxies\nwith g \u2212 r > 1.0.\n\u22120.004\nThe errors include the standard deviation for the relation\nof stellar mass-to-light ratio versus color and the Poisson\n\nIn theanalysis of the absolute magnitude, we use the\nSN Ia host galaxies (Host-1) and the Main galaxies\n(Main-1). The absolute magnitude of the host galaxies\nand the Main galaxies in the r band are obtained with\nEquation (1). Figure 5 shows the distribution of the rband absolute magnitude, Mr , of the host galaxies (Host1, solid line) and the Main galaxies (Main-1, dashed line)\nfor each type. Compared to the Main galaxies, the host\ngalaxies show a higher fraction near Mr \u223c \u221221 which\nis a little brighter than the characteristic absolute magnitude Mr,\u22c6 \u2248 \u221220.3 of the Main galaxies (Choi et al.\n2007). Error bars are calculated by the same bootstrap\nmethod described in Section 3.1.1. The distribution of\nthe host galaxies at the luminous end of Mr < \u221221.3 is\nsimilar to that of the Main galaxies. However, the fraction of the host galaxies at the faint end of Mr > \u221220\nis lower than the fraction of the Main galaxies while the\nfraction of the host galaxies with the intermediate luminosity, \u221221.5 < Mr < \u221220, is higher than that of\nthe Main galaxies. The difference is greater for late-type\ngalaxies as shown in Figure 5. So it seems that SNe\nIa prefer slightly brighter galaxies as hosts, but not too\nbright ones. Gallagher et al. (2005) reached a similar\nconclusion, and in addition showed that the distribution\nis reasonably well explained by the product of the luminosity function of galaxies with the number of stars in\neach galaxy.\nWe check the median for 74 host galaxies with \u221218.3 >\nMr > \u221221.3. The median Mr of host galaxies is \u221220.61\nwhile that of the Main galaxies is \u221220.31. A bootstrap resampling shows that the probability P to find by\nchance a median absolute magnitude of the Main galaxies brighter than that of the host galaxies is only 0.8% for\nthe combined sample. This means that the median Mr of\nthe host galaxies is significantly brighter than that of the\nMain galaxies at more than 99% confidence level. On the\nother hand, the median Mr of early-type host galaxies is\n\u221220.64 compared to \u221220.45 of early-type Main galaxies\nwithin the same magnitude interval. The corresponding\nprobability is P = 13.4%. The median Mr of late-type\nhost is \u221220.45 compared to \u221220.19 of late-type Main\ngalaxies with the corresponding probability of P = 5.6%.\nThe results are summarized in Table 2.\n\n\fTYPE Ia SUPERNOVA IN THE SDSS\n\n7\n\nFig. 7.- Distribution of the distance to the nearest Abell cluster\nrA .

Early types (E/S0) are used in the middle panel and late\ntypes (S/Irr) are used in the bottom panel.\n\n3.2. Environments of SN Ia Host Galaxies\n3.2.1. The nearest neighbor\nWe use the distance to the nearest neighbor galaxy as\none of the environmental parameters. Park et al. (2008)\nand Park & Choi (2009) found that the galaxy luminosity\nand morphology depend on the distance to the nearest\nneighbor galaxy and also on neighbor morphology. In\nthis section, we investigate whether or not occurrence of\nSNe Ia is related to the nearest neighbor galaxy.\nFor both SN Ia host galaxies (Host-1) and the Main\ngalaxies (Main-1), the nearest neighbor was searched\namong the Main galaxies and determined in the following\nway. The nearest neighbor is required to have the radial\nvelocity difference less than |\u2206v| = 1000 km s\u22121 with\nrespect to a target galaxy, and has the smallest angular\nseparation from the target. Since Park & Choi (2009)\nhave shown that the important length scale in the study\nof galaxy environments is the virial radius of the nearest neighbor galaxy, the distance was normalized by the\nvirial radius rvir of the nearest neighbor, defined by\n\u0012\n\u00131/3\n3\u03b3L\nrvir =\n,\n(4)\n4\u03c0 \u00d7 200\u03c1c\nwhere \u03b3 is the mass-to-light ratio, L is the r-band luminosity, and \u03c1c is the critical density of the universe\n(Park & Choi 2009). Following Park et al. (2008), we\n\nassume \u03b3(early) = 2\u03b3(late) at the same r-band luminosity, and adopt the mean mass density of the universe \u03c1\u0304 = (0.0223 \u00b1 0.0005)(\u03b3L)\u221220 (h\u22121 Mpc)\u22123 , where\n(\u03b3L)\u221220 is the mass of a late-type galaxy with Mr = \u221220\n(Park et al. 2008).\nPark & Choi (2009) found that isolated galaxies are\nbrighter than those that have neighbors at relatively\ncloser distances. Hence the dependence of the SN rate on\nthe nearest neighbor distance is likely to be affected by\nthe dependence on the luminosity of the host galaxy. To\nisolate the dependence on the nearest neighbor distance,\nweights were given to host galaxies when the distribution of r1 /rvir,nei is calculated. The weight of a host\ngalaxy with Mr is given by the ratio of the fractions of\nthe host and Main galaxies at a given magnitude Mr , i.e.,\nfMain /fhost from Figure 5, to remove the dependency\non Mr .\nFigure 6 shows the resulting distribution of the nearest\nneighbor distance (r1 ) normalized by the virial radius\nof the nearest neighbor (rvir,nei ) for Host-1 (solid line)\nand Main-1 (dashed line) galaxies. It can be seen that\nthe distribution of r1 of SN Ia host galaxies is shifted to\nlarger separations compared to that of the Main galaxies.\nThis is observed for both morphological subsets.\nThe median r1 /rvir,nei of the host galaxies was compared with those of mock samples drawn from the Main\ngalaxy catalog. The host galaxies have the median\nr1 /rvir,nei = 2.52 compare to 1.72 of the Main galaxies.\nA bootstrap resampling experiment shows P = 2.6% to\nhave such a difference in the median by chance. In the\ncase of early-type galaxies we find r1 /rvir,nei = 2.25\nand P = 6.7%, and for late types r1 /rvir,nei = 2.70 and\nP = 7.6%. This implies that SNe Ia are more likely to\noccur in isolated galaxies without close neighbors within\n\n\f8\n\nHAN ET AL.\n\nthe virial radius.\n3.2.2. Distance to the nearest cluster\nNext, we ask the question if SN Ia host galaxies are\nin a different cluster environment compared to the Main\ngalaxies. Since our selected Abell clusters have z \u2264 0.08,\nwe construct a sample, Host-2, that consists of 21 SN Ia\nhost galaxies that are in the Main galaxy sample, therefore mr < 17.77, and have z \u2264 0.08.\nThe distance to the nearest Abell cluster was derived\nin two steps. The velocity difference and the angular\nseparation between the target host galaxy and the center of a selected Abell cluster was calculated. Among\nthe Abell clusters that have a velocity difference smaller\nthan \u223c 1500 km s\u22121 with respect to the target galaxy,\nwe select the nearest one having the smallest projected\ndistance rA to the target SN Ia host galaxy at the host\ngalaxy's redshift. If the projected distance rA is greater\nthan 15h\u22121 Mpc, then this host galaxy is not likely to be\na member of the nearest Abell cluster. In such cases, we\nchoose the three dimensional distance from the center of\nthe cluster to the target host galaxy with radial distance\nestimated from the redshift difference. Figure 7 shows\nthe distributions of rA of the Main galaxies (dashed line)\nand the host galaxies (solid line). Two distributions show\na visible difference despite large uncertainties.\nThe Host-2 galaxy sample has the median rA of 6.14\nh\u22121 Mpc while the Main galaxies have the median rA\nof 17.75 h\u22121 Mpc, and the probability of having such a\ndifference in rA is P = 0.4%. Therefore, it is statistically\nsignificant that the host galaxies are located closer to the\nAbell clusters compared to the Main galaxies. Mannucci\net al. (2008) reported that cluster early-type galaxies\nhave a significantly higher SN Ia rate than field earlytype galaxies that cannot be explained by observational\nbiases. Although our samples are not limited to earlytype galaxies, our result also shows SN Ia host galaxies\ntend to be located near massive galaxy clusters.\n3.2.3. Local density\nMany studies have investigated the relationships between the galaxy properties and the local density\n(Dressler 1980; Lewis et al. 2002; Goto et al. 2003;\nBalogh et al. 2004; Baldry et al. 2006; Cooper et al.\n2006, 2007, 2008; Park et al. 2007; Park et al. 2008;\nPark & Choi 2009; Park & Hwang 2009; Hwang & Park\n2009; Bamford et al. 2009). Dressler (1980) first employed the projected local density based on counting the\nnumber of the nearby neighbor galaxies and defined the\nlocal density as \u03a3n = N/(\u03c0Dn2 ) where Dn is the distance\nto the nth nearest neighbor galaxy.\nIn this study, we adopt the projected local density\nbased on the fifth nearest neighbor galaxy as the density estimator. To search for the fifth nearest neighbor\ngalaxy, a volume-limited sample of density tracer galaxies\nwas constructed with the absolute magnitude in r-band\nMr \u2264 \u221221 and the redshift in the range 0.03 \u2264 z \u2264 0.17\nsince the redshift limit corresponding to Mr,lim = \u221221\nis z = 0.17 in the case of the Main galaxies. The density\ntracers are those within the rectangular box at the upper left corner of Figure 2. A sample of galaxies that are\nwithin the same redshift limits of the density tracer and\nthe apparent magnitude limit of the Main galaxies were\n\nFig. 8.- Same as in Figure 6 but for the local density.\n\nthen selected. We call this sample Host-3. It consists of\n31 early types and 46 late types. We also call the Main\ngalaxies in the same volume as Main-3.\nWe find the fifth nearest neighbors of the Host-3 and\nMain-3 galaxies among the density tracer galaxies. It is\nthe fifth nearest galaxy in terms of angular separation\nand has the velocity difference |\u2206v| \u2264 1000 km s\u22121 with\nrespect to a target galaxy. The adopted local density\nestimator is\n5\n,\n(5)\n\u03a35 =\n\u03c0D52\nwhere D5 is the projected distance from the target galaxy\nto the fifth nearest neighbor galaxy at the redshift of\nthe target galaxy. The distribution of \u03a35 around SN Ia\nhost galaxies and the Main galaxies is shown for each\nmorphological subset in Figure 8. The solid line and\ndashed line correspond to the host galaxy sample and\nthe Main galaxy sample, respectively.\nFigure 8 shows that the distribution of \u03a35 of SN Ia\nhosts has a peak shifted to lower density regions compared to that of the Main galaxies. This is consistent\nwith the finding in Section 3.2.1 that the SN Ia host\ngalaxies tend to be isolated ones. There exists a slight\nexcess in SN Ia occurrence for galaxies at very high densities (\u03a35 > 0.2 (h\u22121 Mpc)\u22122 ), which is again consistent\nwith the result of the cluster environment study, but the\nstatistical significance is not high. The median \u03a35 of\nthese host galaxies is \u03a35 = 0.028 while that of the Main\ngalaxies is 0.035, and the probability of having such a difference is P = 16.92%. In the case of early-type galaxies\n\n\fTYPE Ia SUPERNOVA IN THE SDSS\nwe find P = 12.65%, and for late types P = 23.40%.\n4. SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION\n\nThe SDSS-II Supernova Survey has found about 612\nspectroscopically confirmed SNe Ia in the Stripe 82 centered on the celestial equator covering an area of 300\ndeg2 . We found the host galaxies associated with 512\nSNe Ia using the SDSS photometric and spectroscopic\ncatalogs. The Main galaxies were used as a comparison\nsample. A sample of Abell cluster was also used to investigate the effects of nearby clusters on SN Ia occurrence.\nStatistical tests were performed to compare the distribution of the host galaxies with those of the mock samples generated from the distribution of the Main galaxies.\nOur results are as follows.\n1. The color distribution of SN Ia host galaxies is almost same as that of the Main galaxies, regardless\nof the galaxy morphology. However, the SN Ia rate\nper unit stellar mass is higher in bluer galaxies than\nin redder galaxies.\n2. Independent of morphological type, we find that\nSNe Ia are most likely to occur in galaxies with\nMr \u223c \u221221 mag. Furthermore, we find an underabundance of SNe Ia in galaxies brighter than\nMr \u223c \u221219.8, also independent of morphological\ntype. Finally, for galaxies brighter than Mr \u2264\n\u221221.5 the luminosity distribution of SN Ia host is\nstatistically similar to that of the Main galaxies.\n3. Isolated galaxies tend to have SN Ia more frequently than galaxies having neighbors within their\nvirial radius.\n4. SN Ia host galaxies tend to be located near massive\ngalaxy clusters in agreement with previous works\n(Mannucci et al. 2008; Carlberg et al. 2008).\nMany studies have been made on SN rate versus properties and environments of their host galaxies. Cappellaro et al. (1993) measured the SN rate from 54 SNe\ndiscovered by SN searches carried out at the Asiago and\nSternberg Observatories. These samples have lower redshifts than SDSS samples and contain only 15 SN Ia.\nThey found that the SN events are proportional to the\ngalaxy luminosity regardless of the morphology and the\nSN Ia rate in early types is smaller than that in late\ntypes. This result, however, is uncertain because of the\nsmall number of sample galaxies. Our result using a\nlarger sample of 87 SN Ia data suggests that SN Ia events\nhave dependence on the luminosity of their host galaxies\nregardless of the morphology except for most luminous\ngalaxies. The result shows that SNe Ia prefer not to occur in too bright or too dim galaxies. However, part of\nthis dependence can be explained by selection effect that\nthere are fewer SNe in low-luminosity galaxies and SNe\nhosted by early-type galaxies are fainter (Gallagher et al.\n2005).\nMannucci et al. (2005) have studied the SN Ia rate per\nunit stellar mass as a function of B \u2212 K color for nearby\ngalaxies. They found that blue galaxies have a higher SN\nIa rate than red galaxies. When we normalize the SN Ia\nrate to the stellar mass, the SN Ia rate shows a similar\n\n9\n\nresult that the SN Ia rate in the bluer galaxies is larger\nthan in the redder galaxies with respect to g \u2212 r \u223c 0.7.\nSharon et al. (2007) studied cluster SN rate in lowredshift galaxy clusters with 0.06 < z < 0.19 and found\nthat the SN rate in a galaxy cluster is similar to the rate\nin a field elliptical galaxy. This is also based on a small\nSNe Ia sample. Our analysis of the environment effects of\nnearby Abell clusters on the host galaxies shows that SN\nIa events are more frequent in the galaxies located close\nto massive galaxy clusters. This is in agreement with the\nfinding that the host galaxies are more clustered than the\nfield galaxies (Carlberg et al. 2008).\nA recent study using SDSS-II SN data with 0.05 < z <\n0.15 by Cooper et al. (2009) found that SN Ia events\nin blue host galaxies prefer to occur in the low-density\nregion while there is no difference between the environment distributions of red host galaxies and galaxies of\nlike properties. We also find a weak signal that the SN Ia\nrate is higher for galaxies located in relatively low density\nregions regardless of their morphologies. On the other\nhand, analysis of the distance to the neighbor galaxy\nshows that SN Ia events are more frequent in isolated\ngalaxies without close neighbors.\nD.-H.H., C.B.P., and M.- G.P. acknowledges the support of the National Research Foundation of Korea\n(NRF) grant funded by the Korea government MEST\n(No. 2009-0062868).
