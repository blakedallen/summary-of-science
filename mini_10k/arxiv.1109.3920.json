To study\ncomplex and geometric structures of bounded domains, one may consider holomorphic maps form bounded domains to some standard domains such as balls and\nvice visa. The basic idea goes back to Carath\u00e9odory, and a typical example is\nthe definition of Carath\u00e9odory metric and Kobayashi metric. Holomorphic maps\nfrom bounded domains to the unit ball with certain extremal properties are called\nCarath\u00e9odory maps, which can be explicitly given for some special domains such\nas bounded symmetric domains [11][13] and ellipsoids [17]. Recently, by considering embeddings of general bounded domains into the unit ball, a new concept of\nholomorphic homogeneous regular domains was introduced in [14]. Holomorphic\nhomogeneous regular domains are generalizations of Teichm\u00fcller spaces, and they\nadmit some nice geometric and analytic properties (see [14][21]).\nMotivated by the works mentioned above, especially that in [14], we introduce\nthe notion of squeezing functions defined on general bounded domains as follows:\nDefinition 1.1. Let D be a bounded domain in Cn . For p \u2208 D and an (open)\nholomorphic embedding f : D \u2192 B n with f (p) = 0, we define\nsD (p, f ) = sup{r|B n (0, r) \u2282 f (D)},\n\nand the squeezing number sD (p) of D at p is defined as\nsD (p) = sup{sD (p, f )},\nf\n\n2010 Mathematics Subject Classification. Primary 32H02, 32F45.\nKey words. squeezing function, extremal map, holomorphic homogeneous regular domain.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nFUSHENG DENG, QIAN GUAN, AND LIYOU ZHANG\n\nwhere the supremum is taken over all holomorphic embeddings f : D \u2192 B n with\nf (p) = 0, B n is the unit ball in Cn and B n (0, r) is the ball in Cn with center 0 and\nradius r. We call sD the squeezing function on D.\nBy definition, it is clear that squeezing functions are invariant under biholomorphic transformations, so they can be viewed as a kind of holomorphic invariants of\nbounded domains. The main purpose of the present paper is to investigate some\nproperties of squeezing functions and their relations with geometric and analytic\nstructures of bounded domains.\nSqueezing functions are always positive and bounded above by 1. It is interesting\nto estimate their lower and upper bounds, which are numerical holomorphic invariants of bounded domains, by the holomorphic invariance of squeezing functions.\nHolomorphic homogeneous regular domains defined in [14] are exactly bounded domains whose squeezing functions admit positive lower bounds. They contain some\ninteresting objects such as bounded homogeneous domains, Teichm\u00fcller spaces,\nbounded domains covering compact K\u00e4hler manifolds and strictly convex domains\nwith C 2 -boundary [21].\nIt is easy to see that the squeezing function of the unit ball B n is constant with\nvalue 1. A natural question is whether the squeezing function of a bounded domain\nD can attain the value 1 at some point x in D if D is not holomorphic equivalent to\nB n ? This question is related to the existence of an extremal map which realizes the\nsupremum sD (x), i.e., the existence of a holomorphic embedding f : D \u2192 B n such\nthat f (x) = 0 and B n (0, sD (x)) \u2282 f (D). We will prove the existence of extremal\nmaps, by using a higher dimensional generalization of Hurwitz theorem that will be\nproved as well in the present article. As a consequence, SD attains the value 1 in D\nif and only if D is holomorphic equivalent to the unit ball. On the other hand, as\nwe will see, there exist domains whose squeezing functions have supremum 1, but\nthey are not holomorphic equivalent to the unit ball.\nAn elementary property of regularity of squeezing functions is their continuity.\nIt can be proved by using the decreasing property of Kobayashi metrics. From the\ncontinuity property, one can see that a bounded domain is a holomorphic homogeneous regular domain if it covers a compact complex manifold.\nProperties of squeezing functions can reflect some geometric and analytic properties of bounded domains. Boundary behavior of squeezing functions implies certain\nboundary estimate of Carath\u00e9odory metric, which implies completeness of the metric in some special cases. For a bounded domain whose squeezing function admits a\npositive lower bound, i.e. a holomorphic homogeneous regular domain, it is known\nthat the intrinsic metrics \u2013 the Carath\u00e9odory metric, the Kobayashi metric and the\nBergman metric \u2013 on it are equivalent [14], and they are all complete [21]. We will\nprove the completeness of these metrics by alternative method based on Lu's result\non comparsion of Bergman metric and Carath\u00e9odory metric [16]. A result in several\ncomplex variables states that completeness of the Carath\u00e9odory metric of a domain\nimplies its pseudoconvexity (see e.g. [8]), hence a holomorphic homogeneous regular\ndomain must be a pseudoconvex domain.\nSqueezing functions of planar domains have nice properties. For finitely connected planar domains, we get a neat description of the boundary behavior of their\nsqueezing functions. As a result, we get the necessary and sufficient condition for\nsuch a domain to be a holomorphic homogeneous regular domain. Surprisingly,\n\n\fON SOME PROPERTIES OF SQUEEZING FUNCTIONS OF BOUNDED DOMAINS\n\n3\n\nthe squeezing function sD of a bounded planar domain D with smooth boundary\nadmits the boundary behavior\nlim sD (z) = 1.\n\nz\u2192\u2202D\n\n(1)\n\nBy the continuity of squeezing functions, equality (1) implies that all smoothly\nbounded planar domains are holomorphic homogeneous regular domains. As a result, we can recover some important results about planar domains, e.g., the three\nintrinsic metrics mentioned above on a bounded planar domain with smooth boundary are all complete, and they are equivalent, and a smoothly bounded planar\ndomain must be hyperconvex, i.e., it admits a bounded exhaustive subharmonic\nfunction. In particular, equality (1) also implies that sD can be extended continuously to D for a planar domain D with smooth boundary. We don't know whether\nthis is true in general case, i.e., whether sD can be extended continuously to D for\nall bounded domains D \u2282 Cn with smooth boundary.\nIt is clear that the product of two holomorphic homogeneous regular domains\nis still a holomorphic homogeneous regular domain, so smoothly bounded planar\ndomains and their products provide a class of holomorphic homogeneous regular\ndomains which are generally not contained in the list of holomorphic homogeneous\nregular domains mentioned above. As remarked in [14], it may be interesting to\ninvestigate whether the Kobayashi metric and the Carath\u00e9odory metric on a Teichm\u00fcller space coincide or not; on the other hand, the Kobayashi metric and the\nCarath\u00e9odory metric on general holomorphic homogeneous regular domains constructed here don't coincide.\nThe simplest nontrivial smoothly bounded planar domains are annuli. However,\neven in this special case, squeezing functions admit nontrivial properties. With\ncertain investigation, we conjecture that the conformal structure of an annulus is\ncharacterized by the exact lower bound of its squeezing function.\nThe squeezing functions can be given explicitly for classical bounded symmetric\ndomains. In this special case, we see that the extremal maps for squeezing functions\ndefined as above can be given by the Carath\u00e9odory maps (see \u00a77 for exact definition). However, this does not hold for general domains such as annuli. In fact, the\nCarath\u00e9odory maps (often called Ahlfors maps for planar domains) of a bounded\nplanar domain can not even be injective if the domain is not simply connected (see\ne.g. [5]). It seems that the obstruction for the coincidence of the two types of\nextremal maps comes from topology. Therefore, we conjecture that the extremal\nmaps of a contractible domain are given by Carath\u00e9odory maps.\nThe rest of this article is organized as follows. In \u00a72, we generalize the Hurwitz\ntheorem from one complex variable analysis to several complex variables, and use\nthis generalization to establish the existence of extremal maps that are defined as\nabove; In \u00a73, we prove the continuity of squeezing functions of general bounded\ndomains; In \u00a74, we give a boundary estimate of Carath\u00e9odory metrics in term of\nboundary behavior of squeezing functions, and prove the completeness of certain\nintrinsic metrics on holomorphic homogeneous regular domains , as a corollary, we\nget the pseudoconvexity of these domains; In \u00a75, we study squeezing functions on\nplanar domains, and prove equality (1) of smoothly bounded planar domains, we\nalso construct a class of planar holomorphic homogeneous regular domains which\nare infinitely connected; In \u00a76, we focus on squeezing functions on annuli, and in\n\n\f4\n\nFUSHENG DENG, QIAN GUAN, AND LIYOU ZHANG\n\nthe final \u00a77, we give some examples of bounded domains whose squeezing functions\ncan be given explicitly.\nAcknowledgements.

Generalized Hurwitz Theorem and the existence of extremal\nfunctions\nThe main aim of this section is to establish the existence of extremal maps related\nto squeezing functions, i.e., the following\nTheorem 2.1. Let D be a bounded domain in Cn , then for any x \u2208 D, there exists a\nholomorphic embedding f : D \u2192 B n such that f (x) = 0 and B n (0, sD (x)) \u2282 f (D).\nBy definition we have sD (z) \u2264 1 for all z \u2208 D. By Theorem 2.1, we see that\nsD (z) = 1 for some z \u2208 D if and only if D is holomorphically equivalent to B n .\nTo prove Theorem 2.1, we need to generalize Hurwitz's theorem in classical\ncomplex analysis to several complex variables. Hurwitz's theorem in one complex\nvariable says that the limit of a sequence of univalent functions on a planar domain\nis univalent unless it is constant (see e.g. [18]). Of course there is no direct generalization of this result in higher dimensions, however, a modified version described\nin the following theorem still holds:\nTheorem 2.2. Let D be a bounded domain in Cn and x \u2208 D, let fi be a sequence\nof injective holomorphic maps from D to Cn such that fi (x) = 0 \u2208 Cn for all i.\nSuppose fi converges to a map f : D \u2192 Cn uniformly on compact subsets of D. If\nthere exists a neighborhood U of 0 in Cn such that U \u2282 fi (D) for all i, then f is\ninjective.\nTo prove Theorem 2.2, we need two lemmas. The first is\nLemma 2.3. Let D be a domain in Cn and \u03c6i a sequence of holomorphic maps\nfrom D to Cn which is convergent to a map \u03c6 : D \u2192 Cn uniformly on compact\nsubsets of D. If all \u03c6i have no zero in D, then \u03c6 has no zero in D unless it is\nidentically zero.\nProof. By the identity theorem of holomorphic functions, we may assume D is a\nball. Assume there exists x \u2208 D such that \u03c6(x) = 0. For any point z \u2208 D, consider\nthe intersection of D and the complex line containing x and z, then a version of the\nclassical Hurwitz theorem (see Corollary in P. 162 in [18] ) implies that \u03c6(z) = 0.\nSo \u03c6 is identically zero on D.\n\u0003\nThe second lemma we need in the proof of Theorem 2.2 is the generalized\nRouch\u00e9's theorem in higher dimensions, whose proof relies on the mapping degree\ntheory in differential topology.\nLemma 2.4. (Theorem 3 in [15]) Let D be a bounded domain in Cn , suppose f\nand g are two holomorphic maps from D to Cn such that\nk g(z) k<k f (z) k, z \u2208 \u2202D\n\n\fON SOME PROPERTIES OF SQUEEZING FUNCTIONS OF BOUNDED DOMAINS\n\n5\n\nThen f and f + g have the same number of zeros in D, counting multiplicities,\nwhere k * k is the standard norm in Cn .\nWith the above two lemmas, we can give the proof of Theorem 2.2 as follows:\nProof. (Proof of Theorem 2.2)Let gi = fi\u22121 |U . By Montel theorem, the sequence\n{gi } is convergent to a holomorphic map g : U \u2192 Cn uniformly on compact subsets\nof U . Note that g(0) = x is a interior point of D, we can assume g(U ) \u2282 D by\ntaking U smaller enough. It is clear that fi gi = IdU for all i. Let i tends to \u221e, we\nget f g = IdU . This implies that the Jacobian determinant detJf (x) of f at x is not\nzero. Since fi are injective, detJfi (z) 6= 0 for all i and all z \u2208 D (see e.g. Theorem\n8.5 in [6]). Note that detJfi converges to detJf uniformly on compact subsets of\nD, by Lemma 2.3, we see that detJf (z) 6= 0 for all z \u2208 D. We prove f is injective.\nIf it is not the case, there exist z1 , z2 \u2208 D, z1 6= z2 , such that f (z1 ) = f (z2 ). Since\ndetJf 6= 0, we can choose a neighborhood \u03a9 \u2282\u2282 D of z1 such that f |\u03a9 is injective\nand z2 6\u2208 \u03a9. Set f \u0303i = fi \u2212 fi (z1 ) and f \u0303 = f \u2212 f (z1 ), then f \u0303i converges to f \u0303 uniformly\non \u03a9. Note that f \u0303 has a zero in \u03a9 and f \u0303\u22121 (0) \u2229 \u2202\u03a9 = \u2205, by Lemma 2.4, f \u0303i has a\nzero in \u03a9 for i large enough, which contradicts to the fact that fi are all injective\non D.\n\u0003\nRemark 2.1. The assumptions in Theorem 2.2 that D is bounded and all fi (D)\ncontain a fixed neighborhood of 0 \u2208 Cn are necessary. In fact, the result in Theorem 2.2 does not hold without any one of the assumptions. For example, taking\nfi (z1 , z2 ) = (z1 , z2 /i) as a sequence holomorphic maps from D = C2 to itself, the\nlimit map f : D \u2192 C2 is given by f (z1 , z2 ) = (z1 , 0), it is not injective even fi are\ninjective and C2 \u2282 fi (D) for all i; the restrictions fi |B 2 give a sequence of injective\nholomorphic maps from B 2 to C2 with limit map f |B 2 , which is not injective since\nnot all fi (B 2 ) contain a fixed neighborhood of 0 \u2208 C2 . On the other hand, by a\nresult in [7], the two assumptions can be replaced by assuming that |detJfi (x)| have\na positive lower bound.\nUsing the results in Theorem 2.2 and Lemma 2.3, we give the proof of Theorem\n2.1:\nProof. (Proof of Theorem 2.1) By definition of squeezing functions, there exist a\nsequence of holomorphic embeddings fi : D \u2192 B n with fi (x) = 0, and a sequence\nof increasing positive numbers ri convergent to sD (x) such that B n (0, ri ) \u2282 fi (D).\nBy Montel theorem, there exists a subsequence {fik } of fi which converges to\na homomorphic map f : D \u2192 Cn uniformly on compact subsets of D. Since\nB n (0, r1 ) \u2282 fi (D) for all i, by Theorem 2.2, f is injective. In particular it is an open\nmap and hence f (D) \u2282 B n . Then we get a holomorphic embedding f : D \u2192 B n\nwith f (0) = 0.\nTo prove B n (0, sD (x)) \u2282 f (D), it suffices to prove B n (0, rj ) \u2282 f (D) for each fixed\ninteger j. By assumption, B n (0, rj ) \u2282 fi (D) for all i > j. Let gi = fi\u22121 |B n (0,rj ) ,\nthen we have fik gik = IdB n (0,rj ) for ik > j. By Montel theorem, we may assume\nthat the sequence {gik } converges to a holomorphic map g : B n (0, rj ) \u2192 Cn uniformly on compact subsets of B n (0, rj ). We want to prove that g(B n (0, rj )) \u2282 D.\nNote that g(0) = x, hence there exists a neighborhood U of 0 in B n (0, rj ) such\nthat g(U ) \u2282 D. This implies f * g|U is defined and it is clearly equal to the identity\nmap IdU . So detJg (0) 6= 0. Since detJgi 6= 0 for all i > i0 , by Lemma 2.3, we have\ndetJf 6= 0 and hence g is an open map, which implies that g(B n (0, rj )) \u2282 D.\n\n\f6\n\nFUSHENG DENG, QIAN GUAN, AND LIYOU ZHANG\n\nTherefore f g : B n (0, rj ) \u2192 B n (0, rj ) is a well defined map. It is clear that\nf g = IdB n (0,rj ) , so we have B n (0, rj ) \u2282 f (D).\n\u0003\n3. Continuity of squeezing functions\nIn this section, we will prove that the squeezing function on any bounded domain\nis continuous. As a consequence, a bounded domain is a holomorphic homogeneous\nregular domain if it covers a compact complex manifold.\nTheorem 3.1. The squeezing function sD of any bounded domain D in Cn is\ncontinuous.\nProof. Since D is a bounded domain, the Kobayashi metric on D is nondegenerate.\nLet a be an arbitrary point in D and {zk } be a sequence in D convergent to a, and\nlet \u01eb be an arbitrary positive number. By Theorem 2.1, there exists a holomorphic\nembedding f : D \u2192 B n such that f (a) = 0 and B n (0, sD (a)) \u2282 f (D). Since f\nis continuous, there exists an integer N such that ||f (zk )|| < \u01eb for k > N . Define\nfk : D \u2192 Cn as\nf (z) \u2212 f (zk )\nfk (z) =\n1+\u01eb\nfor k > N , then fk (D) \u2282 B n , fk (zk ) = 0 and\nsD (a) \u2212 \u01eb\n) \u2282 fk (D).\n1+\u01eb\nThis implies that sD (zk ) \u2265 (sD (a) \u2212 \u01eb)/(1 + \u01eb). Let \u01eb tends to 0, we get\nB n (0,\n\nlim inf sD (zk ) \u2265 sD (a).\nk\u2192\u221e\n\nLet KD (*, *) be the Kobayashi distance on D. It is known that KD is continuous\non D \u00d7 D (see e.g. [9]). So we have KD (zk , a) \u2192 0 as k \u2192 \u221e. By Theorem 2.1, for\neach k, there exists a holomorphic embedding fk : D \u2192 B n such that fk (zk ) = 0\nand B n (0, sD (zk )) \u2282 fk (D). By the decreasing property of Kobayashi distances\n(see e.g. [9]), we have\nKB n (fk (zk ), fk (a)) = KB n (0, fk (a)) \u2264 KD (zk , a)\nfor all k. So KB n (0, fk (a)) \u2192 0, which implies that fk (a) tends to 0 in the ordinary\ntopology (see [4]). So, for any positive number \u01eb, there exists an integer M such\nthat ||fk (a)|| < \u01eb for k > M . This implies\nsD (a) \u2265\n\nsD (zk ) \u2212 \u01eb\n,\n1+\u01eb\n\nso we have\nsD (a) \u2265 lim sup\nk\u2192\u221e\n\nsD (zk ) \u2212 \u01eb\n.\n1+\u01eb\n\nLetting \u01eb tends to 0, we get\nsD (a) \u2265 lim sup sD (zk ).\nk\u2192\u221e\n\nSo limk\u2192\u221e sD (zk ) = sD (a), namely sD is continuous at a. Note that a is arbitrary,\nso sD is continuous on D.\n\u0003\n\n\fON SOME PROPERTIES OF SQUEEZING FUNCTIONS OF BOUNDED DOMAINS\n\nFor r \u2208 [0, 1), we define\n\n7\n\n1+r\n.\n1\u2212r\nIt is clear that \u03c3(c) is strictly increasing for 0 \u2264 c < 1, its inverse is given by\n\u03c3 \u22121 (w) = tanh(w/2). For a point z \u2208 B n , the Kobayashi distance form 0 to z is\n\u03c3(|z|). For two nonnegative numbers u and v, it is not difficult to prove that\n\u03c3(r) = log\n\n\u03c3 \u22121 (u + v) \u2264 \u03c3 \u22121 (u) + \u03c3 \u22121 (v).\n\nLet D be a bounded domain in Cn , we define a function T (*, *) on D \u00d7 D as\nT (x, y) = \u03c3 \u22121 (KD (x, y))\n\nthen the above properties of \u03c3 implies that T (*, *) is a metric on D. Since KD\ninduces the ordinary topology of D, so does T . From the proof of Theorem 3.1, one\ncan directly get the following\nTheorem 3.2. The squeezing function sD of D is Lipschitz continuous with respect\nto the metric T . In fact, we have\n|sD (x) \u2212 sD (y)| \u2264 2T (x, y), x, y \u2208 D.\nRemark 3.1. The same result as in the above theorem still holds if we replace\nKobayashi distance in the definition of T (*, *) by Carath\u00e9odory distance.\nBy Theorem 3.1, we directly get the following result proved in [21]:\nCorollary 3.3. Let D be a bounded domain that covers a compact complex manifold, then D is a holomorphic homogeneous regular domain.\nProof. Let X be a compact complex manifold that is covered by D. By the holomorphic invariance of squeezing functions, sD (z) can be pushed down to a function\non X. By Theorem 3.1, sD (z) is continuous. Note that sD (z) is also positive, it\nmust attain a positive lower bound on X, and hence on D.\n\u0003\n4. Relations between intrinsic metrics and squeezing functions\nThe main purpose of this section is to investigate relations between squeezing\nfunctions and some intrinsic metrics on bounded domains. We give a boundary estimate of the Carath\u00e9odory metric of a bounded planar domain in term of boundary\nbehavior of its squeezing function. In fact, similar but weaker form of this result still\nholds in higher dimensional case. We then focus on bounded holomorphic homogeneous regular domains, and prove that the Carath\u00e9odory metric, the Kobayashi\nmetric and the Bergman metric on these domains are complete. As a result, a\nholomorphic homogeneous regular domain must be pseudoconvex.\nWe first need the following lemma, which is known as Koebe's one-quarter theorem in classical complex analysis.\nLemma 4.1. (see e.g. [2]) Let \u2206 \u2282 C be the unit disc. Let g be a univalent\nholomorphic function on \u2206 such that g(0) = 0 and g \u2032 (0) = 1. Then \u22061/4 := {z \u2208\nC; |z| < 1/4} \u2282 g(\u2206).\nWith this lemma, we now prove the following\nTheorem 4.2. Let D be a bounded domain in C, x \u2208 D. Then the Carath\u00e9odory\n\u2202\nat x is not less than sD (x)/4\u03b4(x), where z is the standard\npseudo-norm of \u2202z\n\u2202\ncoordinate on C and \u2202z\nis viewed as a vector in the tangent space Tx D of D at x.\n\n\f8\n\nFUSHENG DENG, QIAN GUAN, AND LIYOU ZHANG\n\nProof. By Theorem 2.1, there exists a univalent map f : D \u2192 \u2206 such that f (x) = 0\nand \u2206sD (x) \u2282 f (D), where \u2206sD (x) is the disc in C with center 0 and radius sD (x).\nWe want to estimate the module |f \u2032 (x)| of the derivative of f at x. Let\ng = f \u22121 |\u2206sD (x) ,\n\nit is a univalent map form \u2206sD (x) to D such that g(0) = x.\nNow we define a univalent map \u03c6 : \u2206 \u2192 C by setting\n\u03c6(z) =\n\ng(sD (x) * z) \u2212 x\n,\nsD (x) * g \u2032 (0)\n\nthen it is clear that \u03c6(0) = 0 and \u03c6\u2032 (0) = 1. By Lemma 4.1, we have \u22061/4 \u2282 \u03c6(\u2206).\nThis implies that\n\u2206(x, sD (x)|g \u2032 (0)|/4) \u2282 g(\u2206sD (x) ) \u2282 D,\n\nwhere, for a \u2208 C and r > 0, we set \u2206(a, r) the disc in C with center a and radius\nr. In particular, we have\n\u03b4(x) \u2265 sD (x)|g \u2032 (0)|/4.\nNote that f \u2032 (x) = 1/g \u2032 (0), we get\n\n|f \u2032 (x)| \u2265\n\nsD (x)\n.\n4\u03b4(x)\n\nThis means that the Carath\u00e9odory pseudo-norm of\n\n\u2202\n\u2202z\n\nat x is not less than sD (x)/4\u03b4(x).\n\u0003\n\nRemark 4.1. Using similar argument as in the proof of Theorem 4.2, one can prove\na weaker form of Theorem 4.2 in higher dimensional cases. In fact, for a bounded\ndomain D \u2282 Cn , one can prove that the Carath\u00e9odory pseudo-norm k X kCD on\nD of X \u2208 Tx D = Cn admits the estimate\nk X kCD \u2265\n\nsD (x) k X k\n,\n4\u03b4(x, X)\n\nwhere \u03b4(x, X) is the boundary distance of x with respect to the direction X, and\nk X k is the Euclidean norm of X.\nA corollary of theorem4.2 is the following\nTheorem 4.3. Let D be a bounded domain in C satisfying\nsD (x) > C/log(1/\u03b4(x))\nfor some positive constant C and all x \u2208 D with \u03b4(x) < 1, then the Carath\u00e9odory\nmetric on D is complete.\n\u2202\nat x is\nProof. By Theorem 4.2, we see that the Carath\u00e9odory pseudo-norm of \u2202z\n\u2212C\nnot less than \u03b4(x)log\u03b4(x) , which implies the completeness of the Carath\u00e9dory metric\non D.\n\u0003\n\nWe focus on holomorphic homogeneous regular domains in the rest of this section. We first prove the completeness of the Carath\u00e9odory metric of a holomorphic\nhomogeneous regular domain.\nTheorem 4.4. Let D be a holomorphic homogeneous regular domain in Cn . Then\nthe Carath\u00e9odory metric on D is complete.\n\n\fON SOME PROPERTIES OF SQUEEZING FUNCTIONS OF BOUNDED DOMAINS\n\n9\n\nProof. Since D is a bounded domain, the Carath\u00e9odory metric on D is nondegenerate. Denote by CD (*, *) the Carath\u00e9odory distance on D.\nLet c > 0 be a positive lower bound of the squeezing function sD of D. We first\nprove that, for any x0 \u2208 D, the set\nA(x0 ) := {x \u2208 D; CD (x, x0 ) < log(\n\n1 + c/2\n)}\n1 \u2212 c/2\n\nis relatively compact in D. By theorem2.1, there exists an open holomorphic embedding fx0 : D \u2192 B n such that fx0 (x0 ) = 0 and B n (0, c) \u2282 fx0 (D). By the\ndecreasing property of Carath\u00e9odory metrics, we have\nfx\u22170 CB n \u2264 CD\n\nthis implies that\n\nfx0 (A(x0 )) \u2282 {z \u2208 B n ; CB n (z, 0) < log(\nNote that the set\n{z \u2208 B n ; CB n (z, 0) < log(\n\n1 + c/2\n)}.\n1 \u2212 c/2\n\n1 + c/2\n)} = {z \u2208 B n ; ||z|| < c/2}\n1 \u2212 c/2\n\nis relatively compact in B n (0, c), so A(x0 ) is relatively compact in D.\nFor bounded domains, it is known that the topology induced by the Carath\u00e9odory\nmetric coincides with the ordinary topology(see e.g. [8]). In particular, a compact\nset of D with the ordinary topology is also compact with respect to the topology induced by the Carath\u00e9odory metric. By the above result, we see that the\nCarath\u00e9odory metric on D is complete.\n\u0003\nIt is known that a domain whose Carath\u00e9odory metric is complete must be\npseudoconvex (see e.g. [8]), as a consequence of Theorem 4.4, we have the following\nresult, which was proved in [21] by different method:\nCorollary 4.5. A holomorphic homogeneous regular domain must be pseudoconvex.\nFor any complex manifold, it is well known that its Carath\u00e9odory pseudo-metric\nis always dominated by its Kobayashi pseudo-metric (see e.g. [9]). For bounded\ndomains, a famous result of Lu in [16] says that the Carath\u00e9odory metric is always\ndominated by the Bergman metric. Note also that, for a bounded domain D, any\none of the three intrinsic metrics- the Carath\u00e9odory metric, the Kobayashi metric,\nand the Bergman metric- induces the same topology as the ordinary one. Therefore,\nas a consequence of Theorem 4.4, we have the following\nTheorem 4.6. Let D be a holomorphic homogeneous regular domain. Then the\nKobayashi metric and the Bergman metric on it are complete.\n5. Squeezing functions on planar domains\nIn this section, we will consider squeezing functions on planar domains. For\nfinitely connected planar domains, we get a neat description of the boundary behavior of their squeezing functions. As a result, we get the necessary and sufficient\ncondition for such a domain to be a holomorphic homogeneous regular domain. If\nD has smooth boundary, then\nlim sD (z) = 1.\n\nz\u2192\u2202D\n\n\f10\n\nFUSHENG DENG, QIAN GUAN, AND LIYOU ZHANG\n\nBy continuity of sD , this implies D is a holomorphic homogeneous regular domain.\nAs a consequence, we can recover some important results about planar domains, for\nexample, the three intrinsic metrics-the Carath\u00e9odory metric, the Kobayashi metric,\nand the Bergman metric-on a bounded planar domain with smooth boundary are\nall complete, and they are equivalent; all smoothly bounded planar domains are\nhyperconvex , i.e., they admit bounded exhaustive subharmonic functions. We\nalso give a class of holomorphic homogeneous regular domains which are infinitely\nconnected.\nIt is clear that the squeezing function of the unit disc is the constant function with\nvalue 1. By Riemann mapping theorem and holomorphic invariance of squeezing\nfunctions, the squeezing function of any simply connected bounded planar domain\nis also constant with value 1.\nNow we consider squeezing functions on 2-connected planar domains. Define\nAr = {z \u2208 C; r < |z| < 1}\nfor 0 \u2264 r < 1. When r > 0, we call Ar an annulus. It is well-known that a\n2-connected domain in C which is not conformal equivalent to C\u2217 must be holomorphic equivalent to a unique Ar (see e.g. [1]). When r = 0, A0 is just the\npunctured disc \u2206\u2217 , and we will consider it in the last section. For Ar with r > 0,\nwe have the following\nTheorem 5.1. For r > 0, the squeezing function sAr (z) tends to 1 as z \u2192 \u2202Ar .\nIn particular, Ar is a holomorphic homogeneous regular domain.\nProof. For c \u2208 [0, 1), we define\n\u03c3(c) = log\n\n1+c\n.\n1\u2212c\n\nIt is clear that \u03c3(c) is strictly increasing for 0 \u2264 c < 1, its inverse is given by\n\u03c3 \u22121 (w) = tanh(w/2). For a point z \u2208 \u2206, the Poincar\u00e9 distance form 0 to z is\n\u03c3(|z|).\nNow let z \u2208 Ar , with respect to the Poincar\u00e9 metric on \u2206, the distance from z to\nthe cycle {w; |w| = r} is \u03c3(|z|) \u2212 \u03c3(r). Denote by P (z, \u03c3(|z|) \u2212 \u03c3(r)) the disc (w.r.t\nthe Poincar\u00e9 metric on \u2206) with center z and radius \u03c3(|z|) \u2212 \u03c3(r), then we have\nP (z, \u03c3(|z|) \u2212 \u03c3(r)) \u2282 Ar . Choose a conformal map f : \u2206 \u2192 \u2206 such that f (z) = 0.\nSince f preserves the Poincar\u00e9 metric on \u2206, it maps P (z, \u03c3(|z|) \u2212 \u03c3(r)) onto the\ndisc (w.r.t the Poincar\u00e9 metric on \u2206) with center f (z) = 0 and radius \u03c3(|z|) \u2212 \u03c3(r),\nwhich is just the Euclidean disc with center 0 and radius \u03c3 \u22121 (\u03c3(|z|) \u2212 \u03c3(r)). This\nimplies that\n\u22121\n\nsAr (z) \u2265 \u03c3 \u22121 (\u03c3(|z|) \u2212 \u03c3(r)).\n\n(2)\n\nNote that \u03c3 (\u03c3(|z|) \u2212 \u03c3(r)) \u2192 1 as |z| \u2192 1, so sAr (z) tends to 1 as |z| \u2192 1.\nConsider the holomorphic automorphism of Ar given by z 7\u2192 r/z, by the conformal\ninvariance of sAr , we also get sAr (z) tends to 1 as |z| \u2192 r.\nBy Theorem 3.1, sAr is continuous and hence has a positive lower bound, so Ar\nis a holomorphic homogeneous regular domain.\n\u0003\nBy similar argument, Theorem 5.1 can be generalized to finitely connected planar\ndomains as follows:\n\n\fON SOME PROPERTIES OF SQUEEZING FUNCTIONS OF BOUNDED DOMAINS\n\n11\n\nTheorem 5.2. Let D be a domain in C, assume that C\u0304 \u2212 D has finitely many\nconnected components such that each connected component is not a single point.\nThen we have\nlim sD (z) = 1.\nz\u2192\u2202D\n\nIn particular, D is a holomorphic homogeneous regular domain.\nProof. We define the function \u03c3 as in the proof of Theorem 5.1. Let E1 , * * * , En\nbe connected components of C\u0304 \u2212 D . Then D1 := C\u0304 \u2212 E1 is simply connected and\nD \u2282 D1 . Since E1 is not a single point, by Riemann mapping theorem, there is a\nconformal map \u03c61 from D1 to \u2206. It is clear that \u03c61 (D) is a domain in \u2206 obtained\nby deleting n \u2212 1 connected compact subsets, say L2 , * * * , Ln , from \u2206.\nLet z \u2208 D and let lz = P\u2206 (z, \u222ani=2 Li ) be the distance from z to \u222ani=2 Li with\nrespect to the Poincare distance of \u2206. Choose a conformal map f : \u2206 \u2192 \u2206 such\nthat f (z) = 0, then the Euclidean disc with center 0 and radius \u03c3 \u22121 (lz ) is contained\nin f (\u03c6(D)), which implies that s\u03c6(D) (z) \u2265 \u03c3 \u22121 (lz ). If |z| tends to 1, then lz tends\nto \u221e and \u03c3 \u22121 (lz ) tends to 1, hence s\u03c6(D) (z) tends to 1. By holomorphic invariance\nof squeezing functions, we see that\nlim sD (z) = 1.\n\nz\u2192E1\n\nSimilarly, for Ei with 2 \u2264 i \u2264 n, we also have\nlim sD (z) = 1.\n\nz\u2192Ei\n\nHence\nlim sD (z) = 1.\n\nz\u2192\u2202D\n\nBy continuity of sD , it admits a positive lower bound on D, so D is a holomorphic\nhomogeneous regular domain.\n\u0003\nUsing Riemann mapping theorem, one can prove that the domains considered in\nthe above theorem are holomorphic equivalent to bounded domains with smooth\nboundary(see e.g. [1]). Hence an equivalent version of the above theorem is the\nfollowing:\nTheorem 5.3. Let D be a bounded domain in C with smooth boundary. Then we\nhave\nlim sD (z) = 1\nz\u2192\u2202D\n\nIn particular, D is a holomorphic homogeneous regular domain.\nRemark 5.1. As a consequence of Theorem 5.3, for a bounded planar domain D with\nsmooth boundary, sD can be extended continuously to D\u0304. It may be interesting to\ninvestigate whether the same result holds in higher dimensions.\nIn section 3, we have shown that the Carath\u00e9odory metric, the Kobayashi metric, and the Bergman metric on a holomorphic homogeneous regular domain are\ncomplete. As mentioned in the introduction, these intrinsic metrics on a holomorphic homogeneous regular domain are equivalent [14]. It is also turned out that\nany holomorphic homogeneous regular domain is hyperconvex [21]. So, as a result\nof Theorem 5.3, we can recover the following results in complex analysis:\n\n\f12\n\nFUSHENG DENG, QIAN GUAN, AND LIYOU ZHANG\n\nTheorem 5.4. Let D be a planar domain with smooth boundary, then we have:\n(1) The Carath\u00e9odory metric, the Kobayashi metric and the Bergman metric on D\nare complete;\n(2) The Carath\u00e9odory metric , the Kobayashi metric and the Bergman metric on\nD are equivalent.\n(3) D is hyperconvex.\nBy definition, it is clear that the product of two holomorphic homogeneous regular domains is again a holomorphic homogeneous regular domain. So we get\nCorollary 5.5. Let D be a bounded domain in Cn which is holomorphic equivalent to the product of bounded planar domains with smooth boundary, then D is a\nholomorphic homogeneous regular domain.\nAs mentioned in the introduction, the list of known holomorphic homogeneous\nregular domains contains bounded homogeneous domains , Teichm\u00fcller spaces,\nbounded domains covering compact K\u00e4hler manifolds and strictly convex domains\nwith C 2 -boundary. Many examples of holomorphic homogeneous regular domains\ngiven by Corollary 5.5 are not in the list . More precisely, we have the following\nProposition 5.6. Let D1 , * * * , Dk be bounded planar domains with smooth boundaries which are mutually not conformal equivalent. If there exists a Di which is\nnot conformal equivalent to the unit disc \u2206, then the domain D := D1r1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Dkrk\nis a holomorphic homogeneous regular domain which is not holomorphic equivalent\nto any of the domains in the above list. Where r1 , * * * , rk are positive integers and\nDiri = Di \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Di is the ri -power of Di .\nProof. Denote by Aut(D) the holomorphic automorphism group of D. By the\nproposition in [19] and Theorem 1 in [20], we have\nAut(D) = Aut(D1r1 ) \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Aut(Dkrk ),\n\nand, for each i, the following sequence is exact:\n\n1 \u2192 (Aut(Di ))ri \u2192 Aut(Diri ) \u2192 Sri \u2192 1,\n\nwhere Sri is the symmetry group of degree ri which acts on Diri by permutation.\nThe decomposition of Aut(D) implies that D is homogeneous if and only if each\nfactor Di is homogeneous, and D can cover a compact complex manifold is and only\nif so does for each Di . Note that a smoothly bounded planar domain is homogeneous\nor can cover a compact complex manifold if and only if it is isomorphic to \u2206, hence\nD can not be homogeneous or cover a compact complex manifold.\nIt is clear that D can not be holomorphic equivalent to any convex domain\nsince the fundamental group of D is nontrivial. By the same reason, D is not\nholomorphic equivalent to any Teichm\u00fcller space since it is well known that all\nTeichm\u00fcller spaces are contractible.\n\u0003\nFor general finitely connected planar domains, the boundary behavior of their\nsqueezing functions can be described as follows:\nTheorem 5.7. Let D be a finitely connected planar domain, let E be a connected\ncomponent of C\u0304 \u2212 D:\n(1) if E is not a single point, then\nlim sD (z) = 1;\n\nD\u220bz\u2192E\n\n\fON SOME PROPERTIES OF SQUEEZING FUNCTIONS OF BOUNDED DOMAINS\n\n13\n\n(2) if E = {p} contains a single point, then\n\nsD (z) \u2264 \u03c3 \u22121 (KD\u0303 (z, p)), z \u2208 D,\n\nwhere \u03c3 is defined as in the proof of Theorem 5.1 and KD\u0303 (*, *) is the Kobayashi\ndistance on the domain D\u0303 := D \u222a {p}. In particular,\nlim sD (z) = 0.\n\nD\u220bz\u2192p\n\nProof. The proof of (1) is similar to the proof of Theorem 5.2 and we will not repeat\nit here. Now we give the proof of (2). Let z \u2208 D, and fz : D \u2192 \u2206 be a holomorphic\nembedding such that fz (z) = 0. Note that D\u0303 is a domain. By Riemann's removable\nsingularity theorem, fz can be extended as a holomorphic map f \u0303z form D\u0303 to \u2206. It\nis clear that f \u0303z (p) 6\u2208 f (D). By the decreasing property of Kobayashi distances, we\nhave K\u2206 (0, f \u0303z (p)) \u2264 KD\u0303 (z, p), hence sD (z) \u2264 \u03c3 \u22121 (KD\u0303 (z, p)).\n\u0003\nRemark 5.2. Theorem 5.7 implies that a finitely connected planar domain is a\nholomorphic homogeneous regular domain if and only if each connected component\nof its complement in C\u0304 is not a single point.\nThe examples of planar holomorphic homogeneous regular domains given by\nTheorem 5.2 are all finitely connected, i.e, their complement in C\u0304 have finitely\nmany connected components. We can also construct a class of planar holomorphic\nhomogeneous regular domains which are infinitely connected.\nLet Aut(\u2206) be the holomorphic automorphism group of \u2206, and denote by \u2206r\nthe disc in C with center 0 and radius r and \u2206r its closure. We first prove the\nfollowing lemma:\nLemma 5.8. For any positive numbers u, v and w with u < v < w < 1, there\nexists a positive number c(u, v, w) such that: for an arbitrary positive number r\nwith u < r < v, let D \u2282 Ar be a domain containing \u2206w \\ \u2206r , then, for z \u2208 \u2206v \\ \u2206r ,\nwe have sD (z) \u2265 c(u, v, w).\nProof. Consider the reflection R : D \u2192 \u2206 given by\nz 7\u2192 r/z,\nIt is clear that z \u2208 R(D) provided r/w < |z| < 1. For z \u2208 \u2206v \\ \u2206r , we have\nr/v < |R(z)| < 1,\nhence the disc (with respect to the Poincare metric) with center z and radius\n\u03c3(r/v) \u2212 \u03c3(r/w) is contained in R(D). So we see that\nsR(D) (R(z)) < \u03c3 \u22121 (\u03c3(r/v) \u2212 \u03c3(r/w))\n\nfor z \u2208 \u2206v \\ \u2206r . By the biholomorphic invariance of squeezing functions, we get\nsD (z) \u2265 \u03c3 \u22121 (\u03c3(r/v) \u2212 \u03c3(r/w))\n\nfor z \u2208 \u2206v \\ \u2206r . Take\n\nc(u, v, w) = inf {\u03c3 \u22121 (\u03c3(r/v) \u2212 \u03c3(r/w))},\nu\u2264r\u2264v\n\nit is clear that c(u, v, w) > 0 and it satisfies the condition of the lemma.\nBy the above lemma, we can prove the following\n\n\u0003\n\n\f14\n\nFUSHENG DENG, QIAN GUAN, AND LIYOU ZHANG\n\nTheorem 5.9. Let u, v and w be positive numbers with u < v < w < 1, let rk ,\nk = 1, 2, * * * , be a sequence of positive numbers satisfying u < rk < v. Let fk be a\nsequence in Aut(\u2206) such that fk (\u2206w ) are pairwise disjoint. Then the domain\nD = \u2206 \\ (\u222a\u221e\nk=1 fk (\u2206rk ))\nis a holomorphic homogeneous regular domain.\nProof. Let c(u, v, w) as in Lemma 5.8, denote c(u, v+w\n2 , w) by c. By the above\nlemma and biholomorphic invariance of squeezing functions, we have sD (z) \u2265 c for\n\u0011\n\u0010\nz \u2208 D\u2032 := D \u2229 \u222a\u221e\nk=1 fk (\u2206 v+w ) .\n2\n\n\u2032\n\nFor z \u2208 D \\ D , the distance form z to \u2202D with respect to the Poincare distance\non \u2206 is greater than \u03c3( v+w\n2 ) \u2212 \u03c3(v). Take a conformal map f \u2208 Aut(\u2206) such that\nf (z) = 0, we see that sD (z) \u2265 \u03c3 \u22121 (\u03c3( v+w\n2 ) \u2212 \u03c3(v)). So sD has a positive lower\nbound and hence D is a holomorphic homogeneous regular domain.\n\u0003\nAs a consequence, the Carath\u00e9odory metrics, the Kobayashi metrics, and the\nBergman metrics on domains that are constructed in Theorem 5.9 are complete,\nand they are equivalent. An explicit example can be constructed as follows: take\nf \u2208 Aut(\u2206) defined by\nz + 1/2\nf (z) =\n1 + z/2\nk\nand let D = \u2206 \\ (\u222a\u221e\nk=\u2212\u221e f (\u22061/4 )), then D is a holomorphic homogeneous regular\ndomain, and the Carathodory metric, the Kobayashi metric, and the Bergman\nmetric on D are complete and equivalent. The special domain D was constructed in\n[10] to show that a bounded planar domain may have infinite discrete automorphism\ngroup.\n\n6. Squeezing functions on annuli\nIn the above section, we have studied some properties of squeezing functions of\nannuli. In this section, we want to investigate further properties of them.\nWe have seen that all annuli are holomorphic homogeneous regular domains, and\ntheir squeezing functions tend to 1 at the boundary. An interesting but difficult\nproblem is to give an exact expression of sAr . Another relatively simple problem is\nto determine the minimum of sAr for r > 0, which are conformal invariants.\nBy the conformal invariance of sAr , sAr (z) depends only on |z|, so sAr is reduced\nto a function defined\n\u221a reduced\n\u221a on (r, 1). Be the reflection z 7\u2192 r/z, it can be further\nto a function on [ r, 1). We show that sAr (x) is strictly increasing on [ r, 1). To\nprove this result, we first prove two propositions, which are also interesting in their\nown right.\nLet D \u2282 C be a bounded domain with smooth boundary, denote by HD the set\nof univalent maps f form D to \u2206 such that \u2206 \\ f (D) is a compact set. For bounded\nplanar domain D, we always denote by PD (*, *) the Poincare distance of D.\nProposition 6.1. Let D \u2282 C be a bounded domain with smooth boundary. Then,\nfor any p \u2208 D, we have\nsD (p) = sup{r|\u2206r \u2282 f (D) f orsome f \u2208 HD with f (p) = 0}.\n\n\fON SOME PROPERTIES OF SQUEEZING FUNCTIONS OF BOUNDED DOMAINS\n\n15\n\nProof. Let f : D \u2192 \u2206 be a univalent map with f (p) = 0 and assume \u2206r \u2282\nf (D). Let D\u2032 be the union of f (D) and the compact connected components of\n\u2206 \\ f (D). Then D\u2032 is simply connected. By the Riemann mapping theorem, there\nis a conformal map g : D\u2032 \u2192 \u2206 with g(0) = 0.\nNote that\n\u2206r = {z \u2208 \u2206|P\u2206 (z, 0) < \u03c3(r)},\nby the decreasing property of the Poincare metrics on planar domains, we have\nP\u2206 (z, w) \u2264 PD\u2032 (z, w) for all z, w \u2208 D\u2032 , so\n{z \u2208 D\u2032 |PD\u2032 (z, 0) < \u03c3(r)} \u2282 \u2206r .\n\nNote that g is an isometry form (D\u2032 , PD\u2032 ) to (\u2206, P\u2206 ). Hence\n\u2206r = {z \u2208 \u2206|P\u2206 (z, 0) < \u03c3(r)} = g({z \u2208 D\u2032 |PD\u2032 (z, 0) < \u03c3(r)}) \u2282 g(f (D)).\n\nNow we get a univalent map g \u25e6 f : D \u2192 \u2206 with g \u25e6 f \u2208 HD , g \u25e6 f (p) = 0 and\n\u2206r \u2282 g \u25e6 f (D). Since f is arbitrary, we see that\nsD (p) = sup{r|\u2206r \u2282 h(D) f or some h \u2208 HD with h(p) = 0}.\n\n\u0003\nFor two subsets A and B of \u2206, we denote by P\u2206 (A, B) the distance between A\nand B with respect to the Poincare distance of \u2206.\nProposition 6.2. Let D \u2282 C be a bounded domain with smooth boundary. For\np \u2208 D. Let\nu(p) = sup{P\u2206 (f (p), \u2206 \\ f (D))|f \u2208 HD },\nthen we have sD (p) = \u03c3 \u22121 (u(p)).\nProof. For p \u2208 D and f \u2208 HD , let\n\nu = P\u2206 (f (p), \u2206 \\ f (D)).\n\nThen the P\u2206 -disc with center f (p) and radius u is contained in f (D). Take a\nconformal map g : \u2206 \u2192 \u2206 such that g(f (p)) = 0, then we have \u2206\u03c3\u22121 (u) \u2282 g \u25e6 f (D).\nSo we have sD (p) \u2265 \u03c3 \u22121 (u). Since f \u2208 HD is arbitrary, we have sD (p) \u2265 \u03c3 \u22121 (u(p)).\nOn the other hand, for an arbitrary f \u2208 HD with f (p) = 0, let r be the positive\nnumber such that \u2206r \u2208 f (D) but \u2206r+\u01eb * f (D) for any \u01eb > 0. It is clear that\nr = \u03c3 \u22121 (P\u2206 (f (p), \u2206 \\ f (D))) \u2264 \u03c3 \u22121 (u(p)).\n\nSince f \u2208 HD is arbitrary, by the above proposition, we have sD (p) \u2264 \u03c3 \u22121 (u(p)).\n\u0003\n\u221a\nTheorem 6.3. Viewed as a\u221afunction on [ r, 1), the squeezing function sAr\u221a\n(z) of\nAr is strictly increasing on [ r, 1); in particular, it attains its minimum at r.\n\u221a\nProof. For simplicity, let s = sAr . For x \u2208 [ r, 1), by Theorem2.1, there is a\nunivalent map f : D \u2192 \u2206 such that f (x) = 0 and \u2206s(x) \u2282 f (D). By Proposition6.1,\nwe may assume f \u2208 HD . By proposition6.2, we have s(x) = \u03c3 \u22121 (P\u2206 (f (x), \u2206 \\\nf (D))). By proposition6.2 and the conformal invariance of s, we have the identity\nP\u2206 (f (x), \u2206 \\ f (D)) = sup{P\u2206 (f (z), \u2206 \\ f (D))|z \u2208 D, |z| = x}.\n\u221a\nNote that the curve f (|z| = r) separates C into two connected parts, let\u221a U\nand V be the bounded and unbounded connected components of C \\ f (|z| = r)\nrespectively.\n\n\f16\n\nFUSHENG DENG, QIAN GUAN, AND LIYOU ZHANG\n\n\u221a\nIf x > r, then f (|z| = x) \u2282 V . In fact, if it is not the case, then composing f\nwith the reflection z 7\u2192 r/z will lead to a contradiction to the extremal property\nassumption on f . \u221a\nNow let x\u2032 \u2208 [ r, 1) with x\u2032 > x, then it is clear that f (|z| = x\u2032 ) lies in the\nunbounded component of C \\ f (|z| = x), so we have\nsup{P\u2206(f (z), \u2206 \\ f (D))|z \u2208 D, |z| = x\u2032 } > sup{P\u2206 (f (z), \u2206 \\ f (D))|z \u2208 D, |z| = x}\n\nby proposition6.2, there is a point z \u2208 Ar with |z| = x\u2032 and sAr (z) > s(x). Note\n\u0003\nthat sAr (z) = s(|z|) = s(x\u2032 ), hence s(x\u2032 ) > s(x).\n\u221a\nTheorem 6.3 and its proof lead us to conjecture that, for \u03c1 \u2208 [ r, 1), sAr (\u03c1) is\ngiven by\n\u0013\n\u0012\n(1 + \u03c1)(1 \u2212 r)\n,\nsAr (\u03c1) = \u03c3 \u22121 (\u03c3(\u03c1) \u2212 \u03c3(r)) = \u03c3 \u22121 log\n(1 \u2212 \u03c1)(1 + r)\nwhere the function \u03c3 is defined as in the proof of Theorem 5.1. Provided this\nconjecture, Theorem 6.3 implies that sAr (\u03c1) attains its minimum\n\u221a\n\u221a\n1+ r\nsAr ( r) = tanh log \u221a\n1+r\n\u221a\nat \u03c1 = r, which characterizes the conformal structure of Ar .\n7. Explicit form of squeezing functions on some special domains\nIn this section, we give the explicit form of squeezing functions on some special\ndomains, namely punctured balls and classical bounded symmetric domains.\nWe first consider domains constructed by deleting analytic subsets from other\ndomains.\nTheorem 7.1. Let D\u2032 \u2282 Cn be a bounded domain and A \u2282 D\u2032 be a proper analytic\nsubset. Then, for the domain D = D\u2032 \\ A, one has\nsD (z) \u2264 \u03c3 \u22121 (KD\u2032 (z, A)), z \u2208 D\n\nwhere \u03c3 is defined as in the proof of Theorem 5.1 and KD\u2032 (*, *) is the Kobayashi\ndistance on D\u2032 ; in particular, we have limz\u2192z0 sD (z) = 0.\nProof. Let z \u2208 D, and fz : D \u2192 B n be a holomorphic open embedding such that\nfz (z) = 0. By Riemann's removable singularity theorem, fz can be extended to a\nholomorphic map f \u0303z form D\u2032 to B n . It is clear that f \u0303z (D) \u2229 f \u0303z (A) = \u2205. By the\ndecreasing property of Kobayashi distance, we have KB n (0, f \u0303z (A)) \u2264 KD\u2032 (z, A),\nhence sD (z) \u2264 \u03c3 \u22121 (KD\u2032 (z, A)), z \u2208 D.\n\u0003\nRemark 7.1. The domains D constructed in the above theorem are not holomorphic\nhomogeneous regular domains. The conclusion can also be derived from Corollary\n4.5 since D is not pseudoconvex, or from Theorem 4.4 since the Carath\u00e9odory\nmetric on D, which is just the restriction of that of D\u2032 , is not complete.\nFor the special case of punctured balls, Theorem 7.1 implies the following\nCorollary 7.2. The squeezing function sB n \\{0} on the n dimensional punctured\nball B n \\ {0} is given by\nsB n \\{0} (z) =k z k\nwhere k z k is the Euclidean norm of z.\n\n\fON SOME PROPERTIES OF SQUEEZING FUNCTIONS OF BOUNDED DOMAINS\n\n17\n\nProof. By theorem7.1, we have sB n \\{0} (z) \u2264k z k. On the other hand, it is clear\nthat sB n \\{0} (z) \u2265k z k. Hence sB n \\{0} (z) =k z k.\n\u0003\nOther examples of bounded domains whose squeezing functions can be given explicitly are classical symmetric bounded domains. Recall that a classical symmetric\ndomain is a domain of one of the following four types:\nDI (r, s) = {Z = (zjk ) : I \u2212 Z Z\u0304 \u2032 > 0, where Z is an r \u00d7 s matrix} (r \u2264 s),\n\nDII (p) = {Z = (zjk ) : I \u2212 Z Z\u0304 \u2032 > 0, where Z is a symmetric matrix of order p},\n\nDIII (q) = {Z = (zjk ) : I \u2212 Z Z\u0304 \u2032 > 0, where Z is a skew-symmetric matrix of order q},\n\nDIV (n) = {z = (z1 , * * * , zn ) \u2208 Cn : 1 + |zz \u2032 |2 \u2212 2zz \u2032 > 0, 1 \u2212 |zz \u2032| > 0}.\n\nHere I is the identity matrix of proper order, Z\u0304 denotes the conjugate matrix of Z\nand Z \u2032 the transposed matrix of Z. The complex dimensions of these four domains\nare rs, p(p + 1)/2, q(q \u2212 1)/2 and n respectively.\nFor a bounded homogeneous domain D, by the holomorphic invariance of squeezing functions, sD is a constant function on D, and we denote this constant by s(D).\nBy a theorem of Kubota, which is based on an earlier work of Alexander [3], the\nsqueezing functions on the above four types of domains can be given explicitly as\nfollows:\nTheorem 7.3. (see Theorem 1 in [12])\ns(DI (r, s)) = r\u22121/2 ,\ns(DII (p)) = p\u22121/2 ,\ns(DIII (q)) = [q/2]\u22121/2 ,\ns(DIV (n)) = 2\u22121/2 ,\nwhere [q/2] denotes the integral part of q/2.\nFor products of classical symmetric domains, we have:\nTheorem 7.4. (see Theorem 2 in [12]) If D1 , * * * , Dm are classical symmetric\ndomains, then\ns(D1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Dm ) = (s(D1 )\u22122 + * * * + s(Dm )\u22122 )\u22121/2 .\nRemark 7.2. In the 1980s, Y. Kubota considered the following Carath\u00e9odory extremal problem [11, 12, 13]:\nM (z0 , D) =\n\nsup |JF (z0 )|\n\nF \u2208F(D)\n\n(z0 \u2208 D),\n\n(3)\n\nwhere D is a bounded domain in the complex Euclidean space Cn and F(D) consists\nof all holomorphic mappings from D into the unit ball B n in Cn , and JF is the\nJacobian of F .\nHe proved that the extremal mapping of the extremal problem (3) is unique up to\na unitary linear transformation when D is a bounded symmetric domain(including\ntwo exceptional cases) [13]. We observe that the extremal mappings are exact the\nextremal embedding from bounded symmetric domains into the unit ball. Take\nDI (r, s) here for example,\nwe can find from Kubota's proof that the extremal map\u221a\nping is f (z) = z/ r, z = (z11 , * * * , z1s , z21 , * * * , zrs ) \u2208 Crs , which is exact an\n\n\f18\n\nFUSHENG DENG, QIAN GUAN, AND LIYOU ZHANG\n\nextremal embedding\nthe squeezing function s(DI (r, s)) = r\u22121/2 since one knows\n\u221a for\nn\nBn \u2282 DI (r, s) \u2282 rB , (n = rs).\nWhen D is a complex ellipsoid in Cn , i.e.\nn\nX\n\b\n|zj |kj < 1 ,\nD = D(k1 , * * * , kn ) = z \u2208 Cn :\nj=1\n\nwhere kj (j = 1, 2, * * * , n) are positive real numbers, Ma considered the extremal\nproblem (3) in 1997 [17]. It is proved that the extremal mapping is again linear,\nand we conjecture it is likely the extremal embedding for squeezing function sD (z)\nin this case. Therefore, it will be interesting to consider relations in general between\nsqueezing function sD on a bounded domain D and the Carath\u00e9odory maps from\nD into the unit ball, especially when D is homeomorphic to a cell.\nReferences\n[1] L.V.
