INTRODUCTION\n\nFeibig et al.1 have discussed the conditions for second harmonic generation proportional\nto the Time-reversal breaking order parameter for the case of magnetoelectric symmetry2 ,\ni.e. for the case that Time-reversal Symmetry R is broken and so is Inversion I but their\nproduct RI is preserved. Following earlier suggestions3,4 , ARPES experiments with circularly\npolarized photons5 have detected such a phase in the so-called pseudogap phase in the phase\ndiagram of a high temperature superconducting compound of the Copper-Oxide (Cu-O)\nfamily. Time-reversal is broken due to circulating currents in specific patterns within the\nunit cell with translational symmetry preserved. If this discovery is correct, it togather with\nthe extensive evidence for Quantum Critical properties in the normal phase6 around the\ndoping- density for the highest Tc implies that the basic framework for the theory of the\nCuprates is in place. It is therefore very important to verify the discovery by independent\nexperiments. Accordingly, we work out here the symmetry considerations for magnetoelectric induced second harmonic generation in the Cuprates.\nMany terms in the multipole susceptibility contributes to the second harmonic generation (SHG). The relevant contributions for the processes discussed here come from the\nmagnetic-dipole, Mk (2\u03c9) \u221d \u03c7m\nijk (\u03c9, \u03c9, 2\u03c9)Ei (\u03c9)Ej (\u03c9), and the electric-dipole, Ek (2\u03c9) \u221d\ne\n\u03c7ijk (\u03c9, \u03c9, 2\u03c9)Ei(\u03c9)Ej (\u03c9). While the former is generally present in the symmetry of the\ncuprate compounds, the latter occurs in the predicted pseudogap phase with \u03c7eijk transforming as an odd tensor under time-reversal. The intereference effects due to the simultaneous\ne\npresence of the two-time-reversal odd tensors \u03c7m\nijk and \u03c7ijk are responsible for the effects\ndiscussed here.\nII. SYMMETRY OF THE NORMAL PHASE\n\nMost Cu \u2212 O compounds possess a centre of symmetry in the unit-cell. We consider\nthe body-centered tetragonal crystals with symmetry group 4/mmm(D4h ), denoting the\npresence of a four-fold axis and a mirror plane orthogonal to this axis and two other mirror\nplanes or orthorhombic crystals with symmetry group mmm (D2h ), (three orthogonal mirror\nplanes only). Due to the centre of inversion, the third rank polar tensor \u03c7eijk arising from\nelectric- dipole effects is zero but the third rank axial tensor \u03c7m\nijk arising from magnetic-dipole\neffects is non-zero. In other words a term in the Free-energy \u03a6 of the form\n\u03a6 = \u03c7m\nijk Ei Ej Hk\n\n(1)\n\nexists. Correspondingly a magnetization for applied electric fields\nMk = \u03c7m\nijk Ei Ej\n\n(2)\n\nis non-zero.\nWe specify the tensors in this paper using the following co-ordinates: The c axis of\nthe crystal coincides with the \u1e91 direction, a and b crystalline axis (those along the nearest\n\u221a\n\u221a\nneighbor Cu-Cu vector) are along the (x\u0302+ \u0177)/ 2 and (x\u0302\u2212 \u0177)/ 2 directions. For the 4/mmm\n7\ngroup, three independent components of \u03c7m\nijk are non-zero . The vector M takes the form:\n2\n\n\f\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\u2212\u03c7m\n1 Ey Ez\n\uf8f8\nM = \uf8ed \u03c7m\n1 Ez Ex\n0\n\n(3)\n\nm\nm\n\u03c7m\n1 \u2261 (\u03c7xzy + \u03c7zxy )\n\n(4)\n\nFor the mmm group, six independent elements of \u03c7m\nijk exist and all three cartesian\n\u2032\ncomponents of M are bilinear in E s. We present detailed results for the 4/mmm crystalline\nsymmetry. Very similar conclusions hold for the mmm crystalline symmetry.\nIII. TIME-REVERSAL BREAKING STATE\n\nTwo different phases breaking time-reversal are shown to be possible in the pseudogap\nphase (3 ,4 ). The current patterns in these phases in the Cu-O planes are shown in Fig. (1).\nOne called the \u0398II phase has the symmetry mmm (Fig. 1 b). This group is in the\nMagnetoelectric class, where both time-reversal (R) and inversion (I) are broken but their\nproduct is preserved. The other possible phase \u0398I (Fig. 1 a) preserves inversion while\nbreaking Time-reversal. It has the symmetry 4/mmm. So the effects discussed here do not\noccur in such a phase.\nAs will be clear from Fig. (1 b), the point group mmm has the following elements: the\nidentity, two-fold axis rotation around \u0177 (Cy ), the reflections in the x \u2212 y and y \u2212 z planes\n(\u03c3z and \u03c3x ), RI, R\u03c3y , RCx and RCz .\nIn the group mmm, axial tensors of third rank which are invariant under time-reversal\nm,(i)\n\u03c7ijk are allowed7 . The independent components of M are\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8f6\n\u03c7m\nx Ey Ez\n\uf8f8.\nM = \uf8ed \u03c7m\ny Ex Ez\nm\n\u03c7z Ex Ey\n\n(5)\n\nm\nm\nwhere \u03c7m\njki + \u03c7kji = \u03c7i and i, j, k run over x, y, z. But more importantly, polar-tensors of\ne(c)\nodd-rank \u03c7ijk , which change sign under time-reversal are also allowed. So a Polarization\nvector of the form\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\ne(c)\n\u03c71 Ex Ey\n\uf8ec\ne(c) 2\ne(c) 2 \uf8f7\n2\n(6)\nP = \uf8ed \u03c7e(c)\nzzy Ez + \u03c7xxy Ex + \u03c7yyy Ey \uf8f8\ne(c)\n\u03c72 Ez Ey\ne(c)\n\ne(c)\n\ne(c)\n\ne(c)\n\ne(c)\n\ne(c)\n\nis allowed. Here \u03c71 = \u03c7yxx + \u03c7xyx and \u03c72 = \u03c7yzz + \u03c7zyz . These \u03c7\u2032 s are expected to be\nproportional to the order parameter \u0398II .\nFrom these we can construct the relevant part of the Poynting vector S:\nS=\n\n\u2202M\n\u22022P\n+\u2207\u00d7\n2\n\u2202t\n\u2202t\n\n3\n\n(7)\n\n\fFIGURES\n\na)\n\nO\n\nO\n\nO\n\nCu\n\nO\n\nb)\nO\n\nO\n\nCu\n\nCu\n\nO\n\nO\n\nO\n\nO\n\nCu\n\nO\n\nCu\n\nO\n\nO\n\nO\n\nO\n\nO\n\nO\n\nO\n\nO\n\nO\n\nCu\n\nO\n\nCu\n\nO\n\nCu\n\nO\n\nO\n\nFIG. 1. Current patterns for the time-reversal breaking states proposed in Ref.3,4 .\n\nThe SHG intensity is I \u221d |S|2 . As shown below, interesting effects arise in experimental\ngeometries in which both \u03c7e(c) and \u03c7m are used and interfere. Then effects linear in the\nmagnetoelectric order parameter are observable. If light is propogated in the sample along\nany of the axes, \u2207 \u00d7 M = 0. Then only the electric-dipole susceptibility contributes to the\nSHG and I \u221d |\u03c7e |2 which is in turn proportional only to the square of the order parameter.\nWe fix the axes with respect to the crystal as in Fig. (2). For an arbitrary direction\nof incidence, Figure 2 shows the triad form by the propagation vector q (specified by the\npolar angle \u03b8 and the azimuthal angle \u03c6), and the components of the polarization along the\northogonal directions \u00eaxy in the x-y plane and \u00eaqz in the q-z plane. To maximize the second\nterm in Eq. (7) we chose a polar incidence angle \u03b8 = \u03c0/4.\n\n4\n\n\feqz\n(c)\n\nz\n\ne xy\nq\n\nq\n(a+b) x\n\ny (a-b)\n\nf\n\nFIG. 2.

Its sign is changed on reversing the polarization of\nthe light or by reversing time (i.e. by reversing the domains or reversing the direction of\npropagation for a fixed domain i.e. changing \u03c6 to \u03c0 + \u03c6). For cos \u03c6 = \u00b11, that is when q\nbelongs to the broken symmetry plane \u0177, the difference between both circular polarization\nis maximized.

In all the states there is a contribution to the\nSHG coming from the magnetic-dipole terms but the electric-dipole contribution appears\nonly when the inversion and time-reversal are broken with their product preserved, as in the\n\u0398II phase. The interference of these two terms produce linear terms in both \u03c7m and \u03c7e and\ntherefore proportional to the order parameter. This term change sign reversing the domains\n\u0398II to \u2212\u0398II or changing the direction of incident light by the operation q \u2192 \u03c3x \u03c3y q (which\nhas the effect of changing\u03c6 to \u03c6 + \u03c0). The interference term also changes sign on changing\nfrom left to right circularly polarized light.\nThe presence of many different \u0398II domains within the spot size of the incident beam\nwill blur this effect. ARPES experiments5 indicate domains to be of O(100 microns).\nThe proposed experiment are a rather thorough test of the symmetries of the predicted\nphase because they rely on broken R and \u03c3y (or \u03c3x )) but their product preserved below\nthe pseudogap temperature in the cuprates. Breaking reflection symmetry alone would not\nproduce the predicted effects in Second-harmonic generation, while the ARPES experiment5\nis in principle compatible4 with breaking some reflection symmetries alone. Some other\nexperiments using resonant x-ray absorption and diffraction have also been proposed (8 ).\nAcknowledgments: We wish to thank Professor Harry Tom for discussion of the feasibility of experiments and Professor J.
