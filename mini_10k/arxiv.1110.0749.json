To ensure\na high heat-to-electrical power conversion efficiency, the\nthermal conductances of the materials used for thermoelectric modules (TEM) have, in principle, to be as low\nas possible[1]. Fu et al [2] recently reported on an electrothermal process that can modify the effective thermopower of semiconductor devices. In particular, they\nclaimed that the joint application of a temperature gradient and an electric field (perpendicular to each other)\nto a bipolar semiconductor structure induces steady current vortices (even in open circuit configuration) which in\nturn yield Joule heating whose effect is to lower thermal\nconductivity. It is thus worthwhile to check whether this\neffect may be used to improve the so-called figure of merit\nZT of bipolar semiconductor structures to a significant\ndegree.\nThe theoretical prediction of Fu et al [2] that internal current vortices formed at a pn junction provide a\nway to reduce thermal conductivity in practical devices\ndeserves closer inspection. In this Brief Report, using a\nmacroscopic description of a two-leg TEM, we demonstrate that an internal current also gives rise to advective\nthermal transport which, unfortunately for practical applications, largely compensates the effect proposed by Fu\net al [2] and hence effectively lowers ZT . Studying the\nsimple case of two thermoelectric modules connected in\nparallel both thermally and electrically, we suggest that\ninternal currents caused by a temperature gradient are\nnot directly linked to the transverse electrical field as\nsupposed in Ref. [2] but rather caused by thermoelectric\ninhomogeneities inside the materials.\nTo gain insight into the main features of internal current loops, let us consider two thermoelectric modules\nTEM1 and TEM2 , and the equivalent module, denoted\n\n\u2217\n\nyann.apertet@u-psud.fr\n\nFIG. 1. Coupled thermoelectric modules (top) and equivalent\nmodule (bottom).\n\nTEMeq , resulting from their association in parallel, both\nelectrically and thermally as shown in Fig. 1. Each of\nthem is characterized by its isothermal electrical conductance Gi , its thermal conductance under open electrical circuit condition K0,i and its Seebeck coefficient \u03b1i ,\nwhere i can be 1,2 or eq as appropriate. All these coefficients are supposed constant. The whole system is\nsubjected to a temperature difference \u2206T = Thot \u2212 Tcold,\nand its average temperature is T .\nUsing linear response theory we can express each electrical current Ii and thermal flux IQi as functions of generalized forces related to the temperature difference \u2206T\nand voltage difference \u2206V to which the TEM is subjected. The potential differences \u2206V and \u2206T are the\nsame for TEM1 and TEM2 and hence for TEMeq by con-\n\n\f2\nstruction. The relation between the fluxes and the forces\nis given by [3]:\n\u0012\n\nIi\nIQi\n\n\u0013\n\n= Gi\n\n\u0012\n\n1\n\u03b1i T\n\n\u03b1i\n\u03b12i T + K0,i /Gi\n\n\u0013\u0012\n\n\u2206V\n\u2206T\n\n\u0013\n\n, (1)\n\nfrom which we obtain a quite simple expression of the\nthermal flux:\nIQi = \u03b1i T Ii + K0,i \u2206T,\n\n(2)\n\nThis equation shows that two distinct processes contribute to the thermal transport: one is linked to thermal\nconduction by both phonons and electrons when there is\nno current flowing inside the structure (term in K0 \u2206T ),\nthe other to electrical current flow (term in \u03b1T I). Since\nthis second contribution is associated with a macroscopic\ndisplacement of electrons it can be stated to be thermal\ntransport by electronic advection; and the heat quantity\ntransported by each electron [4] is given by |\u03b1|T e, e being\nthe elementary electric charge. This notion of electronic\nadvection is central to explain the increase of thermal\nconductance when an internal current develops inside the\nstructure. We stress that the additional term should not\nbe confused with the electronic part of K0 , which is used,\nfor example, in the Wiedemann-Franz law. On Fig. 1,\nthis is shown with the added thermal conductance parameterized by the electrical current.\nBesides constitutive laws for each module given by\nEq. (1), there are additionnal relations linked to the parallel configuration that must be accounted for. First, we\nensure electrical current conservation:\n\nThis equation is the same as the one given by Hicks\nand Dresselhaus (Eq. (2) of Ref. [5]) for a semiconductor with two conduction bands. The correspondence between both is explained by the fact that each conduction\nband can be associated with a medium where electrons\nflow parallelly. From this result we see that the effective\nSeebeck effect cannot exceed the larger one of the two\nmaterials.\nThe equivalent thermal conductance is now determined\nunder open circuit condition, Ieq = 0. For nonzero values\nof I1 and I2 , this condition is satisfied for I1 = \u2212I2 ; since\nthe conservation of the thermal flux (4) remains valid, we\nobtain:\n\nK0,eq =\n\n(\u03b11 \u2212 \u03b12 )T I1\n+ K0,1 + K0,2 ,\n\u2206T\n\nusing Eq. (2). To proceed, we determine the intensity I1\nas follows. Under open ciruit condition Ieq = 0 so that\nthe voltage reads \u2206V = \u2212\u03b1eq \u2206T , which we include in\nthe expression of I1 given by (1) to obtain:\n\nI1 =\n\nG1 G2\n(\u03b11 \u2212 \u03b12 )\u2206T\nG1 + G2\n\n(3)\n\nNext, we consider that the mean thermal flux flowing\nthrough TEMeq is the sum of the two mean thermal\nfluxes flowing through TEM1 and TEM2 ; hence\nIQeq = IQ1 + IQ2\n\n(4)\n\nNow using Eqs. (1), (3) and (4) we are free choose the\nthermal and electrical configurations which permits an\neasy derivation of the equivalent parameters of the system as a whole. Under isothermal condition, \u2206T = 0,\nand Eq. (3) leads to:\nGeq = G1 + G2 ,\n\nG1 \u03b11 + G2 \u03b12\n,\nG1 + G2\n\nG1 G2\n(\u03b11 \u2212 \u03b12 )2 T\nG1 + G2\n\n(9)\n\nThe above formula exibits an additional term next to\nthe sum of the thermal conductance of each module.\nThis term is related to the internal current that develops inside the structure when sumitted to a temperature\ngradient. This current is proportional to the difference\nbetween the Seebeck coefficients of each leg. The total\ntransported heat by this current is proportionnal to this\ndifference too, so the increase in thermal conductance is\nproportionnal to (\u03b11 \u2212 \u03b12 )2 .\nAs an internal current is generated, energy dissipation\nis caused by Joule effect. The total dissipated power is\ngiven by the sum of the power dissipated in each part\n2\nof the whole system: PJoule = Iint\n(1/G1 + 1/G2 ), where\nIint (\u2261 I1 ) is given by Eq. (8); an explicit expression is,\n\n(5)\n\nUnder closed circuit condition, \u2206V = 0, and Eq. (3)\nleads to Geq \u03b1eq = G1 \u03b11 + G2 \u03b12 , so that the equivalent\nthermopower \u03b1eq is defined as the weighted average of\nthe two Seebeck coefficients \u03b11 and \u03b12 :\n\u03b1eq =\n\n(8)\n\nThis equation shows that there is a non-zero electrical\ncurrent flowing as long as the two Seebeck coefficients\nare different. Now, the substitution of the obtained expression of I1 into Eq. (7), yields the equivalent thermal\nconductance at zero current:\n\nK0,eq = K0,1 + K0,2 +\nIeq = I1 + I2\n\n(7)\n\n(6)\n\nPJoule =\n\nG1 G2\n(\u03b11 \u2212 \u03b12 )2 \u2206T 2 .\nG1 + G2\n\n(10)\n\nThe dependence on the square of the difference of the\nSeebeck coefficients of the modules shows that the more\nthey are dissimilar in terms of thermopower the more\nJoule dissipation is important. Here, there is no need to\nassume, as one would for the classical generator with two\n\n\f3\nlegs, that each module has a different doping type. We\nalso note that the internal current is stronger for materials with high electrical conductance, hence metals are\nmore sensitive to small inhomogeneities in the Seebeck\ncoefficient. This explains why this effect is exploited in\nnon-destructive testing to probe metallic inclusions in a\nhost metal [6\u20138].\nLet us remark that for inclusions at the nanoscale the\nprevious statement about the increase of the thermal conductance no longer stands since these inclusions have a\nstrong impact on thermal conduction by phonons. For\nexample Kim et al [9] demonstrated that nanoinclusions\nare efficient to lower the thermal conductivity in InGaAs.\nWe now turn to the analysis of the paper of Fu et al [2]\nusing our Eq. (9), which allows to explain the behavior\nof a pn junction submitted to a transverse thermal gradient under open circuit condition. A typical Pisarenko\nplot [10], i.e. the Seebeck coefficient plotted against the\ncarrier concentration, shows that the Seebeck coefficient\nis higher for low carrier density. In a pn junction a depleted zone forms and develops on each side of the interface over a few hundreds of nanometers depending on\nthe doping concentration: in these two regions, the Seebeck coefficients increase locally and thus become greater\nthan those in the quasi-neutral regions. Since the carrier\nconcentration inhomogeneity is transverse to the applied\ntemperature gradient, this situation is similar to the simple one studied in the present paper and we can expect\ninternal current vortices to develop as described in [2].\nWe believe that the electric field present in the space\ncharge zone is a consequence of the carrier depletion and\nis not a cause per se of the internal current generation:\nin a structure where one can tune the Seebeck coefficient\nwithout changing the carrier density we expect to find\nthe same behavior. However, for the particular case of\na pn junction the Seebeck inhomogeneity and the transverse electric field are closely connected through the carrier depletion zone; therefore linking, in this case, the\ninternal current either to thermoelectric inhomogeneties\nor to a transverse electric field essentially amounts to express two viewpoints on the same phenomenon. Besides,\nthe appearence of two vortices, one on each side of the\njunction, is due to the potentiel barrier arising at the interfaces: each type of carrier is confined in its own side\nso that these two separate systems have no influence on\neach other except when one of the sides becomes thinner\nthan the depleted zone.\nWe state further that a decrease of the thermal conductance is not possible in such circumstance: Fu and\nco-workers [2] overlooked the advective part of the thermal flux. According to these authors, the reduction is\ndue to the fact that half of the energy dissipated by the\nJoule effect is actually going back to the hot side. This\nheat quantity sould be compared to the one transported\nby electronic heat advection: the ratio between these two\nquantities scales as \u2206T /2T . In the framework of linear\ntheory, the temperature difference \u2206T is assumed to be\n\nsmall, so the heat flowing back to the hot reservoir is\nsmall compared to the advection part: internal currents\nincrease the thermal conductance; they do not decrease\nit. Generation of internal currents in spatially inhomogeneous systems such as multilayer structures were discussed twenty years ago by Saleh et al [11]; our analysis\nis consistent with their conclusions.\nThe specific case of TEMs with both electrical and\nthermal parallel configurations satisfies Bergman's theorem, which states that the figure of merit ZT of a composite material cannot be greater than the larger ZT of\nthe consituents [12]. We have shown that the Seebeck coefficient is lower than the larger one of the two, Eq. (6).\nThe effective electrical conductance of two conductances\nin parallel is always greater than the larger one, but,\nsince ZT \u221d G/K0 for a give temperature T , this increase is counterbalanced by the fact the thermal conductances behave similarly when no internal current develops. Moreover, considering a TEM designed with components that have different Seebeck coefficients, the increase\nin equivalent thermal conductance is even stronger. So,\nas expressed by Bergman and Levy [12], the figure of\nmerit of the TEMeq can only be lower than the highest\nZT of the more efficient TEM. Indeed, the addition of\nan internal current can only lower the figure of merit,\nsince it adds a dissipative process to the system. A full\ngeneralization of this result to composite materials necessitates the derivation of an expression of the effective\nSeebeck coefficient for a configuration where TEMs are\nboth thermally and electrically in series. Since a composite system may be viewed as a network of TEMs a\ngeneral formulation can, in principle, be obtained; however we anticipate that such derivation, which is beyond\nthe scope of the present Brief Report, can be quite tricky.\nThe simple example given in the present paper suffices\nto gain insight into the problem of internal currents and\ntheir properties.\nTo end this Brief Report, we make two additional remarks:\nAssuming that the properties of the thermoelectric\nmodules are temperature-dependent, it would be interesting to check if it is possible to create instabilities inside the module analogous to the Rayleigh-B\u00e9nard convection phenomenon which occurs in conventional fluids\nsubjected to a thermal gradient.\nThe present work and the cited ones on current\nloops bring us back to the original interpretation of the\nthermoelectric effect made by Seebeck who thought that\nthe temperature difference led to magnetism whereas it\nwas the internal current of the structure that created the\nmagnetic field, which deviated the compass needle [13].\nAcknowledgments This work is part of the CERES\n2 and ISIS projects funded by the Agence Nationale\nde la Recherche.
