Equivalently, E has the DPP if, for all\nweakly null sequences (xn ) \u2282 E and (\u03c6n ) \u2282 E \u2217 (the dual of E), we have lim \u03c6n (xn ) =\n0. If E \u2217 has the DPP, then so does E, but the converse is not true [25]. A Banach\nspace with the Schur property has the DPP. The DPP is inherited by complemented\nsubspaces. For more on the DPP, the reader is referred to [8, 6].\nIt was unknown for many years if the Dunford-Pettis property of E and F implies\nb \u03c0 F and of their injective tensor product\nthat of their projective tensor product E \u2297\nb\nE \u2297\u01eb F [8].

Then (E \u2297\n\nThroughout, E and F will denote Banach spaces, en denotes, as usual, the vector\n(0, . . . , 0, 1, 0 . . . ) with 1 in the n th place. We shall use the following notation for\nsome subspaces of L(E, F ): K(E, F ) for the space of compact operators, N (E, F )\nfor the nuclear operators and I(E, F ) for the integral operators. The nuclear norm\nof an operator T is denoted by kT knuc , while kT kint stands for the integral norm.\nGiven an operator T \u2208 L(E, F ), its adjoint is denoted by T \u2217 \u2208 L(F \u2217, E \u2217 ). By\nE \u2243 F we mean that E and F are isomorphic.\nThe Banach-Mazur distance d(E, F ) between two isomorphic Banach spaces E\nand F is defined by inf (kT kkT \u22121k) where the infimum is taken over all isomorphisms\nT from E onto F . Recall that a Banach space E is an L\u221e -space (resp. L1 -space)\n[2] if there is \u03bb \u2265 1 such that every finite dimensional subspace of E is contained\nin another subspace N with d (N, ln\u221e ) \u2264 \u03bb (resp. d (N, ln1 ) \u2264 \u03bb) for some integer n.\nThe L\u221e -spaces, the L1 -spaces and all their dual spaces have the DPP [2, Corollary\n1.30].\nSince some of our results and examples are on L\u221e and L1 -spaces, we shall first\nrecall a well known result on tensor products of these spaces. Observe that it provides\nexamples of tensor products with the DPP.\nProposition 1.

[1] Assume L(E, F \u2217) = Lcc (E, F \u2217 ), and take a weakly null sequence\n(xn ) \u2282 E and a bounded sequence (yn ) \u2282 F . Then the sequence (xn \u2297 yn ) is weakly\nb \u03c0F .\nnull in E \u2297\nThe following result is essentially contained in [1]:\n\nTheorem 3. Suppose E does not have the Schur property, F contains a copy of l1 ,\nb \u03c0 F does not have the DPP.\nand L(E, F \u2217) = Lcc (E, F \u2217 ). Then E \u2297\n\nProof. Since E does not have the Schur property, we can find a normalized\nweakly null sequence (xn ) \u2282 E that may be supposed to be basic. Let (\u03c6n ) \u2282 E \u2217\nbe a bounded sequence with \u03c6i (xj ) = \u03b4ij .\nSince F contains a copy of l1 , there is a surjective operator q : F \u2192 l2 [21,\nb \u03c0 F \u2192 l2 given by\nProposition 3]. Consider the operator T : E \u2297\nT (x \u2297 y) := (\u03c6k (x)hq(y), ek i)\u221e\nk=1 .\n\n\fTHE DUNFORD-PETTIS PROPERTY ON TENSOR PRODUCTS\n\n3\n\nSince\nkT (x \u2297 y)k \u2264 sup k\u03c6k k * kqk * kxk * kyk ,\nk\n\nT is a well defined weakly compact operator. Choose a bounded sequence (yn ) \u2282 F\nso that q(yn ) = en . Then\nT (xn \u2297 yn ) = (\u03c6k (xn )hq(yn ), ek i)\u221e\nk=1 = en .\nb \u03c0 F fails the DPP.\nSo, by Lemma 2, T is not completely continuous, and E \u2297\n\n\u2737\n\nIf we replace the condition \"F contains a copy of l1 \" by the more general \"F\nhas a quotient isomorphic to lp (1 < p < \u221e)\", the proof still works. However, the\nTheorem does not gain in extension. Indeed, we can assume that F has the DPP.\nThen, if F has a quotient isomorphic to lp (1 < p < \u221e), it must contain a copy of\nl1 . This is also true for Theorems 9 and 10.\nTheorem 3 applies, for instance, if E is an L\u221e -space without the Schur property and F is an L\u221e -space containing a copy of l1 : for the equality L(E, F \u2217) =\nLcc (E, F \u2217 ), see [10, Theorem 3.7].\nWe now give another interesting example. Let T be the unit circle with its normalized Lebesgue measure; let H 1 denote the closed subspace of L1 = L1 (T) spanned\nby the functions {eint : n \u2265 0}. Although L1 /H 1 contains an isomorphic copy of\nL1 , every operator L1 /H 1 \u2192 L1 is completely continuous [4]. Let E = L1 /H 1 and\nF = L\u221e [0, 1]. We know that F \u2217 may be written as L1 (\u03bc) for some measure \u03bc. Given\nan operator T : E \u2192 F \u2217 \u2261 L1 (\u03bc), since T (E) is separable, T (E) is isomorphic to\na subspace of L1 [0, 1] [16, Theorem IV.1.7]. Therefore, T is completely continuous.\nb \u03c0 L\u221e [0, 1] does not have the DPP, alApplying Theorem 3, we have that L1 /H 1 \u2297\n1\n\u221e\nb \u03c0 L [0, 1] does have it [3]. Note also that L1 /H 1 \u2297\nb \u03c0 L1 (\u03bc) has the\nthough L [0, 1]\u2297\nDPP for all \u03bc [23].\nRemark 4. Theorem 3 does not include Talagrand's example [26] of a space E with\nb \u03c0 E fails the DPP.\nthe Schur property such that L1 ([0, 1], E) = L1 [0, 1]\u2297\n\nIndeed, Theorem 3 cannot be applied to the space L1 [0, 1], since we have the\nfollowing facts:\n(a) If L(L1 [0, 1], F \u2217 ) = Lcc (L1 [0, 1], F \u2217), then F contains no copy of l1 .\n(b) If L(E, L1 [0, 1]\u2217 ) = Lcc (E, L1 [0, 1]\u2217), then E has the Schur property.\nFor (a), suppose F has a subspace M \u2243 l1 . Then F \u2217 /M \u22a5 \u2243 l\u221e contains a\ncopy of L1 [0, 1]. If T : L1 [0, 1] \u2192 F \u2217 /M \u22a5 is an isomorphism, then we can write\nT = Q \u25e6 S [15, Proposition 1], where Q : F \u2217 \u2192 F \u2217 /M \u22a5 is the quotient map.\nTherefore, S : L1 [0, 1] \u2192 F \u2217 is not completely continuous.\nTo prove (b), take a normalized weakly null, basic sequence (xn ) \u2282 E, and a\nbounded sequence (\u03c6n ) \u2282 E \u2217 with \u03c6i (xj ) = \u03b4ij . Since L1 [0, 1]\u2217 is isomorphic to l\u221e ,\nthe mapping\nx \u2208 E 7\u2212\u2192 (\u03c6n (x))\u221e\nn=1 \u2208 l\u221e\n1\n\u2217\nprovides an operator E \u2192 L [0, 1] which is not completely continuous.\n\n\f4\n\nM. GONZ\u00c1LEZ AND J. M. GUTI\u00c9RREZ\n\nb \u03c0 F has the\nCorollary 5. Assume E, F are infinite dimensional L\u221e -spaces, and E \u2297\n\u2217\n\u2217\nDPP. Then, either E and F have the Schur property or E and F have the Schur\nproperty.\nProof. Observe first that L(E, F \u2217 ) = Lcc (E, F \u2217) [10, Theorem 3.7].
