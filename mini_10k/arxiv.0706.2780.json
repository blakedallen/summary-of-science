Introduction\nThis is the fifth paper of the spectroscopic part of the\nBologna Open Cluster Chemical Evolution (BOCCE)\nproject (see Bragaglia & Tosi 2006, Carretta et al. 2004,\n2005), aimed at deriving with the best attainable homogeneity reddening, age and metallicity for a sample of old\nOCs in order to define the metallicity distribution in the\ndisk and its (possible) evolution with time. We concentrate here on the two very metal rich clusters NGC 6253\nSend offprint requests to: E. Carretta\n\u22c6\nBased on observations made at ESO telescopes under\nprogrammes 67.D-0018, 169.D-0473 and with the Italian\nTelescopio Nazionale Galileo (TNG) operated on the island\nof La Palma by the Fundaci\u00f3n Galileo Galilei of the INAF\n(Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica) at the Spanish Observatorio\ndel Roque de los Muchachos of the Instituto de Astrofisica de\nCanarias\n\nand NGC 6791, and present a first detailed abundance\nanalysis based on high S/N, high resolution spectra of red\nclump stars in NGC 6253 and the follow-up of the work\nin Gratton et al. (2006, hereafter G06) on NGC 6791.\nWe selected the cluster NGC 6253 as relevant in determining the presence and slope of the disk radial abundance gradient since it is one of the known OC with\nsmaller galactocentric distance and its metallicity is very\nhigh. We have recently re-analyzed (Bragaglia & Tosi\n2006) the cluster photometric data with updated evolutionary tracks and confirmed the findings in Bragaglia et\nal. (1997). From comparison of synthetic CMDs to the observed ones, NGC 6253 has RGC = 6.6 kpc, Z=0.05 and\nage=3 Gyr. Other papers on this cluster were published\nby Piatti et al. (1998) and Sagar et al.

(2000)\nand Sestito et al. (2007) based on high resolution spectroscopy. The high metallicity of NGC 6791 has been acknowledged for some time (e.g., Peterson & Green 1998\nand Chaboyer et al. 1999, based on spectroscopy and photometry, respectively) and has been confirmed by several\nvery recent works: our own paper (G06, high resolution optical spectroscopy), Carraro et al. (2006, high resolution\noptical spectroscopy), Origlia et al. (2006, high resolution\ninfrared spectroscopy) and Anthony-Twarog et al. (2007,\nStr\u00f6mgren photometry). More details on these works will\nbe presented in Section 5.\nCool stars, like the ones studied here, and high metal\nabundance conspire to produce very crowded spectra that\nare better examined by spectrum synthesis than with the\nclassical abundance analysis based on equivalent widths,\neven at the quite high resolution of the FEROS and UVES\nspectra, R\u224345000, considered in the present paper. The\npresent analysis is hence done in the same way as the one\nfor NGC 6791 (G06), i.e. employing extensive synthesis of\nselected features.\nThe paper is organized as follows: the data are described in Sect. 2, metallicity determination is discussed\nin Sect. 3, while abundances of other elements are presented in Sect. 4 for NGC 6253 and for NGC 6791. Sect.\n5 presents a comparison to literature data on these two\nOCs and field stars; a discussion and summary are given\nin Sect. 6.\n\n2. Observations and data reduction\nNGC 6253: As done for the other clusters of the BOCCE\nsample, our targets in NGC 6253 were chosen among Red\nClump (RC) stars, using the photometry by Bragaglia et\nal. (1997). The targets lie near the cluster centre and their\npositions are shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 2 displays the cluster\nCMD with the five targets indicated by larger symbols.\nIdentifications, celestial coordinates (J2000), photometry\nand details on the observations are presented in Table 1.\nObservations for stars 2508 and 3595 were obtained\nwith FEROS, a high resolution fiber-fed spectrograph at\nthe time mounted on the 1.5m ESO telescope in La Silla,\non 2001 April 25 and 26 (programme 67.D-0018). The\nwavelength range is 3700-8600 \u00c5, at R=48000. Two exposures were obtained for each star and the individual\nspectra were reduced using the data reduction package\ninstalled at the telescope and later summed.

Map of NGC 6253 (5 \u00d7 5 arcmin2 , North up, East\nleft) with the observed stars.\n\n2885, and 4510 were observed using UVES on the ESO\nVLT (Unit 2), on 2002 July 16 and 19 (as a backup during\nprogramme 169.D-0473); a single exposure was obtained\nfor each star. The spectra cover the wavelength ranges\n3560-4840 and 5710-9320 \u00c5, at R=43000. They were reduced with the standard pipeline.\nWe measured radial velocities (RVs) for each individual spectrum using several tens of metallic lines; the resulting heliocentric RVs are listed in Table 1; their errors\nare less than about 1 km s\u22121 .\nNGC 6791: Four RC stars in the very old (about 9 Gyr,\nKing et al. 2005), very metal rich ([Fe/H]= +0.47, according to G06) open cluster NGC 6791 were obtained with\nSARG at the 3.5m Italian telescope Galileo at a slightly\nlower resolution (R\u224330000) and S/N (60 on average) than\nthose considered for NGC 6253. The grating used covers\n\n\fCarretta et al.: NGC 6253 and NGC 6791\n\nFig. 2. V, B \u2212 V CMD of the central region of NGC 6253\n(from Bragaglia et al. 1997), with the observed stars shown\nas larger symbols; circles indicate single, member stars and\nthe square the probable binary (or non member) star.\nthe wavelength range 4595-6170 and 6240-7900 \u00c5; however\nonly the central interval (\u223c5000-6500 \u00c5) was considered\nof good enough quality to be used in the analysis. We recall here that the RC in NGC 6791 is -apparently- much\nfainter than that of NGC 6253, due to the larger distance;\ntypical magnitudes and colours are V \u2243 14.6, B \u2212 V \u2243 1.4\nand V \u2212 K \u2243 3.1. Details on observations and reductions,\ncoordinates and magnitudes, etc. can be found in G06.\n\n3. Abundance analysis\n3.1. Stellar parameters\nThe required atmospheric parameters for the stars in\nNGC 6253 were derived from the photometry. Effective\ntemperatures (Teff ) and surface gravities (log g) were derived from the V \u2212 K colour calibrations for temperature and bolometric corrections by Alonso et al. (1999),\nusing the B, V visual photometry by Bragaglia et al.\n(1997) and the J, K infrared photometry by 2MASS\n(Skrutskie et al. 2006). In the derivation of atmospheric\nparameters we adopted (m \u2212 M )0 = 11.0, E(B \u2212 V )=0.23,\nmass=1.4 M\u2299 from Bragaglia & Tosi (2006). We also assumed [Fe/H]=+0.2 since the latter represents the highmetallicity limit for the Alonso et al. calibration. However,\nthe negligible dependency of the V \u2212K colour on metallicity ensures that we are not committing a significant error\nin the case of the stars of NGC 6253, as also stated by\nAlonso et al. (sect. 2.3), who consider V \u2212 K as the best\ntemperature indicator for giant stars, since an error of 0.5\ndex in metallicity translates in and error of at most 0.7%\nin Teff . The microturbulent velocities (vt ) were computed\nusing the relation with log g presented in Carretta et al.\n\n3\n\nFig. 3. Small fraction of the spectra of the 5 target stars\nin NGC 6253, of the field giant star \u03bc Leo, and of a RC\nstar in NGC 6791; the spectra are offset for clarity. The\narrows point to Fe i lines; the longer ones indicate lines\nused in our synthesis. The Fe line near 6090 \u00c5 for star\n3595 has been excised because of a defect.\n(2004). The resulting atmospheric parameters are listed in\nTable 2.\nWe estimated the error in Teff and log g due to our\nchoice of distance and reddening as follows. The ranges\ncovered in literature for these parameters are rather small:\n(m \u2212 M )0 =11.0\u00b10.25 and E(B \u2212 V )=0.23\u00b10.03. A variation of 0.03 in E(B \u2212 V ) translates into about 70 K when\nTeff is derived by V \u2212 K, while a variation of 0.25 in distance modulus translates into 0.1 dex in log g. These are\nthe major error sources in both these parameters; we do\nnot have any indication of errors larger than those estimated from our abundance analysis (see Sect. 3.2).\nAtmospheric parameters for the four RC star in\nNGC 6791 are taken from G06 (their Table 3) where a detailed description can be found; we report them in Table 2\nfor convenience. They were derived in the same way as in\nNGC 6253, adopting (m\u2212M )V =13.45 and E(B\u2212V )=0.15\n(as average of the literature values) and mass 0.9 M\u2299 (for\nan age of 9 Gyr, e.g., King et al. 2005).\n\n3.2. Errors\nThree kind of errors have to be considered:\nInternal errors (the truly random component), that\nwill show up in star-to-star comparisons;\nGlobal errors (originating e.g., from the adopted atmospheric parameters), that affect all stars in a cluster in the\nsame way;\n\n\f4\n\nCarretta et al.: NGC 6253 and NGC 6791\n\nTable 3.

Hence,\na good check on the accuracy of the internal errors is then\nthe observed star-to-star scatter, or for an individual star\nthe line-to-line scatter.\nGlobal (cluster) errors are the major matter of concern in the BOCCE program, because our goal is to use\n\n\fCarretta et al.: NGC 6253 and NGC 6791\n\n5\n\nFig. 4.

The main problem is the possible degeneracy existing between reddening and metallicity in photometric analyses. However, the cluster metallicity has a dependence on the assumed reddening that is\nexactly the opposite in the case of a CMD and a spectrum.\nIn the first case, the highest the reddening, the most metal\npoor the cluster should be; in the second case the adoption\nof a higher reddening means assuming that the stars are\nwarmer, which leads to a higher metal abundance from\nthe analysis of the spectra. Hence, it is very important\n\nthat results from the analysis of the CMDs are consistent\nwith those obtained from the spectroscopic analysis.\nFinally, we will leave out scale errors for now, not because we believe they are not present, but because they\naffect only at second order the discussion of the results\nin the whole BOCCE program, insofar our assumptions\n(e.g., line lists, model atmospheres, etc) are kept constant\nthroughout our series of papers. This is the main reason\nwe define our procedure as \"homogeneous\". Furthermore,\neven if these stars are not the brightest ones, we decided\nto analyze clump stars because they are not very cool and\nhave a limited range of atmospheric parameters in all old\nopen clusters. We think that this is much safer than observing the brightest cluster stars, that are generally very\ncool, so that concerns on the adequacy of model atmospheres or the impact of non-LTE effects are much more\nsevere.\n\n3.3. Metallicity of NGC 6253 from synthesis of Fe lines\nAs in G06, we used spectrum synthesis on selected iron\nlines (Carretta et al. 2004) to derive the metallicity; we\nconsidered 36 Fe i and 6 Fe ii lines for the analysis (see\nTable 3). Holding fixed the Teff , log g and vt values appropriate for each star, we extracted the corresponding\nmodels from the grid of model atmospheres by Kurucz\n(1993) with the overshooting option switched on; the\nmodel we considered have a solar-scaled mixture of heavy\nelements. We then generated synthetic spectra in a 2 \u00c5 region around each Fe line, by varying the iron abundances\nfrom [Fe/H]=\u22120.2 to +1.0 in steps of 0.2 dex. The [Fe/H]\nvalue most appropriate for each individual line was derived by best fitting (by eye) the synthetic spectrum to\nthe observed one. This procedure allowed us to supersede\n\n\f6\n\nCarretta et al.: NGC 6253 and NGC 6791\n\nthe large uncertainties due to blending and alleviated the\nproblem of correct continuum positioning in spectra of\nrather cool, very metal-rich giant stars. Examples of the\nfitting are given in Fig. 4.\nA detailed description of the line lists used to compute\nthe synthetic spectra is given in both Carretta et al. (2004)\nand G06 and it will not be repeated here. We only remind\nthat line parameters for iron lines (oscillator strengths and\ndamping broadening in particular) are as in Gratton et\nal. (2003); they are the same used in previous studies on\nabundances of old open clusters consistently derived by\nour group.\nIn G06 we adopted an estimate of 0.16 dex for the\nfitting error; this includes random errors due to photometric uncertainties on the line profile and to the estimate of the local continuum level. Using this approach,\nspectrum normalization is obtained by matching \"high\"\npoints in the observed spectrum to corresponding \"high\"\npoints in the synthetic spectrum. These high points do not\nnecessarily have the intensity expected for the local continuum since we are using a very extensive line list tested\non the very high resolution and S/N spectrum of the extremely line-rich K giant HR 3627 (see Carretta et al.\n2004), whose lines are even stronger than in the program\nstars. Some uncertainty in this normalization procedure is\nclearly present; this is what we call \"error in the estimate\nof the local continuum level\". However, the present spectra are of much higher quality than those of NGC 6791,\nand we consider a better estimate for this error the value\nof 0.12 dex, the typical line-to-line rms scatter for the four\nprogram stars.\nResults derived for individual Fe lines are listed in\nTable 3, expressed as abundances by number1 both for\nFe i and Fe ii lines. Average metallicities are summarized\nin Table 4, together with the number of lines used and the\nrms scatter for each star; in this Table, abundances are referred to the solar abundances adopted in Gratton et al.\n(2003): log n(Fe) = 7.54 and 7.49 from neutral and singly\nionized lines, respectively. There is a very small scatter in\nmetallicity and no trend as a function of effective temperature. In Table 4 we also give the metallicity of the four\nstars in NGC 6791 for immediate comparison (from G06,\nTable 3).\nWe do not report here the abundances for star 2508,\nwhose spectrum has an RV differing from the average of\nthe four others by about 10\u03c3 and an abundance lower than\nthe cluster average. This star could be a field interloper,\nnotwithstanding its position on the RC, or a binary. The\nlatter possibility is supported by the different RV we determined in Carretta et al. (2000) for this star (\u221228.5 versus the present \u221220.6 km s\u22121 ), albeit on spectra of worse\nquality and with a probable zero point effect of the order\n1\n\nWe use the usual spectroscopic notation: log n(A) is the\nabundance (by number) of the element A in the usual scale\nwhere log n(H)=12; [A/H] is the logarithmic ratio of the abundances of elements A and H in the star, minus the same quantity in the Sun.\n\nTable 4.

Furthermore, while writing the paper we were informed (S. Desidera and M. Montalto, private communication based on an on-going work on planet\nsearch in NGC 6253) that star 2508 has a 92 % probability of being a cluster member, based on its proper\nmotion. Of course, complete confirmation of binarity will\nrequire the acquisition of a series of spectra in order to\ncheck for RV variations. The lower abundance could be\nexplained by veiling from a secondary component; given\nthe difference in line intensity between star 2508 and the\nother RC cluster stars (about 10 %), the secondary component should roughly provide a fraction of light of about\n0.1, i.e., should be about 2.5 mag fainter, in the observed\nwavelength range. It could then be a main sequence star,\njust below the turn-off point. Its contribution makes the\nprimary appear slightly brighter and bluer than single RC\nstars; taking this into account the primary still has magnitude and colour appropriate for a RC star. Given the\nlarger uncertainties related to the analysis of this star, we\nhave excluded it from further discussion.\nDue to the quite similar procedure we used for both\nclusters (set of line parameters and model atmospheres,\nderivation of atmospheric parameters, spectrum synthesis\ntechnique and package), we adopt the same error budget derived in G06 for NGC 6791 (see their Table 4).\nThe small, not statistically significant, difference [Fe/H]i\n- [Fe/H]ii = \u22120.04 \u00b1 0.05 dex we found between Fe i and\nFe ii would be erased by choosing temperatures about 50\nK higher or gravities 0.15 dex lower than those adopted.\nOn the other hand, the trend of abundances with line excitation is \u2206[Fe/H]/\u2206E.P. = \u22120.013 \u00b1 0.014 dex/eV, on\naverage. Although not significant, this indicates that temperatures should be lowered by 55\u00b159 K in order to match\nthe excitation temperature. The conclusion is that these\nuncertainties are well within those estimated to affect the\nadopted atmospheric parameters.\nIn summary, we derive for NGC 6253 a metal abundance [Fe/H]= +0.46\u00b10.02\u00b10.08, where the first error bar\nrefers to the random part (as estimated from the star-tostar scatter: rms=0.03 dex) and the second term takes into\naccount the systematics due to the assumption of reddening, distance modulus, temperature scale, etc (see Sect.\n3.3 in G06).\n\n\fCarretta et al.: NGC 6253 and NGC 6791\n\nTable 5.

Results for the individual stars in the two\nclusters are presented in Table 7, while Table 8 gives the\naverage values.\nWe have determined the sensitivity of abundances to\nvariations in atmospheric parameters using star 4510 in\nNGC 6253 (see Table 6); given the similarity of evolutionary status and metallicity, these are valid also for the other\nstars in this cluster and in NGC 6791.\n\n4.1. NGC 6253\nC, N, O - For stars of this temperature and metallicity\nthere is coupling between C and O due to the formation\nof CO; furthermore, the O line used (6300.3 \u00c5) is contaminated by lines of the CN red system, meaning that we also\nneed to consider N abundance in our computations. The\nabundances of C, N and O were derived following the classical procedure first described in Lambert & Ries (1978,\n1981). We used the version applied by Gratton & Sneden\n(1990) to \u03bc Leo, solving the full set of dissociation equations related to the coupling of these elements including\namong others the CO and CN molecules.\nBriefly, we obtained a first set of C and O abundances\nby assuming a guess for the N abundance (actually, the\nsolar-scaled [N/Fe] value); the best C and O abundances\nwere obtained from the intersection of the loci in the CO plane derived via synthetic spectrum comparison with\nobserved O and C features.\nThe oxygen abundances were derived from careful synthesis of the [O i] 6300.3 \u00c5 line, the best abundance indicator for red giants in the optical. We did not need to\ncorrect for telluric components the spectra of the stars observed with UVES, since we checked that the oxygen line\nwas not affected by them by comparing to the spectrum of\na rapidly rotating early type star. For star 3595, observed\n\n\f8\n\nCarretta et al.: NGC 6253 and NGC 6791\n\nwith FEROS, the heliocentric correction is very different;\nthe presence of contamination by telluric lines was detected and cleaned up by using the same early type star\nspectrum. The contribution by the Ni i line at 6300.35 \u00c5,\nwhose effect is not negligible in moderately O-poor, metalrich stars in open clusters (see Carretta et al. 2005), was\nduly considered adopting a solar [Ni/Fe] ratio: we included\nthe log gf for this line by Johansson et al. (2003) in the\nlist for synthetic spectra.\nVery good estimates of the C abundances can be obtained from the spectral synthesis of the C2 molecular features at 5086 \u00c5. However, only the spectra obtained with\nFEROS contains this region; hence, the fitting was possible only for star 3595. All the stars in our sample have the\nsame evolutionary status and a quite similar appearance\nof their spectra, so that we should be justified in adopting\na value [C/Fe]= \u22120.20 dex also for the three stars observed with UVES. However, we confirmed the validity of\nthis assumption with synthesis of the CH band near 4300\n\u00c5, present in all spectra. With this C abundance, we derived from the forbidden [O i] line trial values for their O\nabundances.\nWith these preliminary values of the C, O abundances\nwe derived abundances of N from the comparison of synthetic spectra to a number of features of the CN red system, between 8158 and 8224 \u00c52 . We could match 15 to\n24 such features, depending on the star. The averaged N\nvalues, having an rms of 0.10 to 0.16 dex, are shown in\nTable 5 for each individual star. We find on average a\nsmall depletion of N, with [N/Fe]= \u22120.08 (rms=0.03 dex,\nfour stars).\nFinally, with these N values we reiterated the derivation of C and O; however, results were found to be scarcely\nsensitive to the newly derived N abundances, with respect\nto the initial solar-scaled value adopted. In Table 7 we\nsummarize the full set of C, N, O abundances obtained\nwith this procedure.\nThe light elements Na and Al - Since the strong Na doublets at 5682-88 and 8183-8194 \u00c5 are heavily saturated\nand a reliable abundance is difficult to obtain from these\nfeatures even with spectrum synthesis, our Na values for\nNGC 6253 were derived from the weaker doublet at 615460 \u00c5. The latter has the further advantage of smaller departures from the LTE assumption.\nIn Table 7 we list the [Na/Fe] ratios obtained for each\nstar; the corrections for departures from LTE were found\nto be negligible, following the prescription by Gratton et\nal. (1999). As found for the majority of open clusters studied so far, the average Na in NGC 6253 is enhanced relative\nto the solar ratio, with no significant star-to-star scatter\n(average [Na/Fe]=+0.21, rms=0.02 dex).\nAbundance of Al were derived from spectrum synthesis of the doublet at 6696-98 \u00c5. We measured a [Al/Fe]\n2\n\nThis wavelength range was not observed with SARG,\nhence the N abundance for the stars in NGC 6791, derived\nfrom weaker lines at shorter wavelengths, is more uncertain\n\nFig. 5. Comparison of synthetic spectra with the Si i\n6721.85 \u00c5 line for star 2509 in NGC 6253. The observed\nspectrum is plotted as black dots and the three synthetic\nspectra, obtained by changing the Si abundance in 0.2 dex\nsteps, are indicated by thin lines. The C and N abundances\nare those derived for this star and nicely reproduce the\nnearby CN features, supporting the reliability of [C/Fe]\nand [N/Fe] ratios obtained for this star.\n\nslightly lower than solar-scaled (on average [Al/Fe]\u22120.08,\nrms=0.12 dex).\n\u03b1-elements - We measured Mg abundances through spectrum synthesis of the Mg i triplet at 6318-19 \u00c5, and of\nthe line at 7691.5 \u00c5. The Mg lines are all strong and this\ntriplet, although largely used, is not a perfect abundance\nindicator since damping is important and not well known3 .\nWe found a solar scaled ratio; on average [Mg/Fe]=+0.01\n(rms=0.03) dex. Although no significant star-to-star scatter is present, we attribute a larger uncertainty to our\nmeasure for the reason given just above.\nThe Si abundances are based on three lines (six for the\nFEROS spectrum), among them the clean Si i 6721.85 \u00c5\nline that falls in a region almost free from telluric contamination and where the spectra have a very high S/N. An\nexample of the fitting for this line in star 2509 is shown in\nFig. 5. A few other features are also indicated; in particular, we can appreciate from this figure how the derived\nC, N abundances reproduce fairly well the clean CN feature just blueward of the Si i line. We find an average\n[Si/Fe]+0.09 (rms=0.06 dex).\n3\n\nCollisional damping used through this paper follows the\nprecepts by Barklem et al. (2000). However, Mg lines have a\nlarge effective number n\u2217 and are then outside the validity\nrange of these approximations.\n\n\fCarretta et al.: NGC 6253 and NGC 6791\n\nWe used spectrum synthesis of three or four moderately weak lines of Ca i (at 6156, 6161, 6163 and 6166 \u00c5)\nand checked them with the 6717 \u00c5 line (which is blended\nwith Fe i, hence provides less reliable abundances). They\ngive the average value [Ca/Fe]=\u22120.02 (rms=0.12) dex. We\nwish to note that our synthesis well reproduces the wings\nof the Ca i 6162.17 \u00c5 line, a very good indicator of surface\ngravity (see e.g., Mishenina et al. 2006, who used it in field\nRC stars, and literature therein); this is an independent\nvalidation of the gravities we adopted.\nOnly one Ti i line was available for synthesis, and only\nin star 3595; we derived the rather uncertain value of\n[Ti/Fe]= \u22120.19, that we retain since this same line was\nmeasured in all four NGC 6791 stars.\nThe average of \u03b1 elements is [\u03b1/Fe]= \u22120.03\n(rms=0.12) if we consider all four species, and [\u03b1/Fe]=\n\u22120.03 (rms=0.07) if we exclude Ti. In both cases this\nvalue conflicts with the earlier claim of \u03b1 enhancement\nby Twarog et al. (2003) and confirms their later conclusion (Anthony-Twarog et al. 2007; see also Sestito et al.\n2007 for a very similar result).\n\nIron peak elements - We measured the abundances of Sc,\nMn and Ni. Of the four Sc ii lines, only one was available in all stars; for the three others we considered the\nhyperfine structure (HFS, see Gratton et al. 2003 for references). The Sc abundance was found remarkably constant\nand we derived the average abundance [Sc/Fe]= \u22120.06\n(rms=0.01) dex.\nThe Mn abundance was derived from the three saturated lines at 6013-6021 \u00c5, admittedly not very sensible\nto abundance variations. We took HFS into consideration;\nthe three lines gave reasonably consistent values and we\nfound an average [Mn/Fe]= +0.04 (rms=0.07) dex.\nThe Ni abundance is based on two lines, and the average value is [Ni/Fe]= \u22120.05, without scatter.\nAll three Fe-peak elements have solar scaled ratios;\nthis is expected for Sc and Ni. The \"right\" Mn abundance\nis more difficult to tell, since it appears decoupled from\nthe iron one for most metallicities (Gratton et al. 2004).\nFurthermore, there are very few measures for open clusters, and none for so metal-rich ones (see e.g., De Silva et\nal. 2007).\n\nNeutron capture elements - The Ba abundance was derived from two or three strong lines, for which HFS (from\nProchaska et al. 2000) was considered; the final average\nvalue is [Ba/Fe]ii= +0.16 (rms=0.04). This element has\nbeen measured for many OCs, finding a very scattered distribution, with abundances varying by more than 1 dex\n(e.g., De Silva et al. 2007).\nFinally, we measured one Eu line, finding the remarkably constant value [Eu/Fe]ii= +0.03.\n\n9\n\n4.2. NGC 6791\nIn G06 we determined Fe, C, O (and N) abundances in\nNGC 6791. Here we applied to our spectra the same technique described above for NGC 6253 but given the different instrument, wavelength coverage and S/N not all lines\nsynthesized for NGC 6253 were available for NGC 6791\ntoo.\nUnfortunately the region near 6150-6170 \u00c5 falls near\nthe separation between the two chips in the SARG mosaic with our setting and it was either missing or badly\nextracted in several spectra, depending on the exact location of the stars along the slit. For this reason we were\nable to reliably determine the Na abundance only for two\nstars (2014 and SE49) and using only the 6154 \u00c5 line. At\nvariance with NGC 6253, where the Na abundance shows\nno scatter, we found two quite differing values, giving an\naverage [Na/Fe] = +0.13 (rms=0.21) dex.\nAlso the Ca abundance was derived using the four lines\nbetween 6156.10 and 6166.44 \u00c5 only for the same two\nstars; for the two others we had to use only the 6717.69 \u00c5\nline; there is no significant scatter for the Ca abundance\nand the average value is [Ca/Fe] = \u22120.15 (rms=0.08) dex.\nMg was measured only from the triplet near 6319 \u00c5 and\nthe abundance ratio found is enhanced with respect to\nthe solar ratio ([Mg/Fe] = +0.20, rms=0.05). The Ti line\nchosen was instead visible in all four stars and the average value is [Ti/Fe] = +0.03 (rms=0.09). In the case of\nNGC 6791 [\u03b1/Fe] = +0.02 (rms=0.14) dex.\nIndividual results for the four stars and average cluster\nvalues are presented in Tables 7 and 8 respectively. Here\nwe also show the individual O and C abundances, while\nin G06 we only presented the averages for the four stars.\nNote that the present values slightly differ from the ones\ngiven in G06, since we used there different solar reference\nvalues. The present ones are as in Gratton et al. (2003)\nand Carretta et al. (2005) and will consistently be used\nfor all the BOCCE clusters.\n\n5. Literature studies\n5.1. Other analyses of the two clusters\nWe will restrict our comparison to papers based on\nhigh resolution spectroscopic studies in the case of\nNGC 6791, but consider also intermediate-band photometry for NGC 6253, for which the literature is far less\ncopious.\nInitial studies of NGC 6253 concentrated on broadband photometry (Bragaglia et al. 1997; Sagar et al. 2001),\nin one case coupled with integrated spectra (Piatti et al.\n1998). These papers agreed on a rather old age (from 2.5\nto about 5 Gyr) and a high metallicity ([Fe/H]=+0.2 to\n+0.4).\nAs part of their series on Str\u00f6mgren photometry of\nopen clusters, Twarog et al. (2003) presented a study\nbased on uvbyCaH\u03b2 photometry (and a comparison to\nliterature broad-band data). NGC 6253 is outside the calibrations available at the time of the \u03b4m1 and \u03b4hk in-\n\n\f10\n\nCarretta et al.: NGC 6253 and NGC 6791\n\nTable 7.

With some extrapolations, they derived formal values of [Fe/H] of +0.7 to +0.9 dex, but their best fit with\nisochrones led to [Fe/H] closer to +0.4, a significant \u03b1enhancement, and an age between 2.5 and 3.5 Gyr. In\nAnthony-Twarog et al. (2007) they revised these results\nusing an updated version of the colour-metallicity relations for Str\u00f6mgren photometry, valid in the super-metal\nrich regime, and favoured instead solar scaled \u03b1-elements,\na reddening E(B \u2212 V ) = 0.16 \u00b1 0.025, an age of about\n3 Gyr, and [Fe/H]= +0.58 \u00b1 0.04. Following the reasoning in G06 (sect. 3.3 and Table 4), had we adopted their\nlower reddening instead of the value 0.23, we would have\nobtained a metallicity about 0.13 dex higher (the decrease\nin temperature also implies a decrease in microturbulent\nvelocity and [Fe/H] is much more sensible to variations\nin the latter at these metallicities and temperatures). An\nimportant feature of their reanalysis of NGC 6253 is that\nthe similarity of results from the \u03b4m1 index (that is dominated by CN features) and the \u03b4hk index (dominated by\nCa) should indicate that [C/Ca]\u223c0 for this cluster (we actually find a value of 0.1 dex). This is at variance with\nNGC 6791, where the two indices give discrepant results;\nAnthony-Twarog et al.

While C and N have less undersolar ratios\nin NGC 6253 than in NGC 6791 we do not know if this is\nenough to explain the different behavior of the metallicity\nindices in the two clusters.\nWe presented a preliminary metallicity for NGC 6253\n(Carretta et al. 2000) based on two objects, the red clump\nstars 2508, later reobserved, and 2971. The spectra were\nobtained on July 1998 with EMMI on the ESO New\nTechnology Telescope as a backup in poor weather conditions, at R=28000, degraded to about R\u224315000 to improve the rather low S/N. From equivalent widths (EWs)\nanalysis we found an average [Fe/H]=+0.36 \u00b1 0.20 and\nconcluded that the value could be taken as indicative of a\nmetal abundance larger than solar, but with a large error\nattached. Further spectra at higher resolution and S/N\nwere deemed necessary to conclusively define the cluster\nmetallicity; the present work supersedes the old analysis.\nThe only other detailed analysis of high resolution\nspectra of NGC 6253 is by Sestito et al. (2007), who\nanalyzed 5 stars observed with UVES/FLAMES, in\ndifferent evolutionary phases (RC, RGB, SGB and\nTurn-Off). There are no stars in common with our\nset. Since they were mostly dealing with warmer stars\nthan the ones studied here, they used EWs, only using\n\n\fCarretta et al.: NGC 6253 and NGC 6791\n\nTable 8.

For the elements\nin common, they derived [Fe/H]=+0.39, [Si/Fe]=+0.02,\n[Ca/Fe]=\u22120.04,\n[Ti/Fe]=\u22120.01,\n[Mg/Fe]=+0.30,\n[Ni/Fe]=+0.08, [Ba/Fe]=+0.23, and [Na/Fe]=+0.07.\nThese values are in agreement with ours, with the exception of Ti (but our abundance is based on only one line\nin one star), Mg (that both papers consider among the\nless reliable derivations), and Na (for which two different\ncorrections for NLTE were applied; actually their average\nLTE value is +0.20, similar to ours).\nThe literature on NGC 6791 is far more abundant\nbecause of its unique combination of very old age and\nhigh metallicity, that raised considerable interest. After\nthe work by Peterson & Green (1998) who analyzed a\nsingle red horizontal branch star, this old, metal rich cluster has been the subject of three recent independent papers based on high resolution spectra. Our own (G06),\nCarraro et al. (2006) who measured [Fe/H] and elemental\nabundances for a sample of ten red giants observed with\nHYDRA at R=17000 finding [Fe/H]=+0.39, and Origlia\net al. (2006) who used the near IR spectra at R=25000\nof six cold giants obtained with NIRSPEC at R=25000\nto determine[Fe/H]=+0.35 and several elemental abundances. Finally, in a very recent paper Anthony-Twarog\net al. (2007) derived [Fe/H]=+0.45, based on the version\nof the colour-metallicity relations for Str\u00f6mgren photometry valid for very high metallicity stars.\nWe will compare our findings to the spectroscopic\nworks by Peterson & Green (1998), Carraro et al. (2006)\nand Origlia et al. (2006). Table 9 shows the abundances\nfor the species in common; errorbars on these elemental\nratios are of the order of 0.1 or 0.2 dex, depending on\nthe species, in all papers. The agreement between differ-\n\n11\n\nent analyses is far from satisfactory. Iron shows formally\nthe best accord since all measures agree within the quoted\nerrorbars. Our measures are in good agreement with the\nothers' for some elements (e.g., for Mg, Si, Ti, Ni) while\nthere are significant differences for other elements (e.g.,\nfor O, Na, Ca, and most notably N). We have no real explanation for this. A real comparison is difficult even if\nall investigators employed spectrum synthesis to analyze\nthe data, because the studies use different stars and systematics can be hard to assess. Peterson & Green (1998)\nanalyzed a single red HB star, i.e., a star much hotter\n(about 7300 K) than everyone else; Origlia et al. (2006)\nstudied cold M giants (3600-4000 K) in a completely different wavelength range (the near IR); finally, Carraro et\nal. (2006) chose stars similar to ours (RC and RGB stars\nof magnitude comparable to the RC).\nThe latter study has also one star in common with us\n(their 8082, our SE49) and we may attempt some direct\ncomparison. Both studies obtained for this star spectra\nof similar S/N (about 40), and measured a similar radial\nvelocity (\u221246.18 km s\u22121 for them and \u221245.63 km s\u22121 for\nus) but our spectra have a resolution of about 30000 while\ntheirs of about 17000. They assumed a distance modulus\n(m \u2212 M )0 = 12.79, with E(B \u2212 V ) = 0.09 (from Stetson\net al. 2003) i.e., (m \u2212 M )V = 13.07, and derived temperatures from B \u2212 V and V \u2212 I colours using three different relations. We adopted (m \u2212 M )V = 13.45, with\nE(B \u2212 V ) = 0.15 (as an average of literature determinations) and derived the temperature from V \u2212 K and the\nAlonso et al. (1999) relations. The adopted atmospheric\nparameters for temperature, gravity and microturbulent\nvelocity are quite different: Tef f = 4410, log g = 2.81,\nvt = 1.00 for Carraro et al. (2006) and Tef f = 4512,\nlog g = 2.32, vt = 1.05 for G06.\nThe difference in temperature is mainly due to the different reddening values adopted; had Carraro et al. (2006)\nadopted the same higher reddening we used, they would\nhave obtained temperatures similar to ours. The differing\ngravity is only partly due to the combination of lower temperature and shorter distance modulus. The large residual difference would be explained had they used a mass of\nabout 2.5 M\u2299 , compared to the 0.9 M\u2299 we adopted; they\ndo not give explicitly the value, but this is what we understand from the spectral type and the Straizys & Kuriliene\n(1981) work referenced in their paper. This large mass is\nin contrast with the old age of the cluster.\nIs there any way of independently checking the soundness of the assumptions on distance and reddening? We\nhave not yet studied NGC 6791 using the synthetic colourmagnitude diagrams technique adopted for the BOCCE\nsample; however, we note that our values are close to the\nones found by King et al. (2005) on HST/ACS photometric data and to the ones derived by Anthony-Twarog\net al. (2007) on Str\u00f6mgren data. The latter also provide\n(their sect. 6.3) an interesting discussion on the validity\nof different comparisons between the photometric data\nand isochrones and on the inconsistency of a reddening\nas low as E(B \u2212 V ) = 0.09.

From the\nGirardi et al. (2000) ones they confirm the reddening but\nfind a best fit with (m \u2212 M )V = 13.35 or 13.45 depending\non the age; from the Y2 ones (Yi et al. 2001) they find best\nfit values of (m \u2212 M )V = 13.35 and E(B \u2212 V ) = 0.13.\nHowever, they do not discuss the impact of these new\nparameters on their metallicity derivation. G06 discussed\n(their Sect. 3.3) the adopted temperature and reddening,\nfinding that strongly differing values would result in gravities implying absolute magnitudes of the RC stars incompatible with what is expected from evolutionary models\n(i.e., MV \u223c 1.2, Girardi & Salaris 2001). We note also\nthat with our adopted gravities we were able to reproduce\nvery well the wings of the 6162.17 \u00c5 Ca i line which, as\nsaid in Sect. 4.1, is a good indicator of surface gravity.\nThe difference in adopted atmospheric parameters is\nnot the main cause of the (small) difference in metallicity,\nas can be seen from the sensitivity of [Fe/H] on parameters\nvariation (Table 6). Our analysis and the one by Carraro\net al. (2006) use different synthesis codes and line lists ad\ncannot be readily compared. However, we note that the\nnot ideal resolution of the HYDRA spectra has a direct\nimpact on continuum tracing. From their fig. 4, the continuum level may have been underestimated by about 2%,\nimplying a [Fe/H] lower by 0.1 dex. This (systematic) error of about 0.1 dex is within the uncertainties that can\nbe reached with the quality of the HYDRA spectra for\nthese very line-rich stars. The uncertainty in continuum\ntracing is lower in our spectra because of resolution and\nS/N (R\u223c 30000 versus \u223c 17000 and S/N higher by about\na factor 1.5). We conclude that the difference of 0.08 dex\nin the mean cluster metallicity is well within of the (combined) uncertainties of the two derivations.\nFinally, the difference in mean cluster metallicity between our work and Carraro et al. (2006) is small and has\nno impact on the science discussed in the two papers.\n\n5.2. Literature on high metallicity stars\nAre NGC 6253 and NGC 6791 rare and unusual ? The\nanswer is important if we want to gain more insight into\ntheir origin and to use them to understand the formation,\nthe early enrichment and the metallicity distribution of\nthe disk.\nThese two OCs are so metal rich that it is not easy\nto find suitable comparison samples in the literature, specially of giants, to see if the derived abundances follow the\n\"normal\" trends generally found for disk objects. We consider here various possible comparisons: i) the very metalrich giant star \u03bc Leo, already used in G06 to confirm the\nvalidity of our assumptions and method, with abundances\ntaken from Gratton & Sneden (1990) but brought to our\nsame solar reference scale (see Table 8); ii) the sample of\nthin and thick disk dwarfs in Soubiran & Girard (2005),\nwho put together and tried to homogenize a large number\nof studies4 ; iii) the metal-rich local dwarfs by Castro et\nal. (1997) and Pompeia et al. (2003), who selected stars of\nsupposed inner disk or bulge origin on the basis of kinematics; iv) the field disk RC stars studied by Mishenina\net al. (2006); v) the disk and the bulge giants in Fulbright\net al. (2007). As usually done when such comparisons are\npresented, no effort was taken to study or correct for systematics between all samples; we only note, for example,\nthat \u03bc Leo has [Fe/H]=+0.32 in Fulbright et al. (2007)\nand +0.46 in our scale.\nFig. 6 shows the run of O, Na, Mg, Al, Si and Ca with\nmetallicity for all stars in these samples (open symbols\nare for dwarfs and filled symbols for giants); the two OCs\nplus \u03bc Leo are shown with larger symbols. The only two\ndisk samples that contain stars as metal-rich as NGC 6253\nand NGC 6791 are the ones by Castro et al. (1997) and\nPompeia et al. (2003), so we miss a direct comparison for\nO and Al.\nTaking into account that these ratios have an errorbar of about 0.1 dex, NGC 6253 and NGC 6791 display\nvery similar abundance ratios, as seen also from Table 8,\nwith the exception of Mg and Ti (note however that the\nMg abundances have a larger errorbar attached -see Sect.\n4.1- and that Ti is measured from one single line, and\nnot in all stars). Both clusters generally follow the trend\nof the disk samples or its reasonable extrapolation. The\nMg abundance in NGC 6791 seems more similar to that\nof the bulge giants in Fulbright et al. (2007) but, given\nalso that the distributions for disk and giant stars for Mg\ndiffer while they do not for the other elements, we do\nnot consider this as a strong indication that this cluster\nshows signature of a bulge-like origin. Carraro et al. (2006)\nsuggested that NGC 6791 is either of extragalactic origin or originated in the inner disk region, near the bulge.\nWhile the first hypothesis is completely unsupported by\nthe abundance ratios (ours or anyone else's), the second\n4\n\nAllende Prieto et al.

We plot with (grey) open circles the disk dwarf stars from Soubiran & Girard (2005), Castro et al. (1997) and\nPompeia et al. (2003). Filled circles are giant disk stars in Mishenina et al. (2006) and Fulbright et al. (2007); filled\ntriangles are giant bulge stars also from Fulbright et al. Note that the only samples extending to the high metallicity\nof NGC 6253 and NGC 6791 are the one by Castro et al. (they do not provide O and Al abundances) and the bulge\none by Fulbright et al.\none has received a confirmation by a new determination of\nthe cluster absolute motion and orbit (Bedin et al. 2006).\nClearly, NGC 6791 would require new theoretical studies to explain the very high metallicity for its age and to\nbetter understand its origin; however, these studies would\nhave to take into account that NGC 6791 is not perhaps\nan exceptional object since there are at least two old clusters with similar high metallicity and abundance ratios.\nFor a deeper insight on these clusters' properties and ori-\n\ngin, new, higher quality spectra would also be useful: not\nonly the abundances would stand on firmer grounds, but\nnew elements could be examined, e.g., adding more s- and\nr-process elements, that could be used to shed light on the\nenrichment path and discriminate among different origins.\nTo this end we would benefit of a larger wavelength coverage, Especially in the blue, higher S/N and much higher\nresolution than obtained by all the presently existing studies.\n\n\f14\n\nCarretta et al.: NGC 6253 and NGC 6791\n\nFig. 7.

Data for Sc and for Zr, Ba, Eu come\ndirectly from the paper by Allende Prieto et al. (2004), not rehomogeneized by Soubiran & Girard (2005); for the\nthree latter, also data from Castro et al. (1997) and Pompeia et al. (2003) were plotted.\n\n6. Summary\nWith this paper we add two clusters to the very metal-rich\nend of the BOCCE sample, that now comprises objects\nfrom [Fe/H]= \u22120.2 to more than +0.4 dex. The fact that\nwe concentrate on RC stars in all clusters helps to maintain a better homogeneity in our results, even if different\nspectrograph, or different analysis methods (EWs or synthetic spectra) are used. Furthermore, we use the same\nline lists, gf values, model atmospheres, reference solar\nvalues and we always check results of the EW analysis\nwith synthesis, at least for Fe.\n\nWe have analyzed high resolution spectra of four RC\nstars in NGC 6253 and derived, using spectrum synthesis,\ntheir metallicity; the cluster has [Fe/H]= +0.46 \u00b1 0.02 \u00b1\n0.08 dex (internal and systematic error). A fifth star is\npossibly a binary with the spectrum likely contaminated\nby the secondary. For this reason, it was not taken into\naccount in our results. We also derived abundances for the\nlight elements C, N, O, for Al and Na, for the \u03b1-elements\nMg, Si, Ca and Ti, for the iron-peak elements Sc, Mn, and\nNi, and for the neutron-capture elements Ba and Eu.\nOn the basis of the present analysis, NGC 6253 turns\nout to be as metal-rich as NGC 6791, up to now the\n\n\fCarretta et al.: NGC 6253 and NGC 6791\n\nonly cluster for which a metallicity well in excess of the\nHyades' had been convincingly derived, both on the basis of photometric data (e.g., Chaboyer et al. 1999) and\nof spectroscopic abundance analysis (Peterson & Green\n1998, Carraro et al. 2006, Origlia et al. 2006, and G06).\nOur metallicity determination for NGC 6253 is\nin agreement with the photometric derivations (e.g.,\nBragaglia & Tosi 2006, Anthony-Twarog et al. 2007). Also\nthe comparison with Sestito et al. (2007) is favourable. We\nhave measured Mg, Si, Ca (and Ti) abundances and the\nresulting [\u03b1/Fe] is solar, as also found recently by Sestito\net al. (2007) and Anthony-Twarog et al. (2007).\nWe have also completed our analysis of NGC 6791, deriving abundances for the same elements as in NGC 6253\nfor four RC stars. The two clusters show generally similar\nabundance ratios; an exception is Mg, which is overabundant in NGC 6791 -and more similar to values measured\nin bulge giants- but not in NGC 6253.\nIn NGC 6791 the [\u03b1/Fe] value is solar, confirming earlier results by Carraro et al. (2006) and Origlia et al.\n(2006) and only slightly differing with Peterson & Green\n(1998) who obtained [\u03b1/Fe]=+0.10. The agreement appears quite good, but could be completely accidental because of the different data sets and analysis methods.\nThe two clusters seem to follow rather well the trends\nof elemental ratios for metal-rich stars, as derived from\nthe comparison to different literature samples, both for\nfield dwarfs and giants and for bulge giants. They generally appear to conform to the disk stars run of elemental\nratios with [Fe/H], with the possible exception of Mg for\nNGC 6791.\nAcknowledgements.
