Non-perturbative correlations in hadrons\nSeveral recent experiments have shown that strong non-perturbative forces inside\nhadrons survive also at relatively large momentum transfer, Q2 & 2 \u2212 6 GeV2 .\nEvidence for this fact has come, for example, from the measurement of the pion\nspace-like form factor up to Q2 \u2243 2 GeV2 [1], and from the direct determination of\nthe proton GE (Q2 )/GM (Q2 ) ratio up to Q2 \u2243 6 GeV2 [2]. In these reactions, the\ndata are very far from the asymptotic perturbative QCD prediction. This behavior strongly contrasts with the observed perturbative scaling of the DIS structure\nfunctions, for Q2 & 1 GeV2 .\nIt is tempting to argue that the delay in the onset of the perturbative regime in\nthe electro-magnetic form factors simply reflects the fact that exclusive processes\nare very sensitive to the non-perturbative dynamics of hadronization. However, this\nexplanation is ruled-out by experiment: in fact, we know of at least one exclusive\nobservable, the \u03b3 \u03b3 \u2217 \u2192 \u03c00 transition form factor, which gently follows the perturbative prediction, already for Q2 & 1 \u2212 2 GeV2 .\nThe JLAB results on form factors have provided new important insight on the\ninteractions inside hadrons. The evidence for non-perturbative correlations at rather\nshort distances, of the order of the tenth of the fermi, rules-out models in which\n\u2217 email:\n\nfaccioli@ect.it\n1\n\n\fNovember 15, 2017\n\n2\n\nthe quarks move essentially as free particle inside a confining bag and feel the nonperturbative color field only when they approach the edge of the hadron, i.e. for\ndistances of the order \u223c 1 fm.\nFrom the comparison of the pion space-like form factor (which deviates from the\nperturbative prediction) and the \u03b3 \u03b3 \u2217 \u2192 \u03c00 transition form factor (which follows the\nperturbative prediction) we have to conclude that the non-perturbative short-range\ninteractions are strongly channel dependent: they are effective in some process, but\nthey are almost absent in some other. This property of the non-perturbative dynamics has been known for a long time: another example is the \"Zweig rule\" forbidding\nflavor-mixing, which works very well in the vector and axial vector meson channels,\nbut it is violated in the scalar and pseudo-scalar channels.\nThe channel-dependence of the non-perturbative correlations implies that the\nquark-quark interaction at low-energy has much more structure than a simple radial\npotential. It must at least be spin-dependent. Moreover, the rather large flavor\nasymmetry observed in DIS parton distributions suggests that it is also flavordependent. As a consequence, quarks are more correlated in some spin and flavor\nconfiguration than in other. Indeed, a number of phenomenological studies seem\nto indicate that quarks preferably correlate to form color- and flavor- anti-triplet\nscalar diquarks (see [3] and references therein).\nAn important testing ground for the spin-flavor structure of the non-perturbative\nquark-quark interaction is represented by weak-decays of hadrons. The natural scale\nof weak processes \u2212set by W boson mass\u2212 is much larger than all other scales\ninvolved in the hadron internal dynamics. Hence, weak interactions can be regarded\nas effectively local and can resolve small structures inside hadrons. Moreover, their\nexplicit dependence on flavor and chirality can be exploited to probe the spin and\nflavor structure of the non-perturbative QCD interaction. Among the large variety\nof weak hadronic processes, a prominent role is played by the non-leptonic decays of\nkaons and hyperons, which are characterized by the famous \u2206 I = 1/2 rule. Neither\nelectro-weak nor perturbative QCD interactions can account for the dramatic relative\nenhancement of the \u2206 I = 1/2 decay channels. Its origin must therefore reside in\nthe non-perturbative sector of QCD. Stech, Neubert and collaborators observed\nthat the experimental data on both hyperon and kaon decays could be understood\nby assuming strong diquark correlations in the scalar, color anti-triplet channel [4].\nThe evidence for short-range, spin-dependent non-perturbative correlations in\nhadrons naturally leads to the problem of identifying their dynamical origin. To\nthis end, it is instructive to analyze the non-perturbative scales in QCD. We know\nof at least two non-perturbative phenomena which occur at a momentum scale\nhigher than \u039bQCD : the dynamical breaking of chiral symmetry and the anomalous\nbreaking of the axial symmetry. The natural scale for the interactions related to\nchiral symmetry breaking is set by the mass of the lightest vacuum excitation which\nis not protected by chiral symmetry, the \u03c1-meson. Similarly, the typical scale of\ntopological interactions is given by the mass of the \u03b7 \u2032 meson. Hence, we should not\nbe surprised to find non-perturbative effects at the GeV scale.\n\n\fNovember 15, 2017\n\n3\n\nThe physical properties of the pion are certainly strongly influenced by the interactions responsible for the breaking of chiral symmetry. Presumably, these forces\nplay an important role in the lightest baryons.\n2. Why instantons?\nInstantons have been proposed long ago as the dynamical mechanism driving both\nthe saturation of the axial anomaly [5] and the spontaneous breaking of chiral\nsymmetry [6] [7] ( for a review see [8] ). The this hypothesis has been checked in a\nnumber of lattice-based studies [9].\nPhysically, instantons are gluon fields which are generated during tunneling\nevents between degenerate QCD vacua. Mathematically, they are non-perturbative\nsolutions of the Euclidean Yang-Mills equation of motion. Being minima of the YangMills action, they have been used in the context of a saddle-point (semi-classical)\nanalysis of the Euclidean QCD path integral [5].\nIn the Instanton Liquid Model (ILM) the functional integral over all possible\ngluon field configurations is replaced by a sum over the configurations of an ensemble\nof instantons and anti-instantons. The path integral can then be solved by exploiting the formal analogy between the Euclidean QCD generating functional and the\npartition function of a grand-canonical statistical ensemble. The phenomenological\nparameters in the model are the average instanton density n\u0304 \u2243 1 fm\u22124 \u2212 which\nrelates to the rate of tunneling in the vacuum \u2212 and the average instanton size\n\u03c1\u0304 \u2243 1/3 fm \u2212 which determines how long each tunneling event lasts for \u2212 . These\nvalues were extracted more than two decades ago from the global vacuum properties [6] and indicate that the diluteness (or \"packing fraction\") of the instanton\nensemble is a small parameter: \u03ba = n\u0304 \u03c1\u03044 \u2243 0.01. Tunnelings are fairly rare events.\nThe instanton field induces an effective vertex between quarks ('t Hooft interaction) which, for Q2 \u226a 1/\u03c1\u03042 , reduces to a 2 Nf -leg contact interaction. For example,\nfor Nf = 2 it reads:\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\n\u2020\n\u2212\n2\n\u2020 \u2212\n2\n\u2020\n\u2212\n2\n(\u03c8 \u03c3\u03bc \u03bd \u03c4a \u03c8) ,\nL\u2032 t H = G\u03c1\u0304,n\u0304 [ (\u03c8 \u03c4a \u03c8) \u2212 (\u03c8 i\u03b35 \u03c4 \u03c8) ] +\n2(2 Nc \u2212 1)\n(1)\nwhere \u03c4 \u2212 = (~\u03c4 , i) (~\u03c4 are isospin Pauli matrices), and Gn\u0304 \u03c1\u0304 is a coupling constant\ndepending on the typical density and size of instantons in the vacuum. The finite\nsize of the instanton field provides a natural cut-off scale for the 't Hooft interaction.\nThe non-perturbative instanton-induced interaction (1) has two important characteristic features: (i) it involves quarks of different flavor, (ii) it is chirality-mixing,\ni.e. quarks must flip their chirality any time they cross the field of an instanton.\nThese two properties distinguish the instanton-induced interaction from the perturbative quark-gluon vertex, which is flavor-blind and chirality-conserving.\nThe chirality-flipping nature of the 't Hooft vertex allows to understand why\ninstanton effects are strongly channel dependent. In fact, processes in which a quark\n\n\fNovember 15, 2017\n\n4\n\nundergoes a chirality-flip can occur any time there is an instanton nearby. In this\ncase, the corresponding matrix elements will get a contribution from the instantoninduced interaction at the leading order in the instanton packing fraction, i.e. o(\u03ba).\nConversely, transitions in which quarks do not change their chirality get contribution\nfrom instantons only at the next-to-leading order in the packing fraction, i.e. o(\u03ba2 ).\nThe physical reason is that the probability for two tunneling events to occur during\nthe same scattering process is suppressed, if tunnelings are sufficiently rare events.\nThis mechanism explains the suppression of non-perturbative effects in several\nchannels. A good example is the suppression of flavor-mixing in the vector and axialvector meson channels (Zweig rule). The Lagrangian (1) induces flavor-mixing. Due\nto its chirality-flipping structure, its contribution to the scalar and pseudo-scalar\nchannels is of o(\u03ba), so maximally enhanced. On the other hand, its contribution to\nthe vector and axial-vector channels is of o(\u03ba2 ), so much smaller.\nThe chirality-flipping structure of the 't Hooft Lagrangian (1) has been used to\nlook for signatures of instanton-induced interaction by means of lattice QCD simulations [10]. If the interaction between light quarks is mainly instanton-mediated,\nthen we expect a new chirality-flip any time quarks cross the field of an instanton.\nBased on this observation, one is led to consider the \"chirality-flip\" asymmetry con \u0304 pair to be found after an\nstructed by taking the ratio of the amplitude for a |u di\ninterval \u03c4 in a state in which the chiralities of the quark and the anti-quark are\ninterchanged, relative to the amplitude to remain in the same chirality state [11].\nIt can be shown that, in the quantum field theory formalism, such a ratio reads:\nR(\u03c4 ) =\n\n\u03a0P S (\u03c4 ) \u2212 \u03a0S (\u03c4 )\nAf lip (\u03c4 )\n=\n,\nAnon\u2212f lip (\u03c4 )\n\u03a0P S (\u03c4 ) + \u03a0S (\u03c4 )\n\n(2)\n\nwhere\n\u03a0P S (\u03c4 ) = h0|JP S (\u03c4 )JP\u2020 S (0)|0i,\n\u03a0S (\u03c4 ) =\n\nh0|JS (\u03c4 )JS\u2020 (0)|0i,\n\nJP S (x) = \u016b(x) i\u03b35 d(x),\nJS (x) = \u016b(x) d(x).\n\n(3)\n(4)\n\nNotice that the ratio R(\u03c4 ) must vanish as \u03c4 \u2192 0 (no chirality flips), and must\napproach 1 as \u03c4 \u2192 \u221e (infinitely many chirality flips).\nThe instanton picture gives a very specific prediction for the asymmetry (2). If\nquarks propagate in the vacuum for a time comparable with the typical interval\nbetween two consecutive tunneling events, they have a large probability of crossing\nthe field of an instanton. Hence, after some time, the quarks are most likely to be\nfound in the configuration in which their chirality is flipped and R(\u03c4 ) > 1. However,\nif one waits longer, then the quarks will \"bump\" into another instanton field, which\nwill re-flip their chirality and restore the initial chirality state. So, the probability\nto find the quark and antiquark in the flipped chirality state will start decreasing.\nHence, the instanton picture predicts that the function R(\u03c4 ) will have a maximum\nat \u03c4 \u223c n\u03041/4 .\nSuch a characteristic prediction of the instanton model has been checked on the\nlattice.

We recall that the vector and\naxial-vector point-to-point correlators receive contribution from instantons only at\no(\u03ba2 ). It is quite remarkable that the instanton-induced effects provide the correct\namount of non-perturbative correlations even when they are relatively suppressed:\nthere seems to be little room for additional non-perturbative dynamics, in these\ncorrelators.\nThis collection of lattice results represents a compelling evidence for large instanton contributions to the dynamics of light quark. On the other hand, it should\nbe mentioned that instantons couple much more weakly to heavy quarks, and that\nthe discussion of their role in pure gluon-dynamics is still rather controversial.\n\n\fNovember 15, 2017\n\n6\n1\n\nExperiment (SLAC)\nExperiment (JLAB)\nSIA\nRILM\n\n0.5\n\n2\n\nGE\n\n0.4\nJLAB\nMon.

Squares\nare result of many-instanton simulations in the ILM, and the dashed line is the SIA curve.\n\nFrom this discussion it follows that instantons represent natural candidates for\nthe microscopic dynamical mechanism underlying the short-range non-perturbative\ncorrelations in light hadrons. In the following sections we shall show that the ILM\nquantitatively reproduces the JLAB data on electro-magnetic form factors and explains why the perturbative regime sets-in very early in DIS and in the \u03b3 \u2217 \u03b3 \u2192 \u03c00\ntransition form factor. Moreover, we will also show that instantons generate a\nscalar, color anti-triplet diquark bound-state of roughly 450 MeV mass. Such strong\ninstanton-induced diquark correlations lead to a quantitative understanding of nonleptonic weak decays of hyperons and to an explanation of the \u2206 I = 1/2 rule.\n3. Instantons and the electro-magnetic structure of hadrons\nLet us first discuss the instanton contribution to the electro-magnetic form factors. The framework to compute momentum-dependent hadronic matrix elements,\nfrom vanishing to large momentum transfer, has been recently developed in a number of papers [15] [16] [17] [18] [19]. At large momentum transfer the calculations of\nhadronic matrix elements in the ILM can even be carried-out analytically, by means\nof the Single Instanton Approximation (SIA) [20]. This approach exploits the fact\nthat small-sized correlation functions are dominated by the interaction of the quarks\nwith a single instanton. At small or vanishing momentum transfer, many-instanton\neffects are important and one has to rely on numerical Monte Carlo methods to\ncompute the path integral and extract the matrix elements from appropriate ratio\nof correlation functions [19].\nThe result of our analytic calculation of the pion form factor at moderate and\n\n\fNovember 15, 2017\n\n7\n\nlarge momentum transfer [18] is reported in Fig.2. The instanton contribution is\no(\u03ba), i.e. maximally enhanced. The ILM can quantitatively reproduce the available\ndata and explain the deviation from the perturbative regime at large momentum\ntransfer.\nConversely, we have observed that in the \u03b3 \u03b3 \u2217 \u2192 \u03c00 transition form factor the instanton effects are of order o(\u03ba2 ), hence parametrically suppressed by an additional\npower of the packing fraction. This explains the early onset of the perturbative\nregime in such a form factor. Moreover, a calculation of the pion light-cone distribution amplitude in the ILM was performed in [21]. It was found that instantons\ncan explain the behavior of the low-energy experimental data (Q2 < 2 GeV2 ) for\nthe \u03b3 \u03b3 \u22c6 \u2192 \u03c0 0 transition form factor.\nOur ILM calculation of the proton electric form factor GE (Q2 ) is reported in\nFig.2 (right panel), where it is compared with a SLAC data at low Q2 and of the\nJLAB data at large-Q2. Again, the short-range correlations induced by instantons\nquantitatively explain the experimental data. Similar results have been obtained\nalso for the magnetic form factor [19].\nPhysically, the fact that instantons give very hard hadronic form factors can be\ninterpreted as follows. Due to the strong zero-mode attraction, the hadron wavefunction in coordinate space is very narrow and peaked around the origin. As a\nconsequence, the charge distribution changes very rapidly at short distances (see\nfor example Fig. 3, right panel) leading to large hard-momentum components in\nits Fourier transform (i.e. the form factor). However, due to the finite size of the\ninstanton, the zero-mode attraction cannot transfer infinitely large momenta. Hence,\nthe electric charge distribution has to become eventually flat, for distances much\nsmaller than the instanton size. Indeed, when Q2 & 10\u221215 GeV2 , we have observed\nthat the zero-mode contribution to the electro-magnetic correlation function rapidly\ndies-out and the perturbative regime is finally free to set-in. In conclusion, the ILM\npredicts that the perturbative limit will not be reached, in the kinematic region\naccessible to the forthcoming JLAB experiments.\nInstantons also provide a possible explanation of why DIS leading-twist perturbative evolution equations works so well, already for Q2 & 1 GeV2 . Lee, Weiss\nand Goeke [22] have shown that the instanton-contribution to the twist 3 operators\nin the Operator Product Expansion is parametrically suppressed by powers of the\npacking fraction \u03ba, in complete analogy with what we found in the \u03b3 \u03b3 \u2217 \u2192 \u03c00\ntransition form factor. Moreover, Ostrovsky and Shuryak have recently shown that\nthe ILM can explain the available data on azimuthal spin asymmetries in DIS [23].\n\n4. Instantons and the \u2206I = 1/2 rule for hyperon decays\nAs we have already mentioned, non-leptonic weak decays of hyperons are good\ntesting grounds for spin-dependent, non-perturbative instanton correlations.

The \u2206 I = 1/2 transition amplitudes are\nfound to be typically \u223c 20 times larger that the \u2206 I = 3/2 amplitudes (\"\u2206 I = 1/2\"\nrule).\nWe have calculated these amplitudes in the ILM [24]. Our results are reported\nand compared with the experiment in table 1. We have found that not only instantons can explain the \u2206 I = 1/2 rule, but also that the theoretical predictions for\nthe amplitudes were in quantitative agreement with experiment. Note that a \u223c 20%\ndiscrepancy between theory and experiemt is of the same order of the uncertainty\nwhich was introduced by assuming the flavor SU (3) limit in the calculation.\nIn [25] Kochelev and Vento (KV) computed the instanton contribution to nonleptonic kaon decays. On a qualitative level, they found a similar result: the inclusion\nof the instanton effects indeed produces a strong enhancement of the \u2206 I = 1/2\ndecay channel. On a quantitative level, such an enhancement was found to be still\ninsufficient to reproduce the experimental data. However, it should be mentioned\nthat non-leptonic kaon decays in the \u2206 I = 1/2 channel receive large contribution\nalso from final-state interactions, which have not been included in the KV analysis.\nMoreover, it is now clear that the KV calculation is undershooting the instanton\ncontributiona .\na The\n\nKV calculation was performed in the single-instanton approximation. In such an approach,\none treats explicitly the degrees of freedom of the closest instanton and introduces an additional\nparameter m\u2217 , which effectively encodes contributions from all other instantons. In their calculation, the authors adopted the phenomenological estimate for m\u2217 which was available at the time,\nm\u2217 \u2243 260 MeV. Later, the same parameter was rigorously defined, and determined from numerical\nsimulations in the ILM [20], It was found to be considerably smaller (m\u2217 \u2243 80 MeV).\n\n\fNovember 15, 2017\n\n9\n\n5. Instantons and diquarks\nThe instanton-induced interaction (1) in particularly attractive in the 0+ anti-triplet\ndiquark channel. The question whether such interaction leads to binding has been\nfirst posed in [26]. In an exploratory study based on numerical calculation of pointto-point correlation functions [28], Shuryak, Sch\u00e4fer and Verbaarshot found some\nindication of an instanton-induced deeply bound 0+ anti-triplet diquark, with a\nmass of roughly 450 MeV. On the other hand, Diakonov and collaborators have\nanalyzed the same channel by solving Schwinger-Dyson equations at the meanfield level (leading order in 1/Nc ) [29]. They found evidence for correlations, but\nno bindingb . The role of instanton-induced diquark correlations in the nucleon has\nbeen also investigated in the context of QCD sum-rules [27].\nIn order to clarify whether instantons do or do not generate a scalar diquark\nbound-state, we have computed numerically the diquark correlation function\nZ\nR\n\u2020\nG2(\u03c4 ) = d3 x h0| T [ JD (0, \u03c4 )JD\n(x, 0) P e dy\u03bc A\u03bc (y) ]|0i,\n(9)\nwhere JD (x) is the scalar color-antitriplet diquark interpolating operator and the\npath-ordered exponent has been inserted to assure gauge-invariance. If there is a\nbound-state diquark, then in the large Euclidean time limit the logarithm of the\ntwo-point function must scale linearly with \u03c4 :\n\u03c4 \u2192\u221e\n\nln G2(\u03c4 ) \u2192 \u03b1 \u2212 \u03c4 MD ,\n\n(10)\n\nwhere \u03b1 is a constant and MD should be smaller than twice the constituent quark\nmass. The result of our calculation (which accounts for the instanton-induced interaction to all orders and does not involve the large Nc limit) is presented in\nFig. 3 (left panel). Clearly, we found unambiguous evidence for a diquark boundstate with MD \u2243 450 MeV [30].\nAn important related problem is what is the size of such a diquark. To answer\nthis question we have extracted the diquark electric charge radius from its electromagnetic form factor [30] (see Fig. 3, right panel). We found that rE \u223c 0.7 fm\nwhich implies that the size of the diquark is comparable with that of the proton.\n6. Conclusions\nWe have reported on the results of a series of investigations on instanton-induced\ncorrelations. We have discussed a collection of lattice results which provide indications for large instanton-induced contributions to the dynamics of light quarks. We\nhave shown that the ILM provides a qualitative and quantitative understanding on\nthe global electro-weak structure of the pion and the proton. In particular, it can\nexplain the fact that the short-range non-perturbative correlations are very strong\nin some reactions and almost absent in some others.\nb Except for N = 2, in which case the diquark is a baryon and its mass is protected by Pauli-Gursey\nc\nsymmetry.\n\n\fNovember 15, 2017\n\n10\n1\nRILM\ndipole\n-2\n\nln G2(t)\n\n2\n\nFD(Q )/ed\n\n-4\n\n-6\n\n0.5\n\n-8\n\n-10\n\n0\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n0\n\n0.25\n2\n\n2\n\nQ [GeV ]\n\nt [fm]\n\nFig. 3.\nLEFT PANEL: Logarithm of the diquark two-point function, ln G2(\u03c4 ) computed in the Random\nInstanton Liquid Model.
