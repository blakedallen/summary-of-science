Introduction\nAccretion discs are found in a number of astrophysical environments. These include protostellar discs around T Tauri stars,\nand around compact objects in cataclysmic variable and Xray binary systems. Most T Tauri stars associated with lowmass star-forming regions are observed to be members of binary systems, where the peak in the distribution of separations occurs at approximately 30 AU (Leinert et al. 1993).\nStudies of the tidal interaction between a circumstellar disc\nand a binary companion indicate that tidal truncation occurs at a ratio of binary separation to disc radius D/R \u2243\n3 for an equal mass binary (Artymowicz & Lubow 1994;\nLarwood et al. 1996; Kley & Nelson 2008). Given that 30 AU\nis smaller than typical disc sizes observed in T Tauri systems\n(Edwards et al. 1987), protostellar discs in many binary systems are often going to experience strong tidal effects.\nThere are observational indications that the disc and binary\norbital plane are not always coplanar. The binary system HK\nTau has been imaged, and shows compelling evidence for a\ndisc whose midplane is misaligned with the orbit of the bi-\n\nnary companion (Stapelfeldt et al. 1998). Terquem & Bertout\n(1993, 1996) have suggested that the reprocessing of radiation\nfrom the central star by a tilted and warped accretion disc could\naccount for the high spectral index of some T Tauri stars. A\nnumber of precessing jets have been observed in star forming\nregions, and the jet precession may indicate an underlying precessing disc from which the jet is launched (K\u00f6nigl & Ruden\n1993; Terquem et al. 1999). In the case of close X-ray binaries,\nthe objects SS433 and Her X-1 show evidence of precessing\njets and/or accretion discs (Boynton et al. 1980; Katz 1980;\nMargon 1984; Petterson 1977).\nAn early study of the equations describing the behaviour of\na thin non-coplanar viscous disc was undertaken by Petterson\n(1977). The resulting equations, however, lacked the property\nof conserving global angular momentum. This was addressed\nin subsequent work by Papaloizou & Pringle (1983), where\nthey showed that warps in discs for which h < \u03b1 < 1 evolve\ndiffusively on a timescale shorter than the usual viscous accretion by a factor \u03b12 , where \u03b1 is the dimensionless viscosity\ncoefficient (Shakura & Sunyaev 1973), and h is the disc aspect\n\n\f2\n\nM.M. Fragner & R.P. Nelson: Warped Accretion Discs in Binary Star Systems\n\nratio H/r. The opposite regime \u03b1 \u2264 h has been investigated\nby Papaloizou & Lin (1995) using linear perturbation theory.\nThey demonstrated that the governing equation for the disc tilt\nchanges from being a diffusion equation to a wave equation in\nthis physical regime, showing that warps propagate as bending\nwaves with a speed corresponding to half the sound speed, c s /2.\nAn analytic study of warped discs was undertaken by Ogilvie\n(2000) in which the mildly non linear evolution of disc warps\nwas examined.\n\nThe plan of the paper is as follows. In Sect. 2 we present\nthe basic equations of the problem. In Sect. 3 we describe the\nnumerical methods used in the simulations, and in Sect. 4 we\ndiscuss the linear theory of bending waves and calibrate the\nsimulation code against calculations based on linear theory. In\nSect. 5 we present our results for the tilted, tidally interacting\ndiscs, and in Sect. 6 we discuss our results and present our conclusions.\n\nThe tidal perturbation of an inviscid disc by a companion on an inclined circular orbit has been studied by\nPapaloizou & Terquem (1995) using linear theory. They investigate the disc response to tidal perturbations that have odd\nsymmetry with respect to the disc midplane and consider both\nzero and non-zero perturbing frequencies. They show that the\nzero-frequency (secular) mode leads to rigid precession of the\ndisc if the sound crossing time through the disc is smaller than\nthe differential precession time. Furthermore, they estimate that\nthe timescale for damping the inclination is of the same order as\nthe accretion timescale of the disc. A study of the twisting and\nwarping of viscous discs in binary systems was undertaken by\nLubow & Ogilvie (2000) using linear theory, and it was shown\nthat discs whose outer disc radii are smaller than the truncation\nradius maybe unstable to tilting.\n\n2. Basic equations\n\nNumerical simulations of tidally interacting discs which\nare not coplanar with the binary orbit have been performed by\nLarwood et al. (1996) using SPH simulations. They found that\nthe disc precesses approximately as a rigid body as long as the\ndisc aspect ratio is large enough. For smaller aspect ratios their\nresults suggest that the disc develops a modest warp, while for\nh \u2264 0.03 the disc becomes disrupted as a consequence of differential precession. Their results suggest that a disc can splitup into two distinct parts that behave independently. These\nSPH simulations also showed that the inclination evolves on\nthe viscous timescale, as expected from Papaloizou & Terquem\n(1995).\nThe goal of the present study is to examine in detail the\nstructure of misaligned accretion discs in close binary systems\nas a function of the important physical parameters: h, \u03b1, the\nouter disc radius R, and the inclination angle \u03b3F . The binary\ncompanion and the central star are assumed to be of equal mass.\nWe use a grid-based code (NIRVANA) to perform this study,\nand this code has a relatively small numerical viscosity compared with the SPH schemes used to perform previous studies.\nThis allows us to tightly control the disc viscosity, and therefore\nexamine in more detail its influence on the disc evolution. We\nconsider a broad range of disc parameters in which warps propagate either as bending waves h > \u03b1 or diffusively h < \u03b1. As\nwell as examining the quasi-steady disc structures which arise\nbecause of tidal interaction with the inclined companion, we\nalso examine the conditions under which a disc becomes disrupted due to strong differential precession. In particular we are\ninterested in examining whether the following criterion holds: a\ndisc will achieve a state of rigid-body precession if warp propagation across the disc (either through bending waves or diffusion) occurs on a timescale shorter than the differential precession time.\n\nWe consider the evolution of a thin, gaseous, viscous disc in\norbit around a central star, where the disc is perturbed by a\ncompanion star orbiting in a plane which is not coincident with\nthe disc midplane. For a range of physical parameters, it is expected that the disc will precess rigidly around the angular momentum vector of the binary system. The equations of continuity and motion for a viscous fluid in a precessing reference\nframe may be written as:\nD\u03c1\n+ \u03c1\u2207.v = 0\nDt\n\n(1)\n\n1\nDv\n= \u2212 \u2207P \u2212 \u2207\u03a8 + Svisc \u2212 2\u03a9 \u00d7 v \u2212 \u03a9 \u00d7 (\u03a9 \u00d7 r)\nDt\n\u03c1\n\n(2)\n\nwhere\n\u2202\nD\n=\n+v*\u2207\nDt \u2202t\nis the convective derivative, \u03c1 is the density, v the velocity and P\nthe pressure. The precession frequency is given by |\u03a9|, and the\ndisc angular momentum vector is assumed to precess around a\nvector pointing in the direction of \u03a9. The gravitational potential is \u03a8. We adopt a locally isothermal equation of state:\nP = c s (r)2 \u03c1\n\n(3)\n\nwhere the isothermal sound speed is defined by c s (r) = h * vKep .\nHere h is the aspect ratio of the disc, H/r, and vKep is the local\nkeplerian velocity. Svisc is the viscous force per unit mass:\nSvisc =\n\n1\n\u2207T\n\u03c1\n\n(4)\n\nwhere T is the viscosity stress tensor:\nT i j = \u03c1\u03bd\n\n\u2202vi \u2202v j 2\n+\n\u2212 \u03b4i j \u2207.v\n\u2202x j \u2202xi 3\n\n!\n\n(5)\n\nWe adopt the standard 'alpha' model (Shakura & Sunyaev\n1973) to specify the kinematic viscosity \u03bd = \u03b1c s H. We solve\nthe above equations numerically, using a system of spherical\ncoordinates r = (r, \u03b8, \u03c6).\n\n2.1. Orbital configuration\nWe work in a reference frame in which the origin of the coordinate system is fixed on the central star, and the secondary star\n\n\fM.M. Fragner & R.P. Nelson: Warped Accretion Discs in Binary Star Systems\n\nmoves on a circular orbit about the origin with position vector D. The gravitational potential, \u03a8, at any position vector r is\ntherefore given by:\n\u03a8=\u2212\n\nGMS\nGMS r * D\nGMP\n\u2212\n+\n,\nr\n|r \u2212 D|\nD3\n\n(6)\n\nwhere G is the gravitational constant, and MP and MS are the\nprimary and secondary masses, respectively. The first term is\ndue to the primary star, and the remaining two terms are due\nto the companion star. The last indirect term accounts for the\nacceleration of the origin of the coordinate system, which coincides with the location of the primary star. Note that there are\nno contributions to the potential due to the disc since we do not\ninclude disc self-gravity in our calculations, and the stars do not\nexperience a gravitational force due to the disc. Consequently\nthe binary orbital parameters remain unchanged.\nHence the secondary star feels the acceleration due to the\ncentral star and the indirect component of the potential. In a\nnon-precessing reference frame, centred on the central star,\nwhose x \u2212 y plane coincides with the orbital plane of the binary, the position vector of the companion in a circular orbit\nmay be written as:\nD = D * (cos (\u03c9t)e1 + sin (\u03c9t)e2 ),\nwhere D is the constant binary separation and \u03c9\np\nG(MP + MS )/D3 is the binary orbital angular velocity.\n\n(7)\n=\n\n3. Numerical methods\nThe system of equations described in Sect. 2 is integrated using the grid-based hydrodynamics code NIRVANA\n(Ziegler & Yorke 1997), adapted to solve the equations in a precessing reference frame. This code uses operator-splitting, and\nthe advection routine uses a second-order accurate monotonic\ntransport algorithm (van Leer 1977).\n\n3.1. Boundary conditions\nPeriodic boundary conditions were applied in the azimuthal\ndirection. At all other boundaries outflow conditions were\nadopted using zero-gradient extrapolation. Velocities at the radial boundaries were set to ensure that zero viscous stress occurs there.\n\n3.2. Units\nWe adopt a system of units such that the unit of mass is equal\nto that of the central star, MP , the unit of radius is equal to\nthe radius of the inner boundary of our computational domain,\nand we set the gravitational constant G = 1. The unit of time\nthen becomes 1/\u03a9K (1), where \u03a9K is the keplerian angular velocity evaluated at r = 1. When discussing simulation results,\nhowever, we will express time in units of the orbital period\nat r = 10, the nominal outer disc radius in the simulations.\nThus we describe a time interval of 2\u03c0\u03a9K (10)\u22121 as 'one orbit'.\nInclination and precession angles are described in units of degrees.\n\n3\n\n3.3. Reference frames and initial conditions\nThe numerical domain extends radially from r = [1, R], and\nazimuthally from \u03c6 = [0, 360\u25e6]. The outer radius, R, may differ\nfrom simulation to simulation. The meridional domain covers\nthe range \u03b8 = [90\u25e6 \u2212 \u2206\u03b8, 90\u25e6 + \u2206\u03b8], where again \u2206\u03b8 may vary\nbetween the simulations.\nWe perform simulations in two different reference frames.\nFor models in which the disc is expected to develop rigid precession, we solve the equations in a frame which precesses\naround the angular momentum vector of the binary. Given a\nsensible choice of the precession rate, this approach ensures\nthat the disc midplane always stays close to the equatorial plane\nof the computational domain where \u03b8 = 90\u25e6 , and allows simulations to be performed with large inclinations of the binary\norbit. If evolved in a non-precessing frame, the disc would precess around the binary angular momentum vector, causing it\nto eventually intersect with the upper and lower meridional\nboundaries of the computational domain if the binary inclination angle is large. Adopting a precessing reference frame allows simulations to be conducted with relatively small meridional domains, even for large binary inclinations, thus substantially reducing the computational expense involved.\nFor models in which substantial differential precession of\nthe disc is expected to arise, adopting a frame with a single precession frequency does not solve the problem described above,\nsince some parts of the disc inevitably intersect the meridional\nboundaries. As these models are of significant interest from\nthe astrophysical point of view (they will tend to be thin discs\nwith large viscosity, similar to those which occur in X-ray binaries for example), we have computed them in a non precessing\nframe, but have been forced to use large meridional domains\nand smaller binary inclination angles.\nWe denote coordinates in the precessing frame as r\u0302, while\ncoordinates in the non-precessing binary frame are denoted r.\nThe coordinates in the code frame are denoted with rC , where\nthe code frame can be one of either the precessing frame or\nthe binary frame. The transformation of any vector e from the\nbinary into the precessing frame is given by:\n\u00ea = RZ (\u03a9F t)RX (\u03b3F )e\nwith rotation matrices:\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\n0\n0\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec 1\n\uf8f7\nRX (\u03b3F ) = \uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec 0 cos(\u03b3F ) sin(\u03b3F ) \uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\n0 \u2212 sin(\u03b3F ) cos(\u03b3F )\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec cos(\u03a9F t) \u2212 sin(\u03a9F t) 0 \uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\nRZ (\u03a9F t) = \uf8ec\uf8ec sin(\u03a9F t) cos(\u03a9F t) 0 \uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7 .\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\n0\n0\n1\n\n(8)\n\n(9)\n\nThus to transform a vector from the binary into the precessing\nframe, we first rotate around the x-axis by an inclination angle \u03b3F and then rotate the resulting vector around the z-axis by\nan precession angle \u03a9F t. Here \u03a9F is the precession rate of the\nprecessing frame and t is the time elapsed. This transformation\nis particularly useful when setting up the initial conditions for\nthe simulations which are performed in the non-precessing binary frame, since we assume that the binary orbit lies in a plane\nwhich is coincident with the equatorial plane of the computational grid, with the disc being inclined by an angle \u03b3F .\n\n\f4\n\nM.M. Fragner & R.P. Nelson: Warped Accretion Discs in Binary Star Systems\n\n3.3.1. Model set-up in precessing frame\n\n3.3.2. Model set-up in binary frame\n\nIn the precessing frame the code midplane (defined to reside\nwhere \u03b8C = 90\u25e6 ) coincides with the disc midplane initially, so\nthat (rC \u2261 r\u0302). The initial density profile is chosen to satisfy hydrostatic equilibrium in the \u03b8\u0302-direction, which yields the result:\n\nWhen working in the non-precessing binary frame we set the\nprecession frequency \u03a9 = 0 in Eq. (2). Since the equatorial\nplane of the computational domain coincides with the binary\norbit plane (rC \u2261 r), the disc is inclined with respect to the\nequatorial plane of the computational grid by an inclination angle \u03b3F . We can use the transformation defined by Eq. (8) at\nt = 0 to relate the polar angles of the precessing frame to the\npolar angles of the binary frame. One particularly useful relation is given by:\n\n\u03c1(r, \u03b8\u0302) = r\n\n\u2212\u03b6\n\nh\n\ni\u0010 12 \u2212(\u03b6+1)\u0011\nsin (\u03b8\u0302) h\n,\n\n(10)\n\nwhere \u03b6 = 32 is the radial power law exponent of the density\nprofile. Note that this expression has the limit:\n\uf8eb \u0010\n\u0011 \uf8f6\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec \u03b8\u0302 \u2212 \u03c0 2 \uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\n2\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\n\uf8ec\nlim \u03c1(r, \u03b8\u0302) = r\u2212\u03b6 exp \uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\u2212\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f8 ,\n2\n\uf8ed\n2h\n\u03b8\u0302\u21920\n\nsin2 (\u03b8\u0302) = cos2 (\u03c6) sin2 (\u03b8) + cos2 (\u03b3F ) sin2 (\u03c6) sin2 (\u03b8)\n\nwhich is the familiar form of the density profile for thin discs.\nThe velocity in the \u03c6\u0302 direction is chosen to balance the forces\nin the radial direction:\n1\nv\u02c62\u03c6 = (1 \u2212 (\u03b6 + 1)h2 ).\nr\n\n(12)\n\nConsequently, the azimuthal velocity profile is slightly subkeplerian because of the radial pressure gradient. The velocities\nin the r and \u03b8\u0302 direction are chosen to be zero initially.\nWe set \u03a9 in Eq. (2) to point in the same direction as the binary\nangular momentum vector:\n\u03a9 = \u03a9F e3 = \u03a9F (\u2212 sin (\u03b3F )\u00ea2 + cos (\u03b3F )\u00ea3 )\n\n(13)\n\nwhere the last equality is derived using the transformation\ngiven by Eq. (8). The precession rate may be estimated using\nthe expression:\n\u03a9F = \u2212\n\n! RR\n\n3\n\n\u03a3r dr\n3GMS\n0\ncos (\u03b3F ),\nRR\n3\n4D\n3 \u03a9dr\n\u03a3r\n0\n\n(14)\n\nR\u221e\nwhere \u03a3 = \u2212\u221e \u03c1 r d\u03b8 is the disc surface density. Hence the precession frequency is determined by the ratio of the integrated\nexternal torque exerted by the secondary to the integrated angular momentum content of the disc (Papaloizou & Terquem\n1995). For the velocity and density profiles given by Eqs. (12)\nand (10), respectively, this evaluates to:\n\u03a9F\n3 R3 MS\ncos (\u03b3F ),\n=\u2212\n\u03a9d (R)\n7 D3 M P\n\n(15)\n\nv\u0302\u03c6 = v\u0302\u03c6 (\u2212 sin (\u03c6\u0302)\u00ea1 + cos (\u03c6\u0302)\u00ea2 )\n= v\u0302\u03c6 (\u2212 sin (\u03c6\u0302)e1 + cos (\u03c6\u0302) cos (\u03b3F )e2 \u2212 cos (\u03c6\u0302) sin (\u03b3F )e3 )\nUsing the relationship between the polar angles one can find\nan expression for v\u0302\u03c6 that is written entirely in terms of binary\nframe angles. The different components in the radial, azimuthal\nand meridional direction are then given by:\nvr = 0\ncos (\u03b3F ) sin (\u03b8) \u2212 sin (\u03c6) sin (\u03b3F ) cos (\u03b8)\nsin (\u03b8\u0302)\nsin (\u03b3F ) cos (\u03c6)\nv\u03b8 = v\u0302\u03c6\nsin (\u03b8\u0302)\n\nv\u03c6 = v\u0302\u03c6\n\nThus an observer moving with the disc sees an increased binary\nfrequency \u03c9 \u2212 \u03a9F due to the retrograde precession of the disc\n(i.e. \u03a9F is negative).\n\n(18)\n\nwhere v\u0302\u03c6 is given by Eq. (12) and sin (\u03b8\u0302) by Eq. (17). It can\nbe shown that this set of profiles satisfies the Euler equations\ngiven by Eqs. (1) and (2) with Svisc = 0, MS = 0, \u03a9 = 0 and\n\u03b3F = constant, since in a spherically symmetric potential there\nis no preferred direction for the disc rotation axis.\n\n3.4. Definition of precession and inclination angles\nIn order to follow the evolution of the disc structure we calculate the total angular momentum vector, L(r), for disc material\ncontained in each spherical shell in the numerical domain:\nZ 2\u03c0 Z \u03c0 +\u2206\u03b8\n2\nl * r2 sin (\u03b8) d\u03b8 \u03b4r\n(19)\nd\u03c6\nL(r) =\n\u03c0\n2 \u2212\u2206\u03b8\n\nwhere \u03b4r is the radial grid spacing and l is the angular momentum density:\nl = \u03c1r \u00d7 v = \u03c1(\u2212rv\u03c6 \u03b8C + rv\u03b8 \u03c6C ).\n\n(16)\n\n(17)\n\nwhich can be used to determine the initial density profile given\nby Eq. (10). The initial velocity is given by:\n\n0\n\nwhere \u03a9d (R) is the orbital angular velocity of the disc at radius\nR. The binary orbit given by Eq. (7), expressed in precessing\nframe coordinates, is given by:\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\ncos ([\u03c9 \u2212 \u03a9F ]t)\n\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\nD = D \uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec\uf8ec sin ([\u03c9 \u2212 \u03a9F ]t) cos(\u03b3F ) \uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7\uf8f7 .\n\uf8ed\n\uf8f8\nsin ([\u03c9 \u2212 \u03a9F ]t)) sin (\u03b3F )\n\n+ sin2 (\u03b3F ) cos2 (\u03b8)\n\u2212 2 cos2 (\u03b3F ) sin (\u03b3F ) sin (\u03b8) cos (\u03b8) sin (\u03c6)\n\n(11)\n\n(20)\n\n\u03b8C and \u03c6C are the code unit vectors in the meridional and azimuthal directions, respectively. Note that when working in the\nprecessing frame a term involving the precessional velocities\nshould be added to this expression. In practice we find that this\nis of negligible magnitude, because of the slow rate of precession, and therefore the term has been omitted. For disc material\n\n\fM.M. Fragner & R.P. Nelson: Warped Accretion Discs in Binary Star Systems\n\nlocated in a given spherical shell we locate the inclination angle, \u03b4, (equal to \u03b3F at time t = 0) between the disc and binary\nangular momentum vectors through:\ncos (\u03b4) =\n\nJB .L\n.\n|J B||L|\n\n(21)\n\nwhere JB represents the binary angular momentum vector. The\nprecession angle, \u03b2, measured in the binary plane can be defined through:\ncos (\u03b2) =\n\nwhich induces a change of the angular momentum vector of\ndisc material contained in a spherical shell is due to the gravitational interaction with the secondary star:\nL\u0307S (r) = L\u0307T (r) + L\u0307A (r),\n\n(22)\n\nwhere u is an arbitrary reference unit vector in the binary plane.\nWe choose u = \u2212e1 , so that the initial precession angle \u03b2 = 0 by\nthis definition. When working in the precessing frame \u2212e1 has\nto be expressed in precessing frame coordinates and becomes\ntime dependent.\nWhen discussing the results of the simulations we use the\nthe following terminology: a warp occurs if the angle \u03b4 becomes a function of radius in the disc; a disc develops a twist\nwhen \u03b2 becomes a function of radius; a disc is said to be broken if either \u03b2 or \u03b4 change discontinuously at some radius such\nthat the disc separates into two independently precessing parts;\na disc is said to be disrupted if \u03b2 varies smoothly by more than\n180 degrees across the disc radius because of differential precession.\n\n3.5. Calculation of torque contributions\nLater in this paper we will be interested in measuring the different contributions to the changes in the precession and inclination angles for disc material located at different radii in the\ncomputational domain. As a first step we calculate the rate of\nchange of the angular momentum vector L(r) associated with\ndisc material located at radius r, which involves integrating\nover the individual spherical shells in the computational domain.\nUsing the continuity and momentum Eqs. (1) and (2) to\nexpress the velocity and density changes in Eq. (20), and assuming that the density vanishes at the meridional boundaries,\nwe find the result:\nL\u0307(r) = L\u0307F (r) + L\u0307V (r) + L\u0307S (r)\n\n(26)\n\nwhere the angular momentum change due to torques is given\nby:\nZ 2\u03c0 Z \u03c0 +\u2206\u03b8\n2\nt * r2 sin (\u03b8) d\u03b8 \u03b4r\n(27)\nd\u03c6\nL\u0307T (r) =\n0\n\n(JB \u00d7 L).u\n,\n|JB \u00d7 L|\n\n5\n\n\u03c0\n2 \u2212\u2206\u03b8\n\nand the torque density t is given by:\n\"\n#\n1 \u2202\u03a8\n\u2202\u03a8\nt = \u2212\u03c1r \u00d7 \u2207\u03a8 = \u03c1\n\u03b8C \u2212\n\u03c6C .\nsin (\u03b8) \u2202\u03c6\n\u2202\u03b8\n\n(28)\n\nWhen working in the precessing frame there is an additional\nterm causing angular momentum change due to Coriolis and\ncentrifugal forces:\nZ 2\u03c0 Z \u03c0 +\u2206\u03b8\n\u0011\n\u0010\n2\n\u03c1 r2 sin (\u03b8) d\u03b8 \u2212r\u2206v\u03c6 \u03b8C + r\u2206v\u03b8 \u03c6C \u03b4r\nd\u03c6\nL\u0307A (r) =\n\u03c0\n2 \u2212\u2206\u03b8\n\n0\n\nwith\n\u2206v\u03c6 = (\u22122\u03a9 \u00d7 v \u2212 \u03a9 \u00d7 (\u03a9 \u00d7 r)) \u03c6C\n\u2206v\u03b8 = (\u22122\u03a9 \u00d7 v \u2212 \u03a9 \u00d7 (\u03a9 \u00d7 r)) \u03b8C .\n\n(29)\n\nIn the following we are only interested in the torque components expressed in precessing frame coordinates. Thus all the\ntorque components have been calculated now for simulations\nperformed in the precessing frame. However, when working in\nthe binary frame, we perform the above calculations and then\nproject each of the torque components onto precessing frame\ncoordinate axes to ensure a uniform approach to monitoring\nthe torque contributions. Since the latter are time dependent,\nthe additional term when working in the binary frame is given\nby:\nL\u0307A (r) = \u2212\u03a9 \u00d7 L\u0302\nThis term accounts for the angular momentum change measured in the precessing frame that arise because of the precession of the frame.\n\n(23)\n\n3.6. Calculation of precession and inclination rates\nwhere a dot denotes a time derivative.

The last term in Eq. (23)\n\nWe can now relate the above torques to the rate of change of the\nprecession and inclination angles. When working in the precessing frame, the inclination angle \u03b4 and precession angle \u03b2\nfor disc material in a given radial shell, as defined by Eqs. (21)\nand (22), are given by:\ncos(\u03b2) =\n\ncos(\u03b4) =\n\ncos(\u03a9F t)(sin(\u03b3F )LZ + cos(\u03b3F )LY ) + sin(\u03a9F t)LX\ni1\nh\n(sin(\u03b3F )LZ + cos(\u03b3F )LY )2 + L2X 2\n\u2212 sin(\u03b3F )LY + cos(\u03b3F )LZ\n.\n|L|\n\n(30)\n\nNote that the vector components LX , LY and LZ in the above\nexpression, and in the remaining expressions in this subsection, should have hat symbols because they are measured in\n\n\f6\n\nM.M. Fragner & R.P. Nelson: Warped Accretion Discs in Binary Star Systems\n\nthe precessing frame. We neglect these, however, in order to\nsimplify the notation. For sufficiently rigidly precessing discs\nthe deviation from the mean precession frequency \u03a9F will be\nsmall, and the disc midplane will remain close to the equatorial\nplane of the computational domain. In this case we can use the\napproximation:\nLX \u226a LZ\n\nLY \u226a LZ .\n\n(31)\n\nWith this approximation, Eq.

Likewise the precession angle is the sum of precession\ndue to the frame and a small deviation term that is proportional\nto the x-component of the angular momentum vector. The advantage of this approximation is that the precession and inclination angles become linear functions of the torque components.\nThis allows us to write:\n!F\n!V\n!S\n\u2202\u03b4\n\u2202\u03b4\n\u2202\u03b4\n\u2202\u03b4\n=\n+\n+\n\u2202t\n\u2202t\n\u2202t\n\u2202t\n!F\n!V\n!S\n\u2202\u03b2\n\u2202\u03b2\n\u2202\u03b2\n\u2202\u03b2\n+\n+\n(33)\n= \u03a9F +\n\u2202t\n\u2202t\n\u2202t\n\u2202t\nwhere each of the rates are calculated according to Eq.

When discussing contributions to differential precession rates later in the paper, we will\nomit the constant mean precession rate \u03a9F of the precessing\nframe in the expression for the total rate given by Eq. (33).\n\n4. Linear theory of free warps and bending waves\nIn order to calibrate the code, we now examine how well\nit is able to model the propagation of free bending waves,\nand compare the results with linear theory. The linear theory of warps in accretion discs was initially investigated\nby Papaloizou & Pringle (1983). Their analysis is valid in\na regime in which the dimensionless viscosity parameter \u03b1\n(Shakura & Sunyaev 1973) lies in the range h \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 1. In\nthis regime, globally warped discs were found to evolve diffusively, with a diffusion coefficient larger than that associated with mass flow through the disc by a factor of \u223c 2\u03b11 2 ,\n\nassuming an isotropic viscosity. Papaloizou & Lin (1995) investigated the regime in which \u03b1 \u2264 h, and showed under that,\nfor low frequency modes, the governing equation for the disc\ntilt changes from being a diffusion equation to a wave equation,\nsuch that warps are communicated through the disc via propagation of bending waves. In a keplerian disc these are expected\nto propagate with little dispersion at half the sound speed, c s /2.\nNelson & Papaloizou (1999) used smooth particle hydrodynamic simulations to examine the propagation of free bending waves, comparing their numerical results with linear calculations. Overall, they found that the SPH code managed to\nmodel the propagation of bending waves quite accurately as\nlong as the warp amplitude remains small such that linear theory holds. One drawback associated with using SPH for that\nproblem, however, was the fairly large numerical viscosity associated with the scheme which is difficult to control and specify ab initio.\nIn this section we compare our numerical results with\na linear calculation, adopting a similar set-up to the one\nused by Nelson & Papaloizou (1999). The equations describing the evolution of linear bending waves have been derived\nby Nelson & Papaloizou (1999). We do not reproduce the full\nderivation here, but rather mention some of the salient points\nassociated with the derivation.\n\n4.1. An initial value problem\nSmall-amplitude warps can be considered to be linear perturbations of a disc with midplane initially coincident with the\n(e1 , e2 ) plane. Taking the \u03c6 dependence of the perturbations\nto be \u221d eim\u03c6 , with m = 1 for global warps, the Euler equations written in cylindrical coordinates (r, \u03c6, z) can be linearised\n(Papaloizou & Lin 1995; Nelson & Papaloizou 1999). An analytical solution to the linearised equations corresponds to the\ncase of a rigid tilt. In this case the velocity and pressure perturbations are given by:\nv\u2032r = \u2212z\u03a9K \u03b4\nd(r\u03a9K )\nv\u2032\u03c6 = \u2212iz\u03b4\ndr\nv\u2032z = r\u03a9K \u03b4\nW \u2032 = \u03c1\u2032\n\nc2S\n= \u2212irz\u03a92K \u03b4\n\u03c1\n\n(35)\n\nwhere \u03a9K is the Keplerian angular frequency and \u03b4 is a small\nconstant inclination. For large scale warps, it is expected that\nthe local inclination \u03b4 varies on a length scale significantly\nlarger than the disc thickness H = h * r. It is then reasonable\nto assume the inclination is also approximately independent of\nz.

Thus they can be used to follow the evolution of a bending\ndisturbance from initial data. Below we use the time-dependent\nsolution calculated in this way to test NIRVANA's ability to\npropagate bending disturbances.\nAssuming a time dependence of the perturbations \u221d ei\u03c3t ,\nwith the wave frequency obeying the relation \u03c3 \u226a \u03a9K for\nslowly varying warps, one can derive algebraic equations for\nthe perturbed quantities. These show that warps induce horizontal motions and vertical\nshear in the disc through terms\n\u0010 \u2202v\u2032 \u2202v\u2032\u03c6 \u0013\nr\nproportional to \u2202z , \u2202z (Papaloizou & Lin 1995). Physically,\nthese horizontal motions are generated by pressure forces in the\ndisc which arise from the vertical misalignment of neighboring\nregions of the disc midplane. They are responsible for driving\nthe bending wave, which propagates with approximately half\nthe sound speed.\nThe main effect of viscosity in the disc is to damp these horizontal motions, reducing the efficacy of bending wave prop-\n\nagation. As the viscosity increases and \u03b1 > h, the bending disturbance begins to evolve diffusively on a time scale\nthat scales inversely with \u03bd/(2\u03b12 ) (Papaloizou & Pringle 1983),\nwhere this latter quantity is now the diffusion coefficient associated with warp propagation in this regime. If the viscosity is\nsmall enough that its effect on the unperturbed quantities can\nbe neglected, then the set of equations (36) can be extended\nto include the effect of a small viscosity by the replacement\n(Papaloizou & Lin 1995):\n!\n!\n\u2202\n\u2202\n+ i\u03a9K \u2192\n+ (i + \u03b1)\u03a9K .\n\u2202t\n\u2202t\n\n(37)\n\nIf the viscosity is large, however, then the complete viscous\nstress tensor should be included in the equations of motion,\nmaking the analysis rather complicated, since there would then\nbe accretion velocities in the unperturbed state.\n\n4.2. Setting up initial data\nA number of simulations using NIRVANA have been performed, in which warps with different amplitudes in discs with\ndifferent parameters were set up and allowed to evolve. We\ncompare these solutions with those obtained using the linear\ntheory expressed in Eqs. (36) using the same set of initial conditions. The linear calculations employed a one dimensional finite difference scheme for which we used 1000 equally spaced\ngrid cells.

Nelson: Warped Accretion Discs in Binary Star Systems\n\nFig. 2. Final stage of evolution for different sets of disc parameters. NIRVANA solution is shown by the solid blue line, the linear\ncalculation by the red dashed line.\nwith r MID = 5 to be centred in the middle of a disc with inner radius r = 1 and outer radius r = 9, the set of equations\n(36) was integrated forward in time. We chose the viscosity\nin these test simulations to be \u03b1 = 10\u22123 \u226a h since we are\nmainly interested in the regime of propagating bending waves,\nand because the linear solution presented here becomes invalid\nfor large viscosities. The NIRVANA code was set up in an inertial frame using the expressions (10) and (18) to specify the\ninitial density and velocity, in combination with Eq. (17), with\n\u03b3F (r) = \u03b4(r) now being the disc tilt which is a function of r. In\nthese simulations we used Nr = 404 cell in radius, 5 cells per\npressure scale height in the meridional direction (and different\nnumbers of vertical scale heights, depending on the initial warp\namplitude, as described below) and N\u03c6 = 300 cells in azimuth.\nWe used the same boundary condition as for the global simulations, which were described in section 3.1.\n\n4.3. Results\nAn example result is shown in Fig.1 which has a disc aspect ratio of h = 0.03 and maximum initial inclination angle\n\u03b4 MAX = 5\u25e6 . In this particular simulation the meridional domain\ncontains 15 pressure scale heights (\u2206\u03b8 = 12.89\u25e6) in total. Fig.1\nshows the inclination as a function of radius at different stages\nof the evolution. The solid blue line represents the NIRVANA\nsolution, while the red dashed line shows the linear calculation.\nMoving from the top left to top right panel, we can observe\nhow the initial pulse begins to broaden. At time t = 0.96 we\nsee that the pulse has separated into an in-going and out-going\n\nbending wave. By time t = 1.46 the pulses have reached the\nboundaries of the domain and have fully separated. It is clear\nthat NIRVANA is able to capture the evolution of these low\namplitude bending waves with a high level of accuracy.\nIn Nelson & Papaloizou (1999) the numerical SPH and linear solutions showed more substantial disagreement at the position of the initial pulse (r = 5) at the final stage of the simulation, with the separation of the two pulses not being captured as\naccurately. This was probably due to the larger numerical diffusion present in the SPH code, though it should be remembered\nthat the SPH simulations were performed using only 20,000\nparticles. The more accurate solution obtained with NIRVANA,\non the other hand, is a clear indication that the numerical diffusion is smaller.\nWe also performed simulations for other values of the disc\nthickness h and maximum initial inclination angle \u03b4 MAX . The\nnumber of pressure scale heights used in the meridional direction was scaled with the maximum inclination angle to avoid\nthe disc interacting with the meridional boundaries. The results\nare shown in Fig.2, and are presented at a stage of the simulations when the bending waves have propagated all the way\nto the radial boundaries. This corresponds to the final panel of\nFig.1. Since the bending waves propagate with half the sound\nspeed, the evolution occurs over a longer time in the thinner\ndiscs (h = 0.01), and over a shorter time in the thicker disc\nmodels (h = 0.05). As can be seen from Fig.2, the agreement\nbetween the numerical solution and the linear calculation is\ngood in all the models presented here. This is particularly the\ncase for those runs with lower initial maximum inclinations in\n\n\fM.M. Fragner & R.P. Nelson: Warped Accretion Discs in Binary Star Systems\n\nFig.2 (top left and right panels), but the results are still in very\nreasonable agreement for the higher inclination cases in Fig.2\n(lower left and right panels).\nWe mention here that for even higher inclination angles\nNIRVANA behaves more diffusively, and the agreement between the linear and non linear solutions gets worse. As found\nby (Nelson & Papaloizou 1999), when the warps become nonlinear they generate horizontal motions that are of the order\nof the sound speed, creating shocks because of the symmetric\nform of the initial bending disturbance. The result is an effectively higher viscosity operating in the disc, which is clearly\nnot accounted for in the linear calculations.\n\n5. Tilted discs in binary star systems\nWe now discuss our results for the misaligned, tidally interacting discs. We set up the disc models according to the procedure\noutlined in Sect. 3, and details of the model parameters can be\nfound in Table 1. The models are characterized by the disc aspect ratio, h, viscosity, \u03b1, and initial inclination with respect to\nthe binary orbit plane, \u03b3F . The disc outer edge, R, was chosen\nsuch that the disc is already very close to its tidal truncation\nradius, which is about one third of the distance between secondary and primary star, D. In some models the initial radius\nof the outer disc edge was varied also.\nIn this study, we are interested in examining the evolution of discs that fulfil the condition for wave-like warp propagation, h > \u03b1, as well as discs that support diffusive warp\npropagation, h < \u03b1. For the models in the wave regime we\nset \u03b1 = 12 h, and for the runs in the diffusive regime we set\n\u03b1 = 0.1 \u226b h.\nThe perturber is evolved on a circular orbit at a distance\nof D = 30, and its mass is increased linearly from zero up to\nMS = MP over a time interval of 4 orbits, during which time\nits distance is kept constant. Models 1 \u2013 5 were performed in\nthe precessing frame. If we use Eq. (15) to estimate the precession frequency, then we obtain a value of \u03a9F = \u22124.86 * cos(\u03b3F )\n[degrees/orbit]. We find, however, that a better fit to test simulations is given by \u03a9F = \u22123.74 * cos(\u03b3F ) [degrees/orbit], which\nis the value used in the simulations. The reason is that as the\ndisc gets tidally truncated it tends to precess slower, as can be\nseen from Eq. (15).\nThe resolution was chosen such there are 5 cells per pressure scale height in the meridional direction for all models.\nModels 1 and 3 incorporated 15 scale heights in the meridional\ndirection. Models 2, 4 and 5 used 22.5 scale heights (to allow\nfor a greater degree of twisting in the higher viscosity models where warp communication is expected to be less efficient).\nIn the radial and azimuthal directions we used Nr = 404 and\nN\u03c6 = 300 cells, respectively, for each of these models.\nModels 6 and 7 were performed in the non-precessing binary frame. Since the disc midplane is inclined with respect to\nthe equatorial plane of the computational grid in these simulations, higher resolutions are necessary to avoid numerical errors. This is particularly true in the azimuthal direction because\ntilting the disc causes a component of the disc vertical structure to point along this direction. For a disc whose midplane\ncoincides with the equatorial plane of the computational grid,\n\n9\n\npairwise cancelation of fluxes ensures conservation of angular\nmomentum to machine accuracy. However, if the disc midplane\nis inclined with respect to the equatorial plane of the computational grid, the accuracy is limited by the advection scheme,\nand higher resolution in the azimuthal direction becomes necessary to avoid unphysical evolution of precession and inclination angles. Hence we used 600 cells in azimuth. In order to\nbe able to resolve spiral waves for these extremely thin discs,\nwe used 1056 cells in radius. The disc outer edge was chosen\nto be a bit smaller than in the thick disc runs, since highly pronounced non linear effects at the outer edge were seen in lower\nresolution test simulations (described as Models 6a and 7a in\nTable 1). In effect a strongly perturbed and narrow outer rim of\ngas became partially detached from the main body of the disc\nand developed a very different inclination and precession angle\nevolution in Model 6a, an effect not observed in Model 6 with\na smaller initial outer radius. This phenomenon is discussed in\nmore detail later in the paper. In order to accommodate an inclined disc with an inclination of 10\u25e6 we used 60 pressure scale\nheights (\u223c \u00b117.03 degrees) in the meridional direction, with 5\ncells per pressure scale height.\nWe now describe the results of these models, where we\nhave ordered our discussion in terms of the disc aspect ratio,\nh.\n\n5.1. Models 1 and 2\nA column density plot for the disc in Model 1 is displayed in\nthe upper panels of Fig.3 corresponding to the end stage of\nthis simulation. The left panel displays a projection of the disc\ncolumn density onto the (e2 , e3 ) plane of the binary reference\nframe, and the right panel displays a projection onto the binary\n(e1 , e3 ) plane. At this stage the disc has precessed rigidly to\n\u03b2 = \u2212180 degrees, so the disc appears edge on in the (e2 , e3 )\nplane and face on in the (e1 , e3 ) plane. The precession of 180\ndegrees is evident, as the disc angular momentum vector now\nhas a negative e2 component, whereas it had a positive e2 component in its initial state, as can be seen from the transformation\ngiven by Eq. (8) at t = 0. Another result of the interaction with\nthe secondary star is the formation of spiral waves, which are\napparent in Fig.3.\nFig.4 shows the evolution of the precession (\u03b2) and inclination (\u03b4) angles, respectively, for disc material orbiting at different radii. These have been calculated using Eqs. (22) and (21)\nrespectively, where L has been calculated using Eq. (19), which\nwe have integrated over radial shells of width \u2206r = 1. Thus the\nred dashed line in Fig.4 corresponds to disc gas between r = 1\nand r = 2, the blue solid line to disc gas between r = 8 and\nr = 9, and the black dotted line to disc gas between r = 4 and\nr = 5. The solid black line shows the precession and inclination angles of the entire disc. It is apparent that the lines are almost indistinguishable in Fig.4 (upper left panel), showing that\nthe different disc parts in Model 1 precess at the same uniform\nrate, such that the disc is in a state of rigid body precession\nwith almost no twist. This behaviour is expected from linear\ntheory (Papaloizou & Terquem 1995). In Table 1 we show the\nwarp propagation timescale \u03c4W and the differential precession\n\n\f10\n\nM.M. Fragner & R.P.

The blue solid line corresponds to disc material between r = 8 and r = 9, the red dashed line to disc material between r = 1 and r = 2, and the black\ndotted line to disc material between r = 4 and r = 5. The black solid line represents the entire disc.\ntimescale, \u03c4P . In the bending wave propagation regime (h > \u03b1),\n\u03c4W = 2R/cS , since warps propagate with half the sound speed\nin this regime. In the diffusive regime (h < \u03b1) \u03c4W = 2\u03b12 R2 /\u03bd.\nThe warp propagation timescale should be compared to the differential precession timescale \u03c4P \u223c 2/\u03a9F . If \u03c4W < \u03c4P it is\nexpected that the disc will precess as a rigid body, while if\n\u03c4W > \u03c4P the disc may become disrupted as a result of differential precession. Hence, we see that the rigid precession of\nthe disc in Model 1 agrees with expectations. Our Model 1 is\nvery similar to Model 1 in Larwood et al. (1996), which also\nshows rigid body precession. The inferred precession period in\nour Model 1 is about 146 orbits, which is a little larger than the\nperiod given by Eq. (15). The difference arises because the disc\nis tidally truncated and shrinks slightly, so its precession rate\ndecreases.\nLooking at the upper right panel of Fig.4, we observe that\nthe inclination for Model 1 changes only slightly during the\nsimulation. The oscillation seen in the inclination rates is driven\nby the secondary star. Since the orbital plane is inclined with respect to the disc midplane, the vertical component of the gravitational force due to the secondary star causes the disc to perform a forced oscillation with a frequency equal to twice the binary frequency. Papaloizou & Terquem (1995) argued that the\ndisc is expected to align with the binary orbit on a time scale\nsimilar to that over which binary torques cause the total angular momentum of the disc to evolve. If the viscously-induced\noutward expansion of the disc is balanced by tides due to the\n\ncompanion, then disc-alignmnent should occur on the viscous\nevolution time, T \u03bd . For Model 1 we estimate T \u03bd = R2 /\u03bd \u223c 2175\norbits. Extrapolating the disc evolution shown in Fig. 4 gives\nan alignment time of \u223c 2025 orbits, in good agreement with\nthe viscous time scale.\nLubow & Ogilvie (2000) present images which represent\ndisc shapes for a variety of disc parameters, obtained using a\nlinear analysis of tilted discs in binary systems. They introduce\na parameter \u01eb, which is\u221a a measure of the disc thickness, and is\nroughly equivalent to 6H/R. Their model a displayed in their\nFigure 7 has H/R \u2243 0.041, \u03b1 = 0.01 and D/R = 0.3, similar to\nour model 1. Although a detailed comparison is not possible,\nit appears that there is general agreement between linear theory and our non-linear simulation, since both show almost no\ndistortion of the disc due to twisting or warping.\nColumn density plots for Model 2 are displayed in the\nlower panels of Fig.3. Warp propagation in this higher viscosity model (\u03b1 = 0.1) is expected to be diffusive, and therefore\nless efficient than for Model 1 (as shown by the warp propagation times listed in Table 1). This run was also evolved until\nthe precession angle reached -180 degrees. The high viscosity\noperating in the disc leads to the damping of the spiral waves\nbefore they can propagate very far, and thus they are not apparent in the images.\nThe precession angles for Model 2 are displayed in Fig.4\n(lower left panel). We observe that this more viscous disc develops a small differential twist before it attains a state of\n\n\f12\n\nM.M. Fragner & R.P. Nelson: Warped Accretion Discs in Binary Star Systems\n\nFig. 5.

The left panels correspond to projection onto the (e2 , e3 ) plane, the right panel to projection onto the (e1 , e3 ) plane.\nrigid precession. This suggests that the disc needs to develop\na slightly more distorted shape in order for internal stresses to\ncounterbalance the companion-induced differential precession\nwhen warp communication is less efficient. Nonetheless, rigid\nbody precession is expected in this case, and the numerical results are in agreement with this expectation.\n\nExamining the inclination evolution for Model 2 shown in\nthe lower right panel of Fig. 4, we see it is very similar to\nthat observed for Model 1. The viscous time scale in Model\n2 should be approximately 4 times shorter than for Model 1,\nbut there is no indication that the inclination evolution is faster\nin this case. We note that the inclination evolution rates do not\nappear to have reached final steady values for either Models 1\n\n\fM.M. Fragner & R.P. Nelson: Warped Accretion Discs in Binary Star Systems\n\nor 2 by the end of the simulations, such that an accurate assessment of the longer term evolution rate is not possible. This may\nbe because the outer disc radius has not had time to equilibrate\nduring the simulations as they have only run for a fraction of the\nglobal viscous timescale of the disc. We are able to conclude,\nhowever, that the inclination evolution occurs over timescales\nmuch longer than the precession time, and appears to be consistent with evolution on the global viscous time of the disc.\n\n5.2. Models 3, 4 and 5\nAs shown in Table 1, Models 3, 4 and 5 all have h = 0.03.\nModel 3 has \u03b1 = 0.015, and so warp propagation occurs via\nbending waves, whereas Models 4 and 5 have \u03b1 = 0.1 such that\nwarps propagate diffusively. Table 1 also shows that the warp\npropagation for Models 4 and 5 is expected to be considerably\nless efficient than for Model 3. Models 3 and 4 had inclinations\nof 45\u25e6 , whereas Model 5 had an inclination of 25\u25e6 , which induces a more rapid precession of the disc, and therefore has a\ngreater tendency to twist the disc up.\nAt the outset of this project it was our intention to run all\nmodels until they had precessed by 180\u25e6. For models 3 and\n4, however, we found that the discs become eccentric on a\ntimescale of approximately 60 orbits (16 binary orbits), leading to undesirable changes in the disc structure due to our use\nof an open inner boundary condition. Thus we did not evolve\nthese models until they had precessed by 180\u25e6. We note that the\ntimescale for the observed disc eccentricity growth corresponds\nclosely to that obtained by (Kley, Papaloizou & Ogilvie 2008).\nModel 5 did not suffer from this problem because the lower\ninclination angle induced more rapid precession, such that this\nmodel could be evolved until it had precessed by 180\u25e6 , but prior\nto growth of significant eccentricity. The study of disc eccentricity goes beyond the scope of this paper, but the results for\nmodels 3 and 4 suggest that very long term integrations may\nlead to the formation of inclined and eccentric discs. The fact\nthat we did not evolve models 3 and 4 through 180\u25e6 of precession means that the upper and middle panels of Fig.5 display\nimages which correspond to 90\u25e6 of precession.\nIt is clear from these panels that the disc in Model 3\nhas precessed as a rigid body, with almost no twist apparent.\nConsequently, after precessing through 90\u25e6 the disc appears\nedge on when projected into the (e1 , e3 ) plane and face on\nwhen projected into the (e2 , e3 ) plane. The middle right panel\nof Fig. 5, however, shows that the disc in Model 4 has developed a small twist due to the inner disc not having precessed\nby 90\u25e6 at the same moment when the outer disc has. The lower\npanels of Fig. 5 show column density plots for Model 5, which\nwas evolved until the outer disc had precessed by 180\u25e6 (assisted\nby the fact that the precession is faster in this case). It is apparent from these panels that the disc has developed a small twist\nsince the inner disc has not precessed a full 180\u25e6 by the end of\nthe simulation.\nThe precession angles for Model 3 are plotted in the top left\npanel of Fig. 6. The blue solid line corresponds to disc material\norbiting between radii r = 8 \u2013 9, the red dashed line radii between r = 1 \u2013 2, and the black dotted line to radii between r =\n\n13\n\n4 \u2013 5. A black solid line is also plotted showing the precession\nangle integrated over the whole disc. The fact that these lines\neffectively lie on top of each other shows that the disc precesses\nas a rigid body with essentially no twist. Rigid-body precession\nis expected in this case since the warp propagation time is less\nthan the differential precession time (see Table 1).\nThe inclination angles for Model 3 are plotted in the top\nright panel of Fig. 6. The line styles and colours correspond\nto the same disc annuli as described above. It is clear that the\ninclination evolution in this case is very slow. The global viscous evolution time for this disc is approximately 10,000 orbits,\nand a linear extrapolation of the inclination evolution shown in\nFig. 6 gives a time of \u223c 13500 orbits for the disc to fully align\nwith the binary orbit. Clearly the disc inclination is evolving on\nthe viscous time in this case.\nThe evolution of the precession angles for Model 4 are\nshown in the left middle panel of Fig 6. The line styles and\ncolours correspond to disc annuli as described above. We see\nthat this disc develops a well-defined twist which is set up\nwithin the first 5 \u2013 10 orbits due to the inner and outer parts of\nthe disc undergoing differential precession, with the outer disc\nprecessing faster than the inner disc. The magnitude of the twist\nis approximately 12\u25e6 . Thereafter the disc is seen to precess as\na rigid body, maintaining the same twisted shape. We note that\nthis disc is expected to achieve rigid body precession from consideration of the warp propagation and differential precession\ntimes (see Table 1).\nThe inclination angles for Model 4 are shown in the right\nmiddle panel of Fig. 6. We see that the disc in this case has developed a small warp, with the inner and outer discs having a\ndifference of inclination of about 1\u25e6 . We also observe that the\ninclination is evolving more rapidly than is the case for Model\n3. The global viscous evolution time for this disc is approximately 1500 orbits, and extrapolating the inclination evolution\nobserved in Fig. 6 gives an estimated time for alignment of\n\u223c 1000 orbits, close to the expected value.\nIt is interesting at this point to compare our results for\nModels 3 and 4 with Model 9 presented by Larwood et al.\n(1996), which had comparable parameters (h = 0.03, D/R = 3,\n45 degree inclination). Although it is difficult to know the precise value of the \u03b1 viscosity operating in the SPH simulations,\nit is likely that the effective \u03b1 value lies between the values\nused in our Model 3 (\u03b1 = 0.015) and Model 4 (\u03b1 = 0.1).\nNonetheless, we find qualitatively different behaviour, with our\nmodels quickly achieving a state of rigid body precession, with\na small twist and warp which vary smoothly across the disc.\nModel 9 of Larwood et al. (1996) shows significant disruption\nof the disc, which effective breaks discontinuously into two distincts parts which become mutually inclined by approximately\n25\u25e6 . The origin of this discrepancy is unclear, but one possibility is that SPH simulations using 20,000 particles are only\nmarginally able to resolve the vertical structure of a disc with\nh = 0.03. This may have the effect of reducing the efficacy of\nwarp propagation below that which is expected from consideration of the disc physical parameters.\nWe now turn to Model 5.

These have been\ncalculated using Eq. (38).\nto cos (\u03b3F ), the disc precesses faster in this simulation than in\nModels 1 \u2013 4, and this faster precession can be observed in\nFig. 6. The lower left panel of this figure shows the precession angles as a function of time for disc annuli located between r = 1 \u2013 2, r = 4 \u2013 5, and r = 8 \u2013 9, with the linestyles\nand colours being the same as described above. The larger\nprecession frequency induces greater differential precession in\nthe disc, and the consequence of this is that Model 5 shows\na slightly larger twist (15\u25e6 ) than Model 4 (12\u25e6). Also plotted\nin this panel are precession angles that would be observed if\nthe inner (black dashed-dotted line) and outer (black dashedtriple-dotted line) disc annuli precessed at their free particle\n\nrates given by (Papaloizou & Terquem 1995):\n3 GMS\n(3 cos2 \u03b4 \u2212 1).\n(38)\n8\u03a9K D3\nAs can be seen from the figure, the disc parts tend initially\ntowards their free particle rates, such that the outer disc precesses faster than the inner disc.

The emergence of internal stresses as the disc twists\nup is illustrated in Fig.7, where the different physical contributions to the precession rate are displayed for Model 5.

From the lower\n\nleft panel of Fig.7, we can observe that the gravitational interaction with the secondary causes a negative precession rate for\nthe outer annulus, and a positive precession rate for the inner\nannulus, and these rates correspond to the free particle precession rates. Since the frame in which these rates were measured\nprecesses in a retrograde sense with a mean frequency \u03a9F < 0,\nthis means that the inner annulus would lag behind while the\n\n\f16\n\nM.M. Fragner & R.P. Nelson: Warped Accretion Discs in Binary Star Systems\n\nshear motions are responsible for driving the bending disturbances, the viscosity will lead to weakened communication,\nand the redistribution of angular momentum due to radial advective fluxes shown in the upper left panel of Fig.7 will be suppressed. This effect is dominant and opposite to the one seen in\nthe upper right panel of Fig.7.\nThe inclination angles for Model 5 are shown in the lower\nright panel of Fig. 6. It is clear that the disc develops a small\nwarp, with the inner disc having \u223c 1\u25e6 higher inclination than\nthe outer disc. The rate of global inclination change is similar\nto that observed in Model 4, suggesting alignment of the disc\nin the global viscous evolution timescale.\n\nFig. 9.

Red dashed-dotted line: radial flux of angular momentum; blue dotted line: gravitational interaction with\nthe companion star; green dashed line: viscous friction between\nadjacent radial disc shells; black dashed-triple-dotted line: total\ninclination change rate.\n\nouter annulus would lead the precession of the reference frame,\nif the companion's gravity was the only contributor to the total precession rate. In fact, this is what is observed until about\nt = 10 orbits, during which time the disc precesses differentially (see Fig.6, lower left panel). As the disc starts to develop\na twist due to differential precession, misalignment of disc midplanes as a function of radius causes pressure forces to generate\nhorizontal shear motions that drive the propagation of bending\ndisturbances, and these communicate information about precession angle changes across the disc. The resulting internal\nstresses are clearly proportional to the degree of twisting, allowing the disc to achieve a state of rigid body precession once\na sufficiently twisted disc has been established. At this point the\ndisc structure becomes quasi-static in the precessing frame as\neach disc annulus precesses at the same rate. This sequence of\nevents is demonstrated by the upper left panel of Fig.7, which\nshows the contribution to the precession rate from the pressureinduced radial flux of angular momentum. After t = 10 orbits,\nthe contribution to the precession rate from the radial flux almost completely compensates the effect of gravity, such that\nthe total precession rate (relative to the precession of the reference frame) is zero for all disc annuli, as can be seen in the\nlower right panel of Fig.7, which shows the sum of the contributions to the precession rate. This demonstrates that the disc\nmanages to redistribute the angular momentum such that rigid\nbody precession is achieved. Once again we note that in this\nfigure we have subtracted the mean precession rate \u03a9F of the\nprecessing frame.\nThe effect of viscosity as calculated in Sect. 3.6 is depicted\nin the upper right panel of Fig.7. We observe that the effect\nof viscous friction between differentially precessing radially\nadjacent disc shells causes the disc to precess more rigidly.\nHowever, the dominant effect of the viscosity is the damping of\nthe horizontal shear motions induced by the twist. Since these\n\nWe plot the different physical contributions to the rate of\ninclination change for Model 5 in Fig.8. In Fig.9 we also display the time averaged contributions to the rate of inclination\nchange as a function of radius, where the time averaging was\nperformed over the full length of the simulation. As may be observed in the lower left panel of Fig.8, and even more clearly\nin Fig.9 (blue dotted line), the companion's gravity induces a\nglobally negative net inclination change, leading to coplanarity\nof the entire disc on the viscous time scale, in agreement with\nthe lower right panel of Fig.6. This is consistent with the findings of Papaloizou & Terquem (1995) that the zero-frequency\n(secular) gravitational interaction will lead to coplanarity. We\nnote that because of the time averaging, this is the dominant\ngravitational contribution that we pick up in Fig.9 (blue dotted\nline).\nMore interestingly, we can observe from the upper left\npanel of Fig.8, and in Fig.9 (red dashed-dotted line), that the\ncontribution from the radial fluxes not only counteracts the effect of gravity, it actually overshoots slightly, causing the inner\ndisc to become more inclined than the outer disc. This change\nof inclination is seen in the upper right panel of Fig.6. Thus the\ncommunication of bending disturbances on the one hand leads\nto rigid precession of the disc, and on the other hand causes the\ndisc to become slightly warped. Viscosity tends to reduce the\namount of warping, such that it acts to flatten the differential\ninclination profile across the disc radius, as can be seen from\nthe green dashed line in Fig.9. Thus the total average inclination rate in Fig.9 (dashed-triple-dotted line) is negative for the\nentire disc, while the magnitude is slightly bigger for the outer\ndisc, with the consequence that the disc has developed a slight\nwarp and tends to become coplanar with the orbital plane on\nthe viscous timescale, as seen in the lower right panel of Fig.6.\n\n5.3. Models 6 and 7\nWe now discuss Models 6 and 7, for which the discs have aspect ratio h = 0.01, an inclination angle of 10\u25e6 , and were performed in a non precessing frame. Model 6 has \u03b1 = 0.005,\nso warps propagate via bending waves in this case, and Model\n7 had \u03b1 = 0.1, so warps propagate diffusively in this model.\nWe see from Table 1 that differential precession is expected\nto disrupt the discs in Model 7, as the warp propagation time\nis longer than the differential precession time. Rigid-body precession is expected for Model 6.\n\n\fM.M. Fragner & R.P. Nelson: Warped Accretion Discs in Binary Star Systems\n\n17\n\nFig. 10. Column density plots for Model 6.

The solid black line represents the entire disc.\nColumn density plots showing the disc in Model 6 are presented in Fig.10 for different times during the evolution. The\ntop panels show the initial state of the disc. The disc appears\nedge on in the (e2 , e3 ) plane and face on in the (e1 , e3 ) plane.\nAs we move down to the next panels the outer edge of the disc\nhas precessed by 45 degrees at time t = 10.4, as can be seen\nin Fig.11 (upper left panel). The inner region of the disc, however, has only precessed by about 12 degrees at this stage and\nso appears almost edge-on in the left panel. In the third panels\ndown the outer disc has precessed by 90 degrees at t = 25.7\nand appears edge on in the (e1 , e3 ) plane and face on in the (e2 ,\ne3 ) plane. The inner disc has precessed by approximately 70\ndegrees by this time, and so does not appear edge-on in either\nprojections. The bottom panels show the disc structure at the\nfinal output of the simulation which was halted at t = 44 orbits,\nby which time the outer disc had precessed by approximately\n160\u25e6 .\nThe precession angles for Model 6 are shown in the upper\nleft panel of Fig. 11. The blue solid line corresponds to disc\nmaterial orbiting in an annulus between r = 7 \u2013 8, the black\ndotted line corresponds to the annulus between r = 4 \u2013 5, and\nthe red dashed line corresponds to the annulus between r = 1\n\u2013 2. As with Models 4 and 5, we see that the disc inner and\nouter annuli begin to precess at the local free-particle rates, and\nthe disc develops a significant twist which reaches a maximum\namplitude of approximately 30\u25e6 . As the disc becomes increasingly twisted, however, internal stresses are established which\n\ncause the inner disc precession rate to increase and the outer\ndisc precession rate to decrease. Eventually the disc reaches a\nstate of rigid body precession after a time of about 10 orbits.\nAfter this time we see that there is a long term readjustment of\nthe degree of twist such that by t = 44 orbits the twist angle has\nreduced from \u223c 30\u25e6 to \u223c 20\u25e6 .\nIn Fig. 12 we display the time integrated contributions to\nthe precession rate as a function of radius for Model 6, following the procedure described in Sect. 3.6. Note that the average\n(negative) precession rate of the disc has been subtracted in\nthis figure, such that a positive value corresponds to precession that will lag that of the overall disc, and a negative value\ncorresponds to precession that leads. The contribution from the\ncompanion's gravity is shown by the blue dotted line, and this\nis very similar to the free-particle precession rate which is plotted using the black solid line. The red dashed-dotted line shows\nthe contribution from the pressure-induced radial flux of angular momentum, and this is seen to almost exactly counterbalance the effect of gravity, showing that it is the pressureinduced radial motion in the disc which is responsible for halting the differential precession and inducing rigid body precession. The contribution from the disc viscosity is shown by the\ngreen dashed line, and is seen to be negligible.\nThe inclination angles for Model 6 are shown in the top\nright panel of Fig. 11, where the line styles and colours correspond to the disc annuli described above. As with Model 3,\nwe see that the disc develops a warp such that the inner disc\n\n\fM.M. Fragner & R.P. Nelson: Warped Accretion Discs in Binary Star Systems\n\n19\n\nFig. 13 shows the time integrated contributions to the rate\nof inclination evolution as a function of radius for Model 6.\nWe see that the companion's gravity causes the inclination to\ndecrease in the disc inner and outer regions, and in the inner regions the radial flux of angular momentum opposes this and increases the inclination during the simulation. Indeed the radial\nflux contribution causes the inclination angle to grow there, as\nobserved in the lower right panel of Fig. 11. The outer parts of\nthe disc experience negative contributions from both the companion's gravity and the pressure-induced radial flux, driving\nalignment of the disc on the relatively short timescale described\nabove. It is clear that the disc viscosity plays a negligible role\nin driving the inclination evolution (green dashed line).\n\nFig. 12. Average precession rates as function of radius for\nModel 6.

As discussed\npreviously, disc alignment is expected to occur on the viscous\ntime scale, which for Model 6 is approximately 3 \u00d7 105 orbits.\nIt is obvious from Fig. 11, however, that the disc in our simulation is not aligning on such a long time scale, but will actually\nalign within \u223c 650 orbits. Possible reasons for this enhanced\nalignment rate are discussed below.\n\nWe may compare our model 6 with model c in Figure 7 of\nLubow & Ogilvie (2000), which had H/R \u2243 0.012, \u03b1 = 0.01\nand D/R = 0.3. Detailed comparison between the results presented in Lubow & Ogilvie (2000) and our model 6 is not possible, but we note that there is general agreement in the prediction that a disc with H/R \u2243 0.01 and \u03b1 . H/R will show\nsignificant distortion due to twisting and warping. A detailed\ncomparison between our non linear simulation results and the\npredictions of linear theory will be presented in a future publication.\nWe now discuss the results from Model 7. In Fig.14 we display column density plots for this model. The top panels show\nthe initial state. The second panels down show the disc at time\nt = 20.5. At this stage the outer disc edge has precessed by 90\ndegrees and appears edge on in the (e1 , e3 ) plane, and face on\nin the (e2 , e3 ) plane. By contrast, the inner disc has not precessed very much and still appears almost edge on in the (e2 ,\ne3 ) plane and face on in the (e1 , e3 ) plane. At time t = 44 orbits\nthe outer disc has precessed by 180 degrees and appears edge\non in the (e2 , e3 ) plane and face on in the (e1 , e3 ) plane. The\ninner disc, however, has only precessed by about 70 degrees\nby this time, and so does not appear edge on in either projection. The bottom panels show the final stage of the simulation\nwhen the outer disc has precessed by about 220 degrees. It is\nclear from these images that the disc in Model 7 has adopted a\nhighly twisted shape, but one in which the precession angle for\ndifferent disc annuli varies very smoothly across the disc.\nThe precession angles for Model 7 are displayed in the\nlower left panel of Fig.11. We observe that the disc is in a state\nof differential precession at the end of the simulation, and the\ntwist between inner and outer disc annuli is approximately 110\ndegrees at this stage. Although this twist is large, the actual rate\nof differential precession at the end of the simulation is very\nsmall, as the precession rates of the inner and outer disc have\nconverged during the run. Indeed, extrapolation of the precession angles in Fig. 11 indicates that rigid body precession will\nbe achieved at a time equal to t = 56.6 orbits, at which point the\ntwist amplitude will be 111.7\u25e6. This suggests that even though\nthe warp propagation time is much smaller than the differential\nprecession time for Model 7 (see Table 1), internal stresses can\nbe set up within the disc that cause uniform precession once\nthe disc becomes highly twisted. Adopting a definition of disc\ndisruption which requires the twist to become greater than 180\ndegrees, we suggest that the disc in Model 7 will not be dis-\n\n\f20\n\nM.M. Fragner & R.P.

Diagram illustrating the alignment torques which arise\nin highly twisted discs, as discussed in the text.\nrupted, but will instead adopt a highly twisted but uniformly\nprecessing configuration.\nThe inclination angles for Model 7 are shown in the lower\nright panel of Fig. 11, where the lines styles correspond to the\ndisc annuli described above. We can see that the disc in this\ncase develops a small warp with the difference between the inclinations of the inner and outer disc being \u223c 1\u25e6 . We also note\nthat it appears that the integrated tilt of the whole disc is actually smaller than for any of the individual disc annuli, but\nthis is an effect of averging over a significantly twisted disc. As\nobserved for Model 6, we see that the inclination of the disc\nevolves rather quickly. The global viscous evolution time for\nModel 7 is \u223c 15000 orbits, whereas extrapolation of the inclination angles for either the inner or outer disc suggests that\nthey will completely align after \u223c 100 orbits.\nWhat is the explanation for this rapid alignment observed\nfor Models 6 and 7 ? One possibility that we have explored is\nthat numerical diffusion may cause a tilted disc to align with\nthe equatorial plane of the computational grid, since the advection routine does not conserve total angular momentum when\nthe disc azimuthal velocity is not directed along the azimuthal\ndirection of the computational grid. Lower resolution test calculations performed for a tilted disc without a companion indicate that this effect can cause eventual disc alignment, but at a\nrate which is at most 7 times smaller than observed in Models\n6 and 7. This suggests that numerical diffusion is not the cause\nof the rapid alignment.\nAnother possibilty arises when we consider the evolution\nof a rigidly precessing, tilted disc which is in a precessing reference frame whose precession frequency is equal to that of the\ndisc. Consider first the situation in which the angular momentum vectors for all disc annuli lie in the y \u2212 z plane of the binary\nframe initially (i.e. the z direction of the precessing frame lies\ninitially in the y \u2212 z plane of the binary frame, pointing along\nthe positive y and z directions). A torque exerted on disc annuli\nin the y direction, (a 'y-torque), will cause the disc inclination\nto change. A torque exerted in the x direction (an 'x-torque'),\nwill cause precession at a rate which differs from the precession rate of the frame. A positive x-torque causes precession\nto occur at a rate which is faster than the frame, and a negative x-torque causes slower precession. This general picture is\n\n21\n\nexpressed mathematically by Eqs. (34), and is shown diagramatically in the left hand image of Fig. 15. For a disc which\nprecesses uniformly without any twist, then the companion's\ngravity will exert positive x-torques on the outer disc annuli,\nand negative x-torques on the inner disc annuli, as it tries to\ncause the disc to precess differentially. Internal stresses, however, will exactly counterbalance these x-torques to maintain\nuniform precession. In this simple scenario there is no torque\nexerted on the disc in the y direction to modify its inclination.\nConsider now the case of a highly twisted disc which is being forced to precess uniformly, and whose annuli all have the\nsame inclination. Gravity will again try to induce differential\nprecession, but now the torque exerted on disc annuli will have\nboth an x and a y component due to the twist. Resolving the\nvectors associated with the internal stresses required to enforce\nuniform precession shows that their combined x-torques operate in opposite directions such that they cancel when integrated\nover the disc. The combined y-torques, however, operate in the\nsame direction, implying that the internal torques generate a net\ny-torque on the disc. Conservation of angular momentum obviously prohibits this from arising, suggesting that a y-torque\nmust operate, whose effect is to change the disc inclination.\nThis is shown diagramatically in the right panel of Fig. 15.\nGiven that the internal torques are operating on the precession\ntimescale in order to maintain uniform precession, this argument suggests that a highly twisted disc may align on the precession time, as is observed for Models 6 and 7. Interestingly,\nthe resultant y-torque that arises in this picture is proportional\nto sin (\u2206\u03b2), where \u2206\u03b2 is the twist amplitude, and the rate of inclination evolution observed in Models 6 and 7 is in agreement\nwith this scaling.\nIf the above argument is correct, then it suggests that discs\nwith modest levels of twist will align on the global viscous\ntimescale of the disc, but highly twisted discs may align on\nthe much shorter precession timescale. This obviously has significant implications for astrophysical systems which may be\nexpected to harbour highly twisted discs, such as the X-ray binaries Her X-1 and SS433.\n\n5.3.1. Models 6a and 7a - broken or disrupted discs ?\nWe now briefly discuss the results of two lower resolution models which were run during an early stage of this project: Models\n6a and 7a. These were identical to Models 6 and 7 except that\nthe number of grid cells in the radial direction was Nr = 300,\nand the disc outer radii were located at R = 10 instead of R = 8.\nExtending the disc radius outward has the potential effect of increasing the rate of differential precession across the disc, provided that tidal truncation does not cause the disc to shrink back\ndown to R = 8.\nColumn density plots for Model 6a are shown in the top\ntwo panels of Fig. 16, corresponding to an evolution time of\nt = 22.8 orbits. We can see that there has been some tidal truncation of this disc, and the outer disc edge is significantly distorted in the images. This arises because a narrow outer rim,\nrunning between radii r \u223c 7 and r \u223c 10, has effectively detached itself from the main body of the disc, and has evolved\n\n\f22\n\nM.M.

The solid blue line corresponds to\nthe disc annulus lying between r = 9 \u2013 10, and there are two additional blue dotted lines for annuli lying between r = 7 \u2013 8 and\nr = 8 \u2013 9. It is clear that the disc has separated into two parts\ndiscontinously at a radius between r = 7 and r = 8, with the\ndetached outer rim having precessed significantly faster than\nthe inner disc. The inclination angles plotted in the upper right\npanel show that the disc becomes significantly warped, with\n\nthe outer rim tending to align with the binary and the inner\ndisc actually increasing its inclination. Although the change in\ninclination appears to occur fairly smoothly across the disc, it\nshould be noted that the disc has developed a fairly large warp\nof 5\u25e6 .\nThe behaviour of Model 6a is reminiscent of the broken\ndisc presented by Larwood et al. (1996) (their broken Model 9\nhad h = 0.03, inclination of 45\u25e6 , D/R = 3) except that the discontinuous break in Model 6a occurs near to the edge of the\ndisc. It would appear that Model 6a breaks because the larger\ndisc radius induces a larger rate of differential precession, and\nalso possibly because warp propagation is retarded in the outer\ndisc regions which are subject to non linear density structures\nand shocks because of strong interaction with the binary companion.\n\n\fM.M.

By the end of the simulation\nthe twist amplitude is \u223c 170\u25e6, and the precession rates of inner\nand outer disc remain very different such that this disc will differentially precess through 180\u25e6. So, by our working definition\nof disc disruption, this disc will be disrupted because of differential precession. The inclination angles show that the disc also\nbecomes significantly warped, with the outer disc aligning with\nthe binary orbit more rapidly than the inner disc.\nTo summarise: Model 6a and 7a both show examples of\ndiscs which break or are disrupted because of differential precession. In the case where warps propagate via bending waves,\nthe disc breaks discontinuously into two independently precessing parts, but which themselves remain as coherent structures which precess as rigid bodies. In the case where warps\npropagate diffusively, viscosity is able to smooth out any discontinuous behaviour, and instead the disc becomes disrupted\nbecause the twist exceeds 180 degrees. In all probability the\ndisc annuli in Model 7a will continue to precess differentially in\nthe longer term, substantially destroying any coherent disc-like\nstructure. The larger disc radius in this case, when compared\nwith Model 7, causes the differential precession rate across the\ndisc to be larger, and thus explains why Model 7a shows dis-\n\nruption, whereas Model 7 results in a highly twisted disc which\nis able to attain a state of rigid-body precession.\n\n6. Conclusions\nWe have presented non linear simulations of accretion discs\nin close binary systems in which the binary midplane is misaligned from the binary orbital plane. Previous work on this\nproblem, which employed linear theory, semi-analytic techniques and SPH simulations (Papaloizou & Terquem 1995;\nLarwood et al. 1996; Lubow & Ogilvie 2000), suggests that\nunder suitable conditions the disc should become mildly\nwarped and precess as a rigid-body around the angular momentum vector of the binary system. The main aim of the present\nstudy is to examine in detail the structure and evolution of\ndiscs in misaligned binary systems, subject to variation of the\nimportant physical parameters. We used the grid-based code\nNIRVANA to perform the numerical simulations, and in principle this should have the advantage over previous SPH simulation studies that the disc viscosity is a well defined and controllable parameter.\nFollowing Nelson & Papaloizou (1999), the propagation of\nlinear bending waves was used as a means to calibrate the code\nand test its ability to propagate warps. Direct comparison with\nlinear calculations show that the code can propagate bending\nwaves with a high degree of accuracy for a range of disc models\nand warp perturbation amplitudes.\nIn our study of discs in misaligned binary systems, a number of different models were considered. Discs with aspect ratios h = 0.05, 0.03 and 0.01 were studied, and for each of\nthese values models were computed with viscosity parameters\n\u03b1 = h/2 and \u03b1 = 0.1. The smaller value of \u03b1 allows bending\n\n\f24\n\nM.M. Fragner & R.P. Nelson: Warped Accretion Discs in Binary Star Systems\n\nwaves to propagate, whereas the larger value causes warps to\nevolve diffusively.\nIt is expected that discs for which the warp propagation\ntime, \u03c4W , is shorter than the differential precession time, \u03c4P ,\nwill undergo rigid-body precession. Discs which do not satisfy\nthis criterion may be disrupted by strong differential precession. All our models with h = 0.05 and 0.03 have \u03c4W < \u03c4P , and\nthe simulations show that each of these discs attains a state of\nrigid-body precession. Discs with lower viscosity maintained a\nprecessing structure with almost no discernible twist and warp,\ndue to the highly efficient warp propagation associated with\nbending waves. Discs with larger viscosity propagate warps\nless efficiently, and these models underwent a short period of\ndifferential precession, setting up a twist in the disc, prior to\nattaining a state of rigid-body precession. Our analysis shows\nthat internal stresses are established in the disc as it becomes\ntwisted, which transport angular momentum across its radius\nand cause it to precess rigidly. Models in which warp propagation is the least efficient develop the largest twist, since the internal stresses which hold the disc together against differential\nprecession are proportional to the twist amplitude. Examination\nof the simulations shows that the dominant contributor to these\ninternal stresses are pressure-induced radial angular momentum fluxes which are driven by local misalignment of disc midplanes. When \u03b1 = 0.1, the final amplitude of the twist was just\na few degrees for the h = 0.05 disc, and for the h = 0.03 disc it\nwas between 12 \u2013 15 degrees, depending on the binary inclination. The low viscosity models showed essentially no twist.\nIn addition to becoming twisted, a disc may also become\nwarped. We find that for all models with h = 0.05 and h = 0.03\nthe degree of warping is very modest, with differences in inclination across all disc annuli being less than 1 degree. It is\nexpected that these discs will also align with the binary orbital plane on the global viscous evolution time of the disc\n(Papaloizou & Terquem 1995; Larwood et al. 1996), and all\nsimulations with h = 0.05 and 0.03 are fully consistent with\nthis expectation.\nWe also considered a number of thin disc models with\nh = 0.01, where we not only varied the viscosity but also the\nouter radius (taking values of either R = 8 or R = 10). The\nlow viscosity model with R = 8 developed a significant twist\nof between 20 \u2013 30\u25e6 before achieving a state of solid body precession, as expected since \u03c4W < \u03c4P for this model. A model\nrun with \u03b1 = 0.1 and R = 8 was predicted to be disrupted due\nto differential precession since \u03c4W > \u03c4P in this case. During\nthe simulation it developed a very large twist \u223c 110\u25e6, but as the\ndisc become increasingly twisted the rate of differential precession decreased. At the end of the run the disc was experiencing\nvery slow differential precession, and extrapolation of the rate\nof twisting indicates that this disc will achieve rigid-body precession with a twist of \u223c 112\u25e6. This is the first indication in\nour results that a disc which is predicted to be disrupted can\nnonetheless generate internal stresses to enforce rigid precession when the degree of twist becomes large.\nModels with h = 0.01 and R = 10 showed different behaviour, largely as a result of the larger precession rate which\nis induced for a larger disc, and suggest that the models run\nwith R = 8 had outer radii slightly smaller than the natural\n\ntidal truncation radius. The disc with \u03b1 = h/2, which supports\nbending waves, was observed to undergo modest tidal truncation and to break into two distinct disc parts which precessed\nindependently of one another, an outcome which is similar to\none obtained using an SPH simulation by Larwood et al. (1996)\nbut for a disc with somewhat different parameters. A narrow\nrim at the edge of the disc, running between radii r = 7 \u2013 10,\ndetached from the interior disc and precessed independently at\na faster rate. The inner disc part precessed at a rate similar to\nthat observed in the R = 8 case. Interestingly we estimate that\n\u03c4W > \u03c4P for this larger disc model, such that the breaking of\nthe disc is indeed expected.\nThe model with \u03b1 = 0.1 propagates warps diffusively, and\nwas observed to differentially precess through 180 degrees, but\nmaintained a very smooth twist profile throughout the simulation. This disc is clearly disrupted through strong differential\nprecession, and the internal stresses are insufficient for the disc\nto achieve rigid-body precession. Over longer times this disc\nshould become completely twisted up by differential precession such that it loses all semblance of a disc-like structure.\nThe results for the R = 10 discs are interesting, as they\nindicate two different modes by which a disc may break or be\ndisrupted. In the bending wave regime, our results suggest that\ndisc disruption may occur via a discontinuous change in the\nprecession rate at a particular radius, such that the disc breaks\ninto two distinct pieces which precess independently. Within\neach separate disc-piece warp communication allows for rigidbody precession. The detachment of the disc outer rim may in\npart be influenced by the strong tidal interaction there, since\nnon linear features and shocks may have the effect of reducing\nthe efficacy of warp communication. In the diffusion regime, it\nappears that viscosity is able to smooth out any discontinuities,\nand the disc is disrupted through global differential precession\nof the disc annuli, with a smooth twist profile being maintained\nacross the disc radius.\nA significant result obtained for the h = 0.01 models\nis that these highly twisted discs align with the binary orbit\nplane much more quickly than the thicker discs, which align\non the viscous timescale. Although we find that numerical diffusion can cause an inclined disc to align with the equatorial\nplane of the computational domain, this occurs on much longer\ntimescales than are observed. We tentatively suggest that alignment of highly twisted discs occurs on the precession time\nrather than the viscous time, causing rapid alignment of very\nthin discs.\nWe have not considered different binary mass ratios, instead\nwe restricted our study to the case of an equal mass binary.\nAs Eqs. (38) and (15) indicate, the free and mean precession\nrates scale linearly with the companion mass for a disc of fixed\nouter radius. Hence we would expect the differential precession\ntimescale \u03c4P to be increased for less massive binary companions, and consequently the differential twist observed in our\nmodels should be reduced in such systems.\nOur work has a number of astrophysical implications. Most\nT Tauri stars are members of binary or multiple systems, and in\na number of these it is believed that the disc and orbit planes are\nmisaligned. One particular system for which there is a resolved\nimage of a disc which is misaligned from the binary plane is\n\n\fM.M. Fragner & R.P. Nelson: Warped Accretion Discs in Binary Star Systems\n\nHK Tau (Stapelfeldt et al. 1998). In this system, the disc radius\nis estimated to be 105 AU, and the projected binary separation\nis approximately 3 times larger than this, suggesting that the\ndisc may be tidally truncated and undergoing strong interaction with the inclined companion star. The images do not show\nany signs that the disc is warped, which is consistent with our\nh = 0.05 models, whose aspect ratio is probably appropriate\nfor T Tauri discs. Evidence for misaligned young binaries is\nalso provided by observations of precessing jets in star forming regions Terquem et al. (1999). In one particular example,\nBally & Devine (1994) suggest that the jet which appears to\nbe launched by the young stellar object HH43* in the L1641\nmolecular cloud in Orion precesses with a period of about 104\nyears. Applying models to a disc with outer edge of 50 AU surrounding a solar type star, the rigidly precessing disc models\npresented in this work precess with a period of between 3.5 \u2013\n5 \u00d7 104 years, depending on the inclination angle considered.\nThus the observed precession is consistent with that driven by\na binary companion, with parameters close to those adopted\nin this work. The long alignment timescales that we find for\nh = 0.05 discs suggests that a T Tauri disc will remain misaligned throughout its lifetime, such that jets launched from\nthe disc inner regions will continue to precess for the duration\nof the time when jet launching is active.\nThe thin h = 0.01 disc models that we have computed are\nmost likely relevant to discs in X-ray binaries. The X-ray binary systems SS433 Margon (1984) and Her X-1 Boynton et al.\n(1980) are two examples of systems thought to contain precessing discs, with the evidence provided by the precessing\njet of SS433 being particularly compelling. It is likely that\nthe transfer of matter between the donor star and compact object in these systems will cause disc material to lie in the binary orbit plane initially, and a tilting mechanism is required\nto move the disc out of this plane, such as the BardeenPetterson effect (Bardeen & Petterson 1975), a misaligned\ndipole magnetic field associated with the central neutron star\n(Terquem & Papaloizou 2000), a disc wind (Schandl & Meyer\n1994) or radiation pressure (Iping & Petterson 1990; Pringle\n1996). If our results on the rapid realignment of highly twisted\ndiscs are correct, then this implies that a strong tilting mechanism which operates on short timescales will be required to\nmaintain a misaligned disc which can be observed to precess.\nFinally, we briefly consider the implications of our results\nfor the formation of planets in misaligned binary systems. The\nearly stages of planet formation are believed to involve the\ngrowth of planetesimals via mutual collisions. As the planetesimals grow in size, their interaction with the disc through\ngas drag forces will decrease. Planetesimals orbiting at different radii will have their own precession frequencies, likely to\nbe different to that of the disc. Consequently, the growth of\nthe planetesimals will eventually cause them to develop orbits\nwhich are increasingly inclined to the disc midplane. The effect\nof this is likely to be an increase in relative motion between\nplanetesimals, which will affect the outcomes of mutual collisions, and the rate at which planetary growth proceeds. A detailed examination of these issues will be presented in a forthcoming paper.\n\n25\n\nReferences\nArtymowicz P., Lubow S.H., 1994, ApJ, 421, 651\nBally J., Debine D., 1994, ApJ, 428, L65\nBardeen J.M., Petterson J.A., 1975, ApJ, 195, L65\nBoynton, P.
