Introduction\nIn a conventional BCS theory, the normal state has a Fermi surface common to both\nspin-up and spin-down electrons and the Cooper pair has a zero total momentum. More\nthan forty years ago, Fulde and Ferrell[1](FF), Larkin and Ovchinnikov[2] (LO) proposed\nindependently the pairing mechanism for the mismatched Fermi surfaces due to the spin\nimbalance. In the FF state, a spin up electron with momentum ~k is bounded with a spin\ndown electron with momentum \u2212~k + ~q, thereby the Cooper pair has a net momentum\n~q which is determined by the imbalance between two Fermi surfaces. Therefore the\norder parameter is characterized by a single momentum ~q, which can be written as\n\u2206(~r) = \u22060 ei~q*~r with a uniform magnitude \u22060 . If considering the composition of two\nmomenta, ~q and \u2212~q, one gets the LO state where the order parameter is real with its\nmagnitude oscillating periodically in space.\nIn condensed matter physics, the spin imbalance can be generated by applied\nmagnetic fields. However the condition for the FFLO state to be observed is\nquite stringent on the superconducting materials. Roughly speaking, there are three\nrequirements (i) low Tc , so that the magnetic field needed to imbalance the spin\npopulation is accessible; (ii) the orbital effect of magnetic field is weak enough to\navoid pair breaking before the Zeeman splitting takes effect; (iii) clean limit, i.e., the\nmean free path of electron should be much longer than the correlation length, since the\nFFLO state is easily destroyed by impurities. Some of heavy fermion superconductors\nare good candidates to fulfill these requirements (for a review see Ref. [3]). There\nwas recent indications that CeCoIn5 indeed exhibits the FFLO state[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9].\nThat compound is a quasi-two-dimensional heavy fermion superconductor with a dwave pairing. In the cold fermionic atom system with different hyperfine spins, the\nspin population imbalance between different hyperfine spins can be easily controlled\nby applying radio frequency field. Recently the imbalanced superfluid state has been\nrealized in these cold neutral atom systems [10, 11, 12, 13, 14], and the possible spatially\nmodulated superfluid phases in these systems are studied in Ref. [15, 16]. It is noted that\nthe particle number of different species may be controlled directly in systems like cold\natoms, and in superconductors the spin imbalance is generated by the external magnetic\nfields, which may correspond to two different thermodynamic conditions, respectively.\nIn a recent theoretical study [17], it was found that in the harmonically trapped\npolarized fermionic atoms in a two-dimensional (2D) optical lattice, the insulating core\nis surrounded by a superfluid shell at high atom densities with pairing parameter\nmodulated in the circumferential direction. Since some of important physics may be\nexplained by the quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) shell, it is thus interesting to study\nfurther the FFLO with more details in a quasi-1D system. The possible angular FFLO\nstate in a toroidal trap has also been investigated in a very recent study [18]. In the\npresent paper, we consider a quasi-1D annular disk with narrow enough radial width,\nso that the radial modulation of the order parameter might result in a quite large radial\ngradient of order parameter which increases the system energy considerably according\n\n\fImbalanced superfluid state in an annular disk\n\n3\n\nto the Ginzburg Landau(GL) theory. Therefore the oscillation of pairing amplitude is\nsuppressed in radial direction, and restricted only in circumferential direction. In a\nlarge 2D system, the order parameter oscillation has more freedom and can happen in\narbitrary directions. In the presence of inhomogeneity the modulation direction may\nvary in space which leads to irregular pattern of order parameter. Therefore it may be\neasier to observe regular oscillations of the pairing amplitude in a quasi-1D system than\nin the 2D film.\nIn this paper, we consider two distinct systems. The first one may be relevant\nto heavy fermion superconductors, where the electrons spins interact with an external\nmagnetic field via the Zeeman coupling. The second system may be related to the\ncold fermionic atoms, where the number of fermions of each spin is fixed. We employ a\ngrand canonical ensemble to study the first system and a canonical ensemble to study the\nsecond system. We solve the Bogoliubov-de-Gennes (BdG) equation at zero temperature\nnumerically for the above quasi-1D systems. Our main results can be summarized\nbelow. In the first case, as the magnetic field increases, the ground state is transformed\nfrom a uniform superfluid state to the sinusoidally modulated LO state, and then to\na spin polarized normal state. In the second case, the ground state depends on the\npairing strength. For weak interactions, the order parameter exhibits a periodic domain\nwall lattice pattern with a localized spin distribution for low spin imbalance, and a\nsinusoidally modulated pattern with extended spin distribution for high spin imbalance.\nFor strong interactions, the phase separation between superfluid state and polarized\nnormal state is found to be more preferable, while increase of spin imbalance simply\nextends the spatial region of the normal state. The paper is organized as follows. In\nSec. II, we study the exact 1D case. In Sec. III, we present our results for annular disk\ngeometry. The conclusion is given in Sec. IV.\n2. Imbalanced Superfluid State in One-dimensional Ring\n2.1. One-dimensional BdG Equation\nBefore exploring the properties of imbalanced superfluid in the annular disk geometry,\nwe first consider the 1D ring, which may be viewed as the limiting case where the\ndisk width is so narrow that only one radial mode is relevant. This case has been\nstudied by a number of authors. In the mean field(MF) level, a rigorous analysis for\nthe 1D BdG equation is given in Ref. [19] in the presence of a magnetic field. In terms\nof 1D Luttinger liquid theory the imbalanced superconducting state is also elucidated\nby Yang [20], and very recently, the density matrix renormalization group algorithms\nare implemented on the 1D negative-U Hubbard model to explore the FFLO state in\nRefs. [21, 22, 23, 24]. The cold fermionic gases with attractive interaction and population\nimbalance are studied theoretically in Ref. [25] and and Ref. [26].\nIn this subsection, we follow the MF treatment to give a brief description to the\n1D imbalanced superfluid state. We consider a canonical ensemble and fix the number\n\n\fImbalanced superfluid state in an annular disk\n\n4\n\nof fermions of different species. Although only the quasi-long range order may exist\nin 1D system, the MF approach presented in this section is helpful to understand the\nimbalanced superfluid in 2D annular disk geometry shown in later sections.\nThe mean field Hamiltonian for a 1D interacting system reads\n\u0012 2 2\u0013\nZ\nX\n~ \u2202x\n\u2020\n\u03c8\u0302\u03b1 (x)\n\u0124\n=\ndx[\n\u03c8\u0302\u03b1 (x) \u2212\n2m\n\u03b1\n\u0010\n\u0011 |\u2206(x)|2\n+ \u2206(x)\u03c8\u0302\u2191\u2020 (x)\u03c8\u0302\u2193\u2020 (x) + h.c. \u2212\n]\ng\nZ\nX\n\u2212\n\u03bc\u03b1 [ dx\u03c8\u0302\u03b1\u2020 (x)\u03c8\u0302\u03b1 (x) \u2212 N\u03b1 ]\n\u03b1\n\nD\n\n\u2206(x) = g \u03c8\u0302\u2193 (x)\u03c8\u0302\u2191 (x)\n\nE\n\n.\n\n(1)\n\n\u03c8\u0302\u03b1 (x) is the fermion annihilation field at position x with spin index \u03b1, \u2206(x) is the\nfermion pairing field, m is the mass of the particle, and g < 0 is the attractive interaction\nstrength. \u03bc\u03b1 are the Lagrangian multipliers or the chemical potentials, which are used\nto fix the numbers of fermions of different spins at N\u2191 and N\u2193 , respectively.\nEq. (1) has the similar form to the well known Su-Schrieffer-Heeger(SSH) model\n[27] for polyacetylene, which describes a 1D electron system coupled to phonons. In\nthis system, when the phonon fields are condensed in opposite phases at the two ends\nof the 1D string, there are possible soliton excitations with zero energy in the fermion\nspectrum. The soliton excitations are also possible in the 1D superfluid Hamiltonian\nEq. (1), where the MF pairing parameter \u2206(x) can mimic the phonon field in the SSH\nmodel, which is shown briefly below. More details can be found, e.g., in Ref. [19]. For\n\u221a\nsimplicity we take \u03bc\u2191 = \u03bc\u2193 = \u03bc, which determines the Fermi momentum kF = 2m\u03bc/~.\nThe low energy physics is described by quasiparticles around the two Fermi points \u00b1kF ,\ni.e., the following decomposition is allowed\n\u03c8\u0302\u03c3 (x) \u223c eikF x R\u0302\u03c3 (x) + e\u2212ikF x L\u0302\u03c3 (x)\nwith left and right movers defined as\nX\neikx\n\u03c8\u0302\u03c3 (k + kF ) \u221a\nR\u0302\u03c3 (x) =\nL\n\u2212\u039b<k<\u039b\nX\neikx\n\u03c8\u0302\u03c3 (k \u2212 kF ) \u221a .\nL\u0302\u03c3 (x) =\nL\n\u2212\u039b<k<\u039b\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\n\u039b is a suitable momentum cutoff. These quasiparticle operators satisfy the standard\nanti-commutation relations, i.e.,\n{R\u0302\u03c3 , R\u0302\u03c3\u2020 \u2032 } = {L\u0302\u03c3 , L\u0302\u2020\u03c3\u2032 } = \u03b4\u03c3,\u03c3\u2032\nand all the other anti-commutators are zero. Substituting Eq. 2 into Eq. 1, and\nneglecting the fast oscillation terms (\u221d exp(\u00b12ikF x)), one obtains the following two\nHamiltonians to the linear order of k,\nZ\n\u01241 = ~vF dx : R\u0302\u2191\u2020 (\u2212i\u2202x )R\u0302\u2191 : \u2212 : L\u0302\u2020\u2193 (\u2212i\u2202x )L\u0302\u2193 :\n\n\fImbalanced superfluid state in an annular disk\nZ\n+ dx\u2206(x)(R\u0302\u2191\u2020 L\u0302\u2020\u2193 + L\u0302\u2193 R\u0302\u2191 )\nZ\n\u01242 = ~vF dx : R\u0302\u2193\u2020 (\u2212i\u2202x )R\u0302\u2193 : \u2212 : L\u0302\u2020\u2191 (\u2212i\u2202x )L\u0302\u2191 :\nZ\n+ dx\u2206(x)(L\u0302\u2020\u2191 R\u0302\u2193\u2020 + R\u0302\u2193 L\u0302\u2191 ) .\n\n5\n\n(4)\n\nHere : A : denotes normal ordering of A and vF means the positive Fermi velocity.

Eq. 5 shows that the pairing takes\nplace either between L\u0302\u2191 and R\u0302\u2193 , or between L\u0302\u2193 and R\u0302\u2191 . Actually, hR\u2193 L\u2191 i = hL\u2193 R\u2191 i by\nR\nsymmetry. Formally, one may have \u0124 \u223c \u01241 + \u01242 \u2212 dx|\u2206(x)|2 /g, but it is emphasized\nthat \u01241,2 only describe the low energy excitations near the Fermi surface.\nLet's consider only H1 with a twisted \u2206(x), i.e., \u2206(\u2212\u221e) = \u2212\u2206(\u221e) = \u22060 . As\nshown by Jackiw and Rebbi[28], there is at least one zero mode \u03b3\u03020\u2191 in the middle of the\ngap, which is localized in space and reads\nZ\n\u03b3\u03020\u2191 \u221d dxF (x)[R\u0302\u2191 (x) \u2212 iL\u0302\u2020\u2193 (x)]\n\u0014Z x\n\u0015\n\u2032\n\u2032\nF (x) \u221d exp\ndx \u2206(x )\n(6)\n0\n\nIt is easy to verify the commutation relation [\u03b3\u03020\u2191 , \u01241 ] = 0. Besides this localized zero\nmode, we also have other quasiparticle excitations \u03b3\u0302n\u03b1 in the continuum region, where n\nand \u03b1 are the energy level and spin indices, respectively. Assuming all of them constitute\na complete representation of the Hamiltonian H1 , the lowest energy states are doubly\ndegenerate in the presence of an order parameter with kink pattern, which is the spinless\nvacuum of the quasiparticles \u03b3\u0302n\u03b1 together with the zero mode \u03b3\u03020\u2191 being either filled or\nempty. Similar analysis is also valid for the H2 branch, for which one can find that the\nzero mode has the form\nZ\n\u03b3\u03020\u2193 \u221d dxF (x)[R\u0302\u2193 (x) + iL\u0302\u2020\u2191 (x)]\nwhich satisfies [\u03b30\u2193 , H2 ] = 0.\nIn terms of R\u0302\u03c3 and L\u0302\u03c3 , the total particle number N\u0302 and total spin operator \u015c can\nbe written as\nN\u0302 = N\u0302\u2191 + N\u0302\u2193 ,\n\u015c = N\u0302\u2191 \u2212 N\u0302\u2193\nZ\nN\u0302\u03c3 = dx[: R\u0302\u03c3\u2020 R\u0302\u03c3 : + : L\u0302\u2020\u03c3 L\u0302\u03c3 :] ,\n\nwhere the fast oscillating terms are neglected. Note that the quasiparticle operators R\u0302\u03c3\nand L\u0302\u03c3 can only describe the low energy physics, hence the operator N\u0302\u03c3 with normal\nordering only measures the particle number relative to the Fermi surface. Obviously,\nunlike the SSH model[27] and the Jackiw-Rebbi model[28], the charge conservation is\n\n\f6\n\nImbalanced superfluid state in an annular disk\n\nbroken in the BCS theory, therefore one can not tell how many charges the soliton can\ncarry. Despite this fact, the total spin is still a conserved quantity in our MF treatment,\ntherefore each zero mode may carry half spin as an analog to the half charge investigated\nin Ref.[27, 28]. But in practice only one spin can be observed at the kink of \u2206(x), since\nthere are two branches of fermions(H1 and H2 ). To observe the half spin, one must\nget rid of the fermion doubling problem. Nevertheless, this provides a mechanism to\naccommodate excess spins with zero energy. The total energy of the soliton measured\nrelative to the uniform BCS state is computed to be 2\u22060 /\u03c0[29, 30], which is less than\nthe superfluid gap.\n2.2. From Soliton Lattice-like LO state to sinusoidally-varying LO State\nFor equally populated species N\u2191 = N\u2193 , the lowest energy state is obviously the BCS\nstate with uniform pairing gap. If one spin is flipped from downward to upward, i.e.,\nN\u2191 + 1 up spin and N\u2193 \u2212 1 down spin, a pair of soliton and anti-soliton is developed\nto store these two excess spins. We define the spin imbalance n to be (N\u2191 \u2212 N\u2193 )/2 for\nspin 1/2 particle. A typical soliton and anti-soliton pair is plotted in Fig. (1a), which\nis obtained by numerically solving Eq. (1) in a ring, where we use the angle \u03b8 = 2\u03c0x/L\nas the coordinate. Due to the periodic boundary condition, a single soliton can not\nexist freely so that it must co-exist with an anti-soliton as a pair with the same width\n\u03be. We call these soliton states with each spin per soliton (anti-soliton) as ideal soliton\nstate. Note that since the order parameter is real, this state is also a kind of LO state.\nActually, all the self-consistent solutions shown in this paper have real order parameters\nwhich minimize the energy, and therefore they are LO state. In the following sections,\nwe omit \"LO\" for the sake of brevity.\n\n\u2206(\u03b8)/\u22060\n\n(a)\n\n1\n0\n-1\n(b)\n1\n0\n-1\n(c)\n1\n0\n-1\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n0.6\n\u03b8/(2\u03c0)\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nFigure 1.

Thus we get the soliton lattice state with n pairs of soliton and anti-soliton\nas long as the system is in the dilute limit by which we mean n\u03be \u226a 2\u03c0, here the\nsoliton width \u03be is measured in unit of the angle. In the dilute limit, the solitons\nare well separated from each other, which has two consequences (i) all the midgap\nstates have zero energy, and (ii) each soliton or anti-soliton carries exactly one localized\nspin. According to these two properties, we distinguish soliton lattice state from the\nsinusoidally modulated state, where the spin imbalance n is too large to satisfy n\u03be < 2\u03c0\nand solitons overlap considerably with each other. Then the energy spectrum of the\nmidgap states has a dispersion described by the Bloch theorem for a periodic lattice.\nSuch a scenario from soliton lattice to sinusoidally varying state has also been addressed\nin Ref. [31] from the viewpoint of GL theory. The pairing parameter for both states\n \u0303 \u2021 with \u2206\n \u0303 tanh(cos n\u03b8/\u03be)\n \u0303 and \u03be \u0303 to\ncan be described perfectly by the fitting function \u2206\nbe determined, which is shown in Fig. 1.\nWe now introduce two spin distribution functions, local spin distribution SL (\u03b8) =\n\u2020\n1\nh\u03c8\u0302\u2191 (\u03b8)\u03c8\u0302\u2191 (\u03b8) \u2212 \u03c8\u0302\u2193\u2020 (\u03b8)\u03c8\u0302\u2193 (\u03b8)i as well as integrated spin distribution SI (\u03b8),\n2\nZ \u03b8\nSI (\u03b8) =\nSL (\u03b8\u2032 )d\u03b8\u2032 .\n(7)\n0\n\nAs shown in Fig. 2, the localization of spin density in the soliton lattice state manifests\nitself in the plateau features of the function SI (\u03b8).

[19], but we do not take that expression for the sake of simplicity.\n\n\f8\n\nImbalanced superfluid state in an annular disk\n2.3. Deformed Soliton\n\n\u2206(\u03b8)/\u22060\n\nHere we introduce Q to denote the number of spins per soliton/antisoliton. In the\nprevious subsections, we focused on the state with only one spin(Q = 1) per soliton.\nNow we study the case for Q \u2265 2, which we call deformed soliton state. Firstly, let us\nconsider the case for odd Q. The order parameter of a deformed soliton state for Q = 3\nis plotted in Fig. 3(solid lines), which corresponds to 6 excess spins in total. Note that\nthese 6 spins can also be stored in 3 ideal soliton-antisoliton pairs(dashed lines). Hence,\nwe need to compare their energies numerically. It turns out that the deformed soliton is\nenergetically favorable for strong interaction, while the ideal soliton state is preferable\nfor weak interaction. Note that the deformed soliton found in this article has Q nodes\nin a narrow region. In fact Q spins can also be accommodated by a special soliton with\nonly one nodes, which is described by \u22060 tanh(x/\u03be) with \u22060 \u03be = (Q + 1)/2(see Ref.[30]),\nhowever one can show that this solution is not energetically favored by comparing its\nenergy and that of the corresponding well separated multi-soliton state.\nIn Fig. 3, the upper panel corresponds to a strong interaction case where the three\nspins are squeezed in a very narrow region with width comparable to that of an ideal\nsoliton \u03be. The total width is then estimated to be around 2\u03be, which is much smaller\nthan the width 6\u03be for the ideal soliton state. Thus, one can reasonably believe that the\ndeformed soliton state has lower energy. If the interaction strength g becomes weaker,\nas shown in the lower panel of Fig. 3, the deformed soliton with Q = 3 will inflate\nand its pattern is getting close to three ideal solitons. When g becomes weak enough,\nthe deformed soliton can not be stable, and is transmuted into an ideal soliton lattice\nstate. The pairing order parameter shown in Fig. 3 can be perfectly fitted with function\n \u0303 0 [tanh(cos(\u03b8 \u2212 \u03b80 )/\u03be \u03030) \u2212 tanh(cos(\u03b8)/\u03be \u03030 + tanh(cos(\u03b8 + \u03b80 )/\u03be \u03030 ] with three parameters\n\u2206\n \u0303 0 , \u03be \u03030 and \u03b8\u03030 .\n\u2206\n\n1\n0.5 (a)\n0\n-0.5\n-1\n1\n0.5 (b)\n0\n-0.5\n-1\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n\u03b8/(2\u03c0)\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nFigure 3. Pairing parameter in deformed soliton with Q = 3 (solid lines) and ideal\nsoliton with Q = 1(dashed lines). Upper (lower) panel corresponds to the strong\n(weak) pairing interaction g.\n\nNote that the order parameter has a sign change (\u22121)Q after crossing Q ideal\nsolitons and antisolitons. Therefore, if Q is odd, a deformed soliton can be continuously\n\n\f9\n\nImbalanced superfluid state in an annular disk\n\ntransmuted into Q ideal solitons, but this is not true for even Q due to the mismatched\nboundary condition of \u2206(x). In addition, the energy of a deformed soliton with even Q\nis not energetically favorable in our numerical calculations. Therefore, we do not need\nto consider the case for even Q.\n2.4. Effect of Magnetic Field\nSo far we only consider the system with fixed particle number, and have not included\nthe magnetic field in our analysis. Since the total spin is a good quantum number,\nthe effect of magnetic field can be easily estimated by simply adding Zeeman energy\n\u2212\u03bcB h(N\u2191 \u2212 N\u2193 ). Obviously, the state with more excess spins gains magnetic energy,\nhowever it is at the cost of the deformation of pairing gap which loses the condensation\nenergy. Therefore, the ground state should correspond to an optimized value of spin\nimbalance.\nLet n = (N\u2191 \u2212 N\u2193 )/2 be the spin imbalance, and the corresponding ground state\nenergy be denoted by E(n). The energy of the BCS state without spin imbalance is thus\nE(0). Given an external magnetic field h, we then need to find the lowest free energy\nfor all possible n's, i.e., minimize E(n) \u2212 2n\u03bcB h with respect to n, which leads to an\noptimal spin imbalance nc .\nTo this purpose, we define the energy cost per spin as\n\u03b5(n) \u2261 [E(n) \u2212 E(0)]/(2n),\n\n(8)\n\n\u03b5(n)/\u22060\n\nwhich can also be regarded as the energy cost for creating one soliton. The numerical\ndata of \u03b5(n) is plotted in Fig. 4. As n increases, the adjacent kinks become closer,\nwhich enhances the hopping amplitude of spins between kinks and consequently favors\nthe kinetic energy of spin transfer. However, at the same time, the pairing gap gets\nsmaller, which reduces the condensation energy. Thus the interplay between these two\nmechanisms leads to the nontrivial pattern of \u03b5(n) in Fig. 4.\n0.8\n0.78\n0.76\n0.74\n0.72\n0.7\n0.68\n0.66\n0.64\n\n\u03bcBh1\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20 25 30 35\nspin imbalance\n\n40\n\n45\n\n50\n\nFigure 4. Average energy per spin \u03b5(n) in Eq. (8) as a function of spin imbalance n.\nThe dashed line is the first critical magnetic field h1 .\n\nThere is a critical value h1 of the magnetic field, below which the magnetic energy\ncan not support an ideal soliton, and the system remains in the uniform state. When\n\n\f10\n\nImbalanced superfluid state in an annular disk\n\nh > h1 , the sinusoidally varying state with modulation frequency nc will become\nenergetically favorable. nc can be determined by the minimum of 2n\u03b5(n) \u2212 2n\u03bcB h,\nalternatively, the optimal spin imbalance nc should satisfy\n\u2202(2n(\u01eb(n) \u2212 \u03bcB h))\n\u2202n\n\n=0\n\n(9)\n\nn=nc\n\nAfter a little algebraic analysis of Eq. (9), one can see that nc increases as h increases.\nThe first appeared nc is determined by \u01eb(nc ) = \u03bcB h1 which is far from zero as shown in\nFig. 4 and corresponds to a sinusoidally modulated state.\n3. Imbalanced Superfluid State in Annular Disk\nIn this section we present our numerical results for imbalanced superfluid state in narrow\nannular disk with inner radius R1 and outer radius R2 . The radial width R2 \u2212R1 is small\nenough to avoid the modulation of order parameter along the radial direction. In the\nnumerical calculation, we use the ratio \u03c1 \u2261 (R2 \u2212R1 )/R1 to characterize the geometry of\nannular disk. Since g has the dimension of [energy]*[length]2 , a dimensionless quantity\ng\u0303 \u2261 g/(\u03c0(R22 \u2212 R12 )\u03bc) is introduced to represent the interaction strength. The BdG\nequation is solved in momentum space. Most of the results in this section are based\nupon the diagonalization of Hamiltonian in a Hilbert space with dimensionality 3500\nand 11 radial modes involved.\n3.1. Fixing Particle Number N\u2191 and N\u2193\n3.1.1. Ideal Domain Wall For small spin imbalance, one should get domain walls\nas an analog of solitons in 1D case, and the excess spins are attached to the domain\nwalls. It is natural to ask what is the optimal number(Q) of spins per domain wall.\nTo answer this question, we first consider an ideal geometry, i.e., a narrow strip with\nperiodic boundary condition in both x and y directions, but with length Lx \u226b Ly .\nThis simplified model reads\n!\nZ\n\u02c62\np\n~\n\u2212 \u03bc\u03b1 \u03c8\u0302\u03b1\n\u0124\n=\ndxdy[\u03c8\u0302\u03b1\u2020\n2m\n+ \u2206(x, y)\u03c8\u0302\u2191\u2020 \u03c8\u0302\u2193\u2020 + \u2206\u2217 (x, y)\u03c8\u0302\u2193 \u03c8\u0302\u2191 \u2212\nD\nE\n\u2206(x, y) = g \u03c8\u0302\u2193 \u03c8\u0302\u2191 .\n\n|\u2206(x, y)|2\n]\ng\n\n(10)\n\nThe ideal domain wall pattern of \u2206(x, y) is independent of y, and has the form\n\u2206(x, y) = \u22060 tanh(x/\u03be0 ) which implies the pairing momenta in y direction are always\nq and \u2212q. The Hamiltonian in Eq. (10) can be divided into many 1D branches with\nrespect to the discrete momenta q = (2\u03c0/Ly ) \u00d7 integer in y direction,\n\u0013\n\u0012 2\nZ\np\u0302x\n\u2020\n\u2212 \u03bcq\u2191 \u03c8\u0302q,\u2191 (x)\n\u0124q \u223c\ndx[\u03c8\u0302q,\u2191 (x)\n2m\n\n\f11\n\nImbalanced superfluid state in an annular disk\n\u0013\n\u0012 2\np\u0302x\n\u2020\n\u2212 \u03bc\u2212q\u2193 \u03c8\u0302\u2212q,\u2193 (x)\n+ \u03c8\u0302\u2212q,\u2193 (x)\n2m\n\n\u2020\n\u2020\n+ \u2206\u03c8\u0302q,\u2191\n(x)\u03c8\u0302\u2212q,\u2193\n(x) + \u2206\u2217 \u03c8\u0302\u2212q,\u2193 (x)\u03c8\u0302q,\u2191 (x)] .\n\n(11)\n\nNote that \u2206(x) is contributed from all 1D branches, and the q-dependent chemical\npotential reads \u03bcq\u03b1 = \u03bc\u03b1 \u2212 (~q)2 /(2m), which are determined by the particle numbers\nN\u03b1 . Each q-mode with \u03bcq > 0 can accommodate one spin per soliton. Therefore, we\ncan estimate the optimal spin filling Q of each ideal domain wall to be the number\nof q-modes buried under the FS. The optimal filling for the annular disk with open\nboundary condition in the radial direction can also be estimated similarly by counting\nthe number of energy modes under the FS.\nSimilar to the 1D ring, one expects a crossover from an ideal domain wall like LO\nstate to the sinusoidally-varying LO state with increasing spin imbalance in the weak\ninteraction case. Since \u2206(r, \u03b8) now depends on r, we plot the angle dependence of \u2206(r, \u03b8)\nat radius r = (R1 + R2 )/2 in Fig. 5. The full spatial dependence of \u2206(r, \u03b8) is plotted in\n2D contour in Fig. 7, where one can find its radial dependence is nearly uniform. The\nspin density s(r, \u03b8) is also a function of r and \u03b8. By integrating s(r, \u03b8) over r, we can\ndefine angle dependent local spin distribution SL (\u03b8), and angle dependent integrated\nspin distribution SI (\u03b8), as following,\nZ R2\nrdrs(r, \u03b8)\nSL (\u03b8) =\nSI (\u03b8) =\n\nZ\n\nR1\n\u03b8\n\nSL (\u03b8)d\u03b8\u2032 .\n\n(12)\n\n0\n\n\u2206(\u03b8)/\u22060\n\nSL and SI are plotted as functions of \u03b8 in Fig. 6, which shows clearly that the spin\ndistribution are localized in the domain wall state, and delocalized in the sinusoidallyvarying LO state.\n\n1\n0.5\n0\n-0.5\n-1\n1\n0.5\n0\n-0.5\n-1\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n\u03b8/(2\u03c0)\nFigure 5.

Deformed Domain Wall and Phase Separation As in the 1D ring, we also\nencounter the deformed domain wall state, for which there can be more spins than\nthe optimal filling Q squeezed in one domain wall. These deformed domain wall states\nare stabilized by the strong pairing interaction. We plot the order parameter \u2206(\u03b8, r) and\nlocal spin distribution SL (\u03b8) in Fig. 8, which shows that when the spin number exceeds\nthe optimal filling, instead of creating more ideal domain walls, the spin polarized\nregions are simply enlarged. Note that in the polarized region there is still a small\npairing oscillation like a mini sinusoidally-varying LO state in order to further lower the\n\n\f13\n\nImbalanced superfluid state in an annular disk\n\n(a)\n\n30\n20\n10\n\n(d)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nSL(\u03b8)\n\nSL(\u03b8)\n\n1\n0.5\n0\n-0.5\n-1\n40\n30\n20\n10\n1\n0.5\n0\n-0.5\n-1\n\n\u2206(\u03b8)/\u22060\n\n\u2206(\u03b8)/\u22060\n\npotential energy.

Quasiparticle Density of States We compute the quasiparticle density of states\n(DOS) in this section which can describe the low energy excitations of various ground\nstates. In our calculation the Zeeman energy is not included, which corresponds to\nthe situation with fixed particle numbers. We find that, for the domain wall lattice\nstate there is a zero energy peak in the quasiparticle DOS. As the spin imbalance is\nincreasing, the number of domain walls grows and it results in the enhancement of\nthe zero energy peak. These zero modes can also be understood from the aspect of\nAndreev reflection[32], since the \u03c0-phase difference between two superfluids allows an\nAndreev bound state located at the domain walls. In the phase separation case, the\nsystem mimics a superconductor-normal metal-superconductor junction. By increasing\nthe width of normal metal region, more Andreev resonance states enter into the gap\nwith nonzero energy. These energy levels then distribute evenly in the gap, which form\na flat quasiparticle DOS in the superconducting gap.\nThe above theoretical analysis is in good agreement with the numerical results\npresented in Fig. 9. The DOS of BCS state is zero in the gap. When increasing the\nspin imbalance in the ideal domain wall lattice state, the peak of DOS centered around\nzero becomes higher, which means more domain walls are created. Whereas in the case\n\n\f14\n\nImbalanced superfluid state in an annular disk\n\nDOS(a.u.)\n\nof phase separation, the DOS in the gap is quite flat due to the presence of polarized\nnormal state.\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\nenergy/\u22060\n\n1\n\n2\n\nFigure 9.

Fixing Chemical Potentials \u03bc\u2191 and \u03bc\u2193\nIn this subsection, we show the numerical results in the grand canonical ensemble with\nfixed chemical potentials. For weak magnetic field(2\u03bcB h = \u03bc\u2191 \u2212 \u03bc\u2193 ), the Zeeman energy\nis not enough to break the s-wave Cooper pairs, so the system retains the uniform BCS\nstate. Until the magnetic field h exceeds its first critical value h1 , the sinusoidallyvarying LO state emerges. As the magnetic field is further increased, the modulation\nfrequency of the order parameter becomes larger while its magnitude is reduced, until\nthe system enters into the normal state at the second critical magnetic field h2 . We plot\nmodulation frequency as a function of h in Fig. 10, where one can find plateaus, since\nthere should be integral pairs of domain walls in a ring geometry.\nThe phase separation(deformed domain wall) state can not be a ground state\nin the homogeneous magnetic field, except at the critical value h1 of magnetic field.\nFurthermore, unlike the case of fixing particle number, there is no continuous crossover\nfrom domain wall state to the sinusoidally-varying state. The onset frequency at the\ncritical magnetic field h1 is finite and large enough to form a sinusoidally-varying LO\nstate. The reason is that, to sustain a single domain wall, its magnetic energy gain\nmust fully compensate the energy loss due to the deformation of pairing gap. In\nsuch a case there can be more domain walls. However the overlap of domain walls\nsuppresses the pairing gap inevitably, which causes the loss of the condensate energy(see\nsec. 2.4). At the balance point of these two processes, sinusoidally-varying state shows\nup accompanied with delocalized spins.\n\n\f15\n\nModulation frequency\n\nImbalanced superfluid state in an annular disk\n\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\n\nh1\n0.73\n\nh2\n0.75\n\u03bcBh/\u22060\n\n0.77\n\nFigure 10.

Conclusion\nWe have investigated the imbalanced superfluid state in annular disks and 1D rings by\nsolving the BdG equation in the momentum space at zero temperature. A key issue of\nimbalance superfluid is how to accommodate the excess spins by adjusting the pairing\ngap \u2206(~r). There are several possibilities, e.g. the LO state with periodically oscillated\norder parameter and the phase separation state. We show that these states are stable\nunder different conditions.\nFirstly, we have studied the case with fixed fermion numbers, which may be relevant\nto cold atom systems. For low spin imbalance (still larger than the optimal spin filling Q\nper domain wall), the solitons in 1D and domain walls in 2D are the ground states. The\nnumber of spins localized at each soliton or domain wall is quantized. When increasing\nspin imbalance, more and more domain walls(solitons) occur and overlap with each\nother, and the sinusoidally-varying state emerges with delocalized spins. These two\nstates are distinguished in this paper due to their different spin distribution. There\nshould be a crossover between them if one tunes the spin imbalance continuously. The\nabove argument is valid for weak interactions, whereas for strong interactions, the phase\nseparation is the possible ground state, in which only the area of normal polarized state\nvaries with the spin imbalance. This may serve as a criteria to distinguish the phase\nseparation state and the periodically oscillating LO state.\nSecondly, we have addressed the case of fixing chemical potential \u03bc and magnetic\nfield h, which may be relevant to heavy fermion superconductors interacting with an\nexternal magnetic field via the Zeeman term. There are two critical magnetic fields h1\nand h2 , which correspond to the transition from uniform BCS state to the sinusoidallyvarying state, and from the sinusoidally-varying state to the normal state, respectively.\nIt is stressed that the modulation frequency of pairing gap at h1 is quite large and the\nspin is delocalized, which characterizes a typical sinusoidally-varying state.\n\n\fImbalanced superfluid state in an annular disk\n\n16\n\nAcknowledgments\nF.Y. would like to thank T.
