Theoretical models in which the standard\nEinstein-Hilbert action is replaced by an arbitrary function of the Ricci scalar R, first proposed in [3], have been\nextensively investigated lately. Cosmic acceleration can\nbe explained by f (R) gravity [4], and the conditions of\nviable cosmological models have been derived in [5]. In\nthe context of the Solar System regime, severe weak field\nconstraints seem to rule out most of the models proposed\nso far [6, 7], although viable models do exist [8\u201311]. The\npossibility that the galactic dynamic of massive test particles can be understood without the need for dark matter was also considered in the framework of f (R) gravity\nmodels [12\u201316]. For a review of f (R) generalized gravity\nmodels see [17].\nA generalization of the f (R) gravity theories was proposed in [18] by including in the theory an explicit coupling of an arbitrary function of the Ricci scalar R with\nthe matter Lagrangian density Lm . As a result of the\ncoupling the motion of the massive particles is nongeodesic, and an extra force, orthogonal to the fourvelocity, arises. The connections with MOND and the\nPioneer anomaly were also explored. This model was\nextended to the case of the arbitrary couplings in both\ngeometry and matter in [19]. The implications of the\nnon-minimal coupling on the stellar equilibrium were in-\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: harko@hkucc.hku.hk\n\nvestigated in [20], where constraints on the coupling were\nalso obtained. An inequality which expresses a necessary\nand sufficient condition to avoid the Dolgov-Kawasaki instability for the model was derived in [21]. The relation\nbetween the model with geometry-matter coupling and\nordinary scalar-tensor gravity, or scalar-tensor theories\nwhich include non-standard couplings between the scalar\nand matter was studied in [27]. In the specific case where\nboth the action and the coupling are linear in R the action leads to a theory of gravity which includes higher\norder derivatives of the matter fields without introducing more dynamics in the gravity sector [22]. The equivalence between a scalar theory and the model with the\nnon-minimal coupling of the scalar curvature and matter\nwas considered in [23]. This equivalence allows for the\ncalculation of the PPN parameters \u03b2 and \u03b3, which may\nlead to a better understanding of the weak-field limit of\nf (R) theories. The equations of motion of test bodies in\nthe nonminimal coupling model by means of a multipole\nmethod were derived in [24]. The energy conditions and\nthe stability of the model under the Dolgov-Kawasaki criterion were studied in [25]. For a review of modified f (R)\ngravity with geometry-matter coupling see [26].\nThe extra force in the f (R) gravity with non-minimal\ncoupling has the intriguing property that it depends on\nboth the matter Lagrangian, and the energy-momentum\ntensor. It was pointed out in [27] that adopting the stan(1)\ndard Lagrangian density Lm = P , where P is the pressure, the extra force vanishes in the case of dust. Different forms for the matter Lagrangian density Lm , and the\nresulting extra-force, were considered in [28], and it was\n(2)\nshown that the more natural form for Lm , Lm = \u2212\u03c1,\ndoes not imply the vanishing of the extra-force. The\nimpact on the classical equivalence between different Lagrangian descriptions of a perfect fluid was also analyzed.\nRecently, the problem of the two Lagrangian descriptions\n\n\f2\nof a perfect fluid, and its effect on the extra force, was\nreconsidered in [29]. The main conclusion of this study is\nthat\" It is a fact that by choosing L1 = P there is no extra force on a dust fluid, and it is equally undeniable that\nby choosing L2 = \u2212\u03c1 there will be such a force, which\nmay ultimately provide an alternative to dark matter.\"\nIt is also pointed out that \"as soon as this fluid is coupled\nexplicitly to gravity ...the two Lagrangian densities cease\nto be equivalent\" [29].\nIt is the purpose of the present paper to show that in\nthe f (R) gravity with non-minimal coupling the matter\nLagrangian, and the corresponding energy-momentum\ntensor, are not model-independent quantities, but they\nare completely and uniquely determined by the nature of\nthe coupling between matter and geometry. This result\ncan be obtained by deriving first the equations of motion\nin the modified gravity model from a variational principle, and then considering the Newtonian limit of the\nparticle action for a fluid obeying a barotropic equation\nof state. The corresponding energy-momentum tensor\nof the matter is more general than the usual generalrelativistic energy-momentum tensor for perfect fluids,\nand it contains a supplementary term that may be related\nto the elastic stresses in the body, or to other sources of\ninternal energy. The matter Lagrangian can be expressed\neither in terms of the density, or in terms of the pressure,\nand in both representations the physical description of\nthe system is equivalent. Therefore the presence (or absence) of the extra-force is independent of the specific\nform of the matter Lagrangian, and it never vanishes,\nexcept the case of (un)physical systems with zero sound\nspeed. In particular, in the case of dust particles, the\nextra-force is always non-zero.\nThe present paper is organized as follows. The matter\nLagrangian and the energy-momentum tensor in f (R)\ngravity with non-minimal coupling are derived in Section\nII. We discuss and conclude our results in Section III. In\nthe present paper we use the Landau-Lifshitz [30] sign\nconventions and definitions, and the natural system of\nunits with c = 8\u03c0G = 1.\n\nII. MATTER AND ENERGY-MOMENTUM\nTENSOR IN MODIFIED GRAVITY WITH\nLINEAR COUPLING BETWEEN GEOMETRY\nAND MATTER\n\nThe action for the modified theories of gravity proposed in [18] takes the following form\nS=\n\nZ \u001a\n\n\u001b\n\u221a\n1\n\u2212g d4 x ,\nf1 (R) + [1 + \u03bbf2 (R)] Lm\n2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere fi (R) (with i = 1, 2) are arbitrary functions of the\nRicci scalar R, and Lm is the Lagrangian density corresponding to matter. The strength of the interaction\nbetween f2 (R) and the matter Lagrangian is characterized by a coupling constant \u03bb. We define the energy-\n\nmomentum tensor of the matter as [30]\n\u0014 \u221a\n\u0015\n\u221a\n\u2202 ( \u2212gLm )\n\u2202 \u2202 ( \u2212gLm )\n2\n. (2)\n\u2212\nT\u03bc\u03bd = \u2212 \u221a\n\u2212g\n\u2202g \u03bc\u03bd\n\u2202x\u03bb \u2202 (\u2202g \u03bc\u03bd /\u2202x\u03bb )\nBy assuming that the Lagrangian density Lm of the\nmatter depends only on the metric tensor components\ng\u03bc\u03bd , and not on its derivatives, we obtain T\u03bc\u03bd = Lm g\u03bc\u03bd \u2212\n2\u2202Lm /\u2202g \u03bc\u03bd . By taking into account the explicit form of\nthe field equations one obtains for the covariant divergence of the energy-momentum tensor the equation [18]\n\u2207\u03bc T\u03bc\u03bd = 2 {\u2207\u03bc ln [1 + \u03bbf2 (R)]}\n\n\u2202Lm\n.\n\u2202g \u03bc\u03bd\n\n(3)\n\nAs a specific example of generalized gravity models\nwith linear matter-geometry coupling, we consider the\ncase in which the matter, assumed to be a perfect thermodynamic fluid, obeys a barotropic equation of state,\nwith the thermodynamic pressure p being a function of\nthe rest mass density of the matter (for short: matter\ndensity) \u03c1 only, so that p = p (\u03c1). In this case, the matter\nLagrangian density, which in the general case could be a\nfunction of both density and pressure, Lm = Lm (\u03c1, p), or\nof only one of the thermodynamic parameters, becomes\nan arbitrary function of the density of the matter \u03c1 only,\nso that Lm = Lm (\u03c1). Then the energy-momentum tensor of the matter is given by\n\u0013\n\u0012\ndLm\ndLm \u03bc \u03bd\n\u03bc\u03bd\ng \u03bc\u03bd ,\n(4)\nu u + Lm \u2212 \u03c1\nT =\u03c1\nd\u03c1\nd\u03c1\nwhere the four-velocity u\u03bc = dx\u03bc /ds satisfies the condition g \u03bc\u03bd u\u03bc u\u03bd = 1. To obtain Eq. (4) we have imposed the condition of the conservation of the matter\ncurrent, \u2207\u03bd (\u03c1u\u03bd ) = 0, and we have used the relation\n\u03b4\u03c1 = (1/2) \u03c1 (g\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 u\u03bc u\u03bd ) \u03b4g \u03bc\u03bd , whose proof is given in\nthe Appendix. With the use of the identity u\u03bd \u2207\u03bd u\u03bc =\nd2 x\u03bc /ds2 + \u0393\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb u\u03bd u\u03bb , from Eqs. (3) and (4) we obtain the\nequation of motion of a test fluid in the modified gravity\nmodel with linear coupling between matter and geometry\nas\nd2 x\u03bc\n+ \u0393\u03bc\u03bd\u03bb u\u03bd u\u03bb = f \u03bc ,\nds2\n\n(5)\n\nwhere\n\u001a\n\ndLm (\u03c1)\nf = \u2212\u2207\u03bd ln [1 + \u03bbf2 (R)]\nd\u03c1\n\u03bc\n\n\u001b\n\n(u\u03bc u\u03bd \u2212 g \u03bc\u03bd ) .\n\n(6)\nThe extra-force f \u03bc , generated due to the presence of\nthe coupling between matter and geometry, is perpendicular to the four-velocity, f \u03bc u\u03bc = 0.

By introducing the energy density of the body\naccording to the definition \u03b5 = \u03c1 [1 + \u03a6 (\u03c1)], the energymomentum tensor of a test fluid can be written in the\nmodified gravity models with geometry-matter coupling\nin a form similar to the standard general relativistic case,\nT \u03bc\u03bd = [\u03b5 (\u03c1) + p (\u03c1)] u\u03bc u\u03bd \u2212 p (\u03c1) g \u03bc\u03bd\nFrom a physical point of view \u03a6 (\u03c1) can be interpreted as the elastic (deformation) potential energy of the\nbody, and therefore Eq. (16) corresponds to the energymomentum tensor of a compressible elastic isotropic system. The matter Lagrangian can also be written in the\nsimpler form Lm (\u03c1) = \u03c1\u03a6 (\u03c1).\nIf the pressure does not have a thermodynamic or radiative component one can take p0 = 0. If the pressure is a constant background quantity, independent of\nthe density, so that p = p0 , then Lm (\u03c1) = \u03c1, and the\nenergy-momentum tensor of the matter takes the form\ncorresponding to dust, T \u03bc\u03bd = \u03c1u\u03bc u\u03bd .\nIII.\n\nDISCUSSIONS AND FINAL REMARKS\n\nIn the present paper we have shown that in the\nf (R) gravity with non-minimal coupling the matter Lagrangian and the energy-momentum tensor can be obtained uniquely and consistently from the form of the\ncoupling between matter and geometry. The coupling\ncompletely fixes both the matter Lagrangian, and the\nenergy-momentum tensor. Since the matter is supposed\nto obey a barotropic equation of state, this result is independent of the concrete representation of the matter Lagrangian in terms of the thermodynamic quantities. The\nsame results are obtained by assuming Lm = Lm (p) - due\nto the equation of state \u03c1 and p are freely interchangeable thermodynamic quantities, and the Lagrangians expressed in terms of \u03c1 and p only are completely equivalent. More general situations, in which the density and\npressure are functions of the particle number and temperature, respectively, and the equation of state is given\nin a parametric form, can be analyzed in a similar way.\n\n\f4\nThe form of the matter Lagrangian, and the energymomentum tensor, are strongly dependent on the equation of state. For example, if the barotropic equation of\nstate is linear, p = (\u03b3 \u2212 1) \u03c1, \u03b3 = constant, 1 \u2264 \u03b3 \u2264 2,\nthen\n\u0015\u001b\n\u001a\n\u0014 \u0012 \u0013\n\u03c1\n\u22121 ,\n(18)\nLm (\u03c1) = \u03c1 1 + (\u03b3 \u2212 1) ln\n\u03c10\nand \u03a6 (\u03c1) = (\u03b3 \u2212 1) ln (\u03c1/\u03c10 ), respectively. In the\ncase of a polytropic equation of state p = K\u03c11+1/n ,\nK, n =constant, we obtain\n\u0012 2\n\u0013\nn\nLm (\u03c1) = \u03c1 + K\n\u2212 1 \u03c11+1/n ,\n(19)\nn+1\nand \u03a6 (\u03c1) = Kn\u03c11+1/n = np (\u03c1), respectively, where we\nhave taken for simplicity \u03c10 = p0 = 0. For a fluid satisfying the ideal gas equation of state p = kB \u03c1T /\u03bc, where\nkB is Boltzmann's constant, T is the temperature, and \u03bc\nis the mean molecular weight, we obtain\n\u0014 \u0012 \u0013\n\u0015\u001b\n\u001a\n\u03c1\nkB T\nln\n\u2212 1 + p0 .\n(20)\nLm (\u03c1) = \u03c1 1 +\n\u03bc\n\u03c10\nIn the case of a physical system satisfying the ideal gas\nequation of state, the extra-acceleration induced by the\npresence of the non-minimal coupling between matter\nand geometry is given by\n\u0015\n\u0014\n\u03c1\nkB T\n,\n(21)\n\u2207 f2 (R) ln\n~aE \u2248 \u2212\u03bb\n\u03bc\n\u03c10\n\nIn conclusion, the extra-force induced by the coupling\nbetween matter and geometry does not vanish for any\nspecific choices of the matter Lagrangian. In the case of\nthe dust, with p = 0, the extra force is given by\nf \u03bc = \u2212\u2207\u03bd ln [1 + \u03bbf2 (R)] (u\u03bc u\u03bd \u2212 g \u03bc\u03bd ) ,\n\n(22)\n\nand it is independent on the thermodynamic properties\nof the system, being completely determined by geometry,\nkinematics and coupling. In the limit of small velocities\nand weak gravitational fields, the extra-acceleration of a\ndust fluid is given by\n~aE = \u2212\u03bb\u2207 [f2 (R)] .\n\n(23)\n\nThe thermodynamic condition for the vanishing of the extra-force is \u2202Lm /\u2202g \u03bc\u03bd\n=\n(1/2) (\u2202Lm /\u2202\u03c1) \u03c1 (g\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 u\u03bc u\u03bd ) = 0 only. If the matter\nLagrangian is written as a function of the pressure,\nthen \u2202Lm /\u2202\u03c1 = (\u2202Lm /\u2202p) (\u2202p/\u2202\u03c1), and for all physical\nsystems satisfying an equation of state (or, equivalently,\nfor all systems with a non-zero sound velocity), the\nextra-force is non-zero. Therefore, the geometry-matter\ncoupling is introduced in the generalized gravity models [18] and [19] in a consistent way. The coupling\ndetermines all the physical properties of the system,\nincluding the extra-force, the matter Lagrangian, and\nthe energy-momentum tensor, respectively.\n\nand it is proportional to the temperature of the fluid. It is\nalso interesting to note that the limiting density and pressure \u03c10 and p0 generate in the energy-momentum tensor\nsome extra constant terms, which may be interpreted as\nthe dark energy.\n\nThis work is supported by an RGC grant of the government of the Hong Kong SAR.\n\n[1] A.

We define the fourvelocities of the fluid in the two frames as u\u03b1 = dx\u03b1 /ds(x)\nand Q\u03b1 = da\u03b1 /ds(a) , where ds2(x) = g\u03b1\u03b2 dx\u03b1 dx\u03b2 and\nds2(a) = \u03b7\u03b1\u03b2 da\u03b1 da\u03b2 , respectively.
