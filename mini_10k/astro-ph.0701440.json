The outflows occur, at least\nin some cases, at distances from the radio core that range between few hundred\nparsecs and kpc. These H I outflows likely originate from the interaction between\nradio jets and the dense surrounding medium. The estimated mass outflow rates\nare comparable to those of moderate starburst-driven superwinds. The impact\non the evolution of the host galaxies is discussed.\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nHuge amounts of energy are produced through the accretion of material on to\nthe super-massive black hole situated in the centre of an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN). This energy is released into the surrounding medium in a number\nof different ways, ranging from collimated radio-plasma jets to UV and X-ray\nemission. The regions around an AGN are, therefore, highly complex and host\na wealth of physical processes. Gas in different phases (atomic, molecular and\nionised) is observed in this very hostile environment. This gas - in particular its\nkinematics and ionisation - can bear the signature of the effects of the AGN on\nits surrounding medium.For example, the energy released from the nucleus can\nproduce gas outflows of very high velocities (thousands km s\u22121 ).\nGas outflows have a wide range of effects, including clearing the circumnuclear regions and halting the growth of the supermassive black-holes (see e.g.\nSilk & Rees 1998, Di Matteo et al. 2005). These effects can be at the origin of\ncorrelations found between the masses of the central super-massive black-hole\nand the properties of the host galaxies. They can also prevent the formation\nof too many massive galaxies in the early universe. In addition, outflows can\ninject energy and metals into the interstellar and intergalactic medium. It has\nbeen suggested that AGN-driven outflows are a major source of feedback in the\noverall galaxy formation process.\n1\n\n\f2\nOutflows of ionised gas have been observed in many AGN, from Seyfert\ngalaxies to quasars (see e.g. Crenshaw, Kraemer & George 2003 and Crenshaw\nthese proceedings). In addition to this, we have recently discovered fast and massive outflows of neutral hydrogen detected as 21-cm H I absorption against the\ncentral regions of radio-loud galaxies (Morganti, Tadhunter & Oosterloo 2005).\nThe characteristics and the possible effects of these outflows are summarised in\nthis contribution.\n2.\n\nFast H I outflows\n\nUsing the Westerbork Synthesis Radio Telescope (WSRT) we have detected\nvery broad H I absorption components in 6 radio galaxies. Three examples of\nthe detected H I absorption are shown in Fig. 1. The broad absorption is\nobserved against the strong nuclear radio continum. This broad H I component\nhas been also found in a radio-loud Seyfert galaxy (IC 5063) observed with the\nAustralia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA). These objects are characterised\nby the presence of a rich ISM surrounding the AGN, e.g. strong CO or far-IR\nemission, and/or known to have undergone a major episode of star formation\nin the recent past (Tadhunter et al. 2005). Some of them have strong, steepspectrum core emission (on a scale <10 kpc, i.e. unresolved at the resolution of\nthe WSRT 21-cm observations). These objects are considered to be young or\nrecently restarted radio sources. In many of the objects the presence of a deep\nbut narrow H I component was already known and studied, but the shallow\nbroad component was discovered only by the new observations (thanks to the\nbroad band that the upgraded WSRT could offered).\nThe broad H I component is typically very shallow (peak optical depth as\nlow as \u03c4 \u223c 0.0005), with the full width at zero intensity (FWZI) of the absorption\nranging between 600 km s\u22121 and almost 2000 km s\u22121 - perhaps the broadest\nfound so far in H I 21-cm absorption in any class of astronomical objects. A large\nfraction of the H I absorption is blueshifted relative to the systemic velocity of the\ngalaxy. Because the gas producing the absorption must be in front of the radio\nsource, this provides unambiguous evidence that the bulk of gas is outflowing.\nThe typical column densities found for the broad absorption are 1 to 10\u00d71021\ncm\u22122 (for a Tspin = 1000 K). More details can be found in Morganti et al. (2003,\n2005a,b), Emonts et al. (2003).\nIn order to understand the origin of such outflows and quantify their effects\nit is crucial to know their location as well as obtain a complete as possible view\nof what are the characteristics of the gas in other phases (e.g. ionised gas).\n3.\n\nWhat is the origin?\n\nUnderstanding the driving mechanism(s) of the outflows is crucial for understanding more about the physical mechanisms at work in the central regions of\nAGN. Radiation or wind pressure from the regions near the active super-massive\nblack hole (i.e. a quasar wind) are the likely drivers of the gas outflows detected\nin X-ray and UV. However, in radio-loud objects, an other possible mechanism\nfor driving the outflows is the interaction of the radio plasma with the (rich)\ngaseous medium in the direct vicinity of the active nucleus (Tadhunter 2007).\n\n\f3\n3C 236\n\nOQ 208\n\n3C 305\n4\n\n0\n\nRFI\n\n2\n\nS (mJy)\n\n0\n\n-50\n\nS (mJy)\n\nS (mJy)\n\n0\n\n-5\n\n-10\n\n\u22124\n\n-100\n\n\u22126\n\n-15\n28500\n\n29000\n\n29500\n\n30000\n\u22121\n\nVhel (km s )\n\n30500\n\n11000\n\n,\n\n\u22122\n\n11500\n\n12000\n\n12500\n\u22121\n\nVhel (km s )\n\n13000\n\n21000\n\n22000\n\n23000\n\n24000\n\n\u22121)\n\nVhel (km s\n\nFigure 1.\n21 cm - H I absorption profiles detected against three radio galaxies. The observations of the radio galaxies were done using the upgraded\nWSRT. The vertical line indicates the systemic velocity.\n\nIn the case of the fast H I outflows presented here, there is now strong evidence\nthat this is likely to be the case. This evidence comprises follow-up observations\nat higher resolution of two of the objects in our sample (IC 5063 and 3C 305,\nOosterloo et al. 2000 and Morganti et al. 2005 respectively) that demonstrate\nthat the outflow regions are resolved on a scale of 200 pc (IC 5063) and 1.6 kpc\n(3C 305), and spatially associated with both the extended, bright radio lobes\nand the outflows of ionised gas detected at the same locations in optical observations. In a third case (3C 293), the evidence that the outflow is located at \u223c 1\nkpc is more indirect (Morganti et al. 2003, Emonts et al. 2005). The presence\nof neutral atomic gas accelerated to such high velocities is in itself intriguing.\nIt indicates that after a strong jet-cloud interaction the gas can cool very efficiently. Such rapid cooling is indeed predicted by recent numerical simulations\nof jets impacting on gas clouds (Mellema et al. 2002, Fragile et al. 2004, Krause\n2007).\n3.1.\n\nEffects on the galaxy\n\nThe main result of this study is that the neutral outflows occur, in at least\nsome cases, at kpc distance from the nucleus, and they are most likely driven\nby the interactions between the expanding radio jets and the gaseous medium\nenshrouding the central regions. We estimate that the associated mass outflow\nrates are up to \u223c 50 M\u2299 yr\u22121 , comparable (although at the lower end of the\ndistribution) to the outflow rates found for starburst-driven superwinds in Ultra\nLuminous IR Galaxies (ULIRG), see Rupke et al. (2002). This suggests that\nmassive, jet-driven outflows of neutral gas in radio-loud AGN can have as large\nan impact on the evolution of the host galaxies as the outflows associated with\nstarbursts. This is important as starburst-driven winds are recognised to be\nresponsible for inhibiting early star formation, enriching the ICM with metals\nand heating the ISM/IGM medium.\nIn few cases we have done a more detailed study of the characteristics of the\noutflow to investigate whether its properties are consistent with the assumption\nof the AGN feedback models. Particularly interesting is the case of IC 5063,\nwhere the mass outflow rates of cold (H I) and warm (ionised) gas have been\nfound to be comparable, \u223c 30 M\u2299 yr\u22121 . With a black-hole mass of 2.8 \u00d7 108\nM\u2299 (Nicastro, Martochia & Matt 2003), the Eddington luminosity of IC 5063 is\n\n\f4\n\n,\nFigure 2.\nComparison between the width of the H I absorption (white profile, Oosterloo et al. 2000) and that of the ionised gas (from the [O III]5007\u00c5).\nThe first order similarity between the amplitude of the blueshifted component\ncovered by the two phases of the gas is clearly seen.\n\n3.8 \u00d7 1046 erg s\u22121 , this means that the kinetic power of the outflow represents\nonly about few \u00d710\u22124 of the available accretion power (Morganti et al. in prep).\nThis result is similar to what found for PKS 1549-79 (Holt et al. 2006 and these\nproceedings). However, unlike the case of PKS 1549-79, IC 5063 accrete at low\nrate (\u1e41 \u223c 0.02, Nicastro et al. 2003). Thus, in IC 5063 the kinetic power\nof the outflow appears to be a relative high fraction of the nuclear bolometric\nluminosity (\u223c 8 \u00d7 10\u22122 ) compared to what found in some more luminous radio\ngalaxies. This might be relevant for the feedback process.\nReferences\nCrenshaw D.M., Kraemer S.B., George I.M. 2003, ARAA 41, 117\nDi Matteo T., Springel V., Hernquist L. 2005, Nature 433, p. 604\nDopita M.A., Groves B.A., Sutherland R.S., Binette L., Cecil G. 2002, ApJ 572, 753\nEmonts B.H.C. et al. 2005, MNRAS 362, 931\nFabian A.
