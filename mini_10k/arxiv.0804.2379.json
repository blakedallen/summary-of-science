Introduction\nThe Hubbard model on a square lattice is the simplest toy model for the description\nof the effects of electronic correlations in the spin spectrum of the Mott-Hubbard\ninsulators cuprates parent compounds [1, 2]. On the square and cubic lattices the\nmodel has no exact solution and many open questions about its properties remain\nunsolved. Fortunately, it can be experimentally realized with unprecedented precision\nin systems of correlated ultra-cold fermionic atoms on an optical lattice [3]. Recent\nexperiments considered the Hubbard model on the cubic lattice [4]. They involved\nultra-cold fermionic atoms on an optical cubic lattice formed by interfering laser fields.\nSimilar experiments referring to the model on the square lattice are in progress. One\nmay expect very detailed experimental results over a wide range of parameters to be\navailable.\nIn this paper we study the spin occupancy configurations of the ground state of\nthe Hubbard model on a square lattice with Na2 \u226b 1 sites within the spin-singlet twospinon s1 bond-particle description also used in the investigations of Ref. [2]. Here Na\nis the number of sites of an edge of length L = Na a and spacing a. Hence the total\nnumber of sites of the square lattice of area L2 is Na2 \u2261 Na \u00d7 Na . That description\ninvolves the generalization to all finite values of the on-site repulsion U > 0 of the exact\ntransformation for separation of spin-1/2 fermions without constraints introduced for\nlarge U values in Ref. [5]. It is consistent with the global SO(3) \u00d7 SO(3) \u00d7 U(1) =\n[SO(4) \u00d7 U(1)]/Z2 symmetry found recently in Ref. [6] for the model on any bipartite\nlattice. That global symmetry is an extension of the SO(4) symmetry known to occur for\nthe model on such lattices [7]. The extended global symmetry is related to the rotated\nelectrons that for U > 0 emerge from the electrons through a unitary transformation of\nthe type considered in Ref. [8] and to the local symmetries and unitary transformations\nconsidered in Ref. [9]. For rotated electrons double and single occupancy are good\nquantum numbers for U > 0.\nHere we study the spin configurations of the model ground states and excited states\nthat span the subspace relevant for the one- and two-electron physics. It is spanned by\nan initial vanishing-spin-density ground state and the energy and momentum eigenstates\ncontained in the excitations generated by application onto that ground state of one- and\ntwo-electron operators. Within the description used in the studies of Ref. [2], for Na2 \u226b 1\nsuch states can be generated by suitable occupancy configurations of two basic quantum\nobjects: spin-less and \u03b7-spin-less charge c fermions and spin-1/2 spinons. There are also\n\u03b7-spin-1/2 \u03b7-spinons, yet in that subspace they refer to a single occupancy configuration\nand thus play no active role. The spinons describe the spin degrees of freedom of the\nrotated-electron singly occupied sites. Their spin projection is the same as that of the\ncorresponding rotated electron. The \u03b7-spinons of \u03b7-spin projection down and up describe\nthe \u03b7-spin degrees of freedom of the rotated-electron doubly occupied and unoccupied\nsites, respectively. In our subspace rotated-electron double occupancy vanishes and\nthere are only \u03b7-spin-up \u03b7-spinons. The spinon spin-singlet configurations involve in\n\n\fGround-state two-spinon bonds in the Hubbard model on a square lattice\n\n3\n\ngeneral the 2\u03bd-spinon and 2\u03bd-site s\u03bd bond particles [2]. Here \u03bd = 1, 2, 3, ... refers to the\nnumber of spinon pairs in each s\u03bd bond. Fortunately, the ground states and their oneand two-electron excited states considered here, except the spin-singlet states, involve\nonly two-spinon and two-site s1 bond particles. Moreover, the latter states involve in\naddition to the s1 bond particles a single four-spinon and four-site s2 bond particle.\nThe c fermions live on a c effective lattice identical to the original lattice. The c\nfermion occupied sites describe the charge degrees of freedom to those singly occupied\nby rotated electrons. The corresponding spin degrees of freedom are described by the\nspinons. In turn, the c fermion unoccupied sites correspond to those doubly occupied\nor unoccupied by rotated electrons. The corresponding \u03b7-spin degrees of freedom are\ndescribed by the \u03b7-spinons. Importantly, the spatial coordinates of the c fermion\noccupied and unoccupied sites are also the spatial coordinates in the original lattice\nof the sites referring to spinons and \u03b7-spinons, respectively. Provided that Na2 \u226b 1 this\nis behind the occupancies of the spin effective lattice and \u03b7-spin effective lattice being\nindependent [2]. Such effective lattices involve only the rotated-electron singly occupied\nsites and the rotated-electron doubly occupied and unoccupied sites, respectively.\nThe spinons that are not part of s\u03bd bond particles are called independent spinons.\nThey are invariant under the electron - rotated-electron unitary transformation. For\nthe lowest-weight states whose spin Ss and spin projection Ssz are such that Ss = \u2212Ssz\nthe independent spinons have up spin projection. For the subspace considered here all\n\u03b7-spinons have up \u03b7-spin projection so that the \u03b7-spinon effective lattice plays no active\nrole. In turn, since the location in the original lattice of the sites of the spin effective\nlattice is recorded in the c fermion occupancy configurations, it turns out that provided\nthat Na2 \u226b 1 it is a good approximation to consider that the spin effective lattice is a\nsquare lattice with the same length edge L as the original lattice and a number of sites\nNa2s and spacing as given by,\na\n, (1 \u2212 x) \u2265 1/NaD .\n(1)\nNaDs = (1 \u2212 x) NaD ; as =\n(1 \u2212 x)1/D\n\nHere D = 2 refers to the present square lattice, D = 1 corresponds to the onedimensional (1D) lattice some times considered below, and x = (NaD \u2212 N)/NaD is\nthe hole concentration. For Na2 \u226b 1, in spite of rotated-electron single occupancy\nbeing only conserved globally and not locally, the spinon occupancies of the spin\neffective lattice provide a good approximation of the ground state and excited states\nspin configurations [2]. Furthermore, within the present description such configurations\ninvolve the occupancies of a s1 effective lattice. Its unoccupied sites are the up-spin\nindependent spinons. Its occupied sites refer to the two-spinon s1 bond particles studied\nin this paper. Hence each occupied site of the s1 effective lattice corresponds to two\nsites of both the original lattice and spin effective lattice.\nBond states based on two-spinon and two-site bonds are in general not orthogonal\nand their basis is overcomplete. However, within the representation used in the studies\nof this paper such a problem does not occur. This is due to physical restrictions of\nthe occupancy configurations of the well-defined set of two-site bonds contributing to\n\n\fGround-state two-spinon bonds in the Hubbard model on a square lattice\n\n4\n\na given s1 bond particle. For instance, that they are centered at the same real-space\ncoordinate of the spin effective lattice. For 1D the discrete momentum values of both the\nc fermions and s1 fermions generated from the s1 bond particles studied here through\nan extended Jordan-Wigner transformation [2, 10, 11, 12] are good quantum numbers\nwhose occupancy configurations generate the energy eigenstates [13].\nEvidence that for the one- and two-electron subspace the states generated by the\noccupancy configurations of such discrete momentum values are for the model on the\nsquare lattice energy eigenstates is given in the related investigations carried out in\nRef. [2]. The square-lattice quantum liquid introduced in that reference contains the\none- and two-electron excitations of the Hubbard model on a square lattice. At hole\nconcentration x = (Na2 \u2212 N)/Na2 = 0, U/4t \u2248 1.525, and t \u2248 295 meV it is found\nin that reference to quantitatively describing the spin-wave spectrum observed in the\nparent compound La2 CuO4 [1]. In turn, it is expected that the description of the role\nof electronic correlations in the unusual properties of the cuprate hight-temperature\nsuperconductors [14, 15, 16, 17] requires as well accounting for the effects of threedimensional uniaxial anisotropy and intrinsic disorder.\nThe spin-singlet two-spinon s1 bond particle configurations studied in this paper are\nan example of the general resonating-valence-bond pictures for spin-singlet occupancy\nconfigurations of ground states studied in Refs. [18, 19]. As mentioned above, the\nparticular type of spin configurations based on two-spinon and two-site bonds considered\nin our studies lack both the non-orthogonality and overcompleteness problems. Such\nspin-singlet two-spinon s1 bond particle configurations refer to the c and s1 fermion\ndescription also used in the investigations of Ref. [2] on the Hubbard model on the\nsquare lattice. Some progress in understanding the physics of that model has been\nachieved for different limits, through a variety of methods. It corresponds to a nonperturbative quantum problem in terms of electron operators, so that rewriting the\ntheory in terms of the standard formalism of many-electron physics is an extremely\ncomplex problem. A detailed and extensive discussion of the relation between the new\nresults obtained both in Ref. [2] and this paper by means of the c and s1 fermion\ndescription and previously known results is presented in that reference.\nFor instance, it is shown that the predictions of the square-lattice quantum liquid\ntheory concerning the spin spectrum at half filling as described in terms of the spinsinglet two-spinon configurations studied in this paper agree both with experiments\non the parent compound La2 CuO4 and results obtained by the standard formalism of\nmany-body physics. Furthermore, in Ref. [2] the relation of the description used in the\nstudies of this paper and that reference to several other schemes is discussed.\nThe paper is organized as follows. The model, the basic rotated-electron\nrepresentation, and the description in terms of the basic quantum objects, which emerge\nfrom the rotated-electron occupancy configurations, are the subjects of Section 2. The\ns1 effective lattice, corresponding change of gauge structure, and s1 operators of the\nh\nh\nNs1\n= 0 configuration state are the topics addressed in Section 3. (Here Ns1\ndenotes\nthe number of unoccupied sites of the s1 effective lattice.) Section 4 contains a study\n\n\fGround-state two-spinon bonds in the Hubbard model on a square lattice\n\n5\n\nh\nof the Ns1\n= 1, 2 configuration states and kink-like and anti-kink-like link occupancies\nassociated with the s1 effective lattice unoccupied sites. Finally, Section 5 contains the\nconcluding remarks.\n\n2. The Hubbard model on the square lattice, rotated electrons, and the\ndescription used in our studies\n2.1.

Hence the operator D\u0302 = [N\u0302 \u2212 Q\u0302]/2 counts the number\nP\nP aD\nof electron doubly occupied sites where N\u0302 = \u03c3 N\u0302\u03c3 and N\u0302\u03c3 = N\nrj ,\u03c3 .\nj=1 n~\nThe studies of Ref. [2] use a uniquely-defined electron - rotated-electron unitary\nV\u0302 = V\u0302 (U/4t). It is such that states |\u03a8U/4t i = V\u0302 \u2020 |\u03a8\u221e i are for U/4t > 0 energy\neigenstates. It corresponds to a suitable chosen set {|\u03a8\u221e i} of U/4t \u2192 \u221e energy\neigenstates. The unitary transformation maps the electronic operators c~r\u2020j ,\u03c3 and c~rj ,\u03c3\nonto rotated-electron creation and annihilation operators c\u0303~\u2020rj ,\u03c3 = V\u0302 \u2020 c~\u2020rj ,\u03c3 V\u0302 and c\u0303~rj ,\u03c3 =\n\nV\u0302 \u2020 c~rj ,\u03c3 V\u0302 , respectively.\nThe studies of Ref. [6] reveal that for U/4t > 0 the Hubbard model on a square\nlattice has a global SO(3) \u00d7 SO(3) \u00d7 U(1) symmetry. The generator S\u0303c of the hidden\nglobal U(1) symmetry reads S\u0303c = V\u0302 \u2020 \u015cc V\u0302 where \u015cc = Q\u0302/2 and the operator Q\u0302 is given\nin Eq. (3). Its eigenvalue Sc is one-half the number of rotated-electron singly occupied\nsites 2Sc . Indeed, the rotated electrons of Refs. [2, 6] are constructed in such a way that\nSc is a good quantum number in the rotated-electron picture. The subspaces spanned\nby states whose number 2Sc is constant play an important role.

In turn, for states with\na finite number of s1 bond particles the c fermions are not invariant under that\ntransformation.\nThe whole physics can be extracted from the model (2) in the LWS-subspace\nreferring to values of S\u03b1 and S\u03b1z such that S\u03b1 = \u2212S\u03b1z for \u03b1 = \u03b7, s [2].

For the square lattice the two spin effective sub-lattices have\n\u221a\nlattice constant as1 = 2 as . In turn, for 1D the sites of each spin effective sub-lattice\nare distributed alternately along the chain, the corresponding nearest-neighboring sites\nbeing separated by as1 = 2as . The fundamental translation vectors of such sub-lattices\nread,\nas1\nas1\n~as1 = as1 ~ex1 , [1D] ; ~as1 = \u221a (~ex1 +~ex2 ) ; ~bs1 = \u2212 \u221a (~ex1 \u2212~ex2 ) , [2D] , (12)\n2\n2\nwhere ~ex1 and ~ex2 are the unit vectors. The vectors given in Eq. (12) are the fundamental\ntranslation vectors of the s1 effective lattice [2].\nThe c fermions are \u03b7-spinless and spinless fermions without internal structure and\ntheir effective lattice is identical to the original lattice. In contrast, the composite twospinon s1 bond particles have internal structure and expression of their s1 effective\nlattice occupancies in terms of spinon occupancies of the spin effective lattice and\nrotated-electron occupancies of the original lattice is a more complex problem, which\ndeserves and requires further studies. This is the main subject of the remaining of this\npaper.\nh\n3. The Ns1\n= 0 configuration state: s1 effective lattice, corresponding\nchange of gauge structure, and s1 bond-particle operators\n\nFor the square-lattice model in the one- and two-electron subspace the numbers Ns1 ,\nh\n= [NaDs1 \u2212 Ns1 ] are good quantum numbers whose values are fully\nNaDs1 , and Ns1\ncontrolled by those of Ssz , Ss , and Sc . We call configuration states the spinon occupancy\nconfigurations in the spin effective lattice which generate the spin degrees of freedom of\nthe energy eigenstates that span the one- and two-electron subspace. Such configuration\nstates refer to the overall occupancy of the Ns1 s1 bond particles over the NaDs1 sites of\nthe s1 effective lattice. Each configuration state refers to well-defined positions of the\nh\nNs1\nunoccupied sites. A x \u2265 0 and m = 0 ground state is an example of an energy\nh\neigenstate whose spin degrees of freedom are described by the Ns1\n= 0 configuration\nstate studied in the following.\nh\nWe start by considering the Ns1\n= [NaDs1 \u2212 Ns1 ] = 0 configuration state with no\nunoccupied sites in the spin and s1 effective lattices. It describes the spin degrees of\nfreedom of x \u2265 0 and m = 0 ground states and its charge excited states belonging to\nthe one- and two-electron subspace whose NaDs1 = NaDs /2 = (1 \u2212 x) NaD /2 sites of the s1\neffective lattice are occupied. Such a configuration state is described by suitable spinon\noccupancy configurations of the NaDs = (1 \u2212 x) NaD sites of the spin effective lattice.\n\n\fGround-state two-spinon bonds in the Hubbard model on a square lattice\n\n8\n\n3.1. Independent two-site one-link bonds\nFor simplicity we consider that Nas = (1\u2212x)1/D Na is an integer number yet if otherwise\none reaches the same results in the NaD \u226b 1 limit that our study refers to. For the model\non the square lattice the spin effective lattice is then a square lattice with Nas \u00d7 Nas\nsites. For the model on that lattice we consider torus periodic boundary conditions for\nthe spin effective lattice, alike for the original lattice. That implies periodic boundary\nconditions for the Nas rows and Nas columns. Periodic boundary conditions are also\nused for the one-chain spin effective lattice of the 1D model.\nThe spin effective lattice has in the present case two sub-lattices. The real-space\ncoordinates of the sites of each of such sub-lattices correspond to a possible choice of\nh\nthose of the s1 effective lattice. Indeed, there is for the Ns1\n= 0 configuration state a\ngauge \"symmetry\" between the representations in terms of the occupancies of the two\nalternative choices of real-space coordinates of the s1 effective lattice, which are found\nto refer to two alternative and equivalent representations of that state. We use the same\nnotation as Xiao-Gang Wen in Ref. [22] and say that there is a gauge structure when\nwe use simultaneously the real-space coordinates of the two corresponding choices of s1\nh\neffective lattices to label the Ns1\n= 0 configuration state. The real-space coordinates\n~rj of such two sub-lattices have j = 1, ..., NaDs1 sites, in either case the fundamental\ntranslation vectors being those given in Eq. (12). The real-space coordinates ~rj of the\ns1 bond particles are chosen to correspond to those of one of these two sub-lattices.\nThroughout the remaining of this paper we call sub-lattice 1 and sub-lattice 2 the subh\nlattice of the spin effective lattice of a Ns1\n= 0 configuration state whose real-space\ncoordinates are and are not the same as those of the s1 effective lattice, respectively.\nAn one-link bond connects two sites of the spin effective lattice whose spinons\nhave opposite spin projection and correspond to a two-site spin-singlet configuration\ndefined below. Each s1 bond particle is a suitable superposition of a well-defined set of\ntwo-site one-link bonds. Such a spin-singlet two-spinon s1 bond particle is related to\nthe resonating-valence-bond pictures for spin-singlet occupancy configurations of ground\nstates studied in Ref. [18, 19]. However, the s1 bond particle is well defined for all values\nof U/4t > 0 and not only for U/4t \u226b 1, consistently with its two spinons referring to\nspins of the sites singly occupied by rotated electrons. In contrast, most schemes used\npreviously for the Hubbard model or related models involving singly-occupied-site spins\nrefer in general to large values of U/4t \u226b 1 only [16, 12, 18, 22]. Here the s1 bond\nparticles have been constructed to inherently involving spinon occupancy configurations\nof sites of the spin effective lattice, which for U/4t > 0 refers only to the sites of the\noriginal lattice singly occupied by rotated electrons.\nFor simplicity we often call two-site link or just link a two-site one-link bond. For\nh\nthe Ns1\n= 0 configuration state studied here the above superposition includes 2D = 2, 4\nfamilies of two-site links, each family having Ns1 /2D different types of such links:\nNs1 /2D is the largest number of independent links with the same link centre that exist\nfor the above-considered boundary conditions. (Above and in the remaining of this\n\n\fGround-state two-spinon bonds in the Hubbard model on a square lattice\n\n9\n\npaper we denote often the number of family links by 2D = 2, 4 where two and four is\nthe number of such families for the model on the 1D and square lattice, respectively.)\nLink independence means here that for a given link centre all links involve different pairs\nof sites and each site belongs to one pair only.\nThe set of independent links with the same link centre belong to the same link\nfamily. Each one-link bond of a given family has some weight which in some cases may\nvanish. For a s1 bond particle of real-space coordinate ~rj there are 2D = 2, 4 families\n0\nof links. The links of each family are centered at one of the 2D = 2, 4 points ~rj + ~rd,l\nwhere the indexes d = 1, 2 for D = 2, d = 1 for D = 1, and l = \u00b11 uniquely define\n0\nthe link family. Here ~rd,l\nis the primary link vector. It connects the site of real-space\ncoordinate ~rj to the centre of the four (and two for 1D) links of real-space coordinate\n0\n~rj + ~rd,l\nin the spin effective lattice involving that site and its nearest-neighboring sites.\nNote that the former site and the latter four (and two for 1D) sites belong to sub-lattice\n1 and 2, respectively. On choosing one of the two sub-lattices of the spin effective lattice\nto be sub-lattice 1 and thus playing the role of s1 effective lattice and representing the\nstates in terms of the occupancy configurations of the latter lattice we say that there is\na change of gauge structure [22]. By considering all Ns1 /2D independent links for each\nof the 2D link centres needed to describe a s1 bond particle of real-space coordinate ~rj\nwe consider the most general situation, the exact configuration referring to some choice\nof the one-link bond weights considered below, some of which may vanish.\nA s1 bond particle of real-space coordinate ~rj involves Ns1 two-site one-link bonds\nconsistently with each family having Ns1 /2D links of different type. The link type is\nlabeled by an index g = 0, 1, ..., [Ns1/2D \u2212 1] uniquely defined below. Each link of a s1\ng\nbond particle of real-space coordinate ~rj involves two sites of coordinates ~r \u2212 ~rd,l\nand\ng\n0\n0\n~r + ~rd,l where ~rj = ~r \u2212~rd,l so that the link centre ~r \u2261 ~rj + ~rd,l is the middle point located\ng\nhalf-way between the two sites and the link vector ~rd,l\nis defined below. The real-space\ng\ng\ncoordinates ~rj = ~r \u2212 ~rd,l and ~r + ~rd,l belong to the sub-lattice 1 and sub-lattice 2 of the\ng\nspin effective lattice, respectively. For each family there are Ns1 /2D link vectors ~rd,l\nwhich for the square lattice read,\nas\ng\ng\n0\n0\n(13)\n~rd,l\n= ~rd,l\n+ T~d,l\n; ~rd,l\n= l ~exd ; g = 0, 1, ..., [Ns1/2D \u2212 1] ,\n2\ng\nwhere d = 1, 2, l = \u00b11, and T~d,l\nis a T vector. It has Cartesian components\ng\ng\ng\ng\ng\nT~d,l = [Td,l,1 , Td,l,2 ] for the square lattice and T~1,l\n= [T1,l,1\n] for 1D.

(13) apply to the 1D lattice as well provided that only\nthe index value d = 1 is considered.

Furthermore, T vectors T~d,l\nand T~dg\u2032 ,l\u2032 with the same value of g and d 6= d\u2032 and/or l 6= l\u2032 are related as follows,\n\"\n#\n\u0002\n\u0003\n0\n1\ng\n~ g\u2032 \u2032 ; \u03c3x =\nT~d,l\n= ll\u2032 \u03b4d,d\u2032 + \u03b4d,d\n,\n(18)\n \u0304 \u2032 \u03c3x T\nd ,l\n1 0\n\nwhere \u03c3x is the usual Pauli matrix.\nAs described below in terms of suitable operators, a s1 bond particle of real-space\ncoordinate ~rj is a superposition of Ns1 two-site one-link bonds each being associated\ng\nwith a link vector ~rd,l\n. For each site of the spin effective lattice there is exactly one\nother site of the same lattice such that the link connecting the two sites has centre\n0\nat ~rj + ~rd,l\n. Therefore, any link of the same family involves two sites of well-defined\ng\ng\n0\n0\nreal-space coordinate ~rj + ~rd,l\n\u2212 ~rd,l\nand ~rj + ~rd,l\n+ ~rd,l\n, which do not contribute together\nto any other link of the same family.\nAn important quantity is the distance between the two sites of a link which we\ncall link length or two-site bond length. It is independent of the real-space coordinate\ng\n0\n~r = ~rj + ~rd,l\nof the link centre and is fully determined by the link vector ~rd,l\nand thus\ndepends on the link type associated with the index g only. For D = 2 and D = 1 it\nreads,\np\ng\ng\n| = as (1+2N1 ) , (19)\n\u03beg \u2261 |2~rd,l\n| = as (1 + 2Nd )2 + (2Nd \u0304)2 ; \u03beg \u2261 |2x1,l\nrespectively. Its minimum and maximum values are,\n\u221a\nmin \u03beg = \u03be0 = as ; max \u03beg = 2 as (Nas /2 \u2212 1) + O(1/Na ) ,\n\n(20)\n\n\fGround-state two-spinon bonds in the Hubbard model on a square lattice\n\n11\n\nfor the square lattice and min \u03beg = \u03be0 = as and max \u03beg = as (Nas /2 \u2212 1) for 1D.\nFor 1D, links with different g have different link length \u03beg . In turn, for the square\nlattice there are links of different type and hence different g which have the same link\nlength \u03beg . Indeed, analysis of the link-length expression of Eq. (19) reveals that links\nwith different g value and numbers [Nd , Nd \u0304] and [Nd\u2032 , Nd\u2032 \u0304], respectively, such that Nd = Nd\u2032\nand Nd \u0304 = \u2212Nd\u2032 \u0304 have the same link length.\nThe set of values of the numbers\u221a N1 and N2 given in Eq. (14)\u221aimply that the\nmaximum value of the link length is D as (Nas /2 \u2212 1) rather than D as (Nas \u2212 1).\nIndeed and as mentioned above, the links contributing to a s1 bond particle of the\nh\nNs1\n= 0 configuration state are independent. It is then required that each link involves\ntwo sites that participate simultaneously in exactly one of such links. Within the torus\nrow and column periodic boundary conditions for the square spin effective lattice such a\nrequirement is fulfilled provided that the range of the numbers N1 and N2 is that given\nin Eq. (14).\nFor each family of two-site links associated with a s1 bond particle of real-space\ncoordinate ~rj there is a primary link. It corresponds to g = 0 and thus connects two\nnearest-neighboring sites of the spin effective lattice, one of them having the same real0\nspace coordinate ~rj = ~r \u2212 ~rd,l\nas the s1 bond particle. For primary links the link vector\ng\ng\n0\n0\n~rd,l reads ~rd,l = ~rd,l where the primary link vector ~rd,l\nis given in Eq. (13).\nFor the model on the square lattice there are four primary links, one per family.\n0\nTheir link vectors ~rd,l\nhave components such that N1 = N2 = 0 in Eqs. (13) and (14).\n0 = as . Alike the remaining links\nTherefore, the primary links have minimum length \u03be~rd,l\n0\nof its family, the centre of a primary link is located at ~r = ~rj + ~rd,l\n. For the square\n0\nlattice there are two horizontal primary links whose centers are located at ~rj + ~r1,l\nwith\n0\nl = \u00b11 and two vertical primary links whose centers are located at ~rj + ~r2,l with l = \u00b11.\nIn the case of the 1D lattice there are two primary links whose centers are located at\n0\n~rj + ~r1,l\nwith l = \u00b11.\n3.2. Partitions and g-primary partitions\nh\nThe building blocks of the Ns1\n= 0 configuration state are singlet pairs of spinons on\n\u2212\n+\nsites ~rj and ~rj of the spin effective lattice,\n\u0011\n1 \u0010\n|~rj\u2212 , ~rj+ i = \u221a | \u2191~rj\u2212 \u2193~rj+ i \u2212 | \u2193~rj\u2212 \u2191~rj+ i ,\n2\ng\n0\n~rj\u2213\n= ~rj + ~rd,l\n\u2213 ~rd,l\n; d = d(j) , l = l(j) , g = g(j) ,\n(21)\n\nwhere the values of the integer indexes d, l, and g are in the ranges d = 1, 2, l = \u00b11,\nand g \u2208 (0, Ns1 /2D \u2212 1), respectively, and are a function of the index j = 1, ..., Ns1 of\nthe real-space coordinate ~rj in the sublattice 1 of each s1 bond particle. Indeed, the two\nsites of such pairs of sites are connected by one-link bonds and each bond is associated\nwith exactly one s1 bond particle.\nEach connection involving Ns1 different bonds determines a partition. A partition\nis a 2Ns1 -spinon occupancy configuration where each site of the spin effective lattice is\n\n\fGround-state two-spinon bonds in the Hubbard model on a square lattice\n\n12\n\nFigure 1. Sub-domain of the spin effective lattice with a primary partition of d = 1\nhorizontal links for the model on the square lattice. The primary links are represented\nby the thick horizontal lines connecting two sites of the spin effective lattice. For a\nreference frame where the site located at the corner on the left-hand side and lower\nlimit of the squared sub-domain has Cartesian coordinates (0, 0) the family indices\nread d = 1, l = +1 if that site belongs to sub-lattice 2, whereas d = 1, l = \u22121 if\ninstead it belongs to sub-lattice 1.\n\nlinked to one site only and all 2Ns1 sites then correspond to Ns1 well-defined two-site\none-link bonds, each belonging to a different s1 bond particle.\nWe recall that a s1 bond particle involves the superposition of Ns1 such two-site\none-link bonds whereas a partition involves one two-site one-link bond from each of the\nNs1 s1 bond particles. Each s1 bond particle contributes with exactly one of its two-site\nbonds to a partition. In a partition any site of the spin effective lattice participates in\none bond only and there is a single link attached to each site which connects it to some\nother site. And the latter site is attached to the former site only.\nh\nThe Ns1\n= 0 configuration state is then represented as,\n|\u03c6i =\n\nX\nP\n\nCP\n\nNs1\nY\nj=1\n\n|~rj\u2212 , ~rj+ i ;\n\nCP =\n\nNs1\nY\n\nh\u2217g(j) ,\n\n(22)\n\nj=1\n\nwhere the coefficients hg are associated with the bond weights and appear in the bond\nQ s1 \u2212 +\noperators defined below, the product of singlet states N\n|~r , ~r i refers to a bond\nj=1\nPj j\nstate associated with a given partition, and the summation P is over all partitions.\nA particular type of partition involves Ns1 identical links. The indexes d, l, and g\nof identical links have the same values but correspond to s1 bond particles with different\nreal-space coordinates ~rj . Such a partition involves a set of Ns1 identical two-site onelink bonds whose links connect different sites of the spin effective lattice, each site being\nlinked to exactly one site. In this case the two real-space coordinates of the Ns1 pairs\ng\nof sites are connected by the same real-space vector 2~rd,l\nso that each bond link has the\nsame length.\nEach of the Ns1 bonds of a partition involves two sites of real-space coordinates ~rj \u2032\ng\nwhich belong to different sub-lattices where j \u2032 = 1, ..., Ns1 . The relation\nand ~rj \u2032 + 2~rd,l\nto the notation used above for the real-space coordinates of the two sites of a link is as\nfollows,\ng\n0\n\u2212 ~rd,l\n;\n~rj \u2032 = ~rj + ~rd,l\n\ng\ng\n0\n= ~rj + ~rd,l\n+ ~rd,l\n; j, j \u2032 = 1, ..., Ns1 , (23)\n~rj \u2032 + 2~rd,l\n\n\fGround-state two-spinon bonds in the Hubbard model on a square lattice\n\n13\n\nFigure 2. Sub-domain of the spin effective lattice with a primary partition of d = 2\nvertical links for the model on the square lattice. The primary links are represented by\nthe thick vertical lines connecting two sites of the spin effective lattice. As in Fig. 1,\nthe family indices read d = 2, l = +1 if the site of Cartesian coordinates (0, 0) belongs\nto sub-lattice 2, whereas d = 2, l = \u22121 if instead it belongs to sub-lattice 1.\n\nwhere both ~rj \u2032 and ~rj are real-space coordinates of the sub-lattice 1 and thus of the s1\neffective lattice. Except for a primary link one has that j 6= j \u2032 . The site of real-space\ncoordinate ~rj is that of the corresponding s1 bond particle. It is closest to the link\n0\ncentre at ~rj + ~rd,l\n. In turn, ~rj \u2032 is the real-space coordinate of one of the two sites of the\nspin effective lattice involved in the link.\nWhen a partition is a set of Ns1 identical primary links, all site pairs involve nearestneighboring sites of the spin effective lattice. It is then called a primary partition. The\nfamily of a primary partition is labeled by the indexes d and l of the corresponding\nidentical links. Figures 1 and 2 represent primary partitions of d = 1 horizontal and\nd = 2 vertical links, respectively, for a sub-domain of the spin effective lattice of the\nmodel on the square lattice.\nAn useful concept is that of a g-primary partition. It is defined as the superposition\nof the 2D = 2, 4 primary partitions. It follows that a g-primary partition contains\n2D Ns1 two-site primary links. In such a configuration each of the 2Ns1 sites of the\nspin-effective lattice has 2D = 2, 4 links attached to it. Figure 3 shows a sub-domain of\nh\n= 0 configuration state\nthe spin-effective lattice with the g-primary partition of the Ns1\nfor the model on the square lattice.\n3.3. The s1 bond-particle operators and the subspace they act onto\nThe spinon occupancy configurations considered above are similar to those associated\nwith multi-spin wave functions of spin-singlet states used by several authors [18, 20, 21].\nSuch wave functions are often constructed having as building blocks two-site and twospin spin-singlet configurations similar to that of Eq. (21) except that here the two spins\nrefer to sites singly occupied by rotated electrons and thus correspond to U/4t > 0 rather\nthan only to U/4t \u226b 1. In such schemes one also connects pairs of lattice sites with\nbonds and each such a connection determines a partition. However, here bonds involve\nsites of the spin effective lattice whereas those of previous related studies refer to the\nsites of the original lattice of the corresponding quantum problems.\nFor a given partition one can define a valence bond state [18, 20, 21] as a product of\n\n\fGround-state two-spinon bonds in the Hubbard model on a square lattice\n\n14\n\nFigure 3. Sub-domain of the spin-effective lattice representing the g-primary partition\nh\nof the Ns1\n= 0 configuration state for the model on the square lattice. The sites\nbelonging to the sub-lattice 1 are represented by filled circles. The horizontal (and\nvertical) thin and thick lines refer to d = 1 (and d = 2) l = +1 and l = \u22121 primary\nlinks, respectively. For the square lattice each site of the spin effective lattice has in a\ng-primary partition four links attached to it.\n\nsinglet states and represent an arbitrary singlet by a superposition of valence bond states\nof general form similar to that of Eq. (22). That involves a sum over all partitions of the\nlattice into set of pairs. However, for general wave functions such a decomposition works\nin general very badly. Indeed, valence-bond states are not orthogonal and their basis is\novercomplete. Fortunately, here each of the Ns1 two-site bonds of a partition belongs\nto a different s1 bond particle so that each of such particles contributes to a partition\nwith exactly one bond. Such a restriction eliminates the unwanted and unphysical\ncontributions and renders the bond states free of the overcompleteness problem.\nFor the one- and two-electron subspace and Na \u2192 \u221e, the operators g~rj ,s1 (and\n\u2020\ng~rj ,s1 ) which annihilate (and create) a s1 bond particle at a site of the spin effective\nlattice of real-space coordinate ~rj have the following general form both for the 1D and\nsquare lattices,\nNs1 /2D\u22121\n\ng~rj ,s1 =\n\nX\n\nhg a~rj ,s1,g ; g~r\u2020j ,s1 = g~rj ,s1\n\ng=0\n\na~rj ,s1,g =\n\nD X\nX\n\n0 ,s1,d,l,g ;\nb~rj +~rd,l\n\n\u0001\u2020\n\n,\n\nD = 1, 2 ,\n\n(24)\n\nd=1 l=\u00b11\n\nso that the expression of g~r\u2020j ,s1 involves the operators a~r\u2020j ,s1,g = a~rj ,s1,g\n(b~r,s1,d,l,g )\u2020 .\n\n\u0001\u2020\n\nand b~r\u2020,s1,d,l,g =\n\nThe operators a~r\u2020j ,s1,g and a~rj ,s1,g create and annihilate, respectively, a\n\nsuperposition of 2D = 2, 4 bonds of the same type and b~\u2020r,s1,d,l,g and b~r,s1,d,l,g are two-site\none-bond operators whose expression is given below.\nFor the square (and 1D) lattice the four (and two) primary links associated with the\noperators a~r\u2020j ,s1,0 and a~rj ,s1,0 are behind most of the spectral weight of a s1 bond particle\nof real-space coordinate ~rj . Consistently, the absolute value |hg | of the coefficients hg\nappearing in the expressions of such operators given in Eq. (24) decreases for increasing\n\n\fGround-state two-spinon bonds in the Hubbard model on a square lattice\n\n15\n\nlink length \u03beg .

The suitable use of this\nsum-rule and related symmetries leads though to useful information, as discussed below.\nBy definition the real-space coordinates ~rj of the s1 bond-particle operators of Eq. (24)\nare those of the sub-lattice 1.\nThe two-site one-bond operators b~r\u2020 ,s1,d,l,g and b~r,s1,d,l,g appearing in Eq. (24) are\nassociated with a well-defined link connecting the two sites of real-space coordinates\n~r \u2212 ~rd,l and ~r + ~rd,l , respectively.

Here the spinon operators are those given in Eq. (6). The\nsecond expression of Eq. (26) is obtained by the use of Eq. (8).\nThe phase factor (\u22121)d\u22121 which appears in the operator of Eq. (27) is associated\nwith the d-wave symmetry of the s1 bond-particle two-spinon pairing of the model on\nthe square lattice. The introduction of such a phase-factor refers to a self-consistent\nprocedure which follows from the d-wave symmetry of the spinon energy dispersion\nfound in Ref. [2] for the s1 fermions. Such objects emerge from the s1 bond particles\nstudied here through a suitable extended Jordan-Wigner transformation and their\nenergy-dispersion d-wave symmetry arises naturally from symmetries beyond the form\nof the operators introduced in Eqs. (26) and (27).\ng\ng\nAccording to the above discussions, the real-space coordinates ~r \u2212 ~rd,l\nand ~r + ~rd,l\ninvolved in the operators of Eqs. (26) and (27) correspond to two sites that belong to\n0\ndifferent sub-lattices of the spin effective lattice, ~r = ~rj + ~rd,l\nis the link centre, and\ng\n0\nthe primary link vector ~rd,l and link vector ~rd,l are given in Eqs. (13) and (14). In the\nconfiguration generated by the operator of Eq. (26) the two sites are singly-occupied by\nthe rotated electrons associated with the operators appearing in the first expression of\nthat equation.\n\n\fGround-state two-spinon bonds in the Hubbard model on a square lattice\n\n16\n\nh\nThe Ns1\n= 0 configuration state (22) can be written in terms of s1 bond-particle\noperators given in Eq. (24) as follows,\n\n|\u03c6i =\n\nNs1\nY\nj=1\n\ng~r\u2020j ,s1 |0s ; NaDs i ,\n\n(28)\n\nwhere |0s ; NaDs i is the spin SU(2) vacuum with NaDs = 2Ns1 independent +1/2 spinons on\nthe right-hand side of Eq. (4). It corresponds to a fully polarized spin-up configuration.\nThe subspace where the operators of Eqs. (24)-(27) act onto is defined by imposing the\nequality of the general configuration states given in Eqs. (22) and (28), respectively.\nSuch an equality implies several restrictions on the transitions generated by the two-site\none-bond operators (27) which are summarized in four corresponding rules for exclusion\nof unphysical and unwanted spin configurations given below. Before introducing such\nrules let us discuss several properties of the s1 bond-particle operators which follow from\nthe algebra given in Eqs. (A.7)-(A.9) of Appendix A for the basic spinon operators of\nthe two-site one-bond operators expressions provided in Eq. (27).\nThe s1 bond-particle operators g~r\u2020j ,s1 and g~rj ,s1 of Eq. (24) involve a sum of Ns1 twosite one-bond operators of general form given in Eq. (27) with Ns1 /2D of such operators\nh\nper family. The number of unoccupied sites Ns1\nof Eq. (9) refers to a subspace with\nconstant number Ns1 of s1 bond particles. In turn, the creation and annihilation of one\ns1 bond particle by application of these operators, respectively, onto the ground state\ninvolves a superposition of Ns1 elementary processes, which do not conserve the number\nof these objects. Each such an elementary process is generated by an operator b~\u2020r,s1,d,l,g\nand b~r,s1,d,l,g , respectively, whose expression is given in Eq. (27).\nWithin the present LWS representation, application of the rotated-electron\noperators of Eq. (26) onto two unoccupied sites of the original lattice generates\ntwo virtual processes. The first process involves creation of two c fermions and two\nindependent +1/2 spinons. The second process refers to creation of a spin-singlet twosite and two-spinon configuration upon annihilation of two independent +1/2 spinons.\nIndeed, from analysis of the expression provided in Eq. (27), one finds that application\ng\ng\nof the operator b~\u2020r,s1,d,l,g onto the sites of real-space coordinates ~r \u2212 ~rd,l\nand ~r + ~rd,l\ngives\nzero except when those sites are both occupied by an independent +1/2 spinon. This\nis consistent with a \"unoccupied site\" referring to two sites of the spin effective lattice\ng\ng\nwith real-space coordinates ~r \u2212 ~rd,l\nand ~r + ~rd,l\n, respectively, which are occupied by\nindependent +1/2 spinons in the initial configuration state.\nAs confirmed in Section 4 and consistently with the studies of Ref. [2], for\nexcitations involving transitions between configuration states where a s1 bond particle\nmoves around in the spin effective lattice by elementary processes which conserve the\nh\nnumbers Ns1 and Ns1\n, an independent +1/2 spinon plays the role of an unoccupied site\nof the s1 and spin effective lattices. In contrast, in elementary processes involving the\ncreation of a s1 bond particle the two annihilated independent +1/2 spinons play the role\nof a \"unoccupied site\", which becomes occupied in the final occupancy configuration.\nAccording to the operator expression provided in Eq. (27), upon acting onto the\n\n\fGround-state two-spinon bonds in the Hubbard model on a square lattice\n\n17\n\nh\nFigure 4. Small sub-domain of two g-primary partitions associated with Ns1\n= 0 and\nh\nNs1 = 2 configuration states for the model on the square lattice. In the configuration\nof the figure on the left-hand side the filled circle at the middle of the sub-domain\ncorresponds to the site whose real-space coordinate ~rj is that of the s1 bond particle.\nAnnihilation of that object leads to the configuration on the figure right-hand side.\nNote that for a primary g-basic partition this is equivalent to the suppression of the\nfour links attached to the above site of real-space coordinate ~rj .\n\nindependent-spinon occupancies the operator b~r\u2020,s1,d,l,g generates a superposition of two\nconfigurations. For one of these configurations the elementary process generated by that\ng\noperator flips the spin of the spinon at site ~r +~rd,l\nand checks that the spin of the spinon\ng\nat site ~r \u2212 ~rd,l remains up. The elementary process generating the other configuration\ng\nflips the spin of the spinon at site ~r \u2212 ~rd,l\nand checks that the spin of the spinon at site\ng\n~r + ~rd,l remains up. The relative phase factor \u22121 of the two configurations insures that\nthe s1 bond particle created by the operator g~r\u2020j ,s1 of Eq. (24) is a suitable superposition\nof spin-singlet configurations.\nh\nFigure 4 shows a small sub-domain of two g-primary partitions of Ns1\n= 0 and\nh\nNs1 = 2 configuration states. In the configuration on the figure left-hand side the\nfilled circle at the middle of the sub-domain corresponds to a site whose real-space\ncoordinate ~rj is that of a s1 bond particle. Application of the annihilation operator\ng~rj ,s1 of Eq. (24) onto that g-primary partition occurs through the operator a~rj ,s1,0 also\ngiven in that equation. That leads to the configuration on the figure right-hand side.\nHence annihilation of the s1 bond particle is for a g-primary partition equivalent to the\nsuppression of the four links attached to the above site of real-space coordinate ~rj .\nA superficial analysis of the configurations shown in Fig. 4 seems to indicate that\nh\nthere is one unoccupied site in the sub-domain of the final Ns1\n= 2 configuration state.\nHowever, if instead of the g-primary partition one considers the corresponding four\nprimary partitions one finds that there are two nearest-neighboring unoccupied sites.\nFor the d = 1 and d = 2 primary partitions these two sites belong to the same row and\ncolumn, respectively, as further discussed in Section 4.\nConcerning the application onto spin configurations of two-site one-bond operators\nand four-site two-bond operators, the restrictions arising from imposing that the\nh\nrepresentations of the Ns1\n= 0 configuration state given in Eqs. (22) and (28),\nrespectively, are identical correspond to the following four rules whose fulfillment\nprevents the generation of unwanted and unphysical spin configurations:\nFirst rule according to which application onto a spin configuration of a two-site\none-bond operator b~\u2020r,s1,d,l,g or b~r,s1,d,l,g generates a physical spin configuration provided\ng\ng\nthat its sites of real-space coordinates ~r \u2212 ~rd,l\nand ~r + ~rd,l\n, respectively, are in the initial\n\n\fGround-state two-spinon bonds in the Hubbard model on a square lattice\n\n18\n\nspin configuration (i) occupied by independent +1/2 spinons or (ii) linked by a bond.\nSecond rule states that application onto a spin configuration of any of the elementary\nfour-site two-bond operators b~\u2020r,s1,d,l,g b~\u2020r\u2032 ,s1,d\u2032 ,l\u2032,g\u2032 , b~r,s1,d,l,g b~r\u2020\u2032 ,s1,d\u2032,l\u2032 ,g\u2032 , b~r,s1,d,l,g b~r\u2032 ,s1,d\u2032 ,l\u2032 ,g\u2032 ,\nand b~r\u2020,s1,d,l,g b~r\u2032 ,s1,d\u2032,l\u2032 ,g\u2032 gives zero when one of the two sites of real-space coordinates\ng\ng\n~r \u2212 ~rd,l\nand ~r + ~rd,l\n, respectively, is the same as one of the two sites of real-space\n\u2032\ng\u2032\n\u2032\ncoordinates ~r \u2212~rd\u2032 ,l\u2032 and ~r\u2032 +~rdg\u2032 ,l\u2032 . Hence only when the two two-site one-bond operators\nof such four-site operators do not join sites or join both sites their application onto a\nspin configuration generates physical spin configurations.\nThird rule according to which when the two two-site one-bond operators\nof an elementary four-site two-bond operator b~\u2020r,s1,d,l,g b~\u2020r\u2032 ,s1,d\u2032 ,l\u2032 ,g\u2032 , b~r,s1,d,l,g b~\u2020r\u2032 ,s1,d\u2032 ,l\u2032 ,g\u2032 ,\nb~r,s1,d,l,g b~r\u2032 ,s1,d\u2032,l\u2032 ,g\u2032 , and b~\u2020r ,s1,d,l,g b~r\u2032 ,s1,d\u2032 ,l\u2032 ,g\u2032 , correspond (i) to different s1 bond particles so\n0\nthat in the real-space coordinates ~r = ~rj + ~rd,l\nand ~r\u2032 = ~rj \u2032 + ~rd0\u2032 ,l\u2032 of their link centres,\nrespectively, one has that j = j \u2032 or (ii) to the same s1 bond particle and to the same\n\u2032\ng\nsites so that ~r \u00b1 ~rd,l\n= ~r\u2032 \u00b1 ~rdg\u2032 ,l\u2032 the first rule applies independently to each of such\ntwo-site one-bond operators provided that in case (i) the second rule is obeyed.\nForth rule refers to when the real-space coordinates of the link centres of the two-site\none-bond operators of any of the four elementary four-site two-bond operators considered\n0\nin the third rule are given by ~r = ~rj + ~rd,l\nand ~r\u2032 = ~rj + ~rd0\u2032 ,l\u2032 , respectively, so that\nsuch two-site one-bond operators correspond to the same s1 bond particle of real-space\n\u2032\ng\ncoordinate ~rj but ~rd,l\n6= ~rdg\u2032 ,l\u2032 and states that then there are two cases. When in the\ninitial spin configuration where the operators b~\u2020r,s1,d,l,g b~\u2020r\u2032 ,s1,d\u2032,l\u2032 ,g\u2032 and b~r,s1,d,l,g b~r\u2020\u2032 ,s1,d\u2032 ,l\u2032 ,g\u2032\n(and b~r,s1,d,l,g b~r\u2032 ,s1,d\u2032 ,l\u2032 ,g\u2032 and b~\u2020r ,s1,d,l,g b~r\u2032 ,s1,d\u2032 ,l\u2032 ,g\u2032 ) act onto the sites of the spin effective\n\u2032\n\u2032\nlattice of real-space coordinates ~rj + ~rd0\u2032 ,l\u2032 \u2212 ~rdg\u2032 ,l\u2032 and ~rj + ~rd0\u2032 ,l\u2032 + ~rdg\u2032 ,l\u2032 are linked by\na bond (and occupied by two independent +1/2 spinons) then a physical final spin\ng\n0\nconfiguration is generated provided that the sites of real-space coordinates ~rj + ~rd,l\n\u2212~rd,l\ng\n0\nand ~rj + ~rd,l\n+ ~rd,l\nare (i) occupied by two independent +1/2 spinons or (ii) linked\nby a bond. In turn, when in the initial spin configuration where these four-site twobond operators act onto the sites of the spin effective lattice of real-space coordinates\n\u2032\n\u2032\n~rj + ~rd0\u2032 ,l\u2032 \u2212 ~rdg\u2032 ,l\u2032 and ~rj + ~rd0\u2032 ,l\u2032 + ~rdg\u2032 ,l\u2032 are occupied by two independent +1/2 spinons\n(and linked by a bond) then a physical final spin configuration is generated provided\ng\ng\n0\n0\nthat their sites of real-space coordinates ~rj + ~rd,l\n\u2212 ~rd,l\nand ~rj + ~rd,l\n+ ~rd,l\nare linked by\na bond (and occupied by two independent +1/2 spinons).\nSuch rules follow naturally from the definition of the subspace where the operators of\nEqs. (24)-(27) act onto. The main criterion is that such operators have been constructed\nto inherently generating a faithful representation provided that the corresponding state\nh\n(28) represents the Ns1\n= 0 configuration state and hence is identical to that given\nin Eq. (22) with the same value of Ns1 = NaDs1 . For instance, the second rule results\nfrom all partitions of the summation on the right-hand side of Eq. (22) a site of the\nspin effective lattice being linked to exactly only one site. Indeed, in a given partition\n\n\fGround-state two-spinon bonds in the Hubbard model on a square lattice\n\n19\n\nno two-site one bonds join the same site. Furthermore, the third rule refers to foursite two-bond operators whose two two-site one-bond operators belong to the same s1\nbond-particle operator g~r\u2020j ,s1 or g~rj ,s1 yet correspond to different pairs of sites of the\nspin effective lattice. Such four-site two-bond operators appear in the expressions of\nthe s1 bond-particle operators [g~r\u2020j ,s1 ]2 or [g~rj ,s1]2 , respectively, which as confirmed in\nAppendix A give zero when acting onto the subspace which the operators of Eqs. (24)(27) refer to. The point is that when in the initial spin configuration where the operators\nb~\u2020r,s1,d,l,g b~\u2020r\u2032 ,s1,d\u2032,l\u2032 ,g\u2032 and b~r,s1,d,l,g b~r\u2020\u2032 ,s1,d\u2032,l\u2032 ,g\u2032 (and b~r,s1,d,l,g b~r\u2032 ,s1,d\u2032 ,l\u2032 ,g\u2032 and b~\u2020r,s1,d,l,g b~r\u2032 ,s1,d\u2032 ,l\u2032 ,g\u2032 )\n\u2032\nact onto the sites of the spin effective lattice of real-space coordinates ~rj + ~rd0\u2032 ,l\u2032 \u2212 ~rdg\u2032 ,l\u2032\n\u2032\nand ~rj + ~rd0\u2032 ,l\u2032 + ~rdg\u2032 ,l\u2032 are occupied by two independent +1/2 spinons (and linked by a\nbond) the operator on the right-hand side of g~r\u2020j ,s1 g~r\u2020j ,s1 and g~rj ,s1 g~r\u2020j ,s1 (and g~rj ,s1g~rj ,s1\nand g~r\u2020j ,s1g~rj ,s1 ) which such four-site two-bond operators belong to, respectively, has\ntransformed that configuration into an intermediate virtual state where such sites are\nlinked by a bond (and occupied by two independent +1/2 spinons).\nh\nThe Ns1\n= 0 configuration state is given exactly by the same superposition of\npartitions when the real-space coordinates ~rj of the s1 bond-particle operators of Eq.\n(24) where j = 1, ..., NaDs1 are chosen to refer to any of the two sub-lattices of the\nspin effective lattice. That property is straightforwardly confirmed for the g-primary\npartition represented in Fig. 3 and is fulfilled provided that one sums over all possible\npartitions. Hence, whether the above real-space coordinates are those of one or the\nother of such sub-lattices, the occupancy configuration associated with the creation\nof the Ns1 = NaDs /2 bond particles is exactly the same. This confirms that the two\nh\ncorresponding choices for the s1 effective lattice describe the same Ns1\n= 0 configuration\nstate so that there is a gauge structure.

The physical range of the\nexponent \u03b1s1 corresponds typically to R2D > 0.9 so that the primary links are behind\nmost of the s1 bond-particle spectral weight.

For \u03b1s1 slightly larger than 5D/4 where D = 1, 2 the ratios R1D (D = 1) and\nR2D (D = 2) are larger than 0.9.\nFor Na \u2192 \u221e the exact coefficients |hg | are decreasing functions of the link length\nwhose expressions most likely are not, at least for the whole link-length range, of the\nsimple form given in Eqs.

Hence for the square lattice one expects that \u03b1s1 > 2.5 so that the ratio R2D is\nlarger than 0.9 and the primary links are behind most of the spectral weight of the s1\nbond particle, alike for the 1D lattice for \u03b1s1 > 1.25.\nh\nHere we considered the Ns1\n= 0 configuration state where all sites of the s1 effective\nlattice are occupied.

The Ns1\n= 1, 2 configuration states and the kink-like and anti-kink-like\nlink occupancies associated with the unoccupied sites\n\nThe one- and two-electron subspace considered in this paper is spanned by states with\nnone, one, and two s1 effective-lattice unoccupied sites. There are several configuration\nstates with one or two unoccupied sites in that lattice so that such sites can move around\nin it. We recall that such a motion is independent of that of the rotated electrons that\nsingly occupy sites of the original lattice relative to the rotated-electron unoccupied and\ndoubly-occupied sites of that lattice. The latter are instead described by the motion of\nthe c fermions whose occupancy configurations correspond to the state representations\nof the charge global U(1) symmetry. In turn, the configuration states associated with\nthe motion around in the s1 and effective lattices of the s1 bond particles relative to\ntheir unoccupied sites refer to state representations of the global spin SU(2) symmetry.\nThe global \u03b7-spin SU(2) symmetry does not play any role in the one- and two-electron\nsubspace, since it corresponds to a single occupancy configuration (x > 0) or none\noccupancy configurations (x = 0) for all states which span that subspace. For x > 0\nthis is the \u03b7-spin vacuum on the right-hand side of Eq. (4), which is invariant under the\nelectron - rotated-electron unitary transformation. For x = 0 one has that NaD\u03b7 = 0 so\nthat the \u03b7-spin effective lattice does not exist.\nAnalysis of the transformation laws of the objects whose occupancy configurations\ngenerate the energy eigenstates of the square-lattice model in the one- and two-electron\nsubspace [2] reveals that the excited states generated by application onto x \u2265 0 and\nm = 0 ground states of one- and two-electron operators have one unoccupied site\nand none or two unoccupied sites in the s1 effective lattice, respectively. The energy\neigenstates that span such a subspace are generated in Ref. [2] by c and s1 fermions\nmomentum occupancy configurations. The s1 fermion occupancies in the s1 momentum\nband introduced in Ref. [2] that generate energy eigenstates with one and two s1 band\nh\nh\nholes can be expressed as suitable superpositions of the set of Ns1\n= 1 and Ns1\n= 2\nconfiguration states, respectively, studied in the following.\n\n\fGround-state two-spinon bonds in the Hubbard model on a square lattice\n\n22\n\nh\nThe structure of the Ns1\n= 0 configuration states is simpler than that of the\nh\nNs1 = 1, 2 configuration states. A key property simplifies the study of the latter states:\nThere is an one-to-one correspondence between the occupancies of the Ns1 occupied sites\nh\nof the s1 effective lattice of the partitions of a Ns1\n= 0 configuration state and those of\nh\nthe occupied sites of the s1 effective lattice of partitions of the Ns1\n= 1, 2 configuration\nstates with the same number Ns1 of s1 bond particles. The point is that except for a\nchange in the real-space coordinates of some of the sites, the link configurations of the\nsites of the spin effective lattice in one-to-one correspondence with each other remain\nunaltered.\nh\n4.1. Ns1\n= 1 g-primary partitions of the four sub-configuration states\n\nWe start our analysis by considering the configuration states with one unoccupied site.\nThe s1 fermion momentum occupancy of excited [N\u2191 \u2212 N\u2193 ] = 1 states of x \u2265 0 and\nm = 0 ground states generated by application of one-electron operators onto the latter\nh\nstates is described by a suitable superposition of the set of Ns1\n= 1 configuration states\nstudied in the following. For such configuration states the unoccupied site is associated\nwith their single independent +1/2 spinon. For simplicity we have considered above\nh\nthat for the Ns1\n= 0 configuration state the number of sites NaDs = 2Sc = Nc of the\nspin effective lattice is such that Nas is for D = 2 an integer so that the spin effective\nlattice is a square lattice. In turn, for configuration states with one unoccupied site the\nnumber NaDs of sites of the spin effective lattice is odd so that for D = 2 the designation\nNaDs is not to be understood to imply that the number Nas is an integer.\nWe recall that the number of sites of the spin effective lattice is given by NaDs =\n2Sc = Nc where Sc is the eigenvalue of the generator of the global U(1) symmetry\nS\u0303c = V\u0302 \u2020 \u015cc V\u0302 , \u015cc = Q\u0302/2, the operator Q\u0302 is given in Eq. (3), and Nc is the number of\nc fermions. Since Sc is a half-off-integer, according to the studies of Ref. [6] the global\nSO(3)\u00d7SO(3)\u00d7U(1) symmetry of the present quantum problem implies that the \u03b7-spin\nS\u03b7 and spin Ss are half-off-integers as well. It follows that the number of sites of the s1\neffective lattice is according to Eq. (9) given by NaDs1 = [NaDs /2 + Ss ] where Ss = 1/2.\nOut of those, Ns1 = [NaDs1 \u2212Ss ] are occupied by s1 bond particles and one is unoccupied,\nh\nconsistently with Ns1\n= 2Ss = 1. Hence such states have also one unoccupied site in\nthe s1 effective lattice.\nh\nFor the study of the Ns1\n= 0 configuration state we considered in Section 3 a\nchange of gauge structure such that the real-space coordinates of the sites of the s1\neffective lattice correspond to one of the two sub-lattices of the spin effective lattice.\nThe results of Ref. [2] confirm that for the limit NaD \u226b 1 and hole concentrations x such\nthat (1 \u2212 x) \u2265 1/NaD the two choices of s1 effective lattice lead to the same quantum\nnumbers for the whole one- and two-electron subspace.\nh\nLet us consider Ns1\n= 1 configuration states whose spin effective lattice has 2Ns1 +1\nsites and for the model on the square lattice the spin effective lattice of the corresponding\nh\nNs1\n= 0 configuration state with the same number Ns1 of s1 bond particles is a square\n\n\fGround-state two-spinon bonds in the Hubbard model on a square lattice\n\n23\n\nlattice and has Nas \u00d7 Nas = 2Ns1 sites. For the present NaDs \u2192 \u221e limit the correct\nphysics is then achieved if one considers that out of the 2Ns1 + 1 sites of the spin\nh\neffective lattice of such Ns1\n= 1 configuration states, 2Ns1 sites correspond to a square\nlattice and the position of the extra site is well defined and given below. The latter site\ndoes not belong to the square lattice formed by the remaining 2Ns1 sites of the spin\neffective lattice and has suitable boundary conditions such that it is the unoccupied site\nof the s1 effective lattice. However, for the spin effective lattice the extra site and the\nunoccupied site are not always the same site, as discussed below.\nFor the square (and 1D) lattice the extra site boundary conditions are compatible\nand consistent with the periodic boundary conditions of each row and column (and\nh\nchain). For the Ns1\n= 0 configuration state of the model on the square lattice such a\nrow and column periodic boundary conditions imply torus periodic boundary conditions\nfor the spin effective lattice. Here the presence of the extra site slightly affects the latter\nh\nboundary conditions. Hence the spin effective lattice of Ns1\n= 1 configuration states has\nno pure torus periodic boundary conditions. Within the extra-site boundary conditions\nh\ngiven below each Ns1\n= 1 configuration state has for the square (and 1D) lattice four\n(and two) sub-configuration states. The spin effective lattice is the same for all such\nsub-configuration states. The concepts of a partition and g-partition remain the same\nh\nas for the corresponding Ns1\n= 0 configuration state, except that now there is an extra\nsite.\nFor the model on the square lattice the extra site of the spin effective lattice belongs\nto the row or column that for a d = 1 and d = 2 primary partition specified below,\nrespectively, the unoccupied site belongs to. The real-space coordinate of the extra site\nand its Cartesian coordinates are denoted by,\n~rj0 = [x01 , x02 ] .\n\n(33)\n\nIn the present Na \u2192 \u221e limit the following periodic conditions yield the correct physics\nand assure that the extra site is uniquely defined and the same site for all partitions of\nh\na given Ns1\n= 1 configuration state,\nx0d = x0d + l (L + a) ;\n\nx0d \u0304 = x0d \u0304 ;\n\nd = 1, 2 , l = \u00b11 ,\n\n(34)\n\nwhere the index d \u0304 = 1, 2 is defined as in Eq. (14). Such boundary conditions apply to\nthe square lattice for d = 1, 2 and l = \u00b11 and to the 1D lattice for d = 1 and l = \u00b11.\nFor the row (d = 1) [and column (d = 2) for the model on the square lattice] the extra\nsite belongs to, they are equivalent to periodic boundary conditions. Indeed that row\n[and column] has Na + 1 sites and hence its length is L + a = (Na + 1) a.\nFor each sub-configuration state there is exactly one g-primary partition, which is a\nsuperposition of the corresponding four primary partitions. Hence instead of 2D = 2, 4\nh\nprimary partitions, for a Ns1\n= 1 configuration state there are 8D = 8, 16 primary\npartitions. For all partitions of the summation on the right-hand side of Eq. (22)\nthe extra site has the same Cartesian coordinates. Nonetheless, the extra site and the\nunoccupied site are not the same site of the spin effective lattice for all such partitions.\n\n\fGround-state two-spinon bonds in the Hubbard model on a square lattice\n\n24\n\nFor instance, the extra site and the unoccupied site are the same site for three out of\nthe four primary partitions of a primary g-basic partition, as confirmed below.\nFor the model on the square lattice the periodic boundary conditions of the sites\nbelonging to rows and columns other than that of the extra site refer to a length L rather\nthan L + a. For the extra site the boundary conditions (34) apply to both the square\nand 1D lattice and are valid for the 2D = 2, 4 sub-configuration states considered below.\nIn turn, for the model on the square lattice and concerning the remaining sites of the\nextra-site row and column such periodic boundary conditions apply to those belonging\nto the row for horizontal sub-configuration states and to the column for vertical subconfiguration states, respectively. For horizontal (and vertical) sub-configuration states\nthe sites of the extra-site column (and row) obey periodic boundary conditions associated\ninstead with the length L, alike the sites that do not belong to the extra-site column and\nrow. That the periodic boundary conditions of one row or column of the spin effective\nlattice refer to the length L + a rather than L is for the model on the square lattice\nbehind the above deviation from the pure torus periodic boundary conditions.\nExcept for the unoccupied site, the remaining 2Ns1 sites of the spin effective lattice\nare occupied by Ns1 s1 bond particles. Furthermore, out of the 2Ns1 + 1 sites of\nthat lattice, for the 2Ns1 sites other than the extra site, which for some partitions\nh\nis not the unoccupied site, there are two well-defined sub-lattices, alike for the Ns1\n=0\nconfiguration state. Indeed, the extra site belongs to the spin effective lattice but does\nnot belong to any of these two sub-lattices. Moreover, now sub-lattice 1 is that whose\nreal-space coordinates are the same as those of the sites of the s1 effective lattice whose\nrow or column are not that of the extra site. In turn, for horizontal (and vertical) subconfiguration states the occupied sites of the s1 effective lattice of the extra-site row\n(and column) belong instead to sub-lattice 2.\nThe s1 bond-particle operators act onto a subspace with constant values NaDs =\n2Sc = Nc of spin-effective-lattice sites. Therefore, suitable analysis of the general\nexpressions of the number of sites and unoccupied sites of the \u03b1\u03bd effective lattices\n[2] reveal that for \u03b1\u03bd = s1 one of these operators or products of such operators can\nh\neither is conserved or changes by an even\ngenerate transitions where the value of Ns1\nnumber. Indeed, transitions where such a value changes by an odd number imply that\nthat of the number NaDs = 2Sc = Nc of both spin-effective-lattice sites and c fermions\nh\nh\nalso changes. For instance, transitions from the Ns1\n= 0 configuration state to a Ns1\n=1\nconfiguration state involve creation or annihilation of one electron. Hence they involve\ncreation or annihilation of one rotated electron as well. In terms of the objects of our\ndescription that process involves creation or annihilation, respectively, of a c fermion\nplus creation of an independent spinon [2]. In the LWS representation the latter is an\nindependent +1/2 spinon whose creation is equivalent to adding an extra site to the\nspin effective lattice.\nTherefore, addition of the extra site is a process beyond the s1 bond-particle algebra\nwhose operators are well defined for subspaces with constant values of NaDs = 2Sc = Nc\nspin-effective-lattice sites only. Fortunately, our general description also accounts for\n\n\fGround-state two-spinon bonds in the Hubbard model on a square lattice\n\n25\n\nsuch a process, which involves both creation or annihilation of a c fermion and creation\nof an independent +1/2 spinon. In turn, the generators of the transitions between\nh\ndifferent Ns1\n= 1 configuration states involve s1 bond-particle operators only. Such\ntransitions are equivalent to the motion around in the spin effective lattice of s1 bond\nparticles. But since in the present case there is a single unoccupied site it is often more\nconvenient to describe such a motion in terms of those of that site.\nThe unoccupied site has the same position in the s1 effective lattice and g-primary\npartitions of the 2D = 2, 4 sub-configuration states. Such a position is the same as\nthat of the extra site in the spin effective lattice. For each position of the extra\nh\nsite in that lattice there is a Ns1\n= 1 configuration state. Specifically, there are\nD\nD\nNas1 = [Nas /2 + Ss ] = Ns1 + 1 such configuration states. The s1 fermion occupancies of\nRef. [2] of the above mentioned excited states generated by application onto x \u2265 0 and\nm = 0 ground states of one-electron operators can be expresed as suitable superpositions\nof such NaDs1 = [NaDs /2 + Ss ] = Ns1 + 1 configuration states. For the model on the square\nh\nlattice the four sub-configuration states of each of such Ns1\n= 1 configuration states\nare called horizontal-kink, horizontal-anti-kink, vertical-kink, and vertical-anti-kink subconfiguration state.\nh\n= 2 configuration states of Subsection 4-5 to\nIt useful for the description of the Ns1\nh\nintroduce the Ns1 = 1 g-primary partition of the horizontal-kink sub-configuration state\nas a limiting case of a general configuration whose unoccupied site and extra site do not\nhave the same real-space coordinate in the s1 effective lattice. The g-primary partition of\nthe above sub-configuration state is then reached by considering the particular case when\nthe unoccupied and extra site are the same site. As discussed below, the unoccupied\nsite of a g-primary partition (and that of the underlying s1 effective lattice) is identified\nwith the unoccupied site of three out of its four primary partitions. A sub-domain of the\nspin-effective lattice with a part of such a general g-primary partition is shown in Fig. 7\nfor the square lattice. Its extra site is not shown in the sub-domain under consideration\nand is not the unoccupied site marked by the open circle. The occupied sites of the s1\neffective lattice are represented by filled circles.\nThe row kink-like link occupancy starting on the right-hand side of the unoccupied\nsite ends at the extra site. We say that such a link occupancy and those of the\nsurrounding rows have opposite signs. Indeed, the s1 bond-particle sites of the row part\nassociated with the former occupancy belong to sublattice 2 of the spin effective lattice\nwhereas those of the s1 bond particles on the surrounding rows belong to sublattice 1.\nThe g-primary partition of the horizontal-kink sub-configuration state corresponds\nto a particular case of that represented in Fig. 7 whose extra and unoccupied site are the\nsame site so that the kink-like link occupancy extends over the whole unoccupied-site\nrow. Figure 8 shows a sub-domain of the spin-effective lattice representing the g-primary\nh\npartition of the Ns1\n= 1 horizontal-kink sub-configuration state for the square lattice.\nSince one of the issues to be further discussed is the periodic boundary conditions of the\nextra-site row, for simplicity the Nas \u226b 1 sites of a row are represented in Fig. 8 by a\nfew sites. The last site of each row is marked by a X to indicate that it is the same site\n\n\fGround-state two-spinon bonds in the Hubbard model on a square lattice\n\n26\n\nFigure 7.

However, in the link configuration\nshown here the unoccupied site does not coincide with the extra site so that the\nformer site plays the role of a mobile domain wall, alike for some g-primary partitions\nh\nof Ns1\n= 2 configuration states considered in Subsection 4-5. The horizontal (and\nvertical) thin and thick lines refer to d = 1 (and d = 2) l = +1 and l = \u22121 primary\nlinks, respectively. For the d = 1, l = +1 partition the unoccupied site is that attached\nto three links. In turn, for the d = 2, l = \u00b11 partitions and d = 1, l = \u22121 partition\nthe unoccupied site is that which has a single link attached to it. The latter site is\nmarked by an open circle in the figure and plays the role of unoccupied site of the s1\neffective lattice. The occupied sites of that lattice are represented by filled circles. The\nextra site does not belong to the sub-domain shown here and marks the end of the\nhorizontal kink-like link occupancy located on the right-hand side of the unoccupied\nsite.\n\nas the first site of the same row. In turn, for the vertical direction the figure represents\na sub-domain only so that no equivalent sites are included, alike for the sub-domain\nshown in Fig. 7. Note that for the extra-site row of Fig. 8 the extra site is marked by a\nX and thus is the same as the unoccupied site marked by an open circle. Therefore and\nin contrast to Fig. 7, in Fig. 8 the kink-like link configuration extends over the whole\nextra-site row.\nBoth for the d = 2, l = \u00b11 primary partitions and d = 1, l = \u22121 primary partition\nof the g-primary partition shown in Fig. 8 and that of Fig. 7 the unoccupied site\nis the site attached to a single link, marked by the open circle in both figures.

The site marked by the open circle plays the role\nof the unoccupied site of both the g-primary partition and s1 effective lattice of the four\nsub-configuration states.\nFor the g-primary partition of the horizontal-kink sub-configuration state we call\nkink row or 1, +1 line the link occupancy of the sites belonging to the same row as\nthe unoccupied site.

For the vertical direction only part of the configuration is shown. In\nturn, for the horizontal direction the Nas \u226b 1 sites of a row are represented by a few\nsites. Indeed, one of the goals of the figure is to illustrate the row periodic boundary\nconditions, a site marked by a X being the same as the first site on the left-hand site of\nthe same row. For instance, the unoccupied site marked by an open circle is the same\nsite as the last site on the right-hand site of the same row. Note that the extra-site\nrow has one more site than the remaining rows and such a site is both the extra site\nand the unoccupied site so that the kink-like link configuration extends over the whole\nextra-site row, in contrast to the configuration shown in Fig. 7. On the other hand,\nthe link configurations associated with the unoccupied site are the same as in Fig. 7.\nFor the d = 1, l = +1 primary partition the unoccupied site is that attached to three\nlinks and for the d = 2, l = \u00b11 primary partitions and d = 1, l = \u22121 primary partition\nthat which has a single link attached to it.\n\nthree links.

Such mobile\nh\ndomain walls occur in some Ns1\n= 2 sub-configuration states with two unoccupied sites\nh\non the same row or column rather than in Ns1\n= 1 sub-configuration states. However,\nthe link structure of the unoccupied site is the same as for the latter states.\n\nSubsection 4-5, such sub-domains involve unoccupied-site mobile domains walls which\nh\noccur in Ns1\n= 2 sub-configuration states when the two unoccupied sites belong to the\nsame row or column. However, the link structure associated with the unoccupied site at\nthe center of each of such sub-domains is that also occurring in the g-primary partitions\nh\nof the four Ns1\n= 1 sub-configuration states, respectively. In turn, each of these subdomains includes four primary links of a s1 bond particle with a single link attached\nto the unoccupied site. As confirmed for the horizontal-kink sub-configuration state\non comparing it with the link occupancy configurations of Fig. 8, the only difference\nh\n= 1 sub-configuration states refers to the structure and position of\nrelative to the Ns1\nthe remaining three primary links of that s1 bond particle, the link-structure of the\nunoccupied site being the same as that shown in Fig. 9.\nSpecifically, the unoccupied-site link structure of the top configurations on the lefth\nand right-hand side of Fig. 9 are the same as those of the g-primary partitions of Ns1\n=1\nhorizontal-kink and horizontal-anti-kink sub-configuration states, respectively. For the\nd = 2, l = \u00b11 primary partitions and d = 1, l = \u22121 (and d = 1, l = +1) primary\npartition on the left-hand side (and right-hand site) of the figure top the unoccupied\nsite is that attached to a single link, marked by an open circle. In turn, for the d = 1,\nl = +1 (and d = 1, l = \u22121) primary partition the unoccupied site is that attached\nto three links. Moreover, for the d = 1, l = \u00b11 primary partitions and the d = 2,\nl = \u22121 (and d = 2, l = +1) primary partition on the left-hand side (and right-hand\nside) of the figure lower-limit associated with the vertical-kink (and vertical-anti-kink)\nsub-configuration state the unoccupied site is that attached to a single link, marked by\nan open circle. On the other hand, for the corresponding d = 2 and l = +1 (and d = 2,\nl = \u22121) primary partition the unoccupied site is that attached to three links. Such four\ntypes of unoccupied-site link structures correspond to the g-primary partitions of the\nh\nfour Ns1\n= 1 sub-configuration states, respectively.\n\n\fGround-state two-spinon bonds in the Hubbard model on a square lattice\n\n29\n\nThe g-primary partitions of the horizontal-kink and horizontal-anti-kink (and\nvertical-kink and vertical-anti-kink) sub-configuration states include a kink row as that\nrepresented in Fig. 8 and a anti-kink row (and a kink column and anti-kink column),\nrespectively. Such a row (and column) link occupancy configuration involves the set of\nsites belonging to the same row (and column) as the extra site. As mentioned above,\nan alternative designation for the kink row, anti-kink row, kink column, and anti-kink\ncolumn is 1, +1 line, 1, \u22121 line, 2, +1 line, and 2, \u22121 line, respectively. The general d, l\nline occurs in a primary g-basic partition for whose d, l primary partition the unoccupied\nsite is attached to three links.\nThere is an apparent contradiction concerning the following issue. On the one hand,\nthat the extra-site periodic boundary conditions (34) refer to both a row and column\nof Nas + 1 sites is valid for the 2D = 2, 4 sub-configuration states simultaneously.\nOn the other hand, concerning the g-primary partitions of such states, Nas + 1-site\nperiodic boundary conditions apply to either the sites of the spin effective lattice other\nthan the extra site belonging to the extra-site row or extra-site column, respectively.\nSpecifically, for g-primary partitions of horizontal (and vertical) sub-configuration states\nsuch periodic boundary conditions apply to the sites belonging to the 1, l (and 2, l) line\nonly, whereas for the sites belonging to the extra-site column (and row) other than the\nextra site the periodic boundary conditions refer to Nas sites rather than to Nas + 1\nsites.\nThe reason behind that apparent inconsistency is that the link occupancy\nconfigurations of each of the 2D = 2, 4 d, l lines of the 2D = 2, 4 g-primary partitions,\nrespectively, are different and thus refer to different sub-configuration states yet they\nall involve the same extra site. We recall that the extra site of Figs. 7-9 is linked to one\nsite only. For g-primary partitions with a 1, l (and 2, l) line the extra site is linked to a\nsite belonging to that line only so that only the real-space coordinates of the remaining\nsites belonging to the 1, l (and 2, l) line are shifted, whereas those of the sites belonging\nto the extra-site column (and row) remain unaltered.\nIn addition to the d, l line of a g-primary partition, it is useful to consider its two\nnearest neighboring lines. For each such an occupancy configuration there are three\nd, l, l\u2032 lines where l\u2032 = \u22121, 0, +1. Here d, l, 0 \u2261 d, l line is a more general notation for\nthe d, l line. For a kink or anti-kink row the 1, l, l\u2032 line is the row above it for l\u2032 = +1\nand below it for l\u2032 = \u22121. Moreover, for a kink or anti-kink column the 2, l, l\u2032 line is the\ncolumn on its right-hand side for l\u2032 = +1 and on its left-hand side for l\u2032 = \u22121.\n4.2. Motion of the unoccupied site around in the spin effective lattice\nThe motion of the unoccupied site around in the spin effective lattice discussed here can\nbe described as well in terms of the motion of the corresponding unoccupied site of the\ns1 effective lattice around in such a lattice. In the case of the s1 fermion description of\nthe square-lattice model investigated in Ref. [2] the generators of the motion considered\nhere are the two s1 translation generators in the presence of the fictitious magnetic field\n\n\fGround-state two-spinon bonds in the Hubbard model on a square lattice\n\n30\n\n~ s1 associated with the Jordan-Wigner transformation that maps the s1 bond particles\nB\ninto s1 fermions. The components qj x1 and qj x2 of the discrete momentum values q~j\nof the s1 fermions are the eigenvalues of such two s1 translation generators. Since the\ns1 fermion creation and annihilation operators are defined in and act onto subspaces\nspanned by mutually neutral states [2] such operators commute and the two components\nqj x1 and qj x2 can be simultaneously specified.\nIt follows from the above analysis that for the s1 effective lattice and the 2D = 2, 4\ng-primary partitions of all sub-configuration states the unoccupied site has a well-defined\nh\nposition. For Ns1\n= 1 there are Nas1 = Ns1 + 1 configuration states and this is also\nthe number of different positions that the unoccupied site can have in the s1 effective\nlattice.\nTransitions between configuration states where the unoccupied site has different\npositions in the s1 effective lattice result from a set of well-defined elementary steps\nwhich are behind its motion around in the spin and s1 effective lattices. The generators\nof such processes have simple and obvious expressions in terms of s1 bond-particle\ncreation and annihilation operators. The above elementary steps correspond to changes\nin the occupancy configurations of rotated electrons and the unitary operator V\u0302\npreserves the occurrence of nearest hopping only for such objects. Therefore, in the\ncase of the square lattice rotated electrons can hop vertically or horizontally only and\ngiven the relation between the original lattice and the spin effective lattice that leads\nto restrictions in the changes of the position of the link-site attachments. Indeed, the\nelementary steps behind the net motion of the unoccupied site involve horizontal or\nvertical shifts by \u00b1as of some of such attachments where as is the lattice constant of\nthe spin effective lattice given in Eq. (1). The net length passed by the unoccupied site\nin an elementary step is 2as .\nFor 1D the unoccupied site moves by \u00b12as in each elementary step. As for\nthe square-lattice case, such elementary steps involve smaller virtual elementary steps\nwhere link-site attachments move by \u00b1as . For the square lattice the net motion of the\nunoccupied site is given by \u00b12as ~exi where i = 1 and i = 2 for horizontal and vertical\nelementary processes, respectively. In such elementary steps the net length 2as passed\nby the s1 bond particle corresponds to horizontal or vertical motion. In addition, for the\nsquare lattice there are horizontal-vertical or vertical-horizontal elementary steps where\nthe unoccupied site moves by \u00b1as [~exi + ~exi\u2032 ] or \u00b1as [~exi \u2212 ~exi\u2032 ] where i = 1, 2 and i\u2032 6= i.\nFor the latter elementary steps the net length 2as corresponds to both a horizontal and\n\u221a\na vertical \u00b1as shift, so that the initial and final positions distance is 2 as\nFor the g-primary partitions any elementary process involves the virtual\nannihilation of one of the four s1 bond particles surrounding the extra site. That\nvirtual process involves the creation of two unoccupied sites and is followed by suitable\nhorizontal and/or vertical \u00b1as shifts of well-defined link-site attachments. Those shifts\nare equivalent to the unoccupied site moving by \u00b12as ~exi , \u00b1as [~exi +~exi\u2032 ], or \u00b1as [~exi \u2212~exi\u2032 ]\nwhere i = 1, 2 and i\u2032 6= i. Finally, a s1 bond particle is created onto the site of the s1\neffective lattice unoccupied in the initial configuration so that two unoccupied sites of\n\n\fGround-state two-spinon bonds in the Hubbard model on a square lattice\n\n31\n\nthe virtual state are occupied.\nFor some g-primary partitions of the model on the square lattice such elementary\nsteps also involve collective processes where a whole kink row or anti-kink row (and kink\ncolumn or anti-kink column) configuration moves from one row (and column) to the\nnearest-neighboring or second-nearest-neighboring row (and column). Such processes\nconsist of a collective horizontal (and vertical) shift of \u2212as or +as of all the sites of\na kink or anti-kink row (and kink or anti-kink column), respectively, plus a collective\nhorizontal (and vertical) opposite shift of +as or \u2212as of all the sites of a nearestneighboring or second-nearest-neighboring kink or anti-kink row (and kink or anti-kink\ncolumn), respectively.\nSpecifically, for g-primary partitions of horizontal (and vertical) sub-configuration\nstates, unoccupied-site horizontal (and vertical) elementary steps do not involve such\nkink or anti-kink row interchanges (and kink or anti-kink column interchanges).\nIn contrast, for g-primary partitions of vertical (and horizontal) sub-configuration\nstates, unoccupied-site horizontal (and vertical) elementary steps involve kink or antikink column interchanges (and kink or anti-kink row interchanges) of second-nearestneighboring columns (and rows). On the other hand, horizontal-vertical or verticalhorizontal elementary steps involve kink or anti-kink row interchanges of nearestneighboring rows for g-primary partitions of horizontal sub-configuration states and\nkink or anti-kink column interchanges of nearest-neighboring columns for primary gprimary partitions of vertical sub-configuration states.\nAny motion of the unoccupied site around in the spin effective lattice can be\ngenerated by a set of the above elementary steps. The processes behind such steps\nare easiest to describe for the primary partitions. However, they are also well-defined\nfor the remaining partitions.\n4.3. Correspondence between the N1h = 1 and N1h = 0 configuration states\nh\nThe partitions that span the 2D = 2, 4 sub-configuration states of a Ns1\n= 1\nconfiguration state are independent so that the number of partitions of the latter state is\nh\n2D = 2, 4 times larger than that of the Ns1\n= 0 configuration state. Indeed, there is an\nh\none-to-one correspondence between the partitions of that state and those of a Ns1\n=1\nsub-configuration state with the same number of s1 bond particles. Concerning the\nh\nprimary partitions of Ns1\n= 1 sub-configuration states, except for the sites of the spin\neffective lattice belonging to the row and column which the unoccupied site belongs to,\nthe real-space coordinates of the sites of that lattice have the same real-space coordinates\nh\nas those of the corresponding primary partitions of the Ns1\n= 0 configuration state with\nthe same number of s1 bond particles.\nh\nA Ns1\n= 1 configuration state is defined by the position of its extra site whose\nreal-space coordinate in the s1 effective lattice is the same as that of the corresponding\nunoccupied site. Except for the sites belonging to the kink row and anti-kink row (and\nkink column and anti-kink column), respectively, for the horizontal-kink and horizontal-\n\n\f32\n\nGround-state two-spinon bonds in the Hubbard model on a square lattice\n\nanti-kink (and vertical-kink and vertical-anti-kink) sub-configuration state the two sites\nof each of the Ns1 links of the 2D = 2, 4 primary partitions have the same real-space\nh\ncoordinates as the corresponding primary partitions of the Ns1\n= 0 configuration state.\nThe shifts of the real-space coordinates of the sites of the primary partitions of the\nh\nNs1 = 0 configuration state which become sites of a d, l line in the corresponding final\nsub-configuration state lead to the following real-space coordinates for the latter sites,\n0\n~rj0 \u2192 ~rj = ~rj0 + 2~rd,l\n= ~rj0 + l as ~ed .\n\n(36)\n\nh\nHere ~rj0 denotes the corresponding real-space coordinate of the initial Ns1\n= 0\nconfiguration state.\nh\nThe procedure to construct the non-primary partitions of a Ns1\n= 1 subconfiguration state profits from all two-site links remaining exactly the same and only\nh\nthe real-space coordinates of the sites of the spin effective lattice of the Ns1\n= 1 subconfiguration state whose real-space coordinates are shifted for the primary partitions\nas given in Eq. (36) being shifted exactly by the same amount for the corresponding\nnon-primary partitions. Such a procedure applies to any of the Ns1 + 1 positions of\nh\nthe unoccupied site in the s1 effective lattice and hence to all corresponding Ns1\n=1\nconfiguration states. It corresponds to the elementary processes generated by application\nof an one-electron operator onto a x \u2265 0 and m = 0 ground state.\n\n4.4. s1 bond-particle operators of N1h = 1 configuration states\nh\n= 1 configuration state has a\nEach of the 2D = 2, 4 sub-configuration states of a Ns1\nd, l line in the corresponding d, l g-primary partition where for 1D the index d is given\nonly by d = 1.

More about Ns1\n= 0, 1, 2 configuration states\n\nThe s1 fermion momentum occupancies of Ref. [2] of excited states generated by\napplication onto x \u2265 0 and m = 0 ground states of two-electron operators involving\n(i) creation or annihilation of two electrons with the same spin projection and (ii)\nspin-triplet and spin-singlet excitations are described by a superposition of the set of\nh\n[Ns1 + 2] [Ns1 + 1]/2 configuration states with Ns1\n= 2 unoccupied sites studied in the\nh\nfollowing. Indeed, there are [Ns1 + 2] [Ns1 + 1]/2 different Ns1\n= 2 configuration states\ncorresponding to the possible [Ns1 + 2] [Ns1 + 1]/2 positions of the two unoccupied sites\nin the s1 effective lattice. According to Eq. (9), here Ns1 + 2 = [NaDs /2 + Ss ] where\nSs = 1 for Ns2 = 0 and Ss = 0 for Ns2 = 1 is the number of sites NaDs1 of that lattice\nh\nwhose number of unoccupied sites reads Ns1\n= [2Ss + 2Ns2 ] = 2. For such states the\nD\nnumber Nas = [2Ns1 + 4 \u2212 2Ss ] of sites of the spin effective lattice is even. There are two\nh\nsets of [Ns1 + 2] [Ns1 + 1]/2 configuration states which contribute to different Ns1\n=2\nh\nenergy eigenstates. Those are the Ns1 = 2, Ss = 1, Ns2 = 0 spin-triplet configuration\nh\nstates and Ns1\n= 2, Ss = 0, Ns2 = 1 spin-singlet configuration states, respectively.\nSince it is assumed that for the square lattice [2Ns1 ]1/2 is an integer number, the\nnotations Na2s1 and Na2s do not mean that the numbers Nas1 and Nas are integers.\nNa2s1 = Ns1 + 2 and Na2s = [2Ns1 + 4 \u2212 2Ss ] are integer numbers. In turn, the integer\nnumbers closest to Nas1 and Nas are the mean value of the number of sites of each\nrow and column of the s1 and spin effective lattice, respectively. Our study takes into\naccount the exact number of sites of such rows and columns.\n\n\fGround-state two-spinon bonds in the Hubbard model on a square lattice\n\n34\n\nh\nConcerning the above two types of Ns1\n= 2 configuration states, the two unoccupied\nsites can either correspond to two independent +1/2 spinons (Ss = 1 and Ns2 = 0) or two\nspinons out of the four which are part of the s2 fermion (Ss = 0 and Ns2 = 1). We recall\nthat alike an independent spinon, the spin-neutral four-spinon occupancy configuration\nof such a s2 fermion remains invariant under the electron - rotated-electron unitary\ntransformation [2].\nFor the Na2s \u2192 \u221e limit considered here for the model on the square lattice the\ncorrect physics is achieved if one considers that out of the [2Ns1 + 4 \u2212 2Ss ] sites of the\nspin effective lattice, 2Ns1 sites correspond to a square lattice and the position of the\nh\ntwo extra sites which contribute to the s1 effective lattice is defined as for the Ns1\n=1\nconfiguration states. For the model both on the 1D and square lattice and Ss = 0 and\nthus Ns2 = 1 the number of sites of the spin effective lattice is given by NaDs = 2Ns1 + 4.\nHowever, two of the four extra sites do not contribute to the s1 effective lattice. The\nh\npoint is that for Ns1\n= 2 configuration states with Ss = 0 and Ns2 = 1 when the s1 bond\nparticles moves around in that lattice, they use as unoccupied sites only two out of the\nfour sites of the s2 fermion. Two of these four sites of the spin effective lattice do not\nbelong to the s1 effective lattice, alike the sites of the \u03b7-spin effective lattice associated\nwith the original rotated-electron unoccupied sites do not belong to the spin effective\nlattice.\nThe spin SU(2) symmetry imposes that the s1 effective lattices of the N2h = 2\nconfiguration states such that (i) Ss = 1 for Ns2 = 0 and (ii) Ss = 0 for Ns2 = 1,\nrespectively, must be identical. In either case each of the two extra sites obeys the\nboundary conditions given in Eq. (34) which for the present Nas \u2192 \u221e limit yield the\ncorrect physics. For the square lattice the row and column periodic boundary conditions\nh\nare similar to those of the Ns1\n= 1 configuration states. For the 1D lattice periodic\nconditions are also used.\nh\nSymmetry imposes that for g-primary partitions of Ns1\n= 2 configuration states the\ntwo unoccupied sites are associated with kink-like and anti-kink-like link configurations,\nrespectively. Moreover, symmetry implies that only sub-configuration states for whose\ng-primary partitions both the kink and anti-kink link configurations associated with\nthe two unoccupied sites, respectively, correspond to rows or columns are allowed.\nh\nh\nIt follows that alike for Ns1\n= 1 configuration states, a Ns1\n= 2 configuration\nstate involves 2D = 2, 4 sub-configuration states. In the present case there are\ntwo horizontal sub-configuration states for whose g-primary partitions the unoccupied\nsites of real-space coordinates ~rj0 and ~rj0\u2032 are associated with row kink-like and antikink-like link configurations and row anti-kink-like and kink-like link configurations,\nrespectively. Furthermore, there are two vertical sub-configuration states for whose gprimary partitions the unoccupied sites with such real-space coordinates are associated\nwith column kink-like and anti-kink-like link configurations and column anti-kink-like\nand kink-like link configurations, respectively.\nh\nIt is useful to classify the Ns1\n= 2 configuration states into three main classes:\n\n\fGround-state two-spinon bonds in the Hubbard model on a square lattice\n\n35\n\nh\n1) Ns1\n= 2 configuration states whose two extra sites do not belong to the same\nrow and column. Such states occur for the model on the square lattice but do not exist\nfor the 1D lattice. For the corresponding g-primary partitions the occupied sites are the\nextra sites, which correspond to kink-like or anti-kink-like link configurations of the same\nh\nform as those of Ns1\n= 1 states. Indeed, each unoccupied site behaves independently and\ncan move around in the spin effective lattice by means of the elementary steps discussed\nh\nabove for the Ns1\n= 1 configuration states. For all g-primary partitions one unoccupied\nsite is associated with a kink-like link configuration and the other with an anti-kink-like\nlink configuration, respectively. The s1 bond-particle operators are defined as for the\nh\nNs1\n= 1 configuration states by Eqs. (37)-(40) but with parallel d, +1 and d, \u22121 lines\nand the index i corresponding to the four sub-configuration states defined above for the\nh\nNs1\n= 2 configuration states.\nh\n2) Ns1\n= 2 configuration states whose two extra sites belong to the same row or\ncolumn but are not nearest neighboring sites. For the 1D lattice only states of this\ntype and of type 3 exist. Let the two extra sites have real-space coordinates ~rj0 and\n~rj0\u2032 . Then for the g-primary partition of one of the two horizontal (and vertical) subconfiguration states the link occupancy involving sites belonging to the row part (and\ncolumn part) located between the sites of real-space coordinates ~rj0 and ~rj0\u2032 has opposite\nsign relative to those of the surrounding rows (and columns) whereas the link occupancy\ninvolving sites belonging to the row part (and column part) located between the sites\nof real-space coordinates ~rj0\u2032 and ~rj0 has the same sign as those of the surrounding\nrows. In contrast, for the g-primary partition of the other horizontal (and vertical)\nsub-configuration states the sign of the link occupancies on the two above row parts\n(and column parts) is the opposite. For g-primary partitions the two unoccupied sites\nof real-space coordinates ~rj0 and ~rj0\u2032 behave as kink or anti-kink mobile domain walls\nwhose link structure is shown in Figs. 7 and 9. The s1 bond-particle operators are\nh\ndefined as for the Ns1\n= 1 configuration states by Eqs. (37)-(40) but with the operators\nwhose real-space coordinates correspond to link occupancy configurations with opposite\nsign relative to those of the surrounding rows or columns referring to the d, j line parts\ndefined above instead of to the whole d, j line.\nh\n3) Ns1\n= 2 configuration states whose two extra sites belong to the same row\nand column and are nearest-neighboring sites in the spin effective lattice. In that case\nthere is both a horizontal and a vertical sub-configuration state whose extra-site row and\ncolumn link occupancies have opposite sign relative to those of the surrounding rows and\ncolumns, respectively. In turn, for the other horizontal and vertical sub-configuration\nstates, respectively, all link occupancies have the same sign and the two-unoccupied-site\nlink occupancy configuration of the corresponding g-primary partitions are identical. A\nsmall sub-domain of such a link configuration including the two-unoccupied sites of the\nspin effective lattice is shown on the right-hand side of Fig. 4. These configuration states\ncan be generated from those of type 2. This is achieved by moving both unoccupied\nsites through their row or column, one against the other, until they become nearest-\n\n\fGround-state two-spinon bonds in the Hubbard model on a square lattice\n\n36\n\nneighbor sites. For the square (and 1D) lattice, the g-primary partitions of two (and\none) out of the four (and two) sub-configuration states such a motion and resulting\n\"collision\" leads to the full cancellation of the corresponding kink-like and anti-kink-like\nlink occupancy configurations. Such a unoccupied-site kink and anti-kink annihilation\nhas similarities with a particle - anti-particle annihilation process. The corresponding\n\"collisions\" occur more often for a unoccupied site moving around in the spin effective\nlattice of the 1D lattice. Indeed, then there is a single chain. In contrast, for the model\non the square lattice there are both horizontal and vertical elementary steps so that the\ntwo unoccupied sites can move independently around in the spin effective lattice without\ncolliding provided that their motion involves configuration states of type 1, which do\nnot exist in 1D. For the two above sub-configuration states of the model on the square\nlattice whose extra-site row or column link occupancies have opposite sign relative to\nthose of the surrounding rows or columns, respectively, the s1 bond-particle operators\nh\nare defined as for the Ns1\n= 1 configuration states by Eqs. (37)-(40). For the other two\nsub-configuration states whose extra-site row or column link occupancies have the same\nsign as those of the surrounding rows or columns, respectively, the s1 bond-particle\nh\n= 0 configuration states by Eq. (24).\noperators are defined alike for the Ns1\nh\nof unoccupied sites is a good quantum number for the model on the\nThe number Ns1\nsquare lattice in the one- and two-electron subspace so that the s1 fermion momentum\noccupancies of Ref. [2] of the states that span such a subspace are described by a suitable\nsuperposition of configuration states with constant number of unoccupied sites in the\nh\ns1 effective lattice. For instance, the s1 fermion momentum occupancy of a Ns1\n=2\nspin-triplet (and spin-singlet) excited state is described by a suitable superposition of\nh\n= 2 configuration states with Ss = 1 and Ns2 = 0 (and\nthe [Ns1 + 2] [Ns1 + 1]/2 Ns1\nwith Ss = 0 and Ns2 = 1.) Application of a s1 bond-particle creation operator of realspace coordinate ~rj onto such a ground state gives zero for configuration states of the\nabove types 1 and 2: only the two sub-configuration states of a configuration state of\ntype 3 whose link configurations have all the same sign and the real-space coordinate of\nthe central unoccupied site on the right-hand side of Fig. 4 coincides with that of the\nh\napplied operator are transformed onto the Ns1\n= 0 configuration state with one more\ns1 bond particle than the initial state.\nh\nMoreover, application of a s1 bond-particle creation operator onto Ns1\n= 0, 1\nconfiguration states gives always zero. In turn, application of a s1 bond-particle\nannihilation operator whose real-space coordinate is that of an occupied site of the\nh\ns1 effective lattice of a Ns1\n= 0, 1, 2 configuration state transforms it into a state with\ntwo more unoccupied sites than the initial state.\nFinally, in Appendix A it is confirmed that within the description used in the\nstudies of Ref. [2] one has that for U/4t > 0 and the subspaces where the s1 bondh\nparticle operators of the one- and two-electron and Ns1\n= 0, 1, 2 subspace are defined,\nupon acting onto the s1 effective lattice such operators anticommute on the same site\n\n\fGround-state two-spinon bonds in the Hubbard model on a square lattice\n\n37\n\nof that lattice,\n{g~r\u2020j ,s1, g~rj ,s1 } = 1 ; {g~r\u2020j ,s1 , g~r\u2020j ,s1} = {g~rj ,\u03b1\u03bd , g~rj ,s1 } = 0 ,\n\n(41)\n\nand commute on different sites,\n[g~r\u2020j ,s1 , g~rj\u2032 ,s1] = [g~r\u2020j ,s1 , g~r\u2020j\u2032 ,s1] = [g~rj ,s1 , g~rj\u2032 ,1 ] = 0 ,\n\n(42)\n\nwhere j 6= j \u2032 . That algebra confirms that the s1 bond-particle operators are hard-core\nlike.\n5. Concluding remarks\nFor the Hubbard model on the square lattice in the one- and two-electron subspace the\nh\nnumber Ns1\nof unoccupied sites of the s1 effective lattice is a good quantum number.\nh\nSuch a subspace is spanned by the states with Ns1\n= 0, 1, 2, whose spin configurations\nare investigated in this paper. In the studies of Sections 3 and 4 a change of gauge\nstructure [22] is considered so that the real-space coordinates of the sites of the s1\neffective lattice correspond to one of the two sub-lattices of the spin effective lattice.\nh\nThat change is fulfilled for the Ns1\n= 0 configuration state for which the gauge structure\noccurs. That leads to two alternative definitions of the s1 effective lattice for both that\nh\n= 1, 2 configuration states: As discussed in this paper, the\nstate and the related Ns1\nh\noccupancy configurations of the latter states can be generated from those of the Ns1\n=0\nconfiguration state with the same number of s1 bond particles.\nh\nThe Ns1\n= 0 configuration states studied here generate the spin degrees of freedom\nof the x \u2265 0 and m = 0 ground states and their two-electron charge excited states of\nthe Hubbard model on the square lattice in the one- and two-electron subspace. That\nquantum problem refers to the square-lattice quantum liquid of c and s1 fermions of\nRef. [2]. In turn, the spin configurations of the excited states generated from application\nonto these ground states of one-electron operators and two-electron operators other\nh\nh\nthan the charge operator are suitable superpositions of the Ns1\n= 1 and Ns1\n= 0\nh\nh\nor Ns1 = 2 configuration states, respectively, studied in this paper. For the Ns1 = 1, 2\nstates the unoccupied sites move around in the spin effective lattice through well-defined\nh\n= 2 configuration states the two unoccupied sites may move\nelementary steps. For Ns1\nthrough the same row or column, one against the other, until they become nearestneighbor sites. For the model on the square (and 1D) lattice, for two out of four (and\none out of two) g-primary partitions defined in this paper such a motion and resulting\n\"collision\" leads to the full cancellation of the corresponding kink-like and anti-kinklike link occupancy configurations, similarly to a particle - anti-particle annihilation\nprocess. Such collisions occur more often for an unoccupied site moving around in the\nspin effective lattice of the model on the 1D lattice, which corresponds to a single chain.\nAs confirmed in Appendix A, the spin configurations obtained from such a cancellation\nplay an important role in the s1 bond-particle operator algebra.\nMoreover, in this paper suitable s1 bond-particle operators have been constructed,\nwhich upon acting onto the s1 effective lattice obey a hard-core like algebra. Such a\n\n\fGround-state two-spinon bonds in the Hubbard model on a square lattice\n\n38\n\nproperty is valid for the subspaces in which the s1 bond-particle operators act onto. It\nplays an important role in the related studies of Ref. [2]. There corresponding s1 fermion\noperators are generated by means of an extended Jordan-Wigner transformation from\nthe s1 bond-particle operators introduced in this paper. Concerning previous studies on\nthe large-U Hubbard model and t \u2212 J model on a square lattice involving for instance\nthe slave particle formalism [16, 18, 22] or Jordan-Wigner transformations [12], the\ncrucial requirement is to impose the single occupancy constraint. Here that constraint\nis naturally implemented for all values of U/4t > 0, since the spins associated with the\nspin SU(2) state representations refer to the rotated electrons of the singly occupied\nsites. Moreover, for the above schemes the spinless fermions arise from individual spin1/2 spins or spinons. In contrast, within the extended Jordan-Wigner transformation\nperformed in Ref. [2] the s1 fermions emerge from the spin-neutral two-spinon composite\ns1 bond particles studied in this paper.\nThe studies of Ref. [2] confirm that the results obtained here concerning the\nHubbard model on the square lattice in the one- and two-electron subspace are useful for\nthe further understanding of the role of electronic correlations in the spin-wave spectrum\nobserved in the parent compound La2 CuO4 [1]. A system of weakly coupled planes, each\ndescribed by the square-lattice quantum liquid of Ref. [2], perturbed by the effects of\nintrinsic disorder is expected to be the simplest realistic toy model for the description of\nthe role of correlations effects in the unusual properties of the cuprate hight-temperature\nsuperconductors [14, 15, 16, 17].\nI thank Nuno M.

Hard-core character of the s1 bond-particle operators\nThe goal of this Appendix is to confirm the validity of the relations provided in Eqs. (41)\nand (42). In order to probe such relations, we consider without any loss of generality that\nh\nthe initial state is a Ns1\n= 4 configuration state. Indeed and as discussed in Subsection\nh\n4-5, application of a s1 bond-particle creation operator onto Ns1\n= 0, 1 configuration\nh\nstates gives zero. Application of two s1 bond-particle creation operators onto Ns1\n=2\nh\nconfiguration states gives zero as well. The studies on Ns1 = 2 configuration states of\nh\nthat subsection can be straightforwardly generalized to Ns1\n= 4 configuration states.\nThat assures that application onto those of four-site two-bond operator may not give\nzero. Fortunately, the final results reached here apply to any configuration state with a\nh\nfinite number Ns1\nof unoccupied sites in the s1 effective lattice, yet are simpler to derive\nh\nfor the Ns1 = 4 configuration states.\nh\nSub-configuration states of type 3 considered in Subsection 4-5 for Ns1\n= 2 also\nh\nh\nexist for Ns1 = 4. Within those with Ns1 = 4 unoccupied sites, the importance of\nsub-configuration states whose link configurations have all the same sign stems from\n\n\fGround-state two-spinon bonds in the Hubbard model on a square lattice\n\n39\n\nthose being the only ones for which application of s1 bond-particle creation operators\nh\ndoes not give zero. For other Ns1\n-finite sub-configuration states the s1 bond-particle\noperators have slightly more involved expressions given in Section 4. Fortunately, the\nuse of the operator expressions suitable for sub-configuration states of type 3 leads to the\nsame final results. Therefore, for simplicity we consider here the latter s1 bond-particle\nh\noperators whose expressions are the same as for the Ns1\n= 0 configuration state studied\nin Section 3.\nAll the results of this Appendix apply to the model on both the square and\n1D lattices. The 1D expressions are readily obtained if one considers in the general\nexpressions given below only d = 1 contributions and terms, together with the choice\nD = 1 in the D-dependent quantities. In order to reach our goal, let us recall that the\nrotated-electron operators are related to the original electron operators as follows,\nc\u0303~\u2020rj ,\u03c3 = V\u0302 \u2020 c~r\u2020j ,\u03c3 V\u0302 ,\n\n(A.1)\n\nwhere V\u0302 is the electron - rotated-electron unitary operator.\nStraightforward\nmanipulations based on Eqs. (5)-(7) then lead to the following algebra for the related c\nfermion operators [2],\n{f~rj ,c , f~r\u2020j\u2032 ,c } = \u03b4j,j \u2032 ;\n\n{f~r\u2020j ,c , f~r\u2020j\u2032 ,c } = {f~rj ,c , f~rj\u2032 ,c } = 0 ,\n\n(A.2)\n\nc fermion operators and rotated-quasi-spin operators,\n[f~r\u2020j ,c , q~rl j\u2032 ] = [f~rj ,c , q~rl j\u2032 ] = 0 ,\n\n(A.3)\n\nand rotated-quasi-spin operators,\nX\n\u2032\u2032\nx \u2032\nx\n\u01ebpp\u2032 p\u2032\u2032 q~rpj ; p = 1, 2, 3 ,\n[q~rjp , q~rjp\u2032 ] = i \u03b4j,j \u2032\n\n(A.4)\n\np\u2032\u2032\n\n{q~r+j , q~r\u2212j } = 1 ,\n\n{q~r\u00b1j , q~r\u00b1j } = 0 ,\n\n[q~r+j , q~r\u2212j\u2032 ] = \u03b4j,j \u2032 2q~rxj3 ,\n\n[q~r\u00b1j , q~r\u00b1j\u2032 ] = 0 .\n\n(A.5)\n(A.6)\n\nHence the rotated-quasi-spin operators q~r\u00b1j anticommute on the same site and commute\non different sites.\nMoreover, combining the expressions given in Eq. (6) with the algebraic relations\nprovided in Eqs. (A.4)-(A.6) one readily finds that,\n{s~r+j , s~\u2212\nrj } = 1 ,\n\n{s~r\u00b1j , s~r\u00b1j } = 0 ,\n\n\u2212\n\u00b1\n\u00b1\n[s~+\nrj , s~\nrj \u2032 ] = [s~\nrj , s~\nrj \u2032 ] = 0 ,\n\n(A.7)\n(A.8)\n\nfor j 6= j \u2032 and,\n\n[s~zrj , s~r\u00b1j\u2032 ] = \u00b1\u03b4j,j \u2032 s~\u00b1\nrj .\n\n(A.9)\n\nIt follows that the spinon operators s~r\u00b1j anticommute on the same site and commute\non different sites. Consistently with the rotated-electron singly-occupied site projector\nn~rj ,c appearing in the expression of the spinon operators s~r\u00b1j and s~rzj provided in Eq.\n(6), their real-space coordinates ~rj can in the present NaD \u2192 \u221e limit be identified with\n\n\f40\n\nGround-state two-spinon bonds in the Hubbard model on a square lattice\n\nthose of the spin effective lattice. Therefore, the corresponding operator index values\nj = 1, ..., Nas are chosen to be those of that lattice.\nFor the sub-configuration states of type 3 the operators g~r\u2020j ,s1 (and g~rj ,s1 ) which\ncreate (and annihilate) a s1 bond particle at a site of the spin effective lattice of realspace coordinate ~rj have the general form given in Eq. (24) both for the model on the\n1D and square lattices, where the absolute value |hg | of the coefficients hg decreases\nfor increasing link length \u03beg and obeys the normalization sum-rule (25). Hence the\nexpression of the s1 bond-particle operator g~r\u2020j ,s1 involves the operators a~r\u2020j ,s1,g and a~rj ,s1,g\nof Eq. (24), which create and annihilate, respectively, a superposition of 2D = 2, 4 twosite bonds of the same type and b~r\u2020,s1,d,l,g and b~r,s1,d,l,g are two-site one-bond operators\nwhose expression is given in Eq. (27).\nIn order to confirm the validity of Eqs. (41) and (42) let us use Eqs. (24)-(27)\nto rewrite the anti-commutation relations of Eq. (41) in terms of anti-commutators of\ntwo-site one-bond operators as follows,\nX X\n{g~r\u2020j ,s1, g~rj ,s1 } =\nh\u2217g hg\u2032 {b~r\u2020j +~r 0 ,s1,d,l,g , b~rj +~r 0\u2032 \u2032 ,s1,d\u2032 ,l\u2032 ,g\u2032 } ,\n(A.10)\nd ,l\n\nd,l\n\nd,l,g d\u2032 ,l\u2032 ,g \u2032\n\n{g~r\u2020j ,s1, g~r\u2020j ,s1 } =\n\nX X\n\nh\u2217g h\u2217g\u2032 {b~r\u2020j +~r 0\n\n{g~rj ,s1, g~rj ,s1 } =\n\nX X\n\n0 ,s1,d,l,g , b~\nhg hg\u2032 {b~rj +~rd,l\nrj +~\nr 0\u2032\n\nd,l,g d\u2032 ,l\u2032 ,g \u2032\n\nd,l,g\n\nd,l ,s1,d,l,g\n\n, b~r\u2020j +~r 0\n\nd\u2032 ,l\u2032\n\nd ,l\u2032\n\nd\u2032 ,l\u2032 ,g \u2032\n\n},\n\n(A.11)\n\n,s1,d\u2032 ,l\u2032 ,g \u2032 } ,\n\n(A.12)\n\n,s1,d\u2032 ,l\u2032 ,g \u2032\n\nwhere for simplicity we used the abbreviated summation notation,\nX\nd,l,g\n\n\u2261\n\n/2D\u22121\nD X Ns1X\nX\nd=1 l=\u00b11\n\n.\n\n(A.13)\n\ng=0\n\nMoreover, by the use of the same equations the commutation relations of Eq.

(A.10)-(A.12) and (A.14)-(A.16), respectively, relies on both such\nz\nrules and the algebra given in Eqs. (A.7)-(A.9) of the spinon operators s~\u00b1\nrj of\nrj and s~\nEq.

Indeed, according to the second rule\nfor the subspace where the two-site one-bond operators act onto only general operators\nb~\u2020r1 ,~r2 b~r1\u2032 ,~r2\u2032 which do not join sites or join both sites of the spin effective lattice lead to\nwanted and physical spin configurations.\nMoreover, in the initial configuration that the four-site two-bond operators of the\nrelation (A.19) act onto one has according to the first and third rules that the two sites\nof real-space coordinates ~r1 and ~r2 either (i) are occupied by two independent +1/2\nspinons or (ii) are linked by a bond. In turn, the anti-commutator of Eq. (A.20) is of\nthe form of those on the right-hand side of Eq. (A.10) so that in Eq.

(A.23), concerning the latter\noperator when the sites of real-space coordinates ~r1 and ~r2 (and ~r1\u2032 and ~r2\u2032 ) are linked\nby a bond one must consider both initial configurations where the sites of real-space\n\n\fGround-state two-spinon bonds in the Hubbard model on a square lattice\n\n43\n\ncoordinates ~r1\u2032 and ~r2\u2032 (and ~r1 and ~r2 ) are (i) linked by a bond and (ii) occupied by two\nindependent +1/2 spinons. In turn, when the two sites of real-space coordinates ~r1 and\n~r2 (and ~r1\u2032 and ~r2\u2032 ) are occupied by two independent +1/2 spinons one must consider\nonly initial configurations where the sites of real-space coordinates ~r1\u2032 and ~r2\u2032 (and ~r1\nand ~r2 ) are linked by a bond [2]. It follows then from analysis of the operator on the\nright-hand side of Eq. (A.23) that application of it onto any of such spin configurations\ngives zero.\nA similar analysis for the two general anti-commutators needed to evaluate the\ntwo-site one-bond operators on the right-hand side of Eq.

(A.24) reveals that\naccording to the first and third rules when in the initial spin configuration the sites of\nreal-space coordinates ~r1 and ~r2 are both (i) occupied by independent +1/2 spinons and\n(ii) linked by a bond, application of that operator onto such a configuration gives zero.\nOn the other hand, the anti-commutator of Eq. (A.25) is of the form of those on the\n\u2032\ng\nright-hand side of Eq. (A.11) so that in Eq. (A.18) one has that j = j \u2032 yet ~rd,l\n6= ~rdg\u2032 ,l\u2032\nand then the forth rule applies. Since we find that b~r1 ,~r2 b~r1\u2032 ,~r2\u2032 = b~r1\u2032 ,~r2\u2032 b~r1 ,~r2 and each of\nsuch operators is given by one half the operator on the right-hand side of Eq. (A.23),\nconcerning the latter operator when the sites of real-space coordinates ~r1 and ~r2 (and ~r1\u2032\nand ~r2\u2032 ) are occupied by two independent +1/2 spinons one must consider both initial\nconfigurations where the sites of real-space coordinates ~r1\u2032 and ~r2\u2032 (and ~r1 and ~r2 ) are\n(i) linked by a bond and (ii) occupied by two independent +1/2 spinons. In turn, when\nthe two sites of real-space coordinates ~r1 and ~r2 (and ~r1\u2032 and ~r2\u2032 ) are linked by a bond\none must consider only initial configurations where the sites of real-space coordinates\n~r1\u2032 and ~r2\u2032 (and ~r1 and ~r2 ) are occupied by two independent +1/2 spinons [2]. Analysis\nof the operator on the right-hand side of Eq. (A.23) then reveals that application of it\nonto any of such spin configurations gives zero.\nIt then follows from the above results that when acting onto the subspace that the\noperators of Eqs. (24)-(27) refer to the anti-commutators provided in Eqs. (A.22) and\n(A.23) and Eqs. (A.24) and (A.25) simplify and read,\n{b~r\u20201 ,~r2 , b~\u2020r1 ,~r2 } = {b~\u2020r1 ,~r2 , b~\u2020r1\u2032 ,~r2\u2032 } = 0 ;\nwhere ~r1 6= ~r1\u2032 , ~r2\u2032 and ~r2 6= ~r1\u2032 , ~r2\u2032 .\n\n{b~r1 ,~r2 , b~r1 ,~r2 } = {b~r1 ,~r2 , b~r1\u2032 ,~r2\u2032 } = 0 , (A.26)\n\n\fGround-state two-spinon bonds in the Hubbard model on a square lattice\n\n44\n\nThe use in Eq. (A.10) of the anti-commutators of Eq. (A.21) with the two-site\none-bond operators related to those of Eq. (27) by the expressions provided in Eqs.\n(A.17) and (A.18) leads to,\nX\nX\n{g~r\u2020j ,s1, g~rj ,s1 } =\n|hg |2 = 2D\n|hg |2 = 1 ,\n(A.27)\nd,l,g\n\ng\n\nwhich is the first relation of Eq. (41). To perform the summation of Eq. (A.27) the\nsum-rule (25) was used. Furthermore, the use of the anti-commutators of Eq. (A.26) in\nEqs. (A.11) and (A.12) leads to the remaining relations of Eq. (41).\nThe evaluation of the commutators of Eq. (42) by the use of the expressions given\nin Eqs. (A.14)-(A.16) is much simpler. First it is simplified by the property that twosite one-link bonds belonging to s1 bond-particle operators with different real-space\ncoordinates are always different. Second the evaluation of such commutators also relies\non straightforward manipulations based on Eqs. (A.7)-(A.9), which lead directly to,\n[b~\u2020r1 ,~r2 , b~r1\u2032 ,~r2\u2032 ] = [b~\u2020r1 ,~r2 , b~r\u20201\u2032 ,~r2\u2032 ] = [b~r1 ,~r2 , b~r1\u2032 ,~r2\u2032 ] = 0 ,\n\n(A.28)\n\nfor ~r1 6= ~r1\u2032 , ~r2\u2032 and ~r2 6= ~r1\u2032 , ~r2\u2032 .\nFinally, the use in the expressions of the s1 bond-particle operators of Eq. (42) of\nthe commutators of Eq. (A.28) with the two-site one-bond operators related to those of\nEq. (27) by the expressions provided in Eqs. (A.17) and (A.18) in Eqs. (A.14)-(A.16)\nleads readily to the commutation relations provided in Eq. (42).\n[1] Coldea R, Hayden SM, Aeppli G, Perring TG, Frost CD, Mason TE, Cheong S-W and Fisk TZ\n2001 Phys. Rev.
