We distinguish between a rational or irrational\nratio of the moduli of the eigenvalues at the saddle for a certain value of\nthe parameter.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nWe consider analytic diffeomorphisms or vector fields depending on a parameter\n\u03bb and having a hyperbolic stationary point, say the origin 0, of saddle type. For\nsinks or sources we only have finitely many resonances and this is a stable\nphenomenon when varying the parameter \u03bb; the system can be analytically\nreduced to a polynomial, and this reduction depends analytically on \u03bb if the\ndiffeomorphism or vector field does [3, 5]. This holds in any dimension.\nThe question of analytic reduction, for planar one-forms of saddle type, was\nstudied in H. Dulac's memoir [4]. The system is analytically equivalent to a\nnormal form up to a remainder of some finite order of flatness. This form\ndepends on the ratio of the eigenvalues at 0. If this ratio is rational, say \u2212q/p,\none considers the resonant monomial u = xp1 xq2 . The normal form is a function\nof u. The further elimination of the (finitely) flat remainder is of a different\nnature; it can, in general, only be done in a finitely smooth way [6], especially\nin the presence of parameters, which we shall allow in this paper. If one tries\nreduction by means of a formal power series, then this will generically diverge;\nquoting C. Rousseau: 'It is very exceptional that the change of coordinates to\nnormal form converges'. For a geometric explanation of this phenomenon see\n[9]. On the other hand it can be done Gevrey-one [1]. So in both cases we loose\nthe information about the analiticity.\n\n1\n\n\fWe summarise that eliminating the flat remainder can remove some essential\ninformation. In this paper we give a more explicit structure for that analytic\nflat remainder.\nWhen there is no rational relation between the eigenvalues there are conditions allowing to linearize the system [10], but in case that there are parameters,\ni.e. when the eigenvalues vary, these conditions can be destroyed, so also here\na flat remainder R must be allowed for analytic reduction of families.\nIn this paper we study planar analytic systems locally near the origin and\ncan consider them to be sums of convergent power series on some polydisk.\nAlthough, since it is more convenient, we work in the complex, all the results\nremain valid if we work over R, by complexifying the system. The property\n'complexified system coming from a real system' is preserved at each step of\nthe reduction below. The coefficients of the power series are functions of the\nparameter \u03bb. Throughout this note they will all be defined on some sufficiently\nsmall neighbourhood \u039b of a given value \u03bb0 . In fact one considers these functions\nin a space endowed with some supremum norm. One can for example think of\nthe space of functions that are analytic inside a polydisk and continuous on the\nboundary.\nIn the sequel we will use the multi-index conventions i.e. for k = (k1 , k2 ) \u2208\nN2 and x = (x1 , x2 ) \u2208 Cn we write xk = xk11 xk22 and |k| = k1 + k2 .\nWe consider planar local analytic diffeomorphisms near 0 \u2208 C2 fixing 0.\nSince we will be interested in hyperbolic saddles we assume that the linear part\nat 0 has eigenvalues \u03bc1 , \u03bc2 with \u03bc1 6= \u03bc2 . More explicitly let D \u2282 C2 be a\npolydisk at 0 and let\nf\u03bb (x1 , x2 ) = (\u03bc1 (\u03bb)x1 , \u03bc2 (\u03bb)x2 ) +\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nak (\u03bb)xk\n\n(1)\n\n|k|=2\n\nbe absolutely convergent on D where ak (\u03bb) \u2208 C2 .\nFor a certain value \u03bb = \u03bb0 of the parameter we shall distinguish between the\ncases that log |\u03bc1 (\u03bb0 )|/ log |\u03bc2 (\u03bb0 )| is rational or not. Note that this ratio can be\nrational, say \u2212q/p, even if the eigenvalues \u03bc1 (\u03bb0 ) and \u03bc2 (\u03bb0 ) are nonresonant; in\nthe real case this is equivalent with the resonance (in the usual sense) \u03bc1 (\u03bb0 )2p =\n\u03bc2 (\u03bb0 )\u22122q . It is standard to eliminate a finite number of nonresonant monomials\nby a polynomial change of variables [6]. For the theorems 2.1 and 3.1 below we\nhowever we must consider the relation between the moduli of the eigenvalues.\n\n2\n\nq : \u2212p resonance in modulus\n\nWe say that f\u03bb in (1) has a q : \u2212p resonance in modulus at \u03bb = \u03bb0 if |\u03bc1 (\u03bb0 )|p =\n|\u03bc2 (\u03bb0 )|\u2212q , where p and q are positive integers that are relatively prime. It is\nknown from Euclid's division algorithm and from number theory [8] that the\ninteger equation qr \u2212 ps = 1 has one solution (r, s) = (r0 , s0 ) with 0 \u2264 r0 \u2264 p\nand 0 \u2264 s0 \u2264 q. We define \u03b10 = (r0 , s0 ) and \u03b11 = \u2212(r0 , s0 ) + (p, q) =: (r1 , s1 ).\nObserve that qr1 \u2212 ps1 = \u22121 and that also 0 \u2264 r1 \u2264 p and 0 \u2264 s1 \u2264 q.\n2\n\n\fTheorem 2.1 Let f\u03bb be as in (1) and have a hyperbolic fixed point at 0 with\na q : \u2212p resonance in modulus at \u03bb = \u03bb0 . Let N \u2208 N be given. Then there\nis an analytic change of variables h\u03bb near 0 such that g\u03bb = h\u22121\n\u03bb f\u03bb h\u03bb takes the\nfollowing form, where u = xp1 xq2 :\ng\u03bb (x1 , x2 )\n\n=\n\nx1 [\u03bc1 (\u03bb) + b01 (u, \u03bb) + u\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nk=1\n\nx2 [\u03bc2 (\u03bb) +\n\nb02 (u, \u03bb)\n\n+u\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nu\n\n\u0001\nk\u03b11 1k\nb1 (u, \u03bb) ],\nuN k xk\u03b10 b0k\n1 (u, \u03bb) + x\n\nNk\n\nxk\u03b10 b0k\n2 (u, \u03bb)\n\n+\n\n!\n\u0001\n] .(2)\n\nxk\u03b11 b1k\n2 (u, \u03bb)\n\nk=1\n\nwhere moreover:\n1k\n(i) the functions b0i , b0k\ni , bi are locally analytic in u, i = 1, 2;\n(ii) all the occurring power series expressed in the variables x1 , x2 converge on\nsome polydisk at 0;\n(iii) if the family f\u03bb depends analytically on \u03bb near \u03bb0 then this is also the case\n1k\nfor h\u03bb , g\u03bb , b0i , b0k\ni and bi .\nExample 1 For p = 3 and q = 2 we take \u03b10 = (2, 1) and \u03b11 = (1, 1).\nSketch of the proof . We consider the case |\u03bc1 (\u03bb0 )| < 1, the other case\nbeing similar. We denote G0 = {(k1 (r0 , s0 ) + k2 (p, q)|k1 \u2265 1 and \u2212\u221e < k2 \u2264\n(N +1)k1 }\u2229N2 and B0 = N2 \\G0 . Let us define D0 = |\u03bc1 (\u03bb0 )|1/(q(r0 +s0 +N (p+q))\nthen D0 < 1. For an element m = (m1 , m2 ) = k1 (r0 , s0 ) + k2 (p, q) of G0 we\nhave (skipping some straightforward calculations):\n|(\u03bc1 (\u03bb0 ), \u03bc2 (\u03bb0 ))m | =\n\np\n\n|\u03bc1 (\u03bb0 )|r0 k1 \u2212 q s0 k1\n\n(r0 +s0 +(N +1)(p+q))k1\n\n=\n\nD0\n\n\u2264\n\nD0\n\n|m|\n\n(3)\n\nBecause of (3) we can apply the results in [2] and infer that there exists a local\nanalytic change of variables, which we shall denote by h\u0303\u03bb , with h\u0303\u03bb (0) = 0 and\ntangent to the identity such that h\u0303\u22121\n\u03bb f\u03bb h\u0303\u03bb =: g\u0303\u03bb takes the form\n\u221e\nX\n\ng\u0303\u03bb (x1 , x2 ) = (x1 (\u03bc1 (\u03bb)+\n\nam1 (\u03bb)xm ), x2 (\u03bc2 (\u03bb)+\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nam2 (\u03bb)xm )\n\n|m|=2,m\u2208B0\n\n|m|=2,m\u2208B0\n\n(4)\nwhere h\u0303\u03bb , g\u0303\u03bb depend analytically on \u03bb if the family f\u03bb does so. All the involved\npower series converge absolutely on some polydisk at the origin. We can write\nB0 = B1 \u222a B2 where B2 = {k1 (r0 , s0 ) + k2 (p, q)|k1 \u2264 0 and k2 \u2208 Z} \u2229 N2 and\nB1 = {k1 (r0 , s0 ) + k2 (p, q)|k1 \u2265 1 and k2 \u2265 (N + 1)k1 + 1}. If m \u2208 B1 then\nm = k1 (r0 , s0 ) + k2 (p, q) where k2 = (N + 1)k1 + 1 + k\u03032 for some k\u03032 \u2265 0. Hence,\nfor such an m:\nxm\n\n= xk1 \u03b10 u.u(N +1)k1 uk\u03032 .\n3\n\n(5)\n\n\fObserve\nthat monomials in (5) are of the type of the first term of the summation\nP\u221e\nin\n(2).\nk=1\nThe next step consists in considering the inverse g\u0303k\u22121 . Remark that B0 is a\nsubset of\nm2\ns0 + (N + 1)q\nB\u0303 = {(m1 , m2 ) \u2208 N2 |\n\u2265\n}.\n(6)\nm1\nr0 + (N + 1)p\nFurthermore if m = (m1 , m2 ) = k1 (r0 , s0 ) + k2 (p, q) with k2 \u2264 N k1 then\nm2\ns0 + (N + 1)q\n<\n.\nm1\nr0 + (N + 1)p\n\n(7)\n\nHence for such an m we have m \u2208 G\u0303 := N2 \\ B\u0303. So since B0 \u2282 B\u0303 we have on\nthe formal level for the inverse g\u03bb\u22121 the following expansion (see [2]):\n\u221e\nX\n\ng\u0303\u03bb\u22121 (x1 , x2 ) = (x1 (\u03bc1 (\u03bb)\u22121 +\n\n\u00e21,m (\u03bb)xm ), x2 (\u03bc2 (\u03bb)\u22121 +\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n\u00e22,m (\u03bb)xm ))\n\n|m|=2,m\u2208B\u0303\n\n|m|=2,m\u2208B\u0303\n\n(8)\nNow we can reverse the role of x1 and x2 and observe that |\u03bc2 (\u03bb0 )\u22121 | < 1. Let\nus denote G1 = {k1 (r1 , s1 ) + k2 (p, q)|k1 \u2265 1 and \u2212\u221e < k2 \u2264 (N + 1)k1 } and\nwe put D1 = |\u03bc2 (\u03bb0 )|\u22121/(p(r1 +s1 +(N +1)(p+q)) ; observe that D1 < 1. In a similar\n|m|\nway as above we estimate that |(\u03bc1 (\u03bb0 )\u22121 , \u03bc2 (\u03bb0 )\u22121 )m | \u2264 D1 for m \u2208 G1 .\nHence, using once again [2], there exists a local analytic change of variables \u0125\u03bb ,\n\u22121\nwith \u0125\u03bb (0) = 0 and tangent to the identity, such that \u0125\u22121\n\u03bb g\u0303\u03bb \u0125\u03bb = \u011d\u03bb takes the\nform\n\u221e\n\u221e\nX\nX\n\u011d\u03bb (x1 , x2 ) = (x1 (\u03bc1 (\u03bb)\u22121 +\nb\u03021,m (\u03bb)xm ), x2 (\u03bc2 (\u03bb)\u22121 +\nb\u03022,m (\u03bb)xm ))\n|m|=2,m\u2208B\u0302\n\n|m|=2,m\u2208B\u0302\n\n(9)\n\nwhere\nB\u0302 := {(m1 , m2 ) \u2208 N2 |\n\ns1 + (N + 1)q\nm2\ns0 + (N + 1)q\n\u2264\n\u2264\n}.\nr0 + (N + 1)p\nm1\nr1 + (N + 1)p\n\n(10)\n\nMoreover also \u011d\u03bb\u22121 takes the form\n\u011d\u03bb\u22121 (x1 , x2 ) = (x1 (\u03bc1 (\u03bb)\u22121 +\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nb1,m (\u03bb)xm ), x2 (\u03bc2 (\u03bb)\u22121 +\n\n|m|=2,m\u2208B\u0302\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nb2,m (\u03bb)xm )).\n\n|m|=2,m\u2208B\u0302\n\n(11)\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u0125\n=\n\u011d\n,\nwhich\nmeans\nthat\nf\nis\nconjugate\nto\n\u011d\nh\u0303\nObviously, \u0125\u03bb\u22121 h\u0303\u22121\nf\n\u03bb\n\u03bb \u03bb \u03bb\n\u03bb\n\u03bb by\n\u03bb\n\u22121\nh\u0303\u03bb \u25e6 \u0125\u03bb .

If R is irrational we consider the continued fraction expansion\nR = [a1 a2 . . . an . . .]\n\n(13)\n\nof R (see for instance [7], also for the statements (15) and (16) made below).\nLet\nqn\n= [a1 a2 . . . an ]\n(14)\npn\ndenote the convergents of R. One has:\nq1\nq3\nq2k+1\nq2k+2\nq2\n<\n< ... <\n< ... < R < ... <\n< ... < .\n(15)\np1\np3\np2k+1\np2k+2\np2\nThe sequences (pn )n\u2208N and (qn )n\u2208N tend to infinity at least as fast as the\nFibonacci numbers. Our intention is to take pn and qn 'as large as desired'. We\nwill crucially make use of the known fact that\nqn pn+1 \u2212 qn+1 pn = (\u22121)n+1 .\n\n(16)\n\nTheorem 3.1 Let f\u03bb and R be as in (1) respectively (12), and suppose that\n0 is a hyperbolic fixed point of f\u03bb . Let k \u2208 N be given and denote q = q2k+1\nand p = p2k+1 , using the notation from (13) and (14). Denote q\u0303 = q2k+2 and\np\u0303 = p2k+2 . Then there is an analytic change of variables h\u03bb near 0 such that\np q\np\u0303 q\u0303\ng\u03bb = h\u22121\n\u03bb f\u03bb h\u03bb takes the following form, where u = x1 x2 and \u0169 = x1 x2 :\ng\u03bb (x1 , x2 )\n\n= (x1 [\u03bc1 (\u03bb) + ub11 (u, \u0169, \u03bb) + \u0169b21 (u, \u0169, \u03bb)],\nx2 [\u03bc2 (\u03bb) + ub12 (u, \u0169, \u03bb) + \u0169b22 (u, \u0169, \u03bb)])\n\n(17)\n\nwhere moreover:\n(i) the functions bij are locally analytic near (u, \u0169) = (0, 0), i, j = 1, 2;\n(ii) if the family f\u03bb depends analytically on \u03bb near \u03bb0 then this is also the case\nfor h\u03bb , g\u03bb , bij , i, j = 1, 2.\nThe proof of this theorem follows similar lines as in section 2; here we take\nD0 = |\u03bc1 (\u03bb0 )|(Rp\u2212q)/(R(p+q)) and D1 = |\u03bc2 (\u03bb0 )\u22121 |(q\u0303\u2212Rp\u0303)/(p\u0303+q\u0303) .\n\u221a\nExample 2 Let R = \u03c6 = (1 + 5)/2 be the golden ratio and (Fn )n\u2208N the\nF\n\nF\n\nF\n\n2k+1\n2k\nFibonacci sequence. Then we take u = x1 2k+1 x2 2k+2 and \u0169 = uxF\nin\n1 x2\nexpression (17).\n\n4\n\nFinal remarks\n\nRemark 1 In theorems 2.1 and 3.1 we have that the axes {x1 = 0} and {x2 = 0}\nare invariant for g\u03bb . This implies the classical fact that a hyperbolic analytic\n(family-) germ has analytic stable and unstable manifolds. Moreover, from formulas (2) and (17) we see that the flat remainder of these normal forms g\u03bb is\nas (finitely) flat as desired along both {x1 = 0} and {x2 = 0}. In fact this holds\nin any dimension.\nRemark 2 Using the results in [1] we can formulate analogous theorems for\nsaddle singularities of planar vector fields.\n5\n\n\fReferences\n[1] P.
