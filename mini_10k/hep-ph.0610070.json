The strength of CP T -violating dimension five\noperators capable of producing the observed value of baryon abundance is directly related\nto neutrino masses and found to be in the trans-Planckian range (10\u221224 \u2212 10\u221222 ) GeV\u22121 .\nConfronting it with observational tests of Lorentz symmetry, we find that this range of\nLorentz/CP T violation is strongly disfavored by the combination of the low-energy constraints and astrophysical data.\n\nOctober 2006\n\n\f2\nI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nSince the seminal paper by Sakharov [1], it is well known that the baryon asymmetry of the\nUniverse (BAU) can be generated dynamically, through the combination of baryon number\nviolating processes, C and CP violation, and the departure from thermal equilibrium. It\nturns out that the Standard Model (SM) has all necessary ingredients for this to happen.\nNotably, the B + L number is violated by the high-temperature sphaleron processes [2],[3].\nHowever, the existing amount of CP -violation combined with tight constraints on the Higgs\nsector, prevent efficient baryogenesis in the SM. Thus, BAU presents a formidable hint on\nphysics beyond SM, and motivates new experimental searches for the extended electroweak\nsector and new sources of CP violation.\nIt is also known for some time that CP T -odd perturbations can effectively replace two\nSakharov's conditions for baryogenesis: violation of CP invariance and the deviation from\nthermal equilibrium [4]. Indeed, a CP T -odd shift in the \"mass\" of a SM fermion (e.g.\ntop quark [5]), \u2206mCP T would serve as an effective chemical shift between baryons and\nantibaryons above the scale of the electroweak phase transition. It is easy to see that\n\u2206mCP T /mt \u223c O(10\u22126) effect for top quark would be required to generate the observed\nasymmetry [5]. Unfortunately, at the level of the Lagrangian is impossible to define a\nconsistent \"CP T -odd mass\" without breaking the Lorentz invariance. CP T -odd mass would\nhave to be identified with dimension three Lorentz-noninvariant operators [6]. Given the\nstrength of constraints on lower-dimensional CP T /Lorentz noninvariant operators [7], one\nhas to conclude that lower dimensional operators cannot be a source of the observed baryon\nasymmetry.\nThe problem of CP T -odd baryogenesis was readdressed in [8] and recently in [9, 10].\nIn [8] and [9] among other options higher-dimensional CP T -odd operators were suggested\nas a source for baryon asymmetry. Suppose that a dimension five operator that shifts the\ndispersion relations of baryons relative to antibaryons is added on top of the SM. Let us\nfurther assume that initial value for B \u2212 L is zero. Then in the temperature range from\n1010 to 102 GeV where the sphaleron processes are in thermal equilibrium, the resulting\nbaryon asymmetry will be determined by the amount of CP T violation in the theory. If\nCP T -violating interactions are given by a dimension five operator parametrized by 1/\u039bCP T ,\nthe inverse energy scale of CP T violation, the resulting baryon asymmetry at the sphaleron\n\n\f3\nfreeze-out (T \u223c MW ) will be given by\n\u2206b\ns\n\nYb =\n\n\u223c\n\nT\n\n\u223c\n\n\u039bCP T\n\nMW\n,\n\u039bCP T\n\n(1)\n\nwhere s is the entropy. It is clear then that \u039bCP T < 1012 GeV will be required to produce\nan observable asymmetry. Given the fact that both low-energy data and astrophysical\nconstraints limit a typical scale \u039bCP T to be higher than the Planck scale, such scenario is\ncompletely ruled out.\nIn this paper we explore the idea of the CP T -odd leptogenesis that is capable of enhancing\nestimate (1) by many orders of magnitude. The main feature of any leptogenesis scenario is\nthe use of the lepton number non-conservation at high temperatures that results in a nonvanishing B\u2212L number, that is preserved by sphaleron processes [11]. One of the advantages\nof leptogenesis is that the most natural way of mediating the lepton-violating processes is\nthrough heavy majorana neutrinos, which also supply masses to the light neutrinos via the\nsee-saw mechanism. Heavy right-handed neutrinos with mass MR mediate lepton number\nviolating processes, and thus keep lepton number violating processes in equilibrium until the\ntemperature decreases to the point where the Hubble rate \u0393H begins to dominate over the\nlepton-violation rate \u0393L . In the assumption that Yukawa couplings are on the order one,\nthis moment in Universe's history can be determined as\n\u0393L \u221d\n\nT3\nMR2\n\n\u223c \u0393H\n\n\u221d\n\nT2\n,\nMPl\n\nwhich gives an estimate for the temperature of the freeze-out for the B \u2212 L number:\nMR2\n.\nMPl\n\nTR \u221d\n\nTherefore, in the scenarios of CP T -odd leptogenesis, one obtains the asymmetry which\nfreezes out at T = TR rather than at T = MW :\nYl(b) \u223c\n\nMR2\n.\nMPl \u039bCP T\n\nObviously, for MR \u223c 1015 GeV one gets a great enhancement by TR /MW \u223c 109 over the\nCP T baryogenesis scenarios (1) where B \u2212 L is zero.\nThe purpose of this paper is to explore the CP T -odd leptogenesis scenario, determine\nthe required strength of the CP T -violating operators, and confront it with the existing\nlaboratory and astrophysics constraints. For reasons explained earlier, we concentrate on\n\n\f4\nCP T -odd interactions of mass dimension five. We introduce CP T -odd operators into the\nfermion sector of the Standard Model [12]:\nLLV\n\n=\n\nX\n\n\u03b7i\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 * \u03c8 i \u03b3\u03bc D\u03bd D\u03c1 \u03c8i ,\n\n(2)\n\ni=L,E,Q,U,D\n\nwhich cause an asymmetric shift of the dispersion relations for fermions and antifermions.\nHere \u03b7i\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 is a symmetric irreducible Lorentz violating spurion field, that can depend on the\ntype of the SM fermions, and the summation extends over all fields that carry the lepton\nor baryon number. The transmutation to the lower-dimensional operators can be protected\nby the irreducibility condition, \u03b7 \u03bc\u03bd\u03bd = 0. A zeroth component of \u03b7i\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1 , \u03b7i000 \u2261 \u03b7i in the\nreference frame where the primordial plasma is at rest provides an asymmetric shift in the\ndispersion relations for particles and antiparticles. This way positive \u03b7lepton creates a surplus\nof antileptons over leptons in equilibrium which is maintained when the rate for the lepton\nnumber violating processes is faster than the Hubble expansion. It is notable, that such\nCP T -odd perturbations allow for potential leptogenesis already with one flavor of heavy\nmajorana neutrinos, whereas conventional leptogenesis requires at least two of them [11].\nIn the rest of this paper, we examine closely the kinetic equations for the L(B)-violating\nprocesses when CP T -odd shifts (2), lepton-number violation and sphaleron processes are\ntaken into account. We adjust the coupling constants \u03b7 in (2) in such a way as to produce\nthe observed value of the baryon asymmetry and compare the results with the existing\nlimits on Lorentz violating (LV) interactions. We argue that the combination of bounds on\nLV from observations of high-energy cosmic rays [13] and the low-energy clock comparison\nexperiments render the CP T -odd leptogenesis scenario fine-tuned for models with operators\nof mass dimension five (2), but allow it for higher-dimensional operators.\n\nII.\n\nREACTION RATES AND BOLTZMANN EQUATIONS\n\nTo demonstrate how the CP T -odd leptogenesis works we consider a model with only one\nheavy majorana neutrino. Its off-shell exchange mediates lepton number violating processes\nthat freeze out at the temperatures well below MR . At T > TR these processes maintain the\nequilibrium value for the lepton number asymmetry. In this section we calculate the rate of\nthe lepton number violating processes and include it in the Boltzmann equations together\nwith the sphaleron rate.\n\n\f5\nThe mass term Lagrangian for heavy neutrinos reads as\nLm = \u2212\n\n1\nMR N M NM + ha * La HNM + h\u2020a * N M H \u2020 La ,\n2\n\n(3)\n\nwhere NM are singlet majorana neutrinos and ha are the Yukawa couplings. We switch to\nWeyl spinors for convenience, in which the Lagrangian can be rewritten as\nLm = \u2212\n\n\u0001\n1\nMR NN + N N + ha * La N H + h\u2020a * H \u2020 NLa ,\n2\n\n(4)\n\nwhere index a runs over three different generations, and\n\uf8f1 \uf8fc\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4 N\u03b1 \uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f4 .\n\uf8f4\nNM = \uf8f4\n\uf8f4\n\uf8fe\n\uf8f3N \u03b1\u0307 \uf8f4\n\nIntegrating out the heavy neutrinos, one obtains an effective lepton number violating vertex:\nLeff\n\n=\n\nYij\u03bd\nH \u2020 L\u03b1i H \u2020 Lj\u03b1 + h.c.,\n2 MR\n\n(5)\n\nwhere Yab\u03bd = h\u2020a h\u2020b . Substituting the vacuum expectation value for the Higgs field in (5)\ncreates a majorana mass term for light neutrinos. This interaction induces lepton number\nviolating processes which determine the lepton asymmetry until the lepton freeze-out. Alternatively, we could step by the stage with the heavy right-handed neutrinos and postulate\n(5) as a starting point in our analysis while taking Yab\u03bd to be an arbitrary complex symmetric\nmatrix.\nIntroduction of the CP T -odd interactions (2) leads to the modification of dispersion\nrelations for the SM leptons and antileptons. Taking lepton doublets, we neglect the mass\nterms and find\nEL (p) = |~p| + \u03b7L ~p2 ,\n\nEL\u0304 (p) = |~p| \u2212 \u03b7L p~2 .\n\n(6)\n\nEquation (6) leads to a shift in the equilibrium number density of leptons\n\u0013\n\u0012\n12 \u03b7L\ngL\neq\n,\n1 \u2212\nnL =\n\u03c02\u03b2 3\n\u03b2\nwith the opposite sign of the shift for antileptons. Here gL is the total number of the spin,\ngauge and flavor degrees of freedom associated with electroweak doublets L, and \u03b2 is the\ninverse temperature. The difference,\neq\n2 4 \u22121\nneq\ni \u2212 n\u012b = \u221224 \u03b7i gi (\u03c0 \u03b2 ) ,\n\n(7)\n\n\f6\nL\n\nH\n\nL\n\nL\n\nL\n\nH\n\nH\n\nH\n\nFigure 1: \u2206L = 2 processes generated by the effective vertex (5).\n\nwhere i = L for now, represents an equilibrium lepton number induced by CP T violation in\nthe lepton doublet sector. As stated in the Introduction section, the final abundance can be\nroughly estimated by evaluating the equilibrium density at the temperature of the freezeout. A more accurate answer, however, can be obtained by analyzing Boltzmann equations\nin the presence of sphaleron processes and lepton number violation.\nThere are two types of interactions induced by the effective Lepton-Higgs vertex [14, 15],\nshown in Fig. 1. They generate the following processes relevant for leptogenesis:\nL + L \u2190\u2192 H + H\nL + H\n\n\u2190\u2192 L + H ,\n\nwith the same set of processes for antileptons. However, since the relevant part of the CP T odd interactions is time reversal invariant, the amplitudes for direct and inverse processes\nare equal, and we therefore have only three different amplitudes, which we call ALL , ALL\nand ALH .

The factor of two in the right hand side of (8) reflects the fact\nthat the LL processes change the number of leptons by two. An important thing to note\nis that even though we could have modified the dispersion relations for the Higgs field, its\nCP T -violating parameter would not enter the equations for the lepton number density at\ntree level.\nIn order to generalize equations (8) onto the full set of SM fields, we introduce the effective\nparameters of CP T violation in the lepton and baryon sectors:\n\u03b7l =\n\ngL \u03b7L + gE \u03b7E\n;\ngL + gE\n\n\u03b7b =\n\ngQ \u03b7Q + gU \u03b7U + gD \u03b7D\n,\ngQ + gU + gD\n\n(9)\n\nwhere gi is the corresponding number of degrees of freedom in each sector. These parameters\nenter (7) with i = l, b, and gl = gL + gE , gb = gQ + gU + gD .\nAs already mentioned, one also has to include sphaleron processes, which affects one\nlinear combination of baryon and lepton number densities. The main effect of sphalerons is\nto wash-out B + L, while keeping B \u2212 L intact. Since the processes we consider occur far\nabove the electroweak transition, the sphaleron rate has linear dependence on temperature\n[3, 16]. In the presence of CP T violation, the sphaleron contribution to the Boltzmann\nequation for nl , nb [3, 17, 18] should be modified for the presence of the equilibrium baryon\nand lepton numbers (7):\n\u2202t (nb + nl )\nwhere\n\n=\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8fc\neq \uf8fe\n\u2212 \u0393sph \uf8f3nb \u2212 neq\n+\nn\n\u2212\nn\n,\nl\nb\nl\n\n\u0393sph \u2243 \u03c9 T ,\n\n(10)\n\nwith \u03c9 \u2243 10\u22125 .\n\nEquation (10) implies that B + L is washed out completely, and is somewhat simplifed\nrelative to the realistic case. A detailed analysis shows (see e.g. [19]) that the wash-out is\nonly partial, with the final value of B + L controlled by a nonzero B \u2212 L, but we will employ\n\n\f8\nthe naive evolution equation (10), arguing that the corrections to this equation are much\nsmaller than the uncertainty with which \u03c9 is known.\nNext we make a well-justified assumption of smallness of the chemical potentials,\nni\nneq\ni\n\n= e\u03bci /T\n\n\u2243 1 + \u03bci /T ,\n\nwhich enables us to linearize the kinetic equations in \u03bci . The kinetic equations for nl take\nthe following form:\n\uf8f1\n\uf8fc\n\uf8f1\n\uf8fc\n\uf8f1\n\uf8fc\n\uf8f3\u2202t + 3\u0393H \uf8fe nl = \u2212 \uf8f34 WLL + 2 WLH \uf8fe \u03bcl /T \u2212 \u03c9 T \uf8f3\u03bcl /T + \u03bcb /T \uf8fe\n\uf8fc\n\uf8f1\n\uf8fc\n\uf8f1\n\uf8fc\n\uf8f1\n\uf8fe\n\uf8f3\n\uf8fe .\n\uf8f3\u2202t + 3\u0393H \uf8fe n =\n\uf8f34 W\nW\n\u03bc\n/T\n+\n\u03c9\nT\n\u03bc\n/T\n+\n\u03bc\n/T\n+\n2\nLH\nl\nl\nb\nLL\nl\n\n(11)\n\nFor the (anti)baryons the kinetic equations are the same except that there are no contri-\n\nbutions from the lepton number violating rates. A significant simplification comes from the\nsmallness of the chemical potential. There are two possible sources for CP T -odd contributions to the reaction rates in (8): modified dispersion relations and CP T -odd modifications\nof thermal rates. The smallness of \u03bci /T allows us to neglect any CP T -odd effects in the\nreaction rates in the right hand side of (8), as they induce effects of the 2nd order in the\nCP T -violating parameter. Therefore, we take WLL = WLL and W LH = WLH .\nFrom the above equations we only need their difference, the actual lepton (baryon) asymmetry. For convenience, we express the equilibrium number density in terms of the unmodified number density n0i = gi /\u03c0 2 * T 3\nneq\n= n0i ( 1 \u2213 12 \u03b7i T ) ,\ni,i\n\ni = l, b .\n\nThe asymmetries Yi then can be defined as\nni \u2212 ni \u2261 2 n0i * Yi ,\n\nYi = \u03bci /T\n\n\u2212 12 \u03b7i T .\n\nWe also introduce a dimensionless parameter \u03b3, by factoring out the dimensionful parameters\nT 3 /MR2 from the rate of lepton number violating processes,\n4 WLL + 2 WLH\n\n= \u03b3\n\nT6\n,\nMR2\n\nso that \u03b3 scales as the fourth power of the neutrino Yukawa couplings or the sum of the\nsquares of the eigenvalues of Yab\u03bd :\n\u03b3 =\n\n\uf8fc2\nX\n3 \uf8f1\n3\n\u03bd\u2020\n2\uf8fe\n\u03bd\n\uf8f3\n|h\n|\nYdiag\n).\n= 2 Tr (Ydiag\na\n2\n2\u03c0\n2\u03c0\n\n(12)\n\n\f9\nExpressing equations (11) in terms of Yi and changing variables from time to temperature,\nwe get:\ngl\n\nd\nYl\ndT\n\n=\n+\n\ngb\n\nd\nYb\ndT\n\n=\n\n\uf8fc\n0.6 \u03c9 MPl \uf8f1\n\uf8f3gl ( Yl + 12 \u03b7l T ) + gb ( Yb + 12 \u03b7b T )\uf8fe\n1/2\nT2\ng\u2217\n\n0.6 \u03c0 2 \u03b3 MPl\n* ( Yl + 12 \u03b7l T )\n1/2\nMR2\ng\u2217\n\uf8fc\n0.6 \u03c9 MPl \uf8f1\n\uf8f3gl ( Yl + 12 \u03b7l T ) + gb ( Yb + 12 \u03b7b T )\uf8fe .\n1/2\nT2\ng\u2217\n\n(13)\n\nThe quantity of the ultimate interest is the baryon asymmetry at the present time (normalized, e.g. on the photon number density, n\u03b3 = s/7.04 [20]).

(17) is also an estimate for the BAU.\n\nIII.\n\nTHE STRENGTH OF CP T VIOLATION DERIVED FROM BAU\n\nIn this section, we provide the numerical solutions to equations (13), determine the\nrequired strength of CP T violation and confront it with existing experimental constraints.\n\n\f10\nTo solve the system of kinetic equations, one has to add proper initial conditions. It is\nreasonable to impose these initial conditions at the temperatures where the essential part\nof leptogenesis begins, which we take to be MR = 1015 GeV:\nYl\n\nMR\n\n= Yleq ,\n\nYb\n\nMR\n\n= 0.\n\n(18)\n\nAt high temperatures leptons and antileptons were in thermal and chemical equilibrium,\nwhich had a nonzero value of the lepton number defined by \u03b7l . This choice is quite sensible\nsince the freeze-out temperature TR suggested by neutrino masses is sufficiently smaller than\nMR . As for baryons, we impose symmetric nb = nb\u0304 conditions at high temperatures (1015\nGeV), as there are no fast processes that would bring Yb to the equilibrium position set by\n\u03b7b .\nSince we chose to fix MR , the only free parameters left are \u03b7i and \u03b7b parametrizing the\nstrength of CP T violation, and the neutrino Yukawa couplings. For the latter there is some\nnatural range suggested by the oscillations among the light neutrino flavors. Introducing an\n\"effective\" neutrino mass that the kinetic equations (13) depend on,\n\u0012 P \u03bd 2 2 \u00131/2\n\u0010X\n\u00111/2\n|Ydiag | v\n,\n\u2261\nmeff\nm\n=\n\u03bd\n\u03bd\ni\n2MR\n\n(19)\n\n2\n2\nwe notice that (meff\n\u03bd ) is larger than any of the individual \u2206mij measured in the oscillations\n\nexperiments. Thus, taking the largest of \u2206m2ij suggested by the oscillation of atmospheric\np\nneutrinos, \u2206m2atm \u2243 0.05 eV [21] we find the following natural range for meff\n\u03bd :\n0.05 eV \u2264 meff\n\u03bd \u2264 0.65 eV ,\n\n(20)\n\nwhere the upper limit comes from the cosmological bound on the sum of neutrino masses\n[22]. Defining the freeze-out temperature via relation \u0393H (TR ) = \u0393L (TR ), one can translate\n(20) to the realistic range of TR :\n1012 GeV < TR < 1014 GeV .\n\n(21)\n\nOn the lower end of this range TR overlaps with the sphaleron ignition temperature Tsph ,\nwhich is estimated to be of the order 1012 GeV [23].\nThe final result of our analysis is the prediction for the strength of CP T violation in\nlepton and baryons sectors.

One notices that \u03b7b does not change\nmuch in the \"physical\" region. For \u03b7l -dominated scenario, in contrast, the increase of \u03b7l\neff\nwith meff\n\u03bd is well pronounced. As expected, the lower mass m\u03bd leads to a higher freeze-out\n\ntemperature TR , and thus lower meff\n\u03bd requires lower CP T violating parameter \u03b7l to get an\nobserved value of BAU. Also not surprisingly, \u03b7l and \u03b7b required to reproduce BAU in our\nscenario have opposite signs.\nThe lower end of the range (20) corresponds to a hierarchical scenario m21 , m22 \u226a m23 ,\nwith the tau-neutrino being the heaviest.

The modification of dispersion relation by dimension five operators\nhas been discussed at length in the literature. Below we list a set of relevant constraints on\ndimension five operators in the fermionic sector of the SM and comment on their applicability:\n|\u03b7d \u2212 \u03b7Q \u2212 0.5(\u03b7u \u2212 \u03b7Q )| < 10\u221227 GeV\u22121 ,\n\n[12, 24]\n\n|\u03b7L |, |\u03b7E | < 10\u221220 GeV\u22121 ,\n\n[25]\n\n|\u03b7L |, |\u03b7E | < 10\u221233 GeV\u22121 .\n\n[13]\n\nThe first constraint arises because the axial-vector-like combinations of \u03b7i in the quark\nsector lead to the coupling of the nucleon spin to a preferred direction. In models where\nthe preferred frame is associated with the rest frame of the cosmic microwave background,\nthe net spin energy shift is proportional to the velocity of the lab frame v \u223c O(10\u22123),\n\n\f14\n\u039b2QCD \u03b7i (v * s), which is to be compared with the experimental sensitivity 10\u221231 GeV [26, 27].\nThe low-energy constraints on lepton operators are considerably weaker [12]. The strongest\nconstraints on dimension five CP T -odd operators in the lepton sector come from considerations of p \u2192 pl \u0304l processes that become energetically allowed and prevent acceleration\nof protons to energies of \u223c 1021 eV. It is important that constraints [13] are double-sided,\nwhich is the consequence of asymmetric modification of dispersion relation for leptons and\nantileptons (6).\nThe strength of CP T violation in the lepton sector derived from the baryon asymmetry\n(22) is consistent with the astrophysical bounds on CP T -violating QED [25], but appears\nto be grossly inconsistent with [13]. In fact, typical constraints on dimension five operators\n[13] derived from the existence of the high-energy cosmic rays appear to destroy any hopes\nfor the CP T -odd baryogenesis, even if the scale of TR is pushed all the way up to the Planck\nscale. It is easy to see, however, that this is not the case. If CP T -odd sources in the\nquark sector dominate over the lepton sources by a factor of 20-30, strong constraints on\nCP T violation might be avoided. If, for example, among the CP T -odd sources the righthanded up quark has the largest modification of its dispersion relation, the energetically\nfavored process p \u2192 \u2206++ \u03c0 \u2212 allows the ultra high-energy cosmic rays to exist in the form\nof \u2206++ , an option which cannot be observationally ruled out [13]. It is very important\nto observe that the negative sign of \u03b7U suggested by BAU (22) is exactly the sign of \u03b7U\nneeded for p \u2192 \u2206++ \u03c0 \u2212 to happen at high energies. Nevertheless, the required size of \u03b7U ,\n\u03b7U \u223c \u2212(10\u221223 \u221210\u221222 ) GeV\u22121 appears to be in sharp conflict with the low-energy constraints\n[12, 24], and at least four orders of magnitude tuning for dimension five sources is needed.\nThis consideration shows an important complementarity between the astrophysical bounds\non Lorentz violation and low-energy searches of the breakdown of rotational invariance.\nWe can extend our analysis to theories where CP T violation comes from operators of\ndimension seven, nine, etc., should for some contrived reasons lower dimensional operators\nbe absent. We note that to sufficient accuracy, the resulting BAU will be determined by the\nequilibrium lepton asymmetry at the freeze-out time, \u03b7 (7) TR3 , \u03b7 (9) TR3 , where \u03b7 (n) parametrize\nthe strengths of the higher dimensional operators:\nL =\n\nX\n\n(n)\n\u03c8\u03b3 \u03ba D \u03bc ...D \u03bd \u03c8.\n\u03b7\u03ba\u03bc...\u03bd\n\nAs before, the transmutation to lower-dimensional operators can be forbidden by the irre-\n\n\f15\nducibility of \u03b7 (n) tensors.\nThe low-energy constraints on dimension seven and higher CP T -odd operators are totally\nirrelevant, as the possible influence on the nucleon spin is suppressed by extra power(s) of\n(\u039bQCD /\u039bCP T )2 . The constraints coming from the propagation of the high-energy cosmic\nrays are harder to avoid, as their relative strength scales down as (Emax /\u039bCP T )2 , where\nEmax is the maximal energy of the high-energy cosmic rays Emax \u223c 1012 GeV. In fact, since\nthe decoupling temperature TR can only be marginally larger than 1012 GeV, the CP T violating sources of dimension seven in the lepton sector allowed by the cosmic rays would\nnot be able to produce the required size of the baryon asymmetry. However, the same\nloophole with the stability of \u2206++ at high-energies exists for the dimension seven operators,\nand the right-handed up-quark CP T violation at the level of\n(7)\n\n\u03b7U = \u2212[(1017 \u2212 1018 ) GeV]\u22123\n\n(23)\n\nresults in the right magnitude of BAU while avoiding all experimental constraints on Lorentz\nand CP T violation.\n\nV.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nWe have seen that the presence of CP T -odd interactions is theoretically capable of replacing two of Sakharov's conditions of baryogenesis: non-conservation of CP symmetry and\ndeparture from thermodynamical equilibrium. The reason for this is that non-zero lepton\n(or baryon) asymmetry can develop even in thermal equilibrium if the CP T -violating shifts\nof dispersion relations for particles and antiparticles and fermion number violating processes\nare operative at the same time [4]. In this paper, we considered in detail the idea of leptogenesis driven by CP T -violating sources in the fermionic sector of the Standard Model. In this\nscenario, the generation of the B \u2212 L number occurs at temperatures of about 1012 \u2212 1014\nGeV, which results in a huge enhancement of the asymmetry as compared to the CP T -odd\nelectroweak baryogenesis scenario, where B \u2212 L = 0 and the equilibrium value for B + L\nis maintained until the electroweak breaking, T \u223c 100 GeV. Consequently, the CP T -odd\nleptogenesis requires only trans-Planckian size of CP T violation, \u03b7i \u223c 10\u221222 \u2212 10\u221224 GeV\u22121 .\nWe believe that this is the minimal level of CP T violation required to reproduce the\nobservable asymmetry. Lower levels of CP T -breaking may generate BAU only at the expense\n\n\f16\nof raising the decoupling temperature for B \u2212L processes, to the range of the e.g. GUT scale.\nModels with such a high initial temperature possess very serious cosmological problems of\ntheir own related to the overproduction of dangerous relics (monopoles, gravitinos), and are\ndifficult to incorporate into inflation.\nThe most natural models of CP -odd leptogenesis require two heavy neutrino singlets to\nwork. We have shown that one species is perfectly sufficient for the CP T -odd scenario. In\nfact, one could take even more conservative approach and associate the majorana masses\nof light neutrinos with the effective Lorentz-conserving interaction (5) without specifying\nits origin. The CP T -odd leptogenesis in this case will proceed exactly as described in the\npaper, as long as (5) remains unsuppressed at high energies. As a consequence of the reduced\nheavy sector, the connection to the phenomenology of light neutrinos becomes more direct.\nAs shown, the rate of the lepton-number violating processes is directly proportional to the\nsum of the mass squared of all light neutrino species.\nConfronting the predicted size of CP T -violation with the existing experimental and astrophysical constraints we find that both the low-energy precision searches of preferred directions and the astrophysical constraints derived from the existence of charged high-energy\ncosmic rays puts severe constraints on CP T -odd leptogenesis. The latter, being especially\nstringent, rules out a possibility of CP T -odd leptogenesis driven by \u03b7l when \u03b7b = 0. The\ninverse case, \u03b7l = 0; \u03b7b 6= 0 cannot be ruled out from the astrophysical considerations, as\nthe bounds would not apply if e.g. the CP T violation is concentrated in the right-handed\nup-quark sector. In this case, however, one should expect sizable effects in the clock comparison experiments. Current sensitivity to such operators is at the level of 10\u221227 GeV\u22121 ,\nand thus would require at least four orders of magnitude fine-tuning to make (22) evade the\nbounds.\nThe CP T -odd interactions that modify dispersion relations represent a relatively small\nsubset of dimension five CP T -odd interactions [28]. Is it feasible that other operators could\ndrive (baryo)leptogenesis while evading strong astrophysical and laboratory constraints?\nIf physics responsible for CP T violation preserves supersymmetry, operators that modify\ndispersion relations are simply not allowed [29, 30]. Instead, a different class of CP T -odd\noperators may appear:\nL\u0304\u03b3\u03bc LH \u2020 H, Q\u0304\u03b3\u03bc QH \u2020 H, etc.\n\n(24)\n\nWhen the lepton or baryon number is calculated in equilibrium, such operators will create\n\n\f17\nan effective chemical potential that grows with temperature, \u03bc \u223c T 2 \u03b6, where \u03b6 parametrizes\nthe strength of CP T violation. The easiest way to see that is to consider the thermal field\ntheory correlator between the baryon/lepton number density and such CP T -odd operators.\nInside a thermal loop, the Higgs field bilinear will produce T 2 , and the scaling of the effective\nchemical potential with temperature will be exactly the same as in the case of \u03b7i operators.\nAlthough operators (24) do not influence the propagation of the high-energy cosmic rays,\nthey have a phenomenological \"problem\" of their own. Inside loops such operators create\nquadratic divergencies and generate dimension three CP T -odd operators proportional to\nthe square of the ultraviolet cutoff. In the most UV-protected case, the role of this cutoff is\nassumed by the supersymmetric soft-breaking scale. Still, the strength of typical constraints\n\u22121\nis on the order of 10\u221210 MPl\n[30], making the scenario driven by (24) fine-tuned below 1 ppm\n\nlevel. Finally, what if CP T -violation is concentrated in the heavy right-handed neutrino\nsector? Phenomenology of such model was addressed in [31], where it was shown that loop\neffects reintroduce CP T violation in the sector of charged leptons. Upon integrating out\nheavy neutrino fields, one produces operators similar to (24), and therefore such possibility\nis also fine-tuned.\nOur main conclusion is that the natural levels of CP T /Lorentz violation suggested by the\nCP T -odd (lepto)baryogenesis scenario are 10\u22123 \u2212 10\u22125 in the Planck mass units, which is\nwell within the ranges already disfavored by the laboratory experiments and observations of\nthe high-energy cosmic rays. This analysis relies on the spurion approach to CP T violation,\nwhich assumes that the strength of the CP T -odd source was essentially the same in the\nearly Universe and today. It is of course conceivable that the dynamical effects could have\nbeen responsible for the CP T breaking at high temperatures, sourcing the baryogenesis,\nwith relaxation of CP T sources to zero at the later stage [32].\nAcknowledgements.
