We present a 39 h integration with the Odin satellite on the ground-state 118.75 GHz line of O2\ntowards the region of strongest molecular emission in the Small Magellanic Cloud. Our 3\u03c3 upper limit to the\nO2 integrated intensity of < 0.049 K km s\u22121 in a 9\u2032 (160 pc) diameter beam corresponds to an upper limit on\nthe O2 /H2 abundance ratio of < 1.3 \u00d7 10\u22126 . Although a factor of 20 above the best limit on the O2 abundance\nobtained for a Galactic source, our result has interesting implications for understanding oxygen chemistry at subsolar metal abundances. We compare our abundance limit to a variety of astrochemical models and find that, at\nlow metallicities, the low O2 abundance is most likely produced by the effects of photo-dissociation on molecular\ncloud structure. Freeze-out of molecules onto dust grains may also be consistent with the observed abundance\nlimit, although such models have not yet been run at sub-solar initial metallicities.\nKey words. galaxies: individual: SMC \u2013 ISM: molecules \u2013 astrochemistry\n\n1. Introduction\nOxygen chemistry in the interstellar medium is still not\nwell understood. Despite having an abundance that is\nroughly twice that of carbon, oxygen-bearing species are\ndifficult to observe in the gas phase. Molecular oxygen,\noriginally predicted to be almost as abundant as CO under some conditions (Graedel et al. 1982), remains elusive.\nAlthough O2 is not a significant reservoir of oxygen in the\ngas phase (Bergin et al. 2000), a detection of O2 would be\nvery helpful in distinguishing among the many different\nastrochemical models developed to explain its low abundance (see review in Goldsmith et al. 2000). In this Letter,\nwe present upper limits for the O2 abundance towards a\nsingle line of sight in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC)\nSend offprint requests to: C. Wilson\n\u22c6\nBased on observations with Odin, a Swedish-led satellite\nproject funded jointly by the Swedish National Space Board\n(SNSB), the Canadian Space Agency (CSA), the National\nTechnology Agency of Finland (Tekes), and Centre National\nd'Etudes Spatiales (CNES). The Swedish Space Corporation\nwas the industrial prime contractor and is also responsible for\nthe satellite operation.\n\nand discuss the implications of our results for astrochemical models of gas at low metallicities.\nMolecular oxygen has not yet been detected convincingly in any source in the Milky Way. Goldsmith et al.\n(2000) report 3\u03c3 upper limits on the O2 abundance from\nthe SWAS satellite of < 2.6 \u00d7 10\u22127 in star-forming clouds\nand < 3 \u00d7 10\u22126 in cold dark clouds. Pagani et al. (2003)\npresent improved O2 upper limits from the Odin satellite,\nwith 3\u03c3 upper limits to the O2 abundance in 11 sources\nranging from < 5.2 \u00d7 10\u22128 to < 5.7 \u00d7 10\u22127 . Goldsmith\net al. (2002) report a possible detection in the \u03c1 Oph A\noutflow with N (O2 )/N (H2 ) \u223c 10\u22125 . However, the Odin\nupper limit over a similar region of the sky is < 9.3 \u00d7 10\u22128\n(Pagani et al. 2003) and so the SWAS detection must be\nconsidered tentative at best.\nExtragalactic sources at moderate redshifts have their\nO2 lines shifted away from high opacity regions of the\nEarth's atmosphere. Liszt (1985, 1992) obtained an upper\nlimit to the O2 /CO abundance ratio of 0.1 in four Seyfert\ngalaxies. By searching for O2 in absorption in a system at\nz \u223c 0.685 towards the radio source B0218+357, Combes\net al. (1997) obtained a 3\u03c3 upper limit to the O2 /CO\n\n\f2\n\nWilson et al.: Searching for O2 in the SMC\n\nFig. 1.

If the CO abundance in this\nextragalactic source is similar to that in Galactic molecular clouds, the 3\u03c3 upper limit to the O2 /H2 abundance\nratio would be 6 \u00d7 10\u22127 . Thus, even the most sensitive\nextragalactic O2 searches have now been surpassed by the\nGalactic results from Odin and SWAS (Goldsmith et al.\n2000; Pagani et al. 2003).\nThere have been no previous searches for O2 emission\nfrom objects with low intrinsic metal abundance. Frayer\n& Brown (1997) present a set of astrochemical evolution\nmodels aimed at predicting the abundances of key molecular species, including O2 , in high-redshift galaxies. Their\nresults suggest that the molecular oxygen abundance is\nenhanced when the metallicity is reduced by even a factor of a few relative to the solar abundance. These results\nmotivated us to search for O2 emission towards the Small\nMagellanic Cloud (SMC), which has an oxygen abundance\n12 + log(O/H) = 7.96 (Vermeij & van der Hulst 2002) or\n0.16 times the abundance of Orion (Peimbert et al. 1993).\nAt a distance of 60 kpc (Harries et al. 2003) previous CO\nobservations (Rubio et al. 1991) suggest that molecular\nemission should fill a substantial fraction of the large Odin\nbeam (9\u2032 at 119 GHz), which makes the SMC the ideal\ntarget to search for O2 emission from low-metallicity gas.\n\n2. Observations and Analysis\nWe observed the position SW-1 in the SMC (Rubio et\nal. 1991) with Odin for 158 orbits (39.2 h on-source) between 2004 May 13 and 2004 June 2. The beam diameter of Odin's 1.1 m telescope is 9\u2032 at the 118.750 GHz\nfrequency of the O2 11 \u2212 10 line with a main beam efficiency of 0.9 (Frisk et al. 2003). The observations were\nmade in position-switch mode with the off position at\n(+30\u2032 ,0). The pointing is estimated to be accurate to 15\u2032\u2032 .\nThe typical single sideband system temperature of the O2\n\nHEMT receiver (Frisk et al. 2003) during this period was\nTsys \u223c 950 K. The O2 receiver was not phase-locked during these observations, so the true frequency was recovered\nusing telluric lines observed when the Odin beam passed\nthrough the Earth's atmosphere at the beginning and end\nof each orbit (see Larsson et al. 2003 for a detailed description of the method applied to the NH3 line). Satellite\ntests indicate a frequency stability of better than 1 MHz\n(2.6 km s\u22121 ). The backend was an autocorrelator with a\nspectral resolution of 125 kHz (0.316 km s\u22121 ) and 700\nchannels for a total bandwidth of 87 MHz (220 km s\u22121 ).\nThe spectrum was fit with a 5th order polynomial baseline over the velocity range -35 to 155 km s\u22121 . A window\nof 20 km s\u22121 centered on VLSR = 120 km s\u22121 , the observed velocity of the CO J=1-0 line (Rubio et al. 1991),\nwas excluded from the fit. No O2 line is detected in the\nfinal spectrum (Fig. 1), which has an rms noise of 7.3 mK\n(TA\u2217 ) per spectral channel. Using the formula from Pagani\net al. (2003) with the CO line width of 15.9 km s\u22121 observed in an 8.8\u2032 beam (Rubio et al. 1991), the 3\u03c3 upper\nlimit to the O2 integrated intensity is < 0.049 K km s\u22121 .\n\n3. An Upper Limit to the O2 /CO Abundance\nRatio\nWe need an estimate of the kinetic temperature to convert the O2 integrated intensity into an O2 column density, N (O2 ) (see Pagani et al. 2003 and references therein).\nThe Odin O2 beam contains a weak IRAS source (Rubio\net al. 1993) and also a 170 \u03bcm source seen by the Infrared\nSpace Observatory (Wilke et al. 2003). The 60 to 170 \u03bcm\nspectral energy distribution (SED) of this source (n5 #11)\nis more peaked towards longer wavelengths than is the\naverage SED for the SMC, which Wilke et al. (2004) fit\nwith three modified blackbodies of temperature 45 K,\n20.5 K, and 10 K. Thus, a kinetic temperature of 1020 K is probably most appropriate for the region observed by Odin. A kinetic temperature of T = 20 K gives\nN (O2 ) < 2.2 \u00d7 1015 cm\u22122 , while a temperature of 10 K\ngives N (O2 ) < 1.9 \u00d7 1015 cm\u22122 . We therefore adopt a\nvalue N (O2 ) < 2.0 \u00d7 1015 cm\u22122 as the 3\u03c3 upper limit to\nthe O2 column density in our further analysis.\nAt the position SMC-SW1, the CO J=1-0 integrated\nintensity in an 8.8\u2032 beam is \u223c 1 K km s\u22121 (Rubio et al.\n1991). Adopting a CO-to-H2 conversion factor of 1.5\u00d71021\ncm\u22122 (K km s\u22121 )\u22121 to account for the lower metallicity\nof the SMC (Wilson 1995) gives an H2 column density\nN (H2 ) = 1.5 \u00d7 1021 cm\u22122 . In the nearby region LIRS36,\nChin et al. (1998) measured a CO abundance of 1 \u00d7 10\u22125 .\nApplying this CO abundance to the broader SMC-SW1\nregion gives a CO column density N (CO) = 1.5 \u00d7 1016\ncm\u22122 . We can also estimate N (CO) directly from the CO\nintegrated intensity. Adopting the [12 CO]/[13 CO] abundance ratio measured in the solar neighborhood (\u223c 60,\nLanger & Penzias 1993) and a 12 CO/13 CO intensity ratio\nof \u223c 12 (Rubio et al. 1996) gives a 12 CO optical depth\nof \u223c 5. Using the formula from White & Sandell (1995)\nand adopting an excitation temperature of 20 K gives a\n\n\fWilson et al.: Searching for O2 in the SMC\n\nCO column density of 5.3 \u00d7 1015 cm\u22122 , roughly a factor of\nthree smaller than that derived via the CO-to-H2 conversion factor. For the rest of this paper, we adopt the H2 and\nCO column densities derived via the CO-to-H2 conversion\nfactor, which correspond to 3\u03c3 upper limits to the O2 /H2\nabundance of < 1.3 \u00d7 10\u22126 and the O2 /CO abundance of\n< 0.13, both averaged over a 150 pc diameter beam.\n\n4. Implications for Understanding Oxygen\nChemistry\nFor comparison with chemical models, it is useful to know\nthe gas-phase abundances of O and C in the SMC. Dufour\net al. (1988) derive a value of 12 + log(C/H) = 7.16 in HII\nregions in the SMC. Combining this with the O abundance from Vermeij & van der Hulst (2002) and in the\nabsence of any differential depletion of oxygen relative to\ncarbon onto dust grains, the SMC should have a ratio C/O\n= 0.16. This value is significantly smaller than the C/O\nabundance ratio of 0.4 that is commonly assumed as the\ninitial gas-phase abundance in astrochemical models.\n\n4.1. Comparison with Pure Gas-Phase Models\nGoldsmith et al. (2000) review the key processes and issues involved in oxygen chemistry at Galactic metallicities. Steady-state, pure gas-phase models predict O2 abundances of 5 \u2212 10 \u00d7 10\u22126 , much higher than the current\nobservational limits (Pagani et al. 2003). One way to decrease the gas phase abundance of O2 is to increase the\ngas phase C/O ratio to near unity via some kind of preferential depletion of O onto dust grains, presumably in the\nform of H2 O and other ices. Bergin et al. (2000) discuss\nresults for pure gas-phase models with C/O abundances\nranging from 0.4 to 1. To fit the observed low O2 abundances, either the gas phase C/O ratio must be close to\n1, or the gas must be \"chemically young\", i.e., have spent\nat most 105 yr in a high Av environment. This apparent\nyouthfulness can be produced by processes such as turbulent mixing of shielded and unshielded regions (i.e. Chi\u00e8ze\n& Pineau des For\u00eats 1989), which can reduce the O2 abundance by factors of 100-1000 compared to the steady state\nresults.\nThe SMC has a C/O ratio of 0.16, much lower than the\ninitial Galactic ratio of 0.4. For the Bergin et al. (2000)\ngas-phase model to be consistent with our new limit for\nthe O2 abundance in the SMC, either oxygen must be\npreferentially depleted even more strongly (by a factor of\nfive relative to the undepleted C/O ratio), or the gas in\nthe SMC must be both \"chemically young\" and suffer preferential oxygen depletion by a factor of \u223c 2.5. Both these\nscenarios seem unlikely, especially since there is still not a\ngood justification of why oxygen should be preferentially\ndepleted from the gas phase relative to carbon (Roberts\n& Herbst 2002).\nViti et al. (2001) discuss steady-state solutions of gasphase chemical models involving bi-stability solutions. In\ngeneral, if the gas ends up in the high ionization phase,\n\n3\n\nthen the O2 abundances are low and consistent with current upper limits. In the low ionization phase, the O2\nabundance is too high to be consistent with current upper limits. The bistability region occurs for 0.49 < C/O <\n0.66, with the high ionization phase being the sole solution for larger values of C/O. In addition, as the C/O ratio\ndecreases, the bi-stability region occurs at lower densities.\nThus, if the clouds in the SMC have relatively low densities (nH2 < 1000 cm\u22123 or lower), the gas could be in a\nsteady-state high ionization phase that meets our limits\non the O2 abundance.\nSpaans & van Dishoeck (2001) have run chemical models of clumpy clouds where the deeper penetration of the\nUV field affects the chemistry and find O2 abundances below 10\u22127 for nH2 \u223c 103 cm\u22123 . If the gas-phase abundance\nof oxygen is depleted by a factor of two, the O2 abundance\nin their models drops by a further factor of 20. However,\nthese models have been run only for solar C/O values.\n\n4.2. Comparison with Models Including Dust Grains\nAstrochemical models that include the effects of dust\ngrains appear promising for explaining the observed low\nabundance of O2 . Roberts & Herbst (2002) use recent laboratory results for the mobility of H on grains to model\nregions with T = 10 \u2212 20 K and nH2 = 104 \u2212 105 cm\u22123 .\nAll their models are consistent with the SMC limits for\nO2 abundance at a wide range of evolutionary times.\nHowever, it is important to note that their models have\ndifficulty producing the low Odin limit on O2 in L134N\n(Pagani et al. 2003).\nViti et al. (2001) present a grid of models that include\nthe effects of freeze-out of molecules onto grains. These\nmodels are generally consistent with our SMC upper limits, whether general freeze-out or selective freeze-out (with\nCO and N2 desorbing from the grains) is used. However,\nthese models use an initial C/O ratio of 0.5, which, for\nthe SMC, corresponds to preferential oxygen depletion by\na factor of 3. Viti et al. (2001) claim that the selective\nfreeze-out models give a chemistry similar to what would\nbe obtained with a C/O abundance ratio \u223c 1, although\nwhether that interpretation is true regardless of the initial\ngas-phase C/O ratio is not addressed in the paper.\n\n4.3. Comparison with Extragalactic Chemical Models\nFrayer & Brown (1997) combine galactic chemical evolution models with gas-phase astrochemical models to predict the abundance of O2 relative to CO averaged over an\nentire galaxy as a function of time and metallicity. Their\nmodels cover a wide range of average metallicity, use pure\ngas-phase astrochemistry, and consider both steady-state\nand \"early-time\" solutions from a variety of models. They\nalso consider selective depletion of oxygen in the gas phase\nby a factor of two, but this does not have a large impact on\nthe O2 /CO ratio at low metallicities. Interestingly, at the\nO/C ratio of the SMC (6.3), there is no significant differ-\n\n\f4\n\nWilson et al.: Searching for O2 in the SMC\n\nence in the predicted abundance ratio of O2 /CO at early\ntimes compared to steady state. Both sets of models predict O2 /CO ratios of 2-3, significantly larger than our new\nobservational limit of O2 /CO < 0.13. Thus, even earlytime gas-phase models appear to have difficulty matching\nour observations of the SMC.\nFrayer & Brown (1997) also consider the effects of\nphoto-dissociation in low metallicity gas. O2 has a higher\nphoto-dissociation rate than CO (van Dishoeck 1988) and\nso will have a smaller spatial extent inside a molecular\ncloud. For Galactic metallicities and UV fields, Frayer\n& Brown (1997) estimate that CO will be self-shielding\nwhere Av > 1.5 mag and O2 only where Av > 5 mag. At\nlower extinctions, the abundances of CO and O2 depend\non edge effects in the molecular cloud and are strongly\nnon-linear with extinction (see Frayer & Brown (1997)\nfor details). If the dust-to-gas ratio scales roughly linearly\nwith metallicity (Gordon et al. 2003), a molecular cloud\nin a low-metallicity galaxy may not be self-shielding in\nO2 even in its center and may just barely achieve strong\nself-shielding for CO. These effects produce a much lower\nabundance of CO and especially O2 compared to H2 in low\nmetallicity gas. Specifically, for the metallicity of the SMC,\nphoto-dissociation reduces the O2 /CO ratio to a value of\n\u223c 0.05. Thus, gas-phase astrochemical models which include the effects of photo-dissociation at low metallicities\nappear to be consistent with our new observational limit.\n\n5. Conclusions\nA very deep (39 h) integration on the ground state line\nof O2 with the Odin satellite has failed to detect any O2\nemission towards the region SW1 in the SMC. Our 3\u03c3 upper limit on the O2 integrated intensity of 0.049 K km\ns\u22121 translates into an upper limit on the O2 column density of N (O2 ) < 2.0 \u00d7 1015 cm\u22122 . We have combined this\nmeasurement with published CO J=1-0 data for the same\nregion to place a limit on the molecular oxygen abundance\nO2 /H2 < 1.3 \u00d7 10\u22126 and on the O2 /CO abundance ratio\nof < 0.13. Although the O2 abundance limit is substantially higher than the best limit set for a Galactic source\n(< 5 \u00d7 10\u22128 , Pagani et al. 2003), it is still an interesting\nprobe of astrochemistry in low metallicity gas.\nIn contrast to the Galaxy, \"chemically young\" models appear to be ruled out for the SMC (Frayer & Brown\n1997). Gas-phase models where the oxygen has been preferentially depleted from the gas phase compared to carbon do agree with our upper limit for the O2 abundance.\nHowever, the depletion required for the SMC is a factor\nof two larger than that required to account for O2 limits\nin the Galaxy (Bergin et al. 2000), and there is as yet no\ngenerally accepted mechanism to produce such a depletion\n(Roberts & Herbst 2002).\nAstrochemical models which include the effects of\nphoto-dissociation produce an O2 /CO ratio of \u223c 0.05\n(Frayer & Brown 1997) and are consistent with our 3\u03c3\nupper limit. Models that include the effects of dust grains\nalso may be consistent with our observed upper limit, al-\n\nthough these models (Viti et al. 2001; Roberts & Herbst\n2002) have not yet been run for reduced metallicity gas.\nIf low-metallicity models that included dust grains were\nto fail to produce sufficiently low O2 abundances, then\nthe leading explanation for the low O2 abundance in low\nmetallicity gas would be the effect of photo-dissociation\non the structure of the molecular clouds (Frayer & Brown\n1997). This could stimulate renewed attention to the effect of clumpy cloud structures and photo-dissociation (i.e.\nSpaans & van Dishoeck 2001) in understanding the abundance of O2 in Galactic sources.\nAcknowledgements.
