The Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of a graded ring is an important invariant in computational commutative algebra, and there is increasing interest in multigraded generalizations. We study connections between\ntwo recent definitions of multigraded regularity with a view towards a better understanding of the multigraded Hilbert function of fat point schemes in\nPn1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Pnk .\n\nIntroduction\nLet k be an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. If M is a finitely\ngenerated graded module over a Z-graded polynomial ring over k, its CastelnuovoMumford regularity, denoted reg(M ), is an invariant that measures the difficulty of\ncomputations involving M. Recently, several authors (cf. [1, 18, 19]) have proposed\nextensions of the notion of regularity to a multigraded context.\nTaking our cue from the study of the Hilbert functions of fat points in Pn (cf.\n[5, 11, 23]), we apply these new notions of multigraded regularity to study the\ncoordinate ring of a scheme of fat points Z \u2286 Pn1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Pnk with the goal of\nunderstanding both the nature of regularity in a multigraded setting and what\nregularity may tell us about the coordinate ring of Z. This paper also complements\nthe investigation in [16] of the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of fat points in\nmultiprojective spaces.\nIn the study of the coordinate ring of a fat point scheme in Pn many authors\nhave found beautiful relationships between algebra, geometry, and combinatorics\n(cf. [17] for a survey when n = 2). Extensions and generalizations of such results\nto the multigraded setting are potentially of both theoretical and practical interest.\nSchemes of fat points in products of projective spaces arise in algebraic geometry\nin connection with secant varieties of Segre varieties (cf. [3, 4]). More generally,\nthe base points of rational maps betweeen higher dimensional varieties may be\nnon-reduced schemes of points, and in the case of maps between certain surfaces,\nthe regularity of the ideals that arise may have implications for the implicitization\nproblem in computer-aided design (cf. [8, 26]).\nIt is well known that the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity of a finitely generated\nZ-graded module M can be defined either in terms of degree bounds for the generators of the syzygy modules of M or in terms of the vanishing of graded pieces\nof local cohomology modules. (See [12].)

(See also\n[20].) We extend this notion to the more general case in which M is a finitely\ngenerated multigraded module over the Zk -graded homogeneous coordinate ring of\nPn1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Pnk by assigning to M a resolution regularity vector r(M ) \u2208 Nk (Definition 2.1) which gives bounds on the degrees of the generators of the multigraded\nsyzygy modules of M.\nBy contrast, Maclagan and Smith [19] use the local cohomology definition of\nregularity as their starting point in defining multigraded regularity for toric varieties. Since Pn1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Pnk is a toric variety, their definition specializes to a\ni\nversion of multigraded regularity given in terms of the vanishing of HB\n(M )p , the\nk\ndegree p \u2208 N part of the ith local cohomology module of M , where B is the\nirrelevant ideal of the homogeneous coordinate ring of Pn1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Pnk . In this context, the multigraded regularity, which we will denote by regB (M ), is a subset of\nk\nZ\nof M lie outside the set\nS . It can be shown that the degrees of the generators\nk\n(e\n+\nreg\n(M\n)),\nand\nif\nM\nis\nactually\nN\n-graded\nthen the degrees of the\nB\n1\u2264i\u2264k i\nk\ngenerators must lie in N .\nS\nIf k \u2265 2, the complement of 1\u2264i\u2264k (ei + regB (M )) in Nk may be unbounded;\nwe thus lose a useful feature of regularity in the standard graded case. However,\nwhen k = 2, Hoffman and Wang [18] introduced a notion of strong regularity\n(their definition of weak regularity essentially agrees with [19]) which requires the\nvanishing of graded pieces of additional local cohomology modules and gives a\nbounded subset of N2 that contains the degrees of the generators of M. It would\nbe interesting to develop a notion of strong regularity for other multigraded rings.\nSince the completion of this paper, the authors, together with Wang, have developed\na way of thinking about multigraded regularity via Z-graded coarsenings of Zr gradings. (See [21] for details.)\nWe now give an outline of the paper and describe our results. In \u00a71 we briefly\nintroduce multigraded regularity as defined in [19]. We also recall basic notions\nrelated to fat point schemes in Pn1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Pnk and show that the degree of a\nfat point scheme can be computed directly from the multiplicities of the points in\nProposition 1.7.\nIn \u00a72, Proposition 2.2 shows how r(M ) can be used to find a large subset of\nregB (M ). We also extend the work of [20] to show how to use an almost regular\nsequence to compute r(M ) if M is generated in degree 0 in Theorem 2.7. We study\nthe connections between r(M ) and the Z-regularity of modules associated to the\nfactors of Pn1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Pnk in \u00a73.\nIn \u00a74 and \u00a75, we study regB (R/IZ ) when R/IZ is the coordinate ring of a fat point\nscheme Z in Pn1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Pnk . Theorem 4.2 shows that r(R/IZ ) = (r1 , . . . , rk ) where\nri = reg(\u03c0i (Z)) \u2286 Pni . Furthermore, we show that r(R/IZ ) + Nk \u2286 regB (R/IZ )\nin Proposition 4.4, which improves on bounds that follow from Proposition 2.2.\nMoreover, if Z \u2286 Pn1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Pnk is also arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay, we show\nthat we have equality of sets: r(R/IZ ) + Nk = regB (R/IZ ) (Theorem 4.7). In \u00a75,\nwe restrict our attention to fat points Z = m1 P1 + * * * + ms Ps in P1 \u00d7 P1 with\nsupport in generic position and combine results of [10] and [14] to show that\n{(i, j) \u2208 N2 | (i, j) \u2265 (m1 \u2212 1, m1 \u2212 1) and i + j \u2265 max{m \u2212 1, 2m1 \u2212 2}} \u2286 regB (Z).\n\n\fMULTIGRADED REGULARITY: SYZYGIES AND FAT POINTS\n\nwhere m =\n\nP\n\n3\n\nmi and m1 \u2265 m2 \u2265 * * * \u2265 ms (Theorem 5.1).\n\nAt the end of the paper we have included an appendix containing some modified\nversions of results found in [19].\nAcknowledgments.

The homogeneous coordinate ring of Pn1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Pnk . Let k be an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero. Let N denote the natural numbers\n0, 1, . . . . The coordinate ring of Pn1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Pnk is the multigraded polynomial\n= ei , the ith standard\nring R = k[x1,0 , . . . , x1,n1 , . . . , xk,0 , . . . , xk,nk ] where deg xi,j L\nbasis vector of Zk . Because R is an Nk -graded ring, R =\ni\u2208Nk Ri and Ri is a\nfinite dimensional vector space over k\u0001with a\u0001 basis consisting\nof all monomials of\n\u0001\nnk +ik\nn2 +i2\n1\n*\n*\n*\n,\nwhere\ni = (i1 , . . . , ik ).\nmultidegree i. Thus, dimk Ri = n1n+i\nnk\nn2\n1\n\nNote that R is the homogeneous coordinate ring of Pn1 \u00d7* * *\u00d7Pnk viewed as a toric\nvariety of dimension N := n1 +* * *+nk . (See [7] for a comprehensive introduction to\nthis point of view.) The homogeneous coordinate ring of a toric variety is modeled\nafter the homogeneous coordinate ring of Pn . The space Pn1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Pnk is the\nTk\nquotient of AN +k \u2212 V (B), where B = i=1 hxi,j | j = 0, . . . , ni i is its square-free\nmonomial \"irrelevant\" ideal. Note that if k = 1, then B is just the irrelevant\nmaximal ideal of the coordinate ring of projective space.\nThe Nk -homogeneous ideals of R define subschemes of Pn1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Pnk . As in the\nstandard graded case, the notion of saturation plays an important role.\nDefinition 1.1. Let I \u2286 R be an Nk -homogeneous ideal. The saturation of I with\nrespect to B is sat(I) = {f \u2208 R | f B j \u2286 I, j \u226b 0}.\nTwo homogeneous ideals define the same subscheme of Pn1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Pnk if and only\nif their saturations with respect to the irrelevant ideal are equal. (See Corollary 3.8\nin [7].)\n\n1.2. Multigraded modules and regularity.\nL We shall work throughout with\nfinitely generated Zk -graded R-modules M = t\u2208Zk Mt . Without loss of generality,\nwe may restrict our attention to Nk -graded modules, since the t \u2208 Zk with Mt 6= 0\nmust be contained in p + Nk for some p \u2208 Zk if M is finitely generated. Write\np = p+ \u2212 p\u2212 where p+ , p\u2212 \u2208 Nk . Shifting degrees by \u2212p\u2212 yields a finitely generated\nNk -graded module.\nWhen M is a finitely generated Nk -graded R-module, it is useful to view M as\nboth an N1 -graded module and an Nk -graded module. We introduce some notation\nand conventions for translating between the Nk and N1 gradings of a module. Let\n\n\f4\n\nJESSICA SIDMAN AND ADAM VAN TUYL\n\na = (a1 , . . . , ak ) \u2208 Nk , and let 1 = (1, . . . , 1). If m \u2208 M has multidegree a \u2208 Nk ,\ndefine its N1 -degree to be a * 1.\nWe will use HM to denote the multigraded Hilbert function HM (t) := dimk Mt ,\n1\nand HL\nM to denote the N -graded Hilbert function HM (t) := dimk Mt . Because\nMt = t1 +***+tk =t M(t1 ,...,tk ) , we have the identity\nX\nHM (t) =\nHM (t1 , . . . , tk )\nfor all t \u2208 N.\nt1 +***+tk =t\n\nIf IY is the B\u2212saturated ideal defining a subscheme Y \u2286 Pn1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Pnk , then we\nsometimes write HY (resp. HY ) for HR/IY (resp. HR/IY ).\nWe use the notion of multigraded regularity developed in [19]. To discuss this\nnotion of regularity, we require a preliminary definition.\nDefinition 1.2. Let i \u2208 Z and set\n[\nNk [i] := (sign(i)p + Nk ) \u2282 Zk\n\nwhere the union is over all p \u2208 Nk whose coordinates sum to |i|. (In the notation\nof [19], \u00a74, we have taken C to be the set of standard basis vectors of Zk .)\nNote that Nk [i] may not be contained in Nk . The generality of Definition 1.2 is\nnecessary because Nk [i] will be used to describe the degrees in which certain local\ncohomology modules of Nk -graded modules vanish, and these local cohomology\nmodules may be nonzero in degrees with negative coordinates.\nDefinition 1.3 (Definition 4.1 in [19]). Let M be a finitely generated Nk -graded\ni\nR-module. If m \u2208 Zk , we say that M is m-regular if HB\n(M )p = 0 for all p \u2208\nk\nm + N [1 \u2212 i] for all i \u2265 0. The multigraded regularity of M, denoted regB (M ), is\nthe set of all m for which M is m-regular.\nWhen M = R/IY , the Nk -graded coordinate ring associated to a scheme Y \u2286\nP \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Pnk , we shall write regB (Y ) to denote regB (R/IY ).\nn1\n\nIf k = 1 and M 6= 0, then regB (M ) is a subset of N1 , and there exists some\nr \u2208 N1 such that regB (M ) = {i | i \u2265 r}. In this case, we will simply write\nreg(M ) = regB (M ) = r. Note that reg(M ) is the standard Castelnuovo-Mumford\nregularity. When k = 2, Definition 1.3 is essentially the same as the notion of weak\nregularity (Definition 3.1 in [18]) of Hoffman and Wang.\nRemark 1.4. As one might expect, regB (R) = Nk . Indeed, it follows from Example\n6.5 in [19] that it is enough to show the corresponding fact for a notion of multigraded regularity for the sheaf OPn1 \u00d7***\u00d7Pnk . This can be done using the K\u00fcnneth\nformula generalizing the proof for the case k = 2 in Proposition 2.5 of [18]. A\ntopological approach is given in Proposition 6.10 of [19]. For a related result see\nProposition 4.3 in [18].\nIt will also be useful to have the following weaker condition of multigraded regularity from level l:\nDefinition 1.5 (Definition 4.5 in [19]). Given l \u2208 N, the module M is m-regular\ni\nfrom level l if HB\n(M )p = 0 for all i \u2265 l and all p \u2208 m + Nk [1 \u2212 i]. The set of all m\nsuch that M is m-regular from level l is denoted reglB (M ).\n\n\fMULTIGRADED REGULARITY: SYZYGIES AND FAT POINTS\n\n5\n\nNote that reglB (M ) \u2287 regB (M ) for any finitely generated multigraded R-module\nM. However, even when M = R, the inequality may be strict.\nExample 1.6. Let R be the homogeneous coordinate ring of P2 \u00d7 P2 . We will\nshow that (\u22121, 0) \u2208 reg4B (R). By Definition 1.5 we only need to check vanishings\ni\nof graded pieces of HB\n(R) for i \u2265 4 which is equivalent to checking vanishings of\ni 2\n2\n2\n2\nH (P \u00d7 P , OP \u00d7P (a, b)) for i \u2265 3. (See \u00a76 in [19].) We let H i (OP2 \u00d7P2 (a, b)) denote\nH i (P2 \u00d7 P2 , OP2 \u00d7P2 (a, b)) and H i (OP2 (a)) denote H i (P2 , OP2 (a)). By the K\u00fcnneth\nformula, H 3 (OP2 \u00d7P2 (a, b)) is the direct sum\nM\nH i (OP2 (a)) \u2297 H j (OP2 (b)).\ni+j=3, i,j\u22650\n\nSince\nH 1 (OP2 (d)) = H 3 (OP2 (d)) = 0\nfor all integers d, each of the terms in the direct sum has a factor that is zero.\nSimilarly, if we compute H 4 (OP2 \u00d7P2 (a, b)) using the K\u00fcnneth formula, the only\npossible nonzero contribution to the direct sum comes from H 2 (OP2 (a))\u2297H 2 (OP2 (b)),\nwhich is nonzero if and only if both a, b \u2264 \u22123. However, the vanishing conditions\nneeded for (\u22121, 0) to be in reg4B (R) only require vanishing of H 4 (OP2 \u00d7P2 (a, b)) for\n(a, b) \u2265 (\u22125, 0), (\u22124, \u22121), (\u22123, \u22122), (\u22122, \u22123), (\u22121, \u22124).\nAll of the cohomology groups H i (OP2 \u00d7P2 (a, b)) vanish for i \u2265 5 since\nM\nH j1 (OP2 (a)) \u2297 H j2 (OP2 (b))\nH i (OP2 \u00d7P2 (a, b)) =\nj1 +j2 =i\n\nand i \u2265 5 implies that at least one of j1 and j2 is at least 3. Therefore, (\u22121, 0) \u2208\nreg4B (R) ) regB (R).\n1.3. Hilbert functions of points. We recall some facts about points in multiprojective spaces. If P \u2208 Pn1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Pnk is a point, then the ideal IP \u2286 R\nassociated to P is the prime ideal IP = hL1,1 , . . . , L1,n1 , . . . , Lk,1 , . . . , Lk,nk i with\ndeg Li,j = ei . Let X = {P1 , . . . , Ps } be a set of distinct points in Pn1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Pnk ,\nand let m1 , . . . , ms be positive integers. Set IZ = IPm11 \u2229 * * * \u2229 IPmss where IPi \u2194 Pi .\nThen IZ defines the scheme of fat points Z = m1 P1 + * * * + ms Ps \u2286 Pn1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Pnk .\nThe degree of Z is its length as a 0-dimensional subscheme of Pn1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Pnk .\nProposition 1.7.

The ideal IZ is a B-saturated ideal defining a finite length subscheme of\nPn1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Pnk . We will compute the degree of Z by computing the lengths of the\nstalks of the structure sheaf of Z at each of the points Pi .\nThe stalk of OPn1 \u00d7***\u00d7Pnk at a point Pi is a local ring isomorphic to O =\nk[x1 , . . . , xN ]hx1 ,...,xN i where the xi are indeterminates and hx1 , . . . , xN i is a maximal ideal.

In the multigraded\ngeneralization, we will employ the use of hypersurfaces of each multidegree ei .\nAlgebraically, we need the following lemma, which generalizes the reduced case of\nLemma 3.3 in [24].\nLemma 1.8. If IZ is the defining ideal of Z, a set of fat points in Pn1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Pnk ,\nthen, for each i = 1, . . . , k, there exists an L \u2208 Rei that is a nonzerodivisor on\nR/IZ .\nProof. We will show only the case i = 1. Since the primary decomposition of\nIZ is IZ = IPm11 \u2229 * * * \u2229 IPmss , the set of zerodivisors of R/IZ , consists of the set\ns\n[\nSs\n(IPi )e1 ( Re1 . It is clear that (IPi )e1 ( Re1 for\n.\nIt\nwill\nsuffice\nto\nshow\nI\ni=1 Pi\ni=1\n\neach i = 1, . . . , s. Because the field k is infinite, the vector\nSs space Re1 cannot be\n\u0003\nexpressed as a finite union of vector spaces, and hence, i=1 (IPi )ei ( Re1 .\n\nUsing Lemma 1.8 we can describe rules governing the behavior of the multigraded\nHilbert function of a set of fat points.\n\nProposition 1.9. Let Z be a set of fat points of Pn1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Pnk with Hilbert\nfunction HZ . Then\n(i) for all i \u2208 Nk and all 1 \u2264 j \u2264 k, HZ (i) \u2264 HZ (i + ej ).\n(ii) if HZ (i) = HZ (i + ej ), then HZ (i + ej ) = HZ (i + 2ej ).\n(iii) HZ (i) \u2264 deg(Z) for all i \u2208 Nk .\nProof. To prove (i) and (ii) use the nonzerodivisors of Lemma 1.8 to extend the\nproofs of Proposition 1.3 in [14] for fat points in P1 \u00d7 P1 to Pn1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Pnk . For\n(iii), if Z = m1 P1 + * * * + ms Ps , then deg(Z) is an upper bound on the number\nof linear conditions imposed on the forms that pass through the points P1 , . . . , Ps\nwith multiplicity at least mi at each point Pi .\n\u0003\nIf IZ defines a set of fat points in Pn1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Pnk , then the computation of\nregB (Z), as defined by Definition 1.3, depends only upon knowing HZ . Indeed\nTheorem 1.10 (Proposition 6.7 in [19]). Let Z be a set of fat points in Pn1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7\nPnk . Then i \u2208 regB (Z) if and only if HZ (i) = deg(Z).\nRemark 1.11. The set of reduced points Z = P1 + P2 + * * * + Ps is said to be in\ngeneric position if HZ (i) = min{dimk Ri , s} for all i \u2208 Nk . Hence, if Z is in generic\nposition, regB (Z) = {i | dimk Ri \u2265 s}.\n2. Regularity and syzygies\nIn the N1 -graded case, the definition of regularity can be formulated in terms\nof the degrees that appear as generators in the minimal free graded resolution of\nM. In this section we discuss a multigraded version of this definition extending the\nbigraded generalization that was given in [1] and studied further in [20].\nWe define a multigraded version of the notions of x- and y-regularity from [1].\n\n\fMULTIGRADED REGULARITY: SYZYGIES AND FAT POINTS\n\n7\n\nDefinition 2.1. Let\nrl := max{al | TorR\ni (M, k)(a1 ,...,al +i,...,ak ) 6= 0}\nfor some i and for some a1 , . . . , al\u22121 , al+1 , . . . , ak . We will call r(M ) := (r1 , . . . , rk )\nthe resolution regularity vector of M.\nNote that if r(M ) = (r1 , . . . , rk ) is the resolution regularity vector of a module\nM, then the multidegrees appearing at the ith stage in the minimal graded free\nresolution of M have lth coordinate bounded above by rl + i. Indeed,\nR(\u2212b1 , . . . , \u2212bk )(a1 ,...,al +i,...,ak ) 6= 0\nexactly when\n(a1 \u2212 b1 , . . . , al + i \u2212 bl , . . . , ak \u2212 bk )\nhas nonnegative coordinates, and\nTorR\ni (M, k)(a1 ,...,al +i,...,ak ) 6= 0\nwhen R(\u2212a1 , . . . , \u2212al\u22121 , \u2212al \u2212 i, \u2212al+1 , . . . , \u2212ak ) appears as a summand of the\nmodule at the ith stage in the resolution.\nThe resolution regularity vector of a module allows us to compute a lower bound\non the multigraded regularity of a module.\nProposition 2.2. Let M be a finitely generated Nk -graded R-module with resolution regularity vector r(M ) = (r1 , . . . , rk ). If p \u2208 r(M ) + Nk , then\n[\np + m * 1 \u2212 a + Nk \u2286 regB (M )\na\u2208Nk ,a*1=m\u22121\n\nwhere m = min{N + 1, proj- dim M }. Note that this set equals\np + m * 1 + Nk [\u2212(m \u2212 1)]\nif m > 0.\nProof. Let E. be the minimal free multigraded resolution of M where Ei =\n\nL\n\nR(\u2212qij )\n\nwith q ij \u2208 Nk and q ij \u2264 p + i * 1 for i = 0, . . . , proj- dim M. Therefore, by Remark\n1.4 we have the following bound on the multigraded regularity of Ei ,\n\\\nregB (Ei ) \u2287 (q ij + Nk ) \u2287 p + i * 1 + Nk .\nIf proj- dim M = 0, then it is immediate that p + Nk \u2286 regB (M ). So assume\nproj- dim M > 0. Let K0 be the syzygy module of M . So we have a short exact\nsequence\n0 \u2192 K0 \u2192 E0 \u2192 M \u2192 0.\nBy Lemma A.1 we then have\n\\\n(\u2212ej + reg1B (K0 )) \u2229 reg0B (E0 ) \u2286 reg0B (M ) = regB (M ).\n1\u2264j\u2264k\n\nSince reg1B (K0 ) \u2286 (\u2212ej + reg1B (K0 )) for each j, we have\nreg1B (K0 ) \u2229 (p + Nk ) \u2286\n\u2286\n\nreg1B (K0 ) \u2229 reg0B (E0 )\n\\\n(\u2212ej + reg1 (K0 )) \u2229 reg0B (E0 ) \u2286 regB (M ).\n\n1\u2264j\u2264k\n\n\f8\n\nJESSICA SIDMAN AND ADAM VAN TUYL\n\nApplying the revised Corollary 7.3 of [19] (see Theorem A.2) implies that\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\\\n[\n\uf8ed\n\u2212e\u03c6(2) \u2212 * * * \u2212 e\u03c6(i) + regi (Ei )\uf8f8 \u2286 reg1B (K0 )\n(1)\n1\u2264i\u2264m\n\n\u03c6:[m]\u2192[k]\n\nfrom which we deduce that\n\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\n\\\n[\n\uf8ed\n\u2212e\u03c6(2) \u2212 * * * \u2212 e\u03c6(i) + p + i * 1 + Nk \uf8f8 \u2286 reg1B (K0 ).\n(2)\n\u03c6:[m]\u2192[k]\n\n1\u2264i\u2264m\n\nHere we are using the fact that regB (Ei ) is contained in reglB (Ei ) for all l \u2265 0.\nSuppose that \u03c6 : [m] \u2192 [k].

Indeed, if the maximum value of the jth coordinate\noccurs for some i < m, then consider \u2212e\u03c6(2) \u2212 * * * \u2212 e\u03c6(i) \u2212 e\u03c6(i+1) + p + (i + 1) * 1.\nSince the difference\n\u2212e\u03c6(2) \u2212 * * * \u2212 e\u03c6(i) \u2212 e\u03c6(i+1) + p + (i + 1) * 1 \u2212 (\u2212e\u03c6(2) \u2212 * * * \u2212 e\u03c6(i) + p + i * 1)\nis \u2212e\u03c6(i+1) + 1, we see that if \u03c6(i + 1) = j, then the two vectors are equal in the\njth coordinate. Otherwise, the vector \u2212e\u03c6(2) \u2212 * * * \u2212 e\u03c6(i) \u2212 e\u03c6(i+1) + p + (i + 1) * 1\nhas a bigger jth coordinate. So we see that the maximum value of each of the\ncoordinates must occur when i = m (and possibly earlier as well).\nP\nTherefore, the intersection in (3) is equal to p + m * 1 \u2212 m\n+ Nk . As \u03c6\ni=2 e\u03c6(i)P\nm\nvaries over all possible functions from [m] to [k], the set of all vectors i=2 e\u03c6(i) is\nk\njust the set of all a \u2208 N such that a * 1 = m \u2212 1.\n(2) is just\n[\n\np + m * 1 \u2212 a + Nk .\n\na\u2208Nk ,a*1=m\u22121\n\nis also a subset of (p + Nk ) we have\n[\np + m * 1 \u2212 a + Nk \u2286 reg1B (K0 ) \u2229 (p + Nk ) \u2286 regB (M )\na\u2208Nk ,a*1=m\u22121\n\nas desired.\n\n\u0003\n\nThe N1 -graded regularity of a multigraded module M also gives the following\nrough bound on regB (M ).\nCorollary 2.3. Let M be a finitely generated Nk -graded R module. If reg(M ) \u2264 r,\nthen\n[\n(r + m) * 1 \u2212 a + Nk\nregB (M ) \u2287\na*1=m\u22121\n\nwhere m = min{N + 1, proj- dim M }.\n\n\fMULTIGRADED REGULARITY: SYZYGIES AND FAT POINTS\n\n9\n\nProof. Let E. be the minimal free multigraded resolution\nLof M. Since reg(M ) \u2264 kr,\nwe know that reg(Ei ) \u2264 r + i for all i \u2265 0. Since Ei =\nR(\u2212qij ) with q ij \u2208 N ,\nthis means q ij * 1 \u2264 r + i. Therefore, the resolution regularity vector r(M ) \u2264 r * 1.\nThe result now follows from Proposition 2.2.\n\u0003\nRemark 2.4. Note that if k = 1 Proposition 2.2 is equivalent to the statement that\nif an N1 -graded module is p-regular, then it is also q-regular for all q \u2208 p + N1 .\nWhen k > 1, Proposition 2.2 may not give all of regB (M ). Indeed, Theorem\n7.2 of [19] will not give all of regB (M ) even using more detailed information about\nmultidegrees in a resolution than given by r(M ). (See Example 7.6 in [19].)\nRemark 2.5. Let M be a finitely generated Nk -graded R-module with resolution\nregularity vector r(M ). Under extra hypotheses on M , the bound of Proposition\n2.2 can be improved to regB (M ) \u2287 r(M ) + Nk . For example, in Proposition 4.4 we\nwill show that r(M ) + Nk \u2286 regB (M ) if M = R/IZ is the coordinate ring of a set\nof fat points in Pn1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Pnk .\nIt seems, therefore, natural to ask the following question:\nQuestion 2.6. Let M be a finitely generated Nk -graded R-module with resolution\nregularity vector r(M ). What extra conditions on M imply regB (M ) \u2287 r(M ) + Nk ?\n(Since the submission of this paper, H\u00e0 has given an example showing that this\ninclusion may not hold, as well as other related results in [15].)\nAs we have observed, the resolution regularity vector of the Nk -graded R module\nM gives us partial information about regB (M ). We close this section by describing\nhow to compute the resolution regularity vector for some classes of M . This procedure is a natural extension of the bigraded case as given by [20], which itself was\na generalization of the graded case [2].\n[l]\n\nIf M is any finitely generated Nk -graded R module, then we shall use Ma to\ndenote the Nk\u22121 -graded module\nM\nM(j1 ,...,jl\u22121 ,a,jl+1 ,...,jk ) .\nMa[l] :=\n(j1 ,...,jl\u22121 ,jl+1 ,...,jk )\n\n[l]\n\nObserve that Ma is a k[x1,0 , . . . , x\u0302l,0 , . . . , x\u0302l,nl , . . . , xk,nk ]-module, where \u02c6 means\nthe element is omitted.\nAn element x \u2208 Rel is a multigraded almost regular element for M if\nh0 :M xi[l]\na = 0 for a \u226b 0.\nA sequence x1 , . . . , xt \u2208 Rel is a multigraded almost regular sequence if for i =\n1, . . . , t, xi is a multigraded almost regular element for M/hx1 , . . . , xi\u22121 iM . A\nmultigraded almost regular element need not be almost regular in the usual sense,\n[1]\neven for bigraded rings since we may have h0 :M xia = 0 for a \u2265 a0 , but h0 :M\nxi(a0 \u22121,j) 6= 0 for infinitely many j. (Note that in the single graded case, almost\nregular elements were studied in [22] under the name of filter regular elements.)\nNow suppose that for each l = 1, . . . , k we have a basis yl,0 , . . . , yl,nl of Rel that\nforms a multigraded almost regular sequence for M . Because k is infinite, it is\n\n\f10\n\nJESSICA SIDMAN AND ADAM VAN TUYL\n\nalways possible to find such a basis; one can derive a proof of this fact by adapting\nthe proof of Lemma 2.1 of [20] for the bigraded case to the multigraded case. Set\no\nn\n[l]\nsl,j := max a\n0 :M/hyl,0 ,...,yl,j\u22121 iM yl,j a 6= 0 ,\nand sl := max{sl,0 , . . . , sl,nl }. Theorem 2.2 in [20] then extends to the Nk -graded\ncase as follows:\nTheorem 2.7. Let M be a finitely generated multigraded R-module generated in\ndegree 0, for for l = 1, . . . , k, let yl,0 , . . . , yl,nl be a basis Rel that forms a multigraded almost regular sequence for M . Then r(M ) = (s1 , . . . , sk ).\n3. Resolution regularity and projections of varieties\nIt is natural to ask if the N1 -regularity of the projections of a subscheme V of\nP \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Pnk onto the factors Pni are related in a nice way to the coordinates\nappearing in the resolution regularity vector of R/IV . We show in Theorem 4.2\nthat if V is a set of fat points, then the ith coordinate in the resolution regularity\nvector of R/IV is precisely the N1 -regularity of the projection of V to Pni . However,\nExample 3.1 below shows that in general no such relationship can hold for arbitrary\nsubschemes of Pn1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Pnk .\nn1\n\nExample 3.1. Let R = k[x0 , x1 , x2 , y0 , y1 , y2 ], and let\nI = hx0 , x1 i \u2229 hx0 \u2212 x1 , x2 i \u2229 hy0 , y1 i \u2229 hy0 \u2212 y1 , y2 i\nbe the defining ideal of a union of 4 planes in P2 \u00d7 P2 . The vector r(R/I) must\nbe strictly positive in both coordinates since I has a minimal generator of bidegree\n(2, 2). However, the projection of the scheme onto either factor of P2 is surjective.\nTherefore, the regularity of the projections of the scheme defined by I is zero.\nWe consider some circumstances where the resolution regularity vector of a\nmodule M is given by the regularities of modules associated to the factors of\nPn1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Pnk . We have the following proposition which generalizes Lemma 6.2 in\n[20].\nProposition 3.2. Let Ri = k[xi,0 , . . . , xi,ni ] and let Mi 6= 0 be an N1 -graded Ri module. The ith coordinate of the resolution regularity vector of M1 \u2297k * * * \u2297k Mk\nis reg(Mi ).\nProof. The proof proceeds as in the case k = 2 in [20]. The point is that the\ntensor product (over k) of minimal free graded resolutions of the modules Mi is\nthe minimal free multigraded resolution of M1 \u2297k * * * \u2297k Mk . We can read off the\nresolution regularity vector from the multidegrees appearing in this resolution. \u0003\nWe have the following corollary.\nCorollary 3.3. Let Ii be a proper homogeneous ideal in Ri , the coordinate ring of\nPni . Set I := I1 + * * * + Ik \u2282 R. Then the ith coordinate of the resolution regularity\nvector of R/I is reg(Ri /Ii ).\nProof. Let Mi = Ri /Ii and apply Proposition 3.2.\n\n\u0003\n\n\fMULTIGRADED REGULARITY: SYZYGIES AND FAT POINTS\n\n11\n\nThe R-modules M that are products of modules over the factors of Pn1 \u00d7* * *\u00d7Pnk\nhave the property that they are r(M ) * 1-regular as N1 -graded modules.\nCorollary 3.4. Suppose that MP= M1 \u2297k * * * \u2297k Mk as in Proposition 3.2 and\nr(M ) = (r1 , . . . , rk ). Then M is\nri -regular as an N1 -graded module.\nProof. Construct a resolution of M by tensoring together minimal free graded resolutions of the Mi s. The free module at thePjth stage in the resolution is a direct\nli = j and Fi,li is the module at the\nsum of modules F1,l1 \u2297k * * * \u2297k Fk,lk where\nli th stage in the minimal free graded resolution of Mi over the ring Ri defined as in\nof degree \u2264 rP\nProposition 3.2. Since Fi,li is generated by elementsP\ni + li , the total\n\u0003\ndegree of any generator of Fi,l1 \u2297k * * * \u2297k Fk,lk is \u2264 (ri + li ) = ( ri ) + j.\nCorollary 3.4 is not true for resolution regularity vectors of arbitrary modules.\nFor example, let R = k[x0 , x1 , y0 , y1 ] and let I = hx0 y1 , x1 y0 i. (The saturation of I\nwith respect to B is the defining ideal of two points in P1 \u00d7 P1 .) The resolution of\nthe ideal I is given by the Koszul complex\n0 \u2192 R(\u22122, \u22122) \u2192 R2 (\u22121, \u22121) \u2192 hx0 y1 , x1 y0 i \u2192 0.\nSo r(I) = (1, 1), but the ideal I is not 2-regular as an N1 -graded ideal.\n4. Multigraded regularity for points\nLet Z = m1 P1 + * * * + ms Ps \u2286 Pn1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Pnk be a scheme of fat points, and\nlet Zi = \u03c0i (Z) denote the projection of Z into Pni by the ith projection morphism\n\u03c0i : Pn1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Pnk \u2192 Pni . We show how the resolution regularity vector of R/IZ\nis related to reg(Zi ), the regularity of Zi as a subscheme of Pni for i = 1, . . . , k.\nWe then improve upon Proposition 2.2 and show r(R/IZ ) + Nk \u2286 regB (Z). As\na corollary, rough estimates of regB (Z) are obtained for any set of fat points by\nemploying well known bounds for fat points in Pn . We also show that if Z is ACM,\nregB (Z) is in fact determined by reg(Zi ) for i = 1, . . . , k.\nLemma 4.1. Let Z = m1 P1 + * * * + ms Ps \u2286 Pn1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Pnk . Let the ith coordinate\nof the jth point be Pji so that the ideal IPj defining the point Pj is the sum of ideals\nIPj1 + * * * + IPjk where IPji defines the ith coordinate of Pj .

We shall use Theorem 2.7 to compute the resolution regularity vector. Because k is infinite, for each l there exists a basis yl,0 , . . . , yl,nl for Rel that is a\nmultigraded almost regular sequence. Furthermore, by Lemma 1.8 we can also\nassume that yl,0 is a nonzerodivisor on R/IZ .\nSince yl,0 is a nonzerodivisor, h0 :R/IZ yl,0 i = 0, which implies that sl,0 \u2264 0. We\nnow need to calculate sl,i for i = 1, . . . , nl .\nBecause yl,0 is a nonzerodivisor on R/IZ , we have the short exact sequence\n\u00d7yl,0\n\n0 \u2192 R/IZ (\u2212el ) \u2192 R/IZ \u2192 R/hIZ , yl,0 i \u2192 0.\n\n(4)\n\nSince rl = reg(Zl ), the sequence (4) and Lemma 4.1 give\nHR/hIZ ,yl,0 i ((rl + 1)el ) =\n=\n\nHZ ((rl + 1)el ) \u2212 HZ (rl el )\nHZl (rl + 1) \u2212 HZl (rl ) = deg Zl \u2212 deg Zl = 0.\n\nThus hIZ , yl,0 iael = Rael if a \u2265 rl + 1. Hence for any j \u2265 (rl + 1)el , Rj =\nhIZ , yl,0 ij \u2286 hIZ , yl,0 , . . . , yl,i\u22121 ij .\nSince h0 :R/hIZ ,yl,0 ,...,yl,i\u22121 i yl,i i is an ideal of R/hIZ , yl,0 , . . . , yl,i\u22121 i, and because\nR/hIZ , yl,0 , . . . , yl,i\u22121 ij = 0, if j \u2265 (rl + 1)el ,\n(5)\n\n0 :R/hIZ ,yl,0 ,...,yl,i\u22121 i yl,i\n\n[l]\na\n\n= 0 if a \u2265 rl + 1.\n\nThus, from (5) we have sl,j \u2264 rl for each l and each j = 1, . . . , nl . Since sl,0 \u2264 0, it\nsuffices to show that sl,1 = rl since this gives sl = max{sl,0 , . . . , sl,nl } = sl,1 = rl .\nThe short exact sequence (4) also implies that\nHR/hIZ ,yl,0 i (rl el ) = HZl (rl ) \u2212 HZl (rl \u2212 1) > 0\nbecause HZl (rl \u2212 1) < HZl (rl ) = deg Zl . So there exists 0 6= F \u2208 (R/hIZ , yl,0 i)rl el .\nBecause deg F y l,1 = (rl + 1)el , and (R/hIZ , yl,0 i)(rl +1)el = 0, we must have F \u2208\n[l]\n\nh0 :R/hIZ ,yl,0 i yl,1 i. So, 0 6= F \u2208 h0 :R/hIZ ,yl,0 i yl,1 irl , thus implying sl,1 = rl .\n\n\u0003\n\nThe previous result, combined with Proposition 2.2, gives us a crude bound on\nregB (Z). However, we can improve upon this bound.\nLemma 4.3. Let P \u2208 Pn1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Pnk be a point with defining ideal IP \u2286 R, and\nm \u2208 N+ . Then regB (R/IPm ) = (m \u2212 1, . . . , m \u2212 1) + Nk .\nProof. After a change of coordinates, we can assume P = [1 : 0 : * * * : 0] \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 [1 :\n0 * * * : 0]. So IPm = hx1,1 , . . . , x1,n1 , . . . , xk,1 , . . . , xk,nk im .

Suppose Z \u2286 Pn1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Pnk is a set of fat points. Then\n(r1 , . . . , rk ) + Nk \u2286 regB (Z)\nwhere ri = reg(Zi ) for i = 1, . . . , k.\nProof. The proof is by induction on s, the number of points in the support. If\ns = 1, then the result follows from Lemma 4.3.\nSo, suppose s > 1 and let X = {P1 , . . . , Ps } be the support of Z. We can find\nan i \u2208 {1, . . . , k} such that 1 < |\u03c0i (X)|, i.e., there exists an i where the projection\nof X onto its ith coordinates consists of two or more points. Fix a P\u0303 \u2208 \u03c0i (X).\nWe can then write Z = Y1 \u222a Y2 where Y1 = {mj Pj \u2208 Z | \u03c0i (Pj ) = P\u0303 } and\nY2 = {mj Pj \u2208 Z | \u03c0i (Pj ) 6= P\u0303 }. By our choice of i, Y1 and Y2 are nonempty,\nY1 \u2229 Y2 = \u2205, and \u03c0i (Y1 ) \u2229 \u03c0i (Y2 ) = \u2205.\nLet IY1 , resp., IY2 , denote the defining ideal associated to Y1 , resp., Y2 . Consider\nthe short exact sequence\n0 \u2192 R/hIY1 \u2229 IY2 i \u2192 R/IY1 \u2295 R/IY2 \u2192 R/hIY1 + IY2 i \u2192 0.\nSince IZ = IY1 \u2229 IY2 , this exact sequence gives rise to the identity\n(6)\n\nHZ (t) = HY1 (t) + HY2 (t) \u2212 HR/hIY1 +IY2 i (t) for all t \u2208 Nk .\n\nSet Yj,1 := \u03c0j (Y1 ) and Yj,2 := \u03c0j (Y2 ) for each j = 1, . . . , k. Since Yj,1 \u2286 Zj and\nYj,2 \u2286 Zj , we have reg(Yj,1 ) \u2264 rj and reg(Yj,2 ) \u2264 rj . By induction and the above\nidentity we therefore have\nHZ (r1 , . . . , rk ) = deg Y1 + deg Y2 \u2212 HR/hIY1 +IY2 i (r1 , . . . , rk ).\nSince deg Z = deg Y1 + deg Y2 , it suffices to show HR/hIY1 +IY2 i (r1 , . . . , rk ) = 0.\nBy Lemma 4.1, HZ (ri ei ) = HZi (ri ) = deg Zi , HY1 (ri ei ) = HYi,1 (ri ) = deg Yi,1 ,\nand HY2 (ri ei ) = HYi,2 (ri ) = deg Yi,2 . But because Yi,1 \u2229 Yi,2 = \u2205 by our choice\nof i, deg Zi = deg Yi,1 + deg Yi,2 . Substituting into (6) with t = ri ei then gives\nHR/hIY1 +IY2 i (ri ei ) = 0, or equivalently, Rri ei = hIY1 + IY2 iri ei . It now follows that\n\u0003\nR(r1 ,...,rk ) = hIY1 + IY2 i(r1 ,...,rk ) which gives HR/hIY1 +IY2 i (r1 , . . . , rk ) = 0.\nUsing well known bounds for fat points in Pn thus gives us:\nCorollary 4.5. Let Z = m1 P1 + * * * + ms Ps \u2286 Pn1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Pnk with m1 \u2265 * * * \u2265 ms .\n(i) Set m = m1 + m2 + * * * + ms \u2212 1.

It follows from Davis and Geramita [9] that ri = reg(Zi ) \u2264 m for each i. So\n(m, . . . , m) + Nk \u2286 (r1 , . . . , rk ) + Nk , and hence (i) follows.\nFor (ii), because X is in generic position, the support of Zi is in generic position\nin Pni . In [5] it was shown that ri = reg(Zi ) \u2264 li for each i.\n\u0003\n\n\f14\n\nJESSICA SIDMAN AND ADAM VAN TUYL\n\nRecall that a scheme Y \u2286 Pn1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Pnk is arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay\n(ACM) if depth R/IY =K-dim R/IY . For any collection of fat points Z \u2286 Pn1 \u00d7* * *\u00d7\nPnk we always have K-dim R/IZ = k, the number of projective spaces.

See [25] for more details.\nA scheme of fat points, therefore, may or may not be ACM. When Z is ACM,\nregB (Z) depends only upon knowing reg(Zi ) for i = 1, . . . , k.\nLemma 4.6. Let Z be an ACM set of fat points in Pn1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Pnk . Then there\nexist elements Li \u2208 Rei such that L1 , . . . , Lk is a regular sequence on R/IZ .\nProof. The nontrivial part of the statement is the existence of a regular sequence\nwhose elements have the specified multidegrees. The proof given for the reduced\ncase (see Proposition 3.2 in [25]) can be adapted to the nonreduced case.\n\u0003\nTheorem 4.7. Let Z \u2286 Pn1 \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 Pnk be a set of fat points. If Z is ACM, then\n(r1 , . . . , rk ) + Nk = regB (Z)\nwhere ri = reg(Zi ) for i = 1, . . . , k.\nProof. Let L1 , . . . , Lk be the regular sequence from Lemma 4.6, and set J =\nhIZ , L1 , . . . , Lk i. We require the following claims.\nClaim 1. If j 6\u2264 (r1 , . . . , rk ), then HR/J (j) = 0.\nSince j 6\u2264 (r1 , . . . , rk ) there exists 1 \u2264 l \u2264 k such that jl > rl . Using the exact\nsequence (4) of Theorem 4.2, the claim follows if we replace yl,0 with Ll .\nClaim 2. For i = 1, . . . , k, HR/J (ri ei ) > 0.\nBy degree considerations, HR/J (ri ei ) = HR/hIZ ,Li i (ri ei ) for each i. Employing\nthe short exact sequence\n\u00d7L\n\n0 \u2192 R/IZ (\u2212ei ) \u2192i R/IZ \u2192 R/hIZ , Li i \u2192 0\nto calculate HR/hIZ ,Li i (ri ei ) gives HR/hIZ ,Li i (ri ei ) = HZ (ri ei ) \u2212 HZ ((ri \u2212 1)ei ) =\nHZi (ri ) \u2212 HZi (ri \u2212 1). The claim now follows since HZi (ri \u2212 1) < deg Zi = HZi (ri ).\nWe complete the proof. Since L1 , . . . , Lk is a regular sequence, we have the\nfollowing short exact sequences\n\u00d7L\n\n0 \u2192 R/hIZ , L1 , . . . , Li\u22121 i(\u2212ei ) \u2192i R/hIZ , L1 , . . . , Li\u22121 i \u2192 R/hIZ , L1 , . . . , Li i \u2192 0\nfor i = 1, . . . , k. It then follows that\nX\nHZ (j) =\nHR/J (i) for all j \u2208 Nk .\n0\u2264i\u2264j\n\nNow suppose that j 6\u2208 (r1 , . . . , rk ) + Nk . So jl < rl for some l.

This fact, coupled with Theorem\n4.4, gives the desired result.\n\u0003\nRemark 4.8. The converse of Theorem 4.7 is false because there exist fat point\nschemes Z such that regB (Z) = r(R/IZ ) + Nk , but Z is not ACM. For example, set\nPij := [1 : i] \u00d7 [1 : j] \u2208 P1 \u00d7 P1 , and consider Z = {P11 , P12 , P13 , P21 , P22 , P31 , P33 }.\nThen HZ is\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\n1 2 3 3 ...\n\uf8ef2 4 6 6 . . .\uf8fa\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef\n\uf8fa\n\uf8ef\nHZ = \uf8ef3 6 7 7 . . .\uf8fa .\n\uf8ef3 6 7 7 . . .\uf8fa\n\uf8fb\n\uf8f0\n.. .. .. .. . .\n.\n. . . .\nIt follows that regB (Z) = (2, 2) + N2 . However, the resolution of R/IZ has length\n3, so by the Auslander-Buchsbaum Theorem, depth R/IZ = depth R \u2212 pd R/IZ =\n4 \u2212 3 = 1 < 2 = K- dim R/IZ . Alternatively, R/IZ is not ACM since the first\ndifference function of HZ is not the Hilbert function of an N2 -graded Artinian\nquotient of k[x1 , y1 ]. (see Theorem 4.8 in [25]).\n\n5.

The ideal IPmii is a power of\ncomplete intersection. The resolution of IPmii is thus given by the Eagon-Northcott\nresolution.

If j \u2265 m1 \u2212 1 and i \u2265 m1 \u2212 1, then HZ (i, j) \u2264 deg Z.\nSince there are l + 1 pairs (i, j) \u2208 N2 such that i + j = l, and m1 \u2212 1 pairs fall into\nthe first case, and m1 \u2212 1 are in the second case, we must have l + 1 \u2212 2(m1 \u2212 1) =\nl + 1 \u2212 2m1 + 2 > 0 pairs in the third case because l \u2265 2m1 \u2212 2.\nWe thus have\nHZ (l) =\n\nX\n\nHZ (i, j) \u2264 2(c0 + * * * + cm1 \u22122 ) + (l + 1 \u2212 2m1 + 2) deg Z.\n\ni+j=l\n\nClaim. c0 + * * * + cm1 \u22122 =\n\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\ns \u0014\u0012\nX\nmi + 1\n2mi \u2212 2\ni=1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0015\nmi + 1\n+\n(m1 \u2212 mi ) .\n2\n\nProof of Claim.\nm\n1 \u22121\nX\n\ncj\n\n=\n\nj=0\n\n=\n=\n=\n\nm\ns\n1 \u22121 X\nX\n\n[mi + (mi \u2212 1)+ + * * * + (mi \u2212 j)+ ]\nj=0 i=1\n\u0012\ns \u0014\nX\nmi +\n2\n2\n2\n2\nmi + (mi \u2212 1) + * * * + 2 + 1 + (m1 \u2212 mi )\n2\ni=1\n\u0014\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\ns\nX\nmi (mi + 1)(2mi + 1)\nmi + 1\n+ (m1 \u2212 mi )\n6\n2\ni=1\n\u0014\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\ns\nX mi + 1\n2mi + 1\nmi + 1\n+ (m1 \u2212 mi )\n.\n2\n3\n2\ni=1\n\nPs\nBy subtracting cm1 \u22121 = i=1\narrive at the claimed result.\n\nmi +1\n2\n\n\u0001\n\n1\n\n\u0013\u0015\n\nfrom both sides of the above expression, we\n\n\f18\n\nJESSICA SIDMAN AND ADAM VAN TUYL\n\nWe complete the proof:\nX\nHZ (l) =\nHZ (i, j)\ni+j=l\ns \u0014\u0012\nX\n\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013\n\u0015\nmi + 1\n2mi \u2212 2\n+\n(m1 \u2212 mi )\n3\n2\ni=1\n\u0012\n\u0013\ns\nX mi + 1\n+(l + 1 \u2212 2m1 + 2)\n2\ni=1\n\u0014\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\ns\nX\nmi + 1\nmi + 1\n4mi \u2212 4\nl+\n=\n\u2212 2mi + 3\n2\n2\n3\ni=1\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\u0012\n\u0013\u0015\ns \u0014\u0012\nX\nmi + 1\nmi + 1\n\u22122mi + 5\nl+\n=\n= HZ (l).\n2\n2\n3\ni=1\n\u2264 2\n\nmi + 1\n2\n\n\u0013\u0012\n\nIf we view HZ as an infinite matrix, then because HZ strictly increases along each\nrow and column until it reaches its eventual growth value as given in Lemma 5.2, we\nmust have HZ (i, j) equal to this eventual growth value for all (i, j) with i + j = l.\nThat is, in all three cases, HZ (i, j) equals the given upper bound. In particular,\nHZ (i, j) = deg Z if i + j = l and i \u2265 m1 \u2212 1 and j \u2265 m1 \u2212 1.\n\u0003\nRemark 5.4. Note that we have in fact proved a stronger result. In conjunction with\nLemma 5.2, we can describe HZ (i, j) for all (i, j) with i + j \u2265 max{m \u2212 1, 2m1 \u2212 2}\ndirectly from the multiplicities of the points.\nAppendix A. Resolutions and B-regularity\nIn this section we prove some modified versions of results in \u00a77 of [19] for finitely\ngenerated Nk -graded R-modules with R = [x1,0 , . . . , x1,n1 , . . . , xk,0 , . . . , xk,nk ] where\ndeg xi,j = ei , the ith standard basis vector of Zk . Here, we use the notation of [19].\nLemma A.1 (Lemma 7.1 in [19]). Let 0 \u2192 M \u2032 \u2192 M \u2192 M \u2032\u2032 \u2192 0 be a short exact\nsequence of finitely generated Nk -graded R-modules. If i \u2265 1, then\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n[\n\uf8ed\n(\u2212ej + regi+1 (M \u2032 ))\uf8f8 \u2229 regi (M ) \u2286 regi (M \u2032\u2032 ).\n1\u2264j\u2264k\n\nOtherwise, when i = 0\n\\\n\n(\u2212ej + reg1 (M \u2032 )) \u2229 reg0 (M ) \u2286 reg0 (M \u2032\u2032 ).\n\n1\u2264j\u2264k\n\nProof. For the first statement, the proof proceeds as in [19]. The key inclusion is\nthat for any j, m + Nk [1 \u2212 t] \u2286 m + ej + Nk [\u2212t] for all t \u2265 1. However, the inclusion\nfails if t = 0.\nTurning to the second part of the claim, we let\n\\\nm\u2208\n(\u2212ej + reg1 (M \u2032 )) \u2229 reg0 (M ).\n1\u2264j\u2264k\n\nThe long exact sequence in cohomology gives\n0\n0\n1\n* * * \u2192 HB\n(M )p \u2192 HB\n(M \u2032\u2032 )p \u2192 HB\n(M \u2032 )p \u2192 * * *\n\n\fMULTIGRADED REGULARITY: SYZYGIES AND FAT POINTS\n\n19\n\n0\nWe know that the HB\n(M )p = 0 for all\n\np \u2208 m + Nk [1] =\n\nk\n[\n\nm + e j + Nk .\n\nj=1\n1\nWe will be done if we can show that HB\n(M \u2032 )p = 0 for all p \u2208 m + Nk [1] since the\nvanishings of the higher cohomology modules follow from the first (and stronger)\npart of the lemma.\n1\nWe know that HB\n(M \u2032 )p = 0 forTall p \u2208 reg1 (M \u2032 ). So, it is enough to show that\nk\n1\n\u2032\nm + N [1] \u2286 reg (M ). Since m \u2208 1\u2264j\u2264k (\u2212ej + reg1 (M \u2032 )), m + ej \u2208 reg1 (M \u2032 ) for\nevery j. That is, m + ej + Nk \u2286 reg1 (M ) for every j, and since\nk\n[\n\nm + ej + Nk = m + Nk [1],\n\nj=1\n\nand we are done.\n\n\u0003\n\nIn our situation, we have the following variant of Corollary 7.3 in [19].\nTheorem A.2. Let 0 \u2192 Er \u2192 * * * \u2192 E3 \u2192 E2 \u2192 E1 \u2192 E0 \u2192 0 be a\nfree Nk -graded resolution of a finitely generated Nk -graded R-module M. Let m =\nmin{r, N + 1}. We have\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\\\n[\n\uf8ed\n(\u2212e\u03c6(2) \u2212 * * * \u2212 e\u03c6(i) + regi (Ei ))\uf8f8 \u2286 reg1 (K0 )\n\u03c6:[m]\u2192[k]\n\n1\u2264i\u2264m\n\nwhere K0 is the first syzygy module of M and the union is over all functions \u03c6 :\n[m] \u2192 [k].\nThe result follows from the proof of Theorem 7.2 in [19] which is based upon the\nfirst conclusion of Lemma A.1 and descending induction on i.\nReferences\n[1] A.
