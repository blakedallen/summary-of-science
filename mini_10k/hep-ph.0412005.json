Namely, the particle yield ratios and pT spectra were fitted\naccurately with the use of only four parameters (for particle ratio fits two parameters are enough: the temperature T\nand the baryon number chemical potential \u03bcB ). Now, those parameters will be used to evaluate global observables:\nthe transverse energy density dET /d\u03b7, the charged particle multiplicity density dNch /d\u03b7 and their ratio (for details\nsee [15]). The advantage of such an approach is based on the fact that the transverse energy and charged particle multiplicity measurements are independent of hadron spectroscopy (in particular, no particle identification is necessary),\ntherefore they could be used as an additional test of the self-consistency of a statistical model.\nThe experimentally measured transverse energy is defined as\n\nET =\n\nL\nX\ni=1\n\n\u00cai * sin \u03b8i ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b8i is the polar angle, \u00cai denotes Ei \u2212 mN (mN means the nucleon mass) for baryons and the total energy Ei\nfor all other particles, and the sum is taken over all L emitted particles [16]. Additionally, in the case of RHIC at\n\u221a\nsN N = 200 GeV, Ei + mN is taken instead of Ei for antibaryons [17].\nThe statistical model with single freeze-out is used (for details see [12]). The model very well reproduces ratios and\npT spectra of particles measured at RHIC [8, 9, 10]. The main assumption of the model is the simultaneous occurrence\nof chemical and thermal freeze-outs, which means that the possible elastic interactions after the chemical freeze-out\nare neglected. The conditions for the freeze-out are expressed by values of two independent thermal parameters: T\nand \u03bcB . The strangeness chemical potential \u03bcS is determined from the requirement that the overall strangeness of\nthe gas equals zero.\nThe actually detected (stable) particles have two sources: (a) a thermal gas and (b) secondaries produced by decays\nand sequential decays of primordial resonances. The distributions of particles from source (a) are given by a BoseEinstein or a Fermi-Dirac distribution at the freeze-out point. The distributions of secondaries (source (b)) can be\nobtained from the elementary kinematics of a many-body decay or from the superposition of two or more such decays\n(for details see [12, 15]). In the following, all possible (2-, 3- and 4-body) decays with branching ratios not less than\n1% are considered. Also almost all cascades (with the exclusion of a very few like 4- or 5-step ones such that they\nproceed via at least one 3- or 4-body decay) are taken into account. It should be stressed that all contributions from\nweak decays are included in the presented analysis.\n\n\u2217 Presented\n\nat the XLIV Cracow School of Theoretical Physics, Zakopane, Poland, May 28-June 6, 2004\n\n\f2\nII.\n\nTHE FOUNDATIONS OF THE SINGLE-FREEZE-OUT MODEL\n\nThe foundations of the model are as follows: (a) the chemical and thermal freeze-outs take place simultaneously,\n(b) all confirmed resonances up to a mass of 2 GeV from the Particle Data Tables [18] are taken into account, (c) a\nfreeze-out hypersurface is defined by the equation\n\u03c4=\n\nq\nt2 \u2212 rx2 \u2212 ry2 \u2212 rz2 = const ,\n\n(2)\n\n(d ) the four-velocity of an element of the freeze-out hypersurface is proportional to its coordinate\nt \u0010 rx ry rz \u0011\nx\u03bc\n1, , ,\n,\n(3)\n=\n\u03c4\n\u03c4\nt t t\nq\n(e) the transverse size is restricted by the condition r = rx2 + ry2 < \u03c1max . In this way one has two additional\nparameters of the model, \u03c4 and \u03c1max , connected with the geometry of the freeze-out hypersurface.\nThe maximum transverse-flow parameter (or the surface velocity) is given by\nu\u03bc =\n\n\u03c1max /\u03c4\nmax\n= p\n\u03b2\u22a5\n.\n1 + (\u03c1max /\u03c4 )2\n\n(4)\n\nThe invariant distribution of the measured particles of species i has the form [9, 10]\ndNi\n=\nd2 pT dy\n\nZ\n\np\u03bc d\u03c3\u03bc fi (p * u) ,\n\n(5)\n\nwhere d\u03c3\u03bc is the normal vector on a freeze-out hypersurface, p * u = p\u03bc u\u03bc , u\u03bc is the four-velocity of a fluid element\nand fi is the final momentum distribution of the particle in question. The final distribution means here that fi is the\nsum of primordial and simple and sequential decay contributions to the particle distribution (for details see [12]).\nThe pseudorapidity density of particle species i is given by\ndNi\n=\nd\u03b7\n\nZ\n\n2\n\nd pT\n\ndy dNi\n=\nd\u03b7 d2 pT dy\n\nZ\n\nd2 pT\n\np\ndNi\n.\nEi d2 pT dy\n\n(6)\n\nAnalogously, the transverse energy pseudorapidity density for the same species can be written as\ndET,i\n=\nd\u03b7\n\nZ\n\npT dy dNi\nd pT \u00cai *\n=\np d\u03b7 d2 pT dy\n2\n\nZ\n\nd2 pT pT\n\n\u00cai dNi\n.\nEi d2 pT dy\n\n(7)\n\nFor the quantities at midrapidity one has\ndNi\nd\u03b7\n\ndET,i\nd\u03b7\n\nmid\n\nmid\n\n=\n\nZ\n\n2\n\nd pT\n\n\uf8f1\nR\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 d2 pT pT\n=\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3 R d2 p p\nT T\n\ndNi\nd2 pT dy\n\np\n2\np2T + vc.m.s\nm2i\n,\nmT\n\nmT \u2212\ndNi\ndy\n\nd2 pT\n\ndNi\nd2 pT dy , i\n\n\u221a\n\n2\n1\u2212vc.m.s\nmN\nmT\n\n, i = nucleon\n\n(8)\n\n(9)\n\n6= nucleon .\n\nwhere vc.m.s is the velocity of the center of mass of two colliding nuclei with respect to the laboratory frame (only for\n\u221a\nRHIC vc.m.s = 0). Note that for RHIC at sN N = 200 GeV there is the third possibility in Eq. (9): if i = antinucleon,\nthe analogous formula as for i = nucleon but with mT + mN in the numerator holds.\nThe overall charged particle and transverse energy densities can be expressed as\n\n\f3\n\ndNch\nd\u03b7\n\nmid\n\ndET\nd\u03b7\n\nmid\n\n=\n\nX dNi\n\ni\u2208B\n\n=\n\nd\u03b7\n\nX dET,i\ni\u2208A\n\nd\u03b7\n\nmid\n\nmid\n\n,\n\n(10)\n\n,\n\n(11)\n\nwhere A and B (B \u2282 A) denote sets of species of finally detected particles, namely the set of charged particles\nB = {\u03c0 + , \u03c0 \u2212 , K + , K \u2212 , p, p\u0304}, whereas A also includes photons, KL0 , n and n\u0304 [16].\nIII.\n\nRESULTS\n\nThe general scheme reviewed in the previous section was formulated originally for RHIC [8, 9, 10] and then applied\nfor SPS [14]. Here, this method will be used also for the AGS case. But the different model of the freeze-out\nhypersurface was applied for the description of pT spectra there [1, 4]. In that model (for details see [19]), the freezeout happens instantaneously in the r direction, i.e. at a constant value of t (not at a constant value of \u03c4 as here). The\nmax\nparameters connected with the expansion are the surface velocity \u03b2\u22a5\nand \u03c1max . Therefore, the implementation of\nmax\nvalues of \u03b2\u22a5 obtained within that model into the presented one is entirely ad hoc, nevertheless it works surprisingly\nmax\nfrom [1, 4] into formulae of sect. II, one should invert Eq. (4) to obtain\nwell. To put values of \u03b2\u22a5\nmax\n\u03c1max\n\u03b2\u22a5\n.\n=p\nmax )2\n\u03c4\n1 \u2212 (\u03b2\u22a5\n\n(12)\n\nIt should be recalled here that the value of \u03c4 itself is not necessary to calculate the transverse energy per charged\nparticle, since this parameter cancels in the ratio.\nThe final results of numerical estimates of dET /d\u03b7|mid and dNch /d\u03b7|mid together with the corresponding experimental data are listed in Table I. To make predictions for the AGS case it has been assumed that the maximal\ntransverse size \u03c1max equals the average of radii of two colliding nuclei and the nucleus radius has been expressed as\n1\nRA = r0 A 3 , r0 = 1.12 fm. Generally, the estimates agree well with the data. However, for RHIC the 11% \u2212 16%\nunderestimation of the charged particle density has been found. But this simply reflects the existing inconsistency\nin measurements of the charged particle multiplicity at RHIC. Namely, the sum of integrated charged hadron yields\n[20], after converting to dNch /d\u03b7 [17], is substantially less then the directly measured dNch /d\u03b7|mid [21]. This is shown\nexplicitly in the last column of Table I. But values of the sum agree very well with the model predictions. Since the\ngeometric parameters were established from the fits to the same pT spectra, the agreement had to be obtained. Also\nfor AGS the results agree qualitatively well with the data, in spite of the roughness of the method applied for this\ncase. The overall error of evaluations of transverse energy and charged particle densities is about 0.5% and is caused\nby: (a) omission of the most complex cascades; (b) simplifications in numerical procedures for more involved cascades.\nThe velocity of the center of mass of two colliding nuclei, vc.m.s , equals: 0 for RHIC, 0.994 for SPS Pb-Pb collisions\nat 158 * A GeV, 0.918 for AGS Au-Au collisions at 11 * A GeV and 0.678 for AGS Si-Pb collisions at 14.6 * A GeV.\nValues of the ratio dET /d\u03b7|mid /dNch /d\u03b7|mid can be also calculated. They are collected in Table II, together with\nthe corresponding data. The overall overestimation of the order of 15% has been obtained. In the RHIC case this is the\nresult of the underestimation of dNch /d\u03b7|mid , which has been explained earlier. But when in the denominator of the\nexperimental ratio, dNch /d\u03b7|mid from the summing up of integrated hadron yields is put, the theoretical predictions\nagree very well with the data. Note that the similar inconsistency in charged particle measurements could have also\nbeen the origin of the discrepancy between model and experimental values of dNch /d\u03b7|mid seen in the AGS Si-Pb\ncase. For SPS, the result agrees with the experimental value within errors. The overall error of model evaluations of\nthe ratio is less than 1%. These results have been also depicted together with the data in Fig. 1. One can see that\nthe relative positions of theoretical points agree very well with the data, they are shifted up only and this is the effect\nof the overestimation discussed earlier.\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nThe expanding thermal hadron gas model has been used to reproduce transverse energy and charged particle\nmultiplicity pseudorapidity densities and their ratio measured at AGS, SPS and RHIC.

Black dots denote\nevaluations of the ratio in the framework of the present model (the second column\n\u221a of Table II). Also data points for AGS [25]\n(a\ncircle\nfor\nAu-Au\nand\na\nvertical\nbar\nfor\nSi-Pb),\nSPS\n[23]\n(triangle),\nRHIC\nat\nsNN = 130 GeV [16] (square) and RHIC at\n\u221a\nsNN = 200 GeV [17] (star) are depicted. For RHIC, points with the sum of integrated charged hadron yields substituted for\nthe denominator are also depicted (crosses).\n\nanalysis originates from the fact that the transverse energy and the charged particle multiplicity are independent\nobservables, so they can be used as new tools to verify the consistency of predictions of a statistical model for all\ncolliders simultaneously. The predictions have been made at the previous estimates of thermal and geometric freezeout parameters obtained from analyses of measured particle ratios and pT spectra at AGS [1, 4], SPS [13, 14] and\nRHIC [11, 12]. The overall good agreement, not only of the ratio but also absolute values of dET /d\u03b7 |mid and\ndNch /d\u03b7|mid , with the data has been achieved. And the observed discrepancies can be explained reasonably. This\nstrongly supports the idea that the thermal expanding source is responsible for the soft part of the particle production\nin heavy-ion collisions. In addition, the description of various observables is consistent within one statistical model.\nThere are more arguments in favour of the above statement. One could think that this analysis is a kind of an\ninternal consistency check of various measurements. And such a check could be done even in an model-independent\nway simply by integrating spectra of stable particles. But it can not be done without any external input. First,\ntransverse momentum spectra are measured in limited ranges, so very important low-pT regions are not covered by\nthe data. Therefore, to obtain integrated yields some extrapolations below and above the measured ranges are used.\nIn fact these extrapolations are only analytical fits without any physical reasoning, but contributions from regions\n\n\f6\ncovered by them account for 25% \u2212 40% of the yield [20]. On the other hand, a calorimeter acts very effectively in\nthe low-pT range, namely pions with pT \u2264 0.35 GeV/c, kaons with pT \u2264 0.64 GeV/c and protons and antiprotons\nwith pT \u2264 0.94 GeV/c are all captured [16]. Since the very accurate predictions for the transverse energy density\nat midrapidity have been obtained (see Table I), the present analysis can be understood as an undirect proof that in\nthese unmeasurable pT regions spectra are also explicable by means of the thermal source with flow and decays.\nMoreover, it is impossible to check the consistency of the transverse energy data because not all stable hadron\nspectra are measured. This mainly concerns neutrons and KL0 . Also it is impossible to extract hadron decay photons\nfrom the photon data. And again, the very good agreement of model estimates of the transverse energy density at\nmidrapidity with the data can be interpreted as the strong argument that the production of neutral stable particles\ncan be described in terms of the expanding thermal source with superimposed decays.\nAnd as the last remark: in opposite to the transverse energy, there is some inconsistency (of the order of 10%) of\nthe independent measurements of the charged particle multiplicity with the corresponding sums of integrated charged\nparticle yields at RHIC (see sect. III). But at the present stage of investigation it is difficult to judge whether this\ninconsistency has the physical or experimental reason.\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe author gratefully acknowledges very stimulating discussions with Wojciech Broniowski and Wojciech\nFlorkowski.
