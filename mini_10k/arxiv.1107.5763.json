Wilson- and 't Hooft-loop computations\nin these theories have been performed using localization techniques in [1, 2] and matrix\nmodels [3]. Localization methods of [1] have also provided the basis for the AGT conjecture [4, 5] which relates supersymmetric quantities of four-dimensional N = 2 SCFTs\nto correlators in two-dimensional SCFTs [6, 7]. Investigations of S-duality properties of\ngeneral N = 2 SCFTs have led to a better understanding of the moduli space of these\ntheories [8, 9], and in particular to a conjecture about the existence of families of strongly\ncoupled N = 2 SCFTs without a Lagrangian description [10]. Novel connections between\nintegrable systems and N = 2 gauge theories have been discovered in [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16].\nWithin the context of the AdS/CF T correspondence, a proposal for the supergravity\nduals of N = 2 SCFTs has been made in M-theory [17] and in the Type IIA reduction [18]1 . These spacetimes were found using an approach developed for the study of\nthe Killing spinor equations (KSEs) of supergravity using spinor bilinears and the ansatz\nof [21].2 Further, it has been shown in [24] that [21] is indeed the most general solution\nwith the chosen spacetime ansatz. Given the existence of these M-theory and IIA solutions, a natural question is whether solutions dual to N = 2 SCFTs can be found in Type\nIIB supergravity. In this paper we perform a systematic search for Type IIB supergravity\nsolutions that have N = 2 SCFT duals. We do this by considering spacetimes with AdS5\nand S 2 factors which realise the SO(2, 4) conformal and SU (2) R-symmetries geometrically. A detailed analysis of the KSEs and resulting bispinor relations reveals that no\nsolutions beyond the maximally supersymmetric AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 solution exist. The earlier\npaper [25] showed that no IIB supergravity solutions with AdS5 \u00d7 S 2 \u00d7 S 1 and AdS5 \u00d7 S 3\nfactors (with each factor warped over a two-dimensional Riemann surface) exist. The first\ntype of spacetime is a sub-class of the ansatz that we take in this paper, 3 and our results\nare consistent with the lack of solutions of this type.\nAt first sight, one might expect other ways of realising the SU (2) R-symmetry geometrically. However, in appendix F of [21] it is shown that the U (1) Killing direction cannot\nbe fibred over the S 2 associated with the SU (2) R-symmetry. Although this more general\nansatz preserves SU (2) symmetry, if the Killing spinor is charged under translations in\nthe U (1)-direction, in other words, if the U (1) is an R-symmetry, then the supercharges\ncannot form an SU (2) doublet. To see an example of this, one might consider a IIB spacetime containing an S 3 squashed along its Hopf fibre. While this background preserves an\nSU (2) \u00d7 U (1) isometry the corresponding Killing spinors [26, 27] transform as singlets of\n1\n\nSingular solutions obtained via non-Abelian T-duality [19] from AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 appeared in [20].\nM2 and M5-brane probes in these backgrounds corresponding to loop and surface operators in the\ndual N = 2 SCFT have been studied in [22] and [23].\n3\nWe allow for the possibility of the U (1) R-symmetry direction to be fibred and warped.\n2\n\n\fSU (2).4 As a result, the only way to realise the SU (2) R-symmetry geometrically in a\nway that is consistent with the superconformal algebra is by including a round S 2 factor\nin the metric.\nSince we do not find any IIB solutions with such an S 2 factor beyond the maximally\nsupersymmetric AdS5 \u00d7 S 5 solution we conclude that if IIB supergravity duals do exist\nfor generic N = 2 SCFTs the SU (2) R-symmetry is realised non-geometrically. The\npossibility that the SU (2) R-symmetry is realised non-geometrically, was raised in the\ncontext of non-conformal N = 2 SYM theory in [28, 29]. It is possible that by including\nsources into the supergravity equations and realising the SU (2) on the corresponding\nbranes one may realise the N = 2 superconformal algebra without an S 2 factor in the\nspacetime. Or perhaps in the context of IIB the R-symmetry is only realised in the full\nstring theory rather than the supergravity? A mild caveat to the above is that we take the\ninternal space to be compact. Relaxing such a constraint, one still has the possibility of\nnon-compact solutions with field content incorporating a constant five-form flux and nonconstant harmonic axion and dilation, but only in the case when the complex three-form\nflux is zero [30].\nThe structure of this paper runs as follows. In section 2 we review the general reduction\nof IIB supergravity used in [30] for spacetimes with an AdS5 factor. In section 3 we reduce\nfurther on a round S 2 , and write down the resulting algebraic and differential KSEs. Using\nthese, in section 4 we look for potential Sasaki-Einstein type solutions. In section 5 we\nsearch for general solutions preserving our ansatz. Using some bispinor algebra we identify\ntwo putative Killing vector directions and find the conditions necessary for each of these\nto correspond to a global U (1) symmetry. In section 6 we show that the global U (1)\nsymmetry constraints imply, that either the solution is the maximally supersymmetric\nAdS5 \u00d7 S 5 or the Killing vectors are zero. Finally, in section 7 we show that when these\ntwo Killing vectors are zero, the KSEs imply that the Killing spinors are also zero. This\ncompletes the demonstration that no solutions of the abovementioned form exist in IIB\nsupergravity. In section 7 we also show that a similar argument holds more generally in\nthe case of N = 1 AdS5 backgrounds originally investigated in [30]. In that setting a\nunique Killing vector was identified (it was denoted as K5 in [30] and we will write it as\nK5GM SW ). One may want to ask what happens when we restrict the Killing spinors in a\nway that makes the vector equal to zero. Our analysis shows that in that case too, the\nKSEs imply that all the Killing spinors are zero, and hence, that no such solution exists.\n\n2\n\nType IIB Review\n\nIn order to define some notation, in this section we review the construction of [30] for\nKSEs in Type IIB supergravity [31] with a spacetime containing an AdS5 factor. We\nwill be essentially following the notation and conventions of [30]. Solutions of type IIB\n4\n\nWe are greatful to Linda Uruchurtu for an explanation of this and related discussions.\n\n\fsupergravity in Einstein frame, preserve supersymmetry as long as the following variations\nvanish\n1\ni P1 P2 P3 P4\n(\u0393 P1 P2 P3 GP1 P2 P3 \u2212 9\u0393P1 P2 GM P1 P2 )\u01ebc +\n\u0393\nFM P1 P2 P3 P4 \u01eb,\n96 M\n192\ni\n(2.1)\n\u03b4\u03bb \u2243 i\u0393M PM \u01ebc + \u0393P1 P2 P3 GP1 P2 P3 \u01eb,\n24\n\n\u03b4\u03c8M\n\n\u2243 DM \u01eb \u2212\n\nwhere F denotes the self-dual five-form flux, G the complex three-form flux and P the\ncomplex axion-dilaton.

In addition, there is a manifest SL(2, R) action transforming the\nconstituents of P and G [32].\nOne also has a local U (1) invariance associated to the gauge field QM , with the spinor\n\u01eb, fields P and G charged with charge 21 , 2 and 1 respectively.

By examining\nintegrability of the supersymmetry conditions, it was shown in appendix D of [30] that\nfor spacetimes with AdS5 factors that the equations of motion are a consequence of supersymmetry. Our analysis will later make use of these equations of motion, so we recast\nthem later in terms of the three-dimensional field content.\n\n3\n\nSupersymmetry conditions in lower dimensions\n\nIn this section we review the reduction of the supersymmetry conditions on AdS5 presented\nin [30], and extend those results by further decomposing on a round S 2 to three-dimensions.\nWe begin with the ansatz used in [30] for the ten-dimensional spacetime\nds210 = e2\u2206 [ds2 (AdS5 ) + ds2 (M5 )],\nF\n\n= (volAdS5 + volM5 )f .\n\n(3.1)\n\nAbove f constant, and Q, P and G all can take values on M5 .

We will see from the spinor bilinear analysis below that one encounters multiple\nKilling directions, where the warp factor B depends on some of the Killing directions.\nFrom the Killing spinor equation on M3 we show that M3 is isomorphic to S 3 and proceed\nto construct explicitly the S 3 Killing vectors from the vector bilinears. Back in fivedimensions, this translates into M5 being simply S 5 or some quotient (for example [34]).\nWe begin by recalling the observation in [30] that the Sasaki-Einstein geometries correspond to choosing \u03be2 = 0 in D = 5, which, in turn, sets \u01eb2\u00b1 = 0 in our D = 3 notation. In\nthis setting, we can also use arguments presented in [30] showing that the three-form flux,\nG, is zero, and the axion and dilaton are simply constants when M5 is compact5 . The only\nremaining non-constant scalar is then the warp factor, B, with the overall ten-dimensional\nwarp factor, \u2206 becoming a constant\ne\u22124\u2206 f = 4m.\n\n(4.1)\n\nAs an aside, observe that, as d\u2206 = 0, (4.1) is consistent with the Einstein equation in the\nAdS5 directions (3.23).\n5\n\nHarmonic functions f satisfy the maximum principle: if K is any compact subset of a connected set\nU , then f , restricted to K, is a constant.\n\n\fWith these simplifications, the three-dimensional supersymmetry conditions reduce to\n\u2207m \u01eb\u00b1 + 2i m\u03c3m \u01eb\u2213 = 0,\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u00b1ie\u2212B + im \u01eb\u00b1 + \u03c3 m \u2202m B\u01eb\u2213 = 0,\n\n(4.2)\n(4.3)\n\nwhere we have dropped redundant subscripts and replaced D with \u2207 as now Q = 0. The\nfamiliar reader will identify above the Killing spinor equation on S 3 [35], a fact that we\nwill return to soon.\nIn the present case, the relevant scalar spinor bilinears are S1 , S2 , T1 and U1 , while the\nvector bilinears are K 1 , K 2 , L1 , M 1 , M 2 and N 1 (cf. equations (B.1) and (B.2) in the\nappendix). Using equation (4.2) it is possible to determine the scalar bilinear differential\nconditions\ndS1 = 0 ,\n\n(4.4)\n\ndS2 = mI(L1 ) ,\n\n(4.5)\n\ndT1 = \u2212imK 2 ,\n\n(4.6)\n\ndU1 = \u2212imM 2 .\n\n(4.7)\n\nWe can also determine the following algebraic expressions from (4.3)\nS2 = \u2212meB S1 ,\nR(T1 ) = 0 .\n\n(4.8)\n(4.9)\n\nAbove R and I denote the real and imaginary parts of a complex number. Using the\nalgebraic and differential KSEs one can show that show that K 1 , R(L1 ), M 1 and N 1 are\nKilling directions. For the moment, we postpone any attempt to determine the relationship\nbetween these Killing directions. In general, we have 6 Killing vectors as M 1 and N 1 are\ncomplex, however we stress that some of these Killing vectors may be trivially zero for a\nparticular choice of the spinors, while it is also possible that they align as noted in [24].\nTo have a geometry dual to N = 2 SCFTs, we require the existence of a single overall\nU (1) isometry direction from the above list.\nThese directions will generate symmetries of the overall spacetime, presenting us with\ncandidate U (1) R-symmetry directions, provided the warp factor, B, is independent of the\nKilling directions. From (4.3), we may determine the following relationships\niK 1 dB = \u2212e\u2212B I(T1 ) ,\niR(L1 ) dB = 0 ,\niM 1 dB = ie\u2212B U1 ,\niN 1 dB = 0 .\n\n(4.10)\n\nIf we demand that these directions correspond to R-symmetries (global U (1)'s), we may\nshow that there is no geometry. To see this, note that from (4.9) and (4.10), we have\n\n\fT1 = 0 if K 1 is either zero or an R-symmetry direction. The derivative of T1 ,\ndT1 = \u2212imK 2 ,\n\n(4.11)\n\nthen tells us that K 2 is zero. Finally, we can see that K 1 is also zero from (B.12). Together\nK 1 = K 2 = 0 tell us that \u01eb+ = \u01eb\u2212 = 0, thus ruling out a solution. A similar conclusion\nmay be reached working with U1 , M 1 and M 2 .\nIn fact, one may show directly that the D = 3 KSEs imply that the space M3 is a\nthree-sphere. Evoking the integrability relationship\n1\n\u2207[m \u2207n] \u01eb\u00b1 = Rmnpq \u03c3 pq \u01eb\u00b1 ,\n8\n\n(4.12)\n\none can show that\n\n1\nm2 \u01ebmnp \u03c3 p \u01eb\u00b1 = Rmnq1 q2 \u01ebq1 qq23 \u03c3 q3 \u01eb\u00b1 .\n(4.13)\n2\nThis implies that M3 is a manifold of constant curvature. Then, it is well known [36], that\nfor any n-dimensional connected, complete Riemannian manifold M of constant curvature\n1\n, the universal covering manifold of M is isomorphic to a sphere of radius a, M = S n /G,\na2\nwhere G denotes some finite subgroup of O(n + 1) that acts freely.\nHaving confirmed that there is one smooth (maximally) supersymmetric geometry that\nsatisfies the above conditions on the spinor bilinears, it is an instructive exercise to recover\nM3 = S 3 from the conditions on the spinor bilinears directly. We start by dropping the\nrequirement I(T1 ) = 0, thus allowing the warp factor B to depend on the Killing directions\non M3 , while for simplicity also setting m = 1. Observe that the 6 Killing vectors noted\nearlier now may be interpreted as the generators of SO(4), the symmetry of the threesphere. We will now show that orthonormal frame ei , which may be read off from the\nvector bilinears \u01ed\u03c3i \u01ebei , is simply that corresponding to a three-sphere.\nWe begin by rotating K 1 and K 2 into the e1 , e2 plane. Since these are just two vectors,\nit is always valid to do this. After rotation, the conditions \u01ed\u00b1 \u03c33 \u01eb\u00b1 = 0 may be satisfied\nby writing\n!\n!\nei\u03c61\nei\u03c81\n\u01eb+ = r1\n, \u01eb \u2212 = r2\n,\n(4.14)\nei\u03c62\nei\u03c82\nwhere ri correspond to the norms of the spinors. The norms on the spinors may be\ndetermined from (4.8) and constant S1 = 1:\n\u03b8\nr1 = sin ,\n2\n\n\u03b8\nr2 = cos .\n2\n\n(4.15)\n\nIt is worth noting that with this choice eB = cos \u03b8, so that the overall S 5 is the following\nfibration\nds2 (S 5 ) = cos2 \u03b8ds2 (S 2 ) + d\u03b8 2 + sin2 \u03b8ds2 (S 2 ).\n(4.16)\nAs B is just a function of \u03b8, we align the \u03b8-direction with e1 . By combining (4.10)\nand the knowledge that R(L1 ) and N1 are not along e1 , K 1 * R(L1 ) = 0 from the Fierz\n\n\fidentity, and d(eB ) = \u2212I(L1 ) from (4.5) and (4.8), one finds consistent conditions that\nwhittle down the angles to two. The form of the spinors is then\n!\n!\nei\u03c61\nei\u03c62\n\u03b8\n\u03b8\n\u01eb+ = sin\n, \u01eb\u2212 = \u2212i cos\n.\n(4.17)\n2\n2\nei\u03c62\nei\u03c61\nThe ei labeling the orthonormal frame may then be read off from d(eB ) = \u2212I(L1 ),\n(4.6) and (4.7), leading to the following\ne1 = \u2212d\u03b8,\n\ne2 = sin \u03b8(d\u03c61 \u2212 d\u03c62 ),\n\ne3 = sin \u03b8 sin(\u03c61 \u2212 \u03c62 )(d\u03c61 + d\u03c62 ).\n\n(4.18)\n\nA redefinition\n\u03c6 = \u03c61 \u2212 \u03c62 ,\n\n\u03c8 = \u03c61 + \u03c62 ,\n\n(4.19)\n\nrecovers the metric on S 3 with unit radius. As another consistency check we work out the\nKilling vectors for the space:\nK 1 \u2192 \u2212 cos \u03c6\u2202\u03b8 + sin \u03c6 cot \u03b8\u2202\u03c6\nR(L1 ) \u2192 \u2212\u2202\u03c8\nsin \u03c8\n\u2202\u03c8 ),\nsin \u03c6\ncos \u03c8\n\u2202\u03c8 ),\n\u2192 \u2212 sin \u03c6 sin \u03c8\u2202\u03b8 \u2212 cot \u03b8(cos \u03c6 sin \u03c8\u2202\u03c6 +\nsin \u03c6\n\u2192 sin \u03c8\u2202\u03c6 + cos \u03c8 cot \u03c6\u2202\u03c8 , \u2212 cos \u03c8\u2202\u03c6 + sin \u03c8 cot \u03c6\u2202\u03c8 .\n\nM 1 \u2192 \u2212 sin \u03c6 cos \u03c8\u2202\u03b8 \u2212 cot \u03b8(cos \u03c6 cos \u03c8\u2202\u03c6 \u2212\n\nN1\n\n(4.20)\n\nThese are simply the generators of SO(4). Note neither R(L1 ) nor N 1 have components\nalong the \u03b8 direction, a fact that is consistent with (4.10). Observe also that K 1 and\nR(L1 ) are commuting. We will see this is the case later when we turn to the more general\ncase.\nFinally, before moving onto the general case, we remark that multiple Killing directions\nalso appeared in [33], and, in particular, the Lie derivative of a similar S 2 warp-factor with\nrespect to one Killing direction was found to be non-zero. Though this Killing direction\nwas consistently removed from the supersymmetry conditions and subsequent analysis led\nto a class of known geometries [37, 38], in the light of observations here, it would be\ninteresting to revisit that example and retain all the Killing vectors.\n\n5\n\nA tale of two Killing vectors\n\nIn this section we consider the general form of our ansatz and start by identifying the\ncandidate Killing directions. Recall that a U (1) Killing direction (denoted K5GM SW ) exists\nin D = 5 [30] for a general M5 and generic values of all fields. As a result, we naturally\nexpect this U (1) direction to descend from D = 5 to give a solution to the Killing equation\n\n\fin D = 3. In fact, it is possible to identify the combination X = K 1 + K 3 and the\ncombination Y = R(L1 + L6 ) (see appendix for the explicit definitions of the spinor\nbilinears) as solutions to the Killing equation for all values of the spacetime fields. The\nD = 5 Killing direction K5GM SW = 21 (\u03be\u03041 \u03b3 m \u03be1 + \u03be\u03042 \u03b3 m \u03be2 ) can be decomposed using our\nansatz our ansatz (3.8) to give\nK5GM SW = (\u03c7\u0304+ \u03c33 \u03c7+ )X + (\u03c7\u0304+ \u03c7+ )Y.\n\n(5.1)\n\nIn other words, K5GM SW is a particular linear combination of the two Killing directions\nwe found in D = 3; note that the coefficients in the linear combinatoins are independent\nof M3 .\nOur analysis so far shows that X and Y are Killing directions on M3 . Since we\nonly expect one U (1) R-symmetry, one possible interpretation might be that either X\nor Y generates the R-symmetry, with the other vector simply corresponding to a U (1)\nisometry direction unrelated to the R-symmetry. Such an example exists in the uplift of the\nY p,q spaces [39] to M-theory [40] where the Reeb vector associated with the R-symmetry\ncombines with another U (1) from Y p,q to give the R-symmetry direction in M-theory. See\nappendix C of [41] for further discussion on this subject.\nLet us first check then, under what conditions X may be promoted to a U (1) isometry\nof the overall solution. X corresponding to an overall U (1) is an important prerequisite for\nit being identified as an R-symmetry direction. We proceed to calculate the Lie derivative\nof the various fields and warp factors with respect to X. After some arithmetic we find\nLX \u2206 = 0 ,\nLX B = \u22122e\u2212B I(T1 + T6 ) ,\nLX P = 0,\n\n\u21d2 LX Q = 0 ,\n\nLX A = 0 ,\niX dg = 0 .\n\n(5.2)\n\nTo derive these equations we use the algebraic conditions (3.13) - (3.18), equation (B.3),\nequation of motion for g (3.21), the Bianchi identity (3.22) as well as iX P = 0. As a\nresult we conclude that the Killing direction, X, can be promoted to a symmetry of the\nfull solution provided\nI(T1 + T6 ) = 0 .\n(5.3)\nWe now show that this condition implies either f = 0 or g = 0 or X = 0. At each step\nwe will assume that both f and g are non-zero and will ultimately show that this implies\nX = 0. In section 6 below we will then consider the case X 6= 0 and f = g = 0, while in\nsection 7 below we will consider the case X = 0. Firstly, equations (5.3), (B.6) and (B.9)\nimply T2 = T5 = 0. Combining this result with equations (B.11), (B.17) and (B.18) one\nfinds that L3 = L4 and K 2 = K 4 . Using the latter relation, together with equation (5.3),\n\n\fand T2 = T5 = 0 in equations (B.12) and (B.13) we find that X = K 1 + K 3 = 0. To sum\nup we have shown that X is an isometry of the full solution only when f or g is zero.\nWe now turn to the analysis of Y . One can be show that\nLY \u2206 = 0 ,\n\n(5.4)\n\nLY B = 0 ,\n\n(5.5)\n\nLY P = 0 ,\n\n(5.6)\n\nLY g = f g(S1 + S3 ) = 0 ,\n\n(5.7)\n\nLY A = 2e4\u2206+2B (g\u2217 P \u2212 2d\u2206g) \u2212 if A = 0 .\n\n(5.8)\n\nIn deriving these identitites we have used equations (3.11) and (3.12), the algebraic conditions (3.13) - (3.18), the Bianchi identity (3.22), equations of motion (3.21), equations (B.15) and (B.16), as well as reality properties of the spinor bilinears. 6\nIt is worth noting that (5.7) is a particularly strong constraint. S1 + S3 is a constant\nrelated to the norm of the spinors and cannot be zero, so either f = 0 or g = 0 7 .\nOur two cases have now coalesced and we proceed to show that both f and g are zero.\nNow if one adopts f = 0, one sees from (B.4) and (B.5) that S2 = S4 , while (B.7) and\n(B.8) in turn confirm that g is also zero. Therefore, f = 0 \u21d2 g = 0.\nFrom the relations derived in the appendix, it is not obvious that g = 0 implies f = 0.\nHowever, as is clear from the equations of motion (3.21), when g = 0, either f = 0 or\nA = 0. When A = 0, the type IIB three-form flux vanishes and it is possible to show that\nboth the axion and dilaton are harmonic. Then, if M3 is compact, as in the case of most\ninterest to AdS/CFT, one deduces that both are constants using the maximum principle\nof harmonic forms.\nReturning to five-dimensions, we are now on the cusp of declaring that the fivedimensional geometry is Sasaki-Einstein when A = g = 0 i.e. no three-form flux. However,\nbefore making such a statement, we require one of the spinors \u03bei appearing in (3.2) to (3.7)\nto vanish. Recall that it was shown in [30] that \u03be2 = 0 implies the five-dimensional space\nis Sasaki-Einstein. Indeed, when the three-form flux is zero, it is a simple exercise to show\nthat (3.4) and (3.5) together imply d\u2206(\u03be\u03041 \u03be1 + \u03be\u03042 \u03be2 ) = 0. In other words \u2206 is a constant\nand the Killing spinor equations can only be satisfied if one of the \u03bei is zero. The property\nthat the five-dimensional space is then Sasaki-Einstein follows and the analysis reverts to\nthat in the previous section.\n6\n\nFor example, the fact that S1 , . . . , S4 are real.\nNote we have derived (5.7) on the assumption that dg 6= 0 and this constraint on f and g disappears\nonce g is a constant. However, when g is constant it is possible to derive a new version of (5.8) stating\n7\n\nLY A = 0 \u21d2 2dBg \u2212 iQg + Pg \u2217 = 0.\n\n(5.9)\n\nObserve now that the warp factor B is charged under X whereas P and Q are not. This expression can\nonly be consistent if either g = 0, or LX B = 0, which we have seen from the last section also implies either\nf = 0 or g = 0. So, the implication of one of f or g being zero does not change when g is a constant.\n\n\fIn summary, in this section we have shown that requiring either of the Killing directions\nX or Y to correspond to a global U (1) symmetry corresponding to the R-symmetry, implies\nthat f = g = 0. We turn our focus to the analysis of these spacetimes in the next section.\n\nGeometries with f = g = 0\n\n6\n\nIn the last section we showed that the Killing vectors X and Y on M3 could be promoted\nto global U (1) isometries provided we restrict our ansatz by setting f = g = 0. In this\nsection we restrict our ansatz to f = g = 0. 8 We show that, for such backgrounds,\nrequiring X or Y to be a global U (1) symmetry results in X and Y being equal to zero.\nThe same result holds also if one entertains the idea that a linear combination of X and\nY correspond to the R-symmetry direction. In the next section we will show that the\ncondition X = Y = 0 together with the KSEs in fact sets the Killing spinors to zero,\nleaving us with no solutions.\nWe start, by further examining the Killing directions when f = g = 0. As noted in\nsection 4 above, when some of the field content is removed, extra Killing directions may\nemerge. After re-examining the KSEs with f = g = 0, we find that in the present case\nthere are no new Killing directions. We now examine the relationship between X and\nY by checking to see if the Killing vectors commute. This may be done by calculating\nthe Lie derivative LX Y . Making use of the Fierz identity and the identities \u03c3mp \u03c3q \u03c3 m =\n\u2212\u03c3 m \u03c3q \u03c3mp = 2\u03b4pq , one can show indeed that iX dY = iY dX = 0 and that the vectors\ncommute\nLX Y = [X , Y ] = 0 .\n(6.1)\nRecall that in the LLM geometry [21], which has a similar ansatz, two Killing directions\nalign to give the R-symmetry [24]. In the IIB geometry we are presently considering, it is\npossible to use the Fierz identity to show that X and Y are in fact orthogonal 9\nX * Y = 0.\n\n(6.2)\n\nThe algebraic constraints (3.13) - (3.20), together with f = g = 0 can be used to\n8\n\nAll equations in this section are derived with f = g = 0.\nFirstly, one shows that K 1 * R(L1 ) = K 3 * R(L6 ) = 0 using (6.6) below, while the cross-terms can be\nconfirmed to vanish by using two iterations of the Fierz identity, (6.6) again and (6.4) below.\n9\n\n\fobtain the following spinor bilnear relations\nS1 = S3 ,\n\nS2 = S4 ,\n\n(6.3)\n\nT3 + T4 = 0,\n\n(6.4)\n\nU3 + U4 = 0,\n\n(6.5)\n\nR(T1 ) = R(T6 ) = 0,\nU2 \u2212 U5 = \u22123meB (U2 + U5 ),\nB\n\nT2 \u2212 T5 = \u22123me (T2 + T5 ),\nS2 = \u22123meB S1 .\n\n(6.6)\n(6.7)\n(6.8)\n(6.9)\n\nFrom the vector bilinear differential conditions, we note that the two Killing vectors\nX and Y satisfy\ndX = 2m \u2217 Y, dY = 2m \u2217 X.\n(6.10)\nAs an aside, observe that d \u2217 X = d \u2217 Y = 0, so that the Laplacian acting on X or Y\nbecomes \u2217d\u2217dX = 4m2 X. Interestingly, if M3 is a three-dimensional compact Riemannian\nEinstein space normalised such that Rmn = 2m2 gmn , the Laplacian eigenvalues \u03ba satisfy\n\u03ba \u2265 4m2 with saturation happening when the one-form is Killing [42]. This precisely what\none notes above for X and Y .\nIn addition, we also see from the vector torsion conditions that X satisfies\ndX = 2dB \u2227 X.\n\n(6.11)\n\nSo what have we learned about M3 ? We have seen that M3 has two orthogonal Killing\ndirections, so we can think of M3 having three directions: X, Y and an additional direction\nparameterised by, say, \u03b8. Observe that X and Y are coupled, so we cannot set one of them\nto zero without also setting the other to zero. Presently, we explore the possibility that\nX 6= 0 6= Y and that either X or Y corresponds to the U (1) R-symmetry (and so a global\nU (1) symmetry) while the other is simply a generic isometry direction.\nX is a global U (1) symmetry direction\nRecall from section 5 that X can be a global U (1) symmetry if I(T1 + T6 ) = 0. As T1 and\nT6 are both pure imaginary, combining (6.8), (B.19), (B.20), (B.12) and (B.13), together\nwith f = g = 0 one can show that\nX = K 2 + K 4 = AT2 = AT5 = 0 .\n\n(6.12)\n\nBut equation (6.10) then implies that Y = 0. So requiring that X is a global U (1)\nsymmetry implies that X = Y = 0.\nY is a global U (1) symmetry direction\nInstead let us see what happens when we require that Y be a global U (1) symmetry.\nRecall that presently M3 is parametrised by three directions X, Y and \u03b8. Equations (5.2)\n\n\fand (6.11) imply that B depends on X and \u03b8, but is independent of the Y -direction. We\nalso recall, from the results in section 5 that both A and d\u2206 have only components along\nthe \u03b8-direction. Then from equation (B.14) one can see that I(L1 + L6 ) has no component\nalong the X or Y directions. This last fact, in conjunction with a similar observation for\nd\u2206, implies, via equation (B.10), that B has no X-dependence afterall. As a result\nI(T1 + T6 ) = 0 ,\nand so X = Y = 0.\n\n(6.13)\n\n10\n\nTo summarise, in this section we have shown that one cannot require X or Y or any\nlinear combination to be a global U (1) symmetry direction. In the next section we will\ninvestigate the possibility that both X and Y are zero.\n\n7\n\nNew R-symmetry directions?\n\nIn the last section we saw that the KSEs do not allow for X or Y to be global U (1)\nsymmetry directions, and, hence, they cannot be U (1) R-symmetry directions either. We\nare left with the posibility that X = Y = 0. It is easy to show that these conditions alone\ndo not force all the Killing spinors to be zero. Rather, they merely reduce the number of\nindependent Killing spinor components. As such, a priori it appears possible to consider\nthe KSEs with this restricted choice of Killing spinors, and to re-start a search for solutions.\nSuch a possibility appears already in the N = 1 setting discussed in [30]. There a unique\nKilling vector, K5GM SW , was found; 11 and one may wonder whether solutions to the KSEs\nexist for which K5GM SW = 0, and instead a new U (1) R-symmetry Killing vector emerges\nin this restricted setting. 12 In this section we will show that this apparent loophole in\nfact does not lead to any new solutions in the N = 1 case. In particular we will show\nthat setting K5GM SW = 0, together with the KSEs imply that the D = 5 Killing spinors\n\u03bei have to be identically equal to zero. Since the N = 2 case we are considering here is a\nspecial case of the N = 1 geometries studied in [30], and since X = Y = 0 implies that\nK5GM SW = 0, the argument presented in this section will also imply that no solutions exist\nwhen X and Y are set to zero.\nFrom [30] we see that the norm of K5GM SW is\n|K5GM SW |2 = sin2 \u03b6 GM SW + |S GM SW |2 ,\n10\n\n(7.1)\n\nTo get around this argument, one may attempt to set I(L1 + L6 ) = 0. However, this is catastrophic\nas d(4\u2206 + B) = 0 with f = g = 0 means from equations (3.19) and (3.20) that B is also a constant,\ne\u2212B = \u00b13m and that two spinors are zero.\n11\nThroughout this section we shall use the superscript GMSW to denote notation from [30].\n12\nWe are grateful to Dario Martelli and James Sparks for a number of illuminating discussions during\nthe Benasque Strings 2011 workshop on this subject.\n\n\fthus implying that both S GM SW and sin \u03b6 GM SW are zero. Then from equation (3.15) of\nthe same paper we have that the complex vector K GM SW is zero. Furthermore, using\nequation (3.22) of [30], it is possible to show that the two-form bilinear U GM SW is also\nzero. These extra constraints on the spinors may be summarised as\n1\n \u0304\n2 (\u03be\u03041 \u03be1 \u2212 \u03be2 \u03be2 )\n\u03be \u03042c \u03be1 = 0 ,\n\nsin \u03b6 GM SW\n\n=\n\nGM SW\n\n=\n\nK5m GM SW\n\n=\n\nGM SW\nKm\n\n=\n\nm\nm\n1\n2 (\u03be\u03041 \u03b3 \u03be1 + \u03be\u03042 \u03b3 \u03be2 )\n\u03be \u03041c \u03b3m \u03be2 = 0 ,\n\nGM SW\niUmn\n\n=\n\nmn\n1\n\u03be1\n2 (\u03be\u03041 \u03b3\n\nS\n\n= 0,\n\n= 0,\n\n+ \u03be\u03042 \u03b3 mn \u03be2 ) = 0 .\n\n(7.2)\n\nWe now show that these conditions imply \u03be1 = \u03be2 = 0. With the explicit gamma matrix\nrepresentation given in [30] we have\nC5 = 1 \u2297 i\u03c3 2 .\nOne can now decompose \u03be1 and \u03be2 as\n\uf8eb\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\u03be1 = \uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\nr\ns\nt\nu\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7,\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\u03be2 = \uf8ec\n\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\n\n(7.3)\n\nw\nx\ny\nz\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f7,\n\uf8f7\n\uf8f8\n\n(7.4)\n\nwhere the components are in general complex. Now, by combining S GM SW = K GM SW =\n0, one establishes the following relations\ntz = uy, rx = sw, tx = sy,\nuw = rz, ux = sz, tw = ry .\n\n(7.5)\n\nUsing the remaining relationships it is easy to find that one component of \u03be1 or \u03be2 is zero.\nGM SW = U GM SW = 0, it is possible to\nFor example, using (K53 )GM SW = (K54 )GM SW = U13\n14\ninfer that\nz(|r|2 + |w|2 ) = 0 ,\n(7.6)\nso that either z = 0 or r = w = 0 is zero. Once one of the components in \u03be1 or \u03be2\ncan be shown to be zero, the result that \u03be1 = \u03be2 = 0 is immediate from the remaining\nrelationships coming from K5GM SW = U GM SW = 0. Therefore, we conclude that setting\nK5GM SW = 0, together with the KSEs, implies that the Killing spinors are zero.\nIn fact a similar argument can also be seen to hold for the N = 2 case that has been the\nfocus of this paper. When X = Y = 0, we also have K5GM SW = 0 (cf. equation (5.1)). We\ncan then re-write the conditions (7.2), when reduced using the ansatz (3.8). In particular,\nGM SW condition, with m and n in the directions of S 2 is particularly strong (using\nthe Umn\n\n\fthe gamma matrix basis given in the appendix) and implies that the sum of the norms of\n\u01ebi\u00b1 has to be zero, and so the Killing spinors \u01ebi\u00b1 have to be zero themselves.\nThis concludes our analysis. We have used the KSEs to search for Type IIB solutions\nwith AdS5 and S 2 factors and R-symmetry SU (2) \u00d7 U (1). We have found that no nontrivial solutions of such a type exist. Our result suggests that if one can find Type IIB\nsolutions which are holographic duals of four-dimensional N = 2 SCFTs, the SU (2) Rsymmetry will have to be realised in some non-geometric way which does not lead to the\npresence of SU (2) Killing vectors in the spacetime.\n\nAcknowledgements\nWe would like to thank Jerome Gauntlett, Chris Hull, Oleg Lunin, Juan Maldacena,\nHiroaki Nakajima, Dimitri Skliros, Linda Uruchurtu, Oscar Varela, Hossein Yavartanoo,\nand especially Dario Martelli and James Sparks for interesting discussions and sharing their\ninsights with us.

In addition, \u03b312345 = 1. A five-dimensional\nspinor \u03c7, where \u03c7c = C5 \u03c7\u2217 satisfied \u03c7cc = \u2212\u03c7.\nThen adopting the following choice for the decomposition of \u03b3i\n\u03b3\u03b1 = |\u01eb\u03b1\u03b2 |\u03c3\u03b2 \u2297 1,\n\u03b3m+2 = \u03c33 \u2297 \u03c3m ,\n\n(A.2)\n\nwhere \u03b1 = 1, 2, m = 1, 2, 3 and we have introduced somewhat awkward ordering so that\n\u03b312345 = 1 as in [30].
