The presence of zero gap and zero electron\nmass, combined with a rather high mobility at room temperature, makes graphene an unique material for various\nfundamental and applied problems. At present graphene\nis intensively studied both theoretically and experimentally (see e.g. reviews [9, 10]).\nThe study of graphene optics (see [11],[12]) is stimulated by the prediction that the absorption in monolayer\ngraphene should be determined by the fundamental constant \u03b1 = e2 /~c [13], [14] and its experimental evidence\n[15]. The investigation of coupling between photons and\nelectrons in graphene attracts now an active interest of\nthe community (see e.g. [16, 17]). An observation of\namplified stimulated terahertz emission from optically\npumped epitaxial graphene heterostructures has been reported recently [18]. However, the photoinduced currents, namely, photon drag and photogalvanic effects in\ngraphene were beyond of interest of the researchers. In\nthis paper we present the theoretical analysis of these\neffects.\nThe study of light pressure on solids has rather long\nhistory. The simplest variant is an instantaneous transmission of photon momentum to electrons. This process\nis permitted for interband transitions or in presence of\nthe \"third body\", for example, phonons, other electrons,\nimpurities. For a free particle this process is forbidden by\nconservation laws. Small value of the photon momentum\nmakes Nonresonant photon Drag Effect (NDE) extremely\nweak.\nAt the same time there exists a less known variant of\nthis effect, namely Resonant photon Drag Effect (RDE)\n\nwhich has no weakness of usual NDE [19],[20],[21]. Resonance drag occurs when some partial kinetic property\nof electron gas sharply depends on electron energy. A\nsmall photon momentum gives an increase of the electron\nenergy, that can drastically change the relaxation time.\nThis leads to a significantly different contributions to the\nelectron current for electrons exited along or oppositely\nto the photon direction. In [21] the situation was studied for interband transitions in weakly doped GaAs when\nthe electron energy approaches the energy of longitudinal optical phonon. In this case electrons exited along\nthe direction of photon have larger energy than electrons\nin opposite direction. Hence, their energy can exceed the\nthreshold for emission of optical phonon: they quickly\nemit phonons and stop, while the opposite electrons will\nmove freely till they collide with impurity. This gives rise\nto the appearance of charge flow in the direction opposite\nto the light ray.\nHere we develop another idea for RDE based on a\nsharp Fermi distribution which forbids the transitions\nbelow the Fermi energy \u01ebF . This idea is illustrated in\nFig.1. Electrons are excited from the hole cone to the\nelectron cone by photons with frequency \u03c9 and wave\nvector Q. The conditions for resonant transitions are\nsk + s|k \u2212 q| = \u03c9, ~s|k| > \u01ebF , where k is the electron\nmomentum counted from the cone point, s \u2248 108 cm/s is\nthe electron velocity, and q is a projection of the wave\nvector Q of radiation to the plane of graphene. The first\ncondition determines ellipse in k plane, the second limits a part of this ellipse accessible for transitions. The\nwave vector tilts the transitions towards its direction.\nFig. 1 shows the case when the frequency is close to\n2\u01ebF . The electrons in the figure are excited from the\nright segment of the Fermi surface contour. This results\nin electron flow rightwards. Since q \u226a kF the RDE\nappears when the frequency is close to 2\u01ebF , namely if\n|\u03c9 \u2212 2\u01ebF | < sq. Inside this window the current of RDE\n\n\f2\n\nEy\n\nEx\nE\n\nQ\nq\n\nj\n\ny\n\nx\n\nFIG. 2: (Color online) Sketch of proposed experiment (see\ntext for details).\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) Interband phototransitions in ntype graphene. Left panel: diagram of transitions in the\nmomentum-energy space. The hole cone is shifted in k space\nby the photon wave vector q. The transitions are permitted\nonly above the Fermi level. Right panel: projection to the\nmomentum plane. Filled circle represents the Fermi sea, the\nelliptic curve corresponds to the energy conservation equation\ns|k \u2212 q| + sk = \u03c9; only momenta outside the Fermi circle are\npermitted corresponding to the right segment of the elliptic\ncurve.\n\nhas no smallness connected with q and can be estimated\nas j \u223c es\u03c4 \u03c0\u03b1 P/(~\u03c9), where e and s are the electron\ncharge and the velocity, \u03c0\u03b1 is the opacity of graphene,\n\u03c4 is the transport relaxation time and P is the light intensity. Physical meaning of this estimation is evident:\n\u03c4 \u03c0\u03b1P/(~\u03c9) is the instantaneous density of exited electrons which conserve their momentum. Being multiplied\nby the current of individual electrons es, this quantity\ngives the current density.\nBelow we determine both NDE and RDE for interband\ntransitions in monolayer graphene with degenerate electron gas. Due to graphene electron-hole symmetry results\nare applicable to n- and p-type graphene. In general the\nrelaxation process for electrons and holes are different\nthat breaks electron-hole symmetry. For concreteness,\nwe consider the n-type graphene. In this case the mean\nfree time of excited electrons is much longer than that of\nholes since due to different distance from the Fermi level\nholes can easier emit phonons. Thus, the contribution of\nholes will be neglected.\nFig. 2 illustrates a possible experiment on excitation\nof the drag current in a suspended graphene sheet placed\nin (x, y) plane. Light with frequency \u03c9, wave vector Q\n(Q = \u03c9/c) and amplitude of electric field E illuminates\ngraphene plane. We consider transitions near the cone\nsingularity. In this case the current is determined by the\nprojections of the electric field and the wave vector onto\nthe graphene layer.[22] These quantities are E \u2261 eE =\n(Ep cos \u03b2, Es ) and q = (1, 0)Q sin \u03b2, where \u03b2 is the angle\nof incidence, Es and Ep are amplitude components of the\n\nelectric field E perpendicular and parallel to the incident\nplane. We ignore small modification of field caused by\nthe layer.\nII.\n\nBASIC EQUATIONS\n\nThe current of photon drag effect can be expressed via\nthe probability of transition g(k) from the hole state with\na momentum k \u2212 q to the electron state with momentum\nk and the electron velocity v(k) = sk/k as\nZ\ndk\nj = 4e\nv(k)\u03c4 g(k),\n(1)\n4\u03c0 2\nwhere the coefficient 4 accounts for the valley and spin\ndegeneracies. The dependence on the photon momentum\nresults from the momentum and energy conservation laws\nand the matrix elements for transition. For simplicity we\nput below ~ = 1.\nThe two-band Hamiltonian near the Dirac point is\n\u0012\n\u0013\n0\nkx \u2212 iky\n\u0124(k) = s\n= sk\u03c3.\n(2)\nkx + iky\n0\nHere \u03c3 is the vector of the Pauli matrices. The eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Hamiltonian\n(2) are \u01eb\u00b1 (k) =\n\u221a\ni\u03c6k\n\u00b1sk and \u03a8\u00b1 (k) = (1, \u00b1e )/ 2, where \u03c6k is the polar angle of the vector k. The different signs correspond to electrons and holes. The interaction with\nthe wave is determined by the matrix elements of the\nvelocity \u2207k \u0124(k) = s\u03c3 between the hole and electron states with the momenta k \u2212 q and k: v\u2212+ =\n(\u03a8\u2212 (k \u2212 q)\u2217 s\u03c3\u03a8+ (k)), correspondingly.\nThe transition probability g(k) is\ng(k) =\n\n\u03c0e2\n|Ev+\u2212 |2 \u03b4(sk + s|k \u2212 q| \u2212 \u03c9)\u03b8(\u01ebk \u2212 \u01ebF ), (3)\n2\u03c9 2\n\nwhere \u03b8(t) is the Heaviside function. The expression for\ncurrent Eq.(1) can be rewritten as\nZ\nk\ne 3 E 2 s3\najk ej ek \u03b4(sk+s|k \u2212 q|\u2212\u03c9)\u03b8(sk\u2212\u01ebF )\ndk\u03c4\nj=\n2\u03c0\u03c9 2\n|k|\n(4)\n\n\f3\nwhere\najk =\n\n1 \u2212+\u2217 \u2212+\nv\nvk .\ns2 j\n\n(\n\n(5)\n\nWe utilized the symmetry of the tensor aij resulting to\ninclusion of the field polarization in the combinations\ne\u2217i ej + e\u2217j ei only and independence on the degree of circular polarization. Hence, without loss of generality one\ncan consider the field as linear-polarized and e as real.\nDue to the smallness of the wave vector q, as compared\nto the electron momentum, one can expand all quantities in powers of q. Expanding by q we can write the\nargument of the delta-function as sk + s|k \u2212 q| \u2212 \u03c9 \u2248\n2sk \u2212 \u03c9 \u2212 sq cos \u03c6k (we choose the direction of axis x\nalong q). At the same time, q is comparable with 2sk \u2212 \u03c9\nand we keep ourselves from subsequent expansion of the\ndelta-function.\nExpanding the tensor aij , we have\naxx = sin2 \u03c6k (1 +\n\nq\ncos \u03c6k ),\nk\n\nq\nsin2 \u03c6k cos \u03c6k ,\n(6)\nk\nq\n2Re(axy ) = \u22122 sin \u03c6k cos \u03c6k \u2212 sin \u03c6k cos(2\u03c6k )\nk\nayy = cos2 \u03c6k \u2212\n\nFrom Eq.(4) we obtain for components of the current\nmin(1,a)\n\u03c4\ndx\n\u221a\n\u00d7\njx = \u22122J0\n2 \u03c40\n1\n\u2212\nx\n\u22121\nn\ne2x [\u2212x(1 \u2212 x2 )(1 + bx) + 2b(1 \u2212 x2 )(1 \u2212 2x2 )] +\no\ne2y [\u2212x3 (1 + bx) + 4bx2 (1 \u2212 x2 )] ; (7)\nZ min(1,a)\n\u03c4 p\n1 \u2212 x2 \u00d7\njy = 2J0 ex ey\ndx\n\u03c40\n\u22121\nn\no\n\u2212 2x(1 \u2212 x2 )(1 + bx) + 2b(3x2 \u2212 1) .

At the same time the Fermi sea limits the transitions by the direction of the photon wave vector. This\ncircumstances together determine lower x-component of\ncurrent if e||q in comparison with the case e \u22a5 q and\nalso the appearance of y-component of the RDE current.\nIn agreement with the system symmetry, jy exists only\nif the polarization has both ex and ey components. The\nRDE current exists in a narrow window |\u03c9 \u2212 2\u01ebF | < sq\nwhich shrinks if q \u2192 0. But inside this window RDE is\nmuch stronger than NDE so the later can be neglected\nin this window.\nThe sign of x-component of NDE depends on polarization. This contradicts to a simple assumption according\nto which the current is mainly determined by kicks which\nphotons give to electrons. The origin of this difference is\nthe dependence of the directional diagram on the small\nwave vector q via the parameter aij : at some polarizations electrons prefer to be excited in opposite direction\nto q. This explains the change of sign.\nFig. 3 demonstrates the dependence of RDE current\ncomponents on the frequency in the window |\u03c9 \u2212 2\u01ebF | <\nsq where RDE exists. The current vanishes at the edges\nof the window. The component jx is larger for the polarization along the y axis.

At the same\ntime, quick relaxation of excited electrons (holes) to the\nFermi energy due to electron-electron interaction (described by e-e relaxation time \u03c4ee ) conserves their momenta up to the moment when excitations reaches the\ntemperature layer. This results in equality of holes and\nelectrons contributions to the current. And vice versa,\nelectron-phonon relaxation can cancel the hole contribution if \u03c4e\u2212ph \u226a \u03c4ee , where \u03c4e\u2212ph is the time of energy\nrelaxation due to electron-phonon collisions. Thus, the\nobtained current should be multiplied by a factor 2 in\nthe case of quick e-e relaxation and be kept unchanged\nin the opposite case. We note, that when the Fermi energy tends to zero the system becomes symmetric.\nThe RDE exists in a narrow energy range \u2206\u01eb \u2248 ~sq \u2248\n~\u03c9s/c near the Fermi energy. This means that the RDE\nis visible for temperature T < \u2206\u01eb. For photons with\n~\u03c9 = 0.1eV this gives T < 3K.\nThe observation of the resonant photon drag in monolayer graphene is accessible to the modern experimental\ntechnique that allows to investigate interesting aspects of\ncoupling between photons and electrons in this material.\n\nWe have studied the electron contribution to the photon drag current. In fact, in the considered system\nthe hole contribution also presents. The symmetry between holes and electrons in a neutral system means that\nthese contributions double. However, the result will be\nchanged if to take into account the difference between\nelectrons and holes caused by their different excitation\nenergy: while electrons are generated near the Fermi energy the holes appear well below the Fermi energy. This\nleads to a strong difference between the relaxation times.\n\nWe thank A.D.Chepelianskii for useful discussions.\nThe work was supported by grant of RFBR No 08-0200506 and No 08-02-00152 and ANR France PNANO\ngrant NANOTERRA; MVE and LIM thank Laboratoire\nde Physique Th\u00e9orique, CNRS for hospitality during the\nperiod of this work.\n\n[1] P.R.
