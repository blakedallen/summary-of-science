A general method for generation of quantum coherence\nthrough interference-induced state selection is introduced and then applied to 'simple' atomic systems under two-photon transitions, with applications in quantum optics and laser cooling.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nQuantum mechanics, as it is described by the Schr\u00f6dinger's equation, presents\nthe striking feature of imposing a statistical description even for a lone particle.\nHowever, when one deals with large amounts of quantum particles, as is the case\nin most experiments, this fundamental quantum aspect is generally washed out.\nStatistics of identical quantum particles is still different from classical statistics:\nidentical particles behave as bosons or fermions, i.e. they do not obey Boltzmann's law. Still, if one deals with complex systems, like atoms, having a large\nnumber of eigenstates, at temperatures that are large compared to the typical\nenergy interval between the eigenstates (i.e. for low occupation numbers) this\naspect is also erased, as both Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac statistics tend to\nBoltzmann's law. Even then quantum behavior can differ from classical behavior, because the amplitudes of probability appearing in Schr\u00f6dinger equation\nare complex, and thus have a phase: Quantum amplitudes can interfere.\nThe global phase of a quantum state cannot be measured directly (otherwise\nquantum mechanics would not be invariant under a change of the zero of energy),\nbut relative phases can, and are, observed in quantum interference experiments.\n\n1\n\n\fThe linearity of Schr\u00f6dinger's equation insures that linear superpositions of solutions are also solutions. Probabilities calculated for such superpositions are\nsensitive the relative phase of the states forming the superposition, and produce quantum interference patterns. The name 'coherent state' is thus justified\nfor such states as well as the name of 'quantum coherence' for the associated\nproperty. Formally, the quantum coherence of a system corresponds to the nondiagonal elements of the density operator. This definition can be extended to\nsystems mixing quantum and classical statistics, and puts into evidence the fact\nthat coherence is a base-dependent concept.\nQuantum coherence is a sine qua non condition for the observation of quantum interference, which in turn is one of the most common ways of generating\n'nonclassical' effects, like light-noise squeezing or quantum beats. Interestingly\nenough, quantum coherence is also essential in producing \"classical\" states like\nthe coherent states of the electromagnetic field.\nIn the present paper we shall somewhat turn the quantum interference problem upside down: can quantum interference generate 'non-trivial' types of quantum coherence? After describing a general method for generating quantum coherence by using quantum interference, we shall illustrate this main idea with\na few simple examples. We shall concentrate the discussion on the physical\nmechanisms, detailed quantitative approaches can be found in the references.\n\n2\n\nGenerating quantum coherence with quantum\ninterference\n\nThe method we consider here is discussed in detail in ref. [1]. The generation\nof coherence relies on the state selectiveness of the quantum interference. In\norder to illustrate the principle, consider a system with two degrees of freedom.\nThe first ('internal') degree of freedom corresponds to two levels |gi and |si,\nwhereas the second one is associated with states |qi that can be discrete or\ncontinuous. We suppose that a perturbation couples the states |g, qg i to the\nstates |s, qs i in an irreversible way, and that the relative phase of such states\ndepends on the parameter q, so that the quantum interference can be 'tuned'\nto produce complete destructive interference\nP for some value qg = q0 . If the\ninitial state of the system is of the form\nq aq (0)|g, qi, under the action of\nthe coupling perturbation the terms in the sum with q 6= q0 will progressively\nperform transitions to the corresponding states |s, qi, so that the overall state\nof the system after a time t has elapsed is:\nX\n[aq (t)|g, qi + bq (t)|s, qi] .\n(1)\nq\n\nAs t increases, aq (t) becomes more and more concentrated around q = q0 ,\nwhereas bq (t) will present a more and more pronounced 'hole' around q = q0 , as\n2\n\n\fshown schematically in Fig. 1. The final state shall thus asymptotically tend to\nX\nbq |s, qi.\n(2)\naq0 |g, q0 i +\nq6=q0\n\nClearly, the evolution due to the perturbation has generated an entangled state\nof the two degrees of freedom by selection of the q = q0 value. Suppose one performs at large enough time t a measurement of the internal state corresponding\nto the firstPdegree of freedom and founds |gi. The system is then projected onto\nthe state q aq (t)|g, qi, which means that the probability of finding the system\nin the state |q0 i is very close to one (cf. Fig. 1). However,\nP the probability of\ngetting the state |gi as the result of the measurement is q |aq (t)|2 which tends\nto zero as t increases. This 'depopulation' effect is the main limitation of the\npresent method: the sharper the selection, the smaller the probability of getting\nthe 'good' state selection. We shall consider in section 4 methods for controlling\nthe depopulation of the selected states.\nIn discussing specific examples in the following sections, we shall work essentially with the 'diamond' level scheme shown in Fig. 2. A quantum object\ncalled 'the atom' has four 'internal' states. States |gi and |si are coupled by\na two-photon transition via two different intermediate states |e1,2 i. A mode\nof the electromagnetic field labeled 1 (resp. 2) couples the ground state to\nthe intermediate state |e1 i (resp. |e2 i), and the intermediate state |e2 i (resp.\n|e1 i) to the excited state |si. Whether the excited state is a discrete state, a\nband, a continuum, or even a discrete state coupled itself to a continuum is not\nimportant here.\nThe excited state is connected to the ground state by two indistinguishable\npaths, which leads to quantum interference. Using second order perturbation,\nthe transition rate can be written as:\nW =\n\nn1 n2 A1\nA2\n+ \u2032\n2\n\u2032\n\u03b41\n\u03b42\nh\u0304\n\n2\n\n(3)\n\nwhere \u03b4i\u2032 is the effective detuning of the intermediate levels, which might take\ninto account Doppler effect and/or light-shift effects, and n1,2 are the photon\nnumber in each mode. The most general expression for the detuning we shall\nconsider in the following is\n\u03b4i\u2032 = \u03b4i + \u03b2ii ni + \u03b2ij nj + ki v\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03b2ij are light-shift coefficients (that can be easily calculated from perturbation theory), ki is the wavenumber of mode i, and v the center of mass\nvelocity. The light-shift and the Doppler effect play here the role of a 'coupling'\nbetween degrees of freedom linking the internal atomic state respectively to the\nelectromagnetic field and to the center of mass motion.\nEq. (3) vanishes if\nA1 \u03b42\u2032 = \u2212A2 \u03b41\u2032 .\n(5)\n3\n\n\fThe system parameters (n1 , n2 or v) appear in the expression of the detunings \u03b4i\u2032 .\nThe above interference condition can thus be satisfied only for particular values\nof such parameters, and the corresponding state will be selected, as discussed\nabove. Note however that it is not always possible to satisfy the interference\ncondition, for example if the amplitudes A1,2 have different complex phases.\nThis is the principle of the method of quantum coherence generation we shall\napply to specific examples in the following of the paper.\n\n3\n\nGeneration of two-mode coherence\n\nLet us now consider the case in which the light-shift coupling between the internal state and the field modes creates quantum coherence between the latter.\nWe neglect the Doppler effect compared to the light-shifts in Eq. (4). The\ndestructive interference condition deduced from Eqs. (4) and (5) is:\nn2 = \u03b1n1 + \u03bc\nwhere\n\nA1 \u03b222 + A2 \u03b212\nA1 \u03b221 + A2 \u03b222\n\n(7)\n\nA1 \u03b42 + A2 \u03b41\n.\nA1 \u03b221 + A2 \u03b222\n\n(8)\n\n\u03b1=\u2212\n\u03bc=\u2212\n\n(6)\n\nThe condition for applying the above equations is that n2 \u2265 0, which means\nthat the detunings must be chosen in the appropriate way (as the amplitudes\nAi , the detunings \u03b4i and the light-shift coefficients \u03b2ij can be negative, this\ncondition is, in general, not too hard to satisfy).\nIn order to simplify the notation, we take A1 = \u2212A2 \u2261 A. We suppose that\nthe modes are initially (t = t0 ) in uncorrelated states. The initial state of the\nsystem can thus be written in the quite general form:\nX\n|\u03c80 i =\na(n1 , n2 )|g; n1 , n2 i\n(9)\nn1 ,n2\n\nBecause of the coupling with the level |si, the population of each term in the\nabove initial state decays with a ratio given by Eq. (3). If we consider the\nsystem's wave function |\u03c8(t)i at a latter time tf , and project it onto the internal\nstate |gi we obtain:\nX\nexp[\u2212W (n1 , n2 )t]a(n1 , n2 )|g; n1 , n2 i\n(10)\nhg|\u03c8(tf )i =\nn1 ,n2\n\nClearly, for sufficiently large values of tf , only the terms for which the interference condition Eq. (6) is satisfied, such that W (n1 , n2 )t \u226a 1 will survive.\nQuantum interference has performed state selectiveness, and the internal ground\n4\n\n\fstate |gi has become entangled with a particular combination of photon numbers\nin modes 1 and 2.\nIn order to quantify this entanglement, consider the quantity \u03b4n \u2261 n2 \u2212\n(\u03b1n1 +\u03bc). The fluctuations of \u03b4n, h\u03b4n2 i\u2212h\u03b4ni2 , constitute a measurement of the\ndegree of correlation between the two modes. If the two mode are independent,\nthe fluctuation of \u03b4n is the sum of the fluctuations of each mode. As the modes\nbecome correlated, this quantity should go to zero. Let us thus suppose that at\ntime tf one performs a measurement of the atomic state; if the result is |gi we\nmeasure the degree of coherence defined by the quantity:\n\u0012\n\u0013\nh\u03b4n2 (tf )i \u2212 h\u03b4n(tf )i2\nR = 10 log10\n.\n(11)\nh\u03b4n2 (t0 )i \u2212 h\u03b4n(t0 )i2\nThe smaller R, the greater the degree of correlation. Physically, one can interpret R as the quantum noise reduction in the measurement of the quantity\n\u03b4n with respect to the 'standard limit' corresponding to uncorrelated modes.\nFig. 3 shows the time evolution of the quantity R for three combinations of\n(\u03b1, r) where r \u2261 hn2 i/hn1 i is the ratio of the mean photon numbers in modes 2\nand 1. We took \u03bc = 0. The two modes are initially in coherent states. Some\ninteresting features of this result can be understood in terms of rather simple\narguments.\nThe first observation is that the degree of coherence increases when \u03b1 increases. As the initial coherent state contains the vacuum state, there is a finite\nprobability of finding zero photons in one of the field modes. Zero photons\nobviously means no transition and consequently no generation of coherence:\nThe coherence is so to say 'contaminated' by the vacuum state. The probability of this 'vacuum tail' for coherent states decreases exponentially with the\nmean photon number, so that higher values of \u03b1 correspond to higher degrees\nof coherence.\nA second interesting feature of the result is that the degree of coherence is\nmaximum for r = \u03b1. This is a consequence of the filtering character of the\nprocess: The weight of the filtered state in the final overall state is proportional\nto the weight of the filtered state in the initial overall state. This means that\nthe final population of the state |n1 , \u03b1n1 i in the final state is proportional to the\nweights of the states |n1 i and |n2 = \u03b1n1 i in the initial state, that are maxima\nif hn2 i \u2248 \u03b1hn1 i [1].\nLet us finally mention that the present method can generate 'unusual' types\nof correlations between the field modes, as the following examples show. For \u03b1 =\n1 and \u03bc = 0 one generates the usual kind of correlation obtained in parametric\ndown conversion (that is, n1 = n2 ). If \u03b1 < 0 and \u03bc \u2265 |\u03b1| one should have\nn1 \u2264 \u03bc/|\u03b1| and n2 \u2264 \u03bc, and the resulting state is a finite superposition of\nnumber states in each mode. In particular, for \u03bc = |\u03b1| = 1 one should generate\na one-photon number state in each mode. If \u03b1n1 \u226a \u03bc the final state tends to\nthe number state n2 = \u03bc.\n5\n\n\fIf \u03b1 \u226b \u03bc, mode 2 becomes an 'amplified replica' of mode 1: the quantum\nproperties of mode 1 have been 'cloned' to mode 2, including quantum noise\nproperties [2].\nClosing this section, let us mention that experimental evidence of coherence\ngeneration in systems very similar to the present one has been presented by\nWang, Chen and Elliot [3].\n\n4\n\nAtomic velocity selection\n\nLaser cooling of neutral atoms has been a main issue of atomic physics for more\nthen a decade now. Well understood mechanisms like Sisyphus cooling currently allows to achieve temperatures close to the so-called 'recoil limit'. This\nlimit corresponds to the fact that, if the average momentum transmitted to the\natom by spontaneously emitted photons is zero, the root mean square value of\nthis momentum shift is equal to the momentum h\u0304k of the photon. This sets a\nminimum energy achievable by any cooling method involving spontaneous emission to Er = h\u03042 k 2 /2M (M is the mass of the atom), called 'recoil energy', to\nwhich one associates the 'recoil temperature' Tr = h\u03042 k 2 /M kB (kB is the Boltzmann's constant). Nevertheless, it has been demonstrated that by preventing\nlow-velocity atoms from absorbing photons it is possible achieve 'subrecoil' temperatures. Two such methods have been experimentally demonstrated: VSCPT\n(Velocity Selection by Coherent Population Trapping) [4] and Raman cooling [5].\nVSCPT relies on the possibility of generating ground-state coherences which,\nfor particular values of the atomic momentum, are uncoupled to the electromagnetic radiation due to a quantum interference effect [6]. Once the atom attains\na low enough momentum, it is trapped in this momentum-defined coherent superposition and do not undergo further fluorescence cycles. We shall discuss\nRaman cooling in more detail in the next section.\nThe general method described in Sec. 2 can be applied to the generation of\ncoherence between the internal and external (center of mass motion) degrees of\nfreedom of an atom. By performing a measurement of the internal state, very\nsharp atomic velocity selection is possible. The coupling between the degree\nof freedom is provided by the Doppler effect. The process does not involve\nspontaneous emission and in principle is not limited by the recoil energy.\nWith counterpropagating laser beams of the same frequency, the destructive\ninterference condition can be tuned to the velocity class v by choosing (we\nneglect light-shift terms)\nA1 \u03b42 + A2 \u03b41\n(12)\nv=\n(A2 \u2212 A1 )k\nwhere we supposed that A1 6= A2 (otherwise destructive interference can not be\nachieved).\nParalleling the reasoning of the preceding section, we can write the initial\n\n6\n\n\fwave function of the system as\n|\u03c80 i =\n\nZ\n\ndv f (v) |g; v > .\n\n(13)\n\nThe transition rate W (v) now depends on the velocity v via the detunings\n\u2032\n\u03b41,2\n= \u03b41,2 \u00b1 kv, so that the projection of the asymptotic wave function over the\ninternal state |gi can be written:\nZ\n|\u03c8(t)i = dv f (v) exp[\u2212W (v)tf ] |g; v > ,\n(14)\nand, again, only velocity states such that W (v)tf \u226a 1 survive.\nThe present case presents however a complication. Referring to Fig. 2, one\nsees that one must also take into account the 'stray' transition in which the atom\nabsorbs one photon, goes to one of the intermediate levels and then decays back\nto the ground state by spontaneous emission. With a negative detuning, this\nprocess is the usual Doppler cooling whose equilibrium temperature is generally\nmuch larger then the recoil temperature. Thus, for the temperatures below the\nDoppler temperature which we are aiming to achieve, the 'stray' process heats\nthe atoms, and competes with the velocity selection induced by the two-photon\ntransitions. Let us just say here that it is possible, within some reasonable\nassumptions, to write a Fokker-Planck equation describing both one- and twophoton process (for details, see ref. [7]), from which the following conclusions\ncan be drawn.\nFig. 4 shows the equilibrium temperature as a function of the two-photon\ntransition rate. The excited level is supposed to be a continuum so that the\ntwo-photon transitions correspond to an irreversible ionization process. The\nirreversibility implies that atoms are lost as they are ionized and that the number\nof cooled atoms decreases along the selection process. It is shown in ref. [7]\nthat the remaining ground-state population is proportional to (T /TD )1/2 . This\nbrings about the discussion of the main limitation of the present method, namely\nthe fact that any generation of coherence by state selection 'looses' a fraction\nof atoms that becomes larger as the selection becomes sharper. There are (at\nleast) two ways to prevent or limit this undesirable effect, that we discuss now.\nThe first way of preventing depopulation is to inject into the system 'new'\natoms in the ground state. One can then achieve an equilibrium regime in which\nthe final selected state population is constant. It is shown in ref. [7] this scheme\ncan produce, within experimentally realistic conditions, a significant increasing\nof the phase space density.\nThe second way to prevent depopulation is to 'recycle' the atoms lost in the\nselection process. For example, one can take a discrete excited level in Fig. 2 and\nlet the atoms spontaneously decay back to the ground state. However, in atomic\nsystems selection rules forbid the one-photon decay between states coupled by\ntwo-photon transitions. The allowed two-photon decay is considerably slower,\n7\n\n\fthus reducing the efficiency of the selection process. A more convenient solution\nis to 'fold' the level scheme presented in Fig. 2 in such a way that the excited\nlevel becomes in fact a ground state hyperfine sublevel (see Fig. 5). We shall\ndiscuss such a system in the next section.\n\n5\n\nRaman cooling using quantum interference\n\nExcept in the subrecoil regime, the principle of Raman cooling is quite similar\nto Doppler cooling. A two-photon, Raman stimulated transition connects one\nground-state sublevel to another (Fig. 5). A laser beam is used to excite a\nvirtual intermediate level, and another beam, whose frequency differs from the\nfirst one by a value very close to the frequency interval between the two groundstate sublevel, brings the atoms to other substate by stimulated emission. As\nspontaneous emission is not involved in the process, the momentum transfer\nto the atoms is perfectly controlled: if the two beams are counterpropagating,\nthe atomic momentum changes by 2h\u0304k in the process. Cooling is performed\nby periodically exchanging the direction of the beams (or by adding two extra\nRaman beams [8]). Choosing a negative value for the Raman detuning \u03b40 favors\nthe transition that cool the atoms [5] (exactly as in Doppler cooling). However,\nonce the atom arrives in the second ground-state sublevel, it must be bought\nback to first one in order to allow the cooling process to proceed. This is done\nby 'repumping' the atoms with a beam resonant with the transition between\nthe second ground-state sublevel |f i and the excited state. Once in the excited\nstate, the atom has a chance of decaying to the initial ground-state sublevel |gi\n(if the atom decays to the sublevel |f i, it will eventually be excited again, so\nall atoms are finally 'repumped' to the sublevel |gi). As the repumping process\nrandomizes the atomic velocity around the recoil velocity, as described above,\nRaman cooling cannot attain subrecoil temperatures.\nTo achieve the subrecoil regime, one should prevent cold enough atoms from\nperforming Raman transitions. An atom of velocity v sees an effective Raman\ndetuning shifted by 2kv. Using pulsed Raman excitation whose spectrum is\nbuilded such that it presents a zero for v = 0, it is possible to decouple atoms\nof low enough velocity from the Raman process: Atoms within a certain range\n\u2206v around v = 0 are not excited. As Raman transitions are very sharp, one can\nhave \u2206v \u226a vr . Once cooled to around the recoil velocity by the Doppler-like\nprocess, the atoms perform random walks in the velocity space until they fall\ninto this range, where they remain trapped, and the number of trapped atoms\nincreases as the cooling process goes on [5].\nWe propose an alternative method that uses quantum interference instead\nof spectrally shaped pulses to prevent subrecoil atoms from being excited, thus\nallowing continuous-wave excitation. Although hydrogen is not the most interesting atomic species in the present context, we shall consider here Raman\ntransitions among the hyperfine sublevels of the ground state of this atom, be8\n\n\fcause exact expressions for its dipole matrix elements are known, allowing the\ncalculation of the transition rate to be easily performed [8]. Referring to Fig. 5,\nwe can generalize Eq. (3) for hydrogen\nX An\nQ = Q0\n(15)\n1\n\u2212 n12\nn q2\nwhere we have used the fact that the hydrogen energy levels scales as 1/n2\n(n integer) and have defined q \u2261 [Ry/(h\u0304\u03c91 )]1/2 (Ry = 2.2 \u00d7 10\u221218 J is the\nRydberg). The Raman transitions amplitude is obtained by summing over all\npossible intermediate levels |ei i. This means that it can be possible, at least\nin particular cases, to choose the frequency of the Raman beams in order to\nproduce destructive quantum interference among the contributions of the intermediate levels. The result of the calculation outlined above is presented in Fig. 6\nand shows a clear pattern of resonances (corresponding to the usual resonances\nof the hydrogen atom) and of 'antiresonances' or 'dark' resonances, the latter\ncorresponding to complete destructive interference. As Doppler effect displaces\nthe position of the antiresonances, an adequate tuning the Raman beams can\nprevent subrecoil atoms from performing Raman transitions, thus decoupling\nzero-velocity atoms from the Raman process, which allows subrecoil cooling.\nAn interesting example of the particular dynamics of an atom under subrecoil\ncooling with quantum interference is presented in Fig. 7, showing the typical\ntime evolution of the atomic velocity. It can be seen that once trapped in a\nlow-velocity state, the atom stays there for almost the entire duration of the\nevolution. The statistics of the velocity states is dominated by a single state:\nThis is the signature of a very special and interesting behavior known as 'Levy\nflights', which always manifests itself in subrecoil cooling [9].\nThe present method allows continuous-wave Raman subrecoil cooling, and,\nas the atoms can be recycled in the same way as in the usual pulsed Raman\ncooling, it performs subrecoil cooling without populations losses. In other words,\nit performs cooling instead of simply velocity selection, the repumping process\ninsuring the dissipation necessary to the cooling process.\n\n6\n\nConclusion\n\nWe have presented in a unified way a method for generation of quantum coherence though controlled state selection based on quantum interference. The\napplication of the method to concrete examples has been discussed, concerning\nthe generation of coherence among modes of the electromagnetic field and atomic\nvelocity selection, in a variety of situations. Together with many other applications of quantum interference such as Velocity Selection by Coherent Population\nTrapping and Electromagnetically Induced Transparency, the present method\nillustrates the power of quantum interference as a tool for the manipulation of\nquantum entities.\n9\n\n\f7\n\nAcknowledgments\n\nThe author thanks D.
