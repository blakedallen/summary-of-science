M. P. Carmelo\nGCEP-Center of Physics, University of Minho, Campus Gualtar, P-4710-057 Braga, Portugal\n(Dated: 22 November 2002)\nIn this paper we describe the pseudoparticles, holons, and spinons whose occupancy configurations\ndescribe the energy eigenstates of the one-dimensional (1D) Hubbard model in terms of rotated electrons. Rotated electrons are related to electrons by a mere unitary transformation such that rotated\nelectron double occupation is a good quantum number and the effective electronic lattice occupied\nby rotated electrons is identical to the real-space lattice occupied by electrons. Moreover, we find\nthat the band-momentum pseudoparticle description associated with the Bethe-ansatz Takahasi's\nthermodynamic equations is related by Fourier transform to a local pseudoparticle representation in\nterms of occupancy configurations of spatial coordinates. Such spatial coordinates correspond to an\neffective pseudoparticle lattice. There is an effective pseudoparticle lattice for each pseudoparticle\nbranch with finite occupancy in a given state. This description introduces the local pseudoparticles whose spatial coordinate is the conjugate of the band momentum. We describe the energy\neigenstates in terms of local pseudoparticle site distribution configurations in such lattices. Moreover, we relate both the local pseudoparticle internal structure and the latter configurations to the\nrotated-electron site distribution configurations which describe the energy eigenstates. The electron\n- rotated-electron unitary transformation is such that the latter configurations are independent of\nthe value of the on-site Coulombian repulsion. Our findings provide useful information about the\nrelation of the exotic pseudoparticles, holons, and spinons that diagonalize the non-perturbative\nmany-electron problem to the original electrons.

In this context one-dimensional\n(1D) systems are of special interest, essentially stimulated by theoretical predictions like charge-spin separation for\nthe 1D Hubbard model [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. While the 1D Hubbard model [6, 7, 8, 9, 10] is the prototype of an exactly\nsolvable model for correlated electrons, such a charge-spin separation corresponds to the description of the energy\neigenstates in terms of occupancy configurations of holons and spinons. Recently the charge-spin separation of that\nmodel was shown to occur for all values of excitation energy, the corresponding holon and spinon description being extended to the complete set of energy eigenstates which span the Hilbert space [11, 12, 13]. On the other\nhand, quasi-1D materials are ideal model systems which allow the study of basic physical concepts in one dimension. In the last years there has been a renewed interest on the unconventional spectral properties of these materials\n[14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34]. Moreover, recent angle-resolved\nultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy revealed very similar spectral fingerprints from both high-Tc superconductors\nand quasi-1D compounds [15]. The similarity of the ultraviolet data for these two different systems could be evidence\nof the occurrence of the above mentioned charge-spin separation associated with holons and spinons. The anomalous\ntemperature dependence of the spectral function could also indicate a dimensional crossover [15, 35, 36, 37]. The\nresults of Refs. [38, 39] also suggest that the unconventional spectral properties observed in two-dimensional (2D)\nmaterials could have a 1D origin. Thus the holons and spinons could play an important role in spectral properties of\nboth 1D and 2D low-dimensional materials.\nRecently it was found that for the 1D Hubbard model there are exact selection rules which limit the number of\nholons and spinons created by application of rotated electron operators onto any eigenstate of the spin \u03c3 electron\nnumber [13]. The concept of rotated electron is associated with a unitary transformation introduced in Ref. [40].\nFor such rotated electrons double occupation is a good quantum number for all values of the on-site Coulombian\nrepulsion U . In order to distinguish the rotated-electron description from the electron representation, the concept of\neffective electronic lattice was introduced [13]. It is such that rotated electrons occupy the effective electronic lattice,\nwhereas electrons occupy the real-space lattice. However, these lattices are identical, having the same lattice constant\na and length L = a Na , where Na designates the number of sites. The occurrence of rotated electrons leads to clear\nfinger prints in the few-electron spectral properties. Indeed, the few-electron spectral functions include several upper\n\n\f2\nHubbard bands corresponding to different and separated energy scales. The Drth band is spanned by excited states of\nrotated-electron double occupation Dr . However, in general only the first few upper bands have a significant amount\nof spectral weight. Although the above-mentioned selection rules refer to rotated-electron operators, their existence\ninduces restrictions in the numbers of holons, spinons, and pseudoparticles contained in few-electron excitations. For\ninstance, according to the results found in Ref. [13], about 99% of the upper Hubbard band spectral weight of the\none-electron addition spectral function corresponds to the first upper Hubbard band. Interestingly, rotated electron\ndouble occupation Dr equals the number of holons of \u03b7 spin projection \u22121/2 and charge \u22122e. Here \u2212e denotes the\nelectronic charge and the \u03b7 spin is a SU (2) algebra associated with the charge degrees of freedom [41, 42]. The charge\n\u22122e and +2e holons refer to all values of the on-site Coulomb repulsion U and are related to the large U dublons and\nholons respectively, studied in Ref. [43].\nThe related to the electron - rotated electron unitary transformation is part of the non-perturbative diagonalization\nof the quantum problem. Through out this paper the designation rotated-electron site distribution configuration (and\nelectron site distribution configuration) refers to the effective electronic lattice (and real-space lattice). A property of\ndeep physical meaning is that the energy eigenstates are described by the the same rotated-electron site distribution\nconfigurations for all values of U/t, where t is the first-neighbor transfer integral. This is in contrast to the complex\nelectron site distribution configurations of these states, which change upon variations of the value of the on-site\nrepulsion. Fortunately, the electron - rotated electron unitary transformation becomes the unit transformation as\nU/t \u2192 \u221e. Thus one can reach the U/t independent rotated-electron site distribution configurations which describe the\nenergy eigenstates by studying the corresponding electron site distribution configurations for the 1D Hubbard model in\nthe limit U/t \u2192 \u221e. In the present paper we study such U/t independent rotated electron configurations. In part, this is\nachieved by considering the corresponding problem of the electron real-space lattice charge (and spin) sequences which\ndescribe the energy eigenstates of the 1D Hubbard model in the limit U/t \u2192 \u221e. The problem of the 1D Hubbard model\nin the limit of U/t \u2192 \u221e has been previously studied by many authors [2, 3, 4, 5, 40, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52].\nIn such a limit there is a huge degeneracy of \u03b7-spin and spin occupancy configurations. Thus there are several\nchoices for complete sets of energy eigenstates with the same energy and momentum spectra. However, only one of\nthese choices is associated with the rotated-electron site distribution configurations reached by the electron - rotated\nelectron canonical unitary transformation. It refers to the complete set of energy eigenstates generated from the\ncorresponding energy eigenstates of the 1D Hubbard model for finite values of U/t by turning off adiabatically the\nparameter t/U . We call the obtained set of states of the model band-momentum energy eigenstates. The electron\noccupancy configurations which describe these states have not been studied so far. In addition to study this problem,\nin this paper we discuss the relation of the obtained states to an alternative choice of energy eigenstates whose electron\nsite distribution configurations were studied in Ref. [51].\nConcerning the open questions whose clarification our results are useful for, one should mention the evaluation of\nfew-electron spectral functions for finite values of excitation energy. Except in the limit U/t \u2192 \u221e [3, 4, 5], this is an\nimportant open problem of interest for the further understanding of the unconventional spectral properties observed in\nlow-dimensional materials. The relationship of the pseudoparticles, holons, and spinons to the electrons is a complex\nproblem of crucial importance for the evaluation of these spectral functions. As discussed in later sections, the concepts\nof local pseudoparticle and effective pseudoparticle lattices introduced in this paper, as well as the relationship of the\nenergy-eigenstate pseudoparticle occupancy configurations in these effective lattices to the rotated-electron occupancy\nconfigurations, provide useful information about such a relationship. As open questions are concerned, we emphasize\nthat the studies of this paper are a necessary step and a valuable contribution for the evaluation of the overlap between\nfew-electron excitations and energy eigenstates, as further discussed in Sec. VI. Elsewhere the tools and concepts\nintroduced in this paper are used in the study of few-electron spectral distributions for finite values of momentum\nand excitation energy [53, 54]. Importantly, predictions obtained recently by application of a preliminary version of\nthe theory introduced in this paper and in Refs. [53, 54] seem to describe both qualitatively and quantitatively the\none-electron removal spectral lines observed in real quasi-1D materials by photoemission experiments for finite values\nof the excitation energy [55].\nThe paper is organized as follows: In Sec. II we introduce the 1D Hubbard model and summarize the concept of\nrotated electron as well as the description of the model in terms of holons, spinons, and pseudoparticles. In Sec. III\nwe introduce the complete set of energy eigenstates of the 1D Hubbard model in the limit U/t \u2192 \u221e which refers\nto the electron - rotated electron canonical unitary transformation. This includes the introduction of a set of basic\nproperties which turn out to be useful for finding the internal structure of the local \u03b1, \u03bd pseudoparticle, which is one\nof the subjects of Sec. IV. In Sec. IV we introduce a complete basis of local states which we express in terms of\nrotated-electron local charge, spin, and c pseudoparticle sequences. In that section we also find the rotated-electron\nsite distribution configurations which describe the internal structure of the local \u03b1, \u03bd pseudoparticle. The local c\npseudoparticle and \u03b1, \u03bd pseudoparticle effective lattices are introduced in Sec. V. In that section we also express\nthe energy eigenstates in terms of the Fourier-transform superpositions of local charge, spin, and c pseudoparticle\nsequences introduced in the previous section. A pratical application of the derived local pseudoparticle representation\n\n\f3\nis given in Sec. VI. Finally, in Sec. VII we present the concluding remarks.\nII.\n\nTHE 1D HUBBARD MODEL, ROTATED ELECTRONS, AND SUMMARY OF THE\nPSEUDOPARTICLE, HOLON, AND SPINON DESCRIPTION\n\nIn this section we introduce the model used in our studies. In addition, we discuss the concept of rotated electron\nand summarize some basic information about the pseudoparticle, holon, and spinon description which is useful for\nthe studies of this paper.\nA.\n\nTHE MODEL\n\nIn a chemical potential \u03bc and magnetic field H the 1D Hubbard Hamiltonian can be written as,\n\u0124 = \u0124SO(4) +\n\nX\n\n\u03bc\u03b1 \u015cz\u03b1\n\n(1)\n\n\u03b1\n\nwhere the Hamiltonian,\n\u0124SO(4) = \u0124H \u2212 (U/2) N\u0302 + (U/4) Na ,\n\n(2)\n\n\u0124H = T\u0302 + U D\u0302 ,\n\n(3)\n\nhas SO(4) symmetry [41, 42, 56] and\n\nis the simple Hubbard model.

In the latter expressions N\u0302 = \u03c3 N\u0302\u03c3 is the electron number operator and the\noperator N\u0302\u03c3 counts the number of spin \u03c3 electrons and is given in Eq. (6). We denote by N\u2191 and N\u2193 the number\nof spin-up electrons and spin-down electrons respectively, and by N = N\u2191 + N\u2193 the number of electrons. The lattice\nconstant is denoted by a and thus the length of the system is L = Na a. We consider electronic densities and the\nspin densities given by n = n\u2191 + n\u2193 and m = n\u2191 \u2212 n\u2193 respectively, where n\u03c3 = N\u03c3 /L and n = N/L. These densities\n\n\f4\nand spin densities belong to the domains defined by the following inequalities 0 \u2264 n \u2264 1/a ; 1/a \u2264 n \u2264 2/a and\n\u2212n \u2264 m \u2264 n ; \u2212(2/a \u2212 n) \u2264 m \u2264 (2/a \u2212 n) respectively.\nThe Hamiltonian \u0124SO(4) defined in Eq. (2) commutes with the six generators of the \u03b7-spin Sc and spin Ss algebras\n[41, 42, 56]. While the expressions of the diagonal generators were provided above, the off-diagonal generators of\nthese two algebras read,\nX\n\nc\n\u015c+\n=\n\n(\u22121)j c\u2020j, \u2193 c\u2020j, \u2191 ;\n\nc\n\u015c\u2212\n=\n\nX\n\n(\u22121)j cj, \u2191 cj, \u2193 ,\n\n(7)\n\nX\n\nc\u2020j, \u2191 cj, \u2193 ,\n\n(8)\n\nj\n\nj\n\nand\ns\n\u015c+\n=\n\nX\n\nc\u2020j, \u2193 cj, \u2191 ;\n\ns\n\u015c\u2212\n=\n\nj\n\nj\n\nrespectively. We note that the Bethe-ansatz solution of the 1D Hubbard model refers to the Hilbert subspace spanned\nby the lowest-weight states (LWSs) of the \u03b7-spin and spin algebras, i.e. such that S \u03b1 = \u2212Sz\u03b1 [56].\nFinally, the momentum operator is given by,\nN\n\nP\u0302 = \u2212\n\na h\ni\ni XX\nc\u2020j, \u03c3 cj+1, \u03c3 \u2212 c\u2020j+1, \u03c3 cj, \u03c3 ,\n2 \u03c3 j=1\n\n(9)\n\nand commutes with the Hamiltonians introduced in Eqs. (1) and (2).\nB.\n\nROTATED ELECTRON OPERATORS\n\nRotated electrons are associated with a unitary transformation first introduced by Harris and Lange [40, 47]. Such\na transformation plays a key role in the expression of the holon and spinon number operators in terms of electronic\noperators for the whole parameter space of the model [13]. The electron operators that occur in the 1D Hubbard\nmodel (1) and (3) are defined by c\u2020j, \u03c3 , while the rotated electron operator c\u0303\u2020j, \u03c3 is given by,\nc\u0303\u2020j, \u03c3 = V\u0302 \u2020 (U/t) c\u2020j, \u03c3 V\u0302 (U/t) ,\n\n(10)\n\nwhere V\u0302 (U/t) is the Harris and Lange unitary operator. As mentioned in Sec. I, such rotated electrons conserve\ndouble occupation for all finite values of U/t. The operators V\u0302 \u2020 (U/t) and V\u0302 (U/t) can be written as,\nV\u0302 \u2020 (U/t) = e\u2212\u015c ;\n\nV\u0302 (U/t) = e\u015c .\n\n(11)\n\nThese operators are uniquely defined by the following two equations,\nH\u0303H = V\u0302 \u2020 (U/t) \u0124H V\u0302 (U/t) = \u0124H + [\u0124H , \u015c ] +\n\n1\n[[\u0124H , \u015c ], \u015c ] + ... ,\n2\n\n(12)\n\nand\n[\u0124H , V\u0302 \u2020 (U/t) D\u0302 V\u0302 (U/t)] = [\u0124H , D\u0303] = 0 .\n\n(13)\n\nIn these equations the Hamiltonian \u0124H is given in Eq. (3) and and the rotated-electron double occupation operator\nD\u0303 reads,\nD\u0303 \u2261 V\u0302 \u2020 (U/t) D\u0302 V\u0302 (U/t) =\n\nX\nj\n\nc\u0303\u2020j, \u2191 c\u0303j, \u2191 c\u0303\u2020j, \u2193 c\u0303j, \u2193 ,\n\n(14)\n\n\f5\nwhere D\u0302 is the electron double occupation operator given in Eq. (5). Note that c\u2020j, \u03c3 and c\u0303\u2020j, \u03c3 are only identical in the\nU/t \u2192 \u221e limit where electron double occupation becomes a good quantum number. The expression of any rotated\noperator \u00d5 such that,\n\u00d5 = V\u0302 \u2020 (U/t) \u00d4 V\u0302 (U/t) ,\n\n(15)\n\nin terms of the rotated electron operators c\u0303\u2020j, \u03c3 and c\u0303j, \u03c3 is the same as the expression of the corresponding general\noperator \u00d4 in terms of the electron operators c\u2020j, \u03c3 and cj, \u03c3 respectively. Equations (12) and (13) can be used to derive\nan expression for the unitary operator V\u0302 (U/t) in terms of electronic elementary operators order by order in t/U . The\nauthors of Ref. [47] carried out this expansion up to eighth order (see foot note [12] of that reference).\nOperators which commute with the Harris and Langue unitary operator have the same expressions in terms of both\nelectronic and rotated-electronic operators. Examples of such operators are the six generators of the SU (2) \u03b7-spin\n~ ~\n~ ~\nand spin algebras. Thus it follows that the commutators [V\u0302 (U/t), \u015c \u03b1 .\u015c \u03b1 ] and [V\u0302 (U/t), N\u0302\u03c3 ] vanish, where \u015c c .\u015c c \u2261 ~\u03b7\u0302.\u03b7\u0302~\n~ ~\n~ ~\nand \u015c s .\u015c s \u2261 \u015c.\u015c are the square \u03b7-spin and spin operators respectively, and N\u0302\u03c3 is the spin \u03c3 electron number operator\n(6). The Harris and Langue unitary operator also commutes with the momentum operator (9).\nC.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE PSEUDOPARTICLE, HOLON, AND SPINON DESCRIPTION\n\nLet us summarized the aspects of the holon, spinon, and band-momentum pseudoparticle description introduced in\nRef. [11] and further investigated in Refs. [12, 13] which are useful for the studies of this paper. Such a description\nis extracted directly from combination of the Bethe-ansatz Takahashi's thermodynamic equations with the SO(4)\nsymmetry of the model and the symmetries associated with the concept of rotated electron. Indeed, holons, spinons,\nand band-momentum pseudoparticles emerge naturally from the non-perturbative diagonalization of the model. The\nfirst step of such a diagonalization is precisely the Hilbert-space unitary rotation which maps electrons onto rotated\nelectrons and is such that rotated-electron double occupation is a good quantum number. Let us denote by Nc\nthe number of rotated-electron singly occupied sites. Thus the numbers Nc , [N \u2212 Nc ]/2, and [N h \u2212 Nc ]/2 equal\nthe number of rotated-electron singly occupied sites, doubly occupied sites, and empty sites respectively. (Here\nN h = [2Na \u2212 N ].) Importantly, once rotated electron double occupation is a good quantum number also all these\nnumbers are good quantum numbers for all values of U/t. There are precisely Nc c pseudoparticles and Nc spinons.\nThese c pseudoparticles (and spinons) describe the charge part (and spin part) of the Nc rotated electrons which singly\noccupy lattice sites. Thus the charge and spin degrees of freedom of these Nc rotated electrons separate. For each c\npseudoparticle there is a chargeon and a rotated-electronic hole. The chargeon corresponds to the charge part of the\nrotated electron which singly occupies the site. The non-perturbative organization of the electronic degrees of freedom\nassociates the [N \u2212 Nc ] rotated electrons which doubly occupy [N \u2212 Nc ]/2 sites with [N \u2212 Nc ]/2 holons of \u03b7-spin\nprojection \u22121/2. Indeed each rotated-electron doubly occupied site corresponds to a spin singlet rotated electron\npair which is nothing but a \u22121/2 holon. Finally, the [N h \u2212 Nc ]/2 rotated-electron empty sites are nothing but the\n[N h \u2212Nc ]/2 holons of \u03b7-spin projection +1/2. Such an analysis confirms the importance played by the unitary operator\nV\u0302 (U/t) in the description of the quantum objects whose occupancy configurations describe all energy eigenstates of\nthe model.\nLet us summarize some of the properties of the quantum objects which we have briefly related to rotated-electrons\nabove. One should distinguish the total \u03b7 spin (and spin) of the system, which we denote by Sc (and Ss ) and the\ncorresponding \u03b7-spin (and spin) projection, which we denote by Scz (and Ssz ) from the \u03b7 spin (and spin) carried by\nthe elementary quantum objects. We call sc (and ss ) the \u03b7 spin (and spin) carried by the holons, spinons, and\npseudoparticles and \u03c3c (and \u03c3s ) their \u03b7-spin (and spin) projection. The holons are such that sc = 1/2, ss = 0, and\n\u03c3c = \u00b11/2 whereas the spinons have ss = 1/2 and \u03c3s = \u00b11/2. Through out this paper we denote the holons and\nspinons according to their \u00b11/2 \u03b7-spin and spin projections respectively. The \u22121/2 and +1/2 holons have charge\n\u22122e and +2e respectively. It is shown in later sections that the band-momentum c pseudoparticle is associated with\nthe local c pseudoparticle. The latter local quantum object describes the chargeon and the corresponding rotated\nelectronic hole of each rotated-electron singly occupied site. There are also 2\u03bd-holon (and 2\u03bd-spinon) composite c, \u03bd\npseudoparticles (and s, \u03bd pseudoparticles). The c, \u03bd pseudoparticle has sc = 0 and ss = 0 (and the s, \u03bd pseudoparticle\nhas ss = 0 and no charge degrees of freedom) and contains an equal number \u03bd of \u22121/2 and +1/2 \u03b7-spin projection\nholons (and spin projection spinons). The c pseudoparticle has sc = 0 and no spin degrees of freedom. The \u00b11/2\nholons (and \u00b11/2 spinons) which are not part of 2\u03bd-holon composite c, \u03bd pseudoparticles (and 2\u03bd-spinon composite\ns, \u03bd pseudoparticles) are called \u00b11/2 Yang holons (and \u00b11/2 HL spinons). In the designations HL spinon and Yang\n\n\f6\nholon, HL stands for Heilmann and Lieb and Yang refers to C. N. Yang respectively, who are the authors of Refs.\n[41, 42].\nAll energy eigenstates can be specified by the c pseudoparticle band-momentum distribution function Nc (q), by\nthe set of \u03b1, \u03bd pseudoparticle band-momentum distribution functions {N\u03b1, \u03bd (q)} where \u03b1 = c, s and \u03bd = 1, 2, ..., and\nby the set of numbers numbers L\u03b1, \u22121/2 of sc = 1/2, ss = 0, and \u22121/2 Yang holons (\u03b1 = c) and ss = 1/2 and\n\u22121/2 HL spinons (\u03b1 = s). An important concept is that of CPHS ensemble subspace where CP HS stands for c\npseudoparticle, holon, and spinon. This is a Hilbert subspace spanned by all states with fixed values for the \u22121/2\nYang holon number Lc, \u22121/2 , \u22121/2 HL spinon number Ls, \u22121/2 , c pseudoparticle number Nc , and for the sets of \u03b1, \u03bd\npseudoparticle numbers {Nc, \u03bd } and {Ns, \u03bd } corresponding to the \u03bd = 1, 2, 3, ... branches.\nThe variable q appearing in the above distribution functions Nc (q) and {N\u03b1, \u03bd (q)} where \u03b1 = c, s and \u03bd = 1, 2, ...\nis the continuum band momentum associated with the discrete band-momentum values qj which are of the following\nform,\n2\u03c0 c\nI ;\nL j\n2\u03c0 \u03b1, \u03bd\nI\n;\n=\nL j\n\nqj =\nqj\n\nj = 1, ..., Na ,\nj = 1, ..., N\u03b1, \u03bd ;\n\n\u03b1 = c, s ,\n\n\u03bd = 1, 2, ... .\n\n(16)\n\nP\nP\u221e\nThe Ijc numbers are integers (half-odd integers), if N2a \u2212 \u03b1=c,s \u03bd=1 N\u03b1, \u03bd is odd (even) and the Ij\u03b1, \u03bd numbers are\n\u2217\nintegers (half-odd integers), if N\u03b1,\n\u03bd is odd (even). The discrete index j can have the following values j = 1, 2, 3, ..., Na\n\u2217\nand j = 1, 2, 3, ..., N\u03b1, \u03bd for the c and \u03b1, \u03bd pseudoparticles respectively, where the number of lattice sites Na and the\nnumber\n\u2217\nh\nN\u03b1,\n\u03bd = N\u03b1, \u03bd + N\u03b1, \u03bd ,\n\n(17)\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n(18)\n\nwhere\nh\nN\u03b1,\n\u03bd\n\n= L\u03b1 + 2\n\n(\u03bd \u2032 \u2212 \u03bd)N\u03b1, \u03bd \u2032 ,\n\n\u03bd \u2032 =\u03bd+1\n\ngive the total number of corresponding discrete band-momentum values qj . On the right-hand side of Eq. (17) N\u03b1, \u03bd\nh\nand N\u03b1,\n\u03bd are the number of \u03b1, \u03bd pseudoparticles and \u03b1, \u03bd pseudoparticle holes respectively. On the right-hand side of\nEq. (18) L\u03b1 is the number of Yang holons (\u03b1 = c) and HL spinons (\u03b1 = s) such that L\u03b1 = 2S\u03b1 where S\u03b1 is the \u03b7-spin\n(\u03b1 = c) and spin (\u03b1 = s) respectively [11]. On the other hand, the number of c pseudoparticle holes is Nch = [Na \u2212Nc ],\nas given below in Eq. (28). The pseudoparticles obey a Pauli principle respecting the band-momentum occupancies,\ni.e. a discrete band-momentum value qj can either be unoccupied or singly occupied by a pseudoparticle.\nIt follows from Eq. (16) that the discrete band-momentum values qj are such that,\nqj+1 \u2212 qj =\n\n2\u03c0\n.\nL\n\n(19)\n\nThe band-momentum distribution functions Nc (q) and {N\u03b1, \u03bd (q)} where \u03b1 = c, s and \u03bd = 1, 2, ... read Nc (qj ) = 1 and\nN\u03b1, \u03bd (qj ) = 1 for occupied values of the discrete band momentum qj and Nc (qj ) = 0 and N\u03b1, \u03bd (qj ) = 0 for unoccupied\nvalues of that band momentum.

Let us now consider the particular case of a ground state.\nIn the case of electronic densities n and spin densities m such that 0 \u2264 n \u2264 1/a and 0 \u2264 m \u2264 n respectively, a ground\nstate belongs to a CPHS ensemble subspace with the values for the pseudoparticle, \u00b11/2 holon, and \u00b11/2 spinon\nnumbers given by Lc, \u22121/2 = Mc, \u22121/2 = 0, Mc, +1/2 = Lc, +1/2 = (Na \u2212 N 0 ), Nc = N 0 , and Nc, \u03bd = 0 in the charge\nsector. In the spin sector the numbers are Ms, \u22121/2 = N\u21930 , Ms, +1/2 = N\u21910 , Ls, +1/2 = (N\u21910 \u2212 N\u21930 ), Ns, 1 = N\u21930 , and\nLs, \u22121/2 = Ns, \u03bd = 0. In these expressions the electron numbers N\u21930 , N\u21930 , and N 0 = N\u21930 + N\u21930 refer to the ground state.\n\u2217\nIn the case of the ground-state CPHS ensemble subspace the expression of the number N\u03b1,\n\u03bd given in Eqs.

I and II, the energy eigenstates of the 1D Hubbard model are described by the the same\nrotated-electron site distribution configurations for all values of U/t. Fortunately, since the electron - rotated electron\nunitary transformation becomes the unit transformation as U/t \u2192 \u221e, one can reach the U/t independent rotatedelectron site distribution configurations which describe the energy eigenstates by studying the corresponding electron\nsite distribution configurations for the 1D Hubbard model in the limit U/t \u2192 \u221e. Thus the main goal of this section\nis to extract from the physics associated with the U/t \u2192 \u221e limit of the model useful information for the construction\nof the rotated-electron occupancy configurations that describe the energy eigenstates for finite values of U/t.\nIn the limit U/t \u2192 \u221e there is a huge degeneracy of \u03b7-spin and spin occupancy configurations. Such a degeneracy\nresults from the simple form that the kinetic energy T and potential energy V spectra associated with the operators\n(4) and (5) respectively, have in the limit U/t \u2192 \u221e,\n\nEH = T + V ;\n\nT = 2t\n\nNa\nX\n\nNc (qj )[\u22122t cos qj ] ;\n\nV /U = D ,\n\n(31)\n\nj=1\n\nwhere EH is the energy spectrum of the Hamiltonian (3) and the electron double occupation D is a good quantum\nnumber which equals rotated-electron double occupation in that limit. The kinetic energy equals that of a system of\nfree spin-less fermions [2, 3, 4, 5]. The corresponding momentum spectrum is given in Eq. (A3) of Appendix A. A short\ndiscussion of the relation of our results to some of the well known concepts of the U/t \u2192 \u221e physics is presented in that\nAppendix. Since the energy spectrum (31) is independent of the \u03b7-spin and spin occupancy configurations, there are\nseveral choices for complete sets of energy eigenstates with the same energy and momentum spectra. However, only\none of these choices is associated with the rotated-electron site distribution configurations which describe the energy\neigenstates for all values of U/t. The discussion presented in Appendix A and in this section about the relation of the\nenergy-eigenstate rotated-electron description introduced in this paper to other choices of energy eigenstates and to\nthe t/U << 1 physics associated with the leading-order t/U corrections to the energy spectrum (31) contextualizes\nthe quantum problem studied in this paper and contributes to its deeper understanding.\nThe pseudoparticle band momentum obeys well defined boundary conditions which are a necessary condition for\nthe fulfilment of the periodic boundary conditions for the original electrons. However, such a pseudoparticle bandmomentum boundary conditions are not a sufficient condition to ensure the electronic periodic boundary conditions.\nA second condition imposes that the internal structure of the local \u03b1, \u03bd pseudoparticles introduced in later sections\nmust be of a specific form. In this section we introduce a set of properties which are rather useful both for the\nconstruction of the specific rotated-electron site distribution configurations which describe the internal structure of\nsuch local \u03b1, \u03bd pseudoparticles and the definition of the corresponding pseudoparticle empty sites in terms of occupancy\nconfigurations of rotated-electron sites. As further discussed in Sec. VI, the construction of the rotated-electron site\ndistribution configurations which describe the energy eigenstates and the introduction of the associated concepts of\nlocal pseudoparticle and effective pseudoparticle lattice are necessary steps for the evaluation of few-electron spectral\nfunctions at finite values of excitation energy.\nOur choice of energy eigenstates corresponds to the band-momentum energy eigenstates associated with the thermodynamic Bethe-ansatz equations introduced by Takahashi [7]. As discussed in Appendix A, for U/t \u2192 \u221e there are\nother choices for complete sets of energy eigenstates. One of the alternative complete set of energy and momentum\neigenstates for the model in the limit U/t \u2192 \u221e can be explicitly constructed for the Harris-Lange model mentioned\nin Appendix A by the method used in Ref. [51]. Both the band-momentum energy eigenstates and the symmetrized\nenergy eigenstates used in that reference are superpositions of charge (and spin) sequences formed by local electron\ndistribution configurations of doubly occupied and empty sites (and spin-down and spin-up singly occupied sites).\nThe expression of both these two sets of energy eigenstates ensures the periodic boundary conditions for the original\nelectronic problem.\nThrough out this paper we denote the rotated-electron doubly occupied and empty sites by \u2022 and \u25e6 (and the\nspin-down and spin-up rotated-electron singly occupied sites by \u2193 and \u2191) respectively. In the present U/t \u2192 \u221e limit\nsuch a concept also refers to electrons. Often we add an index to these symbols which defines the position of the\ndoubly occupied site or empty site (and spin-down singly occupied site or spin-up singly occupied site). In the case\nof the symmetrized energy eigenstates the charge and spin sequences are properly symmetrized owing to the periodic\nboundary conditions of the original problem. (This justifies the designation of symmetrized energy eigenstates.) The\nprocedure used in such a symmetrization involves powers of suitable charge and spin operators T\u0302C and T\u0302S respectively,\nfor cyclic permutation of the electron site distribution configurations of the local charge and spin sequences [51]. For\n\n\f9\ninstance, let\n(\u2022, \u2022, \u25e6, \u2022, \u25e6, ..., \u25e6, \u2022, \u2022) ,\n\n(32)\n\n(\u2193, \u2191, \u2193, \u2191, \u2191, ..., \u2193, \u2193, \u2191) ,\n\n(33)\n\nand\n\nbe a charge and a spin sequence respectively. Then the operators T\u0302C and T\u0302S are such that,\nT\u0302C (\u2022, \u2022, \u25e6, \u2022, \u25e6, ..., \u25e6, \u2022, \u25e6) = (\u25e6, \u2022, \u2022, \u25e6, \u2022, \u25e6, ..., \u25e6, \u2022) ,\n\n(34)\n\nT\u0302S (\u2193, \u2191, \u2193, \u2191, \u2191, ..., \u2193, \u2193, \u2191) = (\u2191, \u2193, \u2191, \u2193, \u2191, \u2191, ..., \u2193, \u2193) ,\n\n(35)\n\nand\n\nrespectively. The powers [T\u0302C ]KC and [T\u0302S ]KS were called in Ref. [51] KC and KS respectively. This introduces the\ncharge momentum kC and spin momentum kS respectively, such that,\n2\u03c0\nmC ;\nKC a\n2\u03c0\n=\nmS ;\nKS a\n\nkC =\n\nmC = 0, 1, ..., KC \u2212 1 ,\n\nkS\n\nmS = 0, 1, ..., KS \u2212 1 .\n\n(36)\n\nThe symmetrized energy eigenstates are classified according to their charge and spin sequence, their charge momentum kC and spin momentum kS , and a number NC of momenta which in the notation of Ref. [51] equals the\nnumber of charges. The latter discrete momenta are closely related to the discrete band-momentum values occupied\nby c pseudoparticle holes in the pseudoparticle representation of the band-momentum energy eigenstates studied in\nlater sections. Moreover, the number NC of charges equals both the number Nch of c pseudoparticle holes and the\nnumber Mc of holons. Thus this is a good quantum number for both the band-momentum and symmetrized energy\neigenstates. However, the charge momentum kC and spin momentum kS are eigenvalues of the charge momentum\noperator k\u0302C and spin momentum operator k\u0302S respectively, which in general do not commute with the set of operators\n{N\u0302\u03b1, \u03bd (qj )} of the band-momentum basis. Thus in general the band-momentum energy eigenstates are not eigenstates\nof the charge momentum operator k\u0302C and spin momentum operator k\u0302S . Exceptions are the band-momentum energy\neigenstates with occupancy of a single c, \u03bd pseudoparticle (and a single s, \u03bd pseudoparticle) and with no finite occupancy of Yang holons (and HL spinons) and of c, \u03bd \u2032 pseudoparticles (and s, \u03bd \u2032 pseudoparticles) belonging to other\nbranches such that \u03bd \u2032 6= \u03bd. We find below that in this case the corresponding band-momentum energy eigenstate is\nalso an eigenstate of the charge (and spin) momentum operator of eigenvalue kC = \u03c0/a (and kS = \u03c0/a).\nAccording to Eq. (19) the discrete values of the band momentum qj are such that qj+1 \u2212 qj = 2\u03c0/L and qj =\n\u2217\n[2\u03c0/L] Ijc or qj = [2\u03c0/L] Ij\u03b1, \u03bd where the numbers Ijc and Ij\u03b1, \u03bd with j = 1, 2, ..., Na and j = 1, 2, ..., N\u03b1,\n\u03bd respectively,\nare integers or half-odd integers as a result of the following boundary conditions,\n[\neiqj L = (ei\u03c0 )\n\nP\n\n\u03b1=c, s\n\nP\u221e\n\n\u03bd=1\n\nN\u03b1, \u03bd ]\n\n,\n\n(37)\n\nin the case of the c pseudoparticle branch and,\n\u2217\n\neiqj L = (ei\u03c0 )[1+N\u03b1, \u03bd ] = (ei\u03c0 )[1+L\u03b1 +N\u03b1, \u03bd ] = (ei\u03c0 )[1+Nc +N\u03b1, \u03bd ] ;\n\n\u03b1 = c, s ,\n\n\u03bd = 1, 2, ... ,\n\n(38)\n\nin the case of the \u03b1, \u03bd pseudoparticle branches. Here N\u03b1, \u03bd and L\u03b1 denote the number of \u03b1, \u03bd pseudoparticles and of\n\u2217\nYang holons (\u03b1 = c) or HL spinons (\u03b1 = s) respectively, and the number N\u03b1,\n\u03bd is given in Eq. (17). According to\n\u2217\nEq. (20), in the case of the \u03b1, \u03bd pseudoparticle branches the j = 1 minimum and j = N\u03b1,\n\u03bd maximum index of the\nband-momentum values qj are such that,\n\u2217\n\u2212q1 = qN\u03b1,\n= q\u03b1, \u03bd =\n\u03bd\n\n\u03c0 \u2217\n[N\n\u2212 1] .\nL \u03b1, \u03bd\n\n(39)\n\n\f10\nIn the case of the c pseudoparticles the limiting values are q1 = qc\u2212 and qNa = qc+ where the band momenta qc\u00b1 are\ndefined in Eqs. (21)-(23).\nThere is a holon, spinon, c pseudoparticle separation for the whole parameter space of the 1D Hubbard model\n[11]. In the case of the t/U \u2192 0 limit the description of the c pseudoparticle excitation sector is very similar for\nboth the representations in terms of band-momentum energy eigenstates and of symmetrized energy eigenstates. The\nseparation of the charge and spin excitation sectors occurs for these two alternative representations. The construction\nof the band-momentum energy eigenstates also involves superpositions of charge (and spin) sequences associated with\nrotated-electron distribution configurations of doubly occupied and empty sites (and spin-down and spin-up singly\noccupied sites). Such superpositions are also due to the periodic boundary conditions but are not in general generated\nby the above symmetrization procedure. In spite of these general similarities, the symmetrized and band-momentum\nenergy eigenstates of the 1D Hubbard model in the limit of t/U \u2192 0 are different states. The difference between\nthe symmetrized and band-momentum energy eigenstates refers in general both to the form of the local electron\ndistribution configurations of doubly occupied and empty sites (and spin-down and spin-up singly occupied sites)\nwhich describe the charge (and spin) sequences and to the form of the superposition of these local sequences which\ndescribes the energy eigenstates.\nLet us introduce eight properties which correspond to a first step of the introduction of the concepts of local pseudoparticle and effective pseudoparticle lattices. However, the precise definition of these concepts involves clarification\nof several issues and is only fulfilled in Sec. V. These properties are used in the ensuing section in finding the electron\nsite distribution configurations of the local charge and spin sequences whose Fourier-transform superpositions describe\nthe band-momentum energy eigenstates of the model in the limit t/U \u2192 0. These properties follow in part from symmetries and features of the pseudoparticle, holon, and spin description and related rotated electron representation\nstudied in Refs. [11, 12, 13] and from well known properties associated with the t/U \u2192 0 physics. We emphasize that\nthe properties given below also apply to finite values of t/U provided that electrons are replaced by rotated electrons.\nThese useful properties read:\n1-III The numbers of electron doubly occupied sites, empty sites, spin-down singly occupied sites, and spin-up\nsingly occupied sites are good quantum numbers whose values are equal to the total numbers of \u22121/2 holons, +1/2\nholons, \u22121/2 spinons, and +1/2 spinons respectively, of the band-momentum energy eigenstates.\n2-III The kinetic energy T given in Eq. (31) arises from the movements of the singly occupied sites relative to the\ndoubly occupied and empty sides which do not change double occupation. These movements are fully described by the\nc pseudoparticles which are associated with the charge degrees of freedom of these sites. In the limit t/U \u2192 0 these\nquantum objects acquire a spin-less fermion spectrum. On the other hand, the electron distribution configurations of\ndoubly occupied and empty sites and of spin-down and spin-up singly occupied sites do not contribute to the kinetic\nenergy T . Moreover these electron site distribution configurations must remain unchanged in spite of the movements\nof the c pseudoparticles. Alternatively, we can consider that the electron doubly occupied and empty sites move\nrelative to the singly occupied sites. In this case one describes the movements of the c pseudoparticles in terms of the\nmovements of the corresponding c pseudoparticle holes. This is the choice of Ref. [51] for the case of the symmetrized\nenergy eigenstates. We recall that the numbers Nc of c pseudoparticles, Nch of c pseudoparticle holes, Ms of spinons,\nand Mc of holons are such that Nc + Nch = Na , Nc = Ms , and Nch = Mc and thus these two alternative descriptions\nare fully equivalent.\n3-III We call local charge sequences and local spin sequences the occupancy configurations of the \u00b11/2 holons\n(and corresponding electron distribution configurations of doubly occupied and empty sites) and the occupancy\nconfigurations of the \u00b11/2 spinons (and corresponding electron distribution configurations of singly occupied sites\nof spin projection \u00b11/2) respectively. These local charge (and spin) sequences can also be expressed in terms of\noccupancy configurations of \u00b11/2 Yang holons and local c, \u03bd pseudoparticles (and \u00b11/2 HL spinons and local s, \u03bd\npseudoparticles) belonging to \u03bd = 1, 2, 3... branches. From the general properties introduced in Ref. [11] one finds\nthat the electron description of these quantum objects in terms of distribution configurations of electron doubly\noccupied and empty sites (and spin-down and spin-up singly occupied sites) is as follows: A \u22121/2 Yang holon (and\n\u22121/2 HL spinon) is described by a doubly occupied site (and a spin-down singly occupied site); A +1/2 Yang holon\n(and +1/2 HL spinon) is described by an empty site (and a spin-up singly occupied site); A local c, \u03bd pseudoparticle\n(and a local s, \u03bd pseudoparticle) is described by a number \u03bd of doubly occupied sites and a number \u03bd of empty sites\n(and a number \u03bd of spin-down singly occupied sites and a number \u03bd of spin-up singly occupied sites). The electron\ndistribution configurations of doubly occupied and empty sites (and of spin-down and spin-up singly occupied sites)\nof any local charge (and spin) sequence can be expressed in terms of a corresponding occupancy configuration of\n\u00b11/2 Yang holons and local c, \u03bd pseudoparticles (and \u00b11/2 HL spinons and local s, \u03bd pseudoparticles) belonging\n\n\f11\nto the \u03bd = 1, 2, 3... branches. The form of Eqs. (A2) and (A3) of Appendix A reveals that a \u22121/2 holon carries\nmomentum \u03c0/a and that in the limit t/U \u2192 0 each doubly occupied site must also be associated with a momentum\n\u03c0/a respectively. Therefore, the expressions of the local charge sequences must include a phase factor operator\nP\nexp(i\u03c0 j j D\u0302j ) such that the j summation runs over the sites doubly occupied and empty and the local double\noccupation operator has eigenvalues 1 and 0 if the site j is doubly occupied and empty respectively.\n4-III The number of different possible discrete locations of the electron distribution configurations of doubly occupied\nand empty sites (\u03b1 = c) or of spin-down and spin-up singly occupied sites (\u03b1 = s) describing a local \u03b1, \u03bd pseudoparticle\n\u2217\nequals the number N\u03b1,\n\u03bd given in Eq. (17). Each of these possible positions corresponds to a different local charge\n\u2217\n(\u03b1 = c) or spin (\u03b1 = s) sequence. The number N\u03b1,\n\u03bd is directly provided by the Bethe-ansatz solution [11] since it also\n\u2217\nequals the number of different discrete band momentum values qj , where j = 1, 2, ..., N\u03b1,\n\u03bd , of the band-momentum\n\u03b1, \u03bd pseudoparticle band.\n5-III In case of energy eigenstates with finite occupancy of \u22121/2 and +1/2 Yang holons (and \u22121/2 and +1/2 HL\nspinons) the electron distribution configurations of doubly occupied and empty sites (and spin-down and spin-up\nsingly occupied sites) describing the local c, \u03bd pseudoparticle (and local s, \u03bd pseudoparticle) must remain unchanged\nunder the application of the off-diagonal generators of the SU (2) \u03b7-spin algebra given in Eq. (7) (and off-diagonal\ngenerators of the SU (2) spin algebra given in Eq. (8)). Moreover, in case of states with no +1/2 or \u22121/2 Yang holons\nP\nP\nc\nc\n= j (\u22121)j cj, \u2191 cj, \u2193\n(and no +1/2 or \u22121/2 HL spinons) application of the operators \u015c+\n= j (\u22121)j c\u2020j, \u2193 c\u2020j, \u2191 or \u015c\u2212\nP\nP\ns\ns\n= j c\u2020j, \u2191 cj, \u2193 ) onto these states must give zero. These requirements result from the\n= j c\u2020j, \u2193 cj, \u2191 or \u015c\u2212\n(and \u015c+\nvalue of the \u03b7 spin of the c, \u03bd pseudoparticles (and spin of the s, \u03bd pseudoparticles) which is given by sc = 0 (and\nss = 0) [11]. On the other hand, the transformations generated by application of these off-diagonal generators onto the\nelectron distribution configurations of doubly occupied and empty sites (and spin-down and spin-up singly occupied\nsites) describing the \u00b11/2 Yang holons (and \u00b11/2 HL spinons) must be the ones defined by the \u03b7-spin (and spin)\nalgebra [11].\n6-III Let us consider a local charge (and spin) sequence with no Yang holons (and no HL spinons) and consisting\nof \u03bd electron doubly occupied sites and \u03bd electron empty sites (and \u03bd electron spin-down singly occupied sites and \u03bd\nelectron spin-up singly occupied sites). If such a sequence describes a single local c, \u03bd pseudoparticle (and local s, \u03bd\npseudoparticle) it is properly symmetrized in such way that the distribution configurations associated with the internal\nstructure of that quantum object remain unchanged under cyclic permutations. Furthermore, property 5-III imposes\nthat a band-momentum energy eigenstate with the above Yang holon and c, \u03bd pseudoparticle (and HL spinon and\ns, \u03bd pseudoparticle) numbers is an eigenstate of the charge (and spin) momentum operator k\u0302C (and k\u0302S ) of eigenvalue\nkC = \u03c0/a (and kS = \u03c0/a).\n7-III The electron distribution configurations of the \u03bd doubly occupied sites and \u03bd empty sites (and \u03bd spin-down\nsingly occupied sites and \u03bd spin-up singly occupied sites) which describe the internal structure a local c, \u03bd pseudoparticle (and s, \u03bd pseudoparticle) should be the same for all local charge (\u03b1 = c) or spin (\u03b1 = s) sequences involved in the\ndescription of the 4Na band-momentum energy eigenstates. This is a necessary condition for the indiscernible character of local \u03b1, \u03bd pseudoparticles with the same lattice position but involved in occupancy configurations describing\ndifferent local charge (\u03b1 = c) or spin (\u03b1 = s) sequences. This indiscernible character of the local \u03b1, \u03bd pseudoparticles\nfollows from the corresponding indiscernible character of the \u03b1, \u03bd pseudoparticles of band-momentum qj , which are\nindistinguishable quantum objects.\n8-III Since in the limit t/U \u2192 0 there is nearest-neighbor hopping only and it does not change double occupation,\nthe charge, spin, c pseudoparticle separation studied in Ref. [11] implies that both the local charge and spin sequences\nof the energy eigenstates must be separately conserved. Moreover, the periodic boundary conditions of the original\nelectronic problem are ensured if both the pseudoparticle band-momentum discrete values obey Eqs. (37) and (38)\nand the requirements of the basic properties 6-III and 7-III are fulfilled. The band-momentum energy eigenstates are\nFourier transform superpositions of local charge sequences, spin sequences, and c pseudoparticle sequences corresponding to Slater determinants involving the pseudoparticle band momentum qj and the spatial coordinate xj of these\nquantum objects. Both in the case of the c pseudoparticle branch and of the \u03b1, \u03bd pseudoparticle branches with finite\noccupancy in a given state, such spatial coordinate is the conjugate of the band momentum qj of the above Fourier\ntransforms. The spatial coordinate xj of the c pseudoparticles (and \u03b1, \u03bd pseudoparticles) is associated with an effective\n\u2217\npseudoparticle lattice of length L, number of lattice sites Na (and N\u03b1,\n\u03bd given in Eq. (17)) and lattice constant a (and\n\u2217\na\u03b1, \u03bd = L/N\u03b1,\n).\nThe\npossible\nvalues\nof\nthese\nspatial\ncoordinates\nare\nxj = a j where j = 1, 2, 3, ..., Na (and xj = a\u03b1, \u03bd j\n\u03bd\n\n\f12\n\u2217\nwhere j = 1, 2, 3, ..., N\u03b1,\n\u03bd ). The effective pseudoparticle lattices arise because the occupancy configurations of the\ndifferent pseudoparticle branches are separately conserved.\n\nThese eight basic properties play an important role in the mechanisms which in the t/U \u2192 0 limit determine the\nchoice of the electron site distribution configurations of the local charge, spin, and c pseudoparticle sequences whose\nFourier transform superpositions describe the band-momentum energy eigenstates. Property 1-III follows from well\nknown properties of the 1D Hubbard model in the limit t/U \u2192 0. Property 2-III is consistent with the finding of Ref.\n[12] that in the limit t/U \u2192 0 only the c pseudoparticles move and carry kinetic energy, whereas the \u00b11/2 holons\nand \u00b11/2 spinons correspond to unchanged occupancy configurations in that limit. Such a property results from\nwell established features of the Bethe-ansatz solution [2, 5, 12]. Property 3-III is a consequence of the combination\nof property 1-III with the relation of Yang holons, HL spinons, and \u03b1, \u03bd pseudoparticles to \u00b11/2 holons and \u00b11/2\n\u2217\nspinons. In property 4-III the number N\u03b1,\n\u03bd given in Eq. (17) plays a central role. The expression of that number\nis valid for all values of U/t and is provided by the Bethe ansatz solution. This is consistent with the electron site\ndistribution configurations which describe the local \u03b1, \u03bd pseudoparticles in the limit of t/U \u2192 0 being the same as\nthe rotated-electron configurations which describe these local \u03b1, \u03bd pseudoparticles for finite values of t/U . Property\n5-III follows from general symmetries of the 1D Hubbard model which are also valid for all values of U/t. This basic\nproperty is also consistent with the above equivalence of the electron site distribution configurations in the limit of\nt/U \u2192 0 and of the rotated-electron configurations for finite values of t/U . Property 6-III is a consequence of the\nperiodic boundary conditions in the particular case when a local charge or spin sequence corresponds to a single c, \u03bd\nor s, \u03bd pseudoparticle respectively. Property 7-III results from the indiscernible character of the \u03b1, \u03bd pseudoparticles.\nIn the case of band-momentum pseudoparticles such an indiscernible character is implicit in the description of the\nband-momentum energy eigenstates in terms of pseudoparticle occupancy configurations [11, 12]. Finally, property\n8-III is related to the periodic boundary conditions of the original electronic problem and to the existence in this\nlimit of nearest-neighbor hopping only which does not change double occupation. Such a property is also related to\nthe charge, spin, c pseudoparticle separation studied in Ref. [11] for all energy scales and for the whole parameter\nspace of the 1D Hubbard model. In addition, in the case of the \u03b1, \u03bd pseudoparticle branches, we find below that\nthe occurrence of the effective pseudoparticle lattices mentioned in this property is related to the separation of the\ninternal and translational degrees of freedom of the local \u03b1, \u03bd pseudoparticles.\nSince in the t/U \u2192 0 limit the rotated electrons become the electrons, often below we refer to the rotated-electron\nsite distribution configurations only. However, whenever referring to rotated electrons we mean implicitly that in the\nlimit t/U \u2192 0 the electron site distribution configurations which describe the band-momentum energy eigenstates are\nthe same.\nIV.\n\nTHE PSEUDOPARTICLE INTERNAL STRUCTURE AND COMPLETE SET OF LOCAL STATES\nIN TERMS OF CHARGE, SPIN, AND c PSEUDOPARTICLE SEQUENCES\n\nIn this section we find the rotated-electron site distribution configurations which describe the local charge, spin,\nand c pseudoparticle sequences. This requires the study of the internal structure of the local \u03b1, \u03bd pseudoparticles.\nIn addition, such an analysis requires the definition of the positions in the effective electronic lattice of the rotatedelectron site distribution configurations which describe both the local c and \u03b1, \u03bd pseudoparticles and their empty sites.\nWe find that each specific site distribution configurations of a local charge, spin, and c pseudoparticle sequence defines\na local state. The set of all different possible such states constitutes a complete set of local states. In the ensuing\nsection we express the energy eigenstates of the model as a Fourier-transform superposition of these local states. Such\na study reveals the connection of the energy eigenstates to the rotated electron distribution configurations of doubly\noccupied sites, empty sites, spin-down singly occupied sites, and spin-up singly occupied sites which describe the local\nstates.\nA.\n\nTHE LOCAL \u03b1, \u03bd PSEUDOPARTICLE INTERNAL STRUCTURE\n\nIn the following we use in part the basic properties 1-III to 8-III to study the rotated-electron site distribution\nconfigurations which describe the local pseudoparticles introduced in this paper. We start by restricting our study\nto rotated-electron site distribution configurations which describe the lowest-weight states of both the SU (2) \u03b7-spin\nand spin algebras. These states have no \u22121/2 Yang holons and no \u22121/2 HL spinons. Thus in this case the number\nof Yang holons (and of HL spinons) is such that Lc = Lc,+1/2 (and Ls = Ls,+1/2 ).\nIn the limit U/t \u2192 \u221e the Nc c pseudoparticles behave as spin-less fermions in a lattice of Na = Nc + Nch = Ms + Mc\nsites. Such a lattice is nothing but the effective c pseudoparticle lattice mentioned in property 8-III. As in the case of\n\n\f13\nthe band-momentum qj , such an effective c pseudoparticle lattice and its site coordinates xj remain the same for the\nwhole parameter space of the model. Also the c pseudoparticle occupancy configurations of such a lattice describing\na given energy eigenstate are the same for all values of U/t, density n, and spin density m. At a fixed value Nc = Ms\nof the numbers Nc of c pseudoparticles and Ms of spinons the number of occupancy configurations of the local c\npseudoparticles in such an effective lattice is given by,\n\u0012 \u0013\nNa !\nNa !\nNa\n=\n.\n=\nNc ! Nch !\nMs ! Mc !\nNc\n\n(40)\n\nEach of these c pseudoparticle occupancy configurations of the effective c pseudoparticle lattice defines a local c\npseudoparticle sequence.\nLet xjl = a jl where l = 1, 2, ..., Nc be the actual set of occupied coordinates of the effective c pseudoparticle lattice\nout of the available xj = a j coordinate sites where j = 1, 2, ..., Na . We note that these Na sites have the same\ncoordinates and lattice constant a as the Na sites of the effective electronic lattice. Moreover, the set of coordinates\nxjl = a jl where l = 1, 2, ..., Nc corresponding to the occupied sites of the effective c pseudoparticle lattice are precisely\nthe same as the coordinates of the rotated electron singly occupied sites. Thus we can define each of the occupancy\nconfigurations whose total number is given in Eq. (40) by the coordinates in units of the lattice constant a of the\nrotated-electron singly occupied sites,\n(j1 , j2 , ..., jNc ) .\n\n(41)\n\nThe positions occupied by the rotated-electron doubly occupied and empty sites are then these left over by the rotatedelectron singly occupied sites. Since the sequence (41) also gives the positions of the local c pseudoparticles in their\neffective lattice, the sites left over by these pseudoparticles define the positions of the local c pseudoparticle holes.\nThus the relation of the numbers Nc and Nch of local c pseudoparticles and local c pseudoparticle holes respectively,\nto the rotated-electron site distribution configurations of a given energy eigenstate confirms that there are Nc rotatedelectron singly occupied sites and Nch = [Na \u2212 Nc ] rotated-electron doubly-occupied and empty sites, as mentioned\nin Sec. II. From the use of Eqs. (27) and (28) we find that these numbers can be expressed as follows,\n\nNch = Na \u2212 Nc = Lc + 2\nNc = L s + 2\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n\u03bd=1\n\u221e\nX\n\n\u03bd Nc, \u03bd ;\n\u03bd Ns, \u03bd .\n\n(42)\n\n\u03bd=1\n\nThe local charge sequences (and spin sequences) introduced in property 3-III involve only the rotated-electron\ndoubly-occupied and empty site distribution configurations (and spin-down and spin-up rotated-electron singly occupied site distribution configurations) of Nch = [Na \u2212 Nc ] sites (and Nc sites) out of a total number Na of sites.\nAs a result of the independent conservation of the charge and spin sequences, the rotated-electron site distribution\nconfigurations of a charge (and spin) sequence is for any energy eigenstate obtained simply by omitting the Nc singly\noccupied sites (and Nch = [Na \u2212 Nc ] doubly-occupied and empty sites). Thus a local charge (and spin) sequence corresponds to the rotated-electron occupancy configurations of a site domain of a number Nch = [Na \u2212 Nc ] of sites (and\nNc of sites). It follows that the number of sites of such a domain depends on the specific state under consideration. In\nthe case of the ground state numbers provided in Sec. II, the number of sites of the effective electronic lattice which\nbelong to the charge and spin sequences is [Na \u2212 N 0 ] and N 0 respectively.\nAlso the effective \u03b1, \u03bd pseudoparticle lattices mentioned in property 8-III and introduced below, result from independent conservation laws associated with each \u03b1, \u03bd pseudoparticle branch such that \u03b1 = c, s and \u03bd = 1, 2, ... branch.\nThese heffective c, \u03bd pseudoparticle\n(and s, \u03bd pseudoparticle)\nlatticesi are generated below by omission of a number\ni\nP\u221e h\nP\u221e\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u03bd \u2032 =1 \u03bd + \u03bd \u2212 |\u03bd \u2212 \u03bd | Ns, \u03bd \u2032 \u2212 Ns, \u03bd ) of sites out of the total number\n\u03bd \u2032 =1 \u03bd + \u03bd \u2212 |\u03bd \u2212 \u03bd | Nc, \u03bd \u2032 \u2212 Nc, \u03bd (and\n\nNch = [Na \u2212 Nc ] (and Nc ) of sites of the local charge sequence (and spin sequence). Again the number of sites of the\nlocal charge (and spin) sequence which contribute to an effective c, \u03bd pseudoparticle (and s, \u03bd pseudoparticle) lattice\ndepends on the specific state under consideration. For instance, in the case of a ground state the number of sites of the\nlocal charge sequence (and spin sequence) which contribute to an effective c, \u03bd pseudoparticle (and s, \u03bd pseudoparticle)\nlattice is [Na \u2212 N 0 ] (and N\u21910 for the s, 1 pseudoparticle branch and [N\u21910 \u2212 N\u21930 ] for the s, \u03bd pseudoparticle branches\nsuch that \u03bd > 1) out of the [Na \u2212 N 0 ] sites (and N 0 = [N\u21910 + N\u21930 ] sites) of such a sequence. On the other hand, the\n\n\f14\nnumber of sites of the effective c pseudoparticle lattice equals the number Na of sites of the effective electronic lattice\nand is the same for all energy eigenstates.\nThe expressions of Eq. (42) show that the value of the number Lc of Yang holons (and Ls of HL spinons)\nof the local charge (and spin) sequence is uniquely determined by the values of the numbers of c pseudoparticles\nand c, \u03bd pseudoparticles (c pseudoparticles and s, \u03bd pseudoparticles) of the same sequence. Thus for given number\nNch = [Na + Nc ] of rotated-electron doubly-occupied and empty sites (and Nc of rotated-electron singly occupied sites)\nwe can uniquely define the rotated-electron site distribution configurations of the local charge (and spin) sequence\nby providing the sites occupied by local c, \u03bd pseudoparticles (and s, \u03bd pseudoparticles) belonging to the branches\n\u03bd = 1, 2, ... with finite occupancy. The charge-sequence (and spin-sequence) sites of the effective electronic lattice left\nover by these local pseudoparticles define the positions of the Yang holons (and HL spinons). It is useful to introduce\nthe charge-sequence site index h and the spin-sequence site index l such that,\nh = 1, 2, ..., [Na \u2212 Nc ] ;\n\nl = 1, 2, ..., Nc .\n\n(43)\n\nThe ordering of the charge-sequence (and spin-sequence) index corresponds to the location order from the left to the\nright-hand side of the corresponding site in the effective electronic lattice. The position in the effective electronic\nlattice of a spin-sequence site of index l and of a charge-sequence site of index h are given by,\nxjl = jl a ,\n\nl = 1, 2, ..., Nc ;\n\nxjh = jh a ,\n\nh = 1, 2, ..., [Na \u2212 Nc ] ,\n\n(44)\n\nwhere jl are the indices of Eq. (41) which define the location of the rotated-electron singly occupied sites and jh are\nthe indices which define the location of the rotated-electron doubly occupied and empty sites. The location of the\nlatter sites corresponds to the sites left over by the rotated-electron singly occupied sites.\nFrom both the above analysis and property 3-III we conclude that one can uniquely specify a given rotatedelectron\nof the Nc sites occupied by local c pseudoparticles,\nP\u221e site distribution configuration by providing the position P\n\u221e\n2 \u03bd=1 \u03bd Nc, \u03bd sites occupied by local c, \u03bd pseudoparticles, and 2 \u03bd=1 \u03bd Ns, \u03bd sites occupied by local s, \u03bd pseudoparticles. The Nc sites occupied by c pseudoparticles define the location of the rotated-electron singly occupied sites.\nThe [Na \u2212 Nc ] rotated-electron doubly-occupied and empty sites are the sites left over by the rotated-electron singly\noccupied sites. The Lc = 2Sc sites occupied by Yang holons and the Ls = 2Ss sites occupied by HL spinons are the\nsites left over in the charge and spin sequences respectively, by the sites occupied by local c, \u03bd pseudoparticles and\nlocal s, \u03bd pseudoparticles respectively. As mentioned above, to start with we consider that all Yang holons (and HL\nspinons) have \u03b7-spin projection (and spin projection) +1/2 and thus correspond to rotated-electron empty sites (and\nrotated-electron spin-up singly occupied sites). The generalization to rotated-electron site distribution occupancies\nassociated with states containing both \u00b11/2 Yang holons (and \u00b11/2 HL spinons) is straightforward and is introduced\nlater in this section.\nThe Yang holons (and HL spinons) have no internal structure and are the simplest of the quantum objects which\noccupy the charge (and spin) sequence of the effective electronic lattice. According to property 1-III, the +1/2\nYang holons (and +1/2 HL spinons) correspond to rotated-electron empty sites (and spin-up rotated-electron singly\noccupied sites) of these sequences. On the other hand, a local \u03b1, \u03bd pseudoparticle has internal structure and thus\nis a more involved quantum object than a Yang holon or a HL spinon. This internal structure corresponds to the\nrotated-electron distribution configurations of the \u03bd doubly occupied sites and \u03bd empty sites (\u03b1 = c) or \u03bd spin-down\nsingly occupied sites and \u03bd spin-up singly occupied sites (\u03b1 = s) which according to property 3-III describe such\na local \u03b1, \u03bd pseudoparticle. If in the rotated-electron site distribution configurations which describe the local c, \u03bd\npseudoparticles we replace doubly occupied sites \u2022 and empty sites \u25e6 by spin-down singly occupiedPsites \u2193 and spin-up\nsingly occupied sites \u2191 respectively, and omit the phase factors generate by the operator exp(i\u03c0 j j D\u0302j ) mentioned\nin property 3-III, we obtain the corresponding distribution configurations of the s, \u03bd pseudoparticles. Therefore, often\nwe consider the rotated-electron site distribution configurations which describe the local c, \u03bd pseudoparticles only.\nIt is useful to classify the 2\u03bd lattice sites of the local charge sequence involved in the description of a local c, \u03bd\npseudoparticle into two sets of \u03bd sites each. Let us denote the index of these two sets of \u03bd sites by hj, g and\nhj, \u03bd+g respectively. Here g = 1, 2, ..., \u03bd and the index j = 1, 2, ..., Nc,\u2217 \u03bd refers to the position [hj a] of the local\nc, \u03bd pseudoparticle in the effective electronic lattice where,\n\nhj =\n\njhj, \u03bd + jhj, \u03bd+1\n,\n2\n\n(45)\n\nand the numbers jhj, \u03bd are the indices jh of Eq. (41) which define the location of the rotated-electron doubly occupied/empty sites in such a lattice. Combination of the values of the indices j = 1, 2, ..., Nc,\u2217 \u03bd and g = 1, 2, ..., \u03bd\n\n\f15\nfully defines the position of the above 2\u03bd sites. The index g is such that hj, 1 < hj, 2 < ... < hj, \u03bd and\nhj, \u03bd+1 < hj, \u03bd+2 < ... < hj, 2\u03bd respectively, where hj, \u03bd < hj, \u03bd+1 . Equivalently, often we denote these 2\u03bd indices\nsimply by hj, x , where x = 1, 2, ..., 2\u03bd and hj, 1 < hj, 2 < ... < hj, 2\u03bd . The set of 2\u03bd indices {hj, 1 , hj, 2 , ..., hj, 2\u03bd } is in\ngeneral a sub-set of the [Na \u2212 Nc ] charge-sequence indices h given in Eq. (43). The latter indices define the location\nof the charge-sequence rotated-electron doubly occupied and empty sites. We can also define the charge-sequence\nposition of the local c, \u03bd pseudoparticle which is defined as,\nhj, \u03bd + hj, \u03bd+1 \u2212 1\n.\n(46)\n2\nThe same definitions hold for the local s, \u03bd pseudoparticles with the indices hj, g and hj, \u03bd+g replaced by the indices\nlj, g and lj, \u03bd+g respectively, and thus the equivalent indices hj, x replaced by lj, x . The position of the local s, \u03bd\npseudoparticle in the effective electronic lattice is defined as [lj a] where,\nh\u0304j =\n\njlj, \u03bd + jlj, \u03bd+1\n,\n(47)\n2\n\u2217\nj = 1, 2, ..., Ns,\n\u03bd , and jl are the indices of Eq. (41) which define the location of the rotated-electron singly occupied\nsites. On the other hand, the spin-sequence position of the local s, \u03bd pseudoparticle is defined as,\nlj =\n\nl\u0304j =\n\nlj, \u03bd + lj, \u03bd+1 \u2212 1\n,\n2\n\n(48)\n\n\u2217\nwhere again j = 1, 2, ..., Ns,\n\u03bd . We note that the indices h\u0304j (and l\u0304j ) given in Eq. (46) (and Eq. (48)) which define\nthe charge-sequence (and spin-sequence) position of the local c, \u03bd pseudoparticle (and local s, \u03bd pseudoparticle) are\nalways positive integer numbers 1, 2, 3, .... According to Eq. (45) (and Eq. (47)) the position [hj a] (and [lj a]) of the\nlocal c, \u03bd pseudoparticle (and local s, \u03bd pseudoparticle) in the Na -site effective electronic lattice refers to a single point\ninside the 2\u03bd-site domain associated with such a quantum object. On the other hand, the charge-sequence position\n(and spin-sequence position) of the local c, \u03bd pseudoparticles (and local s, \u03bd pseudoparticles) defined by the index of\nEq. (46) (and Eq. (48)) refers to the location of that quantum object relative to the [Na \u2212 Nc ] sites (and Nc sites)\nof the charge (and spin) sequence only.\nBelow we clarify the following two issues: First, we find the rotated-electron distribution occupancies of the 2\u03bd\nsites which describe a local \u03b1, \u03bd pseudoparticle; Second, we find the rotated-electron site distribution occupancies\nh\nwhich define the N\u03b1,\n\u03bd charge-sequence (\u03b1 = c) or spin-sequence (\u03b1 = s) empty sites corresponding to the local \u03b1, \u03bd\npseudoparticle branch. This study reveals that the position in the effective electronic lattice of the sites associated with\nh\nthe N\u03b1,\n\u03bd charge-sequence or spin-sequence empty sites of each local \u03b1, \u03bd pseudoparticle branch is uniquely determined\nby the position of the local c pseudoparticles, local c, \u03bd pseudoparticles, and local s, \u03bd pseudoparticles. The same holds\nfor the locations of the Yang holons and HL spinons, as discussed above. Below we also confirm that for fixed values\n\u2217\nof the numbers N\u03b1, \u03bd and N\u03b1,\n\u03bd the number of occupancy configurations of the local \u03b1, \u03bd pseudoparticles is given by,\n\n\u0012 \u2217 \u0013\n\u2217\nN\u03b1,\nN\u03b1, \u03bd\n\u03bd!\n=\n.\nh !\nN\u03b1, \u03bd\nN\u03b1, \u03bd ! N\u03b1,\n\u03bd\n\n(49)\n\nWe classify each of the local \u03b1, \u03bd pseudoparticle occupancy configurations by providing the indices hj or lj given in\nEqs. (45) or (47) respectively, corresponding to the Nc, \u03bd and Ns, \u03bd pseudoparticle locations in the effective electronic\nlattice,\n(h1 , h2 , ..., hNc, \u03bd ) ,\n\n(50)\n\n(l1 , l2 , ..., lNs, \u03bd ) ,\n\n(51)\n\nand\n\nrespectively. From the combination of Eqs. (40) and (49) it follows that the number of occupancy configurations of\nthe local c and \u03b1, \u03bd pseudoparticles of a CPHS ensemble subspace is given by,\n\nNCP HS\u2212es\n\n\u0012 \u0013 Y Y\n\u221e \u0012 \u2217 \u0013\nN\u03b1, \u03bd\nNa\n.\n=\nNc \u03b1=c,s \u03bd=1 N\u03b1, \u03bd\n\n(52)\n\n\f16\nLet us denote each local state representing a specific local charge, spin, and c pseudoparticle sequence whose number\nfor a given CPHS ensemble subspace is given in Eq. (52) by,\n|(j1 , j2 , ..., jNc ); {(h1 , h2 , ..., hNc, \u03bd )}; {(l1 , l2 , ..., lNs, \u03bd )}i .\n\n(53)\n\n{(h1 , h2 , ..., hNc, \u03bd )} = (h1 , h2 , ..., hNc, 1 ); (h1 , h2 , ..., hNc, 2 ); (h1 , h2 , ..., hNc, 3 ); ... ,\n\n(54)\n\nHere\n\ngives the positions in the effective electronic lattice of the local c, \u03bd pseudoparticles belonging to branches with finite\noccupancy in the state under consideration and\n{(l1 , l2 , ..., lNs, \u03bd )} = (l1 , l2 , ..., lNs, 1 ); (l1 , l2 , ..., lNs, 2 ); (l1 , l2 , ..., lNs, 3 ); ... ,\n\n(55)\n\nprovides the positions in the same lattice of the local s, \u03bd pseudoparticles belonging to branches with finite occupancy\nin the same state.\nWe emphasize that the number (52) of such local states which equals the number of different local pseudoparticle\noccupancy configurations of a CPHS ensemble subspace indeed equals the dimension of such a subspace. It is straightforward to confirm from the results of Ref. [11] that the number of band-momentum energy eigenstates that span such\na CPHS ensemble subspace also has the same value. This suggests that the set of local states of form (53) is complete\nin that subspace, as is confirmed below. We find later on in this section that the generalization of the present analysis\nto rotated-electron site distribution configurations describing energy eigenstates with finite occupancies of \u00b11/2 Yang\nholons and \u00b11/2 HL spinons requires the introduction of the numbers Lc, \u22121/2 of \u22121/2 Yang holons and Ls, \u22121/2 of\n\u22121/2 HL spinons in the labelling of the local states (53).\nIn order to find the rotated-electron site distribution configurations which describe the internal structure of a local\n\u03b1, \u03bd pseudoparticle we use mainly the basic properties 3-III, 5-III, 6-III, and 7-III. Often we consider the specific\ncase of a local c, \u03bd pseudoparticle. The internal structure of such a quantum object is studied by considering first a\ncharge sequence constituted by \u03bd rotated-electron doubly occupied sites and \u03bd rotated-electron empty sites. The use\nof properties 5-III and 6-III leads to the finding of the specific rotated-electron site distribution configurations which\ndescribe the local c, \u03bd pseudoparticle. Property 7-III then states that the obtained rotated-electron site distribution\nconfigurations describe a local c, \u03bd pseudoparticle in any charge sequence.\nAccording to property 3-III, the internal structure of a local c, \u03bd pseudoparticle involves a number \u03bd\u0001 of rotatedelectron doubly occupied sites and an equal number of rotated-electron empty sites. There is a number 2\u03bd\n\u03bd of different\ndistribution configurations of these \u03bd rotated-electron doubly occupied sites and \u03bd rotated-electron empty sites. For\nsimplicity let us restrict the present preliminary analysis to charge sequences with \u03bd rotated-electron doubly occupied\nsites and an equal number of rotated-electron empty sites and without Yang holons. Below we find that a local\nc, \u03bd pseudoparticle is a superposition of a number 2\u03bd of the above rotated-electron site distribution configurations.\nFor \u03bd = 1 the local c, 1 pseudoparticle is a properly symmetrized superposition of the two available rotated-electron\nsite distribution configurations. For \u03bd = 2 the local c, 2 pseudoparticle is a properly symmetrized superposition of\nfour out of the six available rotated-electron site distribution configurations. Thus states including all possible six\ndifferent distribution configurations are a superposition of two states including two local c, 1 pseudoparticles and a\nlocal c, 2 pseudoparticle respectively. For \u03bd = 3 the local c, 3 pseudoparticle is a properly symmetrized superposition of\neight out of the twenty available rotated-electron site distribution configurations. States including all possible twenty\ndifferent distribution configurations are a superposition of three states including (i) three local c, 1 pseudoparticles,\n(ii) a local c, 1 pseudoparticle and a local c, 2 pseudoparticle, and (iii) a local c, 3 pseudoparticle. In the general\ncase\n\u0001\none has that the local c, \u03bd pseudoparticle is a properly symmetrized superposition of 2\u03bd out of the 2\u03bd\navailable\n\u03bd\n\u0001\nrotated-electron site distribution configurations. States including all possible 2\u03bd\ndifferent\ndistribution\nconfigurations\n\u03bd\nare aP\nsuperposition of several states including different numbers Nc, \u03bd \u2032 of c, \u03bd \u2032 pseudoparticles such that \u03bd \u2032 = 1, 2, ..., \u03bd\n\u03bd\nand \u03bd \u2032 =1 \u03bd \u2032 Nc, \u03bd \u2032 = \u03bd.\nAmong the 2\u03bd rotated-electron site distribution configurations of a c, \u03bd pseudoparticle there is always a distribution\nconfiguration where the first \u03bd sites of index hj, g and g = 1, 2, ..., \u03bd are doubly occupied by rotated electrons and the\nlast \u03bd sites of index hj, \u03bd+g and g = 1, 2, ..., \u03bd are free of rotated electrons. We represent such a local c, \u03bd pseudoparticle\nrotated-electron site distribution configuration of a charge sequence by,\n(\u2022hj, 1 , ..., \u2022hj, \u03bd , \u25e6hj, 1+\u03bd , ..., \u25e6hj, 2\u03bd ) .\n\n(56)\n\n\f17\nThe same applies to a local s, \u03bd pseudoparticle, the rotated-electron site distribution configuration of a spin sequence\ncorresponding to the one given in Eq. (56) being,\n(\u2193lj, 1 , ..., \u2193lj, \u03bd , \u2191lj, 1+\u03bd , ..., \u2191lj, 2\u03bd ) .\n\n(57)\n\nWe confirm below that the c, \u03bd pseudoparticle located in the effective electronic lattice at position [hj a] and the\ns, \u03bd pseudoparticle located in the same lattice at position [lj a] are described by the following properly symmetrized\nsuperposition of 2\u03bd rotated-electron site distribution configurations,\n2\u03bd\nhY\n\nei\u03c0hj, x D\u0302j, x\n\nx=1\n\n\u03bd\ni hY\n\ng=1\n\ni\n(1 \u2212 T\u0302c, \u03bd, j, g ) (\u2022hj, 1 , ..., \u2022hj, \u03bd , \u25e6hj, 1+\u03bd , ..., \u25e6hj, 2\u03bd ) ;\n\nj = 1, 2, ..., Nc, \u03bd ,\n\n(58)\n\nand\n\u03bd\nhY\n\ng=1\n\ni\n(1 \u2212 T\u0302s, \u03bd, j, g ) (\u2193lj, 1 , ..., \u2193lj, \u03bd , \u2191lj, 1+\u03bd , ..., \u2191lj, 2\u03bd ) ;\n\nj = 1, 2, ..., Ns, \u03bd ,\n\n(59)\n\nrespectively. Here and according to property 3-III, the site-hj, x rotated-electron double occupation operator D\u0302j, x has\neigenvalue 1 and 0 when that site is doubly occupied by rotated electrons and free of rotated electrons respectively,\nand the operator T\u0302c, \u03bd, j, g (and T\u0302s, \u03bd, j, g ) acts on the pair of sites of indices hj, g and hj, g+\u03bd (and lj, g and lj, g+\u03bd ) only.\nThis operator always acts onto rotated-electron site distribution configurations of the particular form illustrated in\nEq. (56) (and in Eq. (57)). From the application of this operator onto such a rotated-electron site distribution\nconfiguration a new distribution configuration is generated where the site of index hj, g is free of rotated electrons,\nthe site of index hj, g+\u03bd is doubly occupied by rotated electrons, and the occupancy of the other 2(\u03bd \u2212 1) sites remains\nunchanged, i.e.\nT\u0302c, \u03bd, j, g (..., \u2022hj, g , ..., \u25e6hj, g+\u03bd , ...) = (..., \u25e6hj, g , ..., \u2022hj, g+\u03bd , ...) .\n\n(60)\n\nThe same transformation law,\nT\u0302s, \u03bd, j, g (..., \u2193lj, g , ..., \u2191lj, g+\u03bd , ...) = (..., \u2191lj, g , ..., \u2193lj, g+\u03bd , ...) ,\n\n(61)\n\nis associated with the application of the operator T\u0302s, \u03bd, j, g onto an rotated-electron site distribution configuration of\nthe type illustrated in Eq. (57).\nThe 2\u03bd internal rotated-electron site distribution configurations on the right-hand side of Eq. (58) (and Eq. (59))\nare generated by considering that in each of the g = 1, 2, ..., \u03bd pairs of sites of indices hj g and hj, g+\u03bd , the site of\nindex hj g is doubly occupied by rotated electrons and the site of index hj, g+\u03bd is free of rotated electrons and vice\nversa. In general we call hj, x \u2194 hj, x\u2032 site pair a superposition of two rotated-electron distribution configurations of a\nrotated-electron doubly occupied site and a rotated-electron empty site where hj, x and hj, x\u2032 , such that x, x\u2032 = 1, ..., 2\u03bd\nand x\u2032 > x, are the indices of the two lattice sites involved. In the first rotated-electron site distribution configuration\nthe sites of indices hj, x and hj, x\u2032 are doubly occupied by rotated electrons and free of rotated electrons respectively.\nIn the second rotated-electron site distribution configuration the sites of indices hj, x and hj, x\u2032 are free of rotated\nelectrons and doubly occupied by rotated electrons respectively. The rotated-electron distribution configurations of\nall the remaining sites of the charge sequence except these two are identical. The\nhj, x \u2194 hj, x\u2032 ;\n\nx, x\u2032 = 1, ..., 2\u03bd ;\n\nx\u2032 > x ,\n\n(62)\n\nsite pair is defined as a superposition of these two rotated-electron site distributions configurations where the first\nand the second distributions are multiplied by a phase factor of 1 and \u22121 respectively.\nIn figure 1 we represent a hj, x \u2194 hj, x\u2032 site pair by two vertical lines connected by a horizontal line. The two\nvertical lines have the same height and connect the corresponding site of the charge sequence to the horizontal line.\nThus the two sites of a charge sequence connected by three such lines are assumed to be involved in a superposition\nof two rotated-electron site distribution configurations multiplied by the phase factors of 1 and \u22121 respectively, where\n\n\f18\naccording to the above recipe one of these sites is doubly occupied by rotated electrons and the other one is free of\nrotated electrons and vice versa. Similarly, we call\nlj, x \u2194 lj, x\u2032 ;\n\nx, x\u2032 = 1, ..., 2\u03bd ;\n\nx\u2032 > x ,\n\n(63)\n\nsite pair an equivalent superposition of two reotated-electron site distribution configurations of a spin sequence. The\ndefinitions are the same provided that we replace rotated-electron doubly occupied sites and rotated-electron empty\nsites by spin-down rotated-electron singly occupied sites and spin-up rotated-electron singly occupied sites respectively.\nSuch a rotated-electron singly occupied site pair is also graphically represented by the two vertical lines connected\nby a horizontal line plotted in Fig. 1. The concept of a site pair plays an important role in the description of the\nrotated-electron site distribution configurations of a local \u03b1, \u03bd pseudoparticle.\nIt is confirmed below that the rotated-electron site distribution configurations which describe a local \u03b1, \u03bd pseudoparticle always involve a number \u03bd of site pairs such that x = g and x\u2032 = g + \u03bd where g = 1, ..., \u03bd. Since there are\ntwo possible rotated-electron site occupancies for each pair and the number of pairs of each local \u03b1, \u03bd pseudoparticle is\n\u03bd, the total number of different internal rotated-electron site distribution configurations is indeed 2\u03bd . For example, in\nthe case of a c, \u03bd pseudoparticle located in the effective electronic lattice at the position [hj a], the 2\u03bd rotated-electron\nsite distribution configurations superposed in expression (58) are the following,\n2\nhY\n\nx=1\n\ni\nei\u03c0hj, x D\u0302j, x (1 \u2212 T\u0302c, 1, j, g ) (\u2022hj, 1 , \u25e6hj, 2 ) = \u2212ei\u03c0hj, 1 (\u2022hj, 1 , \u25e6hj, 2 ) + ei\u03c0hj, 2 (\u25e6hj, 1 , \u2022hj, 2 )\n\n(64)\n\nin the case of the c, 1 pseudoparticle,\n4\nhY\n\nei\u03c0hj, x D\u0302j, x\n\nx=1\n\n+ e\n\n2\ni hY\n\ni\n(1 \u2212 T\u0302c, 2, j, g ) (\u2022hj, 1 , \u2022hj, 2 , \u25e6hj, 3 , \u25e6hj, 4 ) =\n\ng=1\n\ni\u03c0[hj, 1 +hj, 2 ]\n\n(\u2022hj, 1 , \u2022hj, 2 , \u25e6hj, 3 , \u25e6hj, 4 ) \u2212 ei\u03c0[hj, 2 +hj, 3 ] (\u25e6hj, 1 , \u2022hj, 2 , \u2022hj, 3 , \u25e6hj, 4 )\n\n+ ei\u03c0[hj, 3 +hj, 4 ] (\u25e6hj, 1 , \u25e6hj, 2 , \u2022hj, 3 , \u2022hj, 4 ) \u2212 ei\u03c0[hj, 1 +hj, 4 ] (\u2022hj, 1 , \u25e6hj, 2 , \u25e6hj, 3 , \u2022hj, 4 ) ,\n\n(65)\n\nfor the c, 2 pseudoparticle, and\n6\nhY\n\nx=1\n\nei\u03c0hj, x D\u0302j, x\n\n3\ni hY\n\ng=1\n\ni\n(1 \u2212 T\u0302c, 3, j, g ) (\u2022hj, 1 , \u2022hj, 2 , \u2022hj, 3 , \u25e6hj, 4 , \u25e6hj, 5 , \u25e6hj, 6 ) =\n\n\u2212 e\n\ni\u03c0[hj, 1 +hj, 2 +hj, 3 ]\n\n(\u2022hj, 1 , \u2022hj, 2 , \u2022hj, 3 , \u25e6hj, 4 , \u25e6hj, 5 , \u25e6hj, 6 )\n\n+ e\n\ni\u03c0[hj, 2 +hj, 3 +hj, 4 ]\n\n(\u25e6hj, 1 , \u2022hj, 2 , \u2022hj, 3 , \u2022hj, 4 , \u25e6hj, 5 , \u25e6hj, 6 )\n\n\u2212 ei\u03c0[hj, 3 +hj, 4 +hj, 5 ] (\u25e6hj, 1 , \u25e6hj, 2 , \u2022hj, 3 , \u2022hj, 4 , \u2022hj, 5 , \u25e6hj, 6 )\n+ ei\u03c0[hj, 1 +hj, 3 +hj, 5 ] (\u2022hj, 1 , \u25e6hj, 2 , \u2022hj, 3 , \u25e6hj, 4 , \u2022hj, 5 , \u25e6hj, 6 )\n\u2212 ei\u03c0[hj, 1 +hj, 5 +hj, 6 ] (\u2022hj, 1 , \u25e6hj, 2 , \u25e6hj, 3 , \u25e6hj, 4 , \u2022hj, 5 , \u2022hj, 6 )\n+ ei\u03c0[hj, 1 +hj, 2 +hj, 6 ] (\u2022hj, 1 , \u2022hj, 2 , \u25e6hj, 3 , \u25e6hj, 4 , \u25e6hj, 5 , \u2022hj, 6 )\n\u2212 ei\u03c0[hj, 2 +hj, 4 +hj, 6 ] (\u25e6hj, 1 , \u2022hj, 2 , \u25e6hj, 3 , \u2022hj, 4 , \u25e6hj, 5 , \u2022hj, 6 )\n+ ei\u03c0[hj, 4 +hj, 5 +hj, 6 ] (\u25e6hj, 1 , \u25e6hj, 2 , \u25e6hj, 3 , \u2022hj, 4 , \u2022hj, 5 , \u2022hj, 6 ) ,\n\n(66)\n\nin the case of a c, 3 pseudoparticle. The 24 = 16 rotated-electron site distribution configurations of a c, 4 pseudoparticle\nlocated in the effective electronic lattice at position [hj a] are shown and discussed in Appendix B. Similar expressions\nfor local s, 1, s, 2, s, 3, or s, 4 pseudoparticles are obtained by replacing in Eqs. (64)-(66) and in Eq. (B1) of Appendix\nB respectively, the \u2022 and \u25e6 sites by \u2193 and \u2191 sites respectively, the hj,g indices by lj,g indices, and the local rotatedelectron double occupation operator phase factors by one.\nBefore using properties 3-III, 6-III, and 7-III to confirm the validity of the local pseudoparticle expressions (58)-(66),\nlet us check whether these expressions conform to the requirement of property 5-III. According to that requirement,\napplication of the off-diagonal generators of the SU (2) \u03b7-spin algebra given in Eq. (7) onto the superposition of the\n\n\f19\n2\u03bd internal rotated-electron site distribution configurations of a c, \u03bd pseudoparticle located in the effective electronic\nlattice at position [hj a] must give zero. It is straightforward to confirm from the analysis of the changes in the\nrotated-electron site distribution configurations generated by these operators that this requirement is fulfilled and\nthen,\n\nc\n\u015c\u00b1\n\n2\u03bd\nhY\n\nei\u03c0hj, x D\u0302j, x\n\nx=1\n\n\u03bd\ni hY\n\ng=1\n\ni\n(1 \u2212 T\u0302c, \u03bd, j, g )\n\n\u00d7 (\u2022hj, 1 , ..., \u2022hj, \u03bd , \u25e6hj, 1+\u03bd , ..., \u25e6hj, 2\u03bd ) = 0 ;\n\nj = 1, 2, ..., Nc, \u03bd .\n\n(67)\n\nThe same is valid for application of the off-diagonal generators of the SU (2) spin algebra given in Eq. (8) onto the\nsuperposition of the 2\u03bd internal rotated-electron site distribution configurations of a s, \u03bd pseudoparticle located in the\neffective electronic lattice at position [lj a],\ns\n\u015c\u00b1\n\n\u03bd\nhY\n\ng=1\n\ni\n(1 \u2212 T\u0302s, \u03bd, j, g ) (\u2193lj, 1 , ..., \u2193lj, \u03bd , \u2191lj, 1+\u03bd , ..., \u2191lj, 2\u03bd ) = 0 ;\n\nj = 1, 2, ..., Ns, \u03bd .\n\n(68)\n\nIn order to confirm the validity of the pseudoparticle expressions (58)-(66), let us follow property 5-III and consider\nagain a local charge sequence with no Yang holons and constituted by a number \u03bd of rotated-electron doubly occupied\nsites and a number \u03bd of rotated-electron empty sites. If we request that the rotated-electron distribution configurations\nof these 2\u03bd sites describe a single c, \u03bd pseudoparticle, according to the restrictions imposed by the Bethe-ansatz solution\n[11], the associated local charge sequence must be characterized by the following numbers,\nMc = 2\u03bd ;\n\nNc, \u03bd = 1 ;\n\nNc,h \u03bd = 0 ;\n\nNc, \u03bd \u2032 = 0 ,\n\n\u03bd \u2032 6= \u03bd .\n\n(69)\n\nSuch a local charge sequence has a single c, \u03bd pseudoparticle and no c, \u03bd pseudoparticle empty sites. This corresponds\nto an effective c, \u03bd pseudoparticle lattice constituted by a single site located in the effective electronic lattice at [h1 a].\nThat site is occupied by a c, \u03bd pseudoparticle. In this limiting case in order to ensure periodic boundary conditions\nfor the original electronic problem it is required that the charge sequence should be properly symmetrized by the\nmethod used in Ref. [51]. Such a symmetrization involves the operator T\u0302C of Eq. (34).\nA result of key importance is that the fulfillment of the requirement of property 5-III imposes that the superposition\nof rotated-electron distribution configurations of the \u03bd doubly occupied sites and \u03bd empty sites (and \u03bd spin-down singly\noccupied sites and \u03bd spin-up singly occupied sites) of such a c, \u03bd pseudoparticle (and s, \u03bd pseudoparticle) must be\nexpressed in the form of a number \u03bd of h1, x \u2194 h1, x\u2032 site pairs (and l1, x \u2194 l1, x\u2032 site pairs) where x and x\u2032 are such\nthat x\u2032 > x and have the values x, x\u2032 = 1, 2, ..., 2\u03bd. There is a number (2\u03bd \u2212 1)!! of possible different choices for these\n\u03bd h1, x \u2194 h1, x\u2032 (and l1, x \u2194 l1, x\u2032 ) site pairs. Fortunately, the use of requirement 6-III reveals that only one of these\n(2\u03bd \u2212 1)!! choices corresponds to the c, \u03bd pseudoparticle (and s, \u03bd pseudoparticle). The remaining (2\u03bd \u2212 1)!! \u2212 1 choices\ncan be expressed\nas a superposition of several states described by differentPnumbers Nc, \u03bd \u2032 of c, \u03bd \u2032 pseudoparticles\nP\u03bd\n\u03bd\nsuch that \u03bd \u2032 =1 \u03bd \u2032 Nc, \u03bd \u2032 = \u03bd (and Ns, \u03bd \u2032 of s, \u03bd \u2032 pseudoparticles such that \u03bd \u2032 =1 \u03bd \u2032 Ns, \u03bd \u2032 = \u03bd). Moreover, the fact\nthat the symmetrized rotated-electron site distribution configuration which describes the c, \u03bd pseudoparticle (and\ns, \u03bd pseudoparticle) involves a number \u03bd of site pairs implies that it corresponds to a state with charge (and spin)\nmomentum kC = \u03c0/a (and kS = \u03c0/a). The possible values of such a charge momentum are given in Eq. (36). For\nother values of charge momentum that state cannot be described in terms of a number \u03bd of site pairs and thus the\nrequirement introduced in property 5-III is not fulfilled.\nFor instance, when \u03bd = 1 application of the basic properties 3-III, 5-III, and 6-III leads uniquely to the following\ndescription of the c, 1 pseudoparticle,\n2\nhY\n\nei\u03c0h1, x D\u03021, x\n\nx=1\n\n1\ni X\n\n\u03bdC =0\n\n\u0010 \u0011\u03bdC\n(\u2022h1, 1 , \u25e6h1, 2 ) .\nei\u03c0\u03bdC T\u0302C\n\n(70)\n\nThis is the product of a rotated-electron double-occupation operator phase factor with a symmetrized charge sequence.\nThe charge sequence defined by Eq. (70) can also be written as,\n2\nhY\n\nx=1\n\ni\nei\u03c0h1, x D\u03021, x (1 \u2212 T\u0302c, 1, 1, 1 ) (\u2022h1, 1 , \u25e6h1, 2 ) ,\n\n(71)\n\n\f20\nin agreement with the general expression (58) and the local c, 1 pseudoparticle expression (64). For j = 1, x = 1, and\nx\u2032 = 2 Fig. 1 describes the h1, 1 \u2194 h1, 2 site pair associated with this c, 1 pseudoparticle.\nNext we consider the case \u03bd = 2. The fulfillment of the requirement introduced in property 5-III alone imposes in\nthis case that the superposition of rotated-electron distribution configurations of the two doubly occupied sites and two\nempty sites representative of a c, 2 pseudoparticle must be expressed in the form of two h1, x \u2194 h1, x\u2032 site pairs where\nx and x\u2032 are such that x\u2032 > x and have the values x, x\u2032 = 1, 2, 3, 4. There are three possible different choices for the\nsuperposition of rotated-electron distribution configurations formed by two site pairs. These choices correspond to the\nfollowing sets: (a) {h1, 1 \u2194 h1, 4 ; h1, 2 \u2194 h1, 3 }, (b) {h1, 1 \u2194 h1, 3 ; h1, 2 \u2194 h1, 4 }, and (c) {h1, 1 \u2194 h1, 2 ; h1, 3 \u2194 h1, 4 }.\nAccording to property 7-III, the charge sequence (c) is excluded because it describes two c, 1 pseudoparticles and thus\nthere remain two possible choices for the c, 2 pseudoparticle. Figure 2 represents the charge sequences corresponding\nto the choices (a) and (b). Each of the h1, x \u2194 h1, x\u2032 site pairs are represented as in Fig. 1 with j = 1. The figure\nshows how the rotated-electron site distribution configurations of these two charge sequences change as a result of\na cyclic permutation which transforms the first site of the charge sequence to the last site and multiplies the final\nstate by a phase factor of \u22121. This phase factor arises from the required kC = \u03c0/a charge momentum. We note that\nthe single h1, 1 \u2194 h1, 2 site pair descriptive of the c, 1 pseudoparticle given in expressions (70) and (71) transforms\ninto itself under such a transformation. On the other hand, in the present case the rotated-electron site distribution\nconfiguration (a) transforms onto two c, 1 pseudoparticles whereas the rotated-electron site distribution configuration\n(b) transforms onto itself. Thus according to property 6-III only the rotated-electron site distribution configuration\n(b) is properly symmetrized and describes the c, 2 pseudoparticle. Moreover, only this sequence can be written as a\nsymmetrized charge sequence of charge momentum kC = \u03c0/a. Again, such a symmetrized charge sequence can also\nbe written in the form given in the general Eq. (58) and in the local c, 2 pseudoparticle expression (65). The two\nequivalent expressions read,\n4\nhY\n\n=\n\nei\u03c0h1, x D\u0302j, x\n\nx=1\n\n3\ni X\n\n\u0010 \u0011\u03bdC\n(\u2022h1, 1 , \u2022h1, 2 , \u25e6h1, 3 , \u25e6h1, 4 )\nei\u03c0\u03bdC T\u0302C\n\n4\nhY\n\nei\u03c0h1, x D\u0302j, x\n\n2\ni hY\n\ni\n(1 \u2212 T\u0302c, 2, 1, g ) (\u2022h1, 1 , \u2022h1, 2 , \u25e6h1, 3 , \u25e6h1, 4 ) .\n\nx=1\n\n\u03bdC =0\n\n(72)\n\ng=1\n\nLet us now consider the case \u03bd = 3. Again the fulfillment of the requirement introduced in property 5-III imposes\nthat the superposition of rotated-electron distribution configurations of the three doubly occupied sites and three\nempty sites representative of a c, 3 pseudoparticle should be expressed in the form of three h1, x \u2194 h1, x\u2032 site pairs\nwhere x and x\u2032 are such that x\u2032 > x and have the values x, x\u2032 = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. There are fifteen different possible choices\nfor superposition of rotated-electron site distribution configurations formed by three site pairs. However, only one of\nthese charge sequences can be written in the form of symmetrized charge sequence of charge momentum kC = \u03c0/a.\nFor example, in Fig. 3 we represent the charge sequences (a) {h1, 1 \u2194 h1, 3 ; h1, 2 \u2194 h1, 5 ; h1, 4 \u2194 h1, 6 } and (b)\n{h1, 1 \u2194 h1, 4 ; h1, 2 \u2194 h1, 5 ; h1, 3 \u2194 h1, 6 }. The figure shows how the rotated-electron site distribution configurations\nof these two charge sequences change as a result of a cyclic permutation which transforms the first site of the charge\nsequence to the last site and multiplies the final state by a phase factor of \u22121. Both the rotated-electron site\ndistribution configuration (a) and all remaining possible rotated-electron site distribution configurations constituted\nby three h1, x \u2194 h1, x\u2032 site pairs except the rotated-electron site distribution configuration (b) do not transform onto\nthemselves. The latter rotated-electron site distribution configuration transforms onto itself, as confirmed by analysis\nof the figure. Thus according to property 6-III only the rotated-electron site distribution configuration (b) is properly\nsymmetrized and describes the local c, 3 pseudoparticle. Only this sequence can be written in terms of a symmetrized\ncharge sequence of charge momentum kC = \u03c0/a. Again, such symmetrized charge sequence can also be written in\nthe form given in the general Eq. (58) and in the local c, 3 expression (66). The two equivalent expressions are the\nfollowing,\n\n\f21\n\n6\nhY\n\nx=1\n\n+\n\n5\n\u0010 \u0011\u03bdc\ni X\n(\u2022h1, 1 , \u2022h1, 2 , \u2022h1, 3 , \u25e6h1, 4 , \u25e6h1, 5 , \u25e6h1, 6 )\nei\u03c0\u03bdC T\u0302C\nei\u03c0h1, x D\u0302j, x {\n\u03bdC =0\n\n1\nX\n\nei\u03c0\u03bdC T\u0302C\n\n6\nhY\n\nei\u03c0h1, x D\u0302j, x\n\n\u03bdC =0\n\n=\n\n\u0011\u03bdc\n\n\u0010\n\nx=1\n\n(\u25e6h1, 1 , \u2022h1, 2 , \u25e6h1, 3 , \u2022h1, 4 , \u25e6h1, 5 , \u2022h1, 6 )}\n\n3\ni hY\n\ng=1\n\ni\n(1 \u2212 T\u0302c, 3, 1, g ) (\u2022h1, 1 , \u2022h1, 2 , \u2022h1, 3 , \u25e6h1, 4 , \u25e6h1, 5 , \u25e6h1, 6 ) .\n\n(73)\n\nNote that in this case one needs two symmetrized charge sequences to reach the c, 3 expression (66) upon application\nof the operator T\u0302C onto these charge sequences two and six times respectively. However, in agreement with properties\n5-III and 6-III, the state obtained from the superposition of these two charge sequences is an eigenstate of the\ncharge momentum operator with eigenvalue kC = \u03c0/a. Also the c, \u03bd pseudoparticles belonging to branches such that\n\u03bd > 3 are a superposition of several such symmetrized charge sequences. However, always the state obtained from the\nsuperposition of several charge sequences is an eigenstate of the charge momentum operator with eigenvalue kC = \u03c0/a.\nThat state can also be expressed in the general form given in Eq. (58).\nAs a last example we provide the expression in terms of symmetrized charge sequences of the rotated-electron site\ndistribution configurations representative of a c, 4 pseudoparticle. This can again be written both (i) in the form given\nin Eqs. (58) and in Eq. (B1) of Appendix B and (ii) as a superposition of symmetrized charge sequences. The two\nequivalent expressions are in this case given by,\n8\nhY\n\nx=1\n\n+\n\n7\nX\n\n=\n\n8\nhY\n\n\u03bdC =0\n\nx=1\n\n7\ni X\n\u0010 \u0011\u03bdC\nei\u03c0h1, x D\u0302j, x {\n(\u2022h1, 1 , \u2022h1, 2 , \u2022h1, 3 , \u2022h1, 4 , \u25e6h1, 5 , \u25e6h1, 6 , \u25e6h1, 7 , \u25e6h1, 8 )\nei\u03c0\u03bdC T\u0302C\n\u03bdC =0\n\nei\u03c0\u03bdC\n\n\u0010 \u0011\u03bdC\n(\u2022h1, 1 , \u25e6h1, 2 , \u2022h1, 3 , \u25e6h1, 4 , \u25e6h1, 5 , \u2022h1, 6 , \u25e6h1, 7 , \u2022h1, 8 )}\nT\u0302C\n\nei\u03c0h1, x D\u0302j, x\n\n4\ni hY\n\ni\n(1 \u2212 T\u0302c, 4, 1, g ) (\u2022h1, 1 , \u2022h1, 2 , \u2022h1, 3 , \u2022h1, 4 , \u25e6h1, 5 , \u25e6h1, 6 , \u25e6h1, 7 , \u25e6h1, 8 ) .\n\n(74)\n\ng=1\n\nAlso in this case one needs more than one symmetrized charge sequence to reach the c, 4 expression (B1) given in\nAppendix A. Again, the state obtained from the superposition of the involved charge sequences is an eigenstate of\nthe charge momentum operator with eigenvalue kC = \u03c0/a.\nFor the case of charge (and spin) sequences constituted by several local c, \u03bd pseudoparticles (and local s, \u03bd pseudoparticles) belonging to one or several \u03bd = 1, 2, ... branches and by Yang holons (and HL spinons) the internal structure of\nthe local c, \u03bd pseudoparticles (and local s, \u03bd pseudoparticles) is given by Eq. (58) (and Eq. (59)). This result follows\nfrom the basic property 7-III. According to that property the rotated-electron distribution configurations of the \u03bd\ndoubly occupied sites and \u03bd empty sites (and \u03bd spin-down singly occupied sites and \u03bd spin-up singly occupied sites)\nwhich describe the internal structure, a c, \u03bd pseudoparticle (and s, \u03bd pseudoparticle) located in the effective electronic\nlattice at position [hj a] (and [lj a]) are the same as for the above limiting charge (and spin) sequence constituted by\na single pseudoparticle. We will in the ensuing section confirm that in agreement with property 8-III, this ensures the\nperiodic boundary conditions of the original electronic problem provided that the band-momentum energy eigenstates\nare suitable Fourier-transform superpositions of the local charge sequences with band-momentum values obeying Eqs.\n(37) and (38).\nHowever, whether inside the domain of 2\u03bd sites of a local c, \u03bd pseudoparticle there can be sites with index jh such\nthat jhj, 1 < jh < jhj, 2\u03bd and which sites are occupied by Yang holons or other local c, \u03bd \u2032 pseudoparticles remains an\nopen question. This problem is absent in the limiting case we considered here where the charge sequence is constituted\nby a number 2\u03bd of sites of the effective electronic lattice. This issue is closely related to the definition of the local c, \u03bd\npseudoparticle charge-sequence empty sites which is discussed in the following. A similar problem occurs for the spin\nsequences.\n\n\f22\nB.\n\nTHE LOCAL \u03b1, \u03bd PSEUDOPARTICLE EMPTY SITES AND THE MOVING PSEUDOPARTICLE\nELEMENTARY STEPS\n\nIn the definition of the Nc,h \u03bd charge-sequence empty sites of a local c, \u03bd pseudoparticle it is useful to consider different\ncharge sequences where all remaining local c, \u03bd \u2032 pseudoparticles except that specific local c, \u03bd pseudoparticle keep their\ncharge-sequence positions h\u0304j defined in Eq. (46). Below we call steady local c, \u03bd \u2032 pseudoparticles the former local\npseudoparticles whose charge-sequence positions h\u0304j remain unchanged. Obviously, any local pseudoparticle can be\nchosen to be the moving pseudoparticle. This just refers to a set of different charge sequences where the charge-sequence\nposition of that quantum object changes whereas the charge-sequence positions of the remaining local pseudoparticles\nremain unchanged. We note that according to Eq. (46) the charge-sequence position of a local c, \u03bd pseudoparticle can\nremain unchanged in spite of the movements of some of its 2\u03bd sites, as we confirm below. Concerning the definition\nof the Nc,h \u03bd charge-sequence empty sites of a local c, \u03bd pseudoparticle, from the use of properties 1-III to 8-III and of\nother properties of the 1D Hubbard model we find the following distribution configuration properties:\n1-IV Let us consider a set of rotated-electron doubly occupied and/or rotated-electron empty sites located at\npositions [jh a] where according to Eqs. (43) and (44) the index h has the values h = 1, 2, ..., [Na \u2212 Nc ]. Moreover,\nwe consider that all of these sites are located inside the domain of sites of a local c, \u03bd pseudoparticle and thus their\nindices jh are such that jhj, 1 < jh < jhj, 2\u03bd and jh 6= jhj, x where x = 1, 2, ..., 2\u03bd. This property states that the\nset of rotated-electron doubly occupied/empty sites of index jh obeying these inequalities cannot correspond to sites\noccupied by Yang holons or to any of the 2\u03bd \u2032 sites of the charge sequence associated with local c, \u03bd \u2032 pseudoparticles\nbelonging to branches such that \u03bd \u2032 > \u03bd. Thus such a set of rotated-electron doubly occupied or empty sites can\nonly correspond to sub-sets of 2\u03bd \u2032 sites of the charge sequence associated with local c, \u03bd \u2032 pseudoparticles belonging to\nbranches such that \u03bd \u2032 \u2264 \u03bd.\n2-IV Let us consider a local c, \u03bd pseudoparticle and a local c, \u03bd \u2032 pseudoparticle belonging to the same charge sequence\nand to branches such that \u03bd \u2264 \u03bd \u2032 . Moreover, we consider that there are no charge-sequence local pseudoparticles\ninside the 2\u03bd \u2032 -site domain of the c, \u03bd \u2032 pseudoparticle other than the c, \u03bd pseudoparticle. The description of cases\ninvolving more than two local pseudoparticles can be easily reached by generalization of the two-pseudoparticle\nsituation considered here. Then the 2\u03bd sites of the charge sequence associated with the local c, \u03bd pseudoparticle are\nlocated either outside the domain of 2\u03bd \u2032 sites of the local c, \u03bd \u2032 pseudoparticle limited in the left and right ends by the\nsites of index hj, 1 and hj, 2\u03bd \u2032 respectively, or are all located inside that domain. If the 2\u03bd sites are located inside the\ndomain of these 2\u03bd \u2032 sites there is a number 2\u03bd \u2032 \u2212 1 of permitted positions for the c, \u03bd pseudoparticle. In each of these\npermitted positions all of the 2\u03bd sites of the local c, \u03bd pseudoparticle are located between two first neighboring sites\nof indices hj,x and hj \u2032 ,x+1 of the local c, \u03bd \u2032 pseudoparticle. These permitted positions correspond to the neighboring\nsites of indices hj,x and hj \u2032 ,x+1 such that x = 1, ..., 2\u03bd \u2032 \u2212 1.\n3-IV Let us consider again the local c, \u03bd pseudoparticle and the local c, \u03bd \u2032 pseudoparticle referred to in property 2-IV.\nThe charge-sequence position h\u0304j given in Eq. (46) of such a steady local c, \u03bd \u2032 pseudoparticle remains unchanged in all\npossible 2\u03bd \u2032 \u22121 positions of the local c, \u03bd pseudoparticle while passing its 2\u03bd \u2032 -site domain. The inverse statement is even\nstronger. It is required that when a local c, \u03bd \u2032 pseudoparticle belonging to a branch such that \u03bd \u2032 \u2265 \u03bd passes a steady\nlocal c, \u03bd pseudoparticle, the position in the effective electronic lattice of all the 2\u03bd sites of the latter pseudoparticle\nmust remain unchanged. Moreover, the 2\u03bd \u2032 \u22121 possible different positions of the 2\u03bd sites of the local c, \u03bd pseudoparticle\ninside the site domain of the local c, \u03bd \u2032 pseudoparticle must be the same when the local c, \u03bd pseudoparticle passes the\nsteady local c, \u03bd \u2032 pseudoparticle from its left to its right-hand side and vice versa. Also the relative positions of the\ntwo quantum objects when the local c, \u03bd pseudoparticle passes the steady local c, \u03bd \u2032 pseudoparticle and when the local\nc, \u03bd \u2032 pseudoparticle passes the steady local c, \u03bd pseudoparticle must be the same. However, note that although these\nrelative positions are the same, when a local c, \u03bd \u2032 pseudoparticle belonging to a branch such that \u03bd \u2032 \u2265 \u03bd passes a steady\nlocal c, \u03bd pseudoparticle it does not occupy any of the 2\u03bd sites of the effective electronic lattice occupied by the latter\nlocal pseudoparticle. Thus the positions in the lattice of these 2\u03bd sites remain indeed unchanged. A last requirement\nis that the positions of all 2\u03bd \u2032 sites of a steady local c, \u03bd \u2032 pseudoparticle belonging to a branch such that \u03bd \u2032 \u2265 \u03bd must\nbe the same in the rotated-electron site distribution configurations before and after it is passed by the moving local\nc, \u03bd pseudoparticle. If the local c, \u03bd pseudoparticle is moving from the left to the right-hand side of the steady local\nc, \u03bd \u2032 pseudoparticle, before and after is meant here as the rotated-electron site distribution configurations where the\n2\u03bd sites of the former quantum object are located outside the domain of 2\u03bd \u2032 sites of the steady local pseudoparticle\nand on its right and left hand sides respectively.\n4-IV Corresponding rules are also valid for the case of the spin sequences and local s, \u03bd pseudoparticles.\n\n\f23\nA simple example of a domain constituted by fourteen sites of a permitted charge sequence is represented in Fig.\n4. In such a figure the hj, g \u2194 hj, g+\u03bd site pairs of the local c, \u03bd pseudoparticles are represented as in Figs. 1 to 3. The\nsix sites with no vertical lines correspond to empty sites associated with +1/2 Yang holons. There are two local c, 1\npseudoparticles and a local c, 2 pseudoparticle in the charge-sequence domain represented in the figure.\nIn order to confirm the validity of the counting of rotated-electron site distribution occupancies leading to expression (49), let us use the properties 1-IV to 4-IV in the classification of the different Nc,\u2217 \u03bd possible positions of a local\nc, \u03bd pseudoparticle in the effective electronic lattice. Our analysis can be easily generalized to the case of a s, \u03bd pseudoparticle. Our study includes the introduction of the concept of 2\u03bd-leg caterpillar step, where the 2\u03bd-leg caterpillar is\nnothing but the 2\u03bd-site pseudoparticle block associated with the moving c, \u03bd pseudoparticle. For simplicity we consider\na charge sequence such that Nc, \u03bd = 1 for the \u03bd branch. However, the generalization of our results to branches with\nfinite occupancy of several local pseudoparticles is straightforward. As mentioned above, the possible positions of\nsuch a pseudoparticle correspond to a number Nc,\u2217 \u03bd of different charge sequences where the charge-sequence positions\nof all remaining quantum objects remain unchanged. Thus these Nc,\u2217 \u03bd charge sequences differ in the position of the\nc, \u03bd pseudoparticle relative to the other quantum objects. The above property 3-IV states that the charge-sequence\nposition h\u0304j given in Eq. (46) of all quantum objects except that of the moving c, \u03bd pseudoparticle must remain\nunchanged in all these Nc,\u2217 \u03bd charge sequences. Let us confirm that the charge-sequence position of a steady local c, \u03bd \u2032\npseudoparticle belonging to a branch such that \u03bd \u2032 > \u03bd indeed remains unchanged when it is passed by a local c, \u03bd\npseudoparticle, in spite of changes of the positions in the effective electronic lattice of some of its 2\u03bd \u2032 sites.\nWe start by considering the case of a local c, \u03bd\u0304 pseudoparticle where \u03bd = \u03bd\u0304 denotes the largest \u03bd value of the c, \u03bd\npseudoparticle branches with finite occupancy in the charge sequence. According to Eq. (17), in this case the number\nof local c, \u03bd\u0304 pseudoparticle empty sites is given by Nc,h \u03bd\u0304 = Lc and equals the number of Yang holons. The different\npossible positions of a c, \u03bd\u0304 pseudoparticle can be achieved by elementary steps in the charge sequence where each of its\n2\u03bd\u0304 sites moves forward by a single site of the charge sequence. If the movement is from the left to the right-hand side,\nthe 2\u03bd\u0304 th pseudoparticle site of index hj, 2\u03bd\u0304 moves into the site previously occupied by a Yang holon. The remaining\n2\u03bd\u0304 \u2212 1 pseudoparticle sites of index hj, x move into the site previously associated with the pseudoparticle site of index\nhj, x+1 where x = 1, ..., 2\u03bd\u0304 \u2212 1. Finally, the Yang holon removed from the site newly associated with the pseudoparticle\nsite of index hj, 2\u03bd\u0304 moves into the site previously associated with the first pseudoparticle site of index hj, 1 . We call\nsuch an elementary collective step of the 2\u03bd\u0304 pseudoparticle sites 2\u03bd\u0304-leg caterpillar step. According to such an analogy\nthe 2\u03bd\u0304 legs refer to these sites and the caterpillar refers to the local pseudoparticle. While each of these legs moves\nforward by a charge-sequence site, the whole caterpillar itself also moves forward by a single charge-sequence site. The\nnet result of such a 2\u03bd\u0304-leg caterpillar step is that the compact domain of 2\u03bd\u0304 pseudoparticle sites interchanges position\nwith a Yang holon. When such a moving c, \u03bd\u0304 pseudoparticle passes a steady local c, \u03bd pseudoparticle, each of its 2\u03bd\u0304\nsites jump the 2\u03bd sites of the latter local pseudoparticle. Thus the 2\u03bd\u0304-leg caterpillar moves forward like the 2\u03bd sites\nof such a steady local c, \u03bd pseudoparticle do not exist in the charge sequence. As we discuss below, the construction\nof the corresponding effective c, \u03bd\u0304 pseudoparticle lattice mentioned in property 8-III involves omission of the sites of\nthe effective electronic lattice belonging to the 2\u03bd-site domains of such a local c, \u03bd pseudoparticles. Moreover, for such\nan effective c, \u03bd\u0304 pseudoparticle lattice the 2\u03bd\u0304-site domain of the c, \u03bd\u0304 pseudoparticles is seen as a point-like occupied\nsite. Thus in the particular case of the \u03bd\u0304 branch such an effective lattice has Nc,\u2217 \u03bd\u0304 = Lc + Nc, \u03bd\u0304 sites and a number\nNc,h \u03bd\u0304 = Lc free of c, \u03bd\u0304 pseudoparticles, as we confirm below.\nLet us consider now the case of a general local c, \u03bd pseudoparticle belonging to a branch such that 1 \u2264 \u03bd \u2264 \u03bd\u0304. For\nsimplicity we keep the assumption that Nc, \u03bd = 1 for the \u03bd branch. We consider a given charge sequence where the\nc, \u03bd pseudoparticle is located in the effective electronic lattice at position [hj a]. It follows from property 4-III that\nthe Nc,h \u03bd remaining possible positions of the local c, \u03bd pseudoparticle in the charge sequence define the positions of\nP\u221e\nthe local c, \u03bd pseudoparticle charge-sequence empty sites. Out of these Nc,h \u03bd = Lc + 2 \u03bd \u2032 =\u03bd+1 (\u03bd \u2032 \u2212 \u03bd)Nc, \u03bd \u2032 possible\npositions, Lc is the number of positions associated with Yang holons. Again, the different positions of the moving local\nc, \u03bd pseudoparticle can be achieved by 2\u03bd-leg caterpillar steps. The net result of such a 2\u03bd-leg caterpillar step is that\nthe compact domain constituted by the 2\u03bd c, \u03bd pseudoparticle sites interchanges position with a Yang holon or with a\nsite of a hj \u2032 , g\u2032 \u2194 hj \u2032 , g\u2032 +\u03bd \u2032 pair of a steady local c, \u03bd \u2032 pseudoparticle belonging to a branch such that \u03bd \u2032 > \u03bd. A 2\u03bd-leg\ncaterpillar step is defined here as in the case of the above moving c, \u03bd\u0304 pseudoparticle. If the movement is from the\nleft to the right-hand side, the local c, \u03bd pseudoparticle site of index hj, 2\u03bd moves into the site previously occupied by\na Yang holon or into one of the two sites previously associated with a local c, \u03bd \u2032 pseudoparticle hj \u2032 , g\u2032 \u2194 hj \u2032 , g\u2032 +\u03bd \u2032 site\npair. The remaining 2\u03bd \u2212 1 sites of the local c, \u03bd pseudoparticle of index hj, x such that x = 1, ..., 2\u03bd \u2212 1, move into the\nsite previously associated with the local c, \u03bd pseudoparticle site of index hj, x+1 where again x = 1, ..., 2\u03bd \u2212 1. Finally,\nthe Yang holon or c, \u03bd \u2032 pseudoparticle site associated with the local hj \u2032 , g\u2032 \u2194 hj \u2032 , g\u2032 +\u03bd \u2032 site pair which was removed\nfrom the site newly associated with the local c, \u03bd pseudoparticle site of index h1, 2\u03bd , moves into the site previously\nassociated with the local c, \u03bd pseudoparticle site of index hj, 1 . Again, the net result of such a 2\u03bd-leg caterpillar step\nis that the local c, \u03bd pseudoparticle moves forward by a single charge-sequence site.\nLet us consider that in the initial rotated-electron site distribution configuration the moving c, \u03bd pseudoparticle\n\n\f24\nis located on the left-hand side of the steady local c, \u03bd \u2032 pseudoparticle. Thus in the final state just after passing\nthe latter pseudoparticle, the c, \u03bd pseudoparticle will occupy in the charge sequence a domain of 2\u03bd sites located\non the right-hand side of the c, \u03bd \u2032 pseudoparticle site domain. According to property 3-IV, in both the initial and\nfinal rotated-electron site distribution configurations all 2\u03bd \u2032 sites of the latter quantum object remain the same. For\nsimplicity we consider that in the initial rotated-electron site distribution configuration, the 2\u03bd charge-sequence sites\nlocated just on the right-hand side of the steady local c, \u03bd \u2032 pseudoparticle are occupied by Yang holons. However,\nour results can be generalized to rotated-electron site distribution configurations where these sites are occupied by\na third pseudoparticle. Another case which we could consider is when the moving local pseudoparticle passes two\nsteady local c, \u03bd \u2032 and c, \u03bd \u2032\u2032 pseudoparticles such that one of them is located within the site domain of the other one.\nFrom the systematic use of the properties 1-IV to 4-IV one can describe the movements of a local c, \u03bd pseudoparticle\nwhen it passes any rotated-electron site distribution configuration involving several steady local pseudoparticles.\nAccording to property 2-IV the 2\u03bd sites of a local c, \u03bd pseudoparticle can have 2\u03bd \u2032 \u2212 1 different positions inside\nthe 2\u03bd \u2032 -site domain of a local c, \u03bd \u2032 pseudoparticle belonging to a branch such that \u03bd \u2032 > \u03bd. We consider that in the\ninitial rotated-electron site distribution configuration, the local c, \u03bd and c, \u03bd \u2032 pseudoparticles are located side by side\nin the charge sequence. Thus these two quantum objects occupy together a compact 2(\u03bd + \u03bd \u2032 )-site domain. By simple\ncounting arguments it is straightforward to realize that in order to reach each of these permitted positions each of the\n2\u03bd sites of the local c, \u03bd pseudoparticle must perform a jump of 2\u03bd sites in the charge sequence somewhere inside the\n\u2032\n2\u03bdP\n-site domain of the steady local c, \u03bd \u2032 pseudoparticle. This result is consistent with the expression of the number\n\u221e\n2 \u03bd \u2032 =\u03bd+1 (\u03bd \u2032 \u2212 \u03bd)N\u03b1, \u03bd \u2032 of the available positions for the moving local c, \u03bd pseudoparticle involving sites of steady\nlocal c, \u03bd \u2032 pseudoparticles belonging to branches such that \u03bd \u2032 > \u03bd. This expression reveals that when located inside\nthe site domain of such a pseudoparticle each of the 2\u03bd sites of the local c, \u03bd pseudoparticle can move into a possible\n2(\u03bd \u2032 \u2212 \u03bd) sites out of the 2\u03bd \u2032 total number of sites of the steady local c, \u03bd \u2032 pseudoparticle. This agrees with the\nabove result obtained from counting arguments alone. We note that the number of charge-sequence sites jumped by\neach local c, \u03bd caterpillar leg equals precisely 2\u03bd, the number of sites of such a c, \u03bd pseudoparticle. Thus these jumps\nensure that the position in the effective electronic lattice of all the 2\u03bd \u2032 sites of the steady local c, \u03bd \u2032 pseudoparticle\nremains unchanged after the c, \u03bd passes it, as requested by the property 3-IV. This result also applies to the general\nsituation when a moving local c, \u03bd pseudoparticle passes a domain containing several local steady c, \u03bd \u2032 pseudoparticles\nbelonging to branches such that \u03bd \u2032 > \u03bd. Also in the general situation that each of the legs of the moving caterpillar\nuses 2(\u03bd \u2032 \u2212 \u03bd) possible sites of each steady local c, \u03bd \u2032 pseudoparticle, out of a total of 2\u03bd \u2032 sites.\nThe question which arises from the occurrence of the above jump mechanism is which are the 2\u03bd sites of the\nsteady local c, \u03bd \u2032 pseudoparticle that are jumped by each site of the moving local c, \u03bd pseudoparticle. Fortunately, the\nrequirements mentioned in the property 3-IV provide the needed information for the precise definition of the 2\u03bd \u2032 \u2212 1\npermitted positions of the local c, \u03bd pseudoparticle inside the steady local c, \u03bd \u2032 pseudoparticle. We find that in order\nto reach these permitted positions each site of the local c, \u03bd pseudoparticle must perform two independent jumps of \u03bd\nsites in the charge sequence. Let us suppose that the local c, \u03bd pseudoparticle is moving from the left to the right-hand\nside. These jumps bring the local c, \u03bd pseudoparticle to and from respectively, a position where its charge-sequence\nlocation h\u0304j , as given by Eq. (46), coincides with that of the steady local c, \u03bd \u2032 pseudoparticle. In such an event each\nof the 2\u03bd legs of the caterpillar jumps a number \u03bd of sites and reaches a position where its 2\u03bd legs occupy 2\u03bd sites\nof the charge sequence located around the center of the steady local c, \u03bd \u2032 pseudoparticle. In order to move forward\nto the right-hand side from that position, each of the 2\u03bd legs of the caterpillar jump again a number of \u03bd sites of\nthe charge sequence. Thus the possible positions of a local c, \u03bd pseudoparticle when it passes from the left to the\nright-hand side of a steady local c, \u03bd \u2032 pseudoparticle are the following: First the local c, \u03bd pseudoparticle performs a\n2\u03bd-leg caterpillar step. The net result of such an elementary collective step is that the compact domain of 2\u03bd sites of\nthe local c, \u03bd pseudoparticle interchanges position with the site of index hj \u2032 , 1 of the local c, \u03bd \u2032 pseudoparticle. Thus\nthis first elementary collective step brings the local c, \u03bd pseudoparticle inside the domain of 2\u03bd \u2032 sites of the steady\nlocal c, \u03bd \u2032 pseudoparticle. In the reached rotated-electron site distribution configuration all the 2\u03bd sites of the local\nc, \u03bd pseudoparticle are located between the sites of index hj \u2032 , 1 and hj \u2032 , 2 of the steady local c, \u03bd \u2032 pseudoparticle. This\nprocedure is repeated \u03bd \u2032 \u2212 1 times until the 2\u03bd sites of the c, \u03bd pseudoparticle are located between the sites of index\nhj \u2032 , \u03bd \u2032 \u22121 and hj \u2032 , \u03bd \u2032 of the steady local c, \u03bd \u2032 pseudoparticle. In each of the corresponding 2\u03bd-leg caterpillar steps the\nlocal c, \u03bd pseudoparticle moves forward by a single lattice site of the charge sequence. However, in the \u03bd \u2032 th step each\nsite of the c, \u03bd pseudoparticle jumps \u03bd sites of the charge sequence. This jump brings it to a rotated-electron site\ndistribution configuration where the charge-sequence position h\u0304j of the local c, \u03bd pseudoparticle given in Eq. (46)\ncoincides with that of the steady local c, \u03bd \u2032 pseudoparticle. Let hj, x where x = 1, ..., 2\u03bd denote the indices of the 2\u03bd\nsites of the c, \u03bd pseudoparticle while it was located between the sites of index hj \u2032 , \u03bd \u2032 \u22121 and hj \u2032 , \u03bd \u2032 of the local c, \u03bd \u2032\npseudoparticle. In the next collective movement the local c, \u03bd pseudoparticle site of index hj, 2\u03bd jumps into the site\nwhich was associated with the local c, \u03bd \u2032 pseudoparticle site of index hj \u2032 , \u03bd \u2032 +\u03bd . Out of the remaining 2\u03bd \u2212 1 sites of the\nlocal c, \u03bd pseudoparticle, \u03bd of these sites of indices hj, x such that x = \u03bd, ..., 2\u03bd\u22121 jump into the local c, \u03bd \u2032 pseudoparticle\nsites of indices hj \u2032 , \u03bd \u2032 \u2212\u03bd+x where again x = \u03bd, ..., 2\u03bd \u2212 1. The remaining \u03bd \u2212 1 sites of the local c, \u03bd pseudoparticle of\n\n\f25\nindices hj, x such that x = 1, ..., \u03bd \u2212 1 jump into the sites which were occupied by the local c, \u03bd pseudoparticle sites of\nindices hj, x where x = \u03bd + 2, ..., 2\u03bd. As a result of these events the local c, \u03bd \u2032 pseudoparticle site of index hj \u2032 , \u03bd \u2032 jumps\n\u03bd \u2212 1 charge-sequence sites from the right to the left-hand side and thus moves by a block of \u03bd sites in such a direction.\nIn contrast, all the remaining c, \u03bd \u2032 pseudoparticle sites of indices hj \u2032 , x such that x = 1, ..., \u03bd \u2032 \u2212 1, \u03bd \u2032 + 1, ..., 2\u03bd \u2032 jump\n\u03bd \u2212 1 charge-sequence sites from the left to the right-hand side and move by a block of \u03bd sites in such a direction.\nThese collective jumps reach a configuration where the 2\u03bd sites of the c, \u03bd pseudoparticle are located between the sites\nof index hj \u2032 , \u03bd \u2032 and hj \u2032 , 1+\u03bd \u2032 of the c, \u03bd \u2032 pseudoparticle. In order to reach the next permitted position each of the 2\u03bd\nlocal c, \u03bd pseudoparticle sites jump again a number \u03bd of lattice sites of the charge sequence. This brings the local c, \u03bd\npseudoparticle to a distribution configuration where its 2\u03bd sites are located between the sites of index hj \u2032 , 1+\u03bd \u2032 and\nhj \u2032 , 2+\u03bd \u2032 of the steady local c, \u03bd \u2032 pseudoparticle. These two jumps are followed by \u03bd \u2032 \u2212 1 2\u03bd-leg caterpillar steps where\nthe c, \u03bd pseudoparticle moves again by a single lattice site of the charge sequence. The net result of each of these\nelementary collective steps is that the compact domain of 2\u03bd c, \u03bd pseudoparticle sites interchanges position with one\nof the sites of the c, \u03bd \u2032 pseudoparticle. Step number \u03bd \u2032 \u2212 2 of these \u03bd \u2032 \u2212 1 2\u03bd-leg caterpillar steps leads to a distribution\nconfiguration where the 2\u03bd sites of the c, \u03bd pseudoparticle are located between the sites of index hj \u2032 , 2\u03bd \u2032 \u22121 and hj \u2032 , 2\u03bd \u2032\nof the steady local c, \u03bd \u2032 pseudoparticle. Finally, the last step brings the local c, \u03bd pseudoparticle to a distribution\nconfiguration where it is located outside and on the right-hand side of the domain of 2\u03bd \u2032 sites of the steady local c, \u03bd \u2032\npseudoparticle. The same intermediate positions are reached when the c, \u03bd pseudoparticle passes the domain of 2\u03bd \u2032\nsites of the c, \u03bd \u2032 pseudoparticle from the right to the left-hand side.\nWe have just studied a situation where a local c, \u03bd pseudoparticle passes a steady local c, \u03bd \u2032 pseudoparticle belonging\nto a branch such that \u03bd \u2032 > \u03bd. For simplicity we assumed that in the initial rotated-electron site distribution configuration the domain of 2\u03bd charge-sequence sites located just on the right-hand side of the steady local c, \u03bd \u2032 pseudoparticle\nare occupied by Yang holons. However, our results can be generalized to more complicated situations. An example is\na situation where a local c, \u03bd pseudoparticle passes a steady local c, \u03bd \u2032 pseudoparticle which has as first neighbor in\nthe charge sequence a second steady local c, \u03bd \u2032\u2032 pseudoparticle. Another example is when a local c, \u03bd pseudoparticle\npasses a steady local c, \u03bd \u2032 pseudoparticle containing inside its 2\u03bd \u2032 -site domain a third steady local c, \u03bd \u2032\u2032 pseudoparticle\nbelonging to a branch such that \u03bd \u2032\u2032 \u2264 \u03bd \u2032 . These more general situations can be described by the use of the properties\n1-IV to 4-IV. One always finds that in order to move forward, the 2\u03bd sites of the local c, \u03bd pseudoparticle use 2(\u03bd \u2032 \u2212 \u03bd)\nsites out of the total number of 2\u03bd \u2032 sites of each steady local c, \u03bd \u2032 pseudoparticle belonging to branches such that\n\u03bd \u2032 > \u03bd. Moreover, when passing the central region of the 2\u03bd \u2032 -site domain of such a local c, \u03bd \u2032 pseudoparticle, the 2\u03bd\nlegs of the c, \u03bd caterpillar always perform the two \u03bd-site jumps described above.\nIn summary, the number of charge-sequence empty sites of a c, \u03bd pseudoparticle equals the number of sites occupied\nby Yang holons plus a number of sites given by 2(\u03bd \u2032 \u2212 \u03bd) for each c, \u03bd \u2032 pseudoparticle of the charge sequence belonging\nto branches such that \u03bd \u2032 > \u03bd. The number of permitted positions of the local c, \u03bd pseudoparticle inside each of the\nsite domains of such a c, \u03bd \u2032 pseudoparticle is 2\u03bd \u2032 \u2212 1. In these permitted positions the c, \u03bd pseudoparticle is located\nbetween the sites hj \u2032 ,x and hj \u2032 ,x+1 such that x = 1, ..., 2\u03bd \u2032 \u2212 1 of the local c, \u03bd \u2032 pseudoparticle. In order to reach\nor to leave a position between the sites of index hj \u2032 , \u03bd \u2032 and hj \u2032 , 1+\u03bd \u2032 of a steady local c, \u03bd \u2032 pseudoparticle belonging\nto a branch such that \u03bd \u2032 > \u03bd, each of the 2\u03bd legs of the moving caterpillar always performs a jump of \u03bd sites in\nthe charge sequence. Otherwise it moves throughout the charge sequence by 2\u03bd-leg caterpillar steps. In such steps\nthe 2\u03bd-site block of the local c, \u03bd pseudoparticle moves forward by a charge-sequence site. The net result of such an\nevent is that the 2\u03bd-site domain of the moving quantum object interchanges position with either a Yang holon or\nwith a site of a c, \u03bd \u2032 pseudoparticle belonging to a branch such that \u03bd \u2032 > \u03bd. The present definition of the permitted\npositions of a local c, \u03bd pseudoparticle when passing the remaining quantum objects which occupy a charge sequence\nprovides a consistent, complete, and unique description for the rotated-electron distribution configurations of doubly\noccupied sites and empty sites which describe the charge sequence. The results obtained for the charge sequences and\ncorresponding c, \u03bd pseudoparticles are also valid for the spin sequences and their s, \u03bd pseudoparticles.\nThe events studied above are illustrated in Figs. 5 and 6 for the case when a local c, 1 pseudoparticle passes a\nsteady local c, 1 pseudoparticle and a steady local c, 2 pseudoparticle respectively, from the left to the right-hand\nside. If instead we consider that the local c, 1 pseudoparticle is steady, Fig. 6 illustrates the possible positions of\na local c, 2 pseudoparticle when it passes from the right to the left-hand side a steady local c, 1 pseudoparticle. In\nthis case the position in the effective electronic lattice of the two sites of the c, 1 pseudoparticle remains unchanged\nand the different relative positions of the two quantum objects are reached by movements of the c, 2 pseudoparticle.\nImportantly, we emphasize that in this case the c, 2 pseudoparticle does not occupy the sites occupied by the c, 1\npseudoparticle. Again this is consistent with property 3-IV.\nThe charge sequence (and the spin sequence) is obtained by omission of the rotated-electron singly occupied sites\n(and rotated-electron doubly occupied/empty sites). Such a procedure follows from the independent conservation\nof the charge and spin sequence. We note that each of the c, \u03bd pseudoparticle (and s, \u03bd pseudoparticle) branch\noccupancy configurations are also independently conserved. Thus it follows our above analysis that the construction\nof the effective c, \u03bd pseudoparticle lattice mentioned in property 8-III also involves omission of the sites of the effective\n\n\f26\nelectronic lattice which are jumped by the movements of a c, \u03bd pseudoparticle, since these sites are not seen by such\na moving quantum object. The omitted sites correspond to the 2\u03bd \u2032 -site domains of local c, \u03bd \u2032 pseudoparticles of\nbranches such that \u03bd \u2032 < \u03bd and to 2\u03bd-site domains belonging to the 2\u03bd \u2032 sites of each c, \u03bd \u2032 pseudoparticle such that\n\u03bd \u2032 > \u03bd. Moreover, for such an effective c, \u03bd pseudoparticle lattice the 2\u03bd-site domain\nof the c, \u03bd pseudoparticles is\nP\nseen as a point-like occupied site. Thus such an effective lattice has Nc,\u2217 \u03bd = Lc + \u03bd \u2032 >\u03bd 2(\u03bd \u2032 \u2212 \u03bd) Nc, \u03bd \u2032 + Nc, \u03bd sites, a\nP\nnumber Nc,h \u03bd = Lc + 2 \u03bd \u2032 >\u03bd (\u03bd \u2032 \u2212 \u03bd) Nc, \u03bd \u2032 of which are empty of c, \u03bd pseudoparticles, as we confirm below. A similar\nanalysis holds for the s, \u03bd pseudoparticles.\nC.\n\nCOMPLETE SET OF CHARGE, SPIN, AND c PSEUDOPARTICLE SEQUENCE LOCAL STATES\n\nWe have just found the rotated-electron distribution configurations of the 2\u03bd sites which describe a local \u03b1, \u03bd\nh\npseudoparticle. Moreover, we also defined the N\u03b1,\n\u03bd charge-sequence empty sites of such a local \u03b1, \u03bd pseudoparticle. Although our results can be generalized to the case of the local spin sequences and corresponding local s, \u03bd\npseudoparticles, often our analysis focused explicitly on the case of the local charge sequences and associated local\nc, \u03bd pseudoparticles. An important result which follows from our findings is that indeed the positions of the Nc,h \u03bd\ncharge-sequence empty sites of each local c, \u03bd pseudoparticle branch are fully determined by the location of the c\npseudoparticles and c, \u03bd pseudoparticles alone. Our results thus confirm that for fixed values of the numbers Nc, \u03bd\nand Nc,\u2217 \u03bd the number of occupancy configurations of the local c, \u03bd pseudoparticles is given by Eq. (49) for \u03b1 = c.\nIt follows that we can classify the local c, \u03bd pseudoparticle occupancy configurations for \u03bd = 1, 2, ... branches with\nfinite occupancy in a given state by providing the indices hj given in Eqs. (45). These indices correspond to the\nNc, \u03bd pseudoparticle locations provided in Eq. (50). Our results also confirm that the number of local pseudoparticle\noccupancy configurations of a CPHS ensemble subspace is indeed given by Eq. (52). Finally, since our results can be\ngeneralized to spin sequences as well, they also validate the use of the representation associated with the local state\ndefined in Eqs. (53)-(55). Such a local state represents each of the different local pseudoparticle occupancy configurations whose number for a specific CPHS ensemble subspace is given in Eq. (52). Our results also confirm that the\nset of these local states whose number is given in Eq. (52) constitutes a complete set of states in the corresponding\nCPHS ensemble subspace.\nThus in the case of CPHS ensemble subspaces with no \u22121/2 Yang holons and no \u22121/2 HL spinons the local states\ndefined in Eqs. (53)-(55) constitute a complete set of states. Our main goal here is the generalization of these local\nstates to CPHS ensemble subspaces with finite occupancies of both \u00b11/2 Yang holons and \u00b11/2 HL spinons. We start\nby expressing the complete set of local states defined in Eqs. (53)-(55) in terms of the following more basic states,\n|(j1 , j2 , ..., jNc ); {(\u2022hj, 1 , ..., \u2022hj, \u03bd , \u25e6hj, 1+\u03bd , ..., \u25e6hj, 2\u03bd )}; {(\u2193lj, 1 , ..., \u2193lj, \u03bd , \u2191lj, 1+\u03bd , ..., \u2191lj, 2\u03bd )}i ,\n\n(75)\n\nwhere the charge sequence refers to the following sets of rotated-electron distribution configurations of doubly-occupied\nand empty sites,\n{(\u2022hj, 1 , ..., \u2022hj, \u03bd , \u25e6hj, 1+\u03bd , ..., \u25e6hj, 2\u03bd )} = (\u2022h1, 1 , \u25e6h1, 2 ), (\u2022h2, 1 , \u25e6h2, 2 ), ..., (\u2022hNc, 1 , 1 , \u25e6hNc, 1 , 2 );\n(\u2022h1, 1 , \u2022h1, 2 , \u25e6h1, 3 , \u25e6h1, 4 ), (\u2022h2, 1 , \u2022h2, 2 , \u25e6h2, 3 , \u25e6h2, 4 ), ..., (\u2022hNc, 2 , 1 , \u2022hNc, 2 , 2 , \u25e6hNc, 2 , 3 , \u25e6hNc, 2 , 4 ); ...;\n(\u2022h1, 1 , ..., \u2022h1, \u03bd , \u25e6h1, 1+\u03bd , ..., \u25e6h1, 2\u03bd ), (\u2022h2, 1 , ..., \u2022h2, \u03bd , \u25e62j, 1+\u03bd , ..., \u25e6h2, 2\u03bd ), ...,\n(\u2022hNc, \u03bd , 1 , ..., \u2022hNc, \u03bd , \u03bd , \u25e6hNc, \u03bd , \u03bd+1 , ..., \u25e6hNc, \u03bd , 2\u03bd ); ...\n\n(76)\n\nand the same follows for the spin sequence with the index h replaced by the index l, rotated-electron doubly occupied\nsites \u2022 replaced by spin-down rotated-electron singly occupied sites \u2193, and sites free of rotated electrons \u25e6 replaced by\nspin-up rotated-electron singly occupied sites \u2191. The states defined in Eqs. (75)-(76) provide the location of the 2\u03bd\nsites associated with each of the \u03b1, \u03bd pseudoparticles whose branches have finite occupancy in the corresponding charge\nand spin sequence. However, we note that these states include only rotated-electron site distribution configurations\nof the simple type given in Eqs. (56) and (57). The general charge and spin sequences can be obtained from these\nstates by application of suitable operators, as we discussed above. These are thus the most basic and simple states.\nOur first task is expressing the states defined in Eqs. (53)-(55) in terms of these simple states.\nEach local c, \u03bd and s, \u03bd pseudoparticle is described by the superposition of 2\u03bd rotated-electron site distribution\nconfigurations given in Eqs. (58) and (59) respectively. The type of configuration superposition given in these\nequations is common to the description of all local \u03b1, \u03bd pseudoparticles of a charge or spin sequence. Thus the\nproper description of the the charge and spin sequence of each of the states defined in Eqs. (53)-(55) involves the\n\n\f27\nP\nP\u221e\n\u03bd N\u03b1, \u03bd\nsuperposition of 2 \u03b1=c,s \u03bd=1\nsuch a rotated-electron site distribution configurations. It follows that these\nnormalized local states can be expressed as follows,\n\n2\n=\n\nh\n\n[\n\nP\n\n\u03b1=c,s\n\nP\u221e\n\n\u03bd=1\n\n\u2032\n\u221e NY\nc,\u03bd \u2032 2\u03bd\nY\nY\n\n\u03bd \u2032 =1 j \u2032 =1 x=1\n\ne\n\n\u03bd N\u03b1, \u03bd ]/2\n\ni\u03c0hj\u2032 , x D\u0302j\u2032 , x\n\n|(j1 , j2 , ..., jNc ); {(h1 , h2 , ..., hNc, \u03bd )}; {(l1 , l2 , ..., lNs, \u03bd )}i\n\u2032\u2032\n\u221e NY\n\u03b1,\u03bd \u2032\u2032 \u03bd\nih Y Y\nY\n\ni\n(1 \u2212 T\u0302\u03b1, \u03bd \u2032\u2032 , j \u2032\u2032 , g\u2032\u2032 )\n\n\u03b1=c,s \u03bd \u2032\u2032 =1 j \u2032\u2032 =1 g\u2032\u2032 =1\n\n\u00d7 |(j1 , j2 , ..., jNc ); {(\u2022hj, 1 , ..., \u2022hj, \u03bd , \u25e6hj, 1+\u03bd , ..., \u25e6hj, 2\u03bd )}; {(\u2193lj, 1 , ..., \u2193lj, \u03bd , \u2191lj, 1+\u03bd , ..., \u2191lj, 2\u03bd )}i ,\n\n(77)\n\nwhere the operator D\u0302j \u2032 , x measures the number of rotated-electron doubly occupied sites in the charge-sequence site\nof index hj \u2032 , x (whose value is given by 1 or 0) and the transformation laws for application of the operator T\u0302\u03b1, \u03bd \u2032\u2032 , j \u2032\u2032 , g\u2032\u2032\nwere given above and are illustrated in Eqs. (60) and (61).\nThe local states given in both Eqs. (53)-(55) and in Eq. (77) provide a complete basis of states for CPHS ensemble\nsubspaces spanned by lowest-weight states of both the SU (2) \u03b7-spin and spin algebras. Let us now consider the general\ncase of states associated with CPHS ensemble subspaces spanned by states with both finite occupancies of \u00b11/2 Yang\nholons and \u00b11/2 HL spinons. The description of the local charge and spin sequences with finite occupancies of \u00b11/2\nYang holons and \u00b11/2 HL spinons respectively, is quite similar to the ones we studied above. For simplicity let us\nconsider first the case of the charge sequences. According to property 1-III the \u22121/2 Yang holons and +1/2 Yang\nholons correspond to single rotated-electron doubly occupied lattice sites and single rotated-electron empty lattice\nsites of such a charge sequence respectively. In the case of a lowest weight state (and highest weight state) of the\n\u03b7-spin algebra all Yang holons have the same \u03b7-spin projection \u03c3c = +1/2 (and \u03c3c = \u22121/2) and correspond to rotatedelectron empty sites (and rotated-electron doubly occupied sites). The application of the off-diagonal generators of\nthe SU (2) \u03b7-spin algebra given in Eq. (7) leads to flips of the Yang holons \u03b7-spins [11]. Following property 5-III, in\norder to achieve the Yang holon occupancy configurations required by the SU (2) \u03b7-spin algebra, we find that each\nlocal charge sequence is described by a superposition\n\u0012\n\nLc\nLc, \u22121/2\n\n\u0013\n\n=\n\nLc !\n,\nLc, \u22121/2 ! Lc, +1/2 !\n\n(78)\n\nof Yang holon occupancy \u0001configurations. Here Lc = 2Sc stands for the total number of Yang holons in the charge\nc\nsequence. All the Lc,L\u22121/2\nstates associated with these configurations have the same set of Lc lattice sites occupied\nby Yang holons and the same numbers of \u22121/2 Yang holons and +1/2 Yang holons. However, these states differ\nin the distributions of the \u22121/2 Yang holons and +1/2 Yang holons over the Lc lattice\nQ sites. The same analysis\nholds for spin sequences with finite occupancies of \u00b11/2 HL spinons. Thus there are \u03b1=c,s (L\u03b1 + 1) states with\nprecisely the same occupancy configurations of local c pseudoparticles and local \u03b1, \u03bd pseudoparticles. Each of these\noccupancy\nconfigurations is described by a state of form given in Eq. (77). On the other hand, we denote each of the\nQ\n\u03b1=c,s (L\u03b1 + 1) general states by,\n|(Lc,\u22121/2 , Ls,\u22121/2 ); (j1 , j2 , ..., jNc ); {(h1 , h2 , ..., hNc, \u03bd )}; {(l1 , l2 , ..., lNs, \u03bd )}i ,\n\n(79)\n\nwhere Lc,\u22121/2 and Ls,\u22121/2 are the corresponding numbers of \u22121/2 Yang holons and \u22121/2 HL spinons respectively.\nWe note that Eq. (42) remains valid for the general local states (79). Thus the values of the numbers Lc and Ls\nare determined by the values of the numbers of c pseudoparticles and of \u03b1, \u03bd pseudoparticles. The values of the\nnumbers Lc,\u22121/2 and Ls,\u22121/2 were added to the local states (79) because they are needed for the specification of the\ncorresponding CPHS ensemble subspace. In contrast, the values of the numbers Lc,+1/2 and Ls,+1/2 are dependent\nand given by Lc,+1/2 = Lc \u2212 Lc,\u22121/2 and Ls,+1/2 = Ls \u2212 Lc,\u22121/2 and are not explicitly provided in the expression of\nthe local states (79).

(7) and (8). Importantly,\napplication of these operators onto the local states given in Eq. (77) leaves the rotated-electron site distribution\nconfigurations of the \u03b1, \u03bd pseudoparticles invariant and generates \u03b7-spin and spin flips in the +1/2 Yang holons and\n+1/2 HL spinons respectively, as requested by property 5-III.\nThe set of all local states of general form given in Eq. (80) provides a complete basis of states in any CPHS ensemble\nsubspace of the Hilbert space. However, these states do not ensure the periodic boundary conditions of the original\nelectronic problem. Such conditions are ensured by the construction of the energy eigenstates as Fourier-transform\nsuperpositions of local states of general form given in Eq. (80), as discussed in the ensuing section.\n\nV. SEPARATION OF THE \u03b1, \u03bd PSEUDOPARTICLE TRANSLATIONAL - INTERNAL DEGREES OF\nFREEDOM: EFFECTIVE \u03b1, \u03bd PSEUDOPARTICLE LATTICES AND THE ENERGY EIGENSTATES\n\nIn this section we finally reach a precise definition for the concept of effective \u03b1, \u03bd pseudoparticle lattices. The precise\ndefinition of such a concept is a necessary condition for the construction of the energy eigenstates as Fourier-transform\nsuperpositions of the local states introduced in the previous section. The concept of effective \u03b1, \u03bd pseudoparticle lattice\nis related to the separation of the translational and internal degrees of freedom of these quantum objects, as we explain\nbelow. As mentioned in property 8-III, in addition to the effective c pseudoparticle lattice, there is an effective \u03b1, \u03bd\npseudoparticle lattice for each \u03b1 = c, s and \u03bd = 1, 2, ... pseudoparticle branch. The spatial coordinate associated with\nthese lattices is the conjugate of the pseudoparticle band-momentum qj , which is a good quantum number of the\nmany-electron problem. Thus the Fourier transforms which relate the local pseudoparticles introduced in this paper\nto the band-momentum pseudoparticles obtained from analysis of the Bethe-ansatz solution in Ref. [11] involve the\nspatial coordinate of the effective pseudoparticle lattices.\nBesides the introduction of the effective pseudoparticle lattices, in this section we also provide explicit expressions\nfor the energy eigenstates in terms of Slater determinants which involve Fourier-transform superpositions of the local\nstates introduced in the previous section. This clarifies the relation of these energy eigenstates to the rotated-electron\nsite distribution configurations. Indeed, analysis of the new found expressions of the energy eigenstates provides\nuseful information on the processes involved in the diagonalization of the non-perturbative quantum problem after\nthe electron - rotated-electron Hilbert-space unitary rotation is performed. Such a non-perturbative diagonalization\nleads to nothing but the energy eigenstates also reached by the Bethe-ansatz solution.\nA.\n\nTRANSLATIONAL - INTERNAL DEGREES OF FREEDOM SEPARATION AND THE EFFECTIVE\n\u03b1, \u03bd PSEUDOPARTICLE LATTICES\n\nSince the present problem is treated in a similar manner for the c, \u03bd and s, \u03bd pseudoparticles, for simplicity let us\nagain concentrate namely on the case of the c, \u03bd pseudoparticles. The separation of the \u03b1, \u03bd pseudoparticle translational\nand internal degrees of freedom can be defined in terms of the following general properties which are obtained from\nthe above properties 1-III to 8-III and 1-IV to 3-IV, and other features of the 1D Hubbard model:\n1-V One can separate the 2\u03bd-site internal structure of a local c, \u03bd pseudoparticle from the problem of the description\nof the movements of these quantum objects in the effective electronic lattice. Such separation leads to the concept of\neffective pseudoparticle lattice, whose spatial coordinates are associated with the pseudoparticle translational degrees\nof freedom only. According to the properties 1-IV to 4-IV, in addition to the 2\u03bd-leg caterpillar steps associated with\nthe motion of a c, \u03bd pseudoparticle, such a quantum object jumps each of the 2\u03bd-site domains of the remaining local\npseudoparticles of the same branch. Thus in the description of the motion of a local c, \u03bd pseudoparticle, the 2\u03bd-site\n\n\f29\ndomains of these objects play the role of the occupied sites of an effective c, \u03bd pseudoparticle lattice. From the point of\nview of the motion of these objects in such an effective c, \u03bd pseudoparticle lattice these 2\u03bd-site domains are point-like\nsites without internal structure. Roughly speaking, these point-like pseudoparticle occupied sites correspond to the\ncenter of mass of the 2\u03bd-site block associated with each local c, \u03bd pseudoparticle. This description corresponds to\na separation of the pseudoparticle translational and internal degrees of freedom. The latter degrees of freedom are\ndescribed by the 2\u03bd-site rotated-electron distribution configurations studied in the previous section. Such internal\nstructure plays a key role both in the fulfilment of the c, \u03bd pseudoparticle transformations under application of the\noff-diagonal generators of the SU (2) \u03b7-spin algebra. In addition, such an internal structure is a necessary condition\nfor the fulfilment of the periodic boundary conditions of the original electronic problem. On the other hand, the\nc, \u03bd pseudoparticle translational degrees of freedom are closely related to the spatial coordinates of the effective\npseudoparticle lattice. These spatial coordinates play the role of conjugate variable relative to the band momentum\nqj . Such a band momentum obeys Eq. (38) to ensure periodic boundary conditions for the original electronic problem.\nAn important point is that the pseudoparticle spatial coordinate occupancy configuration of each c, \u03bd pseudoparticle\nbranch with finite occupancy in a given energy eigenstate is independently conserved. As the charge (and spin)\nsequence corresponds to the rotated-electron doubly occupied and empty sites (and rotated-electron singly occupied\nsites) only, one can also introduce an independent effective c, \u03bd pseudoparticle lattice for each of these occupied\npseudoparticle branches, whose coordinates correspond to some of the sites of the local charge sequence only.\n2-V Within the above separation of the pseudoparticle translational and internal degrees of freedom, the moving c, \u03bd\npseudoparticle sees the 2\u03bd-site domains of each of the local pseudoparticles belonging to the same branch as point-like\noccupied pseudoparticle sites. On the other hand, according to the property 3-IV a moving c, \u03bd pseudoparticle jumps\nthe 2\u03bd \u2032 -site domains representative of each local c, \u03bd \u2032 pseudoparticles belonging to branches such that \u03bd \u2032 \u2264 \u03bd. This\nproperty can be understood as follows: Since in its movements the c, \u03bd pseudoparticle sees the 2\u03bd-site domains of\nthe remaining c, \u03bd pseudoparticles of the same branch as point-like unreachable occupied pseudoparticle sites, such\na 2\u03bd-site domain width is the smallest width seen by the c, \u03bd pseudoparticle. Thus such a width plays the role of a\nsite domain width uncertainty. As a result, pseudoparticle site domains of width smaller than the 2\u03bd-site domain are\nnot seen by the c, \u03bd pseudoparticle. This is consistent with the exact property that the moving c, \u03bd pseudoparticle\ndoes not see (i.e. jumps) smaller 2\u03bd \u2032 -site c, \u03bd \u2032 pseudoparticle domains corresponding to branches such that \u03bd \u2032 < \u03bd.\nOn the other hand, again according to property 3-IV, the 2\u03bd-leg caterpillar step movements of the c, \u03bd pseudoparticle\nuses 2(\u03bd \u2032 \u2212 \u03bd) sites only, out of the 2\u03bd \u2032 -site domain of each local c, \u03bd \u2032 pseudoparticle belonging to branches such\nthat \u03bd \u2032 > \u03bd. Thus, again consistently with the above site domain width uncertainty, in their motion throughout the\neffective electronic lattice, a local c, \u03bd pseudoparticle does not see a number 2\u03bd of sites out of the 2\u03bd \u2032 sites of such a\n\u03bd \u2032 > \u03bd local c, \u03bd \u2032 pseudoparticle.\n3-V Let us introduce the concepts of empty sites and lattice constant of the effective c, \u03bd pseudoparticle lattice\nwhich follow from the above analysis. For the moving c, \u03bd pseudoparticle all the Nc,h \u03bd charge-sequence empty sites\nP\u221e\ncorresponding to a number Lc of \u00b11/2 Yang holons and a number 2 \u03bd \u2032 =\u03bd+1 (\u03bd \u2032 \u2212 \u03bd) Nc, \u03bd \u2032 of sites belonging to the\n2\u03bd \u2032 -site domains of local c, \u03bd \u2032 pseudoparticles of the charge sequence such that \u03bd \u2032 > \u03bd are seen as equivalent and\nindiscernible point-like empty sites of a effective c, \u03bd pseudoparticle lattice. Moreover, according to the property 1-V\nsuch a quantum object also sees the Nc, \u03bd 2\u03bd-site domains of pseudoparticles belonging to the c, \u03bd pseudoparticle\nbranch as equivalent and indiscernible point-like occupied sites. Thus while running through all its possible positions\nin the effective electronic lattice the moving c, \u03bd pseudoparticle sees all the Nc,\u2217 \u03bd = Nc, \u03bd + Nc,h \u03bd sites of the effective\nc, \u03bd pseudoparticle lattice as equivalent and indiscernible point-like sites. Therefore, these sites are equally spaced for\nthe effective c, \u03bd pseudoparticle lattice. The value of the corresponding\nlattice constant is uniquely defined as follows:\nP\u03bd\nIn its movements a c, \u03bd pseudoparticle does not see (i) theP2 \u03bd \u2032 =1 \u03bd \u2032 Nc, \u03bd \u2032 sites occupied by c, \u03bd \u2032 pseudoparticles\n\u2032\nbelonging to branches such that \u03bd \u2032 \u2264 \u03bd; (ii) a number 2\u03bd \u221e\n\u03bd \u2032 =\u03bd+1 Nc, \u03bd \u2032 of sites belonging to the 2\u03bd -site domains\n\u2032\n\u2032\nof c, \u03bd pseudoparticles belonging to branches such that \u03bd > \u03bd; and (iii) the Nc sites singly occupied by rotated\nelectrons. Thus the the c, \u03bd pseudoparticle jumps all the above sites of the effective electronic lattice and sees the\n2\u03bd-site pseudoparticle domains of the c, \u03bd pseudoparticle branch as point-like occupied sites. On the other hand, in\norder to pass all the Nc,\u2217 \u03bd = Nc, \u03bd + Nc,h \u03bd sites of the effective c, \u03bd pseudoparticle lattice and return to its original\nposition, the c, \u03bd pseudoparticle should run through a distance which equals the length L of the real-space and effective\nelectronic lattice. Therefore, a necessary condition to ensure the periodic boundary conditions of the original electronic\nproblem is that the length of the effective c, \u03bd pseudoparticle lattice must equal the length L of the effective electronic\nlattice. This determines uniquely the value of the lattice constant of the effective c, \u03bd pseudoparticle lattice which\nreads ac, \u03bd = L/Nc,\u2217 \u03bd . That the length of the effective c, \u03bd pseudoparticle lattice is L is consistent with the spacing\nqj+1 \u2212 qj = 2\u03c0/L given in Eq. (19) for the corresponding pseudoparticle discrete band-momentum values provided by\nthe exact Bethe-ansatz solution [11]. Such a discrete band momentum qj is the conjugate of the coordinate xj = ac, \u03bd j\n\n\f30\nof the effective c, \u03bd pseudoparticle lattice where j = 1, 2, ..., Nc,\u2217 \u03bd .\n4-V A similar analysis is valid for the local s, \u03bd pseudoparticles, provided that the above mentioned Nc sites singly\noccupied by rotated electrons are replaced by the [Na \u2212 Nc ] sites doubly occupied by rotated electrons and free of\n\u2217\nrotated electrons. The lattice constant of the effective s, \u03bd pseudoparticle lattice is given by as, \u03bd = L/Ns,\n\u03bd . On the\nother hand, the effective c pseudoparticle lattice has Na lattice sites and its lattice constant a is the same as for the\neffective electronic lattice. The positions of the Nc c pseudoparticles and Nch = [Na \u2212 Nc ] c pseudoparticle holes in this\neffective lattice equal the corresponding positions of the rotated-electron singly occupied sites and rotated-electron\ndoubly occupied/empty sites, as already discussed in previous sections.\n5-V The set of pseudoparticle occupancy configurations of the effective c pseudoparticle, c, \u03bd pseudoparticle, and\ns, \u03bd pseudoparticle lattices belonging to branches \u03bd = 1, 2, ... with finite occupancy in a given local state of form (80)\ntogether with the numbers Lc, \u22121/2 and Ls, \u22121/2 of such a state contain the same information as the corresponding\ndescription of the same local state in terms of the rotated-electron site distribution configurations.\n\u2217\nSince the value of the number N\u03b1,\n\u03bd given in Eqs. (17) and (18) is distinct for different CPHS ensemble subspaces,\nit follows from the expression of the effective \u03b1, \u03bd pseudoparticle lattice constants,\n\na\u03b1, \u03bd = a\n\nL\nNa\n= \u2217 ;\n\u2217\nN\u03b1, \u03bd\nN\u03b1, \u03bd\n\n\u03b1 = c, s ;\n\n\u03bd = 1, 2, 3, ... ,\n\n(81)\n\nthat the value of such constants changes accordingly.\nLet us introduce the following notation for the spatial coordinates of the effective c pseudoparticle lattice,\nxj = a j ,\n\nj = 1, 2, 3, ..., Na ,\n\n(82)\n\nwhere the index j was called jl and jh in Eq. (44) for the c pseudoparticle occupied sites (l = 1, 2, 3, ..., Nc) and\nempty sites (h = 1, 2, 3, ..., [Na \u2212 Nc ]) respectively. We recall that the number of these occupied and empty sites of\nthe effective c pseudoparticle lattice equals the number of rotated-electron singly occupied sites and rotated-electron\ndoubly occupied/empty sites respectively. Moreover, let us introduce the following notation for the spatial coordinates\nof the effective c, \u03bd pseudoparticle and s, \u03bd pseudoparticle lattices,\nxj = ac, \u03bd j ,\n\nj = 1, 2, 3, ..., Nc,\u2217 \u03bd ,\n\n(83)\n\nxj = as, \u03bd j ,\n\n\u2217\nj = 1, 2, 3, ..., Ns,\n\u03bd,\n\n(84)\n\nand\n\nrespectively.\nThe band-momentum limiting values given in Eq. (20) for the \u03b1, \u03bd pseudoparticle bands can be expressed in terms\nof the corresponding lattice constants a\u03b1, \u03bd as follows,\nq\u03b1, \u03bd =\n\n\u03c0\na\u03b1, \u03bd\n\n[1 \u2212 1/Na ] \u2248\n\n\u03c0\na\u03b1, \u03bd\n\n.\n\n(85)\n\nAlso the c pseudoparticle limiting band-momentum value (23) can be written as,\nqc =\n\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\n[1 \u2212 1/Na ] \u2248 .\na\na\n\n(86)\n\nThus the domain of available pseudoparticle band-momentum values corresponds to an effective first-Brillouin zone\nassociated with an underlying effective pseudoparticle lattice. The fact that the spatial coordinate introduced in Eqs.\n(82), (83), and (84) is the conjugate of the pseudoparticle band momentum given in Eq. (16) is used in Refs. [53, 54]\nin Fourier analysis involving pseudoparticle creation and annihilation operators.\n\n\f31\nThe ground-state plays an important role in the study of finite-energy few-electron spectral functions [53, 54].\nThus let us use the ground-state Eqs. (29) and (30) in order to find the corresponding values for the effective \u03b1, \u03bd\npseudoparticle lattice constants in the case of electronic densities n and spin densities m such that 0 < n < 1/a and\n0 < m < n respectively. We find that in the case of a ground state corresponding to an electronic density and a spin\ndensity whose values are within these domains these constants read,\na0c, \u03bd =\n\na\n;\n\u03b4\n\na0s, 1 =\n\na\n;\nn\u2191\n\na0s, \u03bd =\n\na\n,\nm\n\n(87)\n\nwhere \u03b4 = [1/a \u2212 n] is the doping concentration away from half filling.\n\u2217\nMoreover, the ground-state number N\u03b1,\n\u03bd given in Eq. (29) and the ground-state limiting band-momentum values\n(30) can be written in terms of the effective pseudoparticle lattice constants as follows,\n\u2217\nN\u03b1,\n\u03bd =\n\nL\n,\na0\u03b1, \u03bd\n\n(88)\n\nand\n0\nq\u03b1,\n\u03bd =\n\n\u03c0\na0\u03b1, \u03bd\n\n.\n\n(89)\n\nrespectively.\nWe note that when the effective pseudoparticle lattice constants given in Eq. (87) diverge, as is the case for a0c, \u03bd\n\u2217\nas \u03b4 = [1/a \u2212 n] \u2192 0 and for a0s, \u03bd as m = [n\u2191 \u2212 n\u2193 ] \u2192 0 when \u03bd > 1, the corresponding number N\u03b1,\n\u03bd is zero. This\njust means that in these limits these bands and corresponding effective lattices do not exist for states belonging to\nthe ground-state CPHS ensemble subspace.\nFinally, let us relate the new introduced effective pseudoparticle lattices to previous results on the 1D Hubbard\nmodel in the limit U/t \u2192 \u221e. Indeed the effective c and s, 1 pseudoparticle lattices introduced here are related to\nknown properties of the model in that limit. For instance, it is well known that in such a limit and at zero spin density\nthe charge and spin degrees of freedom of the 1D Hubbard model can be described by two independent systems of\nN spin-less fermions and N/2 spin-down spins [2, 3, 4, 5, 11, 12]. The spin-less fermions can be associated with\nan effective lattice with j = 1, 2, 3, ..., Na sites, whereas the N/2 spin-down spins correspond to a squeezed effective\nlattice with j = 1, 2, 3, ..., N/2 sites. The spin-less fermion and spin occupancy configurations of these effective lattices\ndescribe electron occupancy configurations of the associated real-space lattice. In the limit U/t \u2192 \u221e such spin-less\nfermion and spin effective lattices are directly related to the effective c pseudoparticle and s, 1 pseudoparticle lattices\nrespectively, introduced above. On the other hand, within our pseudoparticle description of the quantum problem\nthese effective pseudoparticle lattices are well defined for all finite values of U/t. In that case the pseudoparticle\noccupancy configurations of these effective lattices describe rotated-electron site distribution configurations. In the\nlimit U/t \u2192 \u221e the energy eigenstates with finite occupancies in the effective c, \u03bd pseudoparticle lattices have finite\nvalues of electron double occupation. Thus according to the energy spectrum given in Eq. (31) these states have\nin such a limit an infinite excitation energy relative to the ground state and do not contribute to the finite-energy\nphysics. This explains why these states are unimportant for the U/t \u2192 \u221e physics and are in general not considered\nin that limit [2, 3, 4, 5]. At zero spin density the effective s, \u03bd pseudoparticle lattices such that \u03bd > 1 do not exist for\n\u2217\nthe ground state because Ns,\n\u03bd = 0 for such a state. However, at zero spin density excitations with finite occupancy\nof s, \u03bd pseudoparticles belonging to branches such that \u03bd > 1 have a gapless energy spectrum. In the limit U/t \u2192 \u221e\nthe spin excitations involving both occupancy configurations of s, 1 pseudoparticles and s, \u03bd pseudoparticles belonging\nto branches such that \u03bd > 1 are often described by the isotropic Heisenberg chain which describes these excitations\n[2, 3, 4, 5].\nB.\n\nCONSTRUCTION OF THE ENERGY EIGENSTATES\n\nOur last goal is the construction of the energy eigenstates in terms of the local charge, spin, and c pseudoparticle\nsequences studied in previous sections. The energy eigenstates are described in terms of band-momentum pseudoparticle, Yang holon, and HL spinon occupancy configurations in Ref. [11] by direct use of the Bethe-ansatz solution and\nSO(4) symmetry of the model. In the previous section we expressed the local states given in both Eqs. (53)-(55) and\nEq. (77) in terms of rotated-electron site distribution configurations and showed that they provide a complete basis of\n\n\f32\nstates. In order to relate these local states to the energy eigenstates we should first express the former states in terms\nof local c and \u03b1, \u03bd pseudoparticle occupancy configurations in the corresponding effective pseudoparticle lattices. We\nthen Fourier transform the obtained states into band-momentum space qj with respect to the spatial coordinates of\nthe effective c and \u03b1, \u03bd pseudoparticle lattices.\nAs in the case of Eq. (44) for the case of the effective c pseudoparticle lattice, we denote by jl and jh where\nh\nl = 1, 2, ..., N\u03b1, \u03bd and h = 1, 2, ..., N\u03b1,\n\u03bd respectively, the occupied and empty sites respectively, of the effective \u03b1, \u03bd\npseudoparticle lattices. The spatial coordinate of these occupied and empty pseudoparticle sites is given by,\nxjl = a\u03b1, \u03bd jl ,\nxjh = a\u03b1, \u03bd jh ,\n\nl = 1, 2, ..., N\u03b1, \u03bd ;\nh\nh = 1, 2, ..., N\u03b1,\n\u03bd;\n\n\u03b1 = c, s ;\n\u03b1 = c, s ,\n\n(90)\n\nwhere jl is the index which defines the position of the occupied pseudoparticle sites and jh the location of the empty\npseudoparticle sites. We note that the empty sites of the effective pseudoparticle lattices correspond to the sites left\nover by the occupied sites and vice versa. Thus we can uniquely specify a given effective pseudoparticle lattice site\ndistribution configuration by providing the location of the occupied sites (or empty sites) only. Here we choose the\nrepresentation in terms of the locations in the effective c and \u03b1, \u03bd pseudoparticle lattices of the occupied sites xjl of\nEqs. (44) and (90). In such a representation the states given in Eq. (80) are denoted as,\n|(Lc,\u22121/2 , Ls,\u22121/2 ); (xj1 , xj2 , ..., xjNc ); {(xj1 , xj2 , ..., xjNc, \u03bd )}; {(xj1 , xj2 , ..., xjNs, \u03bd )}i .\n\n(91)\n\nHere (xj1 , xj2 , ..., xjNc ) is the set of spatial coordinates associated with the set of indices (j1 , j2 , ..., jNc ) given in Eq.\n(41). These spatial coordinates correspond to the set of sites occupied by c pseudoparticles in the corresponding\neffective lattice. Moreover,\n{(xj1 , xj2 , ..., xjN\u03b1, \u03bd )} = (xj1 , xj2 , ..., xjN\u03b1, 1 ); (xj1 , xj2 , ..., xjN\u03b1, 2 ); (xj1 , xj2 , ..., xjN\u03b1, 3 ); ... ,\n\u03b1 = c, s ,\n\n(92)\n\ngives the local pseudoparticle coordinates of each of the effective \u03b1, \u03bd pseudoparticle lattices with finite occupancy in\nthe associated effective electronic lattice.\nWe emphasize that from analysis of the specific rotated-electron site distribution configurations relative to a given\nstate of form (77) one can construct by use of the above properties 1-V to 3-V the c pseudoparticle, c, \u03bd pseudoparticle,\nand s, \u03bd pseudoparticle occupancy configurations in the effective c, c, \u03bd, and s, \u03bd pseudoparticle lattices respectively, of\nthe corresponding state of form (91). This relation was already mentioned in the above property 5-V and the inverse\nstatement is obviously also true. Thus Eqs. (77) and (91) refer to two different representations of the same local\nstates. These local states constitute a complete set of states. However, the form of these local states does not ensure\nthe periodic boundary conditions of the original electronic problem.\nThe representation of the local states in terms of the effective pseudoparticle lattice occupancy configurations given\nin Eq. (91) is the most suitable starting point for construction of the energy and momentum eigenstates. Such a\nconstruction is fulfilled by Fourier transforming the local states given in Eq. (91) into band-momentum space with\nrespect to the spatial coordinates of the effective pseudoparticle lattices given in Eqs. (82), (83), and (84). Provided\nthat the discrete band-momentum values obey the boundary conditions associated with Eqs. (37) and (38), the form\nof the obtained states ensures the periodic boundary conditions of the original electronic problem. Such procedures\nlead to the following expression of the energy eigenstates in terms of the local states of Eq.

(93) generate a Slater determinant of the band momenta and the\nspatial coordinates of the Nc c pseudoparticles and N\u03b1, \u03bd \u03b1, \u03bd pseudoparticles belonging to branches \u03b1 = c, s and\n\u03bd = 1, 2, ... with finite occupancy in the corresponding local charge and spin sequences. On the left-hand side of Eq.\n(93) the set of pseudoparticle occupied band-momentum values specify the energy eigenstate. There (qj1 , qj2 , ..., qjNc )\nare the set of Nc occupied band momentum values out of the Na available discrete qj values of the c pseudoparticle\nband such that j = 1, ..., Na . Moreover,\n{(qj1 , qj2 , ..., qjN\u03b1, \u03bd )} = (qj1 , qj2 , ..., qjN\u03b1, 1 ); (qj1 , qj2 , ..., qjN\u03b1, 2 ); (qj1 , qj2 , ..., qjN\u03b1, 3 ); ... ,\n\u03b1 = c, s ,\n\n(94)\n\n\u2217\nare the set of N\u03b1, \u03bd occupied band momentum values out of the N\u03b1,\n\u03bd available discrete qj values of the \u03b1, \u03bd pseu\u2217\ndoparticle bands of branches \u03b1 = c, s and \u03bd = 1, 2, ... such that j = 1, ..., N\u03b1,\n\u03bd . Such band-momentum pseudoparticle\noccupancy configurations are discussed in Ref. [11].\nSince equations (77) and (91) refer to two different representations of the same states, the energy eigenstates (93)\nare Fourier-transform superpositions involving permutations of the local charge-sequence and spin-sequence states\n(91). The latter local states correspond to rotated-electron site distribution configurations. Thus combination of the\ngeneral expressions (80) and (93) provides important information about the relationship between the band-momentum\npseudoparticles and the rotated-electron occupancy configurations. We emphasize that the permutations on the righthand side of Eq. (93) are associated with different locations for the local \u03b1, \u03bd pseudoparticles but that the internal\nstructure of these quantum objects remains invariant under these permutations. Both the Fourier transforms and\npermutations of the general expression (93) do not touch the internal structure of the local \u03b1, \u03bd pseudoparticles and\nrefer only to their translational degrees of freedom. This results from the point-like character of the occupied sites of\nthe effective pseudoparticle lattices. Thus the local and band-momentum \u03b1, \u03bd pseudoparticles have the same internal\nstructure.\nWhile the complete set of symmetrized states used in Ref. [51] are energy eigenstates of the 1D Hubbard model\nin the limit U/t \u2192 \u221e only, the states given in Eqs. (93) and (94) are energy eigenstates of that model for all values\nof U/t. The local charge, spin, and c pseudoparticle sequences defined in expressions (77) and (80) and used in the\nconstruction of the latter states, describe rotated-electron site distribution configurations which in the limit U/t \u2192 \u221e\nrefer to similar electron configurations. Thus in contrast to the complete set of symmetrized energy eigenstates used\nin Ref. [51], the complete set of energy eigenstates of form (93) are in the limit U/t \u2192 \u221e the band-momentum states\nassociated with the unitary operator V\u0302 (U/t).\nIn the case of the energy eigenstates given in Eq. (93), a first condition for the fulfilment of the periodic boundary\nconditions of the original electronic problem is that in all the local charge and spin sequences described by the states\n(80), the local c, \u03bd pseudoparticles and s, \u03bd pseudoparticles are described by the same rotated-electron 2\u03bd-site distribution configurations given in Eqs. (58) and (59) respectively. These are obtained from the proper symmetrization\nof the corresponding single pseudoparticle 2\u03bd-site sequences. A second condition to ensure these periodic boundary\nconditions is that energy eigenstates given in Eq. (93) are Fourier transform superpositions of these charge and spin\nsequences of the form given on the right-hand side of that equation. Provided that the discrete values of the band\nmomentum qj of these Slater determinant superpositions obey Eqs. (37) and (38), the periodic boundary conditions\nof the original electronic problem are ensured. Note that the general expression provided in Eq. (93) includes suitable\n\n\f34\npermutations of the local sequences. In the same equation the rotated-electron site distribution configurations of the\nlocal charge and spin sequences associated with the states (77) or (80) are reexpressed in terms of pseudoparticle\noccupancy configurations of the corresponding effective pseudoparticle lattices.\nLet us consider the specific case of a ground state with electronic densities and spin densities belonging to the\ndomains 0 \u2264 n \u2264 1/a and 0 \u2264 m \u2264 n respectively. Such a state is a superposition of local normalized states (80)\nwhich have no finite occupancies of \u22121/2 Yang holons, \u22121/2 HL spinons, c, \u03bd pseudoparticles, and s, \u03bd pseudoparticles\nbelonging to branches such that \u03bd > 1 [12, 13]. Thus in the case of such a ground state these local states are of the\nfollowing simplified form,\n2Ns, 1 /2 |(0, 0); (xj1 , xj2 , ..., xjNc ); (xj1 , xj2 , ..., xjNs, 1 )i\ns,1\nhNY\n\ni\n(1 \u2212 T\u0302s, 1, j \u2032 , 1 ) |(0, 0); (j1 , j2 , ..., jNc ); {(\u2193lj\u2032 , 1 , \u2191lj\u2032 , 2 )}i ,\n\n(95)\n\n{(\u2193lj, 1 , \u2191lj, 2 )} = (\u2193l1, 1 , \u2191l1, 2 ), (\u2193l2, 1 , \u2191l2, 2 ), ..., (\u2193lNs, 1 , 1 , \u2191lNs, 1 , 2 ) ,\n\n(96)\n\n=\n\nj \u2032 =1\n\nwhere\n\nand the operators T\u0302s, 1, j \u2032\u2032 , 1 are the same as in the general Eq. (80). The states defined in Eqs. (95) and (96) provide\nthe position of the two rotated-electron singly occupied sites associated with the internal structure of each local s, 1\npseudoparticle.\nThese local states have an alternative representation in terms of the c and s, 1 pseudoparticle occupancy configurations of the effective c and s, 1 pseudoparticle lattices respectively. Within such an effective pseudoparticle lattice representation the local states (95) are denoted by |(0, 0); (xj1 , xj2 , ..., xjNc ); (xj1 , xj2 , ..., xjNs, 1 )i. Here\n(xj1 , xj2 , ..., xjNs, 1 ) are the spatial coordinates which define the positions of the local s, 1 pseudoparticles in the effective s, 1 pseudoparticle lattice. These spatial coordinates correspond to the indices (l1 , l2 , ..., lNs, 1 ) on the left-hand\nside of Eq. (95). The sites of such an effective s, 1 pseudoparticle lattice are equally spaced, the corresponding\nground-state lattice constant a0s, 1 being given in Eq. (87). The ground state expression is a particular case of the\nFourier-transform superposition of local states given in Eq. (93). In the case of the ground-state such an expression\nsimplifies to,\n|GSi = NaN\n=\n\n0\n\n/2\n\n0\n\n(N\u21910 )N\u2193 /2 |(0, 0); (qj1 , qj2 , ..., qjN 0 ); (qj1 , qj2 , ..., qjN 0 )i\n\u2193\n\nX\n\nX\n\n(\u22121)P e(ia\n\nc1 <c2 <...<cN 0 P\n\nP N0\n\nl=1\n\nX\n\ncP(l) qjl )\n\nX\n\n(\u22121)P e\n\n(ias, 1\n\nP N\u21930\n\nj \u2032 =1\n\ngP(l) qjl )\n\ng1 <g2 <...<gN 0 P\n\u2193\n\n\u00d7 |(0, 0); (xj1 , xj2 , ..., xjN 0 ); (xj1 , xj2 , ..., xjN 0 )i ,\n\n(97)\n\n\u2193\n\n0\n\u2217\nwhere Nc = N 0 , Ns, 1 = N\u21930 , and Ns,\n1 = N\u2191 .\n\nVI.\n\nPRACTICAL APPLICATION OF THE DERIVED LOCAL PSEUDOPARTICLE\nREPRESENTATION\n\nThe concepts of local pseudoparticle and of effective pseudoparticle lattice introduced in this paper are applied\nin the studies of Refs. [53, 54] to the evaluation of finite-energy few-electron spectral function expressions. In\nthis paper we identified the conjugate variable of the pseudoparticle band momentum obtained naturally from the\nBethe-ansatz solution in Ref. [11]. Such a conjugate variable is nothing but the spatial coordinate of the effective\npseudoparticle lattice. We found that there is one of such lattices for each pseudoparticle branch. Moreover, we\nstudied the pseudoparticle site distribution configurations which describe the energy eigenstates. We have also related\nthese configurations to the rotated-electron site distribution configurations which describe the same states. Since\nelectrons and rotated electrons are related by a mere unitary transformation, our results provide useful information\nabout the relation between electronic excitations and energy eigenstates.\nThe results obtained in this paper are used in Refs. [53, 54] in the evaluation of the overlap between few-electron excitations and energy eigenstates. As discussed in Ref. [53], the pseudoparticles studied here have residual interactions.\n\n\f35\nIn that reference it is found that a canonical unitary transformation maps the pseudoparticles onto non-interacting\npseudofermions. (This transformation is other than the electron - rotated-electron canonical unitary transformation\nassociated with the operator (11).) Interestingly, the latter quantum objects are more suitable for the evaluation of\nmatrix elements between the ground state and excited states. The pseudoparticle - pseudofermion unitary transformation maps the c pseudoparticle (and \u03b1, \u03bd pseudoparticle) discrete band momentum value qj onto the c pseudofermion\n(and \u03b1, \u03bd pseudofermion) discrete shifted momentum value q\u0304j = qj + Qc (qj )/L (and q\u0304 = qj + Q\u03b1, \u03bd (qj )/L). Here\nQc (q)/L and Q\u03b1, \u03bd (q)/L are momentum functionals which depend on the excited state occupancy configurations and\ninvolve the two-pseudofermion phase shifts. Although the momenta Qc (qj )/L and Q\u03b1, \u03bd (qj )/L are of order 1/L and\nplay a crucial role in the spectral properties of the quantum problem, the above transformation is such that the differences [Qc (qj+1 ) \u2212 Qc (qj )]/L and [Q\u03b1, \u03bd (qj+1 ) \u2212 Q\u03b1, \u03bd (qj )]/L are of order [1/L]2 and thus vanish within our large-L\ndescription. Therefore, to first order in 1/L the shifted-momentum values are such that q\u0304j+1 \u2212 q\u0304j = 2\u03c0/L, like the\ncorresponding band-momentum values. It follows that there is no level crossing between the sequence of {qj } discrete\nvalues and the corresponding sequence of {q\u0304j } discrete values such that j = 1, 2, ..., Na and j = 1, 2, ..., N\u03b1, \u03bd for the c\nand \u03b1, \u03bd branches respectively. Moreover, the presence of the extra momentum term Qc (qj )/L or Q\u03b1, \u03bd (qj )/L in the\nshifted-momentum expression does not affect the underlying effective \u03b1, \u03bd pseudoparticle lattice. Indeed, that momentum just imposes a twisted boundary condition such that each c pseudofermion (and \u03b1, \u03bd pseudofermion) hopping\n\u2217\niQc (q)\nfrom site Na to site 0 (and site N\u03b1,\n(and eiQ\u03b1, \u03bd (q) ).\n\u03bd to site 0) of such an effective lattice will acquire a phase e\nThus the effective pseudoparticle lattice introduced here is invariant under the pseudoparticle - pseudofermion transformation studied in Ref. [53].\nIn the case of the Hilbert subspace where the few-electron excitations are contained there is an one-to-one correspondence between the pseudofermion shifted-momentum occupancy configurations (and pseudofermion site distribution\nconfigurations) and the corresponding pseudoparticle band-momentum occupancy configurations (and pseudoparticle\nsite distribution configurations) that describe the energy eigenstates. Thus the results found in the present paper\nare useful for the description of these states in terms of pseudofermion occupancy configurations as well. Since the\npseudofermions are non-interacting, it is found in Ref. [53] that the wave function of the excited states of the groundstate normal-ordered 1D Hubbard model factorizes for all values of U/t. Importantly, such a factorization is used in\nRef. [54], where the few-electron spectral functions are expressed as a convolution of single pseudofermion spectral\nfunctions. This factorization involves the pseudofermion branches with finite occupancy in the excited states. Thus\ndue to such a factorization the problem of the evaluation of finite-energy few-electron spectral functions is reduced\nto the problem of the evaluation of pseudofermion spectral functions. The latter problem involves the derivation of\nmatrix elements between the ground state and excited states for pseudofermion operators.\nThe effective pseudoparticle lattices introduced in this paper play an important role in the evaluation of the pseudofermion matrix elements. It turns out that the derivation of the above matrix elements involves the anticommutator\n\u2020\n\u2020\n{fq\u0304,\n\u03b1, \u03bd , fq\u0304\u2032 , \u03b1\u2032 , \u03bd \u2032 } where the operators fq\u0304, \u03b1, \u03bd and fq\u0304, \u03b1, \u03bd create and annihilate respectively, a \u03b1, \u03bd pseudofermion\nof sifted momentum q\u0304, and similar operators can be introduced for the c pseudofermions. We note that because\nof the functional character of the momenta Qc (q)/L and Q\u03b1, \u03bd (q)/L these anticommutation relations have not the\nusual fermionic form. This justifies the designation pseudofermion. Furthermore, without the concept of local pseudoparticle and effective pseudoparticle lattice introduced in this paper the evaluation of these anticommutators would\nbe a complex open problem. However, our results imply the existence of local pseudofermions which correspond to\nthe local pseudoparticles introduced in this paper. Fortunately both the invariance of the pseudoparticle effective\nlattice under the pseudoparticle - pseudofermion transformation and the associated concept of local pseudofermion\nallows the expression of the above anticommutators in terms of the local pseudofermion operator anticommutators\n{fx\u2020j , \u03b1, \u03bd , fxj\u2032 , \u03b1\u2032 , \u03bd \u2032 } associated with spatial coordinates xj and xj \u2032 of the effective \u03b1, \u03bd and \u03b1\u2032 , \u03bd \u2032 lattices respectively.\nSuch an expression is very useful for the evaluation of the pseudofermion matrix elements between the ground state\nand excited states [53, 54]. As in the case of the pseudoparticles, also the shifted-momentum and local pseudofermion\ndescriptions are related by a simple Fourier transform [53]. Thus one can express the above shifted-momentum\npseudofermion operator anticommutators in terms of the local pseudofermion operator anticommutators as follows,\nN\u2217\n\nN\u2217\n\n\u03b1\u2032 , \u03bd \u2032\n\u03b1, \u03bd\n1 X X iq\u0304 xj \u2212iq\u0304\u2032 xj\u2032 \u2020\n\u2020\n{fq\u0304, \u03b1, \u03bd , fq\u0304\u2032 , \u03b1\u2032 , \u03bd \u2032 } =\ne\n{fxj , \u03b1, \u03bd , fxj\u2032 , \u03b1\u2032 , \u03bd \u2032 } .\nL j=1 \u2032\n\n(98)\n\nj =1\n\nAs a result of the introduction of the concept of effective pseudoparticle (and pseudofermion) lattice the derivation\nof the local operator anticommutators on the right-hand side of this equation is trivial and expressions for the bandmomentum anticommutators operators (98) can be easily obtained by performing the j and j \u2032 summations [53].\n\n\f36\nCorresponding expressions are found for the c pseudofermions such that,\n\n\u2020\n{fq\u0304,\nc , fq\u0304\u2032 , c } =\n\nNa\nNa X\n\u2032\n1 X\neiq\u0304 xj \u2212iq\u0304 xj\u2032 {fx\u2020j , c , fxj\u2032 , c } .\nL j=1 \u2032\n\n(99)\n\nj =1\n\nand the anticommutators involving \u03b1, \u03bd pseudofermions and c pseudofermions vanish. (Also the anticommutators\ngiven in Eq. (98) vanish for \u03b1, \u03bd 6= \u03b1\u2032 , \u03bd \u2032 [53].)\nWe note that the pseudofermion description introduced in Ref. [53] is a generalization for all values of U/t of the\nwell known U/t \u2192 \u221e quantum-object description used in Refs. [2, 3, 4, 5]. For instance, in the limit U/t \u2192 \u221e the\nc pseudofermions become the spin-less fermions of Refs. [2, 3, 4, 5, 49] and the spinons become the spins of these\nreferences. The s, 1 pseudofermions describe a spin pair of opposite projections. Also the remaining s, \u03bd pseudofermions\ndescribe 2\u03bd spins, \u03bd of each direction. In the limit U/t \u2192 \u221e the general c pseufofermion anticommutation relations\n(99) become nothing but the spin-less fermion anticommutation relations provided in the first (unnumbered) equation\nof Sec. IV of Ref. [5]. As discussed in Ref. [53] and confirmed in Ref. [54], except for the U/t dependence of\nthe two-pseudofermion phase shifts involved in the general expressions of the momentum functionals Qc (q)/L and\nQ\u03b1, \u03bd (q)/L, the evaluation of the pseudofermion matrix elements for finite values of U/t is formally similar to the\nderivation of the spin-less fermion matrix elements presented in Ref. [5] for U/t \u2192 \u221e. This similarity results from the\nfacts that both the energy-eigenstate rotated-electron occupancy configurations and corresponding pseudoparticle,\nholon, and spinon occupancy configurations introduced in this paper are independent of the value of U/t and that\nin the limit U/t \u2192 \u221e considered in Ref. [5] electrons and rotated electrons are the same quantum objects. This\nexample reveals how the local pseudoparticle (and pseudofermion) representation introduced in this paper is used\nfor practical calculations at finite U/t. The only formal difference between the finite U/t studies of Refs. [53, 54]\nand those of Ref. [5] for U/t \u2192 \u221e is that in the former references the evaluation of the spectral function for each\npseudofermion branch proceeds as in latter reference for the spin-less fermions. In contrast, the studies of Ref. [5] use\nthe well known U/t \u2192 \u221e connection between the spin degrees of freedom of the 1D Hubbard model and the spin 1/2\nisotropic Heisenberg chain [57] to evaluate the spin part of the one-electron spectral function. Such direct connection\ndoes not exist for finite values of U/t. However, the method used in Refs. [53, 54] for finite values of U/t is also valid\nfor U/t \u2192 \u221e and leads to the same final results as the analysis of Ref. [5].\nVII.\n\nCONCLUDING REMARKS\n\nIn this paper we studied the relation between the description of the energy eigenstates of the 1D Hubbard model\nin terms of rotated-electron occupancy configurations and of Yang holon, HL spinons, and pseudoparticle band\nmomentum occupancy configurations. Such a relation involves the concepts of local pseudoparticle and effective\npseudoparticle lattices. We introduced the pseudoparticle spatial coordinates xj associated with and conjugate of\nthe pseudoparticle band-momentum qj . The band-momentum pseudoparticle description is provided by the Betheansatz Takahashi's thermodynamic equations [7, 11]. The pseudoparticle spatial coordinates introduced in this paper\ncorrespond to effective pseudoparticle lattices whose length and lattice constant are independent of the value of U/t.\nThe introduction of the concept of pseudoparticle effective lattice involved the study rotated-electron distribution\nconfigurations of doubly occupied and empty sites (and of spin-down and spin-up singly occupied sites) which describe\nthe internal structure of the local c, \u03bd pseudoparticles (and local s, \u03bd pseudoparticles). In what the translational degrees\nof freedom are concerned, the local \u03b1, \u03bd pseudoparticle is a point-like quantum object, its internal structure being\nthe same as that of the corresponding band-momentum pseudoparticle. We also found that the spatial coordinates\nof the occupied and empty sites of the effective c pseudoparticle lattice are the same as the coordinates of the sites\nsingly occupied by rotated electrons and rotated-electron doubly occupied/empty sites respectively. The energy\neigenstates can be described in terms of pseudoparticle site distribution configurations in the corresponding effective\npseudoparticle lattice. Our results reveal that there is an one-to-one correspondence between the local pseudoparticle\nsite distribution configurations in the effective pseudoparticle lattices which describe a given energy eigenstate and\nthe rotated-electron site distribution configurations which describe the same state.\nAs mentioned in Sec. II, the electron site distribution configurations which describe the energy eigenstates are\nvery complex and dependent on the value of U/t. This is confirmed by the U/t dependence of the double occupation\nexpectation value studied in Ref. [12]. However, the electron - rotated-electron canonical unitary transformation is\nsuch that it maps these complex and U/t dependent electron site distribution configurations onto the corresponding\nU/t independent rotated-electron site distribution configurations studied in this paper. This is an important property\nof the non-perturbative diagonalization of the 1D Hubbard model. According to the results obtained in this paper,\nthis property implies that the local pseudoparticle site distribution configurations of the effective pseudoparticle\n\n\f37\nlattices which describe the energy eigenstates are also independent of the value of U/t. Moreover, since the spatial\ncoordinate of these effective lattices is the conjugate of the pseudoparticle band-momentum obtained from analysis\nof the Bethe-ansatz solution [11], it is again such a property which justifies why the pseudoparticle band-momentum\noccupancies which describe the energy eigenstates are independent of the values of U/t. The invariance associated\nwith the commutation of the momentum operator with the electron - rotated-electron unitary operator is related to\nthe U/t independence of the band-momentum pseudoparticle, rotated-electron, and local pseudoparticle occupancy\nconfigurations which describe the energy eigenstates. In this paper we profitted from such a U/t independence of\nthe pseudoparticle and rotated-electron occupancy configurations and extracted some of our results from analysis\nof the U/t \u2192 \u221e problem. In that limit the quantum problem simplifies because the \u03b7-spin and spin occupancy\nconfigurations are degenerated and electrons and rotated electrons are the same quantum object and thus electron\ndouble occupation is a good quantum number.\nWe also provided preliminary information about the application of the concepts of local pseudoparticle and effective\npseudoparticle lattice introduced in this paper to the evaluation of the spectral properties of few-electron operators.\nThe study of the finite-energy few-electron spectral functions is required for the further understanding of the unusual\nfinite-energy/frequency spectral properties observed in quasi-1D materials [15, 17, 18, 19, 21, 30], which are far from\nbeing well understood. Indeed there are clear indications that electronic correlations effects might play an important\nrole in the finite-energy physics of these low-dimensional materials [15, 17, 18, 19, 21, 30]. For low values of the\nexcitation energy the microscopic electronic properties of these materials are usually described by systems of coupled\nchains. On the other hand, for finite values of the excitation energy larger than the transfer integrals for electron\nhopping between the chains, 1D lattice models like the 1D Hubbard model are expected to provide a good description\nof the physics of these materials. The studies of the present paper are a first necessary step for the evaluation of\nfew-electron spectral function expressions for finite values of excitation energy, as confirmed in Refs. [53, 54]. As\nmentioned in Sec. I, application of a preliminary version of the theory introduced here and in these references to\nthe study of the one-electron removal spectral properties of quasi-1D materials leads to a quantitative and successful\ndescription of the exotic independent charge and spin spectral lines observed in photoemission experiments for all\nvalues of excitation energy [55].\nAcknowledgments\n\nWe thank Nuno Peres for useful discussions related to the occupancy configurations represented in the figures of\nthis paper and for valuable support in the production of these figures .

We start by considering the simple 1D Hubbard Hamiltonian given in Eq. (3) which\ndiffers from the Hamiltonians given in Eqs. (1) and (2) in the definition of the zero-energy level. The energy spectrum\nof the stationary states of the model (3) can written as a functional of the pseudoparticle band-momentum distribution\nfunctions and \u22121/2 Yang holon numbers such that [11, 12],\n\nEH = \u22122t\n\nNa\nX\n\nNc (qj ) cos k(qj )\n\nj=1\n\nN\u2217\n\n+ 4t\n\nc, \u03bd\n\u221e X\nX\n\n\u03bd=1 j=1\n\nNc, \u03bd (qj ) Re\n\nnq\no\n1 \u2212 (\u039bc, \u03bd (qj ) + i \u03bd U/4t)2 + U Lc, \u22121/2 .\n\n(A1)\n\nThis energy functional depends on these distribution functions through the momentum-rapidity functional k(qj ) and\nrapidity functional \u039bc, \u03bd (qj ) [11, 12]. The momentum spectrum P of the energy eigenstates has a simpler expression,\nbeing the linear superposition of the pseudoparticle band-momentum distribution functions and \u22121/2 Yang holon\nnumber. It reads,\n\n\f38\n\nP =\n\nNa\nX\n\n\u2217\nNs,\n\u03bd\n\nNc (qj ) qj +\n\n\u2217\nNc,\n\u03bd\n\nX\n\nNs, \u03bd (qj ) qj\n\nj=1\n\nj=1\n\n+\n\nX\n\nNc, \u03bd (qj ) [\n\nj=1\n\n\u03c0\n\u03c0\n\u2212 qj ] + Mc, \u22121/2 .\na\na\n\n(A2)\n\nAs in the case of the momentum values of the quasi-particles of a Fermi liquid, the momentum P given in Eq. (A2)\nis additive relative to the band-momentum values of the pseudoparticles.\nThe momentum rapidity functional k(qj ) and the rapidity functional \u039bc, \u03bd (qj ) on the right-hand side of Eq. (A1)\ncan be defined in terms of the Takahasi's thermodynamic equations [7] rewritten in functional form [11, 12]. These\nquantities are functionals of the set of band-momentum distribution functions Nc (qj ) and {N\u03b1, \u03bd (qj )}, where \u03b1 = c, s\nand \u03bd = 1, 2, ..., whose possible different occupancy configurations classify the energy eigenstates. In the limit\nU/t \u2192 \u221e these functionals have the same value for all energy eigenstates and read k(qj ) = qj and \u039bc, \u03bd (qj ) = 0.

For finite values of U/t the latter relation is replaced by Dr = Mc, \u22121/2 , where Dr is the rotated-electron double\noccupation. According to Eq.

On the other hand, the energy term \u2212 tU 4N n ln 2 1 \u2212 sin(2\u03c0n)\nincludes both kinetic and\n2\u03c0n\npotential energy contributions. It arises from hopping processes which change electron double occupation and lead to\nthe ground-state electron double occupation value given in Eq. (A6). Thus the physics associated with this second\nenergy term corresponds to excitation processes of higher order in t/U relatively to the t/U \u2192 0 limit where electron\ndouble occupation is a good quantum number and the ground-state electron double occupation of the 1D Hubbard\nmodel is exactly zero. If we include energy contributions of the order t(t/U )1 the ground state contains a small but\nfinite electron double occupation expectation value given in Eq. (A6) and the corresponding quantum problem is not\nequivalent to the physical situation of interest for the rotated-electron studies of this paper. Indeed, electrons equal\nrotated electrons when the limit t/U \u2192 0 is reached and double occupation is a good quantum number. Only in\nthat limit do the electron occupancy configurations which describe the band-momentum energy eigenstates equal the\ncorresponding rotated-electron configurations which are valid for all values of U/t.\n\n\f39\nNote that at half filling the electronic density reads n = 1/a, the energy term of order t(t/U )0 on the right-hand\nside of Eq. (A5) vanishes, and the ground-state energy and electron double occupation expressions given in Eqs.\n\u0010 \u00112\n2\n(A5) and (A6) simplify to E0 = \u2212 tU 4Na ln 2 and D0 = Ut 4Na ln 2 respectively. It is well known that this\n\nenergy can be associated with an isotropic Heisenberg model [57]. The corresponding ground state leads to energy\ncontributions of the order t(t/U )1 and thus contains a small but finite electron double occupation expectation value,\n\u0010 \u00112\nD0 = Ut 4Na ln 2. It follows that the usual description of the large-U/t half-filling Hubbard model in terms of an\nisotropic Heisenberg model is not equivalent to our limit. In that limit only hopping processes which do not change\nthe value of electron double occupation should be considered.\nTo leading order in the parameter t/U , the energy spectrum of the 1D Hubbard model in the limit t/U \u2192 0 is of\nthe form given in Eq. (31). The permitted hopping processes lead to contributions in the eigenstate energies of order\nR qc+\na\nt(t/U )\u22121 and t(t/U )0 . These contributions are associated with the energy terms N\n2\u03c0 qc\u2212 dq Nc (q)[\u22122t cos q] and U D\nrespectively, on the right-hand side of Eq. (31). In the particular case of the ground state there are no contributions\nof order t(t/U )\u22121 because the electron double occupation eigenvalue D0 is zero. In the limit t/U \u2192 0 only hopping\nprocesses such that the electron singly occupied sites can move relatively to the electron doubly-occupied and empty\nsite distribution configurations without changing these configurations are permitted. In such a limit there is a huge\ndegeneracy of \u03b7-spin and spin occupancy configurations. Thus there are several choices for complete sets of energy\neigenstates with the same energy and momentum spectra given in Eqs. (31) and (A3) respectively. This is because\nin this limit there are also many choices for complete sets of compatible observables. The 1D Hubbard model in the\nlimit of U/t \u2192 \u221e has been studied in the literature by many authors [2, 3, 4, 5, 40, 44, 45, 46, 48, 49, 50, 51]. In the\ncase of evaluation of quantities describing the physics of the model in the limit of U/t \u2192 \u221e, the alternative use of\ndifferent complete sets of states leads to the same final expressions for correlation functions and other quantities of\nphysical interest.\nIn this paper we are interested in one of these choices of energy eigenstates only. It corresponds to the complete set\nof 4Na energy eigenstates generated from the corresponding energy eigenstates of the finite-U/t 1D Hubbard model by\nturning off adiabatically the parameter t/U . Only that set of states correspond to the states obtained from the finite\nt/U states by the electron - rotated-electron unitary transformation. These states are common eigenstates of both\nthe 1D Hubbard model as U/t \u2192 \u221e and of the set of number operators {L\u0302\u03b1, \u22121/2 }, {N\u0302c (qj )}, and {N\u0302\u03b1, \u03bd (qj )} with\n\u03b1 = c, s and \u03bd = 1, 2, 3, ... in the same limit. Together with the Hamiltonian these operators constitute a complete set\nof compatible and commuting hermitian operators [13]. These operators also commute with the momentum operator\nP\u0302 . For these energy eigenstates the band momentum qj of the c pseudoparticles and c, \u03bd and s, \u03bd pseudoparticles such\nthat \u03bd = 1, 2, ... is a good quantum number. This justifies the designation of band-momentum energy eigenstates.\nHowever, in the limit t/U \u2192 0 there are other choices for complete sets of energy and momentum eigenstates which\nare due to the periodic boundary conditions of the original electronic problem. In such a limit the 1D Hubbard model\ncan be mapped onto a problem for which the number of doubly occupied sites is conserved [40, 50]. Since in the\nlimit t/U \u2192 0 the ground state has zero double occupation, one usually introduces the concepts of lower and upper\nHubbard bands which are associated with the Hilbert subspaces spanned by states with zero and finite values of the\ndouble occupation respectively [40, 50]. In the particular case of excitations involving creation of an electron the upper\nHubbard band corresponds to the Hilbert subspace spanned by states with a single doubly occupied site. Within the\nt/U \u2192 0 scheme used in Refs. [40, 50] one spectrally decomposes the elementary electronic operators into those which\nsolely act in the upper or lower Hubbard bands, and eliminate perturbatively those parts which couple the two bands.\nThis is achieved by application of a suitable transformation that eliminates these parts to a given order in t/U . Such\na transformation is nothing but the electron - rotated-electron unitary transformation in the limit of small values of\nt/U . This procedure leads to an effective Hamiltonian which is equivalent to the 1D Hubbard model to lowest order\nin t/U . In reference [51] that effective Hamiltonian was called Harris-Lange model. In reference [13] the concepts of\nlower and upper Hubbard bands were generalized to all values of t/U and associated with the rotated-electron double\noccupation.\nAPPENDIX B: DESCRIPTION OF A LOCAL c, 4 PSEUDOPARTICLE IN TERMS OF\nROTATED-ELECTRON SITE DISTRIBUTION CONFIGURATIONS\n\nIn this Appendix we illustrate for the specific case of a local c, 4 pseudoparticle how the rotated-electron site\ndistribution configurations which describe a local \u03b1, \u03bd pseudoparticle always involve a number \u03bd of site pairs such\nthat x = g and x\u2032 = g + \u03bd where g = 1, ..., \u03bd. In the present case we have that \u03b1 = c and thus the rotated-electron\nsite distribution configurations correspond to doubly occupied and empty sites. Moreover, since \u03bd = 4 a local c, 4\npseudoparticle involves four site pairs such that x = g and x\u2032 = g + 4 where g = 1, 2, 3, 4. Once there are two possible\n\n\f40\nrotated-electron site occupancies for each pair and the number of pairs of each local c, 4 pseudoparticle is four, the\ntotal number of different internal rotated-electron site distribution configurations is 24 = 16. According to the general\nexpression (58) these 16 different internal rotated-electron site distribution configurations of doubly occupied and\nempty sites are such that,\n8\nhY\n\nx=1\n\nei\u03c0hj, x D\u0302j, x\n\n4\ni hY\n\ng=1\n\ni\n(1 \u2212 T\u0302c, 4, j, g )\n\n\u00d7 (\u2022hj, 1 , \u2022hj, 2 , \u2022hj, 3 , \u2022hj, 4 , \u25e6hj, 5 , \u25e6hj, 6 , \u25e6hj, 7 , \u25e6hj, 8 ) =\n+ ei\u03c0[hj, 1 +hj, 2 +hj, 3 +hj, 4 ] (\u2022hj, 1 , \u2022hj, 2 , \u2022hj, 3 , \u2022hj, 4 , \u25e6hj, 5 , \u25e6hj, 6 , \u25e6hj, 7 , \u25e6hj, 8 )\n\u2212 ei\u03c0[hj, 2 +hj, 3 +hj, 4 +hj, 5 ] (\u25e6hj, 1 , \u2022hj, 2 , \u2022hj, 3 , \u2022hj, 4 , \u2022hj, 5 , \u25e6hj, 6 , \u25e6hj, 7 , \u25e6hj, 8 )\n+ ei\u03c0[hj, 1 +hj, 3 +hj, 6 +hj, 8 ] (\u2022hj, 1 , \u25e6hj, 2 , \u2022hj, 3 , \u25e6hj, 4 , \u25e6hj, 5 , \u2022hj, 6 , \u25e6hj, 7 , \u2022hj, 8 )\n\u2212 ei\u03c0[hj, 1 +hj, 3 +hj, 4 +hj, 6 ] (\u2022hj, 1 , \u25e6hj, 2 , \u2022hj, 3 , \u2022hj, 4 , \u25e6hj, 5 , \u2022hj, 6 , \u25e6hj, 7 , \u25e6hj, 8 )\n+ ei\u03c0[hj, 1 +hj, 2 +hj, 7 +hj, 8 ] (\u2022hj, 1 , \u2022hj, 2 , \u25e6hj, 3 , \u25e6hj, 4 , \u25e6hj, 5 , \u25e6hj, 6 , \u2022hj, 7 , \u2022hj, 8 )\n\u2212 ei\u03c0[hj, 1 +hj, 2 +hj, 4 +hj, 7 ] (\u2022hj, 1 , \u2022hj, 2 , \u25e6hj, 3 , \u2022hj, 4 , \u25e6hj, 5 , \u25e6hj, 6 , \u2022hj, 7 , \u25e6hj, 8 )\n+ ei\u03c0[hj, 1 +hj, 4 +hj, 6 +hj, 7 ] (\u2022hj, 1 , \u25e6hj, 2 , \u25e6hj, 3 , \u2022hj, 4 , \u25e6hj, 5 , \u2022hj, 6 , \u2022hj, 7 , \u25e6hj, 8 )\n\u2212 ei\u03c0[hj, 1 +hj, 2 +hj, 3 +hj, 8 ] (\u2022hj, 1 , \u2022hj, 2 , \u2022hj, 3 , \u25e6hj, 4 , \u25e6hj, 5 , \u25e6hj, 6 , \u25e6hj, 7 , \u2022hj, 8 )\n+ ei\u03c0[hj, 2 +hj, 3 +hj, 5 +hj, 8 ] (\u25e6hj, 1 , \u2022hj, 2 , \u2022hj, 3 , \u25e6hj, 4 , \u2022hj, 5 , \u25e6hj, 6 , \u25e6hj, 7 , \u2022hj, 8 )\n\u2212 ei\u03c0[hj, 1 +hj, 6 +hj, 7 +hj, 8 ] (\u2022hj, 1 , \u25e6hj, 2 , \u25e6hj, 3 , \u25e6hj, 4 , \u25e6hj, 5 , \u2022hj, 6 , \u2022hj, 7 , \u2022hj, 8 )\n+ ei\u03c0[hj, 3 +hj, 4 +hj, 5 +hj, 6 ] (\u25e6hj, 1 , \u25e6hj, 2 , \u2022hj, 3 , \u2022hj, 4 , \u2022hj, 5 , \u2022hj, 6 , \u25e6hj, 7 , \u25e6hj, 8 )\n\u2212 ei\u03c0[hj, 2 +hj, 5 +hj, 7 +hj, 8 ] (\u25e6hj, 1 , \u2022hj, 2 , \u25e6hj, 3 , \u25e6hj, 4 , \u2022hj, 5 , \u25e6hj, 6 , \u2022hj, 7 , \u2022hj, 8 )\n+ ei\u03c0[hj, 2 +hj, 4 +hj, 5 +hj, 7 ] (\u25e6hj, 1 , \u2022hj, 2 , \u25e6hj, 3 , \u2022hj, 4 , \u2022hj, 5 , \u25e6hj, 6 , \u2022hj, 7 , \u25e6hj, 8 )\n\u2212 ei\u03c0[hj, 3 +hj, 5 +hj, 6 +hj, 8 ] (\u25e6hj, 1 , \u25e6hj, 2 , \u2022hj, 3 , \u25e6hj, 4 , \u2022hj, 5 , \u2022hj, 6 , \u25e6hj, 7 , \u2022hj, 8 )\n+ ei\u03c0[hj, 5 +hj, 6 +hj, 7 +hj, 8 ] (\u25e6hj, 1 , \u25e6hj, 2 , \u25e6hj, 3 , \u25e6hj, 4 , \u2022hj, 5 , \u2022hj, 6 , \u2022hj, 7 , \u2022hj, 8 )\n\u2212 ei\u03c0[hj, 4 +hj, 5 +hj, 6 +hj, 7 ] (\u25e6hj, 1 , \u25e6hj, 2 , \u25e6hj, 3 , \u2022hj, 4 , \u2022hj, 5 , \u2022hj, 6 , \u2022hj, 7 , \u25e6hj, 8 ) .\n\n(B1)\n\nOn the left-hand side of this equation the site-hj, x rotated-electron double occupation operator D\u0302j, x has eigenvalue\n1 and 0 when that site is doubly occupied by rotated electrons and free of rotated electrons respectively, and the\noperator T\u0302c, 4, j, g acts on the pair of sites of indices hj, g and hj, g+4 only. This operator is designed to act onto the\nrotated-electron eight-site distribution configuration of the particular form illustrated on the left-hand side of Eq.\n(B1). This specific configuration is such that the first four sites are doubly occupied by rotated electrons and the\nfollowing four sites are free of rotated electrons. From the application of this operator onto such a rotated-electron\neight-site distribution configuration a new distribution configuration is generated where the site of index hj, g is free\nof rotated electrons, the site of index hj, g+4 is doubly occupied by rotated electrons, and the occupancy of the\nother six sites remains unchanged. This operation is repeated according to the products on the left-hand side of Eq.\n(B1) and leads to the 16 internal rotated-electron site distribution configurations on the right-hand side of the same\nequation. These configurations are generated by considering that in each of the g = 1, 2, 3, 4 pairs of sites of indices\nhj g and hj, g+4 , the site of index hj g is doubly occupied by rotated electrons and the site of index hj, g+4 is free of\nrotated electrons and vice versa. The phase factors appearing on both sides of the above equation result from the\nmomentum \u03c0/a associated with each rotated-electron doubly occupied site. This is the momentum of the \u22121/2 holon\ncorresponding to such a site. Finally note that a similar description is obtained for the s, 4 pseudoparticle provided\nthat one replaces these phase factors by one and the rotated-electron doubly occupied and empty sites by spin-down\nand spin-up rotated-electron singly occupied sites respectively.\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n\nF.

In the particular case of\nx = 1 and x\u2032 = 2 the figure represents the hj, 1 \u2194 hj, 2 site pair of a c, 1 pseudoparticle or of the lj, 1 \u2194 lj, 2 site pair of a s, 1\npseudoparticle.\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFIG. 2: Graphical representation of charge sequences of a zero \u03b7-spin energy eigenstate with no Yang holons and two rotatedelectron doubly occupied sites and two rotated-electron empty sites only. The hj, g \u2194 hj, g+\u03bd site pairs are represented as in\nFig. 1. We note that the relative height of different site pairs has no physical meaning. The goal of using site pairs of different\nheight is just to clearly define the two sites of each pair. In figures (a) and (b) two possible rotated-electron doubly occupied\nsite/empty site pair distribution configurations are represented. The figures show how these distribution configurations change\nas a result of a cyclic permutation which transforms the first site of the charge sequence onto its last site. The distribution\nconfiguration (a) transforms onto itself whereas the distribution configuration (b) transforms onto two c, 1 pseudoparticles.\nThus according to property 6-III the distribution configuration (a) describes a c, 2 pseudoparticle. Note that the distribution\nconfiguration (b) describes two c, 1 pseudoparticles. The distribution occupancies of the figure describe alternatively s, 1 and\ns, 2 pseudoparticles. In this case the spin sequences correspond to a zero spin energy eigenstate with no HL spinons and with\ntwo spin-down singly occupied sites and two spin-up singly occupied sites only.\n\n\f44\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nFIG. 3: Graphical representation of charge sequences of a zero \u03b7-spin energy eigenstate with no Yang holons and three rotatedelectron doubly occupied sites and three rotated-electron empty sites only. The hj, g \u2194 hj, g+\u03bd site pairs are represented as in\nFig. 1. In figures (a) and (b) it is shown how two possible rotated-electron doubly occupied site-empty site pair distribution\nconfigurations change as a result of a cyclic permutation which transforms the first site of the charge sequence onto its last\nsite. The distribution configuration (a) transforms onto itself whereas the distribution configuration (b) transforms onto a\nnon-equivalent distribution configuration. Thus according to property 6-III the distribution configuration (a) describes a c, 3\npseudoparticle. The figures represent alternatively spin sequences of a zero spin energy eigenstate with no HL spinons and with\nthree spin-down singly occupied sites and three spin-up singly occupied sites only.\n\nFIG. 4: Graphical representation of a domain of a charge sequence of the effective electronic lattice including fourteen sites.\nThe hj, g \u2194 hj, g+\u03bd site pairs are represented as in Fig. 1. The six sites with no vertical lines correspond to Yang holons. There\nare two local c, 1 pseudoparticles described by hj, 1 \u2194 hj, 2 site pairs and a local c, 2 pseudoparticle described by a hj, 1 \u2194 hj, 3\nand a hj, 2 \u2194 hj, 4 site pairs. Alternatively, if we replace the Yang holons by HL spinons and the c, \u03bd pseudoparticles by s, \u03bd\npseudoparticles the figure represents the domain of a spin sequence with six HL spinons, two s, 1 pseudoparticles, and a s, 2\npseudoparticle.\n\n\f45\n\nx\n\nx\n\nx\n\nFIG. 5: An illustration of the possible positions of a local c, 1 pseudoparticle when it passes from the left to the right-hand\nside of a steady local c, 1 pseudoparticle. The hj, 1 \u2194 hj, g+\u03bd site pairs are represented as in Fig. 1. In the three rotatedelectron site distribution configurations (a)-(c) the charge-sequence position of the steady pseudoparticle is labelled by a X and\nremains unchanged. These three rotated-electron site distribution configurations correspond to three different charge sequences.\nAlternatively, the figure represents the corresponding electron site distribution configurations of two s, 1 pseudoparticles in three\ndifferent spin sequences.\n\n\f46\n\n(a)\nx\n\n(b)\nx\n\n(c)\nx\n\n(d)\nx\n\n(e)\nx\n\nFIG. 6: An illustration of the possible positions of a local c, 1 pseudoparticle when it passes from the left to the right-hand side\nof a steady local c, 2 pseudoparticle. The hj, g \u2194 hj, g+\u03bd site pairs are represented as in Fig. 1. In the five rotated-electron site\ndistribution configurations (a)-(e) the charge-sequence position of the steady c, 2 pseudoparticle is labelled by a X and remains\nunchanged. If instead we consider a steady local c, 1 pseudoparticle, figures (a)-(e) illustrate the possible positions of a local c, 2\npseudoparticle when it passes from the right to the left-hand side of a steady local c, 1 pseudoparticle. However, in this second\ncase the charge-sequence position of the local c, 1 pseudoparticle should remain unchanged and the X point of figures (a)-(e)\nshould be moved accordingly. In both cases these five distribution configurations correspond to five different charge sequences.\nAlternatively, the figure represents the corresponding electron site distribution configurations of a s, 1 pseudoparticle and a s, 2\npseudoparticle.\n\n\f"}
