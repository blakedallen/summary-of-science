There was negligible reduction in transmission\nspectrum of LF S \u2212 3 crystal measured in 30 days after irradiation.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nConstruction of the electromagnetic calorimeters for the experimental setups at LHC and\nILC colliders require use of new radiation hard fast materials such as heavy scintillators\nand Cherenkov radiators, because of the planned high luminosities for these accelerators.\nAt present scintillating lead tungstate crystals P bW O4 are successfully used in ALICE\nand CMS experiments at LHC. It is well known, that dominant radiation damage of\nscintillating crystals is a hadron induced one because of the large flux and interaction\ncross section. During last decade radiation damages of P bW O4 crystals were extensively studied by CMS collaboration using pion and proton beams. [1\u20134] It was found,\nthat high-energy pions and protons cause hadron-specific cumulative damage of P bW O4\ncrystals. Studies of CMS collaboration showed, that an important limitation for the\n1\n\n\fexisting lead tungstate crystals at HLLHC (and possible even at LHC) appears to come\nfrom \"star\" formation under irradiation by high energy hadrons through nuclear fission.\nTherefore, search of heavy, fast and radiation resistant against hadron irradiation scintillating crystals is very important now. Recently CMS collaboration has published their\nresults on proton induced damage in scintillating CeF3 crystals, a potential candidate\nfor electromagnetic calorimetry at HLLHC. [5]\nBelow we present the first results on measurements of radiation damage of LF S\ncrystals caused by 155 MeV/c proton beam.\n\n2\n\nResults and discussion\nTable 1: The basic properties of the scintillating crystals.\nMaterial\n\nNaI(T l)\n\nLFS-3\n\nLFS-8\n\nDensity, \u03c1 (g/cm3 )\n\n3.67\n\n7.35\n\n7.4\n\nMelting point, (0 C)\n\n651\n\n2000\n\n2000\n\nRadiation length, X0 (cm)\n\n2.59\n\n1.15\n\n1.14\n\nMoliere radius, Rm (cm)\n\n4.3\n\n2.09\n\n2.07\n\nLight output (%)\n\n100\n\n85\n\n82\n\nDecay time, (ns)\n\n230\n\n35\n\n19\n\nPeak emission, (nm)\n\n410\n\n425\n\n422\n\nRefractive index, n\n\n1.85\n\n1.81\n\n1.81\n\nHardness, (Moh)\n\n2\n\n5\n\n5\n\nHygroscopic\n\nYes\n\nNo\n\nNo\n\nin maximum of emission\n\nProprietary, bright scintillators LF S (Lutetium Fine Silicate) developed by Zecotek\nImaging Systems Pte Ltd provide much improved scintillating parameters and reproducibility [6]. LF S is a brand name of the set of Ce-doped scintillation crystals of the\nsolid solutions on the basis of the silicate crystal, comprising lutetium and crystallizing\n2\n\n\fin the monoclinic system, spatial group C2/c, Z = 4. The patented LF S compositions\nis Cex Lu2+2y\u2212x\u2212z Az Si1\u2212y O5+y , where A is at least one element selected from the group\nconsisting of Ca, Gd, Sc, Y , La, Eu and T b. The raw materials were 99.999% pure\nLu2 O3 , SiO2 and the scintillating CeO2 dopant.\nThe LF S crystals demonstrated stable scintillation parameters for top and bottom\nends of large boules in comparison with LSO. The most important parameters of two\ntypes of LF S scintillating crystals in comparison with characteristics of common inorganic scintillator NaI(T l) are presented in Table 1. The main properties of LF S crystal\nmake it highly suitable as a scintillating material for electromagnetic calorimeters in high\nenergy particle physics experiments. Earlier radiation damage of new heavy LF S \u2212 3\ncrystal has been studied using powerful 60 Co source at the dose rate of 4 Krad/min. No\ndeterioration in optical transmission of LF S \u2212 3 crystal was observed after irradiation\nwith the dose 23 Mrad. [7]\nThe large LF S \u2212 3 and LF S \u2212 8 crystals were grown by Zecotek Imaging Systems\nPte Ltd, Division of Zecotek Photonics Inc., Vancouver, Canada with the Czochralski\ntechnique. The initial crystal boules have been cut up to the samples with the dimensions\nof 11 \u00d7 11 mm2 and 20 mm long. All crystals samples have been polished to an optical\ngrade. The crystals were packed to 3 \u00d7 2 matrix for simultaneous irradiation with proton\nbeam from ITEP proton synchrotron. The proton beam with diameter \u223c 50 mm was\nparallel to long size of 3 \u00d7 2 crystal matrix. The beam uniformity was about \u2264 5%\nover the whole beam spot. All crystals have been irradiated to a 155 MeV/c protons up\nto fluence of 4.4 * 1012 p/cm2 . Optical transmission spectra across a 20 mm thickness\nwere measured with a spectrophotometer (Shimadzu UV-3101PC) before and at various\nintervals after proton irradiation.\nDue to induced radioactivity of LF S crystals first measurements of optical transmission of crystals were made in 30 days after proton irradiation.\nThe transmission spectra for LF S \u2212 8 and LF S \u2212 3 crystals are presented in Fig. 1\nand Fig. 2. Spontaneous recovery at room temperature was observed for LF S \u2212 8 crystal\nduring ten months after irradiation. It is evident, that irradiated LF S \u2212 3 crystal has\nnegligible reduction in transmission spectrum measured in 30 days after irradiation.\n\n3\n\nConclusions\n\nThe results of studies on radiation damage of different LF S crystals by using 155 MeV/c\nproton beam from ITEP proton synchrotron are presented. A significant progress has\nbeen made in the development of LF S crystals which could be used as the active medium\nof a fast performance electromagnetic calorimeter for a wide range of particle physics\napplication. The obtained results indicate, that LF S \u2212 3 seems to be the best in terms\n3\n\n\fFigure 1:\nTransmission spectra of\nLF S \u2212 8 crystal before and at various intervals after irradiation(sample thickness\n20 mm).\n\nFigure 2:\nTransmission spectra of\nLF S \u2212 3 crystal before and at various\nintervals after proton irradiation(sample\nthickness 20 mm).\n\nof radiation resistance against hadron irradiation among all other crystals used in highenergy physics experiments.\n\nReferences\n[1] M.
