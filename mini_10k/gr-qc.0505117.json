In particular, considerable attention has\nbeen paid to the study of 't Hooft-Polyakov magnetic monopole solutions\nof coupled Yang-Mills\u2013Higgs (YMH) systems [2, 3]. Magnetic monopoles\nare important because they are present in a wide range of gauge theory\nmodels. Moreover, their existence can be used to provide an account on\nvarious physical phenomena, including e.g. the quantized nature of electric\ncharge. In a recent paper by the present authors [4] a report is provided\non the numerical study on the behavior of strongly excited BogomolnyPrasad-Sommerfield (BPS) magnetic monopoles [5, 6]. In a related article\nby Forg\u00e1cs and Volkov [7] the same system is investigated by perturbative\nmethods. There is a striking consistency between the key results of these\ntwo independent studies. The aim of the present paper is to provide more\ndetailed description of the system based on the results obtained by the\nnumerical investigations of [4].\nThe investigated dynamical magnetic monopole is a solution of a coupled SU (2) YMH system. The Yang-Mills field is represented by an su(2)valued vector potential Aa and the associated 2-form field Fab reads as\n\u2217 Bolyai\n\nJ\u00e1nos Research Fellow of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences\n\n1\n\n\f2\n\nFodor and R\u00e1cz\n\nFab = \u2207a Ab \u2212 \u2207b Aa + ig [Aa , Ab ]\n\n(1)\n\nwhere [ , ] denotes the product in su(2) and g stands for the gauge coupling constant. The Higgs field (in the adjoint representation) is given by\nan su(2)-valued function \u03c8 while its gauge covariant derivative reads as\nDa \u03c8 = \u2207a \u03c8 + ig[Aa , \u03c8]. The dynamics of the investigated YMH system\nis determined by the Lagrangian\n\u0002\n\u00032\nL = T r(Fef F ef ) + 2T r(De \u03c8De \u03c8) + \u03bb T r(\u03c8\u03c8) \u2212 v 2 ,\n(2)\n\nwhere \u03bb is the self interaction constant of the Higgs field. In order to have\nfinite energy solutions the value of T r(\u03c8\u03c8) must tend to v 2 as the distance\nfrom the monopole goes to infinity. The energy-momentum tensor of the\nYMH field takes the form\n\u0014\n\u0015\n1\n1\nTab = \u2212\nT r(Fae Fb e ) \u2212 T r(Da \u03c8Db \u03c8) + gab L .\n(3)\n4\u03c0\n4\n\nOur considerations are restricted to spherically symmetric configurations yielded by the 'minimal' dynamical generalization of the static\n't Hooft-Polyakov magnetic monopole configurations [2, 3] (see also [8]).\nAccordingly, the evolution takes place on Minkowski spacetime the line\nelement of which, in spherical coordinates (t, r, \u03b8, \u03c6), is\n\u0001\nds2 = dt2 \u2212 dr 2 \u2212 r 2 d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8 d\u03c62 ,\n(4)\n\nwhile the Yang-Mills and Higgs fields, in the so called abelian gauge, are\nassumed to posses the form\n1\nAa = \u2212 [w {\u03c42 (d\u03b8)a \u2212 \u03c41 sin \u03b8(d\u03c6)a } + \u03c43 cos \u03b8(d\u03c6)a ]\ng\n\u03c8 = H\u03c43 ,\n\n(5)\n(6)\n\nwhere the generators {\u03c4I } (I=1,2,3) of su(2) are related to the Pauli matrices \u03c3I as \u03c4I = 21 \u03c3I , moreover, w and H are assumed to be smooth\nfunctions of t and r.\nIn the Bogomolny-Prasad-Sommerfield (BPS) limit, i. e. when \u03bb \u2192 0,\nthe mass of the Higgs boson becomes much less than the mass of the\nvector boson. The field equations in the \u03bb = 0 case become\n\u0002\n\u0001\n\u0003\nr 2 \u2202r2 w \u2212 r 2 \u2202t2 w = w w2 \u2212 1 + g 2 r 2 H 2\n(7)\nr 2 \u2202r2 H + 2r\u2202r H \u2212 r 2 \u2202t2 H = 2w2 H ,\n\n(8)\n\nwith the restriction that\nlim H = v ,\n\nr\u2192\u221e\n\n(9)\n\nin order to represent the BPS limit of finite energy solutions. We note\nthat the time independence of the limit value of H at both spacelike and\nnull infinity follows from the field equations (7) and (8) (see [9]).\nThe system of equations (7) and (8) with condition (9) has an analytic\nsolution, the static BPS monopole [5, 6]\n\u0014\n\u0015\ngvr\n1\n1\nw0 =\n,\nH0 = v\n\u2212\n.\n(10)\nsinh(gvr)\ntanh(gvr)\ngvr\n\n\f3\n\nFodor and R\u00e1cz\n\nIn the rest of the paper considerations will be restricted to the \u03bb = 0\ncase and strong impulse type excitations of the BPS monopole will be\ninvestigated.\nIn the BPS limit the Higgs field becomes massless and the only scale\nparameter of the system is the vector boson mass mw = gv. Since in the\ncase considered here v 6= 0, the rescalings t \u2192 t\u0303 = tmw , r \u2192 r\u0303 = rmw and\nH \u2192 H\u0303 = H/v transform the parameters to the value g = v = 1. This\nimplies that it suffices to consider the evolution of the g = v = 1 system\nnumerically and to study merely the dependence of the evolution on the\nvarious initial conditions for this system.\nTo have a computational grid covering the full physical spacetime \u2013\nensuring thereby that the outer grid boundary will not have an effect on\nthe time evolution \u2013 the technique of conformal compactification, along\nwith the hyperboloidal initial value problem, is used. This way it is possible to study the asymptotic behavior of the fields close to future null\ninfinity, as well as, the inner region for considerably long physical time\nintervals.\nThe conformal transformation we use is a slight modification of the\nstatic hyperboloidal conformal transformation applied by Moncrief [10].\nIt is defined by introducing first the new coordinates T and R instead of\nt and r as\n\u221a\np\n\u03c9 2 r2 + 1 \u2212 1\nT = \u03c9t + 1 \u2212 \u03c9 2 r 2 + 1 and R =\n,\n(11)\n\u03c9r\nwhere \u03c9 is an arbitrary positive constant. The Minkowski spacetime is\ncovered by the coordinate domain given by the inequalities \u2212\u221e < T <\n+\u221e and 0 \u2264 R < 1. The R = const. lines (same as the r = const.\nlines) represent world-lines of 'static observers', while the T = const.\nhypersurfaces are hyperboloids of the Minkowski spacetime satisfying the\nrelation (\u03c9t + 1 \u2212 T )2 \u2212 \u03c9 2 r 2 = 1. The constant \u03c9 is introduced here in\norder to have control on the size of the monopole region in terms of the\nR coordinate, which is useful for the optimization of the numerical code.\nIn the rest of the paper we present results obtained by setting \u03c9 = 0.05.\nThe line element of the conformally rescaled metric geab = \u03a92 gab in the\ncoordinates (T, R, \u03b8, \u03c6) takes the form\n\u0001\n\u03a92 2\ndT + 2RdT dR \u2212 dR2 \u2212 R2 d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8 d\u03c62\n2\n\u03c9\nwhere the conformal factor is\nde\ns2 =\n\n\u03a9 = \u03c9(1 \u2212 R2 )/2 .\n\n(12)\n\n(13)\n\nThe R = 1 coordinate line represents I + through which the conformally\nrescaled metric geab smoothly extends to the unphysical coordinate domain\nwith R > 1. The simple relation r\u03a9 = R holds between the old and new\nradial coordinates.\nUsing the substitution H(t, r) = h(t, r)/r + v the field equations (7)\nand (8) in the new coordinates read as\nh\n\u0001\n\u00012 i\n(14)\nPw = w w2 \u2212 1 + g 2 h + vR\u03a9\u22121\n\u0001\nPh = 2 h + vR\u03a9\u22121 w2 ,\n(15)\n\n\f4\n\nFodor and R\u00e1cz\n\nwhere the differential operator P is defined as\n\u0014 2\n\u03a9 2\n4R2\n\u2202 \u2212 \u2202T2 \u2212 2R\u2202R \u2202T\nP =\n(R2 + 1)2 \u03c9 2 R\n\u2212\n\n\u0015\n2\u03a9\n\u03a9R(R2 + 3)\n.\n\u2202\n\u2212\n\u2202\nT\nR\n\u03c9(R2 + 1)\n\u03c9(R2 + 1)\n\n(16)\n\nThese equations can be put into the form of a first order strongly hyperbolic system [9]. The initial value problem for such a system is known to\nbe well-posed [11]. In particular, we solved this first order system numerically by making use of the 'method of line' in a fourth order Runge-Kutta\nscheme following the recipes proposed by Gustafsson et al [11]. All the\ndetails related to the numerical approach, including representations of\nderivatives, treatment of the grid boundaries are to be published in [9].\nThe convergence tests justified that our code provides a fourth order representation of the selected evolution equations. Moreover, the monitoring\nof the energy conservation and the preservation of the constraint equations, along with the coincidence between the field values which can be\ndeduced by making use of the Green's function and by the adaptation of\nour numerical code to the case of massive Klein-Gordon fields, made it\napparent that the phenomena described below have to be, in fact, physical\nproperties of the magnetic monopoles.\nIn each of the numerical simulations initial data on the T = 0 hypersurface was specified for the system of our first order evolution equations. In\nparticular, a superposition of the data associated with the BPS monopole,\n(10), and of an additional pulse of the form\n\uf8f1\nh\ni\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f2 c exp (r\u2212a)d2 \u2212b2 , if r \u2208 [a \u2212 b, a + b];\n(\u2202T w)\u25e6 =\n(17)\n\uf8f4\n\uf8f3\n0,\notherwise,\n\nwith a \u2265 b > 0, which is a smooth function of compact support, was\nused. This choice, providing non-zero time derivative for w, corresponds\nto \"hitting\" the static monopole configuration between two concentric\nshells at r = a \u2212 b and r = a + b with a bell shape distribution. Basically\nthe same type of evolution occurs when instead of (\u2202T w)\u25e6 we prescribe\n(\u2202T h)\u25e6 in a similar fashion. The only distinction is that in this later case\nthe energy of the pulse is given directly to the massless Higgs field which\ncarries immediately a considerably large portion of it to I + before the\nYang-Mills field could take it over to feed it into the breathing state of the\nmonopole and into the expanding oscillations of the massive Yang-Mills\nfield.\nAll the simulations shown below refer to the same pulse shape (17)\ncorresponding to the choice of the parameters a = 2, b = 1.5 and d = 10,\nonly the amplitude c is varied. It is important to keep in mind that the\nenergy of the pulse is proportional to c2 . For example, for the case c = 70\npresented in [4] it is 55.4% of the energy of the static monopole, which is\nclearly not just a simple perturbation. We would also like to emphasize\nthat the figures shown below are typical in the sense that for a wide range\nof the parameters characterizing the exciting pulse, qualitatively, and in\n\n\f5\n\nFodor and R\u00e1cz\n\ncertain cases even quantitatively, the same type of responses are produced\nby the monopole [9].\nIn order to provide a better picture about the size and distribution of\nthe monopole and its relation to the initial data it is instructive to plot\nthe energy density distribution on the T = 0 initial hypersurface. The\nconserved energy current vector j a = T a b ua is formed from the energy\n\u2202\nmomentum tensor T a b , where u = \u2202t\nis the velocity vector of the the static\nobservers characterized by the constant value of r along their worldline.\nThe projection \u03b5 = j a na = \u03c9T 0 0 (R2 + 1)\u03a9\u22121 /2, where na is the future\npointed unit normal to the constant T hypersurfaces, gives a gauge invariant quantity characterizing the energy density on these surfaces. The\nenergy\nassociated to shells of radius R can be calculated as\np\nR \"density\"\nE = \u03b5 |h|d\u03b8d\u03c6 = 2\u03c0\u03c9T 0 0 (R2 + 1)R2 \u03a9\u22124 , where h is the determinant\nof the induced metric on the constant T hypersurfaces. On Fig. 1 we plot\nthe value of \u03b5 and E for the static monopole both with and without an\ninitial deformation of the form of (17). The plot of E is more instructive\nbecause its integral from the center R = 0 to null infinity R = 1 (i. e.\nthe area below the curve) gives the total energy of the system along the\nchosen constant T hypersurface. As the time passes, the value of this\nintegral decreases exactly by the energy radiated to null infinity.\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\nr\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n0\n\n0.35\n\n500\n\nc=0\nc=35\nc=70\n\n0.3\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\nr\n8\n\n10 12 14 16 18\nc=0\nc=35\nc=70\n\n400\n0.25\n300\n\n\u03b5\n\n\u03b5\n\n0.2\n0.15\n\n200\n0.1\n100\n0.05\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n0.02 0.04 0.06 0.08 0.1 0.12 0.14\nR\n\n0\n\n0.05 0.1 0.15 0.2 0.25 0.3 0.35 0.4\nR\n\nFigure 1: Energy density distributions \u03b5 and E on the T = 0 initial hypersurface\nfor the static BPS monopole (c = 0) and for two different choices of the initial\namplitude c.\nChoosing temporarily c = 70, we consider next the quantity w, corresponding to the massive Yang-Mills field, plotted on succeeding T = const.\nhypersurfaces, providing thereby a spacetime picture of its time evolution\n(see Fig. 2). One can see the formation of expanding shells of high frequency oscillations in the asymptotic region [12]. These shells take out\nenergy from the central monopole region, although they never reach null\ninfinity because of their massive character.

The amplitude of the oscillations can be evaluated\nby observing that at the center w = 1, while at infinity w = 0, always holds.\n\nother gauge variable, the massless Higgs field h is strikingly different (see\nFig. 3). There is no sign of the high frequency oscillations in h, justifying\nthat the two fields effectively decouple in the asymptotic region. Since the\noscillations in h are nonzero at null infinity, the direct energy transport\nto I + by the Higgs field, with the velocity of light, is apparent.\nFrom Fig. 2 and Fig. 3 it appears that the lower frequency oscillations\nare not concentrated only at the monopole but they are present basically\neverywhere. However, if one considers the clearly physically meaningful\nquantity, the energy density E corresponding to spherical shells of radius\nR, it is apparent that the oscillations are concentrated at the central\nregion, forming a long lasting 'breathing state' of the monopole. In Fig.\n4 we show the energy density difference E \u2212 E0 in a large central region,\nwhere E0 is the energy density of the static monopole. (See Fig. 1 of [4]\nfor the plot of E up to null infinity.) Although Fig. 4 covers a relatively\nearly time period, the picture remains essentially the same for the rest of\nthe time evolution when taking time intervals of the same length, with\nthe only difference of an overall decrease of its amplitude proportional to\nT \u22125/6 (see Fig. 5 of [4]).\nNext we consider the dependence of the energy density oscillations on\nthe amplitude of the initial deformation. The energy density \u03c1 = Tab ua ub\nobserved by static Minkowski observers cannot be used to form a conserved quantity when integrating on the hyperbolic T = const. hypersurfaces. However, for our specific choice \u03c9 = 0.05 the T = const. hyperboloids are so close to the flat t = const. surfaces in the inner monopole\nregion that plots of the quantities \u03b5 and \u03c1 are almost indistinguishable.\n\n\f7\n\nFodor and R\u00e1cz\n\nr\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n70\n\n100\n\n200 1000\n\n3.5\n3\n2.5\n\nT\n\n2\n1.5\n1\n0.5\n0\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\nR\n\nFigure 3: Spacetime diagram showing the time evolution of the variable h corresponding to the massless Higgs component of the gauge field for the initial\namplitude choice c = 70.

Indeed, the\nenergy provided by the initial perturbation in those two cases are 0.00554\nand 0.554 percent, respectively, of the energy 4\u03c0 of the static monopole.\nFor the c = 70 case the energy given to the system is 6.966, which is\n55.4 percent of the energy of the initially static monopole. In this case\nthe behavior is clearly nonlinear initially, but after the direct pulses have\nleft the system the quasinormal oscillation of the monopole is still not\ntoo far from the linear regime. For c = 280 the additional energy is\n111.46, which is more than 8 times the energy of the static monopole. In\nthis case even the monopole oscillations show a different character at the\nbeginning, having a significantly lower frequency. However, in all cases,\nthe frequency of the monopole oscillations tend as t\u22122/3 to the asymptotic\nvalue 1 corresponding to the vector boson mass in our rescaled coordinates\n(see Fig. 5 of [4]).\nAfter the initial period, i.e. for t > 5, the monopole starts a quasiperiodic oscillation with amplitude decreasing as t\u22125/6 . It is visible that\nthe mean value of these oscillations, which represents the average energy\n\n\fFodor and R\u00e1cz\n\ndensity at the given radius is negative for large initial deformations. This\nmeans that the energy contained in the oscillating monopole region is actually smaller than the energy of the static monopole which is a clear manifestation of the nonlinear character of the evolution. As it was pointed\nout to us by Michael Volkov, this situation is similar to that where a large\nstone is dropped into a lake, and the water level decreases because of the\nsubmerging of the stone. This analogy, however, does not provide a completely satisfactory explanation in the monopole case, because the average\nenergy remains negative during the entire evolution, approaching merely\nin the asymptotic limit the static value from below. This might lead to\nthe interpretation that the monopole behaves like an extremely viscosal\nfluid.\nIn the last part of the paper we consider the energy radiatedRto null\nT\ninfinity up to the time T . This energy can be calculated as Er = 0 SdT\na\nwhere S = limr\u2192\u221e j ka with ka being the unit normal to the constant\nr hypersurfaces. The possibility that we could study this radiation, in\nparticular the evolution near I + , is due to the fact that the hyperboloidal\ninitial value problem was used in our numerical simulations. The radiation\narrives to I + when the light cone emanating from the outer edge of the\ninitial perturbation reaches null infinity, i.e. approximately at T = 0.86.\nFor small perturbations the radiated energy is proportional to the square\nof the initial amplitude. Hence we plot the rescaled energy Er /c2 on Fig.6\nfor various initial data specifications.\nThe energy given to the system by the initial deformation is approximately 0.0014216 * c2 . For small initial perturbations the total radiated\nenergy is 0.00068273 * c2 , which is 48.02 percent of the energy given to\nthe system. The rest of the energy is in the self-similarly expanding shells\nformed by the massive Yang-Mills field w. These shells get arbitrarily far\nfrom the monopole region, but because of their massive character their\nvelocity is smaller than the speed of light, whence they never reach null\ninfinity. Actually, the energy in the shells is initially a little bit larger\nthan the remaining 51.98 percent, since as we have seen, the average energy in the central monopole region is smaller than the energy of the static\nmonopole solution in the same region. As the time passes the amplitude\nof the monopole oscillations decreases and the mean value of the energy\ndensity approaches the static value from below. Accordingly, there is, although a low scale, energy transfer back to the monopole from the outer\nregions ensuring, in turn, that in the inner region the system will settle\ndown to the static monopole solution.\nWe would also like to emphasize that \u2013 as it is intuitively expected \u2013\nthe ratio between the energy carried by the shells and the energy radiated\nto I + depends on the profile of the initial excitation. It is found that in\ncase of the specific choice (17) this ratio depends on a, b and d, but for\nsmall amplitudes in the linear regime it is apparently independent of the\nparameter c.\nVarious new features of the evolution of excited SU (2) BPS monopoles\nhave been presented here. The results contained in the last part of this\npaper indicate that there remained a lot of interesting issues to be studied both numerically and analytically in the dynamical behavior of the\nt'Hooft-Polyakov monopoles.\n\n9\n\n\f10\n\nFodor and R\u00e1cz\n\n0.0006\n0.0005\n\nEr / c2\n\n0.0004\n0.0003\n0.0002\n\nc = 0.7\nc=7\nc = 70\nc = 280\n\n0.0001\n0\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\n1.8\n\nT\nc = 0.7 , Ef = 0.00068273\nc = 70 , Ef = 0.00062904\n\n0.0001\n\nEf - ( Er / c2 )\n\n10-4 T -2/3\n\n1e-05\n\n10\n\n100\nT\n\nFigure 6: The rescaled energy Er /c2 radiated by the system until time T for\nvarious initial amplitudes c.
