The first section concentrates upon the mathematics employed to represent and understand stellar structure and evolution.\nThe second section analyses two different explanations for the structure\nof spiral galaxies.\n\n1\n\nStellar structure and evolution\n\nA star forms when a body of gas contracts under its own gravitational attraction,\nand the pressure and temperature created at the centre of the agglomerated mass\nis sufficient to ignite the nuclear fusion of atomic nuclei. The radiation released\nas a by-product of the nuclear fusion eventually reaches the surface of the star\nand becomes starlight.\nNewtonian astrophysics represents the gaseous content of a star as a fluid\nwhich occupies a compact open subset \u03a9 \u2282 R3 of three-dimensional Euclidean\nspace. The fluid is considered to possess a mass density scalar field \u03c1 and a\npressure scalar field p. To study stellar structure in Newtonian astrophysics, it\nis common to assume that the star is spherically symmetric and static (timeindependent). The requirement that the star be static is equivalent to the\nrequirement that the star is in hydrostatic and thermal equilibrium. For a\nstatic spherically symmetric star, the fluid occupies a solid ball of radius r, the\nmass density and pressure are time independent, and the velocity vector of the\nfluid vanishes. Using spherical polar coordinates, (r, \u03b8, \u03c6), the pressure and the\ndensity are independent of the angular coordinates (\u03b8, \u03c6), but vary as a function\nof the radius r. The fluid is assumed to be self-gravitating and to satisfy the\nPoisson equation of Newtonian gravitation,\n\u22072 \u03a6 = \u22124\u03c0G\u03c1 ,\nwith respect to a gravitational potential scalar field \u03a6. \u22072 is the Laplacian, also\ndenoted as \u2206 in many texts.\n1\n\n\fThere are four differential equations which govern the structure of a static,\nspherically symmetric star. The four equations taken together constitute a coupled ('simultaneous') set of ordinary first-order, non-linear differential equations. We now proceed to introduce and discuss these equations.\nAssuming spherical symmetry and time-independence, the mass density is\na function of radius alone \u03c1(r), and from the definition of mass density and\nEuclidean geometry, it follows that m(r), the mass enclosed within the surface\nof radius r, is given by the expression:\nZ r\nm(r) =\n4\u03c0(r\u2032 )2 \u03c1(r\u2032 )dr\u2032 .\n0\n\n(The prime here simply indicates the use of a dummy variable for the integration.) This gives us our first differential equation for stellar structure, sometimes\ncalled the mass continuity equation:\ndm(r)\n= 4\u03c0r2 \u03c1(r) .\ndr\nThe Newtonian gravitational potential for a self-gravitating, spherically symmetric body satisfying the Poisson equation, is \u03a6 = \u2212Gm(r)r\u22121 . Given a gravitational potential \u03a6, the gravitational force exerted per unit mass is specified\nby the vector field \u2212grad \u03a6, and the gravitational force per unit volume is specified by F = \u2212\u03c1 grad \u03a6. Most texts denote the gradient operator as \u2207, but this\ncan be confused with the covariant derivative operator in differential geometry.\nWhilst the gradient of a scalar field is a contravariant vector field, the covariant\nderivative of a scalar field is a covariant vector field. Hence, to avoid confusion,\nwe shall write 'grad' rather than \u2207. Given a choice of coordinates (x1 , ..., xn )\non a manifold, and given a metric tensor field gij dxi \u2297 dxj which specifies the\ngeometry of space, the gradient of an arbitrary scalar field f can be expressed\nas\ngrad f = g ij\n\n\u2202f \u2202\n,\n\u2202xi \u2202xj\n\nwhere g ij is the inverse of the matrix gij . In the spherical polar coordinates we\nhave chosen, (x1 , x2 , x3 ) = (r, \u03b8, \u03c6), the flat Euclidean metric takes the form\nds2 = dr \u2297 dr + r2 d\u03b8 \u2297 d\u03b8 + r2 sin2 \u03b8d\u03c6 \u2297 d\u03c6 ,\nhence the gradient of f takes the form\ngrad f =\n\n\u2202f \u2202\n\u2202f \u2202\n\u2202f \u2202\n+ r2\n+ r2 sin2 \u03b8\n.\n\u2202r \u2202r\n\u2202\u03b8 \u2202\u03b8\n\u2202\u03c6 \u2202\u03c6\n\nAssuming spherical symmetry of the gravitational potential \u03a6 entails that\n\u2202\u03a6/\u2202\u03b8 and \u2202\u03a6/\u2202\u03c6 vanish, hence\n\n2\n\n\fd\u03a6 \u2202\ndr \u2202r\nd(\u2212Gm(r)r\u22121 ) \u2202\n=\ndr\n\u2202r\n\u22122 \u2202\n.\n= Gm(r)r\n\u2202r\nThe requirement of hydrostatic equilibrium corresponds to the requirement\nthat the inward gravitational force \u2212\u03c1 grad \u03a6 is balanced at each point by the\noutward pressure gradient force \u2212grad p:1\ngrad \u03a6 =\n\ngrad p + \u03c1 grad \u03a6 = 0 .\nSpherical symmetry entails that \u2202p/\u2202\u03b8 and \u2202p/\u2202\u03c6 vanish, hence\ndp \u2202\n\u2202\n= \u2212Gm(r)\u03c1(r)r\u22122\n.\ndr \u2202r\n\u2202r\nThis gives us our second differential equation for stellar structure:\ngrad p =\n\nGm(r)\u03c1(r)\ndP (r)\n.\n=\u2212\ndr\nr2\nLet l(r) denote the amount of energy passing through the surface of radius\nr per unit time. Let \u01eb(r) denote the energy production coefficient, the amount\nof energy released at radius r in the star per unit time and per unit mass. It\nfollows that 4\u03c0r2 \u03c1(r)\u01eb(r) is the energy released per unit time at radius r. A star\nin thermal equilibrium is an open system for which there are large energy flows\nout of the system, and in which there are significant temperature and pressure\ngradients, but in which, nevertheless, the temperature and pressure profile of\nthe star remain constant. For a star in thermal equilibrium, none of the energy\nreleased is used to heat up the star or change its volume. Hence, for such a star,\nthe rate of energy flow at radius r is given by the expression:\nZ r\nl(r) =\n4\u03c0(r\u2032 )2 \u03c1(r\u2032 )\u01eb(r\u2032 )dr\u2032 .\n0\n\nThis gives us our third differential equation of stellar structure,\ndl(r)\n= 4\u03c0r2 \u03c1(r)\u01eb(r) .\ndr\nFor a star of radius R the luminosity is defined to be L = l(R), the amount of\nenergy passing through the outer surface of the star per unit time. When a star\nresides in a state of thermal equilibrium, the total amount of energy produced\nby the star per unit time equals the amount of energy radiated from the outer\nsurface per unit time. Hence, the luminosity L of such a star is given by the\nequation:\n1 The\n\npressure at each radius is a sum of the gas pressure and the radiation pressure.\n\n3\n\n\fL=\n\nZ\n\nR\n\n4\u03c0r2 \u03c1(r)\u01eb(r)dr .\n\n0\n\nThe energy per unit time l(r) passing through the sphere of radius r can be\nexpressed as\nl(r) = 4\u03c0r2 F (r) ,\nwhere F is the energy flux, the energy flow per unit time per unit area. When\nthere is a temperature gradient in a body, energy flow will occur by conduction\nand radiation at the very least. Assuming, for simplicity, the absence of convection, the energy flux in a star can be broken down into a conductive energy\nflux Fcond (r) and a radiative flux Frad (r). In both cases, the energy flow is\nproportional to the temperature gradient as follows (Tayler 1994, p63):\nFcond (r) = \u2212\n\n4acT 3 (r) dT (r)\n,\n3\u03bacond(r)\u03c1(r) dr\n\nFrad (r) = \u2212\n\n4acT 3(r) dT (r)\n.\n3\u03barad(r)\u03c1(r) dr\n\nand\n\n\u03bacond , the coefficient of conductive opacity, measures the resistance to the flow of\nheat by conduction, and \u03barad , the coefficient of radiative opacity, measures the\nresistance to the flow of heat by radiation. a is the radiation density constant,\na = 7.57 \u00d7 10\u221215 erg cm\u22123 K\u22124 .\nAssuming that energy flow in a star is due to conduction and radiation,2 one\nobtains (Tayler 1994, p64):\nl(r) = 4\u03c0r2 (Fcond (r) + Frad (r)) = \u2212\n\n16\u03c0acr2 T 3 (r) dT (r)\n,\n3\u03ba(r)\u03c1(r)\ndr\n\nwhere\n1\n1\n1\n=\n+\n.\n\u03ba(r)\n\u03bacond (r) \u03barad (r)\nRe-arranging, one obtains the following differential equation for the temperature\ngradient in a star, which is the fourth equation governing stellar structure:\ndT (r)\n3\u03ba(r)\u03c1(r) l(r)\n.\n=\u2212\ndr\n4acT 3(r) 4\u03c0r2\nThe chemical composition of a spherically symmetric and static star can be\nspecified by a set of functions Xi (r), which specify the fraction of unit mass\nconsisting of nuclei of type i, for i = 1, ..., I. As such, \u03a3i Xi (r) = 1.3\n2 Conduction\n\nis only significant in 'compact' stars, i.e., white dwarf and neutron stars.\nis a common approximation to use only three fractions (X, Y, Z), which are such that\nX + Y + Z = 1, and which specify, respectively, the proportion of hydrogen, the proportion\nof helium, and the proportion of all other elements in the constitution of a star.\n3 It\n\n4\n\n\fBefore the equations of stellar structure can be solved, one must specify an\nequation of state for the pressure,\nP = P (\u03c1, T, X1 , ..., XI ) ,\nan expression for the energy production coefficient\n\u01eb = \u01eb(\u03c1, T, X1 , ..., XI ) ,\nand an expression for the opacity\n\u03ba = \u03ba(\u03c1, T, X1 , ..., XI ) .\nThese expressions are sometimes called the constitutive equations.\nIf these three functions are specified, and four boundary conditions are specified, then one can solve the four differential equations of stellar structure. The\nfour boundary conditions can be chosen to be:\nm=0,\n\nl=0\n\nat r = 0 ,\n\nand\n\u03c1=0,\n\nT = 0 at r = R .\n\nNote here that the star is idealised as an open solid ball of radius R, hence the\nboundary of the star at radius R is not itself considered to be part of the star.\nChoosing \u03c1 = 0 (or P = 0) and T = 0 at a finite radius r = R is merely a simple\nidealisation. In reality, the density, pressure and temperature of a star gradually\ndescend to the non-zero value of the interstellar medium in the neighbourhood\nof the star.\nSolving the four differential equations for stellar structure then gives the\nmass, pressure, energy flow and temperature as a function of radius. However,\nin practical terms, one might wish to specify the total mass M and chemical\ncomposition of a star, and then obtain, amongst other things, the radius of\nsuch a star in hydrostatic and thermal equilibrium. It is therefore conventional\nto re-cast the differential equations with mass m, rather than radius r, as the\nindependent variable. Doing so, one obtains (Tayler 1994, p70-71):\n1\ndr(m)\n=\n,\n2\ndm\n4\u03c0r (m)\u03c1(m)\ndP (m)\nGm\n=\u2212\n,\ndm\n4\u03c0r4 (m)\ndl(m)\n= \u01eb(m) ,\ndm\ndT (m)\n3\u03ba(m)l(m)\n=\u2212\n.\n2\ndm\n64\u03c0 acr4 (m)T 3 (m)\n5\n\n\fThe chemical composition of the star is then expressed in terms of functions\n{Xi (m) : i = 1, ..., I}.\nOne can then choose boundary conditions for the re-formulated equations of\nstellar structure, such as:\nr=0,\n\nl=0\n\nat m = 0 ,\n\nT =0\n\nat m = M .\n\nand\n\u03c1=0,\n\nAgain, one could choose P = 0 at m = M rather than \u03c1 = 0, and, again, this is\nmerely the simplest idealisation on offer.\nNow consider the relationship between theory and observation. The observational state of a star at a moment in time can be specified by just two\nparameters: its luminosity and 'surface' temperature. Let us take these in turn:\n1. If one calculates the distance to an observable star, say by parallax, then\none can infer the luminosity of the star from its apparent luminosity.\n2. Whilst the temperature of the surface of a star was idealised in the boundary conditions above to be zero, a more sophisticated model divides a star\ninto its interior and atmosphere. The lowest level of the atmosphere is\ncalled the photosphere, and the 'surface' temperature of a star is deemed\nto be the temperature of the photosphere. The temperature of a star's\nsurface, in this sense, is intimately related to the spectral type of the star,\ndefined by the absorption lines in the spectrum of light emitted by the\nphotosphere. Given that the temperature of a star's photosphere largely\ndetermines the type of its spectrum, the observational state of a star can\nbe specified by its luminosity and spectral type. There are ten spectral\ntypes which, in order of decreasing temperature, are referred to as O, B,\nA, F, G, K, M, R, N, and S.\nIf one knows both the luminosity and temperature of a star, then one can calculate the radius of the star. The luminosity of a star is a function of the radius\nR of the star and the effective4 surface temperature Te of the star, according to\nthe following expression,\nL = 4\u03c0R2 \u03c3Te4 ,\nwhere \u03c3 is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant, related to the radiation density constant a by \u03c3 = ac/4. Given L and Te , one can obviously use this expression to\ncalculate R.\nThe observational state of a star can be represented by a point on the\nHertzsprung-Russell diagram, a two-dimensional rectangle, coordinatized by luminosity on the vertical axis, and either spectral type or temperature on the\n4 Strictly, the effective surface temperature T is defined as the temperature of a black body\ne\nwith the same radius and luminosity as the star.\n\n6\n\n\fhorizontal axis. The observational history of a star traces out a path on the\nHertzsprung-Russell diagram.\nThe luminosity and temperature of a star in hydrostatic and thermal equilibrium are the observational properties which can be explained by solving the\ndifferential equations of stellar structure. This explanation falls under the aegis\nof the deductive-nomological (D-N) account of scientific explanation. In such\nexplanations, one explains certain phenomenal facts by logically deriving them\nfrom the conjunction of general laws and particular specified circumstances. In\nthis case, the mass and chemical composition of a star are the specified circumstances, and given a specification of the constitutive equations, one can explain\nthe luminosity and temperature of a star from the conjunction of the equations\nof stellar structure and the given mass and chemical composition.\nThe initial mass and chemical composition of different stars vary, and these\nare the characteristics which determine the history and lifetime of a star on the\nHertzsprung-Russell diagram. Stars which are burning hydrogen into helium,\nin a state of hydrostatic and thermal equilibrium, occupy a roughly diagonal\nchannel, running from the top left to the bottom right of the HertzsprungRussell diagram, called the main sequence. The initial mass, and to a lesser\nextent, the initial chemical composition of a star, determine its initial location\nin the main sequence. Stars with greater initial mass are more luminous, and\noccupy positions further up the main sequence slope. The larger the mass and\nluminosity of a star, the shorter the length of time it will spend on the main\nsequence until its hydrogen fuel is expended.\nThe Vogt-Russell 'theorem', conjectured independently by Heinrich Vogt\n(1926) and Henry Norris Russell (Russell et al 1927, p910), states that with the\ntotal mass and chemical composition specified, the equations of stellar structure admit a unique solution. If true, the Vogt-Russell theorem would entail\nthat each mass and chemical composition corresponds to a unique equilibrium\nconfiguration. This, of course, is consistent with the fact that stars of the same\nmass but different chemical profile, can possess different equilibrium states. The\nchemical composition of a star will change during its lifetime as nuclear fusion\nconverts lighter elements into heavier elements, and a star will tend to pass\nthrough a sequence of different equilibrium configurations.\nHowever, whilst the Vogt-Russell theorem is essentially true, it is not strictly\ntrue, and it is certainly no theorem. A system of four coupled, non-linear, ordinary differential equations, with boundary conditions specified at two different\npoints, does not necessarily admit a unique solution. Whilst there is usually a\nunique equilibrium configuration for a given mass and chemical composition, for\nsome combinations of mass and chemical composition there are multiple solutions to the equations of stellar structure. The notion that there was actually a\n'theorem' was promulgated in textbooks, and never given a rigorous proof. As a\nconjecture, it is now known to be false. In fact, both the existence and uniqueness parts of the conjecture fail. For example, there is no solution composed\nof helium with a mass less than about 0.3 solar masses, and Cox and Salpeter\n(1964) demonstrated that there are two different solutions for stars of the same\nmass, burning purely helium, close to this minimum mass. This is referred to\n7\n\n\fas the double-valued helium main sequence, in the sense that, for some range of\nmasses, two values of radius R are possible for each value of mass. K\u00e4hler (1978)\ntracked the post main sequence evolution of the helium core of a star of two\nsolar masses, and found different equilibrium configurations of different radius,\nbut with the same mass. Gabriel and Noels-Gr\u00f6tsch (1968) demonstrated that\nthe minimum mass of a solution composed entirely of carbon is about 0.9 solar\nmasses, and that, once again, there are two possible solutions for each mass\nvalue greater than the minimum mass. In one branch of such double-valued\nmain sequences, the radius and luminosity increase with increasing mass, whilst\nin the other branch, there are smaller radii, and the luminosity decreases with increasing mass (Hansen 1978, p23). The latter, anomalous branches, correspond\nphysically to the presence of electron degeneracy. It is therefore not strictly\ntrue to say that the mass and chemical composition of a star in equilibrium\nuniquely determine its structure. However, as Hansen et al point out, \"the idea\nof uniqueness is still useful in that among a set of models all having the same\nmass and run of composition, usually only one seems to correspond to a real\nstar or to have come from some realistic line of stellar evolution. The others are\nunstable in some fundamental way (as far as we know),\" (2004, p331).\nGiven a fixed mass and chemical composition, each solution to the differential equations of stellar structure corresponds to a pair of values (Pc , Tc ) =\n(P (0), T (0)) for the central pressure and temperature of the star, or, equivalently, to a pair of values (R, L) = (r(M ), L(M )) for the surface radius and\nluminosity. The significance of this is that the radius R and luminosity L of a\nstar are both inferrable from observation. If the mass and chemical composition determined a unique solution, then the mass and chemical composition of a\nstar in equilibrium would uniquely determine its radius and luminosity (R, L).\nIf, on the contrary, there is no unique solution for a particular combination\nof mass and chemical composition, then there are multiple corresponding pairs\n{(R, L)i : i = 1, ..., n}.\nIf one drops the requirements of hydrostatic and thermal equilibrium, then\none can obtain the equations of stellar structure and evolution which govern the\nhistory of a Newtonian star. Assuming spherical symmetry, the equations are\n(Kippenhahn and Weigert 1990, p64):\n1\n\u2202r(m, t)\n=\n,\n\u2202m\n4\u03c0r2 (m, t)\u03c1(m, t)\n\u2202P (m, t)\n\u2202 2 r(m, t)\nGm\n1\n,\n=\u2212\n\u2212\n\u2202m\n4\u03c0r4 (m, t) 4\u03c0r2 (m, t)\n\u2202t2\n\u2202l(m, t)\n\u2202T (m, t) \u03b4(m, t) \u2202P (m, t)\n= \u01eb(m) \u2212 cP\n+\n,\n\u2202m\n\u2202t\n\u03c1(m, t)\n\u2202t\n3\u03ba(m, t)l(m, t)\n\u2202T (m, t)\n=\u2212\n.\n\u2202m\n64\u03c0 2 acr4 (m, t)T 3 (m, t)\nNotice that these are partial differential equations, whilst the equations of stellar\nstructure are ordinary differential equations. cP is the specific heat at constant\n8\n\n\fpressure and \u03b4 \u2261 \u2212(\u2202 ln \u03c1/\u2202 ln T )P , (see Kippenhahn and Weigert, p19). The\nfourth equation here continues to assume that energy transport is due to radiation and conduction alone, but this equation can be generalized.\nTime-dependence requires one to introduce additional equations for the timedependence of the mass fractions Xi :\n\u2202Xi (m, t)\nmi\n=\n(\u03a3j rji \u2212 \u03a3k rik ) ,\n\u2202t\n\u03c1(m, t)\n\ni = 1, ..., I .\n\nmi is the mass of the nuclei of type i, and rij is the rate at which nuclei of type\ni are transformed into nuclei of type j per unit volume.\nSolving these equations of stellar structure and evolution requires the specification of initial conditions as well as boundary conditions.\nThe histories of different star types can intersect when plotted as paths\non the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. For example, after a star of around one\nsolar mass has expended all the hydrogen in its core, it leaves the main sequence,\nincreasing in radius and decreasing in temperature, to the effect of a net increase\nin luminosity. This evolutionary path takes the star up the Hertzsprung-Russell\ndiagram to become a red giant. It then subsequently increases in temperature,\ncrossing the main sequence itself from right to left, before it sheds its outer\nlayers in the form of a so-called planetary nebula. Where this path crosses the\nmain sequence, the mass of the star is considerably below the mass of stars at\nthat point on the main sequence. If two different types of star can occupy the\nsame point on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, it entails that knowledge of\nthe luminosity and temperature of a star alone is not sufficient to determine the\nunique evolutionary history of a star. The Hertzsprung-Russell diagram does\nnot provide a state space for stars in the sense of a state space ('phase space')\nin Hamiltonian mechanics.\nNuclear fusion inside stars is responsible for creating almost all of the atoms\nin our universe which are heavier than hydrogen or helium. These heavier\nelements are generically called 'metals' by astrophysicists. During their lifetime,\nand particularly at the end of their lifetime, stars will eject a proportion of\ntheir mass into the interstellar medium, and this mass will contain, in some\nproportion, the metallic elements created by fusion. The mass returned into the\ninterstellar medium is re-cycled in the formation of subsequent generations of\nstars.\nThe stars in our galaxy are classified, in a coarse-grained fashion, as either\nPopulation I or Population II. The Population II stars were the first generation\nof stars formed in our galaxy, and as such, are metal-poor stars. Population\nI stars were formed from an interstellar medium which already contained the\nmetallic elements created by the first generation of stars, hence the Population I stars have a greater proportion of metallic elements in their chemical\nconstitution.\n\n9\n\n\fFigure 1: Spiral galaxy M74.\n\n2\n\nGalaxies\n\nA galaxy is a collection of \u223c 1011 stars, which is gravitationally bound together,\nand which is \u223c 105 light years in diameter. Stars within a galaxy are separated\nby distances of \u223c 10 light years, (Rindler 2001, p350). There are two main\ntypes of galaxy: spiral and elliptical. Most of the stars in a spiral galaxy are\nconcentrated in a flattened disk, which rotates about its center. The rotation,\nhowever, is not rigid, and the angular velocity of the rotation decreases as a\nfunction of radius. The average rotation period in a spiral galaxy is about\n100 million years, (ibid.). The disk of a spiral galaxy is surrounded by a more\ndiffuse 'halo' of stars, distributed in a spherically symmetric fashion. The halo\nis populated only by Population II stars. Whilst successive generations of stars\nform throughout most of the disk in a spiral galaxy, there is typically a bulge at\nthe center of the disk, and this bulge also tends to contain Population II stars.\nAt the very center of the disk there is typically a supermassive black hole. A\nspiral galaxy possesses an interstellar medium which consists of gas and dust.5\nThe stars in the disk of a spiral galaxy are not actually distributed in spiral\n5 In\n\nrelativistic cosmology, 'dust' means a pressure-less fluid. In astronomy and astrophysics, however, dust means tiny grains of solid matter (Nicolson 1999, p157).\n\n10\n\n\fpatterns. Rather, the spirals trace the brightest regions in the disk of the galaxy.\nThe brightest regions are those which contain both the O- and B-type stars and\nthe HII regions of ionized hydrogen, created by the ultraviolet radiation from\nthose high-temperature O and B-type stars. Because the brightest (high mass)\nstars are also the stars with the shortest lifetimes, the bright high-mass stars\ncan only be found in regions of recent star formation, and these regions happen\nto be the spiral arms.\nIn an elliptical galaxy, the stars are uniformly distributed within a 3dimensional ellipsoid, and there is no overall rotation. In fact, the velocities\nof the stars in an elliptical galaxy are randomly distributed in all directions.\nMuch like the halo of a spiral galaxy, there appears to be only one generation\nof star formation in an elliptical galaxy.\nOur own galaxy, the Milky Way, is a so-called barred-spiral, in which the\nspiral arms emanate from the ends of an apparently rigid bar of luminous matter,\n(Nicolson 1999, p206). There appear to be two main spiral arms in the Milky\nWay: the Norma arm and the Sagittarius arm. In addition, there are a number\nof smaller arms, and the Sun can be found within the Orion arm or 'spur', which\nlies outside the Sagittarius arm, and inside the Perseus arm (Nicolson p202).\nThe Sun resides inside a 'bubble' three-hundred light years in diameter, in which\nthe interstellar medium has been cleared by a supernova explosion (Smolin 1997,\np124). From this perspective, of the 1011 stars in our galaxy, only about 7000\ncan be seen with the naked eye, (Rindler p350). Moreover, only 1% of the light\nwhich falls upon the Earth comes from beyond our galaxy, (Disney 2000, p4).\nThe mutual gravitation of the stars in a galaxy define an escape velocity, and,\nat any one time, most of the stars in a galaxy will be moving with a velocity\nless than the escape velocity. In this sense alone, a galaxy cannot be treated\nas a collection of isolated, independent entities. Rather, a galaxy must be\nrepresented as a system, in the sense that it constitutes a collection of mutually\ninteracting parts. In a spiral galaxy in particular, one can treat the stars as the\nmembers of a population, and the interstellar medium as the environment with\nwhich that population interacts, via feedback loops. In this sense, it has been\nsuggested that a spiral galaxy can be treated as an ecological system, (Smolin\n1997, Chapter 9). Perhaps, however, it would be more accurate to say that\nbiological ecosystems and spiral galaxies are both instances of the same type of\nformal system. In other words, there is a type of formal system which contains a\npopulation, an environment, and a set of feedback loops between the population\nand the environment, and spiral galaxies provide instances of this system-type\njust as much as biological ecosystems do.\nSmolin asserts that \"There are processes by which the matter of the interstellar medium is converted into stars and there are processes by which matter\nis returned from the stars to the interstellar medium. To understand what a\ngalaxy is, and especially to understand it as a system, is then primarily to understand the processes that govern the flow of matter and energy between the\nstars and the interstellar medium,\" (1997 p118). He points out (p124) that the\ninterstellar medium is a system far from thermodynamic equilibrium, consisting\nof a number of different components of different densities, temperatures, and\n11\n\n\fcompositions. The different components include normal atomic gas; cold, dense\nGiant Molecular Clouds (GMCs); and regions of hot, dilute plasma, otherwise\nknown as HII regions, denoting ionized hydrogen. The relative amount of matter in these different components remains approximately constant over time.\nSmolin asserts that for a system to be in such a stable, but far-from-equilibrium\nstate, there must be processes which cycle the material among the different\ncomponents, and the rates of these processes must be controlled by feedback\nmechanisms.\nThe arms of a spiral galaxy trail behind with respect to the direction of\ngalactic rotation, hence the obvious explanation for their shape is simply the\nfact that the angular rotation velocity decreases with radial distance from the\ncentre of a galaxy. However, at the very least, this differential rotation cannot\nbe the sole explanation because spiral galaxies have existed for at least 10 billion\nyears, and given a typical rotation period of 100 million years, this means that a\ntypical spiral galaxy has completed at least 100 rotations, and \"would long ago\nhave wrapped its arms to extinction if they had been created early in its history\nand had not been sustained by some ongoing process,\" (Nicolson 1999, p208).\nObservations also suggest that the spiral arms do not rotate with the galaxy, but\nat a slightly slower rate. Note carefully, however, that an explanation which uses\ndifferential rotation in part is not excluded; it may still be possible to explain\nthe spiral arms by invoking differential rotation and an ongoing process which\ncontinually creates the arms. What cannot be done is to explain spiral arms\nsimply in terms of differential rotation acting upon the initial conditions under\nwhich galaxies are created. The burden of explanation has been shifted from the\ninitial conditions under which a spiral galaxy is created to the ongoing processes\nwhich continually operate within such a galaxy.\nThere are two processes which have been suggested to explain the ongoing\nformation of spiral arms: density-waves and self-propagating star formation.\nAs Nicolson (p208) points out, both processes may participate in spiral arm\nformation, and may be of differing importance in different types of spiral galaxy.\nThere are so-called 'grand-design' spirals, which possess thin, long and welldefined spiral arms (see Figure 2); there are flocculent spirals, which possess\nmany fluffy, poorly-defined spiral arms (see Figure 3); and there is a continuum\nof intermediate cases, of which the Milky Way is one such. Karttunen et al\npoint out that \"in multiarmed galaxies the spiral arms may be short-lived,\nconstantly forming and disappearing, but extensive, regular, two-armed patterns\nhave to be more long-lived,\" (2003 p359). As Nicolson suggests, density-wave\nmechanisms are more appropriate for grand-design spirals, and self-propagating\nstar formation is more appropriate for flocculent spirals.\nIt was Bertil Lindblad who suggested in the 1920s that spiral arms could\nbe produced by density waves propagating in a galaxy. The peaks and troughs\nof a density wave are independent of any particular elements from the medium\nthrough which the density wave is propagating. Thus, the density-wave explanation accepts that stars pass in and out of the spiral arms. However, it also\naccepts that spiral arms are genuine indicators of higher-than-average stellar\ndensity. The postulated density wave travels faster than the speed of sound in\n12\n\n\fFigure 2: Hubble Space Telescope image of M51, the Whirlpool galaxy.\nthe interstellar medium, and the shock wave purportedly triggers compression of\nthe interstellar medium, and the observed star formation in the spiral arms. The\nspiral arms therefore trace the brightest regions in the disk of a galaxy because\nthe brightest regions are those which contain the shortlived O- and B-type stars.\nAs Tayler states, \"the most massive stars have such a short lifetime that, by the\ntime they have ceased to be luminous, the spiral pattern has hardly changed its\nposition. They should therefore only be found in the spiral regions. . . Stars of\nlower mass, such as the Sun, have a main sequence lifetime which is equal to\nmany rotation periods of the pattern. Such stars should therefore be observed\nthroughout the disk with no significant correlation with the present position of\nthe spiral arms,\" (1993, p145).\nC.C.Lin and Frank Shu developed the density-wave idea further in 1964 by\npostulating that the stars in a spiral galaxy travel in slightly elliptical orbits\nwhich precess with the passage of time.6 This postulate was complemented by\nthe suggestion of J. Kalnajs in 1973 that if the orientation of the major axis of\nthese ellipses varies by a small angular increment at increasing distance from\nthe galactic centre, then the ellipses fail to be uniformly separated, and where\n6 See\n\nPasha (2004) for a detailed history of these ideas.\n\n13\n\n\fthey come close together, they produce the appearance of grand-design spiral\narms.\nKalnajs's explanation of spiral arms can be seen as a structural explanation,\nin the sense that the spiral arms are represented as structural elements in a\ngeometrical model, and these structural elements are linked to other structural\nelements in the model, namely the precessing elliptical orbits, each aligned at a\nsmall angle to the one inside it.\n\nFigure 3: Flocculent spiral galaxy NGC4414.\nNicolson suggests that density-wave spiral arms \"are probably sustained either by the asymmetric gravitational field associated with a central bar structure (typical of grand-design spirals) or by gravitational disturbances caused by\nneighboring galaxies, or by a combination of both,\" (1999, p208).\nIn the 1970s Mueller and Arnett suggested an alternative explanation for\nspiral arms, which rejects the idea that all spiral arms are density waves, and\npostulates instead that at least some are self-propagating waves of star formation. Unlike density waves, these waves purportedly do not require one to\npostulate external mechanisms, such as the asymmetric gravitational field of the\ncentral bar, or the tidal forces caused by other galaxies. Let us, then, examine\nstar formation processes in a little more detail.\nAs stated in Section 1, the mass and chemical composition of stars vary,\nand these are the characteristics which determine the history and lifetime of a\nstar. New stars are continually born in a spiral galaxy, but they are not born\nfrom other stars, and consequently the mass of a new star is not in any sense\ninherited. The first generation of stars must have formed from clouds of almost\npure hydrogen and helium. Subsequent generations of stars are observed to form\nfrom the cold, dense Giant Molecular Clouds of the interstellar medium. Given\nan environment which already contains surrounding stars, GMCs are only able\n14\n\n\fto remain cool because they contain dust, which acts as a shield to starlight, and\nbecause they contain organic molecules, which are able to radiate excess heat\n(Smolin p110). Organic molecules contain carbon, a by-product of the nuclear\nfusion processes in previous generations of stars.\nThe star-formation processes within GMCs are thought to be triggered by\nthe shock-waves from the supernovae explosions of nearby high-mass stars,\nformed within neighbouring GMCs 10 million years previously, or less. The\nshock-waves purportedly compress the interstellar medium, and instigate star\nformation. Because one spell of star-formation is triggered by the death of highmass stars from a previous spell of star-formation, this process is referred to as\nself-propagating star-formation (Smolin p128). Indeed, the inner lanes of spiral\narms are often observed to be dark and dusty, while the outer sides contain the\nstar-forming regions. This suggests the star formation is directed against the\ndirection of rotation, which would explain why spiral arms rotate slightly slower\nthan a host galaxy.\nNicolson (p208) suggests that after a burst of such self-propagating star formation, differential rotation stretches the region into a spiral arm. He suggests\nthat in a flocculent spiral, random bursts of star formation produce numerous\nspiral arms by this mechanism, each of which fades away after star formation has\nceased. Subsequent star formation elsewhere in the galaxy then creates more\nspiral arms. This differs somewhat from Smolin's notion of self-propagating star\nformation, in which he states that \"the waves of star formation neither die out,\nnor grow uncontrollably, but propagate at exactly the right rate to persist in\nthe galaxy indefinitely,\" (1997 p135).\nThe debate between the two different theories which attempt to explain\nspiral structure is particularly interesting when one appreciates that they take\nopposite stances on the basic cause and effect relationships which operate in\na spiral galaxy. The density wave theory represents a spiral to be a spiral of\ndensity waves, and explains star formation as the consequence of the density\nwaves. In contrast, the theory of self-propagating star formation represents\nspiral structure to be the consequence of waves of star formation, (Tayler 1993,\np145).\nIt would not be correct to say that the chemical composition of a new star is\nindependent of the chemical composition of previous generations of stars. The\nchemical composition of the interstellar medium in a spiral galaxy is changing\nwith the passage of time. The material expelled from one generation of stars\nprovides a high-metallicity contribution to the medium from which the next\ngeneration of stars is composed. High metallicity purportedly inhibits the formation of higher-mass stars, hence the relative birthrate of lower-mass stars in\na spiral galaxy increases with the passage of time. Accordingly, the birthrate\nof stars in the solar neighbourhood is claimed to be inversely proportional to\nmass m according to the Salpeter form, m\u22127/3 , (Tayler 1993, p149). It is also\nsuggested that the formation rate of high-mass stars is less than the formation\nrate of low-mass stars because the energy from a newly-created high-mass star\nheats up the medium from which it was born to such an extent that the star\nformation process halts, (Smolin p127). In general statistical terms, the number\n15\n\n\fdensity Nm of type-m objects in such a population is the product Nm = Bm * lm\nof the type-m birthrate Bm with the type-m life-time lm . If we let Nm denote\nthe number density of mass-m stars, then it follows that because small mass\nstars have a greater lifetime, even if they have the same birth-rate as high-mass\nstars, they will come to dominate the population. The eventual domination of\nlower-mass stars is therefore the consequence of both statistics and the physics\nof star formation processes. In a spiral galaxy, however, where the birthrates\nare far from being spatially homogeneous, and the majority of star formation\noccurs in the spiral arms, one cannot infer birthrates from the known lifetimes\nof stars and the observed number densities in regions which are remote from the\nstar formation in spiral arms.\nThe population of stars in a spiral galaxy is therefore a type of population in\nwhich: (i) there are variable characteristics distributed within the population,\nand a small subset of these characteristics define different types within the\npopulation; (ii) each member of the population has a finite lifetime, determined\nby the values of the type-defining characteristics; and (iii) new members of the\npopulation are not reproduced from existing members of the population, i.e.,\nnew members of the population are born without having any parent(s) in the\nexisting population. Suppose in addition that (iv) population members of each\ntype are created at approximately the same rate, or short-lifetime members are\ncreated at a lower rate than long-lifetime members. Such a population evolves to\nbe dominated by the long-lifetime objects. Such a population is neither evolving\nrandomly, nor is it evolving by natural selection.\n\nReferences\n[1] Cox, J.P., Salpeter, E.E. (1964). Equilibrium Models for Helium-Burning\nStars. III.
