Gavin\nPhysics and Astronomy Department, Wayne State University, 666 W Hancock, Detroit, MI 48201\n(Dated: November 17, 2018)\nScattering of particles produced in high energy nuclear collisions can wrestle the system into a\nstate near local thermal equilibrium. I illustrate how measurements of the centrality dependence of\nthe mean transverse momentum and its fluctuations can exhibit this thermalization.\n\narXiv:nucl-th/0308067v2 20 Apr 2004\n\nPACS numbers: 25.75.Ld, 24.60.Ky, 24.60.-k\nKeywords: Relativistic Heavy Ions, Event-by-event fluctuations.\n\nFluctuations of the net transverse momentum have recently been measured, with the STAR, PHENIX, NA49,\nand CERES experiments reporting substantial dynamic\ncontributions [1, 2, 3, 4]. Such fluctuations can provide\ninformation on collision dynamics and, perhaps, the QCD\nphase transition [5, 6]. Preliminary PHENIX and STAR\ndata in Au+Au collisions show that pt fluctuations increase as centrality increases [1, 2]. Importantly, data\nfrom these same experiments exhibit a strikingly similar increase in the mean transverse momentum hpt i, a\nquantity unaffected by fluctuations [7, 8].\nI ask whether the approach to local thermal equilibrium can explain the similar centrality dependence of hpt i\nand pt fluctuations. My focus is on fluctuations, to develop the appropriate theoretical tools and experimental\nobservables. Dynamic fluctuations are characterized by\nthe observable h\u03b4pt1 \u03b4pt2 i analyzed by STAR [1], where it\n2\n, and CERES [3]. For particles of\nis termed \u03c3hp\nt i, dynam\nmomenta p1 and p2 , one defines\nZ\n\u03c12 (p1 , p2 )\n\u03b4pt1 \u03b4pt2 ,\n(1)\nh\u03b4pt1 \u03b4pt2 i = dp1 dp2\nhN (N \u2212 1)i\nwhere \u03b4pti = pti \u2212 hpt i, h* * *i is the average over events,\nand dp \u2261 dyd2 pt . This definition exploits the relation of\nevent-by-event fluctuations to inclusive correlation functions discussed in [9]. The pair distribution is\n\u03c12 (p1 , p2 ) = dN/dp1 dp2 ,\n\n(2)\n\nR\nwhere \u03c12 dp1 dp2 = hN (N \u2212 1)i for multiplicity N [9].\nObserve that (1) depends only on the two-body correlation function\nr(p1 , p2 ) = \u03c12 (p1 , p2 ) \u2212 \u03c11 (p1 )\u03c11 (p2 )\n\n(3)\n\nwith \u03c11 (p) = dN/dp, since the integral over \u03c11 \u03c11 vanishes due to the definition of \u03b4pt . Alternative fluctuation\nobservables \u03a6pt , Fpt , and \u2206\u03c3pt proposed in [5], [1], and\n[2] measure many-body correlations of all orders. These\nquantities are roughly equivalent\nFpt \u2248 \u03a6pt /\u03c3 \u2248 \u2206\u03c3pt /\u03c3 \u2248 N h\u03b4pt1 \u03b4pt2 i/2\u03c3 2\n\n(4)\n\nwhen dynamic fluctuations are small compared to statistical fluctuations \u03c3 2 = hp2t i \u2212 hpt i2 [2, 10].\n\nSTAR measurements of pt fluctuations in fig. 1a show\nan increase for low multiplicities corresponding to peripheral collisions at s1/2 = 130 GeV [1]. PHENIX measurements at 200 GeV in fig. 1b also show such an increase for Fpt [2]. The increase appears to peak and\npossibly saturate for multiplicities corresponding to midperipheral impact parameters. In addition, the data may\nshow a decrease for \u2206\u03c3pt and Fpt for the most central collisions. While these measurements are preliminary and\nbear large uncertainties, this centrality dependence has\nalready been attributed to phenomena associated with\nthe QCD transition [11, 12].\nI attribute the trend in fig. 1 to the onset of thermalization in increasingly central collisions, motivated by a\nsimilar behavior of the measured hpt i in fig. 2 [7, 8]. Thermalization occurs as scattering between particles produced in the collision drives the system toward local thermal equilibrium. The system is characterized by a phase\nspace density f (x, p, t) that varies from collision event to\nevent. As the system approaches local equilibrium the\nevent-averaged hf i tends toward the Boltzmann-like distribution hf e i that varies in spacetime through the temperature T (x, t). I show here that thermalization alters\nthe average transverse momentum following\nhpt i = hpt io S + hpt ie (1 \u2212 S),\n\n(5)\n\nwhere S is the probability that a particle escapes the collision volume without scattering. Dynamic fluctuations\ndepend on two-body correlations and, correspondingly,\nare described by\nh\u03b4pt1 \u03b4pt2 i = h\u03b4pt1 \u03b4pt2 io S 2 + h\u03b4pt1 \u03b4pt2 ie (1 \u2212 S)2 .\n\n(6)\n\nThe initial quantities hpt io and h\u03b4pt1 \u03b4pt2 io are determined by the particle production mechanism, while hpt ie\nand h\u03b4pt1 \u03b4pt2 ie depend on the state of the system near\nlocal equilibrium.\nTo understand how thermalization can cause the common trends in figs. 1 and 2, observe that as centrality is increased, the system lifetime increases, eventually\nto a point where local equilibrium is reached. Consequently, the survival probability S in (5) and (6) decreases from unity as the impact parameter decreases.\nBoth (5) and (6) peak for impact parameters near the\n\n\f2\npoint where equilibrium is established. The behavior in\ncollisions at centralities beyond that point depends on\nhow subsequent hydrodynamic evolution changes hpt ie\nand h\u03b4pt1 \u03b4pt2 ie as the system size and lifetime increase.\nSystems formed in the most central collisions can experience cooling that reduces (5) and (6).\nFor both the average pt and its fluctuations to increase\nduring thermalization as in figs. 1 and 2, both hpt ie and\nh\u03b4pt1 \u03b4pt2 ie must exceed the initial values. For the average transverse momentum, this implies that the temperature T at thermalization must be quite high, since\nhpt ie \u221d T . A value hpt io \u2248 350 MeV near that measured\nin pp collisions implies T \u223c 400 MeV, suggesting that\npartons contribute to thermalization.\nIn the following paragraphs I estimate h\u03b4pt1 \u03b4pt2 io and\nh\u03b4pt1 \u03b4pt2 ie . Next, I formulate a nonequilibrium approach\ncapable of treating fluctuations based on the BoltzmannLangevin equation in the relaxation-time approximation.\nHere, I sketch the derivation of (5) and (6), leaving the\ndetails for a longer paper.\nTransverse momentum and particle density fluctuations arise partly due to the particle production mechanism, e.g., string fragmentation. These fluctuations were\nmeasured in proton-proton (pp) collisions [13]. To use\nthese pp results to estimate h\u03b4pt1 \u03b4pt2 io for nuclear collisions, I apply the wounded nucleon model to describe\nthe soft production that dominates hpt i and h\u03b4pt1 \u03b4pt2 i.\nThe charged particle multiplicity N and other extensive\nquantities are assumed to scale linearly with the number\nof participant nucleons M , while the intensive one-body\nobservable hpt i is independent of M . Centrality is determined by N/Nmax \u2248 M (b)/M (0) for impact parameter\nb, averaged over collision geometry.\nTo estimate the initial h\u03b4pt1 \u03b4pt2 i using the wounded\nnucleon model, I follow the appendix in ref. [9] to obtain\n\u0012\n\u0013\n2h\u03b4pt1 \u03b4pt2 ipp 1 + Rpp\n.\n(7)\nh\u03b4pt1 \u03b4pt2 io =\nM\n1 + RAA\nThe term outside the parentheses is expected because\n(1) measures relative fluctuations and, therefore, should\nscale as M \u22121 ; note that pp collisions have two participants. The term in parentheses accounts for the normalization of (1) to hN (N \u2212 1)i \u2261 hN i2 (1 + RAA ) rather\nthan hN i2 . From [9], the robust variance RAA satisfies\nZ\nr(p1 , p2 )\nhN 2 i \u2212 hN i2 \u2212 hN i\nRAA = dp1 dp2\n=\n(8)\nhN i2\nhN i2\n\nand scales as RAA \u221d M \u22121 . ISR measurements imply h\u03b4pt1 \u03b4pt2 ipp /hpt i2pp \u2248 0.015 [13]. HIJING gives\nRpp \u223c 0.45 and RAA \u223c 0.0037 for central Au+Au for the\nrapidity interval \u2206\u03b7 = 1.5 studied in [1]. To compare\n(7) to N h\u03b4pt1 \u03b4pt2 i/hpt i2 in fig. 1a, I assume central collisions produce N \u2248 825 charged particles in \u2206\u03b7 = 1.5,\ni.e., dN/d\u03b7 \u2248 550.\nNear local thermal equilibrium, dynamic fluctuations\noccur because initial state fluctuations result in transient\n\nspatial inhomogeneity that can survive thermalization.\nThe inhomogeneity would eventually disappear due to\ndiffusion and viscosity, but can be observed if freeze out is\nsufficiently rapid. Inhomogeneity is essential for dynamic\nfluctuations, since h\u03b4pt1 \u03b4pt2 i and \u03a6pt would otherwise\nvanish for \u03c12 = \u03c11 \u03c11 .\nTo see how inhomogeneity can survive thermalization,\nobserve that local equilibrium is achieved when the average phase space distribution of particles within a small\nfluid cell hf i relaxes to the local equilibrium form hf e i.\nThe time scale for this process is the relaxation time \u03bd \u22121\ndiscussed later. In contrast, density differences between\ncells must be dispersed by transport from cell to cell. The\ntime needed for diffusion to disperse a dense fluid mass\n2\nof size L \u223c (|\u2207n|/n)\u22121 is td \u223c \u03bdL2 /vth\n, where vth \u223c 1\nis the thermal speed of particles. This time can be much\nlarger than \u03bd \u22121 for a sufficiently large fluid mass. The\nrapid expansion of the collision system further prevents\ninhomogeneity from being dispersed prior to freeze out.\nInhomogeneity produces spatial correlations: it is more\nlikely to find particles together near a dense fluid mass.\nThese spatial correlations entirely determine the phasespace correlations when the momentum distribution at\neach point is thermal. I write\nZ\n(9)\nr(p1 , p2 ) = dx1 dx2 P(x1 , p1 , x2 , p2 , t)\nevaluated at the freeze out proper time \u03c4F , where the\nphase-space correlation function is\nP12 \u2261 hf1 f2 i \u2212 hf1 ihf2 i \u2212 \u03b412 hf1 i,\n\n(10)\n\nfor \u03b412 = \u03b4(x1 \u2212 x2 )\u03b4(p1 \u2212 p2 ). A small change in density\n\u03b4n will initially drive the system from equilibrium by an\namount \u03b4f e = f e \u03b4n/n.

The quantity F is dimensionless and depends on the ratio of the correlation length \u03bet\nto the transverse size Rt . I use (14) and (15) to compute\nF = kc(|rt1 \u2212 rt2 |)[T\u0302 (rt1 ) \u2212 1][T\u0302 (rt2 ) \u2212 1]k,\n\n(17)\n\na double density-weighted average over rt1 and rt2 . I\nfind F = 0.046 for \u03bet /Rt = 1/6. To determine (16) for\nfig. 1a, I take RAA = 0.0037 and N \u2248 825 as before. I\nemphasize that the HIJING RAA value builds in fluctuations from resonance decay and, moreover, is roughly\nconsistent with measured net charge fluctuations [14].\nLet us now describe the fast local relaxation of the\nphase space density f to f e . I start with a Boltzmannlike kinetic equation\n\u2202f /\u2202t + vp * \u2207f = I[f ] \u2248 \u2212\u03bd(f \u2212 f e ),\n\n(18)\n\napproximating the collision term I[f ] using a single relaxation time \u03bd \u22121 . Following [16, 17], I use longitudinal\nboost invariance to write the left side of (18) as df /d\u03c4 at\nfixed pz \u03c4 . Longitudinal expansion further implies that\nthe density satisfies n(\u03c4 ) \u221d \u03c4 \u22121 , while hpt ie \u221d T \u221d \u03c4 \u2212\u03b3\nfor 0 < \u03b3 < 1/3; see [17]. I then multiply both sides of\n(18) by |pt | and integrate over momentum to obtain\ni\n\u03b1hpt i0e h \u03b3/\u03b1\nS\n\u2212S .\n(19)\nhpt i = hpt io S +\n\u03b1\u2212\u03b3\nThe survival probability is\nR \u03c4F\n\u2212\n\u03bd(\u03c4 )d\u03c4\nS = e \u03c40\n\u2248 (\u03c40 /\u03c4F )\u03b1 ,\n\n(20)\n\nwhere \u03bd = h\u03c3vrel in(\u03c4 ), \u03b1 = \u03bd0 \u03c40 for the formation time\n\u03c40 , the scattering cross section is \u03c3, and vrel is the relative\nvelocity. For relevant values \u03b1 \u226b \u03b3, I approximate (19)\nby (5) with hpt ie \u2248 hpt i0e (\u03c40 /\u03c4 )\u03b3 .\nTo compute the evolution of h\u03b4pt1 \u03b4pt2 i, I obtain relaxation equations for P. Fluctuations due to scattering\nand drift are described by adding a Langevin force to the\nright side of (18) [15]. On a discrete phase space lattice\npi , xi , the Boltzmann-Langevin equation is\ndfi /d\u03c4 = \u2212\u03bd(fi \u2212 fie ) + \u03b6i\n\n(21)\n\nwhere \u03b6i (\u03c4 ) is a Langevin force. To incorporate the effect\nof fluctuations near local equilibrium, I further treat fie\nas a stochastic variable subject to an additional Langevin\nforce, so that dfie /d\u03c4 = \u03c7i , plus a diffusive relaxation\nterm that I need not specify for a diffusion time scale\ntd \u226b \u03bd \u22121 . The Langevin terms satisfy h\u03b6i (\u03c4 )\u03b6j (\u03c4 \u2032 )i =\n\u03bd(f + f e )\u03b4ij \u03b4(\u03c4 \u2212 \u03c4 \u2032 ) and h\u03b6i (\u03c4 )\u03c7j (\u03c4 \u2032 )i = \u2212\u03bdf e \u03b4ij \u03b4(\u03c4 \u2212\n\u03c4 \u2032 ), as required by detailed balance for the relaxationtime collision term [15]. The Boltzmann equation used\nto compute hpt i is the mean value of (21).\nI use standard methods [15] to obtain the following\ntwo-body relaxation equations\ndPij /d\u03c4 = \u22122\u03bdPij + \u03bd(Cij + Cji )\ne\ndCij /d\u03c4 = \u2212\u03bdCij + \u03bdPij\n,\n\n(22)\n(23)\n\nwhere I introduce the auxiliary function Cij \u2261 hfi fje i \u2212\nhfi ihfje i. Observe that Pij = Cij = 0 in global equilibrium where the time derivatives vanish. I solve (22)\n\n\f4\nand (23) assuming that Cij initially vanishes and obtain\nh\u03b4pt1 \u03b4pt2 i from (1), (3), and (9). Equation (6) follows,\nbut is exact only if one neglects the time dependence of\n(16) implied by hpt ie \u221d \u03c4 \u2212\u03b3 . For \u03b1 \u226b \u03b3, I approximate\nthis dependence in (6) by taking h\u03b4pt1 \u03b4pt2 ie \u221d \u03c4 \u22122\u03b3 .\nI now fit this transport framework together with my\nearlier assertion that near-equilibrium pt correlations are\ninduced by spatial inhomogeneity, i.e., eq. (11). In the\nrelaxation-time approximation P e is arbitrary, as is f e .\nTo deduce either from transport theory, one must use\n(21) with the full collision term I[fP\n]. Following [15] yields\n\u03bc \u03bd\ne\nP12\n= hf1e ihf2e i\u03b8, where \u03b8 = a12 + \u03bc\u03bd b\u03bc\u03bd\n12 p1 p2 , for a and\n\u03bc\u03bd\nb functions of x1 and x2 . In a uniform system these\ncoefficients are constant, so that (1), (3) and (9) imply\nh\u03b4pt1 \u03b4pt2 i \u2261 0, confirming our intuition. Our physicallymotivated (11) takes \u03b8 \u2248 r(x1 , x2 )/n(x1 )n(x2 ), which is\nadequate for our estimate (16).\nCalculations in figs. 1 and 2 illustrate the common effect of thermalization on one-body and two-body pt observables. Equation (6) together with the computed (7)\nand (13) is in good accord with data. The solid curves in\nall figures are fit to STAR fluctuation data and hpt i data\n(except for N , I ignore any energy dependence). I assume\n\u03b1 = 4 and \u03b3 = 0.15 in central collisions, and parameterize S(M ) by taking \u03b1 \u221d M 1/3 and \u03c4F \u2212 \u03c40 \u221d M 1/2 . In\nthis work it is not necessary to specify whether the equilibrating system is partonic or hadronic. That said, in\nfig. 2 I take the same \u03b1 for all species, as appropriate for\nparton scattering. Measurements of pt fluctuations for\nidentified particles can further test whether thermalization is species independent.\nIn comparing to PHENIX data in fig. 1b, note that the\nmagnitude difference with fig. 1a follows from the different acceptance of STAR and PHENIX. The solid curve\nin fig. 1b agrees with the data within the uncertainty,\nbut the dashed curve shows better agreement for \u03b3 = 0.2\nand \u03c4F \u2212 \u03c40 \u221d M . While agreement with hpt i data for\nthe new parameters is less compelling than fig. 2, results\nstill fall within the uncertainty.\nPreliminary data from refs. [1, 2] and [7, 8] show tantalizing similarity to the calculations. However, experimental uncertainty must be reduced to firmly establish\nthe low multiplicity rise as well as the behavior at high\nmultiplicity. Contributions to hpt i and h\u03b4pt1 \u03b4pt2 i not included in this exploratory work are diffusion, collective\nradial flow, Bose-Einstein (HBT) correlations, and collective hadronization. Collective effects can be important in\ncentral collisions, where the matter evolves after equilibration. Flow can enhance the fluctuations, while diffusion can reduce them. HBT effects can be experimentally\nestimated by cutting on each pair's relative momentum.\nThis contribution is of order 10% at RHIC energy [18]\nbut may be larger at lower energies [3]. While resonance\n\nand hard-scattering contributions to fluctuations are estimated by taking RAA in (7) and (16) from HIJING,\nchemical equilibration may modify the centrality dependence for resonance production, altering h\u03b4pt1 \u03b4pt2 i.\nExperimental indications that nuclear collisions produce matter near local equilibrium are scant and circumstantial. Any experimental evidence of the onset of equilibrium - particularly at the parton level - will validate\nthose indications. Rapidity dependence measurements\ncan distinguish the thermalization effects proposed here\nfrom alternative explanations [11, 12]. Here, the rapidity\ndependence arises from the dependence of (7) and (16)\non RAA , which is itself measurable [9].\nAcknowledgements\n\nI thank C. Pruneau, S. Voloshin, and G.
