The observations have been carried out using the VLA at 8.4 and 15 GHz\nover a period of 197 days. We describe a method to estimate the time delay from the\nobserved light curves. Using this method, our cross-correlation analysis shows that\nthe time delay between images B and A is 1.5\u00b11.4d, between A and C is 7.6\u00b12.5d,\nbetween B and C is 8.2\u00b12.0d. When applied to other lensed systems with measured\ntime delays our new method gives comparable results.\nKey words: gravitational lensing - quasar B1422+231 - time delay\n\n1\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nOne of the most promising outcomes of the study of gravitational lensing is the potential to determine the Hubble\nconstant, H0 , independent of the standard distance ladder\n(Refsdal 1964). The light travel times for the lensed images\nare not equal due to the geometrical path length difference\ncaused by the gravitational potential of the lens. This results in a time delay between the lensed images that can be\nmeasured by monitoring the images over a period of time.\nThus, given a measurement of time delay and a knowledge\nof the gravitational potential of the lens, one can estimate\nH0 . At present, the accuracy of H0 values determined by\nthis method is limited mainly by our knowledge of the mass\ndistribution in the distant lensing galaxy.\nSo far, time-delay measurements are available for seven\nlensed systems. For the twin quasar 0957+561 the measured values at both radio and optical wavelengths are in\nagreement and have been confirmed by observing variability in the image B after it was recorded in the image A\n(Schild & Thomson 1997, Kundi\u0107 et al. 1997b, Haarsma et\nal. 1999). While for this system a reliable measurement of\nthe time delay has been achieved, translation into an estimate of the Hubble constant turns out to be not straightforward (Narasimha, 1999). For the systems PG 1115+080\n(Schechter et al. 1997), B1608+656 (Fassnacht et al. 1999),\nPKS 1830-211 (Lovell et al. 1998), B1600+434 (Koopmans\net al. 2000) the measured delays are less accurate, mainly\nbecause it is not easy to extract the intrinsic variability and\ndetermine its phase lag between the images. The system\nc 0000 RAS\n\nB0218+357 has good time delay measurements (Biggs et al.\n1999) and the redshift combination of the lens and source\nare favourable for a possible determination of H0 , but the\nlens models continue to be ill-constrained. However, these\nsystems together cover various combinations of the distance\nto the source and lens as well as the distance from the lens\nto the source; hence an estimate of the distance scale from\ntime-delays in all these systems together would be an important step to determine the Hubble constant and the large\nscale geometry of the Universe.\nThe lens system B1422+231 is particularly interesting\nin this respect, as the redshift of the source, zS = 3.62,\n(Patnaik et al. 1992) is very large compared to the redshift\nof the lens, zL = 0.33, (Kundi\u0107 et al. 1997a, Tonry 1998)\nand consequently, the time-delay is a more direct measure\nof the distance to the lens. B1422+231 is a quadruple system which has been observed at various wavebands (Patnaik\net al. 1992; Lawrence et al. 1992; Remy et al. 1993; Yee &\nEllingson 1994; Bechtold & Yee 1995; Akujor et al. 1996; Yee\n& Bechtold 1996; Impey et al. 1996). Several models have\nbeen presented to explain the lens system (Hogg & Blandford 1994, Narasimha & Patnaik, 1994, Kormann, Schneider\n& Bartlemann 1994, Mao & Schneider 1998). Detailed radio maps at sub-milliarcsecond resolution are available for\nthe images (Patnaik et al. 1999) and the mapping of the resolved structures of the images can be used for construction\nof the lens models. Optical spectra of the images have been\ntaken with high sensitivity (Impey et al. 1996) and the emission line profiles of strong lines like Ly\u03b1 have been used by\n\n\f2\n\nA.R. Patnaik & D. Narasimha\n\nNarasimha & Srianand (1999) to constrain the lens models.\nThus, it is clear that a measurement of the time-delay for\nthis system will be useful for the calibration of the cosmic\ndistance scale, even though the source is not highly variable.\n\nOBSERVATIONS AND DATA ANALYSIS\n\nThe VLA monitoring campaign of the gravitational lens\nB1422+231 was carried out at two frequencies, 8.4 and\n15 GHz between 1994 March 03 to September 16. We used\ntwo 50 MHz-wide IF bands at each frequency.\nWe used 3C286 (J1331+3030) to calibrate the flux density scale, OQ208 (J1407+2827) as the phase calibrator, and\n3C287 (J1330+2509) as a control source since it is not expected to be a variable source. The other reason for selecting\nthis source is that it is close to the declination of our target\nsource to ensure proper calibration of gain as a function of\nelevation.\nThe observations were carried out for about 30 min on\neach day, the integration time for the target source was 5 min\nat each frequency and the rest of the time was used for observing the calibration and control sources. Accurate calibration is of vital importance in this kind of monitoring\nobservations. The observations of the two calibrators ensure\nthat any variations in them must be due to calibration errors and hence these variations can, at least partially, be\nremoved from the light curve of the lensed images.\nWe chose two different frequencies in order to have confidence in the measurements of time delay as it is independent of frequency, though the variability of quasars does\ndepend on the frequency in the sense that they tend to be\nmore variable at higher frequencies. In the present case, we\nchose 8.4 and 15 GHz for the following reasons. In the A\nconfiguration of the VLA the resolutions are about 0.2 and\n0.13 arcsec at 8.4 and 15 GHz respectively, which allows\nclean separation of the images. In the B configuration, however, the two brighter images, A and B, are blended together\nat 8.4 GHz since the resolution is three times poorer, while\nthere is no such difficulty at 15 GHz. We can sample the\nlight curve over the periods of A and B configurations of\nthe VLA at 15 GHz but only during the A configuration at\n8.4 GHz.\nThe data were calibrated and imaged using the AIPS\nsoftware package of National Radio Astronomy Observatory.\nAssumed flux densities of 3C286 were 5.145 Jy and 5.124 Jy\nat the centre frequencies of the two IF bands which are\n8.4149 GHz and 8.4649 GHz respectively, and 3.449 Jy and\n3.457 Jy at 14.9649 GHz and 14.9149 GHz respectively. Since\n3C286 is partially resolved at these frequencies, we followed\nthe standard procedure in using the shortest baselines to set\nthe scale of flux density.\nWe assumed that both OQ208 and 3C287 are unresolved sources and used them to determine the gain solutions. We then used the AIPS program GETJY to determine the flux densities of these two sources which are bootstrapped from 3C286. The source 3C287 is, in fact, partially\nresolved in the A-array (its flux density changes from 1.4 Jy\nat short spacings to 0.9 Jy at the longest spacing at 15GHz).\nWe could have mapped the source to determine its flux density. However, the assumption that it is a point source affects\nits flux density measurement by only 0.5% (our method gets\n\n01.0\n\nA\n00.8\n\nDECLINATION (J2000)\n\n2\n\n22 56 01.2\n\n00.6\n\nB\n00.4\n00.2\n00.0\n55 59.8\n\nD\n\nC\n\n59.6\n59.4\n14 24 38.18\n\n38.16\n\n38.14\n38.12\n38.10\n38.08\nRIGHT ASCENSION (J2000)\n\n38.06\n\n38.04\n\nFigure 1. 15 GHz map of B1422+231.

Thus the assumption that 3C287 behaves\nas a point source is justified. Moreover, we avoid introducing\nerrors as a result of the mapping process.\nThe VLA configuration was changed from A to B during our monitoring campaign. In fact, the data presented\nfor 8.4 GHz was only for the duration of the A-array. We do\nnot see any effects of the change of the array configuration\nin the light curves of the calibrators at 15GHz, giving confidence in the calibration method followed. We used the gain\nsolutions for the phase calibrator, OQ208, to interpolate the\namplitude and phase corrections for the target source.\nThe observations were scheduled in intervals of between\n2 and 11 days. The measured flux densities are presented in\nTables 1 and 2 for 8.4 and 15 GHz respectively. At 15 GHz\nwe had 51 epochs covering both A and B configurations of\nthe VLA. At 8.4 GHz we had only 18 epochs since its span\nwas limited to the A configuration.\nThe data for B1422+231 was imaged using standard\nprocedure in AIPS. Typical rms noise levels in the maps\nwere about 0.3 mJy/beam at 8.4 GHz and 0.4 mJy/beam\nat 15 GHz. Fig. 1 shows a 15 GHz map of B1422+231 where\nthe images have been labelled. The flux densities were measured from the maps by fitting gaussians to each of the four\nimages using the program JMFIT. We quote the errors in\nflux densities as given by this program. The flux densities\nof the calibrators and of the four lensed images are given in\nTable 1 and these are plotted in Fig.2 (for 8.4 GHz results)\nand Table 2 and Fig. 3 (for 15 GHz results).\nIn what follows we chose not to analyse the results of\n8.4 GHz due to insufficient points in the light curve. We\nconcentrate on the 15 GHz results.\nIt is evident that any correlated variability (at the same\nepoch) in the light curves of calibrators as well as the target\nsources is due to errors in calibration. We, therefore, normalised each of the light curves of the sources by dividing it\nby the flux density of its first epoch. Then we divided these\nnormalised points by the corresponding point of OQ208 from\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fTime delay of B1422+231\nDay\n\n3C287\n\nerror\n\nOQ208\n\nerror\n\nA\n\nerror\n\nB\n\nerror\n\nC\n\nerror\n\nD\n\nerror\n\n0\n1\n11\n15\n18\n21\n25\n28\n31\n36\n38\n40\n46\n51\n53\n58\n63\n68\n\n2.1288\n2.1490\n2.1233\n2.1407\n2.1347\n2.1450\n2.1616\n2.1743\n2.1392\n2.1355\n2.1351\n2.1273\n2.1352\n2.1724\n2.0575\n2.1527\n1.9588\n1.9059\n\n\u00b10.0037\n\u00b10.0041\n\u00b10.0031\n\u00b10.0080\n\u00b10.0087\n\u00b10.0168\n\u00b10.0184\n\u00b10.0204\n\u00b10.0079\n\u00b10.0090\n\u00b10.0073\n\u00b10.0050\n\u00b10.0054\n\u00b10.0047\n\u00b10.0144\n\u00b10.0043\n\u00b10.1552\n\u00b10.1101\n\n1.8110\n1.8104\n1.7412\n1.8119\n1.8069\n1.8175\n1.8463\n1.8335\n1.8070\n1.8066\n1.8020\n1.8211\n1.8197\n1.8260\n1.8130\n1.8227\n1.6580\n1.6057\n\n\u00b10.0041\n\u00b10.0037\n\u00b10.0516\n\u00b10.0072\n\u00b10.0067\n\u00b10.0138\n\u00b10.0165\n\u00b10.0129\n\u00b10.0071\n\u00b10.0058\n\u00b10.0067\n\u00b10.0041\n\u00b10.0047\n\u00b10.0063\n\u00b10.0104\n\u00b10.0067\n\u00b10.1307\n\u00b10.0928\n\n0.1464\n0.1467\n0.1457\n0.1462\n0.1467\n0.1484\n0.1505\n0.1492\n0.1460\n0.1504\n0.1475\n0.1490\n0.1457\n0.1518\n0.1480\n0.1489\n0.1338\n0.1249\n\n\u00b10.0003\n\u00b10.0002\n\u00b10.0005\n\u00b10.0002\n\u00b10.0002\n\u00b10.0002\n\u00b10.0004\n\u00b10.0002\n\u00b10.0002\n\u00b10.0006\n\u00b10.0010\n\u00b10.0003\n\u00b10.0004\n\u00b10.0004\n\u00b10.0004\n\u00b10.0012\n\u00b10.0002\n\u00b10.0014\n\n0.1565\n0.1569\n0.1559\n0.1557\n0.1571\n0.1584\n0.1620\n0.1601\n0.1574\n0.1595\n0.1569\n0.1584\n0.1556\n0.1596\n0.1579\n0.1581\n0.1416\n0.1313\n\n\u00b10.0003\n\u00b10.0002\n\u00b10.0005\n\u00b10.0002\n\u00b10.0002\n\u00b10.0002\n\u00b10.0004\n\u00b10.0002\n\u00b10.0002\n\u00b10.0006\n\u00b10.0010\n\u00b10.0003\n\u00b10.0004\n\u00b10.0004\n\u00b10.0004\n\u00b10.0012\n\u00b10.0002\n\u00b10.0014\n\n0.0803\n0.0802\n0.0804\n0.0804\n0.0795\n0.0817\n0.0813\n0.0819\n0.0799\n0.0811\n0.0803\n0.0814\n0.0797\n0.0822\n0.0800\n0.0821\n0.0724\n0.0652\n\n\u00b10.0003\n\u00b10.0002\n\u00b10.0005\n\u00b10.0002\n\u00b10.0002\n\u00b10.0002\n\u00b10.0004\n\u00b10.0002\n\u00b10.0002\n\u00b10.0006\n\u00b10.0010\n\u00b10.0003\n\u00b10.0004\n\u00b10.0004\n\u00b10.0004\n\u00b10.0012\n\u00b10.0002\n\u00b10.0013\n\n0.0041\n0.0040\n0.0045\n0.0043\n0.0045\n0.0044\n0.0036\n0.0045\n0.0040\n0.0047\n0.0042\n0.0043\n0.0042\n0.0042\n0.0039\n0.0069\n0.0040\n0.0038\n\n\u00b10.0003\n\u00b10.0002\n\u00b10.0005\n\u00b10.0002\n\u00b10.0002\n\u00b10.0002\n\u00b10.0004\n\u00b10.0002\n\u00b10.0002\n\u00b10.0006\n\u00b10.0014\n\u00b10.0003\n\u00b10.0005\n\u00b10.0003\n\u00b10.0004\n\u00b10.0011\n\u00b10.0002\n\u00b10.0015\n\n3\n\nTable 1. Flux densities (in Jy) of the observed sources and their errors at 8.4 GHz. The first column refers to the days starting from\n1994 March 3.\n\nthe light curves of all the sources in order to remove the calibration errors. The rms variation in the light curve of 3C287\nimproved from 2.5% to 1.7% after this division (Fig. 6).\nFigure 4 shows the light curves of A, B and C images of\nB1422+231. Figure 5 shows the light curve of image D. It is\nclear from Fig. 4 that we do detect variability of the three\nbrighter images of B1422+231. Image D is rather weak and\nsuffers from larger uncertainties due to poor signal-to-noise\nratio and hence has correspondingly larger error bars. It is,\ntherefore, not possible to conclude about its variability from\nthe present observations. For the others, we observe peakto-peak variability of about 5% during our observing run of\n197 days.\n\n3\n\nNEW METHOD FOR DETERMINATION OF\nTIME\u2013DELAY\n\nIn the past, the conventional method to cross-correlating\nthe fluxes of the images to determine the time delay between them has not been very successful when the noise at\nthe time period of expected time delay was non-negligible,\neven though the overall signal to noise ratio of the data could\nbe very good. This was apparent in the case of 0957 + 561\nwhere time delay was around 417 days while some of the\nmicrolens events had similar duration (Schild & Thomson\n1997, Kundi\u0107 et al. 1997b, Haarsma et al. 1999). This problem is severe for B1422+231 due to the low amplitude of\nvariability in radio.\nOur method is based on identifying a single component of the intrinsic variability and using this component\nto cross correlate between the images (cf. Narasimha 2000).\nIn the conventional methods, attempts are usually made to\ncross\u2013correlate all the frequencies of variability simultaneously, and hence the method is most sensitive to the highest\nfrequency. Unfortunately, the variability in the data at the\nhighest frequency is the noise. We attempt to derive an alternative approach, in which, essentially one single frequency\nis analysed and the noise in the phase of this component\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\nis minimised before the feature is used for cross\u2013correlation\nbetween the images. A smoothed cubic spline is used for the\nidentification of the feature. We do not use any specific form\nfor the variability, but in view of its application for many\nsimilar systems we shall illustrate and explain the general\nmethod through an ideal example where the term phase difference is easily understood.\nLet the smooth component of flux obtained from the\nobserved sample be represented by a function of the form,\nf\u03bd (t) = fo + Asin \u03c9 t \u2212 t\u2032 + \u03c6\n\n\u0002\n\n\u0001\n\n\u0003\n\nHere fo is the steady flux, A is the amplitude of variability,\n\u03c9 is the frequency of intrinsic variability of the signal of\ninterest and the crucial term required for computation of the\ntime delay is the observed phase factor \u03c6 for the different\nimages.\nIf the external noises were absent and the sampling were\nsufficiently good, the flux would be\nF\u03bd (t) = Fo + \u03b1sin \u03c9o t \u2212 t\u2032 + \u03c6o\n\n\u0001\n\n\u0002\n\n\u0003\n\nWe assume that \u03b1, \u03c9o and \u03c6o are close to the observed sample values A, \u03c9 and \u03c6 respectively. Then, a Taylor expansion\nfor the sample values about the population mean is valid.\nCarrying out a \u03c72 minimisation we can obtain four linear relations for the four unknowns. If the observations span one\ncycle of variability or more, the mean values for terms like\nsin(\u03c9t+\u03c6), cos(\u03c9t+\u03c6) summed over the observed epochs will\ntend to zero. Consequently, we can select a value of t\u2032 close\nto the mean epoch of the observation such that the computed sample values of A, \u03c9, f\u03bd and \u03c6 will be stochastically\nindependent. The variance of \u03c6 can, then, be approximated\nby\n\nV ariance(\u03c6) = 2/\n\nX (f\u03bd,i \u2212 f \u0304\u03bd )2\ni\n\n\u03c3i2\n\n\fA.R. Patnaik & D.

2. Flux densities (in Jy) of the observed sources and their errors at 15 GHz. The first column refers to the days starting from\n1994 March 3. The last column gives the elevation of B1422+231 in degrees. The flux densities of the two calibrators, 3C287 and OQ208\nwere determined from the program GETJY while that of lensed images were determined by fitting a gaussian to the image.\n\nThe time-delay between the images can be estimated\nfrom the cross-correlation between the variable part of the\nfluxes obtained from the smoothed cubic splines. The cross\ncorrelation will have the form\nR = cos (\u03c9\u03c4 + \u03c61 \u2212 \u03c62 ) ,\nwhere \u03c4 is the assumed time delay between the images. The\nphase factors \u03c61 and \u03c62 refer to the variable components of\nthe smoothed cubic spline fits to the observed fluxes in the\nimages 1 and 2. The errors in the data points are contributed\nalmost entirely by the calibration source and the steady part\nof the signal. The time period over which the source is monitored is very long compared to the time\u2013delay. Consequently,\n\nthe variance in R can be approximated, to a good extent,\nby the product of the variance of the normalised flux of the\ntwo images. As we described earlier, since we are interested\nonly in the phase factor of the variable component of the\nfluxes, the errors in the normalised smoothed flux represent\nthe errors in the computed phase factor. The variance is an\nindicator of the expected error in the computed flux and\nhence, the estimated time\u2013delays. If the smoothed flux has\nexactly the same form in the images, the correlation will\nhave a peak value of unity, but in practice it will be less\nwhen the fitting is done independently. In view of the form\nof the expression for R, the error in the computed time delay\nis the time interval over which the correlation, R, drops by\n\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fTime delay of B1422+231\n\n5\n\nFigure 2.

It is reasonable to assume that the observations lasted\nfor one cycle of variation. For the 8.4 GHz, the observations\nlasted for less than seventy days, number of epochs were\nless. Consequently, we are not able to carry out the analysis\ndiscussed here. Hence our time\u2013delay analysis is restricted\nto the 15 GHz data.\nThe variances of \u03c6 for the images B, A and C are at\n0.013 level which is equivalent to 4 days (variance of 0.01\nis equivalent to an error of 0.1 radian, and as the period\nis about 216 days, this amounts to about 4 days). This is\na consequence of the time interval between the observations\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\nbeing at 2 to 11 days. Since the time intervals between observations are not fixed, we are able to separate a time\u2013delay\nof less than the minimum time interval between the successive observations. But our computed error is rather high\nwhich shows that with a better sampling of the observations\nwe should be able to get time\u2013delays for all the images. In\npractice, the uncertainty in the relative fluxes of the images\nis mainly due to the day to day calibration error rather than\nthe relative flux of the images with respect to the calibrator.\nHence, strictly, the stochastic independence of the data cannot be claimed. Nevertheless, we treat the normalised fluxes\nof images to be stochastically independent. This results in\nhigher error estimate.\nHowever, for the image D, the error in individual observations is considerable due to the faintness of the image.\nConsequently, the estimated variance of the phase is around\n7, corresponding to an uncertainty of over 150 degrees, implying that the relative phase of image D with respect to\nother images cannot be estimated from the given sample. So,\nwe have not carried out any analysis for this image, in spite\nof its significance for cosmological purposes. The derived\n\n\f6\n\nA.R. Patnaik & D. Narasimha\n\nFigure 3. Light curves of the observed sources at 15 GHz. Source name is indicated at the respective panel.\n\ntime delays between images B and A is 1.5\u00b11.4d, between\nA and C is 7.6\u00b12.5d and between B and C is 8.2\u00b12.0d.\nWhen is this method superior to direct estimation of\nthe time delay? If the smoothed cubic spline can isolate a\nsingle component of the intrinsic flux variability from the\nmean flux of the images, and any contribution due to microlensing is filtered from the smooth function, then the signal\nin the correlation will improve compared to the noise by a\nfactor of (n-4), where n is the number of epochs of observation and the number 4 is based on the minimum number of\ndata points required for the computations of the smoothed\nspline. In practice, the errors between the various images\nare not independent because as in the case of our data for\nB1422+231, the main contribution to error in the smoothed\nfit is from the calibrating sources which are common to all\nthe images. Consequently, our error estimate is probably\nconservative; the time delays could be closer to our estimations than the error bars suggest. This can be seen also from\nthe fact that the sum of the time delays between images BA\nand between AC agrees well with that of BC.\n\n5\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nThe time delays between the images A, B and C have been\ndetermined, though not very accurately. However, the monitoring of the weaker image D has not been successful mainly\nbecause the fractional errors in the flux densities were considerably larger than the amplitude of the intrinsic variability. For the distance estimate, the time delay between image\nD and other images is important because it is a measure\nof the lens mass. Hence our results, so far, do not provide\nany reliable distance determination. It would be necessary\nto carry out monitoring for a longer time with considerably\nbetter precision in order to estimate the time delay between\nimage D and the brighter images.\nThe models of Narasimha & Patnaik (1993) predicted a\nvalue of time delay between images A and C of the order of\n9 days for a distance to the lens of 1000 Mpc (signal appearing in C first), assuming a single component lens and H0 to\nbe 50 km s \u22121 Mpc\u22121 . Our measurement of AC time delay\nof 7.6\u00b12.5d implies a Hubble constant in the range of 64 to\n75 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 for the standard cosmology, with only a\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fTime delay of B1422+231\n\n7\n\nNormalised light curve of 3C287 at 15GHz\n1.04\n\nNormailised flux density\n\n1.02\n\n1\n\n0.98\n\n0.96\n\n0.94\n\n0\n\n50\n\n100\nDays since 1994 March 3\n\n150\n\n200\n\nFigure 6.

(1999).\n\na weak group of galaxies near the main lens, the result is\nexpected to be in between the two limits discussed above.\nHowever, a natural question to address is that whether\nthe method suggested here is reliable and has advantages\nover the conventional data analysis techniques. We shall\nbriefly address these questions by showing our results and\nsome comments for the three systems, namely, B1608+656,\nB0218+357 and PG1115+080, for which time delays have\nbeen available during the last few years, but the data are\nstill not good compared to 0957+561.\n\n6\n\nVARIABILITY AND TIME\u2013DELAY IN\nOTHER LENS SYSTEMS\n\nWe have analysed the available data for the systems\nB1608+656 (Fassnacht et al., 1999), B0218+357 (Biggs\net al., 1999) and PG1115+080 (Schechter et al., 1997). We\nhave displayed one typical diagram for the time delay based\non polarization angles in the system B0218+357 (Fig. 8) and\na summary of the results for the three systems is given in\nTable 3.\nThe data for B1608+656 are very good, in spite of low\namplitude of the variability and multi-component fluctuations. The excellent calibration based on stable reference\nsource and elimination of the questionable data make the\nderived time delay reliable. Our results for the three combination of the time delays (AB, BC and BD) are in good\nagreement with the value derived by the observers' team,\nand the value for AB is very close to the differential time\ndelay BC-AC. However, it would be worth pointing out\nthat the smoothed spline cross\u2013correlation peaks at much\nlower than 1, which indicates that there could be considerable amount of noise introduced en route in all the images.\nPossibly multi-frequency observations and polarization data\nwould be required to assess the nature of this noise.\nFor the system B0218+357, at the higher frequency,\n\n0.9\n\n0.8\n\n0.7\n\n0.6\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\nTime delay in days\n\nFigure 9. Cross-correlation function for the light curve of\nB0218+357. Solid line represents the correlation function for the\ntotal intensity, long dashed curve represents that for the position angle of polarization, and small dashed curve represents that\nfor the fractional polarization of B0218+357 at 15GHz. Data are\ntaken from Biggs et al. (1999).\n\nall the three methods, namely, total flux, polarization fraction and the the polarization angle give nearly identical results (Fig. 9 and Table 3), all in agreement with the values\ngiven by the observers' team. The polarization angle appears to have the highest correlation between the images in\nour method. We think that polarization angle is among the\nmost trustworthy indicators of the intrinsic variability, as\npointed out by Nair et al. (1993) and Nair (1994).\nFor the system PG1115+080, again, our results are\nbroadly in agreement with Schechter et al. (1997). However,\na few comments are worth mentioning. First, the time delay\nbetween images B and C are generally stable against analysis\ntechnique or some amount of noise in the data. But the time\u2013\ndelay between the merging image A and the other two are\nsensitive to the method adopted as well as the noise in the\nreference star. Second, for the whole data, our time\u2013delay\nbetween images B and C is slightly smaller than the value\ngiven by Schechter et al. But if we drop two days on which\nthe fluctuation in the magnitude of the reference star was\ncomparable to the amplitude of variability of the quasar, the\ntime\u2013delay becomes 24.4 days, which is exactly in between\nthe values derived by Schechter et al. and Barkana (1997).\nThird, our value for the time delay between images A and\nB range from 6 to 11 days, depending on using or dropping\nthe data for the two days. The corresponding value for the\ntime\u2013delay between images C and A vary between 14 and 13\ndays. Consequently, our time\u2013delay ratio between CA and\nAB are always consistent with the lens models; the small ratio supports a compact lens and higher value for the Hubble\nconstant while the larger ratio favours an extended lens and\nsmaller Hubble constant.\n\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fTime delay of B1422+231\n\n9\n\nTable 3.

The light curves were sampled at intervals\nof 2 to 10 days only because we did not have a good idea of\nthe amplitude of intrinsic variability and were interested in\nthe image D in view of its importance for cosmological distance calibration. Consequently, we are unable to get very\naccurate value for the time delay between images. But we\nare able to determine the time delay between the bright images using the 15 GHz observations, obtaining 1.5, 7.6 and\n8.2 days for AB, CA and CB time delays respectively. More\nextensive monitoring at significantly higher signal to noise\nratio is necessary to determine the time delay between the\nweak image D and the other images.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe would like to thank J.
