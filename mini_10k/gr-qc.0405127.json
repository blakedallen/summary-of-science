Even if completely absent in loop quantum gravity [1], classical\nsingularities would correspond to regions of high curvature and nakedness would imply their exposure to asymptotic observers. This itself could lead to observational\nsignatures of particle creation and such effects [2].\nSecondly, there appears to be a contrast in the semiclassical behaviour of black\nholes and naked singularities. That contrast could be carried through into the quantum\ngravity domain. This has been clearly brought out in the dust collapse case [2]. The\ncovered singularity evaporates leaving behind about a Planck mass before reaching the\nquantum gravity domain. However, when the initial data corresponds classically to\nnaked singularities, most of the star collapses almost intact into the quantum gravity\ndomain all through the semiclassical phase . The star stays almost classical directly\ntill the quantum gravity stage. Moreover, this happens well within the lifetime of the\nUniverse [2]. The naked singular solution is thus special from the physical point of\nview. This argument is subject to the assumption that the behaviour in the dust case\nis typical of the general scenario.\nOut of these, we focus on the second aspect in this paper. Although a contrast\nin behaviour may still occur, the analysis of dust collapse does not warrant to be\nconsidered as typical as suggested in [2]. The behaviour of dust depends not only\non the semiclassical phase but also on the onset of the quantum gravity domain as\nwell as backreaction considerations. In the spherical dust case, the quantum gravity\ndomain is reached at some stage before the formation of the Cauchy horizon [2] and\nthe backreaction is found to be negligible.\nThe behaviour above need not always be the case. To this end, we show that the\nReissner Nordstrom metric (charge denoted by E and mass by M ) E < M case is an\nexception. Before proceeding on that, we first point out that the Reissner Nordstr\u00f6m\nmetric can be presented in co-ordinates which mimic dynamical evolution. As far as we\nare aware, this has not been done previously. This leads us to two important technical\nfacts. Firstly, one can work with Hadamard states, in principle requiring specification\nonly on the initial Cauchy surface. This justifies the global validitity of Wald axioms\nfor the quantum stress tensor which will be assumed in this work. Secondly, we can\neasily imagine the metric to result from initial data since we have explicit dynamical\nco-ordinates. This qualifies the metric to be considered as a collapse leading to a\nsingularity (curvature singularity). The case E < M can be obtained from non-singular\ninitial data. We then calculate the quantum stress tensor for massless scalar fields on\nthis background and recover the divergence of the quantum stress tensor on the Cauchy\nhorizon obtained earlier [3]. It should be noted that the global validity of Wald axioms\nis essential in this and similar results concerning the quantum stress tensor. This has\nnot been justified in previous work on Reissner Nordstrom metric.\nIt should be noted that the Reissner Nordstr\u00f6m solution is likely to be more of an\nidealized situation. A realistic collapse would perhaps be accompanied by a radiative\ninflux. Perturbations of the solution are therefore extensively studied especially for instability of Cauchy horizon [4] [5] [6] [7]. Several issues arise therefrom. Some, like the\ninflation of the mass function, suggest a non local characterization of the Cauchy hori-\n\n2\n\n\fzon in special models. Others admit observer dependence of divergences. The premise\nfor our theme necessitates consideration of only local quantities, the divergences of\nwhich are observer independent. We wish to address the issues in the simplest of cases\nand present the Reissner Nordstr\u00f6m solution as one.\nThough we consider the evolution for initial data corresponding to the Reissner\nNordstr\u00f6m solution, the result is useful in so far as concerns of a general possibility of\nan energy burst near Cauchy horizons. In general, one needs to account for backreaction and invoke quantum gravity to check this. In this example, the E < M initial\nconfiguration radiates away right upto the Cauchy horizon. The quantum gravity limit\ndoes not occur before the horizon. This is unlike the dust case scenario (suggested to\nbe generally valid within spherical symmetry) wherein the quantum gravity domain\nsets in earlier.\nWe thus wish to point out that the interplay between physical limits needs to be considered carefully, even within general spherical symmetry. The counterexample of initial\ndata that appears as this simple case, warrants further investigation into the issue.\nApart from this theme , we note that our result for our example does not strengthen\nthe case for a burst because of backreaction. Also, there is a similarity with dust\ncollapse in our example. We find that the configuration does stay intact till it is very\nclose to the Cauchy horizon.\n\n2\n\nQuantum Stress Tensor and choice of state\n\nMuch of the physics of quantum fields in curved spacetime is captured by a local\nquantity, the quantum stress tensor. See for instance the chapter 6 of [8] (The central\nproblem). After several approaches to regularize and renormalize this quantity, R. M.\nWald came up with four axioms which restricted the form of the quantum stress tensor\nto a very large extent [9].\nFrom Wald axioms and the trace anomaly in 2-d, one can show that the quantum\nstress tensor is of the form\n\n< Tuu > = C (1/C),u,u + AA(u)\n\n(1)\n\n< Tvv > = C (1/C),v,v + BB(v)\n\n(2)\n\n< Tuv > = R/24\u03c0\n\n(3)\n\nwhere the line element is expressed in double null co-ordinates as ds2 = C 2 dudv\nand R is the scalar curvature of the background spacetime. The information about\nthe state is contained in AA and BB. It can be easily argued based on asymptotic\nbehaviour of < T\u03bc\u03bd > that AA and BB are finite in their domain of definition [3].\nThe important assumption here is that the Wald axioms, especially the conservation of the stress tensor, hold all over the spacetime. Physically, one would like\nto ensure that only by specifying initial conditions near a Cauchy surface, expecting\nthe equations to hold all through the evolution. Indeed this is possible if one chooses\nHadamard states. For a definition and related mathematical development see [10] and\n[11]. These states can be defined using the singularity structure of the two point function. They have two useful properties a) that they satisfy Wald axioms if they stay\nHadamard and b) by choosing the singularity structure near a Cauchy surface, one is\n\n3\n\n\fessentially guaranteed that the Hadamard form is preserved all throughout the Cauchy\ndevelopment [12].\nIn our example, the choice of state is automatically contained in the choice of the\nAA and BB. Certainly, there would be choices corresponding to Hadamard states and\nthat poses no conceptual difficulty. However, property b) requires careful attention\nsince it would restrict considerations to Cauchy developments only. In particular,\nif the spacetime or region of spacetime under consideration is realized as a Cauchy\ndevelopment then we can assume properties a) and b), and thereby we can be assured\nof the formulae equations (1) to hold all over the region.\nWe show that the Reissner Nordstr\u00f6m solution can be explicitly realized as a time\nevolution of initial data justifying our use of Wald axioms in a global sense. In fact we\nshow that we can re-cast the metric in co-ordinates such that the evolution becomes\nexplicit.\n\n3 Reissner Nordstr\u00f6m solution using special coordinates\nWe develop the first part of the analysis in this section, wherein we re-cast the general\nReissner Nordstr\u00f6m solution. However, for further analysis, only E < M is suitable.\nWe consider the field equations for spherical symmetry. In the first subsection, we\nmake certain assumptions on the radial pressure and on the gravitational potential.\nWe show in the next subsection, that further choice recovers the Reissner Nordstr\u00f6m\nmetric. This enables us to cast the metric in a form similar to dynamical evolution.\nThis has been done for the Schwarzschild metric [13]. In the following subsection we\nshow that the condition for nakedness is indeed E 2 > M 2 .

These are similar to but more general\nthan those in [14].

In order to obtain\na solution for R in terms of t and r, we choose A(r) = A(r) = 1 with 2mo (r) = 2M\nand B(R) = \u2212RP (R) + R \u2212 2M . Using this in equation (15) we obtain\nr\u2212t=\n\nZ\n\n1 \u2212 g(R)2\ndR\nP (R)g(R)\n\n(21)\n\nThe Reissner Nordstr\u00f6m metric can now be re-cast as\nds2 =\n\nP (R)\ng(R)2 P (R) 2\n2\ndt\n\u2212\ndr \u2212 R2 d\u03a92\n1 \u2212 g(R)2\n1 \u2212 g(R)2\n\n(22)\n\nWe can choose the function g to be a constant go with the condition 1 \u2212 g02 > 0\nneeded (P > 0 for R > R+ ). In case P becomes negative (which it does when E \u2264 M\nbetween the roots R\u2212 and R+ ), we choose g as follows. For the region R \u2265 R+ + \u01eb, we\nchoose g(R) = g0 . For R+ + \u01eb \u2265 R \u2265 R+ \u2212 \u01eb we choose g to be a C \u221e function ( C \u221e\nat the endpoints of the interval also).

For R+ \u2212 \u01eb \u2265 R, we choose g to be a constant g1 > 1.\nAdditionally, we need to set \u1e58 < 0 to mimic a collapse scenario. This needs g > 0.\nThe solution of (21) can now be obtained explicitly (R \u2265 R+ + \u01eb) .\n\"\n\n#\n\n(2M )2 \u2212 2E 2\n1 \u2212 go2\nR + 2M/2ln(R2 \u2212 2M R + E 2 ) +\nH(R)\nr\u2212t=\ngo\n2\n\n(23)\n\nwhere H is defined as\n\n2\n\n2 \u22121/2\n\nH(R) = (E \u2212 M )\n\niff E 2 > M 2\n\u22121\n\nH(R) = (M \u2212 R)\n\n\u0012\n\ntan\n\n\u22121\n\n\u2212M\nR\u2212M\n) \u2212 tan\u22121 ( 2\n( 2\n2\n1/2\n(E \u2212 M )\n(E \u2212 M 2 )1/2\n\n\u0013\n\n(24)\n\nR/M\n\niff E 2 = M 2\nH(R) = 1/2(M 2 \u2212 E 2 )\u22121/2 ln\niff E 2 < M 2\n\n(25)\n1\u2212\n1\u2212\n\n\u221aR\nM + M 2 \u2212E 2\n\u221aR\nM \u2212 M 2 \u2212E 2\n\n(26)\n\nFor R \u2264 R+ \u2212 \u01eb (which would be needed in the sections further), we simply replace\ng0 in (23) by g1 .\n\n6\n\n\fFor R < R\u2212 , the case we would need for leading order behaviour of r \u2212 t in terms\nof R, we note that 1 \u2212 g2 > 0 (as P is positive again). It is not difficult to see that this\nbehaviour of r \u2212 t in terms of R is cubic. One can check explicitly that the coefficients\nof the linear and quadratic terms in R cancel out in the equation ( similar to 23 at the\nleading order) and one obtains the following\nr\u2212t=\n\n1 \u2212 g(0)2\nKR3\ng(0)\n\n(27)\n\nwhere\n1\n3E 2\niff E 2 > M 2\n\u22121\nK =\n3E 2\niff E 2\" = M 2\n#\n3E 2\nM2\nM2\n11 \u2212 12 2 \u2212\nK =\n3E 4\nE\n2M 2\nK =\n\niff E 2 < M 2\n\n(28)\n\nThus K and therefore r \u2212 t, is positive only for the case E 2 > M 2 . It is this leading\norder behaviour that is important for further analysis.\nThe behaviour of the right side of equation (23) can be easily checked to be\nmonotonous. Thus, R = 0 curve is the locus t \u2212 r = 0. It is also easily checked\nthat the Kretschmann scalar diverges when R = 0. Thus, the singularity occurs when\nt \u2212 r = 0. Also, the central singularity forms at (t = 0, r = 0).\nUsing the monotonicity and the leading order behaviour (27), we note that in the\ncase E < M , the singularity is absent for all t < 0 at r = 0. We begin with an initial\nsurface t = tin . The initial data evolves from there to form the singularity.\nThus we have cast the case E < M in a manner which enables us to compare with\nspherical dust collapse.\nThe E > M case can also be addressed similarly. In this case, one cannot have\nt < 0 at all for r = 0. Thus the surfaces of constant t begin from t = 0 and thus include\nthe singularity from the beginning.\n\n3.3\n\nNakedness of Reissner Nordstr\u00f6m Solution\n\nAt this juncture it is easily possible to demonstrate that the singularity is locally naked.\nIt is done in a manner equivalent to [15].\nCasting the metric into the usual double null form,\nds2 = P (R)dudv + R2 d\u03a92\n\n(29)\n\nwe find dR/dv along u = constant rays (outgoing rays). It is easy to see that\nP (R)\ndR\n=\ndv\n2\n\n(30)\n\n7\n\n\fEvaluating this as R \u2192 0, we find that it diverges positively independent of E and M .\nThus Reissner Nordstr\u00f6m singularity is always locally naked.\nIt is useful to cast the initial conditions in terms of pr and 2m instead of E and M .\nE 2 = R(tin , r)4 pr (tin , r)\n\n(31)\n\n2M = 2m(tin , r) \u2212 R(tin , r)3 pr (tin , r)\n\n(32)\n\nand\n\nThus depending on how 2m(tin , r) the initial mass (at any r) compares\nwith the rap\ndial pressure dependent quantity R(tin , r)3 pr (tin , r) + 2R(tin , r)2 pr (tin , r), one has\neventually either a naked or a covered singularity.\nFurther, we examine the nature of initial data for regularity. We need to consider\nthe behaviour of R(tin , r), for this purpose. We use equation (27) and the monotonicity\nof the right side of (23). In the case E \u2264 M , R(tin , r) does not vanish at any r and\nhence pr as well as \u03c1 do not diverge anywhere on the initial Cauchy surface. The\nsame is not true however in the case E > M . We know that the singularity is met\nby all Cauchy surfaces as pointed out in the previous section. R(tin , r) vanishes at\n(t = 0, r = 0). Using (27) and (23), we find that R(tin , r) vanishes at points on each\nsurface of constant positive t. Since the surfaces begin from t = 0 with increasing t, pr\nas well as \u03c1 diverge at a point on the surface t = 0 considered as initial ( and on the\nsubsequent surfaces also).\nR<R\u2212\nR=0\nR=R\u2212\nCauchy\nHorizon\n(t=0,r=0)\n\nR+>R>R\u2212\n\nR>R+\nR=const\n\nR=R+\n\nREGION I\ni0\n\nFigure 1: Penrose diagram for Reissner Nordstr\u00f6m case E < M, showing a Cauchysurface\nacross Region I.\nThe singularity develops eventually and a Cauchy horizon forms.\n\n8\n\n\f4 Quantum Stress Tensor for Reissner Nordstr\u00f6m solution\nWe now obtain the quantum stress tensor for the Reissner Nordstr\u00f6m case E < M .\nIt should be noted here that we employ the Wald axioms all over the region - when\nactually, we only demand that one begins with a state of the Hadamard form near\nthe initial Cauchy surface. This supports the suggestion that the divergence on the\nCauchy horizon we obtain is not an artefact of assumptions on the quantum stress\ntensor prescription or on the state, made locally. One could certainly work out the\nsame expressions using the standard co-ordinates as done by Hiscock, under local\nvalidity of Wald axioms. Nevertheless, we use the co-ordinate system in the previous\nsection. Thus, we work explicitly with co-ordinates covering the Cauchy development\nand implicitly require the assumption Hadamard property only on the initial Cauchy\nsurface.\nWe begin with the explicit expression of the line element in the (t,r) co-ordinates\ni.e. in the form (22).\nds2 =\n\ng 2 (R)P (R) 2\nP (R)\n2\ndt\n\u2212\ndr \u2212 R2 d\u03a92\n1 \u2212 g2 (R)\n1 \u2212 g2 (R)\n\n(33)\n\nwhere\nP (R) = 1 \u2212 2M/R + E 2 /R2\n\n(34)\n\nSince we investigate regions near the Cauchy horizon R = R\u2212 , we use the fact that\ng = g1 . We suppress the angular part and obtain the expressions for the quantum\nstress tensor using the results (1) mentioned earlier. We cast the resulting 2-d metric\nin the double null form\nds2 = C 2 (u, v)dudv\n\n(35)\n\nwhere u = t \u2212 g1 r, v = t + g1 r and\nC 2 (u, v) = P (R)/(1 \u2212 g12 )\n\n(36)\n\nThe expressions for the quantum stress tensor can be easily worked out using (1).\n< Tuu > = \u22121/12\u03c0\n\n\u0012\n\ng1 + 1/2\ng12 \u2212 1\n\n< Tvv > = \u22121/12\u03c0\n\n\u0012\n\ng1 \u2212 1/2\ng12 \u2212 1\n\n< Tuv > = R/24\u03c0\n\n\u00132 h\n\ni\n\n(37)\n\ni\n\n(38)\n\nP \u20322 /4 \u2212 P P \u2032\u2032 /2 + AA(u)\n\n\u00132 h\n\nP \u20322 /4 \u2212 P P \u2032\u2032 /2 + BB(v)\n\n(39)\n\nwhere ' denotes derivative with respect to R and R is the Ricci scalar.\nHere, the functions AA and BB from (1) are chosen to be finite like in [3]. We\nare guaranteed that they stay finite once we choose them on a spacelike surface, in\nparticular, the initial Cauchy surface. This is shown using a simple argument. We\npresent that below.\nSince the state is chosen to be Hadamard near the initial Cauchy surface, the Wald\naxioms yield finite expressions for the quantum stress tensor [8]. Then, using equation\n\n9\n\n\f(37) evaluated near the initial surface, it can be easily checked that the functions AA\nand BB have to be finite there. The initial Cauchy surface is t = tin . Note that u and\nv depend only on t and r. Specifying any function of u on this initial surface would\namount to specifying it completely. Similarly with any function of v. This completes\nthe argument.\nReturning to equation 37, we would need to examine behaviour of P . Real roots of\nP (R) = 0 exist when E \u2264 M . It should also be noted that the metric C 2 diverges when\nR = R\u2212 , the Cauchy horizon. The null co-ordinates need to be suitably transformed\nso as to ensure the regularity of the metric on the Cauchy horizon.3 We then calculate\nthe stress tensor using these co-ordinates.\nWe perform the following co-ordinate transformation which ensures regularity of\nthe metric.\nW = W0 exp(\u2212\u03c4 u)\n\n(40)\n\nZ = Z0 exp(\u03c4 v)\n\n(41)\n\nwhere \u03c4 is any positive constant having physical dimension of inverse length and W0\nand Z0 are constants of physical dimension length.\nOne then transforms all tensors to the (W,Z) co-ordinate system.\nOne can check that the metric remains non-zero and finite across the Cauchy horizon.\ngW Z\n\n2\n2\u03c4 R\u2212\nR+ \u2212 R\u2212\nexp\n= 2\n2\n\u03c4 W0 Z0 R\u2212\nR+ \u2212 R\u2212\n\n!\n\n+ O(R \u2212 R\u2212 )\n\n(42)\n\nThe < TW W > component can be easily seen to diverge positively, with the leading\norder behaviour R12 . One can also check this explicitly by transforming < Tuu > to\n< TW W >. In terms of W the divergence is W1 2 to the leading order in the approach\nto the Cauchy horizon. Similar behaviour is reported in the spherical dust case [16].\n\n5 Semiclassical Radiation in Reissner Nordstr\u00f6m\nspacetime\nWe now consider the validity of the semiclassical approximation in the context of\nReissner Nordstr\u00f6m background. If the semiclassical picture were to be followed right\nupto the Cauchy horizon in the Reissner Nordstr\u00f6m background, the results would\nsuggest an intense particle creation accompanying the naked singularity leading to a\nburst of energy on the Cauchy horizon. This behaviour is similar to dust as pointed out\nin the previous section. The semiclassical picture however can be taken to be physically\nappropriate only upto a limit, beyond which quantum gravity has to be invoked. At\nthe same time, backreaction effects must also be considered. We address these issues\nin the Reissner Nordstr\u00f6m case and compare with dust. The quantum gravity limit is\nworked out by assuming it to be reached when curvature scales (of the central region\nof the dust cloud considered) reach the Planck scale [2]. This happens to occur one\n3\n\nThis is similar to the issue of introducing Kruskal co-ordinates for the Schwarzschild metric to ensure\nregularity at the event horizon. See also [3], [16]\n\n10\n\n\fPlanck length before the Cauchy horizon forms in the dust case. The Planck length\ncutoff is crucial for further physical interpretation for the dust case. For instance, if the\ncut off had occured much closer to the Cauchy horizon, the semiclassical calculation,\nwhich indicates the occurence of a burst, would have been well within acceptable range\nof applicability (assuming that backreaction had remained negligible).\nThis crucial feature is clearly brought out in the Reissner Nordstrom case.\nWe first show a key feature which concerns boundedness of curvature in the E < M\ncase. From equation (6), putting in the assumptions about B, A and 2m0 , we find that\nthe density is given by\n8\u03c0\u03c1 =\n\nE2\nR4\n\n(43)\n\nand the radial pressure is given by\n8\u03c0pr =\n\nE2\nR4\n\n(44)\n\nAs is expected, both diverge as the central singularity (t = 0, r = 0) is approached.\nPlanck scale values are reached when t \u223c \u2212tP lanck where tP lanck is the Planck time.\nThe curvatures grow unboundedly as R decreases to 0. This would happen only after\nthe curve R = R\u2212 is crossed. That being the Cauchy horizon, one infers that the\ncurvatures are bounded within the Cauchy development. This boundedness within\nthe full Cauchy development is the key feature which makes this example special. We\nwere able to show it explicitly by casting the region of interest in suitable co-ordinates\nenabling easier identification of the full Cauchy development in the problem.\nOne important consequence of this is that curvatures do not reach Planck scales in\ngeneral before the Cauchy horizon. In particular, it is guaranteed if one chooses R\u2212\nto be much larger than the Planck length scale. Thus, we make a distinction between\nPlanck curvature limit and Planck length cutoff. The latter is simply a null surface\nemerging out of an event one Planck length before the central singularity forms. We\nstudy the semiclassical behaviour upto the Planck length cutoff which we find similar\nto the dust case.\nIn order to find the total energy E emitted to I + , one needs to integrate the power\nradiated upto the Planck length cutoff. We choose \u03c4 and W0 such that gW Z tends to\nunity as R \u2192 \u221e.\nE=\n\nZ\n\nt2P lanck\n\nP (W )dW\n\n(45)\n\n\u221e\n\nwhere P is the power which turns out to be < TW W >. At this stage one can work\nin the full 4-d picture also but needs to resort to geometrical optics approximation for\ncalculating the expression for P . We describe that here. Following [17] we express the\nradiated power4 as\nh\u0304\nP (W ) =\n48\u03c0\n\nG||\nG|\n\n!2\n\n(46)\n\nwhere | denotes derivative with respect to the argument. G is determined by the\ncentre r = 0 being cast as the locus v = G(W ). This result is valid for all spherically\n4\n\nAssuming a conformally coupled field\n\n11\n\n\fsymmetric backgrounds as the derivation involves modes passing through the centre\nirrespective of singularity formation at a later stage.\nIt can be easily checked from this definition that\n1\nG(W ) = \u2212 ln W/W0\n\u03c4\n\n(47)\n\nThe expression for energy radiated is thus obtained as\nE=\n\nh\u0304\n48\u03c0W\n\n(48)\n\nIf W is limited to one Planck time before the Cauchy horizon at I + , then E can be\nseen to be of the order of the Planck mass.\nThis suggests that the data leading to a naked singularity does indeed stay largely\nclassical till it reaches very near the Cauchy horizon. Nevertheless, a burst does occur\nbeyond about a Planck length. In order to rule out such a burst on physical grounds,\nwe cannot invoke the Planck curvature limit like in the dust case.\nThe issue of backreaction sheds light on this matter and the result is the other\nimportant consequence of the key feature of boundedness of curvature in the Reissner\nNordstrom case.\nWe briefly recount the analysis for dust [18]. The energy density < T\u03bc\u03bd > u\u03bc u\u03bd\nas seen by a co-moving observer moving with four velocity u\u03bc , represents the energy\ndensity associated with quantum fields. The classical background density is then compared with this. The background density grows unboundedly as the central singularity\nis approached. Especially near the centre, the background density is larger than the\nenergy density of the scalar field, till the central singularity forms. This indicates that\nthe backreaction is insignificant during the semiclassical evolution.\nThe situation is different in the Reissner Nordstrom case. The quantum stress tensor\ngrows unboundedly while the background density (43) and pressure (44) remain finite\n. It is thus impossible for the background curvatures to dominate over the quantum\nfield energies at any event before the Cauchy horizon. It therefore turns out that\nthe Reissner Nordstrom metric would be unsuitable as a background near the Cauchy\nhorizon under considerations of backreaction.\n\n6\n\nDiscussion and Conclusion\n\nThe Schwarzschild solution has been cast in a suitable initial value form using comoving co-ordinates [13], wherein pressure does not appear in the source term. Our\ntransformation casts Reissner Nordstr\u00f6m solution in a similar form, but can be considered as collapse with non zero pressure.\nThe initial radial pressure is related to E and the initial mass function to E as well\nas M . The case E < M can be obtained from regular initial data. One may interprete\nthat increasing the radial pressure as compared to the initial density tends to make\nthe singularity globally naked, however the initial data in the latter case turns out to\nbe singular.\nCasting the Reissner Nordstrom metric in a particular co-ordinate system has enabled us to give an example where a naked singularity forms but curvatures are bounded\nwithin the full Cauchy development. By making the Cauchy development explicit in\n\n12\n\n\fterms of co-ordinates,one can choose to work with certain states like Hadamard states\nwhich guarantee the global validity of Wald axioms, once they are specified near the\ninitial Cauchy surface. This provides stronger support for physical interpretation of\nthe results obtained in the Cauchy development, in particular near the Cauchy horizon. The results on which these interpretations are based could have been drawn using\nthe usual co-ordinates in which the Reissner Nordstrom solution is presented (with a\nsuitable modification on the Cauchy horizon). However, a separate justification for the\nglobal validity of Wald axioms would have had to be given. We have avoided this.\nThe semiclassical analysis recovers Hiscock's result for E < M which shows that\nthe quantum stress tensor diverges on the Cauchy horizon, however with assumptions\nnow made only on initial data. This indicates that the suggestion that there is burst of\nenergy from the singularity is actually a consequence of choice of certain initial data.\nIn actual physical systems, the burst could be large but finite. To examine this\nfurther, we analyze the domain of semiclassical validity and radiation therein to conclude about the behaviour of initial data leading to naked singularities. Only one\nPlanck mass of the mass of the classical configuration is evaporated away upto one\nPlanck time of the classical Cauchy horizon. This behaviour is similar to the spherical\ndust case. We thus provide an example of an initial data configuration which collapses\nalmost intact throughout the semiclassical domain upto the Planck length cutoff. However, in this example, the semiclassical domain extends beyond this cut-off. These two\nresults put together support the interpretation that a sudden burst occurs near the\nCauchy horizon, possibly for some initial data configurations.\nThe picture of semiclassical collapse in the dust model has been used to emphasize\nthe need to invoke quantum gravity for understanding the spacetime region classically\ncorresponding to the Cauchy development, in spherical symmetry. In the Reissner\nNordstr\u00f6m metric, on the contrary, that is not necessary. This would have been significant physically but for the backreaction factor. The latter, however, does not clearly\nindicate the occurence of a burst in the Reissner Nordstr\u00f6m case. Rather, prominence\nof backreaction over the quantum energy seen near the Cauchy horizon suggests that\nthe Reissner Nordstr\u00f6m case appears to be unsuitable as a background in the region\nnear the Cauchy horizon. We note here that physical unsuitability near the horizon is\nalso suggested by non-local quantities or observer dependent divergences (eg. [7], [4]).\nThe analysis was carried out considering backreaction of perturbations to the geometry\nnear the horizon. However, we note that the unperturbed solution is certainly valid\nas a background over a period of evolution. We recover the same result comparing\nthe quantum energies with the curvature. In fact, the solution behaves almost entirely\nclassically throughout the evolution.\nSince we have been emphasizing the region near the Cauchy horizon, a few comments on its classical nature are in order. Although the horizon will manifest as\na surface generated by null rays in spacetime, behaviour of certain quantities along\ngeodesics show irregularities. For a precise description see [19]. However, the horizon\ndoes not qualify to be a physical barrier in the classical sense as the so called 'singularity' there is weak in the Tipler sense (volumes stay bounded below in approach to\nthe horizon). Thus the semiclassical results which do in fact suggest drastic physical\nbehaviour near the horizon, assume significance.\nWe conclude that behaviour in spherical collapse, involves the interplay of the\nsemiclassical domain, onset of quantum gravity regime and prominence of backreaction,\n\n13\n\n\fwhich need not be typical. We draw this conclusion based on a premise for initial\nconditions, unlike previous work. It may be still true that the contrasting physical\nbehaviour of two kinds of initial data, indicated by spherical dust, is typical. One\npossible way for that to hold is the likely prominence of backreaction whenever the\nonset of quantum gravity is delayed, much like in the example given. It is not known if\nthis could just be the case for backgrounds which are physically reasonable. For future\nwork, we therefore suggest that more realistic examples be considered.\n\n7\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nPart of this work was carried out by S.B. at Albert Einstein Institut, Max Planck Institut f\u00fcr Gravitationsphysik, Bundesrepublik Deutschland.
