We group\nthe strongest Fe II multiplets into three groups according to the lower term of the transition\n(b 4 F , a 6 S and a 4 G terms). These correspond approximately to the blue, central, and red\npart respectively of the \"iron shelf\" around H\u03b2. We calculate an Fe II template which takes\ninto account transitions into these three terms and an additional group of lines, based on a\nreconstruction of the spectrum of I Zw 1. This Fe II template gives a more precise fit of the\nFe II lines in broad-line AGNs than other templates. We extract Fe II, H\u03b1, H\u03b2, [O III] and [N II]\nemission parameters and investigate correlations between them. We find that Fe II lines probably\noriginate in an Intermediate Line Region. We notice that the blue, red, and central parts of the\niron shelf have different relative intensities in different objects. Their ratios depend on continuum\nluminosity, FWHM H\u03b2, the velocity shift of Fe II, and the H\u03b1/H\u03b2 flux ratio. We examine the\ndependence of the well-known anti-correlation between the equivalent widths of Fe II and [O III]\non continuum luminosity. We find that there is a Baldwin effect for [O III] but an inverse Baldwin\neffect for the Fe II emission. The [O III]/Fe II ratio thus decreases with L\u03bb5100 . Since the ratio is\na major component of the Boroson and Green eigenvector 1, this implies a connection between\nthe Baldwin effect and eigenvector 1, and could be connected with AGN evolution. We find that\nspectra are different for H\u03b2 FWHMs greater and less than \u223c3000 kms\u22121 , and that there are\ndifferent correlation coefficients between the parameters.\nSubject headings: atomic processes \u2013 galaxies: active \u2013 (galaxies:) quasars: emission lines\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nSome of the problems connected with Fe II\nemission are:\n1. There have been suggestions that Fe II\nemission cannot be explained with standard\nphotoionization models (see Collin & Joly 2000;\nCollin-Souffrin et al. 1980, and references therein).\nTo explain the Fe II emission, additional mechanisms of excitation have been proposed: a)\ncontinuum fluorescence (Phillips 1978a, 1979),\nb) collisional excitation (Joly 1981, 1987, 1991;\nVeron et al. 2006), c) self-fluorescence among Fe II\ntransitions (Netzer & Wills 1983), d) fluorescent\nexcitation by the Ly\u03b1 and Ly\u03b2 lines (Penston\n1988; Verner et al. 1999).\n\nOptical Fe II (\u03bb\u03bb 4400-5400 \u00c5) emission is one\nof the most interesting features in AGN spectra.\nThe emission arises from numerous transitions of\nthe complex Fe II ion. Fe II emission is seen in\nalmost all type-1 AGN spectra and it is especially\nstrong in narrow-line Seyfert 1s (NLS1s). It can\nalso appear in the polarized flux of type-2 AGNs\nwhen a hidden BLR can be seen. Origin of the optical Fe II lines, the mechanisms of their excitation\nand location of the Fe II emission region in AGN,\nare still open questions. There are also many correlations between Fe II emission and other AGN\nproperties which need a physical explanation.\n1\n\n\f2. There are uncertainties about where the\nFe II emission line region is located in an AGN.\nA few proposed solutions are that the Fe II lines\narise: a) in the same emission region as the broad\nH\u03b2 line (Boroson & Green 1992), b) in the accretion disk near the central black hole, which\nproduces the double-peaked broad Balmer emission lines (Collin-Souffrin et al. 1980; Zhang et al.\n2006), c) in a region which can be heated by\nshocks or from an inflow, located between BLR\nand NLR \u2013 the so-called the Intermediate Line\nRegion (Marziani & Sulentic 1993; Popovi\u0107 et al.\n2004, 2007, 2009; Hu et al. 2008a; Kuehn et al.\n2008) and d) and in the shielded, neutral, outer\nregion of a flattened BLR (Gaskell et al. 2007;\nGaskell 2009).\n3. It has long been established that the\nFe II emission is correlated with the radio, X\nand IR continuum. Fe II lines are stronger\nin spectra of Radio Quiet (RQ) AGNs, than\nin Radio Loud (RL) objects (Osterbrock 1977;\nBergeron & Kunth 1984). But, if we consider RL\nAGNs, Fe II emission is stronger in Core Dominant (CD) AGNs than in Lobe Dominant (LD)\nAGNs (Setti & Woltjer 1977; Joly 1991). The relative strength of the Fe II lines correlates with\nthe soft X-ray slope, but anti-correlates with Xray luminosity (Wilkes et al. 1987; Boller et al.\n1996; Lawrence et al. 1997). Strong optical Fe II\nemission is usually associated with strong IR luminosity (Low et al. 1989; Lipari et al. 1993), but\nit is anti-correlated with IR color index \u03b1(60,25)\n(Wang et al. 2006).\n4. Many correlations have been observed between Fe II and other emission lines. Boroson & Green\n(1992) give a number of correlations between the\nequivalent width (EW) of Fe II and properties of\nthe [O III] and H\u03b2 lines. The most interesting\nare the anti-correlations of EW Fe II vs. EW\n[O III]/EW H\u03b2, EW Fe II vs. peak [O III], EW\nFe II/EW H\u03b2 vs. peak [O III], and the correlation\nof EW Fe II/EW H\u03b2 vs. H\u03b2 asymmetry. An anticorrelation between EW Fe II and FWHM of H\u03b2\nhas been also found (Gaskell 1985; Zheng & Keel\n1991; Boroson & Green 1992). These correlations dominate the first eigenvector of the principal component analysis of Boroson & Green\n(1992) (hereinafter EV1). Correlations between\nEV1 and some properties of C IV \u03bb1549 \u00c5 lines\nhave also been pointed out (Baskin & Laor 2004).\n2\n\nWith increasing continuum luminosity, the EW of\nthe C IV lines decreases, (the so-called \"Baldwin effect\", Baldwin 1977; Wang et al. 1995),\nwhile the blueshift of the C IV line and the\nEW of Fe II increase. Recently, Dong et al.\n(2009) have found the Baldwin effect to be related to EV1. Fe II lines are usually strong\nin AGN spectra with low-ionization Broad Absorption Lines (BALs) (Harting & Baldwin 1986;\nBoroson & Meyers 1992).\nSearching for a physical cause of these correlations may help in understanding of the origin of Fe II emission. Some of physical properties which may influence these correlations\nare: Eddington ratio (L/LEdd ) (Boroson & Green\n1992; Baskin & Laor 2004), black hole mass\n(MBH ) and inclination angle (Miley & Miller\n1979; Wills & Browne 1986; Marziani et al. 2001).\nIn addition to these properties, Fe II emission strength may vary with evolution of AGNs.\nFor example, Lipari & Terlevich (2006) have explained some properties of AGN (as BALs, Fe II\nstrength, radio properties, emission line width, luminosity of narrow lines, etc.) by an \"evolutive\nunification model\". In this model, accretion arises\nfrom the interaction between nuclear starbursts\nand the supermassive black hole. This would mean\nthat not only the orientation, but also the evolutionary state of an AGN, influence its spectral\nproperties. Thus, young AGN have strong Fe II,\nBALs, weak radio emission, the NLR is compact\nand faint, and broad lines are relatively narrow.\nIn contrast with this, old AGNs have weak Fe II,\nno BALs, strong radio emission with extended radio lobes, the NLR is extended and bright, and\nthe broad lines have greater velocity widths.\nIn this paper, we investigate the Fe II emitting\nregion by analyzing the correlations between the\noptical Fe II lines and the other emission lines in\na sample of 302 AGN from the SDSS. To do this\nwe construct an Fe II template. The strongest\nFe II multiplets within the \u03bb\u03bb4400-5500 \u00c5 range\nare sorted into three groups, according to the\nlower terms of the transitions: 3d6 ( 3 F 2)4s 4 F ,\n3d5 4s2 6 S and 3d6 ( 3 G)4s 4 G (which we will hereinafter refer to as the F , S and G groups of lines).\nThe F group mainly contains the lines from the\nFe II multiplets 37 and 38 and describes the blue\npart of the Fe II shelf relative to H\u03b2. The S group\nof lines describes the part of Fe II emission un-\n\n\fder H\u03b2 and [O III] and contains lines from multiples 41, 42 and 43 Fe II. Finally, the G group\ncontains lines from multiplets 48 and 49, and describes the red part of the Fe II shelf. A simplified Grotrian diagram of these transitions is shown\nin Figure 1. We analyze separately their relationships with other lines in AGN spectra (H\u03b2, [O III],\nH\u03b1, [N II]). In this way, we try to connect details of the Fe II emission with physical properties\nof the AGN emission regions in which these lines\narise. Each of the Fe II multiplet groups has specific characteristics, which may be reflected in a\ndifferent percent of correlations with other lines,\nand give us more information about the complex\nFe II emission region.\nThe paper is organized as follows: In Sect. 2 we\ndescribe the procedure of sample selection and details of analysis; our results are presented in Sect.\n3; in Sect. 4 we give discussion of obtained results,\nand finally in Sect. 5 we outline our conclusions.\n2.\n\n5. presence of the narrow [O III] and the broad\nH\u03b2 component (FWHM H\u03b2 > 1000 kms\u22121 ).\nWe found 497 AGNs using the mentioned criteria. However, on inspection of the spectra we\nfound that in some of them the Fe II line emission is within the level of noise and could not be\nproperly fitted, so we excluded these objects from\nfurther analysis (see Appendix A). As result, our\nfinal sample contains 302 spectra, from which 137\nhave all Balmer lines, and the rest are without\nthe H\u03b1 line (due to cosmological redshifts). The\nsample distribution by continuum luminosity (\u03bb\n5100 \u00c5) and by cosmological redshift is given in\nFigure 2. Corrections for Galactic extinction were\nmade using an empirical selective extinction function computed for each spectrum on the basis of\nGalactic extinction coefficients given by Schlegel\n(1998) and available from the NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database2 . Finally, all spectra were\nde-redshifted.\nTo subtract the continuum, we used the DIPSO\nsoftware, finding the continuum level by using continuum windows given in the paper of\nKuraszkiewicz et al. (2002) (see Figure 3). The\nused continuum windows are: 3010-3040 \u00c5, 32403270 \u00c5, 3790-3810 \u00c5, 4210-4230 \u00c5, 5080-5100 \u00c5,\n5600-5630 \u00c5 and 5970-6000 \u00c5. We used the same\nprocedure to subtract the continuum in all objects. Continuum subtraction may cause systemic\nerrors in the estimation of line parameters and\ncontinuum luminosity. We estimated that the error bars are smaller than 5%, especially within the\nH\u03b1+[N II] region and in the red part of the \"iron\nshelf\".\nWe considered two spectral ranges: \u03bb\u03bb 44005500 \u00c5 and \u03bb\u03bb 6400-6800 \u00c5. In the first range,\ndominant lines are the numerous Fe II lines, [O III]\n\u03bb\u03bb4959, 5007 \u00c5, H\u03b2 and He II \u03bb4686 \u00c5, and in the\nsecond range, H\u03b1 and [N II] \u03bb\u03bb6548, 6583 \u00c5.\nTo investigate correlations between the Fe II\nmultiplets and other lines in spectra, we fit all\nconsidered lines with Gaussians. The optical Fe II\nlines were fitted with a template calculated as described in the next section.\n\nThe sample and analysis\n\n2.1.\n\nThe AGN sample\n\nSpectra for our data sample are taken from the\nthe 7th data release (Abazajian et al. 2009) of the\nSloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). For the purposes\nof the work, we chose AGNs with the following\ncharacteristics:\n1. high signal to noise ratio (S/N > 20),\n2. good pixel quality (profiles are not affected\nby distortions due to bad pixels on the sensors, the presence of strong foreground or\nbackground sources),\n3. high redshift confidence (zConf>0.95) and\nwith z \u2264 0.7 in order to cover the optical\nFe II lines around H\u03b2 and [O III] lines,\n4. negligible contribution from the stellar component. We controlled for this by having the\nEWs of typical absorption lines be less then\n1 \u00c5 (EW CaK 3934 \u00c5, Mg 5177 \u00c5 and H\u03b4\n4102 \u00c5>-1).1 Because of this it was not necessary to remove a host galaxy starlight contribution.\n1\n\n2 http://nedwww.ipac.caltech.edu/\n\nFor some objects we were able to find estimates of the stellar component in the literature and to confirm that the host\ngalaxy fraction is indeed small in our sample (see Appendix\nA).\n\n3\n\n\f2.2.\n\nThe Fe II (\u03bb\u03bb 4400-5500 \u00c5) template\n\nmajority of multiplets dominant in the optical part\n(\u03bb\u03bb 4400-5500 \u00c5), whose lines can be clearly idenA number of authors have created an Fe II\ntified in AGN spectra, have one of the three spetemplate in the UV and optical range (see\ncific lower terms of their transitions: F , S or G,\nVestergaard & Wilkes 2001, and references therein).\nand (b) beside these lines there are also lines whose\nBoroson & Green (1992) applied empirical temorigin is not well known but which presumably\nplate by removing all lines which are not Fe II,\noriginate from higher levels.\nfrom the spectrum of I Zw 1.

The missing Fe II\nemission is around \u223c4450 \u00c5, \u223c4630 \u00c5, \u223c5130 \u00c5\nand \u223c5370 \u00c5.\nThere are some indications that fluorescence\nprocesses may have a role in producing some Fe II\nlines (Verner et al. 1999; Hartman & Johansson\n2000). Process like self-fluorescence, continuumfluorescence or Ly\u03b1 and Ly\u03b2 pumping could supply enough energy to excite the Fe II lines with\nhigh energy of excitation, which could be one of\nthe explanation for emission within these wavelength regions. To complete the template for approximately of 25% missing Fe II flux, we selected\n15 lines from the Kurutz database4 with wavelengths close to those of the extra emission, upper level excitation energies of up to \u223c13 eV, and\nstrong oscillator strengths. We measured their relative intensities in I Zw 1 which has a well-studied\nspectrum (Veron-Cetty et al. 2004) spectrum with\nstrong and narrow Fe II lines. Relative intensities\nof these 15 lines were obtained by making the best\nfit of the I Zw 1 spectrum with the Fe II lines from\nthe F , S, and G line groups. The extra lines are\nrepresented in Figure 1 (bottom), with a dotted\nline.\nOur template of Fe II is described by 7 free\nfitting parameters: width, shift, four parameters\nof intensity (for the F , S and G line groups and\nfor the lines with relative intensities obtained from\nI Zw 1). The seventh parameter is the excitation\ntemperature included in the calculation of relative\nintensities within F , S and G line groups.\nWe found that for the majority of objects, the\nexcitation temperature obtained from our fit is\nwithin the range: 9000 K \u2013 11000 K (see Figure\n4), which agrees well with theoretical predictions\n(Collin & Joly 2000). However, as it could be seen\nin Eq. (1), our fit is not very sensitive to the\ntemperature, especially for T>8000 K. Eq. (1) is\nalso very approximate so estimated temperatures\n\nshould be treated with caution.\nTo estimate the error in the excitation temperature, we found our best fit for a number of objects. We then changed only the excitation temperature while keeping the other fit parameters\nfixed. We thus found \u03c72max for which the fit is\nstill reasonable. After that, we constructed \u03c72\nvs. T and measured the dispersion in temperature at 0.1*(\u03c72max -\u03c72min ). We obtained error-bars\nthat were mostly within the range \u00b125%, with tendency for higher temperature to have a greater uncertainty. In further analysis we will therefore not\nconsider the temperatures obtained from the fit.\nThe wavelengths of the 50 template lines are\npresented in Tables 1 and 2. For the 35 lines from\nthe three line groups we give multiplet names,\nconfigurations of the transitions generating those\nlines, oscillator strengths and the relative intensities. The intensities have been calculated using\nthe Eq. (1) for excitation temperatures T = 5000,\n10000 and 15000 K (Table 1). For the 15 lines for\nwhich relative intensities were measured in I Zw 1,\nwe give wavelengths, configurations and oscillator\nstrengths taken from Kurucz database, as well as\ntheir measured relative intensities (Table 2).\nThe purpose of dividing the Fe II emission into\nfour groups is to investigate the correlations between the iron lines which arise from different multiplets and some spectral properties, and to compare it with results obtained for the total Fe II\nwithin the observed range. Also, a template which\nhas more parameters may give a better fit, since\nrelative intensities among Fe II lines can be different even in the similar AGN spectra, as is, for\nexample, the case for spectra of I Zw 1 and Mrk\n42 (as e.g. Phillips 1978b).\nWe applied this template to our sample of 302\nAGNs from SDSS database, and we compare it\nwith other theoretical and empirical models (see\nAppendix B). We found that the template fit Fe II\nemission very well (Figure 23 and Figure 24). In\nthe cases when the Fe II emission of an object has\ndifferent properties from I Zw 1, small disagreements are noticed in the lines for which the relative intensity was obtained from I Zw 1. However,\nthe Fe II emission in these objects shows larger\ndisagreement with the empirical and theoretical\nmodels considered in Appendix B (see Figure 25).\nAlthough our Fe II template has more free parameters than other templates used for fitting the Fe II\n\n4 http://www.pmp.uni-hannover.de/cgi-\n\nbin/ssi/test/kurucz/sekur.html\n\n5\n\n\femission, it enables more precise fit of Fe II lines in\nsome AGNs (especially with very broad H\u03b2 line)\nthan the other Fe II templates we considered.\n2.3.\n\nmaticaly different regions: a \"Very Broad Line\nRegion\" (VBLR), and an \"Intermediate Line Region\" (ILR). We therefore tested fitting the broad\nlines with one and two Gaussians. We found that\nin most AGNs in our sample, the fit with two\nGaussians was significantly better than the fit\nwith one Gaussian.\nTo apply a uniform model of the line fitting procedure, we assumed that Balmer lines have three\ncomponents from the NLR, ILR and VBLR. We\nexclude 4 spectra from the sample in which H\u03b1\nline could not be decomposed in this way, so finally our sample contains 133 spectra (from 137)\nwith all Balmer lines which could be analyzed\nwithin the \u03bb\u03bb 6400-6800 \u00c5 range. To check this\nassumption on the rest of the spectra, we examined the corresponding correlations and we found\nthat the luminosities and widths of the NLR, ILR\nand VBLR components of H\u03b1 are highly correlated with the same parameters of the NLR, ILR\nand VBLR components of H\u03b2. This is in favor\nof our three component decomposition (Table 3).\nFor the 133 objects, which have both H\u03b2 and H\u03b1\nlines, it can be noticed that 16 spectra have large\nredshifts of the VBLR H\u03b2 component relative to\nVBLR of H\u03b1, which causes disagreement and reduces the correlation between the VBLR shifts\nof the rest of objects. Without these 16 objects,\nH\u03b2 and H\u03b1 VBLR components correlate in width\nand shift, with coefficient of correlation \u223c 0.40,\nP < 0.0001. An example of shifts between the\nH\u03b1 and H\u03b2 VBLR components is shown in Figure\n5. The AGN SDSS J111603.13 + 020852.2 has its\nVBLR H\u03b2 component redshifted by \u22484258 kms\u22121 ,\nwhile shift of the H\u03b1 VBLR component is \u2248-1200\nkms\u22121 .\nWe assume that all narrow lines (and narrow\ncomponents of the broad lines), originate from\nthe same NLR, and thus expect that these lines\nwill have the same shifts and widths. We therefore took the Gaussian parameters of the shift and\nwidth of [O III], [N II], and the NLR components\nof H\u03b2 and H\u03b1 to have the same values.\nWe separately fit lines from the \u03bb\u03bb 4400-5500\n\u00c5 range (Fe II lines, [O III], He II and H\u03b2) with\n23 free parameters, and lines from the \u03bb\u03bb 64006800 \u00c5 range (H\u03b1 and [N II]) with 8 free parameters. We applied a \u03c72 minimization routine\n(Popovi\u0107 et al. 2004), to obtain the best fit. Examples of an AGN spectrum fit in both ranges are\n\nEmission line decomposition and fitting procedure\n\nWe assume that broad emission lines arise in\ntwo or more emission regions (Brotherton et al.\n1994; Popovi\u0107 et al. 2004; Bon et al. 2006, 2009;\nIli\u0107 et al. 2006), so that their profiles are sums of\nGaussians with different shifts, widths and intensities, which reflect the physical conditions of the\nemitting regions where the components arise.\nFor this reason, we fit the emission lines we considered ([O III] \u03bb\u03bb4959, 5007 \u00c5, H\u03b2, He II \u03bb4686\n\u00c5, H\u03b1 and [N II] \u03bb\u03bb6548, 6583 \u00c5) with a sum of\nGaussians, describing one Gaussian with 3 parameters (width, intensity and shift from transition\nwavelength).\nBoth lines of the [O III] \u03bb\u03bb4959, 5007 \u00c5 doublet originate from the same lower energy level and\nboth have a negligible optical depth since the transitions are strongly forbidden. Taking this into account, we assumed that the [O III] \u03bb4959 \u00c5 and\n[O III] \u03bb5007 \u00c5 lines have the same emission-line\nprofile. We fit each line of the doublet with either\na single Gaussian, or, in the case of a significant\nasymmetry, with two Gausssians. The Gaussian\nthat describes the [O III] \u03bb4959 \u00c5, has the same\nwidth and shift, as the one which describes [O III]\n\u03bb5007 \u00c5 line, and we took their intensity ratio to\nbe 2.99 (Dimitrijevi\u0107 et al. 2007). [N II] \u03bb\u03bb6548,\n6583 \u00c5 were fitted using the same procedure, with\nan intensity ratio of the doublet components of\n\u2248 3. The He II \u03bb4686 \u00c5 line was fitted with one\nbroad Gaussian.\nTo fit the Balmer lines a number of Gaussian\nfunctions were used for each line. It is usually assumed that there are two components for H\u03b1 and\nH\u03b2: a narrow component representing the NLR,\nand a broad one representing the BLR. However,\nthe broad emission lines (BELs), are very complex and cannot be properly explained by single Gaussian (which would indicate an isotropic\nspherical region). Moreover, there are some papers\n(Brotherton et al. 1994; Corbin & Boroson 1996;\nPopovi\u0107 et al. 2004; Ili\u0107 et al. 2006; Bon et al.\n2006, 2009; Hu et al. 2008b) where the broad\nlines are assumed to be emitted from two kine-\n\n6\n\n\fshown in Figure 6 and Figure 7.\n2.4.\n\n1.44\u00b10.55, of the F/S ratio 1.97\u00b11.05, and of the\nG/S ratio 1.39\u00b10.465. We found that the majority of objects have Fe II group ratios close to\nthe average values, but still significant number of\nobjects are showing difference since the intensity\nratios of Fe II line groups vary in different objects\n(see Figure 10). The ratios of the Fe II line groups\nin I Zw 1 are indicated by the vertical dashed lines\n(F/G = 1.10, F/S = 1.56 and G/S = 1.41).\nWe analyzed the flux ratios of the Fe II multiplet groups and the total Fe II flux (see histograms in Figure 11), and we found that lines\nfrom multiplets 37 and 38 (group F ) generally\nhave the largest contribution to the total Fe II\nemission within the \u03bb\u03bb4400-5500 \u00c5 range (about\n32%), while group S contributes about 18% and\nG about 23%. As expected, there are very strong\ncorrelations between the equivalent widths of Fe II\nline groups (Table 4).\nSince line intensities and their ratios are indicators of physical properties of the plasma where\nthose lines arise, we have investigated relations\namong the ratios of Fe II line groups with various spectral properties. A correlation between the\nFWHM H\u03b2 and the EW Fe II emission has been\nfound previously (Gaskell 1985; Boroson & Green\n1992; Sulentic et al. 2009). Consequently, one can\nexpect that FWHM H\u03b2 may be connected with\nthe Fe II line group ratios. We therefore investigated correlations between the ratios of the Fe II\ngroups (F/G, F/S, and G/S) and H\u03b2 FWHM.\nWe excluded the three outliers, which have negligible flux for S group. As it can be seen in\nFigure 12 (first panel) there are different trends\nfor spectra with FWHM H\u03b2 less than and greater\nthan \u223c3000 kms\u22121 . Therefore, we divided the\nsample into two sub-samples: 158 objects with\nFWHM H\u03b2 <3000 kms\u22121 and 141 objects with\nFWHM H\u03b2 >3000 kms\u22121 (see Figure 12 and Table 5). A similar subdivision of AGN samples\nwas performed by Sulentic et al. (2002, 2009), but\nfor FWHM H\u03b2 \u2248 4000 kms\u22121 as the limiting\nFWHM of the subdivision. We found that FWHM\nH\u03b2 \u2248 3000 kms\u22121 is more a appropriate place\nto divide the objects into two groups, since all\nobjects with strongly redshifted VBLR H\u03b2 component (see Figure 5) belong to the FWHM H\u03b2\n>3000 kms\u22121 subsample. Sulentic et al. (2002)\n\nLine parameters\n\nWe compared the shifts, widths, equivalent\nwidths, and luminosities of the lines. The shifts\nand widths were obtained directly from the fit (parameters of width and shift). Luminosities were\ncalculated using the formulae given in Peebles\n(1993), with adopted cosmological parameters:\n\u03a9M = 0.27, \u03a9\u039b = 0.73 and \u03a9k = 0. We adopt\na Hubble constant, Ho = 71 kms\u22121 Mpc\u22121 . The\ncontinuum luminosity was obtained from the average value of continuum flux measured between\n5100 \u00c5 (\u03bb\u03bb5095-5100 \u00c5 and \u03bb\u03bb5100-5105 \u00c5).\nEquivalent widths were measured with respect to\nthe continuum below the lines. The continuum\nwas estimated by subtracting all fitted lines from\nthe observed spectra. Then, the line of interest\n(or the Fe II template), which is fit separately,\nis added to the continuum. Equivalent widths\nare obtained by normalizing the lines on continuum level, and measuring their fluxes (see Figure\n8). To determine the full width at half maximum\n(FWHM) of the broad component of the Balmer\nlines, the VBLR and ILR components from the\nfit are considered as it is shown in Figure 9. The\nbroad Balmer line (VBLR+ILR) is then normalized on unity, and the FWHM is measured at half\nof the maximum intensity.\n3.\n3.1.\n\nResults\nThe ratios of Fe II line groups vs.\nother spectral properties\n\nSome objects have relative intensities of Fe II\nlines similar to I Zw 1, while others show significant disagreement, which usually shows up as\nstronger iron emission in the blue bump (mainly F\nlines) than one in the red bump (mainly G lines),\ncomparing to I Zw 1. That objects could be fitted\nwell with the template model which assumes that\nrelative intensities between the Fe II lines from different line groups (F , S and G) are different for\ndifferent objects.\nDifference between the relative intensities of the\nFe II lines from different parts of iron shelf (blue,\nred and central) can be illustrated well with histograms of distribution of the Fe II group ratio\n(F /G, F /S and G/S) for the sample (Figure 10).\nThe average value of the F/G luminosity ratio is\n\n5\n\n7\n\nHere we give the averaged ratio value and dispersion.\n\n\falso noticed that AGN with FWHM H\u03b2 >4000\nkms\u22121 , have a larger redshifted VBLR H\u03b2 (\u223c5000\nkms\u22121 ).\nIn Table 5 we present the correlations between\nthe luminosity ratios of the Fe II line groups and\nother spectral properties such as: FWHM H\u03b2,\nDoppler width of H\u03b2 broad components, width\nand shift of iron lines and continuum luminosity\n(L\u03bb5100 ). They are examined for the total sample and for two sub-samples, divided according to\nFWHM H\u03b2, and denoted in Table 5 as (1) for\nFWHM H\u03b2 <3000 kms\u22121 and (2) for H\u03b2 FWHM\n>3000 kms\u22121 .\nWe found a difference in the correlations for\nthose two sub-samples. For the H\u03b2 FWHM > 3000\nkms\u22121 sub-sample (2) all three ratios (F/G, F/S\nand G/S) increase as H\u03b2 width increases. On the\nother hand, for the H\u03b2 FWHM < 3000 kms\u22121 subsample no correlation is observed between these\nproperties.\nThe observed correlation between the G/S\ngroup ratio and H\u03b2 FWHM may be caused by\nintrinsic reddening since reddening increases as\nobjects get more edge-on (Gaskell et al. 2004) and\nthe H\u03b2 FWHM also increases (Wills & Browne\n1986). However, this cannot explain the F/G\nand F/S correlation with H\u03b2 FWHM, and also, a\nstrong influence of reddening on the G/S ratio is\nnot expected because of the close wavelengths of\nlines from those groups.\nWe also studied correlations between continuum luminosity (L\u03bb5100 ) and Fe II group ratios,\nsince these may indicate excitation processes in\nthe emitting region. We found that the F/G and\nF/S ratios decrease in objects where the continuum level is higher. Observed correlations are\nstronger for H\u03b2 FWHM < 3000 kms\u22121 sub-sample\n(F/G vs. L\u03bb5100 : r = \u22120.51, P < 0.0001 and F/S\nvs. L\u03bb5100 : r = \u22120.41, P < 0.0001). The ratio\nof G/S seems not to be dependent on continuum\nluminosity.\nThese correlations are the opposite of what\nwould be expected from reddening, since reddening decreases with luminosity (Gaskell et al.\n2004). There are a few effects that could destroy\nexpected reddening effect: (i) incorrect continuum\nsubtraction, (ii) host galaxy fraction which depends on the Eddington ratio and (iii) different\ncontribution of starlight in SDSS fiber which de-\n\npends on the luminosity of the host galaxy and the\nredshift (see Gaskell and Kormendy 2009). There\nis a small possibility that these effects are important. As we already noted, the error-bar in the\ncontinuum subtraction is smaller than 5%. Also,\nwe examined if the host galaxy contribution have\ninfluence on considered correlations. We found no\ncorrelations between the host galaxy fraction (determined in \u03bb5100 \u00c5) and Fe II group ratios.6 The\ncorrelations appear instead to be connected with\na weaker Baldwin effect for F group (see Table 7).\nWe also investigated the correlation of the log(L\nH\u03b1/L H\u03b2) with ratios of Fe II groups. We found\ncorrelations with F/G (r = \u22120.36, P < 0.0001)\nand with F/S ratio (r = \u22120.34, P < 0.0001),\nbut there is no correlation with G/S (Figure 13,\nTable 6), i.e., between ratio of red and central\npart. There is possibility that these correlations\nare caused by intrinsic reddening.\n3.2.\n\nConnection between kinematical properties of Fe II lines and Balmer lines\n(H\u03b1 and H\u03b2)\n\nWe assume that broadening of the lines arise\nby Doppler effect caused by random velocities of\nemission clouds, and that shifts of lines are a consequence of systemic motions of the emitting gas.\nWe therefore studied the kinematical connection\namong emission regions by analyzing relationships\nbetween their widths and shifts obtained from our\nbest fits.\nThe Doppler widths of Fe II and Balmer lines\n(H\u03b2 and H\u03b1) are compared in Figure 14. On Xaxis we present Fe II width and on the Y-axis\nthe widths of the H\u03b2 (first panel) and H\u03b1 (second\npanel) components. The widths of the NLR components are denoted by triangles, the ILR components with circles, and the VBLR components\nwith squares.

(2006) for 106 common objects (see Appendix A).\n\n8\n\n\f(VBLR). For the selected sample of 133 AGNs\nwhich have the H\u03b1 line in the spectra (second\npanel), the averaged value of the Fe II width is\n1310 \u00b1 410 kms\u22121 and for the H\u03b1 components:\n240 \u00b1 90 kms\u22121 (NLR), 1160 \u00b1 560 kms\u22121 (ILR)\nand 4060\u00b11650 kms\u22121 (VBLR). It is obvious that\nthe averaged Fe II width (\u223c 1400 kms\u22121 ) is very\nclose to the average widths of the ILR H\u03b2 and\nH\u03b1 components (1568 kms\u22121 and 1156 kms\u22121 respectively), while the averaged widths of NLR and\nVBLR components are significantly different from\nthe Fe II width.\nRelationships among the widths of the Fe II\nand ILR components are also presented in Figure\n15 (Table 7). The correlation between the Fe II\nwidth and the width of H\u03b1 ILR is r = 0.77, P <\n0.0001, and between the Fe II width and the H\u03b2\nILR width it is r = 0.73, P < 0.0001. We also\nfound a correlation between the widths of Fe II\nand the VBLR (r = 0.66, P < 0.0001 for the H\u03b1\nVBLR, and r=0.45, P < 0.0001 for H\u03b2 VBLR).\nRelationships between the shifts of Fe II and\nH\u03b1 and H\u03b2 components were also considered (Table 7). We found correlations with the shifts of the\nH\u03b1 ILR (r = 0.30, P = 0.0004) and the H\u03b2 ILR\ncomponent (r = 0.39, P < 0.0001), but no correlation between the shift of Fe II and the shifts of\nother H\u03b1 and H\u03b2 components.\nWe found that Fe II lines tend to have an averaged redshift of 270\u00b1180 kms\u22121 with respect to\nthe transition wavelength, and with respect to narrow lines 100\u00b1240 kms\u22121 (see Figure 16).\n3.3.\n\ngroups. Correlations are stronger with the ILR\nand VBLR components than with the NLR components. The same analysis was carried out for\nthe luminosities of Fe II line groups and the NLR,\nILR and VBLR components of H\u03b2 (Table 8). NLR\ncomponent of H\u03b2 also has a weaker correlation\nwith Fe II lines (r\u223c0.60, P<0.0001) than broad\nH\u03b2 components (r\u223c0.90, P<0.0001).\nWe also investigated the anti-correlations between EW Fe II and EW [O III], and between EW\nFe II and EW [O III]/EW H\u03b2 (Boroson & Green\n1992). We confirmed the existence of these relationships in our sample, with Fe II lines separated\ninto F , S, and G line groups (Figure 17, Table 9).\nA difference from Boroson & Green (1992), who\nmeasured the equivalent widths of all lines referring to the continuum level at the \u03bb4861 \u00c5, is that\nwe calculated the equivalent widths by estimating\nthe continuum below all the Fe II lines considered\n(see Figure 8). Note also that Boroson & Green\n(1992) used mainly measurements from lines from\nmultiplets 37 and 38.\nWe found a correlation between total EW Fe II\nand EW [O III] r = \u22120.39, P < 0.0001. The\ncorrelation coefficient was significantly lower for\nthe lines obtained from I Zw 1 (r = \u22120.20, P =\n0.0006) than for the other three groups (see Table 9). We also analyzed relationships between\nEW Fe II line groups and EW [O III]/EW H\u03b2.\nFor total EW Fe II we found r= - 0.46, P<0.0001\n(Figure 17, right), but for lines from I Zw 1 group\nr= - 0.28, P<0.0001.\nNo significant correlations were found between\nEW Fe II and EW [N II] lines (Table 9).\nWe also investigated whether there were any\ntrends between equivalent widths of Fe II F , S,\nG line groups and equivalent widths of NLR, ILR\nand VBLR H\u03b1 and H\u03b2 components (Table 9). We\nfound no significant correlations.\nThe correlations between EW Fe II and the\nDoppler widths of H\u03b2 components are also considered (Table 10). As was expected, an inverse\ncorrelation was found between EW Fe II and the\nwidths of the broad H\u03b2 components (ILR and\nVBLR, as well as for the H\u03b2 FWHM, r \u223c \u22120.30,\nP < 0.0001). These correlations are part of EV 1.\nBut, contrary to this, we found a positive correlation (r = 0.30, P < 0.0001) between the EW Fe II\nand the width of NLR component.\n\nCorrelations between the Fe II line\ngroups and other emission lines\n\nCorrelations between the luminosity of the Fe II\nmultiplet groups, total Fe II and luminosities of\nthe [N II] and [O III] lines are presented in Table\n8. In the L [N II] vs. L Fe II plot, seven outliers are\nobserved with negligible [N II]. They are probably\ncaused by an underestimate in the fit of the [N II]\nlines due to the blending with the H\u03b1 line. Without these outliers, correlation is \u223c 0.70, P<0.0001.\nThere is no correlation between L [N II]/L [O III]\nvs. L Fe II.\nWe analyzed relationships among the luminosities of the Fe II line groups and the NLR, ILR\nand VBLR H\u03b1 components (Table 8). All three\nH\u03b1 components are correlated with the Fe II line\n\n9\n\n\f3.4.\n\nRelations among emission line strength\nand continuum luminosity\n\nThe only exception is the correlation of EW H\u03b2\nNLR/EW Fe II vs. L\u03bb5100 , which is more significant for the FWHM H\u03b2 <3000 kms\u22121 subsample.\nIt is interesting to connect these anti-correlations\n(EW Fe II vs. EW [O III] and considered ratios vs.\nL\u03bb5100 ) with the Baldwin effect. Baskin & Laor\n(2004) confirmed a correlation between the Baldwin effect and some of the emission parameters\nwhich define Eigenvector 1 correlations (which are\nrelated to EW [O III] - EW Fe II anti-correlation).\nAlso, it has been found that the [O III] lines show\nstrong Baldwin effect (Dietrich et al. 2002). On\nthe other hand, no Baldwin effect has been noticed\nfor the optical Fe II and H\u03b2 lines (Dietrich et al.\n2002), or even an inverse Baldwin Effect has been\nreported: Croom et al. (2002) found an inverse\nBaldwin effect in H\u03b2 and Netzer & Trakhtenbrot\n(2007) found one for both H\u03b2 and optical Fe II\nlines.\nBecause of this, we examined the dependence\nof the equivalent widths of Fe II, H\u03b2 and [O III]\nlines vs. L\u03bb5100 and z in our sample. Since H\u03b2\nis decomposed in NLR, ILR and VBLR and the\niron lines are separated in the groups they can be\nconsidered in more detail. Also, we performed separate analyses for the sub-samples with different\nH\u03b2 FWHM ranges (Table 11).\nAnalyzing the total sample (i.e., the whole H\u03b2\nFWHM range), it is obvious that Fe II lines show\nan inverse Baldwin effect, which is specially strong\nfor the central (r = 0.33, P < 0.0001) and red part\n(r = 0.44, P < 0.0001) of the Fe II shelf (S and G\ngroups), as well as for the group of lines from I Zw\n1 (r = 0.32, P < 0.0001). The correlation of total\nFe II vs. L\u03bb5100 is presented in Figure 20. What\nis interesting is that a strong inverse Baldwin effect is not observed for the F lines (blue part)\n(r = 0.16, P = 0.004). In the relationship between\nH\u03b2 components and continuum luminosity for total sample, no trend is observed for broad H\u03b2 (ILR\nand VBLR), but it can be noticed that the narrow\nH\u03b2 component anti-correlates with continuum luminosity (r = \u22120.36, P < 0.0001), \u2013 i.e. they\nshow a Baldwin effect \u2013 as well as the [O III] lines,\nfor which the previously found trend is confirmed\n(r = \u22120.43, P < 0.0001 \u2013 see Figure 20).\nIf we compare these correlations with the corresponding correlations with redshift, it is obvious\nthat the iron lines (total Fe II and the multiplet\ngroups) correlate more strongly with redshift than\n\nIn Sec 3.3.\nwe have confirmed the anticorrelation EW Fe II vs. EW [O III] (also EW\nFe II vs. EW [O III]/EW H\u03b2). To try to understand the underlying physics which governs this\nanti-correlation, we examined its dependence of\nthe continuum luminosity and redshift.\nBecause of selection effects, cosmological redshift, z, and continuum luminosity are highly correlated in our sample, so it is difficult to clearly\ndistinguish which influence dominates in some correlations. Since our sample has a more uniform\nredshift distribution than continuum luminosity\ndistribution (see Figure 2), we binned equivalent\nwidths of the [O III] and Fe II lines within the\nz = 0 \u2013 0.7 range, using a \u2206z = 0.1 bin size. The\nbinned data are presented in Figure 18. It can be\nseen that as redshift increases in the z < 0.4 range,\nEW Fe II also increases, but EW [O III] decreases\n(Figure 18). For z > 0.4, the trend is not so obvious, probably due to the larger scatter of the data\nat higher redshifts.\nWe derived correlations coefficients for the ratios of the [O III], Fe II and H\u03b2 lines and L\u03bb5100\n(also with redshift, see Figure 19, Table 11). A\nsignificant anti-correlation was found for the ratio of EW [O III]/EW Fe II vs. L\u03bb5100 and for\nEW [O III]/EW Fe II vs. z (r = \u22120.46, P = 0\nand r = \u22120.48, P = 0, respectively). We found\nthat the ratios of EW [O III]/EW H\u03b2 and EW\nH\u03b2 NLR/EW Fe II also decrease as L\u03bb5100 (redshift) increases. As in the previous case, the difference between the P\u2013values for correlation with\nL\u03bb5100 and with z is very small, so we cannot tell\nwhich effect dominates. In contrast to this, for\nEW H\u03b2total /EW Fe II vs. L\u03bb5100 , no significant\ntrend is observed, but for EW H\u03b2total /EW Fe II\nvs. z, there is a weak correlation (r = 0.28, P =\n1.3E-6).\nBecause of discrepancies in the properties observed between sub-samples within different H\u03b2\nFWHM ranges (see Sec 3.1), we analyzed the relationships separately for the sub-samples with\nFWHM H\u03b2 <3000 kms\u22121 and FWHM H\u03b2 >3000\nkms\u22121 . It will be noticed that, in general, all\nthe correlations considered are stronger for the\nFWHM H\u03b2 >3000 kms\u22121 sub-sample than for\nspectra with narrower H\u03b2 lines (see Table 11).\n\n10\n\n\fwith luminosity. In the case of other lines we consider, the difference between the correlations with\nL\u03bb5100 and z, is not so significant. Generally, it\nseems that the lines which show an inverse Baldwin effect (Fe II and H\u03b2 VBLR) correlate more\nsignificantly with redshift than with luminosity,\nwhile the lines which show a (normal) Baldwin effect ([O III] and H\u03b2 NLR) have more significant\ncorrelations with continuum luminosity.\nWe find that the coefficients of correlations between the EWs of lines and the continuum luminosity (and z) depend on the H\u03b2 FWHM range\nof the sub-sample. It seems that continuum luminosity affects iron lines and H\u03b2 more for the subsample with narrower H\u03b2 line (FWHM H\u03b2 <3000\nkms\u22121 ). In that sub-sample all Fe II groups show a\nstronger inverse Baldwin effect, H\u03b2 NLR decreases\nmore strongly with an increase in continuum luminosity, and an inverse Baldwin effect is also observed for H\u03b2 VBLR (r = 0.41, P < 0.0001).\nThis is not seen in the FWHM H\u03b2 >3000 kms\u22121\nsub-sample. In contrast with this the Baldwin effect is stronger in the [O III] lines for the FWHM\nH\u03b2 >3000 kms\u22121 subsample.\n4.\n\nin calculation and found that it is in the most\ncases around 10000 K (9646\u00b12143 K), see Figure\n4. Roughly estimated temperature of the Fe II\nemitting region from our fitting (assumed template) is in a good agreement with the prediction\nearlier given in literature (\u223c7000 K, Joly 1987).\nWe found that the most intensive emission in\nthe optical part arises in transitions with the lower\nterm b 4 F (multiplets 37 and 38). We also considered the ratios of multiplet groups. The line\nratios may indicate some physical properties. For\nexample, it has been shown that the Balmer line\nratios are velocity dependent in AGN (see e.g.\nShuder 1982, 1984; Crenshaw 1986; Stirpe 1990,\n1991; Snedden & Gaskell 2007) and this is probably related to a range of physical conditions (electron temperature and density) and to the radiative transfer effects (see e.g. Popovi\u0107 2003, 2006).\nIn general, the ratios between F, G and S groups\nindicate the ratio between the blue, red and central part of the Fe II shelf around H\u03b2 lines. As\ncan be seen in Table 5, there is correlation between F/G, F/S and G/S ratios vs. FWHM\nof H\u03b2 line. It is interesting that this correlation\nis not present when we consider the cases where\nFWHM(H\u03b2)< 3000 kms\u22121 . We should note here\nthat for the case FWHM(H\u03b2)< 3000 kms\u22121 we\nhad only \u2206FWHM(H\u03b2)\u22482000 km s\u22121 and this\nmay affect the obtained results. As we mentioned above, the separation of the sample into\ntwo sub-samples according to the H\u03b2 FWHM is\nsimilar as given in Sulentic et al. (2009, and reference therein). It seems that the characteristics\nof the Pop A (FWHM H\u03b2 <4000kms\u22121) and B\n(FWHM H\u03b2 >4000kms\u22121) of AGN (as proposed\nby the above-mentioned authors) can be recognized in the Fe II line ratios: namely, the correlations and trends observed in Table 5 indicate that\nthe ratios of blue and red (as well as blue and central) parts of Fe II shelf, anti-correlate with continuum luminosity more strongly in Pop A than in\nPop B. Also, for Pop B, all considered flux ratios\n(F/G, F/S and G/S) increase with increasing of\nH\u03b2 width and with decreasing Fe II shift, while\nthat trend is not observed in Pop A.\nThe observed anti-correlations of F/G and F/S\nratios vs. L\u03bb5100 could be affected by the differing degrees of inverse Baldwin effect observed for\nthe Fe II lines from the three line groups since the\nequivalent widths of the S and G groups increase\n\nDiscussion\n\nFrom our analysis of optical Fe II lines (\u03bb\u03bb\n4400-5400 \u00c5), we can try to investigate physical\nand kinematical characteristics of the Fe II emitting region in AGN as well as the connection between the Fe II and other emission regions. We\nhave investigated above correlations between the\nFe II emission properties and some spectral features. Correlations of the Fe II lines were considered separately for different multiplet groups,\nwhich enable more detailed analysis. Here we give\nsome discussion of the results we have obtained.\n4.1.\n\nThe Fe II line group ratios \u2013 possible\nphysical conditions in the Fe II emitting region\n\nAlthough we used very simple approximations\nto calculate the intensities of the observed Fe II\nlines, we found that the calculated intensities can\nsatisfactorily fit the Fe II shelf within \u03bb\u03bb 44005500 \u00c5 range. This approach is very simplified, but in some cases, it enables better fit than\nmuch more complicated theoretical models (see\nAppendix B). We included excitation temperature\n\n11\n\n\fmore significantly with L\u03bb5100 (r = 0.33 and\nr = 0.43, P < 0.0001, respectively), than those\nof the F group (r = 0.16, P = 0.04, see Table 11).\nNote here that the ratio of G/S does not correlate\nwith the continuum. Also, since the inverse Baldwin effect for the S and G groups is stronger for\nthe FWHM H\u03b2 <3000 kms\u22121 sub-sample, the correlations of F/G and F/S vs. L\u03bb5100 are stronger\nfor FWHM H\u03b2 <3000 kms\u22121 one (Table 5).\nFrom the above-mentioned correlations, we can\nask some intriguing questions about the physical conditions and processes in the Fe II emitting region: (1) which processes cause the increase\nof Fe II equivalent width with increasing L\u03bb5100 ?\nNote that the equivalent widths of the majority\nof other emission lines in AGN spectra decrease\nwith increasing L\u03bb5100 (see Dietrich et al. 2002);\n(2) why is the inverse Baldwin effect correlation\nlower for the F group comparing to the S and G\ngroups? and (3) what causes that inverse Baldwin\neffect for Fe II (in S and G) to be more significant in the sub-sample with FWHM H\u03b2 <3000\nkms\u22121 , than in one with broader H\u03b2 line? Answering some of these questions may lead to a better\nunderstanding of the complex Fe II emitting region.\n4.2.\n\nis a correlation between the Fe II and VBLR regions (r = 0.66, P < 0.0001 for H\u03b1, r = 0.45,\nP < 0.0001 for H\u03b2). This may indicate that one\nmore component of the Fe II lines is arising from\nthe VBLR. Note here that, due to the complex\nFe II template, we assumed only one component\nfor each Fe II line (see Sect. 2.2). The reasonable fits of the Fe II shelf indicate that, the VBLR\ncomponent of Fe II should be significantly weaker\nthan the ILR one.\nThese indications are also supported by the correlation between the shift of the Fe II lines and\nthe ILR components of H\u03b1 and H\u03b2. The distribution of the Fe II line shifts is shown in Figure 16.\nThe shift is obtained with respect to the transition wavelength (Figure 16, left) and with respect\nto the narrow lines (Figure 16, right). We found\nthat Fe II lines are slightly redshifted, which is\nin agreement with the results of Hu et al. (2008a).\nBut in this case, the average value of the Fe II shift\nrelative to the transition wavelength is 270 \u00b1 180\nkms\u22121 , while the average value of the Fe II shift\nwith respect to the narrow lines is 100\u00b1240 kms\u22121 .\nThis implies a significantly smaller redshift than\nfound in Hu et al. (2008a). A slightly redshifted\nFe II emission may indicate that Fe II lines arise\nin an inflowing region (see Gaskell 2009).\n\nLocation of the Fe II emitting region\n4.3.\n\nMarziani & Sulentic (1993) and Popovi\u0107 et al.\n(2004) noted earlier that Fe II lines may originate\nin the intermediate-line region, which may be the\ntransition from the torus to the BLR. Recently,\nother authors also found that the optical Fe II\nemission may arise from a region in the outer parts\nof the BLR or several times larger than the H\u03b2 one\n(Hu et al. 2008a; Kuehn et al. 2008; Popovi\u0107 et al.\n2004, 2007, 2009; Gaskell et al. 2007).\nTo explore the kinematics of the Fe II emitting region, which may indicate the location of the\nFe II emission, we compared the derived widths\nand shifts of the Fe II and the H\u03b2 and H\u03b1 components. As can be seen in Figure 14 and Figure\n15, there is an indication that Fe II emitting region is located as the IL-emitting region. Moreover, the correlation between the Doppler widths\nof the Fe II and IL regions is significantly higher\nthan for the VBLR and NLR. There is no significant correlation between the Doppler widths of\nthe Fe II and NL regions (r = 0.01, P = 0.87\nfor H\u03b1, r = 0.05, P = 0.40 for H\u03b2), but there\n\nEW Fe II vs.\ncorrelation\n\nEW [O III] anti-\n\nOne of the problems mentioned in the introduction is the anti-correlation between the equivalent\nwidths of the [O III] and Fe II lines which is related\nto EV1 in the analysis of Boroson & Green (1992).\nSome physical causes proposed to explain Eigenvector 1 correlations are: (a) Eddington ratio\nL/LEdd (Boroson & Green 1992; Baskin & Laor\n2004), (b) black hole mass MBH , and (c) inclination angle (Miley & Miller 1979; Wills & Browne\n1986; Marziani et al. 2001). Wang et al. (2006)\nalso suggested that EV1 may be related to AGN\nevolution.\nTo try to understand the EW Fe II vs. EW\n[O III] anti-correlation, we examined its relationship to continuum luminosity and redshift (see\nSec 3.4, Table 11). We found an anti-correlation\nbetween the EW [O III]/EW Fe II ratio and\nL\u03bb5100 . Also, we examined the relations of equivalent widths of Fe II and [O III] lines vs. L\u03bb5100 .\nWe confirmed a strong Baldwin effect for [O III]\n12\n\n\fstronger than correlations of the same quantities\nwith L\u03bb5100 . This implies that inverse Baldwin effect of Fe II may be governed first of all by an\nevolutionary effect. This result is in agreement\nwith results of Green et al. (2001).\n\nlines, and an inverse Baldwin effect for EW Fe II\nlines, i.e. we found that as continuum luminosity\nincreases, EW Fe II also increases, but EW [O III]\ndecreases. This implies that the EW Fe II - EW\n[O III] anti-correlation may be influenced by Baldwin effect for [O III] and an inverse Baldwin effect\nfor Fe II lines. Also, in our analysis we found\nthat the strength of the Baldwin effect depends\non the H\u03b2 FWHM of the sample (see Table 11).\nNote that H\u03b2 FWHM is one of the parameters\nin Eigenvector 1. As it is mentioned in the introduction (Sec 1), some indications of connection\nbetween Baldwin effect and EV1 have been given\nin Baskin & Laor (2004) and Dong et al. (2009).\nLudwig et al. (2009) found that the significance of\nthe EV1 relationships is a strong function of continuum luminosity, i.e., the relationships between\nEW Fe II, EW [O III] and H\u03b2 FWHM can be detected only in a high-luminosity sample of AGNs\n(log\u03bbL5100 > 44.7), as well as a Baldwin effect for\n[O III] lines7\nThe origin of the Baldwin effect is still not understood and is a matter of debate. The increase\nof the continuum luminosity may cause a decrease\nof the covering factor, or changes in the spectral energy distribution (softening of the ionizing\ncontinuum) which may result in the decrease of\nEWs. The inclination angle may also be related to\nBaldwin effect (for review see Green et al. 2001).\nThe physical properties which are usually considered as a primary cause of the Baldwin effect are:\nMBH (Warner et al. 2003; Xu et al. 2008), L/L\u2299\n(Boroson & Green 1992; Baskin & Laor 2004),\nand changes in gas metalicity (Dietrich et al.\n2002). Also, a connection between Baldwin effect\nand AGN evolution is possible (see Green et al.\n2001).\nWe investigated if the correlations observed between L\u03bb5100 and the equivalent widths of the lines\n(as well as EW [O III] vs. EW Fe II) are primarily\ncaused by evolution. Since continuum luminosity\nis strongly correlated with cosmological redshift\nin our sample, it is difficult to separate luminosity\nfrom evolutionary effect. The exception are correlations of EW Fe II vs. z, as well as the ratio EW\nH\u03b2total /EW Fe II vs. z, which are significantly\n7\n\n5.\n\nConclusions\n\nIn this paper we have investigated characteristic of the Fe II emission region, using the sample of 302 AGN from SDSS. To analyze the Fe II\nemission, an Fe II template was constructed by\ngrouping the strongest Fe II multiplets into three\ngroups, according to the atomic properties of transitions.\nWe have investigated the correlations of these\nFe II groups and their ratios with other lines in\nspectra. In this way, we tried to find some physical\nconnection between the Fe II and other emitting\nregions, as well as to connect Fe II atomic structure with the physical properties of the emitting\nplasma.\nWe also investigated the kinematical connection\nbetween Fe II and the Balmer emission region. In\nparticular the anti-correlation of EW Fe II \u2013 EW\n[O III] and its possible connection with AGN luminosity and evolution were analzed. From our\ninvestigation we can outline the following conclusions:\n1. We have proposed here an optical Fe II template for the \u03bb\u03bb4400-5500 \u00c5 range, which\nconsists of three groups of Fe II multiplets,\ngrouped according to the lower terms of\ntransitions (F , S and G), and an additional\ngroup of lines reconstructed from the I Zw\n1 spectrum. We found that template can\nsatisfactorily fit the Fe II lines. In spectra\nin which Fe II emission lines have different\nrelative intensities than in I Zw 1, this template fit better than empirical and theoretical templates based on I Zw 1 spectrum (see\nmore in Appendix B). Using this template,\nwe are able to consider different groups of\ntransitions which contribute to the blue, central and red part of Fe II shelf around the\nH\u03b2+[O III] lines.\n\nThe majority of objects in our sample have continuum\nluminosities in the range 44.5 <log\u03bbL5100 < 46 range (see\nFig 2).\n\n2. We find that the ratios of different parts of\nthe iron shelf (F/G, F/S, and G/S) depend\n\n13\n\n\fof some spectral properties such as: continuum luminosity, H\u03b2 FWHM, shift of Fe II,\nand H\u03b1/H\u03b2 flux ratio. Also, it is noticed\nthat spectra with H\u03b2 FWHM greater and\nless than \u223c3000 kms\u22121 have different properties which is reflected in significantly different coefficients of correlation between the\nparameters.\n\nthe [O III] lines. Since EW Fe II increases,\nand EW [O III] decreases with increases of\ncontinuum luminosity (and also the trend\nof decreasing of EW [O III]/EW Fe II ratio with luminosity is obvious), the observed\nEW Fe II vs. EW [O III] anti-correlation\nis probably due to the same physical reason\nwhich causes the Baldwin effect. Moreover,\nit is observed that the coefficients of correlation due to Baldwin effect depend on H\u03b2\nFWHM range of a sub-sample, which also\nimplies the connection between the Baldwin effect and EV1. A decreasing trend is\nobserved for EW [O III]/EW H\u03b2 vs. continuum luminosity.\n\n3. We found that the Fe II emission is mainly\ncharacterized with a random velocity of\n\u223c1400 kms\u22121 that corresponds to the ILR\norigin, which is also supported by the significant correlation between the width of\nFe II and H\u03b1, H\u03b2 ILR widths. This is\nin agreement with the previous investigations (Popovi\u0107 et al. 2004; Hu et al. 2008a;\nKuehn et al. 2008), but unlike the earlier\ninvestigations, we found a slight correlation\nwith the width of VBLR. Therefore, it is\npossible that Fe II is partly produced in the\nVBLR and cannot be resolved from continuum luminosity. Also, we found that the\nFe II lines are slightly redshifted relative to\nthe narrow lines (\u223c 100 kms\u22121 ) (see Figure\n16).\n\n6. We found that the equivalent width of the\nFe II lines, as well as the EW H\u03b2total /EW\nFe II ratio have a stronger correlation with\nredshift, than with continuum luminosity.\nThis implies that the inverse Baldwin effect\nof Fe II may be primarily caused by evolution.\n\nThis work is a part of the projects (146002):\n\"Astrophysical\nSpectroscopy of Extragalactic Ob4.

Gaskell for very useful comments and suggestions.\n\n15\n\n\fA.\n\nThe sample selection\n\nUsing an SQL search with requirements mentioned in Sec 2.1, we obtained 497 AGN spectra with broad\nemission lines. From that number, 188 spectra were rejected because of noise in the iron emission line region.\nAn example of rejected spectrum is shown in Figure 21. Also, three spectra were rejected because of bad\npixels, and one because of very strong double-peak emission in H\u03b2 (SDSS J154213.91+183500.0).\nThree more spectra with broad H\u03b2 and practically without the Fe II emission were rejected since it\nwas not possible to fit the Fe II lines (SDSS J132756.15+111443.6, SDSS J104326.47+110524.2 and SDSS\nJ083343.47+074654.5). These three spectra are shown in Figure 22. There is also a possibility that in\nthese three objects the Fe II lines are very broad and weak so that they cannot be distinguished from the\ncontinuum emission.\nThe sample contains 302 AGN spectra (table with the SDSS identification and obtained parameters from\nthe best fit is available electronically only, as an additional file at http://www.aob.rs/\u223cjkovacevic/table.txt).\nTo test the host galaxy contribution in the selected sample of 302 AGNs, we have compared our sample\nwith the set of AGNs which host galaxy fraction is determined in Vanden Berk et al. (2006). We found 106\ncommon objects. In the case of 48 AGNs (45% of the sample) there is practically no host galaxy contribution\n(0%), and in the rest of the objects, the contribution of the host galaxy is mainly smaller than 20%.\n\nB.\n\nComparison with other Fe II templates\n\nWe compared two Fe II templates (one empirical and one theoretical) with our template. The empirical Fe II template was taken from Dong et al. (2008) using 46 broad and 95 narrow lines identified by\nVeron-Cetty et al. (2004) in the I Zw 1 spectrum within a \u03bb\u03bb4400-5500 \u00c5 range. The Fe II lines were\nfit with 6 free parameters (the width, shift and intensity for narrow and the width, shift and intensity\nfor broad lines). We also considered the theoretical model from Bruhweiler & Verner (2008) calculated for\nlog[nH /(cm\u22123 )]=11, [\u03be]/(1 km s\u22121 )=20 and log[\u03a6H /(cm\u22122 s\u22121 )]=21, since we found that this gave the best\nfit for those values of physical parameters. With this model, Fe II lines were fit with 3 free parameters\n(width, shift and intensity).\nFigure 23 shows the spectrum of SDSS J020039.15-084554.9, an object in which the iron lines have\nsimilar relative intensities to I Zw 1. We fit that spectrum with our template (a), with a template based\non line intensities from I Zw 1 (Dong et al. 2008) (b) and with a template calculated by CLOUDY code\n(Bruhweiler & Verner 2008) (c). We found that for this object all three templates fit the iron lines well.\nIn the case of the SDSS J141755.54 + 431155.8, however (Figure 24), the iron lines in the blue bump\nare slightly stronger compared to those in the red, and our model fit iron emission slightly better than the\nother two templates. The discrepancy between the blue and red Fe II bumps is especially emphasized in\nthe spectrum of the object SDSS J111603.13 + 020852.2 (Figure 25), which makes a significant difference for\ncomparison with the Fe II properties of I Zw 1 object. In this case, our template shows a small disagreement\nfor the lines whose relative intensity is taken from I Zw 1, but other two models, cannot fit well this type of\nthe Fe II emission. Disagreement is particularly strong in the blue bump (i.e., in the multiplets 37 and 38 of\nthe F group).\n\nC.\n\nThe relative intensities of Fe II lines\n\nTo estimate the relative intensities of Fe II lines within the three groups, we stated that the intensity\nof a line (m \u2192 n) should be proportional to the number of emitters (Nm )(Osterbrock 1989; Griem 1997),\nRl\nmn\ni.e. for optically thin plasma (for Fe II lines) one can write: Imn = const * A\n\u03bbmn 0 Nm dx, where Amn is the\nprobability of the transition, \u03bbmn is the transition wavelength, and l is the depth of the emitting region.\nOf course, the density of emitters can be non-uniform across the region, but we can approximate here that\n\n16\n\n\fit is uniform, and in the case of non-thermodynamical equilibrium it could be written (Osterbrock 1989):\nNm \u223c b(T, Ne )gm exp (\u2212Emn /kT ),\nwhere b(T,Ne ) represents deviation from thermodynamical equilibrium. In the case of lines which have the\nsame lower level, one may approximate the ratio as (Griem 1997):\nb1 (T, Ne ) \u03bb2 3 f1 g1 \u2212(E1\u2212E2)/kT\nI1\n=\n*\n*e\n( )\nI2\nb2 (T, Ne ) \u03bb1 f2 g2\nAssuming that\n\nb1 (T,Ne )\nb2 (T,Ne )\n\n\u2248 1 we obtained Eq. (1) for estimation of line ratios within one group.\n\n17\n\n(C1)\n\n\fDong, X., Wang, J., Wang, T., Wang,\nH., Fan, X., Zhou, H., Yuan, W. 2009,\n2009arXiv0903.5020D\n\nREFERENCES\nAbazajian, K.N. et al. 2009, ApJS, 182, 543A\nBaldwin, J.
