Making use\nof a virtual two-photon process, our scheme achieves maximally entangled states without any real\ntransitions of atomic internal states, hence it is immune to the atomic decay.\nPACS number(s):03.67.Lx, 32.80.Wr, 42.50.-p\n\nEntanglement is one of the most characteristic features\nof quantum systems and lies at the heart of the difference\nbetween the quantum and classical multi-particle world.\nIt is the phenomenon that enables quantum information\nprocessing and computing [1]. Beyond these and other\nrelated applications, complex entangled states, such as\nthe GHZ triplets of particles [2] can be used for tests of\nquantum non-locality [3]. Moreover, the relaxation dynamics of larger entangled states sheds light on the decoherence process and on the quantum-classical boundary\n[4]. There are a lot of proposal devoted to the preparation of quantum entangled states, among them the idea\nfor photon down-conversion process [3], with trapped ions\n[5], for cavity quantum electrodynamics [6], with macroscopic objects [7] or for an optical fibre [8] has been realized experimentally.\n\nfective non-linear interaction between the two modes can\nbe established. By making use of the virtual two-photon\nprocess, our new protocol significantly reduces the effect\nof atomic spontaneous emission during the entanglement\npreparation process.\nOur system consists of two optical cavities as in Ref.\n[23] and an atom system surrounded by the two optical\ncavities. The axis of the two cavities are perpendicular\neach to other, the internal structure of the atom is depicted in Figure 1,\n\nIn the latter case, the entanglement results from the\nnonlinear interaction between the two modes in an optical fibre. This is closely connected to the recent advance of enhancing nonlinear coupling via electromagnetically induced transparency(EIT) mechanism [9]. Measured value of the \u03c7(3) parameter are up to six order of\nmagnitude larger than usual [10]. This has opened the\ndoor toward the application of this kind of nonlinear process to quantum information processing even for the very\nlow photon-number case [11]. In fact, there are several\nproposals for exploiting huge Kerr non-linearities to perform computation and quantum teleportation [12,13] or\nfor quantum non-demolition measurements [14]. Apart\nfrom the Kerr nonlinearity, the experimental achievement\nof atomic Bose-Einstein condensation(BEC) also provide\nus a chance to create many particle entanglement with\nnonlinear interactions [15\u201322]. All these show that the\nnon-linear interaction between different quantum modes\nis a valuable resource for quantum information processing.\nIn this paper, we present a new theoretical scheme for\nentangling two quantum modes in two high-Q optical\ncavities.

Both cavity fields are detuned from atomic resonance by \u2206 = \u03a9 \u2212 \u03c9i , and \u03b4 = 2\u03a9 \u2212 \u03c9e .\n\nnian (2) then takes the following form in the interaction\npicture\n\nThe atom is assumed to make two-photon transitions\nof frequency \u03c9e between the nondegenerate state |gi with\nenergy \u03c9g = 0 and the excited state |ei. The transitions\nare mediated by two intermediate degenerate levels |i1 i\nand |i2 i (with energy \u03c9i ): the frequencies for transitions\n|gi \u2190\u2192 |i1 i(or|i2 i) and |i1 i(or|i2 i) \u2190\u2192 |ei are \u03a9 \u2212 \u2206\nand \u03a9 + \u2206 \u2212 \u03b4, respectively. With these notations, the\nsystem can be described by\n\nHef f = h\u0304\n\n+ h\u0304gc (|gihi1 |a\u2020 + |i1 ihe|a\u2020 + h.c.)\n+ h\u0304gc (|gihi2 |b\u2020 + |i2 ihe|b\u2020 + h.c.)\n(1)\n\nwhere a(b) and a\u2020 (b\u2020 ) are the annihilation and creation\noperator for the cavity mode a(b) with frequency \u03a9a (\u03a9b ),\nrespectively, gc is the coupling constant of the atom to\nthe cavity mode a(b) driving the transition |gi \u2190\u2192 |i1 i\nor |i1 i \u2190\u2192 |ei ( |gi \u2190\u2192 |i2 i or |i2 i \u2190\u2192 |ei ). We\nwill not consider the position dependance of the cavityatom coupling gc (~r), a good approximation in the LambDicke limit. For the reason of simplicity, we assume\n\u03a9a = \u03a9b = \u03a9 hereafter. Our Scheme works in the following limit: 1)Both the cavity mode a and b are strong detuned, i.e., \u2206 = \u03a9\u2212\u03c9i >> gc , \u2206 >> \u03b4 and \u03b4 >> |gc |2 /\u2206;\nand 2) the cavity decay rete \u03ba << |gc |2 /\u2206 as required\nfor the high-Q optical cavity. Because these transitions\n|gi \u2190\u2192 |i1 i , |i1 i \u2190\u2192 |ei , |gi \u2190\u2192 |i2 i and |i2 i \u2190\u2192 |ei\ndriven by the two cavity modes are far off-resonant, we\nmay adiabatically eliminate the intermediate states |i1 i\nand |i2 i independently, the Hamiltonian (1) then takes\nthe following form [24,25]\nH = h\u0304\u03c9a\u2020 a + h\u0304\u03c9b\u2020 b + h\u0304\u03bb(|gihe|a\u20202 + |eihg|a2 )\n\u03c9A\n+\n(|eihe| \u2212 |gihg|)\n2\n+ h\u0304\u03bb(|gihe|b\u20202 + |eihg|b2 ),\n2\n\n(3)\n\nin derivation of the Hamiltonian (3), the atom in its\nground state |gi initially is assumed. The two mode\nstates will be defined in terms of the usual two-mode\nFock states |m, ni = |mia \u2297 |nib with m(n) photons in\nmode a(b). First we consider a simple case that there are\nonly two photons in the mode a while the cavity mode b\nin vacuum initially. The Hamiltonian (3) for this simple\ncase is equivalent to\n\nH = h\u0304\u03a9a a\u2020 a + h\u0304\u03a9b b\u2020 b\n\n+ h\u0304\u03c9i |i1 ihi1 | + h\u0304\u03c9e |eihe| + h\u0304\u03c9i |i2 ihi2 |,\n\n|\u03bb|2 \u20202 2\n(a a + b\u20202 b2 + a\u20202 b2 + b\u20202 a2 ),\n\u03b4\n\nHef f = 2h\u0304\n\n|\u03bb|2\n(|Eia hE| + |Eib hE| + \u03c3a+ \u03c3b\u2212 + \u03c3a\u2212 \u03c3b+ ),\n\u03b4\n\n+(\u2212)\n\nis the\nwith definition |Eix = |2ix , (x = a, b), and \u03c3x\npauli operator for mode x. It shows that after the interaction time T0 = \u03b4\u03c0/8|\u03bb|2 , the two cavity modes evolve\nto a maximal entangled state \u221a12 (|0Ei+|E0i) while leave\nthe atom in its ground state |gi. We would like to note\nthat the non-linear interaction term [a\u20202 b2 +h.c.] is different from the Kerr nonlinear interaction a\u20202 a2 and a\u2020 ab\u2020 b\n[29,30], as the latter one is in the form of the square of\nthe free Hamiltonian, and hence either a\u2020 a or b\u2020 b is a\nconstant of motion.\nWe have performed extensive numerical simulations\nwith the full Hamiltonian Eq. (1). Ignoring the atomic\nspontaneous emission and the cavity decay, we find the\nabove analytical insights to be completely accurate, i.e.,\nwe indeed get the maximal entangled state (see Figure\n2). In fact, we find that the approximated Hamiltonian\nEq.(3) is quite an good approach to the full Hamiltonian\nEq.(1).\n\n(2)\n\n2\n\nc|\n, \u03c9A = \u03c9e \u2212 \u03c9g .\nwith \u03c9 = \u03a9 + 2 |g\u2206c| , \u2206 = \u03a9 \u2212 \u03c9i , \u03bb = |g\u2206\nThis is the Hamiltonian which is broadly used to describe\nthe two-photon process, and has received an extensive\nstudy during the last decades. For instance, the experimental realization of a two-photon cascade micromaser\n[26], the generation of Squeezing amplification [27] and\nthe creation of entangled states [28]. Our proposal works\nwith a new mechanism different from that by making\nuse of very high Kerr coupling, the coupling between the\ntwo cavity modes in our protocol, to be discussed below,\nresults from virtual two-photon processes.\nIn the limit \u03b4 >> \u03bb, i.e., (2\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9A ) >> |gc |2 /\u2206, the\ntwo-photon process is on off-resonance, we may adiabatically eliminate the atom from the system, the Hamilto-\n\nThe top panel in Figure 2 shows selected results for the\ndependance of the population of state |0, 2i(dotted line)\nand |2, 0i (dashed line) on time, while the lower panel\ndisplay the von Neumann entropy taken in base 2.

As\nwith any proposal for quantum information processing,\nultimately its success depends on being able to complete\nmany coherent dynamics during the decoherence time.\n2\n2\nIn principle, as long as a) \u03bb\u03b4 >> \u03ba and b) \u03bb\u03b4 >> \u0393, we\ncould expect essentially the same results as illustrated\nin Figure 2 and Figure 3. As there are no real transitions of atomic states in our proposal, it makes this\nscheme immune to the atomic spontaneous emission or\natomic decay, so the restriction b) make no sense in this\nscheme. On the other hand, the condition a) is difficult\nto achieved because the two-photon process is relatively\nweak due to large off-resonant detunings for all its intermediate states. In Figure 6 and Figure 7, the effects of\ncavity decay on dynamics of the proposed system is illustrated. As known, the decoherence time for a state |m, ni\ndepends on the total number of photons, and as Figure 6\nand Figure 7 show, relative good results are found when\nthe cavity loss rate \u03ba is small.\n\nc\n\n0.5\n\nb\n0\n0\n\na\n500\n\n1000\n\n1500\n\n2000\n\n1500\n\n2000\n\nTime [1/ g]\n\nEntropy\n\n2\n1.5\n1\n0.5\n0\n0\n\n500\n\n1000\n\nTime [1/ g]\n\nFIG. 3.

As an example, in Figure 4 and Figure\n5, we display results for \u2206 = 8g, \u03b4 = 3g.

As all existing cavity QED-based quantum\ncomputation protocols, optical cavity with high-Q and\natom with small decay rate remain challenging because\nof the technological limit of the Fabry-Perot optical cavity [32\u201335].\nIn conclusion, we have proposed a new protocol for\npreparing the maximally entangled state in two high-Q\noptical cavities. As the photons act as the information\ncarrier, cavity with very high-Q factor is highly desired.\nWe have explained the scheme in terms of the virtual\ntwo-photon process induced nonlinear interaction. In\naddition, our protocol can also be explained in terms of\nentanglement distribution by separable states [36]. This\nnew protocol has advantages that its successful implementation involves no real transitions of atomic states, it\nmakes this proposal immune to the atomic spontaneous\nemission or atomic decay.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENT:\n4\n\n\f[34] A.
