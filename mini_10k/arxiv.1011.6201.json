In practice, particularly in data analysis on the CMB, however, one often\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\nencounters the well known and rather unique issue, namely we can do statistical analysis\non only one version of the celestial sphere using an ergodic hypothesis. For example, the\nangular power spectrum of the temperature anisotropies Cl \u2261 halm a\u2217lm i, but with one version\nP\nof the sphere it can be estimated with only 2l + 1 modes: Cl est = (2l + 1)\u22121 lm=\u2212l alm a\u2217lm .\nLack of a statistical ensemble thus induces in power spectrum analysis the uncertainty called\n\"cosmic variance\" (White, Krauss and Silk 1993). Another issue arising from lack of an ensemble is coined \"cosmic covariance\", which refers to a non-zero chance correlation between\nthe CMB and the foregrounds (Chiang, Naselsky and Coles 2009). The cosmic covariance\nis the source of error in employing quadratic minimization for separating the CMB and the\nforegrounds (Bennett et al. 2003; Hinshaw et al. 2007).\nIn this paper we address another issue in cross-power spectrum arising from lack of\nan ensemble. Cross-power spectrum is useful in eliminating uncorrelated signal and is thus\ncommonly used in power spectrum estimation from multifrequency measurement of CMB. It\nis required, however, to have an ensemble of modes in the summation to completely eliminate\nthe uncorrelated signal. Therefore lack of an ensemble of modes results in residual (hence\nerror) in the cross-power spectrum.\nAnother important issues related to extraction of the power spectrum of CMB temperature anisotrpies is the calibration of window function convolving the signal, which is usually\nby measuring Jupiter (Page et al. 2003). It can also be via measuring bright extragalactic\npoint sources as they are manifestation of the window function as well, albeit with background CMB and instrument noise. We can then employ cross-power spectrum on pairs of\nextragalactic point sources from different patches of the sky, where the background CMB\nand other signals are uncorrelated and can be largely eliminated.\nThis paper is arranged as follows. In Section 2 we examine the limit of cross-power\nspectrum as a quadratic estimator. We in Section 3 employ the estimator on a pair of\nsimulated point sources to obtain the window function. In Section 4 we put this method\nto the test on WMAP Difference Assembly (DA) maps whose window functions are already\ncarefully calibrated via measuring Jupiter and we extract the window functions of WMAP\nfrequency band maps. The conclusion and discussion is in Section 5.\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\n2.\n\nCross-power spectrum and its limit\n\nCross-power spectrum (XPS) is a quadratic estimator between two maps j and j \u2032 , and\non a sphere it is written as\nl\nX\n1\njj \u2032\nXl =\nj\u2217 j\u2032 ,\n(1)\n2l + 1 m=\u2212l lm lm\n\n\u2032\nwhere jlm and jlm\nare the spherical harmonic coefficients of the two maps, and \u2217 denotes\ncomplex conjugate (Hinshaw et al. 2003). In order for the XPS to be real, the usual practice\n\u2217\n\u2032\nis by replacing the jlm\njlm\nin Eq.(1) with\n\u2217\n\u2032\n\u2032\u2217\n\u2032\n(jlm\njlm\n+ jlm\njlm )/2 \u2261 |jlm ||jlm\n| cos \u2206\u03c6lm ,\n\n(2)\n\n\u2032\nwhere \u2206\u03c6lm is the phase difference between jlm and jlm\n. The advantage of XPS as an\nunbiased quadratic estimator for power spectrum estimation lies in the fact that XPS returns\nP\nwith its usual power spectrum m |jlm |2 if j and j \u2032 are of the same signal, and if, on the other\nhand, j and j \u2032 are uncorrelated then \u2206\u03c6lm is distributed uniformly random in [0, 2\u03c0] and\nP\n\u2032\nthus h lm=\u2212l |jlm ||jlm\n| cos \u2206\u03c6lm i = 0, where the angle brackets denote ensemble average.\nHence XPS is useful in eliminating uncorrelated signals while preserving the correlated one\nand has been employed by WMAP to extract CMB spectrum by crossing the Differencing\nAssemblies (DA) (Hinshaw et al. 2003, 2007; Nolta et al. 2009; Larson et al. 2010) .\nIn practice, however, one does not have a statistical ensemble and the capability of XPS\nto extract the underlying power spectrum from correlated signal depends on how much the\nuncorrelated signal is decreased with finite realizations and finite number of multipole modes\ninvolved in the summation at l.\n\nTake as an example extracting the CMB signal from WMAP data. The W1 and W2\nc\nW2\nDA have the same CMB but uncorrelated noise, so writing aW1\nlm = alm + nlm and alm =\nP\naclm +n\u2032lm , in XPS the correlated signal |aclm |2 is the desired one whereas those uncorrelated\n\u2032\n\u2032\nterms between CMB and noises Xl cn , Xl cn and between noises Xl nn shall be decreased but\nnevertheless not to zero, which is then the source of error in the XPS.\nIn order to examine the level of residual in XPS, we consider two Gaussian and uncor\u2032\nrelated maps j and j \u2032 , whose spherical harmonic coefficient jlm and jlm\nhave zero mean and\n\u2032\nvariance Jl and Jl respectively and the corresponding phase difference \u2206\u03c6lm is uniformly\nrandom in [0, 2\u03c0]. One should note that the distribution of Eq.(2) under this condition is a\nnormal product distribution, which is itself not Gaussian but can be expressed as\np\n\u0001\n4K0 |x| / Jl Jl\u2032\n\u2032 (x) =\np\npjlm jlm\n,\n(3)\n\u03c0 Jl Jl\u2032\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nwhere K0 is the zeroth-ordered modified Bessel function of the 2nd kind (Springer 1979).\nAlthough the distribution of the variable is not Gaussian, what we need to examine is its\nsummation. Since the XPS defined\nq in Eq.(2) can be either positive or negative, we look\n\ninstead at its root mean square h(Xl jj )2 i. Due to equal partiution on both perpendicular\ndirections of complex plane, it can be written:\nv *\nu\n2+\nq\nl\nu\nX\n1 t1\n\u2032\n\u2032\n,\n(4)\n| exp(i\u2206\u03c6lm )\n|jlm ||jlm\nh(Xl jj )2 i =\n2l + 1 2 m=\u2212l\n\u2032\n\nthe right hand side of which is closely related to a two-dimensional random walk. Random\nwalk statistics is employed as a Gaussianity test on CMB (Naselsky et al. 2005; Stannard\n& Coles 2005). Recall that the celebrated Pearson's random walk is a 2D isotropic random\nP\nwalk with equal step-length, expressed in the complex plane r =\nk |dk | exp(i\u03c6k ) where\n|dk | = d. The pdf of the resultant displacement r \u2261 |r| after l steps has the form\n\u0013\n\u0012\n1\nr2\np(r) =\n(5)\nexp \u2212 2 ,\n\u03c0ld2\nld\nfrom which hr 2i = ld2 . Pearson's walk can be generalized to unequal step-length and it can\nbe shown (Pearson 1905; Rayleigh 1905) that when l is large and the mean-square step\nP\nlength is known : (l)\u22121 l |dk |2 = d2 , the pdf for the displacement has the same form as\n\u2032\nEq.(5) (Hughes 1995). For unequal step length |dk | = |jlm ||jlm\n|, the ensembled-average\n2 \u2032 2\n\u2032\nsquare step length is then h|jlm | |jlm | i = Jl Jl , so the mean square displacement of the\nP\n\u2032\nrandom walk h| lm=\u2212l |jlm ||jlm\n| exp(i\u2206\u03c6lm )|2 i = (2l + 1)Jl Jl\u2032 . Note that in driving the\nresult we only assume j and j \u2032 are Gaussian, so they can be either white noise (with flat\npower spectrum) or others whose power spectrum has scale dependence. In any case, we can\nwrite\nq\n\u2032\nh(Xl jj )2 i\n1\np\n.\n(6)\n= p\n\u2032\nJl Jl\n2 l + 1/2\nThe decreasing of the \"junk\" is inversely proportional\n\u221a to the square root of the number of\nrandom walk, and it can be further decreased by 1/ LN with binning L \u2261 \u2206l multipole\nnumbers and averaging from N sets of XPS. We demonstrate Eq.(6) in Fig.1 by plotting\nXl from two white-noise\nmaps. One can see the the decreasing of the power spectrum\np\nproportional to (2 l + 1/2)\u22121 . Note that Xl is jumping either postively or negatively and\nonly positive points are plotted.\n\nKnowing the residual of the junk from XPS, we can estimate its capability in extracting\nCMB. In crossing N pairs of maps containing CMB with the same noise level, we assume\nthe CMB power spectrum is Cl \u2243 Al\u22122 and the instrument noise level is Nl = RA where\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\n\nFig. 1.- Demonstration of Eq.(6). The black dots denote XPS from two white noise maps\nwith unity power spectrum, whereas the larger dots are the average\npairs of white\np from 200\n\u22121\nnoise\nwith L \u2261 \u2206l = 50. The upper line is (2 l + 1/2) and the lower\np maps, binned\n\u22121\n(2 LN(l + 1/2)) , where L = 50 and N = 200. Note that the negative values are not\nplotted.\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nR indicates the noise level relative to the CMB and R \u226a 1\u221a1 . The residual level from\ncn\nnn\u2032\n\u22121/2\nbetween CMB and noise, and between noises are 2X\u221a\n\u2243 A R(l3 LN)\nand\nX\n\u2243\nl\nl\n\u221a\ncn\n\u22121/2\nRA(4lLN)\n, respectively. They intersect\np at l \u2243 2/ R. For l2 < 2/ R, Xl is the main\ncn\nc\nresidual with contribution: 2Xl /Cl \u2243 Rl/LN , and LN > l R in order for the residual\ncontribution\nto be within cosmic variance, which shall be the case as long as\npLN \u2265 4. For\n\u221a\nl \u2265 2/ R, on the other hand, the residual in the CMB extraction is R l3 /4LN, and\nbeyond l = (4LN/R2 )1/3 the residual level is higher than the CMB, thereby XPS fails.\nFor a more realistic situation, where the XPS is employed on signals that is convolved\nwith window function: Al\u22122 exp(\u2212B 2 l2 ), we plot in Fig.2 the upper limit of R (the noise\nlevel) if the XPS is to retrieve the CMB at the corresponding multipole number. The different\nFWHM are chosen according to those from channels of ESA Planck Surveyor. As expected,\nmore binning and more sets of XPS shall retrieve higher modes for the same noise level.\nIn Figure 3 we show the XPS (dots) from two simulated maps. Top panel shows Gaussian\nrandom signal with power spectrum Cl = 104 l\u22122 (\u03bcK2 ) convolved with beam FWHM 30\narcmin in both maps, the theoretical power spectrum of which is shown in dash-dot curve.\nThey are added with pixel (white) noise signals with differnt levels Nl = 10\u22121 and Nl\u2032 =\n10\u22123 (\u03bcK2 ). The residual from XPS (i.e. Eq.(6)) is plotted in dash line. Note that the\np\nresidual in employing XPS on maps with different noise levels is proportional to Nl Nl\u2032 ,\nwhich reflects the real situation of crossing between different frequency bands such as WMAP\nV and W band. In bottom panel we simulate 4 WMAP W channel DA maps, convolving\nwith beam FWHM 12 arcmin before adding WMAP simulated noise. There are 6 XPS and\nthe binned (\u2206l = 10) retrieved power spectrum is denoted with plus sign. One can see the\nresidual from the noise is the main error from XPS, even if it's not white noise.\n\n3.\n\nApplication of cross power spectrum\n\nOne of the applications of XPS is to retrieve window function from bright extragalactic\npoint sources. The standard way of measuring the window function in CMB experiments is\nvia measuring planets such as Jupiter (Page et al. 2003; Hill et al. 2009).\nThe importance of window function can be illustrated in the following simple example.\nThe final step of CMB power spectrum estimate often involves deconvolution as the retrieved\nsingal (either via ILC method or foreground template fitting) is also convolved with a com1\n\nThe noise level Nl = RA is related to noise fluctuation \u03c3 2 through \u03c3 2 = Npix RA/4\u03c0, where Npix is the\ntotal pixel number of the map.\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\n\n5'\nR\n\nFWHM = 33'\n\n24'\n\n14'\n\n10'\n\n7'\n\nFig. 2.- The upper limit of R, which corresponds to the instrument noise level, for the XPS\nto be able to successfully retrieve the CMB at the corresponding multipole number.

An error in deconvolution scale \u2206b produces an error in the\npower \u2206(\u03b4Tl2 ) = 2b \u2206b l(l + 1)\u03b4Tl2 , so, for example, deconvolution with 1\u25e6 FWHM on a\nsmoothed map by 59\u2032 (i.e. overestimated by a mere 1 arcmin) shall overestimate the power\n2\n2\nat first Doppler peak by \u2206(\u03b4T220\n)/\u03b4T220\n\u2243 8.9% and the error goes with \u223c l2 for higher\nl. Although in practice deconvolution involves estimating the inverse covariance matrix, it\ndemonstrate that the window function is one of the most crucial issue in CMB power spectrum estimation. The sensitivity of window function is also investigated in Sawangwit &\nShanks (2010).\nBased on flat-sky approximation and Fourier transform, we can estimate the window\nfunction from bright point sources by taking two square patches of sky where there is a bright\npoint source in the center: T1 (k) = \u03b1b(k) + c(k) + n(k), T2 (k) = \u03b2b(k) + c\u2032 (k) + n\u2032 (k),\nwhere k is the Fourier wavenumber, c, c\u2032 and n, n\u2032 represent different CMB(+foreground)\nand noise, respectively. The CMB and noise are not correlated in different parts of the sky\nso they are now the \"junk\" in XPS whereas the bright point sources each in the center of\nthe patches is manifestation of the inflight beam profile and thus are correlated signal. The\nP 2\nwindow function is then Wk =\nb (k) with a rescaling relation l = 2\u03c0k/L, where L is the\nsize of the patch.\nWe simulate full-sky CMB signal with WMAP best-fit \u039bCDM model on Planck 30 GHz\nchannel and add 2 bright point sources on different parts of the sky, which is then convolved\nwith beam 33 arcmin FWHM before adding noise with Nl = 10\u22122 \u03bcK2 . We extract 10\u25e6 \u00d7 10\u25e6\nwith the point source at the center. The point sources have amplitudes 40 and 46\u03c3, where \u03c3 2\nis the variance of the CMB. In Fig.4 we present the simulation and the retrieving capability\nof the window function. One can see that XPS extended the estimate more than 10 dB.\n\n4.\n\nWindow Functions of the WMAP Difference Assemly and Frequency Band\nMaps\n\nHaving demonstrated that the window function can be retrieved with XPS from simulated bright point sources, we now employ the same method on WMAP DA maps: K1, Ka1,\nQ1, Q2, V1, V2, W1\u2013W4. For each DA map, we extract the square patches where the top\n2 brightest point sources are in the center of the patche.\nCare has to be taken when one chooses the patch size. Fourier transform spreads the\nvariance of the map into the power of different wavelengths. For stationary noise, choosing\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\n\nFig. 3.- Demonstration of the XPS retriving power and its limit. Top panel shows XPS\n(dots) of two maps with input spectrum Cl = 104 l\u22122 (\u03bcK2 ) convolved with beam FWHM\n30 arcmin (dash-dot), but each added with different noise level (dotted): Nl = 10\u22121 and\n10\u22123 (\u03bcK2 ). Dash lines are the expected residual from XPS according to Eq.(6). Bottom\npanel shows binned (\u2206l = 10) power (plus sign) from average of 6 XPS of input WMAP\nbest-fit \u039bCDM convolved with W channel FWHM 12 arcmin (dash-dot), and added WMAP\nsimulated noise (dotted).\n\nFig. 4.- Retrieving window function from bright point sources via XPS. Top panel shows\nthe power spectra (solid red and blue curves) of 2 10\u25e6 \u00d7 10\u25e6 patches taken from a simulated\nfull-sky map of Planck 30 GHz channel. In both patches CMB and a bright point source\nlocated at the center are convolved with 33 arcmin FWHM. Dash-dot black curve denotes\nthe theoretical power spectrum of beam-convolved CMB from best-fit \u039bCDM model whereas\ndash-dot red and blue the point sources with amplitude 47\u03c3 and 40\u03c3, respectively, where\n\u03c3 2 is the variance of the CMB of the patch. Dotted line is the noise level 10\u22122 \u03bcK2 and\ndash green line is the expected residual of the XPS from noise. In bottom panel we show\nthe input window fucntion (solid curve) in dB and the retrieved window function (diamond\nsign), which is better than \u221235dB as indicated in green line on top panel.\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\ndifferent patch area : changing from L20 to L2 (with the same pixel size) shall shift the level\nof white spectrum by (L0 /L)2 as the variance is fixed. For a point source, on the other\nhand, changing the patch size has an extra effect on the variance by (L0 /L)2 , resulting in the\nlarge-scale power level of a point source being shifted by (L0 /L)4 . Hence, choosing a smaller\npatch (L < L0 ) enhances the relative power level of the point source to noise by (L0 /L)2 ,\nrendering a better profile of the window function.\nOne cannot, however, choose as small sizes as possible. The first multipole number\nto display the profile of the window function is decided by the size of the patch L via\nlfirst = 2\u03c0/L, so one loses the large-scale profile if the patch size is too small. Furthermore,\na fixed pixel size sets the maximum multipole number regardless of the patch size. So a\nsmaller patch with a fixed pixel size has fewer Fourier modes with spacing \u2206l = 2\u03c0/L.\nWe take the patch size L = 8, 5, 4, 3 and 3 degrees for K, Ka, Q, V and W band\nrespectively and show the XPS results of all 10 DA maps in Fig 6: solid curves are the\nwindow functions from WMAP DA maps and diamond sign denotes the retrieved window\nfunctions from XPS. One can see in Fig.5 that the XPS retrieves the window functions nicely,\nexcept for the W band 4 DA maps. The reason is that W band not only has the smallest\nbeam size, but also higher noise level than the other bands.\nAccording to the previous XPS DAs results, our method for retrieving window function\nfrom bright point sources is demonstrated useful. We can now retrieve the window functions\nof the WMAP frequency band maps. The WMAP frequency band maps, together with the\ncorresponding window functions, can be as useful as the DA maps in extracting the CMB\npower spectrum. The WMAP K, Ka, Q, V and W band have 1, 1, 2, 2 and 4 DA maps\nrespectively, and the frequency band maps are produced from combining the DA maps, thus\nthere is no direct measurement or estimation of the corresponding window functions for each\nmap. One should note that the window functions of the DA maps at the same frequency\nband do not necessarily have the same profile, which is particularly true for W band (e.g.\nsee W1 and W2 DA window functions in Fig.5).\nIn order to retrieve the window functions of the frequency band maps, we perform the\nsame procedure as that on the DA maps in the previous section by choosing the same patches\nof the sky and patch size for the corresponding band. The retrieved window functions are\nshowed in Fig.6, and for comparison, we put the window function profiles of the DA maps\nfor the corresponding band. Though there are 2 DA maps for Q and V band, the profiles\nare close to each other, and therefore one can see our retrieved window function for the\nfrequency band maps are close to that of DA maps'. For W band, however, the difference\nin DA maps is pronounced in that the retrieved W band window function is compared with\nthat of W1 DA map (solid curve) and W2 DA map (long dash). The profile of W3 and W4\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\nare not plotted as they are close to that of W2 and W1 respectively. One can see that the\nwindow function profile of the W frequency band map is close to that of W1 (and W4), not\nW2 (and W3).\n\n5.\n\nConclusion and Discussion\n\nIn this paper we discuss the limit of the widely-used XPS and we demonstrate that it\nhas the ability to decrease uncorrelated \"junk\" signal by a factor inversely proportional to\nthe square root of the number of modes involved in the summation. It indeed can decrease\nthe uncorrelated signal on small scales in the power spectrum, but has limited ability in\neliminiating that of large scales. We then employ XPS to retrieve window functions via\nextragalactic point sources. One of the crucial steps for estimating CMB power spectrum\nis to know about the window function that convolves the observed signal. In this case the\n\"junk\" signal is composed of CMB and pixel noise. We take WMAP DAs as test samples\nfirst and employ XPS on extragalactic bright point sources to extract window function. We\ndemonstrate it a useful method to extract window function without measuring planets for\nDAs. For frequency band maps combined from DA maps, we apply the same method to\nextract the window functions, which are unknown prior to our investigation. Our method\nwill be useful for the upcoming Planck data.\nWe acknowledge the use of Healpix 2 package (Gorski et al. 2005) and the use of\nGlesp 3 package.
