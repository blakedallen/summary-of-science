INTRODUCTION\n\nGravitational waves in inflationary cosmology are produced by sub-Hubble scale vacuum fluctuations. They are\nstretched to super-Hubble scales by inflationary expansion, and then they generate anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) (see, e.g., Grishchuk 1975, Mukhanov et al. 1992). Scales which re-enter before matterradiation equality will rapidly redshift (and suffer small damping during recombination), having negligible effect on\nCMB temperature anisotropies, while scales which re-enter later can affect the temperature anisotropies at large angles. Roughly speaking, we can approximate the impact of gravitational waves upon CMB temperature anisotropies\nby neglecting all local causal dynamics and treating the large-scale fluctuations as frozen beyond the Hubble scale\nuntil re-entry, where their amplitude is conserved and determined by the inflationary Hubble rate at the time of\nHubble-crossing. This picture is confirmed by the evolution equation (Lifshitz 1946)\nfij\u2032\u2032 + 2\n\na\u2032 \u2032\nf + k 2 fij = 0\na ij\n\nfor the Fourier modes of the transverse traceless tensor perturbation fij , defined (on a flat background) by\n\u0003\n\u0002\nds2 = a2 (\u03b7) \u2212d\u03b7 2 + (\u03b4ij + fij ) dxi dxj .\nEquation (1) shows that on very large scales, k/aH \u226a 1 (where H = a\u2032 /a2 ),\nZ\nd\u03b7\n,\nfij \u2248 Aij + Bij\na2\n\n(1)\n\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\n\u2032\nwhere A\u2032ij = 0 = Bij\n. If a\u2032 > 0 then the B-mode is decaying, and we have fij \u2248 constant, with the constant\ndetermined by the Hubble rate at inflationary Hubble-crossing, H(\u03b7c ) = k/a(\u03b7c ).\nThis simple picture is modified by small corrections induced at preheating. At the end of slow-roll inflation, the\ninflaton oscillates and transfers its energy to fluctuations, initiating the reheating era, which ends when created\nparticles thermalize as a radiative plasma. Reheating is often initiated by a preheating era, marked by coherent\ninflaton oscillations which drive parametric resonant amplification of scalar fluctuations (see, e.g., Traschen and\nBrandenberger 1990, Kofman et al. 1994, 1997). One crucial point about preheating is that, since the inflaton is\ncoherent on scales well beyond the Hubble horizon, it is in principle possible for super-Hubble fluctuations to be\namplified without violating causality (Bassett et al. 1999a,b).1 In the case of scalar fluctuations of the metric, this\ncan in principle produce nonlinear amplification, depending on initial conditions and coupling strengths (Bassett et\nal. 1999a,b,c, 2000, Ivanov 2000, Jedamzik and Sigl 2000, Liddle et al. 2000). While tensor fluctuations will not be\nstrongly amplified by scalar inflaton oscillations, these oscillations nevertheless could leave an imprint on the tensor\nspectrum on large scales. Such a possibility is usually ruled out on causality grounds, but no such causality constraint\noperates during coherent oscillations of the inflaton condensate.\n\n1\n\nIt is also possible for small-scale gravitational waves to be generated by gravitational bremstrahlung via rescattering of\nscalar fluctuations during preheating (Khlebnikov and Tkachev 1997). This is a particular example of the generation of tensor\nperturbations by scalar perturbations at second order (Matarrese et al. 1998).\n\n1\n\n\fThese small corrections will be carried into Eq. (1) via the scale factor, which inherits an oscillatory addition\nto its average value. However, the nature of the effect is more clearly brought out via an alternative description of\ngravitational waves, based on the idea that a full characterization requires the curvature tensor, not the metric (Pirani\n1957). Transverse traceless modes are given by the divergence-free electric and magnetic parts of the Weyl tensor\nE\u03bc\u03bd = C\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03b2 u\u03b1 u\u03b2 , H\u03bc\u03bd =\u2217 C\u03bc\u03b1\u03bd\u03b2 u\u03b1 u\u03b2 ,\nwhere u\u03bc is the background four-velocity (there are no velocity perturbations for tensor modes). This covariant\ndescription of gravitational waves was used by Hawking (1966), and is remarkably analogous to electromagnetic\nradiation theory (Dunsby et al. 1997, Maartens and Bassett 1998).\nIn this paper, we use the Maxwell-Weyl approach to gravitational waves to investigate the effects of inflaton\noscillations in some simple preheating models, generalizing previous work in Minkowski spacetime (Bassett 1997). In\nSections 2 and 3, we give the basic equations and their qualitative properties. In Section 4 we present the numerical\ncalculations, and Section 5 contains concluding remarks and discussion.\n\n2. BACKGROUND DYNAMICAL EQUATIONS\n\nThe background inflaton is governed by the Klein-Gordon equation\n\u03c6\u0308 + 3H \u03c6\u0307 + V\u03c6 = 0 ,\n\n(4)\n\nwhere V\u03c6 = \u2202V /\u2202\u03c6. We will consider the simple chaotic inflation potentials V = 21 m2 \u03c62 and V = 41 \u03bb\u03c64 . Although\nthe resonance in scalar fluctuations is dramatically increased when the inflaton is coupled to other fields, for example\nvia the additional potential term 21 g 2 \u03c62 \u03c72 , this does not seem to have an effect on tensor fluctuations (Tilley 2000).\nThus we will confine ourselves to simplified single-field models of preheating. Preheating in more realistic models ends\nwhen backreaction effects of the fluctuations destroy the coherence of inflaton oscillations. In our simplified models,\nbackreaction effects are not incorporated, but we can use the results from detailed investigations to estimate the time\nthat preheating lasts (see, e.g., Kofman et al. 1997).\nThe Hubble rate is determined by the Friedmann equation\n\u0002\n\u0003\nH 2 = 31 \u03ba2 12 \u03c6\u03072 + V (\u03c6) ,\n(5)\n\nwhere \u03ba2 = 8\u03c0/Mp2 . Equations (4) and (5) imply \u1e22 = \u2212 21 \u03ba2 \u03c6\u03072 . The energy density and effective pressure of the\ninflaton are\n\u0001\n\u0001\n(6)\n\u03c1 = \u03ba2 12 \u03c6\u03072 + V , p = \u03ba2 12 \u03c6\u03072 \u2212 V .\n\nDuring slow-roll inflation, the coupled equations (4) and (5) have approximate analytic solutions for the simple\npotentials. When the value of \u03c6 drops low enough, slow-roll ends and the oscillatory regime begins. The approximate\nanalytic forms are (see, e.g., Kaiser 1997, Kofman et al. 1997)\nsin \u03c4\nwhere \u03c4 = m(t \u2212 tin ) and V = 12 m2 \u03c62 ,\n\u03c4\u0012\n\u0013\n\u221a\n\u03c6in\n1\n\u03c6\u2248\nwhere \u03c4 = \u03bb\u03c6in (\u03b7 \u2212 \u03b7in ) and V = 14 \u03bb\u03c64 ,\ncn \u03c4, \u221a\na\n2\n\n\u03c6 \u2248 \u03c6in\n\n(7)\n(8)\n\nwhere ain = 1 and cn is a Jacobian elliptic function. The initial values of \u03c6in are \u223c 0.3Mp in the quadratic case, and\n\u223c 0.6Mp in the quartic case.\nTime-averaging over oscillations shows that \u0101 \u221d t2/3 for the quadratic potential, and \u0101 \u221d t1/2 for the quartic\npotential. These are the asymptotic values of the scale factor, but in practice backreaction effects due to couplings\nwill end the preheating oscillations. If one uses the average forms \u0101 for a, i.e., if one ignores oscillatory behaviour in\nthe inflaton, then one regains the standard results for gravitational wave evolution in the dust and radiation eras. In\nparticular, models with a smooth transition from inflation to radiation-domination, neglecting reheating dynamics,\nshow that there is no super-Hubble amplification of gravitational waves (e.g. Caldwell 1996, Tilley and Maartens\n1998) . Our numerical integrations show that this averaging loses interesting features in the gravitational waves (see\nSection 3). We do not use the approximate forms in Eqs. (7) and (8) for our numerical results-instead, we integrate\nthe Friedmann and Klein-Gordon equations numerically.\n\n2\n\n\f3. MAXWELL-WEYL GRAVITATIONAL WAVE EQUATIONS\n\nGravitational wave perturbations in the covariant approach are governed by the Maxwell-Weyl equations:\n(div E)\u03bc = 0 = (div H)\u03bc ,\n\u0116\u03bc\u03bd + 3HE\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 curl H\u03bc\u03bd = \u2212 21 (\u03c1 + p)\u03c3\u03bc\u03bd ,\n\u1e22\u03bc\u03bd + 3HH\u03bc\u03bd + curl E\u03bc\u03bd = 0 ,\n\nwhere \u03c3\u03bc\u03bd is the shear, a dot denotes u\u03bc \u2207\u03bc , and div and curl are the covariant spatial divergence and curl for tensors\n(Maartens and Bassett 1998). These equations hold for perfect fluids and minimally coupled scalar fields (in which\ncase \u03c1 + p = \u03ba2 \u03c6\u03072 ). The shear is a tensor potential for the electric and magnetic Weyl tensors (Maartens and Bassett\n1998):\nE\u03bc\u03bd = \u2212\u03c3\u0307\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 2H\u03c3\u03bc\u03bd ,\nH\u03bc\u03bd = curl \u03c3\u03bc\u03bd ,\n\n(9)\n(10)\n\n~ = \u2212A\n~ \u0307 and H\n~ = curl A.\n~ Taking the curl and dot of the Maxwell-Weyl\nin close analogy with the Maxwell relations E\npropagation equations, and using the identity for the tensor curl of the curl, we find wave equations for the three\ntensors (Dunsby et al. 1997, Maartens and Bassett 1998, Challinor 2000). Using equations (4) and (5), these become\n\u00cb\u03bc\u03bd + 7H \u0116\u03bc\u03bd + 4\u03ba2 V (\u03c6)E\u03bc\u03bd = \u2206E\u03bc\u03bd + \u03ba2 \u03c6\u0307 [5H \u03c6\u0307 + V \u2032 (\u03c6)] \u03c3\u03bc\u03bd ,\n2\n\n\u1e26\u03bc\u03bd + 7H \u1e22\u03bc\u03bd + 4\u03ba V (\u03c6)H\u03bc\u03bd = \u2206H\u03bc\u03bd ,\nwhere \u2206 is the covariant spatial Laplacian. One can also derive a wave equation for the shear:\n\u0002\n\u0003\n\u03c3\u0308\u03bc\u03bd + 5H \u03c3\u0307\u03bc\u03bd + \u03ba2 2V (\u03c6) \u2212 12 \u03c6\u03072 \u03c3\u03bc\u03bd = \u2206\u03c3\u03bc\u03bd .\nWe decompose the tensors into modes (Challinor 2000)\ni\nX h\n(k)\nE\u03bc\u03bd = a\u22122\nk 2 Ek Q(k)\n\u03bc\u03bd + \u1ebck Q\u0303\u03bc\u03bd ,\ni\nX h\n(k)\nH\u03bc\u03bd = a\u22122\nk 2 Hk Q(k)\n\u03bc\u03bd + H\u0303k Q\u0303\u03bc\u03bd ,\ni\nX h\n(k)\n\u03c3\u03bc\u03bd = a\u22121\nk Sk Q(k)\n\u03bc\u03bd + S\u0303k Q\u0303\u03bc\u03bd ,\n\n(11)\n(12)\n\n(13)\n\n(14)\n(15)\n(16)\n\nP\nwhere\ndenotes a symbolic sum over harmonic modes, and Q, Q\u0303 are tensor harmonics of electric and magnetic\nparity, which are time-independent, transverse traceless, and related by\ncurl Q(k)\n\u03bc\u03bd =\n\nk (k)\nQ\u0303 ,\na \u03bc\u03bd\n\nshowing that the different polarization states are coupled. The mode functions Ek determine the tensor contribution\nto the CMB power spectrum. The magnetic Weyl mode functions are algebraically related to the shear mode functions\nby\nHk = S\u0303k .\nSpecializing the results in Challinor (2000) to the scalar field case, we find the evolution equations\n\u0013\n\u0012\na k2\n1 2 2\nSk = 0 ,\n\u0116k + 3HEk \u2212\n\u03ba\n\u03c6\u0307\n\u2212\n2\nk a2\nk\n\u1e60k + HSk + Ek = 0 .\na\n\n(17)\n\n(18)\n(19)\n\nFor comparison, in the time-averaged approximation, the \u03c6\u03072 term in the coefficient of Sk in Eq.

NUMERICAL RESULTS\n\nEquations (17)\u2013(19) for the gravitational wave perturbations, and (4)\u2013(5) for the background are integrated numerically, and the results are compared with those for the time-averaged approximation. We investigated the evolution of\nCOBE modes, which left the Hubble radius at about 50 to 60 e-folds before the end of inflation, so that k/aH \u223c 10\u221224\nat the start of preheating, t = tin . We also integrated for a typical small scale mode, with k/aH \u223c 10 at t = tin . The\ninitial values for\u221a\u03c6 were given in the previous section. We used the slow-roll relation to set the initial inflaton velocity,\n\u03c6\u0307in = \u2212Mp V\u03c6 / 24\u03c0V . For the tensor modes, we used the initial value 10\u22125 . The inflaton mass and self-coupling\nwere chosen as m = 10\u22126 Mp and \u03bb = 10\u221212 . In order to take account of backreaction effects, which will end the\ncoherent inflaton oscillations, we terminated the integrations after \u03c4 = 100.\nThe results are shown in Figs. 1\u20138.\n\u22125\n\n1.4\n\nx 10\n\n1.35\n\n1.3\n\n1.25\n\n1.2\n\n1.15\n\n1.1\n\n1.05\n\n1\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n70\n\n80\n\n90\n\n100\n\nFIG. 1.

CONCLUSIONS\n\nApart from specific features peculiar to the potential, these figures reflect two key properties: (1) Super-Hubble\ngravitational waves are not significantly amplified by coherent inflaton oscillations during preheating; (2) gravitational\nwaves on all scales carry some imprint of the coherent oscillatory dynamics of the inflaton during preheating. The\nlatter point is clearly brought out by a comparison with the evolution in the absence of oscillations, i.e. for the\ntime-averaged scale factor.\nIn particular, one can see that the electric Weyl modes on super-Hubble scales, which determine the effect of\ngravitational waves on the CMB (Challinor 2000), inherit oscillations from the inflaton. In the early part of preheating,\nthere is also some amplification on average of Ek , so that if backreaction takes effect early, then this does produce a\n7\n\n\fsmall amplification relative to the no-oscillation time-averaged model. However, one cannot expect these preheating\nimprints on Ek to lead to detectable differences in the CMB power spectrum. Firstly, the oscillations will effectively\nbe averaged out, and secondly, any amplification is likely to be scale invariant for all measurable anisotropies, since\nthe Hubble scale at preheating corresponds to about 1 metre today, so that all cosmologically significant scales at\npreheating effectively have k = 0, and behave like the particular scale chosen in our numerical integrations (Bassett\net al. 2000, Jedamzik and Sigl 2000).\nGravitational waves on sub-Hubble scales oscillate even in the case of time-averaged background, but Figs. 3, 4, 7\nand 8 show that the frequency and amplitude of oscillation are significantly modulated by the inflaton oscillations.\nThus preheating leaves an imprint on these scales. In principle, this could be detected, but in practice the signal will\nbe far too weak, since there is no preheating amplification on these scales.\nThe absence of amplification is fundamentally due to the expansion of the universe, since there is strong amplification on a Minkowski background of gravitational waves during preheating (Bassett 1997, Tilley 2000).\nAcknowledgement: We thank Bruce Bassett for valuable discussions and comments.\n\n[1]\n[2]\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n[15]\n[16]\n[17]\n[18]\n[19]\n[20]\n[21]\n[22]\n[23]\n[24]\n[25]\n\nBassett BA 1997 Phys.
