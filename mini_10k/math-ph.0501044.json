When a map is classically uniquely ergodic, it is expected that its quantization will posses quantum unique ergodicity.\nIn this paper we give examples of Quantum Unique Ergodicity for\nthe perturbed Kronecker map, and an upper bound for the rate of\nconvergence.\n\n1. Introduction\n1.1. Background. One of the problems in Quantum Chaos is the asymptotic behavior of the expectation value in eigenstates. When quantizing classical dynamics on a phase space one constructs a Hilbert\nspace of states ,Hh , and an algebra of operators , the algebra of \"quantum observables\", that assigns for each smooth function on the phase\nspace f an operator Oph (f ) where h implies dependence on Planck's\nconstant h, and the dynamics is quantized to a unitary time evolution\noperator, Uh on Hh . For any orthonormal basis of eigenfunctions of\nUh , {\u03c8j }, the expectation value of Oph (f ) in the eigenstate \u03c8j is given\nby hOph (f )\u03c8j , \u03c8j i. The semiclassical limit of these is the limit where\nh \u2192 0. When the classical dynamics of a system is ergodic, it is known\nthat the time average of the trajectories of the system converges to the\nspace average. An analogue of this is given by Schnirelman's Theorem\n[12],[13],[1], which states that for an ergodic system the expectation\nvalues of Op(f ) converges to the phase space average of f , for all but\npossibly a zero density subsequence of eigenfunctions. This is referred\nto as quantum ergodicity. The case where there are no exceptional\nsubsequences is referred to as quantum unique ergodicity (QUE).\nWhen the phase space is T2 = R2 /Z2 it is required that each state\nwill be periodic in both position and momentum and thus Planck's\nconstant is restricted to be an inverse of an integer h = N1 , and the\nHilbert space is of dimension N, namely L2 (Z/NZ). The semiclassical\nlimit in this case is the limit where N \u2192 \u221e. Given a continuous map\nA on T2 , we define its quantization as a sequence of unitary operators\n1\n\n\f2\n\nLIOR ROSENZWEIG\n\non L2 (Z/NZ), UN (A) satisfying\n(1)\n\nkUN (A)\u22121 OpN (f )UN (A) \u2212 OpN (f \u25e6 A)k \u2212\u2192 0\n\nas N \u2192 \u221e\n\nfor all f \u2208 C \u221e (T2 ), where f \u25e6 A(p, q) = f (A(p, q)). This is an analogue\nof Egorov's Theorem, and the eigenfunctions of UN (A) are analogues\nof eigenmodes.\nA first example of QUE was given on the 2-torus T2 ,by Marklof\nand Rudnick [9], where the classical dynamics is an irrational skew\ntranslation, that is classically uniquely ergodic. For this map they\n1\nfound that for generic translations, the rate of convergence is O(N 4 +\u01eb ).\nA famous example of a quantization of a map is of linear automorphism\nof T2 called the \"CAT map\",([6],[3]), that is if A \u2208 SL(2, Z). If |trA| >\n2 that is if A is hyperbolic, then the map is known to be ergodic, but\nnot uniquely ergodic. In this case it was shown that there is no QUE\n([4]), but there exists a special basis (Hecke Basis) for which QUE holds\n1\n([7]). In this case the rate of convergence was shown to be O(N 4 +\u01eb ),\n1\nand is conjectured to be O(N 2 +\u01eb ). (It was shown that in the case where\nN = p where p is a prime number the rate of convergence is O(p1/2 )\n[5]).\nIn this paper we will give a family of more examples of QUE on the\n2-torus, all of them are also classically uniquely ergodic, and study the\nrate of convergence.\n1.2. QUE for maps on the torus. The map in this paper will be\nthe perturbed Kronecker map, that is\n\u03a6\u03b1V :\n\nT2 \u2192 T2\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\np\np + \u03b11\n\u03b1\n\u03a6V :\n7\u2192\nq\nq + \u03b12 + V (p)\n\nmod 1\n\nwhere \u03b1 = (\u03b11 , \u03b12 ), and V (p) is a smooth function of zero mean on T.\nThe special case where V (p) = 0 (the standard Kronecker map) plays\na central role here. It is known that in this case the map is uniquely\nergodic if and only if 1, \u03b11 , \u03b12 are linearly independent over Q. We\nwill construct a quantization of it by approximating \u03b1 with rational\nnumbers Na = (a1N,a2 ) . For rational numbers we have an exact Egorov\ntheorem, that is\n\u22121\nUa,N\nOpN (f )Ua,N = OpN (f \u25e6 \u03c4a/N )\n\nand thus by the convergence of Na to \u03b1 we will get (1). For this map\nwe have the following theorem for polynomials:\n\n\fQUANTUM UNIQUE ERGODICITY FOR MAPS ON THE TORUS\n\n3\n\nTheorem 1.1. Suppose 1, \u03b11 , \u03b12 are linearly independent over Q. Let\nf \u2208 C \u221e (T2 ) be a trigonometric polynomial. Then for all eigenfunctions\n\u03c8 of UN (\u03c4\u03b1 ) we have that for N sufficiently large\nZ\nhOpN (f )\u03c8, \u03c8i =\nf (p, q)dpdq\nT2\n\nFor the more general case of smooth functions we assume a certain\nrestriction on \u03b1. We assume that \u03b1 satisfy a certain diophantine inequality, that is there exists \u03b3 > 0 such that for all n1 , n2 , k \u2208 Z\n\n(2)\n\n|n1 \u03b11 + n2 \u03b12 + k| \u226b k(n1 , n2 )k\u2212\u03b3\n\n(n1 , n2 ) 6= (0, 0)\n\nThis reduces the set of numbers rather than being all \u03b1 such that\n1, \u03b11 , \u03b12 are linearly independent over Q to a set of almost all \u03b1 in\nLebesgue measure sense, and \u03b3 can be any number strictly bigger than\n2 (see theorem (3.8)[10]. If \u03b11 , \u03b12 are algebraic of degree d1 , d2 respectively we can choose \u03b3 to be d1 !d2 ! ([11]). For these \u03b1 we have,\nTheorem 1.2. Suppose 1, \u03b11 , \u03b12 are linearly independent over Q and\nsatisfy (2) then for all f \u2208 C \u221e (T2 ) ,for all eigenfunctions \u03c8 of UN (\u03c4\u03b1 )\nZ\n|hOpN (f )\u03c8, \u03c8i \u2212\nf (p, q)dpdq| \u226a N \u2212\u03b8 \u2200\u03b8 > 0\nT2\n\nOur main result is for the perturbed Kronecker map \u03a6\u03b1V , for arbitrary\nsmooth V (p). We show that the map is also uniquely ergodic. In fact\nwe show that it is conjugate to \u03c4\u03b1 and we also have QUE for it, and\ngive an upper bound for the rate of convergence:\nTheorem 1.3. Suppose 1, \u03b11 , \u03b12 are linearly independent over Q and\nsatisfy (2) then for all f \u2208 C \u221e (T2 ) ,for all eigenfunctions \u03c8 of UN (\u03a6\u03b1V )\nZ\n|hOpN (f )\u03c8, \u03c8i \u2212\nf (p, q)dpdq| \u226a N \u22122\nT2\n\nThus for such \u03b1 the rate of convergence of the matrix elements to\ntheir classical average is much faster that the expected and known rates\nmentioned earlier on the irrational skew translation and the CAT map.\nWe also construct special pairs (\u03b11 , \u03b12 ) and functions f (p, q) for which\nthe rate of convergence is arbitrarily slow (Theorems 3.3,3.16).\nacknowledgments\n\nThis work was supported in part by the EC TMR network Mathematical Aspects of Quantum Chaos, EC-contract no HPRN-CT-2000-00103\nand the Israel Science Foundation founded by the Israel Academy of\nSciences and Humanities.

Background\nWe begin with a quantization procedure for maps on the 2-torus T2 .\nThe procedure can be find in full description in [7],[2]. We construct a\nHilbert space of state Hh with respect to Planck's constant h, quantum\nobservables, and a quantization of our maps.\n2.1. Notations. We abbreviate e(x) = e2\u03c0ix , and eN (x) = e( Nx ). A \u226a\nB or A = O(B) both means that there is a constant c such that |A| \u2264\nc|B|.\n2.2. Hilbert space of state. Our classical phase space is T2 . The\nelements of the Hilbert space are thus, distribution on the line R that\nare periodic in both position and momentum. Using the momentum\nrepresentation of a wave-function \u03c8 by the Fourier transform\nZ \u221e\n1\n\u2212qp\n\u221a\n)dq\nFh \u03c8(p) =\n\u03c8(q)e(\nh\nh \u2212\u221e\nwe find that the requirements\n\u03c8(q + 1) = \u03c8(q) Fh \u03c8(p) = Fh \u03c8(p + 1)\nrestricts planck's constant h to be an inverse of integer h = N1 , and Hh\nconsists of periodic point-mass distributions at the coordinates Q =\nq\n. We therefore find that the Hilbert space is of dimension N, and\nN\ntherefore denote HN , and we may identify it with L2 (Z/NZ), with the\ninner product\n1 X\n\u03c8(Q)\u03c6\u0304(Q)\nh\u03c8, \u03c6i =\nN Q mod N\nThe Fourier transform is given by\n1\n\u03c8\u0302(P ) = [FN \u03c8] (P ) = \u221a\nN\n\nQ\n\nand its inverse formula is\nh\ni\n1\n\u03c8(Q) = FN\u22121 \u03c8\u0302 (Q) = \u221a\nN\n\nX\n\n\u03c8(Q)eN (\u2212QP )\n\nmod N\n\nP\n\nX\n\nmod N\n\n\u03c8\u0302(P )eN (P Q)\n\n\fQUANTUM UNIQUE ERGODICITY FOR MAPS ON THE TORUS\n\n5\n\n2.3.

Perturbed Kronecker map. Another family of uniquely ergodic maps on T2 , is the perturbed Kronecker map. we see in this\nsection that it is uniquely ergodic, due to the fact that it is conjugate\nto the Kronecker map itself, and in the following section we form a\nquantization for it.

In order to prove the\nunique ergodicity of this map, we will use the following Lemma that\nshows that the perturbed map is conjugate to the Kronecker map.\nLemma 3.11. Suppose \u03b11 is irrational.\n(1) If V (p) is a polynomial we have that\n\u03c4\u03b1 \u25e6 \u03a6V = \u03a6h \u25e6 \u03c4\u03b1 \u25e6 \u03a6\u22121\nh\n\n(2) If \u03b11 is diophantine then (1) holds for any V \u2208 C \u221e (T)\nfor some h = hV \u2208 C \u221e (T)\nProof.\n\n(1) The RHS of (1) is\n\u0012\n\u0013\np + \u03b11\n\u22121\n\u03a6hk \u25e6 \u03c4\u03b1 \u25e6 \u03a6hk (p, q) =\nq + \u03b12 + hk (p + \u03b11 ) \u2212 hk (p)\n\ne(kx)\n(which is well defined for all k only if\ndefine hk (p) = e(k\u03b1\n1 )\u22121\n\u03b11 is irrational). hk (p) satisfy that e(kp) = hk (p + \u03b11 ) \u2212 hk (p)\nand therefore we get (1),and by linearity we get that(1) holds\nfor every polynomial.\n(2) For V \u2208 C \u221e (T), \u03b1 diophantine , we observe that |e(k\u03b11 ) \u2212 1| \u223c\n{k\u03b1} \u226b |k|1\u03b3 and we get that\nX\nX\n|V\u0302 (k)||k|\u03b3\n|V\u0302 (k)hk (p)| \u226a\nk\u2208Z\n\nk\u2208Z\n\nP\nconverges absolutely and so define hV (p) =\nk\u2208Z V\u0302 (k)hk (p).\nThen hV (p) satisfies hV (p + \u03b11 ) \u2212 hV (p) = V (p) since hk satisfy\nthat for every k since the series converges absolutely.\n\u0003\nWith \u03a6\u03b1V described as a conjugate of \u03c4\u03b1 we have the following result:\n\n\fQUANTUM UNIQUE ERGODICITY FOR MAPS ON THE TORUS\n\n15\n\nTheorem 3.12. Suppose 1, \u03b11 , \u03b12 are linearly independent over Q.\nThen for \u03b1 diophantine and V (p) \u2208 C \u221e (T) then \u03a6\u03b1V is uniquely ergodic.\nProof. We will first show that Lebesgue measure is \u03a6\u03b1V invariant. Suppose f (p, q) \u2208 L1 (T2 ). Then f \u25e6 \u03a6\u03b1V (p, q) = f (p, q + V (p)) and so\nZ 1Z 1\nZ 1Z 1\nf (p + \u03b11 , q + V (p) + \u03b12 )dqdp =\nf (p, q)dqdp\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\n0\n\nby standard change of variables. Now, assume \u03bc is an invariant measure\n\u221e\nof \u03a6\u03b1V . since \u03a6\u03b1V = \u03a6h \u25e6 \u03c4\u03b1 \u25e6 \u03a6\u22121\nh for some h \u2208 C (T), then \u03a6h \u25e6 \u03bc\nis invariant measure of \u03c4\u03b1 , but there exists only one such measure\nand which is Lebesgue measure m, that is \u03a6h \u25e6 \u03bc = m is Lebesgue\nmeasure. \u03a6h is an invertible map, that preserves Lebesgue measure, so\n\u03b1\n\u03bc = \u03a6\u22121\n\u0003\nh \u25e6 m = m therefore \u03a6V is uniquely ergodic.\n3.4. QUE for perturbed Kronecker map. In this section we will\nstudy the asymptotic behaviour of the matrix elements related to the\nperturbed Kronecker map. The main tool will be lemma 3.11 that\nconnects the perturbed map to the unperturbed map.\nIn order to quantize the perturbed Kronecker map, we use the following theorem of Marklof-O'Keefe [8]:\n\nTheorem 3.13 (Marklof-O'Keefe). For every function f \u2208 C \u221e (T2 )\nwe have\n\u0001\nc(f )\n(17)\n|h Uv\u22121 OpN (f )Uv \u2212 OpN (f \u25e6 \u03a6v ) \u03c8, \u03c8i| \u226a\nN2\nUsing the equality in Lemma (3.11) and the quantization of the perturbation map in theorem 3.13, we can describe the quantization of\n\u03a6\u03b1V = \u03c4\u03b1 \u25e6 \u03a6v as follows:\n\nTheorem 3.14. Denote UN = Uh (N)\u22121 U\u03c4 (N)Uh (N) where U\u03c4 (N) is\nthe quantization of \u03c4\u03b1 , then we have\n(18)\n\nkUN\u22121 OpN (f )UN \u2212 OpN (f \u25e6 \u03a6\u03b1v )k \u226a N \u22121\n\nProof. We already know that\nand that\n\nkUh\u22121 OpN (f )Uh \u2212 OpN (f \u25e6 \u03a6h )k = O(N \u22122 )\nkU\u03c4 (N)\u22121 OpN (f )U\u03c4 \u2212 OpN (f \u25e6 \u03c4 )k = O(N \u22121 )\n\nand thus using the equality in Lemma (3.11) we conclude the proof \u0003\nRemark 3.3. The set {\u03c8j = Uh (N)\u22121 \u03c8j\u03c4 } form a basis of eigenfunctions of UN , where {\u03c8j\u03c4 } is a basis of eigenfunctions for U\u03c4 .\n\n\f16\n\nLIOR ROSENZWEIG\n\nWith this representation of the eigenfunctions we can give an upper\nbound for the asymptotic behavior of the matrix elements:\nTheorem 3.15. For every f \u2208 C \u221e (T2 ), \u03b1 diophantine we have:\nZ\n|hOpN (f )\u03c8j , \u03c8j i \u2212 f | \u226a N \u22122\nProof. Without loss of generality we will assume that\ndefinition we have\nhOpN (f )\u03c8j , \u03c8j i = hOpN (f )Uh\u22121 \u03c8j\u03c4 , Uh\u22121 \u03c8j\u03c4 i\n\nR\n\nf = 0. By\n\nand since Uh is unitary we have\nhOpN (f )\u03c8j , \u03c8j i = hUh OpN (f )Uh\u22121 \u03c8j\u03c4 , \u03c8j\u03c4 i\nNow using Theorem 3.13 we get,\n(19)\n\n|hUh OpN (f )Uh\u22121 \u03c8j\u03c4 , \u03c8j\u03c4 i \u2212 hOpN (f \u25e6 \u03a6h )\u03c8j\u03c4 , \u03c8j\u03c4 i| \u226a N \u22122\n\nsince \u03c8j is a normalized wavefunction , but since f \u25e6\u03a6h is still a C \u221e (T2 )\nwe have that the second term is O(N \u221210 ) and therefore\nhOpN (f )\u03c8j , \u03c8j i \u226a N \u22122\n\u0003\nRemark 3.4. The upper bound found here is valid only for the quantization of described here which includes an arbitrary choice of a sequence\nthat converges to \u03b1 by rational numbers. Since this quantization is not\nunique, and since the operators kUN (a)\u2212UN (a\u2032 )k \u223c N1 this upper bound\nonly applies with the specific eigenfunctions for a specific chosen convergent sequence for \u03b1.\nAs for the standard Kronecker map , we can also construct special\n\u03b1, f \u2208 C \u221e (T2 ) with arbitrary slow convergence:\nTheorem 3.16. For any positive increasing g(x) there exist \u03b1, f \u0303(p, q) \u2208\nC \u221e (T2 ) and a basis of eigenfunctions {\u03c8j }N\nj=1 such that\nZ\n1\nf \u0303| \u226b\nhOpN (f \u0303)\u03c8j , \u03c8j i \u2212\ng(N)\nT2\n\u221a\n\u221a\nProof. Take \u03b1 to be the pair ( 2, \u03b2) as in theorem 3.3. Since 2 is\ndiophantine then \u03a6\u03b1V is still conjugate to \u03c4\u03b1 , we still have\n|hUh OpN (f \u0303)Uh\u22121 \u03c8j\u03c4 , \u03c8j\u03c4 i \u2212 hOpN (f \u0303 \u25e6 \u03a6h )\u03c8j\u03c4 , \u03c8j\u03c4 i| \u226a N \u22122\n\n\fQUANTUM UNIQUE ERGODICITY FOR MAPS ON THE TORUS\n\n17\n\n\u03c4\n\u03c4\nAnd thus for f \u0303 = f \u25e6 \u03a6\u22121\nh , {\u03c8j } where f (p, q), \u03c8j are the function and\northonormal basis constructed for the proof of theorem 3.3 we have\nZ\n1\n \u0303\nf \u0303| \u226b\n|hOpN (f )\u03c8j , \u03c8j i \u2212\ng(N)\nT2\n\u0003\n\nRemark 3.5.
