Simulations produce metals\nself-consistently, based on one single parameter, the metal yield, which in turn\nis constrained by metallicity in the intra-cluster gas. We follow metals as a\nseparate density species. For the metallicity of Ly\u03b1 clouds with column density\nof NHI \u223c 1014.5 \u2212 1015.5 cm\u22122 at z = 2 \u2212 4 we find reasonable agreement between\nsimulations, both with and without GSW, and observations (Schaye et al. ).\nA unique signature and sensitive test of GSW is, however, provided by lower\ndensity regions with gas density of \u03c1/h\u03c1i = 0.01 \u2212 1.0 and a corresponding\ncolumn density of 1012 \u2212 1014 cm\u22122 . Without GSW we predict that both the\nmean and median metallicity of Ly\u03b1 clouds in this column density range at\nz = 2 \u2212 4 should have Z \u2264 10\u22123 Z\u2299 , since these small systems support little\nstar formation. GSW contaminate these regions, however, and also there is\na significant fraction (\u223c 25%) of Ly\u03b1 clouds in this column density range\nwhich have a high metallicity excess of 10\u22122 Z\u2299 , resulting in a mean metallicity\nof \u223c 10\u22122 Z\u2299 . In addition, we find that there is a minimum in the median\nmetallicity for clouds of NHI \u223c 1013 \u2212 1014 cm\u22122 in the case with GSW,\nwhereas without GSW the metallicity decreases monotonically and rapidly with\ndecreasing column density. Finally, we predict that the ratio of secondary (e.g.,\nN) to primary metals (e.g., O,C) is expected to be smaller by a factor of 10\nin clouds of NHI \u223c 1014.5 cm\u22122 compared to that in large galaxies; this factor\nincreases to \u2265 50 for NHI \u2264 1013.5 cm\u22122 .\nSubject headings: Cosmology: large-scale structure of Universe \u2013 cosmology:\ntheory \u2013 intergalactic medium \u2013 quasars: absorption lines \u2013 hydrodynamics\n1\n2\n\nPrinceton University Observatory, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ 08544; cen@astro.princeton.edu\n\nHarvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics,\nknagamin@cfa.harvard.edu\n3\n\n60 Garden Street,\n\nCambridge,\n\nMA 02138;\n\nPrinceton University Observatory, Princeton University, Princeton, NJ 08544; jpo@astro.princeton.edu\n\n\f\u20132\u2013\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nDirect observational evidence for feedback from galactic superwinds (GSW) originating\nin starburst galaxies is ubiquitous both at low redshift (e.g., McCarthy, Heckman, & van\nBreugel 1987; Heckman, Armus, & Miley 1987; Papaderos et al. 1994; Marlowe et al.\n1995; Lehnert & Heckman 1996; Bland & Tully 1988; Filippenko & Sargent 1992; Dahlem,\nWeaver, & Heckman 1998; Heckman et al. 1998; Martin 1999; Yoshida, Taniguchi, &\nMurayama 1999; Veilleux et al. 1999; Della Ceca et al. 1999; Veilleux, Shopbell, & Miller\n2001; Rupke, Veilleux, & Sanders 2002; Martin, Kobulnicky, & Heckman 2002) and at\nhigh redshift (e.g., Franx et al. 1997; Pettini et al. 1998; Dawson et al. 2002; Pettini et\nal. 2001, 2002; Adelberger 2003; Adelberger et al. 2003). In addition, two lines of indirect\nbut independent observational evidence point to the existence or need of GSW. First,\nthe low-to-moderate density regions of the intergalactic medium (IGM) in Ly\u03b1 clouds at\nz \u223c 2 \u2212 3 have already been enriched with metals to significant levels (e.g., Tytler et al.\n1995; Songaila & Cowie 1996; Bergeron et al. 2002) to a level that would be difficult to\nachieve by sources embedded in those regions. And in the warm-hot intergalactic medium\nat low redshift (e.g., Tripp, Savage, & Jenkins 2000; Fang et al. 2002; Nicastro et al.\n2002; Mathur, Weinberg, & Chen 2003) metals are seen that presumably originate from\nthe galaxies central to these regions. Second, a substantial, non-gravitational heating\nsource of the intra-cluster medium may be needed to produce the observed X-ray cluster\nluminosity-temperature relation and its evolution (e.g., Kaiser 1991; White 1991; David,\nForman, & Jones 1991; Metzler & Evrard 1994; Navarro, Frenk, & White 1995; Pen 1999;\nPonman, Cannon, & Navarro 1999; Balogh, Babul, & Patton 1999; Loewenstein 2000; Wu,\nFabian, & Nulsen 2000; Lloyd-Davies, Ponman, & Cannon 2000; Brighenti & Mathews\n2001; Neumann & Arnaud 2001; Borgani et al. 2001; Voit & Bryan 2001; Tozzi & Norman\n2001; Dav\u00e9 et al. 2001; Babul et al. 2002; Bialek, Evrard, & Mohr 2001; McCarthy, Babul,\n& Balogh 2002; Afshordi & Cen 2002; Voit et al. 2002). GSW may play a significant role in\nthe transport of metal-enriched matter to lower density regions outside galaxies and may\nhelp provide the requisite non-gravitational heating source for the cluster gas.\nIn contrast to notable successes of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations of the\nIGM that has not been intimately involved in star formation, such as the Lyman-alpha\nforest (Cen et al. 1994; Zhang et al. 1995; Hernquist et al. 1996; Miralda-Escud\u00e9 et al.\n1996; Bond & Wadsley 1997; Theuns et al. 1998), few calculations have been made to\ninvestigate the impact of GSW on the IGM in a coherent fashion. So far, most brute-force\ncosmological hydrodynamic simulations do not include the feedback effects of the GSW.\nFor those simulations with GSW included (Cen, & Ostriker 1992, 1993a,b; Cen et al.\n1994; Gnedin & Ostriker 1997; Gnedin 1998; Cen & Ostriker 1999b; Springel & Hernquist\n2003; Kay et al. 2002; Theuns et al. 2002), the obtained results are often paradoxical; for\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nexample, in very high resolution simulations dense regions tend to radiate away most of\nthe GSW feedback energy and thus largely suppress its effect. This is for the most part\ndue to the limited (and sometimes mismatched spatial and mass) numerical resolutions\nwith the inability to properly represent, in cosmological simulations, a multi-phase ISM,\nwhere a GSW originates. On the other hand, simulations with lower resolution, limited by\navailable computer power, but with a crude multi-phase medium treatment (e.g., Cen &\nOstriker 1999a,b) appear to be able to exert substantial feedback energy on the general\nIGM surrounding galaxies. But the very limited resolution of these simulations does not\nallow us to draw reliable quantitative conclusions.\nAlthough it is generally accepted that energy from collective supernova explosions and\nstellar winds should be powering the GSW (Ostriker & Cowie 1981; see Aguirre 1999 for\na role that radiation pressure on dust plays in driving outflows), the complex structure of\nthe interstellar medium (ISM) (McKee & Ostriker 1977) and the IGM makes quantitative\ncalculations of GSW and subsequent evolution a daunting task, which certainly requires\ntreatment of a multi-phase medium and may necessitate the explicit inclusion of magnetic\nfields (Koo & McKee 1992a,b; Smith 1996; Suchkov et al. 1996; Nath & Trentham 1997;\nHartquist, Dyson, & Williams 1997; Gnedin & Ostriker 1997; Gnedin 1998; Mac Low &\nFerrara 1999; Cen & Ostriker 1999b; Ferrara, Pettini, & Shchekinov 2000; Madau, Ferrara,\n& Rees 2001; Aguirre et al. 2001; Mori, Ferrara & Madau 2002; Scannapieco, Thacker, &\nDavis 2001; Scannapieco, Ferrara, & Madau 2002; Thacker, Scannapieco, & Davis 2002;\nWhite, Hernquist, & Springel 2002; Dyson, Arthur, & Hartquist 2002; Springel & Hernquist\n2003). Significant progress has been made recently to provide a better treatment of the\nmulti-phase interstellar medium (Yepes et al. 1997; Elizondo et al. 1999a,b; Hultman &\nPharasyn 1999; Ritchie & Thomas 2001; Springel & Hernquist 2003) but the generation of\nGSW is far from being adequately modeled. Clearly, a combination of both high resolution\nand detailed multi-phase medium treatment (including magnetic fields and cosmic rays) is\nrequisite before our understanding of the interactions between galaxy formation and IGM\ncan be considered to be truly satisfactory.\nBut we will follow a somewhat different approach. We will not attempt to model the\ncomplex physics which determines how much of the SN energy produced within the galaxies\ncan escape the galaxies. Rather we will inject energy directly into the medium surrounding\nthe galaxies in a fashion that drives GSW and we will adjust the energy input to match\nthe observed GSW. Direct and empirical determination of the output of energy and metal\nenriched gas from GSW is, in principle, possible (Chevalier & Clegg 1985), although, in\npractice, a complete account of the energy and mass output (especially the hot component\nat the X-ray band) from GSW may require more involved work (Strickland & Stevens\n2000). Nevertheless, direct observational determinations of mass and energy loss rates from\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nGSW have yielded very interesting results (see Heckman 2001 for a recent review), with\nobservations of both low redshift starburst galaxies and high redshift Lyman Break Galaxies\n(LBGs) indicating that both mass and energy outflows from GSW are comparable to those\nsupplied by the interior starburst.\nThus, we accept at the outset our inability to correctly model the detailed structure\nof the ISM within these galaxies or the generation of the GSW. Rather, we will simply\nassume a proportionality between the star formation rate \u1e40\u2217 in the system and the output\nby that system of wind mass flux and energy flux, since there is a sound observational\nbasis for this assumption. So we will assume that the energy output in a GSW is related\nto the star formation rate by \u0116GSW = eGSW c2 \u1e40\u2217 (where c is the speed of light) and the\nmass output is \u1e40GSW = \u03b2GSW \u1e40\u2217 . The two adjustable parameters (eGSW , \u03b2GSW ) are\nthen determined by a fit to observations (e.g., Pettini et al. 2001,2002; Heckman 2001),\nspecifically, the two observed parameters - the mass flow rate and the wind velocity, and\nour subsequent computations are utilized to determine the effects of the consequent GSW\non the metallicity distribution within the IGM, the shock-heating input to the IGM and\nthe modification/regulation of subsequent galaxy formation. In brief, we seek to model the\nconsequences not the causes of GSW feedback, and this is something that we think our\ncodes are well designed to do. It should be stated that our approach is clearly incapable of\nfully solving the feedback process, since it is a phenomenological approach. But this is a\nmajor step forward to understand the effects of GSW, given the current state of knowledge\nwhich leaves the physics of generation of GSW largely unconstrained.\nIt may be useful to put this in a historical context. A decade ago the focus of\ncosmological simulations (e.g., Cen et al. 1994) was to fit the observed Ly\u03b1 forest into the\npicture of modern hierarchical structure formation theory. The result was the emergence of\nthe now standard theory for Ly\u03b1 forest based on the growth/collapse of small scale density\nperturbations at moderate redshift. In this post-WMAP (Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy\nProbe) era, research focus for Ly\u03b1 forest has become to provide answers to the following\nquestion: how does galaxy formation affect the properties of Ly\u03b1 forest and how is the\npower spectrum of primordial density fluctuation on small-scales reconstructed from Ly\u03b1\nforest flux distribution subject to various processes related to galaxy formation? This paper\nattempts to provide some partial answers to the first half of the question. In this first of a\nseries of papers focusing on the effects of GSW on the IGM and subsequent galaxy/star\nformation, we will investigate the effect of GSW on the metal enrichment of the Ly\u03b1 forest\nat high redshift (z = 2 \u2212 4), which contains most of the mass as well as volume of the IGM\nthen. The outline of this paper is as follows. The simulation details are given in \u00a72. In \u00a73\nwe give detailed results and we conclude in \u00a74.\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\n2.\n\nSimulations\n\nNumerical methods of the cosmological hydrodynamic code and input physical\ningredients have been described in detail in an earlier paper (Cen et al. 2003). We will name\nthe code TIGER, Tvd for Intergalactic medium and Galaxy Evolution and foRmation.\nBriefly, the simulation integrates five sets of equations simultaneously: the Euler equations\nfor gas dynamics, rate equations for different hydrogen and helium species at different\nionization states, the Newton's equations of motion for dynamics of collisionless particles,\nthe Poisson's equation for obtaining the gravitational potential field and the equation\ngoverning the evolution of the intergalactic ionizing radiation field, all in cosmological\ncomoving coordinates. Note that the cosmological (frequency dependent) radiation field\nis solved for self-consistently, rather than being a separate input to the modeling. The\ngasdynamical equations are solved using the TVD (Total Variation Diminishing) shock\ncapturing code (Ryu et al. 1993) on an uniform mesh. The rate equations are treated using\nsub-cycles within a hydrodynamic time step due to much shorter ionization time-scales\n(i.e., the rate equations are very \"stiff\"). Dark matter particles are advanced in time using\nthe standard particle-mesh (PM) scheme. The gravitational potential on an uniform mesh\nis solved using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) method.\nThe initial conditions adopted are those for Gaussian processes with the phases of the\ndifferent waves being random and uncorrelated. The initial condition is generated by the\nCOSMICS software package kindly provided by E. Bertschinger (2001).\nCooling and heating processes due to all the principal line and continuum atomic\nprocesses for a plasma of primordial composition with additional metals ejected from star\nformation (see below), Compton cooling due to the microwave background radiation field\nand Compton cooling/heating due to the X-ray and high energy background are computed\nin a time-dependent, non-equilibrium fashion. The cooling due to metals is computed\nusing a code based on the Raymond-Smith code (Raymond, Cox, & Smith 1976) assuming\nionization equilibrium (Cen et al. 1995).\nWe follow star formation using a well defined prescription used by us in our earlier work\n(Cen & Ostriker 1992,1993) and similar to that of other investigators (Katz, Hernquist, &\nWeinberg 1992; Katz, Weinberg, & Hernquist 1996; Steinmetz 1996; Gnedin & Ostriker\n1997). A stellar particle of mass m\u2217 = c\u2217 mgas \u2206t/t\u2217 is created (the same amount is removed\nfrom the gas mass in the cell), if the gas in a cell at any time meets the following three\nconditions simultaneously: (i) contracting flow, (ii) cooling time less than dynamic\ntime, and\nq\n7\n(iii) Jeans unstable, where \u2206t is the time step, t\u2217 = max(tdyn , 10 yrs), tdyn = 3\u03c0/(32G\u03c1tot )\nis the dynamical time of the cell, mgas is the baryonic gas mass in the cell and c\u2217 = 0.07 is\nstar formation efficiency. Each stellar particle has a number of other attributes at birth,\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nincluding formation time ti , initial gas metallicity and the free-fall time in the birth cell\ntdyn . The typical mass of a stellar particle in the simulation is about one million solar\nmasses; in other words, these stellar particles are like coeval globular clusters.\nStellar particles are subsequently treated dynamically as collisionless particles.\nBut feedback from star formation is allowed in three forms: ionizing UV photons,\nsupernova kinetic energy (i.e., GSW), and metal-enrich gas, all being proportional to\nthe local star formation rate. The temporal release of all three feedback components\nat time t has the same form: f (t, ti , tdyn ) \u2261 (1/tdyn )[(t \u2212 ti )/tdyn ] exp[\u2212(t \u2212 ti )/tdyn ].\nWithin a time step dt, the released GSW energy to the IGM, ejected mass from\nstars into the IGM and escape UV radiation energy are eGSW f (t, ti , tdyn )m\u2217 c2 dt,\nemass f (t, ti , tdyn )m\u2217 dt and fesc (Z)eU V (Z)f (t, ti , tdyn )m\u2217 c2 dt. We use the Bruzual-Charlot\npopulation synthesis code (Bruzual & Charlot 1993; Bruzual 2000) to compute the\nintrinsic metallicity-dependent UV spectra from stars with Salpeter IMF (with a\nlower and upper mass cutoff of 0.1 M\u2299 and 125 M\u2299 ). Note that eU V is no longer just\na simple coefficient but a function of metallicity. The Bruzual-Charlot code gives\neU V = (1.2 \u00d7 10\u22124 , 9.7 \u00d7 10\u22125 , 8.2 \u00d7 10\u22125 , 7.0 \u00d7 10\u22125 , 5.6 \u00d7 10\u22125 , 3.9 \u00d7 10\u22125 , 1.6 \u00d7 10\u22126) at\nZ/ Z\u2299 = (5.0 \u00d7 10\u22123 , 2.0 \u00d7 10\u22122, 2.0 \u00d7 10\u22121 , 4.0 \u00d7 10\u22121 , 1.0, 2.5, 5.0). We also implement\na gas metallicity dependent ionizing photon escape fraction from galaxies in the sense\nthat higher metallicity hence higher dust content galaxies are assumed to allow a lower\nescape fraction; we adopt the escape fractions of fesc = 2% and 5% (Hurwitz et al. 1997;\nDeharveng et al. 2001; Heckman et al. 2001) for solar and one tenth of solar metallicity,\nrespectively, and interpolate/extrapolate using a linear log form of metallicity. In addition,\nwe include the emission from quasars using the spectral form observationally derived by\nSazonov, Ostriker, & Sunyaev (2004), with a radiative efficiency in terms of stellar mass of\neQSO = 2.5 \u00d7 10\u22125 for h\u03bd > 13.6eV. Finally, hot, shocked regions (like clusters of galaxies)\nemit ionizing photons due to bremsstrahlung radiation, which are also included. The UV\ncomponent is simply averaged over the box, since the light propagation time across our box\nis small compared to the time steps. The radiation field (from 1eV to 100keV) is followed\nin detail with allowance for self-consistently produced radiation sources and sinks in the\nsimulation box and for cosmological effects, i.e., radiation transfer for the mean field J\u03bd is\ncomputed with stellar, quasar and bremsstrahlung sources and sinks due to Ly\u03b1 clouds\netc. In addition, a local optical depth approximation is adopted to crudely mimic the\nlocal shielding effects: each cubic cell is flagged with six hydrogen \"optical depths\" on\nthe six faces, each equal to the product of neutral hydrogen density, hydrogen ionization\ncross section and scale height, and the appropriate mean from the six values is then\ncalculated; equivalent ones for neutral helium and singly-ionized helium are also computed.\nIn computing the global sink terms for the radiation field the contribution of each cell is\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nsubject to the shielding due to its own \"optical depth\". In addition, in computing the local\nionization and cooling/heating balance for each cell the same shielding is taken into account\nto attenuate the external ionizing radiation field.\nGSW energy and ejected metals are distributed into 27 local gas cells centered at\nthe stellar particle in question, weighted by the specific volume of each cell. We fix\nemass = 0.25. GSW energy injected into the IGM is included with an adjustable efficiency\n(in terms of rest-mass energy of total formed stars) of eGSW , which is normalized to\nobservations for our fiducial simulation with eGSW = 3 \u00d7 10\u22126 . If the ejected mass and\nassociated energy propagate into a vacuum, the resulting velocity of the ejecta would be\n(2eGSW /emass )1/2 c = 1469km/s. After the ejecta has accumulated an amount of mass\ncomparable to its initial mass, the velocity may slow down to a few hundred km/s. We\nassume this velocity would roughly correspond to the observed outflow velocities of LBGs\n(e.g., Pettini et al. 2002). We also make simulations with no GSW and with stronger GSW\nto investigate the effects of GSW on IGM.\nWe do not separately make any adjustments to fit to the observed distributions and\nevolution of metals, but assume a specific efficiency of metal formation, an \"yield\" (Arnett\n1996), y0 = 0.02, the percentage of stellar mass that is ejected back into IGM as metals.\nWe note that y0 = Zejectaemass ; since y0 = 0.02 and emass = 0.25, it implies that the ejecta\nmetallicity is Zejecta = 0.08 = 4 Z\u2299 . Metals in the IGM (assuming the standard solar\ncomposition) are followed as a separate variable (analogous to the total gas density) with\nthe same hydrocode. In addition, we implement another density variable to keep track of\nthe reprocessed, i.e., secondary metals in the ejecta, which is proportional to the metallicity\nof the gas from which the star was formed.\nSince we are interested in the metallicity of the IGM, it is legitimate to question\nwhether our adopted constant metal yield is reasonable. We can not answer this question\nfrom first principles. Rather, we will consider a physically motivated case, where the\nmetallicity yield is a function of gas metallicity out of which stars are formed. It is thought\nthat the initial mass function of stars formed out of low metallicity gas may contain\nrelatively more high mass stars thus produce a higher yield (for references to the original\nliterature see Ricotti & Ostriker 2004). We adopt this view and consider a scenario with\nvarying yield by making a correction to the computed yield as described below. We present\nresults for both the case of constant yield and metallicity dependent yield to indicate the\nuncertainties and/or adjustability of the results.\nLet the yield be y(Z). It can then be shown that the final corrected metallicity\nof a region with computed metallicity Zc will be Zv = Zc y(Zc )/(y0f (Zc )), where\nR\nf (Zc ) = (y(Zc)/Zc ) 0Zc dx/y(x). We somewhat arbitrarily set the form of y(Z) to be\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\ny(Z) = (5.0 + 45.0(1 \u2212 exp(\u2212Z/B))\u22121 , which gives y = 0.02 for Z \u226b B and y = 0.2 for\nZ \u226a B. Thus we have adopted a higher yield of 0.2 for metal-free stars, which may be a\nreasonable choice if IMF of metal-free stars are top-heavy (Woosley & Weaver 1995). The\ntransition metallicity B is uncertain but we use 10\u22123 Z\u2299 for the illustration (Bromm & Loeb\n2003; Fang & Cen 2004).\nThe results reported on here are based on new simulations of a WMAP-normalized\n(Spergel et al. 2003) cold dark matter model with a cosmological constant: \u03a9M = 0.29,\n\u03a9b = 0.047, \u03a9\u039b = 0.71, \u03c38 = 0.85, H0 = 100hkms\u22121 Mpc\u22121 = 70kms\u22121 Mpc\u22121 and n = 1.0.\nSeven simulations with varying box size, resolution and input physics are made, as listed\nin Table 1. Mass resolution is extremely important for an analysis of this type as it is the\nlowest mass systems in relatively low density regions that contain the stars which are most\nsuitable for contamination of the low and moderate density IGM. The mass resolutions are\nconsiderably better than those of most cosmological simulations, but the spatial resolution,\nwhile significantly inferior to that obtained in both the SPH and AMR schemes, is, we\nbelieve, adequate for the present purpose. The coarser spatial resolution among the listed\nsimulations is smaller than the Jeans length of photoionized IGM at z = 2 \u2212 4 by a factor\ngreater than 10 but only marginally resolve some small galaxies of total mass 109 M\u2299 . But\nour higher resolution simulation indicates that results are not significantly affected.\nThe first simulation (N432L11M) is our fiducial one with a GSW feedback that is\napproximately matched to observations of Lyman break galaxies. The second simulation\n(N432L11L) has negligible GSW, while the third simulation (N432L11H) has GSW energy\nthat is higher than the fiducial run by a factor of 5. The higher resolution run (N864L11M)\nhas twice as high spatial resolution but with all other physics fixed the same and is made to\ncheck the dependence of the results on the resolution and the convergence of the results on\nresolution. As will be shown below, a proper convergence has been achieved for the problem\nin hand. The larger simulation (N864L22M) is made to check the dependence of the results\non the box size and, as one would have expected, the 11h\u22121 Mpc box seems adequate for\nthe objects under investigation at high redshift. The last two simulations (N432L11M8 and\nN432L11M32) have the exact same input physics and resolutions as the fiducial run but\nwith the initial power spectrum cutoff at 8 and 32 cells, respectively, instead of 2 cells in\nthe fiducial run. These two runs were made with the purpose of isolating some of the effects\ndue to small galaxies forming from density fluctuations of high wave numbers.\nThe program used to generate synthetic Ly\u03b1 forest lines here is the same one used\nin our previous papers (Cen et al. 1994; Miralda-Escud\u00e9 et al. 1996). The only addition\nis that we have in addition the metal density, which allows detailed computations of\nmetallicity distributions in the Ly\u03b1 forest. All transmitted flux is computed with a FWHM\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\n\nTable 1.

The left panel is with GSW (Run 1: N432L11M) and the right panel without GSW\n(Run 2: N432L11L). It is clear that GSW do blow bubbles of hot gas, which occupy a\nradius typically of hundreds of kpc.\nBefore proceeding to compute the metallicity distribution in the Ly\u03b1 forest, it is\npertinent to ask if a substantial GSW feedback on the IGM may spoil the excellent\nagreement found between the predictions of the cold dark matter model and the observed\nLy\u03b1 forest (Cen et al. 1994; Zhang et al. 1995; Hernquist et al. 1996; Miralda-Escud\u00e9 et\nal. 1996; Rauch et al. 1997; Croft et al. 1999; McDonald et al. 2000). The recent work\nof Theuns et al. (2002) has clearly demonstrated that GSW mainly propagate in the\ndirections of lowest column density, and filaments (producing most of the Ly\u03b1 forest) are\nnot significantly affected by GSW. They show quantitatively that Ly\u03b1 forest statistics such\nas column density distribution and Doppler width distribution remain little changed and the\ngood agreement between cold dark matter model and observations is, to the zero-th order,\nunaltered by GSW to the concerned accuracies. Here we will confirm their conclusions.\nFigure 2 visually presents this point, showing little alteration of the density distributions\nin filaments. A joint examination of Figures 1,2 indicates that GSW prefer to travel in the\ndirections roughly perpendicular to the filaments, as found by Theuns et al. (2002).\nTo further demonstrate that GSW do not significantly alter the flux distribution of\nthe Ly\u03b1 forest, Figure 3 shows the probability distributions of transmitted flux fraction,\ndefined as F \u2261 exp(\u2212\u03c4 ), for the seven runs tabulated in Table 1. The fact that all the\nruns, except Runs 5 (N864L22M) and 7 (N432L11M32), nearly overlay with one another\nclearly shows that the effect of GSW on flux distribution and other derived quantities\n(such as column density distribution, etc.,) will remain relatively unaltered, retaining the\nprevious good agreement found between simulations and observations. The fact that the\nhigher resolution run (Run 4: N864L11M) agrees with lower resolution runs (Runs 1,2,3:\nN432L11M, N432L11L, N432L11H) suggests that our fiducial run (Run 1: N432L11M) has\nadequate resolution. The deviation of Run 5 (N864L22M) from the rest is due to cosmic\nvariance, while the deviation of Run 7 (N432L11M32) from the rest is a result of missing\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\n\nFig. 1.- Projected temperature of a slice of size 11 \u00d7 11h\u22122 Mpc2 comoving and a depth\nof 2.75h\u22121 Mpc comoving at redshift z = 3 with (left panel) and without (right) GSW,\nrespectively.

It is evident that, while Ly\u03b1 clouds with\ncolumn density NHI \u2265 1014 cm\u22122 are only affected modestly, those with NHI \u2264 1014 cm\u22122\nare increasingly affected. A closer examination suggests that roughly 25% of clouds with\nNHI \u2264 1014 cm\u22122 is seen to experience significant heating by the GSW, and the effect\ndecreases towards higher columns. However, we have checked the cloud velocity width\ndistributions with the and without GSW and do not find noticeable differences, suggesting\nan overall domination of peculiar velocities in broadening clouds. Combining observations\nof hydrogen lines with metal lines, which suffer less thermal boradening, however, may\nallow one to see the GSW heating effect in the low column density Ly\u03b1 forest, at least for\nsome individual cases with low peculiar velocity broadening.\nLet us now turn to the main point of the paper. Could the GSW transport metal\nenriched gas to raise the metallicity of low density regions to a level consistent with the\nobserved metallicity? Are there palpable signatures of GSW on Ly\u03b1 forest? Figure 5 shows\nthe spatial distribution of metallicity in the IGM with (left panel) and without (right panel)\nGSW. It is visible from Figures 5 that, while other, gravitational (e.g., Gnedin 1998) and\nhydrodynamic processes do transport metals to the vicinity (\u2264\u223c 100kpc) of galaxies without\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\n\nFig. 6.- shows the metallicity as a function of Ly\u03b1 cloud column density for Run 1\n(N432L11M) with two cases of metal yields: left panel with constant yield y0 = 0.02 and\nright panel with varying yield with a transition to higher yield at Z = 10\u22123 Z\u2299 , at z = 3. The\nfive curves in each panel correspond to 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 90% percentiles. The shaded\nregions indicate the observed median metallicity as a function of column density from Schaye\net al. (2003) with 1\u03c3 bounds.\nGSW (right panel of Figure 5), GSW appear to play a more important role to transport\nthe metals from galaxies to larger distances, in conjunction with other, gravitational and\nnon-gravitational processes. The \"metal bubbles\" (reddish bubbles seen in the left panel of\nFigure 5) have \u03c1metals /\u03c1gas \u223c 10\u22124 , indicating that these metal-contaminated regions are\nenriched to a metallicity close to 10\u22122 Z\u2299 .\nFigure 6 shows the metallicity as a function of Ly\u03b1 cloud column density for our\nfiducial run (Run 1: N432L11M) with two yield schemes. For the clouds within the range\nof column densities (NHI \u223c 1014 \u2212 1015 cm\u22122 ), where comparisons with observations can\nbe made, it is very encouraging that the agreement between observations and simulations\nis good, considering that our simulations have essentially only one free parameter for the\nmetal yield, which in turn is fixed based on theory of stellar interior and turns out also to\nbe required to match the metallicity of the intra-cluster gas (Arnaud et al. 1994; Mushotsky\net al. 1996; Mushotsky & Lowenstein 1997; Cen & Ostriker 1999b). A comparison between\nthe left and right panels suggests that, if there is a transition such that the metal yield from\nstars is significantly higher for nearly metal free gas, it seems that the transition is likely to\nhave occurred at Z \u2264 10\u22123 Z\u2299 , perhaps at Z \u223c 10\u22124 \u2212 10\u22123 Z\u2299 ; a transition at a higher gas\nmetallicity would over-enrich the IGM at the relevant densities.\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\n\nFig. 7.- shows the metallicity as a function of Ly\u03b1 cloud column density for Run 3\n(N432L11H, left panel) and Run 2 (N423L11L, right panel) with constant metal yield, at\nz = 3. The five curves in each panel correspond to 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, 90% percentiles.\nThe shaded regions indicate the observed median metallicity as a function of column density\nfrom Schaye et al. (2003) with 1\u03c3 bounds.\nHow sensitive are the results to the strength of GSW? Figure 7 shows the cases with\nGSW strength (energy) five times stronger than the fiducial run (left panel) and with no\nGSW (right panel). We see that both these cases are consistent with observations. This\nis because the Ly\u03b1 clouds with column densities in the range examined, where metallicity\ncan be observationally accurately determined, are mostly located in the filaments somewhat\nfurther away from galaxies and not substantially affected by GSW, consistent with Figure\n3. This indicates the metallicity of gas in Ly\u03b1 clouds with column density in the range\nNHI = 1014.5 \u2212 1015.5 cm\u22122 mainly reflects the local star formation history. Some effect\nof GSW is seen in the sense that higher GSW produces somewhat higher metallicity\nfor the Ly\u03b1 clouds in that column density range, but the differences are comparable to\nobservational uncertainties. As it turns out, metallicity of Ly\u03b1 clouds in the column density\nrange of NHI = 1014.5 \u2212 1015.5 cm\u22122 provides an insensitive test of GSW (see Figure 8 for a\nfurther demonstration).\nA more powerful discriminant may lie in the metallicity of lower column density\nclouds, to some of which GSW are able to transport metals, as visually seen in\nFigures (1,5). A closer comparison between left panels of Figures 6,7 (with GSW)\nand right panel of Figure 7 (without GSW) already reveals this signature: there are\ndramatic differences at NHI \u2264 1013.5 cm\u22122 , between simulation with GSW and without\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\n\nFig. 8.- shows mean metallicity as a function of gas density for three runs: fiducial with\nrealistic GSW (Run 1:N432L11M; solid curve), high GSW run (Run 3:N432L11H; dashed\ncurve) and no GSW run (Run 2:N432L11L, dotted curve) at z = 3.\nGSW, where NHI = 1013.5 cm\u22122 approximately corresponds to \u03c1/h\u03c1i \u2264 1 at z = 3,\nusing the formula relating column density to gas density in Schaye et al. (2003),\n\u03c1/h\u03c1i = 10(NHI /1015 cm\u22122 )2/3 [(1 + z)/4]\u22123 . Apparently GSW are able to transport\nmetals to some low density regions within which embedded star formation was inefficient,\npresumably in directions roughly perpendicular to the filaments as seen in Figures (1,5). In\nthe fiducial run with GSW (Run 1: N432L11M) there are about 25% of Ly\u03b1 clouds with\nNHI < 1013 cm\u22122 may have metallicity in excess of 10\u22122 Z\u2299 , whereas there is none in the run\nwithout GSW.\nTo elucidate this physical point, in Figure 8, we plot the mean metallicity as a function\nof gas density. We see the expected but now precisely quantified difference between runs\nwith GSW (solid and dashed curves) and without GSW (dotted curve): GSW are able to\ntransport metals to regions at \u03c1/h\u03c1i < 10, whereas without GSW most of the metals are\ntrapped in regions with \u03c1/h\u03c1i > 10. The mean metallicity is larger by a factor of (7, 40, 500)\nat \u03c1/h\u03c1i = (3, 1, 0.1) in Run 1 (N432L11M) than in Run 2 (N432L11L), with the difference\nbecoming still larger at lower \u03c1/h\u03c1i < 0.1. We see that without GSW mean metallicity is\na steep monotonic function of density, whereas with GSW there two are peaks, where the\nlower metallicity peak at \u03c1 = (0.01 \u2212 0.1)h\u03c1i represents metal enriched low density regions,\na signature of GSW, consistent with Figures (6,7). This is the most clear demonstration\nof the GSW effect on the metal enrichment of the IGM and a clear signature of GSW:\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\n\nFig. 9.- shows mean metallicity as a function of gas density for three runs: fiducial run\nwith realistic GSW (Run 1:N432L11M; solid curve), reduced small-scale power run at 8\ncells (Run 6:N432L11M8; dashed curve) and reduced small-scale power run at 32 cells (Run\n7:N432L11M32; dotted curve).\nwith increasing observational sensitivity one should expect to see the metallicity at lower\ndensity regions \u03c1/h\u03c1i < 1 increasing rather than decreasing. The existence of a metallicity\ntrough at NHI = 1013\u221214 cm\u22122 (Figures 6, 7) or \u03c1/h\u03c1i = 0.1 \u2212 1 (Figure 8) in the simulations\nwith GSW is a clear indication that GSW propagate anisotropically; in other words, some\nintermediate density region along filaments are relatively less affected. We note that metal\nenrichment from galaxies not resolved in our simulations (a few times 107 M\u2299 ) at earlier\nepochs is unlikely to be important compared to the observed levels, as shown by Norman,\nO'Shea, & Paschos (2004), but may put a somewhat higher metallicity floor for the case\nwithout GSW.\nWhat galaxies are responsible for transporting metals to the low density regions?\nFigure 9 shows a comparison between Runs 1,6,7 (N432L11M, N432L11M8, N432L11M32).\nThese vary in their high wavenumber cutoff corresponding to minimum halo mass\nMmin \u223c (\u03c0/kmax )3 h\u03c1i of 1.1 \u00d7 107 h\u22121 M\u2299 , 7.0 \u00d7 108 h\u22121 M\u2299 , 4.5 \u00d7 1010 h\u22121 M\u2299 , in Run 1\n(N432L11M), 6 (N432L11M8) and 7 (N432L11M32), respectively. We see that, while the\ndifference at \u03c1/h\u03c1i \u223c 103 where large galaxies are located is small between the runs, the\ndifference between Run 1 (N432L11M) and Run 7 (N432L11M32) is about 2.5 \u2212 5.0 and\nthe difference between Run 1 (N432L11M) and Run 6 (N432L11M8) is about 2 at the low\nmetallicity peak at \u03c1/h\u03c1i \u223c 0.01 \u2212 0.1. A simple interpretation of Figure 9 is that galaxies\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\nwith mass in the range (1.1 \u00d7 107 h\u22121 \u2212 4.5 \u00d7 1010 )h\u22121 M\u2299 all contribute to the metal\nenrichment of the lower density IGM, with approximately 25% from > 4.5 \u00d7 1010 h\u22121 M\u2299 ,\n50% from 7.0 \u00d7108 \u22124.5 \u00d71010 h\u22121 M\u2299 and 25% from < 7.0 \u00d7108 h\u22121 M\u2299 . The recent work by\nAguirre et al. (2001) has shown that massive galaxies at low redshift are not very effective\nin enriching the IGM to a relatively uniform degree. On the other hand, GSW from dwarf\ngalaxies at high redshift appear to be able to more effectively disperse metals relatively\nuniformly without traveling a very long distance (e.g., Schwarz, Ostriker, & Yahil 1975; Cen\n& Bryan 2001; Madau, Ferrara, & Rees 2001). Our results are fully consistent with these\nearlier works. We further analyze the simulations by removing a sphere of radius 1h\u22121 Mpc\naround each simulated Lyman Break Galaxy, identified as galaxies brighter than rest-frame\nV -band magnitude MV = \u221221, as most of the brightest galaxies in the simulation satisfy\nthe color-color selection criteria of LBGs used by observers (e.g. Nagamine 2002; Nagamine\net al. 2004a,b). The results (not shown) in a similar plot to Figure 6 are virtually identical\nto Figure 6. This indicates that the contribution from ongoing star forming massive galaxies\nis, as expected, negligible, simply because there is a lag due to finite GSW propagation\ntime. This is also in part because the massive galaxies do not make large contribution to\nmetal enrichment of the low density IGM, consistent with Figure 9 and earlier results of\nAguirre et al. (2001).\nTo better understand responsible galaxies for the metal enrichment of Ly\u03b1 forest,\nFigure 10 shows the ratio of mean secondary metallicity to mean primary metallicity as a\nfunction of column density. Within galaxies, the ratio of secondary to primary metals is\nproportional to the ratio primary/hydrogen. Thus higher values of S/P indicate an origin of\nmetals in more massive, more metal rich systems. The most striking feature in this figure is\nthe dramatic decrease of the ratio from \u223c 1 in the highest column density clouds to about\n0.003 \u2212 0.02 in the low column density clouds, a drop of a factor of 50 \u2212 300, for the fiducial\nmodel (red curve). Quantitatively, we see that the ratio of secondary (e.g., N) to primary\nmetals (e.g., O,C) is expected to be smaller by a factor of 10 in clouds of NHI \u223c 1014.5 cm\u22122\ncompared to that in large galaxies and by a factor of \u2265 50 for NHI \u2264 1013.5 cm\u22122 . This can\nbe most easily understood and consistent with Figure 9, if most of the metal enrichment of\nLy\u03b1 forest is due to dwarf galaxies (Dekel & Silk 1986; Mac Low & Ferrara 1999; Madau,\nFerrara, & Rees 2001), where gas retainment is more difficult and thus metal recycling is\nlimited.\nSome other interesting features are also present in Figure 10. A comparison among\nthe red solid, blue long-dashed (with GSW) and green dotted curves (no GSW) reveals a\ncouple of noticeable properties. First, the runs with GSW show an upturn of the ratio at\nNHI < 1013.5 cm\u22122 , although the level is still a factor of 50 \u2212 100 below the high density\nregions. The fact there is an upturn and a valley at NHI \u223c 1013.5 cm\u22122 shows that the\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\n\nFig. 10.- shows secondary to primary metal ratio as a function of column density for five\nruns at z = 3. The units on the y-axis is relative and normalized to have the maximum of\nunity (normally in the densest regions).\nmetals transported to the lowest density regions with NHI < 1013.5 cm\u22122 are somewhat\nmore recycled through stars than regions at NHI \u223c 1013.5 cm\u22122 and originate in higher\nmetallicity systems. This may be explained if the metals are largely transported by winds\nfrom galaxies at densest peaks, where relatively more recycling has occurred, whereas near\nNHI \u223c 1013.5 cm\u22122 star formation and enrichment are largely local and recent. Second,\nincreasing the strength of GSW causes more-recycled metals to be transported to low\ndensity regions, as expected. Comparison of the two runs with reduced small-scale power\n(Runs 6,7; long-dashed cyan and dot-dashed magenta curves) and the fiducial run (Run 1,\nsolid red curve) shows that artificial removal of small-scale power thus low mass galaxies\nsignificantly reduces the overall values of the ratio of secondary to primary metals of Ly\u03b1\nforest concerned here, while the upturn at the low column density end is preserved. This\nis of course easily understandable, since much of previous generation of stars can no longer\nform without the small-scale power. This again highlights the need to have high enough\nkmax in the initial density field.\nFinally, Figure 11 shows the mean and median metallicity as a function of density\nat three redshifts, z = 2, 3, 4, with GSW (left panel) and without GSW (right panel).\nBoth runs show only mild evolution in the median metallicity, consistent with observations\n(Schaye et al. 2003): most of the contamination of the IGM was completed at a relatively\nhigh redshift. But the run with GSW shows considerable evolution for the mean metallicity\n\n\f\u2013 20 \u2013\n\nFig. 11.- shows the mean metallicity (solid curves) and median metallicity (dashed curves)\nas a function of Ly\u03b1 cloud column density at redshift z = 2, 3, 4 (thick to thin) for Run 1\n(N432L11M, left panel) and for Run 2 (N432L11L, right panel).\nat \u03c1/h\u03c1i < 10, whereas the run with GSW does not show significant evolution even for the\nmean metallicity at all densities.\n\n4.\n\nConclusions\n\nWe use the latest high mass resolutions hydrodynamic simulation of a \u039bCDM model\nto compute the metallicity evolution of the Ly\u03b1 forest. Our primary goal is to investigate\npossible signatures of galactic superwinds on the metallicity of the Ly\u03b1 forest. There are\nthree main points to be noted.\nFirst, GSW do not significantly alter the flux distribution of Ly\u03b1 forest and the\nagreement found in previous simulations of cold dark matter model with observations\nremains unchanged. On the other hand, GSW do increase the temperature of clouds with\ncolumn density NHI < 1013.5 cm\u22122 , although their contribution to the observed cloud width\ndistribution will be difficult to detect due to large peculiar velocities.\nSecond, the computed metallicity of Ly\u03b1 clouds in the column density range of\nNHI \u223c 1014.5 \u2212 1015.5 cm\u22122 at z = 2 \u2212 4, both with and without GSW, is in reasonable\nagreement with observations (Schaye et al. 2003). This suggests that these Ly\u03b1 clouds do\nnot provide a sensitive test of GSW.\n\n\f\u2013 21 \u2013\nFinally, we find a unique signature and sensitive test of GSW, which lies in the still\nlower density regions with gas density of \u03c1/h\u03c1i = 0.01 \u2212 1.0 and a corresponding column\ndensity of NHI \u223c 1012 \u2212 1014 cm\u22122 . Without GSW we predict that both the mean and\nmedian metallicity of Ly\u03b1 clouds in this column density range at z = 2 \u2212 4 should have\nZ \u2264 10\u22123 Z\u2299 . With GSW, however, there is a significant fraction (\u223c 25%) of Ly\u03b1 clouds in\nthis column density range which have a high metallicity excess of 10\u22122 Z\u2299 , resulting in a\nmean metallicity of \u223c 10\u22122 Z\u2299 . If we (artificially) reduce the number of low mass galaxies\n(M \u2264 4.5 \u00d7 1010 h\u22121 M\u2299 ), the contamination of the low column density clouds by GSW\nis reduced by a factor of \u223c 4, so it is likely the mass and metal loss from these low mass\nsystems at z > 3 (cf. Dekel & Silk 1986) is the origin of the metals. There is a potential test\nof this hypothesis. Since reprocessing of metals in these low mass systems is negligible the\nratio of secondary (e.g., N) to primary metals (e.g., O,C) is very low and indeed, when we\nexamine this tracer, we find that the ratio of secondary to primary metals is expected to be\nsmaller by a factor of 10 and \u2265 50 for clouds of NHI \u223c 1014.5 cm\u22122 and NHI \u2264 1013.5 cm\u22122 ,\nrespectively, compared to that in large galaxies. Thus, future observations of N/O or N/C\nwould help provide an additional test of our proposal. In addition, we find that there is\na minimum in the median metallicity for clouds of NHI \u223c 1013 \u2212 1014 cm\u22122 in the case\nwith GSW, whereas without GSW the metallicity decrease monotonically and rapidly with\ndecreasing column density.\nWe thank Len Cowie and Piero Madau for useful discussion.
