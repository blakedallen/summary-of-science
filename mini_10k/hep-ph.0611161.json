In this talk, relying on experience with various lattice filter techniques, we argue that the\nsemiclassical structure of finite temperature gauge fields for T < Tc is dominated by calorons with\nnon-trivial holonomy. By simulating a dilute gas of calorons with identical holonomy, superposed\nin the algebraic gauge, we are able to reproduce the confining properties below Tc up to distances\nr = O(4fm) >> \u03c1 (the caloron size). We compute Polyakov loop correlators as well as space-like\nWilson loops for the fundamental and adjoint representation. The model parameters, including the\nholonomy, can be inferred from lattice results as functions of the temperature.\nKeywords: Yang-Mills theory, lattice, caloron, non-trivial holonomy, confinement\nPACS: 11.15.Ha, 11.10.Wx, 12.38.Gc\n\nInstanton or caloron models of QCD successfully describe many non-perturbative features of hadron physics, in particular chiral symmetry breaking and the UA (1) anomaly\n(for reviews see [1, 2]). However, they fail to describe confinement unless they are\nendowed with long-range correlations. This is the case for instantons in the regular\ngauge [3] and has been discussed also at this conference [4]. An attractive alternative,\nat least for non-zero temperature T , is based on new caloron solutions with non-trivial\nholonomy [5, 6, 7, 8], worked out in various aspects by Kraan and van Baal. At this\nsymposium we were happy to listen to a review talk [9] by Pierre van Baal after his\nrecovery.\nThe new caloron solutions - we call them KvBLL calorons - have characteristic\nproperties which distinguish them from the old BPST instantons [10] or HarringtonShepard (HS) calorons [11]. Like the latter, the new calorons are (anti)selfdual with\ninteger topological charge and periodic in Euclidean time with the period 1/T . The\ndifference is a non-trivial asymptotic behaviour of A4 (x) such that the Polyakov loop\n\uf8eb 1/T\n\uf8f6\nP(~x) = P\u0302 exp \uf8edi\n\nZ\n0\n\nA4 (~x,t)dt \uf8f8\n\n|~x|\u2192\u221e\n\n=\u21d2 P\u221e\n\n(1)\n\ncan take arbitrary fixed values P\u221e \u2208\n/ Z(Nc ) at spatial infinity.

M\u00fcller-Preussker at Quark Confinement and Hadron Structure VII, Ponta Delgada, Azores,\nPortugal, September 2 - 7, 2006\n\n\fPolyakov loop P(~x) has degenerated eigenvalues. For SU (2) this means that L(~x) =\n1\n2 trP(~x) takes opposite values \u00b11 at the positions of the two monopoles. The profile of\nthe Polyakov loop field inside a KvBLL solution is the most significant feature of the\nnew calorons irrespective whether the constituents or 'instanton quarks' are separated\nor not. If the constituents are far from each other the caloron dissociates into Nc static\nnon-Abelian monopoles. The topological charge of either lump then depends on the\neigenvalue differences of P\u221e . The zero modes of the Dirac operator are localized only\nat one of the constituents. When the fermionic boundary condition is smoothly changed\nthe zero mode jumps from one constituent to another [12] if these are separated.\nFirst we used the cooling method applying it to pure SU (2) and SU (3) lattice Monte\nCarlo gauge fields. We demonstrated that the lumps of topological charge observed in\nthe plateau configurations have to be interpreted in terms of KvBLL calorons [13,\n14]. Closer to the deconfinement transition or for a smaller aspect ratio we found an\nincreasing frequency of dissociated monopole pairs in SU (2).\nMore recently we have studied Monte Carlo lattice fields with the 4d smearing method\nat different temperatures [15]. We found many clusters of topological charge and classified them with respect to their Abelian monopole content (in the maximally Abelian\ngauge). Two limiting cases suggest an interpretation in terms of KvBLL constituents or\ncalorons: (i) clusters containing a monopole loop winding around the lattice in the time\ndirection, taken as candidates for a single constituent; (ii) clusters containing a closed\nmonopole loop, taken as candidates for undissociated calorons. For these cases we have\nestimated the topological charge of the cluster, Qcluster , and the Polyakov loop averaged\nover the positions of time-like Abelian monopoles, < PL >cluster . In the confinement\nphase - i.e. for maximally non-trivial holonomy - we would expect half-integer topological charges for isolated monopoles and integer charge for full calorons. The averaged\nPolyakov loop should be close to \u00b11 for isolated monopoles and near zero for calorons\naccording to the \"dipole\" profile of the Polyakov loop inside the KvBLL caloron. What\nis really observed is seen in the scatter plots in the (Qcluster , < PL >cluster )-plane of\nFig. 1. Each entry corresponds to one of the selected cluster candidates, and the scatter plot is clustering into classes with the expected signatures. In the deconfined phase\n(not shown), for holonomies closer to the trivial one we would expect to find disbalanced constituents, one with small action and a complementary one with large action.\nApart from few full calorons accounting for the topological charge of the configurations, we found many \"single-constituent\" clusters with static Abelian monopole loops\nbut small topological charge, whereas constituents with topological charges close to \u00b11\nwere completely missing. We conclude that the model picture of KvBLL calorons may\nfail in the deconfinement phase.\nOne can also study the topological content without cooling or smearing techniques by\napplying purely fermionic methods to equilibrium fields. Such investigations have also\nprovided indications for the presence of KvBLL monopole constituents [16, 17].\nWhat are the consequences if HS calorons are replaced by KvBLL ones as building\nblocks in a random caloron gas model at finite T ? Such a model, so far realized in the\nSU (2) case [18], requires to start the superposition in the so-called algebraic gauge for\nwhich A4 (x) decreases sufficiently fast. A non-periodic gauge transformation is applied\nin order to render the gauge field periodic. This restricts us to superpositions of calorons\n\n\f2\n\n1\n\n1\nQ_cluster\n\nQ_cluster\n\n2\n\n0\n-1\n\n0\n-1\n\n-2\n-1\n\n0\n-0.5\n0.5\n<PL(Abelian monopoles)>_cluster\n\n1\n\n-2\n-1\n\n0\n-0.5\n0.5\n<PL(Abelian monopoles)>_cluster\n\n1\n\nFIGURE 1.

For a statistically uncorrelated caloron gas the actual density n(T )\ncan be inferred from lattice computations of the topological susceptibility. The average\nsize was fixed by comparison between model and lattice results for the spatial string\ntension in units of the critical temperature which then turned out to be Tc \u2243 178MeV.\nThe holonomy P\u221e \u2261 exp(2\u03c0 i\u03c9\u03c43) was identified with the (renormalized) Polyakov\nloop. More details and references can be found in [18]. For some parameter sets see\nTable 1.\nOn a lattice grid we have computed spatial Wilson loops as well as Polyakov loop\ncorrelators, both within fundamental and adjoint representations. The spatial string\ntension is seen to drop at Tc , because the mechanism responsible for the observed rise are\nnot the monopoles that are part of the calorons and suppressed at T > Tc . This problem\ncorresponds to our observation, in the smeared configurations reported above, of many\nmonopoles with low accompanying topological charge. The results for the free energy of\na static quark-antiquark pair are shown in Fig. 2.

Such a model turns out to describe confinement with parameters which are rather close to standard instanton model assumptions.\nKeeping all parameters fixed, merely changing the holonomy from \u03c9 = 1/4 to \u03c9 = 0\nor 1/2, removes the linear rise completely [18]. This underscores the r\u00f4le of non-trivial\nholonomy and the corresponding long-range nature of the caloron fields.\nWe are grateful to P. van Baal, F. Bruckmann, C. Gattringer, A.
