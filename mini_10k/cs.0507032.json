D. Ogden\nro01@txstate.edu\nRevised November 2, 2005\nAbstract\nAccording to Landauer's Principle the annihilation (and presumably\nthe creation) of one bit costs at least kT ln(2) much energy. This seems\nto imply that serial bit transmission is impossible; however, a complete\nquantum theory of communication should permit Alice to send Bob a\nmessage of arbitrary length, unknown\nto Bob \u0001in advance. One is lead\nP\u221e\n2 \u2297n\n, where C2 is convento consider the Hilbert state space\nn=0 C\ntional qubit space, but the obvious operator which appends a 0 (say) to\na string x (i.e., sends | x i to | x0 i ) is no longer unitary on this space\nbecause it is not onto . The remedy proposed in this report is to use l2\n(FG(2)) for the quantum message space (QMS), where FG (2) is the\nfree group on the bit symbols {0,1}; the \"anti-bits\" 0\u22121 and 1\u22121 , represented by 2 and 3 respectively, are introduced, and thus the conservation\nlaws are retained. After developing the basic QMS constructs we describe\nthe message-length observable N , noting that most quantum operators\nused hitherto in quantum information theory commute with N . In\nQMS the operation which appends a string to a message is implemented\nby a right translation operator. We review the harmonic analysis on the\nfree group FG (2) and the decomposition of the right regular representation into irreducible representations of FG (2). This decomposition is\nimplemented by the spectral analysis of the operator A , which is left\nconvolution by (| 0 i+| 1 i+| 2 i+| 3 i)/ 4 . This analysis yields a family\nof projectors which commute with the extended qubit operations implemented by the right regular representation and therefore can be used to\nconstruct quantum operators for quantum computation on QMS.\nIndex Terms\u2013Quantum information theory, harmonic analysis, free group,\nEigenvalues and eigenfunctions, Hilbert spaces, Message systems, Operators (mathematics).\n\n1\n\n\fI.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nIn classical communication theory a binary-encoded message source generates\nbit strings according to the underlying source statistics, those of an ergodic\nstochastic process. In general, messages of arbitrary length may be generated.\nMoreover, in classical communication theory it is convenient to conceive of the\nbits in a message being generated serially one at a time.\nIn much of quantum computation theory the message length is assumed known;\ni.e., N -qubits are studied with N, the number of qubits, fixed. The underlying Hilbert space is then a 2N dimensional complex space with a complete\northogonal set of normalized pure states indexed by the strings of length N.\nFurthermore, it is often assumed that the \"noise\" in the quantum communication channel preserves N , but it has been argued that there is no physical\nnecessity for this.\nIn contrast, quantum message space permits strings of arbitrary length; it contains an orthonormal list ( \u03b4a ) of orthonormal state vectors indexed by\na\u2208\n2* = the set of all bit strings. The message is then an observable whose value\na is a (possibly empty) bit string. If \u033a is the a priori state before measurement,\nthe probability that the message received equals a is h\u03b4a | \u033a (\u03b4a )i /Trace(\u033a) .\nWhen a measurement is made with result a (i.e., a quantum message whose\nvalue is a is received), the system state becomes h\u03b4a |\u033a(\u03b4a )i \u03b4a \u2297\u03b4a\u2217 , where the\noperator \u03b1\u2297\u03b2 \u2217 is defined by \u03b1\u2297\u03b2 \u2217 (\u03c6)=h\u03b2 | \u03c6i \u03b1 . Let H+ = Hilbert space\ngenerated by (\u03b4a )a\u22082\u2217 . A state \u033a supported by H+ represents a \"positive\"\nmessage source; i.e., one whose value is a (possibly empty) string of 0 s and\n1 s.\nThe space H+ would seem to be a natural candidate for a quantum state space\nwhich allows messages of arbitrary length, but it leaves no provision for bit creation. The obvious process of bit creation by appending is implemented by the\noperator V b which maps \u03b4a to \u03b4ab , where b \u2208 2 is a bit; e.g., V0 (\u03b4001 )=\u03b40010\n. V b leaves H+ invariant and acts as an isometry thereon, but this map is not\nonto , thence it is not unitary. This is consistent with Landauer's principle[NG]:\nsince at least kT ln(2) much energy is required to erase a bit, presumably at\nleast that much energy is needed to create a new bit. Thus it would seem that\nserial bit generation is not possible in a closed system.\nThe operations of appending and deleting bits evoke the creation operators\n(e.g., Vb ) and annihilation operators (Vb\u2217 ) of quantum field theory. The formal\nanalogues of momentum and position would be the real and imaginary parts\nof Vb . The empty string is sort of like the vacuum from which everything\nis created. But the (anti-)commutation relations are disappointing and trivial;\nwith hindsight this is so because 2\u2217 is a free semi-group.\nBut there is a precedent in atomic physics for evading conservation laws by\npostulating a new \"particle\" with the necessary properties for balancing the\nequations; in such a way the positron and neutrino were first proposed, by\nPauli/Dirac and E. Fermi, and sure enough physical evidence turned up that\n\n2\n\n\fseemed to confirm their reality, which today is an established fact of physics.\nIn this paper anti-qubits are proposed, which do make the appending of a bit\na unitary operation, balanced by effects on anti-qubits and mixtures. But in\nthis case we are ignorant of any physical basis in new particles or fields, but of\nnew relations within infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces suitable for modelling\na quantum message space which permits bit generation and messages of arbitrary length unknown in advance.\nThe basic references for quantum mechanics used in this report are Mackey,\n\"Mathematical Foundations of Quantum Mechanics\" [Ma] and the standard reference of Nielsen and Chaung, \"Quantum Computation and Quantum Information\"\n[NG]. [PS] is a suggested reference for quantum field theory.\nSpecial thanks to Carl Brannen for a close critical reading and various helpful\nsuggestions.\n\nII. THE FREE GROUP FG(2):\nAND CONVENTIONS\n\nENCODINGS\n\nA. Strings\n2n refers to the set of integers {0,1,2,3,...,2n-1}, or the set of bit strings of length\nn, or the simply the number 2n , depending on the context. The set of all bit\nstrings 2\u2217 = \u222an\u22650 2n forms a semigroup with identity under the operation of\nstring concatenation.\nWhen we complete 2\u2217 as a group we get the free group with two generators,\nFG(2) . We will use 0 and 1 for the group generators, and denote 0\u22121 and\n1\u22121 by 2 and 3 respectively. The set of generators and their inverses is the\nalphabet for the free group, so for FG(2) this shall be 4 = {0,1,2,3} . 0 and\n1 are bits that make up positive messages; 2 and 3 (in this context) are the\nanti-bit values. The free group identity is the empty string \u039b . The inverse\nmap on 4 is the map inv: 0 \u2192 2, 1\u2192 3, 2 \u2192 0, 3 \u21921, a\u2192 a\u22121 .\nIn a free group there are no simplifications possible except that of removing\ndigrams consisting of an alphabet symbol and its inverse:\naa\u22121 . In the\npresent context this means that any of the four substrings 02,13,20,31 may be\nremoved from an expression representing a free group element. A string in 4\u2217\nwhich does not contain one of these four substrings is a reduced word.\n\nB. The Free Group\nThe free group on two elements FG(2) is the subset of 4\u2217 consisting of all\nreduced words. The group operation is string concatenation followed by reduction, \u039b is the identity element and the inverse of the reduced word is the string\n\n3\n\n\fof the inverse alphabet symbols, in reverse order.\nFG(2)n = FG ( 2 )\u2229 4n = all reduced words of length n. The group operations\non FG(2) are simply\nx * y = reduce (x y) . If\nx =x0 ...xn\u22121 then x\u22121 =inv(xn\u22121 )...inv(x0 ) .\nExample: 03221211*3300123=032210123=(103230012)\u22121\n.\nThe mathematical significance of the free group FG(2) is given any group G\nand pair of elements a and b, then there is a unique homomorphism from\nFG(2) onto the subgroup of G generated by {a,b} which sends 0 to a and 1\nto b. The significance for quantum communication theory may be due to its\nbeing the natural mathematical structure which allows for bit generation as a\nunitary operation.\nNote we have the inclusions 2n \u2282FG(2)n \u22824n .\n\nC. Definition Of Quantum Message Space (QMS)\nA quantum message space is a Hilbert space H together with an orthonormal\nbasis (\u03b4a )a\u2208FG(2) indexed by the elements of the free group FG(2) on the two bit\nvalues {0,1}. The basis induces a unique atomic spectral measure M mapping\nsubsets A \u2286 FG(2) to orthogonal projectors:\nX\nM (A) =\n\u03b4a \u2297 \u03b4a\u2217 , A \u2286 FG(2)\n(1)\na\u2208A\n\nThe elements of FG(2), the reduced strings, are the outcome of measurements of the discrete observable determined by M. Thus the measured message\nis a reduced substring on {0,1,2,3} . Strings of 0s and 1s are reduced; such\nstrings might be called positive messages.\nLet (\u03c6,\u03c8) \u2192 h\u03c6 | \u03c8i denote the inner product on H, anti-linear in \u03c6. Any\nquantum state \u033a in message space can be interpreted as a message source. It\ninduces a probability distribution on the messages, x \u2208 FG(2) having weight\nh\u03b4x |\u033a(\u03b4x )i/Trace(\u033a)=probability that the message \"received\" is x. If the outcome of the measurement is message x then the a posteriori state is the pure\nstate h\u03b4x |\u033a(\u03b4x )i\u03b4x \u2297\u03b4x\u2217 .\nThe message source entropy in the quantum message space is\nX\n\nx\u2208FG(2)\n\n\u03b7(h\u03b4x | \u033a (\u03b4x )i /Trace(\u033a)), where \u03b7(p) = \u2212p ln(p),0 < p \u2264 1, \u03b7(0) = 0\n\nThis entropy depends on the choice of the particular basis (\u03b4a ) ; it is not the\nsame as the von Neumann entropy = Trace(\u03b7(\u033a)), but as shown in appendix A\nthe von Neumann entropy is a lower bound for the source entropy with respect\nto (\u03b4a ).\n\n4\n\n\fMessage Length Observable:\n\n1)\n\nThe message length #x is an important observable which we denote\nby N . Formally, we equate N with the unbounded self-adjoint operator\nN=\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nnM (FG(2)n )\n\n(2)\n\nn=0\n\nThe average message length of the quantum message source \u033a is\nP\nx\u2208FG(2) #x h\u03b4x |\u033a (\u03b4x )i/ Trace(\u033a) = Trace(N\u033a), which may be infinite.\nNote that #FG(2)0 = 1, and for n>0, #FG(2)n = 4 * 3n\u22121 .\nThus the positive semi-definite operator N has the property that the\nmultiplicity of an eigenvalue grows exponentially with the size of the eigenvalue.\nAfter a measurement of N (but not of the message itself) the state becomes\nM (FG(2)n )\u033aM (FG(2)n ),\nwhere n is the result of the measurement. In the aposteriori state\nthe observable N has the definite value n. A state \u03b8 wherein the\nmessage has definite length n has the property that \u03b8N = n\u03b8,\nand therefore N \u03b8 = \u03b8N = \u03b8N \u03b8. It follows that\nX\nh\u03b4x |\u03b8 (\u03b4y )i \u03b4x \u2297 \u03b4y\u2217 .\n(3)\n\u03b8=\nx,y\u2208FG(2)n\n\nIf \u03b8 is also a positive message state, \u03b8 =\n\nX\n\nx,y\u22082n\n\nh\u03b4x |\u03b8 (\u03b4y )i \u03b4x \u2297 \u03b4y\u2217 .\n\nIn particular, an extended n-qubit is a pure stateof the\nform \u03c8 \u2297 \u03c8 \u2217 in which N has the definite value n : N (\u03c8)=n\u03c8.\nA conventional n-qubit is a (normally normalized) pure state in which\n\u03c8 \u2208 Span {\u03b4x : x \u2208 2n } . Such a state represents a positive n-bit message.\nIt is interesting to explore the dynamics of a quantum system with\nHamiltonian H = h\u03bdN . Here h is Planck\u2032 s constant and \u03bd > 0 is some\npositive constant frequency.

This index\ngives a measure of the extent this assumption is correct. In particular, there are\nstates in QMS which allow transitions which change the message length.\n2)\n\nj th Qubit Observable:\n\nWhat is the value of a particular bit (or extended bit)? If we\nconsider the jth extended bit of a message its value can be 0, 1, 2, 3,\nor \u2212 1 representing the case where the message length is not more than j,\nso the jth bit is not defined. Formally,\n\nXj = (\u22121)M (\u222ak\u2264j FG(2)k )+\n\n3\nX\nb=0\n\nbM ({x \u2208 FG(2) : #x > j and xj = b}) (7)\n\nEach vector of the form \u03b4yaz where y, z \u2208 FG(2)\nand #y = j is an eigenvectorofX j for the eigenvalue a \u2208 4;\nthe corresponding state is such that the measurement of the jth extended bit always\nyields a. Observe that the operators (Xj )j\u22650 together with N determine the\natomic measure M completely since we know the message if we know the length\n\n6\n\n\fand the value of the extended qubit at every position less than the length. Finally,\nthe jth qubit is represented by the observable\n\nQj = \u2212M ({x : #x \u2264 j or xj \u2208 {2, 3})+\n\n3)\n\n1\nX\nb=0\n\nbM ({x \u2208 FG(2) : #x > j and xj = b})\n(8)\n\nQuantum Message Source:\n\nThe component of state \u033a that is co-measurable with N is the state \u033aN . The\nstates \u033a and \u033aN are identical as message-generating sources, since\nfor x \u2208 FG(2)n , h\u03b4x |\u033a (\u03b4x )i = h\u03b4x |\u033an (\u03b4x )i = h\u03b4x |\u033aN (\u03b4x )i .\nNow every\nP quantum state is also an observable because it is a self-adjoint operator\n\u033a=\nr rEr where the orthogonal sum is over r \u2208 spectrum(\u033a). The\npossible measured values are the elements r. If we measure \u033a while in the\nstate \u033a the probability that the outcome is r equals mr r/Trace(\u033a),\nwhere mr is the multiplicity of r as an eigenvalue of \u033a. The a posteriori state\nis rEr and further measurements of \u033a always yield r with no change\nof state. In the special case that \u033a is a pure state \u03c8 \u2297 \u03c8 \u2217 the measurement\n2\nalways\nP\u221e yields \u2217 \u03c8| with probability one. As we have seen in this case \u033aN =\nn=0 \u03c8n \u2297 \u03c8n , and this is always a mixed state unless \u03c8 is an eigenvector\nof N . Now if we measure \u03c8 \u2297 \u03c8 \u2217 the result is \u03c8|2 with probability\n\u2217\n\nindex (N ,\u03c8 \u2297 \u03c8 ) =\n4)\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nn=0\n\n\u03c8n |4 / \u03c8|4 < 1 in general.\n\nSome Examples;\n\n.According to results in [KB] the maximum entropy probability\nmeasure on FG(2) with a fixed average message length \u03bc is\n\u03bc\n.\ngiven by w(x) = (1 \u2212 p) pn / #FG(2)n where n = #x and p = 1+\u03bc\np\nP\nLet \u03c8 = x\u01ebFG(2) w(x)\u03b4x . As a message source the pure\nstate \u03c8 \u2297 \u03c8 \u2217 is such that the probability of receiving\nx is w(x).\nP\nNow consider the highly mixed state \u03c3 = x w(x)\u03b4x \u2297 \u03b4x\u2217 . As\na message source \u03c3 induces the same probability distribution\non the messages as \u03c8 \u2297 \u03c8 \u2217 .The entropy of this distribution is\nlog(3/p) p/(1-p) + log(4/3) - log(1-p); as \u03bc \u2192 \u221e the entropy is asymptotic to\nlog(3)\u03bc .\nBut the von Neumann entropy for \u03c8\u2297\u03c8 \u2217 is zero because it is a pure state,\nwhereas the von Neumann entropy of \u03c3 equals the source entropy.\n\n7\n\n\fD. Positive Messages\nLet H+ be the Hilbert space spanned by {\u03b4y : y\u01eb2\u2217 }. H+ is\nthe positive message state space of ordinary bit-string messages. The\northogonal projector onto H+ is M (2\u2217 ) as in (1) above.The operator\nN + = M (2\u2217 ) N M (2\u2217 ) has many properties analogous to those of N .\nThe state change wrought by a test for positivity with no information about the outcome\nchanges \u033a to M (2\u2217 ) \u033a M (2\u2217 )+(I \u2212 M (2\u2217 )) \u033a(I \u2212 M (2\u2217 )) and the trace is preserved,\nbut a state change from \u033a to M (2\u2217 ) \u033aM (2\u2217 ) which occurs when the test result\nis affirmative will of course provide information and reduce the trace of the state.\nMultiplication inFG(2) restricted to 2\u2217 is merely concatenation of bit strings. The\nmultiplication derived from the concatenation product of basis vectors indexed by\nmulti-qubits extends to a product on H+ which is the completionof the tensor algebra on the\ntwo-dimensional Hilbert space spanned by the reference qubits|0i and|1i. In quantum\ncomputation\u03b4y is often written as |yi (ket form) and \u03b4y\u2217 as hy| (bra form) so for example\n\u2217\n\u03b41101 \u2297 \u03b41101\nmay be written more compactly as |1101ih1101| .\nHere is a sample computation :\n(\u22121|0i+3|00i\u2212i|10i)\u2217(|\u039bi+ |1i+|01i) = \u2212|0i+3|00i\u2212i|10i\u2212|01i+2|001i \u2212i|101i +3|0001i \u2212i|1001i\nThis multiplication is precisely convolution on FG(2). The QMS H is the extension\nof H+ analogous to the extension of the semigroup 2\u2217 to the group FG(2).\nOn the other hand, perhaps some physical constraint restricts our message\nmeasurements to 2\u2217 . Many data-processing operations F in QMS would\nhave as a goal the maximization of Trace(M(2\u2217 ) F (\u033a)M(2\u2217 ) )/Trace(\u033a) subject\nto some bounds on Trace(\u033a). However, the operator F need not preserve states\nsupported by H+ . The positive message observable's spectral measure is\nM + , which is the atomic measure for the observable taking values in 2\u2217 \u222a{(-)},\nwhere (-) stands for any fixed thing not in 2\u2217 :\nM + ({a}) = \u03b4a \u2297 \u03b4a\u2217 for a \u2208 2\u2217 , M + ({(\u2212)}) = M (FG(2) \u223c 2\u2217 ) = I \u2212 M + (2\u2217 ).\nQuantum message space contains all the usual spaces for quantum circuits :\nSpan {\u03b4x : x \u2208 2n } = Range (M (2n )) \u2248 C2 \u2248 C\u2297n , the space of n-qubits.\nn\n\nQMS can absorb the tensor product of two such spaces such as C\u2297k representing k control bits with C\u2297m data bits. The usual quantum operators of\nconventional quantum circuit theory can all be extended trivially to H+ ; the\nextensions to H are not so obvious.\n\nE. Data Processing on Messages\nA data-processing operation on states in QMS is implemented by a quantumoperation [NC],\nwhich in this context means a real linear operator F on the self-adjoint operators of\n8\n\n\ftrace class on H which is strictly positive and non-trace-increasing. In particular,\nif \u033a is a message state then so is F (\u033a), and 0 < Trace(F (\u033a)) \u2264\n\u0010 Trace(\u033a).\u0011The\n(\u033a))\ninformation lost by the system(or entropy gained?) is \u2212 log2 Trace(F\n.\nTrace(\u033a)\nIf equality holds for all states \u033a then F is trace-preserving;\nthe interpretation is that the state change \u033a \u2192 F (\u033a) generates no information,\ndoes not increase entropy, and is often reversible. An example of such an operation is\nK(U )(\u033a) = U \u033aU \u2217 , where U is a unitary operator on the QMS H. An example\nof a quantum operation which is not reversible is the measurement of an observable,\nof a projector P say, with 1 as the result of the measurement. We have Q(P )(\u033a)=P \u033aP . If\nwe measure P without changing the entropy of the system the a posteriori state is\nT (P )(\u033a) = Q(P )(\u033a) + Q(I \u2212 P )(\u033a)\nCertainother\ntrace-preserving operations can be built up from orthogonal projectors (Pj )\nP\nP\n= I and associated unitary operators (Uj ) :\nsuch that\nj\nj\nlet T (U, P )(\u033a) =\n\nX\n\nUj Pj \u033aPj Uj\u2217 , assuming the range of the index j is finite.\n\nj\n\nIf a measurement of the index is made with result k the state becomes Pk \u033aP k and\nT (U, P )(Pk \u033aP k ) = Uk Pk \u033aP k Uk\u2217 , so after measuring and knowing\nthe result the operator T does a switch operation, applying K (Uk )\nto the a posteriori state conditionally. However T (U, P ) may be applied\nwithout ever actually getting the result of the measurement.\nIn the special case when Uj and Pj commute for all j then P\nT (U , P ) = K(W )\u25e6T (I, P ) = T (I, P )\u25e6K(W ) where T (I, P ) = j Q (Pj ) is\na measurement of the outcome j without any definite information about itsvalue.\n\nF. Definite Message States as Registers\n1) The Destructive Read Memory Cell:\nThe cell is in the state \u03b4b where b \u2208 2 . We need to read the bit stored, b,\nand restore it by quantum operations. The cell requires the measurement of\n\u2217\nwhether there is a message or not (i.e., the observable \u03b4\u039b \u2297\u03b4\u039b\n) . The unitary\noperators necessary are the ones which append the bits and which erase them :\nV0 ,V1 ,V2 ,V3 , where Vz is the unique unitary operator which maps \u03b4x to \u03b4x*z .\nTo read the value of b we may proceed:\n1.a.1) Apply V3 to \u03b4b to get V3 (\u03b4b ), which equals \u03b4\u039b if b=1 but equals\n\u03b403 if b=0 .\n\u2217\n1.a.2) Determine if the bit was erased by measuring \u03b4\u039b \u2297\u03b4\u039b\n.

A message state \u03b4x stores a bit string\nx0 x1 ...xn\u22121 \u22082n . We can shift bits in and out on the right by the operators\nK(Va ), a\u22084. We also assume we can measure N, the message length.\nTo shift in a bit b, K(Vb )(\u03b4x \u2297\u03b4x\u2217 ) = \u03b4xb \u2297\u03b4xb \u2217 . The length is now n+1 .\nTo shift out a bit, suppose x=ab, a\u22082n\u22121 :\n2.b.1) Measure N, and record the result n.

Communication in Quantum Message Space\nThe classical Shannon model for communication over a channel is summarized\nby the familiar flow diagram:\nmessage\nsent signal\nreceived signal\nmessage\nsource \u2192 encoder/transmitter \u2192 channel \u2192 decoder/receiver \u2192 destination\nnoise\nRather than over-stretch the analogy with the classical situation, let us describe the steps involved in Alice sending a free-group string, possibly a binary\nstring, to Bob:\n10\n\n\f0) Start at the source.\nLet \u03c1 be any state in message space. The sender Alice gets the message from the source by\nmeasuring the message observable. The probability that the selected message is z equals\nh\u03b4z |\u03c1(\u03b4z )i\nTr(\u03c1) . Note that the source may be a message that Alice composed herself\nby applying the unitary operators V0 and V1 in proper order starting with \u03b4\u039b . For\nexample if z \u2208 FG(2) equals 10010 then the composed source would be the pure\nmessage state determined by the basis vector V0 \u25e6 V1 \u25e6 V0 \u25e6 V0 \u25e6 V1 (\u03b4\u039b ) =\u03b4z .\n1) Alice gets the message to send .\nAfter this action the state is h\u03b4z |\u03c1 (\u03b4z )i \u03b4z \u2297\u03b4z\u2217 and Alice has the message z to send to Bob.\nTheprababilityofgettingthismessagefromsource\u03c1is\nPr(z|\u03c1) = h\u03b4z |\u03c1 (\u03b4z )i/ Tracc(\u03c1)\n2) Alice encodes the message.\nBy applying a unitary operator G the state is transformed so that its normalized\nform is \u03c8\u2297\u03c8 \u2217 ; \u03c8 = G(\u03b4z ) need not be a message basis vector nor even be a\nmultiple qubit (i.e., \u03c8 need not be an eigenvector of N ).\n3) Alice transmits the encoded message over the channel.\nThe general channel is modelled as a trace-preserving quantum operator E mapping states on H to states. E may have an operator sum decomposition\nX\nO(j)\u03c4 O(j)\u2217\n(9)\nE(\u03c4 ) =\nj\n\nwhere the O(j) are bounded operators such that\n\nP\n\nj\n\nO (j)\u2217 O (j) = I\n\n4) The channel transforms the sent signal into the received signal.\nThe received signal is now\n\u2217\u0001\n\n\u03b1 = h\u03b4z |\u03c1 (\u03b4z )i E G (\u03b4z ) \u2297 G (\u03b4z )\n5) Bob decodes the received signal .\n\nHe does this by applying G\u22121 = G\u2217 to the received signal.

They use their\nknowledge of the channel dynamics and [statistical?] knowledge about the initial\nchannel state and the source \u03c1 to design an encoding unitary transformation\nG which maximizes (as a function of unitary G) the probability that the sent\nmessage is the received message.\nPr(received = sent|source = \u03c1) =\n\nX\n\nPr(received = sent|sent = z) Pr(z|\u03c1) =\n\nz\n\nX\nz\n\nG (\u03b4z ) E G (\u03b4z ) \u2297 G (\u03b4z )\n\n(10)\n\nIf we assume the operator sum form above then\nE\nP\nPr(z|\u03c1)\n|h\nG\n(\u03b4\n)|\nO(j)|G\n(\u03b4\n)\nPr(received=sent|source=\u03c1) =\nz\nz\nz,j\n\n2\n\nThus Alice and Bob choose G to maximize the above 4th degree form in G,\nsubject to the unitary constraint G\u2217 G = I.\n\n7) Bob passes the message along to its destination and resets the\nmessage state.\n\"Passing the message along\" is a classical process.\nBob might reset the\n\u2217\nmessage state to \u03b4\u039b \u2297\u03b4\u039b\nby applying the operator Rw\u22121 .\n\nIV. HARMONIC ANALYSIS ON FG(2)\nA standard reference for harmonic analysis on finitely generated free groups is\n[TP]. We also use [Na] for some functional analytic aspects of the argument.\nThe results of this parts are all consequences of results therein. A self-contained\ndevelopment of harmonic analysis of FG(2) which realizes the principal series\non L2 [0,1[ will be found in [TR3].\nThe group FG(2) = \u228en\u22650 FG(2)n , and so it is countably infinite.

The Regular Representation\nThe left and right regular representations L and R respectively are defined by\nLq f (x) =f q \u22121 x) , Rq f (x) =f (xq) wheref \u2208lp (FG(2))and x,q \u2208FG(2).\n(13)\nThe binary operation of convolution * is defined by\nX\nf \u22c6 g(x)=\nf (y)g(z)\n(14)\ny*z=x\n\nL and R define unitary representations of the free group on l2 which\ncommute with one another. In fact, results in [Na] imply that all operators\nwhich commute with R are weak limits of linear combinations of Lq , and\nconversely. More explicitly, a bounded operator on l2 which commutes with\nall Rq is of the form g | \u2192 h*g for some unique h \u2208 l2 (but not every such\nh defines a bounded operator on l2 ) . The only operators commuting\nwith both L and R are scalar multiples of I, so L (and R) are factor\nrepresentations of FG(2); in fact, the factor is of von Neumann type II1 .\n13\n\n\fThe main connection between QMS and harmonic analysis on FG(2) is\nthe observation that the operators Va which append and remove bits are the\noperators Ra\u22121 .\nharmonic analysis on FG(2) the operators k ( M ) =\nP In the context of\n\u2217\nk(x)\n\u03b4\n\u2297\u03b4\nare\nthe multipliers which map f to k f.

These observables permit conditional operations which are tracepreserving and which commute with all the operators Ra ; i.e., the quantum\noperations Q( p\u22c6) and K(Ra ) commute, \u2200 a\u2208 FG(2).\n\nB. Radial Functions and the Decomposition of the Left\nRegular Representation into Irreducible Representations\nThe material in this section is adapted from [TP]; a self-contained technical\nreport[TR3] is forth-coming. As shown in [Na] there is no unique way to\ndo harmonic analysis on a free group with more than one generator, but the\ntechnique in [TP] is elegant and of interest here.\nA function f on FG(2) is radial provided f ( x ) depends only on the\nmessage length # x . Let K be the vector space of all radial functions with\nfinite support. The functions (\u03bcn ) form an orthogonal basis for K, where \u03bcn (x)\n= 1/n if # x = n , and is 0 otherwise.\nThen K turns out to be a commutative algebra under convolution, and in fact\nit is generated by \u03bc1 . This follows from the formula\n3\n1\n\u03bcn\u22121 + \u03bcn+1 , n>0.\n(16)\n4\n4\nIt follows\nPn immediately by induction that for any n there is a polynomial\npn (\u03bb)= k=0 pnk \u03bbk such that \u03bcn =pn0 \u03b4\u039b + pn1 \u03bc1 + pn2 \u03bc1 \u22c6\u03bc1 +...+ pnn \u03bc\u22c6n\n1 . In\nother words, every function in K is a convolution polynomial in \u03bc1 . The\ncommutative von Neumann algebra generated by A = \u03bc1 \u22c6 as an operator\non l2 ( FG(2)) is maximal Abelian in the von Neumann algebra generated by\n( La )a\u2208FG(2) . This means it can be used to decompose the left regular representation into irreducible representations of the free group. Note that in general\nthe measurement of A will smear a definite message and scatter its length.\n\u03bc1 \u22c6 \u03bcn =\n\n14\n\n\fFormula (16) implies that the polynomials pn satisfy the recursion\npn+1 ( \u03bb) =\n\n1\n4\npn (\u03bb) \u2212 pn\u22121 (\u03bb), forn > 0; p0 (\u03bb) = 1, p1 (\u03bb) = \u03bb.\n3\n3\n\n(17)\n\nThe spectrum of \u03bc1 \u22c6 considered\nas a self-adjoint operator on l2 (FG(2))\n\u221a \u221a\n3\n3\nturns out to be the interval [- 2 , 2 ], so \u03bb in (17) may be restricted to that\ninterval.

The re-scaled polynomials En (x)=\u01ebn ( 23 x ), | x|\u22641,\nsatisfy the recursion formula En+1 ( x )=2 x En ( x ) - En\u22121 ( x ), which is the\nrecursion formula satisfied by the Chebyshev polynomials, so En is a\u221alinear\ncombination of Tn and Un ; in fact, for n\u22651 En (x)=(Tn (x)+Un (x))/ 3, so\np0 (\u03bb)=1,\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\u0013\n\u0012 \u0012\n2\n2\n1\n(19)\n\u2200n > 0 pn (\u03bb) = 3\u2212n/2 Tn \u221a \u03bb + Un \u221a \u03bb\n2\n3\n3\n1) The Poisson Boundary of FG(2)\nThe Poisson Boundary of the free group is the set \u03a9 of infinite reduced words\nfrom the alphabet 4={0,1,2,3}. In other words, \u03a9 is the subset of the infinite\nproduct 4N consisting of those infinite strings which contain none of the diagrams\n02,13,20,31 . \u03a9 is a closed subset of the compact space 4N and therefore itself\ncompact.\nThe group FG(2) acts on \u03a9 in a natural way:\nx * \u03c9 = reduce(x\u03c9) = reduce (x0 . . .xn\u22121 \u03c90 . . . \u03c9n\u22121 ) \u03c9n \u03c9n+1 . . . .\n\n(20)\n\nE.g., 01121032*012231100. . .= 01121231100. . .\nFor every x \u2208 FG(2), x 6= \u039b, let Ex = {\u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9: \u2200j if # x>j then , \u03c9j =xj }.\nThere is a unique Borel probability measure \u03bd on \u03a9 which assigns measure\n1\nto Ex . In other words the probability that an infinite reduced word\n4*3#x\u22121\nstarts with x depends only on the length of x.\nThe action of FG(2) on \u03a9 does not preserve the measure \u03bd; it transforms it\naccording to\nZ\n\n\u03a9\n\n\u03be(x * \u03c9)d\u03bd =\n\nZ\n\nP (x, \u03c9)\u03be(\u03c9)d\u03bd, for all continuous functions \u03be on \u03a9. (21)\n\n\u03a9\n\n15\n\n\fIn [TR3] an elementary measure isomorphism between (\u03a9,\u03bd) and [0,1] with\nLebesgue measure is established so in fact all the analysis may be transferred\nto the unit interval.\n\n2) The Poisson Kernel and the Principal Series\nThe Poisson Kernel is the function P in the above formula (21); it is given by\nP(x,\u03c9)=32N (x,\u03c9)\u2212#x, where N(x,\u03c9)= k iff \u03c9j =xj if k > j but \u03c9k 6=xk . This\nformula implies that the operator \u03c0z (x) on L2 (\u03a9,\u03bd) is unitary whenever\nRe(\nz )= 21 :\n\u03c01/2+it (x)(\u03be)(\u03c9) = P (x, \u03c9)1/2+it \u03be x\u22121 * \u03c9),\n\n(22)\n\n2\n\nwhere t \u2208 R and \u03be\u2208L (\u03a9,\u03bd). In fact, x \u2192\u03c01/2+it (x) defines a unitary\nrepresentation of the free group FG(2) on L2 (\u03a9,\u03bd), one of the members of the\nprincipal series of representaions \u03c0z . When z = 1/2+i t the representation is\nirreducible in that no non-trivial closed Hilbert subspace of L2 (\u03a9,\u03bd) is invariant\nunder all \u03c0z (x). Irreducibility implies that all bounded linear operators on\nL2 (\u03a9,\u03bd) are limits (in the weak operator topology) of finite linear combinations\nof \u03c01/2+it (x), and that all pure states are limits of linear combinations of\n\u03c01/2+it (x)(\u03c6), where \u03c6 is any non-zero vector (1\u03a9 say).\n3) The Fourier Transform and the Decomposition of the Left Regular\nRepresentation\nThe Fourier Transform which decomposes the left regular representation can\nnow be defined. Let\nK((\u03bb, \u03c9), x) = P (x, \u03c9)1/2+it(\u03bb) ,\nwhere\n\nx \u2208 FG (2) , \u03c9\u2208\u03a9 , \u03bb \u2208 sp(A)=[-\n\n\u221a \u221a\n3\n3\n2 , 2 ]\n\n, and t (\u03bb) =\n\n.\n.

Then F diagonalizes all the operators k ( A), where k is any bounded Borel function: F ( k (\nA)( f ))(\u03bb,\u03c9) = k (\u03bb) F ( f )(\u03bb,\u03c9),\n\u22121\nor equivalently F \u25e6k(A)\u25e6F\nk \u22971\u03a9 ). In particular A is transformed to\n\u221a =Mul(\n\u221a\nmultiplication by \u03bb on [- 3/2, 3/2] .\nThe inverse Fourier transform is given by the kernel :\nK \u22a4 ((\u03bb, \u03c9),R x)=K(x,\n(\u03bb, \u03c9))\u2217 = P (x, \u03c9)1/2\u2212it(\u03bb)\nR\n\u22121\nF (\u03a8)(x)= sp(A) \u03a9 K \u22a4 (\u03bb, \u03c9), x)\u03a8(\u03bb, \u03c9)d\u03bd(\u03c9)w(\u03bb)d\u03bb.\nThus the transform is unitary; here is the Plancherel formula:\nZ\nZ\n2\n\u2217\n|F (f )(\u03bb, \u03c9)|2 d\u03bd(\u03c9)w(\u03bb)d\u03bb\nkf k2 = f \u2217f (\u039b) =\nsp(A)\n\n\u03a9\n\nThis summary of harmonic analysis on the free group FG(2) indicates that\none class of projectors what commute with all Ra are those of the form\nf \u2192 g \u22c6 f ,where g is a radial function. The Fourier transform of such an\noperator is of the form Mul(\u011d\u22971\u03a9 ), where F ( g)= \u011d\u22971\u03a9 . The operator is a\nprojector iff \u011d 2 = \u011d, so \u011d = 1B for some Borel set B \u2286 sp(A) . If follows that\ng(x) = Gn (B)=\n\nZ Z\nB\n\n\u03a9\n\n\u0001\nP x\u22121 , \u03c9 d\u03bd(\u03c9)w(\u03bb)d\u03bb =\n\nZ\n\npn (\u03bb)w(\u03bb)d\u03bb\n\n(25)\n\nB\n\nR\nwhere n = # x, g is a radial function, and g(\u039b) = B w(\u03bb)d\u03bb. Since\ng \u22c6 \u03b4\u039b = g, for all x \u2208FG(2) |g(x)|2 /(kgk|22 ) represents the probability of\nreceiving message x after measuring the projector g\u22c6 starting in state \u03b4\u039b .\nThis\nR number is the same for all reduced words of the same length n, given by\n( B pn (\u03bb)w(\u03bb)d\u03bb )2 . Note that this probability is not an additive set function\nof B, whereas B\u2192Gn ( B ) is a signed measure.\n\nC. The Harmonic Analysis of a Single Left Translate Operator La\nLet a \u2208 FG(2), a 6= \u039b. Such a choice definF es a non-trivial action of the\nintegers Z on FG(2) : ( n, x ) \u2192 an * x . Each orbit has a unique reduced word\nz of minimum length. Therefore, if z 6= \u039b, z0 6= inv (a#a\u22121 )= inverse of last\nletter of a, and z0 6=a0 = first letter of a. Therefore the orbits are in one-toone correspondence with the set Z of all z satisfying these conditions. Thus\nthere is a unique unitary operator T :l2 (FG(2)) :\u2192L2 (T\u00d7 Z ), where T is the\nd\u03b8\n, such that T (\u03b4an *z )(\u03b1,z) =\nunit circle with normalized euclidean measure 2\u03c0\n17\n\n\f\u03b1n \u03b4z . This operator diagonalizes La ; i.e., T \u25e6La \u25e6T \u22121 = Mul(\u03b6\u22971Z ), \u03b6(\u03b1)=\u03b1,\nP\nT \u25e6La \u25e6T \u22121 ( n\u2208Z k\u0302( n) Lan ) = Mul(k\u22971Z ) for any bounded function k on\nR\n1 \u03c0\ni\u03b8 \u2212in\u03b8\nT with ordinary Fourier series k\u0302( n) = 2\u03c0\nd\u03b8, and the operator\n\u2212\u03c0 k(e )e\nP\nP\nn\u2208Z k\u0302( n) \u03b4an . The functions k\nn\u2208Z k\u0302( n) Lan is just convolution with g=\nwhich yield projectors in the weakly closed algebra generated by La and L\u2217a are\nindicator functions of Borel subsets of T.\nThe case k = 1{\u03b1:| arg(\u03b1)|<\u03c6} , \u03c0\u0017\u03c6>0, determine projectors which are easy\nto compute, since\n\ng (an ) = k\u0302(n) =\n\n1\n2\u03c0\n\n\u03c0\n\n\u0001\n1\nk ei\u03b8 e\u2212in\u03b8 d\u03b8 =\n2\u03c0\n\u2212\u03c0\n\nZ\n\nZ\n\n\u03c6\n\ne\u2212in\u03b8 d\u03b8 = sin(n\u03c6)/(n\u03c0)\n\n\u2212\u03c6\n\nif n6=0, and k\u0302(0) = \u03c6\u03c0 = kgk22 since k 2 = k in this case.\nThus La is unitarily equivalent\nP to an infinite sum of bilateral shifts . Of\ncourse La and all the operators n\u2208Z k\u0302( n) Lan commute with all the operators\nRy . Finally, since Ra = V\u25e6La \u25e6V \u2217 , where V is the unitary reflexion operator\nV(f)(x)=f(x\u22121 ), Ra is also unitarily equivalent to an infinite sum of bilateral\nshifts.\n\nV. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS\nIn this report we have developed a mathematical formulation of quantum message space and demonstrated a type of calculus for incorporating simple operations on bits into quantum communication theory and computation. How might\nquantum message space be implemented physically? Note that since a quantum\nmessage space is basically a Hilbert space with a complete orthonormal basis\nindexed by FG(2), the free group on two elements, the problem is \"merely\"\none of labelling. For example, the energy levels of a harmonic oscillator with\none degree of freedom are of the form a n + b, where n = 0,1,2,3,... . One could\nemploy any method for listing the elements of FG(2) to index the eigenstates\nof the oscillator by FG(2). Of course, in this case since the multiplicity is fixed\nthe amount of energy associated with a message grows exponentially with the\nmessage length.\nOr consider a hydrogen atom. The bound states are of the form a/n + b ,\neach with multiplicity 2 n + 1 . In principle, FG(2) could label the multitude of\nenergy stationary states. But now the energy levels pile up around 0, and the\npractical problems of distinguishing bound states when n is very large would\nmake it difficult to send long messages.\nIn their classic text, Nielsen and Chaung [NC,p.203] speculate:\n\"...it is by no means clear that the basic assumptions underlying the [finite\ndimensional] state space and starting conditions [from the computational basis]\nin the quantum circuit model are justified. Might there be anything to be gained\n\n18\n\n\fby using systems whose state space is infinite dimensional? Assuming that the\nstarting state...is a computational basis state is also not necessary...\"\nThey go on to suggest that other states, other basic unitary processors, and\nother measurements might be able to \"...perform tasks intractible within the\nquantum circuit model.\" We doubt if QMS and the operators we've studied\nextend the realm of theoretical computability, but they do show how a consistent quantum model of message sources of arbitrary length leads naturally to\nconsiderations of alternate models.\n\nAPPENDIX: Proof That The Source Entropy \u2265\nVon Neumann Entropy\nLet \u03c3 be any normalized state, and let (uk ) be an orthonormal basis of eigenP\nP\nP\n2\n\u03c3k =1 \u2200 x \u2208 FG(2), h\u03b4x |\u03c3(\u03b4x )i= k \u03c3k |ukx | ,\nvectors for \u03c3= k \u03c3k uk \u2297u\u2217k ,\nk\nP\n2\nwhere ukx =h\u03b4x |uk i.
