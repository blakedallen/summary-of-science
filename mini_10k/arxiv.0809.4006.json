Although the number and density of young\nstars in this area does not rival those found in the Orion Nebula, it is still one of the\nmost active regions of ongoing star formation within 500 pc of the Sun. It is typically\ndivided into two regions: the Orion Molecular Cloud 2/3 region, which contains a\nfilamentary molecular cloud rapidly forming new stars, and NGC 1977, a composite\nreflection and emission line nebula. In this chapter, we will review the observations\nwhich delineate the stellar, sub-stellar, protostellar and gas content in these two regions.\nWe will begin by discussing the distribution of stars, gas and dust in these two regions\nand their relationship to the Orion Nebula Cluster.\n2.The Large Scale Distribution of Stars, Gas and Dust in OMC-2/3 and NGC 1977\nThe Orion Molecular Cloud 2/3 (hereafter OMC-2/3), NGC 1977 and the Orion Nebula region are part of the Orion OB 1 complex (see Figure 1); these regions fall along the\nline-of-sight of the Orion 1c (4.6 Myr) and 1d (< 1 Myr) subgroups (Brown, de Geus, & de Zeeuw\n1994). There are 15 OB stars in the subgroup 1c and 18 OB stars in subgroup 1d\n(Goudis 1982). Warren & Hesser (1978) place the Trapezium stars of the Orion Nebula\n1\n\n\f2\n\nFigure 1. The distribution of OB stars surrounding the OMC-2/3 and NGC 1977\nregions. The greyscale image is an extinction map of the Orion A cloud generated\nfrom the 2MASS PSC (Gutermuth, private communication). The star shaped markers are the OB stars in the OB 1 association (Brown 1996); the small markers are\nthe B stars and the large markers are the O stars. These show that the OMC-2/3 and\nNGC 1977 regions are surrounded by a number of B stars, particular to the north of\nNGC 1977 and the east of OMC-2/3. These OB stars are likely members of the 1c\nsubgroup.\n\nin the Orion 1d association and the most massive star in NGC 1977 in Orion 1c. The\ndivision of stars into subgroups has been done primarily by their spatial distribution,\nyet there may be significant spatial overlap between the subgroups (see, for example,\nJeffries et al. (2006)). Thus, the membership of the two subgroups and the relationship\nof the subgroups to the current star formation in OMC-2/3 is far from clear. Surrounding OMC-2/3 and NGC 1977 are a number of B stars. Directly north of NGC 1977, and\noutside the molecular cloud, is the NGC 1981 cluster which contains four B stars. To\nthe east of OMC-2/3 are three B stars. The relationship of these stars to the OMC-2/3\nand NGC 1977 regions is not understood; it is plausible that they have influenced star\nformation in these regions by compressing, heating and/or ionizing the molecular gas\nin the Orion A cloud.\nIn Figure 2, we show the relationship of OMC-2/3 and NGC 1977 to the Orion\nNebula using the positions of known young stars and protostars and maps of the dust\n\n\f3\n\nFigure 2. OMC-2/3, NGC 1977, and the Orion Nebula Cluster. The upper left\npanel shows 8 \u03bcm emission observed with IRAC on Spitzer. The box shows the\n20\u2032 \u00d7 20\u2032 field mapped by Peterson et al. (2008). The upper right panel shows the\ndistribution of young stars and protostars identified by variability or infrared excess\n(Carpenter, Hillenbrand, & Skrutskie 2001; Megeath et al. 2008a, in prep). This map\nis incomplete toward the center of the Orion Nebula cluster. The lower left panel\nshows the distribution of velocity integrated CS 2 \u2192 1 emission mapped by Five\nCollege Radio Astronomy Observatory (N. Ridge, priv. comm.). The lower right\npanel shows a radial velocity versus declination plot of the same data cube integrated\nover RA. The two lines show the extent of the box shown in the other panels.\n\n\f4\nand gas emission. The Spitzer 8 \u03bcm map shows the emission of UV heated small\ngrains and hydrocarbons. The Orion Nebula is the region of bright 8 \u03bcm emission\nin the southern part of the map. Extended diffuse emission is detected in OMC-2/3.\nWithin this emission, dense molecular filaments are apparent in absorption against the\ndiffuse emission. This filamentary cloud of dense molecular gas is seen in the lower\nangular resolution CS (2 \u2192 1) map. Apart from a shift in the molecular gas velocity,\nas shown in the declination-velocity map, the gas in the OMC-2/3 region appears to\nbe a continuation of the same gas associated with the Orion Nebula. NGC 1977 is\nsurrounded by a loop in the 8 \u03bcm emission; the emission is brightest where the loop\nmeets the dense molecular gas.\nTwo studies have identified the pre-main sequence and protostellar sources throughout the entire region displayed in Figure 2. Carpenter, Hillenbrand, & Skrutskie (2001)\nused multi-epoch JHKS -band imaging of a 0.84\u25e6 \u00d7 6\u25e6 region centered on the Orion\nNebula to examine variability in young stars. Variable stars in this sample are likely to\nbe young pre-main sequence stars. More recently, Megeath et al. (2008a, in prep) have\nidentified infrared excess sources in the Orion A molecular cloud by combining midinfrared photometry from the Spitzer Space Telescope with the Two Micron All Sky\nSurvey (2MASS) point source catalog (Skrutskie et al. 2006); these sources are young\npre-main sequence stars and protostars with dusty disks and envelopes.\nThe observations show a continuous distribution of young stars extending from the\nOrion Nebula, where the density of young stars is highest, out to the NGC 1977 region.\nThe region of peak density is often referred to as the Orion Nebula Cluster (hereafter,\nONC, see the chapters by Muench et al. and O'Dell et al.). From the distribution of\ngas and stars, it is not clear where the ONC ends. Hillenbrand & Hartmann (1998) set\nan outer radius of the ONC of 2.06 pc, which partially incorporates OMC-2. Carpenter\n(2000) used the surface density of 2MASS sources on the sky, corrected for background\ncontamination, to map the distribution of young stars in the Orion A cloud. Using a\nsmoothed surface density plot, Carpenter (2000) identified clusters as contiguous areas\nof elevated surface density; this analysis led to the incorporation of the OMC-2/3 and\nNGC 1977 regions into a single cluster centered on the Orion Nebula, four parsecs in\nradius, with over 1700 stars. More recently, Megeath et al. (2008a, in prep; see also\nAllen et al. (2007)) used the path linkage criterion of Battinelli (1991) with a critical\nlength of 0.33 pc to map the extent of the Orion Nebula cluster; they also include\nOMC-2/3 and NGC 1977 in the ONC.\nIn summary, the OMC-2/3 and NGC 1977 regions appear to be part of a complex\nof young stars and gas extending three parsecs from the Orion Nebula. These regions\ncan be thought of as composing a continuous cluster of young stars. Observationally,\nthese three regions are best differentiated by the morphologies of their 8 \u03bcm nebulosity.\nThe Orion Nebula is characterized by bright emission due to OB stars heating the surface of the Orion A cloud; in this region, the molecular cloud appears to be behind the\nbright nebulosity. In contrast, the OMC-2/3 region shows the molecular gas in absorption against extended diffuse emission. Finally, the NGC 1977 region is surrounded\nby a loop of emission; presumably the walls of a cavity cleared in the molecular gas\nby the young B stars. The distinctive morphologies reflect the different environmental\nconditions in these three regions: the ONC region containing young stars and molecular\ngas irradiated by intense extreme UV radiation, the OMC-2/3 region containing protostars embedded in molecular filaments, and the NGC 1977 region being largely cleared\nof molecular gas and containing young stars irradiated by far-UV radiation from three\n\n\f5\nB stars. These different environmental conditions are perhaps the best motivation for\ndividing the northern end of the Orion A cloud into three distinct regions.\n3.\n\nThe Orion Molecular Cloud 2/3 Region\n\nThe OMC-2/3 region (see Figures 3 and 4) encompasses a section of the Orion A\nmolecular cloud undergoing vigorous star forming activity, and at a distance of 450\npc (Genzel & Stutzki 1989), it contains one of the richest assemblages of protostars in\nthe extended solar neighborhood. It is important to note that four recent and independent estimates of the distance to the ONC place it closer, consistent with a value of\n420 pc (Hirota et al. 2007; Jeffries 2007; Menten et al. 2007; Sandstrom et al. 2007);\nhowever, throughout this discussion we use 450 pc.\nOMC-2/3 is located in a molecular filament extending northward from the Orion\nNebula (NGC 1976) to NGC 1977. Interest in OMC-2/3 was elevated by the detection\nof a chain of 21 submillimeter condensations by Chini et al. (1997) and the detection\nof numerous knots of H2 emission from multiple outflows (Yu, Bally, & Devine 1997).\nThese observations revealed for the first time the full extent of the star formation activity\nin OMC-2/3.\nThe OMC-2 region was first defined by Gatley et al. (1974) in their discovery of a\ngroup of near-infrared sources embedded in a molecular core, centered at a position of\n\u03b1 = 05h 35m 26.8s , \u03b4 = \u221205\u25e6 10\u2032 17\u2032\u2032 (J2000). The far-infrared luminosity of OMC-2 is\nestimated to be 2 \u00d7 103 L\u2299 (Thronson et al. 1978). OMC-2 is north of OMC-1, which\nis the molecular cloud associated with the Orion Nebula. Interestingly, the discovery\nof OMC-3 is not well documented in the literature. In Morris et al. (1974), reference\nis made to a secondary maximum 11\u2032 north of OMC-2 in a map of HCN J = 1 \u2192 0\nemission that was possibly an artifact due to the large, 2\u2032 beamwidth. Two years later,\nKutner, Evans, & Tucker (1976) also appear to detect a maximum north of OMC-2 in\n2 millimeter H2 CO emission at the same beamwidth, but at a distance of 16\u2032 . The\nfirst actual reference to \"OMC-3\" occurs in Thronson et al. (1978) where far-infrared\nobservations of OMC-3 were centered approximately on \u03b1 = 05h 35m 10.3s , \u03b4 = \u221204\u25e6\n55\u2032 01\u2032\u2032 (J2000), which is almost 16\u2032 north of OMC-2. Goudis (1982) also notes that\nOMC-3 is 16\u2032 north of OMC-2; a reference is not given but presumably it is based on\nthis observation. Since that time, most of the references to OMC-3 have referred to\nthe location of the secondary maximum in the HCN map from the initial Morris et al.\n(1974) paper of 11\u2032 north of OMC-2. In particular, Chini et al. (1997) define OMC-3\nas the region between 3\u2032 and 11\u2032 north of the center of OMC-2.\nIn the remainder of this section, we will define the OMC-2/3 as the gas and associated stars within the 20\u2032 \u00d7 20\u2032 field outlined in Figure 2. This is the region mapped\nby Peterson et al. (2008) in their deep, near-infrared observation of OMC-2/3 (Figures\n3 and 4), and encompasses the protostellar and prestellar sources detected in the submillimeter surveys.\n3.1.\n\nMolecular Gas\n\nThe Bally et al. (1987) Bell Labs survey of 13 CO 1 \u2192 0 emission extensively mapped\nthe Orion A molecular cloud covering 8 deg2 ; the total mass was found to be 5\u00d7104 M\u2299 .\nThe map shows an integral shaped filament in the northern part of the Orion A cloud\nfrom NGC 1977 in the north through the Orion Nebula in the middle down to about\n20\u2032 north of NGC 1999 in the south. This filament, which includes OMC-2/3, is about\n\n\f6\n\nFigure 3. OMC-2/3. The 20\u2032 \u00d7 20\u2032 K\u2212band field mapped by Peterson et al.\n(2008) in their near-infrared study of OMC-2/3. Sources discussed in the text which\nare prominent in this image are labeled.\n\n0.5 \u00d7 13 pc long and has a total mass of 5\u00d7103 M\u2299 , or about 25% of the total mass\nof their map of the Orion A cloud. Bally et al. (1987) suggest that the filament results\nfrom the interstellar medium being compressed by a superbubble driven by the Orion\nOB association.\nDutrey et al. (1993) obtained J = 2 \u2192 1 C18 O maps of the Orion A cloud and\nfound that the filament seen in the Bally et al. (1987) map breaks up into several discrete\nfragments. From these observations, the molecular gas masses of OMC-2 and OMC-3\nare found to be 113M\u2299 and 140M\u2299 , respectively. However, a higher resolution study\nby Castets & Langer (1995) in several transitions of 13 CO, C18 O, C32 S and C34 S shows\nboth these regions to be much more complex. Castets & Langer (1995) shows a single\ndense core in OMC-2 with a mass of 22M\u2299 and a radius of 0.11 pc. In contrast, they\nfind the gas traced by C18 O and CS in OMC-3 is highly elongated with a total mass of\n55M\u2299 . The CS observations show three dense cores in OMC-3 with masses of 12, 10\nand 13M\u2299 ; since CS traces only the dense gas, it is inferred that the C18 O maps are\ndetecting a massive envelope surrounding the dense cores.\n\n\f7\n\nFigure 4. OMC-2/3. A 20\u2032 \u00d7 20\u2032 image showing 4.5 \u03bcm band emission observed\nwith the IRAC camera on board the Spitzer Space Telescope. This is the same region\nshown in Figure 3, and the annotations from Figure 3 are displayed.\n\n3.2.\n\nSubmillimeter Sources\n\nSubmillimeter observations of OMC-2/3 have been conducted at 1300 \u03bcm (Mezger, Wink, & Zylka\n1990; Chini et al. 1997; Nielbock, Chini, & M\u00fcller 2003), 850 \u03bcm, 450 \u03bcm (Johnstone & Bally\n1999), and 350 \u03bcm (Lis et al. 1998), resulting in the discovery of a wealth of pre-stellar,\nClass 0 and Class I objects. Twenty-one compact sources were detected in OMC-2/3 by\nChini et al. (1997) in their 1300 \u03bcm dust imaging of the region. Previous to Chini et al.\n(1997), the OMC-2 core was observed at 1300 \u03bcm by Mezger, Wink, & Zylka (1990)\nand their original six sources, listed as FIR 1a, 2\u22125 and 6a in Table 1, were also detected by Chini et al. (1997). In OMC-2, Chini et al. (1997) detected two additional\nsources north of FIR 1a (FIR 1b and 1c) as well as a cluster of compact sources near\nFIR 6a: FIR 6b\u22126e. Finally, Chini et al. (1997) found four more sources in OMC-2\n(MMS 7-10) and six sources in OMC-3 (MMS 1-6). Based on Lbol /Lsubmm ratios <\n200, all six condensations in OMC-3 fit the definition of Class 0 objects, and are thus\nin the earliest stages of protostellar evolution (Chini et al. 1997).\nAll 21 sources of Chini et al. (1997) were detected at 350 \u03bcm by Lis et al. (1998)\nexcept for one (MMS 10), and an additional 13 sources were discovered (CSO 1\u221233\n\n\f8\nTable 1.\n\nSubmillimeter Sources in OMC-2/3\n\nSource\n\nR.A.a\n\nDec.a\n\nNameb\n\n(J2000)\n\n(J2000)\n\n(Jy)\n\nMIR 1/2\nCSO 1\nCSO 2\nMIR 3\nCSO 4\nMMS 1\nMMS 2\n\n05 35 28.3\n05 35 29.8\n05 35 13.9\n05 35 15.8\n05 35 17.1\n05 35 18.1\n05 35 18.5\n\n\u221204 58 38\n\u221204 58 47\n\u221204 59 25\n\u221204 59 59\n\u221205 00 03\n\u221205 00 20\n\u221205 00 30\n\n15\n15\n17\n19\n26\n25\n\nMMS 3c\nMMS 4\nMMS 5\nMMS 6\nCSO 11\nMMS 7\n\n05 35 19.2\n05 35 20.5\n05 35 22.5\n05 35 23.5\n05 35 27.1\n05 35 26.5\n\n\u221205 00 51\n\u221205 00 50.0\n\u221205 01 15\n\u221205 01 31\n\u221205 03 39\n\u221205 03 57\n\n26\n27\n24\n45\n15\n19\n\n152\n354\n400\n2000\n164\n360\n\nMMS 8\nMMS 10\nMMS 9\nMIR 11\nMIR 12\nCSO 15\nFIR 1c\n\n05 35 26.7\n05 35 32.3\n05 35 26.2\n05 35 31.5\n05 35 25.8\n05 35 22.9\n05 35 23.8\n\n\u221205 05 19\n\u221205 05 42\n\u221205 05 44\n\u221205 05 47\n\u221205 05 58\n\u221205 06 41\n\u221205 07 09\n\n17\n\n268\n166\n412\n228\n146\n\nFIR 1b\nFIR 1a\nCSO 19\nCSO 21\nFIR 2\nMIR 20\nFIR 3\n\n05 35 23.7\n05 35 24.4\n05 35 25.0\n05 35 26.4\n05 35 24.4\n05 35 26.9\n05 35 27.5\n\n\u221205 07 35\n\u221205 07 53\n\u221205 08 19\n\u221205 08 26\n\u221205 08 34\n\u221205 09 24\n\u221205 09 38\n\n18\n18\n15\n14\n17\n\nFIR 4\n\n05 35 26.8 \u221205 10 03\n\nMIR 25\nMIR 26\nFIR 5\nMIR 28\nFIR 6b\nCSO 26\nCSO 27\nFIR 6a\nMIR 30\nFIR 6c\nFIR 6d\nMIR 36\nCSO 31\nCSO 32\nMIR 39/40\nMIR 41\nCSO 33\nMIR 43/44\n\n05 35 27.6\n05 35 28.2\n05 35 26.4\n05 35 24.8\n05 35 23.3\n05 35 26.3\n05 35 24.7\n05 35 23.4\n05 35 18.2\n05 35 21.6\n05 35 19.8\n05 35 22.6\n05 35 21.5\n05 35 21.3\n05 35 19.9\n05 35 23.5\n05 35 19.5\n05 35 25.3\n\na\n\n\u221205 10 09\n\u221205 10 14\n\u221205 10 24\n\u221205 10 30\n\u221205 12 09\n\u221205 12 23\n\u221205 12 33\n\u221205 12 42\n\u221205 13 07\n\u221205 13 14\n\u221205 13 19\n\u221205 14 11\n\u221205 14 30\n\u221205 14 54\n\u221205 15 09\n\u221205 15 23\n\u221205 15 35\n\u221205 15 36\n\nS (350 \u03bcm) S (1300 \u03bcm) S (3.6 cm) Other\n(mJy)\n\n(mJy)\n\nDesignationsb\n\n290\n\n21\n14\n18\n\n179\n347\n249\n\nCSO 3\n0.25\n\n0.15\n0.59\n\n0.79\n\nCSO 14, VLA 5\n\n0.31\n\nCSO 16; MIR 14;\nIRAS 05329-0508\nCSO 17\nCSO 18; VLA 8d\n\n180\n195\n393\n\n36\n\n340\n351\n676\n\n2.48\n\n67\n\n1252\n\n0.64\n\n34\n\n216\n423\n452\n186\n300\n\n15\n14\n19\n21\n18\n12\n15\n15\n20\n\n361\n186\n450\n314\n184\n189\n161\n140\n42\n288\n48\n\nCSO 5\nCSO 6; VLA 1;\nMIR 5/6\nCSO 7\nCSO 8; MIR 7\nCSO 9\nCSO 10; VLA 3\nMIR 9\nCSO 12; VLA 4; MIR 10;\nIRAS 05329-0505\nCSO 13\n\nCSO 20; MIR 19\n\n1.04\n\nCSO 22; VLA 11;\nMIR 21/22\nCSO 23; VLA 12; MIR 24?;\nIRAS 05329-0512\nCSO 24; MIR 27?\nVLA 13\nCSO 25; MIR 29\nCSO 28\nCSO 29\nCSO 30; MIR 31/32\nMIR 37\nMIR 38\nMIR 42\n\nPositions from Lis et al.

The central part of the OMC-2/3 region shown in Figure 3. The left\npanel shows the Spitzer 8 \u03bcm map. The right panel shows the 850 \u03bcm map of\nJohnstone & Bally (1999) in inverse greyscale. Overlaid on this map are the following: 1.) positions of the 34 submillimeter sources given in Table 1 (diamonds), 2.)\npositions of Spitzer identified protostellar candidates (asterisks) and 3.) positions\nof pre-main sequence stars (circles; see Section 3.4.). Note that many of the filaments seen in emission in the 850 \u03bcm map are seen in absorption against the diffuse\nbackground in the 8 \u03bcm map.\n\nin Table 1). In Figure 5, these 34 submillimeter sources are shown with the 8 \u03bcm\nIRAC map as well as the 850 \u03bcm map from Johnstone & Bally (1999). Overall, the\nsubmillimeter sources follow the filamentary structure of the 850 \u03bcm emission.\nNielbock, Chini, & M\u00fcller (2003) also obtained 1300 \u03bcm maps of OMC-2/3 and\nidentified 12 new 1300 \u03bcm peaks in addition to the ones already identified; all are\n\n\f10\nlisted in Table 1 (MIR sources). They complemented the submillimeter data with midinfrared imaging and detected at least 13 (and as many as 15) of the submillimeter\npeaks at 11.9 \u03bcm (N \u2212band) and 17.8 \u03bcm (Q\u2212band). In the mid-infrared, 6 of the\nsubmillimeter peaks are resolved into double sources, e.g. MMS 2 from Chini et al.\n(1997) is resolved into MIR 5 and 6 (Nielbock, Chini, & M\u00fcller 2003). The projected\nspatial separation of these two particular sources is 1.3\u2032\u2032 , or 570 AU at 450 pc, with a\nposition angle of 45\u25e6 .\nTwo of the submillimeter sources of Chini et al. (1997) coincide with Infrared Astronomical Satellite (IRAS) sources: IRAS 05329\u22120505 (MMS 7) and IRAS 05329\u2212\n0512 (FIR 4). There are also two submillimeter sources detected in X-rays: MMS 2\nand 3 (Tsuboi et al. 2001).\nSeven of the Chini et al. (1997) sources were also detected at 3.6 cm (Reipurth, Rodr\u0131\u0301guez, & Chini\n1999). They present radio continuum maps and detect a total of 14 sources at 3.6 cm,\nwhere 3 are likely background sources. The remaining 11 are likely either young stars\nor protostars. Of those 11 sources, 7 are also detected at 1300 \u03bcm and are listed in Table\n1 (VLA 1, 3, 4, 5, 8, 11, 12). These centimeter sources are thought to result from ionized\ngas in outflows, and they are clear evidence that many of the submillimeter sources are\nindeed protostars containing hydrostatic cores (Reipurth, Rodr\u0131\u0301guez, & Chini 1999).\nSubmillimeter wavelength polarimetry of OMC-3 has shown that the magnetic\nfield is perpendicular to the filament along most of the length of the region encompassed\nby the MMS 1-9 cores (Matthews & Wilson 2000). They also find that the outflows in\nthis region are not consistently aligned with the ambient field or the filament.\n3.3.\n\nOutflows\n\nInfrared, optical and millimeter measurements have shown that OMC-2/3 is rich with\noutflows driven by the young stars in this region. Yu, Bally, & Devine (1997, hereafter,\nYBD97) discovered 80 knots from 2.12 \u03bcm imaging of the v = 1 \u2212 0 S(1) line of shock\nexcited H2 with nearly a dozen of those being collimated outflows from young stellar\nobjects (YSOs) in OMC-2/3. Observations in 12 CO J = 2 \u2192 1 by Yu et al. (2000) suggest that these H2 knots are driving molecular outflows. OMC-2/3 was also observed\nat 2.12 \u03bcm by Stanke, McCaughrean, & Zinnecker (2002, hereafter SMZ02) and they\nidentified 24 flows labeled SMZ 2\u221225. Tables 2 and 3 in SMZ02 enumerate the flows\n(Table 3) and each of the H2 knots associated with those flows (Table 2); Table 2 also\nincludes a comprehensive correlation of the HH objects and YBD97 H2 knots with the\nSMZ02 H2 features. Using these positions, Williams, Plambeck, & Heyer (2003) identified nine outflows in CO emission from high resolution Berkeley-Illinois-Maryland\nArray (BIMA) imaging. Figure 7, from Williams, Plambeck, & Heyer (2003), shows\nthe location of those nine outflows, each of which appears to originate from a Chini et al.\n(1997) submillimeter source. The nine outflows line up with approximately 50 of the\n60 YBD97 H2 knots that are coincident with the BIMA map; those that do not are likely\nto be outflows in the plane of the sky (Williams, Plambeck, & Heyer 2003). Aso et al.\n(2000) identified 4 additional molecular outflows from CO (1 \u2212 0) and HCO+ (1 \u2212 0)\nobservations with the Nobeyama 45-m telescope, and all are associated with the known\nfar-infrared or millimeter sources (Chini et al. 1997; Lis et al. 1998).\nThe most prominent Herbig Haro objects in OMC-2/3 are associated with the bipolar reflection nebula known as Haro 5a/6a, first noted by Haro (1953). Haro 5a/6a\nappears almost edge-on (see Figures 3, 4, & 6), exhibiting a dark lane between the\ntwo lobes of the nebula at optical and near-infrared wavelengths (YBD97; SMZ02). A\n\n\f11\n\nFigure 6. Near-infrared J-K-H2 color-composite image of the OMC-2/3 region.\nJets and outflows appear in red. The flow associated with Haro 5a/6a is SMZ 6. Data\nobtained with the wide-field imager, WFCAM, on UKIRT. Figure courtesy of Chris\nDavis (private communication).\n\nslightly tilted obscuring torus is inferred from imaging polarimetry data (Wolstencroft et al.\n1986), while near-infrared spectroscopy suggests that the source hidden by the torus\nmay be an FU Orionis type variable (Reipurth & Aspin 1997; Greene et al. 2008).\nHaro 5a/6a is centered on IRAS source 05329-0505, which is one of the 1300\n\u03bcm sources (MMS 7) detected by Chini et al. (1997). It is also associated with a radio\njet (Reipurth et al. 2004) and a large-scale bipolar outflow (Yu, Bally, & Devine 1997;\nWilliams, Plambeck, & Heyer 2003). The western lobe of the nebula (Haro 5a) includes\na knot of H2 emission coinciding with HH 294 (see our Table 2 for a list of the prominent outflows in OMC-2/3), a well collimated optical jet 100\u2032\u2032 in length which flows\nfrom the IRAS source (Reipurth, Bally, & Devine 1997). The flow axis intercepts more\ndistant HH knots 42, 128, and 295 (Ogura & Walsh 1991; Reipurth, Bally, & Devine\n\n\f12\n\nFigure 7. This figure from Williams, Plambeck, & Heyer (2003) shows line-wing\nemission from their BIMA mosaic (interferometer data only). The blue and red\ncontours show emission integrated from v = 5.5 to 9.0 km s\u22121 and 12.5 to 16.0\nkm s\u22121 , respectively. The contour starting levels and increments are the same (8,\n4 K km s\u22121 ) for both velocity ranges. The star symbols represent the positions of\nthe Chini et al. (1997) submillimeter sources and dots represent the H2 knots from\nYu, Bally, & Devine (1997). The solid contour around the map is the 30% sensitivity\nlevel and the 8.8\u2032\u2032 \u00d7 13.4\u2032\u2032 beam is shown in the lower right-hand corner.\n\n1997), although the complex web of flows in this region makes concrete associations\ndifficult \u2013 particularly at infrared and millimeter wavelengths (Schwartz, Burton & Herrmann\n1997; Yu, Bally, & Devine 1997; Yu et al. 2000; Stanke, McCaughrean, & Zinnecker\n2002; Williams, Plambeck, & Heyer 2003; Davis et al. 2008, in prep; see also Figures 6\n& 7). Large, though faint, H2 bow shocks are detected by SMZ02, which they associate\nwith flow SMZ 6 originating from Haro 5a/6a (also called flow \"F\" in YBD97). This\nsource has also been detected in 3\u221224 \u03bcm Spitzer observations and is classified as a\nprotostar on the basis of the Spitzer photometry (see Section 3.4.).\n\n\f13\nAbout 3\u2032 north of Haro 5a/6a, a compact chain of optical/infrared knots trace\nHH 293 (flow SMZ 5 in SMZ02; flow \"C\" in YBD97). Bright H2 bows delineate\na third flow \u223c2\u2032 to the south of Haro 5a/6a (flow SMZ 9 in SMZ02; flow \"H\" in\nYBD97; labeled in Figure 6). A fourth H2 flow (flow SMZ 3 in SMZ02; flow \"B\"\nin YBD97) is detected a further arcminute north-west of HH 293. Notably, all four\nflows are more-or-less parallel, and orthogonal to the chain of cores that runs roughly\nnorth-south through the center of the region. Further south toward FIR 4 and the region\ndirectly west of M 43, a complex of star forming cores produces at least another halfdozen H2 flows (Yu et al. 2000; Stanke, McCaughrean, & Zinnecker 2002; Davis et al.\n2008), although these are more randomly oriented. Chini et al. (1997), Yu et al. (2000)\nand Williams, Plambeck, & Heyer (2003) present molecular line maps of the outflows\nin this region. The extremities of many of the flows in this region, where they break out\nof the north-south molecular filament that pervades OMC-2/3, are manifest as opticallyvisible HH objects (Ogura & Walsh 1991; Reipurth, Bally, & Devine 1997).\nTable 2.\n\nProminent Herbig-Haro and H2 outflows in OMC-2/3\n\nHH or H2 Driving\ndesignationa sourceb\nHH 294\nHH 293\nSMZ 9\nSMZ 3\na\n\nIRAS05329-0505;\nMMS 7\nMMS 5\nMMS 9\nIRS 1\n\nRAc\n(2000)\n\nDecc\n(2000)\n\n05 35 26.4 \u221205 03 54\n\nOther flow\ndesignations\n\nHaro 5a/6a;\nSMZ 6; YBD \"F\"\n05 35 22.4 \u221205 01 16 SMZ 5; YBD \"C\"\n05 35 26.2 \u221205 05 46\nYBD \"H\"\n05 35 18.2 \u221205 00 33\nYBD \"B\"\n\nLength\n(pc)d\n\nRefse\n\n1.43\n\n1,2,3,4\n\n0.05\n0.34\n0.70\n\n1,3,4\n3,4\n3,4\n\nSMZ refers to the H2 flow nomenclature of Stanke, McCaughrean, & Zinnecker (2002).\n\nb\n\nMMS designations from Chini et al.

(1974) presented a 2.2 \u03bcm map of OMC2 showing five bright sources surrounded by nebulosity, four without optical counterparts. Observations from 1.6 to 20 \u03bcm showed that these sources had rising spectral\nenergy distributions. Rayner et al. (1989) published the first infrared array observations of OMC-2 at 1\u22123 \u03bcm, including polarimetry which showed that the four infrared\nsources were the source of the reflection nebulosity associated with the sources. Infrared photometry by Johnson et al. (1990) found luminosities of 20 to 1000 L\u2299 for\nthese sources.\nThe first wide-field infrared map of OMC-2/3 was a 15\u2032 \u00d7 5\u2032 JHK mosaic by\nJones et al. (1994) which showed OMC-2 as a small group of red sources surrounded\nby an extended and relatively uniform distribution of stars. They argued that the majority of the 219 sources were associated with the Orion cloud, and were not background\nstars; this is the first evidence of a large population of stars associated with OMC-2.\n\n\f14\n\nFigure 8. The pre-main sequence star population in OMC-2/3 overlaid on the CS\n2 \u2192 1 emission (N. Ridge, priv. comm.). The sources represented by dots are those\nwith infrared excess, asterisks are the infrared-selected protostars, open circles are\nthe Carpenter, Hillenbrand, & Skrutskie (2001) variables, and squares are infrared\nsources with X-ray emission detected by Chandra (Tsujimoto et al. 2002).\n\nAli & DePoy (1995) mapped OMC-2 as part of a 2.2 \u03bcm survey of the Orion A molecular cloud. Their surface density maps showed OMC-2 as a distinct density peak about\n15\u2032 north of the center of the ONC; within this density peak they found \u223c 30 sources.\nThey also noted the presence of a large distributed population surrounding the ONC\nand OMC-2 regions containing around \u223c 1500 members. Nielbock, Chini, & M\u00fcller\n(2003) combined mid-infrared imaging with the 2MASS point source catalog and found\n57 sources with infrared excess in the OMC-2 and OMC-3 regions. Using the 2MASS\npoint source catalog, they identified 260 possible young stars in the OMC-2 and OMC-3\nregions, and found that the absolute J-band magnitude distribution of sources in OMC2 peaked at a higher luminosity than that for OMC-3. It is not clear if this difference\nis due to a different distribution of stellar masses or different age distributions; hopefully, future spectroscopic observations can be used to search for variations in the mass\nspectrum.\nRecent infrared and X-ray observations of the OMC-2/3 region motivate a reexamination of its population of pre-main sequence stars and protostars. These include\nthe 2MASS survey of Orion, multi-epoch near-infrared imaging by Carpenter, Hillenbrand, & Skrutskie\n(2001), a 100 kilosecond Chandra integration by Tsujimoto et al. (2002), and finally,\na wide field Spitzer survey of the Orion molecular clouds (Megeath et al. 2008a, in\n\n\f15\n\nFigure 9. Color-color diagrams of YSOs in OMC-2/3 and NGC 1977 drawn from\n2MASS and Spitzer photometry (Megeath et al. 2008a, in prep). The YSOs are identified either by infrared excesses, variability, or, in the case of OMC-2/3, X-ray emission. In the upper left diagram, we show the region of the 3.6\u22124.5 versus 5.8\u22128.0\ncolor-color diagram populated by young stars with disks and protostars (Allen et al.\n2004; Megeath et al. 2004; Winston et al. 2007). For sources not detected at 5.8 and\n8.0 \u03bcm, sources with infrared excesses due to disks and/or envelopes were identified\nby combining 4.5 \u03bcm photometry with near-infrared 2MASS J, H, KS photometry (Gutermuth et al. 2004; Winston et al. 2007). As shown in the upper right and\nbottom left diagrams, the infrared excess sources can be separated from reddened\nphotospheres using the reddening vector from Flaherty et al. (2007). Additional transitional disk sources were identified using the 8.0\u221224 color (Muzerolle et al. 2004;\nWinston et al. 2007; Megeath et al. 2008a, in prep, with modified criteria); these are\ngrouped with the stars with disks in our classification scheme. The bottom right\nshows the 3.6\u22124.5 versus 4.5\u221224 color-color diagram used to find likely protostars\nby identifying sources with mid-infrared colors consistent with a flat or rising spectral energy distribution (Megeath et al. 2008b, in prep).\n\n\f16\nprep). Using catalogs derived from these observations, we select young stellar objects\nas sources satisfying one of the following criteria: 1) presence of a mid-infrared excess\nfrom a dusty disk or envelope (Allen et al. 2004; Megeath et al. 2004; Gutermuth et al.\n2004; Winston et al. 2007; Whitney et al. 2004; Megeath et al. 2008a,b, in prep; Figure\n9), 2) variability in the near-infrared (Carpenter, Hillenbrand, & Skrutskie 2001), or 3)\nX-ray emission from an infrared source detected by Spitzer and/or 2MASS. We note\nthat deep near-infrared imaging by Tsujimoto et al. (2003) detected 74 X-ray sources\nwhich were not detected by 2MASS; we have not merged our data with their source\nlist.\nUsing these criteria, we have identified 347 candidate member pre-main sequence\nstars and protostars. Table 3 shows photometry for the young stellar object candidates\nthat are detected at 24 \u03bcm. The X-ray sources are taken from a reprocessing of the\nChandra data of Tsujimoto et al. (2002) for the ANCHORS database (An Archive of\nChandra Observations of Regions of Star Formation, S. Wolk P. I.). In Figure 8, we\nshow the distribution of these sources over the 20\u2032 \u00d7 20\u2032 field. These sources were also\nshown in Figure 5. In Figure 9, we show color-color diagrams of the sources. Out\nof 347 sources total, we identify 208 infrared excess sources. Of these, 43 sources\nwith 24 \u03bcm detections are classified as protostars (Class 0/I). The remaining 165 are\npredominantly stars with disks (Class II), although there may also be some protostars\nwithout 24 \u03bcm detections among these stars. In addition, 123 sources exhibit variability\nin the near-infrared, and 197 have X-ray detections. A total of 139 sources exhibiting\nvariability or X-ray emission do not have infrared excesses and thus appear to be pure\nphotospheres in the infrared (Class III). These observations demonstrate the presence of\na large number of pre-main sequence stars in the OMC-2/3 region. Future spectroscopic\nobservations are needed to determine the ages and masses of these stars and determine\nthe star forming history and initial mass function of the OMC-2/3 region.\n3.5.\n\nYoung Brown Dwarfs in OMC-2/3\n\nIn addition to a large population of pre-main sequence stars and protostars, a number\nof young brown dwarfs have been discovered in OMC-2/3. Table 4 lists the 19 spectroscopically confirmed young brown dwarfs from Peterson et al. (2008) along with their\nI\u2212 and z \u2032 \u2212band magnitudes, deep near-infrared JHK\u2212band magnitudes, and spectral types. The spectral types of these young brown dwarfs range from M6.5 to M9,\nwhich corresponds to approximate masses of 0.075\u22120.015 M\u2299 using the evolutionary\nmodels of Baraffe et al. (1998). At least one of these young brown dwarfs (source 21\nin Table 4) has strong H\u03b1 emission, indicating that it is actively accreting.\nYoung brown dwarfs, with ages much less than 10 Myr, are much more luminous and thus easier to detect than field brown dwarfs (typically older than 1 Gyr).\nHowever, the near-infrared colors of young brown dwarfs are similar to those of very\nlow mass stars, making it very difficult to identify brown dwarfs from near-infrared\nphotometry alone. Therefore, techniques for identifying brown dwarfs in star forming\nregions (Luhman 1999; Muench et al. 2001) were applied by Peterson et al. (2008) to\nselect brown dwarf candidates in OMC-2/3 from near-infrared and visible wavelength\nphotometry. Once candidate brown dwarfs were selected, far-red (0.6\u22121.0 \u03bcm) and\nnear-infrared (0.8\u22122.5 \u03bcm) spectroscopy was obtained and used to confirm the candidates as bona fide brown dwarfs.\nFigure 10 is a K versus H\u2212K color-magnitude diagram of all sources in OMC-2/3\nfrom Peterson et al. (2008). Assuming an age of 1 Myr, Baraffe et al. (1998) isochrones\n\n\f17\nwere used to select sources below the hydrogen burning limit as candidate brown\ndwarfs. For sources that were not as deeply embedded and detected in the I\u2212 and\nz \u2032 \u2212bands, near-infrared plus visible wavelength photometry was used for selection.\nThe sources confirmed by spectroscopy as brown dwarfs or low-mass stellar members\nare shown in Figure 10. Note that we have observed all brown dwarf candidates that\nfall below 0.080 M\u2299 and above 0.050 M\u2299 (for 1 Myr objects) with an extinction limit\nof 4.5 < AV < 14, making a complete sample within this regime. Figure 10 illustrates how spectroscopy is needed to confirm the mass of the object, with both young\n(< 1 Myr) brown dwarfs found above the reddening vector for 1 Myr old 0.08 M\u2299 and\nolder low-mass stellar members found below the vector. Interpretations for this apparent dispersion in near-infrared luminosities are discussed in Peterson et al. (2008).\n12\n\nOptically Confirmed BDs\nNIR Confirmed BDs\nM4-M6 Low Mass Members\nObserved (indeterminate type)\n\n13\n\nK\n\n0.080 MO\n\n14\nAV = 10\n\n15\nAV = 20\n\n0.025 MO\n\n16\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\nH-K\nFigure 10.

NGC 1973 and NGC 1975 are smaller nebulae, but often the designation NGC 1977 is used for the whole region. The field is approximately 30 \u00d7 45\narcmin, with north up and east left. Image courtesy Martin Pugh.\n\nThe NGC 1977 nebula north of the Orion Nebula was discovered by William\nHerschel in 1786, while the two smaller regions NGC 1973 and 1975 were noted by\nHeinrich Louis d'Arrest in 1862 and 1864, respectively, see Figure 11. The designation NGC 1977 is often used for the whole complex. NGC 1977 comprises the\nsouthern portion of the H II region S279, at the northern end of the Orion molecular cloud, defining an interface between the H II region and dense molecular cloud\n(Kutner, Evans, & Tucker 1976). The ionizing source for the H II region is the B1 V\nstar HD 37018 (42 Ori) (Sharpless 1959; Johnson et al. 1977). In Figures 11 and 12,\nHD 37018 appears as the brightest star near the middle of the image. There are two B3\nV stars that flank the east (HD 37058) and south-west (HD 294264) sides of HD 37018;\nthe other star to the east of HD 37018, which appears almost as bright, is HD 37077\n(45 Ori), a F0 III star. The star of approximately equal brightness to the north-west is\nHD 36958 (KX Ori), yet another B3 V star, which illuminates NGC 1973. Further to\nthe northeast is HD 294262, an A0 double star (the companion is LZ Ori, also an A0\nstar), which illuminates NGC 1975.\nJust south of the B3 V star HD 37058 is HH 45, the most prominent HH object\nin NGC 1977. It was first discovered by Schwartz (1977), and is discussed in detail in\n\n\f24\n\nFigure 12. NGC 1977 as seen at the Spitzer 4.5 and 24 \u03bcm wavelengths\n(Megeath et al. 2008a, in prep). The bright star in the center is the B1V star HD\n37018. Bright nebulosity is seen surrounding the star, particularly at 24 \u03bcm, as well\nas south of this star at the edge of the molecular filament. Within this filament,\nprotostars in the OMC-3 region can be found (see Figure 13).\n\n\f25\nReipurth (1989). The object has a bow-shock shape: the eastern side of the bow-shock\nhas a well defined boundary while the western side is more extended. The bow-shock\nhas several bright knots, and an additional knot is visible to the south of the bow-shock;\nthese are shown in Figure 9b of Reipurth (1989). The source for HH 45 is not known.\nTo the south-west of HH 45, Stanke, McCaughrean, & Zinnecker (2002) detected two\nknots of 2.12 \u03bcm H2 emission on either side of a near-infrared source; they refer to this\nsource as SMZ 1.\n\nFigure 13. NGC 1977 as seen with Spitzer at 8 \u03bcm (Megeath et al. 2008a, in\nprep). The bright star in the center is the B1V star HD 37018. The positions of young stars and protostars are plotted: the triangles are variables from\nCarpenter, Hillenbrand, & Skrutskie (2001), and the circles are infrared excess\nsources from Megeath et al. (2008a, in prep). A total of 170 young stellar objects\nare found with either infrared excess or variability.\n\nThe Spitzer observations show that the H II region fills a loop of 8 \u03bcm emission\n(Figure 13). This suggests that NGC 1977 is part of a larger cavity excavated in the\nmolecular gas by the B stars and that the H II region is gas ionized off the cavity by the\nB stars. The 8 \u03bcm emission is brightest toward NGC 1977, where the loop intersects the\nfilament of dense molecular gas and the OMC-2/3 region. Makinen et al. (1985) find\nthat this region is externally heated by HD 37018, and the radio continuum observations\npresented in their paper rule out the possibility of additional heating by any embedded\nstars earlier than B2.5-B3. Detailed observations of the interface between NGC 1977\n\n\f26\nand the molecular cloud to the south by Kutner et al. (1985) show that the density of\nthe molecular cloud drops off gradually toward the interface.\nThe distribution of young stars in Figure 13 shows a concentration of stars within\nthe loop. These are presumably the young, low mass stars associated with the B stars.\nThe Spitzer observations show 146 stars within NGC 1977 with infrared excesses, as selected by the color-color diagrams in Figure 9. Of the 146 stars with infrared excesses,\nsix appear to be protostars (Class 0/I) based on their 3.6\u22124.5 and 4.5\u221224 \u03bcm colors\n(Megeath et al. 2008a, in prep). The remaining 140 infrared excess sources are primarily young stars with disks (Class II), although some protostars that were not detected at\n24 \u03bcm may be among the 140 sources. In addition, Carpenter, Hillenbrand, & Skrutskie\n(2001) identified 97 variables in the same region; 24 of the variables do not have infrared excesses (Class III). In total, there are 170 young stellar objects in NGC 1977\nidentified by the presence of an infrared excess or variability (note that there is no\nChandra data toward NGC 1977 so X-rays were not used for pre-main sequence star\nselection). The positional limits used for this analysis are \u03b1 = 05h 34m 30s to 05h 36m\n15s , \u03b4 = \u221204\u25e6 57\u2032 00\u2032\u2032 to \u221204\u25e6 37\u2032 30\u2032\u2032 (J2000). The photometry for the young stellar\nobjects in NGC 1977 with Spitzer 24 \u03bcm detections is presented in Table 5.\n5.\n\nSummary\n\nThe northern end of the Orion A molecular cloud is the most active region of low and\nhigh mass star formation within 500 pc of our Sun and is one of the most intensively\nstudied star forming regions in the sky. However, most of these observations exclusively\ntarget the Orion Nebula and the region immediately surrounding the nebula. This chapter reviews the rich concentration of pre-main sequence stars and protostars north of\nthe Orion Nebula in OMC-2/3 and NGC 1977. These regions provide examples of star\nformation in environments much different than that in the Orion Nebula; in particular, in environments without the extreme-UV radiation found in the Orion Nebula, and\nshowing lower stellar densities than the densities found in the center of the Orion Nebula. Future studies of the ONC should encompass OMC-2/3 and NGC 1977 in order\nto fully characterize the wide variety of environments within this single contiguous star\nforming region and how these environments affect star and planet formation.\nAcknowledgments.
