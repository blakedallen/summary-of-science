In this approach basic variables describing gauge fields are\n1\n\n\fnot the gauge field vector \u00c2\u03bc or the curvature tensor F\u0302\u03bc\u03bd , but rather parallel transport operators (non-Abelian phase factors) associated with loops\nin physical space [2, 3, 4] or their traces (Wilson loops). This formalism allows one to consider the dynamics of Yang-Mills fields as dynamics of chiral\nfields on loop space and is particularly useful in investigating the relation\nbetween gauge theories and string theories [1, 4]. Asymptotic behavior of\nloop variables at large distances is known to be closely connected with the\nconfining properties of the theory [5, 6, 7, 8]. In the conventional picture of\nconfinement colour charges are connected by QCD string, which corresponds\nto the well-known Wilson area law for the Wilson loop [5].\nOn the other hand Wilson loops are directly measured in various lattice simulations. Besides Wilson area law, results of simulations of fourdimensional pure Yang-Mills theory [9, 10] confirmed the Casimir scaling\nphenomenon, predicted by many models of nonperturbative QCD vacuum\n[6, 7, 8, 11].\nThese most general results of lattice simulations can be used to reveal\nsome aspects of loop dynamics. In this paper we investigate the probability distribution of parallel transporters on the group manifold and the\ncorresponding amplitude, which is the quantum counterpart of classical loop\nvariables. It is shown that when the Wilson area law [5] and Casimir scaling\n[7, 8] hold for quantum gauge field, this amplitude can be obtained as the\nsolution of the free Schr\u00f6dinger equation on the group manifold. Solutions\nof this equation are then expressed in terms of path integral. A nontrivial\nconclusion is that two-dimensional pure Yang-Mills theory living on the surface spanned on the loop also solves this equation. This fact may provide\nsome hints on the correct string theory which solves quantum loop equations\n[1, 2]. It is also in agreement with the dimensional reduction scenario in lattice gauge theory [12]. We also discuss possible modification of the obtained\nequation when Casimir scaling is violated.\n\n2\n\nDistribution of parallel transporters on the\ngroup manifold\n\nWe consider gauge fields \u00c2\u03bc (x) belonging to the Lie algebra of some simple\ncompact group G. To any smooth closed path \u03b3 we can attribute parallel\n\n2\n\n\ftransport operator defined as the path-ordered exponent:\n\uf8eb\n\n\u00db (\u03b3) = P exp \uf8edi\n\nZ\n\u03b3\n\n\uf8f6\n\ndx\u03bc \u00c2\u03bc \uf8f8\n\n(1)\n\nParallel transport operator is the element of some representation of the group\nG, therefore to each path \u03b3 corresponds some group element g(\u03b3). For the\nsake of simplicity here we will consider only topologically trivial loops, without intersections or twists. In order to evaluate the path-ordered exponent\nin (1) one should introduce some initial point x0 on the loop \u03b3. Parallel\ntransport operator transforms under gauge transformations and shifts of the\ninitial point x0 \u2192 x\u20320 in the following way:\n\u00db (\u03b3) \u2192 T\u0302 (x0 )\u00db (\u03b3) T\u0302 \u2020 (x0 )\n\u00db (\u03b3) \u2192 P exp i\n\n\u2032\nx\nR0\n\n\u03b3;x0\n\n\uf8eb\n\n!\n\ndx\u03bc \u00c2\u03bc \u00db (\u03b3) P exp \uf8edi\n\nx\nR0\n\n\u03b3;x\u20320\n\n\uf8f6\n\ndx\u03bc \u00c2\u03bc \uf8f8\n\n(2)\n\nIn quantum theory one can not establish any deterministic correspondence between loops in physical space and the elements of the gauge group\nG, but one can calculate the amplitude which will determine the probability\ndP (g) for the group element g(\u03b3) to be within an infinitesimal volume d\u03bc(g)\non the group manifold. We introduce this amplitude \u03c8(g; \u03b3) in the following\nway:\n\u03c8(g; \u03b3) = h \u03b4 (g, g(\u03b3)) i\n(3)\nwhere by h . . . i we denote vacuum expectation value (we work in pure euclidean Yang-Mills theory without quarks) and \u03b4 (f, g) is the delta-function\non the group manifold defined by the following relation:\nZ\n\nd\u03bc(g)\u03c6(g)\u03b4 (g, f ) = \u03c6(f )\n\n(4)\n\nG\n\nfor an arbitrary function \u03c6(g) on the group\nmanifold. Here d\u03bc(g) is the Haar\nR\nmeasure on the group G normalized as d\u03bc(g) = 1. The probability dP (g)\nG\n\nis then obtained as:\n\ndP (g) = |\u03c8(g; \u03b3)|2 d\u03bc(g)\n\n(5)\n\nGauge invariance of the theory implies that the amplitude \u03c8(g; \u03b3) should\nbe also invariant under gauge transformations and in addition it should not\n3\n\n\fdepend on the choice of the initial point x0 on the loop. It follows then\nfrom the transformation laws (2) and from the fact that d\u03bc(g) = d\u03bc(f \u22121 g f )\nfor any group element f that the amplitude \u03c8(g; \u03b3) should actually be the\nfunction on the group classes [13, 14], that is:\n\u03c8(g; \u03b3) = \u03c8(f \u22121 g f ; \u03b3)\n\n(6)\n\nfor any element f of the gauge group G.\nIt is known from the theory of harmonic analysis on compact groups that\nthe characters of irreducible unitary representations of simple compact group\nbuild full orthonormal basis in the Hilbert space of functions on the group\nclasses [13, 14], therefore the function \u03c8(g; \u03b3) can be decomposed as:\n\u03c8(g; \u03b3) =\n\nX\n\n\u03c7\u0304k (g)\u03c8k (\u03b3)\n\n(7)\n\nk\n\nwhere the subscript k labels irreducible unitary representations of the group\nG, including the trivial one, \u03c7k (g) = Tr T\u0302 (k) (g) are the group characters\nand T\u0302 (k) (g) is the matrix in the k-th representation which corresponds to the\nR\nelement g. Using the orthogonality of group characters d\u03bc(g)\u03c7k (g)\u03c7\u0304l (g) =\nG\n\n\u03b4kl one obtains for the decomposition coefficients \u03c8k (\u03b3) in (7):\nR\n\n\u03c8k (\u03b3) = d\u03bc(g)\u03c7k (g)\u03c8(g; \u03b3) =\n\nd\u03bc(g)\u03c7k (g)h \u03b4 (g, g(\u03b3)) i =\n\nG\n\nG\n\nR\n\nR\n\n(8)\n\n= h d\u03bc(g)\u03c7k (g)\u03b4 (g, g(\u03b3)) i = h \u03c7k (g(\u03b3)) i\nG\n\nExpression (8) shows that the coefficients \u03c8k (\u03b3) are the vacuum expectation values of the traces of parallel transporters calculated in the k-th\nrepresentation of the group G:\n\uf8eb\n\n\u03c8k (\u03b3) = h Tr P exp \uf8edi\n\nZ\n\n\u03bc\n\ndx\n\n\u03b3\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\u00c2\u03bc(k) \uf8f8\n\ni\n\n(9)\n\nIt is convenient to express the quantities \u03c8k (\u03b3) in terms of the Wilson loops\nWk (\u03b3) which are conventionally used in nonperturbative QCD [5, 7, 8]:\n\uf8eb\n\n\uf8ed\nWk (\u03b3) = d\u22121\nk h Tr P exp i\n\n4\n\nZ\n\u03b3\n\n\uf8f6\n\n\uf8f8i\ndx\u03bc \u00c2(k)\n\u03bc\n\n(10)\n\n\fwhere dk is the dimensionality of k-th representation. Using Wilson loops\none can rewrite decomposition (7) as:\n\u03c8(g; \u03b3) =\n\nX\n\n\u03c7\u0304k (g)dk Wk (\u03b3)\n\n(11)\n\nk\n\nSuch decomposition clarifies the physical meaning of the amplitude \u03c8(g; \u03b3):\nas the Wilson loop calculated in k-th representation characterizes interaction\nof static colour charges in this representation [6, 7, 8], the function \u03c8(g; \u03b3)\ndescribes simultaneously interaction between colour charges in all representations.\n\n3\n\nWilson area law and Casimir scaling\n\nIn the previous section we have managed to express the amplitude \u03c8(g; \u03b3)\nin terms of Wilson loops, which are physically observable, gauge-invariant\nquantities. The properties of Wilson loops are known from lattice simulations and from predictions of different phenomenological models [5, 6, 7, 8].\nThe most general conclusion which can be drawn basing on the lattice data\nobtained for Yang-Mills theory without quarks is the validity of Wilson area\nlaw and Casimir scaling. In general both Casimir scaling and Wilson area\nlaw can be violated at large distances due to screening effects, especially in\nthe presence of dynamical fermions, but in lattice simulations of pure SU(3)\nYang-Mills theory no such violation was found up to the largest available\ndistances [9, 10]. The level of violation did not exceed few percents in the\nresults [10] and 5 \u2212 15% in the measurements of [9]. Extrapolation to the\ncontinuum limit performed in [10] indicated no violation of Casimir scaling\nexcept statistical errors, of the order of 1%. Casimir scaling holds also for\nsmall distances, as is indicated by perturbative calculations with two loops\n[15]. However some theoretical considerations predict that violation may occur [6, 16]. Thus we will restrict our analysis to the case of intermediate\ndistances (\u223c 0.2 . . . 1 fm) where the validity of both Wilson area law and\nCasimir scaling is checked with good precision.\nWilson area law means that Wk (\u03b3) = exp(\u2212\u03c3k S\u03b3 ), where \u03c3k is the tension\nof QCD string between charges in k-th representation [6, 7, 8] and S\u03b3 is the\nminimal area of the surface spanned on the loop \u03b3. Wilson area law implies\nlinear interaction potential V (R) = \u03c3k R between static colour charges [5].\nIf Casimir scaling holds, the tension \u03c3k is proportional to the eigenvalue of\n5\n\n\fquadratic Casimir operator in k-th representation: \u03c3k = \u03c3Ck , where \u03c3 is\nsome constant. It can be shown using the field correlator method that \u03c3\nis proportional to the density of nonperturbative gluonic condensate \u03c3 \u223c\nh Tr F\u0302\u03bc\u03bd F\u0302 \u03bc\u03bd i [7, 8]. Expansion (11) can be now rewritten as:\n\u03c8(g; \u03b3) =\n\nX\n\n\u03c7\u0304k (g)dk exp (\u2212\u03c3Ck S\u03b3 )\n\n(12)\n\nk\n\nAfter differentiating (12) over S\u03b3 one obtains:\nX\nd\n\u03c8(g; \u03b3) =\n\u2212\u03c3Ck \u03c7\u0304k (g) dk exp (\u2212\u03c3Ck S\u03b3 )\ndS\u03b3\nk\n\n(13)\n\nIn order to rewrite (12) and (13) in a compact beautiful form it is convenient to use some geometric constructions on the group manifold. Suppose\nthat the elements of the group G are parameterized by the coordinates \u03bb\u03b1 .\nThe metrics on the group manifold (Killing form) is fixed up to a constant\nmultiplier by requiring the infinitesimal distance to be invariant under left\nand right group multiplications [13, 14, 17]. The metric tensor of the form:\ng\u03b1\u03b2 (g) = Tr\n\n\u2202\n\u2202\nT\u0302 (g) \u03b2 T\u0302 \u2020 (g)\n\u03b1\n\u2202\u03bb\n\u2202\u03bb\n\n!\n\n(14)\n\nwith T\u0302 (g) being the matrix of some irreducible unitary representation (for\nexample, fundamental) of q\nthe group G, satisfies this condition [13, 14]. The\nQ\nHaar measure is d\u03bc(g) = det g\u03b1\u03b2 d\u03bb\u03b4 . Group structure of the manifold\n\u03b4\n\nalso induces the connection on it, which can be used to build the covariant\nderivative \u2207\u03b1 [17]. An important property of \u2207\u03b1 is that the curvature tensor\nassociated with it is equal to zero, thus group manifold has zero curvature\n\u03b3\n\u03b3\nbut nonzero torsion S\u03b1\u03b2\n: [\u2207\u03b1 , \u2207\u03b2 ] = S\u03b1\u03b2\n\u2207\u03b3 . An essential fact is that covariant derivatives acting on the Hilbert space of smooth functions on group\nmanifold build a reducible infinite-dimensional representation of the Lie algebra of the group G [13, 17] which contains all irreducible finite-dimensional\nrepresentations. Group laplacian \u2206 is the quadratic Casimir operator of this\nreducible representation:\n\u2206 = g \u03b1\u03b2 \u2207\u03b1 \u2207\u03b2\n(15)\nGroup laplacian was introduced by Berezin in [18]. Subspaces of irreducible\nrepresentations are the eigenspaces of \u2206 corresponding to eigenvalues \u2212Ck .\n6\n\n\fFor instance, for the characters of irreducible representations we have [13,\n14, 18]:\n\u2206\u03c7k (g) = \u2212Ck \u03c7k (g)\n(16)\nThe equation (13) can be now rewritten as:\nX\nd\n\u03c8(g; \u03b3) =\n\u03c3\u2206\u03c7\u0304k (g) dk exp (\u2212\u03c3Ck S\u03b3 ) = \u03c3\u2206\u03c8(g; \u03b3)\ndS\u03b3\nk\n\n(17)\n\nThus the final result for the amplitude \u03c8(g; \u03b3) has the form of the Schr\u00f6dinger\nequation on the group manifold [22, 23] with S\u03b3 playing the role of the\neuclidean time:\nd\n\u03c8(g; \u03b3) = \u03c3\u2206\u03c8(g; \u03b3)\n(18)\ndS\u03b3\nInitial condition for the equation (18) is \u03c8(g; \u03b3)|S\u03b3 =0 = \u03b4(g, 1), which means\nthat for infinitely small loops parallel transport operator is always equal to\nidentity. Equation (18) is also known as the diffusion equation on the group\nmanifold [19, 20].\nFinally we would like to discuss how possible violation of Casimir scaling due to screening effects can be taken into account. From general analysis based on the cumulant expansion of Wilson loops [7, 8] it is known\nthat Casimir scaling is violated by contributions to the string tension which\nare proportional to higher-order Casimir operators. As covariant derivatives\nbuild a representation of the Lie algebra of the gauge group, in order to reproduce higher-order Casimir operators one should act on \u03c8(g; \u03b3) with covariant\nderivatives more than twice, which leads to the following generalization of\nthe equation (18):\nX\nd\n\u03c8(g; \u03b3) =\n\u03c3 \u03b11 ...\u03b1l (\u03b3)\u2207\u03b11 . . . \u2207\u03b1l \u03c8(g; \u03b3)\ndS\u03b3\nl\n\n(19)\n\nGauge invariance imposes rather strict constraints on the tensor structure\nof the coefficients \u03c3 \u03b11 ...\u03b1l (\u03b3). Violation of the Wilson area law can be implemented in the functional dependence of \u03c3 \u03b11 ...\u03b1l (\u03b3) on \u03b3. Such equation is\nknown in the theory of random walks and diffusions as the Kramers-Moyall\nexpansion [21]. Application of this equation to the description of Wilson\nloops in QCD deserves separate discussion and will be investigated in subsequent publications.\n\n7\n\n\f4\n\nPath integral solution and two-dimensional\nYang-Mills theory\n\nLet us now consider the set of rectangular loops \u03b3R\u00d7t which stretch the time\nt and the distance R. Assuming that R is constant, one can rewrite (18) as\nthe Schr\u00f6dinger equation on the group manifold [22] in euclidean time t:\nd\n\u03c8(g, t) = \u03c3R \u2206\u03c8(g, t)\ndt\n\n(20)\n\nwhere by \u03c8(g, t) we denoted the amplitude for the rectangular loop of the size\nR \u00d7 t. Typically such rectangular Wilson loop is used to describe interaction\nof two static colour charges separated by distance R.\nThe equation (20) is a Schr\u00f6dinger equation for a point on the group\nmanifold [22, 23] with the following lagrangian:\nL = (4\u03c3R)\u22121 g\u03b1\u03b2\n\nd\u03bb\u03b1 d\u03bb\u03b2\ndt dt\n\n(21)\n\nJust as in the case of quantum mechanics in euclidean three-dimensional\nspace, solutions of the equation (20) can be expressed in terms of path integrals [23, 24] with this lagrangian and the proper integration measure:\n\u03c8(g, t) =\n\nf (t)=g\nZ\n\nf (0)=1\n\n\uf8eb\n\n1\nD\u03bc [f (t)] exp \uf8ed\u2212\n4\u03c3R\n\nZt\n0\n\n\uf8f6\n\nd\u03bb\u03b1 d\u03bb\u03b2 \uf8f8\nd\u03c4 g\u03b1\u03b2 (\u03c7)\nd\u03c4 d\u03c4\n\n(22)\n\nIn this expression integration is performed over all paths on the group manifold which begin at the time \u03c4 = 0 in the identity and end at the time \u03c4 = t\nin the point g. In (22) f (\u03c4 ) is the group element passed at time \u03c4 , \u03bb\u03b1 (\u03c4 ) are\nQ\nthe coordinates which correspond to f (\u03c4 ) and D\u03bc [f (t)] = d\u03bc (f (\u03c4 )) is the\n\u03c4\n\npath-integral measure [22]. Substituting (14) in the lagrangian (21) we find\nthe action in the path integral:\nS [f (\u03c4 )] = (4\u03c3R)\n\n\u22121\n\nZt\n\nTr\n\n0\n\ndT\u0302 \u2020 (g(\u03c4 ))\ndT\u0302 (g(\u03c4 ))\nd\u03c4\n\n!\n\n(23)\n\nwhere g(\u03c4 ) is the group element corresponding to the loop \u03b3R\u00d7\u03c4 . Now remember that T\u0302 (g(\u03c4 )) is the parallel transporter along this loop. Writing the\n8\n\n\fdifferentials in (23) as infinitesimal differences, we obtain for the action (23):\nRt\n\nS = (4\u03c3R d\u03c4 )\u22121 Tr\nRt\n\n0\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0010h\n\nih\n\n\u0011\n\n= (4\u03c3R d\u03c4 )\u22121 Tr 2I\u02c6 \u2212 T\u0302 (g(\u03b3R\u00d7d\u03c4 )) \u2212 T\u0302 \u2020 (g(\u03b3R\u00d7d\u03c4 )) =\n0\n\nt\n\n\u0010\n\n\u0011\n\nR\n\u02c6 \u22121 Re Tr \u00db (\u03b3R\u00d7d\u03c4 ) =\n= Tr I\u02c6 (2\u03c3R d\u03c4 )\u22121 1 \u2212 (Tr I)\n0\n\nRt\n\ni\u0011\n\nT\u0302 (g(\u03c4 + d\u03c4 )) \u2212 T\u0302 (g(\u03c4 )) T\u0302 \u2020 (g(\u03c4 + d\u03c4 )) \u2212 T\u0302 \u2020 (g(\u03c4 ))\n\n= Tr I\u02c6 (2\u03c3R d\u03c4 )\u22121 (1 \u2212 Re W (\u03b3R\u00d7d\u03c4 ))\n0\n\n(24)\nwhere \u03b3R\u00d7d\u03c4 is the rectangular loop of size R \u00d7 d\u03c4 situated in the point\n\u03c4 on the time axis (such loop can be though of as the difference\nof two\n!\nR\ndx\u03bc \u00c2(k)\n. Thus we\nloops \u03b3R\u00d7(\u03c4 +d\u03c4 ) and \u03b3R\u00d7\u03c4 ) and \u00db (\u03b3R\u00d7d\u03c4 ) = P exp i\n\u03bc\n\u03b3R\u00d7d\u03c4\n\narrive at the geometric interpretation of the action term (21): it is expressed\nin terms of the Wilson loop for an infinitely thin contour of size R \u00d7 d\u03c4 .\nOne can expand \u00db(\u03b3R\u00d7d\u03c4 ) in powers of loop area using the non-Abelian\nStokes theorem [25, 26], which shows that the first nonvanishing term in\n1 \u2212 ReWk (\u03b3R\u00d7d\u03c4 ) is proportional to the square of the loop area, therefore the\naction differential is of order d\u03c4 , and the integral in (24) is mathematically\nwell-defined.\nNote that the action term in (24) resembles the Wilson action for twodimensional QCD. This resemblance is not accidental and provides another\npossibility to treat the equation (18). Consider pure two-dimensional YangMills theory with gauge group G on the surface of the minimal area S\u03b3\nspanned on the loop \u03b3 and fix the boundary condition by assuming that\nthe parallel transporter along the loop \u03b3 (calculated using the connection of\ntwo-dimensional theory) is equal to some group element g. Such theory is\nexactly solvable, which was first demonstrated in the remarkable paper by\nMigdal [27]. For instance, partition function of the theory is:\nZ(g, S\u03b3 ) =\n\nX\n\ndk \u03c7k (g) exp(\u2212\u03c32D Ck S\u03b3 )\n\n(25)\n\nk\n\nwhere \u03c32D is some constant which depends on the normalization of the coupling constant. By definition partition function is the sum over all field\nconfigurations of our two-dimensional theory which satisfy the boundary condition. The function Z(g, S\u03b3 ) becomes the solution of the equation (18) with\nthe proper initial conditions Z(g, 0) = \u03b4(g, 1), if one assumes \u03c32D = \u03c3. Thus\n9\n\n=\n\n\ftwo-dimensional pure Yang-Mills theory living on the surface S\u03b3 satisfies the\nequation (18). This could be expected, since both Casimir scaling and Wilson area law are exact for such theory. It is interesting whether the equation\n(19) can also be solved by means of some path integral.\n\n5\n\nConclusions\n\nIn this work we have analyzed the behavior of a single loop variable in quantum gauge field. The amplitude which corresponds to the probability distribution of loop variables on the group manifold was expressed in terms of the\nWilson loops in different representations of the gauge group. It was shown\nthat the Wilson area law and the Casimir scaling can be united, leading to\nthe free Schr\u00f6dinger equation on the group manifold with euclidean \"time\"\nbeing the area of the surface spanned on the loop. Possible screening effects\ncan be taken into account if one uses a generalization of the simple diffusion\nequation (18) known as the Kramers-Moyall expansion.\nThe solution of the obtained equation was written in terms of the pathintegral and the corresponding action term was analyzed. It turned out that\nthe action differential can be linearly expressed in terms of an infinitely thin\nWilson loop, which resembles the Wilson action for two-dimensional YangMills theory. Next we demonstrated that pure two-dimensional Yang-Mills\ntheory living on the surface S\u03b3 spanned on the loop \u03b3 also solves the equation (18). This points at some relation between two-dimensional and fourdimensional gauge theories, which is known in somewhat different context in\nlattice gauge theory as the dimensional reduction scenario [12]. One can also\nsurmise that two-dimensional gauge theory can provide some approximate solution of the quantum loop equations of four-dimensional theory [1, 2, 3, 4],\nbut this possibility require further investigations.\nAs a further development of this result it can be useful to look at the\njoint probability distribution of two or more loop variables. The case of loops\nwith self-intersections can be particularly interesting in connection with the\nquantum loop equations [1, 2, 3, 4].\n\n10\n\n\fReferences\n[1] A. M.
