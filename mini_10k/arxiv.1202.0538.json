The common feature of\nall the Fe-based superconductor compounds is that they\nhave FeX layers (X=P, As, S, Se or Te) composed of\nedge-sharing tetrahedra with an Fe center. Furthermore,\nsome of the parent compounds of these superconductors\nare antiferromagnetic (AFM) semimetals5 with either a\ncollinear6,7 or bi-collinear8,9 AFM order below a structural transition temperature. The superconductivity can\nbe induced either by hole or electron doping via chemical\nsubstitution or by high pressure, and the superconducting paring is believed to occur in the FeX layers.\nIn Fe-based superconductors, it was widely believed\nthat the As-bridged antiferromagnetic superexchange interaction between the next nearest neighbors Fe-Fe atoms\nplays an important role7,10 . This kind of interaction depends strongly on the local geometry of a Fe-As bond.\nIndeed, it was found that the geometry of the FeX4\ntetrahedral unit, in particular the bond length and the\nbond angle between two neighboring X and Fe ions,\nstrongly correlates with the superconductivity transition\ntemperature11,12 . Besides applying pressure, growing\nan Fe-based superconductor on some substrate is another effective way to manipulate the lattice parameters\nand the FeX4 tetrahedral geometry, which may tune the\nsuperconducting transition temperature. As an orthodox metal oxide perovskite, Strontium titanate (SrTiO3 )\nis widely used as a high-quality substrate for epitaxial growth of high-temperature cuprate superconductors\nand many other oxide-based thin films13 . Very recently,\nSrTiO3 has been used as a substrate to epitaxially grow\nFeSe ultrathin films14 . It is found that the monolayer\nFeSe thin film grown on SrTiO3 (001) shows signatures\nof superconducting transition above 50 K by transport\nmeasurement, while the bilayer and thicker films, in contrast, do not show any sign of superconductivity14 .\n\nTo understand the physics underlying this remarkable finding, we have performed the first-principles electronic structure calculations on FeSe monolayer and bilayer ultrathin films on SrTiO3 (001), respectively. We\nfind that both monolayer and bilayer thin films show a\nsemiconducting behavior with a collinear AFM order on\nFe atoms, substantially different from the metallic bulk\nFeSe. Considering the difference between the single FeSe\nand multi-layer FeSe thin films, this suggests that the observed superconductivity happens either at the interface\nof FeSe-SrTiO3 or just in the first FeSe layer, not in the\nother FeSe layers.\nCrystal SrTiO3 is built from alternatively stacking planar SrO and TiO2 square layers along the c-axis. Experimentally, bulk SrTiO3 takes a structural phase transition\nfrom cubic perovskite structure into a tetragonal one at\n105K, in which each octahedral unit TiO6 with titanium\ncentered slightly rotates around the z axis, meanwhile\nthe rotation directions between the nearest neighboring\noctahedral units are reverse with each other15,16 . Such a\nstructural distortion is thus called antiferrodistortion.\nThe cleaving of SrTiO3 simultaneously generates both\nSrO-terminated and TiO2 -terminated surfaces with the\ncorresponding cleavage energy equally distributed between these two surfaces17,18 . It was further shown that\nthe surface energies are nearly the same for these two\nsurfaces after full relaxation18,19 . This means that both\nsurfaces are stable and either of them may be used as\na substrate to grow FeSe thin films. We thus study\nFeSe monolayer and bilayer on both TiO2 -terminated\nand SrO-terminated SrTiO3 (001), respectively.\n\nII.\n\nCOMPUTATIONAL DETAILS\n\nTo study the atomic structures\nand magnetic properties of FeSe\nSrTiO3 (001), we carried out the\nfirst-principles electronic structure\n\nand the electronic\nultrathin films on\nfully spin-polarized\ncalculations by us-\n\n\f2\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nN\u00e9el\n\nFe\nSe\nO\nTi\nSr\n\n(d)\n\ny\nx Collinear\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) Atomic structures (a)I and (b)II of\nmonolayer FeSe on TiO2 -terminated SrTiO3 (001) surface.\nPatterns of Fe atom spins in the (c)checkerboard antiferromagnetic N\u00e9el state and (d)the collinear antiferromagnetic\nstate.\n\ning the projector augmented wave (PAW) method20,21 .\nWe adopted the generalized gradient approximation of\nPerdew-Burke-Ernzerhof22 for the exchange-correlation\npotentials. After the full convergence test, the kinetic\nenergy cut-off of the plane wave basis was chosen to be\n400 eV. The optimization made the forces on all relaxed\natoms smaller than 0.02 eV/\u00c5.\nWe first checked the properties of bulk SrTiO3 . We\nconstructed a 20-atom tetragonal supercell so that we\ncan describe\n\u221a\n\u221athe antiferrodistortive structure, which unit\ncell is 2 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 2 unit cell of undistortive bulk SrTiO3 .\nThe Brillouin zone was sampled with a 6 \u00d7 6 \u00d7 6 kpoint mesh. After both the shape and volume of the\nsupercell and the internal atomic positions were optimized, we find that SrTiO3 has indeed an antiferrodistortive tetragonal\nstructure with the lattice parameters\n\u221a\na\u22c6 = b\u22c6 = 2a = 5.536 \u00c5 and c\u22c6 = 2c = 7.831 \u00c5 (a and\nc being the lattice parameters of the undistortive tetragonal unit cell), the octahedral rotation angle \u03b8=1.1\u25e6 , and\nthe ratio (c/a)-1=3\u00d710\u22124. These values agree well with\nthe experimental data16 a\u22c6 = b\u22c6 = 5.507 \u00c5, c\u22c6 = 7.796 \u00c5,\n\u03b8=2.1\u25e6 , and (c/a) \u2212 1 = 10 \u00d7 10\u22124 , respectively, as well\nas with the previous calculation results23 .\nTo model FeSe ultrathin films on TiO2 (SrO)- terminated SrTiO3 (001), we used a 6 (7)-layer SrTiO3 (001)\nslab with FeSe monolayer\n\u221a\n\u221aand bilayer FeSe adsorbed on\nthe top side in a 2a \u00d7 2a two-dimensional supercell\nplus a vacuum layer of about 10 \u00c5. The top two slab layers and all FeSe layer atoms were allowed to relax while\nthe rest slab layers were fixed at their bulk positions. A\n6\u00d76\u00d71 k-point mesh for the Brillouin zone sampling and\nthe Gaussian smearing technique with a width of 0.1 eV\nwere used. The electric field induced by asymmetric slab\nrelaxation was compensated by a dipole correction24 .\nIII.\n\nFig. 2 (a) and (b), respectively. The nonmagnetic, the\nferromagnetic, the checkerboard antiferromagnetic N\u00e9el,\nand the collinear antiferromagnetic states were all calculated. Patterns of Fe atom spins in the checkerboard\nantiferromagnetic N\u00e9el and the collinear antiferromagnetic states are shown in panels (c) and (d) of Fig. 1 and\nFig. 2, respectively. To better understand the electronic\nproperties of FeSe thin films on SrTiO3 , the electronic\nband structures of clean SrTiO3 surface and isolated FeSe\nmonolayer are firstly introduced in subsection A. Results of monolayer and bilayer FeSe ultrathin films on\nTiO2 -terminated and SrO-terminated SrTiO3 are then\npresented in subsection B and C, respectively.\nFigure 1 shows the atomic structures of monolayer\nFeSe on TiO2 -terminated SrTiO3 surface. For structure\nI in panel (a), Se atom locates on top of the Ti atom,\nwhich substitutes the position of O atom in TiO6 octahedron of bulk SrTiO3 . For structure II in panel (b),\nSe atom sits on the center site of the Ti-Ti square. The\natomic structures of monolayer FeSe on SrO-terminated\nSrTiO3 surface are shown in Fig. 2. For structure I in\npanel (a), Se atom locates on top of the O atom. As to\nthe structure II in panel (b), Se atom is on top of the Sr\natom. By considering the symmetry of both the ad-layer\nand the substrate, these four structures in Figs. 1 and 2\nare the most possible adsorption sites.\n\nA.\n\nClean SrTiO3 surface and isolated FeSe\nmonolayer\n\nIn order to have a concept about how the electronic\nstructures of FeSe-SrTiO3 heterostructures are derived\nfrom their subdivisions, we firstly studied the band\nstructures of TiO2 - and SrO-terminated SrTiO3 (001)\nclean surfaces and isolated FeSe monolayer. For SrOterminated surface, the atomic structure\na 7-layer\n\u221a of \u221a\nslab is the same as the substrate of 2a \u00d7 2a twodimensional supercell in Fig. 2.

This corresponds to 3.91 \u00c5 for the\nin-plane distance of Se-Se atom. We also checked the\ncase of 3.8 \u00c5 as reported in the experiment14 . There is\nno meaningful change found.\nFigure 3 shows the band structures of clean TiO2 and SrO-terminated SrTiO3 surface in panel (a) and\n(b), \u221a\nrespectively.\nThe surface Brillouin zone (SBZ) of\n\u221a\nthe 2a \u00d7 2a two-dimensional supercell is shown as\nthe inset of panel (a). In the following of the paper,\nwe always use the same SBZ since all structures studied have the same two-dimensional supercell. As can be\nseen from panel (a) for TiO2 -terminated surface, there\nare two nearly degenerated valence bands separated from\nthe conduction bands by a gap of about 1 eV. These two\nvalence bands are derived from the 2p orbitals of O atoms\nin the surface TiO2 layers of the two-sided slab. The\nbottom of the conduction band is contributed by the 3d\norbitals of Ti atoms in the deep layers. As a contrast,\nfor SrO-terminated surface in panel (b), the top valence\nband is formed by the 2p orbitals of O atoms in the deep\nlayers while the bottom conduction band originates from\nthe 3d orbitals of subsurface Ti atoms. The band gaps of\nclean SrTiO3 surface are thus determined by the orbitals\nof O and Ti atoms for both terminations. These results\nare consistent with the previous calculations18,19 .\nThe band structures of isolated FeSe monolayer with\nlattice parameter of 3.91 \u00c5 in the nonmagnetic and\ncollinear antiferromagnetic states are shown in Fig. 4 (a)\nand (b), respectively. As we see, there are two electrontype bands and two hole-type bands around \u0393 point in\nthe nonmagnetic state, which is due\n\u221a to the\n\u221a band folding effect since here the unit cell is 2 \u00d7 2 unit cell of\nbulk FeSe on ab-plane. In the collinear antiferromagnetic\nstate, an obvious feature is the Dirac-Cone-like bands at\n\u0393 point along M \u2212 \u0393\u2212 X with the Fermi level slightly below the Dirac point and the tiny density of states at the\nFermi level.

The main difference between (a) and (b) is the relative position of the band\nat \u0393 point just below the Fermi level (blue line in panel\n(a) and yellow line in panel (b)). This band touches the\nFermi level at \u0393 point for structure I while it falls below\nthe Fermi level for structure II, which corresponds to the\nvalence band of the substrate.\nBy comparing the energies of the nonmagnetic state,\nferromagnetic state, checkerboard antiferromagnetic N\u00e9el\nstate, and collinear antiferromagnetic state, we find that\nthe ground state is the collinear antiferromagnetic state\nwith a large magnetic moment of 2.5 \u03bcB on each Fe atom\nfor both structures I and II. In the ground state, the\nvertical distances of Se atom to the TiO2 plane are 3.06\n\u00c5 and 3.16 \u00c5 in structure I and II, respectively. The\ntotal energy of structure I is lower by 0.2 eV than that\nof structure II. These indicate that the FeSe monolayer\nhas a stronger bonding with the substrate in structure I\nthan in structure II.\nFigure 6 shows the band structures of structure I and\nII for the monolayer FeSe on TiO2 -terminated SrTiO3\nin the collinear antiferromagnetic state. Compared with\nFig. 3(a) and Fig. 4(b), the bands of structure I in Fig.\n6(a) seems to be a superposition of the bands of separated\nsubstrate and FeSe monolayer. The Fermi level is pinned\non the top of valence band of TiO2 -terminated SrTiO3 ,\ni.e. Dirac-Cone-like bands of FeSe lining up the Fermi\nlevel with the parabolic valence band of the substrate.\nHowever, such a parabolic band shifts downwards away\nfrom the Fermi level for the structure II in panel (b).\nIn order to clarify the contributions to the bands near\nFermi level from different orbitals, we plot the orbitalresolved partial density of states for structures I and II\nof the monolayer FeSe on TiO2 -terminated SrTiO3 in the\n\nFe 3d up\n\n-2\n\nFe 3d dn\n\nSe 4p up\n\nSr 4p up\n\nTi 3d up\n\nO 2p up\n\n(b)\n2\n\n0\n\n-2\n-4\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\nEnergy (eV)\n\nFIG. 7: (Color online) Orbital-resolved partial density of\nstates of (a) structure I and (b) structure II for monolayer\nFeSe on TiO2 -terminated SrTiO3 in collinear antiferromagnetic state.

The main difference\nbetween panels (a) and (b) is that the 2p orbitals of surface O atoms (red dash dot dot line) in TiO2 -terminated\nSrTiO3 show states near the Fermi level for structure I,\nwhile they are absent for structure II. This indicates that\nthe parabolic valence band just below the Fermi level in\nFig. 6 belongs to surface O atoms, which is further confirmed by the band decomposed charge density shown in\nFig. 8. As can be seen from the side and top views in Fig.\n8, this parabolic valence band originates from the px and\npy orbitals of surface O atoms in the TiO2 termination\nlayer.\n\n-1.0\nM\n\nX\n\nM\n\nX'\n\nFIG. 6: (Color online) Band structures of (a)structure I\nand (b)structure II for monolayer FeSe on TiO2 -terminated\nSrTiO3 in collinear antiferromagnetic state along high symmetric directions of SBZ, in which \u0393X corresponds to the\nspins in parallel and \u0393X \u2032 to the spins in anti-parallel.

The Fermi energy is set\nto zero.\n\nBy comparing the energies of the nonmagnetic state,\nferromagnetic state, checkerboard antiferromagnetic N\u00e9el\nstate, and collinear antiferromagnetic state, we find that\nthe ground state of monolayer FeSe on SrO-terminated\nSrTiO3 is also the collinear antiferromagnetic state with\na large magnetic moment, similar to the case of TiO2 termination. In this state, the vertical distances of Se atom\nto the TiO2 plane are 3.67 \u00c5 and 3.64 \u00c5 in structure\nI and II, respectively. The total energy of structure II is\nslightly lower by 0.06 eV than that of structure I.\nFigure 12 shows the band structures of structure I and\nII for the monolayer FeSe on SrO-terminated SrTiO3 in\nthe collinear antiferromagnetic state. The bands near the\nFermi level look like the superposition of the bands of the\nsubstrate in Fig. 3(b) and the isolated FeSe monolayer in\nFig. 4(b), similar to the case of TiO2 -termination.

The O-s denotes surface O atom in SrO termination layer and the Oc is O atom in the TiO2 deep layers.

However, the\nO atoms in the TiO2 deep layers contribute more to the\nstates near Fermi level than the surface O atoms in the\nSrO termination.

Thus there is\nno strong chemical bonding between the FeSe layer and\nthe substrate SrTiO3 . This implies that the electronic\nband structure of FeSe ultrathin films on SrTiO3 would\nresult from the band lineup at the interface between the\nFeSe thin film and substrate SrTiO3 . The calculations\nindeed confirm this picture, as shown in Figs. 3, 4, 6,\n9, 12, and 15. The Fermi level of FeSe thin films is\nfound to locate at the top of the valence band of substrate\nSrTiO3 . The top valence band of TiO2 -terminated substrate mainly consists of O-2p orbitals within TiO2 surface layer while O-2p orbitals within deep TiO2 layers for\nSrO-terminated substrate. This band can become conducting by a small amount of hole-doping or by applying\na small positive gate voltage. In the experiment of FeSeSrTiO3 heterostructure reported in Ref. 14, the superconductivity was found in the FeSe monolayer absorbed\nonto the TiO2 -terminated substrate, but not in the bilayer films. Our calculations show that the electronic\nband structures of FeSe monolayer and bilayer on TiO2 termination have similar band structures. Both show a\nsemiconducting behavior. This may suggest that the observed superconductivity happens either just in the interface of FeSe-SrTiO3 heterostructures or in the first layer\nof FeSe, and the superconducting gap could not be observed in the double FeSe thin films by the experimental\nmeasurements because the tunneling current was blocked\nby the second FeSe layer.\n\n0\n\nAcknowledgments\n\n-2\n-4\n\n-3\n\n-2\n\n-1\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\nEnergy (eV)\n\nFIG. 16: (Color online) Orbital-resolved partial density of\nstates of (a)structure I and (b)structure II for monolayer\nFeSe on SrO-terminated SrTiO3 in collinear antiferromagnetic\nstate.
