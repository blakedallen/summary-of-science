Introduction\nBy separation of variables in spherical polar coordinates, the Dirac operator of relativistic quantum mechanics with a Coulomb potential,\nH0 := \u2212i\u03b1 * \u2207 + \u03b2 +\n\nc\n,\n|x|\n\nwhere c < 0 and \u03b11 , \u03b12 , \u03b13 and \u03b2 = \u03b10 are symmetric 4 \u00d7 4 matrices satisfying the\nanticommutation relations\n\u03b1i \u03b1j + \u03b1j \u03b1i = \u03b4ij\n\n(i, j \u2208 {0, 1, 2, 3}),\n\nis unitarily equivalent to a direct sum of one-dimensional Dirac operators on the halfline,\nd\nk\nc\nH0 (k) = \u2212i\u03c32\n+ \u03c33 + \u03c31 +\n(r \u2208 (0, \u221e)),\ndr\nr\nr\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n0 1\n0 \u2212i\n1 0\nwhere \u03c31 =\n, \u03c32 =\nand \u03c33 =\nare the Pauli matrices\n1 0\ni 0\n0 \u22121\nand k \u2208 ZZ \\ {0} is the angular momentum quantum number [13, Appendix to Section\n1]. For an electron orbiting a nucleus of charge number Z \u2208 IN, the Coulomb coupling\nconstant is c = \u2212Z\u03b1, with the Sommerfeld fine structure constant \u03b1 \u2248 1/137.\n1\n\n\fH0 (k) is essentially self-adjoint on its minimal domain if and only if c2 \u2264 k 2 \u2212 1/4\n[13, Theorem 6.9]. For c2 \u2208 (k 2 \u2212 1/4, k 2 ), there still exists a distinguished self-adjoint\nextension, characterised by the requirement that the wave-functions in its domain have\na finite potential (or kinetic) energy [13, Theorem 6.10].\nPauli suggested a modification of the Dirac operator which takes into account the\nanomalous magnetic moment of the electron (for the historical background cf. [7]).\nWith suitably normalised constants, the operator with a potential V for an electron of\nmagnetic moment (1 + a)\u03bcB , where \u03bcB is the Bohr magneton, takes the form\nHa = \u2212i\u03b1 * \u2207 + \u03b2 + V \u2212 ia\u03b1 * \u2207V.\nIn the case of the Coulomb potential, the corresponding half-line operators after variable\nseparation will be\nd\nHa (k) = \u2212i\u03c32\n+ \u03c33 +\ndr\n\n\u0012\n\nk\na\n+ 2\nr\nr\n\n\u0013\n\n\u03c31 +\n\nc\nr\n\n(r \u2208 (0, \u221e)).\n\nThe mathematical investigation of the properties of this operator was initiated by\nBehncke [2, 3, 4]. Ha (k) is essentially self-adjoint on its minimal domain for all values\nc < 0 of the coupling constant (cf. [1, 5]). The essential spectrum of Ha (k), as that of\nH0 (k), is (\u2212\u221e, \u22121] \u222a [1, \u221e).\nLet us now focus on the case c2 < k 2 , so that a distinguished self-adjoint realisation\nof H0 (k) exists. We always assume a < 0 in the following; the case of positive a can be\nreduced to this (with a sign change of k) by a suitable unitary transformation. Although\nonly integer values of k are relevant for the three-dimensional operator, we admit general\nnon-zero real values of k. As is well known, H0 (k) has infinitely many eigenvalues in\nthe spectral gap (\u22121, 1), which accumulate at 1. One would expect that the eigenvalues\nof Ha (k) will be perturbations of those of H0 (k), such that each eigenvalue of H0 (k)\nwill be the limit of exactly one eigenvalue branch of Ha (k) in the limit a \u2192 0 (spectral\nstability, cf. [8, Chapter VIII \u00a71.4]). This expectation is partly corroborated by the\nstrong resolvent convergence of Ha (k) to H0 (k), at least for c2 \u2264 k 2 \u2212 1/4, which\nimplies that the spectrum cannot suddenly expand in the limit. Nevertheless, due to\nthe strong singularity of the a/r 2 term at the origin, this limit problem is highly nontrivial and does not subject itself to the standard perturbation techniques. Behncke [4,\nTheorem 2] was able to prove spectral stability for c2 < k 2 \u2212 (3/2)2 if k < 0, and for\nc2 < k \u2212 5/2 if k > 0.\nThe surprising asymmetry with respect to the sign of k is not an artefact of\nBehncke's method, but inherent in the problem, as observed in the recent treatment [7],\nwhere spectral stability was proved, based on an asymptotic analysis of the (non-linear)\nPr\u00fcfer and Riccati equations equivalent to the Dirac system\n(Ha (k) \u2212 \u03bb)u = 0,\n\n(1)\n\nfor all c \u2208 (k, 0) if k < 0, and for all c \u2208 (\u2212k, 0) \\ {c0 , c1 , . . .} if k > 0. Here cj \u2208 (\u2212k, 0),\nwith cj > cj+1 , are certain exceptional values of the coupling constant at which a\n2\n\n\ftransition in the behaviour of the eigenfunctions of Ha (k) occurs: for c \u2208 (cn , cn\u22121 ),\nthe eigenfunctions of Ha (k) show n additional rapid oscillations very close to the origin,\ncompared to the corresponding eigenfunctions of H0 (k). It remains a fairly subtle open\nquestion whether or not spectral stability holds if c is equal to one of the exceptional\nvalues.\nThe present note is devoted to a study of the number and positions of the exceptional values of c for a given k > 0.\n2. Exceptional values\nThe exceptional values for c appear in a stability analysis of the differential equation\n[7, Eq.(1)]\n1\n\u033a\u03b8\u2032 (\u033a) = c + (k \u2212 ) sin 2\u03b8\n(\u033a > 0).\n(2)\n\u033a\nThis equation arises from the Pr\u00fcfer transformation (cf. Appendix A) of the Dirac\nsystem (1) after omitting the lowest-order term at 0, \u03c33 \u2212 \u03bb, and rescaling r = |a|\u033a to\nabsorb the parameter a.\nIn the limit \u033a \u2192 \u221e, the right-hand side of (2) - which is \u03c0-periodic in \u03b8 - has\nasymptotic zeros \u03b8\u00b1 (c, k) satisfying 0 < \u03b8\u2212 (c, k) < \u03c0/4 < \u03b8+ (c, k) < \u03c0/2,\n\u221a\nk \u00b1 k 2 \u2212 c2\nc\ntan \u03b8\u00b1 (c, k) =\n.\nsin 2\u03b8\u00b1 (c, k) = \u2212 ,\nk\n\u2212c\nAn asymptotic study of the direction field of (2) for \u033a \u2192 0 and \u033a \u2192 \u221e yields the\nfollowing result, which shows that this differential equation has (up to addition of a\nconstant multiple of \u03c0) a unique unstable solution at 0 and at \u221e (see [7, Lemma 2.1,\n2.2]).\nLemma 1.\nLet k > 0 and c \u2208 (\u2212k, 0). Then the following statements hold.\na) There is a unique solution \u03b80 ( * , c) of (2) such that lim \u03b80 (\u033a, c) = \u03c0.\n\u033a\u21920\n\nAll other solutions either differ from \u03b80 by a constant integer multiple of \u03c0, or else\nsatisfy lim \u03b8(\u033a, c) = \u03c02 mod \u03c0.\n\u033a\u21920\n\nFor fixed \u033a\u02c6 > 0, \u03b80 (\u02c6\n\u033a, * ) is continuous non-decreasing.\nb) There is a unique solution \u03b8\u221e ( * , c) of (2) such that lim \u03b8\u221e (\u033a, c) = \u03b8\u2212 (c, k).\n\u033a\u2192\u221e\n\nAll other solutions either differ from \u03b8\u221e by a constant integer multiple of \u03c0, or\nelse satisfy lim \u03b8(\u033a, c) = \u03b8+ (c, k) mod \u03c0.\n\u033a\u2192\u221e\n\nFor fixed \u033a\u02c6 > 0, \u03b8\u221e (\u02c6\n\u033a, * ) is continuous and strictly decreasing.\nThe solution \u03b80 ( * , c) asymptotically corresponds to the Pr\u00fcfer angle of the L2 (0, \u221e)\nsolution of (1).\nThe exceptional values are defined as those values of c for which \u03b80 ( * , c) and\n\u03b8\u221e ( * , c) match up mod \u03c0, so that the unstable solution of (2) at 0 is unstable at\n3\n\n\finfinity as well. More precisely, in view of the monotonicity properties of \u03b80 and \u03b8\u221e\nwith respect to c, we have\nlim \u03b80 (\u033a, cm ) = \u03b8\u2212 (cm , k) \u2212 m\u03c0\n\n\u033a\u2192\u221e\n\n(m = 0, 1, 2, . . .).\n\nBy the transformation \u033a = et , \u03b8(\u033a) = \u03c6(log \u033a), the equation (2) is equivalent to\n\u03c6\u2032 (t) = c + (k \u2212 e\u2212t ) sin 2\u03c6(t)\n\n(t \u2208 IR),\n\n(3)\n\nthe differential equation for the Pr\u00fcfer angle \u03c6 (cf. Appendix A) of a IR2 -valued solution\nu of the Dirac system\n(\u2212i\u03c32\n\nd\n+ (k \u2212 e\u2212t )\u03c31 + c) u(t) = 0,\ndt\n\n(4)\n\nwhich can be rewritten using the definition of the Pauli matrices as\nu\u20321 = (e\u2212t \u2212 k)u1 \u2212 cu2 ,\n\nu\u20322 = cu1 + (k \u2212 e\u2212t )u2 .\n\nIn (4), c takes on the role of a spectral parameter, while the coefficient of \u03c31 can be\ninterpreted as a constant mass term with an exponentially decaying perturbation. In\nthe sense of the analogue of Kneser's Theorem for Dirac systems [9], this perturbation\nis subcritical, and indeed the method developed in [9] can be used to show that, for each\nk > 0, there are only finitely many exceptional values for c. Moreover, an asymptotic\nanalysis of (4) along the lines of [10; see also 12] reveals that the number of exceptional\nvalues is asymptotic to k in the limit k \u2192 \u221e with fixed ratio c/k.\nThis was verified in a computational investigation of (4) based on a piecewiseconstant approximation of the exponential function, following the approach of [11].\nThe numerical findings suggested that the number of exceptional values in (\u2212k, 0) is\nalways equal to the unique integer in [k \u2212 1, k); more precisely, whenever k reaches an\ninteger value, an additional exceptional value, initially equal to \u2212k, appears and moves\ninto the interval (\u2212k, 0) as k increases.\nThis regularity raised the suspicion that (4) has an underlying solvable structure,\nand indeed, on closer scrutiny it turns out that this equation can be analysed by means\nof a variant of the factorisation method, resulting not only in a proof of the above\nconjecture, but even in an explicit formula for the exceptional values, which makes any\nasymptotic and computational analysis of (4) superfluous.\nTheorem 1.\n\nFor given k > 0, the exceptional values for Ha (k) are given by\np\n(n \u2208 IN, n < k).\ncn\u22121 (k) = \u2212 2kn \u2212 n2\n\nConsequently there are exactly N exceptional values in (\u2212k, 0) if k \u2208 (N, N + 1],\nN \u2208 IN0 .\n4\n\n\fIn view of Theorems 1.1 and 1.2 of [7], this implies in particular that the eigenvalues of\nHa (k) converge to those of H0 (k) as a \u2192 0 if c2 < 2k \u2212 1, confirming Behncke's linear\nbound (although with a different constant). However, his conjecture [4, p. 2558] that\nspectral stability may hold for all c2 < k 2 \u2212 5/2 turns out to be very questionable.\nSince the three-dimensional Coulomb-Dirac Hamiltonian Ha is the direct sum of\nHa (k) for k \u2208 ZZ \\ {0}, we can thus infer spectral stability for this operator in all cases\nin which H0 has a distinguished self-adjoint realisation.\nCorollary 1.\nLet H0 be the Dirac operator and Ha the Dirac operator with anomalous magnetic moment with a Coulomb potential with coupling constant c \u2208 (\u22121, 0).\nThen the eigenvalues of H0 are the limits of the eigenvalues of Ha as a \u2192 0.\n3. Proof of Theorem 1\nThe following proof of Theorem 1 will be based on squaring the Dirac-type operator in\n(4), which is equivalent to deriving second-order differential equations for u1 and u2 . In\na general situation, this is usually not a good idea except to obtain a quick and rough\nheuristic result, since it involves derivatives of the coefficients and consequently requires\nunnecessarily strong regularity. In the present instance, however, we are dealing with\na specific Dirac system with analytic coefficients, and as it turns out, the resulting\nsecond-order equation system decouples and can be solved by the factorisation method\nin the relevant cases (the second-order equation (5) is closely related to the radial\nSchr\u00f6dinger equation with a Morse potential [6, Section 5.2]). Here the factorisation is\nincidentally provided by the original Dirac system; see the discussion in Appendix B.\nThe key observation is contained in the following result.\nTheorem 2.\nj \u2208 IN + 1 by\n\nLet \u03ba \u2265 0. Let v1 (t, \u03ba) := e\u2212e\n\n\u2212t\n\n\u2212\u03bat\n\n, and define vj recursively for\n\nvj+1 (t, \u03ba) := (\u03ba + j \u2212 e\u2212t )vj (t) \u2212 vj\u2032 (t)\n\n(t \u2208 IR).\n\nThen vj ( * , \u03ba) is a nontrivial solution of\n\nv \u2032\u2032 = (e\u22122t \u2212 (2\u03ba + 2j \u2212 1)e\u2212t + \u03ba2 ) v,\n\n(5)\n\nand it has the asymptotic properties\nlim vj (t, \u03ba) = 0,\n\nt\u2192\u221e\n\nvj\u2032 (t, \u03ba)\n= \u2212\u03ba,\nlim\nt\u2192\u221e vj (t, \u03ba)\n\nand\n\nvj\u2032 (t, \u03ba) t\nlim\ne =1\nt\u2192\u2212\u221e vj (t, \u03ba)\n\n(j \u2208 IN).\n\nThe proof can be done by induction with respect to j. The fact that vj is a solution of\n(5) is readily verified by differentiating twice. The asymptotic properties are obvious\nfor\nv1\u2032 (t, \u03ba)\n= e\u2212t \u2212 \u03ba.\nv1 (t, \u03ba)\n5\n\n\fNow assume that j \u2208 IN is such that the assertion is true.

Corollary 3 specifies the asymptotic behaviour of the relevant angle functions\nmod \u03c0; a study of the zeros of vj reveals their global behaviour as shown in Lemma 2\nbelow. Theorem 1 then follows in view of\np\n\u03b8(\u033a, \u2212 2kj \u2212 j 2 ) = \u03c6j (log \u033a, k \u2212 j)\n(\u033a > 0, k > 0, j \u2208 IN, j < k),\nwhere (with arctan 0 = 0)\n\n\u03c6j ( * , \u03ba) := arctan(\n\nvj ( * , \u03ba) p\n2\u03baj + j 2 ) + \u03c0.\nvj+1 ( * , \u03ba)\n\nLemma 2.\nLet \u03ba \u2265 0.

The associated angle\nfunction \u03c6j satisfies\nlim \u03c6j (t, \u03ba) = \u03c0\nt\u2192\u2212\u221e\n\nand\np\nlim \u03c6j (t, \u03ba) = \u03b8\u2212 (\u2212 2\u03baj + j 2 , \u03ba + j) \u2212 (j \u2212 1)\u03c0\n\nt\u2192\u221e\n\n(j \u2208 IN).\n\nProof. A look at the direction field of (3) with k = \u03ba + j shows that \u03c6j ( * , \u03ba), being\nthe unstable solution at both \u00b1\u221e, is monotone decreasing. v1 ( * , \u03ba) has no zeros, so\n\u03c61 ( * , \u03ba) has no zeros mod \u03c0, and the assertion follows for j = 1.\nTo conclude the proof by induction, assume now that j \u2208 IN is such that the assertion is true. Then \u03c6j ( * , \u03ba) \u2212 \u03c0/2 has exactly j zeros mod \u03c0, so vj+1 ( * , \u03ba) has\nexactly j zeros. Since the vj+1 ( * , \u03ba) is a non-trivial solution of a second-order equa\u2032\ntion, vj+1\n( * , \u03ba) does not vanish at zeros of vj+1 ( * , \u03ba). Consequently, vj+1 ( * , \u03ba) and\nvj+2 ( * , \u03ba) have no common zeros.\np Hence \u03c6j+1 ( * , \u03ba) has exactly j zeros mod \u03c0, and\ntherefore must converge to \u03b8\u2212 (\u2212 2\u03baj + j 2 , \u03ba + j) \u2212 (j \u2212 1)\u03c0 as t \u2192 \u221e.\nAppendix\nA.

Dirac systems and the factorisation method\nKnown to students of quantum mechanics as a trick to treat the Schr\u00f6dinger equation\nfor the harmonic oscillator, the factorisation method is in fact a tool of much wider\nscope for studying second-order differential equations (see the extensive discussion in\n[6]). It is based on the close link between the eigenvalue equations\nA\u2217 Au = \u03bbu\n\nand\n\nAA\u2217 v = \u03bbv,\n\nwhere A is typically a first-order differential operator: a solution u of the first equation\ngives rise to a solution v = Au of the second.\nHere we remark on how this method can serve to solve eigenvalue equations for\ncertain one-dimensional Dirac operators, which in turn represent a factorisation of the\nSturm-Liouville operators arising as their formal squares.\nStarting from a Dirac system (6), or equivalently\nu\u20321 = \u2212lu1 + (m \u2212 q)u2 ,\nu\u20322 = (m + q)u1 + lu2 ,\n\nwith absolutely continuous coefficients l, m, q, we find that u1 and u2 satisfy the\nsecond-order equations\nu\u2032\u20321 = (m2 \u2212 q 2 + l2 \u2212 l\u2032 )u1 + (m\u2032 \u2212 q \u2032 )u2 ,\n\nu\u2032\u20322 = (m2 \u2212 q 2 + l2 + l\u2032 )u2 + (m\u2032 + q \u2032 )u1 .\n8\n\n\fThis ordinary differential equation system decouples if m and q are constant. If we\nassume this in the following and set c := m \u2212 q, d := m + q and a := cd, we are\ndealing with the Dirac system\nu\u20321 = \u2212lu1 + cu2\nu\u20322 = du1 + lu2\nand corresponding second-order equations\nu\u2032\u20321 = (a + l2 \u2212 l\u2032 )u1 ,\nu\u2032\u20322\n\n2\n\n(7)\n\n\u2032\n\n= (a + l + l )u2 .\n\n(8)\n\nThese two Sturm-Liouville equations differ only in the sign of l\u2032 . Hence we can construct\na chain of interlocking equation systems, along with special solutions, in the following\nway.\nTheorem 3.\nLet (an )n\u2208IN be a sequence of real numbers with a1 = 0, and let\n(ln )n\u2208IN be a sequence of real-valued absolutely continuous functions on I such that\n2\n\u2032\nln+1\n+ ln+1\n+ an+1 = ln2 \u2212 ln\u2032 + an\n\nLet v1 (x) := exp\n\nRx\n\n(n \u2208 IN).\n\nl1 (x \u2208 I), and define recursively for n \u2208 IN + 1\n\u2032\nvn := ln vn\u22121 \u2212 vn\u22121\n.\n\nThen vn is a solution of (7) with a = an , l = ln , and of (8) with a = an+1 , l = ln+1 .\nFurthermore, for n \u2208 IN + 1 and arbitrary dn \u2208 IR \\ {0},\nu :=\n\n\u0012\n\n\u2212 d1n vn\nvn\u22121\n\n\u0013\n\nis a solution of the Dirac system\nu\u20321 = \u2212ln u1 + (an /dn )u2\nu\u20322 = dn u1 + ln u2 .\n\n(9)\n\nProof.\nBecause of a1 = 0, the first equation of the Dirac system (9) with n = 1\ndecouples from the second and can easily be solved to obtain the formula for v1 . As the\nfirst component of a solution of this Dirac system, v1 satisfies equation (7) with l = l1 ,\na = a1 . In view of the assumptions on the coefficients ln , this equation is the same as\n(8) with l = 2, a = a2 , the Sturm-Liouville equation satisfied by the second component\nof a solution of the Dirac system for n = 2. The corresponding first component of this\nsolution can easily be calculated from the second equation of the Dirac system. It will\n9\n\n\fdepend on d2 , but note that this dependence can be eliminated by normalisation as far\nas obtaining a solution v2 of the Sturm-Liouville equation (7) with l = l2 , a = a2 is\nconcerned.\nThis process is then iterated to find the solutions for n \u2208 {3, 4, . . .}.\nExamples.\n1. The classical application of the factorisation method to the one-dimensional Schr\u00f6dinger\nequation for a quantum-mechanical harmonic oscillator,\n\u2212v \u2032\u2032 (x) + x2 v(x) = \u03bbv(x),\nis captured in the above scheme if we choose ln (x) := x (n \u2208 IN). The hypothesis\nof Theorem 3 is then satisfied with an := \u22122(n \u2212 1) (n \u2208 IN), and we obtain the\nwell-known solutions\nd\nx2\nvn (x) = (\u2212\n+ x)n\u22121 e\u2212 2\ndx\nwith eigenvalues \u03bbn := 2n \u2212 1 (n \u2208 IN).\n2. The case of equation (5) is treated by choosing ln (x) := \u03ba + (n \u2212 1) \u2212 e\u2212x (n \u2208 IN);\n\u2212x\nwe immediately find v1 (x) = e\u2212e +\u03bax and the recursion formula of Theorem 2.\nReferences.\n1.
