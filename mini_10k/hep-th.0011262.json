INTRODUCTION\n\nThe cosmological constant \u039b presents us with at least two intriguing problems. Particle\nphysics models suggest that the natural value for this constant is set by the Planck scale,\nMP \u223c 1018 GeV [we use the reduced Planck mass MP = (8\u03c0G)\u22121/2 ]. The corresponding\nvacuum energy density is \u03c1\u039b \u223c MP4 , which is some 120 orders of magnitude greater than the\nobservational bounds. In supersymmetric theories, one can expect a lower value,\n4\n\u03c1\u039b \u223c \u03b7SU\nSY ,\n\n(1)\n\n> 1 TeV, this is still\nwhere \u03b7SU SY is the supersymmetry breaking scale. However, with \u03b7SU SY \u223c\n60 orders of magnitude too high. Until recently, this discrepancy between the expected and\nobserved values was the only cosmological constant problem. Its solution, many believed, was\nthat something so small could only be zero, due to some unknown symmetry or dynamical\ncancellation.\n\n1\n\n\fThus, it came as a surprise when recent observations [1] provided evidence that the universe is accelerating, rather than decelerating, suggesting a non-zero cosmological constant1 .\nThe observationally suggested values of \u039b correspond to \u03c1\u039b \u223c \u03c1M 0 , where \u03c1M 0 is the present\ndensity of matter. This brings yet another puzzle. It is difficult to understand why we happen to live at the epoch when \u03c1M \u223c \u03c1\u039b . Another statement of the problem is why the time\nwhen \u039b starts dominating the universe nearly coincides with the epoch of galaxy formation,\nt\u039b \u223c tG .\n\n(2)\n\nThis is the so-called cosmic coincidence problem.\nA number of proposed solutions to these problems have recently appeared in the literature\n[4\u20139]. Some of them rely on some form of the anthropic principle, while others do not. To\nour knowlege, the only approach that can explain both puzzles is the one that attributes\nthem to anthropic selection effects. In this approach, the cosmological constant is assumed\nto be a random variable that can take different values in defferent parts of the universe.\nThe purpose of this paper is to give a critical analysis of the proposed approaches, both\nanthropic and otherwise. Our main focus will be on the models with a discrete spectrum of \u039b\nwhich have recently attracted much attention. We shall consider these models in the framework of inflationary cosmology and discuss the calculation of the probability distribution for\n\u03c1\u039b , as well as the observational constraints on the model parameters.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Section II we review the motivation for considering\n\u039b as a random variable. In Section III we discuss models where \u039b is a discrete variable, in\nparticular the models where there is a four-form contribution to the cosmological constant,\nwhich may relax to a small value through nucleation of branes. In Section IV we analyze\nthe cosmology of such models. In Section V we consider the possibility of coincident brane\nnucleation. In Section VI we discuss models where the cosmological constant is a continuous\nvariable. In Section VII we consider the possibility of a slowly varying four-form field in\ntheories with extra dimensions. In Section VIII we review some non-anthropic approaches\nto the problem. In Section IX we consider models where the time coincidence is explained\nby assuming that the primordial density contrast Q = \u03b4\u03c1/\u03c1 (and not necessarily \u039b) is a\nrandom variable. Our conclusions are summarized in Section X.\nII. \u039b AS A RANDOM VARIABLE\n\nNot all values of \u039b are consistent with the existence of conscious observers. This observation was made by Barrow and Tipler [10] (see also [11]), but the first quantitative analysis is\ndue to Weinberg [12]. In a spatially flat universe with a cosmological constant, gravitational\n\n1 The\n\nsurprise, however, was not total. In Ref. [2] (well before the supernova data [1] would give\nthe first observational evidence in this direction) it was noted that anthropic selection effects would\n< 10, and that \"the actual value is likely to\nplace the cosmological constant in the range \u03c1\u039b /\u03c1M 0 \u223c\nbe comparable to this upper bound.\" For a flat universe this implies \u03a9\u039b \u223c 0.9, not far from the\nobserved value and certainly compatible with it, within the accuracy of the prediction. Similar\npredictions where made in [3] at about the same time.\n\n2\n\n\fclustering effectively stops at t \u223c t\u039b . At later times, the vacuum energy dominates and the\nuniverse enters a de Sitter stage of exponential expansion. An anthropic bound on \u03c1\u039b can be\nobtained by requiring that it does not dominate before the redshift zmax when the earliest\ngalaxies are formed. Weinberg took zmax \u223c 4 and obtained\n< 100\u03c1\n\u03c1\u039b \u223c\nM 0.\n\n(3)\n\ndP(\u03c1\u039b ) = P\u2217 (\u03c1\u039b )\u03bd(\u03c1\u039b )d\u03c1\u039b .\n\n(4)\n\nThis is a dramatic improvement over Eq.(1), but it still falls short of the observational bound\nby a factor of about 30.\nThe anthropic bound (3) specifies the value of \u03c1\u039b which makes galaxy formation barely\npossible. However, as it was pointed out in [2,3], the observers are where the galaxies are,\nand thus most of the observers will detect not these marginal values, but rather the values\nthat maximize the number of galaxies. More precisely, the probability distribution for \u03c1\u039b\ncan be written as\nHere, P\u2217 (\u03c1\u039b )d\u03c1\u039b is the a priori distribution, which is proportional to the volume of those\nparts of the universe where \u03c1\u039b takes values in the interval d\u03c1\u039b , and \u03bd(\u03c1\u039b ) is the average\nnumber of galaxies that form per unit volume with a given value of \u03c1\u039b . According to the\n\"principle of mediocrity\", which assumes that we are typical observers, Eq. (4) gives the\nprobability distribution for us to observe a given value of \u03c1\u039b . The calculation of \u03bd(\u03c1\u039b ) is\na standard astrophysical problem; it can be done, for example, using the Press-Schechter\nformalism [13]. The a priori distribution P\u2217 (\u03c1\u039b ) should be determined from the theory of\ninitial conditions, e.g., from an inflationary model.\nMartel, Shapiro and Weinberg [14] (see also [15]) presented a detailed calculation of\ndP(\u03c1\u039b ) assuming a flat a priori distribution,\nP\u2217 (\u03c1\u039b ) = const\n\n(5)\n\nin the range of interest (3). They found that the peak of the resulting probability distribution\nis close to the observationally suggested values of \u03c1\u039b . The cosmic time coincidence is easy to\nunderstand in this approach [16,17] if one notes that regions of the universe where t\u039b \u226a tG\ndo not form any galaxies at all, whereas regious where t\u039b \u226b tG are suppressed by \"phase\nspace\", since they correspond to a very tiny range of \u039b. It was shown in Ref. [16] that the\nprobability distribution for tG /t\u039b is peaked at tG /t\u039b \u2248 1.5, and thus most observers will find\nthemselves in galaxies formed at tG \u223c t\u039b .\nThis anthropic solution to the cosmological constant problems is incomplete without a\nparticle physics model that would allow \u039b to take different values and without a theory\nof initial conditions, such as an inflationary cosmological model, that would allow one to\ncalculate the a priori distribution P\u2217 (\u03c1\u039b ).\nOne possibility is to consider models in which the role of the vacuum energy is played\nby a slowly varying potential V (\u03c6) of some scalar field \u03c6, which is very weakly coupled to\nordinary matter. The values of \u03c6 are randomized by quantum fluctuations during inflation,\nand analysis shows that the resulting a priori distribution is indeed flat for a wide class\nof potentials [4,18]. The main challenge one has to face in this approach is to justify the\nexceedingly flat potential V (\u03c6) required by the model. We shall comment on this issue\nin Section VI. Before that, we shall consider an alternative possibility which has recently\nattracted much attention. This is provided by models with a discrete spectrum of \u03c1\u039b .\n3\n\n\fIII. MODELS WITH A DISCRETE SPECTRUM OF \u039b\n\nThe first model of this type was suggested in an early paper by Abbott [19] as an attempt\nto solve the old cosmological constant problem. He considered a self-interacting scalar field\n\u03c6 with a \"washboard\" potential V (\u03c6) of the form illustrated in Fig.1. The potential has\nlocal minima at \u03c6n = n\u03b7 with n = 0, \u00b11, \u00b12, ... , separated from one another by barriers.\nThe vacuum at \u03c6 = \u03c6n has energy density\n\u03c1\u039bn = n\u01eb + const\n\n(6)\n\nand can decay through bubble nucleation to the vacuum at \u03c6n\u22121 .\n\nVH\u03a6L\n\nFIG. 1. The washboard potential.\n\nThe nucleation rate \u0393n\u2193 per unit spacetime volume is given by\n\u0393n\u2193 = An e\u2212Bn ,\n\n(7)\n\nwhere Bn is the action of the Coleman - de Luccia instanton [20] and the meaning of the\nsubscript \u2193 will become clear shortly. The bubble radius at nucleation Rn is bounded by\n0 < Rn < Hn\u22121 , where\nHn2 =\n\n\u03c1n\n3MP2\n\n(8)\n\nis the square of the expansion rate of de Sitter space filled with the vacuum \u03c6n .

The general expression is somewhat cumbersome and we shall only consider the limiting\ncases of interest.

The total vacuum energy\ndensity is given by\n\u03c1\u039b = \u03c1bare + F 2 /2,\n\n(19)\n\nwhere \u03c1bare < 0 is the 'bare' cosmological constant at F = 0. The change of the field strength\nacross the brane is\n\u2206F = \u00b1q,\n\n(20)\n\nwhere q = const is fixed by the model. The four-form model has recently attracted much\nattention because four-form fields with appropriate couplings to branes naturally arise in\nthe context of M-theory. In this case the brane tension is [5,6]\n\u221a\n\u03c3 = qMP / 2,\n(21)\nand the effective thickness of the branes is \u03b4 \u223c MP\u22121 , so that the thin wall approximation is\njustified.\nAt present we should have |F | \u2248 (\u22122\u03c1bare )1/2 , so that the bare cosmological constant is\nalmost neutralized. Then, in the range of interest, the spectrum of \u03c1\u039b is nearly equidistant,\nwith a separation\n\u2206\u03c1\u039b \u2261 \u01eb \u2248 (\u22122\u03c1bare )1/2 q,\n\n(22)\n\nand the model is very similar to the Abbott's \"washboard\" model. We expect\n> (1T eV )4 ,\n|\u03c1bare | \u223c\n\n(23)\n\n< 10\u221290 M 2 and\nand it follows from Eq.(15) that q \u223c\nP\n< (10\u22123 eV )3 ,\n\u03c3\u223c\n\n(24)\n\nwhere we have used the relation (21) between \u03c3 and q. Such small values of q and \u03c3\nmay appear problematic, but in a recent paper [6] Feng, March-Russell, Sethi and Wilczek\n(FMSW) have argued that they can naturally arise due to non-perturbative effects in Mtheory. With \u03c3 and H satisfying the bounds (24) and (16), the condition of negligible brane\ngravity (12) is also satisfied, and thus Eqs.(9),(10) can be used.\nWith the aid of Eqs.(21)-(24) it can be easily verified that the flat space bounce action\n(9) is bounded by [6]\n< 102 .\nB (f lat) \u223c\n\n(25)\n\nThis inequality is saturated for \u03c1bare \u223c (1 TeV)4 and\n\u01eb1/4 \u223c \u03c3 1/3 \u223c 10\u22123 eV.\n6\n\n(26)\n\n\f< 1 and brane nucleation is\nIf \u03c3 and \u01eb significantly differ from these borderline values, then B \u223c\nunsuppressed.

They assume that several four-forms Fi are present, so that Eq.(19) is replaced by\n\u03c1\u039b = \u03c1bare +\n\n1X 2\nF .\n2 i i\n\n(29)\n\nThe corresponding \"charges\" qi are not assumed to be very small, but BP have shown that\nwith multiple four-forms the spectrum of the allowed values of \u03c1\u039b can be sufficiently dense\nto satisfy the condition (15) in the range of interest. However, the situation here is quite\ndifferent from that in the FMSW model. As pointed out by the authors themselves, and\nfurther emphasized by Banks, Dine and Motl [26], the vacua with nearby values of \u03c1\u039b have\nvery different values of Fi and are expected to have very different physical properties. There\nis no reason to expect the a priori probabilities for these vacua to be similar. Moreover,\nthe low energy physics in different vacua is likely to be different, so the process of galaxy\nformation and the types of life that can evolve will also differ. It appears therefore that the\nanthropic approach to solving the cosmological constant problems cannot be applied to this\ncase [26].\nIV. COSMOLOGY OF THE FOUR-FORM MODELS\nA. A priori distribution\n\nWe shall now discuss the four-form models with brane nucleation in the context of inflationary cosmology. The energy density of the universe during inflation can be expressed\nas\n\u03c1n (\u03c7) = U(\u03c7) + \u03c1\u039bn ,\n\n(30)\n\nwhere U(\u03c7) is the potential of the inflaton field \u03c7, \u03c1\u039bn is the cosmological constant contribution (19), and index n labels the vacuum energies corresponding to different values of the\nfour-form field F . [The inflaton potential is generally F -dependent and has different forms\nUn (\u03c7) in defferent vacua [5,26]. Here we shall disregard this difference, assuming that the\nvariation of U(\u03c7) is negligible in the narrow anthropic range of \u03c1\u039b that will be of interest to\nus.] The minimum of U(\u03c7) is assumed to be at Umin = 0. The spacetime during inflation is\nlocally approximately de Sitter,\n7\n\n\fds2 = dt2 \u2212 e2Hn t dx2 ,\n\n(31)\n\nwith Hn (\u03c7) given by Eq.(8).\nA remarkable feature of inflation, which will play an important role in our discussion here,\nis that generically inflation never ends completely in the entire universe. The evolution of\nthe inflaton field \u03c7 is influenced by quantum fluctuations, and as a result thermalization\ndoes not occur simultaneously in different parts of the universe. In most of the models, one\nfinds that at any time there are parts of the universe that are still inflating and that the\ntotal volume of inflating regions is growing with time [27,28]. This picture is often referred\nto as stochastic, or eternal, inflation.\n\nVH\u03a7L\n\n\u00c8\n\n\u00c8\n\n\u03a7q\n\n\u03a7*\n\nFIG. 2. Inflaton potential\n\nThe full range of the field \u03c7 can be divided into the \"diffusion\", slow-roll, and thermal< \u03c7 , the inflaton dynamics\nization parts, as illustrated in Fig. 2. In the diffusion range, \u03c7 \u223c\nq\nis dominated by quantum fluctuations. It is this regime that is responsible for the eternal\n< \u03c7 < \u03c7 , the inflaton rolls down its potennature of inflation. In the slow-roll regime, \u03c7q \u223c\n\u223c \u2217\ntial. As it reaches the thermalization point \u03c7\u2217 , it starts oscillating about the minimum of\nthe potential, and its energy gets thermalized. The hypersurfaces \u03c7 = \u03c7\u2217 are therefore the\nboundaries between inflating and thermalized regions of spacetime. These surfaces play the\nrole of the big bang for the corresponding thermalized regions. There is typically an infinite\nnumber of such surfaces, each of them having an infinite volume. (For a discussion of the\nspacetime structure of inflationary universe see, e.g., [29].)\nAs the inflaton \u03c7 fluctuates, rolls down its potential, and eventually thermalizes its\nenergy, spherical branes nucleate at the rates (7),(13) changing the local values of the fourform field F . All possible values of \u03c1\u039bn will be taken on each infinite thermalization surface\n8\n\n\f\u03a3\u2217 , and the a priori probability P\u2217n can be defined as the fraction of the volume of \u03a3\u2217\noccupied by regions with vacuum energy density \u03c1\u039bn . [The volume fraction on an infinite\nhypersurface can be defined by calculating this fraction in a sphere of geodesic radius R and\ntaking the limit R \u2192 \u221e.]\nBrane nucleation can both decrease and increase the value of \u03c1\u039bn ; the corresponding\nnucleation rates are related by Eq.(13). For \u039b-lowering events, the bubble radius is initially\nsmaller than the horizon Hn\u22121 and then grows in the comoving coordinates, while for \u039b-raising\nevents the radius is initially larger than the horizon and then decreases in the comoving\ncoordinates. In both cases, with an appropriate definition of the nucleation time, the radius\nof the bubble nucleated at t = 0 asymptotically approaches Hn\u22121 eHn t [30]. This means that\nthe region affected by each nucleation event is a sphere of initial radius Hn\u22121 . For a comoving\nobserver in vacuum n, the probabilities per unit time to witness a \u039b-raising or lowering event\nare\n\u03ban\u2191 = \u0393n\u2191\n\n4\u03c0 \u22123\nH ,\n3 n\n\n(32)\n\n\u03ban\u2193 = \u0393n\u2193\n\n4\u03c0 \u22123\nH .\n3 n\n\n(33)\n\nIt follows from (13) that these probabilities are related by\n\u03ba(n\u22121)\u2191 = \u03ban\u2193 (fn\u22121 /fn ),\n\n(34)\n\nwhere\nfn =\n\nHn\u22123 exp\n\n24\u03c0 2 MP4\n\u2212\n\u03c1n\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(35)\n\nConsider an ensemble of comoving observers and let pn (t) be the fraction of observers\nin the n-th vacuum, where t is the proper time along the observers' world lines. The time\nevolution of pn is described by the equations\ndpn /dt = \u2212(\u03ban\u2191 + \u03ban\u2193 )pn + \u03ba(n\u22121)\u2191 pn\u22121 + \u03ba(n+1)\u2193 pn+1 .\n\n(36)\n\nLet us assume for a moment that the inflaton potential remains unchanged,\nU(\u03c7) = const,\n\n(37)\n\nso that \u03ban\u2191 and \u03ban\u2193 do not change with time. Then the solutions of (36) approach the\nstationary distribution\npn \u221d\n\nfn\u22121\n\n\u221d\n\nHn3\n\n24\u03c0 2 MP4\nexp\n\u03c1n\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(38)\n\nWe shall be mostly interested in the probability distribution in the anthropic range (3),\nwhere \u03c1\u039bn can be approximated by (6) with \u01eb from Eq.(22), and Eq.(38) takes the form\n8\u03c0 2 \u01eb\nn .\npn \u221d exp \u2212\n3H 4\n!\n\n9\n\n(39)\n\n\fIf inflation is well above the electroweak scale, H \u226b 10\u22123 eV, then the distribution (39) is\nnearly flat in the anthropic range,\npn \u2248 const.\n\n(40)\n\nThe assumption (37) may or may not be a good approximation, depending on the shape\nof the potential U(\u03c7). A simple example of a model where this approximation is adequate\nis a \"new inflation\" type model with a very flat potential in the diffusion range near the\nmaximum of U(\u03c7) and a relatively steep decline to the minimum in the slow roll range. The\ndistribution (38) is established during the very long diffusion period, and then it does not\nchange much during the slow roll period if the duration of the slow roll is shorter than the\ncharacteristic bubble nucleation time. Here we shall assume that the approximation (37) is\njustified.\nCan the distribution (38) be identified with the a priori probability distribution P\u2217n ?\nThe answer is \"Yes, but only in a restricted class of models\". An ensemble of comoving\nobservers gives a comoving-volume distribution for \u03c1\u039bn , which does not account for the fact\nthat regions with different values of \u03c1\u039bn expand at different rates. The condition for this\neffect to be negligible is that brane nucleations should reshuffle the values of \u03c1\u039bn between\ndifferent regions on a timescale \u03c4B which is much shorter than the time \u03c4H it takes for the\ndifferential expansion rate to significantly modify the distribution,\n\u03c4B \u226a \u03c4H .\n\n(41)\n\nAs we noted in Section II, the probabilities of upward and downward jumps in \u03c1\u039b should\nbe nearly equal, except perhaps in the borderline case (17). This means that the evolution\nof \u03c1\u039b can be pictured as a random walk with steps taken on a timescale \u03c4 \u223c \u03ba\u22121 \u223c H 3 \u0393\u22121 .\nThe anthropic range (3) comprises N \u223c 102 \u03c1M 0 /\u01eb steps, and thus\n2\n\n3 \u22121\n\n\u03c4B \u223c N H \u0393\n\n\u223c 10\n\n4\n\n\u0012\n\n\u03c1M 0\n\u01eb\n\n\u00132\n\nH3 B\ne ,\n\u03c3 2 R02\n\n(42)\n\nwhere we have used Eqs.(7) and (11). [In this discussion we have dropped the subscripts \u2191\nand \u2193, since the upward and downward nucleation rates are nearly equal, and the subscript\nn since Hn is nearly constant in the anthropic range.]\nThe variation of the expansion rate in the anthropic range of \u03c1\u039b is\n\u03b4H \u223c\n\nN\u01eb\n,\nMP2 H\n\n(43)\n\nand the time \u03c4H can be estimated as\n\u03c4H \u223c 1/\u03b4H \u223c 10\u22122 MP2 H/\u03c1M 0 .\n\n(44)\n\nThe condition \u03c4B \u226a \u03c4H can now be expressed as\nB\n\ne \u226a\n\n2 2\n2 2\n\u22126 \u01eb \u03c3 MP R0\n.\n10\nH 2\u03c13M 0\n\nParameter values satisfying this condition can be readily found.\n10\n\n(45)\n\n\fWhat happens in the opposite limit, when \u03c4B \u226b \u03c4H ? In this case the differential expansion is important and the probabilities for faster expanding regions with higher values\nof \u03c1\u039b are strongly enhanced. The predicted values of \u03c1\u039b should therefore be significantly\nhigher than those obtained with a flat a priori distribution. Martel et.al. [14] have found\nthat in the latter case the probability distribution is peaked at \u03c1\u039b = 0, the width of the peak\nbeing somewhat broader than the observationally suggested value. Models with \u03c4B \u226b \u03c4H\nwill have the peak displaced towards higher values of \u03c1\u039b and are therefore unlikely to give\na good agreement with observations. A quantitative analysis of probability distributions\nin such models can be given by a relatively straightforward generalization of the formalism\ndeveloped in Ref. [30].\nWe note finally that in models with borderline values of parameters (17) the a priori\ndistribution (39) can significantly deviate from flatness, with smaller values of \u03c1\u039b being\nfavored. This would displace the peak of the resulting distribution to negative values of \u03c1\u039b\nand if anything would make the observational situation even worse.\nB. Observational constraints\n\nModels of the type we are discussing here suggest that we live in a bubble surrounded by\nan expanding brane. The values of \u03c1\u039b inside and outside the brane are different. Let us first\nassume that the visible universe is contained within a single bubble. This means that the\nbrane surrounding our bubble nucleated before the presently observable universe crossed the\nhorizon during inflation. For this situation to be typical, the brane nucleation rates should\nbe rather low, both during inflation and at present. This requires that the corresponding\nbounce actions should be large, B \u226b 1. In M-theory motivated models this is possible only\nfor the borderline values of the parameters,\nH \u223c \u01eb1/4 \u223c \u03c3 1/3 \u223c 10\u22123 eV.\n\n(46)\n\nHowever, as we discussed at the end of Section IV.A, these values seem to be disfavoured\nby observations.\nThe brane nucleation rate at present is given by Eq.(7) with B and A from Eqs.(9),(11).\nIn order to have no brane nucleations in the observable universe in a Hubble time, we have\nto require that\n< 1,\n\u0393t40 \u223c\n\n(47)\n\nwhere t0 is the present cosmic time. For the parameter values (46), A \u223c (10\u22123 eV)4 and\n< 10\u2212116 , or\nEq.(47) gives exp(\u2212B (f lat) ) \u223c\n> 270.\nB (f lat) \u223c\n\n(48)\n\nThis is only marginally consistent with the bound (25)\nThe brane nucleation rate during inflation is determined by the smaller of the two bounce\nactions (9),(10). Eq.(46) tells us that in models based on M-theory brane nucleation can be\nsuppressed only if the expansion rate during inflation is H \u223c 10\u22123 eV. Let N \u223c 30 be the\nnumber of e-foldings from the time when the comoving region corresponding to the presently\n11\n\n\fobservable universe crossed the horizon to the end of inflation. Then the size of this region\nat the end of inflation is H \u22121 eN . In order to have no brane nucleations in this region during\nthis whole period, we have to require\n< 1.\n\u0393H \u22124e3N \u223c\n\n(49)\n\n> 90, again marginally consistent with (25),(27).\nFor the parameter values (46) this gives B \u223c\nWe thus see that M-theory based four-form models could in principle provide a solution\nto the cosmological constant problems, but only if inflation is at a TeV scale and \u03c3 and \u01eb\nare in the tight corner of the parameter space (46). With such values of the parameters, the\ncondition (45) can be (marginally) satisfied. However, from (14 we then find a significant bias\ntowards \u039b-lowering nucleation events, which would shift the a priori distribution (39) towards\nlower \u039b. This would result in a prediction near the lower anthropic bound \u03c1\u039b \u223c \u2212\u03c1M 0 . The\nbias towards \u039b-lowering events might be compensated to some extent by the differential\nexpansion rate, which adds relative volume to regions with high \u039b. However, both effects are\nexponential, and unless there is a conspiracy in the parameters of the model, the differential\nexpansion is likely to be either insignificant or dominant. In the latter case, the a priori\ndistribution would be biased towards large \u039b, and it would be likely to predict a cosmological\nconstant much larger than observed. In summary, it seems difficult to obtain a flat a priori\ndistribution even in the range (46). Of course, the possibility cannot be excluded with our\norder of magnitude estimates, and there may still be a small viable region of parameter space\nin this borderline range. We note also that for models unrelated to M-theory the allowed\nparameter space is much larger.\nSuppose now that the visible universe contains more than one bubble. This would\n> \u01eb/\u03c1\ngenerally result in microwave background anisotropies of amplitude \u03b4T /T \u223c\nM 0 , so to\navoid conflict with observations we have to require\n< 10\u22125 \u03c1\n\u01eb\u223c\nM 0.\n\n(50)\n\nThis takes us far from the borderline values (46), and thus the multiple bubble scenario\ncannot be realized in M-theory based models. For non-M-theory models, a suitable set of\nparameters can be easily found by choosing \u03c3 and H sufficiently large, while keeping \u01eb under\nthe bound (50).\nThe multiple bubble scenario is feasible only if branes have negligible interaction with\nordinary matter. Otherwise we would see fireworks along the bubble boundaries, where the\nbranes hit the stars and where they hit one another. However, the gravitational impact\nof the branes cannot be avoided. An observer outside an expanding spherical bubble does\nnot experience any gravitational force until he is hit by the brane. While the brane passes\nthrough the observer, the part of his body inside the brane will experience an acceleration\na = GM/R2 relative to the part of the body still outside the brane. Here, M = (4\u03c0/3)\u01ebR3\nand R is the bubble radius at the moment of impact. With R \u223c t0 and \u01eb satisfying (50), we\n\u221212\n<\nhave a \u223c G\u01ebt0 \u223c (\u01eb/\u03c1M 0 )t\u22121\ncm/s2 . The relative speed developed during the passage\n0 \u223c 10\n< 10\u221220 cm/s, and the corresponding displacement is much smaller\ntime \u2206t \u223c 10\u22128 s is \u2206v \u223c\nthan the inter-atomic distance. For a brane passing through a Sun-like star, \u2206t \u223c 10 s and\nthe displacement is still smaller than the atomic scale. Thus, if a brane is to sweep through\nthe Solar system, its only effect would be to set up imperceptible vibrations in the objects\nit leaves behind.\n12\n\n\fWhat happens if B < 1, so that brane nucleation is completely unsuppressed? The main\ndanger here is that the vacuum energy will decay so fast that it will drop significantly in\nless than a Hubble time. This can be countered by choosing \u01eb so small that the change in\n\u03c1\u039b is negligible even after nucleation of a large number of bubbles. This case, however, is\nalmost indistinguishable from that of a scalar field with a very flat potential, which will be\ndiscussed in Section VI.\nC. No empty universe problem\n\nHere we shall comment on the so called empty universe problem which was encountered\nin all earlier work on discrete \u039b models [31,19,25,5,6,9,26]. The scenario these authors had\nin mind is that the universe starts with a large cosmological constant and relaxes, within\nthe available cosmic time, to a metastable vacuum with an observationally acceptable value\nof \u039b. The problem is that, in order to make the present vacuum sufficiently stable, the\nbrane nucleation has to be strongly suppressed. One then finds that the time it takes the\nuniverse to evolve to the low-energy vacuum is so large that, by the time when the process\nis complete, any matter that the universe initially had gets diluted to an extremely low\ndensity. So one ends up with an empty universe dominated by the cosmological constant.\nA number of solutions to this problem have been proposed. FMSW suggested [6] that the\nnucleation rate of multiple coincident branes may be enhanced due to the increased density\nof states. They argued that this would lead to a rapid descent of the vacuum energy towards\nlower values. To ensure the long lifetime of the present vacuum, they argued that this rate\nenhancement may not apply to the vacuum with the lowest positive value of \u03c1\u039b . Bousso\nand Polchinski [5], who considered brane nucleation with large jumps in \u03c1\u039b , suggested that\nthe penultimate vacuum could have a high energy density. The inflaton field would then be\nexcited to high values of its potential by quantum fluctuations. When the ultimate brane\nnucleates, the inflaton rolls down the potential thermalizing its energy and providing a high\ndensity of matter. Alternatively, they suggested that the nucleation of the ultimate bubble,\nwhich in their model is accompanied by a large change in the four-form field F , can be\naccompanied by a large modification of the inflaton potential. As a result the inflaton will\nbe displaced from the minimum of the potential, even if it was at the minimum prior to the\nbubble nucleation.\nIn our view, the empty universe problem is not a real problem, and the attempts to\nsolve it seem therefore unnecessary. The problem disappears when the eternal nature of\ninflation is taken into account. As the inflaton fluctuates back and forth in the quantum\ndiffusion regime, branes are constantly being nucleated and all possible values of \u03c1\u039b are\nreached. The slow rate of brane nucleation is not a problem, since an unlimited amount of\ntime is available. Thermalization of the inflaton energy occurs at different times in different\nparts of the universe, and each region inherits the local value of \u03c1\u039b . Each possible value\nis represented in the thermalized regions of the universe. We are interested only in those\nregions where \u03c1\u039b is in the anthropic range (3), because that's where all the galaxies are.\n\n13\n\n\fV. MULTIPLE BRANE NUCLEATION\n\nUp till now we assumed that brane nucleations change the four-form field F by a single\nunit, Eq.(20). However, nucleation of multiple coincident branes is also possible. For k\ncoincident branes there is a U(k) super Yang-Mills (SYM) living on the world-volume. In\nFMSW [6] it was argued that the nucleation of coincident branes would be enhanced by a\nlarge degeneracy factor\nD = eS ,\nwhere S is the \"entropy\" of the SYM fields. For 2-branes arising from the wrapping of a\n4D-brane on a degenerating 2-cycle, FMSW estimated this entropy as\nS \u223c k \u03b2 R2 T 2 .\n\n(51)\n\nHere k \u03b2 counts the effective number of degrees of freedom which live on the brane. There are\ntheoretical uncertainties in the exponent \u03b2, but FMSW suggest that it should be between\n2 and 3/2. R is the radius of the Coleman-De Luccia instanton, which coincides with the\nsize of the \"bubble\" at the time of nucleation, and T is some effective temperature. FMSW\nconsidered two different candidates for the effective temperature. One of them was the\neffective ambient de Sitter temperature [32] T0 before brane nucleation, and the other was\nthe geometric mean of T0 and the effective temperature TI of the new de Sitter space inside\nthe nucleated brane T \u223c (TI T0 )1/2 .\nIt is easy to understand, however, that the relevant effective temperature corresponding\nto the Coleman-De Luccia (CdL) instanton is in fact none of the above, but simply the\neffective de Sitter temperature of the 2+1 dimensional world-volume of the brane\nT =\n\n1\n.\n2\u03c0R\n\n(52)\n\nThis is the temperature experienced by the degrees of freedom living in the wall (and it is\nin fact higher than T0 and TI ). The prefactor D is a determinant arising from Gaussian\nintegration of perturbations around the instanton solution, including all light degrees of\nfreedom. Such determinants where discussed in some detail in [23]. A scalar field of mass\nm living on the 2+1 dimensional world-volume gives a contribution\n\u2032\n\nDs = e\u03b6 (0)/2\n\n(53)\n\nwhere \u03b6(z) is the Zeta function of the scalar fluctuation operator on the 3-sphere. Its\nderivative at the origin is given by [23]:\n\u2032\n\n\u03b6 (0) =\n\n2\u03b6R\u2032 (\u22122)\n\n2\n\u2212 y ln(sin \u03c0y) + 2\n\u03c0\n2\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u03c0y\n\nx ln(sin x)dx,\n\n(54)\n\nwhere y 2 = 1 \u2212 m2 R2 and \u03b6R is the usual Riemann Zeta function (this expression is valid\nfor light fields, with mR < 1).\nFor instance, the contribution of a conformally coupled scalar field can be obtained by\ntaking m2 = (3/4)R\u22122, which gives\n\u03b6 \u2032(0) = 2\u03b6R\u2032 (\u22122) \u2212\n\n1\n7\nln 2 + 2 \u03b6R (3) \u2248 \u22120.1276\n4\n8\u03c0\n14\n\n\fHence, the effective degeneracy factor contributed by a conformal scalar field is given by\nDconf. \u2248 e\u2212.0638 \u2248 0.91 < 1.\n\n(55)\n\nThe first thing to note is that this factor is not an enhancement, but a suppression. Hence,\nthe determinant cannot simply be thought of as the exponential of an entropy.\nIn fact, the CdL instanton is not a thermal instanton, but a zero temperatue instanton.\nThermal instantons for brane nucleation are static and have the topology S 2 \u00d7S 1 (rather than\nS 3 ), where the S 2 is the 2D-brane at fixed time and the S 1 is the periodic Euclidean time.\nThermal instantons do in fact exist also in de Sitter space, but they have not received too\nmuch attention because their Euclidean action is always larger than that of the maximally\nsymmetric CdL. For thermal instantons (in flat or in de Sitter space) the determinantal\nprefactor is given by D = e\u2212\u2206F/T , where \u2206F = \u2206E \u2212 T S is the free energy contribution of\nlight degrees of freedom on the brane. Such prefactors have been considered in [33]. The free\nenergy consists of the vacuum energy \u2206E (or Casimir energy on the two-sphere) minus the\nproduct of the temperature times the entropy. While the entropy is always positive, the sign\nof the Casimir contribution is notoriously dependent on the type of field. In fact, for thermal\ninstantons in de Sitter the temperature is always smaller or equal to the inverse of the size\nof the bubble, and hence the sign of the free energy contribution can easily be dominated by\nthe Casimir contribution, which can have either sign. Although as mentioned above the CdL\ninstanton is not thermal, this consideration may help clarify why the prefactor D need not\nrepresent an enhancement. Depending on the field content it may represent a suppression.\nAnother thing to note about (55) is that it is independent of R. Roughly speaking, this\nis consistent with the fact that the effective temperature is T \u221d R\u22121 . In general, however,\nthe degeneracy factor will depend on R and on the mass of the particle. For light minimally\ncoupled scalars, equations (53) and (54) give\n\u2032\n\ne\u03b6R (\u22122)\nDs \u2248 1/2\n\u03c0 mR\n\n(mR \u226a 1).\n\nThere can be a strong enhancement in the nucleation rate if there are very light massless\nscalar fields. In the limit m \u2192 0 the factor goes to infinity. This is because a massless scalar\nhas a normalizable zero mode on the sphere, corresponding to the symmetry \u03c6 \u2192 \u03c6 + const.\nIn this case, the zero mode must be treated as a collective coordinate. The nucleation rate\nis proportional to the range \u03b4\u03c6 of the field \u03c6, because the bubbles can be nucleated with\nany average value of the scalar field with equal probability [23]\n\u2032\n\n\u03b4Ds (m2 = 0) = lim\n[mDs (m)](\u03c0R3 )1/2 \u03b4\u03c6 = e\u03b6R (\u22122) R1/2 \u03b4\u03c6.\n2\nm \u21920\n\nAs we shall discuss in some examples below, some scalars are likely to pick up masses of\norder of the intrinsic curvature of the 2+1 sphere, and for these Ds is also independent of\nthe radius.\nLet us briefly consider the field content on the brane. For k coincident 4D-branes in\nten dimensions, the effective theory is U(k) SYM. This consists of a U(k) gauge field plus\n5(k 2 \u2212 1) scalar degrees of freedom in the adjoint representation of SU(k) plus 5 scalar\nsinglets plus the corresponding fermionic degrees of freedom.\nIf the branes are flat (as in the case when there is no external four-form field), then the\ntheory is supersymmetric and all scalar degrees of freedom are massless. For the case of\n15\n\n\fa single brane, the five scalars represent the goldstone modes of the broken translational\nsymmetry. That is, they correspond to transverse displacements of the brane. For the case\nof two branes, there are 10 such displacements. Five of them correspond to simultaneous\nmotion of both branes. These are the singlets under SU(2). The rest are in the adjoint\nrepresentation, and if they acquire an expectation value they give mass to two of the four\ngauge bosons. For instance, when the two branes move apart, one of the adjoint scalars\nacquires an expectation value and two of the gauge bosons get a mass, breaking the symmetry\nU(2) \u2192 U(1) \u00d7 U(1).\nThe case of interest to us is not a flat brane, but a 4D-brane wrapped on a degenerating\ntwo cycle. The world-wolume of the resulting 2D-brane in 4 Euclidean dimensions is not\nflat either, but forms a 3-sphere of radius R. In this situation, we do not expect the theory\nto be supersymmetric. This is just as well, since in order for the instanton to make any\nsense, some of the adjoint scalars must pick up masses at one loop. Otherwise the instanton\nwould have too many zero modes and too many negative modes. To simplify, let us consider\nthe 3-sphere in 4 non-compact dimensions. For the case of a single brane, the transverse\ndisplacements correspond to a scalar field of mass m2 = \u22123R\u22122 [34]. This scalar field has\na single negative mode, which is the constant l = 0 mode. A negative mode is precisely\nwhat is needed for an instanton to contribute to the imaginary part of the vacuum energy,\nand hence to contribute to false vacuum decay [21]. Also, there are four normalizable zero\nmodes, which are the spherical harmonics with l = 1. These correspond to the four spacetime translational modes of the instanton, which have to be treated as collective coordinates.\nThis Goldstone field gives a determinantal prefactor of the form [23]\nD=\n\n\u03c3 2 R2 \u03b6 \u2032 (\u22122)\n\u03a9,\neR\n4\n\nwhere \u03a9 = V T is the spacetime volume. The prefactor A in the nucleation rate (11) is\nobtained after dividing by \u03a9.\nIf there are 2 coincident branes, then in principle there would be two such fields \u03c61 and\n\u03c62 corresponding to the independent transverse displacements of the brane. However, only\nthe combination \u03c6+ = (\u03c61 + \u03c62 ) will correspond to a singlet under SU(2). The orthogonal\ncombination \u03c6\u2212 = (\u03c61 \u2212 \u03c62 ) will be in the adjoint. As mentioned above, if the instanton\nwith two coincident branes is to make any sense, this combination must aquire a positive\nmass at one loop so that there is a single negative mode, not two, and four normalizable\nzero modes in total. In other words, in order for the instanton to make sense, the branes\nmust attract each other. If they repelled each other or if they did not \"interact\", then the\ntwo brane configuration would in fact be an accidental superposition of two independent\nbubbles in the \"dilute gas\" of instantons. The mass of \u03c6\u2212 can be estimated as follows.\nThe mass of the gauge field A\u03bc is given by mA (\u03c6\u2212 ) \u223c MP2 f (d), where MP is the Planck\nmass, d is the distance between branes and f (d) \u2248 d for d \u226b MP\u22121 . This is because this\nvector corresponds to fundamental strings stretching from one brane to the other. For\n< M \u22121 , we may expect a milder behaviour for the mass, which we may\nsmaller distances, d \u223c\nP\nheuristically parametrize as a power f (d) \u2248 d(MP d)n , with n > 0. The canonical field is\nrelated to the distance through \u03c6\u2212 \u223c d\u03c3 1/2 . Hence,\nm2A \u223c MP4 f 2 (\u03c3 \u22121/2 \u03c6\u2212 ).\n16\n\n\fOn a flat brane, the effective potential induced by a gauge field of mass mA is proportional\nto m3A . However, it can be shown that on a sphere there is also a term of order m2A R\u22121 which\nwill in fact dominate at small mA . When these terms are added to the tree level potential\n\u22123R\u22122 \u03c62\u2212 , the scalar aquires a very tiny expectation value < \u03c6\u2212 >\u223c (\u03c3/RMP4 )1/2n \u03c3 1/2 MP\u22121 .\nIn the broken phase, \u03c6\u2212 has a positive mass squared of order m2\u03c6\u2212 \u223c nR\u22122 . The gauge\nbosons will in turn aquire imperceptibly tiny masses m2A \u226a R\u22122 .\nTo summarize, some of the scalars may get very large masses from the wrapping on a\ndegenerating cycle. These will decouple, and presumably will not contribute to the degeneracy factor. Others, corresponding to the relative position of the 2-branes in 3+1 dimensions\nwill get masses of order R\u22121 , and hence will contribute degeneracy factors of order one, just\nlike the conformally coupled field discussed above. For the massless or nearly massles gauge\nfields the contribution to the degeneracy factor will be of order one (the vectors have no\nzero modes on the sphere, so unlike the case of a scalar, a tiny mass will not cause a large\ndegeneracy factor). Similar considerations could be applied to fermions. Thus we expect\nthe total prefactor to be of order\nDtotal \u223c \u03a9\u03c3 2 R2 eak\n\n\u03b2\n\n(56)\n\nwhere a is a numerical factor and k \u03b2 is, as in Eq. (51), an estimate of the effective number\nof degrees of freedom. For a flat brane at weak coupling, \u03b2 = 2, but as argued by FMSW\nit could be lower for the wrapped brane. Unfortunately, without going into a very detailed\nanalysis (which is outside the scope of this paper) we are unable to determine the sign of\nthe constant a. However, as argued above, this value seems to be rather insensitive to the\nvalue of R or to the value of the ambient de Sitter temperature.\nFor a < 0 the nucleation of multiple branes is suppressed and we are back to the situation\ndescribed in Subsection IV.B. For a > 0 a disaster may occur because transitions into deep\nAnti-de Sitter space through multiple brane nucleation seem to be unsuppressed due to a\nlarge degeneracy factor. FMSW suggested that the disaster could be averted by an anthropic\nargument. If the step \u01eb in the vacuum energy is of the order of 3 in units of \u03c1M 0 , allowing the\nvalues ...,-2,1,4,... then the stringent anthropic bound for a negative cosmological constant\n> \u2212 \u03c1\n\u03c1\u039b \u223c\nM 0 would tell us that the vacuum energy is in fact the lowest allowed value in\nthe list, that is \u03c1\u039b \u223c \u03c1M 0 (note that this argument requires a certain adjustment of the\nstep \u01eb in order to explain the observed value). However, there is another problem which\nis how to explain the stability of this vacuum once it has been reached. In the F MSW\nscenario, the stability was attributted to the fact that in the vacuum with \u03c1\u039b \u223c \u03c1M 0 the\neffective temperature of the brane would be so low that the degeneracy factor is switched\noff. However, as we have seen, the degeneracy factor is quite independent on the ambient\nde Sitter temperatures and hence it does not seem to switch off. The same mechanism that\nwould enhance coincident brane nucleation from a high energy vacuum, would cause the\ndisastrous decay of \"our\" vacuum.\nFinally, we note that even if a mechanism could be devised to switch off the degeneracy\nfactor, so that the present vacuum is stable, the time coincidence tG \u223c t\u039b would be left\nunexplained by this approach (just as in the non-anthropic models discussed in Section\nVIII). Also, the unsuppressed nucleation of coincident branes seems to preclude eternal\ninflation, and even if one may intuitively argue that the lowest anthropic value is the most\nprobable, the actual probability distribution for positive \u03c1\u039b seems hard to estimate.\n17\n\n\fVI. SCALAR FIELD WITH A VERY FLAT POTENTIAL\n\nIn this class of models, what we perceive as a cosmological constant is in fact a potential\nV (\u03c6) of a scalar field \u03c6(x). The potential does not have a succession of minima as in Abbott's\nwashboard model, but its slope is assumed to be so small that the evolution of \u03c6 is slow on\nthe cosmological time scale. This is achieved if the slow roll conditions\n< \u03c1\nMP2 V \u2032\u2032 \u226a V \u223c\nM 0,\n\n(57)\n\n< \u03c1\nMP V \u2032 \u226a V \u223c\nM 0,\n\n(58)\n\nare satisfied up to the present time (here it is assumed that any \"true\" cosmological constant\nis also included in the potential V .) These conditions ensure that the field is overdamped by\nthe Hubble expansion, and that the kinetic energy is negligible compared with the potential\nenergy (so that the equation of state is basically that of a cosmological constant term.) The\nfield \u03c6 is also assumed to have negligible couplings to all fields other than gravity.\nLet us now suppose, as in the previous sections, that there was a period of inflation\ndriven by a different scalar field \u03c7. During inflation, massless scalar fields are randomized\nby quantum fluctuations, which cause their root mean squared value to increase with time\nas \u2206\u03c6 \u223c H(Ht)1/2 , where H is the inflationary expansion rate. If we consider a field of\nmass m, this effect competes with the classical drift down to the bottom of the potential,\nand after some time of order t \u223c Hm\u22122 a stationary distribution with root mean squared\n\u2206\u03c6 \u223c H 2 m\u22121 is established. This can be interpreted in terms of the Gibbons-Hawking\ntemperature T \u223c H of de Sitter space as the condition V (\u03c6) \u223c m2 \u03c62 \u223c T 4 . In this example,\nall field values |\u03c6| \u226a H 2 /m would be almost equally probable after the end of inflation. This\ndiscussion, however, assumes that inflation proceeds at almost the same rate for all field\nvalues in the range considered. That is, the differential expansion rate \u03b4H \u223c V (\u03c6)(HMP2 )\u22121\nis ignored.\nThe case of interest to us is slightly more general because the potential need not be\nquadratic, and also because we are not necessarily interested in field values near \u03c6 = 0.\nRather, we are interested in field values for which the energy density is in the anthropically\nallowed range\n< V (\u03c6) < 100\u03c1\n\u2212 \u03c1M 0 \u223c\nM 0.\n\u223c\n\n(59)\n\nThe differential expansion rate \u03b4H \u223c V (\u03c6)(HMP2 )\u22121 will be negligible if the time t \u223c\n(\u2206\u03c6)2anth H \u22123 that it takes for the field to fluctuate accross the anthropic range of \u03c6 corresponding to (59) is smaller than (\u03b4H)\u22121 for the same range. This requires\n(\u2206\u03c6)anth \u226a\n\nH2\n1/2\n\n10\u03c1M 0\n\nMP .\n\n(60)\n\nIf this condition is not satisfied, then the a priori probability for the field values with a higher\nV (\u03c6) would be exponentially enhanced with respect to the field values at the lower anthropic\nend. This would result in a prediction for the effective cosmological constant which would\nbe too high compared with observations. Therefore, in what follows, we shall demand that\nour potential satisfies Eqs. (57), (58) and (60).\n18\n\n\fA. Solving both cosmological constant problems.\n\nConsider a potential of the form [4],\n1\nV (\u03c6) = \u03c1bare + \u03bc2 \u03c62 ,\n2\n\n(61)\n\nwhere \u03c1bare represents the \"true\" cosmological constant. If \u03c1bare and \u03bc2 have opposite signs,\nthen the effective vacuum energy will be very small when\n|\u03c6| \u2248 |2\u03c1bare |1/2 |\u03bc|\u22121.\n\n(62)\n\nThe anthropic range is given by (\u2206\u03c6)anth \u223c 100\u03c1M 0|\u03bc2 \u03c1bare |\u22121/2 . Then, conditions (57), (58)\nand (60) imply\n1/2\n\n103\n\n\u03c1M 0\n\u03c1M 0\n\u03c1M 0\n\u226a |\u03bc| \u226a\n.\n2\n1/2\nH |\u03c1bare | MP\n|\u03c1bare |1/2 MP\n\n(63)\n\nFrom the cosmic microwave background temperature fluctuations we know that\n< 10\u22125 M . This leaves a wide range of possibilities for the value of the mass paramH\u223c\nP\neter,\n\u03bc \u223c (10\u2212167 \u2212 10\u2212120 )\n\nMP3\n,\n|\u03c1bare |1/2\n\n(64)\n\nspanning some 47 orders of magnitude. Provided that \u03bc is in this range, the a priori\nprobability distribution P\u2217 (\u03c6) for \u03c6 will be flat. The probability distribution for the effective\ncosmological constant \u03c1\u03c6 = V (\u03c6) is given by\nP\u2217 (\u03c1\u03c6 ) =\n\n1\nP\u2217 (\u03c6),\nV\u2032\n\nand it will also be very flat, since V \u2032 is almost constant in the anthropic range. As mentioned in Section II, a flat a priori distribution for the effective cosmological constant in the\nanthropic range entails an automatic explanation for the two cosmological constant puzzles\n[16,17].\nB. A small mass from instantons?\n\nThe challenge in the scenario presented above is to explain the small mass parameter (64).\nIn Ref. [4] we suggested that this can be achieved through instanton effects. For instance,\n\u03c6 could be a pseudo-Goldstone, the phase of a scalar field \u03a6 = \u03b7ei\u03c6/\u03b7 which spontaneously\nbreaks a global U(1) symmetry. Since global charge can be swallowed by wormholes, a small\nmass term for the field \u03c6 will be generated through gravitational instantons [35,36].\nAnother possibility is that the phase may have an \"axion\" coupling of the form\n\u03b1s\n\u03c6F\u0303 F,\n\u03b7\n19\n\n(65)\n\n\fwhere F is the field strength of a \"hidden\" gauge sector with gauge coupling constant \u03b1s .\nThe coupling (65) will give a small mass to the pseudoscalar \u03c6 through instanton effects.\nWe should mention, however, that there may be certain limitations in implementing this\nidea in the present context. Consider an instanton-induced potential of the form\nV (\u03c6) = \u03c1bare + \u039b4 cos(\u03c6/\u03b7).\nIn order to solve the cosmological constant problem we need\n> \u03c1\n\u039b4 \u223c\nbare .\n\nCombining this with the slow roll conditions (57) and (58) we find\n\u03b7 \u226b MP\n\n\u03c1bare\n.\n\u03c1M 0\n\nThus, the expectation value \u03b7 must be truly huge compared with the Planck scale.\nIn usual axion models, the effective vertex (65) can be obtained in the following way. The\nscalar field \u03a6 has Yukawa interactions of the form h\u03a6\u03a8\u0304\u03a8 with an \"exotic\" fermion \u03a8 (here\nh is the Yukawa coupling constant). The fermion in turn interacts with the non abelian\ngauge fields, and the coupling (65) is generated at one loop. The mass of the fermions in\nthe broken phase is given by m\u03a8 \u223c h\u03b7. In our case, this mass is extremely large (unless h\nis extremely small), and so we can hardly trust the field theory model for generating (65).\nPerhaps more worrisome is the effect of wormholes. For small symmetry breaking scale\n<\n\u03b7 \u223c MP the scale \u039b4 in the instanton potential is of order MP4 e\u2212S , where S \u223c MP /\u03b7 is the\nwormhole action [35,36]. The radius of the wormhole is given by R \u223c (MP \u03b7)\u22121/2 . This radius\napproaches the Planck scale as \u03b7 approaches MP , and the process becomes unsuppressed.\nThe instanton calculation becomes unreliable for higher values of \u03b7, but it is not clear what\nwould prevent nonperturbative gravitational effects from completely destroying the global\nsymmetry.\nTherefore, as mentioned above, the generation of a small mass through instantons may\nnot have a straightforward implementation in the present context. Clearly, this issue deserves\nfurther investigation (see e.g. [36]).\nC. A very flat potential from field renormalization\n\nConsider a potential of the form [18]\nV (\u03c6) = \u03c1bare + M 4 f (\u03bb\u03c6),\n\n(66)\n\nwhere M is a reasonable mass parameter and f is a function of order one with no large or\nsmall parameters. If the parameter \u03bb in the argument of f is chosen to be very small, then\nV (\u03c6) will be very flat. In particular, the mass term of the field \u03c6 which has two powers of \u03bb\nwill be very small. Weinberg suggested [18] that perhaps the smallness of \u03bb can be attributed\nto a large running of the field renormalization Z\u03bc from some fiducial short distance scale \u03bc\nto the large scales in which the cosmological constant is relevant, \u03bc \u2192 0.\nMore generally, as noted in Ref. [9], the effective Lagrangian for a scalar field \u03c8 at large\ndistances will include nonminimal kinetic terms,\n20\n\n\fL = F 2 (\u03c8)(\u2202\u03bc \u03c8)2 \u2212 V (\u03c8) + ...\n\n(67)\n\nHere, F plays the role of a field renormalization, which in fact may depend on \u03c8, and we\nhave omitted terms with more derivatives of \u03c8. If F is very large, then the field redefinition\nd\u03c6 = F d\u03c8\nwill result in a very flat effective potential for \u03c6.\nTake for instance F = e\u03c8/MP and V = \u03c1bare + (m2 /2)\u03c8 2 , where m is a not too large mass\nparameter (see below). After the change of variables we obtain\n1\nL = (\u2202\u03bc \u03c6)2 \u2212 \u03c1bare \u2212 m2 MP2 [ln(\u03c6/MP )]2 + ...\n2\nThe effective potential is now very flat at large \u03c6. The slow roll conditions (57) and (58)\nare satisfied for\nm2\nm\n> \u03c6\n\u03c6\u223c\nln\n.\nmin = MP\n2\nH0 H0\nThe antropic range m2 \u03c8 2 \u223c |\u03c1bare | will satisfy this condition provided that m \u226a\n|\u03c1bare |1/2 MP\u22121 . Finally, the condition (60) is easily satisfied by chosing a sufficiently high\n1/2\nHubble rate during inflation H 2 \u226b 103 \u03c10M (\u03c6/\u03c6min ).\nThus, starting from a Lagrangian (67) with fairly simple functions F and V we have\nbeen able to satisfy all necessary conditions to solve both cosmological constant problems.\nOf course, one may wonder why F should have exponential behaviour when V is only polynomial, and it would be good to find a well motivated physical setup where this Lagrangian\nemerges in a natural way.\nVII. A SLOWLY VARYING FOUR-FORM?\n\nIn theories with extra dimensions, the four form field strength is dynamical above the\ncompactification energy scale. Donoghue suggested [9] that in the early universe the fourform might take a continuum of different values in different parts of the universe, and that\nit might get frozen to these values as the universe cooled down below the compactification\nscale. However, it is easy to show that the effective cosmological constant can vary from\nplace to place only if the size of the internal space is also variable. As a result, the effect of\nthe four form is more properly described as a contribution to the effective potential for the\nradius modulus of the extra space.\nLet the higher dimensional manifold be the product of a four-dimensional spacetime M\nand an internal space S,\nds2 = g\u03bc\u03bd (x)dx\u03bc dx\u03bd + \u03c3ij (x, y)dy i dy j ,\n\n(68)\n\nwhere \u03bc, \u03bd = 0, ..., 3 are the four-dimensional indices and i, j = 1, ..., n are the internal space\n\u221a\nindices. The field strength takes the form, F = f (x, y)\u03c94 + ..., where \u03c94 = g (\u2227\u03bc dx\u03bc ) is\nthe four-dimensional volume form (g = \u2212 det g\u03bc\u03bd ) and the ellipsis denote terms with at least\none internal index (these do not behave as a four-form upon dimensional reduction). The\nequations of motion reduce to\n21\n\n\fdG = 0,\n\n(69)\n\n\u221a\nwhere G =\u2217 F = f (x, y)\u03c9n + ... is the dual of the field strength and \u03c9n = \u03c3 (\u2227i dy i ) is\nthe volume form on the internal space (\u03c3 = det \u03c3ij ). Consider two different points x1 and\nx2 on the 4D manifold M, and a curve \u03b312 joining them. Applying Stokes theorem to the\n\"cylinder\" \u03b312 \u00d7 S (where S is the internal space), and using the equations of motion (69),\nwe immediately find that\nZ\n\nS;x1\n\nG\u2212\n\nZ\n\nS;x2\n\nG=\n\nZ\n\nS\u00d7\u03b312\n\ndG = 0,\n\n(70)\n\nfor arbitrary x1 and x2 . Assume that the internal metric factorizes as\n\u03c3ij = e2\u03c8(x) \u03c3\u0303ij (y).\nThen, Eq. (70) implies\n\nf \u0304(x) = f0 e\u2212n\u03c8(x) ,\n\nwhere f \u0304(x) is the average of f (x, y) over the internal space and f0 is a constant. KaluzaKlein modes average to zero on the internal space and do not contribute to f \u0304. However such\nmodes are massive in the reduced theory and do not behave as an effective cosmological\nconstant. It follows that the contribution of the four form to the effective cosmological\nconstant is\nZ\n\u221a\n1\n1\n1 2\nF \u2261\n(71)\nF\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 F \u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 \u03c3 dn y = F02 e\u2212n\u03c8(x) ,\n2\n2 * 4! S\n2\nR \u221a\nwhere F02 = f02 S \u03c3\u0303 dn y = const.\nIn the dimensionally reduced theory, \u03c8(x) is a four dimensional scalar field, and (71) is\njust a contribution to its effective potential V (\u03c8). At the classical level, there are two other\n(4+n)\nsuch contributions, due to a bare higher dimensional cosmological constant \u039bbare and due\nto the curvature of the internal manifold. Following Refs. [37], it is easy to show that in\nterms of the Einstein frame metric \u1e21\u03bc\u03bd = en\u03c8 g\u03bc\u03bd , the effective action takes the form\nM2\nS= P\n2\n\nZ\n\n\u221a\n\n#\n\n\"\n\nn(2 + n) \u03bc\u03bd\n\u1e21 \u2202\u03bc \u03c8\u2202\u03bd \u03c8 \u2212 V (\u03c8) ,\n\u1e21 d4 x R\u0304 \u2212\n2\n\nwith\nV (\u03c8) = \u039b0 e\u2212n\u03c8 +\n\nF02 \u22123n\u03c8 K \u2212(2+n)\u03c8\ne\n\u2212\ne\n.\n2\n2\n\n(4+n)\n\n2\nHere RMP\u221a\n= M\u22172+n V0 and \u039b0 = \u039bbare V0 , where M\u2217 is the higher dimensional Planck mass,\nV0 = S \u03c3\u0303dn y = const., and K is defined by R\u0303ij = (K/n)\u03c3\u0303ij . In general, the potential may\nhave a minimum but this need not be near V = 0. For n > 1 one can adjust the parameters\n\u039b0 and F0 so that the minimum is at the right height to fit observations , but this would\nbe the usual fine-tuning (for n = 1 the minimum must have negative effective cosmological\nconstant, so this tuning is not possible). We may also consider the possibility that the field\n\u03c8 is away from the minimum, but slowly rolling so that the effective potential V (\u03c8) plays\nthe role of an effective cosmological constant, as described in Section VI. The problem is that\nif the slow roll conditions are met, then \u03c8 would have a negligible mass and would mediate\nlong range interactions of gravitational strength, which are ruled out by observations.\n\n22\n\n\fVIII. NON-ANTHROPIC APPROACHES\n\nHere we comment on some attempts to solve the cosmic coincidence problem without\nresorting to the anthropic principle. In a recent paper [7] Arkani-Hamed et. al. suggested an\nexplanation to the approximate coincidence of several cosmological timescales: the time of\nmatter-radiation equality teq , the time of \u039b-domination t\u039b , and the time of galaxy formation\ntG . They assume that the Planck scale MP and the electroweak scale Mw are the only\nrelevant scales and argue that the temperature at matter-radiation equality and the vacuum\nenergy should then be given by\nTeq \u223c Mw2 /MP ,\n\n(72)\n\n\u03c1\u039b \u223c (Mw2 /MP )4 .\n\n(73)\n\nIt follows immediately from (72),(73) that teq \u223c t\u039b . This coincidence should of course be\nunderstood in a very rough sense, since the actual values of teq and t\u039b in our universe differ\nby a few orders of magnitude. Now, assuming the density fluctuation amplitude\nQ \u2261 \u03b4\u03c1/\u03c1 \u223c 10\u22125 ,\n\n(74)\n\nand using a more accurate value for teq /t\u039b , the authors show from (73) that the epoch of\ngalaxy formation is at\ntG \u223c t\u039b .\n\n(75)\n\nIn our view, a relation like (73) may account for the smallness of \u039b and may even explain\nits observed value. However, the cosmic coincidence (75) would remain unexplained. The\ntime of \u039b-domination is determined by the value of \u039b, while the epoch of galaxy formation\nis determined by the amplitude of density fluctuations Q. Even if we explain the value of \u039b,\nwe still have to explain why the value of Q is such that tG \u223c t\u039b . Moreover, the accuracy of a\nfew orders of magnitude is not sufficient to explain the cosmic time coincidence: observations\nindicate that the coincidence (75) is accurate within one order of magnitude.\nAnother non-anthropic approach to solving the cosmic coincidence problem involves kessence, a scalar field with a non-trivial kinetic term [8]. k-essence has a positive effective\npressure during the radiation era and starts acting as an effective cosmological constant\nwith the onset of matter domination. With a suitable choice of parameters it dominates\nthe universe at t\u039b \u223c tG . However, one could also choose parameters to obtain t\u039b \u226a tG or\nt\u039b \u226b tG . This model can explain why \u039b-domination occurs at t > teq , but it cannot account\nfor the coincidence (75).\nIX. MODELS WITH VARIABLE Q\n\nSeveral authors have recently expressed the view that the anthropic principle can perhaps\nbe applied to the cosmological constant problem - but to nothing else! [38,26] For instance,\nWeinberg has remarked [18] that we cannot explain the masses and charges of the elementary\nparticles by assuming that they depend on the expectation values of scalar fields with very\n23\n\n\fflat potentials. These light fields would couple to the elementary particles, and would have\nbeen observed in collisions and decays.\nWhile this remark may be true, we can still apply the anthropic principle to variables\nwhich determine the large scale properties of the Universe, and which generically fall into\nthe category of \"initial conditions\". Examples of these are the amplitude of primordial\nfluctuations Q [41,39,16], the density parameter \u03a9 [40,39], or even the baryon asymmetry.\nIn the inflationary context, these parameters depend on the path that the inflaton field takes\nin going from the diffusion regime to thermalization. The inflaton potential represented in\nFig. 2 is one-dimensional, and there is a single path from the top of the potential to the\nlocal minimum. However, more generally, the inflaton has several components, and there\nmay be a continuum of paths from the diffusion region to a given minimum. Even if the\nlow energy particle physics Lagrangian is the same in all thermalized regions, and even if\nthere are no exotic light degrees of freedom after thermalization, these regions may start\nwith different initial conditions which will be more or less favourable to galaxy formation.\nConsider for instance [39] a two component scalar field \u03c7 = \u03c71 + i\u03c72 = |\u03c7|ei\u0398 , with\n> M . However,\npotential V (\u03c7) = (g1 \u03c721 + g2\u03c722 )/2. This potential produces inflation for |\u03c7| \u223c\nP\nthe amplitude of density perturbations Q depends on the direction \u0398 of approach to the\nminimum, Q \u223c m(\u0398)N(|\u03c7|)MP\u22121 . Here m2 (\u0398) = g1 cos2 \u0398+g2 sin2 \u0398 and N \u223c |\u03c7|2 MP\u22122 \u223c 60\nis the number of e-foldings from the time the present Hubble scale first crossed the horizon\nuntil the end of inflation. The minimum at \u03c7 = 0 will be reached from different directions\nin different thermalized regions, and therefore these regions will have a different value of Q\nas an initial condition. This example illustrates that Q can easily be made into a random\nvariable. In general, its a priori distribution P\u2217 (Q) (i.e. its volume distribution at the time\nof thermalization) will not necessarily be flat in the anthropically allowed range. For any\ngiven model, this distribution can be calculated using the numerical methods of Ref. [29].\nTo proceed, however, we shall heuristically parametrize it as\ndP\u2217 (Q) \u223c Q\u2212\u03b1 d ln Q,\n\n(76)\n\nwhere \u03b1 is a constant (this may not necessarily be a good estimate for the particlular model\npresented above, but we shall use it anyway for the sake of argument.)\nWe may now take a point of view which is \"complementary\" to the one used in the\npreceeding sections. Let us assume that the cosmological constant is truly a constant of\norder Mw8 MP\u22126 determined from the fundamental theory (as assumed e.g. in [7]), and that\nQ is a random variable with prior distribution (76). If \u03b1 > 0, then low values of Q will be\nfavoured a priori. However, if Q is too low, galaxies will not have time to form before the\ntime t\u039b when the cosmological constant starts dominating. With this, we would basically\nexplain why Q \u223c 10\u22125 as well as the time coincidence tG \u223c t\u039b . These arguments can be\nmade more quantitative in the following way. The probability distribution for a galaxy to\nform at time tG is given by\ndP(tG ) \u221d P\u2217 (Q)\n\nd\u03bd(tG , t\u039b , Q)\nd ln Q dtG .\ndtG\n\n(77)\n\nHere, \u03bd(tG , t\u039b , Q) is the fraction of matter that clusters up to the time tG in a universe where\nthe density contrast at the time of recombination is Q and where the cosmological constant\nis such that it will start dominating at the time t\u039b . This fraction can be easily estimated\n24\n\n\fby using the Press-Schechter approximation. In Ref. [16] it was shown [see Eq. (27) of that\nreference] that after integrating over Q the probability distribution for tG is given by\ndP(tG ) \u221d\nwhere\n\n5 1+x\nF (x) =\n6\nx\n\u0012\n\ndF \u03b1\ndx\ndx\n\n\u00131/2 Z\n\n(78)\ndw\n,\n+ w)3/2\n\nx\n0\n\nw 1/6 (1\n\nand\nx = sinh2 (tG /t\u039b ).\n(Following [16], we are using the convention that t\u039b is the time at which \u03a9\u039b = \u03a9M sinh2 1,\nwhere \u03a9i are the fractional densities of cosmological constant and non-relativistic matter\nrespectively.) The distribution (78) is plotted in Fig. 3 for different values of \u03b1, and we see\nthat for moderate values of \u03b1 it presents a rather prominent peak at tG \u223c t\u039b , as expected\nfrom the general arguments above.\n\n3\n\n1.5\n\n0\n\n1\n\n5\n\n2\n\ndP\u0090dtG\n\n4\n\n3\n\n5\n\n6\n\ntG\u0090tL\n\nFIG. 3. Probability distribution for tG /t\u039b , the time of galaxy formation as compared to the time\nwhen the cosmological constant starts dominating. Here, \u039b is taken to be a fundamental constant\nbut the density contrast Q is treated as a random variable with a priori volume distribution \u221d Q\u2212\u03b1\nat the time of thermalization. The plot is shown for \u03b1 = 1.5, 3 and 5. The distributions present\nrather well defined peaks at tG \u223c t\u039b .\n\nFinally, one may take the view that both \u039b and Q are random variables. This possibility\nwas considered in [16], where it was shown that a decreasing a priori distribution for Q\npushes the cosmological constant to small values, so that both tG and t\u039b tend to be very\n25\n\n\flarge. In this case, a new time scale comes into play. This is the so-called cooling boundary\ntcb [41]. For times t > tcb gravitationally collapsing clouds of galactic mass cannot fragment\ninto stars because they are too cold to reach the usual \"cooling\" line emission thresholds,\nand they stay as pressure supported configurations for a very long time. Thus, usual galaxy\nformation is suppressed after t \u223c tcb \u2248 3*1010Y r. This time is determined from microphysical\nparameters such as the fine structure constant, the proton mass and the fraction of baryonic\nmatter. Since the time of galaxy formation cannot be arbitrarily large, in the situation\nwhere both Q and \u039b are random variables we expect tG \u223c t\u039b \u223c tcb (see [16] for details).\nThere are many uncertainties associated with the calculation of tcb . Perhaps after some of\nthese uncertainties are removed, we may actually find that tcb \u226b tG \u223c t\u039b . This hypothetical\nsituation would suggest that one of the timescales tG and t\u039b is not a random variable, or that\nif both of them are, then their a priori distribution must have a rather peculiar behaviour.\nThis in turn would give us information on the theories of initial conditions giving rise to\nthese a priori distributions.\nThese examples seem to suggest that the applicability of anthropic reasoning, once it is\naccepted, may easily go beyond the issue of the cosmological constant problem.\nX. CONCLUSIONS\n\nThe anthropic principle has a bad reputation. It is often regarded as a handwaving argument relying on poorly understood phenomena like intelligent life and having no predictive\npower. Although this criticism is not entirely ungrounded, there is a class of cosmological\nmodels where the use of anthropic principle is not only justified but may in fact be inevitable, and where it can be used to make quantitative predictions. These are the models\nin which some cosmological parameters, or physical \"constants\", take different values in\ndifferent parts of the universe. In such models, one cannot predict the precise values of the\nparameters that we are going to observe. One can only hope to calculate the corresponding\nprobability distributions. The criteria for justifying (and compelling) the use of anthropic\nprinciple are that the model should provide (i) a mechanism for variation of the parameters and (ii) a way of calculating the probability distributions. Once the probabilities are\ncalculated, one can predict that the parameters are going to be observed within a certain\nrange of values, say, at a 95% confidence level. This seems to be as quantitative as one can\npossibly get in this class of models.\nFrom a practical point of view, parameters that we can hope to determine anthropically\nshould satisfy the condition that they do not affect life processes, and preferably should also\nnot affect the poorly understood astrophysical processes such as star formation [40,16,26].\nSo for example the gravitational constant may be hard to determine anthropically with our\npresent level of understanding, since it affects both the evolution of life and star formation.\nHowever, gravity does not change chemistry, which is already a big simplification. So it is\nnot inconceivable that the value of Newton's constant may in the future receive an anthropic\nexplanation.\nIn this paper we discussed anthropic approaches to solving the two cosmological constant\nproblems (CCPs). The first (old) CCP is the discrepancy between the observed small value of\n\u03c1\u039b and the large values suggested by particle physics models. The second (time coincidence)\nCCP is the puzzling coincidence between the epoch of galaxy formation tG and the epoch of\n26\n\n\f\u039b-domination t\u039b . While it is conceivable that the old CCP can be resolved by fundamental\nphysics [42,43,7,44], we have argued that the time coincidence problem calls for an anthropic\nexplanation.\nWe first considered models with a discrete spectrum of \u03c1\u039b . These include Abbott's scalar\nfield model with a \"washboard\" potential [19], as well as models in which \u03c1\u039b can change\nthrough brane nucleation accompanied by a change of the four-form field F [25,5,6,9]. Such\nmodels can solve both CCPs, provided that (i) the separation between the discrete values\n< \u03c1\nof \u03c1\u039b is \u01eb \u223c\nM 0 , where \u03c1M 0 is the present matter density, (ii) the probability distribution\nfor \u03c1\u039b at the end of inflation is nearly flat, P\u2217 (\u03c1\u039b ) \u2248 const, and (iii) the brane nucleation\nrate is sufficiently low, so that the present vacuum energy does not drop significantly in less\nthan a Hubble time. We discussed the cosmology of this class of models, the calculation of\nthe prior distribution P\u2217 (\u03c1\u039b ), and the observational constraints on the model parameters.\nThe required values of the \"level separation\" \u01eb may appear uncomfortably small, but\nFeng, March-Russell, Sethi and Wilczek (FMSW) [6] have argued that they can naturally\narise due to non-perturbative effects in M-theory. In M-theory-related models, the brane\n1/2\ntension \u03c3 is related to \u01eb through \u01eb \u223c \u03c3\u03c1bare /Mp and should also be very small. Our analysis\nshows that in such models the conditions (i)-(iii) cannot be satisfied without fine-tuning of\nthe parameters.\nIt was conjectured by Weinberg [12] that the condition (ii) of a flat a priori distribution\nfor \u039b would automatically be satisfied in any particle physics model where the cosmological\nconstant is a random variable. In Ref. [4] we showed that this conjecture is not always\nsatisfied in models where the role of the cosmological constant is played by a slowly varying\nfield. Here, we have shown that the conjecture is generically not satisfied in four-form models\neither. In fact, this condition has to be enforced in order to fit observations. This, in turn,\nplaces severe constraints on the model parameters. Hence, in trying to solve the cosmological\nconstant problems by anthropic means, the flat a priori distribution for \u039b cannot be taken\nfor granted and the problem of calculating P\u2217 has to be addressed.\nBousso and Polchinsky [5] have studied models with multiple four-form fields Fi and\nfound that the spectrum of the allowed values of \u03c1\u039b can be sufficiently dense even for large\nbrane tensions. However, in this case the vacua with nearby values of \u03c1\u039b have very different\nvalues of Fi , and a flat probability distribution required in (ii) is rather unlikely. Moreover,\nthe low-energy physics in such vacua is likely to be different, and it appears that the anthropic\napproach to solving the CCPs cannot be applied in this case [26].\nFor models unrelated to M-theory, \u03c3 and \u01eb are generally unrelated, and values consistent\nwith the constraints (i)-(iii) can easily be found. However, if one gives up the M-theory\nconnection, then the FMSW argument cannot be used, and one has to seek an alternative\nexplanation for the tiny value of \u01eb. Alternatively, one might seek modifications of the FMSW\nmodel that could relax the relation between \u01eb and \u03c3.\nAll of the earlier discussions of the cosmology of discrete \u039b models encountered the\n\"empty universe problem\" [31,19,25,5,6,9,26]. In order to make the present vacuum sufficiently stable, the brane nucleation has to be strongly suppressed. One then finds that the\ntime it takes the universe to evolve from some initial high value of \u03c1\u039b to the present low value\nis much greater than the present Hubble time. This suggests that by the time the process\nis complete, any matter that the universe initially had may get diluted to an extremely low\ndensity, so that one would end up with an empty universe dominated by the cosmological\n27\n\n\fconstant.\nWe have argued that the empty universe problem disappears when the eternal nature\nof inflation is taken into account. During inflation, brane nucleations leading to higher\nand lower values of \u03c1\u039b have nearly equal probabilities. As a result, the values of \u03c1\u039b are\nrandomized, with different parts of the universe thermalizing with different values. The\nresulting probability distribution P\u2217 (\u03c1\u039b ) can be calculated using the stochastic formalism\nwe developed in Section IV. The slow rate of brane nucleation is not a problem in eternal\ninflation, since an unlimited amount of time is available.\nFMSW suggested an interesting possibility that nucleation of multiple branes could be\nenhanced by a large degeneracy factor due to the light fields living on the branes. If true,\nthis could significantly modify the brane model cosmology. In Section V we studied multiple\nbrane nucleation in some detail and found that the pre-exponential factor in the brane\nnucleation rate can both enhance and suppress multiple brane nucleation, depending on\nthe field content of the branes. We also concluded that models in which multiple brane\nnucleation dominates can be ruled out, because in such models there is nothing to prevent\nour present vacuum from tunneling down to deep anti-de Sitter space.\nWe also discussed models with a continuous spectrum of \u03c1\u039b , in which the role of the\ncosmological constant is played by the potential V (\u03c6) of a scalar field \u03c6(x). The potential\nhas to be very flat, so that its value does not significantly evolve on the present Hubble time\nscale. The values of the field \u03c6 are randomized by quantum fluctuations during inflation,\nand models can easily be constructed in which the resulting probability distribution for\nV (\u03c6) is nearly flat in the range of interest, thus solving both CCPs. The challenge here is to\njustify the very flat potentials required in this class of models. Possibilities include a pseudoGoldstone field which acquires a potential through instanton effects [4], a large running of the\nfield renormalization [18], and a non-minimal kinetic term with an exponential \u03c6-dependence\n[9]. We have pointed out some difficulties of the instanton approach.\nWe thus see that both discrete and continuous \u039b models could in principle solve both of\nthe CCPs. However, none of the models that have been suggested so far appears particularly\nwell motivated or natural.\nAn alternative approach is to assume that the old CCP can be solved within the fundamental theory. The cosmological constant is then truly a constant and is given by an\nexpression like \u03c1\u039b \u223c Mw4 MP\u22122 , as in [7]. At the same time, the amplitude of density fluctuations Q could be a random variable, so that the epoch of galaxy formation tG is different in\ndifferent parts of the universe. We have shown in Section VIII that, for a wide class of prior\ndistributions P\u2217 (Q), most of the galaxies will be in regions where tG \u223c t\u039b , thus explaining\nthe cosmic time coincidence. It would be interesting to extend this analysis and calculate\nthe distribution P\u2217 (Q) for some models with a variable Q. One would then have some idea\nof how naturally the distributions of the required type can be obtained.\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nJ.G. is grateful to Alex Pomarol and to Klaus Kirsten for useful and enjoyable discussions.\nThis work was supported by the Templeton Foundation under grant COS 253.

[6] has appeared. There, it is pointed out that the relation (21) between the tension \u03c3 and the charge\ndensity q of the brane does not hold for branes wrapping on degenerating cycles. Instead, the\ntension is suppressed by an exponential factor relative to the charge. We note two potential\nproblems with this picture. First, as it was argued in Ref. [45], the brane charge and tension\nappear to be unprotected against renormalization below the supersymmetry breaking scale.\nSuch renormalization would make the brane charge q unacceptably large. Second, if for some\nreason the brane parameters do not get renormalized, then, in order to satisfy the anthropic\nconstraint (22) on q, the brane tension has to be exceedingly small. The instanton action\n(9) would then be small and brane nucleation would be completely unsuppressed.\n2- A new approach to explaining very flat scalar potentials and branes with a very small\nfour-form charge has been suggested in Ref. [45], where these features are attributed to a\nspontaneously broken discrete symmetry.\n\n[1] S. Perlmutter et al., Ap.J. 483, 565 (1997); S. Perlmutter et al., astro-ph/9812473 (1998);\nB.
