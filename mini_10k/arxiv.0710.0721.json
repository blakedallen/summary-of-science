Coacting on a basic instanton on a noncommutative four-sphere S\u03b84 , we construct a noncommutative family of instantons of charge 1. The family is parametrized by the\nquantum quotient of SL\u03b8 (2, H) by Sp\u03b8 (2).\n\n\f1\n\nIntroduction\n\nSelf-dual (and anti-self-dual) solutions of Yang\u2013Mills equations have played an important\nrole both in mathematics and physics. Commonly called (anti-)instantons, they are connections with self-dual curvature on smooth G-bundles over a four dimensional compact\nmanifold M. In particular, one considers SU(2) instantons on the sphere S 4 .\nGeneral solutions are constructed by the ADHM method of [2] and it is known [3]\nthat the moduli space of SU(2)-instantons, with instanton charge k \u2013 the second Chern\nclass of the bundle \u2013 is a (8k \u2212 3)-dimensional manifold Mk . For k = 1 the moduli space\nM1 is isomorphic to an open ball in R5 [11] and, in this construction, generic moduli\nare obtained from the so-called basic instanton. The latter is though of as a quaternion\nline bundle over P1 H \u2243 S 4 with connection induced from H2 by orthogonal projection.\nAll other instantons of charge 1 are obtained from the basic one with the action of the\nconformal group SL(2, H) modulo the isometry group Sp(2) = Spin(5). The resulting\nhomogeneous space is M1 ; it is also the space of quaternion Hermitean structures in H2 .\nThe attempt to generalize to noncommutative geometry the ADHM construction of\nSU(2) instantons together with their moduli space is the starting motivation behind\npapers [14], [15], [13] and the present one. A noncommutative principal fibration A(S\u03b84 ) \u0592\u2192\nA(S\u03b87 ) which 'quantizes' the classical SU(2)-Hopf fibration over S 4 , has been constructed\nin [14] on the toric noncommutative four-sphere S\u03b84 . The generators of A(S\u03b84) are the\nentries of a projection p which describes the basic instanton on A(S\u03b84 ). That is, p gives a\nprojective module of finite type p[A(S\u03b84 )]4 and a connection \u2207 = p \u25e6 d on it, which has a\nself-dual curvature and charge 1, in some appropriate sense; this is the basic instanton.\nIn [15] infinitesimal instantons ('the tangent space to the moduli space') were constructed\nusing infinitesimal conformal transformations, that is elements in a quantized enveloping\nalgebra U\u03b8 (so(5, 1)). In the present paper, we look at a global construction and obtain\nother charge 1 instantons by 'quantizing' the actions of the Lie groups SL(2, H) and Sp(2)\non the basic instanton which enter the classical construction [1].\nThe paper is organized as follows. In Sect. 2 we recall the structure of the SU(2)principal Hopf fibration S\u03b87 \u2192 S\u03b84 . Sect. 3 is devoted to the construction of \u03b8-deformations\nA(SL\u03b8 (2, H)) and A(Sp\u03b8 (2)) of the corresponding classical groups, endowed with Hopf\nalgebra structures. The algebras A(S\u03b87), A(S\u03b84 ) are then described as quantum homogeneous spaces of A(Sp\u03b8 (2)) as illustrated at the end of the section. In Sect. 4 we consider\nthe coactions of A(SL\u03b8 (2, H)) and A(Sp\u03b8 (2)) on the Hopf fibration S\u03b87 \u2192 S\u03b84 . We use\nthese coactions in Sect. 5 to construct a noncommutative family of instantons by means\nof the algebra given by the quantum quotient of A(SL\u03b8 (2, H)) by A(Sp\u03b8 (2)). This turns\nout to be a noncommutative algebra generated by 6 elements subject to a 'hyperboloid'\nrelation. We finish by mentioning relations to the notion of quantum families of maps as\nproposed in [23, 20] and by stressing some open problems.\n\n2\n\nThe principal fibration\n\nThe class of deformations that we work with is the one of 'toric noncommutative spaces'\nintroduced in [8] and further elaborated in [7]. In [14] a noncommutative principal fibration A(S\u03b84) \u0592\u2192 A(S\u03b87 ) was introduced and infinitesimal instantons on it were constructed\nin [15] using infinitesimal conformal transformations. We refer to these latter papers for\n2\n\n\fa detailed description of the inclusion A(S\u03b84 ) \u0592\u2192 A(S\u03b87 ) as a noncommutative principal\nfibration (with classical SU(2) as structure group) and for its use for noncommutative\ninstantons. Here we limit ourself to a brief description. The coordinate algebra A(S\u03b87 ) on\nthe sphere S\u03b87 is the \u2217-algebra generated by elements {zj , zj\u2217 ; j = 1, . . . , 4} with relations\nzj zk = \u03bbjk zk zj ,\nzj\u2217 zk = \u03bbkj zk zj\u2217 ,\nzj\u2217 zk\u2217 = \u03bbjk zk\u2217 zj\u2217 ,\n(2.1)\nP \u2217\nand spherical relation\nzj zj = 1. The deformation matrix (\u03bbjk ) is taken so to allow\nan action by automorphisms of the undeformed group SU(2) on A(S\u03b87) and so that the\nsubalgebra of invariants under this action is identified with the coordinate algebra A(S\u03b84 )\nof a sphere S\u03b84 . With deformation parameter \u03bb = e2\u03c0i\u03b8 the \u2217-algebra A(S\u03b84 ) is generated\nby a central element x and elements \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b1\u2217, \u03b2 \u2217 with commutation relations\n\u03b1\u03b2 = \u03bb\u03b2\u03b1 ,\n\n\u03b1\u2217 \u03b2 \u2217 = \u03bb\u03b2 \u2217 \u03b1\u2217 ,\n\n\u03b2 \u2217 \u03b1 = \u03bb\u03b1\u03b2 \u2217 ,\n\n\u03b2\u03b1\u2217 = \u03bb\u03b1\u2217 \u03b2 ,\n\n(2.2)\n\nand spherical relation \u03b1\u2217 \u03b1 + \u03b2 \u2217 \u03b2 + x2 = 1. All this (including the relation between the\ndeformation parameter for S\u03b87 and S\u03b84 ) is most easily seen by taking the generators of\nA(S\u03b84 ) as the entries of a projection which yields an 'instanton bundle' over S\u03b84 . Consider\nthe matrix-valued function on S\u03b87 given by\n\u0013t\n\u0012\nz1 \u2212z2\u2217 z3 \u2212z4\u2217\nu = (|\u03c81 i , |\u03c82 i) =\n,\n(2.3)\nz2 z1\u2217 z4 z3\u2217\nwhere t denotes matrix transposition, and |\u03c81 i , |\u03c82 i are elements in the right A(S\u03b87 )module C4 \u2297 A(S\u03b87P\n). They are orthonormal with respect to the A(S\u03b87 )-valued Hermitean\nstructure h\u03be, \u03b7i = \u03bej\u2217 \u03b7j and as a consequence, u\u2217 u = I2 . Hence the matrix\np = uu\u2217 = |\u03c81 i h\u03c81 | + |\u03c82 i h\u03c82 |\n\n(2.4)\n\nis a self-adjoint idempotent with entries in A(S\u03b84 ); we have explicitly:\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n1+x\n0\n\u03b1\n\u03b2\n1\uf8ec 0\n1 + x \u2212\u03bc \u03b2 \u2217 \u03bc \u03b1\u2217 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7,\np= \uf8ec\n(2.5)\n\u2217\n\u2212\u03bc \u03b2 1 \u2212 x\n0 \uf8f8\n2\uf8ed \u03b1\n\u03b2\u2217\n\u03bc\u03b1\n0\n1\u2212x\n\u221a\nwith \u03bc = \u03bb = e\u03c0i\u03b8 . The generators of A(S\u03b84 ), bilinear in those of A(S\u03b87 ), are given by\n\u03b1 = 2(z1 z3\u2217 + z2 z4\u2217 ) ,\n\n\u03b2 = 2(\u2212z1 z4 + z2 z3 ) ,\n\nx = z1 z1\u2217 + z2 z2\u2217 \u2212 z3 z3\u2217 \u2212 z4 z4\u2217 .\n\n(2.6)\n\nThe defining relation of the algebra A(S\u03b87) can be given on the entries of the matrix u in\n(2.3). Writing u = (uia ), with i, j = 1, . . . , 4 and a = 1, 2, one gets\nuia ujb = \u03b7ji ujbuia .\nwith \u03b7 = (\u03b7ij ) the matrix\n\n\uf8eb\n\n1\n\uf8ec1\n\u03b7=\uf8ec\n\uf8ed\u03bc\n\u03bc\n\n1\n1\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n3\n\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\n1\n1\n\n\uf8f6\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\uf8f7\n\uf8f7.\n1\uf8f8\n1\n\n(2.7)\n\n(2.8)\n\n\fThe deformation matrix (\u03bbjk ) in (2.1) is just the above \u03b7 with entries rearranged.\nThe finitely generated projective A(S\u03b84 )-module E = p[A(S\u03b84)]4 is isomorphic to the\nmodule of equivariant maps from A(S\u03b87 ) to C2 describing the vector bundle associated\nvia the fundamental representation of SU(2). On E one has the Grassmann connection\n\u2207 := p \u25e6 d : E \u2192 E \u2297A(S\u03b84 ) \u03a91 (S\u03b84 ),\n\n(2.9)\n\nwith \u03a9(S\u03b84 ) a natural differential calculus on S\u03b84 . There is also a natural Hodge star\noperator \u2217\u03b8 (see below). The connection has a self-dual curvature \u22072 = p(dp)2 , that is,\n\u0001\n\u2217\u03b8 p(dp)2 = p(dp)2 ;\nIts 'topological charge' is computed to be 1 by a noncommutative index theorem. This\n'basic' noncommutative instanton has been given a twistor description in [5].\n\nThe two algebras A(S\u03b87) and A(S\u03b84 ) can be described in terms of a deformed (a 'star')\nproduct on the undeformed algebras A(S 7 ) and A(S 4 ). Both spheres S 7 and S 4 carry an\naction of the torus T2 , which is compatible with the action of SU(2) on the total space\nS 7 . In other words, it is an action on the principal SU(2)-bundle S 7 \u2192 S 4 . The action\nby automorphisms on the algebra A(S 4 ) is given simply by\n\u03c3t : (x, \u03b1, \u03b2) 7\u2192 (x, e2\u03c0it1 \u03b1, e2\u03c0it2 \u03b2),\nfor t = (t1 , t2 ) \u2208 T2 . Now, any polynomial in the algebra A(S 4) is decomposed into\nelements which are homogeneous under this action. An element fr \u2208 A(S 4 ) is said to be\nhomogeneous of bidegree r = (r1 , r2 ) \u2208 Z2 if\n\u03c3t (fr ) = e2\u03c0i(r1 t1 +r2 t2 ) fr ,\nand each f \u2208 A(S 4 ) is a unique finite sum of homogeneous elements [17]. This decomposition corresponds to writing the polynomial f in terms of monomials in the generators.\nLet now \u03b8 = (\u03b8jk = \u2212\u03b8kj ) be a real antisymmetric 2 \u00d7 2 matrix (thus given by a\nsingle real number, \u03b812 = \u03b8, say). The \u03b8-deformation of A(S 4 ) is defined by replacing the\nordinary product by a deformed product, given on homogeneous elements by\nfr \u00d7\u03b8 gs := e\u03c0i\u03b8(r1 s2 \u2212r2 s1 ) fr gs ,\n\n(2.10)\n\nand extended linearly to all elements in A(S 4). The vector space A(S 4 ) equipped with the\nproduct \u00d7\u03b8 is denoted by A(S\u03b84). On the other hand, the algebra A(S 7 ) does not carry an\naction of this T2 but rather a lifted action of a double cover 2-torus [15]. Nonetheless, the\nlifted action still allows us to define the algebra A(S\u03b87 ) by endowing the vector space A(S 7 )\nwith a deformed product similar to the one in (2.10). As the notation suggests, these\ndeformed algebras are shown to be isomorphic to the algebras defined by the relations in\nequations (2.1) and (2.2).\nIn fact, the torus action can be extended to forms and one also deforms the exterior\nalgebra of forms via a product like the one in (2.10) on spectral components so producing\ndeformed exterior algebras \u03a9(S\u03b84 ) and \u03a9(S\u03b87 ). As for functions, these are isomorphic as\nvector spaces to their undeformed counterparts but endowed with a deformed product.\n4\n\n\fAs mentioned, the spheres S\u03b84 and S\u03b87 are examples of toric noncommutative manifolds\n(originally called isospectral deformations [8]). They have noncommutative geometries via\nspectral triples whose Dirac operator and Hilbert space of spinors are the classical ones:\nonly the algebra of functions and its action on the spinors is changed. In particular, having\nan undeformed Dirac operator (or, in other words, an undeformed metric structure) one\ntakes as a Hodge operator \u2217\u03b8 the undeformed operator on each spectral component of the\nalgebra of forms.\n\n3\n\nDeformations of the groups SL(2, H) and Sp(2)\n\nOur interest in deforming the groups SL(2, H) and Sp(2) is motivated by their use for the\nconstruction of instantons on S 4 . Classically, charge 1 instantons are generated from the\nbasic one by the action of the conformal group SL(2, H) of S 4 . Elements of the subgroup\nSp(2) \u2282 SL(2, H) leave invariant the basic one, hence to get new instantons one needs\nto quotient SL(2, H) by the spin group Sp(2) \u2243 Spin(5). The resulting moduli space\nof SU(2) instantons on S 4 modulo gauge transformations is identified (cf. [1]) with the\nfive-dimensional quotient manifold SL(2, H)/Sp(2).\nIn a parallel attempt to generate instantons on A(S\u03b84 ), we construct a quantum group\nSL\u03b8 (2, H) and its quantum subgroup Sp\u03b8 (2). An infinitesimal construction was proposed\nin [15] where a deformed dual enveloping algebra U\u03b8 (so(5, 1)) was used to generate infinitesimal instantons by acting on the basic instanton described above.\nThe construction of Hopf algebras A(SL\u03b8 (2, H)) and A(Sp\u03b8 (2)) is a special case of the\nquantization of compact Lie groups using Rieffel's strategy in [18], and studied for the\ntoric noncommutative geometries in [21]. Firstly, a deformed (Moyal-type) product \u00d7\u03b8\nis constructed on the algebra of (continuous) functions A(G) on a compact Lie group G,\nstarting with an action of a closed connected abelian subgroup of G (usually a torus).\nThe algebra A(G) equipped with the deformed product is denoted by A(G\u03b8 ). Keeping\nthe classical expression of the coproduct, counit and antipode on A(G), but now on the\nalgebra A(G\u03b8 ), the latter becomes a Hopf algebra. It is in duality with a deformation\nof the universal enveloping algebra U(g) of the Lie algebra g of G. The Hopf algebra\nU(g) is deformed to U\u03b8 (g) by leaving unchanged the algebra structure while twisting the\ncoproduct, counit and antipode. The deformation from U(g) to U\u03b8 (g) is implemented\nwith a twist of Drinfel'd type [9, 10] \u2013 in fact, explicitly constructed in [16] for the cases\nat hand \u2013 as revived in [19].\nThe deformed enveloping algebra U\u03b8 (so(5, 1)) was explicitly constructed in [15]. We\nnow briefly discuss the dual construction for the Lie group SL(2, H). The torus T2 is\nembedded in SL(2, H) diagonally,\n\u0001\n\u03c1(t) = diag e2\u03c0it1 , e2\u03c0it2 ,\nfor t = (t1 , t2 ) \u2208 T2 ,\nand the group T2 \u00d7 T2 acts on SL(2, H) by\n\n(s, t, g) \u2208 T2 \u00d7 T2 \u00d7 SL(2, H) 7\u2192 \u03c1(s) * g * \u03c1(t)\u22121 \u2208 SL(2, H).\n\n(3.1)\n\nSimilar to P\nthe case of the spheres in Sect. 2, any function f \u2208 A(SL(2, H)) expands in a\nseries f = r fr of homogeneous elements for this action of T4 , but now r = (r1 , r2 , r3 , r4 )\n5\n\n\fis a multidegree taking values in Z4 . A deformed product \u00d7\u03b8 is defined by an analogue\nof formula (2.10) on homogeneous elements:\nfr \u00d7\u03b8 gs = e\u03c0i\u03b8(r1 s2 \u2212r2 s1 +r3 s4 \u2212r4 s3 ) fr gs ,\nand extended by linearity to the whole of A(SL(2, H)). The resulting deformed algebra\nA(SL\u03b8 (2, H)), endowed with the classical (expressions for the) coproduct \u2206, counit \u01eb and\nantipode S becomes a Hopf algebra.\nIn fact, to avoid problems coming from the noncommutativity of quaternions, we shall\nthink of elements in H as 2 by 2 matrices over C via the natural inclusion\n\u0012\n\u0013\nc1 c2\nH \u220b q = c1 + c2 j 7\u2192\n\u2208 Mat2 (C),\nfor c1 , c2 \u2208 C.\n\u2212c2 c1\nIn the present paper, we need not only the Hopf algebra A(SL\u03b8 (2, H)) but also its\ncoaction on the principal bundle A(S\u03b84 ) \u0592\u2192 A(S\u03b87 ), and in turn on the basic instanton\nconnection (2.9) on the bundle, in order to generate new instantons. Having this fact in\nmind we proceed to give an explicit construction of A(SL\u03b8 (2, H)) out of its coaction in a\nway that also shows its quaternionic nature.\n\n3.1\n\nThe quantum group SL\u03b8 (2, H)\n\nFor the deformation of the quaternionic special linear group SL(2, H), we start from\nthe algebra of a two-dimensional deformed quaternionic space H2\u03b8 . Let A(C4\u03b8 ) be the\n\u2217-algebra generated by elements {zj , zj\u2217 ; a = 1, . . . , 4} with the relations as in equation\n(2.1) (for the specific value of the deformation parameter \u03bb considered in Sect. 2 and\nobtained from (2.8) as mentioned there) but without the spherical relation that defines\nA(S\u03b87 ). We take A(H2\u03b8 ) to be the algebra A(C4\u03b8 ) equipped with the antilinear \u2217-algebra\nmap j : A(C4\u03b8 ) \u2192 A(C4\u03b8 ) defined on generators by\nj : (z1 , z2 , z3 , z4 ) 7\u2192 (z2 , \u2212z1 , z4 , \u2212z3 ).\nIt is worth stressing that this deformation of the quaternions takes place between the two\ncopies of H while leaving the quaternionic structure within each copy of H undeformed.\nSince the second column of the matrix u in (2.3) is the image through j of the first one,\nwe may think of u as made of two deformed quaternions.\nFollowing a general strategy [22], we now define A(M\u03b8 (2, H)) to be the universal bialgebra for which A(H2\u03b8 ) is a comodule \u2217-algebra. More precisely, we define a transformation\nbialgebra of A(H2\u03b8 ) to be a bialgebra B such that there is a \u2217-algebra map\n\u2206L : A(C4\u03b8 ) \u2192 B \u2297 A(C4\u03b8 ),\nwhich satisfies\n(id \u2297 j) \u25e6 \u2206L = \u2206L \u25e6 j.\n\n(3.2)\n\nWe then set A(M\u03b8 (2, H)) to be the universal transformation bialgebra in the following\nsense: for any transformation bialgebra B there exists a morphism of transformation\nbialgebras (i.e. commuting with the coactions) from A(M\u03b8 (2, H)) onto B.\n6\n\n\fThe requirement that A(H2\u03b8 ) be a A(M\u03b8 (2, H))-comodule algebra allows us to derive\nthe commutation relations of the latter. A coaction \u2206L is given by matrix multiplication,\n.\n\n\u2206L : (z1 , \u2212z2\u2217 , z3 , \u2212z4\u2217 )t 7\u2192 A\u03b8 \u2297 (z1 , \u2212z2\u2217 , z3 , \u2212z4\u2217 )t ,\n\n(3.3)\n\nfor a generic 4 \u00d7 4 matrix A\u03b8 = (Aij ). Asking for (3.2) we have\n(Ajk )\u2217 = (\u22121)j+k Aj \u2032 k\u2032 ,\nwith j \u2032 = j + (\u22121)j+1 and the same for k \u2032 ; this means that\n\uf8eb\na1 a2 b1\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\uf8ec\n\u2212a\u22172 a\u22171 \u2212b\u22172\naij bij\n=\uf8ec\nA\u03b8 =\n\uf8ed c1 c2 d 1\ncij dij\n\u2212c\u22172 c\u22171 \u2212d\u22172\n\nA\u03b8 has the form\n\uf8f6\nb2\nb\u22171 \uf8f7\n\uf8f7 .\nd2 \uf8f8\nd\u22171\n\nWe use 'quaternion notations' for the above matrix and write\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0012\na1 a2\na b\n,\n,\nwith a = (aij ) =\nA\u03b8 =\n\u2212a\u22172 a\u22171\nc d\n\n(3.4)\n\n(3.5)\n\nand similarly for the remaining parts.\nThe defining matrix in (3.4) has a 'classical form'. One readily finds that with respect\nto the torus action (3.1) its entries Aij are of multidegree \u039bi \u2295 (\u2212\u039bj ) in Z4 with\n\u0001\n\u039b = (\u039bi ) = (1, 0), (\u22121, 0), (0, 1), (0, \u22121) .\n\nThe general strategy exemplified by the deformed product (2.10) would then give the\ndeformed product and in turn, the commutation relations defining the deformed algebra\nA(M\u03b8 (2, H)). We shall get them directly from the coaction on the algebra A(C4\u03b8 ).\nThe transformations induced on the generators of A(C4\u03b8 ) reads\nw1 := \u2206L (z1 ) = a1 \u2297 z1 \u2212 a2 \u2297 z2\u2217 + b1 \u2297 z3 \u2212 b2 \u2297 z4\u2217\nw2 := \u2206L (z2 ) = a1 \u2297 z2 + a2 \u2297 z1\u2217 + b1 \u2297 z4 + b2 \u2297 z3\u2217\nw3 := \u2206L (z3 ) = c1 \u2297 z1 \u2212 c2 \u2297 z2\u2217 + d1 \u2297 z3 \u2212 d2 \u2297 z4\u2217\nw4 := \u2206L (z4 ) = c1 \u2297 z2 + c2 \u2297 z1\u2217 + d1 \u2297 z4 + d2 \u2297 z3\u2217\n\n(3.6)\n\nwith \u2206L (zj\u2217 ) = (\u2206L (zj ))\u2217 . The condition for \u2206L to be an algebra map determines the\ncommutation relations among the generators of A(M\u03b8 (2, H)): the algebra generated by\nthe aij is commutative, as well as the algebras generated by the bij , cij and the dij .\nHowever, the whole algebra is not commutative and there are relations. A straightforward\ncomputation allows one to concisely write them as\nAij Akl = \u03b7ki \u03b7jl Akl Aij\n\n(3.7)\n\nwith \u03b7 = (\u03b7ki ) the deformation matrix in (2.8). Indeed, imposing that (3.3) defines\na \u2217-algebra map on the generators of A(C4\u03b8 ), and using the relations (2.7), we have\nP\nkl (Aik Ajl \u2212 \u03b7ji \u03b7kl Ajl Aik ) \u2297 uka ulb = 0. Since for a \u2264 b the elements uka ulb could be\ntaken to be all independent, relations Aik Ajl \u2212 \u03b7ji \u03b7kl Ajl Aik = 0 hold, for all values of a, b.\n7\n\n\fAn explicit expression of the above commutation relations is in App. A. It is not\ndifficult to see that A(M\u03b8 (2, H)) is indeed the universal transformation bialgebra, since\nthe commutation relations (3.7) and the quaternionic structure of A\u03b8 in (3.4) are derived\nfrom the minimal requirement of \u2206L to be a \u2217-algebra map such that (3.2) holds.\nIn order to define the quantum group SL\u03b8 (2, H) we need a determinant. This is most\nnaturally introduced via the coaction on forms. There is a natural differential calculus\n\u03a9(C4\u03b8 ) generated in degree 1 by elements {dzj , a = 1, . . . , 4} and relations\nzj dzk \u2212 \u03bbjk dzk zj = 0,\n\ndzj dzk + \u03bbjk dzk dzj = 0,\n\nzj dzk\u2217 \u2212 \u03bbkj dzk\u2217 zj = 0,\n\nzj\u2217 dzk \u2212 \u03bbkj dzk zj\u2217 = 0,\n\ndzj dzk\u2217 + \u03bbkj dzk\u2217 dzj = 0.\n\ntogether with their conjugates. The forms \u03a9(C4\u03b8 ) could be obtained from the general\nprocedure mentioned at the end of Sect. 2. The result is also isomorphic to the one\nobtained from the general construction [6] which uses the Dirac operator to implement\nthe exterior derivative as a commutator.\nThe coaction \u2206L is extended to forms by requiring it to commute with d. Having the\naction (3.3), it is natural to define a determinant element by setting\n\u2206L (dz1 dz2\u2217 dz3 dz4\u2217 ) =: det(A\u03b8 ) \u2297 dz1 dz2\u2217 dz3 dz4\u2217 .\nWe find its explicit form by using the relations of \u03a9(C4\u03b8 ):\ndet(A\u03b8 ) = a1 [a\u22171 (d1 d\u22171 + d2 d\u22172 ) + b\u22172 (\u03bcc2 d\u22171 \u2212 d2 c\u22171 ) \u2212 b\u22171 (\u03bcc2 d\u22172 + d1 c\u22171 )]\n\u2212 a2 [\u2212a\u22172 (d1 d\u22171 + d2 d\u22172 ) + b\u22172 (\u03bcc1 d\u22171 + d2 c\u22172 ) + b\u22171 (\u2212\u03bcc1 d\u22172 + d1 c\u22172 )]\n+ b1 [\u2212a\u22172 (c2 d\u22171 \u2212 \u03bcd2 c\u22171 ) \u2212 a\u22171 (c1 d\u22171 + \u03bcd2 c\u22172 ) + b\u22171 (c1 c\u22171 + c2 c\u22172 )]\n\u2212 b2 [a\u22172 (c2 d\u22172 + \u03bcd1c\u22171 ) + a\u22171 (c1 d\u22172 \u2212 \u03bcd1 c\u22172 ) \u2212 b\u22172 (c1 c\u22171 + c2 c\u22172 )].\nA more compact form for det(A\u03b8 ) is found to be (see also App. B)\nX\n(\u22121)|\u03c3| \u03b5\u03c3 A1,\u03c3(1) A2,\u03c3(2) A3,\u03c3(3) A4,\u03c3(4) ,\ndet(A\u03b8 ) =\n\n(3.8)\n\n(3.9)\n\n\u03c3\u2208S4\n\nwith \u03b5\u03c3 = \u03b5\u03c3(1)\u03c3(2)\u03c3(3)\u03c3(4) . The tensor \u03b5ijkl has components\n\u03b51324 = \u03b5cycl = \u03bc ;\n\n\u03b51423 = \u03b5cycl = \u03bc,\n\nand equal to 1 otherwise. In the limit \u03b8 \u2192 0, the element det(A\u03b8 ) reduces to the\ndeterminant of the matrix A\u03b8=0 as it should. Additional results on the determinant\nare in the following lemmata.\nLemma 3.1. For each i, l \u2208 {1, . . . , 4}, define the corresponding algebraic complement:\nX\n(\u22121)|\u03c3| \u03b5\u03c31 ...\u03c3i\u22121 l\u03c3i+1 ...\u03c34 \u03b7 \u03c31 l \u03b7 \u03c32 l * * * \u03b7 \u03c3i\u22121 l A1,\u03c31 . . .

Then,\nAil \u00c2il = \u00c2il Ail\n\nfor any i and l.\n8\n\n\fProof.

Similarly for the other coefficient given by the product of\nthe elements of the l-th row.\nLemma 3.2. The determinant det(A\u03b8 ) is computed via a Laplace expansion:\nP\n1. by rows; for each i \u2208 {1, . . . , 4} fixed:\ndet(A\u03b8 ) = l (\u22121)i+l Ail \u00c2il ;\nP\n2. by columns; for each i \u2208 {1, . . . , 4} fixed:\ndet(A\u03b8 ) = l (\u22121)i+l Ali \u00c2li .\n\nProof. These follow from (3.7) after a lengthy but straightforward computation.\n\nThe particular form of the deformation matrix \u03b7ij defining the relations in A(S\u03b87 )\nimplies that det(A\u03b8 ) is (not surprisingly) a central element in the algebra A(M\u03b8 (2, H))\ngenerated by the entries of A\u03b8 . Hence we can take the quotient of this algebra by the\ntwo-sided ideal generated by det(A\u03b8 ) \u2212 1; we will denote this quotient by A(SL\u03b8 (2, H)).\nThe image of the elements Aij in the quotient algebra will again be denoted by Aij .\nIn order to have a quantum group we need more structure. On the algebra A(SL\u03b8 (2, H))\nwe define a coproduct by\nX\n\u2206(Aij ) :=\nAik \u2297 Akj ,\nk\n\na counit by\n\n\u01eb(Aij ) := \u03b4ij ,\nwhereas the antipode S is defined by\nS(Aij ) := (\u22121)i+j \u00c2ji .\nHere\ncomplements introduced in Lemma 3.1. Indeed, from Lemma 3.2,\nP \u00c2li are the algebraic\nP\ni+l\nA\nS(A\n)\n=\n(\u22121)\nAil \u00c2il = det(A\u03b8 ) = 1, and similarly, using also Lemma 3.1,\nli\nPl il\nPl\nP\ni+l\n\u00c2li Ali = det(A\u03b8 ) = 1. Moreover, if i 6= j, l Ail S(Alj ) = 0 as\nl S(Ail )Ali =\nl (\u22121)\none shows by explicit computation.\nThe definitions above are collected in the following proposition.\nProposition 3.3. The datum (A(SL\u03b8 (2, H)), \u2206, \u01eb, S) constitutes a Hopf algebra.\nThe coaction \u2206L in (3.3) passes to a coaction of P\nA(SL\u03b8 (2, H)) on A(H2\u03b8 ) and it is\nstill a \u2217-algebra map. However, the spherical relation j zj\u2217 zj = 1 is no longer invariant\nunder \u2206L . Thus, the algebra A(S\u03b87 ) is not an A(SL\u03b8 (2, H))-comodule algebra but only a\nA(SL\u03b8 (2, H))-comodule. We shall elaborate more on this in Sect. 4 below.\n9\n\n\f3.2\n\nThe quantum group Sp\u03b8 (2)\n\nMotivated by the classical picture we next introduce the symplectic group A(Sp\u03b8 (2)).\nRecall that a two-sided \u2217-ideal I in a Hopf algebra (A, \u2206, \u01eb, S) is a Hopf ideal if\n\u2206(I) \u2286 I \u2297 A + A \u2297 I,\n\n\u01eb(I) = 0,\n\nS(I) \u2286 I.\n\n(3.10)\n\nThen the quotient A/I is a Hopf algebra with induced structures ((\u03c0 \u2297 \u03c0) \u25e6 \u2206, \u01eb, \u03c0 \u25e6 S),\nwhere \u03c0 : A \u2192 A/I is the natural projection.\nProposition\nP 3.4.\u2217 Let I denote the two-sided \u2217-ideal in A(SL\u03b8 (2, H)) generated by the\nelements k (Aki ) Akj \u2212 \u03b4ij for i, j = 1, . . . , 4. Then I \u2282 A(SL\u03b8 (2, H)) is a Hopf ideal.\n\nProof. The first two conditions in (3.10) follow easily from the definition of \u2206 and \u01eb\nfor A(SL\u03b8 (2, H)) in Proposition 3.3. For the third, we observe that if J is an ideal in\nA(SL\u03b8 (2, H)) such that the classical counterpart J (0) is an ideal in A(SL(2, H)) which is\ngenerated by homogeneous elements, then J = J (0) as vector spaces. Indeed, the deformed\nproduct of a generator with any homogeneous function merely results in multiplication\nby\nP\na complex phase. In our case, the classical counterparts for the generators k (Aki )\u2217 Akj \u2212\n\u03b4ij are indeed homogeneous (if i = j, they are of bidegree (0, 0), otherwise of bidegree\n\u039bi \u2212 \u039bj ) and the above applies. In particular, S(I) = S(I (0) ) \u2286 I (0) = I.\n\nCorollary 3.5. The quotient A(Sp\u03b8 (2)) := A(SL\u03b8 (2, H))/I is a Hopf algebra with the\ninduced Hopf algebra structure.\nWe still use the symbols (\u2206, \u01eb, S) for the induced structures. The 'defining matrix' A\u03b8\nof A(Sp\u03b8 (2)) has the form (3.4) (or (3.5)) with the additional condition that A\u2217\u03b8 A\u03b8 = 1,\ncoming from the very definition of A(Sp\u03b8 (2)). A little algebra shows also that A\u03b8 A\u2217\u03b8 = 1.\nThese conditions are equivalent to the statement that S(A\u03b8 ) = A\u2217\u03b8 . In the quaternionic\nform, the conditions A\u2217\u03b8 A\u03b8 = A\u03b8 A\u2217\u03b8 = 1 becomes\n\u0013\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013 \u0012 \u2217\n\u0012 \u2217\n1 0\naa + bb\u2217 ac\u2217 + bd\u2217\na a + c\u2217 c a\u2217 b + c\u2217 d\n.\n=\n=\n0 1\nca\u2217 + db\u2217 cc\u2217 + dd\u2217\nb\u2217 a + d\u2217 c b\u2217 b + d\u2217 d\n\n3.3\n\nThe quantum homogeneous spaces A(S\u03b87) and A(S\u03b84 )\n\nUsing the same notations as in (3.4), let us consider the two sided ideal in A(Sp\u03b8 (2))\ngiven by I\u03b8 := hbij , cij , a2 , a\u22172 , a1 \u2212 1, a\u22171 \u2212 1i. This is a \u2217-Hopf ideal, that is,\n\u2206(I\u03b8 ) \u2286 A(Sp\u03b8 (2)) \u2297 I\u03b8 + I\u03b8 \u2297 A(Sp\u03b8 (2)) ,\n\n\u03b5(I\u03b8 ) = 0 ,\n\nS(I\u03b8 ) \u2286 I\u03b8 ,\n\nand we can take the quotient Hopf algebra A(Sp\u03b8 (1)) := A(Sp\u03b8 (2))/I\u03b8 with corresponding\nprojection map \u03c0I\u03b8 . By projecting with \u03c0I\u03b8 , the algebra reduces to the commutative one\ngenerated by the entries of the diagonal matrix \u03c0I\u03b8 (A\u03b8 ) = diag(I2 , dij ) = diag(I2 , d), with\nd\u2217 d = dd\u2217 = I2 or d1 d\u22171 + d2 d\u22172 = 1; hence, A(Sp\u03b8 (1)) = A(Sp(1)).

An algebra isomorphism between the algebra\n10\n\n\fof coinvariants and A(S\u03b87 ) is provided by the \u2217-map sending these columns to the matrix\nu in (2.3). On the generators this is given by\na1 7\u2192 z1 ,\n\na2 7\u2192 z2 ,\n\nc1 7\u2192 z3 ,\n\nc2 7\u2192 z4\n\n(3.11)\n\nP\nand the spherical relation corresponds to the condition (A\u2217\u03b8 A\u03b8 )11 = (a\u2217i ai + c\u2217i ci ) = 1.\nSummarizing, we have that A(Sp\u03b8 (2))co(A(Sp(1)) \u2243 A(S\u03b87). It follows from the general\ntheory of noncommutative principal bundles over quantum homogeneous spaces [4] that\nthe inclusion A(S\u03b87 ) \u0592\u2192 A(Sp\u03b8 (2)) is a noncommutative principal bundle with the classical\ngroup Sp(1) as structure group.\nNext, we consider the ideal in A(Sp\u03b8 (2)) given by J\u03b8 := hbij , cij i, \u2013 again easily\nshown to be a Hopf ideal. Denote by \u03c0J\u03b8 the projection map onto the quotient Hopf\nalgebra A(Sp\u03b8 (2))/J\u03b8 generated, as an algebra, by the entries of \u03c0J\u03b8 (A\u03b8 ) = diag(aij , dij ) =\ndiag(a, d). The conditions A\u2217\u03b8 A\u03b8 = A\u03b8 A\u2217\u03b8 = 1 give that both {aij } and {dij } generate a\ncopy of the algebra A(Sp(1)). However, from the explicit relations in App. A we see that\nin general aij dmn 6= dmn aij and the quotient algebra is not commutative.\nThe algebra of coinvariants for the right coaction (id \u2297 \u03c0J\u03b8 ) \u25e6 \u2206 of \u03c0J\u03b8 (A(Sp\u03b8 (2))) on\n.\nA(Sp\u03b8 (2)), is A(S\u03b84 ). Indeed, with the map (id \u2297 \u03c0J\u03b8 ) \u25e6 \u2206 : A\u03b8 7\u2192 A\u03b8 \u2297 \u03c0J\u03b8 (A\u03b8 ) given by\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0012 .\n\u0012\n.\na\u2297a b\u2297d\na b\n.\n.\n,\n7\u2192\nc d\nc\u2297a d\u2297d\n\none finds that the \u2217-algebra of coinvariants is generated by the elements\n(aa\u2217 )11 = a1 a\u22171 + a2 a\u22172 ,\n\n(ca\u2217 )11 = c1 a\u22171 + c2 a\u22172 ,\n\n(ca\u2217 )12 = \u2212c1 a2 + c2 a1 .\n\nThe \u2217-map (3.11) combined with (2.6) then provides the identification with the generators\nof A(S\u03b84 ). Again, the general theory of noncommutative principal bundles over quantum\nhomogeneous spaces of [4] gives that the inclusion A(S\u03b84 ) \u0592\u2192 A(Sp\u03b8 (2)) is a noncommutative principal bundle with \u03c0J\u03b8 (A(Sp\u03b8 (2)) as structure group. It is a deformation of the\nprincipal bundle over S 4 with total space Sp(2) and structure group Sp(1) \u00d7 Sp(1).\n\n4\n\nNoncommutative conformal transformations\n\nThere is a natural coaction \u2206L of A(SL\u03b8 (2, H)) on the SU(2) noncommutative principal\nfibration A(S\u03b84 ) \u0592\u2192 A(S\u03b87 ) of Sect. 2. Since the matrix u in (2.3) consists of two deformed\nquaternions, the left coaction \u2206L of A(SL\u03b8 (2, H)) in (3.6) can be written on A(S\u03b87 ) as\n\u2206L : A(S\u03b87 ) \u2192 A(SL\u03b8 (2, H)) \u2297 A(S\u03b87 ),\nor, in components,\nuia 7\u2192 u\neia := \u2206L (uia ) =\n\n.\n\nu 7\u2192 u\ne := \u2206L (u) = A\u03b8 \u2297 u,\n\nX\n\nj\n\nAij \u2297 uja.\n\n(4.1)\n\n(4.2)\n\nWe have already mentioned that the left coaction\nP \u2206\u2217L of A(SL\u03b8 (2, H)) as in (3.6) does\nnot leave invariant the spherical relation: \u2206L ( j zj zj ) 6= 1 \u2297 1. We will denote by\nA(Se7 ) the image of A(S 7 ) under the left coaction of A(SL\u03b8 (2, H)): it is a subalgebra of\n\u03b8\n\n\u03b8\n\n11\n\n\fA(SL\u03b8 (2, H)) \u2297P\nA(S\u03b87 ). We think of A(Se\u03b87) as a \u03b8-deformation of a family of 'inflated'\nspheres. Since j zj\u2217 zj is central in A(S\u03b87 ) its image\nX\n\u03c12 := \u2206L (\nzj\u2217 zj ),\n(4.3)\nj\n\nis a central element in A(Se\u03b87 ) that parametrizes a family of noncommutative 7-spheres\n7\nSe\u03b87 . By evaluating \u03c12 as any real number r 2 \u2208 R, we obtain an algebra A(S\u03b8,r\n) which is\na deformation of the algebra of polynomials on a sphere of radius r.\nRemark 4.1. As expected, the coaction of the quantum subgroup A(Sp\u03b8 (2)) does not\n'inflate the spheres', i.e. \u03c12 = 1 \u2297 1 in this case. Indeed, if A\u03b8 = (Aij ) is the defining\nmatrix of A(Sp\u03b8 (2)), one gets\nX\nX\n(u\u2217 u)ab 7\u2192\n(A\u2217 )li Aij \u2297 (u\u2217 )al ujb =\n\u03b4lj \u2297 (u\u2217 )al ujb = 1 \u2297 (u\u2217 u)ab ,\nijl\n\nP\n\njl\n\nP\n\n\u2217\n\u2217\n7\n4\nwhich gives\nj zj zj 7\u2192 1 \u2297\nj zj zj . Hence, both A(S\u03b8 ) and A(S\u03b8 ) are A(Sp\u03b8 (2))comodule \u2217-algebras. Using the identification (3.11) one sees that the coaction of A(Sp\u03b8 (2))\non A(S\u03b87 ) is the restriction of the coproduct of A(Sp\u03b8 (2)) to the first column of A\u03b8 , i.e.\nto the algebra of coinvariants A(Sp\u03b8 (2))co(A(Sp(1)) .\n\nNext, we define a right action of SU(2) on A(Se\u03b87 ) in such a way that the corresponding\nalgebra of invariants describes a family of noncommutative 4-spheres. It is natural to\nrequire that the above left coaction of A(SL\u03b8 (2, H)) on A(S\u03b87) intertwines the right action\nof SU(2) on A(Se\u03b87 ) with the action of SU(2) on A(S\u03b87 ).\nThe algebra A(Se\u03b87 ) is generated by elements {wj , wj\u2217P\n, j = 1, . . . , 4}, the wj 's being as\nin (3.6) but with 'coefficients' in A(SL\u03b8 (2, H)). Clearly, j wj\u2217 wj = \u03c12 . Then, the algebra\nof invariants of the action of SU(2) on A(Se\u03b87) is generated by\nx\ne = w1 w1\u2217 + w2 w2\u2217 \u2212 w3 w3\u2217 \u2212 w4 w4\u2217 ,\n\u03b1\ne = 2(w1 w \u2217 + w2 w \u2217 ) ,\n\u03b2e = 2(\u2212w1 w4 + w2 w3 ) ,\n3\n\n4\n\n(4.4)\n\ntogether with \u03c12 . This is so because the elements (4.4) are the images under the map\n\u2206L of the elements (2.6) that generate the algebra of invariants under the action of\nSU(2) on A(S\u03b87 ). This correspondence also gives for their commutation relations the\nsame expressions as the ones in (2.2) for the generators of A(S\u03b84 ). The difference is that\nwe do not have the spherical relation of A(S\u03b84 ) any longer but rather we find that\nX\n\u00012\n\u03b1\ne\u2217 \u03b1\ne + \u03b2e\u2217 \u03b2e + x\ne2 =\nwj\u2217 wj = \u03c14 .\n(4.5)\nj\n\nWe denote by A(Se\u03b84 ) \u2282 A(SL\u03b8 (2, H)) \u2297 A(S\u03b84) the algebra of invariants and conclude\nthat the coaction \u2206L of A(SL\u03b8 (2, H)) on the SU(2) principal fibration A(S\u03b84 ) \u0592\u2192 A(S\u03b87 )\ngenerates a family of SU(2) principal fibrations A(Se\u03b84 ) \u0592\u2192 A(Se\u03b87). Evaluating the central\n4\n7\nelement \u03c12 , for any r \u2208 R we get an SU(2) principal fibration A(S\u03b8,r\n) \u0592\u2192 A(S\u03b8,r\n) of\n2\nspheres of radius r and r respectively.\nMotivated by the interpretation of the Hopf algebra SL\u03b8 (2, H) as a parameter space\n(see Sect. 5), the coaction of A(SL\u03b8 (2, H)) is extended to the forms \u03a9(S\u03b84 ) by requiring\n12\n\n\fthat it commutes with d, i.e. \u2206L (d\u03c9) = (id \u2297 d)\u2206L (\u03c9), thus extending the differential\nof A(S\u03b84) to A(SL\u03b8 (2, H)) \u2297 A(S\u03b84 ) as (id \u2297 d). Having these, we have the following\ncharacterization of A(SL\u03b8 (2, H)) as conformal transformations.\nProposition 4.2. With \u2217\u03b8 the natural Hodge operator on S\u03b84 , the algebra A(SL\u03b8 (2, H))\ncoacts by conformal transformations on \u03a9(S\u03b84 ), that is\n\u2206L (\u2217\u03b8 \u03c9) = (id \u2297 \u2217\u03b8 )\u2206L (\u03c9) ,\n\n\u2200 \u03c9 \u2208 \u03a9(S\u03b84 ) .\n\nProof. The map \u2206L is given by the classical coaction of A(SL(2, H)) on \u03a9(S 4 ) as vector\nspaces and only the two products on A(SL(2, H)) and \u03a9(S 4 ) are deformed. Since \u2217\u03b8\ncoincides with the undeformed Hodge operator \u2217 on \u03a9(S\u03b84 ) \u2243 \u03a9(S 4 ) as vector spaces, the\nresult follows from the fact that SL(2, H) acts by conformal transformations on S 4 .\n\n4.1\n\nThe quantum group SO\u03b8 (5, 1)\n\nex\nBy construction, the generators \u03b1\ne, \u03b2,\ne of A(Se\u03b84 ) are the images under \u2206L of the corresponding \u03b1, \u03b2, x of A(S\u03b84 ).

We denote this by A(SO\u03b8 (5, 1)), a notation that will become clear presently.\nIn A(C4\u03b8 ), let us consider the vector-valued function X := (r, x, \u03b1, \u03b1\u2217, \u03b2, \u03b2 \u2217)t , with\nr := z1 z1\u2217 + z2 z2\u2217 + z3 z3\u2217 + z4 z4\u2217 and x, \u03b1, \u03b2 are the quadratic elements, with the same\nformal expression as in (2.6), but with the z\u03bc 's in A(C4\u03b8 ) (that is we do not impose any\nspherical relations).

In order to simplify computations for this, we shall rearrange the\ngenerators and use, instead of X, the vector\nY = (\u03c012 , \u03c034 , \u03c014 , \u03c023 , \u03c013 , \u03c024 ),\nwhere the \u03c0ij 's are the 2-minors of the matrix u in (2.3):\n\u03c0ij := ui1 uj2 \u2212 ui2 uj1 ,\n\ni < j , i, j = 1, . . . 4 .\n\nThe relations with the Xi 's are\nX1 = Y1 + Y2 , X2 = Y1 \u2212 Y2 , X3 = 2Y3 ,\nX4 = \u22122\u03bc Y4 , X5 = \u22122Y5 , X6 = \u22122\u03bc Y6 .\nOn the generators \u03c0ij 's, the coaction \u2206L in (4.2) simply reads\nX\n\u03c0ij 7\u2192 \u2206L (\u03c0ij ) =\nmij ls \u2297 \u03c0ls ,\nl,s=1...4\n\nl<s\n\n14\n\n\fwith the m's given by the 2-minors of the matrix A\u03b8 :\nmij ls = Ail Ajs \u2212 \u03b7ls Ais Ajl ,\n\nl < s ,i < j .\n\n(4.10)\n\nWith the generators \u03c0ij 's the condition X t gX = 0 translates to\n\u03c012 \u03c034 + \u03bc \u03c014 \u03c023 \u2212 \u03bc \u03c013 \u03c024 = 0 ,\n\n(4.11)\n\nwhich, at the classical value of the deformation parameter, \u03bc = \u03bb = 1, is the Pl\u00fccker\nquadric [1]. In turn, by rewriting the metric, this condition can be written as\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0013 \u0012\n\u0012\u0012\n\u0013\u0013\n\u0001 1\n0 \u2212\u03bc\n0 \u03bc\n0 1\nt\n1 IJ\nY hY = 0 , with h = 2 h\n,\n,\n= 2 diag\n. (4.12)\n\u2212\u03bc 0\n\u03bc 0\n1 0\nHere and in the following we use capital letters to denote indices\nI \u2208 {1 = (12), 2 = (34), 3 = (14), 4 = (23), 5 = (13), 6 = (24)}.\nThe statement in (4.9) that C\u03b8 t g C\u03b8 = g is equivalent to the following proposition\nwhose proof is given in App. B.\nProposition 4.3. The minors in (4.10) and the metric in (4.12) satisfy the condition,\nX\nhIJ mI K mJ L = hKL .\nIJ\n\nThe second relevant property of the matrix C\u03b8 concerns its determinant. An element det(C\u03b8 ) can be defined using a differential calculus, now on A(R5,1\n\u03b8 ) (with relations\ndictated by those in A(S\u03b84 ) except for the spherical relation) as\n\u2206L (dX1 * * * dX6 ) = det(C\u03b8 ) \u2297 dX1 * * * dX6 .\nOne expects that det(C\u03b8 ) can be expressed in terms of det(A\u03b8 ) as defined in (3.8) and\nthat it should indeed be equal to 1. Instead of checking this via a direct computation, we\nobserve that dX1 * * * dX6 is a central element in the differential calculus on A(R5,1\n\u03b8 ) and\nhas a classical limit which is invariant under the torus action. In the framework of the\ndeformation described at the end of Sect. 2 the result of \u2206L on it remains undeformed\nand coincides with the classical coaction of A(SO(5, 1)) giving indeed det(C\u03b8 ) = 1.\nRemark 4.4. With the two properties above, the algebra A(SO\u03b8 (5, 1)) could have been\ndefined without reference to A(SL\u03b8 (2, H)). The entries of the matrix\nP C\u03b8 are its generators\nwith relations derived as in Sect. 3.1 by imposing that Xi 7\u2192 j Cij \u2297 Xj respects the\ncommutation relations of A(S\u03b84 ), except the spherical relation. In addition, one imposes\nthe conditions C\u03b8t gC\u03b8 = g and det(C\u03b8 ) = 1. Of course, this algebra is isomorphic to\nthe Hopf subalgebra of Z2 -invariants in A(SL\u03b8 (2, H)) discussed above. It could also be\nobtained along the lines of [18, 21] (see also the beginning of Sect. 3) by deforming the\nproduct on A(SO(5, 1)) with respect to the adjoint action of the torus T2 \u2282 SO(5, 1).\n\n15\n\n\f5\n\nA noncommutative family of instantons on S\u03b84\n\nWe mentioned in Sect. 2 that out of the matrix valued function u in (2.3) one gets a\nprojection p = u\u2217 u, given explicitly in (2.5), whose Grassmannian connection \u2207 = p \u25e6 d\nhas self-dual curvature: \u2217\u03b8 \u22072 = \u22072 . The corresponding instanton connection 1-form\n\u2013 acting on equivariant maps \u2013 is expressed in terms of u as well and it is an su(2)valued 1-form on S\u03b87 . Indeed, the A(S\u03b84 )-module E determined by p is isomorphic to the\nA(S\u03b84 )-module of equivariant maps for the defining representation \u03c0 of SU(2) on C2 :\n\b\nE \u2243 A(S\u03b87) \u22a0\u03c0 C2 := f \u2208 A(S\u03b87 ) \u2297 C2 : (id \u2297 \u03c0(g)\u22121)(f ) = (\u03b1g \u2297 id)(f ) ,\nP\nwhose elements we write f = a fa \u2297 ea by means of the standard basis {e1 , e2 } of C2 .\nThe connection \u2207 = p \u25e6 d : E \u2192 E \u2297A(S 4 ) \u03a9(S\u03b84 ) becomes on the equivariant maps:\n\u2207(fa ) = dfa +\n\nX\n\nb\n\n\u03c9ab fb ,\n\na, b = 1, 2,\n\nwhere the connection 1-form \u03c9 = (\u03c9ab ) is found to be given by\nX\n\u0001\n\u03c9ab = 12\n(u\u2217 )ak dukb \u2212 d(u\u2217 )ak ukb .\nk\n\n(5.1)\n\nP\nOne has \u03c9ab = \u2212(\u03c9 \u2217 )ba and a \u03c9aa = 0 so that \u03c9 is in \u03a91 (S\u03b87 ) \u2297 su(2).\nOut of the coaction of the quantum group SL\u03b8 (2, H) on the Hopf fibration on S\u03b84 , we\nshall get a family of such connections in the sense that we explain in the next sections.\n\n5.1\n\nA family of projections\n\nWe shall first describe a family of vector bundles over S\u03b84 . This is done by giving a family\nof suitable projections. We know from (4.1) or (4.2) the\nPtransformation of the matrix u\nto u\ne for the coaction of A(SL\u03b8 (2, H)): u\neia = \u2206L (uia ) = j Aij \u2297 uja , with A\u03b8 = (Aij ) the\ndefining matrix of A(SL\u03b8 (2, H)). The fact that the latter does not preserve the spherical\nrelations is also the statement that\n\u0010X\n\u0011\n\u0010X\n\u0011\nX\n(e\nu\u2217 )ak u\nekb = \u2206L\n(u\u2217 )ak ukb = \u2206L\nzk\u2217 zk \u03b4ab = \u03c12 \u03b4ab ,\n(5.2)\nk\n\nk\n\nk\n\nor (e\nu )\u2217 u\ne = \u03c12 I2 . Then, we define P = (Pij ) \u2208 Mat4 (A(Se\u03b84)) by\nX\nP := u\ne \u03c1\u22122 (e\nu)\u2217 ,\nor Pij = \u03c1\u22122\nu\neia (e\nu\u2217 )aj .\na\n\n(5.3)\n\nThe condition (e\nu)\u2217 u\ne = \u03c12 I2 gives that P is an idempotent; being \u2217-selfadjoint it is a\nprojection.\n\nRemark 5.1. For the above definition, we need to enlarge the algebra A(Se\u03b84 ) by adding\nthe extra element \u03c1\u22122 , the inverse of the positive p\nself-adjoint central element \u03c12 . In fact,\nwe shall also presently need the element \u03c1\u22121 = \u03c1\u22122 . At the smooth level this is not\nproblematic. The algebra C \u221e (Se\u03b84 ) can be defined as a fixed point algebra as in [7] and one\nfinds that the spectrum of \u03c12 is positive and does not contain the point 0.\n16\n\n\fExplicitly, one finds for the projection P the expression\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n\u03c12 + x\ne\n0\n\u03b1\ne\n\u03b2e\n\uf8f7\n1 \u22122 \uf8ec\n\u03c12 + x\ne \u2212\u03bc \u03b2e\u2217 \u03bc \u03b1\ne\u2217 \uf8f7\n\uf8ec 0\n\u03c1 \uf8ec \u2217\nP =\n\uf8f7,\n2\n\uf8ed \u03b1\ne\n0 \uf8f8\ne\n\u2212\u03bc \u03b2e \u03c12 \u2212 x\n\u03b2e\u2217\n\u03bc\u03b1\ne\n0\n\u03c12 \u2212 x\ne\n\na matrix strikingly similar to the matrix (2.5) for the basic projection. The entries of\nthe projection P are in A(Se\u03b84 ), that is A(SL\u03b8 (2, H)) \u2297 A(S\u03b84 ): we interpret P as a noncommutative family of projections parametrized by the noncommutative space SL\u03b8 (2, H).\nThis is the analogue for projections of the noncommutative families of maps that were\nintroduced and studied in [23, 20]. The interpretation as a noncommutative family is\njustified by the classical case: at \u03b8 = 0, there are evaluation maps evx : A(SL(2, H)) \u2192 C\nand for each point x in SL(2, H), (evx \u2297 id)P is a projection in Mat4 (A(S 4 )), that is a\nbundle over S 4 . Although there need not be enough evaluation maps available in the\nnoncommutative case, we can still work with the whole family at once.\nAs mentioned, we think of the Hopf algebra SL\u03b8 (2, H) as a parameter space and we\nextend to A(SL\u03b8 (2, H)) \u2297 A(S\u03b84 ) the differential of A(S\u03b84 ) as (id \u2297 d) (and similarly, the\nHodge star operator of A(S\u03b84 ) as (id \u2297 \u2217\u03b8 )). Having these, out of the projection P one\ngets a noncommutative family of instantons.\ne := P \u25e6 (id \u2297 d) has self-dual curvature\nProposition 5.2. The family of connections \u2207\ne 2 = P ((id \u2297 d)P )2 , that is,\n\u2207\n(id \u2297 \u2217\u03b8 )P ((id \u2297 d)P )2 = P ((id \u2297 d)P )2 .\n\nProof. From Proposition 4.2 we know that A(SL\u03b8 (2, H)) coacts by conformal transformae 2 = P ((id \u2297 d)P )2 is the image of the curvature p(dp)2 under\ntions and the curvature \u2207\nthe coaction of A(SL\u03b8 (2, H)).\nIt was shown in [8] that the charge of the basic instanton p is 1. This charge was given\nas a pairing between the second component of the Chern character of p \u2013 an element in\nthe cyclic homology group HC4 (A(S\u03b84 )) \u2013 with the fundamental class of S\u03b84 in the cyclic\ncohomology HC4 (A(S\u03b84 )). The zeroth and first components of the Chern character were\nshown to vanish identically in HC0 (A(S\u03b84 )) and HC2 (A(S\u03b84)), respectively. We will reduce\nthe computation of the Chern character for the family of projections P to this case by\nproving that P is equivalent to the projection 1\u2297p. Hence, we conclude that P represents\nthe same class as 1 \u2297 p in the K-theory of the algebra A(SL\u03b8 (2, H)) \u2297 A(S\u03b84 ).\nRecall that two projections p, q are Murray-von Neumann equivalent if there exists a\npartial isometry V such that p = V V \u2217 and q = V \u2217 V .\nLemma 5.3. The projection P is Murray-von Neumann equivalent to the projection 1\u2297p\nin the algebra M4 (A(SL\u03b8 (2, H)) \u2297 A(S\u03b84 )).\nProof. Define the matrix V = (Vik ) \u2208 M4 (A(SL\u03b8 (2, H)) \u2297 A(S\u03b84 )) by\nVik = \u03c1\u22121 Aij \u2297 pjk = \u03c1\u22121 Aij \u2297 uja (u\u2217 )ak = \u03c1\u22121 u\neia (1 \u2297 (u\u2217 )ak ),\n17\n\n\fwith \u0169 = (\u0169ia ) as in (4.1). For its adjoint, we have\n(V \u2217 )ik = \u03c1\u22121 (1 \u2297 uia )(e\nu\u2217 )ak .\nThen, using (5.2), one obtains\nX\nX\n(V \u2217 V )il =\n(V \u2217 )ik Vkl = \u03c1\u22122\n(1 \u2297 uia )(e\nu\u2217 )ak u\nekb(1 \u2297 (u\u2217 )bl )\nk\nkab\nX\nX\n= \u03c1\u22122\n(1 \u2297 uia )(\u03c12 \u03b4ab )(1 \u2297 (u\u2217 )bl ) = 1 \u2297\nuia (u\u2217 )al = 1 \u2297 pil ,\nab\n\na\n\nand\nX\n\nX\nVik (V \u2217 )kl = \u03c1\u22122\nu\neia (1 \u2297 (u\u2217 )ak )(1 \u2297 ukb)(e\nu\u2217 )bl\nk\nkab\nX\nX\n= \u03c1\u22122\nu\neia (1 \u2297 (u\u2217 )ak ukb)(e\nu\u2217 )bl = \u03c1\u22122\nu\neia (1 \u2297 \u03b4ab )(e\nu\u2217 )bl\nkab\nab\nX\n= \u03c1\u22122\nu\neia (e\nu\u2217 )al = Pil ,\n\n(V V \u2217 )il =\n\na\n\nwhich finishes the proof.\n\nIt follows from this lemma that the components chn (P ) \u2208 HC2n (A(SL\u03b8 (2, H)) \u2297 A(S\u03b84 )),\nwith n = 0, 1, 2, of the Chern character of P coincide with the pushforwards \u03c6\u2217 chn (p) of\nchn (p) \u2208 HC2n (A(S\u03b84 )) under the algebra map\n\u03c6 : A(S\u03b84) \u2192 A(SL\u03b8 (2, H)) \u2297 A(S\u03b84 ),\n\na 7\u2192 1 \u2297 a.\n\nAs a consequence, both ch0 (P ) and ch1 (P ) are zero since ch0 (p) and ch1 (p) vanish [8].\nNext, we would like to compute the charge of the family of instantons by pairing ch2 (P )\nwith the fundamental class [S\u03b84 ] \u2208 HC4 (A(S\u03b84 )); classically, this corresponds to an integration over S 4 giving a value 1 of the charge which is constant over SL(2, H). As\nsaid, the Chern character ch2 (P ) is an element in HC4 (A(SL\u03b8 (2, H)) \u2297 A(S\u03b84 )) which at\nfirst sight seems unsuitable to pair with an element in HC4 (A(S\u03b84 )). However, there is\na pairing between the K-theory group K0 (A(SL\u03b8 (2, H)) \u2297 A(S\u03b84 )) and the K homology\ngroup K0 (A(S\u03b84 )). Recall that for any algebra A from Kasparov's KK-theory one has\nthat K0 (A) = KK(A, C) and K0 (A) = KK(C, A). As described in [6, App. IV.A], for\nalgebras A, B and C, there is a map \u03c4C : KK(A, B) \u2192 KK(C \u2297 A, C \u2297 B) which simply tensors a Kasparov A \u2212 B module by C on the left. In our case we get an element\n\u03c4A(SL\u03b8 (2,H)) [S\u03b84 ] \u2208 KK (A(SL\u03b8 (2, H)) \u2297 A(S\u03b84 ), A(SL\u03b8 (2, H))) which can be paired with [P ]\nvia the cup product [12]. Thus we obtain the desired pairing:\n\u0001\n\u0001\nKK C, A(SL\u03b8 (2, H)) \u2297 A(S\u03b84) \u00d7 KK A(S\u03b84), C \u2192 KK (C, A(SL\u03b8 (2, H))) ,\n\u0001\n[P ], [S\u03b84] 7\u2192 h[P ], \u03c4A(SL\u03b8 (2,H)) [S\u03b84 ]i.\nHaving [P ] = [1 \u2297 p], we obtain\n\nh[P ], \u03c4A(SL\u03b8 (2,H)) [S\u03b84 ]i = [1] \u2297 h[p], [S\u03b84 ]i = [1] \u2208 K0 (A(SL\u03b8 (2, H))),\nwhere in the last line we used the equality h[p], [S\u03b84 ]i = 1 proved in [8] too. The above is\nthe statement that the value 1 of the topological charge is constant over the family.\n18\n\n\f5.2\n\nA family of connections\n\nWhen transforming u by the coaction of SL\u03b8 (2, H) in (4.1), one transforms the connection\n1-form \u03c9 in (5.1) as well to \u03c9\ne = (e\n\u03c9ab ) with,\nX\n\u0001\n\u03c9\neab := \u2206L (\u03c9ab ) = 12\n(A\u2217 )ik Akj \u2297 (u\u2217 )ai dujb \u2212 d(u\u2217 )ai ujb .\n(5.4)\nkij\n\nSince \u2206L is linear, \u03c9\ne is still traceless (\n\nP\n\na\n\n\u03c9\neaa = 0) and skew-Hermitean (e\n\u03c9ab = \u2212(e\n\u03c9 \u2217 )ba ).\n\nProposition 5.4. The instanton connection 1-form \u03c9 is invariant under the coaction of\nthe quantum group Sp\u03b8 (2), that is for this quantum group one has\n\u2206L (\u03c9ab ) = 1 \u2297 \u03c9ab .\nProof. This is a simple consequence of the fact that for Sp\u03b8 (2) one has\nfrom which (5.4) reduces to \u03c9\neab = 1 \u2297 \u03c9ab .\n\nP\n\n\u2217\nk (A )ik Akj\n\n= \u03b4ij\n\nHence, the relevant space that parametrizes the connection one-forms is not SL\u03b8 (2, H)\nbut rather the quotient of SL\u03b8 (2, H) by Sp\u03b8 (2). Denoting by \u03c0 the natural quotient map\nfrom A(SL\u03b8 (2, H)) to A(Sp\u03b8 (2)), the algebra of the quotient is the algebra of coinvariants\nof the natural left coaction \u2206L = (\u03c0 \u2297 id) \u25e6 \u2206 of Sp\u03b8 (2) on SL\u03b8 (2, H):\nA(M\u03b8 ) := {a \u2208 A(SL\u03b8 (2, H)) | \u2206L (a) = 1 \u2297 a}.\nSince Sp\u03b8 (2) is a quantum subgroup of SL\u03b8 (2, H) the quotient is well defined: the algebra\nA(M\u03b8 ) is a quantum homogeneous space and the inclusion A(M\u03b8 ) \u0592\u2192 A(SL\u03b8 (2, H)) is a\nnoncommutative principal bundle with A(Sp\u03b8 (2)) as structure group.\nLemma 5.5. The\nquotient\nspace A(M\u03b8 ) is generated as an algebra by the\nP quantum\nP\n\u2217\nelements mij := k (A )ik Akj = k (Aki )\u2217 Akj .\n\nProof. Since the relations in the quotient A(Sp\u03b8 (2)) are quadratic in the matrix elements\nAij and (Aij )\u2217 , the generators of A(M\u03b8 ) have to be at least quadratic in them. For the\nfirst leg ofPthe tensor product \u2206(a) to involve these relations in A(Sp\u03b8 (2)), we need to\ntake a = i (Aik )\u2217 Ail , so that\nX\n(\u03c0 \u2297 id)\u2206(a) =\n\u03c0((Aim )\u2217 Ain ) \u2297 (Amk )\u2217 Anl\nimn\nX\nX\n=\n\u03c0((Aim )\u2217 )\u03c0(Ain ) \u2297 (Amk )\u2217 Anl =\n\u03b4mn \u2297 (Amk )\u2217 Anl ,\nimn\n\nmn\n\ngiving the desired result.\nWe will think of the transformed \u03c9\ne in (5.4) as a family of connection one-forms\nparametrized by the noncommutative space M\u03b8 . At the classical value \u03b8 = 0, we get the\nmoduli space M\u03b8=0 = SL(2, H)/Sp(2) of instantons of charge 1. For each point x in\nM\u03b8=0 , the evaluation map evx : A(M\u03b8=0) \u2192 C gives an instanton connection (i.e. one\nwith self-dual curvature) (evx \u2297 id)e\n\u03c9 on the bundle over S 4 described by (evx \u2297 id)P .\n\n19\n\n\f5.3\n\nThe space M\u03b8 of connections and its geometry\n\nThe structure of the P\nalgebra A(M\u03b8 ) is deduced from that of A(SL\u03b8 (2, H)).

Elements (mij ) of the matrix M enter\nthe expression for \u03c12 . With pkl the components of the defining projector p in (2.4) and\nhaving formula (4.7), one finds that\nX\n\u03c12 = 21\n\u03b7ij mij \u2297 pji\nij\n\n= [(m + n) \u2297 1 + (m \u2212 n) \u2297 x + \u03bc g1\u2217 \u2297 \u03b1 + \u03bc g2 \u2297 \u03b2 + \u03bc g1 \u2297 \u03b1\u2217 + \u03bc g2\u2217 \u2297 \u03b2 \u2217 ] .\n1\n2\n\nIn particular, for Aij \u2208 A(Sp\u03b8 (2)) one gets \u03c12 = 12 (1 \u2297 tr(p)) = 1 \u2297 1, as already observed\nin Remark 4.1.\n20\n\n\f5.4\n\nThe boundary of M\u03b8\n\nThe defining matrix M of M\u03b8 in (5.5), with the commutation relations among its entries,\nis strikingly similar to the defining projection p of A(S\u03b84 ) in (2.5) with the corresponding\ncommutation relations. Clearly, the crucial difference is that while for A(S\u03b84) we have a\nspherical relation, for M\u03b8 we have the relation (5.8) which makes M\u03b8 a \u03b8-deformation\nof a hyperboloid in 6 dimensions. This becomes more clear if we introduce two central\nelements w and y, given in terms of m, n by\nw := 12 (m + n);\n\ny := 21 (m \u2212 n).\n\nRelation (5.8) then reads\nw 2 \u2212 (y 2 + g1\u2217 g1 + g2\u2217 g2 ) = 1,\n\n(5.9)\n\nmaking evident the hyperboloid structure. Let us examine its structure at 'infinity'. We\nfirst adjoin the inverse of w to A(M\u03b8 ), and stereographically project onto the coordinates,\nY := w \u22121 y,\n\nG1 := w \u22121 g1 ,\n\nG2 := w \u22121 g2 .\n\nThe relation (5.9) becomes,\nY 2 + G\u22171 G1 + G\u22172 G2 = 1 \u2212 w \u22122 .\nEvaluating w as a real number, and taking its 'limit to infinity' we get a spherical relation,\nY 2 + G\u22171 G1 + G\u22172 G2 = 1.\nBy combining this with relations (5.7), we can conclude that at the 'boundary' of M\u03b8 ,\nwe re-encounter the noncommutative 4-sphere A(S\u03b84) via the identification\nY \u2194x,\n\nG1 \u2194 \u03b1\n\nG2 \u2194 \u03b2.\n\nThe above construction is the analogue of the classical structure, in which 4-spheres are\nfound at the boundary of the moduli space.\n\n6\n\nOutlook\n\nWe have constructed a noncommutative family of instantons of charge 1 on the noncommutative 4-sphere S\u03b84 . The family is parametrized by a noncommutative space M\u03b8\nwhich reduces to the moduli space of charge 1 instantons on S 4 in the limit when \u03b8 \u2192 0.\nAlthough this means that M\u03b8 is a quantization of the moduli space M\u03b8=0 , it does not\nimply that it is itself a space of moduli. In order to call this the moduli space of charge 1\ninstantons on S\u03b84 a few things must be clarified. We mention in particular two important\npoints that for the moment lack a proper understanding.\nFirst of all, we are confronted with the difficulty of finding a proper notion of gauge\ngroup and gauge transformations. A naive dualization of the undeformed construction\nwould lead one to consider the group of A(SU(2))-coequivariant algebra maps from the\nalgebra A(SU(2)) to A(S\u03b87 ), equipped with the convolution product. However, since the\nalgebra A(SU(2)) is commutative as opposed to A(S\u03b87 ), one quickly realizes that there\n21\n\n\fare not so many elements in this group (an interesting open problem is to find in general\na correct noncommutative analogue of the group of maps from a space X to a group G).\nThe second open problem is related to the fact that one would need some sort of universality for the noncommutative family of instantons to call it a moduli space. A possible\nnotion of universality could be defined as follows. A family of instantons parametrized\nby A(M) is said to be universal if for any other noncommutative family of instantons\nparametrized by, say, an algebra B, there exists an algebra map \u03c6 : M \u2192 B such that\nthis family can be obtained from the universal family via the map \u03c6. Again, this is the\nanalogue of the notion of universality for noncommutative families of maps as in [23, 20].\nBut it appears that, in order to prove universality for the actual family that we have\nconstructed in the present paper, an argument along the classical lines \u2013 involving a local\nconstruction of the moduli space from its tangent bundle [3] \u2013 fails here, due to the fact\nthat there is no natural notion of a tangent space to a noncommutative space.\nProgress on both of these problems must await another time.\n\nAcknowledgments\nWe thank Simon Brain, Eli Hawkins, Mark Rieffel, Lech Woronowicz and Makoto Yamashita for useful discussions and remarks.
