One is the BogomolovMiyaoka-Yau inequality KS2 \u2264 9\u03c7(S) ([M1], [Y1], [Y2]), while the other is the classical Noether inequality KS2 \u2265 2pg \u2212 4 \u2265 2\u03c7(X) \u2212 6. The fundamental importance\nof these inequalities in mind, M. Reid asked in 1980s\nQuestion 1. What would be the right analogue of the Noether inequality in dimension three?\n3\nLet X be a minimal threefold. If KX is Cartier and very ample, then KX\n\u2265\n2pg \u22126 by Clifford's theorem applied to the intersection curve cut out by two general\nmembers of |KX |. In 1992, Kobayashi [Kob] studied Gorenstein canonical 3-folds\n3\nand obtained an effective, but partial, upper bound of KX\nin terms of pg (X) for such\nvarieties. One of his discoveries is that too naive a generalization of the classical\nNoether inequality is in general false; there are a series of smooth projective 3-folds\nX with ample canonical divisor such that\n3\nKX\n=\n\n2\n(2pg (X) \u2212 5), (pg (X) = 7, 10, 13, * * * ).\n3\n\n(0.1)\n\nIn what follows, we show that Kobayashi's examples indeed attain the minima of\n3\nKX\n, provided X is smooth and KX is ample:\nCorollary 2.

CHEN\n\nTheorem 3. Let X be a minimal projective 3-fold of general type (with only Qfactorial terminal singularities). Assume that n +1 = pg (X) \u2265 2 and let \u03c61 : X 99K\nPn be the canonical map. Then we have the following inequalities according to the\ndimension of \u03c61 (X) :\n3\n(1) KX\n\u2265 2pg (X) \u2212 6 if dim\u03c61 (X) = 3.\n3\n(2) KX \u2265 pg (X) \u2212 2 if dim\u03c61 (X) = 2 and pg (X) \u2265 6. If, in addition, a general\n3\nfibre of \u03c61 is a curve of genus\u2265 3, then KX\n\u2265 2pg (X) \u2212 4.\n(3) When \u03c61 is a curve, let S be the minimal model of a general irreducible\nmember of the movable part of |KX | and put a = KS2 , b = pg (S). Assume k =\n[ 21 (pg \u2212 2)] \u2265 4, where [x] stands for the round down of x. Then we have\n3\nKX\n\n\u2265\n\n(\n\n2\n\n4\n6k\n5\nmin{ 3k2 6k\n+8k+4 * (pg (X) \u2212 3 ), 3k+4 * (pg (X) \u2212 3 )},\n2\n\nk\n(k+1)2\n\n* a * (pg (X) \u2212 1),\n\nif (a, b) = (1, 1)\nif (a, b) 6= (1, 1)\n\nThe intersection numbers between Weil divisors on singular surfaces are not\nnecessarily integers, which causes difficulties to get optimal estimates in case (3).\nRemark 4. We make extra assumptions on pg (X) in Theorem 3(2), 3(3) simply for\ngetting better inequalities. Our method works also for the case pg (X) \u2265 2. Recall\nthat the geometric genus of a surface of general type with KS2 = 1 is bounded by\n2 from above. Furthermore, the surface in case (3) of the theorem has positive\n3\ngeometric genus. Hence Theorem 3 asserts that KX\n\u2265 2pg (X) \u2212 6 unless X is\ncanonically fibred by curves of genus two in case (2) or by surfaces with a = KS2 = 1,\nb = pg (S) = 2 in case (3).\nWhen X is Gorenstein, we have the following theorem, which improves the results\nknown so far:\nTheorem 5. Let X be a minimal projective Gorenstein 3-fold of general type with\nonly locally factorial terminal singularities.\n(1) Assume that X is neither canonically fibred by surfaces S with c1 (S)2 = 1,\n3\npg (S) = 2 nor by curves of genus two. Then KX\n\u2265 2pg (X) \u2212 6.\n(2) Assume that X is smooth and that X is not canonically fibred by surfaces S\n3\nwith c1 (S)2 = 1, pg (S) = 2. Then KX\n\u2265 23 (2pg (X) \u2212 5).\n2\n3\n(11pg (X)\u221216),\n(3) Assume that the canonical model of X is factorial. If KX\n< 21\nthen X is not smooth and is canonically fibred by curves of genus two.\nThese inequalities have a certain interesting application which will be presented\nin another note.\n1. Preliminaries\n1.1 Conventions. Let X be a normal projective variety of dimension d. We\ndenote by Div(X) the group of Weil divisors on X. An element D \u2208 Div(X) \u2297 Q is\ncalled a Q-divisor. A Q-divisor D is said to be Q-Cartier if mD is a Cartier divisor\nfor some positive integer m. For a Q-Cartier divisor D and an irreducible curve\nC \u2282 X, we can define the intersection number D * C in a natural way. A Q-Cartier\ndivisor D is called nef (or numerically effective) if D * C \u2265 0 for any effective curve\nC \u2282 X. A nef divisor D is called big if Dd > 0. We say that X is Q-factorial if\nevery Weil divisor on X is Q-Cartier. For a Weil divisor D on X, denote by OX (D)\n\n\fINEQUALITIES OF NOETHER TYPE\n\n3\n\nthe corresponding reflexive sheaf. Denote by KX a canonical divisor of X, which\nis a Weil divisor. X is called minimal if KX is a nef Q-Cartier divisor. X is said to\nbe of general type if \u03ba(X) = dim(X). We refer to [R1] for definitions of canonical\nand terminal singularities.\nThe symbols \u223c, \u2261 and =Q respectively stands for linear, numerical and Q-linear\nequivalences.\nP\n1.2 Vanishing theorem. Let D =\nai Di be a Q-divisor on X, where the Di\nare distinct prime divisors and ai \u2208 Q. We define\nX\nthe round-down xDy :=\nxai yDi , where xai y is the integral part of ai ;\nthe round-up pDq := \u2212x\u2212Dy;\n\nthe fractional part {D} := D \u2212 xDy.\nWe always use the Kawamata-Viehweg vanishing theorem in the following form.\nVanishing Theorem. ( [Ka1] or [V1]) Let X be a smooth complete variety, D \u2208\nDiv(X) \u2297 Q. Assume the following two conditions:\n(i) D is nef and big;\n(ii) the fractional part of D has supports with only normal crossings.\nThen H i (X, OX (KX + pDq)) = 0 for all i > 0.\nNote that, when S is a surface, the above theorem is true without the condition\n(ii) according to Sakai ([S]) or Miyaoka ([M3, Proposition 2.3]) (also cited in [E-L,\n(1.2)]).\n1.3 Set up for canonical maps. Let X be a projective minimal 3-fold with only\nQ-factorial terminal singularities. Suppose pg (X) \u2265 2. We study the canonical map\n\u03c61 which is usually a rational map. Take the birational modification \u03c0 : X \u2032 \u2212\u2192 X,\nfollowing Hironaka, such that\n(1) X \u2032 is smooth;\n(2) the movable part of |KX \u2032 | is base point free;\n(3) \u03c0 \u2217 (KX ) is linearly equivalent to a divisor supported by a divisor of normal\ncrossings.\nDenote by g the composition \u03c61 \u25e6\u03c0. So g : X \u2032 \u2212\u2192 W \u2032 \u2286 Ppg (X)\u22121 is a morphism.\nf\ns\nLet g : X \u2032 \u2212\u2192 W \u2212\u2192 W \u2032 be the Stein factorization of g. We can write\nKX \u2032 =Q \u03c0 \u2217 (KX ) + E =Q S1 + Z1 ,\nwhere S1 is the movable part of |KX \u2032 |, Z1 the fixed part and E is an effective\nQ-divisor which is a Q-linear combination of distinct exceptional divisors. We can\nalso write\n\u03c0 \u2217 (KX ) =Q S1 + E \u2032 ,\nwhere E \u2032 = Z1 \u2212 E is actually an effective Q-divisor and so p\u03c0 \u2217 (KX )q means\npS1 + E \u2032 q. We note that 1 \u2264 dim(W ) \u2264 3.\nIf dim\u03c61 (X) = 2, we see that a general fiber of f is a smooth projective curve\nof genus g \u2265 2. We say that X is canonically fibred by curves of genus g.\nIf dim\u03c61 (X) = 1, we see that a general fiber F of f is a smooth projective surface\nof general type. We say that X is canonically fibred by surfaces with invariants\n(c21 , pg ) := (KF2 0 , pg (F )), where F0 is the minimal model of F .\n\n\f4\n\nM. CHEN\n\n2. Several simple lemmas\nThe following result is a direct application of an inequality on curves proved by\nCastelnuovo ([Cas]) and Beauville ([Be1]).\nLemma 2.1. ( [Ch1, Proposition 2.1]) Let S be a smooth projective algebraic surface and L an effective, nef and prime divisor on S. Suppose (KS \u2212 L) * L \u2265 0 and\n|L| defines a birational rational map onto its image. Then\nL2 \u2265 3h0 (S, OS (L)) \u2212 7.\nLemma 2.2. Let S be a smooth projective surface of general type and L a nef\ndivisor on S. The following holds.\n(i) Suppose that |L| gives a non-birational, generically finite map onto its image.\nThen L2 \u2265 2h0 (S, OS (L)) \u2212 4.\n(ii) Suppose that there exists a linear subsystem \u039b \u2282 |L| such that \u039b defines a\ngenerically finite map of degree d onto its image. Then L2 \u2265 d[dimC \u039b \u2212 1] where\ndimC \u039b denotes the projective dimension of \u039b.\nProof. (i) is a special case of (ii).\nIn order to prove (ii), we take blow-ups \u03c0 : S \u2032 \u2212\u2192 S such that \u03a6\u03c0 \u2217 \u039b gives a\nmorphism. Let M be the movable part of \u03c0 \u2217 \u039b. Then h0 (S \u2032 , M ) = dimC \u039b + 1 and\nM 2 \u2265 d(h0 (S \u2032 , M ) \u2212 2).\nSince M \u2264 \u03c0 \u2217 (L), we get the inequality L2 \u2265 M 2 \u2265 d(dimC \u039b \u2212 1). \u0003\nLemma 2.3. Let C be a complete smooth algebraic curve. Suppose D is a divisor\non C such that h0 (C, OC (D)) \u2265 g(C) + 1. Then deg(D) \u2265 2g(C).\nProof. This is a direct result by virtue of R-R and Clifford's theorem.\n\n\u0003\n\nLemma 2.4. Let S be a smooth minimal projective surface of general type. The\nfollowing holds:\n(i) |mKS | is base point free for all m \u2265 4;\n(ii) |3KS | is base point free provided KS2 \u2265 2;\n(iii) |3KS | is base point free provided pg (S) > 0 and pg (S) 6= 2;\n(iv) |2KS | is base point free provided pg (S) > 0 or KS2 \u2265 5.\nProof. Both (i) and (ii) can be derived from results of Bombieri ([Bo]) and Reider\n([Rr]).\nIf pg (S) \u2265 3, then KS2 \u2265 2 by Noether inequality. The base point freeness of\n|3KS | follows from (ii). If KS2 = 1 and pg (S) = 1, |3KS | is base point free by [Cat1].\nIf KS2 = 1 and pg (S) = 2, |3KS | definitely has base points. So (iii) is true.\n(iv) follows from [Ci, Theorem 3.1] and Reider's theorem. \u0003\nLemma 2.5. Let S be a smooth projective surface of general type. Let \u03c3 : S \u2212\u2192\nS0 be the contraction onto the minimal model. Suppose that there is an effective\nirreducible curve C on S such that C \u2264 \u03c3 \u2217 (2KS0 ) and h0 (S, C) = 2. If KS20 =\npg (S) = 1, then C * \u03c3 \u2217 (KS0 ) \u2265 2.\nProof. We may assume that |C| is a free pencil. Otherwise, we blow-up S at base\npoints of |C|. Denote C1 := \u03c3(C). Then h0 (S0 , C1 ) \u2265 2. Suppose C * \u03c3 \u2217 (KS0 ) = 1.\n\n\fINEQUALITIES OF NOETHER TYPE\n\n5\n\nThen C1 *KS0 = 1. Because pa (C1 ) \u2265 2, we see that C12 > 0. From KS0 (KS0 \u2212C1 ) =\n0, we get (KS0 \u2212 C1 )2 \u2264 0, i.e. C12 \u2264 1. Thus C12 = 1 and KS0 \u2261 C1 . This\nmeans KS0 \u223c C1 by virtue of [Cat1], which is impossible because pg (S) = 1. So\nC * \u03c3 \u2217 (KS0 ) \u2265 2. \u0003\nLemma 2.6. ( [Ch4, Lemma 2.7]) Let X be a smooth projective variety of dimension \u2265 2. Let D be a divisor on X such that h0 (X, OX (D)) \u2265 2. Let S be a smooth\nprime divisor on X and assume that S is not contained in the fixed part of |D|.\nDenote by M the movable part of |D| and by N the movable part of |D|S | on S. If\nthe natural restriction map\n\u03b8\n\nH 0 (X, OX (D)) \u2212\u2192 H 0 (S, OS (D|S ))\nis surjective, then M |S \u2265 N and, in particular,\nh0 (S, OS (M |S )) = h0 (S, OS (N )) = h0 (S, OS (D|S )).\n3. Proof of Theorem 3\n3\naccording to the dimension of the canonical image\nWe give estimates of KX\n\u03c61 (X). Let the notation be as in (1.3) throughout this section. Thus S1 is a general\nmember of the movable part of |\u03c0 \u2217 (KX )| on a resolution of the indeterminacy of\n\u03c61 .\n\nThe first case is dim\u03c61 (X) = 3. Kobayashi ([Kob]) proved\nProposition 3.1. Let X be a projective minimal algebraic 3-fold of general type\nwith only Q-factorial terminal singularities. Suppose dim\u03c61 (X) = 3. Then\n3\nKX\n\u2265 2pg (X) \u2212 6.\n\nProof. We give a very simple proof of this result in order to keep this note selfcontained.\nIn this situation, a general member S1 \u2208 |S1 | is a smooth irreducible projective\n3\nsurface of general type. Because KX is nef and big, we have KX\n= \u03c0 \u2217 (KX )3 \u2265 S13 .\nDenote L := S1 |S1 . Then L is a nef and big divisor on S1 and |L| defines a\ngenerically finite map onto its image. It is obvious that\nh0 (S1 , L) \u2265 h0 (X \u2032 , S1 ) \u2212 1 = pg (X) \u2212 1.\nNote also that pg (X) \u2265 4 under the assumption of this proposition.\nIf |L| gives a birational map, then, by Lemma 2.1,\nL2 \u2265 3h0 (S1 , L) \u2212 7 \u2265 3pg (X) \u2212 10 \u2265 2pg (X) \u2212 6.\nIf |L| gives a non-birational rational map, then, by Lemma 2.2,\nL2 \u2265 2h0 (S1 , L) \u2212 4 \u2265 2pg (X) \u2212 6.\n3\nTherefore KX\n\u2265 S13 = L2 \u2265 2pg (X) \u2212 6. The proof is complete.\n\n\u0003\n\nThe second case is dim\u03c61 (X) = 2. The general member S1 is an irreducible\nsmooth surface of general type. The canonical map gives a fibration f : X \u2032 \u2212\u2192 W ,\nand we let C denote its general fiber, which is a smooth curve of genus \u2265 2.\n\n\f6\n\nM. CHEN\n\nProposition 3.2. Let X be a projective minimal algebraic 3-fold of general type\nwith only Q-factorial terminal singularities. Suppose dim\u03c61 (X) = 2 and pg (X) \u2265 6.\n3\nThen either g(C) \u2265 3 and KX\n\u2265 23 g(C)(pg (X) \u2212 2) or C is a curve of genus 2 and\n3\nKX\n\u2265 pg (X) \u2212 2.\nProof. We prove the proposition through several steps.\n3\nStep 1 (bounding KX\nin terms of (L1 , C)). Recall that we have \u03c0 \u2217 (KX ) =Q\n\u2032\n\u2032\nS1 + E , where E is an effective Q-divisor. Put L1 := \u03c0 \u2217 (KX )|S1 and L := S1 |S1 .\nThen L1 is a nef and big Q-divisor on the surface S1 and |L| is composed of a free\npencil of curves on S1 . It is obvious that L21 \u2265 L1 * L. We can write\n\nL = S1 |S1 \u223c\n\na\nX\n\nCi \u2261 aC,\n\ni=1\n\nwhere a \u2265 h0 (S1 , L) \u2212 1 \u2265 pg (X) \u2212 2 and the Ci\u2032 s are fibers of f contained in the\nsurface S1 . Thus we see that\n3\nKX\n= \u03c0 \u2217 (KX )3 \u2265 L21 \u2265 L1 * L \u2265 (L1 * C) * (pg (X) \u2212 2),\n3\nand we get a lower bound of KX\nby giving an estimate of (L1 * C) from below.\n\nStep 2 (the generic finiteness of the tricanonical map \u03c63 ). Look at the sublinear\nsystem\n|KX \u2032 + p\u03c0 \u2217 (KX )q + S1 | \u2282 |3KX \u2032 |.\nWe claim that \u03c63 is generically finite whenever pg (X) \u2265 4. We only have to prove\nthat \u03c63 |S1 is generically finite for a general member S1 . By the vanishing theorem,\nwe have\n|KX \u2032 + p\u03c0 \u2217 (KX )q + S1 |\n\nS1\n\n= KS1 + p\u03c0 \u2217 (KX )q|S1\n\u2283 KS1 + p\u03c0 \u2217 (KX )|S1 q .\n\nWe want to prove that \u03a6|KS1 +p\u03c0 \u2217 (KX )|S1 q| is generically finite. Because KS1 +\np\u03c0 \u2217 (KX )|S1 q \u2265 L, we see that |KS1 + p\u03c0 \u2217 (KX )|S1 q| separates different fibers of\n\u03a6|L| . So we only have to verify that \u03a6|KS1 +p\u03c0 \u2217 (KX )|S1 q| |C is finite for an arbitrary\nsmooth fiber C of f contained in S1 . We have\nL1 \u2261 L + EQ \u2261 aC + EQ ,\nwhere a \u2265 pg (X) \u2212 2 \u2265 2 and EQ := E \u2032 |S1 is an effective Q-divisor on S1 . Thus\n1\n1\nL1 \u2212 C \u2212 EQ \u2261 (1 \u2212 )L1\na\na\nis a nef and big Q-divisor. Using the vanishing theorem again, we get\n1\nH 1 (S1 , KS1 + pL1 \u2212 EQ q \u2212 C) = 0.\na\nThis means that |KS1 + pL1 \u2212 a1 EQ q| C = |KC + D|, where D := pL1 \u2212 a1 EQ q|C is\na divisor on C with positive degree. Because g(C) \u2265 2, the linear system |KC + D|\ngives a finite map, implying the generic finiteness of \u03c63 .\n\n\fINEQUALITIES OF NOETHER TYPE\n\n7\n\nStep 3 (Estimation of (L1 * C)). Since |3KX \u2032 | gives a generically finite map, so\ndoes M3 |S1 on the surface S1 , where M3 is the movable part of |3KX \u2032 |. Thus\n\u03a6|M3 |S1 | maps general C of genus \u2265 2 to a curve and hence M3 |S1 * C \u2265 2. Noting\nthat 3\u03c0 \u2217 (KX ) =Q M3 + E3 where E3 is an effective Q-divisor, we see that\n3\u03c0 \u2217 (KX )|S1 * C \u2265 M3 |S1 * C \u2265 2,\ni.e., L1 * C \u2265 32 . From this crude initial estimate, we derive a better one. To do\nthis, we run a recursive program (the \u03b1-program) below.\nPick up a positive integer \u03b1. We have\n|KX \u2032 + p\u03b1\u03c0 \u2217 (KX )q + S1 | \u2282 |(\u03b1 + 2)KX \u2032 |.\nThe vanishing theorem gives\n|KX \u2032 + p\u03b1\u03c0 \u2217 (KX )q + S1 |\n\nS1\n\n= KS1 + p\u03b1\u03c0 \u2217 (KX )q|S1\n\u2283 |KS1 + p\u03b1L1 q|.\n\nWe see that \u03b1L1 \u2212 C \u2212 a1 EQ \u2261 (\u03b1 \u2212 a1 )L1 is a nef and big Q-divisor. Using the\nvanishing theorem on S1 again, we get\n1\n|KS1 + p\u03b1L1 \u2212 EQ q|\na\n\nC\n\n= |KC + D\u03b1 |,\n\n(3.1)\n\nwhere D\u03b1 := p\u03b1L1 \u2212 a1 EQ q|C with deg(D\u03b1 ) \u2265 p(\u03b1 \u2212 a1 )L1 * Cq. We have to use\nseveral symbols in order to obtain our result. Let M\u03b1+2 be the movable part of\n\u2032\n|(\u03b1 + 2)KX \u2032 |. Let M\u03b1+2\nbe the movable part of\n|KX \u2032 + p\u03b1\u03c0 \u2217 (KX )q + S1 |.\n\u2032\nClearly we have M\u03b1+2\n\u2264 M\u03b1+2 . Let N\u03b1 be the movable part of |KS1 + p\u03b1L1 q|.\n\u2032\nThen it is easy to see M\u03b1+2\n|S1 \u2265 N\u03b1 by Lemma 2.6. So\n\u2032\n(\u03b1 + 2)L1 \u2265Q M\u03b1+2 |S1 \u2265 M\u03b1+2\n|S1 \u2265 N\u03b1 .\n\nLet N\u03b1\u2032 be the movable part of |KS1 + p\u03b1L1 \u2212 a1 EQ q|. Then obviously N\u03b1 \u2265 N\u03b1\u2032 .\nFrom (3.1) and Lemma 2.6, we have h0 (C, N\u03b1\u2032 |C ) = h0 (C, KC + D\u03b1 ). Thus we see\nthat\nh0 (C, N\u03b1 |C ) \u2265 h0 (C, N\u03b1\u2032 |C ) = h0 (C, KC + D\u03b1 ).\nNow take \u03b1 = 2 and run the \u03b1-program. We get 4L1 * C \u2265 N2 * C. Because a > 3\nunder the assumption, we see that deg(D2 ) \u2265 p(2 \u2212 a1 ) 23 q = 2. Thus h0 (C, N2 |C ) \u2265\ng(C) + 1. By Lemma 2.3, we have N2 * C \u2265 2g(C). If g(C) = 2, we get L1 * C \u2265 1\n3\nand thus the inequality KX\n\u2265 pg (X) \u2212 2. If g(C) \u2265 3, we get L1 * C \u2265 23 . This\nis a better bound than the initial one. However this is not enough to derive our\nstatement. We have to optimize our estimation.\nStep 4 (Optimization). As has been seen in the previous step, we have L1 *C \u2265 23\nwhen g \u2265 3. We take \u03b1 = 1 now and run the \u03b1-program. Since pg (X) \u2265 6, we have\na \u2265 4. Thus\n1 3\ndeg(D1 ) \u2265 p(1 \u2212 ) q = 2.\na 2\n\n\f8\n\nM. CHEN\n\nSo h0 (C, N1 |C ) \u2265 g(C) + 1. Therefore we get, by Lemma 2.3, that\n3L1 * C \u2265 N1 * C \u2265 2g(C) \u2265 6 whenever g(C) \u2265 3.\nThis means L1 * C \u2265 2, which is what we want. So we have the inequality\n3\nKX\n\u2265\n\n2\n* g(C) * (pg (X) \u2212 2)\n3\n\nwhenever g(C) \u2265 3. The proof is complete.\n\n(3.2)\n\n\u0003\n\nThe last case is dim\u03c61 (X) = 1. The canonical map gives a fibration f : X \u2032 \u2212\u2192\nW where W is a smooth projective curve. Denote b := g(W ). We see that a general\nfiber F of f is a smooth projective surface of general type. Let \u03c3 : F \u2212\u2192 F0 be the\ncontraction onto the minimal model. Note that we always have pg (F ) > 0 in this\nPb1\nsituation. We also have S1 \u223c i=1\nFi \u2261 b1 F, where the Fi\u2032 s are fibers of f and\nb1 \u2265 pg (X) \u2212 1.\nProposition 3.3. Let X be a projective minimal algebraic 3-fold of general type\nwith only Q-factorial terminal singularities. Suppose dim\u03c61 (X) = 1. Let k \u2265 4 be\nk2\n3\n2\nan integer and assume that pg (X) \u2265 2k + 2. Then KX\n\u2265 (k+1)\n2 * KF0 * (pg (X) \u2212 1).\nProof. The proof proceeds through two steps.\n3\nStep 1 (bounding KX\nin terms of L2 ). On the surface F , we denote L :=\n\u03c0 (KX )|F . Then L is an effective nef and big Q-divisor. Because \u03c0 \u2217 (KX ) \u2261\nb1 F + E \u2032 with E \u2032 effective, we get\n\u2217\n\n3\nKX\n= \u03c0 \u2217 (KX )3 \u2265 (\u03c0 \u2217 (KX )2 * F ) * (pg (X) \u2212 1) = L2 * (pg (X) \u2212 1).\n\nSo the main point is to estimate L2 from below in order to prove the proposition.\nStep 2 (bounding L2 from below by studying the (k + 1)-canonical map \u03c6k+1 ).\nLet Mk+1 be the movable part of |(k + 1)KX \u2032 |. Then we may write\n(k + 1)\u03c0 \u2217 (KX ) =Q Mk+1 + Ek+1\nwhere Ek+1 is an effective Q-divisor. Therefore we see that (k + 1)L \u2265num Mk+1 |F .\nLet Nk be the movable part of |kKF |. According to Lemma 2.4, |kKF0 | is base point\nfree. Thus Nk = \u03c3 \u2217 (kKF0 ). We claim that Mk+1 |F \u2265 Nk . Then (k + 1)L \u2265 Nk\nand we get\nk2\n1\n2\nN\n=\nK2 .\nL2 \u2265\n(k + 1)2 k\n(k + 1)2 F0\nSo we have the inequality\n3\nKX\n\nk2\n* KF2 0 * (pg (X) \u2212 1).\n\u2265\n2\n(k + 1)\n\n(3.3)\n\nNow we prove the claim. In fact, \u03c61 is a morphism if b > 0. In this case, we\ndo not need any modification and f : X \u2032 = X \u2212\u2192 W is a fibration. A general\nfiber F is a smooth projective surface of general type, because the singularities on\nX are isolated. Furthermore F is minimal because KX is nef. By Kawamata's\n\n\fINEQUALITIES OF NOETHER TYPE\n\n9\n\nvanishing theorem for Q-Cartier Weil divisor ([KMM]), we have H 1 (X, kKX ) = 0.\nThis means |kKX + F | F = |kKF |. Noting that F \u2264 KX and using Lemma 2.6, we\nsee that the claim is true in this case.\nWe then consider the case with b = 0. We use the approach in [Kol, Corollary\n4.8] to prove it. The canonical map gives a fibration f : X \u2032 \u2212\u2192 P1 . Because\npg (X) \u2265 2k + 2, we see that O(2k + 1) \u0592\u2192 f\u2217 \u03c9X \u2032 . Thus we have\nk+1\nk\nk\nE := O(1) \u2297 f\u2217 \u03c9X\n\u2032 /P1 = O(2k + 1) \u2297 f\u2217 \u03c9X \u2032 \u0592\u2192 f\u2217 \u03c9X \u2032 .\nk+1 \u223c\nk+1\n0\n\u2032\nNote that H 0 (P1 , f\u2217 \u03c9X\n\u2032 ) = H (X , \u03c9X \u2032 ). It is well known that E is generated by\nk\nglobal sections and that f\u2217 \u03c9X\n\u2032 /P1 is a sum of line bundles with non-negative degree\n(cf. [F], [V2, V3]). Thus the global sections of E separates different fibers of f .\nk\nOn the other hand, the local sections of f\u2217 \u03c9X\n\u2032 give the k-canonical map of F and\nthese local sections can be extended to global sections of E. This essentially means\nMk+1 |F \u2265 Nk . \u0003\n\nProposition 3.4. Let X be a projective minimal algebraic 3-fold of general type\nwith only Q-factorial terminal singularities. Suppose that dim\u03c61 (X) = 1. Let k \u2265 3\nbe an integer and assume pg (X) \u2265 2k + 2. If (KF2 0 , pg (F )) = (1, 1), then\n3\nKX\n\u2265 min{\n\n6k 2\n4\n6k\n5\n* (pg (X) \u2212 ),\n* (pg (X) \u2212 )}.\n2\n3k + 8k + 4\n3 3k + 4\n3\n\nProof. From Step 2 in the proof of Proposition 3.3, we have shown that\n(k + 1)\u03c0 \u2217 (KX )|F \u2265 Mk+1 |F \u2265 k\u03c3 \u2217 (KF0 ).\n(Although we suppose k \u2265 4 in Proposition 3.3, the case with k = 3 can be parallelly\ntreated since |3KF0 | is base point free for a surface with (KF2 0 , pg (F )) = (1, 1).)\nThe canonical map derives a fibration f : X \u2032 \u2212\u2192 W . Because q(F ) = 0, we have\nq(X) = h1 (OX \u2032 ) = b + h1 (W, R1 f\u2217 \u03c9X \u2032 ) = b,\nh2 (OX ) = h1 (W, f\u2217 \u03c9X \u2032 ) + h0 (W, R1 f\u2217 \u03c9X \u2032 )\n= h1 (W, f\u2217 \u03c9X \u2032 ) \u2264 1.\nIt is obvious that h2 (OX ) = 0 when b = 0, since f\u2217 \u03c9X \u2032 is a line bundle of positive\ndegree. Anyway, we have q(X) \u2212 h2 (OX ) \u2265 0. Thus we get\n\u03c7(\u03c9X ) = pg (X) + q(X) \u2212 h2 (OX ) \u2212 1 \u2265 pg (X) \u2212 1.\nBy the plurigenus formula of Reid ([R1]), we have\nP2 (X) \u2265\n\n1 3\n1 3\nKX \u2212 3\u03c7(OX ) \u2265 KX\n+ 3[pg (X) \u2212 1].\n2\n2\n\n(3.4)\n\nLet M2 be the movable part of |2KX \u2032 |. We consider the natural restriction map \u03b3:\n\u03b3\n\nH 0 (X \u2032 , M2 ) \u2212\u2192 V2 \u2282 H 0 (F, M2 |F ) \u2282 H 0 (F, 2KF ),\n\n\f10\n\nM. CHEN\n\nwhere V2 is the image of \u03b3 as a C-subspace of H 0 (F, M2 |F ). Because h0 (2KF ) = 3,\nwe see that 1 \u2264 dimC V2 \u2264 3. Denote by \u039b2 the linear system corresponding toV2 .\nWe have dim\u039b2 = dimC V2 \u2212 1.\nCase 1. dimC V2 = 3.\nSince \u039b2 is a sub-system of |2KF |, we see that the restriction of \u03c62,X \u2032 to F is\nexactly the bicanonical map of F . Because \u03c62,F is a generically finite morphism\nof degree 4, \u03c62,X \u2032 is also a generically finite map of degree 4. Let S2 \u2208 |M2 | be a\ngeneral member. We can further modify \u03c0 such that |M2 | is base point free. Then\nS2 is a smooth projective irreducible surface of general type. On the surface S2 ,\ndenote L2 := S2 |S2 . L2 is a nef and big divisor. We have\n2\u03c0 \u2217 (KX )|S2 \u2265 S2 |S2 = L2 .\nWe consider the natural map\n\u03b3\u2032\n\nH 0 (X \u2032 , S2 ) \u2212\u2192 V2 \u2282 H 0 (S2 , L2 ),\nwhere V2 is the image of \u03b3 \u2032 . Denote by \u039b2 the linear system corresponding to V2 .\nBecause \u03c62 is generically finite map of degree 4, we see that |L2 | has a sub-system\n\u039b2 which gives a generically finite map of degree 4. By Lemma 2.2(ii), we get\nL22 \u2265 4(dimC \u039b2 \u2212 1) \u2265 4(P2 (X) \u2212 3). Therefore we have\n3\nKX\n\u2265\n\n1 2 1\n1 1 3\nL2 \u2265 (P2 (X) \u2212 3) \u2265 ( KX\n+ 3pg (X) \u2212 6).\n8\n2\n2 2\n\nTherefore\n3\nKX\n\u2265 2pg (X) \u2212 4.\n\n(3.5)\n\nCase 2. dimC V2 = 2.\nIn this case, dim\u03c62 (F ) = 1 and dim\u03c62 (X) = 2. We may further modify \u03c0 such\nthat |M2 | is base point free. Taking the Stein factorization of \u03c62 , we get a derived\nfibration f2 : X \u2032 \u2212\u2192 W2 where W2 is a surface. Let C be a general fiber of f2 . we\nsee that F is naturally fibred by curves with the same numerical type as C. On\nthe surface F , we have a free pencil \u039b2 \u2282 |2KF |. Let |C0 | be the movable part of\n\u039b2 . Then h0 (F, C0 ) = 2. Because q(F ) = 0, we see that |C0 | is a pencil over the\nrational curve. So a general member of |C0 | is an irreducible curve.

Inequalities for minimal Gorenstein 3-folds\n3\nThis section is devoted to study lower bounds for KX\nof Gorenstein 3-folds. Let\nX be a projective minimal Gorenstein 3-fold of general type with only locally fac3\ntorial terminal singularities. It is well known that KX\nis a positive even integer and\n3\n\u03c7(OX ) < 0. We also have the Miyaoka-Yau inequality ([M2]): KX\n\u2264 \u221272\u03c7(OX ).\nBesides, after taking a special birational modification to X according to Reid ([R2])\nwhile using a result of Miyaoka ([M2]), we get the plurigenus formula as follows.\n\nPm (X) = (2m \u2212 1)(\n\nm(m \u2212 1) 3\nKX \u2212 \u03c7(OX )).\n12\n\n(4.1)\n\nThe following theorem improves [Kob, Main Theorem], where we use the same\nnotations as in previous sections.\n\n\f12\n\nM. CHEN\n\nTheorem 4.1. Let X be a projective minimal Gorenstein 3-fold of general type\nwith only locally factorial terminal singularities. Then we have\n3\n(i) If dim\u03c61 (X) = 3, then KX\n\u2265 2pg (X) \u2212 6.\n(ii) If dim\u03c61 (X) = 2, i.e., X is canonically fibered by curves of genus g, then\n2\n3\nKX\n\u2265 p (g \u2212 1)q(pg (X) \u2212 2).\n3\n3\n(iii) If dim\u03c61 (X) = 1, then either KX\n\u2265 2pg (X) \u2212 4 or (KF2 0 , pg (F )) = (1, 2).\n\nProof. By Proposition 3.1, it is sufficient to study the cases dim\u03c61 (X) < 3.\nCase 1. dim\u03c61 (X) = 2.\nThe canonical map gives a fibration f : X \u2032 \u2212\u2192 W , where a general fiber C is\n3\na smooth curve of genus g. If g = 2, our inequality is KX\n\u2265 pg (X) \u2212 2, which\n\u2217\nis trivially true. Now we assume g \u2265 3. Denote L := \u03c0 (KX )|S1 , which is a nef\nand big Cartier divisor. Let S1 \u2208 |M1 | be a general member. Then S1 is a smooth\nprojective surface of general type. Noting that |S1 |S1 | is composed of a free pencil\nof curves with the same numerical type as C, we have\n\u03c0 \u2217 (KX )|S1 \u2261 aC + E2 ,\nwhere E2 is effective and a \u2265 pg (X) \u2212 2, and we immediately see\n3\nKX\n\u2265 (L * C)(pg (X) \u2212 2).\n\nThus it is sufficient to bound (L * C) from below.\nWe run once more a recursive program (the \u03b2-program) which is essentially\nsimilar to the \u03b1-program. There is, however, a minor difference between them.\nPick up a positive integer \u03b2. Obviously, we have\n|KX \u2032 + \u03b2\u03c0 \u2217 (KX ) + S1 | \u2282 |(\u03b2 + 2)KX \u2032 |.\nThe vanishing theorem gives\n|KX \u2032 + \u03b2\u03c0 \u2217 (KX ) + S1 |\n\nS1\n\n= |KS1 + \u03b2L|.\n\nWe have L \u2265 C. If \u03b2 > 1, then we have\n|KS1 + (\u03b2 \u2212 1)L + C|\n\nC\n\n= |KC + D\u03b2 |,\n\n\u2032\nwhere D\u03b2 := (\u03b2 \u2212 1)L|C . Let M\u03b2+2 be the movable part of |(\u03b2 + 2)KX \u2032 | and M\u03b2+2\n\u2032\nbe the movable part of |KX \u2032 + \u03b2\u03c0 \u2217 (KX ) + S1 |. Then M\u03b2+2 \u2265 M\u03b2+2\n. Let N\u03b2 be\nthe movable part of |KS1 + (\u03b2 \u2212 1)L + C|. Then, by Lemma 2.6, we have\n\u2032\n(\u03b2 + 2)L \u2265 M\u03b2+2 |S1 \u2265 M\u03b2+2\n|S1 \u2265 N\u03b2 .\n\nAlso by Lemma 2.6, we have h0 (C, N\u03b2 |C ) = h0 (KC + D\u03b2 ). If deg(D\u03b2 ) = (\u03b2 \u2212 1)(L *\nC) \u2265 2, then\nh0 (C, N\u03b2 |C ) = g \u2212 1 + (\u03b2 \u2212 1)(L * C).\n\n\fINEQUALITIES OF NOETHER TYPE\n\n13\n\nUsing R-R again and Clifford's theorem, we see that h1 (C, N\u03b2 |C ) = 0 and\n(\u03b2 + 2)(L * C) \u2265 N\u03b2 * C = 2g \u2212 2 + (\u03b2 \u2212 1)(L * C).\nWe get the inequality\nL*C \u2265\n\n2g \u2212 2 + (\u03b2 \u2212 1)(L * C)\n.\n\u03b2+2\n\n(4.2)\n\nNow take \u03b2 = 3. Then deg(D3 ) \u2265 2. According to (4.2), we see L * C > 1, i.e.\nL * C \u2265 2. From now on, we can constantly take \u03b2 = 2. we see that deg(D2 ) \u2265 2.\nSo (4.2) becomes L * C \u2265 2g\u22122\n. This means L * C \u2265 p 32 (g \u2212 1)q.\n3\nCase 2. dim\u03c61 (X) = 1.\nIn this case, the canonical map derives a fibration f : X \u2032 \u2212\u2192 W onto a smooth\ncurve W where a general fiber F of f is a smooth irreducible surface of general type.\nWe have \u03c0 \u2217 (KX ) = S1 +E \u2032 and S1 \u2261 b1 F , where b1 \u2265 pg (X)\u22121. Denote S = \u03c0(S1 )\n2\n2\nand F = \u03c0(F ). Then S \u2261 b1 F . Because F is pseudo-effective, KX * F \u2265 0. Note\n2\nthat KX * F is an even integer.\n2\n2\n3\nIf KX *F > 0, then we have KX\n*F \u2265 2(pg (X)\u22121) and thus KX\n\u2265 2(pg (X)\u22121)2 .\n2\nIf KX * F = 0, then OF (\u03c0 \u2217 (KX )|F ) \u223c\n= OF (\u03c3 \u2217 (KF0 )) by a trivial generalization\nof [Ch3, Lemma 2.3]. Thus we always have\n3\nKX\n= \u03c0 \u2217 (KX )3 \u2265 (\u03c0 \u2217 (KX )2 * F )(pg (X) \u2212 1)\n\n= \u03c3 \u2217 (KF0 )2 (pg (X) \u2212 1) \u2265 2(pg (X) \u2212 1)\nwhenever KF2 0 \u2265 2.\n3\nWhen KF2 0 = 1, the only possibility is 1 \u2264 pg (F ) \u2264 2. We can prove that KX\n\u2265\n2\n2pg (X) \u2212 4 if (KF0 , pg (F )) = (1, 1). In fact, this is the special case of Proposition\n3.4 and the estimation here is more exact since X is Gorenstein. The main point is\nthat we have \u03c0 \u2217 (KX )|F \u223c \u03c3 \u2217 (KF0 ). We see from the proof of Proposition 3.4 that\n3\n3\n(3.5) is still as KX\n\u2265 2pg (X) \u2212 4, that (3.6) corresponds to KX\n\u2265 2pg (X) \u2212 3 31 and\n3\nthat (3.7) will be replaced by KX\n\u2265 2pg (X) \u2212 2 23 . \u0003\nFrom Theorem 4.1, one sees that bad cases possibly occur when X is canonically\nfibered by curves of genus 2 or by surfaces with invariants (c21 , pg ) = (1, 2). For\ntechnical reasons, we are only able to treat a nonsingular 3-fold. One needs a new\nmethod to cover singular 3-folds.\nNow suppose that X is a smooth projective 3-fold. Let M be a divisor on X such\nthat h0 (X, M) \u2265 2 and that |M | has base points but no fixed part. By Hironaka's\ntheorem ([Hi]), we may take successive blow-ups\n\u03c0\n\n\u03c0\n\n\u03c0\n\nn\n\u03c0 : X \u2032 = Xn \u2192\nXn\u22121 \u2192 * * * \u2192 Xi \u2192i Xi\u22121 \u2192 * * * \u2192 X1 \u21921 X0 = X\n\nsuch that\n(i) \u03c0i is a single blow-up along smooth center Wi on Xi\u22121 for all i;\n(ii) Wi is contained in the base locus of the movable part of\n|(\u03c01 \u25e6 \u03c02 \u25e6 * * * \u25e6 \u03c0i\u22121 )\u2217 (M )|\n\n\f14\n\nM. CHEN\n\nand thus Wi is a reduced closed point or a smooth projective curve on Xi\u22121 ;\n(iii) the movable part of |\u03c0 \u2217 (M )| has no base points.\nIt is clear that the resulting 3-fold X \u2032 is still smooth. Let Ei be the exceptional\ndivisor on X \u2032 corresponding to Wi . Then we may write\nn\nn\nX\nX\n\u2217\n\u2217\nKX \u2032 = \u03c0 (KX ) +\nai Ei , \u03c0 (M ) = M +\nei Ei ,\ni=1\n\ni=1\n\n\u2217\n\nwhere ai , ei \u2208 Z, ai \u2265 0 and M is the movable part of |\u03c0 (M )|. From the definition\nof \u03c0, we see ei > 0 for all i.\nLemma 4.2. ai \u2264 2ei for all i.\n\nProof. We prove the simple lemma by induction. Denote by Mi the strict transform\n(i)\nof M in Xi for all i. Let Ei be the exceptional divisor on Xi corresponding to\n(i)\n(j)\nWi .

On the surface\nS1 , set L := \u03c0 \u2217 (KX )|S1 . We also have S1 |S1 \u2261 aC where a \u2265 pg (X) \u2212 2 and C is a\ngeneral fiber of the restricted fibration f |S1 : S1 \u2212\u2192 f (S1 ).

Denote E|S1 := EV + EH , where EV is\nthe vertical part and EH is the horizontal part. From KS1 * C = 2, one sees that\nEH * C = E|S1 * C = 1. This also means that EH is an irreducible curve and EH\ncomes from some exceptional divisor Ei with ai = 1. We may suppose that EH\ncomes from E0 . Then a0 = 1.

The proof is complete.\n\n\u0003\n\nRemark 4.4. As was pointed out by M. Reid ([R3, Remark (0.4)(v)]), the blow-up\nof a canonical singularity need not be normal and thus it need not be canonical,\neven if the original canonical point is a hypersurface singularity of multiplicity 2.\nBecause of this reason, we would rather treat a smooth 3-fold in Theorem 4.3,\nalthough the method might be all right for Gorenstein 3-folds.\nLemma 4.5. Let X be a smooth projective 3-fold of general type. Suppose pg (X) \u2265\n3, dim\u03c61 (X) = 1. Keep the same notations as in subsection 1.3. If (KF2 0 , pg (F )) =\n(1, 2), then one of the following holds:\n(i) b = 1, q(X) = 1 and h2 (OX ) = 0;\n(ii) b = 0, q(X) = 0 and h2 (OX ) \u2264 1.\nProof. Replacing X by a birational model, if necessary, we may suppose that \u03c61 is\na morphism. Note that we do not need here the minimality of X. Taking the Steinfactorization of \u03c61 , we get a derived fibration f : X \u2212\u2192 W . Let F be a general\nfiber of f . By assumption, (KF2 0 , pg (F )) = (1, 2) where F0 is the minimal model of\nF . According to [Ch2, Theorem 1], we see that b = g(W ) \u2264 1 whenever pg (X) \u2265 3.\nBecause q(F ) = 0, we can easily see that q(X) = b and h2 (OX ) = h1 (W, f\u2217 \u03c9X ). In\norder to prove the lemma, It is sufficient to study h1 (W, f\u2217 \u03c9X ). Since we are in a\nvery special situation, we should be able to obtain much more explicit information.\nLet L0 be the saturated sub-bundle of f\u2217 \u03c9X which is generated by H 0 (W, f\u2217 \u03c9X ).\nBecause |KX | is composed of a pencil of surfaces and \u03c61 factors through f , we see\nthat L0 is a line bundle on W . Denote L1 := f\u2217 \u03c9X /L0 . Then we have the exact\nsequence:\n0 \u2212\u2192 L0 \u2212\u2192 f\u2217 \u03c9X \u2212\u2192 L1 \u2212\u2192 0.\nNoting that rk(f\u2217 \u03c9X ) = 2, we see that L1 is also a line bundle. Noting that\nH 0 (W, L0 ) \u223c\n= H 0 (W, f\u2217 \u03c9X ), we have h1 (W, L0 ) \u2265 h0 (W, L1 ). When b = 1,\ndeg(L0 ) = pg (X) \u2265 3. When b = 0, deg(L0 ) = pg (X) \u2212 1 \u2265 2. Anyway, we\nhave h1 (W, L0 ) = 0. So h0 (W, L1 ) = 0. On the other hand, It is well-known that\n\u22121\nf\u2217 \u03c9X/W is semi-positive. Thus deg(L1 \u2297 \u03c9W\n) \u2265 0. This means deg(L1 ) \u2265 2(b \u2212 1).\n1\nUsing the R-R, we may easily deduce that h (L1 ) \u2264 1 \u2212 b. So\nh1 (W, f\u2217 \u03c9X )) \u2264 h1 (W, L0 ) + h1 (W, L1 ) \u2264 1 \u2212 b.\nSo h2 (OX ) \u2264 1 \u2212 b. The proof is complete. \u0003\n\n\f18\n\nM. CHEN\n\nLemma 4.6. Let X be a smooth projective 3-fold of general type. Suppose pg (X) \u2265\n3, dim\u03c61 (X) = 1 and (KF2 0 , pg (F )) = (1, 2). Let f : X \u2212\u2192 W be a derived fibration\nof \u03c61 . Suppose F1 and F2 are two fixed smooth fibres of f such that \u03c61 (F1 ) 6= \u03c61 (F2 ).\nThen dim\u03a6|KX +F1 +F2 | (X) = 2 and \u03a6|KX +F1 +F2 | |F = \u03a6|KF | for a general fiber F .\nProof. (i). If b = 1, we have h2 (OX ) = 0 by Lemma 4.5. From the exact sequence\nH 0 (X, KX + F1 + F2 ) \u2212\u2192 H 0 (F1 , KF1 ) \u2295 H 0 (F2 , KF2 ) \u2212\u2192 0,\none may easily see that dim\u03a6|KX +F1 +F2 | (X) = 2. Thus, for a general fiber F ,\ndim\u03a6|KX +F1 +F2 | (F ) = 1. Since pg (F ) = 2, one sees that \u03a6|KX +F1 +F2 | |F = \u03a6|KF | .\n(ii). If b = 0, we only have to study |KX + 2F1 ||F for a general fiber F . From\nthe short exact sequence:\n0 \u2212\u2192 OX (KX + F1 \u2212 F ) \u2212\u2192 OX (KX + F1 ) \u2212\u2192 OF (KF ) \u2212\u2192 0,\nwe have the long exact sequence\n\u03b21\n\n\u03b1\n\n1\n* * * \u2212\u2192 H 0 (X, KX + F1 ) \u2212\u2192\nH 0 (F, KF ) \u2212\u2192 H 1 (X, KX )\n\n\u2212\u2192 H 1 (X, KX + F1 ) \u2212\u2192 H 1 (F, KF ) = 0,\nIf \u03b11 is surjective for general F , then we see that\ndim\u03a6|KX +F1 | (F ) = dim\u03a6|KF | (F ) = 1 and dim\u03a6|KX +F1 | (X) = 2.\nSo dim\u03a6|KX +2F1 | (X) = 2. We are done. Otherwise, \u03b11 is not surjective. Because\n\u03b11 6= 0, we see that h2 (OX ) = h1 (X, KX ) \u2265 1. Because h2 (OX ) \u2264 1, h2 (OX ) =\n1 and \u03b21 is surjective. Therefore H 1 (X, KX + F1 ) = 0. This also means that\nH 1 (X, KX +F \u2032 ) = 0 for any smooth fiber F \u2032 since F \u2032 \u223c F1 . So we have H 1 (X, KX +\n2F1 \u2212 F ) = 0, which means |KX + 2F1 ||F = |KF |. So dim\u03a6|KX +2F1 | (X) = 2. The\nproof is complete. \u0003\nTheorem 4.7. Let X be a smooth projective 3-fold with ample canonical divisor.\nSuppose dim\u03c61 (X) = 1 and X is canonically fibered by surfaces with invariants\n3\n(c21 , pg ) = (1, 2). Then KX\n\u2265 32 (2pg (X) \u2212 7).\nProof. The proof is slightly longer, however with the same flavour as that of Theorem 4.3.\n2\nDenote by F a generic irreducible element of |KX |. We see that F is a 1-cycle\n2\non X. If the movable part of |KX | has base points, then F is a non-trivial effective\n2\n3\n\u2265 2pg (X) \u2212 2. Therefore we only have to treat\n1-cycle. So KX * F \u2265 2. Thus KX\nthe case when \u03c61 is a morphism.\nWe suppose pg (X) \u2265 3. We still assume that f : X \u2212\u2192 W is a derived fibration\nof \u03c61 . Note that b = g(W ) \u2264 1. Let M be the movable part of |KX + F1 + F2 |. Also\nnote that F is minimal in this situation and (KF2 , pg (F )) = (1, 2). It is well-known\nthat |KF | has exactly one base point, but no fixed part, and that a general member\nof |KF | is a smooth irreducible curve of genus 2. Since |KX +F1 +F2 ||F = |KF | and\naccording to Lemma 2.6, we see that M |F = KF . This means that |M | definitely\nhas base points. According to Hironaka, we can take successive blow-ups\n\u03c0\n\n\u03c0\n\n\u03c0\n\nn\n\u03c0 : X \u2032 = Xn \u2192\nXn\u22121 \u2192 * * * \u2192 Xi \u2192i Xi\u22121 \u2192 * * * \u2192 X1 \u21921 X0 = X\n\n\fINEQUALITIES OF NOETHER TYPE\n\n19\n\nsuch that\n(i) \u03c0i is a single blow-up along smooth center Wi on Xi\u22121 for all i;\n(ii) Wi is contained in the base locus of the movable part of\n|(\u03c01 \u25e6 \u03c02 \u25e6 * * * \u25e6 \u03c0i\u22121 )\u2217 (M )|\nand thus Wi is a reduced closed point or a smooth projective curve on Xi\u22121 ;\n(iii) the movable part of |\u03c0 \u2217 (M )| has no base points.\nDenote by Ei the exceptional divisor on X \u2032 corresponding to Wi for all i. Note\nthat the resulting 3-fold X \u2032 is still smooth. Let M be the movable part of |\u03c0 \u2217 (M )|\nand S \u2208 |M | be a general member. Then S is a smooth irreducible projective\nsurface of general type. Denote f \u2032 := f \u25e6 \u03c0. Then f \u2032 : X \u2032 \u2212\u2192 W is still a fibration.\nLet F \u2032 be a general fiber of f \u2032 . Note that F \u2032 has the minimal model F . We may\nwrite\np\nX\n\u2217\nKX \u2032 \u223c \u03c0 (KX ) +\nai Ei = \u03c0 \u2217 (KX ) + E\ni=0\n\nPp\n\n\u2217\n\nand \u03c0 (M ) = M + i=0 ei Ei . According to Lemma 4.2, we have 0 < ai \u2264 2ei for\nPb1\nall i. Recall that we have KX \u223c S1 + Z = i=1\nFi + Z, where b1 \u2265 pg (X) \u2212 1, the\nFi\u2032 s are fibers of f , S1 is the movable part of |KX | and Z the fixed part of |KX |.\nNote that there is an effective divisor Z0 \u2264 Z such that M \u223c S1 + F1 + F2 + Z0 .\nWe write\n\u2217\n\n\u2217\n\n\u03c0 (KX + F1 + F2 ) \u223c \u03c0 (M + Z \u2212 Z0 ) = M +\n\np\nX\n\nei Ei + \u03c0 \u2217 (Z \u2212 Z0 )\n\ni=0\n\n=M+\n\np\nX\ni=0\n\ne\u2032i Ei +\n\nq\nX\n\ndj Lj =: M + E \u2032 ,\n\nj=1\n\nwhere Ei 6= Lj , dj > 0, e\u2032i \u2265 ei for all i and Lj1 6= Lj2 whenever j1 6= j2 . Note\nthat \u03c0 \u2217 (M ) \u2265 \u03c0 \u2217 (S1 + F1 + F2 ) and that the strict transform of S1 is a union of b1\nfibers of f \u2032 , we see that\nM |S \u2265\n\nbX\n1 +m\n\nFj\u2032 |S \u2261 (b1 + m)F \u2032 |S\n\nj=1\n\nwhere the Fj\u2032 s are fibers of f \u2032 and m = 2. Because dim\u03a6|M | (X \u2032 ) = 2, we see\ndim\u03a6|M | (S) = 1 for a general member S. So, on S, the system |M |S | should\nbe composed of a free pencil of curves since (M |S )2 = M 3 = 0. On the other\nhand, we obviously have H 0 (X \u2032 , KX \u2032 \u2212 S) = 0. This instantly gives the inclusion\nH 0 (X \u2032 , KX \u2032 ) \u0592\u2192 H 0 (S, KX \u2032 |S ). So dim\u03a6|KX \u2032 | (S) \u2265 1. Because dim\u03c61 (X) = 1, we\nsee that dim\u03a6|KX \u2032 | (S) = 1. Thus It is clear f \u2032 (S) = W . So we have a surjective\nmorphism f \u2032 |S : S \u2212\u2192 W . The fiber of f \u2032 |S is exactly F \u2032 \u2229 S or the divisor F \u2032 |S .\nPb1 +m \u2032\nPb1 +m \u2032\nSince |M |S | is composed of a pencil of curves, M |S \u2265 j=1\nFj |S and | j=1\nFj |S |\nis vertical, we see that |M |S | is also vertical, i.e. dimf \u2032 |S (M |S ) = 0. This means\nthat the divisor M |S is vertical with respect to the morphism f \u2032 |S . By taking the\nStein-factorization of f \u2032 |S , one can see that F \u2032 |S is linearly equivalent to a disjoint\nunion of irreducible curves of the same numerical type and F \u2032 |S \u2261 \u03beC where C is\ncertain irreducible curve and \u03be is a positive integer.\n\n\f20\n\nM. CHEN\n\nPp\nPq\n\u2032\nRecall that E \u2032 := i=0 e\u2032i Ei + j=1 dj Lj . We may write E \u2032 |S := EV\u2032 + EH\n\u2032\n\u2032\nwhere EV\u2032 is the vertical part and EH\nis the horizontal part with EH\n* F \u2032 |S > 0.\nNoting that \u03c0 \u2217 (KX + F1 + F2 )|S is nef and big and that M |S is vertical, we see\n\u2032\nthat EH\nis non-trivial. So we have\n\u2032\n.\n\u03c0 \u2217 (KX + F1 + F2 )|S = M |S + E \u2032 |S = M |S + EV\u2032 + EH\nPp\nAlso recall that E := i=0 ai Ei .

This also means\n\u2032\nthat EH\nis irreducible and that it comes from certain irreducible component of E \u2032 .\nFor generic S and F \u2032 , because S|F \u2032 is the movable part of |KF \u2032 |, we see that S|F \u2032\nis an irreducible curve of genus two. This means C = S \u2229 F \u2032 is a smooth curve of\ngenus 2 on S and C 2 = (F \u2032 |S )2 = 0. Thus KS * C = 2, i.e.\n(EV + EH + \u03c0 \u2217 (KX )|S + S|S ) * C = 2.\nNoting that, from (4.5), S|S * C = M |S * F \u2032 |S = 0 and \u03c0 \u2217 (KX ) * C = 1, we have\nEH * C = 1. This also says that EH comes from certain irreducible component Ei\nin E with ai = 1. For simplicity we may suppose that this component is just E0 .\nSo a0 = 1.

Definitely, b = 0\n3\nand 3KX = 4pg (X) \u2212 11, 4pg (X) \u2212 12, 4pg (X) \u2212 13 or 4pg (X) \u2212 14. Noting that\n3\nKX\nis an even number, one excludes possibilities 4pg (X) \u2212 11 and 4pg (X) \u2212 13.\nThe proof is complete. \u0003\n\nCorollary 4.8. Let X be a smooth projective 3-fold with ample canonical divisor.\nThen we have the following Noether inequality\n3\nKX\n\u2265\n\n2\n(2pg (X) \u2212 7).\n3\n\nProof. This is a direct result of Theorem 4.1, Theorem 4.3 and Theorem 4.7. \u0003\nCorollary 4.8 implies Corollary 2. Theorem 4.1, Theorem 4.3 and Theorem 4.7\nimply Theorem 5(1) and Theorem 5(2).\n\n\f22\n\nM. CHEN\n\n5. An appendix\nWe go on proving Theorem 5 in this section.\nProposition 5.1. Let X be a projective minimal Gorenstein 3-fold of general type\nwith only locally factorial terminal singularities. Suppose X has a locally factorial\ncanonical model. If dim\u03c61 (X) = 1and (KF2 0 , pg (F )) = (1, 2), then\n3\nKX\n\u2265\n\n2\n(11pg (X) \u2212 16).\n21\n\n3\nProof. If the movable part of |KX | has base points, then we have KX\n\u2265 2pg (X) \u2212 2\naccording to [Kob, Case 1, Theorem (4.1)] because X is assumed to have a locally\nfactorial canonical model. So we may suppose \u03a6|KX | is a morphism.\nTaking the Stein-factorization of \u03a6|KX | , we get the derived fibration f : X \u2212\u2192\nW . Let M1 be the movable part of |KX | and S1 \u2208 |M1 | a general member. We\nPb1\nmay write S1 \u223c i=1\nFi \u2261 b1 F, where the Fi\u2032 s are fibers of f , F is a general fiber\nof f and b1 \u2265 pg (X) \u2212 1. Because X is minimal, F is a minimal surface. Since X\nhas isolated singularities, F is smooth. Note that we have KF2 = 1 and pg (F ) = 2\nunder the assumption of the proposition. We may also write KX \u2261 b1 F + Z,\nwhere Z is the fixed part of |KX |. According to [Ch2, Theorem 1], we have b :=\ng(W ) \u2264 1 provided pg (X) \u2265 3. From [L], we know that |4KX | is base point free.\nLet S4 \u2208 |4KX | be a general member. Since X has isolated singularities, S4 is\na smooth projective irreducible surface of general type. we see that f (S4 ) = W .\nDenote f0 := f |S4 . Then f0 : S4 \u2212\u2192 W is a proper surjective morphism onto\nW (f0 need not be a fibration). Because f (F ) is a point, F |S4 is vertical with\nrespect to f0 , i.e., dimf0 (F |S4 ) = 0. Now we have KX |S4 \u2261 b1 F |S4 + Z|S4 . Denote\nZ|S4 := ZV + ZH , where\nP ZV is the vertical part and Z\u2032H is the horizontal part.\nWe may write ZH :=\nmi Gi , where mi > 0 and the Gi s are distinct irreducible\ncurves on S4 . We have\n\n(F |S4 * ZH )S4 = (F |S4 * Z|S4 )S4 = (F * S4 * Z)X\n=(S4 |F * Z|F )F = 4(KX |F * KX |F )F = 4KF2 = 4.\nThus mi \u2264 4 for all i. Denote\nD := 4KS4 \u2212 8(b \u2212 1)F |S4 + ZV + ZH .\nWe claim that D * Gi \u2265 0 for all i. In fact, since ZV * Gi \u2265 0 and Gi * Gj \u2265 0 for\ni 6= j, we have\nD * Gi \u2265 4KS4 * Gi \u2212 8(b \u2212 1)F |S4 * Gi + mi G2i\n= (4 \u2212 mi )KS4 * Gi + mi (KS4 * Gi + G2i ) \u2212 8(b \u2212 1)F |S4 * Gi\n= (4 \u2212 mi )KS4 * Gi + mi (2pa (Gi ) \u2212 2) \u2212 8(b \u2212 1)F |S4 * Gi .\nNote that both KS4 and F |S4 are nef. When b = 1, we have pa (Gi ) \u2265 b = 1. Thus\nD * Gi \u2265 (4 \u2212 mi )KS4 * Gi \u2265 0. When b = 0,\nD * Gi \u2265 (4 \u2212 mi )KS4 * Gi + (8 \u2212 2mi )F |S4 * Gi + mi [2pa (Gi ) \u2212 2 + 2F |S4 * Gi ] \u2265 0.\n\n\fINEQUALITIES OF NOETHER TYPE\n\n23\n\nTherefore we get D * ZH \u2265 0. This means\n4KS4 * ZH \u2212 8(b \u2212 1)F |S4 * ZH + (ZV + ZH )ZH \u2265 0.\n\n(5.1)\n\nOn the other hand, we have\nKX |S4 * ZH = b1 F |S4 * ZH + (ZV + ZH )ZH .\n\n(5.2)\n\nCombining (5.1) and (5.2), we get\n4KS4 * ZH + KX |S4 * ZH \u2265 (b1 + 8(b \u2212 1))F |S4 * ZH\n\u2265 4(pg (X) + 10b \u2212 11).\nWe also have\n4KS4 * ZH + KX |S4 * ZH = 5KX |S4 * ZH + 4S4 |S4 * ZH\n2\n\u22645KX |S4 * Z|S4 + 4S4 |S4 * Z|S4 = 84KX\n* Z.\n\nThus we obtain\n2\nKX\n\n1\n*Z \u2265\n(pg (X) + 10b \u2212 11) =\n21\n\n\u001a\n\n1\n21 (pg (X)\n1\n(p (X)\n21 g\n\n\u2212 11),\n\nif b = 0,\n\n\u2212 1),\n\nif b = 1.\n\nFinally we get\n3\nKX\n\n\u2265\n\n2\nb1 K X\n\nThe proof is complete.\n\n*F +\n\n2\nKX\n\n*Z \u2265\n\n\u001a\n\n2\n21 (11pg (X)\n22\n(p (X) \u2212\n21 g\n\n\u2212 16),\n\nif b = 0,\n\n1),\n\nif b = 1.\n\n\u0003\n\nSection 4 and Proposition 5.1 imply Theorem 5(3).\nAcknowledgment\nThis paper was begun when the author was a postdoctor at Georg-August Universitat Goettingen, Germany between October 1999 and August 2000.
