Secondary stars in dwarf novae are strongly irradiated during outbursts. It has been argued that this could result in an enhancement of\nthe mass transfer rate even though the L1 region is shadowed from the primary irradiation by the accretion disc. Previous investigations of the\npossibility of a circulation flow transporting heat from hot regions to L1 gave opposite answers.\nAims. We investigate numerically the surface flow of irradiated secondaries. We consider the full time dependent problem and we account for\nthe two-dimensional nature of the flow.\nMethods. We use a simple model for the irradiation and the geometry of the secondary star: the irradiation temperature is treated as a free\nparameter and the secondary is replaced by a spherical star with a space-dependent Coriolis force that mimics the effect of the Roche geometry.\nThe Euler equations are solved in spherical coordinates with the TVD-MacCormack scheme.\nResults. We show that the Coriolis force leads to the formation of a circulation flow from high latitude region to the close vicinity of the\nL1 point. However no heat can be efficiently transported to the L1 region due to the rapid radiative cooling of the hot material as it enters the\nequatorial belt shadowed from irradiation. Under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium, the Coriolis force could lead to a moderate increase\nof the mass transfer by pushing the gas in the vertical direction in the vicinity of L1 , but only during the initial phases of the outburst (about 15\n\u2013 20 orbital periods). It remains however possible that this assumption breaks up due to the strong surface velocity of the flow transiting by L1 ,\nof the order of the sound speed. In this case however, a three-dimensional approach would then be needed to determine the mass flux leaving\nthe secondary.\nConclusions. We therefore conclude that the Coriolis force does not prevent a flow from the heated regions of the secondary towards the L1\nregion, at least during the initial phases of an outburst, but the resulting increase of the mass transfer rate is moderate, and it is unlikely to be\nable to account for the duration of long outbursts.\nKey words. accretion, accretion disks \u2013 binaries: close \u2013 novae, cataclysmic variables \u2013 stars: dwarf novae\n\n1. Introduction\nDwarf novae (DN) are cataclysmic variables that undergo outbursts, i.e. a sudden increase of their luminosity by a few magnitudes lasting for a few days (see e.g. Warner 1995). It is\nnow widely believed that these outbursts are due to a thermal/viscous instability of the disc triggered when hydrogen becomes partially ionized. In the standard model of DN (often\nreferred to as the DIM, see Cannizzo 1993; Lasota 2001 for\nreviews), the unstable accretion disc performs a limit cycle between an outburst phase of high accretion rate onto the compact\nobject and a quiescence phase of low accretion rate where the\ndisc re-builds. The role of the irradiation of the secondary star\nduring an outburst is still a matter of debate.\nDuring an outburst the secondary is likely to be significantly affected by the strong increase of the accretion luminosity emitted by the primary, as the irradiation flux may exSend offprint requests to:\n\nceed by a large amount the intrinsic stellar flux of the secondary (see Smak 2004a). It has been often argued, but not\nyet demonstrated, that this could result in a mass transfer enhancement that could, if significant, be an essential ingredient\nof the DIM. For example, it has been suggested that irradiation\ninduced mass transfer enhancement is the origin of outburst bimodality (Smak 1999) or that it could play an important role\nin the outburst/superoutburst phenomenon of the SU Uma stars\n(see Hameury 2000; Hameury et al. 2000; Smak 2000).\nHowever, the L1 point is shadowed by the accretion disk\n(Sarna 1990) and thus is not under the direct influence of irradiation. The very existence of a circulation flow transporting\nheated matter from the irradiated region toward the Lagrange\npoint is not clear and one does not know if this results in a\nsubstantial increase of the mass transfer rate.\nThere are some observational clues (see Vogt 1983; Smak\n1995; Smak 2004a) that, in some systems, the mass transfer rate is increased during an outburst or a superoutburst.\n\n\f2\n\nM. Viallet and J.-M. Hameury: Irradiated secondaries in dwarf novae\n\nFig. 1. Profile of the Coriolis parameter f along different meridians of the Roche lobe: \u03c6 = 0\u25e6 (L1 meridian), \u03c6 = 5\u25e6 , \u03c6 = 15\u25e6\nand \u03c6 = 45\u25e6 (from top to bottom). For comparison the profile\ncorresponding to spherical geometry is also shown in dashed\nline.\n\nThese observational arguments have however been questioned\nby Osaki & Meyer (2003), who furthermore argue on theoretical grounds against the possibility of such a mass transfer\nenhancement. First, we do not know how the accretion flux\ninteracts with the secondary envelope and it is not known if\nirradiation can raise significantly the effective temperature on\nthe secondary. Moreover, even in the case where high temperature gradients and therefore high pressure gradients are raised,\nOsaki & Meyer (2003) argue that the strong Coriolis force prevents the formation of a circulation flow transporting heat toward L1 .\nTheir main argument is that the Coriolis force remains significant near L1 , due to the particular shape of the Roche lobe\n(contrary to the spherical case where the Coriolis force vanishes at the equator); its magnitude remains large enough to\ndeflect any meridional flow to what is called a geostrophic flow,\na steady state where velocity field lines are parallel to isobars\n(see Pedlosky 1982). These conclusions were however challenged by computations by Smak (2004a), showing streamlines\nconverging to the L1 region. In subsequent papers, Osaki &\nMeyer (2004) and Smak (2004b,c) developed their argumentation without reaching an agreement.\nOne must note that the geometric argument from Osaki &\nMeyer is a one-dimensional argument, valid on the L1 meridian\nonly. As the L1 point is a singular point in the Roche geometry, the strength of the Coriolis force changes very rapidly as\none moves away from L1 on the equator; this leaves open the\npossibility that the heated material does not follow the shortest\nway along the meridian, but that it follows an \"easier\" way to\nreach the L1 region. Smak (2004a) computations were done in\na two-dimensional steady state and thus account for this effect.\nThe main flaw of both approaches is that the time scale\nto reach a steady state could be long, possibly longer than the\n\nFig. 2. Profile of the Coriolis parameter f on the Roche lobe at\ncolatitudes \u03b8 = 89\u25e6 , \u03b8 = 85\u25e6 , \u03b8 = 75\u25e6 and \u03b8 = 60\u25e6 (from bottom\nto top).\nduration of an outburst, or that such a steady state could never\nbe reached.\nWe investigate here the dynamics of the irradiated envelope by using two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations. We\nadopt a very simple model for the irradiation and geometry of\nthe secondary, but, contrary to Smak (2004a), we solve the full\ntime-dependent problem. Our numerical simulations show that\nthe flow can indeed reach the vicinity of the L1 point, thanks to\n(and not despite) the Coriolis force. However, as hot material\ncrosses the boundary between regions directly illuminated by\nthe primary star and regions shadowed by the accretion disc,\nit cools down so rapidly that any significant heating of the L1\npoint can not be obtained. If vertical hydrostatic prevails, no\nmass transfer enhancement can occur. However, velocity magnitudes of the order of the sound speed are obtained in the\nvicinity of the L1 point and strong vertical velocity gradients\nare thus expected, which could lead to turbulence and/or the\nbreakdown of hydrostatic equilibrium assumption. In this case,\none would need a full 3D analysis of the problem, far beyond\nthe scope of this paper.\nThe paper is organized as follow. We present the model in\nSect. 2 and the numerical code in Sect. 3. Our results are given\nin Sect. 4 and we summarize our conclusions in Sect. 5.\n\n2. The model\nWe consider three models with characteristics of the three DN\nsubtypes. The main physical parameters used are given in Table\n1.\n\n2.1.

The figure shows\na cut along the L1 meridian.\ncompared to the stellar radius, h/R \u226a 1 (even in the vicinity of the L1 point), the vertical dynamical time scale is small\ncompared to all other time scales and the vertical hydrostatic\nequilibrium should be reached rapidly. A 2D approach should\nbe sufficient to investigate the important features of the surface\nflow (see however the discussion in Sect. 4.3 and in the conclusion).\nWe therefore solve the full set of the Euler equations on the\nsurface of the secondary star, whose surface is a Roche equipotential. As these systems have short orbital periods, the Coriolis\nforce is an essential dynamical ingredient. In 2D the Coriolis\nforce enters the equations only via its component parallel to\nthe surface. Its strength is characterized by the Coriolis parameter f = 2\u03a9.n where n is the local normal to the surface. Fig.\n1 shows the profile of f along different meridians of the Roche\nlobe. On the L1 meridian, it can be seen that the Coriolis parameter remains large as stated in Osaki & Meyer (2003, 2004), but\nthe \u03b8 dependance of f becomes more and more similar to the\nspherical case as one moves away from L1 . Fig. 2 show the\nstrong dependence of f on longitude, showing that a 1D calculation is insufficient.\nThe ratio of the inertial force to the Coriolis force is the\nRossby number:\nRo =\n\nV\n,\nfL\n\n(1)\n\nT \u22c6 (K)\n2500\n3500\n4200\n\nT irr (K)\n10000\n10000\n10000\n\n\u03a3irr (g.cm\u22122 )\n350\n200\n250\n\nshadow height\n10\u25e6\n10\u25e6\n10\u25e6\n\nwhere V and L are characteristic values of the velocity and\nlength. In our case the relevant scales are L \u223c R2 , the meanradius of the secondary, V \u223c cs , the sound speed and f \u223c \u03a9,\nyielding Ro \u223c 0.04 for all models (see Table 1). As expected,\nthe Coriolis force dominates the dynamics on the secondary.\nOne should in principle use Roche coordinates (see Kopal\n1969) to describe the secondary surface. For simplicity, we\nconsider a spherical star of radius R2 (the mean radius of the\nRoche lobe) with a space-dependent Coriolis parameter that\nmimics the Roche geometry. This greatly simplifies the problem, as spherical coordinates are much simpler to use than\nRoche coordinates. The mapping between the Roche equipotential and the sphere is illustrated in Fig. 3; we use a Cartesian\nsystem of coordinates where the center of mass of the secondary is at the origin, the center of mass of the primary is\nat (a, 0, 0) with a the orbital separation and the z axis is perpendicular to the orbital plane. The spherical approximation is\npoor in the L1 region, where departure from spherical geometry is the most important. This has two consequences. First\nthe geometrical terms in the Euler momentum equation are not\nwell taken into account. However, in this region, the dynamic\nis dominated by the Coriolis force rather than by geometrical\neffect (note that the Rossby number is also the ratio of geometric terms to the Coriolis one in the Euler equations). Second\nwe underestimate distances: for example the distance from the\nshadow boundary to L1 is underestimated by \u223c 20 \u2212 30% in\nour model (see Fig. 3). This is not a serious difficulty, since it\nis easy to extrapolate our results to a real Roche geometry.\nThe Roche geometry is singular at L1 , but we assume that\nthe stellar surface is at a minimum distance \u2206r = 0.02R2 below\nL1 , comparable to the vertical scale height of the atmosphere.\nWith this assumption, f (\u03b8, \u03c6) is no longer singular, as was the\ncase in Fig. 1, but instead drops sharply for \u03b8 & 85\u25e6 and vanishes exactly for \u03b8 = 90\u25e6 along the L1 meridian (\u03c6 = 0\u25e6 ). The\nresulting f profile does not depend much on q (the binary mass\nratio) and we take here q = 0.1.\n\n2.2. Irradiation\nIt is still debated if the accretion flux can significantly heat the\nsecondary atmosphere; we leave this problem for a future investigation. Here we model the irradiation of the secondary in\na crude, but simple way: we consider that the accretion flux is\ncompletely absorbed and re-radiated as a black body. For convenience, we define T irr as:\nT irr = (Firr (t)/\u03c3)1/4\n\n(2)\n\n\f4\n\nM. Viallet and J.-M. Hameury: Irradiated secondaries in dwarf novae\n\nFig. 4. Time profiles of normal outburst and of superoutburst.\nThe superoutburst profile has the same rise and fall but has a\nlong plateau at maximum.\nwhere Firr is the irradiation flux and \u03c3 is the Stefan-Boltzmann\nconstant. Firr (and consequently T irr ) has a time dependence\nthat account for the temporal profile of the outburst. We denotes by T irr,0 the maximum value of T irr reached during an\noutburst. For simplicity we take T irr,0 = 104 K for all models\n(see Smak 2004a). We use two outburst profiles, a \"short\" one\nlasting 60 orbital periods to model \"standard\" outbursts (note\nthat we are not interested in complex behavior such as the outburst bimodality) and a \"long\" one lasting five times longer in\norder to model superoutburst of the SU Uma subtype (model\n1), see Fig. 4. Because of the crudeness of the model the exact\nshape and duration of our outburst are not of prime importance.\nIrradiation produces a radiative isothermal layer whose column density depends on the irradiation temperature, on top of\nthe convective envelope. Using simple vertical structure models for the secondary, we have computed the expected column\ndensity \u03a3irr of the isothermal layer when T irr = 104 K. The results are given in Table 1. The initial column density is small (a\nfew tens g.cm\u22122 ), because the irradiation flux is negligible, and\nincreases with time during an outburst. For the sake of simplicity, we do not consider the very initial stages of the outburst,\nand assume \u03a3 = \u03a3irr (T = 104 K) as an initial condition. Since\nthe precise value of \u03a3 affects only the thermal time, we want to\nobtain the correct order of magnitude of the cooling time scale\nfor the gas heated at T irr = 104 K.\nThe irradiation flux at a given point on the secondary surface enters as a heating term in the energy equation:\n\u0010\n\u0011\n4\nF+ = \u03c3 T \u22c64 + \u03c8T irr\n(3)\nwhere the intrinsic stellar flux is also included. \u03c8 is a space\ndependent numerical factor accounting for oblique incidence\nand shadowing by the accretion disc on the secondary:\n\u03c8 = (n.u) \u00d7 S (\u03b1 s )\n\n(4)\n\nThe first effect is accounted for by the n.u term, where n is\nthe local normal to the surface and u is a unit vector pointing\n\nFig. 5. Profile of \u03c8 along different meridians on the secondary:\n\u03c6 = 0\u25e6 (L1 meridian), \u03c6 = 5\u25e6 , \u03c6 = 15\u25e6 and \u03c6 = 45\u25e6 (from top\nto bottom). The shadow boundary is located at \u03b8 = 80\u25e6 . Note\nthat polar regions are not irradiated.\ntowards the primary, assumed to be the source of irradiation.\nThe second effect is accounted for by the S (\u03b1 s ) term, where \u03b1 s\nis the angle between the orbital plane and the line joining the\nprimary center of mass and the running point on the secondary:\ntan \u03b1 s = p\n\nz\n(a \u2212 x)2 + y2\n\n(5)\n\nwhere (x, y, z) are the Cartesian coordinates of the running point\n(in the same coordinates system as defined previously). We\nthen assume that the disc has a fixed opening angle \u03b1d (see\nbelow) and we compute S (\u03b1 s ) by:\nS (\u03b1 s ) =\n\n\u03b1 s \u2212 \u03b1d\n1\n)\n(1 + tanh\n2\n\u2206\u03b1d\n\n(6)\n\nwhere \u2206\u03b1d is an angular size controlling the thickness of the\ntransition between the shadowed part and the non-shadowed\npart, taken to be \u2206\u03b1d = 0.5\u25e6 . The hyperbolic tangent function\nenables a smooth transition between \u03b1 s \u2212 \u03b1d \u226a \u2206\u03b1d and \u03b1 s \u2212\n\u03b1d \u226b \u2206\u03b1d .\nWe use the numerical code from Hameury et al. (1998) to\ncompute the vertical structure of the accretion disc during an\noutburst cycle. For each model we determine the maximum\nvalue of the disc opening angle \u03b1d . During an outburst, the\ndisc opening is found to be \u03b1d \u223c 4\u25e6 for model 1 and \u03b1d \u223c 6\u25e6\nfor model 2 and 3. In both cases this translates into a shadow\nboundary located at \u03b8 \u223c 80\u25e6 when measured on the main meridian (the larger opening of the disc in model 2 and 3 is compensated by larger secondaries). The quiescent disc has a much\nlower opening which allows for a much smaller shadowed region at the beginning of an outburst. We have checked that\nwhen the disc enters outbursting state, its opening increases\nvery rapidly. Thus it is a good approximation to suppose that\nthe disc has its \"outbursting thickness\" since the very beginning of the outburst.\n\n\fM. Viallet and J.-M. Hameury: Irradiated secondaries in dwarf novae\n\nWe use the mapping shown in Fig. 3 to project \u03c8 on the\nsphere of radius R2 in order to obtain \u03c8 = \u03c8(\u03b8, \u03c6). Fig. 5 shows\n\u03c8 along different meridians.\n\n2.3. Equations\nWe now turn to the mathematical formulation of the equations.\nWe use spherical coordinates (\u03b8, \u03c6) (\u03b8 is the colatitude and \u03c6\nthe longitude) to map the sphere of radius r0 = R2 . The metric\nproperties of these coordinates are given by the metric tensor:\n\u0012 2\n\u0013\nr\n0\n(gi j ) = 0 2 2\n(7)\n0 r0 sin \u03b8\nij\n\ng denotes the components of the inverse of matrix (7) and g\ndenotes its determinant.\nWe use the following variables: \u03a3 is the gas surface density,\nE, H = E + P, and P are the vertically integrated values of\nthe energy density, enthalpy density, and pressure. v\u03b8 , v\u03c6 are\nthe velocity components. For convenience, we introduce the\nfollowing notations:\n\u221a\n\u2013 \"Barred\" quantities denotes a multiplication by g =\n2\nr0 sin \u03b8. These quantities account for the metric effects; for\n\u221a\nexample \u03a3dS = \u03a3 gd\u03b8d\u03c6 = \u03a3\u0304d\u03b8d\u03c6.\n\u2013 \"Tilted\" velocity components are angular velocity components: \u1e7d\u03b8 = v\u03b8 /r0 = \u03b8\u0307 and \u1e7d\u03c6 = v\u03c6 /(r0 sin \u03b8) = \u03c6\u0307.\n\n1 2\n1\n\u03a3v +\nP\n2\n\u03b3\u22121\n\nFor each simulation, we start with an isothermal envelope with\ntemperature T \u22c6 and surface density \u03a3irr (see Table 1). The envelope is initially at rest, i.e. we neglect the quiescence steady\nsurface flow feeding mass transfer. The order of magnitude of\nthe quiescent flow speed is \u223c 0.01cs (see Lubow & Shu 1975),\nsmall compared to surface velocities found in outburst (see\nSect. 4). Irradiation is then turned on with the temporal profile simulating an outburst or a superoutburst. Our simulations\nspan a time length of 240 Porb .\n\n3.

A radiative cooling term is included in the r.h.s. of the\nenergy equation in addition to the heating term (3).\nThe equations are written in conservative form and differ\nonly slightly from the Cartesian case, with the inclusion of\ngeometric source terms in the momentum equations (in addition to the Coriolis term) and with conservative variables\n(\u03a3\u0304, \u03a3\u0304\u1e7d\u03b8 , \u03a3\u0304\u1e7d\u03c6 , \u0112) that are not physical quantities. We also assume\na perfect gas equation of state:\nP = \u03a3Rg T and E =\n\n2.4. Simulation setup\n\nThe Cartesian-like form of our equations enables us to apply\ndirectly any scheme developed for Cartesian coordinates. Here\nwe use the TVD-MacCormack scheme (see Yee 1987) to solve\nequations (8 \u2212 11) for (\u03a3\u0304, \u03a3\u0304\u1e7d\u03b8 , \u03a3\u0304\u1e7d\u03c6 , \u0112). This scheme is a finite\ndifference predictor-corrector scheme followed by a TVD step.\nThe \"Total Variation Diminishing\" step ensures that non physical oscillations do not appear (see Hirsch 1990). The two step\nnature of the scheme enables second order accuracy in time as\nwell as a second order discretization of the source terms. To obtain second order in space, the spatial discretization alternates\nbetween backward and forward differencing during the predictor and corrector steps. To avoid error accumulation, the order\nof forward/backward differencing is switched at each time-step.\nIn steep gradients region, the TVD step adds a diffusive flux locally altering the scheme order. The sin \u03b8 cos \u03b8 term in equation\n(6) is discretized in such a way that the physical equilibrium (P\n= cst.) is also a solution of the discretized equation.\nDue to the explicit character of the scheme, the numerical\nstability of the scheme is subject to the well known CourantFriedrichs-Levy (CFL) condition; the time step is restricted by\n(see Hirsch 1990):\n\nWith these notations, the Euler equations write:\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u03a3\u0304 +\n\u03a3\u0304\u1e7d\u03b8 +\n\u03a3\u0304\u1e7d\u03c6 = 0\n\u2202t\n\u2202\u03b8\n\u2202\u03c6\n\u2202 11\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u03a3\u0304\u1e7d\u03b8 +\n\u1e20 + \u1e2012 = f \u03a3\u0304\u1e7d\u03c6 + cos \u03b8 sin \u03b8\u1e2022\n\u2202t\n\u2202\u03b8\n\u2202\u03c6\n\u2202\n2\n\u2202 21\n\u2202\n\u1e20 + \u1e2022 = \u2212 f \u03a3\u0304\u1e7d\u03b8 \u2212\n\u1e2012\n\u03a3\u0304\u1e7d\u03c6 +\n\u2202t\n\u2202\u03b8\n\u2202\u03c6\ntan \u03b8\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u2202\n\u0112 +\nH\u0304 \u1e7d\u03b8 +\nH\u0304 \u1e7d\u03c6 = F\u0304+ \u2212 \u03c3\u0304T 4\n\u2202t\n\u2202\u03b8\n\u2202\u03c6\n\n5\n\n(12)\n\nwith an adiabatic index \u03b3 = 5/3 and Rg = R/\u03bc, R being the\nperfect gas constant.\nNote that we do not include viscosity.

We therefore exclude the two polar caps in order\nto avoid difficulties around the poles that are singular points\nin spherical coordinates. This is not a serious problem, as the\npoles are not irradiated (see Fig. 5). The grid point accumulation occurring there would severely restrict the CFL condition.\nIn the following, we choose \u03b80 = 10\u25e6 and we have checked that\nthis particular choice does not influence our results. We use an\nuniform grid with 151 \u00d7 200 grid points and we have checked\nthe effect of numerical resolution for model 1 on a 76 \u00d7 100\nand a 301 \u00d7 400 grid. As expected the low resolution run shows\nsigns of enhanced numerical dissipation and the high resolution\nrun shows a more turbulent behavior as compared to our standard resolution, but the main features and results presented here\nare not significantly modified by resolution effects (changes are\n\n\f6\n\nM.

Results\n\nWe first discuss normal outbursts. As expected, irradiation increases the surface temperature of the secondary and, as a result, pressure gradients form (see Fig. 6). In the presence of\npressure gradients, the flow tends to reach geostrophism where\n\nIn this section, the velocity, density and temperature at L1 refer\nto average quantities computed using a gaussian kernel cen-\n\n4.1.

Left panel: Evolution of the velocity at L1 normalized by the isothermal sound speed (computed with the temperature at\nL1 ) during an outburst (solid line) and a superoutburst (dashed line). The maximum velocity is reached at t = 18 Porb (see Fig.\n7). Right panel: Evolution of the surface density at the L1 point normalized by its initial value surface density during an outburst\n(solid line) and a superoutburst (dashed line).\nthe Coriolis force balances pressure gradients (i.e. velocity is\nalong constant pressure line). This dynamical phenomenon is\nknown as \"Rossby adjustment\" or \"geostrophic adjustment\"\n(see Pedlosky 2003). Initially, vertical pressure gradients drive\na vertical acceleration of the fluid, pushing it towards the equator. However the Coriolis force quickly deflects the flow westwards and this effect is stronger in the vicinity of L1 . This\nleads to an oscillatory pattern of the velocity field (see snapshots at t = 0.7 Porb in Fig. 6) along the shadow boundary of\nthe disc. This pattern drives the flow toward L1 . In addition,\nvertical pressure gradients appearing at high longitude, where\nthe normal irradiation flux drops, are also adjusted and as a result, a clockwise circulation flow sets in. At t = 2.5 Porb (see\nFig. 6), the flow has reached geostrophism. The flow crosses\nisobars only in the close vicinity of L1 , as the Coriolis force is\nweaker there (see Sect. 2.1) and the flow speed larger. Note that\nthe geostrophic state is significantly different from the one expected from the initial pressure gradients; this shows the complexity of the geostrophic adjustment process during which\nboth the flow velocity and the pressure gradients vary, the irradiation flux being the only fixed quantity.\nThe overall situation can be depicted as follows: irradiation\ndrives a giant anti-cyclonic perturbation on each hemisphere of\nthe secondary. Furthermore, the associated clockwise circulation goes through the L1 point. In the same time, an equatorial\njet traveling westwards forms at longitude \u03c6 \u223c \u221260\u25e6 as well as\na weaker eastwards one traveling one at \u03c6 \u223c 60\u25e6 (see snapshots\nat t = 2.5 Porb in Fig. 6).\nAs time goes on, pressure gradients increase with irradiation and, as a result, the circulation strengthens (see Fig. 7 at\nt = 30 Porb , the outburst maximum). The left panel of Fig. 8\nshows the magnitude of the velocity at L1 . The maximum velocity is reached at t = 18 Porb where v\u03c6 \u223c 0.6cs (for symmetry\nreason v\u03b8 = 0). The corresponding snapshot is shown in Fig. 6.\nThe right panel of Fig. 8 shows the evolution of the surface den-\n\nsity at L1 . In the early stage of the outburst, the surface density\nincreases by a few percent as matter is initially driven toward\nthe equator. Later on, it decreases temporarily by a few percents\ndue to the strong surface flow through L1 and as a consequence\nof mass conservation.\nSnapshots at different times (see Figs. 6, 7) show that the\nanti-cyclonic perturbation slowly drifts westward. This is a natural consequence of its clockwise circulation and this shows\nthat no steady state can ever be reached. As a consequence,\nthe circulation flow initially transiting by the L1 point moves\naway from L1 (see left panel of Fig. 8 for t < 50 Porb ). Note\nalso that the temperature distribution at the surface of the secondary is not much affected by the flow, as would be the case if\nheat transport by advection were important. This is an important point that will be discussed in more details later on.\nThe subsequent increase of the velocity at L1 in Fig. 8 (left\npanel, at t \u223c 70 Porb ) is due to the transit of the westwards jet.\nAt the outburst end, the residual circulation flow slowly decays (due to numerical dissipation) on a time scale shorter than\nthe time interval between outbursts; physical viscosity (e.g. due\nto turbulence) would bring the velocity field to zero before the\nnext outburst starts.\nNumerical simulations of a superoutburst shows the same\nfeatures during the initial phase, as expected. Even after t =\n30 Porb , when a normal outburst would have started to decline,\nthe surface flow is not very different in the normal and superoutburst cases, see Fig. 7. Due to the maintained irradiation,\nthe strength of the surface flow does not decay as it does in the\nnormal outburst case. However, the anti-cyclonic perturbation\ndrifts westward in the same way as it does in the normal outburst case, also suppressing the flow transiting by L1 (see left\npanel of Fig. 8). The subsequent evolution shows a turbulent\nlike behavior that slowly decays when the superoutburst ends.\nThe surface density at L1 (see right panel of Fig. 8 is increased\nby at most 20% during a superoutburst.\n\n\fM.

Right panel: Time evolution of the colatitude of each particles.\nThe shadow boundary is at \u03b8 = 80\u25e6 .\nIn order to compare our results with those from Smak\n(2004a), we now follow the trajectories of test particles distributed in the atmosphere and initially at rest. Fig. 9 (left panel)\nshows a few example of such trajectories. Each trajectory lasts\nfor 40 orbital periods. This figure shows that particles initially\nat longitude \u03c6 \u223c 40\u25e6 \u2212 50\u25e6 reach the close vicinity of L1 . The\narrival time in the L1 region can be obtained from the right\npanel of Fig. 9 which shows the time evolution of each particle colatitude. Fig. 10 shows the temperature of each particle\nvs colatitude. The particles are heated during their trajectory\ntowards L1 and they cool down very quickly once they enter\nthe shadowed region. As a consequence, the temperature of the\nL1 point remains very close to its quiescent value (2500 K),\ncontrary to Smak (2004a). The reason for this is that the cooling time scale is shorter than the transit time towards L1 : as\nshown in the right panel of Fig. 9, the time scale for crossing\nthe shadow boundary is of the order of few orbital periods. The\ncooling time scale is:\n\u03c4cool =\n\n\u03a3cv T\n\u03c3T 4\n\n(14)\n\nwhere cv is the specific heat capacity. Thus \u03c4cool \u221d \u03a3T \u22123 with\na very strong temperature dependance. For an initial value \u03a3 =\n350 g.cm\u22122 , \u03c4cool = 9 Porb for T = 2500 K but \u03c4cool = 0.15 Porb\nfor T = 104 K. Consequently as materials heated at T \u223c 104 K\nenters the shadowed region, their very rapid cooling is unavoidable. A more elaborate computation of a T 4 cooling shows that\nafter a few cooling time scales the gas temperature is close to\nthe ambient value. The preceding argument holds even better\nwhen one corrects for the Roche geometry (see Sect. 2): real\ndistances are about 30% larger. The cooling of the gas is so efficient that this conclusion does not depend much on the thickness of the shadowed region (see discussion at the end of Sect.\n2.2) nor on the exact value of \u03a3irr , since it would require unrealistically large values of \u03a3 for \u03c4cool to be of the order of the\ncrossing time scale.\n\nFig. 10. Temperature vs colatitude for each particle (T 0 = 2500\nK, the shadow boundary is at \u03b8 = 80\u25e6 ). Particles cool very\nrapidly as they enter the shaded region.\n\n4.2. Model 2 & 3: U Gem and Z Cam classes\nNumerical simulations with parameters corresponding to U\nGem (model 2) and Z Cam (model 3) show very similar features to the SU Uma case. In particular the time needed for\nparticles to cross the shadow boundary is of the same order as\npreviously found, namely a few orbital periods while the cooling time is unchanged: for the parameters of model 2 and 3\n\u03c4cool \u223c 0.02 \u2212 0.03 Porb (due to larger orbital periods), thus\nshowing that the above conclusion also applies here.\n\n4.3. Mass transfer enhancement ?\nWe now discuss the implications of our numerical results on a\npossible mass transfer enhancement. The mass transfer rate is\n\n\f10\n\nM. Viallet and J.-M. Hameury: Irradiated secondaries in dwarf novae\n\nFig. 11. Vertical profile of the density \u03c1 in the isothermal envelope when v\u03b8 = 0, v\u03b8 = 0.5cs, v\u03b8 = 0.75cs and v\u03b8 = cs (from bottom\nto top), left panel corresponds to zL1 = 1.2H and right panel corresponds to zL1 = 2.H. The density is normalized by the value of\nthe density at L1 when vk = 0.\ngiven by (see Lubow & Shu 1975, Meyer & Meyer-Hofmeister\n1983):\n\u1e40 = Q\u03c1(L1 )cs\nwhere cs is the isothermal sound speed:\nq\ncs = Rg T (L1 )\n\n(15)\n\n(16)\n\nand Q is the cross section of the stream (see Meyer & MeyerHofmeister 1983):\n2\u03c0 \u0010 cs \u00112\n(17)\nQ=\nk \u03a9\nwhere k is a constant which depends only slightly on the mass\nratio q.\nThe factor Qcs yields a T (L1 )3/2 dependence of the mass\ntransfer on the temperature at L1 . If we further assume that\nvertical hydrostatic equilibrium prevails, \u03c1(L1 ) also depends\nT (L1 ) and on \u03a3(L1 ). Our results have shown that T (L1 ) is almost unaffected by irradiation and heat transport. An increase\nof \u03a3(L1 ) by a few percents leads to an increase of \u1e40 by the\nsame amount and is therefore inefficient to increase the mass\ntransfer rate (see right panel of Fig. 8). However, beneath L1\nthe Coriolis force pushes the gas in the vertical direction and\nthis could change the vertical distribution of the mass density.\nIncluding the Coriolis force in the hydrostatic balance gives:\n\u2202P\n= \u2212\u03c1g + \u03c12\u03a9v\u03b8 = \u2212\u03c1geff\n\u2202z\n\n(18)\n\nwhere the z axis now refers to the local vertical axis with the\norigin taken at the base of the isothermal atmosphere, g is the\nRoche gravity and vk is the surface velocity of the gas.\nDue to the Coriolis force, the location where the effective\ngravity vanishes can be lower than the L1 point. In this case,\none should replace \u03c1(L1 ) in Eq. 15 by the density at the point\nwhere the effective gravity vanishes.\n\nWhen vk = 0, Eq. 18 can be solved by expanding g to first\norder around zL1 , the height of L1 (see e.g. Lubow and Shu\n1975), giving:\n\u03c10 (z) = \u03c10 (L1 ) exp((z \u2212 zL1 )2 /H 2 )\n(19)\n\u221a\nwhere H = cs /(\u03a9 A + 1/2) is the vertical scale height of the\nisothermal envelope (A is a numerical factor given in Lubow\nand Shu (1975))\nSince we do not known the vertical profile of vk , we solve\nEq. 18 with v\u03b8 = 0.5, 0.75, 1.0 cs . The results are shown in\nFig. 11. The mass transfer enhancement is directly given by\nthe increase of the density. Results depends on the ratio zL1 /H,\nwhich has to be determined by computing the vertical structure\nof the envelope. This is beyond the scope of the present paper\nand we consider in Fig. 11 two cases: zL1 /H = 1.2 and zL1 /H =\n2.\nIt should be noted that, as the velocity reaches a fraction\nof the sound speed, it is possible that the hydrostatic equilibrium assumption breaks in the whole vertical extend of the envelop. A detailed analysis would require 3D simulations, out of\nthe scope of this paper. However, the main conclusion that the\ncooling time is much shorter than the crossing time of the disc\nshadow will not change.\nFinally, note that a mass transfer enhancement due to the\nstrong surface flow, whatever the mechanism at play, would be\nrestricted to the rise of the outburst or superoutburst (see left\npanel of Fig. 8 for t < 30 Porb ).\n\n5.

Hameury: Irradiated secondaries in dwarf novae\n\ntion triggers a large anti-cyclonic perturbation (i.e. high pressure perturbation) with the associated clockwise circulation\ndue to the Coriolis force. An important result of our numerical\nsimulations is that the Roche geometry naturally leads to a circulation flow transiting by L1 , contrary to naive expectations.\nThis provides a way to transport matter/heat in the vicinity of\nL1 , where matter leaves the secondary. We have also shown\nthat it is necessary to solve the full time-dependent problem\nin order to catch the dynamics of the geostrophic adjustment\nprocess; the flow does not reach the geostrophic state without\nmodifying the background pressure gradients (as is implicitly\ndone in Osaki & Meyer 2003; 2004). It is also important to\nnote that no steady state can be reached on the time scale of an\noutburst or a superoutburst.\nWe modeled the irradiation and radiative cooling of the envelope of the secondary in a very crude way, thus avoiding the\nnecessity of solving the vertical structure of the atmosphere. In\nour model, radiative cooling occurs in a very short time scale,\nmuch shorter than the crossing time scale of the shadowed region. There is thus no efficient heat transport in the vicinity\nof L1 . It is unlikely that this conclusion will change in a 3D\napproach that would also include a more realistic treatment of\nradiative transfer. As a consequence, if hydrostatic equilibrium\nprevails, the only effect that could lead to a moderate enhancement of mass transfer is the vertical Coriolis force. It could\nhowever be possible that hydrostatic equilibrium breaks down\nas the magnitude of the surface flow becomes of the order of the\nsound speed. A 3D approach would then be necessary to determine the mass flux leaving the secondary. Note that we have\nnot considered here the magnetic field of the secondary. For\nthe expected range of intensity, the magnetic field is unlikely to\ndominate the gas dynamics but its influence on the flow could\nbe of some importance. An correct implementation of the magnetic field configuration would however be very difficult and is\nfar beyond the scope of the paper.\nApart from the transport mechanism investigated here, any\nother mechanisms that could directly heat the L1 point would\nalso contribute to an increase of the mass transfer rate. For example the direct heating of the L1 point by the rim of the accretion disc or by the scattering of the accretion luminosity by\noutflowing matter are currently under investigation to check if\nheating of L1 could be efficient. We leave this for a forthcoming\npaper.\nEven if the circulation flow found here were to lead to a\nsignificant increase of the mass transfer rate, this effect would\nnot last longer that 10 \u2212 20 orbital periods, as the anti-cyclonic\nperturbation moves rapidly westwards, quenching the flow\nthrough L1 on a time scale comparable to the rise time of the\noutburst. We would expect in this case no differences between\noutbursts and superoutbursts.\nFinally, it could be tempting to apply these results to soft Xray transients (see e.g. Chen et al. 1997 for a review). In these\nsystems the irradiation flux is larger than in DN by a factor of\norder 103 and consequently T irr \u223c 5.104 K. Such a strong irradiation raises very important pressure gradients and one could\nexpect supersonic velocities. A numerical investigation of this\ncase would need a more robust numerical code.\n\n11\n\nReferences\nCannizzo, J.K. 1993, in Accretion Disks in Compact Stellar Systems,\nWorld Scientific\nChen, W., Schrader, C.R., & Livio, M. 1997, ApJ, 491, 312\nHameury, J.-M., Menou, K., Dubus, G., Lasota, J.P., & Hure, J.M.\n1998, MNRAS, 298, 1048\nHameury, J.M., Lasota, J.P., & Warner, B. 2000, A&A, 353, 244\nHameury, J.-M. 2000, New Astronomy Reviews, 44, 15\nHirsch, C. 1990, in Numerical Computation Of Internal And External\nFlows Volume 2, ed.
