For such applications study of a response\nof nonequilibrium carries is important and very much\nneeded. Both experimental and theoretical studies of\nthe nonequilibrium electron-hole pairs in graphene under interband photoexsitation have been already performed, see [3] and [4, 5] (and references therein), respectively. Experimental investigations of the carries heating\nin graphene by dc electric field were carried out in relation with demonstrations of graphene field-effect transistor (see [6] and references therein). Essential heating\napparently had taken place in experiments on currentinduced cleaning of graphene [7]. In respect to theoretical treatments of the problem, it was investigated the\nrate of energy relaxation of nonequilibrium carries, both\nanalytically [8] and numerically,[9] and also it was discussed a derivation of kinetic equation for a strong field\n[10]. However, to the best of our knowledge, the basic problem of carries heating by dc electric field have\nnot been considered so far and a systematic investigation\nof the non-linear current-voltage characteristics was not\nperformed yet.\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: ftvasko@yahoo.com\n\nIn this paper, we study a heating of electron-hole pairs\nin an intrinsic graphene under dc electric field. To describe heating it is taken into account both increase of\nthe energy of carries in the field, E, and the following relaxation processes: (1) damping of the momentum due to elastic scattering on structural disorder, that\nis the most fast process ensuring weak anisotropy of\nthe distribution function [11], (2) intraband quasi-elastic\nenergy relaxation on acoustic phonons, (3) generationrecombination processes due to interband transitions induced by thermal radiation, and (4) intercarrier scattering due to Coulomb interaction. In present study we\nconsider the heating within two limiting regimes: (I) if\nthe Coulomb scattering is unessential, when it it is possible to neglect by the intercarrier scattering, and (II) the\nCoulomb-controlled case. In the latter case the Coulomb\nscattering imposes the quasiequilibrium distribution on\ncarries, with characteristics defined by balance equations\nfor the density and the energy. In present study we find\nthe distribution function of carries for these regimes and\ninvestigate it dependence on applied field and the temperature of thermostat formed by phonons and thermal\nradiation. In addition, we analyze current-voltage characteristics and the density of nonequilibrium carriers.\nThe character of obtained nonlinear response is determined by a few peculiarities of the considered model.\nFirst, the velocity of carries does not increase with the\nenergy as it is equal vW p/p, where vW = 108 cm/s is\nthe characteristic velocity of charged neutrino-like particles, p is the 2D momentum. Second, the interband\ntransitions are effectively excited by thermal radiation\n(the matrix element of transition is \u221d vW ) they not only\n\n\f2\nchange a carrier concentration but also participate in the\nenergy relaxation. As a result, the nonequilibrium distribution is formed due to interplay between weak energy relaxation and generation-recombination processes\n(i.e., between interactions with phonon and photon thermostats). Third, the rate of energy relaxation sharply increases as p grows, where weak electron-phonon interaction takes place for slow carriers. Therefore for scattering\non short-range defects, when the relaxation of momentum also grows with the energy, it is realized a sub-linear\ncurrent-voltage characteristic with essential nonlinearity\nfor weak fields while as field grows nonlinearity becomes\nweak. If the momentum relaxation becomes ineffective\nfor high energy carriers (because of a finite-range disorder) a super-linear increase of current takes place. In the\nregion of strong fields a linear dependence of current from\nthe field is realized (the second ohmic region of currentvoltage characteristic) where the effective conductivity is\nsmaller than the conductivity of equilibrium carriers for\nlow temperatures, T , and the former becomes larger than\nthe latter as T grows. Because the intrinsic graphene has\nmaximum resistance (with respect to gate voltage), here\nthe Joule heating is least effective so maximal electric\nfield can be applied.\nThe paper is organized in the following way. The basic\nequations describing the heating of carriers in an intrinsic\ngraphene under dc electric field are presented in Sec. II.\nIn Sec. III we examine the symmetric distribution function of nonequilibrium electron-hole pairs for the cases I\nand (II), see above. The current-voltage characteristics\nare analyzed in Sec. IV. The concluding remarks and\ndiscussion of the assumptions used are given in the last\nsection. Appendix contains the evaluation of the quasiclassical kinetic equation for electron-hole pairs under a\nstrong dc electric field.\n\ning there were considered earlier, see [11, 12] and references therein, JLA {f |p} and JR {f |p} were evaluated in\n[5], and Coulomb scattering was considered in [13]. For\nthe distribution function defined by Eq. (1), the concentration balance equation is given as\n4 X\nJR {f |p} = 0,\nL2 p\n\nbecause interband transitions are forbidden not only for\nelastic scattering but also for Coulomb scattering, due to\nsymmetry of the energy spectrum [14], and for phonon\nscattering, due to s \u226a vW ; here s is the velocity of sound.\nIn Eq. (2) the factor 4 takes into account spin and valley\ndegeneracies, L2 is the normalization area.\nTaking into account that electrons and holes equally\ncontribute to the current density, I, one obtains\nI=\n\n\u00df(m)\n\nNonequilibrium electron-hole pairs in the intrinsic\ngraphene are described by coinciding distribution functions fe,hp \u2261 fp as their energy spectra are symmetric\nand processes of scattering there are identical (see Appendix). Therefore instead of system of kinetic equations\nfor fep and fhp it is possible to consider the single kinetic\nequation as\neE *\n\n\u2202fp X\nJj {f |p},\n=\n\u2202p\nj\n\n(1)\n\nwhere E is a strong electric field and the classical form\nof the field term is substantiated in Appendix.

The Coulomb scattering integral\nJC {f |p} can be neglected in Eq.

Also we present the field and temperature dependencies of the nonequilibrium sheet concentration.\nA.\n\nWeak intercarrier scattering\n\nWe start with consideration of the case I, when the\ncarrier-carrier scattering is ineffective. Omitting JC in\nEq.

(14) we use that\nx4 (dfx /dx + fx )x\u2192\u221e = 0, so that fx must decrease for\nx \u2192 \u221e sufficiently fast, and also the density balance\nequation (2). [15] If to integrate Eq. (14) over x from\n0 to \u221e, then for finite electric field besides Eq. (2) we\nobtain additional, proportional to (pE /pT )4 (dfx /dx)x=0 ,\nterm that, certainly, must be equal to zero. Thus, instead\nof Eq. (2), the second boundary condition can be used\nin the following form (dfx /dx)x\u21920 = 0.\nThe numerical solution of Eq. (14) is performed below\nwith the use of the finite difference method and the iterations over non-linear contributions, see [17]. Distribution functions obtained are presented in Figs. 1 and 2 as\nfunctions of the energy for different temperatures, electric\nfields, and lc . For low temperature region, two regimes\nof the modification of a distribution emerge with the increase of field: weak electric fields, (pE /pT )4 /(4\u0393) \u226a 1,\nand strong electric fields, (pE /pT )4 /(4\u0393) \u226b 1.\nAs it is seen from Figs. 1a and 2 in weak fields there is\nessential suppression of the distribution in the region of\nsmall p < pT (as slow carriers are heated very effectively)\nand for large p > pT distribution remains almost equilibrium one. Further, as the field becomes strong, Figs. 1\nand 2 show that the carriers are spread over a wide region\nof energies such that, e.g., at T =4.2 K for E >5 V/cm the\n\n\f4\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n1\n\n2\n\n0.1\n3\n\n3\n\n4\n\n0.0\n\n4\n\n0.0\n\n0.010\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n0.4\n\n1\n\np\n\np\n\n(a)\n\n0.2\n\n2\n\n0.2\n\nf\n\n1\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n6\n\n(b)\n\n2\n\nf\n\n5\n\n0.2\n\n3\n4\n\n0.005\n\n0.0\n\n7\n8\n\n0.4\n\n0.000\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n60\n\n100\n\n120\n\n1\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\nw\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n2\n\np (meV)\n\n0.2\n\n(c)\n\n3\n4\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) Determined from Eq.

Here the equilibrium concentration readily follows from Eq.

The solid and the\ndashed curves are calculated from Eqs. (14), (19) and Eqs.\n(15)-(17), (19), respectively. Inset in panel (a) shows low-field\ndependencies.\n\n(p is the characteristic momentum of hot carriers) conductivity can be expressed through the distribution function of low energy carriers as: \u03c3 \u2243 2\u03c30 fp=0 . As fp=0 =\n1/2 for E \u2192 0, it follows that \u03c30 is the linear (in the absence of heating) conductivity in short-range scattering\nlimit. In Fig. 5 we plot \u03c3/\u03c30 versus field E for lc =10\nnm. Notice, in Figs. 5a-5c, except the inset of Fig. 5a,\nthe same field region is used; it is different from the one\nused in Figs. 5d-5e. It is seen that both approaches give\nsimilar dependences even for very strong field, for given\nT and lc . The dependencies \u03c3/\u03c30 vs E for lc =20 nm\nare plotted in Fig. 6, where conductivity grows faster for\nhigher temperatures.\nNext, we turn to consideration of the current-voltage\ncharacteristics (i.e., the current density I = \u03c3E versus\nfield E). In Fig. 7 we plot the current density, I = \u03c3E,\nversus field E for lc =10 nm at different temperatures.\nSimilar dependencies for lc =20 nm are shown in Fig. 8.\nIt is seen that current-voltage characteristics can be essentially nonlinear already for relatively small E and I\nstarting from 10\u22125 A/cm in the low-temperature region.\nPoint out that for larger E and I (if E \u2265 1 V/cm at\n\n0\n\nE (V/cm)\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\nFIG. 6: The same as in Fig. 5 for lc =20 nm.\n\nlow temperatures and E \u2265 10 V/cm at room temperature) Figs. 7 and 8 will present dependences that are\nclose to linear ones, A + BE. In addition, Figs. 7 and 8\nshow that from both approaches (cases I and II) similar\ncurrent-voltage characteristics are obtained, for given T\nand lc . It is also seen that current-voltage characteristics\ncan manifest as sublinear so superlinear form in wide E\nregions depending on value of T , lc ; these modifications\nof the form are essentially related with the effects due to\nfinite lc .\n\nV.\n\nCONCLUSIONS\n\nTo summarize, we developed the theory of the carries\nheating in intrinsic graphene under strong dc electric field\nfor the cases when intercarrier scattering is negligible or\ndominant. It is found that the deviation from the equilibrium distribution starts from very low electric fields (from\n0.3 V/cm for the room temperature and from 10 \u03bcV/cm\nfor the liquid helium temperature; in particular, for a finite fields dfp /dp tends to zero for p \u226a pE <\n\u223c pT , (while\nfor equilibrium distribution dfpeq /dp \u2248 \u22121/4pT has the\nfinite constant value) due to ineffective energy relaxation\nof slow carriers. Since with the increase of heating this\nrelaxation sharply grows and the recombination of carriers is dominant over the thermogeneration within the\n\n\f7\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n(a)\n\n0.1\n\n2\n\nI (10 A/cm)\n\n(b)\n\n1\n\n-4\n\n-4\n\nI (10 A/cm)\n\n0.0\n\n0\n\n10\n\n(c)\n\n0.0\n3\n(b)\n\n2\n1\n0\n30\n20\n\n5\n\n(c)\n\n10\n\n0\n\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n0\n\n1.0\n\nI (10 A/cm)\n\n1.5\n(d)\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n0.75\n0.50\n\n(d)\n\n0.25\n\n-1\n\n-2\n\nI (10 A/cm)\n\n(a)\n\n0.2\n\n0.1\n\n3\n\n(e)\n\n2\n\n3\n2\n\n(e)\n\n1\n\n1\n\n0\n0\n\nE (V/cm)\n10\n\n20\n\nFIG. 7: Current-voltage characteristics for lc =10 nm at different temperatures: T = 4.2 K (a), 20 K (b), 77 K (c), 150\nK (d), and 300 K (e). The solid and the dashed curves are\ncalculated from Eqs. (14), (19) and Eqs. (15)-(17), (19),\nrespectively.\n\nhigh energy region, it follows that the current-voltage\ncharacteristics should be sublinear for the short-range\nscattering case. The superlinear dependency that is realized in strong fields for scattering on finite-range disorder. Therefore, for intrinsic graphene we obtain unusual\ncombination of the low threshold of nonlinearity and appearance of the second ohmic region for strong fields.\nLet us discuss the main assumptions made. Here it is\nstudied intrinsic graphene which has at most resistivity\nso the effect of heating manifests itself the most. Doped\nmaterials require of separate investigation, moreover nonlinearity in these materials must be weaker. We have restricted ourselves by study only of limiting cases of the\nabsence of intercarrier scattering or dominating Coulomb\nscattering that imposes quasiequilibrium distribution.\nPoint out, that the field dependences of concentration\nand the current-voltage characteristics there are in good\nagreement (the strict solution of the problem should be\nsomewhere between the solutions obtained), i.e., they\nhave weak sensitivity to the details of distribution function. As the main generation-recombination mechanism\nit is assumed radiative-induced interband transitions because Auger-processes are forbidden due to the symmetry of electron-hole states [14]. Possible contribution of\n\n0\n\nE (V/cm)\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\nFIG. 8: The same as in Fig. 7 for lc =20 nm.\n\nother generation-recombination mechanisms (e.g., disorder induced transitions, caused by acoustic phonons or\ncarrier-carrier scattering) demands additional investigation. At last, we consider interaction of carriers with\nequilibrium thermostat formed by acoustic phonons and\nradiation (compare with Ref. 18). The problem of heat\nremoval is beyond of the scope of this paper. We speculate now that heat removal is sufficiently effective [7]. In\naddition, it is possible to use short pulses (all times of\nrelaxation there are < 1 \u03bcs), when the thermostat will\nnot be overheated. These limitations are related with the\nlack of data on graphene, however, the qualitative picture\nwill not essentially modify after taking into account with\nbetter precision of the parameters and the mechanisms\nof relaxation.\nThe rest of assumptions there are standard. To describe the momentum relaxation it is taken into account only the statical disorder scattering using the phenomenological model of Ref. 11 (despite that, it corresponds well the experimental data, the microscopic mechanisms of scattering are still unclear [19]) and small contribution of acoustic phonons is discarded. Using of the\nquasielastic approximation for describing of the energy\nrelaxation is justified by condition vW \u226b s, that ensures\nthe small energy transference for the scattering process.\nAs the energy of optical phonons is large, their contribution can be neglected even in considered strong fields.\n\n\f8\nAlso it is unimportant in considered range of the energies an anisotropy of both electron and phonon spectra.\nInteraction with thermic radiation can be described by\ntaking into account only of direct interband transitions\n(the Drude absorption is small). Therefore, applied approximations accurately describe the heating mechanism\nin graphene and lead to correct quantitative estimation\nof current-voltage characteristics.\nIn conclusion, prospects of many device applications,\nin particular, the characteristics of field-effect transistors or effectiveness of graphene interconnections, are\nsubstantially dependent on the carries heating. In addition, study of hot electrons (holes) gives information\non electron-phonon coupling and about the mechanisms\nof recombination, i.e., makes possible verification of the\nrelaxation mechanisms. Therefore, we believe that the\nobtained results will stimulate further experimental and\ntheoretical study (as well as numerical modeling) of hot\ncarriers in graphene.\nAPPENDIX: KINETIC EQUATION\n\nBelow we evaluate the system of quasiclassical kinetic\nequations governing the nonequilibrium carrier distributions in graphene placed in a strong electric field E. Such\na consideration is analogous to the approach used for the\nbulk narrow-gap semiconductors, see [20]) and the recent\npapers [10] which develop a similar approach for the case\nof graphene. But the case of the bipolar electron-hole\nplasma is not analyzed in these papers.\nWe start from the single-particle density matrix which\nis governed by the quantum kinetic equation [15]:\ni\ni h\n\u0125W \u2212 eE * x, \u03c1\u0302 = Jbcoll .\n(A.1)\nh\u0304\nThe collision integral Jbcoll represents studied above scattering mechanisms and \u0125W is the 2 \u00d7 2 Weyl-Wallash\nHamiltonian, [21] describes states nearby the band crosspoint. Here we use the linear dispersion laws \u03b5lp = lvW p,\nwith l corresponding to the conduction (l=+1) or the valence (l=-1) bands, the eigenvectors |lpi are defined from\nthe eigenstate problem:\n\u0125W |lpi = \u03b5lp |lpi, \u0125W = vW (\u03c3\u0302 * p), (A.2)\n1 \u2212e\u2212i\u03c6\n1\n1\n| \u2212 1pi = \u221a\n,\n| + 1pi = \u221a\ni\u03c6 ,\n1\n2 e\n2\nwhere \u03c6 is the p-plane polar angle.

For typical\nconditions of the applicability of quasiclassical description [13]\n2vW p\u0304 \u226b\n\nh\u0304\n,\n\u03c4c\n\neE\u03c4c \u226a p\u0304\n\n(A.5)\n\nfrom Eq.\n(A.4) we have estimation Fep /Flp \u223c\nh\u0304/(2vW p\u0304\u03c4c ).\nFurther, neglecting by small nondiagonal contributions\nwe arrive to the usual system of kinetic equations:\nX\n\u2202Flp\neE *\nJj {F |lp},\n(A.6)\n=\n\u2202p\nj\nwhich describes the distribution of hot carriers over the\nbands l = \u00b11 and the 2D momentum p. The scattering\nintegrals, Jj {F |lp}, are obtained in Ref. [5, 10]. Here\nl corresponds to conduction (l=+1) or valence (l=-1)\nband, p is the 2D momentum, Jj {F |lp} is the collision integral for the jth scattering mechanism, [j = D, LA, R,\nand C, see discussion after Eq.(1)]. It is convenient to\nmake transition to the electron-hole representation introducing the electron (e) and hole (h) distribution functions, fep and fep , according to the replacements [22]:\nF+1,p \u2192 fep ,\n\n1 \u2212 F\u22121,pt \u2192 fhp\n\n(A.7)\n\nand to rewrite the collision integrals in (A.6) through\nfe,hp .\nFinally, using the substitution (A.7) and the velocity\noperator v\u0302 = i[\u0125W , x]/h\u0304 = vW \u03c3\u0302, we obtain the velocity\nof lp state: hlp|v\u0302|lpi = lvW p/p \u2261 vlp . Taking into\naccount four-fold degeneracy of states in graphene due\nto spin and valley degrees of freedom, one obtains the\ncurrent density\n4e X\n4evW X p\nI= 2\n(fep + fhp ) . (A.8)\nvlp Flp =\nL\nL2 p p\nlp\n\nIn addition, the intrinsic material the electron density is\nequal to the hole one (the neutrality condition):\n4 X\n(fep \u2212 fhp ) = 0.\nL2 p\n\n(A.9)\n\nThus, the symmetric scattering for the c- and the vbands Eqs. (A6), (A8) and (A9) preserve their form\n\n\f9\nwhen fep is replaced by fhp . Thus, the electron and\nhole distributions in the intrinsic material are identical,\n\nfep = fhp \u2261 fp , so that the kinetic equation and the\ncurrent density take forms (1) and (3), respectively.\n\n[1] A.H.
