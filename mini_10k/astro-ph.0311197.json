(1994) discovered intense UV (1100 \u00c5) emission from the direction of the Coalsack Nebula.\nWe have used their results in conjunction with a Monte Carlo model for the scattering in the region to show that\nthe scattering is from dust in the foreground of the Coalsack molecular cloud. We have constrained the albedo of\nthe grains to 0.4 \u00b1 0.1. This is the first determination of the albedo of dust in the diffuse ISM in the FUV.\nKey words. dust, extinction; ultraviolet: ISM\n\n1. Introduction\n\nTable 1. Properties of stars in our model\n\nAlthough a potentially useful test of models of interstellar\ndust grains, measurements of the optical parameters -\nthe albedo (a) and the phase function asymmetry factor\n(g) - of the grains have been too uncertain to have been\nof much utility (for a recent review see Draine 2003a).\nBoth methods used to investigate the scattering properties have been problematic: reflection nebulae because an\nuncertain geometry can heavily influence the derived parameters (Mathis et al. 2002) ; and the diffuse background\nbecause of its faintness and because there is often a tradeoff between a and g which allows neither to be tightly\nconstrained (Draine 2003a).\nThe Coalsack Nebula, one of the most prominent dark\nnebulae in the Southern Milky Way, offers an excellent\nlocation for the determination of the scattering function of the diffuse grains, particularly in the UV where\nMurthy et al. (1994) found it to be one of the brightest\nsources of diffuse emission in the sky. Without detailed\nmodeling, they were unable to provide useful contraints\non the optical constants of the grains but did suggest that\nmost of the observed emission was due to forward scattering of photons from three of the brightest UV stars in\nthe sky (Table 1) by foreground dust, rather than backscattering from dust in the molecular cloud. We note that\nMattila (1970) observed scattering from the Coalsack in\nthe visible which he interpreted as being due to scattering\nfrom the Coalsack.\nIn this paper, we have reinterpreted the Voyager observations of Murthy et al. using improved distances for\nthe three stars, a detailed model for the interstellar dust\ndistribution and a Monte Carlo model for the grain scattering.

Model\nWe have developed a generalized Monte Carlo model to\nsimulate the scattered emission from a star in an arbitrary scattering geometry. Each photon from the star is\nemitted in a random direction and continues in that direction until an interaction occurs, the probability of which\ndepends on the local dust density. At the point of interaction, we reduce the photon's effective weight by a factor\nof a, the grain albedo, and calculate a new direction using\nthe Henyey-Greenstein (Henyey & Greenstein 1941) scattering function:\n\u03c6(\u03b8) =\n\n(1 \u2212 g 2 )\n(1 + g 2 \u2212 2gcos(\u03b8))3/2\n\n(1)\n\nIn Eqn. 1, g is the phase function asymmetry factor (defined as hcos(\u03b8)i) and \u03b8 is the angle of scattering. If g is\nclose to zero, the scattering is nearly isotropic while a value\nof g near 1 implies strongly forward scattering grains.\nWe follow the photon through a sequence of interactions until it either leaves the area we are considering or\nits intensity drops to a negligible value. To save computational time, a part of every photon was redirected to the\n\n\f2\n\nJayant Murthy and P.

In our Monte Carlo model, photons are emitted\nby the star in a random direction and proceed until an\ninteraction occurs. After each interaction, each photon is\nreemitted in a new direction as determined by the scattering function. In order to save computational time, a\npart of the energy at each interaction is redirected to the\nobserver.\n\nobserver at each interaction. This led to a convergence of\nthe model solution in a few million iterations, after which\nthe results were scaled to the stellar output. A schematic\nof our model is shown in Fig. 1.\nFortunately for us, only three early-type stars (Table\n1) dominate the FUV radiation field in the Coalsack. The\nnebula, itself, blocks any light from more distant stars and\nthe other foreground stars are all cool stars with negligible\nFUV emission. We have used data from the Hipparcos catalog (Perryman et al. 1997) to specify the stellar spectral\ntypes, locations, and distances. The flux from each star\nwas calculated using a Kurucz (1979) model scaled to the\nobserved IUE flux at 1500 \u00c5. The total number of photons\nemitted by each star could then be directly calculated.\nThe dust distribution, as usual, is more difficult\nto characterize. The molecular cloud comprising the\nCoalsack is clearly delimited by the CO contours of\nDame et al. (2001) which we have converted into a total hydrogen column density using the N (H2 )/WCO ratio\nfound by Bloemen et al. (1986). We have arbitrarily assumed that the cloud is 1 pc thick, (defined by our bin\nsize) which gives local space densities of between 200 and\n1000 cm\u22123 in the cloud, well within the canonical range\nfor molecular clouds (Spitzer 1988). The distance of the\nCoalsack is between 180 and 200 pc from the Sun (Franco\n1989), behind any of the stars of Table 1. There is virtually no interstellar matter in this direction upto a distance\nof about 40 pc, except for the Local Cloud, which only has\na column density of about 5\u00d71018cm\u22122 (see Frisch 2002).\n\n50\n\n100\nDistance(pc)\n\n150\n\nFig. 2. The hydrogen column density (N(H)) is plotted for\na number of stars (asterisks) in the central 2\u25e6 \u00d7 2\u25e6 of the\nfield. Based on these measurements, we have distributed\nthe dust as shown by the solid line. We use similar plots in\nother regions to constrain the dust over the entire 8\u25e6 \u00d7 8\u25e6\nfield.\nTable 3.

(1994) in Table 3. The main\nsources of uncertainty in the modeling lie in the dust distribution, which may be poorly characterized, and in the\nuse of the Henyey-Greenstein scattering function, which\nhas been found to poorly represent the UV scattering\nof radiation by Draine (2003b).
