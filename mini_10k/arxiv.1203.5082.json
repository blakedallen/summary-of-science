They extend to higher dimensions the idea of\nspace time as emerging from a superposition of cellular complexes, generated as the perturbative expansion\nof a field theory, that is realized successfully in 2 dimensions by matrix models [6]. In this sense they have the\nsame goal of the dynamical triangulations approach to quantum gravity [7]. Indeed, their Feynman expansion\ngenerates a sum over d-dimensional complexes weighted by amplitudes that characterize the dynamical\ncontent of the specific model considered, while the combinatorial structure of the Feynman diagrams follows\ndirectly from the way field arguments are paired in the (interaction term in the) action.\nIn the simplest tensor models [10], the basic object is a rank-d tensor whose indices take values in a finite\nset of dimension N , which can be represented graphically as a (d-1)-simplex with its d (d-2)-faces labelled by\nthe d indices. The action possesses a combinatorially non-local vertex in which d + 1 tensors are coupled by\ntracing over common indices respecting the combinatorial pairing of faces in a d-simplex built by gluing d + 1\n(d-1)-simplices. The amplitudes of such theory, reflecting the simplicity of the data set, are simple functions\nof the combinatorial structure of the underlying simplicial complexes. Still, the models constructed on this\nsimple basis are extremely rich, and a wealth of interesting results have been obtained recently about them\n[3, 12]. These include a detailed understanding of the combinatorial structure of the d-complexes arising in\nperturbative expansion [3, 12], and of the large-N limit of the models [11], the discovery of their symmetries\nin such limit [15], and interesting universality results [16]. Many of these results have been obtained thanks\nto the introduction of colours in the formalism, that is for multi-tensor models in which d+ 1 complex tensors\n(each corresponding to a different \"colour\") enter the fundamental interaction term (thus each d-simplex\nhas (d+1) faces of different colours) and no colour change is allowed during propagation (thus d-simplices\ninteract only through faces of the same colour). Equivalently [12], colours can be replaced by a labelling of\nindices of unsymmetric complex tensors, which are then restricted to have only interactions that satisfy a\n\u2297d U (N ) symmetry (so-called invariant tensor models [12]).\nAnother set of models is obtained when the domain space for the tensorial objects is chosen to be a Lie\ngroup manifold, while keeping the same combinatorial structure of action and Feynman diagrams. This\nvariety of tensorial models goes usually under the name of group field theories (GFT). The group structure\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\u2020 Electronic\n\naddress: sylvain.carrozza@aei.mpg.de\naddress: daniele.oriti@aei.mpg.de\n\n\f2\nbrings in a new set of tools for the analysis or the construction of the models, including for example harmonic\nanalysis [17] and non-commutative Fourier transforms [21, 23]. Most important, as far as quantum gravity\nis concerned, it brings the tensor formalism in direct contact with discrete classical and quantum geometry,\nand with other approaches to quantum gravity, such as loop quantum gravity [8] and spin foam models [9],\nas well as simplicial quantum gravity path integrals [18, 19]. This is true, in particular, for GFT models in\nwhich the fundamental field is assumed to satisfy an additional symmetry property, that is an invariance\nunder the diagonal shift of the d group arguments of the field by the same group element. The first result\nof this imposition is to introduce a coupling between different arguments of the field (the resulting model\nis not independently distributed anymore, in the language of matrix models), which is then reflected into a\nvery different dependence of the amplitudes of the models on the combinatorial structure of the underlying\ncomplex. Another result of this imposition (which can be turned into a modification of the kinetic and/or\ninteraction kernels, rather than of the field itself) is to introduce a gauge connection at the level of the\nFeynman amplitudes, which can be interpreted (when the Lie group is chosen appropriately) as a discrete\ngravity connection and allows then a similar interpretation for the same group arguments of the GFT field.\nThe boundary states (GFT observables) of the model take then the form of holonomy functionals as in\nlattice gauge theory and loop quantum gravity, and their harmonic expansion in group representations turns\nthem into spin networks, identified in loop quantum gravity as candidate quantum states of geometry. The\nreformulation of the same GFTs, via non-commutative Fourier transform, in Lie algebra variables brings\ninstead the simplicial geometry of the same models to the forefront and expresses their Feynman amplitudes\nas simplicial gravity path integrals [23\u201325], on top of allowing the identification of the GFT analogue of\ndiscrete diffeomorphisms [26].\nLast, we mention that the simple tensor and GFT models with trivial (pure mass) propagators can be\nalso understood as the static ultralocal limit of dynamical models which include derivative operators on the\ngroup manifold, and thus are not identically distributed. These type of models, dubbed tensor field theories\nand whose matrix analogue is, for example, the Grosse-Wulkenhaar model [29], were first introduced (with\ndifferent motivations) in the group field theory context in [40]. They have the advantage of allowing a nice\ndefinition of scales in terms of eigenvalues of the kinetic operators, that give rise to a genuine renormalization\ngroup flow. Indeed, they have been argued to arise from the radiative corrections of topological (and\nultralocal) GFT models [46], and, more recently, some simple models of this type in both 3 and 4 dimensions\n(with U (1) group) have been shown to be renormalizable to all orders in perturbation theory [30, 31].\nRenormalization is indeed one of the aspects of group field theories that is currently at the centre of\nmuch research activity. Establishing renormalizability of interesting models for quantum gravity is crucial\nfor considering them as well-posed field theories, and a better understanding of their renormalization flow\nwill help characterizing their properties at different scales and in different regimes. It is also important for\ntesting the critical behaviour of tensor and group field theories and, possibly, realizing the geometrogenesis\nhypothesis [4, 5] , that is the hypothesis that a continuous extended spacetime emerges as a result of a phase\ntransition of an underlying model of this type (as it happens in matrix models1 ).\nA crucial ingredient for any study of group field theory renormalization is a good understanding of the\nscaling behaviour and divergence structure of GFT amplitudes, and thus of the GFT sum over complexes\nwhich includes not only all simplicial regular topologies, but also singular configurations that do not satisfy\nmanifold conditions because they contain conical singularities. Many power counting results have been\nproven recently, with a special focus on topological group field theories [11, 13, 30, 41, 45]. These include:\nvery general power counting theorems based on the lattice gauge theory formulation of the GFT Feynman\namplitudes [45], showing how these amplitudes depend on both topological properties (e.g. the fundamental\ngroup) of the corresponding cellular complex and on the details of its combinatorial structure; the scaling\nbounds that are at the root of the results on the large-N limit of such models [11], in which we now\nknow that only a restricted class of complexes corresponding to spherical manifolds dominate; analyses\ntargeting restricted, more focused topological issues like the relative weight of pseudomanifolds over manifolds\n\n1\n\nSee also [32] for the first such proposal in a different context, and [47] for the first attempt to extract possible phenomenological\nconsequences of this scenario in early cosmology\n\n\f3\nin the GFT perturbative expansion [13]. Answering these questions is crucial for considering tensor and\nGFT models as physical models of quantum space, given that the smooth structure and trivial topology\nof macroscopic space has to be explained, rather than assumed, in a formalism that includes more general\ndiscrete configurations in its microscopic dynamics; it is also a test for the growing maturity of this field,\nsince it is exactly the difficulties in tackling them that stopped further progress in the early days of tensor\nmodels.\nThe work presented in [13] is interesting for another reason as well. Just as the analysis of [45], it rests\nentirely on the geometric interpretation of both the GFT field and action, and of the resulting Feynman\namplitudes. Thus its results depend crucially on the added structures and, most important, on the added\nsymmetries of such GFT models as compared to the simple tensor models, for which we are not aware\nof similar results. In particular, it uses a reformulation of the same field theory in which the arguments\nof the field (corresponding to a triangle in 3d) label vertices rather than edges of the same triangle, a\nreformulation that was in turn suggested by the analysis of symmetries in GFT [27], and especially discrete\ndiffeomorphisms [26], which act indeed as local translations of such vertices. In this reformulation, the GFT\namplitudes factorize differently than in edge variables and in particular put to the forefront the bubble\nstructure of the underlying complex, making the analysis of its possible conical singularities straightforward.\nIn this paper we build on this earlier result in two ways. First, we perform again the same construction of\n[13] for the 3d (Boulatov) model [37] in a different regularization, which allows a simpler proof of the bubble\nbound, showing generic suppression of pseudomanifolds; for the same model, then, we show how the vertex\nformulation also allows a proof of new jacket bounds that end up being actually stronger than the ones on\nwhich the large-N results were based [11]. Second, we generalize the analysis to the 4d (Ooguri) model [38].\nIn this context, the relevant reformulation, that we detail, involves going from variables associated to the\ntriangles on the boundary of the tetrahedron corresponding to the GFT field to variables corresponding to\nits edges. Again this is suggested by the topological symmetry studied at the GFT level in [26]. Using\nthis reformulation, we can then take advantage of the modified factorization of the GFT amplitudes to\nprove the 4d generalization of the above results for the 3d model: a bubble bound showing how singular\npseudomanifolds are suppressed with respect to the leading order, and a stronger jacket bound.\nIt is interesting to point out also that, as we will notice again in the following, the structure of the\nGFT amplitudes in our vertex/edge reformulation matches nicely the one obtained from the effective 1colour dynamics of the underlying coloured GFT. Finally, we notice that the construction we present can be\ngeneralized to higher dimensions, so we expect that interesting bounds in any dimensions could be recovered\nrecursively, in the same way as we obtain here the jacket bound in 4d from bounds in 3d; also, because our\nproofs do not rely on invariance of the amplitudes under so-called dipole moves (that are often crucially used\nin dealing with tensor model amplitudes) nor on other forms of topological invariance, they can therefore be\nexpected to be more relevant for non-topological models like those for 4d quantum gravity [24, 25, 28]. We\nreturn to the possible extensions of our results for GFT models of 4d gravity in the conclusions.\nII.\n\n3D CASE: THE BOULATOV MODEL\n\nIn this section, we start by recalling the construction of the vertex representation of the Boulatov model,\nintroduced in [26] and further developed in [13]. We then use this representation to derive various scaling\nbounds, including bounds on singularities as in [13, 14], and also jacket bounds, which dictate the 1/N\nexpansion of the model [11]. Interestingly, our method allows to prove a stronger bound than the usual one.\nThe decay we will obtain is indeed governed by the maximal genus possessed by the jackets of a given graph,\nas opposed to the average of their genera. The second improvement with respect to [13] is due to the use\nof a heat-kernel regularization instead of sharp cut-offs, which improves the clarity of the presentation and\nsimplifies the derivation of our results.\n\n\f4\nA.\n\nVertex representation\n\nThe coloured Boulatov model [20] can be defined by the action:\nS[\u03c6l ] = Skin [\u03c6] + Sint [\u03c6],\nZ\n4\nX\n1\nSkin [\u03c6l ] =\n[dgi ]3\n\u03c6l (g1 , g2 , g3 )\u03c6l (g1 , g2 , g3 ),\n2\nl=1\nZ\nSint [\u03c6l ] = \u03bb [dgi ]6 \u03c61 (g1 , g2 , g3 )\u03c62 (g3 , g5 , g4 )\u03c63 (g5 , g2 , g6 )\u03c64 (g4 , g6 , g1 )\nZ\n+ \u03bb [dgi ]6 \u03c61 (g1 , g2 , g3 )\u03c62 (g3 , g5 , g4 )\u03c63 (g5 , g2 , g6 )\u03c64 (g4 , g6 , g1 ).\n\n(1)\n(2)\n\n(3)\n\nThe four complex fields \u03c6l , labelled by a colour index l \u2208 {1, * * * , 4}, are defined on SU(2)3 . They are interpreted as quantized triangles, and their SU(2) variables as parallel transports of an su(2) connection along\npaths going from the centre of each triangle to the centre of one of its edges. This geometric interpretation\nis implemented via the following gauge invariance under the diagonal action of SU(2):\n\u2200h \u2208 SU(2),\n\n\u03c6(hg1 , hg2 , hg3 ) = \u03c6(g1 , g2 , g3 ).\n\n(4)\n\nThe action itself has the following geometrical interpretation: the interaction terms encode the gluing of\nfour triangles along their edges so as to form a tetrahedron, and the kinetic terms identify triangles of the\nsame colours (see Fig. 1 for pictorial representation as stranded diagrams). In the perturbative expansion\nof the models, these two elementary operations will generate simplicial complexes labelling the Feynman\namplitudes, which we will wish to interpret as discrete spacetimes.\n\nl=1\n1 2 3\n\n1\nl=4 6\n4\n\n3\n5\n4\n\nl=2\n\n6 2 5\nl=3\n\n(a) Kinetic term\n\n(b) Interaction term\n\nFIG. 1: Kinetic and interaction kernels represented as stranded graphs.\n\nFor clarity of the presentation, we will restrict in the following to functions on SO(3) \u223c SU(2)/Z2 , identified\nas functions f on SU(2) such that f (g) = f (\u2212g) for all g \u2208 SU(2). This will allow us to use a group Fourier\ntransform [21], which is bijective in the case of SO(3), but not in the case of SU(2). Note however that we\ncould work with the full SU(2) group, at the price of using the generalised Fourier transform introduced in\n[22]. As this would introduce heavy notations without changing the conclusions of the present paper, we\nrefrain from doing so and work within the simplified framework.\nThe group Fourier transform for SO(3) maps functions f \u2208 L2 (SO(3)) to functions f\u02c6 defined on the Lie\nalgebra so(3) \u223c R3 :\nZ\nfb(x) \u2261 dgf (g)eg (x) ,\n(5)\n\n\f5\nwhere eg are plane-waves, i.e maps from so(3) to U(1).

We will adopt the following, frequently used, definition:\n\u2200g \u2208 SU(2) ,\n\neg : x 7\u2192 ei Tr(xg)\n\n(6)\n\nwhere Tr is defined in terms of the usual trace tr on 2 \u00d7 2 matrices as: Tr(xg) = sign(trg)tr(xg). The image\nof the Fourier transform is endowed with a non-commutative structure, given by a \u22c6-product, defined on\nplane-waves as:\n\u2200g1 , g2 \u2208 SU(2) ,\n\neg1 \u22c6 eg2 \u2261 eg1 g2 ,\n\n(7)\n\nand extended by linearity to the whole image of the Fourier transform. This \u22c6-product reflects the group\nstructure of SU(2), and has the important property of being dual, under group Fourier transform, to the\nconvolution of functions in L2 (SO(3)), in the sense that:\n\u0014Z\n\u0015\nZ\n\u0011\n\u0010\ndg\n\u2200f1 , f2 \u2208 L2 (SO(3)) ,\nfb1 \u22c6 fb2 (x) =\ndhf1 (gh\u22121 ) f2 (h) eg (x)\n(8)\n\nwhich also implies that integral of the point-wise product of two functions on the group manifold is dual\nto the integral over R3 of the \u22c6-product of their Fourier transforms:\nZ\nZ\n\u0011\n\u0010\n\u22121\n(9)\ndgf1 (g )f2 (g) = dx fb1 \u22c6 fb2 (x) .\n\nThis duality allows to express the Boulatov model as a non-commutative field theory, with fields defined on\nthree copies of so(3), and an action with the same combinatorial structure as in group space, expect that\npoint-wise products are replaced by \u22c6-products (under integration). We refer to [23, 26] for details.\n\nExploiting symmetry considerations put forward in [26], the Boulatov model has been reformulated in\nterms of group or algebra data associated to the vertices of the quantum triangles [13], as opposed to the\nedges in the usual formulation. One can map any left-invariant field \u03c6 \u2208 L2 (SO(3)3 ) to a function \u03a5[\u03c6] of\nthree so(3) elements, defined as:\nZ\n\u03a5[\u03c6](v21 , v13 , v32 ) \u2261 dg1 dg2 dg3 \u03c6(g1 , g2 , g3 )eg2-1 g1 (v21 )eg1-1 g3 (v13 )eg3-1 g2 (v32 ) .\n(10)\nThe variable vij is interpreted as a position variable for the vertex shared by the edges i and j, and generates a (quantum group) symmetry which, at the level of the amplitudes, induces the well known discrete\ndiffeomorphism symmetry of discrete BF theory.\nThe geometry behind this reformulation, and the resulting symmetry is the following. The intrinsic\ngeometry of a triangle in R3 is fully characterized, up to rotations, by specifying three edge vectors constrained\nto close (this corresponds to the usual formulation of the model in terms of Lie algebra elements associated\nto edges of the triangle) or the three positions of its vertices. Of course, a simultaneous translation of all\nvertices simply corresponds to a change of the origin of the coordinates in R3 and should be immaterial, as\nfar as the geometry is concerned. This is indeed the case. In fact, the function \u03a5[\u03c6] is itself invariant under\nsimultaneous translations of its variables. Because this translation is given by a quantum group acting on\nproducts of representations, in order to define it properly we need to specify an ordering of the arguments\nof the field. We therefore interpret \u03a5[\u03c6] as a tensor product of representations:\nZ\n\u03a5[\u03c6] = dg1 dg2 dg3 \u03c6(g1 , g2 , g3 )eg2-1 g1 \u2297 eg1-1 g3 \u2297 eg3-1 g2 .\n(11)\nNotice that specifying the ordering of the three arguments of the field is itself equivalent to specifying a\ncolouring of the fields entering the GFT action, and thus of the stranded diagrams generated by it [12].\nIntroducing the translation T\u03b5 , defined on tensor products of plane-waves by:\nT\u03b5 \u22b2 (eg1 (x1 ) \u2297 * * * \u2297 egN (xN )) \u2261 \u22c6\u03b5 (eg1 (x1 + \u03b5) \u2297 * * * \u2297 egN (xN + \u03b5)) \u2261 eg1 ***gN (\u03b5) (eg1 (x1 ) \u2297 * * * \u2297 egN (xN )) ,\n(12)\n\n\f6\nwe immediately verify that:\nT\u03b5 \u22b2 \u03a5[\u03c6](v21 , v13 , v32 ) = \u03a5[\u03c6](v21 , v13 , v32 ) .\n\n(13)\n\nOne can prove that the transformation map \u03a5 is a bijection between the space of left-invariant functions in\nL2 (SO(3)3 ) and its image, that is the set of functions of three so(3) elements invariant under T\u03b5 . We will not\ndetail this point here, but the analogous transformation will be detailed for the 4d case in the next section.\nThis property ensures that the theory can fully be formulated in vertex variables. The net result can be\nexpressed with group variables Gij \u2261 gi-1 gj , Fourier duals of the vij . In this space, the configuration fields\nare distributions \u03c8el of the form:\n\u03c8el (G1 , G2 , G3 ) = \u03b4(G1 G2 G3 )\u03c8l (G1 , G2 , G3 ) ,\n\n(14)\n\nwhere \u03c8l are regular functions. We refer to [13] for more details of this reformulation. In terms of the newly\ndefined fields, the action takes the form:\nZ\n1X\nS[\u03c8] =\n[dGli ]\u03c8l (Gl1 , Gl2 , Gl3 )\u03b4(Gl1 Gl2 Gl3 )\u03c8 l (Gl1 , Gl2 , Gl3 )\n2\nZl Y\n+ \u03bb [\ndGll\u2032 ]V(Gll\u2032 )\u03c81234 \u03c82431 \u03c83412 \u03c84132\n(15)\nl6=l\u2032\n\nZ Y\n431 412 132\ndGll\u2032 ]V(Gll\u2032 )\u03c8 234\n+ \u03bb [\n1 \u03c82 \u03c83 \u03c84 ,\nl6=l\u2032\n\nwith the notation convention \u03c8lijk \u2261 \u03c8l (Gli , Glj , Glk ), and a vertex function defined by:\nV(Gll\u2032 ) = \u03b4(G12 G13 G14 )\u03b4(G24 G23 G21 )\u03b4(G34 G31 G32 )\u03b4(G41 G43 G42 )\n\u03b4(G42 G32 G12 )\u03b4(G43 G13 G23 )\u03b4(G14 G34 G24 ).\n\n(16)\n\nThe notations in the vertex function are as follows: upper indices label triangles or equivalently fields, and\nlower indices are associated to vertices, with the convention that a colour l labels the vertex opposite to the\ntriangle of the same colour l (see Fig. 2a).\nNotice the appearance of a kernel of the kinetic term (i.e. the distributional part of the fields \u03c8el ). This\nis the Fourier dual of the translation invariance of the fields we described in the Lie algebra representation.\nIt is interpreted as a consistency constraint on the three group elements associated to a quantized triangle:\ntheir ordered product needs by construction to be trivial.\nThe vertex function consists (first line) in the same distributional factors of the fields \u03c8el , imposing the\nmentioned consistency conditions, while the second lines are flatness conditions associated to paths around\nthe vertices of the tetrahedra, hence guaranteeing flatness of the connection in the boundary of the tetrahedron (see Fig. 2). Note that only three of these flatness constraints appear in the interaction kernel,\nwhile a tetrahedron has four vertices. This is obviously because only three of these flatness constraints are\nindependent. We can therefore choose any triplet of these four constraints1 to express the same distribution,\nimplementing all four constraints.\nWe define the quantum theory via a partition function Z, defined by a path integral over the space of\nconfiguration fields \u03c8el , weighted by the exponential of (minus) the action S. To make sense of this integral\nover a space of distributions, we resort to the use of a non Gaussian measure \u03bcP over the space of regular\nfields \u03c8l whose covariance is given by the kernel of the kinetic term:\nZ\n6\nY\nd\u03bcP (\u03c8, \u03c8) \u03c8l (g1 , g2 , g3 )\u03c8l\u2032 (g1\u2032 , g2\u2032 , g3\u2032 ) \u2261 \u03b4(g1 g2 g3 ) \u03b4l,l\u2032\n\u03b4(gi gi\u2032-1 ) .\n(17)\ni=1\n\n1\n\nThe fourth one, associated to the vertex of colour 1 being simply \u03b4(G21 G31 G41 ).\n\n\f7\n\n(a) Coloring of vertices\n\n(b) Holonomy variables\n\nFIG. 2: Coloring conventions and group variables associated to one tetrahedral interaction.\n\nFIG. 3: Combinatorics of the interaction in vertex variables, in a form suitable for factorization of bubbles\nof colour 1.\nThis combines the ill-defined measure over the fields \u03c8el with the Gaussian part of the integrand into a\nwell-defined measure over the fields \u03c8l . Only the exponential of the interaction part of the action remains\nto be integrated, to give a suitable definition of Z:\nZ\n(18)\nZ \u2261\nd\u03bcP (\u03c8, \u03c8) e\u2212V [\u03c8,\u03c8]\nZ\nV [\u03c8, \u03c8] \u2261 \u03bb [dG] \u03b4(G42 G32 G12 )\u03b4(G43 G13 G23 )\u03b4(G14 G34 G24 ) \u03c81234 \u03c82431 \u03c83412 \u03c84132 + c.c.\n(19)\nA couple of remarks are in order. First, only the flatness part of the kernel of the interaction has been used\nin the definition of V . This is because the distributional nature of the configuration fields \u03c8el has already\nbeen taken care of in the measure. Were we to integrate Sint and not V , we would pick up products of equal\ndistributions in the amplitudes, hence further divergences. Second, at this formal level, which of the four\nflatness constraints we use to define V does not matter (see the resulting graphical representation in Fig.\n3). In the regularized theory, to which we turn in the next subsection, this is not the case, and we expect\ndifferent choices to give amplitudes with the same scaling behaviour but differing by factors of order 1 (in the\ncut-off). That is why, contrary to the regularization chosen in [13], we use here a symmetric regularization\nin the colour indices.\n\n\f8\nFormally, we can expand the partition function as a power series in \u03bb\u03bb:\nZ=\n\nX\nG\n\nAG\n.\nsym(G)\n\n(20)\n\nwhere each amplitude AG is a monomial in the expansion parameter, labelled by a Feynman graph G, and\nsym(G) is the order of the set of automorphisms of the same graph.\nBefore moving on to the analysis of these amplitudes, let us summarize some properties of the diagrams\nemerging in the above perturbative expansion.\n\u2022 The main point of the introduction of colours in GFT is that the Feynman graphs are (in this 3d case)\n4-coloured graphs, which are well-studied objects in combinatorial topology [33\u201335]1 . We will call lines\nand nodes the elementary objects of these graphs, as opposed to edges and vertices which will be used\nto describe elements of their dual simplicial complexes.\n\u2022 Each line of a 4-coloured graph is associated to a field of a given colour, and two types of 4-valent nodes\ncorrespond to the two interaction terms in V , hence two types of tetrahedra. This point additionally\nmakes the graphs bipartite, and orientable.\n\u2022 These 4-coloured graphs, encoding gluings of tetrahedra along their boundary triangles are generically\ndual to oriented simplicial complexes of a special kind, called pseudomanifolds [39]. They are a generalization of triangulated manifolds, that can be topologically singular at the vertices of the triangulation,\nin the sense that the neighbourhood of a vertex does not need to be homeomorphic to a 3-ball.\n\u2022 Moreover, any lower dimensional simplex of the simplicial complex is dual to a subgraph of the graph\nG. In particular, vertices of colour l2 are in one-to-one correspondence with connected components of\nthe graph obtained from G after deleting all the lines of colour l. Each such component is called a\n3-bubble (or residue in the mathematical literature).\n\u2022 As a 3-coloured graph, this 3-bubble is dual to a triangulated closed surface around the dual vertex.\nA property of special relevance to this paper is that a 3-bubble is a 2-sphere if and only if its dual\nvertex is regular. Therefore, a simplicial complex generated by our perturbative GFT expansion is a\nmanifold if and only if all the 3-bubbles of its dual 4-coloured graph are dual to 2-spheres.\n\u2022 In the same way, one generally has a notion of k-bubbles, obtained by deleting (4 \u2212 k) colours, and\ndual to k-simplices. Since we are mainly interested in the triangulated surfaces dual to the 3-bubbles,\nwe will simply call them bubbles throughout the discussion of the 3d model.\nIn [13], a factorization of the integrand of the amplitudes in terms of bubble contributions was proven.\nFor any colour l, one can indeed express the amplitude associated to a graph G of order N as:\n\uf8eb\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\uf8f6 \uf8eb\n\uf8f6\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nZ\n\u2212\u2212\n\u2212\u2192\n\u2212\n\u2192\nY Y\nY\nY\nY\nf\nN\n3N\nAG = (\u03bb\u03bb) 2 [dG] 2 \uf8ed\n\u03b4\uf8ed\n\u03b4 \uf8ed Gfv \uf8f8\uf8f8 ,\n(Gfv )\u01ebv \uf8f8\uf8f8 \uf8ed\n(21)\nb\u2208Bl v\u2208Vb\n\nf \u2208\u25b3bv\n\nf \u2208Fl\n\nv\u2208f\n\nwhere Bl is the set of bubbles of colour l, Vb the set of vertices in a bubble b, \u25b3bv the set of triangles in a\nbubble b that share one of its vertices v, and finally Fl is the set of triangles of colour l in the complex.\nThe geometrical interpretation of this expression is very natural: the bubble terms in the first parenthesis\nencode flatness around each of the vertices of the triangulated surface, and the terms in the second parenthesis\nencode the consistency conditions in triangles of colour l.\n\n1\n2\n\nSee also [43], in which some of the results are translated in a GFT language.\nRecall that we label both triangles and vertices opposite to them in each tetrahedron with the same colour label l.\n\n\f9\nOne thus obtains an effective description of the model in terms of triangulated 3-cells whose boundaries\nhave colour l, the bubbles.\nIn Fig. 4, we illustrate this result by showing a portion of a bubble b, dual to a vertex vb . The effective\ninteraction term associated to b imposes a trivial holonomy around the vertex v \u2208 b.\n\nFIG. 4: Portion of a bubble b dual to vb : in \u25b3bv , the holonomy around v is imposed to be trivial.\n\nIn the regulated theory, this factorization allows to derive nice bounds on the amplitudes: on the one\nhand, one can understand the effect of singularities at vertices of colour l, as was already proven in [13]; on\nthe other hand, one can derive so-called jacket bounds, which give information about the global topology of\nthe 4-coloured graph, and of its dual simplicial complex (in fact, they were crucial to the discovery of the\n1/N expansion of tensor and GFT models).\nB.\n\nRegularization and general scaling bounds\n\nThe regularization we will use in this paper will differ from the one used in the previous work [13] in\nfl fields, as we will show that\ntwo respects: a) we will only regulate what corresponds to the dynamics of \u03c8\namplitudes are finite without any regularization of the distributional factors they contain, which are encoded\nin the measure \u03bcP ; b) instead of a sharp cut-off in the harmonic expansion of the \u03b4-functions, we will use\nheat-kernels. Let us elaborate a bit on this second point. The \u03b4-function on SU(2) expands as:\nX\n\u03b4(g) =\n(2j + 1)\u03c7j (g) .\n(22)\nj\u2208 N2\n\nOn the other hand, the heat-kernel at time t > 0 on SU(2) is given by:\nX\n\u03b4t (g) =\n(2j + 1)e\u2212tj(j+1) \u03c7j (g) ,\n\n(23)\n\nj\u2208 N2\n\nwhere \u03c7j are the characters of SU(2). We see that \u03b4t converges to the \u03b4-distribution when t \u2192 0, and\ntherefore provides us with a regularization of the \u03b4-function. The three properties of this regularization we\nwill use in this paper are the following. First, \u03b4t is a positive function, which will be very convenient for\nbounding amplitudes. Second, these functions behave nicely with respect to the convolution product:\nZ\n(24)\ndg\u03b4t1 (g1 g -1 )\u03b4t2 (gg2 ) = \u03b4t1 +t2 (g1 g2 ) .\nFinally, when t \u2192 0, we have the following asymptotic formula:\n\u03b4t (g) \u223c \u039bt 3 e\u2212\nt\u21920\n\n|g|2\n4t\n\n,\n\n(25)\n\nwhere |g| is the Riemannian distance between g and the identity, and \u039bt \u2261 (4\u03c0t)\u22121/2 . In particular we will\nuse the fact that \u03b4t (1l) \u223c \u039bt 3 at small t.\n\n\f10\n\nWe define the regularized theory by the following partition function:\nZ\nZt \u2261\nd\u03bcP (\u03c8, \u03c8) e\u2212Vt [\u03c8,\u03c8]\n(26)\nZ\n\u03b4t (G21 G31 G41 )\u03b4t (G42 G32 G12 )\u03b4t (G43 G13 G23 )\u03b4t (G14 G34 G24 ) 234 431 412 132\n\u03c81 \u03c82 \u03c83 \u03c84 + c.c. (27)\nVt [\u03c8, \u03c8] \u2261 \u03bb [dG]\n\u03b4t (1l)\nBefore moving on to the analysis of the regularized amplitudes, let us discuss briefly the role of the\nregularization chosen. Note, in fact, that we have chosen a symmetric regularization in the colours, hence\nthe re-introduction of the flatness constraint around the vertex of colour 1, together with the appropriate\nrescaling. The main advantage of such a symmetric regularization is that discussing bounds from different\nbubble factorizations will be made easier, as will be detailed shortly.\nOn the one hand, this regularization is slightly different from the natural scheme one would use in edge\nvariables (see for instance [46], which also largely motivated the heat-kernel regularization used in this paper).\nThis is because it does not correspond to a regularization of the \u03b4-functions imposing flatness of the wedges\ndual to edges in the GFT interaction vertex (thus encoding the piece-wise flatness of the simplicial complexes\ngenerated in the GFT expansion). On the other hand, regularizations that make bubble factorizations explicit\nafter transformation to edge variables are very natural also when these last ones are used. For example, we\ncould use a non-symmetric regularization of the interaction\nZ\n1\nVt [\u03c8, \u03c8] \u2261 \u03bb [dG] \u03b4t (G42 G32 G12 )\u03b4t (G43 G13 G23 )\u03b4t (G14 G34 G24 ) \u03c81234 \u03c82431 \u03c83412 \u03c84132 + c.c,\n(28)\nwhich allows to write the amplitude in a factorized form similar to (21), with l = 1. This corresponds\nexactly, in edge variables, to regularizing only the \u03b4-functions associated to edges which do not contain the\nvertex of colour 1:\nZ\nt\nSint,1\n[\u03c6] = \u03bb [dg]9 \u03b4t (g4 g4\u2032-1 )\u03b4t (g5 g5\u2032-1 )\u03b4t (g6 g6\u2032-1 ) \u03c61 (g1 , g2 , g3 )\u03c62 (g3 , g5 , g4 )\u03c63 (g5\u2032 , g2 , g6 )\u03c64 (g4\u2032 , g6\u2032 , g1 ) + c.c.\n(29)\n\nWe see, then, that equation (26) interpolates between the four possible regularizations of this type.\nThe main fact that makes this form of the regularized amplitude (26) convenient for our purposes is that,\nusing the positivity of the heat-kernel, one can bound any of the four flatness constraints by \u03b4t (1l), and obtain\nbounds on amplitudes which have the same expression as with a regularization of the non-symmetric type\n(28), but maintaining the symmetry among colours manifest up to this last step.\nOne can then show that, for any graph G and any choice of colour l1 , the regularized amplitude AGt admits\nthe following bound:\n\uf8eb\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\uf8f6 \uf8eb\n\uf8f6\uf8f6\n\uf8eb\nZ\n\u2212\u2212\n\u2212\u2192\n\u2212\n\u2192\nY Y\nY\nY\nY\nf\nN\n3N\n|AGt | \u2264 (\u03bb\u03bb) 2 [dG] 2 \uf8ed\n\u03b4hv,bit \uf8ed\n(Gfv )\u01ebv \uf8f8\uf8f8 \uf8ed\n\u03b4 \uf8ed Gfv \uf8f8\uf8f8 ,\n(30)\nb\u2208Bl1 v\u2208Vb\n\nf \u2208\u25b3bv\n\nf \u2208Fl1\n\nv\u2208f\n\nwhere hv, bi denotes the number of triangles in a bubble b that contains the vertex v.\n\nLet us now repeat how this formula allows to derive interesting scaling bounds (see [13] for more details).\nThe general idea is that we would like to integrate out or otherwise remove the remaining propagator\nconstraints, which are in a sense non-local quantities (from the point of view of the bubbles) that prevent\nus from trivially integrating the amplitudes.\nA simple way of doing it is to pick up a second colour label l2 6= l1 , and bound all the flatness constraints\nassociated to vertices of colour l2 by their value at the identity.\nIn the resulting bound, all the propagator constraints will then have an independent variable of colour l2 ,\nallowing us to trivially integrate them.\n\n\f11\nWe are finally left with two \u03c63 graphs, corresponding to the strands in the two remaining colours l3 and\nl4 .\nNow, each connected component of such a graph is dual to a vertex (of the same colour) of the simplicial\ncomplex. Therefore, integrating a tree in each of these components, and bounding the final expression by\nits value at the identity, we arrive at:\n\uf8f6\uf8eb\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\nY\nY\nY\nN\n\u03b4hv,bit (1l)\uf8f8 \uf8ed\n|AGt | \u2264 (\u03bb\u03bb) 2 \uf8ed\n\u03b4|v|t (1l)\uf8f8 ,\n(31)\nv\u2208Vl3 \u222aVl4\n\nb\u2208Bl1 v\u2208Vb (l2 )\n\nwhere for any v \u2208 Vl3 \u222a Vl4\n\nX\n\n|v| \u2261\n\nhv, bi .\n\n(32)\n\nb\u2208Bl1 , b\u2283v\n\nis equal to the number of tetrahedra in the simplicial complex that contain v.

This gives:\nX\n\u03b3G \u2264 2 \u2212 2|Bl1 | +\n(|Vb (l2 )| + |Vb (l3 )| + |Vb (l4 )|)\n\n(38)\n\nb\u2208Bl1\n\n= 2 \u2212 2|Bl1 | +\n\nX\n\n|Vb | .\n\n(39)\n\nb\u2208Bl1\n\nWe then use the definition of the genus of a bubble b \u2208 Bl\n2 \u2212 2gb \u2261 |Vb | \u2212 |Eb | + |Fb | ,\n\n(40)\n\nand the combinatorial relation between the number of edges and faces\n2|E(b)| = 3|F (b)|\n\n(41)\n\nto write:\nX\n\nb\u2208Bl1\n\n|Vb | =\n\n\u0013\nX \u0012\nX\n|Fb |\nN\n2 \u2212 2gb +\n= 2|Bl1 | +\n\u22122\ngb .\n2\n2\n\nb\u2208Bl1\n\n(42)\n\nb\u2208Bl1\n\nTherefore:\n\u03b3G \u2264 2 +\n\nX\nN\n\u22122\ngb .\n2\n\n(43)\n\nb\u2208Bl1\n\nIn order to obtain a bound that is uniform in the number of interaction vertices (dual tetrahedra), one can\nsimply rescale the GFT coupling constant (this is the same rescaling used in the large-N expansion) as\n\u03bb\n\u03bb\u2192 p\n.\n\u03b4t (1l)\n\n(44)\n\nWe then summarize our result in the following proposition:\nProposition 1. Using the rescaling (44), the divergence degree \u03b3G of any connected vacuum graph G of the\ncoloured Boulatov model verifies, for any colour l:\nX\n\u03b3G \u2264 2 \u2212 2\ngb .\n(45)\nb\u2208Bl\n\nThese bounds have moreover been shown [13] to be optimal, in the following sense [13]: for any positive\nintegers (g1 , * * * , gn ), there exists\nPn a vacuum connected graph G such that its bubbles of colour l have genera\n(g1 , * * * , gn ), and \u03b3G = 2 \u2212 2 i=1 gi .\nFinally, as an immediate corollary of the previous proposition, on can give a bound in terms of the number\nof pointlike singularities of a given colour:\n\nCorollary 1. With the rescaling of the coupling constant (44), the divergence degree \u03b3G of any connected\nvacuum graph G verifies, for any colour l:\n\u03b3G \u2264 2(1 \u2212 Nls ) ,\n\n(46)\n\nwhere Nls is the number of singular vertices of colour l.\nTo summarize once more: in the perturbative expansion of the Boulatov GFT model, singular simplicial\ncomplexes are generically suppressed, uniformly in the number of tetrahedra, with respect to to the leading\norder, which is populated by regular manifolds only. In particular, they have all convergent amplitudes.\n\n\f13\n2.\n\nJacket bounds\n\nWe now focus on the jacket bounds, which are also crucial to the 1/N expansion. We show not only that\nthey can also be deduced from our framework, in a rather straightforward way, but also that the vertex\nreformulation of the model allows to derive a stronger bound than the known one.\nJackets are two dimensional closed and orientable surfaces embedded in a simplicial complex [44]. In the\nsimplicial complex dual to a 4-coloured graph G, we have three different jackets, each labelled by a pair (\u03c3, \u03c3 -1 )\nof cyclic permutations of the colour set [33, 34]. We can identify them as follows. We assign a colour (ll\u2032 )\nto any edge between two vertices of colours l and l\u2032 . Then, to each tetrahedron, one associates a rectangle,\nwhose edges are so constructed: for any colour l, the middle point of the edge of the tetrahedron of colour\n(\u03c3(l)\u03c3(l + 1)) is joined to the middle point of the edge of colour (\u03c3(l + 1)\u03c3(l + 2))1 . An example is given\nin Fig. 5. Gluings of tetrahedra induce gluings of these elementary rectangles, providing a quadrangulated\nsurface: this is a jacket. The construction just outlined also makes clear why there are three possible jackets\nthat can be embedded in the simplicial complex. Also, one can show that these three jackets correspond to\nthree possible reductions of the Boulatov model to a matrix model by reduction with respect to the diagonal\ngauge invariance (closure constraint) at the level of the action [44].\n\nFIG. 5: Elementary building block of the jacket associated to the cycle \u03c3 = (1 4 2 3) (double lines).\nBefore moving on to the computation of the bound, we need to express the genus of a jacket J = (\u03c3, \u03c3 -1 )\nin terms of combinatorial quantities of G. This is the purpose of the following lemma:\nLemma 1. The jacket of colour J = (\u03c3, \u03c3 -1 ) of a coloured graph G has genus:\n!\nX\n1\ngJ = 1 +\n|T | \u2212\n|E(\u03c3(l)\u03c3(l + 1))| ,\n2\n\n(47)\n\nl\n\nwith T and E(i) respectively the sets of tetrahedra and edges of colour i of the simplicial complex dual to G.\nProof. The jacket J is an orientable surface, hence its genus is related to its Euler characteristic by:\n2 \u2212 2gJ = \u03c7J = |FJ | \u2212 |EJ | + |VJ | ,\n\n1\n\nThe additions of colours are of course understood modulo 4.\n\n(48)\n\n\f14\nwhere FJ ,EJ and VJ are the sets of faces, edges and vertices of J. But, by construction:\nX\n|FJ | = |T | ,\n|EJ | = |t| ,\n|VJ | =\n|E(\u03c3(l)\u03c3(l + 1))| ,\n\n(49)\n\nl\n\nwhere t is the set of triangles in the simplicial complex. Since each triangle is shared by two tetrahedra, we\nalso have |t| = 2|T |, and the result follows.\nLet us now consider a connected vacuum graph G, and one of its jackets J = (\u03c3, \u03c3 -1 ). We can use the\nprevious lemma to write gJ data suited to bubble factorizations. Indeed, for any distinct colours l and l\u2032 ,\none immediately has:\nX\n|Vb (l\u2032 )| ,\n(50)\n|E(ll\u2032 )| =\nb\u2208Bl\n\nsince to any bubble b dual to the vertex vl , and vertex vl\u2032 \u2208 Vb (l\u2032 ), one uniquely associates the edge\n(vl vl\u2032 ) \u2208 E(ll\u2032 ). Therefore:\ngJ = 1 +\n\n1X X\nN\n\u2212\n|Vb (\u03c3(l + 1))| .\n2\n2\nl\n\n(51)\n\nb\u2208B\u03c3(l)\n\nWe can now try to make gJ appear in the bounds we computed so far. Applying (36) to (35), with\n(l, l\u2032 ) = (l3 , l3 ), we obtain:\nX\nX\n\u03b3G \u2264 1 +\n|Vb (l2 )| +\n|Vb (l4 )| .\n(52)\nb\u2208Bl1\n\nb\u2208Bl3\n\nAveraging this expression and\n\u03b3G \u2264 1 +\n\nX\n\n|Vb (l3 )| +\n\nb\u2208Bl2\n\nX\n\n|Vb (l1 )| ,\n\n(53)\n\nb\u2208Bl4\n\nwe obtain:\n\u03b3G \u2264 2 +\n\nN\n\u2212 gJ ,\n2\n\n(54)\n\nwith \u03c3 = (l1 l2 l3 l4 ). As for the bubble bound, a jacket bound that is uniform in the number of GFT\ninteraction vertices (tetrahedra of the simplicial complex) is obtained by a simple rescaling of the coupling\nconstant, and by the same power of the cut-off used in the case of bubble bound. We summarize our result\nin the following proposition:\nProposition 2. With the rescaling of the coupling constant (44), the convergence degree \u03b3G of any connected\nvacuum graph G verifies, for any of its jackets J:\n\u03b3G \u2264 2 \u2212 g J .\n\n(55)\n\n\u03b3G \u2264 2 \u2212 sup gJ .\n\n(56)\n\nIn particular, the following bound holds:\n\nJ\n\nWe note that, as anticipated, this bound is stronger than the usual jacket bound, proven in [11]:\n\u03b3G \u2264 2 \u2212\n\n1X\ngJ .\n3\nJ\n\n(57)\n\n\f15\n\nWe know already that, if a 3d complex has a jacket with genus zero, the complex is of spherical topology\n(trivial fundamental group) [3]. And we know that the above jacket bound is useful to unravel the topological\nproperties of the various terms appearing in the expansion in powers of the cut-off.\nWe conclude by noting also that the same bound could give further insights into the topology of the\ndominant terms of the same expansion, due to the following fact.\nJust as we know that g = inf G,J gJ is a topological invariant, called regular genus, similarly, g\u0303 =\ninf G supJ\u2208G gJ is also well defined, and a topological invariant by definition (the inf is taken over the equivalence class of graphs representing a given topology). If g\u0303 and g are not identical, then our results allow to\nderive a non-trivial topological bound in terms of g\u0303.\nIII.\n\n4D CASE: THE OOGURI MODEL\n\nIn this section, we extend the previous results to four dimensions, namely to the (coloured) Ooguri model.\nLike the Boulatov model, it is a GFT quantization of topological BF theory, and its Feynman amplitudes\ncan be written either as the simplicial path integral of such theory or as its state sum quantization. Because\n4d gravity models are constructed by constraining the data appearing in such model, either at the level of\nthe GFT action or directly at the level of its Feynman amplitudes, we see the results presented in this section\nas a first step towards performing a similar analysis in 4d gravity models.\nWe will first show that the coloured Ooguri GFT model, usually formulated in terms of group-theoretic\ndata associated to triangles in 4-dimensional simplicial complexes [20], can be equivalently written with data\nassociated to edges in the same simplicial complexes.\nSimilarly to the Boulatov model, such a formulation will allow to factorize the amplitudes in terms of bubbles (here the 4-bubbles), and to use new computation tools to derive bounds on the regularized amplitudes.\nThe two main results of this construction will be again: a) a bound on topologically singular vertices,\nresulting in a clear separation between leading order graphs corresponding to regular manifolds and subdominant graphs associated to non-manifold configurations; b) a new proof and an improvement of the\nso-called jacket bound [11], which moreover does not rely on topological moves (dipole contractions).\nA.\n1.\n\nEdge representation\n\nAction and partition function\n\nThe coloured Ooguri model is a field theory of five complex scalar fields {\u03c6l , l = 1, . . . , 5}, each of them\ndefined over four copies of SO(4), which respect the following gauge invariance condition:\n\u2200h \u2208 SO(4),\n\n\u03c6l (hg1 , hg2 , hg3 , hg4 ) = \u03c6l (g1 , g2 , g3 , g4 ).\n\n(58)\n\nLike in three dimensions, they are interpreted as quantized building blocks of spatial geometry, here tetrahedra. The SO(4) variables are interpreted as parallel transports of an SO(4) connection from the centre\nof the tetrahedra to the centres of their boundary triangles. The action encodes the gluing of five tetrahedra to form a four-simplex via the interaction term, while the kinetic parts mimic the identification of two\ntetrahedra along their boundary triangles:\nS[\u03c6] = Skin [\u03c6] + Sint [\u03c6],\n(59)\nZ\n5\nX\n1\nSkin [\u03c6] =\n(60)\n[dgi ]4\n\u03c6l (g1 , g2 , g3 , g4 )\u03c6l (g1 , g2 , g3 , g4 ),\n2\nl=1\nZ\nSint [\u03c6] = \u03bb [dgi ]10 \u03c61 (g1 , g2 , g3 , g4 )\u03c62 (g4 , g5 , g6 , g7 )\u03c63 (g7 , g3 , g8 , g9 )\u03c64 (g9 , g6 , g2 , g10 )\u03c65 (g10 , g8 , g5 , g1 )\n+ c.c.\n\n(61)\n\n\f16\n\nFIG. 6: Combinatorics of the kinetic (left) and interaction (right) kernels in the usual (triangle)\nformulation.\n\nA graphical representation of the two terms of this action is given in Fig. 6.\nThere is also a metric representation [23] of the same model in terms of Lie algebra variables, obtained\nvia a group Fourier transform, this time for the group SO(4) \u2243 (SU(2) \u00d7 SU(2))/Z2 . As in the 3d case, we\nwill however restrict ourselves to SO(3) \u00d7 SO(3), for which a simple invertible group Fourier transform is\navailable, and the generalised framework [22] is not needed. As before, functions on SO(3) will be identified\nwith functions f on SU(2) such that f (g) = f (\u2212g). We adopt the notation g = (g + , g \u2212 ) \u2208 SU(2) \u00d7 SU(2),\nand similarly for Lie algebra elements, and introduce the plane-waves\nEg : (su(2) \u00d7 su(2)) \u220b x 7\u2192 eg+ (x+ ) eg\u2212 (x\u2212 ) .\n\n\u2200g \u2208 SU(2) \u00d7 SU(2) ,\n\n(62)\n\nThe group Fourier transform is given by\nfb(x) \u2261\n\nZ\n\ndgf (g)Eg (x) ,\n\n(63)\n\nand sends the convolution product on L2 (SO(3) \u00d7 SO(3)) to a \u22c6-product, defined on plane-waves as:\n\u2200g1 , g2 \u2208 SU(2) \u00d7 SU(2) ,\n\nEg1 \u22c6 Eg2 \u2261 Eg1 g2 .\n\n(64)\n\nBesides these definitions, we will explicitly use the fact that the \u03b4-distributions on SO(3) \u00d7 SO(3) can be\ndecomposed in plane-waves as:\nZ\n\u03b4(g) = dxEg (x) .\n(65)\nDually, a non-commutative \u03b4-distribution on so(3) \u00d7 so(3) can be defined by:\nZ\n\u03b4\u22c6 (x) = dhEh (x) ,\n\n(66)\n\nwhich verifies, for any algebra function f :\n(\u03b4\u22c6 \u22c6 f ) (x) = f (0)\u03b4\u22c6 (0) .\n\n(67)\n\nIn analogy with what has been done in three dimensions, we would like to use the gauge invariance\ncondition to re-express the action in terms of fields whose arguments are associated to simplices of one\ndimension less: in this case, from triangles to edges.\nThe main difference with the 3d situation however, is that the numbers of edges and triangles in a\ntetrahedron do not match: a tetrahedron consists in four triangles, but six edges.\n\n\f17\nAt the level of a field \u03c6l (g1 , g2 , g3 , g4 ), whose variables are associated to 4 different triangles, this translates\ninto the fact that one can construct six independent edge variables Gij from pairs of triangle variables gi .\nFor example:\nG41 = g4-1 g1 ,\nG12 = g1-1 g2 ,\n\nG42 = g4-1 g2 ,\nG23 = g2-1 g3 ,\n\nG43 = g4-1 g3 ,\nG31 = g3-1 g1 .\n\n(68)\n\nThis means that, in order to match the number of degrees of freedom in the two representations, we will have\nto use more constraints than in the Boulatov model. These constraints will reflect geometrical conditions on\nthe holonomies in a tetrahedron. Remarking that the variable Gij represents the holonomy from the centre\nof the triangle i to the centre of the triangle j, we see that for any distinct indices i, j and k, we have:\nGij Gjk Gkl = 1l ,\n\n(69)\n\nwhere from now on we use the notation: Gij \u2261 G-1\nji . There are a priori four such equations to impose (one for\nany triplet {i, j, k}, i.e. one for any vertex of the tetrahedron). However, only three of them are independent,\nsince for example:\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2 G12 G24 G41 = 1l\nG23 G34 G42 = 1l =\u21d2 G12 G23 G31 = 1l\n(70)\n\uf8f3 G G G = 1l\n31 14 43\nThis suggests to introduce new fields \u03c8l : SO(4)\u00d76 \u2192 C, implicitly defined by1 :\n\n\u03c6l (g1 , g2 , g3 , g4 ) = \u03c6l (G41 , G42 , G43 , 1l)\nZ\n\u2261\ndG12 dG23 dG31 \u03b4(G12 G24 G41 )\u03b4(G23 G34 G42 )\u03b4(G31 G14 G43 )\n\n(71)\n\n\u00d7 \u03c8l (G41 , G42 , G43 , G12 , G23 , G31 ) .\n\nThis idea can be made precise using the group Fourier transform previously introduced. For any function\n\u03c6 \u2208 L2 ((SO(3) \u00d7 SO(3))\u00d74 ), we define a function \u03a5[\u03c6] of six so(3) \u00d7 so(3) elements:\nZ\n\u03a5[\u03c6](x41 , x42 , x43 , x12 , x23 , x31 ) \u2261 [dgi ]\u03c6(g1 , g2 , g3 , g4 )\nEg4 -1 g1 (x41 )Eg4 -1 g2 (x42 )Eg4 -1 g3 (x43 )\n\n\u00d7 Eg1 -1 g2 (x12 )Eg2 -1 g3 (x23 )Eg3 -1 g1 (x31 ) . (72)\n\nAs in the 3d case, such a function is invariant under a simultaneous (deformed) translation of all its arguments; in this case, however, no geometric interpretation of the variables appearing as field arguments\nnor of such invariance can be given, due to the fact that we are not dealing with geometric tetrahedra, but\nsimply with combinatorial simplices to which variables from the classical phase space of discrete BF theory\nare associated. The variables do not describe a geometric tetrahedron, and the translation symmetry of each\nfield has nothing to do with the translation of the vertices (or the edges) of the tetrahedra in some embedding\ninto R4 ; in fact, it is generated by a Lie algebra element of so(4) and not by a vector in R4 . We note also that\nthe origin of this symmetry of the GFT field itself, in both this new edge formulation and in the standard\ntriangle formulation, was already pointed out in [26] and lies in the fact that the translation/diffeomorphism\nsymmetry of BF theory in 4d (respectively, 3d) (which motivates also our edge (vertex) formulation) is\nreducible: not all edge (vertex) translations are independent and there is a trivial global symmetry of the\ntheory under simultaneous translation of all the edges (vertices) of the simplicial complex. In the 4d case,\nthere is an additional reducible component of the edge translation symmetry, also pointed out in [26], which\n\n1\n\nFrom now on, we will denote by \u03b4 the \u03b4-distribution on SO(3) \u00d7 SO(3), and by \u03b4SO(3) (resp. \u03b4SU(2) ) its counterpart on SO(3)\n(resp. SU(2)).\n\n\f18\nis the one we find at work here: the simultaneous translation of all the (variables associated to the) edges of\na tetrahedron that share a vertex by a Lie algebra element associated to this vertex.\nAnd as in the 3d case, a proper description of the invariance of the field under such deformed translations\n(in the Lie algebra) requires that we interpret the products of plane-waves as tensor products, taken in the\norder in which we wrote them1 .\nWith this convention in mind, \u03a5[\u03c6] is invariant under the following symmetries (only three of them being\nindependent):\n\u03a5[\u03c6] 7\u2192 T\u03b5142 \u22b2 \u03a5[\u03c6](xij ) = \u22c6\u03b5 \u03a5[\u03c6](x41 \u2212 \u03b5, x42 + \u03b5, x43 , x12 \u2212 \u03b5, x23 , x31 ) ,\n\u03a5[\u03c6] 7\u2192\n\u03a5[\u03c6] 7\u2192\n\u03a5[\u03c6] 7\u2192\n\nT\u03b5243\nT\u03b5143\nT\u03b5123\n\n(73)\n\n\u22b2 \u03a5[\u03c6](xij ) = \u22c6\u03b5 \u03a5[\u03c6](x41 , x42 \u2212 \u03b5, x43 + \u03b5, x12 , x23 \u2212 \u03b5, x31 ) ,\n\n(74)\n\n\u22b2 \u03a5[\u03c6](xij ) = \u22c6\u03b5 \u03a5[\u03c6](x41 \u2212 \u03b5, x42 , x43 + \u03b5, x12 , x23 , x31 + \u03b5) ,\n\n(75)\n\n\u22b2 \u03a5[\u03c6](xij ) = \u22c6\u03b5 \u03a5[\u03c6](x41 , x42 , x43 , x12 + \u03b5, x23 + \u03b5, x31 + \u03b5) .\n\n(76)\n\nThese transformations correspond to a simultaneous translation of the Lie algebra variables associated to\nthree edges sharing a vertex in a quantum tetrahedron by the same Lie algebra variables associated to such\ncommon vertex. For instance, T 142 translates the three edges sharing the vertex of colour 3.\nLet us call this space of such invariant fields T \u2261 Im(\u03a5), and D = Inv((SO(3) \u00d7 SO(3))\u00d74 ) the space of\nfields in L2 ((SO(3) \u00d7 SO(3))\u00d74 ) that satisfy the gauge invariance (58). We now prove that the map from\nusual variables to the Lie algebra edge variables is one-to-one.\nProposition 3. \u03a5 is a bijection between D and T.

Let us call \u03a5\ne\nWe first choose \u03c6 \u2208 D, and check that \u03a5 \u25e6 \u03a5[\u03c6] = \u03c6.

In this formula, \u03bd(Gl ) is the\nmeasure factor associated to the field l (i.e. a product of three \u03b4-functions as in the kinetic term), and\nHijk is defined by: Hijk \u2261 Gijk Gkij Gjki . These H's are holonomies around edges in the boundaries of the\n4-simplex corresponding to the GFT interaction vertex, in the very same way as the 3d case was giving\nflatness conditions around vertices in boundaries of tetrahedra. As remarked earlier, there are ten edges in\na 4-simplex, hence ten flatness conditions to impose (one for each choice of triplet of distinct colours i, j\nand k). However, only six of them are independent, which is why the same number of \u03b4-functions of this\ntype appear in the interaction. For the same reason, one is free to choose any set of six independent Hijk to\nwrite the distribution encoding flatness. As in 3d, this freedom will prove very useful.\n\n1\n\nNotice that this definition of the transformation from triangle to edge variables relies on the gauge invariance of the GFT\nfield and on its imposition as a projection operator (thus involving group averaging of the field over the action of the diagonal\nSO(4)); the above proof makes use of this invariance and of the compactness of the group itself. As such it would not go\nthrough unmodified in the Lorentzian case, where the relevant group, SO(3, 1) would be non-compact. This would in fact\nintroduce additional divergences that would need to be regulated. However, the generalization of our reformulation of the\ntheory to the Lorentzian setting seems clearly feasible on geometric/combinatorial grounds, and we expect it to require only\nadditional care in being defined properly.\n\n\f20\n\nFIG. 7: Combinatorics of the interaction in edge variables, in a form suitable for factorization of bubbles of\ncolour 5.\nThe partition function is defined through a path integral, with the propagator encoded in the covariance\nof a Gaussian measure \u03bcP :\nZ\n\nd\u03bcP (\u03c8, \u03c8) \u03c8l (g1 , * * * , g6 )\u03c8l\u2032 (g1\u2032 , * * * , g6\u2032 ) \u2261 \u03bd(g1 , * * * , g6 ) \u03b4l,l\u2032\n\n6\nY\n\n\u03b4(gi gi\u2032-1 )\n\ni=1\n\n= \u03b4(g4 g2-1 g1 )\u03b4(g5 g3-1 g2 )\u03b4(g6 g1-1 g3 ) \u03b4l,l\u2032\n\n6\nY\n\n\u03b4(gi gi\u2032-1 ) ;\n\n(88)\n\ni=1\n\nwith respect to which we integrate the exponential of the interaction part of the action1 :\nZ\nZ \u2261\nd\u03bcP (\u03c8, \u03c8) e\u2212V [\u03c8,\u03c8]\nZ\nV [\u03c8, \u03c8] \u2261 \u03bb [dG] V({H}) \u03c81 \u03c82 \u03c83 \u03c84 \u03c85 + c.c.\n\n(89)\n(90)\n\nWe kept variables of integration implicit in V , and called V the distribution encoding flatness in (87). The\nkernel V is represented as a stranded graph in Fig. 72 .\n2.\n\nAmplitudes\n\nIn this section, we explore a similar route as in the 3d case, and propose a way to write amplitudes in\nsuch a way that the integrand factorizes into bubble contributions. At this stage, everything is formal (the\namplitudes are generically divergent in absence of some regularization), but will be a precious guide in order\nto derive bounds once a cut-off is added.\nWe first pick up a given colour (say l = 5) and choose the six edges of the tetrahedron labelled by 5 to\nimpose the flatness conditions in any given 4-simplex. This corresponds to working with holonomies Hijk\nsuch that one of the indices is equal to 5. We can for example express the distribution V in (87) as:\nV = \u03b4(H345 ) \u03b4(H514 ) \u03b4(H125 ) \u03b4(H315 ) \u03b4(H245 ) \u03b4(H253 ) .\n\n1\n2\n\n(91)\n\nNote however that the interaction part does not include the constraints \u03bd, since they are already imposed in the propagator.\nIn order to limit the number of crossings, we have reorganized the strands of the different fields.\n\n\f21\nThis expression involves 18 independent variables Glij , 6 of them with l = 5, and 3 for each l 6= 5. Therefore,\nwhen computing the amplitude of a coloured graph G, all the propagators with l 6= 5 will have three strands\nwith free endpoints, that can be integrated straightforwardly. As a result, the closure conditions associated\nto tetrahedra of colour 5 will have trivial contributions. Let us verify it for a tetrahedron of colour 1. The\nintegral that we have to compute in this case is of the form:\nZ\nG\nA = [dG]\u03b4(G154 G142 G125 )\u03b4(G143 G132 G124 )\u03b4(G135 G152 G123 )R({G}) ,\n(92)\nwhere R does not depend on G142 , G123 and G134 , since H423 does not explicitly appears in the expression we\nchose for V. Successively integrating these variables we have:\nZ\nAG =\n[dG]\u03b4(G143 G132 G125 G154 )\u03b4(G135 G152 G123 )R({G})\nZ\n=\n[dG]\u03b4(G143 G135 G152 G125 G154 )R({G})\nZ\n=\n[dG]R({G}) ,\n(93)\nwhich shows that the amplitude is unchanged if all the propagators of colour 1 are replaced by trivial ones.\nTherefore, as in the 3d case, we are lead to simplified expressions for the amplitudes, where all propagators of\ncolour l 6= 5 are trivially integrated. This allows to factorize the integrand of the amplitude into bubbles (of\ncolour 5) contributions. Since within these bubbles all the propagators are effectively trivial, we can contract\neach connected component of strands in a bubble to one node. This is easily understood by looking at Fig.\n7: in each bubble, all the internal strands are part of lines of colours l 6= 5, that is those that effectively\ncontain only three strands; since the constraints associated to these propagators have been integrated with\nrespect to the deleted strands, the remaining strands encode simple convolutions of \u03b4-functions that can be\nsuccessively performed. The last \u03b4-distribution in a connected component of strands encodes flatness of its\ndual edge. We call B5 the set of bubbles of colour 5, Eb the set of edges in a bubble b, T5 the set of tetrahedra\nof colour 5. With these notations, the amplitude of G (with N nodes) can be written as:\n!\n!\nZ\n\u2192\nY Y \u2212\nY\nY\n\u03c4\nN\nG\n3N\n\u01eb\n\u03c4\n\u03c4\n\u03c4\n\u03c4\n\u03c4\n\u03c4\n\u03c4\n\u03c4\n\u03c4\n\u03c4\nA = (\u03bb\u03bb) 2 [dG]\n\u03b4( (Ge ) e )\n\u03b4(G43 G31 G14 )\u03b4(G32 G21 G13 )\u03b4(G24 G41 G12 ) (94)\n,\nb\u2208B5 e\u2208Eb\n\n\u03c4 \u2283e\n\n\u03c4 \u2208T5\n\nwhere \u01eb\u03c4e = \u00b11 depending on orientation conventions.\nThe different types of bounds we will prove in the next section will rely on two different ways of trivializing\nthe interaction kernels, so that the integration of the last propagators coupling the variables appearing in\ndifferent bubbles in the above expression can be performed. The two strategies give an expression for the\namplitudes in which different combinatorial substructures in the 5-coloured graph (and in its dual simplicial\ncomplex) are singled out, and will be used to obtain a bound referring to the 4-bubbles in one choice, and a\nbound referring to jackets in the other.\nIn a first strategy, we will trivialize three constraints associated to a tree of edges in each tetrahedron,\nwhich will allow to integrate all the remaining propagators. This will lead straightforwardly to a bubble\nbound. In a second strategy, we will trivialize the constraints associated to the three edges of a same\ntriangle in each tetrahedron. Only two \u03b4-functions per propagator will be easily integrable in this case, and\nthe remaining ones will allow to factorize the integrand in terms of Boulatov integrands, henceforth giving\na bound involving Boulatov amplitudes of 4-bubbles. This will instead lead to a jacket bound.\nB.\n\nRegularization and general scaling bounds\n\nThe amplitudes as written are of course divergent and need to be regularized to be given rigorous meaning.\nA nice aspect of the latter formulation of the Ooguri model lies in the fact that the constraints associated to\nedges need not to be regularized in order to make the amplitudes finite, as it will be shortly proven. In other\n\n\f22\nwords, only the dynamics of the theory is affected by the cut-off procedure, and not the kinematical space of\nfields in terms of which the theory is defined. As in the 3d case, we will use a heat-kernel regularization of\nthe \u03b4-distributions, that with respect to a sharp cut-off will have the main advantage of being positive. The\nSO(3)\u00d7 SO(3) \u03b4-distribution splits into a product of two SO(3) terms: for any g = (g + , g \u2212 ) \u2208 SO(3)\u00d7 SO(3),\n\u03b4(g) = \u03b4 SO(3) (g + )\u03b4 SO(3) (g \u2212 ). Given our parametrization of the space of functions on SO(3) \u00d7 SO(3), we can\ndefine a regularized distribution for SO(3) \u00d7 SO(3) using SU(2) heat-kernels:\n\u2200g = (g + , g \u2212 ) \u2208 SO(3) \u00d7 SO(3),\n\nSU(2)\n\n\u03b4t (g) \u2261 \u03b4t\n\nSU(2)\n\n(g + )\u03b4t\n\n(g \u2212 ) .\n\nWe therefore define the regulated partition function as:\nZ\nZt \u2261\nd\u03bcP (\u03c8, \u03c8) e\u2212Vt [\u03c8,\u03c8] .\n\n(95)\n\n(96)\n\nVt is the regulated interaction, associated to the kernel:\nVt \u2261\n\nY\nY\n1\n1\nj\ni\nk\n\u03b4\n(G\nG\nG\n)\n=\n\u03b4t (Hijk )\nt\njk\nij\nki\n[\u03b4t (1l)]4\n[\u03b4t (1l)]4\n{ijk}\n\n(97)\n\n{ijk}\n\nwhere the product runs over the 10 possible choices of 3 colours among 5. Note that we chose a symmetric\nregularization in the colours, hence the rescaling by [\u03b4 (11l)]4 .\nt\nThe same kind of comments as in 3d apply here. First, this choice of symmetric regularization is convenient\nas it will allow to easily average over colour attributions. Second, we could have as well chosen a nonsymmetric regularization, compatible with the map \u03a5. For example, a regularized interaction\nZ\nt\nSint,5 [\u03c6] = \u03bb [dgi ]10 \u03b4t (g2 g2\u2032-1 )\u03b4t (g3 g3\u2032-1 )\u03b4t (g4 g4\u2032-1 )\u03b4t (g6 g6\u2032-1 )\u03b4t (g7 g7\u2032-1 )\u03b4t (g9 g9\u2032-1 )\n\u00d7 \u03c61 (g1 , g2\u2032 , g3\u2032 , g4\u2032 )\u03c62 (g4 , g5 , g6\u2032 , g7\u2032 )\u03c63 (g7 , g3 , g8 , g9\u2032 )\u03c64 (g9 , g6 , g2 , g10 )\u03c65 (g10 , g8 , g5 , g1 ) + c.c\n(98)\n\nin triangle variables corresponds to a regularized interaction kernel\nY\n\u03b4t (Hijk )\nVt5 \u2261\n\n(99)\n\n{ij5}\n\nin edge variables, which in turn implies an explicit factorization of the amplitudes in terms of bubbles of\ncolour 5. This is the exact analogue of (94) in the theory with cut-off.\nWith the symmetric regularization, this type of factorization is recovered as a bound only, but for arbitrary\ncolour l. Moreover this bound will be always saturated in power counting. It is obtained by bounding four\nredundant flatness conditions in all the interactions. For instance, if we use the colour 5 as before, we have:\nY\n\u03b4t (Hij5 ) ,\n(100)\n|Vt | \u2264\n{ij5}\n\nwhere now the product runs over the 6 flatness conditions involving the colour 5.

There are two kinds of such trees: three edges sharing a same vertex; or three edges such that\nthe first one shares a vertex with the second, the second with the third, but the third does not share any\nvertex with the first one (see Fig. 8a and 8b). Of course we want to use the colours to define these trees, so\nthat the same simplification takes place in all the tetrahedra in the simplicial complex. The notations are\nas follows: we will associate the colour {l1 l2 l3 } to an edge involving flatness constraints Hl1 l2 l3 . Such an\nedge is therefore dual to a (maximal) connected subgraph of G, involving only lines of colours l1 , l2 and l3 .1\nFor definiteness, we will use variables involved in flatness conditions around edges of colours {345}, {145}\nand {135}, a choice that corresponds to a tree of the first kind (i.e. Fig 8a).\nSince each strand is connected to two interactions, the integrals to compute are not simple convolutions,\ntherefore difficult. To circumvent this problem we simply bound all the heat-kernels implementing flatness constraints of colours {345}, {145} and {135} by their value at the identity, and then integrate the\npropagators.

As in 3d, we therefore need to introduce a combinatorial quantity\nthat determines whether a bubble is spherical or not. Unlike in 3d however, this cannot be the genus, since\nthe Euler characteristic of a manifold in odd dimensions\nP is 0, irrespectively of its topology. We therefore\npropose to use the notion of degree [11] instead: \u03c9 = J gJ , where the sum runs over the jackets of the\n4-coloured graph dual to the triangulation of the boundary of the 4d bubble around vertices of the simplicial\ncomplex, and gJ is the genus of the jacket. Indeed, the degree is 0 only for a specific set of simplicial\ndecompositions of the sphere (those associated to melonic graphs [36]). As a result, in this 4d case we will\nprove a bound on simplicial complexes which have non-melonic bubbles, that is on a subclass of manifolds\nas well as on singular pseudomanifolds. But, remarking that all the jackets of a non-spherical bubble have\ngenus bigger than 1, we will refine the bound for singular pseudomanifolds, which will in the end take the\nsame form as in 3d.\nLet us consider a connected and closed coloured graph G. We propose to use the bound (107) to deduce\na bound on the divergent degree \u03b3G of G. Since the prefactor K can be chosen to be 1, only the parameter\n\u03b3 in (107) matters, and \u03b3G \u2264 \u03b3, that is:\nX\n(|Eb (345)| + |Eb (145)| + |Eb (135)|) .\n(113)\n\u03b3G \u2264 |E(125)| + |E(235)| + |E(245)| +\nb\u2208B5\n\n\f26\nSince this expression involves only quantities associated to edges and 4-bubbles of the simplicial complex, let\nus show that the sum of the degrees of the same bubbles can also be expressed in terms of similar quantities,\nnamely we first prove:\nLemma 2.\nX\n\n\u03c9(b) = 3|B5 | +\n\nb\u2208B5\n\nX\n3N\n|Eb |\n\u2212\n2\n\nProof. Indeed, by definition of the degree of a bubble b \u2208 B5 , and by formula (47), we have:\n!!\n4\nX\nX\n1\n5\n|Tb | \u2212\n|Eb (\u03c3(l)\u03c3(l + 1))|\n,\n\u03c9(b) =\n1+\n2\n\u22121\nJ=(\u03c3,\u03c3\n\n(114)\n\nb\u2208B5\n\n(115)\n\nl=1\n\n)\n\nwhere \u03c3 are cycles over {1, . . . , 4}.1 There are three different jackets in b, and each of them has support over\nfour edge colours out of six, therefore:\n\u0012\n\u0013\n3\u00d74\n1\n5\n3|Tb | \u2212\n|Eb |\n\u03c9(b) = 3 +\n2\n6\n3|Tb5 |\n\u2212 |Eb | .\n(116)\n= 3+\n2\nSumming over the bubbles, and using\nX\n\n|Tb5 | = 2|T 5 | = N\n\n(117)\n\nb\u2208B5\n\nwe finally obtain the claimed equality.\nP\nWe therefore just need to make b\u2208B5 |Eb | appear on the right-hand-side of inequality (113) To this aim,\nand as in the 3d case, we prove a combinatorial lemma:\nLemma 3. For any distinct edge colour i:\n|B5 | + |E(i)| \u2212\n\nX\n\n|Eb (i)| \u2264 1 .\n\n(118)\n\nb\u2208B5\n\nProof. Consider the graph Ci,5 (G) whose nodes are the elements of B5 \u222a E(i), and links are constructed as\nfollows: there is a link between a bubble b \u2208 B5 and e \u2208 E(i) if and only if e appears in the triangulation\nof b. We first show that, because G itself is assumed to be connected, Ci,5 (G) is also connected. Let bi and\nbf be two elements of Ci,5 (G) \u2229 B5 . The connectivity of G ensures that there exists a sequence of p bubbles\n(bi \u2261 b0 , b1 , * * * , bp\u22121 , bp \u2261 bf ), such that: for any k \u2208 J0, pK, bk and bk+1 share a tetrahedron \u03c4k . Hence: for\nany k \u2208 J0, pK, bk and bk+1 share an edge ek . So, in Ci,5 (G), (bi \u2261 b0 , e0 , b1 , e1 , * * * , bp\u22121 , ep\u22121 , bp \u2261 bf ) is a\nconnected path from bi to bf . Finally, remarking that any element of Ci,5 (G) \u2229 E(i) is by definition connected\nto at least one element of Ci,5 (G) \u2229 B5 , we conclude that any two nodes of Ci,5 (G) are connected. Call L the\nnumber of links of Ci,5 (G). Its number of nodes being equal to |B5 | + |E(i)|, the connectivity implies that:\n|B5 | + |E(i)| \u2264 1 + L .\n\n(119)\n\nBut for any b \u2208 B5 , the number of lines L(b) connected to b in Ci,5 (G) verifies: L(b) \u2264 |Eb (i)|. This is\nbecause Eb (i) is the set of available edges of colour i in the bubble (some of which might be identified when\n\n1\n\nNote that we also used the fact that labelling jackets by cycles over vertex colours as in (47), is equivalent to labelling them\nby cycles over edge colours.\n\n\f27\ngluing the different bubbles together), and L(b) is the true number of edges of colour i in b, once all the\nidentifications of edges have been taken into account. Since by construction\nX\nL(b) ,\n(120)\nL=\nb\u2208B5\n\nwe conclude that:\n|B5 | + |E(i)| \u2264 1 +\n\nX\n\nL(b) \u2264 1 +\n\nX\n\n|Eb (i)| .\n\n(121)\n\nb\u2208B5\n\nb\u2208B5\n\nThis, together with (113) and (114), immediately yields the wanted result:\n\u03b3G \u2264 3 +\n\nX\n3N\n\u03c9(b) .\n\u2212\n2\n\n(122)\n\nb\u2208B5\n\nOf course, we have a similar bound for any colour l.\nThis formula is particularly simple when the coupling constant \u03bb is appropriately rescaled:\n\u03bb\u2192\n\n\u03bb\n,\n\u03b4t (1l)3/2\n\n(123)\n\nwhich is also the setting of the 1/N expansion [11]. Thus we have obtained the following:\nProposition 4. With the rescaling of the coupling constant (123), the divergence degree \u03b3G of a graph G\nverifies, for any colour l:\nX\n\u03c9(b) .\n(124)\n\u03b3G \u2264 3 \u2212\nb\u2208Bl\n\nGiven that any pointlike singularity implies a degree greater than zero, we therefore see that, like in 3d, the\nmore pointlike singularities of the same colour a simplicial complex has, the more its amplitude is suppressed\nwith respect to the leading order (\u223c \u03b4t (1l)3 ). We can make this point a bit more precise, making use of a\nlemma, a simple proof of which can be found in the review [3]1 :\nLemma 4. If a connected 4-coloured graph G possesses a spherical jacket, then G is dual to a sphere.\nProof. See Proposition 3 in [3].\nIn particular, this implies that if a bubble b is not spherical, all its jackets have genus at least 1, and\ntherefore: \u03c9(b) \u2265 3. This allows to prove the following corollary:\nCorollary 2. With the rescaling of the coupling constant (123), the divergence degree \u03b3G of any connected\nvacuum graph G verifies, for any colour l:\n\u03b3G \u2264 3(1 \u2212 Nls ) ,\n\n(125)\n\nwhere Nls is the number of singular vertices of colour l.\nThis result is very similar to what we have proven in 3d, showing suppression of singular pseudomanifolds\nwith respect to the leading order (\u03b3G = 3), therefore consisting only of manifolds. In particular, in both\ncases singular pseudomanifolds all have convergent amplitudes.\nFinally, as anticipated in the beginning of this section, we notice that equation (124) also constrain the\namplitudes of a special class of manifolds: those which have non-melonic bubbles.\n\n1\n\nThis result is actually generalizable to any dimension, since a graph with a planar jacket has a trivial regular genus, a property\nthat in turn characterizes spheres (see [33, 34] and references therein).\n\n\f28\nCorollary 3. With the rescaling of the coupling constant (123), the divergence degree \u03b3G of any connected\nvacuum graph G verifies, for any colour l:\n\u03b3G \u2264 3 \u2212 Nlnm ,\n\n(126)\n\nwhere Nlnm is the number of non-melonic bubbles of colour l.\nD.\n\nJacket bound\n\nThe notion of jacket of a graph G we used in 3d generalizes to any dimension. They are closed surfaces\nlabelled by pairs (\u03c3, \u03c3 -1 ) of cyclic permutations of {1, . . . , 5}, in which the graph G can be regularly embedded\n[33, 34]1 . The jacket J = (\u03c3, \u03c3 -1 ) is the closed surface constituted of all the faces of colours (\u03c3(l)\u03c3(l + 1))\nin G, glued along there common links. Its genus can be easily computed in terms of combinatorial data\nassociated to G:\nLemma 5. The jacket J = (\u03c3, \u03c3 -1 ) of a 5-coloured graph G has genus:\n5\n\ngJ = 1 +\n\n3N\n1X\n\u2212\n|F (\u03c3(l)\u03c3(l + 1))| ,\n4\n2\n\n(127)\n\nl=1\n\nwhere N is the order of G, and F (ij) is the set of faces of colour (ij) (dual to the set of triangles of colour\n(ij) in the simplicial complex).\nProof. By definition, the Euler characteristic of J is:\n\u03c7J = 2 \u2212 2gJ = |FJ | \u2212 |EJ | + |VJ |\n\n(128)\n\nwhere FJ , EJ and VJ are the set of faces, edges and vertices of J. But, by construction:\nX\n|FJ | =\n|F (\u03c3(l)\u03c3(l + 1))| ,\n|EJ | = L ,\n|VJ | = N ,\n\n(129)\n\nl\n\nwhere L is the number of lines in G. Since moreover L = 2N , we conclude that:\n2 \u2212 2gJ = \u2212\n\n3N X\n+\n|F (\u03c3(l)\u03c3(l + 1))| .\n2\n\n(130)\n\nl\n\nJackets have been used in the Ooguri model to compute bounds on amplitudes [11]. Interestingly, our\nconstruction allows to slightly strengthen these results, which we demonstrate now. Discarding prefactors,\nformula (112) immediately implies the following bound on the degree of divergence of a graph G:\nX\nX\n\u03b33d (b) ,\n(131)\n(|Eb (235)| + |Eb (245)|) +\n\u03b3G \u2264 |E(125)| +\nb\u2208B5\n\nb\u2208B2\n\nwhere \u03b33d (b) is the degree of divergence of the 3d amplitudes represented by the bubble graph b. Since the\nchoice of colours is arbitrary this generalizes immediately. For any cycle \u03c3 = (l1 l2 l3 l4 l5 ) of (12345):\nX\nX\n\u03b3G \u2264 |E(l1 l3 l5 )| +\n(|Eb (l1 l2 l3 )| + |Eb (l1 l3 l4 )|) +\n\u03b33d (b) .\n(132)\nb\u2208Bl1\n\n1\n\nb\u2208Bl3\n\nIn contrast with the 3d case, we construct the jackets in terms of data related to the graph G itself, as opposed to its dual\nsimplicial complex. If the two descriptions are of course equivalent, we find more convenient to work with G itself in 4d, since\nrepresenting or even giving an intuitive picture of simplicial complexes is necessarily more difficult than in 3d.\n\n\f29\nWe would like to deduce from this an inequality involving the genus of the jacket J associated to the cycle\n\u03c3. This can be done in three steps. First remark that for any i 6= j, and l different from both i and j, the\nset of faces F (ij) can be partitioned in terms of the faces Fb (ij) of the bubble graphs b \u2208 Bl :\nF (ij) = \u222a Fb (ij) .\n\n(133)\n\nb\u2208Bl\n\nBut since the set of faces Fb (ij) is dual to the set of edges Eb (lij) in the simplicial complex associated to b,\nwe immediately obtain the following equality of cardinals:\nX\n|F (ij)| =\n|Eb (lij)| .\n(134)\nb\u2208Bl\n\nIn particular, the sum over Bl1 in (132) is equal to |F (l2 l3 )| + |F (l3 l4 )|. Second, we can use lemma 3 to\nbound |E(l1 l3 l5 )|:\nX\n|E(l1 l3 l5 )| \u2264 1 \u2212 |Bl3 | +\n(135)\n|Eb (l1 l3 l5 )| = 1 \u2212 |Bl3 | + |F (l1 l5 )| .\nb\u2208Bl3\n\nFinally, we can use a bound of the type (52) to bound the \u03b33d (b) terms:\nX\nX\n\u03b33d (b) \u2264\n(1 + |Eb (l3 l1 l2 )| + |Eb (l3 l4 l5 )|) = |Bl3 | + |F (l1 l2 )| + |F (l4 l5 )| .\nb\u2208Bl3\n\n(136)\n\nb\u2208Bl3\n\nAll in all we obtain:\n\u03b3G \u2264 1 +\n\n5\nX\n\n|F (\u03c3(l)\u03c3(l + 1))| = 3 +\n\nl=1\n\n3N\n\u2212 2gJ\n2\n\n(137)\n\nThis is our final result, which as in 3d is particularly nice once the coupling constant has been appropriately\nrescaled.\nProposition 5. With the rescaling of the coupling constant (123), the divergence degree \u03b3G of a connected\nvacuum graph G verifies, for any jacket gJ :\n\u03b3G \u2264 3 \u2212 2gJ .\n\n(138)\n\nIn particular, we notice that the best (strongest) bound is obtained considering the maximum of the genera\nof all the 12 jackets of the graph G. Also, we see that all graphs with a jacket of genus greater than 2 have\nconvergent amplitudes, just like singular pseudomanifolds.\nThis has to be compared with the known jacket bound, which is weaker and is a direct corollary of the\nprevious result:\nCorollary 4. With the rescaling of the coupling constant (123), the divergence degree \u03b3G of a connected\nvacuum graph G verifies:\n1\n\u03b3G \u2264 3 \u2212 \u03c9(G) .\n6\n\n(139)\n\nProof. The degree of G is defined by:\n\u03c9(G) =\n\nX\n\ngJ ,\n\n(140)\n\nJ\n\nso that averaging the previous bound over the 12 jackets of G immediately gives the standard jacket bound.\n\n\f30\nIV.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nWe have used a vertex reformulation of the Boulatov model in 3d and an edge reformulation of the Ooguri\nmodel in 4d to obtain new scaling bounds for their Feynman amplitudes. The standard formulations in\nterms of variables associated to edges (Boulatov) and triangles (Ooguri) have the advantage of bringing the\nsame amplitudes in a geometrically clear simplicial path integral form (in the Lie algebra representation)\nor of highlighting the topological nature of the model, weighting only flat discrete connections (in group\nrepresentation). The new formulations, on the other hand, seem more natural from a field theory point of\nview, in light of the fact that the symmetry group of the theory (diffeomorphism/translation symmetry)\nacts on such variables, and, as we have shown in this paper, allows a more direct and powerful analysis\nof the scaling of the amplitudes when the cut-off is removed. In particular, we have obtained, in both 3d\nand 4d topological models: a) a bound focused on the contribution of bubbles (3-cells or 4-cells, in 3d and\n4d respectively) around vertices of the simplicial complex dual to the GFT diagrams, where the presence\nof conical singularities distinguishes arbitrary pseudomanifolds from manifolds, showing that the singular\ncomplexes are generically suppressed in perturbation theory (that is, at any order or for any number of\nsimplices); b) a bound depending on the genera of the so-called jackets (embedded surfaces) of the same\ncomplex, stronger than the known ones that allowed to prove the dominance of spherical manifolds in\nthe limit of large values of the cut-off. In the process, we have obtained several further insights into the\ncombinatorial structure of the diagrams themselves and the properties of the amplitudes.\nLet us comment on a few interesting aspects of the results obtained, and of the procedure used to obtain\nthem. First, as we anticipated, the entire construction relies on the gauge invariance/closure condition\nimposed in the initial GFT field. Therefore it could be considered, at least until similar results are reproduced\nby other means, a characteristic feature of GFT models of the type we considered (and in more direct\nrelation with spin foam and simplicial gravity approaches), not easily extendable to the simpler tensor\nmodels. Second, at the same time the geometric interpretation and content of the data entering the GFT\namplitudes and states has not been really used in a crucial way in our analysis, which was essentially based\non combinatorial aspects, thus more in line with the usual analysis of tensor models. The full geometric\ncontent will become more relevant, we expect, when considering open GFT Feynman diagrams and nontrivial boundary states. From both a physical and mathematical point of view, we expect the type of\nboundary states used to affect sensibly the sum over complexes, that is the dynamics of the theory. Of\ncourse, this will be even more true in non-topological, 4d gravity models.\nOn top of settling the important issue of the relative weight of regular versus singular configurations in\nthe GFT sum over complexes, at least for this class of models, the results obtained in this work, and in\nparticular the improved jacket bounds, will be relevant first of all for future studies of renormalizability and\ncritical behaviour of the same models. This is indeed the next item on the agenda.\nWe expect them to be directly relevant also for closely related models. These include, for example, the\ndynamical version of topological models, that is their modification including group laplacian operators in\nthe kinetic term. The additional propagators would modify the power counting, but on the one hand they\njust bring additional decays with the cut-off, on the other hand they may also be an alternative way to\nobtain the rescaling of the coupling constant that we imposed in deriving uniform bounds. Thus we expect\nour scaling bounds and in general our analysis to be still relevant. Still, only a proper study can confirm\nthis expectation. More important, our result will be relevant for 4d gravity models. In fact, all current\nspin foam and GFT models for 4d gravity are constructed starting from the topological Ooguri model by\nadding suitable restrictions on the group, Lie algebra or representation data appearing in the GFT action\nand summed over in the Feynman amplitudes. As a result, they share many properties of topological models\nand we expect our analysis, if not our results, to be easily extended to them. As we had pointed out already,\nthe fact that our proofs did not rely on combinatorial/topological invariance properties (e.g. invariance of\nthe amplitudes under Pachner or dipole moves) should make the extension to gravity models less difficult.\nThe edge representation we develop for the topological 4d GFT model has a potential interest for the 4d\ngravity models from a purely geometric perspective as well. In fact, as mentioned above, such gravity models\nare constructed by constraining the variables associated to triangles of the simplicial complex and that are\ninterpreted as the discretization of the B-field in topological BF theory, an interpretation that is confirmed\n\n\f31\nexplicitly by the simplicial path integral form of the GFT amplitudes in the Lie algebra representation. The\nsought-for effect of the constraints on discrete B-variables is to enforce geometricity of the configurations\nsummed over in the resulting simplicial path integral, or, in other words, to allow the reconstruction from\nthe same discrete B-variables of a discrete tetrad field encoding the metric information of the simplicial\ncomplex. The resulting discrete tetrad would be associated indeed to the edges of the simplicial complex, as\nedge vectors. Therefore, we expect that the edge reformulation of the constrained topological GFT models,\nfollowing our construction, will lead more naturally to a re-formulation of them in which metric information\nwill be more transparent and easier to analyse. In the same 4d gravity models we may expect a further\ntransformation of variables to be available, which would express the GFT field and amplitudes in terms\nof variables associated to the vertices of the simplicial complex. Beside purely geometric considerations,\nthis expectation is motivated by the fact that the constraints reducing topological BF theory to gravity in\na simplicial setting also break the translation invariance of the theory (acting on edges of the complex),\nleaving as natural transformations (although not necessarily symmetries [42]) only vertex translations, as a\nsimplicial counterpart of diffeomorphism invariance of the continuum. We leave this for future work.\nAcknowledgements\n\nThis work is partially supported by a Sofja Kovalevskaja Award by the A. von Humboldt Stiftung, which\nis gratefully acknowledged.
