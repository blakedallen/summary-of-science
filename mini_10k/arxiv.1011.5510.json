The presence of a\nnegative probability density may appear to preclude its description in relativistic hydrodynamics. The origin of such\npathology arises because the wave equation is second order in the time-derivative, and the corresponding probability\ndensity involves a time-derivative of the wave function. Dirac's resolution of the problem led to the introduction of\nanother wave equation, the Dirac equation, that is first order in the time-derivative [1, 2]. A parallel resolution of\nthe pathology was provided by Pauli and Weisskopf in quantum field theory with the introduction of particles and\nantiparticles, and the wave field \u03c8 is interpreted not as the probability amplitude but as comprising of operators that\ncreate and destroy particles in various modes [3].\nWave mechanical interpretation of the wave field \u03c8 was however reintroduced by Feshbach and Villars [4] by noting\nthat the Klein-Gordon equation actually contains both particle and antiparticle degrees of freedom. The particleantiparticle separation can be achieved by writing the Klein-Gordon and the Dirac equations as a set of coupled timedependent Schr\u00f6dinger equations for the particle and antiparticle wave function components with positive probability\ndensities [4].\nIn many practical problems, as for example in the evolution of dense matter with relativistic constituents in\nrelativistic hydrodynamics [5\u201310] or in the quarkonium two-body problem [11, 12], particles and antiparticles can be\napproximately treated as two distinct types of interacting particles, and they possess positive probability densities.\nFor these problems, we are motivated to follow the Feshbach-Villars formalism where the particle and antiparticle\nprobability densities can be positive definite.\nWe wish however to modify the formulation of Feshbach and Villars [4]. In their formulation, the relativistic properties of the momentum variables in the coupled Schr\u00f6dinger equations are not readily apparent and the Schr\u00f6dinger\nequation for the antiparticle wave function contains the operator \u2212(p\u2212eA)2 /2m that differs from the standard kinetic\nenergy operator by a sign. It will be desirable to reformulate the problem so that the relativistic properties of the\nmomentum variables become more apparent and the Schr\u00f6dinger equations for the particle and antiparticle wave functions contain kinetic energy operators with the same sign. As a result, the connection to relativistic hydrodynamics\ncan be more readily worked out.\nUsing the new set of coupled Schr\u00f6dinger equations, we wish to search for a hydrodynamical description for the\nevolution of relativistic probability densities. Hydrodynamics and quantum mechanics have many elements in common,\nsince the density fields and the velocity fields are important dynamical variables in both descriptions. It is therefore\nwell-known that the Schr\u00f6dinger equation can be cast into a hydrodynamical form for the evolution of the probability\ndensity [13, 14]. Such a correspondence has been utilized [15] to form the foundation for an \"a posteriori\" theoretical\nsupport for the validity of treating a nucleus as a liquid drop, as in Bohr and Wheeler [16], and treating the fission\nof a nucleus in liquid-drop hydrodynamics, as in Hill and Wheeler [17]. There are however important differences\nassociated with quantum effects that are absent in classical hydrodynamics [14, 15, 18, 19]. The deviation of the\nclassical hydrodynamical description from the quantum treatment is embodied in the presence of the quantum stress\n\n\u2217\n\nwongc@ornl.gov\n\n\f2\n(q)\n\ntensor pij in quantum fluids [14, 15]. Quantum shell effects manifest themselves as nuclear shell effects superimposed\non a smooth hydrodynamical liquid-drop background and they lead to the intrinsic deformation in many nuclei [19].\nIn the related area of hadron and nuclear collisions, a relativistic hydrodynamical description of the collision process\nis a reasonable concept, as pioneered by the work of Landau [5] and supported by recent experimental findings [20\u201322].\nRelativistic hydrodynamics has been applied to study the evolution of a quark-gluon matter in the work of Bjorken\n[6], Baym et al. [7], Ollitraut [8], and many others [9]. They led to successful investigations on the dynamics of\nmatter with relativistic constituents in extreme conditions, as occurs in relativistic heavy-ion collisions [20, 23]. Wave\nmechanical description of quantum systems in terms of probability densities and probability currents contains the\nproper theoretical ingredients appropriate for continuum hydrodynamics. It will therefore be of interest to generalize\nprevious formulation of hydrodynamics in the Schr\u00f6dinger equation in Ref. [14] to Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations,\nin order to investigate how the wave mechanics of Klein-Gordon and Dirac particles may be used to provide the\nfoundation for relativistic hydrodynamics of dense and compressed systems with relativistic constituents.\nAs the foundation of hydrodynamics is usually presented within the framework of the kinetic theory [24\u201327], it is\ninstructive to investigate how the present quantum probability density approach and the kinetic theory approach are\nconnected. We shall study how the equation of motion for the Wigner function, derived from the time-dependent\nSchr\u00f6dinger equations representing the Klein-Gordon equation, can be related to the equation of motion for the phase\nspace distribution function in the kinetic theory, in the classical weak-field and collisionless limit.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Section II, we introduce the particle and antiparticle wave functions to\nrepresent the Klein-Gordon wave function and its time derivative. The Klein-Gordon equation is then separated into\ntwo coupled time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equations. The particle and antiparticle probability densities obey equations\nof continuity containing additional terms, but the total net particle number remains a conserved quantity. In Section\nIII, we examine the Euler equation for the motion of the probability fluid of a particle or an antiparticle. To provide\ninsight into the dynamics, we specialize to the simplified case when the particle-antiparticle pair production can be\nsuppressed. The motion of the probability fluids of particle and antiparticle obeys relativistic fluid dynamics equations,\nand the quantum stress tensor provides part of the source of the equation of state of relativistic matter. In Section\nIV, we examine the generalization to relativistic hydrodynamics for a simple many-body system in the mean-field\ndescription. In Section V, we derive the equation of motion for the Wigner function and compare it with the equation\nof motion for the distribution function in the kinetic theory. In Section VI, we present our summary and discussions.\nII.\n\nSEPARATION OF KLEIN-GORDON EQUATION INTO PARTICLE AND ANTIPARTICLE\nCOMPONENTS\n\nIn the present investigation, we are interested in the temporal evolution of a single-particle boson state \u03bd with an\ninitial wave function \u03c8(r, t) at t = 0, in external fields that consist of a scalar field S and a vector gauge field (A0 , A)\nwith a coupling constant e. The single-particle state is characterized by a (net) particle number n\u03bd that is a conserved\nquantity (see Eqs. (15) and (16) below). The particle number of a state is quantized; it has the value of n\u03bd = 1 when\n\u03bd is a particle state and n\u03bd = \u22121 when \u03bd is an antiparticle state. The evolution of the state \u03bd is described by the\nKlein-Gordon equation\n~\n(i~\u2202t \u2212 eA0 )2 \u03c8 = [( \u2207 \u2212 eA)2 + (m + S)2 ]\u03c8.\ni\n\n(1)\n\nTo separate out the particle and antiparticle degrees of freedom, we introduce the energy function E and the auxiliary\nwave function \u03c84 . For a given wave function \u03c8 for the state \u03bd with a charge e\u03bd = n\u03bd e, the energy function E is the\npositive root of the following quadratic equation of E,\nZ\n~\ndr \u03c8 \u2217 {(E \u2212 e\u03bd A0 )2 + [i~\u2202t (E \u2212 e\u03bd A0 )] \u2212 [( \u2207 \u2212 e\u03bd A)2 + (m + S)2 ]}\u03c8 = 0,\n(2)\ni\nwhich is obtained by taking the scalar product of the wave function with the Klein-Gordon equation (1). We may\nnot know \u2202t E initially at t = 0, but E and \u2202t E can presumably be evaluated self-consistently and iteratively, when\nwe succeed in getting the equations (Eq. (7) below) that allow us to advance the wave function to the next time step.\nFollowing Feshbach and Villars [4], we introduce the auxiliary wave function \u03c84 to represent the time-derivative of\nthe wave function \u03c8,\n(i~\u2202t \u2212 eA0 )\u03c8 = (E \u2212 e\u03bd A0 )\u03c84 .\n\n(3)\n\nOur definition of \u03c84 in the above equation differs from that of Feshbach and Villars [4], where the right-hand side\nis given as m\u03c84 . The present definition exhibits better the relativistic properties of the momentum variables and\n\n\f3\nfacilitates the representation of the Klein-Gordon equation in relativistic hydrodynamics. The Klein-Gordon equation\n(1) becomes\n\u001b\n\u001a\n~\n1\n2\n2\n0\n(4)\n(\n\u2207\n\u2212\neA)\n+\n(m\n+\nS)\n]\u03c8\n\u2212\n[i~\u2202\n(E\n\u2212\neA\n)]\u03c8\n(i~\u2202t \u2212 eA0 )\u03c84 =\nt\n4 .\nE \u2212 e\u03bd A0\ni\nWe define the particle and antiparticle components \u03c7\u00b1 of the state \u03bd as linear combinations of \u03c8 and \u03c84 ,\n1\n\u03c7+ = \u221a [\u03c8 + \u03c84 ]\n2\n1\n\u03c7\u2212 = \u221a [\u03c8 \u2217 \u2212 \u03c84\u2217 ]\n2\n\n(5)\n1\nor \u03c7\u2217\u2212 = \u221a [\u03c8 \u2212 \u03c84 ].\n2\n\n(6)\n\nOur definition of \u03c7\u2212 in Eq. (6) contains a complex conjugation that is different from the definition of \u03c7\u2212 of Feshbach\nand Villars [4]. Such a modification allows one to obtain a Schr\u00f6dinger equation for \u03c7\u2212 that contains the kinetic\nenergy operator (p \u2212 eA)2 /2(E \u2212 e\u03bd A0 ), instead of a kinetic energy operator with the opposite sign in Feshbach and\nVillars [4]. In terms of the wave functions \u03c7+ and \u03c7\u2212 as defined in Eqs. (5) and (6), equations (3) and (4) become\n\u001b\n\u001a\n1\n~\n0\n2\n2\n0 2\n0\n(i~\u2202t \u2212 e\u00b1 A )\u03c7\u00b1 =\n( \u2207 \u2212 e\u00b1 A) + (m + S) + [(E \u2212 e\u03bd A ) \u2212 i~\u2202t (E \u2212 e\u03bd A )] \u03c7\u00b1\n2(E \u2212 e\u03bd A0 )\ni\n\u001a\n\u001b\n1\n~\n2\n2\n0 2\n0\n+\n( \u2207 \u2212 e\u00b1 A) + (m + S) \u2212 [(E \u2212 e\u03bd A ) \u2212 i~\u2202t (E \u2212 e\u03bd A )] \u03c7\u2217\u2213 ,\n(7)\n2(E \u2212 e\u03bd A0 )\ni\nwhere e\u00b1 = \u00b1e. Thus we obtain the central result that the Klein-Gordon equation can be reduced to a set of two\ntime-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equations in which the particle and the antiparticle appear as distinct types of particles\nwith opposite charges e\u00b1 with the particle wave function \u03c7+ and the antiparticle wave function \u03c7\u2212 . A general solution\nof the Klein-Gordon equation contains two components that can be represented by a column vector,\n\u0012 \u0013\n\u03c7+\n\u03a8=\n.\n(8)\n\u03c7\u2212\nBoth \u03c7+ and \u03c7\u2212 have positive norms, |\u03c7\u00b1 |2 , which can be interpreted as the probability densities of particles and\nantiparticles respectively, as in hydrodynamics.\nNote that our denominator in Eqs. (7) differs from the denominator of m in the formulation of Feshbach and Villars\n[4]. The relativistic properties of the momentum variable are more apparent in Eq. (7). These relativistic properties\nwill facilitate the subsequent representation of the Klein-Gordon equation in relativistic hydrodynamical form.\nThe second term of the new equation (7) represents the particle-antiparticle coupling and pair production. It is\nproportional to ((~/i)\u2207 \u2212 e\u00b1 A)2 + (m + S)2 \u2212 [(E \u2212 e\u03bd A0 )2 \u2212 i~\u2202t (E \u2212 e\u03bd A0 )] and involves essentially the deviation\nof E 2 from p2 + m2 that increases with the strength of the interaction. The coupling is inversely proportional to the\nenergy (or mass) of the particle. The particle-antiparticle coupling and the rate of pair production are large, when\nthe strength of the interaction relative to the rest mass of the particle is large [10, 28, 29]. The particle-antiparticle\ncoupling is small when the strength of the interaction relative to the energy (or mass) of the particle is small.\nFor stationary states \u03c7\u00b1 with e\u03bd = n\u03bd e = \u00b1e in static external fields, Eq.

With time-dependent external fields, the energy of the single-particle state changes because energy may be\nsupplied or removed by the external fields. We envisage conceptually that a two-component wave function \u03a8(r, t) =\n(\u03c7+ (r, t), \u03c7\u2212 (r, t)) for the state \u03bd with e\u03bd = n\u03bd e is initially known as t = 0. The knowledge of the initial wave\nfunctions allows us to obtain E from Eq. (2) and to construct \u03c7+ and \u03c7\u2212 at the next time step with the help of Eq.\n(5) and (6). In the initial evaluation of E and in the subsequent stepwise increment of the wave function in time, we\nneed the quantity \u2202t E(t), which may be self-consistently determined by an iterative procedure.\nAfter the wave function \u03a8 has been advanced to the next time step, we can evaluate E(t) using Eq. (2) that is a\nquadratic equation in E. It contains both a positive-E and a negative-E solution. We shall limit our attention only\n\n\f4\non the positive-E solution so that we can speak of both particle and antiparticles states of positive energies. This\nstepwise increment allows the determination of the evolution of the state \u03a8(r, t) and E(t) as a function of time.\nTo see how the probability fluids behave in space and time, we write the wave functions \u03c7\u00b1 in terms of the amplitude\nand phase functions,\n\u03c7\u00b1 (r, t) = \u03c6\u00b1 (r, t)eiS\u00b1 (r,t)/~\u2212i\u03a9(t) .\n\n(10)\n\nWe construct \u03c7\u2217\u00b1 \u00d7(7)-\u03c7\u00b1 \u00d7(7)\u2217 .

The rate of the\nparticle-antiparticle pair production depends on the strength of the external interaction relative to the particle rest\nmass. In the case of a strong interaction and large pair production probabilities, a hydrodynamical description will\nbe complicated as it will involve a component that describes the pair production process.\nA hydrodynamical description will be appropriate after the active pair production stage has passed and the expansion of the system is driven by a slowly varying external field or a mean field. It is this type of motion for which we\nwish to provide a hydrodynamical description. This is the case when the interaction is present but not large compared to the rest mass, so that the probability of pair production is small, and can be suppressed in the lowest-order\napproximation. This is equivalent to the case of a \"simple fluid\" in relativistic hydrodynamics, in which the chemical\ncomposition of the fluid ceases to change [30]. In such circumstances, one can speak of a single-particle system with\na definite particle number n\u03bd , which can take on n\u03bd = 1, \u22121 values. We shall now consider this simplifying case with\nsuppressed pair production by discarding the last four terms in the curly bracket on the right hand-side of Eq. (17).\nAfter dividing by \u22122\u03c62\u00b1 , the equation for the phase function S\u00b1 for this simplified case is\n\u001a\n1\n0\n(\u2202t S\u00b1 + e\u00b1 A ) =\n[(\u22072 \u03c6\u00b1 )/\u03c6\u00b1 \u2212 (\u2207S\u00b1 \u2212 e\u00b1 A)2 ]\n2(E \u2212 e\u03bd A0 )\n\u001b\n2\n0 2\n(18)\n\u2212(m + S) \u2212 (E \u2212 e\u03bd A ) .\nFor this case with suppressed pair production, e\u03bd = n\u03bd e = e\u00b1 . We take the gradient \u2207i of the above for i = 1, 2, 3,\nand multiply by \u03c62\u00b1 (E \u2212 e\u00b1 A0 ).

The third term on the right-hand side is the relativistic\ncorrection to the time-like part of the vector interaction, and the last two terms represent relativistic corrections\nassociated with the spatial and temporal variation of the scalar interaction. Thus the dynamics of the probability\nfluid obeys an equation similar to the hydrodynamical equation, with forces on fluid elements arising from what one\n(q)\nexpects in classical considerations.

Each single-particle state \u03c8a\u03bd is\ncharacterized by a state label a, particle type \u03bd, energy e\u03bd , and occupation number na\u03bd . For simplicity, we consider\nthe case in which the mean-field potential arises from a scalar two-body interaction vs (r1 , r2 ) and a time-like vector\ninteraction v0 (r1 , r2 ). We further neglect the last three terms on the right-hand side of Eq. (23) which represent\nhigher-order relativistic corrections.

The quantum\nstress tensor is less sensitive to the degree of thermalization as compared to the thermal stress tensor. In the timedependent mean-field description, the motion of each particle state can be individually followed [35]. The occupation\nnumbers na\u03bd of the single-particle states will remain unchanged, if there are no additional residual interaction between\nthe single particles due to residual interactions. When particle residual interactions are allowed as in the extended\ntime-dependent mean-field approximation [36], the occupation numbers will change and will approach an equilibrium\ndistribution as time proceeds.\nWe note that the total pressure arises from many sources. We come to the observation that in situations when\n(t)\n(v)\n(q)\n|pij + pij | \u226b pij for a strongly-coupled system at low and moderate temperatures, there can be situations when the\nsystem behaves quasi-hydrodynamically, even though the state of the system has not yet reached thermal equilibrium.\nIn this case, the hydrodynamical state is maintained mainly by the quantum stress tensor and the strong mean fields.\nWhat we have discussed in this Section is only a theoretical framework that exhibits clearly the different sources\nof stress tensors. To study specifically the dynamics of the quark-gluon plasma, for example, it will be necessary to\ninvestigation the specific nature of different constituents and their interactions. Nevertheless, the general roles played\nby the different components of stress tensors can still be a useful reminder on the importance of the quantum and\nmean-field stress tensors in the strongly-coupled regime, at temperature just above the transition temperature Tc .\nV.\n\nCONNECTION TO THE KINETIC THEORY\n\nThe foundation of hydrodynamics is usually presented within the framework of kinetic theory, in which particles\nand antiparticles are described as distinct constituents and their interactions are weak [24\u201327]. In such a description,\nparticles are considered to be approximately on-the-mass-shell, and their inter-particle collisions lead to thermalization.\nThe state of the system for particles or antiparticles of type \u03bd is described by a distribution function f\u03bd (r, p; t) in\nphase space. Successive gradient expansions of small deviations from the equilibrium distribution lead to various\napproximations of the transport coefficients. The time-dependencies of the moments of various kinematic operators\nlead to hydrodynamical equations. The near-mass-shell condition restricts its application to systems with weak\ninteractions that can be taken as perturbations in quantum field theory.\nFor a dense and strongly interacting system, such as a nucleus or a strongly-coupled quark-gluon plasma, a reasonable description of a non-equilibrium system can be formulated in a different approach, the quantum probability\ndensity approach considered here. In this approach, constituents of the quantum system move in the strong mean\nfields generated by all other particles. Each particle executes its single-particle motion in the time-dependent mean\nfield, and the residue interaction between particles lead to \"collisions\" that change the single-particle state occupation\nnumbers na\u03bd . These residual-interaction collisions occur in such a way that the single particle occupation numbers\napproaches a thermal distribution as a function of time [36].\nIn the quantum probability density approach, as the particles resides in a strong field, they are off-the-mass shell\nand their energies depend on their local potential. The dynamics of each single particle state is described by a\nwave function with a positive probability density and a probability current. The equations for the total probability\ndensity and probability current are analogous to the relativistic hydrodynamical equations. The stress tensors in\nsuch a description arises from many components: the quantum stress tensor, the thermal stress tensor, and the\nmean-field interaction stress tensor. The behavior of the dynamics in such a quantum description need not be the\nsame as classical hydrodynamics because the constitutive equations relating various stress components with densities\nand other attributes may respond differently to the evolving dynamics [38]. We mention earlier that in situations in\nwhich the quantum stress tensor and interaction stress tensor dominate over the thermal stress tensor, the degree of\nthermalization may not be important in the hydrodynamical behavior of the system. In the other extreme when the\nstress tensor arises predominantly from the thermal stress tensor, the dynamics will then depend on the degree of\nthermal equilibrium.\nAlthough the quantum probability density approach is particularly appropriate for cases of strongly interacting\nquantum systems, it also has a well-defined classical and weak-coupling limit that should coincide with the kinetic\ntheory approach. It is therefore instructive to investigate how the two approaches are connected by studying how\n\n\f9\nthe equation of motion for the Wigner function, derived from the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equations representing\nthe Klein-Gordon equation, can be related to the equation of motion for the phase space distribution function in the\nkinetic theory, in the classical weak-field and collisionless limit.\nBoth in the present quantum probability density approach and the kinetic theory approach, the application to\nrelativistic hydrodynamics are confronted with the problem of pair production in which the interactions will lead\nto spontaneous production of particle-antiparticle pairs [28, 29]. The standard hydrodynamics is one in which pairproduction probability is suppressed. The equation of motion of the single-particle state of particle type \u03bd is then\nobtained from Eq. (7) by neglecting the second term on the right-hand side. We further consider the motion to be\nsufficiently slow so that we can neglect the term \u2202t (E \u2212 e\u03bd A0 ). The equation of motion for the single-particle state is\nthen\n\u001a\n\u001b\n1\n~\n0\n2\n2\n0 2\n(i~\u2202t \u2212 e\u03bd A )\u03c7\u03bd =\n( \u2207 \u2212 e\u03bd A) + (m + S) + [(E \u2212 e\u03bd A ) ] \u03c7\u03bd ,\n(39)\n2(E \u2212 e\u03bd A0 )\ni\nwhich can be written as\ni~\u2202t \u03c7\u03bd =\n\n1\n2(E \u2212 e\u03bd A0 )\n\n\u001a\n\u001b\n~\n( \u2207 \u2212 e\u03bd A)2 \u03c7\u03bd + V (r)\u03c7\u03bd ,\ni\n\n(40)\n\nwhere\nV (r) =\n\n\u001a\n\nE + e\u03bd A0\n(m + S)2\n+\n0\n2(E \u2212 e\u03bd A )\n2\n\n\u001b\n\n.\n\n(41)\n\nFrom this time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equation, we wish to obtain the corresponding equation of motion for the\nsingle-particle Wigner function. The construction of a gauge invariant Wigner function from the density matrix\nin the presence of an external gauge field (A0 , A) has been examined by many authors [39\u201348], and we can follow\nsimilar procedures. We construct \u03c7\u2020\u03bd (r1 , t)\u03c7\u03bd (r2 , t) and introduce (r1 + r2 )/2 = r, and r1 \u2212 r2 = s.

This indicates that the quantum equation of motion for\nthe Wigner function contains transcendental functions of the operators ~\u2207p * \u2207r applying on the potential and the\n\n\f10\nWigner function. The expansion of the sine function will lead to a power series in ~. We see here that the equation\nof motion for the distribution function in kinetic theory corresponds only the lowest order approximation in such an\nexpansion. We note also that the Wigner function is in general not identical to the distribution function because it\ncan take on negative values [49, 50]. In the classical limit, the Wigner function can be confined to be positive and be\nidentified with the phase space distribution function.

In our new set of coupled\ntime-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equations (7) the particle and the antiparticle components are better separated, and the\nkinetic energy operator in the equation for the antiparticle component is in the proper form of (p \u2212 eA)2 /2(E \u2212 e\u03bd A0 ),\nwith a positive sign. The relativistic properties of the momentum variables in the coupled time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger\nequations are more apparent and their connection to relativistic hydrodynamics can be easily established.\nWe introduce amplitude and phase functions to cast the time-dependent Schr\u00f6dinger equations into hydrodynamical\nform. We find that the equation of motion of the probability fluid of Klein-Gordon particles or antiparticles can be\nwritten in the form of relativistic hydrodynamics, with an additional quantum stress tensor. The other components\nof the hydrodynamical equation have their classical counterparts.\nFor simplicity, we have suppressed the pair-production degree of freedom in the present investigation. The pair\nproduction is however a quantum phenomenon that can be studied by using the Klein-Gordon equation, as was carried\nout in Ref. [29] to examine the Schwinger mechanism. The presence of the pair-production mechanism is a new feature\nin the hydrodynamical evolution. Since energy and momentum is diverted into pair production, the pair-production\ncorresponds to a dissipative process, and will contribute to the viscosity of the fluid. Future investigations to include\nthis pair-production in relativistic hydrodynamics will be of great interest.\nAs both the Schr\u00f6dinger equation and the Klein-Gordon equation can be cast into a hydrodynamical form, one\nmay inquire whether the Dirac equation can also be written in hydrodynamical form. It is well known that the Dirac\nequation can be reduced to a Klein-Gordon equation, with additional terms involving the spin and particle-antiparticle\ndegrees of freedom. For a Dirac particle in an external field we have\n{\u03b3 \u03bd (i\u2202\u03bd \u2212 eA\u03bd ) \u2212 (m + S)}\u03c8 = 0.\n\n(58)\n\nUpon multiplying this on the left by \u03b3 \u03bd (i\u2202\u03bd \u2212 eA\u03bd ) + (m + S), we obtain\n{(i\u2202\u03bd \u2212 eA\u03bd )2 \u2212 (m + S)2 \u2212 i\u03b1 * eE + \u03c3 * eB(r) \u2212 i[\u03b3 \u03bd \u2202\u03bd S]}\u03c8 = 0,\n\n(59)\n\nwhich is the Klein-Gordon equation with additional interactions. Thus, the Dirac equation can be likewise cast into\na hydrodynamical form, following the procedures outlined in the present manuscript.\nWe have thus far discussed particles and antiparticles with opposite charges interacting in a gauge field. For the\ncase of neutral particles, there is no interaction with the gauge field characterized by the charges e\u00b1 . However,\n\n\f12\nrelativistic doubling of states occurs and there are particles and antiparticles. How these neutral particles should\nbe treated will depend on their interaction with the external field. If the interactions of the neutral particle and\nantiparticle with the external fields are identical, it will not be necessary to distinguish between a particle and an\nantiparticle. It then becomes possible to construct a simplified theory in which only one degree of freedom enters\n(say, the particle's), with a neutral antiparticle taken to be identical to its corresponding neutral particle. On the\nother hand, if their interactions with the external fields are different, the two degrees of freedom are distinct. One can\nthen introduce additional quantum numbers to distinguish particles and antiparticles, and the present investigation\ncontaining different charges (or quantum numbers) for the new types of interaction will apply.\nIn the dynamics of a single-particle state in an external field, the external field can come internally from the singleparticle state probability density as in the Gross-Pitaevskii equation [31\u201334] or from the self-consistent mean-field in a\nmany-body system [14, 15]. A many-body system consists of a collection of various particles in their individual singleparticle states. For example, we can examine a many-body system in the time-dependent Hartree approximation in\nwhich particle and antiparticles move in a time-dependent self-consistent mean-field generated by all other particles.\nThe motion of each particle can be individually followed, as in the time-dependent mean-field approximation in a\nnuclear system [35]. The occupation numbers of these single-particle states will remain unchanged, if there are no\nadditional residual interaction between the single particles. When particle residual interactions are allowed as in the\nextended time-dependent mean-field approximation [36], the occupation numbers will change and will approach an\nequilibrium distribution. As the fluid density is cumulative in nature the dynamics of the many-body system will\nrely on the cumulative effects from particles in individual states. Thus, there will be a total quantum stress tensor\nthat is an important part of the equation of state of the many-body system. There will also be contributions from\nthe mean fields to the equation of states of the relativistic fluid as in the nuclear fluid [15]. The present investigation\nof Klein-Gordon single-particle states should be useful in the study of the dynamics of a many-body system using\nrelativistic hydrodynamics.\nThe foundation of hydrodynamics is usually presented within the framework of kinetic theory, we can compare the\npresent quantum probability density approach to the usual kinetic theory approach by determining the equation of\nmotion for the Wigner function using the time-dependent Schrod\u0308inger equation of the Klein-Gordon equation. Our\ncomparison indicates that the equation of motion for the distribution function in an external field in the kinetic theory\ncan be obtained from the quantum probability density approach in the limit of ~ \u2192 0 and weak fields. Thus, the\nquantum probability approach extends the range of hydrodynamics applications to situations where quantum effects\nand/or strong interactions are important.\nAcknowledgment\nThe author would like to thank Profs.
