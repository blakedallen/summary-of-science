Bartol Research Institute, University of Delaware, Newark, DE 19716\n(November 19, 2018)\nWe consider the effect of the Rashba spin-orbital interaction and space charge in a ferromagnetinsulator/semiconductor/insulator-ferromagnet junction where the spin current is severely affected\nby the doping, band structure and charge screening in the semiconductor. In diffusion region, if the\nthe resistance of the tunneling barriers is comparable to the semiconductor resistance, the magnetoresistance of this junction can be greatly enhanced under appropriate doping by the co-ordination\nbetween the Rashba effect and screened Coulomb interaction in the nonequilibrium transport processes within Hartree approximation.\nPACS numbers:73.40.-c,71.70.Ej,75.25.+z\n\ntween the Rashba spin-orbital interaction and the space\ncharge affect the spin transport in the double FIS junction? It was known that the Coulomb interaction may\nenhance the Rashba effect. In a one-dimensional Luttinger liquid formalism, Hausler has reported an enhancement of the Rashba effect due to the spin charge separation [20]. Such an enhancement was also found in a\ntwo-dimensional electron gas system [21]. However, the\neffect of the Rashba spin-orbital interaction in the diffusion region was thought to be not important. In this\nwork, we would like to investigate the co-ordination between the Rashba spin-orbital interaction and the space\ncharge effect in the double FIS junction in the nonequilibrium transport process. To completely solve the nonequilibrium problem with interactions is highly non-trivial.\nIt requires solving self consistently Boltzmann type spin\ntransport equation with the Poisson equation. What we\nwant to touch in this work is using a simple Hartree approximation to check if the effect comes from these interactions is significant. Consequently, it is found that\nif (i) the resistance of the tunneling barrier is comparable to the semiconductor resistance and (ii) the n-type\nsemiconductor has an appropriate doping, then while the\nmagnetoresistance of the junction is greatly enhanced as\nthe charge screening length becomes shorter as we already showed in [18], it is grown up as the Rashba spinorbital coupling. The shorter charge screening length\nis , the more gain in the magnetoresistance comes from\nthe Rashba term. Comparing with the non-interacting\nmodel where the Rashba effect may not be observed in\nthe diffusion region, we see a great increment of the magnetoresistance comes from the co-ordination between the\nRashba spin-orbital interaction and space charge effect.\n\nThe spintronics is interesting since this involves exploration of the extra degrees of freedom provided by electron spin, in addition to those due to electron charge,\nwhich is believed to be very useful in manipulating future electronic devices [1]. To realize such a spin device,\nthe Rashba spin-orbit interaction is often considered [2].\nSince this is caused by structural inversion asymmetry in\nquantum wells, it can be artificially controlled by adjusting the applied gate voltages and specifically designing\nthe heterostructure [3].\nOn the other hand, one of the current focus in spintronics lies in injecting spin polarized electrons into nonmagnetic semiconductors [4\u20139]. This is partially motivated by the high magnetoresistance observed in ferromagnet tunnel junctions [10]. However, in the diffusion\nregion and the room temperature, experiments have so\nfar observed a small magnetoresistance ratio of 1% [11,12]\nin ferromagnet/semiconductor/ferromagnet structures.\nRashba proposed a ferromagnetic metal/tunnelinginsulator/semiconductor (FIS) junction to improve the\nspin injection rate [15]. Many different geometries of the\ntunneling junction were discussed in Ref. [16]. It is possible that to lift the magnetoresistance to near 10% with\na very high electric field [17].\nIn a recent work [18], we investigated the space charge\neffect in the nonequilibrium transport process within the\nHatree approximation and found that the magnetoresistance of a double FIS junction could be greatly increased if one carefully adjusts the parameters of the\njunction, such as the charge screening length and the\nsize of the semiconductor. The space charge effect in the\nnonequilibrium transport process first was found playing an important role in the characteristics of the device of ferromagnetic/non-magnetic/ferromagnetic metal\njunction [19]. Under steady state nonequilibrium conditions, a magnetization dipole layer much larger than the\ncharge dipole layer is induced at the interface while the\nmagnetization dipole layer is zero under equilibrium conditions. We have applied this idea to the double FIS\njunction [18].\nWe now ask the question: How do co-ordinations be-\n\nRashba Spin-Orbital Coupling: We consider a twodimensional electron gas in a narrow gap quantum well,\nsuch as those based on InAs. The spin-orbital coupling\nin this kind of systems is dominated by Rashba term [22]:\nHso = \u03b1(\u03c3x py \u2212 \u03c3y px ),\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03c3x,y are the Pauli matrices and the Rashba param1\n\n\feter \u03b1 is determined by the asymmetry of the potential\nconfining the electrons in the two-dimensional x-y plan\nand can be controlled by a gate voltage [3]. For the system we are considering, its value is about 10\u221212 \u2212 10\u221211\neVm [23]. For a double FIS junction where the current\nflows in the x-direction, we can estimate the spin dependence of the density of state and the resistance of the\nelectron gas. According to the Rashba term (1), the single particle dispersion reads\nE\u03c3 =\n\nh\u03042 k\u03c32\n+ \u03c3\u03b1k\u03c3 ,\n2m\u2217\n\n\u2207*j= \u2212\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03c1 is the charge density.\n(2) The spin s-dependent current is determined by the\ndiffusion equations. In order to allow an analytic analysis, we take a simple Hartree approximation into account\nto see the space charge effect. Under such an approximation, the diffusion equations reads [19]\njs = \u03c3s (\u2207\u03bcs \u2212 \u2207W0 + E),\n\n(2)\n\n(5)\n\nwhere the magnitude of the electric charge has been\nset as one; E is the external electric field; the chemical potential \u03bcs is related to the charge density \u03c1s by\ns\n\u2207\u03bcs = \u2207\u03c1\nwhere Ns is the spin-dependent density of\nNs R\nstate. W0 = d~r\u2032 Uint (~r \u2212 ~r\u2032 )\u03c1(~r\u2032 ) is the potential caused\nby the screened Coulomb interaction Uint (~r) and \u2207W0 is\nthe so-called screening field induced by Uint (~r).\n(3) The third is the magnetization relaxation equation\nwhere the magnetization density M = \u03c1\u2191 \u2212 \u03c1\u2193 relaxes\nwith a renormalized spin diffusion length l. In the relaxation time approximation, one has\n\nwhere m\u2217 \u2248\u2217 0.04me for the bare electron mass me and\nk\u03c3 = k+\u03c3 mh\u03042\u03b1 ; \u03c3 is called spin-orbital coupling label [24].\nThe Rashba spin-ortial interaction contributes a current\njso to the system. However, in the diffusion region, such\nan effect may be small [24]. Here, we would like to see\nanother effect arising from the Rashba term. When the\nRashba term is non-zero, it is easy to see the density of\nso\nstate NN\nis given by [24]\nso\nNN\n= NFN (1 + \u03b1N ),\n\n\u2202\u03c1\n,\n\u2202t\n\n(3)\n\nwhere NFN is the density of state at the Fermi surface\nof the semiconductor for \u03b1 = 0 and \u03b1N = h\u0304v\u03b1F for the\nFermi velocity vF . It is seen that the density of state\nis not \u03c3-dependent [24]. For a typical two-dimensional\nelectron gas, the electron density is of order\u221a\u03c1e = 1011\nkF\nh\u0304\nand 1012 cm\u22122 . Thus, using vF = m\n2\u03c0\u03c1e , \u03b1N\n\u2217 = m\u2217\n\u22122\n\u22123\nis in order of 10 and 10 . In the following, we will see\nthat the magnetoresisatnce of the double FIS junction\nis very sensitive to the change of the charge screening\nlength which is determined by the density of state.\n\n\u22072 M \u2212 M/l2 = 0.\n\n(6)\n\n(4) The boundary conditions at the interfaces are given\nby\n\u2206\u03bc\u0303s \u2212 \u2206W = r(1 \u2212 s\u03b3)js ,\n\n(7)\n\nwhere \u03bc\u0303s = \u03bcs + Ex; Ex is the voltage drop on the left\nside of the barrier and \u2206W is the electric potential drop\nacross the barrier, which is assumed much smaller than\n\u2206\u03bcs ; rs = r(1 \u2212 s\u03b3) is the barrier resistance. We assume\nthat there is no spin relaxation in the insulator, the spindependent currents are continuous across the junctions,\njsL (\u2212d1 /2) = jsN (d1 /2) and jsR (x0 + d2 /2) = jsN (x0 \u2212\nd2 /2).\nIn addition, we have the neutrality condition for the\nR x +d /2\ntotal charges (QL,N,R , e.g., QN = d10/2 1 \u03c1dx) accumulated at the interfaces. By Gauss' law, for the point\nd1 /2 < x < x0 + d1 /2, i.e., inside the semiconductor, the\npotential W0 is determined by\nZ x\n\u2207W0 (x) = 4\u03c0QL + 4\u03c0\n\u03c1dx,\n(8)\n\nDescription of the Junction: In the diffusion region and\nthe room temperature, we consider the junction F1-I1-SI2-F2 along the x-direction. The thickness of the metal\n(F1, F2), the insulating barriers (I1, I2) and the semiconductor (S) are denoted by LL,R , d1,2 and x0 , respectively\n(See, Figure 1). For the practical case, x0 is less than the\nspin diffusion length lN of the two-dimensional electron\ngas in the semiconductor. The charge screening lengths\nin the metal and the semiconductor are denoted by \u03bbL,R\nand \u03bbN , respectively. In our model, we assume \u03bbN \u226a lN\nand \u03bbR,L \u226a lR,L , the spin diffusion lengths in the metal.\nTypically, \u03bb \u223c 10\u22121 nm, l \u223c 101 nm, and lN > 1\u03bcm.\nx0 \u223c 100nm to 1\u03bcm, depending on the structure of junctions. The screening length in the semiconductor, \u03bbN , is\ndependent on the doping of the semiconductor and can\nvary in a wide range, say 10nm for the heavy doped semiconductor and 100nm-1\u03bcm for the lightly doped or undoped semiconductor. To avoid discussing the spin-orbit\nsplitting of the heavy and the light-holed bands near the\nzone center, we consider the n-type semiconductor only.\nThe problem we would like to solve has been defined\nin [19,18]. Summarily, it is four sets of equations\n(1) The total charge-current conservation is described by\n\nd1 /2\n\nwhose constant part of the right hand side gives the constraint on the charge while the x-dependent part gives the\nfunction form of the potential W0 . Another constraint is\nthe neutrality of the system:\nQL + QN + QR = 0.\n\n(9)\n\nWith those sets of equations (Eqs.(4)-(7)) and the two\nconstraint on the charges (Eqs.(8) and (9)), the problem\ncan be solved. The formal solutions of the problem are\n\n2\n\n\f\u03c1L (x) =\n\n\u03bbL L (x+d1 /2)/\u03bbL \u03bb2L L (x+d1 /2)/lL\n+ 2 \u03c120 e\n\u03c1 e\n,\nlL 10\nlL\n\nM L (x) = M0L (1 \u2212\n\n\u03bb2L (x+d1 /2)/lL\n,\n2 )e\nlL\n\nEq. (13) implies that the spin-dependent current js (0)\npassing the interface differs a factor As from the noninteracting current j0s (0).

Since jso has been\nneglected, there is no observable Rashba effect without\ninteractions. After the interaction is included, the ratio\n(17) grows greatly and the Rashba effect is enhanced as\n\u03bbN becomes smaller. This can be clearly seen in Figs. 2\nand 3. We take x0 = 1.25\u03bcm, \u03bb = 0.1nm, l = 20nm, and\nlN = 3\u03bcm and set \u03b1 = \u03b2 = 1/2. The different choice of \u03b1\nand \u03b2 will not qualitatively affect the result if they do not\ndeviate from 1/2 too much. In Fig. 2, we depict the magnetoresistance versus the bias voltage for \u03bbN = 100nm\nwith \u03b1N from 0 to 0.05. It is seen that \u2206R/R raises\nfrom 16% to 18% when \u03b1N from 0 to 0.05. In Fig. 3,\nfor \u03bbN = 50nm, it is shown that the Rashba effect lifts\nmuch faster. \u2206R/R raises from 25% to 30% for \u03b1N from\n0 to 0.05. Hence, we see a strong co-ordination between\nthe Rashba spin-orbital and the screened Coulomb interactions to increase the magnetoresistance. While the\nCoulomb interaction largely enhances the magnetoresistance, the Rashba spin-orbital interaction may enhance\n\u2206R/R. This kind of Rashba effect becomes more significant in a shorter charge screening length.\nIn conclusions, we have shown the co-ordination between the Rashba spin-orbital and screened Coulomb\ninteractions on electron injection from ferromagnet to\nsemiconductor. The magnetoresistance grows fast as the\ncharge screened length in the semiconductor becomes\nshorter. The Rashba term also enhances the magnetoresistance and plays more important role as the Coulomb\ninteraction is stronger. In fact, by a chose examination\n\n(12)\n\nRd\nwhere \u03bas (\u03bc) \u221d 0 dx[2m(U \u2212 \u2206\u03bcs (0)x/d)]1/2 , with U the\nbarrier height.

From these, we obtain the magne=\ns s\nRAP\ntoresistance ratio\n\nThe spin-dependent currents: It is necessary to simplify\nthe problem to demonstrate the essential physics. One\nsets the parameters of the metals and barrier widths on\nthe left and right sides to be the same: \u03bbR = \u03bbL = \u03bb,\nlL = lR = l, d1 = d2 = d and so on. The resistances of\nthe barrier layers are taken as r(1) = r(2) = r; \u03b31 = \u03b32 =\n\u03b3 for the parallel configuration and \u03b31 = \u2212\u03b32 = \u03b3 for\nthe anti-parallel configuration. To illustrate, we focus on\nthe calculation in the left barrier located at x = 0. The\ntunneling resistance is given by\n\nAs = 1 +\n\n3/2\n\n2\n\nM (1),(2) can be obtained similarly.

Because our solution is very sensitive to \u03bbN , it is understood\nthat why a small spin-orbital coupling can cause a relative large gain in the magnetoresistance.\nThis work was partially supported by the NSF of\nChina.\n\n[16]\n[17]\n[18]\n[19]\n\n[20]\n[21]\n[22]\n[1] G.
