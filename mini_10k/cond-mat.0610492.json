Rotational distortions\nin crystals relax into wall structures formed from arrays\nof dislocations.49 It would seem natural to describe the\nformation and evolution of these mesoscale dislocation\nstructures using a continuum dislocation density theory.\nIndividual dislocations are associated with long-range\nstress fields, and the dislocation evolution and structure formation is strongly constrained by the need to\nscreen these stresses. In the 1950s, a number of authors1,2,3,4,5,6 (building on ideas from differential geometry) developed such a continuum description involving\nthe coarse-grained net topological charge of the dislocations in a region, organized into dislocation density tensor named for Nye. Since the long-range stress fields\nand the rotational distortions only depend upon the net\ndislocation density, it is natural for us to use this order\nparameter to describe the connections between rotations,\ndislocations, and stress. In this manuscript, we provide\na systematic mathematical analysis of the relations between rotational deformations, domain walls, and dislocation stress within the framework of Nye's continuum\ndislocation density tensor.\nIn equilibrium, a large crystal with boundary conditions imposing a rotational deformation will relax by\nforming a few grain boundaries-sharp walls formed\nby dislocation arrays, separating perfect crystalline\ngrains, with elastic stress confined locally near the grain\nboundaries.50 In the continuum theory, the region of\nlocal elastic stress vanishes, and grain boundaries are\ndescribed as \u03b4-function dislocation densities with zero\n\nstress. We analyze stress-free dislocation walls in the\ncontinuum theory in section III, and connect them with\nFrank's formula7 for the dislocation content of grain\nboundaries in appendix A.\nAt high temperatures, an initially disordered or microscopically deformed material will approach equilibrium\nthrough the formation and coarsening of polycrystals-\nthe rotation gradients are confined to sharp grain boundaries, separating local regions of different orientations.\nAgain, the strain fields in a polycrystal are confined to\nsmall regions around the grain boundaries. In the continuum dislocation theory a polycrystal is thus a stress-free\nconfiguration of dislocations. In section II, we derive the\nmost general solution for the dislocation density tensor\nwith zero stress. In section III, we show that this solution can be decomposed into a superposition of flat\ngrain boundaries. In appendix B and figure 3 we explicitly represent a (zero-stress) curved grain boundary as a\ncontinuum superposition of flat walls. In section IV, we\nalso show that the most general stress-free state can be\nrepresented in terms of a local rotation field. Hence the\nstress-free states in the continuum theory can be interpreted as polycrystals with arbitrarily small crystallites;\nthe strain energy for grain boundaries is zero, so the crystalline axes can vary arbitrarily in space. This would suggest that sharp, discrete wall formation is not implied by\nthe energetics within the continuum theory; recent work\nelsewhere8,9 has shown that they may nonetheless form\nvia shock formation in the natural dislocation dynamics.\nAt low temperatures, where mass transport by diffusion of vacancies and interstitial diffusion is frozen out,\nexternal strain is relieved by (volume-preserving) dislocation glide. The motion, entanglement, and multiplication of dislocations under this low-temperature\nplastic deformation leads to work hardening and\n\n\f2\nthe development of a yield stress.\nThese systems\nhave long been modeled using continuum dislocation\ntheories,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17 sometimes simplifying the\ndislocation density into a scalar quantity, but sometimes incorporating information not contained in the\nNye tensor ('geometrically unnecessary' dislocation densities with canceling topological charge, yield stress laws,\nand separate dislocation densities for each slip system, . . . ). Continuum dislocation theories have been\nimportant not only in understanding large-scale discrete dislocation simulations,11,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,27\nbut also in understanding emergent dislocation avalanche\nphenomena.12,18,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35 At large deformations (stage III plasticity), these tangles of dislocations\nbegin to organize again into walls (here called cell walls)\nseparating largely undeformed regions36,37,38,39,40,41 with\nsmall misorientation angles between cells (again potentially explained by a shock formation in the climb-free\ndynamical evolution law8,9 ). In section V we provide\nthe relation between the local rotation field for a general dislocation density tensor, which (for general stressful densities) is a formula providing a least-squares best\napproximation for the local orientation of the crystalline\naxes.\nII.\n\nTHE GENERAL STRESS-FREE\nDISLOCATION DENSITY\n\nA dislocation is a crystallographic defect representing\nextra rows or columns of atoms and is characterized by\ntwo quantities; its line direction t, and its Burgers vector\nb. After a passage around a closed contour C that encircles a dislocation line, a displacement field u receives an\nincrement b according to\nI\nI\nP\n\u03b2ij\ndxj = \u2212bi\n(1)\ndui =\nC\n\nC\n\nwhere \u03b2 P describes the irreversible plastic deformation.\nThe Nye dislocation density tensor \u03c1 is defined by \u03c1 =\n(t \u2297 b)\u03b4(\u03be) where \u03be is the two-dimensional radius vector\nmeasured from the axis of the dislocation in the plane\nlocally perpendicular to t. When many dislocations labeled by \u03b1 are present, a coarse-graining description of a\nconglomerate of dislocations is preferred. In this picture,\nXZ\n\u03b1\n\u2032\n\u03b1\n\u2032 3 \u2032\n\u03c1ij (x) =\nt\u03b1\n(2)\ni bj \u03b4(x \u2212 \u03be )G(x \u2212 x )d x ,\n\u03b1\n\nwith\nweighting\nG(x \u2212 x\u2032 )\n\u2243\n\u221a Gaussian\n3\n\u2032 2\n2\n(1/ 2\u03c0L) exp[\u2212(x \u2212 x ) /(2L )] over some distance scale L large compared to the distance between\ndislocations and small compared to the dislocation\nstructures being modeled. Since dislocation lines are\ntopological and cannot end inside the crystal, \u03c1 is\ndivergence free: \u2202i \u03c1ij = 0.\nA dislocation strains the crystal, and creates a longrange stress field.

The fact\nthat one needs two perpendicular sets of parallel dislocations comes out naturally in this formulation. Because\nthe number densities of the screw dislocations are the\nsame in both directions, n here denotes the number density in one of the two directions.\n\nDECOMPOSITIONS OF A STRESS FREE\nSTATE INTO FLAT FRANK WALLS\n\nThese three basis tensors can be used to describe grain\nboundaries. As an example, consider a tilt boundary in\nthe x-y plane constructed from a set of parallel dislocation lines pointing along the x\u0302 direction with the Burgers vector b pointing along the \u1e91 direction. Let\nn bereplacements\nthe\nPSfrag\nnumber of dislocation lines per unit length along \u0177. To\nmake a plane in real space, we need two \u03b4-functions in\nFourier space. The boundary is then written\nnb\n\u03b4(kx )\u03b4(ky )E x\nikz\n\uf8eb\n\uf8f6\n0 0 1\n= (2\u03c0)2 nb \u03b4(kx )\u03b4(ky ) \uf8ed0 0 0\uf8f8.\n0 0 0\n\n\u03c1etilt x\u0302 = (2\u03c0)2\n\nn\u0302\n\n\u03c9\n\u03b8\n\n\u1e91\n\n\u03c6\n\n\u2206\n\nIII.\n\nSimilarly, a twist boundary in the x-y plane can be\ngenerated by two sets of parallel dislocations oriented\nperpendicular to one another, one pointing in the x\u0302 direction while another pointing in the \u0177 direction. It can\nbe written simply as\n\n\u0177\n\n(10)\n\nNotice that, for low-angle boundaries (small n), the tilt\nmisorientation angle about the x\u0302 axis is given by \u03c9x = nb.\nWe can write this tilt boundary in terms of our\nstress-free basis function E x . But why is the tiltboundary stress free? Real grain boundaries have stresses\nfrom their constituent dislocations that cancel at long\ndistances-they decay exponentially with distance over\na length scale given by a typical distance between dislocations. Hence in the continuum limit where the dislocations become infinitely close together, the stress vanishes.\nEquivalently, the elastic energy of a boundary with low\nmisorientation angle \u03b8 goes as \u2212b \u03b8 log \u03b8, which vanishes\nin the continuum limit b \u2192 0. Grain boundaries mediating rigid rotations have vanishing stress in the mesoscale\ncontinuum dislocation theory.\n\nx\u0302\nFIG. 1: A general grain boundary whose normal is n\u0302 positioned at the distance \u2206 away from the origin separates two\nunstrained regions with a relative orientation defined by \u03c9.\n\nA general boundary on the x-y plane is the sum of\nthree types of boundary (a tilt along x\u0302, a tilt along \u0177,\nand a twist along \u1e91):\n\u03b4(kx )\u03b4(ky )\n\u03c9n E n ,\nikz\n(12)\nwhere \u03c9 is the Rodrigues vector giving the angle of misorientation across the wall.

(16)\n\nProof. To get a general stress-free dislocation distribution, one needs to integrate over three parameters denoting the misorientation between the two grains, two\nangles defining each boundary, and the position of each\ngrain component.\nTo show this, we substitute the form of a[\u03c9, \u03a9, \u2206] into\n\ne l [{kx , 0, 0}],\n= 2\u039b\n\n(18)\n\nP\nwhere we use \u03b4(g(x)) = a \u03b4(x \u2212 a)/|g \u2032 (a)|, and the sum\nis taken over all a's with g(a) = 0 and g \u2032 (a) 6= 0.43 The\n\u03b1 e\u03b1\nargument works for any k. Thus \u03c1eSF\nij (k) = Eij \u039b (k) is\nshown.\n\nOne must emphasize that this theorem does not explain the prevalence of grain boundaries. Most stressfree states will be formed by continuous superpositions\nof walls. Indeed, even a curved grain boundary will demand such a continuous superposition (see appendix B).\n\nIV. STRESS-FREE STATES AND\nCONTINUOUS ROTATIONAL DEFORMATIONS\n\nIn this section we show that the vector field \u039b(x) introduced in the previous section is precisely the Rodrigues\n\n\f5\nvector field giving the rotation matrix that describes the\nlocal orientation of the crystalline axes at position x.\nWhat is \u039bGB (x) associated with a grain boundary?\ne xy for a boundary lying in the x-y\nConsider the form of \u039b\nplane:\n\nwhere we use the definition of the Nye tensor in the last\nequality. This expression holds regardless of the enclosed\nsurface S, thus51\n\n(19)\n\nThus the stress-free distortions are precisely those generated by rotation fields, and its dislocation density tensor field is given by our decomposition (equation 23) with\n\u039b equal to the Rodrigues vector for the local rotation.\n\ne x-y (k) = (2\u03c0)2 \u03b4(kx )\u03b4(ky ) \u03c9\n\u039b\nikz\n\nThe inverse Fourier transform of this expression involves\nan integral over a semi-circular contour in the upper complex plane, resulting in\n\u039bx-y (x) =\n\n1\nsign[z]\u03c9.\n2\n\n(20)\n\nGB\n\nIn general, \u039b\nis found after proper translation and\nrotation of the plane:\n1\n(21)\n\u039b (x) = sign[n\u0302 * (x \u2212 \u2206)]\u03c9 .\n2\nThe vector \u039b(x) provides information about the local\ncrystal orientation at the point x relative to a fixed global\norientation. This is true in general:\nGB\n\nTheorem 2. The direction of \u039b gives the axis of rotation of the local crystal orientation with respect to a fixed\nglobal coordinates by the amount provided by its magnitude.\nIn other words, the Rodrigues vector \u039b(x) describes\nthe local crystal orientations due to the presence of the\nstress-free dislocation density field \u03c1SF .\nProof. First, note that\n\u03b1 e\u03b1\ne\ne\n\u03c1eSF\nij = Eij \u039b = ikj \u039bi \u2212 \u03b4ij ikm \u039bm ,\n\n(22)\n\nwhich, in real space, corresponds to\n\n\u03c1SF\nij = \u2202j \u039bi \u2212 \u03b4ij \u2202m \u039bm .\n\u2032\n\n(23)\n\n\u03b5jik \u039b\u2032k\n\nNow consider a rotation field Rij (\u039b ) = e\nwhere\n\u039b\u2032 (x) is the Rodrigues vector giving the local orientation, and we wish to argue that \u039b\u2032 can be used for \u039b.\nConsider a small Burgers circuit C enclosing a region S\nwith local orientation given by the field of \u039b\u2032 (x). Integrating around the circuit C, the net closure failure \u2212b\ndue to the plastic distortion \u03b2 P is given in terms of the\nlocal rotation R(\u039b\u2032 ) (see equation 1):\nI\nI\nP\n\u2212 bj =\n\u03b2ij dxi =\nRji (\u039b\u2032 (x)) dxi\n(24)\nC\n\nC\n\nApplying Stokes' theorem to equation 24 and noting that\nthe change in \u039b\u2032 is small inside the small circuit C, we\nobtain\nZ\nI\n\u2032\n\u03b5iln \u2202l (e\u03b5jnm \u039bm )dSi\nRji (\u039b\u2032 (x))dxi =\nC\nZS\n\u03b5iln \u2202l (\u03b4jn + \u03b5jnm \u039b\u2032m )dSi\n\u2243\nS\nZ\nZ\n\u2032\n=\n\u03b5iln \u03b5jnm \u039bm dSi = \u2212 \u03c1ij dSi ,\nS\n\nS\n\n(25)\n\n\u03c1ij = \u2212\u03b5iln \u03b5jnm \u039b\u2032m = \u2202j \u039b\u2032i \u2212 \u03b4ij \u2202m \u039b\u2032m .\n\n(26)\n\nV. EXTRACTING THE LOCAL\nMISORIENTATION FROM THE NYE TENSOR\n\ne\u03b1 \u03b1\nThe decomposition of \u03c1eSF\nij = \u039b Eij is somewhat different from the problem of breaking up a vector into projections on various basis vectors.

We showed,\nfrom first principles, that any stress\u2013free state can be decomposed into a superposition of flat walls (grain boundaries) and also can be written as a local rotational deformation field \u039b(x). Finally, we provide a relationship between this rotation field and the Nye dislocation density\ntensor, which in addition provides a formula for the best\nleast-squares approximation for the rotation field for a\nstressful dislocation density.\nThe analysis presented here forms the mathematical\nframework on which dynamical theories of continuum dislocation evolution are hung. It should offer basic tools\nfor interpreting these simulations (identifying walls, misorientations, and rotational deformations during the evolution under polycrystalline coarsening or plastic deformation), for theories based on the Nye tensor or more\nmicroscopic formulations. It should provide also a theoretical basis for interpreting wall formation in continuum theories; minimizing stress provides a rationale for\ncontinua of walls, but not for discrete, individual grain\nboundaries or cell walls.\nAPPENDIX A: FRANK'S FORMULA FOR A\nGENERAL GRAIN BOUNDARY: CONNECTION\nTO CONTINUUM THEORY\n\nFrank gave conditions on dislocation density for wall\nseparating two perfect crystals mis-aligned by a rigidbody rotation.7 Our analysis in section III explicitly generated such walls, leading to a condition (equation 14)\n\n\u2206\n\nn\u0302\n\nFIG. 2: The orientation of the plain is defined by the vector\nnormal n\u0302. The Rodrigues vector \u03c9 gives the axis of rotation\nand the angle of relative orientation between the two grains\nacross the boundary.\n\nUsing the Nye tensor, we can rephrase (A1) and then\ncompare it with our statement of stress-free boundaries.\nLet's start off by defining a Burgers circuit C enclosing a\nsurface S that intersects a grain boundary at two points\nxa and xb . The net Burgers vector encompassed by the\nsurface is b. Define V to be a vector lying in the boundary plane pointing from xa to xb , V \u2261 xb \u2212 xa . We can\nrepresent this grain boundary by a constant matrix \u03c10\nmultiplied by a plane defined by \u03b4(n\u0302 * (x \u2212 \u2206)), where n\u0302\nis a unit vector normal to the plane, and \u2206 is the perpendicular vector pointing from the origin to the plane.\n(See figure 2.) The integral of the Nye tensor \u03c1 on the\nsurface S gives the net Burgers vector b passing through\nthat surface:\nZ\nbj =\n\u03c1ij dSi\nZS\n(A2)\n0\n=\n\u03c1ij \u03b4(n\u0302 * (x \u2212 \u2206))[n\u0302 \u00d7 V\u0302]i dA\nS\n\n\f7\nThe \u03b4-function serves to collapse the area integral into a\nline integral since the value is zero outside of the plane\ndefined by x * n\u0302 = 0:\nZ xb\n\u03c10ij [n\u0302 \u00d7 V\u0302]i dl\nbj =\nxa\n\n= \u03c10ij xb \u2212 xa \u03b5imn n\u0302m V\u0302n\n\n(A3)\n\n= \u03c10ij \u03b5imn n\u0302m Vn\n\nWe can therefore relate the dislocation density to the\nrotation vector \u03c9 using Frank's formula (equation A1):\n\u03b5jpq Vp \u03c9q = \u03c10ij \u03b5imn n\u0302m Vn\n0 = \u03c10ij \u03b5imn n\u0302m Vn \u2212 \u03b5jmn Vm \u03c9n\nWith some relabeling, this becomes\n\u0001\n0 = \u03c10ij n\u0302m + \u03b4ij \u03c9m \u03b5imn Vn .\n\n(A4)\n\n(A5)\n\nSince V is an arbitrary vector in the plane of the grain\nboundary, we can write V as V = n\u0302\u00d7W for an arbitrary\nvector W. We can substitute n\u0302 \u00d7 W back into (A5),\n\u0001\n(A6)\n0 = \u03c10ij n\u0302m + \u03b4ij \u03c9m \u03b5imn \u03b5npq n\u0302p Wq .\nThis condition holds regardless of W. We can therefore\nsafely ignore W in the equation. The condition now becomes\n\u0001\n0 = \u03c10ij n\u0302m + \u03b4ij \u03c9m \u03b5imn \u03b5npq n\u0302p\n\u0001\n= \u03c10ij n\u0302m + \u03b4ij \u03c9m (\u03b4ip \u03b4mq \u2212 \u03b4iq \u03b4mp )n\u0302p\n(A7)\n= n\u0302i \u03c10ij n\u0302q + n\u0302j \u03c9q \u2212 \u03c10qj \u2212 \u03b4qj \u03c9p n\u0302p .\n\nThe first term goes to zero because the first index of \u03c10ij\ndesignates the line component which always lies in the\nplane of the boundary. By definition, n\u0302 is perpendicular\nto the plane, therefore, n\u0302i \u03c10ij = 0. The condition for \u03c10\nthat makes a valid grain boundary is thus\n\u03c10ij = \u03c9i n\u0302j \u2212 (\u03c9 * n\u0302)\u03b4ij ,\n\n(A8)\n\nthis coordinate, \u03be\u0302z is perpendicular to the plane of the\nboundary. The other two basis vectors lie in the plane of\nthe boundary.\nThe inverse transform can be written as\nZ\n1\nik*x 3\n\u03c1GB\n=\n\u03c1eGB\nd k\nij\nij e\n(2\u03c0)3\nZ\n\u22121\n\u22121\n\u03b4(Rxp\nkp )\u03b4(Ryq\nkq )\n1\nn ik*(x\u2212\u2206) 3\n\u03c9n Eij\ne\nd k\n=\n\u22121\n2\u03c0\niRzr kr\nZ\n1\n\u03b4(\u03bex )\u03b4(\u03bey )\nn ik*(x\u2212\u2206) 3\n=\n\u03c9n Eij\ne\nd \u03be.\n2\u03c0\ni\u03bez\n(A10)\nNote that since the new basis vectors are the rotation of\nthe original set, its Jacobian is one.

Metall. 1, 153 (1953).\nDisclinations, the topological defect suggested by homotopy theory applied to the broken rotational symmetry, are\nforbidden in bulk crystals because the broken translational\nsymmetry makes the long-range rotational distortions too\ncostly in energy; disclinations are screened by dislocations\narranged into grain boundaries.\nFor example, a cube of side L bent by a small misorientation angle \u03b8 has an elastic energy \u221d L3 \u03b82 which can\nbe relieved by introducing a grain boundary of energy\n\u221d L2 b \u03b8 log(1/\u03b8) where b is the length of the Burgers vector (a lattice constant). The grain boundary hence forms\nwhen the bending angle is larger than \u03b8c \u223c (b/L) log(L/b),\nwhich vanishes as L gets large. Interestingly, the net amplitude of deformation at the midpoint of the bent cube\nis (L/2)\u03b8c \u223c b log(L/b) \u223c b at the point where the grain\nboundary forms-just a few lattice constants. Hence elastic deformations at the boundary larger than a few lattice\nconstants will form grain boundaries47 .\nNye provided the relationships between the dislocation\ndensity tensor \u03c1 and the lattice curvature tensor \u03ba.48\nLet d\u03c6i be small lattice rotations about three coordinate\naxes, associated with the displacement vector dxj , then\n\u03baij \u2261 \u2202\u03c6i /\u2202xj . He shows that given a curvature tensor\n\u03ba the Nye dislocation tensor \u03c1 can be determined, i.e.,\n\u03c1ij = \u03baij \u2212 \u03b4ij \u03bakk . By comparing equation 23 with the\nabove expression we can identify \u2202j \u039bi with the lattice curvature tensor \u03baij in the stress-free regions.\nThere is a sign difference between the formula quoted here\nand that presented in Ref. 46. This is due to the discrepancy in defining the Burgers vector.\n\n\f"}
