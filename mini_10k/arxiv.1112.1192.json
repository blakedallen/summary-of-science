New\ninstability results are obtained for general circulatory and gyroscopic conservative systems. We\nalso apply this method for studying the instability of motion for a charged particle in a stationary\nelectromagnetic field.\n\nKeywords: instability, circulatory system, gyroscopic conservative system.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nMany physical phenomenons are modeled by second order Euler-Lagrange equations\n\u2202L\nd \u2202L\n\u2212 i = Qi ,\ni\ndt \u2202 q\u0307\n\u2202q\n\n(1.1)\n\nwhere L is the Lagrangian function and Qi are the components of generalized forces. The linearized\nequation at an equilibrium point has the form\nM q\u0308 + A2 q\u0307 + A3 q = 0,\n\n(1.2)\n\nwhere M is a constant symmetric matrix and A2 , A3 are constant matrices. The above system appears,\nfor example, in vibration theory and it is known as lumped-mass system (without external forces) (see\n[1]), where q is an n vector of time-varying elements representing the displacements of the masses.\nAssuming that M is invertible we multiply the equation (1.2) by the matrix M \u22121 . Using the notations\nD and K for the symmetric parts, respectively G and C for the skew-symmetric parts of M \u22121 A2 and\nM \u22121 A3 we obtain the following normal system, see [1], [2]\nq\u0308 + (D + G)q\u0307 + (K + C)q = 0.\n\n(1.3)\n\nIn literature, D is called the viscous damping matrix, G is the gyroscopic matrix, K is the stiffness\nmatrix and C is the circulatory matrix.\nAccording to [1] we have the following classification of the normal systems of the form (1.3):\n(i) conservative systems when D = G = C = 0 and K is positive definite;\n(ii) gyroscopic conservative systems or undamped gyroscopic systems when D = C = 0;\n\u2217 Corresponding author; West University of Timi\u015foara, Department of Mathematics, Bd.

We obtains these conditions using the Gramian of\na set of vectors whose coordinates are powers of the roots for the given polynomial. We explicitly write\nthree of these conditions, which turn out to be conditions involving only the power sums of the roots\nfor the given polynomial. In the case of a characteristic polynomial of a matrix, the above mentioned\nconditions are written only in terms of norms and traces of the symmetric and skew-symmetric parts of\nthe matrix.\nIn Section 3 we give sufficient conditions for the instability of circulatory systems. These conditions\ninvolve only the norms and traces of the stiffness matrix and the circulatory matrix. We recover\na sufficient condition previously found by Bulatovic in [3]. We also give an example of a circulatory\nsystem, which shows that the three sufficient conditions presented in this section give different instability\nregions.\nIn Section 4 we give sufficient conditions for the instability of gyroscopic conservative systems involving norms and traces of the stiffness matrix and the gyroscopic matrix. We apply these conditions\nfor the case of a charged particle acted by the Lorentz force. We also describe the regions of instability\nfor this system.\n\n2\n\nSufficient conditions for complex roots with non-zero imaginary part\n\nLet Q(\u03b1) = \u03b1n + a1 \u03b1n\u22121 + * * * + an be a n-degree polynomial with real coefficients. We denote by\n{\u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1n } the set of roots of the polynomial Q. We search for sufficient conditions in order to have\nat least one complex root with non-zero imaginary part.\nConsider the vectors:\nv0 = (1, . . . , 1);\nv1 = (\u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1n );\n..\n.\nvn\u22121 = (\u03b11n\u22121 , . . . , \u03b1nn\u22121 ).\nWe have the well-known result: if all roots of the polynomial Q are real, then for any 0 \u2264 i1 \u2264 * * * \u2264\nik \u2264 n \u2212 1 the following inequality holds\n\nGram(vi1 , . . . , vik ) :=\n\n< vi1 , vi1 >\n..\n.\n\n< vi1 , vik >\n..\n.\n\n< vik , vi1\n\n< vik , vik >\n\n...\n..\n.\n> ...\n\n\u2265 0.\n\nLemma 2.1. If there exist 0 \u2264 i1 < * * * < ik \u2264 n \u2212 1 such that\nGram(vi1 , . . . , vik ) < 0,\nthen the polynomial Q has at least one complex root with non-zero imaginary part.\nThe power sums of the roots are real numbers denoted by sk :=\n\nn\nP\ni=1\n\n\u03b1ik , where k \u2208 N. We notice that\n\nn\ns1\n..\n.\n\ns1\ns2\n..\n.\n\n...\n...\n..\n.\n\nsn\u22121\nsn\n..\n.\n\nsn\u22121\n\nsn\n\n...\n\ns2n\u22122\n\nGram(v0 , . . . , vn\u22121 ) =\n\n2\n\n.\n\n\fApplying Lemma 2.1 for the simple particular cases Gram(v0 , v1 ), and Gram(v0 , v2 ) and Gram(v1 , v2 )\nwe obtain the following sufficient conditions.\nProposition 2.2. If any of the inequalities hold\n(i) ns2 < s21 ;\n(ii) ns4 < s22 ;\n(iii) s2 s4 < s23 ,\nthen the polynomial Q has at least one complex root with non-zero imaginary part.\nConsidering Gramians of higher order, one can obtain similar sufficient conditions. We notice that\nthe inequalities (i) and (ii) hold when s2 < 0, respectively s4 < 0. Also, inequality (iii) holds, in\nparticular, when s2 < 0 and s4 > 0 or s2 > 0 and s4 < 0. If P (\u03bb) = Q(\u03bb2 ), then Proposition 2.2 gives\nsufficient conditions for the existence of a complex root with strictly positive real part of the polynomial\nP.\nAll the power sums sk can be expressed recurrently, using Newton formulas, in terms of the coefficients of Q only (see [4]):\nsk + a1 sk\u22121 + * * * + ak\u22121 s1 + kak = 0,\n1\u2264k\u2264n\nsk + a1 sk\u22121 + * * * + ak\u22121 sk\u2212n+1 + an sk\u2212n = 0,\nk > n.\nThe above recurrences and Lemma 2.1 give sufficient conditions for the existence of complex roots\nwith non-zero imaginary part exclusively in terms of the coefficients of the polynomial Q. More precisely,\nwe have the following result.\nProposition 2.3. The polynomial Q has at least one complex root with non-zero imaginary part if:\n(i)\nn\u22652:\n\nn(a21 \u2212 2a2 ) < a21 ;\n\n(ii)\nn=2:\n\na21 (a21 \u2212 4a2 ) < 0;\n\nn=3:\n\na41 + 6a1 a3 + a22 < 4a21 a2 ;\n\nn\u22654:\n\nn(a41 \u2212 4a21 a2 + 4a1 a3 + 2a22 \u2212 4a4 ) < (a21 \u2212 2a2 )2 ;\n\n(iii)\nn=2:\n\na22 (a21 \u2212 4a2 ) < 0;\n\nn=3:\n\na21 a22 + 10a1 a2 a3 < 2a31 a3 + 4a32 + 9a23 ;\n\nn\u22654:\n\na21 a22 + 10a1 a2 a3 + 8a2 a4 < 2a31 a3 + 4a21 a4 + 4a32 + 9a23 .\n\nFor the case when Q is the characteristic polynomial of a matrix M \u2208 Mn\u00d7n (R), i.e. Q(\u03b1) =\ndet(\u03b1In \u2212 M ), conditions (i), and (ii) and (iii) of Proposition 2.2 can be interpreted only in terms of the\nsymmetric and skew-symmetric parts of the matrix M . Any matrix M can be uniquely decomposed as\na sum of a symmetric part and a skew-symmetric part, M = Ms + Ma , where Ms = 21 (M + M T ) and\nMa = 21 (M \u2212 M T ).\nIn what follows, we will use the well-known equalities: Tr(A + B) = Tr(A) + Tr(B), and Tr(AB) =\nTr(BA) for any A, B \u2208 Mn\u00d7n (R) and Tr(AB) = 0 for any symmetric matrix A and any skew-symmetric\n\n3\n\n\fmatrix B. Furthermore, we have ||A||2 = Tr(AAT ) for any A = [aij ] \u2208 Mn\u00d7n (R), where ||A||2 :=\n\nP\ni,j\n\na2ij .\n\nConsequently, ||Ms ||2 = Tr(Ms2 ) and ||Ma ||2 = \u2212 Tr(Ma2 ). By a direct computation we have\ns1 = Tr(M ) = Tr(Ms );\ns2 = Tr(M 2 ) = Tr(Ms2 + Ma2 + Ms Ma + Ma Ms )\n= Tr(Ms2 + Ma2 ) = ||Ms ||2 \u2212 ||Ma ||2 ;\ns3 = Tr(M 3 ) = Tr((Ms + Ma )3 )\n= Tr(Ms3 + Ms Ma2 + Ms2 Ma + Ms Ma Ms + Ma Ms2 + Ma Ms Ma + Ma3 + Ma2 Ms )\n= Tr(Ms3 ) + 3 Tr(Ms Ma2 );\ns4 = Tr(M 4 ) = Tr((Ms + Ma )4 )\n= Tr(Ms4 ) + Tr(Ma4 ) + 4 Tr(Ms2 Ma2 ) + 2 Tr((Ms Ma )2 )\n= ||Ms2 ||2 + ||Ma2 ||2 \u2212 4||Ms Ma ||2 + 2 Tr((Ms Ma )2 ).\nThe next theorem is a completion of a result given in [3] and it follows by substituting the above\nexpressions for s1 , s2 , s3 , s4 in Proposition 2.2.\nTheorem 2.4. If one of the inequalities hold\n(i) n(||Ms ||2 \u2212 ||Ma ||2 ) < Tr2 (Ms );\n(ii) n(||Ms2 ||2 + ||Ma2 ||2 \u2212 4||Ms Ma ||2 + 2 Tr((Ms Ma )2 )) < (||Ms ||2 \u2212 ||Ma ||2 )2 ;\n(iii) (||Ms ||2 \u2212 ||Ma ||2 )(||Ms2 ||2 + ||Ma2 ||2 \u2212 4||Ms Ma ||2 + 2 Tr((Ms Ma )2 )) < (Tr(Ms3 ) + 3 Tr(Ms Ma2 ))2 ,\nthen the matrix M has at least one complex eigenvalue with non-zero imaginary part.\nFor n = 2, if Tr(M ) 6= 0, then the inequalities (i) and (ii) from the above theorem are equivalent.\nAs we will show later, this is not the case for n \u2265 3.\n\n3\n\nInstability for circulatory systems\n\nFirst we will give sufficient conditions of instability for a circulatory system subject to potential (conservative) and non-conservative positional (circulatory) forces\nq\u0308 + Kq + Cq = 0,\n\n(3.1)\n\nwhere K is symmetric and C is skew-symmetric. In [3] it has been showed that if the circulatory forces\nare bigger, in a certain sense, than the conservative forces, then the equilibrium point q = 0, q\u0307 = 0 is\nunstable. The characteristic polynomial of the system (3.1) is given by P (\u03bb) = det(\u03bb2 In + K + C). This\npolynomial contains only even powers of \u03bb. Denoting \u03bb2 = \u03b1 we obtain the characteristic polynomial\nQ(\u03b1) = det(\u03b1In + K + C) of the matrix M = \u2212(K + C). The existence of a complex root \u03b1 with\nnon-zero imaginary part implies the existence of a complex root \u03bb for the polynomial P with strictly\npositive real part. Thus, instability of the system (3.1) is implied by the existence of a complex root for\nthe polynomial Q(\u03b1). Applying Theorem 2.4 we obtain a different proof of a previous instability result\npresented in [3] and two new instability criteria.\nTheorem 3.1. If one of the following inequalities hold\n(i) ([3]) n(||K||2 \u2212 ||C||2 ) < Tr2 (K);\n(ii) n(||K 2 ||2 + ||C 2 ||2 \u2212 4||KC||2 + 2 Tr((KC)2 )) < (||K||2 \u2212 ||C||2 )2 ;\n(iii) (||K||2 \u2212 ||C||2 )(||K 2 ||2 + ||C 2 ||2 \u2212 4||KC||2 + 2 Tr((KC)2 )) < (Tr(K 3 ) + 3 Tr(KC 2 ))2 ,\n4\n\n\fthen the equilibrium point q = 0, q\u0307 = 0 of the system (3.1) is unstable.\nRemark 3.1. The inequality ns4 < s22 is equivalent with n\n\nn\nP\ni=1\n\n(\u03b1i2 )2 < (\n\nn\nP\n\ni=1\n\n\u03b1i2 )2 . Noticing that \u03b1i2 , i =\n\n1, 2, . . . , n, are the roots for the characteristic polynomial Q(\u03b1) = det(\u03b1In \u2212 M 2 ) we can apply the\ninequality (i) of Proposition 2.2 to the polynomial Q(\u03b1) = det(\u03b1In \u2212 M 2 ). We obtain\n||Ma2 ||2 > ||Ms2 ||2 \u2212\n\n1 2\nTr (Ms2 ).\nn\n\nAn elementary computation gives us that Ma2 = KC + CK and Ms2 = K 2 + C 2 . Consequently, the\ninequality (ii) of Theorem 3.1 is equivalent with\n1\n(||K||2 \u2212 ||C||2 )2 . 4\nn\nThe inequalities s2 < 0 or s4 < 0 obviously imply the existence of at least one complex eigenvalue\nwith non-zero imaginary part. As a consequence, we obtain the following sufficient conditions for\ninstability:\n||CK + KC||2 > ||K 2 + C 2 ||2 \u2212\n\nCorollary 3.2. If one of the following inequalities hold\n(i) ||K|| < ||C||;\n(ii) ||K 2 ||2 + ||C 2 ||2 + 2 Tr((KC)2 ) < 4||KC||2 ,\nthen the equilibrium point q = 0, q\u0307 = 0 of the system (3.1) is unstable.\nOther sufficient instability conditions for circulatory systems can also be found in [5], [6].\nFor n = 2, if Tr(K) 6= 0, then the inequalities (i) and (ii) from the above theorem are equivalent.\nFor n \u2265 3 the conditions (i), and (ii) and (iii) give different instability regions, as the following example\nshows. Let\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n1 0 0\n0 c 0\nK = \uf8f0 0 1 k \uf8fb ; C = \uf8f0 \u2212c 0 0 \uf8fb .\n0 k 0\n0 0 0\nCondition (i) is equivalent with the inequality 3c2 \u2212 3k 2 \u2212 1 > 0, condition (ii) is equivalent with the\ninequality \u2212(c2 \u2212 k 2 )2 + 14c2 \u2212 2k 2 \u2212 1 > 0 and condition (iii) is equivalent with 4c6 \u2212 4k 6 \u2212 12c2 k 2 (c2 \u2212\nk 2 ) + 8c4 \u2212 3k 4 + 4c2 k 2 + 4c2 > 0. The Figure 1 below shows the three instability regions corresponding\nto conditions (i), (ii), respectively (iii).\n\nFigure 1: Instability regions using Theorem 3.1: the horizontal grid designates the instability region obtained with\ncondition (i); the right-inclined grid designates the instability region obtained with condition (ii); the left-inclined grid\ndesignates the instability region obtained with condition (iii).\nThe above example shows that conditions (ii) and (iii) provide two supplementary instability regions\nthat cannot be determined by using condition (i).\n5\n\n\f4\n\nInstability for gyroscopic conservative systems\n\nNext, we will give sufficient conditions of instability for a mechanical system subject to gyroscopic forces\nand potential forces\nq\u0308 + Gq\u0307 + Kq = 0,\n(4.1)\nwhere G is skew-symmetric and describes the gyroscopic forces and K is symmetric and describes the\npotential forces. Various results concerning the stability problem for gyroscopic conservative systems\ncan be found in [7], [8], [9], [10].\nThe matrix associated with the linear system (4.1) is given by\n\u0014\n\u0015\nOn\nIn\nA=\n\u2212K \u2212G\nand its characteristic equation is P (\u03bb) := det(\u03bb2 In + \u03bbG + K) = 0. Using the skew-symmetry of G and\nthe symmetry of K we obtain that if \u03bb is a root of the characteristic equation, then \u2212\u03bb is also a root of\nthe characteristic equation. It follows that the above characteristic polynomial contains only powers of\n\u03bb2 . After the substitution \u03bb2 = \u03b1 we obtained the reduced polynomial Q(\u03b1). We will apply Proposition\n2.2 and Proposition 2.3 for the polynomial Q(\u03b1) in order to obtain sufficient conditions for the existence\nof complex roots with non-zero imaginary part. Thus, we get sufficient conditions for instability of the\nequilibrium point q = 0, q\u0307 = 0 of the linear system (4.1).\nP\nWe denote by sQ\nk the power sums of the roots of the polynomial Q(\u03b1). We also denote by sk the\nQ\npower sums of the roots for the characteristic polynomial P (\u03bb). The following equalities hold sP\n2 = 2s1\nQ\nand sP\n4 = 2s2 . Consequently, the condition (i) of Proposition 2.2 applied to the polynomial Q(\u03b1),\nQ\nQ 2\nP 2\nns2 < (s1 ) is equivalent with 2nsP\n4 < (s2 ) , which is also the condition (ii) of the same proposition\nQ 2\napplied to the polynomial P (\u03bb). The inequality nsQ\n2 < (s1 ) implies that the polynomial Q(\u03b1) has at\nP 2\nleast one complex root with non-zero imaginary part and thus inequality 2nsP\n4 < (s2 ) implies that the\npolynomial P (\u03bb) has at least one root with strictly positive real part, which guarantees the instability\nof (4.1).\n2\nP\n4\nAs before, sP\n2 = Tr(A ) and s4 = Tr(A ). We have the following computations\nAs =\n\n1\n(A + AT ) =\n2\n\n\u0014\n\nOn\n1\n(I\n\u2212 K)\nn\n2\n\n1\n2 (In\n\n\u2212 K)\nOn\n\n\u0015\n;\n\nAa =\n\n1\n(A \u2212 AT ) =\n2\n\n\u0014\n\nOn\n\u2212 21 (In + K)\n\n1\n2 (In\n\n+ K)\n\u2212G\n\nWe denote by B1 := 21 (In \u2212 K), B2 := 12 (In + K).

If the following inequality holds\n2n(2||K||2 + ||G2 ||2 + 4 Tr(GT KG)) < (2 Tr(K) + ||G||2 )2 ,\nthen the equilibrium point q = 0, q\u0307 = 0 of the system (4.1) is unstable.\nFor n = 3 we will study the instability for the classical example of a charged particle in a stationary\nelectromagnetic field. The particle is acted by the Lorentz force FL = qE(x) + q \u1e8b \u00d7 B(x), where q\nis the electric charge of the particle, E(x) is the electric field, B(x) is the magnetic field and x is the\nposition of the particle. From the stationarity assumption and Maxwell-Faraday equation we have that\nq\nq\n\u1e8b\u00d7B(x),\n\u2207\u03c6(x)+ m\nE(x) = \u2207\u03c6(x), where \u03c6(x) is the electric potential. The equation of motion is \u1e8d = m\nwhere m is the mass of the particle. At an equilibrium point (xe , 0) we have that \u2207\u03c6(xe ) = 0 and the\nlinearized equation at this equilibrium point is\nq\nq\n\u00ff =\nHess \u03c6(xe )y + B\u0302(xe )\u1e8f,\n(4.2)\nm\nm\nwhere B\u0302(xe ) is the constant skew-symmetric 3 \u00d7 3 matrix associated to the constant vector B(xe ). By\nq\na convenient choice of coordinates the matrix B\u0302(xe ) can be rendered in the canonical form\nm\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n0 \u2212c 0\nq\nB\u0302(xe ) = \uf8f0 c 0 0 \uf8fb .\nm\n0 0 0\n\u03b5\nq\nB\u0302(xe ) and\nWe consider the potential function \u03c6(x) = x21 + \u03b5x2 x3 . Making the notations G = \u2212 m\n2\nq\nK = \u2212 m Hess \u03c6(xe ), the equation (4.2) is in the form (4.1), where\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\n\uf8ee\n\uf8f9\nk 0 0\n0 c 0\nK = \uf8f0 0 0 k \uf8fb ; G = \uf8f0 \u2212c 0 0 \uf8fb ,\n0 0 0\n0 k 0\n6\n2\n4\n2 2\n3\nwith k = \u2212 \u03b5q\nm and c, k 6= 0. The characteristic polynomial is P (\u03bb) = \u03bb + (c + k)\u03bb \u2212 k \u03bb \u2212 k . After\n2\n3\n2\n2\n2\n3\nsubstitution \u03bb = \u03b1, the reduced polynomial becomes Q(\u03b1) = \u03b1 + (c + k)\u03b1 \u2212 k \u03b1 \u2212 k . Condition\n(i) of Proposition 2.3 applied for the polynomial Q(\u03b1) is equivalent with the condition from Theorem\n4.1 and gives the inequality \u2212(c2 + k)2 \u2212 3k 2 > 0. This inequality does not give an instability region.\nCondition (ii) of Proposition 2.3 applied for the polynomial Q(\u03b1) is equivalent with the inequality\nc6 + 4c4 k + 10c2 k 2 + 6k 3 < 0 and condition (iii) of Proposition 2.3 applied for the polynomial Q(\u03b1) is\nequivalent with the inequalities k < 0 and 2c6 + 7c4 k + 18c2 k 2 + 8k 3 > 0. The Figure 2 below shows\nthe two instability regions corresponding to conditions (ii) and (iii) of Proposition 2.3 applied to the\npolynomial Q(\u03b1).\nFor n = 2 the characteristic polynomial can be expressed in terms of traces and determinants of the\nmatrices which appear in the normal form (1.3). The study of the instability region (when the matrices\nD and C are also present) has been completely solved in [12], [13], using a result from [14].\n\n7\n\n\fFigure 2: Instability regions using Proposition 2.3: the right-inclined grid designates the instability region obtained with\ncondition (ii); the left-inclined grid designates the instability region obtained with condition (iii).\n\n5\n\nConclusions\n\nIn this paper we have used the Gramian technique for obtaining sufficient conditions for the existence\nof at least one complex root with non-zero imaginary part for a polynomial. Applying these results\nwe have obtained sufficient instability conditions for circulatory systems and gyroscopic conservative\nsystems. In this way, we recover the main theorems in [3] and [11]. Using other Gramians of second or\nhigher order, one can obtain similar sufficient instability conditions. Gramians have also been used in\nstudying the geometry of a higher order dissipation [15].\nAcknowledgements.
