In the case of charge and\ndisplacement sensors such as single-electron transistors\n(SETs) these fluctuations are related both to the sensors'\nultimate sensitivity and to their backaction on an object\nunder measurement [2, 3]. In such cases, one is primarily interested in the noise not near dc, but at frequencies\non the order of 1\u2013100 GHz. In this regime, when the\nphoton energy becomes comparable to the energy scale\nof the temperature kB T or bias voltage eVsd , it becomes\nimportant to consider the noise from a quantum perspective [4]; specifically, one must account for the fact that\nquantum systems can either emit or absorb energy by\nconsidering\nthe unsymmetrized quantum noise spectrum\nR +\u221e\nSI (\u03c9) = \u2212\u221e dtei\u03c9t hI(t)I(0)i of the current. In such a\ntreatment, negative frequencies correspond to emission,\nand positive frequencies to absorption.\nRecently there has been increased theoretical recognition of the importance of such an approach for nanoscale\nsystems [5, 6, 7] and measurements of high frequency\nnoise in Cooper pair boxes [8], Josephson junctions\n[9], superconducting SETs in the Cooper pair tunneling regime [10] and quantum point contacts [11] have\nbeen performed. Other measurements have focused on\nthe backaction of a detector such as an S-SET [12] or\natomic point contact [13] on a nanomechanical resonator.\nHere, we report complete and quantitative measurements\nof the quantum noise of an S-SET in the vicinity of the\ndouble Josephson-quasiparticle (DJQP) transport cycle,\nwhich involves tunneling of both Cooper pairs and quasiparticles [14]. The DJQP cycle has drawn recent interest\ndue to the interesting noise properties associated with\nsuch resonances [15], and because an S-SET biased near\nit is expected to approach the quantum limit for charge\ndetection [16]. The DJQP cycle has also been the focus\nof an effective bath description of the quantum noise and\nbackaction of mesoscopic electrical detectors [2].\nMeasurements were performed on Al/AlOx S-SETs\n\nfabricated on a GaAs substrate. Each S-SET was embedded in an on-chip superconducting microwave resonator\nconsisting of a spiral chip inductor L and parasitic capacitance Cp as shown in Fig. 1(a); such nearly dissipationless resonators [17] enable improved transfer of quantum\nnoise power out of the S-SET, making our measurements\npossible. The samples were placed in a 3 He refrigerator\nwith a base temperature of 290 mK. A bias-tee attached\nthe samples to both low frequency wiring and, via coaxial\nlines and a directional coupler, to a circulator and cryogenic HEMT amplifier, both at a temperature of 2.9 K.\nAt room temperature, the HEMT output was further\namplified, allowing either noise measurements or radiofrequency operation (RF-SET) [18]. The circulator isolated the sample from the HEMT amplifier, simplifying\nlater analysis [19]. The resonator is characterized by its\n\u22121\n\u22121\nloaded p\nQ-factor QT given by Q\u22121\nT = Q0 + QSET where\nQ0 =\nL/Cp /Z0 is the external Q of the resonator,\np\nZ0 = 50\u03a9 is the feedline impedance, QSET = Cp /L/Gd\nis the Q of the S-SET, and Gd is its differential\np conductance. At the resonant frequency \u03c90 = 1/ LCp the\nreflection coefficient \u0393in for rf signals incident on the\nG L/C \u2212Z\nresonator is given by \u0393in = Gdd L/Cpp +Z00 . Because the\nLC circuit is essentially dissipationless, its damping is\ndetermined by coupling to the feedline and the S-SET\ndifferential conductance Gd . The simple expressions for\nQT , QSET , and \u0393in above therefore allow us to determine\nL \u2248 167 nH and Cp \u2248 0.14 pF following the procedures\nin Ref. 17, with Q0 = 22 and f0 = \u03c90 /2\u03c0 = 1.04 GHz.\nTo characterize the HEMT amplifier and circulator, we\napplied a dc current I to the SET and measured the noise\npower Pn at \u03c90 in a bandwidth \u2206f = 5 MHz at the output of the amplifier chain, as shown in Fig. 1(d). Here\nPn = A(kB THEMT + |\u0393in |2 kB Tcirc + PSET (I))\u2206f where\nTHEMT and Tcirc are the HEMT and circulator noise temperatures, respectively, and PSET (I) is the spectral noise\ndensity of the SET [19, 20] referred to the HEMT input.\nThe total gain A = 61 dB of the amplifier chain is de-\n\n\f2\ntermined from the slope of the linear part of Pn versus\nI, while THEMT = 9.5 K (which dominates the amplifier\nnoise) was determined from the intersection of the linear\nasymptotes. (The circulator's contribution to this measurement was negligible, since |\u0393in |2 \u001c 1 for large I.)\nTcirc \u2248 2.9 K was found by measuring Pn at I = 0 and\nsubtracting the HEMT contribution, in excellent agreement with the circulator's physical temperature.\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\nHEMT\namplifier\n500\u03bcm\n\n500nm\n\nTo=o0.3oK\nZo\n+\n\u2012\n\nVrf\n\nL\nC\u03c0\n\nVsd\nvac\n\nC\u00a9\nSET\n\nP\u00f1oo (nW)\n\nVino=ovaco+oVsdo+Vrfo cosowt\n\nBias-tee\n\n+\n\nV\u00a9\nV\u03bc\n\n\u2012\n\n1.5\n1.4\n\n(d)\n\n1.3\n\n(b)\n\n(a)\n\n1.1\n\n1.5\n\n1.0\n-80\n\n20\n\n100\n\n1.2\n\n-40\n\n0\n40\nIoo (nA)\n\n75\n\n80\n\n1\n0\u21d42\n\nDJQP\n\n50\n\n0.5\n1\u21d4\u20121\n\n0\n0.0\n\n25\n\n-40\n\n0\n0\n\n\u22120.5\n\n0.4\n0.8\nVsdo(mV)\n\n(c)\n\n-60\n-80\n\n\u22121\n\nWe measured five S-SETs, finding similar charge sensitivity \u03b4q and PSET (I) for all of them and present results\nfor one, which was fabricated with an ultrathin (7 nm)\nisland (as were two others) [21], giving it a larger superconducting gap (\u2206i = 240 \u03bceV) than that of the thicker\nleads (\u2206l = 190 \u03bceV).

Gd was 2e periodic\nin ng , showing a supercurrent at ng = 0, 2, .... Features\ndue to the DJQP cycle [16, 23] (illustrated schematically\nin Fig. 2(d)), occur near the intersection two Cooper pair\nresonances, one for each junction in the S-SET. In the\nvicinity of the DJQP cycle the S-SET's quantum noise\nproperties are expected to depend strongly on the SET\nbias in Vsd and ng with respect to this intersection [2, 16],\nwhich is manifested by a peak in the S-SET current at\nVsd = 2Ec /e as in Fig. 2(b). Here Ec = e2 /2C\u03a3 is the\nS-SET charging energy, C\u03a3 = C1 + C2 + Cg is its total capacitance and C1(2) are the junction capacitances.\nThe DJQP peak location gave Ec = 237 \u03bceV, while fitting Cooper pair resonance lines to the data in Fig. 2(a)\n[23] allowed us to determine C1(2) = 174 (160) aF and\n\n10\n\nG\u2202oo(mS)\n\nFIG. 1: (a) Measurement circuit, showing the sample, biastee, circulator and HEMT amplifier.

These regions are associated with\nCooper pair resonances, occurring on the high-bias side\nof both the supercurrent and DJQP features; NDC near\nthe DJQP is visible in Fig. 2(b) as decreasing current\nwith increasing bias just past the current maximum. In\nterms of the simple picture of resonator damping given\nabove, if Gd < 0 we expect both QSET < 0 and |\u0393in | > 1.\nIn physical terms the SET is expected to exhibit negative\ndamping: rather than absorb energy from the resonator,\nthe SET should emit energy into it.\n\n(d)\n\n\u22121\n\n+V\nn\u21d4n\u20122\n\n0\nVsdo(mV)\n+V\n\n\u22125\n\n1\n\n\u007f\n\nn\u20122\u2192n\u20121\n\n1.0396\n+V\nn\u20121\u21d4n+1\n\n1.0400\nfoo(GHz)\n+V \u007f\n\n1.0404\n\nn+1\u2192n\n\nFIG. 2: (a) Gd for the S-SET versus Vsd and ng .

The Cooper pair\ntransition n \u2212 1 \u21d4 n + 1 is then resonant across the second\njunction until quasiparticle tunneling n + 1 \u2192 n across the\nfirst completes the cycle.\n\nThe regions of NDC have special significance for the\nS-SET's quantum noise properties. In the vicinity of the\nDJQP cycle, if the S-SET is biased below (above) both\nCooper pair resonances, the S-SET must absorb (emit)\nenergy for transport to occur; we refer to the S-SET being\nred (blue) detuned with respect to the DJQP cycle. Since\nthe S-SETs electromagnetic environment is dominated by\nthe LC resonator, most absorption (emission) will take\nthe form of photon exchange with the tank circuit [24].\n\n\f3\nGiven this asymmetry with respect to emission and absorption, a quantum noise description of the S-SET is\nappropriate. Furthermore, since there is a large disparity in time scales between the S-SET tunneling rates (10s\nof GHz) and the inverse response time of the resonator\n(f0 /QT \u2248 50 MHz) we use an effective temperature description [2, 3] in which the quantum noise of the S-SET\nat \u03c90 is given by\nSI (\u03c90 ) + SI (\u2212\u03c90 ) = 4kB TSET Cp \u03b3SET\n\n(1)\n\nSI (\u03c90 ) \u2212 SI (\u2212\u03c90 ) = 2~\u03c90 Cp \u03b3SET .\n\n(2)\n\nHere, the S-SET is treated as a quantum resistor with\nconductance Gd and effective temperature TSET , a measure of the asymmetry of its quantum noise at \u03c90 , while\n\u03b3SET = Gd /Cp is the rate at which it damps the electromagnetic modes of the resonator [5].

Cooper pair resonances\nare shown by the dashed lines, and the center of the DJQP occurs at their intersection. Noise is maximal for blue detuning\nand minimal for red detuning. (b) |\u0393in |(Vsd , ng ) at 300mK. A\nsmall region for which |\u0393in | > 1 exists for blue detuning. (c)\nAt 900mK PSET (Vsd , ng ) is smaller in the blue detuned region\n(in agreement with a lessening of NDC there for higher temperature). The reduction of PSET in the red-detuned region is\nmore pronounced, and tracks nearly exactly the Cooper pair\nresonance lines. (d) Gd (Vsd , ng ) at 300 mK. The region of\nNDC corresponds nearly exactly to that for which |\u0393in | > 1.\n\nWe measured the integrated SET noise PSET =\nPSET \u2206f , referred to the input of the HEMT at a given\nVsd and ng by subtracting the contributions due to the\nHEMT and circulator. PSET (Vsd , ng ) at 300 mK in the\nvicinity of the DJQP resonance is shown in Fig. 3(a) on a\nlogarithmic scale. The noise is minimal for red detuning\n\nwith respect to the DJQP, and maximal for blue detuning. We can tie these noise characteristics to emission\nand absorption in the S-SET by measuring the reflection coefficient |\u0393in | of the tank circuit over the same\nrange of Vsd and ng , as in Fig. 3(b). We applied a very\nsmall carrier wave (\u2212149 dBm), measured the reflected\npower, and after accounting for the HEMT and circulator, computed \u0393in . For most values of Vsd and ng , we\nfound |\u0393in | < 1, indicating net absorption by the S-SET.\nHowever, when the S-SET is blue detuned, there was a\nregion for which |\u0393in | > 1, indicating emission. Here the\nS-SET provides negative damping, returning more power\nto the resonator than is delivered by the rf excitation.\nComparing with the S-SET conductance in the same region as shown in Fig. 3(d), we see that the region of\nnegative damping corresponds exactly to the region of\nNDC, in accord with both our expectation based on the\nforms of QSET and \u0393in , and with the more sophisticated\nquantum noise viewpoint of (1) and (2). In Fig. 3(c), we\nshow PSET at 900 mK; the general features apparent in\nFig. 3(a) are still visible.\nGiven the excellent correspondence between |\u0393in | and\nGd found in our earlier work [17] and Fig. 3, we proceed to\nuse TSET and \u03b3SET to describe the S-SET quantum noise.\nWe treat the S-SET as a source with available noise power\nkB TSET of which some portion |\u0393out |2 kB TSET is reflected\nby the resonator while the remainder Kout kB TSET is delivered to the HEMT. It can be shown that PSET =\nKout kB TSET \u2206f = 4Q2T Z0 Gd kB TSET \u2206f , so that TSET\ncan be found from measurements of PSET , while \u03b3SET\ncan be determined directly from Gd via the relation\n\u03b3SET = Gd /Cp . The resulting values of \u03b3SET and TSET\nnear the DJQP for 300 mK are shown in Fig. 4(a) and\n(b), respectively, providing a complete and quantitative\nmeasurement of the S-SET quantum noise at \u03c90 . The\ntendency of the S-SET to either emit or absorb (as measured by \u03b3SET ) and its degree of asymmetry (as measured\n(\u03c90 )+SI (\u2212\u03c90 )\n) vary strongly with Vsd and ng .\nby TSET \u221d SSII (\u03c9\n0 )\u2212SI (\u2212\u03c90 )\nFor blue detuning (Cooper pairs must give off energy) we\nobserve both negative damping and a negative effective\ntemperature. While TSET is large in some areas, for most\nbias points TSET . 1K (making it smaller than eVsd /kB ).\nFor red detuning TSET can be as low as TSET \u2248 100 mK,\nless than the ambient temperature. While theoretical expressions for \u03b3SET and TSET near the DJQP exist [2], they\nassume capacitive coupling of the S-SET to a resonator\nrather than our direct electrical connection, and also ignore higher order tunneling processes known [12, 23] to\nbe important for our relatively low-resistance S-SETs.\nAdditional theoretical work is required for a direct comparison with our experimental results. Finally, we prefer\nTSET and \u03b3SET as a description of the S-SET quantum\nnoise over the Fano factor since the latter is due only to\nfluctuations of the number of tunneling electrons [15]. In\nour experiment, variations in PSET arising from electron\n\n\f4\nnumber fluctuations are indistinguishable from those due\nto emission/absorption of photons.\n30\n1\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\n600\n0\u21d42\n\n0\u21d42\n20\n\nn\u00a9\n0.5\n\n10\n\n200\n0\n1\u21d4\u20121\n\nTSETo(K)\n\ngSET (MHz)\n\n400\n\n0\n\n1\u21d4\u20121\n\n0\n0.3\n\n0.5\n0.7\nVsdo(mV)\n\n0.9\n\n\u221235\n\n0.3\n\n0.5\n0.7\nVsdo(mV)\n\n0.9\n\n\u2212100\n\ninteresting area for future investigation, as could be the\npossibility of producing laser-like instabilities [27] if the\ntotal quality factor QT , as opposed to just the S-SET\nquality factor QSET , can be made negative.\nThis work was supported by the ARO under Agreement No. W911NF-06-1-0312, by the NSF under Grant\nNo. DMR-0454914 and by the NSA, LPS and ARO\nunder Agreement No. W911NF-04-1-0389.

Together, these give a complete and\nquantitative description of the S-SET quantum noise.\n\u2217\n\nGiven interest in use of the RF-SET as a potentially\nquantum limited electrical amplifier [16, 25] it is worthwhile to estimate our proximity to this limit. The uncoupled energy sensitivity \u03b4\u03b5 = (\u03b4q)2 /2C\u03a3 (\u03b4\u03b5 \u2248 1.04~\nfor our sample) is frequently used as such an estimate.\nHowever, \u03b4\u03b5 does not have a lower bound [25], as a rigorous estimate should. A better estimate can be obtained when knowledge of both TSET and \u03b3SET is available. We imagine coupling the S-SET to some external device\np such as a quantum dot. Then the parameter \u03c7 = 4(Eint /e)2 SQ SI /(~\u2206I)2 obeys a strict quantum limit \u03c7 > 1, where SQ is the spectral density of\ncharge fluctuations on the S-SET island, Eint describes\nits interaction with the measured system, and \u2206I is the\nchange in S-SET current corresponding to a change in\nthe system charge state [26]; \u03c72 is the ratio of the time it\ntakes the S-SET to measure a charge state to the time it\ntakes to dephase it. Using the voltage fluctuations across\nthe S-SET to estimate SQ \u2248 41 kB TSET C\u03a32 /Gd we find\np\n\u03c7 \u2248 2kB TSET (\u03b4q/e)2 /Gd ~2 independent of the details\nof the measured system or its coupling to the S-SET. For\ntypical values TSET \u2248 0.7 K and Gd \u2248 20 \u03bcS, and using\nour measured \u03b4q, we find \u03c7 \u2248 2.5, so that our RF-SET\noperates in the vicinity of the quantum limit.\nIn conclusion, we have directly measured the quantum\nnoise of an S-SET in the vicinity of the DJQP cycle.\nWe find that the damping of the resonator in which the\nS-SET is embedded is directly determined by its conductance Gd , allowing us to determine when absorption or\nemission dominates the quantum noise. Combining measurements of damping with measurements of total noise\nPSET from the S-SET allows us to determine its effective temperature TSET , which can be viewed as a measure of the asymmetry of its quantum noise. TSET and\nthe damping \u03b3SET provide a complete and quantitative\ndescription of the quantum noise in the vicinity of the\nDJQP cycle. Our measurement technique is very similar\nto those proposed for measurement of zero-point fluctuations [5, 7]. Such measurements, if performed at lower\ntemperatures and possibly higher frequency, could be an\n\n\u2020\n\n[1]\n[2]\n\n[3]\n[4]\n[5]\n[6]\n[7]\n[8]\n[9]\n[10]\n[11]\n[12]\n[13]\n[14]\n\n[15]\n[16]\n[17]\n[18]\n[19]\n[20]\n[21]\n[22]\n[23]\n[24]\n[25]\n\nThese authors made equal contributions to this work.\nElectronic address: ajrimberg@dartmouth.edu\nYa.
