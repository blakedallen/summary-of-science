Zero-field measurements indicate no\nstatic magnetic fields developing below the transition temperature.\nPACS numbers: 74.70.Dd, 74.60.-w, 76.75.+i\n\nThe pyrochlore transition metal oxides, of general formula A2 B2 O7 , have been the topic of much interest in\nrecent years as they represent ideal systems for studying the effects of geometrical frustration [1]. Both the A\nand B sublattices form a network of corner-sharing tetrahedra such that it may not be possible to energetically\nsatisfy all the magnetic interactions simultaneously. The\nresultant geometric frustration leads to the formation of\nexotic ground states. Much of the recent work has concentrated on local moment systems where novel properties such as cooperative paramagnetism [2], partial, noncollinear antiferromagnetic ordering [3, 4], spin-freezing\n[5], and dipolar \"spin-ice\" behavior [6, 7] have been observed. There has, however, been growing interest in the\ninterplay between itinerant and local moments in geometrically frustrated systems. The metallic pyrochlore\nNd2 Mo2 O7 exhibits a large anomalous Hall effect which\nhas been attributed to the Berry phase produced by spin\nchirality on the pyrochlore lattice [8], while the spinel\ncompound, LiV2 O4 has been claimed to represent the\nfirst known transition metal heavy-fermion system and\nevidence exists that the unusual properties of this material are related to geometrical frustration on the spinel\nlattice. [9]\nA vast body of work has been carried out on 3d and\n4d transition metal pyrochlores. These are generally insulators and possess either a spin-glass-like or long-range\nordered magnetic structure. In contrast, the 5d transition\nmetal pyrochlores are mainly metallic, resulting from the\nextended nature of the 5d orbitals. The exception to this\nis Cd2 Os2 O7 [10] where the 5d3 configuration of Os5+\n\nresults in a half-filled t2g band and a metal-insulator\ntransition at 226 K. Despite the large number of transition metal compounds which crystallize in the pyrochlore\nstructure and the wide range of physical phenomena observed in these materials, superconductivity had not been\nobserved until the recent discovery of bulk superconductivity in the 5d pyrochlore, Cd2 Re2 O7 [11, 12].\nCd2 Re2 O7 crystallizes in the pyrochlore structure with\nroom temperature lattice constant a=10.219 \u00c5 and an\noxygen positional parameter x=0.3089.[13] Recent investigations [11, 12, 14, 15, 16] have demonstrated the existence of two phase transitions in this compound. The\nfirst, occurring at a temperature of about 200 K, is a\ncontinuous structural transition which is accompanied\nby drastic changes in resistivity and magnetic susceptibility [15, 16]. On further lowering the temperature,\nCd2 Re2 O7 has been shown to exhibit bulk superconductivity below a sample dependent transition temperature\nof about 1 K [11, 12, 14]. Preliminary measurements in\nthe superconducting state indicate that Cd2 Re2 O7 is a\ntype-II superconductor with Hc1 less than 0.002 T and\nestimates of the upper critical field, Hc2 , ranging from\n0.2 T to 1 T [11, 12, 14]. None of the measurements\nreported to date extend below 0.3 K (T /Tc \u223c0.3) and\nhence, little can be concluded about the symmetry of the\norder parameter in this system. An exponential form of\nthe specific heat as T approaches zero was speculated by\nHanawa et al. [12] but they point out that measurements\nto lower temperatures are clearly needed. We report the\nfirst measurements on Cd2 Re2 O7 below 300 mK, temperatures which are necessary (for Tc \u223c 1 K) to extract\n\n\f2\ninformation about the superconducting order parameter\nsymmetry. We have performed transverse field (TF) and\nzero field (ZF) muon spin rotation (\u03bcSR) measurements\non single crystal samples of Cd2 Re2 O7 . The ZF-\u03bcSR\nmeasurements reveal very small internal magnetic fields\nwhich are characteristic of nuclear dipoles, indicating no\nsignificant electronic magnetism either above or below\nTc . The TF-\u03bcSR results provide the first measurement\nof the internal field distribution in the vortex state in this\nmaterial. In particular, temperature dependent studies\nfrom 20 mK to 4 K indicate a penetration depth which\nlevels off as T \u2192 0, suggestive of a fully gapped Fermi\nsurface with a rather large zero temperature value of the\npenetration depth, \u03bb(0)\u223c7500 \u00c5.\nMuon spin rotation has proven to be a very effective\nprobe in the study of superconductivity [17]. In particular, TF-\u03bcSR provides a measure of the length scales\nassociated with type-II superconductors, the penetration\ndepth, \u03bb and the vortex core radius r0 [17]. In a TF-\u03bcSR\nexperiment, spin polarized muons, with polarization perpendicular to the applied magnetic field direction, are\nimplanted in a sample at a location which is random on\nthe length scale of the vortex lattice. The muon precesses\nat a rate proportional to the local magnetic field providing a measure of the local field distribution, n(B). The\npresence of the vortex lattice results in a spatially inhomogeneous field distribution and a resulting muon spin\ndepolarization.\nEarly TF-\u03bcSR measurements assumed a Gaussian distribution of magnetic fields and with this approximation,\nthe penetration depth can be directly obtained from the\nGaussian depolarization rate, \u03c3 \u223c 1/\u03bb2 . This approximation has been shown to be reasonable for the case\nof polycrystalline samples but is inadequate for the case\nof single crystals [17]. In this case, a Ginzburg-Landau\n(GL) model has been developed to model the magnetic\nfield distribution for a single crystal. In GL theory, the\nsize of the vortex core is determined by the applied magnetic field, H, and the GL coherence length normal to the\napplied field, \u03beGL , while the penetration depth provides\nthe length scale of the decay of magnetic field away from\nthe vortex core. The field distribution is calculated from\nthe spatial distribution of magnetic field [18],\nB(r) =\n\nX\nuK1 (u)\n\u03a60\n,\n(1 \u2212 b4 )\ne\u2212iG*r\nS\n1 + \u03bb2 G2\nG\n\n(1)\n\n2\nwhere u2 = 2\u03beGL\nG2 (1 + b4 )[1 \u2212 2b(1 \u2212 b2 )], K1 (u) is a\nmodified Bessel function, G is a reciprocal lattice vector\nof the vortex lattice, b = H/Hc2 is the reduced field, \u03a60\nis the flux quantum and S is the area of the reduced unit\ncell for a hexagonal vortex lattice.\nSingle crystals of Cd2 Re2 O7 were grown using vaportransport techniques as described elsewhere [14, 19].\nThree samples with an approximate surface area of 5\u00d75\nmm2 each were mounted using low temperature grease\n\nFIG. 1: Typical \u03bcSR spectra in Cd2 Re2 O7 obtained in a\ntransverse magnetic field of 0.007 T at temperatures of (a)\nT=1.5 K (above Tc ) and (b) T=100 mK (below Tc ).\n\nsuch that the cubic (100) direction would be parallel to\nthe applied magnetic field direction. They were mounted\non intrinsic GaAs in order to eliminate any precession signal at the background frequency [20] from muons which\nmiss the sample and would otherwise land in the Ag sample holder. The samples were covered with 0.025 mm Ag\nfoil which was bolted to the sample holder to ensure temperature uniformity. The TF and ZF-\u03bcSR measurements\nwere performed in an Oxford Instruments dilution refrigerator on the M15 beamline at TRIUMF at temperatures\nfrom 20 mK up to 4 K.\nGiven the estimated critical field values, we selected a\nfield value of 0.007 T and the temperature dependence\nwas measured by cooling the sample in the presence of\nthis applied magnetic field to ensure a uniform flux line\nlattice. Figs. 1(a) and (b) show typical \u03bcSR spectra in\na transverse field of 0.007 T, for temperatures above and\nbelow Tc respectively. Examination of this data clearly\nshows an enhanced depolarization rate on entering the\nsuperconducting state resulting from the inhomogeneous\nfield distribution associated with the flux line lattice.\nThis represents the first experimental observation of the\nvortex lattice in Cd2 Re2 O7 and provides clear evidence\n\n\f3\n\nFIG. 2: Linewidth parameter \u03c3 as a function of temperature\nin a transverse magnetic field of 0.007 T applied along the\n(100) direction. The solid line is a fit to Eq. 2.\n\nthat this material is a type-II superconductor. The observed increase in the TF line broadening below Tc can\nbe attributed entirely to the vortex lattice since the ZF\nmuon spin relaxation rate (not shown here) was small\nand roughly temperature independent below 2 K.\nThe solid lines shown in Figs. 1(a) and (b) represent\nfits of the individual time spectra to a sample signal consisting of a Gaussian envelope with fixed asymmetry and\na background signal with fixed linewidth and asymmetry. The background, from muons which miss the sample\nand land in the heat shields, was obtained independently\nby performing measurements with the sample removed.\nThe resulting sample linewidth, \u03c3, is shown in Fig. 2\nas a function of temperature. As one can clearly see,\nthe magnitude of the depolarization rate as T \u2192 0 is\nvery small, saturating at a value of about 0.1 \u03bcs\u22121 . The\nresidual linewidth from nuclear dipoles, taken from the\ndata above Tc , is very small in Cd2 Re2 O7 (about 0.03\n\u03bcs\u22121 ), allowing for clear observation of the line broadening associated with the flux line lattice. Apparently the\nmuons stop in sites which are not close to the Re ions,\nwhich have appreciable nuclear moments.\nAs can be seen from Eq. 1, the field distribution depends on both the penetration depth and GL coherence\ndepth. The GL coherence length can be obtained from\nthe known value of the upper critical field using the expression \u03beGL = (\u03a60 /2\u03c0Hc2 )1/2 where \u03a60 is the flux quantum. As mentioned above, a range of values for Hc2\nhave been reported and consequently, to provide a selfconsistent measurement of \u03bb, the field dependence of the\nlinewidth was measured. To account for any possible\ninstrumental field-dependence in the linewidth, measurements were made above the transition temperature (2\nK) at each field value after which the sample was fieldcooled to 100 mK. The measured linewidth in the normal state was subtracted in quadrature from that ob-\n\nFIG. 3: Linewidth parameter \u03c3F C as a function of magnetic\nfield applied along the (100) direction. The normal state contribution has been subtracted as described in the text. Measurements were taken at a temperature of 100 mK.\n\nserved at 100 mK and the results are plotted in Fig. 3\nas a function of applied magnetic field. As can be clearly\nseen, the linewidth decreases almost linearly with applied\nfield. This is attributed to the linear increase in the volume taken up by the vortices. The linewidth parameter,\n\u03c3F C , approaches zero at a field of 0.5 T which is our\nestimate of Hc2 (T\u21920) and is consistent with measurements on other samples. This estimate of the critical\nfield corresponds to \u03beGL \u223c 260 \u00c5. Using this value, we\nobtain the penetration depth using the field distribution\nshown in Eq. 1. The resulting temperature dependent\npenetration depth is shown in Fig. 4. As expected from\nthe small values of linewidth, at the base temperature\nwe observe a rather large value of the penetration depth,\n\u03bb(0) \u223c 7500\u00c5. We note that this value of penetration\ndepth is significantly larger than most oxide superconductors where values ranging from 1000-2000 \u00c5 are typical [21, 22].\nAs the penetration depth is related to the concentration of superconducting carriers, its temperature dependence is a measure of the low-lying electronic excitations.\nAs such, the presence of a nodeless superconducting energy gap is indicated by a leveling off of the penetration depth as the temperature decreases below Tc . As is\nclearly seen in Figs. 2 and 4, the linewidth and penetration depth respectively become temperature independent\nas the temperature decreases below about 0.4 K, consistent with a fully gapped Fermi surface. Consequently,\nwe conclude that the superconducting order parameter in\nCd2 Re2 O7 is consistent with a nodeless energy gap suggesting either s-wave symmetry or exotic pairing symmetries, such as p-wave which can also exhibit a fully gapped\nFermi surface. For comparison, the solid line in Figs. 2\n\n\f4\nplay a direct role in the superconductivity. Transversefield measurements show that Cd2 Re2 O7 is a type-II superconductor and indicate a superconducting order parameter consistent with a fully gapped Fermi surface\nwith a zero temperature value of penetration depth of\n\u223c7500 \u00c5. However, considering that the superconductor\nmay be in the dirty limit, spectroscopic techniques which\ndirectly measure the density of states would be required\nto confirm this conclusion.\n\nFIG. 4:\nPenetration depth as a function of temperature\nin a magnetic field of 0.007 T applied parallel to the (100)\ndirection.

There is considerable uncertainty in\nestimations of the mean-free path with reported values\nranging from 200-700 \u00c5[14, 23] and it is unclear whether\nCd2 Re2 O7 is a superconductor in the clean or dirty limit.\nIf the material is in the clean limit, the present results\nprovide strong evidence for a fully gapped Fermi surface.\nUnder the assumption of a clean superconductor, such\nthat \u03be0 /l \u226a 1, a value of ns me /m\u2217 of 5.0\u00d71025 m\u22123\ncan be obtained using Eq. 4 and the measured penetration depth. On the other hand, if l \u223c200 \u00c5 (i.e. the dirty\nlimit) then we obtain \u03be0 \u223c470 \u00c5 and ns me /m\u2217 \u223c1.4\u00d71026\nm\u22123 . Clearly, precise determination of the mean free\npath for Cd2 Re2 O7 is needed to allow accurate quantitative information to be extracted.\nIn conclusion, we have performed \u03bcSR studies of the\nsuperconducting state in the recently discovered pyrochlore superconductor, Cd2 Re2 O7 . Zero-field measurements indicate no significant magnetism in this superconductor, suggesting that magnetic frustration does not\n\n[1] for recent reviews see Magnetic Systems with Competing Interactions, edited by H.
