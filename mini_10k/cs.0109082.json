In essence, the paper finds that if current regulatory trends continue,\nasymmetries in the regulation of service-level competition will be on steroids by the time\nFTTH starts being more commonly deployed. This finding is especially problematic if\nfiber's high deployment costs and potential for integrated services lead to highly\nmonopolistic local access markets.\nWe view the high-level problem as a lack of clear regulatory commitment to service-level\ncompetition as a long-term policy goal, independent of the specific local access\ntechnology or the nature of the particular service(s) offered. Current regulatory\nrequirements are either non-existent, or extremely detailed and technology- and servicespecific (e.g. UNEs). We argue that neither of these approaches is likely to achieve the\ndesired result for FTTH, given the current state of flux in emerging FTTH technology.\n\nGillett & Tseng\n\n1\n\n\fIntroduction\nFiber to the Home (FTTH) describes a set of emerging technologies whose common\nelement is the deployment of a fiber-optic line all the way to the residential customer's\npremises. Although some of these technologies have been talked about for at least 10-20\nyears,1 the emergence of a significant market for residential Internet access has breathed\nnew life into the discussions. Practical interest in FTTH is resurgent, based on nowproven consumer demand for residential broadband Internet access, the continuing\ndevelopment and popularity of ever more bandwidth-hungry Internet applications such\npeer-to-peer file sharing and video distribution, and ongoing price-performance\nimprovements in optical networking technology. In the context of these trends, FTTH is\nviewed by many stakeholders as the soundest basis for a more future-proof local access\ninfrastructure.\nIn the second section of this paper, we explain why we see FTTH as the eventual future\nof residential broadband infrastructure, at least for fixed (wired) networks. We review\ncurrent experiments with FTTH in the U.S. and discuss the motivations of organizations\ncurrently or potentially deploying FTTH. These organizations include incumbent\ntelephone and cable operators, new entrants building alternative facilities, and\nmunicipalities, typically in the form of municipal utilities.\nThe likely emergence of FTTH networks makes it important to consider what effect they\nmay have on future local access competition. On the one hand, the high cost of\ndeploying fiber and associated equipment all the way to the residence suggests limitations\non the extent of facilities-based competition (Reed, 1991). As with today's residential\nbroadband Internet access, duopoly would be the best outcome, in communities in which\nboth cable and telephone networks migrate to FTTH. Monopoly is also a likely outcome,\nhowever, because FTTH can create a significant first mover advantage. Fiber's high\nbandwidth capacity means that one network operator can provide multiple services (e.g.\ndata, voice and video), leaving less room for entrants to offer novel services to attract\npotential customers. By this argument, the first network to migrate, or the first network\nto be built from scratch, precludes the ability of would-be competitors to recoup their\ninvestment in FTTH. 2\nOn the other hand, FTTH opens up new possibilities for service-level competition,\ndefined as the sharing of a single network infrastructure by multiple higher-layer service\nproviders, whether of the same or different services. Emerging FTTH technologies\npresent a degree of technical flexibility much greater than that of the legacy telephone\nand cable networks primarily used for broadband today. The high and ever-increasing\ntransmission capacity of fiber, and the lack of legacy allocations of that capacity in new\n\n1\n\nSee, for example, (Reed 1991) and the references therein.\nFiber need not run all the way to the home for a network operator to offer integrated services. However,\nan all-fiber network offers the greatest capacity and flexibility for combining multiple services.\n2\n\nGillett & Tseng\n\n2\n\n\fnetwork designs, mean that FTTH capacity can potentially be shared not just among\nmultiple users and services, but also among multiple service providers.3 For example,\ncustomers might buy Internet access from several different ISPs, all delivering service\nover the same FTTH network. Or, they might buy Internet access and video (e.g. cable\nTV) services over the same network, but from different companies. Yet another form of\nservice-level competition might arise if the data transmission capabilities delivered over\nFTTH are high enough to support new modes of usage, such as switched digital video4\nand video telephony, that indirectly compete with more traditional cable TV and\ntelephony services.\nYet technology is hardly an exogenous factor that independently shapes future local\naccess competition. The regulatory environment also plays a key role. By shaping\nexpectations about future competitive requirements, current regulations influence\nnetwork operators' deployment choices among competing FTTH technologies. At a\nmore basic level, regulatory expectations also shape design choices made by vendors and\nstandards bodies for technologies still under development. Thus current regulations\ninfluence how likely it is that FTTH's potential to support more service-level competition\nwill actually be realized.\nThe current regulatory approach to FTTH is far from consistent. Requirements for\nsupport of service-level competition vary tremendously depending on the type of service\n(voice, data or video) and the identity of the network operator. The third section of this\npaper reviews the details of this heterogeneity. The paper concludes with a discussion of\nwhy this inconsistent approach is problematic, and potential policy directions that could\nimprove this situation.\n\nFTTH: The Future of Residential Broadband\nDespite much hype, actual deployments of FTTH in the U.S. remain at the relatively rare\nstage, in which TPRC authors can still list a reasonable sample of trials in a short table\n(see Table 1).\n\n3\n4\n\nSee (Tseng 2001, Chapter 4) for further detail on this point.\nAlso known as Video ove r IP.

Existing network operators are pushing fiber ever closer to subscribers. In order\nto reduce maintenance costs, increase capacity and support new services such as\nbroadband Internet access, cable TV and telephony, cable and telephone network\noperators have been deploying more fiber and pushing it closer to the subscriber. For\nGillett & Tseng\n\n4\n\n\fexample, the Hybrid Fiber Coax (HFC) networks generally built out by cable\noperators in the mid-late 1990's typically brought fiber to a \"neighborhood\" (FTTN)\nof about 500-2,000 homes (Gillett, 1997). Recent overbuilders such as RCN typically\nbring fiber to the \"curb\" (FTTC), serving clusters of 20-200 homes. A logical result\nof this evolution is for fiber eventually to reach all the way to the customers'\npremises.\n2. Fiber may already be more economical than copper for greenfield sites. Because\na large portion of the costs of a new network lie in its installation, 5 in new\ndevelopments the cost differential to deploy fiber all the way to the end user may be\nnegligible. It may even be favorable when the comparison factors in life cycle\n(operational) costs, and/or the option that an all-fiber network grants by giving\nproviders more flexibility to meet the uncertainties of future demand. 6 The value of\nthis option can be realized with a variety of incremental strategies, including laying\nfiber to the end user premises but not making it visible to subscribers in the form of\nnew services, thereby reducing the cost of end-user equipment needed in advance of\nproven demand. Such strategies are also being adopted in areas where existing\nnetworks are being largely rebuilt as part of routine maintenance.\n3. Communications infrastructure is increasingly seen by communities as essential\nto their economic development. Demand for advanced telecommunications services\nis hardly limited to high-density urban communities, yet these are the areas where the\nmarket brings them soonest (Gillett and Lehr, 1999; Gabel and Kwan, 2000). More\nsparsely populated areas have come to view availability delays as a disadvantage that\nthreatens their ability to attract and retain businesses and residents. 7 In some cases,\nthis rationale has led communities to build their own local access network, just as\nthey assume responsibility for water, roads and other infrastructure. When the goal is\ncommunity economic development rather than profit, FTTH's advantages in\nproviding advanced services and future-proofing are especially appealing.\nThese trends are evident in Table 1. About half of the deployments listed target new\nhousing developments. Grant County, WA and Palo Alto, CA lead the trend toward\nmunicipally developed networks. 8\nOf additional interest in Table 1 are the different types of organizations involved in\ndeploying FTTH networks. Potential FTTH network providers include the incumbent\ncable and telephone operators as well as new entrants such as competitive local exchange\n\n5\n\nFTTH will primarily be deployed where the provider can avoid trenching-for example, in new builds,\nwhere trenches are already being dug for other utilities, and in areas where access to aerial plant is\navailable.\n6\n[*** Insert citation(s) here. ***]\n7\nSee, for example, the rationales for the various \"Connect\" projects to develop alternative broadband\ninfrastructure in New England. These projects are linked from http://www.mtpc.org, the web site of the\nMassachusetts Technology Collaborative.\n8\nA number of other municipalities have undertaken telecommunications infrastructure projects; these are\nthe only two communities we are aware of that have brought fiber all the way to the home. See (Strover\nand Berquist, 1999).\n\nGillett & Tseng\n\n5\n\n\fcarriers (CLECs), other competitive access providers, utilities and municipalities.\nMotivations and strategies for deployment vary greatly among the different providers and\ndeployment scenarios. The rest of this section reviews the trend toward FTTH within\neach of these categories.\n[* Following sections to be edited for consistency *]\n\nILEC\nTelephone companies have several motivations to replace the existing telephone\ninfrastructure with Fiber to the Home including lower maintenance costs and the ability\nto provide services such as very high speed data access and video that are not well\nsupported by the current telephone network. Also, as the old infrastructure needs repair,\ntelephone companies are incrementally replacing the copper wiring with fiber. However,\ncurrently advanced services are not offered even though the infrastructure may be\nupgraded to fiber, because of the high costs of replacing the customer equipment.\nA couple of ILECs have deployed FTTH trial networks. Bell South has a trial serving 400\nhomes in a suburb of Atlanta, and Verizon is running a FTTH trial in an undisclosed\nlocation on the East Coast.\n\nAlternative facility provider\nCompetitive providers have varying strategies and business models for the deployment of\nFiber to the Home networks. The different providers vary by the type of services they\nprovide. Some competitive providers provide only data services. These companies are\nknown as Competitive Access Providers.\nOther companies provide a full set of services over the network including telephone,\ncable TV, and sometimes, advanced services such as neighborhood Intranet and video on\ndemand. A CLEC is a provider that is licensed to provide telephone service, and is\nbound by the common carriage rules in the Telecommunications Act that apply to local\nexchange carriers outlined above.\nThese providers often target greenfield sites. For example, companies such as\nClearWorks.net and ViaLight offer voice, video and data services to new developments,\nteaming up with a real estate developer to provide the network to homes in a private\ndevelopment. Usually the developer gives them some kind of guarantee for the number\nof homes that will hook up to the network. In some cases, they may get exclusive rights\nfor a period of time. In this way they gain first mover advantage.\nCompanies known as overbuilders deploy networks in existing neighborhoods providing\na third wire into the home. Most of these companies are deploying HFC systems even\nthough network installation costs do not differ significantly whether they are deploying\ncoaxial cables or fiber. However, the total cost of Fiber to the Home is still too expensive\nfor most of these providers. FTTH will become more viable for overbuilders as\nequipment costs come down. One exception is Western Integrated Networks (WINFirst),\nGillett & Tseng\n\n6\n\n\fwhich has obtained cable licenses in various cities in Texas and California announced\nplans is to build a combined HFC and FTTH network where coaxial cable carries the\ntelevision signals and fiber carries data and voice into the home.\n\nRural/independent telco\nSome independent telephone companies in rural areas have adopted Fiber to the Home\ntechnology. For example, Rye Telephone Company in Colorado and Huntel Engineering\noffer cable TV, telephone and Internet access to their customers in new housing\ndevelopments. 9\n\nMunicipal utility\nUtilities (especially electric) are looking to broaden their business strategy into\ntelecommunications, especially since they often have much of the infrastructure already\nin place. In fact, many of these organizations have already deployed fiber networks\nconnecting their own facilities. Some lease dark fiber to other organizations and\nbusinesses. Some utilities want to build out their networks to individual homes and\nbusinesses to support applications such as automated metering. Since these applications\ndo not take much bandwidth, they can use these networks to offer telecommunications\nservices.\nUtilities have certain advantages over other potential competitive providers. For one\nthing, they already have staff with the expertise in the deployment and maintenance of\nfiber networks. They have access to the poles and rights-of-way. They have\nrelationships with existing customers and also have billing support systems in place.\nHowever, utilities lack experience in telecommunications, so they may partner with\nanother company to offer telecommunications services. For example, overbuilders may\npartner with electrical utilities in order to obtain rights-of-way. RCN's partnership with\nBoston Edison is an example of this type of partnership.\n\nIn order to stimulate competition, some local governments are directly investing in\ntelecommunications infrastructure, including local access networks. These municipalities\nform public/private partnerships to offer services over these facilities. These local\ngovernments are building competitive alternatives to the incumbent telephone and cable\nTV infrastructure.\nMunicipalities build telecommunications infrastructure for reasons beyond pure profit.\nMunicipalities upgrade telecommunications infrastructure with the hope of attracting\nresidents and businesses to their communities by offering access to advanced\ntelecommunications services. Some municipalities, especially in rural communities, lack\nadvanced services and feel they cannot rely on the private sector to provide them. These\n9\n\nHuntel Engineering http://www.huntelengineering.com and Rye Telephone Company http://\nwww.fone.net/soco/guide/colocity/rtc/home.html\n\nGillett & Tseng\n\n7\n\n\fcommunities have a vested interest providing choice for their citizens, and therefore are\ninterested in promoting service level competition over their networks.\nCertain municipalities -- such as Grant County, Washington and Palo Alto, California-\nare deploying Fiber to the Home networks in their communities, extending existing\npublicly owned networks into the local loop themselves and partner with private\ncompanies to provide the services.\n\nIncumbent cable operators\nCable television providers have shown less interest than the incumbent telephone\ncompanies to deploy fiber all the way to the home. Cable television companies are taking\na gradual approach to deploying fiber closer to the subscriber. Cable companies such as\nAT&T are migrating their HFC systems to Fiber to the Curb to allow fewer subscribers to\nshare the network. Eventually, cable companies may migrate to all fiber networks if\napplication demand warrants it (especially for upstream bandwidth), if incrementally\nupgrading the network becomes more expensive than deploying fiber all the way, or if\nFTTH offers significant enough savings in operational costs compared with HFC\nnetworks.\n\nU.S. Regulatory Requirements for Service-Level Competition\nThe current regulatory approach to service-level competition is far from consistent,\nvarying by the type of provider and the types of services they offer (Table 2).\n\nGillett & Tseng\n\n8\n\n\fTable 2: U.S. Requirements for support of service-level competition\nVoice\n\nType of\nProvider\n\nILEC\n\nUNEs, collocation and resale (TA'96\n\u00a7251c)\n\nIncumbent\ncable operator\n\nAllow access to rights of way, don't\nprohibit resale, etc. (\"CLEC\" rules:\nTA'96 \u00a7251b)\n\nRural telco\nAlternative\nfacility\nprovider\nMunicipality\n(typically\nthrough\nelectric utility)\n\nNone (TA'96 \u00a7251f exemptions preempt \u00a7251c)10\nAllow access to rights of way, don't\nprohibit resale, etc. (\"CLEC\" rules:\nTA'96 \u00a7251b)\nUnclear whether even allowed\n(differing state laws, pending court\ncases)\n\nType of Service\nData\n\u2022 UNEs, collocation and resale\n(TA'96 \u00a7251c)\n\u2022 Line sharing, DSL UNEs (FCC\nReport & Orders 3 & 4)\n\u2022 Separate subsidiary: not (merger\nconditions invalidated by courts;\nbut, watch PA)\n\u2022 Statutory: none\n\u2022 Court rulings: none\n\u2022 ATT v.

We speculate that companies that are already allowed to provide\nboth video and voice services might be more likely to offer integrated services over a future FTTH network.\n\nGillett & Tseng\n\n9\n\n\fVoice\n[* To be filled in with explanation of Table 2 *]\n\nData\n[* To be filled in with explanation of Table 2 *]\n\nVideo\n[* To be filled in with explanation of Table 2 *]\n\nCompetition Policies for Fiber to the Home\nAs shown in the previous section, separate regulatory regimes would apply to Fiber to the\nHome depending on the different providers (cable vs. telephone) and the services they\noffer. However, this regulatory asymmetry is increasingly untenable. As fiber gets\ndeployed deeper into the network, the networks are becoming more similar, both in the\ntransmission media and the services they support. Although asymmetric regulation may\nneed to exist in order to level the playing field between various market players, the\npotential differences should reflect differences based on market position (incumbent vs.\ncompetitor) rather than increasingly irrelevant technological distinctions. 11\nThere are issues with various specific regulatory approaches as well. The unbundling\nrules that apply to the telephone network are unworkable with rapidly changing\ntechnology such as FTTH. The unbundling requirements that currently apply to the\ntelephone network are difficult to implement effectively in the context of rapidly\nchanging technologies such as FTTH. Unbundling FTTH networks will require\ndefinition of new unbundled network elements (UNEs). However, many different\nFTTH technology options exist, and no dominant technology has emerged, making it\ndifficult to define the network elements much less deciding which should be unbundled.\nIt will also be difficult to set costs, since the network costs will vary with changing\ntechnology. Furthermore, the most detailed rules are very technology specific. It is also\npossible that the incumbents would architect their networks so as to circumvent these\npolicy restrictions.\nThe current FCC's approach taken towards the cable broadband is reactive rather than\nproactive: the government is waiting to see if competition develops before imposing\nregulation. However, the problem is that if competition does not develop, any policy\nwould have to be enforced within the confines of an anti-competitive market structure\nand technology, restricting the effectiveness of the policy. An alternative is the \"laissezfaire\" approach, where the government would remove the network sharing requirements\n11\n\nSee (Perucci and Cimatoribus 1997) for a discussion of when asymmetric regulation should be applied.\n\nGillett & Tseng\n\n10\n\n\ffrom the incumbent providers for the deployment of Fiber to the Home, in order to\nencourage facilities-based competition. However, due to the entrenched position of the\nincumbent monopolists, laissez faire will not lead to increased competition.\n\nConclusions\n[* Insert policy recommendation and concluding discussion *].\nPolicy makers need to define a consistent policy direction, in advance of technical\ndevelopment in order to shape technical choices now, rather than grafting them on later.\nThe policy goals regarding service level competition should be set while Fiber to the\nHome technology is still being developed. Once these requirements are defined, Fiber to\nthe Home technology can be designed in such a way that increases the opportunity for\nservice level competition. Different architectures make network sharing harder or easier\n(Table 3).\nTable 3: FTTH Technology Support for Service-Level Competition\n\nArchitecture\n\nDescription\n\nWhat's Shared\n\nHomeRun\n\nDedicated fiber per subscriber\n(direct connection between\nsubscriber and meet point)\n\nMeet point.
