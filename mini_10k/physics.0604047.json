Nevertheless, this property can be treated as an anomaly, because in the\nrest types of the fundamental interactions parity is conserved. Analogously, anomaly in shortduration strong-current pulse discharges is well known. The essence of this phenomenon consists\nin generation of local high-temperature plasma formations with typical values of its\nthermodynamic parameters exceeding those related to the central section of a discharge. In this\npaper, an attempt is undertaken to treat these anomalies as manifestations of the fundamental\nproperties of gravitational emission. Some consequences of this assumption can be tested in \u03b2\ndecay experiments as well as in experiments with short-duration z-pinch-type pulse discharges.\n\nPACS 1999 \u2013 04.90.+e , 52.55.Ez, 23.40.-s.\nKeywords: gravity, electron,\n\ndecay, discharge, fusion.\n\n\f1. Gravitational emission of electrons with a banded spectrum as emission of the\nsame level with electromagnetic emission.\n\nFor a mathematical model of interest, which describes a banded spectrum of stationary\nstates of electrons in the proper gravitational field, two aspects are of importance. First. In\nEinstein's field equations \u03ba is a constant which relates the space-time geometrical properties with\nthe distribution of physical matter, so that the origin of the equations is not connected with the\nnumerical limitation of the \u03ba value. Only the requirement of conformity with the Newtonian\nClassical Theory of Gravity leads to the small value \u03ba = 8\u03c0G/c4, where G, c are, respectively, the\nNewtonian gravitational constant and the velocity of light. Such requirement follows from the\nprimary concept of the Einstein General Theory of Relativity (GTR) as a relativistic\ngeneralization of the Newtonian Theory of Gravity. Second. The most general form of\nrelativistic gravitation equations are equations with the \u039b term. The limiting transition to weak\nfields leads to the equation\n\u2206\u03a6 = - 4\u03c0\u03c1G +\u039bc2,\nwhere \u03a6 is the field scalar potential, \u03c1 is the source density. This circumstance, eventually, is\ncrucial for neglecting the \u039b term, because only in this case the GTR is a generalization of the\nClassical Theory of Gravity. Therefore, the numerical values of \u03ba = 8\u03c0G/c4 and \u039b = 0 in the\nGTR equations are not associated with the origin of the equations, but follow only from the\nconformity of the GTR with the classical theory.\nFrom the 70's onwards, it became obvious [1] that in the quantum region the numerical\nvalue of G is not compatible with the principles of quantum mechanics. In a number of papers\n[1] (including [2]) it was shown that in the quantum region the coupling constant K (K \u2248 1040 G)\nis acceptable. The essence of the problem of the generalization of relativistic equations on the\nquantum level was thus outlined: such generalization must match the numerical values of the\ngravity constants in the quantum and classical regions.\nIn the development of these results, as a micro-level approximation of Einstein's field\nequations, a model is proposed, based on the following assumption:\nThe gravitational field within the region of localization of an elementary particle having a\nmass m0 is characterized by the values of the gravity constant K and of the constant \u039b that lead\nto the stationary states of the particle in its proper gravitational field, and the particle stationary\nstates as such are the sources of the gravitational field with the Newtonian gravity constant G.\nThe most general approach in the Gravity Theory is the one which takes twisting into\naccount and treats the gravitational field as a gage field, acting on equal terms with other\n2\n\n\ffundamental fields [3]. Such approach lacks in apriority gives no restrictions on the microscopic\nlevel. For an elementary spinor source with a mass m0, the set of equations describing its states\nin the proper gravitational field in accordance with the adopted assumption will have the form\n\n{ i\u03b3 ( \u2207\n\u03bc\n\nR\u03bc\u03bd \u2212\n\n\u03bc\n\n)\n\n}\n\n+ \u03ba \u03a8\u03b3 \u03bc \u03b3 5 \u03a8\u03b3 5 \u2212 m0 c h \u03a8 = 0\n\n{\n\n(\n\n1\ng R = \u2212\u03ba T\u03bc\u03bd ( E n ) \u2212 \u03bcg \u03bc\u03bd + g \u03bc\u03bd S\u03b1 S \u03b1 \u2212 S \u03bc S\u03bd\n2 \u03bc\u03bd\n\n(1)\n\n)}\n\n(2)\n\nR( K , \u039b , E n , rn ) = R(G , E n\u2032 , rn )\n\n(3)\n\n{i\u03b3\n\n}\n\n(4)\n\n1\ng \u03bc\u03bd R = \u2212\u03ba \u2032T\u03bc\u03bd (E n\u2032 )\n2\n\n(5)\n\n\u03bc\n\n\u2207 \u03bc \u2212 mn c h \u03a8 \u2032 = 0\n\nR \u03bc\u03bd \u2212\n\nThe following notations are used throughout the text of the paper: \u03ba = 8\u03c0K/c4, \u03ba' = =\n8\u03c0G/c4, En is the energy of stationary states in the proper gravitational field with the constant K,\n\u039b = \u03ba\u03bc, rn is the value of the coordinate r satisfying the equilibrium n-state in the proper\ngravitational field, \u03ba = \u03ba0 \u03ba, \u03ba0 is the dimensionality constant, Sa = \u03a8\u03b3 a \u03b3 5 \u03a8 , \u2207 is the spinorcoupling covariant derivative independent of twisting, E'n is the energy state of the particle\nhaving a mass mn (either free of field or in the external field), described by the wave function \u03c8'\nin the proper gravitational field with the constant G. The rest of the notations are generally\nadopted in the gravitation theory.\nEquations (1) through (5) describe the equilibrium states of particles (stationary states) in\nthe proper gravitational field and define the localization region of the field characterized by the\nconstant\n\nthat satisfies the equilibrium state. These stationary states are sources of the field with\n\nthe constant G, and condition (3) provides matching the solution with the gravitational constants\nand G. The proposed model in the physical aspect is compatible with the principles of\nquantum mechanics principles, and the gravitational field with the constants\n\nand \u039b at a certain,\n\nquite definite distance specified by the equilibrium state transforms into the filed having the\nconstant G and satisfying, in the weak field limit, the Poisson equation.\nThe set of equations (1) through (5), first of all, is of interest for the problem of stationary\nstates, i.e., the problem of energy spectrum calculations for an elementary source in the own\ngravitational field. In this sense it is reasonable to use an analogy with electrodynamics, in\nparticular, with the problem of electron stationary states in the Coulomb field. Transition from\nthe Schr\u00f6dinger equation to the Klein-Gordon relativistic equations allows taking into account\nthe fine structure of the electron energy spectrum in the Coulomb field, whereas transition to the\nDirac equation allows taking into account the relativistic fine structure and the energy level\nsplitting associated with spin-orbital interaction. Using this analogy and the form of equation (1),\n3\n\n\fone can conclude that solution of this equation without the term \u03ba \u03a8\u03b3 \u03bc \u03b3 5 \u03a8\u03b3 5 gives a spectrum\nsimilar to that of the fine structure (similar in the sense of relativism and removal of the principal\nquantum number degeneracy).. Taking the term \u03ba \u03a8\u03b3 \u03bc \u03b3 5 \u03a8\u03b3 5 into account, as is noted in [1], is\nsimilar to taking into account of the term \u03a8\u03bf \u03bc\u03bd \u03a8F\u03bc\u03bd in the Pauli equation. The latter implies\nthat the solution of the problem of stationary states with twisting taken into account will give a\ntotal energy-state spectrum with both the relativistic fine structure and energy state splitting\ncaused by spin-twist interaction taken into account. This fact, being in complete accord with the\nrequirements of the Gauge Theory of Gravity, allows us to believe that the above-stated\nassumptions concerning the properties of the gravitational field in the quantum region are\nrelevant, in the general case, just to the gravitational field with twists.\nComplexity of solving this problem compels us to employ a simpler approximation,\nnamely: energy spectrum calculations in a relativistic fine-structure approximation.

Even in the simplest\n\uf8ed h \uf8f8\napproximation the problem of the stationary states of an elementary source in the proper\ngravitational field is a complicated mathematical problem. It becomes simpler if we confine\nourselves to estimating only the energy spectrum. Equation (6) can be reduced in many ways to\nthe equations [6]\nf \u2032 = fP (r ) + Q(r )z\nz \u2032 = fF (r ) + S (r )z\n(18)\nThis transition implies specific choice of P, Q, F, S, such that the conditions\n\nP + S + Q\u2032 / Q + g = 0\n\nFQ + P \u2032 + P 2 + Pg + h = 0\n\n(19)\n\nshould be fulfilled, where g and h correspond to equation.

As one of the simplest approximations for v,\u03bb, we shall choose the\ndependence:\n\ne\u03bd = e \u2212\u03bb = 1 \u2212\n\nr~n\n2\n+ \u039b( r \u2212 C2 ) + C3 r\nr + C1\n\nWhere n= (2K / 3)Kn, C1 =\n\n(24)\n\nr~n\nr~n\n=\n,\nC\n,\nC\nr\n=\n3\n2\nn\n\u039brn2\nrn (rn + C1 )\n\nIf we assume that the observed value of the electron rest mass m1 is its mass in the ground\nstationary state in the proper gravitational field, then mo = 4m1/3. From dimensionality\nconsiderations it follows that energy in the bound state is defined by the expression\n\n(\n\nKm 0\n\n)\n\n2\n\n/ r1 = 0.17 \u00d7 10 6 \u00d7 1.6 \u00d7 10 \u221219 J, where r1 is the classical electron radius. This leads to the\n\nestimate K \u2248 5.1\u00d71031 Nm2kg-2 which is later adopted as the starting one. It is known that by use\nof the dependence E 0 =\n\ne2\n= mc 2\nr0\n\nfor the impulse we receive the expression Pi =\n\n4 E0\nv i , that\n3 c2\n\nis differentiated by the multiplier 4/3 from the correct expression for the impulse of the particles,\nthe mass of which is m =\n\nE0\n. It is this fact that points at the correctness of the estimates\nc2\n\nreceived for the electron, because the lacking part of the energy is in the bound state. From the\ncondition that \u03bc is the electron energy density it follows: \u03bc = 1.1\u00d71030 J/m3, \u039b = \u03ba\u03bc=4.4\u00d71029 m2\n\n.

For eliminating rn from (26), there exists condition (9) (or the\ncondition exp \u03bd(K,rn) = 1 equivalent to it for the approximation employed), but its direct use will\ncomplicate the already cumbersome expression (26) still further. At the same time, it easy to note\nthat rn ~ 10-3 rnc, where rnc is the Compton wavelength of a particle of the mass mn, and, hence,\nrn ~ 10-3 Kn -1.The relation (26) per se is rather approximate, but, nevertheless, its availability,\nirrespective of the accuracy of the approximation, implies the existence of an energy spectrum as\na consequence of the particle self-interaction with its own gravitational field in the range r \u2264 rn,\nwhere mutually compensating action of the field and the particle takes place. With l = 0 the\napproximate solution (26), with the relation between rn and Kn taken into account, has the form\n\n(\n\nE n = E0 1 + \u03b1e \u2212 \u03b2n\n\n)\n\n\u22121\n\n,\n\n(27)\n\nwhere \u03b1 = 1.65, \u03b2 = 1.60.\nThe relation (27) is concretized, proceeding from the assumption that the observed value\nof the electron rest mass is the value of its mass in the grounds stationary state in the proper\ngravitational field, the values r1 = 2.82 x 10-15 m, Kl = 0.41 x 1012 m-1 giving exact zero of the\nfunction by the very definition of the numerical values for\n\nand \u039b.\n\nSo, the presented numerical estimates for the electron show that within the range of its\nlocalization, with K~ 1031N m2 kg-2 and \u039b~ 1029m-2, there exists the spectrum of stationary states\nin the pr per gravitational field. The numerical value of K is, certainly, universal for any\nelementary source, whereas the value of \u039b is defined by the rest mass of the elementary source.\nThe distance at which the gravitational field with the constant\n\nis localized is less than the\n\nCompton wavelength, and for the electron, for example, this value is of the order of its classical\nradius. At distances larger than this one, the gravitational field is characterized by the constant G,\ni.e., correct transition to Classical GTR holds.\n7\n\n\fFrom equation (27) there follow in a rough approximation the numerical values of the\nstationary state energies: E1 =0.511 MeV, E2 =0.638 MeV, ... E\u221e =0.681 MeV.\nQuantum transitions over stationary states must lead to the gravitational emission\ncharacterized by the constant K with transition energies starting from 127 keV to 170 keV Two\ncircumstances are essential here.\nFirst. The correspondence between the electromagnetic and gravitational interaction\ntakes place on replacement of the electric charge e by the gravitational \"charge\" m K , so that\nthe numerical values K place the electromagnetic and gravitational emission effects on the same\nlevel (for instance, the electromagnetic and gravitational bremsstrahlung cross-sections will\ndiffer only by the factor 0.16 in the region of coincidence of the emission spectra).\nSecond. The natural width of the energy levels in the above-indicated spectrum of the\nelectron stationary states will be from 10-9 eV to 10-7 eV. The small value of the energy level\nwidths, compared to the electron energy spread in real conditions, explains why the gravitational\nemission effects are not observed as a mass phenomenon in epiphenomena, e.g., in the processes\nof electron beam bremsstrahlung on targets. A direct confirmation of the presence of the electron\nstationary states in the own gravitational field with the constant K may be the presence of the\nlower boundary of nuclear \u03b2-decay. Only starting with this boundary \u03b2-asymmetry can take\nplace, which is interpreted as parity non-conservation in weak interactions, but is actually only a\nconsequence of the presence of the excited states of electrons in the own gravitational field in \u03b2decay. Beta-asymmetry was observed experimentally only in \u03b2-decay of heavy nuclei in\nmagnetic field (for example,\n\n60\n27C\n\nin the known experiment carried out by Wu [7]. On light\n\nnuclei, such as 1H3, where the \u03b2-decay asymmetry already must not take place, similar\nexperiments were not carried out.\n\n2. Gravitational Emission in Dense High-Temperature Plasma\n2.1. Excitation of Gravitational Emission in Plasma\n\nFor the above-indicated energies of transitions over stationary states in the own field and\nthe energy level widths, the sole object in which gravitational emission can be realized as a mass\nphenomenon will be, as follows from the estimates given below, a dense high-temperature\nplasma.\nUsing the Born approximation for the bremsstrahlung cross-section, we can write down\nthe expression for the electromagnetic bremsstrahlung per unit of volume per unit of time as\n\nQe =\n\n32\n3\n\n2\n\nz 2 r0\nmc 2 ne ni\n137\n\n2k Te\n= 0.17 \u00d7 10 \u221239 z 2 ne ni Te ,\n\u03c0m\n\n(28)\n8\n\n\fwhere Te, k, ni, ne, m, z, ro are the electron temperature, Boltzmann's constant, the concentration\nof the ionic and electronic components, the electron mass, the serial number of the ionic\ncomponent, the classical electron radius, respectively.\nReplacing ro by rg = 2K m/c2 (which corresponds to replacing the electric charge e by the\ngravitational charge m K ), we can use for the gravitational bremsstrahlung the relation\nQg = 0.16Qe.\n\n(29)\n\nFrom (28) it follows that in a dense high-temperature plasma with parameters ne = ni =\n1023 m-3, Te = 107 K, the specific power of the electromagnetic bremsstrahlung is equal to \u2248 0.53\n1010 J/m3 s, and the specific power of the gravitational bremsstrahlung is 0.86 109 J/m3 s. These\nvalues of the plasma parameters, apparently, can be adopted as guide threshold values of an\nappreciable gravitational emission level, because the relative proportion of the electrons whose\nenergy on the order of the energy of transitions in the own gravitational field, diminishes in\naccordance with the Maxwellian distribution exponent as Te decreases.\n\n2.2. Amplification of Gravitational Emission in Plasma\nFor the numerical values of the plasma parameters Te = Ti = (!07-108)K, ne = ni =\n(1023-1025) m-3 the electromagnetic bremsstrahlung spectrum will not change essentially with\nCompton scattering of electron emission, and the bremsstrahlung itself is a source of emission\nlosses of a high-temperature plasma. The frequencies of this continuous spectrum are on the\norder of (1018-1020) s-1, while the plasma frequency for the above-cited plasma parameters is\n(1013-1014) s-1, or 0.1 eV of the energy of emitted quanta.\nThe fundamental distinction of the gravitational bremsstrahlung from the electromagnetic\nbremsstrahlung is the banded spectrum of the gravitational emission, corresponding to the\nspectrum of the electron stationary states in the own gravitational field.\nThe presence of cascade transitions from the upper excited levels to the lower ones will\nlead to that the electrons, becoming excited in the energy region above 100 keV, will be emitted,\nmainly, in the eV region, i.e., energy transfer along the spectrum to the low-frequency region\nwill take place. Such energy transfer mechanism can take place only in quenching spontaneous\nemission from the lower electron energy levels in the own gravitational field, which rules out\nemission with quantum energy in the keV region. A detailed description of the mechanism of\nenergy transfer along the spectrum will hereafter give its precise numerical characteristics.\nNevertheless, undoubtedly, the very fact of its existence, conditioned by the banded character of\nthe spectrum of the gravitational bremsstrahlung, can be asserted. The low-frequency character\n\n9\n\n\fof the gravitational bremsstrahlung spectrum will lead to its amplification in plasma by virtue of\nthe locking condition \u03c9 g \u2264 0.5 10 3 ne being fulfilled.\nFrom the standpoint of practical realization of the states of a high-temperature plasma\ncompressed by the emitted gravitational field, two circumstances are of importance.\nFirst. Plasma must comprise two components, with multiply charged ions added to\nhydrogen, these ions being necessary for quenching spontaneous emission of electrons from the\nground energy levels in the own gravitational field. For this purpose it is necessary to have ions\nwith the energy levels of electrons close to the energy levels of free excited electrons. Quenching\nof the lower excited states of the electrons will be particularly effective in the presence of a\nresonance between the energy of excited electron and the energy of electron excitation in the ion\n(in the limit, most favorable case - ionization energy). An increase of z increases also the\nspecific power of the gravitational bremsstrahlung, so that on the condition \u03c9 g \u2264 0.5 10 3 ne\nbeing fulfilled, the equality of the gas-kinetic pressure and the radiation pressure\nk(ne Te + ni Ti) = 0.16(0.17 10-39 z2 ne ni\n\nTe )\u2206t\n\n(30)\n\nwill take place at \u2206t = (10-6 -10-7) s for the permissible parameter values of compressed plasma\nne = (1 + a) ni = (1025 - 1026) m-3, a > 2, Te \u2248 Te = 108 K, z >10.\nSecond. The necessity of plasma ejection from the region of the magnetic field with the\ntentative parameters ne = (1023 - 1024) m-3, Te = (107 - 108) K with subsequent energy\npumping from the magnetic field region.\n\n2.3. States of hydrostatic equilibrium of the plasma in the emitted gravitational field\n\nAn analysis of the processes [8, 9] which take place in the known devices for generating\nstable high-temperature states of a plasma (as well as the absence of encouraging results)\nsuggests that the magnetic field can be used only partially, in the first step for the retention and\nheating plasma in the process of forming its high-energy state. Further presence of the magnetic\nfield no longer confines the plasma within a limited volume, but destroys this plasma owing to\nthe specific character of motion of charged particles in the magnetic field. A principal solution of\nthe problem is a method of confining of an already heated plasma in an emitted gravitational\nfield in a second step, after the plasma has been compressed, heated and retained during this\nperiod by the magnetic\n\nfield. As follows from the above-stated, under any circumstances\n\nplasma must be injected from the magnetic field region, but with subsequent pumping of energy\nfrom the region of the plasma found in the magnetic field.\n\n10\n\n\fThe fulfillment of the above-cited conditions (in principle, irrespective of a particular scheme of\nthe apparatus in which these conditions are realized), and namely:\na) generation of a dense high-temperature plasma from hydrogen and isotopes thereof with the\naid of pulsed heavy-current discharges;\nb) injection of the plasma from the area of a magnetic field with parameters corresponding to the\nconditions of gravitational emission of electrons with a banded energy spectrum;\nc) energy transfer along the spectrum performed by cascade transition into the long wavelength\nregion of eV-energy to the state of locking and amplification of the gravitational emission and\nsimultaneous compression to the states of hydrostatic equilibrium, and in the formation of the\nstates, mentioned for the stage c) in the composition of a working gas multielectron atoms are\nused for quenching the spontaneous gravitational emission from the ground energy levels of the\nkeV-region electron in its own gravitational field,\nsolves solely the problem of attaining hydrostatic equilibrium states of plasma. The use of a\nmultielectron gas (carbon) as the additive to hydrogen leads to the realization of nuclear fusion\nreaction conditions, since carbon will simultaneously will act as a catalyst required for the\nnuclear fusion reaction [10].\nAnother variant of nuclear fusion in compositions with multielectron atoms, such as\nxenon, krypton (and allied elements) is the use as the light component of deuterium or a\ndeuterium-tritium mixture (the last-mentioned variant is the most cumbersome one because of\nthe forming of neutrons during the fusion).\n\nConclusion\n1. The approximation of Einstein's relativistic gravitation equations is examined,\nwherein the values of gravitational constant K and constant \u039b in the region of elementary\nparticles localization are defined in such a way that this leads to stationary states of the particles\nin their own gravitational field, and the particles stationary states themselves are the sources of\nthe field with Newtonian gravitational constant G.\n2. The consequences of the quantum character of gravitational interaction, which are\navailable for experimental testing, are:\na) asymmetry of electrons scattering on the energies in \u03b2-decay in the strong magnetic\nfield;\nb) state of hydrostatic equilibrium of dense high-temperature plasma in the emitted\ngravitational field.\n\n11\n\n\fReferences\n1.\n\nSiravam C. and Sinha K., Phys.
