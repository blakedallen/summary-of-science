Y. Chen,\nJ. Chem. Phys. 129, 091101 (2008)]. This note adopts the definitions in the original formulation\nof the JE and CFT and demonstrates the contrary.\n\nConsider the problem of an overdamped Brownian particle moving under the action of a time-dependent potential U (x, t) over the whole line \u2212\u221e < x < \u221e in the time\ninterval 0 \u2264 t \u2264 \u03c4 . Let us define the following objects of\ninterest (for simplicity of notation, I will set kB T = 1):\n(a) The free energy difference\n\u2206F := \u2212 ln\n\nZ\u03c4\n,\nZ0\n\n(1)\n\nwhere the partition function Zt corresponding to the instantaneous energy surface U (x, t) is defined as\nZ \u221e\nZt :=\ndx e\u2212U(x,t) ;\n(2)\n\u2212\u221e\n\n(b) The work functional defined along a given trajectory x(t),\nZ \u03c4\n\u2202U (x(t), t)\nW [x(t)] :=\ndt\n,\n(3)\n\u2202t\n0\nwhere the partial derivative \u2202/\u2202t keeps x(t) constant;\nand lastly\n(c) The Jarzynski average, defined as the average\nh*i over all possible trajectories x(t) propagated under U (x, t) from t = 0 to t = \u03c4 , where x(0) is sampled from the initial Boltzmann distribution p(x(0)) =\ne\u2212U(x(0),0) /Z0 . (An expression for such an average in\nterms of e.g. path integrals can be immediately written\ndown, but this is not relevant for the present discussion).\nMaking explicit and unambiguous use of definitions\n(a)-(c), the Jarzynski equality (JE) [1]\ne\u2212W = e\u2212\u2206F ,\n\n(4)\n\nhas been proven through several different approaches in\nthe literature (see [2] for a review).\nPrevious derivations notwithstanding, a skeptic might\nquestion the validity of Eq. (4) at two rather distinct levels; namely, the appropriateness of the definitions (a)-(c),\nor-once such definitions are agreed upon-the correctness of the ensuing equality itself. The first is mostly\na matter of historical context and semantics, and will\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\naddress: adiba@mail.nih.gov\n\nnot be the subject of the present paper (see e.g. [3, 4]\nfor a discussion on definitions (a)-(b)). The second, on\nthe other hand, would imply some type of mathematical\ninconsistency in the steps leading up to Eq. (4).\nIn Ref. [5], the two levels of inquiry above have been\nblurred together, leading its author to-among other\nmisconceptions-claim that Eq. (4) is \"violated for a simple model system driven far from equilibrium.\" What is\nmissing in such claim is the necessary qualification that\nthe original underpinnings of the equality, i.e. definitions\n(a)-(c), have been tampered with. The object of this note\nis to point out that precisely the opposite conclusion is\nreached if one uses the original definitions.\nTo proceed, consider the forward and reverse energy\nfunctions, Uf (x, t) and Ur (x, t) respectively, satisfying\nthe condition\nUf (x, t) = Ur (x, \u03c4 \u2212 t),\n\n(5)\n\nfor 0 \u2264 t \u2264 \u03c4 . This mapping between energy functions\nis the continuum analog of Crooks's forward and reverse\nprocesses [6], and was presumably implicit in the treatment of Ref. [5]. (When such energy functions are used\ninstead of U (x, t) in the definitions (a)-(b), the appropriate subscripts f and r will be added to the corresponding\nquantities; for (c), i.e. the average h*i, the energy function is specified by the subscript of the quantity inside\nthe brackets).\nSince the forward and reverse energy functions coincide at the opposite ends of the time interval, i.e.\nUf (x, 0) = Ur (x, \u03c4 ) and Uf (x, \u03c4 ) = Ur (x, 0), we have\ntrivially \u2206Fr = \u2212\u2206Ff , and thus the JE leads directly to\nEq. (4) of Ref. [5]:\ne\u2212Wf\n\ne\u2212Wr = 1.\n\n(6)\n\nIt is worth emphasizing that this result exists independently of the Crooks fluctuation theorem (CFT) or its\ngeneralizations, such as Eq. (1) of Ref. [5]; indeed, as we\nhave just seen, it is merely an application of the Jarzynski equality twice for energy functions that coincide at\nopposite ends of the time interval, as expressed above.\nNonetheless, for problems satisfying Eq. (5) and microscopic reversibility, its breakdown would imply that both\nthe CFT and the JE are violated, as for such problems\nthe former also requires Eq. (6) to be true [5].\nThe central exercise of Ref. [5] was to consider a simple\nchoice of U (x, t) that allows for analytical computations,\n\n\f2\nand test the validity of the JE and CFT through Eq. (6).\nThis program was carried out indirectly by considering\nsystems whose work distributions are known to be Gaussian, in which case the exponential averages of work in\nEq. (6) can be straightforwardly reduced to their first and\nsecond moments. This Gaussian assumption leads finally\nto Chen's self-consistency condition (Eq. (6) of Ref. [5]),\nnamely\n\u0001\n1 2\n\u03c3 + \u03c3r2 ,\nhWf i + hWr i =\n2 f\n\n(7)\n\nwhere \u03c3f2 \u2261 h(Wf \u2212 hWf i)2 i and similarly for \u03c3r2 . In\nthe following, I will consider the same model system of\nRef. [5], and compute such moments analytically using\nthe original definitions (a)-(c).\nChen's system can be described by the forward energy\nfunction\nUf (x, t) =\n\nk 2\nx \u2212 f0 \u03b8(t) x.\n2\n\n(8)\n\nThis is a simple harmonic potential whose center z(t) =\nf0 \u03b8(t)/k is instantaneously displaced, at t = 0, from the\ninitial position z(0) = 0 to the final position z(\u03c4 ) = f0 /k.\n[I am using the convention that the step function \u03b8(t)\nvanishes at t = 0, which is consistent with Chen's choice\nof initial conditions, viz. hx(0)i\n= 0. This convention\nR\u03c4\nimplies, in particular, that 0 dt x(t)\u03b8\u0307(t) = x(0) for any\nfinite \u03c4 > 0, a result that is used in Eqs. (9) and (12)].\nAccordingly, Uf (x, 0) = k2 x2 , and with definition (b) we\nhave\nZ \u03c4\nWf [x(t)] = \u2212f0\ndt x(t)\u03b4(t) = \u2212f0 x(0).\n(9)\n0\n\nThus, the moments of Wf reduce to moments of the initial coordinate x(0), which give\nhWf i = 0,\n\n\u03c3f2 =\n\nf02\n.\nk\n\n(10)\n\n[1] C.

Jarzynski, Phys. Rev. Lett. 101,\n\nSimilarly, with the reverse energy function (cf. Eq. (5))\nUr (x, t) =\n\nk 2\nx \u2212 f0 \u03b8(\u03c4 \u2212 t) x,\n2\n\n(11)\n\nwe have\nWr [x(t)] = f0\n\nZ\n\n\u03c4\n\ndt x(t)\u03b4(\u03c4 \u2212 t) = f0 x(\u03c4 ).\n\n(12)\n\n0\n\nSince the original equilibrium state specified by\nUr (x(0), 0) is not perturbed until t = \u03c4 , the coordinate\nx(\u03c4 ) is distributed like x(0), and thus\nhWr i =\n\nf02\n,\nk\n\n\u03c3r2 =\n\nf02\n.\nk\n\n(13)\n\nWith the results given by Eqs. (10) and (13), Chen's selfconsistency condition (Eq. (7)) is immediately satisfied,\nq.e.d.\nSome final remarks are in order. Though never unambiguously stated in Ref. [5], it seems like the analysis\noffered by Chen departed from the original formulation\nof the Jarzynski equality and the Crooks fluctuation theorem in the definition of work, i.e. in definition (b) of\nthe present note. Using the original definition, the free\nenergy difference \u2206F obtained via the Jarzynski equality\nand Eqs. (10) and (13) (cf. Eq. (5) of Ref. [5]) is \u2212f02 /(2k)\nfor the forward, and +f02 /(2k) for the reverse process, in\nagreement with the different approach of Ref. [4], and\nconsistent with the simple observation that the free energy difference between two states changes sign upon a\nchange of direction in the process. Had Chen adhered to\nthe original definitions, no controversy would have arisen.\nThe author would like to thank Attila Szabo for bringing Chen's manuscript to his attention.
