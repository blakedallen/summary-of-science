The central issues in realizing\nhigher Tc are to seek novel spacer layers and engineer them to tune the electronic\nstates of Fe2 As2 layers in which high-Tc superconductivity emerges. The crystal structure of iron-based superconductors can be classified according to their spacer layers,\nwhich are (i) alkali or alkali-earth ions, as in LiFeAs2) and BaFe2 As2 ,3) (ii) slabs of rareearth oxides or alkali-earth fluorides with a fluorite-type structure, as in LaFeAsO1) and\n\u2217\n\nE-mail address: kudo@science.okayama-u.ac.jp\n\n\fJ.

Using X-ray diffraction and chemical analyses, we identified the compounds to be Ca10 (Pt4 As8 )(Fe2\u2212x Ptx As2 )5 (referred to as\n\u03b1-phase) and Ca10 (Pt3 As8 )(Fe2\u2212x Ptx As2 )5 (referred to as \u03b2-phase). Both compounds\ncrystallize in triclinic structures with the space group P 1\u0304 (\u266f 2). The \u03b1-phase exhibits\nsuperconductivity at Tc \u2243 38 K, the \u03b2-phase at Tc \u2243 13 K.\n\nSingle crystals of Ca10 (Ptn As8 )(Fe2\u2212x Ptx As2 )5 were grown by heating a mixture of\n\nCa, FeAs, Pt, and As powders. The mixture of 0.5 g with a ratio of Ca : Fe : Pt : As =\n23 : 23 : 10 : 44 was placed in an alumina crucible (inner diameter of 6 mm and length of\n60 mm) and sealed in an evacuated quartz tube. All manipulations were carried out in\na glove box filled with argon gas. The ampules were heated in two ways. Heating at 700\n\u25e6\n\nC for 3 h and then at 1000 \u25e6 C for 72 h followed by slow cooling to room temperature\n\nyielded an \u03b1-phase with Tc = 38 K, whereas heating at 1100 \u25e6 C and slow cooling to\n1050 \u25e6 C for 40 h yielded a \u03b2-phase with Tc = 13 K. The \u03b2-phase was obtained as a single phase without any secondary phases. In contrast, the \u03b1-phase was always obtained\nin the form of a mixture of \u03b1-phase crystals and slag containing nonsuperconducting Ca(Fe1\u2212x Ptx )2 As2 (x \u2243 0.08) and Ca2 As powders. We obtained platelike crystals\n\nwith a typical size of 1 \u00d7 1 \u00d7 0.1 mm3 for both phases. The crystals were characterized by synchrotron radiation X-ray diffraction14, 15) and electron-probe microanalysis\n\n(EPMA). Longitudinal and Hall resistivities were measured using a Physical Property\nMeasurement System (Quantum Design). Magnetization was measured using a SQUID\nmagnetometer (Quantum Design).\nSingle-crystal structure analysis reveals that the compounds crystallize in triclinic\nstructures with the space group P 1\u0304 (\u266f 2). The structures consist of alternating stacking\nof (Fe2 As2 )5 and Ptn As8 layers (n = 4 for \u03b1-phase and n = 3 for \u03b2-phase) with five Ca\nions between them, as depicted in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b). Tiny crystals with dimensions\nof approximately 50 \u00d7 50 \u00d7 20 \u03bcm3 prevented us from determining the superconducting and normal-state properties of the crystals used for single-crystal structure\n\nanalysis.

Crystallographic\ndata are summarized in Table I and II.\nThe most notable feature of the present compounds is the presence of Ptn As8 layers,\ndepicted in Figs. 1(c) and 1(d). These platinum arsenide layers are characterized by a\ndistorted square lattice of corner-sharing PtAs4 squares. Rotations of the PtAs4 squares\nresult in the formation of As2 dimers, as indicated by the dashed ellipsoids in Figs. 1(c)\nand 1(d). Such As2 dimers are observed in pyrite-type structures; the Pt4 As8 layers can\nbe derived from the ab-plane of pyrite PtAs2 . The size of the Pt square lattice (with\na Pt-Pt distance of approximately 4.4 \u00c5) is by far larger than the size of the Fe2 As2\nsquare lattice (approximately 3.9 \u00c5 for CaFe2 As2 ). This lattice mismatch leads to the\n\u221a\n\u221a\nformation of the 5 \u00d7 5 superstructure in the ab-plane in the present compounds, as\n\ndepicted in Figs. 1(e) and 1(f). There exist Pt vacancies in the platinum arsenide layers\nof the \u03b2-phase, as shown in Fig. 1(d), to form the Pt3 As8 layers.\n\nThe Pt3 As8 layers alternating with Fe2 As2 layers were directly confirmed for the\n\n\fJ.

Ltd.) with an aberration\ncorrector (CEOS GmbH). In this image, intensity is approximately proportional to Z 2 ,\nwhere Z is the atomic number; thus the brightest spots correspond to Pt, and the\nfaintest spots correspond to Ca. Ca is located between the Fe2 As2 and Pt3 As8 layers,\nconsistent with the X-ray refinements.\nFigure 3 shows the electrical resistivity of \u03b1- and \u03b2-phases of different batches as a\nfunction of temperature. For sample \u266f3 with the \u03b1-type structure, the resistivity shows\nmetallic behavior. The resistivity starts to decrease sharply at 37 K and becomes negligibly small below 32.7 K. The 10%\u221290% transition width is approximately 2 K. This\nresult suggests that the sample becomes superconducting below 32.7 K. The resistivity\nof \u266f1 with the \u03b2-type structure exhibits semiconducting behavior below about 110 K,\nfollowed by a decrease below 27 K. Zero resistivity was observed below 13.5 K. The resistivity of \u266f2 with the \u03b1-type structure shows an intermediate behavior between those\nobserved in \u266f1 and \u266f3.\nEvidence of bulk superconductivity can be seen in the temperature dependence of\nmagnetization M shown in Fig. 4. All samples exhibited a diamagnetic behavior, a\nhallmark of superconductivity. The onset Tc 's were estimated to be 38 K, 29 K, and\n13 K for \u266f4, \u266f2, and \u266f1, respectively. The shielding volume fraction at 5 K without\ndemagnetizing-field corrections were 139, 163, and 82% for \u266f4, \u266f2, and \u266f1, respectively.\nThus the highest Tc of 38 K was obtained in the \u03b1-phase (\u266f4).\nThe Hall coefficient RH , shown in Fig. 5, is negative for all samples, suggesting that\nthe major carriers are electrons in both \u03b1- and \u03b2-phases.

(Color online) Temperature dependence of Hall coefficient for Ca10 (Pt4 As8 )(Fe2\u2212x Ptx As2 )5\n(\u03b1-phase) and Ca10 (Pt3 As8 )(Fe2\u2212x Ptx As2 )5 (\u03b2-phase).\n\npendence of RH observed in the \u03b2-phase (\u266f1), as well as the semiconducting resistivity\nat low temperatures, is reminiscent of underdoped materials. Indeed, analogous behaviors are observed in the underdoped Ba(Fe1\u2212x Cox )2 As2 with x = 0.05.16) RH for the\n\u03b1-phase (\u266f2 and 3) exhibits a weak but distinct temperature dependence, which again\nis analogous to those reported in optimally doped Ba(Fe1\u2212x Cox )2 As2 with x = 0.09.16)\nThe Pt content of x/2 \u2243 0.18 for optimally doped Ca10 (Pt4 As8 )(Fe2\u2212x Ptx As2 )5 is by\n\nfar larger than the Co content for optimally doped Ba(Fe1\u2212x Cox )2 As2 (x = 0.09), suggesting that Pt causes the doping of fewer electrons than Co, the most studied dopant\nfor iron-based materials. This is consistent with the absence of superconductivity in\nCa(Fe1\u2212x Ptx )2 As2 up to the solubility limit of x \u2243 0.08.\n\nFormal electron counts of As2 dimers and isolated As are [As2 ]4\u2212 and As3\u2212 , respec-\n\ntively. Since all As atoms form dimers in Ptn As8 layers and all As atoms are isolated\nin Fe2 As2 layers, we expect a formal electron count of Fe2+ and Pt2+ for the \u03b2-phase,\nCa10 (Pt3 As8 )(Fe2 As2 )5 . Thus, Ca10 (Pt3 As8 )(Fe2 As2 )5 can be viewed as a parent compound.\nThe novel spacer layers of the present materials, namely, Ptn As8 (n = 3 and 4)\nlayers, will give us a unique opportunity to further engineer iron-based materials to\noptimize superconductivity. First, the present materials with an interlayer distance\nbetween Fe2 As2 of d \u2243 10 \u00c5 fill the materials gap between SmFeAsO with d \u2243 8.6\n\n\u00c5 and Sr4 V2 O6 Fe2 As2 with d \u2243 15.67 \u00c5. Smaller d than that of SmFeAsO tends to\nlead to lower Tc .13, 17) Larger d than that of Sr4 V2 O6 Fe2 As2 also seems to lead to lower\n\nTc .13) We naively expect that an optimal distance for higher Tc may exist in the d range\nof the present materials. Secondly, the nature of chemical bonds of the spacer layers\n\n\fJ. Phys. Soc. Jpn.\n\nLETTERS\n\nseems to be quite different between the present materials and the previous iron-based\nsuperconductors. The spacer layers of the previous materials, alkali/alkali-earth ions or\ncomplex oxides/fluorides, are electrically inert because of the ionic chemical bonds. Thus\nno atomic orbitals of the spacer layers mix with the Fe 3d orbitals of the superconducting\nFe2 As2 layers. In contrast, the chemical bonds of the present spacers layers, a platinum\narsenide, are covalent in nature; thus we expect that Pt orbitals may contribute to\ncharge transport and possibly to superconductivity. Indeed, most platinum arsenides\nare metallic and even superconductivity has been observed in SrPt2 As2 18) and SrPtAs.19)\nFurther investigations will be invaluable to determine whether novel electronic states\nare realized in the present materials.\nRecently, Ni et al.20) reported superconductivity and crystal structures on\nCa10 (Pt4 As8 )(Fe2 As2 )5 and Ca10 (Pt3 As8 )(Fe2 As2 )5 , based on our previous report.21)\nThe \u03b1-phase and \u03b2-phase in the present study most likely correspond to 10-4-8 and 103-8 phases reported by Ni et al.20) Higher Tc was observed in the present study, likely\ndue to the difference in Pt contents in the Fe2 As2 layers.\nIn\n\nsummary,\n\nwe\n\nreported\n\nthat\n\nthe\n\nquaternary\n\niron-based\n\nmaterials\n\nCa10 (Pt4 As8 )(Fe2\u2212x Ptx As2 )5 and Ca10 (Pt3 As8 )(Fe2\u2212x Ptx As2 )5 exhibit superconductivity at 38 K and 13 K, respectively. Both materials consist of novel platinum-arsenide\nspacer layers, namely, Ptn As8 layers. This finding demonstrated that a variety of spacer\nlayers are possible in iron-based superconductors. Engineering of this novel spacer layer\nwill lead to higher superconducting transition temperatures in this class of materials.\nWe thank C.-H. Lee for valuable discussion and M. Takasuga, S.
