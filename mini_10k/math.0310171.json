It is devoted to the notions of\nderived tameness and wildness of algebras and the recent progress in the\ntopic. The main result, obtained by Viktor Bekkert and the author, is the\ntame-wild dichotomy for derived categories, which is an analogue of the author's theorem for algebras [5]. The proof is also very much alike that of [5];\nit relies on the technique of matrix problems (representations of boxes) and\na reduction algorithm for matrices. The principal distinction is that here\nwe have to consider non-free (even non-semi-free) boxes. Fortunately, the\nrequired class of boxes can be dealt with in a similar way; it is considered\nin Section 3 of this paper. Section 1 is devoted to the general notions related to derived categories, derived tameness, etc., while Section 2 presents\na transition to matrix problems. Further, we consider the results related to\ndeformations and degenerations of derived tame and derived wild algebras\nobtained by the author [7]. Namely, in Section 4 we construct some \"almost\nversal\" families of complexes with projective bases, analogous to the families\nof modules constructed in [8]. It makes possible to introduce the \"number\nof parameters\" defining complexes of given rank and to prove (in Section 5)\nthat this number is upper semi-continuous in flat families of algebras. As\na corollary, we get that a deformation of a derived tame algebra is derived\ntame; respectively, a degeneration of a derived wild algebra is derived wild.\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification.

Derived categories\nIn what follows we consider finite dimensional algebras over an algebraically closed field k. Let A be such an algebra. As usually, we write\n\u2297 and Hom instead of \u2297k and Homk ; we denote by V \u2217 the dual vector\nspace Hom(V, k). All considered categories A are also supposed to be linear categories over the field k, which means that all sets A(a, b) are vector\nspaces over k and the multiplication of morphisms is k-bilinear. Recall that\nthe derived category D(A) of (finite dimensional) A-modules is defined as\nfollows [13, 14]. First consider the category of complexes C(A). Its objects are sequences M\u2022 = (Mn , dn ) of finite dimensional modules and their\nhomomorphisms\n(1)\n\ndn+2\n\ndn+1\n\nd\n\ndn\u22121\n\ndn+2\n\ndn+1\n\nd\n\ndn\u22121\n\nd\u2032n+2\n\nd\u2032n+1\n\nd\u2032\n\nd\u2032n\u22121\n\n. . . \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 Mn+1 \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 Mn \u2212\u2212\u2212n\u2212\u2192 Mn\u22121 \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 . . .\nsuch that dn+1 dn = 0 for all n. A morphism \u03c6\u2022 = (\u03c6n ) of a complex (1) to\nanother complex M\u2022\u2032 = (Mn\u2032 , d\u2032n ) is a commutative diagram\n\n(2)\n\n. . . \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 Mn+1 \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 Mn \u2212\u2212\u2212n\u2212\u2192 Mn\u22121 \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 . . .\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\u03c6n+1 y\n\u03c6n\u22121 y\n\u03c6n y\n\n\u2032\n\u2032\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 . . .\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 Mn\u2032 \u2212\u2212\u2212n\u2212\u2192 Mn\u22121\n. . . \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 Mn+1\n\nOne says that such a morphism is homotopic to zero if there are homomor\u2032\nphisms \u03c3n : Mn \u2192 Mn+1\n(n \u2208 N) such that \u03c6n = \u03c3n\u22121 dn + d\u2032n+1 \u03c3n for all n.\nThe factor category H(A) of C(A) modulo the ideal of morphisms homotopic\nto zero is called the homotopic category of A-modules. For each n the n-th\nhomology of a complex (1) is defined as Hn (M\u2022 ) = Ker dn / Im dn+1 . Obviously, a morphism \u03c6\u2022 of complexes induces homomorphisms of homologies\nHn (\u03c6\u2022 ) : Hn (M\u2022 ) \u2192 Hn (M\u2022\u2032 ), and if \u03c6\u2022 is homotopic to zero, it induces zero\nhomomorphisms of homologies. Hence, Hn can be considered as functors\nH(A) \u2192 vec, the category of (finite dimensional) vector spaces. One call a\nmorphism \u03c6\u2022 from C(A) or from H(A) quasi-isomorphism if all Hn (\u03c6\u2022 ) are\nisomorphisms. Now the derived category D(A) is defined as the category of\nfractions H(A)[Q\u22121 ], where Q is the set of all quasi-isomorphisms.\nOne calls a complex (1) right bounded (left bounded, bounded) if there\nis n0 such that Mn = 0 for n < n0 (respectively, there is n1 such that\nMn = 0 for n > n1 , or there are both). The corresponding categories are\ndenoted by C \u2212 , H\u2212 , D \u2212 (respectively, by C + , H+ , D + , or by C b , Hb , D b ). In\nthis paper we mainly deal with the bounded derived category D b (A). The\ncategory A-mod of (finite dimensional) A-modules naturally embeds into\n\n\fDERIVED TAME AND DERIVED WILD ALGEBRAS\n\n3\n\nD(A) (even in D b (A)): a module M is identified with the complex M\u2022 such\nthat M0 = M, Mn = 0 for n 6= 0.\nSince the category of modules has enough projectives, one can replace,\nwhen considering right bounded homotopic or derived category, arbitrary\ncomplexes by projective ones, i.e. consisting of projective modules only.\nWe denote by P \u2212 (A) and by P b (A) the categories of right bounded and\nbounded projective complexes. Actually, D \u2212 (A) \u2243 H\u2212 (A) \u2243 P \u2212 (A)/Ih ,\nwhere Ih is the ideal of morphisms homotopic to zero [13, 14]. Moreover, in finite dimensional case every module M has a projective cover, i.e.\nthere is an epimorphism p(M ) : P (M ) \u2192 M , where P (M ) is projective,\nsuch that Ker p(M ) \u2286 rad P (M ), the radical of P (M ) [9]. Therefore, one\ncan only consider minimal complexes, i.e. projective complexes such that\n\u2212\n(A) the category of miniIm dn \u2286 rad Pn\u22121 for all n. We denote by Pmin\n\u2212\n\u2212\nmal projective complexes. Thus D (A) \u2243 Pmin (A)/Ih . One immediately\nchecks that the image in D \u2212 (A) of a morphism \u03c6\u2022 of minimal complexes\nis an isomorphism if and only if \u03c6 itself is an isomorphism. Hence, if we\nare interested in classification of objects from D \u2212 (A), we can replace it\n\u2212\n(A). Unfortunately, it is no more the case if we consider D b (A).\nby Pmin\nb (A)/I , since any\nCertainly, if gl.dim A < \u221e, one has that D b (A) \u2243 Pmin\nh\nbounded complex has a bounded projective resolution. On the contrary,\nif gl.dim A = \u221e, it is wrong even for modules. Nevertheless, we propose\nthe following approximation of D b (A), which is enough for classification\npurpose. (Compare it with [16].)\nWe denote by P m (A) the category of bounded projective complexes M\u2022\nsuch that Mn = 0 for n > m (note that the left bound is not prescribed).\nWe say that a morphism \u03c6\u2022 in P m (A) is quasi-homotopic to zero if there\n\u2032\nsuch that \u03c6n = \u03c3n\u22121 dn + d\u2032n+1 \u03c3n for\nare homomorphisms \u03c3k : Mn \u2192 Mn+1\nall n < m. Let Hm (A) = P m (A)/Iqh , where Iqh is the ideal of morphisms\nquasi-homotopic to zero. Especially, if P\u2022 is a minimal complex from P m (A),\nit is isomorphic in Hm (A) to a minimal complex P\u0303\u2022 such that P\u0303n = Pn , d \u0303n =\ndn for n 6= m, while Pm = P\u0303m \u2295 Q so that Q \u2286 Ker dm , d \u0303m = dm |P\u0303m and\nKer d \u0303m \u2286 rad P\u0303m . There is a natural functor Hm (A) \u2192 Hm+1 (A), which\nmaps a complex P\u2022 to the complex P\u2022+ , where Pn+ = Pn , d+\nn = dn for n \u2264 m,\n+\n+\n\u2192\nis\nthe\nepimorphism\np(Ker\ndm ) : Pm+1\n= P (Ker dm ) and d+\nwhile Pm+1\nm+1\nm+1\nm\nKer dm . Conversely, there is a functor H\n(A) \u2192 H (A), which just\nabandon Pm+1 in a complex P\u2022 . One easily verifies the following results.\nProposition 1.1.\n(1) D b (A) \u2243 limm Hm (A);\n\u2212\u2192\n(2) D \u2212 (A) \u2243 limm Hm (A).\n\u2190\u2212\nMoreover, if complexes P\u2022 and P\u2022\u2032 \u2208 P m (A) are minimal, their images in\nb\nD (A) are isomorphic if and only if P\u0303\u2022 \u2243 P\u0303\u2022\u2032 as complexes.\nThus dealing with classification problems, one can deal with Hm or with\ninstead of D b . Note also that if we fix all Hn (P\u2022 ) for a complex from\nm (A), there are finitely many possibilities for the values of P .\nPmin\nn\nTaking into consideration these remarks, one can define derived wild and\nderived tame algebras as follows.\n\nPm\n\n\f4\n\nYURIY A.

For such a family P\u2022 and an R-module L we denote by\nP\u2022 (L) the complex (Pn \u2297R L, dn \u2297 1).

(This value does not depend on the\nchoice of L.)\n(3) An algebra A is called derived tame if there is a set of rational\nfamilies of bounded A-complexes S such that:\n(a) for every (bounded) v\u2022 the set S(v\u2022 ) = { P\u2022 \u2208 S | r\u2022 (P\u2022 ) = v\u2022 }\nis finite.\n(b) for every v\u2022 all indecomposable complexes from P(v\u2022 , A), except finitely many of them (up to isomorphism) are isomorphic\nto a complex P\u2022 (L) for some P\u2022 \u2208 S and some finite dimensional L.\nWe call S a parameterising set of A-complexes.\nThese definitions do not formally coincide with other definitions of derived\ntame and derived wild algebras, for instance, those proposed in [11, 12], but\nall of them are evidently equivalent. It is obvious (and easy to prove) that\n\n\fDERIVED TAME AND DERIVED WILD ALGEBRAS\n\n5\n\nneither algebra can be both derived tame and derived wild. The following result (\"tame-wild dichotomy for derived categories\") has recently been\nproved by V. Bekkert and the author [1].\nTheorem 1.5 (Main Theorem). Every finite dimensional algebra over an\nalgebraically closed field is either derived tame or derived wild.\n2. Reduction to matrix problems\nWe recall now the main notions related to the matrix problems (representations of boxes). More detailed exposition can be found in [6]. A box is a\npair A = (A, V), where A is a (k-linear) category and V is an A-coalgebra,\ni.e. an A-bimodule supplied with comultiplication \u03bc : V \u2192 V \u2297A V and\ncounit \u03b9 : V \u2192 A, which are homomorphisms of A-bimodules and satisfy\nthe usual coalgebra conditions\n(\u03bc \u2297 1)\u03bc = (1 \u2297 \u03bc)\u03bc,\n\nil (\u03b9 \u2297 1)\u03bc = ir (1 \u2297 \u03b9)\u03bc = id,\n\nwhere il : A \u2297A V \u2243 V and ir : V \u2297A A \u2243 V are the natural isomorphisms.\nThe kernel V = Ker \u03b9 is called the kernel of the box. A representation of such\na box in a category C is a functor M : A \u2192 C. Given another representation\nN : A \u2192 C, a morphism f : M \u2192 N is defined as a homomorphism of Amodules V \u2297A M \u2192 N , or, equivalently, as a homomorphism of A-bimodules\nV \u2192 HomC (M, N ), the latter supplied with the obvious A-bimodule structure. The composition gf of f : M \u2192 N and g : N \u2192 L is defined as the\ncomposition\n1\u2297f\n\n\u03bc\u22971\n\ng\n\nV \u2297A M \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 V \u2297A V \u2297A M \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 V \u2297A N \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 L,\nwhile the identity morphism idM of M is the composition\ni\n\n\u03b9\u22971\n\nV \u2297A M \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 A \u2297A M \u2212\u2212\u2212l\u2212\u2192 M.\nThus we obtain the category of representations Rep(A, C). If C = vec, we\njust write Rep(A). If f is a morphism and \u03b3 \u2208 V(a, b), we denote by f (\u03b3)\nthe morphism f (b)(\u03b3 \u2297 ) : M (a) \u2192 N (a). A box A is called normal (or\ngroup-like) if there is a set of elements \u03c9 = { \u03c9a \u2208 V(a, a) | a \u2208 ob A } such\nthat \u03b9(\u03c9a ) = 1a and \u03bc(\u03c9a ) = \u03c9a \u2297 \u03c9a for every a \u2208 ob A. In this case, if f is\nan isomorphism, all morphisms f (\u03c9a ) are isomorphisms M (a) \u2243 N (a). This\nset is called a section of A. For a normal box, one defines the differentials\n\u22020 : A \u2192 V and \u22021 : V \u2192 V \u2297A V setting\n\u22020 (\u03b1) = \u03b1\u03c9a \u2212 \u03c9b \u03b1\n\nfor \u03b1 \u2208 A(a, b);\n\n\u22021 (\u03b3) = \u03bc(\u03b3) \u2212 \u03b3 \u2297 \u03c9a \u2212 \u03c9b \u2297 \u03b3\n\nfor \u03b3 \u2208 V(a, b).\n\nUsually we omit indices, writing \u2202\u03b1 and \u2202\u03b3.\nRecall that a free category k\u0393, where \u0393 is an oriented graph, has the vertices of \u0393 as its objects and the paths from a to b (a, b being two vertices) as a\nbasis of the vector space k\u0393(a, b). A semi-free category is a category of fractions k\u0393[S \u22121 ], where S = { g\u03b1 (\u03b1) | \u03b1 runs through a set of loops } (called\nthe marked loops) of the graph \u0393. The arrows of \u0393 are called the free (respectively, semi-free) generators of the free (semi-free) category. A normal\nbox A = (A, V) is called free (semi-free) if such is the category A, moreover,\nthe kernel V = Ker \u03b9 of the box is a free A -bimodule and \u2202\u03b1 = 0 for each\n\n\f6\n\nYURIY A. DROZD\n\nmarked loop \u03b1. A set of free (respectively, semi-free) generators of such a\nbox is a union S = S0 \u222a S1 , where S0 is a set of free (semi-free) generators of\nthe category A and S1 is a set of free generators of the A-bimodule V. A set\nof free (or semi-free) generators S is called triangular if there is a function\n\u033a : S \u2192 N (we call it \"weight\") such that, for every \u03b1 \u2208 S, the differential\n\u2202\u03b1 belongs to the sub-box generated by { \u03b2 \u2208 S | \u033a(\u03b2) < \u033a(\u03b1) }; especially, if\n\u033a(\u03b1) = 0, \u03b1 is minimal, i.e. \u2202\u03b1 = 0. A free (semi-free) box having a triangular set of free (semi-free) generators is called triangular. For a triangular\nbox a morphism of representations f : M \u2192 N is an isomorphism if and\nonly if all f (\u03c9a ) are isomorphisms. In what follows we always suppose that\nour graphs are locally finite, i.e. only have finitely many arrows starting or\nending at a given vertex. If such a graph \u0393 has no oriented cycles, then the\ncategory k\u0393 is locally finite dimensional, i.e. all its spaces of morphisms are\nfinite dimensional.\nWe call a category A trivial if it is a free category generated by a trivial\ngraph (i.e. one with no arrows); thus A(a, b) = 0 if a 6= b and A(a, a) = k.\nWe call A minimal, if it is a semi-free category with a set of semi-free\ngenerators consisting of loops only, at most one loop at each vertex. Thus\nA(a, b) = 0 again if a 6= b, while A(a, a) is either k or a rational algebra.\nWe call a normal box A = (A, V) so-trivial if A is trivial, and so-minimal if\nA is minimal and all its loops \u03b1 are minimal too (i.e. with \u2202\u03b1 = 0).\nIn [5] (cf. also [6]) the classification of representations of an arbitrary finite\ndimensional algebra was reduced to representations of a free triangular box.\nTo deal with derived categories we have to consider a wider class of boxes.\nFirst, a factor-box of a box A = (A, V) modulo an ideal I \u2286 A is defined\nas the box A/I = (A/I, V/(IV + VI) (with obvious comultiplication and\ncounit). Note that if A is normal, so is A/I.\nDefinition 2.1. A sliced box is a factor-box A/I, where A = (A, V) is\nS a free\nbox such that the set of its objects V = ob A is a disjoint union V = i\u2208Z Vi\nsuch that A(a, b) = 0 if a \u2208 Vi , b \u2208 Vj with j > i, A(a, a) = k, and\nV(a, b) = 0 if a \u2208 Vi , b \u2208 Vj with i 6= j. WeScall a sliced box A/I triangular\nif so is the free box A. The partition V = i Vi is called a slicing.\n\nCertainly, in this definition we may assume that the elements of the ideal\nI are linear combinations of paths of length at least 2. Otherwise such an\nelement is a linear combination of arrows, so we can just eliminate one of\nthese arrows from the underlying graph.\nNote that for every representation M \u2208 Rep(A), where A is a free (semifree, sliced) box with the set of objects V, one can consider its dimension\nDim(M ), which is a function V \u2192 N, namely Dim(M )(a) = dim M (a).\nWe call such a representation finite dimensional if its support supp M =\n{ a \u2208 V | M (a) 6= 0 } is finite and denote by rep(A) the category of finite\ndimensional representations. Having these notions, one can easily reproduce\nthe definitions of families of representations, especially strict families, wild\nand tame boxes; see [5, 6] for details. The following procedure, mostly\nmodelling that of [5], let us replace derived categories by representations of\nsliced boxes.\nLet A be a finite dimensional algebra, J be its radical. As far as we\nare interested in A-modules and complexes, we can replace A by a Morita\n\n\fDERIVED TAME AND DERIVED WILD ALGEBRAS\n\n7\n\nP\nequivalent reduced algebra, thus suppose that A/J \u2243 ks [9]. Let 1 = si=1 ,\nwhere ei are primitive orthogonal idempotents; set Aji = ej Aei and Jji =\nej Jei ; note that Jji = Aji if i 6= j. We denote by S the trivial category\nwith the set of objects { (i, n) | n \u2208 N, i = 1, 2, . . . , s } and consider the Sbimodule J such that\n(\n\u0001\n0\nif m 6= n \u2212 1,\nJ (i, n), (j, m) =\n\u2217\nJji if m = n \u2212 1.\n\nLet B = S[J ] be the tensor category of this bimodule; equivalently, it is the\nfree category having\n\u0001 the same set of objects as S and the union of bases of\nall J (i, n), (j, m) as a set of free generators. Denote by U the S-bimodule\nsuch that\n(\n\u0001\n0\nif n 6= m,\nU (i, n), (j, m) =\n\u2217\nAji if n = m\nf = B \u2297S U \u2297S B. Dualizing the multiplication Akj \u2297 Aji \u2192 Aki ,\nand set W\nwe get homomorphisms\nf\n\u03bbr :B \u2192 B \u2297S W,\nf \u2297S B,\n\u03bbl :B \u2192 W\n\nf\u2192W\nf \u2297S W.\nf\n\u03bc\u0303 :W\n\nf a structure of B-coalgebra. Moreover, the\nIn particular, \u03bc\u0303 defines on W\nf i.e. \u03bc\u0303(W0 ) \u2286\nsub-bimodule W0 generated by Im(\u03bbr \u2212 \u03bbl ) is a coideal in W,\nf\nf\nf\nW0 \u2297B W \u2295 W \u2297B W0 . Therefore, W = W/W0 is also a B-coalgebra, so we\nget a box B = (B, W). One easily checks that it is free and triangular.\nDualizing multiplication also gives a mapping\ns\nM\n(3)\n\u03bd : J\u2217ji \u2192\nJ\u2217jk \u2297 J\u2217ki .\nk=1\n\nNamely, if we choose bases { \u03b1 } , { \u03b2 } { \u03b3 } in the spaces, respectively, Jji ,\nJjk , Jki , and dual bases { \u03b1\u2217 } , { \u03b2 \u2217 } , { \u03b3 \u2217 } in their duals, then \u03b2 \u2217 \u2297 \u03b3 \u2217\noccurs in \u03bd(\u03b1\u2217 ) with the same coefficient as \u03b1 occurs in \u03b2\u03b3. Note\nthat\n\u0001\nthe right-hand space in (3) coincide with each B (i, n), (j, n \u2212 2) . Let I\nbe the ideal in B generated by the images of \u03bd in all these spaces and\nD = B/I = (A, V), where A = B/I, V = W/(IW + WI). If necessary, we\nwrite D(A) to emphasise that this box has been constructed from a given\nalgebra A. Certainly, D is a sliced triangular box, and the following result\nholds.\nTheorem 2.2. The category of finite dimensional representations rep(D(A))\nb (A) of bounded minimal projective Ais equivalent to the category Pmin\ncomplexes.\nProof. Let Ai = Aei ; they form a complete list of non-isomorphic indecomposable projective A-modules; set also Ji = rad Ai = Jei . Then\nHomA (Ai , Jj ) \u2243 Jji .

Moreover, one easily verifies that the condition (4) is\nequivalent to the relation\nLs dn dn+1 = 0. Since every projective A-module can\nbe given in the form i=1 Ai \u2297 Vi for some uniquely defined vector spaces\nVi , we get a one-to-one correspondence between finite dimensional representations of D and bounded minimal complexes of projective A-modules. In\nthe same way one also establishes one-to-one correspondence between morphisms of representations and of the corresponding complexes, compatible\nwith their multiplication, which accomplishes the proof.\n\u0003\nCorollary 2.3. An algebra A is derived tame (derived wild) if so is the box\nD(A).\n3. Proof of the main theorem\nNow we are able to prove the main theorem. Namely, according to Corollary 2.3, it follows from the analogous result for sliced boxes.\nTheorem 3.1. Every sliced triangular box is either tame or wild.\nActually, just as in [5] (see also [6]), we shall prove this theorem in the\nfollowing form.\nTheorem 3.1a. Suppose that a sliced triangular box A = (A, V) is not\nwild. For every dimension d of its representations there is a functor Fd :\nA \u2192 M, where M is a minimal category, such that every representation\nM : A \u2192 vec of A of dimension Dim(M ) \u2264 d is isomorphic to the inverse\nimage F \u2217 N = N \u25e6 F for some functor N : M \u2192 vec. Moreover, F can be\n\n\fDERIVED TAME AND DERIVED WILD ALGEBRAS\n\n9\n\nchosen strict, which means that F \u2217 N \u2243 F \u2217 N \u2032 implies N \u2243 N \u2032 and F \u2217 N is\nindecomposable if so is N .\nRemark. We can consider the induced box AF = (M, M \u2297A V \u2297A M). It\nis a so-minimal box, and F \u2217 defines a full and faithful functor rep(AF ) \u2192\nrep(A). Its image consists of all representations M : A \u2192 vec that factorise\nthrough F .\nProof. As we only consider finite dimensional representations, we\nS may assume that the set of objects is finite.\nHence the slicing V = i Vi (see\nS\nDefinition 2.1) is finite too: V = m\nV\ni=1 i and we use induction by m. If\nm = 1, A is free, and our claim has been proved in [5]. So we may suppose\nthat the theorem is true for smaller values of m, especially, itSis true for the\nrestriction A\u2032 = (A\u2032 , V \u2032 ) of the box A onto the subset V\u2032 = m\ni=2 Vi . Thus\n\u2032\n\u2032\nthere is a strict functor F : A \u2192 M, where M is a minimal category, such\nthat every representation of A\u2032 of dimension smaller than d is of the form\nF \u2032\nF \u2032 \u2217 N for N : M \u2192 vec. Consider now the amalgamation B = A A M\nand the box B = (B, W), where W = B \u2297A V \u2297A B. The functor F \u2032 extends to a functor F : A \u2192 B and induces a homomorphism of A-bimodules\nV \u2192 W; so it defines a functor F \u2217 : rep(B) \u2192 rep(A), which is full and\nfaithful. Moreover, every representation of A of dimension smaller than d is\nisomorphic to F \u2217 N for some N , and all possible dimensions of such N are\nrestricted by some vector b. Therefore, it is enough to prove the claim of\nthe theorem for the box B.\nNote that the category B is generated by the loops from M and the images\nof arrows from A(a, b) with b \u2208 V1 (we call them new arrows). It implies\nthat\nP\nall possible relations between these morphisms are of the form \u03b2 \u03b2g\u03b2 (\u03b1),\nwhere \u03b1 \u2208 B(a, a) is a loop (necessarily minimal, i.e. with \u2202\u03b1 = 0), g\u03b2\nare some polynomials, and \u03b2 runs through the set of new arrows from a to\nb for\nb; let them\n\u0001\nP some b \u2208 V1 . Consider all of these relations for a fixed\nbe \u03b2 \u03b2g\u03b2,k (\u03b1). Their coefficients form a matrix g\u03b2,k (\u03b1) . Making linear\ntransformations of the set { \u03b2 } and of the set of relations, we can make\nthis matrix diagonal, i.e. make all relations being \u03b2f\u03b2 (\u03b1) = 0 for some\npolynomials f\u03b2 . If one of f\u03b2 is zero, the box B has a sub-box\n\u03b1\n\n9a\n\n\u03b2\n\n/b,\n\nwith \u2202\u03b1 = \u2202\u03b2 = 0, which is wild; hence B and A are also wild. Otherwise,\nlet f (\u03b1) 6= 0 be a common multiple of all f\u03b2 (\u03b1), \u039b = { \u03bb1 , \u03bb2 , . . . , \u03bbr } be the\nset of roots of f (\u03b1). If N \u2208 rep(B) is such that N (\u03b1) has no eigenvalues\nfrom \u039b, then f (N (\u03b1)) is invertible; thus N (\u03b2) = 0 for all \u03b2 : a \u2192 b. So\nwe can apply the reduction of the loop \u03b1 with respect to the set \u039b and the\ndimension d = b(a), as in [5, Propositions 3,4] or [6, Theorem 6.4]. It gives a\nnew box that has the same number of loops as B, but the loop corresponding\nto \u03b1 is \"isolated,\" i.e. there are no more arrows starting or ending at the\nsame vertex. In the same way we are able to isolate all loops, obtaining a\nsemi-free triangular box C and a morphism G : B \u2192 C such that G\u2217 is full\nand faithful and all representations of B of dimensions smaller than b are\nof the form G\u2217 L. As the theorem is true for semi-free boxes, it accomplishes\nthe proof.\n\u0003\n\n\f10\n\nYURIY A. DROZD\n\nRemark. Applying reduction functors, like in the proof above, we can also\nextend to sliced boxes (thus to derived categories) other results obtained\nbefore for free boxes. For instance, we mention the following theorem, quite\nanalogous to that of Crawley-Boevey [3].\nTheorem 3.2. If an algebra A is derived tame, then, for any vector d =\n(dn | n \u2208 Z) such that almost all dn = 0, there is at most finite set of generic\nA-complexes of endolength d, i.e. such indecomposable minimal bounded\ncomplexes P\u2022 of projective A-modules, not all of which are finitely generated,\nthat lengthE (Pn ) = dn for all n, where E = EndA (P\u2022 ).\nIts proof reproduces again that of [3], with obvious changes necessary to\ninclude sliced boxes into consideration.\n4. Families of complexes\nWe consider now algebraic families of A-complexes, i.e. flat families over\nan algebraic variety X. Such a family is a complex F\u2022 = (Fn , dn ) of flat coherent A\u2297OX -modules. We always assume this complex bounded and minimal; the latter means that Im dn \u2286 JFn\u22121 for all n, where J = rad A. We\nalso assume that X is connected; it implies that the vector rank r\u2022 (F\u2022 (x))\nis constant, so we can call it the vector rank of the family F and denote\nit by r\u2022 (F\u2022 ) Here, as usually, F(x) = Fx /mx Fx , where mx is the maximal\nideal of the ring OX,x . We call a family F\u2022 non-degenerate if, for every\nx \u2208 X, at least one of dn (x) : Fn (x) \u2192 Fn\u22121 (x) is non-zero. Having a\nfamily F\u2022 over X and a regular mapping \u03c6 : Y \u2192 X, one gets the inverse\nimage \u03c6\u2217 (F), which is a family of A-complexes over the variety Y such that\n\u03c6\u2217 (F)(y) \u2243 F(\u03c6(y)). If F\u2022 is non-degenerate, so is \u03c6\u2217 (F). Given an ideal\nI \u2286 J, we call a family F\u2022 an I-family if Im dn \u2286 IFn\u22121 for all n. Then any\ninverse image \u03c6\u2217 (F) is an I-family as well. Just as in [8], we construct some\n\"almost versal\" non-degenerate I-families.\nConsider again a complete set of non-isomorphic indecomposable projective A-modules\n{ A1 , A2 , . . . , As }. For each vector r = (r1 , r2 , . . . , rs ) set\nLs\n\u2032\n\u2032\nrA =\nr\nA\ni=1 i i , and denote I(r, r ) = HomA (rA, I * r A), where I is an\nideal contained in J. Fix a vector\nL rank of bounded complexes r\u2022 = (rk | m \u2264\nk \u2264 n) and set H = H(r, I) = nk=m+1 I(rk , rk\u22121 ). Consider the projective\nspace P = P(r\u2022 , I) = P(H) and its closed subset D = D(r\u2022 , I) \u2286 P consisting of all sequences (hk ) such that hk+1 hk = 0 for all k. Because of the\nuniversal property of projective spaces [15, Theorem II.7.1], the embedding\nD(r\u2022 , I) \u2192 P(r\u2022 , I) gives rise to a non-degenerate I-family V\u2022 = V\u2022 (r\u2022 , I):\n(5)\n\nV\u2022 :\n\nd\n\ndn\u22121\n\nVn \u2212\u2212\u2212n\u2212\u2192 Vn\u22121 \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 . . . \u2212\u2192 Vm ,\n\nwhere Vk = OD (n \u2212 k) \u2297 rk A for all m \u2264 k \u2264 n. We call V\u2022 (r\u2022 , I) the\ncanonical I-family of A-complexes over D(r\u2022 , I). Moreover, regular mappings \u03c6 : X \u2192 D(r\u2022 , I) correspond to non-degenerate I-families F\u2022 with\nFk = 0 for k > n or k < m and Fk = L\u2297(n\u2212k) \u2297 rk A for some invertible\nsheaf L over X. Namely, such a family can be obtained as \u03c6\u2217 (V\u2022 ) for a\nuniquely defined regular mapping \u03c6. Moreover, the following result holds,\nwhich shows the \"almost versality\" of the families V\u2022 (r\u2022 , I).\n\n\fDERIVED TAME AND DERIVED WILD ALGEBRAS\n\n11\n\nProposition 4.1. For every non-degenerate family of I-complexes F\u2022 of\nvectorSrank r\u2022 over an algebraic variety X, there is a finite open covering\nX = j Uj such that the restriction of F\u2022 onto each Uj is isomorphic to\n\u03c6\u2217j V\u2022 (r\u2022 , I) for a regular mapping \u03c6j : Uj \u2192 D(r\u2022 , I).\nProof. For each x \u2208 X there is an open neighbourhood U \u220b x such that\nall restrictions Fk |U are isomorphic to OU \u2297 rk A; so the restriction F\u2022 |U\nis obtained from a regular mapping U \u2192 D(r\u2022 , I). Evidently it implies the\nassertion.\n\u0003\nNote that the mappings \u03c6j are not canonical, so we cannot glue them into\na \"global\" mapping X \u2192 D(r\u2022 , I).\nQ\nConsider now the group G = G(r\u2022 ) =\nk Aut(rk A), which acts on\nH(r\u2022 , I): (gk )*(hk ) = (gk\u22121 hk gk\u22121 ). It induces the action of G(r\u2022 ) on P(R\u2022 , I)\nand on D(r\u2022 , I). The definitions immediately imply that V\u2022 (r\u2022 , I)(x) \u2243\nV\u2022 (r\u2022 , I)(x\u2032 ) (x, x\u2032 \u2208 D) if and only if x and x\u2032 belong to the same orbit\nof G. Consider the sets\nDi = Di (r\u2022 , I) = { x \u2208 D | dim Gx \u2264 i } .\nIt is known that they are closed (it follows from the theorem on dimensions\nof fibres, cf. [15, Exercise II.3.22] or [17, Ch. I, \u00a7 6, Theorem 7]). We set\npar(r\u2022 , I, A) = max { dim Di (r\u2022 , I) \u2212 i }\ni\n\nand call this integer the parameter number of I-complexes of vector rank\nr\u2022 . Obviously, if I \u2286 I\u2032 , then par(r\u2022 , I, A) \u2264 par(r\u2022 , I\u2032 , A). Especially, the\nnumber par(r\u2022 , A) = par(r\u2022 , J, A) is the biggest one.\nProposition 4.1, together with the theorem on the dimensions of fibres and\nthe Chevalley theorem on the image of a regular mapping (cf. [15, Exercise\nII.3.19] or [17, Ch. I, \u00a7 5, Theorem 6]), implies the following result.\nCorollary 4.2. Let F\u2022 be an I-family of vector rank r\u2022 over a variety X.\nFor each x \u2208 X set Xx = { x\u2032 \u2208 X | F\u2022 (x\u2032 ) \u2243 F\u2022 (x) } and denote\nXi = { x \u2208 X | dim Xx \u2264 i } ,\npar(F\u2022 ) = max { dim Xi \u2212 i } .\ni\n\nThen all subsets Xx and Xi are constructible (i.e. finite unions of locally\nclosed sets) and par(F\u2022 ) \u2264 par(r\u2022 , I, A).\nNote that the bases D(r\u2022 , I) of our almost versal families are projective,\nespecially complete varieties. In the next section we shall exploit this property.\nTame-wild dichotomy allows to establish the derived type of an algebra knowing the behaviour of\nP the numbers par(r\u2022 , A). Namely, if rk =\n(rk1 , rk2 , . . . , rks ), set |r\u2022 | = k,i rki . Since it is a maximal possible number of indecomposable summands of complexes of vector rank r\u2022 , indecomposable complexes over derived tame algebra form at most one-parameter\nfamilies, and the parameter number grows quadratically for derived wild\nalgebras, the following corollary is evident.\nCorollary 4.3. An algebra A is derived tame if and only if par(r\u2022 , A) \u2264 |r\u2022 |\nfor all vector ranks r\u2022 .\n\n\f12\n\nYURIY A. DROZD\n\nAn important case is that of families of free modules, i.e. such that\nFk (x) \u2243 ak A for some integer k. Namely, let r(A) = (a1 , a2 , . . . , as )\n(we do not suppose that A is Morita reduced). For every vector b =\n(bm , bm+1 , . . . , bn ) we set ba = (bm a, bm+1 a, . . . , bn a) and write D(b, I),\npar(b, I, A), etc. instead of, respectively, D(ba, I), par(ba, I, A), etc. When\nwe are interested in the asymptotical behaviour of parameter numbers (it is\nenough, for instance, to establish the derived type), we can restrict our considerations by free complexes only. Indeed, for a vector r = (r1 , r2 , . . . , rs ),\ndenote\n\u0002\n\u0003\nr/a = max { b | bai \u2264 ri for all i } ,\n\u0003\n\u0002\nr/a = min { b | bai \u2265 ri for all i } .\nIf r\u2022 = (rm , rm+1 , . . . , rn ), set\n\nb = (bm , bm+1 , . . . , bn ),\nb\u2032 = (b\u2032m , b\u2032m+1 , . . . , b\u2032n ),\nThen, obviously,\n\n\u0003\n\u0002\nwhere bk = rk /a ;\n\u0003\n\u0002\nwhere b\u2032k = rk /a .\n\npar(b\u2032 a, I, A) \u2264 par(r\u2022 , I, A) \u2264 par(b, I, A).\nEspecially, Corollary 4.3 can be reformulated as follows.\nCorollary 4.4. An algebra A is derived tame if and only if par(b, A) \u2264\n|b| dim A for every sequence b = (bm , bm+1 , . . . , bn ).\n5. Families of algebras. Semi-continuity\nA (flat) family of algebras over an algebraic variety X is a sheaf A of\nOX -algebras, which is coherent and flat (thus locally free) as a sheaf of OX modules. For such a family and every sequence b = (bm , bm+1 , . . . , bn ) one\ncan define the function par(b, A, x) = par(b, A(x)). (Recall that here bk\ndenote the ranks of free modules in a free complex.) Our main result is the\nupper semi-continuity of these functions.\nTheorem 5.1. Let A be a flat family of finite dimensional algebras over an\nalgebraic variety X. For every vector b = (bm , bm+1 , . . . , bn ) the function\npar(b, A, x) is upper semi-continuous, i.e. all sets\nXj = { x \u2208 X | par(b, A, x) \u2265 j }\nare closed.\nProof. We may assume that X is irreducible. Let K be the field of rational\nfunctions on X. We consider it as a constant sheaf on X. Set J = rad(A\u2297OX\nK) and J = R \u2229 A. It is a sheaf of nilpotent ideals. Moreover, if \u03be is the\ngeneric point of X, the factor algebra A(\u03be)/J (\u03be) is semisimple. Hence there\nis an open set U \u2286 X such that A(x)/J (x) is semisimple, thus J (x) =\nrad A(x) for every x \u2208 U . Therefore par(b, A, x) = par(b, J (x), A(x)) for\nx \u2208 U ; so Xj = Xj (J ) \u222a Xj\u2032 , where\nXj (J ) = { x \u2208 X | par(b, J (x), A(x)) \u2265 j }\nX\u2032\n\nand\n= X \\U is a closed subset in X. Using noetherian induction, we may\nsuppose that Xj\u2032 is closed, so we only have to prove that Xj (J ) is closed\ntoo.\n\n\fDERIVED TAME AND DERIVED WILD ALGEBRAS\n\n13\n\nL\nConsider the locally free sheaf H = nk=m+1 Hom(bk A, bk\u22121 J ) and the\nprojective space bundle P(H) [15, Section II.7]. Every point h \u2208 P(H) defines a set of homomorphisms hk : bk A(x) \u2192 bk\u22121 J (x) (up to a homothety),\nwhere x is the image of h in X, and the points h such that hk hk+1 = 0 form\na closed subset D \u2286 P(H). We denote by \u03c0 the restriction onto D of the\nprojection P(H) \u2192 X; it is a projective, hence closed mapping. Moreover,\nfor every point x \u2208 X the fibre \u03c0 \u22121 (x) is isomorphic\nQn to D(b, A(x), J (x)).\nConsider also the group variety G over X: G = k=m GLbk (A). There is a\nnatural action of G on D over X, and the sets Di = { z \u2208 D | dim Gz \u2264 i }\nare closed\nin X, as well as\n\b in D. Therefore the sets Zi = \u03c0(Di ) are closed\nS\nZij = x \u2208 Zi | dim \u03c0 \u22121 (x) \u2265 i + j . But Xj (J ) = i Zij , thus it is also a\nclosed set.\n\u0003\nTaking into consideration Corollary 4.4, we obtain\nCorollary 5.2. For a family of algebras A over X denote\nXtame = { x \u2208 X | A(x) is derived tame } ,\nXwild = { x \u2208 X | A(x) is derived wild } .\nThen Xtame is a countable intersection of open subsets and Xwild is a countable union of closed subsets.\nThe following conjecture seems very plausible, though even its analogue\nfor usual tame algebras has not yet been proved.\nConjecture 5.3. For any (flat) family of algebras over an algebraic variety\nX the set Xtame is open.\nRecall that an algebra A is said to be a (flat) degeneration of an algebra\nB, and B is said to be a (flat) deformation of A, if there is a (flat) family\nof algebras A over an algebraic variety X and a point p \u2208 X such that\nA(x) \u2243 B for all x 6= p, while A(p) \u2243 A. One easily verifies that we can\nalways assume X to be a non-singular curve. Corollary 5.2 obviously implies\nCorollary 5.4. Suppose that an algebra A is a flat degeneration of an\nalgebra B. If B is derived wild, so is A. If A is derived tame, so is B.\nIf we consider non-flat families, the situation can completely change. The\nreason is that the dimension is no more constant in these families. That is\nwhy it can happen that such a \"degeneration\" of a derived wild algebra may\nbecome derived tame, as the following example due to Br\u00fcstle [2] shows.\nExample 5.5. There is a (non-flat) family of algebras A over an affine line\nA1 such that all of them except A(0) are isomorphic to the derived wild\nalgebra B given by the quiver with relations\n\u2022O\n\u03b31\n\n\u2022\n\n\u03b1\n\n/\u2022\n\n\u03b21\n\n/\u2022o\n\u03b32\n\n\u000f\n\n\u2022\n\n\u03b22\n\n\u2022\n\n\u03b21 \u03b1 = 0,\n\n\f14\n\nYURIY A. DROZD\n\nwhile A(0) is isomorphic to the derived tame algebra A given by the quiver\nwith relations\n@ \u2022O\n\u0001\n\u0001\u0001 \u03b3\n\u0001\n1\n\u0001\u0001\n\u0001\u0001\u03b21\n/ \u2022 o \u03b22\n/\u2022\n\u03be1\n\n(6)\n\n\u2022\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u03b32\n\n\u0001\u0001\n\u0001\u0001\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u000f \u0001\u0001 \u03be2\n\n\u2022\n\n\u03b21 \u03b1 = \u03b31 \u03b21 = \u03b32 \u03b22 = 0.\n\n\u2022\n\nNamely, one has to define A(\u03bb) as the factor algebra of the path algebra of\nthe quiver as in (6), but with the relations \u03b21 \u03b1 = 0, \u03b31 \u03b21 = \u03bb\u03be1 , \u03b32 \u03b22 = \u03bb\u03be2 .\nNote that dim A = 16 and dim B = 15, which shows that this family is not\nflat.\nActually, in such a situation the following result always holds.\nProposition 5.6. Let A be a family (not necessarily flat) of algebras over\na non-singular curve X such that A(x) \u2243 B for all x 6= p, where p is a\nfixed point, while A(p) \u2243 A. Then there is a flat family B over X such that\nB(x) \u2243 B for all x 6= p and B(p) \u2243 A/I for some ideal I.\nProof. Note that the restriction of A onto U = X\\{ p } is flat, since dim A(x)\nis constant there. Let n = dim B, \u0393 be the quiver of the algebra B and\nG = k\u0393 be the path algebra of \u0393. Consider the Grassmannian Gr(n, G),\ni.e. the variety of subspaces of codimension n of G. The ideals form a\nclosed subset Alg = Alg(n, G) \u2282 Gr(n, G). The restriction of the canonical\nvector bundle V over the Grassmannian onto Alg is a sheaf of ideals in\nG = G\u2297OAlg , and the factor F = G/V is a universal family of factor algebras\nof G of dimension n. Therefore there is a morphism \u03c6 : U \u2192 Alg such that\nthe restriction of A onto U is isomorphic to \u03c6\u2217 (F). Since Alg is projective\nand X is non-singular, \u03c6 can be continued to a morphism \u03c8 : X \u2192 Alg.\nLet B = \u03c8 \u2217 (F); it is a flat family of algebras over X. Moreover, B coincides\nwith A outside p. Since both of them are coherent sheaves on a non-singular\ncurve and B is locally free, it means that B \u2243 A/T , where T is the torsion\npart of A, and B(p) \u2243 A(p)/T (p).\n\u0003\nCorollary 5.7. If a degeneration of a derived wild algebra is derived tame,\nthe latter has a derived wild factor algebra.\nIn the Br\u00fcstle's example 5.5, to obtain a derived wild factor algebra of\nA, one has to add the relation \u03be1 \u03b1 = 0, which obviously holds in B.\nBy the way, as a factor algebra of a tame algebra is obviously tame (which\nis no more true for derived tame algebras!), we get the following corollary\n(cf. also [4, 8]).\nCorollary 5.8. Any deformation (not necessarily flat) of a tame algebra is\ntame. Any degeneration of a wild algebra is wild.\nReferences\n[1] Bekkert, V. I. and Drozd, Yu. A.
