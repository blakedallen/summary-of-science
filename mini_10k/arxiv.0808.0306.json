Introduction and results\nThe notion of \u0393\u2013symmetric spaces introduced by Lutz [13] is a generalization of the classical\nnotion of a symmetric space.\nDefinition 1.1. Let \u0393 be a finite abelian group and let G be a connected Lie group. A homogeneous\nspace G/K is called \u0393\u2013symmetric if G acts almost effectively on G/K and there is an injective\nhomomorphism \u03c1 : \u0393 \u2192 Aut G, such that G\u03930 \u2286 K \u2286 G\u0393 , where G\u0393 is the subgroup of elements\nfixed by \u03c1(\u0393) and G\u03930 its connected component.\nIn the case \u0393 = Z2 this is just the classical definition of symmetric spaces, in case \u0393 = Zk one\nobtains k\u2013symmetric spaces, as studied in [6]. In case \u0393 = Z2 \u00d7 Z2 we can rephrase the definition\nas follows. A homogeneous space G/K is Z2 \u00d7 Z2 \u2013symmetric if and only if there are two different\ncommuting involutions on G, i.e. there are \u03c3, \u03c4 \u2208 Aut G \\ {idG } such that \u03c3 2 = \u03c4 2 = idG , \u03c3 6= \u03c4\nand \u03c3\u03c4 = \u03c4 \u03c3 such that (G\u03c3 \u2229 G\u03c4 )0 \u2286 K \u2286 G\u03c3 \u2229 G\u03c4 .\nIt is the purpose of this paper to give a classification of Z2 \u00d7 Z2 \u2013symmetric spaces in case G is\na simply connected compact Lie group of isomorphism type Spin(8), E6 , E7 , E8 , F4 or G2 . This\namounts to a classification of pairs of commuting involutions on the Lie algebras of these groups.\nRecently, such a classification has been obtained by Bahturin and Goze [1] for the case of simple\nclassical Lie algebras except so(8). The results of the classification in the exceptional and Spin(8)\ncase are given in Theorems 1.2 and 1.3, respectively, below.\nLet G/K be a Z2 \u00d7 Z2 \u2013symmetric space. Then there is a triple of involutions \u03c3, \u03c4 , \u03c3\u03c4 of G\nand we say that the Z2 \u00d7 Z2 \u2013symmetric space is of type (X, Y, Z) where X, Y , Z denote the local\nisomorphism classes of the symmetric spaces G/G\u03c3 , G/G\u03c4 and G/G\u03c3\u03c4 , respectively. For example,\nwe will show that there are two commuting involutions \u03c3, \u03c4 on G = E7 such that G/G\u03c3 , G/G\u03c4\nand G/G\u03c3\u03c4 are isomorphic to symmetric spaces of type E V, E VI and E VII, respectively and such\nthat the Lie algebra of E\u03c36 \u2229 E\u03c46 is isomorphic to su(6) + sp(1) + R, cf. Table 2. Thus we say that the\ncorresponding Z2 \u00d7 Z2 \u2013symmetric space is of type (E V, E VI, E VII), abbreviated as E V-VI-VII.\nThe problem of commuting involutions has a geometric interpretation in terms of classical Z2 \u2013\nsymmetric spaces. Let G be a simple compact connected Lie group and let H, L be symmetric\nsubgroups of G (see Definition 2.1 below) such that (G\u03c3 )0 \u2286 H \u2286 G\u03c3 and (G\u03c4 )0 \u2286 L \u2286 G\u03c4 ,\nwhere \u03c3, \u03c4 \u2208 Aut(G) are involutions. Then M = G/L endowed with a left G-invariant metric\nis a symmetric space in the classical sense and there is a natural isometric action of H on M\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. 53C30, 53C35; 17B40.\nKey words and phrases. exceptional Z2 \u00d7 Z2 \u2013symmetric space, Lie algebra grading.\n1\n\n\fType\n\ng\n\nk\n\nE I-I-II\nE I-I-III\nE I-II-IV\nE II-II-II\nE II-II-III\nE II-III-III\nE III-III-III\nE III-IV-IV\nE V-V-V\nE V-V-VI\nE V-V-VII\nE V-VI-VII\nE VI-VI-VI\n\ne6\ne6\ne6\ne6\ne6\ne6\ne6\ne6\ne7\ne7\ne7\ne7\ne7\ne7\ne7\ne7\ne8\ne8\ne8\ne8\nf4\nf4\nf4\ng2\n\nso(6) + R\nsp(2) + sp(2)\nsp(3) + sp(1)\nsu(3) + su(3) + R + R\nsu(4) + sp(1) + sp(1) + R\nsu(5) + R + R\nso(8) + R + R\nso(9)\nso(8)\nsu(4) + su(4) + R\nsp(4)\nsu(6) + sp(1) + R\nso(8) + so(4) + sp(1)\nu(6) + R\nso(10) + R + R\nf4\nso(8) + so(8)\nsu(8) + R\nso(12) + sp(1) + sp(1)\ne6 + R + R\nu(3) + R\nsp(2) + sp(1) + sp(1)\nso(8)\nR+R\n\nE VI-VII-VII\nE VII-VII-VII\nE VIII-VIII-VIII\nE VIII-VIII-IX\nE VIII-IX-IX\nE IX-IX-IX\nF I-I-I\nF I-I-II\nF II-II-II\nG\n\nTable 1.

These actions have\nfirst been considered by Hermann [8]; they are called Hermann actions.\nIn [9], Hermann proved that the H\u2013orbit through g L \u2208 M , g \u2208 G is totally geodesic if and only if\nthe involutions ig \u03c3 i\u22121\ng and \u03c4 commute where we use the notation ig to denote the automorphism of\na Lie group G given by ig (x) = g x g \u22121 ; this means that the classification of commuting involutions\non G is equivalent to a classification of totally geodesic orbits of Hermann actions.\nConlon [3] determined all pairs of conjugacy classes of involutions \u03c3, \u03c4 for which there is a\ng \u2208 G such that ig \u03c3i\u22121\ng and \u03c4 commute. The proof relies on the unpublished notes [2]. (For inner\ninvolutions \u03c3 = ia , \u03c4 = ib there is obviously always such a g since there is a g \u2208 G such that g a g \u22121\nand b are contained in one and the same maximal torus of G.) Our classification however uses a\ndirect approach which does not rely on any of the previously mentioned results.\nTheorem 1.2. Let g be a compact exceptional Lie algebra of type e6 , e7 , e8 , f4 , or g2 . If \u03c3, \u03c4 \u2208\nAut(g) are two commuting involutions such that \u03c3 6= \u03c4 then the pair (g, g\u03c3 \u2229 g\u03c4 ) is one of the pairs\n(g, k) given by Table 1; the conjugacy classes of \u03c3, \u03c4 and \u03c3\u03c4 are given by the first row of Table 1.\nConversely, for any pair of Lie algebras (g, k) in Table 1 there exists a pair (\u03c3, \u03c4 ) of commuting\ninvolutions of g such that k \u223c\n= g\u03c3 \u2229 g\u03c4 .\n2\n\n\fThe data in Table 1 in all cases but one determines the conjugacy class of the subalgebra k \u2282 g,\nsee Remark 4.2. To prove Theorem 1.2, we first exhibit various standard examples for pairs of\ninvolutions on exceptional Lie algebras in Section 3. Then it is shown in Section 4 that these\nconstructions already exhaust all possibilities for Z2 \u00d7 Z2 \u2013symmetric spaces.\nTheorem 1.3. Let k \u2282 g = so(8) be a subalgebra such that there are two commuting involutions\n\u03c3 and \u03c4 , \u03c3 6= \u03c4 , of g with k = g\u03c3 \u2229 g\u03c4 . Then there is an automorphism \u03c6 of so(8) such that \u03c6(k)\nis one of the following subalgebras of so(8).\n(i) so(n1 ) + so(n2 ) + so(n3 ), n1 + n2 + n3 = 8, ni \u2265 1;\n(ii) so(n1 ) + so(n2 ) + so(n3 ) + so(n4 ), n1 + n2 + n3 + n4 = 8, ni \u2265 1;\n(iii) u(3) + u(1).\nNote that for the case of so(8) there are less cases than there are in the classification of Bahturin\nand Goze [1] for the Lie algebras so(n), n 6= 8, since some of the Z2 \u00d7 Z2 \u2013symmetric subalgebras for\ngeneral so(n) which appear as distinct cases in [1] are conjugate by some automorphism of so(8).\nTheorem 1.3 is proved in Section 5.\n2. Preliminaries\nDefinition 2.1. Let g be a Lie algebra. We say that k \u2282 g is a symmetric subalgebra of g if there\nis a nontrivial automorphism \u03c3 of g with \u03c3 2 = idg such that k = g\u03c3 := {X \u2208 g | \u03c3(X) = X}. If G\nis a Lie group, we say that a closed subgroup K \u2282 G is a symmetric subgroup if the Lie algebra\nof K is a symmetric subalgebra in the Lie algebra of G.\nProposition 2.2. Let g be a real Lie algebra. Let \u03c3, \u03c4 be automorphisms of g such that \u03c3 2 =\n\u03c4 2 = idg , \u03c3\u03c4 = \u03c4 \u03c3, \u03c3 6= \u03c4 . Then the Lie algebra g splits as a direct sum of vector spaces\n(2.1)\n\ng = g1 \u2295 g\u03c3 \u2295 g\u03c4 \u2295 g\u03c3\u03c4 ,\n\u03c3\n\n\u03c4\n\n\u03c3\n\nwhere g1 = g \u2229 g , g1 + g\u03c3 = g , g1 + g\u03c4 = g\u03c4 , g1 + g\u03c3\u03c4 = g\u03c3\u03c4 such that the following hold:\n(i) We have [g\u03c6 , g\u03c8 ] \u2286 g\u03c6\u03c8 for all \u03c6, \u03c8 \u2208 \u0393, i.e. the Lie algebra g is \u0393-graded, where \u0393 =\n{1, \u03c3, \u03c4, \u03c3\u03c4 } is the subgroup of Aut(g) generated by \u03c3 and \u03c4 .\n(ii) For all \u03c6 \u2208 \u0393 \\ {1} we have that g1 is a symmetric subalgebra of g1 + g\u03c6 .\n(iii) For all \u03c6 \u2208 \u0393 \\ {1} we have that g1 + g\u03c6 is a symmetric subalgebra of g.\nProof. Consider the Cartan decomposition g = g\u03c3 + p\u03c3 . Since \u03c4 commutes with \u03c3, it leaves this\ndecomposition invariant and hence we have further splittings g\u03c3 = (g\u03c3 \u2229 g\u03c4 ) + (g\u03c3 \u2229 p\u03c4 ) and\np\u03c3 = (p\u03c3 \u2229 g\u03c4 ) + (p\u03c3 \u2229 p\u03c4 ), where g = g\u03c4 + p\u03c4 is the Cartan decomposition with respect to \u03c4 . Define\ng\u03c3 = g\u03c3 \u2229 p\u03c4 , g\u03c4 = g\u03c4 \u2229 p\u03c3 and g\u03c3\u03c4 = p\u03c3 \u2229 p\u03c4 . Now the assertions of the proposition are easily\nchecked.\n\u0003\nConversely, given a Z2 \u00d7 Z2 \u2013grading on a Lie algebra g, one can define a pair of commuting\ninvolutions \u03c3, \u03c4 on g such that (2.1) agrees with the grading. Thus our results are equivalent to a\nclassification of Z2 \u00d7 Z2 -gradings on e6 , e7 , e8 , f4 , g2 and so(8).\nIn order to classify Z2 \u00d7 Z2 \u2013symmetric spaces, we want to find all possibilities for a pair of\ninvolutions (\u03c3, \u03c4 ) such that \u03c3 and \u03c4 commute. It follows from Proposition 2.2 that in this case we\nhave\n(2.2)\n\ndim g \u2212 dim g\u03c3 \u2212 dim g\u03c4 = dim g\u03c3\u03c4 \u2212 2 dim g\u03c3 \u2229 g\u03c4 .\n\nThis gives a necessary condition for the existence of Z2 \u00d7 Z2 \u2013symmetric spaces of certain types.\nNote that the left hand side in (2.2) depends only on the conjugacy classes of \u03c3 and \u03c4 ; we define\nd := d(\u03c3, \u03c4 ) := dim g\u2212dim g\u03c3 \u2212dim g\u03c4 . In order to find candidates for the pair (g\u03c3\u03c4 , g\u03c3 \u2229 g\u03c4 ), we list\nall symmetric subalgebras of symmetric subalgebras in exceptional compact Lie algebras in Table 4,\n3\n\n\fwhere for each pair (h, k) the number c(h, k) := dim h\u22122 dim k is given. By (2.2), the only candidates\nfor a pair (g\u03c3\u03c4 , g\u03c3 \u2229 g\u03c4 ) are those pairs (h, k), where the number c(h, k) equals d. Furthermore,\nwe may eliminate immediately all pairs (h, k) from the list of candidates which do not fulfil the\nnecessary condition that g\u03c3 and g\u03c4 both contain a symmetric subalgebra isomorphic to k. However,\nthese are only necessary conditions and we have to check in each case if a decomposition (2.1) with\ng\u03c3\u03c4 \u223c\n= k actually exists.\n= h, g\u03c3 \u2229 g\u03c4 \u223c\nFor the convenience of the reader we list the symmetric subalgebras k of simple compact exceptional Lie algebras g below in Table 2; in Tables 3 and 5 we list pairs of (conjugacy classes\nof) involutions on the exceptional Lie algebras and so(8), respectively, together with the numbers\nd = d(\u03c3, \u03c4 ).\n\nEI\nE II\nE III\nE IV\nEV\nE VI\n\ng\ne6\ne6\ne6\ne6\ne7\ne7\n\nk\nsp(4)\nsu(6) + sp(1)\nso(10) + R\nf4\nsu(8)\nso(12) + sp(1)\n\nE VII\nE VIII\nE IX\nFI\nF II\nG\n\ng\ne7\ne8\ne8\nf4\nf4\ng2\n\nk\ne6 + R\nso(16)\ne7 + sp(1)\nsp(3) + sp(1)\nso(9)\nsp(1) + sp(1)\n\nTable 2. Exceptional symmetric spaces of type I.\n\n3. Involutions of reductive Lie algebras and construction of examples\nWe will now discuss some constructions of Z2 \u00d7 Z2 \u2013symmetric spaces. We start with a list\nof several possibilities how one can define involutive automorphisms of a reductive complex Lie\nalgebra from a given root space decomposition. Let g be a reductive complex Lie algebra with\nCartan subalgebra g0 and let\nX\n(3.1)\ng = g0 +\ng\u03b1 ,\n\u03b1\u2208\u03a6\n\nbe the root space decomposition with respect to g0 . Also assume that we have chosen once and\nfor all a set {\u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1n } of simple roots.\nType 1. Let h \u2282 g be a symmetric subalgebra of maximal rank. P\nThen we may assume that h\ncontains g0 . Hence there is a subset S \u2282 \u03a6 such that h = g0 + \u03b1\u2208S g\u03b1 and we may define\nan involutive\nautomorphism \u03c3 of g by requiring that \u03c3(X) = X if X \u2208 h and \u03c3(X) = \u2212X if\nP\nX \u2208 \u03b1\u2208\u03a6\\S g\u03b1 . The corresponding symmetric spaces are exactly those where the involution is\nan inner automorphism.\nType 2. Outer involutions induced from automorphisms of the Dynkin diagram, see [7], Ch. X, \u00a7 5:\nThe corresponding simply connected irreducible symmetric spaces with simple compact isometry\ngroup are SU(2n + 1)/SO(2n + 1), SU(2n)/Sp(n), SO(2n + 2)/SO(2n + 1) and E6 /F4 .\nType 3. Let g be a reductive complex Lie algebra and let t \u2282 g be a Cartan subalgebra. Then\nthere is an automorphism \u03c3 of g which acts as minus identity on t and sends each root to its\nnegative. The symmetric spaces G/H given in this way are exactly those where rk G/H = rk G;\nthe Satake diagram of G/H is given by the Dynkin diagram of G with uniform multiplicity one. The\nautomorphisms obtained in this way may be inner or outer. The corresponding irreducible compact\nsymmetric space are: A I, SO(2n + 1)/SO(n + 1) \u00d7 SO(n), Sp(n)/U(n), SO(2n)/SO(n) \u00d7 SO(n),\nE I, E V, E VIII, F I, G.\n4\n\n\fNote that the distinction of the three types of involutions above pertains to the action of the\ninvolution with respect to one fixed Cartan subalgebra. While Type 1 involutions obviously are\nnever conjugate to involutions of type Type 2, a Type 3 involution may be conjugate to a Type 1\nor Type 2 involution.\nIn the examples below, we show how to construct various Z2 \u00d7 Z2 \u2013symmetric spaces mainly\nby combining two commuting involutions as defined above with respect to one fixed root space\ndecomposition (3.1). We start with the examples where both involutions are of Type 1.\nExample 3.1. Let G be a connected compact Lie group and let \u03c31 and \u03c32 be two involutions of G\ndefined by conjugation with the elements g1 and g2 , respectively, of G, such that the fixed point\nsets G\u03c31 and G\u03c32 are non-isomorphic. After conjugation, we may assume that g1 and g2 are both\ncontained in one and the same maximal Torus T of G; in particular, \u03c31 and \u03c32 commute. Consider\nthe root space decomposition (3.1) where g0 is the complexification of the Lie algebra of T . Then\nthe automorphisms of gC induced by \u03c3 P\nand \u03c4 are both of Type 1 and the complexification of the\nLie algebra of G\u03c3 \u2229 G\u03c4 is given by g0 + \u03b1\u2208S1 \u2229S2 g\u03b1 , where Si is the root system of G\u03c3i , i = 1, 2,\nw.r.t. g0 .\nThe maximal subgroups of maximal rank in a simple compact Lie group G can be conveniently\ndescribed by using extended Dynkin diagrams, cf. [14], 1.3.11. The nodes of the extended Dynkin\ndiagram correspond to roots \u03b10 , \u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1n , where \u03b11 , . . . , \u03b1n are the simple roots and \u03b10 = \u2212\u03b4\nwhere \u03b4 is highest root. The simple roots of a maximal subgroup of maximal rank are then given by\ncertain subsets of the set of nodes of the extended Dynkin diagram. For the groups E6 , E7 and E8\nthese subsets are given below by the black nodes r for the symmetric ones among the subgroups\nof maximal rank. The root systems Si of these subgroups are given as the union of all roots which\nare integral linear combinations of the simple roots corresponding to black nodes. Now we may\nconsider two diagrams depicting two symmetric subgroups G\u03c31 and G\u03c32 of maximal rank. Then\nthe root system of G\u03c31 \u2229 G\u03c32 with respect to g0 is given by S1 \u2229 S2 and it is a straightforward task\nto explicitly determine this set. However, to completely avoid these computations, we will use a\nsimplified approach. We know from [14], 1.3, Proposition 15, that both G\u03c31 and G\u03c32 contain a\nsubgroup whose simple roots with respect to g0 are those whose corresponding nodes are marked\nblack in both diagrams. Thus we obtain the set of simple roots of a regular subgroup of G contained\nin the intersection G\u03c3 \u2229 G\u03c4 . This information, together with a dimension count using Tables 3 and\n4, turns out to be sufficient in all cases given below to identify the connected component of the\nintersection G\u03c3 \u2229 G\u03c4 , which is a symmetric subgroup of both G\u03c3 and G\u03c4 .\nThe symmetric subgroups of maximal rank in E6 , namely SU(6) * Sp(1) and Spin(10) * U(1) are\ngiven by the following diagrams:\nr\nE II\n\nE II'\n\n\u275c\nr\n\nr\n\nr\n\n\u275c\n\nr\n\nr\n\nr\n\nE III\n\nr\n\u275cr\n\n\u275cr\n\n\u275cr\n\n\u275c\n\nr\u275c\n\nr\u275c\n\u275cr\n\n\u275cr\n\n\u275cr\n\n\u275cr\n\n\u275c\n\nComparing E-II and E-III, we see that there is a Z2 \u00d7Z2 \u2013symmetric space G/K such that k contains\na subalgebra isomorphic to su(5) + R + R. A simple dimension count, facilitated by Tables 3 and 4,\nshows that the corresponding Z2 \u00d7Z2 \u2013symmetric space is of type E II-III-III with k \u223c\n= su(5)+R+R.\nUsing an alternative embedding of SU(6) * Sp(1) into E6 , shown as E II', and combining it with\nE II, we obtain a Z2 \u00d7 Z2 \u2013symmetric space with k \u223c\n= su(4) + sp(1) + sp(1) + R \u223c\n= so(6) + so(4) + R\nof type E II-II-III. Combining E III and E III' (as given in Example 3.6 below) we construct a\nZ2 \u00d7 Z2 \u2013symmetric space of type E III-III-III with k = so(8) + R + R.\nThe connected symmetric subgroups of E7 , namely SU(8), Spin(12) * Sp(1) and E6 * U(1), are\ngiven by the following diagrams.\n5\n\n\fr\n\n\u275c\nEV r\n\nr\n\nr\n\nr\n\nr\n\nr\n\nr\n\nE VI \u275cr\n\nr\u275c\n\nE VII \u275c\n\n\u275cr\n\n\u275cr\n\n\u275cr\n\n\u275c\n\nr\u275c\n\nr\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\n\u275cr\n\nr\nE VI' r\u275c\n\n\u275cr\n\nr\u275c\n\nr\u275c\n\nr\u275c\n\nr\u275c\n\nr\u275c\n\nr\u275c\n\nr\u275c\n\nr\n\n\u275c\n\nCombining E V and E VI we obtain a Z2 \u00d7 Z2 \u2013symmetric space with k = su(6) + sp(1) + R of type\nE V-VI-VII. Combining E VI and E VII we obtain a Z2 \u00d7 Z2 \u2013symmetric space with k containing a\nsubalgebra isomorphic to so(10) + R + R; using Tables 3 and 4 it follows that the corresponding\nZ2 \u00d7 Z2 \u2013symmetric space is of type E VI-VII-VII with k \u223c\n= so(10) + R + R. Combining E VI\nwith E VI', we obtain a Z2 \u00d7 Z2 \u2013symmetric space such that k contains a subalgebra isomorphic to\nso(8) + sp(1) + sp(1). We see from Tables 3 and 4 that the corresponding Z2 \u00d7 Z2 \u2013symmetric space\nis of type E VI-VI-VI with k \u223c\n= so(8) + so(4) + sp(1).\nThe connected symmetric subgroups of E8 , namely SO\u2032 (16) and E7 * Sp(1) are given by the\nfollowing diagrams.\nr\nE VIII r\n\n\u275cr\n\n\u275cr\n\n\u275cr\n\n\u275cr\n\n\u275cr\n\nr\n\u275cr\n\n\u275c\n\nE IX \u275cr\n\n\u275c\n\n\u275cr\n\n\u275cr\n\n\u275cr\n\n\u275cr\n\n\u275cr\n\nr\n\nCombining the two diagrams and using Tables 3 and 4 proves the existence of a Z2 \u00d7 Z2 \u2013symmetric\nspace of type E VIII-IX-IX with k \u223c\n= so(12) + sp(1) + sp(1).\nExample 3.2. Let now G be simple and let g \u2208 G be an element with i2g = idG . Let T be a\nmaximal torus of G containing g. Let w = k ZG (T ), k \u2208 NG (T ), be an element of the Weyl group\nWG = NG (T )/ZG (T ) of G such that the action of w on T does not leave the root system of ZG ({g})\ninvariant. Define h = w . g = k g k \u22121 . Then ig and ih are two conjugate commuting involutions\nof G whose fixed point sets do not agree. Hence they define a Z2 \u00d7 Z2 \u2013symmetric space.\nWe will now use this construction to prove the existence of various Z2 \u00d7 Z2 \u2013symmetric spaces.\nFirst, let G = F4 and let ig be an inner involution of type F II, i.e. the connected component of the\nfixed point set of ig is isomorphic to Spin(9). Define another involution ih as above; it is also of\ntype F II, but the fixed point sets of ig and ih do not agree. From Table 3 we read off that we have\nd = \u221220 for a pair of involutions of Type F II-II. In Table 4 there are two entries with g = f4 and\nc(h, k) = \u221220, namely k = sp(3) + R and k = so(8). Since sp(3) is not subalgebra of so(9), it follows\nthat the Z2 \u00d7 Z2 \u2013symmetric space constructed in this way is of type F II-II-II. This argument also\nshows that there is no Z2 \u00d7 Z2 \u2013symmetric space of type F I-II-II.\nNow let G = E8 and let \u03c3 be an involution of type E IX as given in Example 3.1 and let g\u03c3\nbe the Lie algebra of the fixed point set of ig . Consider the subalgebra h \u2282 g = e8 isomorphic to\nsu(3) + e6 given by the diagram below.\nr\n\u275cr\n\n\u275cr\n\n\u275c\n\n\u275cr\n\n\u275cr\n\n\u275cr\n\n\u275cr\n\nr\n\nLet W be the Weyl group of e8 with respect to g0 = t. The Weyl groups of g\u03c3 and of h are subgroups\nof W in a natural way. Comparing the two diagrams corresponding to g\u03c3 and h, respectively, we\nsee that there is at least one root space of g which is contained in the su(3)-summand of h, but\nnot in g\u03c3 . Hence there is a Weyl group element w \u2208 W \u2282 Aut(g) whose action on g leaves the e6 summand of h fixed, but which does not leave g\u03c3 invariant. This implies that there is an involution\n6\n\n\f\u03c4 6= \u03c3 such that g\u03c3 \u2229 g\u03c4 contains a subalgebra isomorphic to e6 . By a dimension count, this shows\nthe existence of a Z2 \u00d7 Z2 \u2013symmetric space of type E IX-IX-IX with k \u223c\n= e6 + R + R.\nNow consider g = e7 and let \u03c3 be an involution as given by the diagram E VI in Example 3.1.\nConsider the subalgebra h \u2282 g isomorphic to su(6) + su(3) given by the following diagram.\nr\n\u275cr\n\n\u275cr\n\n\u275cr\n\n\u275cr\n\nr\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\nr\u275c\n\nWith an analogous argument as above we may construct a Z2 \u00d7 Z2 \u2013symmetric space such that k\ncontains a subalgebra isomorphic to su(6). Using Table 4 we see that the corresponding Z2 \u00d7 Z2 \u2013\nsymmetric space is of type E VI-VI-VI with k \u223c\n= u(6) + R.\nFor G = E6 , consider the subgroup locally isomorphic to SU(3) * SU(3) * SU(3) given by the\nfollowing diagram.\nr\nr\nr\u275c\n\nr\u275c\n\nr\u275c\n\n\u275c\n\nr\u275c\n\nLt ig be an inner involution corresponding to the diagram E II from Example 3.1. Then there\nis a Weyl group element w = k ZG (T ) such that the involution ih with h = k g k \u22121 is such that\nthe Lie algebra of the common fixed point set of ig and ih contains a subalgebra isomorphic to\nsu(3) + su(3) + R + R. It follows from Table 4 that we have constructed a Z2 \u00d7 Z2 \u2013symmetric space\nof type E II-II-II with k = su(3) + su(3) + R + R.\nExample 3.3. Here we combine two involutions of Type 3 and Type 1, respectively. Thus let g be\na complex semisimple Lie algebra and let g0 \u2282 g be a Cartan subalgebra. Let \u03c3 be an involution\nof Type 3 on g. Let \u03c4 be an inner involution given as conjugation by an element t = exp X,\nwhere X \u2208 g0 . Then the\nP connected component of ZG ({t}) is the connected Lie subgroup of G\ncorresponding to g0 + \u03b1\u2208S g\u03b1 , where S is a certain subset of the root system \u03a6 of g with the\nproperty that for each \u03b1 \u2208 S we have also \u2212\u03b1 \u2208 S. Obviously, the two involutions commute and\nthe involution induced by \u03c3 on the fixed point set g\u03c4 of \u03c4 is the automorphism which acts as minus\nidentity on g0 and sends each root \u03b1 \u2208 S of g\u03c4 to its negative. Moreover, the fixed point set of\n\u03c3\u03c4 will be isomorphic to the fixed point set of \u03c3, since the corresponding symmetric spaces will\nhave isomorphic Satake diagrams. Hence the data of the Z2 \u00d7 Z2 \u2013symmetric space obtained in\nthis way can be immediately deduced from the classification of ordinary symmetric spaces. This\nshows the existence of the exceptional Z2 \u00d7Z2 \u2013symmetric space of types E I-I-II, E I-I-III, E V-V-V,\nE V-V-VI, E V-V-VII, E VIII-VIII-VIII, E VIII-VIII-IX, F I-I-I, F I-I-II, G as given in Table 1.\nExample 3.4. Let now G = E6 and choose a Cartan subalgebra g0 \u2282 e6 . Let \u03c3 be an involution of\nType 2, i.e. E IV and let \u03c4 be an involution of Type 3, i.e. E I. Then the two involutions obviously\ncommute. A dimension count using Tables 3 and 4 shows that \u03c3\u03c4 is of type E II and hence the\ncorresponding Z2 \u00d7 Z2 \u2013symmetric space is of type E I-II-IV with k \u223c\n= sp(3) + sp(1).\nExample 3.5. Let G = E6 . Let \u03c3 be the involution of Type 2 given by the permutation of the\nsimple roots \u03b11 7\u2192 \u03b15 , \u03b12 7\u2192 \u03b14 , \u03b13 7\u2192 \u03b13 , \u03b14 7\u2192 \u03b12 , \u03b15 7\u2192 \u03b11 , \u03b16 7\u2192 \u03b16 and let \u03c4 be the involution\nof Type 1 given by the following diagram, where the numbering of the roots \u03b10 , . . . , \u03b16 is given.\nr0\nr6\n\nE III'\n\u275c\n1\n\nr\u275c\n2\n\nr\u275c\n3\n7\n\nr\u275c\n4\n\n\u275c\n5\n\n\fType\nE I-I\nE I-II\nE I-III\nE I-IV\nE II-II\nE II-III\nE II-IV\n\nd\n6\n4\n\u22124\n\u221210\n2\n\u22126\n\u221212\n\nE III-III\nE III-IV\nE IV-IV\nE V-V\nE V-VI\nE V-VII\nE VI-VI\nE VI-VII\n\n\u221214\n\u221220\n\u221226\n7\n1\n\u22129\n\u22125\n\u221215\n\nE VII-VII\nE VIII-VIII\nE VIII-IX\nE IX-IX\nF I-I\nF I-II\nF II-II\nG\n\n\u221225\n8\n\u22128\n\u221224\n4\n\u22128\n\u221220\n2\n\nTable 3. Pairs of involutions on exceptional groups.\n\nThen obviously \u03c3 and \u03c4 commute and since \u03c3\u03c4 is an outer automorphism of E6 , it follows from\nLemma 4.1 that we have constructed a Z2 \u00d7Z2 \u2013symmetric space of type E III-IV-IV with k \u223c\n= so(9).\nExample 3.6. Let G = E7 . By [15], Thm. 3.1, there is an isotropy irreducible homogeneous\nspace E7 /L, where L is locally isomorphic to Sp(1) * F4 such that the 78-dimensional isotropy\nrepresentation \u03c1 is equivalent to the tensor product of the adjoint representation of Sp(1) and\nthe 26-dimensional irreducible representation of F4 . In particular, we may view the isotropy\nrepresentation as a representation of SO(3) \u00d7 F4 and choose two elements g, h \u2208 L such that the\naction of \u03c1(g) and \u03c1(h) is given by diag(\u22121, \u22121, +1) \u2297 e and diag(1, \u22121, \u22121) \u2297 e, respectively,\nwhere e stands for the identity element of F4 . Then the involutions ig and ih generate a subgroup\n\u0393 \u2282 Aut(E7 ) isomorphic to Z2 \u00d7 Z2 whose fixed point set has Lie algebra k \u223c\n= f4 . Since the\nfixed point sets of ig , ih and igh are all 79-dimensional, it follows that we have constructed a\nZ2 \u00d7 Z2 \u2013symmetric space of type E VII-VII-VII.\n4. The classification in the exceptional case\nLemma 4.1. There are no Z2 \u00d7 Z2 \u2013symmetric spaces of type F I-II-II, E I-III-IV, E II-IV-IV,\nE V-VI-VI, E VI-VI-VII E V-VII-VII.\nProof. The non-existence of type F I-II-II was already shown in Example 3.2. The non-existence\nof type E I-III-IV or E II-IV-IV spaces follows immediately from Tables 3 and 4. For a pair of\ninvolutions of type E VI-VI on E7 we have d = \u22125, see Table 3. It follows from Table 4 that there\nis no symmetric subalgebra k of h = su(8) or h = e6 + R such that c(su(8), k) = \u22125; this shows\nthere are no Z2 \u00d7 Z2 \u2013symmetric spaces of type E V-VI-VI or E VI-VI-VII. Now consider a pair of\ninvolutions of type E VII-VII on E7 ; by Table 3 we have d = \u221225 and it follows from Table 4 that\nk\u223c\n= so(10) + R + R or k \u223c\n= f4 ; since neither occurs as a subalgebra of su(8), we have proved the\nnon-existence of a Z2 \u00d7 Z2 \u2013symmetric space of type E V-VII-VII.\n\u0003\nRemark 4.2. In each row of Table 1, only the isomorphism type of the subalgebra k \u2282 g and the\ntype of the Z2 \u00d7 Z2 \u2013symmetric space (i.e. the entry in the first column defines the isomorphism\ntype of the three symmetric subalgebras g\u03c3 , g\u03c4 , g\u03c3\u03c4 of g) is given. However, this information is\nsufficient to determine the conjugacy class of the subalgebra k \u2282 g in most cases, since k \u2282 h is\nalso symmetric subalgebra for h = g\u03c3 , g\u03c4 , g\u03c3\u03c4 : Assume that g is a compact Lie algebra and let\nk \u2282 h \u2282 g and k\u2032 \u2282 h\u2032 \u2282 g be such that all inclusions are of symmetric subalgebras and such that\nk\u223c\n= h\u2032 .

(cont.)\n\nProof of Theorem 1.2. For each entry in Table 1 we have given a construction in Section 3 thus\nshowing the existence of a corresponding Z2 \u00d7 Z2 \u2013symmetric space. Lemma 4.1 shows that the\ntypes of Z2 \u00d7 Z2 \u2013symmetric space not listed in Table 1 indeed do not exist. (Note that on E6 , the\ninvolutions of type E I and E IV are outer, while the involutions of type E II and E III are inner; in\nparticular, there cannot be Z2 \u00d7 Z2 \u2013symmetric spaces of type E I-I-I or of type E I-II-II etc.)\nHowever, it remains to be shown that the type of the Z2 \u00d7 Z2 \u2013symmetric space as given in\nTable 1 indeed determines the conjugacy class of the fixed point set k = g\u03c3 \u2229 g\u03c4 except for spaces of\ntype E VI-VI-VI. In most cases, it can be seen from Tables 3 and 4 that the conjugacy class of the\nsubalgebra k \u2282 g is uniquely determined by the type of the Z2 \u00d7 Z2 \u2013symmetric space, i.e. in most\ncases, the conjugacy class of the subalgebra k is uniquely determined by the triple (g, h, c(h, k))\nwhere c(h, k) = d. There are three exceptions to this general rule:\nFor g = e6 we have two entries in Table 4 with h = su(6) + sp(1) and c(h, k) = 2, namely\nk = su(3) + su(3) + R + R and k = so(6) + sp(1). For the first possibility we have already shown\nthe existence of a corresponding Z2 \u00d7 Z2 \u2013symmetric space of type E II-II-II. The second possibility\n10\n\n\fwould imply the existence of a Z2 \u00d7 Z2 \u2013symmetric space of type E II-II-II with k = so(6) + sp(1) \u2282\nsu(6) + sp(1) such that the isotropy representation of k on g/k restricted to so(6) consists of a sum\nof three isotypical summands; however this is not the case according to [5], Tables 25, 26, pp. 200,\n206.\nThere are also two entries in Table 4 with h = su(6) + sp(1) and c(h, k) = \u22126, namely k =\ns(u(4)+u(2)) + sp(1) and k = sp(3) + R. For the first we have already shown the existence of a\nZ2 \u00d7 Z2 \u2013symmetric space of type E II-II-III in Example 3.1; the second one can be ruled out since\nsp(3) + R is not a symmetric subalgebra of so(10) + R.\nFinally, for g = e7 there are two items in Table 4 with h = so(12)+sp(1) and c(h, k) = \u22125, namely\nk = so(8)+so(4)+sp(1) and k = u(6)+R. We have shown the existence of a corresponding Z2 \u00d7Z2 \u2013\nsymmetric space of type E VI-VI-VI for both cases in Examples 3.1 and 3.2, respectively.\n\u0003\n5. The classification in the Spin(8) case\nIn [1], the Z2 \u00d7 Z2 \u2013symmetric space of the classical groups have been determined except\nfor G \u223c\n= Spin(8). This case requires special attention since the group of outer automorphisms\nOut(Spin(8)) = Aut(Spin(8))/ Inn(Spin(8)) is isomorphic to the symmetric group on three letters,\nwhereas for all other simple compact Lie groups the group Out(G) is either trivial or isomorphic\nto Z2 . In this section, we will classify the Z2 \u00d7 Z2 \u2013symmetric spaces with G = Spin(8). It was\nremarked in [1] that the result can be obtained from [4]. We give an independent proof, using an\nanalogous method as in the exceptional case.\nWe recall [12] that all connected symmetric subgroups of Spin(8) are conjugate by some automorphism of Spin(8) to one of the groups\nSpin(8 \u2212 n) * Spin(n),\n\nn = 1, 2, 3, 4.\n\nHowever, if one considers conjugacy classes with respect to inner automorphisms, there are three\nconjugacy classes of symmetric subgroups locally isomorphic to one of Spin(7), Spin(6) * Spin(2),\nSpin(5) * Spin(3), respectively, and only one conjugacy class of subgroups locally isomorphic to\nSpin(4) * Spin(4), cf. [12], Proposition 3.3. Hence there are ten conjugacy classes (w.r.t. inner\nautomorphisms) of connected symmetric subgroups in Spin(8); under the covering map Spin(8) \u2192\nSO(8), they correspond to the conjugacy classes (w.r.t. inner automorphisms) of connected (locally)\nsymmetric subgroups in SO(8) given by SO(7), Spin(7)+ , Spin(7)\u2212 , SO(6) \u00d7 SO(2), U(4), \u03b1(U(4)),\nSO(5) \u00d7 SO(3), Sp(2) * Sp(1), \u03b1(Sp(2) * Sp(1)), SO(4) \u00d7 SO(4), where \u03b1 = idiag(\u22121,1,...,1) .\nG\u03c3\nSpin(7)\nSpin(7)\nSpin(7)\nSpin(7)\nSpin(6) * Spin(2)\nSpin(6) * Spin(2)\nSpin(6) * Spin(2)\nSpin(5) * Spin(3)\nSpin(5) * Spin(3)\nSpin(4) * Spin(4)\n\nG\u03c4\n\nd\n\nSpin(7)\n\u221214\nSpin(6) * Spin(2) \u22129\nSpin(5) * Spin(3) \u22126\nSpin(4) * Spin(4) \u22125\nSpin(6) * Spin(2) \u22124\nSpin(5) * Spin(3) \u22121\nSpin(4) * Spin(4)\n0\nSpin(5) * Spin(3)\n2\nSpin(4) * Spin(4)\n3\nSpin(4) * Spin(4)\n4\n\nTable 5. Pairs of involutions on Spin(8).\n\n11\n\n\fExample 5.1. We may construct standard examples of Z2 \u00d7 Z2 \u2013symmetric spaces for g = so(8)\nusing a pair of commuting involutions both given by conjugation with diagonal matrices of the form\ndiag (\u00b11, . . . , \u00b11). In this way obtain Z2 \u00d7 Z2 \u2013symmetric spaces with k = so(n1 ) + so(n2 ) + so(n3 ),\nn1 + n2 + n3 = 8, ni \u2265 1 or k = so(n1 ) + so(n2 ) + so(n3 ) + so(n4 ), n1 + n2 + n3 + n4 = 8, ni \u2265 1.\nExample 5.2. Now assume the subalgebra so(6) + so(2) \u223c\n= u(4) \u2282 so(8) is embedded as\n\u001a\u0012\n\u0013\n\u001b\nt\nA \u2212B\n| A + iB \u2208 u(4) .\nB\nA\nWe may define a pair of commuting involutions of so(8) using conjugation with the matrices\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u2212I\nD 0\nJ=\nand A =\n,\nI\n0 D\nrespectively, where I is the 4\u00d74-identity matrix and D is either diag(\u22121, 1, 1, 1) or diag(\u22121, \u22121, 1, 1).\nWe obtain Z2 \u00d7 Z2 \u2013symmetric spaces with k = u(1) + u(3) or k = u(2) + u(2). Note however that\nthe subalgebra u(2) + u(2) of so(8) is conjugate to so(4) + so(2) + so(2) via an outer automorphism.\nProof of Theorem 1.3. Assume \u03c3 and \u03c4 are two commuting involutions of Spin(8). Then the g\u03c3\u03c4\nis a symmetric subalgebra of g = so(8) by Proposition 2.2. Hence we may assume (by applying\nan automorphism of so(8)) that g\u03c3\u03c4 is one of the subalgebras h of so(8) as given Table 6. Since\ng\u03c3 \u2229 g\u03c4 \u2282 h is a symmetric subalgebra of h, it is conjugate (by some automorphism \u03b80 of h) to one\nof the subalgebras k as from Table 6 such that c(h, k) = d(\u03c3, \u03c4 ).\nNow we show that any automorphism \u03b80 of h can be extended to an automorphism \u03b8 of so(8)\nsuch that \u03b8(h) = h and \u03b8|h = \u03b80 : This is obvious for inner automorphisms of h and there is only\none case where h has outer automorphisms, namely h = so(4) + so(4) \u223c\n= 4 * a1 . After choosing a\nCartan subalgebra of g contained in h, and a set of simple roots \u03b11 , . . . , \u03b14 we can define diagram\nautomorphisms which act by permuting the simple roots \u03b11 , \u03b12 , \u03b13 and hence by permuting the\ncorresponding three of the four a1 -summands of h. In addition, consider the inner automorphism\nig with g = ( I I ), I = diag(1, 1, 1, 1). This acts on h = so(4) + so(4) by interchanging the two\nso(4)-summands. These automorphisms together with the inner automorphisms of h extended to\ng generate a subgroup of Aut(g) isomorphic to Aut(h).\nHence there is an automorphism \u03c6 of so(8) such that \u03c6(g\u03c3 \u2229 g\u03c4 ) is one the subalgebras k \u2282 so(8)\nas given in Table 6. Conversely, it is straightforward to see that for each candidate (h, k) one can\nconstruct a corresponding Z2 \u00d7 Z2 \u2013symmetric space using Examples 5.1 or 5.2.\n\u0003\nReferences\n1. Y.
