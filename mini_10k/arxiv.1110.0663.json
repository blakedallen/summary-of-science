We analyse the relation between new generations and neutrino masses, one of\nthe strongest evidence for physics beyond the SM, in view of the possibility that the former are\ndiscovered at the LHC.\nGlobal fits of models with additional generations to the electroweak data have been performed and they favour no more than five generations. It should be kept in mind that most of\nthe fits make some simplifying assumptions on the mass spectrum of the new generations and\ndo not consider Majorana neutrino masses for the new generations or the possibility of breaking\ndynamically the gauge symmetry via the condensation of the new generations' fermions; all\nthese would give additional contributions.\nLEP II limits on new generation leptons are: ml\u2032 > 100.8 GeV and m\u03bd \u2032 > 80.5 (90.3) GeV\nfor pure Majorana (Dirac) particles. When neutrinos have both Dirac and Majorana masses,\nthe bound on the lightest is 63 GeV. For stable neutrinos LEP I measurement of the invisible\nZ width, \u0393inv , implies m\u03bd \u2032 > 39.5 (45) GeV for pure Majorana (Dirac) particles. Recent LHC\nbounds on the quarks are mt\u2032 > 450 GeV, assuming t\u2032 \u2192 bW , which in principle is plausible\nas EW fits bound the splitting within the doublets to be |mt\u2032 \u2212 mb\u2032 | < 80 GeV, and mb\u2032 > 385\nGeV. For the leptons, the splitting can be larger, |ml\u2032 \u2212 m\u03bd \u2032 | < 140 GeV.\nThe most striking effect of new generations is the enhancement of the Higgs-gluon-gluon\nvertex which arises from a triangle diagram with all quarks running in the loop, by a factor\nof 9 (25) in the presence of a fourth (fifth) generation. Thanks to that, LHC has been able to\nexclude, at 95% C.L., a fourth-generation SM-like Higgs in the range 120 < mH < 600 GeV.\n\n\fW\n\ne\u03b2\n\n\u03bd4 , \u03bd 4\u0304\n\u03bdi\n\n\u03bdj\n\ne\u03b1\n\nW\n\nFigure 1: Two-loop diagram contributing to neutrino masses in the four-generation model.\n\nStability of the Higgs potential, and triviality, together with these severe bounds, imply that\nif new generations exist, they will presumably come together with a new non-standard scalar\nsector, for instance, a strongly coupled composite Higgs, an extended Higgs sector or a Higgs\nwith invisible decays, for example, to dark matter. Of course, if both a new family and the\nHiggs with a 3 generations' Standard Model cross section are detected, new physics would be\nneeded to reconcile these facts.\nIn this talk (see 2 for further details and a complete list of references) we focus on how\nneutrino masses can be naturally generated at two loops by adding extra families and singlets.\nRecall that right-handed neutrinos do not have gauge charges and are not needed to cancel\nanomalies, therefore their number is not linked to the number of generations.\n2\n\nFour generations\n\nWe extend the SM by adding a complete fourth generation, i.e., with one right-handed neutrino \u03bdR , with a Majorana mass term 3 . We denote the new charged lepton E and the new\nneutrino \u03bdE . yi with i = e, \u03bc, \u03c4, E are the Yukawas of the doublets with \u03bdR . After spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) the mass matrix for the neutral leptons at tree level is a 5 \u00d7 5\nMajorana symmetric matrix which has only one right-handed neutrino Majorana mass term.\nTherefore, it leads\nto three massless Weyl\nqPmassive Majorana \u03bd4 and \u03bd4\u0304 , of\n\u0010q\n\u0011 neutrinos and two\n(0)\n2\nmR 2 + 4m2D \u2213 mR , where mD /v =\nmasses m4,4\u0304 = 21\ni yi \u2248 yE , with v = h\u03c6 i, and\n\ntan2 \u03b8 = m4 /m4\u0304 . Phenomenologically mR < 20 TeV, so m4,4\u0304 > 63 GeV. If mR \u226a mD , we have\nm4 \u2248 m4\u0304 and tan \u03b8 \u2248 1 (pseudo-Dirac limit) while when mR \u226b mD , m4 \u2248 m2D /mR , m4\u0304 \u2248 mR\nand tan \u03b8 \u2248 mD /mR (see-saw limit).\nSince lepton number is broken by the \u03bdR Majorana mass, there is no symmetry which\nprevents the tree-level massless neutrinos from gaining Majorana masses; they are generated at\ntwo loops by the diagram of figure 1. The eigenvalues of the light neutrino mass matrix are\nproportional to m4\u03bc , m4\u03c4 , m4E which gives a huge hierarchy between neutrino masses:\n1\nm2\n\u2264 2\nm3\n4yE\n\n\u0012\n\nm\u03c4\nmE\n\n\u00132 \u0012\n\nm\u03c4\nm4\u0304\n\n\u00132\n\n\u2264\n\n10\u22127\n,\n2\nyE\n\n(1)\n\nwhere we have used that mE , m4\u0304 \u2265 100 GeV. To overcome this huge hierarchy very small values\nof yE are needed, which would imply that the heavy neutrinos are not mainly \u03bdE but some\ncombination of the three known ones \u03bde , \u03bd\u03bc , \u03bd\u03c4 ; however this is not possible since it would yield\nobservable effects in a variety of processes, like \u03c0 \u2192 \u03bc\u03bd, \u03c0 \u2192 e\u03bd, \u03c4 \u2192 e\u03bd\u03bd... These require\nthat ye,\u03bc,\u03c4 < 10\u22122 yE , so yE \u2248 1. Therefore, the simplest version of the model is unable to\naccommodate the observed spectrum of neutrino masses and mixings.\nHowever, notice that whenever a new generation and a right-handed neutrino with Majorana\nmass at (or below) the TeV scale are added to the SM, the two-loop contribution to neutrino\nmasses is always present and provides an important constraint for this kind of SM extensions.\nIn figure 2 it is shown the upper bound in the Yukawa (yi , with i = e, \u03bc, \u03c4 ) versus Majorana\n\n\fLFV + univ. upper bound on y\u03a4\n0.100\n\nLFV + univ. upper bound on ye\n\nYukawa yi\n\n0.050\n\nLFV + univ. upper bound on y \u039c\nCosmology upper bound\non yi so m\u039d < 0.3 eV\n\n0.010\n0.005\n\n0.001\n0.001\n\n0.1\n\n10\n\n1000\n\nMajorana mass mR HGeVL\n\nFigure 2: General constraint on light neutrino masses in four generations' models with heavy Majorana neutrinos.\nWe show the bounds that LFV and universality from pion and tau decays set on the Yukawas at 90% C.L.:\ny\u03c4 < 0.3, ye < 0.08 and y\u03bc < 0.033.\n\nmass plane, so m\u03bd < 0.3 eV, as implied by cosmology. It is clearly seen that, for most of the\nparameter space (mR > 0.01 GeV), it is more restrictive than universality or LFV constraints.\nIt could be argued that new generation neutrinos may be Dirac particles, and the bound\nwould not apply. However, if light neutrinos turn out to be Majorana, it is natural that the\nheavy ones are Majorana as well, since lepton number is not conserved anymore. For instance,\nin a four generations context with light neutrino masses obtained via the see-saw mechanism, as\nlong as it is not completely decoupled from the light neutrinos, the fourth right-handed neutrino\nwill always acquire a Majorana mass at the two-loop level, even if it is set to zero by hand at\nthe Lagrangian level (in particular at the TeV scale for typical GUT scale Majorana masses of\nthe first three right-handed neutrinos), so the previous constraint will in general apply to the\nlight neutrinos' Yukawas.\n3\n\nThe five-generation model\n\nWe add two families to the SM and two right-handed neutrinos, \u03bd4R and \u03bd5R . We denote\nthe two charged leptons by E and F . The model, contrary to the four-generation case, has\nadditional sources of CP violation in the leptonic sector, however,\nP for simplicity we take all\nneutrino Yukawas y\u03b1 and y\u03b1\u2032 real. For simplicity, we also choose \u03b1 y\u03b1 y\u03b1\u2032 = 0.\nThe tree-level spectrum contains three massless neutrinos and four heavy Majorana neutrinos. The model should be compatible with the observed universality of fermion couplings\nand have small rates of lepton flavour violation (LFV) in the charged sector, which requires\n\u2032 , y \u2032 . In addition, it should fit the observed pattern of masses\nye , y\u03bc , y\u03c4 , ye\u2032 , y\u03bc\u2032 , y\u03c4\u2032 \u226a yE , yF , yE\nF\nand mixings, for instance, reproducing the tribimaximal (TBM) mixing structure.

Also the Higgs could be detected in this way:\ngg \u2192 H \u2192 \u03bd4 \u03bd4 \u2192 E \u00b1 E \u00b1 W \u2213 W \u2213 , giving a rather unusual signal, with hardly any background.\nWith respect to neutrinoless double beta decay, there are contributions of the new heavy\nneutrinos, however, we obtain the same combination of parameters as in the light neutrino\nmasses expressions, m4R \u01eb2 , leading to unobservable effects in 0\u03bd\u03b2\u03b2 when the former are fitted\n(of course the light neutrino contribution could be observed in the future, if the IH spectrum is\nrealized).\nTo summarize the phenomenology of the model we present in figure 3 b) the allowed regions\nin the \u01eb \u2212 m4R plane which lead to m3 \u223c 0.05 eV varying the charged lepton masses mE (mF )\nand the Dirac neutrino masses m4D (m5D ) between 100 GeV\u20131 TeV, and imposing the bound\non the neutrino mass, m4 > 63 GeV. We also plot the present bounds on the mixings \u01eb (\u01eb\u2032 ) from\n\u03bc \u2192 e\u03b3 and future much stronger limits from \u03bc\u2013e conversion if expectations are attained. So\nwith five generations and two singlets all current data can be accomodated in the shaded region\nof the parameter space between the curves of figure 3 b), which will be probed in the near future.\nAcknowledgments\nThis work has been partially supported by the grants FPA-2007-60323, FPA-2008-03373, CSD200700060, CSD2007- 00042, PROMETEO/2009/116, PROMETEO/2009/128 and MRTN-CT-2006035482 (FLAVIAnet).
