This collaboration has reported measurements of the rotation of the\npolarization of photons passing through a vacuum cavity in an external magnetic field. As is well known, this effect\ncan be qualitatively understood by the existence of light pseudoscalars bosons \u03c6 (the \"axion\"), with a coupling to\ntwo photons. In particular, the Lagrangian density of the photon-pseudoscalar system is given by\n1\ng\n1\nm2\nL = \u2212 F\u03bc\u03bd F \u03bc\u03bd \u2212 \u03c6\u03b5\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 F\u03bc\u03bd F\u03c1\u03c3 + \u2202\u03bc \u03c6\u2202 \u03bc \u03c6 \u2212 A \u03c62 ,\n4\n8\n2\n2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere mA is the mass for the axion field \u03c6. It is worth recalling at this stage that this theory experiences mass\ngeneration when the gauge field F\u03bc\u03bd takes a magnetic type expectation value [6]. If F\u03bc\u03bd takes an electric type\nexpectation value, tachyonic mass generation takes place [6]. Moreover, this theory leads to confining potentials in\nthe presence of nontrivial constant expectation values for the gauge field strength F\u03bc\u03bd [7]. In particular, in the case\nof a constant electric field strength expectation value the static potential remains Coulombic, while in the case of a\nconstant magnetic field strength expectation value the potential energy is the sum of a Yukawa and a linear potential,\nleading to the confinement of static charges. Notice that the magnetic character of the field strength expectation\nvalue needed to obtain confinement is in agreement with the current chromo-magnetic picture of the QCD vacuum\n[8]. Another feature of this model is that it restores the rotational symmetry (in the potential), despite of the fact\nthat the external fields break this symmetry. More interestingly, similar results have been obtained in the context\nof the dual Ginzburg-Landau theory [9], as well as for a theory of antisymmetric tensor fields that results from the\ncondensation of topological defects as a consequence of the Julia-Toulouse mechanism [10]. Accordingly, the above\ninterrelations are interesting from the point of view of providing unifications among diverse models as well as exploiting\nthe equivalence in explicit calculations. We also point out that confinement as a consequence of the interaction between\na non-Abelian constant chromo-magnetic background and the axion field has been recently investigated in [11].\nOn the other hand, we further observe that recently a novel way to describe axions has been proposed [2]. The\nmotivation for this is mainly to reconcile the results of the PVLAS experiment with both astrophysical bounds and\nthe results of the CAST collaboration. The crucial ingredient of this development is the existence of a new light vector\nfield ( rather than an axion field), which interacts with the photon via Chern-Simons-like terms. In such a case the\nLagrangian density reads\nm2\u03b3 2 m2B 2 \u03ba \u03bc\u03bd\u03bb\u03c1\n1 2\n1 2\nL = \u2212 F\u03bc\u03bd\n(A) \u2212 F\u03bc\u03bd\n(B) +\nA +\nB \u2212 \u03b5\nA\u03bc B\u03bd F\u03bb\u03c1 (A),\n4\n4\n2 \u03bc\n2 \u03bc 4\n\n(2)\n\nwhere m\u03b3 is the mass of the photon, and mB represents the mass for the gauge boson B. In particular, this alternative\ntheory exhibits an effective mass for the component of the photon along the direction of the external magnetic field,\nexactly as it happens with the theory (1).\n\n\u2217 Electronic\n\u2020 Electronic\n\naddress: patricio.gaete@usm.cl\naddress: ivan.schmidt@usm.cl\n\n\f2\nGiven its possible relevance in order to explain the discrepancy coming from the CAST collaboration, in this work\nwe wish to further elaborate on the physical content of the model (2), in particular its long distance structure. To\nthis end we will study the confinement versus screening issue and show that this theory can be further mapped into\nthe massive Schwinger model [12, 13]. Our calculation is accomplished by making use of the gauge-invariant but\npath-dependent variables formalism along the lines of Ref. [7]. This approach provides a physically-based alternative\nto the usual Wilson loop approach, where the usual qualitative picture of confinement in terms of an electric flux tube\nlinking quarks emerges naturally. As we shall see, our analysis reveals that although both theories (1) and (2) lead to\nan effective mass for the photon, the physical content is quite different. In other words, the confining nature of the\npotential is lost. On the other hand, if the same calculation is performed in the presence of two compact spacelike\ndimensions, we again find a confining potential. In this way we establish a new and peculiar connection with the\nSchwinger model, in the hope that this will be helpful to understand better axion-like models.\nII.\n\nINTERACTION ENERGY\n\nWe now examine the interaction energy between static point-like sources for the model (2). This can be done by\ncomputing the expectation value of the energy operator H in the physical state |\u03a6i describing the sources, which we\nwill denote by hHi\u03a6 .\nBefore proceeding with the determination of the interaction energy, it is worthwhile noticing that the coupling for\nboth theories (1) and (2) is identical. In fact, as was first mentioned in Ref. [2], substituting B\u03bc by \u2202\u03bc \u03c6 in (2), the\ntheory under consideration assumes the form\nm2\u03b3\n1 2\n1\n\u03ba \u03bc\u03bd\u03bb\u03c1\nL = \u2212 F\u03bc\u03bd\n\u03b5\nF\u03bc\u03bd F\u03bb\u03c1 \u03c6.\n+\n+ \u2202\u03bc \u03c6\u2202 \u03bc \u03c6 \u2212\n4\n2\n2\n4mB\nThus we shall begin considering the following generating functional:\n\u001a Z\n\u001b\nZ\n4\nZ = D\u03c6DA exp i d xL ,\n\n(3)\n\n(4)\n\nwhere the Lagrangian density is given by (3). We restrict ourselves to static scalar fields, a consequence of this is\nthat \u25b3\u03c6 = \u2212\u22072 \u03c6, with \u25b3 \u2261 \u2202\u03bc \u2202 \u03bc . It also implies that, after performing the integration over \u03c6 in Z, the effective\nLagrangian density reads\nm2\u03b3 2\n1 2\n1\n\u03ba2 \u03bc\u03bd\u03bb\u03c1\nL = \u2212 F\u03bc\u03bd\n+\nA\u03bc \u2212\n\u03b5\nF\u03bc\u03bd F\u03bb\u03c1 2 \u03b5\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4 F\u03b1\u03b2 F\u03b3\u03b4 \u2212 A\u03bc J \u03bc ,\n4\n2\n32m2B\n\u2207\n\n(5)\n\nwhere J \u03bc is the external current of the test charges. Furthermore, as was explained in [7], this expression can be\nrewritten as\nm2\u03b3 2\n1 2\n1\n\u03ba2 \u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2\nL = \u2212 f\u03bc\u03bd\n+\nA\u03bc \u2212\n\u03b5\nhF\u03bc\u03bd i \u03b5\u03bb\u03c1\u03b3\u03b4 hF\u03bb\u03c1 i f\u03b1\u03b2 2 f\u03b3\u03b4 \u2212 A\u03bc J \u03bc ,\n2\n4\n2\n8mB\n\u2207\n\n(6)\n\nwhere hF\u03bc\u03bd i represents the constant classical background. Here f\u03bc\u03bd = \u2202\u03bc A\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bd A\u03bc describes fluctuations around the\nbackground. The above Lagrangian arose after using \u03b5\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 hF\u03bc\u03bd i hF\u03b1\u03b2 i = 0 (which holds for a pure electric or a pure\nmagnetic background). By introducing the notation \u03b5\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 hF\u03bc\u03bd i \u2261 v \u03b1\u03b2 and \u03b5\u03c1\u03c3\u03b3\u03b4 hF\u03c1\u03c3 i \u2261 v \u03b3\u03b4 , expression (6) then\nbecomes\nm2\u03b3 2\n1 2\n1\n\u03ba2 \u03b1\u03b2\nL = \u2212 f\u03bc\u03bd\n+\nA\u03bc \u2212\nv f\u03b1\u03b2 2 v \u03b3\u03b4 f\u03b3\u03b4 \u2212 A\u03bc J \u03bc ,\n4\n2\n8m2B\n\u2207\n\n(7)\n\nwhere the tensor v \u03b1\u03b2 is not arbitrary, but satisfies \u03b5\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 v\u03bc\u03bd v\u03b1\u03b2 = 0.\nA.\n\nMagnetic case\n\nWe now proceed to calculate the interaction energy in the v 0i 6= 0 and v ij = 0 case (referred to as the magnetic\none in what follows). Using this in (7) we then obtain\nm2\u03b3 2\n1\n\u03ba2 0i\n1\nA\u03bc \u2212\nv f0i 2 v 0k f0k \u2212 A0 J 0 ,\nL = \u2212 f\u03bc\u03bd f \u03bc\u03bd +\n4\n2\n8m2B\n\u2207\n\n(8)\n\n\f3\nwith (\u03bc, \u03bd = 0, 1, 2, 3) and (i, k = 1, 2, 3).\nNow, we move on to compute the canonical Hamiltonian. For this end we perform a Hamiltonian\nanalysis.\n\u0011\n\u0010 constraint\n1\n\u03ba2\nv\nThe canonically conjugate momenta are \u03a00 = 0 and \u03a0i = Dij Ej , where Ei \u2261 fi0 and Dij \u2261 \u03b4ij \u2212 4m\n2\ni0 \u22072 vj0 .\n\nSince D is a nonsingular matrix (det D = 1 \u2212\nfor Ei as a function of \u03a0i , we get\nEi =\n\n\u03ba2 v 2\n4m2B \u22072\n\n1\ndet D\n\nB\n\n6= 0) with v2 \u2261 v i0 v i0 , there exists the inverse of D.

It explicitly reflects the breaking\nof the gauge invariance of the theory under consideration. As a consequence, special care has to be exercised since\nit is the gauge invariance property that generally establishes unitarity and renormalizability in most quantum field\ntheoretical models. In order to convert the second class system into first class we will adopt the procedure described\nin Refs.[14, 15]. An important feature of this development is that the new system still has the basic features of the\noriginal one and has reestablished the gauge symmetry. As was explained in Refs.[14, 15], we enlarge the original\nphase space by introducing a canonical pair of fields \u03b8 and \u03a0\u03b8 . Accordingly, a new set of constraints can be defined\nin this extended space:\n\u039b1 \u2261 \u03a00 + m2\u03b3 \u03b8 = 0,\n\n(12)\n\n\u039b2 \u2261 \u0393 + \u03a0\u03b8 = 0.\n\n(13)\n\nand\n\nIt can be easily checked that the new constraints are first class and in this way restore the gauge symmetry of the\ntheory under consideration. It is worthwhile remarking at this point that the \u03b8 fields only enlarge the unphysical\nsector of the total Hilbert space, not affecting the structure of the physical subspace. Therefore the new effective\nLagrangian, after integrating out the \u03b8, fields reads\n!\nm2\u03b3\n1\n\u03ba2 0i\n1\nL = \u2212 f\u03bc\u03bd 1 +\nf \u03bc\u03bd \u2212\n(14)\nv f0i 2 v 0k f0k \u2212 A0 J 0 .\n4\n\u2206\n8m2B\n\u2207\n\u0011\n\u0010\nm2\n\u03ba2\n0\u03bc 1 0i\nWith this in hand, the canonical momenta are \u03a0\u03bc = \u2212 1 + \u2206\u03b3 f 0\u03bc \u2212 4m\n2 v\n\u22072 v f0i , and one immediately idenB\n\u0010\n2 \u0011\nm\n\u03ba2\n1\ntifies the usual primary constraint \u03a00 = 0, and \u03a0i = \u2212 1 + \u2206\u03b3 fi0 \u2212 4m\n2 vi0 \u22072 vj0 fj0 . The canonical Hamiltonian\nB\ncan be worked out as usual and is given by the expression\n\u001a\n\u0011\u22121\n\u0010\n\u0011 \u001b\n\u0001 1 i\u0010\nR 3\nm2\u03b3\nm2\u03b3\n1 i\ni\n0\ni\nHC = d x \u2212A0 \u2202i \u03a0 \u2212 J + 2 \u03a0 1 + \u2206\n\u03a0 + 2 B 1 + \u2206 Bi +\nR\n2\n(15)\n\u03ba2\ni (v * \u03a0) .\nh \u2206\n+ d3 x 8m\n2 (v * \u03a0)\n\u03ba2 v2 \u2206\nB\n2\n2\n2\n\u2207 (\u2206+m\u03b3 ) (\u2206+m\u03b3 )\u2212\n4m2 \u22072\nB\n\nTemporal conservation of the primary constraint \u03a00 leads to the secondary constraint \u03931 (x) \u2261 \u2202i \u03a0i \u2212 J 0 = 0. The\npreservation in time of \u03931 does not give Rrise to any further constraints. The extended Hamiltonian that generates\ntranslations in time then reads H = HC + d3 x (c0 (x) \u03a00 (x) + c1 (x) \u03931 (x)), where c0 (x) and c1 (x) are the Lagrange\nmultiplier fields. Moreover, it is straightforward to see that \u02260 (x) = [A0 (x) , H] = c0 (x), which is an arbitrary\n\n\f4\nfunction. Since \u03a00 = 0 always, neither A0 nor \u03a00 are of interest in describing the system and may be discarded from\nthe theory. Thus the Hamiltonian takes the form\n\u001a\n\u001b\n\u0010\n\u0011\u22121\n\u0010\n\u0011\nR 3\n\u0001\nm2\u03b3\nm2\u03b3\n1 i\n1 i\ni\ni\n0\ni\nHC = d x 2 \u03a0 1 + \u2206\n+\n\u03a0 + 2 B 1 + \u2206 B + c (x) \u2202i \u03a0 \u2212 J\nR 3 \u03ba2\n2\n(16)\ni (v * \u03a0) ,\nh \u2206\n+ d x 8m2 (v * \u03a0)\n\u03ba2 v2 \u2206\nB\n2\n2\n2\n\u2207 (\u2206+m\u03b3 ) (\u2206+m\u03b3 )\u2212\n4m2 \u22072\nB\n\nwhere c(x) = c1 (x) \u2212 A0 (x).\nAccording to the usual procedure we introduce a supplementary condition on the vector potential such that the full\nset of constraints becomes second class. A convenient choice is found to be [16]\n\u03932 (x) \u2261\n\nZ\n\n\u03bd\n\ndz A\u03bd (z) \u2261\n\nZ1\n\nd\u03bbxi Ai (\u03bbx) = 0,\n\n(17)\n\n0\n\nC\u03bex\n\ni\n\nwhere \u03bb (0 \u2264 \u03bb \u2264 1) is the parameter describing the spacelike straight path xi = \u03be i + \u03bb (x \u2212 \u03be) , and \u03be is a fixed point\n(reference point). There is no essential loss of generality if we restrict our considerations to \u03be i = 0. This allows us to\nwrite the only nonvanishing equal-time Dirac bracket\n\b\n\nj\n\nAi (x) , \u03a0 (y)\n\n\u2217\n\n=\n\n\u03b4 ji \u03b4 (3)\n\n(x \u2212 y) \u2212\n\n\u2202ix\n\nZ1\n\nd\u03bbxj \u03b4 (3) (\u03bbx \u2212 y) .\n\n(18)\n\n0\n\nFinally we are ready to tackle the question of the interaction energy between pointlike sources, where a fermion is\nlocalized at y\u2032 and an antifermion at y. Since the fermions are taken to be infinitely massive (static) we can substitute\n\u2206 by \u2212\u22072 in Eq. (16). In such a case we write hHi\u03a6 as\n(\n! )\nZ\nm2\u03b3\n1 i\n1 i\n\u22072\n3\ni\nhHi\u03a6 = h\u03a6| d x\n(19)\n\u03a0 + B 1 \u2212 2 B i |\u03a6i ,\n\u03a0\n2 \u22072 \u2212 M 2\n2\n\u2207\n2\n\n2\n\n\u03ba\nB\n2\n2\n2\n2\nB\nwith M 2 \u2261 m2\u03b3 + 4m\nand \u03ba = m\n2 v = m\u03b3 + v 2 , where we have employed v = 4B\nvB .\nB\nB\nNext, as was first established by Dirac [17], the physical state can be written as\n\uf8eb y\n\uf8f6\nZ\n|\u03a6i \u2261 \u03a8 (y) \u03a8 (y\u2032) = \u03c8 (y) exp \uf8edie dz i Ai (z)\uf8f8 \u03c8 (y\u2032) |0i ,\n\n(20)\n\ny\u2032\n\nwhere |0i is the physical vacuum state and the line integral appearing in the above expression is along a spacelike\npath starting at y\u2032 and ending at y, on a fixed time slice. It is worth noting here that the strings between fermions\nhave been introduced in order to have a gauge-invariant function |\u03a6i. In other terms, each of these states represents\na fermion-antifermion pair surrounded by a cloud of gauge fields sufficient to maintain gauge invariance.\nFrom the foregoing Hamiltonian discussion, we first observe that\nZ y\u2032\ndzi \u03b4 (3) (z \u2212 x) |\u03a6i .\n(21)\n\u03a0i (x) \u03a8 (y) \u03a8 (y\u2032 ) = \u03a8 (y) \u03a8 (y\u2032 ) \u03a0i (x) |0i + e\ny\n\nSubstituting this in (19), we get\nq 2 e\u2212ML\n,\n(22)\n4\u03c0 L\nwhere hHi0 = h0| H |0i and |y \u2212 y\u2032 | \u2261 L. Since the potential is given by the term of the energy which depends on the\nseparation of the two fermions, from the expression (22) we obtain\nhHi\u03a6 = hHi0 \u2212\n\nq 2 e\u2212ML\n.\n(23)\n4\u03c0 L\nAs already stated, M is the effective mass for the component of the photon along the direction of the external magnetic\nfield. Accordingly, the above analysis reveals that, although both theories (1) and (2) contain the same coupling, the\nphysical content is quite different. It is important to realize that expression (23) is spherically symmetric, although the\nexternal fields break the isotropy of the problem in a manifest way. Another example where the rotational symmetry\nis restored was studied in the case of non commutative QED [18].\nV =\u2212\n\n\f5\nB.\n\nElectric case\n\nWe shall now consider the case v 0i = 0 and v ij 6= 0 (referred to as the electric one in what follows). In such a case\nthe density Lagrangian becomes\nm2\u03b3 2\n1 2\n1\n\u03ba2 ij\nL = \u2212 f\u03bc\u03bd\n+\nA\u03bc \u2212\nv fij 2 v kl fkl ,\n4\n2\n8m2B\n\u2207\n\n(24)\n\n(\u03bc, \u03bd = 0, 1, 2, 3) and (i, j, k, l = 1, 2, 3).\nThe above Lagrangian will be the starting point of the Dirac constrained analysis. As before, the above Lagrangian\nleads to a second class constraint. In view of this situation and following our earlier procedure, the new effective\nLagrangian takes the form\n!\nm2\u03b3\n\u03ba2 ij\n1\n1\nf \u03bc\u03bd \u2212\n(25)\nL = \u2212 f\u03bc\u03bd 1 +\nv fij 2 v kl fkl ,\n4\n\u2206\n8m2B\n\u2207\n\u0011\n\u0010\nm2\nThe canonical momenta following from Eq.(25) are \u03a0\u03bc = \u2212 1 + \u2206\u03b3 f 0\u03bc , which results in the usual primary\n\u0010\n\u0011\nm2\nconstraint \u03a00 = 0 and \u03a0i = \u2212 1 + \u2206\u03b3 f 0i . Defining the electric and magnetic fields by E i = f i0 and B i = 21 \u03b5ijk fjk ,\nrespectively, the canonical Hamiltonian assumes the form\n\u0010\n\u0010\n\u0011\n\u0011\no\nn\nR\nm2\nm2\n\u03ba2\nij m 1 kl n\nB \u2212\nHC = d3 x 21 Ei 1 + \u2206\u03b3 E i + 21 Bi 1 + \u2206\u03b3 B i + 8m\n2 \u03b5ijm \u03b5k ln v B\n2v\n\u2207\n(26)\nB\n\b\nR\n\u2212 d3 xA0 \u2202i \u03a0i \u2212 J 0 .\n\nTime conservation of the primary constraint leads to the secondary constraint \u03931 (x) \u2261 \u2202i \u03a0i \u2212 J 0 = 0, and the time\nstability of the secondary constraint does not induce more constraints, which are first class. Following our earlier\nprocedure, we will compute the expectation value of the Hamiltonian in the physical state |\u03a6i, that is,\n(\n! )\nZ\nm2\u03b3\n1\n3\nhHi\u03a6 = h\u03a6| d x\n(27)\nEi 1 \u2212 2 E i |\u03a6i .\n2\n\u2207\nHence we see that the potential is given by\nV =\u2212\n\nq 2 e\u2212m\u03b3 L\n,\n4\u03c0 L\n\n(28)\n\nwhere L \u2261 |y \u2212 y\u2032 |. It must be observed that in this case M reduces to m\u03b3 , and in the limit m\u03b3 \u2192 0 the potential\n(28) reduces to the Coulomb one [7].\nIII.\n\nFINAL REMARKS\n\nOur discussion, so far, has concentrated on the confinement versus screening issue for the recently proposed axion\nmodel (2). As we have seen, the coupling for this theory is identical to the traditional axion model (1). We have also\nseen that this alternative theory exhibits an effective mass for the component of the photon along the direction of the\nexternal magnetic field, as it happens with the theory (1). From this point of view, it is meaningful to ask wether the\nconfining nature of the potential can be recovered in some approximations. We now address this question.\nTo that end, we will discuss the mapping of the theory (7) into the massive Schwinger model. As was explained in\n[19], we illustrate this by making a dimensional compactification (\u00e0 la Kaluza-Klein) on Eq.(7). Then we see that the\nnew theory takes the form:\n\u0013\nX\u0012\n1\n\u03b62\n(1+1)\nL\n= \u2212 f\u03bc\u03bd\n1+\nf \u03bc\u03bd \u2212 A\u03bc J \u03bc ,\n(29)\n2\n4\n\u2206\n+\na\n(1+1)\nn\n\u0002 \u03b1\u03bc \u03b2\u03bd\n\u0003\n2\u000e\n\u03ba2\ng g v\u03b1\u03b2 g\u03b3\u03bc g\u03b4\u03bd v \u03b3\u03b4 and a2 \u2261 n R2 . We immediately recognize the above to be the massive\nwhere \u03b6 2 = m2\u03b3 + 8m\n2\nB\n\nSchwinger model with mass m2 \u2261 a2 . Notwithstanding, in order to put our discussion into context it is useful to\n\n\f6\nsummarize the relevant aspects of the analysis described previously [19]. We shall begin by recalling the interaction\nenergy for the massive Schwinger model taking a contribution of a single mode in Eq.(29). We obtain [13]:\n\u0012\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u0013\n\u0001 q2\na2\n4\u03b6 2\nq2\n\u2212\u03bbL\n1+ 2\n1 \u2212 2 L,\n(30)\n+\n1\u2212e\nV =\n2\u03bb\n\u03bb\n2\n\u03bb\n\nwhere \u03bb2 \u2261 4\u03b6 2 + a2 and |y| \u2261 L. Effectively, therefore, our initial theory (7) is mapped into the massive Schwinger\nmodel, which displays both the screening and the confining part of this interaction. Of course, if we consider the zero\nmode case, i. e. a = 0, the static potential above shows that confinement disappears. As in [19], we will concentrate\non the second term of Eq. (30), which represents confinement. The expression for the coefficient of the linear potential\nbetween two static point sources is:\n\u0011\n\u0010 2\nn22\nn1\n2 X\n+\n2\n2\nq\nR1\nR2\nT =\n.\n(31)\n2 n ,n \u03b6 2 + n212 + n222\n1\n\nR1\n\n2\n\nR2\n\nFollowing our earlier procedure, in the limit R1 , R2 \u2192 \u221e we obtain\nT = \u03c0q 2 R1 R2\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n\u039b\n\nd\u03c1\n\n\u03c13\n,\n\u03b6 2 + \u03c12\n\n(32)\n\nthat is,\n\u0014\n\u0012 2\n\u0013\u0015\n\u03c0q 2\n\u03b6 + \u039b2\n2\n2\nT =\n,\nR1 R2 \u039b \u2212 \u03b6 ln\n2\n\u03b62\n\n(33)\n\n\u000e\nagain if R1 , R2 \u2192 \u221e, we obtain a transcendental equation for \u039b \u03b6 2 :\n\u0013\n\u0012\n\u039b2\n\u039b2\n(34)\n\u2212 ln 1 + 2 = 0.\n\u03b62\n\u03b6\nq\n2\n2\u03c0T\nFrom (32) here we can deduce that as \u039b\u03b6 2 \u223c\nq2 R1 R2 \u2192 0, which means that \u03b6 has to grow stronger than \u039b\nwhen \u039b \u2192 \u221e, in order to obtain a finite coefficient of the linear potential. It is clear from this discussion that our\nphenomenological result (30) agrees qualitatively with the magnetic case of the usual axion model [7], in the limit\nof large L. Thus, only after the compactification, both theories are equivalent in the low energy regime. In this\nway we establish an intriguing analogy with the massive Schwinger model, which simulates the features of the usual\n(3 + 1)-dimensional axion model.\nIV.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nP.
