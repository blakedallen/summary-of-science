When propagating through media containing many scatterers, waves will be repeatedly scattered by each scatterer, forming a multiple scattering\nprocess[7]. Multiple scattering is responsible for phenomena such as random laser [8, 9], electronic transport\nin impure solids [10], and photonic or acoustic bandgaps\n[11, 12, 13]. Under proper conditions, multiple scattering\nleads to the unusual phenomenon of wave localization, a\nconcept introduced by Anderson [10].\nSuch a localization phenomenon has been characterized by two levels. One is the weak localization associated\nwith the enhanced back scattering due to constructive\ninterference from the reversed propagating paths. The\nsecond is termed as the strong localization (for brevity\njust termed as localization hereafter), in which significant inhibition of transmission surfaces, indicating that\nthe energy mostly remains in a region of space in the\nneighborhood of the emission. The generally accepted\nwisdom on the connection between the weak localization\nand the strong localization is that enhanced backscattering of a diffusive wave packet leads to an effective reduction in the diffusion constant of the wave packet. When\nthe influence of the increased backscattering is so overwhelming that the diffusion constant vanishes, the strong\nlocalization sets in.\nIt is worthy to mention that tremendous efforts have\nbeen devoted to investigate the localization phenomenon\nfor classical waves in random media over the past several years [14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23]. However, observation of classical wave localization is a difficult task, partially because suitable systems are hard to\nfind and partially because observation is often complicated by such effects as absorption and attenuation.\nOne important quantity associated with the wave localization is the localization length which is defined as\nthe characteristic decay length of the transmitted intensity through the system from the source. Taking into\n\naccount of the enhanced backscattering, the corrected\n(renormalized) diffusion constant may be obtained which\nthen may be set to zero to obtain the localization length.\nThis theoretical version of the localization length may\nbe found in the literature for various dimensions for both\nthe electronic waves and classical waves (e. g.[14, 24], and\nsummarized in Ref. [25]).\nA question we raise in this paper is about the validity\nof the existing theoretical formula for localization length,\nand subsequently the appropriateness or accuracy of the\nprevious theory of wave localization. A main reason behind raising this question is that it would be helpful to\nexperimentalists in designing experiments, provided that\nthe theoretical formula for localization length is accurate\nenough in both qualitative and quantitative sense, and\notherwise, it may mislead the experimentalists if the theory is not accurate enough.\nThe main aim of this paper is to answer the questions\nraised above for classical waves. One possible way is to\nconcentrate on an exactly computable system and find\nthe exact characteristic decay length of the transmitted\nintensity with the sample size, and compare with the\ntheoretical value of this particular system obtained from\nthe existing theory. In this paper, we first outline the\nprevious theory and show a numerically exact procedure\nfor the calculation of the localization length for classical waves in two dimensional media. Then we compare\nthe two results, to gain information about the accuracy\nand appropriateness of the previous theory. In addition,\nwe will also investigate the localization behavior as the\nfrequency varies. These will be followed by a detailed\ndiscussion on the implications of the results.\n\nFORMALISM\nExisting theory\n\nHere we briefly review the existing theory for wave localization. As wave propagates in random media, it experiences multiple random scattering, and as a result, the\nwave loses its propagating phase, leading to the gradual\n\n\f2\ndecreases of the coherence of the wave in the absence of\nabsorption, i. e. elastic scattering. Meanwhile, diffusive\nwave is built up as more and more scattering takes place.\nThe traditional picture of localization is in fact a version\nof localization of diffusive waves. In other words, the conventional wisdom towards the localization mechanism is\nthe absence of diffusion. The procedure to obtained the\nlocalization state can be briefly summarized as follows.\nThe quantity, D(B) which is a measure of diffusion of\nclassical waves is called the classical Boltzman diffusion\nconstant and it may be derived under the coherent potential approximation [2], and is given as [25]\nD(B) \u223c\n\nvt l\nddim\n\n(2)\n\nwhere LM and lm are the two cut-off limits. It is then\ninterpreted in the previous theory that the cut-off limit\nlm is a measure of the minimum scaling for the waves\nand is thought to be related to (for example) the mean\nfree path, whereas LM is a measure of the effective size\nof the sample. It is rather important to note that the\ncorrection in Eq. (2) is not only negative but diverges\nas LM approach infinity. This is obviously unphysical,\nsince the conductance or the corrected diffusion constant\ncannot be negative. To avoid the problem, it was conjectured that LM is in fact related to the localization\nrange, or simply the localization length, in such way that\nwhen LM is equal to the localization length denoted by\n\u03be say (i. e. LM = \u03be), the corrected diffusion coefficient\nbecomes zero, i. e. the absence of diffusion:\nDR (\u03be) = D(B) + \u03b4D(\u03be) = 0.\n\n\u03c0\n\u03betheory = lexp( Re[keff ]l),\n2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere vt is the transport velocity, l is the mean free path\nand ddim is the dimensionality.\nAs waves scattered along any two reversed paths in\nthe backward direction interfere constructively, leading\nto the enhanced backscattering effect, which will then\nadd corrections to the diffusion coefficient. In the two\ndimension case, such an enhanced backscattering effect\nis represented by a set of maximally crossed ladder diagrams. An evaluation of these diagrams leads to an\nintegration for which two cut-off limits have to be introduced to avoid the divergence. In this way, the correction\nto the diffusion constant for two dimensional system may\nbe found to be [25]\n\u03b4D \u223c \u2212ln(LM /lm )\n\nAs will be shown later, there are significant discrepancies between the result from the absence-of-diffusion\nmechanism and the result from the exact numerical computation. These discrepancies would indicate either that\nthe theory based on the diffusion mechanism is not accurate enough or simply that the theory has not yet fully\ncaptured the essence of the localization. We will come\nback to this later. Since the existing theory heavily depends on the diffusion picture, we may call it the diffusion\nbased theory.\nEquation (3) leads to the following solution for the\nlocalization length in two dimensions\n(4)\n\nUnder the effective medium theory, the mean free path,\nl may be obtained from the characteristic decay length\nof the coherent intensity and may be expressed as l =\n1\n2Im[keff ] and the effective wave number, keff may be written as\nr\n2\u03c0\nkeff = k +\n\u03c1f (0)\n(5)\nik\nwhere k is the wave vector of the incident wave propagating through the random scattering media with the\nscatterer numerical density \u03c1; f (0) represents the scattering function of a single scatterer in the forward direction. The forward scattering function can be calculated\nby the standard series expansion method for a cylinder\nwith radius a when a wave with wave vector k is incident\nnormally on it. The forward scattering function is given\nas\nr\n\u221e\n2 X\nCn e\u2212i(n\u03c0/2+\u03c0/4)\n(6)\nf (0) =\n\u03c0k n=0\nwith\nCn =\n\n\u2212\u01ebn (Jn\u2032 (ka)Jn (k \u2032 a) \u2212\n(1) \u2032\nHn (ka)Jn (k \u2032 a)\n\n\u2212\n\n1\n\u2032\n\u2032\ngh Jn (ka)Jn (k a))\n\n(1)\n1\n\u2032\n\u2032\ngh Hn (ka)Jn (k a)\n\nwhere \u01eb0 = 1 and \u01ebn\u22651 = 2, g is the ratio of the density of the scatterer to that of the media, h is the ratio\nof the wave speed in the sactterer to that in the media,\n(1)\nJn represents the Bessel function of order n, Hn represents n-th order Hankel function of first kind and prime\nindicates the derivative.\n\n(3)\n\nThe localization length \u03be is solved from this equation.\nIt is obvious that this equation always renders a solution\nand thus a localization length can always be found in two\ndimensions. Such an absence-of-diffusion mechanism is\nthe core of the previous theory of localization in two dimensions, and supports the assertion from a scaling analysis that all waves are localized in two dimensions[26].\n\nExact numerical calculation\n\nThus, on one hand the localization length for classical wave in a system consisting of any kind of cylindrical\nscatterers placed randomly in any media may be evaluated by the use of equations from the previous theory. On\nthe other hand, the localization length for classical waves\n\n\f3\nin two dimensional random media may also be calculated\nexactly by the use of the multiple scattering technique.\nConsider N straight cylinders located at r~i with i =\n1, 2, ..., N to form a completely random array. An acoustic\nline source transmitting monochromatic waves is placed\nat ~rs . The scattered wave from each cylinder is a response to the total incident wave composed of the direct\nwave from the source and the multiply scattered waves\nfrom other cylinders. The final wave reaching a receiver\nlocated at ~rr is the sum of direct wave from the source\nand the scattered waves from all the cylinders. Such scattering problem can be solved exactly, following Twersky.\nWhile the details are in [27], the essential procedures\nare summarized below. The formulation presented below has been successfully applied to explain the recent\nexperimental observations of acoustic crystals[28, 29].\nThe scattered wave from the j-th cylinder can be written as\n\u221e\nX\n\nps (~r, r~j ) =\n\ni\u03c0Ajn Hn(1) (k|~r \u2212 r~j |)ein\u03c6~r\u2212r~j ,\n\n(7)\n\nn=\u2212\u221e\n(1)\n\nwhere k is the wavenumber in the medium, Hn is the\nn-th order Hankel function of first kind, and \u03c6~r\u2212r~j is the\nazimuthal angle of the vector ~r\u2212r~j relative to the positive\nx axis. The total incident wave around the i-th cylinder\n(i = 1, 2, ..., N ; i 6= j) is summation of the direct incident\nwave from the source and the scattered waves from all\nother scatterers, can be expressed as\npiin (~r) =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\nBni Jn (k|~r \u2212 r~i |)ein\u03c6~r\u2212r~i .\n\n(8)\n\nn=\u2212\u221e\n\nThe coefficients Ain and Bni can be solved by expressing\nthe scattered wave ps (~r, r~j ), for each j 6= i, in terms of the\nmodes with respect to the i-th scatterer by the addition\ntheorem for Bessel function [30]. Then the usual boundary conditions are matched at each individual scattering\ncylinder. This leads to\nBni = Sni +\n\nN\nX\n\nCnj,i ,\n\n(9)\n\nj=1,j6=i\n\nwith\n(1)\n\nSni = i\u03c0H\u2212n (k|~\nri |)e\u2212in\u03c6~ri ,\n\n(10)\n\nand\nCnj,i =\n\n\u221e\nX\n\n(1)\n\ni\u03c0Ajl Hl\u2212n (k|~\nri \u2212 r~j |)ei(l\u2212n)\u03c6r~i \u2212r~j ,\n\n(11)\n\nl=\u2212\u221e\n\nand\nBni = i\u03c0\u03c4ni Ain ,\n\n(12)\n\nwhere \u03c4ni are the transfer matrices relating the acoustic\nproperties of the scatterers and the surrounding medium,\nand have been given by Eq. (21) in Ref. [28].\nThe coefficients Ain and Bnj can then be inverted from\nEq. (9). Once the coefficients Ain are determined, the\ntransmitted wave at any special point is given by\np(~r) = p0 (~r) +\n\nN\n\u221e\nX\nX\n\ni\u03c0Ain Hn(1) (k|~r \u2212 r~i |)ein\u03c6~r\u2212r~i ,\n\ni=1 n=\u2212\u221e\n\n(13)\nwhere p0 is the field when no scatterers are present.\nThe normalized transmission is defined as T = p/p0 and\ntherefore, the acoustic intensity is represented as |T |2 .\nThe averaged localization length is subsequently determined by[31]\n\u03beexact = \u2212\n\nL\n,\n< ln |T (L)|2 >\n\n(14)\n\nwhere L is the sample size, and < * > denotes the ensemble average over the random distribution of the scatterers. Thus obtained localization length can be compared\nto that in Eq. (4) obtained analytically from the previous\ntheory.\n\nRESULTS COMPARISON AND DISCUSSION\nResults comparison\n\nThe system we consider here consists of N identical air\ncylinders placed randomly in water medium. The reason\nbehind considering the system as the air cylinders in water is that due to the large contrast of densities for air\nand water, and also a large contrast of sound speeds in\nair and water, the air cylinders act as strong scatters to\nthe waves propagating in water media. The radius of\neach air cylinder is a. The fraction of area occupied by\nthe cylinders per area is \u03b2. the average distance between\nnearest neighbors is therefore d = ( \u03c0\u03b2 )1/2 a, which is also\nthe lattice constant for the corresponding regular lattice\narray. All the cylinders are placed completely randomly\nwithin a circle of radius L. A transmitting line source is\nlocated at the center and the receiver is located outside\nthe scattering cloud. In the computation, the acoustic intensity is normalized in such a way that its value equals\nunity when there are no scatterers present. Thus the uninteresting geometrical spreading effect is naturally eliminated. All the lengths are scaled by the parameter d,\nand the frequency is presented in terms of ka to make\nthe computation non-dimensional.\nFig. (1) shows the variation of < ln |T |2 > as a function of the system size, L for three different values of\nfrequency (ka = 0.01, 0.013 and 0.016) with the filling\nfraction, \u03b2 = 0.001. The < * > implies the configuration\naverage of the total transmitted intensity. Number of\n\n\f4\nconfigurations considered here is 200. It is apparent from\nthe Fig. (1) that the averaged total transmitted intensity\ndecays exponentially with the dimensionless system size,\nL for all the ka values shown in the figure which in turn\nindicates the localization of wave at those frequencies.\nThe localization length is nothing but the characteristic\ndecay length and thus it may be obtained from the inverse of the slope of the straight lines (in Fig. (1)) for\nthose frequencies. Similarly one may obtain the localization length of classical waves at other frequencies from\nthe exact numerical computation.\nFig. (2) presents the dimensionless localization length\n(\u03be) as a function of frequencies (ka) for \u03b2 = 0.001. The\ndashed curve with circles represent the localization length\nobtained from the exact numerical computation using the\nmultiple scattering technique while the solid curve represents the localization length calculated from the theoretical formula as prescribed earlier in Eq. (4). From\nthe dashed curve we observe that the localization length\nincreases very rapidly as the frequency of the wave is\ndecreased at the low frequency regime, the localization\nlength also increases rapidly with the increase of frequency at the high frequency regime and there is a minimum of localization length at an intermediate frequency.\nFor lower values of frequencies the waves propagating\nthrough the random media feel the media as homogeneous over a large distance depending on the wavelength,\nfor higher values of frequencies the waves are like very\nlocalized objects that can easily propagate between the\nscatterers and at an optimal frequency, the waves feel\nthe strongest scattering in the random media. Thus, the\nlarger values of localization lengths at lower and higher\nfrequencies and the minimum value of localization length\nat an intermediate frequency are understood physically.\nHowever, we observe that critical change in the localization length takes place at lower and higher frequencies.\nOn the other hand, the solid curve also shows similar behavior. But, one important difference is that the minimum of the dashed curve occurs at a higher frequency\nwhen compared with that of the solid curve. In other\nwards, the strongest localization predicted from the previous theoretical formula occurs at a frequency which\nis lower than that obtained from the exact numerical\ncomputation. And as a result, we observe that the two\ncurves cross each other at some frequency, say (ka)cr . For\nka < (ka)cr the localization length obtained from exact\nnumerical calculation is larger than that obtained from\nthe existing theoretical formula while for ka > (ka)cr ,\nthe theoretical value dominates over the exact value of\nlocalization length. [Note that both the results are theoretical though, the results (values) obtained from the\nprevious theoretical formula are termed as theoretical results (values) and those obtained from exact numerical\ncalculations are termed as exact results (values) and we\nmay use this convention for our convenience.] In the low\nand high frequency regimes, the discrepancies between\n\nthe theoretical and the exact values are significant.\nWe have also done similar calculations for \u03b2 = 0.01\nand compared the localization length obtained from the\ntheoretical formula with that obtained from the exact\nnumerical computation and is shown in Fig. (3). While\nthe theoretical formula seems to capture the shape of the\nexact results (Fig. (2) and Fig. (3)), but there are significant discrepancies with regard to whether the waves\nare most localized, and where localization length starts\nto increase rapidly.\nShown in Fig. (4) is the variation of localization length\n(\u03be) as a function of the filling factor \u03b2 for ka = 0.009\nwhich is less than (ka)cr in Fig. (2). The dashed curve\nwith circle represents the exact localization length obtained from numerical calculation, and the solid curve is\nobtained from theoretical formula. The solid curve shows\nthe monotonous decrease of the localization length as the\nfiling factor increases but the exact result (dashed curve\nwith circle) shows completely different behavior: the localization length initially decreases and then increases\nmonotonically, leaving a minimum at some value of \u03b2.\nThus, the wave with frequency ka = 0.009 becomes localized most strongly only for a specific value of the average\ndensity of scatterers. However, for ka = 0.009, the exact\nlocalization length is larger than the theoretical values\nfor all filling factors. Thus here we observe that at the\nfrequency, ka = 0.009 the theoretical results do not even\ncapture the trend of the exact results. Similar behavior\ncan be observed for a small range of frequencies around\nka = 0.009.\nThe variation of localization length (\u03be) as a function\nof the filling factor \u03b2 for a moderate frequency ka=0.015\nwhich is greater than (ka)cr in Fig. (2) is shown in\nFig. (5). The dashed curve with circle represents the\nexact result and the solid curve represents the theoretical result for localization length. The localization length\ndecreases with filling factor for both the curves. However,\nthere is a cross over between two curves at some value\nof \u03b2, say \u03b2cr below which the theoretical value is higher\nthan the exact value and above \u03b2cr the exact values are\nlarger than the theoretical values for localization length.\nThus at ka = 0.015, the exact and theoretical curves are\nsimilar in shape, the exact and theoretical values for localization length matches at \u03b2 = \u03b2cr , otherwise there are\nsignificant quantitative discrepancies. All the observed\ndiscrepancies between the theoretical and exact results\nare probably due to the approximations involved in the\nprevious theory.\nIn order to study the fluctuation behavior of localization, we define an exponent, by analogy with onedimensional cases[32],\n\u03b3\u2261\u2212\n\n1\nln(|T |2 ),\nL\n\n(15)\n\nwhich is reciprocal to the localization length. Fig. 6(a)\nshows the variance of \u03b3, i. e. var(\u03b3) =< \u03b3 2 > \u2212 < \u03b3 >2 ,\n\n\f5\nas a function of ka for \u03b2 = 0.001.\nWe interestingly observe that for a range of frequencies,\nthe fluctuation is rather small indicating that the wave\nis strongly localized in this range of frequencies. However, at low and high frequencies (below and above the\nrange of frequencies where the fluctuation is very small)\nthe fluctuation is high. This is an indication of some\ncritical change in the localization behavior and it tends\nto suggest that waves become very rapidly and critically\nless localized at low and high frequencies. It may also\nbe an implication of the localization-delocalization transition, as discussed in[33, 34]. These cannot be explained\nin the context of the current diffusion based theory. We\nalso plot the variance of the exponent \u03b3 versus the mean\n< \u03b3 > in Fig. 6(b). Here we do not observe the linear dependence between the mean localization length and the\nvariance, similar to 1D cases[32, 35]\nDiscussion\n\nAll the deviations from the predictions from the existing theory should possibly have a couple of important\nimplications. The first is merely that the theory is not\naccurate enough, since it is necessarily based upon a perturbation scheme given the complications involved in the\nproblem. If this scenario is valid, we could believe that\nthough inaccurate, the present theory still captures the\nfundamental nature of the localization phenomenon. It\nwould then be expectable that the discrepancies will be\nreduced when more and more relevant multiple scattering processes are included in the theoretical derivation.\nA next task would thus be to look for these scattering\nprocesses.\nThe second implication would be simply that the existing theory, which is based upon the absence-of-diffusion\nmechanism, has not yet fully encapsulated the essence\nof the phenomenon of wave localization. Beside the results shown above, there are other evidences indicating\nthat this line of reasoning should not be discarded too\nlightly. For example, it has been shown that in the localized state, a genuine phase-coherence behavior prevails\nas a unique feature of localized waves[33]. This coherent\nbehavior can be understood as follows. For quantum mechanic or acoustic waves, the current can be written as\nJ~ \u223c Re[\u03c8(\u2212i)\u2207\u03c8], where \u03c8 stands for the wave function\nfor quantum mechanical systems and for the pressure in\nacoustic systems. Writing the field as \u03c8 = |\u03c8|ei\u03b8 , the\ncurrent becomes J~ \u223c |\u03c8|2 \u2207\u03b8. It is clear that when \u03b8\nis constant at least by domains while |\u03c8| 6= 0, the flow\nstops, i. e. J~ = 0, and the wave or the energy is localized\nin space, i. e. |\u03c8|2 6= 0. Obviously the constant phase \u03b8\nindicates the appearance of a long range ordering in the\nsystem. All these have been demonstrated successfully\nnot only for two dimensional media[33, 34], but for one\nand three dimensions as well[21, 35, 36]. It can be easily\n\nshown that the same consideration also holds for electromagnetic waves[37]. In the current diffusion based theory, the phase information is not attained. Therefore, at\nleast the theory cannot account for the phase-coherence\nrelated localization phenomenon. Additionally, the theory could also be expected to fail when waves come to a\ncomplete stop before the diffusion becomes dominant.\nWe would like to make a further note on the existing\ntheory of wave localization. It has been widely believed\nin the literature that the theory has been tested experimentally to be very successful. Upon a close scrutiny,\nwe find that the success is mainly based upon two types\nof experiments. One is the measurement of the enhanced backscattering (e. g. Ref. [18]). In a rigorous numerical simulation, it has been shown that the\nenhanced backscattering is not directly related to the\nlocalization[20]. Waves are not necessarily localized when\na strong enhanced backscattering exits, and sometimes\nwaves can be localized even when the enhanced backscattering is weak. Asides from few exceptions[19, 23], the\nother type of experiments is based on observations of the\nexponential decay of waves as they propagate through\ndisordered media, as summarized in [22]; this setup scenario is in fact also the base for the previous scaling\nanalysis[26]. The recent research[38], however, has indicated that while this type of experiments can indeed help\nobtain information about whether a disordered medium\nwill or not prevent waves from propagation through the\nmedium, but this type of experiments is not sufficient\nto discern whether the medium really only has localized\nstates; this discovery is consistent with the prediction of\na recent scaling analysis[39]. Unwanted effects of nonlocalization origin can also contribute to the wanted exponential decay, likely making data interpretation ambiguous. In other words, there is a crucial need to differentiate the situation that waves are blocked from transmission from the situation that waves can be actually\nlocalized in the medium. This is also essential to a scaling analysis[39]. It is worth noting that there was report\nof the observation of microwave localization in two dimensions when a transmitting source is inside disordered\nmedia[19]. However, the diffusion based theory has not\nbeen verified against this experimental result. Instead,\nan exact numerical simulation based on the phase coherence picture is shown to agree well with the experimental\nobservation[37].\n\nSUMMARY\n\nThe localization length for classical waves in two dimensional random media is obtained from exact numerical computation as well as from the previous theoretical\nformula and then the results are compared. Significant\ndiscrepancies between the two results is observed. Furthermore, results indicate some critical change in the lo-\n\n\f6\ncalization behavior at low and high frequencies, and it\nseems to suggest that waves become very rapidly and\ncritically less localized at these frequencies. These features are not readily seen in the previous theoretical picture of wave localization. Therefore it is suggested that\ncaution should be taken when applying the previous analytic theory to infer the localization length of classical\nwaves. Possible implications of the present research are\ndiscussed.\nAcknowledgment\n\nThis work received support from National Science\nCouncil of Republic of China (Grant No: NSC 90-2811M008-004).\n\n[1] L.
