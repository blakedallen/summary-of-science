Important technological advances have\nbeen achieved in the purification of biomolecules and\nin cell separation techniques. Surface-modified\nnanoparticles are also developed for in vivo\napplications through highly specific Magnetic\nResonance Imaging (MRI) and drug delivery systems.\nDuring the last years, the functionalization of\nnanoparticles has become a key issue to permit a\ncontrolled assembly of nanostructures with a defined\nmolecular architecture and specific physicochemical\nproperties. The work described in this extended\nabstract aims to develop and characterize selfassembled functional magnetic nanocolloids with\ncontrolled hierarchical morphologies.\nA broad range of techniques in chemistry and physical\nchemistry are now being developed for the coating of\ninorganic nanoparticles [1]. The techniques of interest\nare the adsorption of charged ligands or stabilizers on\ntheir surfaces [2-4], the layer-by-layer deposition of\npolyelectrolyte chains [5] and the surface-initiated\npolymerization resulting in high-density polymer\nbrushes [6]. Other approaches have focused on the\nencapsulation of the particles in amphiphilic block\ncopolymer micelles [7,8].\nIn the present communication, we are following a\nstrategy based on the principle of electrostatic\ncomplexation. The nanoparticles were complexed\nusing asymmetric block copolymers, where one block\n\nis of opposite charge to that of the particles and the\nsecond block is neutral. Recently, it has been shown\nthat polyelectrolyte-neutral copolymers can associate\nin aqueous solutions with oppositely charged\nsurfactants [9-13], macromolecules [14-17] and\nproteins [18,19] and are capable of building stable\n\"supermicellar\" aggregates with core-shell structures.\nThe core of radius ~ 20 nm can be described as a\ndense coacervate microphase comprising the\noppositely charged species. The corona of thickness\n~ 20 \u2013 50 nm is made by the neutral chains and\nensures the colloidal stability of the whole.\nIn this paper, we have shown that it was possible to\nuse electrostatic self-assembly in order to stabilize\nand associate \u03b3-Fe2O3 superparamagnetic nanometer\nsize particles in a controlled manner. As anticipated,\nwe demonstrated that the core of the mixed\naggregates is made of densely packed nanoparticles.\nFor the first time, the aggregation numbers (i.e. the\nnumber of particles per magnetic core) could be\nestimated directly from the cryo-TEM pictures.\nMagnetic resonance spin-echo measurements\nindicated a significant increase of the ratio between\nthe transverse and longitudinal relaxivities, which\nusually tests the efficiency of contrast agents in MRI.\nThis result suggested that the polymer-nanoparticle\nhybrids designed by this technique could be used as\nT2-contrast agents for biomedical applications.\n\nExperimental\nThe cationic-neutral diblocks were synthesized by\n\n\fcontrolled radical polymerization according to MADIX\ntechnology [20]. The polyelectrolyte portion is a\npositively charged poly(trimethylammonium ethylacry\nlate) block, whereas the neutral portion is poly\n(acrylamide) [11,12]. Three molecular weights were\n-1\nput under scrutiny, corresponding to 7 (2 000 g*mol ),\n-1\n-1\n19 (5 000 g*mol ) and 41 (11 000 g*mol ) monomers\n-1\nin the charged blocks and 420 or 840 (30 000 g*mol\n-1\nor 60 000 g*mol ) for the neutral chain. In the\nfollowing, the copolymers are abbreviated as PTEA2Kb-PAM60K, PTEA5K-b-PAM30K and PTEA11K-b-PAM30K.\nThe role of the neutral chains was to prevent the\ncoacervate microphase to reach micron sizes at the\nmixing that would finally settle down over time. The\nsuperparamagnetic nanoparticles of maghemite (\u03b3Fe2O3) were made available to us by the Laboratoire\ndes Liquides Ioniques et Interfaces Charg\u00e9es,\nUniversit\u00e9 Pierre et Marie Curie (Paris, France). The\nparticles\nwere\ncharacterized\nusing\ndifferent\ntechniques, such as vibrating sample magnetometry,\nscattering and cryogenic electron microscopy\nexperiments. This size distribution of the particles was\nfound to be well-accounted for by a log-normal\nfunction, with a most probable diameter 6.3 nm and\npolydispersity 0.23. At the pH values at which the\ncomplexation occurred (pH 7 \u2013 8), the particles were\nstabilized by electrostatic interactions mediated by\ncharged ligands. The ligands adsorbed on the surface\nof the particles were citric acid in its sodium salted\nform\n(sodium\ncitrate).\nPolymer-nanoparticle\ncomplexes were obtained by simple mixing of stock\nsolutions prepared at the same weight concentration\nand pH. The relative amount of each component is\nmonitored by the mixing ratio X, which is defined as\nthe ratios of the volumes of nanoparticle solution\nadded relative to the polymer solution. Protocols for\nmixing oppositely charged species in solutions have\nbeen described previously [21].\n\nLight Scattering and Cryogenic Electron\nMicroscopy\nDynamic light scattering performed on \u03b3-Fe2O3\uf8e6\nPTEA5K-b-PAM30K solutions at c = 0.2 wt. % reveals\nthe presence of purely diffusive relaxation modes for\nall values of X. Fig. 1 displays the evolution of the\naverage hydrodynamic diameter DH derived from the\ntime dependence of the autocorrelation functions and\nfrom the Stokes-Einstein relationship. For X > 0.01,\nDH ranges between 60 nm and 80 nm. At large X (X >\n5), a second mode associated to the single\nnanoparticle became apparent. In this range, the\nautocorrelation is fitted by a double exponential decay.\nDH-values as large as 60 \u2013 80 nm are well above\nthose of the individual components of the system. The !\npolydispersity index resulting from the cumulant\nanalysis is found within a range of 0.10 to 0.25. In the\ninset of Fig. 1, cryo-TEM images illustrate the coreshell microstructure of the mixed aggregates. The\nphotographs\ncover\nspatial\nfields\nthat\nare\n2\napproximately 0.2\u00d70.3 \u03bcm and display clusters of\nnanoparticles. For contrast reasons, only the\n\ninorganic cores are visible with this technique. The\nextension of the polymer corona is shown by a circle\nof diameter DH.\n\nFigure 1 : Hydrodynamic diameter DH as a function of\nthe mixing ratio X for \u03b3-Fe2O3\uf8e6PTEA5K-b-PAM30K\nsolutions. Inset : cryo-TEM image of the nanoparticle\nclusters.\n\nRelaxometry\nFigs. 2a and 2b show the inverse relaxation times\n1/T1 and 1/T2 as a function of the iron molar\nconcentration [Fe] for the citrate-coated nanoparticles\n21,22\nand for the nanoparticle-copolymer aggregates\n.\nSamples were prepared at X = 1 for PTEA5K-bPAM30K and at X = 2 for PTEA11K-b-PAM30K, both at\nconcentration c = 0.2 wt. %. In order to monitor the\ninversion-recovery and spin echo pulse sequences,\nthe solutions were diluted by a factor of 10 to 1000.\nFor these experiments, light scattering was used to\nverify that the size and microstructure of the polymernanoparticle complexes were not modified under\ndilution. In Figs. 2a and 2b, the inverse relaxation\ntimes were found to vary linearly with the iron\nconcentration, according to the following equation\n[23] :\n\n1\n1\n= R1,2 \" [Fe ] + 0\nT1,2 ([Fe])\nT1,2\n\n(1)\n\nwhere R1 and R2 are the longitudinal and transverse\n0 are the\nrelaxivities, respectively. The intercepts 1/ T1,2\n!\nproton inverse relaxation times in pure water. At a\nLarmor frequency of 20 MHz, we found T10 = 4.0 s\nand T20 = 1.6 s. The data in Fig.! 2a shows that with\nincreasing cluster size, the longitudinal relaxivity R1\nexhibits a slight decrease, but remains\naround 20 s\n!\n1\n-1\n*mM . The transverse relaxivity R2 on the contrary\n-1\n-1\nincreases noticeably. R2 starts at 39 \u00b1 2 s *mM for\nthe bare nanoparticles, rises up to 74 \u00b1 4 for clusters\nprepared with the 5K-30K copolymer, and culminates\nat 162 \u00b1 4 for clusters made with the 11K-30K chains.\nSuch values for R1 and R2 suggest that the polymernanoparticle aggregates created by electrostatic selfassembly could serve as T2 contrast agents [21,22].\nThe results reported in Figs. 2 support recent studies\n\n\fby Martina et al. [24], Manuel-Perez et al. [25] and\nRoch and coworkers [26]. These reports all indicate\nthat clusters of magnetic nanoparticles have\nenhanced transverse relaxivities R2, and relaxivity\nratios R2/R1.\n\nFigure 2 : Inverse longitudinal and transverse\nrelaxation times 1/T1 (a) and 1/T2 (b) for mixed\ncopolymer-particle hybrids as a function of the iron\nmolar concentration [Fe]. The straight lines were\ncalculated according to Eq. 1. The solutions were\nprepared at the ratio where all the components\npresent in solution associate to form complexes.\n\nMagnetic resonance Imaging\nIn order to assess the role of the neutral corona in in\nvivo conditions, dilute solutions of \u03b3-Fe2O3\uf8e6PTEA5K-bPAM30K were injected intravenously to 300 g Wistar\nrats (Harlan Winkelmann, Borchen, Germany). The\nvisualization of the liver was monitored by spatially\nresolved resonance magnetic imaging performed in a\n3 T magnetic resonance scanner (Sigma 3T94,\nGeneral Electric Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI) [27]. The\ndose of coated injected nanoparticles were 0.6 mg\nand 1.2 mg of iron per kilogram of body weight. The\nresults obtained with the electrostatic complexes were\ncompared with a commercially available standard\n(Resovist, carboxydextran coated iron oxide\nnanoparticles). The T2-weighted images of the liver\nwere recorded before injection, 15 minutes and 60\nminutes after injection. As illustrated in Fig. 3, at 15\nmn post-injection the liver has darkened considerably\n\nfor both Resovist and coated nanoparticle clusters.\nThe contrast enhancement of the liver in the T2weighted sequences indicated that there was\naccumulation of magnetic material in the liver. In other\nterm, the neutral polyacrylamide corona was not\nsufficient to avoid, or even to slow down the capture\nand removal of the contrast agents by the immune\nsystem of the rat. Finally, it is important to recall that\nin MRI the measured signal does not originate from\nthe contrast agent only. Instead, the technique\nmeasured the signal from the tissue (relaxation time\nof water protons in the tissue) which might be altered\nby the presence of the contrast agent. This is the\nreason why the liver appeared grey in the native\nscans. T2-relaxations are prolonged by the presence\nof magnetic inhomogeneities caused by the particles,\ngenerating additional contrast to the environment.\nTherefore, the signal at least depends on the tissue\nsignal and on the magnetic properties of the contrast\nagent. The darkness of the final image also depends\non how the material is distributed in the tissue. More\nwork is needed to quantify the iron oxide\nconcentration in the liver as a function of time.\n\nFigure 3 : Magnetic resonance signal intensity of liver\nof rats in T2-weighted sequences. Images were\nacquired before and 15 min after intravenous injection\nof nanoparticles in a concentration of 1.2 mg of Fe/kg\nof body weight.\n\nConclusion\nIn this paper, we investigated the formation of new\nhybrid aggregates comprising charged copolymers\nand nanoparticles. The mechanism at the origin of the\nself-assembly is based on electrostatic adsorption and\ncharge compensation between oppositely charged\nspecies. The systems put under scrutiny were\ncationic-neutral hydrosoluble block copolymers and\n6.3 nm diameter superparamagnetic \u03b3-Fe2O3\nnanoparticles. The properties of the nanoparticles\nclusters coated with a neutral corona were tested in\nrelaxometry and in in vivo magnetic resonance\nimaging experiments. A significant result is that the\n\n\ftransverse relaxivity, R2 is noticeably increased with\nthe size of the magnetic clusters. The ratio R2/R1,\nwhich is usually an important parameter in estimating\nthe efficiency between T2-contrast agents, increases\nfrom 1.7 for the citrate-coated nanoparticles to 9.3 for\n\u03b3-Fe2O3\uf8e6PTEA11K-b-PAM30K. T2-weighted sequences\non rat livers have however indicated that after\nintravenous injection, these clusters are filtrated by\nthe liver as rapidly as a commercial product.\n\nReferences\n* New address : Pharmaceutical Nanotechnology\nBoehringer Ingelheim Pharma GmbH & Co.
