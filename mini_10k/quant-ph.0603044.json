Hendrickson\nUniversity of Maryland, Baltimore County, Baltimore, MD 21250 USA\nIn electromagnetically-induced transparency (EIT), the scattering rate of a probe beam is greatly\nreduced due to destructive interference between two dressed atomic states produced by a strong laser\nbeam. Here we show that a similar reduction in the single-photon scattering rate can be achieved by\ntuning a probe beam to be halfway between the resonant frequencies of two modes of a cavity. This\ntechnique is expected to be useful in enhancing two-photon absorption while reducing losses due to\nsingle-photon scattering.\nIn electromagnetically-induced transparency (EIT)\n[1,2], an atomic medium with a large scattering rate at\none frequency can be made transparent by applying a\nlaser beam at a different frequency. The reduction in the\nscattering rate is due to destructive interference between\nthe scattering amplitudes from two dressed atomic states\nthat are created by the laser beam. Here we show that a\nsimilar effect can be obtained without the need for a\nlaser beam if the frequency of an incident beam of light\nis tuned to be halfway between two of the resonant\nmodes of a cavity. This allows the two-photon\nabsorption rate to be enhanced while simultaneously\nreducing the loss due to single-photon scattering. Aside\nfrom its fundamental interest, this effect is expected to\nbe of practical use in the design of Zeno logic gates\nbased on two-photon absorption [3].\nThe system of interest here is illustrated in Fig.\n1. An optical waveguide containing a small number of\nincident photons is coupled to a ring resonator, which in\nturn is coupled to N A three-level atoms via its\nevanescent field. It will be assumed that there is no\ndirect coupling of the photons in the waveguide to the\natoms, so that no loss can occur unless a photon has\nbeen coupled into the resonator. The atoms are located\nnear the coupling to the waveguide in order to ensure\nthat the matrix elements are the same for adjacent\nresonator modes. Our goal is to achieve strong\nabsorption when two photons are present in the\nwaveguide with little or no loss due to scattering when\nonly a single photon is present. It will be found that the\nloss due to single-photon scattering can be eliminated if\nthe frequency of the incident photons is tuned to be\nhalfway between two adjacent cavity modes.\nRing resonators can have large intrinsic quality\nfactors (Q values), in which case there would be very\nlittle response to an incident field tuned between two of\nthe resonant modes. But if the coupling between the\nwaveguide and the ring resonator is very strong, the Q\ncan be reduced (spoiled) to the point that the linewidth\nis comparable to the free spectral range of the cavity.\nJohnsson et al. [4] considered the use of EIT in twophoton absorption based on a conventional approach in\nwhich a strong laser beam is applied to a double-lambda\n\natomic system.\nOpatrny and Welsch [5] have\npreviously discussed an enhanced form of EIT using the\ncoupled modes of two different cavities and a strong\npump beam (laser). Classical interference effects\ninvolving two different cavities (but no atoms) that are\nsomewhat analogous to EIT have also been investigated\n[6-8]. Our approach has the potential advantage of\navoiding any background counts due to the laser beam,\nwhich may be important when dealing with singlephoton signals. In addition, confining the photons to the\nsmall mode volume of the ring resonator enhances the\nmagnitude of the two-photon absorption and is wellsuited for quantum computing applications [3].\nenergy\n\nmR\nlR\n\natoms\n\u045b\u03c9\u03b3\n\n0R\n\nFig. 1.

The ring resonator has\nresonant modes labeled lR that correspond to lR \u03bb = C ,\nwhere C is the circumference of the ring and \u03bb is the\nwavelength. Neglecting dispersion, the energy E (lR )\nof a single photon in the state\n\nlR\n\nis given by\n\nE (lR ) = lR \u045b\u03c9 0 , where \u045b is Planck's constant divided by\n2\u03c0 and \u03c9 0 is the angular frequency of the fundamental\nmode. The energy \u045b\u03c9\u03b3 of the incident photons can be\n\nwritten as \u045b\u03c9\u03b3 = E + \u03b4 , where \u03b4\n\nis an adjustable\n\n\f2\nparameter and E = (lR \u045b\u03c9 0 + mR \u045b\u03c9 0 ) / 2 is the average\nenergy of two adjacent modes lR and mR = lR + 1 , as\nshown in Fig. 2. The resonator state lR , mR with one\nphoton in modes lR and mR has an energy of 2E , and\nthe state 2mR with two photons in mode mR will also\nplay an important role. For simplicity, the other modes\nof the ring resonator are not shown in Fig 2.\nThe ground state and first two excited states of the\natoms will be denoted by 0 A , 1A , and 2 A ,\nrespectively.

Quantum interference between the resonator\nmodes lR and mR eliminates single-photon scattering by\nthe atoms in analogy with EIT, while strong two-photon\nabsorption can still occur via intermediate states such as\n2 mR .\n\nAll of the atoms are confined to a sufficiently small\nregion that exp{i[k (lR ) \u2212 k (mR )]x} \u0018 1 , where x is the\ndistance around the ring.

(The numerical values as a\nfunction of atomic density will be discussed below.) It\ncan be seen that the scattering rate goes to zero for\n\u03b4 = 0 due to the cancellation between the two\nintermediate states. Since the cancellation occurs\n\n\f3\nbetween two existing states, this effect is more\nanalogous to a Fano resonance [13] than EIT. The\nscattering rate is further reduced by the large value of\n\u03941 regardless of the cancellation of amplitudes.

But to lowest order in perturbation theory, that\nprocess is also suppressed by the cancellation of\nprobability amplitudes, since the intermediate states for\ntwo-photon absorption of that kind are the same as in\nEq. (3).\nThis problem can be avoided if we include the\npossibility of two-photon absorption via the resonator\nstate 2mR , for example. There is only one probability\namplitude for this transition since both photons are\nabsorbed into mode m of the ring resonator, and no\ncancellation of probability amplitudes occurs.

(8) includes only the contribution from the two\nintermediate states with the smallest detunings, which\ngive most of the contribution to the probability\namplitude.\nThe total probability amplitude was\ndetermined by numerically summing the contributions\nfrom all possible intermediate states li and l j , lk ,\nwhich gave a two-photon absorption rate that is 52%\nlarger than that from Eq. (8). The dashed line in Fig. 3\nshows the total two-photon absorption rate as a function\nof the photon tuning parameter \u03b4 for the case of\n\u045b\u03b3 2 = 0.05 \u00d7 \u045b\u03c90 . It can be seen that the two-photon\nabsorption rate is a maximum at \u03b4 = 0 where the\nsingle-photon scattering rate is zero.\nThe coupling between state 2mR and the states\n1A\n\nfor each of the N A atoms will be too large for\n\nstandard perturbation theory to be valid if the density of\natoms is sufficiently large [14]. In that case, the rate of\ntwo-photon absorption can be determined by first\ncalculating the exact eigenstates of the Hamiltonian \u0124 0\ndefined to include the diagonal elements of \u0124 as well\nas the M 1 term that couples those states. Perturbation\ntheory can then be performed using those eigenstates as\na basis with a perturbation Hamiltonian H\u02c6 ' that\nincludes the remaining M W and M 2 terms, which are\nindependent of the atomic density. The probability\namplitude for an atom to be in state 1A will be denoted\n\n\f4\n\nfor state 2mR . Schrodinger's equation for \u0124 0 gives\ni\u045bc\u0005 2 m = (2 E + \u045b\u03c90 )c2 m + 2 N A M 1c1 A\n\n(9)\n\ni\u045bc\u00051 A = (2 E + \u045b\u03c90 / 2 + \u03941 )c1 A + 2 M 1c2 m\n\nIf we make a change of variables to c '2 m \u2261 N A c2 m and\nM '1 \u2261 N A M 1 , then Eq. (9) can be rewritten as\ni\u045b\n\n\u23a4 \u23a1 c '2 m \u23a4\n2M '1\nd \u23a1c '2 m \u23a4 \u23a1(2 E + \u045b\u03c90 )\n\u23a5\u23a2\n\u23a2c \u23a5=\u23a2\n\u23a5\ndt \u23a3 1 A \u23a6 \u23a2\u23a3\n2 M '1\n(2 E + \u045b\u03c90 / 2 + \u03941 ) \u23a5\u23a6 \u23a3 c1 A \u23a6\n\n(10)\n\nwhich is equivalent to an effective two-level system.\nThe eigenstates of Eq. (10) were found analytically and\ncombined with the remaining states ( 0R and 2 A ) to\nform a new set of basis states for the perturbation\ncalculation in M W and M 2 .\nIn order to estimate the magnitude of these effects,\nwe considered a simple example of a ring resonator\nformed from a fused silica fiber with diameter d in the\nshape of a ring (toroid) of diameter D \u0015 d . This\nprovides an approximation to the whispering gallery\nmodes of toroidal resonators [15]. In the limit D \u0015 d ,\nthe electric field is that of a straight fiber for which\nthere is an exact solution to Maxwell's equations [16].\nThis allows a determination of the matrix elements\nG G\nG G\nM 1 =< d1 \u22c5 E > and M 2 =< d 2 \u22c5 E > . For this example,\nwe assumed that d = 0.35 \u03bc m and D = 50 \u03bc m , which\ncorresponds to a mode spacing of \u03c9 0 / 2\u03c0 = 1.8 \u00d7 10\n\n12\n\nHz\n\nand an effective mode volume Vm = 7.6 \u00d7 10\u221217 m3 [9].\nThe coupling between the waveguide and the cavity was\ntaken to be M W = \u045b\u03c90 / 3 .\nIt was also assumed that the resonator is surrounded\nby rubidium vapor at density \u03c1 with N A = \u03c1Vm . The\nlevels 1A\n\nand\n\n2A\n\nwere taken to be the usual\n\nrubidium S \u2192 P \u2192 D transition [17] used in precise\nwavelength measurements with \u03b3 1 = \u03b3 2 \u0018 \u03c0 \u00d7 108 sec-1.\nFor this series of transitions, the two-photon absorption\nresonance is at 778 nm and the detuning \u03941 corresponds\nto a wavelength difference of 2.1 nm.\nThe two-photon absorption rate calculated in this\nway is shown in Fig. 4. At densities up to ~ 1015 cm-1,\nthe straight line nature of the plot is identical to Eq. (8),\nwhile R2 saturates at a value of 4.7 \u00d7 109 sec-1 for larger\ndensities. Roughly speaking, the saturation is due to the\nfact that a single photon can be absorbed in a virtual\n\nprocess by at most one atom at a time regardless of how\nmany atoms are present. For comparison purposes, the\nsingle-photon scattering rate at \u03c1 = 1015 cm-3 is\nR1 = 2.3 \u00d7 107 sec-1 for \u03b4 / \u045b\u03c90 = 0.2 , which can be\neffectively eliminated using the quantum interference\neffects discussed above. The intrinsic losses in a high-Q\nring resonator can be below 105 sec-1 , which suggests\nthat two-photon absorption rates that are orders of\nmagnitude larger than the single-photon loss should be\nexperimentally achievable using these techniques.\nIn summary, tuning between two resonant modes of\na cavity with a small mode volume can result in twophoton absorption rates that are much larger than the\nsingle-photon loss. These techniques are expected to be\nof practical use in the implementation of Zeno logic\ngates [3] and single-photon sources based on twophoton absorption. Although we have not discussed it\nhere, similar techniques could also be used to produce\nnonlinear phase shifts with low single-photon loss.\n10\n\nLog(R2) (sec-1)\n\nby c1 A , while c2 m will denote the probability amplitude\n\n9\n\n8\n\n7\n\n6\n12\n\n14\n\n16\n\n18\n\nLog(r) (cm-3)\n\nFig. 4.
