Introduction\nSince the pioneering work of Pecora and Carroll, chaos synchronization based cryptography\nhas become a very active research area [1]. However, investigations have shown that a great\n*\n\nCorresponding author. E-mail address: jtzhou@seu.edu.cn.\n1\n\n\fnumber of low-dimensional chaotic cryptosystems are fundamentally flawed by a lack of security\nand various attacks such as nonlinear forecasting, return map, adaptive parameter estimation, error\nfunction attack (EFA), and inverse computation based chosen cipher attack, may succeed in\nrecovering messages from the chaotic ciphers [2-6]. Therefore, recent studies have focused on\nhigh-dimensional chaotic systems, which have more complex dynamics, higher sensitivity to\nparameter mismatches and better random properties [7-12]. Particularly, OCML system\nincorporating with basic algebraic operations such as INT and MOD is found to be able to\nconstruct cryptosystems with high practical security [9-12]. S-box algebraic operation and\nbit-reverse operation are then introduced into such a cryptosystem and reaches higher security\nwith low additional computation expense [10-12]. Furthermore, a two-dimensional map lattice is\nused for obtaining better efficiency [12]. It has been stated that this class of cryptosystem has\noptimal overall cryptographic properties, even much better than advanced encryption standard\n(AES) in security, performance efficiency, and robustness against channel noise, and has been\napplied to practical voice communication [12-13].\nMeanwhile, various existing cryptanalysis methods have been implemented to evaluate the\nsecurity of this class of cryptosystems [2-6]. However, the statistical property based attacks are not\neffective because of the excellent random statistics of the generated key stream [12]. The\nparameter estimation based attacks do not work because there are no observable state variables\navailable for constructing convergent cost functions [4,12]. Moreover, one of the most successful\nattacks, EFA cannot break the system because of two facts [5,12]. Firstly, the error function\npossesses numerous minima, which leads to an erroneous convergence at one of the local minima.\nSecondly, the needle-like basin structure precludes effective finding of the tendency towards the\n\n2\n\n\fsecret key by exhaustive searching. Recently, Hu et al. proposed a quite effective chosen cipher\nattack by using a constant as driving to the receiver [6]. It has been stated that this attack can\nextract the secret key in prototypical scheme proposed in [9] with relatively much less cost (about\n280 iterations for four keys) than that of EFA (about 1036 iterations for four keys) [10]. However,\n\nthe computational cost is still quite large and no detailed analyses can be found. In this paper, we\nintroduce the differential mechanism into the constant-driving chosen cipher attack, and present a\ndifferential-like chosen cipher attack. Under constant driving, the prototypical scheme proposed in\n[9] degenerates to be one-dimensional, thus after convergence, it will not be sensitive to the slight\nperturbation on driving in specially selected intervals. It can be shown that the key stream\ndifference before and after the perturbation is a smooth and simple-structured function with\nrespect to the secret key on the whole key space. Therefore, intruder can perturb the driving\nslightly and observe the key stream difference, and then use a simple optimal searching algorithm\nto find the key with desired precision only with hundreds of iterations.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we review the spatiotemporal chaos-based\ncryptosystem incorporating OCML with INT and MOD operations in brief. Differential-like\nchosen cipher attack together with the experimental results is presented in section 3. Section 4\nconcludes the paper and some suggestions for further improving the security are outlined.\n\n2. OCML based spatiotemporally chaotic cryptosystem\nThe cryptosystem proposed in [9] uses OCML as the core operation, with the additional INT\nand MOD operations for keeping robustness of communication against channel noise, and greatly\nenhancing the sensitivity of chaos synchronization to parameter mismatch, respectively.\nDecryption transformation:\n\n3\n\n\fyn+1 ( j ) = (1 \u2212 \u03b5 ) f j [ yn ( j )] + \u03b5 f j [ yn ( j \u2212 1)] , f j ( x) = (3.75 + b j / 4) x(1 \u2212 x) , j = 1, 2,..., m\n\n(1a)\n\nyn+1 ( j ) = (1 \u2212 \u03b5 ) f [ yn ( j )] + \u03b5 f [ yn ( j \u2212 1)] , f ( x) = 4 x(1 \u2212 x) , j = m + 1,..., N\n\n(1b)\n\nK n' = int( yn ( N ) \u00d7 2 \u03bc ) mod 2\u03c5 , I n' = ( Sn \u2212 K n' ) mod 2\u03c5\n\n(1c)\n\nyn (0) = S n / 2\u03c5\n\n(1d)\n\nwhere K n' , I n' ,\n\nand S n denote the key stream, the recovered plaintext, and the cipher,\n\nrespectively. The control parameters b = (b1 , b2 \"bm ) serving as the secret keys can be wildly\nchosen in the interval (0,1) . The other parameters such as coupling strength, system size etc.,\nwhich can be opened to intruder, are typically set as \u03b5 = 0.99 , \u03bc = 52 , \u03c5 = 32 , m = 4 , N = 25 .\nThe dynamic forms of the transmitter are exactly the same as those of the receiver with yn ( j ) ,\nK n' , I n' , and b = (b1 , b2 \"bm ) replaced by xn ( j ) , K n , I n , and\n\na = (a1 , a2 \" am ) , respectively.\n\nAs the receiver is driven by the transmitted signal as yn (0) = xn (0) = Sn / 2v , when b = a , the\nreceiver can reach chaos synchronization with the transmitter, and successfully recover the true\nplaintext as yn ( N ) = xn ( N ) , K n\u2032 = K n , I n\u2032 = I n .\nWith the requirement of public-structure and chosen-ciphertext, EFA can be used for\ninvestigating the system's key sensitivity [5].\ne(b1 ) =\n\n1\n2v T\n\nT\n\n\u2211 I\u2032 \u2212 I\nn =1\n\nn\n\n(2)\n\nn\n\nwhere I n\u2032 can be computed by intruder from a fake receiver with designed ciphertext S n and\ntest key b1 . Basin structure of e(b1 ) vs b1 is shown in Fig.1. [10] has found that the basin width\ncan be empirically calculated as W \u221d T 0.3 , where T is the total number of observed plaintext\npairs for each test. As away from the basin, e(b1 ) is flat with certain fluctuations, the minimal\ncomputational cost for finding four secret keys can be roughly calculated as\n\n1\nW\n\n\u2248 1036 iterations.\n\nIt should be noted that, in the OCML system without INT and MOD operations, large\n\n4\n\n\fcoupling size can also ensure satisfactory confusion and diffusion, but it also prolongs the\nsynchronization time and intensifies the error propagation effect. But with the INT and MOD\noperation, it is easy to obtain equivalent confusion and diffusion by coupling much less number of\nlattices, and more important, the resistance against various attacks can be greatly enhanced. In fact,\nseveral attacks such as parameter estimation attack, inverse computation based chosen cipher\nattack can be used to break OCML system without INT and MOD operations, but these methods\nwill fail when with such algebraic operations [4,6,12]. The most important reason is that the state\nof the last lattice is masked and 2\u03bc \u2212\u03c5 computations are needed to derive it from the available key\nstream K n . For parameter estimation, it is impossible to construct a convergent cost function.\nWhile for inverse computation, 2\u03bc \u2212\u03c5 computations significantly increase the number of equations\nfor deriving the secret key, and large coupling size further enhances such difficulties. It will be\nshown later that even with currently strongest chosen cipher attack proposed by Hu et al., the\nminimal computation cost will reach the level of 280 for four parameters [6].\n\n3.\n\nDifferential-like chosen cipher attack\nIt is well known that chosen cipher attacks are among the strongest attacks if we classify the\n\nintensity of various evaluations. The intruder can obtain temporary access to the decryption\nmachinery, which enables him to choose a cipher string and construct the corresponding plaintext.\nRecently, Hu et al. suggested an effective chosen cipher attack method to evaluate various chaos\nsynchronization based systems by using a constant as the driving [6]. Under such constant driving,\nthe response system will asymptotically converge to certain fixed point related to the driving, thus,\nthe secret key can be recovered by using inverse computations [6]. In fact, the convergent property\nalso holds for the OCML system with INT and MOD algebraic operations. When driven by a\n\n5\n\n\fconstant, for the first lattice,\nyn +1 (1) \u2212 yn (1) = (1 \u2212 \u03b5 ) f1[ yn (1)] \u2212 f1[ yn \u22121 (1)] < 4(1 \u2212 \u03b5 ) yn (1) \u2212 yn \u22121 (1)\n\n(3)\n\nAs 0 < 4(1 \u2212 \u03b5 ) \u0013 1 , we have lim yn+1 (1) \u2212 yn (1) = 0 . Repeating the similar computations, we\nn \u2192\u221e\n\ncan successively prove: lim yn+1 (i ) \u2212 yn (i ) = 0 i = 2,3...N . Hence all sites will converge to certain\nn \u2192\u221e\n\nfix points when the driving signal is a constant, irrespective how large the coupling size is.\nHowever such inverse computation based attack is not computationally feasible to break the\nsystem with INT and MOD operations, mainly because of the 2\u03bc \u2212\u03c5 multi-solutions from the\navailable key stream K n to yn ( N ) , making the number of equations to derive the secret key\nextremely large. Moreover, large coupling size further increases the complexity of resolving such\nequations. Since the computational cost added by the coupling size is neglectable compared with\nthat induced by MOD operation, the total cost can be roughly estimated as 2m ( \u03bc \u2212\u03c5 ) = 280 , obviously\nvery large but still much less than that of EFA 1036 .\nThe inverse computation based chosen cipher attack does not fully make use of the properties\nunder constant driving. In fact, it can be proved that the previous high-dimensional system will\nbecome one-dimensional after convergence, hence no more extremely sensitive to small\nperturbation on the driving. In the following section, for simplicity while without loosing\ngenerality, we take the most sensitive parameter b1 in the first right term of the first state\nequation as the secret key to explain the differential-like chosen cipher attack. The other nonlinear\nparameters including b1 in the second term of the first state equation are all set to be public\nconstant 1. Because the cipher can be arbitrarily chosen, we take yd = 4 yn (0)(1 \u2212 yn (0)) as the\nequivalent driving of the system. As after convergence all the state variables are constant, from Eq.\n(1) we can directly derive the converged state of all sites as:\n\n6\n\n\fy1 =\n\nyj =\n\nR ' + R '2 + 4\u03b5 ( R ' + 1) yd\n= \u03c6 ( yd ) , R ' = (3.75 + b1 / 4)(1 \u2212 \u03b5 ) \u2212 1\n2( R ' + 1)\n\nR + R 2 + 16\u03b5 ( R + 1) y j \u22121 (1 \u2212 y j \u22121 )\n2( R + 1)\n\n(4a)\n\n= \u03c6 ( y j \u22121 ) , R = 4(1 \u2212 \u03b5 ) \u2212 1\n\n(4b)\n\nConsequently, y2 = \u03c6 ( y1 ) = \u03c6[\u03c6 ( yd )] , y3 = \u03c6 2 [\u03c6 ( yd )] , ... , y N = \u03c6 N \u22121[\u03c6 ( yd )]\n\n(5)\n\nIt is clear to find that the previous high-dimensional system becomes one-dimensional, no\nmatter how complex the function \u03c6 N \u22121[\u03c6 ( x)] may be. From Fig. 2, we also see that there exist\nsome narrow intervals around 0.495, in which the function \u03c6 N \u22121[\u03c6 ( x)] is slowly changing. It is an\nindication that when the driving is chosen in these intervals, the system is easier to handle.\nOn the other hand, although according to Eq. (1c) there are 2\u03bc \u2212\u03c5 = 220 possible solutions\nfrom K N to yn ( N ) , the difference between two variables, say yn ( N ) and yn' ( N ) can be\nuniquely determined by their corresponding key stream K n'\n\nand\n\nK n'' , provided that\n\nyn' ( N ) \u2212 yn ( N ) < 2\u221220 , as Eq. (6) shown. The observable difference will be shown later of great\n\nsignificance in finding the secret key.\nyn' ( N ) \u2212 yn ( N ) = ( K '' \u2212 K ' ) / 2\u03bc\n\n(6)\n\nWhen a constant yd is used as the driving to make the receiver converge, we take\nK1 = int( yN \u00d7 2 \u03bc ) mod 2\u03c5 as the converged key stream. After convergence, a slight perturbation is\n\nadded to yd at time t, i.e., yd' = yd + \u03c4 , \u03c4 \u0013 1 . At time t + N a changed key stream\nK 2 = int( yN' \u00d7 2 \u03bc ) mod 2\u03c5 can be observed. The function g (b, yd ) = K 2 \u2212 K1 is defined as Instant\n\nPerturbation Function (IPF), which describes the dependence between the parameter and the key\nstream difference before and after the perturbation. The perturbation \u03c4 = 2\u221236 if not specified,\nwhich ensures that under certain constant driving yd , g (b, yd ) < 2\u221220 holds for any b \u2208 (0,1) .\nFurthermore, we can prove that, for every secret key b1 \u2208 (0,1) , there exists at least one\n\n7\n\n\fdriving yd 1 such that g (b1 , yd 1 ) = 0 , i.e., no difference can be observed before and after the\nperturbation. We call the zone consisting of such points (b1 , yd 1 ) the silent position. The state\nequations after the perturbation are shown in Eq. (7). Note that all the first terms remain\nunchanged because the perturbation takes effect to them from the next time.\ny1' = (1 \u2212 \u03b5 )(3.75 + b1 / 4) y1 (1 \u2212 y1 ) + \u03b5 ( yd 1 + \u03c4 )\n\n(7a)\n\ny 'j = 4(1 \u2212 \u03b5 ) y j (1 \u2212 y j ) + 4\u03b5 y 'j\u22121 (1 \u2212 y 'j\u22121 ) , j = 2,3,..., N\n\n(7b)\n\nFor ek = yk' \u2212 yk , from Eq. (1) and (7) we have the difference dynamics:\ne1 = \u03b5\u03c4 , e j = 4\u03b5 e j \u22121 (1 \u2212 2 y j \u22121 ) \u2212 4\u03b5 (e j \u22121 ) 2 , j = 2,3,..., N\n\n(8)\n\nAs \u03c4 \u0013 1 , (e j \u22121 ) 2 = 0 in practical computation. Thus, Eq. (8) becomes\ne j = 4\u03b5 e j \u22121 (1 \u2212 2 y j \u22121 ) , j = 2,3,..., N\n\n(9)\n\nConsequently, we have:\ne j = \u03b5\u03c4 (4\u03b5 ) j \u22121 \u220f i =1 (1 \u2212 2 yi ) , j = 2,3,..., N\nj \u22121\n\n(10)\n\nHence, any y j = 0.5 , j = 1, 2,..., N \u2212 1 leads to g (b1 , yd 1 ) = 0 . Assuming y1 = 0.5 , from Eq.\n(1) we have: yd 1 = [2 \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03b5 )(3.75 + b1 / 4)]/ 4\u03b5 . When b1 is freely chosen in (0,1) , the range of\nyd 1 can be calculated as \u03a6 = (0.49494949495,0.49558080808) , which is around 0.495 (that's why\n\nwe choose the interval around 0.495 in Fig. 2). Therefore, for any b1 \u2208 (0,1) we can find at least\none yd 1 in \u03a6 , satisfying g (b1 , yd 1 ) = 0 . In Fig. 3 we plot the three-dimensional figure of\ng (b, yd ) / 2 \u03bc in terms of the secret key chosen in (0,1) and the driving in \u03a6 . The bottom of the\n\nmesh represents the silent position. It can be clearly seen that there is at least one yd 1 for every\nsecret key corresponding to the silent state, which experimentally proves our above conclusion.\nSince \u03c6 N \u22121[\u03c6 ( x)] is slowly changing in \u03a6 , as Fig. 2 shown, a simple optimal searching\nalgorithm shown in Eq. (11) can be used to search one appropriate yd 1 in \u03a6 .\n\n8\n\n\fyd 1 (k + 1) = yd 1 (k ) + \u03b3 ( K 2 \u2212 K1 ) / 2\u03c5\n\n(11)\n\nMoreover, if there is one point (b1 , yd 1 ) satisfying g (b1 , yd 1 ) = 0 , then there exists one line\nY = AX + B containing the point (b1 , yd 1 ) , on which any point, say (b* , y* ) , satisfies g (b* , y* ) = 0 .\n\nIf b1 and yd 1 are used as the secret key and the constant driving, respectively, the converged\nstate of the first lattice is y1 = \u03c6 (b1 , yd 1 ) , shown in Eq. (4a). From Eq. (5) and (10), we know that\ng (b1 , yd 1 ) is uniquely determined by y1 . Hence, any point (b* , y* ) making y1 |b =b , y = y = \u03c6 (b1 , yd 1 )\n*\n\n*\n\nd\n\nleads to g (b* , y* ) = g (b1 , yd 1 ) = 0 . Then from Eq. (4a), we can obtain the line equation:\ny* = \u03c6 (b1 , yd 1 ) / \u03b5 + \u03c6 (b1 , yd 1 )(1 \u2212 y1 )(1 \u2212 \u03b5 )(3.75 + b* ) / \u03b5\n\n(12)\n\nTherefore, there is a linear dependence between the secret key and the driving corresponding\nto the silent state. As a result, the task of finding the secret key can be converted to find the\ncorresponding driving. We can use the iterative method described in Eq. (11) with the middle point\nof \u03a6 as the initial value to search the corresponding driving in \u03a6 for every test key in (0,1) .\nAs Fig. 4 shown, all the possible points (b* , y* ) belong to five lines. We can experimentally\ncalculate the equations of line 1-5, results averaging over 100 realizations shown in Table 1.\nTherefore, the procedure of finding the secret key by using differential-like chosen cipher\nattack can be as follows (taking a randomly generated number b1 = 0.7865302612 for example).\nStep 1: Search a constant driving for the authorized receiver using Eq. (11). The step size\n\u03b3 = 0.0001 . After about 100 iterations we can obtain yd 1 = 0.495206963987366133 .\n\nStep 2: Analytically calculate the possible secret keys by inserting yd1 to the line equations.\nFive corresponding solutions can be obtained, -0.2283274311, 0.3978096430, 0.5934578440,\n0.7865302612, and 1.412698303. Obviously one of the points in {0.3978096430, 0.5934578440,\n0.7865302612} is the secret key because only these three points are in (0,1) . Hence, if we\n\n9\n\n\fconstruct three fake receivers using these three keys, we can make sure that one of them will\ncorrectly recover the plaintext, shown in Fig. 5.\n\n4.\n\nConclusion\nThe OCML based cryptosystem incorporating with algebraic operations has excellent overall\n\ncryptographic properties. This class of cryptosystem has been shown to be resistible against all the\nexisting attack strategies. In this paper, we present a differential-like chosen cipher attack to break\nthe prototypical scheme of this class of system cooperating OCML with INT and MOD operations.\nThe most important factor leading to the success is that the high-dimensional system degenerates\ninto one-dimensional when driven by a constant, thus no more sensitive to slight perturbations on\nthe driving. The numerical experiments results also have demonstrated the capability.\nMoreover, the overall security of this class of cryptosystem can be highly improved by using\ndeterministic randomness and its realizable asymptotic model called Lissajious map [14-15].\nActually, similar concept has also been used to enhance chaoticity of spatiotemporal chaos by Li\net al. recently [16]. Another spatiotemporal chaos based cryptosystem built on Lissajious map has\nalready been designed. Our current results show that for the modified cryptosystem, the parameter\nsensitivity can reach the computational precision 2\u221252 , when the coupling size N is only three, and\nparallel encryption is feasible even in one-dimensional structure. More important, the improved\ncryptosystem can effectively resist the differential-like chosen cipher attack because the\nperturbation function becomes quite complex. The detailed analyses will be given in our\nforthcoming paper.\n\nAcknowledgement\nThis work was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 60133010\n\n10\n\n\fand 60102011, the National High Technology Project of China under Grant 2002AA143010 and\n2003AA143040, and the Excellent Young Teachers Program of Southeast University.\n\nReference\n[1] Pecora LM, Caroll TL.
