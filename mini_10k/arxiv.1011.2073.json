The polarization degree is very sensitive to\nthe spin of black hole - for Kerr rotating hole the polarization is higher than for Schwarzschild\nnon-rotating one if both holes have the same luminosities and masses. The reason of this effect\nis that the radius of the first stable orbit for non-rotating hole is equal to three gravitational\nradiuses, and for fast rotating Kerr hole is approximately 6 times lesser. Magnetic field, decreasing from first stable orbits, is much larger in the region of escaping of optical radiation\nfor the case of Schwarzschild hole than for Kerr one. Large magnetic field gives rise to large\ndepolarization of radiation due to Faraday rotation effect. This explains the mentioned result.\nIt seems that the ensemble of objects with observed polarization mostly consists of Kerr black\nholes.\nPACS numbers: 95.30Gv, 98.62Js, 98.62Mv, 98.62En\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe estimation of the black hole spin, i.e. the dimensionless parameter a\u2217 = J/Jmax = Jc/GM 2 ,\nwhich determines the angular momentum, is very difficult from observational point of view. To some\nextent the observation of luminosity Lbol = \u03b5\u1e40 c2 of accretion disk allow us qualitatively estimate\nthis parameter, if we compare this value with theoretical models predictions. Here \u1e40 is the mass\naccretion velocity and c being light velocity. Dimensionless parameter \u03b5 demonstrates what part\nof mass transforms to the radiation energy. For Schwarzschild's black hole (a\u2217 = 0) the theoretical\nestimation gives \u03b5 = 0.057, and for fast rotating Kerr hole (a\u2217 \u2248 1) the value \u03b5 = 0.42 (See Blandford\n(1990), Krolik (2007) and Shapiro (2007)). So, one can qualitatively consider that the bright objects\nmost probably correspond to the Kerr black holes, and the objects with weak luminosity correspond\nto Schwarzschild ones. Evidently, any other technique to estimate the parameter a\u2217 , may be only\nqualitatively, will be of interest in this situation.\nIn this paper we demonstrate that the degree of linear polarization from magnetized accretion\ndisk strongly depends on the parameter a\u2217 . We suppose that the main part of polarization in\nvisual range is due to multiple scattering of radiation in optically thick magnetized accretion disks.\nIn our model we accept that the radiation sources are located far from the disk's surface and,\n\u2217\n\nE-mail: nsilant@bk.ru\n\n1\n\n\fconsequently, the linear polarization describes by known Milne's problem for conservative magnetized\natmosphere. Note that for non-magnetized electron atmosphere the maximal degree of polarization\nis equal to p(\u03bc = 0) = 11.71% and is observed in direction n perpendicular to surface normal N (see\nChandrasekhar 1950).\nHere and what follow \u03bc = cos i is cosine of disk's inclination angle.\nFor estimations of linear polarization from magnetized disks we use the approximate analytical\nformulae (see Silan'ev 2002 and Silant'ev et al. 2009). The far located disks we observe as a point\nsources. Therefore, we use azimuthally averaged values of polarization. In this case the integral\npolarization is described by simple formulae:\np(\u03bc, B) =\n\np(\u03bc)\n[(1 + C)4 + 2(1 + C)2 (a2 + b2 ) + (a2 \u2212 b2 )2 ]1/4\n\ntan 2\u03c7 =\n\n;\n\n2(1 + C)a\n.\n(p(\u03bc)/p(\u03bc, B))2 + (1 + C)2 + b2 \u2212 a2\n\n(1)\n(2)\n\nHere p(\u03bc) is the degree of polarization for non-magnetized atmosphere (Chandrasekhar's value),\nB = Bk + B\u22a5 is magnetic\nfield inside the disk, the component Bk is directed parallel to the disk\nq\nnormal N, and B\u22a5 = B\u03c12 + B\u03c62 is magnetic field perpendicular to N. Dimensionless parameters a\nand b describe the Faraday depolarization of radiation:\n2\n\n2\n\nq\n\na = 0.8\u03bb Bk \u03bc \u2261 \u03b4k \u03bc, b = 0.8\u03bb B\u22a5 1 \u2212\n\n\u03bc2\n\nq\n\n\u2261 \u03b4\u22a5 1 \u2212 \u03bc2\n\n(3)\n\nIn all the paper we take the magnetic field in Gauss, the wavelengths - in micrometers (\u03bcm), and\nthe distances - in centimeters. Physically the dimensionless parameter \u03b4 = 0.8\u03bb2 B corresponds to\nFaraday rotation of polarization plane along the Thomson optical length \u03c4 = 2, if the magnetic field\ndirected along line of sight n. Positional angle \u03c7 = 0 corresponds to wave electric field oscillations\nin the direction perpendicular to the plane (nN), i.e. parallel to disk's plane.\nParameter C arises in turbulent magnetized plasma (see Silant'ev 2005) and characterizes new\neffect - an additional extinction of Stokes parameters Q and U due to incoherent Faraday rotation\nof the polarization plane at small scale turbulent curls.\nC \u2248 0.64\u03c4 \u03bb4 hB \u20322 ifB /3\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03c4 is mean Thomson optical depth of a turbulent curl , hB \u20322 i characterizes mean value of\nmagnetic field fluctuations , fB \u2248 1 - dimensionless parameter, integrally describing correlation of\nB \u2032 taking at two near places of an atmosphere.\nBelow we will use the case B\u22a5 = 0. In this case formulae (1) and (2) are most simple:\na\np(\u03bc)\n, tan 2\u03c7 =\n.\np(\u03bc, Bk ) = q\n2\n2\n1+C\n(1 + C) + a\n\n(5)\n\nIf we take that the minimum observed polarization is equal to 0.1%, then we can observe the linear\npolarization in plasma without turbulent magnetic field (C = 0) in optical range (\u03bb \u2248 0.55\u03bcm) at\n\u03bc < 0.7 and magnetic fields in the emitting region in the interval from zero up Bk \u03bc \u2248 400. This is\nrather wide range of magnetic field variations. Thus, for the object NGC4258 authors (see Silant'ev\n2009) estimated the magnetic field in the region of optical emission as Bk \u2248 160 Gauss.\n\n2\n\n\f2\n\nMagnetic field in accretion disk\n\nUsually one uses that near the black hole horizon the strong magnetic field BH arises, which spreads\ninto accretion disk by power law, \u223c r \u2212n . Remember, that the horizon radius RH is determined by\nthe formula:\nq\nMBH\nGMBH\n1\n= 2.95 \u00d7 105\nRH = rg (1 + 1 \u2212 a2\u2217 ), rg = 2\n2\n2\nc\nM\u2299\n\n!\n\n[cm]\n\n(6)\n\nwhere rg is the gravitational radius of the central mass MBH , dimensionless parameter a\u2217 determines\nthe spin of a black hole, G is gravitational constant, c - the light velocity. For Schwarzschild's black\nhole (a\u2217 = 0) the value RH = rg , and for the fast rotating Kerr's black hole with a\u2217 = 1 the value\nRH \u2248 rg /2.\nRegular power law decreasing of magnetic field is accepted from the radius rms of first from the\ncenter stable orbit. Analytical expression for rms has the form (see Zhang 2005, Murphy 2009):\n1\nrms \u2261 q(a\u2217 )rg = (3 + A2 \u2212 [(3 \u2212 A1 )(3 + A1 + 2A2 )]1/2 )rg ,\n2\nA1 = 1 + (1 \u2212 a2\u2217 )1/3 [(1 + a\u2217 )1/3 + (1 \u2212 a\u2217 )1/3 ], A2 = (3a2\u2217 + A21 )1/2 .\n\n(7)\n\nAccording to this formula, Schwarzschild's hole has rms = 3rg , and fast rotating Kerr's hole (a\u2217 \u2248 1)\nhas rms = rg /2, therewith the decreasing of rms near a\u2217 \u2248 1 is very fast: rms \u2248 rg (1 + (4\u03b4)1/3 )/2 at\na\u2217 \u2248 (1 \u2212 \u03b4) (\u03b4 \u226a 1) (see Chandrasekhar 1983). The values q(a\u2217 ) for a number of a\u2217 are presented\nin Table 1.\nUsually in accretion disks models one considers that at horizon RH the magnetic field BH is\nperpendicular to the spherical surface, but further it enters to accretion disk perpendicular to disk's\nsurface, i.e. in disk exists the component Bk (r) (see Wang 2002, 2003; Zhang 2005).\nThe values Bk (rms ) \u2261 kBH are slightly different for holes with different rotation velocity. Thus,\nfor a\u2217 = 1 the factor k = 0.5, and for a\u2217 = 0 k = 1/3 takes place (see Wang 2002). So, we can take\nrms n\nrg n\nBk (r) = Bk (rms )\n\u2261 kq n (a\u2217 )BH\n(8)\nr\nr\nFor power index one usually accepts 1 \u2264 n < 3 (see Pariev 2003).\nThe value BH , according to Li 2002, Wang 2002, and Ma 2007, is presented by the expression:\n\u0012\n\nBH =\n\n\u2248\n\n\u0013\n\n\u221a\n2km c\u1e40\n1.66 km\nq\n\u2248\nRH\n1 + 1 \u2212 a2\u2217\n\nq\n\nq\n\nkm\n\nMBH\nM\u2299\n\n!\u22121/2 \u0012\n\nLbol\n\u03b5Ledd\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0012\n\nMBH\nM\u2299\n\n\u00131/2\n\n!\u22121\n\n\u1e40 1/2 \u2248\n\n108.8\n1+\n\nq\n\n1 \u2212 a2\u2217\n\n(9)\n\nRemember that the Eddington luminosity Ledd = 1.3\u00d71038 (MBH /M\u2299 ), and the bolometric luminosity\nof a disk Lbol = \u03b5\u1e40 c2 . The parameter km = Pmagn /Pgas relates magnetic pressure with the gas\npressure into disk. At equilibrium usually one takes km \u2248 1. The parameter \u03b5, as it was mentioned,\ncharacterizes the effectiveness of transition of accretion energy (the accretion velocity \u1e40 ) to form of\nradiation.

The second formula relates directly Bk (R\n) with the accretion velocity.\nq\u03bb\nn\nEquations (12) and (13) contain the function fn (a\u2217 ) = q (a\u2217 )/(1 + 1 \u2212 a2\u2217 ), which basically determine the dependence of magnetic field (B \u223c fn ) in the radiation region from the black hole spin.\nThe values of this function are presented in Table 1.\nAs it was spoken, the factor k depends also on the spin a\u2217 , but this dependence is weak: k = 1/3\nfor a\u2217 = 0 and k = 1/2 for a\u2217 = 1. This dependence does not break the monotonic increase\nof Bk (R\u03bb ) with the decrease the spin. For this reason, further we shall neglect this weak effect.\nThus, the Faraday depolarization, which is proportional to Bk (R\u03bb ), increases with the spin decrease.\nTherefore, the observed degree of polarization pobs will decrease.\nAs it is seen from the derivation of formulae (12) and (13), the effect of polarization decreasing\nfor slow rotating black holes as compared with the fast rotating ones, mainly is determined by the\nfact, that in the first case the orbit rms is located far from the disk center than for the second case.\n4\n\n\fThis effect became more strong with grow of index n (for n = 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3 the ratio fn (0)/fn (1)\nacquires, the values 1.22, 3, 7.34, 18, 108, respectively).\nIf one considers the objects with equal masses MBH and luminosities Lbol , then it is necessary to\ntake into account that the parameter \u03b5 also depends on the spin a\u2217 . In this case the value of magnetic\nfield Bk (R\u03bb ) (and also the polarization) is determined by \u03a6n (a\u2217 ) = fn (a\u2217 )\u03b5n/3\u22121/2 (a\u2217 ) (Bk (R\u03bb ) \u223c \u03a6n ).\nThe values \u03a6(a\u2217 ) for a\u2217 = 0 and 1 are given in Table 2.\nFor most probable values of index n \u2248 1.5 \u2212 2, magnetic field in the emission region for\nSchwarzschild black hole is approximately to ten times higher than for fast rotating Kerr hole.\nClearly, in the first case the Faraday depolarization is considerably higher than in second case.\nThis means that the observed degree of polarization from active galactic nucleus (AGN) with the\nKerr black hole will be higher than that for Schwarzschild's hole, if we compare the systems with\napproximately equal masses and luminosities.\nIt is of interest to see what changes if to suppose that potential law (8) of magnetic field decreasing\ntakes place directly from the black hole horizon, i.e. one exists the relation:\nq\nrg n\nRH n\nBk (r) = BH\n= 2\u2212n (1 + 1 \u2212 a2\u2217 )n BH\n.\n(14)\nr\nr\nEvidently, in this case we have to take k =\nq 1 and q = 1. The magnetic field dependence from a\u2217\nBk (R\u03bb ) exists due to factor \u03a8n (a\u2217 ) = (1 + 1 \u2212 a2\u2217 )(n\u22121) (this is analog to fn (a\u2217 )).\nIn this case at n = 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3 the ratio \u03a8n (0)/\u03a8n (1) acquires the values 0.71, 1, 1.41, 2, 4.\nThese values are considerably lower than those for fn (0)/fn (1). For ratio \u03a8n (a\u2217 )\u03b5n/3\u22121/2 (the analog\n\u03a6n (a\u2217 )) at a\u2217 = 0 to the value at a\u2217 = 1 we obtain \u2248 1.4 for all values of n. This is also is much\nhigher than the corresponding values \u03a6n (0)/\u03a6n (1). Thus, the strong difference between polarizations\nin Schwarzschild and Kerr cases really is due to large difference between the radiuses of first stable\norbits in these cases.\nThe results of Table 1 show that there exists the dependence of polarization degree grow with the\ngrow of black hole spin. It seems for ensemble of AGNs with approximately close values of masses\nand luminosities we may to consider the spin a\u2217 \u2248 1 in systems with most high polarization, but\nwith pmax < 11.7%. For sufficiently large ensembles one has compare the observing polarization\nwith the \u03bc-averaged values of formula (5). Such comparison might give the estimates for \u03a6n (a\u2217 ) =\nfn (a\u2217 )\u03b5n/3\u22121/2 (a\u2217 ) for intermediate between a\u2217 = 0 and a\u2217 = 1 values of spin, i.e. give the estimates\nfor parameter \u03b5(a\u2217 ), and also for parameter n. It better for this to use the values of polarization in\ndifferent wavelengths. This difficult problem is not considered in our paper.\n\u0012\n\n4\n\n\u0012\n\n\u0013\n\n\u0013\n\nThe spin dependence of polarization from the region of\nbroad lines\n\nIn this case the characteristic distance RBLR of region emitting broad lines is determined by the\nexpression (see Shen 2009):\nRBLR = 2.1 \u00d7 10\n\n13\n\nMBH\nM\u2299\n\n!1/2 \u0012\n\nLbol\nLedd\n\n\u00131/2\n\n\u221a q\n= 5.525 \u00d7 10 \u03b5 \u1e40 .\n4\n\n(15)\n\nInstead of formula (11) we obtain\nrg\nRBLR\n\n= 10\n\n\u22127.85\n\nMBH\nM\u2299\n\n!1/2 \u0012\n\nLbol\nLedd\n5\n\n\u0013\u22121/2\n\nMBH\n= 5.34\nM\u2299\n\n!\n\n1\n\u221a \u221a .\n\u03b5 \u1e40\n\n(16)\n\n\fTable 2: Values of \u03a6n (a\u2217 ) and\nn\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n\u03a6n (0)\n2.25 2.42 2.60\n\u03a6\u0304n (0)\n3.64 6.28 10.9\n\u03a6n (1)\n0.94 0.58 0.35\n\u03a6\u0304n (1)\n1.09 0.77 0.55\n\u03a6n (0)/\u03a6n (1) 2.38 4.18 7.34\nfn (0)/fn (1) 1.22\n3\n7.34\n\u03a6\u0304n (0)/\u03a6\u0304n (1) 3.34 8.16 20\n\n\u03a6\u0304n (a\u2217 ).\n2\n3\n2.79 3.23\n18.8 56.4\n0.22 0.08\n0.38 0.19\n12.9 39.8\n18\n108\n50\n297\n\nSubstituting this expression into general formula (8), we obtain the following expression for\nBk (RBLR ):\n!n/2\u22121/2 \u0012\n\u221a\n\u0013\nkq n km\nLbol \u2212n/2+1/2 1\n8.8\u22127.85n MBH\nq\n\u221a =\nBk (RBLR ) =\n10\nM\u2299\nLedd\n\u03b5\n1 + 1 \u2212 a2\u2217\n!n\u22121\n\u221a\n(\u1e40)1/2\u2212n/2\nk km\nn MBH\n0.22+0.73n\nq\n\u221a\nq\n= 10\n.\nM\u2299\n( \u03b5)n\n1 + 1 \u2212 a2\u2217\n\n(17)\n\nSo, in the case of known luminosity Lbol and mass MBH\nBk (RBLR ) \u223c\n\nkq n \u03b5\u22121/2\n1+\n\nq\n\n1\u2212\n\na2\u2217\n\n= \u03a6\u0304n (a\u2217 ) = fn (a\u2217 )\u03b5\u22121/2 ,\n\n\u03b5\u22121/2 = 4.188 f or a\u2217 = 0, \u03b5\u22121/2 = 1.543 f or a\u2217 = 1.\n\n(18)\n\nRemember that for emission region in continuum the value \u03b5\u22121/2 is replaced by \u03b5n/3\u22121/2 .

It is seen that magnetic field in broad\nline emission region is also considerably lower for Kerr holes than that for Schwarzschild hole. We\nstress once more, that this takes place mainly due to that radius rms for Kerr black holes is located\nmore far from the emission region, and consequently the magnetic field is lower than in the case of\nnon-rotating Schwarzschild holes with its rms = 3rg .\n\n5\n\nConclusion\n\nUsing the model that the linear polarization of radiation from AGN is due to multiple scattering\nin magnetized accretion disks, we demonstrate that the polarization strongly depends on the spin\nof central black hole. For fast rotating Kerr-type black holes the linear polarization is considerably\nhigher than that for non-rotating Schwarzschild's holes. This is mainly occur due to fact that the\nradius of first stable orbit for Kerr holes is more far from the emission region R\u03bb than that for\nSchwarzschild holes with This result is based on the supposition ( seems very obvious) that the\npower law of magnetic field decrease takes place from the first stable orbit rms , which is greater\n(rms = 3rg ) for Schwarzschild hole. The far located the emission region from the first stable orbit the\nless is magnetic field in this region, and less the depolarization due to Faraday rotation effect. It is\nknown that bolometric luminosity of accretion disk near fast rotating Kerr black hole is considerably\nhigher than that for non-rotating hole with the same mass. It means that bright AGNs have to\ndemonstrate higher polarization of optical radiation than weak AGNs.\n6\n\n\fAcknowledgements\nThis research was supported by the program of Prezidium of RAS \"Origin and Evolution of Stars\nand Galaxies\", the program of the Department of Physical Sciences of RAS \"Extended Objects\nin the Universe\", by the Federal Target Program \"Scientific and scientific-pedagogical personnel of\ninnovative Russia\" 2009-2013 (GK 02.740.11.0246) and by the grant from President of the Russian\nFederation \"The Basic Scientific Schools\" (NSh-3645.2010.2).\n\nReferences\n[1] Blandford R.D., in: Active Galactic Nuclei, Lecture Notes 1990, Saas-Fee Advanced Course 20.\nEds.
