However,\nwe can reasonably assume that the trend of the viscosity-crystal content relationship obtained\nfrom data by van der Molen and Paterson [1979] at high solid fractions for partially-melted\ngranite is generally valid, and this it can be roughly described by a power law relationship. In\nfact, there is no reason to assume that effective relative viscosity of melted rocks tends towards\na plateau region as \u03c6 \u2192 1 as predicted by (1). From a quantitative point of view it is no\nsimple to determine correctly the controlling parameters, such as the critical fraction at which a\nrheological transition occurs or the maximum value that effective relative viscosity can reach as\n\u03c6 \u2192 1. Moreover there are several indications that these values strongly depend on the particle\nshape and particle size distribution. However, since magma viscosity controls magma transport,\nwhen modelling volcanic processes such as dome growth there is a strong need to estimate the\nviscosity dependence on crystal-content, even in the limit of very high crystal content where no\nexperimental observations are available [see e.g., Melnik and Sparks, 2005].\nHere we propose a simple modification of relationship (1) which improves all the main positive\nfeatures of it, yet at the same time, does not show a plateau region as \u03c6 \u2192 1, generally increases\nthe performance of the model, and exactly recovers the classical well established relationships\nvalid for small fractions. In order to obtain a satisfactory description of the effective relative\nviscosity on the entire range of \u03c6, from zero to near the unity, one more parameter is necessary,\n\nD R A F T\n\nAugust 21, 2018, 8:58am\n\nD R A F T\n\n\fX-3\n\nCOSTA: CRYSTAL-CONTENT VISCOSITY DEPENDENCE\n\ni.e. four parameters. The final four parameter model we adopt is the following:\n\u0012 \u0013\u03b4\n\u03c6\n1+\n\u03c6\u2217\n\u03b7(\u03c6) = \u0012\n\u0014\n\u0012 \u0013\u03b3 \u0015\u001b\u0013B\u03c6\u2217\n\u001a\u221a\n\u03c6\n\u03c0 \u03c6\n1+\n1 \u2212 \u03b1 erf\n2\u03b1 \u03c6\u2217\n\u03c6\u2217\n\n(2)\n\nwhere 0 < \u03b1 < 1, \u03c6\u2217 represents the critical transition fraction, \u03b3 > 1 is a measure of the rapidity\nof the rheological transition, and \u03b4 controls the increase of \u03b7 as \u03c6 \u2192 1. We can note that,\nfor large \u03b4, the second term at the numerator represents a negligible correction when \u03c6 < \u03c6\u2217 ,\nwhilst it becomes important when \u03c6 > \u03c6\u2217 . It easy to see that as \u03c6 < \u03c6\u2217 with decreasing \u03c6, the\nparameterisation (2) tends exactly to the Krieger and Dougherty [1959] relationship:\n\u0012\n\u0013\u2212B\u03c6\u2217\n\u03c6\n\u03b7 = 1\u2212\n\u03c6\u2217\n\n(3)\n\nand as \u03c6 \u2192 0, it recovers exactly the Einstein equation:\n\u03b7(\u03c6) \u2243 (1 + B\u03c6)\n\n(4)\n\nwhere B is the Einstein coefficient.\nAn example of the good performance of relationship (2) is shown in Figure 1. Here we plotted\nrelative viscosities deduced from the data of van der Molen and Paterson [1979] in the high crystal fraction regime, considering a crystal-free fluid viscosity of 104 Pa s as suggested by van der\nMolen and Paterson [1979]. These values are matched with and mean values of relative viscosities reported by Thomas [1965]. Although we must keep in mind all the intrinsic limitations of\nthese data [see Costa, 2005], we can observe that over the entire range of solid fraction, the model\nis able to reproduce all data with an excellent correlation (R2 = 0.999) and the curve behaviour\nsuggested by van der Molen and Paterson [1979]. Another example is shown in Figure 2 where,\nas in Costa [2005], the relative viscosities for Mg3 Al2 Si3 O12 and Li2 Si2 O5 measured by Lejeune\nand Richet [1995] and the fitted values are shown.
