The recent experimental realization of single-layer graphene sheets [3] has\nmade it possible to confirm some theoretical expectations, notably an unusual half-quantized quantum Hall\neffect [4, 5, 6]. In this Letter we show that quasiparticle\nchirality in weakly doped graphene layers also leads to\na peculiar suppression of the charge and spin susceptibilities. We predict that both quantities are suppressed\nby approximately 15% in current samples and that the\nsuppression will be larger if uniform samples with much\nlower densities can be realized. At a qualitative level,\nthese effects arise from an interaction energy preference\nfor MDF states with larger chiral polarization. Our conclusions are based on an evaluation of the exchange and\nRPA correlation energies of uniform spin-polarized MDF\nsystems with Coulomb interactions.\nRPA Theory of Graphene- We study the following MDF\nmodel Hamiltonian (with ~ = 1),\n\u0124 = v\n\nX\n\nk,\u03b1=\u2191,\u2193\n\n\u03c8\u0302k\u03b1\u2020 [\u03c4 3 \u2297(\u03c3*k)]\u03c8\u0302k\u03b1 +\n\n1\n2S\n\nX\n\n\u2032\n\n\u03b1\nvq n\u0302\u03b1\nq n\u0302\u2212q ,\n\nq 6= 0\n\u03b1, \u03b1\u2032 =\u2191, \u2193\n\n(1)\nwhere \u03c4 3 is a Pauli matrix that acts on the twodegenerate (K, K \u2032 ) valleys, k is a two-dimensional (2D)\nvector measured from the K and K \u2032 points, \u03c3 1 and \u03c3 2\nare Pauli matrices that act on graphene's pseudospin\n(A, B) degrees of freedom, S is the sample area, n\u0302\u03b1\nq =\nP \u2020\u03b1 \u03b1\nk \u03c8\u0302k\u2212q \u03c8\u0302k is the single-spin density operator, and vq =\n2\u03c0e2 /(\u01ebq) is the 2D Fourier transform of the Coulomb in-\n\nteraction potential e2 /(\u01ebr). In Eq.

In this work chirality refers to the eigenvalues\n(s, s\u2032 = \u00b1) of \u03c3 * k/|k|.\nThe model (1) requires an ultraviolet cutoff, as we discuss below. To evaluate the interaction energy we follow\na familiar strategy [7] by combining a coupling constant\nintegration expression for the interaction energy valid for\nuniform continuum models,\nEint =\n\nN\n2\n\nZ\n\n1\n\nd\u03bb\n\n0\n\nd2 q\nvq [S (\u03bb) (q) \u2212 1] ,\n(2\u03c0)2\n\nZ\n\n(2)\n\nwith a fluctuation-dissipation-theorem (FDT) expression [7] for the static structure factor,\nS (\u03bb) (q) = \u2212\n\n1\n\u03c0n\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n+\u221e\n\nd\u03a9 \u03c7(\u03bb)\n\u03c1\u03c1 (q, i\u03a9) ,\n\n(3)\n\nwhere n is the total electron density. This form of the\nFDT theorem takes advantage of the smooth behavior\nof the density-density response function along the imag(\u03bb)\ninary axis \u03c7\u03c1\u03c1 (q, i\u03a9). The RPA approximation for the\ninteraction energy then follows from the RPA approximation for \u03c7:\n\u03c7(\u03bb)\n\u03c1\u03c1 (q, i\u03a9) =\n\n\u03c7(0) (q, i\u03a9)\n1 \u2212 \u03bbvq \u03c7(0) (q, i\u03a9)\n\n(4)\n\nwhere \u03c7(0) (q, i\u03a9) is the non-interacting density-density\nresponse-function.

For a spin- and valley-unpolarized system\n\u03c7(0) = g\u03c7MDF [with kFc \u2192 kF = (4\u03c0n/g)1/2 ] where g = gs gv = 4 accounts for spin and valley degeneracy.\n2.1\n\n\u039b = 10\n\u039b = 102\n\u039b = 103\n\u039b = 104\n\u039b = 105\n\n1.75\n\n\u03b4\u03b5x/\u03b5F\n\n1.4\n1.05\n0.7\n0.35\n0\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nf\nFIG. 1: (Color online) Cut-off \u039b and coupling constant f\ndependence of the regularized exchange energy \u03b4\u03b5x in units of\nthe Fermi energy \u03b5F .

(2)-(5) is\nclearly divergent since \u03c7(0) increases with q at large q\nand falls only like \u03a9\u22121 at large \u03a9. The divergence is expected since the energy calculated in this way includes\nthe interaction energy of the model's infinite sea of negative energy particles. The MDF model can be expected\nto describe only changes in energy with density and spindensity at small \u03b5cF values. For definiteness we choose the\ntotal energy of undoped graphene (\u03b5cF = 0 in all channels)\nas our zero of energy. For pedagogical and numerical reasons it is also helpful to separate the contribution that\nis first order in e2 , the exchange energy, from the higher\norder contributions conventionally referred to in electron\ngas theory as the correlation energy. Using Eqs. (2)-(5)\nwe find that for unpolarized doped graphene the excess\nexchange energy per excess electron is\n\n\u03c7(0) (q, i\u03a9) \u2212 \u03c7(0) (q, i\u03a9)\n\n\u03b5F =0\n\n\u0015\n\n\u2261\u2212\n\n1\n2\u03c0n\n\nZ\n\nd2 q\nvq\n(2\u03c0)2\n\nZ\n\n+\u221e\n\nd\u03a9 \u03b4\u03c7(0) (q, i\u03a9) , (6)\n\n0\n\nand that the corresponding correlation energy is\n\u03b4\u03b5RPA\nc\n\n1\n=\n2\u03c0n\n\nZ\n\nd2 q\n(2\u03c0)2\n\nZ\n\n0\n\n+\u221e\n\n(\n\nd\u03a9 vq \u03b4\u03c7\n\n(0)\n\nWith this regularization the \u03a9 integrals are finite and the\nq integrals have logarithmic ultraviolet divergences. The\nremaining divergences are physical and follow from the\ninteraction between electrons near the Fermi energy and\nelectrons very far from the Fermi energy as we discuss\nat length later. The best we can do in using the MDF\nmodel to make predictions relevant to graphene sheets is\nto introduce an ultraviolet cutoff for the wavevector integrals, kc . kc should be assigned a value corresponding\nto the wavevector range over which the MDF model describes graphene. Based on this criterion [9] we estimate\nthat kc \u223c 1/a where a \u223c 0.246 nm is graphene's lattice\nconstant. The MDF is useful when kc is much larger than\nkF in all channels.\n\nWith this regularization the properties of graphene's\nMDF model depend on the dimensionless coupling con-\n\n\"\n\n1 \u2212 vq \u03c7(0) (q, i\u03a9)\n(q, i\u03a9) + ln\n1 \u2212 vq \u03c7(0) (q, i\u03a9) \u03b5 =0\nF\n\n#)\n\n.\n\n(7)\n\nstant (restoring ~)\nf \u2261g\n\ngc\ne2\n=\n\u03b1,\n\u01ebv~\n\u01ebv\n\n(8)\n\nand on \u039b = kc /kF . In Eq. (8), c \u223c 300v is the speed\nof light, \u03b1 \u2248 1/137 is the fine structure constant, and\n\u01eb depends on the dielectric environment of the graphene\nlayer. In typical circumstances f \u223c 2. \u039b is \u223c 10 in the\nmost heavily doped samples studied experimentally and\ncan in principle be arbitrarily large in lightly doped systems. We expect, however, that many of the electronic\nproperties of graphene layers will be dominated by disorder when the doping is extremely light.\nIn Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 we plot the exchange and correlation energies of the graphene MDF model as a function of\nf for a range of \u039b values. Note that both \u03b4\u03b5x and \u03b4\u03b5RPA\nc\nhave the same density dependence as \u03b5F \u221d n1/2 apart\nfrom the weak dependence on \u039b.

Note that including the RPA correlation\nenergy weakens the \u039b dependence so that the exchange\nenergy per electron scales more accurately with \u03b5F . It\nis possible to analytically extract the asymptotic behavior of the exchange and correlation energies at large \u039b\nby Laurent expanding the integrands of Eqs.

In a 2D electron systems the compressibility can be measured [10]\ncapacitively. We note that this type of measurement\nis less difficult when \u2202\u03bc/\u2202n is large as it is in weaklydoped graphene. In bulk electronic systems, the spinsusceptibility can usually be extracted successfully from\ntotal magnetic susceptibility measurements, but these\nare likely to be challenging in the case of single-layer\ngraphene. In 2D electron systems, however, information\nabout the spin-susceptibility can often [11] be extracted\nfrom weak-field magnetotransport experiments using a\ntilted magnetic field to distinguish spin and orbital response.\nOur results for the charge and spin-susceptibilities are\nsummarized in Fig. 3 and Fig. 4. For experiments performed over the density range over which properties appear to be intrinsic in current samples (\u039b between \u223c 10\nand \u223c 40), these results predict compressibility and susceptibility suppression (apparent quasiparticle velocity\nenhancement) by approximately 15%. Both the sign of\nthe interaction effect and the similarity of \u03ba and \u03c7 are\nin remarkable contrast with familiar electron gas behavior. In 3D and 2D non-relativistic electron gases both\nare [7, 12] strongly enhanced by interactions, with the\ncharge response diverging at intermediate coupling and\nthe spin response diverging at very strong coupling.\nDiscussion- The qualitative physics of ferromagnetism\nin metals is most transparent at the Hartree-Fock (HF)\nlevel. Similarly, the mechanism responsible for the un-\n\n\f4\ninverse compressibility would be enhanced by interactions as usual. The unusual behavior comes from the\nsecond term. For weakly doped graphene it is sufficient\n(0)\n(0)\nto expand \u03a3k,s to first order in k; \u03a3k=0,s is a physically irrelevant constant that is included in the chemical\npotential chosen as the zero of energy by our renormalization procedure. Expanding to first order in k gives\nthe leading interaction contribution to the velocity renormalization [13] of undoped graphene. In agreement with\nprevious work we find that for large \u039b and small f\n\n1\n\n\u03c7S/\u03c70\n\n0.9\n\n0.8\n\n0.7\n\n0.6\n\n0.5\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\nf\nFIG. 4: (Color online) Cut-off and coupling constant dependence of the spin susceptibility \u03c7S .

Correlations do however play an essential quantitative role.

It is\neasy to verify that this velocity renormalization is responsible for the leading ln(\u039b) terms in the exchange energy\nand in the exchange contributions to \u03ba\u22121 and \u03c7\u22121\nS . The\nconventional exchange energy contributes negatively to\n\u03ba\u22121 and \u03c7\u22121\nS and competes with the Dirac point velocity\nrenormalization.\nWhen correlations are included, the leading ln(\u039b) contributions to the interaction energy and to \u03ba\u22121 and \u03c7\u22121\nS ,\nstill follow from the (now altered) undoped system quasiparticle velocity renormalization. The enhanced quasiparticle velocity is tied to the Dirac point, i.e. to the\nswitch in chirality, and results in an interaction energy\nthat tends to be lower when the chemical potential is\nclose to the Dirac point in all channels. Fig. 3 and Fig. 4\nillustrate RPA theory predictions for experimentally observable consequences of the competition between this\ninterband effect and conventional intraband correlations.\nAcknowledgment - This work has been supported by the\nWelch Foundation, by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, by the Department\nof Energy under grant DE-FG03-02ER45958, and by the\nNational Science Foundation under grant DMR-0606489.\nM.P. acknowledges useful discussions with F.
