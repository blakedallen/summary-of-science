Recent research has\ncentered on the origin and symmetry of magnetoelectric\ncoupling. The crucial question is how the coupling between two spins depends on electric field:\nXh\nHme =\nJnm (E)\u015cn * \u015cm + Dnm (E) * \u015cn \u00d7 \u015cm\nnm\n\ni\n+ \u015cn * Anm (E) * \u015cm .\n\nFIG. 1: (Color online) Schematics of low temperature phases\nof RMnO3 : (a) Collinear sinusoidal phase and (b) Noncollinear cycloidal phase.\n\n(1)\n\nHere \u015cn and \u015cm are spins at lattice sites Rn and Rm ,\nand the electric field E can be either internal, i.e., from\nthe electric polarization in the material, or external, as\nis the case of incident light. The first two interactions\nin the right hand side of Eq. (1) are well understood.\nThe first one, exchange interaction J, is electric-field dependent because atomic positions are modulated by E\n(the phenomena of magnetostriction). The second one,\nthe Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction, is first order in spin-orbit coupling and is antisymmetric under\nspin interchange. The third and final interaction, the\nanomalous tensor A, is instead symmetric under spin interchange; it is known to originate from second order\nspin-orbit effects4 , but is usually believed to be weak or\nhard to probe. Nevertheless, its electric field dependence\nhas not been studied.\nMost interesting effects take place when one of the coupling coefficients depends linearly on electric field. For\ninstance, simple models based on electronic5 or lattice\nmediated polarization6 predict that the DM vector is\nelectric-field dependent according to Dnm \u221d E \u00d7 (Rn \u2212\nRm ); this gives rise to the phenomena of magnetically\ninduced ferroelectricity observed in a large class of materials, the cycloidal multiferroics5\u20138 .\nIn addition, the linear magnetoelectric effect makes\nmagnetic excitations electrically dipole active. This gives\n\nrise to the electromagnon, the quasiparticle of the multiferroic state9\u201318 . The observation of electromagnons in\noptical experiments provide invaluable clues on the symmetry and magnitude of the magnetoelectric coupling\npresent in Eq. (1). Moreover, the ability to launch, detect, and control magnons electrically also holds promise\nfor novel applications in information processing19,20 .\nThe\nobservation\nof\nmagnetically-induced\nferroelectricity8 and electromagnons10 in the class\nof perovskite manganites RMnO3 has made this material the prototype for studies of strong magnetoelectric\neffects. Here R is a rare-earth ion such as Dy, Tb,\nGd or their mixture, e.g., Gdx Tb1\u2212x . In the RMnO3\nfamily, spins are typically ordered with a period incommensurate with the lattice8,14 . Below the first N\u00e9el\ntemperature (T = 39 K in DyMnO3 ), the ground state\nof the Mn spins forms the collinear sinusoidal density\nwave depicted in Fig. 1(a). At even lower temperature\n(19 K in DyMnO3 ), another phase transition takes place\nwhere the Mn spins order non-collinearly in the cycloid\nground state shown in Fig. 1(b).\nThe detection of electromagnons in the cycloidal phase\nof RMnO3 led to a surprising observation. Optical experiments showed that two quite strong electromagnons\nare observed in the cycloidal phase, provided the electric field of light was directed along the crystallographic\n\n\f2\ndirection \u00e213,15,21 . This remained true even when the\ncycloid plane was flipped, leading to the conclusion that\nthe DM interaction D could not explain the origin of the\nobserved strong electromagnon resonances (but in recent\nexperiments a weak electromagnon resonance consistent\nwith the DM model was observed22 ). This is a surprising\nconclusion in view of the fact that the DM interaction is\nknown to be responsible for ferroelectricity in these materials.\nOptical experiments have also produced a puzzling observation: The lower energy electromagnon,\nunlike the higher energy one, survives also in the\ncollinear sinusoidal phase. This is observed, e.g., in\nDyMnO3 21 , Gd0.7 Tb0.3 MnO3 23 , and Eu1\u2212x Yx MnO3 24 ,\nbut in TbMnO3 no electromagnons are discernible in the\nsinusoidal phase12 .\nCurrently, there exists a consensus that the high energy\nelectromagnon originates from magnetostriction, the first\nterm in Eq. (1)13,16,17 . However, no consensus exists on\nthe origin of the low energy electromagnon. Two quite\ndifferent models were proposed for its explanation: In\n[16], we showed that magnetostriction plus spin-orbit\ncoupling is able to explain the origin of both electromagnons even when the cycloid ground state is purely\nharmonic. In [17], Mochizuki et al. showed that pure\nmagnetostriction plus cycloid anharmonicity (without a\ntensor A) is able to explain the two electromagnons of\nthe cycloid phase, suggesting that anharmonicity plays\na vital role (similar results for BiFeO3 were proposed in\n[25]). But neither of the two above-mentioned models is\nable to explain the optical activity of the low energy electromagnon in the sinusoidal phase.\n\nII.\n\nMODEL FOR RMnO3\n\nexchange favors incommensurate spin ordering. Between\nthe first and second N\u00e9el temperatures the spins order in\na sinusoidal density wave,\nS0 (R, T ) = \u00b1S(T ) cos(Q * R + \u03c6)b\u0302,\n\n(3)\n\nwith S(T ) a temperature dependent amplitude [see Eq.\n(3.14) in Ref. 26 for its dependence on model parameters]. The magnitude of the sinusoidal wave vector Q\nis given by cos(Qb/2) = \u2212J0 /(2J2b ). The upper sign in\nEq. (3) corresponds to ab layer spins with the integer ccoordinate, while the lower sign applies to spins in the\nneighboring ab layers a distance c/2 above and below\nthem.\nOur phonon Hamiltonian is\nX\nX\n\u0001\n1\nHph = m\u2217\n\u1e8b2n + \u03c902 x2n \u2212 e\u2217\nxn * E,\n(4)\n2\nn\nn\nwhere \u03c90 is the (bare) phonon frequency, m\u2217 is the effective mass, xn is the relative displacement between anions\nand cations in the nth unit cell, e\u2217 is the Born charge,\nand E is the electric field of light.\nWe divide the linear magnetoelectric couplings in our\n(2)\n(1)\nmodel into two separate terms, Hme and Hme .

Our model\nHamiltonian consists of spin and phonon couplings, H =\n(2)\n(1)\nHS + Hph + Hme + Hme .

The interaction J0 < 0 is\nferromagnetic while J2b > 0 and Jc > 0 are both antiferromagnetic.\nAt sufficiently low temperatures, provided that the\nstability condition J2b > \u2212J0 /2 is satisfied, the competition between the nearest-neighbor ferromagnetic exchange, and the antiferromagnetic next-nearest-neighbor\n\na\na\nb\nb\n+gab (\u015c1,n\n\u2212 \u015c1,n+b\n)(\u015c2,n\n+ \u015c2,n+a\n) + (1 \u2194 2)]\n+(1 \u2192 3, 2 \u2192 4)},\n(6)\n\nwhere gab and gbc are coupling constants that can be\nobtained by microscopic calculation (e.g., using density\nfunctional theory). Like Eq. (5), this spin-symmetric interaction is also invariant under the P bnm space-group\noperations of RMnO3 , and is therefore consistent with\nlattice symmetry. Both interactions represent anomalous magnetoelectric coupling, with particular forms of\nthe anomalous tensor A [Eq. (1)]. A generalization of\nMoriya's theory4 to allow for magnetostriction effects\nshows that such interactions can originate from crosscoupling between spin-orbit and magnetostriction effects.\nHowever, a full microscopic theory is still needed to confirm this expectation.\nIII.\n\nELECTROMAGNON SPECTRA\n\nWe adopt the molecular field approximation and expand the Hamiltonian H by keeping only terms quadratic\n\n\f3\n\n\u03c9\n\nin the fluctuation operators, e.g., \u03b4 \u015cc2 , \u03b4 \u015ca \u03b4Pa , \u03b4Pa2 ,\netc. We parametrize the spin excitations \u03b4 \u015c = \u015c \u2212 S0\nby \u03b4 \u015ci,n = \u015dai,n \u00e2 \u00b1 \u015dci,n \u0109, and compute the equations\nof motion using the canonical commutation relations,\n[\u015dcj,n , \u015dak,m ] = i\u03b4jk \u03b4nm \u015ckb . In addition, we also adopted\nthe random phase approximation (RPA), i.e., we made\nthe substitution \u015ckb \u2192 h\u015ckb i = S0 (Rk , T ) * b\u0302 in the commutator above. Such an approximation is expected to\nhold when the fluctuation effects are not too large (i.e.,\nwe are sufficiently far from the N\u00e9el temperature).\nAfter some manipulation the coupled equations of motion for spins and polarization is given by,\n\u0001\n\u0001\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\u03c9 2 \u2212 \u03a92C,q s\u03b1\n= \u03a9C,q \u0393q , (7a)\n|\n1q + s2q + s3q + s4q\n\u0001 \u03b1\n\u0001\n0\n(2\u03c0/b \u2013 2Q)\n2\u03c0/b\n2\n2\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\nq\n\u03c9 \u2212 \u03a9C,q+k0 s1q \u2212 s2q + s3q \u2212 s4q = \u03a9C,q+k0 \u0393q+k0 ,\n(7b) FIG. 2: (Color online) Typical dispersion curves for magnon\n\u0001 \u03b1\n\u0001\n2\n2\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\u03c9 \u2212 \u03a9EC,q s1q + s2q \u2212 s3q \u2212 s4q = 0,\n(7c) wavevector q along b\u0302 in the sinusoidal phase: cyclon (black\n\u0001 \u03b1\n\u0001\n2\n2\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\u03b1\n\u03c9 \u2212 \u03a9EC,q+k0 s1q \u2212 s2q \u2212 s3q + s4q = 0,\n(7d) solid) and extra-cyclon (red dashed).

The pole at the magnon frequency shows that the\n\nonly the low-energy electromagnon (filled circle) is activated,\n(2)\n(1)\nthrough Hme [Eq. (6)]. In the cycloidal state, Hme [Eq. (5)]\nactivates also the zone-edge electromagnon (hollow square).\n\ncyclon at q = k0 \u2212 2Q is actually an electromagnon, with\nspectral weight given by\nSem =\n\n4\u03c0\u03c70 \u03c902 \u22062\n.\n\u03c902 \u2212 \u03a92C,k0 \u22122Q\n\n(11)\n\nHere \u03c70 = e\u22172 /(m\u2217 v0 \u03c902 ) is the zero-frequency susceptibility, with v0 the unit cell volume.

ADDITIONAL CONSEQUENCE OF\nANOMALOUS MAGNETOELECTRIC\nINTERACTION: INCOMMENSURATE\nOSCILLATORY POLARIZATION\n\nIn addition to the sinusoidal electromagnon, the couplings described by Eqs.

The first column refers to\nmeasurements of electromagnon spectral weight using far-IR\noptical experiments, and the second column refers to the measurement of magnetically induced lattice distortions using Xray spectroscopy. Each experiment has different magnetoelectric signatures, depending on whether the ground state\nis cycloidal or sinusoidal. All parameters can be measured\nindividually, and in addition, parameters gb and gc can be\ncross-checked.\n\nwe get\n\u0012 \u0013\nQb\ne\u2217 xn\n{(gb \u2212 gc ) sin [Qb(2n + 1)]\n= 4\u03c70 S 2 sin\nv0\n2\n\u2212gbc cos [Qb(2n + 1)] + gbc } \u00e2.\n(13)\nNote how gbc generates a combination of static and oscillatory polarization along the \u00e2 direction.\nWhen the system goes into the sinusoidal phase, this\npolarization changes discontinously to\n\u0012 \u0013\ne\u2217 x n\nQb\n= 4\u03c70 S(T )2 sin\ngb sin [(2n + 1)Qb]\u00e2.

Indeed, Kimura et al. detected an oxygen\noscillation with wavevector 2Q in both the cycloidal and\nsinusoidal phases [see blue dots in Fig. 1(c) of [8]]. Just\nlike our prediction, the X-ray intensity in [8] showed an\napparent discontinuity in oxygen displacements in the\ntransition from cycloidal to sinusoidal phase.\nTable I shows how a combination of optical and\nX-ray scattering experiments are capable of measuring the magnetoelectric coupling constants individually,\nand even cross-check some of them. For instance, for\nDyMnO3 , we obtain from the measured electromagnon\nspectral weights21 and X-ray diffraction intensities27\nin the sinusoidal and cycloidal phases the values of\ngb \u223c 170 erg/(cm esu), gc \u223c \u221240 erg/(cm esu), gab \u223c\n\n\u2217\n\u2020\n1\n\n2\n3\n\n4\n\nmarkku.stenberg@iki.fi\nrdesousa@uvic.ca\nW.

First, we note that the\npresence of DM interaction in principle also predicts an\nelectromagnon in the collinear sinusoidal state28,29 . However, this scenario is ruled out by the experiments where\nthe electromagnon is activated with E along \u00e2 only. In\naddition to the DM interaction, there are no other linear magnetoelectric couplings anti-symmetric under the\nexchange of spins that would be allowed by lattice symmetry.\nThe anharmonic cycloid model of Mochizuki et al.17\nwould give rise to no electromagnon activity in the sinusoidal phase. One possibility for the activation of sinusoidal electromagnons in this scenario would be to include\nadditional single-ion anisotropy so that the spins in the\nground state are tilted off the b\u0302 axis30 . However, in this\ncase both high and low energy electromagnons get activated. We found no scenario where deformation of the\nsinusoidal ground state activates the low-energy electromagnon without activating the high-energy one.\nConcerning other possible symmetry-allowed magnetoelectric interactions, we note that the other couplings\nquadratic in spin do not couple electric field linearly to\nmagnons. More specifically, terms of the form xan Sia Sja ,\nxan Sic Sjc , and xan Sia Sjc lead to contributions that are third\norder in fluctuation operators, and the term xan Sib Sjb\ndoes not couple polarization to magnons. Hence in the\ncollinear sinusoidal state only the couplings linear in S b\nconsidered in the present work [Eq. (6)] can be responsible for the electromagnons in collinear sinusoidal state.\nIn conclusion, we showed that anomalous magnetoelectric coupling gives a natural explanation for the origin\nof electromagnons in both the cycloidal and sinusoidal\nphases of RMnO3 . It remains an open question to study,\ne.g., through ab-initio methods, the microscopic mechanism of anomalous magnetoelectric coupling.\nWe acknowledge support from NSERC discovery.\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n8\n\n9\n\nH.
