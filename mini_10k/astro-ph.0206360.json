We present the mass function (MF) of the Arches cluster\nobtained from ground-based adaptive optics data in comparison with results derived from HST/NICMOS data.

Both datasets reveal a strong radial variation in the MF, with\na flat slope in the cluster center, which increases with increasing radius.\n\n1.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Arches cluster is one of the most massive young star clusters found in the\n4\nMilky Way. The total stellar mass is estimated to be >\n\u223c 10 M\u2299 , with a central\n5\n\u22123\nstellar density of 3 * 10 M\u2299 pc (Figer et al. 1999). Located at a projected\ndistance of only 25 pc from the Galactic Center (GC), it evolves under extreme\nphysical conditions. As the formation of massive stars (M > 30M\u2299 ) is proposed\nto be strongly dependent on high stellar and gas densities (Behrend & Maeder\n2001, Bonnell et al. 1998), star clusters close to the GC are important test beds\nfor star formation (SF) scenarios in dense regions. Displaying the highest stellar\ndensity found in a massive young cluster (YC) in the Milky Way, the Arches\ncluster is a unique object for the comparison with massive SF models. Due to\nthe proximity to the GC, strong tidal forces act towards the disruption of the\ncluster entity, causing the timescale for dynamical evolution to be short, which\nmay lead to the dissolution of the cluster within 10 \u2212 20 Myr (Kim et al. 1999,\nPortegies Zwart et al. 2002). With an age of only 2.5 \u00b1 0.5 Myr (Figer et al.\n2002, in prep.), the stellar population of the Arches cluster should be mostly\nunaffected by stellar evolution, but the spatial appearance of the cluster should\nreflect the fast dynamical evolution.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nA. Stolte et al.\n\nFigure 1.\nArches colour-magnitude diagrams obtained with the\nGemini North AO system Hokupa'a and HST/NICMOS. Stars in the\ncluster center are marked as circles. The 2 Myr isochrone (Lejeune\n& Schaerer 2001) used to transform magnitudes into stellar masses is\nshown as a solid line.\n2.\n\nObservations\n\nWe analyse high-resolution adaptive optics (AO) H and Ks -band observations of\nthe Arches cluster center obtained during the Gemini North science verification1\n(SV) with the University of Hawai'i AO system Hokupa'a (Graves et al. 2000).\nThese data are compared to HST/NICMOS observations of the same field obtained by Figer et al. (1999). In uncrowded regions, the spatial resolution and\nlimiting magnitudes in both datasets are comparable given a 3 to 4 times longer\nintegration time in H and Ks , respectively, for the Gemini observations. In\ncrowded regions, the AO data are limited by uncompensated seeing haloes from\nbright stars caused by the low Strehl ratio of only a few percent in the Gemini\nSV data. These haloes locally decrease the detection efficiency of faint sources.\nEvidence for this is seen at the faint end of the colour-magnitude diagrams and\nin the MF of the dense cluster center.\n3.\n\nColour-Magnitude Diagrams\n\nThe H \u2212 K, K colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) are shown in Fig. 1. The\ndominant feature in the CMDs is the Arches main sequence (MS). Due to the\nlow Strehl ratio in the Gemini data, the upper part of the MS, corresponding\nto the bright population in the cluster center, appears less confined than in\n1\n\nThe Gemini North science verification data are publicly available at http://www.gemini.edu\n\n\fMass Function of the Arches Cluster\n\n3\n\nFigure 2.\nColour gradient observed over the Gemini field of view of\n\u2032\u2032\n20 (1024 pixels). The change in H \u2212 Ks is shown as a function of\ndistance from the cluster center.\nthe NICMOS CMD. The fainter stars, not detected in the cluster center due\nto crowding, show a large scatter towards redder colours, which is caused by a\nstrong colour gradient observed over the Arches field.\n\n4.\n4.1.\n\nResults\nColour Gradient\n\nThe colour trend is apparent in both datasets, with increasingly red stellar\ncolours observed at increasing radii (Fig. 2). The change in H \u2212 Ks corresponds to an increase in visual extinction of \u2206AV \u223c 15 mag (\u2206AV = \u2206(AH \u2212\nAK )/0.0630, Rieke & Lebofsky (1985)). The well confined main sequence at the\nbright end of the CMD shows that the innermost cluster center (\u223c 5\u2032\u2032 , 0.2 pc\nat 8 kpc distance) is unaffected by this colour trend. This suggests that the remaining dust and gas has been expelled from the cluster center by winds and/or\nphotoevaporation from the massive stars.\n4.2.\n\nMass Function\n\nAfter correction for the extinction variation, a 2 Myr isochrone from the Geneva\nbasic set of stellar evolution models (Lejeune & Schaerer 2001) has been used\nto transform K-band magnitudes into stellar masses. The resulting MF (Fig.\n3) displays a slope of \u0393 = \u22120.8 \u00b1 0.2 in the mass range 10 < M < 65M\u2299 in\nthe Gemini as well as the HST dataset. This slope is flatter than the Salpeter\nslope of \u0393 = \u22121.35, often assumed to be universal in young star forming regions.\nWhen neglecting the colour trend, we derive a MF slope as flat as \u0393 \u223c \u22120.5\u00b10.2.\nThis clearly shows that the changes in extinction in SF regions are not negligible\nwhen deriving mass functions. The flat MF observed in Arches indicates an overdensity of high-mass stars as compared to other SF regions, thereby supporting\nmodels predicting enhanced high-mass SF in dense regions.\n\n\f4\n\nA. Stolte et al.\n\nFigure 3.\nMass function of the Arches cluster. \u0393 denotes the slope of\na linear, weighted least-squares fit to the bright end of the MF, Salpeter\nwould be \u0393 = \u22121.35.\nWe have analysed the stellar population at different radii from the cluster center to derive the radial variation in the MF (Fig. 4). The MF slope\nappears very flat in the cluster center, where stellar and gas densities are highest, and increases with increasing radius. While mainly massive stars are found\nin the central part of Arches, an increasing number of faint, low-mass stars is\nfound in the cluster outskirts, indicating mass segregation. To exclude that\nthe derived variation is due to crowding, incompleteness simulations have been\nperformed in each radial bin, shown as dotted lines in Figs. 3 and 4. Although incompleteness begins to affect the MF earlier in the cluster center\n(R < 5\u2032\u2032 ), the corrected MF remains very flat for M > 10M\u2299 . From the distribution of stellar masses, we can obtain a rough estimate of the relaxation\n8\n\n\u0010\n\n\u00111/2 \u0010\n\n\u0011\u0010\n\n\u00113/2\n\n1 M\u2299\nyr\nrh m\nM\ntimescale, trh = 6.63*10\n, where M is the mass\nm\u2217\n1 pc\nln(0.4N )\n105 M\u2299\nwithin the half-mass radius rhm , m\u2217 the characteristic mass, and N the number of stars (Binney & Tremain 1987). We obtain rhm = 0.4 pc and observe\nM (rhm ) = 6300 M\u2299 as a lower limit to the total mass. The median mass within\nrhm is measured to be 7.3 M\u2299 . Assuming a total mass of at least 104 M\u2299 leads\nto trh = 1.2 Myr. A characteristic mass of 1 M\u2299 , more typical for SF regions,\nyields trh = 6.2 Myr. With trh being on the same order of magnitude as the\nage of Arches, it is impossible to discrimate between primordial and dynamical\nmass segregation.\n\n5.\n\nSummary\n\nThe radial variation in the MF of the Arches cluster as well as the flat integrated\nmass function support massive cluster and star formation models, suggesting\nhigh-mass stars to form in dense cluster environments. Although the radial\nvariation in the MF strongly suggests mass segregation in Arches to be present,\nthe short dynamical timescales, strongly influenced by the GC tidal field, prohibit discrimination between primordial and dynamical segregation effects.\n\n\fMass Function of the Arches Cluster\n\nFigure 4.\nin Fig. 3.\n\n5\n\nRadial variation of the Arches mass function.
