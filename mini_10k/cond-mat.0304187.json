INTRODUCTION\n\nThe advances in the comprehension of the physical properties of manganese perovskites\nhave been given in two main boosts. The first one started in 1950, when these materials\nwere first considered by Jonker and van Santen.1 In that period, that spanned over more\nthan a decade, the basic mechanisms governing their magnetic and transport properties were\ndefined, giving rise to the description of the double exchange interaction.2\u20134 The second one\ntook place last decade, after the discovery of colossal magnetoresistance (CMR)5,6 (although\na high MR had already been observed experimentally before, first by Searle and Wang7\nand later by Kusters et al.8 ). During this period, in which we are still immersed, the\nresearch activity reached a magnitude that made the topic a starring one in the community\nof Condensed Matter Physics, and the current opinion about the state-of-the-art underwent\nseveral changes. In the first few years after the description of CMR, explanations were tried\non the basis of double exchange,9 but it was demostrated soon that such effect alone could\nnot explain the magnitude of CMR.10 Later, certain evidences in favor of the existence of\nan inhomogeneous electronic state in these materials started to appear.11\u201319 This tendence\ncontinues nowadays after the conclusions of many groups that found -and are still findingthat the homogeneous description of the magnetic and electronic state of manganites is\nalmost ruled out.\nIn order to establish the basis for such behavior the idea of phase separation, i.e., the\ncoexistence of regions of localized and itinerant carriers within the same crystallographic\nstructure, has been proposed.20,21 In this framework, Dagotto, Hotta and Moreo22 proposed\nin a recent review the existence of a temperature window where coexisting metallic and\ninsulating clusters appear above the Curie temperature, TC , when this transition is firstorder and there is a source of disorder. This temperature window would extend up to\nT \u2217 > TC , where these clusters dissociate to form two-Mn Zener polarons (or small polarons).\nThe aim of the present work is to find experimental evidence of such temperature T \u2217 . For\nthis purpose, ultrasonic attenuation and phase velocity measurements were carried out in\n3\n\n\fLa2/3 Ca1/3 MnO3 and La2/3 Sr1/3 MnO3 . This technique is proved to be a very sensitive tool\nnot only for studying defects and microscopic processes in solids, but also for probing systems\nundergoing magnetic and structural phase transitions.23\n\nII. EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS\n\nSamples were prepared by solid state reaction of La2 O3 , CaO or SrCO3 , MnO2 and MnO\n(at least 99.995 % in purity), which were heated in air in two steps (1100\u25e6C 70 hours, 1200\u25e6 C\n27 hours) and pressed into disks. The temperature was slowly ramped at 5\u25e6 C/min, and\ncooled down to room temperature at 2\u25e6 C/min. Intermediate grindings were made. Pellets\nwere finally pressed at 7 Ton/cm2 and annealed at 1300\u25e6C for 100 hours, with an intermediate\ngrinding at 30 hours. The nominal oxygen content was almost stoichiometric as determined\nby iodometric analysis. X-ray powder patterns were collected at room temperature using\na Philips PW1710 diffractometer, working with CuK\u03b1 radiation. The lattice parameters,\nderived by Rietveld analysis, are in agreement with those reported in the literature.\nCylindrical pellets, with a diameter of 10.0 mm and heights 2.4 mm (LaCaMnO), and\n3.1 mm (LaSrMnO) were used to perform ultrasonic measurements. The two opposite faces\nof each sample were polished so that the difference between two points in each surface was\nnot more than 1 \u03bcm. The ultrasonic velocity and attenuation measurements were performed\non a Matec-6600 series by means of the conventional pulse-echo technique. Y-cut quartz\ntransducers of 5 MHz fundamental frequency were used for transverse ultrasonic excitation.\nThey were coupled to the sample surface with a grease for high temperature uses (leak point\n550 K). The sample was coupled at high temperature, and then cooled until 200 K and\nmaintained at this temperature for 15 minutes before measurementes were carried out. The\nultrasonic elapsed time for a pulse round trip (transit time) was obtained with the pulseecho-overlap technique at the initial temperature. Then, time variation with temperature\nwas automatically monitored with a sensitivity of 0.05 ns at 5 MHz. The experiment was\ntaken in a closed-cycle refrigerator (Janis) and the temperature of the sample was varied at\n4\n\n\fa rate of about 0.5 K/min.\n\nIII. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION\n\nIn Fig. 1(a) we show ultrasonic velocity vs. temperature data for La2/3 Ca1/3 MnO3\nand La2/3 Sr1/3 MnO3 , and attenuation vs. temperature data for La2/3 Ca1/3 MnO3 , obtained\nwith 5 MHz transversal waves between 220 and 400 K. For LaSrMnO it was impossible to\nmeasure the attenuation because its high value allowed to obtain only two echoes at room\ntemperature (at higher temperatures the second echo became negligible). The transit time\nwas measurable at room temperature, and then time variations were measured with our\nautomated improved Matec system. The influence of thermal expansion has not been taken\ninto account, because it is negligible: if (\u03b4l)/l=2 * 10\u22124 we have that for our sample, with\nl= 2.4 mm thick (4.8 mm microwave path) and a velocity of about 2500 m/s, \u03b4t (t=time)\nis 5 * 10\u22124 s and therefore, at TC , the associated variation of velocity is far smaller than the\none we measured.\nIn our original ultrasonic velocity data, an approximately linear increment with temperature was observed at temperatures above 350 K for both samples. At this temperature\nrange no mechanism related with magnetic phase transitions is expected, and this variation\nshould be attributed to another mechanism, as the produced by crystalline defects present\nin the material.24 The resonant mechanism associated to dislocation lines is well known\nfrom crystalline metals. As Moreno-Gobbi and Eiras25 , working on crystalline copper, have\nshown, it gives a term proportional to T for velocity and proportional to T2 for attenuation.\nThe coefficient of proportionality depends on L2 for velocity and L4 for attenuation, where L\nis the average free length of the segment of dislocation lines. In the present paper we assume\na background of this kind in order to take into account the variation of velocity at high temperatures. The velocity background was fitted to the high temperature region of velocity vs.\ntemperature curves, and then substracted from original data. These fits gave a term 0.37\nT for LaCaMnO and 0.46 T for LaSrMnO. The so-corrected velocity data are presented in\n5\n\n\fFig. 1(b). The differences between the numerical values of the coefficients of proportionality\nhave their origins in the different values of L expected for different materials.24\nThe ultrasonic velocity for La2/3 Ca1/3 MnO3 presents two clear anomalies: an abrupt\nhardening at about 250-260 K, and another lesser at about 350-360 K. The first one marks\nthe TC of this system26\u201330 (TC = 260 K). The behavior is similar to that found at MHz\nfrequencies by other authors,31,32 and at kHz frequencies by Cordero et al.33 The abrupt\ndecay of the curve at TC signals the first-order character of this transition,34 an interpretation\nthat is in agreement with results obtained from other techniques.26\u2013 30 The decay in velocity\nis accompanied by a peak in the attenuation curve at TC . This peak is asymmetric, in\nagreement with the results of Cordero et al.,33 who explain it invoking the presence of\ninhomogeneous phases below TC in a similar way to relaxor ferroelectrics.35,36\nThe second anomaly takes place above TC , showing a hardening process at T \u2217 \u2243 350-360\nK (Fig. 2). In Fig. 1 it is also observed a very large attenuation peak at 320 K accompanying\nthis velocity anomaly. This was not observed by Cordero et al. at kHz frequencies, but is\nclearly observed in our MHz measurements. The reason lies on the higher sensitivity of MHz\ntechniques to small inhomogeneities, as magnetic clusters, due to the shortest wavelength\n(approximately 0.5 mm at 5 MHz for transversal waves).\nIn Figs. 1 and 2 it is also observed that the only noticeable anomaly in the utrasonic\nvelocity curve of La2/3 Sr1/3 MnO3 is a hardening process beginning at about 370 K (in the\norder of that of LaCaMnO in the same temperature region), that is coincident with the\nsecond-order phase transition point of this compound, clearly observed by magnetization\nmeasurements (TC \u2243 370 K).29,37\u201341 In the explored temperatures, no more transitions\nwere detected. Based on this behavior we can perfectly associate the process of hardening\nobserved at 370 K to this second-order phase transition.\nOne of the open issues in the comprehension of the physics of ferromagnetic manganese\nperovskites at present is to determine the nature of the magnetic phase above TC . From\nour ultrasonic velocity data it seems that this phase is different in the two systems considered. First of all, whereas LaCaMnO displays a first-order transition at TC , LaSrMnO\n6\n\n\fpresents a second-order one. This difference, that has already been highlighted by magnetic\nmeasurements,29 and attributed by Mira et al.30 to a change in the crystal symmetry, from\northorhombic to rhombohedral, seems to have further implications. Magnetoresistance,\nthermal expansion, magnetovolume and magnetocaloric effects experience a considerable\nchange when moving from one compound to the other.30,42,43 Also, calorimetric data showed\nevidence for an anomaly at a similar T \u2217 in those manganites La1\u2212x (Ca,Sr)x MnO3 with a\nfirst-order transformation at TC ,30 in agreement with the ultrasonic data presented here that\nshow the existence of a transition point at T \u2217 > TC in LaCaMnO. It is worth mentioning\nthat our T \u2217 is similar to the point at which both the volume thermal expansion deviates\nfrom a Gruneisen fit and the inverse magnetic susceptibility deviates from a Curie-Weiss fit,\nafter results of de Teresa et al. in La2/3 Ca1/3 MnO3 (Ref.44 ). Supporting our results, we have\nto mention that neutron diffraction studies45 in the paramagnetic region of La2/3 Sr1/3 MnO3\nshow differences with respect to La2/3 Ca1/3 MnO3 . We want also to call the attention on\nthe similar values of the temperatures of the second-order transitions, T \u2217 \u2243 350-360 K for\nLa2/3 Ca1/3 MnO3 , and TC \u2243 370 K for La2/3 Sr1/3 MnO3 . In some sense, it leads to think that\nthe magnetic interaction between the Mn atoms is of the same strength in both compounds\nand only the occurrence of the first-order change in LaCaMnO is breaking the long-range\norder at a temperature below T \u2217 . After R\u00f6der, Zhang and Bishop,46 this might be due to\nlattice effects, that would decrease the TC associated to the DE coupling.\nThe anomaly at T \u2217 shows that the magnetic phase transition is not from ferromagnetism\nto a purely paramagnetic state, but some sort of magnetic structure is present. Such idea is in\naccordance with the theoretical results of Moreo et al.,19 who have proposed, after computer\nsimulations, that large coexisting metallic and insulating clusters of equal electronic density\nare generated in manganese oxides with first-order magnetic transitions. Kimura et al.47\nhave qualified these compounds as relaxor ferromagnets, with a relaxation from one phase\nto the other. The fluctuations between both phases have been seen by Transmission Electron\nMicroscopy by Podzorov et al..48 In such a case, after Kimura et al.47 the transition would\nbe diffuse, like the one observed by us at T \u2217 . Nowadays there is being growing experimental\n7\n\n\fwork that leads to assume the electronic phase-separated nature of such materials, and now\nit is well established that this phase separation is not due to chemical inhomogeneities or to\nthe existence of phases with a different chemical composition.49 Although this approach is\nquite recent in manganese perovskites, it had already been proposed by Se\u00f1ar\u0131\u0301s Rodr\u0131\u0301guez\nand Goodenough50 to explain the magnetic and electrical properties of Sr-doped cobalt\nperovskites, thinking of a percolative transition at TC .\nIn summary, we consider that our data confirm the existence, in La2/3 Ca1/3 MnO3 , of\nthe temperature window TC < T < T \u2217 proposed by Dagotto, Moreo and Hotta22 , where\nprobably the coexistence of a phase separated regime of metallic and insulating regions\ncould be taking place. Such window is not observed in La2/3 Sr1/3 MnO3 , a material with\na conventional second-order ferromagnetic to paramagnetic phase transition at its Curie\ntemperature.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\n\nThe DGI of the Ministry of Science of Technology of Spain is acknowledged for financial\nsupport under project FEDER MAT2001-3749.
