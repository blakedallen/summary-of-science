This behavior suggests an antiferromagneti\n\noupling between\n\nthe layers. In addition, the samples having thinner SRO layers (n <6) exhibit enhan ed saturation magnetization at 10 K. These observations are attributed to the possible modi\u001c ation in the\nstereo hemistry of the Ru and Mn ions in the interfa ial region.\nPACS numbers:\n\n1\n\n\fTransition metal oxides are used to design arti\u001c ial magneti stru tures with di\u001berent\nbilayer on\u001cgurations onsisting of ferromagneti (FM) - antiferromagneti (AFM), AFM AFM, and FM - FM thin \u001clms. On several ombinations of FM-AFM bilayers the magneti\nbehavior exhibit horizontal and verti al hysteresis loop shifts,\n\n1,2,3,4\n\nbilayer systems show unexpe ted ferromagneti behavior.\n\n5,6,7\n\nKe\n\nwhile some AFM-AFM\n8\n\net. al.\n\nhave observed ex-\n\nhange bias e\u001be ts in multilayers onsisting of FM-FM bilayers omposed of La0.67 Sr0.33 MnO3\nand SrRuO3 . While Uozu et.\n\n9\n\nal.\n\nhave observed an antiferromagneti ex hange oupling in\n\nthe FM trilayer onsisting of Sr0.7 Ca0.3 RuO3 (SCRO) and La0.6 Sr0.4 MnO3 . in order to understand the oupling between the Ru and Mn ions at the interfa es of the two FM media, we\nhave synthesized a series of superlatti es onsisting of FM-FM bilayers of La0.67 Sr0.33 MnO3\n(LSMO) and SrRuO3 (SRO), where the LSMO layer thi kness (dLSM O ) is \u001cxed (~20 u. .)\nand the SRO layer thi kness (dSRO ) is varied. We note that the temperature dependen e\nof magnetization of these superlatti es strongly varies with the SRO layer thi kness when\nthe dSRO is less than 6 unit ells. In addition, these superlatti es show a sudden drop\nin magnetization at a temperature where both LSMO and SRO layers are ferromagneti .\nThe reprodu ible zero-\u001celd- ooled (ZFC) magneti minor hysteresis loop shape in the \u001celdooled (FC) state of these superlatti es suggests the existen e of antiferromagneti ex hange\noupling but not the presen e of an interfa ial layer of antiferromagneti hara ter.\nThin \u001clms of LSMO and SRO and their superlatti es were grown on (001) oriented SrTiO3\n(STO) substrates at 720\u25e6 C in oxygen ambient of 300 mTorr using a multitarget pulsed laser\ndeposition te hnique. The deposition rates (typi ally ~0.26 \u00c5/pulse and ~0.31 \u00c5/pulse)\nof SRO and LSMO respe tively were alibrated individually for ea h laser pulse of energy\ndensity ~3 J/ m2 . The hamber was \u001clled with oxygen of 300 Torr after ompletion of\ndeposition and then the samples were ooled to room temperature at the rate of 15 \u25e6 C/min.\nThe superlatti e stru tures were synthesized by repeating 15 times the bilayer onsisting of\na 20- unit ells thi k LSMO layer and n- unit ells thi k SRO layer, with n taking integer\nvalues from 1 to 12. In all multilayer samples, the bottom and top layers are of LSMO.\nChara terization of the stru ture and epitaxial nature of the multilayer and single layer \u001clms\nwere performed using x-ray di\u001bra tion (XRD). For the magnetization (M) measurements, we\nhave used a super ondu ting quantum interferen e devi e based magnetometer (Quantum\nDesign MPMS-5). These measurements were arried out by ooling the sample to the desired\ntemperature in the presen e/absen e of a magneti \u001celds applied along the [100\u2104 and [001\u2104\n2\n\n\fdire tions of the STO substrate. The orientation of the magneti \u001celd during the \u001celd- ooled\nmeasurements remained the same.\nThe latti e parameter of ubi STO (3.905 \u00c5) is smaller than that of the pseudo ubi\nlatti e parameter of SRO (3.93 \u00c5) but larger than that of the LSMO (3.88 \u00c5). Thus, STO\nprovides in-plane tensile stress for the epitaxial growth of LSMO with a latti e mismat h of\n-0.64 %. Similarly, it is expe ted that the LSMO would provides in-plane ompressive stress\nfor the epitaxial growth of SRO with a latti e mismat h 1.28 %. However, the LSMO-SRO\nsuperlatti e stabilizes pseudo ubi phases of these perovskites. In the onventional \u0398-2\u0398\ns ans of the superlatti es, no peaks were observed other than the (00l) Bragg re\u001de tions of\nthe onstituents, the substrate and the satellites due to hemi al modulation present in the\nmultilayer. To evaluate the \u001clm thi kness of LSMO and SRO layers, we have arried out\nquantitative re\u001cnement of the \u0398-2\u0398 s an of the trilayer stru tures using DIFFaX program.\n\n10\n\nThe experimental \u0398-2\u0398 s ans and the simulated pro\u001cles of the two samples re orded around\nthe (001) re\u001de tion of STO are shown in Fig. 1. The simulated pro\u001cle using the alibrated\nthi kness is in good agreement with the position of the Kiessig fringes and their relative\nintensity ratio on\u001crming the quality of the layers.\nLSMO exhibits positive spin polarization and ferromagneti ordering with a relatively\nhigh Curie temperature (TC ~360 K), small magneti anisotropy and low oer ive \u001celd\n(HC ). While SRO shows negative spin polarization with a relatively small TC (~150 K),\n11\n\nstrong uniaxial rystalline anisotropy and relatively large HC . In the magneti multilayers\n12\n\ndis ussed here the thi kness of the LSMO layer is \u001cxed at 20 u. . A typi al \u001celd- ooled\ntemperature-dependen e magnetization M(T) for ~ 20 u. . thi k LSMO and SRO \u001clms is\nshown in the Fig. 2a and 2b, respe tively. These relatively thin \u001clms of LSMO and SRO\nshow a redu ed TC of ~ 330 K and ~ 145 K respe tively. The redu ed TC seen in both the\nases is due to \u001cnite size e\u001be t resulting from the strains.\n\n13\n\nFig. 3 displays the \u001celd- ooled (FC) magnetization of the superlatti es with n=2, 4, 5,\n6 and 7. These measurements were performed at 0.01 tesla \u001celd applied along the outof-plane dire tion of the STO. From this \u001cgure it appears that the alternative sta king of\nLSMO and SRO in a superlatti e hanges the M(T) signi\u001c antly ompared to the M(T) of\nthe onstituents (e.g. LSMO and SRO). Similar behavior of magnetization is obtained when\nthe magneti \u001celd is applied in the plane (not shown), but the magnetization is larger in\nthe ase of the out-of-plane magneti \u001celd. The onset of spontaneous magnetization in all\n3\n\n\fsuperlatti es o urs at T=340 K. The behavior of M(T) at T<340 K is signi\u001c antly di\u001berent\nfrom that of the pure LSMO. For example, the FC magnetization of the sample with n=2\nde reases gradually as the temperature is raised from 10 K to 33 K. This trend is followed by\nan in rease of magnetization till a maximum value is rea hed at 100 K. A further in rease\nin temperature leads to a monotoni drops in magnetization (see Fig. 3a). As the SRO\nlayer thi kness is in reased up to 4 u. ., the magnetization in reases slowly above 10 K,\nbe omes maximum at 60 K, and then above 60 K de reases slowly. Between 160 K and 200\nK, the magnetization shows a plateau. Two hara teristi temperatures an be identi\u001ced\nin Fig. 3 in addition to the TC (350 K) above whi h the sample be omes paramagneti .\nThe \u001crst one is the temperature (TC *) at whi h the SRO layer be omes ferromagneti sin e\nthe magnetization rises sharply below this temperature (150 K). The se ond one, is the\ntemperature (TN ) below whi h the magnetization de reases although both the omponents\nare in the ferromagneti state. To larify this point we have enlarge the M(T) urve in this\nregion and shown them in Fig.3, panel f, g, h, i, and j for superlatti e with n=2, 4, 5, 6 and\n7, respe tively.\nThe distin t usp in magnetization below the TC of SRO is an indi ation of an antiferromagneti behavior. Thus, we denote the temperature asso iated to this feature as the\nN\u00e9el temperatures (TN ). However, when the SRO layer thi kness is in reased beyond 7 u. .,\nthis usp-like feature below the Curie temperature of SRO is suppressed. The TC (LSMO),\nTC * and TN of the superlatti es extra ted from Fig. 2 are plotted as a fun tion of dSRO\nin Fig. 4. As dis ussed before, the TC of the superlatti es is nearly independent of dSRO ,\nand is lose to the TC of LSMO (~340K), while the TC * in reases with dSRO . However, this\nTC * is not distinguishable for the superlatti es with dSRO >8 u. . On the ontrary, for the\nsamples with n<5 u. ., the TN shows a distin t in rease with the SRO layer thi kness. The\npresen e of a distin t TC (SRO) at 150 K in the M(T) data of the superlatti e with n > 4\nindi ates the formation of a stoi hiometri SRO layer. This observation suggests that in this\nmagneti system the interfa e roughness aused by the magneti and stru tural disorder is\nsmall (~2 u. .). The reprodu ible ZFC in-plane and out-of-plane minor hysteresis loops of\nthese samples in their orresponding FC state indi ate the existen e of an antiferromagneti ex hange oupling, but do not show the presen e of an interfa ial antiferromagneti\nlayer. The drop in magnetization, at a temperature whi h we have marked TN , ould be\n8\n\ndue to this disordered interfa e. A similar AFM ex hange oupling has been observed in\n4\n\n\fLSMO/SCRO/LSMO trilayers by Uozu et. al. , and in LSMO/SRO bilayers by Ke and\n9\n\noworkers . While the former group has attributed the AF oupling to superex hange in8\n\ntera tion, Ke et. al. attribute it to interfa ial harge transfer. However, the AFM ex hange\noupling with the SRO layer thi kness as seen in the present ase suggests the possibility\nof other physi al pro esses. Some well established sour es a\u001be ting the magneti\n\noupling\n\nin superlatti es are the substrate-indu ed strains, interfa ial stress and interlayer ex hange\noupling.\n\n13,14\n\nThe larger value of TC * ompare to the transition temperature of SRO ould\n\nalso be due to the high paramagneti sus eptibility of SRO above the TC (SRO) and/or\n15\n\nthe re onstru tion of the spin state of Ru and Mn ions at/ lose to the interfa es. The value\nof the TN in reases and saturates to a temperature TC (SRO) at higher dSRO , indi ating the\nin\u001duen e of the size e\u001be t of the SRO layer.\nIn order to study the possible magneti\n\non\u001cguration of Ru and Mn ions at 10 K, we\n\nhave measured the ZFC magneti hysteresis loop of these samples with the magneti \u001celd\noriented along the [100\u2104 and [001\u2104 dire tions of the substrate. The in-plane and out-of-plane\nZFC magneti hysteresis loops of two samples are shown in Fig. 5a. The in-plane and\nout-of-plane saturation magnetizations (MS ) of all samples are the same though their inplane and out-of-plane saturation magneti \u001celds are di\u001berent. The MS of some samples,\nextra ted from their ZFC in-plane and out-of-plane hysteresis loop after orre ting for the\nweak diamagneti response of the substrate, are shown in the Fig. 5b. This \u001cgure also\nin ludes the theoreti al value of MS al ulated from the spin-only MS of the LSMO (3.34\n\u03bcB /Mn)16 and SRO (1.6 \u03bcB /Ru)17 . The higher value of the measured MS , as ompared\n\nto the theoreti al one for the sample with n = 2 to 7, indi ates an enhan ement of the\nmagnetization.\nThe enhan e magnetization ould be due to the modi\u001c ation of the harge states of the\nRu and Mn ions at the interfa es, and thereby an in rease in the e\u001be tive thi kness of the\n18\n\ninterfa ial layer in superlatti e with the lower dSRO (< 4 u. .). In samples with dSRO > 4,\nthe e\u001be tive thi kness of the interfa ial layer de reases as the stoi hiometri SRO layer start\nto form. The interfa ial magneti roughness seems to suppressed ompletely by the strong\nlong range ordering of the ferromagneti moments of SRO and LSMO at still larger dSRO .\nHowever, measurements using ele tron energy loss spe tros opy should be perform to verify\nthe valen y assumptions, in parti ular the stabilization of the Ru5+ spin state.\nWe have demonstrated that in La0.7 Sr0.3 MnO3 and SrRuO3 superlatti es an antiferro5\n\n\fmagneti\n\noupling and in rease magnetization an be indu ed by hanging the SRO layer\n\nthi kness. We attribute these hanges to interfa ial magneti and ele tri disorder, whi h\nappears to heal as the SRO layer thi kness in reases and long range ordering of the magneti\nmoment asso iated with Ru ions be omes dominant.\nWe thank the \u001cnan ial support from the Centre Fran o-Indien pour la Promotion de\nla Re her he Avan ee/Indo-Fren h Centre for the Promotion of Advan e Resear h (CEFIPRA/IFCPAR) under Proje t No 2808-1.
