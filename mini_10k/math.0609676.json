Let v be the right regular representation of a compact quantum\ngroup G. Then ([6], Proposition 4.4) v contains all irreducible representations\nof G and each irreducible representation enters v with the multiplicity equal\nto its dimension. The result is certainly known for classical compact groups\n([1]). The aim of this paper is to give a short survey on this subject and to\nprovide a different proof of Woronowicz's result. The proof is an adaptation of\nthe corresponding result for classical compact groups and provides a concrete\ndecomposition of the right regular representation in irreducible components.\n\nQuantum groups have been studied in the last decades by a large number of\nmathematicians and physicists. There are several approaches to the theory of quantum groups but the one used in this paper is the C*-algebraic approach introduced\nby S. L. Woronowicz ([5], [6]).\nDefinition 1 ([6],Definition 2.1). A compact quantum group G is given by a pair\n(A,\u2206) with A a unital C*-algebra and \u2206 : A \u2192 A \u2297 A a unital \u2217-homomorphism\nwith the following properties:\n(1) The diagram is commutative\nA\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\n\u2206y\n\n\u2206\n\n\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192\n\nA\u2297A\n\uf8e6\n\uf8e6\u2206\u2297id\ny\n\nA \u2297 A \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 A \u2297 A \u2297 A\nid\u2297\u2206\n\n(2)\n(A \u2297 1)\u2206(A) = A \u2297 A\n(1 \u2297 A)\u2206(A) = A \u2297 A\nNote that the tensor product is the minimal tensor product and that there is no\nseparability assumption on A as in Woronowicz's original definition ([6], Definition\n2.1). The separability assumption was used by Woronowicz for proving the existence\nof the Haar state. In [4] Van Daele proved that this assumption is not necessary\n2000 Mathematics Subject Classification. 20G42, 46L05.\nKey words and phrases. compact quantum groups, right regular representation, irreducible\nrepresentation.\n1\n\n\f2\n\nRALUCA DUMITRU\n\nby showing that a Haar state exists and is unique without assuming that A is\nseparable. The result is the following:\nProposition 2 ([6], Theorem 2.3; [4], Proposition 2.4). Let G=(A,\u2206) be a compact\nquantum group. Then there exists a unique state h on A with the property\n(id \u2297 h)\u2206(a) = (h \u2297 id)\u2206(a) = h(a) * 1A\nThen h is called the Haar state on G. Note that the Haar state is not always\nfaithful as in the case of classical compact groups. There exists however a subset of\nA, denoted by A, on which h is faithful. A is called the Woronowicz-Hopf \u2217-algebra\nand is defined in terms of irreducible unitary representations of G. Applying the\nGNS construction to h we obtain a Hilbert space Hh , a representation \u03c0h of A and\na cyclic vector \u03beh . If a \u2208 A (or a \u2208 A) and f is a bounded linear functional (on A\nor A), we denote ([5], [6])\na \u2217 f = (f \u2297 \u03b9)(\u2206(a))\nf \u2217 a = (\u03b9 \u2297 f )(\u2206(a))\nBoth a \u2217 f and f \u2217 a are elements of A (respectively A).\nLet H be a Hilbert space and denote by K(H) the set of compact operators on\nH. A unitary representation u of G acting on a Hilbert space H is a unitary element\nin the multiplier algebra M(K(H) \u2297 A) with the property (id \u2297 \u2206)u = u12 u13 . The\nleg numbering notation used (u12 , u13 ) is the one obtained from the two possible\ninclusions of K(H) \u2297 A in K(H) \u2297 A \u2297 A. The representation u is called irreducible\nif the operators intertwining u (i.e. S \u2208 B(Hu ) such that (S \u2297 1)u = u(S \u2297 1),\nwhere Hu denotes the Hilbert space on which u acts) are scalar multiples of the\nidentity. If u is irreducible then it is finite dimensional (i.e. dimHu < \u221e) and\nif we denote by d = dimHu then d is called the dimension of u. By choosing an\northonormal basis in Hu , the Hilbert space of an irreducible representation u, we\ncan identify u with a matrix (uij )16i,j6d over A.\nTwo unitary representations u and v are called equivalent (denoted by u \u223c v)\nif and only if there exists U : Hu \u2192 Hv unitary such that (U \u2297 1)u = v(U \u2297 1). Let\nb denote the dual of G, i.e. the set of all unitary equivalence classes of irreducible\nG\nb denote by u\u03b1 a representative\nrepresentations of G ([5], [6]).

The set of intertwiners of v and the definition of C \u2217 (G) are given in the following\ntheorem:\nTheorem 5 ([6], Theorem 4.1). Let v be the right regular representation of a\ncompact quantum group G = (A, \u2206). Let C \u2217 (G) be the norm closure of the set of\nall operators of the form\nFv (a) = (id \u2297 ha)(v \u2217 ),\nwhere a \u2208 A.

Then Eij (u\u03b1\nrs ) = \u03b4sj (uri )\nand therefore Ekl Eij = \u03b4il Ekj . The operator Eij can be represented as a block\ndiagonal matrix. Each d\u03b1 \u00d7 d\u03b1 block on the diagonal is given by the matrix mij =\n[akl ]16k,l6d\u03b1 , for all 1 6 i, j 6 d\u03b1 , where\n(\n1, if k=i and l=j\nakl =\n0, otherwise.\n\nThe application Eij 7\u2212\u2192 mij , 1 6 i, j 6 d\u03b1 establishes an isomorphism between\nC \u2217 (G)p\u03b1 and the full matrix algebra Md\u03b1 \u00d7d\u03b1 . Since the algebras C \u2217 (G)p\u03b1 and\n\u0003\nMd\u03b1 \u00d7d\u03b1 are finite dimensional, they are \u2217-isomorphic.\n\n\fUNITARY REPRESENTATIONS\n\n5\n\nRemark 8. Since the unit p\u03b1 of B(Hh (u\u03b1 )) belongs to C \u2217 (G)p\u03b1 , then C \u2217 (G)p\u03b1\nis a subfactor of B(Hh (u\u03b1 )). Using ([2], page 118) B(Hh (u\u03b1 )) is isomorphic to\nC \u2217 (G)p\u03b1 \u2297 (C \u2217 (G)p\u03b1 )\u2032 and, by reasons of dimension, (C \u2217 (G)p\u03b1 )\u2032 is isomorphic to\nthe full matrix algebra Md\u03b1 \u00d7d\u03b1 .\nThe description of the right regular representation is given by S. L. Woronowicz ([6], Proposition 5.4). He proved that every irreducible representation enters\nthe right regular representation with the multiplicity equal to its dimension. The\nresult is certainly known for classical compact groups (see for instance [1], Section\n27.49). A. Maes and A. Van Daele ([3], Theorem 6.7) gave a simpler proof to the\nfact that every irreducible representation is contained in the right regular representation. The aim of this paper is to give a proof of Woronowicz's result, including\nthe multiplicities, which is an adaptation of the corresponding result for classical\ncompact groups and is different from both Woronowicz's and Maes and Van Daele's\nproofs. The proof we give is based on the structure of C \u2217 (G) and its commutant and\nprovides a concrete decomposition of the right regular representation in irreducible\ncomponents.\nProposition 9 ([6], Proposition 5.4).
