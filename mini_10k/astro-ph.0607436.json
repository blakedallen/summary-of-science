Combined with the CDM model it leads to the picture of hierarchical clustering with wide support from deep galaxy and\ncluster observations. During the recent phase of cosmic evolution groups and clusters of galaxies condense from large\nscale density enhancements, and they grow by accretion and\nmerger processes of the environmental cosmic matter.\nBut despite the fact that the currently favoured \u039bCDM\nmodel has proven to be remarkably successful on large scales\n(cf. WMAP results, Spergel et al. 2003, Spergel et al. 2006),\nrecent high\u2013resolution N -body simulations still seem to be in\ncontradiction with observation on sub\u2013galactic scales. There\nis, for instance, the problem with the steep central densities\nof galactic halos as the highest resolution simulations favor a cusp with a logarithmic inner slope for the density\nprofile of approximately \u22121.2 (Diemand, Moore & Stadel\n2005; Fukushige, Kawai & Makino 2004; Power et al. 2003),\nwhereas high resolution observations of low surface brightness galaxies are best fit by halos with a core of constant\ndensity (Simon et al. 2005; de Block & Bosma 2002; Swaters et al. 2003). A further problem relates to the overabunc 0000 RAS\n\ndance of small\u2013sized (satellite) halos; there are many more\nsubhaloes predicted by cosmological simulations than actually observed in nearby galaxies (e.g., Moore et al. 1998,\nKlypin et al. 1999, Gottl\u00f6ber et al. 2003). The lack of observational evidence for these satellites has led to the suggestion\nthat they are completely (or almost completely) dark, with\nstrongly suppressed star formation due to the removal of gas\nfrom the small protogalaxies by the ionising radiation from\nthe first stars and quasars (Bullock et al. 2000; Tully et al.\n2002; Somerville 2002; Hoeft et al. 2005). Other authors suggest that perhaps low mass satellites never formed in the\npredicted numbers in the first place, indicating problems\nwith the \u039bCDM model in general, which is replaced with\nWarm Dark Matter instead (Knebe et al. 2002; Bode, Ostriker & Turok 2001; Col\u0131\u0301n et al. 2000). Suggested solutions\nalso include the introduction of self-interactions into collisionless N -body simulations (e.g. Spergel & Steinhardt 2000;\nBento et al. 2000), and non-standard modifications to an\notherwise unperturbed CDM power spectrum (e.g. bumpy\npower spectra: Little, Knebe & Islam 2003; tilted CDM: Bullock 2001c). Recent results from (strong) lensing statistics\nthough suggest that the predicted excess of substructure is\nin fact required to reconcile some observations with theory\n(Dahle et al. 2003, Dalal & Kochanek 2002), but this con-\n\n\f2\n\nKnebe A. et al.\n\nclusion has not been universally accepted (Sand et al. 2004;\nSchechter & Wambsganss 2002; Evans & Witt 2003).\nThe discovery of the mismatch between observations\nand simulations is a result of the increase in the resolution of N -body simulations over the last years. This has\nemphasized the importance of the influence of subresolution\nscales on the simulated dynamics, at least when it comes\nto halo properties. The purpose of this work is to study\nthe hydrodynamic\u2013like formulation of the formation of cosmologial structure proposed recently by Dom\u0131\u0301nguez (2000),\ndubbed SSE (small\u2013size expansion). The SSE addresses explicitly the existence of a finite spatial resolution and the\ndynamical effect of subresolution degrees of freedom. Although developed independently, the SSE approach is close\nin spirit to the Large\u2013Eddy Simulation of turbulent flow\n(see, e.g., Pope 2000 and refs. therein). This is a method\ndevised to simulate only the relevant, large\u2013scale degrees of\nfreedom according to the Navier\u2013Stokes equations describing\nflow in the high\u2013Reynolds number (i.e., turbulent) regime:\nphysically meaningful approximations are made in order to\nmodel the coupling to the neglected, small\u2013scale degrees of\nfreedom.\nThe SSE starts from the microscopic equations of motion for a set of N particles under their mutual gravity\nand provides a set of hydrodynamic-like equations for the\n(coarse\u2013grained) mass density and velocity fields. These new\nequations now contain \"correction terms\" which describe\nthe effects of the coarse\u2013graining procedure and correct for\nthem, respectively. It therefore only appears natural to implement these correction terms into an (adaptive) mesh N body code where the density is treated in a coarse\u2013grained\nfashion, too: mesh\u2013based Poisson solvers frequently used for\ncosmological simulations smooth the particle distribution\nonto a grid and hence deal with a coarse\u2013grained density\nfield when solving for the potential via Poisson's equation.\nFor this purpose we will adapt the open source N -body code\nMLAPM (Multi-Level Adaptive Particle\u2013Mesh)\u22c6 . The particles\nof the N -body simulations presented in this study are effectively hydrodynamical Lagrangian particles which move under the action not only of the mesh\u2013computed gravitational\nforce, but also of the additional, correction terms modeling\nsub\u2013grid degrees of freedom in the context of the SSE.\nThe rest of the work is structured as follows: in Sec. 2 we\ndescribe the theoretical background of the SSE and provide\nthe link to mesh\u2013based N -body codes. In Sec. 3 we present\nthe simulation of several models (standard \u039bCDM model,\n\u039bWDM model, and two runs incorporating the SSE corrections). In Sec. 4 we perform a comparative analysis of the\nfour runs at redshift z = 0 from two complementary points\nof view: properties of the mass density and velocity fields,\nand properties of halos. Finally, Sec. 5 includes a discussion\nof the results and the conclusions.\n\n2\n\nTHE HYDRODYNAMIC APPROACH\n\nWe deal with a system of nonrelativistic, identical point particles which (i) are supposed to interact with each other via\n\n\u22c6 Available at http://www.aip.de/People/AKnebe/MLAPM\n\ngravity only, (ii) look homogeneously distributed on sufficiently large scales, so that the evolution at such scales corresponds to an expanding Friedmann-Lema\u0131\u0302tre cosmological\nbackground, and (iii) deviations to homogeneity are relevant\nonly on scales small enough that a Newtonian approximation is valid to follow their evolution. Let a(t) then denote\nthe expansion factor of the Friedmann-Lema\u0131\u0302tre cosmological background, H(t) = \u0227/a the associated Hubble function,\nand \u033ab (t) the homogeneous (background) density on large\nscales. x\u03b1 is the comoving spatial coordinate of the \u03b1-th\nparticle, u\u03b1 = a\u1e8b\u03b1 its peculiar velocity, and m its mass. In\nterms of these variables the evolution is described by the following set of equations (Peebles 1980) (\u2207\u03b1 denotes a partial\nderivative with respect to x\u03b1 ):\n\u1e8b\u03b1\n\n=\n\nu\u0307\u03b1\n\n=\n\n1\nu\u03b1 ,\na\nw\u03b1 \u2212 Hu\u03b1 ,\n\n\u2207\u03b1 * w \u03b1\n\n=\n\n\u22124\u03c0Ga\n\n\u2207\u03b1 \u00d7 w \u03b1\n\n=\n\n0,\n\n\"\n\n(1a)\n(1b)\n\n#\n\nm X (3)\n\u03b4 (x\u03b1 \u2212 x\u03b2 ) \u2212 \u033ab , (1c)\na3\n\u03b26=\u03b1\n\n(1d)\n\nwhere w\u03b1 is the peculiar gravitational acceleration acting\non the \u03b1-th particle. Finally, Eqs. (1) must be subjected to\nperiodic boundary conditions in order to yield a Newtonian\ndescription consistent with the Friedmann-Lema\u0131\u0302tre solution\non large scales (Buchert & Ehlers 1997).\nIf we now assume that the actual measure of the density\nfield in an N -body code depends on a smoothing window\nW (z), the microscopic field \u033amic relates to the measured\n(coarse\u2013grained) field \u033a in the following way:\n\u033amic (x, t)\n\n=\n\nm X (3)\n\u03b4 (x \u2212 x\u03b1 (t)),\na(t)3\n\n(2a)\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u033a(x, t; L)\n\n=\n\nZ\n\ndy\nW\nL3\n\n\u0012\n\n|x \u2212 y|\nL\n\n\u0013\n\n\u033amic (y, t).\n\n(2b)\n\nThe physical interpretation of the field \u033a(x; L) follows\nstraightforwardly from the properties of the smoothing window: it is proportional to the number of particles contained\nwithin the coarsening cell of size \u2248 L centered at x. A microscopic peculiar\u2013momentum density field and the corresponding coarse\u2013grained field can be defined in the same\nway:\njmic (x, t)\n\n=\n\nm X\nu\u03b1 (t) \u03b4 (3) (x \u2212 x\u03b1 (t)),\na(t)3\n\n(3a)\n\n\u03b1\n\nj(x, t; L)\n\n=\n\nZ\n\ndy\nW\nL3\n\n\u0012\n\n|x \u2212 y|\nL\n\n\u0013\n\njmic (y, t).\n\n(3b)\n\nOne can introduce peculiar velocity fields umic and u by\ndefinition as j =: \u033a u and similarly for umic . The physical\nmeaning of u(x; L) is also simple: it is the center-of-mass\npeculiar velocity of the subsystem defined by the particles\ninside the coarsening cell of size \u2248 L centered at x. Notice\nthat u is not obtained by coarse-graining umic : from a dynamical point of view, it is more natural to coarse\u2013grain the\nmomentum rather than the velocity, since the former is an\nadditive quantity for a system of particles. Finally, one can\ndefine peculiar gravitational acceleration fields wmic and w\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fHydrodynamic Approch to Cosmic Structures\nthrough coarse\u2013graining of the force:\nm X\nw\u03b1 (t) \u03b4 (3) (x \u2212 x\u03b1 (t)),\n\u033amic wmic (x, t) =\na(t)3\n\n(4a)\n\n\u03b1\n\n\u033a w(x, t; L)\n\n=\n\nZ\n\ndy\nW\nL3\n\n\u0012\n\n|x \u2212 y|\nL\n\n\u0013\n\n\u033amic wmic (y, (4b)\nt).\n\nThe field w(x) has the physical meaning of the center-ofmass peculiar gravitational acceleration of the subsystem\ndefined by the coarsening cell at x.\nFrom these definitions and Eqs. (1), it is straightforward to derive the evolution equations obeyed by the coarse\u2013\ngrained fields \u033a and u (from now on, \u2202/\u2202t is taken at constant x and L, and \u2207 means partial derivative with respect\nto x):\n\u2202\u033a\n1\n+ 3H\u033a = \u2212 \u2207 * (\u033a u),\n\u2202t\na\n\n(5a)\n\n\u2202(\u033a u)\n1\n+ 4H\u033a u = \u033a w \u2212 \u2207 * (\u033a u u + \u03a0),\n(5b)\n\u2202t\na\nwhere a new second-rank tensor field has been defined\n(dyadic notation):\n\u03a0(x, t; L)\n\n=\n\nZ\n\ndy\nW\nL3\n\n\u0012\n\n|x \u2212 y|\nL\n\n\u0013\n\n\u033amic (y, t)\n\n(6)\n\n[umic (y, t) \u2212 u(x, t; L)][umic (y, t) \u2212 u(x, t; L)].\nThe field \u03a0(x) is due to the velocity dispersion, i.e., to the\nfact that the particles in the coarsening cell have in general a velocity different from that of the center of mass. The\nphysical meaning of Eqs. (5) is simple: they are just balance equations, stating mass conservation and momentum\nconservation, respectively. The term \u033a w codifies the gravitational interaction between the coarsening cells and does not\nsatify, in general, Poisson's equation or the curl\u2013free condition. The term \u2207 * \u03a0 represents a kinetic pressure force due\nto the exchange of particles between neighboring coarsening\ncells (just like for an ideal gas) and it has the same physical\norigin as the convective term \u2207 * (\u033a u u), i.e., a nonlinear\nmode-mode coupling of the velocity field. The difference is\nthat the convective term couples only modes on scales > L,\nwhile the velocity dispersion term codifies the dynamical effect of the coupling of the modes on scales > L with the\nmodes on scales < L. Eqs. (5) are exact: as one changes the\nsmoothing length, the fields \u033a, u, w, \u03a0 change in such a\nway that the form of the equations remains the same (for\nexample, upon increase of the smoothing length, part of the\ndynamical effect described by \u2207 * (\u033a u u) is shifted towards\n\u2207 * \u03a0). This property is reflected in that the equations are\nnot an autonomous system for \u033a and u. In fact, they are just\nthe first ones of an infinite hierarchy, as can be checked by\ncomputing the evolution equations for the fields w and \u03a0.\nTo obtain a useful set of equations, it is necesary to truncate\nthis hierarchy by looking for a functional dependence of w\nand \u03a0 on \u033a and u.\nThe peculiarities of the problem at hand (collisionless\nmatter in the non\u2013stationary state of structure formation)\nprevent the usual truncation of the hierarchy leading to\nthe Euler or Navier\u2013Stokes equations, respectively (see, e.g.,\nChapman & Cowling 1991). The small\u2013size expansion (SSE)\nis a specific truncation for this problem (Dom\u0131\u0301nguez 2000,\n2002; Buchert & Dom\u0131\u0301nguez 2005), that starts from the\nphysical assumption that the coupling to the small\u2013scales\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n3\n\nis weak (this can be argued on the basis that, in a hierarchical scenario, the smaller scales \"virialize\" earlier and thus\n\"decouple\" from the evolution of the larger scales). Then\nthe fields \u03a0 and w are derived as a formal expansion in L:\nKeeping terms up to order L2 , Eqs.

(7) reduce to the \"dust (pressureless) approximation\" for cosmological structure formation (Sahni\n& Coles 1995): wmf represents the mean\u2013field gravity created by the monopole moment of the matter distribution\nin the coarsening cells, i.e., the total mass, and the coupling to the small\u2013scales is neglected altogether. To order\nL2 there are two kinds of corrections: the term proportional\nto the tidal tensor \u2207wmf (stemming from a term w\u2212wmf in\nEqs. (5)) models the gravitational force of the higher\u2013order\nmultipole moments, i.e., the coupling to the subresolution\nconfigurational degrees of freedom; the term proportional to\n(\u2202i u)(\u2202i u) (stemming from \u03a0 in Eqs. (5)) models the effect\nof velocity dispersion, that is, the coupling to the subresolution kinetic degrees of freedom.\nThe expected dynamical effect of these new terms with\nrespect to the \"dust evolution\" has been studied theoretically (Dom\u0131\u0301nguez 2000, 2002; Buchert & Dom\u0131\u0301nguez 2005).\nThere is evidence that, assuming a locally plane\u2013parallel\ncollapse, these terms mimick the \"adhesion model\" (Gurbatov, Saichev & Shandarin 1989, Sahni & Coles 1995), in\nwhich recently collapsed regions stabilize - or more generally speaking, the term due to velocity dispersion tends\nto reduce the inflow velocity in collapsing regions and favors the formation of gravitationally bound systems. It has\nalso been shown that the correction terms act as a source\nof vorticity via small\u2013scale tidal forces and shear stresses.\nThe \"dust model\" lacks a source of vorticity \u03c9 = \u2207 \u00d7 u,\nand the initially present one is damped by the cosmological\nexpansion in the linear regime. Thus, in that respect the corrections to the \"dust model\" can be particularly important.\nTaking the curl of Eq. (7b) we obtain\n\u2202\u03c9\n1\n= \u2212 H\u03c9 + \u2207 \u00d7 (u \u00d7 \u03c9) + \u2207 \u00d7 C ,\n\u2202t\na\n\n(10)\n\nwhere the term \u2207\u00d7C is a source of vorticity, i.e., it does not\nvanish in general even if \u03c9 = 0, as has been confirmed perturbatively by Dom\u0131\u0301nguez (2002). We comment further on\nthe relationship between vorticity and angular momentum\n\n\f4\n\nKnebe A. et al.\n\nin App. A, where also some results concerning the conservation of energy, momentum, and angular momentum are\nderived.\nThe dynamical evolution predicted by Eqs. (7) can\nbe implemented without much difficulties in a particle\u2013\nmesh (PM) code of N -body simulation. Mass conservation,\nEq. (7a), is automatically satisfied by the code. The acceleration wmf given by Eqs. (7c) and (7d) agrees with the value\nreturned by the Poisson solver on a grid, and the grid constant sets naturally the resolution L. In principle, one only\nneeds to take care of Eq. (7b), which can be re-written in\nLagrangian coordinates as\nu\u0307 = wmf \u2212 Hu + C.\n\n(11)\n\nThe computation of C, given by Eq. (8), on the grid of the\nPoisson solver is a highly non-trivial but manageable task.\nThus, Eq. (11) - together with \u1e8b = u/a, see Eq. (1a) -\ndetermines the motion of Lagrangian fluid elements, which\nare sampled by the particles of the simulation. If we set\nB = 0 (\u21d2 C = 0) in Eq. (11) we recover the equations of\nmotions that are being integrated in a standard PM code\nfor the update of particle velocities and positions during the\ncourse of the simulation.\n\n3\n3.1\n\nTHE N -BODY SIMULATIONS\nThe Setup\n\nThe N -body simulations presented in this study were carried\nout using a version of the open source adaptive mesh refinement code MLAPM (Knebe, Green & Binney 2001). This code\nreaches high force resolution by refining high-density regions\nwith an automated refinement algorithm. These adaptive\nmeshes are recursive: refined regions can also be refined,\neach subsequent refinement having cells that are half the\nsize of the cells in the previous level. This creates a hierarchy of refinement meshes of different resolutions covering\nregions of interest. The refinement is done cell by cell (individual cells can be refined or de-refined) and meshes are\nnot constrained to have a rectangular (or any other) shape.\nThe criterion for (de-)refining a cell is simply the number of\nparticles within that cell and a detailed study of the appropriate choice for this number can be found elsewhere (Knebe\net al. 2001). The code also uses multiple time steps on different refinement levels where the time step for each level\nis two times smaller than the step on the previous level.\nThe latest version of MLAPM also includes an adaptive time\nstepping that adjusts the actual time step after every major\nstep to restrict particle movement across a cell to a particular fraction of the cell spacing, hence, fine tuning accuracy\nand computational time.\nAs outlined above, the only necessary modification required to model the \"Hydrodynamic APProxImation\" (or\n\"HAPPI\" here afterwards) is to account for the correction\nterm C in Eq. (11) when updating the particle velocities\u2020 .\nMLAPM has therefore been modified to not only calculate\nthe density field on its hierarchy of nested refinement grids\nbut also the velocity field. The \u2207-operator and spatial\n\u2020 The modifications are part of MLAPM v1.4 (and all later versions)\nand can be switched on using -DHAPPI upon compile time.\n\nderivatives, respectively, have been approximated by finitedifferences using the two nearest neighbors (in each dimension) to the cell for which the correction term is being calculated. Cells close to a refinement boundary for which not\nenough surrounding nodes are present, obtain their correction values interpolated downwards from the next coarser\ngrid level. The assignment of mass and momentum on the\ngrid is done with a triangular\u2013shaped\u2013cloud window (Hockney & Eastwood 1988),\nW (z) =\n\n\uf8f1\n\uf8f2\n\uf8f3\n\n3\n4\n1\n2\n\n0\n\n\u2212 z2\n\u00012\n3\n\u2212 |z|\n2\n\nfor |z| \u2264 0.5,\nfor 0.5 < |z| \u2264 1.5,\notherwise,\n\n(12)\n\nfor which B = 1/4 according to Eq. (9). We remark that,\ndue to the dynamical (de)refinement procedure of the MLAPM\ncode, the resolution is space\u2013dependent in a discrete manner, while Eqs. (7) were derived under the assumption of\na spatially homogeneous length L. The SSE can be generalized to the case of a smoothly varying L(x) (Dom\u0131\u0301nguez,\nunpublished; Dom\u0131\u0301nguez 2002 contains the generalization to\na time\u2013dependent L), but we have neglected this additional\ncomplication because the fraction of particles which are in\nregions where L jumps is less than 1% during the run. Finally, we also note that this numerical method of integrating\nthe hydrodynamic equations is different from, albeit similar\nto, the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics method (Gingold\n& Monaghan 1977; Lucy 1977) frequently used in cosmological simulations involving baryonic matter.\nWe ran four CDM simulations with cosmological parameters in agreement with the so-called concordance model, i.e.\n\u03a90 = 1/3, \u03bb0 = 2/3, \u03c38 = 0.88, h = 2/3:\n\u2022 one standard \u039bCDM model,\n\u2022 one \u039bWDM model (mWDM = 0.5keV),\n\u2022 two \u039bCDM models with B=1/4 and B=1, respectively.\nEven though B is actually determined by the smoothing\nwindow, we also considered a four times larger value as if\nit were a free parameter of the model. This model is to be\nunderstood as an \"academic toy model\" where we hope to\ngain better insight into the effects of the correction term on\ncosmological structure formation.\nAll simulations consist of N = 1283 particles in a box of\nside length 25h\u22121 Mpc (the mass of a simulation particle is\nmpart \u2248 7 \u00d7 108 h\u22121 M\u2299 ), and they were started at redshift\nz = 35. The two \u039bCDM models with B 6=0 are also dubbed\n\u039bCDMhappi1 (B=1/4) and \u039bCDMhappi2 (B=1). We chose\nto also run a \u039bWDM model to allow for a more complete\ncomparision of the new HAPPI models to other, alternative\ncosmologies. A more elaborate study of the \u039bWDM model\nand Warm Dark Matter can be found in Knebe et al. (2002).\nThe force resolution in MLAPM is determined by the finest\nrefinement level reached throughout the run. While all four\nmodels applied exactly the same refinement criterion (six\nparticles per cell), the \u039bCDMhappi2 run only invoked five\nrefinement levels whereas all other runs used seven levels\nat redshift z = 0. In terms of force resolution this translates to 10h\u22121 kpc spatial resolution for \u039bCDMhappi2 (corresponding to an estimated maximum density \u223c 5 \u00d7 104 \u033ab )\nand 2.5h\u22121 kpc for all the other models (maximum density \u223c 3 \u00d7 106 \u033ab ). This difference can be ascribed to the\nsmoothening effect of the correction terms in the dynamical\nequations that are more effective for higher values of B.\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fHydrodynamic Approch to Cosmic Structures\n\n5\n\nTable 1.

(A5)) following\nfrom the Layzer\u2013Irvine equation (e.g., Knebe et al. 2001).\nThis is not the case for the two HAPPI models, since the\ncorrection term C is a source or drain of energy as discussed\nin the App. A. We though chose to plot in Fig. 1 the dimensionless quantity\n\u0128(t) =\n\nI(t) \u2212 I(t1 )\n,\naU mf (t)\n\n(14)\n\nas a function of cosmic expansion factor a, where U mf is\nthe mean\u2013field potential energy defined in Eqs. (A1). For\nthe \u039bCDM and \u039bWDM models, the Layzer\u2013Irvine equation\nholds and predicts \u0128 = 0. Departures from this result are ascribed to both integration/truncation errors introduced by\nthe code and the fact that the particle shape is neither constant in time nor space due to the adaptive nature of MLAPM\n(cf. Knebe et al. 2001). \u039bCDMhappi1 performs rather similar to the standard CDM model, indicating that the effect of\nthe correction term C in the evolution of I is small compared\nto the numerical errors. \u039bCDMhappi2, on the other hand,\ndeparts noticeably from the other models and \u0128 changes sign\nat around a redshift of z \u2248 3, which lets us expect to find\nlarger differences between \u039bCDMhappi2 and \u039bCDM.\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\nlow-density\n\nhigh-density\n\n10%\n14%\n16%\n14%\n\n6%\n9%\n12%\n23%\n\nThe Importance of the HAPPI correction\n\nIn order to test the importance of the correction term Eq. (8)\nwe calculated the ratio of the mean\u2013field acceleration (i.e.\nF = |wmf |) and the additional acceleration (C = |C|) for\neach individual particle as a function of the local density at\nvarious redshifts. The result for the \u039bCDMhappi2 model, for\nwhich the effect of C is the largest, can be viewed in Fig. 2.\nThis figure indicates that the effect of the newly added terms\nis generally rather small especially at late times. At redshift\nz = 0 the fraction of all particles with F/C < 1 (\"HAPPI\nparticles\") is a mere 9% while it increases to 15% at z = 4. In\norder to examine a possible trend with density, we consider\nat each redshift two subsets of particles according to whether\nthe density is above or below the virial overdensity \u2206vir (cf.\nEq. (17) in Section 4.2) and hence particles of the highdensity subset either already belong to virialized structures\nor will be part of them at a later time. Table 1 gives the\nfraction of HAPPI particles in each subset.\nThis raises the question about the exact locations as\nwell as the \"dynamics\" of HAPPI particles. A visual inspection shows that, at high redshift, they are preferentially\nlocated within the filaments flowing towards halos. At later\ntimes though, they can be found either in regions of strong\ndynamical activity (e.g., mergers, the outskirts of halos and\ninfalling to halos), or at the very centres of relaxed systems.\nThe smaller spatial force resolution of the \u039bCDMhappi2\nmentioned earlier can hence be linked to the influence of\nthe HAPPI particles at the very centres of halos.\n\n4\n4.1\n\nANALYSIS OF THE MATTER\nDISTRIBUTION\nLarge Scale Structure and Global Properties\n\nA visual impression of the density field of the particle distribution at redshift z = 0 for all four models is shown in Fig. 3,\nwhere the local density at each particle position was determined by smoothing the distribution onto a regular grid\n(2563 nodes) and interpolating the density on the mesh back\nto the particle positions. Not surprisingly, the \u039bWDM model\nappears less clumpy and far smoother than the \u039bCDM simulation. However, there appears to be more small scale structure in both the HAPPI runs, or at least the smaller objects\nare more contrasted. We can readily relate this phenomenon\nto the influence of B and larger B values give higher contrasts (remember that the fiducial \u039bCDM model is nothing\nelse than a HAPPI model with B=0). But despite the more\ngrainy appearance of the HAPPI runs in Fig. 3, the power on\nsmall scales is reduced compared to the power of the \u039bCDM\nmodel. This can be verified in Fig. 4, where we plot the dark\nmatter power spectrum of density fluctuations for all four\n\n\f6\n\nKnebe A. et al.\n\nFigure 2. The correction term in comparison to the mean\u2013field force acting on a single particle as a function of density.

The vertical line indicates the virial overdensity at the respective redshift. The number in each quadrant lists the total number of\nparticles in this regime of the plot.\n\nmodels at redshifts z = 3 (lower curves) and z = 0 (upper curves). Especially \u039bCDMhappi2 falls behind \u039bCDM\neven though it appears to be marginally more evolved at\nhigher redshift. We will though see that these two results,\nthe \"graininess\" of the \u039bCDMhappi2 model and the lack of\nsmall scale power, do not exclude each other. The absence\nof small scale power on scales below \u223c 1\u20132 h\u22121 Mpc reflects\nthe fact that the halos corresponding to those scales (i.e. halos of mass > 1011 h\u22121 M\u2299 ) are internally less concentrated\nthan their \u039bCDM counterparts.\n\n4.1.1\n\nBeyond the two\u2013point estimators\n\nTwo\u2013point estimators like the power spectrum are sensitive only to the amplitude of the modes of the fluctuating field \u033a(x) \u2212 \u033ab . The information concerning the relative phases is contained in the higher\u2013order correlations. In\n\nthe literature there have been several meaningful quantities proposed depending on higher\u2013order correlations with\na more or less transparent physical interpretation. In this\nwork, we have employed the scalar Minkowski functionals\n(MFs) (see, e.g., Mecke & Stoyan 2000; Dom\u0131\u0301nguez 2001),\nwhich allow a quantification of the morphological aspects\nappreciated by visual inspections. Given a density field \u033a(x)\nand a density threshold \u03c1\u0302, one constructs the isodensity surface S = {x|\u033a(x) = \u03c1\u0302} (with the convention that the region \u033a > \u03c1\u0302 is taken as the interior of S). The four MFs\nV\u03bd , \u03bd = 0, 1, 2, 3, can be defined as surface integrals over S\nand have the following geometrical meaning (up to a conventional constant prefactor):\nV0\nV1\nV2 /V1\n\n\u221d\n\n\u221d\n\n\u221d\n\nvolume enclosed by the isodensity surface S\n\ntotal area of S\n\nmean curvature of S, averaged over S\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fHydrodynamic Approch to Cosmic Structures\n\n7\n\nFigure 3.

This (physical)\neffect has been already noticed concerning the final force\nresolution of the runs: it is due to the larger effect of the\nadditional acceleration C and can be directly linked to the\nlocation of \"HAPPI particles\" at redshift z = 0 at the center\nof relaxed structures, see Secs. 3.1 and 3.3.\n\n0.5\nV3/V3ref-1\n\nV\u03bd\n\u22121\nV\u03bdref\n\n(V1/V0)(V0/V1)ref-1\n\nferent realizations of the field by displacing randomly the\ngrid and we present the MFs averaged over these realizations. The MFs are functions of the grid constant and the\ndensity threshold. We observe that the measurement of the\nMFs in an N -body simulation is affected by two kinds of\nerrors (which are more pronounced for higher orders \u03bd of\nthe MF V\u03bd ):\n(i) Finite\u2013volume effects: the tails of the probability distribution of the density field cannot be probed correctly in a\nfinite volume, so that the measured MFs are noisy and take\ndiscrete values (due to the grid) as the threshold approaches\nthe extremal values probed in a given simulation. This effect\ncan be reduced by increasing the number of realizations.\n(ii) Finite\u2013mass effects: at threshold values corresponding\nto <\n\u223c 1-10 particles per grid node, the MFs detect that the\ndensity field is actually derived from a distribution of point\nparticles.\nIn order to emphasize the differences between the four\nsimulations and to facilitate the physical interpretation, we\nplotted as a function of \u03c1\u0302 the relative difference between\na measure in one model and the corresponding one in the\nreference \u039bCDM model (denoted by 'ref'):\n\n0.2\n\n(V2/V1)(V1/V2)ref-1\n\nFigure 4.

Minkowski functionals vs. density threshold at redshift z = 0. The threshold is given in units of particles per grid\nnode. The grid has 1283 nodes, corresponding to a grid constant\n0.20h\u22121 Mpc, so that the threshold coincides with the ratio \u033a/\u033ab\nfor this spatial resolution.\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\f9\n\nHydrodynamic Approch to Cosmic Structures\nThe results can be summarized as follows:\n\nWe have repeated the analysis at different spatial resolutions\n(163 , 323 , 643 and 2563 nodes) for the Minkowski functionals. The quantitative differences between models decrease\nas the grid becomes coarser, but the same conclusions hold\nroughly in a qualitative manner.\nSummarizing, the \u039bWDM run has less voids and more\nfilamentary\u2013like structures than the reference \u039bCDM model,\nwhile the HAPPI runs have comparatively more mass concentrated in small, roundish clusters.\n\n4.1.2\n\nThe velocity field\n\nMotivated by the theoretical discussion, we have also addressed the distribution of the (comoving) vorticity, \u03c9 =\n\u2207 \u00d7 u, and the (comoving) divergence, \u03b8 = \u2207 * u, of the peculiar velocity field u(x). Using the positions and velocities\nof the particles, we compute the fields \u03c9(x) and \u03b8(x) on a\nregular grid (see Sec. 3). The cumulative probabilities that\n|\u03c9|2 > \u03c9\u0302 2 and that \u03b82 > \u03b8\u03022 are given by the first Minkowski\nfunctional V0 , which we compute as explained previously.\nFig. 6 shows P/P ref \u2212 1, where P is the cumulative\nprobability measured in a simulation, and P ref is the corresponding probability in the reference \u039bCDM simulation.\nThe \u039bCDMhappi2 model shows a clear tendency to have a\nlarger vorticity and a lower divergence (in absolute value)\nthan the \u039bCDM model. The vorticity in the \u039bCDMhappi1\nmodel exhibits a similar tendency, but the differences are\nquantitatively smaller. In order to minimize finite\u2013mass effects, we considered only grid nodes for which the value of\nthe smoothed density field corresponds to more than 10 particle per node. If we restrict the measurement of the probability distributions to higher densities, the quantitative differences tend to be smaller.\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n0.4\n(relative) cumulative prob.\n\n\u2022 The dependence V0 (\u03c1\u0302) quantifies the visual impression\nthat low\u2013density regions (\u033a <\n\u223c 10\u033ab ) are clearly less likely\nin the WDM model, while overdense regions (10 <\n\u223c \u033a/\u033ab <\n\u223c\n103 ) are more abundant in the HAPPI models. As remarked,\nhigher density areas are rarer in \u039bCDMhappi2 and more\nfrequent in \u039bCDMhappi1 compared to \u039bCDM.\n\u2022 From the fact that V2 , V3 > 0 (not shown in the plot) in\nthe whole range of threshold values, one infers that, observed\nat the resolution of 1283 nodes, the matter distribution consists mainly of \"clusters\" (i.e., disconnected objects which\nare convex on average). According to the plot of (V2 /V1 )(\u03c1\u0302),\nthese clusters in the HAPPI runs tend to be rounder than\nin the \u039bCDM run, while they tend to be more cigar\u2013shaped\n(filament\u2013like) in the \u039bWDM model. From the plot of V3 (\u03c1\u0302)\none deduces that the \u039bWDM model has less clusters at all\nthreshold values; the HAPPI runs have more clusters, except\nfor \u039bCDMhappi2 at very high densities because this particular model does not reach as high densities as the other\nones.\n\u2022 Finally, the plot of (V1 /V0 )(\u03c1\u0302) shows that matter is\nmore compactly packed in the \u039bWDM model, and less compactly in the HAPPI runs. This is likely due to the different\ncluster abundances just discussed.\n\nhappi1\nhappi2\nWDM\n\n0.2\n\n0\n\n-0.2\n\n1283 nodes\n\n-0.4\n10-2\n\n10-1\n\n100\n101\nthreshold\n\n102\n\n103\n\nFigure 6.

This newly developed halo finder uses the adaptive\ngrid structure invoked by the N -body code MLAPM and reorganizes it into a tree. The centres of the grids at the endleaves of a branch of the tree serve as (potential) halo centres\nand all gravitationally bound particles about these centres\nare being collected. For a more elaborate discussion of this\nhalo finder we refer the reader to Gill et al. (2004). We only\nlike to note at this point that MHF is essentially parameter\nfree and naturally finds halos with exactly the same accuracy as the simulation. Besides of the growth of the halo\nmass function and the abundance evolution of gravitationally bound objects, respectively, we confine our analysis to\nobjects identified at redshift z = 0. The investigation of the\nevolutionary history and hierarchical growth of structures\nwill be published elsewhere.\n\n4.2.1\n\nGlobal Properties\n\nIn Fig. 7 we show the evolution of the cumulative mass function n(> M ) of dark matter halos, i.e., the number of DM\nhalos with mass larger than M . The \u039bWDM model clearly\nhas less low\u2013mass objects as already pointed out by other authors (Knebe et al. 2002, Bode et al. 2001, Col\u0131\u0301n et al. 2000).\nAll three CDM models though perfectly agree at a redshift\nof z = 5, but there is a clear trend for the HAPPI models\nto give rise to more small mass halos, in agreement with the\nconclusion derived in the previous Section. This can be verified in Fig. 8, where we plot the number density evolution\nof objects more massive than M > 1010 h\u22121 M\u2299 (> 20 particles). In \u039bCDMhappi2 there are roughly 50% more halos\nabove our mass cut than in the reference \u039bCDM run.\nIn order to study the clustering properties of these halos\nwe estimated the two\u2013point correlation function for low\u2013 and\nhigh\u2013mass objects, respectively, as\n\n\f10\n\nKnebe A. et al.\n\nFigure 7. Cumulative mass function n(> M ) of DM halos.\n\nFigure 9. Two-point correlation function of objects more massive\n(upper panel) and less massive (lower panel) than 1012 h\u22121 M\u2299 .\n\nFigure 8. Number density evolution of objects more massive\nthan M > 1010 h\u22121 M\u2299 .\n\nstandard \u039bCDM and the two HAPPI models, however,\nemerges when we turn to the spin parameter distribution.\nThe spin parameter \u03bb was calculated using the definition\ngiven by Bullock et al. (2001a),\n\nN\n\ngal\nV X n\u03b1 (r; \u2206r)\n,\n\u03begal (r) = \u22121 + 2\nNgal\nv(r; \u2206r)\n\n(15)\n\n\u03b1=1\n\nwhere Ngal is the total number of objects in the simulation\nvolume V , and n\u03b1 (r; \u2206r) is the total number of objects in\na spherical shell of radius r and thickness \u2206r (and volume\nv(r; \u2206r)), centered at the \u03b1-th object. The result (along with\nPoisson error bars based upon the number of pairs in each\nbin) is shown in Fig. 9. The low\u2013mass objects show very\nsimilar clustering patterns, with a higher amplitude of \u03begal\nfor \u039bWDM and a marginally decreased correlation for the\n\u039bCDMhappi2 model. The situation though is difficult to\njudge at the high\u2013mass end as we have too few pairs per bin\nto make conclusive statements. The errors bars are larger\nthan the differences amongst the models and hence have\nbeen omitted. It seems, however, that the clustering pattern\nof high mass objects is similar in all models and does not\nshow differences when including the HAPPI correction term.\nThe most striking (and interesting) difference between\n\n\u03bb= \u221a\n\n|L|\n,\n2Mvir vvir rvir\n\n(16)\n\nwhere L is the angular momentum of the halo with respect\nto its center of mass, rvir is the virial radius of the halo, Mvir\nis the virialpmass (mass enclosed within the virial radius),\nand vvir = GMvir /rvir is the circular velocity at the virial\nradius. The virial radius and mass are determined by the\ncondition\nMvir =\n\n4\u03c0 3\nr \u033avir ,\n3 vir\n\n(17)\n\nwhere \u033avir = \u2206vir \u033ab (z = 0) is a fiducial density with \u2206vir \u2248\n340 (at redshift z = 0) based on the dissipationless spherical\ntop-hat collapse model for the cosmological parameters of\nthe \u039bCDM model. The probability distribution, P (\u03bb), of\nthe spin parameter was fitted to a log\u2013normal distribution\n(e.g. Frenk et al. 1988; Warren et al. 1992; Cole & Lacey\n1996; Maller, Dekel & Somerville 2002; Gardner 2001),\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fHydrodynamic Approch to Cosmic Structures\n\n11\n\nTable 2.

As we will see later on (cf. Fig. 13 in Section 4.2.2), there is a mass dependence of this result: lower\nmass halos tend to dominate the signal seen in Fig. 10. When\nplotting the mass\u2013weighted spin parameter distribution (not\nshown) the peaks for all four models approach each other.\nHowever, even then the HAPPI runs still show a distinct tail\nout to larger \u03bb values.\nThe HAPPI correction term also affects the concentration of dark matter halos. We define the concentration c1/5\nas the ratio of the virial radius rvir and the radius of the\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\nrvir\n.\nr1/5\n\n(19)\n\nIn view of the definition (17), it follows that the average\ndensity within a radius r1/5 is given by (1/5)c31/5 \u033avir . Fig. 11\nplots the cumulative probability distribution of the concentration of halos. We observe an obvious trend for an overabundance of low\u2013concentration halos in the \u039bWDM and\n\u039bCDMhappi2 models. However, the opposite actually holds\nfor \u039bCDMhappi1, where there appear to be of order 10%\nmore concentrated halos. The relative lack of power on scales\n\u22121\n<\n\u223c 1h Mpc noted in Fig. 4 for WDM and \u039bCDMhappi2 is\nrelated to the relatively lower concentration (and increased\nsmoothness for WDM) of the halos observed in these models\n(one must bear in mind that the halos have a virial radius\n\u22121\n<\n\u223c 800h kpc, see Fig. 16).\nAlthough not shown, we confirm that the scaling of the\nconcentration c1/5 , defined by Eq. (19), with mass Mvir\nfollows the same relation as the one proposed by Bullock et al. (2001b) for the \"NFW concentration\" of the halo,\ncNFW = rvir /rs (see Eq. (21) for the definition of rs ).\n\n4.2.2\n\nCross Correlations\n\nWhile the last Section dealt with the distribution of halo\nproperties, we now compare these properties across the models, i.e. how do these properties change in a given halo when\nmoving from one model to another?\n\n\f12\n\nKnebe A. et al.\n\nIn order to find corresponding halos across the four\nmodels, we compare their individual particle content. We\nstart with a halo in the \u039bCDM model, whose particles are\ntagged, and locate the corresponding halo in the other three\nmodels as the one that shares the largest number of tagged\nparticles. In the Figs. (12\u201314) we always plot the value of\nthe property under investigation in the \u039bCDM model, divided by the value of said property in the other model for\nall \"cross\u2013identified\" halos. These \"scatter-plots\" are always\naccompanied by histograms, where we average the ratios\npresented in the respective figure in nine bins across the actual mass range. The percentages of counterparts amount to\npractically 100% for the HAPPI models while there are only\n40% cross-identified halos in the \u039bWDM model. This number though increases to about 90% when we consider halos\n11 \u22121\ncontaining more than 200 particles (i.e., M >\nh M\u2299 ),\n\u223c 10\nand hence we set this as a lower limit in the cross\u2013correlation\nplots.\nWe start with the most obvious halo attribute, namely\nthe halo mass itself. Fig. 12 shows that there is a very tight\ncorrelation for the masses of individual halos, especially for\n\u039bCDM and \u039bCDMhappi1. The scatter about the 1:1 relation (the flat line of value 1) marginally increases from\n\u223c11% (averaged 1\u03c3-value) for \u039bCDMhappi1 to \u223c18% for\n\u039bCDMhappi2. At the high\u2013mass end, the \u039bCDMhappi2 halos tend to have a slightly larger mass. The most pronounced\ndifferences can be found for \u039bWDM though: at the low\u2013mass\nend the halos in \u039bWDM appear to be less massive than their\n\u039bCDM counter parts.\nIn the previous Section we showed that the HAPPI correction term lead to an increase in angular momentum by\ninvestigating the spin parameter distributions. But can we\nbe sure that the observed rise in \u03bb as defined by Eq. (16) is\nnot related to a possible decrease of virial radius rvir and/or\nvirial velocity vvir ? To clarify this uncertainty we show in\nFig. 13 the cross correlation of total specific angular momentum,\nJ=\n\n|L|\n.\nMvir\n\n(20)\n\nIn view of the already mentioned minimal scatter in the mass\nof cross-identified halos between the \u039bCDM model and the\nHAPPI models, Fig. 13 confirms the previous result that one\neffect of the term C in Eq. (7b) is to inject angular momentum to halos. We also note that there is a mass dependence\nin this trend: the differences in angular momentum are on\naverage larger for lower mass objects, this being particularly noticeable for the \u039bCDMhappi2 and \u039bWDM models;\nthis \"break\" roughly happens at around 1012 h\u22121 M\u2299 .\nWe close this Section with an investigation of the crosscorrelation of the concentration parameter c1/5 in Fig. 14.\nThe results are consistent with Fig. 11: \u039bCDMhappi1 halos\nare more concentrated than their \u039bCDM counterparts, while\nthe excess of low\u2013concentration halos for \u039bCDMhappi2 is\ndue to high\u2013mass halos. The mass trend already noted in\nFig. 13 can also be acknowledged in this figure.\nFinally, we mention as a general property that the dispersion in the scatter plots increases as the halo mass diminishes. We attribute most of this scatter to differences in the\nhalo's formation history, but a detailed study as function of\nredshift is required which we will postpone to a later paper.\n\nFigure 12. Ratio of halo masses for cross-identified objetcs. The\nvirial mass Mvir is given in units of h\u22121 M\u2299 . The histograms\nrepresent the mean ratio in the respective bin.\n\nMoreover, numerical effects could also contribute to some\nextent.\n\n4.2.3\n\nA Closer View of Individual Halos\n\nA visual representation of the two most massive halos in\nall four models is given in Fig. 15. This figure nicely demonstrates the result regarding the lower concentrations in (high\nmass) \u039bCDMhappi2 halos: the second most massive halo\ndoes not even show a distinct centre in \u039bCDMhappi2 and\nappears more \"puffy\" than in any of the other models.\nThe question now arises whether the density profiles of\nthe HAPPI models can still be fitted by the universal density\nprofile advocated by Navarro, Frenk & White (NFW, 1997)\n\u03c1(r) =\n\n\u03c1s rs3\n.\nr(rs + r)2\n\n(21)\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fHydrodynamic Approch to Cosmic Structures\n\nFigure 13. Ratio of specific angular momenta.\n\nFigure 14. Ratio of halo concentrations c1/5 .\n\nFig. 16 now shows \u03c1(r) and the corresponding best fits to\nNFW profiles for a selection of halos covering the mass range\nfrom the most massive one (upper left) to rather light halos\n(lower right) containing a mere 300 particles. For (nearly)\nall \u039bCDMhappi2 halos we observe a relative flattening in\nthe central regions.\nIn order to gauge the quality of the fits (for the 16\npresented sample profiles) we calculate the \u03c72 value defined\nas\n\u03c72 =\n\n1\nNbins\n\nNbins\n\nX \u03c1i \u2212 \u03c1NFW (ri )\ni=1\n\n2\n\n\u03c1NFW (ri )\n\n,\n\n(22)\n\nwhere \u03c1i are the binned density profiles derived from the\nsimulation data and \u03c1NFW the best\u2013fit NFW profiles. This\nanalysis then indicates that all four models are equally well\nfit by Eq. (21) with \u03c72 varying in the range \u03c72 \u223c 0.02 \u2212 0.05\ndepending on the weighing scheme applied for each individual bin. This entails that the dark matter halos of the\nc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n13\n\nHAPPI runs still exhibit the rather infamous \"cusp\" at the\ncenter.\nWe remind the reader again that the force resolution\nthroughout the runs varies. Whereas \u039bCDM, \u039bCDMhappi1,\nand \u039bWDM reached 2.5h\u22121 kpc resolution, \u039bCDMhappi2\nreliably resolves structures only on scales larger than\n10h\u22121 kpc. Moreover, the resolution can also change from\nhalo to halo due to the adaptive mesh nature of both the\nhalo finder and the N -body code: not all halo centres lie on\nthe finest grid level reached in the simulation. However, we\nplot profiles starting from the distance rmin that corresponds\nto a sphere containing at least 10 particles (and hence rmin\ncan be actually smaller than the nominal resolution of the\nsimulation).\nFor the same set of halos we present in Fig. 17 the\nrotation curves out to half the respective virial radius. The\nrotational velocity vcirc (r) is defined as\n\n\f14\n\nKnebe A. et al.\ntion values at a given radius are substantially smaller than\nin \u039bCDM. However, this difference becomes less prominent\nin lower mass systems and the flat part of the rotation\ncurve nearly reaches the same level as \u039bCDM. This discrepancy in the trends between \u039bCDMhappi1 and \u039bCDMhappi2\nfor high\u2013mass halos is likely related to the also opposite\ntrends concerning the concentration, Figs. 11 and 14, and\nthe small\u2013scale power, Fig. 4.\n\n5\n\nFigure 15.

While the maximum is still at comparable distances\nin \u039bCDM and \u039bCDMhappi1, the latter shows a steeper inner increase and a subsequent faster decline to nearly the\nsame level in the \"outer\" parts. Moreover, the \u039bCDMhappi1\nrotation curves are always slightly above the corresponding\n\u039bCDM curves.

This approach is\nnovel in that it deals with the mass density and velocity\nfields with explicit account of the coarse-grained nature intrinsic to any approach of solving, for instance, Poisson's\nequation via Monte Carlo sampling of phase-space. This N body approach unavoidably introduces finite resolution effects and there have been systematic studies of the consequences in the context of cosmological structure formation\n(Kuhlman, Melott & Shandarin 1996; Splinter et al. 1998;\nMoore et al. 1998; Knebe et al. 2000; Power et al. 2003). N body simulations invariably neglect the dynamical effect of\nsub\u2013resolution degrees of freedom altogether. For the first\ntime we have run simulations including a physical model\nof the coupling to the neglected scales. N -body codes are\nusually viewed as integrators of the Vlasov\u2013Poisson system\nof equations. However, we have argued how grid\u2013based N body codes such as MLAPM can be reinterpreted to integrate\nhydrodynamic\u2013like equations for the mass density and velocity fields.\nThe additional, correction term introduced in the hydrodynamic approach is proportional to a \"coupling constant\" B which depends on the smoothing window used to\ncalculate the coarse-grained fields. It is found to be B = 1/4\nfor the triangular\u2013shaped\u2013cloud window used throughout\nthe N -body code MLAPM. In order to get a better understanding of the effects of the correction term onto the evolution\nof cosmic structures we also performed a simulation with\na higher value B = 1 - this later model is not physically\nmotivated but rather serves as an \"academic toy model\" for\ncomparison. The standard \u039bCDM simulation can be understood as another HAPPI run with the value B = 0. In order\nto allow for a better comparison with other feasible alternatives to the concordance \u039bCDM model as well as to better\ngauge the influence of the correction term, we also simulated\nthe evolution of the same structures in a \u039bWDM universe.\nIn this work we concentrated on the comparison of the\nfour simulations at redshift z = 0. We analyzed the resulting\nstructures in two complementary manners: global properties\nof the mass density and velocity fields, on the one hand, and\nspecific properties of DM halos, on the other hand. We find\nappreciable differences between the B 6= 0 runs and the reference (B = 0) \u039bCDM run, even though the force due to\nthe correction terms are for most particles one or even two\norders of magnitude smaller than the total force (cf. Fig. 2).\nMost remarkably, the correction term favors the proliferation of low\u2013mass halos, giving the mass distribution a more\n\"grainy\" aspect, as well as the gain of angular momentum\nspecially by low\u2013mass halos, which also shows up in a vec 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\n\fHydrodynamic Approch to Cosmic Structures\n\n15\n\nFigure 16.

The vertical lines to the right indicate the respective virial radius while the two vertical lines to the left indicate the spatial\nresolution of the \u039bCDM, \u039bCDMhappi1, \u039bWDM (dashed) and \u039bCDMhappi2 (dotted) run, respectively.\n\nlocity field with a larger vorticity. These effects are quantitatively larger as the value of B increases; for B = 1/4 the\ndifferences lie at the (10 \u2212 20)% level (and even higher for\nthe specific angular momentum at low masses). A feature\nin which the B = 1/4 and B = 1 runs exhibit an opposite\ntrend with respect to the B = 0 run is the concentration of\nhigh\u2013mass halos: the B = 1 run results in an overabundance\nof high\u2013mass halos with a lower concentration This is paralleled by a smaller circular velocity of these halos, and by\nthe relative lack of power in the spectrum of density fluctuations at sufficiently small scales, so that the maximum\ndensity reached in the B = 1 run is much smaller than in\nthe other runs. The B = 1/4 run, however, shows precisely\nthe opposite tendency with respect to the reference run. One\ncan conjecture that this discrepancy between the B = 1/4\nand B = 1 runs lies in a difference in the rate of shear and\nvorticity generation and of kinetic energy drainage by the\ncorrection term. A comparative study of the structures at\ndifferent redshifts is required in order to obtain more precise\nconclusions about this issue.\nThe relatively small quantitative differences between\nthe B = 1/4 and the B = 0 runs evidenced in the propc 0000 RAS, MNRAS 000, 000\u2013000\n\nerties that we have measured suggest that the B = 1/4\ncorrection term could be considered a small perturbation to\nthe B = 0 evolution. By contrast, the results of the B = 1\nrun indicate that the correction term should not be treated\nas a perturbation in this case.\nOur results agree with the theoretical expectation for\nthe qualitative behavior of the correction term, which models the effect of small\u2013scale tidal torques and shear stresses\n(Dom\u0131\u0301nguez 2000, 2002; Buchert & Dom\u0131\u0301nguez 2005). We\nobserved that the correction term is dominant preferentially\nin walls at high redshifts, and later on in filaments, regions of\nmass accretion onto halos, halo centers as well as in regions\nof particular dynamical activity (e.g., mergers), that is, regions of large gradients in the fields, in concordance with the\nform of the correction term (8). The term is expected to act\nas a drain of kinetic energy in collapsing regions: this can\nexplain the formation of small clusters of particles, which\nwould otherwise fly by each other - instead, they can be\ngravitationally confined by a potential well that is lower than\nin the B = 0 model. This could explain the low mass halo\nproliferation for B = 1/4 or B = 1, as well as the observed\ntendency of halos to attain a slightly more concentrated con-\n\n\f16\n\nKnebe A. et al.\n\nFigure 17. Rotation curves for the same halos as in Fig. 16.\n\nfiguration in the case of B = 1/4, when the correction term\ncan be considered a small perturbation. If B = 1, on the\nother hand, the loss of kinetic energy is apparently so important that, in some cases of halos in regions of high dynamical activity, dynamical relaxation and coalescence are\nslowed down noticeably, leading to a multiple-core structure. These not completely relaxed halos would then have\na lower concentration and a lower mass than their LCDM\ncounterparts, similarly to the simulation results.\nWe further confirmed explicitly that the correction term\nacts as a source of vorticity. This relates directly to the gain\nin angular momentum of halos, which tends to increase with\ngrowing value of B, especially at the low\u2013mass end of the\nhalo distribution.\nFinally, we remark that our findings agree qualitatively\nwith conclusions following from a comparative study of identical initial conditions evolved at different resolutions. We\nhave run a series of test simulations where we either switched\non the HAPPI correction term or increased the actual force\nresolution; both methods lead to comparable results that\nare in qualitative agreement with the conclusions presented\nhere. For a more quantitative analysis we though refer the\nreader to a future paper in preparation where we will investigate the relationship between HAPPI simulations and\n\nhigher-resolution ones in more detail. The proliferation of\nsmall halos with increasing resolution has also been reported\nby other authors in and around (massive) halos (Klypin et\nal. 1999, Moore et al. 1998) as well as in voids (Gottl\u00f6ber\net al. 2003). Concerning the generation of angular momentum though, the relevance for the formation of realistic disk\ngalaxies has yet to be determined but there are clear indications that this task requires good mass and force resolution\n(Governato et al. 2004). In conclusion, the HAPPI implementation seems indeed to be qualitatively consistent with\nwhat one expects from higher resolution simulations and\nhence may provide a framework for a better understanding\nof resolution effects in N -body simulations. However, further\nwork is required to substantiate this possibility.\n\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nAK acknowledges funding through the Emmy Noether Programme by the DFG (KN 755/1).

In particular, when V (t) = Vbox , this\nsurface integral vanishes by periodic boundary conditions\nand, since the contribution by wmf also vanishes in this case,\nEq.
