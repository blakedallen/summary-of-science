These results are an unexpected, if hardly\nunique, example of linearization instability.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Bel-Robinson tensor B\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 was first discovered in ordinary Einstein gravity (GR) at D = 4,\nin a search for a gravitational counterpart of the usual matter stress-tensor T\u03bc\u03bd . Since there can\nbe neither local tensorial gravitational candidates of second derivative order (because quantities\n\u223c \u2202g\u03bc\u03bd \u2202g\u03b1\u03b2 , being frame-dependent, can be made to vanish at any point), nor any non-covariantly\nconserved ones, the successful candidate was indeed quadratic in the tensorial \"field strengths\" \u2013\ncurvatures B \u223c RR, and covariantly conserved, in analogy with the quadratic Maxwell T\u03bc\u03bd \u223c F F .\nSubsequently, conserved B were found for arbitrary dimension and matter analogs have also been\nconstructed (see, e.g., [1] for earlier references).\nVery recently, we showed that a conserved B \u223c R DR could be defined for topologically\nmassive gravity [2]. Given this theory's third derivative order, we speculated there on extending B\n1\n\n\fto other gravitational systems, in particular to the currently popular quadratic curvature models.\nThe present note reports a negative outcome in two active, very different theories. For the fourth\nderivative D = 3 new massive gravity (NMG) [3], without an Einstein term [4] for simplicity,\nthere is a B \u223c \u2202R\u2202R at linearized level but it cannot be extended to the full theory, despite\nan enormous number of possible cubic correction terms. The Lanczos-Lovelock (LL) [5] models'\nquadratic curvature field equations, \u223c RR = 0, obviously cannot even be linearized about flat\nspace and turn out to have no conserved B either. Adding cosmological or Einstein terms to\npermit linearization (to effective cosmological GR) about the resulting dS vacua only allows the\nusual linear B \u223c RR of GR, but no nonlinear extension.\n\n2\n\nFourth Order Models\n\nSince the machinery is considerably more complicated here than in GR, we analyze the (purely\nquadratic part of) NMG [3]:\nZ\n\u0001\n\u221a\n1\nR\u0304\u03bc\u03bd \u2261 R\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 g\u03bc\u03bd R.\n(1)\nI = d3 x \u2212g R\u0304\u03bc\u03bd R\u0304\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 R\u03042 ,\n4\n[The Cotton tensor of TMG is the curl of the Schouten tensor R\u0304\u03bc\u03bd .] The resulting field equations,\n\u0003R\u0304\u03bc\u03bd \u2212 D\u03bc D\u03bd R\u0304 \u2212 4 R\u0304\u03bc\u03c3 R\u0304\u03bd\u03c3 + R\u0304 R\u0304\u03bc\u03bd + g\u03bc\u03bd R\u03042 = 0\n\n(2)\n\nof course obey Bianchi identities since (1) is an invariant. The field equations begin as DD R\u0304 \u223c 0,\nso B cannot just imitate the RR of GR, but must instead start as B \u223c D R\u0304 D R\u0304, along with possible\ncubic, R\u0304R\u0304R\u0304, terms since they have the same dimension as D R\u0304 D R\u0304. Schematically then, we expect\nthat\nB \u223c D R\u0304 D R\u0304 + R\u0304R\u0304R\u0304.\n(3)\n[One can also consider similar terms \u223c D(R\u0304D R\u0304) or R\u0304DD R\u0304, but they are already irrelevant at\nlinear level.] We begin with the linearized (about flat space) truncation, \u2202\u2202 R\u0304 = 0, of (2); the\ncorresponding linearized B is simply given by\n\u0001\nB\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 = R\u0304\u03b1\u03b2,\u03c3 R\u0304\u03c3\u03bd,\u03bc \u2212 R\u0304\u03bc\u03bd,\u03c3 .\n(4)\nIts conservation,\n\n\u2202 \u03bc B\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 = 0\n\n(5)\n\nis verified using the field equations, the Bianchi identity, and antisymmetry of the parenthesis in\n(4). Conservation also holds for all permutations of B's (\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2) indices; for completeness, we note\nalso the identically conserved, if irrelevant, b\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 = D \u03b3 H[\u03b3\u03bc]\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 , H antisymmetric in \u03b3 \u2194 \u03bc.\nThus encouraged, we turn to candidates (3) at nonlinear level, where the now covariant\nderivatives D\u03bc no longer commute. At first sight, there are so many available independent terms\ncubic in R\u0304\u03bc\u03bd and g\u03bc\u03bd R\u0304, that success seems guaranteed; however, it turns out to be unattainable.\nThe simplest procedure is to take the covariant divergence of the initial B \u223c D R\u0304 (D R\u0304 \u2212 D R\u0304) ansatz\nand try to compensate for the resulting cubic \u223c R\u0304R\u0304 D R\u0304 terms by adding suitable R\u0304R\u0304R\u0304 to B. The\n\n2\n\n\fprocedure is straightforward, using the D = 3 properties\nR\u03bc\u03bd\u03c1\u03c3 = g\u03bc\u03c1 R\u0304\u03bd\u03c3 + g\u03bd\u03c3 R\u0304\u03bc\u03c1 \u2212 g\u03bd\u03c1 R\u0304\u03bc\u03c3 \u2212 g\u03bc\u03c3 R\u0304\u03bd\u03c1 ,\ni\nh\n[D\u03b1 , D\u03b2 ] V \u03b3 = \u03b4\u03b2\u03b3 R\u0304\u03c3\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b4\u03b1\u03b3 R\u0304\u03c3\u03b2 + g\u03c3\u03b1 R\u0304\u03b3\u03b2 \u2212 g\u03c3\u03b2 R\u0304\u03b3\u03b1 V \u03c3 .\n\n(6)\n\nWe find\n\u03bc\n\n\u0014\n\nD B\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 = R\u0304\n\n\u03c1\u03bc\n\nR\u0304\u03c1\u03b2 R\u0304\u03bc\u03bd;\u03b1 \u2212 R\u0304\u03b1\u03bd;\u03bc\n\n\u0001\n\n\u0015\n\u0001\n1\n\u03c3\u03c1\n\u03c3\n+ R\u0304\u03b1\u03b2;\u03c3 R\u0304 R\u0304\u03c1\u03bd \u2212 R\u0304 \u03bd R\u0304 + (\u03b1 \u2194 \u03b2) ,\n2\n\n(7)\n\nto which could be added the above (\u03b1\u03b2\u03bd) permutations. The problem is now to find, among all\n(R\u0304 R\u0304 R\u0304)\u03bc\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 , those whose \u03bc-divergence cancels (7), or the sum of permutations. Note that (7)\ncontains both \u03bc- and \u03b1 , \u03b2-derivatives, and that the latter must arise from cubic terms of the form\n\u223c g\u03bc\u03b1 (R\u0304 R\u0304 R\u0304)\u03bd\u03b2 , and possibly g\u03bc\u03b1 g\u03bd\u03b2 (R\u0304 R\u0304 R\u0304); these are also plentiful. This systematic approach\nfailed: any compensating term also created a new problematic one. We then undertook the brute\nforce approach, involving the sum of all dimensionally possible candidate terms, \u223c D R\u0304 D R\u0304 +\nR\u0304 DD R\u0304 + R\u0304R\u0304R\u0304; to be sure, any D R\u0304 D R\u0304 combinations that fail the linearized conservation test\ncould be excluded a priori.\nWe sketch the procedure and counts, but omit the uninstructive, laborious, details1 . Start\nwith the thirty nine possible terms of the form R\u0304R\u0304R\u0304, incuding g R\u0304R\u0304R\u0304 terms, together with the 75\nD(R\u0304 D R\u0304) candidates, giving a total of m = 114 potential terms. Take the divergence of each of\nthese, enforcing the on-shell, Bianchi and three-dimensional simplifications. That gives, for each\nterm, a right-hand side that is a linear combination of (DD R\u0304) D R\u0304, R\u0304R\u0304D R\u0304 and R\u0304 DDD R\u0304. There\nare n = 231 unique terms of this form in these sums. We can view the action of D \u03bc as a linear\noperator taking the m starting ingredients to a space of n outputs: assign to each candidate term\na basis vector {ei }m\nin the sums D \u03bc ei , the basis vector {Ei }ni=1 , the\ni=1 , and to each term appearing P\nn\u00d7m\nmatrix D \u2208 R\njust maps ek to its sum: D ek = ni=1 \u03b1i Ei . We constructed this matrix using a\nsymbolic algebra package, and found that D has no null space, and so no conserved Bel-Robinson\ntensor exists.\n\n3\n\nSecond Order, LL, Theories\n\nAt the other end of the quadratic curvature spectrum from the D = 3 model (1) lie the D > 4 LL\ntheories, whose field equations remain of second derivative order, but do not admit any linearized\nexpansion about flat space. The Lagrangians are, in vielbein formulation,\nL = \u01ebabcdf ... \u01ebABCDF ... RabAB RcdCD ef F . . .\n\n(8)\n\nThe field equations simply consist of removing one vielbein factor,\nE f F \u2261 (\u01eb\u01eb RR e)f F = 0,\n1\n\nThese may be found in the notebook at: http://people.reed.edu/\u223cjfrankli/NullSpace.nb.\n\n3\n\n(9)\n\n\fsince the curvatures' variations vanish by the cyclic identities. Lowercase indices are local, capitals\nare world. Diffeomorphism invariance of the action ensures that DF E f F vanishes identically, by\nthe cyclic identities. Indeed, this is even true in D > 5: if we open any second pair of indices (gG),\nthere results an identically conserved, hence uninteresting, H f g...F G.... We cannot even start with\na linearized B, since the field equations (9) are intrinsically nonlinear. That there is no true B is\nrather clear: for example, attaching a curvature to H above loses conservation, which no additional\ncubics can help, while no DR DR term is relevant just because it is linearizable. Extending LL to\ninclude a cosmological or Einstein term does allow for linearization about a nonflat, dS, vacuum:\na dS metric ansatz reduces (9) to the equation \u223c a \u039b2 = b \u039b in either choice. There is always\na flat, \u039b = 0, but also now a dS, \u039b = b/a, vacuum2 . About the latter, the system linearizes to\ncosmological Einstein, which of course enjoys the same conserved B \u223c RR as \u039b = 0 GR. However,\njust like its predecessor in NMG, this B evaporates as soon as we go to the full theory, since there\nis still no way to take into account the nonlinear RR part of (9).\n\n4\n\nConclusion\n\nWe conclude that both NMG and Einstein+LL violate Fermi's rule: if the lowest order works, the\nconjecture is correct, while pure LL doesn't even have a lowest (here linearized) order.
