Introduction\nWhile analytic vectors are basic objects in the representation theory of real Lie groups, a coherent framework to study general analytic\nrepresentations has been lacking so far. It is the aim of this article to\nintroduce categories of tempered and non\u2013tempered such representations and to analyze their fundamental properties. For a representation\n(\u03c0, E) of a Lie group G on a locally convex space E to be analytic, we\nare going to require that every vector in E be analytic and that the\ntopology on the space of analytic vectors coincide with the topology\nof E. No completeness assumptions on E are imposed, so that the\nquotient of an analytic representation by a closed invariant subspace is\nagain analytic.\nRecall that a vector v \u2208 E is called analytic provided that the orbit\nmap \u03b3v : x 7\u2192 \u03c0(x)v extends to a holomorphic E\u2013valued function in\na neighborhood of G within the complexification GC . The space E \u03c9\nof analytic vectors carries a natural inductive limit topology E \u03c9 =\nlimn\u2192\u221e En ,\nEn = {v \u2208 E | \u03b3v extends to a holomorphic map GVn \u2192 E} ,\nindexed by a neighborhood basis {Vn }n\u2208N of the identity in GC . The\ninduced representation (\u03c0, E \u03c9 ) turns out to be continuous and indeed\nsatisfies E \u03c9 = (E \u03c9 )\u03c9 in the sense of topological vector spaces. Every\nanalytic representation is obtained in this way. Due to the inductive\nlimit structure of E \u03c9 , interesting examples tend to involve complicated\nand possibly incomplete topologies. For instance, infinite dimensional\nFr\u00e9chet spaces do not carry any irreducible analytic representations of a\nreductive group. Still, in spite of examples by Grothendieck and others\nwhich show how incomplete spaces may naturally occur, important\nspecial cases are better behaved, like for instance the analytic vectors\nassociated to a Banach representation, the algebra A(G) below, or the\nanalytic globalization of a Harish\u2013Chandra module.\nModerately growing analytic representations allow for an additional\naction by an algebra of superexponentially decaying functions. To be\nspecific, consider a Banach representation (\u03c0, E). Fix a left\u2013invariant\nRiemannian metric on G and let d be the associated distance function.\nThe continuous functions on G decaying faster than e\u2212nd(*,1) for all\nn \u2208 N form a convolution algebra R(G), which is a G\u2013module under the\nleft regular representation. If we denote the space of analytic vectors\nof R(G) by A(G), the map\nZ\n\u03c9\n(1.1)\n\u03a0 : A(G) \u2192 End(E ), \u03a0(f )v =\nf (x) \u03c0(x)v dx ,\nG\n\n\fANALYTIC REPRESENTATIONS\n\n3\n\ngives rise to a continuous algebra action on E \u03c9 . More general representations will be called A(G)\u2013tempered, or of moderate growth, provided\nthat the integral in (1.1) converges and defines a continuous action of\nA(G).\nLet us now specify to the case where G is a real reductive group,\nand let us recall that to each admissible G-representation E of finite\nlength one can associate the Harish-Chandra module EK of its K-finite\nvectors. Conversely, a globalization of a given Harish-Chandra module\nV is an admissible representation of G with V = EK . The main result\nfor this case is now as follows:\nTheorem 1.1. Let G be a real reductive group. Then every HarishChandra module V for G admits a unique A(G)-tempered analytic globalization V min . Moreover, V min has the property V min = \u03a0(A(G))V.\nIt follows that E \u03c9 \u2243 V min for every A(G)-tempered globalization E\nof V (in particular, for every Banach globalization). Let us mention the\nrelationship to the announcements of Schmid and of Kashiwara-Schmid\nin [21] and [15], which (among others) assert that every Harish-Chandra\nmodule admits a unique minimal globalization, which is equivalent to\nE \u03c9 for all Banach globalizations E. Our proof of Theorem 1.1 is independent of this theory. Instead, we rely on the corresponding theory\nby Casselman and Wallach for smooth globalizations, which is documented in [22] and more recently in [1].\nThe theorem features a worthwhile corollary, namely:\nCorollary 1.2. For an irreducible admissible Banach representation\n(\u03c0, E) of a real reductive group G, the space of analytic vectors E \u03c9 is\nan algebraically simple A(G)-module.\n\n2. Banach representations and F-representations\nAll topological vector spaces E considered in this paper are assumed\nto be Hausdorff and locally convex. If E is a topological vector space,\nthen we denote by GL(E) the group of isomorphisms of E.\nLet G be a connected Lie group. By a representation of G we shall\nunderstand a continuous action\nG \u00d7 E \u2192 E, (g, v) 7\u2192 g * v ,\non some topological vector space E. Each representation gives rise to\na group homomorphism\n\u03c0 : G \u2192 E, g 7\u2192 \u03c0(g), \u03c0(g)v := g * v\n\n(v \u2208 E) ,\n\nand it is custom to denote the representation by the symbol (\u03c0, E).\n\n\f4\n\nGIMPERLEIN, KR\u00d6TZ, AND SCHLICHTKRULL\n\nA representation (\u03c0, E) is called a Banach representation if E is a\nBanach space. We say that (\u03c0, E) is an F-representation, if E is a\nFr\u00e9chet space for which there exists a defining family of seminorms\n(pn )n\u2208N such that for all n \u2208 N the action\nG \u00d7 (E, pn ) \u2192 (E, pn )\nis continuous. Here (E, pn ) refers to the vector space E endowed with\nthe locally convex structure induced by pn .\nRemark 2.1. (a) Every Banach representation is an F-representation.\n(b) Let (\u03c0, E) be an F-representation. For each n \u2208 N let us denote\nby \u00can the Banach completion of (E, pn ), i.e. the completion of the\nnormed space E/{pn = 0}. The action of G on (E, pn ) factors to a\ncontinuous action on the normed space E/{pn = 0} and thus induces\na Banach representation of G on \u00can .\n(c) The left regular action of G on the Fr\u00e9chet space C(G) defines a\nrepresentation, but in general not an F-representation.\nLet E \u221e denote the space of smooth vectors in E, that is, the vectors\nv \u2208 E for which the orbit map g 7\u2192 \u03c0(g)v is smooth into E. Then\nE \u221e \u2282 E is an invariant subspace, and it is dense if E is complete. The\norbit map provides an injection of E \u221e into C \u221e (G, E), from which E \u221e\ninherits a topological vector space structure. Then (\u03c0, E \u221e ) is a representation. Furthermore, E \u221e is a Fr\u00e9chet space if E is a Fr\u00e9chet space,\nand (\u03c0, E \u221e ) is an F-representation if (\u03c0, E) is an F-representation.\nBy definition, a smooth representation is a representation for which\nE \u221e = E as topological vector spaces.\n2.1. Growth of representations\nWe call a function w : G \u2192 R+ a weight if\n\u2022 w is locally bounded,\n\u2022 w is sub-multiplicative, i.e. if\nw(gh) \u2264 w(g)w(h)\nfor all g, h \u2208 G.\nTo every Banach representation (\u03c0, E) we associate the function\nw\u03c0 (g) := k\u03c0(g)k\n\n(g \u2208 G) ,\n\nwhere k * k denotes the standard operator norm. It follows from the\nuniform boundedness principle that w\u03c0 is locally bounded. Hence w\u03c0\nis a weight.\n\n\fANALYTIC REPRESENTATIONS\n\n5\n\nSub-multiplicative functions can be dominated in a geometric way.\nFor that let us fix a left invariant Riemannian metric g on G. Associated to g we obtain the Riemannian distance function d : G\u00d7G \u2192 R\u22650 .\nThe distance function is left G-invariant and hence is recovered as\nd(g, h) = d(g \u22121h) from the function\nd(g) := d(g, 1)\n\n(g \u2208 G),\n\nwhere 1 \u2208 G is the neutral element. Notice that it follows from the\nelementary properties of the metric that d is compatible with the group\nstructure in the sense that\n(2.1)\n\nd(g \u22121 ) = d(g) and d(gh) \u2264 d(g) + d(h)\n\nfor all g, h \u2208 G. In particular, g 7\u2192 ed(g) is a weight. Note also that the\nmetric balls {g \u2208 G| d(g) \u2264 R} in G are compact ([5], p. 74).\nIf w is an arbitrary weight on G, then there exist constants c, C > 0\n(depending on w) such that\n(2.2)\n\nw(g) \u2264 Cecd(g)\n\n(g \u2208 G),\n\n([5], p. 75, Lemme 3). In particular, it follows that a Banach representation has at most exponential growth\nk\u03c0(g)k \u2264 Cec d(g) .\nBy applying Remark 2.1(b) we obtain for an F-representation (\u03c0, E)\nwith defining seminorms (pn )n\u2208N that for each n there exist constants\ncn , Cn such that\n(2.3)\n\npn (\u03c0(g)v) \u2264 Cn ecn d(g) pn (v)\n\n(g \u2208 G, v \u2208 E).\n\nFinally, notice that it follows from (2.2) that if d1 (g) = dg1 (g, 1) is\nthe function associated with a different choice of a G-invariant metric,\nthen d1 is compatible with d, in the sense that there exist constants\nc, C > 0 such that\nd1 (g) \u2264 cd(g) + C\n\n(g \u2208 G)\n\n(and vice\u2013versa with d, d1 interchanged).\nRemark 2.2. Suppose that G is a real reductive group and k * k is a\nnorm of G (see [22], Sect 2.A.2). Then k * k is a weight and hence there\nexist constants c1 , C1 > 0 such that\nlog kgk \u2264 c1 d(g) + C1\n\n(g \u2208 G).\n\nConversely, by following the proof of [22], Lemma 2.A.2.2, one finds\nconstants c2 , C2 > 0 such that\nd(g) \u2264 c2 log kgk + C2\n\n(g \u2208 G).\n\n\f6\n\nGIMPERLEIN, KR\u00d6TZ, AND SCHLICHTKRULL\n\n3. Analytic representations\nLet us start by setting up some notations in order to discuss the\nissue of analyticity in a convenient way.\nLet us denote by g the Lie algebra of G. To simplify the exposition\nwe will assume that G \u2282 GC , where GC is a complex group with Liealgebra g \u2297R C =: gC . We stress, however, that this assumption is not\nnecessary, since the use of GC essentially only takes place locally in\nneighborhoods G.\nWe extend the left invariant metric g to a left GC -invariant metric\non GC and denote the associated distance function as before by d. For\nevery n \u2208 N we set\n1\n}\nand\nUn := Vn \u2229 G .\nn\nIt is clear that the Vn 's, resp. Un 's, form a base of the neighborhood\nfilter of 1 in GC , resp. G. Note that Vn is symmetric, and that xy \u2208 Vn\nfor all x, y \u2208 V2n .\nVn := {g \u2208 GC | d(g) <\n\n3.1. The space of analytic vectors\nLet (\u03c0, E) be a representation of G. For each v \u2208 E we denote by\n\u03b3v : G \u2192 E, x 7\u2192 \u03c0(x)v ,\nthe associated continuous orbit map. We call v an analytic vector if \u03b3v\nextends to a holomorphic E-valued function (see Section 6) on some\nopen neighborhood of G in GC .\nIf v is analytic, then \u03b3v is a real analytic map G \u2192 E. The converse\nstatement, that real analyticity of the orbit map implies the analyticity\nof v, holds under the assumption that E is sequentially complete. Hence\nour definition agrees with the standard notion of analytic vectors for\nBanach representations, see for example [19], [5], [8].\nRemark 3.1. If E is a Banach space or more generally a complete\nDF-space (see [18], Ch. 25), then it follows from [20] Thm. 1, that v is\nan analytic vector already if the orbit map is weakly analytic, that is,\n\u03bb \u25e6 \u03b3v : G \u2192 C is real analytic for all \u03bb \u2208 E \u2032 . Here E \u2032 denotes the dual\nspace of continuous linear forms.\nThe space of analytic vectors is denoted by E \u03c9 . A theorem of Nelson ([19] p. 599) asserts that E \u03c9 is dense in E if E is a Banach space.\nMore precisely, Nelson's theorem asserts the following. Let ht \u2208 C \u221e (G)\ndenote the heat kernel on G, where t > 0, then \u03a0(ht )v \u2208 E \u03c9 and\n\n\fANALYTIC REPRESENTATIONS\n\n7\n\n\u03a0(ht )v \u2192 v for t \u2192 0, for all v \u2208 E. In fact, the proof of Nelson's theorem is valid more generally if E is sequentially complete and\nwith suitably restricted growth of \u03c0. In particular, this is the case for\nF-representations, see (2.3). The density is false in general, as easy\nexamples such as the left regular representation of R on Cc (R) show.\nWe wish to emphasize that E \u03c9 is a G-invariant vector subspace of\nE. This follows immediately from the identity \u03b3\u03c0(g)v (x) = \u03b3v (xg). We\nalso note that E \u03c9 is a g-invariant subset of the space E \u221e of smooth\nvectors.\nIt is convenient to introduce the following notation. For every n \u2208 N\nwe define the subspace of E \u03c9 ,\nEn = {v \u2208 E | \u03b3v extends to a holomorphic map GVn \u2192 E}.\nSince G is totally real in GC and GVn is connected, the holomorphic\nextension of \u03b3v is unique if it exists. Let us denote the extension by\n\u03b3v,n \u2208 O(GVn , E). For each z \u2208 GVn the operator\n\u03c0n (z) : En \u2192 E,\n\n\u03c0n (z)v := \u03b3v,n (z),\n\nis linear. In particular, uniqueness implies\n\u03c0n (gz) = \u03c0(g)\u03c0n (z)\nfor all g \u2208 G, z \u2208 GVn . It is easily seen that if m < n, then Em \u2282 En\nand \u03c0m (z)v = \u03c0n (z)v for z \u2208 GVn , v \u2208 Em . We shall omit the subscript\nn from the operator \u03c0n (z) if no confusion is possible.\nA closely related space is\n\u1ebcn = {v \u2208 E | \u03b3v |Un extends holomorphically to Vn }.\nLemma 3.2. The space of analytic vectors is given by the increasing\nunions\n[\n[\nE\u03c9 =\nEn =\n\u1ebcn .\nn\u2208N\n\nn\u2208N\n\nFurthermore,\n(3.1)\n\nEn \u2282 \u1ebcn \u2282 E4n\n\nfor all n \u2208 N.\nProof. The inclusions\n\n[\n\nn\u2208N\n\nEn \u2282 E \u03c9 \u2282\n\n[\n\n\u1ebcn ,\n\nn\u2208N\n\nas well as the first inclusion in (3.1), are clear. Hence it suffices to\nprove the second inclusion in (3.1). Let v \u2208 Vn and let us denote the\nextension of \u03b3v by f : Vn \u2192 E. For g \u2208 G and z \u2208 V4n we define\nF (gz) := \u03c0(g)f (z) \u2208 E.\n\n\f8\n\nGIMPERLEIN, KR\u00d6TZ, AND SCHLICHTKRULL\n\nWe need to show that the expression is well-defined. Assume gz =\ng \u2032z \u2032 with g, g \u2032 \u2208 G and z, z \u2032 \u2208 V4n . Then g \u22121g \u2032 = zz \u2032\u22121 \u2208 V2n , and\nhence g \u22121g \u2032 x \u2208 Vn for all x \u2208 V2n . Since \u03c0(g)\u03c0(g \u22121g \u2032x)v = \u03c0(g \u2032 )\u03c0(x)v\nfor x \u2208 G, analytic continuation from U2n implies \u03c0(g)f (g \u22121g \u2032 x) =\n\u03c0(g \u2032)f (x) for x \u2208 V2n . In particular, with x = z \u2032 we obtain \u03c0(g)f (z) =\n\u03c0(g \u2032)f (z \u2032 ), showing that F is well defined. As F is clearly holomorphic,\nwe conclude that v \u2208 E4n .\n\u0003\nNext we want to topologize E \u03c9 . For that we notice that the holomorphic extensions provide injections of En and \u1ebcn into O(GVn , E) and\nO(Vn , E), respectively. We topologize En and \u1ebcn by means of these\nmaps and the standard compact open topologies. It is easily seen that\nthe inclusion maps En \u2192 En+1 \u2192 E and \u1ebcn \u2192 \u1ebcn+1 \u2192 E are all\ncontinuous. Furthermore:\nLemma 3.3. The inclusion maps in (3.1) are continuous for all n \u2208 N.\nProof. Identifying En and \u1ebcn with the corresponding spaces of holomorphic functions, we obtain the following neighborhood bases of 0. In\nEn , the members are all sets\nWK,Z := {f \u2208 En | f (K) \u2282 Z},\nwhere K \u2282 GVn is compact and Z \u2282 E a zero neighborhood. Similarly\nin \u1ebcn , members are\nW\u0303K,Z := {f \u2208 \u1ebcn | f (K) \u2282 Z},\nwhere K \u2282 Vn is compact and Z \u2282 E a zero neighborhood. The\ncontinuity of the first inclusion is then obvious.\nWith the mentioned identifications, the second inclusion is given by\nthe map f \u2192 F described in the previous proof. Let a neighborhood\nW = WK,O \u2282 E4n be given. Let K \u2032 \u2282 V4n be an arbitrary compact\nneighborhood of 0. By compactness of K \u2282 GV4n we obtain a finite\nunion K \u2282 \u222agi K \u2032 \u2282 GV4n . Let O \u2032 = \u2229\u03c0(gi )\u22121 (O), then W\u0303 = W\u0303K \u2032 ,O\u2032 is\nan open neighborhood of 0 in \u1ebcn , and f \u2208 W\u0303 \u21d2 F \u2208 W.\n\u0003\nWe endow E \u03c9 with the inductive limit topology of the ascending\nunions in Lemma 3.2. The Hausdorff property follows, since E is assumed to be Hausdorff. It follows from Lemma 3.3, that the two unions\ngive rise to the same topology. In symbols:\n(3.2)\n\nE \u03c9 = lim En = lim \u1ebcn \u2282 E\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nn\u2192\u221e\n\nwith continuous inclusion into E. Since the restriction O(GVn , E) \u2192\nC \u221e (G, E) is continuous for all n \u2208 N, we have E \u03c9 \u2282 E \u221e with continuous inclusion.\n\n\fANALYTIC REPRESENTATIONS\n\n9\n\nObserve that an intertwining operator T : E \u2192 F between two representations (\u03c0, E), (\u03c1, F ) carries E \u03c9 continuously into F \u03c9 . In fact, if\nv \u2208 En with the holomorphically extended orbit map z 7\u2192 \u03c0(z)v, then\nT v \u2208 Fn since z 7\u2192 T \u03c0(z)v is a holomorphic extension of the orbit map\ng 7\u2192 \u03c1(g)T v = T \u03c0(g)v. It follows that T maps En continuously into\nFn for each n.\nNotice that if we define a continuous action of G on O(GVn , E) by\n(g * f )(z) := \u03c0(g)f (g \u22121z)\n\n(g \u2208 G, z \u2208 GVn ),\n\nthen the image of v 7\u2192 \u03c0n (*)v is the subspace O(GVn , E)G of Ginvariant functions, with inverse map given by evaluation at 1. Thus\nEn is identified with a closed subspace of O(GVn , E). In particular,\nit follows (see [14], p. 365) that En is complete/Fr\u00e9chet if E has this\nproperty.\nLet us briefly recall the structure of the open neighborhoods of zero in\nthe limit E \u03c9 . If A is a subset of some vector space, then we write \u0393(A)\nfor the convex hull of A. Now given for each n an open 0-neighborhood\nWn in En (or \u1ebcn ), the set\n[\n(3.3)\nW := \u0393(\nWn )\nn\u2208N\n\nis an open convex neighborhood of 0 in E \u03c9 . The set of neighborhoods\nW thus obtained form a filter base of the 0-neighborhoods in E \u03c9 .\n\nProposition 3.4. Let (\u03c0, E) be a representation of a Lie group on a\ntopological vector space E. Then the following assertions hold:\n(i) The action G \u00d7 E \u03c9 \u2192 E \u03c9 is continuous, hence defines a representation (\u03c0, E \u03c9 ) of G.\n(ii) Each v \u2208 E \u03c9 is an analytic vector for (\u03c0, E \u03c9 ) and\n(E \u03c9 )\u03c9 = E \u03c9\nas topological vector spaces.\nProof. In (i) it suffices to prove continuity at (1, v) for each v \u2208 E \u03c9 .\nWe first prove the separate continuity of g 7\u2192 \u03c0(g)v \u2208 E \u03c9 . Let v \u2208 En ,\nand consider the E-valued holomorphic extension of g 7\u2192 \u03c0(g)v. Since\nmultiplication in GC is holomorphic and V2n * V2n \u2282 Vn , it follows\nthat for each z1 \u2208 V2n the element \u03c02n (z1 )v belongs to E2n , with the\nholomorphic extension\n(3.4) z2 7\u2192 \u03c02n (z2 )\u03c02n (z1 )v := \u03c0n (z2 z1 )v\n\n(z1 , z2 \u2208 GV2n , v \u2208 En )\n\nof the orbit map. In particular, (3.4) holds for z1 = g \u2208 U2n . The\nelement \u03c0(z2 g)v \u2208 E depends continuously on g, locally uniformly\n\n\f10\n\nGIMPERLEIN, KR\u00d6TZ, AND SCHLICHTKRULL\n\nwith respect to z2 . It follows that g 7\u2192 \u03c0(g)v is continuous U2n \u2192 E2n ,\nhence into E \u03c9 .\nIn order to conclude the full continuity of (i) it now suffices to establish the following:\n(*) For all compact subsets B \u2282 G the operators {\u03c0(g) | g \u2208 B}\nform an equicontinuous subset of End(E \u03c9 ).\nBefore proving this, we note that for every compact subset B \u2282 G\nand every m \u2208 N there exists n > m such that\nb\u22121 Vn b \u2282 Vm\n\n(b \u2208 B).\n\nThis follows from the continuity of the adjoint action. Then zb \u2208 GVm\nfor all z \u2208 GVn , and hence \u03c0(b)v \u2208 En for all b \u2208 B, v \u2208 Em with\n(3.5)\n\n\u03c0n (z)\u03c0(b)v = \u03c0m (zb)v.\n\nIn order to prove (*) we fix a compact set B \u2282 G. Given m \u2208 N\nwe choose n > m as above. We are going to prove equicontinuity\nB \u00d7 Em \u2192 En . An open neighborhood of 0 in En can be assumed of\nthe form\n(K, Z) := {f \u2208 En | f (K) \u2282 Z},\nwhere K \u2282 GVn is compact and Z \u2282 E a zero neighborhood. Then\nwith K \u2032 = \u222ab\u2208B b\u22121 Kb and Z \u2032 = \u2229b\u2208B \u03c0(b)\u22121 (Z) we obtain\nf (K \u2032 ) \u2282 Z \u2032 \u21d2 \u03c0(b)f (b\u22121 Kb) \u2282 Z\nfor all b \u2208 B and all functions f : GVm \u2192 E. If in addition f is Ginvariant, then the conclusion is f (Kb) \u2282 Z, and we have shown that\nthe right translation by b maps the zero neighborhood (K \u2032 , Z \u2032 ) in Em\ninto the zero neighborhood (K, Z) in En .\nThe equicontinuity B \u00d7 E \u03c9 \u2192 E \u03c9 is an easy consequence given the\ndescription (3.3) of the neighborhoods in the inductive limit. This\ncompletes the proof of (i).\nFor the proof of (ii), let v \u2208 En . In the first part of the proof we saw\nthat \u03c0(z1 )v \u2208 E2n for each z1 \u2208 V2n , with the holomorphically extended\norbit map given by (3.4). It then follows from Lemma 6.1, applied to\nV2n \u00d7 GV2n and the map (z1 , z2 ) 7\u2192 \u03c0(z2 z1 )v, that z1 7\u2192 \u03c0(*)\u03c0(z1 )v\nis holomorphic V2n \u2192 O(GV2n , E). Hence z1 7\u2192 \u03c0(z1 )v is holomorphic\ninto E2n , hence also into E \u03c9 . Thus g 7\u2192 \u03c0(g)v extends to a holomorphic\nE \u03c9 -valued map on V2n , and hence v \u2208 (E \u03c9 )\u03c9 by the second description\nin (3.2).\nFor the topological statement in (ii), we need to show that the identity map is continuous E \u03c9 \u2192 (E \u03c9 )\u03c9 . We just saw that the identity\nmap takes\n]\n\u03c9) ,\nEn \u2192 (E\n2n\n\n\fANALYTIC REPRESENTATIONS\n\n11\n\nhence it suffices to show continuity of this map for each n. The proof\ngiven above reduces to the statement that the map mentioned below\n(6.1) is continuous.\n\u0003\nCorollary 3.5. (E \u221e )\u03c9 = (E \u03c9 )\u221e = E \u03c9 as topological vector spaces.\nProof. The continuous inclusions E \u03c9 \u2282 E \u221e \u2282 E induce continuous\ninclusions E \u03c9 = (E \u03c9 )\u03c9 \u2282 (E \u221e )\u03c9 \u2282 E \u03c9 . With E replaced by E \u03c9 , the\nsame inclusions also imply (E \u03c9 )\u03c9 \u2282 (E \u03c9 )\u221e \u2282 E \u03c9 .\n\u0003\nWe are interested in the functorial properties of the construction.\nLemma 3.6. Let (\u03c0, E) be a representation, and let F \u2282 E be a closed\ninvariant subspace. Then\n(i) F \u03c9 = E \u03c9 \u2229 F as a topological space,\n(ii) E \u03c9 /F \u03c9 \u2282 (E/F )\u03c9 continuously.\nProof. (i) Obviously Fn \u2282 En for all n. Conversely, if v \u2208 En \u2229 F with\nholomorphically extended orbit map z 7\u2192 \u03c0(z)v \u2208 E, then \u03c0(g)v \u2208 F\nfor all g \u2208 G implies \u03c0(z)v \u2208 F for all z \u2208 GVn . Hence v \u2208 Fn . The\ntopological statement follows easily.\n(ii) The quotient map induces a continuous map E \u03c9 \u2192 (E/F )\u03c9 ,\nwhich in view of (i) induces the mentioned continuous inclusion.\n\u0003\nNotice also that if E1 , E2 are representations, then the product representations satisfy E1\u03c9 \u00d7 E2\u03c9 \u2243 (E1 \u00d7 E2 )\u03c9 .\n3.2. Completeness\nIn general completeness of E does not ensure that E \u03c9 is complete.\nFor Banach representations this is the case as the following result shows.\nProposition 3.7. Let (\u03c0, E) be a representation of G on a complete\nDF-space. Then E \u03c9 is complete.\nProof. Let (vi ) be a Cauchy net in E \u03c9 . It is Cauchy in E, hence\nconverges to some element v \u2208 E. Moreover, the net of orbit maps\n(\u03b3vi ) converges pointwise on G to \u03b3v . We need to show that \u03b3v is real\nanalytic, and using our assumptions on E it suffices to prove weak\nanalyticity, see Remark 3.1.\nLet K \u2282 G be any compact set. We consider the space A(K) of real\nanalytic functions on K. These are germs of holomorphic functions\ndefined on open neighborhoods V of K in GC , and A(K) is equipped\nwith the inductive topology. Since each O(V ) has the Montel property,\nthe limit is compact, so that A(K) inherits completeness from O(V ).\n\n\f12\n\nGIMPERLEIN, KR\u00d6TZ, AND SCHLICHTKRULL\n\nFor every \u03bb \u2208 E \u2032 we consider the mapping\nE \u03c9 \u2192 A(K), En \u220b v 7\u2192 germ of \u03bb \u25e6 \u03b3v .\nIt is clear that this is a continuous map. It follows that \u03bb \u25e6 \u03b3vi |K\nconverges in A(K), so that \u03bb \u25e6 \u03b3v is real analytic on K.\n\u0003\nRemark 3.8. Combining the proof above with [2], Theorem 3, leads to\na more general result for representations on Fr\u00e9chet spaces. In this case,\nE \u03c9 is complete whenever there is a fundamental system of seminorms\n{pn }n\u2208N for the topology of E such that\n\u2203n \u2200m \u2265 n \u2203k \u2265 m \u2203C > 0 \u2200v \u2208 E : pm (v)2 \u2264 Cpk (v)pn (v).\nRemark 3.9. An example by Grothendieck, [10], p. 95, may be adapted\nto give an example of an incomplete space of analytic vectors. Consider the regular representation of G = S 1 on the (complete) space\nE = C(S 1 , CN ), where CN is endowed with the product topology. The\nanalytic vectors for this action are sequences of functions, which extend\nholomorphically to a common annulus {z \u2208 C | 1 \u2212 \u03b5 < |z| < 1 + \u03b5}\nfor some \u03b5 > 0. Being a dense subspace of (C(S 1 )\u03c9 )N , E \u03c9 fails to be\ncomplete as well as sequentially complete.\n3.3. Definition of analytic representation\nMotivated by Proposition 3.4 we shall give the following definition.\nDefinition 3.10. A representation (\u03c0, E) is called analytic if E = E \u03c9\nholds as topological vector spaces.\nGiven a representation (\u03c0, E), Proposition 3.4 implies that (\u03c0, E \u03c9 )\nis an analytic representation.\nLemma 3.11. Let (\u03c0, E) be an analytic representation, and let F \u2282 E\nbe a closed invariant subspace. Then \u03c0 induces analytic representations\non both F and E/F .\nProof. This follows from Lemma 3.6. From (i) in that lemma we infer\nimmediately that F \u03c9 = F , and from (ii) we then conclude that E/F =\nE \u03c9 /F \u03c9 \u2192 (E/F )\u03c9 is continuous. The opposite inclusion is trivially\nvalid and continuous.\n\u0003\nExample 3.12. We consider the Fr\u00e9chet space E := O(GC ) with the\nright regular action of G,\n\u03c0(g)f (z) = f (zg)\n\n(g \u2208 G, z \u2208 GC , f \u2208 O(GC )) .\n\nIt is easy to see that (\u03c0, E) defines a representation. Given v \u2208 E,\nit follows from (6.1) that the orbit map \u03b3v : G \u2192 E extends to a\n\n\fANALYTIC REPRESENTATIONS\n\n13\n\nholomorphic mapping from GC to E. The same equation implies easily\nthat E = E \u03c9 as topological spaces. Thus (\u03c0, E) is analytic.\n3.4. Irreducible analytic representations\nIt is a natural question on which type of topological vector spaces\nE one can model irreducible analytic representations. The next result\nshows that this class is rather restrictive.\nTheorem 3.13. Let (\u03c0, E) be an irreducible representation of a reductive group on a Fr\u00e9chet space E. If E = E \u03c9 as vector spaces, then E\nis finite dimensional.\nProof. By passing to a covering group if necessary, we may assume that\nGC is simply connected. By assumption E \u03c9 = lim En identifies with\nE as vector spaces. The Grothendieck factorization theorem implies\nthat E = En for some n (see [11], Ch. 4, Sect. 5, Thm. 1). Hence\nthe operator \u03c0(x) := \u03c0n (x) is defined on E, for all x \u2208 Vn . We shall\nholomorphically extend to all x \u2208 GC .\nLet v \u2208 E. By the monodromy theorem it suffices to extend \u03c0(x)v\nalong all simple smooth curves starting at 1. Let \u03b3 : [0, 1] \u2192 GC\nbe such a curve with \u03b3(0) = 1. We select finitely many open sets\nU1 , . . . , Uk \u2282 GC which cover the curve \u03b3([0, 1]) and points\nxi = \u03b3(ti ),\n\n0 = t1 < * * * < tk < 1,\n\nsuch that 1 = x1 \u2208 U1 and xi \u2208 Ui \u2229 Ui\u22121 for i > 1. By choosing\nthe sets Ui sufficiently small (and sufficiently many) we may assume\nthat Ui \u2282 V2n xi for each i and also that the only non\u2013empty overlaps\nare among neighboring sets Ui and Ui\u22121 (to attain these properties\nit may be useful from the outset to select the sets inside a tubular\nneighborhood around the curve).\nIn particular, \u03c0(x)v is already defined for x \u2208 U1 \u2282 V2n . On\nU2 , . . . , Uk we recursively define\n\u03c0(x)v = \u03c0(z)\u03c0(xi )v,\n\nx = zxi \u2208 Ui \u2282 V2n xi ,\n\nwhere \u03c0(xi )v is defined in the preceding step. Clearly this depends\nholomorphically on x. However, in order to obtain a proper extension\nof x 7\u2192 \u03c0(x)v, we need to verify that \u03c0(x)v is well defined on overlaps\nbetween the Ui . What we need to show is that\n\u03c0(z)\u03c0(xi )v = \u03c0(zxi )v,\n\nzxi \u2208 Ui \u2229 Ui\u22121 .\n\nLet xi = yxi\u22121 where y \u2208 V2n . By the recursive definition we have\n\u03c0(xi )v = \u03c0(y)\u03c0(xi\u22121 )v and \u03c0(zxi )v = \u03c0(zy)\u03c0(xi\u22121 )v. Then the desired\nidentity follows since \u03c0(z)\u03c0(y) = \u03c0(zy) by (3.4).\n\n\f14\n\nGIMPERLEIN, KR\u00d6TZ, AND SCHLICHTKRULL\n\nThus the representation extends to an irreducible holomorphic representation of GC (also denoted by \u03c0) . If U < GC is a compact real\nform, then the Peter-Weyl theorem implies that \u03c0|U is irreducible and\nfinite dimensional.\n\u0003\nRemark 3.14. Non\u2013reductive groups, on the other hand, may have\nirreducible analytic actions on a Fr\u00e9chet space. As an example, consider the Schr\u00f6dinger representation of the Heisenberg group Hn on the\nFr\u00e9chet space\nE = {f \u2208 O(Cn ) | \u2200N, M \u2208 N : sup\nx\u2208Rn\n\nsup\n\n|f (x + iy)| eM |x| < \u221e}.\n\ny\u2208(\u2212N,N )n\n\nIt is irreducible as a restriction of the Schr\u00f6dinger representation on\nL2 (Rn ), and one readily verifies that E = E \u03c9 .\n\n4. The algebra of analytic superdecaying functions\nWe define a convolution algebra of analytic functions with fast decay.\nThe purpose is to obtain an algebra which acts on representations of\nrestricted growth, such as F-representations.\n4.1. Superdecaying functions\nLet us denote by dg the Riemannian measure on G associated to\nthe metric g and note that dg is a left Haar measure. It is of some\nrelevance below that there is a constant c > 0 such that\nZ\n(4.1)\ne\u2212cd(g) dg < \u221e\nG\n\n(see [5], p. 75, Lemme 2).\nWe define the space of superdecaying continuous function on G by\nR(G) := {f \u2208 C(G) | \u2200N \u2208 N : sup |f (g)|eN d(g) < \u221e}\ng\u2208G\n\nand equip it with the corresponding family of seminorms. Note that\nR(G) is independent of the choice of the left-invariant metric, and that\nit has the following properties:\nProposition 4.1.\n(i) R(G) is a Fr\u00e9chet space and the natural action of G \u00d7 G by\nleft-right displacements defines an F-representation,\n(ii) R(G) becomes a Fr\u00e9chet algebra under convolution:\nZ\nf \u2217 h(x) =\nf (y)h(y \u22121x) dy\nG\n\n\fANALYTIC REPRESENTATIONS\n\n15\n\nfor f, h \u2208 R(G) and x \u2208 G,\n(iii) Every F-representation (\u03c0, E) of G gives rise to a continuous\nalgebra representation of R(G),\nR(G) \u00d7 E \u2192 E, (f, v) 7\u2192 \u03a0(f )v,\nwhere\n\u03a0(f )v :=\n\nZ\n\nf (g)\u03c0(g)v dg\n\n(f \u2208 R(G), v \u2208 E)\n\nG\n\nas an E-valued integral.\nProof. Easy. Use (2.1), (2.3) and (4.1).\n\n\u0003\n\n4.2. Analytic superdecaying functions\nWe shall start with a discussion of the analytic vectors in R(G).\nHenceforth we shall view R(G) as a G-module for the left regular representation of G. We set A(G) := R(G)\u03c9 and equip A(G) with the\ncorresponding vector topology. With the notation from the preceding\nsection we put An (G) := R(G)n for each n \u2208 N. Notice that An (G) is\na Fr\u00e9chet space for each n, since R(G) is Fr\u00e9chet. Hence A(G) is an\nLF-space (inductive limit of Fr\u00e9chet spaces). In the Appendix we show\nthat A(G) is complete and reflexive.\nProposition 4.2.\n(i) A(G) carries representations of G by left and right action,\n(ii) A(G) is a subalgebra of R(G) and convolution is continuous\nA(G) \u00d7 A(G) \u2192 A(G).\nProof. (i) The statement about the left action is immediate from Proposition 3.4 (i). It is clear that A(G) is right invariant, since every right\ndisplacement f 7\u2192 Rg f is an intertwining operator for the left regular\nrepresentation. The continuity of the right action follows from Lemma\n4.3 below, see Remark 4.4.\n(ii) This follows from Proposition 4.6 (to be proved below) by taking\nE = R(G).\n\u0003\nThe next lemma gives us a concrete realization of An (G).\nLemma 4.3. For all n \u2208 N, restriction to G provides a topological\nisomorphism of\n(\n\u2200N > 0, \u2200\u03a9 \u2282 Vn compact :)\nf \u2208 O(Vn G)\nsup |f (zg)|eN d(g) < \u221e\ng\u2208G,z\u2208\u03a9\n\n\f16\n\nGIMPERLEIN, KR\u00d6TZ, AND SCHLICHTKRULL\n\nonto An (G). Here the space above is topologized by the seminorms\nmentioned in its definition.\nProof. Let f \u2208 An (G). Then \u03b3f : G \u2192 R(G), g 7\u2192 f (g \u22121 *) extends to a holomorphic map \u03b3f,n : GVn \u2192 R(G). As point evaluations\nR(G) \u2192 C are continuous, it follows that F (z) := \u03b3f,n (z \u22121 )(1) defines\na holomorphic extension of f to Vn G. Moreover, F (zg) = \u03b3f,n (z \u22121 )(g)\nfor z \u2208 Vn , g \u2208 G. Let N > 0 and a compact set \u03a9 \u2282 Vn be given, then\nsup |F (zg)|eN d(g) = sup pN (\u03b3f,n (z \u22121 )) < \u221e\ng\u2208G,z\u2208\u03a9\n\nz\u2208\u03a9\n\nwhere pN (h) = supg\u2208G |h(g)|eN d(g) is a defining seminorm of R(G).\nHence F belongs to the space above. Moreover, we see that f 7\u2192 F is\nan isomorphism onto its image.\nConversely, let F belong to the space above and put f := F |G . Then\nit is clear that f \u2208 R(G) (take \u03a9 = {1}). We need to show that\nf \u2208 An (G), i. e. that \u03b3f : G \u2192 R(G) extends to a holomorphic map\nGVn \u2192 R(G). The extension is z 7\u2192 F (z \u22121 *), and we need to show\nthat it is holomorphic.\nWe first show that z 7\u2192 F (z \u22121 *) is continuous into R(G). To see this,\nlet z0 \u2208 GVn and \u01eb, N > 0 be given. We wish to find a neighborhood\nD of z0 such that\n(4.2)\n\npN (F (z \u22121 *) \u2212 F (z0\u22121 *)) < \u01eb\n\nfor all z \u2208 D.\nLet us fix a compact neighborhood D0 of z0 in GVn . As\nsup\n\n|F (z \u22121 g)|emd(g) < \u221e\n\ng\u2208G,z\u2208D0\n\nfor all m > N we find a compact subset K \u2282 G such that\nsup\n\n|F (z \u22121 g)|eN d(g) < \u01eb/2.\n\ng\u2208G\\K,z\u2208D0\n\nShrinking D0 to some possibly smaller neighborhood D we may request\nthat\nsup |F (z \u22121 g) \u2212 F (z0\u22121 g)|eN d(g) < \u01eb .\ng\u2208K,z\u2208D\n\nThe required estimate 4.2 follows.\nAs continuity has been verified, holomorphicity follows provided z 7\u2192\n\u03bb(F (z \u22121 *)) is holomorphic for \u03bb ranging in a subset whose linear span\nis weakly dense in R(G)\u2032 (see [9], p. 39, Remarque 1). A convenient\nsuch subset is {\u03b4g | g \u2208 G}, and the proof is complete.\n\u0003\n\n\fANALYTIC REPRESENTATIONS\n\n17\n\nRemark 4.4. Let q(f ) := supg\u2208G,z\u2208\u03a9 |f (zg)|eN d(g) be a seminorm on\nAn (G) as above. Then (2.1) implies\nq(Rx f ) \u2264 eN d(x) q(f ) (f \u2208 An (G)) ,\nfor x \u2208 G, so An (G) is an F-representation for the right action.\n4.3. Analytic vectors of F-representations\nLet (\u03c0, E) be an F-representation of G, and let v \u2208 E. The map\nf 7\u2192 \u03a0(f )v is intertwining from R(G) (with left action) to E. Hence\n\u03a0(f )v \u2208 En for f \u2208 An (G) and \u03a0(f )v \u2208 E \u03c9 for f \u2208 A(G). With the\npreceding characterization of An (G) we have\nZ\n(4.3)\n\u03c0(z)\u03a0(f )v =\nf (z \u22121 g)\u03c0(g)v dg\nG\n\nfor f \u2208 An (G), z \u2208 GVn .\n\nRemark 4.5. In particular\n\u03a0(A(G))E \u03c9 \u2282 E \u03c9\nfor F-representations. In fact one can show (see [6]) that\n\u03a0(A(G))E \u03c9 = E \u03c9 .\nIt is easily seen that the action of A(G) on E \u03c9 is an algebra action.\nWe shall now see that it is continuous.\nProposition 4.6. Let (\u03c0, E) be an F-representation. The bilinear map\n(f, v) 7\u2192 \u03a0(f )v is continuous\nAn (G) \u00d7 E \u2192 En ,\nfor every n \u2208 N. Likewise, it is continuous\nA(G) \u00d7 E \u2192 E \u03c9 .\nNotice that since E \u03c9 injects continuously in E, the last statement\nimplies continuity of both\nA(G) \u00d7 E \u2192 E\n\nand A(G) \u00d7 E \u03c9 \u2192 E \u03c9 .\n\nProof. Let n \u2208 N be fixed and let W \u2282 En be an open neighborhood\nof 0. We may assume\nW = WK,p := {v \u2208 En | p(\u03c0(K)v) < 1}\nwith K \u2282 GVn compact and p a continuous seminorm on E such that\np(\u03c0(g)v) \u2264 Cecd(g) p(v)\nfor some constants c, C (see 2.3).\n\n(g \u2208 G, v \u2208 E)\n\n\f18\n\nGIMPERLEIN, KR\u00d6TZ, AND SCHLICHTKRULL\n\nChoose N > 0 so that (cf 4.1)\nZ\nC1 :=\ne(c\u2212N )d(g) dg < \u221e,\nG\n\nand let\n\nO := {f \u2208 O(Vn G) |\n\nsup |f (z \u22121 g)|eN d(g) < \u01eb} \u2282 An (G)\nz\u2208K,g\u2208G\n\n(with \u01eb to be specified below). According to Lemma 4.3, O is open.\nFor f \u2208 O and z \u2208 K we obtain by (4.3)\nZ\np(\u03c0(z)\u03a0(f )v) \u2264\n|f (z \u22121 g)| p(\u03c0(g)v)) dg \u2264 \u01ebCC1 p(v).\nG\n\nWith \u01eb < 1/(CC1 ) we conclude that \u03a0(f )v \u2208 W if f \u2208 O and p(v) < 1.\nThis proves the first statement. By taking inductive limits we infer\ncontinuity of lim(An (G)\u00d7E) \u2192 E \u03c9 . For the continuity of A(G)\u00d7E \u2192\nE \u03c9 it now suffices to verify that lim(An (G) \u00d7 E) and A(G) \u00d7 E =\n(lim An (G)) \u00d7 E are isomorphic. The map\nlim(An (G) \u00d7 E) \u2192 (lim An (G)) \u00d7 E\nis clearly bijective and continuous. The left hand side is LF, and the\nright hand side is a product of ultrabornological spaces, hence itself\nultrabornological. It follows that the open mapping theorem can be\napplied (see [18], Theorem 24.30 and Remarks 24.15, 24.36).\n\u0003\nFor later use we note that A(G) contains a Dirac sequence.\nLemma 4.7. The heat kernel ht belongs to A(G) for each t > 0. Let\nE be an F-representation. Then \u03a0(ht )v \u2192 v in E for all v \u2208 E.\nProof. The convergence in E is Nelson's theorem (see Section 3). The\nheat kernel belongs to A(G) for all t > 0 by [6], Thm. 4.2.\n\u0003\nRemark 4.8. It follows from the proof of [6], Thm. 4.2, that there\nexists a common m such that ht \u2208 Am (G) for all t > 0.\n4.4. A(G)-tempered representations\nAs we have seen that there is continuous algebra action of A(G) on\nthe analytic vectors of F-representations, we shall make this property\npart of a definition.\nDefinition 4.9. A representation (\u03c0, E) is called A(G)-tempered if\nfor all f \u2208 A(G) and v \u2208 E the vector valued integral\nZ\n\u03a0(f )v =\nf (g)\u03c0(g)v dg\nG\n\n\fANALYTIC REPRESENTATIONS\n\n19\n\nconverges in E, and (f, v) 7\u2192 \u03a0(f )v defines a continuous algebra action\nA(G) \u00d7 E \u2192 E.\nExample 4.10. (a) For every F-representation (\u03c0, E) both (\u03c0, E) itself\nand (\u03c0, E \u03c9 ) are A(G)-tempered according to Proposition 4.6. In particular this holds for all Banach representations and also for E = R(G)\nwith the left action (so that E \u03c9 = A(G)).\n(b) If (\u03c0, E) is an A(G)-tempered representation and F \u2282 E is a closed\nG-invariant subspace, then the induced representations on F and E/F\nare A(G)-tempered.\n\n5. Analytic globalizations of Harish-Chandra modules\nIn this section we will assume that G is a real reductive group. Let\nus fix a maximal compact subgroup K < G. We say that a complex\nvector space V is a (g, K)-module if V is endowed with a Lie algebra\naction of g and a locally finite group action of K which are compatible\nin the sense that the derived and restricted actions of k agree and, in\naddition,\nk * (X * v) = (Ad(k)X) * (k * v)\n\n(k \u2208 K, X \u2208 g, v \u2208 V ) .\n\nWe call a (g, K)-module admissible if for any irreducible representation\n(\u03c3, W ) of K the multiplicity space HomK (W, V ) is finite dimensional.\nFinally, an admissible (g, K)-module is called a Harish-Chandra module\nif V is finitely generated as a U(g)-module. Here, as usual, U(g) denotes\nthe universal enveloping algebra of g.\nBy a globalization of a Harish-Chandra module V we understand a\nrepresentation (\u03c0, E) of G such that the space of K-finite vectors\nEK := {v \u2208 E | dim spanC {\u03c0(K)v} < \u221e}\nis (g, K)-isomorphic to V and dense in E. Density of EK is automatic whenever E is quasi-complete, see [13], Lemma\nP 4. Each element v \u2208 E allows an expansion in K-types v =\n\u03c4 \u2208K\u0302 v\u03c4 , where\nv\u03c4 = dim \u03c4 \u03c0(\u03c7\u03c4 )v \u2208 EK . Here, the integral over K that defines \u03c0(\u03c7\u03c4 )v\nmay take place in the completion of E, but v\u03c4 belongs to EK by density\nand finite dimensionality of K-type spaces.\nA Banach (F-, analytic, A(G)-tempered) globalization is a globalization by a Banach (F-, analytic, A(G)-tempered) representation. Note\nthat according to Harish-Chandra [12], EK \u2282 E \u03c9 if E is a Banach\nglobalization. In general, the orbit map of a vector v \u2208 EK is weakly\nanalytic (see Remark 3.1).\n\n\f20\n\nGIMPERLEIN, KR\u00d6TZ, AND SCHLICHTKRULL\n\nAccording to the subrepresentation theorem of Casselman (see [22]\nThm. 3.8.3), V admits a Banach-globalization E. The space E \u03c9 is then\nan analytic A(G)-tempered globalization.\nIf V is a Harish-Chandra module, we denote by \u1e7c the Harish-Chandra\nmodule dual to V , i.e. the space of K-finite linear forms on V (see [22],\np. 115). We note that if E is a globalization of V , then \u1e7c embeds into\nE \u2032 and identifies with the subspace of K-finite continuous linear forms\n(see [3], Prop. 2.2). Furthermore \u1e7c separates on E. Since the matrix\ncoefficients x 7\u2192 \u03be(\u03c0(x)v) for v \u2208 V, \u03be \u2208 \u1e7c are real analytic functions\non G, they are determined by their germs at 1. It follows that these\nfunctions on G are independent of the globalization (see [3], p. 396).\n5.1. Minimal analytic globalizations\nLet V be a Harish-Chandra module and v = {v1 , . . . , vk } be a set\nof U(g)-generators. We shall fix an arbitrary A-tempered globalization\n(\u03c0, E) and regard V as a subspace in E.\nOn the product space A(G)k = A(G) \u00d7 * * * \u00d7 A(G) with diagonal\nG-action, we consider the G-equivariant map\nk\n\n\u03a6v : A(G) \u2192 E, f = (f1 , . . . , fk ) 7\u2192\n\nk\nX\n\n\u03a0(fj )vj ,\n\nj=1\n\nand write Iv for its kernel. This map is evidently continuous, and thus\nIv is a closed G-invariant\nsubspace of A(G)k . We note that f \u2208 Iv\nP R\nif and only if\nfj (g)\u03be(\u03c0(g)vj ) dg = 0 for all \u03be \u2208 \u1e7c . It follows\nj\nthat Iv is independent of the choice of globalization. Furthermore, the\ndependence on generators is easily described: If v\u2032 is another set of\ngenerators, say k \u2032 in number, there exists a k \u00d7 k \u2032 -matrix u of elements\nfrom U(g) such that f \u2208 Iv if and only if Ru f \u2208 Iv\u2032 .\nSince Iv is closed and G-invariant, the quotient\nV min := A(G)k /Iv\ncarries a representation of G which we denote by (\u03c0, V min ). It is independent of the choice of the globalization (\u03c0, E) and (up to equivalence)\nof the set v of generators.\nLemma 5.1. Let V be a Harish-Chandra module. Then the following\nassertions hold:\n(i) V min is an analytic A(G)-tempered globalization of V .\n(ii) V min = \u03a0(A(G))V , that is, V min is spanned by the vectors of\nform \u03a0(f )v.\n\n\fANALYTIC REPRESENTATIONS\n\n21\n\n(iii) If (\u03bb, F ) is any A-tempered globalization of V , then the identity mapping V \u2192 F lifts to a G-equivariant continuous injection V min \u2192 F \u03c9 .\nProof. (i) It follows from the definition that V min is analytic (see Lemma\n3.6) and A(G)-tempered (see Example 4.10(b)). It remains to be seen\nthat (V min)K is (g, K)-isomorphic to V . By definition, \u03a6v induces a\ncontinuous G-equivariant injection V min \u2192 E. In particular (V min )K\nis isomorphic to a (g, K)-submodule of V = EK . Moreover as A(G)\ncontains a Dirac sequence by Lemma 4.7, and as we may assume E to\nbe a Banach space, each generator vj belongs to the E-closure of the\nimage of V min . By admissibility and finite dimensionality of K-types,\nvj belongs to (V min)K for each j. Thus (V min )K \u2243 V and (i) follows.\nAssertions (ii) and (iii) are clear.\n\u0003\nBecause of property (iii), we shall refer to V min as the minimal A(G)tempered globalization of V . We record the following functorial properties of the construction.\nLemma 5.2. Let V, W be Harish-Chandra modules.\n(i) Every (g, K)-homomorphism T : W \u2192 V lifts to a unique intertwining operator T min : W min \u2192 V min with restriction T on\nW = (W min)K and with closed image.\n(ii) Assume that W \u2282 V is a submodule. Then\n(a) W min is equivalent with a subrepresentation of V min on a\nclosed invariant subspace,\n(b) (V /W )min is equivalent with the quotient representation\nV min /W min.\nProof. (i) Let T\u0303 : \u1e7c \u2192 W\u0303 denote the dual map of T , and observe that\nT\u0303 \u03be(\u03c0(g)w) = \u03be(\u03c0(g)T w)\nfor all w \u2208 W, \u03be \u2208 \u1e7c and g \u2208 G. Indeed, these are analytic functions\nof g whose power series at 1 agree because T is a g-homomorphism.\nIt follows that if we choose generators w1 , . . . , wl for W and v1 , . . . , vk\nfor V such that vj = T wj for j = 1, . . . , l, then the inclusion map\nf 7\u2192 (f, 0) of A(G)l into A(G)k takes Iw into Iv . Hence this inclusion\nmap induces a map\nT min : A(G)l /Iw \u2192 A(G)k /Iv\nwhich is continuous, intertwining and has closed image. Moreover, this\nmap restricts to T on W , since it maps each generator wj to vj = T wj .\n(ii) is obtained from (i) with T equal to (a) the inclusion map W \u2192 V\nor (b) the quotient map V \u2192 V /W .\n\u0003\n\n\f22\n\nGIMPERLEIN, KR\u00d6TZ, AND SCHLICHTKRULL\n\nOur next concern will be to realize the analytic globalizations inside\nof Banach modules.\nProposition 5.3. Let (\u03c0, E) be an analytic A(G)-tempered globalization of a Harish-Chandra module V . Then there exists a Banach\nrepresentation (\u03c3, F ) of G and a continuous G-equivariant injection\n(\u03c0, E) \u2192 (\u03c3, F ).\nProof. We fix generators \u03be = {\u03be1 , . . . , \u03bel } of the dual Harish-Chandra\nmodule \u1e7c \u2282 E \u2032 and put U := {v \u2208 E | max1\u2264j\u2264l |\u03bej (v)| < 1}. Then U\nis an open neighborhood of 0 in E.\nFix m \u2208 N such that Am (G) contains a Dirac sequence (see Remark\n4.8). As Am (G) \u00d7 E \u2192 E is continuous, we find an open neighborhood\nO of 0 in Am (G) and an open neighborhood W of 0 in E such that\n\u03a0(O)W \u2282 U. We may assume that O is of the type O = {f \u2208 Am (G) |\nq(f ) < 1} where\nq(f ) = sup |f (zg)|eN d(g)\ng\u2208G\nz\u2208\u03a9\n\nfor some N \u2208 N and \u03a9 \u2282 Vm compact. Define the normed space X :=\n(Am (G), q). It follows from Remark 4.4 that the right regular action\nof G is a representation by bounded operators on X. Let F := (X \u2217 )l\nbe the topological dual of X l and \u03c3 the corresponding dual diagonal\naction of G. Note that F is a Banach space, being the dual of a normed\nspace, so that \u03c3 is a Banach representation. We claim that the map\n!\nl\nX\n\u03c6 : E \u2192 F, v 7\u2192 f = (f1 , . . . , fl ) 7\u2192\n\u03bej (\u03a0(fj )v)\nj=1\n\nis G-equivariant, continuous and injective. Equivariance is clear, and\nin order to establish continuity we fix a closed convex neighborhood \u00d5\nof 0 in F . We may assume that \u00d5 is a polar of the form \u00d5 = [B l ]o\nwhere B is a bounded set B \u2282 X. Because B is bounded, there exists\n\u03bb > 0 such that B \u2282 \u03bbO. Choosing W\u0303 := \u03bb1 W we have \u03c6(W\u0303 ) \u2282 \u00d5, as\nl\n\n1\n1X\n\u03bej (\u03a0(O)W )\n\u03c6(W\u0303 )(B ) \u2282 \u03c6(W )(O l) \u2282\nl\nl j=1\nl\n\nl\n\n1X\n\u03bej (U) \u2282 {z \u2208 C | |z| \u2264 1} .\n\u2282\nl j=1\n\nIt remains to be shown that \u03c6 is injective. Suppose that \u03c6(v) = 0.\nThen \u03c6(v\u03c4 ) = 0 for each element v\u03c4 in the K-finite expansion of v, so\nthat we may assume v is K-finite.

Since K-finite matrix coefficients are\nindependent of globalizations, we conclude by Lemma 4.7 that \u03b7(v) = 0\nand hence v = 0.\n\u0003\n5.2. The minimal analytic globalization of a spherical principal\nseries representation\nLet G = KAN be an Iwasawa decomposition of G and denote by\nM the centralizer of A in K, i.e. M = ZK (A). Then P = MAN is a\nminimal parabolic subgroup. Let us denote by a, n the Lie algebras of\nA and N and define \u03c1 \u2208 a\u2217 by \u03c1(X) = 21 tr(ad X|n ), X \u2208 a. For \u03bb \u2208 a\u2217C\nand a \u2208 A we set a\u03bb := e\u03bb(log a) .\nThe smooth spherical principal series with parameter \u03bb \u2208 a\u2217C is defined by\nV\u03bb\u221e := {f \u2208 C \u221e (G) | \u2200man \u2208 P \u2200g \u2208 G : f (mang) = a\u03c1+\u03bb f (g)} .\nThe action of G on V\u03bb\u221e is by right displacements in the arguments, and\nin this way we obtain a smooth F-representation (\u03c0\u03bb , V\u03bb\u221e ) of G. We\ndenote the Harish-Chandra module of V\u03bb\u221e by V\u03bb .\nIt is useful to observe that the restriction mapping to K,\nResK : V\u03bb\u221e \u2192 C \u221e (M\\K),\nis an K-equivariant isomorphism of Fr\u00e9chet spaces, and henceforth we\nwill identify V\u03bb\u221e with C \u221e (M\\K). The space V\u03bb of K-finite vectors\nin V\u03bb\u221e is then identified as a K-module with the space C(M\\K)K of\nK-finite functions on M\\K.\nLikewise, the Hilbert space H\u03bb := L2 (M\\K) is provided with the\nrepresentation \u03c0\u03bb . The space of smooth vectors for this representation\nis H\u03bb\u221e = V\u03bb\u221e = C \u221e (M\\K), and the space of analytic vectors is the\nspace H\u03bb\u03c9 = V\u03bb\u03c9 := C \u03c9 (M\\K) of analytic functions on M\\K with its\nusual topology.\nTheorem 5.4. For every \u03bb \u2208 a\u2217C one has\n\u03a0\u03bb (A(G))V\u03bb = C \u03c9 (M\\K) .\nIn particular V\u03bbmin \u2243 V\u03bb\u03c9 = C \u03c9 (M\\K) as analytic representations.\nThe proof of this theorem is similar to the corresponding result in\nthe smooth case (see [1], Section 4). Note that from Lemma 5.1 we\nhave\n\u03a0\u03bb (A(G))V\u03bb = V\u03bbmin \u2282 V\u03bb\u03c9\nwith continuous inclusion. As the space V\u03bbmin admits a web (see [18],\n24.8 and 24.28) and C \u03c9 (M\\K) is ultrabornological (see [18], 24.16), we\n\n\f24\n\nGIMPERLEIN, KR\u00d6TZ, AND SCHLICHTKRULL\n\ncan apply the open mapping theorem ([18], 24.30) to obtain an identity\nof topological spaces from the set-theoretical identity. It thus suffices\nto prove that for each v \u2208 V\u03bb\u03c9 there exists \u03be \u2208 V\u03bb and F \u2208 A(G) such\nthat \u03a0(F )\u03be = v.\nWe need some technical preparations. Let us denote by g = k + p the\nCartan decomposition of g, and write \u03b8 for the corresponding Cartan\ninvolution. Let (*, *) be a non\u2013degenerate invariant bilinear form on\ng which is positive definite on p and negative definite on k. Then\nh*, *i = \u2212(\u03b8*, *) defines an inner product on g, which we use to identify\ng and g\u2217 . We write | * | for the norms induced on g and g\u2217 .\nLet X1 , . . . , Xs be an orthonormal basis of k and Y1 , . . . , Yl be an\northonormal basis of p. We define elements in the universal enveloping\nalgebra U(g) by\n\u2206=\n\ns\nX\n\nXj2\n\n+\n\nl\nX\n\nYi2\n\n,\n\nXj2\n\nand C := \u2206 \u2212 2\u2206K .\n\nj=1\n\ni=1\n\nj=1\n\n\u2206K =\n\ns\nX\n\nNote that C is a Casimir element. In particular, it belongs to the center\nof U(g).\nLet t \u2282 k be a maximal torus. We fix a positive system of the\nroot system \u03a3(tC , kC ) and identify the unitary dual K\u0302 via their highest\nweights with a subset of it\u2217 . If (\u03c4, W\u03c4 ) is an irreducible representation\nof K, then \u2206K acts as the scalar multiple |\u03c4 + \u03c1k |2 \u2212 |\u03c1k |2 . For every\n\u03c4 \u2208 K\u0302 we denote by \u03c7\u03c4 \u2208 C(K) the normalized character \u03c7\u03c4 (k) =\n(dim W\u03c4 )\u22121 tr \u03c4 (k). Note that C(K) acts on A(G) by left convolution.\nWe denote the left regular representation of G on A(G) by L. The\nfollowing proposition will be crucial in the proof of Theorem 5.4.\nProposition 5.5. Let (c\u03c4 )\u03c4 \u2208K\u0302 be a sequence of complex numbers and\n(a\u03c4 )\u03c4 \u2208K\u0302 a sequence of elements in G. Assume that\n|c\u03c4 | \u2264 Ce\u2212\u01eb|\u03c4 | ,\n\nd(a\u03c4 ) \u2264 c1 log(1 + |\u03c4 |) + c2\n\nfor some C, \u01eb, c1 , c2 > 0. Let f \u2208 A(G). Then\nX\nF :=\nc\u03c4 \u03c7\u03c4 \u2217 L(a\u03c4 )f \u2208 A(G) .\n\u03c4 \u2208K\u0302\n\nProof. As (L, R(G)) is an F-representation, it follows from [6] that\nh \u2208 R(G) is belongs to A(G) if and only if there exists an M > 0 such\nthat for all N \u2208 N there exists a constant CN > 0 with\n(5.1)\n\nsup eN d(g) |\u2206k h(g)| \u2264 CN M 2k (2k)!\ng\u2208G\n\nfor all k \u2208 N.\n\n\fANALYTIC REPRESENTATIONS\n\n25\n\nObserve that \u2206 = C + 2\u2206K . For every h \u2208 R(G) one has\n\u2206K (\u03c7\u03c4 \u2217 h) = (|\u03c4 + \u03c1k |2 \u2212 |\u03c1k |2 )\u03c7\u03c4 \u2217 h .\n\n(5.2)\n\nMoreover as C is central we obtain for every g \u2208 G and h \u2208 A(G) that\n(5.3)\n\nC(\u03c7\u03c4 \u2217 L(g)h) = \u03c7\u03c4 \u2217 L(g)(Ch) .\n\nLet now f \u2208 A(G). As f is an analytic vector for R(G), hence also\nfor L2 (G), we find (see [23], Cor. 4.4.6.4) a constant M1 > 0 such that\nfor all N > 0 there exists a constant CN > 0 such that\nsup eN d(g) |Ck f (g)| \u2264 CN M12k (2k)! .\n\n(5.4)\n\ng\u2208G\n\nWe first estimate \u2206k (\u03c7\u03c4 \u2217 L(a\u03c4 )f ).

The proof is\neasily adapted to the general case. The set K\u0302 is parametrized by a\nsemilattice in it\u2217 , say K\u0302 = {m1 \u03c41 + * * * + ml \u03c4l | m1 , . . . , ml \u2208 N}. We\nshall perform the summation over K\u0302 by summing over m \u2208 N, and\nover those elements \u03c4 for which the maximal mj is m. There are l ml\u22121\nsuch elements, and they all satisfy am \u2264 |\u03c4 | \u2264 bm for some a, b > 0\nindependent of m. It follows that the sum above is dominated by\nX\nlml\u22121 e\u2212\u01ebam (1 + bm)n .\nm\u2208N\n\nThe given estimate now follows easily.\n\n\u0003\n\nBefore we give the proof of Theorem 5.4, we recall some harmonic\n\u2227\nanalysis for the compact homogeneous space M\\K. We denote by KM\nthe M-spherical part of K\u0302, that is, the equivalence classes of irreducible\nrepresentations \u03c4 for which the space V\u03c4M of M-fixed vectors is non\u2013\nzero. Then\n\u02c6 \u03c4 \u2208K \u2227 Hom(V\u03c4M , V\u03c4 )\n(5.5)\nL2 (M\\K) = \u2295\nM\nP\nby the Peter\u2013Weyl theorem. We write v = \u03c4 v\u03c4 for the corresponding\ndecomposition of a function v on M\\K and note that with the right\naction of k \u2208 K on L2 (M\\K) we have [\u03c0(k)v]\u03c4 = \u03c4 (k) \u25e6 v\u03c4 .\nFurthermore,\nX\n\b\nC \u03c9 (M\\K) = v =\nv\u03c4 \u2203\u01eb, C > 0 \u2200\u03c4 : ||v\u03c4 || \u2264 Ce\u2212\u01eb|\u03c4 | ,\n\u03c4\n\nwhere kv\u03c4 k denotes the operator norm of v\u03c4 R.\n\u2227\nLet \u03c4 \u2208 KM\n. The integral \u03b4\u03c4 (k) = dim(\u03c4 ) M \u03c7\u03c4 (mk) dm of the character is bi-invariant under M. The components of \u03b4\u03c4 in the decomposition (5.5) are all 0 except the \u03c4 -component, which is the inclusion\noperator I\u03c4 of V\u03c4M into V\u03c4 .\n\n\fANALYTIC REPRESENTATIONS\n\n27\n\nProof. We can now finally give the proof of Theorem 5.4. Let v =\nP\n\u03c9\n\u03c4 v\u03c4 \u2208 C (M\\K) be given, and let \u01eb > 0 be as above.\nIt follows from [1], Section 6, that there exists a K\u2013finite function\n\u2227\n\u03be \u2208 V\u03bb , and for each \u03c4 \u2208 KM\nelements a\u03c4 \u2208 A and c\u03c4 \u2208 C such that\nd(a\u03c4 ) \u2264 c1 log(1 + |\u03c4 |) + c2 ,\n\n|c\u03c4 | \u2264 2(1 + |\u03c4 |)c3\n\nfor some constants c1 , c2 , c3 > 0 independent of \u03c4 , and such that\nR\u03c4 := \u03b4\u03c4 \u2212 c\u03c4 [\u03c0\u03bb (a\u03c4 )\u03be]\u03c4\nsatisfies kR\u03c4 k \u2264 1/2 for all \u03c4 . By integration of \u03be and R\u03c4 over M we\ncan arrange that they are both M\u2013biinvariant.\nWe now P\nchoose a function f \u2208 A(G) such that \u03a0(f )\u03be = \u03be. It exists\nbecause \u03a0( \u03c4 \u2208F \u03c7\u03c4 \u2217 ht )\u03be converges to \u03be for t \u2192 0 and some finite set\nF of K-types by Lemma 4.7, so that \u03be belongs to the closure of a finite\ndimensional subspace of \u03a0(A(G))\u03be. According to Proposition 5.5, the\nfunction\nX\n1\nF =\nc\u03c4 e\u2212 2 \u01eb|\u03c4 | \u03c7\u03c4 \u2217 L(a\u03c4 )f\n\u03c4\n\nbelongs to A(G). An easy calculation shows that\nX 1\n\u03a0(F )\u03be =\ne\u2212 2 \u01eb|\u03c4 | (\u03b4\u03c4 \u2212 R\u03c4 ) .\n\u03c4\n\nBeing of type \u03c4 and M\u2013biinvariant, R\u03c4 corresponds in (5.5) to an\noperator R\u03c4 \u2208 End(V\u03c4M ). Since kR\u03c4 k \u2264 1/2, the operator I\u03c4 \u2212 R\u03c4 \u2208\nEnd(V\u03c4M ) is invertible with k(I\u03c4 \u2212 R\u03c4 )\u22121 k \u2264 2. Then v\u03c4 (I\u03c4 \u2212 R\u03c4 )\u22121 \u2208\nHom(V\u03c4M , V\u03c4 ) with kv\u03c4 (I\u03c4 \u2212 R\u03c4 )\u22121 k \u2264 2Ce\u2212\u01eb|\u03c4 | . It follows that the\nfunction on M\\K with the expansion\nX 1\ne 2 \u01eb|\u03c4 | v\u03c4 (I\u03c4 \u2212 R\u03c4 )\u22121\n\u03c4\n\nbelongs to C \u03c9 (M\\K). We denote by h(k \u22121 ) this function, so that h\nis a right M\u2013invariant function on K. Another easy calculation now\nshows that\nX\n\u03a0(h)\u03a0(F )\u03be =\nv\u03c4 = v ,\n\u03c4\n\nand hence h \u2217 F \u2208 A(G) is the function we seek.\n\n\u0003\n\n5.3. Unique analytic globalization\nThe goal of this section is to prove the following version of Schmid's\nminimal globalization theorem ([15], Theorem 2.13).\n\n\f28\n\nGIMPERLEIN, KR\u00d6TZ, AND SCHLICHTKRULL\n\nTheorem 5.7. Let V be a Harish-Chandra module. Every analytic\nA(G)-tempered globalization of V is isomorphic to V min .\nIn particular, if (\u03c0, E) is an arbitrary F-globalization of V , then\nE \u03c9 \u2243 V min .\nProof. We first treat the case of an irreducible Harish-Chandra module V .\nWe first claim that V admits a Hilbert globalization H such that\nH\u03c9 = \u03a0(A(G))V , and hence in particular (see Lemma 5.1 (ii))\nH\u03c9 \u2243 V min .\nIn case V = V\u03bb we can take H\u03bb = L2 (M\\K) and the assertion\nfollows from Theorem 5.4. If the Harish-Chandra module is of the\ntype V = V\u03bb \u2297 W where W is a finite dimensional G-module, then\nH = H\u03bb \u2297 W is a Hilbert globalization with H\u03c9 = H\u03bb\u03c9 \u2297 W . A\nstraightforward generalization of [1], Lemma 5.4, yields that\n(\u03a0\u03bb \u2297 \u03a3)(A(G))V = H\u03c9 .\nFinally, every irreducible Harish-Chandra module is a subquotient of\nsome V\u03bb \u2297 W (see for example [17], Thm. 4.10), and the claim follows\nby Lemma 5.2.\nLet now (\u03c0, E) be an arbitrary analytic A(G)-tempered globalization\nof V . We aim to prove E \u2243 V min. From Lemma 5.1 we know that V min\ninjects G-equivariantly and continuously into E = E \u03c9 , hence it suffices\nto establish surjectivity of the injection.\nWe now fix the Hilbert globalization H of above. In view of Proposition 5.3 we can embed (\u03c0, E) into a Banach globalization F of V . As\nE is analytic, we obtain a continuous G-equivariant injection E \u2192 F \u03c9 .\nIn order to proceed we recall the Casselman-Wallach theorem (cf. [3],\n[22], or [1] for a more recent proof) which implies that F \u221e is equivalent\nto H\u221e as F-representation. It follows, see Corollary 3.5, that F \u03c9 \u2243 H\u03c9 .\nCollecting the established isomorphisms, we have\nV min \u2192 E \u2282 F \u03c9 \u2243 H\u03c9 \u2243 V min .\nThe surjectivity follows from the completeness of H\u03c9 (see Proposition\n3.7).\nFinally, we prove the case of an arbitrary Harish-Chandra module.\nAs Harish-Chandra modules have finite composition series, it suffices\nto prove the following statement: Let 0 \u2192 V1 \u2192 V \u2192 V2 \u2192 0 be an\nexact sequence of Harish-Chandra modules and suppose that both V1\nand V2 have unique analytic A(G)-tempered globalizations. Then so\ndoes V .\n\n\fANALYTIC REPRESENTATIONS\n\n29\n\nLet E be an analytic A(G)-tempered globalization of V . Let E1\nbe the closure of V1 in E and E2 = E/E1 . Then E1 and E2 are\nanalytic A(G)-tempered globalizations of V1 and V2 . By assumption\nwe get E1 = V1min and E2 = V2min , and from Lemma 5.2 we infer\nV2min = V min /V1min. Observe that in an exact sequence of topological\nvector spaces 0 \u2192 E1 \u2192 E \u2192 E2 \u2192 0 the topology on E is uniquely\ndetermined by the topology of E1 and E2 (see [4], Lemma 1). We thus\nconclude that E = V min .\n\u0003\nWe conclude by summarizing the topological properties of V min . Recall that an inductive limit E = limn\u2192\u221e En of Fr\u00e9chet spaces is called\nregular if every bounded set is contained and bounded in one of the\nsteps En .\nCorollary 5.8. The minimal globalization V min is a nuclear, regular,\nreflexive and complete inductive limit of Fr\u00e9chet\u2013Montel spaces.\nProof. Theorem 5.7 and Proposition 3.7 imply that V min is complete.\nFurthermore, it then follows from [24] and [16] that V min is regular\nand reflexive (see also Appendix B). It is an inductive limit of Fr\u00e9chet\u2013\nMontel spaces, because A(G) is an inductive limit of Fr\u00e9chet\u2013Schwarz\nspaces, and Hausdorff quotients of such spaces are Fr\u00e9chet\u2013Montel.\nNuclearity is inherited from C \u03c9 (M\\K), which is the strong dual of a\nnuclear Fr\u00e9chet space, and this property is preserved when passing to\nthe quotient of a finite dimensional tensor product. Finally, a Fr\u00e9chet\nspace is nuclear if and only if its strong dual is nuclear (see [14], Section\n21.5).\n\u0003\n\n6. Appendix A. Vector-valued holomorphy\nHere we collect some results about analytic functions with values in\na locally convex Hausdorff topological vector space E. Let \u03a9 \u2282 Cn be\nopen.\nIt is a natural and common assumption that E is sequentially complete. Let us recall that under this assumption an E-valued function\nf on \u03a9 is said to be holomorphic if it satisfies one of the following\nconditions, which are equivalent in this case:\n(a) f is weakly holomorphic, that is, the scalar function z 7\u2192 \u03b6(f (z))\nis holomorphic for each continuous linear form \u03b6 \u2208 E \u2032 ;\n(b) f is C-differentiable in each variable at each z \u2208 \u03a9;\n(c) f is infinitely often C-differentiable at each z \u2208 \u03a9;\n\n\f30\n\nGIMPERLEIN, KR\u00d6TZ, AND SCHLICHTKRULL\n\n(d) f is continuous and is represented by a converging power series\nexpansion with coefficients in E, in a neighborhood of each z \u2208 \u03a9.\nIn general, the conditions (c) and (d) are mutually equivalent and\nthey imply (a) and (b). This follows by regarding f as a function into\nthe completion \u0112 of E (see [7], Prop. 2.4). We shall call a function\nf : \u03a9 \u2192 E holomorphic if (c) or (d) is satisfied, or equivalently, if it is\nholomorphic into \u0112 with E-valued derivatives up to all orders.\nLet M be an n-dimensional complex manifold. An E-valued function on M is called holomorphic if all its coordinate expressions are\nholomorphic. We denote by O(M, E) the space of E-valued holomorphic functions on M. Endowed with the compact open topology, it is\na Hausdorff topological vector space, which is complete whenever E is\ncomplete.\nThe following isomorphism of topological vector spaces is useful.\nLemma 6.1. Let M and N be complex manifolds, then\n(6.1)\n\nO(M \u00d7 N, E) \u2243 O(M, O(N, E))\n\nunder the natural map f 7\u2192 (x 7\u2192 f (x, * )) from left to right.\nProof. Apart from the statement that x 7\u2192 f (x, * ) \u2208 O(N, E) is\nholomorphic, this is straightforward from definitions. It is clear that\nf (x, * ) \u2208 O(N, E). By regarding O(N, E) as a subspace of O(N, \u0112)\nand noting that it carries the relative topology, we reduce to the case\nthat E is complete, so that condition (b) applies. Assume for simplicity that M = C. What needs to be established is then only that the\ncomplex differentiation\n\u2202f\n1\n(x, y) = lim [f (x + h, y) \u2212 f (x, y)] \u2208 E\nh\u21920 h\n\u2202x\nis valid locally uniformly with respect to y \u2208 N. This follows from\nuniform continuity on compacta of the derivative.\n\u0003\n\n7. Appendix B. Topological Properties of A(G)\nWhile the topology of a general inductive limit of Fr\u00e9chet spaces may\nbe complicated, A(G) inherits certain properties from the steps A(G)n .\nTheorem 7.1. The algebra A(G) is regular, complete and reflexive.\nA regular inductive limit of Fr\u00e9chet\u2013Montel spaces is known to be\nreflexive [16] and complete [24], so that we only have to show regularity.\nThe following criterion from [24], Theorem 3.3, in terms of interpolation\ninequalities will be convenient:\n\n\fANALYTIC REPRESENTATIONS\n\n31\n\nProposition 7.2. An inductive limit E = limn\u2192\u221e En of Fr\u00e9chetMontel spaces is regular if and only if for some fundamental system\n{pn,\u03bd }\u03bd\u2208N of seminorms on En : \u2200n \u2203m > n \u2203\u03bd \u2200k > m \u2200\u03bc \u2203\u03ba \u2203C \u2200f \u2208\nEn\n(7.1)\n\npm,\u03bc (f ) \u2264 C(pk,\u03ba (f ) + pn,\u03bd (f )) .\n\nIn the case of A(G), condition (7.1) should be thought of as a\nweighted geometric relative of Hadamard's Three Lines Theorem. To\nverify it, we need to introduce some notions from complex and Riemannian geometry, starting with the appropriate differential operators.\nBy common practice we identify the Lie algebra gC with the space of\nright\u2013invariant vector fields on GC , where X \u2208 gC corresponds to the\ndifferential operator\nd\ne\nu(exp(\u2212tX)x) (x \u2208 GC , u \u2208 C \u221e (GC )).\nXu(x)\n=\ndt t=0\nIf we denote the complex structure on the Lie algebra gC by J, the\nCauchy\u2013Riemann operators \u2202 Z and \u2202Z associated to Z \u2208 gC are given\nf resp. \u2202Z := Ze \u2212 iJZ.\nf\nby \u2202 Z := Ze + iJZ\nIn this section it will be convenient to replace the left G-invariant\nmetric g on G used in Section 2.1 by a right invariant one, which we\nshall denote by the same symbol. Note that the corresponding distance\nfunctions d on G are equivalent (see (2.2). The function\n1\n1\nK(exp(JX)g) := |X|2 := g1 (X, X)\n2\n2\nendows a sufficiently small complex neighborhood V G of G with a right\nG\u2013invariant K\u00e4hler structure. To see this, choose an orthonormal basis\n{Xj }lj=1 of g with respect to the metric. A straightforward computation\nresults in\n\u2202Xi \u2202 Xj K(1) = g1 (Xi , Xj ),\nso that the complex Hessian (Z1 , Z2 ) 7\u2192 \u2202Z1 \u2202 Z2 K(1) defines a positive\ndefinite Hermitian form on gC . By continuity and invariance, positivity\nextends to give a K\u00e4hler metric on a small neighborhood V G.\nThe complex Laplacian\n\u2206C =\n\nl\nX\nj=1\n\n\u2202Xj \u2202 Xj =\n\nl\nX\nj=1\n\ngj 2 ,\nfj 2 + JX\nX\n\nagrees with the K\u00e4hler Laplacian up to first\u2013order terms and maps\nreal\u2013valued functions to real\u2013valued functions. Therefore the following\nweak maximum principle holds:\n\n\f32\n\nGIMPERLEIN, KR\u00d6TZ, AND SCHLICHTKRULL\n\nLemma 7.3. If u \u2208 C 2 (V G) is real\u2013valued with a local maximum in\nz \u2208 V G, then\n\u2206C u(z) \u2264 0.\nAs \u2206C is a trace of the complex Hessian, we may rely on well\u2013known\nresults about plurisubharmonic functions to conclude:\nLemma 7.4. For u \u2208 O(V G), \u2206C u = 0 and \u2206C log |u| \u2265 0.\nSo while it may be less obvious how to control applications of \u2206C\nto the Riemannian distance function d on G, \u2206C annihilates the holomorphically regularized distance function d \u0303 := e\u2212\u2206g d from [6]. This\nis going to be useful in the proof of Theorem 7.1, and the following\nLemma, which is shown as in Lemma 4.3 of [6] collects the key prop \u0303\nerties of d.\nLemma 7.5. a) The function d \u0303 extends to a function in O(UG) for\nsome neighborhood U of 1 \u2208 GC .\nfj d \u0303 as well as\nb) For all U \u2032 \u22d0 U, supzg\u2208U \u2032 G |d\u0303(zg) \u2212 d(g)| < \u221e and X\ngj d \u0303 are bounded on U \u2032 G for all j.\nJX\n\nBefore finally coming to the proof of Theorem 7.1, we introduce an\nequivalent representation of A(G) based on geometrically more convenient neighborhoods.

Further we equipped E \u03c9 with an inductive limit topology. We\ncalled a representation (\u03c0, E) analytic if E = E \u03c9 as topological vector\nspaces.\nSome mistakes in the paper have been pointed out by Helge Gl\u00f6ckner\n(see [2]). For a representation (\u03c0, E) and a closed G-invariant subspace\nF of E we asserted in Lemma 3.6 (i) that F \u03c9 = E \u03c9 \u2229F as a topological\nspace. Based on that we further asserted in Lemma 3.6 (ii) that the\ninclusion E \u03c9 /F \u03c9 \u2192 (E/F )\u03c9 is continuous and in Lemma 3.11 that if\n(\u03c0, E) is analytic then so is the restriction to F . However, there is a\ngap in the proof of the first assertion, and presently it is not clear to\nus whether the above statements are then true in this generality (for\nunitary representations (\u03c0, E) they are straightforward). Our proof\ndoes give the following weaker version of the two lemmas:\nLemma 1. Let (\u03c0, E) be a representation, and let F \u2282 E be a closed\ninvariant subspace. Then\n(i) F \u03c9 = E \u03c9 \u2229 F as vector spaces and with continuous inclusion\nF \u03c9 \u2192 E\u03c9.\n(ii) E \u03c9 /E \u03c9 \u2229 F \u2282 (E/F )\u03c9 continuously.\n(iii) If (\u03c0, E) is an analytic representation, then \u03c0 induces an analytic representation on E/F .\nIndeed, for (iii) note that if E is analytic, E/F = E \u03c9 /E \u03c9 \u2229 F \u2282\n(E/F )\u03c9 continuously by (ii), and (E/F )\u03c9 \u2282 E/F continuously.\nFurther we asserted in Proposition 3.7 a general completeness property of the functor which associates E \u03c9 to E. However, there is a gap\nin the proof, which asserts that vi \u2192 v in the topology of E \u03c9 . As\nstatements in this generality are not needed for the main result, we\ncan leave out the proposition (together with Remark 3.8).\nAttached to G we introduced a certain analytic convolution algebra\nA(G). A central theme of the paper is the relation of analytic representations of G to algebra representations of A(G) on E: A(G) \u00d7 E \u2192 E.\nIn Proposition 4.2 (ii) we claimed that the bilinear map A(G)\u00d7A(G) \u2192\nA(G) is continuous. However, the proof shows only separate continuity.\nFor a similar reason we need to weaken Proposition 4.6 to:\nProposition 2. Let (\u03c0, E) be an F-representation. The assignment\nZ\n(f, v) 7\u2192 \u03a0(f )v :=\nf (g)\u03c0(g)v dg\nG\n\n\fANALYTIC REPRESENTATIONS\n\n3\n\ndefines a continuous bilinear map\nAn (G) \u00d7 E \u2192 En\nfor every n \u2208 N, and a separately continuous map\nA(G) \u00d7 E \u2192 E \u03c9\n(with convergence of the defining integral in E \u03c9 ). Moreover, if (\u03c0, E)\nis a Banach representation, then the latter bilinear map is continuous.\nProof. The first statement is proved in the article, and thus only the\nstatement for \u03c0 a Banach representation remains to be proved. We\nrepeat the first part of the proof, now with p denoting the fixed norm\nof E. The constants c, C such that\np(\u03c0(g)v) \u2264 Cecd(g) p(v)\nand N, C1 such that\nC1 :=\n\nZ\n\n(g \u2208 G, v \u2208 E)\n\ne(c\u2212N )d(g) dg < \u221e,\nG\n\nare then all fixed, and so is \u01eb = 1/(CC1 ).\nLet n \u2208 N and an open 0-neighborhood Wn \u2282 En be given. We may\nassume\nWn = {v \u2208 En | p(\u03c0(Kn )v) < \u01ebn }\nwith Kn \u2282 GVn compact and \u01ebn > 0. Let\nOn := {f \u2208 \u00d8(Vn G) |\n\nsup\n\n|f (z \u22121 g)|eN d(g) < \u01eb\u01ebn } \u2282 An (G).\n\nz\u2208Kn ,g\u2208G\n\nThe computation in the given proof shows that if f \u2208 On and p(v) < 1\nthen \u03a0(f )v \u2208 Wn . The asserted bi-continuity of A(G) \u00d7 E \u2192 E \u03c9\nfollows.\n\u0003\nAs a consequence we obtain as in Example 4.10(a), but only for Banach representations (\u03c0, E), that E \u03c9 is A(G)-tempered. In particular\nA(G) need not itself be A(G)-tempered, and we need to replace Lemma\n5.1(i) by the following weaker version:\nLemma 3. V min is an analytic globalization of V and it carries an\nalgebra action\n(f, v) 7\u2192 \u03a0(f )v,\n\nA(G) \u00d7 V min \u2192 V min,\n\nof A(G), which is separately continuous.\nThe main result of the paper Theorem 5.7, has two statements concerning a Harish-Chandra module V with a globalization E:\n(1) If E is analytic A(G)-tempered then E = V min\n\n\f4\n\nGIMPERLEIN, KR\u00d6TZ, AND SCHLICHTKRULL\n\n(2) If E is an F -globalization then E \u03c9 = V min .\nThe proof, which relied on Lemma 3.11 and Proposition 4.6 respectively, needs to be corrected. The proof of (1) if V is irreducible needs\nno modification. For the general case it can be adjusted as follows.\nLike in the paper, it suffices to consider an exact sequence of Harish\u2013\nChandra modules 0 \u2192 V1 \u2192 V \u2192 V2 \u2192 0, where both V1 and V2 have\nunique analytic A(G)-tempered globalizations. We show that the same\nholds for V .\nLet E1 be the closure of V1 in E and E2 = E/E1 . By Lemma\n1(iii), E2 is an analytic A(G)-tempered globalization of V2 , so that by\nassumption E2 = V2min = A(G)V2 as topological vector spaces.\nIn a first step we prove that E1 = V1min = A(G)V1 as vector spaces.\nFor that we note first that E1 is A(G)-tempered and that V1min \u2282 E1\ncontinuously. Next, by Proposition 5.3 (which holds for any A(G)tempered representation), we may embed E1 \u2282 F1 continuously into\na Banach globalization of F1 of V1 . Moreover, the proof shows that\nthe embedding is compatible with the action by A(G). It follows that\nE1\u03c9 \u2282 F1\u03c9 continuously and as A(G)-modules. Further note that since\nE is analytic, from Lemma 1(i) we also obtain E1\u03c9 = E \u03c9 \u2229 E1 = E1\nas vector spaces. Hence V1min \u2282 E1 \u2282 F1\u03c9 . By assumption V1 has\nunique A(G)-tempered globalization, hence F1\u03c9 \u2243 V1min . Therefore\nV1min \u2282 E1 \u2282 F1\u03c9 \u2243 V1min . As these maps respect the structure as\nA(G)\u2013module, the inclusion is also surjective: V1min = E1 .\nBeing an inductive limit, E1 = F1\u03c9 is an ultrabornological space,\nand V1min is webbed (see the reference in the proof of Proposition 4.6).\nWe conclude from the open mapping theorem that V1min = E1 also as\ntopological vector spaces.\nWith Lemma 5.2 we now have a diagram of topological vector spaces\n0 \u2192 V1min \u2192 V min \u2192 V2min \u2192 0\nk\n\u2193\nk\n0 \u2192 E1 \u2192 E\n\u2192 E2 \u2192 0\nwhere the vertical arrow in the middle signifies the continuous inclusion\nV min = A(G)V \u2282 E, and where the rows are exact. The five\u2013lemma\nimplies V min = E as a vector space, and as in the article we conclude\nfrom [DS79] that this is then a topological identity.\nFinally, for (2) we recall from Corollary 3.5 that (E \u221e )\u03c9 = E \u03c9 . The\nCasselman-Wallach smooth globalization theorem asserts the existence\nof a Banach globalization F of V such that F \u221e = E \u221e and therefore\nF \u03c9 = E \u03c9 . In particular, E \u03c9 is A(G)-tempered by Proposition 2. Now\n(1) applies.\n\n\fANALYTIC REPRESENTATIONS\n\n5\n\nAcknowledgement.
