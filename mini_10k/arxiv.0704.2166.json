Introduction\nOH 231.8+4.2 (hereafter OH 231.8) is a well studied preplanetary nebula (pPN). The central source is a binary system formed by an M9-10 III Mira variable (i.e. an AGB star)\nand a A0 main sequence companion, as revealed by optical\nspectroscopy (see S\u00e1nchez Contreras et al. 2004). This remarkable bipolar nebula shows all the signs of post-AGB evolution:\nfast bipolar outflows with velocities \u223c200\u2013400 km s\u22121 , shockexcited gas and shock-induced chemistry. The distance of this\nsource, \u223c 1500 pc, and the inclination of the bipolar axis with\nrespect to the plane of the sky, \u223c 36\u25e6 , are well known, in particular thanks to measurements of phase lags between the variability of the radiation coming from the two lobes and of the light\npolarization in them (see Bowers & Morris 1984; Kastner et al.\n1992; Shure et al. 1995). The presence of a late-type star in the\ncore of a bipolar post-AGB nebula like OH 231.8 is very unusual since the central stars of pPNe are typically hotter, with\nspectral types from B to K. PNe and pPNe usually present conspicuous departures from spherical symmetry, including e.g.\nSend offprint requests to: J.-F. Desmurs\n\nmultiple lobes and jets. To explain their evolution from spherical AGB envelopes, several models have postulated the presence of dense rings or disks close to the central post-AGB stars\n(see Soker 2002; Frank & Blackman 2004, e.g.). The accretion\nof material from them would drive the post-AGB jets by magnetrocentrifugal launching, in a similar way as in protostars.\nThe interaction of these jets with the AGB envelope give rise to\nshocks that shape and accelerate the pPN lobes. Existing observations reveal the presence of central disks in a few pPNe, but\ntheir limited spatial resolution cannot unveil the very inner regions of the disks that are relevant for the processes mentioned\nabove.\nFrom mid-infrared MIDI observations of OH 231.8,\nMatsuura et al. (2006) show the presence of a compact circumstellar region with an inner radius of 40-50 AU (\u223c35 milliarcsec (mas) at 1.3 kpc). An equatorial torus is observed at distances larger than 1 arcsec, however, no trace of rotation is\nfound at this scale and the gas is known to be in expansion, as\nshown by CO and OH emission data (e.g. Alcolea et al. 2001;\nZijlstra et al. 2001).\n\n\f2\n\nJ.-F. Desmurs et al.: Water vapor and silicon monoxide maser observations in the protoplanetary nebula OH 231.8+4.2\n\nFig. 1. Total intensity map of the H2 O maser, compared with the HS T image of the nebula (taken with the WFPC2, filter\nF791W); accurate astrometry has been performed for the HST image and maser maps. The small square map indicates the\nabsolute position of the SiO maser, and the SiO map reproduces the SiO data by S\u00e1nchez Contreras et al. (2002). Top right\npanels show the composed profile of H2 O maser for the two main regions.\nDue to the late spectral type (T eff \u223c 2500 K) of its AGB\ncentral star, OH 231.8 still shows intense SiO masers, contrarily to what happens in the majority of pPNe. NRAO1 Very\nLong Baseline Array (VLBA) observations of 28 SiO masers in\nOH 231.8, carried out at 7 mm (v=2, J=1\u20130) in April 2000\nrevealed for the first time the structure and kinematics of the\nclose stellar environment in a pPN (S\u00e1nchez Contreras et al.\n2002). The SiO maser emission arises from several compact,\nbright spots forming a structure elongated in the direction perpendicular to the symmetry axis of the nebula. Such a distribution is consistent with an equatorial torus with a radius of\n\u223c 6 AU around the central star. A complex velocity gradient\nwas found along the torus, which suggests rotation and infall\nof material towards the star. Such a distribution is remarkably\ndifferent from that typically found in maps of AGB stars, where\nthe masers form a roughly spherical ring-like chain of spots resulting from tangential maser amplification in a thin, spherical\nshell (Desmurs et al. 2000; Cotton et al. 2004).\nWater vapor masers are very often observed in AGB envelopes. They occur in regions extending between 30 and 70\nAU, therefore, about 5 times larger than the SiO maser shells.\nAlthough, in pPNe, water masers are rarely observed, they have\nbeen detected in OH231.8. VLA maps of the H2 O emission\n1\n\nThe National Radio Astronomy Observatory is a facility of the\nNational Science Foundation operated under cooperative agreement\nby Associated Universities, Inc.\n\nby G\u00f3mez & Rodr\u0131\u0301guez (2001) show it to be coincident in position with the SiO masers, but their resolution (about 1 arcsec) was not enough to resolve its structure, as expected. Here,\nwe present VLBA observations of these masers as well as new\nmaps of the SiO maser emission. In both cases we have been\nable to obtain the absolute position of the spots with great accuracy, and locate them with respect to the other (more extended)\ncomponents of the nebulae.\n\n2. Observations and astrometry\nUsing the VLBA, we performed milliarcsecond resolution observations of the H2 O 61,6 \u201352,3 and SiO (v=1 and v=2, J=1\u2013\n0) maser emission in the pPN OH 231.8. The H2 O and SiO\nobservations were performed on 24th November 2002 and on\n3rd July 2003, respectively. The data were recorded in dual\ncircular polarization with a velocity resolution (i.e. channel\nwidth) of \u223c0.2 km s\u22121 and a total velocity coverage of about\n110 km s\u22121 . To be able to measure the relative position of the\nH2 O and SiO maser spots / clumps part of the observations\nwas made using the phase referencing technique: to ensure\nthe detection of our source, we alternate standard line observations with observations in phase referencing, each observing block lasting 40 minutes. The coordinates are then absolute positions referred to the quasar J0730\u201311. For the correlation of all the observations, we used the coordinates given by\n\n\fJ.-F.

The amplitude was calibrated using the template spectra method. To improve the phase calibration solutions, we extensively mapped all the calibrators, and their\nbrightness distributions were introduced and taken into account\nin the calibration process.\n\n2.1. Relative position of H2 O and SiO emission\nIn order to compare the SiO and the H2 O maser emission, the\nobservations were performed using the phase referencing technique. This means that the antennas were rapidly switched between our source (OH231.8) and our calibrator J0730\u201311 in\nless time than the phase coherence time of the atmosphere at\nthe given frequency (less than 1 minute for the full switching\ncycle). Therefore during the data reduction process, we were\nable to directly apply the phase correction derived from our\nphase calibrator onto OH231.8. (J0730\u201311 was well detected\nat both frequencies with a flux density measured in the resulting maps of 1.44 Jy at 22 GHz, and 1.33 Jy at 43 GHz).\nFor the water maser observations the phase referencing\nworked perfectly and the most intense channel of the autocorrelation spectra (the peak lying at 25.5 km s\u22121 LSR) was\neasily detected and mapped with a signal-to-noise ratio over\n10 \u03c3. The measured absolute position lies at R.A. and Dec\noffsets \u2206(R.A.)=\u2212149 mas and \u2206(Dec.)=+166 mas from the\ncorrelation position. Therefore, the position measured for our\nreference H2 O maser spot is R.A.J2000 = 07h 42m 16.s 91974\nDecJ2000 = \u221214\u25e642\u2032 50.\u2032\u2032 0354.\nThe SiO maser line (v=2, J=1\u20130) was weak at the time\nof the observations, only a few Jy, and the phase referenced\nmap is noisy. The SiO maser profile in our data is composed\n\n3\n\nof three peaks, at about 26, 32 and 40 km s\u22121 LSR, similar to those observed in other epochs in the source, see e.g.\nS\u00e1nchez Contreras et al. (2000, 2002). We were able to map\nthe emission in the most intense channel, the one lying close\nto 27 km s\u22121 LSR, and identified a feature with a flux of\n72.55 mJy i.e. at a level of 4.4 \u03c3 detection. This tentative detection for the SiO maser emission give us an absolute position\nat offsets \u2206(R.A.)=\u2212145 mas and \u2206(Dec.)=+145 mas with respect to the correlation position. The absolute coordinates of\nour reference SiO feature would be: R.A.= 07h 42m 16.s 91994\nDec= \u221214\u25e6 42\u2032 50.\u2032\u2032 0574. This would place the SiO maser emission nearly in the middle of the two groups of water maser spots\n(see Fig. 1). The SiO map shown in Fig. 1 is that obtained by\nS\u00e1nchez Contreras et al. (2002), aligned under the assumption\nthat the position derived by us coincides with the centroid of\ntheir spot distribution. Because of the small size of the SiO\nmaser distribution, the uncertainty of this alignment is in any\ncase very small, less than about 3 mas.\nIn order to locate the SiO and H2 O maser spots in the HST\nimage of the nebula, we improved the astrometry of the HST\nimages published by some of us (Bujarrabal et al. 2002). In that\npaper, the registering of the images was done with IRAF using the \"STSDAS\" task \"metric\" by comparing the positions\nof 28 stars in the FWPC2 chips listed in the Guide Star Catalog\n2.2 with those retrieved by the task. We concluded that, after corrections, the positions of the plates where accurate up\nto 0.2 arcsec. Since then, the Second U.S. Naval Observatory\nCCD Astrograph Catalog (Zacharias et al. 2004) has been released. We have 9 stars in the 4 FWPC2 chips listed in this catalog with position errors of about 0.02 arcsec. or less. We have\ncompared these nominal positions with those derived with the\ntask \"metric\" obtaining mean errors (measured \u2013 nominal) of\n\u22120.\u2032\u2032 81 to the east (\u22120.056 sec. of time in R.A.) and \u22120.\u2032\u2032 43 in\nDec, with rms of 0.\u2032\u2032 12 and 0.\u2032\u2032 054 respectively (fully consistent with the values of \u22120.\u2032\u2032 6 \u00b1 0.\u2032\u2032 2 and \u22120.\u2032\u2032 5 \u00b1 0.\u2032\u2032 2 obtained by\nBujarrabal et al. 2002). Using these corrections we have ploted\nthe location of both maser emissions on the HST plate shown\nin Fig. 1.\n\n3. Results and discussion\nIn Table 1 we summarise our H2 O observational results.\nColumn 2 and 3 give the offset in mas of each maser spot respectively to the reference maser spot. This reference maser\nwas used to derive the fringe rate corrections, and is the one for\nwhich we measured the absolute position with respect to the\nquasar. The three last columns give the values obtained from\nGauss fit of each maser spot, central velocity, peak flux intensities, and the full linewidth at half peak intensity.\nThe H2 O maser integrated flux map is shown in Fig. 1.\nThe restored clean beam has a full width at half maximum of\nabout \u223c 1.5 x 0.75 mas, and is oriented with a position angle\nof PA = \u22125\u25e6 . Maser emission has been searched for a large\narea of up to 900 mas. Maps have been cleaned down to a\nnoise level of 30 mJy/beam. Maser emission arises from several compact spots distributed in mainly two areas, separated by\nabout 60 mas, in approximately the north-south direction, corresponding to the two spectral features appearing on the auto\n\n\f4\n\nJ.-F. Desmurs et al.: Water vapor and silicon monoxide maser observations in the protoplanetary nebula OH 231.8+4.2\n\nand cross correlation spectra (note that we also found an isolated maser spot at a few tenths of mas to the west). The northern area correspond to the blue-shifted emission and the southern to the red-shifted one. Our SiO observations indicate that\nthe SiO masers arise from a region placed approximately in the\nmiddle of both H2 O maser-emitting areas (see Fig. 1), probably\npinpointing the location of the central Mira component of the\ncentral stellar system.\nThe size of the water maser regions around AGB stars\nvaries between \u223c 5 1014 and 2 1015 cm (e.g. Colomer et al.\n2000; Bains et al. 2003), occupying the circumstellar region in\nwhich the expansion velocity is already high but probably has\nnot yet reached its final value (around 8\u201310 km s\u22121 ). The distribution of the maser spots in some objects (IRC +60169, U Her,\nIK Tau, RT Vir, ...), is rounded and consistent with the maser\nemission arising in a thick expanding shell. In other objects, the\ndistribution of the maser spot is more chaotic.\nIt is thought that, at a distance of a few 1014 cm from the\nAGB star, the temperature (500 \u2013 1000 K) and densities (5 107\n\u2013 109 cm\u22123 , for standard mass-loss rates between \u223c 10\u22126 and\n10\u22125 M\u2299 yr\u22121 ) are adequate to produce strong H2 O maser emission (see model predictions by e.g. Cooke & Elitzur 1985).\nWater abundances in these layers are still high, more or less\nequal to those given by thermal equilibrium.\nAs we have seen, the size of the total emitting region in\nOH 231.8, \u223c 1015 cm, is very compatible with that in standard\nred giants. Also the spot relative velocity, requiring a deprojected expansion velocity of 10 - 15 km s\u22121 (for an axis inclination of about 36\u25e6 with respect to the plane of the sky, Sect. 1),\nis compatible with the usual velocities found in AGB stars (e.g.\nLoup et al. 1993; Te Lintel Hekkert et al. 1989). However, we\nnote that the total velocity dispersion in our data (\u223c 20 km s\u22121 )\nis larger than those found in the majority of H2 O profiles\nfrom AGB stars (see e.g. Engels & Lewis 1996; Engels 2002;\nColomer et al. 2000; Bains et al. 2003).\nTherefore, from the point of view of the pumping conditions and kinematics, the H2 O emission in our object comes\nfrom a region that we can assume to be typical of water masers\nin AGB stars. No special phenomena (shocks, photo induced\nchemistry, ...) are then necesarily required to explain our observations, just the usual physical and chemical conditions in\nthe envelope of a O-rich AGB star.\nThe bipolar spatial distribution of H2 O masers in OH 231.8\nis, however, peculiar. Instead of a circular distribution around\nthe central star, we find two spot sets. The fact that the SiO\nmaser emission comes from a region in the middle of the H2 O\nspot areas confirms that they are placed at both sides of the star,\nalong the axis of the nebula. This distribution strongly suggests\nthat the equatorial regions of the inner circumstellar envelope\nof OH 231.8 have been strongly modified, probably by the presence of a companion, and are now not able to harbor water\nvapor masers. Running simple modeling of water maser excitation (see Soria-Ruiz et al. 2004), it appears that water masers\ncan be easily quenched: a modification by a factor of 2 of the\nradius of the emission (this corresponds to a factor 4 in density)\nproduces intensity drop of the maser by one order of magnitude.\n\nBased on its broad OH maser emission profile, OH231.8\nhas been suggested to be a \"water-fountain\" cousin (e.g.\nLikkel et al. 1992). \"Water-fountain\" sources are a special class\nof rare post-AGB stars with very high velocity outflows traced\nby OH or H2 O masers or both. So far there are only four objects\nin this group, namely: IRAS 16342-3814, IRAS 19134+2131,\nW43A (e.g. Likkel et al. 1992), and the most recently discovered OH 12.8-0.9 (Boboltz & Marvel 2005). The expansion velocities of the outflows implied by the H2 O maser emission in\nthese objects (except for OH 12.8 - see below), Vexp = 100 \u2013\n300 km s\u22121 , are one order of magnitude larger than the typical shell expansion velocity of mass-losing evolved stars (see\nabove). Another characteristic of water fountain sources is that\nthe expansion velocity derived from H2 O is higher than that\ndeduced from the OH maser emission. This implies that the\nlocation of the masers in these objects deviates from the prototypical maser stratification in AGB envelopes, where the SiO,\nH2 O, and OH masers arise in different shell layers located at\nprogressively further distances from the star, expanding also\nat progressively higher velocities. As revealed by recent highangular resolution observations, the spatial structure of the H2 O\nmasers in water-fountain sources is indeed peculiar: the masers\nare occur in collimated winds or jets, aligned with the symmetry axis of the nebulae (e.g. Imai et al. 2004; Boboltz & Marvel\n2005). These maser spots are located at distances that range\nbetween 870 AU and 600 AU from the central star, i.e. much\nfarther away than H2 O masers in OH/IR stars (typically at 40\n- 70 AU) and therefore, shock-compression and heating is required to explain the fast maser spots at these distances: the\nmaser emission would be located in an area of shocked gas,\nin the region where the post-AGB jets interact with the fossil\nAGB envelope.\nAlthough the nebular geometry model (equatorial disk +\npolar stream) proposed to explain water-fountain sources probably applies to OH231.8 to some extent, the H2 O maser emission in OH231.8 is remarkably different from that found in\nwater-fountain objects (see above). A few other pPNe show\nH2 O emission with low-velocity spots, more similar to that\nobserved in our source (de Gregorio-Monsalvo et al. 2004).\nAlthough the interpretation of the origin of the H2 O emission in\nthem is not straightforward, it seems to come from nebular regions that have not been accelerated during the post-AGB evolution. In particular, the expansion velocity of the H2 O masers\nis very low compared to pPN bipolar jets. Moreover, the H2 O\nemission is not as well collimated as in water-fountains. As\na consequence, shocks effects (expected to be responsible for\nthe pPNe bipolar outflows) are not required to explain the H2 O\nmaser emission in OH231.8, which is observed at only \u223c 40\nAU from the central star, as in normal AGB envelopes, and expanding at low velocity, lower than that of the OH maser spots.\nWe cannot rule out that the H2 O maser spots of OH231.8\nare placed at the base of a bipolar outflow, whose very fast, extended components are detected in scattered light and CO line\nemission. In this case, the masers would lie there because a\nbipolar ejection of material has yielded two opposite condensations with suitable conditions to form H2 O masers. But, as\ndiscussed above, the properties of water vapor masers in our\nsource are very different from those of maser associated with\n\n\fJ.-F. Desmurs et al.: Water vapor and silicon monoxide maser observations in the protoplanetary nebula OH 231.8+4.2\n\nbipolar outflows in pPNe. In fact, they resemble those of H2 O\nmasers associated with AGB stars. We also note that if the H2 O\nmasers are tracing a bipolar outflow, this would be expected to\nbe centered around the compact companion of the binary system, which is most likely to power the jets in this case (e.g.\nS\u00e1nchez Contreras et al. 2004), and not around the mass-losing\nstar, i.e. the Mira, as we observe.\nIn summary, in view of their spatial distribution and kinematics, the maser spots in OH 231.8 seem to be the result of\na pumping process very similar to that at work in AGB circumstellar envelopes, and under similar physical and chemical\nconditions. But they take place in an envelope that has been seriously altered, probably due to the presence of a companion,\nin such a way that only (unshocked) polar regions of the envelope keep favorable conditions for H2 O maser pumping. The\nfact that the SiO maser region is much smaller than the H2 O\nregion and perpendicular to its distribution, probably indicates\nthat gravitational/tidal forces due to the companion strongly affect these inner circumstellar shells, supporting our conclusion\non its effects on the H2 O emitting region.\n\nReferences\nAlcolea, J., Bujarrabal, V., S\u00e1nchez Contreras, C., Neri, R., &\nZweigle, J. 2001, A&A, 373, 932\nBains, I., Cohen, R.
