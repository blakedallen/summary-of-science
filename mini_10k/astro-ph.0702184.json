There are two kinds of objects to consider with\nregard to the rotation of galaxy clusters: intracluster medium (ICM) and the galaxies.\nFor ICM, recent studies have searched for the bulk motion or the velocity gradient of\nICM in several clusters using ASCA and Chandra data. Dupke & Bregman (2001a,b) directly\ndetected, for the first time, ICM bulk motions in the outer regions of the Centaurus (Abell\n3526) and the Perseus (Abell 426) clusters using ASCA data. Later, Dupke & Bregman\n(2005) identified two more clusters (Abell 576 and RX J0419.5+0225) that have the most\nsignificant velocity gradients among 12 clusters for which velocity mapping could be performed with useful precision in the ASCA archive. Recently, Dupke & Bregman (2006)\nmeasured the velocity difference of (2.4\u00b11.0)\u00d7103 km s\u22121 for the regions opposed around\nthe center of ICM in the Centaurus cluster using Chandra data. If this velocity difference is\ndue to the gas circulation around the cluster center, then the corresponding circular velocity\nwill be as large as (1.2\u00b10.7)\u00d7103 km s\u22121 .\nFor the galaxies in clusters, the global velocity gradient suggestive of cluster rotation has\nbeen detected in some clusters (Materne & Hopp 1983; Biviano et al. 1996; den Hartog & Katgert\n1996; Burgett et al. 2004). den Hartog & Katgert (1996) found that 13 clusters show significant velocity gradients in the range of 240\u22121230 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 among 72 clusters.\nBurgett et al. (2004) reported that three clusters (Abell 1139, Abell 1663, and Abell S333)\nexhibit velocity-position characteristics consistent with the presence of possible cluster rotation, shear, or infall dynamics. Up to now, there is only one galaxy cluster of which global\nrotation of galaxies was studied in detail: Abell 2107. Oegerle & Hill (1992) found from\nthe analysis of 75 member galaxies that Abell 2107 appears to be a regular cluster (single\npeaked galaxy distribution, regular X-ray morphology, and Gaussian velocity histogram),\nbut has spatially correlated velocities of galaxies (high and low velocity galaxies are segregated spatially). They concluded that the spatial distribution of galaxy velocity is consistent\nwith a rotation of a single cluster at 98 % confidence level. Recently, Kalinkov et al. (2005)\nsuggested that the virial mass of Abell 2107 determined in their study, should be reduced\nfrom (3.2\u00b10.6)\u00d71014 M\u2299 to (2.8\u00b10.5)\u00d71014 M\u2299 due to the correction for the cluster rotation.\nTheoretically, a galaxy cluster is expected to acquire angular momentum through an\noff-axis merging or a global rotation of the universe. First, off-axis merging between two\nclusters is expected to provide angular momentum to the clusters, resulting in rotating\nclusters (Ricker 1998; Takizawa 2000; Ricker & Sarazin 2001; Pawl et al. 2005). According\nto off-axis merging models, the global rotation of \"collisional\" ICM originated by merging\n\n\f\u20133\u2013\nsurvives longer than that of \"collisionless\" galaxies in clusters (Roettiger & Flores 2000).\nTherefore, it is expected that it is more difficult to detect the global rotation of galaxies than\nthat of ICM. Secondly, the global rotation of the universe may provide angular momentum\nto the celestial bodies on their formation, resulting in rotating systems (Li 1998). Li model\nexplains the empirical relation between the angular momenta and the masses of galaxies.\nLater, Godlowski et al. (2003) showed that Li model predicts the presence of a minimum\n(i.e. vanishing angular momentum) in the relation between the angular momenta and the\nmasses of celestial bodies. Their prediction was observationally tested by Godlowski et al.\n(2005); vanishing angular momenta for the masses corresponding to the galaxy groups and\nnon-vanshing angular momenta for smaller and larger structures (compact groups and rich\ngalaxy clusters). However, the non-vanishing angular momenta for galaxy clusters were\nfound indirectly based on the study of the galaxy orientation. Therefore, it is needed to\nprobe the angular momenta of galaxy clusters directly based on dynamical analysis.\nRecently, galaxy redshift surveys such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS, York et al.\n2000) and the 2dF Galaxy Redshift Survey (2dFGRS, Colless et al. 2001) have provided\nredshift data for large samples of galaxies. Therefore, by identifying member galaxies in\nclusters using the redshift and the positional data, we can search for the global rotation of\ngalaxies in clusters for a large sample of galaxy clusters in these data.\nIn this paper, we present a result of searching for galaxy clusters that show an indication\nof global rotation using a spectroscopic sample of galaxies in SDSS and 2dFGRS. Section 2\ndescribes the galaxy sample and the cluster sample. The algorithm for identifying tentative\nrotating clusters and the results are presented in Section 3. Analysis of the cluster morphology and of the substructure for tentative rotating clusters is given in Section 4. A detailed\nanalysis of the individual clusters is presented in Section 5. We discuss the properties of\nthe probable rotating clusters in Section 6. A summary of this study is given in the final\nsection. Throughout this paper, we adopt cosmological parameters h = 0.7, \u03a9\u039b = 0.7, and\n\u03a9M = 0.3.\n\n2.\n\nData\n\nWe used the data for the spectroscopic sample of galaxies in the Fifth Data Release of\nSDSS1 , and in the Final Data Release of 2dFGRS (Colless et al. 2001).\nThe SDSS Data Release 5 contains five-band (u, g, r, i, z) photometric data for 215\n1\n\nThe details of Data Release 5 can be found on the SDSS web site (http://www.sdss.org/dr5/).\n\n\f\u20134\u2013\nmillion objects over 8,000 deg2 , and optical spectroscopic data for one million objects of\ngalaxies, quasars, and stars over 5,740 deg2 . We used the spectroscopic sample of 674,000\ngalaxies for this study. The median redshift for the spectroscopic sample of galaxies is 0.11.\nThe redshifts were measured from the spectra covering 3800\u22129200 \u00c5 with an uncertainty\nof \u223c30 km s\u22121 . The redshift confidence parameter (zConf) was assigned from 0 to 1 in the\nSDSS catalogs. We used only the galaxies with zConf \u2265 0.65.\nThe 2dFGRS contains the spectra for 246,000 galaxies selected in the photographic bJ\nband from the APM galaxy catalog. The survey covers over 2,000 deg2 and, the median\nredshift for the sample of galaxies is similar to that of SDSS. The redshift measurements\nwere done from the spectra covering 3600\u22128000 \u00c5, and the redshift quality parameter Q\nwas assigned in the range of 1\u22125. The redshift measurements with Q\u22653 are 98.4 % reliable,\nand have an overall rms uncertainty of \u223c85 km s\u22121 . We used only the galaxies with Q \u2265 3\nin this study.\nSince some galaxies were covered in both SDSS and 2dFGRS, we matched the galaxies\nfound in SDSS with those in 2dFGRS to make a master catalog of galaxies. The mean\ndifference of radial velocities between the measurements of SDSS and 2dFGRS for 31,300\nmatched galaxies is \u2206v(= vSDSS \u2212 v2dFGRS ) \u223c13 km s\u22121 . We corrected the velocities of\ngalaxies in SDSS by the mean difference of radial velocities, and used the average value of\nthe velocities measured in SDSS and in 2dFGRS for further analysis.\nWe used the Abell catalog of galaxy clusters (Abell, Corwin & Olowin 1989) to find the\nclusters in the survey data. Among the Abell clusters, we selected the clusters that have\nknown spectroscopic redshifts in NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED). Finally, we\nselected 899 clusters located within the survey regions of SDSS and 2dFGRS as a sample of\nclusters for further analysis.\n\n3.\n\nIdentification of rotating cluster candidates\n\nWe applied the following procedure to identify the rotating cluster candidates in SDSS\nand 2dFGRS:\n1. In order to select the member galaxies in the target clusters, we used \"shifting gapper\"\nmethod of Fadda et al. (1996). In the plot of radial velocity versus clustercentric\ndistance of galaxies for a given cluster, we selected the galaxies as cluster members\nusing a velocity gap of 950 km s\u22121 and a distance bin of 0.2 Mpc shifting along the\nclustercentric distance from the cluster center. We used a larger bin width if the number\nof galaxies in a bin is less than 15. We applied the method to the galaxies within the\n\n\f\u20135\u2013\nradius at which the distance between adjacent galaxies is larger than 0.1 Mpc. We\niterated the procedure until the number of cluster members becomes stable. Finally,\nwe selected 56 galaxy clusters in which the number of member galaxies is greater than\nor equal to 40 for further analysis.\n2. To investigate the global rotational property of galaxy clusters, we fit the observed\nradial velocities vp of the cluster galaxies with a function of a position angle,\nvp (\u0398) = vsys + vrot sin(\u0398 \u2212 \u03980 ) ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u0398 is the projected position angle of a galaxy relative to the cluster center (measured from North to East), \u03980 is the projected position angle of the rotation axis of the\ncluster, vrot is the rotation amplitude, and vsys is the systemic velocity of the galaxy\ncluster.\nSimilarly, the effect of the global rotation of galaxy clusters can appear as a velocity\ngradient across the cluster. To investigate the global velocity gradient, we fit the\nobserved radial velocities of the cluster galaxies with a function of a position in the\nplane of the sky,\nvp (X, Y ) = vsys +\n\n\u2202v\n\u2202v\nX+\nY,\n\u2202X\n\u2202Y\n\n(2)\n\nwhere X and Y are clustercentric distances in the direction of right ascension and\ndeclination, respectively. We fit the observed radial velocities of cluster galaxies using\nequation (1) and (2) with vsys as a fixed value of the mean radial velocity of cluster\ngalaxies (the biweight location of Beers et al. 1990).\nIn Figure 1, we plot the velocity dispersions (the biweight scale of Beers et al. 1990)\nof galaxy clusters as a function of |vrot | /\u03c3p , the ratio of absolute value of the rotation amplitude to the velocity dispersion (Left panel), and as a function of dv/dR(\u2261\np\n(\u2202v/\u2202X)2 + (\u2202v/\u2202Y )2 ), the global velocity gradient (Right panel). Figure 1 shows\nthat there are four clusters (A1035, A1373, A2034, and A4053) of which velocity dispersions are unusually large (> 1300 km s\u22121 ), while the majority of clusters are in the\nrange of 290 km s\u22121 < \u03c3p < 1050 km s\u22121 . Large velocity dispersions of these four\nclusters might be related to the two superimposed or interacting clusters with slightly\ndifferent systemic velocities (to be discussed in Section 5).\nIt is expected that a rotating cluster has a large ratio of the absolute value of rotation\namplitude to the velocity dispersion, and has a large global velocity gradient across\nthe cluster. Therefore, among the selected 56 galaxy clusters, we selected 12 tentative\n\n\f\u20136\u2013\nrotating clusters of which the ratios of the absolute value of rotation amplitude to\nthe velocity dispersion are greater than 0.53, and the global velocity gradients are\ngreater than 380 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 . We chose these critical values of |vrot | /\u03c3p = 0.53\nand dv/dR = 380 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 because the rotation amplitudes of the clusters above\nthese values are significant above \u223c 2\u03c3 level. In addition, the dips are seen at the\ncritical values in both Figure 1 (c) and (d), implying that a segregation between the\nrotating and non-rotating clusters might exist, although it is not known whether there\nis a discrete boundary of the rotation amplitude between the rotating and non-rotating\nclusters or not. These selection criteria are represented by dotted vertical lines in Figure\n1. In comparison, we plot the data of Abell 2107 (star symbol) that is known to be a\nprobable rotating cluster (Oegerle & Hill 1992; Kalinkov et al. 2005). It is found that\nAbell 2107 also satisfies our selection criteria for tentative rotating clusters.\nTable 1 lists the tentative rotating clusters with Abell identification, RA and Dec\n(J2000), Bautz-Morgan (BM) type, the redshift derived in this study, the velocity dispersion\nderived in this study, the number of member galaxies, X-ray luminosity, and the reference\nfor the X-ray luminosity. The sample of tentative rotating clusters are found from z = 0.028\nto z = 0.125, and have 41\u2212122 member galaxies. There are seven clusters of which X-ray\nluminosities are estimated, and six clusters of which Bautz-Morgan types are III.\nThe rotational properties derived using equation (1) and (2) are summarized in Table 2.\nThe first column gives the Abell identification. The second and the third columns represent,\nrespectively, the position angle of rotation axis and the rotation amplitude derived using\nequation (1). The ratio of the absolute value of rotation amplitude to the velocity dispersion,\n|vrot | /\u03c3p , is shown in the fourth column. The fifth column gives the position angle that is\ndefined by \u03981 =tan\u22121 [(\u2202v/\u2202Y )/(\u2202v/\u2202X)] \u2212 \u03c0/2. The final column gives the global velocity\ngradient derived using equation (2). The uncertainties of these values represent 68% (1\u03c3)\nconfidence intervals. We compute the uncertainties using 1000 artificial data set constructed\nby choosing randomly cluster galaxies up to the number of cluster members in real data.\nThe fitting procedure is done using 1000 trial data sets, the results are sorted, and the\nvalues corresponding to the 16th and the 84th percentiles are identified. The uncertainties\nare defined as the offsets between these values and the values computed using the real data.\nIn Table 2, there are two clusters (A1035 and A1373) that have unusually large rotation\namplitudes (> 1300 km s\u22121 ) and velocity gradients (> 1900 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 ) due to the\nsuperimposed two disparate groups (to be discussed in Section 5). Other ten clusters show\nrotation amplitudes in the range of 190 km s\u22121 < vrot < 830 km s \u22121 , and velocity gradients\nin the range of 400 km s\u22121 Mpc \u22121 < dv/dR < 1080 km s \u22121 Mpc \u22121 .\n\n\f\u20137\u2013\nFigure 2 shows the plot of radial velocity versus clustercentric distance of galaxies and\nthe velocity distribution for 12 tentative rotating clusters. In Figure 3, we show the spatial\ndistribution of cluster galaxies with the measured velocities. Most clusters show that the\ngalaxies of which velocities are greater than the systemic velocity of the cluster (open circles)\nand the galaxies of which velocities are less than the systemic velocity of the cluster (filled\ncircles) are spatially separated well by the rotation axis (Y1 or Y2). Interestingly, the\nposition angles of the rotation axes, Y1 (determined from equation (1)) and Y2 (determined\nfrom equation (2)), coincide well (the difference of position angles between Y1 and Y2 is less\nthan 20 degree) except for three clusters (S0001, A1399, and A2169).\nWe plot the radial velocities as a function of a projected distance along the direction\nperpendicular to the position angle (\u03980 ) of the rotation axis (Y1) in Figure 4 which is\navailable only in electronic issue. The velocity gradients along the X1 axis are marginally\nseen in some clusters (A1035, A1373, A1474, and A2162), while those are not clearly seen\nin the other clusters.\n\n4.\n\nGlobal Cluster Properties\n4.1.\n\nCluster Morphology\n\nIn order to identify the connection between the cluster morphology and the cluster\ndynamics, it is useful to determine the ellipticity and the orientation of a cluster using a\nspatial distribution of the selected member galaxies. To determine the cluster shape, we use\nthe method of the dispersion ellipse of the bivariate normal frequency function of position\nvectors (e.g. Trumpler & Weaver 1953; Carter & Metcalfe 1980; Burgett et al. 2004). The\ndispersion ellipse is defined in Trumpler & Weaver (1953) as the contour at which the density\nis 0.61 times the maximum density of a set of points distributed normally with respect to\ntwo correlated variables, although the points need not be distributed normally in order to\ndetermine the proper cluster shape. From the first five moments of the spatial distribution,\n\n\u03bc10\n\n\u03bc01\n\n\u03bc20\n\nN\n1 X\n=\nXi\nN i=1\nN\n1 X\nYi\n=\nN i=1\n\nN\n1 X 2\n=\nX \u2212\nN i=1 i\n\nN\n1 X\nXi\nN i=1\n\n(3a)\n\n(3b)\n!2\n\n(3c)\n\n\f\u20138\u2013\nN\nN\nN\n1 X\n1 X X\n\u03bc11 =\nXi Y i \u2212 2\nXi\nYi\nN i=1\nN i=1\ni=1\n!2\nN\nN\n1 X\n1 X 2\nY \u2212\nYi\n,\n\u03bc02 =\nN i=1 i\nN i=1\n\n(3d)\n\n(3e)\n\nwhere X and Y are clustercentric distances in the direction of right ascension and declination, respectively. The semi-major and minor axes of the ellipse, \u0393A and \u0393B , are derived\nby solving the equation of\n\u03bc20 \u2212 \u03932\n\u03bc11\n=0 .\n(4)\n\u03bc11\n\u03bc02 \u2212 \u03932\nThe position angle of the major axis measured from north to east is given by\n\u0012\n\u0013\n\u03bc02 \u2212 \u03932A\n\u03c0\n\u22121\n\u2212\n\u03982 = cot\n+\n,\n\u03bc11\n2\nand the ellipticity is defined by\n\u01eb=1\u2212\n\n\u0393B\n.\n\u0393A\n\n(5)\n\n(6)\n\nThe major/minor axis, position angle, and ellipticity for our tentative rotating clusters\nthat we derived are listed in Table 3. Interestingly, the ellipticities of S0001 (\u01eb =0.52) and\nA1399 (\u01eb =0.57) are unusually larger than those of other clusters. However, the ellipticity\nof S0001 might be uncertain because no data are available for \u223c 30\u2032 away to the North from\nthe S0001 center as seen in Figure 3.\n\n4.2.\n\nAnalysis of Substructure\n\nThe analysis of substructure is a useful diagnostic tool for understanding of the dynamical state of galaxy clusters. A useful discussion for several substructure tests is given in\nPinkney et al. (1996). We have derived a number density map using the spatial position\n(2D) of member galaxies, and performed 1D and 3D substructure tests for the sample of\ntentative rotating clusters.\nThe majority of 1D (velocity histogram) substructure tests are normality tests. We\npresent the results of five 1D tests for tentative rotating clusters in Table 4. The values of\nI test (Teague et al. 1990) are shown in the first and the second column. I90 is the critical\nvalue for rejecting the Gaussian hypothesis at 90 % confidence level. Therefore, a velocity\n\n\f\u20139\u2013\ndistribution is considered to be a non-Gaussian if I > I90 . It is found that all clusters satisfy\nthe Gaussian hypothesis using the I test except for S1171 and A4053.\nThe skewness that is a measure of the degree of asymmetry of a distribution, and\nits confidence level of rejecting normality are given in the third and the fourth columns.\nPositive (Negative) skewness indicates that the distribution is skewed to the right (left),\nwith a longer tail to the right (left) of the distribution maximum. The kurtosis that is the\ndegree of peakedness of a distribution and its confidence level of rejecting normality are given\nin the fifth and the sixth columns. Positive values of the kurtosis indicate pointed or peaked\ndistributions, while negative values flattened or non-peaked distributions. The skewness test\nrejects a Gaussian distribution with a confidence level of > 99% for only S1171 and A4053,\nbeing consistent with the result of I test. The kurtosis test rejects a Gaussian hypothesis of\nA1035, A1373, A1474, and A2162 with a confidence level of > 95%.\nFrom the seventh to the tenth column, we present the Asymmetry Index (AI) and the\nTail Index (TI) introduced by Bird & Beers (1993) with their confidence levels. The AI\nmeasures the symmetry in a population by comparing gaps in the data on the left and right\nsides of the sample median, and TI compares the spread of the data at 90 % level to the\nspread at the 75 % level. The Gaussian hypothesis for A1035 and A1474 are rejected by\nboth AI and TI tests with a confidence level of > 95%.\nWe have constructed the number density contours for the clusters using a different bin\n\u221a\nsize of 0.25R \u00d7 0.25R (Mpc)2 depending on the cluster size (R = 4 \u0393A \u0393B /1.5). \u0393A and\n\u0393B are used in the unit of Mpc, 4 is an arbitrary constant, and 1.5 (Mpc) is normalizing\nconstant. We have smoothed the contours using a cubic convolution interpolation method.\nThe contour interval, (the maximum density in a cluster)/6, is also determined according to\nthe maximum number density of the clusters. We plot the number density map in the first\nand the third columns in Figure 5.\nUsing the velocity data and positional information of galaxies, we have performed \u2206 test\n(Dressler & Shectman 1988) that computes the local deviations from the systemic velocity\n(vsys ) and dispersion (\u03c3p ) of the entire cluster. For each galaxy, the deviation is defined by\n\u03b42 =\n\n\u0003\nNnn \u0002\n2\n2\n(v\n\u2212\nv\n)\n+\n(\u03c3\n\u2212\n\u03c3\n)\n,\nlocal\nsys\nlocal\np\n\u03c3p2\n\n(7)\n\nwhere Nnn is the number of galaxies that defines the local environment, taken to be\np\n\u223c Ngal in this study. The sum of \u03b4 over all cluster galaxies in a cluster, \u2206, is used to\nquantify the presence of substructures. It is approximately equal to the total number of\ngalaxies in a cluster in the case of no substructure, while it is larger in the presence of\n\n\f\u2013 10 \u2013\nsubstructure.\nThe statistical significance of the deviation is computed by Monte Carlo simulation.\nThe velocities are randomly assigned to the galaxies at the observed galaxy positions, and\n\u2206sim is computed for each simulated cluster. We construct 1000 simulated clusters and\ncompute \u2206sim for each simulation. We present \u2206obs which is computed using real data and\nthe fraction of simulated clusters with \u2206sim > \u2206obs in the final two columns of Table 4. Small\nvalues of f (\u2206sim > \u2206obs ) indicate the statistically significant substructure in clusters. Most\nclusters have small values of f (\u2206sim > \u2206obs ), indicating significant substructures or spatially\ncorrelated velocities of galaxies except for S1171, A2162, and A2366.\nWe plot the positions of cluster galaxies represented by open circles of which radii are\nproportional to e\u03b4 in the second and the fourth columns of Figure 5. A large circle denotes\na galaxy which is deviant in either velocity or dispersion compared with nearby galaxies,\ntherefore groups of large circles indicate the presence of substructure. No substructures of\nS1171, A2162, and A2366 were found in f (\u2206sim > \u2206obs ) test, as confirmed in Figure 5.\n\n5.\n\nDetailed analysis of individual clusters\n\nA single cluster in rotation is expected to show a spatial segregation of high and low\nvelocity galaxies, and to have a single number density peak unlike the case two clusters are\nstill in the middle of merging. Therefore, in the sample of tentative rotating clusters, we\nselect as probable rotating clusters the galaxy clusters that show a spatial segregation of\nhigh and low velocity galaxies in the spatial-density map of Figure 3, and show a single peak\nin the number density map of Figure 5. We describe the selection procedure of the probable\nrotating cluster for an individual cluster in this section.\n\n5.1.\n\nAbell S1171\n\nAbell S1177 is the nearest (z \u223c 0.028) cluster in the sample of tentative rotating clusters.\nIn the plot of velocity versus clustercentric distance of member galaxies (Figure 2), it is seen\nthat some galaxies have large velocity deviations (cz \u2212 cz \u223c1400 km s\u22121 ) from the cluster\nmain body (cz \u223c8400 km s\u22121 ). If we consider only the galaxies in the cluster main body\nrejecting these galaxies (cz >9500 km s\u22121 ) as interlopers (in order to test the effect of this\nsub-component), we obtain |vrot |/\u03c3p =0.33 and dv/dR=299 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 . Then this cluster\nis not included in the the sample of tentative rotating clusters.\n\n\f\u2013 11 \u2013\n5.2.\n\nAbell S0001\n\nAbell S0001 shows a low velocity tail (cz \u223c7800 km s\u22121 ) in the velocity histogram of\nFigure 2. These galaxies in the low velocity tail are spatially concentrated, appear as a\nsubstructure (to the North-East) in Figure 5. The number density map shows two local\ndensity maxima which coinside with the positions of substructures. Therefore, the large\namplitudes of rotation and velocity gradient are considered to be caused by two separated\nsubclusterings. This cluster shows a large ellipticity, and that the position angle of rotation\naxis (Y1) shown in Figure 3 is similar to that of cluster minor axis (\u0393B ). However, the\ndetermination of cluster morphology is uncertain, since no data are available for \u223c 30\u2032 away\nto the North from the cluster center (see Figure 3).\n\n5.3.\n\nAbell 0954\n\nAbell 0954 is surveyed in both SDSS and 2dFGRS, and is one of the most X-ray luminous\nclusters in the sample of tentative rotating clusters. In Figure 3, the position angles of\nrotation axes determined by the rotation fit (Y1) and the global velocity gradient fit (Y2)\ncoincide well, but those position angles appear not to be correlated with the position angle\nof major or minor axis of the dispersion ellipse. The results of 1D substructure tests in\nTable 4 show that the velocity distribution does not deviate from Gaussian significantly.\nThe number density map and Dressler-Shectman (DS) plot in Figure 5 show a weak sign of\nsubclustering \u223c 14\u2032 away to the South-East, and it is suspected that this subclustering might\ncause the large amplitude of rotation. In order to test the effect of the SE subclustering, we\nfit the velocities of member galaxies that are located within 10\u2032 from the cluster center using\nequation (1) and (2). The fitting results in |vrot |/\u03c3p =0.54 and dv/dR=948 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121\nwith the same position angles of rotation axes as the results based on all member galaxies.\nThis implies that the rotation and the velocity gradient are generated in the core region with\na single density peak. Therefore we select this cluster as a probable rotating cluster.\n\n5.4.\n\nAbell 1035\n\nAbell 1035 has the largest X-ray luminosity and the velocity dispersion in the sample\nof tentative rotating clusters. While Flin & Krywult (2006) found no substructure using\nonly positional information of galaxies by applying wavelet analysis, Maurogordato et al.\n(1997) found a bimodal velocity distribution for this cluster using the velocity data of 19\nmember galaxies, as confirmed in Figure 2 based on 97 member galaxies in this study. Our\n\n\f\u2013 12 \u2013\nresult in Figure 2 implies that substructures may exist. In Figure 3, the galaxies of which\nvelocities are greater than the systemic velocity of the cluster (open circles) and the galaxies\nof which velocities are less than the systemic velocity of the cluster (filled circles) are spatially\nseparated clearly by the rotation axis (Y1 and Y2). In addition, the DS plot in Figure 5\nshows two subclusterings (North and South) that coinside with high density regions in the\ngalaxy number density map. Therefore, the large amplitudes of the rotation and the velocity\ngradient including the large velocity dispersion (listed in Table 1), can be explained by two\nsuperimposed or interacting clusters with slightly different systemic velocities.\nAryal & Saurer (2006) found that the spin-vector orientations of the galaxies in this\ncluster tend to lie parallel to the Local Supercluster (LSC) plane, and the spin-vector projections of the galaxies tend to be oriented perpendicular with respect to the direction of\nthe LSC center. In this study, we found that the angle between the rotation axis (Y1) of\nthis cluster and the LSC plane is 56+11\n\u22129 deg. Since the angle between the spin-vector orientations of the galaxies in this cluster and the LSC plane was found to be < 45 deg in\nAryal & Saurer (2006), it appears that the spin-vector orientations of the galaxies determined in Aryal & Saurer (2006) is not related to the rotation axis of this cluster determined\nin this study.\n\n5.5.\n\nAbell 1139\n\nAbell 1139 is surveyed in both SDSS and 2dFGRS, and has the largest number of\nmember galaxies in our sample. A global velocity gradient for this cluster is identified by\nBurgett et al. (2004) using 2dFGRS data with 106 member galaxies. We confirm the global\nvelocity gradient or the rotation using 122 member galaxies with an aid of SDSS data (see\nFigrue 4). The DS plot in Figure 5 shows a presence of strong substructures to the NorthWest and to the South-East, while the velocity histogram shows a unimodal distribution.\nIt is known that positional information of galaxies only shows no clear substructure for this\ncluster (e.g. Krywult et al. 1999; Flin & Krywult 2006), but a distinguishable substructure\nis found based on both positional information and velocity data (e.g. Burgett et al. 2004).\nAs seen in the spatial-velocity plot in Figure 3, the substructures are due to the galaxies with\ndifferent radial velocities. Interestingly, unlike Abell 1035, the galaxy number density map\nshows a single density peak near the cluster center rather than strong concentrations around\ntwo substructures. This may indicate a single cluster in rotation or two overlapping clusters\nthat either merge or depart from each other as pointed in Burgett et al. (2004). Therefore,\nwe select this cluster as a probable rotating cluster.\n\n\f\u2013 13 \u2013\n5.6.\n\nAbell 1373\n\nAbell 1373 is the most distant cluster (z \u223c 0.125) in our sample of tentative rotating\nclusters, and is surveyed in both SDSS and 2dFGRS. The velocity distribution is bimodal,\nand the galaxies with high velocities (cz \u223c39000 km s\u22121 ) and the galaxies with low velocities\n(cz \u223c36000 km s\u22121 ) are spatially separated by the rotation axis (see Figure 3). Similar to the\ncase of Abell 1035, the substructures introduced by the clustering of galaxies with different\nvelocities coincide with the galaxy number density peaks, implying that the large amplitudes\nof rotation and velocity gradient are introduced by two disparate groups (see Figure 5).\n\n5.7.\n\nAbell 1399\n\nAbell 1399 is one of the member clusters in the Leo A Supercluster (Einasto et al. 2001).\nThis cluster has the smallest velocity dispersion in our sample of tentative rotating clusters,\nand is surveyed in both SDSS and 2dFGRS. The velocity distribution is unimodal, but\nthe spatial-velocity plot of Figure 3 shows a segregation of galaxies with different velocities.\nIntriguingly, the dispersion ellipse is significantly flatted with the ellipticity of 0.57. Since the\nposition angles (138 deg for the major axis and 48 deg for the minor axis) of the dispersion\nellipse deviate from those (207 deg for Y1 and 186 deg for Y2) of the rotation axes, it appears\nthat the high ellipticity is not related to the global rotation of this cluster. Figure 5 shows\nthat there is no strong sign of the correlation between the number density peaks and the\nsubstructures. Therefore, we select this cluster as a probable rotating cluster.\n\n5.8.\n\nAbell 1474\n\nAbell 1474 is one of the member clusters in the Virgo-Coma Supercluster (Einasto et al.\n2001). Flin & Krywult (2006) found no substructure using only positional information of\ngalaxies, but the 1D substructure tests indicate that the velocity distribution deviates from\nthe Gaussian significantly. In Figure 5, the DS plot shows that there are three substructures\n(to the North-East, to the South-West, and to the South-East) that coincide with three\nnumber density peaks in the left panel. It indicates that the large amplitudes of rotation\nand velocity gradient are due to the different velocities of sub-groups.\n\n\f\u2013 14 \u2013\n5.9.\n\nAbell 2162\n\nAbell 2162 is one of the nearest clusters in our sample, and is a member cluster in the\nHercules Supercluster (Einasto et al. 2001). Neither a distinct substructure nor a significant\nlocal density peak is found except for the cluster center in Figure 5. Interestingly, it appears\nthat the radial distribution of the member galaxies in Figure 2 is discontinuous at \u223c 18\u2032 .\nTherefore, if we compute the rotation amplitude and the global velocity gradient using only\nthe galaxies at the inner region (< 18\u2032 ), we obtain |vrot |/\u03c3p =0.64 and dv/dR=635 km s\u22121\nMpc\u22121 , still satisfying the criteria for the rotating clusters. Therefore, we select this cluster\nas a probable rotating cluster.\n\n5.10.\n\nAbell 2169\n\nIn Figure 3, the galaxies of which velocities are greater than the systemic velocity of\nAbell 2169 (open circles) and the galaxies of which velocities are less than the systemic\nvelocity (filled circles), are separated well by the rotation axis (Y1). The position angle (342\ndeg) of rotation axis (Y1) is similar to that (328 deg) of the minor axis of the dispersion\nellipse, implying that the flatness may be caused by the cluster rotation. The substructures\n(North-East and South-West) seen in the DS plot, are separated by the cluster centroid\nthat coincides with the single number density peak. Therefore, this cluster is selected as a\nprobable rotating cluster.\n\n5.11.\n\nAbell 2366\n\nJones & Forman (1999) classified the morphology of Abell 2366 using Einstein X-ray\nimages as a \"single\", means a cluster in which no substructures or no departures from\nsymmetry are found. Flin & Krywult (2006) also found no substructure using only positional\ninformation of galaxies by applying wavelet analysis. Similarly, the galaxy number density\nmap and the DS plot in Figure 5 indicate no strong evidence of substructures. Therefore,\nwe select this cluster as a probable rotating cluster.\n\n5.12.\n\nAbell 4053\n\nAbell 4053 is one of the member clusters in the Pisces-Cetus Supercluster (Porter & Raychaudhury\n2005), and is known to be contaminated by a foreground group at z = 0.0501 (Mazure et al.\n\n\f\u2013 15 \u2013\n1996). The galaxies in the foreground group (cz \u223c15000 km s\u22121 ) are seen in Figure 2, and\nare rejected from determining the membership of Abell 4053. However, the galaxies at the\nlow velocity tail (cz \u223c17500 km s\u22121 ) are selected as members of Abell 4053. These galaxies\nare found in the South-West region from the cluster centroid (see Figure 3), and are detected\nas a subcluster in the DS plot. In order to estimate the effect of these galaxies in the low\nvelocity tail, we determine the amplitudes of the rotation and the velocity gradient using\nonly the galaxies in the main body (cz >18000 km s\u22121 ). The fitting results in |vrot |/\u03c3p =0.47\nand dv/dR=716 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 , which does not satisfy the criteria for the tentative rotating\ncluster. Therefore, this cluster is not selected as a probable rotating cluster.\nWe summarize the global kinematic properties for 12 tentative rotating clusters in Table\n5. The column (1) gives the Abell identification. The column (2), (3) and (4) represent the\nexistence of substructure resulted from 1D, 2D and 3D tests, respectively. The cluster\nmorphology determined in Section 4.1 is given in the column (5): 'Spherical' for ellipticity\n< 0.2 and 'Elongated' for ellipticity \u2265 0.2. The dynamical status determined in Section 6 is\ngiven in the column (6) and the selection of probable rotating clusters is in the final column\n(7).\n\n6.\n6.1.\n\nDiscussion\n\nDynamical status of probable rotating clusters\n\nThe study of dynamical state of the propable rotating clusters is useful for understanding the origin of the global rotation across the cluster. It is expected from self-similar\nmodels that a relationship between the X-ray luminosity and the velocity dispersion of the\nclusters exists as Lx \u221d \u03c3p4 (e.g. Quintana & Melnick 1982). For galaxy clusters in SDSS,\nPopesso et al. (2005) found the relation of Lx \u221d \u03c3p3.68\u00b10.25 . For galaxy clusters in 2dFGRS,\nHilton et al. (2005) found the relation of Lx \u221d \u03c3p4.8\u00b10.7 , and suggested that high-Lx clusters\nare more dynamically evolved systems than the low-Lx clusters. In Figure 6, we plot the\nX-ray luminosity as a function of the velocity dispersion and the virial mass for the probable\nrotating clusters (filled circles) of which X-ray luminosities are available in the literature in\ncomparison with the non-rotating galaxy clusters (open circles) of which X-ray luminosities\nare available in the literature among the selected 56 galaxy clusters. We plot the X-ray luminosities from the several literature separately. It appears that most galaxy clusters shown\nin Figure 6 follow Lx \u2212 \u03c3p and Lx \u2212 Mvir relations (solid lines) determined in this study.\nMoreover, several interesting features are seen in the probable rotating clusters. First, the\nprobable rotating clusters do not deviate from the best-fit line, implying that those clusters\nare in dynamical equilibrium. Secondly, the velocity dispersions and the virial masses for the\n\n\f\u2013 16 \u2013\nprobable rotating clusters appear to be smaller than those for the non-rotating clusters. In\naddition, the X-ray luminosities for the probable rotating clusters also appear to be smaller\nthan those for the non-rotating clusters. If we adopt the result of Hilton et al. (2005), the\nprobable rotating clusters that have low X-ray luminosities might have a lower fraction of\nearly-type, passively evolving galaxies than the galaxy clusters with high X-ray luminosities.\nIf galaxy clusters rotate, the velocity dispersions and the corresponding virial masses\nshould be corrected for the cluster rotation (e.g. Kalinkov et al. 2005). We derived the\nvelocity dispersions about the best fit rotation curve of equation (1) and the corresponding\ncorrected virial masses for the probable rotating clusters. The results are summarized in Table 6. The first and the second columns represent, respectively, the velocity dispersion about\nthe mean velocity of the cluster and that about the best fit rotation curve of equation (1).\nThe third and the fourth columns represent, respectively, the virial mass using the rotation\nuncorrected (the first column) velocity dispersion and that using the rotation corrected (the\nsecond column) velocity dispersion. The velocity dispersions are reduced by 6\u221214%, and\non the average are reduced by 11%. The corresponding virial masses are also reduced by\n11\u221227%, and on the average are reduced by 21%.\nThe dynamics of the brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) or cD galaxies in galaxy clusters\nare also useful for understanding the formation history of galaxy clusters (e.g. Oegerle & Hill\n2001). In particular, a peculiar velocity of BCGs, which is defined by vp = vBCG \u2212 vcl , where\nvBCG is a radial velocity of BCGs and vcl is a mean velocity of the cluster, is a useful\nindicator of the dynamical state for the cluster (Oegerle & Hill 2001). To estimate the\npeculiar velocities of BCGs in clusters, we first identified the BCGs that have the smallest bJ\nmagnitudes in the catalog of member galaxies for the selected 56 galaxy clusters. Then we\nconducted a visual inspection of cluster images whether there are any brighter galaxies than\nthe selected BCGs using the catalog of member galaxies. Since some brightest galaxies in\ngalaxy clusters were not covered due to the observational difficulties such as a fiber collision\nand a saturation, we finally selected 20 galaxy clusters of which BCGs in the catalog agree\nwith those in the images. Using the sample of selected 20 galaxy clusters, we plot the absolute\nvalue of the peculiar velocity of BCGs as a function of the clustercentric distance, the redshift\nof clusters as a function of the absolute magnitude of BCGs in bJ band, and the velocity\ndispersion of clusters as a function of the absolute value of the peculiar velocity of BCGs. It\nis seen that the absolute values of peculiar velocities of the BCGs are in the range of 10\u2212780\nkm s\u22121 , and the median value of peculiar velocities is 257 km s\u22121 . The mean uncertainty\nfor the values of peculiar velocities is 168 km s\u22121 . In addition, the clustercentric distances\nof BCGs are in the rage of 0\u2212300 kpc, and the median value of clustercentric distances is\n82 kpc. Interestingly, the peculiar velocities and the clustercentric distances of BCGs for\ntwo (A0954 and A1399) probable rotating clusters are smaller than the median value of each\n\n\f\u2013 17 \u2013\nparameter. The small peculiar velocity and the small spatial deviation of BCGs from the\ncluster center indicate that the clusters are in the dynamical equilibrium. It may imply that\nthe clusters do not undergo a recent merging if the clusters are formed through a repeated\nmerging. In addition, the absolute magnitudes of BCGs for two probable rotating clusters do\nnot show any significant deviation from the distribution of the non-rotating galaxy clusters.\n\n6.2.\n\nProbable rotating clusters and spatial orientations of cluster galaxies\n\nAn interesting connection between the global rotation of clusters and the anisotropy in\ngalaxy alignments for clusters is expected in the context of angular momentum in galaxy\nclusters:\n1. Aryal & Saurer (2004, 2005, 2006) found that the anisotropy in galaxy alignments increases systematically from early-type (BM type I) to late-type (BM type II-III and III)\nclusters. Interestingly, four of six probable rotating clusters in this study are late-type\nclusters. Therefore, there may exist a connection between the rotation axes of the probable rotating clusters in this study and the spin-vector orientations of cluster galaxies.\nIn order to examine this connection, we present in Figure 8 the spatial distribution\nand the histogram for the projected spin-vector orientations of galaxies in six probable rotating clusters. We used an orientation parameter (ORIENT) in 2dFGRS and\nan isophotal position angle parameter in g band (isoPhi g) in SDSS as the projected\nspin-vector orientations for cluster galaxies (Colless et al. 2001; Stoughton et al. 2002).\nThe position angles of the projected orientations for the cluster galaxies are measured\nin the range of 0 \u2212 180 deg, but are plotted twice in the range of 0 \u2212 360 deg. Figure 8\nshows that there is no strong anisotropy in spin-vector orientations of cluster galaxies\n(i.e. no strong peak in histogram). Therefore, it is difficult to compare the position\nangle of the rotation axes and that of the spin-vector orientations of cluster galaxies.\n2. It was found that spin-vector orientations of galaxies in clusters tend to lie parallel to\nthe Local Supercluster (LSC) plane (Aryal & Saurer 2006; Hu et al. 2006). In order to\ninvestigate the connection between the rotation axes of rotating clusters and the LSC\nplane, we plot in Figure 9 all-sky distribution of six probable rotating clusters with\ntheir rotation axes (Y1) in the supergalactic coordinate. It appears that there are no\npreferred directions of rotation axes for six probable rotating clusters, while spin-vector\norientations of cluster galaxies in Aryal & Saurer (2006) and Hu et al. (2006) tend to\nlie parallel to the Local Supercluster (LSC) plane (the results does not change if we\nuse Y2 instead of Y1).\n\n\f\u2013 18 \u2013\nSince we do not know the three-dimensional information about the rotation axis for\nrotating clusters and the three-dimensional spin-vector orientations of cluster galaxies in\nthis study, it is difficult to conclude the connection between the global rotation of clusters\nand the anisotropy in galaxy alignments for clusters at this moment. Therefore, it is needed\nto study the three-dimensional spatial orientations of galaxies for these rotating clusters to\ninvestigate this connection.\n\n6.3.\n\nCosmological implication of probable rotating clusters\n\nBased on the model proposed by Li (1998) that the global rotation of the universe may\nprovide angular momentum to celestial bodies on their formation, Godlowski et al. (2005)\nfound the vanishing angular momenta for the masses corresponding to the galaxy groups\nusing Tully's galaxy groups. They suggested the non-vanshing angular momenta for smaller\nand larger structures (compact galaxy groups and rich galaxy clusters). However, the nonvanishing angular momenta for galaxy clusters were found indirectly based on the study\nof the galaxy orientation. In this study, we found the non-vanishing angular momenta for\ngalaxy clusters directly based on the dynamical analysis. This result is consistent with\nthat of Godlowski et al. (2005). However, we found that the estimated masses for rotating\nclusters are in the range of 1014 \u2212 1015 M\u2299 (see Table 6). In addition, we could not identify\nrotating clusters in massive clusters with > 2 \u00d7 1015 M\u2299 . Intriguingly, the mass range of\nrotating clusters in this study is corresponding to the mass scale (1014 \u2212 1015 M\u2299 ) with\nvanishing angular momentum predicted by Godlowski et al. (2003). Since the masses of\nTully's galaxy groups used in Godlowski et al. (2005) are expected to be smaller than those\nof Abell clusters used in this study, this contradiction of the mass scale between the theory\nand the observation should be investigated further.\n\n7.\n\nSummary\n\nWe present a result of searching for galaxy clusters that show an indication of global\nrotation using a spectroscopic sample of galaxies in SDSS and 2dFGRS. Our results are\nsummarized as follows:\n1. We have determined the member galaxies of 899 Abell clusters covered in SDSS and\n2dFGRS. We have estimated the ratio of rotation amplitude to velocity dispersion,\nand the velocity gradient for 56 clusters in which the number of member galaxies are\ngreater than or equal to 40.\n\n\f\u2013 19 \u2013\n2. Among 56 clusters, we have selected 12 tentative rotating clusters which have large\nvalues of the ratio (>0.53) of rotation amplitude to velocity dispersion, and of the\nvelocity gradient (>380 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 ).\n3. We have determined the cluster morphology for 12 tentative rotating clustersmight\nusing the dispersion ellipse method. The ellipticity of the dispersion ellipse is in the\nrange of 0.08\u22120.57, and the position angle of major or minor axis appears not to be\nrelated to the position angles of rotation axes (Y1 and Y2).\n4. We have investigated the substructures (1D, 2D, and 3D) for the sample of tentative\nrotating clusters. DS plots show that the majority (9 out of 12) of clusters show an\nevidence of substructure due to the spatially correlated velocities of galaxies.\n5. We have selected six probable rotating clusters (Abell 0954, Abell 1139, Abell 1399,\nAbell 2162, Abell 2169, and Abell 2366) that show a single number density peak around\nthe cluster center with a spatial segregation of the high and low velocity galaxies in\nclusters.\n6. The probable rotating clusters do not deviate significantly from the relation of the\nX-ray luminosity and the velocity dispersion or the virial mass of the clusters. The\npeculiar velocities and the clustercentric distances of BCGs for two (A0954 and A1399)\nprobable rotating clusters indicate that they may be in a dynamical equilibrium and\nundergo no recent merging.\nIt will be interesting to investigate the dynamical state of probable rotating clusters\nusing X-ray data in order to compare the properties of the intracluster medium and those\nof galaxies.\nWe would like to thank the referee, B.
