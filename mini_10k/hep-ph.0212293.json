Kerbikov\nState Research Center\nInstitute of Theoretical and Experimental Physics,\nMoscow, Russia\nAbstract\nWe have reexamined the problem of n \u2212 n\u0304 oscillations for ultracold neutrons (UCN) confined within a trap. We have shown that the\ngrowth of the n\u0304 component with time is to a decent accuracy given\nby P (n\u0304) = \u03b52nn\u0304 tL t, where \u03b5nn\u0304 is the mixing parameter, tL \u223c 1 sec in\nthe neutron propagation time between subsequent collisions with the\ntrap walls. Possible corrections to this law and open questions are\ndiscussed.\n\n1\n\nIntroduction\n\nDuring several decades the problem of nucleon instability is a subject of\nintense and diversified theoretical and experimental studies. An interesting facet of this fundamental problem is a hypothetical process of neutronantineutron oscillations [1]. Such oscillations have been thoroughly discussed\nin free-space regime and inside nuclei -see e.g. [1]-[5] and references therein.\nThe third and very interesting possibility to search for n \u2212 n\u0304 oscillations is\nto use ultra-cold neutrons (UCN) confined in a trap. This subject was discussed by several authors [2, 3, 6] but in contrast to the first two regimes the\npicture of n \u2212 n\u0304 oscillations of UCN remains rather obscure. On the other\nhand several experiments of this kind are in preparation now. Therefore it\nis appropriate to address this subject again. We shall follow two complementary lines of arguments. The first one is based on simple qualitative\n1\n\n\festimates while the second makes use of the time evolution equation focusing on the interaction of the two-component n \u2212 n\u0304 system with the walls of\nthe trap. Both approaches lead to a conclusion that the n\u0304 component grows\n(approximately) linearly with observation time contrary to quadratic time\ndependence in the free-space regime.\n\n2\n\nRelevant Parameters\n\nWe start by introducing a set of definitions and parameters. Our treatment\nwill be somewhat schematic in the sense that we do not consider any specific\ngeometry of the trap, concrete UCN spectrum, and a variety of the trap\nmaterials. All these points can be easily accounted for as soon as one sticks\nto a given experimental setup.\nFirst we remind that neutrons with energy E < 10\u22127 eV= 100neV are\ncalled ultra-cold. A useful relation connecting the neutron velocity v in\ncm/sec and E in neV reads\nv(cm/sec) \u2243 102 {E(neV)/5.22}1/2 .\n\n(1)\n\nIn particular the velocity corresponding to E = 100 neV is v \u2243 4.4*102 cm/sec.\nA less formal definition of UCN involves a notion of the real part of the\noptical potential corresponding to the trap material. Namely, neutrons with\nenergies less than the height of this potential are called ultra-cold. The\ntwo definitions are essentially equivalent since for most materials the optical\npotential is of the order of 100 neV (see below).\nOur main interest concerns strongly absorptive interaction of antineutron\ncomponent with the trap wall. Therefore very weak absorption of neutrons\non the wall will be neglected. Interesting by itself this problem is out of\nthe scope of the present work. According to the second definition of UCN\n(i.e. E < UnA ) they undergo complete reflection from the trap walls and\nmay be stored for about 103 sec (\u03b2 - decay time) as was first point out by\nYa.B.Zeldovich [7]. For each material the limiting neutron velocity is given\nby (1) with E substituted by UnA .\nTo be concrete we consider neutrons with energy E = 80 neV which\naccording to (1) corresponds to v = 3.9 * 102 cm/sec. Such neutrons have\nmomenta k \u2243 12.3 eV, de Broglie wave lengths \u03bb \u2243 10\u22125 cm. As for the\nwall material we take C 12 with the density \u03c1 = 2.25g/cm3, or N \u2243 1.13 *\n10\u221216 f m\u22123 . The coherent nC 12 scattering length is an = 6.65f m [8] (the\n2\n\n\fimaginary part of the scattering length is at least 3 orders of magnitude\nsmaller and is ignored as was already stated). The corresponding nC 12 optical\npotential reads\n2\u03c0\nUn =\nNan \u2243 195neV,\n(2)\nm\nwith m being the neutron mass. Limiting velocity corresponding to E = Un is\nvn(0) \u2243 6.1 * 102 cm/sec. Thus neutrons under consideration with vn = 3.9 * 102\ncm/sec are certainly ultra-cold with respect to C 12 trap walls.\nThe experimental data on antineutron-nuclei scattering lengths at ultralow energies are absent. Only some indirect information may be gained\nfrom the level shifts of antiprotonic atoms. The energy behavior of the n\u0304A\nannihilation cross-section is governed by the well-known \" 1/v\" law\n\u03c3a = \u22124\u03c0\n\nIman\u0304A\n.\nk\n\n(3)\n\nSeveral fits to the n\u0304A scattering lengths have been proposed in the literature. We consider as most reliable that of Ref. [9] based on internuclear\ncascade model. Even within this particular model one finds several solutions\nfor n\u0304C 12 scattering length. Therefore the one we have chosen for our analysis\nmay be called \"motivated\" by Ref. [9] and reads\nan\u0304 = (3 \u2212 i1)f m.\n\n(4)\n\nThen according to (2) the n\u0304C 12 optical potential is equal to\nVn\u0304 = Un\u0304 \u2212 iWn\u0304 \u2243 (90 \u2212 i30)neV.\n\n(5)\n\nThe limiting n\u0304 velocity corresponding to Un\u0304 from (5) is according to (1)\n\u2243 4.15 * 102 cm/sec. Now our choice E = 80neV < Un\u0304 < Un is clear since\nwe want to deal with \"ultra-cold\" n\u0304 as well. The case Un\u0304 < E < Un will\nbe considered in the next publication. Needless to say that due to strong n\u0304\nabsorption the condition En\u0304 < Un\u0304 in no way provides complete reflection of\nn\u0304 from the wall \u2013 see below.\nNext we remind that the lower limit on n \u2212 n\u0304 oscillation time \u03c4nn\u0304 has\nbeen obtained from experimental study of n \u2212 n\u0304 transitions in free space and\ninside nuclei \u2013 see [10, 4, 11, 9] and references therein. For our purposes it is\nenough to keep in mind a crude value\n(0)\nvn\u0304\n\n\u03c4nn\u0304 > 108 sec.\n3\n\n(6)\n\n\fCorrespondingly the value of the mixing parameter is\n\u03b5nn\u0304 =\n\n1\n< 10\u221223 eV.\n\u03c4nn\u0304\n\n(7)\n\nThe dynamical meaning of \u03b5nn\u0304 will be clear from the evolution equation which\nwill be presented below. To give some perception of the value of \u03b5nn\u0304 we may\nsay that if one considers neutron confined in a one-dimensional 5 meters long\nbox then the level splitting will be just 10\u221223 eV.\nFinally we introduce the parameter tL \u223c 1sec \u2013 the time which neutrons\nneed to cross the trapping box, or the time between two subsequent collisions\nwith the walls. We also remind that both \u03b2-decay time and the UCN storage\ntime are of the order of 103 sec.\n\n3\n\nHitting the Trap Wall: Simple Estimates\n\nNow with relevant parameters at hands we can analyze what happens with\nneutrons and possible antineutrons admixture when they interacts with the\nwall of the trap. In this section we present simple estimates.\nTreatment based on time evolution equation will be postponed till the\nnext section. A third approach based on the wave packets formulation will\nbe only touched on in present paper and discussed in detail in the next\npublication.\nFirst we consider the collision of neutrons with the wall. As compared to\nantineutrons this problem is much simpler due to the lack of absorption (see\nremarks on the previous pages).\nIn our illustrative example a neutron with v = 3.9 * 102 cm/sec is hitting\nthe C 12 wall of the trap. Such a velocity is well below the limiting C 12 value\nvn(0) \u2243 6.1 * 102 cm/sec and hence neutron undergoes a complete reflection,\nR = 1. Being absolutely correct, the statement that the reflection coefficient\n(0)\nR = 1 does not constitute the whole story. First, even at v < vn\u0304 the tail\nof the neutron wave function penetrates inside the wall. On general grounds\nthe penetration depth is lw (n) \u223c \u03bb \u2243 10\u22125 cm, with \u03bb being de Broglie wave\nlength. Second, collision with the wall is not an instantaneous act but is\ncharacterized by certain collision time. The rigorous derivation of this time\nshould be based on the wave packets formalism [12]-[14]. However simple\nestimates presented below yield the same results.\n\n4\n\n\fInside the wall the neutron wave function has the form\n\u03c8n\u0304 (x) \u221d exp{\u2212\u03ban x}, \u03ban =\n\nq\n\n2m(Un \u2212 E).\n\n(8)\n\nFrom 8) it is natural to identify\nlw (n) \u223c 1/\u03ban \u2243 0.14 * 10\u22125 cm,\n\n(9)\n\nwhich is few times less than the naive expectation lw (n) \u223c \u03bb = 10\u22125 cm.\nCollision time may be estimated as1\n\u03c4coll (n) \u223c\n\n2lw (n)\n\u2243 0.7 * 10\u22128 sec.\nv\n\n(10)\n\nThis result is in perfect agreement with what is predicted from collision\ntheory formulated in terms of the wave packets. Namely, if one describes the\nincident neutron by a wave packet\n\u03c8n (x, t) =\n\nr\n\na\nk 2 t sin[(x \u2212 vt)/a]\nexp(ikx \u2212\n)\n,\n\u03c0\n2m\nx \u2212 vt\n\n(11)\n\nwhere a is its width in x-space, then\n\u03c4coll = [E(U0 \u2212 E)]\u22121/2 \u2243 0.7 * 10\u22128 sec\n\n(12)\n\nfor E =\n80 neV, U0 = 195 neV. At this point we note that \u03c4coll v = 2lw \u226a\n\u0010 \u0011\u22121\n\u03bb \u2206\u03bb\n. We shall return to this remark in connection with possible\na= \u03c0 \u03bb\ndecoherence of n and n\u0304 due to the difference in their collision times.\nNow we turn to n\u0304 with the same velocity v = 3.9 * 102 cm/sec hitting the\nC 12 wall.\nDue to absorption (annihilation) the n\u0304 wave function inside the wall has\nthe form\n\u03c8n\u0304 (x) \u221d eikn\u0304 x\u2212\u03ban\u0304x ,\n(13)\n(ikn\u0304 \u2212 \u03ban\u0304 )2 = 2m(Un\u0304 \u2212 iWn\u0304 \u2212 E),\n\n(14)\n\nwhere E is the energy of the incident n\u0304.

The\nlater quantity is velocity independent by virtue of the \"1/v\" law (3) and is\nexpressed through the n\u0304 mean free path \u039b according to\n\u03c4abs (n\u0304) \u223c\n\n\u039b\nm\n\u2243\n\u2243 1.1 * 10\u22128 sec\nv\n4\u03c0N|Iman\u0304A |\n\n(17)\n\nfor the C 12 trap wall. Thus\n\u03c4coll (n\u0304)/\u03c4abs (n\u0304) > 1,\n\n(18)\n\nwhich implies the collapse of the possible n\u0304 component on the wall.\nAlready at this point it is clear that this in turn leads to the time dependence of the probability to find n\u0304 component announced in the Abstract,\nnamely P (n\u0304) = \u03b52 tL t. A rigorous derivation of this equation is given in the\nnext section.\nStill one may argue that the above estimates should be taken with caution\nand certain fraction of n\u0304 may be still reflected from the wall. Then Eqs.(10)\nand (16) enable to estimate the splitting between the centers of the n and n\u0304\nwave packets (see (11)) after the reflection. One has\n\u03b4x \u2243 v(\u03c4coll (n\u0304) \u2212 \u03c4coll (n)) \u2243 0.35 * 10\u22125cm \u223c \u03bb \u226a a.\n\n(19)\n\nWhether this retardation influences the n \u2212 n\u0304 mixing in free space between\ncollisions with the trap walls will be discussed elsewhere.\nThe main point to be improved on in the above estimates is mentioned\nin the footnote to Eq.(10). Certain guidance in this direction may be found\nin [15].\nFinally we note that the treatment presented above seems physically more\ntransparent than formal calculations of the reflection coefficient from the\ncomplex potential.\n2\n\nWave packets formalism, as was shown by V.A.Lensky, leads to somewhat smaller\nvalue \u2013 see our next publication.\n\n6\n\n\f4\n\nHitting the Trap Wall: Time-Dependent\nApproach\n\nAs a \"warming up\" exercise we consider n\u2212 n\u0304 oscillations in a free space with\n\u03b2- decay neglected. This is a standard two-level problem treated in any serious textbook on Quantum Mechanics. The phenomenological Hamiltonian\nis a 2 \u00d7 2 matrix in the basis of the two-component n \u2212 n\u0304 wave function\nH = Ei \u03b4ij + \u03b5\u03c3x ,\n\n(20)\n\nwith i, j = n, n\u0304. The evolution equation reads\n\u2202\ni\n\u2202t\n\n\u03c8n\n\u03c8n\u0304\n\n!\n\n=\n\nEn \u03b5\n\u03b5\nEn\u0304\n\n!\n\n\u03c8n\n\u03c8n\u0304\n\n!\n\n.\n\n(21)\n\nAssuming that \u03c8n (t = 0) = 1, \u03c8n\u0304 (t = 0) = 0, and diagonalizing the\nHamiltonian (20) one arrives at the following expression for the probability\nof finding n\u0304 at a time t [2]-[6]\n\u03c8n\u0304 (t)|2 =\n\n4\u03b52\n1\u221a 2\nsin2 (\n\u03c9 + 4\u03b52 t),\n2\n2\n\u03c9 + 4\u03b5\n2\n\n(22)\n\nwhere \u03c9 = (En\u0304 \u2212 En ). In free space the difference between En\u0304 and En may\nbe due to the Earth magnetic field. In this case\n\u03c9 = 2\u03bcn B \u2243 6 * 10\u221212 eV.\n\n(23)\n\nWithout magnetic field, i.e. at \u03c9 = 0, and at t \u226a \u03c4nn\u0304 \u2243 108 sec one has\n|\u03c8n\u0304 (t)|2 \u2243 \u03b52nn\u0304 t2 ,\n\n(24)\n\nwhile with the Earth magnetic field Eq.(24) is valid only at extremely short\ntimes, t \u226a (\u03bcB)\u22121 \u2243 2 * 10\u22124 sec, while at large times\n|\u03c8n\u0304 (t)|2 \u2243\n\n4\u03b52\nsin2 t/\u03c4B \u2243 10\u221223 sin2 t/\u03c4B ,\n\u03c92\n\n(25)\n\nwhere \u03c4B = (\u03bcB)\u22121 \u2243 2 * 10\u22124 sec.\nThe use of (22) to test fundamental symmetries is discussed in [5].\nNext we consider the general Hamiltonian of the n \u2212 n\u0304 system inside the\nwall with annihilation and \u03b2-decay included. The problem is reminiscent\n7\n\n\fof strangeness oscillations in K K\u0304 system. With annihilation and \u03b2-decay\nincluded the Hamiltonian (20) is substituted by\nEn \u2212 i\n\u03b5\n\nH=\n\n\u0393\u03b2\n2\n\n\u03b5\n\u0393\nEn\u0304 \u2212 i \u03932a \u2212 i 2\u03b2\n\n!\n\n,\n\n(26)\n\n3\n12\nwhere \u0393\u22121\n\u03b2 \u223c 10 sec, \u0393a \u2243 2Wn \u2243 60 neV for C .\nIn arriving to (22) diagonalization of the Hamiltonian (20) has been done\nexactly. Performing similar procedure with (26) use can be made of a small\nparameter 4\u03b52 \u226a |H11 \u2212 H22 |2 . Indeed, inside the wall effective fields acting\non n and n\u0304 differ by tens of neV (see (2) and (5)) while \u03b5 \u223c 10\u221214 neV.\nExpanding {(H11 \u2212 H22 )2 + 4\u03b52 }1/2 with respect to this small parameter one\nfinds the two eigenvalues of the Hamiltonian (26)\n\n\u03bc1 \u2243 En\u2032 \u2212 i\n\n\u0393\u03b2\n\u0393\u03b5\n\u2212i ,\n2\n2\n\n(27)\n\n\u0393\u03b2\n\u0393\u03b5\n\u0393a\n\u2212i\n+i .\n2\n2\n2\n\u2032\n\u2032\nHere En = En \u2212 E\u03b5 , En\u0304 = En\u0304 + E\u03b5 , and\n\u03bc2 \u2243 En\u0304\u2032 \u2212 i\n\nE\u03b5 + i\n\n(28)\n\n\u03b52\n\u0393\u03b5\n=\n.\n2\nEn\u0304 \u2212 En \u2212 i \u03932a\n\n(29)\n\nThe \"wrong\" sign of the last term in (28) is an artifact of the square root\nexpansion, but this is physically irrelevant since \u0393\u03b5 \u226a \u0393\u03b2 \u226a \u0393a (\u0393\u03b5 \u223c\n10\u221239 eV, \u0393\u03b2 \u223c 10\u221218 eV, \u0393a \u223c 10\u22127eV).\nIn terms of eigenvalues \u03bc1 and \u03bc2 the general solution of the two-component\nevolution equation has the form [16]\n\u03c8(t) =\n\n\u03c8n (t)\n\u03c8n\u0304 (t)\n\n!\n\n=\n\n!\n\nH \u2212 \u03bc2 \u2212i\u03bc1 t H \u2212 \u03bc1 \u2212i\u03bc2 t\n\u03c8(0).\ne\n+\ne\n\u03bc1 \u2212 \u03bc2\n\u03bc2 \u2212 \u03bc1\n\n(30)\n\nAgain we start with a solution corresponding to initial conditions \u03c8n (t =\n0) = 1, \u03c8n\u0304 (t = 0) = 0. Then from (26)-(30) one gets\n|\u03c8n\u0304 (t)|2 =\n\n\u03b52\n\u03c92 +\n\n\u001a\n\n\u2032\n\ne\u2212(\u0393\u03b2 +\u0393\u03b5 )t 1 + e\u2212\u0393a t \u2212 2e\u2212\n\u03932\na\n\n4\n\n8\n\n\u0393\u2032a\nt\n2\n\n\u001b\n\ncos \u03c9t ,\n\n(31)\n\n\fwhere \u03c9 = (En\u0304 \u2212 En ), \u0393\u2032a = \u0393a \u2212 2\u0393\u03b5 , and \u0393\u03b5 is defined by (29). Since\n\u0393\u03b5 \u226a \u0393\u03b2 and \u0393\u03b5 \u226a \u0393a , one can rewrite (31) in a simpler form without\nnoticeable lost of accuracy, namely\n|\u03c8n\u0304 (t)|2 =\n\n\u03b52\n\u03c92 +\n\nn\n\ne\u2212\u0393\u03b2 t 1 + e\u2212\u0393a t \u2212 2e\u2212\n\u03932\na\n\n4\n\n\u0393a\nt\n2\n\no\n\ncos \u03c9t\n\n(32)\n\nThis equation resembles that giving the probability to find K\u0304 0 in initially\npure K 0 beam. Notice that instead of the overall factor 1/4 for K 0 \u2212 K\u0304 0\nsystem we find in (32) an extremely small factor \u03b52 (\u03c9 2 + \u03932a /4)\u22121 \u223c 10\u221232 (!)\nreflecting the fact that mixing is very small as compared to the complex\nsplitting of n and n\u0304 eigenvalues in the medium.\nConsider (32) at t = \u03c4coll (n\u0304) \u2243 1.6 * 10\u22128 sec (see (16)). Then \u0393\u03b2 \u03c4coll (n\u0304) \u223c\n\u221211\n10 , \u0393a \u03c4coll (n\u0304) \u2243 1.5, cos \u03c9\u03c4coll (n\u0304) \u2243 0.7, and (32) yields\n< 10\u221232 .\n|\u03c8n\u0304 (\u03c4coll (n\u0304))|2 \u223c\n\n(33)\n\nPhysically this means that if a pure n beam collides with a wall made of\nC the tiny admixture of n\u0304 which would have emerged during the collision\ntime is completely damped by annihilation and n \u2212 n\u0304 energy splitting.\nThe free-space regime (24) is \"hidden\" in (32) at the limit of very short\ntimes, t \u226a 1/\u0393a \u223c 10\u22128 sec. Then\n12\n\n|\u03c8n\u0304 (t)|2 \u2243\n\n\u03b52\n\u03c92 +\n\n\u03932a\n4\n\nsin2\n\n\u03c9t\n\u03b52 t2\n\u2243\n\u2243 0.9\u03b52 t2 ,\n2\n1 + \u03932a /4\u03c9 2\n\n(34)\n\nwhere at the last step use has been made of the values of \u0393a and \u03c9 for C 12 .\nNext consider (30) at initial conditions which are closer to real experimental situation. Namely, suppose that UCN beam collides with the wall\nafter crossing the trap. The Earth magnetic field is assumed to be shielded,\nso that the free-space equation (24) is valid inside the trap. Then initial\nconditions in (30) read\n\u03c8n\u0304 (t = 0) = \u03b5tL , \u03c8n (t = 0) =\n\nq\n\n1 \u2212 \u03b52 t2L ,\n\n(35)\n\nwhere tL \u2243 1 sec. Then at t = \u03c4coll (n\u0304) \u2243 1.6 * 10\u22128 sec, i.e. just after the\ncollision with the wall, one gets\n|\u03c8n\u0304 (\u03c4coll )|2 \u2243 \u03b52 t2L e\u2212(\u0393a +\u0393\u03b2 )\u03c4coll [1 + 0 (1/tL \u0393a )] .\n9\n\n(36)\n\n\fThis result is again physically transparent. During the collision the n\u0304 component is depleted by annihilation, while antineutrons \"newly born\" inside\nthe wall are damped according to our previous result (32).\nNow \u03c4coll (n\u0304) \u2243 1.6 * 10\u22128 sec, \u0393a \u2243 60 NeV, so that exp(\u2212\u0393a \u03c4coll ) \u2243 0.2.\nThis means that only 1 per \u2243 5n\u0304 survives after the collision.\nThis result is in line with estimates presented in Section 3 but here we\nare on somewhat more qualitative footing.\nIf one considers the fraction 1/5 as a small parameter, then the probability\nof antineutron detection at time t will be\n|\u03c8n\u0304 (t)|2 = \u03b52 tL t,\n\n(37)\n\ninstead of \u03b52 t2 free-space law (24). Indeed, the probability of n \u2212 n\u0304 transition\nbetween the two subsequent collisions with the walls is \u03b52 t2L , while the number\nof collisions during the observation time is (t/tL ). The extrapolation between\nthe laws (24) and (37) will be discussed in the next publication.\n\n5\n\nAcknowledgements\n\nThe author is deeply grateful to Yu.A.Kamyshkov for grabbing him into the\nsubject and presenting a clear introduction.
