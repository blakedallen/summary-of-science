We find that most Na I D1 brightness is not chromospheric but\nsamples the magnetic concentrations that make up the quiet-Sun network in the photosphere, well\nbelow the height where they merge into chromospheric canopies, with aureoles from 3D resonance\nscattering. The line core is sensitive to magneto-acoustic shocks in and near magnetic concentrations,\nwhere shocks occur deeper than elsewhere, and may provide evidence of heating sited deep within\nmagnetic concentrations.\nSubject headings: Sun: photosphere \u2013 Sun: chromosphere \u2013 Sun: magnetic fields \u2013 Sun: faculae, plages\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\nThe past decade saw a rapid advance of our understanding of fine structure and dynamics in the\nlower atmosphere of the Sun by combination of highresolution observations with increasingly realistic numerical simulations.\nExamples are the formation\nof the solar granulation (Nordlund et al. 2009) and\nreversed granulation (Leenaarts & Wedemeyer-B\u00f6hm\n2005, Cheung et al. 2007), and the magnetoconvective\norigin of intergranular bright points (e.g., Shelyag et al.\n2004). Such studies focused mainly on photospheric\nstructure, and assumed local thermodynamical equilibrium (LTE) in both the numerical simulation and the\nsubsequent spectral-line synthesis.\nThe present frontier in this type of research is to\nstudy solar fine structure higher up in the solar atmosphere, including the chromosphere. There the magnetic field fans out and becomes more homogeneous, but\nshocks cause fine-scale structure and dynamics; LTE is no\nlonger valid. Observationally, high-resolution and rapidcadence imaging is required in spectral lines that sample\nthese higher layers, with sufficient spectral resolution to\nchart and follow their small-scale and fast profile variations. At present only imaging Fabry-P\u00e9rot spectrometers at ground-based telescopes with adaptive optics\nperform this task adequately, sampling the few chromospheric lines in the red part of the visible spectrum.\nIn radiation-magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations, such upward advance requires full threedimensionality and tackling the challenging complexities of non-LTE (NLTE) radiative transfer and nonequilibrium ionization/recombination balancing within\nthe simulation. Post-processing in the form of subseElectronic address: jorritl@astro.uio.no\n\nquent synthesis of spectral diagnostics requires 3D NLTE\nradiative transfer, in some cases even with partial frequency distribution. In this paper we make such an upward move for the quiet-Sun atmospheric regime sampled\nby the the Na I D1 resonance line at 5895.94 \u00c5. This line\nis often taken to be chromospheric, but we show here\nthat it is much less so than Ca II 8542 \u00c5 or H\u03b1.\nRecently, observational comparisons using Fabry-P\u00e9rot\nspectrometry were made between Ca II H & K and Ca II\n8542 \u00c5 by Reardon et al. (2009) and between Ca II\n8542 \u00c5 and H\u03b1 by Cauzzi et al. (2009). Leenaarts et al.\n(2009) compared Fabry-P\u00e9rot observations in Ca II\n8542 \u00c5 with numerical synthesis of this line from a 3D\nMHD simulation snapshot. The present paper is a companion to the latter study (hereinafter Paper I), using\nthe same snapshot but turning to the Na I D1 line. The\nmajor modeling advance in both papers is the incorporation of 3D NLTE radiative transfer for the profile synthesis of the respective line. Complete frequency redistribution is assumed and is in order (Uitenbroek 1989;\nUitenbroek & Bruls 1992).\nHowever, instantaneous LTE ionization equilibrium\nwas assumed within the MHD simulation itself. Most\nimportantly, it was assumed for hydrogen even though\nthe studies by Carlsson & Stein (2002) in 1D and by\nLeenaarts et al. (2007) in 2D have shown that this is\nnot an accurate assumption. Compared to LTE, hydrogen is underionized in hot shocks and overionized in cool\npost-shock conditions. Both are due to a large ionization timescale compared to the hydrodynamic evolution\ntimescale. Improved treatment is highly desirable, but\nits implementation in 3D MHD simulation codes presents\nformidable challenges including severe processing-speed\nrequirements. Paper I and the present paper therefore\nrepresent steps along the arduous obstacle course towards\n\n\f2\nrealistic ab-initio simulation of the chromosphere, but\nnot the final one.\nIn solar spectrum atlases Na I D1 is about five times\nweaker than Ca II 8542 \u00c5 in equivalent width, but its\nline center reaches deeper, about 200 K lower in brightness temperature. Na I D1 and Ca II 8542 \u00c5 indeed differ in various formation properties. Na I D1 is a strongly\nscattering resonance line from an easily ionized minority\nstage; Ca II 8542 \u00c5 is an excited line of the dominant calcium ionization stage and has larger source-function coupling to the local temperature. These differences make\nit worthwhile to employ and compare both lines.\nIn the next section we present and discuss highresolution spectrally-resolved imaging of a quiet-Sun area\nin Na I D1 . We then use 3D NLTE synthesis of this line\nin the MHD simulation snapshot of Paper I to analyze\nits formation in quiet-Sun conditions (Section 3). We\ndiscuss the results in Section 4 and conclude the paper\nin Section 5.\n2. OBSERVATIONS\n2.1. Data acquisition\n\nWe use imaging spectroscopy data obtained with\nthe Interferometric BIdimensional Spectrometer (IBIS)\nat the Dunn Solar Telescope (DST) of the U.S. National Solar Observatory/Sacramento Peak. IBIS consists of two Fabry-P\u00e9rot interferometers mounted in\nseries and delivers sequences of narrowband images\nwith the spectral passband stepping quickly through\nmultiple user-selectable spectral lines (Cavallini 2006;\nReardon & Cavallini 2008). In this particular sequence,\nobtained during 15:30\u201317:07 UT on April 18, 2008, IBIS\nsampled Na I D1 with a passband of 23 m\u00c5 FWHM,\nCa II 8542 \u00c5 with a passband of 43 m\u00c5 FWHM, H\u03b1\nwith a passband of 22 m\u00c5 FWHM, and Fe I 7090 \u00c5 with\na passband of 24 m\u00c5 FWHM. Additional images were\ntaken in the G band with an independent camera using\nan interference filter of 10 \u00c5 FWHM. One of the two\nadaptive-optics feeds at the DST (Rimmele 2004) served\nto stabilize the telescopic image and to correct wavefront\ndeformations in real time; the G-band images were additionally improved through speckle reconstruction. The\n30 \u00d7 54 Mm2 field of view covered a quiet solar area near\nthe edge of an equatorial coronal hole at apparent disk\ncenter (heliocentric longitude 0.56\u25e6 W, latitude 5.3\u25e6 S)\nwith a pixel scale of 0.083 arcsec/pixel (close to critically\nsampling the 0.16 arcsec diffraction limit of the 76 cm\ntelescope at Na I D1 ). As part of a service-mode observing program with Hinode a full-Stokes scan obtained with\nthe Hinode/SP spectropolarimeter in the Fe I 6302.5 \u00c5\nline between 14:32\u201316:00 UT overlapped with a portion\nof the IBIS field of view.\n2.2. Results\n\nThe IBIS images shown in Figures 1\u20133 were taken between 15:54:53\u201315:55:17 UT and were selected as the\nsharpest of the sequence. The narrowband spectral images were additionally corrected by the application of destretching vectors derived from simultaneous broadband\nreference images. The dashed box in Figure 1 specifies\nthe overlap with the Hinode/SP Stokes scan shown in\nFigure 2. The solid box outlines the subfield selected for\n\nFigure 3, chosen because it covers a similar area as our\nsimulation with a comparable amount of magnetic network, including the most prominent bright points marking magnetic concentrations. However, only its righthand half overlaps with the Hinode/SP scan.\nThe four images in Figure 1 differ clearly in their portrayal of the solar atmosphere, ranging from the photospheric G-band image at left to the chromospheric H\u03b1\nimage at right. These two extremes display characteristic\nquiet-Sun scenes. The G-band image shows regular deepphotosphere granulation with relatively few bright points\nmarking strong-field magnetic concentrations, such as\nthe network patch within the solid box. The H\u03b1 image\nshows chromospheric fibrils (or alternatively \"mottles\",\nbut we use the term \"fibril\" for any elongated H\u03b1 structure), shorter and more irregularly shaped than would\nbe the case in regions with larger magnetic activity. The\nfibrilar structure is more pronounced around the photospheric network.\nThe two intermediate images differ significantly from\nboth the outer ones and also between each other. The\nCa II 8542 \u00c5 image shows some of the same fibrils seen\nin H\u03b1 around denser network, but in the quiet internetwork it shows a dark background with small roundish\nbrightness patches that are mostly due to acoustic shocks\n(cf. Cauzzi et al. 2009). This regime was called \"clapotisphere\" by Rutten (1995), denoting sub-canopy domains\nwith sufficiently weak field that acoustic and gravity\nwaves can run up, become shocks, and interfere in intricate patterns. Similar patterns occur in field-free hydrodynamical simulations (Wedemeyer et al. 2004).\nThe Na I D1 image (second panel) shows essentially no\nfibrilar structure, with only occasional glimpses of short\nand bright elongated structures. The brightest G-band\nbright points show up as co-spatial bright-point features,\nbut with wide bright aureoles around them. The dark\ninternetwork areas show vague pattern similarities with\nthe Ca II 8542 \u00c5 image. Thus, at first sight Na I D1\nseems to sample the same internetwork waves, and possibly clapotispheric shocks, with photospheric magnetic\nconcentrations visible as bright points with aureoles. The\nsame is shown in the similar but lower-resolution images\nof Al et al. (2002).\nWith the lack of fibrils and only a few strong bright\npoints in this quiet-Sun region, the Na I D1 image appears rather featureless. This apparent blandness is a\nsolar property, since the broadband images taken simultaneously with the spectral images show excellent sharpness, especially near the adaptive-optics lock point (located in the subfield shown in Figure 3). Righini et al.\n(2009) have shown that IBIS achieves near diffractionlimited image quality in its narrowband channel. Only\nsmall-scale features with very low contrast might drown\nin the photon noise set by the average line-core intensity\nof 2000 photons/pixel during the 50 ms exposures. The\nvariation in the appearance of the bright aureoles among\ndifferent bright points and at different wavelengths shows\nthat they do not result from scattering in the instrument\nor the Earth's atmosphere.\nFigure 2 confirms the identification of Na I D1 bright\npoints as magnetic concentrations.\nThis part of\nthe Hinode/SP Stokes scan lasted from 15:51:23 until\n15:59:38 UT, so that it is not fully co-temporal with the\n\n\f3\n\nFig. 1.- Images from the DST. Panels: (a) G band, (b) Na I D1 , (c) Ca II 8542 \u00c5, (d) H\u03b1. The latter three are constructed from the\nIBIS profile samplings by determining the intensity of the line profile minimum per pixel, in order to compensate for Dopplershifts from\nvertical bulk motions. The dashed box shows the overlap with the Hinode/SP magnetograms in Figure 2. The solid box is the subfield\nselected in Figure 3.\n\nNa I D1 images. Nevertheless, there is remarkable correspondence between the brightest Na I D1 features and\nstrong longitudinal field, much more than with the (generally much weaker) transversal field.\nFigure 3 contains enlargements of the selected subfield.\nThe magnetogram in panel (c) shows the signed longitudinal flux density but has only partial overlap. Panel\n(d) adds a filtergram display of the Na I D1 intensity,\ni.e., with the IBIS passband at the nominal rest wavelength of the line, as compared to the image generated\nusing local Doppler compensation in panel (e). The two\npanels have the same greyscale. The brightest features\nare brighter in panel (d) due to large central downflows\nwhich can be seen in panel (f) as three tiny very dark\npatches in the middle of magnetic concentrations. Three\nother magnetic concentrations display comparably narrow updrafts. These motions Doppler-shift the line core\nout of the passband, causing additional brightening, as\nalso pointed out by Al et al. (2002). Such mixing of\nDopplershift and intensity modulation generally affects\nstandard fixed-wavelength narrow-band filtergrams. We\ntherefore plot Doppler-compensated line-center intensities rather than rest-wavelength line-center intensities,\nso that brightness variations are more indicative of the\nsource function than of the velocity field in the line forming region. The larger-scale patterning in panel (f) has\nno obvious correspondence to the other panels.\nThe upshot of this section is that the Na I D1 core\nbrightness seems to coincide more with the photospheric\nStokes-V magnetogram signal than with fibrilar structure seen in Ca II 8542 \u00c5 and H\u03b1. This suggestion\nagrees with the earlier conclusion of Cauzzi et al. (2000)\nfrom lower-resolution (spatial and spectral) data that the\nNa I D2 core intensity correlates well with the apparent\nmagnetic flux density in network (above 50 Mx cm\u22122\nin their Figure A1). Figure 1 indicates that Na I D1 in\n\nthe internetwork may show some clapotispheric intensity\nmodulation caused by waves and shocks, mimicking those\nin Ca II 8542 \u00c5, but none of the chromospheric structure\nseen in H\u03b1.\n3. SIMULATIONS\n3.1. MHD simulation snapshot\nWe used a snapshot from a radiation-MHD simulation computed with the Oslo Stagger Code (OSC,\nHansteen et al. 2007). The same snapshot was used in\nPaper I. OSC includes an LTE equation of state based on\nthe Uppsala Opacity Package (Gustafsson 1973) and uses\nradiative transfer with multi-group opacity binning following Nordlund (1982) and NLTE scattering following\nSkartlien (2000) to compute radiative losses in the photosphere and low chromosphere. Radiative losses in the\nmiddle and upper chromosphere are evaluated with an\nescape probability method including continua and lines\nof hydrogen plus lines of Ca II. It was calibrated with the\n1D RADYN code (e.g., Carlsson & Stein 1997). Higher\nup, OSC employs optically thin radiative cooling. Thermal conduction along magnetic field lines is taken into\naccount. More detail is given in Hansteen et al. (2007)\nand Mart\u0131\u0301nez-Sykora et al. (2008, 2009).\nThe simulation used here has a grid of 256 \u00d7 128 \u00d7 160,\ncorresponding to a physical size of 16.6 \u00d7 8.3 \u00d7 15.5 Mm3 .\nIt extends from 1.5 Mm below the photosphere to 14 Mm\nabove it, i.e., from the upper convection zone into the\ncorona. The grid has 65 km horizontal resolution. The\ngrid is non-uniform in the vertical direction; its resolution\nvaries from 32 km in the convection zone to 440 km in\nthe corona. The snapshot contains bipolar magnetic field\nwith a mean strength of 150 gauss in the photosphere.\n3.2. Radiative transfer\n\nFor the radiative transfer computation of the emergent\nNa I D1 intensity the atmosphere was interpolated in the\n\n\f4\n\nFig. 2.- Na I D1 profile-minimum intensity compared with longitudinal and transverse magnetograms for the overlap between\nthe IBIS and Hinode/SP fields of view. Panel (a): the intensity\nof the Na I D1 profile minimum per pixel, as in Figure 1. Panel\n(b): apparent longitudinal flux density. Panel (c): apparent transverse flux density. The flux density greyscale ranges from -441 to\n+629 Mx cm\u22122 for panel (b) and 0 to +338 Mx cm\u22122 for panel\n(c). The average measured flux density over the field-of-view is 70\nMx cm\u22122 .\n\nvertical direction onto a grid with 153 points covering a\nheight range between \u22120.5 and 2 Mm relative to continuum optical depth \u03c45000 = 1, covering the formation\nrange of all pertinent sodium transitions. The electron\ndensity was computed assuming LTE ionization for all\nrelevant species, including hydrogen, consistent with the\nLTE equation-of-state used in OSC. The angle quadrature was computed using the A4 set of Carlson (1963),\nemploying 3 rays per octant. The gas motions in the\nsimulation were taken into account without adding additional microturbulence.\nThe radiative transfer computation was performed\nusing MULTI3D (Botnen 1997; Leenaarts & Carlsson\n2009), a code based on the 1D code MULTI of Carlsson\n(1986) and including the same physics, but with a 3D\nshort-characteristics solver allowing evaluation of the 3D\nradiation field. MULTI3D has been MPI-parallellized using domain decomposition so that it runs efficiently on\nsupercomputers.\nSince 3D radiative transfer remains very demanding,\nthe actual Na I Grotrian diagram was simplified to a minimal model atom. Inspired by the results of Bruls et al.\n(1992), we constructed a model atom of only four levels,\n\nconsisting of the ground state, the upper level of Na I D1 ,\nan extra level at 1 eV below the continuum, and the Na II\nground state as continuum. We gave the extra level normal collisional coupling to the two lower levels but enormous (105 in excess of normal values) collisional boundfree coupling to the continuum and large (Gaunt factor\n2.2) radiative coupling to the upper level of Na I D1 . We\nadded this extra level to implement the suction process\nidentified by Bruls et al. (1992) which draws population\nfrom the ion reservoir into the Na I D ground state. We\nadjusted its strong couplings such that it has similar suction power as the complete full-atom upper term structure, which we determined by comparing the resulting\nNa I D1 level populations to those of the full 18-level\nmodel atom specified in Table 2 of Bruls et al. (1992)\nfor the standard 1D FALC atmosphere of Fontenla et al.\n(1993). The result is shown in Figure 4. The emergent profiles in the upper panel are nearly equal. The\nlower panel compares the NLTE population departure\ncoefficients bi \u2261 nNLTE\n/nLTE\nfor the lower and upper\ni\ni\nNa I D1 level between the two model atoms. They match\nvery well, especially over the most important range z =\n0.4 \u2212 0.6 Mm where the line core becomes optically thin.\nThe steep increase of the b1 departure coefficient is due\nto the dominance of photoionization over collisional ionization, but sufficient suction is needed to match it with\nthe small atom. Slightly larger differences occur deeper\ndown, where both small-atom curves miss the slight overpopulation in the FALC temperature minimum due to\nlack of photon suction in weaker lines. However, the ratio b2 /b1 remains nearly equal between the two models so\nthat the Na I D1 source functions are nearly equal; only\nthe optical-depth buildup below the formation height of\nthe line core differs somewhat. This simple model atom is\naccurate enough for our purposes. We used it to compute\nemergent Na I D1 profiles from the simulation snapshot,\nboth treating each column as a plan-parallel atmosphere\nand in full 3D, assuming complete redistribution which\nis a good assumption for this line (Uitenbroek & Bruls\n1992).\n3.3. Snapshot properties\nFigure 5 displays simulation results in the form of horizontal cuts through the snapshot cube at four different\nheights, specified at the top of each column.\nThe first row shows how the magnetic field is organized\nin small-scale intergranular magnetic concentrations, especially at lane vertices, that expand with height as in\nthe classical fluted fluxtube paradigm (e.g., Spruit 1977;\nSolanki 1987, 1993). At z = 0.0 Mm (upper-left panel)\nthey do not appear as roundish fluxtubes but rather\nas extended features similar to the G-band \"ribbons\"\nand \"flowers\" in observations with comparable resolution\n(Berger et al. 2004; Rouppe van der Voort et al. 2005).\nThe expansion with height is striking (note the scale reduction to seven times lower amplitude at z = 0.9 Mm).\nThe actual field is bipolar with a roughly even split between positive and negative concentrations, as shown in\nthe first panel (where the field is mostly near-vertical).\nThe temperature cut at z = 0.0 Mm in the second row\nshows granulation. At z = 0.3 Mm the brightness pattern has changed into reversed granulation; the strongest\nmagnetic concentrations stand out by being hotter than\ntheir surroundings at equal geometrical height. Higher\n\n\f5\n\nFig. 3.- Details of the subfield marked by the solid box in Figure 1. Panels: (a) G band, (b) Ca II 8542 \u00c5, (c) longitudinal field, (d)\nNa I D1 intensity at the nominal line-center wavelength, (e) Na I D1 intensity of the profile minimum per pixel with the same greyscale as\npanel (d), (f) Dopplershift of the profile minimum per pixel, with the greyscale ranging from \u22122 km s\u22121 (dark, downflow) to +2 km s\u22121\n(bright, upflow).\n\nFig. 4.- Comparison of Na I D1 line formation in the FALC\natmosphere between the 18-level (black curves) and 4-level (grey\ndashed curves) model atoms. Upper panel: emergent line profiles\nat \u03bc = 0.95. Lower panel: NLTE population departure coefficients\nfor the lower (n = 1) and upper (n = 2) level of the line.\n\nup, fairly large dark patches (\"clouds\") of very cool gas\noccur, with hot white borders indicative of shocks. They\noccur preferentially near magnetic polarity changes.\nThe gas density (third row) shows the familiar evacua-\n\ntion of magnetic concentrations. At z = 0.0 Mm these are\nsuperimposed on the higher-density intergranular lanes\nthat appear as negative of the temperature pattern. At\nz = 0.3 Mm the tops of the largest granules are densest. The magnetic evacuation persists at all sampled\nheights, spreading with the field strength but maintaining co-spatiality with the photospheric topology up to\nz = 0.6 Mm. In the z = 0.9 Mm panel the gas density shows slender high-density features that likely mark\nshock interference.\nThe electron density (fourth row) mimics the temperature closely at all heights because both the hydrogen\nionization balance and the electron-donor (Si, Fe, Al,\nMg, Ca, Na) ionization balances are computed in LTE.\nAt z = 0.3 Mm most magnetic concentrations have low\nelectron density due to low overall gas density, but the\nhottest show excess electron density from donor ionization. The Ne /NH ratio of electron to hydrogen density\n(not shown) reaches values as low as 10\u22126 in the coolest\nclouds in the higher layers, well below the 10\u22124 relative abundance of the electron donor elements, implying that even these are largely neutral. The thin hightemperature shocks around the cool clouds have large\nelectron densities.\nThe vertical velocity pattern in the bottom row shows\nthe familiar pattern of granular upflow and downflow in\nthe photosphere. Its amplitude diminishes rapidly with\nheight. Higher up, the most striking features are large\ndowndrafts in most of the stronger magnetic concentrations, in particular the strongest one at (x, y) = (8.2, 7.2).\nThey survive up to z = 0.9 Mm. The upflow patterns resemble the gas density patterns.\n3.4. Emergent Na I D1 profiles\n\nFigure 6 compares the spatially-averaged Na I D1 profile from the simulation with the spatially-averaged IBIS\nobservation and with a solar-atlas profile. The agreement\nbetween the IBIS and atlas profiles is excellent. The simulation deviates in producing a slightly deeper core and\nnarrower inner wings, with more pronounced knees. This\nlack of core broadening is similar to, but smaller than for\n\n\f6\n\nFig. 5.- Properties of the simulation snapshot. All panels show xy-cuts through the simulation cube at the heights specified at the\ncolumn tops, with z = 0 Mm corresponding to spatially-averaged \u03c45000 = 1. Each row displays the quantity specified with its units at the\nright-hand side, from top to bottom: magnetic field strength, gas temperature, mass density, electron density, vertical velocity (bright for\nupflow). Each panel is greyscaled to maximum contrast, with the range specified along each panel top. The top-left panel displays the\nmagnetic field strength multiplied with the sign of Bz (upwards bright) to show the polarity distribution.\n\nFig. 6.- Comparison of spatially-averaged observed and simulated Na I D1 line profiles. Grey curve: averaged disk-center intensity from the NSO Fourier Transform Spectrometer (FTS) atlas\ncalibrated by Neckel & Labs (1984). Red curve and red plus sign:\nIBIS observation. Black curve: simulation. Both the FTS atlas\nand the simulation provide absolute intensities. The IBIS data\nwere scaled to match the FTS profile in the line core.\n\nthe Ca II 8542 \u00c5 line in Figure 1 of Paper I. The latter\nwas attributed, at least partially, to a lack of spatial resolution in the microturbulence-free simulation. Since we\nuse the same snapshot, this deficiency also applies here.\nHowever, its effect is probably smaller because Na I D1 is\nformed lower than Ca II 8542 \u00c5 whereas the temperature\nand density in Figure 5 show an increase in fine-structure\namplitude with height.\nFigure 7 displays properties of the Na I D1 spectral\nprofiles that emerge vertically from the top of the simulation volume, in the form of images comparable to the\nlower row in Figure 3. The wing image in the first panel\nserves as low-photosphere indicator, showing the magnetic concentrations as bright points. The blue Na I D1\nwing was not included in our earlier survey of proxymagnetometry diagnostics (Leenaarts et al. 2006), but it\nis comparable to the other strong-line wings there. The\nmagnetic concentrations gain contrast because of weaker\ndamping wings, and, in the case of Na I D1 also because\nof enhanced ionization from partial evacuation.\nThe second panel of Figure 7 emulates a narrow-band\n\n\f7\n\nFig. 7.- Na I D1 synthesis with the 3D solver, except for panel\n(c). The intensity maps show the vertically emergent intensity from\nthe simulation. From top to bottom: (a) intensity in the blue wing\nat \u2206\u03bb = \u22120.27 \u00c5 from nominal line center; (b) intensity at the\nnominal line center (rest wavelength); (c) intensity in the profile\nminimum per pixel, using the 1D solver; (d) intensity in the profile\nminimum per pixel; (e) Dopplershift of the profile minimum per\npixel (upflows bright); (f) \u03c4 = 1 height for the profile minimum per\npixel. The dotted line near y = 2.0 Mm specifies the cut location\nused in Figure 8. The three symbols in the bottom panel specify\nthe locations for which Na I D1 formation breakdown is given in\nFigure 9.\n\nfiltergram with the passband at nominal line center. The\nstrongest magnetic concentration appears very bright,\nmostly through downdraft Dopplershift as demonstrated\nin Figure 9. The rest of the scene vanishes by setting the\ngreyscale to include this feature.\nPanels (c) and (d) compare 1D plan-parallel percolumn radiative transfer with full 3D radiative transfer, plotting the profile-minimum intensity per pixel in\norder to compensate for bulk-motion Dopplershifts. The\ngreyscales are identical. The scenes are comparable but\nthe magnetic concentrations reach larger contrast in the\n1D case. In 3D, radiation scatters out of these and illuminates their surroundings, as shown below.\nPanel (e) maps the Dopplershift of the line profile minimum per pixel. The greyish small-amplitude bright\nand dark patterning resembles the z = 0.9 Mm verticalvelocity sampling in the last panel of Figure 5. The larger\nmagnetic-concentration downdrafts mimic those in the\nz = 0.6 Mm panel most closely. Narrow bright structures\ndue to upward-propagating shocks appear elsewhere.\nFinely structured bright shocks and dark clouds appear abundantly in panel (f), which displays the geometrical height where radiation at the wavelength of the\nprofile minimum per pixel reaches optical depth unity.\nThe range is very large, varying from z = 0.5 Mm in\nthe cool clouds to z = 1.1 Mm in the shock fronts.\nThis rugged height-of-formation pattern is effectively a\nmap of the Na I/Na II ionization-recombination balance\nand is closely similar to the electron density pattern at\nz = 0.9 Mm in Figure 5, adding the slender high-density\nfeatures in the panel above it.\nIn the cool clouds sodium is nearly completely ionized.\nThis counterintuitive result (one would expect sodium to\nbe largely neutral at these temperatures and densities) is\nexplained as follows: The electron density in the model\natmosphere is computed in LTE and the cool clouds\nhave thus a low electron density. The NLTE sodium\nionization-recombination balance is set by the interplay\nof photoionization versus photorecombination requiring\none electron. The photoionization rate per sodium atom\nis independent of temperature, as it is set by the radiation field. The recombination rate per sodium atom\nhowever depends on the electron density. In the lowtemperature clouds the electron density is low, thus\nthe recombination rate is low and as a consequence the\nionization-recombination balance shifts towards Na II.\nThe Na I D1 \u03c4 = 1 height map obtains its enormous\nvariation and fine structure from the large variations in\nelectron density affecting the sodium recombination. The\nDopplershift map in panel (e) follows this \u03c4 = 1 height\nvariation; it samples the Dopplershift in magnetic concentrations and cool clouds deeper in the atmosphere\nthan in hot shocks..\nNote that the \u03c4 = 1 height variation would be even\nlarger if we had not plotted \u03c4\u03bd = 1 for the Dopplercompensated profile minimum per pixel but \u03c4\u03bd0 = 1 at\nthe nominal line center as in a narrow-band filtergram.\nIn that case Dopplershifts would cause even deeper linecenter formation, as deep as z = 0.3 Mm in the downdrafts in the magnetic concentrations (Figure 9).\n3.5. Comparison of 3D and 1D modeling\n\nFigure 8 compares our 3D evaluation of Na I D1 formation to the 1D one by showing an xz-cut through the\n\n\f8\n\nFig. 8.- Comparison between 1D and 3D Na I D1 line-center formation along the xz-cut near y = 2.0 Mm marked by the dotted line in\nFigure 7. Panels (c) to (h) have the \u03c4 = height overplotted for the 3D (black) and the 1D solver (grey). Panels: (a) emergent intensity for\nthe 3D (black curve) and 1D (grey curve) solver in radiation temperature units; (b) magnetic field strength; (c) contribution function for\nthe 3D solver; (d) gas temperature; (e) 1D radiation field; (f) 3D radiation field; (g) 1D source function; (h) 3D source function; (i) 1D\nsource function on line-center \u03c4\u03bd0 -scales per column; (j) 3D source function on line-center \u03c4\u03bd0 -scales per column.\n\nsimulation volume along the y = 2.0 Mm dotted line in\nFigure 7 where it passes through the second-brightest\nmagnetic concentration in panels (b) and (c). The magnetic concentration stands out in panel (b) of Figure 8,\nwhich also illustrates its upward field spreading, and in\npanel (d) as a relatively hot deep finger. The cut passes\nthrough a few more intergranular lanes with fairly strong\nfield but no vertex concentration, and samples a high cool\ncloud at x = 2.5 Mm and a low one at x = 8.9 Mm.\nThe first panel shows the vertically emergent intensity at the nominal line-center wavelength along the cut,\ngiven in equivalent brightness-temperature units to facilitate comparison with panels (d)\u2013(j). The 3D curve\nhas an aureole around the magnetic concentration and\nis generally much brighter and smoother than the 1D\ncurve. Panel (c) displays the 3D vertical contribution\nfunction in color. The nominal line-center \u03c4\u03bd0 = 1 heights\nare overplotted, also in panels (d)\u2013(h) as reference; they\ndo not differ much between 3D and 1D. The line-center\nformation height varies from z \u2248 0.4 Mm in the magnetic\nconcentration to z \u2248 1.1 Mm in the hot rim of the deep\ncool cloud that appears as a filamentary feature in the\nz = 0.6 Mm temperature panel of Figure 5. The other\nupward spikes in panel (c) sample similar features, all\nwith very wide contribution functions. The cool clouds\ncause \u03c4\u03bd0 = 1 dips.\nThe lower three rows of Figure 8 analyze Na I D1\n\nsource function properties, at left for the 1D case and\nat right for the 3D case. Panels (e) and (f) map the\nprofile-averaged angle-averaged radiation field\nZ \u221eZ 2\u03c0 Z \u03c0\n1\nJ\u2261\nI\u03bd \u03c6(\u03bd \u2212\u03bd0 ) sin \u03b8 d\u03b8 d\u03c6 d\u03bd,\n(1)\n4\u03c0 0 0\n0\nwith I\u03bd the local specific intensity, \u03c6(\u03bd \u2212 \u03bd0 ) the local\nNa I D1 area-normalized extinction profile, \u03bd the frequency, \u03bd0 the nominal line-center rest frequency, and\n\u03b8 and \u03c6 specify the viewing angle in spherical coordinates. The other panels map the total source function\nat \u03bd = \u03bd0 . It can be written, dropping frequency indices,\nas:\nS = (1 \u2212 \u03b5) (1 \u2212 \u03b7) J + \u03b5 (1 \u2212 \u03b7) B(T ) + \u03b7 (1 \u2212 \u03b5) B \u2217 (2)\nwhere J represents the Na I D1 photon reservoir, B(T )\nthe thermal reservoir, and B \u2217 the reservoir for roundabout paths (in particular recombination cascades) that\nmay populate the upper level and hence produce line\nphotons. B \u2217 is only a formal Planck function, not necessarily corresponding to the local temperature. The coefficient \u03b5 is the thermal line-photon destruction probability by collisional deexcitation after photoexcitation in\n\u2212\nthe Na I D1 transition and through H photoionization\nas background continuum process. The profile weighting\nwith the latter contribution makes the total source function frequency-dependent, even though the line source\n\n\f9\nfunction is not for complete redistribution. The coefficient \u03b7 is the probability of line-photon conversion via\nother \"interlocking\" sodium transitions from the upper\nlevel (in particular photoionization).\nPanels (e) and (f) are identical in deep layers where\nJ \u2248 B. Higher up, the two panels appear identical also,\nin this case because their structure is dominated by the\nthermal broadening in the \u03c6(\u03bd \u2212 \u03bd0 ) profile weighting.\nTowards the corona (note that the red color in panel\n(d) represents the cutoff at T = 104 K, the actual temperatures are higher) the line profile becomes so wide\nthat J approaches the emergent-continuum value with\nTrad \u2248 5100 K (see the 500 nm panel of Figure 36 of\nVernazza et al. 1981, or Figure 3 of Bruls et al. 1992).\nIn the 1D case this part (orange) is patterned as vertical search-light beams above hot granules. They are\nwashed out in the 3D case. Similar wash-out occurs in\nthe blue-black regime with Trad < 3600 K where Na I D1\nis formed; for example, the cooler areas above \u03c4 = 1 in\npanel (d) become black in panel (e) but are filled with\nwarmer radiation in panel (f). The scattering contribution dominates the source function in panels (g) and (h)\nin the blue domain around z = 1.0 Mm, but higher up the\n\u03b5 B(T ) and \u03b7 B \u2217 contributions mix in, the first producing\nthe thin bluish-white curve marking the temperature rise\nto the corona (where \u03b5 is negligible), the second producing the slanted greenish features below this curve. The\n\u03b5 B(T ) contribution is the same in 1D and 3D because\nit is local, but there is marked difference between 1D\nand 3D for the \u03b7 B \u2217 contribution due to non-local ionizing ultraviolet radiation. However, these contributions\nare too high up to affect the Na I D1 brightness, as is\ndemonstrated in panels (i) and (j) by plotting the source\nfunction per vertical column on the relevant part of the\ncorresponding line-center \u03c4\u03bd0 scale. The magnetic concentration is the hottest feature crossing the \u03c4\u03bd0 = 1 line;\nall other locations sample the blue J-dominated scattering regime, of which the columnar structure in 1D\nexplains the modulation of the corresponding intensity\ncurve in panel (a). The 3D curve corresponds to the\nwash-out of this structure in panel (j). The 3D source\nfunction in panel (h) shows a slanted dynamic fibril originating from the magnetic concentration, appearing as\na substantial low-reaching green \u03b7 B \u2217 contribution, but\neven this does not affect the last panel because \u03c4\u03bd0 = 1\ndeepens within the concentration. Thus, this 3D simulation confirms the 1D conclusion of Bruls et al. (1992)\nthat the source functions of the Na I D lines are dominated by resonance scattering.\n3.6. Na I D1 formation in specific features\nThe first quartet of Figure 9 is a graphical breakdown of Na I D1 formation for the brightest magnetic\nconcentration marked with a plus sign in Figure 7, using the format developed by Carlsson & Stein (1994,\n1997) for Ca II H2V grains. It rewrites the contribution function to the vertically emergent intensity CI =\ndI\u03bd /dz = S\u03bd exp(\u2212\u03c4\u03bd ) \u03c7\u03bd , with \u03c7\u03bd the total extinction\ncoefficient, into a product of the three terms \u03c7\u03bd /\u03c4\u03bd , S\u03bd ,\nand \u03c4\u03bd exp(\u2212\u03c4\u03bd ) that are plotted as greyscale quantities in the first three panels with CI as their product\nin the fourth one. The three terms in this decomposition demonstrate that a large contribution to intensity is\n\nmade at those positions that have a large opacity at low\noptical depth, with a high source function around optical depth unity. The line source function in the second\npanel is frequency-independent because of the assumption of complete redistribution. Strictly speaking one\nshould plot the total source function here. However, to\nincrease readability we avoid the cluttered modulation of\nthe frequency-dependent total source function and plot\nthe line source function instead. This is justified because\nthe line source function becomes equal to the continuum\nsource function in the deep-formed LTE wings, and dominates the total source function in the scattering line core.\nThe emergent Na I D1 profile in the last panel of the\nfirst quartet is very asymmetric. It shows a bright hump\nat nominal line center that causes the extraordinary\nbrightening of this feature in the second panel of Figure 7. The actual line core is redshifted over 7 km s\u22121 .\nThe formation mechanism of this profile is rather similar to the formation of internetwork Ca II H2V grains. A\nlarge (10 km s\u22121 ) downdraft in high layers moves the core\nopacity redward. Its inward integration at the profile\nminimum reaches \u03c4 = 1 at z = 0.5 Mm, where the source\nfunction is dominated by scattering and has uncoupled\nfrom the Planck function. The profile minimum is much\ndarker than the emergent intensity at nominal line center. However, it still stands out in the Dopplershiftcompensated panels of Figure 7, evidencing a relatively\nhigh source function notwithstanding the signature loss\nby scattering. Figure 7 suggests that the same occurs in\nother magnetic concentrations.\nSeveral circumstances conspire to produce the bright\nhump in the profile at nominal line center. Because of\nthe gradient in the downflow velocity there is a location\nwith high \u03c7\u03bd /\u03c4\u03bd at \u2206\u03bd = 0 and z = 0.3 Mm (upperleft panel). This location happens to lie close to optical\ndepth unity at that frequency (lower-left panel). Most\nimportantly, the source function is not yet completely\nset by scattering, and partially follows the increase of the\nPlanck function above z = 0.1 Mm (dotted line, upperright panel). This gives rise to the local maximum in\nthe source function in the upper-right panel of the first\nquartet. All effects combined yield a high contribution\nfunction (lower-right panel) and thus a peak in the profile. There is no corresponding peak at the red side of\nthe profile because \u03c7\u03bd /\u03c4\u03bd (upper-left panel) is low where\n\u03c4\u03bd = 1 coincides with the location of the source function\nmaximum because of the velocity gradient in the atmosphere.\nThe second quartet of Figure 9 shows a similar breakdown at the asterisk in the cool cloud in the bottom panel\nof Figure 7. In this case the profile asymmetry is minor,\nthere are only a small downdraft below z = 0.3 Mm and\na small updraft above this height. The Planck function\n(dotted) drops steeply to 2400 K at z = 1.0 Mm. The\nsource function happens to follow it far out, but it actually uncouples already at z = 0.2 Mm where scattering\nsets in. It levels out at a radiation temperature 3100 K\nnear z = 0.6 Mm where \u03c4\u03bd0 = 1. The resulting line core is\nvery dark.\nThe third quartet of Figure 9 shows another breakdown\nfor the slender hot front marked with a rhombus in the\nbottom panel of Figure 7, where Na I D1 has maximum\nformation height with \u03c4\u03bd0 = 1 at z = 1.1 Mm. The Planck\nfunction has an extended minimum for T \u2248 5000 K\n\n\f10\n\nFig. 9.- Na I D1 and Ca II 8542 \u00c5 formation breakdown for the three locations marked in the bottom panel of Figure 7. The first three\nquartets are for Na I D1 , the lower-right one for Ca II 8542 \u00c5. In each quartet, each greyscale image shows the quantity specified in its\ntop-left corner as function of frequency from line center (in Dopplershift units) and simulation height z. Multiplication of the first three\nproduces the intensity contribution function in the fourth panel of each quartet. A \u03c4\u03bd = 1 curve (grey) and the vertical velocity (white)\nare overplotted in each panel, with a vz = 0 line in the first panel for reference. The upper-right panel of each quartet also contains the\nPlanck function (dotted) and the line source function (dashed), in equivalent temperature units specified along the top. The lower-right\npanel also contains the emergent intensity profile, as brightness temperature with the scale along the right-hand side. The first quartet is\nfor the brightest magnetic concentration at the location marked with a plus in the bottom panel of Fig 7. The second quartet is for the\ncool cloud marked by the asterisk in the same figure. The third quartet is for the hot front marked by the rhombus. The final quartet is\nfor the same location but shows the formation breakdown for Ca II 8542 \u00c5.\n\n\f11\nand then rises steeply with height, through 6000 K at\nz = 1.1 Mm, but this is not followed by the source function which uncouples much deeper and has a radiation\ntemperature of 3400 K at z = 1.1 Mm. Thus, although\nNa I D1 is formed very high at this location, it does not\nshow the relatively high temperature there. Note the\nlarge difference in line-core formation height between the\ncool cloud of the second quartet and the hot front of third\nquartet. This is caused by the strong dependence of the\nNa I D1 opacity on the electron density. The cool cloud\nhas a low temperature, hence a low LTE electron density\nand thus a low opacity due to relative lack of photorecombination (see Sec 3.4). The hot front has a relatively\nhigh temperature throughout the whole column, so that\nthe relatively high opacity results in a large formation\nheight.\nFor comparison, the fourth quartet shows the corresponding Ca II 8542 \u00c5 formation breakdown at the location of the hot front, confirming that this line is formed\nhigher and has better coupling to the temperature: this\nlocation is quite bright in Ca II 8542 \u00c5 (Figures 3 and 4\nof Paper I).\n4. DISCUSSION\n4.1. LTE ionization versus non-equilibrium ionization\n\nThe MHD simulation is quite realistic in the photosphere but arguably less so higher up. One obvious\nimperfection is the assumption of LTE Saha-Boltzmann\npartitioning for hydrogen and the electron-donor metals. These are largely neutral in the simulation's cool\nclouds, but sodium gets largely ionized there in our subsequent NLTE statistical-equilibrium modeling for that\nelement because its ionization is dominated by hot photospheric radiation. The same would be the case for\nthe other electron donors in such modeling. Worse,\nCarlsson & Stein (2002) and Leenaarts et al. (2007) have\nshown that for hydrogen the assumption of statistical\nequilibrium fails also, requiring the evaluation of nonequilibrium ionization\u2013recombination balancing in which\nthe past history of a given gas parcel affects its state, in\nparticular suffering slow recombination in the cool aftermath of a fast-ionizing hot shock passage. Similar\nslowness may affect other electron-donor elements, although hydrogen is likely the worst. Therefore, the low\nelectron densities in the cool clouds in Figure 5, with\ntheir large effect on the Na I D1 \u03c4 = 1 height in the bottom panel of Figure 7, are likely artifacts. The actual\nelectron density may remain as high as Ne /NH \u2248 10\u22122\n\u2212\nin shocked gas, causing up to 104 increase in H opacity and therefore increased radiative heating above the\n\u2212\nphotosphere wherever the H bound-free continuum has\nJ\u03bd > B\u03bd . So perhaps the cool clouds will not become\nso cool in the case of non-equilibrium ionization. On\nthe other hand, slow balancing affects the energy budget intrinsically by not instantaneously converting thermal energy into ionization or releasing it in recombination, resulting in larger temperature contrast across\nshocks (Carlsson & Stein 1992) and longer-lived cooler\npost-shock temperatures (Leenaarts et al. 2007). It is\nhard to predict what cool clouds future simulations with\nimproved ionization treatment will produce, but probably these will have larger electron density than the cool\nclouds here, and possibly larger Na I D1 opacity.\n\n4.2. Chromosphere or clapotisphere\nSince we use only a single snapshot of the simulation\nhere, we cannot identify the nature of its fine structure\nin higher layers; that would require analysis of its temporal evolution. Nevertheless, comparison with the 2D\nsimulation of Leenaarts et al. (2007) and the 3D simulation of Mart\u0131\u0301nez-Sykora et al. (2009) suggests that many\nof the fine-scale features in Figures 5\u20138 are due to shock\ndynamics, with slanted wave-guiding along field lines in\nthe neighborhood of the magnetic concentrations producing short dynamic fibrils (see Hansteen et al. 2006;\nDe Pontieu et al. 2007; Paper I). The scene in the rightmost column of Figure 5 consists of slender hot shock\nfronts and cool expansion clouds. There appear to be no\nlong fibrils in the simulation that would be comparable\nto those typically observed near network in H\u03b1 and in\nCa II 8542 \u00c5 (Figure 1). This is consistent with the observed Na I D1 profile minimum intensity image shown\nin Fig. 1 which also shows almost no evidence of fibrils\nin this quiet region.\nThe simulated Ca II 8542 \u00c5 line-center image from the\nsame snapshot in Figure 3 of Paper I does not contain\nsuch long fibrils either, and shows larger disparity with\nthe observed line-center scene than occurs here between\npanel (e) of Figure 3 and panel (d) of Figure 7. We therefore conclude that the simulation does not contain the\ndense carpets of extended fibrils that constitute the magnetically dominated chromosphere, but that it models\nwhat we call the clapotisphere quite well. The simulation\nis a fair description of what is observed in Na I D1 but\nis deficient in H\u03b1-type fibrils in Ca II 8542 \u00c5. Such deficiency doesn't really matter for Na I D1 because its intensity is determined well below the clapotispheric regime\nanyhow: although its \u03c4\u03bd0 = 1 height in the third quartet\nof Figure 9 is clapotispheric, the source function there is\ndominated by J photons originating much deeper. Only\nthe core Dopplershift is set at clapotispheric heights, but\nonly outside the transparent cool clouds.\n4.3. Magnetic concentrations in Na I D1 and Ca II\n\n8542 \u00c5\nThe magnetic concentrations appear bright in both the\nobservations and the simulation, even after compensation\nfor the Dopplershift imposed by the large downdrafts\nthat tend to occur at their locations, also both in the\nobservations and the simulation. In the simulation this\nbrightness is due to higher-than-elsewhere temperatures\nin the upper photosphere (z = 0.3 Mm temperature panel\nof Figure 5).\nNear and within magnetic concentrations, field-guided\nshocks tend to appear deeper than elsewhere, as\nwas already shown in the classical 2D simulation\nof Steiner et al. (1998) and confirmed later by the\ndynamic fibril studies of Hansteen et al. (2006) and\nDe Pontieu et al. (2007). The strong narrow downdrafts\nin most magnetic concentrations (bottom row of Figure 5) may be post-shock downdrafts. As diagnosed\nin the first quartet of Figure 9, they cause magneticconcentration brightening with a similar formation mechanism as the asymmetric Ca II H & K violet-wing brightening in non-magnetic H2V and K2V grains. These\nsample the sub-canopy shocks in the internetwork at\nz \u2248 1 Mm. Na I D1 is formed much lower and samples\n\n\f12\nonly the deep-sited shocks in and near magnetic concentrations. The formation of Ca II 8542 \u00c5 is intermediate;\nthe large brightness of the magnetic concentration in Figure 4 of Paper I is similarly formed through higher-up\ndowndraft.\nThe breakdown for the magnetic concentration in Figure 9 shows a raised temperature (Planck function in the\nsecond panel) over z = 0.3 \u2212 0.8 Mm; it is the hottest location in the z = 0.3 Mm temperature panel of Figure 5.\nThe other magnetic concentrations have similarly raised\ntemperatures at this height. The corresponding source\nfunction hump at z = 0.3 Mm, which produces the bluewing peak at nominal line center, lies within the upper\nphotosphere outside, in the reversed granulation regime\n(Figure 5).\nThe vertical velocity curve in the first quartet Figure 9\n(overplotted in all panels) displays a series of steps suggesting shock passages. If so, these are less well defined,\nwith less obvious response in temperature, than those in\nFigures 5\u20137 of Carlsson & Stein (1997) from their nonmagnetic H2V grain simulation with the 1D RADYN\ncode. That code used an adaptive mesh and had much\nbetter vertical resolution than the fixed mesh of OSC.\nAlso, in 3D shocks are likely not to run up straight\neven within magnetic concentrations. Analysis of the\nfull time-dependent simulation will tell whether this velocity pattern indeed stems from shocks, and may establish whether shock heating matters in setting this deepseated temperature increase in magnetic concentrations,\nas suggested by the high correspondence between excess\ntemperature and excess downdraft in magnetic concentrations in the second column of Figure 5.\n4.4. Comparison between observation and simulation\n\nThe observed and simulated scenes in panel (e) of Figure 3 and panel (d) of Figure 7 show similar morphology.\nWithin the simulation, Na I D1 is primarily a magneticconcentration mapper in its brightness distribution, sampling these in the upper photosphere and including wide\nscattered-light aureoles. Elsewhere, the line-center intensities are fully dominated by scattering, producing very\ndark source function sampling with much wash-out of\nthermal structure. Since these formation characteristics\nare primarily photospheric, where we believe our simulation to be realistic, we suggest that the same apply to\nthe Sun.\nIn the simulation only the core Dopplershifts, imposed\nat the last scattering, are likely to sample clapotispheric\nheights, and that only outside the cool clouds where\nsodium is fully ionized. The Dopplershift map in panel\n(f) of Figure 3 has similar slender magnetic-concentration\ndowndrafts as in the companion panel (f) of Figure 7\nbut less other fine structure, in particular missing out on\nthe considerable downflows in cool clouds and the sharp,\nslender upflow features from hot shocks that the simulation presents. These differences may be attributable\nto lack of resolution in the observations and/or overestimation of clapotispheric dynamics in the simulation. At\nthis stage, we can't tell.\n5. CONCLUSIONS\n\nBased on the analysis of our simulation we conclude\nthat the brightest quiet-Sun features observed in the core\nof Na I D1 are also the deepest: magnetic concentrations\n\nsampled at z \u2248 0.3 \u2212 0.5 Mm. The lower height holds\nwhen one does not compensate for Dopplershifts in the\nline-center sampling and a core shift causes additional\nbrightening. This happens in particular when the magnetic concentrations harbor higher-layer downdrafts producing blue-wing peaks through the same line-formation\nmechanism that causes non-magnetic internetwork H2V\nand K2V grains in Ca II H & K. Such downdrafts occur in\nmost magnetic concentrations in the simulation and seem\nto occur regularly also in the observations, although even\nour high-resolution IBIS imaging barely resolves them.\nThe next brightest component in quiet-Sun Na I D1\nscenes are relatively bright aureoles surrounding the\nmagnetic concentrations, due to resonance scattering of\nNa I D radiation from the magnetic concentrations. This\nis very much a 3D phenomenon requiring 3D NLTE modeling, as demonstrated in Figure 8.\nElsewhere, quiet-Sun Na I D1 scenes are dark even\nthough at certain locations the formation height may be\nlocated much higher up, around z = 1 Mm within hot\nclapotispheric shock fronts. Their high temperature has\nno response in the Na I D1 source function due to the\nstrong resonance scattering in this line, but it does for\nthe Ca II 8542 \u00c5 line which combines higher formation\nwith better temperature sensitivity.\nThe upshot is that in quiet-Sun areas the Na I D1\ncore displays primarily an upper-photosphere rendering\nof magnetic concentrations on the solar surface, with\nroughly the same surface patterning as in unsigned magnetograms or in proxy diagnostics such as G-band and\nH\u03b1-wing bright points, but contaminated with brightening from downdrafts and 3D-scattered aureoles. This\nsimilarity explains the correlation between photospheric\nmagnetic flux density and Na I D1 core brightness reported by Cauzzi et al. (2000), and it makes Na I D1 just\nanother photospheric-field indicator in irradiance monitoring. It is not a chromosphere diagnostic, not even a\nuseful clapotisphere one. Only usage of information imposed at the last scattering (Dopplershift, polarization)\nseems of interest, but that suffers from the large variation\nin the height of the \u03c4 = 1 surface at line center.\nThe magnetic concentrations in the simulation are hotter at the z = 0.3 \u2212 0.5 Mm Na I D1 line-center sampling\nheight than the outside upper photosphere with reversed\ngranulation. Further analysis of the full time-dependent\nsimulation may clarify how this heating comes about;\nNa I D1 may be useful to constrain the mechanism.\nJL acknowledges financial support by the European\nCommission through the SOLAIRE Network (MTRNCT-2006-035484).
