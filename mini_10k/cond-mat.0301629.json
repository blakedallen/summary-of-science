K. Rajagopal\nNaval research Laboratory, Washington D.C. 20375 \u2013 5320\nABSTRACT\nThe concepts of quantity of heat and work are deduced in the nonextensive statistical mechanics context, following steps in parallel to those\nemployed in the extensive statistical mechanics.\n1. INTRODUCTION\nIt is known that the Boltzmann-Gibbs (BG) statistical mechanics fully\ndescribes the thermal equilibrium state of Hamiltonian systems[1]. In recent\nyears, BG description is defied by a large class of non-equilibrium stationary\nstates such as glasses. A generalization of BG formalism to accommodate\nsuch systems has been proposed by Tsallis in 1988, which will be referred\nhere as Tsallis (T) statistical mechanics. This is accomplished by relaxing\nthe extensivity assumption involved in the formulation of the BG entropy.\nFor a review of this development, see [2 - 6]. This formalism closely\nparallels the BG theory in spite of changing the form of the entropy in\nhaving a corresponding generalized maximum entropy principle, and the\nLegendre transform structure required for formulating the attendant\nthermodynamics. At the dynamical foundation level, the ergodicity property\nin phase space used in BG formalism is replaced by non-ergodicity in the T\nformalism. One may note that while the BG theory involves exponential\nclass of probability distributions, the T theory has power-law distributions,\nwhich are found to be quite commonly found in nature where systems are in\npenultimate non-equilibrium states before reaching the eventual thermal\nequilibrium. The purpose of this paper is to present a corresponding\nthermodynamic identification of terms within the T theory, even though\nsimilar work based on entirely different approach to this by Abe [7] exists.\nThis alternate derivation is thus complimentary to Abe's work even though it\nparallels a different set of steps (given above for BG) in obtaining\nthermodynamic concepts from statistical mechanics.\nIn the next section we set the stage for this development by giving an\naccount of the traditional BG approach along with a discussion of \"quasiequilibrium\" based on the quantum master equation of the Lindblad type[8].\nThis is followed by sec.3, describing the alternate derivation mentioned\nabove. Some comments on the corresponding quasi-equilibrium theory will\n1\n\n\falso be briefly discussed. In the final sec.4, a summary of this development\nis given.\n2. BOLTZMANN-GIBBS APPROACH\nIt is common knowledge [1] that deducing the laws of\nthermodynamics from statistical mechanics of many particle systems as\nformulated by BG depends on the identification of certain terms in the two\nformalisms. Let us recapitulate how this is accomplished in the standard\ntextbooks, such as [1]. The BG statistical mechanics of a many-particle\nsystem is described in terms of the density matrix, \u03c1, given its Hamiltonian\noperator, H. Its total energy is defined by\nU = Tr\u03c1 H ,\n\n(1)\n\nwhere Tr stands for the trace over the space of the many-particle system.\nThe entropy, S1 , of this system is defined by the expression,\nS1 [\u03c1] = \u2212Tr\u03c1 ln \u03c1 ,\n\n(2)\n\nin units where the Boltzmann constant is taken to be unity. Using the\nmaximum entropy principle subject to the constraints of given mean energy\nU defined above and the conservation of probability defined by Tr\u03c1 = 1, we\nobtain the density matrix description of the statistical mechanical\nequilibrium state of the system, with\n\n\u03c1eq = Z \u22121 exp\u2212 (\u03b2H ), Z = Tr exp\u2212 (\u03b2H ).\n\n(3)\n\nHere \u03b2 is a Lagrange multiplier, which will be identified with the inverse\ntemperature of the system in the thermodynamics language. Z is called the\npartition function. One then identifies the thermodynamic quantities, the free\nenergy F, the entropy S, and the mean energy U, associated with the system\nin the following way:\n\n[ ]\n\n\u22121\n\u22121\nF = \u2212 \u03b2 ln Z = U \u2212 \u03b2 S, S \u2261 S1 \u03c1eq .\n\n(4)\n\nThis identification is in complete concordance with all the thermodynamic\nprinciples associated with the system [1]. To make connection with the\nthermodynamic concepts of \"quantity of heat\", Q, and \"work\", W, we follow\n\n2\n\n\f[1], by considering a quasi-equilibrium variation of the average value of H\ndefined in eq.(1), which clearly has two parts, one arising from change in the\nHamiltonian, H, and the other arising from the concomitant change in the\ndensity matrix, \u03c1 , near its equilibrium:\ndU = TrH (d\u03c1) + Tr (dH )\u03c1.\n\n(5)\n\nWe then identify the quantity of heat with the first term and the work with\nsecond term:\ndQ = TrH (d\u03c1), dW = Tr (dH )\u03c1 .\n\n(6)\n\nBy considering quasi-static processes near equilibrium, one may then\ncapture all the thermodynamic concepts such as adiabatic and isothermal\nprocesses, Carnot cycle, etc. in the Statistical Mechanics parlance. For a\ndiscussion of this, one may refer to [9].\nWe now discuss briefly the quasi-static development. The most\ngeneral quantum master equation which is linear, local in time, preserves the\nessential properties of the density matrix, namely hermiticity, traceclass\n(probability conservation) structure, and positive semi-definiteness is the\nLindblad equation [8] (units where the Planck constant, h is set equal to 1):\n\n\u2202\u03c1 \u2202t = \u2212i [H, \u03c1 ]+\n\n1\nk j {2L j \u03c1 L+j \u2212 L+j Lj \u03c1 \u2212 \u03c1 L+j Lj }\n\u2211\n2 j\n\n(7)\n\nwhere the first term in the right hand side represents the unitary time\nevolution driven by H, a hermitian Hamiltonian operator and the second\nterm represents dissipative evolution if all the real parameters k j are\npositive, accomplished by the operators Lj along with their hermitian\nconjugates, L+j . This choice of operators is not unique and the sum over j is\nas yet unspecified. The unitary time evolution part may be subsumed by a\ntransformation \u03c1d = U \u03c1 U + , so that the new equation has no H-term but has\nmodified L-operators, L \u0303 . This equation has two additional features, one, it\ncan take a pure state into a mixed state and vice versa, and two, it preserves\npositivity of the density matrix throughout the evolution. This last property\nis often violated in phenomenological master equations. Since the density\nmatrix is hermitian, a diagonal representation for it can be chosen\n\u03c1d = \u2211 \u03b1 p(\u03b1 ) \u03b1 , where {\u03b1 } is an orthonormal set for each instant of\n\u03b1\n\n3\n\n\ftime. p(\u03b1 ) have the same physical interpretation as the probabilities in a\nclassical description of the system.\nWith the choice of the entropy functional in the von Neumann form,\neq.(2), we now calculate \u2202S1 \u2202t :\n\n\u2202S1 \u2202t = \u2212Tr \u2202\u03c1 \u2202t ln \u03c1 = \u2211 K\u03b1\u03b1 ' p(\u03b1' )(ln p(\u03b1' ) \u2212 ln p(\u03b1 )) \u2265 0\n\n(8)\n\n\u03b1 ,\u03b1 '\n\nprovided the Lindblad operators are hermitian. Here K\u03b1\u03b1 ' = \u2211 ki \u03b1 L \u0303i \u03b1 ' .\n2\n\ni\n\nThis follows after using ln x \u2265 1\u2212 1 x, x > 0, and upon interchanging\nsummation indices and definitions. Thus the increase of entropy is\nguaranteed under the above condition. Under such a condition, one also\nfinds that the right hand side of modified eq.(7) takes the form,\n1\n\u2212 \u2211 k j L \u0303 j , L \u0303 j , \u03c1d .\n2 j\nAnother important aspect of eq.(7) concerns its stationary solution, \u03c1s ,\nsatisfying \u2202\u03c1 \u2202t = 0. This will now be shown to be also the asymptotic, long\ntime solution of eq.(7). A particular form of the stationary solution obeys the\n\"microscopic detailed balance\" relation given by\n\n[ [\n\n]]\n\nK ab ps (b) = K ba ps (a) for all pairs a, b.\n\n(9)\n\nThe subscript s here denotes the stationary limit of the eq.(7) introduced\nhere:\n\n\u2202\u03c1ds \u2202t = 0 =\n\n{\n\n}\n\n1\nk j 2 L \u0303 j \u03c1ds L \u0303+j \u2212 L \u0303 +j L \u0303 j \u03c1 ds \u2212 \u03c1ds L \u0303+j L \u0303 j .\n\u2211\n2 j\n\n(10)\n\nThe stationary density matrix can also be expressed in terms of its diagonal\nrepresentation as before: \u03c1ds = \u2211 a p s (a) a , { a } an orthonormal set for\na\n\nasymptotic, stationary time limit. These are in general different from those\ndefined before at any given instant, t. These states now appear in defining\nthe detailed balance condition in eq.(9) above.\nWe may now compare the general solution with the asymptotic solution by\nconsidering the Kullback \u2013 Leibler (KL) relative entropy,\nK (\u03c1 \u03c1s ) \u2261 Tr\u03c1 (ln \u03c1 \u2212 ln \u03c1s ) \u2265 0 . The time derivative of this expression after\n\n4\n\n\fsome manipulations (after making the assumption of \"microscopic detailed\nbalance\" , eq.(9) [10, 11]) is given by\n\uf8ee\uf8eb p (t )\uf8f6 \uf8eb p (t) \uf8f6 \uf8f9 \uf8ee \uf8eb p (t) \uf8f6\n\uf8eb p (t) \uf8f6 \uf8f9\n1\nb\na\nb\n\uf8f7\uf8f7 \u2212 \uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\uf8f7 \uf8fa \uf8efln \uf8ec\uf8ec\n\uf8f7\uf8f7 \u2212 ln\uf8ec\uf8ec a \uf8f7\uf8f7 \uf8fa\n\u2202K (\u03c1 \u03c1s ) \u2202t = \u2212 \u2211 K ab pbs \uf8ef\uf8ec\uf8ec\n2 a,b\n\uf8ef\uf8f0\uf8ed pbs \uf8f8 \uf8ed pas \uf8f8 \uf8fa\uf8fb \uf8ef\uf8f0 \uf8ed pbs \uf8f8\n\uf8ed pas \uf8f8 \uf8fa\uf8fb\n(11)\nWe obtain \u2202K (\u03c1 \u03c1s ) \u2202t \u2264 0 because (x \u2212 y )ln(x y ) \u2265 0 when x, y are both\npositive. Thus the general solution approaches the asymptotic one if the\nmicroscopic detailed balance holds.\nThe mean value of any physical quantity, for example the system\nenergy, is defined by eq.(1) is expressed in the form U = \u2211 \u03b1 H \u03b1 p(\u03b1 ) . If\n\u03b1\n\nwe employ the maximum entropy principle subject to this given mean\nenergy, then the resulting density matrix is given by\n\n\u03c1eq = exp \u2212 (\u03b2H ) Z , Z = Tr exp \u2212 \u03b2H\n\n(12)\n\nwhere \u03b2 is a Lagrange multiplier, the inverse temperature in units where the\nBoltzmann constant is taken to be unity. Z here is the partition function. In\nthis theory then, the equilibrium density matrix given in eq.(11) leads to the\nknown thermodynamic relation between the free energy, F, the entropy, S,\n\u22121\n\u22121\nand the mean energy, U: F = \u2212 \u03b2 ln Z = U \u2212 \u03b2 S, S \u2261 S1 \u03c1eq .\n\n[ ]\n\nA quasi-equilibrium variation of this average value can come about by\nvariations in H and in \u03c1 , dU = Tr(d\u03c1 )H + Tr \u03c1(dH ) . Following [1], we may\nidentify \"work\", dW = Tr\u03c1(dH ) , and \"quantity of heat\", dQ = Tr(d\u03c1)H ,\nquite generally. If we consider the variation to come about by time\nevolution, then we find that\ndK \u03c1 \u03c1 eq\ndp(\u03b1 )\ndS1 dt \u2212 \u03b2 dQ dt = \u2212\u2211\n(ln p(\u03b1 ) \u2212 ln peq (\u03b1 )) = \u2212 dt\ndt\n\u03b1\n(13)\nwhere we used the KL relation between the density matrix and its\nequilibrium counterpart, eq.(11), and the result mentioned above. The last\nterm in this equation is often called the \"entropy production\" and this is\npositive. This type of thermodynamic result was deduced in [10] for weak\ncoupling of the system with the heat bath.\n\n(\n\n5\n\n)\n\n\f3. TSALLIS APPROACH\nThis is a reworking of the results of Abe [7] in terms of the q-enropy\nwithout invoking the non-additive property or any other relation arising from\nzero-th law of thermodynamics as was done in [7]. Such an alternate version\nis illuminating in that it gives a different perspective to these results starting\nfrom statistical mechanical considerations alone. The q-entropy is given by\nq\nSq = (Tr\u03c1 \u2212 1) (1\u2212 q )\n\n(14)\n\nq here is a real parameter. For q=1 we recover the BG entropy, eq.(2). If we\ncall c q \u2261 Tr \u03c1 q , then we have the relation\n\n[\n\n]\n\nq\nc q \u2261 Tr \u03c1 = 1 + (1 \u2212 q)Sq .\n\n(15)\n\nThe normalized density matrix that maximizes the q-entropy in eq.(14)\nsubject to the constraint\nU q = TrPq H, Pq = \u03c1 Tr\u03c1 , and Tr\u03c1 = 1,\nq\n\nq\n\n(16)\n\nis found to be\n\n[\n\n]\n\n\u03c1q = 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 q )\u03b2 c \u2212q 1 (H \u2212 U q )\n\n[\n\nZq = Tr 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 q)\u03b2 c\n\n\u22121\nq\n\n1 (1 \u2212q )\n\n(H \u2212 U )]\n\n1\n\nZq\n(17)\n\n(1 \u2212 q )\n\nq\n\nwhere \u03b2 is a Lagrange multiplier associated with the q-energy constraint,\neq.(16). Henceforth we introduce \u03b2 q = \u03b2 c q . From eq.(17) and (15), we also\nhave the relationship\n\n[\n\n]\n\nc q = (Zq ) as also Z q = Tr 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 q )\u03b2 q (H \u2212 U q )\n1 \u2212q\n\nq (1 \u2212q )\n\n.\n\n(18)\n\nCalculating the derivative of the partition function, Zq , with respect to U q ,\nwe have\n\n6\n\n\f\u2202Z q\n= \u03b2 q Zq ,\n\u2202Uq\n\n(19)\n\nand so the corresponding derivative of the q-entropy however is found to be\n\n\u2202Sq\n\u2202\n1\n1\u2212 q\n=\nZq \u2212 1) = \u03b2 .\n(\n\u2202Uq (1\u2212 q ) \u2202U q\n\n(20)\n\nThis result is a consequence of the variational character of the relations used\nhere and not invoking the zero-th law of thermodynamics.\nAbe[7] made use of the definition of \"pressure\" in his derivation but\nhere we base our derivation on only the equilibrium statistical mechanical\ndefinition of normalized q-mean energy, eq. (16) and the definitions given\nby eqs.(14 \u2013 20). Thus we have the following relations:\nTr\u03c1 = 1 \u21d2 Tr(\u03b4\u03c1) = 0.\n\n(21)\n\nqTr\u03c1 q\u22121 (\u03b4\u03c1)\n.\n\u03b4 Sq =\n(1 \u2212 q)\n\n(22)\n\nUsing eq.(17) for the density matrix that maximizes the q-entropy subject to\nthe q-mean energy, eq.(16), we obtain\n\n\u03b4 Sq =\n\n{ [\n\n]}\n\nq cq Tr (\u03b4\u03c1) 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 q)\u03b2q (H \u2212 Uq )\n\n(1 \u2212 q )\n\n(23)\n\nWe now compute the change in the internal energy defined by eq.(16). This\ninvolves a change in the Hamiltonian and a change in the density matrix and\nthis is expressed in the form:\n\uf8ee\nTr\u03c1 q \u22121 (\u03b4\u03c1 )(H \u2212 U q )\nTr\u03c1 q (\u03b4H )\uf8f9\n\uf8ef\u03b4U q \u2212\n\uf8fa=q\n,\ncq\ncq\n\uf8ef\uf8f0\n\uf8fa\uf8fb\nand again using eq.(17), after a little manipulation we obtain,\n\n7\n\n(24)\n\n\f{ [\n\n]}\n\n\uf8ee\nTr\u03c1 q (\u03b4H )\uf8f9 qTr (\u03b4\u03c1) 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 q )\u03b2q (H \u2212 Uq )\n\uf8ef\u03b4U q \u2212\n\uf8fa=\n.\ncq\n(1 \u2212 q)\u03b2 q\n\uf8ef\uf8f0\n\uf8fa\uf8fb\n\n(25)\n\nThis derivation is based on a perturbation theory which was not required in\nthe traditional theory. This point will be commented upon later. Combining\neqs.(23, 24), we obtain the following thermodynamic relation obtained by\nAbe [7], if we make the identification, \u03b4Sq = \u03b2\u03b4Qq = \u03b2 q cq \u03b4Qq ,\n\uf8ee\nTr\u03c1 q (\u03b4H )\uf8f9\n\uf8ef\u03b4U q \u2212\n\uf8fa = \u03b2 q c q\u03b4Qq .\ncq\n\uf8ef\uf8f0\n\uf8fa\uf8fb\n\n(26)\n\nNote that the idea of pressure is not introduced in obtaining this expression\nfor the notion of \"heat\" from statistical mechanics!\nQuite generally, we may identify eq.(24) as the \"q - quantity of heat\",\n\u03b4Qq , so that combined with eq.(22), we obtain the q-version of eq.(13):\n\n( )\n\n\u03b4Sq \u2212 \u03b2\u03b4Qq = \u2212cq \u03b4 \u03c1 K q \u03c1 \u03c1q ,\nor equivalently,\n\n(c ) \u03b4S\n\u22121\n\nq\n\nq\n\n(27)\n\n( )\n\n\u2212 \u03b2q \u03b4Qq = \u2212\u03b4 \u03c1 K q \u03c1 \u03c1 q .\n\n(28)\n\n1\n1 \u2212 Tr\u03c1 q \u03c3 1\u2212 q } and\n{\n1\u2212 q\n\u03c3 = \u03c1 q is given by eq.(17). The RHS of eq.(28) may be identified with the\n\"q-entropy production\" in analogy with its q=1 counterpart discussed earlier,\neq.(13).\nIt may be worthwhile to point out that the above derivation is not\nrigorous because it is based on a perturbation theory around \u03c1q . In the\ntraditional quantum version of the theory given in sec.2, the density matrix\nappeared linearly and so such a perturbation argument was not essential. But\nin the quantum version of the T theory, since general power of the density\nmatrix appears, a rigorous discussion based on infinitesimal change in the\ndensity matrix is subtle and does not proceed as smoothly as in the q=1 case.\nWhat is here presented is a heuristic approach which clearly exhibits the\ntroubles with proper quantum theory in the T formulation of quasiIn the above the q-KL is defined as K q (\u03c1 \u03c3 ) =\n\n8\n\n\fequilibrium theory. With this caveat, we have here given a derivation that\nmay be of some interest to the reader.\n4. SUMMARY AND CONCLUDING REMARKS\nWe have given here the Tsallis generalization of the known (q=1)\nstatistical mechanics derivation of the thermodynamic relations concerning\nentropy, quantity of heat, etc., but with the caveat mentioned above. This\ndevelopment is complementary to that of Abe [7] without invoking\nthermodynamic concepts. Here we use only statistical mechanical concepts\nand identify the thermodynamic entities in a parallel fashion to those given\nin text books [1] as in BG statistical mechanics. By analogy with the usual\nthermodynamics, these concepts can be used to define q-adiabatic and qisothermal processes. Such a discussion of the corresponding q-KL version\nof [9] in relation to other thermodynamic relations such as Carnot cycles etc.\nneeds a more rigorous examination and will be reported in a separate\ncommunication.\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\nIt is a pleasure to thank Professor Sumiyoshi Abe for encouraging me to\nmake known this work to others besides him! Thanks are due to him for\nemphasizing to me the subtle nature of the quantum theory of the density\nmatrix formulation of the T theory.
